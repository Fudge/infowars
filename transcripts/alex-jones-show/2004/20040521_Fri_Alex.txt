[00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:06.201]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.841 --> 00:00:07.922]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.622 --> 00:00:09.742]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.403 --> 00:00:11.203]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:12.824]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.524 --> 00:00:17.345]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:21.767]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:35.660]  Well, you're going to be glad that you tuned in today.
[00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:42.763]  If you want to be truly informed, this is another ultra-massive broadcast.
[00:00:44.223 --> 00:01:00.551]  Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-1-1 Citizens Watch and a contributor to UnansweredQuestions.org, who's been in all of these different commission meetings, the 11 public ones, who was there when Christopher Broder stood up and said, remember your government funded and created Al-Qaeda.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.484]  And then we'll be able to hear all the stuff we missed after they cut the feed on C-SPAN three days ago.
[00:01:10.365 --> 00:01:13.286]  They're joining us in 14 minutes.
[00:01:14.547 --> 00:01:20.210]  The lovely and intelligent and dynamic Stephanie is going to be calling them here in about 10 minutes and getting them on the line.
[00:01:21.937 --> 00:01:34.160]  Then, coming up in the second hour, former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the world, I killed innocent people for our government in the Sacramento Bee.
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.001]  That's right.
[00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:45.423]  Then in the third hour, William Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News, on the Berg beheading and his article, Berg met with Shady Iraqi.
[00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.092]  So we'll be going over that in the third hour.
[00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:54.075]  We'll take some calls today, not in the first hour, we will in the second, and start with those guests.
[00:01:54.095 --> 00:01:57.838]  But in this hour, the next ten minutes, I'm going to go over some of the top stories.
[00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:02.941]  Then we'll get Christopher Broder, who stood up, and we're going to play that clip again.
[00:02:03.942 --> 00:02:05.903]  And, of course, Kyle Hens.
[00:02:06.524 --> 00:02:12.348]  And next week, I've got some of the Widows, who were there standing up as well.
[00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:17.954]  Coming on the broadcast, widows and women who lost their sons and daughters.
[00:02:18.854 --> 00:02:22.696]  That is coming up next week as well.
[00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:28.220]  But in this Friday's edition, we have just got ultra-massive amounts of key news for you.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.563]  Diebold's voting machine expansion rattles investor states.
[00:02:33.583 --> 00:02:36.845]  We'll get into some of the latest election scamming that's going on.
[00:02:37.825 --> 00:02:42.488]  Also, we're going to get into the new details of prison abuse emerge.
[00:02:43.292 --> 00:02:45.194]  Uh, just grisly stuff coming out.
[00:02:45.234 --> 00:02:47.396]  The question is, why are they releasing this?
[00:02:47.436 --> 00:02:49.458]  If they didn't want to release this, they wouldn't be releasing it.
[00:02:50.178 --> 00:02:51.840]  We'll talk about that, uh, bigger picture.
[00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.285]  Beating people to death, posing with their dead bodies, uh, beating them while they're in sexual positions.
[00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:00.788]  And most of these people completely, totally innocent on top of it.
[00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:06.613]  You don't just not torture supposed terrorists, but you don't torture families you pull over on the side of the road.
[00:03:06.713 --> 00:03:08.975]  I don't care what, how sick you are, neocons.
[00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:10.399]  Socialist.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.261]  I mean, I don't know how you got to this psychological point of saying this is all great.
[00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:19.063]  Again, videos amplify a picture of extreme violence.
[00:03:19.423 --> 00:03:21.504]  Bush says Iraq is ready to take power.
[00:03:21.564 --> 00:03:23.405]  That's a total joke, a total fraud.
[00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:26.967]  Military shrugs off attacks on wedding party.
[00:03:27.167 --> 00:03:30.828]  OPEC, not to blame for high oil prices, says the president of OPEC.
[00:03:31.068 --> 00:03:32.049]  And that's actually true.
[00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.129]  I mean, they go over the evidence.
[00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.510]  We don't run this.
[00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.871]  We don't make all the profits.
[00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.851]  We don't control it.
[00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:38.476]  Stop blaming us!
[00:03:38.896 --> 00:03:45.401]  It's the oil companies, and it is the oil companies, but it's easier to blame the Arabs and the Venezuelans, isn't it?
[00:03:46.602 --> 00:03:49.143]  So, we'll be going over that for you.
[00:03:50.204 --> 00:03:55.088]  Also, Ebola-like virus confirmed in western Equatoria.
[00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:58.110]  Scary article out of Africa.
[00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:01.472]  EU supports WTO membership for Russia.
[00:04:01.492 --> 00:04:03.574]  That's part of the global government formation.
[00:04:04.334 --> 00:04:06.856]  Bulldozers keep on demolishing in Rafa.
[00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:18.117]  And there's an editorial in the Washington Times saying press can't get abuse story, they can't let it go, as if people are bad to even be reporting on this.
[00:04:18.318 --> 00:04:20.879]  And more on Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:04:22.881 --> 00:04:32.528]  I typed in Alex Jones Fahrenheit 9-11 and even before this New York Post article yesterday basically saying Moore ripped me off,
[00:04:33.386 --> 00:04:34.667]  It was already being said on the web.
[00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:36.389]  And I'm not saying Moore did that.
[00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.391]  I mean, he can tell the story of 9-11.
[00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:39.972]  It's a public fact.
[00:04:40.432 --> 00:04:45.837]  Just because he tells the story similarly to the way I did it, doesn't mean that he ripped me off.
[00:04:45.897 --> 00:04:46.677]  It's just the facts.
[00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:48.859]  Though he puts his own little U.N.
[00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:49.460]  spin on it.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.602]  I mean, I'm glad Moore's made this film.
[00:04:51.662 --> 00:04:54.604]  It's unfortunate he's put a liberal spin on it.
[00:04:55.165 --> 00:04:56.125]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:56.145 --> 00:04:56.546]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:02.678]  It's finally here!
[00:05:02.838 --> 00:05:03.799]  Spring has arrived!
[00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.960]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:10.641]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:19.004]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:05:19.264 --> 00:05:22.985]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:05:23.205 --> 00:05:28.227]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:33.012]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:05:33.212 --> 00:05:37.276]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:05:37.356 --> 00:05:44.504]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!

[00:06:01.852 --> 00:06:09.242]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:14.248]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:14.488 --> 00:06:20.136]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:20.356 --> 00:06:24.877]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:25.157 --> 00:06:32.260]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.060]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.801]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:39.502]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:06:39.702 --> 00:06:46.424]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:06:46.664 --> 00:06:51.932]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.952 --> 00:06:52.373]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:01.354 --> 00:07:04.335]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:13.498]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:07:13.838 --> 00:07:18.520]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:25.707]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:07:26.108 --> 00:07:37.900]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:42.824]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.327]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:45.347 --> 00:07:47.308]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:51.132]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:05.850]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:08.571]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:28.557]  Remember three days ago during the Rudolph Giuliani whitewash kangaroo court event that some of the widows and some of the men and women who lost children
[00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:41.336]  In the 9-11 globalist attack, in the Phantom Menace attack, they stood up and basically shut the meeting down and C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:45.138]  We've played the clip up to the point that C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:08:45.905 --> 00:09:00.337]  And we're going to find out what else was said and exactly what transpired and why these people have questions coming up here in about five minutes with Christopher Broderb, investigative journalist and activist who confronted Giuliani in the 11th public hearing on the 9-11 Commission.
[00:09:01.017 --> 00:09:10.565]  Also, Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to UnansweredQuestions.org, he was present at the 11th public hearing as well.
[00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:16.239]  Then we've got big guests in the second and third hour, so you'll want to stay with us.
[00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:23.563]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, and now PrisonPlanet.tv as well.
[00:09:25.043 --> 00:09:29.266]  But right now, let's just in the next few minutes jump into some more of the important news.
[00:09:29.686 --> 00:09:38.871]  New photos and video have emerged via the Washington Post, which is the big Bilderberg Group-controlled New World Order propaganda body.
[00:09:40.699 --> 00:09:48.224]  Some of these photos first surfaced a month ago on CBS 60 Minutes, which is, you can't get any more New World Order than that as well.
[00:09:48.724 --> 00:09:52.587]  They've known about this for two years in Afghanistan, for over a year in Iraq.
[00:09:53.488 --> 00:09:57.111]  Photos and videos for years have been all over the foreign media.
[00:09:57.671 --> 00:10:01.494]  Generals have resigned, refusing to torture people at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:10:01.794 --> 00:10:03.355]  I mean, all of this has been public.
[00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:04.496]  We've been talking about it forever.
[00:10:05.669 --> 00:10:07.290]  Why did it just now come out?
[00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:14.452]  Because I said that we had to be humiliated before the UN takes over Iraq here in just about two weeks from now.
[00:10:15.312 --> 00:10:16.632]  Less than two weeks, a week and a half.
[00:10:17.513 --> 00:10:24.735]  Now of course our troops will still be there, we'll just be under UN control and under the new puppet government, the second new government to be appointed.
[00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:29.175]  The Iraqi Council, the first one was appointed, the second one will be appointed.
[00:10:29.435 --> 00:10:31.256]  It is not democracy.
[00:10:31.536 --> 00:10:32.657]  It is not a republic.
[00:10:32.897 --> 00:10:44.823]  It is total dictatorship with regional governors, viceroys over different sectors, exactly like the different imperial governments that have been installed there in the past by the British.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.461]  That's all this is.
[00:10:46.781 --> 00:10:48.642]  So why now is all this coming out?
[00:10:48.782 --> 00:10:58.408]  So they can have a debate about torture, then show the Berg beheading, and then legitimize all of the torture, while at the same time demonizing us overseas.
[00:10:58.868 --> 00:11:02.310]  The propaganda domestically is, this is a wonderful thing, let's just accept it.
[00:11:02.651 --> 00:11:09.875]  Overseas, America is so evil, we need to have the UN come in and run America and defang the dangerous right-wingers.
[00:11:09.915 --> 00:11:12.677]  That's what Michael Moore is saying in his 9-11 film.
[00:11:13.657 --> 00:11:14.118]  In his 9-11 book.
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:17.561]  Dude, where's my country?
[00:11:17.741 --> 00:11:18.382]  We need the U.N.
[00:11:18.422 --> 00:11:19.422]  to take over America.
[00:11:19.482 --> 00:11:20.323]  That is indeed in there.
[00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:24.567]  So see, this is the energizing of the left-wing arm of the world government.
[00:11:24.927 --> 00:11:27.289]  Whereas, again, an arm is attached to a body.
[00:11:27.549 --> 00:11:29.431]  The right arm is attached to the same body.
[00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:31.793]  It is the same system, the same people running it.
[00:11:32.133 --> 00:11:40.120]  They want to keep you in this left-right debate that neutralizes all real political movements and progress.
[00:11:41.681 --> 00:11:46.183]  So, that's the reality here, and new details of prison abuse emerge.
[00:11:46.303 --> 00:11:51.485]  Abu Ghraib, the detainee's statements describe sexual humiliation and savage beatings.
[00:11:51.565 --> 00:11:54.386]  Now they've released more photos and video of this.
[00:11:54.806 --> 00:12:00.808]  Video begins with three soldiers huddled around a naked detainee, his thin frame backed against a wall with a snap of his wrist.
[00:12:01.148 --> 00:12:04.470]  One of the soldiers slaps the man across the left cheek so hard the prisoner's knees buckle.
[00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.911]  Another detainee, handcuffed on his back, is dragged over to the prison floor.
[00:12:08.491 --> 00:12:10.913]  Then it goes on to the beating and the sexual posing.
[00:12:11.453 --> 00:12:17.817]  But notice they're focusing in on England having sex in front of them or people beating them or making them do weird sexual things.
[00:12:18.317 --> 00:12:22.600]  Why aren't they focusing in on the released photos of them posing with people they've beaten to death?
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:31.625]  You notice they're not releasing the photos of them raping women, beating children, and other things I'm not going to mention, which they admit they have photos and video of.
[00:12:31.865 --> 00:12:33.046]  No, they're not going to release that.
[00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:34.647]  They're going to release the lighter stuff.
[00:12:35.807 --> 00:12:39.828]  And they give one of these thugs a year in prison when they openly were following orders.
[00:12:39.848 --> 00:12:44.069]  I think they need a hundred years in prison for raping and torturing and killing.
[00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:52.152]  But understand, the people who gave the orders, they are the cold-blooded masters in all of this.
[00:12:52.252 --> 00:12:56.813]  They are the premeditative murderers and they deserve to be prosecuted.
[00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:03.535]  But don't expect that to happen of Lord Rumsfeld, who Bush says is doing a superb job.
[00:13:04.841 --> 00:13:18.194]  So Bush says Iraqis are ready to take power, Iraqis are ready to take the training wheels off and assume political power for the U.S.-led coalition, President Bush said yesterday, as his administration began to roll out a rough plan for the June 30th transition of authority.
[00:13:18.615 --> 00:13:19.796]  But we've read the plan!
[00:13:20.236 --> 00:13:21.357]  They'll have no authority!
[00:13:22.178 --> 00:13:23.219]  They're told what to do!
[00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.162]  They're appointed by Mr. Bremer!
[00:13:26.703 --> 00:13:28.865]  And now we're going to have Necroponte over there!
[00:13:30.402 --> 00:13:32.103]  Running things after Bremer leaves.
[00:13:32.443 --> 00:13:34.363]  It's a totally staged deal.
[00:13:34.884 --> 00:13:35.444]  I'm sorry.
[00:13:35.464 --> 00:13:45.968]  I mean, if I come into your town with a bunch of thugs, point guns at you, and then appoint five people from the town to be your, quote, leaders, that isn't an election, that isn't freedom, that isn't democracy.
[00:13:46.768 --> 00:13:47.268]  It isn't!
[00:13:47.288 --> 00:13:50.109]  I mean, do I have to explain that that isn't?
[00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:52.830]  Unappointed government is not elected?
[00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:54.871]  And they're calling this the handover?
[00:13:55.131 --> 00:13:57.772]  They're now going to put more troops into Iraq, they're now saying.
[00:13:58.732 --> 00:14:03.620]  We're going to have more troops that are under you in control, with you directing this new government.
[00:14:04.241 --> 00:14:05.403]  And this is a sick joke.
[00:14:06.465 --> 00:14:07.587]  Do we have our guest now?
[00:14:07.607 --> 00:14:13.196]  Oh, we do have Christopher?
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:15.781]  Okay, fantastic.
[00:14:15.801 --> 00:14:23.306]  We're about to go to Christopher Broder, investigative journalist and activist who confronted Giuliani at the hearings a few days ago.
[00:14:23.326 --> 00:14:26.628]  We're going to find out what we missed after C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:14:27.048 --> 00:14:39.936]  But before we go to our guest that we're getting online, let's go ahead and play that audio clip of Christopher Broder confronting Giuliani and bringing up all the key points of, you know, why are you threatening to arrest the whistleblowers?
[00:14:41.037 --> 00:14:45.499]  And then Widow screaming, Building 7, why did it come down?
[00:14:45.539 --> 00:14:46.780]  Why did NORAD stand down?
[00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.621]  Where were the jets?
[00:14:47.681 --> 00:14:51.323]  And then, remember, your government created and funded Al-Qaeda.
[00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.624]  So let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:14:53.644 --> 00:14:55.345]  I'm deeply appreciative of that.
[00:14:56.426 --> 00:15:01.549]  And we may very well want to ask you further questions as we finalize our report.
[00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:09.314]  As a Midwesterner, I might say to you, I've been impressed time and again with the pride you've expressed in New York City.
[00:15:10.385 --> 00:15:20.017]  And I admire that greatly, and I think that may very well be one of the reasons for the success of your leadership.
[00:15:20.057 --> 00:15:22.080]  So we thank you very much for your leadership.
[00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:33.289]  And your cooperation is great.
[00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:34.090]  Thank you.
[00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.471]  Thank you very, very much.
[00:15:56.855 --> 00:16:00.037]  I want to know why 300 firemen died.
[00:16:00.317 --> 00:16:02.958]  And I've got some real questions.
[00:16:02.978 --> 00:16:04.919]  Let's ask some real questions.
[00:16:05.099 --> 00:16:05.940]  Is that unfair?
[00:16:07.921 --> 00:16:09.261]  You know what?
[00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:12.142]  My brother was one of the spiders in that room!
[00:16:12.202 --> 00:16:13.722]  Don't give me any minutes!
[00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:16.303]  Ask really good questions!
[00:16:16.383 --> 00:16:18.283]  And what about the bunker?
[00:16:18.383 --> 00:16:25.085]  You didn't ask him about the bunker, the office where we're seeing Ed and Bunker on fire?
[00:16:25.545 --> 00:16:27.746]  We're going to get ready, I'm getting ready for the next panel.
[00:16:27.766 --> 00:16:29.186]  This will be a short lead.
[00:16:29.306 --> 00:16:32.107]  If you want to be disruptive, you will be removed from this room.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.000]  Alright, folks.
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:41.641]  And then C-SPAN cuts the feed.
[00:17:07.182 --> 00:17:10.323]  And more was said, and this is what we need to have.
[00:17:10.483 --> 00:17:24.728]  Everywhere these criminals go, everywhere this military industrial complex goes, people that carry this attack out, and I'll just say it because the facts are there, we need to be confronting them in their face, exposing them, marches in every town and city, because they're getting ready to carry out more attacks.
[00:17:25.388 --> 00:17:29.169]  And Christopher Broder brought up all the key points, many of them.
[00:17:29.429 --> 00:17:30.909]  You know, these aren't real questions.
[00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.611]  They would ask, why did the White House call the mayor of San Francisco and tell him not to fly to New York the next day?
[00:17:36.371 --> 00:17:37.172]  On September 10th.
[00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:39.894]  These are the type of questions.
[00:17:39.994 --> 00:17:45.419]  Why did you, Mr. Bush, order 160 of the Bin Laden's flown out when all their air traffic was grounded?
[00:17:46.599 --> 00:17:48.461]  There's 600 plus of these questions.
[00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:54.646]  We're about to break, but let's go ahead and bring Christopher Broder up, then we're going to break and bring Kyle Hens up, who was also there.
[00:17:55.066 --> 00:17:58.429]  Christopher, I want to commend you, and I want to thank you for being on our broadcast.
[00:17:59.010 --> 00:17:59.790]  Hello, can you hear me?
[00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:00.491]  Yes, I can.
[00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:02.032]  Oh, well, thanks.
[00:18:02.112 --> 00:18:05.295]  Listening back, that's the first I've actually heard of the full thing.
[00:18:05.703 --> 00:18:08.084]  And it sounds like I raised a lot more hell than I remembered.
[00:18:09.324 --> 00:18:17.667]  Well, also there are some clips where the women are talking about Building 7 and the rest of it, and it's just incredible.
[00:18:18.247 --> 00:18:26.470]  But I want to talk to you about this whitewash commission, and I also want to get into anything else that happened that we missed after C-SPAN cut the feed.
[00:18:27.242 --> 00:18:32.445]  Well, the first question is, am I correct that the entire commission was appointed by Bush, correct?
[00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:33.866]  Oh yeah, by Lord Bush, yes.
[00:18:34.086 --> 00:18:39.630]  And you'll notice that all the media reports yesterday about the commission and the hearing, nobody mentions Bush appointed.
[00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:43.972]  Well, they call it independent, that's like Heinrich Himmler being appointed at one of the Nuremberg trials.
[00:18:44.092 --> 00:18:44.472]  Exactly.
[00:18:45.053 --> 00:18:53.238]  The first thing that can tip off for everybody is that they all leave that key fact out, because if you put that in there, especially here in New York City, if you put Bush appointed, everyone knows what that means.
[00:18:53.358 --> 00:18:55.099]  Oh, that's right, it's a fake commission.
[00:18:55.982 --> 00:18:57.784]  And all the media leaves that fact out.
[00:18:58.785 --> 00:19:00.886]  And I didn't go there to raise hell.
[00:19:01.027 --> 00:19:03.469]  I only went there to see what was going on with my own eyes.
[00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:07.072]  And all it is is a giant worship session, so you got angry.
[00:19:07.332 --> 00:19:08.373]  It was worse than that.
[00:19:09.094 --> 00:19:10.174]  Did you watch it live?
[00:19:10.415 --> 00:19:10.975]  No.
[00:19:11.235 --> 00:19:15.699]  I mean, these guys had months to prepare questions, and they just wanted to say you did a great job.
[00:19:15.819 --> 00:19:20.964]  Well, they talked to all the whistleblowers behind the scenes, and then they have their goons threaten them later to shut up.
[00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:25.421]  Uh, the whole thing was outrageous, and I was biting my lip.
[00:19:25.441 --> 00:19:26.302]  Some people said I was rude.
[00:19:26.402 --> 00:19:27.322]  I waited till the end.
[00:19:27.402 --> 00:19:28.583]  If you heard, that was the end.
[00:19:28.603 --> 00:19:29.584]  They were wrapping up... Rude?
[00:19:29.604 --> 00:19:31.925]  We're talking about the murder of 3,000 people!
[00:19:32.226 --> 00:19:34.687]  Well, I was freaking out at the very beginning.
[00:19:34.707 --> 00:19:39.650]  Giuliani's opening statement, he says, remember, this commission shouldn't be investigating anything but the terrorists.
[00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:41.151]  You know, don't investigate anything.
[00:19:41.191 --> 00:19:42.192]  Stop lifting up rocks.
[00:19:42.697 --> 00:19:44.598]  Don't try and find out what was wrong with the radios.
[00:19:44.618 --> 00:19:45.538]  Don't try and find anything out.
[00:19:45.578 --> 00:19:47.239]  This commission should just blame the terrorists.
[00:19:47.259 --> 00:19:50.200]  Well, sir, the New York Daily News reported the radios didn't malfunction.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:52.181]  They grabbed them under national security.
[00:19:52.881 --> 00:19:53.842]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:19:53.962 --> 00:19:56.343]  We'll come right back with Mr. Broder and Mr. Hens as well.
[00:19:56.783 --> 00:19:59.004]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:21:05.459 --> 00:21:06.079]  Out of time?
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.743]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?

[00:23:02.311 --> 00:23:03.433]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:07.058]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:07.158 --> 00:23:07.599]  Phenol!
[00:23:07.899 --> 00:23:14.968]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:15.509 --> 00:23:19.412]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:19.512 --> 00:23:19.973]  Fragrance?
[00:23:20.333 --> 00:23:25.117]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:29.921]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discolorations, to name a few.
[00:23:30.161 --> 00:23:32.704]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:23:32.964 --> 00:23:36.387]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[00:24:01.385 --> 00:24:06.969]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.884]  Alright, this is the short segment this hour.
[00:24:11.004 --> 00:24:13.468]  There's another long segment, another short segment coming up.
[00:24:13.528 --> 00:24:16.813]  Plenty of time to get into some detail with our two guests.
[00:24:16.913 --> 00:24:19.097]  Then, in the second hour...
[00:24:19.921 --> 00:24:35.392]  Former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the Sacramento Bee and the world, I kill innocent people for our government, than William Bunch, Philadelphia Daily News reporter, about the shady intelligence background and people that Mr. Burke was working with.
[00:24:35.692 --> 00:24:36.713]  That's in the third hour.
[00:24:36.733 --> 00:24:38.434]  I know we've got loaded phones for our guests.
[00:24:38.454 --> 00:24:42.257]  We'll try to take some in about 20 minutes or so, if you want to hold.
[00:24:42.577 --> 00:24:44.899]  Let's go right to our guest, Kyle Hens.
[00:24:45.399 --> 00:25:03.247]  Co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to unansweredquestions.org and Christopher Broder who we're all very impressed with, the guy that stood up and we just played that clip earlier and brought up four or five of the key bullet points to the whitewashers there, the Bush appointed kangaroo commission.
[00:25:04.145 --> 00:25:07.267]  And going now to Kyle Hens, we'll bring you both up.
[00:25:08.148 --> 00:25:09.468]  Kyle, this is a big deal.
[00:25:09.569 --> 00:25:13.351]  You were there, and what was the response of the Commission?
[00:25:13.671 --> 00:25:16.013]  How many people were standing up and speaking out?
[00:25:16.553 --> 00:25:25.118]  How many of the victims' family members were angered by this worship session, this caressing session that we were seeing?
[00:25:25.639 --> 00:25:26.659]  Well, it was stunning.
[00:25:26.899 --> 00:25:30.702]  I mean, to me, this represented a sea change in this whole
[00:25:31.412 --> 00:25:49.980]  This whole process of the families engaging with the Commission, not getting their questions answered, not even getting their questions asked, and it just reached a boiling point for them when Commissioner after Commissioner, keeping praise on Mayor Giuliani and not asking the hard questions.
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:56.962]  And it just, it was like finally the elephant in the room has been acknowledged collectively by the families.
[00:25:57.002 --> 00:26:00.904]  There were probably at least a dozen family members
[00:26:02.526 --> 00:26:08.089]  Shouting out, and saying lies, and why don't you ask real questions, and what about the radios?
[00:26:08.169 --> 00:26:13.753]  And it was quite stunning, and in terms of the response of the Commission, they were flabbergasted.
[00:26:14.773 --> 00:26:30.363]  The net result was, at the end of the day, instead of holding a press conference, they issued, in block letters, a half-page statement saying that Chairman Kaine and Vice Chairman Hamilton will not be holding their press conference, and they will be issuing a joint statement.
[00:26:32.168 --> 00:26:53.370]  Then I saw Mr. Broder and others, because I did watch part of the commission hearing later on the internet on C-SPAN, we have that up on presentplanet.tv, but I mean I saw you guys all getting interviewed, then I didn't see much of it on the news, they would show you and then say this is what they said, oh they had a few questions, I mean no, this is a giant cover-up
[00:26:53.930 --> 00:26:56.092]  Let's bring Mr. Broder in here.
[00:26:56.752 --> 00:26:59.214]  Mr. Broder, I saw all those news cameras around you.
[00:26:59.514 --> 00:27:01.356]  Did anybody carry your statements?
[00:27:01.416 --> 00:27:11.243]  Because the Chicago Tribune and other papers just said, oh, there were a few questions, and then basically excised all the real statements that you and some of the victims had brought forward.
[00:27:11.583 --> 00:27:17.067]  Well, they got more press than I would have expected, because I'm used to them just burying the truth whenever possible.
[00:27:17.087 --> 00:27:20.269]  Well, they couldn't ignore it, though, because it went out on live television.
[00:27:20.589 --> 00:27:21.550]  The quote, 3,000 murdered, does not
[00:27:23.695 --> 00:27:23.995]  I don't
[00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:42.330]  I mean, it hasn't been brought up.
[00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.571]  Why did building 7 of steel buildings ever fell?
[00:27:44.772 --> 00:27:45.392]  3 knew that day.
[00:27:45.512 --> 00:27:47.313]  Building 7 isn't hit by an aircraft.
[00:27:48.434 --> 00:27:49.495]  Do you know the true story?
[00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:52.938]  No one has reported the true story about the emergency bunker.
[00:27:53.318 --> 00:27:59.762]  Mayor Giuliani moved it there to line the pockets of Larry Silverstein, who was his largest campaign contributor by sheer coincidence.
[00:28:00.283 --> 00:28:03.305]  And Larry Silverstein had two stories in that building.
[00:28:03.325 --> 00:28:05.146]  The 23rd floor and I think the 22nd floor.
[00:28:05.507 --> 00:28:07.988]  He could not rent them out for 8 years.
[00:28:08.068 --> 00:28:10.110]  He was losing millions of dollars in rent
[00:28:10.655 --> 00:28:18.959]  And his buddy, Rudy Giuliani, came to the rescue and took the Emergency Management Center, which was state-of-the-art, out of the basement of one police plaza.
[00:28:19.499 --> 00:28:24.941]  And he moved it from a city-owned building, where it was very safe, into the Twin Towers Complex.
[00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:27.022]  But, Mr. Broder, it's a lot bigger than that.
[00:28:27.102 --> 00:28:31.084]  The firefighters told the Associated Press, get back, we're about to bring down the building.
[00:28:31.384 --> 00:28:35.206]  And Silverstein got on a PBS documentary and said that they blew Building 7 up.
[00:28:35.246 --> 00:28:35.846]  Were you aware of that?
[00:28:36.686 --> 00:28:39.007]  Well, to me, it almost doesn't matter.
[00:28:39.067 --> 00:28:42.667]  Giuliani put the Emergency Management Center in there negligently.
[00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:44.027]  He did it for corrupt reasons.
[00:28:44.407 --> 00:28:47.008]  He now says it was a mistake, but it wasn't.
[00:28:47.368 --> 00:28:50.949]  It was a corrupt maneuver on Giuliani's part to line Silverstein's pocket.
[00:28:51.149 --> 00:28:55.129]  Well, if we can get Al Capone on something smaller than the big event, then that sounds good to me.
[00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:57.770]  But let's go back to Kyle, and then we're about to break.
[00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.310]  We'll come back and have more time here and just go over all these issues.
[00:29:00.990 --> 00:29:03.751]  But Kyle, were you aware of Building 7 and the pulling of the building?
[00:29:04.486 --> 00:29:04.886]  I did.
[00:29:04.946 --> 00:29:22.669]  I've listened to the quote of Silverstein on the NOVA, the PBS special, in which he says, you know, let's call it, we've had too much loss of life today, let's call it, which is a term that's used by professionals who conduct demolitions of buildings.
[00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:30.050]  So, it certainly raises the specter that, you know, the question, was this in fact rigged for demolition?
[00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:32.751]  Well, how did some small fires make a collapse?
[00:29:34.802 --> 00:29:43.790]  ...by a plane, and this is one of the big, big emerging questions that, quite frankly, you should know that some of the family members are beginning to ask.
[00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:44.711]  Good, good.
[00:29:44.731 --> 00:29:45.171]  Stay there.
[00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:49.134]  I want to talk about what the family members are saying, what happened in that commission meeting.
[00:29:49.294 --> 00:29:49.995]  You guys stay there.
[00:29:51.516 --> 00:29:52.437]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:54.519]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.539 --> 00:29:58.142]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.292 --> 00:30:07.577]  Maka is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:30:07.957 --> 00:30:12.020]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:19.746]  Only recently has science discovered that Maka is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:30:20.286 --> 00:30:27.634]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:30:27.994 --> 00:30:30.256]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:30:30.577 --> 00:30:33.840]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:37.383]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:30:37.684 --> 00:30:40.667]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:30:41.107 --> 00:30:43.950]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price

[00:31:01.883 --> 00:31:04.864]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:31:05.224 --> 00:31:14.047]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:31:14.367 --> 00:31:19.049]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:26.251]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:38.415]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:31:38.895 --> 00:31:43.358]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:31:43.518 --> 00:31:45.860]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:00.791 --> 00:32:06.313]  Old-timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:32:06.553 --> 00:32:12.115]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:32:12.356 --> 00:32:14.677]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:32:14.837 --> 00:32:15.877]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:32:16.037 --> 00:32:25.941]  Too bad the big seed companies became big green companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:32:26.241 --> 00:32:35.749]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:32:35.949 --> 00:32:45.096]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.

[00:33:16.303 --> 00:33:19.869]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Providence Road, Ireland.
[00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:21.591]  Pensacola, Florida.
[00:33:22.613 --> 00:33:23.935]  Los Angeles, California.
[00:33:23.975 --> 00:33:26.239]  Coming to you from Austin, Texas, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.208 --> 00:33:37.630]  Tom will be casting on Global Shortwave during the day at 9475 and at night from 9 to midnight at 3210 and the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:43.412]  We're fighting the globalists who are using terror to turn this into a prison planet.
[00:33:43.432 --> 00:33:50.013]  We are so honored to have Kyle Hens, co-founder of the 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to UnansweredQuestions.org joining us.
[00:33:50.774 --> 00:33:52.175]  Those amazing investigations.
[00:33:52.736 --> 00:33:53.737]  I'm very aware of his work.
[00:33:53.817 --> 00:34:04.427]  And Christopher Broder, who I just learned of a few days ago, when he boldly stood up, pointed his finger with power and purpose, and on the side of goodness, and told the truth!
[00:34:04.968 --> 00:34:06.089]  This is all facts!
[00:34:06.429 --> 00:34:09.652]  And America needs to stop being in denial.
[00:34:09.892 --> 00:34:18.358]  You're a conspiracy theorist, a crazy conspiracy theorist, to not say the government wasn't involved in this and didn't have prior knowledge at the bare minimum!
[00:34:18.718 --> 00:34:23.462]  He stood up and he told them three times, our government created and funded Al-Qaeda!
[00:34:24.643 --> 00:34:26.664]  They used them to attack the Serbs in 98!
[00:34:27.525 --> 00:34:29.066]  That's the Senate's own 99 report.
[00:34:29.818 --> 00:34:45.803]  Now, Kyle Hens, Christopher Broder, you guys, whatever you think is most important for people to know, that we need to discuss about this meeting, about the family starting to wake up, how this commission was appointed by Lord Bush, how it's a kangaroo court, it isn't being discussed.
[00:34:46.103 --> 00:34:47.944]  I mean, just, gentlemen, you've got the floor.
[00:34:48.304 --> 00:34:49.644]  Well, can I first make one point?
[00:34:49.744 --> 00:34:53.906]  If you notice, like the New York Times reporting now, if they're the left wing, then Lord help us.
[00:34:55.194 --> 00:35:03.316]  They spent more ink yesterday in the New York Times writing about what Rudy Giuliani was wearing during the hearing than about what was said by the families.
[00:35:04.196 --> 00:35:09.037]  And that should be a tip-off, again, that there was a lot of whitewash even by the media.
[00:35:09.057 --> 00:35:10.177]  They're all complicit.
[00:35:10.217 --> 00:35:11.937]  Bill Clinton helped protect these people.
[00:35:11.957 --> 00:35:17.078]  This has been a long-term, globalist plan being brought to fruition, and they're all intertwined.
[00:35:17.739 --> 00:35:24.660]  And I want to point out one other important point, because a lot of people, most of my friends are like, Bush is a maniac, and of course he's a maniac, but people don't realize Giuliani
[00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.291]  is old buddies with these guys.
[00:35:27.331 --> 00:35:29.692]  Number three in the Justice Department of Ronald Reagan.
[00:35:29.792 --> 00:35:31.893]  People think Rudy Giuliani is just some heroic mayor.
[00:35:32.273 --> 00:35:40.256]  Even some of my left-wing activist friends think Giuliani is this great man, and they don't realize all the scams he committed before 9-11, on 9-11.
[00:35:40.296 --> 00:35:45.718]  Look, look, look, I've got a whole file of mainstream news of all his mafia connections.
[00:35:45.758 --> 00:35:50.380]  Yeah, remember he tried to cancel the election after September 11th for a new mayor.
[00:35:50.993 --> 00:35:52.255]  He tried to violate term limits.
[00:35:52.535 --> 00:35:53.276]  People don't remember this.
[00:35:53.456 --> 00:35:59.825]  Rudy Giuliani created the Twin Powers Fund, ostensibly to raise money to give to the widows of firemen and the police.
[00:36:00.185 --> 00:36:01.868]  And he then tried to hold onto that money.
[00:36:02.358 --> 00:36:03.499]  And not give it out to them.
[00:36:03.519 --> 00:36:06.102]  He wanted to extend it for 20 years.
[00:36:06.442 --> 00:36:12.468]  And he was going to hire his girlfriend, Judy Nathan, and all of his other cronies at $200,000 a year salaries.
[00:36:12.708 --> 00:36:15.411]  And he was going to take the money that he raised for the war.
[00:36:15.431 --> 00:36:16.272]  Well, let me add this.
[00:36:16.472 --> 00:36:18.955]  And give it to his friends for 20 years.
[00:36:19.295 --> 00:36:22.298]  Eliot Spitzer, New York City's Attorney General, had to stop him.
[00:36:22.798 --> 00:36:25.801]  Well, on top of this, Eliot Spitzer something else.
[00:36:27.253 --> 00:36:36.235]  On top of all of this, they then told people, sign a form you won't sue, sign an agreement you won't talk about 9-11, then we'll give you this $1.5 million.
[00:36:36.436 --> 00:36:42.037]  They actually tried to use that money people gave as a way to muscle the victims.
[00:36:42.497 --> 00:36:43.657]  Yeah, well that was Giuliani's M.O.
[00:36:43.697 --> 00:36:48.699]  I mean, he gave hundreds of millions of our tax dollars to every media outlet, every media giant.
[00:36:48.739 --> 00:36:56.521]  Giuliani's had drinks with every media giant in New York City for eight years, and no one's ever going to find out the truth about some of the things Giuliani did.
[00:36:57.197 --> 00:37:00.758]  And that kind of troubles me, because Giuliani will be President of the United States in 2000.
[00:37:00.798 --> 00:37:03.278]  Well, I mean, I can only watch 20-30 minutes of it.
[00:37:03.999 --> 00:37:07.599]  I watched a little bit live, and then got ready for my own radio show.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.940]  But since then, I've watched more of it.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.060]  I mean, it's the whole thing.
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.701]  I've watched hours of it other days.
[00:37:12.781 --> 00:37:14.061]  It's a giant worship fest.
[00:37:14.101 --> 00:37:15.621]  We need a domestic CIA.
[00:37:15.921 --> 00:37:17.062]  The government did nothing wrong.
[00:37:17.122 --> 00:37:17.882]  We're your God.
[00:37:17.942 --> 00:37:18.742]  Give up your freedom.
[00:37:19.222 --> 00:37:22.304]  But let's go back to the families are starting to wake up.
[00:37:22.364 --> 00:37:27.127]  Christopher Broder, the man who stood up and really gave them a focused attack with the truth.
[00:37:27.628 --> 00:37:28.849]  What are the families starting to say?
[00:37:28.869 --> 00:37:32.651]  Because we heard that giant round of applause three times for you.
[00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:35.213]  Well, you should ask Kyle.
[00:37:35.473 --> 00:37:36.874]  Yeah, well, let me just jump in here.
[00:37:37.114 --> 00:37:40.516]  I mean, the families, you know, they're a diverse group.
[00:37:40.576 --> 00:37:42.137]  I mean, there's thousands of them.
[00:37:42.458 --> 00:37:44.339]  And so you have some diversity.
[00:37:44.359 --> 00:37:48.882]  But let me say that the general drift is they've absolutely had it with this commission.
[00:37:49.338 --> 00:37:49.799]  They don't.
[00:37:50.179 --> 00:37:51.361]  They're not putting faith in it.
[00:37:51.681 --> 00:37:52.843]  They're giving the benefit of the doubt.
[00:37:52.863 --> 00:37:54.986]  They're sort of waiting for the final report to come out.
[00:37:55.026 --> 00:37:59.191]  But they're already beginning to call for a truly independent commission.
[00:37:59.231 --> 00:38:01.214]  There's no question in my mind whatsoever
[00:38:01.653 --> 00:38:04.335]  That the White House exerts control over this commission.
[00:38:04.675 --> 00:38:10.779]  The executive director, who the family members of Zelikow, they've asked for his resignation.
[00:38:10.799 --> 00:38:13.220]  He's written a book with Condoleezza Rice!
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.581]  They appointed the commission!
[00:38:14.621 --> 00:38:17.003]  It's like this appointed governing council in Iraq!
[00:38:17.263 --> 00:38:18.143]  It's not elected!
[00:38:18.324 --> 00:38:20.105]  It's riddled with conflicts of interest.
[00:38:20.185 --> 00:38:21.646]  It's full of consummate insiders.
[00:38:21.886 --> 00:38:26.709]  By the way, Keene, the chairman, is in business with a Bin Laden family member.
[00:38:28.206 --> 00:38:29.828]  He's in business with Amrata Hez.
[00:38:29.868 --> 00:38:38.658]  He's the director of Amrata Hez, who was involved in some and had some interest in possible building some pipelines down through Afghanistan and bringing some oil to market.
[00:38:38.698 --> 00:38:41.841]  He's also in business with one of Bin Laden's brothers-in-law.
[00:38:42.502 --> 00:38:43.243]  Yes, right.
[00:38:43.263 --> 00:38:43.983]  That may well be.
[00:38:44.104 --> 00:38:48.028]  And anyway, I just want to say that in terms of warnings on the 10th that you had mentioned,
[00:38:48.522 --> 00:39:00.113]  I haven't seen it confirmed that the White House called Willie Brown, but I have confirmed directly with Mark Hosenball at Newsweek, he is standing by the story which ran twice in Newsweek, that top Pentagon brass
[00:39:00.532 --> 00:39:02.653]  They were warned not to fly on the 11th.
[00:39:02.733 --> 00:39:04.834]  They were warned on the evening of the 10th.
[00:39:05.035 --> 00:39:20.243]  That was MSNBC, but no, it's AP, San Francisco Chronicle, the White House called Mayor Willie Brown the night before and said, somebody from the White House, we know it's Rice, his buddy, on the Arts Commission, called and said, don't fly to New York, and he told the San Francisco Chronicle that.
[00:39:20.683 --> 00:39:23.445]  It wouldn't surprise me if in fact it proved out to be right.
[00:39:24.326 --> 00:39:29.429]  On PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, we have 9-11 sections, we have the mainstream articles.
[00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.472]  And I can tell you it also appeared in Newsweek and it ran twice.
[00:39:34.099 --> 00:39:37.180]  So it's not like, okay, they made a mistake and then they retracted it.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:42.142]  No, they ran the story of top Pentagon brass being warned the night before.
[00:39:42.362 --> 00:39:49.885]  Also, we have Salman Rushdie, Times of London, banned for the month of September from flying to New York by the FAA for, quote, his safety.
[00:39:50.325 --> 00:39:58.688]  Yes, and I have been getting calls, you know, because of the nature of my work, from people, you know, filling me in, giving me anecdotal, you know, relating to me stories.
[00:39:59.178 --> 00:40:09.681]  So I have unconfirmed reports that there were numerous airport closings across the country that night, the night of the 10th, and also military bases that went on high alert.
[00:40:10.342 --> 00:40:12.282]  And here's another tidbit that no one's heard.
[00:40:13.203 --> 00:40:23.446]  A former Navy commander that was working at a base in Portland, near Portland, Maine, called me to say that someone who is still in the Navy currently, a Navy commander,
[00:40:24.105 --> 00:40:28.746]  Went on a hiking trip on the 6th of September with three of his friends.
[00:40:28.766 --> 00:40:30.066]  They piled in the SUV.
[00:40:30.106 --> 00:40:31.946]  They went up north toward the Canadian border.
[00:40:31.966 --> 00:40:33.007]  They did their hiking.
[00:40:33.027 --> 00:40:34.867]  They got in their car to drive back.
[00:40:35.287 --> 00:40:36.407]  This is on the 9th.
[00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:38.567]  They're 60 miles inside the border.
[00:40:39.308 --> 00:40:45.129]  And they come across this concrete serpentine roadblock on the southbound lane of Route 95.
[00:40:45.229 --> 00:40:48.509]  Again, 60 miles inside the border from Canada in Maine.
[00:40:49.289 --> 00:40:51.370]  And there was an M-16 toting
[00:40:53.809 --> 00:41:09.988]  uh... military personnel with full battle gear on and then twelve INS agents uh... they looked in the window the guys went to pull for their military IDs without even showing them that the INS agents saw that they were obviously four white guys and waved them through
[00:41:10.652 --> 00:41:11.412]  Wave them through.
[00:41:11.472 --> 00:41:13.713]  So someone alerted someone in Maine.
[00:41:14.113 --> 00:41:15.493]  Well, sir, let me stop you.
[00:41:15.693 --> 00:41:19.454]  At least ten of the CEOs that worked in the Towers weren't there.
[00:41:19.514 --> 00:41:28.236]  They were there with Warren Buffett and others at an Air Force base in Nebraska where Bush then stopped that day for some secret meeting.
[00:41:29.677 --> 00:41:30.437]  Were you aware of that?
[00:41:31.237 --> 00:41:32.918]  I had heard about a meeting in a
[00:41:34.398 --> 00:41:35.700]  Moffett Air Force Base.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:36.841]  At an Air Force Base.
[00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:37.622]  Associated Press.
[00:41:37.643 --> 00:41:40.526]  Called by Warren Buffett, yes.
[00:41:40.566 --> 00:41:44.291]  They were all there at 7.30 in the morning, by the way, and then Bush flew in later that afternoon.
[00:41:44.311 --> 00:41:46.114]  And what do you make of that?
[00:41:47.532 --> 00:41:59.220]  Well, this is very, very serious information, and are you guys aware of Stanley Hilton, Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff, who's got hundreds of the victim's families, and he's deposed military officers who said that they were ordered to stand down?
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:07.105]  He said on this show that he had inside info that there was a drill on the morning of 9-11 by the CIA of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center Pentagon.
[00:42:07.405 --> 00:42:10.888]  We brought that forward on this show two weeks later to get out ahead of the story.
[00:42:11.548 --> 00:42:16.792]  The CIA goes, yeah, we were running a drill that morning, and that was in the Associated Press.
[00:42:17.912 --> 00:42:21.655]  I believe it was the National Reconnaissance Office that was running the drills.
[00:42:21.735 --> 00:42:23.197]  There were three separate drills.
[00:42:23.357 --> 00:42:26.019]  There was another drill five weeks before and another one two years before.
[00:42:26.179 --> 00:42:34.626]  And there was the NORAD, the NRO, was running an exercise, a war game, not a war game, excuse me, an errant commercial jet crashing into their building.
[00:42:34.646 --> 00:42:35.727]  That was a later cover story.
[00:42:35.787 --> 00:42:38.088]  No, the first AP article was what they were actually doing.
[00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:44.734]  And then the NORAD itself was running an exercise that involved to hijack planes and so they had planes in the air
[00:42:45.527 --> 00:42:47.808]  Well, that's because NORAD isn't full of traitors.
[00:42:47.828 --> 00:42:49.488]  They had to tell them, just stand down.
[00:42:49.529 --> 00:42:52.109]  We know Dick Cheney was in the bunker, in control.
[00:42:52.129 --> 00:42:53.610]  Oh, it's just a drill.
[00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:57.731]  Now, let's get more into the families in the commission.
[00:42:58.292 --> 00:42:58.632]  Kyle?
[00:42:58.892 --> 00:42:59.112]  Yes.
[00:42:59.792 --> 00:43:09.816]  I can confirm for you that, speaking at least with one family member who is quite well informed and in contact with many others, that
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:37.402]  He has serious questions now as a result of independent looking into this issue about what happened in Building 7, which there were some small fires, a couple of different floors, and you know, some, what, five hours, five and a half, six hours after the Twin Towers came down, Building 7 collapsed, and there's been no definitive explanation
[00:43:37.901 --> 00:43:40.443]  There's an attending investigation.
[00:43:40.483 --> 00:43:41.885]  This is a current issue, people.
[00:43:42.245 --> 00:43:58.639]  So you can put some pressure on the government on why it is and how it could be that that building came down, because NIST, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is right now, as we speak, funded for, to the tune of, I think, $16 million, something in that neighborhood.
[00:43:58.659 --> 00:44:01.101]  They're gonna create a giant whitewash report that'll let me know.
[00:44:01.121 --> 00:44:04.104]  Of course they are, but every time they meet, every time they meet Alex,
[00:44:05.221 --> 00:44:14.684]  in public, and they've opened up to some public scrutiny, is a chance to raise this issue in public, in front of the press, and make some noise.
[00:44:14.764 --> 00:44:23.746]  I'm not saying they're going to get to the bottom of it, but every time that they stick their head up, it's a chance for us to exercise our vigilance and be vigilant.
[00:44:23.806 --> 00:44:24.947]  I've got another question.
[00:44:24.987 --> 00:44:26.367]  How do you get into these meetings?
[00:44:27.259 --> 00:44:28.159]  It's open to the public.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.060]  But I know, but it fills up at a certain point.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.421]  You just get there early.
[00:44:31.861 --> 00:44:32.682]  You get there early.
[00:44:32.702 --> 00:44:33.142]  I left out.
[00:44:33.242 --> 00:44:43.307]  Usually Giuliani's people spot me and they make sure I'm not allowed into any room where he is because I've disrupted lots of his things before because he has a bad habit of lying and no one double checks any of his information.
[00:44:43.587 --> 00:44:45.209]  Can I digress for a moment here?
[00:44:45.249 --> 00:44:45.349]  Sure.
[00:44:45.690 --> 00:44:51.937]  What are we going to do to prevent... I'm kind of curious, because I'm assuming, like many people, that there's going to be some major terrorist act right before the election.
[00:44:51.957 --> 00:44:53.078]  The White House told U.S.
[00:44:53.118 --> 00:44:55.121]  News & World Report it is going to happen.
[00:44:55.161 --> 00:44:59.626]  They say the Capitol will be destroyed, number one, or there'll be massive attacks coast to coast.
[00:44:59.906 --> 00:45:01.188]  Who stands to gain from that?
[00:45:01.568 --> 00:45:02.650]  What can we do to stop that?
[00:45:03.536 --> 00:45:07.157]  We have to expose who's behind 9-11, and I'll just say it right on the air.
[00:45:07.477 --> 00:45:09.978]  The military-industrial complex carried the whole attack out.
[00:45:10.338 --> 00:45:12.478]  At least seven of the hijackers are still alive.
[00:45:12.779 --> 00:45:13.799]  The others were trained at U.S.
[00:45:13.859 --> 00:45:14.659]  military bases.
[00:45:14.679 --> 00:45:18.600]  They have their cars and homes and credit cards paid for by the FBI.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:24.182]  The government staged the Afghan war, flew 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders out in the middle of it.
[00:45:24.482 --> 00:45:25.482]  That was all staged.
[00:45:25.522 --> 00:45:32.604]  The CIA insider trading, the PNAC documents calling for terror attacks to be helpful to get us behind imperial mobilization.
[00:45:33.064 --> 00:45:38.285]  I mean, we've got to come right out with the facts that giving up our liberties doesn't make us safe.
[00:45:38.485 --> 00:45:39.045]  No, it doesn't.
[00:45:39.145 --> 00:45:45.927]  Alex, may I make a plug for a book that I think raises the questions in a way and builds the case in a very... Sure.
[00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:51.888]  I'd like to put a plug in for a book called The New Pearl Harbor by David Ray Griffin.
[00:45:51.908 --> 00:45:57.690]  This man is a top theologian, a systematic theologian, a professor for many, many years, decades.
[00:45:58.210 --> 00:45:59.090]  He's published 20 books.
[00:46:00.761 --> 00:46:05.124]  It's called, The New Pearl Harbor Disturbing Questions About the Bush Administration in 9-11.
[00:46:05.605 --> 00:46:11.790]  The foreword was written by Richard Falk, human rights lawyer and professor emeritus at Princeton University, who said, quote,
[00:46:15.569 --> 00:46:18.451]  Has this potential to become a force of history?
[00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:30.117]  Sir, did you know Andres von Bülow, the former German defense minister in the parliament, and the former technology minister, says that the government either had total prior knowledge or carried it out.
[00:46:30.397 --> 00:46:35.099]  Michael Meacher, the British environment minister, resigned and wrote an eight-page editorial saying this.
[00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:36.780]  Are you aware of all those people coming forward?
[00:46:37.757 --> 00:46:38.078]  Am I?
[00:46:38.158 --> 00:46:40.883]  Yes, I have read their work, absolutely.
[00:46:40.903 --> 00:46:49.056]  We've posted his whole article on 911citizenswatch.org where we've got a list of resources and some links.
[00:46:49.719 --> 00:46:55.705]  Most of our work has been focused on trying to expose the farce of this investigation and the conflict of interest.
[00:46:55.905 --> 00:46:57.006]  It isn't an investigation.
[00:46:57.046 --> 00:47:02.892]  It's there to find out who knows what so they can have Goon shut them up later and to make the general public think there has been an investigation.
[00:47:02.912 --> 00:47:03.772]  Well, I know one thing.
[00:47:03.812 --> 00:47:08.076]  They're trying to shut up Sabel Edmonds, the whistleblower who worked with the FBI shortly after 9-11.
[00:47:08.137 --> 00:47:09.598]  Yeah, you yelled that at him.
[00:47:09.618 --> 00:47:12.541]  You said, why, you know, why are you going after the whistleblowers?
[00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:14.912]  That's right, and they are going after the whistleblowers.
[00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:24.643]  Well, I yelled out, I yelled out, just I yelled out, arrest the whistleblowers, because they were intending to arrest me, and they were gonna get rid of anybody else who criticized the commission during the actual hearing.
[00:47:24.663 --> 00:47:26.625]  They have been threatening to arrest Edmonds.
[00:47:27.366 --> 00:47:28.868]  And so, that was my point.
[00:47:29.108 --> 00:47:30.389]  Wait, can you guys answer this question?
[00:47:30.409 --> 00:47:33.933]  Because I don't have all the answers, but I know so much dirt about what Giuliani did on 9-11.
[00:47:34.881 --> 00:47:39.244]  You know how they melted, he shipped off the steel, all the steel, well as much of the steel as he could.
[00:47:39.264 --> 00:47:43.428]  And the firefighters said that was destroying a crime scene, that was criminal, that a fire couldn't bring that down.
[00:47:43.668 --> 00:47:53.996]  And, so, do you guys think, I mean the steel was not only sent off and melted down, but Juliani's people said, we didn't know that people wanted to save the victims, families had to testify in front of Congress and FEMA.
[00:47:54.316 --> 00:47:59.260]  Well you don't destroy a crime scene, they rushed in, wouldn't let people take photos, pulled it all away.
[00:48:00.055 --> 00:48:04.256]  And do you think, though, that that's because there was something more than just fire in the Twin Towers?
[00:48:04.316 --> 00:48:05.036]  Oh, come on.
[00:48:05.176 --> 00:48:08.157]  I mean, the seismographs, the explosions going off down the sides.
[00:48:08.377 --> 00:48:11.098]  I've talked to the firefighters who saw the bombs going off.
[00:48:11.878 --> 00:48:12.138]  Wow.
[00:48:12.498 --> 00:48:19.120]  Yeah, there's a lot of anecdotal evidence that, you know, we don't have the smoking gun because we weren't able to take a swath.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:23.141]  We have the firefighters telling AP reporters, get back, we're about to bring down the building.
[00:48:23.921 --> 00:48:26.282]  That's building 7, but in case it's the towers,
[00:48:26.755 --> 00:48:27.655]  There's anecdotal evidence.
[00:48:27.675 --> 00:48:30.916]  There was a gentleman who was in Vietnam that worked with C-4.
[00:48:31.156 --> 00:48:37.958]  And he was running away from the buildings when they started to come down and he heard these explosions and saw white smokes.
[00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:43.300]  Yeah, there were white explosion points going off at every level where the floors are at.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.701]  Yeah, there's a lot of anecdotal stuff.
[00:48:45.861 --> 00:48:49.942]  And in fact, Citizens Watch held a press conference on March 22nd of this year
[00:48:50.618 --> 00:48:52.238]  It was covered live by C-SPAN.
[00:48:52.258 --> 00:48:53.479]  We raised some of these questions.
[00:48:53.519 --> 00:48:59.180]  We put out this book and showed the book to the press and so on.
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:13.643]  But at that conference, a gentleman named William Rodriguez, who spent 20 years sweeping the stairwell of one of the World Trade Center towers, and he said that he survived the attacks and was leading some of the firemen up the stairs.
[00:49:14.103 --> 00:49:18.924]  And when he reached the 32nd floor of, I can't remember if it was the North or South Tower,
[00:49:19.905 --> 00:49:22.567]  This entire floor has been locked off.
[00:49:22.627 --> 00:49:25.388]  He has the keys to all the doors in the building.
[00:49:25.968 --> 00:49:27.669]  He's like the custodian for the building.
[00:49:28.049 --> 00:49:30.010]  No one's in there.
[00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:35.413]  This is an empty floor and he heard all of these noises and stuff going on in that floor.
[00:49:35.874 --> 00:49:37.474]  Again, it's just another anomaly.
[00:49:37.734 --> 00:49:42.357]  He also evacuated the building for some drills a few days before and shut down some floors.
[00:49:42.944 --> 00:49:44.626]  William, I talked to William about that.
[00:49:44.666 --> 00:49:49.730]  He said, as a matter of course, three times a year they do shut down the electricity in parts of the building.
[00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:53.093]  It's a matter of standard... But it was in the mainstream news.
[00:49:53.133 --> 00:49:55.535]  There were all these weird people in there.
[00:49:57.157 --> 00:49:58.278]  Well, here's another.
[00:49:58.398 --> 00:49:59.499]  Again, this is unconfirmed.
[00:49:59.519 --> 00:50:01.000]  There's a lot of stuff that's confirmed.
[00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:04.243]  You can go to the 9-11 timeline at cooperativeresearch.org.
[00:50:04.663 --> 00:50:08.987]  See all of the mainstream press articles that account a lot of the things we're talking about here.
[00:50:09.443 --> 00:50:29.200]  But I grant you some of the stuff I'm talking about is unconfirmed, but there's another story that was related to me by an employee, a former employee of the United Nations, who has a friend who was a cop in the towers that said that at 7.30, very early in the morning, there was some kind of alarm or some kind of problem in one of the towers.
[00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:30.581]  No, no, that's been in the news, sir.
[00:50:30.621 --> 00:50:32.843]  You guys, there's just so much evidence, you've missed some of it.
[00:50:33.300 --> 00:50:34.100]  Yeah, I'm sure of it.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:35.661]  I'm sure I've missed all kinds of stuff.
[00:50:35.981 --> 00:50:45.925]  In this case, there was some firefighters that came in at 7.30 that morning, and a couple of them managed to get past these cops, but they looked somewhat suspicious.
[00:50:45.965 --> 00:50:47.865]  These two cops, three cops stopped them.
[00:50:48.245 --> 00:50:49.106]  They were questioned.
[00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:50.926]  There's probably a press report.
[00:50:50.986 --> 00:50:54.708]  I mean... Tell you what, gentlemen, both of you, Mr. Hens, Mr. Brothers, stay there.
[00:50:54.728 --> 00:50:56.568]  We're going to come back, get more into this.
[00:50:56.608 --> 00:50:57.409]  Maybe take a few calls.
[00:50:57.429 --> 00:50:57.769]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:03.301]  I think so.
[00:51:18.206 --> 00:51:18.866]  We're good to go!
[00:51:47.722 --> 00:51:50.825]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:51:50.985 --> 00:51:56.972]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:52:00.495 --> 00:52:04.820]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:09.384]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:52:12.532 --> 00:52:14.133]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:52:14.193 --> 00:52:15.394]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:52:30.703 --> 00:52:41.246]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:52:41.466 --> 00:52:46.827]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:52:47.327 --> 00:52:51.248]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:52:51.268 --> 00:52:51.708]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:51.728 --> 00:52:53.529]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:06.151]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:53:06.291 --> 00:53:12.452]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:53:12.732 --> 00:53:21.174]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:53:21.414 --> 00:53:28.435]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:53:28.755 --> 00:53:33.558]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:53:33.778 --> 00:53:39.182]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:53:39.522 --> 00:53:42.604]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:53:42.945 --> 00:53:50.910]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:51.530]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:54:07.924 --> 00:54:11.608]  Alright, I want to keep our guests within five minutes into the next hour.
[00:54:11.628 --> 00:54:13.170]  Then we've got another guest coming up.
[00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.691]  Very serious issue.
[00:54:14.711 --> 00:54:19.616]  I'm going to try to go to Mike in Washington and a few others for our guests.
[00:54:19.636 --> 00:54:21.298]  A bunch of callers called in on other issues.
[00:54:21.338 --> 00:54:22.399]  We can't go to you right now.
[00:54:23.682 --> 00:54:25.643]  But we'll go to Mike in Washington here in just a second.
[00:54:25.663 --> 00:54:33.266]  Before we go back to our guests, and we'll obviously have to have them back up again in the future, and then we're having some of the widows, trying to get some of the widows on next week, and others.
[00:54:34.086 --> 00:54:35.386]  But this is very serious.
[00:54:35.426 --> 00:54:44.269]  We need good people standing up saying, no, we're not buying your fraud, we're not buying your whitewash, we're not going to have, you know, Herman Goering investigating Hitler here.
[00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.650]  This is a fraud.
[00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:51.572]  And if you want to help expose the fraud, get my video, 9-11 the Road to Tyranny, two and a half hours long.
[00:54:52.782 --> 00:54:54.423]  Well, the DVD's almost three hours long.
[00:54:54.864 --> 00:54:58.927]  Detailing the history of government-sponsored terror and what really happened on September 11th.
[00:54:59.247 --> 00:54:59.867]  The facts.
[00:54:59.967 --> 00:55:01.809]  Almost everyone that watches this wakes up.
[00:55:02.149 --> 00:55:04.771]  You're authorized to make copies of my videos, okay?
[00:55:05.171 --> 00:55:06.973]  I just want you to get 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:06.993 --> 00:55:07.993]  Get Part 2 of that.
[00:55:08.274 --> 00:55:11.356]  The Masters of Terror goes into 9-11 with all the other evidence.
[00:55:11.856 --> 00:55:23.080]  It took two videos to tell this story, and I wrote a book, 9-11 Dissent and Tyranny, 220 pages on the subject, and Paul Watson's book that I published, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order.
[00:55:23.561 --> 00:55:25.461]  It's also a great book, over 300 pages.
[00:55:25.821 --> 00:55:34.885]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order the videos via our secure, safe shopping cart of the books, or call toll free.
[00:55:35.826 --> 00:55:36.047]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:36.067 --> 00:55:36.447]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:36.527 --> 00:55:40.290]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[00:55:40.671 --> 00:55:48.998]  Help us expose who was really behind this, or the globalists are going to continue to carry out more terror attacks to scare us into submission in this war for global empire.
[00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:08.754]  The future of this country and your family depends on the truth getting out, and I hope you'll follow these people around everywhere they go in your city or town.
[00:56:09.254 --> 00:56:10.875]  Confront everybody about this.
[00:56:10.915 --> 00:56:12.216]  This is the number one issue.
[00:56:12.836 --> 00:56:15.838]  Exposing who carried out 9-11 and who stands to gain from it.
[00:56:16.158 --> 00:56:24.563]  Going back to Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch, and of course Christopher Broder, who stood up and eloquently exposed these liars.
[00:56:25.383 --> 00:56:31.507]  Gentlemen, I want to break, come back in a final segment with you and take a few calls, but right now, any other key information you want to cover?
[00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:35.458]  Well, I'd focus more on the problems here in New York City.
[00:56:36.579 --> 00:56:38.181]  I should get a copy of your video.
[00:56:38.621 --> 00:56:39.302]  It sounds great.
[00:56:39.802 --> 00:56:49.810]  All I know is that here in New York City, I kind of focus on the Giuliani cover-ups, because the Bush thing is a little too big for me, and it sounds like you're kind of covering that.
[00:56:52.065 --> 00:56:56.848]  The scandals by Giuliani are endless, but I'm not sure that you're that interested in Giuliani.
[00:56:56.868 --> 00:56:57.468]  No, it's important.
[00:56:57.488 --> 00:56:59.309]  He's kind of a minor character right now.
[00:56:59.329 --> 00:57:01.791]  Well, he's an important minion, though, and that's why they worship him.
[00:57:01.811 --> 00:57:04.032]  Kyle, any other key points?
[00:57:04.352 --> 00:57:15.359]  I just want to say that I felt that yesterday, two days ago, when so many people spoke out, and it was sort of shattered, it shattered the facade of this commission.
[00:57:15.419 --> 00:57:21.563]  Whatever credibility that it might have had with a lot of the family members or those who were watching, it just, it was like the ice was
[00:57:23.449 --> 00:57:27.573]  It's like the four-year-old going to the emperor's neck and he has no clothes.
[00:57:40.174 --> 00:57:42.877]  The things that go on in the shadows in this government.
[00:57:43.177 --> 00:57:49.163]  Until we shift the money... And that's what Homeland Security is all about, is feeding the whole economy through the people in government.
[00:57:49.183 --> 00:57:49.643]  Of course it is.
[00:57:49.683 --> 00:58:01.234]  And until we bring control and autonomy back to our communities, our neighborhoods, our regions, and keep the money at home so that it doesn't get sucked out by the Walmarts of the world,
[00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:03.660]  We're not going to have control over our lives.
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.761]  It's got to begin in our backyards.
[00:58:05.821 --> 00:58:06.202]  That's right.
[00:58:06.242 --> 00:58:10.565]  The power is locally, not the skull and bones election between Kerry and Bush.
[00:58:11.506 --> 00:58:12.867]  Listen, there's no question about it.
[00:58:12.927 --> 00:58:16.910]  Until we get control of the money, the power will reside outside.
[00:58:16.991 --> 00:58:18.832]  There's increasing centralization.
[00:58:18.892 --> 00:58:21.014]  I just want to look at the big picture for just a heartbeat here.
[00:58:21.414 --> 00:58:23.035]  There's centralization going on.
[00:58:23.116 --> 00:58:23.936]  You're well aware of it.
[00:58:23.976 --> 00:58:24.357]  I know that.
[00:58:24.377 --> 00:58:25.377]  I'm sure your listeners are.
[00:58:25.658 --> 00:58:29.681]  But we've got to figure out positive steps that citizenry can take.
[00:58:30.162 --> 00:58:33.426]  In terms of vigilance and calling for transparency and accountability, yes.
[00:58:33.726 --> 00:58:36.229]  But we've got to vote with our pocketbooks.
[00:58:36.589 --> 00:58:44.919]  Vote with the dollar and shift out of investing in the places that created the problems we're facing and into... Incredible!
[00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:45.500]  Incredible!
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.180]  We've got to break.
[00:58:46.221 --> 00:58:47.382]  Gentlemen, stay right there.
[00:58:47.402 --> 00:58:48.243]  Stay with us.
[00:58:48.263 --> 00:58:49.144]  We'll be back in one minute.
[00:58:51.661 --> 00:58:55.143]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:58:55.403 --> 00:58:58.904]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:59.004 --> 00:59:02.926]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:09.329]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.729 --> 00:59:17.633]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:18.053 --> 00:59:23.399]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:59:23.559 --> 00:59:27.322]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.683 --> 00:59:29.545]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclainable.
[00:59:29.605 --> 00:59:31.787]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:32.027 --> 00:59:36.612]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:59:36.652 --> 00:59:41.116]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-422-9000.
[00:59:41.937 --> 00:59:45.460]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:49.783]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:59:57.869 --> 00:59:58.530]  Big Brother.
[00:59:59.170 --> 01:00:00.251]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.952 --> 01:00:02.152]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.713 --> 01:00:03.554]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.274 --> 01:00:05.055]  Well so does he.
[01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:09.783]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.004 --> 01:00:14.127]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.808 --> 01:00:18.451]  Defending liberty, resisting tyranny.
[01:00:18.631 --> 01:00:22.014]  We're now into our number two for stations that just joined us.
[01:00:22.654 --> 01:00:28.259]  We've been talking to Christopher Broder, the man who stood up and said, our government created and funded Al-Qaeda.
[01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:32.922]  Building 7, cover up, stop trying to arrest the whistleblowers.
[01:00:32.962 --> 01:00:40.006]  We also have another man who was there, Kyle Hens, co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch, contributor to unansweredquestions.org.
[01:00:40.807 --> 01:00:43.308]  And I want to try to make a few calls here for you gentlemen.
[01:00:44.229 --> 01:00:45.390]  And they're absolutely right.
[01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:53.295]  This is the emperor has no clothes, breaking the ice, piercing the veil, letting the light in, the vampires scurrying away.
[01:00:53.915 --> 01:00:55.737]  This commission was appointed by Bush.
[01:00:55.777 --> 01:01:00.720]  It's like Janet Reno appointing Senator Danforth to investigate Waco, calling it independent.
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:01.961]  This is a joke.
[01:01:02.101 --> 01:01:03.142]  This is a fraud.
[01:01:03.402 --> 01:01:09.926]  This is the number one issue to expose this military-industrial complex and how they're carrying out the attacks and scares in this mission.
[01:01:10.226 --> 01:01:11.707]  Let's talk to Mike in Washington.
[01:01:11.767 --> 01:01:14.089]  Mike, you're on the air with Christopher Broder and Kyle Hens.
[01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.570]  Good morning.
[01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:16.570]  Hello, Mike.
[01:01:16.610 --> 01:01:17.051]  Go ahead.
[01:01:17.351 --> 01:01:18.211]  Hello, Kyle.
[01:01:18.291 --> 01:01:26.916]  Christopher, I would like to commend you personally for the testicular fortitude you had to stand up to those thugs yesterday, or the other day.
[01:01:26.936 --> 01:01:30.698]  I heard the tape and, I don't know, it just, it really moved me.
[01:01:30.738 --> 01:01:32.539]  I think what you did is a domino effect.
[01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:39.447]  And it's going to start something that will create, every time these creatures get up and lie to us, it'll create something for everyone else to have the opportunity.
[01:01:39.467 --> 01:01:43.030]  Well, Ashcroft was in Detroit a few months ago and people stood up and said the same thing.
[01:01:43.050 --> 01:01:44.170]  It's happening more and more.
[01:01:44.551 --> 01:01:47.373]  Usually the media covers it up because this was live on TV.
[01:01:47.673 --> 01:01:48.414]  Millions saw it.
[01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:49.415]  They had to try to spin it.
[01:01:49.635 --> 01:01:50.436]  Gentlemen, comments?
[01:01:51.196 --> 01:01:53.117]  Uh, well, uh, thanks, I guess.
[01:01:53.357 --> 01:01:55.918]  I don't think... I mean, I didn't go there to raise hell.
[01:01:55.978 --> 01:01:59.579]  I went there to be quiet, but what I saw was the most horrendous thing I've ever witnessed.
[01:01:59.619 --> 01:02:01.240]  The biggest whitewash I've ever seen.
[01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.980]  A warship session.
[01:02:03.181 --> 01:02:06.182]  But I think more Americans have to stand up to their government.
[01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:07.742]  The media is not going to do it for us.
[01:02:07.782 --> 01:02:09.203]  People think there's checks and balances.
[01:02:09.243 --> 01:02:11.023]  There are no checks and balances in the system.
[01:02:11.163 --> 01:02:13.244]  The military-industrial complex owns the media.
[01:02:13.524 --> 01:02:17.906]  Yes, and so what I do is I try to encourage all my fellow citizens to, one,
[01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:22.465]  Never believe anything you read in the papers and be able to read between the lines.
[01:02:23.145 --> 01:02:29.411]  And, I mean, when Giuliani was mayor, he had me arrested repeatedly because I would go all over the city and expose some of his scandals.
[01:02:29.752 --> 01:02:32.474]  And, I mean, more people simply have to stand up.
[01:02:32.694 --> 01:02:38.220]  I lucked out that I didn't get arrested because... Yeah, there's more of us than there are of them, and if good people stand up, evil will fail.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:40.061]  But when we do nothing, evil triumphs.
[01:02:40.562 --> 01:02:41.563]  Uh, Kyle, any comments?
[01:02:42.398 --> 01:02:43.739]  I am in agreement.
[01:02:43.759 --> 01:02:47.001]  It's our responsibility to stand up and speak out.
[01:02:47.362 --> 01:02:55.087]  Without vigilance, without transparency, there is no way that we have any chance of realizing the ideals of our founding fathers.
[01:02:55.107 --> 01:02:56.989]  And they're telling us, give up liberty for security.
[01:02:57.009 --> 01:02:59.691]  When you give up liberty, you get slavery and tyranny and despotism.
[01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.972]  Anything else, Mike in Washington?
[01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:06.376]  Yeah, I'm just really fed up with getting unquestioned answers from this panel.
[01:03:07.316 --> 01:03:08.477]  Or unanswered questions.
[01:03:08.497 --> 01:03:09.398]  No, unquestioned answers.
[01:03:11.641 --> 01:03:13.644]  You don't have stuff that we don't even want to know!
[01:03:14.205 --> 01:03:27.042]  Well, it's just, oh, we're good, we need to give all our free- the CIA needs to run your life, oh, you're such a good- no one in government did anything wrong, and then they have these secret meetings with whistleblowers, and then tell Ashcroft what they said, and Ashcroft goes and threatens to arrest them!
[01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:35.798]  Exactly, and it's just time that everyone stands up and we wake up everyone to the fact of what's going on and stop this tyranny before it gets worse.
[01:03:35.958 --> 01:03:37.159]  Okay, thanks for the call, Mike.
[01:03:37.279 --> 01:03:38.380]  We don't have any time for other callers.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.124]  We'll get to others later with the next guest, but I do want to bring up this last question to you guys.
[01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:46.268]  Are they going to have more of these whitewash meetings, or is this going to stop them?
[01:03:46.798 --> 01:03:52.745]  There is, and I just want to correct for the record, I was actually co-founder of UnansweredQuestions.org, not just a contributor.
[01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:57.450]  You actually had me on just right after the conference that we did when we launched in June of 2002.
[01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:00.133]  There is a planned hearing scheduled currently for June 8th and 9th.
[01:04:04.602 --> 01:04:05.822]  In Washington, D.C.
[01:04:06.263 --> 01:04:13.405]  They may move that back a week, but that could be the most important hearing today.
[01:04:13.425 --> 01:04:13.785]  You know what?
[01:04:13.865 --> 01:04:23.229]  I think we need a demonstration in Washington against this commission while you guys are getting inside to confront them.
[01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:24.409]  I believe that that's the case.
[01:04:24.429 --> 01:04:27.690]  It would be great to see people on the streets with signs raising the questions.
[01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:29.351]  Again, give folks that date.
[01:04:30.543 --> 01:04:32.885]  Now again, this is not carved in granite.
[01:04:32.905 --> 01:04:40.990]  You'll have to keep an eye on 9-11commission.gov for the change of date if there is one, but it's currently scheduled June 8th and 9th.
[01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.391]  This is the most important yet.
[01:04:42.631 --> 01:04:46.534]  They're supposed to focus on the NORAD and FAA questions.
[01:04:47.014 --> 01:04:48.795]  Gentlemen, gentlemen, God bless you both.
[01:04:49.075 --> 01:04:50.196]  We'll have you both back on.
[01:04:50.236 --> 01:04:50.696]  Take care.
[01:04:50.876 --> 01:04:51.257]  Thank you.
[01:04:51.357 --> 01:04:51.717]  Thank you.
[01:04:53.197 --> 01:04:54.719]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.899 --> 01:04:57.982]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:04:58.122 --> 01:05:02.026]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:05:02.066 --> 01:05:06.290]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:10.434]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:05:10.554 --> 01:05:12.496]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:05:12.576 --> 01:05:15.900]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:17.001]  The medical bills!
[01:05:18.602 --> 01:05:20.623]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:05:20.763 --> 01:05:23.804]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:05:23.984 --> 01:05:26.886]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:05:27.346 --> 01:05:33.469]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:05:33.989 --> 01:05:37.794]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:05:52.739 --> 01:05:54.339]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:54.479 --> 01:05:58.600]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:01.601]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:06:01.681 --> 01:06:08.402]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:06:08.582 --> 01:06:11.583]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:06:11.783 --> 01:06:14.183]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:06:14.303 --> 01:06:19.004]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:06:19.204 --> 01:06:33.794]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum aren't extracted.

[01:06:52.443 --> 01:06:54.784]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:58.865]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:06:59.205 --> 01:07:00.006]  Read the labels.
[01:07:00.446 --> 01:07:04.567]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:08.969]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:14.231]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:07:14.611 --> 01:07:18.213]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:07:18.374 --> 01:07:23.717]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:07:23.997 --> 01:07:26.739]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:07:27.019 --> 01:07:27.940]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:07:57.961 --> 01:07:58.621]  Big Brother.
[01:07:59.282 --> 01:08:00.342]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:01.043 --> 01:08:02.164]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.804 --> 01:08:03.605]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.385 --> 01:08:05.166]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.922 --> 01:08:09.843]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.103 --> 01:08:14.225]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:17.406 --> 01:08:21.687]  Blasting out coast to coast from a growing number of wonderful AM and FM affiliates.
[01:08:22.928 --> 01:08:25.429]  Some will cast him on a little shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 central.
[01:08:25.449 --> 01:08:26.109]  At 9475 WWCR, the Global
[01:08:30.222 --> 01:08:30.842]  Hello, Torch.
[01:08:31.402 --> 01:08:32.903]  At night from 9 to midnight central, 3210.
[01:08:32.943 --> 01:08:38.184]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:08:39.925 --> 01:08:49.647]  I remember about a year and a half ago, a private Gruckheimer bragged in the Ithaca Journal in New York that they were ordered to go into villages and kill every man, woman, child, baby.
[01:08:49.908 --> 01:08:54.909]  He was quoted, and the Pentagon clarified and said, well, yes, in some areas with hostiles, we kill everyone.
[01:08:56.078 --> 01:08:58.159]  So their clarification was just as bad.
[01:08:59.079 --> 01:09:00.719]  This was a confirmed statement.
[01:09:01.539 --> 01:09:09.902]  We have the images of them beating people to death in these bases, under orders by the way, but they're just imprisoning a few people who followed orders, and that doesn't absolve them.
[01:09:11.402 --> 01:09:18.904]  We played the audio off PBS where they find guys stealing three sticks of wood, so they run over their car with a tank, and then laugh at them.
[01:09:20.763 --> 01:09:26.228]  We have Marine Corps chants now that have been in the news about how the children gather around, mow them little bastards down.
[01:09:26.248 --> 01:09:27.909]  I mean, what happened to us?
[01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:30.171]  I thought Saddam was bad because he tortured.
[01:09:30.992 --> 01:09:32.994]  But it's bad when he does it, it's good when we do it.
[01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:36.757]  Very, very painful to see this happening.
[01:09:36.777 --> 01:09:40.641]  And now new abuse photos of the beating people to death are coming out.
[01:09:40.681 --> 01:09:42.442]  And people smiling over dead bodies.
[01:09:44.384 --> 01:09:45.245]  This is incredible.
[01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:45.785]  What happened?
[01:09:45.805 --> 01:09:47.707]  I mean, I remember talking to old World War II vets
[01:09:48.618 --> 01:09:53.502]  When I'd be deer hunting around the campfire as a young man, and you couldn't get them to talk about World War II.
[01:09:53.522 --> 01:09:57.684]  And they were fighting a real enemy that was trying to kill them, not people they grabbed at a checkpoint.
[01:09:58.325 --> 01:10:00.086]  And, you know, they killed a lot of people.
[01:10:00.527 --> 01:10:01.787]  And you couldn't get them to talk about it.
[01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:04.830]  Or if you did, they'd start, you know, getting teary-eyed.
[01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:08.892]  You know, talking about having to kill a 14-year-old that was shooting at them.
[01:10:09.713 --> 01:10:16.598]  But so what happened to us with this video game culture where we have this killer instinct that just
[01:10:17.555 --> 01:10:21.256]  It's amazing, but more and more people in the military are going public.
[01:10:21.996 --> 01:10:25.838]  Last year and a half ago, four Delta Force members came back and killed their wives.
[01:10:25.878 --> 01:10:27.238]  I mean, what's going on?
[01:10:28.258 --> 01:10:36.981]  The Sacramento Bee had an article a few days ago, Atrocities in Iraq, I Killed Innocent People for Our Government, by Paul Rockwell, special with the Sacramento Bee.
[01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.991]  And this came out on the 16th.
[01:10:39.051 --> 01:10:40.071]  It's now the 21st.
[01:10:40.812 --> 01:10:53.299]  And we are joined by this former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the world, quote, I killed innocent people for our government.
[01:10:53.339 --> 01:11:01.904]  We appreciate his incredible courage to break his conditioning and to come forward with this.
[01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:05.426]  And Sergeant Massey, it's an honor to have you on the broadcast.
[01:11:05.947 --> 01:11:06.247]  Thank you.
[01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:13.881]  Tell us a little bit about yourself and basically what you went over in the Sacramento Bee and some of the things that they didn't cover.
[01:11:14.622 --> 01:11:17.364]  Yeah, I'll give you a little bit of background and history about myself.
[01:11:18.365 --> 01:11:20.106]  I graduated from Pearland High School.
[01:11:22.447 --> 01:11:25.910]  From Pearland High School, I... Pearland, Texas, I'm sorry.
[01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:28.732]  From Pearland, Texas, I... And that's down in Houston.
[01:11:29.372 --> 01:11:30.913]  Yeah, on the outskirts near the coast.
[01:11:33.475 --> 01:11:34.636]  Near Friends, Witt, and Gallup.
[01:11:35.156 --> 01:11:36.137]  Okay, please continue.
[01:11:37.123 --> 01:11:42.987]  I went to community college for a little while and decided to drop out of community college.
[01:11:44.028 --> 01:11:48.211]  I decided to join the Marine Corps.
[01:11:48.271 --> 01:11:52.474]  Money was tight growing up in a middle class neighborhood.
[01:11:52.494 --> 01:11:54.555]  I couldn't afford to continue on to go to college.
[01:11:55.896 --> 01:11:58.098]  I had a couple of buddies of mine that went into the service.
[01:11:59.839 --> 01:12:03.982]  I had always had the Marines on the back burner growing up.
[01:12:05.214 --> 01:12:07.895]  As a kid, I always had a love for the military.
[01:12:09.675 --> 01:12:17.257]  At one time, I had requested to go to a military boys academy, but we couldn't afford it.
[01:12:17.977 --> 01:12:22.839]  So when the money ran out for college, I went ahead and decided to enlist.
[01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:27.460]  I went to boot camp around the 1992 time frame.
[01:12:29.861 --> 01:12:34.422]  I was originally signed with the Infantry, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines out in Twentynine Palms, California.
[01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:56.990]  I finished up my tour there, re-enlisted, and went on to become an infantry instructor at the Marine Corps Boot Camp, Parris Island, South Carolina, where I taught the recruits basic infantry skills, how to survive in combat, rappelling, gas chamber, and the crucible as well.
[01:12:57.931 --> 01:13:02.713]  When I finished up with my tour as an instructor at Parris Island,
[01:13:03.348 --> 01:13:05.049]  I volunteer to go on recruiting duty.
[01:13:07.529 --> 01:13:11.611]  Growing up in Texas, I had the best of both worlds.
[01:13:12.811 --> 01:13:17.533]  During the summertime, I would go up and visit my relatives in Western North Carolina.
[01:13:17.553 --> 01:13:20.594]  So I grew up in Texas and Western North Carolina.
[01:13:21.874 --> 01:13:29.897]  So when I reenlisted and volunteered to go on recruiting duty... Those are both very heavy Marine recruiting zones.
[01:13:29.977 --> 01:13:31.117]  Isn't Texas the biggest?
[01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:36.272]  Yes, Texas is the number one recruiting state for the Marine Corps.
[01:13:36.472 --> 01:13:37.032]  That is correct.
[01:13:38.613 --> 01:13:47.497]  Okay, well let's accelerate through then your training, the mindset, and your statement here of killing innocent people for the government.
[01:13:48.677 --> 01:13:49.378]  Sure, sure.
[01:13:49.978 --> 01:14:00.923]  Basically, what had happened was we had received so much intelligence reports, and these intelligence reports that we were receiving continuously through Iraq,
[01:14:03.682 --> 01:14:11.366]  Basically painted a picture of an enemy that was everywhere, and the enemy was in civilian clothes.
[01:14:11.486 --> 01:14:17.370]  Well I told you to fast forward, but let's go to the point where you rotate into Iraq, and then what happened there?
[01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:21.813]  Once we got into Iraq, basically we walked into the country.
[01:14:23.714 --> 01:14:26.195]  And what division, what group did you go in with?
[01:14:26.415 --> 01:14:28.897]  I was with the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, Cat 1.
[01:14:29.958 --> 01:14:32.740]  And we were stationed out of 29 Palms, California.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:38.463]  And I was part of RCT-7, which was LSA-7 in Kuwait.
[01:14:40.204 --> 01:14:49.489]  We crossed the DMZ about March 22nd time frame, and rapidly moved up towards Baghdad.
[01:14:51.130 --> 01:14:57.914]  I was in cities like Azu-Bayir, Anumania, Salman Pak, Karbala.
[01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:05.615]  But to fast forward to, let's give you an example of the civilian casualties.
[01:15:06.456 --> 01:15:14.962]  These intelligence reports that we were given basically led us to believe that the enemy was everywhere and we didn't know who the enemy was.
[01:15:16.003 --> 01:15:23.949]  Some of the examples of the intelligence reports were Iraqis using civilians or Iraqi military using civilians as human shields.
[01:15:24.789 --> 01:15:28.592]  They were loading down ambulances, buses,
[01:15:29.304 --> 01:15:32.107]  Uh, police vehicles, using them as suicide bombers.
[01:15:32.788 --> 01:15:46.683]  Uh, basically, and it's kind of funny because the same threats that we were receiving over there, the same intelligence reports, are basically the same intelligence reports that are flashed to, uh, Americans every day in this country.
[01:15:47.946 --> 01:15:57.711]  Well, I mean, I remember watching the Marines going to Baghdad, live TV, and every truck with people just driving with the machine gun, dead bodies falling down, burning dead children all over the place.
[01:15:57.751 --> 01:16:00.272]  So basically, they said, everybody's an enemy, attack, attack!
[01:16:00.572 --> 01:16:07.195]  That's pretty much it, and subsequently, we killed a lot of innocent civilians.
[01:16:07.675 --> 01:16:09.496]  Now, the numbers I've seen are from 15 to 50,000.
[01:16:10.156 --> 01:16:11.657]  No one really knows the true numbers.
[01:16:11.697 --> 01:16:12.377]  Where would you put it?
[01:16:13.638 --> 01:16:21.683]  Uh, I would say just with my, with my scout snipers, machine guns, and missile men, uh, just my platoon alone, uh, thirty plus.
[01:16:23.944 --> 01:16:26.125]  I can't speak for... Thirty people?
[01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:28.326]  Thirty plus civilians.
[01:16:29.167 --> 01:16:30.467]  Oh, not combatants.
[01:16:31.188 --> 01:16:31.948]  So how would this work?
[01:16:32.008 --> 01:16:34.670]  I mean, if a car's driving along, you just go ahead and open fire on it, or?
[01:16:35.450 --> 01:16:42.434]  Uh, well, we would fire a warning shot, and prior to us leaving, uh, we had actually made signs in Arabic that said, stop, halt,
[01:16:43.318 --> 01:16:45.159]  Um, you know, slow down.
[01:16:45.779 --> 01:16:47.120]  But, uh, they didn't work.
[01:16:48.181 --> 01:16:53.023]  And we would fire a warning shot at the, at the vehicle's, you know, driver.
[01:16:53.583 --> 01:16:56.905]  However, if he didn't heed the warning shot, then we would light him up.
[01:16:57.325 --> 01:17:06.810]  Sometimes in the car, there would be, uh, women, children, uh, old men, uh, and... What was it like when you'd go into the car and there'd be splattered children everywhere?
[01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:09.171]  Uh, it was pretty horrible.
[01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:10.352]  Uh, as a matter of fact,
[01:17:11.156 --> 01:17:13.777]  Uh, every night when I go to bed, I see it.
[01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:18.139]  You see those little children's guts all over the place?
[01:17:18.599 --> 01:17:18.980]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:19.880]  Their brains?
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:22.541]  I want the neocons to listen to this, though.
[01:17:22.561 --> 01:17:26.163]  I want them to know, because they can sit there in their easy chair and say, kill them all.
[01:17:26.203 --> 01:17:32.386]  You know, when some thugs killed four contractors on radio, they said, kill everybody in Fallujah.
[01:17:33.026 --> 01:17:36.347]  So I guess if somebody commits a murder in Houston, we kill the whole city.
[01:17:36.768 --> 01:17:36.988]  Right.
[01:17:37.568 --> 01:17:39.809]  Well, you know, I mean, if you want to get into a little graphic,
[01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:53.093]  You know, a .50 cal round from an M2 Browning machine gun, when it hits a 14 or 15 year old body, it basically separates their torso.
[01:17:54.133 --> 01:17:59.434]  And as you walk up on the scene, you see half of a torso.
[01:17:59.894 --> 01:18:03.535]  And then Marines running around and taking pictures.
[01:18:08.031 --> 01:18:15.914]  Well, I know that it was in the news that they'd see some women and just shoot them and say, well, you know, better dead than alive.
[01:18:15.934 --> 01:18:24.737]  And then there were reports... Well, the actual statement that was given by one of my Marines was, better them than us.
[01:18:25.566 --> 01:18:34.208]  Well, they were at a hotel, some Marines, and there were Reuters reporters, and they just killed some children, and the reporter said, you just killed children, and he said, good, I want to kill more!
[01:18:36.048 --> 01:18:37.688]  Yeah.
[01:18:38.388 --> 01:18:49.230]  Let me explain to you, and with me being a recruiter, let me tell you the overall goal of what the Marine Corps, you know, what the Marine Corps' job is.
[01:18:50.251 --> 01:18:52.471]  You know, the official Marine Corps is going to tell you
[01:18:52.972 --> 01:18:55.593]  That they're there to give a young man intangibles.
[01:18:56.213 --> 01:19:00.995]  Self-confidence, honor, courage, commitment, self-reliance, self-direction.
[01:19:01.075 --> 01:19:08.418]  All these intangibles that build this young man and makes him go out and be a productive member of society.
[01:19:08.898 --> 01:19:20.182]  However, what they don't explain is the reason that they were teaching these intangibles to these young men is in order for them to meet the enemy on the battlefield and destroy him.
[01:19:20.774 --> 01:19:23.296]  That is a Marine's main purpose in life.
[01:19:23.956 --> 01:19:25.237]  That is what he is trained to do.
[01:19:26.638 --> 01:19:28.860]  To eat his own guts and ask for more.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:29.660]  Yes, sir.
[01:19:30.441 --> 01:19:31.362]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:19:31.382 --> 01:19:36.946]  I want to talk about these chants that have been in the news of having school children gather around, mow them bastards down.
[01:19:36.966 --> 01:19:38.126]  Did you guys have those chants?
[01:19:38.987 --> 01:19:39.528]  Sure, sure.
[01:19:39.588 --> 01:19:44.231]  That's something that while we're singing cadence, while we're running,
[01:19:45.721 --> 01:19:47.204]  But I talked to family who were Marines.
[01:19:47.224 --> 01:19:50.089]  They said 20 years ago they didn't sing songs about killing children.
[01:19:50.289 --> 01:19:50.991]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:19:51.031 --> 01:19:51.572]  We'll come right back.
[01:19:53.715 --> 01:20:04.446]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.

[01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:15.597]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:20:15.857 --> 01:20:21.619]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[01:21:54.893 --> 01:21:56.674]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:21:57.154 --> 01:22:00.576]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:22:01.077 --> 01:22:01.717]  Let's update.
[01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:06.012]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:22:06.372 --> 01:22:10.074]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:22:10.774 --> 01:22:11.715]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:22:11.755 --> 01:22:14.056]  dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:15.496]  Today, the U.S.
[01:22:15.516 --> 01:22:17.737]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:22:18.158 --> 01:22:19.678]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:22:20.239 --> 01:22:22.240]  January of 2002, gold's spot was 283.
[01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:28.142]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:22:29.443 --> 01:22:30.183]  Gold is moving.
[01:22:30.443 --> 01:22:31.564]  Equities are treading water.
[01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:34.636]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:22:35.196 --> 01:22:36.557]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:22:36.997 --> 01:22:38.739]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:22:39.139 --> 01:22:41.100]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.

[01:23:01.613 --> 01:23:05.856]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:23:06.076 --> 01:23:13.121]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:23:13.502 --> 01:23:19.606]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:23:19.746 --> 01:23:20.967]  There are no side effects.
[01:23:21.307 --> 01:23:24.249]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:23:24.409 --> 01:23:26.431]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:23:26.731 --> 01:23:33.975]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:42.783]  Call today.
[01:23:42.843 --> 01:23:47.427]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:06.329 --> 01:24:12.664]  Alright, we're talking to former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey who has come out and told the world, quote, I killed innocent people for our government.
[01:24:14.895 --> 01:24:26.862]  Now, sir, before we get more into this and the brainwashing, because during the break I talked to you about this, how things have shifted from kill a commie for mommy to kill school children, death, death, death.
[01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:29.864]  I mean, occult brainwashing, and you said you agreed with that.
[01:24:30.384 --> 01:24:32.085]  Why have you decided to come forward?
[01:24:32.165 --> 01:24:34.186]  What was the tipping point?
[01:24:34.226 --> 01:24:36.227]  Was it just maturity that you've gotten older?
[01:24:36.247 --> 01:24:38.289]  Yeah, it was just maturity.
[01:24:44.085 --> 01:24:53.431]  I'll be honest with you, when I was on recruiting duty the last year that I was on there, I was really having a hard time then.
[01:24:54.531 --> 01:25:03.317]  I felt that what I was being asked to do was not a lie, but not all the truth.
[01:25:05.918 --> 01:25:07.960]  I was just having second thoughts about that.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:13.203]  But I felt that recruiting duty was something that was just a part of it.
[01:25:14.076 --> 01:25:15.896]  You know, a part in my career as a Marine.
[01:25:16.617 --> 01:25:32.041]  But when I got to Iraq, it was shortly after recruiting duty, there was an incident where we had just killed a bunch of civilians and one of the survivors had looked up at me and said, you know, why did you kill my brother?
[01:25:33.741 --> 01:25:34.941]  We didn't do anything to you.
[01:25:35.841 --> 01:25:38.522]  And that was it.
[01:25:39.122 --> 01:25:41.403]  You know, after he said that to me, I just,
[01:25:43.089 --> 01:25:45.731]  I made a conscious decision there.
[01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:54.155]  And the reason that I've been doing this is just to repair my soul.
[01:25:55.095 --> 01:26:03.719]  And that's why I've been speaking out against... Well, something's wrong when four Delta Force operators come home in the same unit and slaughter their wives.
[01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:05.520]  Oh, I definitely agree.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.001]  I mean, something's wrong.
[01:26:08.742 --> 01:26:10.983]  I know old soldiers are all dead now who had
[01:26:12.495 --> 01:26:24.953]  You know, Silver Stars and Congressional Medal of Honor, and people I know personally, and they wouldn't talk about it, and they were fighting real enemies, and if you got them to start talking they'd get a tear in their eye.
[01:26:25.595 --> 01:26:28.396]  I mean, and especially if they accidentally killed children.
[01:26:28.636 --> 01:26:32.058]  But now, I mean, a lot of these people, I hear them calling the shows, bragging about it.
[01:26:32.118 --> 01:26:43.402]  I mean, what type of psychopath, I mean, what's the training that, and you said that, yes, you know these cadences, have the little children gather around, toss the candy on the ground, mow the little bastards down.
[01:26:43.462 --> 01:26:46.183]  I mean, who comes up with this stuff?
[01:26:47.624 --> 01:26:53.026]  Well, it's the individual leaders within, you know, the unit.
[01:26:53.730 --> 01:27:01.133]  And the section leaders that are in charge of the Marine or Airmen or... I can't really speak for the other branches of the service.
[01:27:01.613 --> 01:27:04.514]  So I'll just refer to the Marine Corps.
[01:27:04.994 --> 01:27:22.101]  But it's up to the individual unit leaders that... Were other members of your unit, your group that you were with, the folks under you, I mean, when people were looking up holding their dead babies in their hands with their entrails spilling out all over and really looking at the reality of this, I mean, did others have a problem with this?
[01:27:24.343 --> 01:27:26.445]  Well, it's kind of like a code of honor.
[01:27:27.765 --> 01:27:29.706]  What happens overseas stays overseas.
[01:27:31.567 --> 01:27:45.095]  However, I couldn't go on living my life like that and living under that code.
[01:27:45.996 --> 01:27:51.959]  But when the gentleman looked up at me and said, you know, why did you kill my brother, that was it.
[01:27:55.174 --> 01:28:08.203]  I want people to get the image in their mind, because we've got such a soft general public that's never really experienced anything, any real hardships they don't understand, but what was it like when women were wailing and gnashing their teeth and howling with their dead babies?
[01:28:08.223 --> 01:28:12.786]  I mean, we've got the images of toddlers splattered all over the place, bodies burned out of the ground.
[01:28:12.806 --> 01:28:14.227]  I mean, what was that like?
[01:28:15.468 --> 01:28:18.470]  Well, I can tell you for me, it was horrible.
[01:28:18.951 --> 01:28:20.452]  I actually had a
[01:28:23.032 --> 01:28:30.258]  A child died in my arms while my corpsman was trying to resuscitate the child.
[01:28:30.858 --> 01:28:41.186]  And the reason that the child expired was because he was in and around an area that was getting bombed by our aircraft.
[01:28:42.127 --> 01:28:49.192]  And having the father sit there and explain how his family was doing nothing
[01:28:50.141 --> 01:28:52.963]  And all of a sudden, you know, a bomb just explodes next to him.
[01:28:54.244 --> 01:28:58.027]  And he's looking at me saying, you know, I never worked for Saddam.
[01:28:58.728 --> 01:29:00.810]  You know, I have no affiliation with Saddam.
[01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:07.575]  Well, on top of this, you know, people shoot some guns in the air at a wedding, and they kill 40 of them, and the government's basically laughing about this now.
[01:29:08.716 --> 01:29:09.877]  Oh, yeah.
[01:29:10.958 --> 01:29:12.099]  I didn't really get the gist.
[01:29:13.239 --> 01:29:16.342]  I was kind of torn until I got back to stateside.
[01:29:16.929 --> 01:29:20.211]  Because while we were over there, we never got any type of information.
[01:29:20.272 --> 01:29:25.816]  All we were given was just official intelligence reports.
[01:29:26.156 --> 01:29:28.398]  So we gathered our information off of that.
[01:29:30.879 --> 01:29:37.324]  So it wasn't until I came back stateside and I watched the show that CNN... Stay there, sir.
[01:29:37.524 --> 01:29:38.265]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:38.285 --> 01:29:39.706]  Appreciate you joining us.
[01:29:40.006 --> 01:29:40.727]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:29:43.797 --> 01:29:46.798]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.718 --> 01:29:50.479]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.680 --> 01:30:01.202]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.462 --> 01:30:12.385]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.645 --> 01:30:14.446]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.726 --> 01:30:18.048]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.388 --> 01:30:28.813]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:29.133 --> 01:30:29.634]  That's right!
[01:30:29.814 --> 01:30:36.921]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:37.221 --> 01:30:41.345]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:30:41.505 --> 01:30:45.589]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:55.361]  It's finally here!
[01:30:55.502 --> 01:30:56.482]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:56.682 --> 01:30:59.623]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:59.863 --> 01:31:03.305]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:03.525 --> 01:31:11.668]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:31:11.928 --> 01:31:15.670]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:31:15.870 --> 01:31:20.892]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:31:21.172 --> 01:31:25.677]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:31:25.877 --> 01:31:29.941]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:31:30.021 --> 01:31:37.169]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn!
[01:31:37.449 --> 01:31:42.931]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[01:31:54.355 --> 01:31:58.877]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[01:31:59.657 --> 01:32:04.379]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunelco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[01:32:05.111 --> 01:32:07.775]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.

[01:32:13.244 --> 01:32:17.792]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:22.764]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[01:32:23.224 --> 01:32:23.644]  It's easy!
[01:32:24.105 --> 01:32:28.068]  Many of Sunelco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[01:32:28.488 --> 01:32:38.756]  Sunelco has a 106-page Renewable Energy Planning Guide and Catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.
[01:32:39.096 --> 01:32:41.218]  It may just be the best investment you've ever made.

[01:32:58.637 --> 01:33:00.538]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:01.018 --> 01:33:03.860]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:08.142 --> 01:33:14.026]  If America was invited, I would be the first volunteer tomorrow.
[01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:26.247]  But when I read the corporate documents by PNAC, the President, the Vice President, before they were even elected, saying Saddam is a threat, he's a pretext to get the oil, to use Iraq as a military base.
[01:33:27.067 --> 01:33:30.409]  When I read them saying we need terror attacks to get the people behind this.
[01:33:31.609 --> 01:33:37.131]  When I then see Posse Comitatus being erased, urban warfare training all over the place.
[01:33:37.891 --> 01:33:44.754]  My cousin, now based here in Austin, has been with Special Forces for 18 years, merging the military and the police covertly.
[01:33:45.834 --> 01:33:46.957]  Out at Bergstrom Airport.
[01:33:47.899 --> 01:33:51.487]  When I hear we've got to give up our liberties now, that's killing America!
[01:33:53.104 --> 01:34:11.091]  And then to watch it live on Fox, they didn't even hide this, the tanks going in, the marines of the army going in, and buses and cars and taxis and just shooting vehicles, bodies falling out, every vehicle on the road, high noon, driving down the street, kill everybody, kill, kill, kill, kill!
[01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:12.812]  People said, well we're in a war!
[01:34:13.332 --> 01:34:17.374]  Folks, that's what the Nazis would do, they would go into a place and kill everybody!
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:18.600]  Okay?
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:19.781]  That's what the Russians would do!
[01:34:20.222 --> 01:34:21.583]  That's what the Vietnamese would do!
[01:34:21.763 --> 01:34:23.905]  Americans don't act like that!
[01:34:24.325 --> 01:34:27.467]  Americans don't have cadences about killing children!
[01:34:28.468 --> 01:34:28.688]  Okay?
[01:34:28.728 --> 01:34:29.489]  Do you understand?
[01:34:29.509 --> 01:34:43.040]  And this is... These people that don't have a conscience, who don't have the moral courage, and it takes incredible moral courage to admit something was wrong, people that don't have the moral courage of Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey,
[01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.921]  They're going to come back and be cops on your streets, people!
[01:34:47.481 --> 01:34:52.043]  And you better be concerned about this and the torture that's going on over there, that's going on in our prisons!
[01:34:53.104 --> 01:34:55.064]  And so that's why this is such a great concern.
[01:34:55.084 --> 01:34:57.445]  Now I know that we've had callers holdings at the start of the show.
[01:34:58.066 --> 01:34:59.506]  I never gave the phone number out today.
[01:35:00.086 --> 01:35:00.867]  Usually I take calls.
[01:35:00.907 --> 01:35:04.368]  We've had a lot of guests on the day and everybody's been holding forever and we'll get to you.
[01:35:05.488 --> 01:35:07.969]  But I hope it's for our guests.
[01:35:08.049 --> 01:35:08.870]  So that's coming up.
[01:35:12.066 --> 01:35:24.430]  Sergeant Massey, going back to just the video I saw of trucks and cars, and this was live on television, being machine-gunned, and some of them, tapes, they were just, you know, play tape.
[01:35:24.550 --> 01:35:25.371]  They were proud of it.
[01:35:27.331 --> 01:35:28.672]  You said you were in some other cities.
[01:35:28.712 --> 01:35:34.834]  Did you go into Baghdad or did you go into town in the first part of the invasion?
[01:35:35.214 --> 01:35:40.636]  Are you aware of the video we've all seen here of just shooting everything that moves?
[01:35:42.745 --> 01:35:45.227]  Yes, and that's what it was like.
[01:35:46.147 --> 01:35:46.848]  That's exactly.
[01:35:47.828 --> 01:35:53.692]  You know, when you saw the Israeli attack, what was that, two days ago?
[01:35:54.253 --> 01:35:55.914]  With a bomb, you know, landing in the middle?
[01:35:56.534 --> 01:35:58.435]  That was what it was like.
[01:36:00.276 --> 01:36:02.938]  So, you got a busy market, and just here comes a bomb.
[01:36:03.218 --> 01:36:03.679]  There you go.
[01:36:04.759 --> 01:36:05.120]  Now, look.
[01:36:06.972 --> 01:36:10.514]  The British haven't had as many problems because they're old empire hands.
[01:36:10.554 --> 01:36:12.515]  They know to be nice to people and things go better.
[01:36:12.835 --> 01:36:16.236]  A lot of Iraqis, at least when you were there, were happy when we first got there.
[01:36:16.536 --> 01:36:18.917]  Then it all shifted because, hey, you killed my brother.
[01:36:18.937 --> 01:36:21.439]  There you go.
[01:36:21.539 --> 01:36:22.439]  But not my words.
[01:36:22.479 --> 01:36:24.920]  If that's accurate, give it to us in your words.
[01:36:27.781 --> 01:36:28.702]  No, you're exactly right.
[01:36:28.962 --> 01:36:35.625]  I feel the Iraqis are just retaliating against the brutality.
[01:36:36.601 --> 01:36:41.363]  That they've witnessed from us.
[01:36:41.523 --> 01:36:51.288]  I know if one of my relatives was murdered indiscriminately by an invading force, I would want to take revenge.
[01:36:52.208 --> 01:36:54.949]  Especially if that person was just having a peaceful demonstration.
[01:36:56.010 --> 01:36:58.631]  And that actually happened at one of our checkpoints.
[01:36:59.591 --> 01:37:03.353]  We had lit up a demonstration that was going on.
[01:37:03.797 --> 01:37:06.019]  This was on the outskirts of Baghdad.
[01:37:06.099 --> 01:37:08.180]  Now, by lit up, you mean machine gun fire?
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:08.700]  Correct.
[01:37:09.141 --> 01:37:10.702]  50 cals and M-16s.
[01:37:11.862 --> 01:37:20.048]  And, okay, now there's been a hundred of these reports out where you've got peaceful people and then suddenly the troops open fire.
[01:37:20.208 --> 01:37:21.869]  How is that happening?
[01:37:23.090 --> 01:37:28.874]  Well, what topped it off with us is we heard a straight gunfire that came in that direction.
[01:37:31.076 --> 01:37:33.117]  When the straight gunfire went off,
[01:37:33.652 --> 01:37:36.613]  The Marines were nervous and they opened up.
[01:37:37.333 --> 01:37:39.153]  They didn't know which direction that it was coming from.
[01:37:39.593 --> 01:37:50.276]  However, it is very important for you to understand the psychological impact that these intelligence reports were, you know, that were being given to the troops.
[01:37:50.296 --> 01:37:53.677]  Well, let me stop you about these intelligence reports because it goes the same way with cops.
[01:37:54.097 --> 01:38:01.879]  I've been on a land rights demonstration with conservatives, libertarians, and we're all standing there in our three-piece suits
[01:38:02.851 --> 01:38:04.791]  And we'll hear the police radios.
[01:38:04.831 --> 01:38:05.492]  They're militia.
[01:38:05.872 --> 01:38:06.752]  They may be terrorists.
[01:38:06.832 --> 01:38:08.132]  The Republic of Texas, you know.
[01:38:08.552 --> 01:38:14.413]  Using these... I mean, I see police being manipulated by the same type of departmental propaganda.
[01:38:14.553 --> 01:38:15.273]  Is that where you're going?
[01:38:15.753 --> 01:38:16.173]  Exactly.
[01:38:17.054 --> 01:38:18.314]  And that's what it is.
[01:38:18.414 --> 01:38:19.614]  It's just propaganda.
[01:38:19.994 --> 01:38:22.035]  Propaganda that's fueling a fire.
[01:38:22.695 --> 01:38:25.035]  Hell, they're even saying it on the TV.
[01:38:25.175 --> 01:38:28.236]  They were talking about it this morning on CNN.
[01:38:28.596 --> 01:38:30.056]  They were actually giving civilians
[01:38:31.575 --> 01:38:35.839]  Two years ago I saw a FEMA report in the Associated Press in New Jersey
[01:38:54.048 --> 01:39:01.314]  And they had all the town people there, and they said, pregnant women, don't trust them, priests, people that, you know, everybody's guilty.
[01:39:01.354 --> 01:39:02.355]  This is East Germany!
[01:39:02.755 --> 01:39:06.939]  Terrorists are hiding under every... It's just... Watch everyone!
[01:39:06.979 --> 01:39:07.639]  This is sick!
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:08.460]  Right.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.662]  It's no longer the Communists, now it's the terrorists.
[01:39:11.262 --> 01:39:12.583]  McCarthyism is alive.
[01:39:12.703 --> 01:39:14.465]  It's just extended into terrorists.
[01:39:16.457 --> 01:39:23.461]  Well, to use that term, they actually burned McCarthy when he found out the truth, that it wasn't the big banks behind the Communists, but in our own government.
[01:39:23.501 --> 01:39:28.083]  But you're right to say that, you know, to use that term and the common meaning.
[01:39:28.624 --> 01:39:32.546]  I mean, now they can't fire any terrorists, so they're using the Patriot Act just for average crimes.
[01:39:33.046 --> 01:39:33.366]  Correct.
[01:39:34.587 --> 01:39:40.130]  And I'll tell you right now, we violated the Geneva Convention.
[01:39:41.164 --> 01:39:56.337]  However, any, you know, however the President or Congress, however they want to manipulate the words of what the Geneva Convention says, I know that I was taught from day one that I went into the United States Marine Corps, you do not shoot civilians.
[01:39:57.418 --> 01:39:58.238]  And that's what we did.
[01:40:00.700 --> 01:40:06.325]  Have you been having the nightmares since you started talking or are you still having the images of the dead children?
[01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:13.853]  I've had them for a little over a year now, continuously.
[01:40:14.333 --> 01:40:16.555]  Some nights, you know, I may have a good week.
[01:40:16.615 --> 01:40:19.237]  I may go one to two nights where I won't dream.
[01:40:21.398 --> 01:40:21.899]  Where you won't?
[01:40:21.999 --> 01:40:23.139]  I'm sorry, your phone cut out.
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:31.646]  Yeah, I may go one to two nights where I won't dream about it, but then I'll go sometimes two or four nights where I will dream about it.
[01:40:32.306 --> 01:40:33.647]  Do you wake up in a cold sweat?
[01:40:34.007 --> 01:40:37.610]  Yes, and very easily startled.
[01:40:40.369 --> 01:40:51.805]  My fiancée knows not to touch me or if she's coming into the room and I'm there by myself she says that she's coming into the room so I don't get startled.
[01:40:54.489 --> 01:40:55.750]  That happens to a lot of people.
[01:40:57.523 --> 01:41:04.989]  My mom said when my uncle got back from Vietnam from tours with helicopters, the backfire went off and he jumped under the table.
[01:41:05.210 --> 01:41:08.092]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:41:08.112 --> 01:41:11.335]  I ran off the road the other day and there was a car that backfired next to me.
[01:41:12.476 --> 01:41:14.217]  Let me tell you, son, I almost ran off the road.
[01:41:15.538 --> 01:41:16.499]  Well, I mean, think about that.
[01:41:16.539 --> 01:41:18.381]  Now they're going to come back and be cops.
[01:41:19.416 --> 01:41:32.060]  And we've seen the reports of people that got back a year ago from Afghanistan, two years ago, they're on duty and they put three rounds in an old lady's chest as she sits at the wheel of her car because they saw the glint of metal on her purse.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:34.080]  Right.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:48.004]  And I mean, that's pretty much the number one occupation for, you know, Marine infantry, the Rangers or, you know, that's pretty much after you retire out of the military, you go to work for a civilian police force and
[01:41:48.752 --> 01:41:52.614]  Do your 20 years and that way you've got your state pension and you've got your government check.
[01:41:53.835 --> 01:41:57.016]  But you're just switching from one government organization to the other.
[01:41:57.957 --> 01:42:04.480]  I saw a statistic that 80% of the new recruits in the last five years have been out of the military.
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:05.241]  That's correct.
[01:42:05.441 --> 01:42:06.441]  Yeah.
[01:42:06.461 --> 01:42:14.345]  Matter of fact, when I got back to my hometown here in North Carolina, the sheriff contacted me and offered me a job.
[01:42:15.746 --> 01:42:16.727]  I told him no.
[01:42:19.670 --> 01:42:21.752]  Well, at least until you work through all this.
[01:42:22.172 --> 01:42:23.573]  Right.
[01:42:24.774 --> 01:42:27.276]  A lot of people, though, I mean, well, you were there.
[01:42:29.337 --> 01:42:30.378]  You know what, Stephanie?
[01:42:30.398 --> 01:42:32.700]  Do you have that PBS club we aired a month ago?
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.042]  Try to find that where they're running over the car for stealing the firewood.
[01:42:38.004 --> 01:42:38.424]  Have you?
[01:42:39.265 --> 01:42:40.045]  Well, you were there.
[01:42:41.126 --> 01:42:43.648]  Some people stole three sticks of firewood, they thought.
[01:42:44.218 --> 01:42:45.199]  I never saw that one.
[01:42:45.299 --> 01:42:47.641]  It wouldn't surprise me if that did happen.
[01:43:07.626 --> 01:43:12.949]  I'm going to put you on hold, Sergeant, and we're going to play this, and I want to get your response to this.
[01:43:13.009 --> 01:43:15.070]  Now, I want you to hear the laughing.
[01:43:15.110 --> 01:43:15.951]  This is very funny.
[01:43:16.051 --> 01:43:22.694]  Now, even if they were going to do this, there might be some excuse, but the laughing part, let's go ahead and play that.
[01:43:23.755 --> 01:43:26.096]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[01:43:29.638 --> 01:43:33.180]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[01:43:34.921 --> 01:43:36.222]  That child don't need to be in here.
[01:43:38.696 --> 01:43:45.358]  We filmed these G.I.s after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[01:43:46.898 --> 01:43:52.040]  We try to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take their car and we crush it.
[01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:53.480]  United States Army, tankers, hold.
[01:44:06.613 --> 01:44:07.754]  That's what you get when you loop.
[01:44:35.558 --> 01:44:39.262]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[01:44:40.042 --> 01:44:41.524]  The car was my livelihood.
[01:44:43.646 --> 01:44:45.127]  Sergeant, any comments to that?
[01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:48.511]  Man, I tell you what.
[01:44:50.312 --> 01:44:56.739]  I actually laid down on my couch here while I was listening to that and I was having flashbacks.
[01:44:59.041 --> 01:45:00.202]  That's a typical day, partner.
[01:45:03.203 --> 01:45:09.630]  A typical day, but that's, you know, the funny thing is the British don't want their people getting killed, so they're not doing any of this.
[01:45:09.650 --> 01:45:21.483]  They're not having 1-100 the problems, according to the reports, but our government's doing this, and I guarantee you when the UN comes in, they're going to stop this, and then they're going to be the good cop, and we're going to be the bad cop.
[01:45:21.503 --> 01:45:22.664]  This was all staged.
[01:45:23.064 --> 01:45:24.805]  I said this before the war even began.
[01:45:25.326 --> 01:45:32.290]  Israel is advising us how to bulldoze their date palms if somebody steals something or doesn't show respect.
[01:45:32.810 --> 01:45:34.512]  And this is meant to cause resistance.
[01:45:34.572 --> 01:45:36.012]  I think it's meant to widen all of this.
[01:45:36.433 --> 01:45:39.114]  And it's a sick joke on the Iraqi people and our own troops.
[01:45:41.536 --> 01:45:43.037]  I think you hit the nail right on the head.
[01:45:43.357 --> 01:45:44.038]  I totally agree.
[01:45:45.178 --> 01:45:47.680]  I believe this thing was pre-staged from the get-go.
[01:45:48.781 --> 01:45:50.662]  And I'll give you a little bit of evidence.
[01:45:51.571 --> 01:46:06.624]  1st Battalion, 7th Marines, 8 months prior to leaving to go to Kuwait, was secretly training up in San Francisco, north of San Francisco, learning how to shut down the Ramallah oil fields.
[01:46:08.505 --> 01:46:15.291]  I was part of RCT-7, and our primary mission at the beginning of the war was to shut down the Ramallah oil fields.
[01:46:15.851 --> 01:46:20.415]  However, why wouldn't Marines be learning how to shut down oil fields
[01:46:21.144 --> 01:46:23.726]  If we weren't scheduled to invade or attack.
[01:46:24.186 --> 01:46:28.109]  I'll tell you what the official word that was given to us because I asked the same question.
[01:46:28.789 --> 01:46:37.154]  They said, well, it's in case of future terrorist attacks in America to where the Marines have to be used kind of like an environmental protection.
[01:46:38.435 --> 01:46:40.436]  Now let me, let me shift here for a minute.
[01:46:40.576 --> 01:46:40.817]  Sure.
[01:46:41.337 --> 01:46:46.580]  I've got an Associated Press here, which is the biggest group of recruits now as illegal aliens and they make legal.
[01:46:48.946 --> 01:46:53.927]  I have been to the Urban Warfare Training Drills, where the Marines openly admit that it's for domestic insurgents.
[01:46:54.587 --> 01:46:56.988]  We know about the different surveys the Marines have been given.
[01:46:57.288 --> 01:47:01.729]  They're saying General Eberhardt, the head of NORTHCOM, said that we're going to have troops on the streets in America.
[01:47:02.229 --> 01:47:10.291]  The outgoing head of CENTCOM, Franks, December Cigar Aficionado, said that after the next attack we set aside the Constitution for a military government.
[01:47:12.091 --> 01:47:17.272]  A lot of this is joint training for here domestically, and I just want to get your response to that.
[01:47:20.069 --> 01:47:23.510]  So you're saying a possible violation of the Posse Comitatus Act?
[01:47:23.670 --> 01:47:29.312]  Well, yeah, we've had Senators call for getting rid of it, but since 1996, I've had JAG officers on it, but it's basically already gone.
[01:47:29.332 --> 01:47:31.832]  I mean, I've interviewed Marines who enlist.
[01:47:31.872 --> 01:47:33.133]  Well, let me tell you part of the ode.
[01:47:33.933 --> 01:47:42.935]  You know, it's to protect our country against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:45.416 --> 01:47:46.476]  Did I just answer your question?
[01:47:46.966 --> 01:47:52.354]  Well, they're able to use the Marines domestically because they're not under Posse Comitatus.
[01:47:52.775 --> 01:47:55.719]  Well, no, the Marines are under the Posse Comitatus.
[01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.141]  As a matter of fact,
[01:47:57.765 --> 01:48:00.306]  We have to train extensively in that.
[01:48:00.366 --> 01:48:03.667]  Well, they may tell you that, but we've had the JAG officers on who say that isn't so.
[01:48:03.887 --> 01:48:04.247]  Really?
[01:48:04.447 --> 01:48:04.707]  Okay.
[01:48:04.868 --> 01:48:06.328]  Maybe they're trying to claim that now.
[01:48:06.908 --> 01:48:07.128]  Right.
[01:48:07.428 --> 01:48:08.489]  Well, here's an example.
[01:48:08.549 --> 01:48:22.914]  My cousin is out there merging the APD with the National Guard, the regular Army, at Berkstrom, which is now a private airport, an international airport, and they're engaged in surveillance of Austin, and has nothing to do, he even admits, with terrorism.
[01:48:23.394 --> 01:48:26.556]  Yeah, that's under what's called the Joint Task Force.
[01:48:27.217 --> 01:48:27.577]  Six.
[01:48:28.218 --> 01:48:35.203]  Right, I was involved with that actually during three missions in my career in the Marine Corps.
[01:48:35.323 --> 01:48:38.665]  Two were in Southern California and one was in New Mexico.
[01:48:39.406 --> 01:48:40.647]  And that is true.
[01:48:40.927 --> 01:48:41.647]  The U.S.
[01:48:41.667 --> 01:48:45.050]  government is being used, or the U.S.
[01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:49.693]  Marine Corps, they're being used as surveillance.
[01:48:50.242 --> 01:48:52.503]  You know, for the civilian community.
[01:48:53.003 --> 01:48:54.984]  And then we had the Wall Street Journal two months ago.
[01:48:55.044 --> 01:49:03.288]  They had a peace group at the UT and they had secret military officers in plain clothes harassing them, trying to shut down meetings.
[01:49:03.308 --> 01:49:14.934]  Let me tell you, in America, we're not supposed to have commissars, political officers from the military, running around at the University of Texas.
[01:49:15.134 --> 01:49:16.635]  That was Army intelligence, by the way.
[01:49:18.737 --> 01:49:25.722]  No, and over the course of my 12 years in the Marine Corps, I continuously saw it growing bigger and bigger.
[01:49:26.602 --> 01:49:32.466]  Because they're sub-branching off into these special anti-terrorist units.
[01:49:34.167 --> 01:49:38.090]  So it's happening very rapidly.
[01:49:39.051 --> 01:49:43.634]  And you saw CNN saying, don't trust the pregnant women, watch everyone, report them?
[01:49:43.894 --> 01:49:44.434]  That's correct.
[01:49:44.454 --> 01:49:46.956]  That was on CNN this morning.
[01:49:47.992 --> 01:49:49.573]  That's not America, is it, Sergeant?
[01:49:50.213 --> 01:49:50.713]  No, sir.
[01:49:50.733 --> 01:49:53.234]  That's not the America that I grew up to.
[01:49:55.915 --> 01:50:13.061]  Well, you know, Hitler blew up his own government building to seize control and to set up fatherland security, so... You know, like I said, I started drawing my conclusion after I came back from Iraq, because it disturbed me so much.
[01:50:13.081 --> 01:50:15.102]  And I basically told the Marine Corps,
[01:50:16.198 --> 01:50:18.179]  You know, I don't want your money anymore.
[01:50:18.239 --> 01:50:19.240]  I don't want your benefits.
[01:50:20.300 --> 01:50:25.323]  I had to hire a lawyer because they were trying to say that I was a conscientious observer.
[01:50:26.203 --> 01:50:32.727]  And it got really nasty, but they discharged me honorably with disability and severance pay.
[01:50:32.747 --> 01:50:38.710]  They diagnosed me with post-traumatic stress disorder and major depression, but they didn't want to let me go.
[01:50:38.750 --> 01:50:41.532]  And I tell you what, every day I fear for my life.
[01:50:43.033 --> 01:50:43.973]  Stay there, my friend.
[01:50:43.993 --> 01:50:45.294]  We'll come by and take a few calls.
[01:50:46.866 --> 01:50:47.386]  Who wouldn't?
[01:50:47.426 --> 01:50:51.769]  If you have a conscience, of course you'd be upset after having children die in your arms.
[01:50:52.850 --> 01:51:01.315]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:01.555 --> 01:51:03.796]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:51:03.996 --> 01:51:10.340]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:51:10.720 --> 01:51:11.340]  I think so.
[01:51:30.930 --> 01:51:31.170]  I think so.
[01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:57.296]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:57.496 --> 01:52:01.840]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:04.377 --> 01:52:06.439]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:52:06.539 --> 01:52:09.261]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:52:09.601 --> 01:52:13.824]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:13.904 --> 01:52:20.829]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:20.969 --> 01:52:22.971]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:23.211 --> 01:52:33.739]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:33.959 --> 01:52:39.323]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:52:52.253 --> 01:52:54.235]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:52:54.315 --> 01:53:05.023]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:53:05.403 --> 01:53:09.926]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:53:10.006 --> 01:53:21.335]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:53:21.915 --> 01:53:28.760]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:31.302]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:53:31.802 --> 01:53:36.766]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[01:53:37.066 --> 01:53:43.230]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:53:43.250 --> 01:53:44.351]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[01:53:44.411 --> 01:53:44.991]  That's toll free!
[01:53:45.011 --> 01:53:45.051]  888-803-4438.
[01:53:51.996 --> 01:53:59.800]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.861]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:04.041 --> 01:54:16.307]  Alright, I want to try to keep our guests five minutes into the next hour if we can, then we'll get our next guest on.
[01:54:17.242 --> 01:54:26.849]  Talking about the strange life, the quiet American, Nick Burr, with the intelligence background, obviously, and the bizarreness going on there.
[01:54:26.869 --> 01:54:38.799]  But, boy, this has just been an incredible interview, and I... What scares me is, is some people who don't have a conscience are immune to having children die in their arms.
[01:54:38.819 --> 01:54:40.940]  They're going to come back here and run our lives.
[01:54:42.081 --> 01:54:46.805]  This is all part of the process the New World Order is using, and it's going to be good people,
[01:54:47.928 --> 01:54:57.675]  Like Sergeant Massey, who I guess will be here on the front lines speaking out against it, and who knows, maybe having to fight against it as things get darker here inside this system.
[01:54:58.556 --> 01:55:03.860]  But before we go to some calls, is there anything else you'd like to add, Sergeant?
[01:55:07.582 --> 01:55:14.127]  You know, I know there's a lot more military men and women that are out there that are listening to this.
[01:55:15.268 --> 01:55:16.609]  And you know
[01:55:17.887 --> 01:55:18.807]  You know what you did.
[01:55:20.168 --> 01:55:22.289]  Serve your conscience, not your orders.
[01:55:23.429 --> 01:55:25.450]  Just talk to somebody about it.
[01:55:27.511 --> 01:55:27.891]  That's all.
[01:55:29.652 --> 01:55:34.974]  All right, let's talk to Fred in Philadelphia, then Stavros, Ishmael, and others.
[01:55:35.014 --> 01:55:36.094]  Fred, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:55:36.354 --> 01:55:37.375]  Yeah, great show.
[01:55:37.515 --> 01:55:40.676]  I just wanted to know this one question from the guest.
[01:55:41.757 --> 01:55:47.619]  How do they organize the embedded press in Iraq to control the output of them?
[01:55:48.735 --> 01:55:49.175]  That's all.
[01:55:49.976 --> 01:55:50.396]  Thank you.
[01:55:51.757 --> 01:55:52.097]  Sergeant?
[01:55:52.657 --> 01:55:53.138]  Uh, yeah.
[01:55:54.138 --> 01:55:56.160]  Let me tell you about the Embedded Reporters.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:04.845]  You know, I thought they were doing an outstanding job until I got home and I actually read the propaganda that they had produced.
[01:56:05.925 --> 01:56:13.650]  It got so bad that one of our Embedded Reporters actually wanted to go home because he was witnessing a lot of the civilian casualties.
[01:56:16.075 --> 01:56:27.557]  The reports that I've read about what my battalion did over there, you know, what this embedded reporter wrote is nothing to what actually took place.
[01:56:28.377 --> 01:56:31.798]  So I've been pretty... And who was that embedded reporter?
[01:56:32.778 --> 01:56:37.659]  He was... Can I give his name?
[01:56:37.839 --> 01:56:38.119]  Yes!
[01:56:39.699 --> 01:56:40.119]  Are you sure?
[01:56:40.419 --> 01:56:41.639]  Yes, we give their names here.
[01:56:42.039 --> 01:56:42.379]  Okay.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.000]  He was with the...
[01:56:46.289 --> 01:56:47.090]  Ron Harris.
[01:56:47.290 --> 01:56:48.050]  He was with the St.
[01:56:48.090 --> 01:56:49.131]  Louis Dispatch.
[01:56:51.552 --> 01:56:51.932]  Hmm.
[01:56:52.533 --> 01:56:54.554]  And did you ever see Mr. North?
[01:56:55.475 --> 01:56:56.115]  Mr. North?
[01:56:56.395 --> 01:56:57.136]  Oliver North.
[01:56:58.076 --> 01:56:58.576]  Uh, no.
[01:56:59.017 --> 01:57:05.621]  No, I had heard about his ramblings there in Iraq, but I never actually met him, no.
[01:57:06.541 --> 01:57:09.963]  Talk about the CIA being the implanted reporters and better reporters.
[01:57:10.584 --> 01:57:12.965]  Let's talk to Stavros in Canada.
[01:57:12.985 --> 01:57:13.806]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:57:13.846 --> 01:57:14.186]  Go ahead.
[01:57:14.887 --> 01:57:15.828]  Hi gentlemen, how are you doing?
[01:57:16.028 --> 01:57:16.628]  Fine, go ahead.
[01:57:17.249 --> 01:57:32.099]  Yes, on the subject of shooting civilians, up here in Canada on early April, I was witness to the Canadian military using artillery pieces for target practice in a Canadian park.
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:36.002]  Now, I took a picture of this and I have it here, I can send it to you.
[01:57:36.663 --> 01:57:42.727]  Now, I stuck around and I saw other civilians coming to talk to the military saying, oh, are you guys going to do a parade or something?
[01:57:43.573 --> 01:57:45.914]  And what I heard the response from the military was this.
[01:57:46.074 --> 01:57:55.757]  They said, and I quote, we're merely doing this just in case there are any rioting terrorists come inside the city and try and try it inside the park.
[01:57:57.157 --> 01:57:58.458]  That's what they said word for word.
[01:58:00.598 --> 01:58:08.941]  So in case there's any demonstrations, because in this particular part, Queens Park, you have the provincial legislature, and there are usually demonstrations there.
[01:58:10.782 --> 01:58:12.383]  And they're practicing with artillery?
[01:58:12.723 --> 01:58:13.043]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:13.083 --> 01:58:13.924]  They were shooting blanks.
[01:58:14.484 --> 01:58:15.725]  How large are these pieces?
[01:58:16.425 --> 01:58:19.247]  I believe this one is a 75 millimeter pack howitzer.
[01:58:21.128 --> 01:58:23.129]  Is that a good thing to use on the demonstrators?
[01:58:23.249 --> 01:58:24.090]  A howitzer?
[01:58:25.711 --> 01:58:26.451]  I don't believe so.
[01:58:26.632 --> 01:58:29.754]  I mean, that would kill quite a lot of people.
[01:58:29.974 --> 01:58:31.074]  Well, that's the plan.
[01:58:31.415 --> 01:58:31.995]  Well, thank you.
[01:58:32.035 --> 01:58:32.595]  Thank you for the call.
[01:58:32.615 --> 01:58:35.797]  We'll do five more minutes with our guests, take a few more calls on the other side.
[01:58:35.817 --> 01:58:37.018]  We've got another guest coming up.
[01:58:37.158 --> 01:58:38.039]  Strange life!
[01:58:39.432 --> 01:58:40.273]  Nick Burr!
[01:58:45.559 --> 01:58:46.600]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:49.703]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:58:49.984 --> 01:58:54.128]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:58:54.569 --> 01:58:55.390]  So what do you do?
[01:58:55.710 --> 01:59:00.275]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:59:00.768 --> 01:59:02.890]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:59:54.978 --> 01:59:55.779]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.540 --> 01:59:57.420]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.440 --> 02:00:01.824]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.285 --> 02:00:06.408]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.950 --> 02:00:13.955]  Alright, my friends, you're now into hour number three of this Friday Transmission Against Tyranny.
[02:00:15.692 --> 02:00:33.136]  Coming up, we have William Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News on the Berg Beheading and his article, Berg Met with Shady Iraqi, which exposes the Berg teamed up in Baghdad with an ex-Philippine man who led a controversial group of Iraq expatriates encouraged by the U.S.
[02:00:33.176 --> 02:00:40.378]  government even as he faced deportation for his role in a Russian immigrant crime ring selling millions of vials used for crack.
[02:00:41.277 --> 02:00:51.607]  And then we have him with us, two of the hijackers now, not one, and we have him working at Abu Ghraib prison, and this young man dropping out of college to go help people worldwide.
[02:00:51.787 --> 02:00:55.170]  Very suspicious, and we're sad that he died, if that video's even real.
[02:00:55.851 --> 02:01:04.419]  But let's take two final calls for our guest, Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the world, Sacramento, he broke the story, I killed innocent people for our government.
[02:01:05.278 --> 02:01:06.998]  Ishmael, a lot of calls from Canada.
[02:01:07.439 --> 02:01:09.599]  You're on the air, and we'll try to cram Kenny in here.
[02:01:09.659 --> 02:01:10.459]  Go ahead, Ishmael.
[02:01:10.679 --> 02:01:15.780]  My question is for Mr. Massey in regards to the choice to do what he did in his battalion.
[02:01:15.940 --> 02:01:17.501]  Were they on drugs when they chose to do this?
[02:01:18.981 --> 02:01:19.261]  Well, no.
[02:01:19.321 --> 02:01:23.002]  It's the training, and it's the setup, and it's the intelligence they're given.
[02:01:23.042 --> 02:01:23.562]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:01:25.562 --> 02:01:31.844]  Basically, from the moment that you arrived at Marine Corps boot camp, the dehumanization process began.
[02:01:34.862 --> 02:01:48.689]  If you take a bunch of 17 to 22 year olds and you put them through a rigorous boot camp and continue on with their training and everything is emphasized on dehumanization.
[02:01:48.869 --> 02:01:53.031]  Well look, if you look at the Marine Corps training, it is identical to what Colts do.
[02:01:54.252 --> 02:01:54.552]  Okay.
[02:01:55.513 --> 02:01:56.633]  Do you agree with that Mr. Massey?
[02:01:56.833 --> 02:01:56.913]  Yes.
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:00.180]  Thank you, thank you.
[02:02:00.540 --> 02:02:04.782]  Everybody should read All is Quiet on the Western Front, written by a World War I veteran.
[02:02:04.802 --> 02:02:07.023]  It sounds exactly like what our guest is saying.
[02:02:08.163 --> 02:02:08.483]  Okay?
[02:02:09.484 --> 02:02:23.009]  They take a young man who no longer needs mommy and daddy, and who hasn't gotten bound to a woman yet, who's in that spot in their life, and it's, and the Prussians invented this, and this is, this is the Prussians' brag that it was, that it was programming.
[02:02:23.889 --> 02:02:25.170]  Were you aware of that, Mr. Massey?
[02:02:25.794 --> 02:02:26.294]  Not then.
[02:02:26.314 --> 02:02:33.898]  I didn't become aware of it until I was out on recruiting duty where I was reintroduced back to the civilian world.
[02:02:34.898 --> 02:02:41.961]  And then my last year, I had an epiphany and I woke up and I was like, what in the heck am I doing?
[02:02:42.502 --> 02:02:43.422]  Let's talk to Kenny.
[02:02:44.302 --> 02:02:45.783]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[02:02:45.843 --> 02:02:46.083]  Go ahead.
[02:02:46.103 --> 02:02:46.803]  Where are you calling from?
[02:02:47.084 --> 02:02:48.284]  I'm calling from Kansas City.
[02:02:48.564 --> 02:02:49.445]  I'm a Gulf War vet.
[02:02:49.485 --> 02:02:51.305]  I served in the Army from 85 through 91 as a tanker.
[02:02:53.298 --> 02:03:10.246]  And I guess I'm just really disturbed that the military is no longer training people that you have a right and a moral obligation to disobey unlawful and unconstitutional orders, and you never shoot civilians or people with .50 calibers as for PCs, tanks, heavy equipment, that kind of stuff.
[02:03:10.347 --> 02:03:13.828]  What kind of madness is going on in our country these days and in our military?
[02:03:17.070 --> 02:03:18.390]  Any comments, Sergeant?
[02:03:19.151 --> 02:03:19.311]  Sir?
[02:03:21.155 --> 02:03:24.118]  That's why I'm here, because I want the same answers.
[02:03:25.219 --> 02:03:28.261]  And that's just another part of me patching up another part of my soul.
[02:03:29.742 --> 02:03:44.935]  I'm proud of you, and I guess I'm equally ashamed because I would just think I would hope more people like Michael knew would stand up and say, you know what, this is wrong, this is immoral, and I will not do this, I will not obey this, I wouldn't have done it, I would have told them no, I'm out of here.
[02:03:44.955 --> 02:03:49.959]  Well now we're going to have a new national draft of women too, and we're going to I guess be forced to go do this.
[02:03:53.606 --> 02:03:57.267]  Last question, are the troops aware of the depleted uranium and how dangerous it is?
[02:03:58.448 --> 02:04:02.069]  No, I didn't become aware of what it does to you.
[02:04:02.489 --> 02:04:05.250]  How I became aware of it was reading a Rolling Stones magazine.
[02:04:05.890 --> 02:04:14.073]  And then I started asking around to some of the tankers and other members that I knew that were around it constantly and some of the artillery.
[02:04:14.793 --> 02:04:17.394]  And they began to explain to me.
[02:04:18.154 --> 02:04:19.555]  And I basically
[02:04:20.444 --> 02:04:26.429]  You know, I basically said to myself, holy crap, this is, uh, this is some pretty serious stuff.
[02:04:26.809 --> 02:04:40.300]  So every time, you know, uh, you're in and around a tank that has been disabled, or you're out on the battlefield, or these, uh, these, uh, bombs have landed, or these shells, you know... Tell you what, we've got another guest coming up, but stay there.
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:41.481]  I want to end this on the other side.
[02:04:41.801 --> 02:04:42.942]  We'll bring our next guest up.
[02:04:43.163 --> 02:04:43.563]  Stay with us.
[02:04:45.706 --> 02:04:47.427]  Folks, the future of gardening is upon us.

[02:07:46.783 --> 02:07:52.806]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:07:53.426 --> 02:07:56.448]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:57.849 --> 02:08:00.350]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:08:00.710 --> 02:08:03.412]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[02:08:04.952 --> 02:08:10.653]  We're about to be talking to a Philadelphia Daily News reporter who broke a very important story.
[02:08:11.194 --> 02:08:12.674]  Berg met with Shady Iraqi.
[02:08:13.114 --> 02:08:25.817]  He tied this in with now connections to two hijackers, working at Abu Ghraib prison, being in coalition custody, leaving college with good grades to go help people, the quiet American.
[02:08:26.397 --> 02:08:28.278]  Classic intelligence background M.O.
[02:08:28.338 --> 02:08:29.978]  I'm just thinking there should be an investigation of that.
[02:08:30.378 --> 02:08:33.859]  We'll be talking to the reporter who broke a major story on this last week.
[02:08:34.804 --> 02:08:57.928]  But right now, finishing up with an amazing individual, former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey, who has come out and told the world, I killed innocent people for our government, had children die in his arms, you name it, and had a conscience, and didn't have his conscience seared, and is now working through all of this, and he's just dropped bombshell after bombshell on us today about the embedded reporters manipulating and twisting
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:02.642]  Just how they were ordered to do all of this, what happened.
[02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:08.385]  Sergeant Massey, God bless you and thank you for having the will and the strength.
[02:09:08.405 --> 02:09:09.065]  It's really hard.
[02:09:09.085 --> 02:09:13.148]  A lot of people do these things and then commit themselves to it and make excuses.
[02:09:13.568 --> 02:09:16.530]  It takes a lot of strength, moral courage to do what you've done.
[02:09:18.051 --> 02:09:20.392]  God bless you, sir, and I hope you can work through all of this.
[02:09:21.313 --> 02:09:22.834]  Anything else you'd like to tell the listeners?
[02:09:23.574 --> 02:09:26.436]  Actually, I'd like to read a quote real fast.
[02:09:26.980 --> 02:09:30.262]  We must respect innocent life to achieve peace.
[02:09:31.322 --> 02:09:37.925]  That quote was made by President Bush two days ago over the Israeli and Palestine incident.
[02:09:39.006 --> 02:09:40.586]  What in the hell is he talking about?
[02:09:43.328 --> 02:09:47.430]  We just killed innocent civilians over in Iraq by the hundreds, the thousands.
[02:09:48.130 --> 02:09:51.672]  And he's talking about we must respect innocent life to achieve peace?
[02:09:51.732 --> 02:09:56.094]  Yeah, they're blowing up a wedding, killing 40, and then the Israelis do something smaller and he's
[02:09:57.190 --> 02:09:58.051]  That's incredible.
[02:09:58.111 --> 02:10:03.256]  Well, Sergeant, anytime you've got anything you want to bring up on the show, you've got my producer's number.
[02:10:03.816 --> 02:10:05.978]  And God bless you and take care.
[02:10:06.379 --> 02:10:06.879]  Thank you, sir.
[02:10:07.179 --> 02:10:07.520]  You bet.
[02:10:08.501 --> 02:10:14.146]  Wow, that was an incredible hour interview with Sergeant Massey.
[02:10:14.446 --> 02:10:18.110]  And now for another first hour, we have Kyle Hens.
[02:10:19.225 --> 02:10:29.789]  Co-founder of 9-11 Citizens Watch, a contributor to UnansweredQuestions.org, and Christopher Broder, investigative journalist and activist who confronted Giuliani in the 11th public hearing of the September 11th Commission.
[02:10:30.330 --> 02:10:31.650]  And we had Staff Sergeant Massey.
[02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:37.192]  And now we have daily, a Philadelphia Daily News reporter, William Bunch.
[02:10:37.993 --> 02:10:39.974]  And Mr. Bunch, it's great to have you on with us.
[02:10:39.994 --> 02:10:40.874]  Thanks for taking time out.
[02:10:41.474 --> 02:10:42.675]  Oh, thanks for having me on the show.
[02:10:42.715 --> 02:10:43.695]  It's my pleasure.
[02:10:44.315 --> 02:10:47.937]  Tell folks your newspaper's website or how they can read or find columns.
[02:10:48.590 --> 02:10:49.230]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:49.270 --> 02:11:01.013]  We've been given a decent amount of coverage of what's going on, interact from our own kind of unique perspective, and you can find it on Philly, which folks outside of here don't always know how to spell it.
[02:11:01.073 --> 02:11:05.134]  It's P-H-I-L-L-Y dot com.
[02:11:05.455 --> 02:11:07.135]  And look for the Daily News.
[02:11:07.155 --> 02:11:12.516]  Click on the Daily News, because otherwise you might get a bunch of stuff in the Philadelphia Inquirer, and that's not going to help you out too much.
[02:11:12.536 --> 02:11:14.137]  So look for the Daily News when you go on the
[02:11:14.864 --> 02:11:19.787]  Go to the Philly.com website and look for our coverage of what's going on over in Iraq.
[02:11:20.147 --> 02:11:21.308]  Okay, fantastic.
[02:11:21.548 --> 02:11:37.517]  I mean, you're a reporter, you stick to the absolute facts that you have, but before we get into your story, I mean, now connected to two hijackers, Nick Byrd, leaves an Ivy League school to, quote, travel the world, classic intelligence operative M.O.
[02:11:37.958 --> 02:11:39.899]  You know, quit school with high grades.
[02:11:40.860 --> 02:11:44.303]  Working at Abu Ghraib prison, in coalition custody.
[02:11:44.343 --> 02:11:45.924]  They tried to deny it, now it's admitted.
[02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:46.665]  Thirteen days.
[02:11:47.005 --> 02:11:48.987]  Gets released suddenly in Al-Qaeda hands.
[02:11:49.227 --> 02:11:50.728]  Now we find out it wasn't Al-Qaeda.
[02:11:51.149 --> 02:11:55.373]  MSNBC is saying that this Zawahiri guy died three months ago in Northern Iraq.
[02:11:55.833 --> 02:11:59.476]  I mean, this story has got more holes in it than a sieve.
[02:11:59.576 --> 02:12:05.422]  And then you bring forward your article with him with these shady characters with intelligence agency connections.
[02:12:06.422 --> 02:12:13.867]  With the drug trafficking connections, with the immigrant smuggling connections, I mean, this is amazing!
[02:12:15.508 --> 02:12:18.350]  How do we make heads or tails of all of this, Mr. Bunch?
[02:12:19.170 --> 02:12:21.372]  Well, I mean, it's hard to know what to make of it.
[02:12:21.512 --> 02:12:34.400]  I mean, I would just caution everybody, I think finding out what Nick Berg was all about and what he was doing in Iraq is going to be a time-consuming process and it's not something we're going to
[02:12:35.104 --> 02:12:42.089]  I don't even want to say it's false, but I mean, just the more you check into it as I've done, the more questions
[02:12:59.885 --> 02:13:01.226]  Get raised and go unanswered.
[02:13:01.266 --> 02:13:08.189]  And so, there's a lot, I mean, there's just a lot of questions about who Nick Berg, what he was really all about.
[02:13:08.729 --> 02:13:10.109]  You know, was he really pro-war?
[02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:12.610]  Was he anti-war like his father?
[02:13:13.191 --> 02:13:14.491]  You know, where else did he travel?
[02:13:14.551 --> 02:13:16.072]  How many times did he go to Israel?
[02:13:16.132 --> 02:13:17.453]  What other countries did he visit?
[02:13:18.713 --> 02:13:24.235]  You know, somebody had an article on the internet with, I think, 50 unanswered questions.
[02:13:24.295 --> 02:13:25.556]  And to be honest, there's more than that.
[02:13:26.576 --> 02:13:31.960]  Yeah, well we've said there's 50 anomalies, and you're right.
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:34.541]  And two weeks ago, now more are out there.
[02:13:36.371 --> 02:13:40.173]  I mean, look, he has the classic... I mean, we have to speculate, because everybody's speculating.
[02:13:40.213 --> 02:13:42.634]  We have a bunch of facts, but don't know the answers.
[02:13:43.094 --> 02:13:46.655]  But, I mean, he has the classic intelligence agent M.O.
[02:13:46.996 --> 02:13:55.799]  The country's flooding full of private contractors who are really CIA, and defense intelligence, and Mossad, and Shin Bet, and everything else.
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:13:58.641]  And this guy's got the classic M.O.
[02:13:58.661 --> 02:13:58.861]  of that.
[02:13:58.901 --> 02:14:00.321]  I can't say he was, but...
[02:14:02.751 --> 02:14:04.974]  Yeah, I don't want to jump to any conclusions.
[02:14:05.074 --> 02:14:20.012]  That's not my MO, but you know, I will say, I mean, the fact that his job, you know, his job or his self-style job was to climb these radio and communications towers, including, as you mentioned, the one at Abu Ghraib.
[02:14:21.451 --> 02:14:22.772]  I mean, that's a red flag right there.
[02:14:22.792 --> 02:14:25.374]  That's something that needs to be checked out a little bit more, obviously.
[02:14:25.814 --> 02:14:29.236]  Yes, the quiet American with his bag of tricks out helping.
[02:14:29.957 --> 02:14:33.239]  It's horrible what happened to him, if that can even be documented.
[02:14:33.279 --> 02:14:40.184]  But your article, though, really is one of the best investigations I've seen, and in kind of a window into this murkiness.
[02:14:40.444 --> 02:14:42.725]  Can you go over the details of your story?
[02:14:42.785 --> 02:14:44.506]  Burke met with Shady Iraqi.
[02:14:45.087 --> 02:14:48.409]  Well, that was actually, you know, kind of a follow-up story.
[02:14:48.449 --> 02:14:49.150]  We were actually
[02:14:50.485 --> 02:15:08.203]  The Philadelphia Daily News, we were actually the first newspaper to report about Berger's connections to terrorism or Al-Qaeda suspects down in Oklahoma, including a link either indirectly or directly to Zacharias Moussaoui, who's an admitted member of Al-Qaeda.
[02:15:08.323 --> 02:15:12.567]  Well, he just, I mean, when you're on a bus, don't you just say, here's my computer, here's my password?
[02:15:13.208 --> 02:15:20.353]  Yeah, I don't think that... I have a serious doubt about whether that's the actual way that... No one does that!
[02:15:20.894 --> 02:15:23.075]  Right, right.
[02:15:23.095 --> 02:15:41.168]  Well, my general thinking... Well, let me first go back and... After we broke the story about the Oklahoma and the Mid-Sally connection, that weekend there were some stories coming out of Baghdad and, you know, unfortunately we don't have people over there from the Daily News, I wish we did, but
[02:15:42.201 --> 02:15:53.705]  Just reading the AP story that came out of Baghdad that weekend, they made a reference to a Philadelphian being an Iraqi-born person who lived in Philadelphia who moved back.
[02:15:54.025 --> 02:15:59.627]  And being somewhat parochial like most newspapers, whenever we see the word Philadelphia we get excited.
[02:16:00.087 --> 02:16:01.207]  So I said, who is this guy?
[02:16:01.307 --> 02:16:02.488]  And I started checking into it.
[02:16:03.786 --> 02:16:06.628]  You know, I just couldn't believe all the weird connections that this guy had.
[02:16:06.648 --> 02:16:15.615]  His name is, um... Well, his name was quoted in most papers as Aziz Al-Taei, T-A-E-E, but that's not his real name.
[02:16:15.655 --> 02:16:20.059]  He adopted that a few years ago for reasons that, when you check out his background, seem pretty obvious.
[02:16:20.099 --> 02:16:30.667]  His actual name is Aziz Khaduri Aziz, or Aziz K. Aziz, and he'd come to the United States from Iraq about 20 years ago.
[02:16:32.029 --> 02:16:39.654]  Seemingly a successful businessman who opened a chain of electronics stores in kind of bad neighborhoods in Philadelphia.
[02:16:39.694 --> 02:16:50.301]  It turns out he has a very shady past, including he pleaded guilty back in 1994 to being part of a huge ring that was distributing crack vials.
[02:16:50.661 --> 02:16:54.724]  Not the actual crack itself, but the vials that people used to sell crack.
[02:16:55.464 --> 02:16:59.827]  Most of his partners in this enterprise were Soviet
[02:17:01.209 --> 02:17:09.115]  Soviet... I don't want to cast religious... I don't know the religion, but I know they were mostly Soviet emigres who'd come over in the 70s.
[02:17:10.776 --> 02:17:11.437]  And that was weird.
[02:17:11.657 --> 02:17:12.818]  So, that was one thing.
[02:17:12.838 --> 02:17:18.082]  The other thing is, he went on from this, however, to form this group called the Iraqi American Council.
[02:17:20.003 --> 02:17:21.684]  By the way, I just typed that name in.
[02:17:21.724 --> 02:17:23.346]  That's a known CIA front group.
[02:17:24.947 --> 02:17:25.627]  Well, absolutely.
[02:17:25.667 --> 02:17:27.288]  I mean, it's hard.
[02:17:27.308 --> 02:17:29.970]  You have to follow the board of directors, but it does go back to...
[02:17:31.383 --> 02:17:32.744]  You know, there are definite possibilities.
[02:17:32.824 --> 02:17:35.466]  It's one of these government-funded Iraqi opposition groups.
[02:17:35.526 --> 02:17:37.568]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:17:38.468 --> 02:17:49.317]  And I'm sure your listeners remember the Clear Channel sponsored rallies for America, the so-called pro-troop or pro-war rallies a year ago.
[02:17:49.337 --> 02:17:56.582]  And people from this group, the Iraqi American Council, got training from our State Department
[02:17:57.694 --> 02:18:09.159]  To go through these rallies, to go on Fox News and to go on other channels and talk about how terrible Saddam was and how much better the world would be if we got rid of him.
[02:18:09.419 --> 02:18:15.622]  And Aziz K. Aziz, or Aziz Al-Faiz, he was calling himself by this point,
[02:18:16.287 --> 02:18:17.828]  He spoke at a number of these rallies.
[02:18:17.908 --> 02:18:18.849]  He was at D.C.
[02:18:18.909 --> 02:18:20.630]  He spoke in Philly and St.
[02:18:20.650 --> 02:18:21.170]  Louis.
[02:18:21.250 --> 02:18:25.713]  So we've got this obvious intel operative and he's involved in all this shady stuff.
[02:18:26.093 --> 02:18:27.954]  And then, oh, he's buddies with Berg!
[02:18:30.035 --> 02:18:35.218]  Yeah, I mean, we're now reporting that that's your trump, that he's an intel operative.
[02:18:35.238 --> 02:18:41.362]  But yeah, I mean, he definitely has, like we said in our story, he definitely has a shady past, no doubt about it.
[02:18:42.202 --> 02:18:43.723]  He definitely has these government connections.
[02:18:43.763 --> 02:18:44.604]  He definitely has these
[02:18:45.103 --> 02:18:47.765]  Fox News, their channel, State Department.
[02:18:48.085 --> 02:18:48.765]  Right, right, right.
[02:18:49.306 --> 02:19:13.662]  And, um, so, um, and then, oh, and then, because of his criminal record, however, um, I guess this is typical government, left hand, not knowing what the right's doing, at the same time he's getting his stacking from the State Department and, and, and possibly CIA type sources or whatever, meanwhile the immigration's moving to deport him now because it is, uh, because he had a couple other arrests in addition to the crackpile, um,
[02:19:14.306 --> 02:19:14.766]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:19:46.098 --> 02:19:54.006]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[02:19:54.327 --> 02:19:59.612]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[02:19:59.793 --> 02:20:02.375]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[02:20:02.515 --> 02:20:07.661]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[02:20:08.121 --> 02:20:10.624]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.
[02:20:10.904 --> 02:20:15.649]  Ready Reserve Foods has been helping businesses, government, and individuals for over 32 years.

[02:21:05.618 --> 02:21:11.722]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:11.862 --> 02:21:13.063]  There are no side effects.

[02:21:46.337 --> 02:21:48.559]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:21:48.979 --> 02:21:53.342]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:21:53.623 --> 02:21:59.427]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:21:59.647 --> 02:22:03.710]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:22:04.010 --> 02:22:09.635]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:22:09.755 --> 02:22:12.377]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:22:14.458 --> 02:22:18.359]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:22:18.399 --> 02:22:20.780]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:22:21.120 --> 02:22:23.421]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:22:23.801 --> 02:22:27.423]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:22:27.903 --> 02:22:34.105]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:22:34.565 --> 02:22:35.545]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:22:35.885 --> 02:22:36.206]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:36.226 --> 02:22:36.406]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:46.522 --> 02:22:50.846]  Just once, I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[02:22:51.526 --> 02:22:55.910]  Just once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily residue that attracts dust and dirt.
[02:22:56.510 --> 02:22:59.493]  Introducing, just once, the amazing non-slip protectant.
[02:23:00.149 --> 02:23:04.233]  Just Once cleans, protects, and shines vinyl, leather, rubber, and hard plastics.

[02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:18.344]  Just Once is excellent for use on cars, trucks, motorcycles, boats, truck bedliners, and RVs.
[02:23:19.205 --> 02:23:29.234]  You can use it on dashboard, leather and vinyl interiors, motorcycle seats and tires, floor mats, convertible tops, brake pedals or anywhere you need ultimate protection, including leather furniture, shoes and purses.
[02:23:29.795 --> 02:23:33.398]  Just Once has been used commercially nationwide and now it's available to you.
[02:23:34.019 --> 02:23:40.585]  To order, call 888-578-6623 or visit JustOnce.com on the World Wide Web.
[02:23:40.945 --> 02:23:42.527]  That's JustOnce.com.
[02:23:52.369 --> 02:24:00.954]  Alright, I don't know how long our guest could stay with us, but I'd like him to into the next segment so we can take some calls.
[02:24:00.994 --> 02:24:03.716]  And I would ask callers to direct some questions or comments to him.
[02:24:04.905 --> 02:24:09.110]  Because we don't screen calls here, but when I do have guests on, it'd be nice if you talked to the guests.
[02:24:09.130 --> 02:24:09.450]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:09.470 --> 02:24:22.203]  We haven't even gotten into the meat and potatoes yet on this incredible article, Berg met with Shady Iraqi, and there's been other reports by William Bunch, the Philadelphia Daily News, philly.com.
[02:24:23.379 --> 02:24:24.840]  The website.
[02:24:24.920 --> 02:24:42.131]  William, continuing here now, his connection, he's saying, you called him up, he's saying now in the news article that, oh yeah, I saw him, he left, I don't know where he's at, I saw him just a few hours a day before he disappeared.
[02:24:44.072 --> 02:24:46.354]  Again, Merck met with Shady Iraqi.
[02:24:46.814 --> 02:24:47.575]  Let's get into that.
[02:24:50.641 --> 02:25:02.890]  Aziz, as we call him, appears according to his version of events, and everything that has to do with Iraq, you have to quantify somebody's version of what's really happening.
[02:25:02.910 --> 02:25:11.416]  But Aziz's version basically has him being the last person to speak with Nick Berg before he disappeared.
[02:25:11.456 --> 02:25:18.422]  He says that on April 10th, supposedly when Berg was in Weber's custody, whether it was
[02:25:19.595 --> 02:25:21.977]  Um, you know, American or Iraqi custody.
[02:25:21.997 --> 02:25:26.922]  Supposedly, then he, um... Excuse me for a second.
[02:25:27.322 --> 02:25:32.787]  Um, supposedly, then he, um, went to Baghdad and checked into a hotel for four days.
[02:25:33.167 --> 02:25:43.316]  Uh, you know, resumed his connection with Aziz, who, um, I don't know if he mentioned in the narrative here, but was, um, hooked up with Berg in Iraq as his business partner.
[02:25:43.356 --> 02:25:45.938]  They formed a company called Babylon Towers that was,
[02:25:46.825 --> 02:25:47.566]  I don't think so.
[02:25:57.935 --> 02:26:02.759]  He said Nick Berg called him and told him he'd gotten a ride with a couple people.
[02:26:02.799 --> 02:26:04.561]  He was going to Jordan to leave the country.
[02:26:04.701 --> 02:26:06.502]  Now, I know this.
[02:26:06.823 --> 02:26:09.345]  In America, the cops will be talking to this guy.
[02:26:09.365 --> 02:26:18.733]  The last person you're with, and, oh, I saw him get a ride, and, oh, I do stuff with the State Department, and I get these rallies together, and I'm involved in shipping out
[02:26:20.133 --> 02:26:28.035]  Crack vials, and I'm doing all this, and Mr. Berg's involved with some hijackers with passwords, but there's nothing suspicious here!
[02:26:28.055 --> 02:26:30.416]  I mean, this is incredible!
[02:26:30.436 --> 02:26:33.516]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[02:26:34.077 --> 02:26:40.818]  Yeah, you're right, usually the last person to see somebody alive is questioned.
[02:26:41.018 --> 02:26:44.339]  This guy needs to be under the hot lights with some guys asking him some questions.
[02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:49.131]  Yeah, and we don't know if that's been done, although it doesn't seem like it.
[02:26:49.151 --> 02:26:52.092]  He seems to be operating freely over there in Baghdad.
[02:26:52.772 --> 02:26:54.552]  He also made an interesting claim.
[02:26:54.572 --> 02:27:10.396]  He claimed that Aziz is in the cell phone business, and he has claimed that he's actually seen Nick Berg's cell phone records, and that his cell phone was used, I think, as late as April 19th, which would be, remember now, nine days after he disappeared.
[02:27:12.406 --> 02:27:15.988]  That's an interesting and unexplained fact there, too.
[02:27:18.509 --> 02:27:30.055]  So, yeah, there's a lot of questions about... Well, he's trying to create space for the government, speculating here, from, you know, he gets released and suddenly in Al-Qaeda hands, and now they admit it's not Al-Qaeda.
[02:27:30.075 --> 02:27:40.501]  I mean, this whole thing... Well, the latest, I mean, I think you're referring to the story that came out today, which is very curious, in which you have some Iraqi officials now claiming that
[02:27:41.417 --> 02:27:53.344]  Some people were in custody, and they're not Al-Qaeda at all, but they're Fedayeen, who are associated with Saddam Hussein, and one of them is Saddam Hussein's nephew, or not one of the people they arrested.
[02:27:53.364 --> 02:27:56.906]  But then it comes out now that says that...
[02:27:58.479 --> 02:28:11.150]  They've already released two out of these four people, and they might be releasing the other, so... Well, it's like 20 times they found sarin gas and later say it isn't sarin gas, and then I have arguments with people that, oh yeah, they found the sarin gas.
[02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:13.131]  I mean, this is all propaganda!
[02:28:13.732 --> 02:28:17.175]  This is classic propaganda where they put a story out and then retract it later.
[02:28:17.655 --> 02:28:19.436]  How many times did they kill Chemical Ali?
[02:28:19.476 --> 02:28:20.457]  Like, five or something?
[02:28:20.477 --> 02:28:27.163]  You know, I mean, uh... Well, they, I mean, the guys supposedly saw in Nick Berg's head off MSNBC the Pentagon said was dead three months ago.
[02:28:27.939 --> 02:28:29.399]  Yeah, I'll talk to Ali.
[02:28:29.419 --> 02:28:30.820]  He knows what's up with that.
[02:28:32.420 --> 02:28:39.702]  Yeah, and I know the guy cutting his head off isn't hobbling and sure has a lot of mobility to be, you know, for one leg.
[02:28:39.722 --> 02:28:43.683]  Yeah, that didn't add up.
[02:28:43.723 --> 02:28:45.604]  There's a lot of things about the video that don't add up.
[02:28:46.804 --> 02:28:48.905]  Yeah, like not a lot of blood.
[02:28:48.925 --> 02:28:53.046]  I mean, I've been in a slaughterhouse and you cut a large mammal's head off, folks.
[02:28:53.066 --> 02:28:54.006]  You better stand back.
[02:28:55.018 --> 02:28:56.640]  I don't want to get too graphic here.
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:57.660]  Have you seen the video?
[02:28:59.061 --> 02:29:00.282]  Yes, I have, unfortunately.
[02:29:00.322 --> 02:29:01.744]  I mean, it's pretty grisly.
[02:29:01.764 --> 02:29:02.544]  Yeah, we've seen it.
[02:29:02.564 --> 02:29:04.266]  We had it up for a while, took it down.
[02:29:05.266 --> 02:29:05.607]  I don't know.
[02:29:05.627 --> 02:29:06.688]  I go back and forth on it.
[02:29:06.728 --> 02:29:08.069]  Well, we've got a break, sir.
[02:29:08.089 --> 02:29:09.710]  Can we come back and take a few calls for you?
[02:29:10.511 --> 02:29:10.891]  Absolutely.
[02:29:10.931 --> 02:29:11.531]  I have a few minutes.
[02:29:11.592 --> 02:29:11.852]  Go ahead.
[02:29:11.992 --> 02:29:12.833]  Okay, let's do that.
[02:29:13.033 --> 02:29:16.395]  We'll come back and go to Rodney and Chris.
[02:29:18.226 --> 02:29:20.728]  Fred in Philadelphia, and John in Florida, and others.
[02:29:21.348 --> 02:29:22.689]  Poll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:29:22.809 --> 02:29:29.753]  And it's great to have reporters like William Bunch out there from the Philadelphia Daily News.
[02:29:30.193 --> 02:29:32.515]  I'm Alex Jones, and fullwars.com.
[02:29:36.057 --> 02:29:36.977]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.458 --> 02:29:39.059]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.979 --> 02:29:42.661]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:56.007 --> 02:30:06.397]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[02:30:06.557 --> 02:30:10.901]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:30:11.081 --> 02:30:19.423]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[02:30:19.703 --> 02:30:26.065]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as leads, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul tastes like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[02:30:54.193 --> 02:30:54.693]  time zone.
[02:30:54.873 --> 02:30:55.694]  This is the U.S.
[02:30:55.714 --> 02:30:58.334]  official atomic clock located in Fort Collins, Colorado.
[02:30:58.495 --> 02:31:03.276]  It's the same atomic clock that governs ship movements, radio stations, space flights, and warplanes.
[02:31:03.456 --> 02:31:05.418]  We use them right here at the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:31:05.678 --> 02:31:12.144]  These self-setting atomic clocks contain a completely hidden antenna and receiver tuned to the exact frequency of the official U.S.
[02:31:12.184 --> 02:31:12.805]  atomic clock.
[02:31:12.965 --> 02:31:13.766]  How accurate is it?
[02:31:13.966 --> 02:31:17.689]  This clock will not gain or lose one second in the next million years.
[02:31:17.930 --> 02:31:20.832]  The radio signal automatically sets your clock for daylight savings.
[02:31:21.093 --> 02:31:23.435]  If you travel, this is the last clock you'll ever buy.
[02:31:23.695 --> 02:31:26.737]  Even if you don't travel, you'll use it to set the time on your other clocks.

[02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:55.752]  Thank you for joining us on this Friday, the 21st of May, 2004 edition.
[02:33:15.794 --> 02:33:24.479]  As we blast out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on Global Shortwave, and the internet at PrisonPlanet.tv.com and InfoWars.com as well.
[02:33:25.280 --> 02:33:32.024]  Before we go back to our guest, William Bunch from Philadelphia Daily News, and take some calls here from people patiently holding
[02:33:33.331 --> 02:33:37.955]  I want to encourage everybody out there to go sign up today at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:38.035 --> 02:33:54.150]  It's only 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up on a monthly basis, weekly, multiple weekly usually, special TV reports I do here locally that are on the site, the best interviews, the audio interviews we do like this one right now.

[02:34:00.656 --> 02:34:02.957]  All my videos, all ten of them, are there on the site.
[02:34:03.698 --> 02:34:04.998]  This helps us with the bandwidth.
[02:34:05.038 --> 02:34:11.521]  We kept putting it out for free everywhere, just like the New York Post wrote us up yesterday, page six doing this, and we still offer most of it free.
[02:34:11.541 --> 02:34:21.825]  But you can't have 20 million visitors a month and have them watching videos for free, or I'm going to live on the side of the road and not have a radio show anymore, because I do this separately from the radio network.
[02:34:22.385 --> 02:34:26.789]  So help us get the word out, to get the special weekly reports and a lot of the other information.
[02:34:26.809 --> 02:34:33.995]  About half the site is still free, but if you want to support us, prisonplanet.tv, go sign up today!
[02:34:35.018 --> 02:34:39.863]  Also, I've made ten films, written a book, published a book, carry a bunch of other great books and videos.

[02:34:50.694 --> 02:34:55.539]  It also comes with three political pamphlets that go over the history of tyranny and how they disarm us.
[02:34:56.347 --> 02:34:57.028]  So get that.
[02:34:57.528 --> 02:35:04.915]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via our SecureSafe shopping cart or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:35:06.237 --> 02:35:11.622]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, about 9-11, the truth of it, and the police state unfolding.
[02:35:20.973 --> 02:35:21.133]  224 pages, $12.

[02:35:29.880 --> 02:35:29.940]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:30.000 --> 02:35:32.102]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:35:51.684 --> 02:35:59.690]  We're going to go to all these calls here in just a moment, but talking to the reporter William Bunch from the Philadelphia Daily News broke the story Berg met with Shady Iraqi.
[02:36:00.210 --> 02:36:02.892]  Any other key points you want to add before we go to these calls?
[02:36:04.193 --> 02:36:16.622]  Well, right now in terms of like further areas to be checking out, right now I'm trying to find out more about Nick Berg's time in Oklahoma and very little has been explained about
[02:36:17.762 --> 02:36:23.966]  What's really behind the so-called password on the bus story and who he really knew and who he met down there?
[02:36:25.087 --> 02:36:28.249]  We're going to look into that.
[02:36:28.269 --> 02:36:34.113]  There's a lot of downtime, if you look at his resume, between the time he went to college and when he turned up in Iraq.
[02:36:36.459 --> 02:36:39.381]  Give some clues into what's going on with this guy.
[02:36:39.421 --> 02:36:45.606]  Again, just to state this, the government recruits people with high grade point averages out of the Ivy League.
[02:36:46.606 --> 02:36:49.848]  They've had a big recruiting drive for 25-year-olds to 29-year-olds.
[02:36:49.889 --> 02:36:51.750]  That's even been in State Department press releases.
[02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:53.591]  This stinks to high heaven.
[02:36:53.631 --> 02:36:54.592]  We can't say that.
[02:36:55.032 --> 02:36:57.214]  We can just say it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck.
[02:36:57.254 --> 02:36:58.614]  What is it?
[02:36:59.315 --> 02:37:01.777]  Yes, I'd love to have you back on if you can get that information.
[02:37:02.697 --> 02:37:05.179]  Who's up first here out of all these callers, Stephanie?
[02:37:09.233 --> 02:37:11.314]  Rodney in Florida, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:37:12.095 --> 02:37:13.195]  Randy, okay, go ahead.
[02:37:14.716 --> 02:37:25.803]  Yeah, well, you know, all I can say about this burg is that, you know, if we weren't over there sticking our nose in where it didn't belong, we wouldn't have any of that happening or the POW mess that we're encountering now.
[02:37:27.083 --> 02:37:38.250]  And I'm just reading right now on Yahoo News about a Florida-based soldier who was found guilty today of desertion over there, who objected to it and refused to go back on conscientious grounds.
[02:37:39.898 --> 02:37:41.620]  Yes, yeah, I've read about that.
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:43.141]  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.
[02:37:43.181 --> 02:37:54.772]  I mean, there's no, you know, if we were not in Iraq and in Philly, that was a, quote, voluntary or optional, whatever you want to call it, war, and didn't seem to be particularly necessary.
[02:37:55.113 --> 02:37:57.395]  And, and now we have these things happening.
[02:37:57.495 --> 02:38:02.720]  And then they, you know, they're, you know, knocking America's image,
[02:38:03.991 --> 02:38:05.051]  Around the world even lower.
[02:38:05.471 --> 02:38:08.652]  Also, they say, oh, they're volunteers, these troops.
[02:38:09.172 --> 02:38:11.353]  Well, a lot of them were supposed to be in three, four years.
[02:38:11.373 --> 02:38:12.593]  Now they won't let them leave.
[02:38:13.453 --> 02:38:14.834]  So that really is a draft.
[02:38:15.154 --> 02:38:16.394]  Yeah, that's the point.
[02:38:16.614 --> 02:38:18.595]  I bring that up in this article, too.
[02:38:18.675 --> 02:38:23.016]  I salute this boy, because I have yet to have any congressman say or hear
[02:38:24.019 --> 02:38:29.603]  Any of them say that this was a war done under the Constitution, you know, with a declaration of war.
[02:38:29.623 --> 02:38:33.646]  No, the Congress is supposed to declare it, and again, this is out of control.
[02:38:33.666 --> 02:38:34.386]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:35.227 --> 02:38:38.529]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Philadelphia, where our reporter joins us from.
[02:38:38.649 --> 02:38:39.670]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:38:39.770 --> 02:38:40.671]  Yeah, great show.
[02:38:41.251 --> 02:38:47.576]  I just wanted to call, and I have two things, two pretty pertinent things.
[02:38:49.097 --> 02:38:50.077]  I actually witnessed
[02:38:51.827 --> 02:39:20.884]  uh... the recruitment of a young veteran twenty eight years old at a local suburban library in the late nineties for the uh... of the Balkans uh... like a uh... specific technical job for the CIA and uh... that is the type of that is the age group that is the uh... the qualifications for uh... uh... intelligence community to to hire people
[02:39:21.897 --> 02:39:23.877]  You know, I don't like your conspiracy theory.
[02:39:23.937 --> 02:39:36.960]  So he's trading passwords with now two hijackers, so he's working in Abu Ghraib prison, so he's hanging out with people that are involved in all this shady stuff, and he's in coalition custody, and he's flying back and forth between Israel.
[02:39:37.600 --> 02:39:38.801]  I mean, come on, man!
[02:39:38.821 --> 02:39:47.562]  I bet you're the type of person that if you saw a guy in a black mask walking out of your house with your television set at 3 a.m., I bet you'd think that was a robber.
[02:39:47.902 --> 02:39:49.443]  You're a conspiracy theorist, okay?
[02:39:51.384 --> 02:40:01.293]  No, but the other thing is that I wanted to report that in the 90s there was a big, it seemed to me like there was a lot of recruitment.
[02:40:01.313 --> 02:40:09.001]  The other thing was on Nick Berg, the occupational description of him changed in the local news in Philadelphia.
[02:40:10.073 --> 02:40:13.995]  Uh, first thing, it was simply personal characteristics they mentioned.
[02:40:14.255 --> 02:40:19.037]  Well, that was as the news was getting what the government said, then reporters went out and found out the truth like Mr. Bunch.
[02:40:19.197 --> 02:40:21.859]  Yeah, they first said he was just able to make friends.
[02:40:22.479 --> 02:40:25.600]  Uh, they didn't talk about occupational, uh, uh, description.
[02:40:26.021 --> 02:40:32.544]  And then they had said that he was trained in marketing, uh, without mentioning that apparently he, his, uh,
[02:40:34.079 --> 02:40:38.562]  His huge expertise was radio engineering and electrical engineering.
[02:40:38.582 --> 02:40:41.504]  And then when that comes out, that's a good point.
[02:40:41.524 --> 02:40:47.729]  We've had a lot of absconding and a lot of stonewalling by the government, Mr. Bunch.
[02:40:49.230 --> 02:40:50.651]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:40:50.731 --> 02:40:55.014]  And that's a good point in that because I've been on the story since the first day.
[02:40:55.034 --> 02:40:58.477]  And the first day, you know, it's always a case of these things.
[02:40:58.537 --> 02:41:00.098]  It's just a matter of shock.
[02:41:00.318 --> 02:41:00.879]  And look,
[02:41:01.904 --> 02:41:11.569]  A couple things, and I meant to say some of this out front, is, you know, whatever his purposes were... What happened to him was horrible.
[02:41:11.830 --> 02:41:12.810]  What happened to him, two things.
[02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:15.111]  What happened to him was horrible, by all accounts.
[02:41:16.192 --> 02:41:19.874]  The people who knew him were very fond of him and liked him.
[02:41:21.255 --> 02:41:25.317]  Regardless of who killed him... Yeah, it's a tragedy.
[02:41:25.357 --> 02:41:27.178]  We just shouldn't have the government lying about it.
[02:41:27.907 --> 02:41:28.668]  Right, exactly.
[02:41:28.708 --> 02:41:42.800]  And, you know, um, I mean, clearly, um, you know, the fact that first, you know, first that they said it was this, uh, Abu Mas'ab al-Bukhari supposedly was fingered, you know, definitively by the CIA or whatever is the killer.
[02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:48.545]  And then we're hearing today that they're arresting people from a completely, you know, totally different group, the fedayeen.
[02:41:48.845 --> 02:41:51.427]  And, um, you know, it's like anything else.
[02:41:51.447 --> 02:41:55.611]  I mean, you know, if that information is bogus, then what else, you know, what else aren't they telling us?
[02:41:56.385 --> 02:41:57.246]  Or are they trying to mislead us all?
[02:41:57.266 --> 02:42:02.389]  And then we'll have arguments when the government admits... I mean, people... Powell admits those weren't mobile weapons trucks.
[02:42:02.810 --> 02:42:08.854]  Jones admitted it six months ago, and I still have arguments with people, William, saying those were mobile weapons trucks.
[02:42:10.175 --> 02:42:14.318]  Uh, yeah, well, once information gets out there, it's hard to... That's been my experience.
[02:42:14.398 --> 02:42:20.682]  Once information gets published or promulgated out there, it's hard to... You know, it stays there for a long time.
[02:42:20.702 --> 02:42:25.346]  You know, even if the person who actually said it, like in this case, like Powell, even if the person who
[02:42:25.908 --> 02:42:31.472]  You know, it was the one saying the information in the first place that people still have a hard time, you know, accepting that.
[02:42:31.552 --> 02:42:32.392]  I see that all the time.
[02:42:33.453 --> 02:42:34.894]  Yeah, thanks for the call, Fred.
[02:42:34.934 --> 02:42:36.435]  Let's talk to John in Florida.
[02:42:36.855 --> 02:42:37.656]  John, you're on the air.
[02:42:37.676 --> 02:42:38.897]  And then one more call for our guest.
[02:42:38.917 --> 02:42:39.517]  Go ahead, John.
[02:42:39.817 --> 02:42:40.298]  Howdy, Alex.
[02:42:40.518 --> 02:42:40.958]  Howdy, William.
[02:42:41.238 --> 02:42:46.041]  I'll try to restrain myself with comments and questions as to your investigative efforts here, okay?
[02:42:46.061 --> 02:42:49.684]  And I'm glad to hear that you're going to go out to Oklahoma and elsewhere on this man's trail.
[02:42:53.086 --> 02:42:53.727]  Let me stop you.
[02:42:53.767 --> 02:42:55.568]  Let me just tell the reporter, be very careful.
[02:42:56.663 --> 02:42:58.049]  Yeah, somebody made a leap.
[02:42:58.270 --> 02:43:00.981]  I have no plans to go to Oklahoma at this point.
[02:43:02.411 --> 02:43:06.133]  Well, you may have found that you were going to try and find out more what he was doing in college out there.
[02:43:06.173 --> 02:43:11.016]  You'd be surprised that you can learn with a telephone and a good directory, so... Yes.
[02:43:11.316 --> 02:43:11.696]  Okay.
[02:43:11.716 --> 02:43:13.978]  We're going to start that way first, and we'll see.
[02:43:13.998 --> 02:43:15.078]  Okay, go ahead, John.
[02:43:15.138 --> 02:43:21.102]  In your statements about half an hour ago, you referred to some Russian immigrants, and you were very reluctant to mention a religious sect.
[02:43:21.242 --> 02:43:22.983]  And I'm wondering, are these Orthodox Jews?
[02:43:23.003 --> 02:43:23.843]  I don't know for a fact.
[02:43:24.043 --> 02:43:26.445]  I mean, some of them, I believe, according to the clips,
[02:43:27.598 --> 02:43:30.641]  What does Mr. Berg, the father, do for a living?
[02:43:30.681 --> 02:43:36.125]  I understand he and his son seem to have been, like, so active in this, you know, tower building, whatever, microwave.
[02:43:49.617 --> 02:43:58.500]  I mean, Michael Berg, the father for a long time, was a school teacher in the same district in Westchester, Pennsylvania, where Nick Berg went to school.
[02:43:58.840 --> 02:44:00.281]  Now, he retired a few years ago.
[02:44:00.301 --> 02:44:01.521]  I guess he took an early retirement.
[02:44:02.401 --> 02:44:10.824]  And he has been, it is a fact that he was involved with his son's business.
[02:44:11.124 --> 02:44:12.085]  He represented himself
[02:44:13.129 --> 02:44:15.593]  On several occasions, like the office manager.
[02:44:15.633 --> 02:44:18.838]  It's funny, they didn't seem to have any equipment that I know of and things like that.
[02:44:18.858 --> 02:44:19.839]  Maybe they subcontracted.
[02:44:19.859 --> 02:44:20.140]  Who knows?
[02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:20.861]  But one more item.
[02:44:21.061 --> 02:44:21.562]  Okay, please.
[02:44:22.303 --> 02:44:28.933]  CNN has about two weeks ago done a lot of talking to people over there in Iraq.
[02:44:29.446 --> 02:44:34.511]  One of them was named Andrew Duke, who allegedly is a friend of Mr. Berg's.
[02:44:35.672 --> 02:44:38.735]  I'm interested in knowing more about this Andrew Duke.
[02:44:38.775 --> 02:44:42.439]  This man seems to be talking as though he was intimately involved with him.
[02:44:42.519 --> 02:44:45.502]  And Mr. Duke looks to be of Semitic origins.
[02:44:45.642 --> 02:44:47.604]  He looks like Yasser Arafat's twin.
[02:44:48.763 --> 02:44:56.148]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:44:57.149 --> 02:44:57.909]  I appreciate it.
[02:44:58.449 --> 02:45:07.975]  I mean, obviously you've got this Russian mafia people and all this going back and forth and the dad's involved in the business and weird stuff with hijackers.
[02:45:08.035 --> 02:45:08.776]  I mean, folks,
[02:45:09.965 --> 02:45:10.886]  This is unbelievable.
[02:45:11.566 --> 02:45:16.389]  But again, the question is, if it is intelligence, is it CIA, is it Mossad?
[02:45:17.009 --> 02:45:21.451]  I guess we've got to have reporters like William Bunch try to find out what's going on here.
[02:45:21.471 --> 02:45:27.154]  I know we've got a stench coming from below the floorboards, but is it a possum or is it a human body?
[02:45:28.495 --> 02:45:29.555]  Do you see where I'm going with that?
[02:45:30.596 --> 02:45:31.496]  I see where you're going.
[02:45:31.536 --> 02:45:34.558]  As far as I'm concerned, I'm just going to try and see where the facts go.
[02:45:35.218 --> 02:45:37.900]  It all starts from there.
[02:45:39.178 --> 02:45:40.999]  So far there's been a lot more speculation than fact.
[02:45:41.380 --> 02:45:44.502]  I don't even think we know half the truth yet.
[02:45:45.022 --> 02:45:46.864]  So stay tuned everybody.
[02:45:47.084 --> 02:45:49.846]  We'll see what else is coming out.
[02:45:50.547 --> 02:45:54.390]  Alright, Joanne in Maryland, last caller for our guest.
[02:45:54.670 --> 02:45:55.530]  Joanne, go ahead.
[02:45:55.911 --> 02:45:57.552]  Yes, thank you for taking my call.
[02:45:57.952 --> 02:46:00.074]  I have a statement actually.
[02:46:00.254 --> 02:46:02.596]  I was watching our local
[02:46:03.083 --> 02:46:04.464]  We're good to go.
[02:46:32.659 --> 02:46:33.599]  That's all I wanted to say.
[02:46:33.619 --> 02:46:37.361]  I just wanted to, you know, tell him that he was on the Eastern Shore sometime or another.
[02:46:38.021 --> 02:46:39.221]  Yeah, well, thanks for that information.
[02:46:39.261 --> 02:46:53.446]  I mean, clearly, you know, Chloe Nickberg had some expertise in the communications tower business, and he did work for, you know, all the evidence I've seen is he worked for a number of, you know, bona fide radio stations around the East Coast.
[02:46:53.886 --> 02:46:55.607]  Well, they spoke very highly of him, anyway.
[02:46:55.627 --> 02:46:56.807]  Thank you.
[02:46:56.847 --> 02:46:58.648]  Yes, that was the point I was trying to make earlier.
[02:46:58.668 --> 02:46:59.328]  I mean, people who
[02:46:59.847 --> 02:47:05.248]  New Nick Berg, all speak highly of him, and that makes his loss even more tragic.
[02:47:06.669 --> 02:47:08.469]  Well, it's all very suspicious.
[02:47:08.569 --> 02:47:24.373]  The facts we do have are very suspicious, but we do need to get more facts before we go to conclusions, but I really appreciate you joining us, Mr. Bunch, from the Philadelphia Daily News, your busy schedule, and we can continue to watch your columns, your reports, there at philly.com.
[02:47:25.769 --> 02:47:29.951]  And we really appreciate you coming on, and please contact us if there's a new development.
[02:47:30.811 --> 02:47:31.371]  Absolutely.
[02:47:31.431 --> 02:47:32.432]  I'll send it along, you guys.
[02:47:32.952 --> 02:47:36.033]  I've got your email now, and it should be no problem.
[02:47:36.433 --> 02:47:38.494]  And I hope there is more that comes out.
[02:47:38.554 --> 02:47:40.314]  I think I'm pretty sure there will be.
[02:47:40.394 --> 02:47:42.275]  And in the meantime, thanks for having me on the show.
[02:47:42.815 --> 02:47:45.416]  Well, so your editor's letting you work more on this story?
[02:47:46.397 --> 02:47:47.257]  Absolutely.
[02:47:47.497 --> 02:47:48.057]  Absolutely.
[02:47:48.277 --> 02:47:49.758]  So we'll see what develops.
[02:47:49.978 --> 02:47:50.258]  Okay.
[02:47:50.298 --> 02:47:51.178]  Thanks a lot for coming on.
[02:47:51.218 --> 02:47:51.759]  Take care, William.
[02:47:51.779 --> 02:47:52.059]  All right.
[02:47:52.079 --> 02:47:52.379]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:52.399 --> 02:47:52.579]  Bye-bye.
[02:47:53.308 --> 02:47:56.630]  All right, well that was just four incredible guests today.
[02:47:56.690 --> 02:48:20.221]  In the first hour, co-founder of the 9-11 Citizens Watch and contributor to Unanswered Questions, and Hens, who was president of the 11th public hearing of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, with testimony by former mayor Rudolph Giuliani, where Giuliani was confronted by activists, and we have the activist and investigative journalist on, Christopher Broder, and he did a great job there.
[02:48:21.815 --> 02:48:29.278]  And then we also, former Staff Sergeant Jimmy Massey who has come out and told the world I killed innocent people for our government.
[02:48:29.298 --> 02:48:30.318]  That was in the second hour.
[02:48:30.358 --> 02:48:34.460]  In the third hour, William Bunch of the Philadelphia Daily News, you just heard that.
[02:48:35.379 --> 02:48:40.483]  And we're going to re-air this interview tonight from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:48:40.583 --> 02:48:41.363]  All these interviews.
[02:48:41.403 --> 02:48:44.905]  So please tell your friends, your neighbors, your family, your email list.
[02:48:45.066 --> 02:48:46.266]  Great broadcast today.
[02:48:46.326 --> 02:48:47.127]  Really informative.
[02:48:47.187 --> 02:48:49.969]  A whole education wrapped into this show today.
[02:48:50.689 --> 02:48:51.990]  All the glory goes to God.
[02:48:52.571 --> 02:48:58.414]  Please tell folks about InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv where they can listen to it tonight when it re-airs.
[02:48:58.454 --> 02:48:59.915]  We'll also repost these at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:49:01.301 --> 02:49:09.746]  And please tune into your local AM or FM affiliate or on the global shortwave from 9 to midnight central time at 3210.
[02:49:10.607 --> 02:49:15.430]  And there's also a couple rebroadcasts of the show over the weekend.
[02:49:16.691 --> 02:49:24.976]  So you'll also be able to catch it then and of course I'll then be back on Monday from 11 to 2 central and back from 9 to midnight.
[02:49:25.156 --> 02:49:29.239]  We've still got a final segment coming up here.
[02:49:29.992 --> 02:49:32.336]  And I just really want to give the callers a response.
[02:49:33.298 --> 02:49:37.825]  I mean, to give the callers a chance to respond because I get their response, I should say.
[02:49:38.987 --> 02:49:41.472]  To all of this that we've discussed, we'll give each caller
[02:49:42.602 --> 02:49:47.904]  About 45 seconds coming up here in the final five-minute segments.
[02:49:47.924 --> 02:49:50.485]  We should be able to jam in about five or six callers.
[02:49:50.905 --> 02:49:52.406]  The total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.

[02:50:29.578 --> 02:50:31.620]  So, the final segment's coming up.
[02:50:31.640 --> 02:50:36.146]  We'll come back and if you wanted to call in or you're on hold there, we'll get to you at 800-259-9231.
[02:50:36.166 --> 02:50:37.487]  A caller blitz straight ahead.
[02:50:47.518 --> 02:50:47.898]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.745 --> 02:51:03.405]  We're good to go!
[02:51:32.282 --> 02:51:35.364]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.524 --> 02:51:41.389]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.287 --> 02:51:46.928]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:51:47.049 --> 02:51:51.192]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:51:51.292 --> 02:51:54.175]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:51:54.255 --> 02:52:00.981]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:52:01.161 --> 02:52:04.163]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:52:04.364 --> 02:52:06.746]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:52:06.886 --> 02:52:11.610]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:52:11.770 --> 02:52:26.362]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:52:26.522 --> 02:52:33.168]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at

[02:52:45.405 --> 02:52:47.028]  What really happened September 11th?
[02:52:47.208 --> 02:52:48.270]  And who stands to gain?
[02:52:48.991 --> 02:52:50.272]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:52:50.492 --> 02:52:56.216]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:52:56.496 --> 02:53:01.760]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:53:02.040 --> 02:53:06.163]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:53:06.383 --> 02:53:10.147]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:53:10.407 --> 02:53:15.051]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:53:15.131 --> 02:53:17.914]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:53:18.214 --> 02:53:21.397]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:53:21.457 --> 02:53:23.279]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:53:23.739 --> 02:53:25.842]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[02:53:37.575 --> 02:53:39.557]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:53:39.797 --> 02:53:41.319]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:53:41.479 --> 02:53:43.582]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:53:51.255 --> 02:54:03.319]  We didn't have a lot of time to take calls today with four guests, but here at the end we've even got some lines up in a rarity at 800-259-9231 if you want to call in with a final comment.
[02:54:03.599 --> 02:54:05.320]  Brad in Colorado, then Gary and others.
[02:54:05.400 --> 02:54:06.160]  Brad, go ahead.
[02:54:06.860 --> 02:54:09.141]  Alex, what a perfect show today.
[02:54:09.241 --> 02:54:10.061]  This was classic.
[02:54:10.682 --> 02:54:12.442]  There is so much information on that.
[02:54:12.522 --> 02:54:17.684]  I am so glad that I recorded it and I can go back and just digest it piece by piece.
[02:54:19.404 --> 02:54:21.946]  I have to admit, this is one of the most powerful shows we've ever done.
[02:54:22.706 --> 02:54:23.747]  Uh, not one of the most.
[02:54:23.827 --> 02:54:26.709]  Probably, it ranks in there with the top three.
[02:54:27.549 --> 02:54:32.613]  And I've been listening to you for, oh, three or four years, and I've been recording at least about the last year of it.
[02:54:33.493 --> 02:54:48.583]  Um, did you get my email that I sent to tips at InfoWard.com about the high school teacher in Albuquerque who was basically harassed out of a contract because his poetry class had people in it
[02:54:49.045 --> 02:54:51.487]  That we're criticizing the great leader.
[02:54:52.328 --> 02:54:54.290]  No, but I see reports like that every day.
[02:54:54.310 --> 02:54:54.990]  When did you send it?
[02:54:55.411 --> 02:54:56.391]  I sent it last night.
[02:54:56.852 --> 02:54:57.332]  Okay.
[02:54:57.893 --> 02:55:00.475]  Frankly, I could only spend like 30 minutes this morning on email.
[02:55:00.575 --> 02:55:02.016]  My wife obviously did see it.
[02:55:02.417 --> 02:55:03.397]  I'll try to post that.
[02:55:03.498 --> 02:55:05.820]  Because that would be another great guest.
[02:55:06.020 --> 02:55:10.684]  Because another thing that in a high school with a military liaison.
[02:55:11.397 --> 02:55:12.818]  Oh, now we've had that for two years.
[02:55:12.858 --> 02:55:15.359]  They're in there to recruit and to get everybody ready.
[02:55:15.560 --> 02:55:17.841]  Well, this was not recruiting.
[02:55:18.261 --> 02:55:26.566]  It was because the principal and the military liaison were part of where the student was chastised.
[02:55:26.926 --> 02:55:33.370]  The teacher was... And yes, they have these political officers at UT.
[02:55:33.410 --> 02:55:36.212]  They have troops running around in plainclothes harassing people.
[02:55:36.492 --> 02:55:38.113]  Wall Street Journal, thanks for the call.
[02:55:38.634 --> 02:55:40.815]  Man, I tell you, this is a scary pattern, folks.
[02:55:41.616 --> 02:55:42.096]  Gary!
[02:55:42.536 --> 02:55:43.236]  In Arizona.
[02:55:43.276 --> 02:55:44.157]  Gary, you're on the air.
[02:55:44.197 --> 02:55:44.657]  Go ahead.
[02:55:45.237 --> 02:55:46.957]  Hey Alex, my name's Barry.
[02:55:47.377 --> 02:55:47.918]  Arizona.
[02:55:48.338 --> 02:55:48.678]  Go ahead.
[02:55:49.478 --> 02:55:52.659]  Yeah, I know you're not Dr. Warr, but help me out here a little bit.
[02:55:52.679 --> 02:55:53.879]  I'm getting a little depressed, man.
[02:55:53.919 --> 02:56:01.781]  I'm trying to have meetings and everything, get people together, because every time I turn the news on, it's martial law, mass detention, so we're going to have to do this and that.
[02:56:02.301 --> 02:56:05.462]  Yeah, they're conditioning us to the next attack, so we'll accept it.
[02:56:05.602 --> 02:56:07.002]  But the people aren't buying it, buddy.
[02:56:07.802 --> 02:56:08.983]  Well, good.
[02:56:09.183 --> 02:56:09.664]  I'm glad.
[02:56:09.804 --> 02:56:14.808]  I mean, people in my community are just kind of like still in denial, but some people are kind of starting to wake up a little bit.
[02:56:15.989 --> 02:56:22.093]  A lot of people who are in denial heard what you had to say, heard what I had to say, heard what countless others had to say.
[02:56:22.113 --> 02:56:23.815]  They're not going to listen until it gets bad for them.
[02:56:24.075 --> 02:56:27.077]  But at that key point, that seed you planted will sprout.
[02:56:27.818 --> 02:56:30.240]  Well, Alex, I just got a really important question here for you.
[02:56:30.260 --> 02:56:31.521]  I mean, I'm interested
[02:56:32.182 --> 02:56:37.746]  In defense of myself and my community, and it looks like they're pushing us toward this physical confrontation.
[02:56:38.147 --> 02:56:40.128]  I don't want that to happen, but what do I do?
[02:56:41.790 --> 02:56:43.491]  Sir, the pen is the mightier than the sword.
[02:56:43.551 --> 02:56:48.815]  You keep getting the word out, keep waking people up, and then you defend yourself and your family physically, if need be, against tyranny.
[02:56:49.515 --> 02:56:51.237]  Yeah, well, that's what I'm working on doing.
[02:56:51.277 --> 02:56:59.223]  I'm showing your videos, I'm organizing groups, and, you know, trying to get things together at the local library, and, you know, but I really appreciate all you do, and, uh,
[02:56:59.844 --> 02:57:02.286]  Keep up the good work, and I'll keep working at it.
[02:57:02.346 --> 02:57:03.727]  And thanks for your support.
[02:57:04.107 --> 02:57:04.847]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:57:04.867 --> 02:57:05.788]  Thanks for your support.
[02:57:05.828 --> 02:57:09.170]  Look, we've got to break past the left-right debate.
[02:57:09.230 --> 02:57:12.813]  We've got to get down to the real nuts and bolts of this, and that's the New World Order.
[02:57:13.833 --> 02:57:15.655]  And you heard the military officer earlier.
[02:57:15.995 --> 02:57:18.477]  He found out we're meant to look bad.
[02:57:18.517 --> 02:57:19.417]  We're meant to abuse.
[02:57:19.457 --> 02:57:20.458]  We're meant to be evil.
[02:57:20.778 --> 02:57:22.339]  And then the UN comes in as the savior.
[02:57:22.899 --> 02:57:24.481]  So the left needs to figure that out.
[02:57:24.581 --> 02:57:27.903]  Michael Moore needs to figure that out, that the UN isn't going to save us.
[02:57:28.638 --> 02:57:31.199]  But that's why he's allowed to do what he's doing and getting all this attention.
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:33.261]  It's just that simple.
[02:57:34.321 --> 02:57:38.303]  My friends, look, you've got to decide what side you're on.
[02:57:39.204 --> 02:57:41.805]  And you've got to have the moral courage to face the facts.
[02:57:42.906 --> 02:57:48.729]  And the military and the police and others out there, you need to join us that love freedom and love liberty.
[02:57:48.769 --> 02:57:54.672]  You need to see the big picture because your global masters will use you as birdcage liner.
[02:57:55.573 --> 02:57:57.494]  They think absolutely nothing of you.
[02:57:59.231 --> 02:58:01.812]  And we're all going to be judged one day before our Creator.
[02:58:02.693 --> 02:58:06.735]  And we're going to be judged on this plane of existence by the evil we all engage in.
[02:58:06.755 --> 02:58:08.035]  That all comes back to haunt us.
[02:58:08.696 --> 02:58:14.518]  When you don't care about your community, when you aren't informed, when you aren't involved fighting corruption, it grows and grows and grows!
[02:58:14.898 --> 02:58:17.019]  And it destroys our way of life and our freedom!
[02:58:17.580 --> 02:58:19.641]  We're going into hell on earth right now!
[02:58:20.501 --> 02:58:26.524]  Because so many of us have just let the government have control and, oh, they won't do any bad, let's go to sleep!
[02:58:27.225 --> 02:58:28.890]  History shows that's a total fraud!
[02:58:29.512 --> 02:58:30.695]  So stop being complacent.
[02:58:30.936 --> 02:58:32.620]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, back on Monday.
[02:58:36.258 --> 02:58:44.880]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:58:45.100 --> 02:58:56.382]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:58:56.582 --> 02:58:59.223]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:58:59.583 --> 02:59:06.045]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:59:06.205 --> 02:59:08.066]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:59:08.266 --> 02:59:14.288]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:59:14.548 --> 02:59:20.210]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:59:20.530 --> 02:59:24.473]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
