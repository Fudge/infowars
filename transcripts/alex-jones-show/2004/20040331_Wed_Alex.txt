[00:00:05.591 --> 00:00:06.251]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:07.953]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:09.774]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:11.255]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.016 --> 00:00:12.917]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.577 --> 00:00:17.281]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:21.845]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:35.557]  Here we are on this live Wednesday edition, the 31st day of March 2004.
[00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:36.278]  We've got
[00:00:45.003 --> 00:00:49.106]  Libertarian presidential candidate, hopeful, he's trying to get the nomination.
[00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:56.290]  Aaron Russo, big Hollywood producer, produced a great TV show called Mad as Hell, exposing the New World Order.
[00:00:56.591 --> 00:01:00.733]  Done a lot of great work, and I agree with his policies and what he's saying.
[00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:03.275]  He's light years better than Ralph Nader.
[00:01:04.287 --> 00:01:14.035]  Light years better than any of the other supposed third-party candidates, and he could certainly get on C-SPAN and educate a lot of people around the country if he gets the nomination.
[00:01:14.715 --> 00:01:21.441]  He's a very interesting, intelligent, informed individual, and he'll be joining us later in the show.
[00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.503]  Well, kind of a repeat of Somalia.
[00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:26.963]  Dead foreigners.
[00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:28.284]  I hope they're not Americans.
[00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:29.944]  I hope we know they're somebody.
[00:01:30.645 --> 00:01:35.386]  Being drugged, dead in the streets, being hoisted, just mutilated horribly.
[00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:39.028]  We have the Reuters and AP photos posted if you want to look at them.
[00:01:40.448 --> 00:01:41.528]  Not for the faint of heart.
[00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:45.270]  On infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:48.875]  But we know that the bomb killed five U.S.
[00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:49.895]  troops in Iraq.
[00:01:49.935 --> 00:01:52.677]  Another six died on Monday.
[00:01:52.757 --> 00:01:54.218]  And several died over the weekend.
[00:01:54.258 --> 00:01:56.040]  And things are accelerating.
[00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.521]  And I think it's horrible.
[00:01:59.062 --> 00:02:02.964]  And our troops are going to be traumatized and turned into police state servants.
[00:02:03.044 --> 00:02:05.966]  And they're going to torture the Iraqis and arrest more of them.
[00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:10.149]  And some towns are devoid of any men over the age of ten.
[00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.052]  They're all at the Halliburton-owned and run FEMA camps.
[00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:16.579]  They own Camp X-Ray, too, in Cuba, by the way.
[00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:19.100]  And then the troops will come back here.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.121]  It's just horrible.
[00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.343]  They're going to come back here and become police officers.
[00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:26.764]  So we'll get into that.
[00:02:26.864 --> 00:02:29.046]  In one of the bloodiest days and weeks for U.S.
[00:02:29.086 --> 00:02:35.709]  military, five troops died when a bomb exploded under their military vehicle west of Baghdad on Wednesday.
[00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.911]  So that's today, but you could really say yesterday for us.
[00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.012]  They're on the other side of the planet.
[00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:47.679]  And, uh, there's just horrible images of dead Westerners hoisted up dead and being drugged through the streets.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.802]  Iraqis dragged bodies through streets after attack.
[00:02:50.842 --> 00:02:59.668]  A crowd of cheering Iraqis has dragged charred and mutilated bodies of a number of foreigners through the streets of Falljala after an attack on two vehicles.
[00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:04.631]  It's not clear how many people were in the vehicles and their nationalities have not yet been established.
[00:03:04.652 --> 00:03:10.676]  The crowd set the two four-wheel drive vehicles ablaze after the attack and threw stones into the burning wreckage.
[00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:20.956]  Television pictures showed one incinerated body being kicked and stamped on by a member of the jubilant crowd, while others dragged a blackened body down the road by its feet.
[00:03:20.996 --> 00:03:27.602]  The footage showed at least three people lying dead, while some witnesses said there were four killed.
[00:03:28.583 --> 00:03:34.308]  The attack came shortly after the United States military said five coalition soldiers were killed in a roadside bomb west of Baghdad.
[00:03:36.227 --> 00:03:40.609]  Also, Fire Strike's third largest refinery in the U.S., down in Houston.
[00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.332]  BP Refinery, and a part of it blew up, and they're saying they don't think it's terrorism.
[00:03:45.772 --> 00:03:52.215]  This a week after the FBI issued alerts thinking terrorists, Al-Cieda, were about to attack.
[00:03:52.235 --> 00:03:52.956]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:57.118]  Fed denies Greenspan had a heart attack.
[00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:58.900]  They deny that rumor.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.907]  Also, more of the different pieces of the puzzle with the stand-down order for NORAD on 9-11 to not intercept those aircraft.
[00:04:08.108 --> 00:04:16.515]  Turns out, just months before 9-11, they changed the rules, magically, where the generals couldn't order the shoot-downs themselves as they could do in the past.
[00:04:18.276 --> 00:04:20.198]  All very convenient, as usual.
[00:04:20.258 --> 00:04:21.539]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.522]  Terror panic could turn Britain into a police state, says Kennedy.
[00:04:25.982 --> 00:04:26.583]  Charles Kennedy,
[00:04:27.505 --> 00:04:53.187]  commented panic measures to protect Britain from terrorism yesterday said David Blunkett has stripped people of hard-earned freedoms and elder Bush starts crying saying leave my son alone leave the president alone the big war chief he just don't mean what you're saying about him of course Barbara Bush last year threatened Democratic presidential candidates
[00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:55.472]  With their lives on CNN.
[00:04:55.532 --> 00:04:57.312]  By the way, we'll go back over that.
[00:04:57.993 --> 00:04:59.093]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.113 --> 00:04:59.513]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.254 --> 00:05:03.675]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower.
[00:05:03.755 --> 00:05:06.776]  And most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:05:07.016 --> 00:05:09.917]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato.
[00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:12.598]  And watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.159]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.360]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.402]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses
[00:05:21.662 --> 00:05:26.425]  Artificially ripened with gas could be grown much quicker fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:36.211]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:05:36.411 --> 00:05:45.557]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.

[00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:05.113]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:08.061]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.782 --> 00:08:09.902]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.542 --> 00:08:11.362]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.123 --> 00:08:13.023]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.043 --> 00:08:17.424]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:21.986]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:25.207]  That's right, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:25.407 --> 00:08:26.107]  I love freedom.
[00:08:26.227 --> 00:08:27.027]  I hate tyranny.
[00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:29.928]  We have Libertarian presidential candidate.
[00:08:31.042 --> 00:08:34.124]  Aaron Russo, great guy, big Hollywood producer.
[00:08:35.486 --> 00:08:36.506]  Anti-New World Order.
[00:08:37.467 --> 00:08:42.351]  Coming on the show, here in about 53 minutes.
[00:08:43.552 --> 00:08:47.034]  Now 8 minutes after the hour, into this first hour.
[00:08:47.054 --> 00:08:53.039]  And we'll get into the bomb, kills 5 US troops, other Westerners being killed.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.722]  We'll get into the bodies being drug around, how horrible this is.
[00:08:57.994 --> 00:09:02.138]  We'll also get into the fire-striking third largest refinery in the U.S.
[00:09:02.178 --> 00:09:03.819]  Gas prices exploding even further.
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:09.104]  Also, they're denying that Alan Greenspan had a heart attack.
[00:09:09.544 --> 00:09:15.329]  We'll get into new 9-11 stand-down order information surfacing.
[00:09:15.369 --> 00:09:18.051]  That's on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:25.938]  But I wanted to cover Neocon Radio just for a few minutes because they're not real conservatives.
[00:09:26.744 --> 00:09:37.414]  They're there to pacify you, to make you think that you've got a voice, to make you think that the Republicans are good, when in truth they're like the Democrats on steroids.
[00:09:38.955 --> 00:09:45.000]  They're a Trojan horse, a wolf in sheep's clothing, a Benedict Arnold, a Judas Iscariot.
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.943]  I mean, what other examples do I have to use here?
[00:09:50.554 --> 00:10:11.265]  And listening to Neocon Radio, it's sweatshops aren't bad, open borders really isn't bad, NAFTA and GATT are good, and Free Trade Area of America is good, and those that criticize the loss in jobs, well they're just lazy bums, and Bush is giving us the American Dream, or really getting rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:10:12.326 --> 00:10:13.106]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:17.750]  I mean, there is a global policy to de-industrialize this country.
[00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:18.891]  It's been publicly stated.
[00:10:18.951 --> 00:10:20.151]  It's in their own white papers.
[00:10:21.152 --> 00:10:23.332]  They are accelerating our job losses.
[00:10:23.352 --> 00:10:27.654]  They allow other countries to have high tariffs on us, and then we don't have tariffs on them.
[00:10:27.994 --> 00:10:31.595]  China, on average, with a 42% tariff on us.
[00:10:31.615 --> 00:10:34.856]  We've got, what, about a 2.4% on them on average goods.
[00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:36.517]  I mean, it's out of control!
[00:10:37.654 --> 00:10:40.616]  It's designed to get rid of our jobs, and they've said it is!
[00:10:41.117 --> 00:10:49.783]  But now you're a liberal putting down America who's lazy, and then the hostile lad, well, I know a lot of you are out of work and it's tough, but still, it's America.
[00:10:49.823 --> 00:10:51.064]  Don't criticize America.
[00:10:51.345 --> 00:10:52.766]  We're not criticizing America.
[00:10:53.406 --> 00:11:01.973]  America was a country of incredible wealth because we had low taxes, low regulation, and we had tariffs.
[00:11:04.224 --> 00:11:06.665]  That's what built this country!
[00:11:07.025 --> 00:11:10.686]  And they told you napkin gout would mean milk and honey, and it's not true!
[00:11:11.026 --> 00:11:13.226]  And they give you all these fake job numbers.
[00:11:13.286 --> 00:11:15.387]  I heard the neocons all over talk radio this morning.
[00:11:16.307 --> 00:11:24.269]  They're reading off the script, people, about, oh, the jobs are really great, and we've really got low unemployment, and everything's wonderful, and don't listen to the liberals.
[00:11:24.909 --> 00:11:27.730]  Well, if we weren't listening to the liberals, we wouldn't be listening to you, then!
[00:11:29.286 --> 00:11:35.030]  But then, I mean, all over TV and the radio, emotional elder Bush attacks son's critics.
[00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:48.498]  I mean, folks, imagine if my daddy, when the New York Times attacked me or some major TV show attacked me, which has happened many times, imagine if my daddy ran out to the press and said, don't attack my son!
[00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:51.600]  Much less the president's daddy!
[00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:57.005]  You know, Dr. Evil says, leave many me alone.
[00:11:58.146 --> 00:12:03.750]  We're holding the country ransom for eighty-seven billion dollars.
[00:12:05.432 --> 00:12:09.915]  I mean, they're bombing all these countries, got our troops all over the place being killed.
[00:12:11.096 --> 00:12:14.579]  Bush is making jokes about, where are the weapons of mass destruction?
[00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:16.440]  Not under my desk, not under my bed.
[00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:18.022]  Ha ha ha, it's funny.
[00:12:18.695 --> 00:12:29.983]  Britt Hume, by the way, on Fox News Sunday, and I got the transcripts, told everybody, including, he said, the families of troops that have died, to just get over Bush's joke.
[00:12:30.023 --> 00:12:31.384]  Just get over it!
[00:12:31.404 --> 00:12:33.805]  Imagine if he lost family over there.
[00:12:34.126 --> 00:12:37.068]  Imagine him going, just get over it!
[00:12:38.529 --> 00:12:41.251]  How dare you liberals criticize Bush's jokes!
[00:12:41.491 --> 00:12:44.193]  The guy joked about the first plane flying into the tower.
[00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:45.493]  Oh, that's a bad pilot!
[00:12:45.513 --> 00:12:45.994]  Ha ha ha!
[00:12:47.409 --> 00:12:50.831]  And they were going to execute a woman in Texas that even conservatives didn't want executed.
[00:12:51.051 --> 00:12:54.393]  He got up on TV and said, she begged me, she said, please don't kill me.
[00:12:54.713 --> 00:12:55.574]  Please don't kill me.
[00:12:56.294 --> 00:12:57.955]  Don't joke about this stuff.
[00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:01.097]  Even if you're for the death penalty, which I happen to be for.
[00:13:01.757 --> 00:13:05.900]  If we didn't have a corrupt government, caught framing people coast to coast.
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:06.160]  See?
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:07.721]  You can't trust them.
[00:13:08.001 --> 00:13:09.282]  That's the problem.
[00:13:09.482 --> 00:13:11.203]  And they've executed a lot of innocent people.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:28.765]  So emotional Elder Bush attacked Suns critics, this is from Reuters, an emotional former president, George Herbert Walker, skull and bones, former CIA director, head UN ambassador, thought I'd add that, on Tuesday defended his son's Iraq war and lashed out at White House critics.
[00:13:29.886 --> 00:13:38.929]  It is deeply offensive and contemptible to hear elites, oh, see it's always, they're fighting the elites, oh sure,
[00:13:40.137 --> 00:13:49.764]  Elites and intellectuals on the campaign trail dismissed progress in Iraq since last year's overthrow of Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein.
[00:13:51.605 --> 00:14:00.832]  The elder Bush said in a speech to the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association annual convention, there is something
[00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:15.184]  Ignorant in the way they dismissed the overthrow of a brutal dictator, my former business partner that I transferred weapons to, I mean, and the sowing of seeds of basic human freedom in the troubled part of the world, he said.
[00:14:16.025 --> 00:14:26.995]  The former president appeared to fight back tears as he complained about media coverage of his younger Bush that he called something sort of far
[00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:28.935]  Fair and unbalanced.
[00:14:28.955 --> 00:14:30.976]  He said it's something short of fair and balanced.
[00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:33.077]  Oh, a Fox News quibble.
[00:14:34.317 --> 00:14:35.097]  And it goes on.
[00:14:35.357 --> 00:14:47.341]  It hurts, he said, an awful lot more when it's your son that is being criticized than when they used to get all over my case, said the read-my-lips-no-new-taxes-UN-worshipper-who-called-for-a-new-world-order.
[00:14:47.421 --> 00:14:52.702]  I mean, said Bush, who has often complained about media coverage of both Bush presidencies.
[00:14:54.623 --> 00:14:54.903]  Okay.
[00:14:55.363 --> 00:14:56.404]  I thought I'd read what his wife
[00:14:58.846 --> 00:15:04.311]  Barbara Bush had to say last year on CNN, on Larry King Live, we have the video of this by the way.
[00:15:05.531 --> 00:15:08.033]  Barbara Bush threatens Democratic presidential candidates.
[00:15:08.394 --> 00:15:17.161]  Barbara Bush, quote, you can criticize me, but don't criticize my children, and don't criticize my daughters-in-law, and don't criticize my husband or your dad.
[00:15:18.182 --> 00:15:20.203]  I take that serious from these kingpins.
[00:15:20.644 --> 00:15:23.626]  That's like when John Gotti says something like that, look out!
[00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:29.313]  You know, Al Capone, I mean, they're street thugs compared to this dynasty.
[00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:35.976]  So, we've got the transcript up there on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:35.996 --> 00:15:42.159]  We've reposted this story, and here is, Barbara Bush threatens Democratic presidential candidates.
[00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:48.041]  And she went on to say that, you know, don't talk about my family or you're dead.
[00:15:48.061 --> 00:15:54.004]  You could say that's a figure of speech, but if somebody said that about government officials, they'd be arrested.
[00:15:55.521 --> 00:16:04.325]  But when the government says it, or when a duchess like herself says it, you know, we're supposed to sit here and just accept it.
[00:16:06.426 --> 00:16:07.466]  It's sick, people!
[00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:16.710]  I mean, whining about the population responding in anger, including a lot of Republicans, by Bush making jokes about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.470]  Where are they?
[00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:17.970]  Not here!
[00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.951]  They're sure not there!
[00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:20.291]  Ha ha ha!
[00:16:20.632 --> 00:16:21.472]  You're a liar!
[00:16:21.812 --> 00:16:35.597]  Who took this country into a war against your business partner, and your own energy commission said it was about oil, and your own PNAC document said it was about oil, and you fabricated all that evidence, and you lied in your State of the Union on purpose!
[00:16:35.917 --> 00:16:37.038]  And we're sick of it!
[00:16:37.338 --> 00:16:40.339]  We're sick of you and Bill Clinton and all your other buddies!
[00:16:41.619 --> 00:16:42.540]  By the way, Bush Sr.
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:45.781]  met 11 times with Bill Clinton before they ran for the presidency.
[00:16:47.532 --> 00:16:48.473]  And that's just a fact.
[00:16:48.493 --> 00:16:50.074]  They went to Bilderberg Group meetings together.
[00:16:50.114 --> 00:16:50.995]  It's totally staged.
[00:16:51.075 --> 00:16:52.656]  It's WWF wrestling.
[00:16:52.916 --> 00:16:54.117]  It's good cop, bad cop.
[00:16:54.177 --> 00:16:54.797]  Wake up to it.
[00:16:56.798 --> 00:17:08.426]  So, it's disgusting to have this type of quote to have her come out and threatening people.
[00:17:09.227 --> 00:17:14.831]  She said, she said, it's horrible about people knocking my precious, courageous, brilliant son
[00:17:16.863 --> 00:17:20.184]  And then she went on to say, don't talk about my family or you're dead.
[00:17:21.585 --> 00:17:23.305]  You're dead, she said.
[00:17:23.706 --> 00:17:30.528]  You can criticize me, but don't criticize my children, and don't criticize my daughters-in-law, and don't criticize my husband.
[00:17:33.849 --> 00:17:41.632]  And then she goes on to say, don't talk about them, what they're going to do by knocking my precious, courageous, brilliant son.
[00:17:43.493 --> 00:17:45.674]  Your courageous, brilliant,
[00:17:47.245 --> 00:17:49.506]  Son, I mean, just please!
[00:17:50.207 --> 00:17:56.130]  So next time somebody criticizes me, next time Sean Hannity talks about me or something, I'll just have my daddy on the show.
[00:17:56.471 --> 00:18:01.894]  He'll come on the show and start crying and he'll go, he'll say, Don't talk about my son!
[00:18:02.494 --> 00:18:05.356]  Don't talk about him in the political arena!
[00:18:05.396 --> 00:18:09.378]  You're not supposed to do that!
[00:18:09.939 --> 00:18:11.800]  I mean, just disgusting!
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:13.241]  Disgusting!
[00:18:13.261 --> 00:18:15.102]  These people are sick!
[00:18:16.864 --> 00:18:19.705]  Oh, you're like, well, are you for John Forbes, Kerry?
[00:18:19.725 --> 00:18:28.028]  Of course I'm not for Bush's cousin and skull and bones, pod mate, coffin mate, skeleton mate, a leech!
[00:18:28.529 --> 00:18:34.791]  And Brit Hume, Fox News pundit Brit Hume tells families of dead American soldiers, just get over it!
[00:18:35.973 --> 00:18:36.594]  Got that article?
[00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:37.855]  Just get over it!
[00:18:38.275 --> 00:18:38.715]  All of you!
[00:18:38.755 --> 00:18:40.277]  Just get over losing your jobs!
[00:18:40.737 --> 00:18:42.439]  Get over us coming after your guns!
[00:18:42.719 --> 00:18:47.483]  Get over us selling out your sovereignty and signing on to UNESCO and campaign finance reform!
[00:18:47.663 --> 00:18:48.424]  Just get over it!
[00:18:48.584 --> 00:18:49.164]  Shut up!
[00:18:49.445 --> 00:18:55.169]  And love the new neocon-conservatism of the government doubling its growth that we had under Bill Clinton.
[00:18:56.591 --> 00:19:01.035]  Because that's now the new conservatism.
[00:19:01.815 --> 00:19:02.516]  You see, I'm
[00:19:03.294 --> 00:19:09.795]  I don't have an allegiance to the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the First Amendment, and to this country, God and country.
[00:19:09.995 --> 00:19:11.456]  God comes first, then country.
[00:19:11.736 --> 00:19:26.599]  I don't have an allegiance to a stuttering, sputtering, East Coast blueblood who has a Hollywood set set up miles from my home where he struts around in a cowboy hat, people!
[00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:28.639]  I'm sick of it!
[00:19:29.688 --> 00:19:30.668]  It's all fake!
[00:19:30.768 --> 00:19:33.109]  It's Shakespearean fraud!
[00:19:35.729 --> 00:19:38.550]  Woe to you that buy all this propaganda!
[00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:40.830]  What do you think about it?
[00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:43.751]  Anytime I get criticized, I'm bringing my daddy on.
[00:19:44.471 --> 00:19:45.591]  Talk about my son.
[00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:47.772]  He's such a genius.
[00:19:49.192 --> 00:19:51.352]  It's wrong what you're doing.
[00:19:52.153 --> 00:19:55.613]  Don't want to be putting himself out there and stole an election and did all this.
[00:19:56.113 --> 00:19:57.734]  You don't talk bad about him.
[00:19:57.774 --> 00:19:58.474]  It's mean!
[00:20:01.292 --> 00:20:09.900]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:21.411]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:20:21.631 --> 00:20:24.274]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:24.614 --> 00:20:31.060]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:33.101]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:20:33.302 --> 00:20:39.327]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:20:39.567 --> 00:20:45.232]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:03.871]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[00:21:03.932 --> 00:21:05.633]  Well right now, don't wait!

[00:21:55.606 --> 00:22:05.311]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:22:05.731 --> 00:22:11.154]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:22:11.614 --> 00:22:12.675]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:22:12.735 --> 00:22:16.717]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:22:17.424 --> 00:22:30.707]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:31.227 --> 00:22:36.529]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:36.829 --> 00:22:42.710]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:23:09.152 --> 00:23:13.395]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:23:13.635 --> 00:23:20.660]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:23:21.041 --> 00:23:27.165]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:27.305 --> 00:23:28.506]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:28.846 --> 00:23:31.809]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:23:31.949 --> 00:23:33.971]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.

[00:23:49.123 --> 00:23:50.084]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.

[00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:30.577]  Coming up, puncture wounds found on Terry Shivo Schindler's arm.
[00:24:31.958 --> 00:24:34.920]  Attempted murder is the headline with a question mark.
[00:24:36.321 --> 00:24:37.842]  We'll get into that.
[00:24:37.882 --> 00:24:43.506]  You know, she's the lady that they've been wanting to unplug even though she can mumble and open her eyes and smile at her parents.
[00:24:44.341 --> 00:24:45.181]  He's not brain-dead.
[00:24:45.261 --> 00:24:47.842]  They claim she was a vegetable but in a coma now.
[00:24:47.902 --> 00:24:49.283]  She's in a vegetative state.
[00:24:49.343 --> 00:24:49.723]  Oh, now.
[00:24:50.183 --> 00:24:51.504]  Well, she's not having a good life.
[00:24:51.544 --> 00:24:52.124]  Let's kill her.
[00:24:54.004 --> 00:24:55.385]  That's what they're saying, so we'll get into that.
[00:24:55.465 --> 00:24:56.725]  Also, Stasi London.
[00:24:57.146 --> 00:24:57.926]  Fear-mongering.
[00:24:58.586 --> 00:25:00.487]  Reaches new heights in England.
[00:25:02.067 --> 00:25:08.730]  Also, how revealing is an x-ray scanner that they're putting in lots of the airports now where you're totally naked when you walk through it.
[00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:12.191]  Dutch Public Library has deployed Big Brother RFID
[00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:20.715]  Cracker chips will get into the dead bodies being drug around and hung up in Iraq, and more soldiers dying every day.
[00:25:22.817 --> 00:25:27.600]  That's just some of what is coming up here on the show today.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:36.006]  And again, Aaron Russo, Libertarian presidential candidate, hopeful, former Hollywood, still, I guess, Hollywood producer, and a riveting guy.
[00:25:36.066 --> 00:25:36.766]  So that's coming up.
[00:25:36.786 --> 00:25:37.867]  You don't want to miss that either.
[00:25:37.887 --> 00:25:40.329]  But my last point about
[00:25:41.414 --> 00:25:41.955]  Bush Sr.
[00:25:41.995 --> 00:25:46.378]  choking back tears at a speech about people talking bad about his son and how angry it makes him.
[00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:51.702]  His son's out making jokes about missing weapons of mass destruction when almost 600 troops are dead.
[00:25:52.662 --> 00:25:54.744]  He's making jokes about planes flying into buildings.
[00:25:55.484 --> 00:25:59.147]  And he's attacking people all over the place through his surrogates.
[00:25:59.948 --> 00:26:05.111]  And we're at hemes telling that victims of the dead soldiers get over it on Fox News.
[00:26:05.712 --> 00:26:08.614]  And then the most powerful puppet in the world,
[00:26:09.631 --> 00:26:16.253]  With all this power and control in the military, his daddy's going out and his mommy's going out saying, don't talk about my baby.
[00:26:17.753 --> 00:26:18.594]  It's really sick.
[00:26:19.894 --> 00:26:23.515]  These wolves, though, don't like you talking about their cubs as they feed on you.
[00:26:24.315 --> 00:26:26.396]  Why don't you talk back as we chew your guts out?
[00:26:27.196 --> 00:26:29.177]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[00:26:29.217 --> 00:26:29.917]  Chris, go ahead.
[00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:34.979]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:26:35.019 --> 00:26:36.019]  We'll bring you up on air now.
[00:26:37.539 --> 00:26:38.680]  Okay, we don't have that caller.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:39.260]  Guys?
[00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:40.431]  All right.
[00:26:41.411 --> 00:26:42.652]  Let's talk to Tim in Illinois.
[00:26:42.692 --> 00:26:43.332]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:26:46.313 --> 00:26:51.534]  Okay, I guess we're going to be unable to go to calls right now, but we'll try that later.
[00:26:51.754 --> 00:27:01.296]  We'll find out exactly what's going on here and get to your calls here on the show.
[00:27:01.376 --> 00:27:02.537]  Scott, are you there?
[00:27:02.557 --> 00:27:05.157]  Yeah, let's go to those.
[00:27:05.797 --> 00:27:07.078]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[00:27:07.118 --> 00:27:07.738]  Go ahead, Chris.
[00:27:10.302 --> 00:27:11.483]  Okay.
[00:27:12.804 --> 00:27:13.644]  Chris, you there, buddy?
[00:27:13.864 --> 00:27:14.845]  Yes, I am here, Alex.
[00:27:14.865 --> 00:27:15.846]  Wow, we got you on.
[00:27:15.886 --> 00:27:16.586]  This is amazing.
[00:27:16.606 --> 00:27:17.006]  Go ahead.
[00:27:17.827 --> 00:27:20.589]  I just wanted to bring two things to your attention.
[00:27:21.609 --> 00:27:26.713]  First of all, UPS is doing a real good job delivering your videos, since it's not the Postal Service.
[00:27:27.213 --> 00:27:27.753]  That's right.
[00:27:27.793 --> 00:27:31.356]  We shifted to UPS about three weeks ago, and they're awesome.
[00:27:31.656 --> 00:27:36.279]  Yep, I ordered some stuff on the 24th, it shipped out on the 25th, and I received it today.
[00:27:37.515 --> 00:27:52.889]  Well, you know, at the Post Office, we would use priority mail, and then we found out that media mail went as fast as priority mail, and you paid about a third as much, and we tested it out, and we would ship stuff to people I knew in Austin.
[00:27:53.189 --> 00:27:57.353]  It would take a week or two, and then somebody in New York would get the videos in three days.
[00:27:57.433 --> 00:27:59.675]  So, the Postal Service is a complete joke.
[00:27:59.895 --> 00:28:01.216]  Apparently so.
[00:28:01.236 --> 00:28:03.438]  I did want to bring one other thing to your attention.
[00:28:04.611 --> 00:28:16.456]  I was sitting in the New World Order chat room on FNET, and we were discussing this new secret organization that apparently Daddy Bush is in, the Global Leadership Foundation.
[00:28:16.476 --> 00:28:17.497]  Do you know anything about that?
[00:28:17.737 --> 00:28:18.917]  I have read about that, yeah.
[00:28:19.338 --> 00:28:21.398]  Can you explain that to us?
[00:28:21.458 --> 00:28:24.840]  I'll get off, but I would like to hear you elaborate on it a little bit.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.020]  Alright, well thank you.
[00:28:26.581 --> 00:28:27.601]  I don't know much about it.
[00:28:28.962 --> 00:28:30.963]  There are dozens and dozens of major groups.
[00:28:31.023 --> 00:28:31.503]  The big ones
[00:28:32.162 --> 00:28:50.030]  Are the Trilateral Commission, CFR, Royal Institute of International Affairs, Bilderberg Group, and the people that are in those organizations are the bank chairman, and the World Bank heads, and the head of the World Health Organization, and the heads of the major universities, and most of the big anchors on the nightly news.
[00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:55.652]  Basically, the elite of every facet of society.
[00:28:56.992 --> 00:29:00.614]  And that's the situation that we're looking at.
[00:29:01.415 --> 00:29:06.118]  And, you know, they've got the World Federalist Society and all these other groups, the Committee of 300.
[00:29:06.959 --> 00:29:11.642]  And it's really just a couple thousand people that are members of all these organizations.
[00:29:11.842 --> 00:29:15.225]  And different councils are over different areas of the economy.
[00:29:16.185 --> 00:29:24.151]  Whereas the Trilateral Commission is more into banking and studying global economic systems.
[00:29:25.089 --> 00:29:34.195]  Then the CFR is larger and is over more strata of society, whereas Bilderberg Group is mainly over Western Europe and is allied with England and the U.S.
[00:29:34.395 --> 00:29:41.420]  So they're all just different globalist bodies, but their policies, what they're pushing for, is basically all the same.
[00:29:42.261 --> 00:29:45.943]  Okay, we'll come back, go to more of your calls, and get to more of this news.
[00:29:46.383 --> 00:29:47.804]  I'm Alex Jones, please stay with us.
[00:29:51.547 --> 00:29:54.649]  We're on the march, the impulse...
[00:29:55.436 --> 00:29:58.198]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:54.028 --> 00:30:57.769]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:58.369 --> 00:30:59.769]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:31:01.469 --> 00:31:03.830]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:07.910]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:09.051]  Read the labels.
[00:31:09.491 --> 00:31:13.631]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:18.012]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:31:18.392 --> 00:31:23.253]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:31:23.653 --> 00:31:27.196]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:31:27.416 --> 00:31:32.760]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:35.762]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:31:36.062 --> 00:31:36.963]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:32:01.357 --> 00:32:02.358]  It's finally here!
[00:32:02.498 --> 00:32:03.458]  Spring has arrived!
[00:32:03.658 --> 00:32:06.619]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:10.301]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:32:10.501 --> 00:32:18.665]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:32:18.925 --> 00:32:22.667]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[00:32:54.686 --> 00:32:57.947]  Alright, let's get five of these calls out of the way quickly.
[00:32:57.967 --> 00:32:59.148]  Always enjoy your calls.
[00:33:12.136 --> 00:33:16.860]  But I'm going straight into news, and then Aaron Russo, Libertarian candidate for President.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.181]  Great guys coming on the show.
[00:33:19.081 --> 00:33:20.462]  Let's talk to Tim in Illinois.
[00:33:20.522 --> 00:33:21.203]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:33:21.643 --> 00:33:22.104]  Hi, Alex.
[00:33:22.124 --> 00:33:22.464]  How are you?
[00:33:22.904 --> 00:33:23.465]  Good, my friend.
[00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:25.566]  I just got some information for you.
[00:33:25.586 --> 00:33:26.367]  It won't take long.
[00:33:26.587 --> 00:33:30.770]  I live, you've got to understand, I live in the heart of neocon land here, where it's very hard to convey.
[00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:35.033]  Where gun control, open borders, and regulation is conservative.
[00:33:35.314 --> 00:33:37.896]  And your videos are kind of a hard sell, too.
[00:33:37.916 --> 00:33:40.978]  But I found a way to make them work, and this is just for your information.
[00:33:42.113 --> 00:33:44.816]  You have to show them the collapse of Building 7 first.
[00:33:46.037 --> 00:33:58.949]  I had to splice in the clip from at the end of Police Stage 3 with Dan Rather, and then go into about 8 minutes of Eric Humschmidt's movie, where he actually shows the aerial view, where the buildings were.
[00:33:58.969 --> 00:33:59.990]  Nobody really knows that.
[00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:04.411]  Everybody thinks building 7 was the little hotel that the stuff fell on.
[00:34:04.511 --> 00:34:05.351]  You know, nobody knows.
[00:34:05.391 --> 00:34:08.292]  No, it was a 47 story building that caught fire that afternoon.
[00:34:08.512 --> 00:34:08.732]  Right.
[00:34:08.912 --> 00:34:12.213]  And then magically imploded and the seismographs picked up explosions.
[00:34:12.233 --> 00:34:13.714]  The firefighters said there were bombs.
[00:34:14.194 --> 00:34:17.435]  And then we have the owner on national television saying they blew it up.
[00:34:17.915 --> 00:34:18.435]  Exactly.
[00:34:19.216 --> 00:34:23.697]  And then, especially that second view that Eric shows in his film, you could really see the penthouse come down.
[00:34:23.737 --> 00:34:25.277]  I mean, there's no contest.
[00:34:25.337 --> 00:34:27.258]  Everybody knows it was demolished when they see that.
[00:34:28.004 --> 00:34:32.647]  And then that makes everybody, you could see the fear set in in their expressions and everything.
[00:34:32.727 --> 00:34:40.331]  We have a clip of the firefighters, not just their quotes from the newspapers, but a video clip that went out live on TV where they're saying, man did you see those bombs?
[00:34:40.431 --> 00:34:42.513]  Boom, boom, boom, boom, whoa!
[00:34:43.193 --> 00:34:45.494]  And later they got told, you didn't see any of that, buddy.
[00:34:46.275 --> 00:34:46.555]  So anyway.
[00:34:46.575 --> 00:34:51.798]  And I called some of those firefighters, and they're just like, Mr. Jones, I have a family, I've been told to shut up, I gotta go.
[00:34:52.959 --> 00:34:54.480]  Right, you know, it's true.
[00:34:55.356 --> 00:35:00.080]  But that's been the most effective way it's getting people to open up.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:06.464]  I showed it to a small audience at U of I, and that totally scorned me a month earlier.
[00:35:06.484 --> 00:35:09.567]  And then when I had this at the beginning, nobody left.
[00:35:11.508 --> 00:35:12.869]  Well, sounds like you're doing a good job.
[00:35:12.909 --> 00:35:14.070]  What else is on your mind?
[00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:21.035]  Well, just for your information, if you've got any more films coming out, I know you're busy, you might concentrate more on Building 7, at least for 10-15 minutes.
[00:35:22.401 --> 00:35:24.343]  You know, you get some real structural engineering.
[00:35:24.363 --> 00:35:26.885]  We get into Building 7 briefly and 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[00:35:27.185 --> 00:35:27.785]  Briefly, though.
[00:35:27.986 --> 00:35:28.846]  We get into it in the middle.
[00:35:28.866 --> 00:35:32.209]  We get into it a little bit more in the... Right.
[00:35:32.489 --> 00:35:33.990]  I know all your films, but I'm just telling you.
[00:35:34.031 --> 00:35:35.352]  And then we get into it more in Police State 3.
[00:35:35.632 --> 00:35:42.778]  With some of these non-believer, neocon, hardcore people, you can talk about documents, W1999 and all that stuff as much as you want.
[00:35:42.798 --> 00:35:43.698]  They're never going to listen.
[00:35:43.718 --> 00:35:45.400]  But when they actually see something like that,
[00:35:46.252 --> 00:35:47.092]  They can't refute it.
[00:35:47.272 --> 00:35:51.294]  I'll tell you, the new advanced socialists, it's like the Terminator, it just gets more powerful, better.
[00:35:51.734 --> 00:35:53.374]  They're socialists and don't even know it.
[00:35:53.394 --> 00:36:01.917]  I mean, that's mind control, when all these so-called conservatives are the biggest anti-American, big government pimps ever, and they don't even know it.
[00:36:02.277 --> 00:36:03.238]  That's a powerful enemy.
[00:36:03.278 --> 00:36:03.858]  Thanks for the call.
[00:36:04.338 --> 00:36:05.438]  And I appreciate your work, Tim.
[00:36:05.979 --> 00:36:06.859]  Bob in Texas.
[00:36:06.919 --> 00:36:07.639]  Bob, go ahead.
[00:36:08.259 --> 00:36:09.320]  Yes, Alex.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.740]  I'm enjoying your show.
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:11.680]  Well, thank you.
[00:36:12.721 --> 00:36:13.401]  I had a question.
[00:36:15.171 --> 00:36:20.213]  Why can't we all organize and get somebody to run for president?
[00:36:20.634 --> 00:36:22.034]  Well, I've said this a million times.
[00:36:22.874 --> 00:36:39.801]  Why can't we just pick out somebody, you, John Stuttmiller, somebody and just support him with everything that we have, I mean all your listeners and everybody, and just get them on the agenda and get going with it.
[00:36:40.202 --> 00:36:40.982]  Why can't we do that?
[00:36:41.102 --> 00:36:43.003]  Why can't we get just a regular...
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.881]  The President doesn't run anything.
[00:36:52.921 --> 00:37:03.351]  We talk a lot about Bill Clinton and George Bush and George Herbert Walker because they're the puppets, they're the titular head of this thing, the figureheads, so people have to identify with that as the power structure.
[00:37:03.411 --> 00:37:09.317]  Now look, the military industrial complex owned by the big banks owns and runs the federal government now.
[00:37:09.853 --> 00:37:16.877]  The power, the last place we've got to reverse this is at the county, city, state level, regional level.
[00:37:17.458 --> 00:37:21.900]  That's where you can actually get something done if we can beat the electronic CIA-run voting machines.
[00:37:22.601 --> 00:37:22.961]  Okay?
[00:37:23.981 --> 00:37:26.763]  Now, the two-party system's already got it fixed, number one.
[00:37:27.504 --> 00:37:33.147]  Number two, again, the real power is at the local level through the Tenth Amendment.
[00:37:33.832 --> 00:37:39.297]  And it's about educating people down at the grassroots playing.
[00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:43.080]  And this is so important.
[00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:51.767]  You know, we have this Hollywood image of the hero coming in, the Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Sylvester Stallone archetype, devastating the enemy.
[00:37:51.787 --> 00:37:58.773]  And then, oh, our champion has taken the field and won for us with our banner.
[00:37:59.426 --> 00:38:01.327]  Whereas, in truth, it's a process.
[00:38:01.447 --> 00:38:13.430]  We became decadent over hundreds of years, and now we're going into the depths of a decadent cycle, and we've got to, one mind, one soul, one heart at a time, change America and the world that way.
[00:38:14.130 --> 00:38:20.512]  I mean, look, 80 plus percent of the American people are against open borders, but the Republicans and Democrats together, they don't want that.
[00:38:21.452 --> 00:38:28.614]  You know, most Americans are against gun control, plus it's the Bill of Rights, but we don't see that reversed because the NRA is a Trojan horse group.
[00:38:29.292 --> 00:38:33.515]  So, I mean, I'm all for Aaron Russo running as a Libertarian for President, and I support him.
[00:38:33.835 --> 00:38:34.755]  I think he's a great guy.
[00:38:35.336 --> 00:38:41.820]  But, really, he's there just to be an educator, and to be part of the debate, to galvanize people.
[00:38:43.481 --> 00:38:50.605]  Look, we could have a President in power, and the bureaucracies, the legislative, the judicial will just ignore him.
[00:38:52.847 --> 00:38:57.650]  What I was thinking about is, if you could just get somebody that we know,
[00:38:58.769 --> 00:38:59.150]  I think so.
[00:39:09.474 --> 00:39:10.935]  Best thing for America.
[00:39:10.995 --> 00:39:12.716]  If they could just do that... No, I understand.
[00:39:12.736 --> 00:39:19.059]  That would be wonderful in a perfect world, but what I'm telling you is if we had a real president, they would get the Dealey Plaza treatment.
[00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:19.639]  Right.
[00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:25.062]  Hey, listen, I appreciate your call, and I understand that instinctive need if we just had a chieftain, if we just had a leader.
[00:39:25.422 --> 00:39:26.202]  You're the leader.
[00:39:26.262 --> 00:39:27.523]  The power lies with you.
[00:39:27.823 --> 00:39:29.524]  The solution lies with you, my friend.
[00:39:29.924 --> 00:39:31.064]  Bob in Texas, go ahead.
[00:39:35.006 --> 00:39:35.787]  Yeah, go ahead, Bob.
[00:39:35.827 --> 00:39:36.387]  You're on the air.
[00:39:37.139 --> 00:39:37.819]  Hey, Bob's gone.
[00:39:37.839 --> 00:39:38.500]  Ken in Texas.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.180]  Ken, go ahead.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:46.302]  Yeah, hey, there's going to be a 10th Amendment rally in Dallas, Dallas Convention Center this Saturday with Judge Roy Moore and Ellen Keys.
[00:39:46.322 --> 00:39:49.784]  You can contact them at www.texasrallies.us.
[00:39:51.383 --> 00:39:54.765]  Go for your number, 1-877-332-3911.
[00:39:54.785 --> 00:40:00.689]  You know, I don't mind plugs, Ken, but talk about some of the issues we've discussed first.
[00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:02.150]  I mean, you know, join in with us.
[00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:03.631]  Okay, here's the question of the day.
[00:40:03.871 --> 00:40:08.034]  Has Osama bin Laden ever been in this country, and with a passport, what name was on it?
[00:40:08.414 --> 00:40:10.475]  Yes, Tim Osmond, CIA asset.
[00:40:10.636 --> 00:40:12.597]  Have you ever seen a copy of the passport?
[00:40:13.457 --> 00:40:18.040]  It has been in the mainstream news that it was Tim Osmond, and that he was a CIA asset.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:19.501]  I don't have a copy of the passport, no.
[00:40:19.682 --> 00:40:22.003]  Another thing, what did he do around here?
[00:40:22.023 --> 00:40:23.044]  Did he have a house here?
[00:40:23.084 --> 00:40:23.544]  Did he work?
[00:40:23.824 --> 00:40:28.948]  He drove a Cadillac, had short hair, was involved in family business dealings, and recruited by the CIA.
[00:40:30.409 --> 00:40:30.969]  That's admitted.
[00:40:33.353 --> 00:40:34.794]  How did he turn bad all of a sudden?
[00:40:34.994 --> 00:40:35.874]  He didn't turn bad.
[00:40:35.914 --> 00:40:38.115]  He played the part of the Patsy for him.
[00:40:38.836 --> 00:40:41.677]  Did Bush cross him somewhere and he got mad?
[00:40:42.617 --> 00:40:42.877]  I don't know.
[00:40:42.917 --> 00:40:44.858]  How did Bin Laden order Norad to stand down?
[00:40:44.938 --> 00:40:48.700]  How did Bin Laden fly the Bin Ladens out of the country on the night of 9-11?
[00:40:50.097 --> 00:40:54.262]  How did Bin Laden call Mayor Willie Brown and tell him not to fly to New York that day?
[00:40:54.902 --> 00:40:59.407]  How did Bin Laden order the FBI not to stop Al Qaeda in this country?
[00:40:59.608 --> 00:41:04.113]  How did Bin Laden pay for the houses and cars through the FBI for the supposed hijackers?
[00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:07.496]  How did he get those supposed hijackers to trade at the Pensacola Naval Air Station?
[00:41:07.797 --> 00:41:09.359]  MSNBC, Pensacola News Journal.
[00:41:09.759 --> 00:41:10.520]  How did all that happen?
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.241]  Good question.
[00:41:11.621 --> 00:41:12.422]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[00:41:12.742 --> 00:41:14.823]  Good to hear from you, Ken, and yeah, it sounds like a good rally.
[00:41:15.323 --> 00:41:24.489]  I don't mind people calling in and plugging stuff, but it's getting to where we'll have, like, three or four callers in a row doing it, and then not even addressing any of the topics we've thrown out, and that's not good talk radio, folks.
[00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:27.211]  Let's talk to Gary in Tennessee.
[00:41:27.251 --> 00:41:27.971]  Gary, go ahead.
[00:41:29.172 --> 00:41:29.833]  Yeah, hello, Alex.
[00:41:30.093 --> 00:41:30.373]  Hello.
[00:41:31.474 --> 00:41:40.740]  I just wanted to tell you a little story real quick, kind of like assimilation to the New World Order and us.
[00:41:42.082 --> 00:42:10.682]  You know, they look at us as little people, you know, and anyway, what I was going to say was, I had this cat, another cat that had like three kittens, and one evening, I was, this guy next door had one of these great big old bull-grown bulldogs, like a bullmaster, and it was just walking upside the house, and the little kittens was following behind it.
[00:42:11.584 --> 00:42:16.489]  And that big ole' bulldog come runnin' over there like it was gonna have a meal, you know.
[00:42:16.509 --> 00:42:29.480]  And that mother cat, by defendin' its kittens, it, it, I mean, it flew into that big ole' bulldog like it wasn't nothin'.
[00:42:29.901 --> 00:42:36.487]  I mean, just, and that big bulldog just turned around and took its tail between its legs, took off a run.
[00:42:37.461 --> 00:42:40.130]  And that just goes to show you what we can do.
[00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:41.956]  Well that's the psychology.
[00:42:42.016 --> 00:42:43.841]  The New World Order takes our innate.
[00:42:45.003 --> 00:43:12.005]  programming to defend our families in our country and our children and says give your rights up that's how you defend america they take that and turn it around backwards whereas in truth that's why i fight so hard because i love my family and i don't want us to be slaves i love this country and we need to get back to those instincts that your little cat had against that bull master and and and and look when you know evil uh... you know comes against you if you stand up against it you know that's always the best policy
[00:43:12.245 --> 00:43:14.007]  Well, you're doing a great job, Alex.
[00:43:21.262 --> 00:43:22.803]  Uh, that's about it right now.
[00:43:22.823 --> 00:43:26.084]  You just keep up, I'm still making copies, and you just keep up the good work.
[00:43:26.104 --> 00:43:27.104]  I'll be praying for you.
[00:43:27.124 --> 00:43:29.785]  I want to thank all the lizards that have gotten the films and are making copies.
[00:43:29.846 --> 00:43:31.686]  It's having an ultra-massive effect.
[00:43:32.366 --> 00:43:33.487]  Uh, let's talk to Brad.
[00:43:33.527 --> 00:43:34.647]  Brad, where are you calling us from?
[00:43:34.907 --> 00:43:36.848]  Hi Alex, it's an honor to speak with you.
[00:43:36.868 --> 00:43:38.009]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:38.829]  From New York City.
[00:43:38.969 --> 00:43:39.309]  Welcome.
[00:43:39.969 --> 00:43:48.913]  Uh, yeah, I was trying to get the constitutional oath upon appointment under FOI, and I've been stonewalled, but I got a, I tape-recorded the conversation with the, uh,
[00:43:49.497 --> 00:44:00.645]  For those that don't know what you're talking about, most public officials now do not register their oath, do not swear their oath, which is criminal and they should be arrested according to state and federal laws.
[00:44:00.985 --> 00:44:02.526]  So you went and investigated this.
[00:44:02.566 --> 00:44:02.987]  Go ahead.
[00:44:03.147 --> 00:44:04.748]  Yeah, I tape recorded.
[00:44:04.788 --> 00:44:06.829]  I was hoping that I could play a few seconds.
[00:44:06.889 --> 00:44:09.331]  Tell me if I could stop, if I should stop or whatever.
[00:44:09.351 --> 00:44:10.752]  The tape recorded of what?
[00:44:11.192 --> 00:44:12.133]  Of the conversation.
[00:44:12.153 --> 00:44:14.395]  He was telling me I'm living in another world.
[00:44:14.495 --> 00:44:16.416]  It's not the law, you know, like
[00:44:17.284 --> 00:44:17.905]  Can I play this for you?
[00:44:17.925 --> 00:44:18.645]  Who was telling you?
[00:44:18.865 --> 00:44:19.966]  The city's attorney.
[00:44:20.927 --> 00:44:21.868]  For New York City?
[00:44:21.948 --> 00:44:22.168]  Yes.
[00:44:23.149 --> 00:44:25.831]  And he was saying that they don't have to have oaths?
[00:44:26.732 --> 00:44:29.714]  He said that it's not the real world, he can't find it.
[00:44:30.996 --> 00:44:31.976]  A whole bunch of stuff.
[00:44:32.456 --> 00:44:34.037]  If you listen, it's very interesting.
[00:44:34.077 --> 00:44:34.997]  Can I play, like, 30 seconds?
[00:44:35.097 --> 00:44:37.637]  Unfortunately, I don't know the laws of New York.
[00:44:37.697 --> 00:44:43.759]  I know Connecticut and several others have wiretapping rules, and I really... As long as you're party to a conversation, you're allowed to record.
[00:44:43.779 --> 00:44:52.921]  Yeah, but I'm not really in the business of airing clandestine recordings of people I don't even know who you are, who you're talking about, and I'm not trying to censor you, sir, but I can't do that.
[00:44:52.941 --> 00:44:53.981]  Alright, Alex.
[00:44:55.313 --> 00:44:55.954]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:56.054 --> 00:45:01.478]  I mean, it's an interesting point you bring up, and right here in Austin they've said they don't have to have oaths filed.
[00:45:02.158 --> 00:45:04.019]  Which is against the law, but they don't care.
[00:45:04.099 --> 00:45:12.726]  So it's a very legitimate point you brought up, and I'm sorry, I'm just not going to air clandestine recordings before I've investigated them here on the show.
[00:45:14.207 --> 00:45:18.210]  That's just major league liability.
[00:45:20.302 --> 00:45:28.984]  You have a very good track record here of not having any problems on this show because I mind my P's and Q's and we're effective and I'm not going to put this show or this network or our affiliate stations in jeopardy.
[00:45:29.464 --> 00:45:30.144]  That's just how it is?
[00:45:31.044 --> 00:45:33.884]  I'm not going to take any more calls for now because I'm going to get to some news.
[00:45:34.905 --> 00:45:38.385]  And maybe later we can have some callers that want to talk about some of these subjects.
[00:45:40.305 --> 00:45:42.046]  Read him on Fox Sunday.
[00:45:43.306 --> 00:45:48.907]  We got the transcript of it, just came out and said, hey, these people, you know, saying Bush is bad for making fun of weapons of mass destruction and
[00:45:49.858 --> 00:45:52.180]  You know, these families of the troops.
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:53.120]  I mean, just get over it!
[00:45:53.581 --> 00:45:54.541]  It's just a joke.
[00:45:54.561 --> 00:45:55.282]  Just get over it!
[00:45:55.882 --> 00:45:58.064]  You know, but if anybody else did that, it'd be horrible.
[00:45:58.104 --> 00:46:00.626]  But, you know, it's... What do you think about Bush Sr.
[00:46:00.646 --> 00:46:13.295]  saying, don't make fun of my son, and starting to cry in a speech, and then Barbara Bush on CNN saying, quote, you can criticize me, but don't criticize my children, and don't criticize my daughters-in-law, and don't criticize my husband, or you're dead.
[00:46:13.755 --> 00:46:14.276]  Close quote.
[00:46:15.296 --> 00:46:17.618]  What do you think about bombs killed five U.S.
[00:46:17.638 --> 00:46:17.918]  troops?
[00:46:17.998 --> 00:46:18.919]  Six died on Monday.
[00:46:19.983 --> 00:46:21.604]  They're dragging dead bodies around the streets.
[00:46:21.624 --> 00:46:22.404]  We don't know if they're U.S.
[00:46:22.424 --> 00:46:23.044]  troops or not.
[00:46:23.965 --> 00:46:26.565]  Some of them look like uniforms to me, what's left on the charred bodies.
[00:46:26.586 --> 00:46:29.327]  Again, one of the bloodiest days in weeks, the U.S.
[00:46:29.367 --> 00:46:29.747]  military.
[00:46:29.807 --> 00:46:34.008]  Five troops died when a bomb exploded under their military vehicles west of Baghdad on Wednesday.
[00:46:34.028 --> 00:46:38.110]  And more, a bunch of civilians have been killed.
[00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:40.251]  I mean, it's foggy right now.
[00:46:40.331 --> 00:46:41.711]  More people died in Fajala.
[00:46:42.291 --> 00:46:46.293]  So we don't really know exactly what's going on, but it's some grisly photos we got on the website.
[00:46:48.027 --> 00:46:55.713]  Firestrike's third largest refinery, Reuters, an explosion and fire rocked British petroleum oil refinery in Texas.
[00:46:56.594 --> 00:47:04.200]  The third largest in the United States on Tuesday, driving gasoline prices to an all-time high and unnerving currency markets worried about security threats.
[00:47:05.301 --> 00:47:10.626]  BP said there was no sign of any outside influence in the blast and fire, which came days after the U.S.
[00:47:10.646 --> 00:47:15.810]  Federal Bureau of Investigation warned Texas oil refineries of possible terror attacks ahead of elections in November.
[00:47:17.071 --> 00:47:21.292]  I've talked to a lot of FBI people and others and they say there's lots of terror attacks we're not told about.
[00:47:21.732 --> 00:47:27.494]  Yeah, lots of globalist events that they then bump red-level threat up and tell the police not to tell the public.
[00:47:27.834 --> 00:47:31.455]  That's kind of the excuse to heighten the internal police state expansion.
[00:47:33.175 --> 00:47:37.396]  So, we don't know what's going on at this time with that either.
[00:47:37.416 --> 00:47:38.736]  We'll watch it as it develops.
[00:47:40.937 --> 00:47:42.357]  This is out of Reuters as well.
[00:47:42.617 --> 00:47:45.298]  Fed denies Greenspan heart attack rumor.
[00:47:47.009 --> 00:47:47.109]  U.S.
[00:47:47.129 --> 00:47:53.891]  Federal Reserve on Wednesday said there was no truth to rumors that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has suffered a heart attack.
[00:47:54.451 --> 00:47:55.612]  Quote, there is no truth to the rumor.
[00:47:55.952 --> 00:47:59.253]  The chairman is fine, Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said.
[00:48:00.233 --> 00:48:02.634]  So that caused markets to go down as well.
[00:48:04.515 --> 00:48:06.295]  I'm going to get into 9-11 stand down order.
[00:48:09.554 --> 00:48:13.436]  And we'll also get into some of the police state developments, but I wanted to hit this first.
[00:48:13.496 --> 00:48:15.257]  A lot of you heard about Terri Schiavo.
[00:48:15.758 --> 00:48:17.219]  We've been talking about her for years.
[00:48:18.639 --> 00:48:25.763]  A lot of evidence of foul play when she had bones broken and suddenly was paralyzed from the shoulders down.
[00:48:25.884 --> 00:48:33.488]  She's awake, talks, smiles, laughs at her parents, follows a balloon, and they call that a coma.
[00:48:33.528 --> 00:48:34.909]  Now they have to admit it's not a coma.
[00:48:35.249 --> 00:48:38.611]  They tried to remove her feeding tubes many times.
[00:48:39.989 --> 00:48:42.350]  They have removed him several, what, three or four times.
[00:48:42.970 --> 00:49:05.076]  I will now punch your wounds found on Terry's arms attempted murder question mark life news reports Clearwater Florida just one day after a local judge said Terry Shibo's estranged husband wasn't violating court order by denying Terry's parents information about her medical condition Terry has been taken to a local hospital with apparent puncture wounds on her arms
[00:49:05.928 --> 00:49:14.492]  Hospice workers at Park Place Assisted Living Facility in Clearwater, Florida, where Terry is living, noticed the wounds apparently caused by a hypodermic needle.
[00:49:15.513 --> 00:49:27.299]  George Fellows, the lead attorney for Michael Schiavo, who's remarried with two children, said that Terry was taken to Morton Plant Hospital on Monday night for toxicology tests and other mud work.
[00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:31.361]  Michael Schiavo works the hospital as a staff nurse.
[00:49:32.821 --> 00:49:33.842]  Oh, yeah!
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:43.743]  Phelous, an assistant suicide advocate, said a hospital staff discovered the marks Monday after Terry's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, had spent 45 minutes with their daughter.
[00:49:43.843 --> 00:49:45.464]  Oh, isn't that sick what they're trying to say?
[00:49:46.344 --> 00:49:46.504]  Ms.
[00:49:46.544 --> 00:49:58.509]  Schiavo was found in a disheveled state with her feeding tube wrapped around her back and an allergy band pulled up very tight on her arm like a tourniquet, Phelous said in a press release.
[00:49:59.475 --> 00:50:04.236]  On one arm were four fresh puncture wounds with another fresh puncture wound on her other arm.
[00:50:04.656 --> 00:50:09.718]  Also found were fresh scratch wounds over the puncture wounds as if attempts were made to conceal the puncture wounds.
[00:50:09.758 --> 00:50:18.120]  It appears that someone was either trying to inject Terri Schiavo with something or that they did indeed withdraw fluids from her fellow sick.
[00:50:19.861 --> 00:50:27.883]  Bob Schindler, Terri's father, said Tampa's WTSP-TV that he did not inject anything into Terri and that his daughter was fine when Schindler's finished their visit with her.
[00:50:29.355 --> 00:50:30.035]  Well, let me see.
[00:50:30.115 --> 00:50:46.958]  It's, uh, Mr. Shivo, who told the court he wanted to take care of her and get custody, and then won't let anybody brush her teeth or take care of her, and tries to block the family from brushing her teeth or giving her food, and has blocked nurses and doctors from feeding her, because she can eat!
[00:50:50.039 --> 00:50:55.259]  And, uh, he's the nurse in there, but magically they found this, and they think the family did it.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:58.140]  Isn't that a nice, nice tactic?
[00:50:58.823 --> 00:51:00.784]  Be right back.
[00:51:02.966 --> 00:51:08.890]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:51:09.131 --> 00:51:11.392]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:51:47.788 --> 00:51:50.871]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:51:51.031 --> 00:51:56.898]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:52:01.357 --> 00:52:08.743]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:52:09.024 --> 00:52:13.748]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:52:13.968 --> 00:52:19.633]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:52:19.873 --> 00:52:24.374]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:52:24.614 --> 00:52:31.757]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:52:31.797 --> 00:52:36.318]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:52:36.478 --> 00:52:38.979]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:52:39.219 --> 00:52:45.921]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:52:46.161 --> 00:52:51.427]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:52:51.447 --> 00:52:51.867]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:53:00.163 --> 00:53:08.427]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:53:08.668 --> 00:53:13.030]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:53:13.330 --> 00:53:22.235]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:53:22.455 --> 00:53:26.077]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:53:26.357 --> 00:53:31.385]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:53:31.685 --> 00:53:38.435]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:53:38.915 --> 00:53:39.456]  What about you?
[00:53:40.186 --> 00:53:45.547]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:53:45.607 --> 00:53:46.627]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:53:46.767 --> 00:53:48.608]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:54:13.474 --> 00:54:20.500]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight central, we do this show, this broadcast.
[00:54:22.121 --> 00:54:27.025]  I tell you, I want to get to the stand down order.
[00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:31.308]  Now we know that on 9-11 they were ordering order to stand down.
[00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:37.053]  We know that that happened, but also they changed the direct policy.
[00:54:38.534 --> 00:54:40.736]  They changed the policy itself
[00:54:41.465 --> 00:54:53.410]  A few months before 9-11 where generals couldn't act independently to shoot down jets as they could in the past if they were going to fly into buildings or crash or go into populated areas.
[00:54:54.610 --> 00:55:02.914]  As they were prepared to do with Payne Stewart, they guided the aircraft, that is they followed it until it crashed in some cornfields.
[00:55:04.258 --> 00:55:09.880]  But not on 9-11, and now it's come out, found the 9-11 stand down order.
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:15.002]  Jim Hoffman has discovered a document which I believe may be very important to the 9-11 skeptic movement.
[00:55:15.482 --> 00:55:27.107]  This document supersedes earlier DOD procedures for dealing with hijacked aircraft, and it requires that Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld is personally responsible for issuing the intercept orders.
[00:55:27.447 --> 00:55:30.348]  Commanders in the field are stripped of all authority to act.
[00:55:30.568 --> 00:55:32.049]  This amazing order came from
[00:55:33.081 --> 00:55:33.381]  S.A.
[00:55:33.522 --> 00:55:35.163]  Fry, Vice Admiral, U.S.
[00:55:35.223 --> 00:55:40.227]  Navy, and Director of Joint Staff, so it appears to me that responsibility for the U.S.
[00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:53.139]  Armed Forces quote, failure to respond, rests directly with Fry for issuing this instruction, as well as Donald Rumsfeld for failing to execute his responsibility to issue orders in a timely fashion.
[00:55:54.469 --> 00:56:21.956]  And on June 1st, 2001, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Instruction CJCSI 3610.01A, dated again June 1st, 2001, was issued for the purposes of providing guidance to the Deputy Director for Operations, DDO, National Military Command Center, and operational commanders in the event of an aircraft piracy hijacking, or request for destruction of derelict airborne objects, close quote.
[00:56:22.436 --> 00:56:30.200]  This new instruction supersedes, this is still from the document, CJCS13610.01 of 31st July 1997.
[00:56:30.641 --> 00:56:41.907]  We'll cover this more later with Aaron Russo and we'll get into just all the news with our fiery guest that is coming up that you do not, believe me, want to miss.
[00:56:41.947 --> 00:56:46.970]  You've only hit the tip of the iceberg here on the show.
[00:56:48.129 --> 00:56:50.350]  So believe me again, my friends, you're going to want to stay with us.
[00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:52.871]  By the way, in Florida they're recruiting salons.
[00:56:54.171 --> 00:56:55.672]  The tattletales for abuse.
[00:56:58.133 --> 00:57:00.794]  Everything turning into Stasi America.
[00:57:00.814 --> 00:57:02.795]  It's just getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:57:02.815 --> 00:57:06.356]  There have been some new developments with the Supreme Court ruling that there's no Fifth Amendment.
[00:57:07.237 --> 00:57:11.098]  And the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:57:11.719 --> 00:57:14.700]  And so some new developments there as well that we will cover.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:17.581]  Clear Channel, big neocon liberal radio.
[00:57:18.462 --> 00:57:21.223]  It's going to give Jesse Jackson a radio show nationwide.
[00:57:21.263 --> 00:57:22.243]  That's pretty disgusting.
[00:57:23.204 --> 00:57:24.084]  So there you go.
[00:57:24.984 --> 00:57:31.406]  Two different flavors of socialism and big government fraud in the personage of Lord Jackson.
[00:57:32.787 --> 00:57:37.728]  The last minute here of this hour, I do want to encourage every single one of you to do what many others have done.
[00:57:37.748 --> 00:57:46.171]  To get three or more, or one, but you get big discounts when you get three or more, of my full-length feature, professionally produced, shocking, riveting,
[00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:52.773]  Frankly, quite scary videos that are waking people up in mass, on mass.

[00:58:07.241 --> 00:58:13.705]  The best material exposing the New World Order out there today is at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.

[00:58:16.336 --> 00:58:17.517]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:17.557 --> 00:58:23.281]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:58:40.908 --> 00:58:46.662]  Nobody's gonna see these videos and wake up if you don't decide to get up and take action and get off the bench and get in the game.
[00:58:47.525 --> 00:58:49.951]  Get off the bench, join me in the game, we'll be right back.
[00:58:53.004 --> 00:58:57.508]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:58:57.868 --> 00:59:01.952]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:59:02.252 --> 00:59:02.793]  We listened.
[00:59:03.113 --> 00:59:08.077]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:59:08.357 --> 00:59:08.858]  We listened.
[00:59:09.238 --> 00:59:12.281]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:59:12.701 --> 00:59:13.242]  We listened.
[00:59:13.702 --> 00:59:17.125]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[00:59:17.125 --> 00:59:17.405]  I don't know.
[00:59:43.596 --> 00:59:44.617]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:44.837 --> 00:59:46.919]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:46.979 --> 00:59:47.599]  Big Brother.
[00:59:47.619 --> 00:59:48.900]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:49.001 --> 00:59:54.345]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:55.706]  You want answers?
[00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:57.407]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.195 --> 01:00:09.980]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.486]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:19.031]  All right, my friends.
[01:00:19.252 --> 01:00:22.536]  Outward number two of this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:26.831]  From Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California.
[01:00:27.251 --> 01:00:29.751]  Blasting out on the growing list of AM and FM affiliates.
[01:00:30.151 --> 01:00:34.052]  Shovelcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 9475 at night, 3210.
[01:00:35.172 --> 01:00:38.693]  And of course, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:00:38.713 --> 01:00:41.913]  We're going to take your calls, cover a lot of news in this hour.
[01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:47.154]  Get the take of Aaron Russo, who's running for President as a Libertarian.
[01:00:47.175 --> 01:00:47.975]  Get his take on it.
[01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:49.435]  We've aired here locally on cable.
[01:00:50.237 --> 01:00:53.999]  Some of his Mad as Hell series, TV show he did, it's excellent.
[01:00:54.519 --> 01:00:58.942]  He's exposed the police state, asset formature seizure, NAFTA gap, you name it.
[01:00:58.982 --> 01:01:02.804]  He's produced a lot of big blockbuster Hollywood films.
[01:01:03.602 --> 01:01:08.843]  And he knows all about the New World Order, and we're honored to have him on.
[01:01:08.883 --> 01:01:11.264]  And also, The Network, he's been on a bunch of the shows.
[01:01:11.844 --> 01:01:18.625]  The Network sends out some of his presidential material for free if you want to call and get any of that.
[01:01:19.285 --> 01:01:21.426]  But Mr. Russo, it's good to have you on the show.
[01:01:21.706 --> 01:01:22.446]  Hey, thank you.
[01:01:22.466 --> 01:01:23.186]  Glad to be here, bud.
[01:01:23.846 --> 01:01:30.648]  For those that don't know who you are, tell us a little bit about yourself, and then we'll go to break and come back and just jump into all the news and get your take on it.
[01:01:30.948 --> 01:01:31.208]  Sure.
[01:01:32.148 --> 01:01:32.768]  All right, let's see.
[01:01:33.108 --> 01:01:33.949]  I don't know where to start.
[01:01:33.989 --> 01:01:34.389]  Let's see.
[01:01:35.189 --> 01:01:42.692]  Nineteen years old, I was in the ladies lingerie business and I designed the first ladies bikini panties for all everybody that was interested in that.
[01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:53.677]  And then when I was 24, I opened a nightclub in Chicago and put on big name rock and roll shows with Led Zeppelin, The Who, Grateful Dead, on and on.
[01:01:53.697 --> 01:01:55.458]  You know, I was one of the big rock promoters in the 60s.
[01:01:56.664 --> 01:02:10.694]  At Chicago and Detroit, and then I ran to Bette Midler, and I started managing Bette Midler, and I produced the movie called The Rose, and the movie Trading Places with Eddie Murphy and Danny Aykroyd, and I received six Academy Award nominations.
[01:02:11.315 --> 01:02:18.019]  I've won an Emmy for a TV show I did with Dustin Hoffman, and a Golden Globe nomination.
[01:02:18.039 --> 01:02:20.081]  By the way, I love Trading Places.
[01:02:20.421 --> 01:02:21.282]  Thank you very much.
[01:02:21.362 --> 01:02:25.645]  It was funny, I always thought that was the most important thing I had done, but
[01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:30.192]  Most people yell and scream and cheer when I tell them I brought Led Zeppelin to America.
[01:02:30.212 --> 01:02:34.214]  I guess it depends which side you're on.
[01:02:34.234 --> 01:02:35.935]  The music side or the movie side.
[01:02:36.215 --> 01:02:40.377]  But I've done television, done movies, done music, and I've done so many different things.
[01:02:40.417 --> 01:02:44.599]  I won a Tony on Broadway for a show I did with Lionel Hampton and Bette Midler.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:52.142]  I made the video called Mad as Hell, which millions of people across America have seen, promoting freedom in the country.
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:02:57.724]  I ran for Governor of Nevada in 1998 and I got nearly 30% in a four-way race.
[01:03:00.259 --> 01:03:01.640]  I did very, very well there.
[01:03:02.201 --> 01:03:06.384]  Yeah, you're very charismatic, and a lot of people try to know their facts, know their issues.
[01:03:06.724 --> 01:03:07.985]  You know what you're talking about.
[01:03:08.346 --> 01:03:10.888]  I think you'd make a great president, Aaron.
[01:03:11.308 --> 01:03:12.089]  Thanks so much.
[01:03:12.149 --> 01:03:12.949]  It's very kind of you.
[01:03:12.969 --> 01:03:13.810]  I appreciate that.
[01:03:14.110 --> 01:03:17.193]  Well, I think in the process, you'll at least educate a lot of people in this.
[01:03:18.114 --> 01:03:20.596]  You're not a member of Skull and Bones, and that's a good thing for you, too.
[01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:21.456]  Well, that's one of the things.
[01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:24.559]  People say to me, Aaron, do you have any skulls in your closet?
[01:03:24.599 --> 01:03:27.161]  I say, there are no skulls and bones in my closet.
[01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:37.975]  You know, the thing about me is also, I've made many movies, and every movie I've ever made has been brought in on time, on budget.
[01:03:38.455 --> 01:03:51.482]  You know, I'm very, very fiscally conservative, and I have very, very strong beliefs about this economy, and things that need to be done, and the Federal Reserve, and how they're destroying this country, and that they must be abolished.
[01:03:51.502 --> 01:03:54.684]  For us to ever get America healthy again, we must abolish the Federal Reserve.
[01:03:55.376 --> 01:03:56.077]  You know what I mean?
[01:04:10.058 --> 01:04:14.479]  Uh, in creating movies and doing business are very helpful towards getting this presidency.
[01:04:14.579 --> 01:04:18.840]  You've certainly demonstrated that, and you've been out there fighting tyranny for a long time.
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:29.523]  When we get back, I want to find out when you discovered the Federal Reserve, the New World Order system, what that was like for this highly successful promoter, a film producer, what that process was like.
[01:04:30.323 --> 01:04:34.007]  Throw out different news stories that you can get your response to them.
[01:04:34.308 --> 01:04:35.889]  We should also tell folks your website.
[01:04:35.909 --> 01:04:38.172]  It's Russo4President.com.
[01:04:38.232 --> 01:04:40.314]  Russo spelled R-U-S-S-O.
[01:04:40.955 --> 01:04:43.598]  Russo4President.com.
[01:04:43.918 --> 01:04:47.842]  Got a big fat link to it on Infowars.com.
[01:04:48.083 --> 01:04:50.405]  We'll be back with Aaron Russo, who's running for president.
[01:04:50.425 --> 01:04:50.946]  Stay with us!
[01:04:53.644 --> 01:04:57.974]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:58.175 --> 01:05:02.625]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:03.908]  There is a chance...
[01:05:04.974 --> 01:05:05.895]  What's this disaster?
[01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.137]  The New World Order.
[01:05:07.177 --> 01:05:08.558]  The New World Order.
[01:05:09.259 --> 01:05:09.960]  Can emerge.
[01:05:10.301 --> 01:05:14.526]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:05:14.586 --> 01:05:21.514]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:23.677]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.877 --> 01:05:34.344]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.644 --> 01:05:40.028]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.528 --> 01:05:43.910]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:05:43.930 --> 01:05:44.290]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:05:44.310 --> 01:05:45.571]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:05:53.076 --> 01:05:56.317]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:05:56.397 --> 01:06:00.579]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:06:00.819 --> 01:06:03.600]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.201]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:06:06.401 --> 01:06:15.045]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:16.585]  The Berkeley light is different.
[01:06:16.785 --> 01:06:20.947]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:06:21.267 --> 01:06:21.787]  We're good to go!
[01:06:40.213 --> 01:06:43.038]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:06:43.058 --> 01:06:43.939]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:53.680]  Are you losing your hair?
[01:06:54.021 --> 01:06:55.421]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:56.882]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[01:06:57.442 --> 01:06:59.063]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[01:06:59.303 --> 01:07:03.785]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people, just like you, regrow their hair.
[01:07:04.085 --> 01:07:05.605]  I am 39 years old.
[01:07:05.886 --> 01:07:08.207]  I've been slowly balding over the last 10 years.
[01:07:08.327 --> 01:07:11.768]  Thanks to Avocor, my hair is coming back and I couldn't be more excited.
[01:07:11.888 --> 01:07:13.489]  The best product that I've tried.
[01:07:13.689 --> 01:07:15.690]  Avocor is the product of the 21st century.
[01:07:17.714 --> 01:07:22.459]  New Avocor makes your hair visibly thicker and fuller with the very first application.
[01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:23.370]  Call 800-397-7234.
[01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.510]  800-397-7234.
[01:07:23.570 --> 01:07:26.292]  Avocor is proven to stop hair loss and regrow hair.
[01:07:26.332 --> 01:07:30.115]  We're so sure Avocor will work for you, there's up to a full one-year guarantee.
[01:07:30.155 --> 01:07:30.816]  Call today.
[01:07:30.836 --> 01:07:30.996]  800-397-7234.
[01:07:31.016 --> 01:07:31.416]  That's 800-397-7234.
[01:07:31.456 --> 01:07:32.837]  Regrow your hair with Avocor.
[01:07:32.897 --> 01:07:33.057]  Call 800-397-7234.
[01:07:33.077 --> 01:07:33.678]  Order Avocor today.
[01:07:54.941 --> 01:08:00.949]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:04.613]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:08.078]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.801]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:08:10.961 --> 01:08:13.725]  Defending this country against tyranny.
[01:08:15.296 --> 01:08:18.238]  Resisting the despotism that is upon us.
[01:08:18.638 --> 01:08:22.281]  I'm honored to have him on the show, and I heard he was running for president about a month ago.
[01:08:22.301 --> 01:08:22.961]  I wanted to get him on.
[01:08:22.981 --> 01:08:23.842]  We finally got him on.
[01:08:23.862 --> 01:08:24.822]  He's Aaron Russo.
[01:08:25.683 --> 01:08:29.986]  And again, this guy ran for governor in Nevada as a third-party candidate.
[01:08:30.026 --> 01:08:31.847]  Got 30% of the vote.
[01:08:31.867 --> 01:08:32.828]  That's a big deal.
[01:08:32.888 --> 01:08:33.648]  He's passionate.
[01:08:33.948 --> 01:08:34.769]  He's intelligent.
[01:08:34.789 --> 01:08:37.751]  He's an award-winning, again, producer of major films.
[01:08:38.411 --> 01:08:40.713]  And he's been out there fighting the New World Order for a long time.
[01:08:41.616 --> 01:08:44.939]  Aaron Russo, when did you wake up to the New World Order?
[01:08:45.299 --> 01:08:52.526]  What was the process like for a big promoter who was bringing Led Zeppelin to America and making big films and doing all this?
[01:08:52.726 --> 01:08:53.927]  What was the process like?
[01:08:53.987 --> 01:08:57.450]  When did you wake up to what was going on?
[01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:01.854]  Well, it's an interesting question because it's sort of subtle.
[01:09:01.914 --> 01:09:03.655]  It just grows on you a little bit at a time.
[01:09:04.116 --> 01:09:06.518]  It's not like one day you just wake up and recognize it.
[01:09:06.558 --> 01:09:07.579]  At least for me it wasn't.
[01:09:07.947 --> 01:09:08.447]  Exactly.
[01:09:08.527 --> 01:09:10.988]  You know, for me, it was a gradual thing.
[01:09:11.108 --> 01:09:15.329]  I just said, you know, the entire situation, these guys are really terrible.
[01:09:15.729 --> 01:09:17.430]  How can they behave the way they behave?
[01:09:17.470 --> 01:09:28.213]  And then you start reading books and you start seeing the police, you know, treating people poorly and, you know, treating people as if they were dogs and sheep.
[01:09:28.653 --> 01:09:29.873]  So how could this be this way?
[01:09:30.093 --> 01:09:31.434]  I don't remember it was this way when I grew up.
[01:09:31.954 --> 01:09:35.875]  And you start seeing more and more, and more and more grows on you and you begin to realize
[01:09:36.539 --> 01:09:43.501]  And then I left the country and said, you know, I was so fed up with America that I said, you know, there's only three things you can do.
[01:09:43.681 --> 01:09:45.461]  And I'll also add that you're also a veteran.
[01:09:46.062 --> 01:09:46.382]  Oh yeah.
[01:09:46.842 --> 01:09:48.722]  But there's really only three things you can do.
[01:09:48.742 --> 01:09:58.625]  You can either leave the country, you can sort of work away and be very quiet and just mind your own business and not be too obvious, as some people do it, or you can fight.
[01:09:59.622 --> 01:10:01.523]  And so the first thing I did, I'm getting out of here.
[01:10:01.983 --> 01:10:02.303]  You know?
[01:10:02.724 --> 01:10:06.285]  You chose the path, though, of not being a coward.
[01:10:06.365 --> 01:10:07.246]  Now you're fighting it.
[01:10:07.486 --> 01:10:07.906]  Oh, now?
[01:10:07.986 --> 01:10:11.068]  Yeah, I'm just trying to tell you how it's, you know, the evolution of everything.
[01:10:11.128 --> 01:10:14.530]  And the path of the coward is just doing nothing and minding your own business.
[01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:15.970]  Well, I agree with that.
[01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.071]  It's not necessarily a coward.
[01:10:17.091 --> 01:10:19.312]  You know, some people... No, I'm not saying you're a coward.
[01:10:19.332 --> 01:10:25.435]  What I'm saying is that I've been cowardly before in the past fighting this, but I just decided to be as bold as possible.
[01:10:25.675 --> 01:10:26.476]  I think you have to be.
[01:10:26.516 --> 01:10:31.160]  Ultimately, that's where I came out as well, because I first left the country and I moved to Tahiti with my family.
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.361]  Oh boy, that sounds good.
[01:10:32.601 --> 01:10:33.742]  And it was fabulous, you know.
[01:10:34.462 --> 01:10:38.946]  But I began to realize, particularly Ross Perot was very important to me.
[01:10:39.326 --> 01:10:50.636]  Even though Ross Perot doesn't have a philosophy that I believe in, seeing that when he ran, all the millions of people that were dissatisfied with America, except for them, I thought I was alone.
[01:10:51.036 --> 01:10:53.478]  I didn't realize there were millions of others that felt like I did.
[01:10:53.797 --> 01:10:55.839]  I thought it was this lonely voice all by myself.
[01:10:56.511 --> 01:11:03.596]  So when Ross Perot ran, and I saw the dissatisfaction in the country, it gave me the courage and the energy to say, you know, I'm going to stand up now.
[01:11:03.956 --> 01:11:18.206]  Now that's a big part of it, is they make us feel alone, all compartmentalized, but Aaron, I've done over 1,500 radio interviews the last three years, and I'm telling you, we'll take 20, 30 calls, and they all agree, whereas five years ago, half of them disagreed.
[01:11:18.526 --> 01:11:20.468]  I've seen a massive awakening take place.
[01:11:20.568 --> 01:11:21.769]  There's no question about it.
[01:11:21.969 --> 01:11:24.831]  That's one of the reasons why I run for President, and what happened was,
[01:11:25.270 --> 01:11:28.371]  When I first began to wake up, I started the Constitution Party.
[01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:31.432]  You know, which is something that still in existence today.
[01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:33.112]  Howard Phillips is now running.
[01:11:33.213 --> 01:11:34.653]  And it's educated millions of people.
[01:11:34.833 --> 01:11:35.473]  Yes, it has.
[01:11:35.853 --> 01:11:40.995]  And so I started that party, and then I made Mad as Hell, and I put that out there.
[01:11:41.735 --> 01:11:53.759]  And now, you know, what I've tried to do is I ran for governor, and I woke up a lot of people in Nevada, and now I'm taking all my experience, all my years of being a producer, of knowing how to market,
[01:11:54.167 --> 01:11:58.308]  Of knowing how to reach out to the public and take my philosophy of freedom.
[01:11:58.328 --> 01:12:02.849]  You know, the motto of my campaign is, all your freedoms, all the time.
[01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.929]  Oh, that's wonderful.
[01:12:04.109 --> 01:12:05.570]  That's what we have to stand for.
[01:12:05.710 --> 01:12:07.690]  All your freedoms, all the time.
[01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:14.252]  Well, you're a bold bulldog in this fight, and I want to throw a few articles out at you.
[01:12:14.272 --> 01:12:16.812]  Court opens door to searches without warrants.
[01:12:17.273 --> 01:12:20.133]  Dissenting judges call ruling the road to hell.
[01:12:20.153 --> 01:12:23.034]  Fifth Circuit rules they don't need warrants to come in your house.
[01:12:23.474 --> 01:12:26.296]  And I made the point that they can claim that black people aren't human beings.
[01:12:26.656 --> 01:12:27.997]  Those rulings are null and void.
[01:12:28.398 --> 01:12:36.543]  Then in Nevada, your state, a headline in the Las Vegas Review Journal, the road to the police state, most Americans show their papers, please.
[01:12:37.224 --> 01:12:41.227]  The Supreme Court said there's no Fifth Amendment in your own backyard or on the sidewalk.
[01:12:41.447 --> 01:12:43.968]  You've got to give them an ID card and answer all their questions.
[01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:45.630]  I thought we had a Fifth Amendment, Aaron.
[01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.091]  Did they come out with that today?
[01:12:47.111 --> 01:12:48.492]  They came out with that Monday.
[01:12:49.012 --> 01:12:49.472]  No kidding.
[01:12:49.532 --> 01:12:50.333]  I've been on the ride.
[01:12:50.553 --> 01:12:51.714]  Somehow I must have missed that.
[01:12:52.384 --> 01:12:54.385]  Oh my God, I didn't know they came out with that ruling.
[01:12:55.186 --> 01:12:55.946]  What do you think about it?
[01:12:56.046 --> 01:12:57.087]  Again, it's the path.
[01:12:57.347 --> 01:12:58.908]  We're going down this path.
[01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:02.470]  There's no more personal freedom in this country.
[01:13:03.031 --> 01:13:06.012]  And again, I keep going back, that's why I'm running for presidency.
[01:13:06.072 --> 01:13:09.995]  I mean, it's just one abuse after the other on the people of America.
[01:13:10.355 --> 01:13:15.198]  Sometimes when I speak, I tell people America's becoming a police state, and it is a police state.
[01:13:15.538 --> 01:13:17.699]  They say, what do you mean, America's the freest country in the world?
[01:13:17.719 --> 01:13:19.520]  I say, no, let me give you an example.
[01:13:20.061 --> 01:13:21.902]  Imagine you're driving your car down the highway.
[01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:23.499]  You're minding your own business.
[01:13:23.880 --> 01:13:25.621]  You're obeying all the traffic laws, even.
[01:13:26.322 --> 01:13:30.666]  And you're driving along, you look in your rearview mirror, and you see a police car coming up behind you.
[01:13:31.146 --> 01:13:32.167]  How does that make you feel?
[01:13:32.588 --> 01:13:34.570]  Safe and secure, or uncomfortable?
[01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:37.212]  And it's 100% uncomfortable!
[01:13:37.933 --> 01:13:43.638]  Where I was 30 years ago... Because that servant is there, that man is your servant, he works for you.
[01:13:43.958 --> 01:13:45.480]  Why can he make you uncomfortable?
[01:13:46.457 --> 01:13:47.518]  It should not be that way.
[01:13:47.598 --> 01:13:49.359]  Why are they wearing black ski masks?
[01:13:49.419 --> 01:13:51.040]  Why are they driving armored vehicles?
[01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.081]  Exactly.
[01:13:52.121 --> 01:13:53.842]  Taking our blood at checkpoints now.
[01:13:53.882 --> 01:13:55.123]  Have you heard about that?
[01:13:55.303 --> 01:13:55.963]  Of course I have.
[01:13:56.143 --> 01:13:57.164]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:13:57.404 --> 01:13:59.185]  It's beyond insanity.
[01:13:59.305 --> 01:14:01.187]  It's total tyranny.
[01:14:01.227 --> 01:14:04.109]  I mean, that's why the people of America have to wake up.
[01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:05.369]  That's why I'm running for president.
[01:14:05.389 --> 01:14:10.813]  I'm spending a personal fortune doing this because I believe so much in the founding fathers and what we have here.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:16.205]  You know, I'm just trying to look at myself in the mirror every day and say, Aaron, at least you're trying.
[01:14:16.505 --> 01:14:19.648]  Well, you're a bulldog, and God bless you for what you're doing.
[01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:22.591]  It's just... But we know what's happening out there.
[01:14:23.031 --> 01:14:30.719]  People are actually waking up, because what's interesting this year is that with Kerry and Bush, you have a situation where they're virtually identical.
[01:14:30.759 --> 01:14:31.360]  They're cousins!
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:33.001]  They're virtually identical.
[01:14:33.321 --> 01:14:35.804]  And people in America, you know, they're trying to convince Americans
[01:14:36.314 --> 01:14:37.435]  That how different they are.
[01:14:37.755 --> 01:14:38.535]  But it's laughable.
[01:14:38.796 --> 01:14:41.437]  So when people say, Aaron, what do you mean they're identical?
[01:14:41.677 --> 01:14:42.898]  I start naming off a list.
[01:14:43.158 --> 01:14:43.859]  Let's start looking.
[01:14:44.059 --> 01:14:45.160]  They both voted for the war.
[01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:47.581]  They both want to send more troops to Iraq.
[01:14:47.881 --> 01:14:49.482]  They both support the Patriot Act.
[01:14:49.862 --> 01:14:51.023]  They both overspend.
[01:14:51.844 --> 01:14:55.126]  They both support the military draft that's coming.
[01:14:55.386 --> 01:14:57.027]  They both support the Federal Reserve.
[01:14:57.578 --> 01:15:01.941]  They're both supporting the FCC and the ban on free speech.
[01:15:02.881 --> 01:15:07.264]  George Bush and Kerry both stand for free speech zones in America, right?
[01:15:07.824 --> 01:15:09.726]  I mean, they both want the skull and bones.
[01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:11.267]  They both support welfare.
[01:15:13.468 --> 01:15:15.009]  But they both support foreign aid.
[01:15:15.069 --> 01:15:19.532]  They both support the upcoming assault weapons ban that Bush says he'll sign.
[01:15:19.612 --> 01:15:21.173]  Exactly, the gun control issues.
[01:15:21.233 --> 01:15:22.554]  I mean, it's everything.
[01:15:23.114 --> 01:15:24.675]  But people are waking up to it and saying,
[01:15:25.089 --> 01:15:26.489]  You know, we don't know who to vote for.
[01:15:26.549 --> 01:15:28.390]  I'm saying, here, I'm going to give you a choice.
[01:15:28.690 --> 01:15:29.990]  That's why I'm running for president.
[01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:32.851]  I'm going to use all my marketing skills, everything I know.
[01:15:32.871 --> 01:15:37.272]  Well, Aaron, I know they let you in the debate because you're a revenue speaker and know your stuff.
[01:15:37.292 --> 01:15:38.472]  You're, as I said, a bulldog.
[01:15:38.492 --> 01:15:39.472]  That's what you remind me of.
[01:15:39.572 --> 01:15:40.553]  Are you seeing Man of Hell?
[01:15:40.573 --> 01:15:42.433]  Yeah, we've aired it here in Austin.
[01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:43.893]  Oh, fab!
[01:15:43.933 --> 01:15:44.513]  I didn't know that.
[01:15:44.593 --> 01:15:45.014]  Thank you.
[01:15:45.234 --> 01:15:45.694]  Oh, you bet.
[01:15:45.714 --> 01:15:46.434]  But if you were a...
[01:15:48.081 --> 01:15:49.102]  They let you in the debate.
[01:15:49.242 --> 01:15:50.963]  They put you on a bunch of TV shows.
[01:15:51.263 --> 01:15:54.526]  I know you get the votes, but they learn not to do that.
[01:15:54.606 --> 01:15:59.089]  How are you going to force the mainstream media to give you more than a few paltry interviews?
[01:15:59.549 --> 01:16:00.610]  Well, let's see.
[01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:02.692]  Last week I was on Fox News.
[01:16:03.512 --> 01:16:04.533]  I was on CNN.
[01:16:05.113 --> 01:16:11.058]  The fact that I come from Hollywood and I have all that background gives them a spin that they like to talk about.
[01:16:11.078 --> 01:16:13.920]  I just made two TV commercials.
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:15.881]  When you see them, you're going to just
[01:16:16.403 --> 01:16:17.923]  Be awed by the TV commercials.
[01:16:17.943 --> 01:16:19.424]  They're so very, very powerful.
[01:16:20.444 --> 01:16:21.964]  I was on Neil Bortz yesterday.
[01:16:21.984 --> 01:16:24.545]  I'm going to be on Howard Stern Friday.
[01:16:24.565 --> 01:16:27.245]  I'm talking to Dennis.
[01:16:27.505 --> 01:16:30.146]  I'm talking to all the big TV shows now that are putting me on.
[01:16:30.706 --> 01:16:33.707]  And they do put me on because I come out of that community.
[01:16:33.987 --> 01:16:35.207]  And I know all those people.
[01:16:35.267 --> 01:16:36.287]  I come from that world.
[01:16:36.827 --> 01:16:38.628]  And so they know me on a different level.
[01:16:38.648 --> 01:16:41.808]  So it's hard for them to pigeonhole you or say you're a quack?
[01:16:42.008 --> 01:16:45.489]  That's the beauty of what I'm doing is I come out of the establishment
[01:16:45.802 --> 01:16:51.364]  And then I stand up for all these issues that I believe in, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, everything we've been discussing.
[01:16:51.744 --> 01:16:56.566]  And because I come from the establishment, I'm dangerous to them.
[01:16:57.946 --> 01:17:01.628]  You see... What type of feedback have you gotten from the neocons and the liberals?
[01:17:01.888 --> 01:17:07.170]  Well, I'll tell you, when I ran for governor of Nevada, even Jack Nicholson, who's a liberal, supported me.
[01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:08.750]  He made radio commercials for me.
[01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:09.991]  Okay?
[01:17:10.231 --> 01:17:13.372]  So if I can start getting the Hollywood community behind my campaign,
[01:17:14.252 --> 01:17:15.732]  It's going to get tons and tons of press.
[01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:17.473]  And there's no third party in the race.
[01:17:17.513 --> 01:17:18.893]  Ralph Nader's going to fade away.
[01:17:18.913 --> 01:17:20.373]  He's got nothing to do.
[01:17:20.714 --> 01:17:23.674]  So I'm going to be there to fulfill that.
[01:17:24.114 --> 01:17:34.857]  And there are millions and millions of people across America who if they had someone to vote for who believed in the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and getting rid of this gun control nonsense, they would come out and vote.
[01:17:35.589 --> 01:17:36.790]  Absolutely.
[01:17:37.050 --> 01:17:38.771]  And we have to tap into that, Alex.
[01:17:39.111 --> 01:17:39.752]  That's the point.
[01:17:39.972 --> 01:17:49.278]  We have to tap into the dissatisfaction of America and say to the American people, here's a guy who believes like you believe, and he's standing up and fighting for it.
[01:17:49.638 --> 01:17:55.722]  Now, I'm pretty sure you're the most prominent candidate out there, obviously the best of libertarians.
[01:17:56.303 --> 01:17:58.624]  Do you think you're going to get the libertarian nomination?
[01:17:58.884 --> 01:17:59.985]  Well, let me put it this way.
[01:18:00.045 --> 01:18:02.327]  I started eight weeks ago in this race, and
[01:18:03.126 --> 01:18:05.050]  I'm already in the lead and the wind's at my back.
[01:18:05.411 --> 01:18:07.816]  I feel very, very secure of that, yes.
[01:18:08.077 --> 01:18:09.300]  I don't feel that's a problem at all.
[01:18:10.051 --> 01:18:12.653]  You know, I'm very secure in that situation.
[01:18:13.013 --> 01:18:22.941]  Okay, I want to shift gears here for a minute, because on your website you talk a lot about this phony war with Bush's business partner, Saddam, also his other business partner, Bin Laden.
[01:18:23.181 --> 01:18:23.421]  Right.
[01:18:23.802 --> 01:18:26.163]  But, I mean, this war is a total fraud.
[01:18:26.223 --> 01:18:28.145]  The troops are getting killed more and more every day.
[01:18:28.165 --> 01:18:29.446]  Yeah, five more yesterday, right?
[01:18:29.846 --> 01:18:30.947]  Yeah, well, today too.
[01:18:31.347 --> 01:18:33.169]  And they're covering up the numbers of dead.
[01:18:33.789 --> 01:18:35.450]  This war, what do you think about it?
[01:18:36.071 --> 01:18:37.192]  I think the war is a disgrace.
[01:18:37.859 --> 01:18:38.240]  I think.
[01:18:38.340 --> 01:18:42.585]  I mean, when we had shock and awe, to me it was so scary.
[01:18:44.427 --> 01:18:50.915]  The government is saying we're going to shock and awe these people, we're going to shock and awe them, and they end up blowing all these bombs up.
[01:18:51.425 --> 01:18:55.386]  And everybody in America sitting in front of their TV sets watching these giant explosions.
[01:18:55.426 --> 01:18:57.487]  Yeah, the Empire, the Empire.
[01:18:57.847 --> 01:18:59.588]  It was as if it was a fireworks show.
[01:18:59.908 --> 01:19:00.928]  You know, not really.
[01:19:00.948 --> 01:19:02.409]  There were people dying underneath it.
[01:19:02.429 --> 01:19:04.129]  There were little children being maimed.
[01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:07.911]  Did you know Domino's Pizza said that was their record sale night, better than the Super Bowl?
[01:19:08.071 --> 01:19:10.792]  Everybody sitting at home watching Shock and Awe, the fireworks exhibit.
[01:19:11.172 --> 01:19:12.132]  It was disgusting.
[01:19:12.352 --> 01:19:13.993]  I was embarrassed to be American that night.
[01:19:14.033 --> 01:19:14.593]  I really was.
[01:19:15.134 --> 01:19:16.675]  It made me sick to my stomach.
[01:19:16.715 --> 01:19:17.695]  The war is a diversion.
[01:19:17.715 --> 01:19:18.516]  It's about oil.
[01:19:18.776 --> 01:19:23.298]  And now Bush has made a joke where he looks under the desk, oh, where's the weapons of mass destruction?
[01:19:23.538 --> 01:19:24.598]  It's real funny now.
[01:19:24.959 --> 01:19:25.919]  Oh yeah, it's very funny.
[01:19:26.059 --> 01:19:26.339]  Right.
[01:19:26.939 --> 01:19:31.522]  You know, and Afghanistan was about getting pipelines to the Caspian Sea.
[01:19:31.882 --> 01:19:32.582]  That's what that was about.
[01:19:32.722 --> 01:19:33.502]  And the smack.
[01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:34.383]  What's that?
[01:19:34.703 --> 01:19:35.924]  It was also for the smack.
[01:19:35.964 --> 01:19:36.524]  Oh, the heroin?
[01:19:36.904 --> 01:19:37.224]  I see.
[01:19:37.244 --> 01:19:40.246]  Yeah, well, they're growing more than ever now that we're there.
[01:19:40.586 --> 01:19:42.166]  That's right.
[01:19:42.206 --> 01:19:43.307]  You know, I was friends
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.643]  With one of the people in the CFR.
[01:19:46.084 --> 01:19:46.725]  Hey, what, stay there.
[01:19:46.745 --> 01:19:47.806]  I want to hear about this when we get back.
[01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:50.891]  Aaron Russo, he's running for president as a libertarian.
[01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:51.612]  We'll be right back.
[01:19:51.632 --> 01:19:52.013]  Stay with us.
[01:19:53.931 --> 01:19:57.412]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:57.672 --> 01:20:01.194]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:20:01.274 --> 01:20:05.215]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:20:05.435 --> 01:20:11.597]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:12.017 --> 01:20:19.920]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:25.685]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:20:25.845 --> 01:20:29.608]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:29.969 --> 01:20:31.830]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:34.052]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:20:34.312 --> 01:20:39.237]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:20:39.277 --> 01:20:44.841]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438, and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:20:47.964 --> 01:20:49.771]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:21:00.544]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:21:00.964 --> 01:21:05.207]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:21:05.447 --> 01:21:12.472]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:21:12.853 --> 01:21:18.957]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:21:18.977 --> 01:21:20.318]  There are no side effects.
[01:21:20.658 --> 01:21:23.600]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.741]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:21:26.081 --> 01:21:33.325]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:37.007]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:21:37.427 --> 01:21:42.093]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[01:21:52.406 --> 01:21:53.386]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:53.466 --> 01:21:58.248]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:21:58.408 --> 01:22:06.211]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:06.471 --> 01:22:11.853]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:19.035]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:19.335 --> 01:22:24.679]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:29.682]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:22:30.002 --> 01:22:37.627]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:22:37.948 --> 01:22:43.431]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:22:44.512 --> 01:22:45.693]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:45.833 --> 01:22:48.034]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.355 --> 01:22:53.878]  Do you know a lot about the quality of air outside these days?
[01:22:53.958 --> 01:22:54.478]  Pollution?
[01:22:54.498 --> 01:22:54.779]  Pollution.
[01:22:54.819 --> 01:22:55.859]  Is it as healthy as you'd like?
[01:22:55.879 --> 01:22:56.400]  Allergies?
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:56.840]  Asthma?
[01:22:56.860 --> 01:22:57.420]  Probably not.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:22:58.321]  Well, listen to this.
[01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:07.527]  Did you know, according to the American Lung Association, combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside?
[01:23:07.547 --> 01:23:08.407]  6 to 10 times?
[01:23:08.447 --> 01:23:09.408]  How could that be, you ask?
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:15.801]  We're good to go.
[01:23:30.843 --> 01:23:43.412]  What this air cleaning system does is remove dangerous airborne particles like smoke, odors, VOCs, allergens, fine dust, mold, pollen, and kills bacteria for less than half the cost of other air purifiers, which do a lot less.
[01:23:43.492 --> 01:23:44.753]  Call them now to breathe easier.
[01:23:44.773 --> 01:23:44.833]  888-491-4100.
[01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:45.914]  The Puritech Pure Air System.
[01:23:46.014 --> 01:23:46.735]  Online at puritech.com.
[01:23:56.781 --> 01:23:57.281]  Don't worry.
[01:23:57.761 --> 01:23:59.282]  This show is documented.
[01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:02.582]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:02.982 --> 01:24:06.443]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:24:06.463 --> 01:24:10.984]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:24:11.544 --> 01:24:13.465]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:24:13.745 --> 01:24:14.965]  The Ring of Fire, baby!
[01:24:14.985 --> 01:24:17.226]  The Ring of Fire.
[01:24:17.246 --> 01:24:17.966]  The truth much?
[01:24:18.906 --> 01:24:23.116]  It's better to face the truth than to keep blindly stumbling around in the dark with all these pitfalls.
[01:24:23.877 --> 01:24:29.109]  Coming up in the next segment, we'll take your calls for presidential candidate Aaron Russo, Libertarian.
[01:24:30.347 --> 01:24:32.308]  And again, he got 30% of the vote in Nevada.
[01:24:32.348 --> 01:24:35.869]  He's very popular and very intelligent and a riveting speaker.
[01:24:35.929 --> 01:24:39.470]  And I would love to see him in the debates, but I don't think they're going to let him do that.
[01:24:39.510 --> 01:24:41.291]  But if there's enough pressure, maybe that'll happen.
[01:24:41.311 --> 01:24:42.991]  I mean, I'd pay to watch that.
[01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:45.252]  The total free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:24:45.272 --> 01:24:45.312]  800-259-9231.
[01:24:45.332 --> 01:24:48.213]  Now, the CFR is a group publicly sworn to set up a world government.
[01:24:56.236 --> 01:24:59.039]  Mr. Rizzo was saying you talked to a friend of his that's in the CFR.
[01:24:59.359 --> 01:25:00.019]  Please continue.
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:19.675]  Yeah, what I was saying was that, you know, coming out of the establishment, after I made Man of Hell, and right after I ran for governor, I was running for governor, rather, through a third-party source, I got a call from a CFR, you know, from a lawyer, who wanted me to meet with one of the Rockefeller family, and I did.
[01:25:21.611 --> 01:25:28.880]  This gentleman and I started hanging out and talking because he wanted to learn from me and I wanted to learn from him.
[01:25:29.561 --> 01:25:33.606]  And it was really, really quite amazing the way they look at the world.
[01:25:33.626 --> 01:25:39.553]  Many of them, not him necessarily, but many people in the CFR actually think they're doing the right thing.
[01:25:40.103 --> 01:25:41.424]  You know, they think the world is ours.
[01:25:41.444 --> 01:25:42.445]  Let me guess what they said.
[01:25:42.705 --> 01:25:42.905]  Yes.
[01:25:43.286 --> 01:25:44.827]  Aaron, the world is very dangerous.
[01:25:44.867 --> 01:25:56.377]  We have to be ruthless because all these other countries will get the weapons and, you know, we know best and we've got to organize society because people are so stupid and, you know, why don't you join the elite, Aaron?
[01:25:56.397 --> 01:25:57.218]  Why don't you be with us?
[01:25:57.939 --> 01:26:00.781]  Well, you pretty much hit it right on the head.
[01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:02.763]  You know, Aaron, what are you doing this for?
[01:26:03.446 --> 01:26:05.267]  You're a smart, successful guy.
[01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:07.328]  Come hang out with us.
[01:26:07.728 --> 01:26:09.589]  There's lots of business to do.
[01:26:09.689 --> 01:26:10.530]  There's many things.
[01:26:11.770 --> 01:26:25.097]  When everybody has their ID cards and their little chips and all those things, if anybody ever bothers you, yours will say, kiss my ass on it, and that way the cop who's bothering you will leave you alone.
[01:26:25.117 --> 01:26:26.117]  He'll know you're part of us.
[01:26:27.138 --> 01:26:31.760]  The attitude was that they know what's best for the world.
[01:26:33.434 --> 01:26:36.635]  People are just peasants, and they have no say in their own lives.
[01:26:37.195 --> 01:26:40.016]  And a lot of them think they're just doing the best thing for the world.
[01:26:40.236 --> 01:26:41.897]  And they're intent on that.
[01:26:42.357 --> 01:26:50.481]  And when you say, look, this is my life, I own my life, I'm private property to me, I'll live my life as I choose, not as you choose.
[01:26:50.501 --> 01:26:52.442]  What are you talking about?
[01:26:52.462 --> 01:26:54.482]  The world can't function that way.
[01:26:54.722 --> 01:26:55.343]  It's anarchy.
[01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:01.798]  Now, again, obviously it wasn't David Rockefeller.
[01:27:01.818 --> 01:27:03.019]  You want to tell us which Rockefeller?
[01:27:03.299 --> 01:27:03.900]  I'd rather not.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.361]  I'd rather not at the moment.
[01:27:05.421 --> 01:27:13.089]  So you had the CFR try to recruit you, and they said, hey, once you're in with us, you know, you're above the law, so don't worry what we do to the sheep.
[01:27:13.409 --> 01:27:16.612]  It's all those information and links and nods, you know.
[01:27:16.633 --> 01:27:17.794]  It's never blatant.
[01:27:18.757 --> 01:27:27.783]  You know, it's never really... Oh, I had one of the biggest networks five, six years ago try to recruit me, and they said, do you want to be a star, Alex, or on this crusade that's going nowhere?
[01:27:28.223 --> 01:27:29.965]  Here, here's your million-dollar contract.
[01:27:30.065 --> 01:27:30.725]  Join us.
[01:27:30.765 --> 01:27:32.747]  I mean, I've literally had the meeting with the devil.
[01:27:33.387 --> 01:27:37.510]  Yeah, and so have I. And it is the devil, and I really believe that.
[01:27:37.650 --> 01:27:41.332]  You know, it's real... I should say that it's evil.
[01:27:41.933 --> 01:27:44.875]  It's truly, truly evil, and I can't live that way.
[01:27:44.955 --> 01:27:46.456]  I like to think of myself, you know,
[01:27:46.903 --> 01:27:49.025]  As Mel Gibson did in Braveheart or Spartacus.
[01:27:49.125 --> 01:28:04.695]  I want to fight and I want to be in the forefront of the fight and restore individual freedom to America and bring back Thomas Jefferson and James Madison and all the great people who formed this country and gave us the greatest document in history of the world for self-governance.
[01:28:04.735 --> 01:28:15.343]  Well that's my point is that America is America because of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and now they say defend liberty give us your freedoms and by the way when the terror attack comes give up all your rights
[01:28:16.243 --> 01:28:18.124]  I mean, it's so ridiculous.
[01:28:18.144 --> 01:28:19.545]  They're killing this country.
[01:28:19.785 --> 01:28:23.327]  Bush says the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom, and in a way that's true.
[01:28:23.507 --> 01:28:26.428]  The globalists are the terrorists, and they attacked us to get our freedoms.
[01:28:27.309 --> 01:28:30.530]  And the truth is, they give us no choices.
[01:28:31.011 --> 01:28:32.952]  I mean, Bush and Kerry are the same person.
[01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:34.332]  I mean, it's ridiculous, you know.
[01:28:36.313 --> 01:28:37.314]  I use this analogy.
[01:28:37.374 --> 01:28:45.378]  Imagine this beautiful woman was in a terrible car accident, and her face was completely disfigured, and needs plastic surgery desperately.
[01:28:46.056 --> 01:28:50.798]  And so George Bush says, OK, let's put a little eyeliner on the right side of the face.
[01:28:50.898 --> 01:28:54.019]  And John Kerry says, let's put a little mascara on the left side of the face.
[01:28:54.279 --> 01:28:55.180]  And that's what we're going to do.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.300]  This country needs plastic surgery.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:59.461]  It needs an overhaul from top to bottom.
[01:28:59.641 --> 01:29:01.642]  We've lost everything that we ever had here.
[01:29:02.102 --> 01:29:03.303]  And we've got to restore it.
[01:29:03.343 --> 01:29:04.363]  We've got to bring it back.
[01:29:04.703 --> 01:29:05.503]  And that's what's necessary.
[01:29:05.543 --> 01:29:06.804]  And there's no one out there doing it.
[01:29:07.204 --> 01:29:12.266]  So I've decided to run and push it out there and use all my knowledge, everything I know in my life.
[01:29:12.711 --> 01:29:13.691]  To win this campaign.
[01:29:13.971 --> 01:29:15.212]  And I believe that we can do it.
[01:29:15.312 --> 01:29:15.972]  I really do.
[01:29:16.212 --> 01:29:17.513]  That we can actually tap in.
[01:29:17.873 --> 01:29:20.574]  And if you don't mind, I'd like to give out a phone number.
[01:29:20.594 --> 01:29:21.634]  Yeah, we're going to do that when we get back.
[01:29:21.714 --> 01:29:23.415]  I was about to, but we're out of time.
[01:29:23.455 --> 01:29:23.855]  You got it.
[01:29:24.095 --> 01:29:25.116]  Well, here it is once.
[01:29:25.136 --> 01:29:27.357]  You want a free info pack on the campaign.
[01:29:27.777 --> 01:29:27.957]  It's 877-279-9422.
[01:29:27.977 --> 01:29:28.017]  877-279-9422.
[01:29:28.077 --> 01:29:30.438]  You get a free info pack from Aaron Russo.
[01:29:30.458 --> 01:29:30.518]  877-279-9422.
[01:29:30.538 --> 01:29:32.358]  Give it out when we get back.
[01:29:44.142 --> 01:29:47.126]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.068 --> 01:29:50.752]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.982 --> 01:30:00.225]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.365 --> 01:30:06.529]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.809 --> 01:30:15.233]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.493 --> 01:30:22.517]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:27.640]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:33.264]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.604 --> 01:30:36.666]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:37.007 --> 01:30:44.932]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.032 --> 01:30:45.612]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.138 --> 01:30:55.159]  It's finally here!
[01:30:55.279 --> 01:30:56.259]  Spring has arrived!
[01:30:56.459 --> 01:30:59.421]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:30:59.641 --> 01:31:03.083]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:31:03.303 --> 01:31:11.468]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:31:11.729 --> 01:31:15.451]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[01:33:12.986 --> 01:33:13.327]  That's 877-279-9422.
[01:33:13.387 --> 01:33:15.027]  Or just go to his website.
[01:33:15.047 --> 01:33:17.828]  It's a great site, just full of information and what Mr. Russo stands for.
[01:33:32.694 --> 01:33:34.555]  Aaron, how many different websites do you have?
[01:33:34.595 --> 01:33:35.856]  Which website should we plug?
[01:33:36.396 --> 01:33:37.877]  RussoforPresident.com.
[01:33:38.278 --> 01:33:40.719]  That's the one I've got linked to on Infowars.com.
[01:33:40.779 --> 01:33:42.740]  RussoforPresident.com.
[01:33:43.261 --> 01:33:45.582]  Just a self-serving plug here.
[01:33:45.602 --> 01:33:52.747]  I was talking to you during a break and you were telling me that another credential you've got is that you bought Road to Tyranny about a year ago from me.
[01:33:52.787 --> 01:33:53.747]  What did you think of that video?
[01:33:53.888 --> 01:33:54.948]  I loved that video.
[01:33:55.288 --> 01:33:57.730]  I must tell you, I truly admire your work.
[01:33:57.850 --> 01:33:58.590]  I really, really do.
[01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:59.291]  You're a fighter.
[01:33:59.676 --> 01:34:03.499]  You stand up to what's going on in this country, you try as hard as you can to let people know.
[01:34:04.148 --> 01:34:07.209]  As much as they try to marginalize you, you're out there doing it.
[01:34:07.569 --> 01:34:18.832]  Well, here I am basking in the glow of Aaron Russo telling me I'm doing a good job, but I just want to point out that Aaron is taking action, further educating himself and involved, looking at all of this.
[01:34:19.152 --> 01:34:27.054]  We've got a whole bunch of phone calls here that I'm sure want to talk about every issue under the sun, and it all ties into why you're running for president against this tyranny.
[01:34:27.274 --> 01:34:29.815]  But before we do that, I know you've got a lot to talk about.
[01:34:29.895 --> 01:34:31.595]  Any other key points you want to hit on, Aaron?
[01:34:31.775 --> 01:34:35.418]  Well, I think it's very important that people have to learn about the military draft that's coming.
[01:34:36.018 --> 01:34:40.862]  You know, the Department of Defense put up on their website a posting calling for people to man the draft boards.
[01:34:41.482 --> 01:34:42.082]  And I took that.
[01:34:42.102 --> 01:34:44.784]  That's a universal draft, by the way, men and women.
[01:34:45.045 --> 01:34:47.406]  And you'll have to serve here domestically as their slaves.
[01:34:47.606 --> 01:34:50.088]  I tried to add all men and women between the ages of 18 and 26.
[01:34:51.818 --> 01:34:58.581]  And so I took their posting, I put it on my website, and as soon as I did that, within a day and a half, it was off of the Department of Defense's website.
[01:34:58.601 --> 01:35:05.003]  Yeah, that became a news item of why they pulled that, and they admit, I've had Ron Paul, Congressman, and others on, they're getting ready for a draft.
[01:35:05.403 --> 01:35:07.884]  One of the versions is to age 49!
[01:35:08.664 --> 01:35:11.566]  And it's professionals to be drafted and served domestically!
[01:35:11.746 --> 01:35:13.146]  Medical people, exactly.
[01:35:13.706 --> 01:35:14.106]  Exactly.
[01:35:14.146 --> 01:35:17.968]  Look, people, we're becoming, we are slaves to the government.
[01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:19.711]  It's time to stop it.
[01:35:19.971 --> 01:35:21.252]  There's no more time left.
[01:35:21.432 --> 01:35:24.954]  I'm out here doing my thing, my job, trying to run for president.
[01:35:25.175 --> 01:35:26.656]  We're doing a great job.
[01:35:27.036 --> 01:35:31.599]  And Aaron, you are doing a great job, but this isn't even a war to fight some real enemy.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:37.503]  No, this is a war that the Energy Commission, the PNAC documents admit, for oil and empire.
[01:35:38.123 --> 01:35:39.004]  There's no question.
[01:35:39.721 --> 01:35:40.802]  There's no question about it.
[01:35:41.162 --> 01:35:43.144]  So, you know, I'm just trying to give the people a choice.
[01:35:43.544 --> 01:35:45.445]  I say there really is a choice in this next election.
[01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:46.426]  Mobilize.
[01:35:46.566 --> 01:35:46.987]  Help me.
[01:35:47.007 --> 01:35:48.508]  You know, I can't do it alone.
[01:35:48.788 --> 01:35:50.890]  But I gotta tell you, we're really doing fantastic.
[01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:55.253]  And because I've come out of the establishment, I will be receiving lots of press.
[01:35:55.513 --> 01:35:57.154]  And I also believe I can make the debates.
[01:35:57.274 --> 01:35:57.855]  I believe that.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:35:59.701]  I honestly do, to the bottom of my heart.
[01:35:59.901 --> 01:36:01.383]  How do we help you do that?
[01:36:01.663 --> 01:36:03.745]  You don't look at the peak, you look at the first plateau.
[01:36:03.765 --> 01:36:04.886]  How do we help you do that?
[01:36:05.106 --> 01:36:05.827]  How do you help me?
[01:36:06.247 --> 01:36:16.075]  By going on the website, by volunteering to help, by making donations, by talking to your neighbors, by spreading the word, and saying, Russo's the guy for president, let's all get behind him.
[01:36:16.536 --> 01:36:25.904]  Let's do exactly what Ross Perot did, a grassroots audience, a grassroots campaign that tells the establishment, we're here to fight now.
[01:36:26.539 --> 01:36:29.180]  And we have someone who's running who you can't marginalize.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:33.040]  The beauty about me is it's hard to marginalize me.
[01:36:33.300 --> 01:36:34.861]  Let's talk to Mark in Minnesota.
[01:36:35.181 --> 01:36:36.021]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:36:36.081 --> 01:36:36.401]  Go ahead.
[01:36:36.441 --> 01:36:37.441]  Hey, how are you guys doing?
[01:36:37.461 --> 01:36:38.162]  Fine.
[01:36:38.202 --> 01:36:40.642]  I was actually holding on now since before... I understand.
[01:36:40.682 --> 01:36:41.322]  Go ahead.
[01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:45.503]  But what I said, there's a nexus here being that you're running for president, sir.
[01:36:46.583 --> 01:36:49.264]  I've noticed that whenever the U.S.
[01:36:49.324 --> 01:36:53.805]  government is hunting down this ghost al-Qaeda and ghost Taliban,
[01:36:54.426 --> 01:37:08.913]  They seem to surround and capture and kill and injure certain figures, and then right on cue, some LCIA, ISI, Taliban operative comes forward to say, oh no, we're alive, they're not dead.
[01:37:09.093 --> 01:37:12.774]  They don't even change the names, they kill the same people over and over again.
[01:37:12.794 --> 01:37:13.835]  Aaron, comments on that?
[01:37:14.135 --> 01:37:15.616]  El-Zahiri, excellent case.
[01:37:15.676 --> 01:37:20.838]  In fact, I'm kind of concerned because now they're saying that these LCIA operatives have nukes.
[01:37:21.574 --> 01:37:24.939]  And, uh, I know that at the end of December... Suitcase!
[01:37:24.999 --> 01:37:25.860]  Suitcase, Dukes!
[01:37:26.621 --> 01:37:29.065]  Uh, excuse me, December 2001 is all over the news.
[01:37:29.105 --> 01:37:31.248]  CNN, New York Times, El-Zahiri was killed!
[01:37:32.326 --> 01:37:39.712]  Then it turned into, you know, some of the shadowy Taliban figures stepped forward and said, no, he's still safe, he's alive.
[01:37:40.013 --> 01:37:40.573]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:37:40.613 --> 01:37:41.954]  Thanks for the call, Mark.
[01:37:42.014 --> 01:37:44.396]  And that's a segue into an important question.
[01:37:44.816 --> 01:37:48.499]  The globalists, we know 9-11 was only a pretext for control.
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:50.361]  They're now saying even bigger events.
[01:37:50.401 --> 01:37:52.382]  The government stands to gain from more attacks.
[01:37:52.943 --> 01:37:55.785]  And they're talking about even bigger attacks.
[01:37:55.825 --> 01:37:57.847]  I mean, clearly, this is scary.
[01:37:58.127 --> 01:38:00.309]  What do you see happening if there's another terror attack?
[01:38:00.749 --> 01:38:02.671]  Well, I think they're going to suspend the Constitution.
[01:38:03.372 --> 01:38:05.975]  In fact, two top generals have said that.
[01:38:05.995 --> 01:38:07.096]  Yeah, Wesley Clark said that.
[01:38:07.137 --> 01:38:07.537]  I know that.
[01:38:07.557 --> 01:38:07.877]  Who else?
[01:38:08.979 --> 01:38:11.261]  Well, we've had Tommy Franks.
[01:38:11.321 --> 01:38:11.722]  We've had...
[01:38:12.836 --> 01:38:16.279]  Excuse me, not Wesley Clark, I meant Tommy Franks.
[01:38:16.359 --> 01:38:18.900]  Franks has said stuff like that too, by the way.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:21.122]  So you were right on that too, even though you were wrong.
[01:38:21.922 --> 01:38:28.106]  And then on top of it, we've had the head of Northcom, General Eberhardt, there in Colorado Springs, where we're on the radio.
[01:38:28.126 --> 01:38:36.071]  But, you know, if we had you as president, you'd know how many continents there were, and you wouldn't say subliminal, and you'd know about missing suitcases.
[01:38:36.131 --> 01:38:39.874]  I don't know if you're good for president, because you actually know too much.
[01:38:40.695 --> 01:38:44.659]  Well, if I were President, you know, I would close down our bases overseas.
[01:38:44.719 --> 01:38:46.501]  I'd bring a lot of troops home to defend our borders.
[01:38:47.105 --> 01:38:53.688]  Stop all this illegal immigration, and once you start getting involved with other countries' problems, they become your problems.
[01:38:53.808 --> 01:38:54.448]  But look at you!
[01:38:54.468 --> 01:38:58.270]  You're quoting the founder of the country, George Washington, again!
[01:38:58.290 --> 01:38:59.110]  You can't be trusted!
[01:39:00.411 --> 01:39:05.593]  And what did you think in Road to Tyranny, where FEMA tells the police at the Founding Fathers that all Christians are terrorists?
[01:39:05.713 --> 01:39:06.373]  Oh, right, right!
[01:39:06.393 --> 01:39:07.333]  That was amazing!
[01:39:07.413 --> 01:39:09.554]  I had never heard that before in Toys'R'Us Road to Tyranny.
[01:39:09.854 --> 01:39:10.535]  That's incredible!
[01:39:10.675 --> 01:39:11.015]  Unbelievable!
[01:39:11.761 --> 01:39:15.482]  I mean, you know, it's so convoluted, it's so sick what's happening.
[01:39:16.002 --> 01:39:23.784]  There's so many instances and so many examples of this craziness that there's no choice but to stand up and try and get this thing back, get our country back.
[01:39:24.344 --> 01:39:25.505]  You know, what else are we going to do?
[01:39:25.525 --> 01:39:33.967]  I mean, we can sit here and complain about it and talk about it and have all our theories and all this experience, but the fact of the matter is we've got to take action.
[01:39:34.608 --> 01:39:35.348]  We need action.
[01:39:35.549 --> 01:39:42.013]  Well, I think, bottom line, you're going to get the word out, period, and certainly focus the debate into some real issues.
[01:39:42.373 --> 01:39:43.153]  Oh, I certainly will.
[01:39:43.193 --> 01:39:46.495]  I mean, we need your help, Alex, and I'm glad I'm on your show today talking about it.
[01:39:46.575 --> 01:39:50.117]  Well, we'll have you back up whenever you'd like, especially during the campaign.
[01:39:50.638 --> 01:39:52.059]  Let's talk to Mike in Canada.
[01:39:52.099 --> 01:39:52.879]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:39:52.919 --> 01:39:53.319]  Go ahead.
[01:39:53.339 --> 01:39:53.960]  Hi, thanks.
[01:39:55.701 --> 01:40:00.304]  If I lived over in the U.S., I would definitely vote for you, but I don't, so I went and fired off your
[01:40:01.690 --> 01:40:04.172]  Uh, that link to your website to all my American buddies.
[01:40:04.252 --> 01:40:06.934]  I have a lot of them over there, so... Great!
[01:40:07.355 --> 01:40:15.601]  I just wanted to point out that, um, I was going through a news article that I downloaded from InfoWars, uh, from November 27th, 2001.
[01:40:16.522 --> 01:40:18.704]  Did Bin Laden have help from U.S.
[01:40:18.804 --> 01:40:19.144]  friends?
[01:40:19.584 --> 01:40:26.410]  I noticed at the very bottom it said, This weekend, Spain announced it would not extradite suspected Al Qaeda terrorists to the U.S.
[01:40:26.490 --> 01:40:30.213]  as long as Bush plans to try such people in military tribunals.
[01:40:30.868 --> 01:40:35.510]  We should recall that the Taliban imposed conditions on their extradition offer too.
[01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:37.451]  Conditions the U.S.
[01:40:37.511 --> 01:40:38.451]  deemed unacceptable.
[01:40:38.531 --> 01:40:42.032]  Will Madrid be the anti-terror coalition's next target?
[01:40:43.973 --> 01:40:44.493]  Where was that?
[01:40:44.513 --> 01:40:46.694]  That was out of the Star.com.
[01:40:46.954 --> 01:40:47.214]  When?
[01:40:48.115 --> 01:40:48.795]  Uh, November 27, 2001.
[01:40:51.536 --> 01:40:52.516]  I'll remember that, yeah.
[01:40:52.876 --> 01:40:56.278]  Yeah, I was watching your, um, uh, 9-11 The Roteturney.
[01:40:56.318 --> 01:40:59.499]  I saw it on there and of course I started flipping through my papers because of what
[01:40:59.878 --> 01:41:08.142]  I'm trying to do is get a presentation set up so I can go through all these news articles at a veterans meeting.
[01:41:08.602 --> 01:41:15.825]  I've been getting pretty close and chummy with some World War II veterans over here that are getting messed over with their pensions and everything.
[01:41:15.845 --> 01:41:22.128]  I videotaped one of their question and answer sessions with the VA, which I'll be sending to you, Alex.
[01:41:24.136 --> 01:41:24.496]  I hear you.
[01:41:24.516 --> 01:41:26.256]  Thanks for what you're doing.
[01:41:26.276 --> 01:41:27.977]  Aaron, we have the most active audience out there.
[01:41:28.057 --> 01:41:29.657]  Every day they're having an effect.
[01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:49.191]  And we have the power.
[01:41:49.211 --> 01:41:52.792]  If the people move, the establishment has no control over us.
[01:41:52.972 --> 01:41:53.572]  Exactly.
[01:41:53.592 --> 01:41:54.492]  Just take the action.
[01:41:54.512 --> 01:41:55.853]  That's all it takes at this point.
[01:41:55.993 --> 01:41:59.374]  A lot of life is just showing up, isn't it?
[01:41:59.434 --> 01:42:00.174]  It's perspiration.
[01:42:00.194 --> 01:42:00.954]  It's not just showing up.
[01:42:00.994 --> 01:42:02.135]  It's also perspiration.
[01:42:02.495 --> 01:42:03.595]  So you've got to get in the game.
[01:42:03.715 --> 01:42:08.396]  You need the elbow grease.
[01:42:08.536 --> 01:42:13.378]  What I find most difficult is people talk about freedom, they say they want freedom, and they don't get involved.
[01:42:14.347 --> 01:42:15.248]  They sit and talk about it.
[01:42:15.268 --> 01:42:16.069]  They want to complain.
[01:42:16.169 --> 01:42:20.754]  Well, I think your run for the presidency is important, and I agree with your policies.
[01:42:20.794 --> 01:42:21.495]  I think you're great.
[01:42:21.675 --> 01:42:26.961]  At the same time, I think there should also be a big focus, as you did, running for governor, running for city council.
[01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:28.903]  Everybody, that's you!
[01:42:29.263 --> 01:42:30.645]  I'm talking to you out there!
[01:42:30.665 --> 01:42:32.167]  You need to run for office!
[01:42:32.247 --> 01:42:32.827]  That's right.
[01:42:33.248 --> 01:42:34.109]  Get busy.
[01:42:34.469 --> 01:42:36.071]  Run for, if you're a constitutionalist,
[01:42:36.411 --> 01:42:37.312]  You believe in the Bill of Rights?
[01:42:37.632 --> 01:42:38.773]  Run for office!
[01:42:38.993 --> 01:42:42.956]  And bottom line, you'll educate people that are politically active.
[01:42:43.656 --> 01:42:45.238]  Up next, who's up next?
[01:42:45.258 --> 01:42:46.178]  Who should I go to next?
[01:42:46.979 --> 01:42:48.640]  Maggie in Texas, go ahead Maggie.
[01:42:49.241 --> 01:43:02.771]  Hi Alex, during your last segment you broadcast a short list of those shadowy global entities like the Trilateral Commission and I believe the CFR and you also mentioned the
[01:43:03.496 --> 01:43:04.817]  Committee of 300.
[01:43:05.137 --> 01:43:12.964]  I'm wondering whether the Committee of 300 is based at UT, or is it simply similarly named to a UT committee?
[01:43:14.666 --> 01:43:16.407]  No, I would imagine it's similarly named.
[01:43:16.447 --> 01:43:21.292]  It's based in Rome, and it's just one more of these interlocking global directorates.
[01:43:21.432 --> 01:43:24.815]  Aaron, any comments on these shadow ruling elite?
[01:43:25.435 --> 01:43:26.616]  Well, we know what their intent is.
[01:43:26.696 --> 01:43:27.537]  It's about globalism.
[01:43:27.557 --> 01:43:28.438]  It's the one world order.
[01:43:28.974 --> 01:43:32.016]  And I don't know all their organizations.
[01:43:32.056 --> 01:43:36.920]  I mean, we know the Bilderbergers, the CFR, you know, the Charlotte Herald Commission, the Committee of 300, the Rome.
[01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:39.422]  But I mean, you know, it's just all part of the big game.
[01:43:39.702 --> 01:43:42.384]  You know, what really has to be stopped is the Federal Reserve.
[01:43:42.804 --> 01:43:44.686]  The Federal Reserve is what gives them so much power.
[01:43:44.886 --> 01:43:46.707]  Whoever coins the money makes the rules.
[01:43:47.067 --> 01:43:48.328]  Maggie, thanks for the call.
[01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:50.170]  You keep bringing up the Federal Reserve.
[01:43:50.290 --> 01:43:52.611]  It is the central point of their power in 1913.
[01:43:52.752 --> 01:43:56.474]  In a minute or two, break down what the Federal Reserve really is.
[01:43:56.995 --> 01:43:57.195]  Sure.
[01:43:58.902 --> 01:43:59.602]  You want me to do it now?
[01:43:59.842 --> 01:44:00.563]  Yeah, go ahead and do it.
[01:44:00.583 --> 01:44:01.023]  No, I'm sorry.
[01:44:01.303 --> 01:44:18.890]  Essentially, first of all, you should realize America has $72 trillion in unfunded liabilities, which means that money has to be created out of thin air, further destroying the currency we have in this country, or they have to renege on the debt, which would cause a huge depression.
[01:44:18.970 --> 01:44:25.553]  Essentially, what happens is, the Fair Reserve is a method of keeping all Americans on a plantation without them knowing it.
[01:44:25.773 --> 01:44:27.534]  It's like being a slave on a plantation.
[01:44:28.169 --> 01:44:33.593]  You go to borrow money from the bank, and they say, OK, we're going to put the money in your account.
[01:44:33.913 --> 01:44:36.875]  They hit their computer, and all of a sudden you have money in your account.
[01:44:37.015 --> 01:44:37.816]  Buy a computer.
[01:44:38.236 --> 01:44:39.117]  Where'd that money come from?
[01:44:39.137 --> 01:44:40.318]  It was created out of thin air.
[01:44:40.678 --> 01:44:41.899]  But now you have to work.
[01:44:42.304 --> 01:44:47.507]  The rest of your life to pay them back the principal and the interest on money that they made out of nothing.
[01:44:47.687 --> 01:44:51.749]  That they just created with zeros and ones and that's the monopoly.
[01:44:51.929 --> 01:44:54.091]  So the globals don't produce cars or computers.
[01:44:54.271 --> 01:44:55.111]  They produce nothing.
[01:44:55.732 --> 01:44:57.893]  They have a concession to make money for America.
[01:44:58.253 --> 01:45:00.274]  And now they have a concession to make money for the world.
[01:45:00.614 --> 01:45:08.699]  And by having that concession, by making the dollar the legal standard, you know, you have to accept Federal Reserve notes as legal money.
[01:45:09.238 --> 01:45:11.259]  That means that these people can own everything!
[01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:14.321]  And now... Because whoever borrows money, they control!
[01:45:14.681 --> 01:45:19.343]  And now they've decided to make the Euro the money, so they're plunging the dollar by over 40%.
[01:45:19.983 --> 01:45:29.548]  Well, what's happened with the dollar is, last year for example, you know, people are now saying that we're at $500 or $600 billion in deficit this year.
[01:45:29.928 --> 01:45:30.589]  That's not true.
[01:45:30.869 --> 01:45:32.990]  We're over a trillion dollars in deficit this year.
[01:45:33.490 --> 01:45:35.331]  And when I say that to people, they say, what do you mean?
[01:45:35.351 --> 01:45:35.891]  I've proved that.
[01:45:35.911 --> 01:45:37.312]  And it's very easy to prove.
[01:45:37.907 --> 01:45:48.013]  All you have to do is look at the national debt twelve months ago, look at the national debt today, and you'll see the increase in the national debt is over one trillion dollars.
[01:45:48.533 --> 01:45:49.614]  That is your deficit.
[01:45:50.154 --> 01:45:51.235]  That's your real deficit.
[01:45:51.495 --> 01:45:58.439]  So that means we are, every day of the year, we are going over three billion dollars in deficit every day.
[01:45:58.459 --> 01:46:00.380]  Okay, it can't continue.
[01:46:01.013 --> 01:46:02.254]  It cannot continue that way.
[01:46:02.815 --> 01:46:17.227]  And what's happening is, all of America, everybody's living off their credit cards, go to college, take a college loan... Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, Bush says that fast food is an industrial job, and we've added 4 million industrial jobs!
[01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:24.133]  It's so sick, it's so sick it's hard to even talk about it.
[01:46:24.193 --> 01:46:27.536]  His economic commission says exporting more jobs is good.
[01:46:28.411 --> 01:46:29.752]  Exporting war jobs is good.
[01:46:30.213 --> 01:46:32.654]  Yeah, I mean, what's wrong with you?
[01:46:32.715 --> 01:46:34.596]  You know, Alex, it's gone so far.
[01:46:35.076 --> 01:46:38.239]  It's so sick, you know, it's hard to even relate to it sometimes.
[01:46:38.319 --> 01:46:38.819]  No, it is.
[01:46:38.899 --> 01:46:41.241]  I feel like I'm in a surrealistic nightmare.
[01:46:41.301 --> 01:46:42.142]  That's what I was going to say.
[01:46:42.202 --> 01:46:45.865]  Rod Serling's about to walk in and say, in a place and time.
[01:46:46.205 --> 01:46:46.585]  Exactly.
[01:46:46.806 --> 01:46:51.029]  Even that shocking war, the war, I felt like it was like some bad B-movie.
[01:46:51.499 --> 01:46:53.080]  You know, I couldn't believe that was actually happening.
[01:46:53.340 --> 01:46:56.662]  The people all over America sitting there watching these buildings exploding.
[01:46:57.022 --> 01:47:02.484]  It was like Hitler bombarding, you know, major cities in Poland.
[01:47:02.504 --> 01:47:04.345]  You know, the Stukas.
[01:47:05.446 --> 01:47:06.526]  I missed the beginning of what you said.
[01:47:06.546 --> 01:47:09.948]  Well, no, I mean, it was like watching Hitler when he bombarded Poland.
[01:47:09.968 --> 01:47:10.188]  Exactly!
[01:47:10.568 --> 01:47:11.089]  Exactly!
[01:47:11.449 --> 01:47:17.952]  You know, I mean, I call Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Ashcroft the four pillars of fascism.
[01:47:18.427 --> 01:47:22.169]  You know, he talks about the axis of evil, but we really have to fear the four poles of fascism.
[01:47:22.829 --> 01:47:23.650]  That's the reality.
[01:47:23.970 --> 01:47:24.950]  Now let's take more calls.
[01:47:25.311 --> 01:47:27.812]  Russell in Texas, you're on the air with Aaron Russo, go ahead.
[01:47:28.437 --> 01:47:29.618]  Hey, fellas, God bless you both.
[01:47:29.658 --> 01:47:34.400]  Hey, listen, I got some Libertarian Party details to talk about in Texas that are pretty urgent.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:35.621]  Sure.
[01:47:35.921 --> 01:47:37.162]  We have a problem.
[01:47:37.482 --> 01:47:39.963]  Since 1986, we've retained ballot access.
[01:47:40.343 --> 01:47:41.364]  Right.
[01:47:41.584 --> 01:47:44.425]  Since 2002, we just fell short of the required election results.
[01:47:44.725 --> 01:47:44.965]  Yes.
[01:47:45.246 --> 01:47:51.409]  We have to collect 75,000 petition signatures to qualify, and we've got 53 days to do it.
[01:47:51.949 --> 01:47:53.890]  How many signatures do we have?
[01:47:54.010 --> 01:47:54.650]  I'm not sure.
[01:47:54.670 --> 01:47:57.732]  I got this from Pat Dixon, who's the chair of the ballot access committee.
[01:47:58.197 --> 01:47:58.397]  Right.
[01:47:58.417 --> 01:48:00.979]  Okay, well, we've got 53 days to do it.
[01:48:01.060 --> 01:48:02.160]  I don't know where we are now.
[01:48:03.041 --> 01:48:06.965]  This came out on the 10th, so at the 10th we needed 75,000 petitions.
[01:48:08.626 --> 01:48:09.367]  What's the end date?
[01:48:10.468 --> 01:48:11.028]  Let me see.
[01:48:15.132 --> 01:48:15.952]  I'll get to that in a second.
[01:48:16.713 --> 01:48:24.820]  One thing though, if we don't get it, if somehow we fail, we won't be able to try again until 2006 because of the state rules here.
[01:48:25.399 --> 01:48:27.161]  Right, they make it very tough on the third parties.
[01:48:27.221 --> 01:48:34.088]  Right, and, I mean, you know, you want to talk about what that would do, I mean, we've got a lot of local libertarians running in this state.
[01:48:34.148 --> 01:48:41.215]  It's a wonderful thing, and it's, it's, we've grown... Let me get Aaron's take on the CIA-run electronic voting machines.
[01:48:41.275 --> 01:48:44.058]  If you were president, would you order all those removed?
[01:48:45.148 --> 01:48:51.253]  Well, not only would I want to remove, I wouldn't be trashed and thrown out.
[01:48:51.513 --> 01:48:56.156]  I mean, the truth is, if you want to have electronic voting machines for speed, that's one thing.
[01:48:56.536 --> 01:49:03.101]  But if you're going to have electronic machines, it has to put out a paper ballot, it has to put out a paper result of how you voted.
[01:49:03.141 --> 01:49:08.325]  But the League of Women Voters is moving to block there being a record of how you vote.
[01:49:08.365 --> 01:49:09.726]  I mean, how obvious does it get?
[01:49:10.106 --> 01:49:12.347]  Well, you know we're at the endgame here.
[01:49:12.407 --> 01:49:13.088]  You know that, Alex?
[01:49:13.567 --> 01:49:15.288]  We're at the endgame, that's why we're doing what we're doing.
[01:49:15.628 --> 01:49:25.832]  But if you're going to have a ballot, an electronic machine, you have to print out a paper ballot, the person who voted looks at the ballot and says, yes, that's how I voted, and then they drop it in the ballot box.
[01:49:26.132 --> 01:49:27.572]  And it's only the paper that counts.
[01:49:28.093 --> 01:49:29.953]  That's the only way it can work.
[01:49:31.714 --> 01:49:33.975]  But I'm very curious what this gentleman is saying about Texas.
[01:49:35.235 --> 01:49:35.696]  Is he gone?
[01:49:35.716 --> 01:49:36.776]  No, he's still there!
[01:49:36.796 --> 01:49:38.237]  So what's our end date?
[01:49:40.156 --> 01:49:41.257]  I've been looking for that right now.
[01:49:41.297 --> 01:49:42.978]  I don't think the paper that I was sent has it.
[01:49:43.078 --> 01:49:44.618]  Didn't you say 50-something days?
[01:49:44.879 --> 01:49:47.160]  Yeah, we've got 53 days as of today.
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:49.000]  For 75,000 signatures?
[01:49:49.221 --> 01:49:49.461]  Right.
[01:49:49.661 --> 01:49:56.624]  And because we've got such a small time frame, we're going to have to use paid petitioners.
[01:49:57.545 --> 01:50:00.786]  I was in a Libertarian meeting speaking to the distinguished Libertarians.
[01:50:00.806 --> 01:50:02.127]  I heard it was great.
[01:50:02.227 --> 01:50:03.047]  I told the Libertarian Party
[01:50:07.282 --> 01:50:11.805]  I was going to donate $250,000 out of the first million dollars I raised for ballot access.
[01:50:12.565 --> 01:50:15.587]  Well, that would definitely, that's way more than we need here in the state.
[01:50:16.228 --> 01:50:25.273]  I want to thank you, and like I said, please contact the Texas Libertarian Party, lp.org if you want to link around to it.
[01:50:25.533 --> 01:50:27.355]  Okay, listen, I've got to let you go, we've got to go to a break.
[01:50:27.495 --> 01:50:29.636]  We'll come back and talk to Steve and Bruce and others.
[01:50:29.696 --> 01:50:30.336]  Okay, thank you.
[01:50:30.977 --> 01:50:32.518]  Final segment with Aaron Russo.
[01:50:33.351 --> 01:50:37.012]  And then when we get into the third hour, I'm going to news blitz for about 20-30 minutes.
[01:50:37.032 --> 01:50:37.792]  There's a lot of it.
[01:50:38.453 --> 01:50:39.713]  And then we'll go back to your calls.
[01:50:39.893 --> 01:50:41.794]  We've got about an hour and 10 minutes left.
[01:50:42.394 --> 01:50:44.494]  Stay with us, my friends.
[01:50:45.275 --> 01:50:46.255]  We shall return.
[01:50:47.035 --> 01:50:48.756]  And Russo for President dot com.
[01:50:48.776 --> 01:50:52.837]  My website's InfoWars dot com and PrisonPlanet dot com.
[01:50:54.057 --> 01:50:58.399]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.559 --> 01:51:02.920]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:05.316 --> 01:51:07.517]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:51:07.577 --> 01:51:10.437]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:51:10.697 --> 01:51:14.919]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:51:14.979 --> 01:51:21.900]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:24.041]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:24.301 --> 01:51:34.746]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:35.046 --> 01:51:40.428]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:52:01.219 --> 01:52:12.146]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:52:12.406 --> 01:52:14.207]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:52:14.487 --> 01:52:17.809]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:52:18.149 --> 01:52:28.575]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:52:28.895 --> 01:52:29.396]  That's right!
[01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:36.683]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:41.107]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[01:54:07.821 --> 01:54:13.247]  Alright, let's take a couple more calls for Aaron Russo, then a big news blitz, as I said, in the third hour that's coming up.
[01:54:14.019 --> 01:54:21.724]  Before we go back to Aaron Russo, I want to encourage every listener out there to get my documentary films you heard so much about, to get them and to make copies of them.
[01:54:21.744 --> 01:54:25.127]  You can make copies of my videos for non-profit, not-for-sale purposes.
[01:54:25.147 --> 01:54:30.530]  You want to air them on AXS TV, you want to give them to public officials, authorities, our lords.
[01:54:31.971 --> 01:54:39.452]  Get 9-11 Road to Tyranny, get Masters of Terror, get Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:54:39.472 --> 01:54:42.613]  They're $25, $95 apiece, $20 when you order 3 or more.
[01:54:42.633 --> 01:54:45.093]  I've also written a book, 9-11 Descent to Tyranny.
[01:54:45.113 --> 01:54:47.094]  I carry a lot of other great information.

[01:55:13.193 --> 01:55:15.434]  Let's go ahead and talk to Leon in Nevada.
[01:55:16.234 --> 01:55:17.214]  Leon, you're on the air.
[01:55:17.254 --> 01:55:17.694]  Go ahead.
[01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:20.495]  Hello, Alex, and hello, Mr. Russo.
[01:55:21.576 --> 01:55:22.416]  Hello.
[01:55:22.916 --> 01:55:26.117]  First of all, let me just say thank you for Alex Jones for this program.
[01:55:26.157 --> 01:55:29.399]  I'm telling you, this guy's great, and I'm really thrilled that he's having you on the air.
[01:55:29.419 --> 01:55:30.539]  Thank you.
[01:55:31.167 --> 01:55:38.072]  And what I'm curious about, do you have any kind of publicity packages or anything that people have access to?
[01:55:38.272 --> 01:55:39.013]  That's what we were saying.
[01:55:39.033 --> 01:55:45.518]  Go to the website or call 877-279-9422 and they'll send you one out free.
[01:55:45.698 --> 01:55:48.020]  Yeah, for the packages, call a phone number.
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:49.401]  For the website, get more information.
[01:55:49.421 --> 01:55:52.423]  But if you want the package, you call that 877 number.
[01:55:52.823 --> 01:55:54.605]  Absolutely, and I will certainly do that.
[01:55:55.501 --> 01:56:04.907]  As a person that has worked with you closely in the past, I'd like to tell the listeners that you are 100% genuine and that you would be a fantastic candidate.
[01:56:05.748 --> 01:56:07.849]  Oh, this is Leon from Nevada!
[01:56:07.909 --> 01:56:08.649]  Yes, sir, it is.
[01:56:08.809 --> 01:56:09.330]  Hi, Leon.
[01:56:09.370 --> 01:56:10.050]  How are you, buddy?
[01:56:10.230 --> 01:56:10.991]  I'm fine, thanks.
[01:56:11.591 --> 01:56:11.911]  Thank you.
[01:56:11.992 --> 01:56:13.172]  It's very sweet of you to call in.
[01:56:13.232 --> 01:56:13.733]  Thank you.
[01:56:13.853 --> 01:56:15.093]  Leon, finish up.
[01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:15.514]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:56:15.854 --> 01:56:19.056]  I just wanted to say that, you know, you're a fantastic candidate.
[01:56:19.156 --> 01:56:20.537]  I was hoping that, you know,
[01:56:20.919 --> 01:56:25.981]  There are going to be a lot of packages or something that people can put together to get out and go door-to-door or something.
[01:56:26.321 --> 01:56:30.723]  I've been working here in Nevada to try to get people motivated, and it's very difficult to get people off their couch.
[01:56:30.743 --> 01:56:34.265]  Well, you guys got 30% of the vote in the governor run, so that's a big deal.
[01:56:34.285 --> 01:56:34.885]  Thanks for the call.
[01:56:35.445 --> 01:56:39.046]  Let's talk to... Let's go to Bruce in Colorado.
[01:56:39.066 --> 01:56:39.807]  Bruce, go ahead.
[01:56:40.867 --> 01:56:41.347]  Thank you very much.
[01:56:41.487 --> 01:56:42.288]  I appreciate it.
[01:56:42.308 --> 01:56:43.428]  I finally made it on here.
[01:56:43.468 --> 01:56:43.788]  You bet.
[01:56:43.808 --> 01:56:44.269]  Go ahead.
[01:56:44.849 --> 01:56:45.509]  Thank all you guys.
[01:56:45.529 --> 01:56:46.329]  You're doing a great job.
[01:56:46.590 --> 01:56:48.670]  I am running on a libertarian party this year.
[01:56:48.710 --> 01:56:49.591]  I had last year.
[01:56:50.743 --> 01:56:51.704]  Actually, I was with Ross Perot.
[01:56:51.744 --> 01:56:53.566]  Do me a really big favor and turn your radio off.
[01:56:54.587 --> 01:56:54.947]  Okay, sir.
[01:56:55.768 --> 01:56:58.351]  Actually, I started with Ross Perot.
[01:56:58.391 --> 01:56:58.992]  I like him.
[01:56:59.012 --> 01:57:03.396]  Then I ran on Reform Party, then Fab Buchanan, then Libertarian Party.
[01:57:04.097 --> 01:57:06.880]  I'm running just for... I'm starting at the bottom, like you said.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:08.441]  Nobody will run out here.
[01:57:08.842 --> 01:57:13.987]  And so it's one county's all Republican, one's all Democrat, and I've been in one county's all Republican.
[01:57:14.318 --> 01:57:16.340]  Every time they have county commissioners, nobody's challenging them.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:17.621]  So I've got to get up and do it.
[01:57:17.721 --> 01:57:21.264]  And I've come pretty close, about 2,000-3,000 votes short.
[01:57:21.284 --> 01:57:24.808]  Well, Aaron Russo started the constitutional party that Howard Phillips heads up.
[01:57:24.888 --> 01:57:28.030]  I mean, he's done a lot of great work, and I think it's all wonderful.
[01:57:28.551 --> 01:57:31.073]  Well, what we're having, I don't know if Russo can make it out there.
[01:57:31.093 --> 01:57:37.879]  We're going to have our state convention here on May, I think it's the 21st or 22nd on a weekend there.
[01:57:37.899 --> 01:57:39.161]  I don't know if he's going to be around.
[01:57:39.181 --> 01:57:40.282]  I'm not sure what's going to come out here.
[01:57:41.144 --> 01:57:45.005]  State Convention here, the Libertarian Party.
[01:57:46.065 --> 01:57:54.927]  Also, I want to, I want you to come out, our biggest problem out here is immigration, illegals, we have a lot of people that are driving illegal car accidents.
[01:57:55.087 --> 01:57:57.367]  Gotta let you go, we're unfortunately out of time.
[01:57:57.908 --> 01:58:01.708]  Aaron Russo, how would you handle the illegal alien situation?
[01:58:01.808 --> 01:58:09.230]  I've been very clear with the Libertarian Party, with everybody, you know, as long as America is a welfare state, you can't have open borders, and I believe you have to
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:10.542]  We're good to go.
[01:58:18.291 --> 01:58:20.933]  I'm happy to redistribute the wealth of another group and give it to them.
[01:58:21.294 --> 01:58:21.954]  It's ridiculous.
[01:58:22.194 --> 01:58:25.457]  All right, Aaron Russo, we'll have you back on the show, and God bless you and Godspeed.
[01:58:25.897 --> 01:58:29.400]  Thank you, God bless you, and all you can do is much appreciated.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.601]  You bet, my friend, take care.
[01:58:30.621 --> 01:58:31.282]  All right, buddy.
[01:58:31.682 --> 01:58:37.207]  All right, russoverpresident.com, third hour, ton of news, more of your calls straight ahead.
[01:58:37.267 --> 01:58:38.227]  First, we'll cover some news.
[01:58:38.568 --> 01:58:40.589]  You do not want to miss this information, very important.
[01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:42.431]  Stay with us, third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:44.483 --> 01:58:55.214]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:58:55.414 --> 01:59:03.002]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:03.242 --> 01:59:06.365]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:59:06.645 --> 01:59:12.392]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:59:12.673 --> 01:59:18.840]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[01:59:19.201 --> 01:59:23.085]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[01:59:23.146 --> 01:59:25.008]  The water level is always visible.
[01:59:25.208 --> 01:59:31.153]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:59:31.374 --> 01:59:35.337]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:35.357 --> 01:59:36.058]  That's toll free, triple 8, 803-4438.
[01:59:50.678 --> 01:59:51.339]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.999 --> 01:59:53.040]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.760 --> 01:59:54.881]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.522 --> 01:59:56.342]  You want answers?
[01:59:57.103 --> 01:59:58.024]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.664 --> 02:00:02.427]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.848 --> 02:00:06.971]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.373 --> 02:00:10.593]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:11.814 --> 02:00:17.559]  We're now into Hour 3 of this global transmission against tyranny.
[02:00:19.719 --> 02:00:23.002]  And we're going to continue with your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:00:25.184 --> 02:00:30.609]  Last hour, I got into part of the article, found the 9-11 stand down order.
[02:00:32.111 --> 02:00:36.595]  Jim Hoffman has discovered a document which I believe may be very important to the 9-11 skeptic movement.
[02:00:36.875 --> 02:00:40.018]  The document supersedes earlier DOD procedures.
[02:00:40.739 --> 02:00:42.741]  And as of June 1st, 2001, there was an order put out
[02:00:44.645 --> 02:00:50.327]  Well, the Joint Chiefs, the generals could no longer shoot down derelict or hijacked aircraft.
[02:00:50.467 --> 02:00:52.348]  They had to all go through Rumsfeld.
[02:00:52.888 --> 02:00:55.249]  So another reason they didn't shoot down aircraft.
[02:00:56.090 --> 02:00:56.890]  Very, very interesting.
[02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:58.671]  We'll get into more of that.
[02:00:58.691 --> 02:01:07.354]  There have been these horrible bombings taking place over in Iraq, in Falljala, and outside Baghdad.
[02:01:08.044 --> 02:01:09.846]  Killed a bunch, what, five troops.
[02:01:09.926 --> 02:01:11.047]  Six died on Monday.
[02:01:11.747 --> 02:01:16.571]  They're dragging dead bodies around, hanging them from stuff, and no one will say if it's troops or not.
[02:01:16.631 --> 02:01:18.533]  The media is acting strangely on that.
[02:01:19.594 --> 02:01:20.935]  So, very, very serious there.
[02:01:20.955 --> 02:01:31.504]  We have some of the horrific photos on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as the Iraqis drag dead bodies to the streets, which are probably troops, but the media isn't really trying to focus in on that.
[02:01:32.245 --> 02:01:34.587]  And it's just a horrible position for our troops to be in.
[02:01:35.613 --> 02:01:39.874]  Over there, taking over this area for the oil from the PNAC documents.
[02:01:40.974 --> 02:01:42.834]  So, we can discuss that.
[02:01:43.374 --> 02:01:44.875]  Some of the other stories.
[02:01:45.035 --> 02:01:49.215]  Terror panic could turn Britain into a police state, says government officials.
[02:01:50.096 --> 02:02:03.438]  After several terrorist suspects were arrested yesterday, the Liberal Democrat leader warned against the establishment of a police state and said emergency measures introduced by the Home Secretary to protect Britain from terrorists were draconian, close quote.
[02:02:04.221 --> 02:02:10.585]  Mr. Kennedy at an event in London hosted by the Independent acknowledged that the threat from Al-Qaeda meant changes needed to be made.
[02:02:10.645 --> 02:02:11.985]  See, it's fake left-right stuff.
[02:02:12.666 --> 02:02:22.011]  To protect society, but he said prospects to restrict the right to trial and lower the burden of proof jettisoned the fundamentals of the rule of law that would not solve the long-term problem.
[02:02:22.331 --> 02:02:26.153]  They were trying to get rid of juries in England before 9-11.
[02:02:26.173 --> 02:02:29.875]  And again, they're getting rid of them for everybody and it has nothing to do with terror.
[02:02:30.436 --> 02:02:32.857]  It's like the Patriot Act written for the general public here,
[02:02:33.852 --> 02:02:34.872]  In non-terror cases.
[02:02:35.332 --> 02:02:49.276]  And now the federal courts, Supremes, and the Fifth Circuit ruling, hey, there's no Fourth Amendment, hey, there's no Fifth Amendment, you know, gotta answer a cop's questions or that's resisting, and then you get charged with basically assaulting them for not answering them.
[02:02:50.517 --> 02:02:55.698]  This is very, very serious, and it's happening all over the world.
[02:02:56.758 --> 02:03:00.059]  And you need to ask yourself, why is this happening?
[02:03:00.159 --> 02:03:01.760]  Why is this going on?
[02:03:01.840 --> 02:03:02.960]  Why are we putting up with this?
[02:03:04.466 --> 02:03:06.547]  And another story out of the BBC.
[02:03:07.188 --> 02:03:09.249]  How revealing is an x-ray scanner?
[02:03:09.489 --> 02:03:11.691]  And you've all seen the images of the naked people.
[02:03:11.711 --> 02:03:16.154]  They're not naked physically, but they're walking through crisp images of their bare bodies.
[02:03:17.034 --> 02:03:21.757]  And it says, just as luggage is systematically x-rayed to see what's inside, the M.E.T.
[02:03:21.817 --> 02:03:27.941]  police have tested a scanner which looks through the clothes for drugs and concealed weapons, but is modesty preserved?
[02:03:28.502 --> 02:03:30.263]  It shows a photo here of a naked man.
[02:03:31.201 --> 02:03:33.383]  I mean, you're talking crisp, folks.
[02:03:33.604 --> 02:03:34.885]  This goes right through the clothes.
[02:03:36.226 --> 02:03:41.972]  In just six seconds, an x-ray scanner can produce a 360-digital image of the body minus clothes.
[02:03:42.092 --> 02:03:43.634]  And it's also biometric, by the way.
[02:03:44.355 --> 02:03:46.657]  And it's recorded digitally, by the way.
[02:03:47.118 --> 02:03:50.141]  This is no coy version of James Bond x-ray specs.
[02:03:50.851 --> 02:03:56.155]  In which 007 can see hidden guns and saucy underwear, which lie beneath the villain's garments.
[02:03:56.315 --> 02:04:15.010]  What shows up is a naked human form, and anything concealed on the person, coins in a pocket, trousers, studs, metal or chromatic knives, guns, explosives, drugs, the shin bones, which lie close to the skin surface, can also be seen as can features such as the client's cleft of the buttocks.
[02:04:17.091 --> 02:04:18.632]  We've posted these photos many times.
[02:04:18.692 --> 02:04:20.392]  I mean, your wife, your children, you.
[02:04:20.812 --> 02:04:21.412]  You walked up.
[02:04:21.792 --> 02:04:23.213]  Dozens of airports have these.
[02:04:23.553 --> 02:04:29.275]  Five airports have the NASA brain scanner that cat scans your brain to see if it's heated up or angry.
[02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:31.335]  Oh, sir, it shows you're angry.
[02:04:31.355 --> 02:04:32.016]  Are you a terrorist?
[02:04:32.476 --> 02:04:34.136]  I mean, how Orwellian is this?
[02:04:34.216 --> 02:04:35.237]  Scanning our brains?
[02:04:35.597 --> 02:04:36.877]  Looking at our naked bodies?
[02:04:37.537 --> 02:04:38.718]  It's not freedom!
[02:04:40.238 --> 02:04:43.299]  But the article is how it keeps us all safe, so go ahead and submit to it.
[02:04:46.562 --> 02:04:49.004]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[02:04:49.365 --> 02:04:53.288]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[02:04:53.688 --> 02:04:56.331]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[02:04:56.611 --> 02:04:57.291]  Important news.
[02:04:57.371 --> 02:05:00.094]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.

[02:05:46.141 --> 02:05:49.024]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:05:49.728 --> 02:05:51.010]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:06:07.109 --> 02:06:10.870]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:06:11.150 --> 02:06:15.792]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:06:15.852 --> 02:06:22.114]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:06:22.174 --> 02:06:23.935]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:06:45.071 --> 02:06:46.672]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:06:47.033 --> 02:06:52.777]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:06:53.038 --> 02:06:58.162]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:06:58.502 --> 02:07:07.790]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[02:07:42.307 --> 02:07:43.428]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:46.390 --> 02:07:48.592]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:49.173 --> 02:07:51.955]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:07:55.382 --> 02:08:02.364]  Video cameras in school bathrooms put there officially by school districts is not America, is not freedom.
[02:08:03.685 --> 02:08:08.526]  Cameras that were on the highways that are now in our neighborhoods here in Austin isn't freedom.
[02:08:08.707 --> 02:08:10.167]  And they admit it's for law enforcement.
[02:08:10.187 --> 02:08:12.308]  They now have microphones on them as well.
[02:08:12.408 --> 02:08:14.208]  And yes, it has dual use for traffic.
[02:08:15.669 --> 02:08:18.950]  Police in black ski masks running around in armored vehicles isn't freedom.
[02:08:21.661 --> 02:08:22.862]  I think it's the last time I saw.
[02:08:23.002 --> 02:08:26.183]  Over 20 airports now have the scanners that look right through your clothes.
[02:08:26.584 --> 02:08:33.187]  You are totally naked and they digitally record a 360 view of your naked body!
[02:08:33.207 --> 02:08:38.309]  I mean, would you let your neighbor take nude photos of you?
[02:08:38.329 --> 02:08:41.791]  How about you have your neighbor come take nude photos of your wife?
[02:08:42.952 --> 02:08:48.334]  That's not America and the sickos out there in government that are trying to sell us this.
[02:08:48.635 --> 02:08:51.176]  What is wrong with you people putting up with this?
[02:08:52.566 --> 02:08:55.611]  I mean, how am I going to be able to fly here in the future when I need to?
[02:08:55.831 --> 02:09:00.077]  How are you going to walk your family through and let them scan you?
[02:09:00.097 --> 02:09:01.359]  They're doing this to everybody!
[02:09:04.123 --> 02:09:05.105]  It's incredible!
[02:09:06.164 --> 02:09:08.525]  I mean, what type of humiliation will you take?
[02:09:08.565 --> 02:09:14.288]  Imagine growing up and hearing, oh, in Russia they make their people go through x-ray machines that give them nude photos of them.
[02:09:14.388 --> 02:09:15.129]  Oh, the Russians.
[02:09:15.389 --> 02:09:16.390]  Those bad commies.
[02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:22.893]  But we do it, and it's Rush Limbaugh telling us how good it is and how we need to accept it.
[02:09:22.933 --> 02:09:25.935]  And Sean Hannity, every child needs a microchip.
[02:09:26.335 --> 02:09:27.055]  Oh, it's so great.
[02:09:27.075 --> 02:09:29.897]  I got a clip of that in my Masters of Terror video.
[02:09:31.095 --> 02:09:35.976]  These people are bonkers in their control, and they're just trying to sell us all this.
[02:09:36.936 --> 02:09:48.059]  And so this article in the BBC, oh yeah, it says you're totally naked, and that, you know, it's a good thing, and, you know, let's just accept this!
[02:09:49.239 --> 02:09:51.760]  And let them record your naked body, you and your family.
[02:09:53.140 --> 02:09:55.881]  I mean, it's just, it's off the scales.
[02:09:57.262 --> 02:09:58.583]  I actually reprinted it.
[02:09:58.603 --> 02:10:01.045]  It's still on the legislature's website of Oregon.
[02:10:01.065 --> 02:10:02.225]  It almost passed last year.
[02:10:04.467 --> 02:10:08.830]  Where you get life in prison if one protester blocks traffic.
[02:10:09.630 --> 02:10:11.792]  Because every time I mention this article, people can't believe it.
[02:10:12.072 --> 02:10:12.812]  I can't believe it.
[02:10:12.832 --> 02:10:14.513]  It amends, by the way, Chapter 666.
[02:10:15.494 --> 02:10:17.676]  And the puns continue, the real-life puns.
[02:10:18.336 --> 02:10:19.597]  Guess what the name of the senator is?
[02:10:19.717 --> 02:10:20.037]  Menace.
[02:10:20.077 --> 02:10:21.698]  And I know I've been talking about this a lot lately.
[02:10:22.179 --> 02:10:25.461]  I mean, they tried to pass martial law up in
[02:10:26.897 --> 02:10:28.478]  Providence, Rhode Island a month ago.
[02:10:28.578 --> 02:10:29.759]  I mean, it said it in the bill.
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:32.021]  We got top generals talking about it.
[02:10:32.401 --> 02:10:33.883]  I mean, folks, it's happening!
[02:10:34.383 --> 02:10:35.824]  History's repeating itself.
[02:10:36.224 --> 02:10:38.827]  It's happening yet again.
[02:10:38.847 --> 02:10:39.687]  And then I got this article.
[02:10:41.869 --> 02:10:45.392]  Salons enlisted to provide information.
[02:10:45.512 --> 02:10:47.093]  And I've looked at the actual program.
[02:10:47.133 --> 02:10:50.696]  It's to tattletale to the government if a woman has a bruise on her.
[02:10:52.515 --> 02:10:58.497]  So now if your child, your wife, your husband, anybody falls down, anybody's got a bruise, go ahead and report it as the Secret Police.
[02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:00.838]  Well, it'll stop people being beaten.
[02:11:00.898 --> 02:11:05.740]  I mean, it's just, there's never an end to any of it.
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:10.461]  San Francisco libraries are putting tracker chips in their stuff.
[02:11:10.842 --> 02:11:12.322]  Here's one out of DM Europe.
[02:11:12.882 --> 02:11:20.045]  Dutch public libraries developed Big Brother Chip, the largest supplier of books to Dutch libraries, NBB Biblin,
[02:11:21.187 --> 02:11:25.809]  He's going high-tech and is planning to replace the barcode on his books with electronic chips.
[02:11:25.849 --> 02:11:27.890]  See, everything's shifting to that to track and trace you.
[02:11:29.891 --> 02:11:36.054]  And, uh, well, I got a photo on the website of Dover Air Force Base mortuary procedures that are all secret.
[02:11:37.075 --> 02:11:38.516]  They won't let anybody get these photos.
[02:11:38.536 --> 02:11:43.098]  You gotta get government-approved photos released, and it's all these planes full of coffins.
[02:11:45.639 --> 02:11:46.640]  Very, very serious.
[02:11:46.720 --> 02:11:49.461]  In Britain, one in five pregnancies ends in abortion.
[02:11:50.689 --> 02:11:59.471]  London Telegraph, more than 1 in 5 pregnancies in Britain ends in abortion, while the number of childless women over 40 increases substantially according to new figures.
[02:12:01.092 --> 02:12:06.553]  And of course, 1 in 10 in England is now on a Prozac-type drug, and that number's expanding.
[02:12:07.273 --> 02:12:10.354]  The Reverend Jackson, you know, who talks like that.
[02:12:11.134 --> 02:12:13.535]  Limbaugh loves to make fun of him, but his own bosses love him.
[02:12:14.055 --> 02:12:18.176]  The Reverend Jesse Jackson to host weekly talk show on Clear Channel Radio Network.
[02:12:20.402 --> 02:12:21.403]  Yeah, just amazing.
[02:12:21.683 --> 02:12:24.044]  It says, liberal voices getting new home on the radio.
[02:12:24.664 --> 02:12:25.605]  Liberal voices?
[02:12:25.625 --> 02:12:27.206]  I mean, what do you call the people that are on?
[02:12:27.606 --> 02:12:35.911]  I mean, if big government's your yardstick for liberalism, then nobody's more liberal than George W. Bush.
[02:12:37.411 --> 02:12:41.654]  Nobody is more liberal than George W. Bush.
[02:12:41.934 --> 02:12:47.477]  You know, we talked about over the last five years, and this counts the spikes during war coverage,
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:56.784]  That the broadcast media and cable media, period, not just news, has lost 35 to 40 plus percent, depending on what poll you look at, what study.
[02:12:57.805 --> 02:12:59.065]  I should say study, not poll.
[02:13:00.046 --> 02:13:00.886]  And here's another one.
[02:13:01.206 --> 02:13:05.448]  Prices at cable, CNN loses half of its audience from a year ago.
[02:13:06.509 --> 02:13:11.251]  And Fox News has lost 36 percent of its viewers.
[02:13:11.831 --> 02:13:17.534]  By the way, our listenership roughly triples on average every year.
[02:13:18.115 --> 02:13:20.738]  That's just on the areas we can gauge it, such as the internet.
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:27.727]  I don't know, we were getting about 5 million individual visitors a year ago on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:13:28.067 --> 02:13:30.630]  It's actually quadrupled there to 20 million a month.
[02:13:31.351 --> 02:13:32.493]  We're just one website!
[02:13:32.933 --> 02:13:33.894]  One radio show!
[02:13:33.934 --> 02:13:35.236]  People are sick of you!
[02:13:35.496 --> 02:13:37.399]  People aren't buying your lies, you criminals!
[02:13:38.129 --> 02:13:42.291]  We don't think scanners in airports that videotape us naked are freedom.
[02:13:42.771 --> 02:13:45.052]  We don't think cameras in school bathrooms are freedom.
[02:13:45.492 --> 02:13:51.115]  We don't think black helicopters looking through our walls with ground-penetrating radar, which is admitted, is freedom.
[02:13:51.715 --> 02:13:52.936]  We don't think it's freedom.
[02:13:53.036 --> 02:13:54.056]  Sorry!
[02:13:54.516 --> 02:13:56.097]  We don't think open borders are freedom.
[02:13:56.337 --> 02:13:58.938]  We don't think hamburger jobs are industrial jobs.
[02:13:59.158 --> 02:14:01.179]  We don't think outsourcing more jobs is good.
[02:14:01.399 --> 02:14:02.920]  We don't buy your lies anymore!
[02:14:04.099 --> 02:14:07.962]  And so the mainstream media keeps saying, everyone buys the lies, everyone believes us.
[02:14:08.222 --> 02:14:13.867]  When in truth, more and more aren't believing them, but even those that don't believe the media think they're still all alone.
[02:14:14.127 --> 02:14:15.828]  That's the part of the lie they're still buying.
[02:14:16.028 --> 02:14:17.609]  We are not all alone!
[02:14:17.970 --> 02:14:19.171]  We are the majority!
[02:14:21.112 --> 02:14:27.417]  I got a little cable show I've been doing, coming up on 10 years, a radio show here in Austin, and I, half the people in grocery stores,
[02:14:28.766 --> 02:14:32.067]  Convenience stores, movie theaters, the mall, whatever.
[02:14:32.147 --> 02:14:34.248]  Walking my dog, stop, talk to me, agree.
[02:14:34.288 --> 02:14:35.429]  Black, white, old, young.
[02:14:37.509 --> 02:14:38.510]  We're winning, okay?
[02:14:38.530 --> 02:14:40.591]  The problem is we don't have the power structures.
[02:14:42.311 --> 02:14:44.232]  Smart cameras to watch over London Tube.
[02:14:44.872 --> 02:14:57.417]  The four million closed-circuit televisions that are in England are now all being fitted with face-scanning software and brain-scanning, and they've also got the... that looks at your walk, to the side of your walk, is aggressive.
[02:14:58.442 --> 02:14:59.023]  Very interesting.
[02:14:59.603 --> 02:15:05.067]  Also, Indiana Statesman did an article, Bill of Rights no longer valid in Louisiana.
[02:15:05.648 --> 02:15:06.389]  Great story.
[02:15:07.529 --> 02:15:20.540]  And it says, one week ago today, March 24th, a New Orleans-based fiscal court of appeals handed down a ruling effectively giving Louisiana cops the green light to conduct searches of personal residences and businesses without a search warrant.
[02:15:21.027 --> 02:15:31.052]  The ruling in United States v. Kelly Gould was in response to an appeal made by a Mr. Gould after three firearms were found in his residence following an illegal search.
[02:15:31.892 --> 02:15:36.774]  He goes on to what the ruling means, and I heartily agree you should go read the article.
[02:15:38.295 --> 02:15:39.595]  Oh, there's so much more here.
[02:15:40.016 --> 02:15:47.379]  Later in the hour, I'm going to read over some of Senate Bill 742, because people can't believe this, and I'm going to read over it again.
[02:15:48.234 --> 02:15:54.819]  About putting you in a forest labor camp for life if one protester blocks traffic, everyone gets life in prison.
[02:15:55.039 --> 02:15:59.122]  And I wanted to read some of the other crimes you get life in prison for if they're able to pass this.
[02:16:01.303 --> 02:16:02.504]  And here's the deal.
[02:16:04.505 --> 02:16:07.688]  I'm gonna take calls, and I'm giving each caller, and I want to hear from you.
[02:16:07.808 --> 02:16:08.488]  We love you to death.
[02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:15.093]  But I don't like the fact that people tell me they can't get into the show for weeks sometimes because the phones get loaded up and we don't get to them.
[02:16:15.709 --> 02:16:18.932]  I'm going to give each caller a minute, and I'm not going to interrupt you.
[02:16:19.533 --> 02:16:23.817]  Questions, comments, anything you want to talk about, you've got 60 seconds.
[02:16:23.837 --> 02:16:24.177]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:16:24.197 --> 02:16:28.061]  1-800-259-9231 on this live Wednesday edition.
[02:16:38.590 --> 02:16:44.874]  We got about 43 minutes, 42 minutes left in this transmission against tyranny.
[02:16:45.334 --> 02:16:47.775]  We're going to load the phones back up and take your calls.
[02:16:48.015 --> 02:16:48.456]  Bam!
[02:16:48.816 --> 02:16:49.276]  Bam!
[02:16:49.536 --> 02:16:49.836]  Bam!
[02:16:49.876 --> 02:16:52.498]  I'll take three or four calls, cover a couple news articles.
[02:16:52.538 --> 02:16:54.799]  Three or four calls, cover a couple of news articles.
[02:16:54.839 --> 02:16:58.341]  Got a whole other stack of stuff here and some top stories I'm going to recap.
[02:16:58.941 --> 02:17:01.623]  I am fired up about freedom and I'm angry about what's happening.
[02:17:02.472 --> 02:17:03.653]  And call me if I'm wrong.
[02:17:03.673 --> 02:17:04.414]  You think I'm wrong.
[02:17:04.454 --> 02:17:08.838]  You think cameras that videotape us naked at the airport and store, that's good.
[02:17:08.858 --> 02:17:14.103]  If you think police holding you down on the side of the road taking blood samples is good.
[02:17:14.764 --> 02:17:16.866]  If you think the Fourth Amendment being thrown out is good.
[02:17:16.926 --> 02:17:18.688]  If you think the Fifth Amendment being thrown out is good.
[02:17:19.228 --> 02:17:20.189]  Let me know why.
[02:17:20.269 --> 02:17:21.651]  You're a neocon.
[02:17:21.671 --> 02:17:23.232]  You think gun control is conservative.
[02:17:23.833 --> 02:17:24.033]  Let.
[02:17:24.393 --> 02:17:24.634]  Me.
[02:17:24.994 --> 02:17:25.274]  Know.
[02:17:25.635 --> 02:17:25.915]  Why.
[02:17:27.398 --> 02:17:27.838]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:27.858 --> 02:17:30.180]  Sharon, Colorado.
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:32.782]  Go ahead.
[02:17:32.802 --> 02:17:35.264]  Hello, Alex.
[02:17:35.364 --> 02:17:35.724]  Hello.
[02:17:36.605 --> 02:17:57.281]  I was just wondering, the way that you could get the middle class all together in the same, um, let's just say company, all together doing the same thing, in order to wipe them all out financially and everything, there's a way that you can do it.
[02:17:57.836 --> 02:18:08.762]  If you have the largest company in the world that has assets of one trillion dollars, which still doesn't, it doesn't make more than the Rothschilds, I'm sure.
[02:18:08.782 --> 02:18:10.523]  Okay, explain what you're saying.
[02:18:11.063 --> 02:18:25.711]  Okay, what you do is you get a financial company and then you have maybe six or seven subsidiaries that all deal in all different sorts of things, life insurance,
[02:18:26.506 --> 02:18:28.869]  Um, stocks and bonds, all of this stuff.
[02:18:28.989 --> 02:18:34.514]  So, so, so, brand things is made in America, we're the freedom company, spend with us.
[02:18:35.055 --> 02:18:42.402]  The problem is the globalists control the infrastructure and will with provocateurs and selective harassment by the IRS would shut that down.
[02:18:42.842 --> 02:19:00.108]  Instead, you support freedom groups, large and small, across the board, and you start boycotting the establishment companies, and, like we destroyed Kmart when Rosie O'Donnell wanted a gun grab, or how we destroyed Smith & Wesson when they wanted a gun grab, we do have that power, but it's part of a Liberty Bill of Rights culture.
[02:19:00.388 --> 02:19:01.708]  Good to hear from you, good points.
[02:19:03.089 --> 02:19:09.111]  But you can't have one president save you, or one company save you, but it's a great idea, and that's a process.
[02:19:09.733 --> 02:19:15.136]  And it takes successful people in the middle class or wealthy people to get involved and say no.
[02:19:15.176 --> 02:19:21.238]  It also takes the working class, you know, just the blue collar people to spread the word and educate their friends and family.
[02:19:21.579 --> 02:19:24.580]  Defeating the New World Order starts with spending time with your children.
[02:19:25.320 --> 02:19:26.741]  Starts with loving your family.
[02:19:27.201 --> 02:19:28.682]  Starts with learning the Bill of Rights.
[02:19:29.241 --> 02:19:31.944]  It starts with not fighting with your husband and wife.
[02:19:32.425 --> 02:19:33.986]  It starts with having love.
[02:19:34.287 --> 02:19:37.150]  It starts with recognizing the nightly news as propaganda.
[02:19:37.410 --> 02:19:42.737]  It starts with shifting your paradigm, breaking your conditioning, and unlocking your minds!
[02:19:46.363 --> 02:19:47.883]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:19:48.043 --> 02:19:49.184]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:19:49.364 --> 02:19:52.764]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:19:52.884 --> 02:19:53.324]  Phenol?
[02:19:53.624 --> 02:20:00.725]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:20:01.046 --> 02:20:05.146]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies, such as asthma.
[02:20:05.266 --> 02:20:05.706]  Fragrance?
[02:20:06.086 --> 02:20:10.847]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:10.967 --> 02:20:15.568]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:20:15.888 --> 02:20:18.430]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[02:20:18.690 --> 02:20:22.112]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:20:22.252 --> 02:20:25.815]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:20:26.015 --> 02:20:28.376]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:20:28.537 --> 02:20:29.417]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:20:29.517 --> 02:20:39.264]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:20:46.929 --> 02:20:50.071]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[02:20:50.512 --> 02:20:52.533]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[02:20:52.893 --> 02:20:55.475]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[02:20:55.835 --> 02:21:00.399]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[02:21:00.599 --> 02:21:02.400]  But you have to act now!
[02:21:02.580 --> 02:21:08.705]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[02:21:09.145 --> 02:21:15.668]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[02:21:15.908 --> 02:21:19.470]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[02:21:19.690 --> 02:21:23.152]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[02:21:23.572 --> 02:21:25.853]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[02:21:26.213 --> 02:21:27.054]  Do it now.
[02:21:27.294 --> 02:21:29.495]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[02:21:29.895 --> 02:21:36.658]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[02:21:38.004 --> 02:21:38.866]  That's Midas at 800-686-2237.
[02:21:45.968 --> 02:21:54.590]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:21:54.810 --> 02:22:06.092]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:22:06.292 --> 02:22:08.933]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:22:09.293 --> 02:22:15.755]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:22:15.915 --> 02:22:17.776]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:22:17.976 --> 02:22:23.998]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:22:24.258 --> 02:22:29.920]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:34.185]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:22:34.205 --> 02:22:34.905]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:22:34.925 --> 02:22:35.626]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:22:46.966 --> 02:22:49.028]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:22:49.208 --> 02:22:50.850]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[02:22:50.970 --> 02:22:58.957]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:22:59.218 --> 02:23:05.644]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:23:05.824 --> 02:23:07.065]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:23:07.225 --> 02:23:07.465]  I think so.
[02:23:23.422 --> 02:23:27.305]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[02:23:27.545 --> 02:23:28.425]  No fires allowed?
[02:23:28.546 --> 02:23:29.566]  Hot meals still are?
[02:23:29.686 --> 02:23:33.729]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll free at 800-601-2833.

[02:23:43.156 --> 02:23:44.817]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today!
[02:23:48.903 --> 02:23:54.924]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:55.544 --> 02:23:58.525]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:01.486 --> 02:24:02.946]  Let's blitz through your calls.
[02:24:03.466 --> 02:24:05.126]  Carol in Idaho, go ahead.
[02:24:05.146 --> 02:24:07.187]  Hi Alex, thank you.
[02:24:07.207 --> 02:24:11.948]  I admire beyond words what leaders like you are doing, and that includes Aaron Russo.
[02:24:12.348 --> 02:24:17.009]  I just didn't call soon enough to talk with him, but I want to mention about the
[02:24:18.331 --> 02:24:25.638]  Wisdom or the effectiveness of us true Americans at this point in our nation's history running for the White House.
[02:24:26.338 --> 02:24:29.601]  And I wonder, how serious are we about winning?
[02:24:29.922 --> 02:24:42.913]  Now, we all know from history that the third party candidate, especially if it's a true American freedom fighter, he has all he can do to even get mentioned on the scoreboard when it comes to presidential elections.
[02:24:43.294 --> 02:24:43.674]  However,
[02:24:44.489 --> 02:25:01.012]  If we were to band together, that is, the Constitution Party, the Libertarian Party, if all of those guys that want to run for president were serious, it seems to me they would call a convention among themselves and choose one candidate.
[02:25:01.272 --> 02:25:03.993]  And then I would get excited, I'd dig to the bottom.
[02:25:04.013 --> 02:25:06.353]  I'm telling you it's a good idea, and that's your 60 seconds.
[02:25:06.393 --> 02:25:06.933]  Great point.
[02:25:07.653 --> 02:25:08.974]  Rick in New York, go ahead.
[02:25:10.314 --> 02:25:10.474]  Hello?
[02:25:11.198 --> 02:25:11.458]  Yes.
[02:25:11.858 --> 02:25:28.964]  I'm just listening to the O'Franken Factor while listening to your show, of course, and Bob Kerrey was on, and a caller called up and asked if they had investigated the report that Ashcroft had stopped flying in July, and that San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown was alerted by Condoleezza.
[02:25:29.524 --> 02:25:30.725]  He dismissed it out of hand.
[02:25:30.765 --> 02:25:32.446]  He said there was no evidence for that.
[02:25:32.606 --> 02:25:33.006]  Oh, really?
[02:25:33.046 --> 02:25:36.687]  CBS News and the White House admits it, and the San Francisco Chronicle?
[02:25:37.147 --> 02:25:39.288]  To me, that's proof that this is really just a whitewash.
[02:25:41.167 --> 02:25:48.951]  Well, that's the problem with the so-called liberal alternative press, is that it's the same system and they don't hit any of the real meat and potatoes issues.
[02:25:49.111 --> 02:25:53.613]  Exactly, and then Franken went on to say that, oh, he doesn't believe in any of these conspiracy theories.
[02:25:53.653 --> 02:25:56.654]  Well, that's not a conspiracy theory, it's a mainstream news article.
[02:25:56.714 --> 02:26:06.258]  The one about Ashcroft is CBS News, and that's July 26th, and the September 11th San Francisco Chronicle, it is admitted.
[02:26:06.298 --> 02:26:06.919]  Thank you for the call.
[02:26:07.799 --> 02:26:09.220]  Let's talk to Scott in Rhode Island.
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:09.880]  Scott, go ahead.
[02:26:10.632 --> 02:26:12.133]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:26:12.173 --> 02:26:14.275]  I just want to say thank you for enlightening me.
[02:26:14.335 --> 02:26:17.859]  I've been spreading the word, watching your movies, and listening to your show.
[02:26:18.299 --> 02:26:20.721]  Um, did you mention that something happened in Providence recently?
[02:26:20.761 --> 02:26:22.883]  They tried to declare martial law.
[02:26:23.083 --> 02:26:25.926]  Yeah, that's on News 9 and Providence Journal.
[02:26:27.107 --> 02:26:28.068]  Okay, I'll look that up.
[02:26:28.168 --> 02:26:34.394]  Also, I was wondering if, uh, do you, uh, do you worry much about being taken out by the feds?
[02:26:34.974 --> 02:26:35.955]  And honestly, like,
[02:26:36.539 --> 02:26:45.624]  Like, are you afraid that maybe one of these nights you're going to get in some freaky car accident, or a sniper or someone is going to take you out for what you've been paying?
[02:26:46.464 --> 02:26:55.328]  Well, to answer that, and it's a question I get every day on these talk show interviews I do, there are tens of thousands of us that are prominent, and there are millions of us fighting.
[02:26:55.369 --> 02:27:03.473]  My family's worth dying if the globals want to kill me, and that's God's will it'll happen, but they'll just make me a martyr, a prophet, whatever.
[02:27:03.493 --> 02:27:04.613]  I don't think they want to do that.
[02:27:05.494 --> 02:27:05.954]  Also,
[02:27:07.549 --> 02:27:12.370]  The number one cause of death until I hit 55 will be automobile accidents, but we all still get in our cars.
[02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:14.371]  And that's the most dangerous thing we do.
[02:27:14.391 --> 02:27:25.833]  You just gotta accept the risk, they're worth it, and the cost-benefit analysis, the price is far too high, and I just let the fear go through me and over me, and I'm not worried about it, because I love this country and I love my family.
[02:27:25.873 --> 02:27:26.453]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:26.853 --> 02:27:28.614]  Now let's talk to James in Kansas City.
[02:27:28.634 --> 02:27:29.294]  Go ahead, James.
[02:27:30.472 --> 02:27:34.254]  First off, I want to say you're a leader, and we need to take it to the next level.
[02:27:34.294 --> 02:27:41.758]  You should have flyers designed for your website that people could easily hand out, and it will quote the news sources of the very things you're talking about.
[02:27:42.059 --> 02:27:47.302]  And I also believe that, yeah, we do need a third-party primary where they throw all their resources behind one candidate.
[02:27:47.322 --> 02:27:49.883]  Hey, I'll tell you what, everybody keeps asking for this, and I never get around to it.
[02:27:50.303 --> 02:27:55.146]  Listeners, make flyers for the website that promote the radio show, that promote the websites,
[02:27:55.926 --> 02:28:03.552]  And send them to tipsandinfowars.com and I'll take some of the best and I'll post them in PDF downloadable format.
[02:28:03.812 --> 02:28:04.653]  Please do it.
[02:28:04.793 --> 02:28:08.456]  All you great people with all your talents, you want to help, that's how you can help.
[02:28:09.777 --> 02:28:10.117]  Thank you.
[02:28:10.297 --> 02:28:11.318]  Go ahead, anything else?
[02:28:11.939 --> 02:28:12.479]  No, sir.
[02:28:12.999 --> 02:28:13.340]  Thank you.
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:14.380]  Good to hear from you.
[02:28:15.181 --> 02:28:16.322]  Joe in Illinois.
[02:28:16.402 --> 02:28:17.143]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:28:17.383 --> 02:28:18.263]  Hey, how's it going?
[02:28:18.624 --> 02:28:18.884]  Good.
[02:28:19.384 --> 02:28:22.206]  Yeah, I just wanted to thank you for everything that you're doing here.
[02:28:23.345 --> 02:28:24.566]  It was just really weird.
[02:28:24.666 --> 02:28:30.328]  Yesterday morning I was at the bus stop and I never, ever, ever pick up a newspaper or buy a newspaper.
[02:28:30.348 --> 02:28:34.630]  I don't know, I was just totally compelled to just grab one.
[02:28:35.390 --> 02:28:41.093]  As I'm reading through it, there was a guy that was pinched for child pornography.
[02:28:41.553 --> 02:28:43.054]  As I read down here in the article,
[02:28:43.934 --> 02:28:46.095]  It says, uh, you know, about the images.
[02:28:46.115 --> 02:28:46.935]  School principal.
[02:28:47.435 --> 02:28:47.935]  Exactly.
[02:28:48.355 --> 02:28:49.915]  Are you the guy that faxed that story to me?
[02:28:50.055 --> 02:28:50.396]  Yes, sir.
[02:28:50.696 --> 02:28:54.557]  Yeah, I got that, and I have stacks of those every week, and he wasn't even going to cover it.
[02:28:55.197 --> 02:29:01.318]  And again, a janitor puts cameras in the bathroom, he goes to jail, the schools do it officially, it's federally funded.
[02:29:01.678 --> 02:29:09.160]  So, this principal should go to jail, but how does he go to jail, and the janitor go to jail, when the government's doing it officially, and it's good?
[02:29:09.853 --> 02:29:13.594]  Right, did you actually see who actually filed the affidavit?
[02:29:13.994 --> 02:29:15.015]  I scanned the article, though.
[02:29:15.035 --> 02:29:15.355]  Tell us.
[02:29:15.595 --> 02:29:18.536]  It was Homeland Security Department, Immigration and Customs.
[02:29:18.556 --> 02:29:22.297]  So they were involved scanning this principal?
[02:29:22.697 --> 02:29:23.177]  I guess so.
[02:29:23.657 --> 02:29:29.199]  Wow, that's scary, because it's obviously not terrorism related, but again, they're going to be involved in everything, they already are.
[02:29:29.659 --> 02:29:31.900]  Alright, but see, they're keeping you safe from the bad people.
[02:29:32.220 --> 02:29:32.780]  We'll be back.
[02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:33.321]  Stay with us.
[02:29:33.381 --> 02:29:34.621]  More your calls, more news.
[02:29:36.781 --> 02:29:39.786]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:29:59.539 --> 02:30:04.061]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:30:04.121 --> 02:30:15.465]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:30:16.045 --> 02:30:22.891]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:30:23.291 --> 02:30:25.433]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:30:25.934 --> 02:30:30.898]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:33:45.603 --> 02:33:50.605]  Folks, one of my new films, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, is two hours, forty-four minutes long.
[02:33:50.645 --> 02:33:52.365]  It's really three or four films in one.
[02:33:52.886 --> 02:34:00.628]  The first twenty-five minutes gives you a picture of what the New World Order is, its history, who the neocons are, the false left-right political paradigm.
[02:34:01.068 --> 02:34:02.449]  That's the first twenty-five minutes.

[02:34:27.842 --> 02:34:28.602]  How to stop them.
[02:34:28.902 --> 02:34:40.244]  Matrix of Evil is a compilation of speeches of Ron Paul and Cynthia McKinney and Colonel Roberts and Frank Morales and myself and video and news clips and documents and the latest info and full of solutions.

[02:36:00.030 --> 02:36:01.470]  Let's talk to Vince in Illinois.
[02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:02.291]  Vince, go ahead.
[02:36:02.451 --> 02:36:06.193]  Yeah, Alex, the program that you had Colonel Don DeGraham pre-on?
[02:36:06.694 --> 02:36:06.974]  Yes.
[02:36:07.394 --> 02:36:10.396]  That was one of the most provocative shows I've ever heard on your radio program.
[02:36:10.776 --> 02:36:21.143]  And I really would like to think that there are good people in our military that are ready to overthrow this cabal if and when we have another terror strike or they really try to put the shackles on us here.
[02:36:21.924 --> 02:36:23.845]  My question to you is, how are the
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:40.230]  Average American people gotta know, if we ever come to that point, where there is some sort of a military counter-coup, how will we know that these are good people in our military, or if these aren't just the minions of these people bringing us the fascist military government that they probably just want?
[02:36:40.511 --> 02:36:42.992]  Well, that's what I brought forward with Colonel Don DeGrampre.
[02:36:43.012 --> 02:36:43.613]  Thanks for the call.
[02:36:43.653 --> 02:36:45.454]  Let me try to answer it quickly and go back to calls.
[02:36:46.809 --> 02:36:47.970]  Very complex issue, though.
[02:36:48.451 --> 02:36:49.932]  I do not support a military coup.
[02:36:50.052 --> 02:36:57.039]  I wish no harm upon Bill Clinton, upon George W. Bush, upon George Herbert Walker Bush, upon any of these minions.
[02:36:57.079 --> 02:36:58.220]  They're mid-level minions.
[02:36:58.521 --> 02:37:03.986]  It's the corrupt architecture of the New World Order that has to be dismantled, removed.
[02:37:04.166 --> 02:37:05.648]  We have to get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[02:37:06.593 --> 02:37:11.194]  Colonel Don DeGrand Prix is saying from his sources, this has been discussed, this has been going on.
[02:37:11.794 --> 02:37:17.455]  There's a lot of evidence that Clinton had a bunch of military officers assassinated in the early 90's who were planning something like this.
[02:37:17.855 --> 02:37:24.537]  And yes, a military coup is very dangerous because they could just set themselves up in power as we saw in the latter Roman Empire.
[02:37:25.337 --> 02:37:35.619]  But it is a good thing if the military doesn't follow orders to force-inoculate, to confiscate guns, and that's where we need to do the agitating, is with the low-level rank-and-file foot soldiers.
[02:37:36.660 --> 02:37:39.382]  Let's go ahead and talk to Aaron in Florida.
[02:37:39.502 --> 02:37:40.263]  Aaron, go ahead.
[02:37:40.723 --> 02:37:41.784]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:37:42.085 --> 02:37:42.425]  Hello.
[02:37:42.765 --> 02:37:51.772]  Yeah, get your movie there, or rather your information pack, basically, on the total enslavement.
[02:37:52.713 --> 02:37:56.096]  We sat down and watched it, a few of us hams, since I'm a ham radio operator.
[02:37:57.537 --> 02:38:02.621]  We sat down because we are very patriotic and we care about our country and our fellow people.
[02:38:03.672 --> 02:38:07.655]  And it's a lot of information to hit you all at one time.
[02:38:07.715 --> 02:38:11.078]  It's a lot to sit down to, and it's pretty shocking.
[02:38:11.418 --> 02:38:13.359]  But people need to realize what's going on.
[02:38:13.740 --> 02:38:16.862]  What did you get from watching the two-hour, 44-minute video?
[02:38:18.903 --> 02:38:23.047]  Well, there was a fear factor at first, the overwhelming of information.
[02:38:23.107 --> 02:38:26.950]  But you had a caller earlier today, which I totally agree with.
[02:38:27.090 --> 02:38:31.213]  The editing of your information perhaps might need
[02:38:32.017 --> 02:38:45.208]  Just a tad of the basic facts of what other people like firemen and police and things of that nature, which I've heard you speak to before, because that speaks volumes.
[02:38:45.388 --> 02:38:56.037]  Ordinary people like ourselves who are in the front run of this, and thank God people like yourselves are out there doing this.
[02:38:56.077 --> 02:38:59.900]  My question would be, I wonder how Jesse Ventura and
[02:39:00.433 --> 02:39:05.017]  Individuals like that whom I seem to respect now, but I don't know personally.
[02:39:06.558 --> 02:39:12.523]  And then the gentleman that you had on earlier, Aaron, which I thought was fairly informative too.
[02:39:14.504 --> 02:39:23.952]  What kind of promotion or as far as education, as far as commercial type things have you considered as far as
[02:39:24.758 --> 02:39:30.884]  You know, all of us chipping in and actually getting some actual commercial around news.
[02:39:30.965 --> 02:39:33.667]  I've got to let you go because I'm going to the calls quickly.
[02:39:35.049 --> 02:39:37.892]  Look, we're not going to fix things with one person or one movement.
[02:39:38.232 --> 02:39:40.815]  It's everybody getting involved, everybody taking action.
[02:39:41.670 --> 02:39:47.234]  And certainly my films could not be as lengthy or well-documented, but I'm trying to get to the thinkers out there.
[02:39:47.254 --> 02:39:48.515]  You know, you watched it.
[02:39:48.676 --> 02:39:49.416]  It woke you up.
[02:39:49.496 --> 02:39:50.297]  It informed you.
[02:39:50.577 --> 02:39:52.479]  You're worried others won't be able to absorb it.
[02:39:52.999 --> 02:39:54.960]  The people we need will be able to absorb it.
[02:39:55.841 --> 02:39:59.944]  The cattle out there, as the globalists call them, the dumbed-down mass, isn't going to be able to.
[02:40:00.004 --> 02:40:03.227]  They can't figure anything out past Jennifer Aniston and the football game.
[02:40:04.169 --> 02:40:08.733]  So, I believe in waking up people, you know, that want to be woken up.
[02:40:09.113 --> 02:40:11.575]  And I don't see the poor sheeple as cattle.
[02:40:11.615 --> 02:40:12.516]  I do see them as sheep.
[02:40:13.077 --> 02:40:14.338]  And we need to try to wake them up.
[02:40:15.699 --> 02:40:17.480]  So let's go ahead and go to Mike in Colorado.
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:18.121]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:40:19.081 --> 02:40:20.703]  Yeah, Alex, I'm a first-time caller.
[02:40:20.723 --> 02:40:24.466]  I've got a lot of stuff to say to you, but I know we don't have time for that.
[02:40:24.806 --> 02:40:25.507]  Quick question.
[02:40:25.547 --> 02:40:27.848]  What can I do to wake people up?
[02:40:28.369 --> 02:40:32.152]  You know, everybody's out there doing stuff, ex-military.
[02:40:33.042 --> 02:40:34.524]  They all call me anti-government.
[02:40:34.624 --> 02:40:37.066]  I try to explain to them, not anti-government.
[02:40:37.126 --> 02:40:47.133]  I see callers call in, some say everybody wakes up, some say most people wake up, and then I get a call from you saying, and I get some of these, that nobody wants to watch it.
[02:40:47.173 --> 02:40:55.420]  They must be really stupid when they're there watching the globalists call for world government, and the globalists admit all this, and their own mainstream media admitting it.
[02:40:55.740 --> 02:41:00.843]  And then they're saying it's anti-government to criticize the government, when that's what we were supposed to do as Americans?
[02:41:01.183 --> 02:41:06.566]  They're the ones that are un-American, that don't know our Bill of Rights, and I'd say move on, because they like being cattle!
[02:41:07.607 --> 02:41:08.107]  Exactly.
[02:41:08.127 --> 02:41:10.549]  You know, my buddy's in the Marine Corps in West Virginia.
[02:41:10.569 --> 02:41:11.269]  That's where I'm from.
[02:41:11.329 --> 02:41:14.251]  I try to... Every year I go down there and hunt, and I take videos.
[02:41:14.871 --> 02:41:16.832]  And every year I get the same response.
[02:41:17.513 --> 02:41:22.616]  You know, and... Do they watch them, or do they just say, I'm not going to watch it, that's anti-government?
[02:41:23.336 --> 02:41:24.937]  Oh, I make them sit down and watch it with me.
[02:41:26.175 --> 02:41:28.036]  And they say that's anti-government.
[02:41:28.736 --> 02:41:28.936]  Yup.
[02:41:29.776 --> 02:41:35.198]  So they think being an American is not asking questions, giving up your Bill of Rights, being a slave.
[02:41:36.138 --> 02:41:36.658]  Exactly.
[02:41:36.878 --> 02:41:39.299]  You need to get some other friends.
[02:41:39.579 --> 02:41:41.579]  Don't waste another second on those people.
[02:41:42.620 --> 02:41:45.460]  Yeah, I'm definitely ready to give up on them.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:49.382]  Most of the Marines I've talked to and the troops I've talked to are awake and are concerned.
[02:41:49.822 --> 02:41:50.742]  You must have bad luck.
[02:41:51.826 --> 02:41:58.408]  Yeah, well, they were young when they went in the military, and they're brainwashing people so, so fast.
[02:41:59.268 --> 02:42:01.869]  Well, I mean, ask them why they're huffing, depleting uranium.
[02:42:01.889 --> 02:42:04.030]  The Pentagon's own doctor quit and said it was deadly.
[02:42:04.050 --> 02:42:05.670]  Why are they giving them deadly vaccines?
[02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:06.190]  That's admitted.
[02:42:06.210 --> 02:42:07.851]  I mean, we care about the troops.
[02:42:08.551 --> 02:42:10.712]  And this is wrong, what's happening.
[02:42:10.732 --> 02:42:11.872]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:12.692 --> 02:42:13.513]  Mike in Florida.
[02:42:13.553 --> 02:42:14.213]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:42:15.613 --> 02:42:16.154]  Hey, Alex.
[02:42:17.294 --> 02:42:17.554]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:18.109 --> 02:42:21.472]  Hey, James from Florida here.
[02:42:21.512 --> 02:42:22.953]  I've got a couple of things to say, though.
[02:42:23.173 --> 02:42:24.654]  I really appreciate your effort.
[02:42:24.834 --> 02:42:29.598]  I heard about you on the coast the other night with George Norrie, I guess a couple of weeks ago.
[02:42:29.818 --> 02:42:31.539]  Yeah, email him and tell him to have me back on.
[02:42:32.260 --> 02:42:34.241]  Oh yeah, hey man, I mean, thank God, you know?
[02:42:34.361 --> 02:42:39.105]  I mean, honest to God, I've been researching all this stuff for like nine months ago.
[02:42:39.125 --> 02:42:40.466]  I just sort of woke up one day.
[02:42:41.061 --> 02:42:43.003]  And when I heard you talking, it was just amazing.
[02:42:43.043 --> 02:42:44.824]  Now, two things I really appreciated.
[02:42:44.844 --> 02:42:56.353]  I appreciated that Don, the Grand Prix, what we talked about, what the last caller talked about, and I also appreciate the 9-11 video that you put online, because to me it's more accessible, it's more readily accessible to our ADD culture.
[02:42:56.693 --> 02:43:00.176]  Yeah, we put it out for free, and then I pay so you can watch it.
[02:43:00.376 --> 02:43:07.961]  And then again, we take the little bit of money we get from selling the videos, and use that to pay for the four servers we've got going now.
[02:43:08.502 --> 02:43:09.863]  Thank God, because now,
[02:43:10.495 --> 02:43:11.296]  People can see this.
[02:43:11.376 --> 02:43:16.420]  Now, I think the toughest people to reach, of course, are the neoconservative people.
[02:43:16.460 --> 02:43:24.027]  Like, I get on one of the MSN boards and say... Yeah, they think gun control, open borders, big government is conservative.
[02:43:24.047 --> 02:43:24.548]  They're idiots!
[02:43:24.968 --> 02:43:31.874]  Well, the pro-American, pro-conservative, it's a web forum on there, and I like to get on there and talk.
[02:43:32.034 --> 02:43:36.699]  And they always, they call me a liberal all the time, like it's the worst word to ever call anybody.
[02:43:37.483 --> 02:43:44.509]  I always kind of start everything with, like, using the quote that dissent is the highest form of patriotism, that Thomas Jefferson quote, you know?
[02:43:46.030 --> 02:43:47.751]  They're the sports fans mentality.
[02:43:48.031 --> 02:43:50.353]  They think cheering for Bush gives them power.
[02:43:50.613 --> 02:43:52.375]  Just like Democrats, I'd warn them about Clinton.
[02:43:52.395 --> 02:43:54.857]  They'd go, oh, but I associate my power with them.
[02:43:54.917 --> 02:43:55.617]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:55.877 --> 02:43:56.718]  Good to hear from you.
[02:43:56.998 --> 02:43:57.979]  Annabelle in Texas.
[02:43:58.019 --> 02:43:58.920]  Annabelle, go ahead.
[02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:01.622]  Hi, I'm calling from Austin, Texas.
[02:44:02.022 --> 02:44:02.382]  Welcome.
[02:44:02.883 --> 02:44:03.363]  Thank you.
[02:44:04.424 --> 02:44:05.104]  Three things.
[02:44:06.539 --> 02:44:14.067]  We saw a few days after 9-11 on the news a video clip that a lady had taken.
[02:44:14.087 --> 02:44:19.012]  It looked like it was from maybe the third, fourth, fifth story of her apartment building.
[02:44:19.492 --> 02:44:29.062]  She had noticed three or four men on top of their van setting up a tripod with a video camera aimed at the towers.
[02:44:30.934 --> 02:44:37.567]  And my husband and I both saw this and we've been waiting and waiting for somebody to say something because it was on the news.
[02:44:37.707 --> 02:44:39.871]  I don't remember what news station it was on.
[02:44:42.335 --> 02:44:49.660]  The lady, when the Twin Towers exploded, you couldn't see the towers, but you heard the noise, and everything shook.
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:51.841]  So, it seemed very authentic.
[02:44:52.261 --> 02:44:53.122]  Okay, okay, ma'am.
[02:44:53.182 --> 02:44:56.464]  Ma'am, we have MSNBC, we have AP, we have New York Daily News.
[02:44:56.824 --> 02:44:57.985]  It is not an urban legend.
[02:44:58.525 --> 02:45:02.808]  A bunch of Israelis were arrested with video cameras on top of buildings videotaping it.
[02:45:03.388 --> 02:45:04.028]  Why is that not?
[02:45:04.048 --> 02:45:04.689]  Let me finish.
[02:45:04.809 --> 02:45:05.349]  Let me finish.
[02:45:05.870 --> 02:45:06.550]  Let me just finish.
[02:45:06.830 --> 02:45:07.170]  Sure.
[02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.991]  Since you brought this up.
[02:45:09.170 --> 02:45:15.998]  And then when they went back to the moving company, it had been owned by a known Mossad officer, everything had been pulled out and taken away.
[02:45:16.538 --> 02:45:16.919]  Exactly.
[02:45:16.999 --> 02:45:18.360]  And so that's it then?
[02:45:18.420 --> 02:45:19.922]  And then nobody's supposed to talk about that?
[02:45:20.423 --> 02:45:26.890]  Yeah, and they actually followed up and said that they were Massoud agents and that they had been deported.
[02:45:27.952 --> 02:45:29.833]  And we saw the film.
[02:45:29.993 --> 02:45:31.673]  My husband and I saw the film.
[02:45:31.713 --> 02:45:36.394]  They were jumping up and down and high-fiving and everything when the towers went off.
[02:45:36.414 --> 02:45:38.594]  Now, I've never seen the film of them jumping up and down.
[02:45:38.614 --> 02:45:39.855]  I know they were arrested for it.
[02:45:40.275 --> 02:45:41.355]  Yeah, and then we saw it.
[02:45:41.495 --> 02:45:42.415]  We actually saw it.
[02:45:42.435 --> 02:45:43.095]  Where did you see this?
[02:45:43.675 --> 02:45:46.656]  On our local news, or it might have been PBS.
[02:45:47.176 --> 02:45:48.296]  We don't remember, you know.
[02:45:48.336 --> 02:45:50.597]  We thought it was... Hey, gotta let you go.
[02:45:50.677 --> 02:45:52.377]  If somebody's got that, please send it to us.
[02:45:53.337 --> 02:45:55.158]  Let's talk to Blake in Tennessee.
[02:45:55.198 --> 02:45:55.838]  Blake, go ahead.
[02:45:56.820 --> 02:45:57.381]  Hello, Alex?
[02:45:57.601 --> 02:45:57.901]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:58.302 --> 02:45:59.703]  Hey, thanks for taking my call.
[02:46:00.304 --> 02:46:15.200]  Listen, Alex, on the police state that we're coming up against now, the New World Order and the control that you're going to take over, I know people are waking up and I know their secrets are being revealed, but what's to say that they're not going to back down and slow down?
[02:46:15.905 --> 02:46:20.408]  What's to say that they're not going to speed it up and escalate it even more than what they've been doing?
[02:46:20.428 --> 02:46:31.496]  I think they have escalated the brainwashing, the police state, but big terror attacks, the globalists were already planning more, but now they've had to back off because they're getting caught in it, and it's backfiring on them.
[02:46:32.116 --> 02:46:35.539]  But no, believe me, their program is behind schedule, and we're having a big effect.
[02:46:36.299 --> 02:46:39.421]  Well, we need to, and I just need to say amen.
[02:46:40.062 --> 02:46:44.245]  Alex, and also one thing, with all the interest rates across this nation,
[02:46:44.881 --> 02:46:49.903]  That they've gone down and stayed down in record numbers.
[02:46:49.943 --> 02:46:51.603]  Foreign countries that dump our bonds.
[02:46:52.003 --> 02:46:54.064]  All of this is designed to drive down the economy.
[02:46:54.304 --> 02:47:04.988]  Well what's to say that with everybody remortgaging, refinancing, borrowing money on these low rates, that from the top down that they don't start saying,
[02:47:05.367 --> 02:47:06.087]  It's payback.
[02:47:06.428 --> 02:47:08.149]  Payback now, or we own it.
[02:47:08.529 --> 02:47:10.830]  And the whole country can be owned by one group.
[02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:11.531]  Exactly.
[02:47:11.551 --> 02:47:13.252]  They're setting this scam up across the board.
[02:47:13.312 --> 02:47:13.952]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:13.972 --> 02:47:17.514]  I'm going to cover a few news stories, and we'll take four or five more calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:47:17.614 --> 02:47:21.956]  NatinOrg, and you're up next.
[02:47:22.737 --> 02:47:24.558]  But first, this is Senate Bill 742.
[02:47:24.898 --> 02:47:32.322]  And it says, creates crime of terrorism, punishes by life in prison.
[02:47:32.422 --> 02:47:33.363]  That's the headline of the bill.
[02:47:34.205 --> 02:47:39.587]  A bill for an act relating to terrorism creating new provisions and amending section 19 chapter 666.
[02:47:41.348 --> 02:47:41.608]  Yep.
[02:47:42.128 --> 02:47:43.468]  Ornigan Laws 2001.
[02:47:44.929 --> 02:47:48.710]  So this is a 2003 law they tried to pass amending 2001 laws.
[02:47:48.810 --> 02:47:49.171]  Section 1.
[02:47:49.391 --> 02:48:00.535]  A person commits the crime of terrorism if the person knowingly plans, participates, and or carries out any act that is identified by at least one of its participants to disrupt.
[02:48:00.915 --> 02:48:03.676]  So if one participant in a whole protest
[02:48:04.261 --> 02:48:05.943]  Does any of this life in prison?
[02:48:07.984 --> 02:48:16.812]  Now, Section A. If the person disrupts, or if one participant disrupts, the free and orderly assembly of the inhabitants of the state of Oregon.
[02:48:17.252 --> 02:48:21.276]  You block any door, any cars, anything, life in prison.
[02:48:21.676 --> 02:48:25.539]  B. Commerce of the transportation system of the state of Oregon.
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:28.101]  Step in front of a police car, life in prison.
[02:48:28.121 --> 02:48:28.762]  It actually says this.
[02:48:29.997 --> 02:48:34.880]  C. The educational or governmental institutions of the state of Oregon or its inhabitants.
[02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:34.880]  2.
[02:48:37.361 --> 02:48:44.985]  A person commits the crime of terrorism if that person conspires to do any of the activities described in subsection 1 of this section.
[02:48:46.098 --> 02:48:50.959]  And it says, Part 4A, a person convicted of terrorism shall be punished by imprisonment for life.
[02:48:51.139 --> 02:49:05.482]  B, when a person is convicted of terrorism under this section, the court shall order that the person be confined for a minimum of 25 years without possibility of parole, and only to be released on work release to a forest or work camp.
[02:49:05.602 --> 02:49:08.523]  So, you get 25 years if you agree to the forest work camp.
[02:49:10.439 --> 02:49:36.051]  and uh... so there you go and then they give the things that you can get life in prison for not just blocking traffic and some of the stuff's bad some of it's stuff that's not so they mix some real crimes in with things that aren't crimes uh... bribes giving as defined in section 106.015 of penal code of Oregon bribe receiving and it gives that public investment fraud bribing a witness
[02:49:36.826 --> 02:49:38.207]  Where I'm receiving by a witness.
[02:49:38.427 --> 02:49:39.908]  Simulating legal process.
[02:49:40.428 --> 02:49:41.649]  So acting like you're a lawyer.
[02:49:42.389 --> 02:49:44.150]  Official misconduct in the first degree.
[02:49:44.590 --> 02:49:46.571]  Custodial interference in the second degree.
[02:49:47.592 --> 02:49:49.493]  Custodial interference in the first degree.
[02:49:50.333 --> 02:49:53.175]  Buying or selling a person under 18 years of age as defined.
[02:49:53.195 --> 02:49:54.816]  So they put a few things that are really bad in there.
[02:49:55.376 --> 02:49:56.177]  And blocking traffic.
[02:49:56.757 --> 02:49:59.078]  Using a child in display of sexually explicit conduct.
[02:49:59.799 --> 02:50:01.880]  Encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree.
[02:50:02.640 --> 02:50:03.921]  And then it gives some more of those.
[02:50:04.771 --> 02:50:09.094]  Possessing of materials depicting sexually explicit, you know, same stuff.
[02:50:09.675 --> 02:50:12.116]  And then it says, uh, theft in the second degree.
[02:50:12.677 --> 02:50:13.797]  Theft in the first degree.
[02:50:14.818 --> 02:50:16.319]  Aggravated theft in the first degree.
[02:50:16.519 --> 02:50:17.620]  Theft by extortion.
[02:50:17.680 --> 02:50:18.701]  Theft by deception.
[02:50:19.681 --> 02:50:21.363]  Theft by receiving as defined.
[02:50:21.383 --> 02:50:24.385]  And then they've got mail or receipt of stolen mail.
[02:50:25.045 --> 02:50:26.466]  Unauthorized use of vehicle.
[02:50:26.686 --> 02:50:27.167]  Ha ha!
[02:50:28.167 --> 02:50:32.050]  You know, I've had friends got tickets for that for mud in their trucks.
[02:50:32.879 --> 02:50:37.908]  Uh, engaging in financial transactions in property derived from unlawful activity.
[02:50:38.308 --> 02:50:39.530]  Burglary in the second degree.
[02:50:39.871 --> 02:50:43.677]  I mean, it just lists hundreds of things here, and it lists downloading music.
[02:50:46.460 --> 02:50:48.943]  You hear a lot about the quality of air outside these days.
[02:50:49.043 --> 02:50:52.466]  Pollution, pollen, diseases, health issues like allergies, asthma, probably die.
[02:50:52.667 --> 02:50:53.407]  Well listen to this.
[02:50:53.628 --> 02:51:02.597]  Did you know according to the American Lung Association combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside.
[02:51:02.617 --> 02:51:03.498]  6 to 10 times.
[02:51:03.518 --> 02:51:04.479]  How could I be, you ask?
[02:51:09.275 --> 02:51:10.876]  What about all those cleaners under your sink?
[02:51:11.337 --> 02:51:13.678]  Where do you think all those fumes go?
[02:51:13.719 --> 02:51:15.120]  Well, I'll tell you where they go.
[02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:17.101]  They go into you.
[02:51:17.341 --> 02:51:18.102]  Into your children.
[02:51:18.122 --> 02:51:19.603]  Am I scaring you?
[02:51:19.923 --> 02:51:20.824]  Remember this word.

[02:53:53.762 --> 02:53:56.584]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:57.384 --> 02:53:58.425]  Alright, final segment.
[02:53:58.445 --> 02:53:59.626]  Take a few calls here in a minute.
[02:54:00.006 --> 02:54:03.589]  Senate Bill 742 almost passed until there was huge public outcry.
[02:54:03.609 --> 02:54:04.850]  Republicans tried to pass it.
[02:54:04.890 --> 02:54:05.991]  Democrats were supporting it.
[02:54:06.971 --> 02:54:10.734]  And it changes the definition of terrorism to blocking traffic.
[02:54:10.834 --> 02:54:12.395]  All protesters get life in prison.

[02:54:17.128 --> 02:54:21.610]  I was reading some of the things that they say is now terrorism, and some of it's really horrible stuff.
[02:54:22.650 --> 02:54:24.791]  But then it gets into all of these!

[02:55:27.754 --> 02:55:32.058]  Everybody's got those fake hand grenades that sit on your desk, sold at every Army-Navy store.
[02:55:32.078 --> 02:55:33.559]  Because when questioned, they said that's what it was.
[02:55:34.680 --> 02:55:35.821]  This was the chairman of the committee.
[02:55:36.847 --> 02:55:40.648]  Providing false information in connection with the transfer of a handgun.

[02:56:17.302 --> 02:56:20.703]  And they've got scanners that look through your clothes at the airport and record you naked.
[02:56:21.203 --> 02:56:22.264]  I mean, that's not freedom.
[02:56:22.304 --> 02:56:25.065]  This is all Big Brother on Mach Million.
[02:56:25.845 --> 02:56:27.306]  On warp speed here.
[02:56:28.081 --> 02:56:31.444]  Nat, in Oregon, there in the center of the B system.
[02:56:31.704 --> 02:56:32.325]  Nat, welcome.
[02:56:32.705 --> 02:56:33.286]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:33.846 --> 02:56:35.308]  And I just want to say you're a patriot.
[02:56:35.548 --> 02:56:53.463]  I'm calling from the left coast, and if I have 60 seconds, I just want to challenge, I know a lot of people are listening right now, I want to challenge everyone to not just be listening, because there's a tendency for all of us to be TV zombies, to be apathetic, but we're all obligated, everyone listening, let's not just be from the group that doesn't know what happened.
[02:56:53.503 --> 02:56:53.904]  We have to
[02:56:54.420 --> 02:56:57.021]  We have to make this happen with this information and tell people.
[02:56:57.041 --> 02:57:04.646]  I've heard in your video say, Alex, that we need power of deals, reviewers, and we need to rise up and not be apathetic.
[02:57:04.666 --> 02:57:07.367]  What do you think of the Oregon bill they tried to pass?
[02:57:07.407 --> 02:57:08.588]  You know, I didn't even know about that.
[02:57:08.608 --> 02:57:15.412]  I listen to you here, I work on the internet, and I didn't even know, and that's why I'm glad that you're here, because you're letting us know.
[02:57:15.852 --> 02:57:19.634]  That shows the power, the power-mad corruption we're talking about.
[02:57:19.814 --> 02:57:21.015]  You got 15 seconds, what else?
[02:57:21.275 --> 02:57:23.376]  Well, I just want people at work, everybody to do it.
[02:57:23.755 --> 02:57:27.037]  By the videos, tell everybody, to keep our freedoms, we have to be vigilant.
[02:57:27.297 --> 02:57:28.817]  We all have a voice, some will listen, some might not.
[02:57:28.837 --> 02:57:34.820]  Some of the best tools, thanks for the call, one of the best tools is the videos, but email your whole email list, tell them to tune into the show.
[02:57:35.460 --> 02:57:37.801]  Uh, Pat in New York, last caller, go ahead.
[02:57:39.202 --> 02:57:39.962]  Hello?
[02:57:40.142 --> 02:57:40.383]  Yes.
[02:57:41.043 --> 02:57:44.324]  Uh, yeah, I just, in fact, I'm going to add a little bit to what he just said.
[02:57:44.985 --> 02:57:48.826]  Um, I was watching that C-SPAN clip that you had posted on the internet.
[02:57:50.939 --> 02:57:56.664]  Yeah, and a woman had called in and he asked her, you know, what is it that you listen to Alex Jones for?
[02:57:56.985 --> 02:57:59.587]  And she says, uh, well it just makes sense.
[02:57:59.647 --> 02:58:05.172]  And I think it's our responsibility to not just have responses that it just makes sense.
[02:58:05.472 --> 02:58:16.763]  We need to get informed and when people have questions, we need to give them answers and knock off this conspiracy theory label it has and start showing these people that it's not a theory, it's fact.
[02:58:17.170 --> 02:58:23.196]  And to get these people that are unaware of the things that are going on, solid information.
[02:58:23.237 --> 02:58:25.339]  Not just saying that Alex... You're awesome.
[02:58:25.359 --> 02:58:25.959]  You're awesome.
[02:58:26.039 --> 02:58:26.860]  We're out of time.

[02:58:31.425 --> 02:58:32.486]  We will prevail.
[02:58:32.687 --> 02:58:33.327]  God willing.
[02:58:33.648 --> 02:58:34.669]  God bless you all.
[02:58:38.177 --> 02:58:42.681]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:58:43.021 --> 02:58:47.125]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:58:47.405 --> 02:58:47.945]  We listened.
[02:58:48.266 --> 02:58:53.250]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:58:53.530 --> 02:58:54.010]  We listened.
[02:58:54.391 --> 02:58:57.433]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:58:57.854 --> 02:58:58.394]  We listened.
[02:58:58.854 --> 02:59:01.937]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:59:01.937 --> 02:59:02.558]  I don't know.
[02:59:28.754 --> 02:59:29.737]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:59:29.757 --> 02:59:31.402]  Not yet available in Iowa.
