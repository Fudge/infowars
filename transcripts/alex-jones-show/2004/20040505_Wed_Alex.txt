[00:00:05.926 --> 00:00:06.546]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.227 --> 00:00:08.268]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.988 --> 00:00:10.109]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.551]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:13.232]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.893 --> 00:00:17.516]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.077 --> 00:00:22.140]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:37.121]  Alright my friends, it is the 5th day of May 2004 on this live Wednesday edition of the Alex Jones broadcast.
[00:00:38.107 --> 00:00:39.849]  Obviously, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:46.815]  We'll have wide open phones and some great guests coming up a little bit later and a ton of vital news and information.
[00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:53.901]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:54.541 --> 00:00:57.784]  All the sites are updated multiple times daily for you.
[00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:11.687]  Well, I got up this morning and went out and did some early morning chores, and driving around I listened to National, Neocon, more Socialist than the Democrats basic front groups.
[00:01:13.487 --> 00:01:18.388]  And I heard them listing out of a new Army report the admitted torture.
[00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:20.848]  They kept saying alleged, but it's now admitted.
[00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:27.330]  I mean, it's on photos and video and a bunch of stuff we haven't even been privy to, raping people with
[00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:52.923]  Nightsticks, pouring acid on them, having police dogs attack them, busting their heads open, then sewing the cuts together, jail guards doing it in a haphazard fashion with no deadening, photographing naked women, and that's just what the photographs show, and this is admitted
[00:01:54.412 --> 00:01:58.955]  Meanwhile, the CIA, as I said last week, has put out some fake photos.
[00:01:59.075 --> 00:02:00.156]  I said, we're obviously fake.
[00:02:00.596 --> 00:02:03.598]  Try to mix those in and say, oh no, the rape photos are fake.
[00:02:03.638 --> 00:02:04.039]  No, no, no, no.
[00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.181]  The Army admits there's the photos of this going on.
[00:02:07.521 --> 00:02:10.023]  That just hasn't been released.
[00:02:10.043 --> 00:02:12.665]  So, very sophisticated disinfo going on.
[00:02:13.805 --> 00:02:14.486]  We have the U.S.
[00:02:14.566 --> 00:02:17.228]  Army report on Iraqi prisoner abuse on
[00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:22.490]  InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com as well as PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.391]  It's from MSNBC.
[00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:25.972]  U.S.
[00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:28.494]  Army Report on Iraqi Prisoner Abuse.
[00:02:29.035 --> 00:02:38.461]  Complete text of Article 15-6 Investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade by Major General Antonio M. Tagumba.
[00:02:39.442 --> 00:02:42.664]  And on page 15 gets into it.
[00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:47.408]  We're going to go over the admitted torture
[00:02:49.333 --> 00:02:49.874]  That's in here.
[00:02:49.954 --> 00:03:02.047]  But see, they're claiming that it was just these people acting alone, but the Brigadier General and the people doing the torture and others have said, look, Army intelligence controlled these wings of the prisons.
[00:03:02.888 --> 00:03:10.397]  There's over 30 of them, and they're saying 32 of them, and some other sub-prisons and other torture centers.
[00:03:12.783 --> 00:03:21.507]  And this is going on all over the country and Army Intelligence along with the CIA controls these facilities and they beat people to death.
[00:03:21.647 --> 00:03:26.730]  They torture people to death in these facilities.
[00:03:28.851 --> 00:03:32.853]  It's now being admitted that they will grab a father with his ten-year-old son.
[00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:35.454]  They will torture the son in front of the father.
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.206]  And, my friends, I listened to Neocon Radio this morning and heard two separate shows say, so what?
[00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:44.887]  Let's do it.
[00:03:45.427 --> 00:03:46.268]  This is good.
[00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:49.110]  So, Saddam's bad because he tortured.
[00:03:49.231 --> 00:03:50.512]  We're good when we do it.
[00:03:50.552 --> 00:03:53.754]  I mean, this is how sick these people are.
[00:03:53.794 --> 00:03:58.318]  And they're going to energize the fake left-wing movement in this country like never before.
[00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.439]  And that's their job.
[00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:04.648]  Making conservatism look bad, making America look bad to the U.N.
[00:04:05.088 --> 00:04:05.889]  Shutting the U.N.
[00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:08.330]  up is the good cop, the savior in all of this.
[00:04:09.991 --> 00:04:13.892]  As we said a year before the war, this will be the plan and it's been carried out.
[00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:20.756]  So when we get back I'll go over this and we'll cover what they're doing to people.
[00:04:20.916 --> 00:04:25.198]  I mean just the most, well the type of stuff New York cops do to people in bathrooms.
[00:04:25.258 --> 00:04:25.838]  I mean it's just
[00:04:27.013 --> 00:04:36.316]  As American citizens, we've been enjoying this for a long time, but now these same sickos are over there doing it under orders.
[00:04:38.117 --> 00:04:42.238]  But they'll just burn a few low-level nobodies, and we'll just move on from there.
[00:04:42.758 --> 00:04:46.299]  Meanwhile, it's part of the public debate conditioning us to accept torture.
[00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.380]  I mean, how many times have you seen them in the news say, torture's good?
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.120]  You've all seen it.
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.001]  And now it's coming home to roost.
[00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:56.019]  And the neocons, I heard them this morning, saying, so what?
[00:04:56.179 --> 00:04:56.680]  So what?
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.362]  Big deal.
[00:04:57.763 --> 00:04:59.808]  Yeah, torturing people's children, it's no big deal.
[00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:02.820]  Urgent message.
[00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:10.302]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[00:05:10.423 --> 00:05:14.024]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[00:05:14.304 --> 00:05:19.606]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[00:05:19.826 --> 00:05:24.588]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[00:05:24.668 --> 00:05:26.709]  There are thousands of violations currently, and
[00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:27.509]  The numbers are growing.
[00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:29.510]  Who needs to be HIPAA compliant and certified?
[00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.972]  The solution lies with a cutting-edge company that is redefining HIPAA training.
[00:05:33.252 --> 00:05:37.133]  Come see why this company is becoming the industry's leader in HIPAA education.

[00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:05.525]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:10.130]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.654]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:16.036]  A New World Order.
[00:06:16.957 --> 00:06:18.598]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.573 --> 00:06:41.876]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:42.176 --> 00:06:47.538]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:00.502 --> 00:07:03.983]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:07:04.263 --> 00:07:07.764]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:11.785]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:07:12.006 --> 00:07:18.167]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:18.588 --> 00:07:26.490]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:32.252]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:07:32.412 --> 00:07:36.173]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:07:36.534 --> 00:07:38.394]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[00:07:38.454 --> 00:07:40.615]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[00:08:01.265 --> 00:08:07.290]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.557 --> 00:08:20.781]  For a year now, for 14 months under the Liberation,
[00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:26.132]  We've seen photos of women, children, men being beaten, killed, tortured to death.
[00:08:26.732 --> 00:08:31.234]  This has been all over the foreign news, but we weren't meant to know about it here domestically.
[00:08:31.274 --> 00:08:37.375]  It was part of the global plan to demonize us internationally while telling us how great it was here domestically.
[00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:46.338]  And then last week some photos came out, some of them real, some of them fake, of women being brutally raped and tortured.
[00:08:47.646 --> 00:08:52.627]  And I told my webmaster, I looked at them, and I said, yeah, let's not post these.
[00:08:52.667 --> 00:08:55.248]  These are obviously just from a porn site.
[00:08:55.848 --> 00:08:59.529]  These have been mixed through on the CIA Arab front sites.
[00:09:00.149 --> 00:09:10.272]  This is so as all the news of rape and torture in the real photos and video are coming out, then the neocons can announce, oh no, it's all fake, which they're now doing.
[00:09:11.872 --> 00:09:14.453]  I mean, it's the same tactics over and over again.
[00:09:16.613 --> 00:09:22.296]  Now, what we do have is this report put out by the Pentagon, by the Army, U.S.
[00:09:23.497 --> 00:09:36.143]  Army Report on Iraqi Prisoner Abuse, complete text of Article 15-6 Investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade by Major General Antonio M. Tagumba.
[00:09:37.163 --> 00:09:44.767]  It's a 50-plus page report, but by page 16, it gets into the CID investigation.
[00:09:44.807 --> 00:09:45.988]  What they don't get into
[00:09:46.881 --> 00:09:50.582]  Is how it's admitted that army intelligence controlled these prisons.
[00:09:51.262 --> 00:10:00.864]  It was just the administration of them, that is, the funding of them and the personnel dispatches that was run by the regular army generals who are now getting in trouble.
[00:10:01.785 --> 00:10:05.526]  And the jail guards were told to do this, and that's now on the record.
[00:10:07.886 --> 00:10:12.807]  So, let's start here with the document where they get into what they know is going on.
[00:10:12.867 --> 00:10:14.948]  And remember, this is a white Washington of itself.
[00:10:16.622 --> 00:10:24.367]  I find that the intentional abuse of detainees, I thought it was torture, now it's just abuse, by military police personnel included the following acts.
[00:10:24.727 --> 00:10:30.131]  A. Punching, slapping, and kicking detainees, jumping on their naked feet.
[00:10:31.492 --> 00:10:36.495]  B. Videotaping and photographing naked male and female detainees.
[00:10:36.515 --> 00:10:43.239]  C. Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexually explicit positions for photographing.
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:51.804]  I heard one of the most degenerate, lying neocon shows out there, the Glenn Beck Show, with the fill-in host saying, so what, so what?
[00:10:52.084 --> 00:10:54.706]  He would read each one of these and say, so what, so what?
[00:10:55.786 --> 00:11:06.612]  Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexually explicit positions for photographing, forcing detainees to remove their clothing and keeping them naked for several days at a time,
[00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:08.862]  Yeah, well, fire hosing them.
[00:11:09.383 --> 00:11:12.424]  Forcing naked male detainees to wear women's underwear.
[00:11:12.784 --> 00:11:17.685]  Forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped.
[00:11:17.705 --> 00:11:20.666]  More than that, they had to engage in sex acts.
[00:11:21.827 --> 00:11:25.488]  Arranging naked male detainees in a pile and then jumping on them.
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:37.507]  Positioning a naked detainee on an MRE box with a sandbag on his head and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and genitalia to simulate electrical torture.
[00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:38.627]  Again, we have it.
[00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:40.388]  They're really electrocuting him in there.
[00:11:40.789 --> 00:11:44.171]  And because this stuff came out, they're minimizing it, just saying it was a drill.
[00:11:44.931 --> 00:11:52.756]  Writing, I am a rapist on the leg of a detainee alleged to have forcibly raped a 15-year-old fellow detainee, and then photographing him naked.
[00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:54.497]  See, this is all propaganda.
[00:11:54.597 --> 00:11:55.778]  Oh, see, they're doing it to punish.
[00:11:56.388 --> 00:12:02.772]  Placing a dog chain or strap around a nigga detainee's neck and having a female soldier pose for a picture.
[00:12:03.752 --> 00:12:08.235]  A female MP guard having sex with female detainees.
[00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:09.036]  Did you hear that?
[00:12:09.956 --> 00:12:14.239]  A male MP guard having sex with female detainees.
[00:12:14.279 --> 00:12:15.940]  Now, that's not rape.
[00:12:17.181 --> 00:12:20.463]  They just admit here, these are all the photos we haven't been allowed to see.
[00:12:21.243 --> 00:12:22.824]  And some we have that I won't post.
[00:12:23.675 --> 00:12:34.241]  Placing a dog chain or strap around the neck of a detainee's neck and having a female soldier pose for a picture, a male military police guard having sex with a female detainee.
[00:12:34.321 --> 00:12:35.262]  You mean raping?
[00:12:35.922 --> 00:12:36.783]  Forcing sex?
[00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:47.870]  Using military working dogs without muzzles to intimidate and frighten detainees, and in at least one case, biting and severely injuring a detainee.
[00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.051]  That's in the one case where they get a photo of it.
[00:12:51.525 --> 00:12:54.106]  Taking photographs of dead Iraqi detainees.
[00:12:54.587 --> 00:12:56.388]  Oh, that's a nice way of whitewashing it.
[00:12:56.728 --> 00:12:58.249]  People you beat to death.
[00:12:58.489 --> 00:13:18.520]  The troops admit, it's now admitted, Associated Press, The New Yorker Magazine, the government admits they would beat them to death, stick them in a thing of ice, put a fake IV in them, and take them out to be buried, so everybody thought, the general troops, when they left the intelligence wing, thought, oh, that person's just sick.
[00:13:21.064 --> 00:13:32.154]  Taking photographs of dead Iraqi detainees, yeah, people you beat to death, these findings are amply supported by written confessions provided by several of the suspects, written statements provided by detainees, and witnesses' statements.
[00:13:33.054 --> 00:13:38.719]  In reaching my findings, I have carefully considered the pre-existing statements of the following witnesses and suspects.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:48.468]  Jeremy Sivitz, Sabrina Harmon, these are suspects who've admitted to it, Javal S. Davis,
[00:13:49.873 --> 00:13:55.617]  Landy, England, Adele, Nakala, Civilian Translator.
[00:13:55.638 --> 00:14:03.944]  And by the way, they're saying they can't indict any of the civilian contractors who were CIA running all this because there's a loophole for them.
[00:14:05.578 --> 00:14:07.959]  And it goes on for page after page.
[00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:13.081]  Threatening detainees with a charged 9mm pistol.
[00:14:13.481 --> 00:14:15.622]  Pouring cold water over naked detainees.
[00:14:15.982 --> 00:14:18.663]  Beating detainees with a broom handle and a chair.
[00:14:19.063 --> 00:14:20.744]  Threatening male detainees with rape.
[00:14:21.404 --> 00:14:28.266]  Allowing a military police guard to stitch a wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell.
[00:14:29.387 --> 00:14:30.547]  That's what the Nazis would do.
[00:14:30.567 --> 00:14:33.008]  They'd beat you up and then without deadening sew you up.
[00:14:33.048 --> 00:14:34.069]  Or, that's a bad tooth.
[00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:34.789]  Pull that out.
[00:14:35.669 --> 00:14:40.333]  And so you got... and imagine hearing a national talk show host go, so what?
[00:14:40.493 --> 00:14:41.333]  So what?
[00:14:41.734 --> 00:14:42.594]  So what?
[00:14:42.794 --> 00:14:43.695]  They torture!
[00:14:44.436 --> 00:14:48.959]  Oh yeah, so Jeffrey Dahmer kidnaps children and eats them, so we can all do it now.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.780]  Yeah, I mean this is sick.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:51.541]  This is sick.
[00:14:53.022 --> 00:15:04.531]  Allowing a military police car to stitch a wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell, sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light, or perhaps a broomstick, using military... Did you hear that?
[00:15:06.434 --> 00:15:10.716]  Using military working dogs to frighten and intimidate detainees with threats of attack.
[00:15:11.257 --> 00:15:12.277]  And again it goes on.
[00:15:15.699 --> 00:15:19.681]  And they list here pouring acid on them.
[00:15:20.461 --> 00:15:23.343]  Pouring acid on their bodies, on their genitalia.
[00:15:24.363 --> 00:15:28.085]  This is a 55 page report.
[00:15:30.426 --> 00:15:31.527]  What do you think about this?
[00:15:32.307 --> 00:15:34.448]  And I don't listen to a lot of talk radio.
[00:15:34.508 --> 00:15:35.989]  I don't watch hardly any television.
[00:15:37.014 --> 00:15:53.543]  But I do monitor talk radio a few minutes a day, and I tune in, you know, sweatshops are good, open borders are good, well, Bush's gun control's good, torture's good, there's no New World Order, you know, arrest people that disagree with the government.
[00:15:54.283 --> 00:15:55.344]  I mean, this is what I hear.
[00:15:55.464 --> 00:15:56.424]  What are you hearing?
[00:15:56.444 --> 00:15:59.806]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:16:00.405 --> 00:16:07.650]  And I'll remind you, I'll remind you, we have an entire torture archive on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:07.671 --> 00:16:19.880]  We need to build one for PrisonPlanet.com with public officials saying torture's good, calling for it, and then there's all the fiction conditioning us, all the dramas and TV shows.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.681]  That's why I've been talking about this so much.
[00:16:21.721 --> 00:16:24.823]  See, we've been talking about torture for years when nobody else was.
[00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:25.244]  Why?
[00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:27.025]  Because they're out there promoting it.
[00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:49.367]  There's the Ithaca Journal where this Matt Gruckheimer, Army soldier, bragged in an interview in the Ithaca Journal at his family's home in Ithaca, New York, and he said, we were, quote, told there were no friendly forces, said Gruckheimer, an assistant gunner with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum.
[00:16:49.427 --> 00:16:51.329]  If there was anybody there, they were the enemy.
[00:16:51.689 --> 00:16:55.392]  We were told specifically that if there were women and children, to kill them.
[00:16:56.815 --> 00:17:03.462]  And they go on to describe, you know, they go into the town and it didn't matter, people didn't fight, they just lined up the kids and blew their guts out!
[00:17:04.103 --> 00:17:11.470]  I know it's easy to sit there decking it in your easy chair, slurping your beer, going, good, kill them kids, blow them little babies' heads off!
[00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:12.091]  Ha ha ha!
[00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:13.893]  That were the good guys now!
[00:17:14.293 --> 00:17:15.614]  You see, that's what happened with the Nazis.
[00:17:16.701 --> 00:17:23.845]  Fighting for the Reich, the Reich's been attacked, why the terrorists burned our Reichstag, why the Poles attacked our army troops.
[00:17:23.865 --> 00:17:30.309]  Of course, all that was really the German government doing it, now admitted, we gotta do anything we can to defend the Reich.
[00:17:31.729 --> 00:17:32.730]  I mean, people who were
[00:17:33.867 --> 00:17:37.730]  At every other level, very moral, had their minds warped.
[00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:47.115]  I mean, the German people were a much more moral population in 1930s, 1940s Germany, according to moral standards than we are today.
[00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:49.256]  You understand that?
[00:17:49.296 --> 00:17:50.717]  I'm not saying what they did was good.
[00:17:51.037 --> 00:18:02.084]  My point is, they took a moral people and overnight had them... One way they liked to kill people was shoving a water hose down their throat until their intestines all burst out.
[00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.091]  You know, beating people to death, all of this...
[00:18:06.886 --> 00:18:13.188]  Folks, these yuppies, if the government blows stuff up, causes a depression, they'll tell the yuppies FEMA camps, death camps are good.
[00:18:13.428 --> 00:18:16.889]  The yuppies will line up to rat their neighbors out for owning guns.
[00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:18.489]  They will worship the government.
[00:18:18.529 --> 00:18:19.449]  They will love it.
[00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:21.710]  They will watch their neighbors be carried away.
[00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:24.991]  They'll make money off buying your house after you're gone.
[00:18:25.371 --> 00:18:27.812]  They'll lick the boots of the local constabulary.
[00:18:28.012 --> 00:18:31.913]  Your daughters, no matter what you do, will beg at the feet of the black uniforms.
[00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:33.973]  They will worship them out of fear.
[00:18:34.234 --> 00:18:35.394]  They will be gods.
[00:18:36.134 --> 00:18:37.936]  You will be absolute slaves.
[00:18:38.296 --> 00:18:40.097]  And if they get your guns, they're going to do it all.
[00:18:40.978 --> 00:18:45.321]  They can flip a switch and have these yuppies begging for blood, begging for death camps.
[00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:46.902]  They won't have to hide the death camps.
[00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:47.903]  They will love them.
[00:18:49.344 --> 00:18:53.567]  Talk shows on NBC television call to put anyone who disagrees with the government in a camp.
[00:18:54.048 --> 00:18:54.868]  Openly, publicly.
[00:18:55.249 --> 00:18:56.730]  National talk shows call for it.
[00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.713]  National talk shows, multiple shows, say torture is good.
[00:19:02.222 --> 00:19:10.773]  Ah, you know, sodomizing somebody with a flashlight or a chemical something, you know, pouring battery acid on people's genitalia.
[00:19:11.154 --> 00:19:11.995]  So what?
[00:19:12.616 --> 00:19:13.136]  So what?
[00:19:13.217 --> 00:19:14.458]  It's good!
[00:19:14.719 --> 00:19:16.241]  You know how sick that is?
[00:19:16.781 --> 00:19:18.983]  That's Jeffrey Dahmer, people!
[00:19:19.604 --> 00:19:21.566]  But see, now it's good!
[00:19:21.846 --> 00:19:26.170]  Just like all the children need microchips on the news every night, it's good now!
[00:19:26.250 --> 00:19:28.632]  And cameras in the school bathrooms is good!
[00:19:28.912 --> 00:19:30.794]  It's not 1984, it's good!
[00:19:30.814 --> 00:19:33.376]  And 50 million abortions is good!
[00:19:34.037 --> 00:19:35.979]  And open borders is good!
[00:19:35.999 --> 00:19:39.202]  And Bush going to sign the assault weapons ban is good!
[00:19:39.442 --> 00:19:41.324]  It's all conservative!
[00:19:44.011 --> 00:19:45.393]  You know how sick this is?
[00:19:45.433 --> 00:19:47.216]  This sickens me to my very core.
[00:19:48.658 --> 00:19:50.240]  These yuppies will love it.
[00:19:51.081 --> 00:19:53.124]  They'll be part of the new squad.
[00:19:53.164 --> 00:19:56.008]  They're going to be out there looking, running the checkpoints.
[00:19:56.048 --> 00:19:57.270]  They're going to love it.
[00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:58.732]  They can't wait.
[00:19:59.153 --> 00:20:00.275]  They can't wait.
[00:20:01.949 --> 00:20:03.570]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:07.833]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:20:07.953 --> 00:20:10.815]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:20:10.916 --> 00:20:17.620]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:20:17.821 --> 00:20:20.823]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:20:21.023 --> 00:20:23.405]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:20:23.545 --> 00:20:28.148]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:20:28.208 --> 00:20:29.289]  We're good to go!
[00:20:52.799 --> 00:20:54.862]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[00:20:54.902 --> 00:20:55.883]  Are you running out of ideas?
[00:20:55.903 --> 00:20:56.383]  Out of time?
[00:20:56.503 --> 00:20:59.567]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:13.883]  Well, think of a song, written especially for them.
[00:21:14.184 --> 00:21:22.110]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:25.833]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[00:21:26.193 --> 00:21:34.200]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.281]  Just listen.
[00:21:43.295 --> 00:21:48.821]  Birthday coming soon?
[00:21:49.242 --> 00:21:49.922]  Anniversary?
[00:21:50.423 --> 00:21:51.144]  Wedding, perhaps?
[00:21:51.744 --> 00:21:52.705]  Mother's Day's coming up?
[00:21:53.246 --> 00:21:57.230]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.754]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[00:22:01.595 --> 00:22:04.778]  Hi, this is Jack Brauner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[00:22:05.287 --> 00:22:07.289]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[00:22:07.649 --> 00:22:10.252]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[00:22:10.613 --> 00:22:15.157]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:17.159]  But you have to act now!
[00:22:17.339 --> 00:22:23.546]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[00:22:23.928 --> 00:22:30.453]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[00:22:30.693 --> 00:22:34.236]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[00:22:34.476 --> 00:22:37.919]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.641]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[00:22:41.002 --> 00:22:41.822]  Do it now.
[00:22:42.083 --> 00:22:44.284]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[00:22:44.685 --> 00:22:51.450]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.502]  800-686-2237 that's Midas at 800-686-2237
[00:23:00.489 --> 00:23:03.231]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:05.012]  Well right now, don't wait.
[00:23:05.052 --> 00:23:10.595]  You call Term Busters and you could save up to 40% on quality term life insurance.
[00:23:10.775 --> 00:23:11.635]  Call now!
[00:23:11.655 --> 00:23:12.716]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 Here's one example.
[00:23:12.756 --> 00:23:16.138]  A male age 50, non-tobacco issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month.
[00:23:26.944 --> 00:23:28.986]  Guaranteed for 20 years.
[00:23:29.286 --> 00:23:36.032]  Call Term Busters to save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[00:23:36.052 --> 00:23:40.956]  800-430-6748 800-430-6748 We have smokers rates too.
[00:23:41.236 --> 00:23:45.519]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.343]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40%
[00:23:49.943 --> 00:23:52.184]  You know why you should be concerned about all this torture?
[00:23:52.204 --> 00:23:53.445]  Well, one of the big reasons is this.
[00:24:20.495 --> 00:24:23.497]  A few years ago, I saw some federal statistics.
[00:24:23.517 --> 00:24:30.060]  Did you know the majority of the new police enrolling over the last decade are former military?
[00:24:31.741 --> 00:24:33.442]  Many of them, obviously, military police.
[00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:40.606]  And they've gotten time raping and torturing and killing in Serbia, in Afghanistan, in 160-something countries.
[00:24:43.288 --> 00:24:45.568]  And now they're all coming back here, and so no wonder!
[00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:56.291]  Notice they call us civilians now, and they set up the checkpoints, they call themselves the authorities, and they talk about their morale on the news, how their morale's doing.
[00:24:57.811 --> 00:25:02.272]  Governors and city council members, mayors call us civilians.
[00:25:02.592 --> 00:25:06.032]  Well, they're all civilians too, but it's this terminology!
[00:25:07.433 --> 00:25:08.733]  And so these psychopaths,
[00:25:10.146 --> 00:25:17.835]  Uh, that have been out, you know, when we caught you stealing a couple sticks of wood, we're gonna shoot your car up and laugh and then run over it with a tank.
[00:25:19.837 --> 00:25:25.884]  You know, we're gonna, we're gonna sodomize you brutally with a flashlight.
[00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:29.821]  We're going to torture your children in front of you until you answer our questions.
[00:25:30.241 --> 00:25:41.347]  They're all coming back here home, and they're going to have that taste of blood in their mouth like a rabid dog, and it's going to be your daughter, your son, your grandma.
[00:25:42.398 --> 00:25:45.600]  And all the time, cops go to the wrong house and kill their own cops.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.182]  They shoot their own SWAT team members.
[00:25:47.222 --> 00:25:49.763]  They shoot a cop's daughter at a checkpoint.
[00:25:50.244 --> 00:25:52.165]  Oh, every few weeks I see where they kill their own people.
[00:25:52.185 --> 00:25:53.186]  So you're your biggest scourge.
[00:25:53.206 --> 00:25:54.227]  You're going to kill yourselves.
[00:25:54.727 --> 00:25:55.628]  I'm sad about that.
[00:25:55.768 --> 00:25:56.448]  And I'm serious.
[00:25:57.069 --> 00:25:57.969]  So look in the mirror.
[00:25:58.009 --> 00:26:00.431]  You want to see the number one threat to your safety, statistically.
[00:26:00.691 --> 00:26:01.372]  It's other cops.
[00:26:01.392 --> 00:26:01.972]  Did you know that?
[00:26:02.252 --> 00:26:05.175]  I bet they don't teach you that in the police academy, though it's the Fed's own numbers.
[00:26:05.835 --> 00:26:06.556]  So go ahead.
[00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:07.376]  Do what you do.
[00:26:08.057 --> 00:26:08.497]  Go ahead.
[00:26:08.537 --> 00:26:09.638]  You'll judge yourself.
[00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:13.008]  That's how you reap what you sow, folks.
[00:26:13.048 --> 00:26:14.609]  What you do comes right back to you.
[00:26:16.869 --> 00:26:17.969]  We're in a lot of trouble here.
[00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:19.550]  A lot of trouble.
[00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:23.070]  And we need to discuss this.
[00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.391]  Let's talk to Jay in California.
[00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:26.291]  Jay, you're on the air.
[00:26:26.351 --> 00:26:26.751]  Go ahead.
[00:26:26.771 --> 00:26:27.531]  Hey, Alex.
[00:26:27.551 --> 00:26:40.574]  I don't know if you remember last year, I'm sure you reported on this, I remember hearing you talk about it, but the headline was 4 at POW Sex Abuse Fix, where a guy was taking some pictures from, he was from, I think,
[00:26:41.221 --> 00:26:44.163]  Um, Iraq, right after the beginning of the war.
[00:26:44.804 --> 00:26:48.787]  He had taken pictures back to England and tried to have them developed.
[00:26:49.307 --> 00:26:55.492]  It showed pictures of them having sex, males having sex with each other, troopers, and sex with the POWs, male.
[00:26:55.512 --> 00:26:57.934]  It was like a male homosexual party is what it was for them.
[00:26:57.954 --> 00:27:00.516]  Yeah, I remember that.
[00:27:00.636 --> 00:27:02.258]  I mean, there's been lots of those reports.
[00:27:02.638 --> 00:27:03.939]  The guy admitted it and everything.
[00:27:03.979 --> 00:27:04.739]  He says, oh, I'm guilty.
[00:27:04.779 --> 00:27:05.760]  Okay, those are my pictures.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.762]  They said they were going to have an investigation.
[00:27:07.802 --> 00:27:09.163]  He didn't hear too much about it after that.
[00:27:09.702 --> 00:27:10.502]  That's the question.
[00:27:10.582 --> 00:27:11.903]  Why is it coming out now?
[00:27:11.943 --> 00:27:15.844]  Because they're about to have the symbolic handover to the U.N.
[00:27:16.304 --> 00:27:18.845]  So we have to be demonized first so the U.N.
[00:27:18.865 --> 00:27:20.325]  can be accepted as a savior.
[00:27:21.006 --> 00:27:23.306]  You might want to repost those.
[00:27:24.087 --> 00:27:25.707]  I can play an audio clip for you.
[00:27:26.087 --> 00:27:35.090]  Fox News at the same time last year, almost the same time, both of these reports came out about two guys being tortured to death in Afghanistan.
[00:27:36.192 --> 00:27:41.440]  And then, you know, Bush would say, you know, it's alright to put pressure on him or whatever and stuff like that.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:43.462]  Well, yeah, Rumsfeld should be arrested.
[00:27:43.783 --> 00:27:45.646]  I mean, he gave the orders for all of this.
[00:27:46.367 --> 00:27:50.472]  Let me play a short little clip from this and I'll do what I'm talking about.
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:55.341]  We're seeing torture.
[00:27:55.361 --> 00:27:58.263]  The deaths in December of two Afghan prisoners under U.S.
[00:27:58.283 --> 00:28:01.985]  control at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan were ruled homicide.
[00:28:02.365 --> 00:28:05.327]  And now the military is conducting a criminal investigation.
[00:28:05.687 --> 00:28:10.230]  With us now is Judge Andrea Napolitano, Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst.
[00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:11.391]  How are you doing, Judge?
[00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:11.771]  Good, Cal.
[00:28:11.811 --> 00:28:12.752]  Nice to be here with you.
[00:28:12.772 --> 00:28:20.457]  Why don't you inform us of the applicable laws that relate to prisoners of war taken by United States soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines?
[00:28:20.797 --> 00:28:26.079]  Well, with respect to homicides, believe it or not, it's the same basic laws that apply... Okay, that's distorted audio.
[00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:26.839]  Thank you, sir.
[00:28:27.719 --> 00:28:30.220]  Um, I appreciate the call, but the audio is distorted.
[00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:32.221]  Yeah, that's the point.
[00:28:32.241 --> 00:28:33.962]  This has been coming out for a long time.
[00:28:33.982 --> 00:28:36.723]  The neocons got on the radio and said, good, torture them to death.
[00:28:36.763 --> 00:28:39.564]  And now it's admitted they take their children in front of them and torture them.
[00:28:40.424 --> 00:28:41.204]  And other things.
[00:28:41.304 --> 00:28:42.184]  And this is the freedom.
[00:28:44.065 --> 00:28:47.826]  They admit in the Army's report that they took photos and video of them raping women.
[00:28:47.846 --> 00:28:49.487]  They just say having sex with the detainees.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.062]  Don't put the word rape in there, but what is it when you do that?
[00:28:54.662 --> 00:28:57.143]  Let's go ahead and who's up next here?
[00:28:57.203 --> 00:28:58.644]  Kathy in Texas, go ahead.
[00:28:58.964 --> 00:28:59.584]  Yes, Alex?
[00:28:59.965 --> 00:29:00.625]  Yes.
[00:29:00.725 --> 00:29:04.247]  It's a frightening scenario and I agree with you totally on everything.
[00:29:04.547 --> 00:29:06.188]  There's several things I want to mention.
[00:29:06.248 --> 00:29:06.968]  I'll do it quickly.
[00:29:06.988 --> 00:29:12.331]  First of all, I haven't heard you mention yet the connection between drugs for aggression and this torture.
[00:29:14.444 --> 00:29:24.388]  They admit, in Wired Magazine, the Pentagon gave an interview, their top futurist, looks like Dr. Evil, some 89-year-old guy, and he said, uh, we're giving the troops aggression drugs.
[00:29:24.468 --> 00:29:26.709]  Stay there, we'll come back and let you finish up.
[00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:29.671]  But listen, I was stunned.
[00:29:29.811 --> 00:29:38.995]  I can't believe that after all this, I heard two different national hosts this morning say, so what, or this is good, or, you know, what's the big deal?
[00:29:40.111 --> 00:29:41.312]  Yeah, what's the big deal?
[00:29:41.332 --> 00:29:43.794]  I mean, you know, raping women?
[00:29:43.875 --> 00:29:45.136]  I mean, what's the big deal?
[00:29:45.636 --> 00:29:47.077]  That's what the good guys do, right?
[00:29:47.778 --> 00:29:48.499]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:48.879]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.962 --> 00:29:52.863]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.343 --> 00:29:54.964]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.865 --> 00:29:58.568]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.051 --> 00:30:07.293]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:15.516]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:30:15.776 --> 00:30:22.818]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:30:23.778 --> 00:30:30.260]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.542]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:30:35.662 --> 00:30:44.544]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:30:44.804 --> 00:30:48.085]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:30:50.206 --> 00:30:50.467]  We're good.
[00:31:01.388 --> 00:31:06.912]  Old-timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:31:07.132 --> 00:31:12.695]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:31:12.955 --> 00:31:15.277]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:31:15.417 --> 00:31:16.478]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:31:16.638 --> 00:31:21.501]  Too bad the big seed companies became big green companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses.
[00:31:21.781 --> 00:31:26.544]  Artificially ripened with gas could be grown much quicker fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:31:26.844 --> 00:31:36.330]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:45.616]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:31:45.976 --> 00:31:48.198]  Call the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company at 417-924-8917.

[00:32:03.388 --> 00:32:08.873]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.293 --> 00:32:13.536]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.757 --> 00:32:20.802]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.183 --> 00:32:27.288]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.428 --> 00:32:28.649]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.969 --> 00:32:31.931]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:32.071 --> 00:32:34.092]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:34.412 --> 00:32:41.636]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:41.936 --> 00:32:45.318]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:32:45.758 --> 00:32:48.900]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:49.220]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:49.280]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:50.160]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:50.461]  Call today.
[00:32:50.521 --> 00:32:51.961]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:53.702]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.925 --> 00:33:28.990]  In the Ithaca Journal, they have troops bragging about, quote, we were told there were no friendly forces, said Guckheimer, a gunner with the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum.
[00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:32.311]  If there was anybody there, they were the enemy.
[00:33:32.431 --> 00:33:35.932]  We were told specifically that if there were women and children, to kill them.
[00:33:36.792 --> 00:33:41.714]  And the Pentagon then came out and said, well, we want to clarify, that's if it's in enemy zones, yes, we kill everyone.
[00:33:43.524 --> 00:33:45.845]  Marching with machine guns into the towns, kill everyone.
[00:33:48.007 --> 00:33:57.672]  In this big army report, they admit the rape of women, the brutal rape of men, police dogs attacking, pouring acid on people.
[00:33:59.213 --> 00:34:00.133]  This is all admitted.
[00:34:00.614 --> 00:34:05.536]  But then the CIA puts out these fake photos of some rape last week.
[00:34:05.556 --> 00:34:06.697]  We said they were obviously fake.
[00:34:07.344 --> 00:34:11.547]  And then mixes those in to confuse, now neocons can say it's all fake.
[00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:30.938]  But the army admits, they've confessed, they admit they've done all this, but what's not being brought out, it's come out in a few news articles, is the general over all this said, look, I wasn't allowed into the prisons, I just, you know, funded them and ran the logistics, the CIA and these private contractors and army intelligence were running it, and the troops have said that, well you're going to court-martial us?
[00:34:31.439 --> 00:34:33.400]  We were just following orders!
[00:34:34.798 --> 00:34:52.453]  Well, yeah, I mean, you don't just sit there out in the middle of the jail with all the troops around you in the middle of the prison, you know, down in the lockdown, down in the well, in front of all the, you know, jail doors, cells, raping and torturing and all this, if you're not authorized.
[00:34:52.533 --> 00:34:53.213]  They were told!
[00:34:53.294 --> 00:35:03.162]  Our national news was, you know, night after night, torture's good, torture's the new American virtue, the virtues of torture was, you know, headlines in news reports.
[00:35:04.332 --> 00:35:06.373]  I want to pull people's teeth out with pliers.
[00:35:06.433 --> 00:35:07.913]  I want to beat them with rubber hoses.
[00:35:08.254 --> 00:35:11.675]  We've got technology to stop their hearts and make them answer questions.
[00:35:12.755 --> 00:35:14.496]  I mean, bizarre stuff!
[00:35:17.177 --> 00:35:21.899]  So they're not releasing the photos of the raping of the women, but the military admits this went on.
[00:35:23.159 --> 00:35:26.501]  And that's posted on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:27.281 --> 00:35:30.002]  Going back to the calls, back to Kathy in Texas.
[00:35:30.262 --> 00:35:32.263]  Kathy, go ahead and continue your statement.
[00:35:32.805 --> 00:35:39.310]  Well, that is very disturbing, and I wanted to bring out, or see if you're familiar with a term called Delphi Technique.
[00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.811]  Yes, I am.
[00:35:40.911 --> 00:35:44.433]  Okay, well I did send you some information that I came across today in an email.
[00:35:44.453 --> 00:36:00.124]  If you'll look for that, it might be good for the public to, or the listeners, to learn about that, because it has been successfully used, turned the tables around, and used on the change agents, because it's used in public meetings and such, and every area of our society.
[00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:06.721]  Well, I mean, to boil down the Delphi Method is you call a public meeting to, quote, see what the public thinks.
[00:36:07.201 --> 00:36:11.323]  You listen to them and go, OK, we're going to do what you want.
[00:36:11.863 --> 00:36:13.684]  And it's what the government wanted all along.
[00:36:13.724 --> 00:36:15.485]  The people never said that they were for it.
[00:36:16.105 --> 00:36:20.467]  But by just saying we're doing what you want, that neutralizes opposition.
[00:36:20.507 --> 00:36:23.068]  So you can say, I want to paint my house blue.
[00:36:24.204 --> 00:36:26.545]  Then they stand up and go, OK, you said to paint it red.
[00:36:26.565 --> 00:36:27.766]  We're going to do what you want.
[00:36:28.226 --> 00:36:30.467]  And psychologically, that breaks them down.
[00:36:30.767 --> 00:36:37.970]  They'll have a few change agents in the audience who stand up and say what they want, and then they go with that when it was an agent to begin with.
[00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.371]  This is published government program going on for 50 years.
[00:36:41.531 --> 00:36:41.652]  Right.
[00:36:41.712 --> 00:36:43.933]  It's a military device back in the 50s.
[00:36:44.053 --> 00:36:45.353]  It's a PSYOP technique.
[00:36:45.393 --> 00:36:49.575]  But what I want to say is it has been, according to this article, I did send it to you in email,
[00:36:50.003 --> 00:37:00.805]  It's being used by some of us, you know, out here and go in in groups and you kind of sit in different places and use the same technique back on them so that we could be more successful.
[00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:04.046]  So I think it would be real educational for those that listen.
[00:37:04.566 --> 00:37:12.148]  Also I wanted to mention that eugenics, the Nazis eugenics program, actually they got that from the United States.
[00:37:12.368 --> 00:37:13.608]  From Margaret Sanger.
[00:37:14.093 --> 00:37:21.957]  Yes, and I was brought out on a 60-minute program about that kind of program that they had in the early 1900s here, the eugenics program they had.
[00:37:22.217 --> 00:37:24.219]  But it's always way in the past.
[00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:26.680]  Well, no, they just changed the names.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:29.221]  It's now called bioethics.
[00:37:31.002 --> 00:37:32.183]  Yes, it's really frightening.
[00:37:32.843 --> 00:37:33.564]  Good to hear from you.
[00:37:33.604 --> 00:37:34.604]  I appreciate the call.
[00:37:35.765 --> 00:37:37.166]  Let's talk to Mike in Florida.
[00:37:37.206 --> 00:37:38.126]  Mike, go ahead, sir.
[00:37:38.446 --> 00:37:39.187]  Hello, Alex.
[00:37:39.207 --> 00:37:43.369]  You know, I lived in the Middle East for seven years.
[00:37:44.289 --> 00:37:46.351]  I'm well aware of what the people are like over there.
[00:37:47.112 --> 00:37:53.237]  And this investigation that they're doing on the torture is not going to help anything.
[00:37:53.837 --> 00:37:57.941]  Because those people are never going to forgive, and they're never going to forget.
[00:37:58.602 --> 00:37:59.803]  I can guarantee you that.
[00:38:00.964 --> 00:38:05.888]  Well, Bush is groveling on the Arab news channels right now.
[00:38:05.908 --> 00:38:09.211]  In fact, we'll grab that clip and play it later.
[00:38:10.905 --> 00:38:14.407]  And Lord Bush is out there groveling to everybody right now.
[00:38:15.188 --> 00:38:19.590]  But again, this was ordered by our military, by our government.
[00:38:19.730 --> 00:38:26.314]  They were given policies that they knew would cause the Iraqi people to hate us.
[00:38:26.374 --> 00:38:27.134]  Then the U.N.
[00:38:27.194 --> 00:38:36.900]  comes in and just controls the resources and dominates and, you know, gives out the sterilization vaccines but acts all friendly and the Iraqis will accept it.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.121]  So this was all set up beforehand.
[00:38:40.097 --> 00:38:49.604]  Well, I can guarantee you, I would never visit the country for the next several generations, because those people over there, they're extremely close in the family.
[00:38:49.664 --> 00:38:52.506]  You heard a cousin, and the rest of the family's after you.
[00:38:53.166 --> 00:39:02.033]  And the same thing, if you cause somebody to violate the tenets of the Koran, the whole mosque will be after you.
[00:39:03.708 --> 00:39:06.350]  Well, that's why they told these foolish troops to do this.
[00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.731]  That's why the photos have been out for over a year.
[00:39:09.792 --> 00:39:11.533]  They now decide to bring these out.
[00:39:11.753 --> 00:39:12.213]  Why?
[00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:14.714]  It's all been reported here on this show.
[00:39:15.155 --> 00:39:17.816]  Why suddenly did they decide to bring it out?
[00:39:17.896 --> 00:39:20.037]  Because it's about to be the U.N.
[00:39:20.077 --> 00:39:20.658]  handover.
[00:39:21.178 --> 00:39:23.679]  They've got to demonize America further.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:29.883]  I know, and one thing that really irritates me is that I spent 20 years in the military.
[00:39:30.891 --> 00:39:38.174]  And these people accepted commands that were illegal, and they knew they were illegal, and they knew they did not have to obey them.
[00:39:38.754 --> 00:39:46.356]  And they did them anyway, and those guys ought to be taken out, and the rest of their lives should be in some penitentiary.
[00:39:47.577 --> 00:39:52.819]  Well, I agree with you, but what should happen to the CIA and the Army Intelligence and Donald Rumsfeld?
[00:39:52.839 --> 00:39:57.440]  I mean, I've seen Rumsfeld say we're torturing them, it's good, but we're supposed to all forget about that.
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:39:57.680]  Look,
[00:39:59.918 --> 00:40:04.922]  Brigadier General Rick Baucus almost two years ago left Camp X-Ray and said we're torturing people.
[00:40:05.722 --> 00:40:09.865]  You know, why isn't that being combined with these news stories, see?
[00:40:10.185 --> 00:40:13.648]  They're just blaming it on the troops, just isolating it there.
[00:40:14.088 --> 00:40:15.229]  Everything had a good idea in 1963.
[00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:20.431]  Take the CIA and send it to the four corners of the world.
[00:40:20.831 --> 00:40:21.371]  Get rid of it.
[00:40:21.531 --> 00:40:21.991]  That's right.
[00:40:22.051 --> 00:40:22.771]  Thanks for the call.
[00:40:22.811 --> 00:40:38.315]  We've had a fat-bellied, corrupt intelligence agency set up by Skull and Bones publicly as their private drug-dealing arm, and now they've moved into child kidnapping, prostitution, money laundering, and when you watch these CIA guys on TV,
[00:40:39.104 --> 00:40:40.925]  I mean, they're like gangsters.
[00:40:40.965 --> 00:40:42.966]  They're ready to be in a Hollywood movie.
[00:40:43.246 --> 00:40:44.407]  They're, yeah, we're taking over.
[00:40:44.447 --> 00:40:45.248]  Yeah, we're killing them.
[00:40:45.508 --> 00:40:46.828]  This is how we deal with it.
[00:40:47.129 --> 00:40:47.969]  You gotta be tough.
[00:40:48.289 --> 00:40:49.250]  Yeah, we got power.
[00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:50.110]  So what?
[00:40:50.511 --> 00:40:53.272]  I mean, they're a bunch of kingpins.
[00:40:53.292 --> 00:40:55.033]  I mean, they just ooze criminality.
[00:40:56.774 --> 00:41:01.717]  You know, if I saw one of these guys, you know, walking along the street, you can recognize a gangster or a criminal.
[00:41:01.757 --> 00:41:02.738]  They just ooze it.
[00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:15.455]  They've all got their private Swiss bank accounts, and they've got this rationale of, well, the world's an evil place, and we've got to be evil and control all the evil enterprises so the other evil groups don't get it.
[00:41:15.535 --> 00:41:15.815]  Why?
[00:41:15.875 --> 00:41:19.096]  And, of course, have billions of dollars in our bank accounts at the same time.
[00:41:19.136 --> 00:41:21.257]  It's a tough job, but somebody's got to do it.
[00:41:21.297 --> 00:41:23.298]  I'm so sick of you cowardly filth.
[00:41:24.558 --> 00:41:30.761]  And by the way, you scumbags arm all these people, set them up, and then we've got to go to war with them just so we can have weapons sales.
[00:41:31.783 --> 00:41:34.064]  Let me tell you something, there is a heaven, there is a hell.
[00:41:34.904 --> 00:41:40.186]  And unless you repent, and turn against what you've been doing, you're gonna go to hell.
[00:41:41.206 --> 00:41:44.247]  And you know deep in your guts, yeah, you got that fear.
[00:41:44.527 --> 00:41:49.829]  You know, you know in your bones, you know there's an afterlife, and you know you're going to hell.
[00:41:50.229 --> 00:41:53.050]  And you know that you're turning America into hell on earth!
[00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.151]  And the world into hell on earth!
[00:41:57.492 --> 00:41:58.452]  You know it, don't you?
[00:41:59.961 --> 00:42:01.322]  Look at how they treat the troops.
[00:42:01.402 --> 00:42:04.103]  Breathing the depleted uranium, giving them the deadly vaccines.
[00:42:04.764 --> 00:42:05.864]  Look at what they do to you.
[00:42:05.964 --> 00:42:07.145]  Why do you go along with this?
[00:42:07.265 --> 00:42:11.928]  Why do you... But what I can't ever get is these sicko yuppies calling in going, Yeah!
[00:42:11.988 --> 00:42:12.508]  Torture them!
[00:42:12.548 --> 00:42:13.109]  So what?
[00:42:13.509 --> 00:42:14.249]  They torture!
[00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:21.133]  Just because they do something wrong doesn't mean... Just because somebody commits a murder in your city doesn't mean you get to go out and commit murders!
[00:42:21.753 --> 00:42:22.434]  You idiots!
[00:42:22.954 --> 00:42:24.835]  And I'm talking to those neocons out there.
[00:42:26.516 --> 00:42:29.458]  I tell you what, do you have that clip of them running over the Iraqis' car?
[00:42:31.334 --> 00:42:35.796]  Well, go ahead and grab that for me, because I want to play that, here in just a few minutes.
[00:42:36.957 --> 00:42:39.218]  Because it's very, very serious.
[00:42:40.939 --> 00:42:58.429]  I played this on Monday, and it's from a PBS documentary, and this illustrates, they've been told, they're still doing this, that if somebody commits an infraction, or people that are holding up anti-coalition signs, you know, saying, Yankee, go home, they then run over their cars,
[00:42:59.381 --> 00:43:01.102]  Arrest them, take them to the prisons.
[00:43:01.622 --> 00:43:05.564]  I mean, and these guys are going to be cops back here in a few years at your protest.
[00:43:06.644 --> 00:43:18.089]  When you're out protesting, and they're laughing, they're giggling, they machine gun the car, it shows a little car with a couple pieces of wood in the back of it, they run over it with a tank and then laugh about it.
[00:43:18.569 --> 00:43:25.232]  I mean, to show the psychopathicness of it, they machine gun the car first, they run over it laughing, back, back over it again.
[00:43:26.473 --> 00:43:27.113]  It's amazing!
[00:43:29.847 --> 00:43:31.928]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in California.
[00:43:32.068 --> 00:43:32.808]  Ken, go ahead.
[00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:34.409]  Yes, the Patriot Act.
[00:43:34.729 --> 00:43:35.669]  I'm extremely concerned.
[00:43:35.709 --> 00:43:36.970]  I have a copy of the Patriot Act here.
[00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:40.211]  I ran it off on the computer, and it's absolutely chilling.
[00:43:40.251 --> 00:43:42.792]  However, the second Patriot Act is far worse.
[00:43:43.385 --> 00:43:47.887]  If these administrative subpoenas are approved, we can kiss our Bill of Rights goodbye.
[00:43:47.907 --> 00:43:52.929]  These are a blanket for any suspected misdemeanor crime.
[00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:56.331]  You can be secretly arrested and secretly executed.
[00:43:57.632 --> 00:44:02.574]  They've already implemented Patriot Act II, despite the fact they only passed part of it on December 13, 2003.
[00:44:02.634 --> 00:44:07.556]  They're already implementing it, sir.
[00:44:07.596 --> 00:44:10.277]  They're already using it against people all over the country.
[00:44:12.370 --> 00:44:20.755]  The actual wording, as you're aware, on Patriot Act 2, any law enforcement officer will be able to come to your door, which, as you say, they're probably doing now, if you refuse to answer their questions.
[00:44:20.775 --> 00:44:22.375]  In other words, you won't have your Fifth Amendment rights.
[00:44:22.596 --> 00:44:27.898]  If you refuse to answer their questions, you can be arrested on the spot, charged with obstruction of justice.
[00:44:28.279 --> 00:44:30.820]  Well, actually, they charge you with a terrorism clause.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:34.302]  Also, you notice the Fifth Circuit ruled a month ago
[00:44:35.484 --> 00:44:38.227]  That no more warrants are needed in just crime cases.
[00:44:38.687 --> 00:44:46.836]  If they want to search your house, everyone's house, and they're already doing knock-and-talks from Tennessee to Arkansas to New York to California to Arizona to Texas.
[00:44:47.316 --> 00:44:48.758]  In Dallas, they just knock on the door.
[00:44:48.778 --> 00:44:49.599]  Nice neighborhoods.
[00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:51.160]  Does your husband know?
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:52.982]  Mind if I come in and look at his guns?
[00:44:53.102 --> 00:44:53.883]  Well, why?
[00:44:53.903 --> 00:44:55.705]  We're just doing a safety check.
[00:44:56.714 --> 00:45:00.475]  And the Fifth Circuit said, yeah, you can do that, see?
[00:45:01.035 --> 00:45:06.477]  And then the Supreme Court said, you've got to answer questions, or that is resisting arrest of felony.
[00:45:07.317 --> 00:45:09.278]  So now there's no Fifth Amendment, see?
[00:45:09.578 --> 00:45:11.059]  And it has nothing to do with terror.
[00:45:11.139 --> 00:45:15.880]  Notice, every day I see articles where Homeland Security says, we're fighting terror and crime.
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.821]  We're putting up face scanning cameras to fight crime.
[00:45:19.681 --> 00:45:25.303]  Once we agreed to register firearms, we went down the wrong road, I'll tell you that.
[00:45:25.950 --> 00:45:27.751]  Because once you register, then they've got you.
[00:45:27.771 --> 00:45:28.711]  They didn't know exactly who got you.
[00:45:28.731 --> 00:45:34.553]  Well, you know, these poor saps that, you know, that don't believe in the Second Amendment, oh, well, let's save the children if we do.
[00:45:34.893 --> 00:45:41.455]  They don't understand the government's own documents say it's about controlling us, say it's about making us slaves.
[00:45:41.795 --> 00:45:43.796]  I mean, what can't you figure out about that?
[00:45:44.436 --> 00:45:47.317]  And these poor naive schmucks are going to figure it out real quick.
[00:45:47.897 --> 00:45:48.577]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:48.597 --> 00:45:51.438]  I mean, it is serious.
[00:45:51.758 --> 00:45:53.219]  Do we have that clip yet, guys?
[00:45:55.021 --> 00:45:55.682]  It's not loaded.
[00:45:55.702 --> 00:46:02.629]  They have a hard drive just frazzled on me with like, I don't know, 80-something clips of mine.
[00:46:02.709 --> 00:46:05.551]  Just go download it again off PrisonPlanet.tv for me.
[00:46:05.571 --> 00:46:06.332]  Will you do that, please?
[00:46:08.234 --> 00:46:09.355]  Okay, great.
[00:46:09.415 --> 00:46:11.637]  But George was saying that he had it in the other computer, bruh.
[00:46:13.599 --> 00:46:14.140]  Okay.
[00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:15.581]  All my clips are gone!
[00:46:15.601 --> 00:46:16.162]  This is great.
[00:46:16.542 --> 00:46:17.223]  This is wonderful.
[00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:19.076]  This is just fabulous.
[00:46:21.159 --> 00:46:25.444]  Folks, we have computers that are the equivalent of MIT at the network.
[00:46:25.584 --> 00:46:27.326]  And G. Gordon Liddy always jokes about that.
[00:46:27.947 --> 00:46:30.690]  I mean, the equivalent of Model T's, not MIT.
[00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.033]  I wish we had MIT style computers.
[00:46:33.614 --> 00:46:34.655]  Model T computers.
[00:46:35.877 --> 00:46:36.778]  Okay, well fine.
[00:46:37.398 --> 00:46:39.761]  Let's go ahead and talk to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[00:46:39.801 --> 00:46:40.802]  Elizabeth, go ahead.
[00:46:40.822 --> 00:46:41.883]  Hello, Alex.
[00:46:42.063 --> 00:46:42.664]  How are you doing?
[00:46:42.984 --> 00:46:48.891]  Good, and you know I have the Divided Kingdom at WKDI and I'm sponsoring you for the next six months.
[00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:52.167]  financially to keep you on there three hours every day.
[00:46:52.187 --> 00:46:52.887]  Well, that's wonderful.
[00:46:52.928 --> 00:46:54.209]  That's a great affiliate, Marilyn.
[00:46:54.249 --> 00:46:57.232]  Had us on for a few years and we're very thankful for it.
[00:46:57.432 --> 00:46:58.613]  And we're thankful for you.
[00:46:58.853 --> 00:47:08.122]  And as you might know on my show, I talk about I'm a native of Western Pennsylvania, descended from William Border, the expert gun maker, the Border Guns.
[00:47:08.803 --> 00:47:12.987]  And I picked up the Bedford Gazette for the weekend of May 1st and 2nd.
[00:47:13.803 --> 00:47:14.964]  This is an old paper.
[00:47:15.004 --> 00:47:17.867]  It's been published continuously since 1805.
[00:47:17.967 --> 00:47:19.628]  One of America's oldest newspapers.
[00:47:20.008 --> 00:47:25.033]  Had a great, great publisher, Hugo Freer, who had a column, Man on the Monument, told the truth.
[00:47:25.373 --> 00:47:26.634]  And look what I'm looking at.
[00:47:26.934 --> 00:47:27.975]  Heinemann Soldier.
[00:47:27.995 --> 00:47:30.037]  That's a local soldier facing court-martial.
[00:47:30.377 --> 00:47:37.143]  And I just wanted to get this out to you because the people up there are not scoundrels who would torture.
[00:47:37.423 --> 00:47:41.507]  This is a country, yet an area, that people let their doors open.
[00:47:41.972 --> 00:47:51.995]  And his wife, Martha Frederick, says that her husband in Iraq since April 2003 told her his unit wasn't given proper training and equipment.
[00:47:52.475 --> 00:47:54.956]  Quote, I feel like things are being covered up.
[00:47:55.316 --> 00:47:59.057]  What has come to light has fallen on the burden of my husband, she said.
[00:47:59.417 --> 00:48:04.058]  And Alex goes on to say that Frederick, let me tell you this.
[00:48:04.474 --> 00:48:12.258]  He said that the prison near Baghdad lacked the humane standards of the Virginia State Prison where he worked in civilian life.
[00:48:12.638 --> 00:48:18.000]  And he started keeping a journal after military investigators first questioned him in January.
[00:48:18.541 --> 00:48:25.004]  And so when he brought it up with the commander, the commander said, I don't care if he has to sleep standing up.
[00:48:25.944 --> 00:48:29.686]  Let me make that point that several of these men
[00:48:30.569 --> 00:48:40.615]  Were given these CDs, people were trading them like baseball cards, literally is how they described it, and some of the guys that blew the whistle are now being punished.
[00:48:41.455 --> 00:48:44.777]  And again, that's out in plain view, so I understand what you're saying, it's disgusting.
[00:48:44.977 --> 00:48:51.781]  Yes, I don't want to see a scapegoat, and I really don't... No, Rumsfeld has bragged on TV about torture!
[00:48:52.082 --> 00:48:54.123]  It's Rumsfeld's Army Intelligence doing it!
[00:48:54.423 --> 00:48:55.804]  Rumsfeld's behind all this!
[00:48:57.527 --> 00:49:00.029]  Isn't that great that we have leaders like this?
[00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:03.932]  Their own Army report today admits they're raping women.
[00:49:04.833 --> 00:49:06.254]  RAPING WOMEN!
[00:49:06.574 --> 00:49:07.835]  I just can't get over this.
[00:49:08.756 --> 00:49:11.458]  And naked prisoners were stacked in a human pyramid.
[00:49:11.498 --> 00:49:15.741]  Is that supposed to be one more of our nice little... See, that's all the lesser stuff.
[00:49:15.761 --> 00:49:19.284]  The few photos they released... Ma'am, that is nothing.
[00:49:19.384 --> 00:49:20.545]  They raped women.
[00:49:20.565 --> 00:49:21.746]  There's photos of this.
[00:49:22.126 --> 00:49:22.567]  Admitted.
[00:49:22.787 --> 00:49:24.168]  This is the Army report, folks.
[00:49:24.208 --> 00:49:26.950]  Not the fake CI photos they put out to confuse things.
[00:49:27.927 --> 00:49:28.767]  I'll tell you what I'll do.
[00:49:28.887 --> 00:49:31.208]  Later, I'll read back over some of the things they did.
[00:49:31.608 --> 00:49:32.908]  I think that would be very good.
[00:49:33.108 --> 00:49:33.728]  Over and over.
[00:49:33.748 --> 00:49:38.549]  Just keep bringing this to the people until they finally can't stand to sit in their apathy.
[00:49:39.769 --> 00:49:41.730]  I hear you and thanks for all your support and keep it up.
[00:49:41.770 --> 00:49:44.470]  And tell folks the call letters and frequency of that fine affiliate.

[00:49:54.413 --> 00:49:56.393]  We're getting new affiliates all the time.
[00:49:57.105 --> 00:50:04.430]  And if you're listening on satellite, or shortwave, or internet, and don't have a local AM or FM in your area, call those local privately owned stations.
[00:50:04.851 --> 00:50:06.172]  Tell them to pick up the broadcast.
[00:50:07.092 --> 00:50:09.854]  Everything we talk about on the show is posted on the website every day.
[00:50:09.914 --> 00:50:10.815]  It's all documented.
[00:50:12.031 --> 00:50:14.834]  You know, I was radical a year ago to talk about the torture going on.
[00:50:14.894 --> 00:50:21.480]  Now, again, it's... I was radical two years ago to talk about drills of flying hijacked planes into buildings that the Pentagon ran.
[00:50:21.541 --> 00:50:22.762]  Now it's in USA Today.
[00:50:23.282 --> 00:50:28.387]  You know, I was radical two years ago, two and a half years ago, to tell you that they flew the bin Ladens out on the day of 9-11.
[00:50:28.447 --> 00:50:30.549]  You know, now it's all mainstream news.
[00:50:30.569 --> 00:50:35.935]  I mean, look, if you want to hear it here months, days, years before, this is the broadcast.

[00:51:12.858 --> 00:51:15.441]  To use this disaster with a new world order.

[00:51:18.625 --> 00:51:22.850]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.911 --> 00:51:29.839]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.979 --> 00:51:31.982]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.202 --> 00:51:42.666]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:54:14.776 --> 00:54:18.498]  Warrior calls, a ton of news I haven't even scratched the surface on, coming up.
[00:54:19.458 --> 00:54:21.859]  Right now, I want to play this one more time.
[00:54:21.899 --> 00:54:23.800]  This is from the PBS documentary.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.842]  And to stop any looting going on, this is still happening.
[00:54:29.162 --> 00:54:33.464]  They machine gun the person's vehicle and then run over it with a tank and then laugh about it.
[00:54:34.325 --> 00:54:36.846]  This total gang member activity, go ahead and hit it.
[00:54:37.266 --> 00:54:39.587]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[00:54:43.146 --> 00:54:46.688]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[00:54:47.769 --> 00:54:49.730]  That child don't need to be here.
[00:54:50.571 --> 00:54:52.172]  You know where the school is?
[00:54:52.212 --> 00:54:55.154]  That's where he needs to be going, not following you.
[00:54:55.474 --> 00:54:58.877]  We filmed these G.I.s after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[00:54:59.617 --> 00:55:05.561]  We try to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take their car and we crush them.
[00:55:05.581 --> 00:55:07.002]  United States Army, tankers, whore.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:14.643]  When you shoot up, the vehicle is laughing and dancing.
[00:55:15.084 --> 00:55:15.644]  That happens.
[00:55:15.704 --> 00:55:24.874]  The tank comes over the car, and then back over it, and they laugh about it.
[00:55:25.014 --> 00:55:26.936]  Or three sticks of wood in the back of the little car.
[00:55:46.566 --> 00:55:47.746]  That's what you get when you loot.
[00:55:49.067 --> 00:55:52.769]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[00:55:53.549 --> 00:55:55.010]  The car was my livelihood.
[00:55:56.231 --> 00:55:57.872]  So that's how you win the hearts and minds.
[00:55:57.912 --> 00:56:01.033]  The total breakdown of a society under siege for 12 years.
[00:56:01.414 --> 00:56:05.216]  They catch some guys grabbing some firewood and
[00:56:06.454 --> 00:56:06.954]  They claim.
[00:56:06.994 --> 00:56:08.235]  And so they just run over the vehicle.
[00:56:08.315 --> 00:56:16.717]  And of course on Fox News it was very wonderful as they went into Baghdad with no resistance and they just showed live footage of people in bread trucks driving along.
[00:56:16.757 --> 00:56:17.377]  Nobody's shooting.
[00:56:17.397 --> 00:56:18.578]  They just shoot the vehicle up.
[00:56:18.858 --> 00:56:19.978]  Dead bodies fall out.
[00:56:20.018 --> 00:56:20.778]  They're laughing.
[00:56:20.798 --> 00:56:23.159]  It's just a lot of fun.
[00:56:23.739 --> 00:56:26.160]  And now the torture and the raping of the women and all.
[00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:27.560]  It's just good fun.
[00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:29.381]  Good conservative fun.
[00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:33.102]  But oh no, it wasn't ordered or anything.
[00:56:34.861 --> 00:56:41.407]  Folks, if you want to know about torture and the New World Order and what they have planned for you and your family, you need to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:41.447 --> 00:56:42.568]  We get into the torture there.

[00:59:10.906 --> 00:59:14.027]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.

[00:59:43.972 --> 00:59:44.293]  Big Brother.
[00:59:44.333 --> 00:59:45.013]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.355 --> 01:00:02.456]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:03.096 --> 01:00:03.916]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.677 --> 01:00:05.597]  Well, so does he.

[01:00:20.284 --> 01:00:21.665]  Alright, my friends.
[01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:26.347]  In the first hour, we mainly got into the official
[01:00:28.144 --> 01:00:41.536]  Army admission of raping of women, pouring acid on people, sodomizing individuals with instruments, just brutal torture.
[01:00:42.757 --> 01:00:45.820]  Because they can't deny any of this, that there's photos of it all on video.
[01:00:46.721 --> 01:00:48.823]  But the media is not showing you all of this.
[01:00:49.163 --> 01:00:54.428]  Meanwhile, the CIA has put out disinfo photos of rape,
[01:00:55.259 --> 01:01:00.421]  Which they can then say, oh, it's all disinfo, while the generals admit this all went on.
[01:01:00.541 --> 01:01:02.762]  So, a lot of stuff going on there.
[01:01:02.862 --> 01:01:08.445]  We've got troops in newspapers saying they were ordered to kill women and children, kill everyone in entire towns.
[01:01:09.806 --> 01:01:11.967]  That's on the website, InfoWars.com.
[01:01:14.047 --> 01:01:19.710]  Then we're going to get into Moran introduces bill to ban high-powered rifles.
[01:01:20.670 --> 01:01:23.992]  Hull, this is very scary, terror attack to boost Bush.
[01:01:24.952 --> 01:01:26.473]  And it says, terrorists, you better watch it!
[01:01:26.513 --> 01:01:29.456]  If you blow something up, it'll only hurt... I mean, only help Bush!
[01:01:30.737 --> 01:01:31.858]  It'll only hurt America!
[01:01:32.598 --> 01:01:33.239]  Well, no kidding!
[01:01:33.259 --> 01:01:35.601]  That's why the globalists are going to carry out more terror attacks!
[01:01:35.641 --> 01:01:38.644]  So that's out of the mainstream news.
[01:01:38.664 --> 01:01:41.246]  We'll be getting to that from the Connecticut Post.
[01:01:41.966 --> 01:01:46.290]  NYPD planning to install its own surveillance cameras, all face scanning.
[01:01:47.431 --> 01:01:52.135]  Poison oozes into water supply, including Prozac, you name it.
[01:01:53.594 --> 01:01:56.797]  This out of Arizona Central, Arizona Republic.
[01:01:57.237 --> 01:02:00.660]  Disney forbidding distribution of film that criticizes Bush.
[01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:05.444]  Marines arrive in Morgantown for urban warfare training.
[01:02:06.845 --> 01:02:10.427]  Court records undocumented workers got on the Navy base.
[01:02:10.447 --> 01:02:11.969]  The government's hiring all the illegals.
[01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.052]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[01:02:16.452 --> 01:02:18.694]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:02:20.916 --> 01:02:21.816]  Let's go ahead and
[01:02:22.981 --> 01:02:26.103]  Talk to Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[01:02:26.143 --> 01:02:26.583]  Go ahead.
[01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:30.204]  Hello, I'm listening on WWCR.
[01:02:30.845 --> 01:02:34.446]  I wish they would carry your third hour in the daylight time.
[01:02:36.107 --> 01:02:36.407]  Okay.
[01:02:36.968 --> 01:02:41.930]  But, you know, Pastor David J. Smith summed it all up one morning.
[01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:48.913]  He said, the Bible says all governments will invariably be controlled and ruled by the devil.
[01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:52.215]  Say that again.
[01:02:53.157 --> 01:03:04.084]  Pastor David J. Smith said that the Bible says somewhere that the governments of the world will invariably be controlled and ruled by the devil.
[01:03:04.644 --> 01:03:21.074]  Yeah, it says that all governments will be controlled by the powers, by the princes, by the principalities, but then they take the Bible and twist it, and Hitler's favorite thing was Romans 13, render it unto Caesar, but that's all taken out of context.
[01:03:22.535 --> 01:03:22.875]  Okay.
[01:03:23.176 --> 01:03:25.497]  Well, I feel like I'm the man in the middle.
[01:03:25.598 --> 01:03:34.225]  I was talking to a Christian friend on Sunday and telling him about the atrocities on the prisoners over there in Iraq.
[01:03:34.925 --> 01:03:38.188]  And he said, oh, there's rumors to the effect.
[01:03:39.629 --> 01:03:41.911]  I mean, how naive can you be?
[01:03:42.091 --> 01:03:46.414]  Well, sir, this is wanton, willful ignorance, denial.
[01:03:47.335 --> 01:03:48.076]  I get calls
[01:03:49.730 --> 01:03:58.817]  Every week on the radio, every week on the TV show, emails every day, I get attacked by talk show hosts because I'm bringing out the rumor of a draft.
[01:03:58.917 --> 01:04:14.028]  They have reinstituted the draft boards, they have twelve different pieces of legislation, they're about to make women register with Selective Service, that was the Associated Press, on Monday, and these yuppies laugh and say, that's not true, it's a rumor, you're lying.
[01:04:14.088 --> 01:04:16.730]  I mean, they're in total denial, sir.
[01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.810]  Yes.
[01:04:18.143 --> 01:04:20.764]  And then I also get it from my Democratic friends.
[01:04:21.424 --> 01:04:25.846]  Well, if you don't vote for Kerry, you might lose some government benefit.
[01:04:28.567 --> 01:04:32.048]  Meanwhile, Kerry was for the war, so was Shucky Schumer and Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:32.328]  Right.
[01:04:33.649 --> 01:04:34.609]  So there's no difference.
[01:04:34.869 --> 01:04:35.149]  Right.
[01:04:35.429 --> 01:04:36.710]  And what do we do then?
[01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.290]  We take control of local government.
[01:04:38.650 --> 01:04:40.411]  We change the hearts and minds of the people.
[01:04:41.121 --> 01:04:42.342]  Look, you watch the television.
[01:04:42.362 --> 01:04:45.204]  They're trying to train us that torture is good for the last couple of years.
[01:04:45.705 --> 01:04:47.286]  They're trying to warp our minds.
[01:04:47.746 --> 01:04:49.828]  We've got to become... Anything else?
[01:04:50.868 --> 01:04:51.729]  Well... Stay there.
[01:04:51.749 --> 01:04:52.189]  We'll be back.
[01:04:54.051 --> 01:04:55.572]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:04:55.732 --> 01:04:56.873]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:04:57.053 --> 01:05:00.476]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:05:00.576 --> 01:05:01.036]  Phenol.
[01:05:01.316 --> 01:05:08.382]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:05:08.922 --> 01:05:12.824]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:05:12.924 --> 01:05:13.385]  Fragrance?
[01:05:13.745 --> 01:05:18.508]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:05:18.648 --> 01:05:23.351]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:05:23.571 --> 01:05:26.113]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[01:05:26.393 --> 01:05:29.795]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:05:29.935 --> 01:05:33.517]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:05:33.697 --> 01:05:34.478]  No harsh chemicals,
[01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:37.080]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:05:54.898 --> 01:06:02.283]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:06:02.563 --> 01:06:07.306]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:06:07.526 --> 01:06:13.170]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:06:13.410 --> 01:06:17.932]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:06:18.152 --> 01:06:25.314]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:06:25.334 --> 01:06:26.114]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:06:26.154 --> 01:06:29.856]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:06:30.036 --> 01:06:32.537]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:06:32.757 --> 01:06:39.479]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:06:55.310 --> 01:06:56.351]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:06:56.691 --> 01:06:59.473]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:06:59.734 --> 01:07:03.897]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:07:04.317 --> 01:07:05.158]  So what do you do?
[01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:10.042]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:07:10.529 --> 01:07:12.650]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:27.836]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:07:45.726 --> 01:07:46.386]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:46.406 --> 01:07:47.147]  You want answers?
[01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:05.634]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:06.334 --> 01:08:10.276]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:10.537 --> 01:08:14.599]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:35.762]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, back into the second hour, 8 minutes and 40 seconds in.
[01:08:35.802 --> 01:08:37.542]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:39.062]  Emmett, finish up what you were saying.
[01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:45.043]  Yes, I mean, this is very touchy to get into, but do you like your steak rare?
[01:08:46.184 --> 01:08:56.445]  That hiring the Iraqi prostitutes and making the prisoners have oral sex with them... Well, the world... You're getting two different stories confused.
[01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.086]  At Camp X-Ray,
[01:09:00.225 --> 01:09:05.208]  They brought in prostitutes who were, let's just say, unclean.
[01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:06.509]  Oh, oh.
[01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:24.241]  And made these devout Muslims have sex with them, and then at camp, at the different camps over in Iraq, they make the men have sex with each other, and the troops then rape the women, and that's officially admitted in the Army's own report out today.
[01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:25.062]  Okay.
[01:09:25.602 --> 01:09:26.603]  That's close enough.
[01:09:26.903 --> 01:09:27.283]  Dirty.
[01:09:27.364 --> 01:09:28.004]  Yeah, right.
[01:09:28.885 --> 01:09:29.325]  Thank you.
[01:09:30.242 --> 01:09:32.343]  Yes, thank you for the call.
[01:09:33.224 --> 01:09:37.187]  But pouring acid on their genitalia is, I think, even a little worse than that.
[01:09:38.488 --> 01:09:41.009]  And I heard national talk shows this morning going, what's the big deal?
[01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:43.591]  Oh, letting police dogs attack them, big deal.
[01:09:43.611 --> 01:09:49.415]  You know, everything, just big deal, big deal, big deal.
[01:09:50.556 --> 01:09:51.676]  Oh, what's the big deal?
[01:09:51.696 --> 01:09:52.497]  What's the big deal?
[01:09:52.737 --> 01:09:56.760]  So next time somebody rapes a woman in your city, just go, hey, that's freedom.
[01:09:57.822 --> 01:09:59.223]  Oh, but you've got to learn double-think.
[01:09:59.263 --> 01:10:04.705]  It's bad when somebody does it locally, good when our beloved Emperor's troops do it under orders.
[01:10:05.786 --> 01:10:08.287]  Then at the same time, it's bad and we'll punish the patsies.
[01:10:09.267 --> 01:10:09.907]  Just sick.
[01:10:09.927 --> 01:10:12.509]  I mean, listeners, have you heard these neocons?
[01:10:12.549 --> 01:10:13.429]  What they're saying?
[01:10:13.489 --> 01:10:15.430]  I mean, what happened to us?
[01:10:15.490 --> 01:10:21.993]  I don't think anywhere in the world they'd go out in public and say raping women's good and pouring acid on people's good.
[01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:25.511]  I mean, I've never heard of the Nazis or the Russians or anybody.
[01:10:25.531 --> 01:10:28.551]  I mean, they did all this, but they did it secretly.
[01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:34.613]  I guess we're the most evil country in the world now, that we have talk show hosts that think it's good!
[01:10:34.633 --> 01:10:36.673]  Wow!
[01:10:36.693 --> 01:10:39.234]  I mean, I love America, but I don't love the people running it, folks.
[01:10:39.274 --> 01:10:40.554]  And they're trying to warp our minds.
[01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:45.295]  Why is every episode of Threat Matrix on ABC, torturing people, torture is good?
[01:10:45.755 --> 01:10:50.076]  Why is every episode of 24 with Keeper Sutherland on Fox, torture is good?
[01:10:51.303 --> 01:10:54.425]  I mean, folks, they strap people down and torture them to death and it's good.
[01:10:54.445 --> 01:10:58.547]  The secret police will cry and go, I don't want to do this, you made me.
[01:10:58.867 --> 01:11:00.008]  And they start electrocuting them.
[01:11:00.228 --> 01:11:03.770]  Blood starts coming out of their eyes and, oh, it's so good!
[01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:09.933]  And I hear the people calling the talk radio, torture them, torture them, torture them, you idiots!
[01:11:09.973 --> 01:11:11.013]  That's going to be done to you!
[01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:13.355]  Uh, let's go ahead and, uh...
[01:11:15.379 --> 01:11:16.920]  Talk to Lloyd in Nebraska.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.820]  Lloyd, go ahead.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:18.960]  Yes, Alex.
[01:11:19.701 --> 01:11:26.863]  Just wandering through all this reminds me of what happened in the little country of Biafra over there in Africa several years ago.
[01:11:28.043 --> 01:11:32.705]  And that was all because they created their own money system and they prospered under it.
[01:11:34.186 --> 01:11:38.387]  They didn't have the IMF or World Bank running them, so a revolution had to be fomented.
[01:11:38.892 --> 01:11:45.244]  And the way they stopped that, the international bankers brought in, as I recall, French troops.
[01:11:46.326 --> 01:11:48.470]  They create a crisis and then do that.
[01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:50.534]  Look, I saw in New Yorker Magazine,
[01:11:51.798 --> 01:12:15.269]  Back in April of 2000, a chilling, lengthy article where they said, the Oppenheimers own the beers, they have a world diamond monopoly, they have warehouses full of diamonds, this has even been on PBS, and a few African West Coast countries are shipping out some of their own diamonds, that's breaking the monopoly, driving down prices, you're about to see an invasion, a new term called conflict diamonds, they're going to try to connect it to terrorism,
[01:12:16.283 --> 01:12:23.915]  Because people are getting their own diamonds, and now we've seen U.S., British, and French troops go in there, mercenaries, you name it, and just slaughter people.
[01:12:24.235 --> 01:12:24.416]  Right.
[01:12:25.137 --> 01:12:26.239]  That's all this is about.
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:27.721]  That's your freedom.
[01:12:28.692 --> 01:12:35.237]  Look, we have DynCorp convicted two years ago of kidnapping hundreds of thousands of women and children, and this is public.
[01:12:35.277 --> 01:12:45.684]  We have huge mainstream news articles, archives on PrisonPlanet.com, the elite sex trades section, and nobody knows about that.
[01:12:45.724 --> 01:12:46.645]  That's the back of the paper.
[01:12:46.805 --> 01:12:50.688]  But we know all about Michael Cockroach Jackson, don't we?
[01:12:50.988 --> 01:12:51.168]  Yeah.
[01:12:51.469 --> 01:12:51.649]  Yeah.
[01:12:53.982 --> 01:13:00.944]  So see, it's bad when Cockroach is out there doing this stuff, but it's good when the big CIA front company is.
[01:13:02.164 --> 01:13:10.166]  We've got the same problem in our court system, I'm afraid, and I would hope that someday you could have the Court Watchers representatives on.
[01:13:10.186 --> 01:13:13.327]  I hear you.
[01:13:13.747 --> 01:13:14.787]  Is that a possibility?
[01:13:16.947 --> 01:13:18.588]  To have the Court Watchers Association on?
[01:13:18.988 --> 01:13:22.969]  Right, so that we could know locally how and what to do to get
[01:13:24.355 --> 01:13:27.496]  That type of organization going in our individual areas.
[01:13:28.096 --> 01:13:30.577]  Well, Lloyd, I've talked to the folks that run that group.
[01:13:30.597 --> 01:13:32.517]  They've written articles, and I do mean to get them on.
[01:13:32.998 --> 01:13:33.278]  Okay.
[01:13:33.518 --> 01:13:34.378]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:36.178]  Steve in Ohio.
[01:13:36.238 --> 01:13:36.979]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:13:36.999 --> 01:13:38.259]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:13:38.299 --> 01:13:39.359]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:13:39.699 --> 01:13:40.120]  Thank you.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:45.741]  I wanted to echo a previous caller there about the forces of evil taking over government.
[01:13:46.441 --> 01:13:48.282]  When Christ was standing on the prefaces,
[01:13:49.522 --> 01:13:53.086]  The devil said, hey, I run all this.
[01:13:53.106 --> 01:13:53.547]  That's right.
[01:13:53.587 --> 01:13:55.409]  If you bow down to me, I'll give it all to you.
[01:13:55.489 --> 01:13:58.012]  So if he didn't own it, he wouldn't have been able to give it away.
[01:13:58.453 --> 01:14:08.986]  And so according to Romans 13, if we're supposed to worship government, if God gave the devil control over government, why, well then according to these preachers, Jesus should have bowed down to Lucifer.
[01:14:09.787 --> 01:14:11.268]  No, I'm not being sarcastic there!
[01:14:11.468 --> 01:14:32.388]  They say, worship government, follow what it says, God put it there over you, totally out of context, total fraud, but according to that, when the devil had him up there after, what, 30 days and nights of fasting, up on the mountaintop, and he said, I control all this, I can put you over it, Christ should have bowed down to Lucifer and said, yes, Romans 13, I'm supposed to follow you.
[01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:32.948]  Right.
[01:14:33.249 --> 01:14:34.029]  What do you say to that?
[01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:36.132]  I think he made the right choice.
[01:14:36.152 --> 01:14:37.973]  I was calling about... Well, of course!
[01:14:38.054 --> 01:14:42.178]  But according to these preachers, Christ should have knelt before Lucifer!
[01:14:42.658 --> 01:14:52.909]  I think Pat Robertson's got a special padded room in hell waiting for him when he gets done with his diatribe on abortion is good and the Chinese are doing the right thing.
[01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:55.753]  I was calling about the Glenn Beck Show.
[01:14:55.793 --> 01:14:56.454]  I listened to that.
[01:14:56.494 --> 01:14:57.274]  I tried to get in.
[01:14:57.294 --> 01:14:58.694]  Did you hear him saying?
[01:14:58.874 --> 01:14:59.174]  Yeah.
[01:14:59.294 --> 01:15:00.954]  Oh, pouring acid on people!
[01:15:01.014 --> 01:15:01.615]  Big deal!
[01:15:01.715 --> 01:15:02.055]  Rape!
[01:15:02.115 --> 01:15:02.675]  Big deal!
[01:15:02.835 --> 01:15:07.796]  Well, I was going to call in and say, well, I guess it was six million Jews in Dachau and Birkenau and the other camps.
[01:15:07.896 --> 01:15:10.436]  That was a big deal, too, right?
[01:15:10.736 --> 01:15:11.756]  Now, you're a witness to this.
[01:15:11.776 --> 01:15:12.757]  Did you not hear?
[01:15:13.337 --> 01:15:14.337]  It's not just Savage.
[01:15:14.677 --> 01:15:15.657]  Others are doing it now.
[01:15:16.097 --> 01:15:17.457]  That, oh, big deal!
[01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:18.698]  Oh, attack dogs!
[01:15:19.218 --> 01:15:20.078]  Oh, big deal!
[01:15:20.615 --> 01:15:23.701]  Yeah, I mean, they're sick, they're perverse, they're evil.
[01:15:24.121 --> 01:15:27.007]  Folks, the Nazis didn't get on radio and brag about it.
[01:15:27.067 --> 01:15:30.473]  No one has ever, ever, ever done this.
[01:15:30.553 --> 01:15:32.477]  We have broken new ground.
[01:15:34.449 --> 01:15:42.157]  Well, after listening to you for a couple, three years, I cannot even tolerate to watch very much of the nightly news, the rest of it, just because of the propaganda and the lies.
[01:15:42.217 --> 01:15:46.281]  And again, the nightly news is the fake liberal news, and the radio is the fake conservative news.
[01:15:46.301 --> 01:15:46.602]  Right.
[01:15:46.902 --> 01:15:52.668]  And it's just, it's all... And then we've got the simpering liberals who just want our guns so they can do all this to us in an orderly fashion.
[01:15:54.249 --> 01:15:55.671]  I'm afraid they're going to come for them.
[01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:59.470]  Come for them, and then that's where we can all draw our own lines in the sand.
[01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:00.511]  That's right, baby.
[01:16:02.251 --> 01:16:03.512]  So describe what you heard.
[01:16:03.552 --> 01:16:08.914]  I mean, I was flipping through channels and heard this on two separate shows, and that was in 15 minutes in the car.
[01:16:09.394 --> 01:16:10.434]  What did you hear?
[01:16:10.995 --> 01:16:19.558]  What I heard was any atrocity, whatever that they could imagine or come up with, was okay to fight terrorism and get the information they needed.
[01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:25.215]  And you can elicit anything out of anybody if you torture them long enough and hard enough.
[01:16:25.235 --> 01:16:26.596]  They'll say anything you want to hear.
[01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:29.619]  You can't believe a government that tortures number one.
[01:16:29.639 --> 01:16:33.423]  I mean, look, it's so... look.
[01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.825]  And then they say, oh, these are terrorists in there.
[01:16:35.885 --> 01:16:43.573]  They admit it's people that didn't pay their tax, were caught with a rifle, were selling food without a license.
[01:16:44.033 --> 01:16:44.914]  This is all admitted!
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:53.105]  The general over Camp X-Ray in Guantanamo quit and said, number one, these aren't even Taliban or Al-Qaeda, number two, I'm not going to torture people!
[01:16:53.385 --> 01:16:56.247]  I have teenage boys that are in Camp X-Ray that are torturing people.
[01:16:56.267 --> 01:17:04.853]  Sir, I have no fewer than five articles mainstream in front of me that aren't on the national news where they took Iraqi cameraman in there and would torture their children in front of them.
[01:17:05.013 --> 01:17:05.193]  Yeah.
[01:17:05.693 --> 01:17:09.176]  Torturing people's children now is good.
[01:17:09.556 --> 01:17:10.217]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:10.377 --> 01:17:10.637]  Thank you.
[01:17:10.997 --> 01:17:13.739]  And there was a CIA section chief in the Washington Post
[01:17:14.617 --> 01:17:17.499]  I think it was early 2002 or late 2001.
[01:17:18.699 --> 01:17:19.800]  It's in two of my films.
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.761]  Paul, find that and repost it.
[01:17:23.142 --> 01:17:26.423]  I think the headline was, detainees being flown to third-party countries.
[01:17:26.463 --> 01:17:27.384]  I think that was the headline.
[01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:34.187]  And in there it said, oh yeah, we take them to Jordan and Egypt where we can torture their children.
[01:17:35.608 --> 01:17:38.369]  I mean, torturing people's children now is good?
[01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.610]  I mean, what?
[01:17:43.133 --> 01:17:43.693]  Oh, man.
[01:17:43.813 --> 01:17:44.973]  Marge in Colorado.
[01:17:45.013 --> 01:17:45.814]  Marge, go ahead.
[01:17:46.334 --> 01:17:50.334]  Oh, Alex, I was just sitting here thinking, I'm so upset.
[01:17:50.514 --> 01:17:53.215]  I hope I don't muddle this up.
[01:17:54.655 --> 01:18:00.096]  But I have a Vietnam veteran here at home, and I still have my husband, a World War II veteran.
[01:18:01.116 --> 01:18:03.337]  And this upsets all of us to hear this.
[01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:11.438]  I really wonder if it isn't that coffee anon, because I have it taped at Rwanda.
[01:18:12.546 --> 01:18:15.428]  And who furnished all those people with those machetes?
[01:18:15.948 --> 01:18:16.929]  Well, no, the U.N.
[01:18:17.009 --> 01:18:21.933]  actually would line them up with machine gun them and put them in a camp and pull back for the Hutus to kill them.
[01:18:22.733 --> 01:18:23.614]  That's all admitted.
[01:18:23.734 --> 01:18:24.775]  Oh, look!
[01:18:25.395 --> 01:18:28.737]  Look, I mean, Kofi Annan is part of this, but he's just a puppet like Bush.
[01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:33.541]  This is meant to make America look bad by design.
[01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:36.383]  They know it, and that's what I believe.
[01:18:37.043 --> 01:18:39.385]  And I don't believe that the American boy
[01:18:40.436 --> 01:18:42.117]  Is capable of some of this.
[01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:49.459]  I have a feeling that there's a lot of this that's... Well ma'am, ma'am, they hired sadistic jail guards that are doing this to our people.
[01:18:49.719 --> 01:18:51.820]  They hired them, gave them bonuses to sign up.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.061]  They have special psychological tests they give them.
[01:18:56.742 --> 01:18:57.122]  Okay?
[01:18:57.442 --> 01:19:02.383]  They have special... Look, the smart psychopath goes and joins military intelligence.
[01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:04.744]  Or goes and joins the CIA.
[01:19:05.064 --> 01:19:07.105]  It's a special SS cadre.
[01:19:08.586 --> 01:19:09.826]  Under Rumsfeld's control.
[01:19:11.277 --> 01:19:12.918]  Well, I think they're drugged, too.
[01:19:13.099 --> 01:19:13.819]  Something is wrong.
[01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:14.680]  Oh, that's admitted.
[01:19:15.441 --> 01:19:20.125]  They give the special forces aggression drugs and then they give them amnesics.
[01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:24.168]  After they line up 3,000 people and kill them, they then give them an amnesic.
[01:19:24.208 --> 01:19:25.329]  That's been in mainstream news.
[01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:27.711]  Well, this is just horrible.
[01:19:27.892 --> 01:19:31.595]  I've never been so upset in my life listening to this.
[01:19:32.696 --> 01:19:34.938]  What do you think about the talk show hosts that say it's good?
[01:19:36.619 --> 01:19:37.680]  Well, you know,
[01:19:39.515 --> 01:19:44.081]  Anymore, we don't know what to believe or what we see.
[01:19:44.302 --> 01:19:46.184]  I don't even believe what I see anymore.
[01:19:49.028 --> 01:19:50.951]  Well, anyway, thanks for listening, Alex.
[01:19:51.251 --> 01:19:51.672]  Thank you.
[01:19:51.712 --> 01:19:52.212]  God bless you.

[01:22:59.570 --> 01:23:03.031]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.

[01:23:54.117 --> 01:23:59.758]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:05.460]  Alright, the next segment I'm going to blitz through some news, then go back to your calls.
[01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:06.120]  I want to just
[01:24:07.153 --> 01:24:08.635]  We've taken a lot of calls so far.
[01:24:08.695 --> 01:24:15.362]  I want to take another 40 calls before this broadcast ends in an hour and 35 and a half minutes.
[01:24:16.444 --> 01:24:19.427]  And so when you hear somebody hang up, try to call right in and get in.
[01:24:19.447 --> 01:24:19.607]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:26.059 --> 01:24:26.139]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:26.319 --> 01:24:30.561]  This was done by design.
[01:24:30.601 --> 01:24:33.822]  You've seen the officials all over TV saying how torture's good.
[01:24:34.262 --> 01:24:36.263]  The newspaper articles how torture's good.
[01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:38.464]  The dramas on television.
[01:24:38.604 --> 01:24:39.424]  Every episode.
[01:24:39.444 --> 01:24:42.725]  The Shield, NYPD, Blue, Threat Matrix, 24.
[01:24:44.166 --> 01:24:44.906]  All these shows.
[01:24:44.966 --> 01:24:47.107]  Torture, torture, torture, torture, torture.
[01:24:47.167 --> 01:24:48.387]  Law enforcement magazines.
[01:24:48.447 --> 01:24:49.207]  Torture's good.
[01:24:50.808 --> 01:24:51.908]  They've been ordered to do it.
[01:24:51.988 --> 01:24:53.369]  Now they're going to burn some patches.
[01:24:54.526 --> 01:24:56.987]  The Army's own report says they raped women.
[01:24:57.828 --> 01:24:59.608]  Poured acid on their genitals.
[01:25:00.269 --> 01:25:01.249]  It goes on and on.
[01:25:02.110 --> 01:25:03.410]  Police dogs attacking them.
[01:25:03.530 --> 01:25:03.991]  You name it.
[01:25:04.531 --> 01:25:06.312]  Now they're going to come back here and be cops.
[01:25:07.592 --> 01:25:09.933]  Many of them were already police they hired to go over there.
[01:25:09.973 --> 01:25:11.974]  This is what we've been living under for a long time.
[01:25:12.254 --> 01:25:15.736]  But when it happens to an old lady or a citizen, nothing is done.
[01:25:17.839 --> 01:25:21.402]  Now, people point out, well, the Iraqis torture, the Arabs will torture Christians.
[01:25:21.462 --> 01:25:22.383]  Yeah, and it's wrong.
[01:25:22.804 --> 01:25:25.286]  Just because somebody does something evil doesn't mean we should do it.
[01:25:25.706 --> 01:25:28.970]  If somebody commits a murder in your town, it doesn't mean you can go out and commit a murder.
[01:25:28.990 --> 01:25:30.351]  It doesn't absolve you!
[01:25:31.852 --> 01:25:34.455]  Just because you're living in Sodom and Gomorrah doesn't mean it's okay.
[01:25:35.596 --> 01:25:37.838]  Let's go ahead and talk to Henry.
[01:25:38.556 --> 01:25:40.317]  Henry, another caller from Colorado.
[01:25:40.357 --> 01:25:41.118]  Henry, go ahead.
[01:25:41.458 --> 01:25:41.898]  Yes, sir.
[01:25:41.958 --> 01:25:51.525]  Thank you for taking this call, and you're right on the money when you talk about being programmed with the shows as far as FEMA and all these other agencies.
[01:25:51.585 --> 01:25:52.946]  CSI is our savior.
[01:25:52.986 --> 01:25:54.167]  It's got to torture you.
[01:25:55.007 --> 01:26:02.532]  Every time I turn one on, they're violating people's rights, they're torturing people, and it's always good.
[01:26:03.033 --> 01:26:04.174]  I wanted to make a comment.
[01:26:04.294 --> 01:26:06.735]  I am a former Marine Corps and U.S.
[01:26:06.815 --> 01:26:07.636]  Army infantryman.
[01:26:08.553 --> 01:26:26.901]  And one of the things we specifically tried to do in our more realistic war games was specifically not get captured because even in these war games we had they had organizations called MI which had these sadistic female lesbian types that would go
[01:26:28.824 --> 01:26:31.746]  Let's say a little overboard with the interrogation process.
[01:26:31.886 --> 01:26:34.627]  Oh, that's their... I'm not just saying this to be mean, folks.
[01:26:34.707 --> 01:26:37.929]  That seems to be the types they put in these prisons, in these positions.
[01:26:38.309 --> 01:26:41.190]  Statistics show, for some reason, they're the most vicious people.
[01:26:41.931 --> 01:26:48.074]  And you're saying even in the war game training, in your survival training, when you got captured, what would they do to you?
[01:26:48.794 --> 01:26:56.498]  Well, it never particularly happened to me, but I've heard cases of people, men being slapped, sexually demoralized, being forced to be...
[01:26:57.759 --> 01:27:01.161]  I live right outside of Fort Carson, Colorado and I'm seeing a bunch of G.I.s coming back
[01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:36.071]  Some are claiming to be getting out due to conscientious objectivity and there's a lot of troops converting to Islam.
[01:27:36.211 --> 01:27:38.173]  I was wondering if there was a statistic on that?
[01:27:39.235 --> 01:27:56.056]  Well, anytime, yeah there is, anytime people are oppressing and doing wrong to a group, they will, a lot of them, people morally, and I'm not saying that's a good thing that they're converting, my point is that they will convert to it because they know they're doing evil, what they're fighting must be good.
[01:27:56.736 --> 01:27:57.337]  You understand?
[01:27:57.357 --> 01:27:58.799]  So that's the psychology there.
[01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:01.363]  Well, Mr. Jones, thank you so much.
[01:28:01.823 --> 01:28:02.403]  Anything else?
[01:28:02.463 --> 01:28:08.085]  I mean, I mean, what is the military saying your friends, your friends that are still in, about all this torture?
[01:28:08.345 --> 01:28:13.127]  Well, there's a lot of people just getting out, not re-enlisting, or just getting undiscussed.
[01:28:13.147 --> 01:28:15.308]  A lot of people don't want to even talk about things they've seen.
[01:28:15.328 --> 01:28:18.489]  Have they told you what they've seen?
[01:28:19.269 --> 01:28:26.632]  I've, um, well, your younger troops tend to be, there's a psychology, you can take a 17, 18 year old,
[01:28:28.541 --> 01:28:30.182]  I'm going to charge that at him when he will.
[01:28:31.022 --> 01:28:42.028]  And your guys that have a little bit more conscious to them, you see the young kids all gung-ho about what they're doing, but it's going to take until they reach 30 or 40 where the conscious sets in.
[01:28:43.848 --> 01:28:46.070]  But there is a sadistic streak.
[01:28:46.890 --> 01:28:50.992]  I don't know whether it's medication, injections, or what, but you can see it.
[01:28:51.772 --> 01:28:54.053]  Have you seen things change since you were in?
[01:28:54.894 --> 01:28:55.714]  Yes, quite a bit.
[01:28:57.859 --> 01:29:00.700]  It's not even rules of engagement, everything.
[01:29:01.501 --> 01:29:05.862]  No one's even questioning the legality of the operations.
[01:29:06.302 --> 01:29:13.125]  What do you think of national talk show hosts calling for torture and saying that the torture is no big deal?
[01:29:14.066 --> 01:29:16.066]  Well, it sickens me, but it's out there.
[01:29:16.126 --> 01:29:18.087]  I got one in particular I can't stand.
[01:29:18.127 --> 01:29:20.388]  That's Savage and Mr. Medved.
[01:29:21.208 --> 01:29:27.371]  And another thing I want to congratulate you on is that you very boldly accept all your calls.
[01:29:28.641 --> 01:29:29.962]  Oh, we don't screen calls, no.
[01:29:30.422 --> 01:29:31.223]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[01:29:31.383 --> 01:29:31.823]  Thank you.
[01:29:31.883 --> 01:29:35.485]  No, these neocons have to, because they've got something to hide.
[01:29:36.306 --> 01:29:37.627]  They're a bunch of socialist filth.
[01:29:37.667 --> 01:29:38.627]  They've got something to hide.
[01:29:38.827 --> 01:29:40.528]  We have nothing to hide.
[01:29:44.151 --> 01:29:45.051]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.532 --> 01:29:47.153]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.073 --> 01:29:50.755]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:57.178]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:57.478 --> 01:30:02.400]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.661 --> 01:30:07.023]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:07.323 --> 01:30:16.228]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.428 --> 01:30:20.070]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:25.373]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.674 --> 01:30:32.398]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.878 --> 01:30:33.439]  What about you?
[01:30:34.182 --> 01:30:39.085]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.
[01:30:39.125 --> 01:30:39.545]  A $14 savings.
[01:30:39.585 --> 01:30:40.746]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:40.766 --> 01:30:42.647]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:56.047 --> 01:31:01.531]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.971 --> 01:31:06.194]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:06.434 --> 01:31:13.479]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:19.964]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:20.104 --> 01:31:21.325]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.645 --> 01:31:24.608]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:24.748 --> 01:31:26.790]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:27.090 --> 01:31:34.337]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:34.617 --> 01:31:38.000]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:45.081]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:31:45.101 --> 01:31:47.322]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:47.342 --> 01:31:48.222]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:48.502 --> 01:31:52.743]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[01:31:53.403 --> 01:31:56.184]  What kind of gift can you give to someone who has everything?
[01:31:56.604 --> 01:31:57.684]  Are you running out of ideas?
[01:31:58.144 --> 01:31:58.764]  Out of time?
[01:31:59.244 --> 01:32:02.425]  How can you surprise your loved ones with a gift they'll never expect?
[01:32:03.123 --> 01:32:05.945]  Well, think of a song written especially for them.
[01:32:06.245 --> 01:32:14.191]  And all you have to do is go to www.songsforever.com and provide us all the information about that special someone.
[01:32:14.611 --> 01:32:17.914]  Interesting facts, unique things about him, and all you can think of.
[01:32:18.254 --> 01:32:26.280]  Songsforever.com will use that information brought to us by you to compose a unique song with original lyrics inspired by everything you've told us.
[01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.341]  Just listen.
[01:32:35.368 --> 01:32:40.892]  Birthday coming soon?
[01:32:41.292 --> 01:32:41.993]  Anniversary?
[01:32:42.493 --> 01:32:43.214]  Wedding perhaps?
[01:32:43.814 --> 01:32:44.755]  Mother's Day coming up?
[01:32:45.315 --> 01:32:49.278]  Just go to www.songsforever.com.
[01:32:49.739 --> 01:32:52.040]  That's www.songsforever.com.
[01:33:03.949 --> 01:33:13.414]  I remember five years ago buying law enforcement magazines off the store shelf when I'd be in a 7-Eleven.
[01:33:14.914 --> 01:33:20.877]  And it would talk about situational ethics, how torture was good, how police should start using torture in America.
[01:33:22.758 --> 01:33:25.999]  Law enforcement magazines that say, if you've got an anti-U.N.
[01:33:26.039 --> 01:33:28.240]  sticker on the car, go ahead and arrest the person.
[01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:29.301]  They're probably a terrorist.
[01:33:29.361 --> 01:33:31.442]  And police chiefs, support your officers.
[01:33:31.502 --> 01:33:33.403]  Find something to incarcerate these people for.
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:41.322]  And you know that all the shows, how good torture is, like somebody flipped a light switch just getting you ready for all this.
[01:33:43.043 --> 01:33:45.384]  We've been here warning you about all the trends.
[01:33:45.444 --> 01:33:48.445]  We know what the globalists are going to do from their propaganda.
[01:33:48.805 --> 01:33:54.587]  I knew they were about to attack New York using Bin Laden as the patsy puppet, the CIA asset to take the blame.
[01:33:55.770 --> 01:33:58.571]  Months before 9-11 because of the propaganda.
[01:33:58.671 --> 01:34:01.513]  At that time I would make myself watch hours of television a day.
[01:34:02.013 --> 01:34:04.814]  I really should still do it, I'm just, I can't make myself.
[01:34:05.254 --> 01:34:10.496]  It's too painful to watch actual psychopathic killers on TV posing as our saviors.
[01:34:11.177 --> 01:34:19.961]  I can still read the news and get a lot of the data, but right before 9-11 they introduced, here's Bin Laden, he's the boogeyman, he's about to attack you.
[01:34:20.701 --> 01:34:23.322]  You know, now they say torture's good, you need to go along with it.
[01:34:24.592 --> 01:34:26.533]  This is all part of the conditioning process.
[01:34:26.573 --> 01:34:28.593]  You know what they're doing from their propaganda.
[01:34:30.194 --> 01:34:32.175]  I will go back to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:34:32.295 --> 01:34:33.375]  I wanted to talk about this.
[01:34:34.075 --> 01:34:38.957]  There are over a million cameras put up in the name of security and traffic management.
[01:34:40.477 --> 01:34:49.120]  In the United States there are hundreds of thousands of microphones that we know of with powerful shotgun mics that go out several hundred yards.
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:54.944]  As I walk down the street, I can watch the cameras following me, and the microphones following me.
[01:34:54.984 --> 01:34:56.025]  It's all part of the freedom.
[01:34:56.165 --> 01:34:59.307]  You tell the average yuppie about it, they'll laugh at you, and you'll say, see the cameras?
[01:34:59.367 --> 01:34:59.527]  What?
[01:34:59.608 --> 01:35:00.328]  I don't see cameras!
[01:35:00.348 --> 01:35:00.869]  You're a kook!
[01:35:01.149 --> 01:35:02.270]  Well, there's a camera!
[01:35:03.231 --> 01:35:05.132]  Or, a national draft is coming!
[01:35:05.172 --> 01:35:05.693]  No, it's not!
[01:35:05.713 --> 01:35:06.353]  Well, here's the bill!
[01:35:06.473 --> 01:35:07.534]  Ah, shut up, liberal!
[01:35:08.015 --> 01:35:11.437]  If it's a conservative, you know, if it's a socialist, shut up, fascist!
[01:35:12.198 --> 01:35:13.779]  You know, I don't have any responsibility.
[01:35:13.819 --> 01:35:15.921]  I'm just a groveling worm, they say.
[01:35:17.142 --> 01:35:18.083]  So this is everywhere.
[01:35:19.079 --> 01:35:24.400]  But in New York, they're going to put in a billion dollars worth of these.
[01:35:24.881 --> 01:35:36.884]  Now, any digital camera that's of enough quality, just mid-grade quality, is going to be fed through the Faceit technology, the different softwares out there, Wom's Faceit, CIA front company.
[01:35:38.624 --> 01:35:42.525]  Any of this can be fed through and be used for face scanning, the track and trace and control.
[01:35:43.266 --> 01:36:03.743]  But now New York wants its own grid, it's Hercules team wants it, NYPD planning to install its own surveillance cameras, the NYPD is reportedly planning to install hundreds of cameras, not hundreds folks, it's thousands for a billion bucks, of cameras around the city that can automatically recognize the face of suspected criminals, see criminals or terrorists.
[01:36:04.664 --> 01:36:08.127]  And then now you haven't paid your tickets, can't fly, you see.
[01:36:09.052 --> 01:36:10.093]  You try to board a plane.
[01:36:10.153 --> 01:36:11.453]  Caps 2 says you got a ticket.
[01:36:11.473 --> 01:36:12.134]  You get arrested.
[01:36:12.174 --> 01:36:13.834]  No water for 24 hours.
[01:36:13.894 --> 01:36:14.715]  Hadn't paid a debt.
[01:36:14.995 --> 01:36:16.395]  No water for 24 hours.
[01:36:16.676 --> 01:36:17.916]  You're charged with terrorism.
[01:36:17.936 --> 01:36:18.636]  Trying to fly.
[01:36:18.656 --> 01:36:20.377]  Now, this is all mainstream now.
[01:36:21.058 --> 01:36:21.578]  I'm not kidding.
[01:36:21.598 --> 01:36:26.160]  You see, everywhere you go, the face scanning camera at the grocery store will say you hadn't paid your ticket.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:26.600]  Sorry.
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:28.441]  No food until you've paid your tickets.
[01:36:28.501 --> 01:36:30.062]  They've said they're going to do this.
[01:36:30.402 --> 01:36:32.122]  Well, you need to pay your fair share.
[01:36:32.383 --> 01:36:33.563]  And then more and more crimes.
[01:36:33.623 --> 01:36:34.343]  More and more tickets.
[01:36:34.624 --> 01:36:35.604]  More and more fees.
[01:36:36.625 --> 01:36:37.605]  This is the beast system.
[01:36:38.191 --> 01:36:43.856]  There are already tens of thousands of private surveillance cameras, they're not private, trained on city streets and buildings.
[01:36:43.876 --> 01:36:47.940]  According to the New York Post, the NYPD wants to install its own centralized system.
[01:36:49.139 --> 01:36:56.741]  And it says that Deputy Commissioner James Alfo is working on a plan for up to 1 billion in new computer and camera equipment.
[01:36:56.761 --> 01:37:04.163]  According to the Post, facial recognition technology would allow police to pick out and follow suspects in high crime areas and near potential terror targets.
[01:37:04.183 --> 01:37:06.344]  So now it's crime and terror.
[01:37:06.424 --> 01:37:07.144]  Crime and terror.
[01:37:07.664 --> 01:37:10.485]  And they've announced face scanning cameras going up nationwide.
[01:37:10.785 --> 01:37:14.526]  This is all through Homeland Security to fight crime, not terror.
[01:37:14.806 --> 01:37:18.247]  They're now going to fight crime and use the Patriot Act on all citizens.
[01:37:20.414 --> 01:37:21.975]  They've announced this across the board.
[01:37:23.356 --> 01:37:24.177]  They're doing this.
[01:37:24.697 --> 01:37:34.324]  Go ahead and... Since they plan to have the cameras installed by this summer's Republican National Convention, go ahead and hit this New York One News piece.
[01:37:34.444 --> 01:37:34.704]  Hit it.
[01:37:35.405 --> 01:37:42.690]  There are thousands of private surveillance cameras watching your every move around the city, but the NYPD reportedly wants to see more.
[01:37:43.203 --> 01:37:50.927]  According to the New York Post, Deputy Commissioner James Analfo is working on a plan for up to a billion dollars in new computer and camera equipment.
[01:37:51.448 --> 01:38:00.553]  The NYPD wants to put up hundreds more cameras that can recognize faces and follow suspects in high-crime areas and near-potential terror targets.
[01:38:01.093 --> 01:38:05.595]  Police reportedly hope to install many of the cameras before this summer's Republican convention.
[01:38:07.396 --> 01:38:09.157]  So, there you go, my friends.
[01:38:09.197 --> 01:38:10.238]  What do you think of that?
[01:38:11.078 --> 01:38:12.458]  I'll get to some of this other news in a minute.
[01:38:12.478 --> 01:38:13.839]  Let's go through more of these calls.
[01:38:13.899 --> 01:38:14.919]  I'm going to go to you quickly.
[01:38:14.959 --> 01:38:15.640]  Bam, bam, bam!
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:18.380]  Let's talk to Ed in Texas.
[01:38:18.420 --> 01:38:19.001]  Go ahead, Ed.
[01:38:19.461 --> 01:38:20.461]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:20.481 --> 01:38:26.023]  I had a couple of points I wanted to give you about DU, but first I wanted to say I feel Marge's pain out there in Colorado.
[01:38:26.083 --> 01:38:32.185]  I can hear the hurt in her voice, but at least she is, you know, giving a little credence to the fact that maybe this is going on.
[01:38:33.525 --> 01:38:37.647]  Maybe the Army in their official report says they are raping women.
[01:38:38.147 --> 01:38:38.367]  Right.
[01:38:39.082 --> 01:38:43.964]  Pouring acid on people's genitals, raping them with giant objects.
[01:38:44.604 --> 01:38:45.905]  I can't say any more than that.
[01:38:46.045 --> 01:38:50.087]  Yeah, well, these guys all, you know, friends I know, they say, I'll never give up my guns.
[01:38:50.167 --> 01:38:58.470]  I guarantee you, when you drag somebody off by the hair of the head with a .45 in their head and tell them they'll never see their kids and their wife again, they'll give them everything in their clothes.
[01:38:58.490 --> 01:39:03.673]  Hey, let me tell you, they now admit that they bring people's children in and torture them in front of them.
[01:39:04.113 --> 01:39:04.513]  That's right.
[01:39:05.609 --> 01:39:08.211]  I've seen, personally, I've seen some of the things the cops do.
[01:39:08.231 --> 01:39:10.612]  They're just, they are criminals, you know, and I'm sick.
[01:39:11.113 --> 01:39:20.039]  I've more than once seen them where they bit off more than they could chew, and the tables got turned on them real quick, and then they're whining like a little baby, please don't hurt me, I got a family!
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:24.502]  And then, you know, one second before, they were Mr. Tough Guy, you know?
[01:39:25.482 --> 01:39:28.865]  So, look, I'm a degree, uh, health physics technician, Alex.
[01:39:29.225 --> 01:39:32.127]  Um, and, uh, glad to see you when you came down here to Houston.
[01:39:32.654 --> 01:39:35.336]  I wanted to add my two cents worth about the DU here.
[01:39:35.356 --> 01:39:39.700]  They love it because it's so dense and it's such a hard metal that, you know, anything can stop it.
[01:39:41.581 --> 01:39:45.825]  It really is not a strong radiation emitter from a gamma standpoint.
[01:39:45.845 --> 01:39:46.686]  It's actually pretty weak.
[01:39:46.706 --> 01:39:48.767]  The problem is that it's so poisonous.
[01:39:49.248 --> 01:39:51.810]  It's like cobalt, vanadium, hexavalent, and chromium.
[01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:52.831]  Well yeah, it's a heavy metal.
[01:39:52.871 --> 01:39:54.232]  It's like eating a bunch of mercury.
[01:39:54.352 --> 01:39:57.435]  Right, and I mean that is the deadliest aspect of it.
[01:39:57.475 --> 01:39:58.936]  You breathe that stuff, you know.
[01:39:58.956 --> 01:40:01.418]  Well look, we've had Dr. Rocky who's got
[01:40:02.051 --> 01:40:04.413]  You know, all these PhDs and doctorates on.
[01:40:04.453 --> 01:40:13.519]  He was the guy who literally, at Los Alamos, wrote the handbook for the Army in the mid-80s on DU, made the training video in the mid-90s on it.
[01:40:13.679 --> 01:40:14.880]  Right, I'm familiar with his work.
[01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:23.606]  Much of his crew has died that was in Iraq studying it, and now almost all the bases our troops stay in were heavily bombarded with it, and they're breathing it.
[01:40:23.726 --> 01:40:24.867]  And so what happens is,
[01:40:25.247 --> 01:40:27.389]  Well also, as it oxidizes, it becomes more toxic.
[01:40:41.690 --> 01:40:45.831]  So, I mean, the more time that goes on, like I said, from a radiation... That's it!
[01:40:45.971 --> 01:40:55.473]  The different layers of it begin to oxidize and combine with the biomass and it's very efficient.
[01:40:55.533 --> 01:40:58.853]  It's very efficient at exchanging its heavy metal ions.
[01:40:58.893 --> 01:40:59.193]  Go ahead.
[01:40:59.273 --> 01:41:05.434]  It starts creating free radicals in the tissue and it basically strips the electrons off the living tissue's atoms.
[01:41:05.854 --> 01:41:07.535]  That's what Dr. Rocky said, yeah.
[01:41:07.595 --> 01:41:08.355]  That's exactly true.
[01:41:08.835 --> 01:41:10.656]  A bunch of members of his team are dead!
[01:41:11.096 --> 01:41:12.517]  What are we going to do?
[01:41:12.537 --> 01:41:17.740]  They'll be all these articles in five years about tens of thousands of troops have died, thousands of others are sick.
[01:41:18.181 --> 01:41:20.242]  Why did they use DU?
[01:41:20.262 --> 01:41:22.863]  Oh, don't worry, we'll use it only in safe places now.
[01:41:23.564 --> 01:41:25.125]  Well, they won't let us have it, will they?
[01:41:26.625 --> 01:41:27.686]  Well, they shouldn't.
[01:41:27.746 --> 01:41:29.907]  I mean, it's depleted uranium.
[01:41:30.207 --> 01:41:30.448]  Yeah.
[01:41:30.908 --> 01:41:36.131]  A buddy of mine worked out at Long Beach at the machining facility where they literally machined it out in billets out there, you know?
[01:41:37.044 --> 01:41:45.367]  Another point I wanted to make was, you know, there's this big push for the sales-based income tax now, because everybody's wising up to the scam that's been perpetrated for all these years.
[01:41:45.387 --> 01:41:46.228]  Well, they're going to keep both.
[01:41:46.248 --> 01:41:51.590]  They're going to keep the income tax, just lower it, and give you a sales tax, and then jack both up.
[01:41:51.790 --> 01:41:56.672]  Here in Texas, we haven't had a sales tax, so they're about to start this tax of movies
[01:41:58.272 --> 01:42:05.454]  Oh yeah, down here in Houston, they want to fund the schools with the people going to adult clubs.
[01:42:05.514 --> 01:42:07.094]  But see, they're only focusing on that.
[01:42:07.134 --> 01:42:09.555]  It's thousands of businesses that are going to be taxed.
[01:42:09.575 --> 01:42:11.655]  But don't worry, we're going to lower the property tax.
[01:42:11.675 --> 01:42:15.936]  Well, they're just going to raise it again the next year, and now you'll have another tax.
[01:42:16.096 --> 01:42:17.517]  Oh, it's bait and switch all the way.
[01:42:18.037 --> 01:42:22.738]  But at one point, it just kind of sends chills up my spine as neocons push it real hard.
[01:42:22.758 --> 01:42:23.898]  You know, it's a good idea.
[01:42:23.938 --> 01:42:25.779]  Well, just remember the old Bible passage.
[01:42:26.339 --> 01:42:27.599]  So that no one rich, great,
[01:42:28.257 --> 01:42:28.758]  We're good to go.
[01:42:48.445 --> 01:42:50.025]  And you can fix the engine in my car.
[01:42:50.305 --> 01:42:53.326]  See, basically we can still barter, but that's going to eliminate that.
[01:42:53.486 --> 01:42:57.387]  Under the Patriot Act, trading is an act of terrorism.
[01:42:57.487 --> 01:42:58.327]  Oh no, man.
[01:42:58.627 --> 01:43:00.607]  How many times can you be a terrorism, Alex?
[01:43:01.567 --> 01:43:02.447]  Everything's terror.
[01:43:02.948 --> 01:43:04.028]  Oh, I know.
[01:43:04.088 --> 01:43:04.748]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:04.848 --> 01:43:05.488]  You bet.
[01:43:05.548 --> 01:43:06.508]  Steve in Pennsylvania.
[01:43:06.548 --> 01:43:07.248]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:43:08.989 --> 01:43:09.649]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:43:09.969 --> 01:43:10.629]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:43:10.749 --> 01:43:11.329]  Hello, my friend.
[01:43:11.629 --> 01:43:14.470]  I wanted to inform you, I have a catalog being sent to you.
[01:43:15.150 --> 01:43:16.970]  I've got a catalog of an ad.
[01:43:17.839 --> 01:43:23.543]  And, uh, it's for, uh, uh, amazing products and devices.
[01:43:24.344 --> 01:43:28.967]  And the things, the books that caught me in there, one of the books, there was a bunch of books that caught my attention.
[01:43:29.007 --> 01:43:30.888]  Military Mind Control from Mill Lab.
[01:43:32.309 --> 01:43:39.774]  Uh, well documented 168 page review of top secret mind control projects such as Artichoke, MKUltra, and
[01:43:41.351 --> 01:43:50.353]  Unutilized classified documents, photos, x-rays, and first-hand testimony on implants and uh... Yeah, that's the old declassified stuff.
[01:43:50.573 --> 01:43:52.734]  Is it?
[01:43:53.054 --> 01:44:01.296]  There are office buildings and bunkers full of eggheads with 170 IQs figuring out how to turn us into slobbering idiots.
[01:44:02.296 --> 01:44:03.776]  My gosh.
[01:44:04.236 --> 01:44:05.397]  There's more stuff in there.
[01:44:05.437 --> 01:44:10.378]  Anything electronic from security, surveillance, to finding our
[01:44:11.491 --> 01:44:15.114]  RF signal probes.
[01:44:15.594 --> 01:44:16.294]  It's quite weird.
[01:44:17.515 --> 01:44:18.676]  Every day we see it, sir.
[01:44:18.776 --> 01:44:19.437]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:19.457 --> 01:44:20.117]  Good to hear from you.
[01:44:20.237 --> 01:44:21.598]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:44:21.638 --> 01:44:22.419]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:44:22.879 --> 01:44:23.479]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:44:23.499 --> 01:44:24.640]  You caught me in a sneezing jag.
[01:44:25.001 --> 01:44:25.501]  Sorry about that.
[01:44:26.602 --> 01:44:27.142]  That's all right.
[01:44:29.324 --> 01:44:30.404]  This is Tim from Ohio.
[01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:31.145]  Yes, I know.
[01:44:31.165 --> 01:44:34.727]  I remember teaching research in the United States treasonous hierarchy.
[01:44:35.608 --> 01:44:37.929]  I wanted you to know I'm in honor of Kelly Rushing.
[01:44:38.430 --> 01:44:39.971]  I was coming to work the other day.
[01:44:40.783 --> 01:44:44.865]  And there was a police officer behind me that lives in the building, apartment building I live in.
[01:44:45.365 --> 01:45:00.672]  I put my hand out of the window and I actually pulled him over and I showed him some printouts from your website on the smart weapons and I explained to him that they were the next segment of the population targeted to be microchipped and he was like, hadn't even heard of that.
[01:45:01.172 --> 01:45:04.834]  Oh, that's the Associated Press, a move to make police take chips in their hands.
[01:45:05.376 --> 01:45:13.141]  And then I gave him some other things concerning the Patriot Act and Mr. Ashcroft's concentration camps and a copy of the Northwood document.
[01:45:13.602 --> 01:45:19.485]  I followed that up yesterday with an article from the, are you familiar with the investigative website, Terendipity?
[01:45:20.186 --> 01:45:20.446]  Yes.
[01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:26.430]  Very good article on there on the World Trade Center and the so-called demolition, or the so-called war on terrorism.
[01:45:27.191 --> 01:45:28.532]  And I handed that to him.
[01:45:29.252 --> 01:45:33.595]  And next will be your movie, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:45:34.754 --> 01:45:36.155]  And, uh, we'll see where we go with that.
[01:45:36.195 --> 01:45:39.717]  He's going to try to help me get in there to the City Council to talk to the police.
[01:45:39.757 --> 01:45:43.419]  We're going to bring about your, uh, Save the Bill of Rights campaign here to Ohio.
[01:45:44.199 --> 01:45:51.504]  And, um, we're going to be writing, uh, letters to all the general managers of the TV stations, challenging them for not investigating 9-11.
[01:45:52.324 --> 01:45:53.645]  And, um, one more thing.
[01:45:53.685 --> 01:46:00.889]  A friend of mine was down in Central Ohio in an old bookstore, and he got ahold of a, get this, a Masonic Bible and a code book.
[01:46:01.906 --> 01:46:06.430]  Very shortly, I want to be delving into that and I'll call you up with whatever I learn and share that with the listeners.
[01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:11.413]  And a lot of this torture stuff, when's the last time you did a story on the Tavistock Institute?
[01:46:13.015 --> 01:46:14.115]  Over in England, yes.
[01:46:14.316 --> 01:46:22.522]  Yeah, this stuff sounds like a lot of it there, but they have control, they have so many fingers and spiders out there and controlling every lot of part of our lives.
[01:46:22.942 --> 01:46:24.063]  I hear you, thanks for the call.
[01:46:24.083 --> 01:46:25.784]  Great job, Tim.
[01:46:26.405 --> 01:46:29.387]  Alley in Oklahoma, go ahead, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.301]  Good afternoon.
[01:46:33.441 --> 01:46:39.968]  I was in my car and I picked up this paid propaganda talk show host out of Oklahoma City at 1520 a.m.
[01:46:40.588 --> 01:46:41.809]  He's named Rusty something.
[01:46:42.510 --> 01:46:51.218]  Anyway, he was railing at CBS for reporting the torture of prisoners and ridicule of prisoners as if that was the crime.
[01:46:51.478 --> 01:46:53.620]  He's a horrible, fat-bellied neocon.
[01:46:54.990 --> 01:46:56.251]  And look, I've heard them all.
[01:46:56.351 --> 01:47:02.516]  I mean, I heard major talk show hosts this morning, two of them, saying, what's the big deal with this torture?
[01:47:02.756 --> 01:47:06.540]  They would read each thing the Army admits has happened and say, what's the big deal?
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:19.090]  Well, he called the man who objected to all this kind of terrible behavior on the part of the United States troops, and I'm sure it came from intelligence, as moral morons.
[01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:21.111]  The person who called in and
[01:47:22.722 --> 01:47:23.022]  That's right.
[01:47:23.062 --> 01:47:27.584]  We don't know how to see the bigger picture and be more evil than the enemy to defeat them.
[01:47:28.765 --> 01:47:33.407]  And he acted as though anyone speaking out was committing treason when he's the one committing treason.
[01:47:33.687 --> 01:47:39.409]  Well, see, that's what that whole network puts out, is that if you disagree with the government, you should be put in a forced labor camp.
[01:47:40.270 --> 01:47:42.070]  I mean, who's committing treason?
[01:47:42.691 --> 01:47:46.032]  Yeah, and it's been in everything.
[01:47:46.092 --> 01:47:50.594]  You know, the Catholic Church did it for decades, and the United Fund tried to cover up this
[01:47:50.970 --> 01:47:52.051]  We're good to go.
[01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:24.454]  And don't worry, then a Democrat's going to come into office and it's all going to be used against conservatives, and those neocons are going to be on the air claiming that the real conservative movement in America is controlled by Al-Qaeda, and they're going to be saying it's good.
[01:48:24.935 --> 01:48:29.176]  What really gets me is people are calling in and agreeing with these sick perverts.
[01:48:29.936 --> 01:48:30.236]  They are.
[01:48:30.296 --> 01:48:32.037]  They're sick perverts.
[01:48:32.077 --> 01:48:32.717]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:33.257 --> 01:48:34.558]  They really are sick perverts.
[01:48:35.318 --> 01:48:36.719]  Let's talk to John in Ohio.
[01:48:36.759 --> 01:48:37.399]  Go ahead, John.
[01:48:38.075 --> 01:48:45.421]  Yes, Alex, I'm left-leaning, I'm socialist-minded, but I've got to extend my kudos to what you're saying.
[01:48:47.502 --> 01:48:50.444]  Your precious liberal governments have killed more people than anybody else!
[01:48:51.685 --> 01:48:57.750]  Well, if you're talking about that, where there's a million people in Indonesia,
[01:48:58.266 --> 01:49:02.548]  the uh... the uh... the people that we uh... it's all around the world the death squads throughout the world.
[01:49:02.568 --> 01:49:07.830]  Well certainly the fake right wing does it, the fake left wing does it, you're all control but go ahead and say what you're going to say.
[01:49:08.231 --> 01:49:26.319]  What I wanted to say is I'm going to give you a donation despite our disagreements on some issues because uh... this is incredible uh... uh... Claire Channel you know the chairman of that uh... that that uh... propaganda sewer is uh... is a close associate business partner with George Bush has given hundreds of thousands of dollars to him and the Republican Party
[01:49:26.835 --> 01:49:34.340]  As I've told all of it, it's a fake... Well, that sewer owns a big voting machine company!
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:35.661]  It does that, too.
[01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:49.430]  And now they're trying to make us as corrupt as the cynical psychopaths in the top elements of the elite in this country, in the military-industrial complex, by this constant programming, that in the future they hope they won't even have to peddle this
[01:49:50.071 --> 01:49:53.774]  This drivel about bringing democracy and liberation to these countries.
[01:49:54.175 --> 01:49:58.138]  I hear the neocons every day say, it is about oil, so what?
[01:49:58.198 --> 01:49:58.738]  We need it.
[01:49:58.858 --> 01:49:59.379]  Shut up.
[01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:00.740]  Exactly.
[01:50:00.800 --> 01:50:03.282]  Now, they hold two things in their mind.
[01:50:03.402 --> 01:50:07.906]  First, they say, it didn't happen, it couldn't happen, we would never do that when it's proved that it's happened.
[01:50:07.946 --> 01:50:09.427]  Well, it's a great thing.
[01:50:09.467 --> 01:50:10.508]  What's the matter with you?
[01:50:10.728 --> 01:50:13.671]  And they still say that we found weapons of mass destruction.
[01:50:14.301 --> 01:50:24.043]  Yes, and they're trying to make us, through all of the programs you're talking about, be every bit as homocytical and sociopathic as they are by telling us that this is okay.
[01:50:24.383 --> 01:50:33.065]  If they can do that, they won't have to peddle this drivel about... So they are openly reading off the list and saying raping women is no big deal?
[01:50:33.525 --> 01:50:37.966]  Yes, and... Raping women is no big deal?
[01:50:38.590 --> 01:50:40.771]  Putting Americans in camps is good.
[01:50:41.531 --> 01:50:42.291]  You're pulling it out.
[01:50:42.311 --> 01:50:43.351]  They're breaking new grounds.
[01:50:43.451 --> 01:50:46.492]  Even the Nazis had enough decency to try to hide this stuff.
[01:50:47.112 --> 01:50:49.653]  If you read Ordinary American... That's it.
[01:50:49.673 --> 01:50:51.214]  Hey, thanks for the support, John.
[01:50:51.254 --> 01:50:51.914]  Take care.
[01:50:51.954 --> 01:50:52.734]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:54.214 --> 01:50:58.556]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:58.736 --> 01:51:03.097]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:51:05.613 --> 01:51:07.876]  The New World Order can emerge.
[01:51:07.936 --> 01:51:09.137]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:51:24.454 --> 01:51:34.998]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:51:35.218 --> 01:51:40.580]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.721]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:51:57.651 --> 01:52:06.483]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:52:06.803 --> 01:52:11.490]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:18.673]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:52:19.073 --> 01:52:30.858]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:52:31.318 --> 01:52:35.781]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:53:53.985 --> 01:53:57.847]  I'll tell you what, the next hour
[01:54:07.763 --> 01:54:12.567]  I'm going to read back over briefly the Army's own report that came out today.
[01:54:13.728 --> 01:54:25.078]  The 800th MP Brigade by their top general admitting the raping of women, pouring battery acid on people, threatening to kill their children.
[01:54:25.199 --> 01:54:27.000]  I mean, just everything you can imagine.
[01:54:29.002 --> 01:54:32.725]  And yes, the neocons actually on the radio saying it's good.
[01:54:33.786 --> 01:54:34.687]  That it's no big deal.
[01:54:36.741 --> 01:54:40.744]  I mean, the Nazis didn't do that.
[01:54:40.804 --> 01:54:42.185]  This is new ground, folks.
[01:54:42.405 --> 01:54:43.966]  New ground.
[01:54:43.986 --> 01:54:48.789]  Before we go to John and Lee and others, first off, a toll-free number to join us.
[01:54:48.809 --> 01:54:51.211]  We're just going to continue with wide-open phones and other news reports.
[01:54:51.231 --> 01:54:51.932]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:51.952 --> 01:54:52.052]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:54:52.072 --> 01:54:52.692]  And remember, I've made
[01:55:05.808 --> 01:55:12.152]  Ten videos, I carry three or four other, no I guess five or six other videos by other great researchers and authors.
[01:55:12.633 --> 01:55:16.115]  A bunch of other wonderful books, books on tape, you name it.
[01:55:16.695 --> 01:55:27.963]  Go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com where you can peruse our online secure safe shopping cart, where you can watch video clips of the films.
[01:55:29.551 --> 01:55:32.475]  And order some of the videos, because we do need your support.
[01:55:32.515 --> 01:55:35.059]  We can hire more people, do a better job if we get your support.
[01:55:35.079 --> 01:55:35.860]  If we don't, we can't.
[01:55:36.881 --> 01:55:38.303]  Plus, these are just incredible films.
[01:55:38.403 --> 01:55:42.329]  And my videos, you're authorized to make copies of for non-profit.
[01:55:43.318 --> 01:55:48.162]  educational purposes, to air them on AXS TV, to force multiply this information.
[01:55:48.482 --> 01:55:52.945]  Good people aren't going to buy this unless we just let the globalists condition us to accept it.
[01:55:53.225 --> 01:55:59.569]  We gotta stand up and say no slavery's wrong, no torture's wrong, no raping women is wrong.
[01:56:00.170 --> 01:56:05.013]  I know we're radical and you know very extremist because we're against rape now.
[01:56:05.033 --> 01:56:06.394]  I mean that's how sick things have gotten.
[01:56:07.475 --> 01:56:12.178]  But we're still going to be against rape even if it means we get arrested for being against the officials raping us.
[01:56:13.007 --> 01:56:14.428]  I'm not even being sarcastic now.
[01:56:14.768 --> 01:56:15.628]  This is what it's come to.
[01:56:16.348 --> 01:56:18.349]  My films are $25.95 apiece.
[01:56:18.429 --> 01:56:20.150]  Twenty bucks when you order three or more.
[01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:23.611]  Please call and get my videos.
[01:56:23.631 --> 01:56:24.811]  Get the other books and tapes.
[01:56:24.911 --> 01:56:31.854]  Get The Innocence Portrayed by Jews and the Preservation of Firearms that exposes how after they take your guns they rape and kill you.
[01:56:31.874 --> 01:56:33.835]  It's an incredible film.
[01:56:34.215 --> 01:56:39.637]  Get three free comic books about the Second Amendment for young people when you buy the video on VHS or DVD.
[01:56:40.589 --> 01:56:41.089]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:56:41.129 --> 01:56:41.530]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:56:41.590 --> 01:56:47.274]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:56:48.055 --> 01:56:50.016]  Let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:56:50.056 --> 01:56:51.898]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:57:07.967 --> 01:57:10.329]  I guess up next is it John in Texas?
[01:57:10.389 --> 01:57:11.190]  John, go ahead.
[01:57:11.210 --> 01:57:12.531]  Hello?
[01:57:12.811 --> 01:57:13.112]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:13.672 --> 01:57:13.953]  Oh, okay.
[01:57:13.993 --> 01:57:15.394]  I couldn't tell that you'd come to me.
[01:57:15.454 --> 01:57:15.854]  That's okay.
[01:57:15.874 --> 01:57:16.195]  Go ahead.
[01:57:17.079 --> 01:57:20.000]  Could you spell the name of the general who resigned down in Guantanamo?
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:21.821]  I've heard you name him a couple of times.
[01:57:22.121 --> 01:57:25.683]  He's in Police State 3 Title of Enslavement, the Associated Press articles.
[01:57:26.403 --> 01:57:29.285]  But it's General Rick Baucus.
[01:57:29.505 --> 01:57:33.487]  I don't want to tell you the spelling because I might get it wrong, but it's just Baucus.
[01:57:33.907 --> 01:57:36.848]  Okay, I guess it's like B-A-U-C-H-U-S or something like that.
[01:57:36.868 --> 01:57:37.528]  I believe so, yes.
[01:57:38.049 --> 01:57:40.010]  Brigadier General Rick Baucus.
[01:57:40.390 --> 01:57:40.730]  Okay.
[01:57:41.502 --> 01:57:43.984]  And he was disgusted by it and resigned from it.
[01:57:44.144 --> 01:57:47.105]  And then they said, no, we fired him, but then they had to admit that he resigned.
[01:57:47.286 --> 01:57:49.287]  Well, he has to be transferred.
[01:57:49.647 --> 01:57:51.468]  And then they said, I'm going to resign.
[01:57:51.508 --> 01:57:52.509]  They said, good, resign.
[01:57:52.609 --> 01:57:53.809]  They always spin it, don't they?
[01:57:54.210 --> 01:57:56.131]  Well, I've tried to get you on here in Dallas.
[01:57:56.171 --> 01:58:00.714]  They've got several locals here competing for the same perspective, you know.
[01:58:01.094 --> 01:58:03.836]  I've tried to get a fresh perspective in here, but they just won't allow it.
[01:58:03.856 --> 01:58:05.156]  They're kind of locked out of it.
[01:58:05.176 --> 01:58:09.659]  So is my hometown, Dallas, Big D, are they on the radio saying torture's great there?
[01:58:10.239 --> 01:58:10.980]  Essentially, yes.
[01:58:11.887 --> 01:58:14.048]  They're complimentary.
[01:58:14.308 --> 01:58:18.229]  You know, they always couch it in the terms they support the troops, etc, etc.
[01:58:18.749 --> 01:58:20.889]  But it's really disgusting, and I don't like it at all.
[01:58:21.329 --> 01:58:23.330]  Oh, I'm hearing them say that it's no big deal.
[01:58:23.610 --> 01:58:24.210]  Oh, that's right.
[01:58:24.690 --> 01:58:32.012]  One of the local guys says that, tries to explain it away, you know, and why were the guys detained in the first place, and this, that, and the other, and humiliated.
[01:58:32.032 --> 01:58:33.112]  Yeah, they deserve it.
[01:58:33.192 --> 01:58:36.533]  See, if you're a suspect, you deserve to be raped.
[01:58:36.953 --> 01:58:37.773]  I had one other thing.
[01:58:38.013 --> 01:58:38.754]  Okay, stay there.
[01:58:38.814 --> 01:58:39.774]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:39.814 --> 01:58:40.634]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:58:44.565 --> 01:58:52.467]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[01:58:52.787 --> 01:58:58.069]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[01:58:58.249 --> 01:59:00.830]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:06.011]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own election?
[01:59:06.611 --> 01:59:09.092]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[01:59:33.201 --> 01:59:33.682]  Big Brother.
[01:59:33.742 --> 01:59:34.322]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:53.562 --> 01:59:54.683]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:55.343 --> 01:59:56.183]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.904 --> 01:59:57.824]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:58.465 --> 02:00:02.127]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.647 --> 02:00:06.789]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.871 --> 02:00:16.834]  Alright, hour number three, massive news blitzes continuing with masses of your phone calls at 800-259-9231.
[02:00:16.874 --> 02:00:19.716]  Got a phone line open for the first time in the show.
[02:00:23.183 --> 02:00:23.523]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:23.623 --> 02:00:36.631]  I want to get back into the Army's own admitted report, where they admit raping, torture, battery acid, just stuff I can't even mention on air.
[02:00:36.731 --> 02:00:42.535]  Meanwhile, the neocons are out trying to lie, either saying it isn't true, or saying it's good!
[02:00:42.555 --> 02:00:47.118]  I heard two national talk shows today say it's no big deal, ha ha ha,
[02:00:48.093 --> 02:00:51.897]  And the callers are calling and reporting that the locals are all copying their masters.
[02:00:52.417 --> 02:00:54.720]  The Nazis didn't brag about torture.
[02:00:55.180 --> 02:00:58.183]  We've broken new ground here with these sickos.
[02:00:58.323 --> 02:01:00.205]  And it's energizing the fake left wing.
[02:01:00.545 --> 02:01:03.368]  They see this and then it's energizing the left wing.
[02:01:04.489 --> 02:01:06.010]  And the New World Order controls all this.
[02:01:06.551 --> 02:01:09.954]  And conservatism in America is being discredited and that was the plan to begin with.
[02:01:12.687 --> 02:01:16.450]  This has been out for over a year and now they're just telling you about it because the U.N.
[02:01:16.511 --> 02:01:19.033]  handover is about to happen and they want to demonize America.
[02:01:20.814 --> 02:01:22.776]  Okay, I said loaded phones.
[02:01:22.816 --> 02:01:24.677]  We're going to continue with your calls here.
[02:01:25.858 --> 02:01:29.321]  We were going to let, I believe it's John in Texas finish up.
[02:01:29.361 --> 02:01:29.902]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:01:30.202 --> 02:01:31.603]  Yeah, well one other little thing.
[02:01:31.983 --> 02:01:34.445]  They are giving the real conservatives bad names.
[02:01:34.605 --> 02:01:38.489]  I mean, they're muddying the water for everybody that's really sincere about their beliefs.
[02:01:38.989 --> 02:01:41.191]  Anyway, I wanted to say that I've always thought that the
[02:01:41.798 --> 02:01:48.515]  Social Security System is what was really meant by the 666 in the Bible because you have to have that number to transact any kind of business.
[02:01:49.082 --> 02:01:52.826]  And they track you with it, etc, etc, and to me that's what that 666 is.
[02:01:53.326 --> 02:01:56.489]  And it becomes the mark of the beast when you have to have it at the store.
[02:01:57.030 --> 02:02:02.375]  The face scanning camera says you haven't paid a ticket, so the store clerk says, sorry, we can't sell you food.
[02:02:02.816 --> 02:02:04.638]  That's the official government statement.
[02:02:04.978 --> 02:02:07.220]  Now you can't fly if you haven't paid tickets.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:09.442]  If you have bad credit, they're arresting you.
[02:02:09.623 --> 02:02:11.825]  This has been in the news in the last seven days.
[02:02:12.529 --> 02:02:12.989]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:02:13.009 --> 02:02:13.549]  God bless you.
[02:02:14.050 --> 02:02:15.070]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:15.110 --> 02:02:15.890]  Good to hear from you.
[02:02:16.691 --> 02:02:20.412]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lee in Colorado.
[02:02:20.472 --> 02:02:21.172]  Lee, go ahead.
[02:02:21.913 --> 02:02:31.396]  Yeah, Alex, I was watching TV the other night, and to my surprise, there was a little 87-minute movie on called Strip Search.
[02:02:31.476 --> 02:02:32.457]  Are you familiar with that?
[02:02:32.937 --> 02:02:33.117]  No.
[02:02:33.997 --> 02:02:38.459]  The only actor that I could see that I recognized was Glenn Close.
[02:02:39.859 --> 02:02:41.480]  It was unbelievable.
[02:02:41.541 --> 02:02:45.003]  It follows right along with the stuff that's in your videos.
[02:02:45.864 --> 02:02:49.347]  And I was thinking about sending you a copy of it, but I copied it.
[02:02:50.347 --> 02:02:52.289]  Was the show saying it was all good?
[02:02:52.689 --> 02:02:54.891]  No, I just couldn't believe it.
[02:02:55.491 --> 02:03:02.317]  It was even on TV because it showed him interrogating an Arab guy from New York City.
[02:03:02.782 --> 02:03:13.466]  They drug him off with a hood over his head, and then it would switch back and forth to a girl that was in China or somewhere, and they did the same thing, and they were asking the same questions almost to him.
[02:03:13.526 --> 02:03:14.327]  It was just unbelievable.
[02:03:14.367 --> 02:03:15.187]  Well, that's the point.
[02:03:15.267 --> 02:03:16.788]  China's been doing this for a long time.
[02:03:16.808 --> 02:03:18.949]  And then they say, oh, it's to stop the terrorists.
[02:03:19.369 --> 02:03:21.230]  Our government carried these attacks out.
[02:03:21.610 --> 02:03:23.390]  Taliban and Al-Qaeda works for them.
[02:03:23.751 --> 02:03:24.891]  They protected the bin Ladins.
[02:03:24.911 --> 02:03:25.851]  They're in business with them.
[02:03:26.072 --> 02:03:26.992]  This is all admitted.
[02:03:27.132 --> 02:03:27.772]  Right, right.
[02:03:28.473 --> 02:03:29.513]  And in the movie,
[02:03:30.281 --> 02:03:38.584]  They asked, I just couldn't get over it because they asked the questions, the very things that are in your videos.
[02:03:39.204 --> 02:03:43.466]  And the guy says, what about my rights?
[02:03:44.666 --> 02:03:48.868]  How come I can't confront my accusers?
[02:03:49.308 --> 02:03:51.569]  How come I don't get legal services?
[02:03:52.029 --> 02:03:53.249]  How long can you hold me?
[02:03:53.269 --> 02:03:57.571]  And they're just sitting there right there saying, we can hold you as long as it takes.
[02:03:58.087 --> 02:04:09.075]  Well, the reason it's the same thing in my videos is because that's what we videotaped the troops trying to do before 9-11, and the Colonel, Colonel Love, says, the terrorists are about to attack, and we're going to do this when it happens.
[02:04:09.575 --> 02:04:13.638]  Yeah, the thing that caught me off guard was, why is that even on TV?
[02:04:14.039 --> 02:04:20.884]  And then it just kind of hit me like you talk about incrementalism, and putting it in front of us a little bit at a time to get us used to that stuff.
[02:04:21.824 --> 02:04:22.805]  I'll send you a copy of it.
[02:04:23.265 --> 02:04:24.426]  Alright, please do that.
[02:04:24.526 --> 02:04:25.227]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:26.622 --> 02:04:28.064]  Strict Search with Glenn Close.
[02:04:28.144 --> 02:04:28.384]  Okay.
[02:04:28.404 --> 02:04:35.031]  Alright, we'll come back and continue with your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:35.051 --> 02:04:37.833]  Go into your calls quickly.
[02:04:38.394 --> 02:04:43.299]  What have you heard your local neocon ultra-socialist saying on the radio about torture?
[02:04:46.650 --> 02:04:47.650]  It's finally here!
[02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:48.751]  Spring has arrived!
[02:04:48.951 --> 02:04:51.911]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:52.131 --> 02:04:55.592]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:55.792 --> 02:05:03.934]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:05:04.214 --> 02:05:07.935]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.

[02:05:46.005 --> 02:05:50.347]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:05:50.527 --> 02:05:54.949]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:55.109 --> 02:05:55.929]  There is a chance
[02:05:56.877 --> 02:05:59.479]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:05:59.519 --> 02:06:02.340]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:06:02.641 --> 02:06:06.863]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:06:06.943 --> 02:06:13.868]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:06:13.988 --> 02:06:15.989]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:26.793]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:06:26.993 --> 02:06:32.355]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:06:45.499 --> 02:06:54.125]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:06:54.345 --> 02:07:05.633]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:07:05.833 --> 02:07:08.455]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:07:08.815 --> 02:07:15.280]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:17.301]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:07:17.521 --> 02:07:23.546]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:07:23.786 --> 02:07:29.450]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:07:34.451 --> 02:07:35.151]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:07:35.171 --> 02:07:36.152]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:07:36.512 --> 02:07:38.232]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:09.221 --> 02:08:31.097]  About once a week, I get on this radio show and I talk about the different national talk show hosts, and it's a bunch of them now, saying that if you disagree with the government, that somehow aids the terrorists, and you should be arrested, and we can't have these lazy, you know, traitors, us paying for them, we need to make them work!
[02:08:31.238 --> 02:08:32.358]  Force labor camps!
[02:08:32.378 --> 02:08:34.300]  Let me say it again.
[02:08:34.904 --> 02:08:39.325]  That isn't on the air on thousands of radio stations for nothing.
[02:08:39.345 --> 02:08:48.588]  You know, this network has to fight and claw and do everything you can imagine to be on, you know, a couple hundred stations with all the shows combined.
[02:08:50.769 --> 02:08:56.251]  That garbage is all over the radio, all over TV to warp and condition the minds of the people.
[02:08:59.213 --> 02:09:01.958]  And I would never be part of promoting something like that.
[02:09:01.978 --> 02:09:06.004]  In fact, I will actively stand up and fight against it because they are the traitors.
[02:09:06.024 --> 02:09:13.537]  I mean, they have destroyed their family names, everything that this country ever stood for.
[02:09:14.975 --> 02:09:19.078]  But America has to be destroyed, and this is all part of that process.
[02:09:19.178 --> 02:09:26.383]  America being used to secure the control of the resources for the big banks that control the U.N.
[02:09:26.403 --> 02:09:29.265]  and our government, and then they will be put up as the saviors.
[02:09:30.366 --> 02:09:31.787]  That's all that's going on here.
[02:09:31.907 --> 02:09:35.269]  It's very sophisticated, and this is their program.
[02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:36.510]  Alright, let's do this.
[02:09:36.530 --> 02:09:40.193]  Let's take five more calls, and I'll go back in the news, and five more calls, and back in the news.
[02:09:41.134 --> 02:09:45.297]  Let's go ahead and talk to Maureen in Virginia.
[02:09:45.317 --> 02:09:45.857]  Go ahead.
[02:09:46.258 --> 02:10:00.827]  Hey Alex, I want to preface what I'm going to say with, I remember 15 years ago reading about how the Americans were going to be made to hate their government so that they would be willing to change over their form of government.
[02:10:01.168 --> 02:10:04.330]  And I'd say they are about there because I kind of hate it too.
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:07.843]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:10:08.143 --> 02:10:22.863]  They covertly changed us in 1913 with the Federal Reserve, 1930 with the War Powers Act, 1947 with the National Security Act, 2001 with the Patriot Act, 2002 Homeland Security, fully to a military-industrial complex
[02:10:23.503 --> 02:10:32.708]  A dictatorship with the illusion of voting, with the CIA now running most of the voting, no more voting, and then they blame the Constitution and say, oh, America's bad.
[02:10:33.088 --> 02:10:38.710]  We've been taken over by the New World Order, but on the surface they're putting the red, white, and blue on it to fool people.
[02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:40.391]  That makes sense.
[02:10:40.511 --> 02:10:44.553]  Hey, I put up a website that I'd appreciate it if I could have people go to.
[02:10:45.033 --> 02:10:48.875]  It's basically an attempt to stop the draft.
[02:10:49.496 --> 02:10:50.336]  It's called Drafted.
[02:10:50.436 --> 02:10:51.356]  It's www.drafted.org.
[02:10:52.822 --> 02:10:57.184]  IntoSlavery.com Well, that's a great web address.
[02:10:57.604 --> 02:11:11.151]  Do you have people that tell you it's still a rumor after the draft boards have been set back up, getting ready for selective service for women, twelve different draft pieces of legislation for conscription, and still the yuppies laugh and say it doesn't exist?
[02:11:11.731 --> 02:11:16.013]  Nobody can tell me that because I don't know what I'm doing on a website, so nobody will be able to contact me.
[02:11:16.193 --> 02:11:16.854]  No problem.
[02:11:17.974 --> 02:11:21.496]  It basically gives people information about, call your congress,
[02:11:22.014 --> 02:11:22.674]  Constantly.
[02:11:22.814 --> 02:11:23.374]  Every day.
[02:11:23.414 --> 02:11:24.034]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:11:24.054 --> 02:11:28.055]  They're going to vaporize and study or release smallpox and say, we've got to do it.
[02:11:28.095 --> 02:11:30.036]  Now shut up and stop criticizing us.
[02:11:30.496 --> 02:11:32.256]  We're arresting those that criticize us.
[02:11:32.336 --> 02:11:33.556]  It's for the homeland.
[02:11:34.097 --> 02:11:38.538]  All we can do is expose who they are and what they're doing and how they are behind the terror.
[02:11:38.858 --> 02:11:40.738]  That's how we save lives and save this country.
[02:11:41.138 --> 02:11:42.858]  Your Matrix of Evil video?
[02:11:42.878 --> 02:11:44.379]  That is awesome.
[02:11:44.519 --> 02:11:49.860]  I mean, I've got many of them, but the 9-1-1 and the Matrix of Evil so far, they're my favorites.
[02:11:50.746 --> 02:11:52.548]  Really good ones to give out to police.
[02:11:53.729 --> 02:11:56.111]  So what response have you gotten from police that have seen it?
[02:11:57.052 --> 02:11:59.234]  Um, actually I gave one to a mayor.
[02:11:59.774 --> 02:12:02.717]  And then I've given the same ones to some police in his city.
[02:12:03.137 --> 02:12:06.420]  And I told the mayor that the police had it, the police that the mayor had it.
[02:12:06.700 --> 02:12:11.164]  And so they're all watching them before the other one contacts them to see what they think about them.
[02:12:11.644 --> 02:12:13.466]  But I haven't gotten any feedback.
[02:12:13.766 --> 02:12:15.648]  Well actually the mayor had watched two of them.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.662]  And so had the one cop that I gave it to.
[02:12:18.962 --> 02:12:21.204]  I mean, if they've watched, too, that's a real good sign.
[02:12:21.685 --> 02:12:22.125]  That is.
[02:12:22.165 --> 02:12:22.766]  God bless you.
[02:12:22.786 --> 02:12:23.306]  Keep it up.
[02:12:23.507 --> 02:12:23.967]  Thank you.
[02:12:24.147 --> 02:12:24.808]  You bet.
[02:12:24.868 --> 02:12:25.969]  Danny in Tennessee.
[02:12:26.029 --> 02:12:26.930]  Danny, go ahead.
[02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:28.211]  Hey, Alex.
[02:12:28.751 --> 02:12:29.352]  Hello, Danny.
[02:12:30.713 --> 02:12:37.079]  First of all, I got a little bit of news for you, but I just wanted to let you know I signed up for Prison Planet TV a couple weeks ago.
[02:12:37.740 --> 02:12:38.080]  Awesome.
[02:12:38.180 --> 02:12:38.620]  I love it.
[02:12:38.701 --> 02:12:39.081]  Thank you.
[02:12:40.382 --> 02:12:40.722]  Great.
[02:12:40.843 --> 02:12:43.345]  Thank you, because we need the support to pay for the bandwidth.
[02:12:43.626 --> 02:12:44.927]  Well, I was wanting to ask you.
[02:12:45.508 --> 02:12:48.331]  I've got a restaurant down in Tennessee, and I've got several TVs.
[02:12:48.992 --> 02:12:51.274]  And I was going to put in a high-speed internet connection.
[02:12:51.695 --> 02:12:53.056]  Yes, you're welcome to stream it.
[02:12:54.282 --> 02:12:57.723]  In your restaurant, in your church, wherever.
[02:12:58.023 --> 02:12:58.623]  Okay, good.
[02:12:58.663 --> 02:13:02.625]  I just didn't want to, you know, be robbing your... No, that way you'll get the TV show every week.
[02:13:02.645 --> 02:13:04.205]  You'll get the special text reports.
[02:13:04.565 --> 02:13:06.586]  Yeah, I love the weekly TV show.
[02:13:06.606 --> 02:13:07.526]  That's my favorite part.
[02:13:07.806 --> 02:13:10.547]  Well, we're going to upload two of them this week.
[02:13:10.587 --> 02:13:11.868]  Most weeks you just get an hour.
[02:13:12.328 --> 02:13:21.231]  This week you got an hour and 20 minutes, but I'm going to put two more 145-minute and 150-minute TV shows that I just did up there in the next few days.
[02:13:21.571 --> 02:13:21.971]  Great.
[02:13:22.191 --> 02:13:22.451]  Awesome.
[02:13:23.118 --> 02:13:28.804]  And I also wanted to let you know, I don't know if you remember, but I'm disabled and I can't hardly walk.
[02:13:29.545 --> 02:13:32.948]  I spend about 10 hours a day researching the New World Order and stuff on the internet.
[02:13:33.849 --> 02:13:39.014]  And I found about 100 different conditioning articles about Dukes being set off city.
[02:13:39.875 --> 02:13:44.180]  And it seems to me like the articles are pointing towards it being blamed on Iran.
[02:13:45.234 --> 02:13:47.175]  And I was going to send all of them to you.
[02:13:47.215 --> 02:13:48.955]  No, that's fine.
[02:13:49.275 --> 02:13:51.856]  Probably some I haven't seen, but I've seen most of them.
[02:13:52.176 --> 02:14:02.399]  Yeah, they're going to nuke a city, or dirty bomb a city, or at least smallpox, and then the jig is up, the balloon is gone up, and it's total martial law for your safety.
[02:14:02.659 --> 02:14:04.700]  Did you watch the 10.5 miniseries on TV?
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:04.780]  No.
[02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:10.250]  I taped it.
[02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:11.551]  I'll have to send you a copy of it.
[02:14:11.611 --> 02:14:14.413]  I'm sure it's all how martial law is good for your safety.
[02:14:14.673 --> 02:14:14.793]  Yeah.
[02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:15.714]  FEMA is our savior.
[02:14:15.814 --> 02:14:18.495]  Martial law saves the people.
[02:14:19.436 --> 02:14:22.998]  The head of GAF, FEMA, sacrifices himself to save the people.
[02:14:23.018 --> 02:14:27.381]  It's just an amazing conditioning thing and I've always thought that they were going to
[02:14:28.737 --> 02:14:30.239]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:14:30.419 --> 02:14:31.220]  I just had two comments.
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:32.321]  One about the VX
[02:14:47.970 --> 02:14:49.911]  Dumping that they're preparing to do in the river over here?
[02:14:50.411 --> 02:14:59.393]  Yes, they're going to, thousands and thousands of tons diluted with five million gallons of water, dumping VX in the Delaware River.
[02:14:59.734 --> 02:15:07.116]  Exactly, and I did some research, and actually, the diluted substance is extremely dangerous still.
[02:15:07.156 --> 02:15:10.237]  It has three extreme neurotoxins.
[02:15:10.337 --> 02:15:11.377]  Well, that's the craziness.
[02:15:11.397 --> 02:15:13.998]  They put sodium fluoride in the water,
[02:15:14.887 --> 02:15:19.811]  They put DU in the munitions, and now in concrete mix at the store.
[02:15:20.992 --> 02:15:29.240]  They take their toxic waste and say it's good, and dump it in the water, and then if they catch you dumping motor oil in the gutter, you're going to get five years in prison!
[02:15:29.500 --> 02:15:32.563]  Exactly, and one of these things is called EA-2192.
[02:15:34.424 --> 02:15:37.907]  And according to the Army's own documents, that's just the X.
[02:15:39.409 --> 02:15:40.170]  In a lesser form.
[02:15:40.370 --> 02:15:40.990]  Well, you know what?
[02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:46.575]  Are you working with Al-Qaeda because Al-Qaeda doesn't, you know, talks about not dumping VX in the water?
[02:15:46.975 --> 02:15:47.315]  I don't know.
[02:15:47.335 --> 02:15:51.118]  I'm also against the race, so I guess I must be a secret operative.
[02:15:52.239 --> 02:15:52.779]  Exactly.
[02:15:52.799 --> 02:15:57.323]  If you're against wiping these Iraqi women in the prison, as the Armour Report admits, you're not a good American.
[02:15:57.503 --> 02:15:59.825]  Yeah, that was the other point I just wanted to touch on.
[02:15:59.865 --> 02:16:06.850]  WorldNetDaily had a sort of a shill article on that saying, well, some of the pictures might not be true, so
[02:16:07.695 --> 02:16:09.196]  Uh, it's just our propaganda.
[02:16:09.576 --> 02:16:20.359]  Like what you're saying, there's truly... And I said last week, if you heard Friday's show, they're gonna put out fake news reports to then discredit all of them when the army admits it and the people have confessed.
[02:16:20.660 --> 02:16:30.883]  Yeah, the fact, and actually what's interesting is the website that was, uh, a quote, legitimate porn site, which looked a lot like a snuff, uh, film area, uh, has disappeared, uh, in the past day.
[02:16:31.603 --> 02:16:36.165]  So I, I don't know what that's about, but, uh, the bottom line is it's a fake debate, uh, because
[02:16:36.584 --> 02:16:39.847]  Their own documents now admit to rape.
[02:16:40.688 --> 02:16:41.668]  I just don't know.
[02:16:42.749 --> 02:16:43.190]  I hear you.
[02:16:43.210 --> 02:16:43.910]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:43.950 --> 02:16:45.071]  That's how they do it.
[02:16:45.131 --> 02:16:50.916]  Look, it's like the book, Fortunate Son, when they killed the writer that wrote that about Bosch and his cocaine use.
[02:16:51.797 --> 02:16:57.042]  They found one thing out of a huge 300 page book that wasn't exactly accurate.
[02:16:57.882 --> 02:17:01.846]  And then the media focused on that and then ignored all the other admitted stuff.
[02:17:02.586 --> 02:17:03.287]  That's how they do it.
[02:17:03.934 --> 02:17:07.717]  And a lot of times they'll put out the piece of disinfo, that's why we didn't post those.
[02:17:08.718 --> 02:17:14.643]  But the Army, I'm going to read that, come up in a few minutes, I've got a document on that, the Army's own document admitting it.
[02:17:15.503 --> 02:17:17.405]  Let's talk to Darren in California.
[02:17:17.465 --> 02:17:18.265]  Darren, go ahead.
[02:17:18.285 --> 02:17:26.512]  Hey Alex, calling in response to some comments that you made the other day on your broadcast about Amy Goodman and Democracy Now!
[02:17:27.392 --> 02:17:34.255]  Well, yeah, they put out a lot of good information, but then they said the solution is the UN and world government, so it's part of a controlled paradigm.
[02:17:34.975 --> 02:17:46.200]  Yeah, you know, and I think they're a fantastic broadcast, and I hear you, but I don't think we're all going to agree 100% as far as... Well, sir, the UN is... Look, the same people that run America run the UN.
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:49.221]  And they con you in this false left-right system.
[02:17:50.642 --> 02:17:55.224]  Alright, but, well, for example, I don't agree with abortion.
[02:17:56.096 --> 02:17:57.398]  And I'm for gun control.
[02:17:57.478 --> 02:17:59.400]  I mean, I'm not for gun control.
[02:17:59.801 --> 02:18:02.323]  But at the same time, they allow those voices to be heard.
[02:18:03.325 --> 02:18:11.774]  And I think their broadcast... In other words, it would be better if more people... Can you imagine if Amy Goodman replaced Scarborough, for example?
[02:18:12.135 --> 02:18:13.356]  You'd think we'd be all better off.
[02:18:14.818 --> 02:18:15.558]  Scarborough country.
[02:18:15.718 --> 02:18:22.941]  I think short term, but that would only demonize one layer of the onion instead of going to the heart of the matter.
[02:18:23.402 --> 02:18:31.145]  Look, I have globalist white papers where they talk about, okay, there's a world government, we can't deny it anymore, we'll give them a choice between left-wing and right-wing world government.
[02:18:31.365 --> 02:18:32.446]  That's no choice at all.
[02:18:33.286 --> 02:18:33.486]  Okay.
[02:18:34.566 --> 02:18:38.128]  So what I'm telling you is, is that Amy Goodman only tells you part of the story.
[02:18:38.894 --> 02:18:41.796]  Okay, well how about, let's take an example like Michael Moore.
[02:18:42.097 --> 02:18:45.800]  He's, right now, he's working on a 9-11 cover-up documentary.
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:52.365]  Well, really, I've talked to those that have been involved, and he's only focusing on Bush and the Bin Ladens, not saying they were behind it.
[02:18:52.826 --> 02:18:56.689]  But even the whitewash film, Disney, is now blocking its release.
[02:18:57.289 --> 02:18:58.570]  Yeah, I heard about that.
[02:18:59.191 --> 02:19:03.014]  Well, he might not get all the facts straight, but can you imagine the public interest it might create?
[02:19:03.638 --> 02:19:07.179]  Hold on, he doesn't not get the facts straight.
[02:19:07.759 --> 02:19:09.879]  He only says it's a small group doing it.
[02:19:09.979 --> 02:19:11.219]  Oh, it's the right-wingers.
[02:19:11.680 --> 02:19:15.240]  He doesn't talk about Bill Clinton protecting Al-Qaeda.
[02:19:16.100 --> 02:19:23.862]  You think people might get interested in the subject, that they end up online researching it, and eventually they end up at Infowars.com?
[02:19:24.002 --> 02:19:28.483]  Obviously the film is going to be overall a good work, because Disney's blocking its release.
[02:19:28.923 --> 02:19:30.443]  Yeah, I hear you.
[02:19:31.287 --> 02:19:37.735]  I guess I just, you know, if we don't 100% agree with all these independent media, I just think we should... Well, hold on a minute.
[02:19:38.515 --> 02:19:40.878]  If I don't agree with them, I'm going to tell you what I disagree with them about.
[02:19:41.439 --> 02:19:42.039]  Okay, I hear you.
[02:19:42.079 --> 02:19:42.920]  See, that's all we're doing.
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:43.381]  Thanks for the call.
[02:19:46.209 --> 02:19:46.990]  Terrorism!
[02:19:47.130 --> 02:19:47.871]  Terrorism!
[02:19:47.971 --> 02:19:54.057]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:19:54.297 --> 02:19:55.899]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:19:56.139 --> 02:19:58.622]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:19:59.002 --> 02:20:05.589]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[02:20:05.589 --> 02:20:13.557]  Jane LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:13.597 --> 02:20:13.918]  government.
[02:20:14.098 --> 02:20:15.920]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:22.206]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:22.346 --> 02:20:26.791]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[02:20:45.777 --> 02:20:49.358]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[02:20:49.618 --> 02:20:51.018]  If so, hope has arrived.
[02:20:51.518 --> 02:20:52.959]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[02:20:53.219 --> 02:20:58.380]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:03.221]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[02:21:03.541 --> 02:21:12.183]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[02:21:12.683 --> 02:21:13.823]  Gum disease is serious.
[02:21:14.303 --> 02:21:18.064]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[02:21:18.344 --> 02:21:24.966]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[02:21:25.306 --> 02:21:29.347]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.

[02:21:45.327 --> 02:21:48.992]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:21:49.392 --> 02:21:54.819]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:21:55.299 --> 02:21:56.381]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[02:21:56.401 --> 02:22:00.446]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:22:01.090 --> 02:22:14.393]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:22:14.913 --> 02:22:20.195]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:22:20.515 --> 02:22:26.396]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:22:45.182 --> 02:22:49.703]  All across America, people are using the sun and wind to create enough energy to power their homes.
[02:22:50.483 --> 02:22:55.204]  For over 18 years, these people have trusted Sunilco to help them on the road to energy independence.
[02:22:55.948 --> 02:22:58.613]  Sunelco has systems to meet every need and budget.
[02:22:59.134 --> 02:23:03.542]  Complete home systems using solar, wind, hydroelectric or hydrogen fuel cells.
[02:23:04.063 --> 02:23:08.611]  With the rise in the cost of electricity, it makes sense to add renewable energy to your home or business.
[02:23:09.139 --> 02:23:13.582]  Many states offer cash rebates and tax breaks to those with renewable energy systems.
[02:23:14.042 --> 02:23:14.463]  It's easy!
[02:23:14.923 --> 02:23:18.906]  Many of Sunilco's systems come packaged for easy installation by the homeowner.
[02:23:19.306 --> 02:23:29.593]  Sunilco has a 106-page Renewable Energy Planning Guide and Catalog available for only $5 containing a detailed study to help anyone understand the how and why of renewable energy.

[02:23:46.831 --> 02:23:49.592]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:23:50.152 --> 02:23:53.514]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:23:56.095 --> 02:24:04.600]  Alright, I'm going to cover news for about 10-15 minutes, and then the last 20 minutes of the broadcast, I want to take about 15 phone calls.
[02:24:05.754 --> 02:24:07.616]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:07.636 --> 02:24:07.696]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:07.716 --> 02:24:08.276]  What's the bigger story?
[02:24:27.873 --> 02:24:37.140]  The rape of these people or the seconding globalist minions posing as conservatives saying it's good.
[02:24:40.202 --> 02:24:41.223]  This is so warped.
[02:24:43.505 --> 02:24:45.927]  And then they'll try to have these little mind games with you.
[02:24:45.947 --> 02:24:48.268]  Well, what if there was a bomb going to go off?
[02:24:49.689 --> 02:24:50.770]  I've heard this on the news.
[02:24:51.351 --> 02:24:52.932]  A guy knew, should you torture him?
[02:24:53.979 --> 02:24:56.560]  Let's see, the point is they're just grabbing women, children, you name it.
[02:24:57.121 --> 02:24:59.602]  The government's behind the terrorism, people!
[02:25:01.163 --> 02:25:02.864]  We've been caught them hundreds of times!
[02:25:03.584 --> 02:25:04.385]  Now this is the U.S.
[02:25:04.465 --> 02:25:06.686]  Army Report on Iraqi Prisoner Abuse.
[02:25:07.386 --> 02:25:17.272]  Complete text of the Article 15-6 Investigation of the 800th Military Police Brigade by Major General Antonio M. Taguba.
[02:25:18.906 --> 02:25:20.586]  And it is the exact text of it.
[02:25:20.626 --> 02:25:22.167]  We have it on the website.
[02:25:22.587 --> 02:25:26.748]  In case they take this down, Paul, I want to put it up in our own format, not just MSNBC.
[02:25:28.508 --> 02:25:34.690]  Through page 15 through page 20, they have Part 1 Detainee Abuse Findings Recommendations.
[02:25:35.890 --> 02:25:37.530]  And it's a 55-page report.
[02:25:37.550 --> 02:25:39.531]  I only read about 30 pages of it this morning.
[02:25:40.031 --> 02:25:42.371]  I'll have read the whole thing by tomorrow.
[02:25:43.952 --> 02:25:45.752]  Woke up and saw this on MSNBC.
[02:25:46.784 --> 02:25:53.808]  And so the neocons are saying there's no rape, no torture, it's all made up, or they're saying, sometimes in the same breath, that it's good!
[02:25:54.568 --> 02:25:56.189]  So more double-thinking for you.
[02:25:56.209 --> 02:26:00.472]  Now let's go into the findings.
[02:26:01.212 --> 02:26:09.117]  I find that the international, excuse me, the intentional abuse of these detainees by military police personnel included the following acts.
[02:26:10.077 --> 02:26:16.401]  Punching, slapping, and kicking detainees, jumping on their naked feet, videotaping and
[02:26:17.068 --> 02:26:20.269]  Photography of naked male and female detainees.
[02:26:20.589 --> 02:26:22.290]  Man, again, this is a whitewash, folks!
[02:26:23.850 --> 02:26:28.052]  Forcibly arranging detainees in various sexual explicit positions and photographing them.
[02:26:28.772 --> 02:26:29.572]  What's the big deal?
[02:26:29.612 --> 02:26:30.533]  That's good, hey!
[02:26:31.233 --> 02:26:35.735]  Forcing detainees to remove their clothing and keeping them naked for several days at a time.
[02:26:36.515 --> 02:26:38.956]  Forcing naked male detainees to wear women's underwear.
[02:26:40.056 --> 02:26:45.338]  Forcing groups of male detainees to masturbate themselves while being photographed and videotaped.
[02:26:46.147 --> 02:26:46.928]  Gets worse and worse.
[02:26:47.008 --> 02:26:49.850]  Arranging naked male detainees in a pile and then jumping on them.
[02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:53.813]  Also making them give each other... I'm not going to get into it.
[02:26:54.313 --> 02:27:05.302]  Positioning a naked detainee on a MRE box with a sandbag on his head and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, genitalia, and electrical torture.
[02:27:05.442 --> 02:27:13.388]  Now, by the way, we have it that they're actually electrocuting him, but they just say what they get from the photos.
[02:27:13.408 --> 02:27:15.250]  They say simulating electrical torture.
[02:27:16.696 --> 02:27:22.319]  Which our government for 50 years has trained people how to do at the School of America's at Georgia.
[02:27:24.180 --> 02:27:25.981]  So, it's just amazing.
[02:27:26.621 --> 02:27:29.082]  Writing, I am a rapist on the leg of a detainee.
[02:27:30.163 --> 02:27:36.206]  Placing a dog chain or strap around a naked detainee's neck and having a female soldier pose for a picture.
[02:27:37.087 --> 02:27:41.809]  A male military police officer having sex with a female detainee.
[02:27:41.829 --> 02:27:43.250]  Now, K.S.
[02:27:43.870 --> 02:27:45.751]  of page 17 is very important.
[02:27:46.320 --> 02:27:47.141]  Because that's rape.
[02:27:47.261 --> 02:27:51.164]  When a jail guard forces sex on somebody, when that happens, it's called rape.
[02:27:51.224 --> 02:27:53.166]  It's called rape, rape, rape.
[02:27:54.807 --> 02:27:57.490]  A male MP guard having sex with a female detainee.
[02:27:57.850 --> 02:27:59.031]  Why don't you just say rape?
[02:28:00.072 --> 02:28:07.478]  Using military working dogs without muzzles to intimidate and frighten detainees, and in at least one case, biting and severely injuring a detainee.
[02:28:07.919 --> 02:28:09.040]  And they have the evidence, too.
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:10.301]  There's photos of all this.
[02:28:10.541 --> 02:28:12.803]  We've only seen, what, five photos that they'll show us?
[02:28:14.730 --> 02:28:20.893]  The CD that was given by the military grunts who were angry about this to CBS has all this on it.
[02:28:22.975 --> 02:28:26.196]  And then they get into the second page of stuff here.
[02:28:27.277 --> 02:28:31.579]  And I can't read some of this on air despite the fact that it's mainstream news on MSNBC.
[02:28:31.720 --> 02:28:33.581]  I won't read some of this, but I can read some.
[02:28:34.181 --> 02:28:39.404]  Breaking chemical lights and pouring the phosphoric liquid onto detainees.
[02:28:39.564 --> 02:28:39.864]  Acid.
[02:28:40.565 --> 02:28:41.325]  Phosphoric acid.
[02:28:42.119 --> 02:28:45.080]  Threatening detainees with a loaded 9mm pistol.
[02:28:45.700 --> 02:28:47.480]  Pouring cold water on naked detainees.
[02:28:47.601 --> 02:28:49.981]  Beating detainees with a broom handle and a chair.
[02:28:50.381 --> 02:28:51.802]  And I heard the talk show host say, good!
[02:28:51.822 --> 02:28:53.002]  You know, what's the big deal?
[02:28:53.482 --> 02:28:55.283]  Threatening male detainees with rape.
[02:28:57.263 --> 02:29:04.105]  Allowing a military police guard to stitch a wound of a detainee who was injured after being slammed against the wall in his cell.
[02:29:04.925 --> 02:29:06.966]  So, they did it with no deadening, by the way.
[02:29:07.586 --> 02:29:11.507]  Sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light and perhaps a broomstick.
[02:29:12.921 --> 02:29:14.302]  They learned that in the New York PD.
[02:29:14.922 --> 02:29:17.763]  Using military working dogs to frighten and it goes on and on.
[02:29:20.484 --> 02:29:24.646]  Page after page after page after page after page.
[02:29:25.006 --> 02:29:27.748]  Only one of 32 camps that we know of in Iraq.
[02:29:28.248 --> 02:29:30.289]  Military intelligence running the whole thing.
[02:29:31.809 --> 02:29:32.870]  Raping women.
[02:29:36.432 --> 02:29:37.352]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.832 --> 02:29:39.333]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.343 --> 02:29:43.043]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.983 --> 02:29:53.207]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:29:53.367 --> 02:29:59.530]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:59.811 --> 02:30:08.236]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:30:08.496 --> 02:30:15.500]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:30:15.820 --> 02:30:20.643]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:30:20.863 --> 02:30:26.267]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:30:26.607 --> 02:30:29.669]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or night light.
[02:30:30.010 --> 02:30:38.015]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:38.035 --> 02:30:38.615]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:47.580 --> 02:30:49.641]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:30:49.821 --> 02:30:51.461]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot!
[02:30:51.581 --> 02:30:59.563]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:30:59.823 --> 02:31:06.264]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:31:06.424 --> 02:31:07.664]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:31:07.885 --> 02:31:11.325]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[02:31:11.405 --> 02:31:14.966]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[02:31:15.186 --> 02:31:20.710]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[02:31:21.010 --> 02:31:23.732]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[02:31:23.932 --> 02:31:27.955]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.
[02:31:28.175 --> 02:31:29.055]  No fires allowed?
[02:31:29.175 --> 02:31:30.176]  Hot meals still are?
[02:31:30.316 --> 02:31:33.859]  Call the Long Life Food Depot toll-free at 800-601-2833.
[02:31:34.579 --> 02:31:39.522]  That's 1-800-601-2833 or visit longlifefood.com.
[02:31:39.762 --> 02:31:43.105]  The Long Life Food Depot offers free shipping via UPS ground on every order.
[02:31:43.225 --> 02:31:43.665]  Don't wait!
[02:31:43.785 --> 02:31:44.986]  Call the Long Life Food Depot
[02:31:45.026 --> 02:31:46.667]  We're good to go today.
[02:31:46.767 --> 02:31:49.129]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:31:49.390 --> 02:31:53.233]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:31:53.553 --> 02:31:54.374]  Read the labels.
[02:31:54.794 --> 02:31:58.918]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:31:59.138 --> 02:32:03.341]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:32:03.702 --> 02:32:08.586]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:32:08.946 --> 02:32:12.548]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:32:12.728 --> 02:32:18.071]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:32:18.351 --> 02:32:21.072]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:32:21.373 --> 02:32:22.273]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:32:22.573 --> 02:32:33.299]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[02:32:33.679 --> 02:32:35.101]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:32:35.121 --> 02:32:36.522]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[02:32:36.562 --> 02:32:37.883]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:38.023 --> 02:32:39.625]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:32:58.776 --> 02:33:08.239]  Alright, let me blitz through a bunch of news and information, then we'll go to Greg and Tom and Buddy and Justin and Kelly and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:33:10.519 --> 02:33:12.620]  Yesterday, there was an article out of Florida.
[02:33:12.660 --> 02:33:20.522]  Jeb Bush signed a law making it a third-degree felony in his state to run an unlicensed FM or AM radio station.
[02:33:21.405 --> 02:33:24.466]  They claim that terrorists could use it to jam emergency signals.
[02:33:24.526 --> 02:33:25.506]  I mean, how ridiculous, sir?
[02:33:26.006 --> 02:33:28.407]  Oh, it might cause air traffic problems.
[02:33:29.107 --> 02:33:31.188]  Folks, I have family who are pilots.
[02:33:31.668 --> 02:33:37.710]  The air traffic band on FM isn't on the same band as the AM and FM band.
[02:33:38.670 --> 02:33:43.351]  Sometimes 100,000 watt FM transmitters are off and do interfere with one channel.
[02:33:43.772 --> 02:33:45.132]  They just switch to the next.
[02:33:45.532 --> 02:33:47.353]  But see now, everything's terrorism.
[02:33:47.453 --> 02:33:48.293]  Everything has to
[02:33:49.256 --> 02:33:51.297]  No, it's the First Amendment coming across.
[02:33:51.437 --> 02:33:53.617]  Micro-FM was used to fight the Soviets.
[02:33:54.038 --> 02:33:56.438]  It was used to fight people down in Latin America.
[02:33:56.458 --> 02:33:57.339]  Our governments used it.
[02:33:58.159 --> 02:33:59.999]  But no, we just can't have that.
[02:34:00.039 --> 02:34:07.262]  Now, that's only in Florida, where there are just hundreds of unlicensed stations that have become quite popular.
[02:34:08.362 --> 02:34:12.023]  And until the early 80s, it was totally legal to have one of these.
[02:34:12.083 --> 02:34:13.204]  Then it became a civil problem.
[02:34:13.484 --> 02:34:15.064]  But people actually wanted to use it.
[02:34:16.365 --> 02:34:17.605]  They said, oh no, you can't do that.
[02:34:18.425 --> 02:34:21.890]  So, you know, you can only have two companies owning all the radio stations.
[02:34:23.091 --> 02:34:24.433]  It's basically the moral of the story.
[02:34:26.135 --> 02:34:30.661]  They also want to ban .50 caliber rifles that have only been used in one crime in U.S.
[02:34:30.681 --> 02:34:31.041]  history.
[02:34:32.583 --> 02:34:35.207]  Former military officer used one to rob an armored truck.
[02:34:36.500 --> 02:34:37.821]  One crime in U.S.
[02:34:37.841 --> 02:34:38.202]  history.
[02:34:38.442 --> 02:34:38.902]  Didn't matter.
[02:34:38.942 --> 02:34:40.423]  I don't care if it was used in a million crimes.
[02:34:40.744 --> 02:34:42.025]  You don't take my right away.
[02:34:42.285 --> 02:34:47.850]  But the Democrats in the television shows advertise it as a weapon of mass destruction.
[02:34:48.010 --> 02:34:50.312]  Advertise how to use it as a terrorist.
[02:34:50.392 --> 02:34:51.793]  Hoping some nutcase does it.
[02:34:53.274 --> 02:34:56.757]  Every day it's an advertisement of how to do something criminal.
[02:34:59.399 --> 02:34:59.980]  And uh...
[02:35:01.542 --> 02:35:03.584]  These bills won't just ban .50 cal.
[02:35:03.624 --> 02:35:07.108]  They've also got all these bills at the state level to ban stuff down to .308.
[02:35:09.290 --> 02:35:11.973]  Moran introduces a bill to ban high-powered rifles.
[02:35:12.053 --> 02:35:16.938]  They're high-powered guns that can down an airplane from up to a mile away.
[02:35:17.919 --> 02:35:19.140]  Yeah, one shot up a million.
[02:35:19.441 --> 02:35:19.821]  So could a .22.
[02:35:21.326 --> 02:35:25.267]  And a Northern Virginia lawmaker wants to make sure they don't fall into the wrong hands.
[02:35:25.388 --> 02:35:31.970]  Representative Jim Moran, Democrat from Virginia, said Monday he was introducing legislation that would ban the commercial sale of .50 caliber rifles.
[02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:37.952]  Backers of the bill say the weapons are easily attainable and less regulated than common handguns.
[02:35:37.972 --> 02:35:38.592]  That's not true.
[02:35:39.073 --> 02:35:40.173]  And then on top of it,
[02:35:41.677 --> 02:35:44.440]  So speaking near the train tracks within view of the U.S.
[02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:50.885]  Capitol Dome, Moran said terrorists could fire a gun on a rail car carrying hazardous cargo through the heart of the nation.
[02:35:51.205 --> 02:35:56.089]  They then say that Moran said Al-Qaeda is known to have purchased 25 of the rifles.
[02:35:56.389 --> 02:35:56.830]  You know what?
[02:35:56.850 --> 02:36:10.261]  We actually have the purchase order from that in the late 1980s, 1987, where hundreds of them, not 25, were sold to the Taliban and Al-Qaeda by guess who?
[02:36:12.071 --> 02:36:16.134]  The Central Intelligence Agency!
[02:36:16.674 --> 02:36:19.216]  I mean, oh, so now you've got to be punished for that!
[02:36:21.517 --> 02:36:29.142]  And Tom Diaz, an analyst at the Violence Policy Center, who said they're going to get all our guns, by the way, estimates that there are thousands in circulation.
[02:36:29.182 --> 02:36:33.265]  The guns have turned up in arms caches and militia groups and drug dealers.
[02:36:33.925 --> 02:36:34.526]  Oh my goodness!
[02:36:36.485 --> 02:36:43.930]  And the National Rifle Association said that the guns are used for hunting big game and for marksmanship competitions among other purposes and that's true.
[02:36:45.651 --> 02:36:48.693]  The legislation is an attempt to play on people's emotions, he said.
[02:36:52.355 --> 02:36:53.016]  Oh my goodness.
[02:36:53.096 --> 02:37:02.161]  And it says this is a continuation of a trend started by gun ban groups and politicians to try and exploit the tragedy of 9-11 to further their failing agenda on gun control.
[02:37:04.143 --> 02:37:04.763]  And uh...
[02:37:06.130 --> 02:37:14.415]  Alder Nodam, that's his name, predicted that terrorists would be able to skirt such a law because they do not follow laws or leave paper trails.
[02:37:14.435 --> 02:37:14.875]  That's true.
[02:37:15.256 --> 02:37:16.756]  Plus, the government controls the terrorists.
[02:37:18.217 --> 02:37:19.118]  There's a poll.
[02:37:20.319 --> 02:37:24.381]  Terror attack to boost Bush out of the Connecticut Post.
[02:37:25.001 --> 02:37:25.982]  And I've always said this.
[02:37:26.122 --> 02:37:32.125]  I mean, the terrorists, if they were real terrorists, know that blowing something up only helps their enemies.
[02:37:32.966 --> 02:37:33.506]  Why would they do it?
[02:37:33.526 --> 02:37:34.047]  Because they're CIA.
[02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:42.864]  And it said, would-be terrorists might want to think again if they plan to try to hurt President Bush's politically by staging a pre-election attack.
[02:37:43.444 --> 02:37:51.087]  A new nationwide poll conducted by the Sacred Heart University Polling Institute suggests more people think it would be Bush, not the U.S.
[02:37:51.127 --> 02:37:56.310]  Senator John Kerry, whose election chances would get a boost from a terrorist act on U.S.
[02:37:56.350 --> 02:37:58.591]  soil just prior to November elections.
[02:37:59.221 --> 02:38:00.541]  They don't have to blow something up.
[02:38:00.561 --> 02:38:01.882]  They control the voting machines.
[02:38:02.422 --> 02:38:03.422]  Sides of Kerry wins.
[02:38:03.442 --> 02:38:05.862]  It's a skull and bones cousin of Bush.
[02:38:06.402 --> 02:38:13.804]  Perhaps that is because 52.5% of the same respondents say Bush would be better at understanding the worldwide terror threat.
[02:38:14.004 --> 02:38:14.504]  I would agree.
[02:38:14.584 --> 02:38:15.444]  Takes one to know one.
[02:38:16.004 --> 02:38:21.426]  Also, 48.8% say Bush has a better shot at finding Osama Bin Laden his business partner.
[02:38:21.446 --> 02:38:23.426]  I mean, come on, people!
[02:38:25.484 --> 02:38:27.245]  People want someone they can relate to.
[02:38:27.365 --> 02:38:28.666]  Someone who's down-to-earth.
[02:38:28.706 --> 02:38:30.167]  Who's like them, said Lindsey.
[02:38:30.988 --> 02:38:34.110]  Who we were looking to find out a little more about the general perception.
[02:38:36.171 --> 02:38:36.812]  Oh, please.
[02:38:36.972 --> 02:38:41.035]  Poison oozes into the water supply this side of the Arizona Republic.
[02:38:42.536 --> 02:38:44.537]  You need to call and get a big murky, folks.
[02:38:44.597 --> 02:38:45.658]  Stop drinking the poison.
[02:38:46.598 --> 02:38:52.883]  From the Colorado River to the North Phoenix, explosives firm has been
[02:38:53.789 --> 02:38:56.750]  Seeping into Arizona's water supply.
[02:38:56.991 --> 02:38:57.771]  Let me read that again.
[02:38:58.271 --> 02:39:07.155]  From the Colorado River to a North Phoenix explosives firm, poison has been seeping into Arizona's water supply.
[02:39:07.255 --> 02:39:11.017]  Now it has flown, due to attention,
[02:39:11.906 --> 02:39:19.552]  of state officials who on Tuesday announced a task force to track the amount of the contaminant in Arizona's water supplies.
[02:39:19.593 --> 02:39:31.322]  The effort by four state agencies could create the state's first ever standard for testing for the chemical, a component of rocket fuel that has been shown to inhibit the function of the thyroid gland.
[02:39:32.183 --> 02:39:33.004]  Boy, isn't it funny?
[02:39:33.204 --> 02:39:38.048]  Sodium fluoride, rocket fuel, all this stuff inhibits the thyroid gland.
[02:39:38.985 --> 02:39:45.888]  The state has set up 14 ppb at the health base guidance level, but has no standard.
[02:39:45.928 --> 02:39:48.209]  It's possible the task force could recommend a standard.
[02:39:48.609 --> 02:39:49.270]  Owen said.
[02:39:52.411 --> 02:39:54.812]  Just every day it's something new in the water, folks.
[02:39:55.352 --> 02:39:57.873]  If you're drinking tap water, you're totally insane.
[02:39:58.494 --> 02:40:03.976]  And all bottled water is, in most cases, is filtered, not purified, tap water.
[02:40:04.921 --> 02:40:06.823]  Call New Millennium Concepts.
[02:40:07.323 --> 02:40:08.964]  Tell them you want a big Berkey.
[02:40:09.304 --> 02:40:10.565]  The best system out there.
[02:40:10.605 --> 02:40:11.987]  They got so many other items.
[02:40:12.107 --> 02:40:20.173]  Give them a call.
[02:40:20.193 --> 02:40:21.014]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:40:21.034 --> 02:40:21.334]  1-888-803-4438.

[02:40:28.019 --> 02:40:33.063]  Disney forbidding distribution of film that criticizes Bush, New York Times reporting.
[02:40:34.207 --> 02:40:42.191]  The Walt Disney Company is blocking its Miramax division from distributing a new documentary by Michael Moore that harshly criticizes President Bush.
[02:40:43.031 --> 02:40:55.598]  Executives at both Disney and Miramax said Tuesday, the film Fahrenheit 9-11 links Mr. Bush and prominent Saudis, including the family of Osama Bin Laden, and criticizes Mr. Bush's actions before and after September 11th terror attacks.
[02:40:55.698 --> 02:41:02.101]  Disney, which bought Miramax more than a decade ago, is contractual agreement with Miramax's principles.
[02:41:03.866 --> 02:41:14.033]  Bob and Harvey Weinstein, allowing it to prevent the company from distributing films under certain circumstances like an excessive budget or an NC-17 rating.
[02:41:14.874 --> 02:41:22.258]  Executives at Miramax, who became principal investors in Mr. Moore's project last spring, do not believe this is one of those cases.
[02:41:22.319 --> 02:41:24.340]  People involved in the production of the film said,
[02:41:25.083 --> 02:41:33.866]  If a compromise is not reached, these people said, the matter could go to meltdown through neither side is said to want to travel that realm.
[02:41:34.587 --> 02:41:40.549]  In a statement, Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesman for Miramax said, we're discussing the issue with Disney.
[02:41:40.829 --> 02:41:45.311]  We're looking at all of our options and look forward to resolving this amicably.
[02:41:48.512 --> 02:41:51.973]  Yeah, after Michael Moore cuts out anything that's too damaging.
[02:41:53.507 --> 02:41:55.788]  Marines arrive in Morgantown.
[02:41:57.309 --> 02:41:59.030]  This out of the Dominion Post.
[02:41:59.490 --> 02:42:02.072]  Arriving in waves over the past few days.
[02:42:02.532 --> 02:42:12.497]  The last of 1,700 Marines of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit out of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, washed into Camp Dawson last night.
[02:42:13.783 --> 02:42:20.946]  The MEU is a special operations unit made up of 2,200 soldiers that perform classified, covert missions for the U.S.
[02:42:20.986 --> 02:42:21.326]  government.
[02:42:21.806 --> 02:42:25.928]  Uh, yeah, I have video of them training to take your guns and admitting it's for U.S.
[02:42:25.948 --> 02:42:29.029]  citizens in Police State 2000 and Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:42:30.050 --> 02:42:40.694]  For about the next three weeks, the Marines will flood abandoned buildings, blowing them up, in downtown Morgantown, downtown Fairmont, and surrounding areas to simulate urban combat situations they can encounter on deployment.
[02:42:41.303 --> 02:42:44.384]  By the way, sometimes they set up checkpoints and arrest citizens.
[02:42:44.424 --> 02:42:45.104]  We have video of that.
[02:42:45.604 --> 02:42:51.566]  When they hit the streets, the Marines will be wearing full combat gear, hopping in and out of helicopters as part of their exercises.
[02:42:51.826 --> 02:42:56.908]  By the way, helicopters have crashed, troops have died, and then it's a minor footnote in the newspaper when it happens in other cities.
[02:42:57.535 --> 02:43:01.818]  Morgantown residents, they also fired bullets into a Miami restaurant, crashed a helicopter in Houston.
[02:43:02.178 --> 02:43:12.786]  Morgantown residents will also hear gunshots, most of which will be blanks, most of which, any live ammunition will be fired very sparingly into bullet traps that will catch the shell and prevent it from exploding.
[02:43:13.146 --> 02:43:17.429]  This is admitted, the Army admits, and the Navy admits, for conditioning.
[02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:24.735]  We're working very closely with the city government and the staff of Camp Davidson to make sure this training goes as smoothly as possible.
[02:43:25.255 --> 02:43:26.356]  They do this in every city.
[02:43:27.244 --> 02:43:39.840]  There's going to be CH-46 Sea Knights, CH-53 helicopters to transport vehicles, Cobra helicopters to provide artillery and ammunition to the soldiers during the drills, and it goes on and on.
[02:43:42.415 --> 02:43:43.276]  More conditioning.
[02:43:44.036 --> 02:43:47.218]  Court records undocumented workers go into Navy base.
[02:43:47.858 --> 02:43:55.302]  Daily Press reports some illegal immigrants, including members of the violent Salvadoran gang, got into the world's largest naval base to conduct work.
[02:43:55.382 --> 02:43:57.523]  Federal investigations allege in court documents.
[02:43:57.843 --> 02:44:00.545]  Well, yeah, if you're not an illegal alien, you can't get a government job nowadays.
[02:44:01.986 --> 02:44:02.886]  That's just some of it.
[02:44:03.687 --> 02:44:06.188]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls and I'll hit some more news.
[02:44:07.003 --> 02:44:09.965]  And as soon as you hear somebody hang up, call in at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:44:10.065 --> 02:44:14.147]  Greg in Texas, go ahead.
[02:44:14.687 --> 02:44:15.508]  Love the work you're doing.
[02:44:15.688 --> 02:44:17.249]  I just had a question with the TV.
[02:44:17.349 --> 02:44:22.692]  President Planet, for passing the word, how come you require so much user information?
[02:44:23.212 --> 02:44:26.094]  More people might be inclined if they were anonymous.
[02:44:26.594 --> 02:44:28.735]  And otherwise, another question about Berkey.
[02:44:29.015 --> 02:44:30.136]  Isn't that also a filter?
[02:44:31.641 --> 02:44:32.081]  Well, no.
[02:44:32.362 --> 02:44:37.726]  You can say it filters water, but this is a purification level certified.
[02:44:37.766 --> 02:44:43.110]  There's very few that are purifiers that can actually be called a purifier.
[02:44:43.130 --> 02:44:49.655]  I don't think... See, a filter just has to, quote, filter the water to a certain standard.
[02:44:50.075 --> 02:44:52.097]  A purifier cuts it all out.
[02:44:52.517 --> 02:44:54.018]  Oh, so the degree of how clean it gets.
[02:44:54.979 --> 02:44:55.279]  Oh, yeah.
[02:44:55.359 --> 02:44:56.620]  And let me go back to prisonplanet.tv.
[02:44:58.559 --> 02:45:05.082]  The problem with giving your secure data is that companies, pizza places, Walmart, others, they sell it.
[02:45:05.603 --> 02:45:07.904]  We have never sold one piece of information.
[02:45:08.244 --> 02:45:13.487]  If you want to buy a video by mail, you don't go in our file.
[02:45:14.047 --> 02:45:21.251]  But we keep everything for a couple months, so if somebody doesn't get a tape or doesn't like what they got, we can make sure they order it, send them another one.
[02:45:21.671 --> 02:45:23.432]  I mean, this is just modern society.
[02:45:23.892 --> 02:45:27.314]  And to have a certified secure server, it's all on our server.
[02:45:27.954 --> 02:45:29.755]  Big firewalls, all that stuff.
[02:45:30.035 --> 02:45:35.397]  To go sign up at PrisonPlanet.TV, it's a secure server.
[02:45:35.457 --> 02:45:37.537]  We have to make sure it's your credit card, sir.
[02:45:38.178 --> 02:45:39.038]  Alright, keep up the good work.
[02:45:39.318 --> 02:45:40.378]  Alright, I appreciate it.
[02:45:41.299 --> 02:45:43.279]  I mean, have you ever bought anything on the internet before?
[02:45:43.299 --> 02:45:44.180]  I mean, that's the question.
[02:45:46.332 --> 02:45:48.633]  I would hope that everybody would buy the videos.
[02:45:48.793 --> 02:45:50.254]  You can call toll free to get them.
[02:45:50.514 --> 02:45:51.395]  You can write to us.
[02:45:51.435 --> 02:45:54.837]  You can order via our secure, safe online shopping cart.
[02:45:55.557 --> 02:45:57.758]  I'm not trying to hide from the new world order.
[02:45:57.958 --> 02:45:59.419]  I'm out in the open being bold.
[02:46:00.057 --> 02:46:11.703]  When I point out their surveillance, I'm showing the cashless society control grid going in, where they'll face scan you at the grocery store, and if you haven't paid your tickets, your credit card isn't going to work.
[02:46:11.923 --> 02:46:12.943]  That's what we're pointing out.
[02:46:13.423 --> 02:46:20.687]  We're not trying to creep around and hide from the New World Order, though you have total privacy when you sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:46:21.667 --> 02:46:23.548]  And I meant to plug that, so I might as well do it.
[02:46:25.109 --> 02:46:29.391]  It's 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a month,
[02:46:30.106 --> 02:46:33.127]  We had to do this because we now had to order even another server.
[02:46:33.607 --> 02:46:36.388]  Thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars a month.
[02:46:36.888 --> 02:46:39.508]  When you get 20 million visitors a month, it gets very expensive.
[02:46:40.289 --> 02:46:46.310]  We want to offer video and audio and all this, but we can offer some of it for free, about half of it for free.
[02:46:46.770 --> 02:46:54.512]  But if you want some of the exclusive stuff, weekly TV reports, the high bandwidth stuff, you gotta sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:46:54.892 --> 02:46:58.353]  And it's a great deal, and I hope you'll go sign up with it.
[02:46:58.957 --> 02:47:02.042]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:47:02.462 --> 02:47:03.904]  Tom in Portland, Oregon.
[02:47:03.924 --> 02:47:04.686]  Tom, go ahead.
[02:47:04.866 --> 02:47:05.647]  How's it going, Alex?
[02:47:05.847 --> 02:47:06.188]  Good, sir.
[02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:15.437]  I wouldn't comment on the gentleman you had last week, the lawyer from Portland that had the 76-year-old lady that was tasered.
[02:47:15.537 --> 02:47:18.599]  And the 95-year-old mother brutally attacked, yes.
[02:47:18.639 --> 02:47:25.524]  Well, the gentleman that was killed here in Portland about three weeks ago for not putting on his right-hand blinker 24 seconds into the stop.
[02:47:25.785 --> 02:47:29.227]  And they also just blew away a pregnant woman who got her hands up.
[02:47:30.661 --> 02:47:39.143]  Well, anyway, the cop, Jason Siri, that killed this gentleman, Juan Perez, here, about three weeks ago, he also stunned him after they shot him three times in the chest.
[02:47:39.163 --> 02:47:42.964]  They gave him a stun gun for three minutes, and the stun gun has a recording device on it.
[02:47:43.264 --> 02:47:44.704]  That's the only reason they knew about that.
[02:47:44.984 --> 02:47:48.205]  Well, that was to make sure they died, because if they don't die, they can then sue you.
[02:47:48.525 --> 02:47:49.425]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:47:49.485 --> 02:47:58.427]  But, anyway, one week after that happened, after that incident, there's a grand jury investigating whether they're going to indict Siri on murder, which, of course, they didn't.
[02:47:58.967 --> 02:47:59.607]  But, anyway,
[02:48:00.225 --> 02:48:03.727]  They made him a top cop of the year, is what he got.
[02:48:03.747 --> 02:48:11.212]  Why he was being under investigation by a grand jury... No, because if you're a criminal, if you're a thug, you get top cop.
[02:48:11.633 --> 02:48:17.536]  And also, Amy Goodman is coming into Portland on Saturday, and I'm going to be able to ask her a few questions.
[02:48:17.717 --> 02:48:21.299]  If you had a chance to speak to her, what would you like to ask her?
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:26.766]  Well, I tell her, why don't you talk about Mayor Willie Brown being told not to fly because he's a liberal like you?
[02:48:27.608 --> 02:48:31.553]  Why are you for taking our guns when Hitler was for gun control?
[02:48:31.933 --> 02:48:33.375]  Why don't you tell the whole story?
[02:48:33.415 --> 02:48:36.620]  Don't you know big government is a tool of the big corporations?
[02:48:37.944 --> 02:48:38.765]  Okay, very good.
[02:48:38.805 --> 02:48:42.468]  Thank you so much, Alex, and thank you for all your work, and thank you for Prism Planet TV.
[02:48:42.488 --> 02:48:43.649]  It's great stuff, man.
[02:48:43.669 --> 02:48:44.270]  I appreciate it.
[02:48:44.570 --> 02:48:46.172]  Oh, you signed up at prismplanet.tv?
[02:48:46.192 --> 02:48:50.035]  Yeah, I just signed up for the monthly because I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to have internet.
[02:48:50.275 --> 02:48:50.936]  I have to move here.
[02:48:50.956 --> 02:48:51.937]  Well, I appreciate you.
[02:48:52.297 --> 02:48:52.878]  Do you like it?
[02:48:52.898 --> 02:48:54.700]  Yeah, it's really nice so far.
[02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:55.841]  Yeah, it's really nice.
[02:48:56.201 --> 02:49:03.568]  You know, we've got to give it a little more time because it's going to, I'm sure it's going to get really, really nice here in just a matter of a month or two when you get some more material going on there.
[02:49:04.110 --> 02:49:06.972]  There's a lot to get on there, and for the price, you can't beat it.
[02:49:07.212 --> 02:49:09.974]  Alright, well thank you for the support, Tom.
[02:49:09.994 --> 02:49:10.774]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:49:10.815 --> 02:49:11.455]  Have a good day, though.
[02:49:11.555 --> 02:49:12.396]  Take care, my friend.
[02:49:13.236 --> 02:49:14.397]  Betsy in Florida.
[02:49:14.477 --> 02:49:15.298]  Betsy, go ahead.
[02:49:15.318 --> 02:49:16.738]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:49:16.879 --> 02:49:18.600]  It is really a pleasure to talk to you.
[02:49:18.740 --> 02:49:22.823]  I just want you to know in brief that my husband just got elected mayor of our city.
[02:49:23.203 --> 02:49:23.703]  Oh, wow!
[02:49:24.023 --> 02:49:27.486]  Yep, and what started it all was me.
[02:49:27.566 --> 02:49:32.329]  I'm a disabled person, and I just want to let people out there know one person can change a lot.
[02:49:33.010 --> 02:49:34.151]  Even with a disability.
[02:49:34.211 --> 02:49:35.031]  What is your town?
[02:49:35.992 --> 02:49:38.634]  We live in Callaway, Florida, which is in the Panhandle.
[02:49:39.715 --> 02:49:46.359]  And what happened was, in December, we got a notice about our water and found out that it had halothetic acid in it.
[02:49:46.379 --> 02:49:47.800]  I don't know if you're familiar with that.
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:48.461]  Oh, yes.
[02:49:48.641 --> 02:49:49.041]  Okay.
[02:49:49.461 --> 02:49:50.882]  And, of course, other toxins.
[02:49:51.543 --> 02:49:56.526]  I did everything I could to get all kinds of information, and I got a lot of cooperation at the state level.
[02:49:56.907 --> 02:49:58.668]  But when it came down to our local people,
[02:49:59.383 --> 02:50:00.323]  They didn't want to talk.
[02:50:00.403 --> 02:50:01.823]  They didn't want to put it on the news.
[02:50:02.103 --> 02:50:04.164]  They didn't want to put it on our agenda.
[02:50:05.044 --> 02:50:06.224]  And I got very suspicious.
[02:50:07.564 --> 02:50:10.025]  And basically, I got a lot of flack.
[02:50:10.585 --> 02:50:13.745]  So that's what started me thinking of running for office myself.
[02:50:13.825 --> 02:50:16.086]  But because of my disability, I couldn't do it.
[02:50:16.306 --> 02:50:18.106]  And so your husband ran and won.
[02:50:18.246 --> 02:50:18.786]  And he won.
[02:50:20.447 --> 02:50:23.207]  Obviously, you don't have the Diebold voting machines.
[02:50:24.687 --> 02:50:25.567]  I don't think so.
[02:50:26.128 --> 02:50:28.328]  But I wanted to ask you about putting
[02:50:29.540 --> 02:50:31.380]  Reaffirming the Bill of Rights in our town?
[02:50:31.420 --> 02:50:32.341]  How you go about doing that?
[02:50:32.361 --> 02:50:32.981]  Okay, stay there.
[02:50:33.041 --> 02:50:34.181]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:50:34.201 --> 02:50:39.102]  Then we'll go to Justin and Kelly, try to get a few final calls in as well.
[02:50:40.303 --> 02:50:43.563]  And I'm glad people are signing up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:50:47.164 --> 02:50:48.805]  What really happened September 11th?
[02:50:48.965 --> 02:50:50.025]  And who stands to gain?
[02:50:50.766 --> 02:50:52.048]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:50:52.248 --> 02:50:57.996]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:50:58.276 --> 02:51:03.543]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:51:03.824 --> 02:51:05.446]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order
[02:51:05.646 --> 02:51:07.107]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:51:25.519 --> 02:51:27.601]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[02:51:27.681 --> 02:51:31.044]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:51:41.574 --> 02:51:43.076]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:51:43.256 --> 02:51:45.338]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:51:46.030 --> 02:51:53.554]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:51:53.834 --> 02:52:04.740]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:52:05.000 --> 02:52:06.802]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:52:07.082 --> 02:52:10.406]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:52:10.746 --> 02:52:12.087]  But it's worth every penny.
[02:52:12.208 --> 02:52:21.197]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:52:21.497 --> 02:52:21.997]  That's right!
[02:52:22.177 --> 02:52:29.281]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:52:29.581 --> 02:52:33.703]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:53:47.177 --> 02:53:52.321]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:53.002 --> 02:53:55.424]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:53:56.424 --> 02:53:58.666]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:53:59.066 --> 02:54:00.568]  Back from 9 to midnight Central.
[02:54:01.388 --> 02:54:02.169]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:54:03.909 --> 02:54:05.811]  We're talking to Betsy in Florida.
[02:54:06.131 --> 02:54:08.973]  And I'm telling you, the power is at the county and city level.
[02:54:10.034 --> 02:54:12.156]  And that's where we've got to take over and get elected.
[02:54:13.117 --> 02:54:17.160]  And you take a hot issue like this that everybody's concerned about, you can really change things.
[02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:18.662]  So your husband's been elected mayor.
[02:54:19.562 --> 02:54:23.025]  Go to Infowars.com and go to the Patriot Act section.
[02:54:23.065 --> 02:54:28.029]  We've got my Save the Bill of Rights campaign law that I wrote that a lot of towns have passed.
[02:54:28.069 --> 02:54:29.671]  There's a bunch of other versions out there.
[02:54:30.484 --> 02:54:34.027]  Get it introduced to the city council and get them to vote on it and pass it.
[02:54:34.887 --> 02:54:38.169]  Alex, do you do that by a petition from the people?
[02:54:39.310 --> 02:54:41.032]  Well, that's always nice, but no.
[02:54:42.012 --> 02:54:45.234]  A petition is to the mayor to bring that forward.
[02:54:45.635 --> 02:54:46.736]  Your husband's the mayor.
[02:54:47.136 --> 02:54:49.578]  He can bring it to the council and then have them vote on it.
[02:54:49.958 --> 02:54:50.338]  Okay.
[02:54:51.359 --> 02:54:54.181]  I also wanted to know, Alex, do you go around the country giving speeches?
[02:54:54.561 --> 02:54:55.141]  No, I don't.
[02:54:55.462 --> 02:54:57.883]  I mean, I do three or four radio interviews every day.
[02:54:57.923 --> 02:54:58.504]  I do this show.
[02:54:58.564 --> 02:54:59.264]  I do TV shows.
[02:54:59.324 --> 02:54:59.965]  I do films.
[02:55:01.483 --> 02:55:04.285]  And also in a couple movies.
[02:55:05.086 --> 02:55:05.726]  That's what I do.
[02:55:05.787 --> 02:55:07.508]  I just sit here in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:07.548 --> 02:55:08.529]  Sometimes I travel.
[02:55:09.150 --> 02:55:12.793]  I get offers every week, and I appreciate all the offers, but I just can't do it.
[02:55:13.313 --> 02:55:15.235]  Well, thank you for everything you've done in Gutless.
[02:55:15.836 --> 02:55:16.236]  Thank you.
[02:55:16.556 --> 02:55:21.841]  Yeah, I can travel 2,000 miles to talk to 1,000 people, or I can talk to millions every day.
[02:55:21.881 --> 02:55:23.663]  It's a cost-benefit analysis.
[02:55:23.903 --> 02:55:24.643]  I love to travel.
[02:55:25.544 --> 02:55:27.266]  I traveled a lot before I was a talk show host.
[02:55:27.927 --> 02:55:29.668]  Had some nice vacations, but not anymore.
[02:55:30.508 --> 02:55:32.709]  Let's go ahead and talk to Justin in Ohio.
[02:55:32.749 --> 02:55:33.329]  Justin, go ahead.
[02:55:33.349 --> 02:55:34.690]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:55:34.730 --> 02:55:34.970]  Good.
[02:55:35.430 --> 02:55:37.751]  Hey, I love your show and I wish we had you on here in Columbus.
[02:55:38.551 --> 02:55:53.577]  My question for you after watching 9-11 Road to Tyranny and noticing how like a lot of the individuals said that, but you have a document that a lot of individuals said there were extra explosions apart from the supposed bombing by Timothy McVeigh as well as the airliners.
[02:55:54.804 --> 02:55:58.125]  What do you see is going on with the Statue of Liberty?
[02:55:58.585 --> 02:56:01.606]  I mean, the Statue of Liberty has been closed since 9-11.
[02:56:02.506 --> 02:56:08.647]  And my thinking is that where would another terrorist attack be that would get people to give up all their rights?
[02:56:08.687 --> 02:56:14.869]  I mean, what more symbolic or sentimental item in the country would get people to give up their rights other than an attack on the Statue of Liberty?
[02:56:15.869 --> 02:56:20.750]  I would agree that the globalists would love to do that, but I don't like to say where they're going to attack next.
[02:56:22.007 --> 02:56:26.328]  I know Larry Silverstein, who owned the World Trade Center complex, just bought the Sears Tower.
[02:56:27.029 --> 02:56:28.389]  They're saying that's a big target.
[02:56:29.389 --> 02:56:31.750]  But I just don't know where they're going to strike next.
[02:56:31.790 --> 02:56:34.431]  You know, it's like, where is a serial killer going to strike next?
[02:56:34.971 --> 02:56:37.192]  That's not how the serial killer is going to strike.
[02:56:37.692 --> 02:56:42.013]  I agree with you 100%, but thinking about why is the Statue of Liberty still closed?
[02:56:42.053 --> 02:56:43.454]  And it has been closed since September 11th.
[02:56:43.494 --> 02:56:45.714]  And about 10 years ago, they redid it before!
[02:56:45.734 --> 02:56:47.775]  I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
[02:56:49.255 --> 02:56:51.616]  There's no rational reason why the Statue of Liberty is closed.
[02:56:51.976 --> 02:56:53.896]  It just leads me to believe that something is going on there.
[02:56:53.916 --> 02:56:55.897]  Maybe I'm just looking into it too much.
[02:56:55.957 --> 02:56:56.377]  I don't know.
[02:56:58.318 --> 02:56:59.598]  We'll check into it, Justin.
[02:56:59.638 --> 02:57:00.098]  Call me back.
[02:57:00.118 --> 02:57:00.998]  We'll talk more about it.
[02:57:01.058 --> 02:57:03.279]  Last caller, Kelly in Ohio.
[02:57:03.359 --> 02:57:04.159]  Kelly, go ahead.
[02:57:05.019 --> 02:57:06.000]  Yes, sir, Mr. Jones.
[02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:10.441]  I'd like to say hello and make one comment and two brief questions.
[02:57:10.481 --> 02:57:11.561]  Three, actually, if you don't mind.
[02:57:13.422 --> 02:57:13.582]  Hello?
[02:57:15.126 --> 02:57:15.406]  Uh, yes.
[02:57:15.506 --> 02:57:17.727]  My one comment is I appreciate Prison Planet.
[02:57:17.767 --> 02:57:21.349]  I think it's got great material on it, and I plan on becoming a member to support you.
[02:57:21.409 --> 02:57:26.351]  And not only are you an asset to America, but really the future of humankind.
[02:57:26.991 --> 02:57:28.932]  Because this thing's on such a grand scale.
[02:57:29.032 --> 02:57:31.553]  And on that, I'd like to move on to my question.
[02:57:32.813 --> 02:57:33.073]  Okay.
[02:57:33.614 --> 02:57:34.734]  My first question is this.
[02:57:35.634 --> 02:57:41.377]  Do you think that the Iraqis are not only fighting for their future, but everybody around the world as well?
[02:57:41.417 --> 02:57:43.938]  Because it seems like that is a stronghold for
[02:57:45.173 --> 02:57:58.940]  Well, they're saying they're going to use it as a military launch base, and certainly they plan to go into other countries after they're done there, but it's just a bad situation all the way around.
[02:57:58.980 --> 02:57:59.720]  Go ahead and finish.
[02:58:00.321 --> 02:58:05.223]  But without that, I mean, without establishing that, they couldn't further their agenda, could they?
[02:58:07.435 --> 02:58:16.181]  Well, the national draft and a few million more people, after they blow something else up, they probably will move into other countries, but for the time being, I agree with you.
[02:58:17.162 --> 02:58:24.967]  My second question is, what do you think the time frame is on the final implementation of a new world, of them implementing the new world order?
[02:58:24.987 --> 02:58:26.108]  You mean going to the next level?
[02:58:26.889 --> 02:58:28.990]  Implementing the final phase.
[02:58:29.130 --> 02:58:29.851]  Okay, I'm out of time.
[02:58:30.531 --> 02:58:33.673]  Right before the election or right after the election, it's going to escalate.
[02:58:34.174 --> 02:58:34.834]  See you back tonight.
[02:58:37.748 --> 02:58:42.271]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:58:42.611 --> 02:58:46.694]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:58:46.994 --> 02:58:47.534]  We listened.
[02:58:47.854 --> 02:58:52.837]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:58:53.118 --> 02:58:53.598]  We listened.
[02:58:53.978 --> 02:58:57.020]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:58:57.440 --> 02:58:57.981]  We listened.
[02:58:58.441 --> 02:59:01.603]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:59:01.823 --> 02:59:02.143]  I don't know.
[02:59:28.342 --> 02:59:29.326]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:59:29.346 --> 02:59:30.911]  Not yet available in Iowa.
