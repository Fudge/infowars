[00:00:05.432 --> 00:00:06.092]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:07.813]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.513 --> 00:00:09.633]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.294 --> 00:00:11.094]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.854 --> 00:00:12.774]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.434 --> 00:00:17.175]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:21.717]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.878 --> 00:00:26.158]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:27.837 --> 00:00:32.538]  It's now Thursday, the 26th day of February 04.
[00:00:33.418 --> 00:00:38.740]  I saw The Passion of the Christ last night.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.041]  It was an excellent film and I'll give you my review of it.
[00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:48.782]  In fact, we're going to open the phones up in the second segment of the show here in about seven minutes.
[00:00:49.522 --> 00:00:56.844]  We're going to go right to your calls for those that have seen The Passion or would like to comment on the media spin about the film.
[00:00:57.645 --> 00:00:59.567]  We'll go directly to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:59.587 --> 00:00:59.827]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:12.228]  Just talking to Scott, who's running the show.
[00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:15.869]  He saw a pre-screening of it last night and said he thought it was a great film.
[00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.710]  I mean, there are many movies that are, quote, more violent.
[00:01:21.051 --> 00:01:25.352]  You know, hundreds of people being killed, demons ripping people's guts out.
[00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:28.913]  The passion is historical.
[00:01:28.953 --> 00:01:31.014]  You know, they had a rabbi on television on
[00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:34.296]  Scarborough country going, this is historical.
[00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:38.979]  The Jewish historians, the Roman historians told the same story.
[00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:47.043]  This is what happened to the most famous individual in world history, Jesus Christ.
[00:01:48.484 --> 00:01:52.467]  And that's what the cater nine-tails did to people.
[00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:55.889]  And that's what his body looked like.
[00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:57.630]  That's what happened.
[00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:06.787]  And there were maybe two or three things in there that were license of the writers, Mel Gibson, and the director, Mel Gibson.
[00:02:07.187 --> 00:02:13.728]  You know, there wasn't really a crow there, you know, trying to pull the eyeball out of one of the people on the cross.
[00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:16.429]  But other than that, just a few other things.
[00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.229]  Just amazing film, very moving.
[00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.110]  You don't have a heart if you don't cry.
[00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.850]  I mean, I couldn't help it.
[00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.911]  I just love
[00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.693]  I love Jesus Christ.
[00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:36.618]  But even if I wasn't a Christian, it would have brought me to tears.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.202]  I saw a 3.30 showing.
[00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:40.283]  It was jam-packed.
[00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:41.805]  The entire theater was full.
[00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:44.747]  Not a seat open in there.
[00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.990]  And the numbers are coming in.
[00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.874]  Looks like it made, they're not sure, 18 to 30 million yesterday.
[00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.597]  A record box office opening.
[00:02:58.157 --> 00:03:04.302]  And Mel Gibson says he may make, he told Variety, he may make more biblically based films.
[00:03:05.734 --> 00:03:08.515]  You ought to make one about 70 A.D.
[00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:09.775]  the destruction of Jerusalem.
[00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:14.337]  Or maybe make one in 64 A.D.
[00:03:14.817 --> 00:03:16.077]  or 66 A.D.
[00:03:16.117 --> 00:03:20.479]  with Nero burning Rome and the Christians and the lions and the gladiators.
[00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:23.600]  That would be a powerful film.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.861]  Or a re-do of the Ten Commandments.
[00:03:27.321 --> 00:03:28.962]  Or any of it.
[00:03:29.182 --> 00:03:31.122]  Maybe a re-do of Ben-Hur.
[00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.755]  I don't want to upset the ADL, because I love all those movies.
[00:03:40.658 --> 00:03:43.080]  I will briefly talk a little bit about the film.
[00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:44.622]  Really, you just need to see it.
[00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:48.907]  Words cannot do justice for this film.
[00:03:51.417 --> 00:03:57.840]  And it really encapsulated the fact that if you're doing good and you're standing up against evil, the world is going to persecute you.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:04.283]  And the enforcers, the black ski mask, Nazi, New World Order thugs, enjoy their work.
[00:04:04.363 --> 00:04:05.723]  They hate goodness.
[00:04:06.063 --> 00:04:07.804]  They enjoy torturing goodness.
[00:04:08.464 --> 00:04:11.005]  They enjoy flaying the skin off of people.
[00:04:11.726 --> 00:04:15.988]  They enjoy breaking up families because they're of their father.
[00:04:16.368 --> 00:04:17.488]  They're of the world.
[00:04:17.568 --> 00:04:18.929]  They're of the devil!
[00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.981]  And if you don't believe in the devil, just look around you in this world.
[00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:32.445]  We have wicked people in control, because they don't have conscience, and they enjoy the wickedness, they enjoy the exercise of power.
[00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:36.247]  And by the way, if anybody was the bad guys in this,
[00:04:37.285 --> 00:04:45.531]  You know, the most evil people in the film are clearly the two torturers, the two Romans, who enjoy their jobs.
[00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:48.072]  And then next, you've got the high priest.
[00:04:48.132 --> 00:04:50.314]  And it's biblical.
[00:04:50.334 --> 00:04:55.217]  You know, there's some of the priests, some of the rabbis are against killing Jesus.
[00:04:55.717 --> 00:04:56.818]  So it's historical.
[00:04:57.198 --> 00:04:58.159]  It's an amazing film.
[00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.958]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:05:05.278 --> 00:05:05.619]  Yes.
[00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:08.280]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.701]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:05:10.841 --> 00:05:19.764]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:05:19.844 --> 00:05:27.627]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[00:05:27.847 --> 00:05:30.008]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:37.433]  The 200 pages of our book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Medicine, will remove any anxieties you may have about your nutritional supply.
[00:05:37.613 --> 00:05:41.296]  In this kit, you will receive no monthly bills, no monthly pills.
[00:05:41.456 --> 00:05:43.077]  This is real self-sufficiency.
[00:05:43.177 --> 00:05:58.068]  To get more information about Wheatgrass, the book, seed, and the beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer, go to austinwheatgrass.com or call toll-free 1-877-MY-WHEAT and thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.862]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:03.942 --> 00:06:08.144]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.364 --> 00:06:11.165]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.345 --> 00:06:13.746]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:22.590]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.131]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.331 --> 00:06:28.473]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.473 --> 00:06:29.254]  We're good to go!
[00:06:47.816 --> 00:06:49.478]  Screams and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:49.678 --> 00:06:52.883]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.903 --> 00:06:53.944]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:08.280]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.304]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:07:13.524 --> 00:07:19.169]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.932]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:31.297]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:32.117]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:07:32.157 --> 00:07:35.860]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.541]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:07:38.762 --> 00:07:45.486]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:07:45.706 --> 00:07:50.828]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.868 --> 00:07:51.068]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.088 --> 00:07:54.369]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:54.389 --> 00:07:55.970]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.902 --> 00:08:28.226]  Laying down your life for your brothers, your neighbors, your family, and for strangers is the most beautiful thing you can do.
[00:08:28.827 --> 00:08:39.251]  It takes so much strength and courage, but once you commit yourself to it, it's frankly not that hard.
[00:08:40.348 --> 00:09:01.775]  And instinctively, in the trials and tribulations that I've been through, it is actually rewarding to not sell out, to stand up against evil, and I would be honored someday to be chewed up by the New World Order and in the fight against it.
[00:09:02.895 --> 00:09:05.596]  I mean, when you realize how evil the globalists are,
[00:09:06.583 --> 00:09:29.103]  And what they're doing to the human spirit and humanity, how they institutionalize into the architecture of civilization the dumbing down, the ingraining of true evil into the human system, your very humanity and God's programming should be crying out against it.
[00:09:32.262 --> 00:09:37.185]  Really, I don't have words to describe how deeply moving the passion of the Christ was.
[00:09:37.265 --> 00:09:39.946]  It was more than I thought it would be.
[00:09:39.966 --> 00:09:46.710]  It was very well done, very nightmarish, and at the same time, uplifting.
[00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.971]  And it's very historical!
[00:09:50.052 --> 00:09:57.295]  And I was over at my parents' house having a dinner last night after I saw the Passion, and I wish I would have written the Rabbi's name down.
[00:09:57.375 --> 00:09:57.916]  He was on
[00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:26.805]  Scarborough country, the neocon with beady eyes, but he was a British rabbi, had the hat on, and he was very well-spoken, laying out what a good film this was, how historical it was, according to Jewish and Roman historians, and what good friends Christians were of the Jews, and how stupid it is that all these leftist, New World Order, secular humanist Jews are attacking the movie because they're anti-God.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.760]  I've got to get his name.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.221]  Did anybody get his name?
[00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:35.642]  I tried to find a transcript of it on MSNBC and couldn't.
[00:10:36.122 --> 00:10:40.583]  I want to get him on because he was very, very well-spoken, very eloquent, very intelligent.
[00:10:41.743 --> 00:10:46.484]  There's that other rabbi who was in the Newsday article earlier this week.
[00:10:47.244 --> 00:10:52.265]  It was on Monday, basically saying the same thing, but it was just an amazing film.
[00:10:52.325 --> 00:10:53.365]  You need to go see it.
[00:10:54.345 --> 00:10:57.746]  I saw an article where a group of pastors had bought out a couple theaters
[00:10:58.789 --> 00:10:59.929]  And bought everybody tickets.
[00:11:00.729 --> 00:11:11.671]  And they were going to preach after the film, but after they saw a pre-screening of it, they decided not to do that because there was nothing they could add.
[00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:14.012]  I mean, it's still sinking in.
[00:11:15.012 --> 00:11:16.292]  And I'm kind of a history buff.
[00:11:17.012 --> 00:11:20.913]  I've read what 20 lashes of a cat or nine tail will do.
[00:11:22.893 --> 00:11:26.314]  Jesus got many, many, many, many, many times that, or Yeshua.
[00:11:30.552 --> 00:11:35.035]  Reading what a Caterpillar will do is it will peel the skin off to your ribs.
[00:11:35.815 --> 00:11:38.017]  And yes, that happens in the movie.
[00:11:38.557 --> 00:11:40.158]  And it shocked a lot of people.
[00:11:40.278 --> 00:11:42.339]  But this is what torture is.
[00:11:42.399 --> 00:11:44.721]  This is what evil governments do.
[00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:46.422]  This is what they always do.
[00:11:46.462 --> 00:11:52.325]  That's why I get so upset when I turn on 24, Threat Matrix, NYPD Blue.
[00:11:52.686 --> 00:11:54.367]  Every episode they're torturing people.
[00:11:54.627 --> 00:11:56.148]  The torturers are the good guys.
[00:11:56.972 --> 00:11:58.453]  The tortured deserve it.
[00:11:59.113 --> 00:12:01.095]  We're entering this Roman system.
[00:12:02.456 --> 00:12:06.638]  We're entering something that has been the norm worldwide.
[00:12:06.778 --> 00:12:09.300]  We're entering Satan's system.
[00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:12.402]  And it's happening.
[00:12:12.542 --> 00:12:14.003]  And I'm very upset.
[00:12:14.123 --> 00:12:18.786]  And if you're not angry at evil, again, something's wrong with you.
[00:12:18.846 --> 00:12:20.948]  Your clock isn't working.
[00:12:20.988 --> 00:12:22.789]  Your elevator doesn't go all the way to the top.
[00:12:23.731 --> 00:12:25.939]  You're a few cards short of a full deck.
[00:12:26.220 --> 00:12:28.508]  I mean, you know the cliches.
[00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:54.853]  I mean, if you're not threatened by the mechanized, scientifically crafted, focused, burbling evil that is taking over right now at every level, and if you don't feel your muscles tensing and the hair on the back of your neck standing, and if you don't feel coiled to resist it, and if you're not throwing your weight against this machine, and if you're not trying to awaken others
[00:12:55.933 --> 00:12:59.936]  And in yelling it from the rooftops, you've got a sickness.
[00:13:00.556 --> 00:13:02.197]  And the culture has a sickness.
[00:13:02.617 --> 00:13:08.900]  The Hollywood elite hate this movie because it's wholesome, it's Christian, it's uplifting, it's about sacrifice.
[00:13:09.481 --> 00:13:17.785]  And let me tell you, everything we've got, the civilization we've got, the plenty we have, is because of people putting their lives on the line.
[00:13:18.085 --> 00:13:20.166]  We've got Texas because of the Alamo.
[00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.667]  We've got America because of 1776.
[00:13:23.948 --> 00:13:29.950]  We have the technological developments and advancements we do because of risk and sacrifice.
[00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.331]  That's what builds humanity.
[00:13:32.551 --> 00:13:41.715]  The man who dies, who left something to his family, who stood up for decency, who fought wickedness, who created things, who was loving.
[00:13:43.015 --> 00:13:44.496]  That man or woman wins.
[00:13:44.916 --> 00:13:47.677]  Not the person who has the most toys.
[00:13:47.917 --> 00:13:50.658]  Toys mean absolutely nothing.
[00:13:51.198 --> 00:13:53.139]  Material possessions are only tools
[00:13:53.809 --> 00:13:57.601]  To uplift humanity and to try to reach out to the people.
[00:13:58.022 --> 00:14:00.711]  That's all my material possessions are about.
[00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:03.932]  Okay, I said we'd take a bunch of calls.
[00:14:03.992 --> 00:14:15.441]  If you've seen The Passion, and you love it, hate it, if you've got comments on it, if you haven't seen it but have seen media reaction to it, you can also comment.
[00:14:15.741 --> 00:14:17.843]  But this is what we're talking about right now.
[00:14:18.303 --> 00:14:19.564]  We're talking about The Passion.
[00:14:19.584 --> 00:14:20.405]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:20.425 --> 00:14:20.485]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:14:32.879 --> 00:14:35.680]  And the world hated him, the master.
[00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:37.481]  It's going to hate you, the servant.
[00:14:38.262 --> 00:14:41.343]  And I look at how evil hates goodness.
[00:14:41.784 --> 00:14:45.906]  It'll pass over other wickedness and it goes right after the goodness.
[00:14:46.406 --> 00:14:48.427]  That's because it's threatened by it.
[00:14:49.607 --> 00:14:56.711]  And understand, these wicked people enjoy their work just like those Romans enjoyed flaying Christ's skin off.
[00:14:57.391 --> 00:14:59.833]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Arizona.
[00:15:00.153 --> 00:15:01.053]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:15:01.133 --> 00:15:01.593]  Go ahead.
[00:15:01.613 --> 00:15:02.454]  Morning, Alex.
[00:15:03.454 --> 00:15:09.655]  I think that was probably Rabbi Daniel Lappin, I suspect from your description.
[00:15:13.076 --> 00:15:25.739]  Rabbi Daniel Lappin was in the Daily News article, but he was a gentleman, this was a gentleman on Scarborough Country, and I wish I would have written down his name, but I mean, I agree with everything he was saying.
[00:15:27.359 --> 00:15:31.360]  I watched the movie last night, and I guess I had pretty much the same reaction you did.
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:32.960]  It's just riveting.
[00:15:33.946 --> 00:15:38.210]  And most people were not even looking around them to see other people's reactions.
[00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:48.319]  I think everyone was so teary-eyed and just thunderstruck that it was like they had a spike driven through their guts to the seat.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:50.841]  It was just that powerful a movie.
[00:15:52.545 --> 00:16:03.913]  And it shows us how wicked society is, and in the real world, this is a true story, but in the everyday real world, we see the innocent being persecuted, just like Christ was.
[00:16:04.593 --> 00:16:05.394]  Now why is that?
[00:16:05.494 --> 00:16:07.855]  Why do they persecute the goodness?
[00:16:09.576 --> 00:16:12.798]  Well, that's an age-old question, and I'm not sure I have the answer to.
[00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:21.564]  You brought up something the other day, or started to, about the ADL, and why they so violently object to this movie.
[00:16:25.022 --> 00:16:44.809]  Of course, we understand that they, to some extent, they defend Israel and defend Jews worldwide, except in instances where Jews run counter to their interests, like, as you pointed out, the Second Amendment, where Jews are in favor of gun rights, they will attack Jews as well.
[00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:50.511]  But I think more specifically, the ADL is about being a front for the New World Order
[00:16:51.583 --> 00:17:13.884]  Remember when Reese did the hearings in Congress back in the fifties into the tax-exempt foundations that seemed to be underwriting communism, some of the investigators were amazed to find that they were getting threats from ADL representatives.
[00:17:14.304 --> 00:17:16.006]  And I'm talking death threats here.
[00:17:17.007 --> 00:17:17.968]  Why, you know, why
[00:17:18.823 --> 00:17:22.687]  Are they wondering, did the ADL care about their investigation into these foundations?
[00:17:23.768 --> 00:17:26.570]  These foundations fund the ADL.
[00:17:27.371 --> 00:17:32.896]  The ADL is almost, you know, there's an identity between the... Exactly!
[00:17:33.096 --> 00:17:40.403]  Look, look, anti-Semitism is a horrible label, and the ADL is a rent-a-demonization squad.
[00:17:41.087 --> 00:17:48.611]  And so they love a real Nazi like Arnold because he's pro-New World Order, but then if you fight Nazis and you're anti-New World Order, they come after you.
[00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.271]  Thanks for the call.
[00:17:49.391 --> 00:17:49.931]  Yeah, thank you.
[00:17:50.192 --> 00:17:50.492]  You bet.
[00:17:50.512 --> 00:17:53.333]  We're talking about The Passion, folks, and the response to it.
[00:17:53.673 --> 00:17:54.554]  Don in Indiana.
[00:17:54.594 --> 00:17:55.374]  Don, go ahead.
[00:17:55.974 --> 00:17:56.515]  Yes, Alex.
[00:17:56.655 --> 00:17:57.635]  Hey, thanks for having me on.
[00:17:57.755 --> 00:17:58.095]  You bet.
[00:17:58.516 --> 00:17:59.556]  I'm 23 years old.
[00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:07.360]  Most people I tell about your show, they think I'm crazy, and your show is really an inspiration for me and really keeps me up to date on what's going on in our world.
[00:18:08.621 --> 00:18:21.433]  And my question to you was, you know, every morning on a Monday morning when I watch the news and they tell you how much each movie made for the weekend, the grossing, my question was, do you think that the criminal media is going to obscure the numbers?
[00:18:21.633 --> 00:18:25.196]  Because those numbers that are going to come out for The Passion of Christ are going to be pretty large.
[00:18:26.268 --> 00:18:28.490]  They're not going to be able to obscure the numbers.
[00:18:29.131 --> 00:18:33.735]  Preliminary numbers are between 19 and 30 million for the first day.
[00:18:33.775 --> 00:18:37.238]  They're not sure we should know by this evening.
[00:18:37.378 --> 00:18:44.685]  I hope it makes a billion bucks because that will force Hollywood to stop putting out so much garbage.
[00:18:45.686 --> 00:18:48.728]  It's a reflection of what the people want to see.
[00:18:48.908 --> 00:18:51.551]  It shows Hollywood is really giving us what we don't want.
[00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:52.772]  Exactly.
[00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:53.990]  Exactly.
[00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:56.332]  And people are going to realize that this is a great movie.
[00:18:56.352 --> 00:18:57.673]  A lot of people are going to go see it.
[00:18:57.713 --> 00:18:59.034]  And it's a great witnessing tool.
[00:18:59.494 --> 00:19:00.996]  So many other people will go and see it.
[00:19:01.016 --> 00:19:02.116]  I think it's a great movie.
[00:19:03.217 --> 00:19:03.858]  Did you see it?
[00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:05.359]  Not yet.
[00:19:05.439 --> 00:19:06.660]  I've seen a lot of the trailers.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.841]  I've seen some previews.
[00:19:08.181 --> 00:19:10.523]  And what I've seen is very moving.
[00:19:10.823 --> 00:19:11.123]  All right.
[00:19:11.163 --> 00:19:11.783]  Good to hear from you.
[00:19:11.803 --> 00:19:12.924]  I appreciate your call, Don.
[00:19:13.205 --> 00:19:15.446]  Believe me, folks, you need to see it.
[00:19:16.267 --> 00:19:19.069]  The trailers do not give it any justice.
[00:19:20.126 --> 00:19:24.309]  And I don't suggest you go up and go get a hot dog or popcorn.
[00:19:24.329 --> 00:19:25.450]  Get all that beforehand.
[00:19:27.231 --> 00:19:32.215]  I suggest you bring a package of tissues and just forget the popcorn.
[00:19:34.197 --> 00:19:40.781]  I will come back and talk to Paula and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:19:40.821 --> 00:19:42.142]  Toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:50.861]  And I want to know who that rabbi was on... I don't know why I didn't write his name down.
[00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:52.202]  I want to get him on.
[00:19:52.222 --> 00:19:56.544]  He really was laying it out last night on Scarborough Country.
[00:19:57.325 --> 00:19:57.845]  We'll be back.
[00:20:02.247 --> 00:20:04.008]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.529 --> 00:20:07.950]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:20:08.471 --> 00:20:09.111]  Let's update.
[00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:13.073]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.441]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:20:18.141 --> 00:20:21.422]  Two years ago, the US dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[00:20:21.963 --> 00:20:25.104]  Today, the US dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[00:20:25.504 --> 00:20:27.025]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:20:27.605 --> 00:20:29.606]  January of 2002, gold spot was $2.83.
[00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:36.308]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:20:36.808 --> 00:20:37.549]  Gold is moving.
[00:20:37.809 --> 00:20:38.969]  Equities are treading water.
[00:20:39.369 --> 00:20:42.030]  There's very little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:20:42.570 --> 00:20:43.891]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:20:44.366 --> 00:20:46.088]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:20:46.508 --> 00:20:48.450]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:52.734]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.174 --> 00:20:55.296]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:20:55.696 --> 00:20:55.997]  Call 800-686-2237.

[00:22:00.094 --> 00:22:05.296]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:05.456 --> 00:22:13.539]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:20.861]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:22:21.801 --> 00:22:28.285]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:22:28.485 --> 00:22:33.568]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:22:33.688 --> 00:22:42.574]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:22:42.834 --> 00:22:46.116]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[00:22:59.432 --> 00:23:00.452]  Are you losing your hair?
[00:23:00.793 --> 00:23:02.213]  Is that bald spot getting bigger?
[00:23:02.553 --> 00:23:03.654]  Is your hair looking thinner?
[00:23:04.234 --> 00:23:05.855]  Why aren't you using Avocor?
[00:23:06.075 --> 00:23:10.557]  The hair growth treatment that has helped thousands of people, just like you, regrow their hair.

[00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:18.540]  Thanks to Avocor, my hair is coming back and I couldn't be more excited.

[00:24:01.761 --> 00:24:03.063]  We've had a lot of requests to re-air the
[00:24:16.366 --> 00:24:19.448]  Shrimpton interview concerning the murder of Dr. David Kelly.
[00:24:19.488 --> 00:24:20.768]  I'll do that in the second hour.
[00:24:20.788 --> 00:24:27.652]  Then I'll be back in the third hour, getting into 9-11 commission, being blocked by Hastert, and then that's just on the surface.
[00:24:27.712 --> 00:24:28.572]  It's all theater.
[00:24:29.132 --> 00:24:34.655]  A bunch of economic news that isn't too good, and a lot of New World Order globalist activities.
[00:24:34.995 --> 00:24:41.338]  Continuing with the open phone concerning the passion, let's talk to Susan in Illinois.
[00:24:41.418 --> 00:24:42.359]  Susan, go ahead.
[00:24:42.379 --> 00:24:42.899]  Hi, Alex.
[00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:44.300]  I'm a first-time caller.
[00:24:45.003 --> 00:24:50.484]  I just wanted to say that I encourage the moms and dads out there to take their teenagers.
[00:24:51.124 --> 00:24:56.305]  We took seven teens last night and we had to buy tickets ahead of time.
[00:24:56.565 --> 00:25:06.667]  They were sold out so quickly and I'll tell you this movie affected them more than any other church service or anything that we've ever brought them to.
[00:25:07.127 --> 00:25:10.208]  When we got home we sat around and had a discussion and
[00:25:11.204 --> 00:25:12.345]  It was very moving.
[00:25:12.706 --> 00:25:22.056]  Yeah, the same Hollywood crowd that wants your children to go see the most violent stuff imaginable is going, ooh, don't take even your teenagers to this.
[00:25:22.116 --> 00:25:24.459]  I think you should take five-year-olds to this.
[00:25:25.119 --> 00:25:30.746]  I mean, this is real, this is historical, this is what happens, and the people need to know
[00:25:31.506 --> 00:25:41.511]  And then when your children see cheap, you know, demonic violence, they will know the difference and see violence for what it is.
[00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:52.916]  And maybe when they watch shows like 24, when Keither Sutherland's torturing some woman to death, maybe they'll see him for what he is, a demon trying to sell us the doctrines of devils!
[00:25:52.936 --> 00:25:56.498]  That's right, and my husband was commenting that maybe
[00:25:57.464 --> 00:26:02.368]  A scaled-down version could be made for television so the younger children would be able to see it.
[00:26:02.588 --> 00:26:08.994]  Mel Gibson told Variety he'll never air it on TV because no commercials will be played and nothing will be scaled down.
[00:26:09.574 --> 00:26:10.054]  Okay.
[00:26:10.415 --> 00:26:20.363]  But he is saying... Yeah, it just was a shame that the younger children weren't permitted in, you know, because it was rated R. Well, actually, a parent can take their child to an R-rated film.
[00:26:21.343 --> 00:26:22.344]  Oh, the young ones, too?
[00:26:22.665 --> 00:26:22.945]  Uh-huh.
[00:26:23.145 --> 00:26:27.490]  And now I'm hearing Mormons are being told not to go because it's R-rated.
[00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:30.273]  That's the letter of the law, spirit of the law.
[00:26:30.293 --> 00:26:33.036]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:26:33.737 --> 00:26:36.640]  Well, for all the violence they see on TV and movies,
[00:26:38.215 --> 00:26:44.319]  Well, I mean, you know, that's like saying, look, that's like saying you shouldn't watch a documentary of German concentration camps.
[00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:48.623]  I mean, that's naked, dead, emaciated piles of dead bodies.
[00:26:48.843 --> 00:26:53.446]  That's much grosser and more violent than this movie, but that's okay!
[00:26:53.807 --> 00:26:59.291]  You know, it's okay to show what the Japanese did to our troops, but don't show Jesus.
[00:26:59.651 --> 00:27:01.713]  And this is the New World Order.
[00:27:01.753 --> 00:27:02.393]  Thanks for the call.
[00:27:02.413 --> 00:27:02.894]  Thank you.
[00:27:03.534 --> 00:27:04.634]  Good to hear from you, Susan.
[00:27:04.654 --> 00:27:05.795]  I'm glad you went and saw the film.
[00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:06.495]  Glad you like it.
[00:27:07.355 --> 00:27:09.336]  Let's talk to Heldy.
[00:27:10.176 --> 00:27:11.577]  Heldy in Vermont.
[00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:12.077]  Go ahead.
[00:27:12.097 --> 00:27:13.317]  Hi, dear.
[00:27:13.377 --> 00:27:14.037]  How are you?
[00:27:14.197 --> 00:27:14.498]  Fine.
[00:27:14.878 --> 00:27:15.658]  God bless you.
[00:27:16.058 --> 00:27:17.078]  You're a brave heart.
[00:27:17.458 --> 00:27:19.119]  And so is Mel Gibson.
[00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:19.999]  What a brave heart.
[00:27:20.079 --> 00:27:24.160]  And I want to say, my husband and I and our friends went to see the movie.
[00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:26.101]  We reserved tickets last night.
[00:27:26.781 --> 00:27:30.082]  And Jesus is our Lord and our King and our Savior.
[00:27:30.142 --> 00:27:31.883]  And this movie so depicted that.
[00:27:32.699 --> 00:27:34.300]  It's a real gift from the Holy Spirit.
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:35.541]  Truly magnificent.
[00:27:36.161 --> 00:27:38.763]  And every Christian in our country ought to see it.
[00:27:39.163 --> 00:27:42.345]  And I pray to God that it brings about much conversion.
[00:27:42.445 --> 00:27:43.506]  It gives us great hope.
[00:27:44.067 --> 00:27:46.108]  It's a real shot in the arm.
[00:27:46.821 --> 00:27:47.461]  Absolutely!
[00:27:47.501 --> 00:27:50.422]  And you know, as Christians, we have to stop being ashamed.
[00:27:50.922 --> 00:27:59.963]  They've taught us to have shame while almost every show's about witchcraft and demonology and all this stuff and inhumanism.
[00:28:00.423 --> 00:28:02.104]  And that's what that rabbi said last night.
[00:28:02.124 --> 00:28:08.765]  He said, this film threatens Hollywood because the humanists are taking over and it's the humanists that are pushing the anti-Semitism.
[00:28:09.145 --> 00:28:10.085]  Exactly right.
[00:28:10.285 --> 00:28:11.165]  Exactly right.
[00:28:11.225 --> 00:28:14.726]  And I was talking with our pastor and he said precisely that.
[00:28:14.746 --> 00:28:15.286]  He said, you know,
[00:28:15.979 --> 00:28:32.208]  He said, this movie is a gift from the Holy Spirit, and it's touching hearts, and the New York Times and all these other secular newscasters are having a tizzy fit like the demons were, you know, in the movie, you know, and trying to cast remorse.
[00:28:32.228 --> 00:28:33.008]  Exactly!
[00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:33.949]  Exactly!
[00:28:34.029 --> 00:28:35.570]  We're seeing persecution.
[00:28:35.650 --> 00:28:36.450]  Thank you for the call.
[00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.991]  Well, you're welcome, and God bless you.
[00:28:38.291 --> 00:28:39.172]  Good to hear from you.
[00:28:39.612 --> 00:28:44.695]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Indiana.
[00:28:48.323 --> 00:28:50.384]  I'm doing fine.
[00:28:50.444 --> 00:28:52.965]  I have two quick comments to make.
[00:28:53.486 --> 00:28:57.868]  Number one, as you know, going back to early Rome, it was just
[00:29:00.993 --> 00:29:04.614]  More like early America, but as Rome started to decline.
[00:29:04.714 --> 00:29:05.454]  Oh, that's true.
[00:29:05.774 --> 00:29:14.097]  Rome was very conservative, didn't put up with any garbage, no adultery, no homosexuality, and then they declined.
[00:29:14.157 --> 00:29:14.537]  Go ahead.
[00:29:14.817 --> 00:29:15.517]  Exactly.
[00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:17.517]  And it was rampant.
[00:29:18.298 --> 00:29:21.379]  Rampant, open, homosexuality later.
[00:29:21.399 --> 00:29:24.839]  You've got tyrannical rulers such as Caligula and Nero.
[00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.500]  And unfortunately,
[00:29:27.296 --> 00:29:33.640]  It seems like it's happening here, because now we have violence just for violence's sake on TV.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:42.865]  Yet they'll vilify, as the previous caller mentioned, they'll vilify a movie where violence is for a much greater sake.
[00:29:44.006 --> 00:29:44.506]  Absolutely.
[00:29:44.546 --> 00:29:45.367]  Have you seen the film?
[00:29:45.987 --> 00:29:47.508]  No, I'm going to see it today.
[00:29:47.528 --> 00:29:48.389]  Okay, alright, alright.
[00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:49.469]  More calls coming up.
[00:29:49.489 --> 00:29:50.029]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:52.011]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.471 --> 00:29:53.992]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.985 --> 00:29:57.679]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.805 --> 00:30:01.765]  Is America bankrupt?
[00:30:01.946 --> 00:30:04.507]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[00:30:04.807 --> 00:30:07.288]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?

[00:32:04.551 --> 00:32:05.652]  So much for global warming.
[00:32:05.852 --> 00:32:09.955]  Of course, hand-in-hand with record cold spells, usually go record fuel bills for heating.
[00:32:10.055 --> 00:32:13.017]  But for thousands of people across the country, there's no record fuel bill.
[00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:14.458]  In fact, there's no bill at all.
[00:32:14.618 --> 00:32:21.102]  These people have discovered the magic of a warm workshop without the cost by burning waste oil with a waste oil heater kit from Harold Electric.

[00:32:31.109 --> 00:32:32.510]  The Waste Oil Heater burns clean.

[00:33:06.036 --> 00:33:07.957]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.437 --> 00:33:11.178]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:29.372 --> 00:33:51.360]  And I suggest everyone go and see it to realize not just what Christ did for us on the cross and the type of attitude we should have in standing up against evil and how we should treat our friends and family and those we don't even know, but also the nature of our enemy.
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:57.022]  The nature of the New World Order.
[00:33:58.987 --> 00:34:02.429]  Now, before we go back to your calls, I want to remind you that I've made a new film.
[00:34:02.489 --> 00:34:03.789]  It's called Matrix of Evil.
[00:34:04.229 --> 00:34:13.533]  Some of the best minds in the country, coming from different sectors of the political spectrum, combine in this film to expose an intricate web of deceitful wickedness controlling America today.
[00:34:13.633 --> 00:34:17.195]  Matrix of Evil contains footage from speeches and conversations
[00:34:17.695 --> 00:34:45.789]  With Alex Jones, Congressman Ron Paul, Colonel Craig Roberts, Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, and Frank Morales, which cover and include how the private banks control the military-industrial complex, expert analysis of the USA Patriot Act and the latest police state developments, globalist financial policies pushing America and the world into depression, how the neoconservative movement controlling the Bush administration is nothing more than a Trojan horse for big government agenda of ivory tower social engineers,
[00:34:47.037 --> 00:34:58.988]  The latest revelations concerning cashless society control grid, satellite tracking, cell phone tracking, DARPA surveillance, the end of Posse Comitatus, the federalization of local police and governments, and much more.
[00:34:59.568 --> 00:35:04.633]  Government-sponsored terrorism, gun control, political assassination, September 11th cover-up.
[00:35:05.387 --> 00:35:08.531]  And most importantly, Matrix of Evil is chock full of solutions.
[00:35:09.192 --> 00:35:18.283]  All of the dynamic people interviewed for this film agree that there is a massive awakening taking place in America to the criminal activities of the global elite.
[00:35:18.643 --> 00:35:21.166]  This film is full of documents and archival news clips.
[00:35:21.527 --> 00:35:23.249]  Runtime over two hours.
[00:35:24.818 --> 00:35:33.805]  You need to have Matrix of Evil, you need to have Police State, 3 Total Enslavement, 9-11, Road to Tyranny, Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:35:33.845 --> 00:35:39.790]  The videos are $25.95 apiece, $20 when you order 3 or more of the films.
[00:35:41.732 --> 00:35:42.472]  So don't wait!

[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.421]  All right, let's go to Rick in Tennessee.
[00:36:14.582 --> 00:36:15.242]  Rick, go ahead.
[00:36:15.322 --> 00:36:16.062]  Thank you for holding.
[00:36:16.202 --> 00:36:16.943]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:36:16.963 --> 00:36:17.823]  Thank you for taking my call.
[00:36:18.244 --> 00:36:31.551]  I just wanted to point out for anybody who's saying that the movie is anti-Jew or anti-Roman or anything, that Mel Gibson very craftily depicted an entity, a powerful entity, behind the scenes influencing the torturers and influencing the people.
[00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:34.092]  And I think a lot of people are missing that.
[00:36:34.653 --> 00:36:35.693]  Well, you know, that's a good point.
[00:36:35.713 --> 00:36:39.535]  We know Christ was tempted by the devil, Satan, Beelzebub,
[00:36:41.269 --> 00:36:57.819]  There when he was in the desert for 40 days and 40 nights and up on the mountain, and we know the devil was slinking around and he confronts the devil after he's crucified and comes back and rises again, but in the film they have the devil running things and
[00:36:59.419 --> 00:37:02.100]  I would say the most brutal people in the film are obviously the Romans.
[00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:08.781]  And it just shows how Hollywood, because they hate Christianity, tried to use the label of anti-Semitism.
[00:37:09.101 --> 00:37:10.802]  But I think it's blown up in their face.
[00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:11.842]  Absolutely.
[00:37:12.062 --> 00:37:13.042]  Have you seen the film?
[00:37:13.262 --> 00:37:13.762]  Yes, I did.
[00:37:13.782 --> 00:37:17.863]  Went yesterday, got my tickets two weeks ago, and went to the first showing.
[00:37:18.183 --> 00:37:18.903]  What did you think of it?
[00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:20.283]  Oh, it's awesome.
[00:37:21.184 --> 00:37:27.405]  It makes you realize how much, and there's no way you can repay him for what he did, but it's just how much we owe him.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.102]  For what he went through and what he did for us.
[00:37:32.404 --> 00:37:37.069]  That we could be saved and that we could be, you know, he took the punishment for our sins.
[00:37:37.709 --> 00:37:40.792]  The things that we deserve, what he got, but he did not deserve it.
[00:37:40.812 --> 00:37:43.415]  I don't know, I'm just speechless.
[00:37:43.455 --> 00:37:44.556]  I don't know what to say to it.
[00:37:46.958 --> 00:37:47.839]  I'm speechless too.
[00:37:47.879 --> 00:37:49.000]  Thanks for the call, Rick.
[00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:49.941]  Thank you.
[00:37:49.981 --> 00:37:50.882]  Good to hear from you.
[00:37:50.962 --> 00:37:51.923]  Joe in New York.
[00:37:52.023 --> 00:37:52.764]  Joe, go ahead.
[00:37:53.584 --> 00:37:54.805]  Hey Alex, this is Joe.
[00:37:55.365 --> 00:38:04.052]  You know I called up in the past and I supported everything that you've done opposing the New World Order, and when it comes time, I will throw on my suit of armor and fight right beside you.
[00:38:04.492 --> 00:38:04.832]  Thank you.
[00:38:05.473 --> 00:38:10.516]  I have a couple of comments, a couple of questions, and a lot of this actually even concerns me.
[00:38:11.637 --> 00:38:13.899]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[00:38:13.919 --> 00:38:14.599]  I have all your tapes.
[00:38:14.639 --> 00:38:15.240]  I think they're great.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.784]  I know, but when somebody prefaces a call without you, I'm a big supporter of you, but hey, go ahead and make your points, bud.
[00:38:22.074 --> 00:38:24.515]  Well, I don't want your other listeners to get the wrong idea.
[00:38:24.535 --> 00:38:25.376]  I do support you.
[00:38:26.256 --> 00:38:35.681]  And I've been listening to your show, and a lot of times people do call up and you say you want to stick to the facts, you don't want to talk about hypotheticals, only things that you can prove.
[00:38:35.701 --> 00:38:48.228]  In the whole beginning of the show, I've been hearing this is a historical event, and let me make my whole comment to you, this is a historical event, this actually did happen, when really, Alex, it's always good to have faith.
[00:38:48.348 --> 00:38:49.849]  I do believe in a creator.
[00:38:50.874 --> 00:39:05.429]  However, there really isn't enough documented evidence that I have seen, other than a Bible, that actually supports the theory or the historical life or birth of Christ.
[00:39:05.509 --> 00:39:08.452]  Now let me ask you, hold on, hold on, let me finish please.
[00:39:08.472 --> 00:39:12.816]  Now put him on hold, put him on hold, because you know, we have a dialogue here, and I get to talk too.
[00:39:15.074 --> 00:39:18.337]  That's like saying, I've never seen George Washington, where's the proof?
[00:39:18.377 --> 00:39:27.105]  Or, I've never seen Caligula, but Caligula did live and there were a whole bunch of Jewish historians, Roman historians.
[00:39:27.865 --> 00:39:28.626]  It's a true story.
[00:39:29.289 --> 00:39:40.954]  So just because you haven't bothered to look for the evidence, and don't know about archaeology or history, which I do, more than most people, I could certainly learn a lot more, but I'm interested in these things.
[00:39:41.754 --> 00:39:45.436]  Yes, when I'm covering the news or legislation, I stick to the facts.
[00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:49.558]  Yes, I'm a Christian, because I have faith in what I believe in.
[00:39:49.878 --> 00:39:51.759]  Can you say that that's speculation?
[00:39:52.119 --> 00:39:52.399]  Yes.
[00:39:53.039 --> 00:39:53.419]  Okay?
[00:39:53.979 --> 00:39:56.160]  I mean, clearly, those two things are separate.
[00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.921]  And I don't have a, quote, religious show.
[00:39:58.941 --> 00:40:03.623]  You know, I don't sit here and have secular debates and fights and, you know, get into all this.
[00:40:04.123 --> 00:40:05.524]  I'm talking about the passion.
[00:40:07.024 --> 00:40:08.985]  But now, go ahead now and you can finish up.
[00:40:10.626 --> 00:40:12.606]  Alright, yeah, I can appreciate your comment.
[00:40:13.747 --> 00:40:21.830]  But what I want to say is, do you think for one moment that if a Bible had the power that everyone puts into this book
[00:40:23.106 --> 00:40:29.131]  That the New World Order would give them out for free in every motel so that you can defeat their God?
[00:40:30.252 --> 00:40:37.758]  That book would be in the bottom of the Vatican with a lock on it so tight that you don't even know about that book.
[00:40:41.013 --> 00:40:42.154]  Hey, listen, I gotta let you go.
[00:40:42.174 --> 00:40:46.278]  I gotta let you go because what I said is we're talking about compassion and we're taking calls.
[00:40:46.318 --> 00:40:47.639]  Some other day we can have this debate.
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:53.365]  Or you can call back in the third hour after I rebroadcast this interview because it's a very important interview and we can talk more.
[00:40:55.206 --> 00:41:01.993]  You know, the Gideons paid to have Bibles put in the churches and in hotel rooms and in other places.
[00:41:02.754 --> 00:41:07.357]  And that's what made America free, and that's what made 4% of the population have half the wealth.
[00:41:07.818 --> 00:41:13.601]  Now we're becoming decadent, we're losing the wealth, we're losing the freedom, we're losing the milk and honey, we're going back into bondage.
[00:41:14.802 --> 00:41:15.923]  You reap what you sow.
[00:41:16.984 --> 00:41:23.108]  Even if you're an atheist, the ideas in the Ten Commandments are good ideas to live by.
[00:41:24.509 --> 00:41:25.489]  And we're leaving that.
[00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:28.031]  The people running things don't like that.
[00:41:29.703 --> 00:41:31.464]  And the New World Order doesn't control everything.
[00:41:31.644 --> 00:41:32.925]  They don't control Mel Gibson.
[00:41:33.105 --> 00:41:34.125]  They don't control you.
[00:41:34.205 --> 00:41:34.905]  That's the point.
[00:41:35.125 --> 00:41:36.166]  We have the power.
[00:41:36.406 --> 00:41:38.247]  We can take the planet back over.
[00:41:39.167 --> 00:41:40.568]  That's the point I've always made.
[00:41:41.068 --> 00:41:42.928]  The New World Order is not all powerful.
[00:41:44.509 --> 00:41:51.072]  I've made videos that millions of people have seen because of you airing them on AXS TV and making thousands of copies of them.
[00:41:51.952 --> 00:41:53.572]  I've reached millions of people.
[00:41:53.853 --> 00:41:55.993]  I've done multiple radio interviews this morning.
[00:41:56.173 --> 00:41:57.314]  I'm doing more tonight.
[00:42:00.885 --> 00:42:04.207]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:42:05.547 --> 00:42:06.367]  So thank you, Joe.
[00:42:07.208 --> 00:42:08.989]  Let's talk to Caroline in Colorado.
[00:42:09.009 --> 00:42:10.109]  Caroline, go ahead.
[00:42:10.129 --> 00:42:11.550]  Hi, Alex.
[00:42:11.590 --> 00:42:13.250]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:42:14.191 --> 00:42:26.556]  I just wanted to make an observation of some of the things that I have recorded, you know, like primetime and Nightline and things that have come on about the passion.
[00:42:27.517 --> 00:42:30.318]  And, you know, one of the things with Diane Sawyer,
[00:42:31.152 --> 00:42:36.597]  She made the comment, or gave the statistic, I don't know how reliable that was.
[00:42:38.219 --> 00:42:45.465]  80% of us are Christians, which people say they are, and then she says, and then 20% aren't.
[00:42:45.806 --> 00:42:48.288]  Ooh, we're very diverse, how dare the Christians!
[00:42:48.688 --> 00:42:52.311]  So she takes the numbers, showing we're a Christian nation, and says we're not.
[00:42:52.872 --> 00:42:55.995]  Right, and the comment that I just want to make on that is
[00:42:56.448 --> 00:43:04.251]  You know, you've been talking about the things that are going on in the world today, and particularly in American government.
[00:43:06.311 --> 00:43:22.837]  And, you know, for her to say that, and to say that 80 plus percent claim to have Christianity in their background, and then the way that the media and Hollywood and everything are just obscuring this movie, it's as if
[00:43:23.931 --> 00:43:28.854]  You know, the majority doesn't rule, like we're supposed to be founded on.
[00:43:29.434 --> 00:43:43.162]  You know, the minority, a small minority, just like you've been saying, they have an agenda, they're pushing that agenda, and they're ignoring what the majority... Exactly, and what happens is, in most cases, is the majority
[00:43:43.974 --> 00:43:55.936]  believes the tiny man behind the curtain saying we're all alone, we don't have any power, and you can't fight City Hall, and you can't defeat the New World Order, when that's a parlor trick.
[00:43:57.417 --> 00:44:08.299]  The globalists or the cosmic con artists, they've convinced us, but finally, once enough of us stand up and say we're not listening to your propaganda, we find out we are the majority.
[00:44:08.962 --> 00:44:11.344]  But see, so many people are like cattle.
[00:44:11.484 --> 00:44:17.368]  If they hear that the majority is for something, they go, well then I'm for it, when it wasn't the majority to begin with.
[00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:19.130]  They're selling us evil.
[00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.591]  They're selling us wickedness.
[00:44:20.931 --> 00:44:22.832]  We can defeat this new world order.
[00:44:23.233 --> 00:44:26.555]  But it takes businesses supporting alternative talk radio.
[00:44:26.915 --> 00:44:30.218]  It takes people becoming leaders, starting their own websites.
[00:44:30.578 --> 00:44:33.700]  Starting their own organizations, going to city council meetings.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:39.484]  It takes people becoming aggressive and not just sitting there going, I can't do nothing!
[00:44:39.984 --> 00:44:40.925]  Did you see the film?
[00:44:41.985 --> 00:44:42.426]  I haven't.
[00:44:42.446 --> 00:44:44.727]  We have tickets for Saturday evening showing.
[00:44:45.007 --> 00:44:45.348]  Well, good.
[00:44:45.388 --> 00:44:46.428]  Call me back once you've seen it.
[00:44:46.468 --> 00:44:47.149]  I appreciate the call.
[00:44:47.809 --> 00:44:48.149]  You bet.
[00:44:48.490 --> 00:44:49.470]  Jason in Michigan.
[00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:50.231]  Jason, go ahead.
[00:44:50.251 --> 00:44:50.871]  You're on the air.
[00:44:51.492 --> 00:44:51.992]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:52.292 --> 00:44:52.552]  Yes.
[00:44:53.053 --> 00:44:53.693]  How are you, sir?
[00:44:53.993 --> 00:44:54.273]  Fine.
[00:44:54.814 --> 00:44:55.274]  Good, good.
[00:44:55.294 --> 00:44:59.857]  You know, I saw an interview, actually, of a rabbi
[00:45:01.404 --> 00:45:12.413]  I have not seen the movie yet, but if you could probably point out this scene to your viewers of a lot of Jewish people yelling at Jesus when he was about to be crucified.
[00:45:12.433 --> 00:45:14.254]  Yeah, that's the Bible.
[00:45:15.415 --> 00:45:24.863]  And, you know, comparing that to anti-Semitism I think is wrong because no matter what religion or creed you are, there's going to be
[00:45:25.851 --> 00:45:29.173]  Good people and bad people that want to see that sort of thing.
[00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:35.916]  You can compare it to like an online vote right now if you'd watch Osama Bin Laden executed on television.
[00:45:35.936 --> 00:45:38.637]  I mean, that's just my point that I wanted to make.
[00:45:39.565 --> 00:45:40.786]  Yeah, well that's a good point.
[00:45:41.766 --> 00:45:43.247]  These were the people that wanted him dead.
[00:45:43.307 --> 00:45:44.748]  They ran in there and said kill him.
[00:45:46.009 --> 00:45:49.831]  The film certainly shows that a lot of Jews didn't want Jesus to be killed.
[00:45:50.571 --> 00:45:52.572]  But the establishment did.
[00:45:52.992 --> 00:45:54.533]  The governing council did.
[00:45:55.254 --> 00:45:57.215]  That is, the religious governing council did.
[00:45:58.075 --> 00:45:59.416]  Herod didn't want to kill him.
[00:46:00.909 --> 00:46:02.470]  A pilot didn't want to kill him.
[00:46:02.650 --> 00:46:03.871]  They were like, what's the point?
[00:46:04.731 --> 00:46:07.793]  But the religious leaders were threatened by it.
[00:46:07.833 --> 00:46:08.594]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:09.134 --> 00:46:09.795]  I appreciate it.
[00:46:10.315 --> 00:46:11.356]  Phil in Iowa.
[00:46:11.416 --> 00:46:12.256]  Phil, go ahead.
[00:46:14.378 --> 00:46:14.638]  Alex?
[00:46:14.898 --> 00:46:15.158]  Yes.
[00:46:16.199 --> 00:46:17.080]  You kind of cut out there.
[00:46:17.100 --> 00:46:17.600]  I wasn't sure.
[00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:18.321]  Alrighty.
[00:46:18.361 --> 00:46:18.881]  Well, go ahead.
[00:46:19.802 --> 00:46:28.588]  Well, I haven't seen The Passion, although we are planning on going to see it before we take our children to make sure it's appropriate for our younger teenagers.
[00:46:30.206 --> 00:46:46.179]  I was wondering, Alex, if you were aware, according to an artist's rendition in an American Legion magazine, the new Veterans Memorial for World War II is a Roman triumphal arch.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.401]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.029]  Well, I'd never heard anybody else mention that.
[00:46:52.149 --> 00:46:55.912]  No, I had read that in a magazine that that's what they were going to do.
[00:46:56.193 --> 00:47:00.297]  Yeah, I actually saw that in the American Legion magazine.
[00:47:02.179 --> 00:47:07.704]  You made me think of that earlier in the show when you mentioned how this Roman system was being re-adopted.
[00:47:09.198 --> 00:47:11.080]  Well, that's what the New World Order is.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:14.863]  That's what the black robes are, where the judges and you pray to the court.
[00:47:15.443 --> 00:47:17.565]  In your court pleadings, folks, read the lawsuits.
[00:47:17.605 --> 00:47:19.667]  It'll be, we pray to the court.
[00:47:19.907 --> 00:47:21.288]  That's not the American system.
[00:47:21.588 --> 00:47:26.032]  That's not the Magna Carta that comes from Moses 3,000 years ago.
[00:47:26.292 --> 00:47:31.256]  We are shifting away from that and our common law to Roman civil law.
[00:47:32.497 --> 00:47:33.398]  Civil rights.
[00:47:33.498 --> 00:47:35.179]  This whole system's Roman.
[00:47:35.399 --> 00:47:36.881]  Look at the layout of D.C.
[00:47:38.213 --> 00:47:40.714]  The obelisk, the Egyptian and Roman stuff.
[00:47:40.874 --> 00:47:41.515]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:41.935 --> 00:47:42.635]  Good to hear from you.
[00:47:43.235 --> 00:47:44.996]  Let's talk to Andy in Connecticut.
[00:47:45.096 --> 00:47:45.836]  Andy, go ahead.
[00:47:46.577 --> 00:47:46.897]  Hello?
[00:47:47.237 --> 00:47:47.457]  Yes.
[00:47:47.957 --> 00:47:49.098]  Hi, how are you Alex?
[00:47:49.198 --> 00:47:49.738]  Fine, good.
[00:47:49.818 --> 00:47:50.018]  Good.
[00:47:50.418 --> 00:47:52.939]  Both my wife and I did see the movie yesterday morning.
[00:47:53.079 --> 00:47:53.699]  Good.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.720]  What did you think of it?
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:48:04.624]  Well, we think there was a definite message there, and that is that God wants us to know what Jesus endured for us, so as to prepare us not to deny Him when it's our turn to be tortured for Him.
[00:48:05.825 --> 00:48:07.026]  That's what I got from it.
[00:48:07.206 --> 00:48:09.828]  I am committed to dying in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:48:09.948 --> 00:48:13.831]  I am committed to laying my life down for my brothers and for people I don't even know.
[00:48:13.851 --> 00:48:15.592]  I am committed.
[00:48:15.612 --> 00:48:19.014]  And when we have that attitude, goodness flourishes.
[00:48:19.214 --> 00:48:25.998]  When we're a bunch of cowards, and can't even fight evil because our neighbor might not like us, there's something wrong with us.
[00:48:26.178 --> 00:48:26.399]  Right.
[00:48:26.539 --> 00:48:28.040]  I need to tell you two other things.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:33.063]  Number one, my wife told me that Bill O'Reilly was on The View this morning with Barbara Walters.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:37.922]  And he was actually criticizing the New York Times for criticizing Mel Gibson.
[00:48:39.243 --> 00:48:44.526]  Well that's, you know, it's backfired on all of them so they're having to scurry around right now.
[00:48:44.586 --> 00:48:45.487]  Thanks for the call, Andy.
[00:48:45.507 --> 00:48:46.127]  Thank you.
[00:48:46.167 --> 00:48:46.967]  John in Texas.
[00:48:47.027 --> 00:48:47.688]  John, go ahead.
[00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:48.308]  You're on the air.
[00:48:49.749 --> 00:48:50.750]  Okay, John hung up.
[00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:51.550]  Steve in Florida.
[00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:52.350]  Steve, go ahead.
[00:48:53.251 --> 00:48:54.432]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[00:48:54.492 --> 00:48:55.032]  Am I coming in?
[00:48:55.232 --> 00:48:55.712]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:56.153 --> 00:48:57.513]  I wanted to address the caller earlier.
[00:48:57.533 --> 00:49:00.075]  It sounded like he was from New York or somewhere up there saying that the
[00:49:00.956 --> 00:49:04.818]  The Bible was the only proof that Jesus ever existed according to what he's read.
[00:49:05.278 --> 00:49:09.399]  He's obviously never read Antiquities of the Jews written by Josephus.
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:13.541]  It writes extensively of the time of Jesus and what he did.
[00:49:13.581 --> 00:49:16.782]  And also the Roman Plaintiff spoke of the followers of Jesus.
[00:49:17.403 --> 00:49:24.065]  And a well-known man named Napoleon said, quote, Man I know, and this Jesus Christ I know is no mortal man.
[00:49:24.566 --> 00:49:25.406]  It's all over history.
[00:49:26.503 --> 00:49:37.605]  There were over twenty Jewish and Roman historians, Greek historians, there were at least five historians who saw him, and saw him after he was resurrected.
[00:49:37.925 --> 00:49:41.386]  This is the most documented thing from ancient history.
[00:49:41.746 --> 00:49:47.667]  And what he said about the Bible being buried in the depths of the Vatican is a big joke.
[00:49:47.747 --> 00:49:53.208]  If God wants people to read the Bible, which He does, God is going to let people have the Bible, and that's just out of line.
[00:49:53.248 --> 00:49:54.729]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[00:49:54.769 --> 00:49:55.789]  We've been given the choice.
[00:49:56.477 --> 00:49:58.018]  This film is giving us a choice.
[00:49:58.098 --> 00:49:59.278]  God gives us a choice.
[00:49:59.298 --> 00:50:05.642]  You know, this show is about giving you a choice, so you know what the New World Order is, police, government officials.
[00:50:06.942 --> 00:50:08.703]  You're all being given the choice.
[00:50:08.743 --> 00:50:09.463]  Do you agree with that?
[00:50:09.744 --> 00:50:11.845]  I agree, and you're doing a very good work here, mate.
[00:50:11.885 --> 00:50:17.607]  Bottom line is the biggest choice we have is to accept Jesus Christ as our personal Savior after we repent.
[00:50:18.088 --> 00:50:22.690]  I praise the Lord that you're a Christian, and I praise the Lord and pray for you daily for the work you do for our God.
[00:50:23.103 --> 00:50:25.284]  Well, thank you, and I want to thank everybody out there.
[00:50:26.124 --> 00:50:29.364]  My point is, is that God uses us all to get the truth out there.
[00:50:30.225 --> 00:50:35.966]  And we're all confronted by the truth, as Winston Churchill said, it knocks us all down in our life.
[00:50:36.066 --> 00:50:39.387]  But most of us get up, dust off, and act like nothing happened.
[00:50:39.727 --> 00:50:50.349]  But when I got hit by the truth, like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, when I got knocked off my horse, I saw the light.
[00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:52.770]  I got the religion.
[00:50:53.490 --> 00:50:53.790]  Okay.
[00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:54.651]  We'll be back.
[00:50:54.691 --> 00:50:57.913]  We've got the Shrimpton interview coming up, and then I'll be back live in the third hour.
[00:50:57.953 --> 00:50:58.373]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.975 --> 00:51:06.478]  Whether you live in the country or simply dream about living in the country, Countryside and Small Stock Journal is the magazine for you.

[00:52:02.438 --> 00:52:06.941]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.281 --> 00:52:11.363]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:11.663 --> 00:52:12.224]  We listened.
[00:52:12.524 --> 00:52:17.527]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:17.787 --> 00:52:18.267]  We listened.
[00:52:18.648 --> 00:52:21.689]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.650]  We listened.
[00:52:23.110 --> 00:52:27.171]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:27.551 --> 00:52:28.031]  We listened.
[00:52:28.372 --> 00:52:33.613]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.033 --> 00:52:35.394]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:35.754 --> 00:52:43.156]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:52:43.516 --> 00:52:46.557]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $250.

[00:52:57.498 --> 00:52:58.899]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:05.123]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:05.304 --> 00:53:09.667]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.

[00:54:14.147 --> 00:54:16.368]  Let's get them out there and then move on to the next caller.
[00:54:17.008 --> 00:54:18.609]  Let's talk to Eric in Connecticut.
[00:54:18.689 --> 00:54:19.669]  Eric, go ahead.
[00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:23.010]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call and I'm glad you're feeling better.
[00:54:23.310 --> 00:54:24.071]  You bet, thank you.
[00:54:24.851 --> 00:54:29.953]  I just wanted to remind your listeners that this weekend, this Saturday, at the Castle Cinema up in Providence,
[00:54:30.703 --> 00:54:32.524]  I think it's from 2 p.m.
[00:54:32.585 --> 00:54:33.545]  to 6 p.m.
[00:54:33.665 --> 00:54:37.688]  There will be a showing of one of your videos, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:54:37.728 --> 00:54:38.189]  That's right.
[00:54:38.209 --> 00:54:39.110]  They're going to be showing that.
[00:54:39.130 --> 00:54:42.712]  There's information at the 1320 website.
[00:54:42.872 --> 00:54:45.574]  And I have reservations for me and a buddy to see that.
[00:54:45.915 --> 00:54:47.076]  Well, I appreciate you going.
[00:54:47.336 --> 00:54:50.778]  Yeah, and I'll give you a report when I'm done and when we've seen it.
[00:54:51.139 --> 00:54:54.121]  And I'm looking forward to it and seeing fellow patriots up there.
[00:54:54.361 --> 00:54:58.184]  And I have not seen that particular video, and I'm looking forward to seeing it.
[00:54:58.965 --> 00:55:00.466]  And one other thing, Alex.
[00:55:02.002 --> 00:55:08.104]  It's the longest video, so... Okay, did you know that Mr. Sean Hannity, do you know when he went syndicated?
[00:55:08.124 --> 00:55:09.824]  9-11.
[00:55:10.365 --> 00:55:12.085]  Well, September 10th, 2001.
[00:55:12.245 --> 00:55:26.549]  And I heard a rumor that basically they had a big roundtable before that day, Roger Ailes and all the neocons, and they were basically tipped off and they were told, you tell the truth, your careers are toast, you go along with the line, you're going to make millions.
[00:55:27.748 --> 00:55:33.653]  Yeah, it's pretty obvious what they did, and it's a staged deal, it's a CIA operation, we know that.
[00:55:34.114 --> 00:55:44.082]  They're given their orders, what to do, what to say, how to operate, and Clear Channel owns the voting machines in many areas, and they run the candidates, and they, uh, everything!
[00:55:44.162 --> 00:55:47.325]  They own the media, they own the voting machines, they own the candidates.
[00:55:47.685 --> 00:55:51.889]  Yep, and even on the local paper, I tried to get my local paper to talk about World Trade Center 7,
[00:55:52.788 --> 00:55:55.209]  And one of the editors says, oh, I'm just not interested in it.
[00:55:55.229 --> 00:55:58.571]  And I said, you're not interested in one of the biggest stories of the last hundred years?
[00:55:58.651 --> 00:56:03.513]  Yeah, the owner says we blew it up on national TV, and they can just go, okay, you blew it up, great, thanks a lot.
[00:56:03.773 --> 00:56:03.973]  Yep.
[00:56:04.213 --> 00:56:04.994]  Thanks for the call, Eric.
[00:56:05.014 --> 00:56:05.454]  Okay, Alex.
[00:56:05.834 --> 00:56:06.674]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[00:56:06.914 --> 00:56:08.535]  Let's talk to Mildred in Colorado.
[00:56:08.555 --> 00:56:09.496]  Mildred, go ahead.
[00:56:10.416 --> 00:56:11.196]  Hi, Alex.
[00:56:11.997 --> 00:56:15.418]  I was wondering what your definition of Zionist is.
[00:56:17.579 --> 00:56:21.441]  I've been listening since the first of your show, and you were speaking then of being
[00:56:21.992 --> 00:56:24.454]  Of not being anti-semitic.
[00:56:24.534 --> 00:56:33.903]  That's right, I'm not against... But you spoke of someone who was anti-zionist and you seemed to agree with them, so I just needed to know your definition of zionist.
[00:56:34.443 --> 00:56:40.388]  Well, I'm against, say, Mecha, who says that they hate white people and blacks.
[00:56:40.729 --> 00:56:41.990]  What's Mecha?
[00:56:42.570 --> 00:56:45.613]  Ma'am, just let me answer your question, okay?
[00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:52.122]  I'm against Mecha because they say they don't like certain races and that they're the best.
[00:56:52.722 --> 00:56:56.023]  Okay, I'm against the Ku Klux Klan because they say that about whites.
[00:56:56.824 --> 00:57:06.307]  And Zionists, you know, the real King Daddy, a real Zionist, thinks that they're the best and everybody else is basically dog meat.
[00:57:07.188 --> 00:57:10.289]  And so that's who I'm talking about and most Jews are not Zionists.
[00:57:10.309 --> 00:57:12.190]  So I'm against racist Jews.
[00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:14.030]  I'm against racist blacks.
[00:57:14.070 --> 00:57:15.531]  I'm against racist Germans.
[00:57:16.956 --> 00:57:17.877]  And so that's what I said.
[00:57:18.818 --> 00:57:23.783]  You don't think Zionism means that you support Israel as a nation?
[00:57:23.923 --> 00:57:25.104]  No, that's not what it means.
[00:57:26.025 --> 00:57:30.810]  If you really look at what the real Zionism is, it's a lot more than that.
[00:57:31.170 --> 00:57:36.435]  It means domination by Israel of a certain group of people.
[00:57:37.736 --> 00:57:40.318]  I can have a bunch of rabbis up and tell you that if you'd like me to.
[00:57:40.339 --> 00:57:41.700]  I would like for you to.
[00:57:42.489 --> 00:57:44.871]  Okay, well, you better research what the Zionists say.
[00:57:44.951 --> 00:57:48.313]  I mean, they don't have a very good view of people who aren't Jewish.
[00:57:49.193 --> 00:57:51.595]  It's pretty racist stuff.
[00:57:52.075 --> 00:57:52.716]  Well, thank you.
[00:57:53.056 --> 00:57:54.897]  Hey, I appreciate your call, Mildred.
[00:57:55.257 --> 00:57:57.399]  And, you know, maybe we should have a debate about this.
[00:58:00.345 --> 00:58:06.669]  What I was talking about was this article, Anti-Semitism Charges Causing More Damage Than Film Could.
[00:58:07.189 --> 00:58:15.554]  Two weeks before the opening of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ, online ticket merchants reported that up to half of their total sales were from the film.
[00:58:16.094 --> 00:58:21.097]  One Dallas Multiplex has received and reserved all 20 of its screens for The Passion.
[00:58:21.617 --> 00:58:23.378]  I am neither a prophet nor a movie critic.
[00:58:23.739 --> 00:58:29.322]  I am merely an orthodox rabbi using ancient Jewish wisdom to make three predictions about the movie.
[00:58:30.097 --> 00:58:34.602]  And Daniel Lapin, I totally agree with him.
[00:58:34.622 --> 00:58:35.543]  I'm going to read this later.
[00:58:36.584 --> 00:58:37.665]  This is good stuff.
[00:58:38.566 --> 00:58:39.808]  About what he has to say about it.
[00:58:40.428 --> 00:58:45.234]  I mean, no one would have thought anti-Semitism until the ADL injected this into it.
[00:58:45.894 --> 00:58:48.397]  And now it's going to cause, it probably will cause some damage.
[00:58:48.637 --> 00:58:49.598]  We'll be back with our guest.
[00:58:49.618 --> 00:58:49.999]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.252 --> 00:58:54.734]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:58:54.994 --> 00:58:58.515]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:58:58.595 --> 00:59:02.537]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:59:02.757 --> 00:59:08.919]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:17.243]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:59:17.643 --> 00:59:22.985]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:59:23.145 --> 00:59:26.926]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:27.287 --> 00:59:29.147]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:59:29.207 --> 00:59:31.368]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:59:31.628 --> 00:59:36.850]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:42.132]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:59:45.393 --> 00:59:46.976]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:59:57.486 --> 00:59:58.146]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.807 --> 00:59:59.847]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.567 --> 01:00:01.668]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.328 --> 01:00:03.149]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.909 --> 01:00:04.789]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:09.091]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:13.793]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.495 --> 01:00:24.598]  Alright, my friends, we're now into the second hour of this global transmission against tyranny in defense of liberty.
[01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:41.776]  Coming up later in the show, they're saying they're about to capture Bin Laden, this time out of the mainstream news reports, out of the Sunday Telegraph, out of the Washington Times, and we believe this is going to be a stage capture.
[01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:45.257]  We've been saying this for over two years from my White House sources.
[01:00:46.397 --> 01:00:50.439]  Also, we'll get into anti-Semitism charges causing more damage than
[01:00:51.317 --> 01:00:57.664]  Film could, from a rabbi that wrote a great editorial, Daniel Lappin, that's going to come up later.
[01:00:58.184 --> 01:01:03.990]  Also more on the Rhode Island governor withdrawing their martial law legislation.
[01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:06.853]  He's now apologized and said that he hadn't read the bill.
[01:01:07.434 --> 01:01:09.075]  You see, oh yes, you'd read the bill.
[01:01:09.195 --> 01:01:10.717]  You counted on us not reading it.
[01:01:11.017 --> 01:01:12.819]  Now that we have, you've had to withdraw it.
[01:01:12.879 --> 01:01:13.460]  More on that
[01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:14.761]  Uh, coming up.
[01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:15.802]  Very serious issue.
[01:01:16.402 --> 01:01:20.886]  Also, Supreme Court upholds judges' right to compel medication.
[01:01:21.446 --> 01:01:24.709]  So now we have judges giving other judges police powers.
[01:01:24.769 --> 01:01:25.470]  You gotta love it.
[01:01:26.651 --> 01:01:28.192]  Soviet-style police powers.
[01:01:28.732 --> 01:01:32.235]  Uh, CBS News, years of FBI agent crimes detailed.
[01:01:32.716 --> 01:01:42.684]  Uh, that's coming up later in the broadcast, and I'll also get into some of, uh, well, my comments on Hutton, Hutton Gibson's supposed comments, uh, concerning, um,
[01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:49.985]  Well, some interesting issues, and I do have some comments on this, so that's coming up later as well.
[01:01:51.126 --> 01:02:08.216]  Before we go to our first guest, who I'm honored to have, well, our guest for this hour, I wanted to just remind you that Dr. David Kelly was the head of the Level 4 Porton Down Bioweapons Lab in Wilshire, England.
[01:02:10.553 --> 01:02:13.956]  And he was then the head British weapons inspector who'd been pro-war.
[01:02:14.016 --> 01:02:22.242]  He then came back and leaked information that, look, I'm a hawk for this war, but I'm not gonna lie, Saddam doesn't have weapons of mass destruction.
[01:02:23.442 --> 01:02:25.804]  And Tony Blair misused my assessment.
[01:02:26.445 --> 01:02:28.406]  Well, suddenly he wound up dead.
[01:02:28.506 --> 01:02:30.207]  He told British and U.S.
[01:02:30.267 --> 01:02:34.651]  colleagues that I'm gonna be murdered and found dead in the woods if I don't shut up.
[01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.492]  This is now mainstream news.
[01:02:38.027 --> 01:02:45.874]  Three top doctors have gone public and looked at the autopsy results and say he clearly did not commit suicide.
[01:02:45.894 --> 01:02:52.701]  And we have that posted at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:52.741 --> 01:02:54.723]  So a lot of people are starting to go public on this.
[01:02:56.932 --> 01:03:05.137]  There were rumors of this last week that somebody who'd been inside the British government had sources that said they could confirm that Dr. David Kelly had been killed.
[01:03:05.938 --> 01:03:13.963]  But the folks that got that story, I guess, didn't take time out to go ahead and get in contact with the individual who was bringing forward this information himself.
[01:03:14.083 --> 01:03:14.823]  We've done that.
[01:03:15.184 --> 01:03:19.927]  He's coming up here in just a few minutes and we're so honored to have him
[01:03:20.587 --> 01:03:27.133]  With us here on the show, he's Michael Shrimpton, and Michael Shrimpton has a long bio.
[01:03:27.193 --> 01:03:30.456]  I did some research on him over the weekend.
[01:03:31.477 --> 01:03:36.821]  Michael Shrimpton, of course, is a national security lawyer.
[01:03:36.901 --> 01:03:39.444]  That is Barrister in Government Matters.
[01:03:40.244 --> 01:03:44.648]  He's written for the Journal of International Security Affairs.
[01:03:44.969 --> 01:03:45.549]  He has
[01:03:47.083 --> 01:03:52.770]  Given advice and briefed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
[01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:53.811]  That's the U.S.
[01:03:54.352 --> 01:03:54.713]  Senate.
[01:03:54.793 --> 01:03:59.018]  He's given speeches and consulted all over Western Europe and the United States.
[01:04:00.004 --> 01:04:02.868]  And, of course, he's been an invited guest of the State Department.
[01:04:03.168 --> 01:04:06.072]  So he's a mainstream guy, and I was very impressed talking to him.
[01:04:06.373 --> 01:04:08.455]  We're about to break for a quick three-minute break.
[01:04:08.756 --> 01:04:15.865]  Come back and join a bunch of stations at Cary News during this segment, and I'll briefly recap who our guest is and we'll go to him.
[01:04:16.245 --> 01:04:17.888]  Michael Scrimpton is on the line with us.
[01:04:18.568 --> 01:04:26.053]  Again, we're going to break and come back, and he has some bombshell information for you from his sources inside MI5 and MI6.
[01:04:26.093 --> 01:04:34.818]  Again, he's a national security lawyer, that is Barrister, who has advised the United States Senate Intelligence Committee.
[01:04:36.339 --> 01:04:42.463]  So, you want to have your tape recorders going, you want to call your friends and family and tell them to tune into this show.
[01:04:44.858 --> 01:04:51.307]  One of our great writers, Simon, is going to have an article written for us by this evening that will be posted on the websites as well.
[01:04:54.113 --> 01:04:58.616]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:58.956 --> 01:05:03.059]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.339 --> 01:05:03.899]  We listened.
[01:05:04.199 --> 01:05:09.182]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.463 --> 01:05:09.943]  We listened.
[01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:13.365]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:14.346]  We listened.
[01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:17.948]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:05:18.188 --> 01:05:18.748]  We're good to go.
[01:05:48.301 --> 01:05:56.766]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:56.946 --> 01:06:01.389]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.509 --> 01:06:05.892]  There is a chance to use this disaster in the New World Order.
[01:06:05.932 --> 01:06:07.293]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.193 --> 01:06:09.855]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.807 --> 01:06:33.212]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.412 --> 01:06:38.775]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:43.197]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.217 --> 01:06:43.657]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.677 --> 01:06:45.478]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:53.363]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:54.665]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:06:54.865 --> 01:06:58.269]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:58.369 --> 01:06:58.809]  Phenol!
[01:06:59.130 --> 01:07:06.198]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:07:06.578 --> 01:07:10.621]  PTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:07:10.742 --> 01:07:11.202]  Fragrance?
[01:07:11.562 --> 01:07:16.326]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:21.150]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:07:21.370 --> 01:07:23.933]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[01:07:24.193 --> 01:07:27.596]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:07:27.756 --> 01:07:31.279]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:34.901]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:07:57.471 --> 01:07:58.132]  Big Brother.
[01:07:58.793 --> 01:07:59.834]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.555 --> 01:08:01.617]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.308 --> 01:08:03.128]  You want answers?
[01:08:03.889 --> 01:08:04.809]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:04.829 --> 01:08:09.331]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.631 --> 01:08:13.753]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:18.815 --> 01:08:22.397]  We're going to have an article this evening on the websites.
[01:08:22.717 --> 01:08:26.198]  It'll appear first on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:27.639 --> 01:08:29.880]  And I want to thank Simon
[01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:40.267]  And I want to thank Rowena and I want to thank Paul Watson and all the folks that have been working on this story and for getting us this guest.
[01:08:40.708 --> 01:08:47.994]  And again, he's Michael Shrimpton and a national security lawyer or barrister.
[01:08:48.234 --> 01:08:50.856]  And he's written for major anti-terrorism journals.
[01:08:51.397 --> 01:08:58.002]  He has given his expert advice to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for the U.S.
[01:08:58.103 --> 01:08:58.403]  Senate.
[01:08:58.943 --> 01:09:00.926]  And the bio goes on and on.
[01:09:00.946 --> 01:09:04.850]  He's also been involved in a lot of prominent, high-profile cases in England.
[01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:07.213]  I came across that in my research on him.
[01:09:07.613 --> 01:09:08.755]  And he's a really nice fellow.
[01:09:08.775 --> 01:09:10.076]  During the break, I was talking to him.
[01:09:10.136 --> 01:09:13.440]  I said, you know, I hope you don't end up in the woods like Dr. David Kelly.
[01:09:13.981 --> 01:09:17.044]  And he said, well, no, by going public, you protect yourself.
[01:09:17.345 --> 01:09:18.326]  And that's the truth.
[01:09:18.826 --> 01:09:22.327]  For other government whistleblowers, telling the truth is what protects you.
[01:09:22.667 --> 01:09:25.468]  If you covertly leak something, that's what's dangerous.
[01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:34.850]  So, he protects himself by going on air, and obviously because of all of his sources, he's a great source for all of us.
[01:09:35.790 --> 01:09:38.150]  And Michael, good to have you on the show with us.
[01:09:41.191 --> 01:09:41.651]  Good day.
[01:09:42.952 --> 01:09:44.492]  Just for folks,
[01:09:45.373 --> 01:09:48.875]  Around the world who aren't very familiar with Dr. David Kelly.
[01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.075]  Hard to believe people aren't.
[01:09:50.655 --> 01:10:02.200]  Can you recap who he was, what happened to him, and then from your sources, you even know down to the specifics of how they killed him, and from your sources, who was behind the killing.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.361]  Can you just go through it for us?
[01:10:03.801 --> 01:10:11.465]  Yes, David Kelly was probably the most respected microbiologist in the United Kingdom, certainly one who specialised in weapons of mass destruction.
[01:10:12.205 --> 01:10:16.928]  He was the head of our main WMD laboratory at Porton Down in Wiltshire.
[01:10:17.726 --> 01:10:24.811]  He was very involved in the dismantling, verification of the dismantling of the Soviet WMD programs after the end of the Cold War.
[01:10:25.572 --> 01:10:30.755]  He spent some time inside the bad old USSR.
[01:10:31.796 --> 01:10:37.340]  He was the senior British inspector on UNSCOM, the UN mission inside Iraq.
[01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:41.372]  He spent some considerable time in Baghdad.
[01:10:42.092 --> 01:10:52.299]  He was working very closely with our overseas intelligence service, MI6, or the Secret Intelligence Service, and he was a major, high-value British intelligence asset.
[01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:52.900]  He was a good man.
[01:10:53.460 --> 01:10:57.402]  Decorated, awarded the CMG, Commander of St.
[01:10:57.422 --> 01:10:57.943]  Michael and St.
[01:10:57.963 --> 01:11:00.204]  George, and highly regarded.
[01:11:00.745 --> 01:11:05.688]  And well liked, too, within the British intelligence community, and also respected in the United States.
[01:11:07.432 --> 01:11:17.694]  And then suddenly Tony Blair smearing him in the press and he ends up dead and the witnesses according to the London Times and their publications saw four men in black uniform standing around him.
[01:11:18.054 --> 01:11:20.195]  They run off and oh, it's a suicide.
[01:11:21.315 --> 01:11:29.856]  Go over the whole controversy of, I mean, Dr. David Kelly was a hawk for the war but he wasn't going to put out false intelligence.
[01:11:30.697 --> 01:11:32.517]  Go through that for folks that missed out on it.
[01:11:32.937 --> 01:11:52.112]  Well yes, David Kelly briefed in a British BBC journalist called Andrew Gilligan, and also spoke to another journalist for the BBC television's Newsnight programme, and he briefed in both journalists along the line that the case for, the WMD case for war with Iraq had been exaggerated.
[01:11:52.132 --> 01:11:54.734]  There's a lot of dispute about exactly what was said and what wasn't said.
[01:11:55.986 --> 01:12:05.715]  The BBC Today programme, which is the leading radio current affairs programme, led with a story from Andrew Gilligan, which didn't name David Kelly as Andrew's source.
[01:12:06.375 --> 01:12:14.702]  Now, we know that David Kelly was, and my own intelligence sources confirmed that before the BBC itself confirmed it on Sunday the 20th of July.
[01:12:15.723 --> 01:12:18.005]  David Kelly was outed in the media.
[01:12:18.466 --> 01:12:22.289]  Big dispute as to who authorised his name to be given to the media.
[01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:26.695]  And he was asked to appear before a committee in the House of Commons.
[01:12:26.815 --> 01:12:34.706]  There was a lot of controversy about what the government had been told, how truthful a dossier that they had prepared on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was.
[01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:41.698]  And shortly after he gave evidence to the House of Commons, he was found dead on Friday 18th of July of last year.
[01:12:42.418 --> 01:12:43.218]  He was found dead.
[01:12:43.678 --> 01:12:46.259]  There is a dispute about exactly where he was found.
[01:12:46.499 --> 01:12:58.103]  According to the official version of events, he was found dead in a copse or a wood at a place called Harrowdown Hill between the village where he lived and the River Thames.
[01:12:59.781 --> 01:13:07.987]  But the forensic tents, it's noticeable, Alex, that the forensic tents that were set up by the local police force, Thames Valley Police, were actually set up in the field.
[01:13:08.908 --> 01:13:18.755]  Why you would have someone killed in the woods and have the police tent over the scene of the crime set up in the field, no one has yet been able to explain to my satisfaction.
[01:13:19.675 --> 01:13:28.702]  Now, the government were blamed for causing the death, but the way the government were criticised was this.
[01:13:29.252 --> 01:13:32.094]  That they had caused his name to be leaked to the media.
[01:13:32.314 --> 01:13:36.396]  That had put him under intolerable pressure and he had allegedly committed suicide.
[01:13:36.416 --> 01:13:44.801]  The initial media reports all went with suicide and the mainstream media in the UK is still reporting it as a suicide.
[01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:53.085]  The government responded very quickly and brought in a law lord, Lord Hutton, who had previously been Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland.
[01:13:53.866 --> 01:13:57.348]  And the Hutton Inquiry has very recently reported that Lord Hutton
[01:13:57.987 --> 01:14:00.509]  Didn't challenge the suicide verdict.
[01:14:01.329 --> 01:14:06.392]  There was no cross-examination of witnesses before the Hutton Inquiry as to the cause of death.
[01:14:07.053 --> 01:14:13.316]  It was assumed that it was suicide and the BBC were essentially blamed for poor reporting.
[01:14:13.356 --> 01:14:14.337]  The government were let off the hook.
[01:14:15.018 --> 01:14:18.800]  The Hutton Report, I'm sorry to say, is widely seen as a whitewash, and it's been rubbished.
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:33.589]  A very senior British intelligence officer recently retired, a lieutenant colonel, Crispin Black, who was on the Defence Intelligence staff until 2002, has basically described the report as a laughingstock, and I respectfully agree.
[01:14:33.869 --> 01:14:38.351]  Yeah, I've seen major polls where over two-thirds of British people believe it's complete fraud.
[01:14:38.371 --> 01:14:44.114]  I mean, obviously, Tony Blair hires one of his cronies to come in and say, oh, you didn't do anything wrong.
[01:14:44.974 --> 01:14:55.119]  And then even that's a whitewash of a larger whitewash, because obviously, according to the medical reports, the coroner's report, the doctors that have looked at it,
[01:14:56.565 --> 01:15:04.470]  The suicide verdict, that's a fraud itself, and let's go into your sources and what really happened to Dr. David Kelly.
[01:15:04.770 --> 01:15:08.132]  Absolutely, although I wouldn't be allowed to say that Tony Blair had hired a judge.
[01:15:08.352 --> 01:15:12.955]  You understand that in England we don't hire judges.
[01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:21.359]  The judge is on the state payroll anyway, and I wouldn't want to be thought of as suggesting that anybody had put a little extra funds Lord Hutton's way.
[01:15:21.399 --> 01:15:24.001]  I'm quite sure Lord Hutton took no extra payment.
[01:15:24.525 --> 01:15:30.110]  Well, what I'm saying is that obviously Hutton's been involved in what's been called whitewashes in the past.
[01:15:31.411 --> 01:15:36.476]  The report, I'm sorry to say, with respect to Lord Hutton, the report is a complete whitewash.
[01:15:36.676 --> 01:15:41.820]  Well, I mean, you have a government institution whitewashing for another government institution.
[01:15:42.141 --> 01:15:42.721]  Well, exactly.
[01:15:42.821 --> 01:15:46.084]  And this is the problem with appointing senior judges to hold inquiries.
[01:15:46.144 --> 01:15:47.946]  There's been a lot of adverse comment in England.
[01:15:49.187 --> 01:15:51.911]  The senior judge is, by definition, part of the establishment.
[01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.132]  It's very difficult.
[01:15:53.213 --> 01:15:58.600]  It's very difficult for the judge, of course, because if he whitewashes the government, everybody says, well, it is a whitewash.
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:05.128]  If he blames the government, well, he's asking too much of a senior judge to go around blaming the government.
[01:16:05.168 --> 01:16:06.390]  It's not what senior judges do.
[01:16:06.710 --> 01:16:07.791]  I mean, what do you expect?
[01:16:07.871 --> 01:16:12.096]  I mean, here we have it where Janet Reno hires somebody to investigate Waco.
[01:16:12.737 --> 01:16:15.821]  I mean, she literally appoints the investigator.
[01:16:16.281 --> 01:16:18.945]  We have Bush controlling the 9-11 panel.
[01:16:18.965 --> 01:16:20.586]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:16:21.447 --> 01:16:26.794]  But getting into the specifics of Dr. David Kelly's clear murder, let's go over that.
[01:16:27.154 --> 01:16:27.795]  Well, absolutely.
[01:16:27.835 --> 01:16:31.819]  Now, on Saturday 19th of July, David was murdered on the 17th.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:42.692]  On Saturday the 19th, within 48 hours of the murder, I was contacted by a British intelligence officer who had told me he'd been murdered.
[01:16:42.772 --> 01:16:43.933]  I didn't take it by surprise.
[01:16:44.013 --> 01:16:46.216]  I was suspicious of the suicide theory from the word go.
[01:16:46.914 --> 01:16:59.282]  Now that source told me he'd done some digging and discovered that, he didn't name names, but he discovered that it had been known about in Whitehall prior to the 17th of July that David Kelly was going to be taken down.
[01:16:59.302 --> 01:17:04.325]  Now normally with a suicide, Alex, you appreciate we don't like people knowing in advance.
[01:17:04.825 --> 01:17:09.007]  If people know in advance of the death, that normally points away from suicide.
[01:17:09.408 --> 01:17:09.708]  Yes.
[01:17:10.068 --> 01:17:11.969]  I have.
[01:17:12.009 --> 01:17:12.389]  Exactly.
[01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:20.684]  A lot of work has been done since the murder, and there's been particularly a great deal of medical research.
[01:17:21.104 --> 01:17:23.005]  Now, it's absolutely clear that David was murdered.
[01:17:23.085 --> 01:17:25.747]  The suicide theory just doesn't hold water at all.
[01:17:26.547 --> 01:17:31.270]  The official version of events is that he took some Coproxamol tablets.
[01:17:31.330 --> 01:17:36.493]  Now, Coproxamol is available in England only by prescription.
[01:17:37.911 --> 01:17:44.037]  There is a problem with that, because there is no evidence that David Kelly was ever prescribed Coproxamol.
[01:17:44.477 --> 01:17:47.020]  Now, Coproxamol, I think, is available in the United States.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:53.065]  It's a combination of dextropropothene and paracetamol in a ratio of 1 to 10.
[01:17:54.146 --> 01:18:03.294]  It's not a very powerful painkiller, and the level of Coproxamol in the bloodstream, according to the official toxicology report, was about 1 third, i.e.
[01:18:03.374 --> 01:18:04.075]  not enough to kill him.
[01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:12.725]  Now, 29 tablets were allegedly missing, or were missing, from a packet of Coproxamol found by the body.
[01:18:13.465 --> 01:18:18.467]  The problem is that there is only one-fifth of a tablet in the stomach and there's no evidence of substantial vomiting.
[01:18:19.247 --> 01:18:24.709]  There is a little bit of vomit found on the body, but not much, and there's no analysis done of the material.
[01:18:26.049 --> 01:18:32.431]  The stomach contents do not support the suggestion that he ingested 29 Coproxamol tablets.
[01:18:35.473 --> 01:18:53.138]  Interestingly, the initial media reports, and when we look at staged suicides or political assassinations, I find it very useful to concentrate on the early media reports, because if there is a cover-up, usually the cover-up kicks in after 12, 24, 36 hours.
[01:18:53.198 --> 01:18:58.779]  The first media reports are very often the most accurate, particularly if they're coming from local news organisations.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.581]  And the early media reports make no mention of a bottle of water.
[01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:17.337]  In theory is, Alex, that he took these co-proximal tablets, having set out on a walk in the course of which he was going to commit suicide, and took with him a bottle of water to swallow the tablets.
[01:19:17.977 --> 01:19:21.880]  Problem, no mention in early media reports of any bottle of water.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:32.186]  That detail was only added in after a group of concerned people in England, professionals called the Kelly Group, had made the point, and it was already out into the open,
[01:19:33.348 --> 01:19:35.589]  Now, the suicide version of it can't be right.
[01:19:36.309 --> 01:19:42.832]  He was found with one wrist slashed, and the ulnar artery, which is the artery near... Tell you what, we've got a break.
[01:19:42.852 --> 01:19:51.436]  We're going to come back and go over the circumstantial evidence, and then your sources inside intelligence that say, hey, we got the word, he was about to be killed, and then who killed him?
[01:19:51.476 --> 01:19:52.476]  We'll talk about that too.
[01:19:53.176 --> 01:19:56.258]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.758 --> 01:19:58.759]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[01:19:59.119 --> 01:20:01.620]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[01:20:02.065 --> 01:20:06.606]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[01:20:06.826 --> 01:20:08.566]  But you have to act now!
[01:20:08.786 --> 01:20:15.008]  We have $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I have seen in my 24 years in the business.
[01:20:15.388 --> 01:20:21.909]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:25.690]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[01:20:25.930 --> 01:20:29.331]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[01:20:29.798 --> 01:20:32.079]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[01:20:32.439 --> 01:20:33.260]  Do it now.
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.721]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[01:20:36.121 --> 01:20:41.684]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins at the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business.
[01:20:41.744 --> 01:20:42.885]  Call Midas Resources.
[01:20:42.905 --> 01:20:43.345]  800-686-2237.

[01:21:08.912 --> 01:21:09.513]  I think so.
[01:21:29.195 --> 01:21:29.576]  I think so.
[01:21:51.218 --> 01:21:53.179]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:21:53.259 --> 01:22:03.985]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:22:04.346 --> 01:22:08.888]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:22:08.948 --> 01:22:20.295]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:22:20.875 --> 01:22:27.720]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.241]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:22:30.742 --> 01:22:35.705]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:22:36.005 --> 01:22:42.328]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:23:59.158 --> 01:24:00.698]  Alright, this is a quick segment.
[01:24:00.738 --> 01:24:02.139]  We've got a longer segment coming up.
[01:24:02.199 --> 01:24:04.479]  Plenty of time to go over this evidence with our guests.
[01:24:04.679 --> 01:24:11.521]  And our guests would like to take calls, so later in the interview, if you'd like to talk to our guests, the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:11.541 --> 01:24:11.601]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:24:11.621 --> 01:24:13.262]  Now, we're talking to Michael Shrimpton.
[01:24:21.776 --> 01:24:24.060]  And he's a national security barrister in England.
[01:24:24.861 --> 01:24:32.053]  He has given testimony and advice to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for the U.S.
[01:24:32.113 --> 01:24:32.414]  Senate.
[01:24:33.141 --> 01:24:39.506]  And he's obviously very knowledgeable about intelligence and the activities of intelligence agencies.
[01:24:39.787 --> 01:24:42.269]  He has a lot of sources in MI5 and MI6.
[01:24:42.729 --> 01:24:53.238]  You just heard him talk about one source inside British Intelligence that said they got word that Kelly was about to be killed by the government a week or so before he actually died.
[01:24:53.278 --> 01:24:56.801]  I want to go back into that in more detail coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:24:59.073 --> 01:25:08.936]  Mr. Shrimpton was then going over the material evidence of the murder, and you'd gotten to the point of the slitting of the wrist.
[01:25:09.777 --> 01:25:12.417]  Yeah, he clearly didn't slit his own wrist.
[01:25:12.758 --> 01:25:22.741]  The idea that he exsanguinated, that he died from hemorrhaging, he bled out from a cut to one wrist only, to the ulnar artery is just nonsense, Alex.
[01:25:23.653 --> 01:25:27.877]  Firstly, the artery that was cut was the ulnar artery, which is more difficult to reach.
[01:25:27.937 --> 01:25:29.539]  It's on the little finger side of the hand.
[01:25:29.939 --> 01:25:31.341]  It's deeper than the radial artery.
[01:25:32.101 --> 01:25:39.388]  Why go for an artery deep in the wrist when you can slit an artery much closer to the surface of the skin?
[01:25:40.049 --> 01:25:40.810]  That's the first problem.
[01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:48.037]  Second problem, he, according to the autopsy report, he severed or transected the artery
[01:25:48.703 --> 01:25:52.206]  But once you transect an artery, we have something called vasoconstriction.
[01:25:52.566 --> 01:25:55.149]  The artery retracts and that promotes clotting.
[01:25:55.289 --> 01:25:59.292]  It's very difficult to bleed out if you sever one artery only.
[01:25:59.853 --> 01:26:09.841]  And I would second that with David Halpin, a doctor, a trauma and orthopedic surgeon, as well as Stephen Frost, specialist in diagnostics.
[01:26:10.321 --> 01:26:14.325]  I mean, there's a whole bunch of top-level doctors saying this is a complete fraud.
[01:26:14.565 --> 01:26:14.966]  Exactly.
[01:26:15.346 --> 01:26:21.372]  One doctor went around promoting the official version of events and attacked these doctors in the Guardian newspaper in England and talked about slashing wrists.
[01:26:21.872 --> 01:26:26.357]  Well, David Kelly on the official version of events didn't slash his wrists, plural.
[01:26:26.777 --> 01:26:27.958]  He slashed one wrist only.
[01:26:28.338 --> 01:26:29.460]  It's highly unusual.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:33.624]  Firstly, wrist slashing is not an effective method of committing suicide.
[01:26:34.685 --> 01:26:39.069]  One of the reasons people do it in a bath of hot water is that it keeps the temperature high.
[01:26:39.665 --> 01:26:40.385]  Yeah.
[01:26:40.485 --> 01:26:47.607]  If you're out in the open, if you're not keeping the temperature high, the arteries will not stay dilated.
[01:26:48.487 --> 01:26:53.108]  It is very difficult indeed to bleed out in the open, even if you slit both wrists.
[01:26:54.149 --> 01:27:00.650]  Slitting one wrist only, much less blood loss, and we have conflicting accounts of the amount of blood found by the body.
[01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:07.032]  The most reliable eyewitnesses in my judgement are probably the paramedics who found him.
[01:27:08.382 --> 01:27:10.324]  They talk about comparatively little blood loss.
[01:27:10.904 --> 01:27:16.208]  There is no solid evidence that a lot of blood had left the body.
[01:27:16.228 --> 01:27:20.251]  There were no adequate measurements of the amount of blood left in the major vessels in the heart and so on.
[01:27:20.491 --> 01:27:29.638]  Now, talking to you earlier today, it's pretty clear that they drug him up, then as he's dying, slit his wrist to create this scene.
[01:27:30.599 --> 01:27:35.062]  From your sources inside the intelligence community, what really happened to Dr. David Kelly?
[01:27:35.669 --> 01:28:02.343]  Well, in my judgment, based on conversations with sources and with medical experts, and a great deal of work has been done over this since the murder, he was probably murdered by a combination of an injection, not through tablets, but an intravenous injection of dextropropoxyphene and paracetamol, the constituents of coproxamol, and a muscle relaxant called succinylcholine.
[01:28:03.144 --> 01:28:06.107]  Succinylcholine is a favourite method of assassinating people.
[01:28:06.147 --> 01:28:10.592]  It's used by intelligence agencies, particularly the French DGSE.
[01:28:11.513 --> 01:28:19.421]  Succinylcholine, although it's used therapeutically for treating, facilitating intubation and so on, can be lethal.
[01:28:20.146 --> 01:28:27.656]  And in combination with the constrictions of coproxamol, 30 mg would probably have been a lethal dose.
[01:28:28.197 --> 01:28:36.068]  The problem for someone investigating an assassination by succinylcholine is that it metabolizes even after death.
[01:28:36.841 --> 01:28:38.682]  And you only pick up the metabolites.
[01:28:38.882 --> 01:28:47.346]  In other words, it's one of those drugs that leaves no trace, unless you have a very expert pathologist who really knows what he or she is doing.
[01:28:47.586 --> 01:28:51.208]  Now, all you can find is what it metabolizes into.
[01:28:51.228 --> 01:28:53.249]  You cannot find the original chemical.
[01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:54.049]  Exactly.
[01:28:54.169 --> 01:28:57.371]  So you have to look for the enzymes it metabolizes into.
[01:28:58.051 --> 01:28:59.792]  You won't find any trace of the original drug.
[01:29:00.032 --> 01:29:01.213]  Well, it's like with AIDS.
[01:29:01.233 --> 01:29:05.935]  You look for the antibodies, because you can't find the virus.
[01:29:06.115 --> 01:29:06.995]  Well, very effectively, yeah.
[01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:13.337]  And it's fairly clear that the slash to the wrist was done to disguise the puncture wound.
[01:29:13.397 --> 01:29:17.157]  There's no puncture wound, but of course the slash to the wrist would have disguised it.
[01:29:17.598 --> 01:29:24.979]  Now the palmar face, or the palmar face of the wrist, effectively the inside face of the wrist, is a very popular method.
[01:29:25.079 --> 01:29:28.660]  You know, knee physiologists would use it to inject.
[01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:33.181]  It's quite realistic to suppose that David Kelly was injected in the wrist.
[01:29:34.121 --> 01:29:38.363]  We've got a break again.
[01:29:38.403 --> 01:29:41.524]  We'll come back and get into your sources and take some calls.
[01:29:43.225 --> 01:29:44.125]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.626 --> 01:29:46.206]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:46.226 --> 01:29:49.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.167 --> 01:29:56.387]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:29:56.808 --> 01:30:01.169]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:30:01.449 --> 01:30:07.250]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:30:07.490 --> 01:30:11.531]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:30:11.811 --> 01:30:17.452]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:30:17.572 --> 01:30:20.193]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:30:22.293 --> 01:30:25.814]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 mounts.
[01:30:25.934 --> 01:30:28.614]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.

[01:32:49.057 --> 01:32:51.519]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[01:32:53.981 --> 01:32:56.703]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:32:56.723 --> 01:33:00.667]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:05.911]  Folks, this is very, very important.
[01:33:07.933 --> 01:33:11.316]  Because Tony Blair is a minion of the globalists.
[01:33:12.225 --> 01:33:24.352]  He's the tool who's trying to destroy British national sovereignty, to bring the British people under the dominance of the unelected, unaccountable European Union, whether they like it or not.
[01:33:24.992 --> 01:33:34.477]  He's been promised the EU headship under a new, expanded, empowered EU, if he can get Britain into it.
[01:33:35.218 --> 01:33:37.279]  He lied about the weapons of mass destruction.
[01:33:38.236 --> 01:33:48.123]  It's clear that if Tony Blair was to have been exposed, that would certainly hurt those in Europe that want to get rid of British sovereignty.
[01:33:48.904 --> 01:34:03.194]  And talking to Michael Shrimpton, our guest, our intelligence expert, who has his sources over there in England, talking to you earlier before the show, you talked about your sources, the evidence you have that
[01:34:04.554 --> 01:34:18.159]  It looks like that it was elements of British intelligence or of the government using French intelligence to go and do their dirty work, which by the way is a standard operation.
[01:34:18.559 --> 01:34:25.121]  If intelligence agencies are getting rid of some of their own people, they will generally use a sister agency in a sister country.
[01:34:26.962 --> 01:34:32.804]  I know this is very delicate, Michael, but can you go over what you talked to me off-air about?
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:34.621]  Yes, Alex.
[01:34:35.061 --> 01:34:45.467]  Firstly, I should make it clear, I have absolutely no indication that anybody in either of the British intelligence agencies, MI5, the Security Service, or MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service, is being involved.
[01:34:45.767 --> 01:34:50.730]  On the contrary, my sources are telling me that both services are extremely unhappy.
[01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:54.993]  Now, the indications are, and you understand I'm being cautious, aren't I?
[01:34:55.778 --> 01:35:04.107]  There are indications pointing towards an involvement by the French External Intelligence Agency, the DGSE, or Direction Générale de la Sécurité Exterieure.
[01:35:04.347 --> 01:35:07.750]  But obviously they've got a liaison within the government, the British government.
[01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:10.253]  They've got to have someone authorizing this.
[01:35:10.293 --> 01:35:14.297]  Are you saying it's just a rogue element wanting to get rid of somebody who can mess up the EU?
[01:35:14.737 --> 01:35:14.937]  No.
[01:35:15.257 --> 01:35:28.402]  Again, I've got to be obviously careful on air, but the indications are that the tasking for the assassination came from within the UK, but I can't name any individual official or minister.
[01:35:29.282 --> 01:35:40.126]  The tasking was generated in the UK, went to Paris, was then OKed in Paris, and on the information available to me, the operational agency for the assassination was DGSE.
[01:35:41.269 --> 01:36:04.993]  Now, there are also indications, and I'm, again, obviously Alex, you appreciate I'm expressing myself with caution here, there are indications that DGSE, in order to false flag the assassination, should their team be discovered, used Iraqi intelligence assets from the Iraqi Muqabirat Agency that were available in Damascus after the fall of Baghdad.
[01:36:05.729 --> 01:36:23.918]  And I have one source suggesting that an Iraqi team, that's to say, an ex-Muqabirat team recruited in Damascus with the assistance of the Syrian intelligence operation, also the Muqabirat, were flown into Corsica in the seven days prior to the assassination of David Kelly.
[01:36:24.591 --> 01:36:34.521]  Now the standard French practice when they carry out assassinations is to take their own team out and I am very doubtful that any of the people involved directly in the assassination of David Kelly are still alive.
[01:36:34.541 --> 01:36:39.806]  It would be highly unusual for French to permit anyone involved in an assassination for them to
[01:36:41.548 --> 01:36:43.629]  Well, we've seen this in the past.
[01:36:43.649 --> 01:36:54.237]  You've had the big controversy the BBC's reported on about the British intelligence using Al-Qaeda individuals to try to kill Muammar Gaddafi.
[01:36:54.257 --> 01:36:55.978]  I mean, this is a classic deal.
[01:36:56.018 --> 01:37:05.345]  Of course, the Iraqis were allies during the 80s, and so a lot of these guys were trained in the US, trained in England, trained in France, and then bringing these assets back in.
[01:37:06.526 --> 01:37:09.848]  Yeah, that was a mess.
[01:37:09.969 --> 01:37:12.251]  We could spend another hour on that, Alex.
[01:37:13.111 --> 01:37:16.875]  Whoever authorised that operation did not know what they were doing.
[01:37:16.895 --> 01:37:18.316]  That was just a total shambles.
[01:37:19.034 --> 01:37:27.540]  Well, I mean, wouldn't these Iraqis know that they were doing this hit, that they were going to be in deep trouble afterwards, or were they told, you don't have a choice?
[01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:28.640]  Not necessarily.
[01:37:28.661 --> 01:37:30.902]  They may not have worked for French Intelligence before.
[01:37:31.082 --> 01:37:35.285]  If you were offered a job by French Intelligence, I would turn it down.
[01:37:35.325 --> 01:37:44.451]  If I could advise anybody approached by French Intelligence to do a hit, I would strongly advise them to turn it down or increase their life insurance.
[01:37:44.978 --> 01:38:02.836]  They were probably, I mean, assuming it was Iraqis, and I can't be positive, there are indications pointing towards an Iraqi involvement, I can't be positive about DGSE, I have a range of sources, as you've said, and those sources point to Paris, and they point towards DGSE.
[01:38:02.976 --> 01:38:03.417]  Now DGSE...
[01:38:05.038 --> 01:38:07.659]  Now, DGSE is the equivalent of an MI6.
[01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:08.620]  It's outward.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.681]  DGSU is internal.
[01:38:11.421 --> 01:38:17.004]  It's the DST, Direction de Surveillance de la Territoire, which is the internal agency.
[01:38:18.225 --> 01:38:20.066]  And the DST are internal.
[01:38:20.106 --> 01:38:21.466]  DGSE are external.
[01:38:22.327 --> 01:38:23.427]  Let's just put it this way, Alex.
[01:38:23.467 --> 01:38:26.289]  The operation has all the hallmarks of DGSE.
[01:38:26.949 --> 01:38:30.971]  And British intelligence, on my sources, are furious.
[01:38:31.111 --> 01:38:32.012]  They are not happy at all.
[01:38:32.072 --> 01:38:34.513]  Because David, after all, was a British intelligence asset.
[01:38:34.933 --> 01:38:49.647]  Well, by the way, my webmaster, Paul Watson, has talked to a major British news reporter who has talked directly to British intelligence, and they said months ago, I'm talking six months ago, the same thing that you just said here.
[01:38:50.442 --> 01:38:55.650]  Oh, that is interesting, because that would be almost certainly a different source to mine.
[01:38:55.671 --> 01:38:56.412]  It might be.
[01:38:56.432 --> 01:38:57.553]  We're talking to the same people.
[01:38:57.914 --> 01:38:59.917]  One of the problems in the intelligence world is loopback.
[01:39:00.819 --> 01:39:05.306]  Something you think is independent confirmation may turn out to be.
[01:39:05.486 --> 01:39:15.968]  I understand, but I mean clearly from the circumstantial, from the material evidence, you've got murder, you've got a cover-up, you've got a spin, you've got a motive, you've got him telling the U.S.
[01:39:16.028 --> 01:39:20.589]  doctor, his colleague, if I don't shut up, I'm going to be found dead in the woods, they're going to kill me.
[01:39:20.609 --> 01:39:22.629]  I mean, this is all public now.
[01:39:23.029 --> 01:39:25.910]  We have him saying, they're going to kill me and put me in the woods.
[01:39:26.630 --> 01:39:31.891]  You said that you've talked to intelligence people who said, yeah, they knew that Kelly was about to get it before he even died.
[01:39:31.911 --> 01:39:33.111]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:39:33.371 --> 01:39:50.717]  Yeah, the source that spoke to me on 19th July, after the assassination, because you see this source was a friend of David Kelly's, and so David was a friend of a friend, and this source obviously was not very happy, it didn't take him five minutes to work out that this was murder, not suicide.
[01:39:51.497 --> 01:39:54.498]  He then made inquiries, and he established from
[01:39:55.163 --> 01:39:59.187]  Other sources that the murder was known about in advance, i.e.
[01:39:59.247 --> 01:40:15.280]  the death of David Kelly was known about within a section of Whitehall prior to the 17th of July and he was very unhappy and that source came through to me and effectively I'm acting as an interface between the media and the intelligence community.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:20.625]  It is not possible for the intelligence community to do what I'm doing now and go on to a radio show
[01:40:22.805 --> 01:40:27.286]  Well, you have an impeccable record, and you've been involved in a lot of high-profile cases.
[01:40:27.346 --> 01:40:34.009]  You've testified before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for our Senate here, and you write for major intelligence journals.
[01:40:34.069 --> 01:40:42.812]  You've certainly impressed me, Mr. Shrimpton, because I study this stuff continually, and you're just massively knowledgeable, more knowledgeable in many areas than I am.
[01:40:43.373 --> 01:40:45.573]  I should correct.
[01:40:45.633 --> 01:40:48.094]  I didn't testify before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
[01:40:48.154 --> 01:40:49.635]  The briefing I gave was a closed
[01:40:50.339 --> 01:40:52.240]  Well I understand that's what I meant.
[01:41:04.492 --> 01:41:05.152]  Uh, very nice, ma'am.
[01:41:05.173 --> 01:41:08.675]  Well, just to be clear, sir, I know when you guys testify, it's always public.
[01:41:09.095 --> 01:41:12.597]  Here, most of what they do, obviously, you know is behind doors.
[01:41:12.617 --> 01:41:13.157]  That's what I mean.
[01:41:13.217 --> 01:41:19.001]  Yeah, this was a, with the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I was invited into their operation.
[01:41:19.021 --> 01:41:19.841]  They're very nice people.
[01:41:20.301 --> 01:41:29.547]  And this was a confidential briefing on a case in which I've been involved, which obviously I can't discuss on the air as a courtesy to the guys and girls I briefed in.
[01:41:29.587 --> 01:41:30.087]  Very nice people.
[01:41:30.667 --> 01:41:31.307]  Absolutely.
[01:41:31.387 --> 01:41:34.249]  Now, I was just going over some of your bio for folks.
[01:41:34.649 --> 01:41:57.738]  Now, as we sit here looking at this, for those who don't understand why an element inside England would want to use someone outside England who would then use another membrane between them and the hitmen, that's just standard operating procedure, but why would the French be happy to go along with getting rid of Kelly?
[01:41:58.593 --> 01:42:03.762]  Well, it would depend on the French assessment of whether or not the government would be at risk.
[01:42:03.822 --> 01:42:08.571]  The French would definitely want Tony Blair's government to remain in office.
[01:42:09.241 --> 01:42:14.022]  They would be very concerned, indeed, at any suggestion that might risk the government.
[01:42:14.062 --> 01:42:19.263]  There's a very strong geopolitical motive for the French retaining their ally.
[01:42:19.303 --> 01:42:23.024]  Don't forget that the Blair government is a close ally of President Chirac.
[01:42:23.044 --> 01:42:27.685]  There have been a series of private meetings between Prime Minister Blair and President Chirac since the assassination.
[01:42:27.705 --> 01:42:32.206]  And they're pushing the Euro, so they believe that if Blair's in danger, the Euro's in danger.
[01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:32.886]  Well, exactly.
[01:42:33.086 --> 01:42:37.587]  Tony Blair is the most high-profile politician in the UK, committed to destroying the national currency.
[01:42:38.327 --> 01:42:48.093]  And the French very much want Blair to remain in office for geopolitical reasons, and we've just had a very unusual summit between Blair, Chirac and the German Chancellor Schroeder.
[01:42:48.634 --> 01:42:49.714]  I have to be very cautious.
[01:42:49.834 --> 01:42:54.517]  I'm not naming Tony Blair as the person who generated the tasking for the assassination.
[01:42:54.557 --> 01:43:01.682]  Indeed, I am quite comfortable that it wasn't Tony Blair who put the tasking into Paris.
[01:43:02.722 --> 01:43:06.985]  Now, question marks, what did he know and when did he know it, that there I'm
[01:43:07.662 --> 01:43:09.362]  You know, I can't be so confident.
[01:43:09.603 --> 01:43:11.483]  Well, obviously Tony Blair's a puppet.
[01:43:11.603 --> 01:43:20.586]  I mean, he's not running the entire mechanism of the government, so... Well, he's a puppet Prime Minister anyway, so he's committed to the European Union.
[01:43:20.646 --> 01:43:27.388]  I mean, he takes his orders... Like anyone who says we should be in the European Union, you take your orders from Brussels, because that's what government from Brussels involves.
[01:43:27.928 --> 01:43:29.668]  Exactly, so... That's the constitutional position.
[01:43:30.388 --> 01:43:31.829]  You know, European Community Law is...
[01:43:32.869 --> 01:43:36.632]  Supreme, according to the European Union, and it takes precedence over British law.
[01:43:37.053 --> 01:43:41.216]  Yeah, your Magna Carta's gone if that sucker passes.
[01:43:42.016 --> 01:43:43.257]  They're tucked these days, Alex.
[01:43:44.018 --> 01:43:46.400]  But that's a broader issue.
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.941]  You're right, incidentally, on the false flagging.
[01:43:51.083 --> 01:44:00.170]  I'm often called upon, formally or informally, usually informally, to deconstruct assassinations, to look at a particular assassination and try and work out what's happened.
[01:44:00.966 --> 01:44:08.489]  Basically, in counterintelligence work, we would normally recognise eight methods of trying to disguise an assassination.
[01:44:08.509 --> 01:44:12.951]  The first method is you would try and blame it on your political opponents.
[01:44:12.991 --> 01:44:17.332]  That was done in Sweden recently with the assassination of Anna Lindh, the very nice Swedish Foreign Minister.
[01:44:17.772 --> 01:44:21.734]  An attempt was made to blame that on opponents of Sweden joining the Euro.
[01:44:22.803 --> 01:44:24.705]  You can blame it on a terrorist organisation.
[01:44:24.745 --> 01:44:28.669]  That was done particularly with the IRA in the attempted assassination of Margaret Thatcher.
[01:44:28.689 --> 01:44:34.975]  The assassination of the war hero Airey Neve, a Conservative MP, was blamed on the Irish National Liberation Army.
[01:44:35.355 --> 01:44:42.842]  The terrorist organisation might carry out the assassination, but in almost every case, the terrorist organisation is working for a government.
[01:44:43.963 --> 01:44:48.107]  A third method of disguising assassinations, Alex, in my experience, is to false flag them.
[01:44:48.786 --> 01:44:51.008]  Where it's blamed on another agency.
[01:44:51.028 --> 01:45:12.282]  Now there are elements of false flagging in the Kelly assassination, because had the team which carried out the assassination been discovered, clearly it could have been false flagged via Baghdad and, you know, we'd have had three Iraqis in Oxfordshire, assuming it was Iraqis for the sake of argument, and obviously blame would then go to Baghdad and Paris would be off the hook.
[01:45:12.302 --> 01:45:16.905]  The Iranians tried that quite successfully with the attempted assassination of the Pope.
[01:45:17.743 --> 01:45:18.383]  I don't know.
[01:45:33.689 --> 01:45:45.078]  We've had a lone gunman, a classic example of a lone gunman assassination theory in Europe, with the assassination of the Dutch politician Tim Fortune, which is blamed on a lone gunman.
[01:45:46.960 --> 01:46:02.032]  An explanation which doesn't carry much weight with me, since in the photographs of the assassin that I saw, there was what appeared to me to be a very thin wire leading up to an earpiece in his right ear, and normally, Alex, lone gunmen don't run around with radios and earpieces.
[01:46:02.785 --> 01:46:03.726]  Particularly high-tech ones.
[01:46:03.826 --> 01:46:06.549]  Well, it was the same thing with Yishak Rabin.
[01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:08.411]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:46:08.451 --> 01:46:17.279]  I mean, Netanyahu's giving speeches about, somebody ought to get rid of this guy, and then Rabin's security steps back and they blow him away.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:26.809]  Well, there are certainly respected commentators, General Thomas's, who would say that the Rabin assassination was definitely not down to a lone government.
[01:46:28.399 --> 01:46:29.860]  Then you've got illness.
[01:46:30.361 --> 01:46:31.382]  Now, this is fairly rare.
[01:46:31.402 --> 01:46:32.583]  It's difficult to fake an illness.
[01:46:33.063 --> 01:46:43.193]  It was done in the case of a British politician, Hugh Gaitskell, who was opposed to Britain joining the European Economic Community, and he came down with a tropical disease in Moscow in the middle of winter, generally speaking.
[01:46:43.213 --> 01:46:51.601]  It was spotted at the time as an assassination, but MI5, although they brought in Porton Down, where David Kelly worked, incidentally,
[01:46:52.425 --> 01:47:00.329]  Porton Down were brought in, but Porton Down couldn't work out how the disease which got Hugh Gaitskell, which is lupus disseminatus, a very nasty disease indeed.
[01:47:00.349 --> 01:47:02.470]  It attacked the organs very similar to Ebola.
[01:47:02.991 --> 01:47:04.892]  How this tropical disease had found its way to Moscow.
[01:47:04.932 --> 01:47:11.515]  They couldn't work out how, what the agent was for getting the lupus into Hugh Gaitskell.
[01:47:11.535 --> 01:47:15.797]  We now know it was probably aerosol, but at the time that technology wasn't known about in England.
[01:47:16.438 --> 01:47:20.800]  Then you've got accident, and there are a couple of interesting political assassinations in Zimbabwe of
[01:47:21.681 --> 01:47:26.005]  Road accidents, which I would put a question mark against.
[01:47:26.425 --> 01:47:29.088]  It's less common to try and stage accidents, but it's not unknown.
[01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:35.554]  A friend of mine was nearly taken out in Argentina a few years ago in what looked to me to be a slightly dubious accident.
[01:47:35.574 --> 01:47:36.615]  Well, what about Princess Diana?
[01:47:36.675 --> 01:47:41.679]  She says, Prince Charles is going to kill me in a staged automobile accident, and then she dies.
[01:47:41.859 --> 01:47:48.285]  Well, the Diana assassination is certainly probably the classic recent example of trying to make it look like an accident.
[01:47:48.325 --> 01:48:03.400]  Yeah, we've been having all these microbiologists in government weapons programs will be walking down the street at a university and a van jumps the rail, chases them, runs them over, then backs back over them, drives back over them, and the police just go, an accident, a hit and run.
[01:48:04.036 --> 01:48:12.262]  Well, if you want the truth about an assassination, the best people to talk to are the Israelis, because they had Danny Atom, a lovely guy, by the way, who was then head of Mossad in 1997.
[01:48:12.302 --> 01:48:13.903]  They're really nice people.
[01:48:14.564 --> 01:48:18.566]  Danny had teams, I think, on the entrance to the Alma Tunnel and on the exit as well.
[01:48:18.707 --> 01:48:20.008]  Interesting man, lovely chap.
[01:48:21.489 --> 01:48:22.169]  Tunnels where?
[01:48:22.669 --> 01:48:25.171]  This is the Alma Tunnel where Diana was taken.
[01:48:25.311 --> 01:48:26.852]  Oh, yes.
[01:48:27.733 --> 01:48:32.917]  The seventh method of disguising assassinations, in my experience, is to try and use a naturally occurring poison.
[01:48:33.757 --> 01:48:38.922]  A favourite of intelligence agencies is saxitoxin, which occurs in shellfish.
[01:48:39.042 --> 01:48:53.195]  So it's possible, providing you can get some shellfish into the stomach of the victim, a saxitoxin assassination, providing you successfully disguise the puncture wound, or you can find a method of getting the poison into the body.
[01:48:53.215 --> 01:48:56.318]  You know, you can get away with that if you're lucky.
[01:48:57.466 --> 01:49:03.890]  And then the final method is the one tried in the case of David Kelly, that you try and make the murder look like suicide, but it's very difficult.
[01:49:04.711 --> 01:49:11.515]  In this case, the attempt to slash the wrist was pointless, because he was already dead, and there's not enough blood.
[01:49:12.676 --> 01:49:17.099]  None of the witnesses, in my judgment, reports enough blood consistent with him bleeding out.
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:21.262]  And the medical experts that we've talked to, and I've, you know,
[01:49:21.994 --> 01:49:23.435]  I've been insisting on this.
[01:49:23.455 --> 01:49:28.640]  The medical experts generally reckon that you'll be looking for five pints, that's English pints, of blood.
[01:49:30.381 --> 01:49:41.351]  There's nothing I've seen that persuades me that more than a pint was lost and that's about consistent with what you'd expect from transecting one ulnar artery, completely transecting it.
[01:49:41.451 --> 01:49:48.017]  It then retracts clots and you get surprisingly little bleeding from cutting your ulnar artery.
[01:49:48.477 --> 01:49:52.139]  Well, sir, can we keep you a little bit in the next hour?
[01:49:52.179 --> 01:49:58.261]  Because I want to come back and go to Pat and Jim and Lenny and others that have been patiently holding.
[01:49:58.581 --> 01:49:59.442]  I'd be delighted to talk to you.
[01:49:59.462 --> 01:50:00.022]  I didn't realize.
[01:50:00.082 --> 01:50:00.482]  I'm sorry.
[01:50:00.502 --> 01:50:02.903]  I've been talking on and I've been keeping people on the phone.
[01:50:03.463 --> 01:50:04.684]  I apologize.
[01:50:04.724 --> 01:50:09.726]  This is important information because this shows the type of things that are going on in our world.
[01:50:10.126 --> 01:50:10.206]  Yeah.
[01:50:10.226 --> 01:50:18.349]  And how the media tries to spin this, but why do you think the media have been so willing to go along with the official government story that it's a suicide?
[01:50:18.909 --> 01:50:20.389]  Well, the political consequences.
[01:50:20.670 --> 01:50:24.171]  The mainstream media in the UK are largely committed to UK membership of the European Union.
[01:50:24.771 --> 01:50:33.634]  And my guess is that most of the newspapers in the UK would be worried about the political consequences of going public with any story suggesting David Kelly was assassinated.
[01:50:34.532 --> 01:50:35.873]  And then you've got technical competence.
[01:50:36.573 --> 01:50:46.880]  There aren't that many good investigative journalists in the UK, and it's not that difficult to get the mainstream media to buy an official version of events.
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:47.940]  Yeah, it's easy.
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:51.382]  Just, you know, the Fed says this, just write it and go drink a beer.
[01:50:51.502 --> 01:50:51.963]  We'll be back.
[01:50:54.048 --> 01:50:56.110]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[01:50:56.290 --> 01:50:57.932]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot!
[01:50:58.052 --> 01:51:06.039]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[01:51:06.299 --> 01:51:12.725]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.

[01:51:27.476 --> 01:51:30.178]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[01:51:30.418 --> 01:51:34.402]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking, or canoeing.

[01:53:18.643 --> 01:53:23.285]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:53:23.365 --> 01:53:29.626]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.

[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:03.121]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:07.223 --> 01:54:07.983]  Okay, folks.
[01:54:09.063 --> 01:54:10.364]  We're back live here.
[01:54:11.164 --> 01:54:12.505]  And we're about to go to your calls.
[01:54:12.525 --> 01:54:15.346]  Everybody's been holding patiently for our guest.
[01:54:15.386 --> 01:54:21.168]  Going back to our guest, Michael Shrempton, national security lawyer, barrister in England.
[01:54:21.668 --> 01:54:21.989]  Michael?
[01:54:22.729 --> 01:54:22.949]  Yeah?
[01:54:23.944 --> 01:54:40.515]  Continuing with what we were discussing, and just briefly recapping, you have a source who, in intelligence, talked to his other sources, and it was widely known in intelligence that there was an order to get rid of Kelly even before he died.
[01:54:41.895 --> 01:54:52.042]  My source learned after the assassination that others in Whitehall were aware of the assassination in advance.
[01:54:52.162 --> 01:54:52.322]  Yes.
[01:54:53.110 --> 01:55:10.377]  And that source had spoken to, obviously he was a friend of David Kelly's, knew him well, had worked with him, and clearly once his friend was found dead in a wood, made investigations, and when he made investigations, he discovered that this assassination was known about in advance.
[01:55:10.597 --> 01:55:22.482]  And he told, and this is in the Associated Press, BBC, you name it, he told an American doctor who was on the team with him in Iraq, he said, if I don't shut up about this, I'm going to end up dead in the woods.
[01:55:23.422 --> 01:55:37.337]  Yeah, there was also an interesting conversation with David Brucher, who was formerly British Ambassador in Prague in the Czech Republic, along similar lines, and David Brucher, I think, was a witness, in fact, to that inquiry.
[01:55:37.858 --> 01:55:41.942]  David Kelly worked... I should... I mean, I never had the privilege of meeting him.
[01:55:41.962 --> 01:55:43.564]  I'd love to have met him.
[01:55:43.804 --> 01:55:45.466]  My friend certainly worked with him and knew him.
[01:55:46.473 --> 01:55:58.462]  David worked very closely with the United States intelligence and worked very closely with Sergeant Mike Pedersen in particular, but I get the impression he was very highly thought of in the U.S.
[01:55:58.502 --> 01:55:59.743]  intelligence community as well.
[01:56:00.323 --> 01:56:10.791]  Was this done by the pro-EU crowd, the globalists I would call them, to put out a chilling effect into everybody in intelligence to keep your mouths shut?
[01:56:11.732 --> 01:56:13.173]  Broadly speaking, yes.
[01:56:16.265 --> 01:56:17.466]  Another question altogether.
[01:56:17.486 --> 01:56:25.872]  It's tolerably clear, one can't be certain, tolerably clear that he was taken out in order to prevent him talking.
[01:56:26.539 --> 01:56:37.748]  Now, what is unclear is whether he was taken out because there was concern he was about to acquire intelligence that might be highly damaging, or taken out because he had acquired it and was about to talk to the media.
[01:56:37.768 --> 01:56:41.871]  We know there was concern about the extent of his media contacts.
[01:56:41.891 --> 01:56:46.655]  He was also a microbiologist, and there's been a whole bunch of those dying around the world.
[01:56:46.695 --> 01:56:48.236]  Let's take a call.
[01:56:48.836 --> 01:56:49.677]  Patton, Indiana.
[01:56:49.717 --> 01:56:51.378]  Thanks for holding her on the air with our guests.
[01:56:51.398 --> 01:56:51.779]  Go ahead.
[01:56:52.159 --> 01:56:57.944]  Yes, well, this is a little off the subject, but it has to do with... Ma'am, you don't have your radio on, do you?
[01:57:00.646 --> 01:57:04.790]  Yeah, he... Or a speakerphone or something, because I'm not going to be able to talk to you if you don't turn it off.
[01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:05.730]  Okay, he did.
[01:57:05.751 --> 01:57:06.251]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:57:06.391 --> 01:57:10.815]  Okay, uh, it's on a couple subjects, uh, one an early call... I'm going to have to go ahead and put her on hold.
[01:57:11.055 --> 01:57:14.258]  I'm sorry, ma'am, but something's wrong with your phone, or you've got your radio on.
[01:57:15.879 --> 01:57:18.601]  Uh, let's try to bring her back up one more time, and I'm going to have to let her go.
[01:57:18.821 --> 01:57:19.442]  Uh, Pat, go ahead.
[01:57:19.462 --> 01:57:19.582]  Hello?
[01:57:19.622 --> 01:57:19.922]  Yeah?
[01:57:20.919 --> 01:57:22.480]  This is on a couple of subjects.
[01:57:22.841 --> 01:57:25.163]  I don't know what's wrong because we turned our radio off.
[01:57:25.183 --> 01:57:25.823]  Okay, it's alright.
[01:57:25.863 --> 01:57:26.244]  Go ahead.
[01:57:26.724 --> 01:57:29.627]  Okay, this is on a couple of subjects.
[01:57:29.827 --> 01:57:34.331]  One from Earlham College and one from a town hall meeting I had with Mike Pence.
[01:57:35.015 --> 01:57:35.496]  On Friday.
[01:57:35.516 --> 01:57:35.556]  No.
[01:57:52.794 --> 01:57:55.296]  Let's... I know there's a whole bunch of calls here for you.
[01:57:55.316 --> 01:57:57.938]  We'll try to sort them out and find out what's going on.
[01:57:58.558 --> 01:58:06.144]  As we talk to our guest, Michael Shrimpton, and national intelligence barrister in England.
[01:58:06.204 --> 01:58:09.746]  I bet you see all kinds of just amazing stuff in your job.
[01:58:10.427 --> 01:58:10.987]  I do, yes.
[01:58:12.508 --> 01:58:14.750]  Not all that I can talk about on the air.
[01:58:14.810 --> 01:58:16.011]  And I meet some very interesting people.
[01:58:16.351 --> 01:58:21.595]  And I had a very, very interesting visit to Israel in the middle of last year looking at the new security fence being built.
[01:58:22.245 --> 01:58:22.645]  All right.
[01:58:22.725 --> 01:58:26.668]  Well, I hear the music, so that means we've got to go ahead and break.
[01:58:27.269 --> 01:58:31.352]  And when we get back and start the third hour, we'll go straight to your calls, folks.
[01:58:31.372 --> 01:58:34.174]  You want to talk to our guest?
[01:58:34.995 --> 01:58:36.856]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:37.096 --> 01:58:38.558]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:38.618 --> 01:58:42.981]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:43.401 --> 01:58:51.988]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:58:52.208 --> 01:59:03.498]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:59:03.698 --> 01:59:06.360]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:10.804]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled.
[01:59:11.004 --> 01:59:13.145]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:59:13.306 --> 01:59:15.187]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:59:15.387 --> 01:59:21.411]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:59:21.651 --> 01:59:27.275]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:59:27.655 --> 01:59:31.577]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:32.297]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:59:32.317 --> 01:59:33.377]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:33.538 --> 01:59:33.818]  Big Brother.
[01:59:33.838 --> 01:59:34.938]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:34.998 --> 01:59:35.859]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:35.939 --> 01:59:36.339]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.929 --> 01:59:57.809]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.829 --> 02:00:02.110]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.671 --> 02:00:06.772]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:06.992 --> 02:00:09.332]  Alright, my friends.
[02:00:09.392 --> 02:00:10.953]  Now into the third hour.
[02:00:12.053 --> 02:00:20.535]  Talking to Michael Shrimpton, National Security Barrister in England with his intelligence sources concerning the murder of Dr. David Kelly.
[02:00:21.776 --> 02:00:25.957]  And British people are very
[02:00:27.020 --> 02:00:31.762]  Very suspicious, as are many other folks around the world.
[02:00:32.482 --> 02:00:34.083]  And more and more is coming out.
[02:00:34.663 --> 02:00:36.724]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim in Illinois.
[02:00:36.804 --> 02:00:37.804]  Jim, thanks for holding.
[02:00:37.844 --> 02:00:38.965]  You're on the air with our guest.
[02:00:38.985 --> 02:00:39.425]  Go ahead.
[02:00:40.485 --> 02:00:41.585]  I have two quick questions.
[02:00:42.426 --> 02:00:46.167]  Mrs. Shrimpton, what is David Kelly's wise thing about his murder?
[02:00:47.788 --> 02:00:49.128]  Janice Kelly... Hi, Jim.
[02:00:49.929 --> 02:00:52.450]  Janice Kelly accepts that it was suicide.
[02:00:52.510 --> 02:00:54.370]  At least that's her official position.
[02:00:55.891 --> 02:00:56.111]  Okay.
[02:00:56.958 --> 02:01:05.864]  My next question, why didn't the British or the American or the Israeli intelligence assassinate Saddam Hussein before the war?
[02:01:07.265 --> 02:01:12.289]  Well that's a big question, probably better directed to intelligence officials.
[02:01:12.909 --> 02:01:19.254]  Assassination is a very, I mean I'm opposed to assassinations in principle, one of the reasons why I'm outraged by David Kelly's assassination.
[02:01:20.565 --> 02:01:30.612]  Assassination is a double-edged sword, and I think had we gone in and taken out Saddam Hussein, that would have rebounded on both Britain and America very quickly.
[02:01:30.672 --> 02:01:34.855]  So I think the call not to assassinate him was probably well made.
[02:01:35.315 --> 02:01:40.599]  It's also more difficult to assassinate politicians like Saddam Hussein than first appears.
[02:01:40.619 --> 02:01:42.020]  You remember the CIA's
[02:01:43.943 --> 02:01:45.726]  ...to try and get rid of Fidel Castro.
[02:01:46.527 --> 02:01:52.218]  They had to go for several years and they didn't get anywhere close to assassinating him with exploding cigars and what have you.
[02:01:53.899 --> 02:01:56.340]  I would say the call not to take Saddam Hussein out was right.
[02:01:57.721 --> 02:02:04.186]  The danger with assassinating somebody like Saddam Hussein, you build up inside Iraq popular support for his regime.
[02:02:04.206 --> 02:02:14.012]  Yeah, you turn him into a martyr and also it'll cause a revolution even before you get there and then you won't control kind of the way the balls break.
[02:02:14.293 --> 02:02:14.913]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:14.953 --> 02:02:16.474]  That's a really good question.
[02:02:16.634 --> 02:02:17.415]  Anything else, Jim?
[02:02:17.435 --> 02:02:18.195]  No, thank you.
[02:02:18.776 --> 02:02:19.416]  Great to talk to you, Jim.
[02:02:19.636 --> 02:02:20.497]  I've got a question.
[02:02:20.597 --> 02:02:21.337]  Where is this going?
[02:02:23.139 --> 02:02:24.981]  I've got a question for you, Michael.
[02:02:25.181 --> 02:02:26.222]  Where is all this going?
[02:02:26.262 --> 02:02:34.270]  As more and more doctors and people come forward, and as you come forward and say it's clear that he was murdered, I mean, where does all this go for Tony Blair?
[02:02:35.531 --> 02:02:39.495]  Well, there are indications that he may be preparing to resign.
[02:02:40.015 --> 02:02:44.940]  He's denied officially over the weekend that he's planning to resign, which is an indication that he is.
[02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.842]  Never believe anything until it's officially denied.
[02:02:48.810 --> 02:02:50.711]  A number of key advisors have bailed out.
[02:02:51.172 --> 02:02:58.697]  Alastair Campbell, another key advisor, Philip Gould, has just been offered a peerage, which is a form of retirement we have in England that you don't have in the United States.
[02:02:58.717 --> 02:03:00.158]  Michael Meacher months ago.
[02:03:00.698 --> 02:03:01.539]  Michael Meacher, yes.
[02:03:02.319 --> 02:03:03.380]  There are now calls.
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:04.641]  Michael Meacher's just issued a call.
[02:03:04.701 --> 02:03:06.902]  He's a former government minister.
[02:03:07.803 --> 02:03:11.766]  Michael has issued a call over the last weekend, calling on him to go.
[02:03:11.786 --> 02:03:16.589]  There are indications that he is on his way out, but it's up to him.
[02:03:17.817 --> 02:03:18.698]  Or after his party.
[02:03:18.919 --> 02:03:20.221]  Well that would certainly be good.
[02:03:20.261 --> 02:03:22.465]  I mean, have you ever had a Prime Minister this bad?
[02:03:24.085 --> 02:03:26.107]  Well, that's a political question.
[02:03:26.887 --> 02:03:29.369]  The answer is probably, but I can't remember when.
[02:03:30.010 --> 02:03:37.256]  It's a close toss-up between Tony Blair, John Major and Lord North, who lost the American colonies.
[02:03:37.296 --> 02:03:41.759]  But from your point of view, Lord North is probably quite good to have in Downing Street.
[02:03:42.780 --> 02:03:43.541]  That's funny.
[02:03:44.221 --> 02:03:49.886]  Neville Chamberlain, I think that without being disrespectful to my Prime Minister on the air,
[02:03:50.487 --> 02:03:54.751]  I think it's a close call between Tony Blair and Neville Chamberlain.
[02:03:55.872 --> 02:04:12.086]  You could have ten different politicians and economists and military strategists sit around a table and come up with ten different answers as to whether Neville Chamberlain surrendered more of Europe than Tony Blair, and whether Tony Blair surrendered more to France and Germany than Neville Chamberlain did.
[02:04:12.607 --> 02:04:13.287]  It's a close-run thing.
[02:04:13.627 --> 02:04:16.270]  Well, I think it's clearly Tony Blair if he gets what he wants.
[02:04:17.432 --> 02:04:25.256]  Yeah, I have to say, having met Tony Blair, he's quite a pleasant, personable individual.
[02:04:25.276 --> 02:04:27.276]  He's not a monster when you meet him.
[02:04:27.597 --> 02:04:29.838]  Well, they said that about Adolf Hitler, too.
[02:04:30.518 --> 02:04:31.518]  You know, we've got to break.
[02:04:31.759 --> 02:04:34.660]  We'll come right back and we'll go to Lenny Bloom.
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:44.367]  Who's been on this story and we'll also talk to David in Texas and a few other callers for our guests and we'll get to Bob and Ron and others and a bunch of other key news items.
[02:04:44.407 --> 02:04:44.868]  Stay with us!
[02:04:45.288 --> 02:04:46.909]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[02:05:49.624 --> 02:05:53.993]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:56.664 --> 02:05:58.606]  This disaster is a new world order.
[02:05:58.686 --> 02:06:01.528]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:06:01.748 --> 02:06:05.971]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:06:06.032 --> 02:06:12.957]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[02:09:12.321 --> 02:09:17.644]  If you agree with the passion, disagree with it, thought it was a powerful film, I certainly did, I certainly cried.
[02:09:18.184 --> 02:09:19.524]  You don't have a heart if you don't.
[02:09:20.225 --> 02:09:22.906]  A total free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:09:23.486 --> 02:09:27.247]  It is Thursday, we're live.

[02:09:33.750 --> 02:09:34.450]  Go ahead Ethan.
[02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:35.130]  Hello Alex.
[02:09:36.704 --> 02:09:38.646]  Um, I want to say I'm not a Christian.
[02:09:38.686 --> 02:09:49.318]  I don't consider myself a Christian, but I do think that, uh, because I don't think he is God, but I definitely think he's a revolutionary, wonderful spiritual leader, and I think The Passion was a great movie, and everyone should see it.
[02:09:49.478 --> 02:09:50.539]  So you did go see it?
[02:09:50.820 --> 02:09:54.744]  Yeah, and I think it totally displays how you will government persecutes the innocent.
[02:09:55.253 --> 02:10:02.259]  Well, I wouldn't adhere to any organized religion because I think that it had always been a tool of the elite to control and partition civilizations.
[02:10:02.379 --> 02:10:12.567]  Yeah, but that's what Christ was saying, is He was saying this organized thing has turned into a fraud, and He was telling the truth, and I believe He was God.
[02:10:12.767 --> 02:10:19.612]  But I totally believe that these puppet masters pulling the strings behind the scenes are involved in satanic ritual abuse of children.
[02:10:19.892 --> 02:10:20.853]  Well, we know they are.
[02:10:20.873 --> 02:10:21.774]  They've been caught doing it.
[02:10:22.154 --> 02:10:23.255]  Well, that's my point.
[02:10:23.335 --> 02:10:27.038]  Why does the elite believe in Satan secretly if there really isn't a God?
[02:10:27.318 --> 02:10:27.619]  Yeah.
[02:10:28.940 --> 02:10:37.507]  Well, they're just obsessed with this... You know, anyone, like you said... So you think it's a manifestation of their psychology that they worship the horned God?
[02:10:37.527 --> 02:10:40.630]  No, I believe there's definitely something evil that they worship.
[02:10:41.891 --> 02:10:43.412]  I just... I believe in God.
[02:10:44.213 --> 02:10:48.376]  I'm just more of a... Not just... I believe in God.
[02:10:48.857 --> 02:10:49.237]  One God.
[02:10:49.781 --> 02:10:52.523]  I just don't really follow any religion in particular.
[02:10:53.404 --> 02:11:05.134]  But I think that they abuse separation of church and state in the name of the phony liberals because they want to use that to crack down on freedom of speech.
[02:11:05.354 --> 02:11:08.777]  And then the phony conservatives say Christianity is worshiping government.
[02:11:08.797 --> 02:11:09.417]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:09.577 --> 02:11:09.758]  Yep.
[02:11:10.418 --> 02:11:11.199]  Look, I'll say this.
[02:11:12.965 --> 02:11:20.731]  A liberal conservative of all these terms, when you get down to it, the Republicans and the Democrats have different rhetoric, but their actions are identical.
[02:11:23.313 --> 02:11:28.116]  And, I mean, that's really, at the end of the day, what it comes down to.
[02:11:30.217 --> 02:11:32.679]  And the elites do believe in the occult.
[02:11:33.700 --> 02:11:36.262]  And they do hate real Christianity.
[02:11:36.922 --> 02:11:37.923]  They can't stand it.
[02:11:39.387 --> 02:11:42.389]  Now, establishment Christianity is something completely different.
[02:11:42.469 --> 02:11:48.575]  It's, you know, the Patriot Act is good, that's what Jay Sekulow says, you know, go along with it.
[02:11:48.595 --> 02:11:59.024]  And, you know, some people, some of the Mormons aren't going, they're saying it's too violent, it's R-rated, and that's missing the forest for the trees, or the trees for the forest.
[02:12:01.198 --> 02:12:05.020]  Some Protestants, and I'm a Protestant, say, well, it's got some Catholic overtones.
[02:12:05.560 --> 02:12:08.461]  My point is, it's better than what Hollywood's been putting out.
[02:12:08.801 --> 02:12:09.681]  It's uplifting.
[02:12:10.422 --> 02:12:12.442]  It's very biblical.
[02:12:12.542 --> 02:12:14.423]  I'd say 98% accurate.
[02:12:14.463 --> 02:12:25.167]  I mean, there wasn't really a crow there pulling an eyeball out of one of the murderers' socket or whatever, and then the thief goes to heaven.
[02:12:26.062 --> 02:12:27.262]  Or was it vice versa?
[02:12:28.163 --> 02:12:36.244]  I mean, there's some stuff in there, but the devil in the four Gospels isn't there dancing around while Christ is dying.
[02:12:37.225 --> 02:12:42.746]  But he certainly was there when Christ goes to confront him in hell and take the keys to hell and death.
[02:12:43.186 --> 02:12:49.028]  And we know the devil was there throughout Christ's ministry trying to stop him.
[02:12:52.173 --> 02:12:52.773]  Great film!
[02:12:52.833 --> 02:12:53.834]  Great film's all I can say.
[02:12:54.154 --> 02:12:55.235]  Uh, who's up next?
[02:12:55.495 --> 02:12:56.436]  Who should I go to next?
[02:12:57.477 --> 02:12:58.577]  Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[02:12:58.617 --> 02:12:59.178]  Go ahead, Emmett.
[02:12:59.978 --> 02:13:00.799]  Yes, Alex.
[02:13:01.739 --> 02:13:16.509]  I hate to go against the grain on this, but years ago when I was a boy, we had a pastor, Mal Kerr, and he used to say, if your father was killed by a speeding locomotive, would you walk around with a little locomotive on a chain around your neck?
[02:13:18.068 --> 02:13:20.355]  Same thing with, uh, Christ.
[02:13:20.616 --> 02:13:23.244]  I don't walk around with a chain with a cross on.
[02:13:24.013 --> 02:13:26.914]  I don't want to go see a movie where he's murdered, either.
[02:13:26.934 --> 02:13:28.014]  Well, let me just stop you.
[02:13:28.474 --> 02:13:31.075]  That's where... That's the sacrifice.
[02:13:31.095 --> 02:13:32.615]  That's the loving thing he did.
[02:13:32.655 --> 02:13:33.715]  It's a beautiful thing.
[02:13:34.235 --> 02:13:35.456]  It was God's decision.
[02:13:35.916 --> 02:13:45.458]  And so I don't see how you can say that laying your life down for those that you love, but also those that hate you, is not a wonderful gift.
[02:13:46.398 --> 02:13:48.258]  And, you know, for the remission of sins.
[02:13:48.298 --> 02:13:50.299]  And so I really... You know, I've heard this line
[02:13:51.582 --> 02:13:54.505]  It is, but I wouldn't want to make a profit off of it.
[02:13:54.945 --> 02:14:04.893]  Well, you know, there's a famous comedian, Bill Hicks, who I agree with some of what he had to say and disagree with a lot of what he had to say, but he said, yeah, you know, do you think when Jesus comes back, he wants to see a cross?
[02:14:05.934 --> 02:14:07.115]  And yes, I think he does.
[02:14:07.155 --> 02:14:09.938]  He wants us to remember what he did for us.
[02:14:09.958 --> 02:14:18.845]  Let me tell you, if the feds grab me and blow my head off or beat me to death when I'm fighting tyranny, I hope people will remember me for the sacrifice I made.
[02:14:20.106 --> 02:14:26.071]  And if the globalists do something to you because you're fighting tyranny, I'm going to try to remember you, and I hope folks will.
[02:14:26.432 --> 02:14:27.513]  It's like the Alamo.
[02:14:27.613 --> 02:14:28.714]  Remember the Alamo.
[02:14:28.734 --> 02:14:34.799]  They didn't say, forget the Alamo, those 186 people that died valiantly for Texas independence.
[02:14:36.821 --> 02:14:37.522]  That's true.
[02:14:38.102 --> 02:14:39.784]  Yes, Emmett, come on.
[02:14:40.224 --> 02:14:40.624]  Oh, well.
[02:14:42.762 --> 02:14:45.403]  Everyone has to make up their own decision on this.
[02:14:45.623 --> 02:14:48.403]  Well, look, I don't wear a cross, but it's just because I don't wear jewelry.
[02:14:48.443 --> 02:14:54.685]  Well, I'm married now, I wear a wedding ring, and half the time I don't, because I can't stand jewelry, but... Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:14:54.745 --> 02:14:55.405]  Good to hear from you.
[02:14:55.425 --> 02:14:57.005]  I really appreciate it, Emmett.
[02:14:57.305 --> 02:15:07.427]  Out of this, though, I mean, it shouldn't get into cross-worship, or, you know, worship of the saints, or, you know, you put that above Christ.
[02:15:07.987 --> 02:15:10.168]  Let's talk to Carl in New York.
[02:15:10.228 --> 02:15:11.108]  Carl, go ahead.
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:12.620]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:15:12.780 --> 02:15:13.081]  Good!
[02:15:14.141 --> 02:15:15.062]  What was it, last month?
[02:15:15.542 --> 02:15:21.805]  Both George Bush, Tony Blair, and the Pope were saying that we all worship the same God.
[02:15:22.486 --> 02:15:23.506]  Which we certainly don't.
[02:15:23.986 --> 02:15:25.427]  I wonder what God they're worshiping.
[02:15:26.348 --> 02:15:30.470]  I'm in the middle of a book written by Gail Ripplinger, who was a guest on the show.
[02:15:30.570 --> 02:15:33.712]  I think you said that Tex Morris married you and your wife?
[02:15:34.312 --> 02:15:34.552]  Yes.
[02:15:35.232 --> 02:15:38.034]  Yes, and Gail Ripplinger was his guest one day.
[02:15:38.644 --> 02:15:39.404]  And she wrote a book.
[02:15:39.484 --> 02:15:40.385]  I forget what it's called.
[02:15:40.425 --> 02:15:46.247]  There's one on the King James Bible and another one on the new versions of the Bible.
[02:15:46.307 --> 02:15:51.589]  But I'm just curious why on another talk show why it comes into discussion of who married me.
[02:15:51.729 --> 02:15:54.150]  I don't under... Oh, you mentioned that yourself.
[02:15:54.590 --> 02:15:55.951]  Oh, okay.
[02:15:56.011 --> 02:15:58.171]  I was confused why you're... Yeah, I've talked about it.
[02:15:58.211 --> 02:16:02.133]  I just didn't... That's why I like Tex Marr.
[02:16:02.173 --> 02:16:03.954]  He's a good character.
[02:16:04.794 --> 02:16:07.255]  But this Gail Ripplinger was talking about
[02:16:08.232 --> 02:16:11.615]  Um, how Satan has gotten into the new versions of the Bible.
[02:16:12.075 --> 02:16:14.277]  And she points out example after example in this book.
[02:16:14.297 --> 02:16:17.199]  Yeah, these new translations are really bad.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:18.500]  They are.
[02:16:18.660 --> 02:16:22.844]  And you had a guy on the first hour talking about the Gideon's Bible.
[02:16:24.125 --> 02:16:25.626]  The Gideon's Bible is a new version.
[02:16:26.026 --> 02:16:28.028]  And it's in all hotels and everything.
[02:16:28.510 --> 02:16:30.091]  It's misinforming people.
[02:16:30.311 --> 02:16:35.992]  It's changing... This is why, though, I don't have a religious talk show, because everybody fights with everybody.
[02:16:36.052 --> 02:16:39.734]  Everybody's got the right sect and doing the right, you know, has the answer.
[02:16:40.154 --> 02:16:49.056]  I just fight evil and do unto others as I have them do unto me, and I fight against the New World Order, because I know that's what God wants me to do.
[02:16:49.256 --> 02:16:49.837]  I am driven.
[02:16:50.097 --> 02:16:50.677]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:50.697 --> 02:16:51.637]  Good to hear from you, Carl.
[02:16:52.397 --> 02:16:52.758]  Ruth!
[02:16:52.958 --> 02:16:54.078]  Ruth, where are you calling us from?
[02:16:54.890 --> 02:16:55.330]  Uh, yes.
[02:16:55.530 --> 02:16:57.411]  I was wondering about this movie, The Passion.
[02:16:57.451 --> 02:16:58.591]  Yeah, where are you calling us from?
[02:16:58.611 --> 02:16:59.731]  Uh, Missouri.
[02:17:00.092 --> 02:17:00.712]  Good to talk to you.
[02:17:00.752 --> 02:17:01.092]  Go ahead.
[02:17:01.132 --> 02:17:01.912]  Good to talk to you.
[02:17:02.112 --> 02:17:05.633]  Um, I was wondering though, uh, did it show that he resurrected from the dead?
[02:17:05.853 --> 02:17:06.474]  Uh, yes it did.
[02:17:06.494 --> 02:17:07.194]  It did?
[02:17:07.214 --> 02:17:08.374]  Uh, yes it did.
[02:17:08.394 --> 02:17:14.316]  Okay, because, uh, I had heard differently, but... Okay, well I guess I'm lying to you then.
[02:17:14.576 --> 02:17:16.857]  Okay, but I kind of agree with the previous caller.
[02:17:16.877 --> 02:17:19.237]  I don't trust anything that Hollywood puts out.
[02:17:20.758 --> 02:17:24.139]  Well, Hollywood didn't put this out, and Hollywood attacked them.
[02:17:25.413 --> 02:17:30.895]  I understand, but I think there's a smoke screen.
[02:17:30.975 --> 02:17:38.938]  I don't want to get into my personal life, but I know the Gibsons, and they're good people.
[02:17:40.659 --> 02:17:45.801]  Man, I tell you, we are really in trouble if we can't even see something that's good when it's right in front of us.
[02:17:46.281 --> 02:17:53.204]  Well, I have a problem, though, when all the mainline churches, and it just seems like everybody's just jumping on board all of a sudden.
[02:17:54.371 --> 02:17:58.395]  Well, I mean, look, look, look, they're definitely trying to co-opt it for their own reasons.
[02:17:58.415 --> 02:18:01.938]  I mean, you know, look, it's like Bush with this Defense of Marriage Act.
[02:18:02.399 --> 02:18:06.022]  He's not doing that because he really is a Christian or cares about marriage.
[02:18:06.222 --> 02:18:09.325]  He's doing it because the will of the people demand it.
[02:18:09.565 --> 02:18:12.047]  Now, am I saying that this constitutional amendment's good?
[02:18:12.428 --> 02:18:18.233]  No, because it'll start a con-con, a constitutional convention, where they can rewrite the whole thing.
[02:18:18.593 --> 02:18:25.300]  But, Bush is having to respond on the surface like he is good, because we really have the power.
[02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:29.223]  We have to stop having this attitude of, we're defeated, we don't have power.
[02:18:29.483 --> 02:18:34.208]  We have the spending power, we have the boycott power, we have the decision-making power,
[02:18:34.528 --> 02:18:48.882]  To steer this economy and this society, the problem is we've cowered too long in the shadows and let the tiny, globalist elite run things, and it's time we stop doing that, and it's time we create our own media and our own infrastructure.
[02:18:49.102 --> 02:18:52.125]  Look at the fruits of Mel Gibson.
[02:18:52.785 --> 02:18:53.526]  Braveheart.
[02:18:53.866 --> 02:18:54.687]  The patriot.
[02:18:55.308 --> 02:18:55.908]  The passion.
[02:18:56.969 --> 02:19:02.753]  And now he says, earlier when I did these violent movies, I was wrong, I was a sinner, I still am a sinner.
[02:19:03.093 --> 02:19:04.794]  I'm going to do uplifting things now.
[02:19:05.214 --> 02:19:06.555]  And that's what he's trying to do.
[02:19:06.835 --> 02:19:12.158]  And if you can't see that it's good, then you better check yourself.
[02:19:12.619 --> 02:19:17.401]  Well, not everything in Braveheart was completely good.
[02:19:17.482 --> 02:19:19.123]  None of us are without sin.
[02:19:19.343 --> 02:19:21.644]  There's a lot of stuff I do that's wrong.
[02:19:21.684 --> 02:19:22.284]  Thanks for the call.
[02:19:22.324 --> 02:19:23.405]  Listen, I'll tell you what.
[02:19:25.783 --> 02:19:28.945]  Mel Gibson and The Passion are a lot better than the New World Order.
[02:19:31.127 --> 02:19:33.168]  It's a lot better than the stuff coming out of Hollywood.
[02:19:33.889 --> 02:19:37.572]  And I think deep down a lot of people are jealous over Mel Gibson's money and fame.
[02:19:38.392 --> 02:19:39.753]  I think there's some envy going on.
[02:19:40.033 --> 02:19:44.196]  And, uh, it's... Boy, I tell ya, I can tell it's good.
[02:19:46.038 --> 02:19:49.120]  Hi, this is Jack Browner with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[02:19:49.620 --> 02:19:51.642]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.

[02:20:18.812 --> 02:20:22.215]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[02:20:22.665 --> 02:20:24.947]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[02:20:25.307 --> 02:20:26.127]  Do it now.
[02:20:26.388 --> 02:20:28.589]  That's $10 collector gold coins.
[02:20:28.609 --> 02:20:30.831]  $10 and $20 collector gold coins.
[02:20:30.971 --> 02:20:34.533]  At the nearest amount in my 24 years in this business.

[02:21:52.365 --> 02:22:03.273]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:22:03.553 --> 02:22:05.354]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:22:05.614 --> 02:22:08.936]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:22:09.276 --> 02:22:19.721]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:22:20.021 --> 02:22:20.522]  That's right!
[02:22:20.702 --> 02:22:27.828]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:22:28.108 --> 02:22:32.232]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:22:46.337 --> 02:22:46.677]  I think so.

[02:23:46.428 --> 02:23:51.550]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:52.250 --> 02:23:54.631]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:54.651 --> 02:23:54.791]  Stop!
[02:23:57.683 --> 02:24:02.065]  Coming up, I'm going to get into some of the issues with the economy, durable goods, orders.
[02:24:03.066 --> 02:24:05.087]  Log, a surprise drop in January.
[02:24:05.307 --> 02:24:06.367]  Oh, very surprising.
[02:24:06.988 --> 02:24:12.010]  Greenspan urges slashing Social Security and a lot more.
[02:24:12.190 --> 02:24:13.931]  So we'll get into some of that, too.
[02:24:14.911 --> 02:24:16.752]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:24:16.812 --> 02:24:18.433]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 800-259-9231.
[02:24:18.453 --> 02:24:19.394]  John in Arizona, go ahead.
[02:24:19.414 --> 02:24:20.054]  Hi, Alex.
[02:24:20.114 --> 02:24:20.974]  How you doing?
[02:24:27.307 --> 02:24:28.928]  This is in reference to your last call.
[02:24:28.948 --> 02:24:30.208]  I just wanted to make a quick point.
[02:24:30.549 --> 02:24:32.829]  The Gibson family, they're a really good family.
[02:24:32.869 --> 02:24:40.572]  In fact, I'm going to the Health and Freedom Rally, which is out in Irvine, California, and Hutton Gibson is going to be one of the banquet speakers there.
[02:24:41.533 --> 02:24:43.414]  Are you familiar with that rally at all, Alex?
[02:24:43.534 --> 02:24:43.834]  Uh-huh.
[02:24:43.894 --> 02:24:44.494]  Yeah, I sure am.
[02:24:44.714 --> 02:24:44.954]  Are you?
[02:24:45.514 --> 02:24:52.677]  I had a question for you in reference to this movie here that he put out.
[02:24:53.017 --> 02:24:54.098]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:24:55.689 --> 02:25:16.259]  One of the questions that I have is, okay, fighting this tyranny in the United States and throughout the world with the New World Order, I'm a Christian and I have a hard time understanding where the 13 families fit in, and in the Bible, in the book of Revelations, it says there's going to be the Antichrist.
[02:25:17.079 --> 02:25:18.680]  I don't quite understand it.
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:21.061]  Could you explain it a little bit?
[02:25:21.581 --> 02:25:25.283]  Sure, I'm going to let you go and try to answer the question as quickly as possible.
[02:25:27.603 --> 02:25:30.105]  Duties mine, consequences are God's.
[02:25:30.826 --> 02:25:31.206]  Okay?
[02:25:31.927 --> 02:25:32.567]  End of story.
[02:25:34.249 --> 02:25:43.096]  The infrastructure of the New World Order, I don't make the world fit into a template that preachers have taken and then interpreted the way they want to.
[02:25:43.897 --> 02:25:44.497]  You understand?
[02:25:44.517 --> 02:25:53.825]  I look at the world with the facts and the documents and the structure of the New World Order, and I report the structure of that New World Order.
[02:25:55.004 --> 02:26:00.548]  And so the churches say you're not going to have this because the Bible doesn't say it.
[02:26:00.568 --> 02:26:01.949]  Well, that's actually a fraud too.
[02:26:02.650 --> 02:26:08.654]  You've got these kings of the earth and they traffic in men's souls and all these evil kings.
[02:26:09.054 --> 02:26:12.437]  That's just how the world is set up and how it operates.
[02:26:13.081 --> 02:26:21.585]  And so people try to cram it into some interpretation of Revelations or they try to bring Nostradamus and his garbage quatrains into it.
[02:26:22.225 --> 02:26:22.905]  I don't do that.
[02:26:23.085 --> 02:26:23.745]  I'm a Christian.
[02:26:24.026 --> 02:26:25.226]  I believe in Jesus Christ.
[02:26:25.706 --> 02:26:32.029]  But I am a news program and I look at the world and study the world according to that lens.
[02:26:35.259 --> 02:26:43.567]  It's very frustrating, you know, every Christian sect has their own view of the world order and how the world runs and who's behind it.
[02:26:43.988 --> 02:26:45.850]  Well, I mean, I just go off the facts.
[02:26:46.530 --> 02:26:48.092]  And, oh, it's strange.
[02:26:48.112 --> 02:26:53.818]  When I don't listen to a preacher and I actually read the Bible, it says exactly what I see in the real world.
[02:26:54.098 --> 02:26:57.201]  If I go listen to some preacher, most of the time it's completely different.
[02:26:58.081 --> 02:26:58.542]  Okay.
[02:26:59.522 --> 02:27:04.507]  But, you know, the Founding Fathers didn't go, oh, King George is the Antichrist.
[02:27:04.747 --> 02:27:06.068]  We can't fight against him.
[02:27:06.088 --> 02:27:10.212]  You know, how can King George be bad?
[02:27:10.372 --> 02:27:11.934]  Only the Antichrist can be bad.
[02:27:12.694 --> 02:27:14.216]  There's an Antichrist spirit.
[02:27:14.236 --> 02:27:15.517]  There's a spirit of wickedness.
[02:27:15.537 --> 02:27:16.418]  There's evil people.
[02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:20.574]  And, uh, there's organized crime syndicates.
[02:27:20.914 --> 02:27:22.415]  And that's what the New World Order is.
[02:27:22.495 --> 02:27:28.081]  It's a big, global, organized crime syndicate, hereditary crime syndicate.
[02:27:29.282 --> 02:27:39.453]  And then the religion comes into it, because they're part of a hereditary death cult called the Skull and Bones, and that's just one node of a larger, worldwide cult.
[02:27:39.932 --> 02:27:48.100]  According to Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor, who talked about how he's a member of it, in his own political retrospective of Men and Power, his own autobiography.
[02:27:49.701 --> 02:28:04.135]  So, you know, the Bible tells me that evil devil worshippers in high places are under the control of demons and Satan and run things, and then, lo and behold, I study world leaders and they're all Satanists who are under the control of demons they believe.
[02:28:04.781 --> 02:28:15.005]  So even if you're an atheist, okay, our world leaders are complete lunatics who believe in the devil, so it might as well be real, because that's the manifestation of what they're creating.
[02:28:15.985 --> 02:28:22.848]  And that sounds completely crazy, what I just said, but it's historical, documented, mainstream, fact, hidden in plain view.
[02:28:24.589 --> 02:28:30.551]  So, we could be having world government come down on us right now, and they're going to kill all the Christians.
[02:28:31.829 --> 02:28:33.210]  Well, I'm still going to warn people.
[02:28:33.250 --> 02:28:34.350]  I'm still going to fight evil.
[02:28:34.570 --> 02:28:35.730]  I'm still going to stand up.
[02:28:36.251 --> 02:28:43.673]  You know, yesterday I read the BBC about how they kidnap kids in Eastern Europe and cut their organs out and kill them and sell the organs.
[02:28:44.593 --> 02:28:47.054]  I mean, I'm going to fight that even if they come kill me.
[02:28:47.074 --> 02:28:49.275]  I mean, you ask why?
[02:28:49.315 --> 02:28:52.936]  Because I'm just a normal human being with God's basic programming.
[02:28:52.976 --> 02:28:57.418]  So these so-called Christians, I hear them, they go, Praise God, it's almost all over.
[02:28:57.438 --> 02:28:58.938]  They're coming out with the microchips.
[02:28:59.158 --> 02:29:00.739]  We'll be raptured any minute.
[02:29:01.368 --> 02:29:05.610]  And then Pat Robertson goes, actually, the microchip isn't bad, it's not the mark.
[02:29:06.370 --> 02:29:07.411]  Go ahead and take it.
[02:29:07.951 --> 02:29:09.932]  Forced abortion's okay in China.
[02:29:10.272 --> 02:29:12.253]  And they go, okay, the chip is Christian.
[02:29:12.773 --> 02:29:14.634]  Okay, forced abortion is good.
[02:29:14.654 --> 02:29:16.615]  Hmm, we're beginning to understand.
[02:29:16.635 --> 02:29:18.815]  Oh, Jesus actually came back!
[02:29:19.096 --> 02:29:20.636]  He's our world leader now!
[02:29:20.876 --> 02:29:22.097]  He's bringing us peace!
[02:29:23.778 --> 02:29:24.818]  That's what's gonna happen!
[02:29:25.458 --> 02:29:26.059]  Ha ha ha!
[02:29:26.359 --> 02:29:29.160]  And these people, these people don't understand that yet!
[02:29:30.425 --> 02:29:31.586]  That's what I see happening.
[02:29:31.606 --> 02:29:32.627]  You wouldn't really want to know.
[02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:36.771]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.251 --> 02:29:38.853]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.773 --> 02:29:42.456]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.218 --> 02:29:49.882]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:29:50.282 --> 02:29:55.707]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:29:56.188 --> 02:29:57.269]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:29:57.289 --> 02:30:01.333]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:30:01.977 --> 02:30:15.280]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:30:15.800 --> 02:30:21.102]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:30:21.402 --> 02:30:27.223]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:30:35.172 --> 02:30:37.313]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:30:37.333 --> 02:30:37.393]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:30:45.538 --> 02:30:50.200]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the first-ever half-price package sale at the Ark Institute.

[02:31:38.406 --> 02:31:38.466]  P.O.
[02:31:38.566 --> 02:31:39.207]  Box 1227 Jacksonville, Oregon 97530.
[02:31:45.507 --> 02:31:47.869]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:31:48.109 --> 02:31:51.952]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:31:52.272 --> 02:31:53.093]  Read the labels.
[02:31:53.533 --> 02:31:57.676]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:31:57.876 --> 02:32:02.059]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:32:02.419 --> 02:32:07.303]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:32:07.683 --> 02:32:11.265]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:32:11.465 --> 02:32:16.788]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[02:32:52.072 --> 02:33:02.436]  Okay, my friends, we'll get to Ruth and Gary and Don and Dan and Howard taking a lot of calls on the show today.
[02:33:02.456 --> 02:33:05.597]  Probably took 20 calls in the first hour alone.
[02:33:05.617 --> 02:33:09.198]  Then we had that interview with that guest from Monday people wanted to hear again.
[02:33:09.238 --> 02:33:12.840]  So I got a few news stories, five or six, I want to get to as well.
[02:33:14.052 --> 02:33:21.518]  Before we do that, I want to remind the listeners that I've made 10 documentary films, written a book, and published a book.
[02:33:22.859 --> 02:33:23.740]  And they're all excellent.
[02:33:23.760 --> 02:33:25.121]  They all expose this system.
[02:33:25.461 --> 02:33:30.185]  And people ask, well, how do you have 13 Illuminati families and then have an Antichrist?
[02:33:31.166 --> 02:33:34.288]  Well, I mean, they're the dark workers of the New World Order.
[02:33:34.328 --> 02:33:35.669]  And believe me, I've looked at these families.
[02:33:35.689 --> 02:33:36.850]  They all are into the occult.
[02:33:37.091 --> 02:33:37.591]  It's public.
[02:33:38.773 --> 02:33:42.116]  And they're the stewards of this system, bringing it in.
[02:33:42.516 --> 02:33:45.098]  And they're openly setting up a world government.
[02:33:46.019 --> 02:33:48.641]  And with a world government, you're going to have a world leader.
[02:33:48.781 --> 02:33:52.084]  So, you know, the caller asked, well, how do we have this world government forming?
[02:33:52.124 --> 02:33:53.305]  Where's the Antichrist?
[02:33:53.726 --> 02:33:55.967]  Well, they're building the platform for it.
[02:33:56.588 --> 02:34:01.452]  And even if you don't believe in God and the devil and all that, they are building a tyrannical world government.
[02:34:02.192 --> 02:34:04.935]  And, you know, a book written thousands of years ago said they would.
[02:34:07.763 --> 02:34:08.544]  Very interesting.
[02:34:09.525 --> 02:34:14.650]  Police State 3 Total Enslavement is one of the best videos I've got to expose this whole paradigm.
[02:34:15.711 --> 02:34:18.213]  It's $25.95, 2 hours and 44 minutes.
[02:34:18.273 --> 02:34:20.115]  It's really 3 or 4 films in one.
[02:34:20.615 --> 02:34:27.502]  The greatest evil that mankind has ever faced is among us, a scientifically crafted global dictatorship sworn to enslave every man, woman, and child.
[02:34:28.197 --> 02:34:33.678]  The United States government at all levels has fallen under the control of the desperately wicked New World Order clan.
[02:34:34.098 --> 02:34:42.640]  The events of September 11th marked the initiation of the final sick push of the Illuminati to consolidate their One World Order and transform Earth into a prison planet.
[02:34:43.060 --> 02:34:55.443]  In over two and a half hours, I chronicle in stunning detail the true character of the globalists who learned the master plan of the bloodthirsty elite that financially, physically, and spiritually imprison not only America, but the world.
[02:34:56.457 --> 02:35:03.040]  Total Enslavement is the third installment in my critically acclaimed Police State series, and is a must-see for all who love freedom.
[02:35:03.400 --> 02:35:14.644]  This film documents the nightmare rise of Homeland Security dictatorship, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Total Information Awareness Network, government-run white slavery rings, the new prison surveillance economy, and much more.
[02:35:14.964 --> 02:35:22.707]  The very future of humanity depends on exposing government-sponsored terrorism and how the globalists pose as our saviors, when in fact they are the terrorists.
[02:35:24.661 --> 02:35:26.707]  So, that's just one of my ten videos.
[02:35:26.907 --> 02:35:30.257]  Twenty bucks when you order two additional videos when you get three or more.
[02:35:31.776 --> 02:35:47.823]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, take action, get in the game, get off the bench, get the videos, get them out to people, get them on AXS TV, get them out to opinion makers, get the books, get the t-shirts, get the bumper stickers.
[02:35:48.143 --> 02:35:51.725]  It's all about spreading the word and waking people up.
[02:35:51.825 --> 02:35:52.765]  That's the power.
[02:35:52.945 --> 02:35:54.706]  The people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:35:55.306 --> 02:35:56.407]  Here's the toll-free number.
[02:35:56.427 --> 02:35:57.288]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:57.308 --> 02:35:57.648]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:35:57.728 --> 02:36:03.512]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:36:04.012 --> 02:36:05.553]  And your support makes this show possible.
[02:36:20.763 --> 02:36:22.025]  Now, we're going to go to the loaded phones.
[02:36:22.045 --> 02:36:24.468]  They're in about four minutes, but I appreciate him holding.
[02:36:24.768 --> 02:36:26.470]  My good buddy, Jim Shepard.
[02:36:26.951 --> 02:36:28.333]  You want to take control of your life?
[02:36:28.873 --> 02:36:30.095]  70% of your body is water.
[02:36:30.676 --> 02:36:35.862]  It is now time to stop letting them poison you, which we know they're doing, through the water supply.
[02:36:35.922 --> 02:36:36.863]  Jim, good to have you on.
[02:36:36.943 --> 02:36:38.125]  Always a pleasure to be with you.
[02:36:38.445 --> 02:36:39.647]  Have you seen The Passion yet?
[02:36:40.385 --> 02:36:41.146]  No, I haven't.
[02:36:41.486 --> 02:36:46.790]  We're planning on doing that next week and taking the kids and the in-laws and just making it a big get-together.
[02:36:47.070 --> 02:36:47.271]  Good.
[02:36:47.291 --> 02:36:48.952]  That's going to be wonderful.
[02:36:49.072 --> 02:36:49.793]  Very moving.
[02:36:49.853 --> 02:36:50.974]  Best film I've ever seen.
[02:36:50.994 --> 02:36:56.578]  And it's exciting to hear Mel Gibson is going to make more biblically-based films, he said, in variety.
[02:36:57.439 --> 02:37:05.745]  Well, I think that he's really shown some real intestinal fortitude in doing this because it's not a popular thing to do.
[02:37:05.825 --> 02:37:07.687]  Well, what did Jesus say?
[02:37:07.727 --> 02:37:08.828]  He said, I wasn't popular.
[02:37:09.895 --> 02:37:11.416]  He said, he said, you're going to be persecuted.
[02:37:11.716 --> 02:37:20.622]  Well, and I think that Mel is experiencing firsthand, jeez, if he gets that much persecution just from telling the story, what about the guy who lived the story?
[02:37:20.662 --> 02:37:27.487]  It's easy to see how they crucified Christ if this is so offensive to the powers that be, so to speak.
[02:37:27.847 --> 02:37:29.988]  To say, love your neighbor as yourself.
[02:37:30.008 --> 02:37:30.969]  They're very radical.
[02:37:31.967 --> 02:37:33.768]  But it is radical to the beast system.
[02:37:34.088 --> 02:37:46.434]  How do folks protect themselves if there's hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, nuclear events, nuclear accidents, or, the reason I have it, because I don't want to drink fluoride, chlorine, pesticides, herbicides, nickel, mercury.
[02:37:48.415 --> 02:37:49.936]  How do folks protect themselves, Jim?
[02:37:50.176 --> 02:37:53.618]  Well, there's two ways that we can do it with the two specials.
[02:37:53.658 --> 02:37:54.778]  We have the Berkey light.
[02:37:55.238 --> 02:37:58.520]  Without the light, it's the basic system.
[02:37:59.256 --> 02:38:00.076]  And that is $199.
[02:38:01.897 --> 02:38:16.779]  And the special this month is if you purchase that, then we will also include a $40 sport Berkey, which gives you the power to bring the power of the Berkey with you to work and wherever you drive, a very portable little system.
[02:38:17.879 --> 02:38:24.341]  Or if you would prefer, you can replace that with a bottle of Potassium Iodate, which has 200 tablets.
[02:38:27.267 --> 02:38:31.828]  The second way, Alex, is the Berkey light with the lighting mechanism.
[02:38:31.868 --> 02:38:33.029]  These are the LED lights.
[02:38:33.049 --> 02:38:34.849]  They're very low energy, very bright.
[02:38:34.909 --> 02:38:36.129]  They'll light up a room.
[02:38:36.189 --> 02:38:39.030]  It makes a great emergency light, night light, and so forth.
[02:38:39.750 --> 02:38:41.151]  That is $259.
[02:38:41.771 --> 02:38:52.314]  And for folks that purchase that, we're going to give them two $40 Berkey sport bottles or two bottles of potassium iodate, or you can pick one of each.
[02:38:53.337 --> 02:38:55.659]  And so those are the two Berkey specials.
[02:38:55.699 --> 02:39:03.186]  Now, for folks that want to have a lot of the sport bottles on hand or give them away as gifts, we have a special for the generic sport bottles.
[02:39:03.867 --> 02:39:05.648]  These don't have our name on them.
[02:39:06.369 --> 02:39:14.136]  We make these for missionaries and so forth who just want to have a system that works, but we don't have all the fancy artwork on them.
[02:39:14.156 --> 02:39:15.858]  Those are $5 for $99, or you can get $12 for $199.
[02:39:20.487 --> 02:39:23.848]  And again, these are superior portable sport bottles.
[02:39:23.888 --> 02:39:31.849]  They'll do 630 refills on tap water, 100 and plus on lake or creek or pond water or ditch water.
[02:39:32.429 --> 02:39:33.250]  Great system.
[02:39:33.410 --> 02:39:34.190]  Good thing to have.
[02:39:34.770 --> 02:39:35.470]  Folks, it's simple.
[02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:36.750]  Stop drinking the poison.
[02:39:36.810 --> 02:39:44.912]  If you want to get out of the New World Order, if you want to start making a change, want to get off the bench, it all starts by, don't stop watching your TV shows.
[02:39:45.292 --> 02:39:46.452]  Stop drinking their water.
[02:39:47.252 --> 02:39:48.633]  Stop eating at their restaurants.
[02:39:48.733 --> 02:39:49.933]  Stop buying at their stores.
[02:39:50.533 --> 02:39:52.396]  Stop going along with their system.
[02:39:52.857 --> 02:39:57.363]  The globalists are masters of making the infrastructure be under their control.
[02:39:57.443 --> 02:40:01.769]  This is how you take water out of their control, back into your control.
[02:40:02.310 --> 02:40:05.394]  Give New Millennium Concepts a call right now at 1-888-424-9000.
[02:40:08.751 --> 02:40:10.131]  803-4438.
[02:40:10.792 --> 02:40:13.994]  And if a couple of ladies answer and the phones are busy, leave your name and number.
[02:40:14.014 --> 02:40:15.315]  They'll call you right back today.
[02:40:15.335 --> 02:40:19.898]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:40:21.059 --> 02:40:22.980]  And Jim Shepard, New Millennium Concepts.
[02:40:23.040 --> 02:40:24.381]  It's also made in America.
[02:40:24.841 --> 02:40:27.023]  And they support our global shortwave outreach.
[02:40:27.423 --> 02:40:29.684]  Six hours a day to all seven continents.
[02:40:30.425 --> 02:40:31.425]  Very important work.
[02:40:31.466 --> 02:40:32.586]  See, it's made in America.
[02:40:32.646 --> 02:40:33.307]  Great product.
[02:40:33.947 --> 02:40:36.529]  And it helps with the outreach.
[02:40:37.029 --> 02:40:38.411]  It's absolutely vital.
[02:40:38.431 --> 02:40:39.251]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:40:39.412 --> 02:40:43.435]  Jim, thanks for coming on.
[02:40:43.475 --> 02:40:44.977]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:40:45.617 --> 02:40:46.458]  You bet it, my friend.
[02:40:46.698 --> 02:40:48.720]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:40:49.441 --> 02:40:52.804]  And I know most of you haven't gotten the stuff.
[02:40:53.945 --> 02:40:57.849]  If you don't get it from them, just get a water filter, please.
[02:40:57.889 --> 02:41:00.511]  It's like, stop smoking cigarettes.
[02:41:03.533 --> 02:41:05.074]  Stop eating fast food.
[02:41:05.094 --> 02:41:07.637]  The water's even more important than that.
[02:41:08.377 --> 02:41:09.338]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:41:09.438 --> 02:41:10.359]  Thank you for holding.
[02:41:10.459 --> 02:41:11.660]  Ruth in Pennsylvania.
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:12.561]  Ruth, go ahead.
[02:41:13.041 --> 02:41:21.148]  Yes, I saw The Passion yesterday, and I have nothing but positive things to say about it, but I'd rather speak about Mel Gibson and some of the surrounding issues with it.
[02:41:22.729 --> 02:41:27.954]  I've been familiar with Mel Gibson's career since back in the late 70s and 80s and watched the films that came out then.
[02:41:28.494 --> 02:41:30.756]  Anybody who knows his work from beginning to end
[02:41:31.578 --> 02:41:33.119]  He is nothing but a good person.
[02:41:33.139 --> 02:41:37.402]  I mean, his movies, Gallipoli and Breaker Morant, are two of the best movies.
[02:41:37.603 --> 02:41:38.263]  They're powerful.
[02:41:38.303 --> 02:41:42.766]  They show character, integrity, honesty.
[02:41:42.786 --> 02:41:49.611]  He chooses, he tries to choose scripts that are uplifting, where the good guys fight against the bad guys.
[02:41:50.151 --> 02:41:59.698]  When I came home from the Passion last night, I was watching some of the criticisms, and the worst I've ever heard from the beginning of this whole controversy came on
[02:42:00.326 --> 02:42:06.849]  Educational TV on Charlie Rose Show, where he had Christopher Hutchins and a panel of journalists.
[02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:10.770]  They ripped apart the people who went to the movie, Mel Gibson.
[02:42:11.031 --> 02:42:13.492]  They didn't leave anybody unscathed.
[02:42:13.872 --> 02:42:14.432]  They were ugly.
[02:42:14.472 --> 02:42:15.432]  They were so vicious.
[02:42:16.053 --> 02:42:20.915]  They said that the only people that are going to go to this movie are right-wing Christians or get a load of this.
[02:42:21.395 --> 02:42:23.816]  People who like movies like Snuff,
[02:42:26.824 --> 02:42:30.970]  Yeah, they make movies with senseless murder.
[02:42:31.050 --> 02:42:33.173]  I mean I've sat there in movies and I've walked out.
[02:42:33.653 --> 02:42:36.918]  I went to see Natural Born Killers when I was in college.
[02:42:38.610 --> 02:42:40.331]  And we got up at the end.
[02:42:40.351 --> 02:42:42.252]  I mean, I was there with UT football players.
[02:42:43.093 --> 02:42:47.616]  And we all got up and left because they would kill police officers, kill children.
[02:42:48.296 --> 02:42:49.557]  The crowd would laugh.
[02:42:49.577 --> 02:42:50.998]  You know, you watch the crowd laugh.
[02:42:51.218 --> 02:42:52.519]  You watch these TV shows.
[02:42:52.559 --> 02:42:53.659]  They're torturing people.
[02:42:53.940 --> 02:42:54.560]  This is good.
[02:42:54.620 --> 02:42:55.561]  There's no Bill of Rights.
[02:42:55.801 --> 02:42:59.303]  That's all cute and funny, chaining somebody down and torturing them.
[02:42:59.703 --> 02:43:05.327]  And so the culture that says torture's good sees a film that's historical showing
[02:43:05.567 --> 02:43:11.051]  Somebody laying themselves down for us, and yeah, I've heard them say it's like a snot film.
[02:43:11.071 --> 02:43:11.811]  Okay, I've heard that.
[02:43:12.131 --> 02:43:15.073]  Well, you said something earlier today that I thought that was new.
[02:43:15.233 --> 02:43:16.274]  Same impression I had.
[02:43:16.294 --> 02:43:24.099]  That there's all this gratuitous violence in Hollywood, but it's not the kind of violence you feel because they shoot them, they tear them apart, but you really don't feel the suffering.
[02:43:24.439 --> 02:43:26.701]  It's like a cartoonish version of violence.
[02:43:26.741 --> 02:43:27.741]  It's a desensitization.
[02:43:27.861 --> 02:43:28.502]  Exactly.
[02:43:28.722 --> 02:43:30.503]  And they don't like this because you feel it.
[02:43:30.871 --> 02:43:31.912]  You feel the suffering.
[02:43:31.952 --> 02:43:34.474]  That suffering in this movie was very important.
[02:43:34.614 --> 02:43:35.895]  It's against violence.
[02:43:35.955 --> 02:43:36.635]  It makes us feel bad.
[02:43:36.695 --> 02:43:37.136]  Exactly.
[02:43:37.356 --> 02:43:44.782]  I guarantee you, police watching that, abusive cops that like to beat people up, aren't going to be beating as many people up after watching that.
[02:43:45.162 --> 02:43:45.702]  Exactly.
[02:43:45.742 --> 02:43:48.064]  This film is uplifting and good.
[02:43:48.144 --> 02:43:49.125]  It's a love story.
[02:43:49.385 --> 02:43:50.746]  It's a love story from Jesus.
[02:43:50.786 --> 02:43:54.969]  He says in the movie that the greatest thing you can do is to lay down your life for your friend.
[02:43:54.989 --> 02:43:55.770]  He talks about that.
[02:43:56.267 --> 02:43:58.450]  All his lines are about love and forgiveness.
[02:43:58.650 --> 02:44:00.132]  How are people missing this stuff?
[02:44:00.432 --> 02:44:01.293]  They don't talk about it.
[02:44:01.313 --> 02:44:04.076]  Well, I mean, you know, the very elect would be deceived.
[02:44:04.517 --> 02:44:06.219]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:06.679 --> 02:44:07.140]  Good points.
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:08.421]  Gary in Ohio.
[02:44:08.461 --> 02:44:09.202]  Gary, go ahead.
[02:44:09.222 --> 02:44:10.724]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:12.134 --> 02:44:13.315]  Ruth just stole my thunder.
[02:44:13.355 --> 02:44:15.315]  I was going to point out that Charlie Rosen interview.
[02:44:15.355 --> 02:44:25.538]  I couldn't believe how callous those... I saw a... I forget, it was some rabbi from the ADL a few months ago called it a snuff film.
[02:44:25.578 --> 02:44:26.859]  It was on the O'Reilly Factor.
[02:44:29.940 --> 02:44:31.240]  That's really ridiculous.
[02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:39.743]  The reason I called is that I had been watching my local news and they had two broadcasters, a pre-release
[02:44:40.744 --> 02:44:45.105]  A showing of it, a church group had sponsored it, and of course everybody was very, very positive.
[02:44:45.425 --> 02:44:49.466]  Now last night, when it actually opened for the public, they interviewed people again.
[02:44:49.486 --> 02:44:51.347]  Some of them were Christians, but some of them were not.
[02:44:51.487 --> 02:44:55.688]  But yet, amazingly, everyone had a very, very positive reaction.
[02:44:55.708 --> 02:44:56.608]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:44:56.728 --> 02:44:57.528]  Let me tell you a story.
[02:44:59.609 --> 02:45:01.549]  I got there at 3 o'clock with my cousin.
[02:45:02.809 --> 02:45:03.930]  My wife hasn't seen it yet.
[02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:05.730]  She wants to go when the crowds aren't so big.
[02:45:06.864 --> 02:45:10.545]  She can't stand watching a movie with 15 crying kids, which is what happened.
[02:45:11.365 --> 02:45:23.248]  But, I'm sitting there, and as we get in there, sit down at 3 o'clock, good seats, I walk outside and I watch for 15 minutes CBS and Fox interviewing people.
[02:45:23.908 --> 02:45:26.049]  And they would, it's the same thing we saw at the airport.
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:28.841]  You know, oh, do you like security?
[02:45:28.901 --> 02:45:33.224]  Forty-something people say no, it's a fraud, they find one old lady who loves it, that's on the news.
[02:45:33.865 --> 02:45:39.888]  I watched Fox and CBS sit there and interview, in the fifteen minutes, had to be twenty, thirty people.
[02:45:40.349 --> 02:45:46.973]  When they finally got one person who didn't like it, guess what was on the news last night?
[02:45:47.173 --> 02:45:48.434]  The one person who didn't like it?
[02:45:48.494 --> 02:45:51.936]  So, I mean, yeah, time and time again, we watch this happen.
[02:45:52.416 --> 02:45:56.319]  So yeah, they had massive trouble finding somebody that didn't like it,
[02:45:57.109 --> 02:46:08.813]  And, you know, I saw hippies, I saw, you know, the stoners, I saw the conservatives, I saw blacks, whites, Hispanics, Catholics, you know, with the cross on the head deal for yesterday.
[02:46:09.194 --> 02:46:10.274]  I saw everybody there.
[02:46:11.675 --> 02:46:14.756]  And so for them to try that is a total fraud.
[02:46:14.896 --> 02:46:18.977]  You know, to try to say, oh well, you know, it's just one little group.
[02:46:19.458 --> 02:46:23.259]  What's funny is it's obvious it's a total fraud and people are catching on to that.
[02:46:24.355 --> 02:46:26.396]  And it's going to backfire on them, I guarantee it.
[02:46:26.536 --> 02:46:28.577]  That's exactly what's happened is it's blown up in their face.
[02:46:28.617 --> 02:46:29.157]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:30.038 --> 02:46:32.679]  Let's talk to Don in Indiana.
[02:46:32.719 --> 02:46:33.379]  Don, go ahead.
[02:46:35.540 --> 02:46:36.680]  Good to talk to you, Don.
[02:46:36.700 --> 02:46:37.401]  You're on the air.
[02:46:37.421 --> 02:46:39.601]  Okay, Don's gone.
[02:46:40.342 --> 02:46:41.802]  Let's talk to Dan in Oklahoma.
[02:46:41.822 --> 02:46:42.583]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:46:43.123 --> 02:46:43.983]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:46:44.023 --> 02:46:44.363]  Good.
[02:46:44.463 --> 02:46:50.326]  My family last night and my daughter's agnostic boyfriend.
[02:46:51.046 --> 02:46:53.267]  And let me tell you, it was something else.
[02:46:53.743 --> 02:46:57.004]  I mean, everybody that walked out of there was so somber looking.
[02:46:57.625 --> 02:46:58.265]  It really hit them.
[02:46:58.865 --> 02:47:04.647]  But during the entire movie, it was quiet, except for the point where he stepped on the serpent's head.
[02:47:05.047 --> 02:47:06.428]  And then some G.I.
[02:47:06.448 --> 02:47:08.169]  behind me shouted, All right!
[02:47:08.389 --> 02:47:09.629]  And then the rest of the crowd did.
[02:47:09.649 --> 02:47:11.530]  But after that, it was just really quiet.
[02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:15.111]  And I mean, people weren't leaving to go get popcorn.
[02:47:15.171 --> 02:47:15.771]  Just the kids.
[02:47:16.312 --> 02:47:17.132]  They might go get it.
[02:47:17.212 --> 02:47:18.613]  But everybody else was scared.
[02:47:18.753 --> 02:47:20.673]  I mean, they didn't want to miss a scene.
[02:47:21.334 --> 02:47:22.114]  And all of the
[02:47:23.206 --> 02:47:27.307]  Theaters, they showed three here at Fort Sill and all of them were full.
[02:47:28.167 --> 02:47:32.549]  And there was people, like I said, agnostic atheists that wanted to go see this thing.
[02:47:33.269 --> 02:47:42.171]  But I could see it really hit him hard, because he had been in denial that Jesus Christ had walked the earth and all this other stuff.
[02:47:42.652 --> 02:47:46.353]  Oh, people still deny that despite all the historians that were there on scene.
[02:47:47.453 --> 02:47:51.214]  I mean, the Roman histories say this guy did rise again and
[02:47:52.066 --> 02:47:53.427]  This stuff really happened, folks.
[02:47:53.447 --> 02:47:55.108]  There's a reason people follow.
[02:47:56.709 --> 02:48:01.992]  The world just can't stand it, but it shows what making a stand, putting out good material can do.
[02:48:02.092 --> 02:48:04.813]  It can really counter the globalists.
[02:48:05.534 --> 02:48:10.697]  Your agnostic friend, did he wake up or did he cry?
[02:48:11.837 --> 02:48:13.318]  No, it looked like he was in shock.
[02:48:13.999 --> 02:48:14.919]  That's what it looked like.
[02:48:14.939 --> 02:48:17.781]  I can't believe the suffering this man went through.
[02:48:18.655 --> 02:48:23.498]  Well, I want people to know that the globalist enforcers do that to other people every day.
[02:48:25.039 --> 02:48:25.880]  To the innocents.
[02:48:26.420 --> 02:48:29.242]  And I want people to know that that's what the New World Order is all about.
[02:48:29.262 --> 02:48:30.723]  What you saw those Romans doing.
[02:48:30.983 --> 02:48:32.084]  They want to do that again.
[02:48:32.104 --> 02:48:35.546]  And that's why all these TV shows promote torture and promote evil.
[02:48:35.666 --> 02:48:37.067]  They're trying to bring that back in.
[02:48:37.087 --> 02:48:38.408]  And that's what we're fighting.
[02:48:38.428 --> 02:48:39.148]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:41.009 --> 02:48:43.051]  Let's go back to Don now that he's back.
[02:48:43.091 --> 02:48:43.831]  Don, go ahead.
[02:48:43.851 --> 02:48:45.412]  Hello, Alex.
[02:48:45.632 --> 02:48:45.852]  Yes.
[02:48:46.753 --> 02:48:48.094]  I saw that film last night.
[02:48:49.463 --> 02:48:50.664]  If you want to call it a film.
[02:48:51.284 --> 02:48:53.085]  It was more of an experience, I felt.
[02:48:53.105 --> 02:48:53.625]  Yeah, it was.
[02:48:54.005 --> 02:48:56.406]  Things haven't changed much in 2,000 years, have they?
[02:48:56.426 --> 02:49:06.351]  That one part about Satan carrying the child around in a crowd, what do you think the significance of that was?
[02:49:06.531 --> 02:49:08.592]  Where it turned out to be an evil man?
[02:49:09.332 --> 02:49:12.493]  It was just, you know, symbolism of just
[02:49:14.696 --> 02:49:15.256]  Demonic.
[02:49:15.517 --> 02:49:16.097]  Very deep.
[02:49:16.177 --> 02:49:17.438]  I thought about that as well.
[02:49:17.998 --> 02:49:18.438]  My what?
[02:49:18.979 --> 02:49:22.761]  Is it, you know, showing Christ has got his children, the devil's got his children.
[02:49:23.121 --> 02:49:24.242]  That's what I thought, too.
[02:49:25.202 --> 02:49:37.710]  The literary license that he took in reference to the raven that plucked the eye out of one of the thieves, I was reading once in a comic, Crucifixions, and I guess that they did have a problem with ravens.
[02:49:38.410 --> 02:49:39.271]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:49:39.311 --> 02:49:42.193]  The birds did pull people's eyes out while they were still alive.
[02:49:42.233 --> 02:49:42.593]  That's him.
[02:49:43.453 --> 02:49:46.435]  I mean, look, I've read accounts of cat or nine tails on ships.
[02:49:46.535 --> 02:49:47.476]  That's what it does.
[02:49:47.997 --> 02:49:49.298]  But normally you get, you know, 10, 20.
[02:49:50.258 --> 02:49:51.740]  Over 20 generally kills you.
[02:49:52.220 --> 02:49:52.380]  Yeah.
[02:49:52.600 --> 02:49:54.502]  If somebody's really swinging a real cat or nine.
[02:49:55.623 --> 02:49:57.944]  Well, what do you think about children seeing this movie?
[02:49:58.265 --> 02:49:58.985]  I think they should.
[02:50:00.603 --> 02:50:04.285]  I mean, when I was five years old, I was shooting deer and gutting them.
[02:50:04.345 --> 02:50:05.305]  I mean, we need to know.
[02:50:05.325 --> 02:50:10.928]  I don't like, I've always said, I don't like violence that is pointless or that is glorified.
[02:50:11.268 --> 02:50:12.289]  You know, indiscriminate.
[02:50:12.429 --> 02:50:15.870]  This is good because it shows us what reality is.
[02:50:17.451 --> 02:50:19.312]  What part of that movie is most gripping to you?
[02:50:21.373 --> 02:50:22.874]  I have to say the counter nine tails.
[02:50:22.994 --> 02:50:23.654]  Yeah, nine tails.
[02:50:24.194 --> 02:50:25.235]  Yeah, and then hauling him up.
[02:50:26.539 --> 02:50:30.062]  For some reason it was the walk with the cross that really affected me.
[02:50:30.402 --> 02:50:39.529]  Well, I think, you know, when Christ gives up the ghost and, you know, in a way, how beautiful His face is in that surrender after the sacrifice.
[02:50:39.549 --> 02:50:44.052]  I mean, that one frame of cellulose.
[02:50:45.945 --> 02:50:48.828]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[02:50:48.848 --> 02:50:50.830]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[02:50:51.030 --> 02:50:56.656]  Cheaperhotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.

[02:52:44.599 --> 02:52:48.902]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:52:49.122 --> 02:52:53.545]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:52:53.685 --> 02:52:54.926]  There is a chance
[02:52:55.458 --> 02:52:58.060]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:52:58.100 --> 02:53:00.981]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:53:01.222 --> 02:53:05.444]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:53:05.524 --> 02:53:12.449]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:53:12.569 --> 02:53:14.590]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:53:35.919 --> 02:53:37.620]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:53:51.104 --> 02:53:57.247]  You know, I don't think that you can say one part is more gripping or more deep than another.
[02:53:57.267 --> 02:54:05.552]  I mean, I would agree with what Don was saying, where Christ falls down hauling the cross and his mother runs up to him and she sees him as a little boy.
[02:54:05.572 --> 02:54:07.413]  I mean, that is very intense.
[02:54:08.033 --> 02:54:11.635]  And you know how grueling it is when he's hauling the cross around.
[02:54:11.975 --> 02:54:15.177]  Don, real quick, finish up because I'm going to try to cram a few more in here.
[02:54:16.337 --> 02:54:19.339]  Okay, I just want to say that I'd recommend that film for everyone.
[02:54:20.037 --> 02:54:29.304]  I believe God's going to use this to bring in the final harvest of Christianity around the world, and what is going to take place is going to take place.
[02:54:29.945 --> 02:54:30.966]  I think it really helps.
[02:54:31.026 --> 02:54:33.348]  I think it's overall a very uplifting and a good thing.
[02:54:33.368 --> 02:54:34.488]  Thanks, Don.
[02:54:35.129 --> 02:54:37.050]  Let's talk to Howard in Michigan.
[02:54:37.111 --> 02:54:37.851]  Go ahead, Howard.
[02:54:38.352 --> 02:54:38.812]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:39.232 --> 02:54:40.093]  Thanks for all you do.
[02:54:40.413 --> 02:54:40.874]  Thank you.
[02:54:41.394 --> 02:54:43.556]  I'm calling regarding the Senate bill.
[02:54:45.095 --> 02:54:47.756]  659 regarding the lawsuit for the gun manufacturers?
[02:54:47.916 --> 02:54:48.336]  Oh, yes.
[02:54:48.756 --> 02:54:54.318]  Yeah, I missed the first part of your show, so you might have already hit this, but they've tied two amendments to that bill.
[02:54:54.338 --> 02:55:02.400]  Yeah, they've tied gun control to the gun show loophole, they've shut down the gun shows, and they've tied the assault weapons ban back to it.
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:02.900]  Right.
[02:55:02.920 --> 02:55:08.902]  So anybody that called their senators and told them they wanted them to vote for it, they better call and tell them not to.
[02:55:09.182 --> 02:55:11.703]  Tell them we are going to put up with another hatred act.
[02:55:14.662 --> 02:55:16.183]  Absolutely, good to hear from you.
[02:55:16.403 --> 02:55:16.963]  Okay, thanks.
[02:55:17.123 --> 02:55:17.483]  You bet.
[02:55:17.803 --> 02:55:18.824]  Wanda in Texas.
[02:55:18.904 --> 02:55:19.784]  Wanda, go ahead.
[02:55:20.765 --> 02:55:22.265]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[02:55:23.006 --> 02:55:29.628]  I want to bring an issue to the attention of the people down here in West Texas, around Colorado City, Texas.
[02:55:29.768 --> 02:55:30.088]  Okay.
[02:55:30.429 --> 02:55:32.469]  We've got Attorney Pat Barber down here.
[02:55:33.110 --> 02:55:36.671]  Yeah, he put the sign up on his land saying, stay out of checkpoints.
[02:55:37.091 --> 02:55:37.532]  Right.
[02:55:37.772 --> 02:55:40.753]  Well, he took it to the Texas Supreme Court and lost.
[02:55:41.471 --> 02:55:43.212]  But now he's took it to the U.S.
[02:55:43.312 --> 02:55:44.153]  Supreme Court.
[02:55:44.373 --> 02:55:52.499]  Yeah, they say on his own property, McDonald's can have a sign on their own property on the highway there, but he can't have a sign on his own ranch saying you got a Fourth Amendment.
[02:55:52.779 --> 02:55:54.440]  Well, he just had a great win in the U.S.
[02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:55.341]  Supreme Court.
[02:55:55.681 --> 02:55:56.262]  He did?
[02:55:56.422 --> 02:55:56.962]  Yes, he did.
[02:55:57.042 --> 02:55:58.463]  And I emailed it to you.
[02:55:58.903 --> 02:55:59.724]  And they said he can.
[02:55:59.824 --> 02:56:04.787]  Now, he's going to be putting up billboards down 20 and have everybody sign them.
[02:56:04.828 --> 02:56:08.190]  Now, this is on the Fourth Amendment for searches and seizures.
[02:56:08.823 --> 02:56:09.564]  Good, good.
[02:56:09.664 --> 02:56:13.646]  I have talked with his office and they would like to get on your show.
[02:56:14.027 --> 02:56:14.347]  Okay.
[02:56:15.027 --> 02:56:16.428]  I had him on a few years ago.
[02:56:17.389 --> 02:56:20.952]  Please email me or call with his number and I'll get Pat Barber back on.
[02:56:20.972 --> 02:56:22.172]  Okay, I sure will.
[02:56:22.213 --> 02:56:22.533]  Thank you.
[02:56:22.573 --> 02:56:23.213]  You're awesome.
[02:56:23.253 --> 02:56:23.754]  Thank you.
[02:56:23.914 --> 02:56:24.694]  Final call.
[02:56:25.795 --> 02:56:26.836]  Let's talk to Jeff.
[02:56:26.996 --> 02:56:29.077]  Jeff, where are you calling us from?
[02:56:29.578 --> 02:56:30.098]  Montana.
[02:56:30.358 --> 02:56:30.719]  Go ahead.
[02:56:30.779 --> 02:56:32.540]  You've got the tail gunner spot.
[02:56:33.100 --> 02:56:33.400]  Oh, cool.
[02:56:34.813 --> 02:56:38.754]  That movie was an experience that everybody has to see.
[02:56:40.175 --> 02:56:43.776]  During the Ketamine, I actually had water.
[02:56:43.816 --> 02:56:45.316]  I mean, I was sweating so hard.
[02:56:46.537 --> 02:56:47.457]  My shirt was soaked.
[02:56:48.297 --> 02:56:49.497]  I was just ripping down it.
[02:56:50.058 --> 02:56:53.258]  And by the way, there's lots of stuff more violent in other movies.
[02:56:53.399 --> 02:56:54.839]  Why is this so intense?
[02:56:54.899 --> 02:57:00.101]  Because our soul knows it's real and knows how important this is.
[02:57:00.921 --> 02:57:01.481]  True, true.
[02:57:01.957 --> 02:57:06.342]  And one of the other callers was talking about the child.
[02:57:08.225 --> 02:57:15.173]  I foresaw that as Satan trying to get Jesus to renounce the Lord.
[02:57:15.857 --> 02:57:17.678]  And say, see, I take care of my child.
[02:57:17.718 --> 02:57:20.000]  See how my child hugs me and loves me?
[02:57:20.300 --> 02:57:20.881]  Exactly!
[02:57:20.941 --> 02:57:24.964]  That's, it was the devil, a good point, making fun and saying, see, your father's forsaken you.
[02:57:24.984 --> 02:57:25.864]  Thanks, thanks for the call.
[02:57:26.425 --> 02:57:27.405]  A great, great point.
[02:57:27.465 --> 02:57:28.206]  I didn't think of that.
[02:57:28.926 --> 02:57:29.627]  I agree, that's it.
[02:57:30.047 --> 02:57:30.527]  You're right.
[02:57:30.888 --> 02:57:32.229]  Putting our minds together here.
[02:57:33.109 --> 02:57:36.432]  Out of time, back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:57:36.452 --> 02:57:40.915]  And back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central during the day.
[02:57:40.975 --> 02:57:41.895]  Great broadcast.
[02:57:44.097 --> 02:57:45.318]  And, well,
[02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:49.971]  Durable goods orders, log surprise, drop in January, USA Today.
[02:57:49.991 --> 02:57:58.433]  Orders for durable manufactured goods dropped unexpectedly in January, as demand for aircraft and cars fell sharply, government reports showed, on Thursday.
[02:57:58.733 --> 02:58:03.114]  And the dollar's plunging more, but it's all part of the plan.
[02:58:03.134 --> 02:58:06.454]  They tell you how good the economy is, in reality, it's unraveling.
[02:58:07.394 --> 02:58:09.955]  Greenspan says, hey, we gotta go ahead and take your social security.
[02:58:10.575 --> 02:58:14.336]  They already stole your money, folks, and now they're getting ready to take all your welfare away.
[02:58:15.700 --> 02:58:19.324]  If you'd have kept your own money, you'd have millions of dollars, but now you get nothing.
[02:58:20.686 --> 02:58:22.148]  So this is part of the enslavement.
[02:58:22.208 --> 02:58:25.772]  Get us addicted to government, then go to the fascist model and take it all away.
[02:58:25.792 --> 02:58:27.814]  I'm out of time.
[02:58:27.854 --> 02:58:29.216]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:58:29.256 --> 02:58:31.719]  Back tomorrow, get out there and stand up against evil.
[02:58:31.959 --> 02:58:32.880]  Be part of history.
[02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:34.322]  Make your life really matter.
[02:58:36.172 --> 02:58:46.897]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:58:47.077 --> 02:58:54.621]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:58:54.921 --> 02:58:58.063]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:58:58.323 --> 02:59:04.107]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:59:04.348 --> 02:59:10.532]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:59:10.873 --> 02:59:14.775]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:59:14.815 --> 02:59:16.697]  The water level is always visible.
[02:59:16.897 --> 02:59:22.841]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
