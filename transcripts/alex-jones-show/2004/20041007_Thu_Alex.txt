[00:00:05.833 --> 00:00:06.453]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.174]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:09.994]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:11.494]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.514 --> 00:00:14.155]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:17.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.975 --> 00:00:22.136]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.897 --> 00:00:31.418]  The electronic prison is being formed all around us.
[00:00:33.504 --> 00:00:42.974]  Where as 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago I would talk about the satellite tracking transponder taxation systems that would be in all the cars and people would laugh at me.
[00:00:43.534 --> 00:00:47.578]  I'd talk about the federal plans to put a microchip in every single American.
[00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.020]  People would laugh at me.
[00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.602]  Now they don't laugh because it's on the nightly news.
[00:00:53.084 --> 00:00:55.026]  Take implantable microchips though.
[00:00:55.066 --> 00:00:55.987]  We're being conditioned.
[00:00:56.638 --> 00:01:03.543]  Whereas we all freaked out and ran around pulling our hair out a couple years ago when the news started saying, shouldn't all the children have it?
[00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:05.644]  Shouldn't the Alzheimer's patients have it?
[00:01:06.004 --> 00:01:07.746]  Then I saw the company's own documents.
[00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:20.775]  They plan with the governments of the world to make prisoners take it, and VIP people take it, and folks that get into high security areas take it, and the military take it, and now it's all over the news that our special forces have already gotten chips.
[00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.676]  They're not supposed to talk about it.
[00:01:23.544 --> 00:01:24.805]  That's now mainstream news.
[00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:27.948]  And, oh, there's TV over in Europe.
[00:01:27.988 --> 00:01:31.752]  We've got the newscast up on the website and the news articles about it.
[00:01:31.772 --> 00:01:35.435]  Oh, we want to make the prisoners and the criminals and the VIPers take it.
[00:01:35.475 --> 00:01:39.519]  And first 300, then 600, and now even more people.
[00:01:39.559 --> 00:01:45.604]  If you want to work in the Mexican Justice Department, you've got to take it in Mexico if you want to work there.
[00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:47.887]  And now it's spreading out to the police force.
[00:01:48.647 --> 00:01:49.288]  It's happening.
[00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:57.285]  Governments are enticing people, as I predicted, not hard to do, through peer pressure that it's stylish and cool to have chips.
[00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:58.466]  That's one prong of it.
[00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:06.748]  And then, of course, making you have it to have high security jobs, and then prisoners, and then the military, who's really prisoners of this criminal New World Order.
[00:02:06.788 --> 00:02:07.969]  They're forced to do it as well.
[00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.970]  It's like they're forced to breathe depleted uranium and take experimental vaccines.
[00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:18.492]  And now the news admits, oh, there is a move to make everybody.
[00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:24.432]  Put a transponder chip in your car that tracks and traces you and taxes you everywhere.
[00:02:25.193 --> 00:02:32.159]  And of course this has come out in the different financial websites of the companies promoting this, but now World Net Daily has written an article about it.
[00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:34.081]  Federal government preparing to make you do it.
[00:02:34.742 --> 00:02:43.330]  You see, it's not just the electronic tolls to get on any major road in Austin, it's going in nationwide, statewide, by state, by state.
[00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:51.067]  Ah, the grid is going in and the average person is not tuned in to the reality that surrounds them.
[00:02:51.087 --> 00:03:00.255]  They just accept whatever the new changes are as if they're a rat dumped into a maze, living their lives out, never trying to change the world around them.
[00:03:01.336 --> 00:03:02.918]  Well, we stand against it all.
[00:03:02.978 --> 00:03:06.381]  I mean, shouldn't we be upset about the tyranny that's around us?
[00:03:06.421 --> 00:03:07.542]  Shouldn't we be angry?
[00:03:07.942 --> 00:03:09.524]  Shouldn't we be speaking out against it?
[00:03:10.712 --> 00:03:12.994]  Isn't that the normal response?
[00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:14.795]  To be threatened by it?
[00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:20.740]  To see the electronic cage with the physical enforcers to back it up being put into place?
[00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:30.928]  Meanwhile, more and more the military systems going into automated systems and robotic control through AI computer networks.
[00:03:30.988 --> 00:03:32.109]  What's the danger of that?
[00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.230]  It allows tiny elites to control entire societies.
[00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:47.794]  That's the one thing that's been holding the globalists back, is they don't have enough criminal enforcers, nemesis enforcers, to carry out their criminal aims, their psychopathic aims.
[00:03:48.515 --> 00:03:57.518]  But under automation, under pre-programmed parameters, it can be carried out to their exacting design.
[00:03:58.578 --> 00:04:01.299]  We face the end of the species as we know it,
[00:04:02.006 --> 00:04:05.949]  In the next 50 years, we will be molded into the Suboid Slave Class.
[00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:14.934]  We will be genetically reconfigured, forcibly drugged at birth, psychologically tested, screened, stamped, numbered.
[00:04:15.935 --> 00:04:19.577]  And the first horrible phases of that are now in place.
[00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:29.143]  This is the official plan, and if you wish to stand against it, you are welcome to, I beg you to, or you can submit
[00:04:29.884 --> 00:04:54.901]  To the powers of the New World Order and resign yourself and your family and your progeny and the human species to being basically put into slave pens to be fed on and exterminated by the psychopathic derivation that is the overlord species of criminal degenerates now caging their subspecies slaves.
[00:04:54.941 --> 00:04:55.602]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.338 --> 00:05:05.681]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.841 --> 00:05:10.283]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.423 --> 00:05:14.806]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.846 --> 00:05:16.227]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.967 --> 00:05:17.907]  Panama!
[00:05:17.987 --> 00:05:22.208]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.268 --> 00:05:29.190]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.371]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:42.053]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.313 --> 00:05:45.074]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:45.434]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.078 --> 00:06:02.698]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.838 --> 00:06:06.919]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:09.960]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:16.762]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.922 --> 00:06:19.942]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.142 --> 00:06:22.523]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.663 --> 00:06:30.545]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:06:30.865 --> 00:06:42.128]  Methazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:42.288 --> 00:06:51.091]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.111 --> 00:06:51.311]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:52.971]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:07:00.387 --> 00:07:06.675]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:07:07.055 --> 00:07:11.160]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:18.870]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:26.759]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:29.342]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:32.946]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort.
[00:07:33.326 --> 00:07:36.510]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:39.694]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:07:40.194 --> 00:07:45.279]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[00:07:45.459 --> 00:07:48.402]  Because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[00:07:48.782 --> 00:07:50.283]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[00:07:50.343 --> 00:07:52.685]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com Big Brother.
[00:08:07.165 --> 00:08:08.186]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.927 --> 00:08:10.028]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:11.509]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.150]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:17.474]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:22.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:30.685]  Alright, my friends, it is Thursday, the seventh day of October 2004.
[00:08:30.805 --> 00:08:31.726]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:36.343 --> 00:08:39.444]  I want to go over the dehumanization slave grid.
[00:08:41.564 --> 00:08:46.665]  Then I want to get into all the latest Iraq, Patriot Act 2.5, all of it.
[00:08:47.165 --> 00:09:01.047]  In fact, I call it Patriot Act 2.5 because, again, parts of Patriot Act 2, small portions, but important areas of it, were passed back on December 13, 2003 in the Intelligence Enhancement Act.
[00:09:01.728 --> 00:09:02.908]  They introduced it, what,
[00:09:04.994 --> 00:09:14.481]  11 months before, or 10 and a half months before, as Patriot Act II, the Domestic Security Enhancement Act, and then denied it even existed.
[00:09:16.383 --> 00:09:25.269]  And now they've introduced all those other provisions they didn't pass in this new 9-11 bill, as well as the Total Information Awareness Network, which never went away, but more funding for it.
[00:09:25.289 --> 00:09:28.492]  That's the NSA tracking and controlling the American people.
[00:09:29.227 --> 00:09:40.011]  And then on top of it, a new super national ID card with now the mainstream media admitting it's not just going to have the strip, the biometric photo, and the thumb scan, which most states already have under federal control.
[00:09:40.992 --> 00:09:45.834]  And the Texas Department of Transportation here in Texas already says national ID card in their internal computers.
[00:09:46.114 --> 00:09:50.075]  We now have videos from inside of the computer screens, aired those earlier this week.
[00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:51.136]  That's on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:09:52.596 --> 00:09:58.299]  But now it's going to have a trackable RFID chip that can be read from several hundred feet.
[00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:05.202]  And by law, all cars will have to have a large transponder or K-Tag type system in them to be tracked as well.
[00:10:05.702 --> 00:10:08.264]  This is all mainstream news, out in the open.
[00:10:09.144 --> 00:10:11.365]  And again, it was all in the federal documents many years ago.
[00:10:11.405 --> 00:10:12.325]  I made films about it.
[00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:14.266]  I'm not tooting my own horn.
[00:10:14.366 --> 00:10:15.747]  I just read the federal documents.
[00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:17.488]  It's the industry documents.
[00:10:17.728 --> 00:10:19.729]  It's not... None of this is fiction.
[00:10:21.508 --> 00:10:30.594]  And no matter how wild the stuff we talk about here on this broadcast sounds, it is always rooted in public statements, declassified documents, public documents, legislation.
[00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:34.957]  Public officials and authorities own statements.
[00:10:36.418 --> 00:10:46.785]  When we read the Army War College in January of 2000 saying that the main job of the military by 2025 will be implanting everyone with a microchip in their brain to control them,
[00:10:47.651 --> 00:10:48.772]  We like to pay attention.
[00:10:49.073 --> 00:10:49.933]  Sounds insane?
[00:10:50.014 --> 00:10:51.455]  It's on the Pentagon website.
[00:10:51.935 --> 00:10:57.041]  They got very angry later at the military for releasing that, even though they were ordered to release it.
[00:10:57.581 --> 00:11:00.885]  They got mad at the Federation of American Scientists for posting it on their website.
[00:11:01.465 --> 00:11:05.750]  The Hive Mind article, a lengthy U.S.
[00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.755]  government development plan going off the last 20 years, was declassified two and a half years ago.
[00:11:11.494 --> 00:11:28.685]  And picked up by the Associated Press and the Sydney Morning Herald and a few other major papers around the globe and said that we'll all have our brain chips and be hooked in and you'll have to have it to have a job or even communicate with people and live and it's the next phase of human evolution and I've interviewed UT professors here in Austin who talk about this.
[00:11:28.705 --> 00:11:33.048]  In fact, one of them is even in the film Waking Life that Richard Linklater made that I'm in.
[00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.090]  This is what's being discussed.
[00:11:36.331 --> 00:11:38.252]  That's why I say two separate species.
[00:11:40.169 --> 00:11:46.290]  By that, the globalists... Well, let's go over some history, because this sounds crazy unless you look at the facts.
[00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:48.331]  Number one, we're in 2004.
[00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:54.832]  We're not in 1965, back when this was being written about in science fiction books.
[00:11:55.212 --> 00:11:57.613]  We're not in 1915, when H.G.
[00:11:57.653 --> 00:11:59.033]  Wells was writing about stuff like this.
[00:12:00.953 --> 00:12:05.494]  We're not in 1969, when Frank Herbert's putting out Doom.
[00:12:07.375 --> 00:12:08.335]  We're in 2004, my friends.
[00:12:11.516 --> 00:12:13.717]  We're in 2004.
[00:12:17.098 --> 00:12:18.919]  And we are back to the future.
[00:12:18.999 --> 00:12:19.679]  We are here.
[00:12:19.759 --> 00:12:20.380]  We are in it.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:21.300]  We are living in it.
[00:12:22.821 --> 00:12:24.381]  And so let's go over some history.
[00:12:25.302 --> 00:12:28.463]  Elites have always gone quite mad.
[00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:31.871]  They always get megalomaniacal.
[00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:45.866]  You may even have a good philosopher king who helps the people and escalates education and wants to free the human spirit and doesn't want to enslave, but always those mechanisms of centralized power are there and his son or his daughter or their daughter or son
[00:12:46.526 --> 00:12:52.747]  Uh, gets on a total power trip as a spoiled brat and starts saying, um, you know, crucify 10,000 of the slaves.
[00:12:52.767 --> 00:12:53.668]  They looked at me wrong.
[00:12:54.348 --> 00:12:56.908]  Um, you know, I don't care how many of them die building my pyramids.
[00:12:57.628 --> 00:13:03.770]  Uh, throw their slave children into this, uh, Molok Owl deity because I think it gives me power.
[00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:14.712]  Uh, I'm going to marry my horse and fire the Senate and we're going to gut pigs on the Senate floor and look at their guts and I'm going to roll around in them and decide what to do next.
[00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:16.751]  I mean, this is just history.
[00:13:18.312 --> 00:13:21.154]  And if that's the norm, is people go crazy.
[00:13:21.715 --> 00:13:24.077]  No one's challenging Stalin, he has total control.
[00:13:24.797 --> 00:13:28.720]  And so he purges almost his entire military and kills most of his underlings.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.303]  And kills tens of millions of his own people for no reason.
[00:13:32.323 --> 00:13:35.845]  Other than the fact that he's evil and enjoys evil.
[00:13:36.086 --> 00:13:38.728]  That's why he was able to be ruthless and get into that position of power.
[00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:40.469]  Why did Hitler do what he did?
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:54.869]  Brought Germany back from the brink of economic disaster or implosion and had everybody worshipping him and suddenly he attacks everyone and starts slaughtering innocent people but destroys his own empire.
[00:13:56.658 --> 00:13:58.139]  What did we do to the Native Americans?
[00:13:58.159 --> 00:14:00.240]  What did we do to black people in this country?
[00:14:00.821 --> 00:14:02.502]  I mean, just look at history, folks!
[00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:06.564]  Stop being... And we look at governments today and go, oh, they're all loving and nice!
[00:14:06.804 --> 00:14:08.065]  Let's do whatever they say!
[00:14:08.125 --> 00:14:09.505]  Let's give them unlimited power!
[00:14:09.785 --> 00:14:12.327]  Let's give them unlimited control over our lives!
[00:14:14.788 --> 00:14:23.193]  And so, throughout history, power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely, as Lord Acton said, or was it Edmund Burke?
[00:14:23.333 --> 00:14:25.454]  I always get those quotes.
[00:14:26.295 --> 00:14:26.976]  I'm mixed up.
[00:14:27.837 --> 00:14:30.499]  But that's what goes on.
[00:14:32.602 --> 00:14:36.165]  And we know about our government dealing the drugs and licensing drugs.
[00:14:36.185 --> 00:14:37.266]  They know brain damage people.
[00:14:37.286 --> 00:14:42.812]  We know about the government eugenics experiments, developing the systems that Hitler actually grabbed hold of and adopted.
[00:14:43.795 --> 00:14:48.097]  We know about all of the genetic engineering, a lot of it that's going on.
[00:14:48.117 --> 00:14:51.978]  We know about the biological weapons development of race-specific systems by our own government.
[00:14:52.338 --> 00:15:03.182]  We know about them messing around with antimatter, despite the fact that top physicists and quantum mechanic experts say that messing with it could actually destroy the entire planet, or perhaps the solar system, or worse.
[00:15:05.383 --> 00:15:08.944]  You know, makes hydrogen bombs look like pop guns compared to hydrogen bombs.
[00:15:09.764 --> 00:15:11.145]  That's the scale of difference here.
[00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:21.416]  And these people are in their ivory towers, and they just cannot deal with the fact that they've gone quite criminally insane.
[00:15:22.036 --> 00:15:30.281]  And they've got all these yes-men and women around them, and they think they're God, and they've got this excuse to enslave the planet, to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
[00:15:30.621 --> 00:15:31.302]  That's their excuse.
[00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:32.382]  They sell their underlings.
[00:15:32.623 --> 00:15:36.205]  Meanwhile, they proliferate the weapons to create the global crisis, to bring in their global government.
[00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:48.369]  Meanwhile, they engage in experiments in wanton abandon that could destroy the entire life sphere, biosphere, food chain connectivity, and inter-species relationships.
[00:15:50.109 --> 00:15:52.590]  One example I like to use, because it's public, is protegene.
[00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:58.751]  Texas company, three years ago, 96 open locations, planted pharmacological corn that grows live AIDS virus in it.
[00:15:59.051 --> 00:16:00.191]  It's spread into soybeans.
[00:16:00.752 --> 00:16:01.472]  That's all we know.
[00:16:01.492 --> 00:16:02.732]  Details remain classified.
[00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.473]  This is the type of stuff we deal with!
[00:16:08.041 --> 00:16:10.962]  And, uh, there's hundreds of examples.
[00:16:11.223 --> 00:16:12.363]  So where am I going with this?
[00:16:14.304 --> 00:16:18.566]  The elite have said that they're going to track and trace and tax everything we do.
[00:16:19.026 --> 00:16:23.288]  They are going to forcibly, psychologically test and forcibly drug the entire population.
[00:16:23.668 --> 00:16:28.790]  They are going to put upwards of 30 million people in prison, and they made that promise years ago, and they're already up to 7 million, or 1.3 million.
[00:16:31.268 --> 00:16:45.219]  They are shifting the universities and the job templates away from an industrial free market economy into a command and control neo-fascist economy where all the big new
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:17:05.752]  majors in the colleges or homeland security or criminal justice or this new draconian super soviet style psychology that they can't get you into the welfare system, they can't get you into the criminal justice system, they'll economically wreck you or they'll get you into the psychiatric military industrial big pharma complex
[00:17:08.146 --> 00:17:20.051]  The thumb scanners are going in at the grocery stores, the home depots, the self-checkout lanes, the cameras, the face scanners, the satellite trackers, the surveillance blimps, the NSA tracking the American people.
[00:17:21.072 --> 00:17:25.114]  It's all racing ahead as they build this control system around us.
[00:17:25.214 --> 00:17:29.956]  And they say in this control system, they are then going to start a one-child policy worldwide.
[00:17:30.655 --> 00:17:37.696]  They're going to make you send your children to live at government schools if you're underprivileged, which will be 80% of the public very soon.
[00:17:38.436 --> 00:17:45.538]  Quote, because you can't raise your own family, you don't have the money, the economy will break down, you'll go and put them into the government schools and get to see them on the weekends.
[00:17:45.918 --> 00:17:48.658]  And that's just phase one, this is all public, this is the plan.
[00:17:49.939 --> 00:17:52.379]  And it's all unfolding, and you don't think they'll do it?
[00:17:52.499 --> 00:17:53.019]  They're doing it.
[00:17:53.299 --> 00:17:57.340]  It's happening right now, they've got all their excuses to implement this and carry this out.
[00:18:00.536 --> 00:18:21.719]  And the elite are predatory to the max, and they are dumbing us down, and subjugating us, and basically freezing our technological development, or radically slowing it, on the general plane of technological existence that we all live on, while these technological spires
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:41.916]  Or pyramidal structures of advanced technologies have been built throughout the general system, where only the elites have access to the life extensions, the supercomputing systems, the genetic engineering, which we then are not even made aware of, which they keep secret under the national security shroud, or iron curtain.
[00:18:42.978 --> 00:18:50.803]  And as they get more power and make more incredible breakthroughs that we can hardly imagine, they become more and more power-mad and drunk and arrogant.
[00:18:51.163 --> 00:18:59.048]  And that arrogance against us, in this frozen technological state, is even harder for the general public to comprehend.
[00:18:59.288 --> 00:19:04.731]  Meanwhile, our language is being damaged, the words are being changed, vocabularies are shrinking.
[00:19:05.591 --> 00:19:14.878]  At an accelerated pace, the public has been dumbed down massively, and that is only intensifying and growing in our stupidity at geometric rates.
[00:19:15.218 --> 00:19:16.900]  Common sense is being driven out of us.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.864]  The family instinct to defend ourselves, to have family units, is being systematically liquidated.
[00:19:23.064 --> 00:19:29.749]  We're being turned into a bunch of gibbering, corrupt, decadent weasels that mimic our globalist masters.
[00:19:31.357 --> 00:19:50.245]  And so there you have this subspecies of our own kind, literally feeding and ruling over us, and, uh, dumbing us down, and they really have no use for us as they go to, uh, automated robotic systems where small elites will be able to control entire populations without even having physical, uh, homo sapien enforcers.
[00:19:52.105 --> 00:19:57.728]  And so you will have the technocracy controlled by an ultra-tiny elite on complete power trips inbred.
[00:19:58.648 --> 00:20:00.009]  Completely criminally insane.
[00:20:01.588 --> 00:20:05.191]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:20:05.231 --> 00:20:06.792]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:20:06.992 --> 00:20:09.274]  I've never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[00:20:09.734 --> 00:20:13.557]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[00:20:13.977 --> 00:20:14.678]  It truly works.
[00:20:14.998 --> 00:20:16.439]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:20:16.639 --> 00:20:22.583]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:20:22.683 --> 00:20:28.728]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:20:29.148 --> 00:20:33.171]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[00:20:33.531 --> 00:20:34.592]  It's healthy for you too.
[00:20:34.972 --> 00:20:42.478]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair and nails.
[00:20:42.898 --> 00:20:45.119]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[00:20:45.179 --> 00:20:46.240]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:46.320]  1-800-622-8446
[00:20:51.724 --> 00:20:54.947]  And listen, get $25 off a 3 month supply of Collagenate.
[00:20:55.247 --> 00:20:55.968]  So call now.
[00:20:55.988 --> 00:20:56.228]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:20:56.268 --> 00:20:56.488]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:21:02.014 --> 00:21:12.742]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:12.923 --> 00:21:20.508]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:20.769 --> 00:21:23.891]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:21:24.151 --> 00:21:29.893]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:21:30.193 --> 00:21:36.355]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:21:36.695 --> 00:21:40.596]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:21:40.636 --> 00:21:42.517]  The water level is always visible.
[00:21:42.717 --> 00:21:48.661]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:21:48.901 --> 00:21:52.844]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:52.864 --> 00:21:53.424]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:01.810 --> 00:22:08.013]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:08.474 --> 00:22:16.258]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:16.598 --> 00:22:24.442]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:24.762 --> 00:22:29.523]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:29.843 --> 00:22:34.544]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:35.064 --> 00:22:38.925]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:39.425 --> 00:22:40.425]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:40.505 --> 00:22:44.586]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:45.006 --> 00:22:49.407]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:49.907 --> 00:22:52.428]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:52.908 --> 00:22:55.490]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:56.811 --> 00:22:58.573]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.975 --> 00:23:04.018]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:23:04.518 --> 00:23:06.920]  Not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:14.206]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:14.406 --> 00:23:17.689]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:23:17.929 --> 00:23:19.911]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:20.291 --> 00:23:28.140]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:29.661]  Either way, why chance it?
[00:23:29.761 --> 00:23:39.632]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to see Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[00:23:44.373 --> 00:23:49.074]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[00:23:49.214 --> 00:23:50.895]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll free, 877-835-5555.
[00:23:51.015 --> 00:23:51.215]  That's 877-835-5555.
[00:23:51.235 --> 00:23:52.335]  Or visit seamineral.com.
[00:24:09.039 --> 00:24:12.541]  It is a double-edged sword, but it's being used to enslave us.
[00:24:14.843 --> 00:24:26.229]  Under the guise of national security, they have built advanced technologies and control systems and are now using them upon us and you can publicly see them building the slave grid, the prison all around us.
[00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.211]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment, 1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:36.261 --> 00:24:40.123]  Understand folks, they used the remote control systems.
[00:24:41.044 --> 00:24:50.529]  They used that to have drills on 9-11 to confuse the individuals inside the military complex that were not part of the New World Order attack.
[00:24:51.309 --> 00:24:56.612]  They then used that same system to pilot some of the aircraft into the towers in the Pentagon.
[00:24:59.034 --> 00:25:25.844]  And this is how you small elites can carry out these giant theatrical events to scare the rest of us into submission to then physically get behind this transformation into this electronic slave grid and then using our populations to people and control this new military push out to dominate what the Pentagon calls the gap for all these third world countries
[00:25:27.668 --> 00:25:29.429]  That have not yet been totally enslaved.
[00:25:32.110 --> 00:25:34.311]  And again, I go back to the implantable microchips.
[00:25:35.651 --> 00:25:40.173]  I would have guest on eight years ago who helped design the microchips in the Pentagon.
[00:25:41.733 --> 00:25:46.415]  And even then they already had experimental programs with some special forces with the chips.
[00:25:47.616 --> 00:25:53.498]  And my cousin told me over a year ago that they've been told the next two years they were all going to get chips and he's been in the army for 18 years.
[00:25:56.132 --> 00:25:59.653]  He's even over domestic police state activities, my friends.
[00:26:00.813 --> 00:26:08.036]  And then I saw an AP article that just mentioned, oh yes, the Pentagon is now admitting that some of their special forces do indeed have these chips.
[00:26:08.696 --> 00:26:15.038]  And then we hear, oh, it's going to be for the prisoners, and oh, it's going to be for the children, and oh, it's going to be for the club goers, and oh, it's going to be, you know, to get the big discounts.
[00:26:16.358 --> 00:26:17.879]  And then pretty soon you've got to have it.
[00:26:18.439 --> 00:26:18.779]  Period.
[00:26:19.454 --> 00:26:22.456]  That's like the self-checkout lanes, a great microcosm example.
[00:26:22.816 --> 00:26:25.978]  Here in Austin, Texas, three years ago, they started putting in self-checkout lanes.
[00:26:26.418 --> 00:26:30.601]  You'd have twelve normal lanes, and then they'd take three out and make them self-checkout.
[00:26:30.641 --> 00:26:32.422]  Then they'd make five of them self-checkout.
[00:26:32.462 --> 00:26:33.663]  Then ten of them self-checkout.
[00:26:33.723 --> 00:26:38.526]  And now, you go to Home Depot here in Austin, Texas, and some of the locations, one by my house,
[00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:45.121]  And you'll go in there and there'll be ten checkout lanes that are self-checkout and one lane that is service.
[00:26:45.641 --> 00:26:47.962]  And a lot of the time there's nobody there with a human there.
[00:26:48.442 --> 00:26:50.923]  So you're forced to go ahead and use a self-checkout.
[00:26:51.363 --> 00:26:52.524]  You go, how is this tyranny?
[00:26:52.584 --> 00:26:54.665]  Well, then they say there's not security.
[00:26:54.725 --> 00:26:58.367]  So you've got a thumb scan or face scan for it to activate or swipe your card.
[00:26:58.627 --> 00:26:59.527]  That's already beginning.
[00:27:00.468 --> 00:27:02.008]  This is the industry documents.
[00:27:02.448 --> 00:27:03.529]  It's how I knew they'd do this.
[00:27:04.238 --> 00:27:05.759]  And then they phase out checkers.
[00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:07.500]  And you go, well, that just lowers prices.
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:07.980]  Well, no.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.122]  When you look at real economic theory, then you don't have people there to have jobs or to buy the goods.
[00:27:12.683 --> 00:27:15.084]  We can construct the economy along whatever lines we want.
[00:27:15.464 --> 00:27:21.347]  We want it to be all automated and where there's no service and where that gives government centralized control and we don't have jobs.
[00:27:21.627 --> 00:27:22.548]  What's the point of that?
[00:27:23.328 --> 00:27:28.031]  Well, we'll have jobs surveilling each other or being in prison or being part of the psychiatric system.
[00:27:31.434 --> 00:27:33.425]  I mean it's just like he used to, you know.
[00:27:34.741 --> 00:27:46.345]  It was just a few cents more, and they checked your fluids, and checked your oil, and you had somebody pump the gas for you, and you had service, and they cleaned your windows, and then, oh, they started putting in the self-serve, and then, oh, we're just getting rid of the service.
[00:27:46.925 --> 00:28:01.450]  See, or they put in little trash cans and said thank you on them, and used peer pressure to make you throw your garbage away at McDonald's, and then all the other fast food restaurants adopted it, and then pretty soon they could get rid of more employees, and you didn't have any service, but, and they didn't pass on any savings to you, but you didn't care.
[00:28:05.583 --> 00:28:06.484]  Start to figure this out.
[00:28:07.464 --> 00:28:10.546]  And again, those are just on-the-ground functions of this.
[00:28:12.447 --> 00:28:25.335]  You look at the military, and they run their ads for the Air Force, which shows the kid with the toy airplane and the remote-controlled airplane, and then it shows you in a remote cockpit controlling a bunch of different drones and cruise missiles, and see it all shift to that.
[00:28:25.375 --> 00:28:32.039]  And then now it's shifting to automated computer programs that are just pre-programmed, and then one person can launch an attack with thousands of aircraft.
[00:28:35.157 --> 00:28:37.499]  Then if they like, they can claim hackers got in and did it.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:37.840]  Oh!
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:43.846]  Or they can send in mechanized robotic tanks, which they now are testing publicly and showing to go in and control cities.
[00:28:44.066 --> 00:28:47.629]  And then it won't matter if the police won't fire on their citizens or confiscate guns.
[00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:51.353]  They can just send in their remote control systems to do it.
[00:28:53.422 --> 00:28:55.045]  And this is what the Pentagon says!
[00:28:55.706 --> 00:28:59.292]  And we just sit here and watch this unfold and watch this happen.
[00:28:59.713 --> 00:29:04.000]  Giving this tiny technocracy of only a few thousand globalists total control.
[00:29:04.241 --> 00:29:05.403]  That's why they're so arrogant!
[00:29:06.167 --> 00:29:08.329]  And they're doing it all through electronic sleight-of-hand.
[00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:10.372]  Look at the voting with these electronic voting machines.
[00:29:10.612 --> 00:29:12.474]  Their own engineers quit and tell you it's a fraud.
[00:29:12.514 --> 00:29:14.176]  They're caught stealing elections coast-to-coast.
[00:29:14.496 --> 00:29:16.658]  And they laugh at you and say, don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[00:29:16.958 --> 00:29:17.739]  Just trust us.
[00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:19.001]  You don't get any paper trail.
[00:29:19.501 --> 00:29:24.947]  But suddenly, coast-to-coast, in areas where these have gone in, they say, we don't care if 90 plus percent of you are against the policy.
[00:29:25.147 --> 00:29:25.848]  We're going to do it.
[00:29:25.908 --> 00:29:26.548]  Vote us out.
[00:29:26.749 --> 00:29:28.751]  And then you can't vote them out, and they laugh at you.
[00:29:32.597 --> 00:29:39.561]  Then they put in these electronic voting machines nationwide, have a constitutional convention, and go, you voted to get rid of your Bill of Rights.
[00:29:39.821 --> 00:29:42.283]  You voted to make Arnold Schwarzenegger your president.
[00:29:42.643 --> 00:29:45.164]  You voted to join the world government.
[00:29:46.125 --> 00:29:47.265]  You voted for all this.
[00:29:47.345 --> 00:29:48.246]  It's democracy.
[00:29:48.266 --> 00:29:49.467]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.788 --> 00:29:52.709]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.169 --> 00:29:54.810]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:58.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.458 --> 00:30:03.939]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:30:04.139 --> 00:30:11.481]  Jerry Guadetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:30:11.802 --> 00:30:16.203]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:30:16.463 --> 00:30:26.307]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.

[00:32:09.614 --> 00:32:13.855]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:14.075 --> 00:32:21.117]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.497 --> 00:32:27.599]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:28.959]  There are no side effects.

[00:33:24.467 --> 00:33:25.368]  It is Thursday.
[00:33:25.388 --> 00:33:31.052]  All right, let me go over some of the news, then we'll go to Don and Ken and Robert and Sharice and many others.
[00:33:31.432 --> 00:33:34.755]  Call the free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:35.336 --> 00:33:37.037]  This is from InfoWars.com.
[00:33:37.077 --> 00:33:42.061]  Exclusive microchip implantation of club-going trendies expands to more nations.
[00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:51.048]  In April of 2004, InfoWars.com broke in the United States the story about the Baja Beach Club's microchip implantation of its VIP members.
[00:33:52.122 --> 00:33:59.226]  Then in September, a listener wrote that Baja Beach Club had expansion plans and was going to start new clubs in Rotterdam and Cologne.
[00:33:59.806 --> 00:34:02.087]  Now we have this report in from a listener in the Netherlands.
[00:34:02.367 --> 00:34:08.390]  Not only has Baja Beach Club opened up in Rotterdam, but Cool Club goers are already lining up to be implanted.
[00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:14.453]  In April, after interviewing Baja Beach Club director Conrad Chase, Alex wrote,
[00:34:15.211 --> 00:34:17.132]  My wife wrote this at the start of the article.
[00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:20.794]  I interviewed Conrad Chase for 30 minutes on my syndicated radio broadcast.
[00:34:21.114 --> 00:34:28.778]  He told me that the CEO of Verichip, Mr. Bolton, had told him that there was a plan to use the Verichip as a global implantable identity system.
[00:34:29.939 --> 00:34:34.941]  I asked him of whether in the future you would have to have a chip to get into the club, period, and he said yes.
[00:34:35.622 --> 00:34:43.606]  I said laughingly that you're not going to be a VIP in the world if you don't have the chip, to which he responded that was a great slogan that he would start using.
[00:34:44.734 --> 00:34:45.755]  Which they are now using.
[00:34:46.136 --> 00:34:47.056]  I need to shut my mouth.
[00:34:47.437 --> 00:34:52.441]  He went on to say that all gun owners should have to have a microchip implanted in their hand to be able to own a gun.
[00:34:52.781 --> 00:34:58.346]  He also said that the Verishop company had told him that the Italian government was preparing to implant all their government workers.
[00:34:58.807 --> 00:35:02.510]  He said that this is a great system that he believes will replace credit cards.
[00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:04.491]  Uh, for buying and selling.
[00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:06.911]  He went on to say that the chip will prevail.
[00:35:06.951 --> 00:35:07.532]  That was a quote.
[00:35:07.912 --> 00:35:21.376]  I asked him whether he was getting all of these ideas, and he said that he had learned all of this from discussions with Verichip, and that he was aware that the plant making the chips was in Beijing, China, partially owned by the Communist military.
[00:35:21.956 --> 00:35:23.838]  It doesn't get any more bone-chilling than this.
[00:35:23.918 --> 00:35:26.780]  They're going to sell microchips as the ultimate in trendiness.
[00:35:27.241 --> 00:35:38.590]  At the end of the clip from, and then we shift to the new article, at the end of the clip from Dutch television, you'll notice that there is a discussion about a gun and a chip and criminals having to have chips.
[00:35:39.311 --> 00:35:43.975]  Read the listener email below for the translation of the video clip and related news.
[00:35:44.275 --> 00:35:45.757]  Our listener from
[00:35:47.915 --> 00:35:50.636]  The Netherlands actually translated all of this.
[00:35:50.656 --> 00:36:00.443]  He has the original article in Dutch and then he shifts it over from the Netherlands to television and writes it all out for us in English.
[00:36:01.063 --> 00:36:05.126]  Luckily, my wife lived in Europe most of her life.
[00:36:05.386 --> 00:36:09.409]  Her dad worked in the agriculture department so she can read all of this.
[00:36:10.692 --> 00:36:19.178]  This Dutch, and she read it and said it was very accurate, so we appreciate our listener doing that over there in the Netherlands.
[00:36:19.218 --> 00:36:19.959]  Thank you very much.
[00:36:20.439 --> 00:36:22.521]  So it's all translated, and we have the video there.
[00:36:23.442 --> 00:36:38.053]  But the point is, is that the guy comes on, he goes, oh yeah, I talked to the CEO, you know, I'm the big European distributor now, and he said, you're going to have to have it globally as a new idea, you'll have to have it to own a gun, you'll have criminals, you'll have everybody's going to have the chip, the chip will prevail, was an exact quote.
[00:36:38.953 --> 00:36:39.734]  And then all of a sudden,
[00:36:41.718 --> 00:36:43.779]  He had said Italy was preparing to do this.
[00:36:43.819 --> 00:36:46.820]  Later we saw mainstream news articles about it months ago, but they haven't done it yet.
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:47.881]  Mexico did!
[00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:59.626]  Just a few months ago, after we did this report, Mexico said, well, three hundred and twenty-something people that work at this high-security Justice Department in Mexico City will have to have it to work in the building.
[00:36:59.646 --> 00:37:01.807]  The doors automatically open and it checks you.
[00:37:01.987 --> 00:37:03.748]  No reason to do that, but they just do it.
[00:37:04.168 --> 00:37:06.489]  Could have thumb scans or face scans, but they already had that.
[00:37:06.869 --> 00:37:08.010]  Now you have to do this too.
[00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:11.051]  And now on top of it,
[00:37:11.864 --> 00:37:14.665]  They made another 300 do it.
[00:37:14.725 --> 00:37:18.326]  Now they're, last time I heard, going to make the police start doing it, the federales.
[00:37:19.606 --> 00:37:20.426]  Want a job with us?
[00:37:20.466 --> 00:37:21.246]  Got to take the chip.
[00:37:24.567 --> 00:37:28.748]  And then there was articles out of Florida where they're talking about making the police there take a chip.
[00:37:29.788 --> 00:37:32.309]  I mean, just Twilight Zone type stuff.
[00:37:32.329 --> 00:37:38.210]  We're just gone from warning you years ago about this to, oh, the chip will keep you safe, to, oh, you might have to take it.
[00:37:39.835 --> 00:37:43.757]  Very, very, very serious situation.
[00:37:43.777 --> 00:37:46.018]  But you need to go watch the video.
[00:37:46.058 --> 00:37:49.140]  We play the audio, but 98% of us wouldn't be able to understand it.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:57.204]  But you can go watch the video and then read the transcript of the video on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:37:57.984 --> 00:37:58.564]  Here's another one.
[00:37:58.584 --> 00:37:59.365]  We're on that daily.
[00:37:59.385 --> 00:38:00.966]  And of course, we posted this days ago.
[00:38:02.225 --> 00:38:08.253]  These new announcements by industry and the federal government about how they're going to make everyone have this.
[00:38:08.874 --> 00:38:18.728]  And this has also been introduced into the new 9-11 bill that has the Patriot Act II in it, that has the National ID Card in it, that has the Total Information Awareness Network in it.
[00:38:19.241 --> 00:38:25.445]  Lawmakers consider smart driver's license computer chip signals allow data to be read from a distance.
[00:38:25.485 --> 00:38:37.072]  A controversial technology already planned for tracking consumer products could be used to create smart driver's license that emits signals readable from a distance according to federal and state government officials contemplating ways to fight identity fraud.
[00:38:37.533 --> 00:38:40.194]  Which, again, they set up a system where you're allowed to do that.
[00:38:40.235 --> 00:38:40.915]  That could be stopped.
[00:38:41.741 --> 00:38:42.141]  Directly.
[00:38:42.522 --> 00:38:52.729]  Radio Frequency Identification or RFID could help Fort Terrorists use falsified documents to get around as Virginia lawmakers who will hear testimony on the technology uses reports wired.
[00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:54.470]  Here's the problem.
[00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:55.391]  The U.S.
[00:38:55.491 --> 00:39:05.778]  Government ordered Mr. Springman and others in the Saudi Arabian and other embassies to allow them in and told them they're part of a secret training program.
[00:39:05.978 --> 00:39:07.599]  We're training terrorists, they told them.
[00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:15.913]  We've done those interviews, it's been on the news, and they would let them out of the country to go to Al Qaeda summits in Malaysia and make sure they got back into the country.
[00:39:15.933 --> 00:39:17.853]  And those that helped do this got bonuses.
[00:39:17.894 --> 00:39:20.275]  Those that fought against it were fired or reprimanded.
[00:39:21.215 --> 00:39:26.898]  So again, and the border's wide open and the government accepts all the matricula cards, admittedly knowing they're fake and accepts anything else.
[00:39:27.438 --> 00:39:28.638]  So this is about the citizenry.
[00:39:29.219 --> 00:39:34.001]  As World Daily reported, a Johnson & Johnson executive recently told industry leaders that in the future
[00:39:34.775 --> 00:39:39.477]  And this continues, the RFID chips will be on everything from diapers to surgical instruments.
[00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:44.920]  On the driver's license, the computer chips would emit a radio signal bearing the holder's unique personal information.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:50.062]  Virginia is considering adding biometric data such as fingerprints to retinal scans of the RFID tags.
[00:39:50.643 --> 00:39:56.125]  And then it goes on, this has been introduced in two of the national ID card bills that are now before Congress.
[00:39:58.675 --> 00:39:59.977]  This is the reality, folks.
[00:39:59.997 --> 00:40:07.630]  Remember three years ago, the IBM commercial, where the guy looks like a thug, you know, he's really stylish, got the goatee, wearing the black leather jacket.
[00:40:08.011 --> 00:40:12.218]  He goes into the grocery store and starts cramming ham and lettuce and
[00:40:12.842 --> 00:40:15.043]  Stuff in his jacket, you go, oh, he's going to get busted.
[00:40:15.303 --> 00:40:17.363]  You see the security guard looking at him, following him.
[00:40:17.783 --> 00:40:23.665]  And then he walks out and gets scanned by these blue laser lights, which is figurative, so you understand the scanning.
[00:40:23.925 --> 00:40:25.005]  You really don't see anything.
[00:40:25.345 --> 00:40:30.206]  And he just walks out, and the cop runs over, and the security guard goes, sir, sir, sir!
[00:40:30.226 --> 00:40:31.247]  And you go, oh, he's going to get it.
[00:40:31.707 --> 00:40:33.067]  And the guy on the train goes, what?
[00:40:33.087 --> 00:40:35.508]  He goes, you forgot your receipt!
[00:40:36.568 --> 00:40:40.909]  And then it shows, oh, you've got the IBM tracker chip in your license, and you're able
[00:40:41.505 --> 00:40:47.447]  You know, it's like Lockheed Martin six years ago, sort of running those ads where it shows a morning launch of the Space Shuttle.
[00:40:48.287 --> 00:40:56.029]  You have this feeling of pride, and it's a sunrise, and it's lifting off, and birds are lifting off, you know, from the water, scared by it.
[00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:58.810]  And the man looks up at pride.
[00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:00.770]  We all have pride.
[00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:02.351]  And he points with his finger.
[00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:06.672]  And then the camera rotates in, zooms into his finger, and he's biometrically scanned.
[00:41:07.152 --> 00:41:10.673]  Why would Lockheed Martin run that ad on every channel for three or four years?
[00:41:11.525 --> 00:41:12.746]  I thought they'd stop doing it.
[00:41:12.766 --> 00:41:14.006]  I rarely watch TV.
[00:41:14.046 --> 00:41:16.587]  I was watching TV a week ago and saw it again on CNN.
[00:41:17.307 --> 00:41:19.808]  Why do they just do these advertisements about biometrics?
[00:41:19.828 --> 00:41:20.789]  Because they're getting you trained.
[00:41:20.809 --> 00:41:21.669]  They're getting you used to it.
[00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:24.330]  And now they're doing it.
[00:41:24.370 --> 00:41:26.171]  I mean, this is a good, important example.
[00:41:26.791 --> 00:41:34.154]  In areas outside Dallas and Arlington, four years ago, we have these articles posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:41:34.414 --> 00:41:36.295]  One of the first postings we ever did on our Yahoo group.
[00:41:36.335 --> 00:41:38.196]  You can go back to those original postings where we saved it.
[00:41:39.003 --> 00:41:48.230]  And the Dallas Morning News reported, the police just went around all the businesses and said, you have to put inkless fingerprint readers in, thumb scanners, or we're not going to prosecute fraud cases for you.
[00:41:48.570 --> 00:41:52.973]  Most people refused, but now some of the tanning salons and grocery stores have put them in.
[00:41:53.193 --> 00:41:59.758]  Then the county that Denver resides in, I got another article, Rocky Mountain News, about a month later, where police, again, concerted efforts, said you've got to do this.
[00:42:00.038 --> 00:42:03.921]  Most refused, but again, they're trying to force you to do something that isn't even the law.
[00:42:05.618 --> 00:42:12.282]  And now this will be part of the new National ID Card Identification System, but if you don't like that, it'll just be in your license and scan you.
[00:42:13.803 --> 00:42:15.604]  And then one more article and we'll go to your calls.
[00:42:17.545 --> 00:42:22.247]  This is a really scary one, as we keep warning you, but now it's going into place right now.
[00:42:22.547 --> 00:42:25.129]  Within a year in Austin, Texas, we'll all have to have this.
[00:42:26.219 --> 00:42:26.759]  It's public.
[00:42:26.819 --> 00:42:27.820]  It's going to be statewide.
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.841]  Every state road and then the major federal highways.
[00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:33.582]  Every major road in Texas.
[00:42:33.942 --> 00:42:34.502]  6,000 miles of it.
[00:42:34.542 --> 00:42:36.103]  The whole nation has 7,000 miles.
[00:42:36.163 --> 00:42:36.663]  It's official.
[00:42:37.163 --> 00:42:38.684]  Feds plan to track every car.
[00:42:38.744 --> 00:42:42.285]  Obscure agency working on technology that monitors all vehicles.
[00:42:42.665 --> 00:42:51.208]  Little known, federal agency is planning a new monitoring program by which the government would track every car on the road by using onboard transceivers.
[00:42:51.329 --> 00:42:55.110]  The agency, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Joint Program Office,
[00:42:55.934 --> 00:43:03.936]  ...is part of the Department of Transportation, according to an extensive report in the Charlotte, North Carolina, Creative Loafing, and that's a major weekly paper.
[00:43:04.456 --> 00:43:08.076]  The agency doesn't respond to public inquiries about its activity.
[00:43:08.096 --> 00:43:15.058]  According to the report, cutting-edge tracking technology will be used by government transportation management centers to monitor every aspect of transportation.
[00:43:15.418 --> 00:43:20.459]  Out of the plan, not only will movement be monitored, but it will also be archived in a massive database for future use.
[00:43:20.999 --> 00:43:27.223]  The paper reports that a group of car manufacturers, technology companies, and government interests have worked towards implementing the project for 13 years.
[00:43:28.364 --> 00:43:41.672]  And again, it was in another industry publication yesterday that we posted as a headline where they say there will be nationwide toll roads and the transceiver will be digitally coded for each new zone and will tax you off the account that you have to pre-charge.
[00:43:41.992 --> 00:43:47.135]  And if you drive on the road anywhere, you'll be pulled over if you do not have the transceiver because you're not paying your fair share.
[00:43:49.003 --> 00:43:55.646]  And it says, states the Creative Loafing Report, the only way for people to evade the National Gravitation Tracking System they're creating will be to travel on foot.
[00:43:55.966 --> 00:43:59.808]  Drive your car, and your every movement could be recorded and archived.
[00:43:59.828 --> 00:44:11.193]  The federal government will know the exact routine and route you drove to work, how many times you braked along the way, the precise moment you arrived, and then every other Tuesday you opt to ride the bus.
[00:44:12.421 --> 00:44:23.186]  And, uh, by the way, that new National ID Card driver's license will have a powerful medium-sized transmitter in it that can be read from upwards of 200 feet, I would add.
[00:44:24.307 --> 00:44:28.369]  And it says, though, no, you're due for a transmission repair that you've neglected to fix.
[00:44:28.389 --> 00:44:33.771]  Your ever-widening crack resulted from a pebble dinging your windshield.
[00:44:33.811 --> 00:44:40.915]  The agency website says its purpose is to use advanced technology to impose the efficiency and safety of our nation's surface transportation system.
[00:44:41.861 --> 00:44:53.209]  And again, it goes on to say that the report estimates that $4 billion in federal tax dollars have already been spent to lay the foundation for the system which will use GPS technology and other methods to monitor Americans' movements.
[00:44:53.769 --> 00:45:01.174]  Then again, I have the article here, the article from yesterday from an industry publication saying you'll be taxed everywhere.
[00:45:01.909 --> 00:45:12.138]  And it goes on to say that by 2010, this will be nationwide, and that the automakers are already automatically putting this into the cars, including Toyota, who just announced that last year.
[00:45:13.339 --> 00:45:17.923]  So they put it into your car first, put the satellite tracker... forget the transceivers, folks.
[00:45:17.964 --> 00:45:25.130]  They're going to... they've already got the plugs for 8-9 years already in the ignitions, ready to be plugged in.
[00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:27.152]  You'll pay for that when you get your tax.
[00:45:27.927 --> 00:45:31.289]  And then you'll only have the transponder under special license.
[00:45:31.329 --> 00:45:35.811]  If you have a vintage car that you're specially licensed to have, then that will be tracked by transceiver.
[00:45:36.111 --> 00:45:37.772]  It will begin, though, with transceiver.
[00:45:39.913 --> 00:45:43.734]  Oregon, though, is moving ahead with automatic satellite tracking toll systems immediately.
[00:45:44.555 --> 00:45:49.057]  Again, these are the data reports we're giving you of the unfolding death grip on freedom.
[00:45:49.817 --> 00:45:51.358]  Let's go to Don in
[00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:55.671]  Yeah, thank you Alex.
[00:45:55.731 --> 00:46:01.215]  I called you yesterday and I actually made a mistake when I mentioned that you're going to be on TV Friday evening.
[00:46:01.716 --> 00:46:05.299]  It's not going to be on ESPN2, it's going to be on CMT.
[00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:06.740]  Now they have a lot of audience.
[00:46:07.543 --> 00:46:13.608]  Yeah, that's what I thought, because I was interviewed by CMT, not ESPN.
[00:46:13.648 --> 00:46:16.610]  Well, what it was, I was watching two things at one time.
[00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.111]  Well, that's okay.
[00:46:18.131 --> 00:46:19.472]  What did the ad show?
[00:46:20.193 --> 00:46:34.845]  Well, it showed you talking there for a few minutes, and they were commenting about basically the proper role of what militia is supposed to be, and then a little bit about what is believed and perceived by the American public.
[00:46:35.931 --> 00:46:37.612]  Evidently, you're going to try to set them straight.
[00:46:37.672 --> 00:46:38.293]  I hope you do.
[00:46:38.313 --> 00:46:40.454]  I understand what the purpose of the militia is.
[00:46:42.296 --> 00:46:44.697]  So, it was an ad that was a couple minutes long?
[00:46:44.857 --> 00:46:49.841]  Oh yeah, I would say probably 30 to 45 seconds long.
[00:46:50.181 --> 00:46:50.902]  Oh, okay.
[00:46:50.922 --> 00:46:54.765]  You know, they do them pretty quick.
[00:46:55.005 --> 00:46:56.606]  You were the first one they shown.
[00:46:58.744 --> 00:47:01.405]  Well, I hope somebody will tape that for me.
[00:47:01.425 --> 00:47:03.666]  I don't really watch TV when I'm on it.
[00:47:04.166 --> 00:47:07.767]  Well, I'm going to record it tomorrow night when it comes on anyway.
[00:47:08.287 --> 00:47:08.608]  Yeah.
[00:47:09.308 --> 00:47:14.650]  I think while you're on the air live, you ought to put some plugs in there because if it's confirmed, it'll be 8 p.m.
[00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.470]  on CMT, Friday evening.
[00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:17.991]  Is that central or eastern?
[00:47:18.191 --> 00:47:19.451]  That'll be eastern time.
[00:47:19.471 --> 00:47:21.772]  So it'll be 7 central.
[00:47:22.432 --> 00:47:22.912]  All right.
[00:47:22.992 --> 00:47:23.893]  Well, CMT.
[00:47:25.303 --> 00:47:31.144]  I got interviewed by a couple of British, Japanese, CMT, a couple of others.
[00:47:31.184 --> 00:47:32.945]  I've been on a bunch of different TV shows lately.
[00:47:33.305 --> 00:47:35.425]  Some of them are hit pieces.
[00:47:35.945 --> 00:47:37.546]  You mentioned something about mind control.
[00:47:37.566 --> 00:47:39.926]  You talked about some of these movies from back in the 60s.
[00:47:39.946 --> 00:47:47.188]  When I was in high school and college back there in Houston growing up, there was a movie that came out called The Time Machine.
[00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.348]  In one segment of the movie,
[00:47:50.553 --> 00:47:52.635]  Uh, where he had progressed forward in time.
[00:47:52.735 --> 00:47:54.977]  And you mentioned something about the Morlocks a while ago.
[00:47:55.617 --> 00:48:04.684]  If the people, the thing back in my age group in their 50s, they did this high pitch down and the people just turned and just walked towards them.
[00:48:05.188 --> 00:48:09.990]  And with what you're talking about, what they're implanting into the brains, what they're going to, this is where we're headed.
[00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.890]  I mean, we have been... Well, I mentioned H.G.
[00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:34.618]  Wells, who did write The Time Machine with the Morlocks, and again, he wrote a book, non-fiction, called The New World Order, where he said, we will have an advanced elite of humanity, we will dominate and enslave, and then he also then wrote fiction books to laugh at the general public, where that's a metaphor, and then you read the book, they were offshoots of us genetically, and so it's kind of a sick joke on us.
[00:48:34.938 --> 00:48:35.478]  Yes it is.
[00:48:36.079 --> 00:48:38.020]  And two quick things here.
[00:48:38.721 --> 00:48:41.202]  Yesterday you were talking about the draft.
[00:48:41.903 --> 00:48:45.525]  Well on Fox News yesterday, and this is something I was going to try to get into.
[00:48:45.545 --> 00:48:46.946]  They said they voted down the draft.
[00:48:47.487 --> 00:49:00.656]  No, what they said is what the colleges and on the internet all across the colleges across the country and in the conversation within the colleges is that the draft is going to come to pass.
[00:49:02.368 --> 00:49:05.670]  But Fox News can't seem to find anything about this.
[00:49:06.110 --> 00:49:08.731]  Well, let me just go over that briefly and thanks for the call, sir.
[00:49:08.851 --> 00:49:10.211]  Thanks for the heads up on CMT.
[00:49:10.992 --> 00:49:14.713]  Look, I'm going to be on the road Friday night, folks.
[00:49:14.733 --> 00:49:16.674]  That's why I'm asking you to take the CMT for me.
[00:49:17.194 --> 00:49:19.855]  I probably would watch it if I was home, but I remembered I usually forget.
[00:49:20.235 --> 00:49:21.175]  I hate television now.
[00:49:21.555 --> 00:49:22.276]  I'm just on it.
[00:49:25.367 --> 00:49:26.668]  The draft boards were reinstated.
[00:49:26.688 --> 00:49:28.049]  They introduced 12 different bills.
[00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:29.931]  Rangel introduced one of the bills.
[00:49:30.211 --> 00:49:31.952]  They focused on that and said, oh, it's just the Democrats.
[00:49:32.012 --> 00:49:32.192]  No.
[00:49:32.232 --> 00:49:33.333]  Senator Hagel introduced.
[00:49:33.353 --> 00:49:34.234]  Some other bills were introduced.
[00:49:34.774 --> 00:49:35.855]  They've said they need a draft.
[00:49:35.875 --> 00:49:37.336]  The military's been told the draft's coming.
[00:49:37.356 --> 00:49:39.898]  They're already drafting people who've already served in the military.
[00:49:40.499 --> 00:49:42.881]  Folks who've been out for years are being recalled forcibly.
[00:49:43.461 --> 00:49:45.443]  Uh, who even have cancer and medical problems.
[00:49:45.463 --> 00:49:46.063]  This has been in the news.
[00:49:46.083 --> 00:49:51.007]  People who have, you know, cancer, who, you know, who got bald heads on chemotherapy are being called back.
[00:49:51.307 --> 00:49:52.588]  And that's been in the Associated Press.
[00:49:52.648 --> 00:49:54.050]  This is like a joke or something.
[00:49:54.090 --> 00:49:54.530]  It's sick.
[00:49:55.467 --> 00:50:07.409]  And so, because there's such political heat on the government, they went ahead and brought it up to vote, 402 to 2 days ago, and made the news yesterday, and they voted down the draft for now.
[00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.470]  Well, we've always said it comes after a terror attack next year.
[00:50:10.990 --> 00:50:15.291]  And my military sources, the people on the draft boards, have told me it comes next year after the election.
[00:50:15.771 --> 00:50:17.131]  Obviously, it doesn't come now.
[00:50:18.132 --> 00:50:23.053]  So that was just a political grandstanding by the Republicans and the Democrats two days ago.
[00:50:23.473 --> 00:50:24.673]  That's all that happened.
[00:50:25.512 --> 00:50:26.132]  That's all they're doing.
[00:50:26.152 --> 00:50:28.014]  I'm going to try to go to your calls a little bit quicker when we get back.
[00:50:28.534 --> 00:50:30.515]  Ken and Robert and many, many others.
[00:50:30.535 --> 00:50:31.155]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:31.215 --> 00:50:36.619]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:50:36.699 --> 00:50:38.300]  But here they are, openly.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.982]  They're going to be tracked and traced and taxed and everything you do, looked at.
[00:50:42.002 --> 00:50:43.823]  Nothing to do with terrorism.
[00:50:43.883 --> 00:50:45.484]  It's all the tax the daylights out of you.
[00:50:45.504 --> 00:50:46.945]  And it's all legislation right now.
[00:50:46.965 --> 00:50:48.786]  And the states are already implementing it.
[00:50:49.647 --> 00:50:52.468]  And the town where I live will be a giant prison.
[00:50:52.989 --> 00:50:54.189]  Checkpoints everywhere.
[00:50:54.229 --> 00:50:55.210]  Nothing but toll roads.
[00:50:55.925 --> 00:50:57.706]  It's right here where I live, folks.
[00:50:58.167 --> 00:50:59.908]  They don't care if 93% of us are against it.
[00:51:01.649 --> 00:51:03.170]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.350 --> 00:51:06.452]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.592 --> 00:51:10.494]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.534 --> 00:51:14.797]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.117 --> 00:51:18.900]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.821]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.421 --> 00:51:24.324]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.364 --> 00:51:29.088]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.228 --> 00:51:32.291]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.451 --> 00:51:35.333]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.814 --> 00:51:41.939]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.459 --> 00:51:46.243]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.644 --> 00:51:48.025]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.426 --> 00:51:49.467]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.527 --> 00:51:51.769]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.789 --> 00:51:53.011]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[00:52:00.879 --> 00:52:03.900]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.221 --> 00:52:09.143]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.403 --> 00:52:13.745]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.045 --> 00:52:22.969]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.169 --> 00:52:26.791]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.071 --> 00:52:32.138]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.

[00:54:57.816 --> 00:55:04.161]  This global New World Order takeover cannot stand if we simply educate people.
[00:55:04.401 --> 00:55:07.364]  And the New World Order has to reapply us lies daily.
[00:55:16.249 --> 00:55:18.932]  We just gotta prove they're lying once to somebody if they're open-minded.
[00:55:19.312 --> 00:55:22.916]  And they wake up and are off on their own waking other people up.
[00:55:23.337 --> 00:55:24.318]  That's our secret weapon.
[00:55:24.378 --> 00:55:25.139]  It's called the truth.

[00:56:01.117 --> 00:56:01.917]  Ken, you're on the air.
[00:56:01.977 --> 00:56:02.517]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:56:02.677 --> 00:56:03.358]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:56:03.378 --> 00:56:04.798]  This is Ken up in Paris, Texas.
[00:56:04.858 --> 00:56:05.739]  I have the day off today.
[00:56:05.759 --> 00:56:07.159]  I just wanted to kind of call in if I could.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.561]  Basically, I work for the largest privately owned department store chain in the U.S.
[00:56:11.601 --> 00:56:15.002]  of A. Just wanted to let you know we're going to start with the thumb scanning process.
[00:56:15.022 --> 00:56:18.944]  Basically, we're going to start clocking in and clocking out the replaced timecards beginning this Sunday.
[00:56:19.927 --> 00:56:23.850]  Almost everybody's going to that, and then they go in for the customers next.
[00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:31.535]  Basically, the company has about 225 stores and growing in 14 states, employs about 17,000 employees.
[00:56:31.715 --> 00:56:32.695]  You work for Dillard's?
[00:56:33.256 --> 00:56:33.636]  No, sir.
[00:56:33.816 --> 00:56:34.176]  No, sir.
[00:56:34.396 --> 00:56:34.837]  No, sir.
[00:56:34.857 --> 00:56:35.737]  They're out of Carolina.
[00:56:35.777 --> 00:56:36.418]  North Carolina.
[00:56:36.638 --> 00:56:37.278]  JCPenney?
[00:56:37.538 --> 00:56:37.959]  No, sir.
[00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:38.899]  Sears?
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:39.560]  Belk.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.441]  B-E-L-K, Belk.
[00:56:41.921 --> 00:56:42.261]  Okay.
[00:56:42.942 --> 00:56:46.244]  And basically did about $2.26 billion in fiscal year 2004 revenue.
[00:56:46.264 --> 00:56:47.485]  Just wanted to let you know.
[00:56:48.499 --> 00:56:57.384]  And again, they sell it like, ooh, stop time cheats and all this, but again, after they do that, they've already started the next phase, they make the customers do it.
[00:56:57.404 --> 00:57:00.946]  It's like they make the cops do it, they make the cops take the chips, and then they'll make us take them.
[00:57:01.907 --> 00:57:17.576]  Well, I just want to kind of let you know about that, and let you know also, basically in this publication they come out with monthly, they also are kind of bragging about the fact that the top 10 countries they get their merchandise from, they kind of went through the process, and of course the big spike in the graphic chart goes to China, and the rest go to Singapore, Taiwan,
[00:57:18.907 --> 00:57:20.468]  Let's see here, India, etc.
[00:57:20.488 --> 00:57:21.289]  The list goes on.
[00:57:21.409 --> 00:57:22.591]  Yeah, they're very proud of it.
[00:57:22.631 --> 00:57:26.715]  Bush is led by saying, our biggest export is jobs.
[00:57:26.735 --> 00:57:27.495]  See, that's a quote.
[00:57:27.555 --> 00:57:28.556]  This is a good thing.
[00:57:29.357 --> 00:57:35.423]  Well, I guess it's a conditioning process to kind of get us ready to make us think that this is something that's acceptable and good.
[00:57:35.483 --> 00:57:39.848]  I'm from the old school, kind of like you probably are as well yourself.
[00:57:40.528 --> 00:57:41.970]  These are jobs that Americans once had.
[00:57:42.543 --> 00:57:43.924]  That no longer we're going to see again.
[00:57:43.944 --> 00:57:47.186]  So it's kind of, you know, it's really sad to know that that's the case.
[00:57:47.226 --> 00:57:51.529]  I've heard politicians on TV and really bad on NPR a few months ago.
[00:57:51.570 --> 00:57:55.192]  They just said, this will teach Americans to stop living outside their means.
[00:57:55.512 --> 00:57:57.854]  We're about to have our standard of living lowered drastically.
[00:57:57.914 --> 00:57:59.295]  It's so good.
[00:58:00.416 --> 00:58:05.540]  Well, it's one of those things that I just, you know, just want to kind of let you know about what was going on.
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.862]  And it's a new experience for us in small town, USA, where we are.
[00:58:09.309 --> 00:58:13.032]  As far as going through that process to start the clock-in and clock-in and clock-out process.
[00:58:13.553 --> 00:58:20.759]  They're also trying to basically make us understand that once we put our thumbprint on that little scanner, that it's just going to take a fingerprint template.
[00:58:20.819 --> 00:58:22.921]  It won't be the same thing as a fingerprint.
[00:58:23.121 --> 00:58:23.501]  You know what?
[00:58:23.581 --> 00:58:23.922]  Stay there.
[00:58:23.942 --> 00:58:24.722]  I want to talk about this.
[00:58:25.063 --> 00:58:27.765]  Have you seen my film, Police State 3?
[00:58:28.346 --> 00:58:28.566]  No, sir.
[00:58:28.586 --> 00:58:29.407]  I haven't got that one yet.
[00:58:29.707 --> 00:58:34.391]  Well, in there we show HEB on the news, the big grocery store chain, saying
[00:58:35.283 --> 00:58:36.564]  We don't really take your thumbprint.
[00:58:36.584 --> 00:58:37.805]  We take zeros and ones.
[00:58:37.826 --> 00:58:39.067]  Well, what's a digital photo?
[00:58:39.127 --> 00:58:40.108]  It is your thumbprint.
[00:58:40.348 --> 00:58:41.529]  They go, oh, it's just a template.
[00:58:41.569 --> 00:58:42.430]  We don't store that.
[00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:44.291]  And it's not hooked in with the state police.
[00:58:44.672 --> 00:58:46.593]  Then we show the state police saying, oh, yes it is.
[00:58:47.634 --> 00:58:49.116]  So we'll talk about this more when we get back.
[00:58:49.176 --> 00:58:49.976]  It's the same lie.
[00:58:57.984 --> 00:58:58.644]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.305 --> 00:59:00.286]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:01.042 --> 00:59:02.123]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.804 --> 00:59:03.624]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.385 --> 00:59:05.265]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.285 --> 00:59:09.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:14.252]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.754 --> 00:59:27.022]  It is openly admitted now, mainstream news, every car will be tracked and taxed and traced, not just with satellite tracking, but with the new transponders that have been in for years in many toll road systems.
[00:59:27.042 --> 00:59:29.004]  You'll have to have this nationwide to drive anywhere.
[00:59:30.223 --> 00:59:32.203]  More articles about the new national ID cards.
[00:59:32.224 --> 00:59:35.844]  The driver's license will have a transponder tracker chip in it, RFID.
[00:59:37.245 --> 00:59:41.406]  And then Ken, who works at a big department store, called in.
[00:59:41.426 --> 00:59:43.906]  They're putting in thumb scanners there for them to clock in and out.
[00:59:43.926 --> 00:59:51.048]  And then this same lie that we have on video, where they tell you, oh, we don't really take your thumbprint, just a template of it with zeros and ones.
[00:59:51.108 --> 00:59:52.048]  It's just zeros and ones.
[00:59:52.228 --> 00:59:53.508]  Well, that's what a digital photo is.
[00:59:53.528 --> 00:59:54.508]  That's what your thumbprint is.
[00:59:54.908 --> 00:59:55.509]  It's a joke.
[00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:57.269]  It's a semantical manipulation.
[00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:11.307]  So this is the type of deception that they use and this does go into databases with the police and this will be used to buy and sell and it's already going in for people at tanning salons and grocery stores and nightclubs and banks and everywhere else.
[01:00:11.827 --> 01:00:16.333]  The ink pads that were put in 8-9 years ago at all the big banks to make you cash a check
[01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:19.795]  Are always paid for by a biometric consortium of these companies.
[01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:28.862]  You turn the ink pad over, it'll say the name of a biometric company that paid for it with an image of a red dot on the top to condition you to put your finger on the red dot, which is the laser scanner.
[01:00:28.902 --> 01:00:30.202]  It's all Pavlovian conditioning.
[01:00:31.103 --> 01:00:33.665]  Ken in Texas, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[01:00:34.136 --> 01:00:36.778]  Well, Alex, I just want to kind of let you know what's happening in that regard.
[01:00:37.118 --> 01:00:39.579]  Basically, I work back in receiving shipping freight room as well.
[01:00:39.639 --> 01:00:49.185]  I just wanted to point out, of course, I can kind of verify the information, basically helping unload trucks and process merchandise to get it ready to be put on trolleys and Z-Racks to be placed out on the floor for the employees to place the merchandise on the floor.
[01:00:50.005 --> 01:00:54.868]  And basically, all the boxes pretty much tell you where the stuff comes from, and the port of entries may be the U.S.
[01:00:54.888 --> 01:00:57.630]  of A., but mostly the majority of stuff comes from foreign countries.
[01:00:57.690 --> 01:00:58.270]  As a matter of fact,
[01:00:58.752 --> 01:01:06.499]  The last box I saw of something made in the US of A was made with pride of Minnesota back around Christmas time 2003 and those were some electronic thermostats and that was about it.
[01:01:06.519 --> 01:01:14.966]  I thought it was so important I cut out that part of the cardboard box and saved it ever since because it was made in the US of A. Yeah, we're now saving little made America things.
[01:01:15.226 --> 01:01:15.967]  It's a relic.
[01:01:16.027 --> 01:01:16.967]  It's unknown.
[01:01:17.067 --> 01:01:21.912]  It's... Yeah, it's basically so unusual and outstanding to the point that I just want to kind of save it as a keepsake.
[01:01:21.952 --> 01:01:22.332]  You're right.
[01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:25.134]  But basically, I just want to kind of inform you about what's going on there.
[01:01:25.154 --> 01:01:32.617]  And I want to say also, if I can, I appreciate the fact that you take a backbone strong stand and just giving us the full factual information, truth, facts, etc.
[01:01:32.657 --> 01:01:35.479]  Well, you give us the factual, truthful information, news, etc.
[01:01:35.899 --> 01:01:38.920]  And that you don't kowtow and bow down to the fact like some of these people do.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:49.325]  They won't approach what the George W. Bush administration is doing as far as they're part of the global, the New World Order system and the globalistic one world system as far as what they're doing to promote that agenda.
[01:01:49.365 --> 01:01:51.766]  Some of these people will, because I'm sure with all due respect,
[01:01:52.264 --> 01:02:05.029]  They're taking their 501c3s and 501c4 monies and basically they're getting their Faith Initiative monies also and they want to kind of come across as people trying to unravel the New World Order but the bottom line is they're not telling the full facts and giving us the full picture as to what's going on.
[01:02:05.049 --> 01:02:12.373]  So I appreciate the fact that you're going fully forward ahead and letting us know to the best of your ability the full facts and truth about what's going on Alex.
[01:02:12.393 --> 01:02:13.013]  Thank you very much.
[01:02:13.053 --> 01:02:15.494]  Well thank you Ken and Ken let me tell you one more thing.
[01:02:16.694 --> 01:02:17.015]  Are you there?
[01:02:17.355 --> 01:02:17.855]  Yes sir I'm here.
[01:02:18.709 --> 01:02:31.194]  Here at H-E-B in Austin, where employees heard me years ago say they'd soon be thumb scanning and then it would be for the customers, which has now started in College Station in Houston two years ago, a bunch of them have refused.
[01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:38.097]  Managers have refused under religious grounds, and they make them sign a waiver form, and I know you're afraid to probably get fired.
[01:02:38.137 --> 01:02:38.797]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:02:39.197 --> 01:02:45.460]  But if you can get enough people together and then they do fire you, you've got a major lawsuit, and it's going to take standing up to this to stop it.
[01:02:46.476 --> 01:02:49.217]  And there's other ways for people to clock in where it's confirmed.
[01:02:49.917 --> 01:02:51.297]  And they all know this.
[01:02:52.077 --> 01:02:56.498]  And so it's just part of getting us trained to accept this.
[01:02:57.098 --> 01:03:01.699]  And then the other thing about the New World Order, I would add, is the Republicans implement one part of it.
[01:03:01.739 --> 01:03:03.439]  There are two wheels on the right side.
[01:03:03.759 --> 01:03:06.480]  And the Democrats implement the other side, on the left side.
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:09.101]  And then the tank rolls forward.
[01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:11.401]  And so that's what's happening.
[01:03:12.054 --> 01:03:13.475]  And people better realize that.
[01:03:13.535 --> 01:03:15.215]  The Democrats think the Democrats will save them.
[01:03:15.235 --> 01:03:16.776]  The Republicans think the Republicans will save them.
[01:03:16.996 --> 01:03:18.257]  And that's why nothing ever changes.
[01:03:18.317 --> 01:03:19.077]  It just gets worse.
[01:03:20.218 --> 01:03:20.458]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:20.478 --> 01:03:21.078]  I hear what you're saying.
[01:03:21.138 --> 01:03:23.159]  If you'd like, I mean, I know you're a very busy person.
[01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:26.400]  If you'd like, I could send you, I've got several copies of this monthly publication that came out.
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.821]  If you'd like me to send it to you, I could.
[01:03:28.121 --> 01:03:28.381]  Yes.
[01:03:28.781 --> 01:03:29.061]  Yes.
[01:03:29.301 --> 01:03:29.662]  Please.
[01:03:30.062 --> 01:03:32.923]  One more time on your address here, if you don't mind.
[01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:35.124]  3001 and it's South Lamar.
[01:03:36.022 --> 01:03:37.643]  Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:03:38.504 --> 01:03:40.305]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:03:40.685 --> 01:03:41.446]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:03:41.926 --> 01:03:44.028]  We'll come back and talk to many others.
[01:03:44.968 --> 01:03:45.889]  So, stay with us.
[01:03:45.929 --> 01:03:47.290]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:47.790]  We'll be back.
[01:03:53.118 --> 01:03:55.940]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:56.900]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:04:00.322]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:04:00.523 --> 01:04:06.166]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:04:06.306 --> 01:04:09.348]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:04:09.588 --> 01:04:13.872]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:04:14.052 --> 01:04:15.974]  The chronic, everyday pain was miserable.
[01:04:16.094 --> 01:04:23.160]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.842]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:04:26.122 --> 01:04:30.446]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:04:30.726 --> 01:04:33.489]  After six weeks I noticed some improvement, and after twelve weeks,
[01:04:33.729 --> 01:04:34.670]  Measurable improvement.
[01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:37.293]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:40.076]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:04:40.237 --> 01:04:40.757]  Side effects?
[01:04:40.937 --> 01:04:43.220]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now too.
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:44.862]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:04:44.882 --> 01:04:45.082]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:04:45.182 --> 01:04:46.504]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:04:46.524 --> 01:04:47.145]  It worked for me.
[01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:54.553]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:54.953 --> 01:05:00.699]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:06.085]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:08.848]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove
[01:05:08.848 --> 01:05:09.308]  We're good to go!
[01:05:30.675 --> 01:05:36.658]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:36.918 --> 01:05:43.140]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:52.828 --> 01:05:57.175]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.335 --> 01:06:01.782]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:01.922 --> 01:06:06.308]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.348 --> 01:06:07.710]  The New World Order.
[01:06:08.431 --> 01:06:09.292]  Panama.
[01:06:09.473 --> 01:06:13.717]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.757 --> 01:06:20.705]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.825 --> 01:06:22.828]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:33.654]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.814 --> 01:06:39.177]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.761]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:06:54.247 --> 01:06:56.409]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.989 --> 01:06:59.871]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.761 --> 01:07:22.767]  All over the country, first they put the thumb scanners in for you to clock in at work, then they put them in for people paying with credit card or check,
[01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:34.924]  And then under the new national sales tax, which they're pitching as a replacement for the income tax, they're actually going to keep both, according to their own plans, you'll have to thumb scan even if you're paying cash.
[01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:50.014]  That's the official plan, now being put into place, we've been talking about that, and now they've come out and, oh, you're going to have to have a microchip if you're a cop or if you work for the government, and governments are already starting this around the world, starting with Mexico, now Italy moving to do it.
[01:07:51.375 --> 01:07:53.697]  All this unthinkable stuff is happening!
[01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:58.537]  But, a lot of neocons tell us that George Bush is going to save us.
[01:07:59.698 --> 01:08:02.440]  That George Bush is this wonderful conservative, and he's not.
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:07.223]  Republicans carry out one area of the New World Order, the Democrats carry out the other.
[01:08:09.144 --> 01:08:10.244]  They're kissing cousins.
[01:08:11.705 --> 01:08:12.946]  They work for the same system.
[01:08:13.646 --> 01:08:15.307]  But they give you the illusion of choice.
[01:08:15.427 --> 01:08:23.452]  Robert, Sharice, Michael, and Felix, and Louis, we're about to go to your calls, but here's an article out of Reason Online.
[01:08:25.373 --> 01:08:52.383]  And the reason, you know, is the libertarian slash conservative publication, slash liberal, you can't even put a title on it, but John Kerry's dark record on civil liberties, a Democratic candidate, is no friend of the Bill of Rights, and it details in a lengthy 14-page article how he's for the Patriot Act, Patriot Act II, all this tyranny, has always been for it, but the Democrats are all, I'm voting for Kerry, he's against the Patriot Act.
[01:08:52.972 --> 01:08:54.112]  Well, he's against the war.
[01:08:54.132 --> 01:08:56.913]  No, he wants to expand the war and go into Iran now!
[01:08:58.474 --> 01:08:59.574]  There's no difference!
[01:09:00.194 --> 01:09:01.215]  So we'll get into that, too.
[01:09:01.235 --> 01:09:03.435]  Let's talk to Robert in Texas.
[01:09:03.495 --> 01:09:04.316]  Robert, thanks for holding.
[01:09:04.336 --> 01:09:04.716]  Go ahead.
[01:09:04.736 --> 01:09:07.977]  I want to say that you're the best.
[01:09:08.697 --> 01:09:11.478]  If you were running for president, I would definitely vote for you.
[01:09:12.176 --> 01:09:14.997]  Well, one guy isn't going to save us unless it's Jesus Christ.
[01:09:15.477 --> 01:09:15.977]  You're right.
[01:09:16.017 --> 01:09:18.837]  And look, all of us have to get involved.
[01:09:19.237 --> 01:09:20.457]  All of us have to be leaders.
[01:09:20.878 --> 01:09:22.198]  And it's not about Alex Jones.
[01:09:22.258 --> 01:09:23.338]  It's not about anybody else.
[01:09:23.398 --> 01:09:25.358]  It's about fighting the New World Order.
[01:09:25.598 --> 01:09:27.519]  Yes, we're in a lot of trouble.
[01:09:28.759 --> 01:09:31.399]  But I listen to your shows.
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.220]  If I had the money, I would buy some tape.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:40.861]  I would buy Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:09:42.531 --> 01:09:44.773]  I listen to Eric Hutchings tape.
[01:09:46.054 --> 01:09:48.456]  I listen to Road to Terror.
[01:09:49.336 --> 01:09:52.719]  I listen to quite a few tapes.
[01:09:55.341 --> 01:09:57.002]  Are you blind?
[01:09:57.322 --> 01:09:57.582]  Yes.
[01:09:59.664 --> 01:10:01.445]  What I especially like was the
[01:10:02.776 --> 01:10:25.155]  It's a Freudian slip of Kerry and Bush, and I wish I had a way of getting it, because... Well, there's actually dozens of those by Bush and a whole bunch by Kerry, where Bush says we're going to create order, I mean chaos, I mean order out of chaos, which is an Illuminati quote, or Bush saying, you know, we're going to do everything we can to attack the American people, or Kerry saying we're going to double our terrorist forces.
[01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:29.098]  In fact, John, can you find that clip and play it?
[01:10:32.071 --> 01:10:36.818]  I was wondering if you'd be able to, uh, if you had the time or be able to maybe be a tape, bail it to me.
[01:10:36.838 --> 01:10:41.084]  Because I want to play it, I want to play it to my dad.
[01:10:41.465 --> 01:10:42.667]  You're wondering if I can do that?
[01:10:43.556 --> 01:10:43.916]  Yes sir.
[01:10:43.936 --> 01:10:44.137]  Yes sir.
[01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:44.817]  Yes sir.
[01:11:02.572 --> 01:11:09.074]  That I can't afford to give videos out for free and I have to fight to have time to brush my teeth twice a day or to eat good meals.
[01:11:09.114 --> 01:11:09.274]  Wow!
[01:11:09.654 --> 01:11:13.856]  I literally, I literally work on average 16 to 17 hours a day.
[01:11:13.876 --> 01:11:14.436]  Wow!
[01:11:14.456 --> 01:11:20.598]  I can't sit down and make you an audio transmission, uh, translation and then mail that to you.
[01:11:20.618 --> 01:11:26.579]  Uh, but I, I would hope that someone in your area, uh, would do that for you, sir.
[01:11:26.599 --> 01:11:28.500]  That would really be good if they would.
[01:11:30.602 --> 01:11:33.443]  If you were standing here right beside me, I would give you one of my videos.
[01:11:34.064 --> 01:11:39.225]  It's just that if I give an offer of free videos to everybody, I'll be out of business real quick.
[01:11:39.605 --> 01:11:40.786]  That's true, that's true.
[01:11:41.386 --> 01:11:44.667]  But I have listened to some of them and I really enjoyed them.
[01:11:45.988 --> 01:11:52.630]  And I think you're right, whether we have Kerry or whether we have Bush, we're still in trouble.
[01:11:54.534 --> 01:11:55.274]  I hear you, Robert.
[01:11:55.334 --> 01:11:56.715]  Thank you for the call.
[01:11:56.755 --> 01:11:58.496]  I really do appreciate that call.
[01:11:59.096 --> 01:12:01.037]  I forgot to ask him if he was on the computer.
[01:12:01.097 --> 01:12:06.800]  We'd be glad to report, sir, to give you a free account at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:07.320 --> 01:12:08.241]  It's 15 cents a day.
[01:12:08.261 --> 01:12:11.783]  Oh, you are still there?
[01:12:12.123 --> 01:12:14.244]  Do you have a computer?
[01:12:14.724 --> 01:12:15.625]  No, sir, I do not.
[01:12:15.905 --> 01:12:16.605]  Yeah.
[01:12:16.625 --> 01:12:17.926]  See, I can't buy you a computer.
[01:12:18.066 --> 01:12:21.067]  A computer with JAWS is about $7,000.
[01:12:24.418 --> 01:12:30.820]  I think that, I'm sure you know more about this than I do, but I think they have programs for the visually impaired folks.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:36.082]  They're pretty inexpensive where you just move the cursor over and it reads the text value.
[01:12:36.142 --> 01:12:37.242]  Right, that's JAWS.
[01:12:37.302 --> 01:12:38.303]  That's JAWS.
[01:12:39.403 --> 01:12:40.103]  That's speech value.
[01:12:40.143 --> 01:12:40.583]  And that's $7,000.
[01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:41.904]  That's $1,000.
[01:12:42.124 --> 01:12:42.344]  Oh, $1,000.
[01:12:42.704 --> 01:12:43.725]  I thought you said $7,000.
[01:12:43.945 --> 01:12:45.125]  Okay, well thank you for the call, sir.
[01:12:45.145 --> 01:12:46.145]  I appreciate your call.
[01:12:46.766 --> 01:12:48.466]  Let's talk to Charisse in Texas.
[01:12:48.986 --> 01:12:49.987]  A lot of calls from Texas.
[01:12:50.007 --> 01:12:50.867]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:12:51.773 --> 01:12:53.273]  I'm just livid today.
[01:12:53.373 --> 01:13:06.477]  I received a visit from the United States Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service who gave me a five-page form entitled Poultry 04 Small Production and Backyard Flock Questionnaire.
[01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:10.378]  Alex, this is the most intrusive, dusty bunch of crap I've ever seen in my life.
[01:13:12.019 --> 01:13:17.500]  I know it's on a small scale, but I have like ten chickens in my bed and a coop out back.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.781]  I live out in the middle of nowhere and one of the reasons why is because I
[01:13:21.294 --> 01:13:23.716]  You know, it'd be nice to be able to feed myself if I had to.
[01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:25.157]  And you want to be left alone?
[01:13:25.617 --> 01:13:26.358]  Oh, no joke!
[01:13:26.718 --> 01:13:35.804]  Well, the thing is, the response is voluntary and not required by law, but your report is needed to be as regional and national accurate as possible.
[01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:43.910]  They ask everything about how many you have, did they come from eggs, did they come from chicks that you ordered, and the disease thing.
[01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:47.552]  Okay, I can understand that, but it's, you know... Well, let me go over this.
[01:13:49.514 --> 01:13:55.776]  Back in 2000, they had the census, and they had people break down doors, people who weren't even police threatened to arrest people.
[01:13:56.136 --> 01:13:59.416]  They came to my house, demanded I answer all 54 questions.
[01:13:59.796 --> 01:14:12.800]  Some people got, one in six homes got the 54 question, and then out of it, I forget the numbers, but out of a couple hundred homes, I think was the number, you'd get several hundred questions of the small business survey.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:18.841]  Now they want to send this out to everybody, and there's all these new bureaucracies to
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.521]  Go out and track and trace what you're doing.
[01:14:21.882 --> 01:14:28.808]  They've actually begun to pass the laws to make you have tracker chips or RFID chips in all the cows, pigs, poultry.
[01:14:28.828 --> 01:14:31.370]  Yeah, they said they were going to be doing the chips.
[01:14:31.650 --> 01:14:35.594]  I mentioned to them that, well, at least you're not here to implant me and I think they misunderstood me.
[01:14:35.614 --> 01:14:38.116]  You know, and they said, well, yeah, that'll be next.
[01:14:38.176 --> 01:14:40.098]  And I said, no, no, I'm talking about humans.
[01:14:40.138 --> 01:14:42.500]  I said, you guys really should start paying attention to what you're doing.
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.822]  So they said that would be next where you'd have to chip your chickens.
[01:14:44.982 --> 01:14:46.003]  Animals, yeah, yeah.
[01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:49.839]  They're already having problems with beef and pigs.
[01:14:50.159 --> 01:14:51.640]  He said they'd already done sheep.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.383]  Yeah, they have the chips and then they go ahead and ship them with chips and people bite into a chip.
[01:14:57.103 --> 01:14:59.004]  They've had some big recalls lately.
[01:14:59.405 --> 01:15:05.488]  Well, you know, this is infuriating because I mean, I see bottom line, they're just making darn sure that we can't even feed ourselves.
[01:15:05.508 --> 01:15:06.709]  There is no escape.
[01:15:06.749 --> 01:15:10.771]  What they're doing is creating bureaucracies to harass small landholders.
[01:15:10.831 --> 01:15:15.314]  I mean, they show up with guys with clipboards and computers going, tell us where the wells are.
[01:15:15.354 --> 01:15:16.354]  We're just marking it down.
[01:15:16.395 --> 01:15:17.795]  You have to let us know where they are.
[01:15:17.815 --> 01:15:20.037]  And then they come slap a meter on your well.
[01:15:20.357 --> 01:15:24.639]  Well, I did manage to finagle them leaving me a copy, which they really didn't want to do at first.
[01:15:24.699 --> 01:15:26.720]  And they even left me two stamps to mail it back to them with.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.341]  Wasn't that sweet?
[01:15:27.441 --> 01:15:30.503]  Anyway, I can scan this if you'd like a copy.
[01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:35.136]  So you got 10 chickens and they showed up at your house?
[01:15:35.496 --> 01:15:37.117]  Well, they sat out there for a long time.
[01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:42.341]  It just so happened we were doing some working out there and my son and I saw them.
[01:15:42.381 --> 01:15:46.624]  You know, people stop there because it's like the only place you can use a cell phone in the whole county, I think, out here.
[01:15:47.044 --> 01:15:50.567]  I'm afraid to actually get a connection, but I don't pay attention too much when people stop.
[01:15:50.587 --> 01:15:52.288]  But they sat there for quite a while, obviously.
[01:15:52.328 --> 01:15:55.430]  They were snooping to see if they could see chickens way back.
[01:15:55.671 --> 01:15:58.913]  This is like back at least three, four hundred feet from the road.
[01:15:59.608 --> 01:16:01.149]  With the building in the way and everything else.
[01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:02.029]  Obviously, they were looking.
[01:16:02.049 --> 01:16:03.850]  I mean, I don't know where else they would know.
[01:16:03.870 --> 01:16:05.251]  Well, that's money well spent.
[01:16:05.331 --> 01:16:06.872]  Thank you for the call.
[01:16:06.912 --> 01:16:07.553]  I appreciate that.
[01:16:07.593 --> 01:16:08.093]  Yeah, alright.
[01:16:08.653 --> 01:16:09.274]  Send that along.
[01:16:09.294 --> 01:16:09.874]  That's interesting.
[01:16:10.974 --> 01:16:11.855]  Who's up next here?
[01:16:15.397 --> 01:16:15.717]  No?
[01:16:15.857 --> 01:16:17.058]  I got another caller after that.
[01:16:17.918 --> 01:16:19.119]  I've got my call orders out.
[01:16:19.139 --> 01:16:20.460]  I just talked to Charisse.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.421]  Michael in Washington.
[01:16:22.461 --> 01:16:23.041]  You're on the air.
[01:16:23.101 --> 01:16:23.762]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:16:25.383 --> 01:16:25.943]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:16:26.203 --> 01:16:26.723]  Hello, sir.
[01:16:28.174 --> 01:16:32.236]  Your show this morning is great, and like Robert and Ken said, you know, you're doing a great job.
[01:16:32.717 --> 01:16:33.737]  Don't be so modest.
[01:16:33.817 --> 01:16:37.039]  I mean, half of us wish we could do as much as you're doing.
[01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:42.422]  And for Robert, there's plenty of people out there that are putting Alex Jones out on the peer-to-peer programs.
[01:16:42.482 --> 01:16:45.143]  If you know anybody with a computer, they can get you the audio, no problem.
[01:16:45.344 --> 01:16:48.785]  Yeah, they can go download it for free and burn it on a 30-cent CD.
[01:16:48.925 --> 01:16:49.406]  Exactly.
[01:16:50.246 --> 01:16:56.930]  One thing I wanted to mention, you brought something up that reminded me of what I've been meaning to talk to you about, and you may have heard of it, but my friend,
[01:16:57.503 --> 01:17:01.364]  She's a single mother of two, and about four months ago she went down to Disneyland.
[01:17:02.264 --> 01:17:03.885]  And they made her thumb scan?
[01:17:04.165 --> 01:17:05.425]  No, no, it's better.
[01:17:06.006 --> 01:17:06.786]  I went over to visit her.
[01:17:06.806 --> 01:17:08.626]  They put RFID tracker bracelets on them?
[01:17:08.847 --> 01:17:09.347]  No, no.
[01:17:09.367 --> 01:17:11.567]  This has to do with conditioning.
[01:17:12.468 --> 01:17:20.530]  I went over to visit her a couple weeks ago, and her kid, her youngest boy, he's about five, six years old, he had about five GI Joes.
[01:17:21.510 --> 01:17:22.791]  And he's playing with them on the living room floor.
[01:17:23.427 --> 01:17:26.868]  And I'm a single mom, where do you get the male influence for a G.I.
[01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:27.608]  Joe, I'm thinking.
[01:17:28.289 --> 01:17:30.109]  And I go, you know, what's with all the G.I.
[01:17:30.129 --> 01:17:30.429]  Joes?
[01:17:31.049 --> 01:17:33.970]  And my friend says, well, we went down to Disneyland.
[01:17:34.771 --> 01:17:40.372]  And their biggest ride, their biggest event that the kids wanted to play on was Boot Camp.
[01:17:41.273 --> 01:17:45.514]  They have an actual event called Boot Camp.
[01:17:46.974 --> 01:17:48.435]  Now, is that conditioning or what?
[01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:54.849]  Well, for those who don't know, the actual SWAT team uniform is what kids watched on G.I.
[01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:58.151]  Joe 15-20 years ago, Cobra Commander.
[01:17:59.112 --> 01:18:09.379]  He wears a black ski mask, a black helmet, a black uniform, and the Travis County SWAT team actually wears an identical Cobra Commander uniform, even with the forward-facing Cobra.
[01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:17.485]  And they even have a black armored personnel carrier that Cobra Commander rode in, and they have one that looks just like it, with a little Cobra on the side.
[01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:21.130]  And they ride around in their Cobra Commander vehicle.
[01:18:21.750 --> 01:18:26.111]  And they have the little Cobra, and they fantasize about it.
[01:18:26.151 --> 01:18:29.892]  And it's admitted the Defense Department's been involved in children's cartoons for a long time.
[01:18:29.912 --> 01:18:31.552]  They get them to fantasize about all this.
[01:18:32.192 --> 01:18:35.253]  And yet our police are dressed up like Cobra Commander.
[01:18:35.833 --> 01:18:37.733]  They're making boot camp a great thing for kids.
[01:18:37.933 --> 01:18:39.394]  Well, I want to hear about this boot camp.
[01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:39.854]  Stay there.
[01:18:40.774 --> 01:18:45.155]  Yeah, no, I just know Disneyland, SeaWorld, all of them, it's actual hand scanners to get in.
[01:18:45.954 --> 01:18:47.137]  Well, you don't have to do it.
[01:18:47.177 --> 01:18:48.700]  You can pay double pricing.
[01:18:48.941 --> 01:18:51.306]  It's double if you don't scan.
[01:18:53.755 --> 01:19:02.377]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:19:02.597 --> 01:19:13.859]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:19:14.079 --> 01:19:16.739]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:17.079 --> 01:19:21.180]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:21.660]  I think so.
[01:19:38.031 --> 01:19:41.954]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:43.395]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:53.786 --> 01:19:55.288]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:19:55.488 --> 01:19:56.630]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:19:56.790 --> 01:20:00.215]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:20:00.315 --> 01:20:00.756]  Phenol!
[01:20:01.056 --> 01:20:08.125]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:20:08.686 --> 01:20:12.567]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:20:12.667 --> 01:20:13.127]  Fragrance?
[01:20:13.487 --> 01:20:18.269]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:20:18.389 --> 01:20:23.070]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[01:20:23.310 --> 01:20:25.871]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:20:26.111 --> 01:20:29.532]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:20:29.672 --> 01:20:33.193]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:20:33.433 --> 01:20:35.756]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:36.837]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:20:55.379 --> 01:20:57.161]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.661 --> 01:21:01.084]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:21:01.585 --> 01:21:02.245]  Let's update.
[01:21:02.766 --> 01:21:06.209]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:10.613]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:11.274 --> 01:21:12.235]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:12.255 --> 01:21:14.577]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:21:15.097 --> 01:21:16.018]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.260]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:21:18.661 --> 01:21:20.162]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:20.749 --> 01:21:22.730]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[01:21:24.071 --> 01:21:28.633]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:29.934 --> 01:21:32.095]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[01:21:32.496 --> 01:21:35.057]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:35.692 --> 01:21:37.073]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:37.494 --> 01:21:39.215]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:39.636 --> 01:21:41.618]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:21:42.018 --> 01:21:44.120]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:21:46.302 --> 01:21:48.444]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.

[01:21:53.661 --> 01:21:56.684]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:21:57.064 --> 01:21:59.586]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:59.806 --> 01:22:06.912]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:07.072 --> 01:22:10.375]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:22:10.615 --> 01:22:12.657]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:12.977 --> 01:22:20.804]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:21.064 --> 01:22:22.345]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:22:22.465 --> 01:22:32.412]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[01:22:43.819 --> 01:22:44.079]  That's 877-835-5555.
[01:22:54.225 --> 01:22:58.727]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:22:58.887 --> 01:23:01.829]  Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.
[01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:06.110]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.
[01:23:06.210 --> 01:23:10.652]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:23:10.832 --> 01:23:13.794]  Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.
[01:23:15.654 --> 01:23:19.176]  We've got a floating insurance for you.
[01:23:23.945 --> 01:23:28.731]  I'll tell you what, let's go ahead and play those clips for people that missed those.
[01:23:28.831 --> 01:23:36.200]  These are Bush at a press conference and of course Kerry during his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston.
[01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:37.562]  Now go ahead and play that again.
[01:23:38.584 --> 01:23:43.085]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:23:43.245 --> 01:23:46.145]  Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.
[01:23:46.406 --> 01:23:50.446]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.
[01:23:50.546 --> 01:23:55.047]  We will double our special forces to conduct terrorist operations.
[01:23:55.167 --> 01:23:58.068]  Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we.
[01:23:58.328 --> 01:24:02.289]  They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we.
[01:24:04.634 --> 01:24:08.979]  Look, Disney's at the heart of the New World Order, and they're involved in all this propaganda.
[01:24:09.019 --> 01:24:16.426]  You watch the different children's shows and films they've made, but I wasn't aware that they had the new ride or new amusement area called Boot Camp.
[01:24:16.727 --> 01:24:19.389]  Did you find out what is in the Boot Camp, Michael?
[01:24:19.570 --> 01:24:22.633]  Well, what she was telling me was it's kind of great for the parents.
[01:24:22.653 --> 01:24:25.596]  I mean, she didn't catch it, but when I went over to see her,
[01:24:26.058 --> 01:24:32.120]  You know, this poor little five-year-old kid's got this thousand-yard stare like he just got back from Vietnam, and he's got six G.I.
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:34.541]  Joes around him, and I'm going, you know, what's with the G.I.
[01:24:34.561 --> 01:24:34.861]  Joes?
[01:24:35.501 --> 01:24:38.402]  She tells me this, and she said, oh, it's the greatest thing, they have a boot camp.
[01:24:38.882 --> 01:24:48.946]  And she said, there's actually like a sergeant who watches the kids, and they go through the barrels, and they go up the ropes, and over the nets, and he likes yelling at them and coaching them on.
[01:24:49.688 --> 01:24:54.412]  And the parents can just kick back and eat popcorn and not have to worry about their kids for a while.
[01:24:54.632 --> 01:24:59.375]  So basically it's giving them a good experience and getting them ready for their service to the empire.
[01:24:59.496 --> 01:25:01.357]  He came back and he just had to have all these G.I.
[01:25:01.377 --> 01:25:03.258]  Joes and she's going, now he wants the submarine.
[01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:04.639]  I guess there's a submarine they can put him in.
[01:25:04.699 --> 01:25:06.221]  It's like 200 bucks and she can't afford it.
[01:25:06.261 --> 01:25:08.622]  I'm going, oh man, you know why they're doing that?
[01:25:08.662 --> 01:25:09.623]  And I explained it to her.
[01:25:10.304 --> 01:25:11.825]  And she goes, wow, I never thought of that.
[01:25:12.835 --> 01:25:14.556]  And I mean, here's the deal, folks.
[01:25:14.957 --> 01:25:20.180]  Then they send your kids off to breathe a plethora of uranium, they give them experimental shots, they put them in 160 countries.
[01:25:20.501 --> 01:25:21.521]  Thanks for the call, Michael.
[01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:22.582]  Very interesting.
[01:25:22.682 --> 01:25:26.965]  Felix, Felix from, where are you calling from, Felix?
[01:25:27.585 --> 01:25:28.206]  I'm from Austin.
[01:25:28.686 --> 01:25:29.226]  Welcome, sir.
[01:25:29.247 --> 01:25:35.271]  Yeah, I was watching the late local propaganda, oh, I mean, news last night, and
[01:25:36.895 --> 01:25:39.036]  Uh, you know, the report is out of Cedar Park.
[01:25:39.056 --> 01:25:41.217]  Those kids got arrested for terroristic threat.
[01:25:41.297 --> 01:25:57.605]  So anyway, they report on that, and then they go to the, uh, the clip of the guys in ski masks, and they show them, you know, racing into schools with live ammunition, and, you know, get down, get down, get down, and, you know, and then they got ski masks on, and they're like,
[01:25:58.168 --> 01:25:58.629]  No, I missed it.
[01:25:58.649 --> 01:26:01.853]  We also posted an article where an 8 year old and a 6 year old got in a shoving match
[01:26:13.730 --> 01:26:23.152]  And the police arrested the 8-year-old and have put him in the jail with the offenders and are charging him as an adult for pushing and shoving.
[01:26:23.612 --> 01:26:25.812]  But, no, I haven't been watching the local news.
[01:26:25.892 --> 01:26:26.673]  What happened?
[01:26:26.813 --> 01:26:31.854]  Well, now, it's like every time I watch the news, I watch it with new eyes, you know.
[01:26:32.074 --> 01:26:37.855]  And every story from sports on up, I mean, it's all propaganda.
[01:26:37.915 --> 01:26:38.795]  It's all lies.
[01:26:38.855 --> 01:26:43.296]  And they talk to us like we're these... So what happened in Cedar Park?
[01:26:43.973 --> 01:26:55.890]  Well basically the kids got arrested and what not and I'm just letting you know that after that... I know they just charged some kids, you know, yell at the teacher and you get charged with the Patriot Act, but I mean what happened here in Austin?
[01:26:56.450 --> 01:27:00.015]  Two kids in Cedar Park were planning on murdering
[01:27:01.641 --> 01:27:08.568]  Yeah, there was a town last year outside Austin where, quote, they heard a plan.
[01:27:08.608 --> 01:27:16.897]  What happens is this is in all the kids' magazines and books, and they talk about it all the time and have drills about it, and then kids will joke around or say something, and, oh, it's an emergency!
[01:27:16.917 --> 01:27:17.837]  They're all terrorists!
[01:27:17.898 --> 01:27:18.438]  Arrest them!
[01:27:19.019 --> 01:27:24.925]  Right, so they go down and arrest them, and then, you know, the local news station, I don't want to mention any names, but...
[01:27:25.834 --> 01:27:42.132]  You know, they come on with their, you know, uh, alert or tactical block team or whatever, and then they show them going into the schools and, and, you know, with, uh, live ammunition, blowing up, blowing holes through walls, what not, and killing fake people, you know?
[01:27:42.892 --> 01:27:44.134]  Oh, so they show the drill?
[01:27:44.654 --> 01:27:45.655]  Oh yeah, they show the drill.
[01:27:45.676 --> 01:27:47.858]  Do they have children as role players during the drill?
[01:27:49.412 --> 01:27:50.753]  No, they had their own people doing it.
[01:27:50.773 --> 01:27:54.356]  Because a few years ago, during one of these drills, they killed the cop of the year with live ammo.
[01:27:54.976 --> 01:27:58.378]  And then we see these articles up in Detroit, they blew a girl's face off.
[01:27:59.139 --> 01:28:01.561]  Last time I heard, she was in critical condition during a drill.
[01:28:02.501 --> 01:28:09.206]  And so, uh, imagine if... So the drills, statistically, are more dangerous than the actual threat of school shootings.
[01:28:09.246 --> 01:28:12.168]  Yeah, so these drills, man, I mean, they were like... They were getting on it.
[01:28:12.228 --> 01:28:18.733]  You know, I'm a former Marine, and, uh, I was in the Marine Corps, uh, last year at Bush, in the first couple years of, uh, Clinton, and, uh,
[01:28:19.293 --> 01:28:21.555]  That's all we used to do was train urban assault.
[01:28:21.735 --> 01:28:27.261]  So they were going, get the bleak down, go rotate, get down, I'm going to blow, get him, move, move, move, move, yeah.
[01:28:27.661 --> 01:28:30.103]  Yeah, this clip, it was exactly like that Alex.
[01:28:30.143 --> 01:28:32.425]  This clip was like, they weren't messing around.
[01:28:32.445 --> 01:28:33.546]  They were like, get down, get down.
[01:28:33.586 --> 01:28:34.888]  They were shooting rounds off.
[01:28:35.328 --> 01:28:38.211]  You know, they were having, you know, fake casualties.
[01:28:38.231 --> 01:28:41.494]  They were wearing their black ski mats and their paintball mats.
[01:28:41.534 --> 01:28:42.615]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.165 --> 01:28:45.068]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.569 --> 01:28:47.174]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.096 --> 01:28:50.763]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.013 --> 01:29:01.495]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.915 --> 01:29:06.157]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.397 --> 01:29:13.420]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:19.902]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.063 --> 01:29:21.263]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.603 --> 01:29:24.566]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.706 --> 01:29:26.688]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.049 --> 01:29:34.276]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.576 --> 01:29:38.000]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:13.846]  Once the blinders come off, once somebody sees the big picture, they realize how bad the propaganda is and how, frankly, ridiculous it is.
[01:32:14.386 --> 01:32:24.090]  I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I'm on an exercise bike or something, I've got a Walkman that has UHF, VHF, and I'll listen to the local newscast.
[01:32:24.170 --> 01:32:25.971]  And most nights it's like this.
[01:32:26.933 --> 01:32:28.213]  Toll roads are good for you.
[01:32:28.253 --> 01:32:29.414]  Mercury is nutritious.
[01:32:29.454 --> 01:32:30.754]  SWAT teams are everywhere.
[01:32:31.374 --> 01:32:33.395]  Cameras are being put up to face scan you.
[01:32:34.395 --> 01:32:39.956]  I mean literally, I've actually before sat there and taken notes watching TV, just a random nightly newscast.
[01:32:40.276 --> 01:32:42.197]  You've got to have vaccines to go to school.
[01:32:43.717 --> 01:32:46.698]  Parents are bad and CPS is out investigating everybody.
[01:32:48.918 --> 01:32:54.860]  Juvenile crime is a big problem and so now if your child misses class one time, they'll be charged with a criminal crime of
[01:32:55.666 --> 01:32:57.407]  Truancy, and he'll be investigated.
[01:32:57.427 --> 01:33:00.107]  I mean, it's just like... It's disgusting!
[01:33:00.147 --> 01:33:02.288]  And then now, for the weather, and then for some sports.
[01:33:04.449 --> 01:33:16.252]  And so the caller talks about these drills, and all the stuff that's going on, and they're charging kids with terrorism under the Patriot Act, and SWAT teams, you know, yelling and screaming at children in drills, and... It's scary, folks!
[01:33:16.272 --> 01:33:17.633]  We're being trained to live under this!
[01:33:19.073 --> 01:33:21.034]  And, uh, it's... it's just out of control!
[01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:24.771]  But we've all got to get self-sufficient.
[01:33:24.791 --> 01:33:30.273]  We've got to create our own media, our own access TV shows, our own radio shows, our own websites, our own local newsletters.
[01:33:30.733 --> 01:33:32.014]  There's something all of you can do.
[01:33:32.034 --> 01:33:35.235]  You can get my films and make copies of them and get them out to people.
[01:33:35.575 --> 01:33:36.696]  It's having a huge effect.
[01:33:36.716 --> 01:33:39.997]  The awakening has never been this big or has never happened this fast.
[01:33:40.117 --> 01:33:44.199]  And you can get proficient with the Second Amendment to defend yourself and your family from
[01:33:45.191 --> 01:33:47.352]  From tyrants and just your average street thugs.
[01:33:47.412 --> 01:33:48.732]  You can get some storable food.
[01:33:48.772 --> 01:33:50.713]  You can stop drinking the poisonous water.
[01:33:50.753 --> 01:33:52.294]  You can start taking high-quality vitamins.
[01:33:52.594 --> 01:33:53.714]  Get your nutrition together.
[01:33:53.974 --> 01:33:59.777]  There's so much you can do to focus yourself and consciously get yourself out of this system.
[01:34:01.037 --> 01:34:03.958]  You know, an old lady can pick up a car when her child's stuck under it.
[01:34:05.319 --> 01:34:13.162]  Well, societally, with our minds, we can all get involved and use our ingenuity to fight the new world order and we, the people, can leverage it off of us.
[01:34:13.777 --> 01:34:15.597]  To use that analogy like I did last week.
[01:34:18.178 --> 01:34:19.338]  It is so important.
[01:34:21.019 --> 01:34:26.660]  And it's so important that we support venues of information like this one.
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:35.982]  For the next 5-10 minutes, we're going to have a guest on, then we're going to go to Lewis and Don and Bart and Fred and Roger and everybody else.
[01:34:36.002 --> 01:34:39.623]  Then we're going to go to John Kerry and his record on loving the police state.
[01:34:39.643 --> 01:34:41.663]  It's not just George W. Bush.
[01:34:42.751 --> 01:34:46.892]  But before we do that, I probably haven't had him on in six months, and it's good to bring him back on.
[01:34:46.932 --> 01:34:47.712]  He's Ted Anderson.
[01:34:48.593 --> 01:34:50.453]  He is the Grand Patriarch, the owner.
[01:34:51.594 --> 01:34:53.654]  I'm being a little bit politically incorrect there, folks.
[01:34:54.394 --> 01:34:57.115]  Of the GCN Radio Network, he also owns Midas Resources.
[01:34:58.335 --> 01:35:05.738]  And they've got half-ounce, semi-numismatic gold coins at the lowest price I've heard of.
[01:35:06.118 --> 01:35:07.738]  This gold's gone up in price.
[01:35:08.558 --> 01:35:10.499]  This was the price for months and months and months ago.
[01:35:11.936 --> 01:35:18.463]  I've searched around, I've bought gold several times, and I've searched around and looked at other prices, and I've always gone and got it from Midas Resources.
[01:35:19.164 --> 01:35:28.395]  We also have another deal for you where you get a couple citizen rule books and a silver dollar with another package you can get to educate yourself about real money and to get a
[01:35:29.184 --> 01:35:37.872]  Beautiful little 70 something page booklet with the Bill of Rights, Declaration of Independence, Constitution, famous quotes, how juries are supposed to operate.
[01:35:38.152 --> 01:35:39.333]  We're going to offer that as well.
[01:35:40.394 --> 01:35:42.336]  Ted Anderson, good to have you on with us my friend.
[01:35:43.737 --> 01:35:44.618]  Great to be here Alex.
[01:35:45.943 --> 01:35:49.565]  Hadn't had you on in a while, and it's good to get you back up here on the air.
[01:35:50.325 --> 01:35:54.247]  People who've got money in the bank, I mean, JP Morgan's dumping their stock.
[01:35:54.287 --> 01:35:55.528]  All this weird stuff's happening.
[01:35:55.548 --> 01:35:57.149]  They admitted there's a big terror attack.
[01:35:57.549 --> 01:35:58.650]  Things could really plunge.
[01:35:58.690 --> 01:36:03.352]  The dollar's been devalued by upwards of 40% in the last two years against the euro.
[01:36:03.732 --> 01:36:06.834]  So a little bit of cash I got in the bank's all been devalued massively.
[01:36:07.274 --> 01:36:14.038]  The average person isn't even aware of this trend, but we can still get gold that is worth the same thing it was worth 6,000 years ago.
[01:36:15.370 --> 01:36:16.251]  Yeah, you sure can.
[01:36:16.271 --> 01:36:21.215]  You know, the thing is, it's one of the few assets that you can really track as being valuable.
[01:36:21.255 --> 01:36:22.196]  It's silver as well.
[01:36:22.236 --> 01:36:30.022]  You know, those of you who claim to be Christians all know that Christ was turned in for silver pieces.
[01:36:30.834 --> 01:36:38.638]  And gold has been used way back in the Egyptian times, certainly well known, more popular than the U.S.
[01:36:38.678 --> 01:36:40.899]  dollar has ever even dreamed of becoming.
[01:36:41.499 --> 01:36:46.862]  And I'm reading the International Forecaster, Alex, and I think we ought to offer this too.
[01:36:47.743 --> 01:36:57.427]  This most recent International Forecaster has an in-depth page put together on the IMF and the G7.
[01:36:58.308 --> 01:37:00.289]  And currently, right now, they're meeting in Washington.
[01:37:01.014 --> 01:37:10.643]  And what Bob Chapman is publishing is that George and the neocons, which is what you're referring to, George Bush, they're pushing to devaluate the U.S.
[01:37:10.683 --> 01:37:14.366]  dollar by 20% and they're also wanting to devaluate the euro by 20%.
[01:37:14.566 --> 01:37:17.128]  Now that's on top of what they've already done.
[01:37:17.388 --> 01:37:18.149]  Right, exactly.
[01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:24.755]  And now they're going to devalue us up against all these other countries like Japan, China, India.
[01:37:25.035 --> 01:37:33.504]  Yep, and then of course that puts gold up to a value of about $480, and the central banks have been suppressing the price of gold, trying to keep it at that $400 level.
[01:37:33.524 --> 01:37:36.507]  And by the way, gold is really diminishing supply.
[01:37:36.567 --> 01:37:39.470]  It's not like diamonds that are artificially scarce.
[01:37:39.550 --> 01:37:40.751]  Gold is truly scarce.
[01:37:40.991 --> 01:37:41.531]  Yes, it is.
[01:37:41.571 --> 01:37:44.672]  As a matter of fact, there's a very finite supply in gold.
[01:37:45.152 --> 01:37:50.154]  And if it was, what do we have, about maybe 1.5% of the people involved in that market?
[01:37:50.654 --> 01:37:55.636]  If you put 10% of the people in the United States into the gold market, gold would just go crazy.
[01:37:56.116 --> 01:37:59.097]  And there's a Blanchard lawsuit coming up real short.
[01:37:59.677 --> 01:38:00.959]  I bought gold three years ago.
[01:38:00.979 --> 01:38:02.421]  I bought gold two years ago.
[01:38:03.042 --> 01:38:05.686]  I didn't buy a lot because I can't afford a lot.
[01:38:14.443 --> 01:38:21.286]  That investment, gold I bought, coins I bought for $300, I can sell for $500 right now.
[01:38:21.646 --> 01:38:23.807]  That's performing a lot better than the stock market.
[01:38:24.027 --> 01:38:25.167]  Well, obviously so.
[01:38:25.207 --> 01:38:29.089]  I mean, there's a lot of people that are sitting on about 10% of what they put into the stock market.
[01:38:29.569 --> 01:38:31.990]  Even 25% is bad enough.
[01:38:32.930 --> 01:38:36.532]  People are watching that market dwindle and just lag on.
[01:38:36.592 --> 01:38:37.592]  And gold did come up.
[01:38:38.172 --> 01:38:39.313]  It's up from about $248 an ounce.
[01:38:42.274 --> 01:38:47.535]  And currently right now it's at $417 at the bid and $418.10 at the ask.
[01:38:47.916 --> 01:38:50.516]  Which is, you know, that's a real strong price for gold.
[01:38:51.036 --> 01:38:55.638]  And here Chapman's talking about $480 announced after this devaluation occurs.
[01:38:56.118 --> 01:39:00.099]  And for those of you who haven't had a chance to read Chapman's newsletter... By the way, Ted, I don't mean to interrupt you.
[01:39:00.119 --> 01:39:04.820]  That's another reason we're paying more for fuel, is that the dollar's been devalued by
[01:39:05.500 --> 01:39:07.763]  39 to 40 percent depending on where it is each day.
[01:39:08.123 --> 01:39:10.286]  And so it's going to take more of our dollars to buy that oil.
[01:39:10.306 --> 01:39:10.626]  Go ahead.
[01:39:10.746 --> 01:39:11.167]  Oh, sure.
[01:39:11.247 --> 01:39:14.110]  And the price per barrel on oil hit a peak again today.
[01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:17.333]  And then that gets passed on to everything else that moves by truck.
[01:39:17.553 --> 01:39:18.214]  It sure does.
[01:39:18.294 --> 01:39:23.380]  It's going to affect food, clothing, shelter, anything that, you know, I mean... Everything's going up, man.
[01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:24.661]  All my bills are going up.
[01:39:24.781 --> 01:39:27.602]  Yep, so you're simply not going to get away from this.
[01:39:27.702 --> 01:39:29.763]  But back to Chapman, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:35.405]  Yeah, well, Chapman just does such a great job of explaining how this thing all works and pulls together.
[01:39:35.425 --> 01:39:38.986]  I mean, he covers the Japanese, China, it covers the U.S.
[01:39:39.046 --> 01:39:44.107]  markets, the European markets, and he really does put together quite a newsletter here.
[01:39:44.127 --> 01:39:49.269]  And for those of you who haven't seen a copy of it, it's about 24 pages, and it's in-depth.
[01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:56.072]  Written in such a way that anybody can understand what he's trying to say.
[01:39:56.152 --> 01:39:58.073]  And so folks, you can call and get a free copy of that.
[01:39:58.093 --> 01:39:59.554]  Tell them about the gold specialty.
[01:39:59.574 --> 01:40:00.615]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:40:00.655 --> 01:40:07.018]  I ran into a great group of $10 gold pieces, and currently right now I have them for $275 a coin.
[01:40:07.378 --> 01:40:11.060]  And like you said, Alex, I mean, this is the price that they were when gold was down there in the $300 range.
[01:40:12.601 --> 01:40:13.921]  That is a great buy on $10 Liberties.
[01:40:13.961 --> 01:40:16.802]  For the rolls of $20, it's going to be $2,750 for rolls of $20.
[01:40:17.002 --> 01:40:21.824]  If you pick up that roll of $20, ask for the Chapman Newsletter and ask for the Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:40:31.537 --> 01:40:40.340]  I just got to say, it really helps the network out, and it helps this show, and getting the message out there, and this is really a great buy on Tens anyways.
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:47.462]  I've seen Tens out there for sale for $320, $290, and so that's a great deal.
[01:40:47.502 --> 01:40:52.063]  In fact, I might even get a few of those from you next week.
[01:40:52.583 --> 01:40:54.403]  In fact, I talked to you on Monday.
[01:40:54.503 --> 01:40:57.784]  I actually called to maybe buy some gold, a few more coins.
[01:40:57.824 --> 01:40:59.745]  Ted said, hey, how about I come on the show?
[01:41:00.765 --> 01:41:05.367]  Folks, I hope you'll take advantage of this for the free newsletter or to call and get some of these coins.
[01:41:06.047 --> 01:41:10.769]  Or there's the deal for $24.95, two Citizen Rule books, and a silver dollar.
[01:41:11.810 --> 01:41:14.691]  Folks, very important to get this material.
[01:41:14.951 --> 01:41:16.152]  Give them that number, Ted.
[01:41:16.512 --> 01:41:17.552]  Okay, they can reach us at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:41:22.134 --> 01:41:22.854]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:41:23.595 --> 01:41:30.178]  Ask for the $10 special at $275 a coin.
[01:41:30.818 --> 01:41:36.261]  Don't wait until your dollar has dropped even further and you have to pay the $300 range for these coins.
[01:41:36.581 --> 01:41:37.541]  There's no sense in that.
[01:41:38.001 --> 01:41:44.624]  In addition to this, if you want those two silver dollars in the Citizen Rulebook, you can currently pick those up right now for $24.99.
[01:41:46.846 --> 01:41:49.968]  $24.95.
[01:41:47.386 --> 01:41:49.968]  So $24.95 gets to the Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:41:50.028 --> 01:41:50.808]  Two silver dollars.
[01:41:50.888 --> 01:41:54.651]  And we've all been seeing silver at $7.18 right now.
[01:41:54.791 --> 01:41:55.191]  I'm sorry, $7.20.
[01:41:56.332 --> 01:42:01.556]  And the silver dollars have shot up from the $8 range into the $15 range now.
[01:42:02.036 --> 01:42:05.918]  And so you take two $15 silver dollars, that's $30 right there.
[01:42:05.979 --> 01:42:08.120]  So we're doing two silver dollars in a Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:42:08.658 --> 01:42:09.419]  Yep, that's right.
[01:42:09.439 --> 01:42:12.142]  Because in the past we did two World Books and one Silver Dollar.
[01:42:12.162 --> 01:42:13.283]  Well, that's an even better deal.
[01:42:13.744 --> 01:42:15.366]  Okay, so give them that number again, Ted.
[01:42:15.626 --> 01:42:16.307]  Well, the number is 1-800-686-2237.
[01:42:16.327 --> 01:42:17.608]  And Alex, I've got to correct myself.
[01:42:17.628 --> 01:42:18.810]  I said rolls a 20 on 10s, a 275 is 27.50.
[01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:19.350]  That's 10 coins.
[01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:19.991]  It's actually $5,500.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:29.021]  For a roll of 20.
[01:42:29.281 --> 01:42:30.923]  There's a lot of people picking these things up.
[01:42:30.963 --> 01:42:33.146]  And I'd really suggest that the people that are out there do it.
[01:42:33.386 --> 01:42:34.067]  I mean, think about it.
[01:42:34.087 --> 01:42:37.231]  If you're in the Nazi regime, and you watch that Weimar Republic.
[01:42:37.271 --> 01:42:38.672]  No, it just dropped down to nothing.
[01:42:38.713 --> 01:42:40.835]  And then you have Hitler trying to run the place.
[01:42:41.436 --> 01:42:42.757]  Guns are being taken away.
[01:42:43.318 --> 01:42:44.800]  The rights of the citizen are gone.
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:52.970]  One of the few ways that people got out of that country is by having gold, or jewelry, or emeralds, and this kind of thing.
[01:42:53.010 --> 01:43:01.742]  But gold was the most liquid asset you could have, and it was a real easy way to sneak across the borders into Switzerland by bribing your way out.
[01:43:02.162 --> 01:43:02.422]  The U.S.
[01:43:02.442 --> 01:43:05.404]  dollar is... Well, it's just good to have in case the dollar goes belly up.
[01:43:06.125 --> 01:43:06.645]  And again, 1-800-686-2237?
[01:43:06.665 --> 01:43:06.825]  Yep, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:43:06.845 --> 01:43:08.046]  Give us a call.
[01:43:08.086 --> 01:43:10.128]  Pick up those phones.
[01:43:10.148 --> 01:43:11.549]  Hey, Ted?
[01:43:11.589 --> 01:43:16.472]  Ted, how about you stay with us for another segment and let's take some calls?
[01:43:16.832 --> 01:43:17.052]  Okay.
[01:43:17.332 --> 01:43:19.514]  Because Ted's an interesting guy.
[01:43:19.594 --> 01:43:21.856]  Let's just have Ted Wright shotgun with us a few minutes here.
[01:43:22.576 --> 01:43:23.397]  Thanks for holding.
[01:43:23.597 --> 01:43:25.578]  Let's talk to Lewis in Georgia.
[01:43:25.638 --> 01:43:26.559]  Lewis, you're on the air.
[01:43:26.619 --> 01:43:27.059]  Go ahead.
[01:43:27.319 --> 01:43:27.640]  Hi, Alex.
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:28.520]  How are you doing today?
[01:43:28.700 --> 01:43:29.040]  Good, sir.
[01:43:29.461 --> 01:43:29.681]  Great.
[01:43:30.277 --> 01:43:32.520]  I want to commend you on your forum and format.
[01:43:32.540 --> 01:43:38.526]  This is an excellent way for things that are not getting out to the general public to get on out.
[01:43:38.867 --> 01:43:44.513]  And I would hope that everyone will go ahead and get them a shortwave radio so they'll be able to pick this stuff up.
[01:43:45.259 --> 01:43:46.459]  Very vital and necessary.
[01:43:46.740 --> 01:43:47.200]  Exactly.
[01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:51.321]  If you don't have an AM or FM in your area and don't like being tied to your computer, get a shortwave, folks.
[01:43:51.361 --> 01:43:55.363]  We're on the big blowtorch, WWCR, but what's on your mind, sir?
[01:43:56.243 --> 01:44:04.386]  I was wondering, is there a way that, you know, when they have aircraft that's in the air, do they ever record the radar?
[01:44:04.646 --> 01:44:06.407]  You know, what goes on on the radar?
[01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:07.868]  Are you aware?
[01:44:07.888 --> 01:44:13.930]  Yes, they do record that, and then those tapes were destroyed after 9-11 and covered that up.
[01:44:14.537 --> 01:44:19.521]  Well, I've had a question that's been really, really on my mind lately.
[01:44:19.541 --> 01:44:32.010]  I went to the site, 911inplanesite.com, and I was kind of surprised to see, just as you had said, that those planes didn't have any windows.
[01:44:32.550 --> 01:44:38.175]  And since they didn't, we were told that those were commercial airliners that struck those buildings.
[01:44:38.915 --> 01:44:40.036]  What happened to the people?
[01:44:42.699 --> 01:44:44.100]  That is not my film.
[01:44:44.861 --> 01:44:48.526]  That's Dave von Kleist's film and I appreciate your call.
[01:44:48.787 --> 01:44:49.448]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:49.508 --> 01:44:51.711]  Let me try to just go over this briefly.
[01:44:53.493 --> 01:44:58.640]  I think those are important questions that are asked in the film and we raised those years ago and I'm glad I made a film about it.
[01:44:59.892 --> 01:45:07.415]  We stick to Bush flying the Bin Ladens out, having prior knowledge, public officials not supposed to fly.
[01:45:07.775 --> 01:45:10.256]  We stick to Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[01:45:10.276 --> 01:45:18.298]  government plan that says they would stage people getting on planes, then land those planes somewhere else, and then fly remote control planes and crash them.
[01:45:18.699 --> 01:45:19.919]  Now that's the official government plan.
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:23.703]  We stick to NORAD standing down for an hour and 25 minutes.
[01:45:24.364 --> 01:45:33.654]  We stick to CIA drills in the morning of 9-11, where they had hijacked jets flying to the Pentagon and World Trade Center, so NORAD stood down thinking it was a drill.
[01:45:33.674 --> 01:45:34.695]  I mean, what's the chances of that?
[01:45:36.042 --> 01:45:37.583]  I go into all of those areas.
[01:45:38.143 --> 01:45:40.964]  Building 7, the owners saying they blew it up.
[01:45:41.044 --> 01:45:42.384]  Saying it had explosives in it.
[01:45:42.704 --> 01:45:43.785]  The firefighters saying it.
[01:45:43.805 --> 01:45:44.625]  The seismographs.
[01:45:45.485 --> 01:45:48.487]  But no, we can't answer the question of where the people went or what happened.
[01:45:49.807 --> 01:45:51.328]  That's why I don't particularly focus on that.
[01:45:51.708 --> 01:45:54.849]  What I do do is, I look at the things we can prove.
[01:45:55.489 --> 01:45:55.969]  We're good to go.
[01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:17.895]  Yeah, well, I mean, obviously, there's manipulation going on there.
[01:46:17.915 --> 01:46:22.577]  I mean, if you have the right name and you have the right strings to pull, you're going to be able to fly wherever you want to.
[01:46:23.077 --> 01:46:29.720]  And, you know, they're going to make up stories, oh, jeez, I just got out of the way, or I'm off track a little bit.
[01:46:31.100 --> 01:46:32.701]  You can see it as it goes on here.
[01:46:32.721 --> 01:46:38.583]  If you're in the right political arena, you're certainly going to be able to do what you want to in this world.
[01:46:39.907 --> 01:46:43.008]  And get a lot of police state powers out of scaring people into submission.
[01:46:43.648 --> 01:46:47.089]  Uh, let us now go ahead and talk to Don in Pennsylvania.
[01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:48.909]  Uh, Don, you're on the air.
[01:46:48.949 --> 01:46:49.269]  Welcome.
[01:46:49.809 --> 01:46:50.290]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:50.350 --> 01:46:50.910]  How you doing?
[01:46:50.970 --> 01:46:51.250]  Good.
[01:46:51.710 --> 01:46:51.970]  Alright.
[01:46:52.170 --> 01:46:54.111]  Long time no talk to you.
[01:46:54.131 --> 01:47:02.393]  Ted, I know this will be off the wall here for you, but, you know, I've been buying coins and all that off you and your other, you know, associates there.
[01:47:02.833 --> 01:47:08.054]  But my question is, you know, during this whole show and through GCN,
[01:47:09.143 --> 01:47:17.868]  Uh, everyone keeps saying about how wicked it is, and I'd just like to ask, uh, do your employees get paid in notes or real money?
[01:47:18.588 --> 01:47:26.112]  And, or, why, if they do, have to go pay a, you know, income taxes and Social Security?
[01:47:26.412 --> 01:47:26.952]  I'll let you go.
[01:47:27.832 --> 01:47:31.434]  Well, let me ask you, where you work, sir, how do they pay you?
[01:47:31.454 --> 01:47:35.056]  Oh, well, he hung up.
[01:47:35.995 --> 01:47:37.536]  Ted, what does your wife eat for dinner?
[01:47:37.716 --> 01:47:38.556]  Go ahead and tell us.
[01:47:38.576 --> 01:47:39.756]  Well, I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:47:39.776 --> 01:47:43.457]  You know, it is the system that we have to live within right now at this time.
[01:47:44.577 --> 01:47:45.558]  And the U.S.
[01:47:45.598 --> 01:47:50.719]  government requires, you know, by law, that we use Federal Reserve notes as currency.
[01:47:50.759 --> 01:47:52.840]  We have to accept that as payment on debt.
[01:47:53.500 --> 01:48:00.822]  And, you know, I don't like the system, and I don't think you like the system, and the fellow that called about it, I'm sure that he doesn't like the system either.
[01:48:00.862 --> 01:48:01.842]  That's what he's pointing out.
[01:48:04.629 --> 01:48:10.852]  The way to beat the system isn't by complaining about it, it's by taking action like Alex has been here.
[01:48:11.592 --> 01:48:19.296]  The Genesis Communications Network has obviously created a huge impact on society and it's waking people up.
[01:48:19.336 --> 01:48:21.457]  You wake enough people up, you can change the system.
[01:48:21.997 --> 01:48:25.279]  I mean, I would like to see the Federal Reserve System dismantled completely.
[01:48:25.639 --> 01:48:27.100]  Absolutely, let's take a call.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:29.901]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bart in Texas.
[01:48:29.941 --> 01:48:31.082]  Bart, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:48:31.642 --> 01:48:32.202]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:32.962 --> 01:48:41.805]  I'm calling, you know, first I wanted to tell you about something that's going on down here, but before I did that I wanted to touch on something that you mentioned before you went to the guest.
[01:48:41.825 --> 01:48:42.365]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:48:42.826 --> 01:48:48.147]  And that is the most critical thing that we can do right now, is we have to engage this problem.
[01:48:48.407 --> 01:48:56.470]  You know, a lot of people out there are listening to you right now, and the information is interesting, but the information is actually secondary to the action.
[01:48:57.150 --> 01:49:00.472]  We have to get into the street, however people can.
[01:49:00.512 --> 01:49:02.013]  They have to get involved in this.
[01:49:02.213 --> 01:49:03.414]  It has to become visible.
[01:49:03.855 --> 01:49:12.340]  Monthly marches about a 9-11 truth movement already happening in hundreds of cities, getting involved against the Patriot Act, getting involved against the toll roads.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.321]  Exactly.
[01:49:13.441 --> 01:49:14.762]  Everybody's got to be a leader.
[01:49:14.822 --> 01:49:16.303]  It is not about Alex Jones.
[01:49:17.083 --> 01:49:17.824]  I agree with that.
[01:49:17.984 --> 01:49:24.308]  So I wanted to touch on that, but originally why I was calling in is today in the Houston press I was reading an article that came out
[01:49:25.876 --> 01:49:27.877]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:49:27.997 --> 01:49:33.959]  We'll be right back after the quick break and let Bart finish up and we'll go to Fred, Roger and others.
[01:49:33.979 --> 01:49:34.679]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:34.699 --> 01:49:34.959]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:35.059 --> 01:49:36.180]  And hey, Ted.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:37.180]  Yes?
[01:49:37.380 --> 01:49:43.682]  I'm going to make you ride shotgun with me for a while.
[01:49:43.883 --> 01:49:44.483]  Alright, let's do it.
[01:49:44.503 --> 01:49:45.583]  You don't get to go eat lunch.
[01:49:45.943 --> 01:49:46.223]  Okay.
[01:49:46.343 --> 01:49:47.284]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:49:47.324 --> 01:49:47.704]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.797 --> 01:50:00.624]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.945 --> 01:50:02.326]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.526 --> 01:50:04.729]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.889 --> 01:50:06.971]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.251 --> 01:50:12.176]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.517 --> 01:50:16.561]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.801 --> 01:50:18.562]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.642 --> 01:50:29.289]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.449 --> 01:50:31.351]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.551 --> 01:50:33.592]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today.
[01:50:33.812 --> 01:50:34.452]  We're good to go.

[01:53:05.348 --> 01:53:13.333]  Frankly, not tootin' my own horn, one of the best tools we've found to wake people up are my hard-hitting, cutting-edge, hardcore, as they say, videos.

[01:53:49.886 --> 01:53:52.208]  Going back to Bart in Texas.
[01:53:52.268 --> 01:53:55.310]  Bart, you were mentioning something in the Houston News.
[01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:56.451]  What, the Houston Chronicle?
[01:53:57.332 --> 01:53:59.133]  No, this was in the Houston Post.
[01:53:59.974 --> 01:54:03.657]  And what it was reporting on, that's equivalent to the Austin Chronicle up there.
[01:54:03.677 --> 01:54:04.978]  Yeah, I got you, the weekly newspaper.
[01:54:05.038 --> 01:54:11.343]  But what it was reporting on was there was a girl in the Plains School District who had clinical depression.
[01:54:11.363 --> 01:54:13.145]  She gets prescribed medications.
[01:54:13.815 --> 01:54:18.116]  What she gets and her school district practices a zero tolerance policy.
[01:54:18.696 --> 01:54:22.257]  So what happens is that they do, you know, they find the drugs in her locker.
[01:54:22.297 --> 01:54:23.798]  It didn't specify how they did that.
[01:54:24.038 --> 01:54:25.038]  Yeah, they do searches.
[01:54:25.058 --> 01:54:25.938]  Yeah, it's a prison.
[01:54:26.399 --> 01:54:33.901]  Without reviewing her case, without notifying her parents, mandatory suspension, they send her to the juvenile detention facility.
[01:54:34.321 --> 01:54:41.703]  Now where this gets really dirty is the fact that this policy is pretty obviously fiscally motivated in the school district.
[01:54:42.116 --> 01:54:51.724]  Because as soon as they send that girl to the juvenile detention facility, because of this, they still receive the state funds, but the federal government picks up the tab.
[01:54:51.864 --> 01:54:55.687]  Now for those that don't understand, I'm not familiar with this case, but I've seen other similar ones.
[01:54:56.007 --> 01:55:06.695]  Children are sent to jail for one Tylenol, but she had prescribed drugs, and during the search they found the prescribed psychiatric drugs, and they went ahead and sent her to juvenile hall.
[01:55:06.715 --> 01:55:08.717]  And they won't even review the case.
[01:55:09.093 --> 01:55:10.633]  They won't even take a look at the case.
[01:55:10.654 --> 01:55:18.956]  They've acknowledged that it was prescribed that the head of the board that reviews the cases says, it's our policy not to overturn decisions we'll make.
[01:55:18.976 --> 01:55:24.998]  Yeah, so it's our policy if somebody, even if we find out they're not guilty, you still stay in it because we're all powerful and omnipresent.
[01:55:25.518 --> 01:55:27.139]  Email me that Houston Post article.
[01:55:27.179 --> 01:55:27.979]  I'd like to post that.
[01:55:28.519 --> 01:55:28.899]  Alrighty.
[01:55:29.259 --> 01:55:29.860]  Pun intended.
[01:55:31.607 --> 01:55:34.249]  And you know, again, this is just an example.
[01:55:34.269 --> 01:55:36.291]  These problems are everywhere.
[01:55:36.591 --> 01:55:41.676]  To think that you can get away from it, or that this isn't affecting you... Well, it's like the Valedictorian.
[01:55:41.756 --> 01:55:43.777]  It's like the Valedictorian on the last day of school.
[01:55:44.078 --> 01:55:58.070]  They're putting on a party in one of the classrooms, and she's bringing in her stuff, and then she's also moving out to go to college immediately, and there's silverware, a set of silverware her mother gave her, with knives, forks, spoons, and yes, six
[01:55:58.550 --> 01:56:01.371]  Well, I used to carry a buck knife on my side when I was in school and it just drives me nuts.
[01:56:01.391 --> 01:56:02.231]  I've got my kids in the schools and
[01:56:24.625 --> 01:56:27.967]  And, you know, if they even draw a picture of a gun, they can get in trouble.
[01:56:28.007 --> 01:56:31.649]  I mean, it's really gotten to, uh, it's gotten so out of hand.
[01:56:31.749 --> 01:56:41.274]  My dad would carry his shotgun on the school bus, and then go hunting with the coaches after school, and they'd all walk in on Fridays with their deer rifles and shotguns, and boy, it was the safest school on the planet!
[01:56:41.534 --> 01:56:47.437]  Well, I mean, what I have to say, Alex, if the teachers of Columbine were armed, how many kids would have been killed?
[01:56:48.618 --> 01:56:50.099]  My dad's not that old, Ted!
[01:56:50.934 --> 01:56:53.015]  I mean, this wasn't that long ago.
[01:56:53.035 --> 01:56:54.677]  It was in a pretty good-sized school district.
[01:56:54.897 --> 01:56:55.857]  Yeah, I know.
[01:56:56.078 --> 01:57:04.403]  But then you get people like Michael Moore, who did that bullying for Colin Bynum, and make such a big argument as to why guns should be taken away from people.
[01:57:04.843 --> 01:57:07.765]  And, you know, it's all a bunch of bull hunky, because, you know,
[01:57:10.227 --> 01:57:16.790]  Because we've become so disarmed, people were able to use box cutters to hijack airplanes.
[01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:18.771]  Do you believe the official story?
[01:57:18.911 --> 01:57:20.912]  I'll let y'all go, but this is not freedom.
[01:57:20.972 --> 01:57:26.255]  What we're dealing with, and what's being shoved down our throat by these bureaucracies, is not freedom.
[01:57:26.355 --> 01:57:29.697]  And it has nothing to do with terrorism.
[01:57:29.717 --> 01:57:30.297]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:30.357 --> 01:57:30.857]  Good points.
[01:57:31.317 --> 01:57:32.698]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:57:32.718 --> 01:57:35.880]  And Ted Wheelby will be with us for a couple more segments.
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:37.060]  We'll continue to take your calls.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.321]  We're going to do a bunch of other news.
[01:57:39.513 --> 01:57:39.794]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:50.063 --> 01:57:50.703]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.364 --> 01:57:52.445]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.145 --> 01:57:54.246]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.887 --> 01:57:55.727]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.468 --> 01:57:57.409]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.049 --> 01:58:01.713]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.213 --> 01:58:06.337]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.865 --> 01:58:14.828]  Alright my friends, now into hour number three on this October 7, 2004 live Thursday edition.
[01:58:15.509 --> 01:58:35.818]  This broadcast goes out worldwide Monday through Friday from 11am until 2pm Central Standard Time, not just on the AM and FM dial, but Global Shortwave at 94.75 and at night, back from 9 to midnight at 32.10 and of course Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv fighting the Earth being turned into a prison planet
[01:58:36.423 --> 01:58:39.167]  Well, we have a website, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:40.288 --> 01:58:47.577]  We're not going to let this country, this nation, this planet be turned into a control grid, though it is unfolding.
[01:58:48.358 --> 01:58:50.781]  We've got, of course, loaded phone lines here, a ton of news.
[01:58:50.821 --> 01:58:54.766]  I want to get into how Kerry speaks out against Bush on human rights and all this stuff, but
[01:58:55.473 --> 01:58:57.575]  He's on the vanguard of pushing all of it.
[01:58:57.595 --> 01:58:58.956]  They're identical on their policies.
[01:58:59.516 --> 01:59:03.079]  I want to get into new admissions of how the whole country will be a giant toll road.
[01:59:03.139 --> 01:59:05.180]  More new developments on this as they announce it.
[01:59:05.521 --> 01:59:07.502]  But we've known about three years, now becoming public.
[01:59:08.183 --> 01:59:18.270]  And Ted Anderson, the owner of Genesis, never really had him on, haven't had him on in about six months, he's riding shotgun with us for a couple more segments as we sit here and take phone calls.
[01:59:18.630 --> 01:59:21.252]  Right now, let's talk to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[01:59:21.633 --> 01:59:22.473]  Fred, you're on the air.
[01:59:22.513 --> 01:59:22.974]  Go ahead.
[01:59:22.994 --> 01:59:24.034]  Hello, Alex.
[01:59:25.923 --> 01:59:51.068]  Calling from the Cradle of Liberty and last night I felt as though I didn't have any liberty because when I was going home last night from downtown Philadelphia I just decided to walk past the Liberty Bell and nothing earth shattering happened but I just didn't like seeing all the cops around there.
[01:59:51.088 --> 01:59:54.649]  I felt as though they had ruined the whole experience.
[01:59:56.679 --> 02:00:02.903]  Well, that's what it's all about, is this overall feeling of oppression and intimidation.
[02:00:02.943 --> 02:00:04.124]  It's not about security.
[02:00:04.864 --> 02:00:12.789]  Well, you know, you add in the whole New World Order thing, and you're talking about welfare and what's happened in the United States.
[02:00:12.849 --> 02:00:15.031]  I mean, you wouldn't have seen this in the 1950s.
[02:00:15.631 --> 02:00:21.295]  But because of the fact that we've degraded society into believing that the government should take care of us,
[02:00:21.975 --> 02:00:31.082]  And we've gone into such high crime and then you add the police and it's become such an entangled mess and it's all about control.
[02:00:31.562 --> 02:00:39.568]  The further down the road that the United States citizens go down this direction, the more they give away their freedoms and their liberty.
[02:00:40.509 --> 02:00:43.050]  I want to ask something else.
[02:00:43.771 --> 02:00:50.616]  Is GCN going to stay on this, what I think is a very good model of mass communication, shortwave is?
[02:00:51.297 --> 02:00:55.720]  Yes, but what I'm saying is, will you be able to survive if there's some sort of mandate to go to digital
[02:01:16.300 --> 02:01:17.380]  Broadcasting.
[02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:24.783]  Well that's the receivers that do that and then they just shift over to the receivers and broadcast this program on digital.
[02:01:24.943 --> 02:01:27.063]  And maybe I can help with that a little bit Alex.
[02:01:27.083 --> 02:01:41.628]  You know there is a technological shift going toward digital in the satellite industry and the reason why they're doing that is because it takes less bandwidth on the satellite to send a digital signal than it does to take an analog signal.
[02:01:41.648 --> 02:01:43.068]  The same thing happened to cell phones.
[02:01:44.274 --> 02:01:58.666]  Because of the fact that it's less bandwidth, it's less expensive to the people that are trying to put the message out, and the television signals have been going toward the digital feeds, like you've seen here not too lately with gospel music television.
[02:01:58.686 --> 02:02:02.149]  That's one of the reasons why we had to move away from it, is because they went digital.
[02:02:03.571 --> 02:02:09.453]  The internet has sort of taken that over because of the internet being so cheap and the bandwidth dropping there.
[02:02:10.333 --> 02:02:15.035]  And to be able to listen to that digital feed is becoming less and less expensive in the future.
[02:02:15.075 --> 02:02:18.816]  So I'm not sure if satellite's going to be the thing in the future anyways.
[02:02:18.876 --> 02:02:28.919]  Ted, I'm saying is don't you think that it would be possible, unfortunately, that software will be required and then the freedom... Well, you're talking about transmitters.
[02:02:28.959 --> 02:02:30.460]  We're not on the transmission end.
[02:02:31.642 --> 02:02:34.584]  I just hope that the government doesn't interfere with the good thing.
[02:02:34.624 --> 02:02:35.225]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:02:35.365 --> 02:02:36.446]  Well, they're already doing it.
[02:02:36.666 --> 02:02:38.568]  All radio will be digital within five years.
[02:02:38.648 --> 02:02:39.749]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:02:40.129 --> 02:02:40.570]  Stay with us.
[02:02:47.995 --> 02:02:53.477]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.897 --> 02:02:58.138]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.358 --> 02:03:05.400]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.780 --> 02:03:11.902]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.922 --> 02:03:13.242]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.582 --> 02:03:16.546]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.686 --> 02:03:18.628]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:19.029 --> 02:03:26.277]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.558 --> 02:03:29.942]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:03:46.818 --> 02:03:51.322]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.662 --> 02:03:55.746]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:56.046 --> 02:03:56.586]  We listened.
[02:03:56.907 --> 02:04:01.891]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:02.171 --> 02:04:02.651]  We listened.
[02:04:03.032 --> 02:04:06.074]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.495 --> 02:04:07.035]  We listened.
[02:04:07.495 --> 02:04:10.538]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:04:10.538 --> 02:04:11.178]  We're good to go.
[02:04:36.218 --> 02:04:38.360]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:04:49.574 --> 02:04:50.875]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:04:51.075 --> 02:04:56.818]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:04:57.078 --> 02:05:02.321]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:05:02.641 --> 02:05:06.743]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:05:06.943 --> 02:05:10.727]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:05:10.988 --> 02:05:15.633]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:05:15.733 --> 02:05:18.496]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:05:18.796 --> 02:05:21.980]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:05:22.040 --> 02:05:23.862]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:05:42.066 --> 02:05:44.246]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:05:50.067 --> 02:05:50.708]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.388 --> 02:05:52.368]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.141 --> 02:05:54.242]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.903 --> 02:05:55.744]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.485 --> 02:05:57.365]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.385 --> 02:06:01.670]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.230 --> 02:06:06.374]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.996 --> 02:06:10.599]  Well, we got the big cheese, the big boss on with us.
[02:06:11.199 --> 02:06:13.642]  Ted Anderson got him right to shotgun with us today.
[02:06:14.716 --> 02:06:19.699]  Came on to talk about a free Bob Chapman newsletter offer, and I just asked him to stay with us a little bit longer.
[02:06:19.799 --> 02:06:20.940]  It's fun having him on with us.
[02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:22.761]  Hey, Chad, let me throw this out at you.
[02:06:22.781 --> 02:06:36.390]  I'm sure you've heard that if you want to work in the Mexican Ministry of Justice, you've got to have an implantable chip now, and now they're talking about making all their Federali police have it, and to get in the VIP nightclubs in Europe now, you've got to have the chip, and they're talking about making, quote, all the criminals take the chip.
[02:06:37.133 --> 02:06:39.997]  Remember me talking about microchips five, six, seven years ago?
[02:06:40.037 --> 02:06:40.858]  Sounded pretty kooky?
[02:06:41.018 --> 02:06:43.642]  Yeah, kooky and it was only going to happen to animals.
[02:06:44.002 --> 02:06:47.827]  Yeah, and so now though, it's oh, it's for our safety.
[02:06:48.508 --> 02:06:51.893]  What do you think about now to the point of where they're telling us we all need microchips?
[02:06:52.353 --> 02:06:58.440]  Well, I'm sure it's going to be a requirement when every baby is born that they get their chip right away, just like they get their birth certificate.
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:12.695]  I mean, people get used to these things, and it really is... That's what bothers me about it mostly, Alex, is that as the generations progress on, people get more accustomed to being subject to these things where you would have just...
[02:07:13.275 --> 02:07:20.321]  You know, you would have absolutely not have done this 10 years ago, and now people are even, you know, they're doing it to get into nightclubs, for goodness sakes.
[02:07:20.441 --> 02:07:35.594]  Well, look, it's even happened to me, to where I sit here and I cover news, where, here's the Army plan, they're gonna push chips on us, and then it happens, and then, oh, it's just for the criminals, and just for the, and then, oh, now they want it for everybody, and then it's, we all just get conditioned, used to hearing about it,
[02:07:36.214 --> 02:07:39.258]  And we've got to consciously say no to this and realize how bad it is.
[02:07:39.298 --> 02:07:45.906]  It's like, first we learned two or three years ago they were putting cameras not just in the school classrooms or halls, but now in their bathrooms.
[02:07:45.966 --> 02:07:55.457]  And kids from visiting teams would come to the locker room and see a camera in the shower and the girl would, 11-year-old, would run out screaming and then the principal on the news said, what's the big deal?
[02:07:56.218 --> 02:07:58.139]  Don't want bad things to happen in the bathrooms.
[02:07:58.199 --> 02:07:59.539]  We have cameras in the locker room.
[02:07:59.819 --> 02:08:05.981]  Then, two weeks ago, up in Pennsylvania, a big police department put up cameras in the showers of the police.
[02:08:06.021 --> 02:08:07.281]  Well, we have to watch them.
[02:08:07.301 --> 02:08:08.542]  You know, even the cops.
[02:08:08.722 --> 02:08:12.623]  I mean, it's just, folks, cameras in the bathroom is Orwellian!
[02:08:12.703 --> 02:08:13.943]  It's past Orwellian!
[02:08:14.283 --> 02:08:16.264]  I mean, that is as big brother as it gets!
[02:08:16.886 --> 02:08:18.647]  Did you hear that newscast I played?
[02:08:18.687 --> 02:08:22.190]  It was a local newscast where they said that mercury is now nutritious?
[02:08:22.270 --> 02:08:23.571]  Yeah, isn't that crazy?
[02:08:24.372 --> 02:08:25.413]  In fact, cue that up again.
[02:08:25.453 --> 02:08:26.293]  Folks, don't believe this.
[02:08:26.594 --> 02:08:27.574]  It was a federal report.
[02:08:27.815 --> 02:08:35.901]  They did this study, and the study said, well, our study, paid for by Big Pharma that puts in the vaccines, says that it's actually good for your brain.
[02:08:36.716 --> 02:08:40.698]  Folks, everybody knows high levels of mercury are bad for your brain and that's what's in it.
[02:08:41.038 --> 02:08:43.400]  I mean, you know, we're not radical here.
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:45.561]  We're just saying no to this stuff.
[02:08:45.741 --> 02:08:46.881]  Did you find that clip, John?
[02:08:46.901 --> 02:08:49.783]  Alright, he's digging it out of the computer.
[02:08:49.803 --> 02:08:50.763]  We've got hundreds of clips in there.
[02:08:50.783 --> 02:08:52.164]  We'll take a call and we'll go to that clip.
[02:08:52.924 --> 02:08:55.366]  Let's talk to Fred in Pennsylvania.
[02:08:55.426 --> 02:08:56.146]  Fred, you're on the air.
[02:08:56.186 --> 02:08:56.546]  Go ahead.
[02:08:58.453 --> 02:08:59.674]  Okay, Roger in Pennsylvania.
[02:08:59.694 --> 02:09:00.054]  Go ahead.
[02:09:00.074 --> 02:09:00.594]  Hi, Roger.
[02:09:00.854 --> 02:09:01.975]  Yeah, thanks, Jens.
[02:09:02.055 --> 02:09:03.876]  Yeah, what did Barney Feist say?
[02:09:03.916 --> 02:09:04.816]  We've got to nip it in the bud.
[02:09:04.956 --> 02:09:11.319]  Oh, and before that, I just... No, I can understand, Ted, from the content provider standpoint, it helps consolidate your cost, of course.
[02:09:12.757 --> 02:09:13.998]  Nobody knows what you're talking about.
[02:09:14.018 --> 02:09:14.739]  We've got a caller.
[02:09:14.879 --> 02:09:15.459]  Stop right there.
[02:09:15.599 --> 02:09:16.741]  Yeah, from the media.
[02:09:16.781 --> 02:09:17.762]  Stop for a second, Roger.
[02:09:18.262 --> 02:09:20.484]  We can talk about technical stuff all day if you guys want to.
[02:09:20.764 --> 02:09:31.475]  For those that don't know what we're talking about, who just tuned in, five minutes ago a caller said, what does radio going to digital mean for these shows?
[02:09:31.915 --> 02:09:33.637]  Are you going to keep it on shortwave?
[02:09:34.286 --> 02:09:37.908]  There's not going to be a law that you can't broadcast in analog.
[02:09:38.268 --> 02:09:47.873]  It's just they're going to make, within the next few years, all of AM and FM, UHF, VHF, TV radio, also simulcast in digital.
[02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:49.334]  So they are facing it out.
[02:09:50.194 --> 02:09:59.179]  We already have digital and non-digital satellites, so we can already provide any radio station with what they want and what they need.
[02:09:59.239 --> 02:10:01.100]  Now go ahead and talk about your technical thing.
[02:10:01.576 --> 02:10:11.650]  Yeah, it's really a quite different problem because there's no real expense for the broadcaster to download the digital stream.
[02:10:12.190 --> 02:10:19.180]  The problem is, of course, they're basically trying to lock out the little guy broadcasters who sometimes, like the TV especially, they have to
[02:10:20.273 --> 02:10:26.818]  I tell you what I think is even more important than what we're talking about here is that, and we got a link on GCNlive.com to downsize DC.
[02:10:50.033 --> 02:11:00.261]  And there's that new legislation coming out because of Howard Stern and his vulgarity.
[02:11:00.741 --> 02:11:05.825]  But you've got to realize they can use the same law on Alex Jones and say you can't speak up against the government.
[02:11:07.566 --> 02:11:12.027]  So it's really violating the First Amendment, and you know, obviously that's a really important thing.
[02:11:12.067 --> 02:11:13.027]  Yeah, it's a pretext.
[02:11:13.067 --> 02:11:21.369]  I mean, the stuff on TV now is far worse, frankly, in many cases, than Stern, but it's all selectively enforced, and there's all this draconian control.
[02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:22.789]  Roger, I got loaded phones here.
[02:11:22.809 --> 02:11:23.389]  You got anything else?
[02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:26.250]  Yeah, yeah, well, yeah, I did have a banking thing.
[02:11:26.410 --> 02:11:30.471]  I didn't want the previous caller or anyone else to confuse the two unrelated issues.
[02:11:30.911 --> 02:11:34.893]  Nor to ignore the one about forcing transmission only in digital mode.
[02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:36.474]  Again, we're not involved in that.
[02:11:36.675 --> 02:11:36.855]  Yes.
[02:11:36.975 --> 02:11:38.235]  Hey, okay, I'm banking.
[02:11:38.275 --> 02:11:40.917]  There's a real nip it in the bud, Barney, if I said thing here.
[02:11:41.437 --> 02:11:54.165]  Where, and this only got scant mention, and I checked this over the last couple months, now it's only maybe slightly less than half of the major banks, and none of the smaller ones are forcing fingerprinting.
[02:11:54.185 --> 02:11:59.368]  In other words, you write a check drawn on your bank, to me, I take the check to your bank,
[02:12:00.054 --> 02:12:00.614]  I don't know.
[02:12:21.141 --> 02:12:24.483]  They're forcing fingerprinting if I take a check that you wrote.
[02:12:24.503 --> 02:12:25.543]  Yes, I understand that part.
[02:12:26.024 --> 02:12:27.685]  So you're saying dump the banks.
[02:12:28.145 --> 02:12:32.047]  Just get out of that particular bank so you don't have to, so you don't support the scam.
[02:12:32.327 --> 02:12:37.290]  And ask your employers to pick different banks if you're taking your paycheck and they want you to fingerprint it.
[02:12:37.930 --> 02:12:46.295]  Tell them that's intolerable and your employer pick another bank because if we don't, and those fingerprints stick around forever in those databases.
[02:12:46.415 --> 02:12:48.256]  No matter what that teller tells you,
[02:12:48.803 --> 02:12:51.565]  They're speaking past their knowledge when they say otherwise.
[02:12:51.945 --> 02:12:52.426]  I understand.
[02:12:52.466 --> 02:12:53.146]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:53.567 --> 02:12:56.409]  No, it's all getting you trained for the biometrics, folks.
[02:12:57.330 --> 02:12:58.951]  And it's not speaking past their knowledge.
[02:12:58.991 --> 02:13:03.635]  The biometric industry puts out this same line that, well, the digital fingerprint isn't a fingerprint.
[02:13:03.655 --> 02:13:04.575]  It's zeros and ones.
[02:13:04.875 --> 02:13:07.538]  Well, so is a digital photo of you and your kids at the beach.
[02:13:08.118 --> 02:13:10.360]  But it's reconfigured for the image of the fingerprint.
[02:13:10.380 --> 02:13:13.182]  I mean, it's just, it's incredible lying is what it is.
[02:13:13.963 --> 02:13:15.644]  Let's talk to Wes in Florida.
[02:13:15.684 --> 02:13:16.545]  Thanks for holding, Wes.
[02:13:16.565 --> 02:13:16.985]  Go ahead.
[02:13:19.181 --> 02:13:20.703]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[02:13:21.023 --> 02:13:21.543]  Welcome.
[02:13:21.964 --> 02:13:26.647]  Just wanted to say thank you so much to you and Ted for GCN and for the show you're putting out there.
[02:13:28.108 --> 02:13:32.812]  I've kind of fallen asleep on the whole political and what was going on in the world until September 11th.
[02:13:32.872 --> 02:13:35.774]  I was once kind of active and just kind of got burnt out.
[02:13:36.315 --> 02:13:38.837]  And thank you guys after September 11th and waking up.
[02:13:39.217 --> 02:13:43.420]  Down here in Florida where we just had the storm and I've never seen anything like it.
[02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:48.264]  There were, I guess for our peace and safety, there were National Guard everywhere.
[02:13:49.088 --> 02:13:57.640]  And it was quite an experience, Alex, to actually drive down the streets where we live and work and see armed guards for our safety directing traffic.
[02:13:58.782 --> 02:13:59.483]  It was pretty wild.
[02:13:59.523 --> 02:14:03.068]  I talked to some family members and asked them how that affected them, and they all just kind of blew it off.
[02:14:03.188 --> 02:14:04.730]  I said, don't you realize that that's kind of...
[02:14:05.828 --> 02:14:07.349]  A little more than necessary?
[02:14:07.609 --> 02:14:12.132]  Well, I mean, they do urban warfare drills in almost every city condition, and so there's no hurricane.
[02:14:12.392 --> 02:14:14.573]  They openly say they're getting rid of Posse Comitatus.
[02:14:14.854 --> 02:14:23.599]  They extended curfews illegally, weren't even official curfews, that it expired, and they were still arresting people when there was no problem.
[02:14:23.859 --> 02:14:29.703]  It's part of this overusing the authority, or it's kind of this oppressive authority, to train us how to be good little slaves.
[02:14:30.478 --> 02:14:32.199]  Yeah, there were a couple things I just wanted to mention.
[02:14:32.279 --> 02:14:33.719]  One was, I thought it was really ironic.
[02:14:33.759 --> 02:14:44.383]  I had a reporter here locally, I actually asked a local official at a press conference, you know, do the National Guardsmen have the power and the authority to act as a policeman on the street?
[02:14:44.563 --> 02:14:46.064]  And he said, yes, they have full authority.
[02:14:46.484 --> 02:14:49.305]  And the reporter started to ask, isn't that a problem?
[02:14:49.405 --> 02:14:51.226]  And then they cut him off and went to the next person.
[02:14:52.106 --> 02:14:53.446]  Just totally went over that question.
[02:14:53.506 --> 02:14:56.688]  It was just basically like, oh, yeah, posse comitatus, we don't, we ignore that now.
[02:14:56.768 --> 02:14:57.588]  It's a disaster.
[02:14:58.517 --> 02:15:03.840]  Well, look, they've said they want to get rid of it, period, and have troops permanently stationed on all our streets, thanks for the call.
[02:15:04.340 --> 02:15:05.401]  And they've got to have something to do.
[02:15:05.441 --> 02:15:11.043]  There's no real terrorists to go after, so all of your misdemeanor activities are now going to be listed as terrorist activities.
[02:15:11.864 --> 02:15:15.646]  Ted, before you leave us, I'm going to come back and cover news and go to more calls.
[02:15:16.186 --> 02:15:24.370]  Now, you're offering a free, the latest issue of Bob Chapman's Incredible International Forecaster newsletter, also two silver dollars.
[02:15:25.693 --> 02:15:27.694]  And a Citizen Rulebook for $24.95.
[02:15:27.894 --> 02:15:29.194]  That's a great deal.
[02:15:29.554 --> 02:15:35.176]  Citizen Rulebook has the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, famous quotes, what the juries are really supposed to be.
[02:15:35.636 --> 02:15:36.516]  Great little booklet.
[02:15:36.916 --> 02:15:38.577]  Also with two silver dollars for $24.95.
[02:15:39.657 --> 02:15:44.799]  And you have those $10 Liberties, a semi-numismatic coin, for a very good price.
[02:15:44.819 --> 02:15:47.359]  You can buy them individually or in rolls of ten.
[02:15:47.900 --> 02:15:49.280]  Tell folks about that special deal.
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:53.841]  Well, of course, they're $275 a coin, and once again, Alex, I think it's just a great deal.
[02:15:54.001 --> 02:16:08.745]  I mean, $10 Liberties have been trading in the $300 range here recently, and at $275, that's a real good value, and it's something that you can put your money into, and just know that you're going to have something that will be worth something in the future.
[02:16:08.945 --> 02:16:11.905]  Give them a call, 1-800-686-2237, 1-800-686-2237, or get one of the free Bob Chapman newsletters
[02:16:18.967 --> 02:16:22.249]  Or get one of the Silver Dollar Citizen Rulebook packages.
[02:16:23.269 --> 02:16:29.632]  And again, this is Ted Anderson, who owns Genesis and owns Midas, and Midas supports Genesis.
[02:16:29.652 --> 02:16:30.092]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:16:30.412 --> 02:16:33.373]  Ted, thanks a lot for coming on.
[02:16:33.393 --> 02:16:34.293]  Any closing comments?
[02:16:34.774 --> 02:16:41.416]  Yeah, I just gotta say that I just think it's so great that you're carrying on this message, and you take a look at this political race, and what do you want?
[02:16:41.436 --> 02:16:45.078]  Do you want Democrat New World Order, or would you like to have Republican New World Order?
[02:16:45.678 --> 02:17:14.589]  I mean it's just you there's no choices in this world and until people wake up and start listening to shows like this and watching your videos and that kind of thing making copies getting it out there I mean that's what's making the difference out there in this world and people are actually turning around and mentioning Alex Jones on major market shows like Rush Limbaugh and Art Bell's show which is George Norrie now I mean you hear this stuff now and five ten years ago when we got started at this Alex you know they wouldn't even let us close
[02:17:15.229 --> 02:17:22.372]  And all of a sudden now people across the entire United States are familiar with what you are about, what your videos are about.
[02:17:22.392 --> 02:17:26.453]  Well, I want to thank you for providing the platform, Ted, and never once censoring me.
[02:17:26.934 --> 02:17:29.134]  And yeah, just using my name as a gauge.
[02:17:29.575 --> 02:17:30.555]  It's all over the place.
[02:17:31.295 --> 02:17:33.796]  And we are forcing it into the mainstream.
[02:17:33.816 --> 02:17:37.978]  We've documented our claims, regardless of how crazy they sound.
[02:17:38.238 --> 02:17:39.238]  The New World Order is here.
[02:17:39.298 --> 02:17:40.079]  It's out in the open.
[02:17:40.339 --> 02:17:41.619]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:17:41.999 --> 02:17:42.700]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:43.580]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.777 --> 02:17:48.799]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:17:48.819 --> 02:17:51.701]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[02:17:51.922 --> 02:17:59.027]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:17:59.207 --> 02:18:04.771]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:12.937]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:18:13.177 --> 02:18:14.458]  Either way, why chance it?

[02:19:45.231 --> 02:19:49.134]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:49.354 --> 02:20:01.644]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:02.064 --> 02:20:02.464]  The U.S.
[02:20:02.504 --> 02:20:08.109]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:08.489 --> 02:20:10.711]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:12.552 --> 02:20:13.633]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:20:13.653 --> 02:20:16.515]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:20:16.615 --> 02:20:22.639]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:20:23.059 --> 02:20:26.421]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[02:21:48.226 --> 02:21:54.252]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.853 --> 02:21:57.856]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.539 --> 02:22:02.341]  That's a great price on that $10 gold piece.
[02:22:04.486 --> 02:22:07.390]  And it's a really great price on that free Bob Chapman newsletter.
[02:22:07.410 --> 02:22:08.431]  This is powerful stuff.
[02:22:09.172 --> 02:22:09.853]  Give him a call.
[02:22:09.873 --> 02:22:10.514]  800-686-2237.
[02:22:11.435 --> 02:22:14.840]  If you missed that number, I kind of said it real quick.
[02:22:14.880 --> 02:22:16.322]  Folks are calling up asking what it was.
[02:22:16.342 --> 02:22:16.402]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:22.061 --> 02:22:26.602]  I'm going to go to Chris, and Chris, and Chris, and Chris, and James, and everybody else.
[02:22:26.622 --> 02:22:31.003]  One time I had five marks on a line, but that was our record.
[02:22:31.043 --> 02:22:32.723]  We got a whole bunch of Chrises.
[02:22:32.743 --> 02:22:36.624]  We'll get to all the Chrises coming up here in a few minutes, but let me go through some more news here.
[02:22:37.644 --> 02:22:44.686]  Reason Magazine, which I wouldn't call liberal or conservative, it's kind of libertarian liberally in a way,
[02:22:45.723 --> 02:22:48.827]  But it says, John Kerry's dark record on civil liberties.
[02:22:48.867 --> 02:22:51.790]  The Democratic candidate is no friend of the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:52.731 --> 02:22:53.873]  And I read this last night.
[02:22:53.913 --> 02:22:55.114]  It's 14 pages long.
[02:22:55.214 --> 02:22:56.636]  Obviously I can't read it all.
[02:22:57.177 --> 02:23:02.343]  But it really documents how scary John Kerry is.
[02:23:02.923 --> 02:23:03.824]  Scary Kerry.
[02:23:04.525 --> 02:23:05.847]  And how he's a total hypocrite.
[02:23:07.088 --> 02:23:10.630]  And if another Democrat tells me, we gotta vote for Kerry!
[02:23:10.930 --> 02:23:13.572]  He's so good on the Civil Liberties!
[02:23:13.612 --> 02:23:15.613]  I mean, I'm gonna slap you upside the head!
[02:23:16.114 --> 02:23:16.754]  I'm sorry!
[02:23:18.235 --> 02:23:24.419]  For John Kerry, the specter of Attorney General John Ashcroft, trashing American Civil Liberties has been a useful campaign prop.
[02:23:24.779 --> 02:23:32.784]  And Campaign Stops Kerry has promised to end the era of John Ashcroft and review the administration.
[02:23:34.602 --> 02:23:37.065]  And renew our faith in the Constitution, said Kerry.
[02:23:37.425 --> 02:23:42.371]  Administration, he promised, the liberal group move on last year.
[02:23:42.491 --> 02:23:45.495]  Quote, there will be no John Ashcroft trampling on the Bill of Rights.
[02:23:46.255 --> 02:23:55.346]  In his 2004 campaign book, A Call to Service, Kerry accused Ashcroft and the Bush Administration of relying far too much on extraordinary police powers.
[02:23:56.201 --> 02:24:05.529]  In contrast, Kerry positions himself as a civil libertarian, or at least as a proponent of reasonable balance between liberty and security.
[02:24:05.709 --> 02:24:08.732]  We are to stand as the world's role model for freedom.
[02:24:08.772 --> 02:24:13.296]  We need to remain vigilant about our civil liberties, Kerry writes in a call to service.
[02:24:13.336 --> 02:24:17.359]  He calls for rededicating ourselves to protecting civil liberties.
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:19.982]  But then they
[02:24:20.791 --> 02:24:22.752]  Get into his actual votes.
[02:24:23.012 --> 02:24:32.278]  He has one of the worst records in the Senate when it comes to Patriot Act type laws and legislation in the police state.
[02:24:34.099 --> 02:24:38.222]  And it goes on to say, this is the first time Kerry and Ashcroft have been at odds over civil liberties.
[02:24:38.242 --> 02:24:43.946]  In the late 1990s, government proposals for strict encryption inspired a national debate.
[02:24:44.066 --> 02:24:45.847]  Then as now the American Civil Liberties Union
[02:24:46.474 --> 02:24:51.718]  And Electronic Privacy Groups locked horns with the DOJ and law enforcement agencies.
[02:24:52.339 --> 02:24:56.042]  Then as now, Kerry and Ashcroft were on opposites.
[02:24:56.727 --> 02:25:04.150]  But there was a noteworthy difference in those days, and Ron Paul actually talked about this in a speech he gave, and it's in my film, The Matrix of Evil.
[02:25:04.751 --> 02:25:14.355]  Then it was Senator John Ashcroft, Republican, Missouri, who argued alongside the ACLU in favor of the individual's right to encrypt messages and export encryption software.
[02:25:14.755 --> 02:25:23.779]  Ashcroft was kind of the go-to guy for all of us on the Republican side of the Senate, recalls David Sobel, General Counsel of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
[02:25:24.403 --> 02:25:34.706]  And there was a bunch of other legislation that Janet Reno and spearheaded in the Senate by Kerry, where they wanted to track all your emails and read what you're doing and get rid of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:25:35.066 --> 02:25:41.188]  And it was John Ashcroft giving these quotes about how this is pure evil and wrong and destroys what America's all about.
[02:25:43.314 --> 02:25:45.955]  Whereas Ascroft used to really be for civil liberties.
[02:25:45.975 --> 02:25:46.775]  I mean, he really was.
[02:25:47.015 --> 02:25:48.555]  And what I call God-given rights.
[02:25:49.155 --> 02:25:50.955]  Civil liberties are 14th Amendment, folks.
[02:25:50.996 --> 02:25:51.936]  That can be taken away.
[02:25:51.996 --> 02:25:53.076]  It's a privilege on a right.
[02:25:53.556 --> 02:26:01.257]  So I'm into those God-given type of rights, not the civil liberties of the civil government and rewards of the state.
[02:26:01.277 --> 02:26:08.839]  But then Ascroft shifted into total police state and passed Patriot Act 1 that was a bundle of laws that Democrats had tried to pass in the past.
[02:26:09.480 --> 02:26:24.884]  So I'm not going to sit here and watch the Democrats run around and act like, and it's a 14-page article, I don't have time to cover it all, but it just goes on for page after page of all the horrible things that Kerry has done and tried to do.
[02:26:25.424 --> 02:26:26.504]  And I'm not for Bush either.
[02:26:26.984 --> 02:26:31.825]  I'm just pointing out that this is pretty ridiculous, is the bottom line.
[02:26:32.245 --> 02:26:34.066]  I mean, Kerry's for national ID cards.
[02:26:34.787 --> 02:26:35.748]  So's John McCain.
[02:26:35.828 --> 02:26:37.369]  Kerry's for a Patriot Act, too.
[02:26:38.089 --> 02:26:39.110]  So's George Bush.
[02:26:39.150 --> 02:26:40.571]  I mean, it's just a joke!
[02:26:41.211 --> 02:26:48.236]  I'm just sick of Democrats emailing me and calling me and, you know, Alex, you're right about Bush being bad, but why do you say Kerry's bad?
[02:26:50.237 --> 02:26:50.937]  It's a joke.
[02:26:51.698 --> 02:26:59.803]  The only reason I think Kerry might be better for President is because he's so evil and so bad that Republicans will wake up to his agenda.
[02:27:01.152 --> 02:27:05.755]  And the agenda George Bush has been passing, but suddenly they'll be against it because it's a Democrat in there.
[02:27:06.515 --> 02:27:12.979]  That's why I think the Globalists are going to leave George in office, because he's been such an effective Trojan horse.
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:16.001]  But again, it doesn't matter, folks.
[02:27:16.601 --> 02:27:24.766]  Whether it's John Kerry or George Bush, the borders stay wide open, the export of jobs accelerates, no matter how many speeches John Edwards gives to the contrary.
[02:27:25.146 --> 02:27:27.868]  The actions speak a lot louder than words.
[02:27:28.598 --> 02:27:30.919]  We'll come back, take more calls, get into more news.
[02:27:31.460 --> 02:27:33.001]  PrisonPlanet.tv, folks.
[02:27:33.041 --> 02:27:33.541]  Check it out!
[02:27:36.023 --> 02:27:36.943]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.404 --> 02:27:39.025]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.925 --> 02:27:42.627]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.064 --> 02:27:48.405]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.685 --> 02:27:52.505]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:27:52.826 --> 02:27:53.646]  Read the labels.
[02:27:54.086 --> 02:27:58.187]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:58.427 --> 02:28:02.608]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:02.988 --> 02:28:07.849]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:08.249 --> 02:28:11.831]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:12.012 --> 02:28:17.355]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[02:29:05.345 --> 02:29:06.606]  To below detectable levels.
[02:29:06.887 --> 02:29:10.831]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.

[02:29:42.668 --> 02:29:43.950]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:45.706 --> 02:29:47.187]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:29:47.387 --> 02:29:54.733]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:55.033 --> 02:29:59.456]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:29:59.716 --> 02:30:09.564]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:10.304 --> 02:30:13.965]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:30:14.325 --> 02:30:16.806]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:30:17.106 --> 02:30:23.008]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:30:23.268 --> 02:30:24.829]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.089 --> 02:30:25.990]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:29.051]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[02:30:33.493 --> 02:30:34.454]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:31:00.301 --> 02:31:06.302]  You know, I do this broadcast Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, and thank you so much for joining us.
[02:31:07.183 --> 02:31:09.763]  We cover a couple other news articles, and we'll go to all your calls.
[02:31:11.123 --> 02:31:14.224]  Casarillas says the New World Order is here to stay.
[02:31:14.264 --> 02:31:19.485]  That's the South Africa's intelligence minister, and he goes into how wonderful it is.
[02:31:19.545 --> 02:31:22.126]  It destabilizes things, but we still need the New World Order.
[02:31:22.146 --> 02:31:23.426]  That's out of the Mail and Guardian.
[02:31:24.249 --> 02:31:24.949]  Here's another one.
[02:31:24.989 --> 02:31:26.930]  Gorbachev calls for the New World Order.
[02:31:28.231 --> 02:31:29.812]  Called for this two days ago.
[02:31:29.892 --> 02:31:36.455]  Expresses concern about revival of nuclear arms race and need a New World Order to keep us all safe.
[02:31:36.515 --> 02:31:40.417]  See, that New World Order that doesn't exist and we're not supposed to talk about.
[02:31:42.298 --> 02:31:45.700]  Also, White House silent on Bremer troop request.
[02:31:46.080 --> 02:31:48.301]  Associated Press, the White House refused to say.
[02:31:49.392 --> 02:31:50.332]  Whether the top U.S.
[02:31:50.352 --> 02:32:08.119]  civilian official in Iraq after Saddam Hussein's ouster had asked the President for more troops to deal with the rapid descent of post-war Iraq into chaos, in remarks published Tuesday, the official, L. Paul Bremer, said he arrived in Iraq on May 6, 2003 to find horrid looting and a very unstable situation.
[02:32:09.151 --> 02:32:15.916]  Throwing new fuel onto the presidential campaign issue whether the United States has sufficiently planned for the post-war situation in Iraq.
[02:32:16.337 --> 02:32:20.600]  We paid a big price for not stopping it because it established an atmosphere of lawlessness.
[02:32:20.940 --> 02:32:28.746]  Burmer said during an address to the insurance group in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, the group released a summary of the remarks in Washington.
[02:32:29.167 --> 02:32:35.932]  We never had enough troops on the ground, Burmer said, while insisting that he was more convinced than ever that the regime change was the right thing to do.
[02:32:36.821 --> 02:32:38.702]  See, we've got to have that draft, folks.
[02:32:39.923 --> 02:32:40.784]  Very serious.
[02:32:40.804 --> 02:32:43.466]  I mean, the Secretary of the Army said 450,000 troops.
[02:32:43.986 --> 02:32:45.447]  They said, you're fired, it only takes 150,000.
[02:32:48.177 --> 02:32:48.777]  Four U.S.
[02:32:48.817 --> 02:32:59.423]  soldiers charged with murder, AP, four soldiers accused of smothering an Iraqi general during an interrogation last fall, have been charged with murder, bringing the total number of U.S.
[02:32:59.483 --> 02:33:02.164]  troops charged with murder in Iraq to at least 10.
[02:33:02.484 --> 02:33:04.365]  The soldiers could get life in prison without parole.
[02:33:04.385 --> 02:33:11.689]  Convicted of the November 26th death of Major General Abed Hamid Malhosh, 57, of Quaym, Iraq.
[02:33:11.729 --> 02:33:17.792]  The Army said that he died of asphyxiation from chest compression and from being smothered.
[02:33:18.959 --> 02:33:20.780]  Well, they were ordered to torture him, I mean.
[02:33:21.340 --> 02:33:24.361]  And again, the Iraqis are back because they torture, but we're good because we torture.
[02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:27.023]  And then they charge the troops who follow orders.
[02:33:27.323 --> 02:33:29.664]  Which I think they should charge them, but what about those who gave the orders?
[02:33:31.064 --> 02:33:33.105]  And that's all admitted.
[02:33:33.425 --> 02:33:42.950]  As usual, the UN's been involved in bribery all along in Iraq, and 60 billion UN oil for food program.
[02:33:42.970 --> 02:33:44.430]  It's just all a bunch of scamming.
[02:33:44.450 --> 02:33:45.951]  You've got Halliburton scamming now.
[02:33:46.011 --> 02:33:47.872]  It was the UN before.
[02:33:49.881 --> 02:33:52.083]  Very, very serious.
[02:33:52.703 --> 02:33:54.065]  But it's just part of the course.
[02:33:54.425 --> 02:33:57.427]  Kissinger defends South America politics, AP.
[02:33:58.588 --> 02:34:09.818]  Former Secretary of State Kissinger, defending his approach to Latin American dictatorships in the seventies, said Tuesday he proposedly steered clear of personal attacks when it came to condemning human rights abuses.
[02:34:10.298 --> 02:34:13.200]  Turns out he was the architect of mass murder all over the place down there.
[02:34:14.061 --> 02:34:15.943]  And he just says that
[02:34:17.598 --> 02:34:19.159]  He admits he objected to U.S.
[02:34:19.199 --> 02:34:21.901]  concerns of human rights, and he admits he just said, so what?
[02:34:22.041 --> 02:34:23.402]  I mean, the guy's just out in the open.
[02:34:24.963 --> 02:34:29.606]  Also, Asia-European leaders gather in Hanoi ahead of a summit.
[02:34:29.746 --> 02:34:37.951]  Asia and European leaders began arriving in Hanoi ahead of a summit aimed at boosting political, economic, and cultural ties despite profound inter-regional differences.
[02:34:38.883 --> 02:34:54.377]  And the French President, Jacques Chirac, was due to spearhead the European invasion later Wednesday with two days of bilateral meetings with Vietnamese leaders ahead of Friday's formal opening of the fifth Asian-Europe meeting.
[02:34:54.897 --> 02:34:55.898]  They call it invasion.
[02:34:55.918 --> 02:34:56.759]  I don't know what that means.
[02:34:57.646 --> 02:35:01.669]  All this globalization starting to merge and expand.
[02:35:02.209 --> 02:35:03.650]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[02:35:03.710 --> 02:35:06.231]  House votes to break up Ninth Circuit Court.
[02:35:06.652 --> 02:35:10.714]  Republican-led House voted Tuesday to break up the San Francisco-based Ninth U.S.
[02:35:10.734 --> 02:35:11.755]  Circuit Court of Appeals.
[02:35:12.115 --> 02:35:16.618]  An action opponent said was motivated by conservatives' ire over some of the court's rulings.
[02:35:17.498 --> 02:35:21.341]  Well, this Ninth Circuit's been ruling for Bush on the Patriot Act and stuff.
[02:35:23.596 --> 02:35:27.639]  It's mainly just political theater, folks, but the Ninth Circuit is atrocious.
[02:35:29.181 --> 02:35:32.043]  Iran's missiles can now hit Europe, ex-official says.
[02:35:32.383 --> 02:35:37.367]  This out of Reuters, Iran has increased the range of its missiles to 1,250 miles.
[02:35:37.747 --> 02:35:42.651]  A senior Iranian official was quoted as saying, putting parts of Europe within reach for the first time.
[02:35:42.691 --> 02:35:45.173]  Military analysts had estimated Iran's missile range was 810 miles.
[02:35:46.534 --> 02:36:03.046]  Which wouldn't allow it to strike anywhere in Israel, but Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Ali Akbar Hasim Rafjanjani, the country's influential former president, as the head of the government oversight body, is saying, now we have the power to launch a missile with a 2,000 kilometer range.
[02:36:03.506 --> 02:36:05.948]  Iran is determined to improve its military capabilities.
[02:36:06.508 --> 02:36:11.272]  And our government arms China, our government arms Pakistan, and then they openly arm Iran.
[02:36:11.292 --> 02:36:15.695]  They're trying to escalate this order out of chaos.
[02:36:18.178 --> 02:36:22.846]  Speaking of order out of chaos, this is out of the United States Defense Department website.
[02:36:22.866 --> 02:36:24.088]  DefenseLink.mil.
[02:36:24.549 --> 02:36:26.813]  Enemies of freedom use weapons of terror.
[02:36:26.933 --> 02:36:27.454]  Chaos!
[02:36:28.126 --> 02:36:32.529]  The enemies of freedom cannot defeat the coalition in a conventional war or in any battlefield.
[02:36:32.869 --> 02:36:37.212]  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld said in New York today, so they use weapons of terror and chaos.
[02:36:37.252 --> 02:36:45.578]  They want us to believe that the coalition cannot win, that a free Iraq and Afghan governments cannot win, that the fight is not worth it, that the effort will be too hard and too ugly.
[02:36:45.838 --> 02:36:48.720]  The Secretary said in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:36:49.901 --> 02:36:51.862]  Who really uses the order out of chaos?
[02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:53.624]  Who creates the terrorists, Rumsfeld?
[02:36:53.644 --> 02:36:55.225]  Can you answer that?
[02:36:56.283 --> 02:36:56.983]  Question for us.
[02:36:57.304 --> 02:37:04.788]  September, new numbers out for last month, is the second deadliest in 2004 in Iraq.
[02:37:05.088 --> 02:37:08.249]  September was the second deadliest month of the year for U.S.
[02:37:08.290 --> 02:37:14.853]  forces in Iraq and brought nearly to 500 the number who have died since the insurgency escalated late March.
[02:37:14.893 --> 02:37:23.438]  The Pentagon announced Sunday evening the two soldiers died late last week of injuries suffered earlier in the month and another was killed September 30th by a roadside bomb.
[02:37:23.698 --> 02:37:25.659]  That brought the month's death toll to
[02:37:27.259 --> 02:37:34.641]  And they say they need more troops, and they say no you don't.
[02:37:34.881 --> 02:37:36.641]  You just handle it yourselves.
[02:37:37.941 --> 02:37:43.002]  They claim everybody who's fighting our troops is an Al Qaeda member, and that's just not true, folks.
[02:37:45.183 --> 02:37:53.365]  The Shiites are against Al Qaeda, the Shiites were against Saddam, and they get their family members killed and then you make more insurgents, and a lot of officers have said that.
[02:37:53.405 --> 02:37:55.025]  It's just guerrilla warfare facts.
[02:37:55.777 --> 02:37:58.078]  And it's patriotic to tell the truth.
[02:37:59.139 --> 02:38:01.280]  There's an article here out of the feature.
[02:38:01.640 --> 02:38:13.227]  It says, Towards a Cashless Society, and it gets into how all these big businesses are shifting over to the cashless society through the radio frequency identification systems.
[02:38:14.348 --> 02:38:21.352]  Got a bunch of other news, but let's go ahead and get to some of your calls, and I'll go back over some of the top stories that a lot of you missed, if you didn't hear the first hour.
[02:38:21.972 --> 02:38:23.413]  Let's talk to Chris in Canada.
[02:38:23.433 --> 02:38:24.894]  Thanks for holding, Chris, you're on the air.
[02:38:25.720 --> 02:38:26.140]  Hi, Alex.
[02:38:26.341 --> 02:38:26.741]  Afternoon.
[02:38:27.161 --> 02:38:27.521]  Welcome.
[02:38:27.922 --> 02:38:28.022]  Hi.
[02:38:29.123 --> 02:38:39.591]  One thing that just came to mind while listening to your previous guest there, Ted Anderson, is another fella who deals in gold in his personal and private affairs.
[02:38:39.611 --> 02:38:40.852]  I think you've had him on before.
[02:38:41.432 --> 02:38:45.715]  And he also knows how to really use the law to his advantage and defend himself effectively.
[02:38:46.296 --> 02:38:48.037]  Are you talking about George Gordon?
[02:38:48.257 --> 02:38:48.618]  Oh, yeah.
[02:38:49.238 --> 02:38:49.618]  That's right.
[02:38:50.419 --> 02:38:50.859]  You are correct.
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:55.363]  I was thinking you could do like a gold show with Ted Anderson and George Gordon
[02:38:56.104 --> 02:39:01.347]  On simultaneously and then take calls, I think that would be a real storehouse of knowledge for your callers and listeners.
[02:39:01.367 --> 02:39:03.068]  You ought to have George Gordon back on.
[02:39:03.088 --> 02:39:06.630]  You know, he's won at the Supreme Court, won a lot of big district courts.
[02:39:06.690 --> 02:39:10.051]  He really knows the law and has an approach that is successful.
[02:39:10.371 --> 02:39:11.112]  Yeah, I agree.
[02:39:11.652 --> 02:39:20.777]  He claims, well he states, and I believe him, because he's authentic and you can check it out for yourself, it's all a matter of record, he says he's won 87% of his cases.
[02:39:23.055 --> 02:39:25.517]  I don't know any lawyers have done that's able to make that happen.
[02:39:25.557 --> 02:39:32.222]  There was an article in Fox News a few years ago where it admitted that pro se litigants win more than the national average of lawyers.
[02:39:32.523 --> 02:39:33.303]  Yeah, there you have it.
[02:39:33.323 --> 02:39:36.486]  A lot of these lawyers, man, they just don't know any of the facts.
[02:39:36.506 --> 02:39:37.687]  They don't even know how the law works.
[02:39:38.187 --> 02:39:40.029]  No, they really don't.
[02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:44.653]  And Gary Spence will even tell you that.
[02:39:44.693 --> 02:39:46.594]  He's a top lawyer out of Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
[02:39:46.694 --> 02:39:47.115]  Oh, I know.
[02:39:47.155 --> 02:39:47.675]  He's great.
[02:39:48.716 --> 02:39:52.179]  But anyways, yeah, I just thought I'd put that bug in your ear because I haven't heard
[02:39:52.918 --> 02:39:54.598]  I haven't heard Gordon on your show for a long time.
[02:39:55.499 --> 02:40:00.520]  I think the last time I called in was during a show you had with him on about three or four years ago.
[02:40:01.240 --> 02:40:04.941]  Alright, well good to have you calling back into the broadcast.
[02:40:05.121 --> 02:40:06.501]  Hey, glad to hear from you Alex.
[02:40:06.541 --> 02:40:07.582]  Keep up the good work, okay?
[02:40:07.762 --> 02:40:08.882]  Hey, appreciate the call Chris.
[02:40:09.482 --> 02:40:11.563]  Another Chris, this time in Illinois.
[02:40:11.663 --> 02:40:12.503]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:40:12.543 --> 02:40:12.963]  Go ahead.
[02:40:13.483 --> 02:40:13.803]  Hello?
[02:40:14.163 --> 02:40:14.443]  Yes sir.
[02:40:14.503 --> 02:40:15.064]  Hi Alex.
[02:40:15.824 --> 02:40:20.545]  I live close to our county's GOP headquarters.
[02:40:21.351 --> 02:40:31.897]  And I had made, um, I was listening to your show about, um, the Bush-Nazi ties a while back, and, um... Well, that was in the London Guardian, uh, 13-page article, yes.
[02:40:31.997 --> 02:40:32.318]  Right.
[02:40:32.458 --> 02:40:50.949]  Well, um, I took a poster board and I made a... I was gonna make it into a picket sign and just go hang out in front of their store on the sidewalk, but it said, Our Lord George Bush's Grandfather Funded Hitler, and, uh, it was raining the day I was gonna go out, so I just went and put it in front of the
[02:40:51.727 --> 02:40:53.428]  Of the headquarters there.
[02:40:54.069 --> 02:40:57.511]  And I made another one, a big one, that said InfoWars.com.
[02:40:57.531 --> 02:40:59.872]  It was even bigger than the original sign.
[02:41:00.333 --> 02:41:09.819]  And I just laid them in front and, you know, I basically wanted just one person to question it and go to InfoWars.com basically was my intent.
[02:41:10.459 --> 02:41:14.922]  But the headquarters is right across the street from our local newspaper.
[02:41:16.343 --> 02:41:35.248]  And I, yesterday my friend called me and said, you gotta buy the newspaper and I opened it up and there's a picture of my sign and a big thing in there and I was just, you know, I hope that I went about, you know, I hope that that doesn't do a bad thing.
[02:41:35.268 --> 02:41:37.769]  No sir, it's your First Amendment right.
[02:41:37.809 --> 02:41:38.629]  That's what I was thinking.
[02:41:38.829 --> 02:41:41.530]  But tell us the town you're in and tell me about the newspaper.
[02:41:41.550 --> 02:41:42.310]  I want a copy of it.
[02:41:42.650 --> 02:41:43.011]  Oh, okay.
[02:41:43.291 --> 02:41:44.231]  Moline, Illinois.
[02:41:44.791 --> 02:41:46.813]  And, uh, the Daily Dispatch, it's called.
[02:41:47.074 --> 02:41:55.342]  Okay, the Daily, write that down, the Daily Dispatch, and, uh, so you put this sign up, what did the newspaper say about the sign?
[02:41:55.662 --> 02:41:59.987]  Oh, it said, prank, the headline was, Pranksters Target GOP Headquarters.
[02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:19.076]  No, it was a targeting by putting out a... And then she, the lady that, they interviewed the whatever, the head lady there, and they said she was concerned by the audacity of the people responsible for leaving the sign and worried about how secure the building is, you know?
[02:42:19.836 --> 02:42:23.278]  See how they're trying to start implying that our speech is better?
[02:42:23.298 --> 02:42:24.418]  You know what you need to do?
[02:42:24.438 --> 02:42:25.759]  You need to call the paper up.
[02:42:25.819 --> 02:42:27.660]  You need to say, I put the sign out there.
[02:42:27.680 --> 02:42:29.920]  It was raining so I left it there.
[02:42:30.481 --> 02:42:32.201]  And have you seen the London Guardian?
[02:42:32.502 --> 02:42:33.862]  Have you seen the mainstream news?
[02:42:33.942 --> 02:42:35.443]  Oh yeah, I downloaded that.
[02:42:35.543 --> 02:42:36.203]  I got that.
[02:42:36.223 --> 02:42:38.804]  But I mean, you need to call the paper and go, it's not a prank.
[02:42:39.205 --> 02:42:40.845]  We're bringing up a serious issue.
[02:42:41.125 --> 02:42:41.506]  I know!
[02:42:42.886 --> 02:42:45.387]  It's been in the Associated Press, the Nazi questions.
[02:42:45.827 --> 02:42:46.968]  What are they talking about?
[02:42:48.058 --> 02:42:50.703]  So have you called the Daily what?
[02:42:51.224 --> 02:42:51.765]  Dispatch.
[02:42:52.066 --> 02:42:52.707]  Dispatch.
[02:42:53.288 --> 02:42:57.557]  No, because I don't know whether or not I'm, you know, they can charge me vandalism or something.
[02:42:58.484 --> 02:43:01.185]  No sir, what was it, a foam board sign?
[02:43:01.405 --> 02:43:03.205]  Yeah, just a big poster board.
[02:43:03.705 --> 02:43:06.206]  A poster, and you leaned it up against a power pole or something?
[02:43:06.286 --> 02:43:08.487]  No, I leaned it right against their front door.
[02:43:08.767 --> 02:43:10.507]  Or underneath their window.
[02:43:10.567 --> 02:43:13.288]  It was against their building, but nothing got damaged, you know?
[02:43:13.348 --> 02:43:15.009]  Well of course, I mean that's no big deal.
[02:43:15.189 --> 02:43:17.829]  Yeah, and she said, uh, why can't people play fair?
[02:43:17.889 --> 02:43:21.070]  The voters are going to decide who is going to be president.
[02:43:21.090 --> 02:43:22.070]  Why can't they play fair?
[02:43:22.130 --> 02:43:24.391]  Someone was shot by our door!
[02:43:24.431 --> 02:43:25.851]  It was evil!
[02:43:25.911 --> 02:43:27.212]  It's a conspiracy!
[02:43:29.254 --> 02:43:31.096]  It was a prank!
[02:43:31.277 --> 02:43:33.019]  You know what we should do?
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:35.462]  What's the website for the Daily Dispatch?
[02:43:35.542 --> 02:43:38.667]  Everybody should email their editors, everyone about this.
[02:43:38.747 --> 02:43:39.908]  Listeners, do this for me.
[02:43:40.369 --> 02:43:41.611]  I can't do it all.
[02:43:42.151 --> 02:43:44.615]  I want them in their inbox to have a hundred London Guardian
[02:43:45.095 --> 02:43:47.457]  And a whole bunch of other news articles about the Bushes.
[02:43:47.938 --> 02:43:54.223]  And we have East Coast newspapers, mainstream news articles from 1942, scanned it on the site.
[02:43:54.563 --> 02:43:59.027]  Email knows about Prescott Bush grabbed by the Feds for dealing with Hitler.
[02:43:59.407 --> 02:44:04.311]  And I want their inbox to be full of mainstream news articles and go, are these pranks too?
[02:44:05.992 --> 02:44:10.393]  Okay, so what's the email address for the Daily Dispatch?
[02:44:10.413 --> 02:44:11.353]  Oh, God, I don't know.
[02:44:11.373 --> 02:44:14.134]  It's probably just... Well, sir, do you have the newspaper in front of you?
[02:44:14.314 --> 02:44:19.655]  Um, I have... Well, shoot, no, I got the article, and that's it, and all it says is QC area.
[02:44:19.675 --> 02:44:20.595]  It's in the Quad Cities.
[02:44:20.635 --> 02:44:27.336]  There is 350,000 people here, so a lot of people... But, sir, I mean, on the bottom of the newspaper is... Yeah, I know, I threw the paper out.
[02:44:27.756 --> 02:44:30.437]  And also, you didn't print out the news article on the web?
[02:44:31.079 --> 02:44:32.540]  Uh, they did.
[02:44:32.721 --> 02:44:33.742]  But I mean, you're in the newspaper.
[02:44:33.782 --> 02:44:34.843]  You didn't keep the newspaper?
[02:44:35.103 --> 02:44:36.804]  Yeah, no, I just kept the article.
[02:44:38.105 --> 02:44:38.946]  Oh, you just cut it out?
[02:44:39.407 --> 02:44:40.247]  Yeah, there goes my phone.
[02:44:40.428 --> 02:44:42.790]  Okay, well thanks for the call and good job!
[02:44:42.830 --> 02:44:45.312]  Look, you guaranteed a bunch of people walked by and saw it.
[02:44:46.062 --> 02:44:54.445]  And uh... guaranteed it's in the newspaper and some people later, you know, years later hear about Bush and Hitler and go, you know, I saw that sign.
[02:44:54.805 --> 02:44:58.266]  So that shows what you can do in this freaked out, cowardly society.
[02:44:58.306 --> 02:45:01.107]  There was a sign saying Bush is with Hitler!
[02:45:01.607 --> 02:45:03.167]  There was a sign!
[02:45:03.247 --> 02:45:05.368]  It was scary!
[02:45:06.028 --> 02:45:08.249]  Arrest him!
[02:45:08.329 --> 02:45:09.209]  Good job, Chris.
[02:45:09.889 --> 02:45:12.630]  Chris in Kentucky, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:45:13.010 --> 02:45:14.010]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:45:14.051 --> 02:45:14.551]  It's been a while.
[02:45:15.990 --> 02:45:22.355]  You know, our county commissioner, Tony Miller, wants to take the insurance cards and the proof of insurance and put them in databases.
[02:45:22.415 --> 02:45:24.017]  Have you heard anything about that?
[02:45:24.057 --> 02:45:30.482]  Yeah, that's a national move that people don't have their insurance, so we've got to have it all scanned and tracked and controlled.
[02:45:30.542 --> 02:45:31.222]  It's all part of that.
[02:45:32.003 --> 02:45:32.724]  The new freedom.
[02:45:33.864 --> 02:45:37.648]  But the jails have been ordered to release the illegal aliens when they don't have insurance.
[02:45:37.708 --> 02:45:39.109]  They are above the citizens.
[02:45:39.809 --> 02:45:40.470]  Oh, that's right.
[02:45:40.510 --> 02:45:40.990]  That's right.
[02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.871]  That's our new freedom.
[02:45:41.911 --> 02:45:42.632]  And I'll tell you something.
[02:45:42.672 --> 02:45:45.514]  I've talked to some people from Iraq that have been here for many years.
[02:45:45.888 --> 02:45:50.599]  The question I asked him about the job, they know all about the CIA putting him in power.
[02:45:51.161 --> 02:45:53.062]  They know it.
[02:45:53.122 --> 02:45:56.482]  I remember in the 80's he was a hero on the news.
[02:45:56.663 --> 02:45:58.443]  They admittedly trained him as an assassin in 1954.
[02:45:59.443 --> 02:46:01.804]  Made him the head of the Ba'ath security apparatus in 1968.
[02:46:01.864 --> 02:46:04.765]  Put him in as dictator in 1979.
[02:46:05.865 --> 02:46:07.185]  Ordered him to invade Iran.
[02:46:07.205 --> 02:46:10.166]  Gave him over 40 billion dollars in the next 7 years.
[02:46:10.786 --> 02:46:12.327]  Told him to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[02:46:12.367 --> 02:46:13.307]  He was following orders.
[02:46:13.647 --> 02:46:14.487]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:46:14.648 --> 02:46:15.428]  And I don't support him.
[02:46:15.448 --> 02:46:16.128]  I think it was horrible.
[02:46:16.556 --> 02:46:17.177]  Yeah, it was.
[02:46:17.197 --> 02:46:17.937]  It absolutely was.
[02:46:17.977 --> 02:46:19.599]  Horrible that he followed orders of his masters.
[02:46:19.859 --> 02:46:21.281]  But the masters are worse.
[02:46:21.621 --> 02:46:22.222]  Who's worse?
[02:46:22.302 --> 02:46:24.023]  The Mafia Capo or the Don?
[02:46:24.424 --> 02:46:24.964]  That's true.
[02:46:25.745 --> 02:46:28.127]  But the Don's going to save us, don't worry.
[02:46:28.328 --> 02:46:29.369]  Yeah, they really were.
[02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:31.871]  And that's why we have Terrace Drill on the double Louisville.
[02:46:31.891 --> 02:46:34.193]  They did that here with the Louisville Metropolitan Police.
[02:46:34.213 --> 02:46:35.775]  They had their black ski masks on.
[02:46:36.625 --> 02:46:38.607]  Oh, people were just saying they feel so safe.
[02:46:38.667 --> 02:46:40.649]  It was on the news how they did these drills.
[02:46:40.729 --> 02:46:41.749]  It's just for your freedom.
[02:46:41.970 --> 02:46:42.930]  Martial law drills?
[02:46:42.970 --> 02:46:43.791]  They're good.
[02:46:43.831 --> 02:46:45.212]  All over the country.
[02:46:45.232 --> 02:46:46.974]  People in the military, people in FEMA.
[02:46:46.994 --> 02:46:48.295]  I'm getting the emails, the letters.
[02:46:48.715 --> 02:46:49.956]  Personal people on the street.
[02:46:50.537 --> 02:46:54.780]  They are prepared for total martial law this month going into January.
[02:46:54.900 --> 02:46:58.584]  I don't know if they're going to pull it, but they're certainly training everybody for it.
[02:46:58.984 --> 02:46:59.765]  And Fort Knox.
[02:46:59.865 --> 02:47:01.486]  Now they're going to do that with Fort Knox.
[02:47:01.546 --> 02:47:03.668]  Terrorists in surrounding counties are going to get ready for troops.
[02:47:04.554 --> 02:47:07.035]  Well, it's all part of freedom, but the border stays wide open.
[02:47:07.335 --> 02:47:09.136]  Thanks for the call, Chris.
[02:47:09.816 --> 02:47:10.997]  This is what's happened.
[02:47:11.277 --> 02:47:12.118]  Great points, Chris.
[02:47:12.458 --> 02:47:13.138]  This is what's happened.
[02:47:13.538 --> 02:47:32.627]  It's like, there's an enemy outside the gates, so you lower the drawbridge, the drawbridge is on both entrances to the city, and then you dispatch the citadel guard, the town guard, the castle guard, to guard the men, women, and children in their beds, to aim spears at them, because they might attack.
[02:47:33.214 --> 02:47:46.997]  And so the enemy's pouring in, the terrorists, you know, the global system, everything, pouring through the gates, and the troops that are supposed to guard the city are all in there with swords to the necks of the women and children afraid in their beds.
[02:47:49.897 --> 02:47:54.678]  And the government gives bonuses to the guards that lower the drawbridge.
[02:47:54.818 --> 02:47:55.799]  That's what happened with 9-11.
[02:47:56.239 --> 02:47:57.579]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[02:47:58.179 --> 02:48:00.580]  Here's that clip, Mercury is Nutritious.
[02:48:01.480 --> 02:48:02.360]  Go ahead and play that clip.
[02:48:02.978 --> 02:48:05.400]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[02:48:05.660 --> 02:48:09.002]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[02:48:09.282 --> 02:48:11.323]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[02:48:11.423 --> 02:48:14.085]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[02:48:14.105 --> 02:48:17.527]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Shima Mather.
[02:48:20.154 --> 02:48:26.117]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[02:48:26.597 --> 02:48:33.041]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[02:48:33.061 --> 02:48:40.364]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[02:48:40.484 --> 02:48:40.825]  Alright!
[02:48:41.145 --> 02:48:43.446]  We'll be back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:45.828 --> 02:48:50.150]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.350 --> 02:48:54.752]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.912 --> 02:48:59.294]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.314 --> 02:49:00.675]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.495 --> 02:49:02.355]  Panama.
[02:49:02.475 --> 02:49:06.696]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.756 --> 02:49:13.697]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.817 --> 02:49:15.878]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.198 --> 02:49:26.500]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:32.243]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!
[02:49:32.703 --> 02:49:35.905]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:35.945 --> 02:49:36.445]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.465 --> 02:49:37.745]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:49:45.249 --> 02:49:51.493]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:51.613 --> 02:49:57.796]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:49:58.056 --> 02:50:06.521]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.741 --> 02:50:13.765]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:14.065 --> 02:50:18.908]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:19.108 --> 02:50:24.512]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:24.852 --> 02:50:27.954]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:50:28.275 --> 02:50:36.200]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:36.280 --> 02:50:36.840]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:45.866 --> 02:50:46.446]  We're good to go.
[02:51:01.710 --> 02:51:02.310]  I think so.
[02:51:24.281 --> 02:51:26.362]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.

[02:51:31.206 --> 02:51:34.288]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.

[02:51:56.336 --> 02:52:00.957]  I'll try to jam a few more calls in here from James and Debbie, but I didn't even get to this.
[02:52:00.997 --> 02:52:02.618]  This is Scripps Howard News Service.
[02:52:02.958 --> 02:52:16.443]  Hack and Heat could take on a new meaning in Iraq, and it says they're not just going to have big microwave guns, little handheld ones are going to be given out to the police, and it describes it as ray guns.
[02:52:17.868 --> 02:52:18.689]  Very serious.
[02:52:18.789 --> 02:52:19.509]  Also, U.S.
[02:52:19.569 --> 02:52:21.270]  pitches biometrics to Europe.
[02:52:21.790 --> 02:52:23.451]  They're over there wanting to merge our U.S.
[02:52:23.511 --> 02:52:27.013]  visas and as well as our driver's license again biometrically.
[02:52:27.053 --> 02:52:28.114]  That's out of the Australian.
[02:52:28.134 --> 02:52:29.474]  Another article here.
[02:52:29.495 --> 02:52:34.717]  EU's Data Protection Commissioner is concerned about biometrics on smart cards.
[02:52:34.757 --> 02:52:39.340]  They go on to say that despite popular belief, biometrics are easy to steal and fake.
[02:52:40.345 --> 02:52:45.690]  And it gets into how this is very, very dangerous, this whole trend.
[02:52:45.710 --> 02:52:54.397]  Another article here, out of USA Today, it says, TSA cannot be trusted.
[02:52:54.417 --> 02:52:58.981]  The Transportation Security Administration wants the flying public to trust it.
[02:52:59.562 --> 02:53:15.875]  With the travel records of everyone who flew in June, the TSA wants those 54 million records, which include everything from credit card numbers to whether a kosher meal was requested, to test SecureFlight, a revised version of the discredited proposal for passenger profiling system known as CAPS2.
[02:53:16.956 --> 02:53:18.957]  And it knows your divorce records, everything else.
[02:53:18.977 --> 02:53:22.280]  It's just, it's going to be like this to drive your car down the road, my friends.
[02:53:23.228 --> 02:53:30.775]  And then of course now they're moving implantable microchips to more nightclubs in Europe if you want to be able to go into the nightclub and be in the VIP section.
[02:53:31.215 --> 02:53:33.377]  More governments are making their employees take them.
[02:53:33.758 --> 02:53:36.921]  More militaries are making their people take the chips.
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:48.023]  And they've also now come right out and openly admitted to everyone that they're going to put smart trackers in all the cars by law very soon.
[02:53:48.083 --> 02:53:54.164]  Official federal government statements from World Net Daily to track you with a transponder and tax you.
[02:53:54.744 --> 02:53:59.645]  So the life I'm going to lead here in Austin under this is what you're going to have in your town unless we just say no to this.
[02:54:00.986 --> 02:54:03.646]  So, headline, Feds plan to track every car.
[02:54:03.686 --> 02:54:06.367]  Obscure agency working on technology to monitor all vehicles.
[02:54:07.631 --> 02:54:11.013]  Before I take a final call, if I have time, I just want to encourage you.
[02:54:11.453 --> 02:54:12.714]  I don't spend a lot of time on this.
[02:54:12.754 --> 02:54:13.675]  I don't belabor it.
[02:54:14.035 --> 02:54:15.516]  But you should take advantage of it.
[02:54:15.536 --> 02:54:16.537]  You should take action.
[02:54:16.977 --> 02:54:18.078]  I've made 11 films.
[02:54:18.238 --> 02:54:18.898]  They're excellent.
[02:54:18.938 --> 02:54:19.939]  They wake people up.
[02:54:21.420 --> 02:54:25.062]  If we weren't out here fighting the New World Order, things would be a lot worse right now.
[02:54:25.862 --> 02:54:32.028]  So please go to www.InfoWars.com or www.PrisonPlanet.com Peruse the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[02:54:32.388 --> 02:54:34.290]  Watch the video clips from the films.
[02:54:34.650 --> 02:54:35.331]  Read about them.
[02:54:35.431 --> 02:54:37.693]  Look at the different discounts we have, different packages.
[02:54:38.193 --> 02:54:39.214]  Order some of the films.
[02:54:39.314 --> 02:54:41.056]  Watch them yourself to get more informed.
[02:54:41.676 --> 02:54:42.797]  Show them to other people.
[02:54:42.877 --> 02:54:43.858]  It's so important.
[02:54:44.178 --> 02:54:46.140]  My new film, American Dictators, is out.
[02:54:47.081 --> 02:54:48.082]  It's an amazing video.
[02:54:49.191 --> 02:54:49.932]  You need to have it.
[02:54:50.032 --> 02:54:51.293]  Also my 9-11 films.
[02:54:51.673 --> 02:54:52.894]  Toll-free number to order them.
[02:54:52.914 --> 02:54:53.595]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:53.615 --> 02:54:56.337]  Big discounts when you get three or more of any of my films.
[02:54:56.357 --> 02:54:56.417]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:56.437 --> 02:54:58.899]  My videos are all over two hours long.
[02:54:58.919 --> 02:54:59.420]  They're $25.95 apiece.
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:00.581]  $19.95 when you order three or more.
[02:55:00.621 --> 02:55:03.123]  My new film is 90 minutes long, so it's only $19.95 by itself.
[02:55:18.135 --> 02:55:19.698]  And of course, my book, Descent to Tyranny, is $12.
[02:55:19.738 --> 02:55:19.959]  So 1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:19.999 --> 02:55:23.344]  James, in Indiana, you'll be our last caller.
[02:55:23.525 --> 02:55:24.306]  Sorry to others.
[02:55:24.366 --> 02:55:25.168]  Go ahead, James.
[02:55:31.605 --> 02:55:34.046]  Hey Alex, I didn't want to take up too much of your time.
[02:55:34.066 --> 02:55:35.247]  I wanted to say thanks.
[02:55:35.707 --> 02:55:37.087]  You're a great patriot.
[02:55:37.107 --> 02:55:41.029]  I just wanted to tell you about an experience that I had last weekend.
[02:55:41.109 --> 02:55:44.330]  It was somewhat the police day, you know, getting more and more power out there.
[02:55:45.031 --> 02:55:52.994]  We were at a club with a couple of my friends and we were just talking some politics about how we were upset with the administration and everything that was going on.
[02:55:53.806 --> 02:55:54.227]  Yes, sir.
[02:56:06.964 --> 02:56:10.747]  So you're at a big, was it a loud bar?
[02:56:11.548 --> 02:56:23.197]  Ok, so you're sitting in a bar talking about stuff and it upsets people so they call the cops thinking they're living in Russia and then on top of it the cops think we live in Russia and come over and talk to you.
[02:56:23.257 --> 02:56:24.158]  What ended up happening?
[02:56:24.867 --> 02:56:27.294]  Well, I mean, they were trying to tell us to calm down and everything.
[02:56:27.314 --> 02:56:30.261]  One of my friends was like, well, it's nice to know that the S.S.
[02:56:30.322 --> 02:56:31.184]  is looking out for us.
[02:56:31.725 --> 02:56:34.693]  As soon as that was said, we were taken outside and asked to leave.
[02:56:34.713 --> 02:56:35.555]  Bye-bye!
