[00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:06.460]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.180]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.001]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.461]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.221 --> 00:00:13.141]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.802 --> 00:00:17.463]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.963 --> 00:00:22.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:35.808]  Alright my friends, very important broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:41.392]  Already the 29th day of June 2004.
[00:00:42.373 --> 00:00:45.275]  Coming up on our nation's birthday, July 4th.
[00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:57.885]  That was the Declaration of Independence, which the government openly teaches in law enforcement colleges and to police across the nation.
[00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.267]  They teach the terrorist
[00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.521]  Document.
[00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:10.529]  Who knows, I might read the Declaration of Independence on air today if I have time, or at least some portions of it.
[00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.231]  Okay.
[00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:17.815]  Coming up in the next hour, I've been meaning to interview this guy for a while, but we're going to be talking to him.
[00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:19.157]  He's Phil Jahan.
[00:01:19.597 --> 00:01:20.818]  He has the 911letsroll.com website.
[00:01:24.813 --> 00:01:35.337]  The videos of the planes with the pods on the bottoms and the rest of it, and I mean this is real information that needs to be looked at.
[00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:51.304]  Now I don't spend all my time on it, I spend most of my 9-11 time on public officials being warned not to fly, the Bush's and the Bin Laden's, Al Qaeda being CIA, Bin Laden meeting with the CIA, CIA insider trading,
[00:01:52.652 --> 00:01:55.053]  Most of the hijackers still being alive.
[00:01:56.253 --> 00:01:59.635]  There's hundreds of those points that are totally documented.
[00:02:01.055 --> 00:02:06.557]  That cannot be weeviled around, that the government cannot answer to.
[00:02:08.158 --> 00:02:15.120]  When you have subjects like what hit the Pentagon, when obviously, folks, something weird's going on there, and, hey, what's on the bottom of that plane?
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.601]  And I mean, I've got videos from when it happened.
[00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:20.622]  I mean, it's on the videos I take.
[00:02:21.565 --> 00:02:23.106]  It's on the French video.
[00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:26.228]  Something's going on with these aircraft.
[00:02:27.688 --> 00:02:29.730]  So we should spend some time discussing.
[00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.853]  All I've ever said is that we need to spend time looking at all of it, discussing all of it.
[00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:37.554]  That's been my approach.
[00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:43.497]  And that's not criticism of those that focus on the architecture of the buildings and the bombs inside.
[00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:45.098]  We've spent a lot of time on that.
[00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.400]  That's not criticizing people who focus on
[00:02:49.093 --> 00:02:54.756]  You know, what really hit the Pentagon, or missile pods, or control pods, on the bottom of the aircraft?
[00:02:54.776 --> 00:02:56.937]  I mean, there's a lot of evidence in that direction.
[00:02:58.118 --> 00:03:03.521]  I would just say that it's not ironclad, because you'll never be able to totally conclusively prove it.
[00:03:04.801 --> 00:03:11.765]  But we'll talk about that with Phil Jahan, and also his story from a few days ago, that we talked about yesterday.
[00:03:11.785 --> 00:03:16.888]  Has the Flight 93 shoot-down pilot been identified?
[00:03:18.211 --> 00:03:20.033]  You know, is this accurate information?
[00:03:21.093 --> 00:03:27.038]  Or are Colonel Donna Grand Prix and Phil Jayhan and even myself being fed this info?
[00:03:27.298 --> 00:03:31.962]  We've always got to be watchful for that and just ask the questions.
[00:03:32.723 --> 00:03:35.565]  And so that's what I've been endeavoring to do.
[00:03:35.685 --> 00:03:37.687]  So that's in the second hour.
[00:03:39.308 --> 00:03:44.052]  The websites of course are PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com,
[00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.332]  And of course, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:48.392 --> 00:03:53.735]  And boy, there is so much, so much important news that we're going to be covering here today.
[00:03:55.536 --> 00:03:56.376]  Where to start?
[00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:02.439]  Army plans involuntary call-up of thousands.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.101]  Associated Press.
[00:04:06.315 --> 00:04:08.597]  Now, again, that's a form of draft.
[00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:10.158]  In fact, the worst type of draft.
[00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.421]  These people have already voluntarily served.
[00:04:13.882 --> 00:04:16.043]  You can't say, oh, make them hippie serve.
[00:04:16.604 --> 00:04:20.027]  No, they've already served, in some cases, five, ten years.
[00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:26.432]  And now they're going to force them to re-up.
[00:04:27.573 --> 00:04:28.734]  That is conscription.
[00:04:29.074 --> 00:04:31.737]  The worst type of conscription.
[00:04:31.757 --> 00:04:34.399]  And they're heating up for the big draft next year for all of us.
[00:04:36.187 --> 00:04:44.992]  Also, a headline here, and this has been in Capitol Hill Blue, it's been in the Daily Times, it's been in a bunch of different websites.
[00:04:45.253 --> 00:04:48.054]  Now, Bush going crazy, say his aides.
[00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:51.256]  I don't agree with this, really, folks, but we'll go over it.
[00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:54.998]  Also, House bill would enforce Patriot Act secrecy clause.
[00:04:55.018 --> 00:04:55.799]  Wait to hear about this.
[00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:58.200]  Just a lot of key information coming up.
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.981]  You'll want to stay with us.
[00:05:01.872 --> 00:05:04.173]  My family's breathing easier and now you can too!
[00:05:04.353 --> 00:05:07.715]  Hey folks, Michael Trudell here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:10.016]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[00:05:10.196 --> 00:05:16.159]  It works at the molecular level, binding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[00:05:16.359 --> 00:05:18.940]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:19.861]  Nothing escapes!
[00:05:19.981 --> 00:05:24.203]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:28.005]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[00:05:28.125 --> 00:05:30.346]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone!
[00:05:30.606 --> 00:05:30.906]  Smoke?
[00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:33.007]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[00:05:33.187 --> 00:05:36.247]  Our BioZone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[00:05:36.467 --> 00:05:40.568]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your BioZone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[00:05:40.748 --> 00:05:43.389]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.
[00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.329]  Call toll-free 888-88-MY-AIR today.
[00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.790]  That's 1-888-88-MY-AIR.
[00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:51.850]  Or visit www.purifymyair.com.
[00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.571]  That's purifymyair.com.
[00:05:53.751 --> 00:05:57.111]  Order yours today, and you'll get a bathroom ionizer, a $40 value, free!
[00:05:57.191 --> 00:06:00.152]  Get your BioZone Air Purifier today, and you'll be breathing easier, too.
[00:06:01.149 --> 00:06:05.495]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.696 --> 00:06:10.122]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:10.282 --> 00:06:11.524]  There is a chance.
[00:06:12.034 --> 00:06:14.677]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.697 --> 00:06:17.561]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:06:17.821 --> 00:06:22.046]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:22.106 --> 00:06:29.034]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:31.197]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.397 --> 00:06:41.960]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.521]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:06:48.022 --> 00:06:51.943]  Visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.963 --> 00:06:52.403]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:52.503 --> 00:06:54.263]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.807]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:07:03.867 --> 00:07:08.049]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:11.090]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.692]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:07:13.872 --> 00:07:22.536]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:07:22.716 --> 00:07:24.057]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:07:24.257 --> 00:07:28.439]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:29.379]  We're good to go!
[00:07:47.705 --> 00:07:48.165]  Big Brother.
[00:07:48.185 --> 00:07:49.005]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:49.765]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:49.805 --> 00:07:50.386]  You want answers?
[00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:51.206]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.855 --> 00:08:17.837]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:22.158]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:39.708 --> 00:08:44.610]  Alright, 8 minutes and 35 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:46.071]  Thank you for joining us again.
[00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:56.615]  In the first little segment, I talked about how we've got Phil Jahan of 911Let'sRoll.com or .org, excuse me, coming on the broadcast.
[00:08:58.176 --> 00:09:01.057]  And we're going to talk about missile pods on the bottom of the planes.
[00:09:01.097 --> 00:09:02.417]  We're going to talk about the Pentagon.
[00:09:02.437 --> 00:09:06.199]  We're going to talk about Colonel Donna Grand Prix and Mr. Jahan.
[00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:14.973]  The two of them have been saying that they know the identity of the pilot that shot down Flight 93.
[00:09:15.393 --> 00:09:21.195]  And clearly from the eyewitnesses, the police and others, they said they saw F-16s shooting it down.
[00:09:21.235 --> 00:09:23.616]  And clearly an 8-mile debris field.
[00:09:23.676 --> 00:09:25.436]  I mean, that's where all the evidence is pointing.
[00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:27.737]  But we cannot totally confirm it.
[00:09:28.237 --> 00:09:30.878]  That's why we're trying to ferret out more information.
[00:09:32.991 --> 00:09:37.353]  As a news broadcast, and so we're going to have Phil Jahan on, as I said, in the next hour.
[00:09:37.853 --> 00:09:47.136]  He's been up in D.C., and his voice is almost gone, but we appreciate him coming on the show with us here in about 51 minutes.
[00:09:48.097 --> 00:09:50.338]  So, again, that is coming up.
[00:09:51.978 --> 00:09:52.458]  All right.
[00:09:53.079 --> 00:10:00.261]  Something that is totally ironclad, but is still being called a conspiracy theory is the national draft.
[00:10:00.321 --> 00:10:01.802]  And I'm sorry to those listeners
[00:10:02.441 --> 00:10:06.622]  That have been listening the last two years as we covered the draft, the impending draft.
[00:10:06.662 --> 00:10:07.802]  You were sick of hearing about this.
[00:10:07.962 --> 00:10:10.403]  I'm sick of talking about it, but we have to restate the facts.
[00:10:12.084 --> 00:10:28.728]  Because scores, legions of news articles are being written saying that there is no such thing as a draft, that it's a wild urban legend, a wives tale.
[00:10:30.675 --> 00:10:34.357]  And why do all these weirdos on the left and right think that a draft is coming?
[00:10:35.277 --> 00:10:39.759]  Maybe because the government's re-authorizing and setting up the draft boards.
[00:10:40.439 --> 00:10:46.522]  Maybe because senators and congressmen like Hagel and Rangel have called for it.
[00:10:47.102 --> 00:10:53.645]  Perhaps because there's a bunch of different versions of different draft legislation bills in Congress.
[00:10:55.333 --> 00:11:01.795]  Perhaps it's because the Army is saying they need double the troops they now have in Iraq to control the country.
[00:11:02.595 --> 00:11:09.157]  Maybe it's because enlistment has fallen off by 35 to 50 plus percent depending on what service it is.
[00:11:11.078 --> 00:11:12.438]  That's the reality here.
[00:11:14.359 --> 00:11:23.202]  The government is saying, committee chairmen have been saying, they're getting ready to study it and they're going to try to pass it next year.
[00:11:25.007 --> 00:11:36.197]  Obviously, during the election year, while they're setting it all up, and we notice that they're going to go, oh no, never mind, just go back to sleep, we wouldn't dare pass a draft because it's so wildly unpopular.
[00:11:38.039 --> 00:11:50.310]  I mean, if we've handed over Iraq, if it's so sovereign, this former CIA terrorist, current CIA terrorist, has been appointed by our government, and Saddam has been handed over to him, but our troops run the prison he's in.
[00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:51.691]  I mean, it's a joke, people!
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.441]  There's so much freedom over there, we can leave!
[00:11:55.461 --> 00:11:57.621]  You know, let the dirty U.N.
[00:11:57.681 --> 00:11:57.982]  have it!
[00:11:58.022 --> 00:11:58.382]  No, the U.N.
[00:11:58.422 --> 00:12:02.823]  is going to come in and direct our troops, and Bush now says last week that we're going to be under U.N.
[00:12:02.843 --> 00:12:05.884]  control, and he's going to go ahead and let us be under international law.
[00:12:06.164 --> 00:12:07.164]  Oh, how conservative!
[00:12:09.805 --> 00:12:17.948]  And, for the last year, regular Army, regular Marines, regular Navy, regular Air Force enlisted,
[00:12:19.967 --> 00:12:26.273]  Officers, as well, have been told, hey, you didn't read the fine print when you signed up 15, 10, 3 years ago.
[00:12:28.054 --> 00:12:29.195]  You didn't read the fine print.
[00:12:29.375 --> 00:12:31.917]  Once you sign on, we can keep you in here indefinitely.
[00:12:32.018 --> 00:12:32.458]  Forever.
[00:12:32.478 --> 00:12:34.019]  20-something years.
[00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:39.344]  So they've already been doing that, but finally it's starting to come out in the mainstream media.
[00:12:39.724 --> 00:12:41.686]  This is out of the Associated Press today.
[00:12:43.499 --> 00:12:46.102]  Army plans involuntary call-up of thousands.
[00:12:46.603 --> 00:12:46.903]  The U.S.
[00:12:47.023 --> 00:12:57.256]  Army is planning an involuntary mobilization of thousands of reserve troops to maintain adequate force levels in the Iraq and Afghanistan defense, officials said on Monday.
[00:12:58.817 --> 00:13:02.402]  The move involved the seldom tapped
[00:13:03.323 --> 00:13:09.506]  Individual Ready Reserve represents the last evidence of the strain being placed on the U.S.
[00:13:09.546 --> 00:13:13.308]  military, particularly the Army, by operations in those two countries.
[00:13:14.308 --> 00:13:26.714]  Roughly 5,600 soldiers from the Ready Reserves will be notified of possible deployment this year, including some soldiers who will be notified within the month of an Army official speaking on a condition of anonymity.
[00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:35.843]  Senior defense officials said these individuals are being called back to fill specific shortages for specific jobs.
[00:13:37.924 --> 00:13:49.010]  And he said the last time the ready reserves were used, or soldiers who had completed their active duty obligations, was mobilized in any significant numbers was during the 91 Gulf War.
[00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:57.855]  Army officials are in the process of briefing members of Congress on the mobilization plan, a formal announcement on Wednesday.
[00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.962]  And again, I mean, I see one of these articles every few weeks.
[00:14:04.002 --> 00:14:06.584]  This is just one new wave of it.
[00:14:08.145 --> 00:14:10.787]  We've got troops in over 160 countries.
[00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:21.074]  From 160 plus thousand in Iraq to a couple dozen in Grenada.
[00:14:22.955 --> 00:14:25.136]  But they've got them spread all over the place.
[00:14:25.817 --> 00:14:27.298]  Tens of thousands in Germany.
[00:14:29.105 --> 00:14:35.130]  Tens of thousands in South Korea, tens of thousands in Japan, hundreds of countries, over 160.
[00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:45.179]  And now they're saying they want to go into Iran, they want to go into Syria, they want to go into all these new countries.
[00:14:47.661 --> 00:14:53.646]  And they're telling you in the media, oh no, there's no plan for a draft as the bills are introduced.
[00:14:54.602 --> 00:14:59.325]  And it's a new type of draft, the National Compulsory Service Act.
[00:15:00.005 --> 00:15:08.590]  There's different versions of it, but drafts for professionals, drafts for young people, women as well in some of the versions of the bill, 18 to 49.
[00:15:09.931 --> 00:15:13.193]  But don't worry, you'll be able to serve here domestically as a good little slave.
[00:15:13.833 --> 00:15:15.174]  It's a new type of draft.
[00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:17.135]  It's national service.
[00:15:17.815 --> 00:15:18.836]  It's for everybody.
[00:15:21.638 --> 00:15:41.888]  And under a draft, they can make you take all the vaccines, make you take all the drug tests, make you go out and be their little guinea pigs, and then they've said the domestic groups of people that stay here are going to be running checkpoints and involved in community action under the government's control and spying on their neighbors.
[00:15:41.968 --> 00:15:45.209]  I mean, it doesn't get much more Orwellian than this!
[00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.852]  And all of this on the heels of the articles yesterday
[00:15:53.231 --> 00:16:10.737]  Where Bush comes out, and the Supreme Court says, the President is allowed to arrest anybody he wants to, secretly arrest them, not give them a trial, but don't worry, they can complain to the Judge Advocate General, they can complain to the secret military court.
[00:16:10.757 --> 00:16:14.639]  I mean, talk about more double speak!
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.241]  The levels of double speak and double think that we're witnessing
[00:16:21.118 --> 00:16:22.898]  are just mind-boggling.
[00:16:22.918 --> 00:16:39.942]  I mean, I go back to this appoint a government who appoints a president, increase the troop levels, the guy's guarded by our troops, our government runs everything, there's another 50,000, at least, private mercenaries, private contractors in Iraq, so that's over 200,000.
[00:16:40.002 --> 00:16:40.242]  That's 210,000 U.S.
[00:16:40.262 --> 00:16:41.163]  personnel of one type or another.
[00:16:41.183 --> 00:16:41.783]  Here in Iraq right now,
[00:16:48.467 --> 00:16:51.768]  And they say we're going to be there for ten years, that's the Pentagon's official reports.
[00:16:52.508 --> 00:16:54.089]  Wolfowitz just said it again yesterday.
[00:16:56.189 --> 00:16:57.390]  And this is freedom.
[00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:15.315]  And now the new puppet president, who's an admitted terrorist, bombing school buses and movie theaters full of men, women, and children, every day he's saying, martial law is good, we're going to have martial law, no criticism of the government, curfews, secret arrest, it's all going to intensify, this is freedom.
[00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:18.533]  Folks, martial law is not freedom.
[00:17:19.273 --> 00:17:21.315]  Appointed presidents is not freedom.
[00:17:22.756 --> 00:17:25.818]  But there's this big celebration at the U.N.
[00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:30.662]  with Tony Blair and George Bush and, oh, we've handed it over, they're now free.
[00:17:31.222 --> 00:17:44.792]  It's as fake as Bush on the aircraft carrier, even more fraudulent, than Bush on the aircraft carrier with Mission Accomplished in red, white, and blue, a giant banner, you know, strutting around in his fighter pilot outfit.
[00:17:47.585 --> 00:17:49.125]  I mean, the mission was not accomplished.
[00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:51.106]  It was not the end of military operations.
[00:17:52.786 --> 00:17:57.947]  This is the same president, remember, that got up there at the last State of the Union and called for the biggest amnesty ever.
[00:17:59.728 --> 00:18:03.569]  An amnesty that will make anyone and everyone that can get here who is here legal.
[00:18:03.869 --> 00:18:06.449]  That allows corporations to pay to bring people here.
[00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:08.850]  That erases the border entirely.
[00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:20.617]  They call the biggest amnesty ever, dwarfing anything ever known by Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or George Herbert Walker Bush, and he gets up there and says, this is not an amnesty!
[00:18:21.778 --> 00:18:24.741]  A five-year-old could look at the facts and know that's a lie.
[00:18:25.722 --> 00:18:28.864]  But I've had neocons corner me on the street and go, it's not an amnesty!
[00:18:29.505 --> 00:18:30.846]  Campaign finance is good!
[00:18:31.506 --> 00:18:32.507]  UNESCO's good!
[00:18:32.527 --> 00:18:36.330]  You know, the government's not doubling its growth rate.
[00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:37.351]  Yes, it is!
[00:18:38.027 --> 00:18:38.608]  Yes it is!
[00:18:38.668 --> 00:18:41.530]  And Bush says he's going to sign the Assault Weapons Ban.
[00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.972]  You people are idiots!
[00:18:44.672 --> 00:18:47.114]  I mean, what is your major malfunction?
[00:18:51.037 --> 00:18:51.558]  And you know what?
[00:18:51.578 --> 00:18:56.621]  You'll deny there's a draft coming until it happens after the next terror attack, and then you'll be out there, good, good, good.
[00:18:56.661 --> 00:18:58.603]  Well, you just send your children in, okay?
[00:18:58.623 --> 00:19:04.908]  To have their arms and legs blown off, and to breathe depleted uranium, which is going to be the number one cause of death, folks.
[00:19:05.575 --> 00:19:07.416]  And to take all these experimental vaccines?
[00:19:07.457 --> 00:19:08.778]  You just send yours, okay?
[00:19:08.818 --> 00:19:09.878]  Don't ask for mine!
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.801]  Don't you dare!
[00:19:16.023 --> 00:19:17.604]  Let Bush send his daughters!
[00:19:20.306 --> 00:19:22.107]  Let Cheney send his daughter!
[00:19:22.808 --> 00:19:26.991]  Let them send their children for their corporate war of greed and pure evil!
[00:19:29.113 --> 00:19:30.474]  I'm not gonna be part of this!
[00:19:34.648 --> 00:19:40.233]  Alright folks, we're going to break and we'll take your calls on these subjects and more at 1-800-259-9231.

[00:21:06.787 --> 00:21:10.488]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[00:21:10.808 --> 00:21:14.429]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:19.070]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:23.210]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[00:21:23.451 --> 00:21:24.151]  It really works!

[00:21:34.893 --> 00:21:38.174]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps and air tools.

[00:24:31.122 --> 00:24:35.203]  Alright my friends, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:24:37.763 --> 00:24:42.124]  But before we do that, let me continue with some of the most important news.
[00:24:43.185 --> 00:24:56.668]  Now last week I mentioned this, Capitol Hill Blue does a lot of really good reporting, a lot of accurate reporting, but I really don't buy into this and now it's been picked up by a bunch of other newspapers
[00:24:57.928 --> 00:25:01.050]  Bush going crazy says his aides.
[00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:04.211]  This is from the Asian News Channel.
[00:25:05.472 --> 00:25:05.572]  U.S.
[00:25:05.592 --> 00:25:13.856]  President George Bush is said to have gone crazy at times going over the edge in cursing the media, which he does do.
[00:25:13.896 --> 00:25:14.836]  Does that mean he's crazy?
[00:25:15.777 --> 00:25:24.541]  And liberal critics, while calling them enemies of the state, the Daily Times quoted an online publication, Capitol Hill Blue, saying on Monday,
[00:25:26.627 --> 00:25:31.728]  Well, I mean, Dick Cheney, it's admitted in the Associated Press, yelling the F-word at Senators and freaking out.
[00:25:31.768 --> 00:25:33.549]  I mean, does that mean they're crazy?
[00:25:33.609 --> 00:25:35.009]  No, it just means they're bullies.
[00:25:36.309 --> 00:25:40.350]  Bush has become increasingly unpredictable and erratic, the report said.
[00:25:41.211 --> 00:25:55.574]  In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President goes from quoting the Bible, that's to manipulate the population, in one breath to obscene tantrums against the media, Democrats, and others that he classifies as enemies of the state, it added.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:58.441]  Now, are they teaching this doctrine?
[00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:00.623]  Was FEMA teaching this before Bush got into office?
[00:26:00.903 --> 00:26:02.144]  Was Bill Clinton teaching this?
[00:26:02.525 --> 00:26:06.007]  Did Bill Clinton want to blame Oklahoma City on talk radio?
[00:26:06.708 --> 00:26:08.149]  Did Bill Clinton throw tantrums?
[00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:10.871]  Did Hillary hit him over the head with an ashtray?
[00:26:10.891 --> 00:26:12.933]  Yeah, does that mean they're crazy?
[00:26:12.993 --> 00:26:15.155]  No, they're a bunch of animals, a bunch of criminals!
[00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:26.872]  In meetings with top aides and administration officials, the President goes from quoting the Bible in one breath to obscene tantrums against the media, Democrats, and others that he classifies as enemies of the state.
[00:26:26.892 --> 00:26:35.294]  Remember Newsweek last week with a picture of the Oval Office desk and the light shining down and, you know, Bush is getting orders from on high?
[00:26:37.494 --> 00:26:39.975]  I guess he is from the Prince and Powers of the Air.
[00:26:42.535 --> 00:26:46.776]  From the Angel of Light, but certainly not from the God of the Bible, folks.
[00:26:47.737 --> 00:26:54.920]  Yeshua or Yahweh, Jesus, Jehovah, just absolutely amazing.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.423]  I mean, Bush is a member of one of the oldest and most admitted satanic cults, Skull and Bones.
[00:27:00.563 --> 00:27:03.384]  I've been to Bohemian Grove, where they worship Moloch.
[00:27:03.404 --> 00:27:04.925]  I mean, I don't care how nuts it sounds.
[00:27:05.746 --> 00:27:07.727]  Microchips under the skin sounds crazy.
[00:27:08.027 --> 00:27:11.529]  Secret arrest of citizens for no reason with no trial sounds crazy.
[00:27:12.249 --> 00:27:13.990]  Forced drugging of school children.
[00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:19.052]  Drug, uh, drug, uh, mental ill testing of the entire population sounds nuts.
[00:27:19.952 --> 00:27:21.013]  But it's all happening.
[00:27:21.033 --> 00:27:25.195]  You know, wires into your brain for depression sounds crazy.
[00:27:25.755 --> 00:27:27.095]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:27:27.135 --> 00:27:28.756]  We just covered the documented facts here.
[00:27:30.377 --> 00:27:35.059]  And occasionally you analyze things that, uh, are, well,
[00:27:36.388 --> 00:27:40.391]  Being discussed, but are not totally confirmed, so we can just analyze them.
[00:27:41.032 --> 00:27:43.014]  Like this article, is Bush going crazy?
[00:27:44.174 --> 00:27:47.337]  The headline is, Bush going crazy, say his aides.
[00:27:48.838 --> 00:27:58.807]  But when Newsweek comes out and says, ooh, he's this big crazy Christian, that's meant to make the left hate Christians even more, but then at the same time bolster Bush's supporters.
[00:27:59.187 --> 00:28:05.332]  So that's double-edged propaganda by the establishment to reaffirm the status quo and polarization.
[00:28:06.317 --> 00:28:08.659]  Bush, my friends, is not a Christian.
[00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:09.319]  Come on!
[00:28:11.221 --> 00:28:22.870]  According to it, the worried White House aides described Bush as a man on the edge, increasingly wary of those who disagree with him, and paranoid of a public that no longer trusts his policies in Iraq or at home.
[00:28:23.771 --> 00:28:25.392]  It reminds me of the Nixon days.
[00:28:25.493 --> 00:28:35.821]  It quoted a long-time GOP political consultant as saying, adding, everybody is an enemy, everybody is out to get him, that's the mood over there.
[00:28:37.563 --> 00:28:39.165]  So the globalists love to do this.
[00:28:39.265 --> 00:28:40.987]  They use Nixon to do their dirty work.
[00:28:41.047 --> 00:28:42.148]  They hang him out to dry.
[00:28:43.649 --> 00:28:46.192]  They use George Herbert Walker Bush to do their dirty work.
[00:28:46.212 --> 00:28:47.333]  They hang him out to dry.
[00:28:48.635 --> 00:28:53.059]  They use Bill Clinton to do their dirty work and then hang him out to dry in the media.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:55.101]  Same thing with Bush, folks.
[00:28:55.862 --> 00:28:56.723]  Bush is a puppet.
[00:28:56.783 --> 00:28:58.025]  He doesn't run anything.
[00:28:58.485 --> 00:29:00.227]  Focusing on him is a diversion.
[00:29:01.383 --> 00:29:09.067]  I don't think Bush is crazy in the classical sense of, you know, he thinks he's the Pope or, you know, he thinks he's a pink elephant.
[00:29:09.767 --> 00:29:11.608]  Or he thinks there's little men inside his head.
[00:29:12.589 --> 00:29:13.809]  Is he sociopathic?
[00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:16.331]  Is he a Luciferian?
[00:29:17.211 --> 00:29:17.891]  Is he evil?
[00:29:18.292 --> 00:29:19.652]  Absolutely.
[00:29:20.172 --> 00:29:21.253]  But is he cogent?
[00:29:23.754 --> 00:29:24.054]  Yes.
[00:29:26.075 --> 00:29:27.036]  From everything I've seen.
[00:29:28.556 --> 00:29:29.856]  But does he cuss at people?
[00:29:29.876 --> 00:29:31.197]  Well, that's been out for a while.
[00:29:31.277 --> 00:29:32.197]  I mean, does he blow up?
[00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:33.277]  Well, yes.
[00:29:34.218 --> 00:29:35.978]  But that doesn't constitute insanity.
[00:29:37.178 --> 00:29:37.979]  But again, it doesn't matter.
[00:29:38.039 --> 00:29:39.539]  Bush is a puppet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:41.179 --> 00:29:44.400]  All right, we'll come back, go to your calls, get to a bunch of other news.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.761]  There is so much of it today.
[00:29:45.781 --> 00:29:50.842]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.862 --> 00:29:52.802]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.243 --> 00:29:54.763]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.773 --> 00:29:58.445]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.744 --> 00:30:03.165]  Somebody wants to sue you.

[00:31:01.465 --> 00:31:05.346]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.586 --> 00:31:11.028]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.308 --> 00:31:21.671]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:21.831 --> 00:31:26.173]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.373 --> 00:31:27.193]  Try Halo Methane.
[00:31:27.213 --> 00:31:28.154]  We're good to go!

[00:32:01.332 --> 00:32:03.693]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:03.953 --> 00:32:07.794]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:08.914]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.355 --> 00:32:13.496]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:13.696 --> 00:32:17.877]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.257 --> 00:32:23.139]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:27.101]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:33:02.429 --> 00:33:07.574]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.255 --> 00:33:10.537]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:21.033 --> 00:33:23.754]  Monday through Friday from eleven to two central.
[00:33:24.954 --> 00:33:26.094]  Back from nine to midnight.
[00:33:26.454 --> 00:33:27.854]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.894 --> 00:33:28.735]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:33:30.195 --> 00:33:36.676]  Okay, coming up I'm going to get into House Bill would enforce Patriot Act secrecy clause.
[00:33:37.776 --> 00:33:42.877]  Activists cry foul in electronic voting in America.
[00:33:44.518 --> 00:33:50.079]  VP Dick Cheney has set a standard for war profiteering that others can only dream about.
[00:33:51.750 --> 00:34:07.376]  Weeks old babies can walk, smile, yawn, rub their eyes thanks to the new 3D imaging ultrasounds they have, which, this is from the BBC, while the FDA moves to ban these.
[00:34:07.396 --> 00:34:07.997]  Did you know that?
[00:34:08.397 --> 00:34:10.137]  They don't want you looking at your babies.
[00:34:10.378 --> 00:34:21.302]  They're not even saying it's bad for you, but they don't want you going and going to one of these medical institutions and seeing this because they don't want people to see that it's a human being, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:22.980]  And we'll get to that article.
[00:34:24.921 --> 00:34:28.662]  This also, Israel, major supplier of arms to Beijing.
[00:34:29.122 --> 00:34:30.023]  Why are they doing that?
[00:34:30.043 --> 00:34:32.083]  Because China then sells it to the Arabs.
[00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:37.445]  Foreign hands behind Iraq blast, experts say.
[00:34:38.685 --> 00:34:42.447]  The latest beheading and the latest killing of another soldier.
[00:34:43.927 --> 00:34:49.769]  Also, right to petition lawsuit dismissed by federal court in California on the Second Amendment.
[00:34:51.465 --> 00:34:58.617]  Just a lot of really, really important news and new developments of what we covered last week.
[00:34:59.538 --> 00:35:05.769]  The new project called New Freedom to forcibly test every child and adult for mental illness.
[00:35:07.043 --> 00:35:11.366]  And then to force-drug the population, this out of the new standard.
[00:35:12.186 --> 00:35:17.229]  White House may be planning nationwide program to diagnose and drug kids.
[00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:20.811]  And you read into the actual article, it's adults as well.
[00:35:21.032 --> 00:35:22.152]  Very chilling stuff.
[00:35:23.653 --> 00:35:27.515]  Also, fueling suspicion, the coalition in Iraq's oil billions.
[00:35:28.136 --> 00:35:31.498]  Coalition caught stealing more billions just like Kofi Annan did.
[00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:41.845]  Just a ton of vital news coming up, but right now let's go ahead and take a call from Virginia.
[00:35:43.366 --> 00:35:45.027]  Caller from Virginia, what's your name?
[00:35:45.287 --> 00:35:46.408]  My name is Maureen.
[00:35:46.928 --> 00:35:47.969]  Maureen, good to talk to you.
[00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:48.309]  Welcome.
[00:35:48.729 --> 00:36:02.278]  Hey, I'm wondering when you're talking about all the things that Bush is doing that appear to be so insane, I wonder if he's trying to build up an insanity defense with all the information that's coming out
[00:36:03.129 --> 00:36:05.150]  Lord knows he deserves the death penalty.
[00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:09.152]  Maybe he just is trying to make people think he's insane.
[00:36:10.093 --> 00:36:15.596]  But that reason... Well, ma'am, let me state unequivocally that I wish no harm upon the person of the President.
[00:36:17.077 --> 00:36:17.537]  You know what?
[00:36:18.537 --> 00:36:19.638]  We're a nation of laws.
[00:36:20.198 --> 00:36:30.884]  If he's a traitor, if he's a treasonous, if he has killed a whole bunch of people by his complicity in 9-1-1, I don't wish any harm upon any innocent party.
[00:36:31.524 --> 00:36:32.565]  But that wasn't why I called.
[00:36:32.944 --> 00:36:37.265]  I called because I wanted to give out my website with you talking about the draft, if you don't mind.
[00:36:37.425 --> 00:36:37.685]  Sure.
[00:36:38.085 --> 00:36:44.366]  It's drafted into slavery.com and I would beg people.
[00:36:44.966 --> 00:36:49.047]  It seems like everyone thinks somebody else is going to do something, so nobody does it.
[00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:53.248]  Well, you know, that's a fabulous website name.
[00:36:54.788 --> 00:36:55.768]  My husband thought of that.
[00:36:55.828 --> 00:36:59.749]  I had a lot of really cruel ones like, who the heck do they think they are?
[00:37:00.396 --> 00:37:02.618]  I was just saying nasty things about the politicians.
[00:37:02.678 --> 00:37:19.711]  Well, there's a lot of people who have wonderful websites, but it's got a name like squiggly bob tilde double q five niner eight seven q underscore w dash one eight seven five niner four three hey Alex let me get the rest out of it on air seven five niner four three x q five seven eight
[00:37:20.251 --> 00:37:21.952]  Hopscotch 9, please!
[00:37:21.992 --> 00:37:22.572]  Q4 Niner!
[00:37:22.972 --> 00:37:25.213]  And I'm going, listen, you gotta get a better name.
[00:37:25.673 --> 00:37:32.135]  That's the key, so when you call into talk shows or tell your neighbors, it's all about short and sweet, and that's a great name.
[00:37:32.535 --> 00:37:42.098]  Basically, I would beg people, if you have any decency in you, if you care about your children, call your Congress.
[00:37:42.378 --> 00:37:44.339]  Call your Senators and your Representatives.
[00:37:44.679 --> 00:37:45.179]  Tell them you
[00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:46.550]  Have you?
[00:38:00.399 --> 00:38:02.041]  Then don't keep calling them every day.
[00:38:02.361 --> 00:38:04.263]  But until then, call them every day.
[00:38:04.763 --> 00:38:05.844]  Tie their time up.
[00:38:06.364 --> 00:38:07.425]  Tie their lines up.
[00:38:07.445 --> 00:38:11.929]  Well, Maureen, for those who just joined us, I'm sure your call was spurred by the first article I covered.
[00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:14.772]  Army plans and voluntary call-up of thousands.
[00:38:15.132 --> 00:38:23.540]  It's already been happening, but these are the people who've already served, already volunteered years, decades in some cases,
[00:38:24.855 --> 00:38:26.637]  And they've already started this with some troops.
[00:38:26.677 --> 00:38:27.598]  Now they're going to expand it.
[00:38:27.859 --> 00:38:29.581]  And they say, sorry, you can't leave.
[00:38:29.881 --> 00:38:31.263]  You didn't read the fine print.
[00:38:32.104 --> 00:38:35.528]  Now, how can a neocon, a chicken hawk, who's never even served...
[00:38:36.343 --> 00:38:44.008]  Or served in some silver spoon regiment during wartime, and didn't show up half the time, and was drunk, and was AWOL for two years.
[00:38:44.529 --> 00:38:46.410]  How can they call these people bad?
[00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:50.473]  Who were saying, no, I signed up for five years, you can't make me stay another two!
[00:38:50.493 --> 00:38:53.095]  I mean, how can we do that?
[00:38:53.375 --> 00:38:55.216]  This is the worst type of draft!
[00:38:55.697 --> 00:38:57.418]  Of people who've already served!
[00:38:57.918 --> 00:39:01.881]  I mean, in Vietnam they only made you serve, you know, ten, eleven months, a tour.
[00:39:02.261 --> 00:39:04.723]  They didn't make you serve three, four, five years!
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:12.962]  If the people don't rise up and speak up, they're going to keep on doing whatever they darn well please.
[00:39:13.882 --> 00:39:15.702]  We have to call Congress.
[00:39:16.082 --> 00:39:20.383]  We have to go to the meetings that they have, you know, in their little areas.
[00:39:20.803 --> 00:39:23.824]  We need to be very vocal.
[00:39:24.064 --> 00:39:24.484]  I hear you.
[00:39:24.664 --> 00:39:24.924]  I hear you.
[00:39:24.984 --> 00:39:25.745]  I appreciate the call.
[00:39:25.825 --> 00:39:26.625]  Good job.
[00:39:27.265 --> 00:39:32.126]  Yeah, there's so many wonderful websites and they've got addresses 14 million feet long
[00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:39.835]  I would challenge everybody out there, if you've got a good website, go spend $15 and buy a good name.
[00:39:40.915 --> 00:39:42.316]  Re-register your website.
[00:39:43.537 --> 00:39:46.539]  Get it off of wherever you've got it, where nobody can see it.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.721]  That's just my recommendation.
[00:39:50.382 --> 00:39:51.703]  But side issue there.
[00:39:53.378 --> 00:39:56.339]  Uh, but still the general public's in denial about the draft.
[00:39:56.419 --> 00:39:58.199]  Anything that's threatening to their little world.
[00:39:58.279 --> 00:39:59.100]  Nope, doesn't exist.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:39:59.600]  Not true.
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:03.401]  Until it's too late, then you'll have to live under it because you were in denial.
[00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:05.361]  Uh, Vince in Indiana.
[00:40:05.381 --> 00:40:06.181]  Vince, go ahead, sir.
[00:40:06.821 --> 00:40:07.542]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:40:07.582 --> 00:40:08.082]  How are you?
[00:40:08.202 --> 00:40:08.882]  Good, my friend.
[00:40:09.502 --> 00:40:13.663]  I went to a thing called a Freedom Fest about a couple months ago out in Las Vegas.
[00:40:14.563 --> 00:40:14.783]  Okay.
[00:40:14.803 --> 00:40:21.225]  I heard that James Boulevard, you know, he wrote, he's written a book called Parody and Terrorism.
[00:40:22.293 --> 00:40:26.434]  And they fest for justice and peace and the trampling of our freedom.
[00:40:27.855 --> 00:40:29.135]  And let me tell you something.
[00:40:29.956 --> 00:40:37.878]  When I got off the plane there in Las Vegas, this Homeland Security screener asked me where I was going.
[00:40:38.639 --> 00:40:41.179]  I said, well, I'm just going to see the town of Las Vegas.
[00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:48.902]  I didn't specifically tell him where I was going, but he didn't like the tone of my answer.
[00:40:50.725 --> 00:40:56.370]  You know, when I said I'm not a physically imposing, you know, I'm a big person that's not going to do anything wrong.
[00:40:56.450 --> 00:41:03.475]  I was with several other people, but I came to find out, you know, listen to James Bond, Mark, that they could have fined me for that.
[00:41:03.495 --> 00:41:08.319]  They could have detained me and fined me for that statement.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.101]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:10.181 --> 00:41:15.025]  In fact, I have seen conservatively, I don't know, 70, 80 articles where
[00:41:17.566 --> 00:41:22.089]  Where you don't cuss, you're not even rude, you just say, hey, what's the problem?
[00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:29.875]  And they will slam you to the ground, take you back, and then fine you, or in some cases, criminally charge you.
[00:41:29.895 --> 00:41:41.003]  There have been confirmed cases of pregnant women having to take their clothes off in front of hundreds of people out in the open, and then a man complains and they arrest him.
[00:41:41.023 --> 00:41:46.027]  There have been cases of members of the media, you know,
[00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:49.252]  The screeners say, what's on this tape?
[00:41:49.292 --> 00:41:50.112]  What's on this film?
[00:41:50.152 --> 00:41:52.354]  Well, I'm with the local CBS affiliate.
[00:41:52.374 --> 00:41:53.135]  What do you think, Sonny?
[00:41:53.635 --> 00:41:54.036]  That's it!
[00:41:54.156 --> 00:41:54.796]  Arrest him!
[00:41:55.457 --> 00:42:08.707]  So it's all selectively enforced, and now they're going to have these same low-grade moron goons, they're going to have them running security at the trains, the checkpoints on the roads, the malls.
[00:42:09.308 --> 00:42:14.612]  Chuckie Schumer, last week, introducing a bill to put in airport-style security at the malls.
[00:42:15.033 --> 00:42:16.594]  Again, training us how to be slaves.
[00:42:18.231 --> 00:42:20.892]  And that's the sad thing, because this is James Boulevard.
[00:42:21.672 --> 00:42:28.973]  He said the same thing, you know, that we're kind of, we're now into this nice evolution of a police state.
[00:42:29.173 --> 00:42:29.633]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:42:29.673 --> 00:42:30.233]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:30.273 --> 00:42:31.414]  It's been all over the news, sir.
[00:42:32.554 --> 00:42:33.354]  All over the news.
[00:42:33.674 --> 00:42:37.815]  I mean, there was a guy, I keep using this example, but I see one every two or three days.
[00:42:38.675 --> 00:42:42.436]  But a British businessman, no criminal record, blonde hair, blue eyes.
[00:42:42.836 --> 00:42:47.917]  And I say that because imagine how bad it is if you're a person with a little bit of, you know, melanin to your skin.
[00:42:48.610 --> 00:42:50.592]  You've done nothing wrong, but you've got a tanned skin.
[00:42:50.612 --> 00:42:51.472]  You're really in trouble.
[00:42:52.473 --> 00:42:58.798]  But this guy had an outstanding thing on his credit out.
[00:42:59.298 --> 00:43:04.042]  Supposedly he hadn't paid $2,000 on a car he'd bought 10 years ago.
[00:43:05.103 --> 00:43:12.969]  He was arrested, put in wooden restraints, a type of stock, for 24 plus hours.
[00:43:13.429 --> 00:43:15.911]  They ate hamburgers in front of him, laughed at him.
[00:43:15.951 --> 00:43:16.692]  This was all admitted.
[00:43:17.712 --> 00:43:20.673]  This is mainstream news.
[00:43:20.693 --> 00:43:27.134]  And then it came back that, oops, he really had paid for the credit.
[00:43:27.214 --> 00:43:28.235]  He had paid for the car.
[00:43:28.895 --> 00:43:30.655]  So, see, that's Caps 2, folks.
[00:43:31.235 --> 00:43:35.056]  Haven't paid a credit.
[00:43:35.136 --> 00:43:39.337]  And type in Caps 2 credit report into search engines.
[00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:40.358]  It'll pop up.
[00:43:40.678 --> 00:43:42.098]  Your credit is looked at.
[00:43:43.518 --> 00:43:44.799]  I mean, folks, I've got to be honest with you.
[00:43:44.819 --> 00:43:46.179]  I've got a couple slow pays.
[00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:50.161]  Or I get so busy, I forget to pay a mortgage, I forget to pay a car payment.
[00:43:50.561 --> 00:43:53.303]  Just for a couple weeks late, you get a slow pay?
[00:43:53.323 --> 00:43:54.823]  I got a couple of those.
[00:43:54.843 --> 00:44:02.726]  They're almost off my credit now, but you know, you go to buy a new car and they go, oops, sorry, your interest rate's going to be a lot higher because you had a slow pay five years ago.
[00:44:03.547 --> 00:44:05.427]  I mean, I got pretty good credit, folks.
[00:44:05.848 --> 00:44:08.989]  So instead of zero percent, you know, interest rate, you get .5 or whatever.
[00:44:09.369 --> 00:44:14.351]  But imagine what it's like for somebody who got sent all those credit cards when they were a teenager.
[00:44:15.091 --> 00:44:19.974]  By the way, now that I have a little bit of money, I don't get sent credit cards, because I don't have any credit cards.
[00:44:21.155 --> 00:44:30.762]  But back when I was in college, and was absolutely broke, you know, working two jobs, I got a credit card every week.
[00:44:30.962 --> 00:44:34.384]  Sometimes, I'd open the mailbox, and there'd be three credit cards in there.
[00:44:34.624 --> 00:44:36.005]  But on average, it was about one a week.
[00:44:38.587 --> 00:44:40.909]  And you've been approved for $2,000, Mr. Jones, but as soon as I'm
[00:44:43.659 --> 00:44:49.804]  Out of debt, predominantly, and as soon as I don't have credit cards, cut them up years ago, I don't get them sent to me.
[00:44:51.586 --> 00:44:56.470]  In fact, I kept one visa and never used it.
[00:44:56.490 --> 00:44:57.691]  It was for emergencies.
[00:44:58.452 --> 00:45:04.077]  I guess three or four years ago I get a letter going, we're dropping you because you don't hold a balance.
[00:45:05.953 --> 00:45:09.615]  I mean, I just had the visa in case my debit card didn't work, which I don't use a lot.
[00:45:09.655 --> 00:45:10.455]  I usually use cash.
[00:45:10.775 --> 00:45:17.238]  You know, just to back up forms of money, of cashless society control grids information.
[00:45:19.999 --> 00:45:20.359]  I don't know.
[00:45:20.439 --> 00:45:23.161]  It's just now your credit is going to affect you.
[00:45:23.241 --> 00:45:34.846]  Reggie said it's going to be on your national ID card, which you'll call your state driver's license, federally mandated, federal setup, with your card, really a federal ID card.
[00:45:35.831 --> 00:45:44.017]  And if you've got bad credit, and you try to get a job, you're going to have a yellow level on that card, what Ridge said.
[00:45:44.918 --> 00:45:49.321]  Because statistically, somebody who's got bad credit is more likely to be a criminal or a terrorist.
[00:45:49.381 --> 00:45:53.424]  And, you know, criminals cause crime and undermine the state, which aids the terrorist.
[00:45:53.724 --> 00:45:55.205]  Hence, all crime is terror.
[00:45:55.505 --> 00:46:03.451]  And because statistically, having bad credit means you might commit crimes, statistically, then you can't have a green-level job.
[00:46:03.491 --> 00:46:05.292]  And a green-level job is taxi driver,
[00:46:06.064 --> 00:46:09.525]  Bus driver, food service, agricultural worker.
[00:46:10.145 --> 00:46:11.366]  This is the stuff they're listing.
[00:46:11.706 --> 00:46:12.966]  Folks, you think I'm joking?
[00:46:16.148 --> 00:46:16.608]  Oh, man.
[00:46:18.128 --> 00:46:19.229]  Again, I'm just going to say it again.
[00:46:20.929 --> 00:46:21.850]  We knew it was going to happen.
[00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:30.393]  The Supreme Court comes out yesterday and says, we can secretly arrest citizens for any section under Section 802, any misdemeanor.
[00:46:31.233 --> 00:46:34.314]  You can secretly be held and you get no trial, no lawyer.
[00:46:35.379 --> 00:46:41.762]  Then there's this weird pause about, but you can complain to the Judge Advocate General, you can complain to the prison you're being held in.
[00:46:43.243 --> 00:46:54.569]  That's like, you know, a Pole or somebody who's been grabbed by the Nazis in Poland, and they go, oh, you've been secretly grabbed in the middle of the night, but you can complain to the Commandant.
[00:46:54.589 --> 00:46:58.091]  You know, that's your freedom.
[00:46:58.775 --> 00:47:00.236]  I mean, it's such doublespeak.
[00:47:00.276 --> 00:47:02.296]  Again, we've given Iraq freedom.
[00:47:02.316 --> 00:47:03.497]  We've put more troops in.
[00:47:04.517 --> 00:47:06.658]  The new president says he's going to declare martial law.
[00:47:07.038 --> 00:47:08.339]  Our government appointed him.
[00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:11.880]  He's surrounded by special forces with machine guns.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.161]  We run all the prisons, run everything, but it's freedom!
[00:47:16.442 --> 00:47:22.964]  If the Russians came here and took out the Congress and then appointed a new Congress, that would be democracy.
[00:47:24.205 --> 00:47:25.125]  Much less a republic.
[00:47:25.505 --> 00:47:27.206]  I mean, no, that's a fraud.
[00:47:28.627 --> 00:47:32.430]  And it's the same thing with all this other stuff, you know?
[00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:42.878]  It's just, oh, we can secretly arrest you and secretly hold you and give you no trial, but in a blow to the Bush administration, you can complain to secret federal judges.
[00:47:43.298 --> 00:47:44.359]  Oh, wow!
[00:47:44.859 --> 00:47:46.060]  Oh, my goodness!
[00:47:46.941 --> 00:47:48.682]  Man, that really showed Bush!
[00:47:50.324 --> 00:47:51.324]  Danny in Tennessee.
[00:47:51.344 --> 00:47:51.965]  Danny, go ahead.
[00:47:52.839 --> 00:47:58.360]  Alex, hey, I've got some news about the draft, but first I wanted to comment real fast.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:02.281]  I watched George Humphrey's video on Prison Planet TV last night.
[00:48:02.661 --> 00:48:03.101]  Oh, great!
[00:48:03.401 --> 00:48:14.703]  With my wife, and I've been researching the New World Order for several years, and Black Magic Satanism, and trying to learn my enemies, and after we watched that movie, we literally wept for about an hour.
[00:48:14.723 --> 00:48:21.244]  I mean, I was just so overwhelmed by the evil in our society,
[00:48:22.287 --> 00:48:26.029]  How people think it's good, and it's good when Iraqi children are killed.
[00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:31.312]  Just a really eye-opening video, and people need to check that out.
[00:48:32.492 --> 00:48:32.813]  Well done.
[00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:41.697]  Well, it's on PrisonPlanet.tv for members, but you can buy a VHS or DVD copy at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com right now, folks.
[00:48:42.378 --> 00:48:46.660]  One copy is $19.95 with a free 80-plus page color booklet
[00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:53.912]  Well, I had been doing some research to see when the war crime immunity ended, and of course it ended July 1st, 2004, the day after we were supposed to hand over, and I called my Senator
[00:49:17.578 --> 00:49:33.938]  Um, from where I live here in Tennessee, and we were talking about the draft, and he told me that Donald Rumsfeld has already been given the authority by Congress to conscript 20,000 people and that they were going to add a battalion to every single division in armed forces.
[00:49:35.345 --> 00:49:40.289]  I mean, a battalion, you know, you're looking at 1,000 to 2,000 people added to every single division.
[00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:41.590]  Well, it's a lot more than 20,000.
[00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:47.334]  They're talking about this new draft being 2 to 4 million in the first round.
[00:49:47.854 --> 00:49:48.175]  Right.
[00:49:49.035 --> 00:49:49.676]  Ha, ha, ha!
[00:49:50.116 --> 00:49:53.278]  Yeah, it's just, it's scary, I mean.
[00:49:53.298 --> 00:49:55.720]  So, who did you talk to that said that?
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.382]  I spoke to Senator Alexander's office.
[00:49:59.283 --> 00:50:02.005]  And they told me, I spoke to their Washington, D.C.
[00:50:02.085 --> 00:50:02.345]  office.
[00:50:02.465 --> 00:50:03.406]  They were telling me about that.
[00:50:04.485 --> 00:50:09.068]  Well, I think they're calling a conscription by calling people up who've served their terms already.
[00:50:09.428 --> 00:50:11.430]  Right, yeah.
[00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:17.994]  If you go in for four years, you have to spend eight years in the inactive reserve.
[00:50:18.604 --> 00:50:19.505]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:50:19.525 --> 00:50:21.085]  They're calling people up out of that.
[00:50:21.165 --> 00:50:22.926]  Which is, you know... Well, it's more than that.
[00:50:22.966 --> 00:50:27.349]  There's also a clause that they can, you know, re-up you regardless, even after the eight years.
[00:50:27.809 --> 00:50:29.310]  Yeah, it's just horrible.
[00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:33.953]  I mean... Look, I've read the articles where people served, you know, 12, 14 years and they're leaving.
[00:50:33.973 --> 00:50:35.754]  And they go, nope, can't leave, another two years.
[00:50:36.334 --> 00:50:37.775]  Yeah, it's just awful.
[00:50:37.815 --> 00:50:40.516]  Hey, look, even in Vietnam, after a year, they got you out of there.
[00:50:40.536 --> 00:50:42.437]  People can't handle the stress that long.
[00:50:44.158 --> 00:50:45.039]  It destroys them.
[00:50:45.675 --> 00:50:48.518]  And we're gonna keep him in there two, three years and I rock a piece.
[00:50:48.558 --> 00:50:49.139]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.701]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[00:50:51.041 --> 00:50:52.242]  We'll come back, take more calls.
[00:50:52.262 --> 00:50:53.564]  Got a guest coming up as well.
[00:50:53.584 --> 00:50:54.024]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.593 --> 00:51:03.095]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.275 --> 00:51:06.358]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.499 --> 00:51:10.383]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:14.728]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.028 --> 00:51:18.812]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.953 --> 00:51:20.755]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.335 --> 00:51:24.218]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.278 --> 00:51:29.003]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.163 --> 00:51:32.206]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.386 --> 00:51:35.289]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:41.856]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.376 --> 00:51:46.157]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:02.724 --> 00:52:06.847]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:06.947 --> 00:52:09.829]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:09.909 --> 00:52:16.634]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:16.815 --> 00:52:19.817]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.037 --> 00:52:22.419]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:22.539 --> 00:52:27.283]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:27.483 --> 00:52:42.016]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Apcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[00:52:42.176 --> 00:52:48.822]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today, and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at

[00:53:46.681 --> 00:53:49.783]  We've been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:49.944 --> 00:53:55.908]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:53:55.928 --> 00:54:09.679]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here back live.
[00:54:16.329 --> 00:54:19.192]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[00:54:21.974 --> 00:54:25.437]  Let's go ahead now and go to Dave.
[00:54:26.198 --> 00:54:27.359]  Dave, where are you calling us from?
[00:54:27.379 --> 00:54:29.260]  How are you doing Alex, calling from Philadelphia.
[00:54:29.641 --> 00:54:30.662]  Good my friend, welcome.
[00:54:31.702 --> 00:54:33.964]  Listen Alex, I just wanted to thank you for waking me up yesterday.
[00:54:34.785 --> 00:54:36.907]  I stumbled upon your website through other means.
[00:54:38.874 --> 00:54:50.079]  I'd just like to say that convince me I went out and bought my first gun today because I see what this world is coming to and I realize my right to bear arms is probably going to eventually try to be taken away from me so I figured I better take advantage of it right now.
[00:54:51.428 --> 00:54:52.669]  Well, you know, that's a good thing.
[00:54:52.709 --> 00:55:02.914]  I've said that many times, that I don't want to offensively go out and use guns against anybody unless they're breaking into my house, you know, a common thug or a Nazi, a black ski mask Nazi.
[00:55:03.014 --> 00:55:07.616]  But the mere fact that we're armed is an insurance policy against tyranny.
[00:55:07.636 --> 00:55:09.637]  If they had our guns, they would have already moved.
[00:55:10.278 --> 00:55:10.618]  Exactly.
[00:55:10.658 --> 00:55:13.479]  I was never armed before, and you woke me up.
[00:55:13.559 --> 00:55:14.380]  I had to be armed now.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.101]  I went out this morning and purchased my first gun.
[00:55:17.061 --> 00:55:20.483]  And I'd like to make a second comment about George Bush and his approach to Christianity.
[00:55:21.164 --> 00:55:21.464]  Yes.
[00:55:22.345 --> 00:55:27.109]  How can he be a Christian when he allows federal judges to remove every person's symbol that's in the United States?
[00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:42.382]  Well, not only did Bush not help Judge Roy Moore in Alabama with the Ten Commandments situation, debacle, but he then promoted to a federal judgeship the Attorney General of that state that went after Judge Roy Moore.
[00:55:42.882 --> 00:55:43.243]  Exactly.
[00:55:43.263 --> 00:55:45.024]  But again, we're supposed to ignore that too.
[00:55:45.224 --> 00:55:48.307]  Right, and he wants to wear it on his lapel like we're all supposed to bow down to him.
[00:55:49.099 --> 00:55:53.942]  And I'd like to ask you one question, and maybe everybody else could wake up and go to this.
[00:55:54.522 --> 00:56:02.126]  What can one person with their voice do to get, I mean, do we need to have an organized resistance?
[00:56:02.286 --> 00:56:03.687]  Or can you really just use your voice?
[00:56:03.727 --> 00:56:08.769]  Because if you just use your voice, I mean, won't they just knock you down, charge you with something, put you away?
[00:56:08.889 --> 00:56:12.011]  Okay, number one, there's only 650,000 police, that counts federal,
[00:56:14.922 --> 00:56:17.183]  Most of the military has woken up and is on our side.
[00:56:17.223 --> 00:56:18.644]  A lot of police are good people.
[00:56:18.984 --> 00:56:22.865]  It's the people in command that are bad, trying to sell us on this police state tyranny.
[00:56:24.426 --> 00:56:26.947]  This is a war of the mind, an info war.
[00:56:27.347 --> 00:56:29.247]  Most of it is not physical, it's mental.
[00:56:29.808 --> 00:56:30.648]  It's psychological.
[00:56:31.388 --> 00:56:40.952]  And so you have to educate people about the crimes of this government, the ruthless things this government's done, whether it's John Kerry or George Bush or Hillary Clinton, they're all puppets.
[00:56:41.493 --> 00:56:43.093]  You've got to just expose that.
[00:56:43.614 --> 00:56:54.679]  And if you wake up twenty people in the next year, and they wake up twenty people, and they wake up twenty people, I mean, one person can do so much, but you can't think that you're going to save the world by yourself.
[00:56:54.999 --> 00:56:59.421]  With God's help, it's all of us doing a little something every day, informing somebody,
[00:57:00.181 --> 00:57:02.822]  Giving people out of this system and to be conscious of it.
[00:57:03.422 --> 00:57:04.743]  Well, thank you Alex.
[00:57:04.763 --> 00:57:07.304]  You woke me up and I've already woken up a few of my friends.
[00:57:07.904 --> 00:57:14.206]  And me and my girlfriend were out here last night watching your video on InfoWars.com and she had to leave the room.
[00:57:14.226 --> 00:57:15.126]  She was so terrified.
[00:57:15.526 --> 00:57:20.588]  I mean, it's unbelievably shocking to think that our lives are
[00:57:21.158 --> 00:57:25.485]  Well, they are, and that's actually what elites have done throughout history.
[00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:26.447]  That's the norm.
[00:57:26.807 --> 00:57:29.372]  But somehow they convince us that, oh no, that isn't the norm.
[00:57:29.392 --> 00:57:30.473]  In fact, that's impossible.
[00:57:30.714 --> 00:57:31.796]  Governments only do good.
[00:57:31.816 --> 00:57:32.437]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:33.092 --> 00:57:34.512]  Good to have you on board, my friend.
[00:57:35.133 --> 00:57:37.994]  And by the way, if you want to see these videos that are waking up so many people.
[00:57:38.034 --> 00:57:40.034]  This guy woke up yesterday seeing one of them online.
[00:57:40.594 --> 00:57:48.997]  Go to PrisonPlanet.tv and sign up for 15 cents a day to watch all my films and other films and weekly TV reports and the best audio interviews from this broadcast.
[00:57:49.517 --> 00:57:59.360]  PrisonPlanet.tv or go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order VHS or DVD copies of my films or other films that are just so good, so informative.
[00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:10.104]  There's a total free number to order my videos or the books I carry or the book I've written.
[00:58:10.124 --> 00:58:10.784]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:10.844 --> 00:58:11.864]  What's stopping you folks?
[00:58:12.144 --> 00:58:13.385]  You want a tool to wake people up?
[00:58:13.805 --> 00:58:15.545]  These videos have proven they can do it.
[00:58:15.565 --> 00:58:18.006]  A lot of new stuff on the website as well.
[00:58:18.086 --> 00:58:18.346]  So, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:25.094 --> 00:58:28.176]  Our videos are all over two hours long, $25.95 a piece.
[00:58:28.456 --> 00:58:31.078]  Some of the other videos I cover are $19.95 that I sell.
[00:58:31.618 --> 00:58:35.120]  But if you order three or more of any of my videos, they drop down to $20 a piece.
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:36.101]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:36.121 --> 00:58:45.486]  All that evil men and tyrants need to flourish is that good men and women do nothing.
[00:58:46.307 --> 00:58:49.889]  All right, we've got a guest coming up who will also be taking your call.
[00:58:49.909 --> 00:58:50.289]  Stay with us.
[00:58:58.144 --> 00:58:58.785]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.445 --> 00:59:00.526]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.206 --> 00:59:02.327]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.968 --> 00:59:03.808]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:05.510]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.773]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.293 --> 00:59:14.396]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:31.317]  Alright folks, we're now into our number two of his worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:59:32.558 --> 00:59:40.784]  And we're scheduled to have Phil Jahan on from 911letsroll.org here in a second to go over his website and some of the things he covers.
[00:59:40.884 --> 00:59:43.326]  We're also going to continue with your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:47.807 --> 00:59:48.107]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:48.367 --> 00:59:54.971]  We'll go to your calls early in this hour for Bob and others that are patiently holding.
[00:59:56.212 --> 01:00:00.975]  And again, the websites are PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:00:02.976 --> 01:00:08.720]  Some of the other news that I want to go over just briefly is this first.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:13.583]  House Bill would enforce Patriot Act secrecy clause.
[01:00:13.623 --> 01:00:15.264]  This is out of the news standard.
[01:00:17.069 --> 01:00:32.998]  And it says, uh, even as the government increasingly comes under fire from civil libertarians for using Patriot Act provisions to seek personal information without probable cause, some lawmakers are working to expand those powers.
[01:00:33.558 --> 01:00:37.380]  Why is every article I've ever read say civil libertarians?
[01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:38.801]  It's people who love freedom.
[01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:40.622]  People who don't want their rights crampled.
[01:00:40.642 --> 01:00:41.602]  People who don't want to be slaves.
[01:00:41.822 --> 01:00:42.723]  How about citizens?
[01:00:42.763 --> 01:00:44.564]  But it's always this tiny little group.
[01:00:45.592 --> 01:01:01.100]  It says, in recent months, signs of public outrage have begun to surface over the FBI's use of national security letters to secretly demand information from businesses and public agencies about their clientele under one of the most controversial sections of the USA Patriot Act.
[01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:09.624]  Third-party record holders who receive NSLs requesting information about their patrons are forbidden from telling anyone about the letter.
[01:01:10.344 --> 01:01:14.066]  Well, it's like the ACLU sued Ashcroft
[01:01:15.564 --> 01:01:27.311]  Over the Patriot Act, secretly going into bookstores, businesses, getting records and threatening people with arrest under terrorism if they tell anybody that they were searched without a warrant, by the way.
[01:01:27.331 --> 01:01:31.673]  These are just blanket, you know, search whoever you want, blank checks.
[01:01:32.533 --> 01:01:36.376]  Well, then they were blocked from disclosing their lawsuit!
[01:01:37.116 --> 01:01:38.497]  And then, of course, it got leaked.
[01:01:39.497 --> 01:01:41.018]  But now you sue the government?
[01:01:41.458 --> 01:01:44.180]  And they say, oh, you're blocked from telling anyone you're suing us.
[01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.437]  I mean, how is that terrorism?
[01:01:47.477 --> 01:01:49.318]  How are they protecting us that way?
[01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:51.859]  It's just absolutely amazing.
[01:01:51.879 --> 01:01:52.760]  We'll go more over this.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.180]  Do we have our guest host, Daphne?
[01:01:55.361 --> 01:01:55.921]  Fabulous.
[01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:59.543]  Phil Jahan has a popular website.
[01:01:59.683 --> 01:02:08.408]  It's 911letsroll.org and we've covered a lot of what's been posted on the site.
[01:02:08.468 --> 01:02:09.428]  I agree with quite a bit of it.
[01:02:11.227 --> 01:02:34.300]  Some, I guess, have taken it as criticism that on the subject of the Pentagon, on the subject of missile pods on the aircraft, I have simply said, and I sell videos that cover this, folks, and I put stories up every week about it, but I've just simply said that, yes, I focus on that, but I also focus on all the other concrete evidence that cannot be debated.
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:40.223]  I think we should cover it all, and that's all I've said on the subject, and then some have taken that as criticism out there.
[01:02:40.843 --> 01:02:47.009]  Yeah, but no, I think Phil Jahan's doing some good work and we're honored to have him on the broadcast with us.
[01:02:47.609 --> 01:02:48.590]  Phil, good to be here.
[01:02:48.850 --> 01:02:49.531]  It's good to have you.
[01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:50.572]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:02:50.652 --> 01:02:51.313]  It's good to be here.
[01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:51.713]  How are you?
[01:02:52.234 --> 01:02:52.434]  Good.
[01:02:52.454 --> 01:02:54.215]  Your voice is doing better than it was yesterday.
[01:02:54.235 --> 01:02:55.476]  A lot better.
[01:02:56.057 --> 01:03:01.262]  I was getting you set up for the show yesterday and you sounded like you were having a... You've been a busy beaver, have you not?
[01:03:01.282 --> 01:03:04.164]  Yeah, I've been on the East Coast for the last three or four weeks.
[01:03:04.985 --> 01:03:06.046]  You know, I went up to ground zero.
[01:03:06.721 --> 01:03:12.704]  And, you know, I spent time down at Ground Zero talking to people there and trying to find new evidence and things like that.
[01:03:12.724 --> 01:03:22.308]  And after I went to Ground Zero, I came down to Washington and have been basically knocking up and down doors on Embassy Row.
[01:03:24.349 --> 01:03:33.733]  Well, when we get back, I want to go over the missile pods and when you first noticed this and when we first noticed this a year and a half ago and some of the reports you brought forward.
[01:03:34.494 --> 01:03:38.436]  And the slightest info with, you know, do you know?
[01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:39.917]  Do your sources know?
[01:03:39.937 --> 01:03:48.923]  I mean, how do we confirm this of, you know, who one of the pilots was supposedly, reportedly, according to you and others, shooting down Flight 93?
[01:03:49.563 --> 01:03:50.324]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.424 --> 01:03:51.024]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.281 --> 01:03:57.342]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:03:57.562 --> 01:04:00.603]  Don't underestimate the urgency of the need to become self-sufficient.
[01:04:00.743 --> 01:04:06.804]  In our kit, we're sending you 25 pounds of organic red winter wheat, and that's nearly a year of high-potency wheatgrass juice.
[01:04:07.045 --> 01:04:12.246]  The book, Wheatgrass Nature's Finest Medicine, and our beautiful stainless steel wheatgrass juicer.
[01:04:12.466 --> 01:04:24.524]  But most importantly, we are professional wheatgrass growers and I am going to be your contact to walk you through the process of successfully growing your continuing self-supply of full-scale nutrition from pennies worth of grain.
[01:04:24.644 --> 01:04:25.505]  So call 1-877-MY-WHEAT
[01:04:27.888 --> 01:04:30.329]  Or, go to AustinWheatgrass.com.
[01:04:30.549 --> 01:04:36.450]  Growing your own wheatgrass is not as easy as some would have you think, and we've learned this the hard way through five years of growing experience.
[01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:38.611]  And we're going to pass on to you our knowledge.
[01:04:38.751 --> 01:04:40.131]  Don't settle for anything less.
[01:04:40.351 --> 01:04:41.892]  Call me and get the real details.
[01:04:41.912 --> 01:04:42.152]  1-877-MY-WHEAT.
[01:04:42.272 --> 01:04:42.692]  That's 1-877-699-4328.
[01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:47.173]  And as always, we thank you for your support of our labors and of this network.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:57.609]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:04:57.809 --> 01:05:02.158]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:05:05.031 --> 01:05:06.873]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:05:23.513 --> 01:05:34.015]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:05:34.255 --> 01:05:39.636]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:05:40.136 --> 01:05:42.776]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:05:42.796 --> 01:05:43.356]  Recall toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[01:05:52.658 --> 01:05:56.119]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:05:56.399 --> 01:05:59.899]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:59.979 --> 01:06:03.920]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:10.301]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:18.623]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:24.387]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:28.309]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:06:54.427 --> 01:07:00.052]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.939 --> 01:07:16.165]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're now eight minutes and sixteen seconds into this
[01:07:17.438 --> 01:07:18.238]  Second hour.
[01:07:19.338 --> 01:07:24.379]  And again, the websites are PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, and now PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:07:24.419 --> 01:07:27.520]  And we're honored to have Phil Jahan on the broadcast.
[01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:32.641]  A lot of you have called in about his website, 911LetsRoll.org.
[01:07:33.261 --> 01:07:40.042]  I think he's brought up a lot of really important questions and aspects of 9-11 that are very revealing.
[01:07:40.362 --> 01:07:42.883]  And let me just say that
[01:07:43.903 --> 01:07:54.527]  About a year and a half ago, we first began reporting about bizarre structures on the aircraft, and other people simultaneously a year and a half ago were noticing this.
[01:07:55.167 --> 01:08:04.331]  Phil put together just an incredible array of evidence on the subject, whereas we just put up a webpage and wrote a few pages about it in Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos.
[01:08:04.451 --> 01:08:08.252]  Phil has gotten a lot of attention because he's really focused on it.
[01:08:08.853 --> 01:08:12.474]  And he's focused on the Pentagon and some other key issues, which I think is good.
[01:08:14.534 --> 01:08:17.556]  But first, I want to ask Phil Jahan how he got into all of this.
[01:08:18.676 --> 01:08:24.961]  When he started Let's Roll, and then I want to get into what's really going on with Flight 93.
[01:08:25.021 --> 01:08:39.850]  But first off, Phil, tell us about yourself and tell us about how you set up the website and why you decided to focus on these bizarre blisters on the bottom of the aircraft, which airline pilots I've talked to have looked at it.
[01:08:39.870 --> 01:08:42.032]  And I don't even mean the photos on his website, folks.
[01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.294]  Well, my initial awakening was about two or three months after 9-1-1.
[01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:16.775]  And the thing that really got me was just the Air Force not being able to, you know, take these planes out.
[01:09:16.935 --> 01:09:19.576]  It just, it was something that kept gnawing in my mind.
[01:09:20.296 --> 01:09:29.001]  And, you know, I'm kind of ashamed to say it took me so long to see it, but that was the initial step that first got me to, you know, start looking into it.
[01:09:29.841 --> 01:09:39.906]  And as I learned more, you know, I was going through the stuff with the Pentagon, the stuff with the World Trade Centers, and I was convinced that they were right.
[01:09:40.512 --> 01:09:48.196]  But it took such an incredible amount of study to look into it and to study it and to raise plausible deniability.
[01:09:49.357 --> 01:09:58.722]  Along my studies, in research, I found a single video that was made by a gentleman in Germany.
[01:09:58.742 --> 01:10:00.603]  His name is Christian Czech.
[01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:05.486]  And he had put together something from his recording from Spiegel TV.
[01:10:06.307 --> 01:10:08.728]  And that's the green
[01:10:09.712 --> 01:10:13.976]  Greenish video that you see on the front page of letsroll911.org.
[01:10:16.277 --> 01:10:16.918]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:10:16.978 --> 01:10:18.719]  My voice is just really, really bad.
[01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:24.984]  But probably about a year ago, I came across that movie.
[01:10:25.444 --> 01:10:27.726]  And, you know, at first I thought it was a fraud.
[01:10:27.986 --> 01:10:32.149]  I thought that, you know, this has got to be somebody that just, you know, is playing games with people's emotions.
[01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:37.093]  And as I set out to see if there was other footage that would confirm it,
[01:10:37.702 --> 01:10:40.783]  I found five or six different sources that show the same thing.
[01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:44.785]  And I started a thread on another forum.
[01:10:45.645 --> 01:10:52.947]  And the purpose of the thread was to educate myself and to be able to present this to people, to convince them of what happened.
[01:10:52.967 --> 01:10:54.748]  Because I thought it was so simple.
[01:10:55.068 --> 01:11:02.951]  Well, this is a great example of one person starting something on a forum who now has a website that gets millions of visitors a month.
[01:11:03.311 --> 01:11:06.012]  I would guess you get millions of visitors a month.
[01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:07.805]  Oh, I wish, Alex.
[01:11:07.865 --> 01:11:09.085]  That's got to be your website.
[01:11:09.106 --> 01:11:10.807]  Well, we get a lot of calls about your website.
[01:11:10.827 --> 01:11:12.327]  Yeah, we get tens of millions a month.
[01:11:12.367 --> 01:11:14.989]  But I do get a lot of calls about your site.
[01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:16.430]  Well, certainly it's gotten a lot of attention.
[01:11:16.470 --> 01:11:17.651]  I've seen it in some newspapers.
[01:11:18.751 --> 01:11:19.051]  Really?
[01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:19.832]  What newspapers?
[01:11:19.872 --> 01:11:20.672]  That's news to me.
[01:11:21.213 --> 01:11:23.434]  I've seen it mentioned here and there in a few articles, yeah.
[01:11:23.654 --> 01:11:24.334]  That's terrific.
[01:11:25.675 --> 01:11:31.279]  I had, you know, put this thread up so that I could have something to show.
[01:11:31.639 --> 01:11:35.341]  I was calling congressmen and senators' offices and news media outlets.
[01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:50.356]  And I needed something to show them while I was on the phone with them so that they could actually see it or else, you know, it's just some person calling up a stranger saying, hey, there's missiles on this airplane that hit the World Trade Center and it's not very believable unless they can see it.
[01:11:51.316 --> 01:11:56.600]  So I took the evidence and I put it in the thread and that's how I started my journey.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:03.085]  And eventually, you know, I put it up on the website here.
[01:12:04.690 --> 01:12:07.891]  You know, and just developed it so that I would have something to show people.
[01:12:08.311 --> 01:12:13.373]  Well, let's go over what it shows because I went to videos I have.
[01:12:13.613 --> 01:12:22.035]  I went to it and looked at it and certainly there's this big attachment to the bottom of one of the flights.
[01:12:22.155 --> 01:12:22.956]  It's undeniable.
[01:12:23.616 --> 01:12:27.737]  Aircraft pilots and others have looked at it and said, that's not on any plane like that.
[01:12:28.137 --> 01:12:28.897]  What is that?
[01:12:29.618 --> 01:12:30.758]  Clearly that's there.
[01:12:32.059 --> 01:12:35.462]  Clearly there is a flash on the building before the plane hits.
[01:12:35.962 --> 01:12:36.503]  Clearly.
[01:12:36.623 --> 01:12:43.608]  Now my problem with all of this is that it can be debated all day long and people can deny it.
[01:12:43.728 --> 01:12:46.210]  You can't deny that public officials were warned not to fly.
[01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:50.573]  You can't deny FBI paying for houses and cars and credit cards of hijackers.
[01:12:51.013 --> 01:12:53.996]  You can't deny the Bush's flying out the bin Laden's even though they tried to.
[01:12:54.516 --> 01:12:58.119]  But on subjects like this people can
[01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:02.086]  Try to deny it, but let's go over the evidence and what this shows.
[01:13:03.366 --> 01:13:06.528]  Well, I found a lot of new evidence.
[01:13:06.588 --> 01:13:08.408]  I'm not sure the last time that you've been to the site.
[01:13:10.829 --> 01:13:12.390]  I was there last night, but go ahead.
[01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:19.572]  One of the new pieces of evidence we found, we found at hereisnewyork.com.
[01:13:20.412 --> 01:13:22.733]  I'll tell you what, let's start at the beginning though.
[01:13:23.093 --> 01:13:25.634]  The scenario of what you're saying happened, tell us that.
[01:13:26.483 --> 01:13:27.723]  Of how I developed it?
[01:13:27.823 --> 01:13:29.284]  No, we've already gone over that.
[01:13:29.304 --> 01:13:34.445]  I mean, the scenario from the evidence you've got, what you're saying you think happened?
[01:13:35.965 --> 01:13:47.627]  Well, you know, in a nutshell, this aircraft, when it was about 3,000 feet away from the building, maybe 2,500 feet away, started to do some unique things.
[01:13:47.707 --> 01:13:52.508]  I discovered that there's two large fuel
[01:13:53.238 --> 01:14:02.486]  Um, downpours, jet sprays from the bottom of the aircraft would start, you know, maybe, you know, about two or three thousand feet before the building and it's spraying down jet fuel.
[01:14:03.247 --> 01:14:09.492]  Um, probably, you know, this is my own estimate, I'm not a... Well, I mean, I've seen it and certainly something sprang out of the aircraft.
[01:14:09.832 --> 01:14:18.700]  Yeah, and if you look at all the video footage, Alex, the purpose of the fuel was to blur all the videos, you know, that were being taken from the ground.
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.202]  So, you know, all this extra equipment and all this
[01:14:21.741 --> 01:14:22.822]  Yeah, it creates a mirage.
[01:14:40.233 --> 01:14:45.057]  There's also, you know, like you said, a huge extra piece of equipment on the bottom fuselage of the aircraft.
[01:14:45.077 --> 01:14:46.218]  Yeah, that can't be missed.
[01:14:46.598 --> 01:14:47.319]  No, no.
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:51.703]  And... That's not just on one camera shot of it, that's now on several different cameras.
[01:14:52.263 --> 01:15:00.350]  Oh, it's on CNN, it's on Fox, it's on ABC, um, Camera Planet, uh, the New York Times, uh, the L.A.
[01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.731]  Times.
[01:15:00.951 --> 01:15:03.353]  I mean, there's at least six different sources that I know of.
[01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:06.562]  You know, it's definitely there, and it's from all different angles.
[01:15:06.642 --> 01:15:07.823]  It's in every frame.
[01:15:08.824 --> 01:15:11.045]  It's undeniable that there's an extra piece of equipment.
[01:15:11.065 --> 01:15:12.286]  Yeah, I've got footage of it, son.
[01:15:13.486 --> 01:15:18.489]  But right before this aircraft hits the building, it shoots out a missile.
[01:15:19.868 --> 01:15:28.553]  Well, you clearly see a flash under this, what looks like a cruise missile pod, and that's what the cruise missile pods, the external ones, look like on larger jet aircraft.
[01:15:28.993 --> 01:15:30.153]  You've got this thing affixed.
[01:15:30.173 --> 01:15:31.694]  There is a flash at the back.
[01:15:32.154 --> 01:15:36.076]  Then you see something shoot out, clearly, and then an impact ahead of the plane.
[01:15:36.336 --> 01:15:37.757]  And that clearly is on there.
[01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:40.943]  Uh, the question is, uh, why would they do that?
[01:15:40.983 --> 01:15:53.987]  Because we know that they have bombs inside the building from eyewitnesses, seismographs, reports, the building being cleared before, bomb-sniffing dogs being pulled out days before, uh, you know, the public officials, all of this.
[01:15:54.047 --> 01:15:54.967]  We know that!
[01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:57.328]  Why would they need to have missiles on top of it?
[01:15:57.908 --> 01:15:59.648]  Well, I think there's a couple different reasons.
[01:15:59.748 --> 01:16:01.489]  I think there's three reasons.
[01:16:01.509 --> 01:16:05.130]  The first reason, um, goes back to something that Colonel Don DeGranpre
[01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:08.364]  Uh, started right after September 11th.
[01:16:08.824 --> 01:16:17.930]  He was convinced that this plane could not have penetrated this, this hard structure unless there was something helping it in, in some way.
[01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:25.235]  He didn't have the data at the time to understand how the plane was absorbed into the building of those, you know, the building was just made like butter.
[01:16:25.255 --> 01:16:34.061]  Now by that, the plane would be sticking out of it or smash on the face of it and parts of it would go through, but the entire thing like a hot knife through butter.
[01:16:34.441 --> 01:16:34.621]  Yeah.
[01:16:35.103 --> 01:16:35.804]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:16:36.384 --> 01:16:43.609]  And so the purpose of the missile, you know, is to soften up the structure to help absorb the airplane.
[01:16:44.129 --> 01:16:47.511]  Something that we found, Alex, and it's really exciting, you know, we found this two weeks ago.
[01:16:47.571 --> 01:16:56.457]  I went down to Ground Zero with a friend of mine named Deb Simon, and we were just going around talking to people and sharing, you know, I've got a little presentation that I give.
[01:16:56.477 --> 01:16:57.718]  It takes about 90 seconds.
[01:16:58.279 --> 01:17:04.743]  And I go through basically most of the stuff on my website and, you know, go a little bit into the controlled demolition and
[01:17:05.307 --> 01:17:09.449]  You know, usually I get about 90% conversion rate with people.
[01:17:09.909 --> 01:17:14.510]  And it's regardless of partisanship or... Yeah, that's the numbers we get.
[01:17:15.131 --> 01:17:16.491]  Yeah, it's wonderful.
[01:17:16.591 --> 01:17:27.515]  And we were walking around and we were sharing this and we found there was three Chinese ladies that were by the financial bridge selling commemorative photos, albums, and that kind of stuff.
[01:17:28.115 --> 01:17:29.436]  And we were looking for more footage.
[01:17:29.896 --> 01:17:32.317]  So we were looking through the albums and we found a new picture.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:40.863]  This is the crispest, clearest picture that's, you know, as far as I know, that's ever been found of this airplane.
[01:17:41.363 --> 01:17:45.865]  And it's the only picture that I know of that shows the far side of the aircraft, the dark side of the plane.
[01:17:46.706 --> 01:17:57.831]  And this picture also shows that, you know, on the far side of the plane that's farthest away from you, there's an extra bomb that's tucked in between the engine and the pylon.
[01:17:58.631 --> 01:18:00.432]  So not only is there a missile on the right,
[01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:07.694]  But there's also, you know, a bomb, you know, that's attached to the left wing, you know, between the engine and the pylon.
[01:18:08.174 --> 01:18:17.580]  So, you know, I'm convinced that, you know, Colonel, down to Grand Prix was correct, that this aircraft needed, you know, something extra to help it in.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.501]  And that was the purpose of this ordinance.
[01:18:20.181 --> 01:18:23.403]  But I think also the purpose of the ordinance was to help.
[01:18:24.624 --> 01:18:25.424]  This was not Flight 175.
[01:18:26.881 --> 01:18:31.426]  Um, this plane never took off from Logan Air, you know, International Airport looking like this.
[01:18:31.946 --> 01:18:32.647]  It's impossible.
[01:18:32.687 --> 01:18:40.755]  Well, it's funny, because Operation Northwood says they will stage people getting on a plane, land that somewhere else, and then have the drone go in for the attack.
[01:18:41.335 --> 01:18:42.376]  We have an official U.S.
[01:18:42.396 --> 01:18:45.339]  government document describing just these type of activities.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.321]  Cannot ignore this.
[01:18:48.462 --> 01:18:49.583]  Alright, we're delving deep.
[01:18:49.603 --> 01:18:50.244]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.016 --> 01:18:55.617]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:18:55.757 --> 01:18:59.898]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:18:59.999 --> 01:19:02.880]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:09.683]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:19:09.863 --> 01:19:12.864]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:19:13.084 --> 01:19:15.465]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:19:15.605 --> 01:19:20.327]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:19:20.487 --> 01:19:35.077]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:41.862]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today, and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[01:19:53.329 --> 01:19:58.472]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[01:19:58.732 --> 01:20:00.853]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[01:20:01.393 --> 01:20:05.996]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[01:20:06.296 --> 01:20:07.617]  It actually works.
[01:20:08.072 --> 01:20:11.514]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[01:20:11.554 --> 01:20:13.055]  I've tried many, many products.
[01:20:13.215 --> 01:20:15.457]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.

[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:20.540]  It truly works.

[01:20:41.892 --> 01:20:42.332]  Is America bankrupt?
[01:20:42.352 --> 01:20:44.493]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?

[01:21:53.369 --> 01:21:59.677]  Maka is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[01:22:00.038 --> 01:22:04.143]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[01:22:04.644 --> 01:22:11.853]  Only recently has science discovered that Maka is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[01:22:12.373 --> 01:22:19.715]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[01:22:20.075 --> 01:22:22.316]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence.
[01:22:22.636 --> 01:22:25.917]  Relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and TMS discomfort.
[01:22:26.297 --> 01:22:29.458]  Helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[01:22:29.758 --> 01:22:32.739]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[01:22:33.179 --> 01:22:38.260]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.241]  Because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.

[01:22:45.443 --> 01:22:48.445]  Okay, we're talking to Phil Jayhan of Alex Jones.
[01:22:48.465 --> 01:22:50.206]  You can see his evidence at
[01:23:11.784 --> 01:23:18.768]  9-1-1 let's roll dot O-R-G and he's been covering this for how many years since you put your website up Phil?
[01:23:19.709 --> 01:23:21.370]  My website's been up for about five months.
[01:23:23.191 --> 01:23:26.413]  I think you were, but I mean how long since you've been posting stuff on the internet?
[01:23:27.474 --> 01:23:28.715]  Probably about two and a half years.
[01:23:29.075 --> 01:23:29.655]  Yeah.
[01:23:29.675 --> 01:23:30.256]  A little bit more.
[01:23:31.161 --> 01:23:35.784]  You know, it started about three months after 9-1-1 and, you know, I just started putting it together in a thread.
[01:23:35.864 --> 01:23:39.086]  Well, this is something everybody can do is just point out inconsistencies.
[01:23:39.186 --> 01:23:46.730]  I mean, clearly you watch the Fox video and CBS video and it shows bombs going off in demolition style down the side of the building.
[01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:48.531]  It was reported by the firefighters.
[01:23:48.571 --> 01:23:49.652]  I've talked to them personally.
[01:23:50.032 --> 01:23:58.337]  And then Building 7 wasn't hit by an aircraft, but it, you know, geometrically explodes and, you know, falls in.
[01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:01.735]  And then the firefighters go, oh yeah, we were told to get back.
[01:24:01.755 --> 01:24:02.696]  They were about to pull it.
[01:24:02.936 --> 01:24:03.757]  We're about to blow it up.
[01:24:03.797 --> 01:24:06.078]  And then the owner comes on and says, oh yeah, we blew it up.
[01:24:06.499 --> 01:24:08.440]  And then it's still not a major news story.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:12.904]  And I've called Larry Silverstein's office 10 times at least, and he won't come on the show.
[01:24:12.924 --> 01:24:13.884]  He won't respond.
[01:24:14.605 --> 01:24:16.686]  That's a real shocker, huh?
[01:24:16.706 --> 01:24:17.347]  Yeah, it is.
[01:24:18.548 --> 01:24:19.188]  Yeah.
[01:24:20.069 --> 01:24:23.792]  The whole thing, I mean, all three buildings fell without any resistance.
[01:24:24.532 --> 01:24:27.815]  And, you know, as you're aware, but maybe a lot of people aren't,
[01:24:28.992 --> 01:24:35.736]  It's the first three steel structures, steel skyscrapers that have fallen because of fire alone.
[01:24:37.137 --> 01:24:38.098]  It's the first time in history.
[01:24:38.138 --> 01:24:38.859]  It's never happened.
[01:24:39.499 --> 01:24:41.541]  But then they say, oh, it was the jet fuel.
[01:24:41.881 --> 01:24:47.485]  The people were standing in the holes in the building, and the firefighters were reporting, send up more crews.
[01:24:47.505 --> 01:24:48.786]  The fires were almost out.
[01:24:49.286 --> 01:24:51.928]  And then suddenly, boom, boom, boom, boom, it's bombs, bombs!
[01:24:52.288 --> 01:24:54.510]  And the seismographs and everything and the witnesses.
[01:24:55.090 --> 01:25:00.393]  It all happens, and the Feds say, all the firefighter transmission tapes malfunctioned, man, the city messed up.
[01:25:00.754 --> 01:25:10.699]  Then it came out in New York Daily News that, no, no, the government declared national security and took all those tapes, just like the FAA tapes they accidentally shredded from five towers.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:17.864]  Yeah, you know, the whole cover-up is incredible, and what's incredible is that there's no outrage from the American public over this.
[01:25:19.765 --> 01:25:22.466]  Like, you know, the buildings fell without any
[01:25:23.792 --> 01:25:24.853]  Resistance whatsoever.
[01:25:25.533 --> 01:25:27.515]  It's clear that you can see the bombs going off.
[01:25:27.575 --> 01:25:30.197]  It's clear that they were, you know, controlled, you know, demolition.
[01:25:30.737 --> 01:25:38.382]  And how Larry Silverstein could ever collect on insurance, you know, for pulling his own building is beyond me.
[01:25:38.402 --> 01:25:40.764]  I mean... Well, that's the payout.
[01:25:41.564 --> 01:25:42.785]  But he only got $3 billion.
[01:25:42.805 --> 01:25:43.866]  They said he couldn't have double.
[01:25:43.906 --> 01:25:44.707]  He couldn't have seven.
[01:25:45.227 --> 01:25:47.208]  Yeah, I think that's because of all the 9-1-1 sites.
[01:25:47.649 --> 01:25:52.312]  I think that, you know, it had an effect on him being able to collect and do what he was doing.
[01:25:53.564 --> 01:26:05.650]  You know, I've read articles where we've had guests on who go to the public street in front of it, unfurl a sign saying Bush did it, or prior knowledge of 9-11, and the police come and threaten to arrest them or arrest them.
[01:26:06.130 --> 01:26:08.111]  You spent a few days down there.
[01:26:08.151 --> 01:26:08.891]  What happened to you?
[01:26:08.911 --> 01:26:10.512]  Uh, nothing.
[01:26:11.672 --> 01:26:21.537]  I was, you know, and I've seen the other people you were just talking about, and maybe this was happening in the past or it happened sporadically, but for the most part, I mean, you know,
[01:26:22.316 --> 01:26:23.236]  For the whole part, actually.
[01:26:23.456 --> 01:26:26.397]  You're left alone with whatever you want to, you know, demonstrate with down there.
[01:26:26.417 --> 01:26:29.138]  How many people were out there getting the word out?
[01:26:30.799 --> 01:26:36.320]  There was a whole bunch of people from the, I believe it's the ny911truth.org.
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.582]  You know, I think it's Plus Jamison is one of the, you know, founders of the site.
[01:26:42.002 --> 01:26:50.045]  But they're out there every Saturday, and they spend their time, their money, and you know, they sit and they talk to people.
[01:26:50.425 --> 01:26:51.285]  And the funny thing is,
[01:26:51.747 --> 01:26:59.929]  As I sat there and watched them and listened to them give their presentations to the people, all the people are open to this, Alex.
[01:26:59.989 --> 01:27:01.570]  Like, never before.
[01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:06.131]  Two years ago, you could have never gotten people to even listen to this.
[01:27:06.391 --> 01:27:09.012]  And again, that's when public opinion was the other direction.
[01:27:09.092 --> 01:27:11.313]  That's when the cops would arrest you because they'd get away with it.
[01:27:11.673 --> 01:27:16.954]  And now, as you just said, I've talked to others, they're not doing it now because the people know it's the truth.
[01:27:17.575 --> 01:27:18.995]  Yeah, I would have to agree with you.
[01:27:20.195 --> 01:27:21.596]  Phil, a side issue here.
[01:27:22.757 --> 01:27:27.160]  This is somewhat important for everybody out there.
[01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:28.401]  Oh, we'll go ahead with your point.
[01:27:28.441 --> 01:27:29.162]  I'll bring it up in a second.
[01:27:29.182 --> 01:27:29.502]  Go ahead.
[01:27:29.842 --> 01:27:30.803]  Oh, I lost my train of thought.
[01:27:30.823 --> 01:27:31.323]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:27:31.824 --> 01:27:32.304]  I did, too.
[01:27:32.324 --> 01:27:36.027]  That rarely happens, but I was busy interrupting you trying to bring up a good point.
[01:27:40.783 --> 01:27:42.344]  Oh, I was going to bring up the pilot.
[01:27:43.285 --> 01:27:50.190]  Now again, you're reporting, others have said, I called Colonel Donna Graham-Preece, he said, well, that's the name that I was told face-to-face.
[01:27:50.230 --> 01:28:08.825]  He claims that he talked face-to-face with this officer in the Air Force who says that he shot down Flight 93, but I haven't been able to... I've called his airbase, I've confirmed he's there, I've said, we want to know about this news report, will he please talk to us?
[01:28:09.345 --> 01:28:10.346]  That was yesterday.
[01:28:11.369 --> 01:28:12.770]  We've got his home address now.
[01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:14.030]  We're trying to get the number, but can't.
[01:28:14.770 --> 01:28:19.072]  But, I mean, you'd think that he'd want to talk to us and tell us it wasn't true or it is true.
[01:28:19.732 --> 01:28:21.853]  We're obviously going to give him some more time.
[01:28:22.473 --> 01:28:26.094]  But I hope it's not going to be like Larry Silverstein, where he just never responds to us.
[01:28:26.454 --> 01:28:28.075]  Well, he's still under ownership, isn't he?
[01:28:28.095 --> 01:28:31.196]  I mean, I don't think he would be free to discuss something like this, do you?
[01:28:31.496 --> 01:28:32.296]  I think you're right.
[01:28:32.356 --> 01:28:33.056]  I think you're right.
[01:28:33.116 --> 01:28:34.337]  But I just want to find out.
[01:28:34.357 --> 01:28:35.617]  I want to ask him about your report.
[01:28:36.117 --> 01:28:39.158]  Oh, I'd love to, you know, see how he would respond to this.
[01:28:39.278 --> 01:28:40.759]  And, you know, for everybody out there,
[01:28:41.152 --> 01:28:42.474]  You know, he was just following order.
[01:28:42.854 --> 01:28:43.475]  We've got a break.
[01:28:43.495 --> 01:28:43.835]  Stay there.
[01:28:44.136 --> 01:28:45.057]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.517 --> 01:28:47.139]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.724]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.187 --> 01:28:59.409]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:28:59.549 --> 01:29:07.632]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:29:07.892 --> 01:29:14.954]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:29:15.134 --> 01:29:16.415]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:29:16.495 --> 01:29:22.400]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:27.664]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:29:27.784 --> 01:29:36.672]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:29:36.932 --> 01:29:40.234]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:29:42.316 --> 01:29:42.656]  We're good.
[01:30:01.604 --> 01:30:04.585]  Not getting all the news that's fit to print due to mainstream press censors?

[01:30:55.935 --> 01:30:57.276]  Summer's just around the corner.
[01:30:57.496 --> 01:30:58.697]  What are your plans for it?
[01:30:59.017 --> 01:30:59.398]  Fishing?
[01:30:59.658 --> 01:31:00.118]  Gardening?
[01:31:00.178 --> 01:31:00.579]  Camping?
[01:31:00.779 --> 01:31:02.940]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:06.343]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[01:31:06.563 --> 01:31:08.924]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[01:31:09.205 --> 01:31:12.567]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[01:31:12.907 --> 01:31:14.749]  Deet is proven to keep the bugs away.
[01:31:14.969 --> 01:31:18.031]  But it's also proven to cause brain damage in the laboratory animals.
[01:31:18.371 --> 01:31:20.834]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to.
[01:31:21.035 --> 01:31:24.158]  Thanks to Natural Answer, available at NaturalAnswer.com.

[01:32:21.121 --> 01:32:22.722]  They think Bush is this great conservative.
[01:32:23.942 --> 01:32:29.125]  As the government spirals out of control and metastasizes at light speed,

[01:34:53.404 --> 01:34:55.044]  Folks, I grew up in Dallas.
[01:34:55.144 --> 01:34:58.925]  The water is so bad in Dallas, when I go back and drink a glass of tap water, it makes me sick.
[01:35:00.005 --> 01:35:03.626]  Austin's water is a little bit better, but after you've been drinking big murky water, it tastes horrible.
[01:35:04.614 --> 01:35:05.595]  Get a Big Berkey.
[01:35:06.095 --> 01:35:07.015]  Made in America.
[01:35:07.055 --> 01:35:07.936]  Great product.
[01:35:07.976 --> 01:35:09.356]  Supports this broadcast.
[01:35:10.157 --> 01:35:11.838]  Your body is 70% water.
[01:35:12.198 --> 01:35:13.438]  Stop drinking the poison.
[01:35:13.839 --> 01:35:15.539]  Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[01:35:15.619 --> 01:35:17.981]  Tell us about the Big Berkey and the specials and how we get it.
[01:35:18.761 --> 01:35:19.381]  Hi Alex.
[01:35:19.461 --> 01:35:20.622]  Thank you for having me.
[01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:30.727]  Well, the Berkey water filter systems come in different models, but they're all basically the same technology is that they are gravity fed water filter.
[01:35:31.474 --> 01:35:43.777]  It requires no electricity or water pressure to rid the water of the bad pathogens that have been added to our water system.
[01:35:44.397 --> 01:35:49.938]  You know, it's time for us to take control of our health as well as our physical surroundings.
[01:35:50.358 --> 01:35:59.180]  And one of the easiest ways to take control of our health is by drinking clean, bacteria-free, chemical-free water.
[01:35:59.827 --> 01:36:05.089]  We're slowly poisoning our systems on a daily basis without even realizing it.
[01:36:05.229 --> 01:36:14.093]  You know, you think that you're doing a good thing by putting the Coke down and going to the faucet and getting a drink of water, but really and truly, it's just as bad.
[01:36:14.113 --> 01:36:18.595]  And so with the Berkey Water Filter, you can have it in your kitchen.
[01:36:18.655 --> 01:36:25.077]  You just put your tap water right into it using a pitcher and let it process through.
[01:36:25.137 --> 01:36:26.598]  It's a very slow drip.
[01:36:27.116 --> 01:36:33.517]  It holds two and a half gallons of water and you continually fill it as you use it so most people don't ever run out of water.
[01:36:33.537 --> 01:36:38.358]  It really makes a difference in your life to be drinking good healthy water.
[01:36:39.439 --> 01:36:45.400]  We do have two different specials available as far as with the Berkey Light Water Filters.
[01:36:46.340 --> 01:36:54.322]  We have the $199 special which gives you the water filter system as well as a free gift.
[01:36:55.242 --> 01:37:11.058]  And then the 259 water filter system that gives you the Berkey light with an added feature which are some lights in the base so that if your power were to go out or if you were on the road... Powerful array of LEDs in blue or white lights, your choice.
[01:37:11.378 --> 01:37:13.180]  Burns for 14 years continuously.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:14.781]  Comes with rechargeable batteries.
[01:37:14.801 --> 01:37:16.043]  You can also order a supplemental
[01:37:16.943 --> 01:37:23.105]  A system that you can put out the window or on the back porch or inside the house.
[01:37:23.265 --> 01:37:25.826]  A solar panel that will recharge those batteries.
[01:37:25.846 --> 01:37:32.888]  You can also then use the system to run cell phones and shortwave radios, whatever.
[01:37:33.568 --> 01:37:40.790]  And folks, a comparable cheap Indian knockoff from India of these gravity filters will be $250-$300 at the camping and hunting supply shop.
[01:37:45.496 --> 01:38:00.372]  Okay, this is Made in America, top of the line, a new standard, this is the big soul maker right here in America, been in business for many years, been a sponsor for many years of this broadcast, and I would just challenge everybody out there
[01:38:01.201 --> 01:38:04.703]  To take action now and to give Debbie a call 1-888-803-4438.
[01:38:04.823 --> 01:38:08.126]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:38:08.246 --> 01:38:13.609]  It's not just for disasters.
[01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:14.590]  It's for a way of life.
[01:38:14.950 --> 01:38:16.271]  Get off the poison water.
[01:38:16.711 --> 01:38:17.792]  It's just that simple.
[01:38:18.192 --> 01:38:20.414]  I see stories every day about what's in the water supply.
[01:38:20.434 --> 01:38:20.974]  888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[01:38:25.504 --> 01:38:33.911]  And then tell them in the comments section that it's the Alex Jones Special and what free gift, what video, what DVD you want, or what sport bottle you want.
[01:38:34.851 --> 01:38:37.994]  Or go to InfoWars.com and the shopping cart you can order there as well.
[01:38:38.254 --> 01:38:39.195]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:38:39.215 --> 01:38:40.095]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:40.456 --> 01:38:40.916]  You're great.
[01:38:40.956 --> 01:38:41.536]  God bless you.
[01:38:41.596 --> 01:38:47.881]  And folks, if you call and the phone's busy or it goes to voicemail, if the operators are busy, leave your name and number and they'll call you right back.
[01:38:48.502 --> 01:38:50.143]  Again, that's 888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[01:38:53.257 --> 01:38:55.400]  OK, I want to thank Phil Jahan for holding.
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:38:56.843]  Let's cover some more of this information.
[01:38:56.883 --> 01:38:58.926]  We'll go to some calls, Phil, at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:38:59.006 --> 01:39:03.793]  Phil, again, something you mentioned in the last segment was so paramount.
[01:39:09.699 --> 01:39:12.801]  That two years ago, you'd go out and talk to people and got a different response.
[01:39:12.881 --> 01:39:13.521]  Same thing here.
[01:39:14.041 --> 01:39:18.604]  Two years later, I've done thousands of... I mean, it's over 1,600 radio interviews.
[01:39:19.044 --> 01:39:24.527]  Almost no one calls in the disagrees on other people's shows, even when the talk show host is attacking me.
[01:39:25.347 --> 01:39:29.229]  So this really shows that people know deep down something's wrong.
[01:39:29.249 --> 01:39:30.150]  Can you speak to that, Phil?
[01:39:31.047 --> 01:39:32.327]  Yeah, they sure do.
[01:39:32.387 --> 01:39:35.288]  I mean, I think it was Abraham Lincoln.
[01:39:35.989 --> 01:39:41.750]  I'm not sure who said it, but you can fool some of the people some of the time, most of the people most of the time, but you can't fool them all of the time.
[01:39:42.651 --> 01:39:44.991]  And that's so true.
[01:39:45.191 --> 01:39:50.053]  You know, people, you know, deep down, they know that something's not right, but they don't want to question it.
[01:39:51.273 --> 01:39:55.455]  They don't want to be viewed as unpatriotic or, you know, whatever their particular gig is.
[01:39:56.555 --> 01:39:59.556]  And I've found that, you know, people are so
[01:40:00.563 --> 01:40:06.249]  You know, they're so open to hear this now and and to see it and to receive it as the truth.
[01:40:07.210 --> 01:40:07.970]  It's unbelievable.
[01:40:08.471 --> 01:40:10.913]  I think it's, you know, partially due to time.
[01:40:11.434 --> 01:40:16.699]  And it's also due to, you know, the terrible, you know, presidency that we have.
[01:40:16.939 --> 01:40:22.545]  And just I mean, this man is a tyrant and people are starting to see him for what he is.
[01:40:23.846 --> 01:40:29.069]  Well, obviously Bush is just a puppet, and I think if Al Gore would have gotten in, we'd have seen the same stuff.
[01:40:29.129 --> 01:40:41.157]  It's just that we're so far into the New World Order now that the progression of things is just getting worse and worse, but I agree that those that can pull the strings of George W. Bush are tyrants, and
[01:40:41.983 --> 01:40:47.067]  This announcement yesterday that we can secretly arrest citizens with no trial, and you're never heard of again.
[01:40:47.488 --> 01:40:49.509]  Because we're above the law, we're the government.
[01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:52.372]  We're allowed to torture people, we're above the federal law.
[01:40:52.832 --> 01:40:55.454]  You know, we're allowed to get rid of the borders, we're above the federal law.
[01:40:56.095 --> 01:41:02.360]  I mean, they are announcing themselves that the government is God, and I'm sorry, the state is not God.
[01:41:03.341 --> 01:41:10.247]  No, and you know, the funny thing is, is, you know, Americans have been, you know, incrementally, you know, prepared for this.
[01:41:11.036 --> 01:41:17.820]  For a long time, Americans have watched their own government do this overseas to other countries, and they winked at it.
[01:41:17.860 --> 01:41:18.500]  They didn't care.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:21.482]  And we knew that that's what our government did.
[01:41:21.942 --> 01:41:23.443]  And we didn't rein them in.
[01:41:24.204 --> 01:41:38.952]  And, you know, common sense would tell the average person that if we allow our government to sponsor terrorism all over the world, like we have for the last 50 years, or longer, that sooner or later, they're going to bring it home to us.
[01:41:40.197 --> 01:41:41.437]  And that's exactly what they've done.
[01:41:43.338 --> 01:41:45.618]  I'm sorry, my voice... No, you're doing a great job.
[01:41:45.698 --> 01:41:47.519]  And that's how they scare us into submission.
[01:41:47.539 --> 01:41:48.619]  That's how they control us, Bill.
[01:41:49.139 --> 01:41:50.019]  Yeah, it sure is.
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:51.680]  It's all fear.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:55.861]  I mean, I experienced a lot of it when I took this website out.
[01:41:55.881 --> 01:41:58.542]  I mean, I think you have too.
[01:41:59.642 --> 01:42:00.522]  It's very real.
[01:42:01.942 --> 01:42:02.503]  It's subtle.
[01:42:03.223 --> 01:42:05.563]  And it's always gnawing at the back of your mind.
[01:42:05.963 --> 01:42:07.344]  What's going to happen if I talk?
[01:42:07.684 --> 01:42:08.284]  What's going to happen
[01:42:08.743 --> 01:42:16.147]  If I go knock on the door of this embassy and, you know, I get somebody to listen and accept that this is true, you live in fear.
[01:42:16.387 --> 01:42:19.848]  Well, the answer is for more of us to stand up, and I feel empowered myself.
[01:42:20.589 --> 01:42:21.249]  Yeah, me too.
[01:42:21.649 --> 01:42:38.117]  You know, and I get... I'm empowered just by knocking on doors of embassies and talking to diplomats and their aides and having them look through my 90 second presentation and being convinced, you know, just on that alone.
[01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:41.292]  I mean, we're ready.
[01:42:41.513 --> 01:42:50.402]  All we need, Alex, is more foot soldiers out there to do whatever they can to share what happened on 9-1-1.
[01:42:50.422 --> 01:42:58.110]  And we can break this open and we can actually, you know, hang the perpetrators that did this and take back our government.
[01:42:58.130 --> 01:42:59.251]  There's a possibility of that.
[01:43:02.225 --> 01:43:06.808]  Well, I totally agree with you, and look, we have to debate 9-11.
[01:43:06.868 --> 01:43:09.390]  We have to look at all the facets of it, Phil.
[01:43:09.590 --> 01:43:13.353]  All I've ever said is that I think that anybody that talks about 9-11
[01:43:14.756 --> 01:43:42.114]  On any website should also explore all the avenues, should cover all the issues, the things that cannot be debated, that supposed hijackers were trained at US military bases, that their houses and cars and credit cards were paid for by the government, that there was CIA insider trading, that public officials were warned not to fly, that Bin Laden is CIA, that Al Qaeda was flown out in safety in the middle of the Afghan war, that all of this is going on.
[01:43:43.194 --> 01:43:44.035]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:43:44.645 --> 01:43:47.926]  And to tell you the truth, you know, I mean, my site lacks a lot of these things.
[01:43:48.006 --> 01:43:52.568]  Not because I don't believe them or not because I don't think they'd be profitable, but I lack the time.
[01:43:52.808 --> 01:43:56.530]  You know, most of the time, like, I've taken a month off of work.
[01:43:57.070 --> 01:44:01.752]  Actually, I'm going on two months now, but... Oh, I'm not even particularly talking about your site.
[01:44:01.772 --> 01:44:10.375]  I mean, all of us need to... I mean, I do it discredit when I just get on here and say the government did 9-11, or elements of it did, without going into the evidence.
[01:44:11.222 --> 01:44:23.087]  And look, I've sat here before and done three hours without a phone call, at rocket speed, just covering mainstream news article after mainstream news article, you know, six hundred plus of them.
[01:44:23.147 --> 01:44:26.348]  That's how much evidence there is, and there's new evidence all the time.
[01:44:27.168 --> 01:44:27.648]  And you know what?
[01:44:27.688 --> 01:44:29.029]  There's absolutely no evidence.
[01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:31.950]  There's no proof of the government's story.
[01:44:32.430 --> 01:44:33.731]  They haven't provided anything.
[01:44:33.951 --> 01:44:37.312]  I mean, I was listening to Dave and Kleist a little bit earlier,
[01:44:37.885 --> 01:44:39.546]  And, you know, I like the way he says it.
[01:44:39.566 --> 01:44:42.087]  I mean, the government's story is a conspiracy theory.
[01:44:42.807 --> 01:44:46.528]  You know, it's a theory that's not backed by evidence, proof, or facts.
[01:44:47.068 --> 01:44:48.569]  And they've done no investigation.
[01:44:49.109 --> 01:44:56.752]  And they've taken all the resources of the investigators and used these to cover it up instead of bring it out.
[01:44:58.073 --> 01:44:58.753]  And it's maddening.
[01:44:59.153 --> 01:44:59.553]  I hear you.
[01:44:59.573 --> 01:45:00.854]  Let's take a few calls here.
[01:45:01.814 --> 01:45:03.735]  Let's talk to Paul in Delaware.
[01:45:03.755 --> 01:45:04.595]  Thanks for holding, Paul.
[01:45:06.128 --> 01:45:08.310]  Phil, I really appreciate what you're doing, my man.
[01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:12.954]  It's the first time I've heard you and, man, I really appreciate everything you're doing out there.
[01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:18.098]  I've got two comments and then I have a question for Phil and then I'm going to hang up.
[01:45:19.719 --> 01:45:23.583]  We were talking about the draft earlier and it's good, great.
[01:45:24.123 --> 01:45:26.185]  We need to inform people on what they're trying to do.
[01:45:27.086 --> 01:45:30.889]  But as far as being concerned about, oh my God, they're going to draft me?
[01:45:31.368 --> 01:45:32.049]  Hey, wake up.
[01:45:32.209 --> 01:45:36.011]  All you have to do is not do what they say.
[01:45:37.092 --> 01:45:37.792]  Bottom line.
[01:45:38.213 --> 01:45:43.556]  Well, what they'll do is they'll arrest a few prominent people to scare all of us into going and signing up.
[01:45:43.776 --> 01:45:45.297]  But they're not going to be able to make us do it.
[01:45:45.517 --> 01:45:56.645]  What they're going to do is they're going to blow a bunch of stuff up and then use that patriotic fervor, that helpful wave of indignation that Northwood's document talks about, to get us to run and go along with it.
[01:45:57.385 --> 01:45:58.806]  Yeah.
[01:46:00.196 --> 01:46:19.912]  The point was, Phil, I was, when 9-11 first happened, the day that it happened, and they kept on repeating the same footage, I'm in Delaware, and in Philadelphia, they came forward and said that they found some SimTechs in one of, either a train locker or a bus station.
[01:46:20.432 --> 01:46:21.973]  And it was a whole bunch of this stuff.
[01:46:21.993 --> 01:46:23.535]  It was a bus station, I remember that.
[01:46:23.555 --> 01:46:27.838]  I remember hearing it on television, on the radio, and then nothing ever came of it.
[01:46:27.998 --> 01:46:28.739]  Phil, any comments?
[01:46:29.542 --> 01:46:31.503]  You know, Alex, I'm completely ignorant of that story.
[01:46:31.523 --> 01:46:32.363]  I've never even heard of it.
[01:46:33.764 --> 01:46:34.705]  Yeah, there's just so many.
[01:46:34.965 --> 01:46:35.945]  Anything else, Paul?
[01:46:36.205 --> 01:46:46.170]  Yeah, well, if you call up any news station in Philadelphia, the only thing they would tell me about it first, the first one I called said, when I did a follow-up, they said, oh, it never happened.
[01:46:46.190 --> 01:46:46.851]  It was a mistake.
[01:46:47.291 --> 01:46:48.371]  Then I said, well, hold on a minute.
[01:46:48.431 --> 01:46:49.292]  How could it be a mistake?
[01:46:49.332 --> 01:46:55.095]  How could they make such a big statement at the time of 9-11 and then just say, oh, it was a mistake?
[01:46:55.135 --> 01:46:57.536]  So I called back again at another
[01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.510]  I think so.
[01:47:11.903 --> 01:47:15.366]  They were talking about gold being in the 9-11 building.
[01:47:15.426 --> 01:47:16.227]  No, that's admitted.
[01:47:16.267 --> 01:47:20.371]  There was a giant reserve of it there, and no one ever asked where that gold is.
[01:47:20.411 --> 01:47:20.991]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:21.291 --> 01:47:24.634]  There was about $200 billion from what I've gathered.
[01:47:24.754 --> 01:47:25.635]  $168 billion.
[01:47:27.077 --> 01:47:29.198]  That's what the Associated Press said beforehand.
[01:47:29.238 --> 01:47:31.480]  There was an admitted gold depository there.
[01:47:34.384 --> 01:47:41.609]  Again, nobody's... Again, this is... It's like the CIA running a drill of flying hijacked jets in the Pentagon World Trade Center on 9-11.
[01:47:41.849 --> 01:47:44.010]  That's admitted, but then no one discusses it.
[01:47:44.351 --> 01:47:49.894]  Well, there was two gold... giant gold trucks, armored trucks, that were found in the rubble.
[01:47:50.375 --> 01:47:53.477]  And they were found in a tunnel on their way out of the World Trade Center.
[01:47:54.217 --> 01:47:59.521]  And the interesting thing about, you know, when they were found, is the drivers weren't in the trucks.
[01:47:59.881 --> 01:48:01.062]  There was no drivers killed.
[01:48:01.162 --> 01:48:01.322]  I mean,
[01:48:01.775 --> 01:48:04.796]  The trucks were abandoned, which means that they got advanced storage.
[01:48:04.816 --> 01:48:06.837]  But again, it's in the news that, ooh, where's all the gold?
[01:48:06.877 --> 01:48:09.579]  And suddenly that storage just disappears.
[01:48:09.859 --> 01:48:13.501]  Not to mention the hundreds of billions in credit card transactions that were erased.
[01:48:13.861 --> 01:48:17.142]  Okay, Don in North Carolina.
[01:48:17.182 --> 01:48:17.883]  Don, go ahead.
[01:48:18.863 --> 01:48:20.364]  Alex, good afternoon.
[01:48:20.424 --> 01:48:21.424]  Bill, hello as well.
[01:48:21.684 --> 01:48:22.445]  Hello.
[01:48:23.205 --> 01:48:27.027]  Before I ask you your question, I just want to say to all the listeners of your program,
[01:48:27.808 --> 01:48:38.254]  If you don't go and sign up to PrisonPlanetTV.org and support this man and what he is doing, you are not helping our cause.
[01:48:40.096 --> 01:48:40.696]  Absolutely.
[01:48:41.216 --> 01:48:47.980]  Alex, I bought a year's subscription from you and I think it is the most empowering information that a person can have.
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:48.901]  Well, thank you.
[01:48:48.941 --> 01:48:51.522]  There's a lot on the site now at PrisonPlanetTV.org.
[01:48:51.542 --> 01:48:52.983]  Thank you, sir.
[01:48:53.223 --> 01:48:53.924]  So you like it?
[01:48:54.412 --> 01:48:55.193]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:55.713 --> 01:48:59.176]  I've been spending a lot of time going through the information late at night.
[01:49:00.177 --> 01:49:00.477]  Phil?
[01:49:01.437 --> 01:49:02.238]  Yeah?
[01:49:03.879 --> 01:49:21.333]  When I look at your website and I see this version, the black and white version, where it's appearing to launch a missile, but at the same time that flash can also be construed to also
[01:49:22.003 --> 01:49:26.425]  Mimic what Jack Blood has alluded to, that this is a GP bomb.
[01:49:27.246 --> 01:49:28.206]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:28.566 --> 01:49:34.169]  You know, I'm not married to saying what kind of missile it is or what kind of ordnance it is.
[01:49:34.610 --> 01:49:37.151]  I am saying that this is, you know, ordnance.
[01:49:37.431 --> 01:49:39.372]  And it's something that shoots out.
[01:49:39.572 --> 01:49:43.955]  But again, instead of focusing on the missile, what is this giant thing on the bottom of the plane?
[01:49:44.095 --> 01:49:45.175]  That can't be debated.
[01:49:45.295 --> 01:49:46.396]  There's no question.
[01:49:46.416 --> 01:49:46.896]  Stay there, Don.
[01:49:46.916 --> 01:49:47.416]  We'll come back.
[01:49:47.897 --> 01:49:48.477]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:49:48.497 --> 01:49:49.598]  We'll be right back with Bill J. Hinn.
[01:49:49.638 --> 01:49:50.318]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:53.982 --> 01:50:00.806]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.126 --> 01:50:02.486]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.687 --> 01:50:04.908]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.068 --> 01:50:07.149]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.409 --> 01:50:12.352]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.

[01:50:18.835 --> 01:50:29.481]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.621 --> 01:50:31.522]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:53:13.626 --> 01:53:15.446]  When the dam breaks, it's already breaking.
[01:53:15.987 --> 01:53:18.067]  The troop is pouring out, you can't stop it.
[01:53:19.948 --> 01:53:21.449]  Your house of cards is coming down.
[01:53:23.370 --> 01:53:24.370]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:25.931 --> 01:53:30.232]  We'll have to have Phil Jahan back up soon, but let's finish in this final segment.
[01:53:30.252 --> 01:53:31.393]  We've got another guest coming up.
[01:53:32.293 --> 01:53:35.675]  Don in North Carolina, finish up what you were saying, then we're going to go to John in Tennessee.
[01:53:37.295 --> 01:53:37.716]  Yes, Alex.
[01:53:38.116 --> 01:53:38.436]  Thank you.
[01:53:40.094 --> 01:53:48.146]  I'm just saying there's a little bit of gray area there of whether or not this is actually a missile.
[01:53:48.166 --> 01:53:55.918]  I think there's some plausibility that some of what we're seeing might be a reflection that would indicate that there's a missile trail, but I don't
[01:53:59.009 --> 01:54:06.274]  Well, you know, there was all these indicators that there were bombs, now it's 100% confirmed in the building and in WTC7 in the building.
[01:54:06.354 --> 01:54:14.798]  So, I think it needs to be looked at and examined and it's important, but I think it's all part of a larger package of irrefutable things that need to be focused on.
[01:54:14.998 --> 01:54:24.664]  And I see the mainstream media in some cases focuses on the Pentagon, focuses on things like this because they can kind of muddy the waters and not bring out the specifics.
[01:54:24.924 --> 01:54:28.645]  Right, but no matter what, no matter what it is, there's no question there's a pod there.
[01:54:28.785 --> 01:54:29.725]  It shouldn't be there.
[01:54:30.225 --> 01:54:32.065]  That means it's an inside operation.
[01:54:32.105 --> 01:54:33.146]  Alright, Don.
[01:54:33.186 --> 01:54:34.566]  Great points and thanks for your support.
[01:54:35.146 --> 01:54:35.846]  Do you agree with that?
[01:54:35.866 --> 01:54:37.627]  I mean, obviously there is a pod there, Phil.
[01:54:37.847 --> 01:54:38.547]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:38.607 --> 01:54:39.347]  It's indisputable.
[01:54:41.007 --> 01:54:54.490]  You know, I would just like to add that if you look at all the evidences in Mosaic, there's not one single video, and I think you've seen this yourself, Alex, there's not one single video that shows all the different, you know, evidences and proofs that we see all in one video.
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:55:03.747]  If you look at them like a mosaic, you'll be able to see, you know, a piece of evidence here and a piece of evidence here, and as you put it together, you can put a picture together.
[01:55:04.107 --> 01:55:24.124]  If you take the greenish video, which was shot by Camera Planet, this shows you the flash, and this shows you an actual picture of what I think is the missile, the rocket, the incendiary device, whatever it is, and it also shows that this penetrates the building, you know, about six feet to the right of the cockpit.
[01:55:24.921 --> 01:55:31.426]  And, you know, I'm persuaded, I'm absolutely sure that there's a double penetration happening here.
[01:55:31.506 --> 01:55:35.408]  That the cockpit is penetrating the... Well, certainly that aircraft is not standard.
[01:55:35.769 --> 01:55:37.190]  Let's talk to John in Tennessee.
[01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:38.010]  John, go ahead.
[01:55:38.591 --> 01:55:48.357]  If you go to Boeing's website at Boeing.com and click on the 757 section, you'll see that all 757s have large pods under the fuselage.
[01:55:48.878 --> 01:55:53.461]  These pods hold the landing gear after retraction, and no other airliners have these pods.
[01:55:54.056 --> 01:55:55.957]  Where the wings attach to the fuselage.
[01:55:56.237 --> 01:55:59.319]  John, we're talking about a different pod.
[01:55:59.359 --> 01:56:00.059]  I've looked at that.
[01:56:00.779 --> 01:56:01.760]  It's a different structure.
[01:56:01.980 --> 01:56:14.886]  Okay, well what I find most interesting on your website is that 757 refueling tankers may have been substituted, and this is exactly like Pentagon Operation Northwood's repaint robot drone.
[01:56:15.046 --> 01:56:15.667]  That's what they said.
[01:56:15.687 --> 01:56:19.428]  We're going to have stage flights take off with actors getting on board, U.S.
[01:56:19.769 --> 01:56:20.269]  military,
[01:56:20.999 --> 01:56:25.783]  And then that's going to land, and the drone flies in to do its attack.
[01:56:26.023 --> 01:56:39.675]  No, John, if you look at the picture that's on, you know, one of the first pictures on the top of the Let'sRoll911.org, you'll notice that in the back, right where the fuselage starts to go up and turn into a point, there's a dark blemish.
[01:56:40.736 --> 01:56:48.263]  And this is, you know, I personally believe that this is where they could have, you know, removed a fueling boom, and they didn't cover it up.
[01:56:48.908 --> 01:56:54.954]  This is exactly where the refueling boom would have come out, and you can see a mark where it should be.
[01:56:55.254 --> 01:57:05.925]  Well, in the Air Force, I worked on weapon systems and nuclear bombs, and I know what those pods look like, so yeah, you know, it's not a clear shot zoomed in where you could really see it.
[01:57:07.366 --> 01:57:09.849]  Is it not the same shape as a cruise missile pod?
[01:57:10.751 --> 01:57:11.211]  Well, yeah.
[01:57:11.231 --> 01:57:13.052]  I mean, you could put anything in those things.
[01:57:13.112 --> 01:57:20.376]  And with one and a half trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon, it'd be easy to hide three 757 tankers from the budget.
[01:57:20.536 --> 01:57:21.717]  It's 1.2 trillion missing.
[01:57:21.857 --> 01:57:23.437]  Oh, excuse me.
[01:57:23.597 --> 01:57:23.918]  All right.
[01:57:24.338 --> 01:57:24.878]  Thanks, John.
[01:57:25.578 --> 01:57:25.859]  All right.
[01:57:25.959 --> 01:57:26.779]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:26.799 --> 01:57:27.519]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:57:27.900 --> 01:57:29.460]  Phil Jayham, thanks for coming on, my friend.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.241]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:57:30.261 --> 01:57:30.901]  Thanks for having me.
[01:57:30.941 --> 01:57:31.521]  It's been a pleasure.
[01:57:31.641 --> 01:57:31.862]  You bet.
[01:57:31.882 --> 01:57:32.542]  We'll have you back up.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.101]  Alright, my friends.
[01:57:34.381 --> 01:57:34.722]  You heard it.
[01:57:35.222 --> 01:57:36.764]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:57:36.784 --> 01:57:38.565]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:57:38.605 --> 01:57:39.867]  So be sure and stay with us.
[01:57:39.927 --> 01:57:40.727]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:40.767 --> 01:57:41.508]  God bless you all.
[01:57:42.129 --> 01:57:44.531]  Big Brother.
[01:57:52.103 --> 01:57:53.144]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.884 --> 01:57:54.984]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.625 --> 01:57:56.485]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.205 --> 01:57:58.106]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.606 --> 01:58:02.447]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.967 --> 01:58:07.089]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.331 --> 01:58:14.072]  All I'm doing is defending my family.
[01:58:14.092 --> 01:58:16.213]  I know the globalists are criminally insane.
[01:58:17.654 --> 01:58:18.997]  Totally psychopathic.
[01:58:19.097 --> 01:58:19.919]  They love evil.
[01:58:19.979 --> 01:58:21.282]  That's the only way you can do this.
[01:58:21.342 --> 01:58:22.083]  They enjoy it.
[01:58:22.304 --> 01:58:23.567]  They don't just not care.
[01:58:23.587 --> 01:58:25.130]  They enjoy it.
[01:58:25.945 --> 01:58:28.147]  And Kathy's been a real trooper in Colorado holding forever.
[01:58:28.187 --> 01:58:29.047]  We're about to get to her.
[01:58:29.348 --> 01:58:32.390]  Then we'll get more into this new mass drugging program.
[01:58:32.750 --> 01:58:35.572]  The new freedom where they're going to try to force drugs on all of you.
[01:58:35.612 --> 01:58:37.273]  And they've set the precedent to force it.
[01:58:37.774 --> 01:58:39.575]  And the federal courts have been setting that precedent.
[01:58:39.595 --> 01:58:41.236]  And this is what the Soviets and the Nazis did.
[01:58:41.256 --> 01:58:41.777]  This isn't new.
[01:58:41.797 --> 01:58:44.779]  We'll talk about that with Dr. John Breeding, an incredible author.
[01:58:44.799 --> 01:58:47.441]  Tell you how to get his books early in this hour as well.
[01:58:48.342 --> 01:58:50.343]  Before we go to Kathy, I want to talk about some psychology.
[01:58:50.623 --> 01:58:52.785]  Because I've talked to you a lot, Doctor, on and off air.
[01:58:52.805 --> 01:58:54.006]  I respect your opinion on this.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:59.372]  When Bush and them come out and say, okay, here's the memos, we're above federal law even.
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:00.660]  Well,
[01:59:29.571 --> 01:59:46.984]  The structure of it, again, is that you're supporting the basic values of the civilization, which is exploitation and conquest abroad, and repression and pacification at home, and your minimum liability corporation, and the basic maximization of profit.
[01:59:47.004 --> 01:59:48.865]  That's what drives it structurally.
[01:59:49.226 --> 01:59:56.271]  But psychologically, I think you're describing basically this process that's called denial and projection.
[01:59:56.711 --> 01:59:58.793]  The assumption is that these guys
[01:59:59.921 --> 02:00:28.244]  on some level have been traumatized and they're in big denial about that and they project all that as evil out there and they cannot look at themselves and so they project that and Saddam Hussein is evil and Gaddafi is evil and Arafat is evil and whoever is evil and Russia is evil and Korea is evil and whoever is evil you know but we are all good and whatever we do is good and
[02:00:29.575 --> 02:00:32.457]  It's a massive split or whatever.
[02:00:32.778 --> 02:00:35.920]  It's a fracture in the psyche.
[02:00:36.821 --> 02:00:51.492]  Some people somehow are able to pull it off to where they can function real well and put on a good face and be a social guy at the party with the right people, but be completely disconnected with the truth of what their actions do
[02:00:52.228 --> 02:00:54.229]  And, uh, they just can't look at it.
[02:00:54.429 --> 02:00:56.809]  And I think if they did, they would blow up.
[02:00:57.069 --> 02:00:58.690]  You know, kind of like the Wicked Witch of the West.
[02:00:58.730 --> 02:00:59.910]  They'd just melt, you know?
[02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:08.792]  And, because, you know, there'd be so much shame and disgrace that would be felt, you know, that the person would just literally collapse.
[02:01:08.872 --> 02:01:10.773]  And that happens occasionally.
[02:01:10.793 --> 02:01:14.914]  Well, I've had these people walk up to me and tell me I should be arrested for the things I say.
[02:01:15.572 --> 02:01:26.876]  I mean, now I'm starting to hear that drumbeat out there, Dr. Breeding, so there's this balkanization, those that are going deeper in denial and violently hating those of us that tell the truth, and then this giant mass waking up.
[02:01:27.956 --> 02:01:29.477]  That's right, that's right, that's right.
[02:01:29.617 --> 02:01:41.421]  And you're pointing out example after example where people are being, where their rights are being taken away from them, they're being mistreated, they're being tortured, they're being terrorized, and all in the name of
[02:01:41.886 --> 02:01:42.426]  I don't know.
[02:02:04.775 --> 02:02:06.516]  You know, you've got an elephant in your living room.
[02:02:06.796 --> 02:02:08.616]  You know, you haven't cleaned your shoes.
[02:02:08.656 --> 02:02:11.737]  You know, you're an emperor and you're not really wearing any clothes.
[02:02:12.077 --> 02:02:13.337]  But in this case, it's even worse.
[02:02:13.377 --> 02:02:20.579]  You know, you're calling this person a terrorist and you're inflicting massive atrocity and terror on people.
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:26.861]  You know, you're saying you really support children and freedom, but you're going in there and forcing parents to drug their children.
[02:02:26.881 --> 02:02:33.023]  You're going in and forcing people to take these drugs, which have not been proven to help anybody anyway.
[02:02:33.633 --> 02:02:39.920]  And they even have to take the ones that you say they're going to take because they're the ones that your buddies make the money from.
[02:02:40.301 --> 02:02:41.222]  Doctor Incredible!
[02:02:41.522 --> 02:02:42.924]  Stay there, we'll come back to take calls.
[02:02:42.944 --> 02:02:43.805]  This is riveting!
[02:02:48.593 --> 02:02:54.077]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.497 --> 02:02:58.740]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:06.005]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:06.386 --> 02:03:12.490]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.630 --> 02:03:13.851]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:14.191 --> 02:03:17.133]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:17.293 --> 02:03:19.315]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:19.615 --> 02:03:26.859]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:30.542]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:03:57.744 --> 02:04:02.986]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:04:03.286 --> 02:04:07.408]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:04:07.608 --> 02:04:11.392]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:04:11.653 --> 02:04:16.298]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:04:16.378 --> 02:04:19.141]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:04:19.441 --> 02:04:22.645]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:04:22.685 --> 02:04:24.507]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:04:47.122 --> 02:04:48.164]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:04:48.484 --> 02:04:51.268]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:04:51.548 --> 02:04:55.694]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:04:56.134 --> 02:04:56.935]  So what do you do?
[02:04:56.955 --> 02:05:01.842]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:05:02.321 --> 02:05:04.442]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:05:36.495 --> 02:05:37.856]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:37.876 --> 02:05:38.856]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.680 --> 02:05:56.400]  All right, folks.
[02:05:56.641 --> 02:05:59.082]  Again, we've got about 51 minutes left with our guest.
[02:05:59.402 --> 02:06:00.643]  Haven't even hit the tip of the iceberg.
[02:06:00.683 --> 02:06:05.926]  We're about to go to Kathy and Logan and Fred and John and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:06:05.946 --> 02:06:15.851]  You know, good propaganda just plays to our own laziness, to getting us to rationalize what's going on and making us feel like we're part of the system.
[02:06:16.892 --> 02:06:23.796]  And, I mean, if you're not threatened by what the globalists are doing, if you can't see it, I mean, I am just amazed
[02:06:24.545 --> 02:06:35.310]  It's like it just comes out that Dick Cheney really does run all the bidding processes out of the Vice President's office, and then no one gets in trouble.
[02:06:35.370 --> 02:06:40.192]  There's over a trillion dollars missing from the Pentagon, and it gets to be on a couple news wires.
[02:06:40.673 --> 02:06:47.796]  I mean, the level of corruption going on right now has never before been seen.
[02:06:47.876 --> 02:06:49.597]  I mean, it is pell-mell.
[02:06:49.777 --> 02:06:52.878]  It is just bonkers wild.
[02:06:54.882 --> 02:07:04.607]  And I hope all of you realize that power corrupts absolutely, power corrupts absolutely, and this is what happens with a low-level psychopath, you know, in upstate New York, or with a Hitler.
[02:07:05.467 --> 02:07:14.012]  The more power they get, no one checks them, they get away with stuff, and then they just go nuts, and subconsciously they start self-destructing, you know, wanting to get caught.
[02:07:14.152 --> 02:07:20.275]  And that's my last psychological question, and we'll go to Kathy, but can you speak to that briefly, Doctor?
[02:07:21.261 --> 02:07:22.381]  Oh definitely, yeah.
[02:07:22.802 --> 02:07:32.985]  And first I want to say that Dick Cheney and Halliburton, the example in this show is called the director of Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation.
[02:07:33.005 --> 02:07:34.366]  His name is Steve Shawn.
[02:07:35.286 --> 02:07:45.050]  He's the doctor who's largely behind this Texas Medical Algorithm Project and he's the guy who was very involved in importing it to Pennsylvania.
[02:07:45.715 --> 02:07:46.296]  I think so.
[02:07:59.611 --> 02:08:01.992]  You know, this guy is ahead of T.D.A.
[02:08:02.052 --> 02:08:02.632]  and M.H.M.R.
[02:08:02.712 --> 02:08:04.812]  He's totally behind this dynamic.
[02:08:05.292 --> 02:08:11.814]  And, just like, when you asked your question about why is Dick Cheney getting away with this, it was like, why is Steve Shawn?
[02:08:11.854 --> 02:08:12.994]  Nobody's touched him yet.
[02:08:13.314 --> 02:08:13.574]  You know?
[02:08:13.874 --> 02:08:16.695]  And so, it is the exact parallel to what you're describing.
[02:08:16.715 --> 02:08:23.696]  I mean, now, they get caught doing evil things, and they go, nobody gets in trouble, because they all got their hands in the cookie jar.
[02:08:24.137 --> 02:08:25.557]  Nobody's gotten in trouble yet.
[02:08:27.273 --> 02:08:38.720]  Some people are starting to get in a little trouble, but this self-destruction process appears to be fairly and strongly in place, at least at the level of our national government.
[02:08:38.740 --> 02:08:41.642]  We'll see how it ends up going down.
[02:08:43.523 --> 02:08:54.450]  But yeah, I do see that as a dynamic, and the way I see it is that these actions are a gross violation of our inherent nature, in the sense that we're really spiritual beings
[02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:02.542]  You know, with an inborn or innate kind of ethics compass, you know, that's based on the fact that we're totally connected to each other.
[02:09:04.102 --> 02:09:07.503]  What's in our best interest is in the best interest of the people around us.
[02:09:07.543 --> 02:09:09.303]  Do unto others as you have them do unto you.
[02:09:09.323 --> 02:09:11.464]  And that law is not just an imposed law.
[02:09:11.524 --> 02:09:14.444]  It's really a natural law when you're connected with who you really are.
[02:09:14.764 --> 02:09:22.186]  When you're disconnected and you start to violate it, then you're acting out of ethics and you're systematically acting in conflict.
[02:09:22.603 --> 02:09:24.044]  With the truth of who you are.
[02:09:24.064 --> 02:09:32.067]  And so, I believe that there is a built-in thing that says, you know, that's oriented towards self-destruction.
[02:09:32.107 --> 02:09:38.130]  You know, that you will, in some way, it's like the criminal who leaves the unnecessary evidence at the scene of the crime.
[02:09:38.510 --> 02:09:47.935]  It's like George Bush, who leaves this obvious trail of evidence, you know, that just shows him lying over and over and over again, you know.
[02:09:48.275 --> 02:09:50.096]  It's like this guy, Steve Sean, you know,
[02:09:50.592 --> 02:09:51.533]  Absolutely, Dr. Lewis!
[02:10:05.959 --> 02:10:10.400]  Caught up in this illusion and these lies, and you're just constantly saying, Wake up people!
[02:10:10.440 --> 02:10:11.380]  Wake up people!
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:12.820]  If you don't see this, you're dead!
[02:10:13.080 --> 02:10:13.521]  Wake up!
[02:10:13.561 --> 02:10:13.881]  Wake up!
[02:10:13.901 --> 02:10:14.821]  You know, that's Alex Jones.
[02:10:15.821 --> 02:10:22.942]  And that's what we gotta do, you know, is say, our job, since we're all spiritual beings, is to say, hey brother, you are out of line!
[02:10:22.982 --> 02:10:27.023]  You're gonna lose, you've lost your soul forever!
[02:10:27.043 --> 02:10:28.624]  We're gonna stop you from this!
[02:10:28.684 --> 02:10:30.684]  Well, here's my last example, and we'll go to Kathy.
[02:10:32.204 --> 02:10:35.425]  Two years ago, Texas company, Protegein, Associated Press,
[02:10:36.768 --> 02:10:37.668]  96 locations.
[02:10:38.008 --> 02:10:41.289]  Pharmacological corn that grows live AIDS virus in it.
[02:10:42.650 --> 02:10:44.990]  And it was never even in the paper.
[02:10:45.010 --> 02:10:46.951]  It was just on the news wire in a few farming journals.
[02:10:47.451 --> 02:10:51.092]  And it was this big crisis where they burned fields and went into grain bins and tried to stop it.
[02:10:51.152 --> 02:10:53.893]  And then it just, you never hear about it again.
[02:10:53.933 --> 02:10:54.593]  I mean, they're going to build 30
[02:10:56.039 --> 02:10:58.140]  Six level four bioweapons labs.
[02:10:58.500 --> 02:11:01.081]  One of them has already been set up at the University of Texas at Galveston.
[02:11:01.721 --> 02:11:04.723]  It's just stuff that one accident can kill millions.
[02:11:04.763 --> 02:11:05.583]  They don't even care!
[02:11:05.603 --> 02:11:06.283]  They just do it!
[02:11:06.503 --> 02:11:08.244]  Let's talk to Kathy in Colorado.
[02:11:08.264 --> 02:11:09.124]  Kathy, thanks for holding.
[02:11:09.425 --> 02:11:10.165]  Go ahead, Kathy.
[02:11:10.505 --> 02:11:11.465]  Yes, thank you, Alex.
[02:11:12.206 --> 02:11:14.267]  You have been talking about medicating people.
[02:11:14.347 --> 02:11:18.248]  I just wanted to bring to mind what happened in our family.
[02:11:18.748 --> 02:11:21.029]  My father had to be put into an assisted living.
[02:11:21.049 --> 02:11:21.469]  He's 88 years old.
[02:11:23.214 --> 02:11:28.319]  And he had some problems, and later on they said it would be better if we put him into hospice.
[02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:36.207]  Now he didn't have cancer, but they said if he didn't want to take medication or his drugs, he didn't have to.
[02:11:37.188 --> 02:11:38.950]  And I thought, well that's great.
[02:11:39.250 --> 02:11:42.774]  I had power of attorney over him and all this stuff, and everything was legal.
[02:11:42.814 --> 02:11:47.138]  But anyway, I called back one week later to talk to hospice to see how he was doing.
[02:11:48.238 --> 02:11:51.940]  And when the lady said he was on Seroquel, I believe I'm pronouncing that right.
[02:11:51.980 --> 02:11:52.781]  Seroquel, yeah.
[02:11:53.021 --> 02:11:54.322]  I said, well, what is that?
[02:11:55.302 --> 02:11:56.883]  And she said, well, I don't know.
[02:11:56.903 --> 02:12:00.805]  I said, well, they put him on stuff and they didn't even tell me about it.
[02:12:01.326 --> 02:12:08.129]  So I called a pharmacist and they said it was an antidepressant and that it was for bipolar.
[02:12:08.730 --> 02:12:10.571]  I said, my dad's never been bipolar.
[02:12:11.323 --> 02:12:19.069]  I was just horrified, because I know the effects... Well, when you've got troops that have got a leg blown off a complaint because of bad treatment, they go, you're going on drugs.
[02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:22.972]  When you have a child that, you know, is drinking too many Cokes and is hyper, you're going on Ritalin.
[02:12:23.352 --> 02:12:27.115]  And a lot of old people, without even a doctor, they just say, here, you're going on it.
[02:12:27.555 --> 02:12:28.816]  Dr. Breeding, can you speak to that?
[02:12:29.576 --> 02:12:36.982]  In Texas, three years ago, we went to the legislature and got them to pass a law that required
[02:12:37.395 --> 02:12:54.045]  Just the basic minimum standards of informed consent to be applied to nursing homes in those kinds of situations because what we were seeing was that any elder that was checked into one of these situations was required to sign what was called a blanket consent for any medical treatment and that included psych drugs.
[02:12:54.365 --> 02:13:03.791]  So all these people were being placed on psych drugs and over 50% of the elders in these nursing homes and assisted living facilities are on psych drugs and they're not even told
[02:13:04.335 --> 02:13:09.759]  Or they're responsible parties if somebody else is making the decisions and is not even told the drug and the effects.
[02:13:09.779 --> 02:13:13.061]  So at least in Texas we've got a law that says you have to at least do that.
[02:13:13.441 --> 02:13:16.123]  So yeah, it's a common practice and it's part of the dynamic.
[02:13:16.343 --> 02:13:31.933]  And the other thing with this Freedom Commission and the Texas Medical Algorithm Project is that 70% of the profits from a lot of these drugs are from government funding, specifically Medicaid and Medicare.
[02:13:32.629 --> 02:13:35.431]  And they're required to use these specific drugs.
[02:13:36.052 --> 02:13:38.174]  So it's all set up.
[02:13:38.194 --> 02:13:39.535]  So you have a federal law.
[02:13:39.555 --> 02:13:43.238]  You have a federal law to go in there and watch out.
[02:13:43.258 --> 02:13:47.801]  So you have a federal law, not a doctor, telling you what to put the kids on.
[02:13:48.142 --> 02:13:49.483]  Just because it's corporate welfare.
[02:13:50.083 --> 02:13:56.328]  You have a federal law and then you have the doctors who seem all too happy to sort of fulfill their part of it.
[02:13:56.348 --> 02:13:58.470]  But yeah, it's a corporate welfare very much.
[02:13:58.550 --> 02:14:00.071]  And it's a government.
[02:14:00.552 --> 02:14:01.532]  Yeah, it's a corporate welfare.
[02:14:02.674 --> 02:14:13.019]  Money through Medicaid and Medicare, going directly to the drug company for the drugs that have been mandated to be used.
[02:14:13.359 --> 02:14:24.064]  Well, doctor, they've also caught, with a lot of the elders and sick people, period, HMOs won't give you a surgery you need that's medical, they'll just go here's some Prozac.
[02:14:25.344 --> 02:14:29.106]  Well, part of the whole dynamic of psychiatry is that it acts as a
[02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:34.091]  I had a Marine Corps Sergeant on, Staff Sergeant on, who was in the Sacramento Bee, mowing down children and dying in his arms.
[02:14:57.157 --> 02:14:57.697]  Well, I threatened him.
[02:14:57.777 --> 02:14:59.478]  I said, boy, he's out of the program.
[02:15:26.764 --> 02:15:27.506]  I don't know.
[02:15:36.937 --> 02:15:39.580]  And she says, well your dad was fine, you know.
[02:15:39.820 --> 02:15:46.626]  But the thing is, he's got dementia and he's got a little Alzheimer's and he didn't understand who was poking and prodding him and so forth.
[02:15:47.026 --> 02:15:50.550]  And naturally he's going to be a little hostile, pulling away and not wanting it.
[02:15:50.890 --> 02:15:54.333]  And so they took that as a sign that he's got mental problems.
[02:15:54.353 --> 02:15:54.713]  Exactly.
[02:15:54.793 --> 02:16:00.719]  And so I just want to warn everybody, watch your loved ones, especially when they go to the hospital.
[02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:03.101]  Are they in the nursing home or assisted living?
[02:16:03.702 --> 02:16:04.582]  Watch their record.
[02:16:04.823 --> 02:16:05.743]  No, I hear you, Kathy.
[02:16:06.184 --> 02:16:08.005]  Thanks for the call and doing the right thing for your father.
[02:16:08.025 --> 02:16:13.249]  I mean, it's like an old elephant that they stick in a cage and he's depressed, swinging his trunk back and forth.
[02:16:13.289 --> 02:16:15.511]  I mean, do we go put the elephant on Prozac?
[02:16:15.531 --> 02:16:22.336]  You know, it's like when I go buy a new puppy when one of my dogs dies, you know, in 10 years, and the puppy's chewing on my hand and running around happy.
[02:16:22.496 --> 02:16:27.419]  Do I put the young mammal on a drug to inhibit his brain because he shouldn't be hyperactive?
[02:16:27.439 --> 02:16:28.620]  I mean, that's normal behavior.
[02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:29.561]  Is it not, Doctor?
[02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:33.708]  I had a job in a nursing home and it lasted two months before I got fired.
[02:16:33.748 --> 02:16:35.150]  I saw it over and over again.
[02:16:35.210 --> 02:16:38.035]  I have an article on my website, it's called Nursing Home Blues.
[02:16:38.736 --> 02:16:41.301]  So yeah, it's over and over again.
[02:16:41.361 --> 02:16:44.266]  Especially the relatively powerless populations, the elders.
[02:16:44.673 --> 02:16:51.196]  And then the other side of what Kathy could have said, watch your loved ones, but also not only in nursing homes, but watch them in the public schools as well.
[02:16:51.216 --> 02:16:53.097]  And we do this to the most defenseless.
[02:16:53.137 --> 02:17:01.340]  Jesus Christ said, suffer the little children, be good to them, don't abuse them, or it's better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and throw it in the deepest sea.
[02:17:02.061 --> 02:17:04.902]  And look at who this system like wolves goes after first, doctor.
[02:17:04.922 --> 02:17:08.183]  Do I have a minute to tell you a personal example?
[02:17:08.383 --> 02:17:09.924]  Well, let's break and we've got to do it then.
[02:17:10.564 --> 02:17:14.066]  We're going to break in 25 seconds, but folks, understand.
[02:17:15.003 --> 02:17:16.884]  I mean, we target the weakest first.
[02:17:16.924 --> 02:17:18.144]  That's what the globalists do.
[02:17:18.805 --> 02:17:21.186]  This is such a... The Nazis did that!
[02:17:21.446 --> 02:17:22.886]  And the captive populations.
[02:17:23.066 --> 02:17:24.807]  The schools, the nursing homes, the prisons.
[02:17:25.147 --> 02:17:29.669]  Wherever you've got a captive population, you know, that you can work on.
[02:17:30.489 --> 02:17:35.051]  We'll talk about that when we get back, and go to Leon, or Logan, Fred, John, and many others.

[02:20:45.763 --> 02:20:47.285]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:20:47.465 --> 02:20:48.587]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:20:48.787 --> 02:20:52.192]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:52.292 --> 02:20:52.732]  Phenol!
[02:20:53.053 --> 02:21:00.122]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:21:00.663 --> 02:21:04.526]  The FDA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:21:04.666 --> 02:21:05.107]  Fragrance?
[02:21:05.487 --> 02:21:10.251]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:21:10.391 --> 02:21:15.075]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.

[02:21:18.098 --> 02:21:21.520]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[02:21:46.471 --> 02:21:55.873]  Yeah, it's not a personal story in the sense of my family, but it's a current situation.
[02:21:55.893 --> 02:21:58.594]  I won't mention her name because it's in the courts right now here in Travis County.
[02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:19.753]  There's a good example of what happens with this whole screening situation.
[02:22:19.773 --> 02:22:33.619]  There's a current study out of the University of Texas that got permission to go into the schools in Pflugerville and Georgetown, which are suburb cities of Austin, and do a screening of the kids in the middle schools there.
[02:22:34.520 --> 02:22:36.401]  So one example is a 13-year-old.
[02:22:36.421 --> 02:22:43.244]  So they went in to do this screening, so-called depression screening, and the first note that went home to the parents
[02:22:43.972 --> 02:22:55.882]  And then two months later, all of a sudden, the psychiatrist out of UT who runs the program calls the school and says, you know, this child is severely depressed.
[02:22:55.902 --> 02:22:58.564]  You need to go immediately into the hospital.
[02:22:59.225 --> 02:23:10.574]  And so the school calls, so the letter goes to the parents, and so it's a letter, you know, it's a crisis and they can send a letter, you know.
[02:23:12.058 --> 02:23:19.860]  We can talk about it on Monday.
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:24.062]  In the meantime, CPS is called, Child Protection Services, they come in.
[02:23:25.122 --> 02:23:33.844]  They take the child immediately to Austin State Hospital where the child stays for a couple of months and ends up in a residential treatment center in San Antonio.
[02:23:34.584 --> 02:23:39.826]  The story is that this child, since they've been in the state hospital slash residential treatment center,
[02:23:40.669 --> 02:23:48.457]  Has been forcibly drugged with neuroleptics, has been restrained 39 times without any kind of doctor's order.
[02:23:49.518 --> 02:23:52.982]  This came to the attention of a lawyer who took on the case.
[02:23:53.022 --> 02:23:59.729]  It came to the attention of the legislative head of a committee that's investigating CPS.
[02:24:00.569 --> 02:24:03.072]  She got them engaged.
[02:24:03.112 --> 02:24:03.913]  They got to court.
[02:24:04.383 --> 02:24:19.232]  You know they're getting an agreement to gradually extricate the girl from this situation but it all started with a depression screening in the school, yanked the child out of the home into the care of CPS, into the state hospital, forcibly drugged, restrained 39 times, all
[02:24:21.810 --> 02:24:22.610]  Unnecessary.
[02:24:22.650 --> 02:24:25.151]  This girl apparently basically was just a real spirited character.
[02:24:25.171 --> 02:24:25.611]  She was defiant.
[02:24:25.631 --> 02:24:27.712]  She would talk and state her point of view.
[02:24:43.482 --> 02:24:56.110]  We see, and so then they come up with that she's suicidally depressed, you know, and since that time, the whole time, there's no record, no history of any place where she said she was suicidal or appeared suicidal.
[02:24:56.531 --> 02:25:09.399]  We see it as a way to circumvent the law, which now says that you can't call CPS, you know, and you can't force a parent just because a child is not, and a parent refuses a psych drug.
[02:25:09.599 --> 02:25:12.181]  But if they're considered dangerous to themselves or others,
[02:25:13.024 --> 02:25:13.545]  You can.
[02:25:13.885 --> 02:25:18.208]  So even though we don't think she was, we think this is a way for them to circumvent the law.
[02:25:18.248 --> 02:25:21.911]  Well, we've got to take a call here in a second, but I just want to add to this.
[02:25:21.931 --> 02:25:22.512]  Go ahead.
[02:25:22.692 --> 02:25:27.176]  That again, they get a lot more money when they do this than if they just take the child, period.
[02:25:27.676 --> 02:25:34.262]  And I'm sure you've seen the articles out of Florida where they grab the toddlers, and if they cry, they put them in mental institutions.
[02:25:34.742 --> 02:25:36.584]  If they cry for mommy, that shows depression.
[02:25:36.624 --> 02:25:38.946]  They're putting toddlers on antipsychotics at age two.
[02:25:39.662 --> 02:25:44.304]  The Florida situation has been exposed and now it's being exposed here in Texas as well.
[02:25:47.226 --> 02:25:55.370]  So these screenings are not any kind of benign looking for people in trouble so we can... No, it's looking for somebody to snatch.
[02:25:55.570 --> 02:25:56.571]  Logan just hung up.
[02:25:56.631 --> 02:25:58.132]  Logan, we were going to you, but you hung up.
[02:25:58.412 --> 02:25:59.592]  Fred in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:59.612 --> 02:26:00.313]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:26:00.833 --> 02:26:03.534]  Alex, calling from the Cradle of Liberty.
[02:26:03.995 --> 02:26:04.335]  Yes.
[02:26:05.896 --> 02:26:06.276]  Alright.
[02:26:07.300 --> 02:26:08.341]  Uh, just one thing.
[02:26:08.381 --> 02:26:09.541]  I know you have a lot of calls.
[02:26:09.601 --> 02:26:09.961]  All right.
[02:26:10.321 --> 02:26:18.264]  Patriot 2, Section 127 allows the government to take over coroner's and medical examiner's operations.
[02:26:18.544 --> 02:26:19.325]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[02:26:19.385 --> 02:26:20.545]  Whenever they see fit.
[02:26:20.845 --> 02:26:26.827]  And the other thing is that Section 303 sets up a national DNA database.
[02:26:27.588 --> 02:26:28.268]  For everybody!
[02:26:28.768 --> 02:26:29.488]  Right.
[02:26:29.789 --> 02:26:30.929]  And the fact is that
[02:26:31.465 --> 02:26:39.767]  The predicate of Patriot 2 is that because of the security needs, they're going to overrule anything to the contrary.
[02:26:39.827 --> 02:26:48.209]  And the Supreme Court, a couple months ago, wiped out the mandatory giving of DNA by arrestees.
[02:26:48.689 --> 02:26:52.630]  But they're going to wipe that out, and they probably have.
[02:26:53.250 --> 02:27:00.952]  That's all I wanted to say, that because of this predicate of security, they then will wipe out any prohibition to their powers
[02:27:01.468 --> 02:27:02.048]  No, I hear you.
[02:27:02.288 --> 02:27:10.833]  And really, Doctor, isn't it a form of Philip K. Dickey and pre-crime to say you might be planning something, you might be crazy?
[02:27:11.533 --> 02:27:15.475]  I have a friend named Rodney Yoder, and he I can't talk about.
[02:27:15.535 --> 02:27:19.137]  He's been locked up for 11 years now in Illinois.
[02:27:19.157 --> 02:27:25.941]  He's a very strong person, so he's managed to resist taking any psych drugs, and he's written several
[02:27:26.414 --> 02:27:27.095]  We'll be right back!
[02:27:27.135 --> 02:27:27.695]  We're on the march.
[02:27:27.735 --> 02:27:28.976]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:28.996 --> 02:27:30.617]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.391 --> 02:27:49.412]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:27:49.733 --> 02:27:54.655]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:27:54.915 --> 02:27:59.257]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:27:59.557 --> 02:28:08.481]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:28:08.681 --> 02:28:12.303]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:28:12.583 --> 02:28:17.625]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:28:17.905 --> 02:28:24.648]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:28:25.129 --> 02:28:25.669]  What about you?
[02:28:26.434 --> 02:28:31.777]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:28:46.275 --> 02:28:47.595]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[02:28:47.775 --> 02:28:51.516]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[02:28:51.697 --> 02:28:55.418]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[02:28:55.718 --> 02:28:59.339]  Hundreds of NT Oil Additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[02:28:59.579 --> 02:29:04.000]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:08.141]  NT Oil Additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[02:29:08.361 --> 02:29:09.081]  It really works!
[02:29:09.341 --> 02:29:15.463]  NT Oil Additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[02:29:15.723 --> 02:29:16.844]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[02:29:17.144 --> 02:29:19.665]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[02:29:19.825 --> 02:29:23.086]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and air tools.
[02:29:23.286 --> 02:29:28.348]  Gearboxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[02:29:28.528 --> 02:29:29.969]  Diesel engines thrive on it too.
[02:29:30.149 --> 02:29:34.251]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.
[02:29:35.111 --> 02:29:36.512]  We accept MasterCard and Visa.

[02:29:41.414 --> 02:29:41.674]  That's 800-647-4079.
[02:29:46.394 --> 02:29:47.394]  It's finally here!
[02:29:47.534 --> 02:29:48.495]  Spring has arrived!
[02:29:48.695 --> 02:29:51.656]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:29:51.896 --> 02:29:55.337]  This year though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:29:55.537 --> 02:30:03.700]  I grow my own seed now from year to year and you can too with the help of the Ark Institute's brand new 40 variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:30:03.960 --> 02:30:07.681]  With Ark's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:30:07.901 --> 02:30:12.923]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:30:13.203 --> 02:30:17.706]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[02:30:17.906 --> 02:30:21.969]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.

[02:31:09.494 --> 02:31:13.356]  The New World Order is upon us, my friends.
[02:31:13.496 --> 02:31:16.998]  Total control, systematic dehumanization, enslavement.
[02:31:18.079 --> 02:31:22.381]  Slavery is the norm in modern human history, and even ancient human history.
[02:31:23.322 --> 02:31:29.526]  And now they've just gotten more sophisticated at it, using propaganda or different levels of mind control to convince you to go along with it.
[02:31:30.046 --> 02:31:35.329]  I only have time to go to Logan, John, Jim, and Galeb, because I want to get more into
[02:31:35.996 --> 02:31:43.941]  The whistleblower in Pennsylvania, Alan Jones, and others, and this big announcement Bush is going to make to start forcibly testing children and adults.
[02:31:44.541 --> 02:31:45.842]  They even admit it's a captive audience.
[02:31:45.862 --> 02:31:48.424]  But before we... I'm going to just go to your calls quickly here.
[02:31:48.684 --> 02:31:53.287]  Before we do that, Dr. Breeding, you've written several books, but I carry two of them.
[02:31:54.864 --> 02:32:05.347]  And tell us about those two books, and then I would direct people to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or the toll-free number to get them, because you're right here in Austin and I carry the book.
[02:32:06.168 --> 02:32:08.188]  Tell folks about the two books that I carry.
[02:32:09.229 --> 02:32:20.292]  The first one's called The Wildest Cult Make the Best Horses, and I like that title because it's this thing, spirited young people make spirited adults, so let's defend them and protect them.
[02:32:21.067 --> 02:32:21.427]  I think so.
[02:32:35.231 --> 02:32:41.813]  Largely as support in terms of how to really think well about our children and remember who children really are and how to connect with them.
[02:32:41.873 --> 02:32:44.234]  And it gets into the Ritalin and the Prozac and all of that.
[02:32:44.274 --> 02:32:45.354]  It's a preeminent book.
[02:32:46.134 --> 02:32:47.915]  Then there's another book I carry that you have.
[02:32:48.155 --> 02:32:50.335]  The other book, I love it a lot.
[02:32:50.435 --> 02:32:55.157]  It's my new one and it's got a picture of my daughter on the cover, which makes me fond of it of course.
[02:32:55.197 --> 02:32:57.638]  But it's called True Nature and Great Misunderstandings.
[02:32:58.498 --> 02:33:02.459]  And the idea there is that we tend to see the world not as it is, but as we are.
[02:33:03.186 --> 02:33:03.787]  We're good to go!
[02:33:27.020 --> 02:33:35.764]  It's a reminder of what children really like, and a support for people who engage with young children in terms of how to connect with them.
[02:33:35.824 --> 02:33:38.585]  And we have both the books separately, or we have them in a package dealer.
[02:33:38.605 --> 02:33:40.606]  I think you said like $5 if you get both of them.
[02:33:40.926 --> 02:33:41.526]  It's a great book.
[02:33:41.566 --> 02:33:43.687]  It supports Dr. Breding and also supports what I'm doing.
[02:33:43.727 --> 02:33:49.849]  It's on the shopping cart at InfoWars.com or PresentPlanet.com or just call the toll-free number 1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:56.647 --> 02:33:58.729]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:33:58.749 --> 02:34:05.774]  And again, folks, I've also made 10 films, written a book myself, published another book.
[02:34:06.375 --> 02:34:07.676]  I carry a lot of other new videos.
[02:34:07.716 --> 02:34:10.178]  I'm carrying George Humphreys' 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[02:34:11.199 --> 02:34:26.833]  In Game of the Illuminati, your choice, fear or love, great new video, 1995 on VHS or DVD, get a free color 80 plus page booklet that goes with the film, that goes over all the evidence, and you get a second copy for $14.95, and you get three
[02:34:28.877 --> 02:34:33.320]  Of the color booklets, so $34.95, three color booklets, two of the videos, one for yourself, one for a friend.
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:42.405]  That's also on the website, or you can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:43.965 --> 02:34:45.826]  But go to the website, look for Dr. Brady's materials.
[02:34:46.087 --> 02:34:47.247]  Believe me, you'll be impressed.
[02:34:47.267 --> 02:34:48.028]  You won't be disappointed.
[02:34:48.768 --> 02:34:50.149]  Logan in Texas was there.
[02:34:50.249 --> 02:34:51.430]  Logan, you go ahead.
[02:34:51.470 --> 02:34:52.070]  Thanks for holding.
[02:34:52.782 --> 02:35:11.807]  I used to work lawn maintenance at a daycare center and eventually like one summer they needed some help in a classroom so I went in the classroom and I was working with the kids some and I noticed that one of the kids who was getting into a lot of trouble and causing a lot of problems, she was also probably like one of the smartest kids in her group as far as her age.
[02:35:11.827 --> 02:35:12.547]  She was a kindergartner.
[02:35:12.567 --> 02:35:14.507]  She was like smarter than the other kids.
[02:35:14.527 --> 02:35:17.528]  She was the only one who could really like listen to what I was saying or repeat things that I said.
[02:35:17.548 --> 02:35:21.609]  She was just like obviously like the smarter and stronger kid.
[02:35:22.373 --> 02:35:27.234]  And, um, she was getting into some trouble, and like, I didn't mind, like, she was still, you know, she was a good kid.
[02:35:27.914 --> 02:35:39.736]  And what I saw, eventually, was I saw, like, a triple theme of the doctor, the school, and the daycare, advising her mom, and kind of, like, ushering her along, and putting her on Ritalin.
[02:35:40.417 --> 02:35:44.537]  And when the kids... And then now, at lunchtime, there's lots of little cups coming out with the pills in them.
[02:35:45.317 --> 02:35:47.778]  Yeah, and the thing is, is that these kids, they get dropped off at school,
[02:35:48.433 --> 02:35:53.654]  Like early in the morning and their parents work all day and they go to daycare and they get picked up at like six o'clock.
[02:35:54.114 --> 02:35:55.575]  They spend like two hours with their parents.
[02:35:55.615 --> 02:35:56.715]  The rest of the day, where are they?
[02:35:56.755 --> 02:35:57.675]  Who are they with?
[02:35:57.715 --> 02:36:03.536]  Daycares are nests of evil where the lowest common denominator takes over.
[02:36:04.197 --> 02:36:12.158]  Again, you throw 20 puppies in a pen together and the behavior is going to get out of control.
[02:36:12.178 --> 02:36:13.979]  That's what small mammals, young mammals...
[02:36:15.754 --> 02:36:18.976]  You saw her being triple teamed, and that's a good description.
[02:36:19.076 --> 02:36:22.658]  And then you saw the basic dynamic beyond that.
[02:36:22.818 --> 02:36:23.899]  So you're seeing it clearly.
[02:36:23.939 --> 02:36:24.399]  That's good.
[02:36:24.619 --> 02:36:28.541]  What did the child act like after being put on the pharmacological cocaine?
[02:36:29.542 --> 02:36:34.225]  Well, I saw something that was also kind of weird, too, because I used to go pick up the kids or whatever.
[02:36:34.245 --> 02:36:40.208]  I kind of thought that the place really creeped me out, you know, and I really made that clear to my boss that I didn't think we were helping these kids at all.
[02:36:40.228 --> 02:36:42.469]  I mean, they fed them junk food, and it was just not a good deal.
[02:36:44.011 --> 02:36:58.204]  Well, I picked the kids up one time and I noticed that they were handing out these spy kits to the kids and they're giving them out to them for free and they called it like a, what do they call it when you go and the whole school goes and they have a big thing and they all meet up in the cafeteria and whatever.
[02:36:58.244 --> 02:37:01.467]  Yeah, it's a field trip or an auditorium meeting.
[02:37:02.248 --> 02:37:10.355]  They're giving all the kids microphones to listen in on people and I thought it was really weird because they're giving this to kids, they're not giving out books, they're giving out
[02:37:10.714 --> 02:37:12.194]  You know, anything educational.
[02:37:12.214 --> 02:37:13.295]  They're giving them spy kits.
[02:37:13.355 --> 02:37:14.335]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:37:14.375 --> 02:37:15.095]  Let me stop you.
[02:37:15.115 --> 02:37:16.615]  Go to a children's store.
[02:37:17.475 --> 02:37:18.416]  And you look at the toys.
[02:37:18.436 --> 02:37:20.496]  There's whole sections now on spying.
[02:37:20.936 --> 02:37:23.457]  And Time for Kids, you know, Time Magazine in the schools.
[02:37:23.657 --> 02:37:24.657]  How to be a spy.
[02:37:24.717 --> 02:37:25.817]  How to spy on your parents.
[02:37:26.177 --> 02:37:27.218]  And I'm actually aware of that.
[02:37:27.258 --> 02:37:28.958]  I didn't know it was going on in preschools.
[02:37:29.478 --> 02:37:30.758]  I knew that they encouraged that.
[02:37:30.818 --> 02:37:32.579]  Again, that's right out of 1984.
[02:37:33.039 --> 02:37:34.539]  Training them how to be spies.
[02:37:34.559 --> 02:37:37.120]  So what were they telling them to do with the spy kits?
[02:37:37.160 --> 02:37:37.860]  Who provided it?
[02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:51.093]  That's the thing is that the school is providing and I was asked to teach it and the thing is is that like we're living in a society where it's they pretty much promote cowards and idiots and you know and just mediocre people who like don't even know what they're doing.
[02:37:51.213 --> 02:37:51.973]  Like I'll be like what is this?
[02:37:51.993 --> 02:37:52.893]  Like what are you trying to do with this?
[02:37:52.913 --> 02:37:54.733]  I'll have to teach like well I didn't really even think about it.
[02:37:54.753 --> 02:37:55.754]  It was just fun for you know.
[02:37:56.214 --> 02:37:59.334]  And I look at on the on the and this is the funny thing is like they're not even really hiding it.
[02:37:59.694 --> 02:38:01.695]  You look on there and who are the kids spying on?
[02:38:02.075 --> 02:38:06.976]  It shows a picture of these two kids like working together and spying like looking through a fence and it looks like their neighbor's fence.
[02:38:07.406 --> 02:38:10.088]  I'm looking through the fence with a little microphone and I'm like hearing it.
[02:38:10.508 --> 02:38:10.808]  You notice?
[02:38:10.868 --> 02:38:13.910]  And they show a little circle in the fence where you can see who they're spying on.
[02:38:14.290 --> 02:38:17.772]  And it shows this guy in like blue jeans and a white shirt and a construction helmet.
[02:38:18.172 --> 02:38:18.973]  Like some white guy.
[02:38:19.113 --> 02:38:21.254]  And he's like has his hands up like he's talking to people.
[02:38:21.374 --> 02:38:22.054]  Like a speaker.
[02:38:22.575 --> 02:38:23.235]  And that's what it shows.
[02:38:23.255 --> 02:38:25.376]  It shows like some like construction worker talking to people.
[02:38:25.396 --> 02:38:25.656]  Alright.
[02:38:25.696 --> 02:38:26.337]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:26.397 --> 02:38:26.997]  I appreciate it.
[02:38:27.557 --> 02:38:28.218]  Dr. Breeding?
[02:38:28.238 --> 02:38:29.559]  Chris Logan, we need your help, man.
[02:38:31.239 --> 02:38:31.540]  Yeah.
[02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:35.462]  I mean that's... Dr. Breeding, were you aware they're training the kids how to be spies?
[02:38:36.281 --> 02:38:40.885]  No, but I'm very aware of the whole surveillance dynamic.
[02:38:40.965 --> 02:38:46.229]  In fact, I've got a book in my hand called The Soft Cage by Christian Parenti on the surveillance in America.
[02:38:46.249 --> 02:38:46.990]  By interviewing?
[02:38:47.450 --> 02:38:49.912]  Yeah, he's great.
[02:38:50.653 --> 02:38:52.975]  So it doesn't surprise me.
[02:38:52.995 --> 02:39:03.063]  I wasn't aware of that as a regular dynamic, but when you think about it, the whole first thing that he described and this whole conversation on the Freedom Commission is all about
[02:39:03.752 --> 02:39:16.760]  You know the expansion of intrusion into families instead of schools just being a place of education and more and more becoming a place where the state can intrude and impinge on parental rights and family rights.
[02:39:17.280 --> 02:39:20.922]  So it's all that can be seen from the point of view of the surveillance industry.
[02:39:22.133 --> 02:39:26.856]  With the particularly insidious aspect of placing all these kids on mind-controlling drugs.
[02:39:27.016 --> 02:39:36.542]  And then on top of it, we have the same corporations owning the drugs, owning the surveillance, funding and arming the police, and owning the private prisons.
[02:39:37.042 --> 02:39:40.364]  I mean, they're engineering the whole economy to feed us through a meat grinder.
[02:39:42.225 --> 02:39:43.346]  John in Ohio.
[02:39:43.426 --> 02:39:44.186]  John, go ahead.
[02:39:45.027 --> 02:39:49.029]  Alex, there's another person who does some of this work, Dr. Peter Bregan.
[02:39:49.745 --> 02:39:50.566]  Yeah, he's great.
[02:39:59.508 --> 02:40:00.208]  And the rest of it.
[02:40:00.328 --> 02:40:15.737]  But I especially love the way you are bundling and integrating all of these issues together because so many people that are against the drug companies from a health food perspective won't take their blinders off and realize that this is not just the drug companies.
[02:40:15.777 --> 02:40:22.780]  This is a military, industrial, pharmaceutical, media, CIA complex that is involved in all of these issues.
[02:40:23.301 --> 02:40:25.322]  And I think it's interesting to note that
[02:40:26.078 --> 02:40:34.860]  The main CI enabler for mind control, MK Ultra Programs, was the president of the American Psychiatric Association years ago.
[02:40:34.980 --> 02:40:36.880]  Yeah, it was Ewing Cameron.
[02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:37.880]  Cameron, yes.
[02:40:38.100 --> 02:40:40.841]  Civilly convicted of kidnapping people and brainwashing them.
[02:40:41.061 --> 02:40:53.323]  Yes, and I think they are converted into this kind of high priest authority figures by the corporate media, which interlocks with them, to sort of intimidate people into not resisting any of these kinds of fascist practices.
[02:40:53.884 --> 02:40:55.544]  And when you look at
[02:40:56.184 --> 02:41:06.131]  The fact that I think it's this kind of suck-up syndrome, this brown-nose factor, where people are said that if you identify with them, you'll get some reflected glory.
[02:41:06.931 --> 02:41:13.896]  And in effect, all they're doing is setting themselves up for being victimized by them.
[02:41:14.016 --> 02:41:20.821]  And you know, the people like even Alawi, if the media had any kind of integrity,
[02:41:21.320 --> 02:41:32.531]  When it interviews this guy, it would say, what are you doing up there as an appointed puppet of the United States government when you're a terrorist that murdered children on school buses and movie theaters and car bombings?
[02:41:32.591 --> 02:41:39.217]  Yet the media, as long as they've got a title, whether it's a psychiatrist, head of the American Psychiatric Association,
[02:41:39.557 --> 02:41:43.878]  They respectably go on bended knee and say, you know, what is your opinion?
[02:41:44.418 --> 02:41:45.998]  Okay, John, fabulous points.
[02:41:46.458 --> 02:41:47.118]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:47.158 --> 02:41:48.359]  Dr. Breeden, comments to that?
[02:41:48.519 --> 02:41:58.360]  Yeah, well, I just appreciate the comments a lot, you know, and I want to acknowledge that there's a book by Peter Breggin, you mentioned, John, it's called The War Against Children of Color.
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:04.941]  There was a previous incarnation of this freedom initiative, you know, that was called the Federal Violence Initiative.
[02:42:04.981 --> 02:42:08.782]  We call it the Racist Violence Initiative, but it was an initiative to scream
[02:42:09.384 --> 02:42:14.086]  Yeah, and so now at least you could say it's an equal opportunity thing.
[02:42:14.126 --> 02:42:16.867]  We're going to screen everybody, you know.
[02:42:16.907 --> 02:42:22.550]  But he's right and I think it is important to integrate these things, you know, that it's not just psychiatry.
[02:42:35.191 --> 02:42:43.135]  And there's a lot of people who kind of see through some of the problems with war or military or whatever, but don't see the psychiatry.
[02:42:43.175 --> 02:42:51.540]  And on the other hand, there's some people who see the psychiatry, but just from the point of view of health products, like you said, and it all... So I appreciate his comments a lot.
[02:42:51.660 --> 02:42:53.921]  Yeah, two quick final calls.
[02:42:54.081 --> 02:42:58.303]  I want to get more into the Freedom Initiative and Alan Jones that Dr. Brinning's talked to.
[02:42:58.343 --> 02:42:59.804]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:42:59.824 --> 02:43:00.704]  Quickly, Tim, go ahead.
[02:43:00.724 --> 02:43:01.405]  Hi, Alex.
[02:43:01.445 --> 02:43:02.325]  I talked to you yesterday.
[02:43:02.345 --> 02:43:03.466]  I'm living with the Wirehead.
[02:43:04.042 --> 02:43:05.344]  She said she'd come on your show.
[02:43:05.544 --> 02:43:11.053]  Oh, you know what, and that sheet of paper I wrote down your number, I'm going to have to put you on hold and get it again.
[02:43:11.113 --> 02:43:12.496]  I apologize, I get so busy.
[02:43:12.956 --> 02:43:17.363]  Yeah, Dr. Breeding, we had another, we had a psychiatrist on yesterday in the head of
[02:43:18.439 --> 02:43:21.880]  A major group, Psych Rights, on exposing all of this.
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:26.782]  The year-long implantable Prozac-type drug, so you can escape it.
[02:43:27.282 --> 02:43:30.663]  And now they're saying they're going to put a wire up in the nerves, into the brain.
[02:43:30.943 --> 02:43:34.925]  They're getting FDA approval to make us all feel better and behave better.
[02:43:35.085 --> 02:43:35.665]  Comments to that?
[02:43:37.310 --> 02:43:43.315]  The comments are that it's just more of the manufacture of madness and more of the creation of products.
[02:43:44.256 --> 02:43:50.442]  Basically, just what you said, that life is about challenge.
[02:43:50.902 --> 02:43:56.107]  In this world, it's about the fact that if you confront it, you're not going to be happy a lot of the time.
[02:43:56.127 --> 02:43:57.548]  There's a lot of horror going down.
[02:43:58.089 --> 02:43:59.510]  The future is in peril.
[02:43:59.770 --> 02:44:01.792]  The future of our children's lives is in peril.
[02:44:02.012 --> 02:44:03.093]  You're going to be sad.
[02:44:03.133 --> 02:44:05.555]  You're going to be angry if you confront that.
[02:44:05.735 --> 02:44:07.656]  A happy pill is not going to take that away.
[02:44:08.017 --> 02:44:13.661]  The only solution is to do your very best to make a difference for the sake of your children.
[02:44:14.001 --> 02:44:15.723]  It's not about an implant in your head.
[02:44:15.783 --> 02:44:17.364]  It's not about an electroshock.
[02:44:17.424 --> 02:44:18.725]  It's not about a Prozac.
[02:44:19.079 --> 02:44:30.850]  That's just part of the corporate marketing that's going to keep you in line and say the problem if you feel bad is there's something wrong with you because America is great and you should be happy because you live in the land of the free.
[02:44:31.951 --> 02:44:38.537]  And the truth is that you live in a land that is threatening the future of our planet and the future of our children.
[02:44:38.914 --> 02:44:42.075]  And you better get involved and help them to do something about it.
[02:44:42.435 --> 02:44:44.136]  SPM 927, what's up with that?
[02:44:44.196 --> 02:44:46.697]  They want to do a research study with the new drug, SPM 927.
[02:44:46.757 --> 02:44:48.258]  Can you tell me anything about it?
[02:44:48.578 --> 02:44:49.278]  No, I don't.
[02:44:49.418 --> 02:44:50.959]  Yeah, the psychiatrist yesterday didn't know.
[02:44:50.979 --> 02:44:53.400]  I mean, there's thousands of new drugs being studied, sir.
[02:44:53.440 --> 02:44:55.181]  There's no way to know all of it.
[02:44:55.281 --> 02:44:55.541]  You know what?
[02:44:55.561 --> 02:44:56.101]  I apologize.
[02:44:56.201 --> 02:44:57.141]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:44:57.201 --> 02:44:57.942]  I'm going to get your number.
[02:44:58.502 --> 02:45:03.744]  And you're saying the lady you live with, who has one of these wires, these ports... Going on two years now.
[02:45:04.264 --> 02:45:05.705]  Yeah, and all this... You know what?
[02:45:06.408 --> 02:45:09.451]  I promise you, I promise you, I'll call you as soon as the show ends.
[02:45:09.912 --> 02:45:11.854]  Scott, get Tim's number.
[02:45:11.894 --> 02:45:13.375]  I'm going to call him when the show ends.
[02:45:15.017 --> 02:45:15.618]  Thank you, Tim.
[02:45:16.118 --> 02:45:18.581]  Let's talk, last caller, Gayla in Missouri.
[02:45:18.621 --> 02:45:19.381]  Gayla, go ahead.
[02:45:19.401 --> 02:45:20.503]  Hi, Alex.
[02:45:20.903 --> 02:45:21.163]  Yes.
[02:45:21.624 --> 02:45:26.689]  I just wanted to make a point that these teachers in the school system are pushing these drugs on the kids.
[02:45:27.544 --> 02:45:32.826]  Hey, I had them push him on me and I had literally a 100 grade point average when I was a senior.
[02:45:33.006 --> 02:45:36.467]  Well, my son, when he was in second grade, he was having problems learning to read.
[02:45:37.167 --> 02:45:40.949]  And the teacher, she took it upon herself to decide that he had ADD.
[02:45:41.629 --> 02:45:44.170]  And she wanted us to take him to a local doctor here.
[02:45:44.210 --> 02:45:45.050]  She named names.
[02:45:45.270 --> 02:45:45.710]  Yeah, I love it.
[02:45:45.750 --> 02:45:46.511]  She's a doctor.
[02:45:46.531 --> 02:45:47.431]  She's going to tell you.
[02:45:48.331 --> 02:45:52.432]  And she said, take him down there and they'll put him on this, on Ritalin.
[02:45:52.452 --> 02:45:54.152]  And I said, no, we'll not do it.
[02:45:54.192 --> 02:45:56.793]  Well, she kept on and on to me for about a month.
[02:45:57.153 --> 02:46:03.075]  So finally, my husband, I told him, and he went up there and had a nice talk with her.
[02:46:03.095 --> 02:46:06.075]  And by the time he was done, she wrote a two-page letter apologizing.
[02:46:07.356 --> 02:46:09.236]  I'd encourage you to go to my friends at Able Child.
[02:46:13.584 --> 02:46:16.225]  It's www.ablechild.org.
[02:46:16.605 --> 02:46:24.466]  It's a group of parents from all over the country who have gotten together that have had experiences like yours and are really working to challenge that thing.
[02:46:24.506 --> 02:46:29.587]  Some of them, unfortunately, have had children who died from these drugs and that's what woke them up to it.
[02:46:29.647 --> 02:46:32.788]  Others had more stories like yours where they stood up to it.
[02:46:32.928 --> 02:46:34.288]  It's www.ablechild.org.
[02:46:34.328 --> 02:46:36.669]  It's a strong group of parents who are fighting this thing.
[02:46:36.909 --> 02:46:41.930]  Well, there's a lot of kids that did put their child on them and now my son is a sophomore in high school.
[02:46:42.466 --> 02:46:45.448]  And when I look at these kids, I know who they are because I've talked to the parents.
[02:46:46.049 --> 02:46:46.669]  They're short.
[02:46:46.789 --> 02:46:47.810]  They have not grown.
[02:46:47.830 --> 02:46:50.371]  I mean... Gross depression is one of the effects of stimulants.
[02:46:50.391 --> 02:46:52.413]  Black circles around their eyes.
[02:46:52.433 --> 02:46:54.214]  Some of the boys are like maybe 5'5", 5'7".
[02:46:54.254 --> 02:46:55.215]  My son's 6'2".
[02:46:55.335 --> 02:46:58.297]  And, you know, their parents are tall.
[02:46:58.357 --> 02:47:01.119]  So I know that, you know, they probably should be taller than that.
[02:47:01.159 --> 02:47:02.380]  But you can tell.
[02:47:02.420 --> 02:47:03.640]  You can look at them and you can tell.
[02:47:03.660 --> 02:47:07.303]  And literally estimated thousands.
[02:47:08.310 --> 02:47:22.364]  I've read the reports where a 12-year-old on Ritalin is playing tennis, the heart explodes, the coroner says, yeah, it was the Ritalin, and then nothing ever happens.
[02:47:22.824 --> 02:47:29.250]  Ritalindeath.com is the website of my friend Larry Smith, whose son Matthew had exactly that experience.
[02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:29.651]  He died.
[02:47:29.671 --> 02:47:30.872]  He was riding his skateboard.
[02:47:32.046 --> 02:47:33.387]  RiddleInDeath.com?
[02:47:33.527 --> 02:47:33.927]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:34.287 --> 02:47:39.970]  Well, I had studied the New World Order for years, probably started in the late 80s, so I knew what was going on.
[02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:44.652]  So we, you know, I knew it all tied in, so we wasn't about to go that way.
[02:47:44.672 --> 02:47:45.132]  Good for you.
[02:47:45.713 --> 02:47:48.894]  But, you know, I see it in these parents, and they're just doing it.
[02:47:48.914 --> 02:47:50.235]  They're just letting, they're putting them on it.
[02:47:50.255 --> 02:47:53.816]  They're just, you know, the teachers are pushing it, and they're just going right along with it.
[02:47:54.096 --> 02:47:57.138]  Look, I have, I have neighbors, people I've known for decades.
[02:47:57.805 --> 02:48:01.567]  Who, you know, have three sons, four sons, two daughters and a son.
[02:48:02.047 --> 02:48:04.488]  And the mother's six foot, the father's six foot four.
[02:48:04.808 --> 02:48:11.471]  The child on Ritalin, who's now 18, is a foot and a half shorter than the rest of his family, and is a gibbering, demonic midget.
[02:48:11.892 --> 02:48:16.194]  And I'm not trying to be mean, but folks, I mean, you better not put your children on this.
[02:48:16.234 --> 02:48:17.194]  What is wrong with you?
[02:48:17.694 --> 02:48:21.136]  But now, Dr. Breeding, they want anti-psychotics that are even worse!
[02:48:21.416 --> 02:48:22.036]  They're even worse.
[02:48:22.096 --> 02:48:26.338]  They cause permanent neurological damage in almost anyone who takes them for very long.
[02:48:26.358 --> 02:48:27.439]  It's just absolutely...
[02:48:29.036 --> 02:48:30.237]  Criminal.
[02:48:46.425 --> 02:48:50.751]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.951 --> 02:48:55.377]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.518 --> 02:48:59.923]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.944 --> 02:49:01.305]  The New World Order.
[02:49:03.067 --> 02:49:07.288]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.348 --> 02:49:14.291]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.411 --> 02:49:16.432]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.852 --> 02:49:27.158]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.418 --> 02:49:32.781]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:49:46.477 --> 02:49:49.478]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.818 --> 02:49:58.641]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.961 --> 02:50:03.643]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:04.103 --> 02:50:10.829]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.230 --> 02:50:23.020]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:27.942]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:28.102 --> 02:50:30.584]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:30.604 --> 02:50:32.424]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:50:35.186 --> 02:50:36.246]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.866 --> 02:50:47.206]  I think so.
[02:51:02.114 --> 02:51:02.755]  We're good to go!
[02:51:31.633 --> 02:51:34.714]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.874 --> 02:51:40.876]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:47.479 --> 02:51:52.621]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:53.281 --> 02:51:55.562]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:57.390 --> 02:51:59.732]  And knowing of a war is half the battle.
[02:51:59.752 --> 02:52:00.832]  Yes, there's a war.
[02:52:01.213 --> 02:52:02.794]  The greatest ever in human history.
[02:52:02.814 --> 02:52:03.594]  The crossroads.
[02:52:04.435 --> 02:52:10.859]  Just briefly in 20 seconds, Dr. Breeding, the name of your two books and why folks should get them.
[02:52:10.879 --> 02:52:12.760]  Wildest Colts Make the Best Horses.
[02:52:15.142 --> 02:52:17.023]  True Nature and Great Misunderstandings.
[02:52:17.844 --> 02:52:25.429]  People should get them because they're my very best thinking really about how to engage with our young people and they bring together
[02:52:25.953 --> 02:52:26.394]  I don't think so.
[02:52:35.367 --> 02:52:43.871]  How to really think about children, and I think they're really good support people in terms of how to deal with the fact that there's not a lot of support for parenting right now in the world.
[02:52:44.451 --> 02:52:45.311]  Well, it's designed.
[02:52:45.351 --> 02:52:48.253]  It's like O'Brien says in 84, we're here to destroy that unit.
[02:52:48.953 --> 02:53:00.878]  Toll-free number to get it, 888-253-3139, or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, and don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv, where this interview will be posted tomorrow, by the way, if you want to hear it.
[02:53:00.898 --> 02:53:02.919]  If you get a book, you're welcome to contact me.
[02:53:03.860 --> 02:53:06.002]  Tell me what you think about it, or ask a question.
[02:53:06.282 --> 02:53:08.524]  And your website is walduscolts.com.
[02:53:08.824 --> 02:53:09.184]  That's right.
[02:53:09.224 --> 02:53:11.566]  Phone numbers, email, all right there, walduscolts.com.
[02:53:11.887 --> 02:53:17.131]  Okay, Alan Jones, an employee of the Pennsylvania Office of Inspector General, says they've been paying people off.
[02:53:17.791 --> 02:53:20.393]  Big Pharma's running this to force it on the children.
[02:53:20.433 --> 02:53:21.975]  Bush says it's going to go nationwide.
[02:53:22.275 --> 02:53:24.076]  Tell us about your discussions with Alan Jones.
[02:53:25.317 --> 02:53:26.578]  Alan Jones is great.
[02:53:26.618 --> 02:53:29.261]  He was working for the Office of Inspector General.
[02:53:29.281 --> 02:53:30.502]  He became aware that
[02:53:34.012 --> 02:53:43.800]  This Texas Medical Algorithm Project that we've been talking about, which is basically a formula for, if this diagnosis, then that drug.
[02:53:44.641 --> 02:53:53.549]  So, if Schizophrenia, then Zyprexa, which is the Eli Lilly drug that's been over $4 billion in sales just from that one drug alone in 2003.
[02:53:54.089 --> 02:53:57.132]  Eli Lilly, as we've already talked about, is strongly connected to
[02:53:57.987 --> 02:54:02.969]  Bush Sr., Bush Jr., and several of Bush's political appointees, and on down the line.
[02:54:02.989 --> 02:54:04.870]  Four million, one drug for schizophrenia?
[02:54:04.930 --> 02:54:09.992]  I mean, even if schizophrenia is a real disease, which it obviously isn't, how many, I mean, are there this many schizophrenics?
[02:54:10.872 --> 02:54:16.814]  Triprex is one of the all-time money-making drugs in history, you know, and it's an Eli Lilly product.
[02:54:17.335 --> 02:54:23.717]  Another Eli Lilly product is called Stratera, which is the number one growing drug to put children on as an alternative to Ritalin.
[02:54:24.224 --> 02:54:32.866]  Eli Lilly, and that's a drug that failed the clinical trials of the antidepressant, so they came back and marketed it as a stimulant for children for ADHD.
[02:54:33.946 --> 02:54:38.107]  Eli Lilly is just making massive profits off this thing, and they're massive players.
[02:54:38.127 --> 02:54:42.668]  And then when your child gets screwed up, they'll put them on two or three other drugs and say, see, your child was bad.
[02:54:43.149 --> 02:54:46.609]  So then they pay these consultants and these doctors to be on their panels.
[02:54:47.090 --> 02:54:52.971]  Many of these people were then appointed to the federal panel by Bush, that then adopt
[02:54:53.484 --> 02:55:02.812]  This algorithm project, and this is going to be linked to this Freedom Initiative, and basically it's sort of guaranteed sales for their top money-making drugs.
[02:55:03.192 --> 02:55:12.520]  You know, Dr. Breeding, you go to these meetings, you go to legislatures, you talk to these sickos that sell out children and people for this.
[02:55:12.540 --> 02:55:15.182]  I mean, when you talk to them, you ask them how they sleep at night.
[02:55:16.343 --> 02:55:20.566]  Well, I had that conversation, that comment once or twice.
[02:55:20.606 --> 02:55:22.088]  You know, it doesn't go very far, you know.
[02:55:23.187 --> 02:55:25.010]  I don't know.
[02:55:39.699 --> 02:55:41.720]  I'm calling the other people terrorists, you know.
[02:55:42.120 --> 02:55:47.023]  They just have an inability to look at themselves, really, in a conscious way.
[02:55:47.443 --> 02:55:50.845]  And so we don't have these conversations very often.
[02:55:50.865 --> 02:55:52.145]  Usually it's indirect.
[02:55:52.405 --> 02:56:01.390]  You know, I'll get up and I'll be speaking to the committee or the panel or the legislature and I'll make these comments directly to them that, you know, what you've just been told is a lie.
[02:56:01.610 --> 02:56:02.651]  This is a fraud.
[02:56:02.971 --> 02:56:04.832]  You know, children are a product market.
[02:56:05.192 --> 02:56:07.053]  This is a criminal shame and disgrace.
[02:56:07.495 --> 02:56:13.698]  But it's said to the politicians, you know, and they hear it in the audience, and I don't know what they do with it.
[02:56:14.378 --> 02:56:15.618]  All right, Dr. Breeden, God bless you.
[02:56:15.638 --> 02:56:16.919]  Thanks for coming on the broadcast.
[02:56:16.959 --> 02:56:17.859]  Hope folks get your books.
[02:56:18.399 --> 02:56:21.021]  I'd love to get you back up in the near future, okay?
[02:56:21.101 --> 02:56:21.681]  That'd be great.
[02:56:21.701 --> 02:56:23.081]  All right, take care, my friend.
[02:56:23.562 --> 02:56:27.503]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central, on the shortwave at 3210, or on your local AM or FM.
[02:56:27.523 --> 02:56:29.704]  And back tomorrow, 11 to 2, Central, during the day.
[02:56:29.744 --> 02:56:31.485]  More great guests, more calls, more info.
[02:56:31.805 --> 02:56:33.246]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:33.266 --> 02:56:34.046]  You don't have a choice.
