[00:00:05.781 --> 00:00:06.421]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.082 --> 00:00:08.162]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.863 --> 00:00:09.943]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:11.444]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:13.045]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.948 --> 00:00:22.011]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.197 --> 00:00:39.498]  Hello ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.461]  Already the seventh day of December 2004.
[00:00:45.062 --> 00:00:51.066]  And the end of 04 is just in sight.
[00:00:51.086 --> 00:00:53.688]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:55.669]  We have a guest coming on from Illinois.
[00:00:55.689 --> 00:01:03.895]  An 87-year-old veteran who was brutally attacked in his home
[00:01:06.784 --> 00:01:18.473]  And when he finally shot the intruder in the foot after warning him to stop beating him, the police came and confiscated his rifles.
[00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:25.239]  And the person he shot in the foot told him, I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna come back and get you.
[00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:30.203]  Imagine telling the cops, hey give me your guns and you go out and do your job without your guns.
[00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:36.745]  Or if you run up to a police officer and take their firearm away, that's a very serious felony.
[00:01:37.246 --> 00:01:38.866]  Because you've just disarmed them.
[00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:41.748]  You've taken away their defensive implement.
[00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.192]  But as usual, it's a World War II vet.
[00:01:51.933 --> 00:01:52.954]  Highly decorated.
[00:01:53.434 --> 00:01:54.615]  He beat the guy up.
[00:01:55.155 --> 00:01:57.836]  The young 20-year-old punk started attacking the 87-year-old man.
[00:02:00.536 --> 00:02:04.297]  And, uh, he fought back and drove the guy outside.
[00:02:04.337 --> 00:02:05.457]  The guy came back in.
[00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:08.678]  So he got his rifle and shot him in the foot.
[00:02:08.778 --> 00:02:09.539]  I wouldn't have done that.
[00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:10.979]  Let me tell you something.
[00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.860]  You come in my house, and you start attacking me, you are dead.
[00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.620]  And I'm not just going to pull the trigger once.
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.681]  I'm going to unload on you.
[00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:19.962]  You can be absolutely assured of that.
[00:02:19.982 --> 00:02:23.483]  I'll kill you if you come in my house in ten seconds.
[00:02:23.523 --> 00:02:24.243]  You'll be dead.
[00:02:24.283 --> 00:02:27.624]  As soon as I see you, as soon as I find out you're an intruder, and as soon as...
[00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:30.364]  You know, as long as it takes me to get to my firearm.
[00:02:30.644 --> 00:02:33.225]  Because I care about my family a lot more than I care about you.
[00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:40.367]  Of course, Illinois has the highest crime rate in the country now.
[00:02:40.887 --> 00:02:44.187]  Because a bunch of their cities have banned guns entirely or make you have permits.
[00:02:45.168 --> 00:02:47.068]  Chicago has the highest for any city.
[00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:51.189]  Since they've confiscated tens of thousands of guns since the mid-90s.
[00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:59.130]  Their crime rate has only increased, making them the crime capital, not just of America, but the world!
[00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.711]  More dangerous than Brazil?
[00:03:01.731 --> 00:03:07.892]  The capital, Brasilia, or any of its other crime-infested boroughs?
[00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:13.193]  More dangerous than some of the biggest cities in South Africa?
[00:03:13.513 --> 00:03:14.454]  I've seen the statistics.
[00:03:16.994 --> 00:03:19.555]  And every week I see articles where they rate some 79, 87,
[00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:33.884]  Your old man, literally, they've got lists of who owns guns, who bought guns 20 years ago, when you didn't have to have a permit, and they come out of the house and they take the guns and they arrest these old men.
[00:03:34.744 --> 00:03:43.708]  They even arrest old women, whose husbands die, and then the old man doesn't, can't renew his license that year, and they send a SWAT team out to Granny's house.
[00:03:45.028 --> 00:03:46.969]  That's how pathetic this country is.
[00:03:48.817 --> 00:03:50.939]  I love America, but I'm here to tell you it's pathetic.
[00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.480]  I want to change the problems.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.140]  I want to fix it.
[00:03:53.401 --> 00:03:54.942]  We've got to admit the problems first.
[00:03:56.123 --> 00:03:57.704]  Illinois, what a cesspool.
[00:04:00.446 --> 00:04:03.148]  I know we have an affiliate or two up in Illinois.
[00:04:03.188 --> 00:04:05.410]  I know we have a lot of listeners in Illinois, and they'll agree with me.
[00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:07.551]  I mean, the government's a cesspool.
[00:04:07.972 --> 00:04:10.634]  Run by the mafia, for the mafia, by the mafia.
[00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:14.256]  You think the mob wants you to own guns?
[00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:14.877]  Of course not!
[00:04:17.344 --> 00:04:19.786]  Gotta have the slaves disarmed so we can feed on them!
[00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:29.352]  Why, we didn't let them have... have swords 2,000 years ago when they were our slaves.
[00:04:29.973 --> 00:04:35.656]  The Italian mob models everything off of, uh... Models everything off of Rome.
[00:04:36.377 --> 00:04:41.861]  Not really the Italian mob that runs Illinois anymore, but they did, and they set kind of the frame up for it.
[00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:43.722]  The parameters.
[00:04:44.523 --> 00:04:47.588]  Alright, that's just one of about 50 vital news stories.
[00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.433]  And yeah, I got a sore throat today, so bear with me.
[00:04:51.735 --> 00:04:53.237]  And we'll be going to your calls as well.
[00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.406]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, and InfoWars.net.
[00:05:03.613 --> 00:05:09.075]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:13.757]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:05:13.977 --> 00:05:20.980]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:27.485]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:28.886]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.206 --> 00:05:32.148]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:34.330]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:41.876]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.176 --> 00:05:45.579]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.063]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:49.083 --> 00:05:49.123]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.143 --> 00:05:49.223]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.483 --> 00:05:50.324]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.384 --> 00:05:50.644]  Call today.
[00:06:01.096 --> 00:06:04.357]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.418 --> 00:06:08.599]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:11.641]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.821 --> 00:06:14.222]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.422 --> 00:06:23.065]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.246 --> 00:06:24.606]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:06:24.806 --> 00:06:28.968]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:29.308 --> 00:06:30.069]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.588 --> 00:07:04.930]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.551]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:14.052]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:14.092 --> 00:07:15.433]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.213 --> 00:07:17.194]  Panama.
[00:07:17.234 --> 00:07:21.458]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.518 --> 00:07:28.464]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:30.646]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.947 --> 00:07:41.276]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.576 --> 00:07:46.942]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.442 --> 00:07:50.966]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.986 --> 00:07:51.366]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:52.507]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:08:02.466 --> 00:08:08.489]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.089 --> 00:08:12.131]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.552 --> 00:08:16.833]  I said it, and I'll say it again.
[00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:24.557]  This country, on average, is degenerate, wicked, and evil.
[00:08:26.898 --> 00:08:30.500]  You know, America was loved because it was a land of freedom.
[00:08:33.502 --> 00:08:36.966]  The United States was loved because it didn't go around invading everybody.
[00:08:37.006 --> 00:08:38.127]  It wasn't an empire.
[00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:43.332]  And because you could own a firearm to defend your family.
[00:08:45.654 --> 00:08:47.516]  And you could save money.
[00:08:47.837 --> 00:08:53.222]  And you could go out and put in a hard day's work and reap the rewards of it.
[00:08:57.395 --> 00:09:00.157]  But we're living on past deeds.
[00:09:00.658 --> 00:09:02.099]  We're running on fumes.
[00:09:02.339 --> 00:09:05.742]  We've had 50 plus million abortions in this country.
[00:09:06.242 --> 00:09:07.283]  Nothing to be proud of.
[00:09:09.064 --> 00:09:12.007]  We have one of the highest crime rates in the world.
[00:09:13.087 --> 00:09:14.148]  Nothing to be proud of.
[00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.493]  We have the most corrupt government in modern history.
[00:09:19.953 --> 00:09:21.214]  Nothing to be proud of.
[00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:47.616]  We live in a country where in New York and in Chicago and other cities, Boston, Mass., old people, single mothers, live behind barricaded doors and are fed on brutally by gangs of scum that the police won't or can't do anything about.
[00:09:51.624 --> 00:10:00.326]  And I could go on listing all this all day, but if we're going to save this country, again, we've got to admit what America is supposed to be about.
[00:10:00.366 --> 00:10:02.067]  The people being on top of the government.
[00:10:02.087 --> 00:10:03.387]  The people being the sovereigns.
[00:10:03.687 --> 00:10:07.609]  The people, the population, being the bosses.
[00:10:08.349 --> 00:10:13.670]  Not the institutionalized minions of the nanny state.
[00:10:14.931 --> 00:10:16.811]  What America was, is dying.
[00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:17.691]  Let me rephrase it.
[00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:19.652]  America is very ill.
[00:10:20.598 --> 00:10:24.779]  A cancer has spread through it, and that cancer is disgusting.
[00:10:30.861 --> 00:10:38.223]  Space-age PR firms are scrambling our psyches, garbage in, garbage out.
[00:10:40.003 --> 00:10:47.505]  And I get angry when I see an article like this one out of the Macomb Journal, and this gentleman's joining us later,
[00:10:49.435 --> 00:11:08.967]  Leonard Gamage is a veteran, 87 years old, no criminal record, and a thug busted into his house.
[00:11:10.928 --> 00:11:18.713]  The 87-year-old man who'd been in the hospital the day before from a nosebleed where he lost over a pint of blood
[00:11:21.189 --> 00:11:46.732]  fought back and drove the young punk out of his house the young punk came back in and Leonard grabbed his rifle and said I'm gonna shoot you and the guy said I'm gonna get you and so Leonard shot him in the foot again I would have put the entire magazine into the person's chest the entire magazine I would have continued firing as they were dropping
[00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:51.242]  Because that's what the law enforcement handbooks will tell you to do.
[00:11:51.302 --> 00:11:58.823]  That person may be on PCP or cocaine, may pull a gun, may come at you, may get a burst of energy the first time you shoot him.
[00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:00.343]  You've got to unload on him.
[00:12:05.824 --> 00:12:13.646]  This guy shoots him in the foot and now the individual has said he's going to come back and he's going to get Leonard.
[00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:24.013]  The problem here is the cops took the old man's rifles, his two rifles, and said, buddy, you don't have a permit on these.
[00:12:29.376 --> 00:12:34.599]  The old fella, you know, these really old men, they just are so sweet.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.662]  Either an old man gets really mean or they get really sweet.
[00:12:39.822 --> 00:12:42.604]  And talking to him, it's just so sad.
[00:12:43.505 --> 00:12:46.146]  Imagine these cops coming and taking an old man's guns.
[00:12:46.526 --> 00:12:50.147]  So he can sit there in his house at night the next time scum comes by his place.
[00:12:50.467 --> 00:12:51.788]  So maybe they can kill him this time.
[00:12:52.028 --> 00:13:08.113]  And by the way, police, for executing an unlawful, criminal, unconstitutional, treasonous, traitorous, seditionous, piece of garbage log, it's that old man, if he ever gets hurt, or anybody's guns you've taken ever gets hurt, you are accomplices to that murder.
[00:13:08.433 --> 00:13:09.533]  You are murderers.
[00:13:11.094 --> 00:13:12.134]  You are murderers.
[00:13:13.962 --> 00:13:22.909]  How would you like it, when you're 87 years old, in a state ridden with crime because of your gun control, not being able to have a gun to protect yourself?
[00:13:30.114 --> 00:13:31.115]  This is pathetic!
[00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:35.758]  I don't want to rant and rave about this all day.
[00:13:35.778 --> 00:13:40.622]  Again, if I'm in a particularly bad mood today, I woke up with a fever about 3 in the morning.
[00:13:41.488 --> 00:13:44.169]  You know those sore throats you can't hardly open your mouth and it hurts so bad?
[00:13:44.709 --> 00:13:52.591]  I went down to the kitchen and put about a half a container of salt in a glass of hot water and I used chemical weapons on the bacteria.
[00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:53.751]  That's what it is, basically.
[00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:56.972]  That's why I'm here moving forward.
[00:13:57.232 --> 00:13:57.552]  Who knows?
[00:13:57.592 --> 00:13:58.532]  I may not be here tomorrow.
[00:13:58.592 --> 00:13:58.952]  I don't know.
[00:13:59.212 --> 00:14:02.013]  Doing three hours with a sore throat and a fever may make it worse.
[00:14:03.933 --> 00:14:06.374]  But I am here because all this news needs to be covered.
[00:14:06.414 --> 00:14:08.655]  I'm not whining and saying, oh, I'm so good, look at me.
[00:14:08.675 --> 00:14:10.115]  I just want you to know why I may sound like
[00:14:12.409 --> 00:14:18.455]  Across between James Earl Jones and Winnie the Pooh is my voice is just shot.
[00:14:21.938 --> 00:14:23.459]  But, uh, he's coming up.
[00:14:26.422 --> 00:14:33.889]  Now, um, here's an article, Colorado Gazette, GPS lets laws long-arm grow.
[00:14:34.713 --> 00:14:37.235]  Very lavish article about how great it is to track you.
[00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:41.978]  Japan plans to post 15,000 soldiers along coast to counter North Koreans.
[00:14:42.158 --> 00:14:42.538]  Report.
[00:14:44.259 --> 00:14:45.720]  We told you about this last week.
[00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:47.522]  Now it's in the Boston Globe.
[00:14:47.882 --> 00:14:50.023]  Returning Fallujans will face clampdown.
[00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:53.205]  National ID cards, face scans, thumb scans.
[00:14:53.245 --> 00:14:55.227]  They'll be killed if they don't have their card in order.
[00:14:58.549 --> 00:15:00.030]  Really serious article here.
[00:15:01.247 --> 00:15:04.790]  OPEC Nations seen cutting worldwide deposits in dollars.
[00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:10.554]  We've known this has been happening the last year, but now, now it's in the New York Times.
[00:15:12.216 --> 00:15:17.880]  They've already dumped 15% of their dollars, and the slides already begun.
[00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:24.505]  We're on the edge of a depression as Ron Paul, Ron Paul, the congressman, the doctor, says this.
[00:15:24.726 --> 00:15:25.406]  I hope he's wrong.
[00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:26.247]  He said it a year ago.
[00:15:27.924 --> 00:15:37.370]  The sad part is while we're in this depression that's coming up, if it does happen, the globalists will have their spinmeisters out and the people will be thanking their abusers.
[00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:38.391]  Oh, thank you.
[00:15:39.612 --> 00:15:49.038]  Bring in your new economic reforms, more taxation and regulation during the depression to fight back against the things that cause this.
[00:15:50.338 --> 00:15:51.199]  So we'll cover that.
[00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:57.343]  Also, ex-Dazi spy chief, Marcus Wolf, hired by Homeland Security.
[00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:02.163]  And we got some new info on this.
[00:16:02.183 --> 00:16:03.444]  We'll be covering that.
[00:16:03.464 --> 00:16:09.607]  I mean, it's not enough to have former KGB chiefs that we have confirmed consult for Homeland Security.
[00:16:10.008 --> 00:16:13.229]  Now we need the Stasi chief, known as the Silver Fox.
[00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:21.354]  And I got another article here about the FSB and the FBI training together.
[00:16:21.714 --> 00:16:23.655]  The FSB helping train our FBI.
[00:16:24.496 --> 00:16:28.398]  Of course, the Toronto Sun, where the torture our government carries out.
[00:16:29.494 --> 00:16:31.395]  He's almost identical to Soviet torture.
[00:16:31.755 --> 00:16:33.575]  The trending's coming along quite nicely.
[00:16:34.616 --> 00:16:38.977]  Also, activists say blind parents are being treated unfairly.
[00:16:38.997 --> 00:16:49.801]  Believe it or not, folks, people who are blind, who are trained in it, can be just as good of parents as anybody else, but they get a lot of their kids taken by CPS.
[00:16:50.961 --> 00:16:52.542]  They're trying to do that out in California.
[00:16:52.562 --> 00:16:53.722]  I've got some articles on that.
[00:16:55.208 --> 00:16:57.950]  Two federal machinations happening.
[00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:01.892]  Interstate booze ban, Supreme Court, but it'll affect more than just that.
[00:17:04.754 --> 00:17:15.921]  Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum is a blasphemous thing where George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld and other White House officials are angels and wise men around the manger.
[00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.723]  There's no end to the humiliation.
[00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:23.566]  Also, Bill Clinton helps launch Chinese search engine.
[00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:26.505]  Communist Chinese-owned search engine.
[00:17:26.545 --> 00:17:27.546]  He's very proud of it.
[00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:36.348]  Also, Massachusetts launches computerized medical files.
[00:17:38.869 --> 00:17:41.029]  And the problem is it also indexes in.
[00:17:41.049 --> 00:17:42.990]  They make you thumb scan to get a gun now.
[00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:44.350]  It's just getting worse and worse.
[00:17:48.511 --> 00:17:52.832]  Two new CIA reports offer warnings on Iraq's past that there's almost no way to win it.
[00:17:54.935 --> 00:17:56.376]  Well, that's a conventional win.
[00:17:56.996 --> 00:18:05.861]  The globalists kill a bunch of our boys and make a bunch of money on weapon sales and draw this thing out for 5-10 years and keep the oil from flowing so they can jack up prices.
[00:18:07.042 --> 00:18:10.804]  That's quite a win.
[00:18:12.385 --> 00:18:13.386]  Actually, that is a win.
[00:18:13.426 --> 00:18:14.927]  Vietnam was a win for the globalists.
[00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:15.987]  The drug war is a win.
[00:18:16.327 --> 00:18:19.149]  Triple the heroin, double the cocaine than we had 10 years ago.
[00:18:19.169 --> 00:18:21.751]  7 million people behind bars instead of 1.3 million.
[00:18:23.484 --> 00:18:29.687]  Two years ago, I mean, it's a... The people that deal the drugs, the same companies we've tracked back, also own the big private prisons.
[00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:30.487]  They deal the drugs.
[00:18:30.507 --> 00:18:31.588]  Your dumb kid uses it.
[00:18:32.368 --> 00:18:33.769]  Breaks in the house wanting drugs.
[00:18:34.729 --> 00:18:37.190]  And they end up in your little prison owned by the drug dealers.
[00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:38.290]  It's a wonderful system.
[00:18:38.771 --> 00:18:41.392]  Seriously, the drug dealing families, the mafia families own the prisons.
[00:18:42.252 --> 00:18:45.254]  Activists dominate content complaints.
[00:18:45.274 --> 00:18:47.575]  We've all heard about how there's all these new complaints to the FCC.
[00:18:47.955 --> 00:18:48.915]  Turns out 99.8% of them were filed
[00:18:54.163 --> 00:18:57.085]  by the Parents Television Council.
[00:18:58.025 --> 00:18:59.806]  And again, I don't have a problem with them doing that.
[00:18:59.846 --> 00:19:05.789]  I have a problem with the stuff that's on TV, but they use the complaints and then go after other free speech and not all the profanity.
[00:19:05.809 --> 00:19:08.530]  They always have to look at what's behind it, folks.
[00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.652]  Look at things on a three-dimensional plane, not a two-dimensional.
[00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:13.292]  Look at this.
[00:19:15.814 --> 00:19:16.794]  So that's just some of the news.
[00:19:17.214 --> 00:19:22.397]  Also, Dollar hits new low against Europe despite Eurozone call for action.
[00:19:25.058 --> 00:19:27.540]  It's about to hit $1.35.
[00:19:29.101 --> 00:19:30.441]  The euro is the dollar.
[00:19:31.042 --> 00:19:34.784]  Just two years ago, the euro was 89 cents to the dollar.
[00:19:37.786 --> 00:19:40.748]  Turns out the Total Information Awareness Network was running before 9-11.
[00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:42.149]  Well, of course it was.
[00:19:42.929 --> 00:19:44.410]  Of course all of it was.
[00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:49.393]  Remember that football player turned army soldier who got killed?
[00:19:50.113 --> 00:19:52.655]  Just like with Jessica Lynch, turns out that story isn't true.
[00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:54.792]  Our own government killed him.
[00:19:56.975 --> 00:19:57.676]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.553 --> 00:20:02.533]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.613 --> 00:20:07.395]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.555 --> 00:20:15.358]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.618 --> 00:20:21.000]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:28.182]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.482 --> 00:20:33.825]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:34.085 --> 00:20:38.808]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:39.148 --> 00:20:46.732]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:47.092 --> 00:20:53.341]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.662 --> 00:20:54.703]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.723 --> 00:20:54.924]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.658 --> 00:21:06.280]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.641]  Hi, Alan, welcome to the program.
[00:21:07.801 --> 00:21:08.381]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:11.923]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:12.623]  Is that true?
[00:21:12.843 --> 00:21:13.823]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:21:13.844 --> 00:21:16.845]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:21:16.905 --> 00:21:17.185]  price.
[00:21:17.365 --> 00:21:19.466]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:21:19.506 --> 00:21:20.226]  They're very common.
[00:21:20.306 --> 00:21:23.508]  Those common drugs, you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:21:23.528 --> 00:21:23.768]  price.
[00:21:24.048 --> 00:21:25.209]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[00:21:25.269 --> 00:21:27.652]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:21:27.852 --> 00:21:31.656]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:21:31.696 --> 00:21:31.976]  price.
[00:21:32.337 --> 00:21:34.739]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.022]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:21:37.042 --> 00:21:39.064]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[00:21:39.324 --> 00:21:44.269]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll free number for your information package.
[00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:46.492]  To find out more, call toll free 1-800-840-0686.
[00:21:46.512 --> 00:21:46.912]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:48.174]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[00:22:01.562 --> 00:22:04.546]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:13.736]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:22:14.056 --> 00:22:18.742]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:22:19.202 --> 00:22:25.905]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:22:26.305 --> 00:22:38.111]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:22:38.571 --> 00:22:39.632]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:23:04.875 --> 00:23:08.356]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:23:08.956 --> 00:23:12.498]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:15.759]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:23:16.159 --> 00:23:18.600]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.520]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:23:21.241 --> 00:23:22.961]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:23:23.501 --> 00:23:24.462]  Check with your doctor.
[00:23:24.562 --> 00:23:29.483]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:23:29.944 --> 00:23:30.844]  In all likelihood,
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:34.663]  Your doctor will recommend Bright Light Therapy with one of our special lights.
[00:23:35.303 --> 00:23:36.144]  Light up your life.
[00:23:36.244 --> 00:23:38.966]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with a Northern Light.
[00:23:39.507 --> 00:23:49.755]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com.
[00:23:50.275 --> 00:23:52.417]  That's northernlighttechnologies.com.
[00:23:52.977 --> 00:23:54.198]  Our phone number again is 800-263-0066.
[00:24:08.679 --> 00:24:14.923]  I know we got loaded phone lines, and Albert, and Charles, and Tim, and Scott, and Dan, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:27.530]  I need to continue with the news, though, right now, that later the 87-year-old war veteran fistfights with the intruder, pushes him outside,
[00:24:28.965 --> 00:24:33.087]  And the guy attacks him again, and he warns him, I'm gonna shoot you, and goes ahead and shoots the guy in the foot.
[00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:36.868]  The cops come and take the old man's gun, so he can't defend himself.
[00:24:38.109 --> 00:24:41.110]  Despite the fact that the intruder told him, I'm gonna come back and get you.
[00:24:42.371 --> 00:24:43.211]  That's in the newspaper.
[00:24:44.191 --> 00:24:44.992]  So what do the cops do?
[00:24:45.032 --> 00:24:48.053]  Well, let's just take your gun, you old veteran.
[00:24:49.553 --> 00:24:52.635]  You can have that to defend the country, but you can't have it to defend yourself.
[00:24:53.635 --> 00:24:54.415]  Poor old man.
[00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:57.817]  Quite a guy, too, I tell ya.
[00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:08.532]  But I guess folks from that generation come off a different chip, a different block than a lot of us do.
[00:25:08.552 --> 00:25:14.714]  I tell you, the baby boomers are quite a sight, aren't they?
[00:25:14.734 --> 00:25:17.314]  Bunch of spoiled little piglets.
[00:25:18.955 --> 00:25:22.195]  Total Information Awareness ready before 9-11.
[00:25:24.496 --> 00:25:25.196]  Of course it was.
[00:25:25.256 --> 00:25:27.917]  We already knew this, but Citizens for Legitimate Government reporting,
[00:25:29.457 --> 00:25:36.478]  Can report today an exclusive story about the Total Information Awareness Network initiated by Admiral John Poindexter.
[00:25:39.479 --> 00:25:46.640]  The exclusive story tells us that a day after 9-11, Poindexter's office of TIA program was already established at the Pentagon.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.381]  Says inside, unnamed source, well it's called the NSA, folks.
[00:25:52.821 --> 00:25:56.342]  Poindexter had the TIA program already ready to roll out on 9-12-0-1.
[00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:07.504]  If that means the program was already to roll out previous 9-11, the source familiar with the program and privy to top-secret government contractors said, of course.
[00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:17.190]  The Total Information Awareness Program that was held by Poindexter was disassembled after Congress had decided against it.
[00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:17.851]  That's not true.
[00:26:18.311 --> 00:26:22.233]  Rightly asserting that it constituted an invasion of citizens' privacy.
[00:26:25.095 --> 00:26:26.296]  Okay, that's not true.
[00:26:27.432 --> 00:26:36.755]  The NSA at Fort Meade, the National Security Agency, has been spying on the American people since it was set up.
[00:26:40.177 --> 00:26:43.558]  And the CIA has been spying on signals since it was set up in 1947.
[00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:51.301]  And the OSS has been spying on a wide range of signals since it was set up in 1940.
[00:26:55.732 --> 00:27:15.079]  And the Total Information Awareness Network was just one name of a particular program to take all the private databases and integrate them through a national ID card index system and to read your emails and to do these detailed algorithms of your purchase records and your activities.
[00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:18.340]  So it was just NSA going public.
[00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:19.641]  It was like a brand name.
[00:27:20.618 --> 00:27:22.820]  It's like when Ford puts out the new Mustang.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:25.521]  You know, the Mustang was made at a Ford plant.
[00:27:26.382 --> 00:27:27.843]  The Mustang isn't Ford.
[00:27:28.223 --> 00:27:34.147]  So because they go, OK, we're recalling the Mustang, they give it a new paint job, call it a new name, and roll it back out.
[00:27:34.447 --> 00:27:35.208]  It's the same thing.
[00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:41.992]  And yes, we knew Poindexter was creeping around the Pentagon and the NSA before 9-11.
[00:27:42.012 --> 00:27:43.593]  We knew they were already setting all this up.
[00:27:43.613 --> 00:27:44.354]  We had the reports.
[00:27:49.235 --> 00:27:51.157]  Listen to this out of the London Independent.
[00:27:51.397 --> 00:27:56.103]  Opposition wants to be smeared with terror attack, says official.
[00:27:56.143 --> 00:27:57.805]  Now we reported this before the election.
[00:27:58.806 --> 00:28:01.028]  Now there's a new article out yesterday.
[00:28:01.749 --> 00:28:06.254]  Bunch of police quit and said, look, we've been told to carry out bombings and blame it on the opposition.
[00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:20.375]  Ukraine's embattled government is ready to stage fake terror attacks to destabilize the country and discredit the opposition ahead of a return of the presidential vote, a senior government source has told The Independent.
[00:28:21.076 --> 00:28:31.621]  The official who works for the government of the Moscow-backed candidate and current Prime Minister said, one of the plans is to blow up a pipeline and blame it on the opposition supporters.
[00:28:32.121 --> 00:28:36.083]  Ukraine is the key transit country for Russian gas supplies to the West.
[00:28:38.115 --> 00:28:45.417]  Mr. Yakonsovich's backers fear the prospect of the candidate losing to Viktor Yuskovico.
[00:28:46.097 --> 00:28:47.577]  I can't pronounce these names, I'm sorry.
[00:28:48.257 --> 00:28:53.439]  And are ready to plunge the country into economic chaos, the source revealed.
[00:28:54.039 --> 00:28:56.840]  They're planning to use criminals, plain bandits.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.520]  Then they have a holdover.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.760]  That's how they do it, yes.
[00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:06.742]  The source said that a senior member of the government had been tasked with overseeing terrorist acts.
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:13.563]  Well, yeah, Putin got caught by Moscow police planting bombs in the fourth building in 1999.
[00:29:13.663 --> 00:29:15.685]  I mean, they got caught, folks!
[00:29:17.046 --> 00:29:19.667]  I'm just glad our government isn't like this, aren't you?
[00:29:19.747 --> 00:29:23.210]  I'm glad they didn't stage the Dolfa Tonkin, now admitted that they did.
[00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:27.593]  I'm glad they didn't stage the USS Liberty attack between the U.S.
[00:29:27.633 --> 00:29:29.274]  and Israel, to blame it on Egypt.
[00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:33.397]  I'm glad they didn't have Operation North, was the official U.S.
[00:29:33.437 --> 00:29:36.859]  government plan to carry out 9-11, that we do really have, yes.
[00:29:38.539 --> 00:29:40.622]  Just, it's just how they operate, folks.
[00:29:41.603 --> 00:29:43.745]  Hitler blew up the Reichstag to get control.
[00:29:43.765 --> 00:29:44.907]  You starting to figure this out?

[00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:04.119]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[00:30:04.499 --> 00:30:08.423]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[00:30:08.803 --> 00:30:11.445]  Here at home and abroad, our own war against terror continues.

[00:33:12.885 --> 00:33:15.365]  My friends, we're about to go to Leonard Gammage.
[00:33:16.686 --> 00:33:19.406]  This is out of the Maycomb Journal up in Illinois.
[00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:29.209]  Resident captures intruder, Leonard Gammage, is sore today, which is understandable, since he spent more than 45 minutes fighting off an intruder late Friday.
[00:33:31.290 --> 00:33:35.191]  The punk came to his door, he opened the door, he pushed in on him, started assaulting him.
[00:33:35.231 --> 00:33:39.672]  Gammage basically kicked his tail out of the house, he came back in, said, I'm gonna get ya.
[00:33:40.433 --> 00:33:43.155]  Damage got one of his rifles, started beating him with it.
[00:33:43.976 --> 00:33:46.438]  And the guy kept coming, so he warned him and shot him in the foot.
[00:33:46.478 --> 00:33:47.379]  I'd have shot him in the chest.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:53.344]  And I thought the name rang a bell, because I'm someone of a World War II history buff, and I've read his name a few places.
[00:33:53.664 --> 00:33:55.606]  I was just talking to Leonard during the break.
[00:33:56.126 --> 00:34:02.672]  He was actually one of the chief trainers in in-country for 20 months, and pilots of the Flying Tigers, folks!
[00:34:04.061 --> 00:34:15.065]  Leonard Gamage, a World War II hero, and I know it mentions in the article that he's a World War II veteran, and so the cops then dropped by and took his guns.
[00:34:15.285 --> 00:34:21.587]  So, when the young piece of filth gets back out, and he said, I'm going to get you, I guess he can come back.
[00:34:22.568 --> 00:34:24.908]  So this is how pathetic our country's gotten.
[00:34:25.408 --> 00:34:26.549]  We need to change this.
[00:34:27.463 --> 00:34:30.165]  You know, I really do feel good about that.
[00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:32.166]  Like you can send your own cash while you're at it.
[00:34:32.186 --> 00:34:32.807]  That's a good feeling.
[00:34:52.461 --> 00:34:55.283]  And I heard you were in the hospital a few days before this happened.
[00:34:55.363 --> 00:34:58.186]  Yes, I had a bad cold on the last Wednesday.
[00:34:58.206 --> 00:35:02.969]  Blowing my nose, and I developed a very severe nosebleed.
[00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:06.372]  And the doctor said, now you, he impacted it.
[00:35:07.053 --> 00:35:09.695]  You go home, and you just stay in bed.
[00:35:09.815 --> 00:35:10.956]  Don't move around.
[00:35:10.996 --> 00:35:12.197]  Don't touch your nose.
[00:35:13.158 --> 00:35:16.040]  Well, two nights later is when that intruder arrived.
[00:35:17.861 --> 00:35:19.803]  I was weak because I'd lost a lot of blood.
[00:35:22.794 --> 00:35:24.695]  Describe what this scumbag did.
[00:35:25.675 --> 00:35:30.437]  Well, it was very shocking to be sitting here watching television.
[00:35:30.497 --> 00:35:42.021]  I live by Pine Timber, about a half mile off the main highway and about a mile from the city of Macomb, which has a university, Western Illinois University.
[00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:46.162]  And we had a little trouble with people on drugs.
[00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:52.511]  He made a very loud knock on the front door.
[00:35:52.531 --> 00:35:58.592]  And I have no traffic down here, just pine trees and deer and soybeans.
[00:35:59.512 --> 00:36:01.472]  So I went to the other door.
[00:36:01.492 --> 00:36:03.433]  They both opened on the patio.
[00:36:04.553 --> 00:36:07.033]  And I unlocked the door and turned on my porch light.
[00:36:07.054 --> 00:36:12.215]  And he opened the storm door and shoved me back against my kitchen table.
[00:36:13.135 --> 00:36:14.435]  Well, I was in a shock.
[00:36:15.578 --> 00:36:18.500]  But I did manage to push him out back on the patio.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:23.203]  And I had two old family rifles on a gun rack.
[00:36:24.043 --> 00:36:25.705]  I want to stop you right there.
[00:36:25.725 --> 00:36:28.226]  Let me stop you right there, sir.
[00:36:28.566 --> 00:36:30.548]  Two family rifles.
[00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:33.449]  Oh, this is getting worse by the minute.
[00:36:33.730 --> 00:36:35.611]  Two family rifles.
[00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:37.172]  For those that have family rifles,
[00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.692]  Oh, so these were family rivals, please continue.
[00:36:40.752 --> 00:36:45.155]  Well, yes, one was a Stephens I'd had since, well, my dad owned it years ago.
[00:36:45.515 --> 00:36:46.136]  Oh, no.
[00:36:47.597 --> 00:36:54.982]  And I managed to pull the Stephens, it was a magazine or a bolt action.
[00:36:56.243 --> 00:37:04.829]  I pulled it out of the rack by the barrel, and I was lucky to have enough space to swing it and hit the intruder in the back.
[00:37:05.868 --> 00:37:09.890]  Well let me stop you, let me stop you Leonard just for a second.
[00:37:10.591 --> 00:37:11.331]  So people get an idea.
[00:37:11.371 --> 00:37:13.493]  The paper says this went on for 45 minutes.
[00:37:13.533 --> 00:37:15.254]  How long did you, is that accurate?
[00:37:15.274 --> 00:37:16.975]  How long did you fight this guy off?
[00:37:17.955 --> 00:37:23.138]  Well it, it, it, I slept in the kitchen at the time.
[00:37:23.999 --> 00:37:26.700]  And that went on for about 10 minutes.
[00:37:28.782 --> 00:37:31.063]  And he entered the kitchen twice.
[00:37:31.143 --> 00:37:32.624]  We fell down twice.
[00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:49.368]  We had a scuffle, he was trying to get a hold of the gun, and I was lucky, I was lucky in this, cause he was pretty strong, and um, I got him out the door, and I said, now, leave, or I'm gonna kill you.
[00:37:50.929 --> 00:37:59.573]  Well, he just stood on the patio, glaring at me, and I shot on the floor, right next to his right foot.
[00:38:00.726 --> 00:38:03.028]  And I shot again next to his left foot.
[00:38:03.709 --> 00:38:04.950]  And he didn't even flinch.
[00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.171]  And he said, I'm going to get you.
[00:38:08.372 --> 00:38:13.236]  Well, that shook me up, because I knew he was dead serious.
[00:38:14.257 --> 00:38:18.101]  So I took a deep breath and went right to the arch.
[00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:19.221]  And he screamed.
[00:38:19.942 --> 00:38:21.083]  Leonard, let me stop you right there.
[00:38:21.203 --> 00:38:21.483]  Yes.
[00:38:21.583 --> 00:38:22.744]  Before you get to the shooting.
[00:38:23.105 --> 00:38:24.586]  Tell me what the scumbag looked like.
[00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:29.963]  Well, he wasn't a bad looking guy.
[00:38:30.063 --> 00:38:33.965]  He looked like a college student, which I understand he may be.
[00:38:34.626 --> 00:38:35.747]  About 20 years old.
[00:38:36.907 --> 00:38:37.748]  Average age.
[00:38:38.469 --> 00:38:39.449]  Small, not big.
[00:38:39.629 --> 00:38:43.372]  Because the newspaper doesn't give his name or anything, but they give your name.
[00:38:44.093 --> 00:38:46.314]  Tell us what this guy looks like for folks in your town.
[00:38:47.935 --> 00:38:51.838]  He looked just like a college student.
[00:38:53.499 --> 00:38:56.441]  You know, dressed in the usual college grab.
[00:38:57.981 --> 00:39:02.164]  He was shaven, had a pretty long hair.
[00:39:02.284 --> 00:39:03.265]  Was he Anglo?
[00:39:04.265 --> 00:39:05.086]  Yes, he was.
[00:39:05.526 --> 00:39:10.329]  Well now... Was he a young yuppie punk?
[00:39:10.509 --> 00:39:12.451]  Yes, that's about it, I guess.
[00:39:12.651 --> 00:39:13.311]  Just a punk, okay.
[00:39:13.331 --> 00:39:13.491]  Yes.
[00:39:13.671 --> 00:39:16.513]  Alright, I'm sorry for interrupting you.
[00:39:16.553 --> 00:39:20.416]  So he says, I'm gonna get ya after you've shot two shots by his feet.
[00:39:20.436 --> 00:39:21.036]  What do you do next?
[00:39:21.557 --> 00:39:24.999]  Well, he was only about seven on the patio.
[00:39:25.828 --> 00:39:28.070]  He's only, you know, about six feet away.
[00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:29.130]  I didn't have much time.
[00:39:30.011 --> 00:39:31.872]  And I was lucky that I was able to hit his foot.
[00:39:32.433 --> 00:39:39.197]  I shot through the door, and the door has an insert where you put a screen in.
[00:39:39.217 --> 00:39:44.341]  So I shot through the screen insert, and hit him in the arch.
[00:39:45.141 --> 00:39:51.045]  And he screamed and jumped, and about like a chicken with its head off, rotated around on a walk.
[00:39:53.948 --> 00:39:58.889]  He calmed down finally and I made him stand up and hold on to the porch pillow.
[00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:01.910]  I said, I gotta make a phone call.
[00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.191]  If you move, I'll shoot you.
[00:40:06.471 --> 00:40:08.512]  So you understand that?
[00:40:08.532 --> 00:40:09.432]  And he shook his head.
[00:40:09.452 --> 00:40:15.433]  So I got back in the kitchen where I could look every second or two and call my neighbor.
[00:40:16.514 --> 00:40:20.054]  Cause he was close by and um, Tom Friday.
[00:40:21.675 --> 00:40:22.115]  So uh,
[00:40:22.887 --> 00:40:28.771]  When I looked back out, I just told my neighbor, help me, Leonard, and I'm up.
[00:40:29.812 --> 00:40:31.353]  Well, I looked back out, he was gone.
[00:40:32.914 --> 00:40:37.237]  And the only light was the, um, cutterwalk bomb on the back door.
[00:40:37.257 --> 00:40:44.261]  And it was, and this close to the, uh, town, there's a slight overcast in the lights, reflection.
[00:40:45.762 --> 00:40:48.604]  It's pretty dark, but still, it's a little bit of light.
[00:40:48.624 --> 00:40:52.046]  Now, I understand the lights bounce off of the clouds back down.
[00:40:52.067 --> 00:40:52.227]  Yeah.
[00:40:53.869 --> 00:41:01.410]  So, uh, I thought, God, I hate to go out there in the car, because he may be watching me, and the commitment with an axer.
[00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:06.151]  Coach Grudge has pitchforks, axes, you know, everything.
[00:41:06.951 --> 00:41:18.173]  So, uh, I went out straight south of the house, and he couldn't see me come out that door, and then went down into a little valley, into the pine timber.
[00:41:20.053 --> 00:41:22.894]  And then I went to the pine timber,
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:33.703]  Keepin' my eyes up towards the barn and made a circle route to the adjoining soybean field up behind the barn.
[00:41:33.723 --> 00:41:36.444]  And the garage is between the barn and the house.
[00:41:37.744 --> 00:41:47.127]  Well, then I saw him move around the west side of the barn, of the garage, while I was standing on the side of the barn.
[00:41:47.147 --> 00:41:52.249]  And he was looking at the house, so I knew he thought I was still in the house.
[00:41:53.777 --> 00:42:02.304]  So I went quietly towards the garage to get my gun ready to fire.
[00:42:03.445 --> 00:42:07.929]  When I got to about 30 feet of him, he was still looking at the house.
[00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:11.512]  And I said, do not turn around.
[00:42:11.533 --> 00:42:13.554]  If you move, I'll kill you.
[00:42:14.815 --> 00:42:16.757]  Well, he didn't move.
[00:42:18.018 --> 00:42:18.779]  I got up to him.
[00:42:20.535 --> 00:42:27.698]  And I probably said a couple of curse words, and, uh, like, you know, well, I didn't feel inclined to just shoot him in the chest.
[00:42:29.279 --> 00:42:37.482]  And then he begged not to be shot, and I thought, damn it, this could be his first experience with drugs, and he may be a nice guy, really.
[00:42:38.723 --> 00:42:47.687]  So, uh, I marched back up to the back of the house and sat on a rock wall, on the back, back near the patio,
[00:42:48.726 --> 00:42:52.748]  I think you said on this walk, do not turn around, but speak.
[00:42:54.288 --> 00:42:56.409]  And, um, I said, you understand?
[00:42:56.469 --> 00:42:57.210]  He shook his head.
[00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.631]  Then Tom Friday drove up.
[00:43:00.911 --> 00:43:07.934]  He got out and he looked like he was in a coma because I had this gun about, you know, about a foot away from the man's head.
[00:43:09.855 --> 00:43:13.296]  And, uh, Tom said, Leonard, what's, what's going on?
[00:43:13.316 --> 00:43:14.016]  What are you doing?
[00:43:14.036 --> 00:43:17.518]  I said, this guy's trying to kill me.
[00:43:18.718 --> 00:43:20.659]  So I'm debating whether or not to kill him.
[00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:24.560]  I'm sitting there, wait, wait, calm down, calm down.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:27.362]  He said, keep your gun on him, I'll call the sheriff.
[00:43:28.282 --> 00:43:29.382]  So he called the sheriff.
[00:43:30.523 --> 00:43:34.304]  And then about six or eight police cars came in with fire trucks.
[00:43:35.805 --> 00:43:41.107]  And the intruder would not tell us anything except his name.
[00:43:41.127 --> 00:43:43.928]  By the way, I want to know his name.
[00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:44.549]  What's his name?
[00:43:44.589 --> 00:43:46.229]  Well, you know, I couldn't understand it.
[00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.750]  It sounded like
[00:43:48.832 --> 00:43:53.197]  Well, James Bandelier or something like that.
[00:43:53.257 --> 00:43:56.881]  Well, why didn't the newspaper put this punk's name in the paper?
[00:43:57.702 --> 00:44:03.889]  Well, then I didn't like him taking my two old family guns.
[00:44:05.166 --> 00:44:06.086]  Let's stop right there.
[00:44:06.126 --> 00:44:07.647]  Let me stop you right there.
[00:44:07.667 --> 00:44:08.007]  Yeah.
[00:44:08.507 --> 00:44:14.348]  Was it the Sheriff's Department, the Police Department, who took your daddy's rifle that he gave you?
[00:44:14.368 --> 00:44:15.929]  Because I want that rifle back.
[00:44:16.589 --> 00:44:19.050]  It was a McDonough County Sheriff.
[00:44:20.550 --> 00:44:24.051]  And his first name is Mike, and I think his last name is Johnson.
[00:44:24.811 --> 00:44:26.431]  Okay, now a Sheriff's Deputy took it?
[00:44:27.032 --> 00:44:28.472]  No, the Sheriff himself.
[00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:31.571]  Okay, so Mike Johnson, sheriff of what county?
[00:44:31.971 --> 00:44:32.951]  McDonald County.
[00:44:33.231 --> 00:44:33.851]  McDonald?
[00:44:34.231 --> 00:44:36.152]  Yeah, and McComas County seat.
[00:44:37.852 --> 00:44:41.313]  Okay, um... He's McDonald County Sheriff.
[00:44:41.813 --> 00:44:43.333]  And this happened how many days ago?
[00:44:43.933 --> 00:44:47.034]  Friday night, about, you know, three nights ago.
[00:44:47.214 --> 00:44:55.116]  Please describe to me, sir, once the police get there and they see you've got this guy at gunpoint, did they tell you to put your gun down, act like you were bad somehow?
[00:44:56.266 --> 00:44:56.786]  Well, yes.
[00:44:57.427 --> 00:44:58.107]  Of course they did.
[00:44:58.127 --> 00:44:59.368]  Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:45:00.589 --> 00:45:04.272]  When the police got there, I still had the gun.
[00:45:04.292 --> 00:45:11.377]  And Tom, my neighbor, said, uh, Leonard, we better give the gun to the police.
[00:45:11.437 --> 00:45:16.221]  So, uh, the sheriff was there, and so Tom handed the gun to the sheriff.
[00:45:17.381 --> 00:45:21.364]  And then the sheriff said, uh, you did a hell of a job, Eric.
[00:45:21.544 --> 00:45:23.546]  And, uh, then I told him what happened.
[00:45:24.289 --> 00:45:25.650]  But he still took your gun!
[00:45:25.710 --> 00:45:26.051]  Yes.
[00:45:26.511 --> 00:45:27.392]  He apologized.
[00:45:27.432 --> 00:45:30.135]  He said, well, I said, well... That doesn't cut it.
[00:45:30.195 --> 00:45:35.880]  Once this guy has a friend that resents me shooting his buddy, then I'm out here without any gun.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.841]  I don't like that.
[00:45:37.301 --> 00:45:37.922]  Say that again.
[00:45:37.942 --> 00:45:49.393]  I told the sheriff, once this intruder has a friend that resents me shooting his friend, then they come back out here, two or three guys,
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.881]  And I don't have any means of defense.
[00:45:51.901 --> 00:45:55.522]  Well, if I live in Illinois, I'd drop by your house and I'd give you a gun right now.
[00:45:56.002 --> 00:46:00.984]  Well, several neighbors have called me and offered... Well, don't say it.
[00:46:01.564 --> 00:46:02.105]  Yeah.
[00:46:02.145 --> 00:46:03.045]  Yeah, just don't say it.
[00:46:03.185 --> 00:46:05.286]  Yeah.
[00:46:05.346 --> 00:46:06.246]  But I understand.
[00:46:06.286 --> 00:46:06.706]  That's good.
[00:46:06.926 --> 00:46:07.327]  Yeah.
[00:46:08.127 --> 00:46:11.088]  But... But the chef, he apologized.
[00:46:11.128 --> 00:46:13.389]  He wasn't... He's a nice guy.
[00:46:13.409 --> 00:46:18.831]  He said, Leonard, I hate to do this, but the law requires me to pick up any weapon.
[00:46:19.912 --> 00:46:22.593]  When there's an ordeal, it goes on like this.
[00:46:22.953 --> 00:46:25.234]  But the newspaper says it's because you didn't have a permit.
[00:46:25.254 --> 00:46:28.336]  That's true, I never did have a permit.
[00:46:28.356 --> 00:46:29.496]  You don't need a permit!
[00:46:29.516 --> 00:46:34.779]  I mean, we have the Second Amendment that trumps... I mean, even in your little town, you gotta have permits.
[00:46:34.819 --> 00:46:35.759]  I guess it's statewide.
[00:46:36.579 --> 00:46:42.882]  Well, he said, you go out to the front gang Monday and apply for a permit, which I did.
[00:46:42.922 --> 00:46:46.244]  But you know, I can rely on every question.
[00:46:46.284 --> 00:46:48.045]  They just said, have you ever been in trouble before?
[00:46:48.085 --> 00:46:48.585]  I said, no.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.941]  A lot of little silly questions.
[00:46:51.861 --> 00:46:54.643]  I saved five bucks and I got to send that in to Springfield.
[00:46:54.923 --> 00:46:56.163]  Have you gotten your guns back yet?
[00:46:56.584 --> 00:46:59.245]  Yeah, no, Sheriff still has my guns.
[00:47:00.005 --> 00:47:01.586]  Yeah, they got a tendency to not give them back.
[00:47:01.606 --> 00:47:03.407]  They better give you your daddy's gun back.
[00:47:03.727 --> 00:47:08.110]  Well, see, that's nostalgic reasons I want to send them back.
[00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.010]  Believe me, I know.
[00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:11.931]  I've got guns that were great-great-granddaddy's.
[00:47:12.472 --> 00:47:13.952]  Well, you know the feeling.
[00:47:14.473 --> 00:47:16.674]  In a way, I think that wouldn't have saved my life.
[00:47:18.613 --> 00:47:38.591]  Well, let me ask you this question, because if somebody comes in my house, when he busted in, I would have, because they tell you, he could have gotten the gun away from you, your second shot could have misfired, let me stop you, the police, obviously sir, you're a combat veteran, trained the Flying Tigers, you were an officer in the Flying Tigers, I'm not going to tell you about
[00:47:39.091 --> 00:47:39.651]  That's true.
[00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:42.373]  Well, I... I never said he heard that he got my attorney already.
[00:47:42.393 --> 00:47:42.833]  The intruder.
[00:47:42.853 --> 00:47:45.735]  Well, there's not a hell of a note that I may end up being sued.
[00:47:45.755 --> 00:47:45.955]  I don't...
[00:48:08.149 --> 00:48:10.550]  The people, I think, wouldn't object very much.
[00:48:12.151 --> 00:48:13.091]  But what else could I do?
[00:48:13.172 --> 00:48:16.033]  I just hope he doesn't fall down in the shower in the jail.
[00:48:16.813 --> 00:48:18.054]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:18.834 --> 00:48:20.235]  It's irritating.
[00:48:22.416 --> 00:48:23.897]  I just hope he doesn't fall and hit his head.
[00:48:23.917 --> 00:48:25.998]  You know what?
[00:48:26.078 --> 00:48:34.302]  I'm really sick of people like this that attack old people, that attack women, that attack children, and it makes me want to throw up
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.281]  And I see this over and over again.
[00:48:37.301 --> 00:48:38.361]  I just want to tell all the criminals.
[00:48:38.461 --> 00:48:40.982]  You come in my house, I'm going to unload into your torso.
[00:48:41.342 --> 00:48:44.583]  Well, you know, I collect classic cars.
[00:48:45.143 --> 00:48:46.503]  Live with myself, I'm single.
[00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:52.765]  And maybe he had an idea of getting one of my cars or something.
[00:48:52.965 --> 00:48:59.927]  But he walked by the neighbors and the sheriff said, why in the hell did he walk all the way out from town?
[00:48:59.947 --> 00:49:01.888]  Well, I said, I don't know.
[00:49:03.919 --> 00:49:06.981]  I sure depend on my guns for security.
[00:49:08.682 --> 00:49:10.023]  And what'd the police officer say?
[00:49:10.043 --> 00:49:17.088]  He said, I know, I hate like hell to take these guns, and I'll do all I can to help you get them back.
[00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:21.331]  According to Farm King, that may be 60 days or... You know what?
[00:49:21.671 --> 00:49:22.492]  Yeah, 60 days.
[00:49:22.532 --> 00:49:24.373]  They need to... That is disgusting.
[00:49:24.393 --> 00:49:28.816]  And now this scumbag... There have been cases where criminals fall through skylights.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:32.601]  And then sue the people's house they fell into.
[00:49:32.961 --> 00:49:34.382]  Isn't that ridiculous?
[00:49:35.582 --> 00:49:37.022]  I can't, that's not right.
[00:49:37.242 --> 00:49:43.464]  Well, the reason, the courts, a lot of these socialist courts are actually on their side because they don't like you defending yourself.
[00:49:43.764 --> 00:49:47.446]  Have you heard the stories of in England you defend yourself in your own home and they charge you?
[00:49:48.326 --> 00:49:49.386]  Yeah, I know.
[00:49:50.366 --> 00:49:58.409]  Somebody goes hunting across my land, which is supposed to be no hunting, and they break a leg like an old whale or something, I'm accountable.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.180]  And I don't agree with that.
[00:50:02.921 --> 00:50:05.541]  Well, it's just general craziness is what it is.
[00:50:05.561 --> 00:50:07.441]  Yes, it is.
[00:50:08.122 --> 00:50:09.402]  Well, we need to... You know what?
[00:50:09.542 --> 00:50:21.464]  I'm going to hold you over for the break, sir, but I want to get your... I want to give you my number, and if this punk sues you or anything happens, I know we've got a lot of listeners in Illinois.
[00:50:21.504 --> 00:50:22.784]  What area of Illinois are you in?
[00:50:23.864 --> 00:50:25.284]  Are you where Peoria is?
[00:50:26.125 --> 00:50:26.565]  Peoria?
[00:50:26.745 --> 00:50:28.045]  Yes, just describe the area.
[00:50:28.952 --> 00:50:33.535]  I'm about 70 miles southwest of Peoria.
[00:50:34.676 --> 00:50:36.897]  About 40 miles from the Mississippi River.
[00:50:37.718 --> 00:50:39.879]  Well, folks in that area need to come to your aid.
[00:50:39.899 --> 00:50:41.140]  Your neighbors need to.
[00:50:41.900 --> 00:50:50.465]  Well, hey, I went to the family restaurant this morning and I couldn't believe the people came over and shook my hand and said, we admire you.
[00:50:50.485 --> 00:50:52.807]  You're a hero and we need more people like you.
[00:50:52.827 --> 00:50:54.027]  Hey, well, stay there.
[00:50:54.067 --> 00:50:54.888]  We got a break, sir.
[00:50:55.831 --> 00:50:58.552]  He flew with the Flying Tigers, Leonard Damage.
[00:50:58.992 --> 00:51:00.913]  Now his guns have been taken.
[00:51:01.573 --> 00:51:03.074]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.274 --> 00:51:06.355]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.495 --> 00:51:10.397]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:14.678]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.019 --> 00:51:18.800]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:20.741]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.341 --> 00:51:24.242]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.282 --> 00:51:28.984]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.144 --> 00:51:32.185]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.365 --> 00:51:35.226]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.706 --> 00:51:41.828]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.368 --> 00:51:46.152]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.573 --> 00:51:47.934]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.275 --> 00:51:49.336]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.376 --> 00:51:51.678]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:51:51.698 --> 00:51:53.120]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[00:52:01.076 --> 00:52:04.979]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.219 --> 00:52:10.643]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.923 --> 00:52:21.290]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:25.793]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.973 --> 00:52:26.774]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.947 --> 00:52:41.407]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:02.730]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.575 --> 00:53:18.216]  We're good to go!
[00:53:47.094 --> 00:53:50.196]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:50.356 --> 00:53:56.218]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:09.113 --> 00:54:26.367]  Leonard Gamage, when you were an officer of the Flying Tigers there in China for 20 months, then later of course in the Air Force after that with a long career, did you ever imagine that in 2004 that police would come to your house after you defended yourself and would take your firearms?
[00:54:28.769 --> 00:54:29.389]  That's true.
[00:54:31.311 --> 00:54:33.192]  I retired as a Lieutenant Colonel.
[00:54:33.673 --> 00:54:35.895]  But did you ever imagine that that would happen to you?
[00:54:36.195 --> 00:54:37.496]  Never, never, never.
[00:54:39.622 --> 00:54:40.942]  I mean, what's happened to our country?
[00:54:42.303 --> 00:54:43.223]  Isn't it sad?
[00:54:43.843 --> 00:54:44.143]  Really?
[00:54:44.363 --> 00:54:46.383]  And those guys that die every day in Iraq.
[00:54:46.924 --> 00:54:48.304]  What a horrible shame.
[00:54:49.684 --> 00:54:50.244]  Terrible.
[00:54:52.165 --> 00:54:54.225]  And then, what's America turning into?
[00:54:54.505 --> 00:54:55.686]  Well, that's what worries me.
[00:54:55.726 --> 00:55:03.687]  That's, you know, that's what I call my neighbor, Tom Friday, because I knew he'd be here quick.
[00:55:04.507 --> 00:55:04.948]  And he was.
[00:55:09.338 --> 00:55:14.266]  Bottom line, I hope you get your guns back, and I'm glad people are giving you support in the community.
[00:55:14.286 --> 00:55:21.197]  Yeah, they have super fun, and they do have papers on the local television stations.
[00:55:22.293 --> 00:55:25.474]  I think it was on Channel 7 here this morning again.
[00:55:26.174 --> 00:55:38.478]  You know what I feel sorry for is these single women with children, and the man's run off or whatever, and the woman's been so brainwashed about guns being bad that she hasn't gone out and taken a lesson.
[00:55:38.518 --> 00:55:42.480]  She'd get an instant access pistol safe where the gun's safe and locked up.
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.960]  Why wouldn't these people go?
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:45.701]  Because all the time they get raped and killed.
[00:55:45.921 --> 00:55:48.382]  Yeah, yeah, that's just terrible.
[00:55:49.022 --> 00:55:49.382]  Bad.
[00:55:50.816 --> 00:55:55.780]  You mentioned you might give me your telephone number in case I'd like to get in touch with you.
[00:55:56.141 --> 00:55:56.461]  Yes, sir.
[00:55:56.801 --> 00:55:58.863]  We're about to go out to break and I'll give that to you.
[00:55:58.903 --> 00:56:00.324]  I know you've got to go.
[00:56:00.344 --> 00:56:01.965]  Do you have a doctor's appointment or something today?
[00:56:02.146 --> 00:56:03.106]  No, no, no.
[00:56:03.166 --> 00:56:13.575]  The chef's coming down here at 1230 to make a video of the farm and me and make a detailed take of that position.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.502]  Alright, well I hope they don't pull something.
[00:56:19.062 --> 00:56:23.626]  It sounds like public opinion is on your side, but I've seen cases in the United States.
[00:56:24.587 --> 00:56:28.770]  I saw a case where it was like an 85 year old man.
[00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:32.913]  We even had him on a couple years ago and the guys busted in and were beating him up in his bedroom.
[00:56:33.093 --> 00:56:33.654]  Yeah.
[00:56:33.954 --> 00:56:37.757]  And he shot and killed one and wounded the other and last time I heard he got in some trouble.
[00:56:38.518 --> 00:56:39.819]  Isn't that disgusting?
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.821]  I don't buy that at all.
[00:56:43.121 --> 00:56:44.522]  Well it's just upside down.
[00:56:44.542 --> 00:56:44.842]  Yeah.
[00:56:46.627 --> 00:56:50.670]  Yeah, the bums get more protection and more respect in the court.
[00:56:52.171 --> 00:56:54.093]  Well, that's because you've got bums running the courts.
[00:56:54.513 --> 00:56:55.814]  Yeah, well, that's true too.
[00:56:57.535 --> 00:57:02.799]  You know... If folks want to... Your name is in information.
[00:57:02.839 --> 00:57:08.443]  If somebody wants to take the time to get a hold of you or... It's in the local directory, yes.
[00:57:08.903 --> 00:57:12.166]  If folks want to support you somehow that are in Illinois,
[00:57:13.172 --> 00:57:16.535]  Just don't forget that if you have any problems, just again, call me.
[00:57:16.935 --> 00:57:17.716]  Good.
[00:57:18.377 --> 00:57:21.839]  And I'll try to get you some support going because there's no telling what's going to come out of this.
[00:57:21.879 --> 00:57:23.681]  Yeah, I'm worried about it, Billy.
[00:57:24.101 --> 00:57:25.142]  Well, you shouldn't be too worried.
[00:57:25.162 --> 00:57:26.163]  You'll probably be okay.
[00:57:26.183 --> 00:57:27.264]  In most of these cases, you are.
[00:57:27.604 --> 00:57:36.051]  But there are certain people, especially in Illinois and New York, that want to make an example, that want to make people think it's illegal to defend yourself.
[00:57:36.572 --> 00:57:37.673]  Like the whistleblowers.
[00:57:37.733 --> 00:57:40.295]  Look what trouble they go to and how they're treated.
[00:57:41.832 --> 00:57:43.813]  You know, that's too bad.
[00:57:43.833 --> 00:57:45.895]  Well, I'm supposed to be writing a book, but I procrastinate a lot.
[00:57:45.915 --> 00:57:47.636]  I enjoy, you know, beer and cars and chasing around.
[00:57:48.256 --> 00:57:51.419]  Yeah, you know, to tell you the truth, I felt good about that after it was over.
[00:58:09.449 --> 00:58:10.409]  Yeah, that's all good.
[00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:14.331]  And I like my body for standing up to it.
[00:58:16.031 --> 00:58:20.053]  If you're hit once with a pipe, you can't use that arm again.
[00:58:20.073 --> 00:58:21.513]  It's sterilized.
[00:58:21.533 --> 00:58:28.516]  So if he'd hit me with a pipe or something like that, I would have been helpless.
[00:58:30.577 --> 00:58:31.537]  Well, God bless you.
[00:58:31.597 --> 00:58:33.278]  I know you got the sheriff coming out.
[00:58:34.855 --> 00:58:36.717]  So you probably need to leave us now, don't you?
[00:58:36.918 --> 00:58:39.841]  Well, yeah, it'll probably be a couple hours.
[00:58:40.402 --> 00:58:43.025]  Okay, well let me keep you a little bit into the next segment then, okay?
[00:58:43.305 --> 00:58:44.106]  Okay, good.
[00:58:44.146 --> 00:58:45.868]  Okay, let me give you my phone number during the break.
[00:58:46.128 --> 00:58:46.509]  Okay, good.
[00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:48.391]  We're going to take some calls.
[00:58:48.591 --> 00:58:49.132]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:58.621]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.321 --> 00:59:00.341]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:02.182]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.842 --> 00:59:03.662]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.422 --> 00:59:05.322]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.983 --> 00:59:09.884]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.164 --> 00:59:14.305]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.985 --> 00:59:18.486]  Well, if you missed the last 30 minutes, you missed it.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:21.322]  Amazing interview, he's still with us.
[00:59:21.842 --> 00:59:24.384]  The Macomb Journal, a lot of other papers in Illinois.
[00:59:24.925 --> 00:59:37.156]  Resident captures intruder, Leonard Gamage, 87 years old, top Flying Tiger, an officer over the Flying Tigers in combat.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.821]  Punk comes in, busts in his house, assaults him.
[00:59:42.101 --> 00:59:44.582]  The old guy beats him back out in the yard.
[00:59:44.602 --> 00:59:45.802]  The guy tries to come back in.
[00:59:46.202 --> 00:59:47.323]  He fires warning shots.
[00:59:47.343 --> 00:59:48.103]  The guy keeps coming.
[00:59:48.143 --> 00:59:49.003]  He shoots him in the foot.
[00:59:49.383 --> 00:59:55.085]  Again, I ought to put a nice little pattern, a nice little smiley face right in that guy's chest and one in the head as he's falling.
[00:59:55.506 --> 00:59:56.186]  I'm sorry, folks.
[00:59:56.246 --> 00:59:57.566]  It's just what you're supposed to do.
[00:59:58.046 --> 00:59:59.307]  He was lenient, I guess.
[00:59:59.367 --> 01:00:03.028]  A lot of folks, as they get older in many cases, love life more, and I understand that.
[01:00:03.348 --> 01:00:05.389]  I've experienced that myself, and I'm not even that old.
[01:00:06.318 --> 01:00:12.363]  But then the cops came out and confiscated his two firearms, including a rifle that his father had given him.
[01:00:12.423 --> 01:00:13.504]  His father's rifle.
[01:00:14.245 --> 01:00:15.966]  And I know we got loaded phone lines here.
[01:00:15.986 --> 01:00:17.928]  We're just going to keep you about 15 more minutes.
[01:00:17.948 --> 01:00:21.231]  I know the sheriff's coming back out to your house today for a deposition.
[01:00:22.192 --> 01:00:24.413]  But right now, let's take some calls.
[01:00:24.473 --> 01:00:24.874]  Okay, sir?
[01:00:26.184 --> 01:00:26.444]  Good!
[01:00:26.744 --> 01:00:30.667]  Okay, let's talk to Bruce in Illinois, then we'll go to Albert, Charles, Tim, and Scott.
[01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:31.727]  Bruce, go ahead.
[01:00:31.967 --> 01:00:32.548]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:00:32.988 --> 01:00:37.311]  The permit that Leonard here is talking about, I believe is the Illinois FOID card.
[01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:40.993]  I think that's why the sheriff confiscated those guns.
[01:00:41.193 --> 01:00:42.234]  It's still disgusting!
[01:00:42.614 --> 01:00:47.997]  Well, it's absolutely disgusting, and what's really bad is, you know, the FOID card is an enforcement mechanism.
[01:00:48.652 --> 01:00:52.994]  And if any of these gun ban or confiscation laws are ever passed in Illinois, they know where to get them.
[01:00:53.034 --> 01:00:57.296]  It will be enforced through the FOID card application renewal process.
[01:00:57.876 --> 01:01:10.381]  And that's why it's so important, if the people in this state, which I'm a member of in this state, would make the phone calls and demand that this FOID card be repealed, Leonard here would not be, would still have his firearms.
[01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:15.003]  And to take that Stevens away, that belonged to his dad, a bold action Stevens,
[01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.692]  Hey, Leonard, is that a .22 Bolt Action Stevens?
[01:01:17.712 --> 01:01:19.313]  That's true, yeah.
[01:01:19.653 --> 01:01:21.435]  Sir, that is a classic firearm.
[01:01:21.635 --> 01:01:22.716]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:22.856 --> 01:01:24.497]  I'm one of the deep-feeling sports.
[01:01:25.278 --> 01:01:28.760]  Yeah, and for you to lose that, that is an absolute, utter disgrace.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:41.791]  And I'll tell you something, Alex, the State Rifle Association in this state, when this FOID card first came out, when it was proposed in the mid-1960s, there was a lot of racial tensions and racial violence with race riots in Chicago.
[01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:43.192]  Yeah, it's a racial law, yeah.
[01:01:43.891 --> 01:01:51.676]  And what people need to understand is that that FOID card is technically a compromise between the NRA state affiliate and the state of Illinois.
[01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:53.417]  That's how we got that Philly law.
[01:01:54.057 --> 01:01:55.318]  And we need to repeal that law.
[01:01:55.338 --> 01:01:58.079]  Hey, I catch the NRA all the time supporting gun laws.
[01:01:58.299 --> 01:01:59.720]  Well, that was a compromise.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:07.405]  See, the original proposal, Alex, was that the state of Illinois was going to register every firearm in this state for $5 per firearm.
[01:02:07.845 --> 01:02:08.265]  Well, in 1960's money,
[01:02:10.233 --> 01:02:12.195]  You know, if you had ten guns, that's fifty bucks.
[01:02:12.335 --> 01:02:15.638]  That's so much money that what they've done is they've compromised.
[01:02:15.678 --> 01:02:21.383]  And the compromise was that they would register every gun owner for five dollars over a period of five years.
[01:02:21.843 --> 01:02:27.088]  Leonard, do you remember that FOID card when it first came out and how they tried to register all the guns?
[01:02:27.268 --> 01:02:28.389]  Yes, yes, I remember that.
[01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:37.897]  Okay, well, see, you know, and the reason you've lost your guns, because I'll tell you, that's such a disgrace, but you've lost your guns because the NRA state affiliate here in Illinois
[01:02:38.311 --> 01:02:49.917]  The NRA has supported that thing, and even in the Chicago Tribune, Alex, even all the way back into October, there were still stories in the Chicago Tribune of how the State Rifle Association still supports this FOID card.
[01:02:50.157 --> 01:02:52.239]  We need to contact the State Rifle Association.
[01:02:52.259 --> 01:02:57.942]  No, the NRA, I've caught them in Texas, all over, supporting gun laws, folks.
[01:02:58.022 --> 01:03:00.303]  And I'm a liberal because I'm against it.
[01:03:00.723 --> 01:03:07.045]  We have to demand that the State Rifle Association, the ISRA.org, stop supporting that FOID card.
[01:03:07.085 --> 01:03:07.645]  Now, I hear you.
[01:03:07.665 --> 01:03:09.345]  We need to get a real Second Amendment group.
[01:03:09.365 --> 01:03:09.886]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:09.926 --> 01:03:10.066]  Yeah.
[01:03:10.146 --> 01:03:10.826]  Hey, thank you, Leonard.
[01:03:11.006 --> 01:03:11.226]  Bye.
[01:03:12.146 --> 01:03:14.827]  Leonard, I tell you, that's true, and that makes me angry.
[01:03:15.007 --> 01:03:16.047]  Yeah, me too.
[01:03:16.707 --> 01:03:18.568]  And I feel defenseless right now.
[01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:22.309]  Well, now, you've gone and gotten your little permission card now.
[01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:24.130]  You should be able to go out and buy another gun.
[01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:26.190]  Well, I'm thinking about that.
[01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:29.371]  You need to go directly to the gun shop
[01:03:30.054 --> 01:03:33.796]  And this time you need to buy yourself a .357 revolver.
[01:03:33.956 --> 01:03:34.896]  Nice, simple action.
[01:03:34.916 --> 01:03:35.776]  You know what to do with it.
[01:03:36.277 --> 01:03:38.758]  And if anybody comes back over there, you know what to do.
[01:03:38.958 --> 01:03:39.738]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:03:40.118 --> 01:03:42.119]  And remember, always put one in the brain.
[01:03:42.639 --> 01:03:44.560]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:46.661]  Folks, that's natural instinct.
[01:03:46.701 --> 01:03:50.903]  Somebody comes in your nest, comes in your hole, let them have it.
[01:03:50.943 --> 01:03:51.563]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:55.916 --> 01:04:01.381]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.821 --> 01:04:06.044]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:04:06.285 --> 01:04:13.330]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.691 --> 01:04:19.816]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.956 --> 01:04:21.157]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.497 --> 01:04:24.458]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:04:24.598 --> 01:04:26.619]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:04:26.939 --> 01:04:34.162]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:06:02.012 --> 01:06:06.395]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[01:06:09.558 --> 01:06:13.799]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[01:06:34.727 --> 01:06:36.368]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:36.388 --> 01:06:37.829]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.486 --> 01:07:04.767]  This is how small the world is.
[01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:17.095]  Leonard Gamage, 87, had been in the hospital two days before because of a horribly bad nosebleed with a cold he had.
[01:07:17.155 --> 01:07:18.156]  Lost a lot of blood.
[01:07:18.196 --> 01:07:19.757]  Doctors said stay in bed for two days.
[01:07:21.838 --> 01:07:25.140]  Two days later, thug comes, tries to bust in his house.
[01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:26.321]  He fist fights him.
[01:07:27.225 --> 01:07:28.486]  They wrestle all over the floor.
[01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:32.827]  The 87-year-old man gets the 20-year-old punk outside.
[01:07:32.867 --> 01:07:33.888]  The punk comes back in.
[01:07:33.908 --> 01:07:36.589]  He pulls his rifle his daddy gave him.
[01:07:37.790 --> 01:07:38.790]  Pulls him back off.
[01:07:40.611 --> 01:07:41.591]  Shoots him in the ankle.
[01:07:41.651 --> 01:07:46.053]  Something I'm going to tell you right now I wouldn't have done, but he's got more lenience than I have.
[01:07:47.174 --> 01:07:49.395]  And the police come and take his guns!
[01:07:50.735 --> 01:07:52.596]  That's Illinois for you and a lot of other states.
[01:07:53.943 --> 01:08:07.431]  And, uh, Leonard Gamage was, uh, again, a senior member of the Flying Tigers, 20 months in-country in China, and of course went and stayed in the Air Force and retired as a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S.
[01:08:07.471 --> 01:08:07.911]  Air Force.
[01:08:08.291 --> 01:08:13.634]  And this is how we treat, uh, this combat veteran of World War II.
[01:08:15.455 --> 01:08:16.876]  From the Flying Tigers, folks.
[01:08:18.056 --> 01:08:20.438]  Uh, let's, uh, this is classic.
[01:08:20.478 --> 01:08:22.579]  It just illustrates everything.
[01:08:24.036 --> 01:08:25.557]  Of course it would happen to somebody like him.
[01:08:25.577 --> 01:08:27.018]  Well, it's happened to everybody else, too.
[01:08:27.398 --> 01:08:34.443]  And for all the police and the firemen and the folks that are good out there, you know this is gonna happen to your parents, it's gonna happen to you when you're old.
[01:08:35.004 --> 01:08:35.724]  It's wrong.
[01:08:36.585 --> 01:08:37.205]  It's wrong.
[01:08:38.166 --> 01:08:41.829]  They leave him defenseless out there so this punk's friends could come back by there.
[01:08:43.610 --> 01:08:46.952]  Let's go ahead and talk to Albert in Florida.
[01:08:47.052 --> 01:08:48.073]  Albert, thanks for holding.
[01:08:48.613 --> 01:08:49.154]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:50.063 --> 01:08:51.925]  A question for you off the subject.
[01:08:52.045 --> 01:09:01.654]  Is there a plan by the United States government to take over cities in the United States and turn them into corporations, therefore they can control the infrastructure of this company?
[01:09:01.994 --> 01:09:04.277]  Yes, it's called privatization.
[01:09:04.637 --> 01:09:07.940]  The prisons, the electrical, the water, everything.
[01:09:08.401 --> 01:09:09.722]  And it's not privatization.
[01:09:09.742 --> 01:09:14.006]  It's really they socialize the wealth that's handed over to key corporations.
[01:09:14.466 --> 01:09:16.168]  So it's a corporate looting.
[01:09:17.113 --> 01:09:21.656]  So the cities are turned into corporations, and that actually changes their structure and their laws?
[01:09:21.776 --> 01:09:32.462]  Well, they've actually always been corporations, but then the quasi-governmental, since cities were set up, but they were always quasi-governmental, operating under state law.
[01:09:32.863 --> 01:09:38.026]  Now, sections of cities, key infrastructures, are being sold off for pennies on the dollar.
[01:09:38.446 --> 01:09:40.708]  The companies pay off the politicians.
[01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:44.250]  The politicians then hand over the assets to private corporations.
[01:09:44.830 --> 01:09:49.893]  And don't we lose more and more of our sovereignty and our rights as the federal government turns it into a corporation?
[01:09:49.933 --> 01:09:53.035]  Doesn't that give them more of an opportunity to get in and get to the boss?
[01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:54.936]  Yeah, don't they say you can't see our books?
[01:09:54.976 --> 01:09:55.396]  Exactly.
[01:09:55.996 --> 01:09:56.837]  Yeah, that's something else.
[01:09:56.897 --> 01:09:57.857]  Any comments for our guest?
[01:09:58.598 --> 01:10:04.661]  Yeah, I think he needs to get that sheriff to come down there and stand guard outside his house unarmed until they give him his rifles back.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:06.440]  Well, that's right.
[01:10:06.741 --> 01:10:08.662]  Walk a mile in Leonard's shoes.
[01:10:08.782 --> 01:10:10.963]  I mean, imagine telling the cops, hey, give us your guns.
[01:10:11.023 --> 01:10:14.305]  Go out and do your job with all these dangerous people without guns.
[01:10:14.725 --> 01:10:17.007]  Yeah, just let him stand out there unarmed so he can...
[01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:20.782]  Take these assailants on, you know, while they come with their, you know, their guns.
[01:10:20.802 --> 01:10:24.625]  Yeah, let's see if this, uh, if this sheriff can do what an 87-year-old man did.
[01:10:24.925 --> 01:10:28.108]  I think it used to be, you know, protective custody or protection or whatever.
[01:10:28.128 --> 01:10:30.430]  I mean, he has to have some kind of rights where they gotta protect them.
[01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:32.712]  Well, the federal courts have ruled, and so have state courts.
[01:10:32.732 --> 01:10:35.535]  They have no obligation to protect us, but then they still want our guns.
[01:10:35.575 --> 01:10:36.135]  Thanks for the call.
[01:10:36.155 --> 01:10:37.997]  That's a good point he just made, Leonard.
[01:10:38.137 --> 01:10:39.038]  That's a good point.
[01:10:39.318 --> 01:10:39.879]  Good point.
[01:10:41.658 --> 01:10:49.880]  Well, we should all... I ought to get the number to the McDonald County and the seats there in... I'll give you the Sheriff's number.
[01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:53.801]  So your code is 309... Well, let me write this down.
[01:10:53.841 --> 01:10:54.721]  Everybody get a pen and paper.
[01:10:54.741 --> 01:10:54.721]  309... 833... 2323.
[01:10:54.801 --> 01:10:55.741]  2323.
[01:10:54.981 --> 01:10:55.741]  You want us to call him?
[01:10:55.761 --> 01:10:59.622]  Well, um... Let's see how this turns out.
[01:10:59.642 --> 01:11:00.442]  He's a nice guy, really.
[01:11:11.135 --> 01:11:12.616]  I mean, sure what I mean.
[01:11:12.696 --> 01:11:16.978]  I mean, he's, uh, he did seem reluctant to take my guns.
[01:11:17.198 --> 01:11:18.639]  But that makes it even worse.
[01:11:18.679 --> 01:11:21.120]  It means he has conscious knowledge of what he's doing is wrong.
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.623]  Yeah, you know, you've got a point there.
[01:11:25.643 --> 01:11:27.343]  Yeah, I know.
[01:11:27.363 --> 01:11:27.604]  309-833-2323.
[01:11:27.744 --> 01:11:28.624]  Yeah.
[01:11:28.864 --> 01:11:32.106]  Look, police turn blind eyes to their own real corruption every day.
[01:11:32.126 --> 01:11:34.527]  Why don't they do it for something that's obviously ridiculous?
[01:11:34.887 --> 01:11:35.988]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:38.130]  3-0-9-8-3-3-23-23-23?
[01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:39.911]  That's it.
[01:11:41.152 --> 01:11:46.314]  Okay, people call, just nicely say, give the old veteran his guns back, or get out there and protect him.
[01:11:46.694 --> 01:11:49.375]  Well, I appreciate that, because I am nervous.
[01:11:49.655 --> 01:11:51.596]  Well, this punk told you I'm going to get you.
[01:11:52.056 --> 01:11:52.917]  Yeah, he did.
[01:11:54.057 --> 01:11:56.018]  Well, let's go ahead and make another call.
[01:11:56.138 --> 01:11:57.439]  Charles in Louisiana.
[01:11:57.459 --> 01:11:58.359]  You're on the air, Charles.
[01:11:58.459 --> 01:11:59.440]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:11:59.880]  Good.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.681]  Did you hear what happened to Louisiana last night?
[01:12:03.101 --> 01:12:04.122]  It was on the news.
[01:12:05.746 --> 01:12:08.032]  Escaped convict, uh, was supposed to escape.
[01:12:08.052 --> 01:12:10.258]  They wouldn't give his name or his description.
[01:12:10.278 --> 01:12:13.064]  They blocked off the streets and started going door to door.
[01:12:14.508 --> 01:12:16.470]  It's on Channel 9 News, Baton Rouge.
[01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:26.117]  I know up in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, they cordoned off the whole neighborhood and confiscated all the guns.
[01:12:26.257 --> 01:12:30.240]  Well here, this is just what I guess they confiscated the guns last night.
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.002]  The people just love them though, Mr. Jones.
[01:12:32.062 --> 01:12:33.883]  They're like, come on in, come on in.
[01:12:33.903 --> 01:12:38.286]  They're just running up there with their camouflage and their helmets, the police in their
[01:12:39.247 --> 01:12:41.688]  How many areas did they search?
[01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:59.906]  And the guy I gave one of your tapes to... So the police officer you talked to was... Yeah, well, a guy I gave your tapes to.
[01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:05.009]  He said, you know, these people here, he said, they bred, they bred for this.
[01:13:05.349 --> 01:13:06.870]  He said, this is pitiful.
[01:13:06.890 --> 01:13:08.791]  This be my house, and I'll be fine.
[01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:09.892]  The police told me that.
[01:13:10.272 --> 01:13:12.914]  And they just come on in, you should have seen them open the doors and...
[01:13:13.504 --> 01:13:16.606]  Telling people, get against the walls, and police up there.
[01:13:16.746 --> 01:13:19.368]  So it's not just, oh yes, put me up against the wall!
[01:13:19.589 --> 01:13:22.090]  And they do this now, they don't even know where the convicts at.
[01:13:22.311 --> 01:13:23.672]  Let's just treat everybody like criminals.
[01:13:23.812 --> 01:13:26.354]  Mr. Jones, believe this man, I love you man.
[01:13:26.554 --> 01:13:28.075]  But the people want this.
[01:13:28.575 --> 01:13:30.537]  Like this guy talking about, we need to get this law.
[01:13:30.697 --> 01:13:32.158]  They ain't supposed to fool with no guns.
[01:13:32.258 --> 01:13:33.399]  They ain't supposed to have no laws.
[01:13:33.639 --> 01:13:34.740]  You got a right to bear arms.
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.742]  And the people, oh we need to get rid of this law and that law.
[01:13:37.982 --> 01:13:38.723]  Like this last caller.
[01:13:38.963 --> 01:13:40.084]  These people need this.
[01:13:40.304 --> 01:13:42.866]  They need to all go to prison for a year, that way they'll learn the law.
[01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:44.987]  They don't know what terrority is.
[01:13:45.408 --> 01:13:46.648]  But they opened the door.
[01:13:46.668 --> 01:13:47.369]  You should have seen them.
[01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:48.349]  They were so happy.
[01:13:48.710 --> 01:13:49.530]  They were being protected.
[01:13:50.151 --> 01:13:51.611]  I called up and said, what does the guy look like?
[01:13:51.651 --> 01:13:52.512]  We're not seeing him.
[01:13:52.812 --> 01:13:53.433]  What is his name?
[01:13:53.453 --> 01:13:53.953]  We're not seeing him.
[01:13:54.013 --> 01:13:55.114]  Why not tell the people?
[01:13:55.154 --> 01:13:56.695]  Just take a look for him.
[01:13:56.715 --> 01:13:57.915]  I called the sheriff's office.
[01:13:57.935 --> 01:14:03.779]  Back when we were a free country, back when we were a free country, that all the men would have been out with their rifles.
[01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:04.500]  We're the police.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:04.920]  Find him.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.281]  They would have found him in ten minutes.
[01:14:06.861 --> 01:14:12.303]  Uh, well... But instead, let's send the police out and have them going until people are putting their hands up being searched.
[01:14:12.504 --> 01:14:14.184]  Oh yeah, they were going into houses.
[01:14:15.445 --> 01:14:16.665]  They were going house to house.
[01:14:16.765 --> 01:14:18.706]  Like one house, they come out, another house.
[01:14:18.746 --> 01:14:19.987]  Then they come out, another house.
[01:14:20.227 --> 01:14:21.567]  Let me get a comment from our guest.
[01:14:21.627 --> 01:14:21.908]  Leonard?
[01:14:22.308 --> 01:14:22.688]  Uh, yes.
[01:14:23.328 --> 01:14:24.168]  What do you think about that?
[01:14:24.389 --> 01:14:26.870]  Well, you know, I'm as disturbed as you people are.
[01:14:28.010 --> 01:14:32.872]  It's... I don't know what I can do about it, but... It's very disturbing to see
[01:14:35.279 --> 01:14:39.561]  Tony, disregard our safety!
[01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:49.164]  Well, look, number one, tactics-wise, just running into neighborhoods wildly, putting people's hands up against walls and putting guns to them, that isn't how you find people.
[01:14:49.424 --> 01:14:54.466]  You put their picture on the news, and the police drive around giving the description, and they find them.
[01:14:54.486 --> 01:14:56.747]  That's how it used to work back when this country was free.
[01:14:57.007 --> 01:14:58.148]  They just said ex-convict.
[01:14:58.168 --> 01:14:59.028]  They wouldn't give the name.
[01:14:59.088 --> 01:15:00.048]  Everybody asked, who is it?
[01:15:00.269 --> 01:15:01.269]  We're not going to say the name.
[01:15:01.329 --> 01:15:03.530]  I bet you money that was a drill.
[01:15:04.170 --> 01:15:08.433]  If you're on Channel 9 News, Dot News, you can pull it up on the website.
[01:15:08.594 --> 01:15:11.236]  I've been calling all morning, everybody, telling them to pull it up.
[01:15:11.516 --> 01:15:15.799]  But you see the people, they need, these people need to be in FEMA Care.
[01:15:16.019 --> 01:15:17.541]  They are so dumbed down.
[01:15:17.901 --> 01:15:19.162]  They are so stupid.
[01:15:19.622 --> 01:15:24.046]  I mean, they didn't have walking around sense, Mr. Jones.
[01:15:24.466 --> 01:15:25.307]  They loved it.
[01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:26.728]  It was attention to them.
[01:15:27.852 --> 01:15:30.414]  I can't believe even the police said how stupid they were!
[01:15:30.694 --> 01:15:32.655]  The police said how stupid they were!
[01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:34.135]  If that'd be me, that'd never happen.
[01:15:34.876 --> 01:15:37.077]  What did your police officer friends say about it?
[01:15:37.097 --> 01:15:37.897]  Huh?
[01:15:38.357 --> 01:15:41.119]  I said, man, they're going up there to get their results.
[01:15:41.179 --> 01:15:41.719]  Alex?
[01:15:41.999 --> 01:15:42.319]  Yes, sir?
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:44.120]  I've got to leave you.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:44.961]  Oh, the sheriff's there?
[01:15:44.981 --> 01:15:45.881]  Oh, wait a minute.
[01:15:45.921 --> 01:15:46.141]  Mr. Alex?
[01:15:47.162 --> 01:15:49.623]  Hold on a second.
[01:15:49.663 --> 01:15:50.624]  Leonard, are you there?
[01:15:55.649 --> 01:15:56.550]  Yeah, well, Dad's out of here.
[01:15:57.150 --> 01:15:57.611]  Oh, well.
[01:15:57.631 --> 01:16:01.554]  Uh, this is Tom Friday, the, uh, guy that helped me.
[01:16:02.174 --> 01:16:03.355]  He came over to see if it was okay.
[01:16:03.395 --> 01:16:04.636]  You want to speak to him a little bit?
[01:16:05.617 --> 01:16:05.918]  Sure.
[01:16:05.938 --> 01:16:07.399]  Hey, uh, Charles.
[01:16:07.519 --> 01:16:07.979]  Hang on.
[01:16:08.259 --> 01:16:09.260]  Charles, thanks for the call.
[01:16:10.061 --> 01:16:13.063]  I appreciate your call, and, um, we're going to talk to his neighbor.
[01:16:14.625 --> 01:16:17.627]  And the sheriff's about to be there to go around with a video camera.
[01:16:17.647 --> 01:16:22.131]  I just hope they don't charge this poor guy for not having a permit.
[01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:23.092]  Yeah.
[01:16:25.464 --> 01:16:26.945]  They've already kidnapped his guns.
[01:16:30.407 --> 01:16:31.308]  He's talking to his neighbor.
[01:16:32.068 --> 01:16:32.768]  Mr. Friday?
[01:16:32.989 --> 01:16:33.209]  Yes.
[01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:35.070]  Hey, how you doing?
[01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.930]  Not too bad.
[01:16:36.251 --> 01:16:37.932]  We're on the National Radio Show.
[01:16:38.772 --> 01:16:42.014]  Why, you live next door to quite a hero, Mr. Gammage.
[01:16:42.214 --> 01:16:45.476]  Well, not next door, but not very far away.
[01:16:47.717 --> 01:16:52.360]  Well, can you, just in a minute or two, describe what you saw last Friday night?
[01:16:53.801 --> 01:16:53.981]  Sure.
[01:16:54.722 --> 01:16:55.182]  What happened?
[01:16:56.135 --> 01:17:01.976]  Uh, well, uh, I'm sitting watching television there, and my phone rings, and it's Leonard there.
[01:17:01.996 --> 01:17:13.039]  He's got me on speed dial there, so, uh, I mean, I answer the phone, and he says, uh, Tom, this is Leonard, I need help, and then he hung up there.
[01:17:13.359 --> 01:17:25.141]  And, uh, of course, two nights before that, he had called me, and he had a bad nosebleed, and couldn't get it stopped, and I had to come take him to the hospital, and so I, you know, I didn't know what was wrong.
[01:17:26.024 --> 01:17:28.186]  But two nights later, he's beating up this punk.
[01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:29.447]  What did this punk look like?
[01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:30.727]  Well, he had long, bushy hair.
[01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:35.071]  Wild looking there.
[01:17:35.111 --> 01:17:36.292]  I'm a conservative there.
[01:17:36.512 --> 01:17:38.913]  I've got short hair and all that.
[01:17:51.828 --> 01:17:53.369]  He thought he looked like Charles Manson.
[01:17:57.072 --> 01:17:58.753]  And so you pull up and what do you see?
[01:17:59.694 --> 01:18:02.116]  When I pull up, there stands the colonel.
[01:18:04.017 --> 01:18:06.619]  He's got the kid sitting on the little stone wall there.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:10.562]  He's behind him holding a rifle.
[01:18:11.083 --> 01:18:14.245]  Well I'm surprised that Leonard didn't shoot him in the chest.
[01:18:14.626 --> 01:18:19.810]  Well, when he started saying, I'm going to get you, it started back in the house at him.
[01:18:20.754 --> 01:18:29.800]  You know, that would have been my first inclination to... Well, I tell you what, we got a break.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:31.441]  Stay with us for about five more minutes.
[01:18:31.761 --> 01:18:33.823]  I just want to be able to say bye to you and bye to Leonard.
[01:18:34.203 --> 01:18:36.004]  I want to thank you for helping him out, sir.
[01:18:36.644 --> 01:18:37.365]  Mr. Friday.
[01:18:37.385 --> 01:18:40.607]  And no, he's not from Dragnet, folks.
[01:18:40.787 --> 01:18:41.828]  He's the real Mr. Friday.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:45.267]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:18:45.488 --> 01:18:48.696]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[01:18:48.736 --> 01:18:50.682]  More of your calls straight ahead as well.
[01:18:53.652 --> 01:18:54.212]  Hey, psst.
[01:18:54.632 --> 01:19:00.173]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:19:00.413 --> 01:19:01.474]  You use deodorant, right?
[01:19:01.694 --> 01:19:02.554]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:19:02.734 --> 01:19:05.334]  You obviously wear it to cover up the embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:10.435]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:19:10.655 --> 01:19:11.656]  Check out this new product.
[01:19:11.836 --> 01:19:14.816]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:19.057]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:19:19.377 --> 01:19:22.259]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[01:19:22.419 --> 01:19:28.204]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:29.745]  Now, she wants to share it with you.
[01:19:30.025 --> 01:19:30.826]  Still not convinced?
[01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:31.526]  Try it.
[01:19:31.546 --> 01:19:32.787]  Go ahead, try No-B-O.
[01:19:32.927 --> 01:19:33.908]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:19:35.149 --> 01:19:38.152]  No-BO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.

[01:20:05.148 --> 01:20:11.310]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:20:11.710 --> 01:20:19.633]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:20.033 --> 01:20:25.378]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:20:25.539 --> 01:20:29.302]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:29.682 --> 01:20:31.524]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclainable.

[01:20:54.798 --> 01:21:02.721]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[01:21:02.921 --> 01:21:05.162]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[01:21:05.442 --> 01:21:07.023]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[01:21:07.243 --> 01:21:08.844]  Well, Expert Satellite can help.
[01:21:09.084 --> 01:21:11.204]  And we've done it for hundreds of thousands already.

[01:21:41.362 --> 01:21:42.083]  Call now for complete details.
[01:21:53.893 --> 01:21:54.454]  Hi, folks.
[01:21:54.494 --> 01:21:56.236]  Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[01:21:56.316 --> 01:21:57.558]  The real money folks.
[01:22:00.856 --> 01:22:02.797]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:22:03.277 --> 01:22:04.258]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:22:04.338 --> 01:22:05.738]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:22:05.778 --> 01:22:06.199]  A 5% increase.
[01:22:06.799 --> 01:22:08.480]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[01:22:08.500 --> 01:22:10.901]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[01:22:10.921 --> 01:22:12.642]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[01:22:12.662 --> 01:22:13.742]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:31.382]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:22:31.942 --> 01:22:37.085]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:38.385 --> 01:22:42.308]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[01:22:42.988 --> 01:22:45.930]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:47.791]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:23:02.391 --> 01:23:13.374]  They'd like to make it like England, where you've been robbed three times by the same knife-wielding thug, and you shoot him and injure him, and so they sue you and win, and you go to prison for life.
[01:23:15.615 --> 01:23:17.956]  And they're trying to do that in certain areas of the country.
[01:23:18.596 --> 01:23:21.697]  It's just disgusting, and we're talking to Leonard Gambage,
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:28.942]  Lieutenant Colonel when he retired from the Air Force, a top-flying Tiger in World War II in China against the Japanese.
[01:23:29.462 --> 01:23:30.582]  This is the treatment he gets.
[01:23:31.542 --> 01:23:40.164]  We're talking to one of his neighbors that Leonard called that night and who was the first to show up there before the police.
[01:23:42.225 --> 01:23:43.165]  Talking to Mr. Friday.
[01:23:43.225 --> 01:23:45.205]  Mr. Friday, you were making some comments.
[01:23:45.685 --> 01:23:46.726]  We were talking during the break.
[01:23:48.507 --> 01:23:53.468]  What would you have done if you'd already had a fist fight with somebody and they were about to come back in and they said, I'm going to get you?
[01:23:53.488 --> 01:23:54.108]  What would you have done?
[01:23:54.888 --> 01:23:59.109]  Well, I would have done more than shoot at his feet.
[01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:03.430]  I would have probably aimed at his chest.
[01:24:03.490 --> 01:24:05.311]  I would have done all the damage I could have done.
[01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:06.811]  I'm 67 years old.
[01:24:12.453 --> 01:24:16.636]  And you know, I'm younger than he is and I wouldn't want to fight with him there.
[01:24:16.756 --> 01:24:18.797]  I would want to end him as quick as I could.
[01:24:20.718 --> 01:24:33.926]  I wonder why Mr. Gamage, I mean obviously he's not afraid of doing something like that, I mean going up against those Japanese heroes, but I wonder why he didn't, I guess he just loves life.
[01:24:34.727 --> 01:24:39.630]  He made a choice there to take it easy on the guy, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:44.370]  Yeah, but now that punk or his friends can come back, he sounds like the type.
[01:24:44.390 --> 01:24:51.853]  Well, I would like to say I hope nothing like that happens there.
[01:24:51.873 --> 01:24:58.515]  I mean, the kid had no business back in this area to start with.
[01:24:58.796 --> 01:25:01.877]  It's a private lane there to the house.
[01:25:02.537 --> 01:25:05.218]  Is the punk, is he still in jail?
[01:25:06.314 --> 01:25:07.075]  Uh, I don't know.
[01:25:07.095 --> 01:25:08.836]  I think he made Bond, didn't he?
[01:25:08.876 --> 01:25:10.656]  Yeah, he done, uh, made Bond.
[01:25:10.757 --> 01:25:11.377]  Made Bond!
[01:25:11.417 --> 01:25:14.518]  He's off at houses attacking people, and then he's out.
[01:25:14.819 --> 01:25:16.439]  Yeah.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.881]  No, I'd, uh... Do you know his name?
[01:25:19.441 --> 01:25:25.924]  Uh, James, uh... Uh, Vander... Vanderscum?
[01:25:26.324 --> 01:25:26.945]  Vanderveen.
[01:25:28.045 --> 01:25:28.686]  Vanderveen.
[01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:29.846]  Yeah.
[01:25:29.906 --> 01:25:30.727]  He's 20 years old.
[01:25:31.067 --> 01:25:32.748]  Uh, there he's, uh...
[01:25:34.878 --> 01:25:39.081]  I think it's on Route 66 up by Chicago, Geneva, Illinois.
[01:25:39.522 --> 01:25:40.362]  Oh, that's where he's from?
[01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:40.823]  Yes.
[01:25:41.263 --> 01:25:42.204]  How far away is that?
[01:25:43.024 --> 01:25:46.607]  Oh, that would be a couple hundred miles.
[01:25:47.248 --> 01:25:48.569]  Well, I wonder why he was down there?
[01:25:48.929 --> 01:25:52.372]  Well, he's a student at Western Illinois University.
[01:25:52.852 --> 01:25:53.653]  Oh, down the street.
[01:25:54.434 --> 01:25:59.558]  Yeah, Western University is over here about 10-15 blocks away.
[01:26:01.266 --> 01:26:03.687]  Well, I think the school should expel him.
[01:26:04.067 --> 01:26:05.327]  Colleges in the past would.
[01:26:06.248 --> 01:26:09.229]  I'm not sure... He needs some type of punishment.
[01:26:09.249 --> 01:26:11.469]  People should call that school.
[01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:13.190]  It's Illinois Western?
[01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.171]  Western Illinois University.
[01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:16.591]  Western Illinois University.
[01:26:16.611 --> 01:26:25.574]  You need to call the dean and say, this James Van Der Veen or whatever his name is, is a travesty and he needs to be kicked out of college.
[01:26:27.095 --> 01:26:30.816]  Well, I don't think they can legally do anything until after he would be convicted.
[01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:32.583]  I tell you.
[01:26:35.044 --> 01:26:36.444]  Something needs to happen to him.
[01:26:39.766 --> 01:26:44.808]  I want to thank you Mr. Friday for being a good neighbor and helping out Leonard Gammage.
[01:26:45.108 --> 01:26:49.630]  Does it disgust you to see a veteran, a hero like this being treated like this?
[01:26:52.892 --> 01:26:55.893]  He's a good friend and we're proud of his record.
[01:26:56.593 --> 01:26:58.514]  We're proud of you helping him out.
[01:26:58.534 --> 01:26:59.715]  Can I please talk to him again?
[01:27:06.514 --> 01:27:07.014]  Uh, yeah.
[01:27:07.335 --> 01:27:08.395]  Leonard, I'm going to let you go.
[01:27:08.415 --> 01:27:10.096]  You've got a great neighbor, Mr. Friday.
[01:27:10.356 --> 01:27:11.237]  Yes, he is.
[01:27:11.737 --> 01:27:13.638]  You've got my phone number if you need any help.
[01:27:13.698 --> 01:27:14.678]  Any closing comments?
[01:27:14.859 --> 01:27:16.359]  I appreciate that very much.
[01:27:16.379 --> 01:27:19.021]  If anything big develops, I'll call you.
[01:27:19.321 --> 01:27:19.541]  Alright.
[01:27:19.581 --> 01:27:20.362]  God bless you, sir.
[01:27:20.422 --> 01:27:20.882]  Thank you.
[01:27:21.142 --> 01:27:22.363]  Thanks again.
[01:27:22.883 --> 01:27:23.403]  Take care.
[01:27:23.423 --> 01:27:26.825]  Oh boy, let's go back to the calls.
[01:27:26.905 --> 01:27:27.726]  Tim in Ohio.
[01:27:27.786 --> 01:27:28.546]  Tim, you're on the air.
[01:27:28.606 --> 01:27:29.086]  Go ahead.
[01:27:29.426 --> 01:27:29.907]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:27:29.987 --> 01:27:31.528]  I wanted to echo those words.
[01:27:31.588 --> 01:27:35.790]  God bless Leonard and Mr. Friday for helping him out and remind everyone
[01:27:36.724 --> 01:27:38.105]  Who's a freedom-loving listener.
[01:27:38.825 --> 01:27:41.707]  That resistance to tyranny is obedience to God.
[01:27:43.528 --> 01:27:45.189]  Isn't that a disgusting story, though?
[01:27:45.209 --> 01:27:46.730]  How they come and took his guns.
[01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:47.670]  It just makes you sick.
[01:27:47.890 --> 01:27:55.915]  Well, what we need to do, and it's part of what my organization, Truth, teaching and researching United States treasonous hierarchy, is these type of facts.
[01:27:56.795 --> 01:28:00.737]  Have people do a search on any search engine, Erie versus Tompkins, 1938.
[01:28:00.778 --> 01:28:01.478]  Learn about straw man.
[01:28:03.806 --> 01:28:07.129]  Legal fictions and the color of law from the government style book.
[01:28:07.749 --> 01:28:10.291]  And read your blacks law dictionary.
[01:28:10.311 --> 01:28:14.274]  It's all done with illusions to get you to sign contracts and give up your rights.
[01:28:14.354 --> 01:28:14.795]  Right.
[01:28:15.055 --> 01:28:16.236]  And they call that color of law.
[01:28:16.496 --> 01:28:22.380]  I came across a person that was selling real estate and this man didn't even know the difference between a land patent and a warranty deed.
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:24.522]  There's something else you could just enter into a search engine.
[01:28:24.562 --> 01:28:26.103]  Land patent versus warranty deed.
[01:28:26.564 --> 01:28:30.687]  And you'll find out that you don't really own your property and you've been tricked
[01:28:31.391 --> 01:28:34.472]  into volunteering to pay taxes on that property.
[01:28:34.992 --> 01:28:38.954]  And don't think an attorney, a lawyer, a counselor, or any type of bar... I hear you.
[01:28:38.974 --> 01:28:39.774]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:39.794 --> 01:28:40.274]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.036 --> 01:28:44.976]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.436 --> 01:28:47.057]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.957 --> 01:28:50.658]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.664 --> 01:28:57.245]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[01:28:57.545 --> 01:29:00.046]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.
[01:29:00.246 --> 01:29:08.588]  For almost a decade, our customers have used Hemtab's natural formula to treat the problem at its source, to provide long-lasting relief in even the most severe of cases.
[01:29:08.848 --> 01:29:11.788]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[01:29:12.148 --> 01:29:14.849]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[01:29:15.189 --> 01:29:18.930]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:21.131]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[01:29:21.412 --> 01:29:21.852]  Miracle?
[01:29:22.092 --> 01:29:23.253]  Hem-miracle, we call it.
[01:29:23.453 --> 01:29:24.234]  Thanks, Hemtab!
[01:29:24.414 --> 01:29:26.095]  If you're suffering, there's no need to wait.
[01:29:26.215 --> 01:29:29.017]  We know how the discomfort of hemorrhoids can interrupt your life.
[01:29:29.317 --> 01:29:33.480]  Hemtab is the effective alternative that you can trust to help you take control of your health.

[01:29:45.973 --> 01:29:46.133]  Hemtab.
[01:29:46.494 --> 01:29:47.596]  The effective alternative.
[01:29:53.706 --> 01:29:55.327]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.467 --> 01:29:59.568]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.709 --> 01:30:02.590]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.670 --> 01:30:09.393]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.573 --> 01:30:12.574]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:15.175]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.295 --> 01:30:20.017]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:20.197 --> 01:30:34.781]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:34.921 --> 01:30:41.423]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Murky Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-804-9000.
[01:30:47.065 --> 01:30:58.548]  I'd like to welcome Alan Glasser, a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:30:58.668 --> 01:30:59.068]  Hi, Alan.
[01:30:59.088 --> 01:30:59.908]  Welcome to the program.
[01:31:00.088 --> 01:31:00.648]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:31:00.829 --> 01:31:04.209]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:31:04.370 --> 01:31:04.930]  Is that true?
[01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:05.730]  Yes, Marvin.
[01:31:05.790 --> 01:31:06.110]  It's true.
[01:31:06.150 --> 01:31:09.131]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:31:09.171 --> 01:31:09.411]  price.
[01:31:09.631 --> 01:31:11.693]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:31:11.753 --> 01:31:12.493]  They're very common.
[01:31:12.573 --> 01:31:15.756]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:31:15.796 --> 01:31:16.076]  price.
[01:31:16.316 --> 01:31:17.477]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[01:31:17.497 --> 01:31:19.919]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:31:20.139 --> 01:31:23.941]  Tamoxifen you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:31:23.982 --> 01:31:24.262]  price.
[01:31:24.622 --> 01:31:27.004]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[01:31:27.284 --> 01:31:29.285]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:31:29.325 --> 01:31:31.347]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[01:31:31.607 --> 01:31:36.511]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.732]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[01:31:38.752 --> 01:31:39.172]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[01:31:39.192 --> 01:31:40.453]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[01:31:58.633 --> 01:32:00.557]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.038 --> 01:32:03.903]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.826 --> 01:32:09.934]  We're all being conditioned to just accept increased tyranny daily.
[01:32:15.194 --> 01:32:17.256]  Your calls are coming up that I want to get into.
[01:32:17.436 --> 01:32:21.519]  Opposition wants to be smeared with terror attack, says officials.
[01:32:21.659 --> 01:32:29.585]  London Independent, the government was going to carry out terror attacks in Ukraine to blame it on their enemies and now they're still planning it.
[01:32:30.326 --> 01:32:32.407]  This is all over mainstream news in Europe.
[01:32:33.188 --> 01:32:40.874]  Well, why would the government want to blow something up to then rally the people around the government to say, oh look, we're under attack.
[01:32:40.914 --> 01:32:42.255]  It's real simple psychology.
[01:32:43.917 --> 01:32:49.479]  It's like somebody beating themselves up and then going to the cops and saying, that person beat me.
[01:32:49.740 --> 01:32:50.520]  That's pretty common.
[01:32:50.540 --> 01:32:51.060]  Did you know that?
[01:32:53.381 --> 01:32:55.022]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:32:55.222 --> 01:32:56.002]  Frame-ups.
[01:32:56.743 --> 01:33:00.624]  It's government's favorite trick to get things done that are unpopular.
[01:33:01.485 --> 01:33:06.587]  Whether it was Nero or Hitler or our own government, they do it over and over again.
[01:33:06.607 --> 01:33:09.548]  So that's coming up, plus a bunch of financial news.
[01:33:09.568 --> 01:33:11.769]  There's so much of it, but I promise we'll get to your calls in a second.
[01:33:12.209 --> 01:33:13.230]  Before I go any further,
[01:33:14.232 --> 01:33:15.953]  PrisonPlanet.TV!
[01:33:17.033 --> 01:33:32.982]  If you've got friends and family and you haven't gotten them a gift yet and you're going to go out and waste your money on a fruitcake or a tie or a sweater or a cologne, why not spend $5.95 and give them a month subscription to PrisonPlanet.TV.

[01:34:13.894 --> 01:34:15.755]  Get a week for the price of a cup of coffee.
[01:34:18.276 --> 01:34:24.199]  And, uh, you know, give yourself a passcode and name and then go ahead and I'll let you give it to one friend or family member.
[01:34:24.899 --> 01:34:26.160]  Give that as a gift as well.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:32.202]  Or give somebody something they'll really like, a DVD or VHS copy of any of my eleven films.
[01:34:32.222 --> 01:34:33.143]  They're all excellent.
[01:34:33.163 --> 01:34:40.266]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, American Dictator is my newest film.
[01:34:41.155 --> 01:34:51.319]  I've got discounts going right now, where with select films, if you buy one copy at regular price, whether it's $19.95 or $24.95, depending on how long the film is, each additional is $5.95.
[01:34:51.479 --> 01:35:09.446]  I've got a 9-11 inside job special, where you get my two 9-11 films, over five hours of footage, and George Humphrey's 9-11 film, 9-11 The Great Illusion, The Great Deception, and then
[01:35:10.754 --> 01:35:24.500]  You also get Eric Huffman's 9-11-DVD or VHS and Paul Watson's, a hard copy of Paul Watson's 320-something page, Ordered Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsor, Terror, and the New World Order for $59.95.
[01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.101]  That's a $53 discount.
[01:35:26.361 --> 01:35:27.702]  Let's say you already own some of those.
[01:35:28.182 --> 01:35:29.403]  Get the package deal.
[01:35:29.483 --> 01:35:30.343]  Give them as gifts.
[01:35:31.363 --> 01:35:33.344]  And UPF takes three or four days to get there.
[01:35:33.364 --> 01:35:36.726]  It takes a day or two to process your order and three days to ship it to you.
[01:35:37.452 --> 01:35:40.434]  The mail's pretty slow if you've got a P.O.
[01:35:40.474 --> 01:35:42.695]  Box or if you want it to go U.S.P.S.
[01:35:42.715 --> 01:35:45.997]  You better order now, folks, to get these in time to give us gifts.
[01:35:46.937 --> 01:35:48.258]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:48.278 --> 01:35:49.158]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:36:18.444 --> 01:36:27.408]  Give us the name and address, and we will mail them whatever you order.
[01:36:29.348 --> 01:36:30.549]  So again, you can do that.
[01:36:30.909 --> 01:36:33.230]  And then just send them a card saying, hey, this is coming in the mail to you.
[01:36:34.196 --> 01:36:39.861]  And give them 9-11-The-Road-To-Tyranny, or Police State 3 Total Enslavement, or any of the other books and videos I carry.
[01:36:41.703 --> 01:36:43.064]  So you can do that, folks.
[01:36:43.084 --> 01:36:45.766]  You can actually, on the website, put it into the comments section.
[01:36:46.607 --> 01:36:52.472]  As well, if you order at InfoWars.com, you can put in the comments section where you want it mailed, if it's a gift.
[01:36:53.353 --> 01:36:56.456]  Just please tell them you're sending it to them, and they'll open it up and go, what is this?
[01:36:57.457 --> 01:36:58.537]  So here is the
[01:36:59.873 --> 01:37:07.855]  And yes, your order of the films makes this broadcast possible, and the website's possible, and it also supports what we're doing.
[01:37:07.915 --> 01:37:10.795]  And if you haven't gotten my films yourself, get them!
[01:37:10.835 --> 01:37:11.795]  Make copies of them!
[01:37:11.815 --> 01:37:12.935]  Give them to people!
[01:37:26.792 --> 01:37:28.813]  You don't have to buy a bunch of copies to give copies.
[01:37:29.373 --> 01:37:30.794]  Though people like getting an original.
[01:37:31.674 --> 01:37:34.836]  You know, with the shrink wrap, the color cover, and the stamp on the top and all that.
[01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:37.337]  But get one copy and make a hundred copies.
[01:37:37.397 --> 01:37:38.538]  I just want to get the word out.
[01:37:38.878 --> 01:37:39.678]  That's all I want.
[01:37:40.659 --> 01:37:46.702]  So again, you can order at InfoWars.com or 1-888-253-3139.
[01:37:47.022 --> 01:37:48.122]  Please don't procrastinate.
[01:37:48.503 --> 01:37:53.145]  And then last but not least, I never really promote this, Prison Planet
[01:37:55.289 --> 01:37:56.070]  .tv is great.
[01:37:56.111 --> 01:37:57.352]  Infowars.com is great.
[01:37:57.372 --> 01:37:58.234]  All the sites are great.
[01:37:58.534 --> 01:38:00.918]  But Infowars.net is really wonderful.
[01:38:00.938 --> 01:38:02.881]  And we have our own separate webmaster there.
[01:38:03.221 --> 01:38:06.766]  A lot of different news you'll see there than what you see on Infowars and Prison Planet.
[01:38:07.568 --> 01:38:10.312]  But there's also internet service provided by RovinNet.
[01:38:10.894 --> 01:38:16.757]  High-speed dial-up, the hyper-dial-up, virtual browsers so nobody knows who you are while you're out on the web.
[01:38:16.777 --> 01:38:19.639]  If it's a cloaking device, you have your anonymity.
[01:38:20.659 --> 01:38:27.423]  For cheaper, then you'll pay with some big service that spies on you and sells your name and sells your web habits.
[01:38:27.503 --> 01:38:28.263]  We don't do that!
[01:38:29.464 --> 01:38:33.426]  Dial-up nationwide, the hyper-dial-up, and you'll save money.
[01:38:33.486 --> 01:38:34.387]  We have DSL.
[01:38:35.596 --> 01:38:38.359]  All of it at Infowars.net.
[01:38:38.459 --> 01:38:40.820]  It's also a news site, but just go check it out.
[01:38:42.061 --> 01:38:46.525]  Alright, let's go back to the calls and I'll plunge into all this news.
[01:38:47.746 --> 01:38:48.987]  I sound a little bit out of it today.
[01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:50.868]  Again, I'm running a fever and got a little bit of a cold.
[01:38:50.909 --> 01:38:52.330]  It's going around right now.
[01:38:53.370 --> 01:38:56.933]  Let's go ahead and I guess up next is Scott in Texas.
[01:38:56.993 --> 01:38:57.954]  Scott, thanks for holding.
[01:38:58.354 --> 01:38:59.135]  Yeah, sure Alex.
[01:38:59.195 --> 01:38:59.836]  Thanks a lot.
[01:39:00.902 --> 01:39:03.704]  Yeah, I had basically two questions.
[01:39:03.844 --> 01:39:05.425]  I'm a subscriber first.
[01:39:05.505 --> 01:39:10.528]  I'm a subscriber to Prison Planet TV.
[01:39:10.648 --> 01:39:16.732]  Anyway, I was just wondering if you guys were going to post last Thursday and Friday's broadcast
[01:39:18.084 --> 01:39:21.725]  on the audio link, you know, for download.
[01:39:21.805 --> 01:39:27.087]  Yes, we post a lot of the good interviews and those are certainly two interviews that need to be put up there.
[01:39:27.367 --> 01:39:27.827]  Yeah.
[01:39:27.847 --> 01:39:30.448]  They were four different interviews and I'll make sure those get posted.
[01:39:30.488 --> 01:39:31.789]  Those were fantastic.
[01:39:31.889 --> 01:39:34.750]  I mean, you know, they just, so much info packed in there.
[01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:46.854]  My next question was relating to Gulf War illness and, you know, you hear a lot, you heard a lot about it in Gulf War I, which I am a veteran,
[01:39:47.632 --> 01:39:52.657]  Of, and then it seems to be it's not really being reported that much.
[01:39:52.697 --> 01:40:08.912]  I know you hit on it from time to time, depleted uranium, but when I first started coming down with symptoms of it, through some different research, I found a Dr. Gary Nichols, who was then, this was back in the mid-90s.
[01:40:09.012 --> 01:40:12.235]  Yeah, Garth and Kathy Nichols.
[01:40:12.535 --> 01:40:13.316]  Yeah, Garth, yeah.
[01:40:13.943 --> 01:40:18.767]  And, uh, boy, that's a scandal and a whole book right there.
[01:40:18.867 --> 01:40:23.050]  Well, he was one of the top scientists at MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility.
[01:40:24.251 --> 01:40:27.454]  And they felt bio-weapons, you name it, in the troops.
[01:40:27.894 --> 01:40:30.776]  And the DU's heavy metal on top of the radiation.
[01:40:31.217 --> 01:40:34.019]  And the Army's own handbook says it's deadly.
[01:40:34.399 --> 01:40:37.842]  And then they have our troops march in and live in barracks that have been bombed with it.
[01:40:38.102 --> 01:40:38.382]  Right.
[01:40:38.582 --> 01:40:40.744]  And then... It's like saying, you know, basically,
[01:40:41.759 --> 01:40:44.580]  You know, march off the edge of a cliff!
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:45.160]  Right.
[01:40:45.560 --> 01:40:56.824]  And then Dr. Nichols, just being a good person and a good American, and I think one of his family members came down with it, he was wanting to get to the root of what was wrong with her because everybody was misdiagnosing her.
[01:40:57.324 --> 01:41:10.209]  He goes to all this trouble, finds out that he has to do some advanced lab work, which ultimately turns into gene tracking, which relatively few scientists can do.
[01:41:10.896 --> 01:41:13.577]  Because it was a genetically engineered bioweapon.
[01:41:13.777 --> 01:41:25.482]  Right, and so anyway, you know, and then you've got him really thinking he's doing something good for the country, which he was, and then come to find out they fire him, and tell him he's got to get out of there.
[01:41:25.502 --> 01:41:35.965]  Well, it's like a few weeks ago, one of the head guys at the group that certified the steel at the World Trade Center said, we've done our own internal studies, steel doesn't melt at these temperatures, it's a fraud, and they fire him.
[01:41:36.526 --> 01:41:37.246]  Right, right.
[01:41:37.938 --> 01:41:40.460]  And this is the, you know, this is the American way.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:45.623]  I mean, it's the same thing as Agent Orange and, you know, that whole scandal in Vietnam.
[01:41:45.763 --> 01:41:46.143]  Excuse me.
[01:41:46.483 --> 01:41:54.088]  But anyway, yeah, so do you think, I was just wanting to say, I was thinking that would be a really, you know, interesting interview.
[01:41:54.869 --> 01:41:58.211]  You know, I've had Garth Nichols on before, six years ago.
[01:41:58.231 --> 01:41:58.991]  I need to have him back on.
[01:41:59.031 --> 01:41:59.652]  Thanks for the call.
[01:41:59.792 --> 01:42:00.252]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:42:00.592 --> 01:42:01.413]  I appreciate you.
[01:42:02.093 --> 01:42:06.276]  Speaking of drugs and things, you know, they admit Vioxx makes your heart disintegrate, basically.
[01:42:07.427 --> 01:42:09.088]  Now, five other drugs have been pulled.
[01:42:10.369 --> 01:42:13.311]  Well, they know Ritalin and Prozac are killing children en masse.
[01:42:13.391 --> 01:42:13.991]  Far worse.
[01:42:14.011 --> 01:42:17.414]  I mean, bad for hearts, brains, psychology, everything.
[01:42:17.994 --> 01:42:18.935]  They don't stop that.
[01:42:20.356 --> 01:42:23.037]  Drugmaker Rebuff called to monitor users.
[01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:23.898]  Lawsuits say
[01:42:24.819 --> 01:42:28.402]  Accutane caused birth defects, depression and deaths.
[01:42:29.002 --> 01:42:31.564]  So now all this stuff's coming out with different drugs.
[01:42:31.884 --> 01:42:33.965]  I think they're allowing this out strategically.
[01:42:34.005 --> 01:42:36.027]  I've noticed it's key drug companies being attacked.
[01:42:36.347 --> 01:42:39.389]  I think this is economic warfare by one global group against another.
[01:42:40.029 --> 01:42:42.091]  Bottom line, most of these drugs are deadly, folks.
[01:42:42.111 --> 01:42:42.891]  They're toxins.
[01:42:43.812 --> 01:42:46.554]  They're not natural.
[01:42:47.374 --> 01:42:49.496]  So just another thing that they told you was great.
[01:42:50.196 --> 01:42:53.158]  But the same media will tell you that mercury is good for your brain.
[01:42:53.718 --> 01:42:54.499]  Good for your children.
[01:42:55.598 --> 01:42:57.439]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:00.261]  Thanks for the call, Scott.
[01:43:00.821 --> 01:43:01.341]  Good points.
[01:43:01.401 --> 01:43:02.562]  I'll try to get him back on.
[01:43:03.162 --> 01:43:04.503]  Darren in Colorado.
[01:43:04.563 --> 01:43:04.923]  Welcome.
[01:43:05.484 --> 01:43:06.084]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:43:06.164 --> 01:43:08.385]  It's a real privilege to be with you today.
[01:43:08.445 --> 01:43:08.805]  Good day to you.
[01:43:08.825 --> 01:43:09.906]  No, it's a privilege to talk to you.
[01:43:09.946 --> 01:43:10.366]  Go ahead.
[01:43:11.647 --> 01:43:17.650]  I just want people to know that these men that served in World War II, they're from a whole different generation.
[01:43:17.690 --> 01:43:18.531]  They're good men.
[01:43:18.551 --> 01:43:19.511]  They're principled men.
[01:43:19.551 --> 01:43:23.473]  My grandpa was a World War II veteran, and he died last year.
[01:43:25.011 --> 01:43:29.593]  You know, when he was 20 years old, he was laying bleeding on the beaches of Normandy.
[01:43:30.354 --> 01:43:32.335]  Purple heart, two bronze stars.
[01:43:32.395 --> 01:43:35.977]  I mean, these men have paid their dues.
[01:43:36.017 --> 01:43:37.237]  These men are from another era.
[01:43:37.417 --> 01:43:45.882]  I mean, my grandpa had to park way far away from a football game one time and had to walk way clear out to his car when it was over with.
[01:43:46.542 --> 01:43:52.285]  There's two young fellas leaning against the door, and they wouldn't move when he approached the door to get in.
[01:43:52.325 --> 01:43:54.106]  And he said, look, he said,
[01:43:55.057 --> 01:43:57.879]  One of you might get me, but I'm taking one of you with me.
[01:43:58.099 --> 01:43:59.039]  And they walked away.
[01:43:59.059 --> 01:44:17.750]  In regards to this incident with the shooting, I had a friend of mine, his sister was home alone, and a man she had only met one time came pounding belligerents, screaming belligerents, pounding on the door, foaming at the mouth, a big man,
[01:44:18.456 --> 01:44:21.617]  She'd only met him once through some other people and didn't know why he was there.
[01:44:21.657 --> 01:44:23.638]  She told him not to come in, go away.
[01:44:24.158 --> 01:44:25.679]  He ripped the door off the hinges.
[01:44:26.199 --> 01:44:27.339]  He went through two doors.
[01:44:27.419 --> 01:44:32.041]  And by the time he did that, I'd be in a prone position aimed straight at his chest.
[01:44:33.183 --> 01:44:36.024]  And I'd fire to the chest four times and put a couple into the head.
[01:44:36.184 --> 01:44:37.485]  Well, now this is a big man.
[01:44:37.525 --> 01:44:38.685]  He's foaming at the mouth.
[01:44:38.745 --> 01:44:40.406]  He's screaming belligerence.
[01:44:40.546 --> 01:44:42.026]  And of course these women don't have guns.
[01:44:42.386 --> 01:44:43.107]  She had a gun.
[01:44:43.147 --> 01:44:43.547]  Good!
[01:44:43.827 --> 01:44:44.067]  Good.
[01:44:44.127 --> 01:44:44.847]  Most women don't.
[01:44:44.887 --> 01:44:45.508]  They need a gun.
[01:44:45.668 --> 01:44:46.988]  She had a .22 pistol.
[01:44:47.168 --> 01:44:48.809]  She had plenty of time to get it ready.
[01:44:48.969 --> 01:44:52.810]  When he finally got through that second door, she put six slugs in him.
[01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:54.371]  And all it did was make him mad.
[01:44:55.140 --> 01:44:56.201]  All it did was make him mad.
[01:44:56.241 --> 01:44:57.061]  That's why you need a .357.
[01:44:57.101 --> 01:45:07.586]  The reason I say a .357 is, it's a simple gun, it's not going to jam on you, and you've got six shots, and if you're half-decent with it, you're not going to miss.
[01:45:08.626 --> 01:45:17.970]  And the round is at close range, is semi-high velocity, causes massive, massive damage.
[01:45:18.450 --> 01:45:21.772]  You shoot somebody a couple times in the chest with that, they're not going to be living very long.
[01:45:21.892 --> 01:45:28.978]  You know, she ran into the bedroom and locked herself in there, and he ripped that door off the hinges with six slugs in his torso.
[01:45:29.559 --> 01:45:33.622]  He was just fired up, and she reloaded.
[01:45:34.023 --> 01:45:35.684]  He was probably on steroids.
[01:45:36.285 --> 01:45:37.166]  He was on something.
[01:45:37.406 --> 01:45:39.348]  That later came out that he was on something.
[01:45:39.828 --> 01:45:44.552]  But he ripped that door free from the frame, and she let six more slugs fly.
[01:45:44.973 --> 01:45:46.614]  And he finally did go down.
[01:45:47.375 --> 01:45:48.756]  And he finally did die.
[01:45:49.744 --> 01:45:52.126]  But they interrogated her for hours!
[01:45:52.767 --> 01:45:58.491]  They didn't let her sleep, they took her in, confiscated her gun, and treated her like some kind of...
[01:45:59.432 --> 01:46:00.013]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:46:00.113 --> 01:46:00.833]  Federal criminals.
[01:46:00.853 --> 01:46:06.898]  That's because the government wants a monopoly on force and defense, so we beg for more and more surveillance and control.
[01:46:06.958 --> 01:46:09.120]  They hate it when we defend ourselves.
[01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:11.282]  Now, not the average cop, though that's starting to change.
[01:46:11.302 --> 01:46:12.683]  A lot of them don't like it now as well.
[01:46:13.264 --> 01:46:13.584]  Used to be 90%.
[01:46:14.104 --> 01:46:15.426]  Now we're losing that number.
[01:46:15.446 --> 01:46:18.488]  Going down to about 80% in major polls believe you should be able to defend yourself.
[01:46:18.808 --> 01:46:24.053]  But the head cops, the ones that get the federal money, they can't stand it when we defend ourselves.
[01:46:24.533 --> 01:46:26.215]  My grandpa, a World War II veteran,
[01:46:27.065 --> 01:46:29.987]  You know, he would not have curled up in a fetal position.
[01:46:30.027 --> 01:46:41.676]  If you came into his house and threatened him with bodily harm, he would not have crawled under his bed or looked for a phone so he could call somebody to do his dirty work for him.
[01:46:41.716 --> 01:46:45.640]  He would have rose up and stood up for his own well-being.
[01:46:46.847 --> 01:46:49.729]  He wouldn't have cried out for somebody else to do it for him.
[01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:52.850]  No, I hear you, Darren, and God bless you.
[01:46:53.190 --> 01:46:57.393]  And in just a few years, all these vets are going to be gone.
[01:46:58.673 --> 01:47:00.594]  We have a new documentary about them.
[01:47:01.175 --> 01:47:05.657]  Just to interview the old folks, because they remember when Roosevelt took all the gold and gave his paper money back.
[01:47:05.697 --> 01:47:06.277]  It was amazing.
[01:47:06.297 --> 01:47:07.098]  Thanks for the call, Darren.
[01:47:08.999 --> 01:47:15.102]  That's a really good point that he raises, but a lot of women and families don't own guns because they've never touched them.
[01:47:16.354 --> 01:47:18.054]  And they're scared to death of them because of the media.
[01:47:18.074 --> 01:47:18.755]  They don't understand.
[01:47:18.795 --> 01:47:30.517]  They can go take a couple gun lessons, shoot the firearms, learn how safe they are, have an instant access pistol safe, bolted, say, inside a cabinet, with an access code.
[01:47:30.557 --> 01:47:36.578]  You can get in about a second and a half, but your child could sit there for five hours, punching buttons, and is never going to get in.
[01:47:38.599 --> 01:47:41.560]  And then you have that, and that's what I've got in my house.
[01:47:41.620 --> 01:47:43.580]  I've got two instant access pistol safes.
[01:47:44.606 --> 01:47:48.649]  And anybody ever comes in my house, I mean, they're dead!
[01:47:49.449 --> 01:47:53.031]  You bust in my house and say I'm gonna get you, well I'm gonna get you!
[01:47:53.592 --> 01:47:55.113]  And that's just common sense, folks!
[01:47:55.293 --> 01:47:58.855]  Any mammal out there will defend itself in its own nest.
[01:48:00.216 --> 01:48:07.280]  Only Americans, only people in China and Russia, enslaved creatures, have had that driven out of their instincts.
[01:48:08.522 --> 01:48:09.443]  Good points, Darren.
[01:48:09.883 --> 01:48:11.004]  Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:48:11.044 --> 01:48:11.765]  Roger, go ahead.
[01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:13.046]  Yeah, thanks Alex.
[01:48:13.086 --> 01:48:23.214]  I guess there's a pretty good chance that Leonard has knowledge and experience way beyond nostalgia to bring him back on the Flying Tigers, General Chennault, etc.
[01:48:23.775 --> 01:48:31.141]  And I haven't heard actually in years, and it wasn't explicitly stated, it needs to be because you have a lot of new listeners and such.
[01:48:31.989 --> 01:48:46.112]  But, unfortunately, unless you live in one of the probably all-too-few locales or states that forbid tortious lawsuits from criminals, then they really strip you of the discretion if you're going to shoot.
[01:48:46.312 --> 01:48:48.673]  You really have to kill the person, unfortunately.
[01:48:48.773 --> 01:48:50.233]  I've had a lot of police tell me that.
[01:48:50.694 --> 01:48:57.015]  You really have to kill the person, or else... I mean, what if Leonard wants to keep his house, etc.?
[01:48:57.615 --> 01:49:00.556]  It might have been foolhardy not to kill the guy, unfortunately.
[01:49:03.013 --> 01:49:03.713]  Well, I know this.
[01:49:03.773 --> 01:49:09.255]  I mean, he fist fought the guy, then gets his gun and tells the guy to leave.
[01:49:09.295 --> 01:49:09.855]  He doesn't leave.
[01:49:09.895 --> 01:49:10.896]  He shoots at his feet.
[01:49:11.716 --> 01:49:12.496]  I mean, boy!
[01:49:12.516 --> 01:49:16.838]  I mean, what if the guy would have wrestled the gun away from him, Roger?
[01:49:17.578 --> 01:49:18.619]  Yeah, well, that too.
[01:49:18.659 --> 01:49:28.262]  But, you know, there could be a situation where you may know that it's safe not to kill the person, but you still have to kill them, unfortunately, to avoid the tortious lawsuit.
[01:49:29.389 --> 01:49:29.989]  God bless y'all.
[01:49:30.329 --> 01:49:30.650]  Thanks.
[01:49:31.290 --> 01:49:32.911]  And look, I'm not bloodthirsty.
[01:49:32.931 --> 01:49:36.272]  If I saw somebody out stealing my car, the car ain't worth it.
[01:49:37.072 --> 01:49:38.093]  I wouldn't even go out there.
[01:49:38.133 --> 01:49:39.814]  I'd just call the police and let them steal the car.
[01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:44.976]  But you come in my house, I am going to kill you.
[01:49:45.836 --> 01:49:46.817]  It's common sense.
[01:49:47.537 --> 01:49:48.197]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:48.597 --> 01:49:49.138]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:49:53.812 --> 01:50:00.639]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.959 --> 01:50:02.341]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.541 --> 01:50:04.763]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.883 --> 01:50:06.985]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.266 --> 01:50:12.190]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.531 --> 01:50:16.555]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.795 --> 01:50:18.577]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.657 --> 01:50:29.307]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.467 --> 01:50:31.369]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.569 --> 01:50:35.453]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:50:35.533 --> 01:50:36.794]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:50:40.518 --> 01:50:41.380]  That's 888-2533139.
[01:50:41.680 --> 01:50:47.631]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:50:47.892 --> 01:50:48.573]  Again, that number, 888-2533139.
[01:50:53.337 --> 01:50:58.559]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.699 --> 01:51:06.782]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.042 --> 01:51:14.104]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.284 --> 01:51:15.565]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.645 --> 01:51:21.549]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.729 --> 01:51:26.813]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.933 --> 01:51:35.799]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.079 --> 01:51:39.362]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:56.225 --> 01:53:02.246]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.666 --> 01:53:05.807]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.967 --> 01:53:13.749]  Opposition wants to be smeared with terror attacks as official London Independent.
[01:53:14.469 --> 01:53:22.891]  Ukraine's embattled government is ready to stage fake terror attacks to destabilize the country and distract the opposition
[01:53:24.076 --> 01:53:32.042]  Ahead of a return of the presidential vote, a senior government source has told The Independent, discredit the opposition.
[01:53:32.582 --> 01:53:48.414]  The official who works for the government of the Moscow-backed candidate said current Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych said one of the plans is to blow up a pipeline and blame it on the opposition supporters.
[01:53:48.995 --> 01:53:53.378]  Ukraine is the key transit country for Russian gas supplies to the West.
[01:53:54.497 --> 01:54:10.152]  And it says that Mr. Yankovich's backers fear the prospect of their candidate losing to Viktor Yuskovov and are ready to plunge the country into economic chaos, the source revealed.
[01:54:10.953 --> 01:54:14.176]  They are planning to use criminals, plain bandits,
[01:54:14.975 --> 01:54:17.017]  That they have a holdover.
[01:54:17.037 --> 01:54:22.501]  The source said that a senior member of the government had been tasked with overseeing the terror attacks.
[01:54:23.121 --> 01:54:25.283]  Again, this is exactly what Putin's been caught doing.
[01:54:25.823 --> 01:54:28.965]  In a fourth apartment building in 1999 to blame it on foreign enemies.
[01:54:29.325 --> 01:54:38.972]  Moscow police were staking out apartment buildings and actually caught FSB planting bombs, caught them with the hydrogen bombs, putting them on the columns.
[01:54:40.033 --> 01:54:41.094]  Putin ordered them released.
[01:54:42.081 --> 01:54:43.824]  The rest is history.
[01:54:44.244 --> 01:54:48.733]  A fortnight of peaceful demonstrations by supporters of
[01:54:50.405 --> 01:54:55.490]  Yushchenko have brought the capital Kiev and other cities to a standstill.
[01:54:55.530 --> 01:55:01.396]  They accused the government of massive electoral fraud in a presidential election on the 21st of November.
[01:55:01.716 --> 01:55:11.646]  The opposition claims were backed up by Western governments and the election monitors who reported that intimidation, bribery, and falsification were used to hand victory to him.
[01:55:12.046 --> 01:55:13.668]  By the way, we now have articles
[01:55:14.798 --> 01:55:21.304]  Where computer programmers have gone public and said, I was ordered by the Republicans in Florida to create a vote fraud system.
[01:55:21.444 --> 01:55:27.810]  I was ordered... I mean, there's just masses of these reports coming out here, but you never really hear the details of it on the nightly news.
[01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:29.692]  It's in a newspaper here, a newspaper there.
[01:55:31.173 --> 01:55:39.541]  Ukraine's Supreme Court accepted opposition claims last Friday, and cancelled the results of the election, ordering a fresh ballot for the 26th of December.
[01:55:42.375 --> 01:55:50.361]  There has already been a run on banks and a black market money changers are returning to the streets with far higher dollar and euro exchange rates.
[01:55:53.203 --> 01:56:01.429]  The government has already suggested that it will not be able to pay pensions and government salaries in December, although the opposition claims there are adequate reserves to pay everything.
[01:56:03.731 --> 01:56:09.015]  Before the election, members of the police said that they were being ordered to carry out bombings to blame it on opposition.
[01:56:11.258 --> 01:56:15.039]  See, what does the establishment do when their own people start blowing the whistle?
[01:56:15.479 --> 01:56:18.941]  And next hour, I'll get into the articles here in the U.S.
[01:56:19.081 --> 01:56:25.543]  where people are blowing the whistle saying, look, we've been ordered to carry out frauds in Florida, Ohio, and other states.
[01:56:25.983 --> 01:56:29.764]  Clearly those frauds took place, but notice Kerry isn't talking about it.
[01:56:29.804 --> 01:56:32.885]  Kerry isn't disputing because it was rigged at that level as well.
[01:56:34.026 --> 01:56:38.387]  See, if you're going to rig the election, you've got to have the candidates rigged as well, or one of them might dispute it.
[01:56:39.312 --> 01:56:41.333]  Again, we're not saying Kerry's going to save you.
[01:56:41.593 --> 01:56:43.674]  We're just reporting the clear facts here.
[01:56:45.655 --> 01:56:47.015]  Let's take a call.
[01:56:48.216 --> 01:56:49.016]  Well, we've got a break.
[01:56:49.376 --> 01:56:54.198]  We'll end this hour and then we'll go back to Steve and Manuel and many others that are holding.
[01:56:54.578 --> 01:56:56.519]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:56:56.539 --> 01:56:56.599]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:57:06.638 --> 01:57:08.199]  And again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:57:08.259 --> 01:57:22.927]  Your call's a ton of news, including the plunging dollar, ex-Dazi spy chief Marcus Wolfe hired by Homeland Security, new developments there, OPEC nation seen cutting worldwide deposits in dollars.
[01:57:24.948 --> 01:57:28.650]  Big news coming up in the third hour.
[01:57:28.710 --> 01:57:29.871]  You do not want to miss it.
[01:57:31.835 --> 01:57:36.219]  And remember, as we accelerate into the new year, be sure and give people the gift of information.
[01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:39.783]  Give them a membership to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:39.843 --> 01:57:41.144]  Stay with us.
[01:57:41.204 --> 01:57:41.605]  Big Brother.
[01:57:41.645 --> 01:57:42.185]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.055 --> 01:57:58.499]  Monday through Friday, from eleven to two central, back from nine to midnight, we're here live.
[01:57:58.519 --> 01:58:00.221]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:00.301 --> 01:58:02.062]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:58:19.185 --> 01:58:32.766]  In the first hour into the second hour, we had 87-year-old World War II vet, one of the commanders of the Flying Tigers, in China for 20 months, Leonard Gamage.
[01:58:32.886 --> 01:58:34.208]  He was attacked at his home.
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:41.462]  Fisk fought the guy for over 10 minutes, then got to his gun and shot the person in the foot because he didn't want to kill him.
[01:58:41.862 --> 01:58:46.283]  The police came and confiscated his guns and now the punk has gotten a lawyer to sue the old man.
[01:58:46.863 --> 01:58:51.364]  But an 87-year-old man beat this 20-year-old punk up.
[01:58:53.925 --> 01:58:57.486]  So that's a very interesting story there.
[01:58:57.786 --> 01:59:00.266]  More on that coming up.
[01:59:00.586 --> 01:59:02.627]  There's so much other news here.
[01:59:03.502 --> 01:59:07.203]  Extasi chief says Marcus Wolfe hired by Homeland Security.
[01:59:09.184 --> 01:59:12.505]  Again, Extasi spy chief says Marcus Wolfe hired by Homeland Security.
[01:59:13.545 --> 01:59:16.586]  Iranians think Al Jazeera is a psyops operation.
[01:59:16.686 --> 01:59:19.267]  US dollar plunges even further.
[01:59:19.287 --> 01:59:25.569]  That's just some of the news that we're going to be covering in this hour.
[01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:29.550]  Remember that NFL football player that got killed in Afghanistan?
[01:59:30.461 --> 01:59:33.742]  Turns out he was killed by a friendly fire in the media and the government.
[01:59:34.502 --> 01:59:39.623]  Consciously created a false story for propaganda purposes just like Private Lynch.
[01:59:39.723 --> 01:59:41.444]  He told you it was a quote, fable.
[01:59:42.384 --> 01:59:43.024]  Made up.
[01:59:43.324 --> 01:59:44.064]  Not true.
[01:59:45.085 --> 01:59:46.285]  That's your government.
[01:59:47.205 --> 01:59:49.226]  And I'm not belittling the death of this gentleman.
[01:59:49.246 --> 01:59:52.006]  I mean, he certainly gave up a lot in the NFL and went to war.
[01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:55.547]  But I talked about how he was very misguided.
[01:59:56.847 --> 01:59:59.288]  So the globalists could get some poppies and some oil.
[02:00:00.496 --> 02:00:08.039]  When they put the Taliban and Al-Qaeda into control, and then flew them out to safety to begin with, in the middle of the war, that was all documented.
[02:00:08.499 --> 02:00:10.840]  Well, it turns out that was a fake story as well.
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:12.000]  Our own government killed him.
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.861]  A bunch of untrained rangers killed him.
[02:00:17.122 --> 02:00:20.683]  And this is even in the Washington Post now, but it always comes out too little too late.
[02:00:21.763 --> 02:00:23.504]  So it's pretty sad.
[02:00:23.564 --> 02:00:24.624]  We'll cover that as well.
[02:00:25.024 --> 02:00:26.825]  Right now, let's talk to Steve
[02:00:27.822 --> 02:00:30.084]  In Ohio, Steve here on the air, go ahead.
[02:00:30.104 --> 02:00:31.145]  How are you doing, Alex?
[02:00:31.886 --> 02:00:32.247]  Pretty good.
[02:00:32.427 --> 02:00:38.713]  Yeah, Alex, I wanted to say something about the last couple callers talking about, you know, how, like, shooting somebody and protecting yourself.
[02:00:38.853 --> 02:00:45.139]  The system is systematically designed to protect people so that you are at the mercy of the system.
[02:00:45.179 --> 02:00:46.561]  There's no other reason for it.
[02:00:46.901 --> 02:00:49.344]  Because for years, I've been a victim of a crime myself.
[02:00:49.404 --> 02:00:50.605]  I was a victim of a robbery.
[02:00:51.118 --> 02:00:58.482]  And I can honestly tell you that the system is designed to protect those that perpetrate the crimes, not people like that are trying to defend their property.
[02:00:59.563 --> 02:01:04.625]  And it's designed for the system itself to commit crimes against innocent people and feed off of them.
[02:01:05.006 --> 02:01:10.209]  Well yeah, I mean, look at the fact that most police officers have 100 IQs.
[02:01:10.669 --> 02:01:16.292]  I mean, every time I run into a police officer, you can just feel the stupidity emanate from a lot of them.
[02:01:16.312 --> 02:01:18.133]  They're not very intelligent people, so
[02:01:18.533 --> 02:01:24.256]  When they take orders from their superiors, all they're doing is just doing what they're told.
[02:01:24.296 --> 02:01:28.499]  So if they're told, don't harass that methamphetamine biker, they'll not do it.
[02:01:28.519 --> 02:01:32.141]  But then they'll harass an old lady that, oh, we want your DNA.
[02:01:33.202 --> 02:01:34.022]  Well, let me say this.
[02:01:34.062 --> 02:01:36.183]  A lot of police are smart.
[02:01:36.944 --> 02:01:40.066]  The problem is that a lot of cities have unofficial rules.
[02:01:40.186 --> 02:01:41.507]  Some have official rules.
[02:01:43.044 --> 02:01:47.105]  Dozens that I know of, that if you have over 100 IQ, you cannot be hired.
[02:01:47.345 --> 02:01:50.406]  An internal document showed it's because they're too smart.
[02:01:50.766 --> 02:01:52.927]  They'll see what they're part of, and it's true.
[02:01:52.987 --> 02:01:54.968]  They want automatons.
[02:01:55.368 --> 02:02:00.930]  The sad thing about it is that these automatons are the people that are going to be smashing our skulls in.
[02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:02.110]  I mean, I hate to say it, but
[02:02:02.749 --> 02:02:07.635]  Until we can get some police officers with 120 IQs, then I don't know what else to say.
[02:02:07.675 --> 02:02:08.315]  Well, 100 is too high.
[02:02:08.436 --> 02:02:09.176]  They try to find them with 90 IQs.
[02:02:09.196 --> 02:02:09.897]  15 points lower, retarded folks.
[02:02:18.146 --> 02:02:23.589]  Well, yeah, 100 is the average IQ, but it seems that the 100 IQ is what gets... That's what I just said.
[02:02:23.609 --> 02:02:24.069]  Yeah.
[02:02:24.369 --> 02:02:29.351]  And then, but just 15, 20 points lower, you're dealing with somebody who's mildly retarded.
[02:02:29.371 --> 02:02:31.692]  70 is retarded.
[02:02:31.892 --> 02:02:32.052]  Yeah.
[02:02:32.273 --> 02:02:36.574]  By the way, I was going to say also, what do you think about this PSYOP thing with this food scare?
[02:02:36.594 --> 02:02:39.416]  What's going on with this big food scan?
[02:02:39.516 --> 02:02:41.417]  They're saying now that their food's going to be poisoned.
[02:02:41.437 --> 02:02:42.217]  What's going on here?
[02:02:42.557 --> 02:02:44.138]  Well, come back and we'll talk about it.
[02:02:45.609 --> 02:02:49.955]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.135 --> 02:02:54.581]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.722 --> 02:02:59.087]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.128 --> 02:03:00.489]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.411 --> 02:03:02.652]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.186 --> 02:03:16.686]  We're good to go.
[02:03:45.325 --> 02:03:56.055]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:03:56.215 --> 02:04:03.823]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:04.063 --> 02:04:07.206]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:07.466 --> 02:04:13.214]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:04:13.494 --> 02:04:19.662]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[02:04:20.002 --> 02:04:23.927]  The Berkeliot is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:04:23.967 --> 02:04:25.830]  The water level is always visible.
[02:04:26.010 --> 02:04:31.975]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:04:32.195 --> 02:04:36.459]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:45.206 --> 02:04:48.588]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:04:48.828 --> 02:04:49.148]  Why?
[02:04:49.168 --> 02:04:52.109]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:57.132]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[02:05:29.124 --> 02:05:29.444]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[02:05:33.826 --> 02:05:34.287]  Big Brother.
[02:05:34.307 --> 02:05:35.208]  Mainstream Media.
[02:05:53.112 --> 02:05:59.335]  In Iowa, a few weeks ago, Homeland Security came out and arrested a Gulf War I veteran, a doctor,
[02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:20.410]  They said he complained too much.
[02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:22.751]  He didn't threaten anybody, but complaining is illegal.
[02:06:22.811 --> 02:06:26.832]  And it was actually in the newspaper, Quad City Times, so we're arresting him.
[02:06:27.732 --> 02:06:29.752]  They said Homeland Security is over everything.
[02:06:29.872 --> 02:06:31.053]  Infrastructure protection.
[02:06:31.573 --> 02:06:41.635]  When they went out and told the woman with no court order, take those Rubik's Cubes off your shelf, they didn't have an order that the cubes weren't illegal, weren't illegal knockoffs.
[02:06:41.915 --> 02:06:44.495]  The media, AP, called and found out that they were legal.
[02:06:44.996 --> 02:06:46.156]  They just told her, we don't care.
[02:06:46.276 --> 02:06:46.976]  We are the law.
[02:06:47.990 --> 02:06:51.612]  And she said, aren't you dealing with terrorism?
[02:06:51.652 --> 02:06:52.072]  No, no, no.
[02:06:52.092 --> 02:06:55.274]  We're over infrastructure protection, the economy, everything.
[02:06:55.795 --> 02:07:01.018]  And so what Homeland Security is going to do is, through your new national ID card, that they're about to pass, by the way.
[02:07:01.038 --> 02:07:02.158]  It's in session right now.
[02:07:03.639 --> 02:07:09.523]  Through your national ID card, they will index with all these different databases.
[02:07:09.543 --> 02:07:10.944]  It'll be just like when you fly.
[02:07:10.964 --> 02:07:12.264]  You don't know why you're on the list.
[02:07:14.085 --> 02:07:15.326]  Won't be able to have a job.
[02:07:15.346 --> 02:07:16.427]  You'll be under restrictions.
[02:07:17.250 --> 02:07:20.112]  They're going to have checkpoints, hardened checkpoints on the roads.
[02:07:21.974 --> 02:07:25.377]  And they need scares to get this going as the excuse.
[02:07:25.397 --> 02:07:27.559]  So they're telling us terrorists are about to hit the food.
[02:07:28.268 --> 02:07:29.909]  Terrorists are about to hit the trains.
[02:07:30.329 --> 02:07:31.730]  Terrorists are about to hit the buses.
[02:07:32.171 --> 02:07:33.591]  Terrorists are about to hit the bridges.
[02:07:33.972 --> 02:07:40.816]  Terrorists are about to hit any building over three stories, so now you've all got to have ID cards with RFID that scan you before you get in the building.
[02:07:41.236 --> 02:07:49.061]  And by the way, did I mention I'm Rudolph Giuliani, and I happen to manage the company that sells you this system that the government's telling you you've got to have now.
[02:07:50.662 --> 02:07:55.345]  And by the way, I'm Bernard Carrick, and I'm in the company too, and you've got to buy from us.
[02:07:55.445 --> 02:07:56.166]  It's the law.
[02:07:56.266 --> 02:07:56.926]  Buy from me.
[02:07:57.047 --> 02:07:57.687]  I'm the government.
[02:07:58.738 --> 02:08:01.439]  I'm not only Homeland Security Chief, I also own the company!
[02:08:01.459 --> 02:08:02.860]  You know, this is it!
[02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:05.961]  So, Caller, I don't know which specific article you're talking about.
[02:08:05.981 --> 02:08:17.145]  There's lots of fear-mongering going on about how everything's going to be attacked in a minute, but the border's got to stay wide open, but you're going to have a microscope looking at you and your family.
[02:08:18.285 --> 02:08:19.926]  What particularly were you talking about?
[02:08:20.066 --> 02:08:26.168]  On CNN, all day yesterday, they had non- and I tape most of it, non-stop programs on the Food Scare.
[02:08:26.188 --> 02:08:26.868]  They're saying that
[02:08:27.687 --> 02:08:31.110]  That there's this scare that terrorists are going to start poisoning the food.
[02:08:31.471 --> 02:08:37.175]  And I'm asking, why all of a sudden are they bringing this up, unless they're planning something very nasty?
[02:08:37.916 --> 02:08:48.245]  While they're making the announcement that Homeland Security is going to have to pre-screen you if you work in any agricultural job, and along with that comes all the regulation and inspections.
[02:08:48.565 --> 02:08:48.785]  Right.
[02:08:49.065 --> 02:08:51.888]  As if they could ever stop Al-Cieda from doing anything.
[02:08:52.248 --> 02:08:55.190]  Well, I mean, it just seems so opportune that they're doing it now.
[02:08:55.230 --> 02:09:01.595]  But, I mean, do you think that the American people will continue to put up with all this boy-crying wolf?
[02:09:01.675 --> 02:09:03.156]  I mean, this is getting to be insane.
[02:09:04.031 --> 02:09:19.985]  What's going to happen is we're going to start ignoring it and fighting against it, throwing the Patriot Act out of cities and states, then the globalists are going to turn a city into a molten slag heap and go, you're the ones that let this happen, you held us back from saving you, now we're taking all your rights!
[02:09:20.325 --> 02:09:21.566]  Let me ask you one question, Alex.
[02:09:21.666 --> 02:09:23.888]  How would they implement this thing?
[02:09:23.928 --> 02:09:26.290]  When you were on that Please Stay Free video, you were
[02:09:26.530 --> 02:09:27.011]  Well, they said!
[02:09:36.028 --> 02:09:47.512]  Under infrastructure protection, they shift over to the big college degrees, big homeland security, and they hire all these people, and they federalize local police, and everything's a federal terror matter.
[02:09:47.612 --> 02:09:57.975]  Rubik's cubes, veterans complaining, pot dealing, speeding, I've got cases of that, bid rigging, just everything is a terror act.
[02:09:58.035 --> 02:10:01.016]  Correct, and then everybody's in a database to have a job.
[02:10:01.056 --> 02:10:06.699]  You've got to be in good standing with them, and if you swipe the ID card and it says you're bad, you don't get a job.
[02:10:06.799 --> 02:10:09.040]  Okay, hypothetically, let me say this last thing.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:14.802]  What about if people decided to just get off the grid system and live off the land, work for food?
[02:10:14.842 --> 02:10:19.044]  In other words... Well, tens of millions of people have done that, and that's why they're panicking.
[02:10:19.064 --> 02:10:19.384]  Right.
[02:10:19.624 --> 02:10:23.405]  So in other words, let's say I got tired of being taxed to death and I decided I'm just going to drop out.
[02:10:23.666 --> 02:10:27.027]  I'm going to get in my car, work for food and labor, and just live from town to town.
[02:10:27.667 --> 02:10:30.389]  They won't let you drive your car without all the stickers.
[02:10:58.294 --> 02:10:59.395]  It's hard to implement.
[02:10:59.415 --> 02:11:00.535]  They're going to have big problems.
[02:11:00.575 --> 02:11:01.135]  Thanks for the call.
[02:11:01.415 --> 02:11:01.676]  Thank you.
[02:11:02.076 --> 02:11:02.776]  Really good points.
[02:11:02.816 --> 02:11:09.379]  Look, I saw Ridge two and a half years ago for two hours on C-SPAN lay all this out.
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:20.484]  You know, it's like I got up on air and I go, they're going to put transponders in your car and satellite boxes, and when you don't want to do that, they'll go, okay, we'll just read your license plate with cameras and tax you that way.
[02:11:21.084 --> 02:11:21.985]  Now it's going in.
[02:11:22.465 --> 02:11:23.345]  Now they're proposing it.
[02:11:23.625 --> 02:11:24.806]  Some states are starting to do it.
[02:11:26.448 --> 02:11:29.410]  New York's trying, Oregon, California, Texas.
[02:11:30.831 --> 02:11:32.992]  This is happening.
[02:11:33.072 --> 02:11:38.856]  I know it sounded crazy five years ago as I held the document up on TV, as I posted it, as I warned you.
[02:11:39.456 --> 02:11:40.857]  All I do is report the news.
[02:11:41.978 --> 02:11:43.959]  You go, well wait, is the media lying?
[02:11:44.579 --> 02:11:46.561]  No, the truth is in the back of the news wire.
[02:11:47.141 --> 02:11:48.782]  The truth is in the back of the newspaper.
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:52.163]  It's just that you've got to wade through all of it.
[02:11:52.183 --> 02:11:58.310]  The truth is in government press releases and government policy reports and declassified documents.
[02:11:58.330 --> 02:11:59.491]  That's what I read.
[02:11:59.851 --> 02:12:00.792]  That's what I study.
[02:12:02.154 --> 02:12:03.756]  Life is going to be a living hell.
[02:12:04.717 --> 02:12:10.503]  And as the economy gets worse and worse, the only real jobs are going to be in law enforcement and security.
[02:12:11.650 --> 02:12:13.051]  Or in tattletale squads.
[02:12:13.652 --> 02:12:15.433]  Or in manufacturing these systems.
[02:12:15.933 --> 02:12:21.257]  And so the yuppies are all going to do whatever it takes to be in good favor with that, to be part of it.
[02:12:22.862 --> 02:12:32.087]  So see, we're shifting out of the free market into a fascistic slash social system where they socialize our wealth and hand it over to select corporations that become the government.
[02:12:32.427 --> 02:12:38.971]  And the left and right at the grassroots can't figure out this paradigm because they were never taught the real paradigm of mercantilism.
[02:12:39.331 --> 02:12:41.512]  And mercantilism is not free market, folks.
[02:12:42.013 --> 02:12:49.817]  It is the system of economic serfdom within a free trade limited grid within the nobles and their allied syndicates.
[02:12:51.776 --> 02:12:55.698]  I suggest you get an encyclopedia out and research mercantilism.
[02:12:56.058 --> 02:12:58.299]  Then look up feudalism and serfdom.
[02:13:00.339 --> 02:13:04.821]  Then add to that a high-tech overlay and you've got what they're building!
[02:13:07.102 --> 02:13:07.522]  Okay?
[02:13:09.083 --> 02:13:12.644]  And it is really, really bad news.
[02:13:14.945 --> 02:13:17.206]  Let's go ahead and talk to Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[02:13:17.226 --> 02:13:18.087]  Manuel, welcome.
[02:13:18.547 --> 02:13:18.887]  Thank you.
[02:13:20.169 --> 02:13:23.971]  All politics are local, and that is what we all need to understand.
[02:13:24.331 --> 02:13:26.212]  And also, time is of the essence.
[02:13:26.332 --> 02:13:30.533]  We all must become activists now, because tomorrow may be a day too late.
[02:13:31.094 --> 02:13:35.835]  Now, you look at the situation in this town, let me give a warning to everyone out there, maybe new listeners.
[02:13:36.976 --> 02:13:40.357]  Takeover is festering in a town near you, most likely right under your nose.
[02:13:41.238 --> 02:13:43.318]  Here now they want to take over our access channel.
[02:13:44.019 --> 02:13:45.219]  But first, I want to tell you why.
[02:13:45.239 --> 02:13:49.561]  Because we've had this new police commissioner aligned with our mayor, which every time
[02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:52.012]  Either one's name appears in the newspaper.
[02:13:52.372 --> 02:13:53.895]  The other one's name is right behind it.
[02:13:54.516 --> 02:14:01.626]  They've now passed programs such as what they conveniently and cutely called Tax Trespass Affidavit Program.
[02:14:01.946 --> 02:14:06.393]  Where they got folks literally signing their rights away and giving the cops free reign on their property.
[02:14:06.897 --> 02:14:08.959]  And in our own city newsletter put out by the Mailbox.
[02:14:08.979 --> 02:14:11.500]  Well, we have that here in Austin.
[02:14:11.601 --> 02:14:17.465]  If you get arrested for running a red light or not paying parking tickets, we've done reports on this.
[02:14:17.725 --> 02:14:19.707]  It's been on local news.
[02:14:19.727 --> 02:14:20.447]  Let me finish.
[02:14:20.727 --> 02:14:25.471]  They have you sign away all your rights, but now why do they want to get rid of AXS TV?
[02:14:26.351 --> 02:14:27.172]  Oh, check it out.
[02:14:27.352 --> 02:14:32.356]  The Trespass Affidavit program is sort of exactly what you're saying, but a different tilt.
[02:14:32.716 --> 02:14:34.838]  This deals with property owners now.
[02:14:35.458 --> 02:14:36.339]  What they're doing is
[02:14:36.866 --> 02:14:42.551]  Actually telling the people, you're going to give us the names of the tenants that live in your apartment dwelling or your apartment building.
[02:14:43.024 --> 02:15:04.178]  And we'll come in, and we'll, quote, check the hallways of, quote, the specific zone, and that means that once they get a call from their little snitch number, they'll just come kick down your door, and here goes, uh... Well, sir, in Illinois, they have it in some towns where they come into your house, quote, making sure you don't have too many people living there, even if it's your own home, and they don't even have warrants.
[02:15:04.539 --> 02:15:06.460]  You just look up at your bed at 5 a.m.
[02:15:06.500 --> 02:15:07.601]  and there's cops above you,
[02:15:08.317 --> 02:15:10.599]  Now they're doing it in Las Vegas now, everywhere!
[02:15:10.839 --> 02:15:11.780]  That, well, that's here.
[02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:12.820]  That's going on here.
[02:15:12.880 --> 02:15:15.823]  And by the way, that article was laced with military terminology.
[02:15:16.103 --> 02:15:19.065]  And just as Charles said... About how they're going to deal with the civilians?
[02:15:19.325 --> 02:15:19.966]  Oh, check it out!
[02:15:20.386 --> 02:15:24.489]  Our Community Services Coordinator is now the Community Services Commander!
[02:15:25.330 --> 02:15:25.510]  Ah!
[02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:26.611]  And listen to this!
[02:15:26.691 --> 02:15:27.051]  Woo!
[02:15:27.131 --> 02:15:28.192]  Sounds authoritative!
[02:15:28.272 --> 02:15:30.694]  So somebody went on AXS TV and criticized it.
[02:15:30.714 --> 02:15:31.274]  Hey, check it out!
[02:15:31.374 --> 02:15:32.455]  So now they're shutting it down.
[02:15:32.635 --> 02:15:35.738]  I've been writing up letters and I've been trying to pass out to the people.
[02:15:35.778 --> 02:15:37.599]  I typed up a paper warning the people.
[02:15:38.072 --> 02:15:41.033]  Brought out the article that said, hey, you heard the commissioner say, you heard the mayor say it.
[02:15:41.053 --> 02:15:42.174]  They think it's great!
[02:15:42.494 --> 02:15:43.974]  And let me tell you about the Access Channel.
[02:15:44.575 --> 02:15:50.397]  I mean, timing is just, that's why I feel, I literally feel... Yeah, all over the country they're shutting Access TV down, but go ahead and finish up.
[02:15:50.417 --> 02:15:52.518]  Yeah, I hate feeling like the devil wanted, and you know what?
[02:15:53.398 --> 02:15:59.740]  I sat here on my behind, instead of going down to that Access Channel, and when I talked to the former president of our Access Channel, it was too late!
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:00.281]  He was out.
[02:16:00.721 --> 02:16:01.801]  That was gonna be my quick way in.
[02:16:02.361 --> 02:16:03.802]  Or so I thought, well now the government
[02:16:04.218 --> 02:16:07.019]  Rumors abound, and I will be at City Council meeting tonight.
[02:16:07.339 --> 02:16:13.422]  Rumors abound that, in our local newspaper, some fear that the government will take over the Access Channel.
[02:16:13.442 --> 02:16:16.443]  And of course, the Mayor says, absolute nonsense, but guess what?
[02:16:16.503 --> 02:16:17.684]  City Council says they will be...
[02:16:18.422 --> 02:16:18.963]  Accepting public comment.
[02:16:19.003 --> 02:16:21.706]  Well, sir, you just go down and get the rule book and sign up.
[02:16:21.726 --> 02:16:23.027]  They can't keep you from getting on there.
[02:16:23.047 --> 02:16:23.607]  Well, check it out.
[02:16:24.388 --> 02:16:28.713]  Supposedly, according to the mayor, and this is in the same article, he says that's absolute nonsense.
[02:16:29.133 --> 02:16:34.218]  So why in the world would the head of the city council say we're accepting public comment on the issue?
[02:16:34.499 --> 02:16:35.500]  See, it's all a big trick.
[02:16:35.980 --> 02:16:36.240]  I know.
[02:16:36.280 --> 02:16:36.661]  I hear you.
[02:16:36.701 --> 02:16:37.362]  Thanks for the call.
[02:16:38.002 --> 02:16:39.444]  Look, it's the same thing everywhere.
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:42.401]  They're buying up all the radio stations.
[02:16:42.421 --> 02:16:44.341]  They're shutting all the access stations down.
[02:16:44.782 --> 02:16:50.964]  Now, Tenet and the head of CENTCOM and all these people are saying, we're going to start regulating speech on the Internet.
[02:16:51.324 --> 02:16:56.766]  George Bush signed it where we're going to have Internet taxation of 18% starting in 07.
[02:16:57.026 --> 02:17:00.307]  They grandfather it out and then they bill it as saving the Internet.
[02:17:01.608 --> 02:17:04.689]  They're going to have Internet 2 come out and they're going to start shutting down the old web.
[02:17:05.169 --> 02:17:07.590]  They're doing it all because they're losing, folks!
[02:17:07.610 --> 02:17:08.350]  They're panicking!
[02:17:09.682 --> 02:17:11.003]  The people are waking up!
[02:17:12.523 --> 02:17:15.505]  Okay, again, I've done 1,800 interviews.
[02:17:16.505 --> 02:17:18.426]  Almost no one calls in and disagrees with me.
[02:17:19.367 --> 02:17:22.908]  On my own syndicated broadcast, almost no one disagrees with me.
[02:17:25.249 --> 02:17:25.870]  It's happening.
[02:17:28.191 --> 02:17:31.332]  And yes, they're setting up military-style control grids.
[02:17:31.953 --> 02:17:34.494]  They got the National Guard merging with your local police.
[02:17:35.454 --> 02:17:38.716]  They're setting up for oppression because they know they're going to do stuff to you soon.
[02:17:39.508 --> 02:17:40.928]  That you're gonna revolt against!
[02:17:41.688 --> 02:17:44.949]  Things that are so horrible, even couch potatoes are gonna fight!
[02:17:47.210 --> 02:17:54.531]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[02:17:54.891 --> 02:17:59.572]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[02:17:59.792 --> 02:18:03.653]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[02:18:03.893 --> 02:18:06.814]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[02:18:07.134 --> 02:18:14.000]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:22.827]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:18:23.148 --> 02:18:29.453]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[02:18:48.060 --> 02:18:52.642]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:52.962 --> 02:18:55.322]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:18:55.542 --> 02:18:57.083]  Achieve financial independence.

[02:19:47.276 --> 02:19:48.317]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:19:48.638 --> 02:19:51.441]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:51.701 --> 02:19:55.866]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:56.286 --> 02:19:57.127]  So what do you do?
[02:19:57.428 --> 02:20:01.993]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:02.473 --> 02:20:04.615]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:20:05.095 --> 02:20:19.805]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:19.845 --> 02:20:26.910]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:20:45.208 --> 02:20:48.230]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals in the daily diet?
[02:20:48.250 --> 02:20:51.131]  It's not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[02:20:51.351 --> 02:20:58.435]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:20:58.615 --> 02:21:01.917]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:21:02.157 --> 02:21:04.178]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:21:04.519 --> 02:21:12.343]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:21:12.603 --> 02:21:13.904]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:21:14.004 --> 02:21:23.971]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[02:21:35.678 --> 02:21:35.979]  Or visit
[02:21:43.204 --> 02:21:58.755]  Alright, let me run through a bunch of news, and then we'll go to all of the callers that are patiently holding.
[02:22:01.797 --> 02:22:05.260]  Again, you gotta go to PrisonPlanet.com and read this London Independent article.
[02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:10.844]  Opposition was to be smeared with terror attacks, say officials.
[02:22:12.233 --> 02:22:25.598]  Ukraine's embattled government is ready to stage fake terror attacks to destabilize the country and discredit the opposition ahead of the return of the presidential vote a senior government source has told The Independent.
[02:22:26.498 --> 02:22:33.620]  And that's exactly the kind of stuff that Putin has been caught pulling in the past.
[02:22:34.921 --> 02:22:35.741]  Here's another article.
[02:22:36.241 --> 02:22:41.163]  Ex-Dazi spy chief Marcus Wolf hired by Homeland Security.
[02:22:42.142 --> 02:22:48.164]  We've confirmed that they have hired other former KGB chiefs in the past, but this is an all-time low if it's true.
[02:22:48.864 --> 02:22:56.407]  I have no doubt that it's not true, because I've talked to some of the internal sources, and I can't really get much further than that, but it is a congressman.
[02:22:58.127 --> 02:23:04.069]  Now, former East German chief, ex-Dazi spy chief, Marcus Wolff, hired by Homeland Security,
[02:23:04.983 --> 02:23:14.790]  Political analyst Al Martin, who has in the past proven accurate in getting ahead of the news curve, is reporting that Homeland Security has hired former Stasi head, the Silver Fox, Marcus Wolff.
[02:23:15.630 --> 02:23:21.654]  Martin states, Wolff was the man that effectively built the East German state intelligence operation, Internal Directorate.
[02:23:22.074 --> 02:23:25.717]  Martin continues, he turned half the population into informants.
[02:23:26.577 --> 02:23:27.638]  That is his specialty.
[02:23:27.658 --> 02:23:28.779]  It was actually one in ten.
[02:23:29.702 --> 02:23:37.225]  is taking a population, constructing the various state divisions, mechanisms of control, in order to organize informants within the population.
[02:23:38.066 --> 02:23:46.049]  That is his real specialty and he is precisely, as Primakov has intimated, why Wolf is being brought in.
[02:23:46.109 --> 02:23:55.733]  The regime knows that once all of Patriot 2 is lobbed, and they begin working with Patriot 3, they will have then begun to establish the internal mechanism to coordinate
[02:23:56.485 --> 02:23:58.026]  And we'll get to more of this later.
[02:23:58.126 --> 02:24:00.087]  And on top of that, I have articles here
[02:24:26.958 --> 02:24:28.199]  This is out of Newsmax.
[02:24:28.259 --> 02:24:31.820]  Congressional negotiators reach deal on intelligence bill.
[02:24:32.801 --> 02:24:34.381]  Now what's in the intelligence bill?
[02:24:35.582 --> 02:24:44.986]  Patriot Act 2, the parts that haven't passed, the national ID card, the super national ID card, and funding for total information awareness.
[02:24:45.986 --> 02:24:49.128]  Congressional negotiators reach deal on intelligence bill.
[02:24:50.120 --> 02:24:52.461]  I need to get Congressman Paul back on about this.
[02:24:52.841 --> 02:25:03.803]  Congressional negotiators reached a deal Monday with the chief House Republican opponent of legislation revamping the nation's intelligence agencies, clearing the way for a final vote a GOP leader said.
[02:25:04.683 --> 02:25:11.905]  Remember, three weeks ago they passed, or two and a half weeks ago they passed, the New Freedom Initiative.
[02:25:12.105 --> 02:25:13.185]  So this stuff's happening.
[02:25:13.812 --> 02:25:20.554]  The development came as President Bush pressed Congress for swift action, saying the legislation was important for the security of our country.
[02:25:20.974 --> 02:25:24.535]  No, controlling our border is, and controlling the terrorists that work for you.
[02:25:25.295 --> 02:25:38.338]  Representative Deborah Price, Republican Ohio, Chairman of the House Republican Conference, said House Armed Services Chairman Duncan Hunter struck a deal with Senate and House negotiators that will remove his objections to the bill.
[02:25:39.617 --> 02:25:49.224]  House Speaker Dennis Hafter had refused to move the legislation before Thanksgiving because of objections to GOP chairmen such as Hunter and House Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner.
[02:25:50.085 --> 02:25:58.251]  Sensenbrenner rejected and remained opposed to the bill, but House Republicans will likely meet Tuesday to discuss moving forward, Price said.
[02:26:01.954 --> 02:26:04.116]  And they say they're very close to getting it changed.
[02:26:04.156 --> 02:26:06.458]  The Democrats are optimistic with working with Bush.
[02:26:06.478 --> 02:26:08.139]  They just love the police state.
[02:26:09.657 --> 02:26:11.538]  This is so scary.
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:17.041]  And I'm trying to read over the rest of this.
[02:26:17.141 --> 02:26:17.681]  It's lengthy.
[02:26:17.701 --> 02:26:30.608]  We're going to look at the debates over the amount of money not over not having a national ID card or Patriot Act 2, which is the most nightmarish piece of legislation I have ever seen.
[02:26:33.149 --> 02:26:34.530]  Meanwhile, they're not just
[02:26:35.228 --> 02:26:44.993]  Reportedly hiring former Stasi chiefs to help set things up, FBI strikes deal with Russia's FSB in the fight against terrorism.
[02:26:46.935 --> 02:26:49.436]  Same people that like to blow up buildings and blame it on their enemies.
[02:26:49.476 --> 02:26:50.296]  They're working together.
[02:26:51.237 --> 02:26:59.361]  The FBI and Russia's FSB, formerly known as KGB, have struck a deal in the fight against international terrorism, signing a historic memorandum yesterday.
[02:26:59.521 --> 02:27:03.824]  FSB Director, Nikolai Partzharev,
[02:27:04.875 --> 02:27:17.305]  Met with FBI head Robert Mueller who was on a visit to Moscow to sign the deal which draws out plans for cooperation between the two security bodies, the Russian information agency Novostok reported.
[02:27:19.867 --> 02:27:25.451]  Oh boy, we'll finish up with this and a bunch of other news and take your calls on the other side of this quick break.
[02:27:25.491 --> 02:27:30.135]  Don't forget Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.tv, our websites.
[02:27:30.735 --> 02:27:31.296]  Check them out!
[02:27:36.163 --> 02:27:37.084]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.565 --> 02:27:39.187]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.088 --> 02:27:42.771]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.917 --> 02:27:48.398]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.598 --> 02:27:55.942]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:56.262 --> 02:28:00.664]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.944 --> 02:28:10.769]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:11.530 --> 02:28:15.194]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:28:15.534 --> 02:28:18.037]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:28:18.338 --> 02:28:24.245]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:28:24.505 --> 02:28:26.127]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:28:26.327 --> 02:28:27.208]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:28:27.308 --> 02:28:29.291]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds
[02:28:29.531 --> 02:28:30.272]  Every year.
[02:28:30.432 --> 02:28:31.333]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[02:28:31.373 --> 02:28:31.553]  That's 800-255-1912.
[02:28:31.613 --> 02:28:34.696]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:28:34.716 --> 02:28:35.677]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:46.483 --> 02:28:50.044]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:50.084 --> 02:28:50.604]  are located?
[02:28:50.804 --> 02:28:54.185]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:28:54.405 --> 02:28:59.126]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:28:59.406 --> 02:29:10.668]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.

[02:29:38.405 --> 02:29:39.148]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:39.650 --> 02:29:44.446]  To order on the web or at Berkeywater.com.
[02:29:46.716 --> 02:29:48.237]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:29:48.297 --> 02:29:50.698]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:29:51.058 --> 02:29:51.939]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:29:52.299 --> 02:29:53.520]  Oil War III has started.
[02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:56.281]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:29:56.682 --> 02:30:00.083]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:30:00.504 --> 02:30:01.344]  Why else would the U.S.
[02:30:01.364 --> 02:30:04.326]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:30:04.586 --> 02:30:05.847]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:30:06.307 --> 02:30:10.789]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:30:11.210 --> 02:30:15.192]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:30:15.712 --> 02:30:21.615]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[02:30:21.855 --> 02:30:27.958]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[02:30:28.478 --> 02:30:28.818]  That's 800-453-2202.
[02:30:29.078 --> 02:30:34.741]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[02:30:35.161 --> 02:30:35.401]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:30:35.421 --> 02:30:37.542]  Pre-email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[02:30:37.582 --> 02:30:37.882]  That's 800-453-2202.
[02:31:03.972 --> 02:31:04.933]  I love America.
[02:31:04.973 --> 02:31:05.854]  I love my family.
[02:31:05.894 --> 02:31:08.175]  I love God, first and foremost.
[02:31:08.636 --> 02:31:19.763]  And I know we've got a corrupt elite running things who've been caught thousands of times, lying on purpose, doing horrible things, things that are almost unimaginable to people that have never, you know, thought about this type of stuff.
[02:31:20.862 --> 02:31:22.023]  And it's really going on.
[02:31:22.303 --> 02:31:23.224]  And it's really happening.
[02:31:23.244 --> 02:31:25.366]  So stop fooling yourself and being naive.
[02:31:25.766 --> 02:31:27.487]  Realize what's happening to this society.
[02:31:27.507 --> 02:31:29.649]  A pack of criminals is in control.
[02:31:30.170 --> 02:31:33.552]  They don't care about your freedom, your family, your financial safety.
[02:31:33.572 --> 02:31:34.213]  They don't care.
[02:31:34.994 --> 02:31:36.415]  You better get informed and get involved.
[02:31:36.955 --> 02:31:40.098]  David and Spencer and Mike and Chris and John and others, your calls are coming up.
[02:31:41.839 --> 02:31:43.981]  Have we even had a single female caller today?
[02:31:45.079 --> 02:31:47.240]  Some days we get a lot of female callers, some days we don't.
[02:31:47.980 --> 02:31:53.483]  I know the phones are loaded, but when you hear me go to a caller, if the women would like to call in, I always like to hear from you, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:53.503 --> 02:31:54.423]  I get like 50-50 though, emails.
[02:31:54.823 --> 02:31:56.304]  Women email me a lot.
[02:31:56.324 --> 02:32:00.805]  They call some, but I'd say 25% of our callers are women.
[02:32:01.266 --> 02:32:03.567]  Not today though, it's 100% men.
[02:32:03.587 --> 02:32:04.487]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:32:12.836 --> 02:32:14.197]  Let me go through some more news.
[02:32:14.877 --> 02:32:18.058]  Here's some really important financial and election news as well.
[02:32:19.259 --> 02:32:24.501]  Just briefly, I would encourage every single one of you out there to grab a pen and paper right now.
[02:32:25.121 --> 02:32:25.982]  Couple different things.
[02:32:26.782 --> 02:32:32.965]  I'm doing a contest at ArnoldExposed.com for Americans Against Arnold.
[02:32:33.305 --> 02:32:34.545]  $2,000 for the best TV spot.
[02:32:36.206 --> 02:32:36.966]  60 or 30 seconds.
[02:32:36.986 --> 02:32:38.627]  $1,000 for the best radio spot.
[02:32:39.187 --> 02:32:40.628]  And I've just gotten a few of these in.
[02:32:41.733 --> 02:32:44.154]  I've gotten thousands of emails about other subjects.
[02:32:44.534 --> 02:32:44.894]  I don't know.
[02:32:45.374 --> 02:32:52.095]  Last time I checked, four or five days ago, there was over six million visitors to the website since we launched it two weeks ago.
[02:32:53.896 --> 02:33:00.817]  Maybe I haven't put it up there prominent enough about the contest, but you can mail to 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:33:00.857 --> 02:33:02.057]  The video or the audio spot
[02:33:09.978 --> 02:33:14.521]  And if you've got it online, you can send me a link to it online or to the audio.
[02:33:17.142 --> 02:33:18.923]  But keep sending it until you get a response.
[02:33:19.003 --> 02:33:20.624]  We do read all the email, but it's hard.
[02:33:20.664 --> 02:33:21.424]  It's a big job.
[02:33:21.705 --> 02:33:22.865]  We're like three people to do it.
[02:33:24.446 --> 02:33:28.348]  And I was going to have it December 1st, but I want to give people more time.
[02:33:28.368 --> 02:33:29.769]  I guess the holiday people are so busy.
[02:33:31.410 --> 02:33:32.391]  Back it out to December 15th.
[02:33:32.431 --> 02:33:34.752]  I mean, excuse me, not December 1st.
[02:33:35.152 --> 02:33:36.113]  January 1st.
[02:33:37.539 --> 02:33:41.701]  But we might back it up to like December or January 15th or something.
[02:33:42.082 --> 02:33:43.082]  Sorry if I sound braindead.
[02:33:43.102 --> 02:33:45.063]  I got a fever and got a pretty bad cold.
[02:33:45.504 --> 02:33:48.745]  Woke up at 3 in the morning with it last night, so I'm kind of babbling incoherently.
[02:33:49.406 --> 02:33:52.307]  But the contest, again, was going to be January 1st.
[02:33:52.347 --> 02:33:56.950]  I was going to announce who the winner was, but I want to get more respondents to this.
[02:33:58.571 --> 02:34:00.772]  So help us spread the word on that one.
[02:34:01.816 --> 02:34:07.861]  And, uh, there's a lot of new articles, new information, ArnoldExposed.com, please spread the word on that as well.
[02:34:08.301 --> 02:34:10.623]  Get that out to everybody, email that out to everybody.
[02:34:12.824 --> 02:34:23.452]  It's so important because now it's becoming more and more mainstream that this guy's going to be running for President in 2008, and that they're confident that they can change the Constitution by then to do it.
[02:34:24.353 --> 02:34:28.176]  And I've gotten a lot of emails saying, well, if 80% of people in polls are against it,
[02:34:30.307 --> 02:34:31.848]  Then why are you so worried?
[02:34:31.888 --> 02:34:33.129]  Well, some polls show 58%.
[02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:35.791]  Because they don't care what the polls say.
[02:34:35.811 --> 02:34:38.573]  They're going to keep repeating it and pushing it until we go along with it.
[02:34:39.534 --> 02:34:40.735]  That's the whole point of this.
[02:34:43.256 --> 02:34:44.737]  So, please help us with that fight.
[02:34:45.098 --> 02:34:47.619]  And then also, don't forget, I have made 11 films.
[02:34:47.639 --> 02:34:49.321]  11 videos.
[02:34:50.982 --> 02:34:52.703]  And the videos are excellent.
[02:34:52.763 --> 02:34:54.604]  And some of them are almost 3 hours long.
[02:34:54.664 --> 02:34:58.367]  Like Police State 3 Total Enslavement is really 3 or 4 films in one.
[02:34:59.039 --> 02:35:01.341]  9-11 The Road to Tyranny, two and a half hours long.
[02:35:01.841 --> 02:35:02.682]  Actually, more than that.
[02:35:03.162 --> 02:35:04.604]  The DVD's almost three hours.
[02:35:06.245 --> 02:35:12.470]  Right now we got specials on some of the videos, including my newest one, American Dictators, where you buy one copy for $19.95.
[02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:15.692]  Each additional copy is $5.95.
[02:35:17.154 --> 02:35:18.795]  Get three or four copies and give us gifts.
[02:35:19.456 --> 02:35:22.598]  So please call, please take action, get the films.
[02:35:22.798 --> 02:35:26.641]  Know that the mainstream media has to keep reapplying their lies.
[02:35:27.222 --> 02:35:28.623]  Once we show somebody the truth,
[02:35:29.341 --> 02:35:30.542]  We unlock that mind.
[02:35:30.602 --> 02:35:31.842]  That's why we're so effective.
[02:35:31.862 --> 02:35:35.324]  That's why we have the power to change things.
[02:35:35.984 --> 02:35:41.906]  If you'll take action, you give this movement power every time you take action, in every little way, every day.
[02:35:42.607 --> 02:35:43.567]  Call for your number to order.
[02:35:43.587 --> 02:35:44.327]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:35:44.367 --> 02:35:44.708]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:36:00.688 --> 02:36:02.009]  I shouldn't have done this show today, folks.
[02:36:02.749 --> 02:36:03.249]  Excuse me.
[02:36:06.890 --> 02:36:09.870]  Hit the cough button there.
[02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:16.871]  Or order via our safe, secure online shopping cart at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:36:16.911 --> 02:36:22.352]  You can also subscribe at PrisonPlanet.tv and get all the books, the e-books, and all the videos.
[02:36:22.432 --> 02:36:23.052]  It's all right there.
[02:36:23.092 --> 02:36:23.593]  It's a great deal.
[02:36:24.273 --> 02:36:24.653]  All right.
[02:36:26.713 --> 02:36:31.554]  Let me go through some more of this news and then we will go to your calls.
[02:36:32.974 --> 02:36:36.175]  Cover as much as I can before I have another coughing attack.
[02:36:42.356 --> 02:36:42.836]  OPEC.
[02:36:42.956 --> 02:36:47.577]  Nations seen cutting worldwide deposits in dollars.
[02:36:47.717 --> 02:36:50.658]  Now we already knew this, but here it is in the New York Times yesterday.
[02:36:52.398 --> 02:36:56.239]  Member nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
[02:36:56.986 --> 02:37:08.275]  Have cut the production of their deposits, denominated in dollars by more than 13% points in the past three years, mainly to the advantage of the Euro.
[02:37:08.295 --> 02:37:11.558]  The Bank of International Settlements said Sunday.
[02:37:13.059 --> 02:37:13.500]  Big deal.
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:14.781]  It is a very big deal.
[02:37:15.361 --> 02:37:20.005]  In its latest quarterly report, the Bank for International Settlements
[02:37:20.885 --> 02:37:30.247]  A forum for world central banks attributed the trend partly to United States interest rates having fallen below Eurozone levels.
[02:37:31.607 --> 02:37:46.451]  The report said dollar-denominated deposits fell to 61.5% of total deposits on members of the OPEC in a second quarter of 2004 from 75% in the third quarter of 2001.
[02:37:48.709 --> 02:37:53.472]  The share of Euro-dominated deposits rose 20% to 12% over the same period.
[02:37:56.295 --> 02:38:01.798]  And Bush says it's good to have a weak dollar, so it's only accelerating when they could have easily propped it up.
[02:38:01.819 --> 02:38:02.859]  This is by design.
[02:38:04.741 --> 02:38:05.601]  And it goes on and on.
[02:38:05.621 --> 02:38:07.863]  You can read that at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:38:08.996 --> 02:38:09.537]  It's a big deal.
[02:38:09.857 --> 02:38:10.858]  And Infowars.com.
[02:38:11.178 --> 02:38:11.858]  Here's another one.
[02:38:12.099 --> 02:38:12.739]  AFP.
[02:38:13.080 --> 02:38:17.043]  Dollar hits new low against Euro despite Eurozone call for action.
[02:38:17.603 --> 02:38:26.751]  The dollar sank to a new all-time low against the Euro as markets brushed aside tougher talk from European officials urging action to reduce global economic imbalances.
[02:38:29.914 --> 02:38:33.497]  The single European currency rose to a new all-time high of 1.3467.
[02:38:35.265 --> 02:38:37.786]  Dollars in early trading in London today.
[02:38:38.446 --> 02:38:41.687]  Topping a previous record summit of $134.60.
[02:38:41.747 --> 02:38:44.028]  Scaled on Friday.
[02:38:44.308 --> 02:38:45.448]  So new records every week.
[02:38:46.028 --> 02:38:46.908]  Every three or four days.
[02:38:47.809 --> 02:38:48.829]  Every two business days.
[02:38:49.389 --> 02:38:56.031]  It later fell back slightly to $134.44 against a $1.3405 late Monday.
[02:38:57.352 --> 02:38:58.792]  And it's even worse with the yen.
[02:38:59.052 --> 02:39:02.073]  The Japanese say they don't want to do it, but they may have to start dumping.
[02:39:03.131 --> 02:39:03.911]  Let me hurry here.
[02:39:03.951 --> 02:39:05.212]  I got calls I want to go to.
[02:39:09.214 --> 02:39:12.855]  GPS lets long arm of the law grow.
[02:39:12.935 --> 02:39:13.976]  Colorado Gazette.
[02:39:15.756 --> 02:39:17.617]  Greg Benton has a new job title.
[02:39:17.657 --> 02:39:18.158]  Big Brother.
[02:39:18.238 --> 02:39:19.118]  Old Day Every Day.
[02:39:20.658 --> 02:39:26.180]  He follows his people everywhere, recording each step they take, timing how long they linger in places that are not supposed to be.
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:27.501]  We're tracking them every single minute.
[02:39:27.761 --> 02:39:28.801]  Big Brother is watching you!
[02:39:29.041 --> 02:39:36.925]  Said Benton, who works for Comcor, Inc., a non-profit group that offers programs to rehabilitate criminals.
[02:39:37.605 --> 02:39:42.667]  Comcor recently introduced technology that allows it to peer via satellite into criminals' life.
[02:39:43.368 --> 02:39:50.710]  The problem here is with RFID and the transponders boosted by the cell towers and satellite, it's happening to everybody else, too.
[02:39:51.050 --> 02:39:51.591]  Listen to it.
[02:39:51.651 --> 02:39:52.671]  Big Brother's watching you.
[02:39:52.691 --> 02:39:53.411]  Big Brother's good.
[02:39:53.871 --> 02:39:56.912]  Our goal is to get judges to experiment with it, for the lack of a better word.
[02:39:56.932 --> 02:39:57.752]  They've already been doing that.
[02:39:58.973 --> 02:39:59.473]  Very bad.
[02:40:01.663 --> 02:40:12.985]  Continuing, last week Tom Brokaw had on his newscast, his last newscast, that if you don't take the ID card with the retina scan and if you get away from where you're supposed to be around your house, they kill you on the spot.
[02:40:13.565 --> 02:40:16.085]  Boston Globe reported on some of that yesterday.
[02:40:16.406 --> 02:40:18.946]  Returning Fallujans will face clampdown.
[02:40:19.646 --> 02:40:20.946]  What wonderful freedom!
[02:40:23.007 --> 02:40:24.827]  Break any rule, we kill you immediately.
[02:40:26.427 --> 02:40:31.068]  CPS is out grabbing blind people's children, and believe it or not, blind folks make great parents.
[02:40:32.008 --> 02:40:32.989]  I've got articles on that.
[02:40:34.109 --> 02:40:35.730]  That's just some of the news here.
[02:40:36.811 --> 02:40:38.232]  Disgusting Bill Clinton!
[02:40:38.252 --> 02:40:39.933]  Reminding me why I can't stand Bill Clinton.
[02:40:40.353 --> 02:40:42.834]  Always promoting Communist China, as everybody else is.
[02:40:43.535 --> 02:40:45.296]  Bill Clinton helps launch search engine.
[02:40:45.556 --> 02:40:54.201]  Former President Bill Clinton, on Monday, helped launch a new internet search company, backed by the Chinese government, which says its technology uses artificial intelligence to produce better results than Google.
[02:40:54.982 --> 02:40:58.924]  Folks, the Communist Chinese have their own version of Google now, where they're censoring everything.
[02:40:59.739 --> 02:41:02.421]  I hope you all make lots of money, told the commies.
[02:41:02.802 --> 02:41:12.690]  Told executives at the launch of Aconuna Corp, which donated an undisclosed amount to the William J. Clinton Foundation.
[02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:20.576]  The Chinese government is the central backer and is granted a 20-year exclusive partnership with the China Daily Information Company.
[02:41:21.517 --> 02:41:22.178]  Just sick.
[02:41:22.758 --> 02:41:23.559]  Totally sick.
[02:41:25.841 --> 02:41:27.322]  And then we've got more here.
[02:41:28.556 --> 02:41:29.557]  Oh, there's so much more.
[02:41:29.577 --> 02:41:30.899]  We'll get to this in a little while.
[02:41:30.919 --> 02:41:32.121]  I want to go to calls right now.
[02:41:32.701 --> 02:41:36.066]  Let's go ahead and talk to... We're going to go to these calls quickly.
[02:41:36.807 --> 02:41:37.748]  David in Illinois.
[02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:38.209]  Go ahead.
[02:41:38.229 --> 02:41:39.891]  Hello, Alex.
[02:41:39.931 --> 02:41:41.052]  Hope you're feeling better today.
[02:41:41.593 --> 02:41:41.913]  Thank you.
[02:41:42.855 --> 02:41:45.137]  Two points regarding
[02:41:46.246 --> 02:41:47.406]  Internet access.
[02:41:47.747 --> 02:41:50.527]  I'm sure you're aware of Tenet's call.
[02:41:50.888 --> 02:41:52.428]  Yeah, we need to regulate speech.
[02:41:52.468 --> 02:42:00.431]  They had a sitcom, said it last week, and now Bush did sign on to starting internet taxation in 2007, and it's billed as not taxing.
[02:42:01.431 --> 02:42:02.431]  I'm going to tax you!
[02:42:02.471 --> 02:42:03.512]  Look, I'm against taxes!
[02:42:04.312 --> 02:42:07.113]  It's like they allege Arnold's dad was a Nazi.
[02:42:07.433 --> 02:42:09.814]  Alex Jones also alleges the sun comes up in the morning.
[02:42:10.888 --> 02:42:11.609]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:11.869 --> 02:42:12.369]  It's okay.
[02:42:12.489 --> 02:42:13.830]  It goes beyond taxing.
[02:42:14.391 --> 02:42:19.915]  He's wanting to actually limit access to people who take security seriously.
[02:42:20.136 --> 02:42:21.136]  Are you aware of that article?
[02:42:21.757 --> 02:42:24.279]  Yeah, those quotes were in the Associated Press.
[02:42:24.619 --> 02:42:35.028]  Under Internet 2, they're going to phase out Internet 1, start shutting off the switching hubs, and then force you on Internet 2, where you have to get a licensing agreement through a subdomain to even have a website.
[02:42:37.353 --> 02:42:38.174]  That was item number one.
[02:42:38.214 --> 02:42:39.554]  Just wanted to make sure you were aware of that.
[02:42:39.834 --> 02:42:40.735]  Isn't that freedom?
[02:42:40.755 --> 02:42:55.722]  By the way, I went to eat dinner at Marie Callender's this weekend with my wife and family, and the little one-page coloring thing for the kids is cops with billy clubs, and it says they're your heroes, and it says the CIA is law enforcement.
[02:42:56.062 --> 02:42:59.184]  They're here to help you, and it's cops helping children.
[02:42:59.484 --> 02:43:02.685]  I mean, the CIA is not law enforcement, folks.
[02:43:02.865 --> 02:43:04.366]  They're not supposed to be here domestically.
[02:43:04.386 --> 02:43:04.666]  Go ahead.
[02:43:07.000 --> 02:43:28.749]  The second point is, you know how the opposition will dig themselves a hole by maintaining a point that has been proven false, and has a certain amount of compelling evidence that proves it false, or at least brings it into question.
[02:43:29.029 --> 02:43:31.490]  But the general public doesn't know any facts, so they don't want to bring light to it.
[02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:33.610]  But they'll maintain that point.
[02:43:33.890 --> 02:43:34.130]  Yes.
[02:43:34.671 --> 02:43:39.695]  To their own detriment, to their own detriment of credibility, to an extent.
[02:43:40.035 --> 02:43:43.818]  Well, that's like they'll claim they've killed somebody five times and announce they killed them again.
[02:43:43.838 --> 02:43:47.180]  On purpose, they practice lying and being caught.
[02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:48.201]  It's normalization.
[02:43:49.482 --> 02:43:53.705]  I think that that applies to just about everybody, though, including the truth movement.
[02:43:53.885 --> 02:43:57.588]  In 9-11 and the encroachment of the police state,
[02:43:58.343 --> 02:44:03.706]  I think it's time for a little bit of house cleaning here, and I want to bring up one example in particular and see what you think about this.
[02:44:04.486 --> 02:44:07.147]  See if you know of some more information.
[02:44:07.187 --> 02:44:08.448]  Quickly, because I've got loaded phones.
[02:44:08.468 --> 02:44:09.668]  You're a great caller, but go ahead.
[02:44:10.509 --> 02:44:26.376]  The WTC7 and Silverstein's comment that they pulled the building, and it's been interpreted that pull means that they chose to, you know, detonate and collapse the building intentionally.
[02:44:28.018 --> 02:44:35.202]  A argument out there that's countering that is that pull is meant to mean evacuate the firefighters.
[02:44:35.242 --> 02:44:36.683]  Yeah, let me stop right here.
[02:44:37.263 --> 02:44:48.049]  Silverstein says, the building was burning, we gave the order to pull it, gave the order and watched it come down, and then we cut to the engineer going, pulling means demolish, that's what pull means.
[02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:51.891]  Well, the engineer, you're talking about the cleanup engineer?
[02:44:52.352 --> 02:44:52.572]  Yes.
[02:44:53.404 --> 02:45:00.269]  Later on in that video, in the same context, he's saying that they want to pull the Building 6, I believe is what he's saying.
[02:45:00.309 --> 02:45:05.734]  No, I know, but they're explaining later, a month later, when they demolished the wreckage, pulling means pulling a building.
[02:45:06.274 --> 02:45:11.538]  Well, he meant that, and he said, what he said was that they were pulling the Building 6.
[02:45:11.678 --> 02:45:14.340]  Sir, I'm going to repeat this again to you.
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:16.502]  We've played this over and over again.
[02:45:16.742 --> 02:45:17.702]  I've got it on my website.
[02:45:17.742 --> 02:45:19.224]  Hold on a second, I'm stopping you.
[02:45:19.244 --> 02:45:19.484]  I have never
[02:45:23.314 --> 02:45:23.696]  Never!
[02:45:24.580 --> 02:45:24.962]  Never!
[02:45:25.807 --> 02:45:26.168]  Never!
[02:45:26.953 --> 02:45:27.274]  Never!
[02:45:28.130 --> 02:45:48.422]  Never said that he said he was pulling building 7 when the engineer... It's about rebuilding and we play the clip where it said months later they pulled the other buildings that were still standing and we play the engineer saying that to show you that pulling means to demolish.
[02:45:48.923 --> 02:45:53.666]  We play that to indicate that pulling is what pulling means.
[02:45:54.226 --> 02:45:57.468]  Well, when you pull an engine from a car, what do you do to the engine?
[02:45:59.594 --> 02:46:00.614]  You pull it out of the car?
[02:46:00.754 --> 02:46:02.715]  You pull it out of the car, you don't demolish the car.
[02:46:03.375 --> 02:46:06.396]  Sir, sir, Larry Silverstein, sir, sir, what are you saying?
[02:46:06.856 --> 02:46:12.117]  Well, what I'm saying here is that I have Building 7 collapsing on my home page.
[02:46:12.977 --> 02:46:23.319]  I've had it there for a long time, but I have not received as much criticism and argument for anything I've said about 9-11 as I have that.
[02:46:23.779 --> 02:46:26.620]  And the arguments have reached a point to where
[02:46:27.486 --> 02:46:33.908]  I'm reconsidering that because what I want to know is, has anybody interviewed, and this is where you might be able to help.
[02:46:33.968 --> 02:46:42.832]  I've called Silverstein at least 12 times, the mainstream media has, they've run TV ads in New York saying that it was blown up, and Silverstein still won't respond.
[02:46:43.432 --> 02:46:52.715]  But Alex, have you interviewed firemen in that area and asked them, do you guys use the word pull to mean evacuate a building?
[02:46:52.875 --> 02:46:55.056]  Yeah, that's not what he was talking about.
[02:46:55.623 --> 02:47:03.028]  They say we had evacuated the building, and then it shows the building smoking, and we gave the order to pull it, and gave the order and watched it come down.
[02:47:03.608 --> 02:47:06.130]  Well, I'm just wondering if... Listen, I gotta let you go, sir.
[02:47:06.690 --> 02:47:07.391]  I gotta let you go.
[02:47:07.411 --> 02:47:09.352]  You can call me back tomorrow if you want to talk about this.
[02:47:10.032 --> 02:47:13.114]  I may not even have time to get to all these loaded phones now that I've spent five minutes with you.
[02:47:14.966 --> 02:47:16.746]  You know, let's talk about NORAD standing now.
[02:47:16.806 --> 02:47:18.427]  Let's talk about flying out the Bin Ladens.
[02:47:18.467 --> 02:47:20.287]  Let's talk about Operation Northwoods.
[02:47:20.807 --> 02:47:21.827]  The building fell.
[02:47:21.907 --> 02:47:23.207]  It wasn't hit by planes.
[02:47:23.247 --> 02:47:24.688]  It had small fires in it.
[02:47:25.028 --> 02:47:29.309]  The firefighters told AP reporters, get back, the building's coming down.
[02:47:30.249 --> 02:47:31.309]  That's on my website.
[02:47:32.129 --> 02:47:37.210]  And so, and then you're considering, well fine, consider whatever you want.
[02:47:38.170 --> 02:47:42.811]  Larry Silverstein says, we gave the order to pull it, gave the order and watched it come down.
[02:47:43.422 --> 02:47:46.584]  Now, in the industry, pulling it means demolishing a building.
[02:47:47.224 --> 02:47:48.124]  Everybody knows that.
[02:47:48.785 --> 02:47:53.947]  Firefighter engineering said that something was wrong, that buildings don't do that.
[02:47:54.387 --> 02:47:57.509]  You know, jet fuel burns at 1200 degrees, steel burns at over 2000.
[02:47:57.689 --> 02:48:02.992]  There were people standing in the holes in the building where supposedly it was so hot it was melting steel.
[02:48:03.912 --> 02:48:09.074]  So I can't sit here at the end of the show and have a big debate with you.
[02:48:09.915 --> 02:48:12.056]  I don't even understand the debate you're trying to have.
[02:48:13.139 --> 02:48:15.280]  It's very, very confusing.
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:16.840]  They blew up Building 7.
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:19.621]  I've been on record for two plus years saying it.
[02:48:20.041 --> 02:48:22.062]  I've called Silverstein and he doesn't respond.
[02:48:23.182 --> 02:48:28.884]  Jimmy Walter's running TV ads in New York City for a month straight.
[02:48:28.964 --> 02:48:31.605]  He's all over CNN saying Silverstein.
[02:48:32.165 --> 02:48:33.685]  Silverstein doesn't say a word.
[02:48:35.126 --> 02:48:36.326]  Now what does that mean to you?
[02:48:37.467 --> 02:48:40.207]  Any type of mental gymnastics to ignore what's happening.
[02:48:41.308 --> 02:48:41.968]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.925 --> 02:48:47.425]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.625 --> 02:48:50.706]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.846 --> 02:48:54.747]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.787 --> 02:48:59.028]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.368 --> 02:49:03.149]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.269 --> 02:49:05.070]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.690 --> 02:49:08.591]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.631 --> 02:49:13.353]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.493 --> 02:49:16.535]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.715 --> 02:49:19.576]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.076 --> 02:49:26.199]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.719 --> 02:49:30.503]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:57.122 --> 02:52:01.163]  And I challenge that guy to call back into Mark, because that argument didn't sound reality-based.
[02:52:01.523 --> 02:52:06.484]  Here's Larry Silverstein from the PBS documentary, and it shows the building falling behind him as he says this.
[02:52:06.784 --> 02:52:07.564]  This is Silverstein.
[02:52:07.584 --> 02:52:10.684]  Then we're going to play firefighters, talking about how it looked like bombs.
[02:52:10.764 --> 02:52:12.105]  We've got like five different clips of this.
[02:52:12.325 --> 02:52:13.585]  Yeah, I've talked to the firefighters.
[02:52:13.625 --> 02:52:14.525]  I've called them at their homes.
[02:52:14.845 --> 02:52:15.765]  They're scared to talk now.
[02:52:15.785 --> 02:52:16.745]  They've been told to shut up.
[02:52:17.165 --> 02:52:19.166]  But let's go ahead and play Silverstein.
[02:52:20.046 --> 02:52:26.287]  I remember getting a call from the fighter bomber commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:52:29.767 --> 02:52:43.250]  And again, that's after it had been evacuated six hours before.
[02:52:43.290 --> 02:52:44.031]  Everybody knows that.
[02:52:44.531 --> 02:52:48.952]  Now this next clip is the firefighters, and it's only had one cuss word edited out of it.
[02:52:49.252 --> 02:52:50.392]  The video's on the website.
[02:52:50.432 --> 02:52:52.873]  This is them on national TV, right after it happened.
[02:52:52.913 --> 02:52:54.413]  Here's the firefighters at the firehouse.
[02:52:55.091 --> 02:52:55.892]  We made it outside.
[02:52:55.932 --> 02:52:57.093]  We made it about a block.
[02:52:57.273 --> 02:52:59.355]  We made it at least two blocks.
[02:52:59.535 --> 02:53:01.496]  And we started running.
[02:53:01.516 --> 02:53:02.457]  Floor by floor.
[02:53:02.477 --> 02:53:03.398]  It started popping out.
[02:53:03.578 --> 02:53:05.500]  It was like detonating.
[02:53:05.580 --> 02:53:06.380]  Yeah, detonating.
[02:53:06.440 --> 02:53:09.243]  It was like a flare would take down a building.
[02:53:09.383 --> 02:53:09.923]  All the way down.
[02:53:09.943 --> 02:53:11.344]  I was watching it and running.
[02:53:11.504 --> 02:53:12.325]  It just ran up west.
[02:53:12.345 --> 02:53:15.368]  And then you just sort of, this cloud of cheese came down.
[02:53:16.128 --> 02:53:17.209]  It just ran up west for you.
[02:53:17.229 --> 02:53:18.290]  I went out running.
[02:53:18.490 --> 02:53:19.891]  I jumped behind a battalion car.
[02:53:19.931 --> 02:53:20.592]  I hit under the car.
[02:53:20.612 --> 02:53:21.272]  It was swinging.
[02:53:21.412 --> 02:53:21.733]  Okay.
[02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:33.909]  Now, from the same PBS documentary, here is the head engineer for New York describing how a month later they pulled the wreckage of 4, 5, and 6.
[02:53:33.970 --> 02:53:35.891]  He's talking about 5 and 6 here.
[02:53:36.331 --> 02:53:37.552]  And then they pull a building.
[02:53:38.393 --> 02:53:42.737]  Okay, so here, when he says pull, they weren't evacuating the building a month later.
[02:53:43.838 --> 02:53:45.159]  Okay, it's clear.
[02:53:45.219 --> 02:53:46.620]  Pulling doesn't mean evacuating.
[02:53:46.820 --> 02:53:48.101]  You can invent whatever you want.
[02:53:48.361 --> 02:53:48.782]  Here it is.
[02:53:49.605 --> 02:53:56.108]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings 4 and 5.
[02:53:56.188 --> 02:53:59.969]  Hello?
[02:54:01.730 --> 02:54:03.471]  Oh, we're getting ready to fall building 6.
[02:54:06.212 --> 02:54:09.033]  We have to be very careful how we demolish building 6.
[02:54:10.414 --> 02:54:17.537]  We're worried about the building 6 coming down and then damaging the registory wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[02:54:17.757 --> 02:54:18.017]  Okay!
[02:54:18.957 --> 02:54:23.340]  Now, we had to be very careful how we demolished Building 6.
[02:54:24.541 --> 02:54:27.222]  We're getting ready to pull Building 6!
[02:54:28.403 --> 02:54:30.905]  We had to be very careful how we pulled Building 6.
[02:54:32.906 --> 02:54:33.967]  Come on, man!
[02:54:33.987 --> 02:54:36.328]  I got like 20-something clips there on the site.
[02:54:36.969 --> 02:54:38.350]  Play Dan Rather, please.
[02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:41.572]  And again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[02:54:43.542 --> 02:54:47.306]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[02:54:47.406 --> 02:54:49.588]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[02:54:52.571 --> 02:54:57.796]  It's amazing.
[02:54:59.078 --> 02:55:01.100]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[02:55:02.097 --> 02:55:12.919]  For the third time today, reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[02:55:15.160 --> 02:55:24.402]  Alright, so if you get upset by some criticism, which by the way I haven't gotten, then I guess if you got criticized for saying the world was round, just go ahead and go back to saying it's flat.
[02:55:25.569 --> 02:55:30.273]  Now, I'm trying to be mean, but we looked at this very carefully for weeks before we posted it a couple years ago.
[02:55:30.593 --> 02:55:31.614]  We've called Silverstein.
[02:55:31.654 --> 02:55:32.335]  Everybody has.
[02:55:32.675 --> 02:55:34.517]  Major newspapers, I've now learned, have.
[02:55:34.757 --> 02:55:35.678]  And there's no comment!
[02:55:37.760 --> 02:55:39.501]  Building 7 wasn't hit by a jet.
[02:55:39.561 --> 02:55:41.042]  What did make it fall?
[02:55:41.723 --> 02:55:43.224]  And I've called the firefighters at home.
[02:55:45.166 --> 02:55:47.728]  And I know you were quoted in People Magazine as saying, bombs.
[02:55:47.908 --> 02:55:49.470]  I've been told to shut up, sir, please.
[02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:58.155]  The firefighter tapes reported in Tower 1 and 2 the fires were almost out, but they declared Homeland Security or National Security on it and grabbed those.
[02:55:59.576 --> 02:56:00.617]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:56:01.077 --> 02:56:03.659]  You are welcome to call me back tomorrow if I'm not out sick.
[02:56:03.679 --> 02:56:06.882]  I'm not trying to be mean, I'm just very angry about this stuff.
[02:56:07.683 --> 02:56:10.045]  You're welcome to call and we'll have a 30 minute debate about this, brother.
[02:56:10.065 --> 02:56:12.847]  I mean, you just say, well, they probably meant evacuate.
[02:56:13.047 --> 02:56:14.688]  Well, you just heard what they meant by pull.
[02:56:15.329 --> 02:56:16.510]  Demolish this building!
[02:56:17.606 --> 02:56:18.907]  You go, that's six, that's six.
[02:56:19.127 --> 02:56:20.448]  I'm telling you what pool means!
[02:56:20.709 --> 02:56:23.110]  We are showing you what pool means.
[02:56:23.651 --> 02:56:26.073]  Silverstein's talking about seven and saying what pool means.
[02:56:26.353 --> 02:56:28.895]  Then we play six and tell you what pool means.
[02:56:30.516 --> 02:56:33.138]  PrisonPlanet.tv, God bless you all.
