[00:00:05.497 --> 00:00:06.158]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:07.898]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:09.758]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:11.159]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:12.819]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.300]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.781]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:27.163]  Well, a whole week has almost blasted past us.
[00:00:29.743 --> 00:00:30.744]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:30.904 --> 00:00:31.904]  It is Friday.
[00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:37.592]  The 23rd day of January of 2004.
[00:00:37.712 --> 00:00:39.052]  I still can't get used to that.
[00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:41.433]  Seems like yesterday was 1999.
[00:00:43.654 --> 00:00:45.154]  Big broadcast lined up for you.
[00:00:45.174 --> 00:00:51.596]  We've got Operation Rescue West coming on in the second hour.
[00:00:51.636 --> 00:00:56.557]  It's a First Amendment issue, not just trying to stop the 45 million plus murders.
[00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:05.319]  But, you know, they have a big truck with a picture of a little baby, a live baby and then a dead baby on the side.
[00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:10.123]  And they've been arrested and they're being charged.
[00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.787]  They're trying to tell people all over the country that they cannot expose what's really happening.
[00:01:15.407 --> 00:01:20.432]  But PBS can show video of all the dead Jews in World War II.
[00:01:22.103 --> 00:01:27.808]  Images of thousands of naked bodies being bulldozed into pits and I think that's good.
[00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:29.670]  It's good that they show that.
[00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.411]  We should know what evil is all about.
[00:01:31.531 --> 00:01:33.954]  We should see the results of evil.
[00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:37.136]  And what happens when you don't stand up to it.
[00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.778]  But you can show
[00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:52.037]  The murders in Africa, murders by Saddam in the Middle East, you can show murders by Pol Pot, you can show murders by Hitler, but you better not show the murders in this country.
[00:01:52.057 --> 00:01:54.839]  In fact, they're taking down websites that show this all over the place.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.404]  When we've shown videos on television of this, the city threatens to throw us off cable.
[00:02:01.084 --> 00:02:09.231]  You can show anything else you want, but you try to show people how these are babies and they're being killed.
[00:02:10.137 --> 00:02:12.801]  And they will come after you, so that's coming up in the second hour.
[00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:16.826]  A violation of the First Amendment here.
[00:02:18.167 --> 00:02:20.390]  And there is so much just incredible news.
[00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.861]  At the end of the show, I briefly covered an article that I said I would get back into today, and we'll cover this first.
[00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:34.850]  First, this is out of the Washington Post, Making Way for Designer Insects.
[00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.552]  The government has loving mosquitoes.
[00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:41.995]  They want to release to give you your vaccines, whether you like them or not.
[00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:43.912]  Isn't that nice?
[00:02:43.972 --> 00:02:45.352]  Isn't that just special?
[00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:49.835]  And no telling what else these mosquitoes are carrying, but a very scary article.
[00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:54.178]  Everything we've already covered in the past, but here it is in the Washington Post Mainstream News.
[00:02:54.538 --> 00:03:05.125]  And a new article along these lines today that's even scarier, out of the Sydney Morning Herald, called for suicide genes to control GM organisms.
[00:03:06.306 --> 00:03:10.329]  And on its face, anybody that has a basic understanding of the genome,
[00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.697]  The problems they've had, the type of mutations that occur.
[00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:25.546]  This is, again, if somebody wants to make a scary science fiction movie, they should do it along these lines.
[00:03:26.147 --> 00:03:26.948]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:38.650]  Also, I always watch the Davos Economic Forum very closely, because they forecast what they're going to do to us beforehand, years beforehand, in Switzerland.
[00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:48.341]  John Ashcroft went and said, hey, we're all going to make money off of Bin Laden, off Al-Qaeda, and this is a big new business.
[00:03:48.381 --> 00:03:49.482]  This is the new economy.
[00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:52.289]  Well, how many times have I said that?
[00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:54.671]  It's not because I have a crystal ball.
[00:03:55.111 --> 00:04:07.022]  I saw Governor Ridge, over a year and a half ago, for two hours, say that to have a job, live your life, we'll all be surveilled, we'll all be watched, we'll all be controlled, everything we buy and sell will be tracked.
[00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.384]  This is worse than 1984.
[00:04:10.044 --> 00:04:16.030]  And here is the Associated Press headline, CEOs at Forum assess Al-Qaeda as a business.
[00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:17.491]  And it is.
[00:04:17.571 --> 00:04:18.392]  It's their excuse.
[00:04:19.338 --> 00:04:26.342]  To bring the military-industrial complex into your life to be your owner, your master, your controller, your dehumanizer.
[00:04:26.882 --> 00:04:29.123]  So we'll get into that for you, and also...
[00:04:30.071 --> 00:04:32.352]  Another article here.
[00:04:33.152 --> 00:04:35.132]  Secrecy reigns at Global Economic Forum.
[00:04:35.152 --> 00:04:35.793]  Very interesting.
[00:04:36.813 --> 00:04:39.994]  Bush's push for illegals creating an anxious nation.
[00:04:40.654 --> 00:04:54.058]  They've got this Fox News psychiatrist saying, I've had record conservatives who've never been to a psychiatrist coming to me because they had a personal relationship with George Bush and their imaginary little world and now it's all shattering.
[00:04:54.078 --> 00:04:55.958]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:04:56.558 --> 00:04:57.659]  We'll be back with that too.
[00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:58.679]  You don't want to miss this show.
[00:05:00.956 --> 00:05:02.757]  Got $3 in your pocket?
[00:05:02.977 --> 00:05:05.839]  Want a million dollars in term life insurance coverage?
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.901]  Call Term Busters now!
[00:05:08.221 --> 00:05:09.602]  Rates are low right now.
[00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:10.903]  Call and compare.
[00:05:11.143 --> 00:05:21.631]  For example, a man age 45, non-tobacco user, issue preferred $1 million of coverage is only $75 a month, level for the next 10 years.
[00:05:21.931 --> 00:05:23.552]  Call Term Busters now!
[00:05:23.592 --> 00:05:23.792]  Call 800-430-6692
[00:05:53.992 --> 00:06:05.355]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:09.976]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:06:10.096 --> 00:06:14.477]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:06:14.517 --> 00:06:15.877]  The New World Order.
[00:06:16.677 --> 00:06:17.618]  Panama!
[00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:21.881]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:06:21.961 --> 00:06:28.865]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:06:29.025 --> 00:06:31.087]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:06:31.407 --> 00:06:41.694]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:06:42.014 --> 00:06:47.376]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!
[00:06:47.877 --> 00:06:51.378]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.398 --> 00:06:51.798]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:51.818 --> 00:06:52.959]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:07:00.646 --> 00:07:11.378]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:07:11.558 --> 00:07:19.086]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:19.366 --> 00:07:22.548]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:07:22.788 --> 00:07:28.531]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:34.974]  Made of durable lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:07:35.334 --> 00:07:39.235]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:07:39.275 --> 00:07:41.176]  The water level is always visible.
[00:07:41.356 --> 00:07:47.278]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:07:47.538 --> 00:07:51.479]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:52.059]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:08:01.773 --> 00:08:07.415]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.435 --> 00:08:18.659]  All right, my friends, it is Friday.
[00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:20.280]  Again, thanks for joining us.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:21.180]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.020]  I love freedom.
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.241]  I can't stand tyranny.
[00:08:24.756 --> 00:08:28.557]  And freedom is in short supply worldwide right now.
[00:08:29.517 --> 00:08:42.901]  Governments are shifting our economy into the post-industrial society, the fourth wave, the information merger, information technology merger with biotech.
[00:08:43.821 --> 00:08:53.164]  They're building a total control grid, an electronic cashless society prison around us, and it must be resisted.
[00:08:54.403 --> 00:08:57.025]  Okay, coming up, the Davos Economic Forum.
[00:08:57.705 --> 00:09:04.269]  Bush's illegal alien worship is really causing him more problems than I think he thought.
[00:09:04.289 --> 00:09:20.760]  I think Karl Rove, the Chief of the White House there, White House Chief of Staff, I think misjudged because I'm even shocked by the level of people finally waking up to this, but they'll probably be back to worshiping Bush by next week.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.823]  Especially when he signs the assault weapons ban, they'll say that's very conservative and that I'm evil and liberal because I'm against it.
[00:09:27.484 --> 00:09:29.065]  Because I'm for guns, you know, that's liberal.
[00:09:29.705 --> 00:09:34.288]  But also, US war on terror may spread to Syria, report says.
[00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:36.109]  Again, they already have the official battle plan.
[00:09:37.069 --> 00:09:53.137]  Seven State Info store a potent repository of personal data and they're now admitting in the Miami Herald, something I wrote last year in my DARPA Engineering the Beast System article, that the Matrix System is total information, is extra line.
[00:09:53.597 --> 00:09:57.299]  They just put out different names to confuse you about an already existing system.
[00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:59.840]  Guard survey hints at exodus.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:03.762]  They were lied to, the National Guard was, about what their tour of duty would be.
[00:10:04.423 --> 00:10:06.224]  Prince Charles to be quizzed.
[00:10:06.704 --> 00:10:13.728]  Britain's most senior police officer will reportedly personally ask Prince Charles if he plotted to kill Diana, Princess of Wales.
[00:10:13.748 --> 00:10:15.209]  That's from Sky Television News.
[00:10:15.809 --> 00:10:19.451]  Mars Orbiter confirms evidence of water on surface of Mars.
[00:10:20.171 --> 00:10:22.853]  CIA, Iraq at risk of civil war.
[00:10:23.993 --> 00:10:25.754]  Bush wants Patriot Act renewed.
[00:10:26.274 --> 00:10:27.555]  Some new developments on that.
[00:10:27.655 --> 00:10:29.656]  Also a story here.
[00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:31.216]  That's very interesting.
[00:10:31.236 --> 00:10:32.417]  September 11th, Widow.
[00:10:32.497 --> 00:10:33.758]  Government hides truth.
[00:10:34.418 --> 00:10:37.720]  And we've interviewed her, but there have been some new developments there.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:39.961]  UM researchers.
[00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:43.822]  Burning fossil fuel has a measurable cooling effect on the climate.
[00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:45.283]  New scientific studies on that.
[00:10:46.364 --> 00:10:50.846]  That are certainly disproving the claims of global warming.
[00:10:51.747 --> 00:10:56.731]  And a French Foreign Minister calls for strategic partnership with the EU and Russia.
[00:10:56.751 --> 00:10:58.292]  That's been the plan all along.
[00:10:58.632 --> 00:11:05.017]  That and a lot more, but before I detail the articles I just mentioned, let me first cover this before I forget to ever get to it.
[00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:21.330]  Because yesterday at the end of the show I just briefly mentioned it, and we could easily spend two hours, three hours on this subject and do that many times, do many broadcasts on the subject of genetic engineering.
[00:11:22.941 --> 00:11:31.472]  And the average person I don't think really grasps how dangerous this is, how serious this is, how revolutionary this is.
[00:11:34.115 --> 00:11:35.216]  We're trying to play God.
[00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:48.174]  And when they talk about genetic engineering on the news, it's like, oh, farmers for thousands of years have cross-bred plants and engaged in their own genetic engineering.
[00:11:48.234 --> 00:11:51.297]  Why, we've all done it with dog breeding.
[00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:52.598]  It's no big deal.
[00:11:53.672 --> 00:12:12.845]  Well, breeding dogs that have certain characteristics or crossing two types of squash or eggplant is completely different and not even in the same realm as putting insect genes in most of the produce that we now consume and grow, grow and consume.
[00:12:13.625 --> 00:12:40.097]  It is a completely different universe from putting animal genes in other animals, human genes in pigs, spider genes in goats, shark genes in monkeys, putting AIDS virus, making corn grow AIDS virus and other biologicals and chemicals in open air, growing it in locations all over the country.
[00:12:40.597 --> 00:12:42.178]  This is all going on everywhere!
[00:12:43.891 --> 00:12:57.301]  With no controls of any type, the government is encouraging it, and they've had big CEOs of some of the big biotech companies over the last four years come out and say, hey, we're going to go ahead and contaminate everything with GMO, and then you won't have a choice.
[00:12:57.321 --> 00:12:58.122]  You'll have to eat it.
[00:12:58.502 --> 00:13:00.884]  And then they own the federal courts and the international courts.
[00:13:01.344 --> 00:13:03.286]  When their genes get into your crops,
[00:13:03.986 --> 00:13:12.092]  Even if you have a record that you bought clean seeds that had nothing to do with their patented genetics, they come and take your property.
[00:13:12.852 --> 00:13:15.174]  They come and contaminate your land.
[00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:24.760]  It's like if they patented cyanide and then put it on your land and it killed your farm animals and then they sued you for having their precious cyanide in your animals.
[00:13:25.663 --> 00:13:27.183]  But the courts will rule for them.
[00:13:27.883 --> 00:13:30.424]  And that's an analogy, the cyanide analogy.
[00:13:30.864 --> 00:13:34.085]  It's actually more dangerous than cyanide because the effects never go away.
[00:13:34.525 --> 00:13:38.125]  It just keeps spreading into the genetic biosphere.
[00:13:39.065 --> 00:13:46.047]  The world complex of interplay in the environment.
[00:13:46.487 --> 00:13:48.327]  But the environmental groups aren't worried about this.
[00:13:48.347 --> 00:13:51.568]  They want to grab your farm or ranch and they've got big bank funding.
[00:13:51.588 --> 00:13:53.028]  I've been to the Smart Growth Conferences.
[00:13:54.289 --> 00:13:56.712]  So listen to this out of the Sydney Morning Herald today.
[00:13:57.253 --> 00:14:01.318]  Call for suicide genes to control genetically modified organisms.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:08.468]  Now, three years ago, the Australian government developed a mouse box that kills 100% of the mice.
[00:14:09.289 --> 00:14:10.110]  They put out the
[00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:23.999]  The procedure on the internet in full of how to make a smallpox weapon that will kill any mammal that you design it for, including humans, with a 100% kill rate.
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.742]  And they then put the design on the internet.
[00:14:28.423 --> 00:14:35.309]  And they've now made a bunch of other special pox's that will kill all of the species it comes in contact with.
[00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:45.771]  And now they say the terrorists have gotten the ingredients, which they put on the internet, and are going to get us any day with it, so we'll have to go into a new level of hyper-police state to keep us all safe from it.
[00:14:46.811 --> 00:14:52.433]  Their new answer is to build into genetically modified organisms a suicide gene.
[00:14:53.213 --> 00:14:57.234]  And of course, that gene will be passed on into the rest of the biosphere.
[00:14:57.854 --> 00:15:00.114]  It'll do the exact opposite of what they're claiming.
[00:15:00.915 --> 00:15:02.535]  Mutation has always shown this.
[00:15:03.855 --> 00:15:09.558]  And this is what the big Monsantos and others have called for.
[00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:14.620]  They want plants that do not produce seeds that produce other plants.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.881]  They want you to have to go back to them every year and buy the seeds.
[00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:20.763]  They want to patent the life process.
[00:15:20.803 --> 00:15:22.423]  They want to kill it in its tracks.
[00:15:22.824 --> 00:15:27.106]  This is blasphemous at every level you can imagine.
[00:15:27.966 --> 00:15:29.807]  It's creating a monopoly of life.
[00:15:31.061 --> 00:15:40.498]  I hope I'm articulating this and trying to relay the magnitude of it, the colossal, unspeakable, mad dash for total control.
[00:15:41.744 --> 00:15:52.572]  Government agencies should consider requiring the use of suicide genes or other biological tools to keep genetically engineered organisms from spreading artificial genetic strain into the environment, which has already happened, by the way.
[00:15:53.333 --> 00:15:56.415]  A committee of United States scientists has recommended, the committee urged the U.S.
[00:15:56.435 --> 00:16:05.401]  Department of Agriculture, for which it prepared its report, to consider bioconfinement technologies to keep the organisms under control.
[00:16:05.742 --> 00:16:09.925]  These techniques would add genetic traits that make the newly created lifeforms sterile,
[00:16:10.842 --> 00:16:13.484]  Or cause them to destroy themselves after a time.
[00:16:13.824 --> 00:16:18.827]  And again, those genetic traits will get passed into the biosphere, which is what they want to do.
[00:16:19.447 --> 00:16:22.509]  And then when the crisis begins, there'll be no discussion of who started it.
[00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:35.958]  The report released by the National Academy of Sciences says that while many technologies are being developed to prevent genetically engineered organisms or their genes from escaping into the world, most are still in the early stages and none appears to be completely effective.
[00:16:36.894 --> 00:16:48.986]  Companies and scientists are developing a wide range of genetic modified organisms, including salmon that grow super fast, mosquitoes engineered not to transmit malaria, and corn that produces pharmacologicals and industrial chemicals.
[00:16:49.666 --> 00:16:57.374]  Yeah, a protein gene in Texas planted in 96 locations from Nebraska to Texas to Iowa aids corn.
[00:16:57.414 --> 00:16:58.335]  That's Associated Press.
[00:16:59.269 --> 00:17:01.271]  Every time I mention that I get emails, that's ridiculous.
[00:17:01.811 --> 00:17:03.792]  You think ProDG would let me get on air and say that?
[00:17:03.812 --> 00:17:05.554]  It's the Associated Press, folks.
[00:17:06.114 --> 00:17:06.615]  It's true.
[00:17:06.635 --> 00:17:15.061]  96 locations, on purpose, it spread into soybeans and got dumped into a granary of seed corn and then no one knows where it went from there.
[00:17:16.162 --> 00:17:20.305]  One concern about these transgenic products is their genes or the organisms can spread.
[00:17:20.805 --> 00:17:26.930]  Fast-growing fish that escape into the wild might beat regular salmon or food or mates and disrupt the ecological balance.
[00:17:28.072 --> 00:17:30.837]  Now again, they want to engineer this suicide gene into stuff.
[00:17:30.857 --> 00:17:33.782]  Well, that's what they're already doing with the Terminator seeds and the rest of it.
[00:17:34.574 --> 00:17:37.795]  This has been their plan, their statements, their corporate minutes.
[00:17:37.855 --> 00:17:39.355]  But now it's to, quote, protect you.
[00:17:39.895 --> 00:17:52.078]  Remember a month ago the BBC reported that a university out in California with federal funding was, quote, trying to weaken tuberculosis and made a super strain that can't be treated.
[00:17:52.098 --> 00:17:54.458]  Of course, that'll accidentally show up.
[00:17:54.918 --> 00:17:55.718]  It always does.
[00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:57.639]  They made the new Lyme disease.
[00:17:57.659 --> 00:17:58.659]  They do it all.
[00:18:00.054 --> 00:18:00.855]  And it goes on and on.
[00:18:01.415 --> 00:18:06.598]  But here was the article out of the Washington Post yesterday, making way for designer insects.
[00:18:06.658 --> 00:18:12.081]  Now, insects are the majority of life forms other than bacteria on this planet.
[00:18:12.201 --> 00:18:14.423]  There are just trillions and trillions of them.
[00:18:15.003 --> 00:18:24.889]  They are the underlying support column, the second chain, the second level in the food chain for everything.
[00:18:25.623 --> 00:18:32.238]  Making way for designer insects, because you have diatoms and plankton and bacteria and viruses at the lowest level.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.787]  Above that you've got the insects.
[00:18:37.084 --> 00:18:40.266]  It says, uh, the insect world could shortly undergo a genetic makeover.
[00:18:40.446 --> 00:18:41.666]  Oh, that's a nice statement.
[00:18:41.886 --> 00:18:42.627]  Oh, just, yeah.
[00:18:43.107 --> 00:18:51.251]  In the laboratory, scientists are at work developing silk worms that produce pharmacologicals instead of silk, honey bees resilient enough to resist pesticides.
[00:18:51.891 --> 00:18:53.312]  Oh, great, so we can use more pesticides.
[00:18:53.352 --> 00:18:58.454]  And even mosquitoes capable of delivering vaccines instead of disease with every bite.
[00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:04.877]  We already know they put out mosquito boxes around the country they use to release different bioweapons.
[00:19:05.689 --> 00:19:07.371]  There's all these new diseases unfolding.
[00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:18.281]  Researchers are tinkering with insect genes to develop more than a dozen new varieties offering potentially broad social benefits while posing complicated new health and environmental risks.
[00:19:19.022 --> 00:19:23.707]  Though most of the designer insects are at least 5 to 10 years away, that's a total lie.
[00:19:24.087 --> 00:19:29.052]  From reality, concern is growing that government agencies have yet to think about how to oversee the research.
[00:19:29.412 --> 00:19:39.376]  A new report scheduled for release this morning warns that the issues posed by gene-altering insects are so complex that unless government agencies begin now to design methods of oversight... Oversight?
[00:19:40.076 --> 00:19:42.357]  It's a revolving door with the biotech companies.
[00:19:42.817 --> 00:19:48.319]  The necessary rules may not be in place when scientists are ready to start releasing insects into the environment.
[00:19:49.699 --> 00:19:52.540]  I was calmly announcing remaking the insect world!
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:53.580]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:19:54.601 --> 00:19:56.321]  And yeah, playin' God, folks!
[00:19:57.282 --> 00:19:58.082]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.397 --> 00:20:04.301]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotels.
[00:20:04.321 --> 00:20:06.283]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[00:20:06.483 --> 00:20:12.110]  Cheaperhotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCar.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.
[00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:17.997]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.

[00:21:01.734 --> 00:21:03.496]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:07.419]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:21:07.919 --> 00:21:08.560]  Let's update.
[00:21:09.096 --> 00:21:13.838]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:16.900]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.561]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:21:18.581 --> 00:21:20.902]  dollar was worth 17% more than a Euro.
[00:21:21.422 --> 00:21:22.322]  Today, the U.S.
[00:21:22.362 --> 00:21:24.563]  dollar is worth 28% less than a Euro.
[00:21:24.984 --> 00:21:26.504]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:21:27.085 --> 00:21:29.066]  January of 2002, gold's spot was 283.
[00:21:30.426 --> 00:21:35.288]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:21:36.269 --> 00:21:37.029]  Gold is moving.
[00:21:37.289 --> 00:21:38.410]  Equities are treading water.
[00:21:38.837 --> 00:21:41.480]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.401]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:21:43.842 --> 00:21:45.563]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:21:45.984 --> 00:21:47.946]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:21:48.346 --> 00:21:50.468]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.772]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:21:55.172 --> 00:21:55.453]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.618 --> 00:22:07.561]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:22:07.781 --> 00:22:10.042]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:22:16.966 --> 00:22:17.566]  I think so.
[00:22:37.278 --> 00:22:37.658]  I think so.
[00:22:59.184 --> 00:23:06.687]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:23:06.967 --> 00:23:17.892]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:23:18.012 --> 00:23:18.412]  We're good to go!
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.140]  That's right!
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:42.443]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:23:42.723 --> 00:23:46.845]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:23:47.005 --> 00:23:51.466]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:23:51.526 --> 00:23:51.986]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:24:17.966 --> 00:24:27.661]  Alright my friends, we're back live and if you'd like to comment on genetic engineering and how it's been totally unregulated, uncontrolled, turned loose,
[00:24:29.229 --> 00:24:33.151]  And the technologies we're hearing about are decades old by the time they announce them.
[00:24:33.611 --> 00:24:36.592]  The toll-free number to join us on this Live Friday edition is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:36.612 --> 00:24:36.832]  800-259-9231.
[00:24:36.852 --> 00:24:43.295]  But they just calmly announced that, oh yeah, we're going to have mosquitoes flying around giving you your vaccines.
[00:24:52.094 --> 00:24:55.236]  They want to make us take hundreds of vaccines.
[00:24:55.276 --> 00:25:03.261]  They already try to claim that your child has to take 35 plus vaccines by the first grade.
[00:25:04.942 --> 00:25:10.346]  And every year the government will announce that three or four new vaccines are quote mandatory.
[00:25:11.095 --> 00:25:25.930]  Despite the fact that you, by law, don't have to take them, they'll try to intimidate you into it, and so they'll just be releasing lots of mosquitoes with the new special vaccines for you, and then they'll tell you what those vaccines will do, what those...
[00:25:28.883 --> 00:25:31.465]  Organisms will do, because they'll have to be live organisms.
[00:25:31.485 --> 00:25:38.790]  It can't be a dead pathogen that they're putting in the mosquitoes, because then it wouldn't be carried very long or transmits.
[00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:58.303]  They'll have these new live, engineered, supposedly weakened diseases in the vaccines, in the mosquitoes, and they'll come bite you, and of course there'll be mutations, they'll claim when it starts causing big problems, and then they'll take more of your freedoms to quote, keep you safe from it, and
[00:25:58.983 --> 00:26:06.487]  They're already saying that they're going to engineer bananas, potatoes, you name it, that have vaccines in them, and she's called for our safety, folks.
[00:26:06.507 --> 00:26:11.450]  So we have to take what they think we need to have, because they care so much about us.
[00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:17.172]  The insect world could shortly undergo a genetic makeover in the laboratory.
[00:26:17.212 --> 00:26:27.878]  Scientists are at work developing silkworms that produce pharmacologicals instead of silk, honeybees resilient enough to resist pesticides, and even mosquitoes capable of delivering vaccines instead of diseases with every bite.
[00:26:28.467 --> 00:26:32.828]  Researchers are tinkering with insect genes to develop more than a dozen new varieties.
[00:26:34.428 --> 00:26:46.091]  And it says, the report by the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology at Think Tank in Washington outlined laboratory work of astonishing ambition with goals that go far beyond the relatively limited use to which genetic engineering has been put to date.
[00:26:46.751 --> 00:26:53.133]  Researchers are already underway, for instance, to create mosquitoes with genes that render them incapable of transmitting malaria.
[00:26:53.962 --> 00:27:03.286]  With the idea that the souped-up mosquitoes would be released into the environment to spread their new genes into every type of mosquito capable of curing the disease!
[00:27:04.007 --> 00:27:10.150]  Hilarious, sickens more than thirty three hundred million people a year and kills more than a million, many of them, babies in Africa.
[00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.910]  So see, it's good.
[00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:22.736]  But notice where the World Bank and IMF and others have been, the World Health Organization in Africa, you have some countries with forty-five percent of the population with AIDS, and it's been confirmed that it's people getting it who've never had sex,
[00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:46.247]  His parents don't have it, you name it, little baby's getting it, who just so happen to get their special inoculations, then we have Ted Turner and Prince Philip and the World Health Organization and the Henry Kissinger's public documents, the CIA documents that are on the website, where they openly say they want to kill half the third world population, and then that just magically starts to happen and we're all supposed to just trust them.
[00:27:47.199 --> 00:27:57.166]  People saying that they want to come back, reincarnated as viruses, to kill 80 plus percent of us, like Prince Philip said in his book, If I Was an Animal, the guy that heads up the World Wildlife Fund.
[00:27:57.186 --> 00:28:03.711]  Now you've got all these billionaires that give billions to, quote, vaccinate the third world, because they love them so much.
[00:28:04.312 --> 00:28:07.194]  You've all heard of that, with Bill Gates and others.
[00:28:08.114 --> 00:28:09.315]  It's just sick, folks.
[00:28:09.435 --> 00:28:14.519]  It's right out in plain view, and it's so horrible, people can't come to terms with it.
[00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:22.518]  So they go into this article about how wonderful all this will be and how good it will be and it will save the little African babies because they care about them so much.
[00:28:24.441 --> 00:28:27.985]  And there is no oversight to this stuff.
[00:28:28.205 --> 00:28:30.668]  You want open air corn plants with HIV in them?
[00:28:31.209 --> 00:28:31.589]  Boom!
[00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.970]  Do it!
[00:28:32.867 --> 00:28:48.622]  You want to engineer grasses and trees and not just food plants but now grasses and trees are now being patented by Monsanto and they open air plant them and suddenly their genes are spreading into almost every plant variety on the planet and suddenly plants can't produce other plants.
[00:28:48.702 --> 00:28:49.063]  Oh that's a
[00:28:49.543 --> 00:28:52.605]  Wonderful thing to do, spreading a scourge like that.
[00:28:52.865 --> 00:29:06.291]  There's new super weeds, you'll have a corn field or a soybean field that's got pesticide resistance in it and it suddenly spreads off into, they find it in oak trees and different grasses and really bizarre.
[00:29:06.411 --> 00:29:12.054]  And then there's all these weird new funguses growing all over the planet, killing trees and other plants.
[00:29:13.095 --> 00:29:18.323]  They go study the fungus and it's got genetic engineered traits in it and there's just no real discussion of that.
[00:29:18.643 --> 00:29:20.286]  Let's just continue with what we were doing.
[00:29:21.848 --> 00:29:22.829]  What do you think about this?
[00:29:22.849 --> 00:29:22.910]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:28.792 --> 00:29:30.953]  They don't ask you to put the cameras up in your neighborhood.
[00:29:30.973 --> 00:29:34.473]  They don't ask you about the police putting black helmets on them and giving them machine guns.
[00:29:34.793 --> 00:29:37.614]  They don't ask you about genetically engineering the entire biosphere.
[00:29:38.414 --> 00:29:40.635]  They don't ask you when they're going to get the border wide open.
[00:29:41.095 --> 00:29:42.115]  They just do it!
[00:29:42.815 --> 00:29:44.976]  Bunch of other news on the World Economic Forum.
[00:29:45.376 --> 00:29:47.196]  They say the terror war is a big business.
[00:29:47.837 --> 00:29:48.697]  And a lot more.
[00:29:48.717 --> 00:29:50.257]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.397 --> 00:29:52.298]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.778 --> 00:29:54.398]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.318 --> 00:29:57.999]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.724 --> 00:30:05.285]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[00:30:05.606 --> 00:30:05.946]  Yes.
[00:30:06.226 --> 00:30:08.587]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood.
[00:30:08.847 --> 00:30:11.008]  The richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[00:30:11.148 --> 00:30:20.071]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, 2 ounces of juice have the same nutrition as 3 pounds of choice garden produce.
[00:30:20.211 --> 00:30:27.934]  The get up and go energy, healing, blood building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.

[00:31:02.301 --> 00:31:04.082]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[00:31:04.582 --> 00:31:08.003]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:31:08.503 --> 00:31:09.163]  Let's update.
[00:31:09.683 --> 00:31:13.144]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:31:13.804 --> 00:31:17.525]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:31:18.206 --> 00:31:21.506]  Two years ago, the US dollar was worth 17% more than the Euro.
[00:31:22.027 --> 00:31:25.167]  Today, the US dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[00:31:25.568 --> 00:31:27.108]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:31:27.668 --> 00:31:29.649]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[00:31:31.004 --> 00:31:35.868]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:31:36.869 --> 00:31:39.031]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[00:31:39.431 --> 00:31:42.093]  There's a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:44.015]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.157]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:31:46.577 --> 00:31:48.559]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:51.061]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.

[00:32:20.141 --> 00:32:25.904]  We know the excitement that is created when a flower delivery person arrives in an office carrying a bouquet of flowers.
[00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:30.086]  The anticipation grows as everyone tries to guess who the lucky recipient is.
[00:32:30.426 --> 00:32:33.888]  And the joy and pride when the flowers are placed on her desk.
[00:32:34.108 --> 00:32:37.850]  We also know the envy of those at the desk as the flowers pass by.

[00:32:49.993 --> 00:32:50.193]  That's 1-800-627-0046.
[00:32:50.233 --> 00:32:51.834]  Or visit flowershop.com today.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.781]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:19.821 --> 00:33:21.381]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:22.082 --> 00:33:24.583]  back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:33:25.764 --> 00:33:36.509]  For those who just joined us, I was reading out of the Washington Post and the City Morning Herald about suicide genes designed into the biosphere to make the life cycle shut down in the environment.
[00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:42.933]  The Washington Post with genetically engineered mosquitoes to forcibly give you vaccines.
[00:33:44.393 --> 00:33:47.075]  Plants with vaccines in them so you can't escape it.
[00:33:47.135 --> 00:33:48.876]  Corn plants with HIV in them.
[00:33:49.676 --> 00:33:51.437]  And there's no regulation, no control.
[00:33:51.457 --> 00:33:52.317]  It's just being done.
[00:33:54.418 --> 00:33:59.281]  And it's the government, it's the big feedlots that allow feeding rotten meat to cows that cause the mad cow.
[00:33:59.301 --> 00:34:03.423]  Then they get more federal regulation that will be selectively enforced against good farmers and ranchers.
[00:34:04.258 --> 00:34:06.199]  It's all about centralization of control.
[00:34:06.259 --> 00:34:12.201]  We have corporate minutes from some of the big pharmacological companies where they've said they're going to take over the entire biosphere.
[00:34:12.221 --> 00:34:19.904]  They're going to put their genetics into everything, have it spread, then have world courts and federal courts rule that they own it if their genes are in it.
[00:34:21.845 --> 00:34:22.465]  It's amazing.
[00:34:24.346 --> 00:34:25.386]  It's just horrible.
[00:34:26.144 --> 00:34:33.106]  Now we'll take some calls and I'll get into secrecy reigns at Global Economic Forum, CEOs at Forum assess Al Qaeda as a business.
[00:34:33.546 --> 00:34:35.966]  They say the big new business is going to be the war on terror.
[00:34:36.026 --> 00:34:36.687]  How great it is.
[00:34:37.427 --> 00:34:40.188]  Bush's push for illegals creating anxious nation.
[00:34:40.248 --> 00:34:41.148]  Wait till you hear about this.
[00:34:41.868 --> 00:34:43.908]  They're getting record visits to psychiatrists.
[00:34:43.948 --> 00:34:44.809]  People who've never been to them.
[00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:46.109]  I love Bush.
[00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:47.089]  Why is he doing this to me?
[00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.170]  I have a personal relationship with him.
[00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:51.590]  I mean this is how mindless these neocons are.
[00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:52.631]  He's my buddy.
[00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:53.691]  Why'd he do this to me?
[00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:59.083]  Also, Washington soldiers' flights home still left unpaid.
[00:34:59.103 --> 00:35:00.563]  They're also having to pay for their meals.
[00:35:01.684 --> 00:35:01.924]  U.S.
[00:35:01.944 --> 00:35:06.086]  war on terror may spread to Syria, the federal report says, and more.
[00:35:06.426 --> 00:35:07.766]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[00:35:07.927 --> 00:35:09.147]  Elliot in New York.
[00:35:09.307 --> 00:35:10.468]  Elliot, you're on the air.
[00:35:10.708 --> 00:35:11.588]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:35:11.888 --> 00:35:12.208]  Welcome.
[00:35:12.228 --> 00:35:15.090]  I'd like to say it's a travesty what's happening to your website.
[00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.831]  It's being attacked every day, I noticed, down here in New York.
[00:35:20.152 --> 00:35:23.173]  Basically, I did what's called a ping, and I saw that it was wide open.
[00:35:24.102 --> 00:35:27.084]  It looks like somebody hacked in and basically opened up your proxy.
[00:35:28.804 --> 00:35:38.710]  Well, it's just ongoing, but, you know, the information's out there, and we're doing stuff to stop it, but, yeah, we researched it, and it's clearly very sophisticated attacks.
[00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:39.330]  It is.
[00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:43.412]  It's basically what happens is, it's not... It's over the Silverstein stuff.
[00:35:43.999 --> 00:35:49.322]  I mean, they don't like it that we got the video posted and all the documents that they blew up World Trade Center 7.
[00:35:50.003 --> 00:35:52.944]  I mean, you know, it scares them, and that's understandable.
[00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:54.025]  This is what they do, though.
[00:35:54.065 --> 00:35:55.026]  They don't do it themselves.
[00:35:55.726 --> 00:36:07.513]  They'll pose as a hacker in a forum, and they'll post something about your site negative, and these idiots won't look up themselves to see if what they said is true, and they'll just attack your site because they'll think you're a political person or whatever.
[00:36:08.012 --> 00:36:10.134]  Well, that happens in some cases, not normally.
[00:36:10.154 --> 00:36:12.136]  This is a little bit different than that.
[00:36:12.156 --> 00:36:12.976]  What's on your mind, sir?
[00:36:13.236 --> 00:36:17.800]  What's on my mind is basically New York City is really becoming locked down.
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.683]  I mean, anybody who lives here can see it getting worse and worse.
[00:36:22.224 --> 00:36:25.787]  I was on Park Avenue the other day, and you can see there wasn't even the soldiers.
[00:36:25.867 --> 00:36:28.629]  It was what we call the ESU, the SWAT team here.
[00:36:28.669 --> 00:36:32.773]  They were just standing on a street corner, guarding Park Avenue, basically.
[00:36:33.513 --> 00:36:35.395]  And, you know, I just would like to say that
[00:36:36.124 --> 00:36:38.707]  You know, your information is excellent.
[00:36:39.308 --> 00:36:40.529]  People need to buy your stuff.
[00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:42.871]  I love to buy your stuff.
[00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:44.353]  Your stuff is the best out there.
[00:36:44.393 --> 00:36:46.175]  You're the pioneer of all this good stuff.
[00:36:46.856 --> 00:36:47.997]  And that's basically it, sir.
[00:36:49.078 --> 00:36:52.141]  Alright, I appreciate your support and God bless you, my friend.
[00:36:53.349 --> 00:37:02.114]  Yeah, I mean, the border's wide open, but they have police in black uniforms and ski masks standing on the street corners everywhere, pointing MP5s at people.
[00:37:02.174 --> 00:37:03.455]  It's all about visibility.
[00:37:03.515 --> 00:37:04.516]  The Pentagon admits it.
[00:37:04.836 --> 00:37:10.159]  They are training us, General Eberhard has said it, the head of NORTHCOM, to accept the end of Posse Comitatus.
[00:37:10.719 --> 00:37:19.224]  Because they got stuff planned for the society as a whole that they know you're going to resist, that they know you're going to fight, that they know you're going to stand up to, even those of you that have gone along with this.
[00:37:19.505 --> 00:37:21.046]  So they've got to get it all in place now.
[00:37:22.756 --> 00:37:33.240]  There was a Associated Press photo in the Austin American Statesman on page C3 in the business section yesterday that really told a thousand words.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.421]  I say a picture can tell a thousand words, it told a million words.
[00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.402]  It was some
[00:37:39.222 --> 00:37:42.906]  Catholic priest and some folks out protesting.
[00:37:42.926 --> 00:37:49.471]  It was grocery store workers with the ongoing, I don't know, four or five month strike in California.
[00:37:50.112 --> 00:37:51.613]  And they were sitting there on the sidewalk.
[00:37:51.653 --> 00:37:53.035]  It was a no protest zone.
[00:37:53.275 --> 00:38:01.643]  They tell you, now you can protest in that baseball field five miles from or two miles from where the grocery store is, but you can't be on the street corner here.
[00:38:01.683 --> 00:38:02.283]  Sorry.
[00:38:02.543 --> 00:38:05.226]  You've got your First Amendment where no one can see you.
[00:38:06.198 --> 00:38:14.382]  And it's police in camouflage and in black uniforms with loaded MP5s and a loaded Mini Carbine M16s.
[00:38:15.203 --> 00:38:20.886]  And they're just standing there, grabbing people, arresting people who are peaceably sitting there on the sidewalk, taking them to jail.
[00:38:21.046 --> 00:38:28.230]  You know, troops in military outfits, that's what they are, arresting people who are sitting there on the sidewalk.
[00:38:28.948 --> 00:38:30.010]  And that's the new America.
[00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:41.410]  And the federal courts have said you can have 250 Bush supporters on a street corner, one person walks into a public street corner with a sign with them saying no blood for oil, they'll be arrested, they'll be federally charged and convicted.
[00:38:42.613 --> 00:38:48.775]  Or you can go to your designated free speech zone and the Secret Service said, hey, you can be a Bush supporter and stand on the street corner.
[00:38:49.095 --> 00:38:52.037]  If you've got an anti-Bush sign, that cannot be here where the media can see it.
[00:38:52.617 --> 00:38:53.637]  And they even said this on the record.
[00:38:53.997 --> 00:39:01.520]  Just right out in the open, into the First Amendment, and then you've got the pro-lifers with the signs that show dead babies, which is totally First Amendment.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.442]  You can stand there with a picture, you know, of a dead concentration camp victim.
[00:39:05.522 --> 00:39:07.783]  People have done that, and I think that's good to expose that.
[00:39:08.604 --> 00:39:09.945]  But no, none of it's a dead baby.
[00:39:10.965 --> 00:39:12.226]  We'll talk about that next hour.
[00:39:13.126 --> 00:39:15.007]  Justin, Justin, where are you calling us from?
[00:39:15.368 --> 00:39:16.228]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[00:39:16.268 --> 00:39:17.669]  I'm from Kansas City.
[00:39:17.929 --> 00:39:18.289]  Welcome.
[00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:19.410]  Thank you.
[00:39:19.450 --> 00:39:22.572]  Hey, I really appreciate what you've done, fighting this globalist puke.
[00:39:22.632 --> 00:39:25.613]  It just makes me sick to see all this stuff that they do.
[00:39:26.154 --> 00:39:30.076]  Basically, I wanted to comment on the genes that you're talking about in the seed.
[00:39:30.948 --> 00:39:38.111]  I was watching a show that's on tech TV called Conspiracies, and they always have two sides, you know, arguing.
[00:39:38.712 --> 00:39:45.435]  But they were talking about the kill thieves and how you're going to have to come back year after year to buy them from the big bio companies.
[00:39:45.975 --> 00:39:50.777]  And notice they put that on the show, like, and call it a conspiracy when that's public knowledge.
[00:39:51.097 --> 00:39:52.038]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:39:52.058 --> 00:39:53.078]  That's what makes me laugh.
[00:39:53.158 --> 00:39:59.701]  I'm like, and the funny thing is they can't ever get anybody from the biotech to come on the show and comment, but they got all these other people.
[00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:04.113]  Against them saying, you know, this is wrong, this is absolutely ludicrous to do this.
[00:40:04.674 --> 00:40:07.556]  And yet, they just, you know, it's unbelievable.
[00:40:10.199 --> 00:40:12.981]  Describe the tech TV show for us.
[00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:15.684]  It's on, I think it's on Sunday night.
[00:40:16.564 --> 00:40:18.986]  I got it statalized, so it's like a new thing.
[00:40:20.368 --> 00:40:21.409]  They talk about different things.
[00:40:21.449 --> 00:40:23.290]  The first one I caught was on the New World Order.
[00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:26.573]  And the guy, you know, they got one guy that said,
[00:40:27.955 --> 00:40:29.815]  Government's not taking over and blah blah blah.
[00:40:29.835 --> 00:40:34.816]  But then you got another guy and he's out in front of the UN saying, you know, this is exactly where it's all starting.
[00:40:34.836 --> 00:40:39.737]  This is where the world government is starting right here, right behind me in the building of the UN.
[00:40:40.317 --> 00:40:42.798]  And, uh, you know, they talk about different things and stuff.
[00:40:42.858 --> 00:40:50.739]  And, of course, the people that are trying to, uh, that are for the, you know, government can't ever back up anything and they basically don't want to.
[00:40:51.119 --> 00:40:54.240]  They got, you know, foolish things that are pretty much said.
[00:40:54.912 --> 00:40:55.393]  Pretty funny.
[00:40:55.973 --> 00:40:56.614]  Absolutely.
[00:40:56.634 --> 00:41:05.462]  You know, they'll have a TV show about FEMA and they'll go, conspiracy theory that there's executive orders that can put you in work camps and seize everything.
[00:41:05.482 --> 00:41:11.328]  And then they'll go to the executive order and admit it's real, but still it's a conspiracy to talk about it.
[00:41:11.368 --> 00:41:15.152]  I mean, I'm reading the Washington Post, the Sunday Morning Herald.
[00:41:16.059 --> 00:41:22.002]  About genetically engineered honeybees and silkworms and mosquitos and all this.
[00:41:22.063 --> 00:41:27.446]  And for ten years they've had goats that are part spider that create body armor out of their udders.
[00:41:28.206 --> 00:41:30.747]  And I had a guy walk up to me in a pizza place.
[00:41:30.767 --> 00:41:32.709]  I was getting a pizza and just said, you're a liar.
[00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:35.390]  There's no such thing when it's all over the news.
[00:41:35.410 --> 00:41:38.512]  It's just any way to deny what's happening.
[00:41:39.784 --> 00:41:42.906]  Any way to shuck and shirk their responsibility.
[00:41:43.026 --> 00:41:43.667]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:44.107 --> 00:41:45.548]  Good to hear from you, Justin.
[00:41:46.569 --> 00:41:47.610]  Let's talk to John.
[00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.131]  John, where are you calling us from?
[00:41:49.932 --> 00:41:51.933]  I'm calling from Michigan, Alex.
[00:41:52.233 --> 00:41:52.834]  Good to talk to you.
[00:41:52.874 --> 00:41:53.214]  Go ahead.
[00:41:53.835 --> 00:42:08.385]  Real quick, just to document what you were saying about them having that technology years ago, Don Scott, a research professor from Canada, he found all the Canadian documents where they had developed 100 million
[00:42:09.540 --> 00:42:13.583]  Mosquitoes every month for distributing mycoplasma in the air.
[00:42:14.003 --> 00:42:17.345]  And he had him on the air and he's been in the mainstream news in Canada.
[00:42:17.805 --> 00:42:28.132]  It is an admitted public document that for decades they've been putting soft kill bio-weapons in mosquitoes and releasing them.
[00:42:28.692 --> 00:42:31.574]  That's on EagleFoundation.net, Alex.
[00:42:33.475 --> 00:42:34.236]  Alex?
[00:42:34.276 --> 00:42:38.198]  Yes sir, and now here's the Washington Post telling you how great it is.
[00:42:38.218 --> 00:42:38.899]  What do you think about it?
[00:42:39.565 --> 00:42:42.727]  Well, I think it's just satanic.
[00:42:42.867 --> 00:42:43.768]  It's sickening.
[00:42:43.788 --> 00:42:46.989]  We're up here on the 45th parallel.
[00:42:47.009 --> 00:42:48.170]  We're constantly being sprained.
[00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.611]  I talked to Don Scott.
[00:42:49.631 --> 00:42:50.451]  He's in his 80s.
[00:42:51.012 --> 00:42:53.493]  And he told me that they're putting it in the chemtrails, too.
[00:42:54.214 --> 00:42:56.175]  And we have MS here rampant.
[00:42:56.575 --> 00:42:58.336]  It's around the 45th around the world.
[00:42:58.536 --> 00:42:59.717]  And it's just despicable.
[00:43:01.866 --> 00:43:03.647]  And they have the Congressional Bills.
[00:43:03.667 --> 00:43:09.252]  They even admit on the show, Atmospheres on the Weather Channel, that, oh, we're manipulating the weather and spraying you, but don't worry about it.
[00:43:09.272 --> 00:43:10.633]  You're still weird if you talk about it.
[00:43:11.553 --> 00:43:12.294]  Amen, Alex.
[00:43:12.374 --> 00:43:12.714]  Thank you.
[00:43:12.754 --> 00:43:13.214]  God bless.
[00:43:13.315 --> 00:43:14.576]  Yeah, thank you, John.
[00:43:14.836 --> 00:43:16.797]  Let's talk to Jeff in Washington State.
[00:43:16.837 --> 00:43:17.518]  Jeff, go ahead.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:21.761]  Good to talk to you today, Jeff.
[00:43:24.003 --> 00:43:25.243]  Okay, Jeff's not there.
[00:43:26.144 --> 00:43:27.425]  Ray in Colorado.
[00:43:27.485 --> 00:43:28.306]  Ray, you're on the air.
[00:43:28.366 --> 00:43:28.706]  Welcome.
[00:43:29.427 --> 00:43:29.787]  Hello.
[00:43:30.387 --> 00:43:30.948]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:43:32.263 --> 00:43:33.444]  Uh, couple things.
[00:43:34.405 --> 00:43:46.915]  When our leader said that he wanted to place a man on Mars, I kind of read that as though they want to place up a man as the god of war since Mars is a war planet.
[00:43:48.207 --> 00:43:50.729]  Well, you know, I just stick to stuff I can prove.
[00:43:50.749 --> 00:44:00.017]  I mean, the world leaders are the occult, but mainly NASA's a big black ops cash machine where very little of the money actually goes to space exploration.
[00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:02.399]  The rest goes to militarizing space.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:10.286]  You know, it's a more sophisticated scam than $500 hammers and $700 toilet seats at the Pentagon.
[00:44:10.586 --> 00:44:14.910]  What I'd really like to get across is a little bit of strengthening for everybody is that
[00:44:15.885 --> 00:44:18.285]  You know, I've talked to a congressman's wife.
[00:44:18.366 --> 00:44:22.006]  I said, did you feel like you're an individual on your own when your husband went to Washington?
[00:44:22.926 --> 00:44:24.387]  And she said, of course I did.
[00:44:24.407 --> 00:44:29.028]  And I said, did you guys receive threats at times about how he should vote?
[00:44:29.368 --> 00:44:30.448]  She said, of course we did.
[00:44:31.408 --> 00:44:34.449]  I said, did that affect how he votes?
[00:44:34.929 --> 00:44:35.949]  She said, of course it did.
[00:44:35.969 --> 00:44:39.830]  And I'd like to point the finger at everybody out here, including myself.
[00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:45.431]  Because the responsibility to protect them was their next door neighbors.
[00:44:46.092 --> 00:44:47.172]  We're not watching over them.
[00:44:48.433 --> 00:44:50.754]  People have lost contact with their next-door neighbors.
[00:44:51.574 --> 00:44:52.715]  Well, you know, that's a big part of it.
[00:44:52.755 --> 00:44:54.115]  Our families are breaking up.
[00:44:54.175 --> 00:44:55.756]  People don't know who their neighbors are.
[00:44:56.156 --> 00:44:57.497]  We don't have block parties.
[00:44:57.557 --> 00:44:58.577]  We don't go to church.
[00:44:58.717 --> 00:45:02.979]  Or our church just tells us to love the Patriot Act and love world government.
[00:45:03.379 --> 00:45:04.679]  You're absolutely right.
[00:45:04.699 --> 00:45:11.502]  So if everybody concentrates on any good deed they can do for their next-door neighbors, consider their neighbor a brick.
[00:45:12.162 --> 00:45:13.383]  And the good deed is mortar.
[00:45:14.437 --> 00:45:17.259]  The better the deeds, the stronger the mortar that will hold them together.
[00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:27.005]  Because you have CIA, FBI, ATF, police officers, you have homicide detectives who are all compromised because they can't protect their loved ones at home and go to work.
[00:45:27.045 --> 00:45:27.725]  And that's our job.
[00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:29.786]  That's our job.
[00:45:31.627 --> 00:45:34.869]  You spread, let's say you have a million bricks for a refuge.
[00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:39.132]  And you spread them all over the city, which is how we've been taught to do.
[00:45:39.152 --> 00:45:40.873]  That's not a refuge.
[00:45:40.953 --> 00:45:41.894]  It's got to be door to door.
[00:45:43.257 --> 00:45:43.718]  You're right.
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:46.103]  We've got to create community again.
[00:45:46.123 --> 00:45:47.326]  Thanks for the call, Ray.
[00:45:47.346 --> 00:45:47.847]  Great points.
[00:45:48.688 --> 00:45:50.392]  Now, Jeff in Washington is there.
[00:45:50.452 --> 00:45:51.093]  Jeff, go ahead.
[00:45:53.731 --> 00:46:03.399]  You're talking about that genetic modified food and the animals that they're doing now.
[00:46:03.459 --> 00:46:04.660]  It's just crazy.
[00:46:05.361 --> 00:46:10.765]  I travel across the United States in my job and I see this everywhere.
[00:46:10.785 --> 00:46:12.486]  Basically in the Midwest.
[00:46:12.546 --> 00:46:20.973]  I was over in South Dakota last year and about every third crop had these big signs saying test product and all this.
[00:46:22.174 --> 00:46:36.199]  And they have the gall to say that their food that they're growing sitting right next to this other farmer's is not cross-pollinating and contaminating the other species.
[00:46:36.279 --> 00:46:37.059]  And it's crazy!
[00:46:37.159 --> 00:46:41.141]  And then Monsanto, the federal court that rules on genetic engineering is in St.
[00:46:41.181 --> 00:46:41.481]  Louis.
[00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:42.701]  They openly own the court.
[00:46:43.121 --> 00:46:47.683]  And when they spread their genetics into your crop, then your crop can't produce seeds anymore.
[00:46:47.963 --> 00:46:50.744]  They come grab plants off your crop with no warrant.
[00:46:51.204 --> 00:47:00.558]  They have retired FBI agents that work for them, hundreds of them, and then they criminally go after you and end up fining you and taking your property, even when you prove that they contaminated you!
[00:47:00.578 --> 00:47:00.658]  Yeah!
[00:47:01.259 --> 00:47:05.665]  Yeah, they're doing that far up north right now as we speak up in Canada!
[00:47:06.348 --> 00:47:13.013]  Well, Percy Smyser has been public, but I've talked to hundreds of farmers that are listeners that it's happened to.
[00:47:13.313 --> 00:47:16.316]  They have the seed purchase records.
[00:47:17.296 --> 00:47:19.918]  They bought good, non-genetically modified seeds.
[00:47:20.459 --> 00:47:22.000]  They never bought from Monsanto.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.643]  Monsanto will come on a place where there's 500,000 corn stalks.
[00:47:26.964 --> 00:47:29.726]  They'll find one plant that has some of their genetics in it.
[00:47:30.186 --> 00:47:30.506]  Oh, it is.
[00:47:30.547 --> 00:47:30.687]  It is.
[00:47:30.747 --> 00:47:33.910]  And they're doing it about every third to fifth farm all the way across the United States.
[00:47:52.210 --> 00:48:08.354]  Well in Canada they hired the retired Mounties and they caught the Mounties going in the ditches and throwing out genetically modified seeds right up against the property lines so they don't even have to buy property and plant or lease property and plant to contaminate.
[00:48:08.574 --> 00:48:10.135]  They throw it into the ditches.
[00:48:10.875 --> 00:48:13.215]  I mean it is, it is folks, it is a takeover.
[00:48:13.515 --> 00:48:14.696]  Well what's the bottom line on this?
[00:48:14.736 --> 00:48:15.616]  What are they trying to prove?
[00:48:16.674 --> 00:48:21.838]  They want their genetics into every plant, and then they can own ownership of everything.
[00:48:22.319 --> 00:48:25.901]  And they want to engineer plants, which they've already done, so they do not produce seeds.
[00:48:26.182 --> 00:48:28.183]  So you've got to keep going back to Monsanto.
[00:48:29.584 --> 00:48:31.566]  It is a monopoly being designed.
[00:48:32.426 --> 00:48:35.669]  Ah, yeah, that's what they'd be up to, and now they own everything.
[00:48:35.789 --> 00:48:42.514]  And the UN says, we use food as a weapon in their 97 Food Summit, and we do not apologize for it.
[00:48:42.794 --> 00:48:47.797]  And yesterday, North Korea was bragging, and we got the photos of little skinny dying babies.
[00:48:47.837 --> 00:48:49.699]  It just makes me cry, literally cry.
[00:48:49.719 --> 00:48:52.641]  My wife was crying over this yesterday when I came back into the office.
[00:48:52.661 --> 00:48:53.461]  She's the webmaster.
[00:48:54.082 --> 00:48:56.844]  And they're just murdering millions with this.
[00:48:57.164 --> 00:48:58.825]  This is what the globalists are all about.
[00:49:00.134 --> 00:49:01.115]  Yeah, what are we going to do?
[00:49:01.615 --> 00:49:11.845]  I mean, I listen to you all the time, Alex, and you say, you know, buy your tapes and get it out there in front of people, but even so, I mean, how much blood is there going to be spilled on this?
[00:49:12.446 --> 00:49:14.408]  I mean, how are we ever going to stop these people?
[00:49:14.468 --> 00:49:18.712]  Well, sir, most people still don't even know about this, so we've still got the job of waking people up.
[00:49:19.592 --> 00:49:22.194]  But violence isn't the way to go.
[00:49:22.254 --> 00:49:23.355]  They want that to happen.
[00:49:23.575 --> 00:49:27.017]  The globalists carry out their own violence to then blame on people.
[00:49:27.478 --> 00:49:32.401]  So we need to expose, number one, that they're the terrorists, and then show their control grid they're putting in place.
[00:49:32.881 --> 00:49:46.710]  The entire cashless society, the biometrics, the national ID cards, the surveillance systems, the control of the biosphere, the land-grabbing that's going on, the gun-grabbing that's going on, getting rid of our borders and plotting our sovereignty.
[00:49:46.991 --> 00:49:48.932]  We're being attacked from every angle.
[00:49:50.305 --> 00:49:52.626]  Yeah, there's absolutely no doubt.
[00:49:52.706 --> 00:49:54.507]  I mean, you have a voice right there.
[00:49:54.967 --> 00:49:59.508]  Two days ago, flat saying, we're going to just, you know, become a world sphere all the way.
[00:49:59.949 --> 00:50:04.910]  All the Americas are going to just become a... You know, I mean, this is what we're going to do.
[00:50:04.971 --> 00:50:05.571]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:05.691 --> 00:50:06.451]  That'll let you go.
[00:50:07.772 --> 00:50:09.012]  And here it is, folks.
[00:50:09.032 --> 00:50:11.893]  This is out of the Associated Press, Switzerland.
[00:50:12.573 --> 00:50:15.414]  The CEOs at Forum assess Al-Qaeda as a business.
[00:50:15.875 --> 00:50:18.195]  They vote Switzerland, and one of the more pro...
[00:50:20.489 --> 00:50:23.633]  Provocative sessions at this year's World Economic Forum.
[00:50:23.673 --> 00:50:24.954]  Counterterrorism experts and U.S.
[00:50:24.994 --> 00:50:31.641]  Chief Executives yesterday looked at terrorism through the prism of business, as an enterprise with cash flow, employees, and even marketing.
[00:50:32.381 --> 00:50:33.623]  Well, that's how it's being sold to you.
[00:50:34.043 --> 00:50:37.447]  I saw Ridge a year and a half ago say, to have a job, to live your life.
[00:50:37.887 --> 00:50:40.910]  We're all going to have, through our driver's license, security level clearances.
[00:50:40.930 --> 00:50:42.652]  To have any job, you'll be federally controlled.
[00:50:43.312 --> 00:50:49.016]  And it's going to be big business and he sat there and promised lots of money for everyone and how great this new economy will be.
[00:50:49.076 --> 00:50:52.158]  The new prison grid slave economy.
[00:50:52.718 --> 00:50:56.961]  The military industrial complex said, hey, we might as well just take over and be the bosses.
[00:50:57.441 --> 00:50:58.742]  That's the norm in history.
[00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:04.493]  We've all heard the ads for lower prices on airfare and hotel.
[00:51:04.513 --> 00:51:06.495]  Oh yeah, the dot-coms are endless.
[00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:12.319]  Cheaperhotels.com, SaveOnYourRentalCard.com, HalfPriceAirlineTickets.com.
[00:51:12.379 --> 00:51:18.203]  Problem is, by the time you get done planning your vacation, you've visited dozens of websites and spent hours and hours trying to save money.

[00:52:00.327 --> 00:52:01.928]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:52:02.288 --> 00:52:08.032]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:52:08.293 --> 00:52:13.416]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:52:13.776 --> 00:52:23.043]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:52:23.403 --> 00:52:28.344]  It's rechargeable 8 lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:52:28.664 --> 00:52:32.685]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:52:32.885 --> 00:52:37.626]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:52:38.026 --> 00:52:44.008]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:52:44.268 --> 00:52:45.128]  Get the Berkey Light
[00:52:45.248 --> 00:52:53.292]  The standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:53.492 --> 00:52:57.013]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:57.574 --> 00:52:58.654]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.175 --> 00:53:04.497]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:53:04.697 --> 00:53:09.039]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:53:11.561 --> 00:53:13.662]  This disaster for the New World Order.
[00:53:13.682 --> 00:53:16.603]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:53:16.803 --> 00:53:21.024]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:53:21.104 --> 00:53:28.026]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:53:28.146 --> 00:53:30.147]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:53:30.427 --> 00:53:40.936]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:53:41.156 --> 00:53:46.540]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:54:07.659 --> 00:54:10.501]  From 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight, we're here live.
[00:54:12.543 --> 00:54:24.333]  And my website has been under attack now for a week, since we started going public with Larry Silverstein, the owner of the WTCs, saying that they blew up World Trade Center 7.
[00:54:24.913 --> 00:54:30.778]  Our backup website is Infowars.net, and you can also get through to our secure online shopping cart there.
[00:54:31.588 --> 00:54:40.412]  That never goes down, and get the videos, the books, the films, all the t-shirts, the bumper stickers, the information warfare tools.
[00:54:41.533 --> 00:54:54.719]  And please get the videos, whether it's Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, or 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Cherub, Matrix of Evil, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, go to InfoWars.com.
[00:54:57.517 --> 00:55:01.939]  Go to www.PresentPlanet.com and link through to the Secure Online Shopping Cart and get the films.
[00:55:01.999 --> 00:55:03.000]  Get them out to people.
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:03.900]  Make the copies.
[00:55:04.300 --> 00:55:06.001]  It is having an effect.
[00:55:06.321 --> 00:55:07.862]  We are fighting the globalists.
[00:55:07.922 --> 00:55:12.044]  If we weren't doing this, things would be much worse right now already.
[00:55:12.064 --> 00:55:15.266]  The videos are all over two hours long, $25.95 apiece.
[00:55:15.286 --> 00:55:17.107]  If you order three or more of any
[00:55:20.264 --> 00:55:23.886]  Of the ten videos, they dropped down to twenty dollars a piece.
[00:55:24.366 --> 00:55:31.088]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, about September 11th, another government-sponsored terror event, is only twelve dollars, over two hundred pages long.
[00:55:32.128 --> 00:55:34.969]  So please call toll-free to get the books, the films, the tapes.
[00:55:34.989 --> 00:55:35.710]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:55:35.730 --> 00:55:35.990]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:55:48.544 --> 00:55:53.607]  Or you can simply write to me, and I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:55:54.227 --> 00:55:59.290]  So again, that number is 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:56:15.623 --> 00:56:18.185]  CEOs at Forum assess Al-Qaeda as a business.
[00:56:18.425 --> 00:56:25.470]  And they go on saying that he added it before going into terrorism, so Bin Laden's training was in economics and public administration.
[00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:29.512]  And they said that fighting Al-Qaeda is going to be a good world business.
[00:56:30.073 --> 00:56:36.817]  And John Ashcroft is the center of talks there in Davos, Switzerland.
[00:56:38.579 --> 00:56:39.800]  About how it's a big business.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.921]  And I saw Ridge say this.
[00:56:40.981 --> 00:56:42.042]  It's a big celebration.
[00:56:42.082 --> 00:56:48.867]  I mean, three days after 9-11, Bush goes to the CIA, stands in the middle of the Eagle in the foyer.
[00:56:49.728 --> 00:57:00.135]  The CIA, some of the top people, hundreds of them, stand around him and they all do a round of applause and clap and cry and just keep clapping and smiling and just celebrating.
[00:57:00.896 --> 00:57:02.637]  This is how they're going to take over our lives.
[00:57:02.697 --> 00:57:03.418]  It's real simple.
[00:57:04.002 --> 00:57:27.270]  All the corporate crime, all the corruption, walled off under national security, all the takeovers, all the cash, all the private contracts, the $1.2 trillion missing from the Pentagon, all the looting of the economy, all the bid rigging, no bids allowed for Halliburton, record opium supplies pouring out of Afghanistan, all the CIA child kidnapping and white slavery rings.
[00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:29.611]  Just, it's business as great, man!
[00:57:29.631 --> 00:57:30.731]  They're the ruling class.
[00:57:31.031 --> 00:57:33.232]  They're blowing stuff up to scare us into submission.
[00:57:33.792 --> 00:57:36.293]  And they plan to keep it up and just not let up.
[00:57:36.913 --> 00:57:40.634]  And until we have a mass awakening to this horror, it's going to get worse.
[00:57:40.674 --> 00:57:42.175]  And your standard of living is going to go down.
[00:57:42.475 --> 00:57:45.096]  And your children are going to be delivered into the hands of total tyranny.
[00:57:47.176 --> 00:57:48.717]  So I hope everybody thinks about that.
[00:57:48.737 --> 00:57:53.859]  I hope you think about it long and hard, folks, because it is so sad what's happened to this country.
[00:57:53.899 --> 00:57:57.700]  We'll get to these loaded phones here pretty early.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.241]  We're going to get our first guest on here in about ten minutes.
[00:58:02.153 --> 00:58:03.734]  Talking about the First Amendment.
[00:58:05.274 --> 00:58:08.555]  Pro-life groups try to have signs of dead babies out on the streets.
[00:58:09.215 --> 00:58:10.596]  Now, you're arrested for that now.
[00:58:10.616 --> 00:58:13.257]  It's just incredible.
[00:58:13.477 --> 00:58:19.439]  But again, PBS and the Discovery Channel can show piles of dead people killed by the Nazis, and they should!
[00:58:19.919 --> 00:58:24.160]  We should see that and know what evil's all about, but you don't show a dead baby in this country.
[00:58:24.180 --> 00:58:25.941]  You don't expose Hitler in this country.
[00:58:26.521 --> 00:58:28.481]  You don't expose the 45 million dead.
[00:58:29.282 --> 00:58:30.122]  More than Hitler killed.
[00:58:31.505 --> 00:58:32.967]  Almost as many as Stalin killed.
[00:58:34.289 --> 00:58:36.472]  You see, Hooks, we're going to the bottom of the pit.
[00:58:36.912 --> 00:58:38.935]  We've got to be honest about that to get our country back.
[00:58:39.756 --> 00:58:43.962]  We'll come back, take some calls quickly, then get to our guests who take more calls and a ton of other news.
[00:58:44.743 --> 00:58:47.707]  This Friday's show is absolutely jam-packed with key infos, so stay with us.
[00:58:51.633 --> 00:58:54.894]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:58:54.954 --> 00:58:59.116]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:58:59.376 --> 00:59:02.158]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:59:02.358 --> 00:59:04.759]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:59:04.959 --> 00:59:13.602]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:59:13.783 --> 00:59:15.143]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:59:15.323 --> 00:59:19.445]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:59:19.445 --> 00:59:20.145]  We're good to go!
[00:59:48.624 --> 00:59:54.865]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:57.406 --> 00:59:58.086]  Big Brother.
[00:59:58.726 --> 00:59:59.786]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:00.486 --> 01:00:01.646]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:01.666 --> 01:00:03.087]  You want answers?
[01:00:03.807 --> 01:00:04.747]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.407 --> 01:00:09.048]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.568 --> 01:00:13.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:20.771]  Alright, we're updating here in the next 10 minutes.
[01:00:20.971 --> 01:00:23.652]  Infowars.net with the latest news and information.
[01:00:25.493 --> 01:00:27.173]  And we're about to go straight back to your calls.
[01:00:27.213 --> 01:00:31.715]  Then we've got one of the head folks at Operation Rescue West.
[01:00:34.116 --> 01:00:39.418]  They've been arrested for simply having signs, pictures of dead babies in public places.
[01:00:40.467 --> 01:00:42.447]  And the total violation of the First Amendment.
[01:00:42.488 --> 01:00:47.129]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls to Ron and Tim and H.W.
[01:00:47.289 --> 01:00:50.890]  and many, many others that are patiently holding.
[01:00:51.490 --> 01:00:53.050]  Go ahead, Ron, quickly.
[01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:54.150]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:58.731]  Alex, I heard the most remarkable thing on Limbaugh's broadcast within the last hour.
[01:00:59.412 --> 01:01:09.374]  He said that the Mars rover went down for a 24-hour period because it was actually transmitting some type of encoded information about mineral wealth, such as oil, back to Halliburton
[01:01:09.949 --> 01:01:15.231]  Before it came back up and went online with NASA.
[01:01:16.071 --> 01:01:17.211]  That guy actually said that.
[01:01:17.351 --> 01:01:18.852]  Was he probably being sarcastic?
[01:01:19.212 --> 01:01:19.952]  I don't think so.
[01:01:19.972 --> 01:01:21.112]  He didn't come across that way.
[01:01:23.393 --> 01:01:27.834]  I have the 1997 documents that were in the Houston Chronicle last week.
[01:01:28.294 --> 01:01:29.154]  Halliburton in 1997 has been
[01:01:31.235 --> 01:01:35.636]  They're gonna be given billions of dollars to, quote, test drilling systems from Mars and the Moon.
[01:01:35.956 --> 01:01:37.477]  Just again, a total cash cow.
[01:01:37.897 --> 01:01:39.317]  See, this is the way the scams work.
[01:01:39.337 --> 01:01:41.698]  They'll build a piece of junk that's never even to be used.
[01:01:42.038 --> 01:01:44.319]  They don't even spend any money building the piece of junk.
[01:01:44.559 --> 01:01:46.119]  Then they get billions of dollars for it.
[01:01:46.139 --> 01:01:47.320]  So that's the real scam.
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.880]  The real oil is the money here on this planet.
[01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:58.463]  It's like double charging for, uh... It's like double charging for, you know, fuel in Iraq to the troops.
[01:02:00.117 --> 01:02:07.301]  Well, I wonder, you know, because, like I said, he didn't... Not that I trust Limbaugh, but it was kind of a strange remark, and he did make that.
[01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:11.283]  Okay, well, I really don't want to live on air, just keep talking about other talk show hosts.
[01:02:11.303 --> 01:02:12.144]  What's on your mind, Ron?
[01:02:12.704 --> 01:02:13.685]  Okay, another thing, too.
[01:02:14.145 --> 01:02:22.510]  You've spoken many, many times about vaccines and inoculations, and, of course, you and your guests indicated that in many of them, there's a component of mercury.
[01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:26.632]  Now, last night, I was watching the History Channel about Ivan the Terrible.
[01:02:27.338 --> 01:02:35.281]  They said he was probably homicidally violent because he was taking medicines for pain that had mercury.
[01:02:35.622 --> 01:02:36.042]  Yes.
[01:02:36.562 --> 01:02:45.486]  Do you think the reason we have such a spiking crime from a certain generation on is because from a certain generation on we've all received these inoculations with mercury
[01:02:46.132 --> 01:02:56.638]  And maybe some people, or whatever, weaker, or have less resistance to it, and that's why we have more criminal-minded people, or more criminal... Hundreds of times the safe level, and look how violent toddlers are now.
[01:02:56.678 --> 01:02:57.658]  They weren't like that in the past.
[01:02:57.678 --> 01:02:59.119]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:59.139 --> 01:03:00.740]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:01.480]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:03:04.182 --> 01:03:05.042]  Alex, always a pleasure.
[01:03:05.963 --> 01:03:06.223]  Thanks.
[01:03:06.303 --> 01:03:06.623]  Go ahead.
[01:03:07.443 --> 01:03:09.164]  I just want to tell you a couple things real quick.
[01:03:09.204 --> 01:03:09.765]  I'll be brief.
[01:03:10.125 --> 01:03:15.648]  I've been driving around with www.infowars.com on my back window, and I get a lot of thumbs up and hits from people.
[01:03:16.115 --> 01:03:18.177]  You've inspired me to start my own organization.
[01:03:18.557 --> 01:03:23.181]  I'm calling it Truth Teaching and Researching United States Treasonous Hierarchy.
[01:03:23.782 --> 01:03:28.226]  And another thing about your website, what I was able to do is sort of back into it.
[01:03:28.466 --> 01:03:40.016]  What I will do is I'll mail myself pages from your website, and then when I can't get through it doing a search or from my bookmarks, what I'll do is just go to one of those pages, call it back up, and I can get in that way.
[01:03:40.036 --> 01:03:43.199]  Because we can't listen to you on the radio up here where we are, but we listen to you over the computer.
[01:03:44.744 --> 01:03:45.584]  Well, fantastic!
[01:03:45.644 --> 01:03:46.984]  Well, I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:03:47.004 --> 01:03:47.825]  What else is on your mind?
[01:03:47.865 --> 01:03:49.065]  I wanted to point out a couple things.
[01:03:49.105 --> 01:04:02.087]  I was reading about how the... You know the ones that get into CIA mind control and they're abused from children and stuff like that, and they claim that they're sort of like a droopy left eye that is a result of all of these people.
[01:04:02.107 --> 01:04:09.168]  And I look around on the media and I see a lot of people reporting the news and a lot of people they're reporting about all seem to have this same droopy left eye.
[01:04:09.188 --> 01:04:10.468]  It's very, very interesting.
[01:04:11.609 --> 01:04:13.529]  There are some... People can take a look out for that.
[01:04:14.292 --> 01:04:14.552]  Sure.
[01:04:14.692 --> 01:04:16.534]  Well, there are some signs of that.
[01:04:17.234 --> 01:04:20.096]  And the Mind Control programs are public and admitted, folks.
[01:04:20.697 --> 01:04:24.500]  Now, this is admitted stuff that's been going on for a long time, and it's very, very scary.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:26.741]  Quick thing about the prisons.
[01:04:26.841 --> 01:04:27.922]  I think it's at Wackenhut.
[01:04:28.102 --> 01:04:30.044]  They've been privatized to do most of the prisons.
[01:04:30.104 --> 01:04:30.264]  Yes.
[01:04:30.604 --> 01:04:42.533]  I was talking to someone that had the unfortunate experience of dealing with one of those places, and he told me that Bob Barker, the talk show, the game show host, has soap and shampoo that the prisons buy and give to all the prisoners in there.
[01:04:45.431 --> 01:04:45.952]  Amazing.
[01:04:46.573 --> 01:04:48.756]  Hey, thanks for your call and thanks for all you're doing.
[01:04:48.796 --> 01:04:49.638]  We'll be back with our guest.
[01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:56.352]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:56.632 --> 01:05:00.134]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[01:05:56.003 --> 01:05:57.284]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:06:22.136 --> 01:06:24.877]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:06:25.197 --> 01:06:28.378]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.238]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:06:48.464 --> 01:06:50.525]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:06:51.218 --> 01:06:54.039]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:06:54.179 --> 01:06:55.000]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.421]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:06:58.621 --> 01:07:04.284]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:07:04.424 --> 01:07:07.445]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:07:07.705 --> 01:07:11.989]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:07:12.169 --> 01:07:14.091]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:07:14.211 --> 01:07:21.277]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:07:21.457 --> 01:07:23.919]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:07:24.219 --> 01:07:28.542]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:07:28.822 --> 01:07:30.583]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement.
[01:07:30.683 --> 01:07:32.784]  And after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:07:32.964 --> 01:07:35.425]  That was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since.
[01:07:35.465 --> 01:07:38.167]  And today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:07:38.347 --> 01:07:38.887]  Side effects?
[01:07:39.047 --> 01:07:41.329]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now too.
[01:07:41.489 --> 01:07:42.970]  Call Kliscott Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:43.190]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:44.751]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:07:44.771 --> 01:07:45.251]  It worked for me.
[01:07:57.542 --> 01:07:58.162]  Big Brother.
[01:07:58.843 --> 01:07:59.883]  Mainstream media.
[01:08:00.604 --> 01:08:01.725]  Government cover-ups.
[01:08:02.365 --> 01:08:03.186]  You want answers?
[01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:04.867]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:05.508 --> 01:08:09.151]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.691 --> 01:08:13.814]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:16.776 --> 01:08:23.442]  PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, VirginUtah.com, they're all up.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:29.143]  Troy Newman is the president of OperationRescue.org.
[01:08:31.044 --> 01:08:34.986]  And pro-life websites have been getting hacked and taken down around the country, folks.
[01:08:35.566 --> 01:08:44.491]  They are putting directories into all the big corporations and libraries, blocking out patriot, real conservative websites.
[01:08:45.231 --> 01:08:47.272]  The neocon websites don't ever have a problem.
[01:08:48.293 --> 01:08:51.934]  We're talking to Troy Newman and WorldNetDailyStory on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:59.956]  From yesterday, he was arrested by two police out in Bel Air, California.
[01:08:59.976 --> 01:09:01.958]  You can see a picture of the truck there on the website.
[01:09:01.978 --> 01:09:04.080]  It has a picture of a dead baby on it.
[01:09:05.063 --> 01:09:07.065]  Now, I have friends here in Austin who've been arrested.
[01:09:07.385 --> 01:09:15.253]  They'll stand, you know, a hundred yards from the abortion clinic, the abortuary, and the police will just come up and arrest them and say, you can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[01:09:15.273 --> 01:09:23.321]  And we've got video of them breaking Catholic priest arms and macing women with babies in their arms, who are peaceably sitting on the sidewalk.
[01:09:24.683 --> 01:09:25.964]  And it's just horrible.
[01:09:27.037 --> 01:09:29.278]  And they're taking the free speech of everybody now.
[01:09:29.318 --> 01:09:32.319]  The liberals, the conservatives, it's just happening everywhere.
[01:09:32.359 --> 01:09:38.462]  Yesterday there was that AP photo, our local paper, of guys with machine guns out in California.
[01:09:39.202 --> 01:09:50.587]  The police arresting people off the sidewalk who had picket signs protesting during a big strike with the grocery stores.
[01:09:51.232 --> 01:09:52.073]  This is the new image.
[01:09:52.153 --> 01:09:55.697]  People in militarized outfits arresting peaceable protesters.
[01:09:56.157 --> 01:09:58.399]  But this isn't just a pro-life issue.
[01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.241]  It's a First Amendment issue.
[01:10:01.523 --> 01:10:05.426]  And two weeks ago we had the federal court ruling in North Carolina
[01:10:06.448 --> 01:10:14.652]  Where a liberal had a sign that said, no blood for oil, amongst 250 plus Bush supporters on a public sidewalk.
[01:10:14.712 --> 01:10:18.694]  And the Secret Service walked over and said, arrest him, no anti-Bush signs.
[01:10:19.074 --> 01:10:20.655]  And they arrested him and took him to jail.
[01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:21.355]  And he was convicted.
[01:10:21.395 --> 01:10:22.836]  They said, the judges, we don't care.
[01:10:23.196 --> 01:10:24.076]  We do what we want now.
[01:10:24.557 --> 01:10:25.717]  This is the new America.
[01:10:26.958 --> 01:10:29.819]  So I guess the terrorists attacked us because they hated our freedom.
[01:10:30.319 --> 01:10:33.701]  And so Bush killed our freedom so that the terrorists would be happy, I guess.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:37.940]  Across the board, this is happening.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.261]  Troy Newman, thank you for coming on the show.
[01:10:40.721 --> 01:10:43.822]  Tell us about your organization, your trucks, what you're doing, and what happened.
[01:10:44.362 --> 01:10:44.882]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:10:44.902 --> 01:10:46.642]  Well, that's a big bite to chew on.
[01:10:46.842 --> 01:10:53.824]  We're a pro-life organization that started about 15 years ago with the sole purpose of ending child killing in America.
[01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:58.625]  We're doing it primarily these days through education efforts by
[01:10:59.409 --> 01:11:02.071]  By bringing a window into the abortion clinic.
[01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:05.855]  You know, years ago we said, if wombs had windows, there'd be no abortion.
[01:11:06.055 --> 01:11:06.716]  You ever hear that one?
[01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:13.922]  Yes, and now they have the high-powered color... I'm losing my mind here...
[01:11:15.223 --> 01:11:17.104]  The tests they do where you can see the baby?
[01:11:17.425 --> 01:11:19.226]  Right, yeah, the big 3D sonograms.
[01:11:19.306 --> 01:11:20.567]  Yes, the 3D sonograms.
[01:11:20.747 --> 01:11:22.468]  The 4D, yeah, there's motion to it as well.
[01:11:22.588 --> 01:11:29.153]  Yeah, 4D, and now the majority of men and women, the numbers have reversed the last 10 years, are now against abortion.
[01:11:29.453 --> 01:11:32.875]  Young people are against abortion even more than their parents now.
[01:11:32.915 --> 01:11:33.296]  Go ahead.
[01:11:33.396 --> 01:11:33.956]  It's incredible.
[01:11:33.976 --> 01:11:39.100]  72% of the young people nowadays, according to a recent Gallup poll, consider themselves to be pro-life.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.443]  Well, we took that slogan a step further.
[01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:43.846]  If the wombs had windows, there'd be no abortion.
[01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:47.351]  We've got a window into the abortion clinic, and I'm telling you, it's not a pretty sight.
[01:11:48.055 --> 01:11:51.596]  Every abortion kills a little baby, and it's a bloody, gory mess.
[01:11:52.196 --> 01:11:57.137]  I hate to show it, I hate to talk about it, but that's the truth, and we should never shy away from the truth.
[01:11:57.357 --> 01:12:05.979]  Well, sir, it's a gory, horrible mess when I watch Discovery Channel, and a pile of dead Jews and others are being rammed into a pit by the Nazis.
[01:12:06.319 --> 01:12:10.920]  We see their naked bodies, men, women, and children, and nobody says, don't show that!
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:15.161]  You go to one of the Holocaust museums and it shows it, and we should!
[01:12:16.522 --> 01:12:18.623]  But now we shouldn't show dead babies in America!
[01:12:19.123 --> 01:12:20.944]  Well, that's what they think in Bel Air, Kansas.
[01:12:21.484 --> 01:12:25.705]  They've eliminated our truth truck from being there.
[01:12:25.745 --> 01:12:26.846]  They've found an obscure
[01:12:27.646 --> 01:12:30.129]  A city zoning ordinance, if you can believe that.
[01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:33.053]  A zoning ordinance to prosecute me.
[01:12:33.513 --> 01:12:35.916]  I am facing six months in jail and a thousand dollar fine.
[01:12:35.936 --> 01:12:42.284]  It's a misdemeanor charge for having a, what they call a portable sign on public street.
[01:12:42.344 --> 01:12:45.107]  Now I'll read you here directly from the citation.
[01:12:45.979 --> 01:12:55.942]  Because I'm in violation of a zoning regulation, and it mentions my truck, and it says that the truck was bearing writings and pictorial representations on its sides.
[01:12:56.462 --> 01:12:57.263]  Catch this.
[01:12:57.763 --> 01:13:01.604]  Calculated to attract the attention of the public.
[01:13:01.824 --> 01:13:07.066]  Now that's a total violation of the First Amendment, but the federal courts will probably say it's wonderful and that they can do it.
[01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:09.806]  Well, I've got a great law firm.
[01:13:12.123 --> 01:13:15.968]  What I'm saying is, with past rulings, they're so insane that who knows what they'll do.
[01:13:16.468 --> 01:13:21.555]  But I guarantee you, you can go out and show other moving signs and show that this is selective enforcement.
[01:13:21.835 --> 01:13:26.160]  Well, the very same day that I was arrested, I went and traveled through the streets of this small city.
[01:13:26.841 --> 01:13:31.026]  And we saw Penske trucks, McDonald's trucks, Pepsi trucks, Sears vans.
[01:13:31.645 --> 01:13:34.331]  You name it, they were all parked on the public street.
[01:13:34.451 --> 01:13:41.546]  Even people with bumper stickers, if you read the letter of the law, if you get a bumper sticker, that's calculating to attract the attention of the public.
[01:13:41.586 --> 01:13:42.929]  It's a portable sign, isn't it?
[01:13:43.967 --> 01:14:01.620]  So what they want to do is they want to regulate what you say and how you say it on your vehicle, even though it's a duly licensed, insured vehicle, on the public street, which the Supreme Court has said over and over again are quintessentially the public fora for public dissemination of information.
[01:14:03.513 --> 01:14:04.074]  Amazing.
[01:14:04.194 --> 01:14:06.356]  And look, I'm speechless here.
[01:14:06.396 --> 01:14:09.560]  I mean, it's getting worse and worse and worse with the First Amendment.
[01:14:10.241 --> 01:14:14.586]  And I wouldn't expect, I mean, I'd expect this in Bel Air, California, but not Bel Air, Kansas.
[01:14:14.706 --> 01:14:16.928]  Well, we'll tell you what, it's a little bit bigger.
[01:14:18.610 --> 01:14:19.551]  Wichita, Kansas.
[01:14:19.631 --> 01:14:24.496]  Wichita, which is just one mile south of Bel Air, is the abortion capital of the world.
[01:14:24.556 --> 01:14:30.902]  Not if your listeners know that, but that's where George Tiller resides, and he has the biggest abortion clinic in the world.
[01:14:31.122 --> 01:14:34.305]  He claims to have more third trimester abortion experience
[01:14:35.226 --> 01:14:37.348]  Well, let's call it what it is.
[01:14:37.388 --> 01:14:39.171]  He has the biggest death camp in the U.S.
[01:14:53.146 --> 01:14:57.529]  And that's why they're just incensed and that's why they found or made up this new law.
[01:14:57.589 --> 01:15:01.832]  Yeah, I bet money they called up the police chief and said, get that guy off the street.
[01:15:02.092 --> 01:15:07.656]  Well, when was the last time you heard the police chief coming down and issuing the citation for the building zoning ordinance?
[01:15:07.696 --> 01:15:09.197]  Yeah, describe what happened that day.
[01:15:09.777 --> 01:15:28.563]  Well, I placed the truck, we had some taxes going back and forth between the city managers, I mean the city attorney in our law firm claiming that this is a freedom of speech issue and the First Amendment takes supremacy over any of their local ordinances and they refused to back down and we told them we were coming back at a particular day and time and we did that.
[01:15:28.763 --> 01:15:31.324]  We were met by the police chief
[01:15:32.342 --> 01:15:34.903]  And the zoning officer, Keith Price.
[01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:38.963]  And at that time, Mr. Price began to issue this citation.
[01:15:39.003 --> 01:15:40.084]  He didn't even know how to fill it out.
[01:15:40.304 --> 01:15:42.304]  He was shaking like a leaf.
[01:15:42.324 --> 01:15:50.046]  He didn't know how to fill it out, but the police chief made sure that it was all filled out properly, and they issued me that citation.
[01:15:50.726 --> 01:15:55.007]  So people are breathing the smoke of dead babies.
[01:15:55.987 --> 01:15:59.788]  And seeing the ashes, and smelling the putrid
[01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:06.578]  I'm a full-time pro-life activist and I want to see abortion in America and I want to see it stop right here in Wichita, Kansas first.
[01:16:18.649 --> 01:16:22.772]  According to the FBI training manuals, we're all terrorists when we're against abortion now.
[01:16:23.233 --> 01:16:24.554]  Well, you know, I'll tell you a quick story.
[01:16:24.634 --> 01:16:25.755]  I was in Washington, D.C.
[01:16:25.795 --> 01:16:36.964]  in support of Judge Roy Moore back in October, and it was the first day, actually the Sunday previous to the first day the Supreme Court was coming back into session, and they were hoping and praying that they were going to hear Judge Moore's case.
[01:16:38.325 --> 01:16:39.826]  Well, I was praying out in front of St.
[01:16:39.866 --> 01:16:42.368]  Matthew's Cathedral, where all the Supreme Court justices were,
[01:16:43.195 --> 01:16:53.198]  And Federal Marshals came in with flak jackets, and you know, the boots, and the machine guns, and the bulletproof helmets, and the goggles, the glasses, and all this stuff.
[01:16:53.758 --> 01:16:57.559]  And they swept the street clean of all of us praying.
[01:16:57.599 --> 01:17:00.379]  And I spent six hours in jail thanks to the Federal Marshals.
[01:17:00.739 --> 01:17:03.640]  And we used to do this every single year in Washington, D.C.
[01:17:03.860 --> 01:17:05.321]  We always pray for the Supreme Court.
[01:17:05.361 --> 01:17:06.561]  It always opens in prayer.
[01:17:06.961 --> 01:17:10.742]  But you can't pray in front of a church if the Federal Marshals are watching.
[01:17:11.576 --> 01:17:14.157]  Well, again, folks, is that America?
[01:17:14.237 --> 01:17:16.217]  Is that what the red, white, and blue is all about?
[01:17:16.377 --> 01:17:23.239]  And under the guise of terrorism, it's the homeschoolers, the Christians, the liberal with a no-blood-for-oil sign.
[01:17:23.659 --> 01:17:26.519]  It's anybody they don't agree with.
[01:17:27.219 --> 01:17:36.581]  And shame on all the leftists who thought this was all cute when Clinton started this with Reno, breaking people's arms, not letting you protest, charging pro-lifers with racketeering.
[01:17:37.462 --> 01:17:38.642]  Shame on you!
[01:17:41.078 --> 01:17:49.047]  I'll tell you, it's enough to make your blood boil, but I do have faith in Americans and that they're seeing the usurpation of our rights.
[01:17:49.247 --> 01:17:50.609]  Well, this is a great example, sir.
[01:17:51.930 --> 01:17:55.734]  Troy Newman, who's an American hero, is that I saw the polls.
[01:17:55.835 --> 01:17:59.619]  Ten years ago, the vast majority of Americans were for abortion.
[01:17:59.659 --> 01:18:00.520]  Only about 35% were against.
[01:18:02.041 --> 01:18:03.382]  Now the numbers have reversed.
[01:18:03.422 --> 01:18:08.546]  As you said, 70 plus percent of young people, what is it, 58 percent of men, 55 percent of women.
[01:18:09.047 --> 01:18:12.489]  The numbers have flipped and they're racing every year.
[01:18:12.769 --> 01:18:14.311]  We're gaining more points on them.
[01:18:15.011 --> 01:18:19.074]  And so we're hurting their little death camp Nazi industry.
[01:18:19.294 --> 01:18:26.380]  This shows that when activists take action and don't stop and go to jail and have all this happen to you, you are saving lives.
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.901]  You have had an effect.
[01:18:28.181 --> 01:18:29.162]  God bless you!
[01:18:29.562 --> 01:18:32.544]  Well, Alex, I appreciate that, and I've got to give all the glory to God.
[01:18:32.564 --> 01:18:37.829]  You know, these truth trucks, they do an in-run around the major media outlets.
[01:18:37.849 --> 01:18:40.551]  You're not going to see what an abortion looks like on the evening news.
[01:18:40.591 --> 01:18:42.432]  Peter Jenks is not going to show it to you.
[01:18:42.993 --> 01:18:44.514]  You're not going to see it in the LA Times.
[01:18:44.534 --> 01:18:46.175]  You're not going to see it in any major newspaper.
[01:18:46.195 --> 01:18:47.696]  You're not going to see it on the Discovery Channel.
[01:18:48.037 --> 01:18:52.840]  But we're going to put these pictures on the sides of our trucks, and we've got four of them, and I'm working on a fifth one now.
[01:18:53.281 --> 01:18:54.422]  We've driven over 250,000 miles across America.
[01:18:56.643 --> 01:19:01.205]  Millions of people have seen the graphic truth of what abortion does to a little baby.
[01:19:01.605 --> 01:19:04.226]  In fact, I'd like to bring it to Austin, Texas, to be honest with you.
[01:19:04.986 --> 01:19:09.788]  I'd like to bring it down there and show the people exactly what abortion does to an innocent baby.
[01:19:10.049 --> 01:19:16.031]  That's going to change the hearts and engage the minds, which eventually will change in the voting booths.
[01:19:17.561 --> 01:19:18.202]  Absolutely.
[01:19:18.242 --> 01:19:28.940]  You know, years ago they would air my TV show on local cable over and over again as a request, but when I started playing video clips of babies being cut apart, suddenly I can't get my shows aired for anything.
[01:19:30.296 --> 01:19:43.788]  No, they'll censor that, and as evidenced, they're in Bel Air, where they pull out the stops and they formulate some new law and arrest you on some vague and ambiguous building code ordinance.
[01:19:43.969 --> 01:19:44.649]  It's ridiculous.
[01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:47.332]  Hey, I'll tell you what, Troy, you want to take some phone calls?
[01:19:47.572 --> 01:19:48.052]  Absolutely.
[01:19:48.273 --> 01:19:49.734]  Alright, phone calls for our guests at 800-259-9231.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:00.002]  Late summer 2003, mainstream press tells us we're having a stock market recovery.
[01:20:00.402 --> 01:20:03.143]  Late summer 2002, I heard the same thing.
[01:20:03.603 --> 01:20:06.464]  Late summer 2001, you heard the same thing.
[01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:13.987]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average, currently trading in a 93 to 9400 range, is down 7% from two years ago.
[01:20:14.488 --> 01:20:15.388]  That's recovery?
[01:20:15.988 --> 01:20:21.190]  Gold, now trading in the $360 range, is up 31% in that same period.
[01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:23.131]  Where do you want your hard-earned money?
[01:20:23.826 --> 01:20:26.567]  Hi folks, this is Jack Brown with Midas Resources.
[01:20:31.270 --> 01:20:32.870]  I love the sound of real money.
[01:20:33.271 --> 01:20:38.613]  Call your representative today at Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.053 --> 01:20:43.636]  Learn how to protect your assets with real wealth, not potentially worthless paper.
[01:20:44.016 --> 01:20:44.816]  Call now, 800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.876 --> 01:20:45.056]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.805 --> 01:20:59.048]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:20:59.188 --> 01:21:05.351]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:21:05.631 --> 01:21:14.075]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:21:14.316 --> 01:21:21.319]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:26.462]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:32.086]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:21:32.426 --> 01:21:35.508]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:43.754]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:43.854 --> 01:21:44.414]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:53.041 --> 01:21:53.962]  I think so.
[01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:09.839]  We're good to go!
[01:22:38.715 --> 01:22:41.798]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:47.823]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:22:51.442 --> 01:22:52.783]  Hey Doris, great news!
[01:22:53.043 --> 01:22:57.285]  I now own my own home, free and clear, and I did it in less than five months.
[01:22:57.385 --> 01:22:58.705]  Did you receive an inheritance?
[01:22:58.926 --> 01:23:04.268]  Well no, actually I found a way to eliminate my mortgage without bankruptcy and without the need of going to court.
[01:23:04.388 --> 01:23:07.650]  And you too can do this legally, lawfully, ethically, and morally.
[01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:10.171]  But Jim, I signed a note promising to pay back the loan.
[01:23:10.291 --> 01:23:12.292]  Isn't it wrong even if I could discharge the loan?
[01:23:12.532 --> 01:23:17.397]  Doris, I felt the same way until I took the time to learn the truth about money and banking.
[01:23:17.518 --> 01:23:21.402]  The most shocking thing I learned is the fact that no real money is ever loaned out.
[01:23:21.542 --> 01:23:24.225]  There's a dirty secret that the banks don't want you to know.
[01:23:24.405 --> 01:23:27.989]  And this is the basis of how I was able to discharge my own mortgage.
[01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:31.092]  I know this is hard to believe, but go to the website to learn more.
[01:23:31.233 --> 01:23:31.533]  Doris,
[01:23:31.733 --> 01:23:38.598]  Get your PIN and find out how many Americans are finding financial freedom by having their mortgages eliminated in less than five months.
[01:23:38.818 --> 01:23:43.442]  Go to www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:23:43.562 --> 01:23:45.983]  Just the way it sounds and there's an S after mortgage.
[01:23:46.183 --> 01:23:50.867]  It's www.eliminatemortgages.com slash liberty.
[01:23:56.075 --> 01:23:58.596]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:23:59.076 --> 01:24:01.857]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:02.278 --> 01:24:11.061]  Alright folks, we're talking to Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue.org.
[01:24:11.081 --> 01:24:17.744]  We're about to go to some calls for our guests, but I want to stress this again.
[01:24:17.764 --> 01:24:21.366]  80 plus percent of Americans are against open borders.
[01:24:21.706 --> 01:24:23.887]  Whether it's Republicans or Democrats, they just leave them open.
[01:24:25.828 --> 01:24:30.910]  The vast majority of Americans are now against abortion, whereas the vast majority were for it just a decade ago.
[01:24:31.770 --> 01:24:35.992]  My point is, a couple decades ago, most people were for more open borders.
[01:24:36.072 --> 01:24:37.312]  But people aren't stupid.
[01:24:37.592 --> 01:24:38.413]  They've been woken up.
[01:24:38.473 --> 01:24:39.413]  They've seen the effects.
[01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:40.833]  We do have power.
[01:24:40.933 --> 01:24:42.174]  We can affect change.
[01:24:42.454 --> 01:24:45.255]  But you out there have to become leaders in these fights.
[01:24:45.922 --> 01:24:51.684]  Whether it's the Second Amendment or abortion, or the anti-family agenda in the media.
[01:24:51.744 --> 01:24:53.205]  I've got an article here from Nickelodeon.
[01:24:53.225 --> 01:25:00.247]  A TV show depicts teen gay romance in a TV show designed for children 8 to 11.
[01:25:01.107 --> 01:25:05.789]  I mean, there shouldn't be any sex, period, in these shows, much less of that type.
[01:25:05.869 --> 01:25:07.290]  It's just out of control.
[01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:10.231]  We've got to say no and boycott and protest this.
[01:25:11.251 --> 01:25:13.332]  Let's go back to our guest.
[01:25:14.068 --> 01:25:16.010]  And I appreciate Troy coming on the show.
[01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:20.194]  Troy, before we go to Mike in Virginia and others that want to talk to you, anything else you want to add?
[01:25:20.855 --> 01:25:22.397]  Well, I couldn't agree with you more on that.
[01:25:22.597 --> 01:25:27.281]  We've got to be leaders and you'd be surprised how much you can get done with just a voice.
[01:25:27.882 --> 01:25:28.523]  Your voice.
[01:25:29.313 --> 01:25:31.493]  It speaks loudly and clearly.
[01:25:31.573 --> 01:25:33.554]  Most people just sit at home and don't say anything.
[01:25:33.594 --> 01:25:34.434]  They're just frustrated.
[01:25:34.794 --> 01:25:41.535]  But when you speak out, you know, look, we're a republic, and we're governed for the people, by the people.
[01:25:41.855 --> 01:25:47.116]  So let your representatives know, let your voice be heard everywhere across the land, and don't be silent.
[01:25:47.656 --> 01:25:55.158]  I don't have the polls in front of me, sir, but I was shooting out the numbers, you said those were accurate, but I remember reading 70 plus percent, you said 76 percent.
[01:25:56.158 --> 01:26:01.000]  Seventy-two on the kids, fifty-five on, that's the young people, the recent Gallup poll.
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:13.624]  Yeah, I read that about a month ago on air, but it's totally, it was about a bunch of polls, it's totally shifted now, so it's gone from thirty-something percent being against abortion to seventy-something percent, that's millions of babies that are going to be saved!
[01:26:13.805 --> 01:26:23.048]  Oh, you know, and it's actually more shocking, they thought, the polls years ago were, is abortion morally wrong, and only thirty-one percent said yes.
[01:26:23.508 --> 01:26:25.810]  Today, they're asking the question a little differently.
[01:26:26.110 --> 01:26:31.615]  They're asking, do you believe that abortion is murder, in other words, homicide, the killing of an innocent human being?
[01:26:32.075 --> 01:26:36.219]  And they're answering in the affirmative by wide majorities.
[01:26:37.563 --> 01:26:41.925]  So that really shows that they're even trying to spend the polls and it's not working for them.
[01:26:41.986 --> 01:26:42.606]  Exactly.
[01:26:43.026 --> 01:26:48.129]  So they can try to keep it legal and do whatever they want, it's going to get to the point where they're just not going to have any business.
[01:26:48.309 --> 01:26:51.191]  Well, time's on our side and we have to make it illegal, though.
[01:26:51.231 --> 01:26:56.654]  The civil government must make things like this absolutely illegal.
[01:26:56.774 --> 01:26:59.475]  That's what they're there for, to protect innocent human life.
[01:27:00.076 --> 01:27:02.097]  It's unfortunate, but when things are legal,
[01:27:03.458 --> 01:27:04.158]  People will use it.
[01:27:04.178 --> 01:27:12.125]  If you decriminalize drugs, if you decriminalize stealing or murder, people will do these things because it's okay.
[01:27:12.765 --> 01:27:14.727]  But just because it's legal doesn't make it right.
[01:27:14.747 --> 01:27:17.329]  Well, I agree with you, except for the drug thing.
[01:27:17.569 --> 01:27:21.252]  Not for legalization, but you've got the private prisons.
[01:27:21.292 --> 01:27:24.615]  The government has been caught shipping them in, and they create the crisis 9 out of 10.
[01:27:25.035 --> 01:27:27.738]  Yeah, that's a whole other discussion for another day.
[01:27:28.298 --> 01:27:29.119]  Mike in Virginia.
[01:27:29.179 --> 01:27:29.920]  Mike, you're on the air.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:30.300]  Go ahead.
[01:27:32.236 --> 01:27:33.536]  I'm going to talk to you, Mike, go ahead.
[01:27:35.977 --> 01:27:46.540]  On the abortion issue, and that would be that, and I believe both of you would probably agree, unfortunately our majority population are pretty ignorant, as I used to be also.
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:52.842]  I used to be considered abortion a choice, and that was, you know, that just showed my total ignorance of this subject matter.
[01:27:52.862 --> 01:27:57.903]  But the additional perspective is that abortion is actually a satanic blood
[01:27:58.516 --> 01:28:17.812]  sacrifice ritual and they actually draw their power on it and that's why they feel that you're threatening their power base and they're going to the extremes to protect it now that they've got it basically on a mass scale and I would venture to say that your guests would agree on this but I'd like his input on it also and I appreciate your show Alex.
[01:28:18.012 --> 01:28:18.833]  Alright, thank you.
[01:28:19.073 --> 01:28:27.059]  You go back to Herod, you go back to the Egyptian kings, you go back to Hitler, they did believe the mass killing was empowering them.
[01:28:27.159 --> 01:28:27.820]  A comment sir?
[01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:30.701]  Well, it even goes back further than that.
[01:28:30.761 --> 01:28:34.803]  The Mole Bites were the first people recorded in the scripture sacrificing their own children.
[01:28:35.203 --> 01:28:39.125]  All the Baal and Asherah worship were sexual immorality and child killing.
[01:28:39.425 --> 01:28:42.646]  In 1 Corinthians, it says those things that the pagans sacrificed.
[01:28:42.666 --> 01:28:43.967]  They sacrificed to demons.
[01:28:44.447 --> 01:28:55.372]  Here at George Tiller's Abortion Clinic, we regularly see notorious witches going in and out of there, particularly at times when that big incinerator lights up.
[01:28:56.036 --> 01:29:05.821]  So whether we're doing it actively or in ignorance, it is something that is a demonic presence and we have to combat that spiritually.
[01:29:06.841 --> 01:29:07.862]  That is so sick.
[01:29:07.962 --> 01:29:15.105]  Yeah, I've read in mainstream news that occultists gather around abortion clinics and a lot of times work in them.
[01:29:15.306 --> 01:29:18.527]  I mean, who else could rip babies apart ten hours a day?
[01:29:19.348 --> 01:29:19.888]  Makes you think.
[01:29:19.988 --> 01:29:21.909]  I tell you what, sir, can you stay with us a little bit longer?
[01:29:22.589 --> 01:29:28.594]  Because I've got Allison in California, and Henry in Oregon disagrees with you.
[01:29:28.674 --> 01:29:29.695]  I can't wait to hear this.
[01:29:29.715 --> 01:29:30.435]  Yeah, me too.
[01:29:31.476 --> 01:29:32.076]  My goodness.
[01:29:33.918 --> 01:29:35.039]  You disagree, you agree.
[01:29:35.059 --> 01:29:35.699]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:29:35.879 --> 01:29:39.942]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:39.962 --> 01:29:40.383]  Stay with us.
[01:29:43.365 --> 01:29:44.266]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.746 --> 01:29:46.367]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.288 --> 01:29:49.970]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:53.522 --> 01:30:57.423]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:30:57.643 --> 01:31:09.926]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:31:10.346 --> 01:31:10.746]  The U.S.
[01:31:10.806 --> 01:31:16.368]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:31:16.768 --> 01:31:18.989]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:31:20.849 --> 01:31:21.909]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:31:21.949 --> 01:31:24.790]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:30.932]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[01:32:54.566 --> 01:32:59.728]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:00.388 --> 01:33:02.749]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:33:03.909 --> 01:33:05.069]  We're in a war, folks.
[01:33:06.010 --> 01:33:10.771]  And again, I cannot stress how exciting it is that we've seen the poll numbers reverse themselves
[01:33:11.631 --> 01:33:23.082]  And that despite all the propaganda, women are starting to wake up that abortion isn't some wonderful right they've got, that the evil men aren't trying to take this wondrous right away from them.
[01:33:23.503 --> 01:33:29.509]  Because so many women have had abortions and have horrible experiences and are now speaking out against it.
[01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:32.410]  That's one of the biggest groups out there standing against this.
[01:33:32.450 --> 01:33:36.151]  We're going to go to Henry and then Allison and Bill and others.
[01:33:36.791 --> 01:33:40.112]  Henry, in Oregon you say you disagree with our guest on some issue.
[01:33:40.153 --> 01:33:40.553]  Go ahead.
[01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:41.753]  I indeed do.
[01:33:41.773 --> 01:33:44.354]  I just want to know where these people get off.
[01:33:45.206 --> 01:33:53.872]  I think they can tell an individual free sovereign citizen of the Republic what they can put in or take out of their individual body.
[01:33:54.253 --> 01:33:58.376]  Let me just say something, Henry, right now on this.
[01:33:59.296 --> 01:34:00.357]  It's a human being.
[01:34:00.517 --> 01:34:01.238]  It's separate.
[01:34:01.718 --> 01:34:02.699]  That's an opinion, Alex.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:21.381]  That's your opinion based on your Bible, buddy.
[01:34:21.401 --> 01:34:21.982]  No, it's not my opinion.
[01:34:22.042 --> 01:34:23.643]  I'm not buying your moral relativism.
[01:34:23.663 --> 01:34:27.846]  Well, I'm telling you that I'm tired of you people trying to stick your Bible in my face, man.
[01:34:28.166 --> 01:34:35.792]  I'm telling you that, you know, you stick to your own beliefs and leave the other individual sovereigns in this country alone because you're making more enemies than you are friends anymore, buddy.
[01:34:36.713 --> 01:34:38.853]  Oh, you're getting really mad, deep down.
[01:34:38.894 --> 01:34:39.934]  I'm past mad.
[01:34:40.194 --> 01:34:43.695]  And I'm telling you, tell your buddy to bring his truck to Tillopland, Oregon.
[01:34:43.775 --> 01:34:44.635]  Okay, put him on hold.
[01:34:44.995 --> 01:34:45.615]  Put him on hold.
[01:34:46.395 --> 01:34:52.876]  I can tell he's about to start getting hateful and spewing things we can't have on the radio.
[01:34:53.317 --> 01:34:55.757]  Man, I tell you, you make me sick.
[01:34:55.797 --> 01:34:57.357]  I can just hear the hate in your voice.
[01:34:58.998 --> 01:35:01.918]  Go ahead and comment on that, Troy.
[01:35:02.478 --> 01:35:05.099]  Well, you know, that was really a...
[01:35:07.793 --> 01:35:08.073]  Absolutely.
[01:35:08.173 --> 01:35:09.835]  And so did Scott Peterson.
[01:35:34.595 --> 01:35:37.296]  So we've got to look at this from a medical aspect.
[01:35:37.616 --> 01:35:40.436]  We can look at it from a philosophical... Well, what's wrong with this guy?
[01:35:40.476 --> 01:35:42.497]  We've got to protect the little innocent.
[01:35:42.537 --> 01:35:44.937]  He doesn't get any more weak and defenseless.
[01:35:45.177 --> 01:35:46.577]  These are babies, buddy!
[01:35:47.538 --> 01:35:48.758]  And you know, this is sick!
[01:35:48.798 --> 01:35:56.379]  And what happens is, people are involved in abortions, and they're not man enough to get their minds out from around this.
[01:35:56.739 --> 01:35:59.740]  And look, I didn't start by attacking this guy.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:04.003]  I mean, I might have gotten mad at him, but I heard a lot of hatred in his voice.
[01:36:04.304 --> 01:36:14.273]  Sure, a lot of people that are in favor of abortion are very angry, maybe because they participated in it at one time, and their guilty conscience speaks out.
[01:36:14.433 --> 01:36:15.635]  So, we've got to let them know.
[01:36:16.495 --> 01:36:27.925]  Look, forgiveness can be had, but seizing in anger and casting ad hominem attacks at those people that are speaking the truth and logic and reason is not really the way to go about it.
[01:36:27.945 --> 01:36:35.192]  Well, he was about to say, and I'll try to bring him back up if he'll be nice and we won't call him names, he won't call us names, we won't get off into
[01:36:35.772 --> 01:36:39.173]  But I thought he was going to say, you know, bring your truck here and see what happens.
[01:36:39.473 --> 01:36:41.114]  I thought he agrees in this freedom.
[01:36:42.214 --> 01:36:43.915]  What about the First Amendment?
[01:36:44.875 --> 01:36:46.736]  Now, I want to be friends with you, Henry.
[01:36:46.936 --> 01:36:47.996]  Let's bring Henry back up.
[01:36:48.616 --> 01:36:48.897]  Henry?
[01:36:49.277 --> 01:36:49.517]  Yeah.
[01:36:49.997 --> 01:36:50.357]  Okay.
[01:36:50.997 --> 01:36:53.858]  Now, what were you going to say if he brought his truck to Oregon?
[01:36:54.138 --> 01:37:04.442]  Well, there's an unknown law called the Fighting Words Doctrine, which says if you put something in my face that angers me to the point where I lose control, I got right.
[01:37:07.630 --> 01:37:13.373]  I've never had nothing to do with an abortion and you want to know my opinion on abortion?
[01:37:13.393 --> 01:37:14.834]  Why don't you like the little babies then?
[01:37:17.335 --> 01:37:20.577]  Would you like to know my opinion on abortion?
[01:37:20.797 --> 01:37:21.037]  Yes.
[01:37:21.237 --> 01:37:22.138]  I haven't got one.
[01:37:22.258 --> 01:37:23.238]  I don't have a uterus.
[01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:28.121]  I don't know what that other person feels or what they think when they do the things.
[01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:33.544]  I mean as far as the third trimester stuff and the stuff I've seen on TV, it sickens me.
[01:37:34.528 --> 01:37:41.712]  A lot of things that happen stick in me, but it's not up to me to tell another person what their rights are or what they can do.
[01:37:41.992 --> 01:37:44.894]  Henry, that's a great, great question.
[01:37:45.174 --> 01:37:51.898]  And let me answer it by saying this, that I'm not an African American, but I don't have to be one to be against slavery.
[01:37:52.378 --> 01:37:55.260]  And I don't have any Jewish ancestry, but I don't have to be one
[01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:57.762]  Uh, to be against the Nazi Holocaust.
[01:37:58.222 --> 01:38:07.088]  But I was once a very tiny, innocent baby, and I'm very glad that my mom decided to give birth to me rather than to take me to an abortion clinic.
[01:38:07.168 --> 01:38:08.249]  You were once one too.
[01:38:08.269 --> 01:38:08.950]  Yes.
[01:38:09.070 --> 01:38:14.674]  And as a big person, you need to protect the little people, and particularly as a male,
[01:38:15.314 --> 01:38:16.977]  A defender of humankind.
[01:38:17.398 --> 01:38:19.701]  You need to really stand up for those who can't speak for themselves.
[01:38:19.721 --> 01:38:21.244]  General, let me just say this to you, okay?
[01:38:21.444 --> 01:38:22.245]  And I want to be your friend.
[01:38:22.265 --> 01:38:22.946]  Let me just tell you this.
[01:38:23.126 --> 01:38:26.331]  My instincts rage against this, as a man.
[01:38:27.228 --> 01:38:42.557]  Okay, when I see, again, people picking on somebody, when I see people being mean to an old lady, when I see innocents, widows, and orphans, and the globalists abusing the weak worldwide, it makes my blood boil.
[01:38:42.697 --> 01:38:45.659]  And you've got to do some soul-searching.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.381]  You say it makes you angry, but at the same time you say it's their right.
[01:38:49.742 --> 01:38:52.243]  This is a separate human being.
[01:38:52.263 --> 01:38:53.884]  You were there.
[01:38:55.505 --> 01:38:58.768]  And so I think you really need to do some soul-searching, Henry.
[01:38:58.788 --> 01:39:03.372]  I really don't recall being nowhere like that, Alex, and I cannot say that.
[01:39:03.432 --> 01:39:05.054]  I mean, you have the Bible.
[01:39:05.354 --> 01:39:07.296]  Go buy it.
[01:39:07.596 --> 01:39:09.077]  And I'll die for your rights.
[01:39:09.558 --> 01:39:10.379]  Go buy your Bible.
[01:39:11.059 --> 01:39:11.760]  But the thing is,
[01:39:13.099 --> 01:39:17.101]  I mean, when you start bringing that over into another realm, I mean, I see it a lot on GCN anymore.
[01:39:17.121 --> 01:39:18.721]  I mean, you're causing divisiveness.
[01:39:18.741 --> 01:39:22.963]  There's a lot of people out there that just turned against you because... Oh yeah, sure they did.
[01:39:23.023 --> 01:39:23.763]  I hope they did.
[01:39:23.943 --> 01:39:26.704]  Hey, hey, I don't want to be with the people that are going straight to hell.
[01:39:26.744 --> 01:39:27.324]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:27.664 --> 01:39:28.705]  No, no, thanks for your call.
[01:39:28.765 --> 01:39:29.385]  I appreciate it.
[01:39:30.125 --> 01:39:30.665]  Listen to me.
[01:39:31.346 --> 01:39:31.846]  Listen to me.
[01:39:32.886 --> 01:39:33.206]  Okay?
[01:39:33.546 --> 01:39:35.087]  I want people to understand something here.
[01:39:36.129 --> 01:39:36.490]  Okay?
[01:39:37.151 --> 01:39:39.754]  I don't do this show to be popular.
[01:39:39.774 --> 01:39:40.515]  Do you understand that?
[01:39:40.656 --> 01:39:42.739]  I don't care what people think about me.
[01:39:42.799 --> 01:39:43.960]  And understand something.
[01:39:44.441 --> 01:39:46.724]  We are the majority now that are against abortion.
[01:39:46.945 --> 01:39:48.927]  We are the majority that are against open borders.
[01:39:49.128 --> 01:39:51.131]  We are the majority that are for the Second Amendment.
[01:39:51.571 --> 01:39:51.912]  Okay?
[01:39:52.472 --> 01:40:01.804]  And bottom line, we weren't the majority just a few years ago, but we've been educating people and unlocking minds, and we're going to win this fight.
[01:40:01.884 --> 01:40:06.349]  And I'm proud to have people that don't like me because I'm anti-abortion.
[01:40:06.549 --> 01:40:06.810]  Troy?
[01:40:07.510 --> 01:40:24.749]  I would agree absolutely 100%, and I would say to this young man who doesn't like the Bible, the fact is that he lives in a Bible-centered community, because without the Ten Commandments, which is delivered to us by our Founding Fathers, and the inner workings that we have in our
[01:40:25.316 --> 01:40:27.157]  Our own civil law structure.
[01:40:27.478 --> 01:40:30.980]  We would not have the United States without Christian thought and culture.
[01:40:31.481 --> 01:40:37.465]  And so he can say that he doesn't like the Bible, but he certainly enjoys the freedom that the Bible gives us.
[01:40:37.485 --> 01:40:39.066]  He certainly enjoyed the fruits.
[01:40:39.607 --> 01:40:40.087]  Absolutely.
[01:40:40.107 --> 01:40:44.630]  And now that we're leaving that plan, we're now losing the fruits.
[01:40:45.411 --> 01:40:50.855]  And if we don't turn back, if we don't return to an absolute objective standard
[01:40:51.753 --> 01:40:52.614]  Of right and wrong.
[01:40:52.754 --> 01:41:00.240]  See, the people that want to run roughshod over objective standards, this post-modernism, relativism, that there's no moral absolute.
[01:41:00.340 --> 01:41:01.421]  That's hogwash.
[01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:02.762]  And here's my argument to that.
[01:41:03.222 --> 01:41:08.206]  The Aztecs would kill 10,000 people every year at Chichen Itza alone.
[01:41:08.846 --> 01:41:09.086]  Yes.
[01:41:09.287 --> 01:41:14.871]  And they believed that they had to do that to make the gods keep dreaming, because if the gods woke up, reality would end.
[01:41:16.187 --> 01:41:23.873]  And I've been on the air before criticizing the Aztecs, criticizing the Nazis as well, and people will call in to go, that's their culture, how dare you, it's just their culture, you can't judge.
[01:41:24.113 --> 01:41:27.235]  Then I go, well wait, the Nazis had a culture of killing millions of people.
[01:41:27.255 --> 01:41:29.577]  They go, well that's different, don't you say, I'm a Nazi!
[01:41:29.797 --> 01:41:32.019]  You know, this is this moral relativism.
[01:41:32.379 --> 01:41:40.505]  Killing innocents because you don't like them is evil and is wrong, and you know, even the Muslims know you're not supposed to have abortion.
[01:41:41.741 --> 01:41:42.902]  Well, it's absolutely right.
[01:41:43.142 --> 01:41:49.268]  We know inherently that murder is wrong, and we get it from the Sixth Commandment, and that's where we get all of our homicide laws.
[01:41:50.249 --> 01:41:52.471]  So we must adhere at least
[01:41:54.056 --> 01:42:07.308]  Proportionally, we've got to give credence to the fact that all the laws in our country, at least early on, were directly stemming from the moral, objective foundation found in the scriptures.
[01:42:07.528 --> 01:42:08.469]  Well, here's the roots.
[01:42:08.969 --> 01:42:11.251]  Mount Sinai, Moses, 3,000 years ago, 1214 Magna Carta, 1789 Bill of Rights.
[01:42:11.271 --> 01:42:11.491]  Lex Rex, too.
[01:42:20.489 --> 01:42:25.532]  You know, we have to understand that the law is a standard by which we must rule ourselves.
[01:42:25.872 --> 01:42:32.695]  If we fall into moral relativism, then what's wrong today could be right tomorrow, and then topsy-turvy next week.
[01:42:33.916 --> 01:42:39.559]  If we can't stand on the fact that human life is sacred, that we must not take it, then what can we stand on?
[01:42:40.219 --> 01:42:44.821]  Well, then I guess we'll have marriages between men and men, and men and bobcats, and children.
[01:42:44.961 --> 01:42:46.202]  Well, this is how it all began.
[01:42:46.222 --> 01:42:48.963]  Hitler's first orders in 1934
[01:42:50.859 --> 01:42:53.105]  Or to kill retarded children.
[01:42:53.305 --> 01:42:54.708]  And to finance abortions.
[01:42:55.587 --> 01:43:01.309]  And then it grew into what we saw happen, and that same eugenics mindset is rampant today.
[01:43:01.349 --> 01:43:08.772]  I mean, I'm sure you've seen the Henry Kissinger documents from 1973 about, we must sterilize half the women forcibly if they want IMF and World Bank funding.
[01:43:08.792 --> 01:43:09.833]  I mean, this is evil, folks!
[01:43:09.853 --> 01:43:18.876]  And it's being played out today here in Wichita, Kansas, because George Tiller specializes in second and third trimester abortions on the infirm, the weak, and the handicapped.
[01:43:19.197 --> 01:43:22.418]  He specializes on children that have so-called defects.
[01:43:23.238 --> 01:43:25.500]  And he's making millions off of it.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:32.586]  Tell me the Malthus and Planned Parenthood Sanger eugenics program isn't in place today.
[01:43:33.767 --> 01:43:45.636]  Well, Margaret Sanger got awards from Hitler, gave awards to Hitler, and there are a lot of people who know about the New World Order and the global corruption, but they can't seem to make the connection to this.
[01:43:45.656 --> 01:43:49.480]  And they go, oh, well, it's just a right approach.
[01:43:50.541 --> 01:43:59.511]  Look, in China, that gets the UN funding that Bush just increased, by the way, through UNESCO, they kill the babies after birth.
[01:43:59.732 --> 01:44:04.477]  And now Dr. Peter Singer at Princeton says that's a good thing.
[01:44:04.537 --> 01:44:04.818]  Yeah.
[01:44:05.158 --> 01:44:07.481]  And that we should be able to kill babies up to two years old.
[01:44:07.661 --> 01:44:08.262]  Comments on that?
[01:44:08.999 --> 01:44:11.562]  Well, we're marching down toward a culture of death.
[01:44:11.682 --> 01:44:20.331]  When you take the weak and infirm, the ones in our community that we really need to be nurturing, and you start to kill them, then that's the natural result.
[01:44:20.671 --> 01:44:27.118]  We see toward the end of life, through killing of the older and weaker individuals,
[01:44:28.018 --> 01:44:32.920]  People that want to make suicide legal, you know, just to pop a pill or hook up a Vorkian's machine.
[01:44:33.800 --> 01:44:34.340]  What's next?
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:35.701]  I mean, there's going to be forced killing.
[01:44:35.921 --> 01:44:36.681]  We see that a lot here.
[01:44:36.701 --> 01:44:37.782]  Well, that's already happening.
[01:44:37.802 --> 01:44:46.305]  The Wall Street Journal, Wesley Smith's written about, and he's a liberal by the way, he's written about how he lists hundreds of names of people begging for food.
[01:44:46.325 --> 01:44:49.025]  Well, Terry Schiavo was a classic example.
[01:44:49.046 --> 01:44:50.106]  We just saw that in Florida.
[01:44:50.866 --> 01:45:05.644]  But, Terry, there have been cases where people are begging for food, saying, please feed me, please give me water, and they go, well, you signed a form giving us custody, and you're paralyzed neck down, so you said you didn't want any tubes or help, we're going to kill you, and they kill them!
[01:45:06.785 --> 01:45:10.868]  It's very dangerous path we're on here, folks.
[01:45:12.089 --> 01:45:13.070]  I have a rule on this show.
[01:45:13.090 --> 01:45:15.131]  If you disagree with us, you go to the line.
[01:45:15.432 --> 01:45:22.177]  We are going to get to Allison and Bill in a second, but Charles in Rhode Island disagrees.
[01:45:22.237 --> 01:45:22.917]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:45:23.117 --> 01:45:26.260]  Yeah, Alex, I want to first of all tell you that I'm very conservative.
[01:45:28.261 --> 01:45:30.763]  I was a congressional candidate here in the state of Rhode Island.
[01:45:31.364 --> 01:45:35.767]  Basically, this abortion issue, I've looked at it right down the line, and unfortunately,
[01:45:36.445 --> 01:45:39.748]  There's a worse crime than abortion, and that's being born and being unloved.
[01:45:39.828 --> 01:45:46.974]  I grew up with all those kids over here in the Rhode Island area that had no reason, you know, their parents didn't care about them or anything.
[01:45:47.014 --> 01:45:48.575]  Well, that's societal breakdown.
[01:45:48.615 --> 01:45:53.920]  You don't go further down the pit because, quote, quote, oh, well, we think you might be unloved.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.482]  You've got a poor family, so now we're gonna abort your baby.
[01:45:56.662 --> 01:45:57.703]  That's what China does.
[01:45:58.407 --> 01:45:59.928]  Yeah, but Alex, here's the problem.
[01:46:00.169 --> 01:46:02.010]  And I grew up in the 50s, okay?
[01:46:02.471 --> 01:46:05.373]  And the 60s, things were a great deal more wholesome than they are now.
[01:46:05.513 --> 01:46:06.514]  Oh, before we had abortion?
[01:46:07.856 --> 01:46:08.536]  Right, uh-huh.
[01:46:09.017 --> 01:46:15.402]  And basically, the children were neglected by their parents because of selfish reasons by their parents, okay?
[01:46:15.422 --> 01:46:17.224]  They had no business being the parents to begin with.
[01:46:17.284 --> 01:46:18.085]  So let's kill them.
[01:46:20.125 --> 01:46:28.835]  Sir Charles, how many famous scientists and minds came from orphanages and horrible homes?
[01:46:28.855 --> 01:46:29.877]  I mean, that's, come on!
[01:46:30.017 --> 01:46:30.277]  Right!
[01:46:30.638 --> 01:46:31.739]  That was their luck!
[01:46:31.839 --> 01:46:34.823]  But there's also the people that walk around that have no love.
[01:46:35.942 --> 01:46:37.504]  That's another problem in society.
[01:46:37.524 --> 01:46:38.945]  It would be better if they were just killed.
[01:46:39.005 --> 01:46:41.947]  If we're going to do freedom, Alex... Charles, I've got to be honest with you.
[01:46:41.967 --> 01:46:43.228]  You, sir, are very twisted.
[01:46:49.815 --> 01:47:03.630]  I mean, I mean, your argument for abortion, I mean, I can, you know, the argument that, well, it's the woman's body, her right, you know, that, that they can argue at a certain level to say that, well, a lot of people aren't loved, and so, you know, let's have abortion.
[01:47:03.670 --> 01:47:05.052]  I mean, what does that mean?
[01:47:05.072 --> 01:47:08.856]  It means that when you go and stand in front of God, okay?
[01:47:09.908 --> 01:47:14.511]  And you've aborted your child, or a doctor's aborted a child, or whatever the situation is.
[01:47:14.531 --> 01:47:21.515]  Do you think that any law that we're ever going to pass is ever going to harm the people as much as your God is going to harm the situation?
[01:47:21.755 --> 01:47:23.316]  So now you're saying you're against abortion?
[01:47:23.556 --> 01:47:24.297]  No, I'm saying that
[01:47:25.140 --> 01:47:33.363]  I'm saying that I am for abortion for the fact that if it gets rid of people that are going to be unloved, and they don't have that existence in society, I'm pro that.
[01:47:34.183 --> 01:47:35.303]  Okay, Charles, I can't.
[01:47:35.723 --> 01:47:36.724]  I gotta go here.
[01:47:36.764 --> 01:47:37.624]  I got some other calls.
[01:47:38.104 --> 01:47:38.924]  I'm about to vomit.
[01:47:39.504 --> 01:47:40.585]  That is scary.
[01:47:41.645 --> 01:47:47.687]  And what's scary is you sound like a nice guy, or just being like, hey, let's have social engineering comments to that, Troy.
[01:47:49.267 --> 01:47:54.069]  The Bible says, don't answer a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him in his eyes.
[01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:57.642]  I'm speechless, Charles.
[01:47:57.682 --> 01:47:59.223]  Call back sometime and we'll talk more about it.
[01:47:59.463 --> 01:48:01.383]  Let's talk to Allison in California.
[01:48:01.403 --> 01:48:01.803]  Go ahead.
[01:48:03.143 --> 01:48:04.024]  Hi, Alex.
[01:48:04.124 --> 01:48:04.864]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:48:04.904 --> 01:48:06.504]  And Troy, it's great to talk to you, too.
[01:48:07.204 --> 01:48:10.845]  And I got a little derailed here because I just want to address those last two callers.
[01:48:11.225 --> 01:48:18.106]  First of all, that last caller, Charles, is simply presuming that if a baby is born, it's going to grow up in poverty or be unloved.
[01:48:18.186 --> 01:48:19.506]  None of us can see the future.
[01:48:19.946 --> 01:48:23.907]  And so to make that judgment is a sinful thing because we don't know how the future will go.
[01:48:24.471 --> 01:48:30.337]  And I also want to address the previous caller, Henry, as a woman who did have an abortion 25 years ago.
[01:48:30.597 --> 01:48:33.500]  I can attest to the emotional damage that that does.
[01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:37.024]  And Troy Newman is, as you said, truly an American hero.
[01:48:37.324 --> 01:48:39.206]  I know him personally and I can vouch for that.
[01:48:39.574 --> 01:48:48.499]  And I wish that there had been people like him in front of the abortion clinic that I walked into 25 years ago to show me the truth about it, or I might not be spending the rest of my life being ready.
[01:48:48.519 --> 01:48:51.841]  Well, the reason our society is falling apart is what the caller said in the first hour.
[01:48:51.881 --> 01:49:03.128]  We don't know our neighbors, we're not involved, we're not loving, we're all selfish little pigs watching our TV, guzzling our beer, going to the football game, instead of being involved and helping that single mother.
[01:49:03.368 --> 01:49:05.089]  Instead of being involved in that community.
[01:49:05.150 --> 01:49:05.770]  Comments, Troy?
[01:49:06.010 --> 01:49:07.311]  Well, I couldn't agree more.
[01:49:07.351 --> 01:49:08.192]  We've got to get out there.
[01:49:08.932 --> 01:49:11.574]  To change hearts and minds, it's one at a time.
[01:49:11.614 --> 01:49:15.316]  We spend countless hours in front of abortion clinics, and thank you, Alison, for those kind words.
[01:49:15.837 --> 01:49:26.224]  I wish I was there 25 years ago, but I can say that every abortion clinic in the country is covered by sidewalk counselors that love the women going in, and they're offering them help regularly.
[01:49:27.124 --> 01:49:30.987]  Just last week, we had 12 babies saved last week from abortion.
[01:49:31.007 --> 01:49:32.408]  One of them was a set of twins.
[01:49:33.292 --> 01:49:37.155]  Just because we stood out there and offered help and said, hey, there's a better way.
[01:49:37.675 --> 01:49:48.782]  We've got a great network of people that if they need health care, if they need diapers, maternity clothes, baby cribs, whatever it is, there are people with altruistic motives.
[01:49:48.922 --> 01:49:56.447]  And then there are people who do these mental gymnastics to make excuses to accept evil so they don't have to face it.
[01:49:56.787 --> 01:49:57.387]  Right.
[01:49:57.427 --> 01:49:59.709]  Can I just comment with that?
[01:49:59.769 --> 01:50:01.550]  The one caller, the previous caller,
[01:50:02.569 --> 01:50:05.375]  We've got a real problem here Alex, as you talk about all the time.
[01:50:05.716 --> 01:50:11.950]  People think that because they don't like the message that they're free to shoot the messenger and that of course is exactly what's happened to Troy.
[01:50:12.355 --> 01:50:13.856]  With this situation in Bel Air.
[01:50:13.936 --> 01:50:21.660]  But I'll just give my question... Well, we had a caller earlier who was saying, you come to my town, I might, you know, go after you, but I'm for freedom.
[01:50:21.940 --> 01:50:23.561]  Just don't put your signs up.
[01:50:24.242 --> 01:50:25.322]  Where'd the First Amendment go?
[01:50:25.342 --> 01:50:26.503]  Well, we see that all over the place.
[01:50:26.523 --> 01:50:29.785]  We've got a situation here in San Diego with Planned Parenthood where it's the very same thing.
[01:50:29.805 --> 01:50:31.946]  They don't want us within 25 feet of the driveway.
[01:50:31.986 --> 01:50:36.188]  They've got injunctions against pro-lifers here because they don't want those graphic signs out there.
[01:50:36.408 --> 01:50:39.450]  But let me just pose my question to Troy and then I'll hang up to wait for his answer.
[01:50:40.089 --> 01:50:49.204]  Troy, I just wondered if you could describe for Alex's listeners some of the other things that go on at Tiller's Abortion Clinic, like the fact that his church supports him and also those ceremonies that he does.
[01:50:49.705 --> 01:50:51.568]  Okay, we'll come back and talk about it.
[01:50:51.728 --> 01:50:52.189]  Stay with us.

[01:52:52.041 --> 01:52:57.345]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:52:57.545 --> 01:53:01.988]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:53:02.128 --> 01:53:03.369]  There is a chance
[01:53:03.869 --> 01:53:06.492]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:53:06.552 --> 01:53:07.953]  The New World Order?
[01:53:08.614 --> 01:53:09.395]  Can't imagine.
[01:53:09.655 --> 01:53:13.879]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:53:13.959 --> 01:53:20.886]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:53:21.006 --> 01:53:23.028]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:53:23.408 --> 01:53:33.654]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:53:33.994 --> 01:53:39.357]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:53:43.659 --> 01:53:44.940]  Order today and spread the word!
[01:53:58.064 --> 01:53:59.945]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:54:00.445 --> 01:54:03.347]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:07.590 --> 01:54:10.051]  I've got a ton of other news from around the globe.
[01:54:11.712 --> 01:54:18.536]  Really important info coming up the next hour, but we got loaded phones wanting to talk to our guest and I was just going to have him on for 30 minutes.
[01:54:19.477 --> 01:54:21.380]  I don't know if he can stay with us.
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:24.403]  If you've got to go, Troy Newman, I understand.
[01:54:24.423 --> 01:54:26.066]  Or do you want to stay a little bit into the next hour?
[01:54:26.086 --> 01:54:27.848]  I could probably stay another ten minutes.
[01:54:28.349 --> 01:54:29.150]  Okay, great.
[01:54:29.290 --> 01:54:30.792]  Then we'll keep taking calls here.
[01:54:33.214 --> 01:54:36.735]  Because it's, number one, the First Amendment.
[01:54:37.476 --> 01:54:44.238]  You have your truck there in Kansas, and they said, oh no, you can't have your truck with any signs on the side, but everybody else can.
[01:54:44.278 --> 01:54:48.760]  The buses, and the taxi cabs, and the trucks, and the beer trucks, and all the rest of it.
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:56.342]  And then a guy calls in and says, it's freedom, it's, you know, it's, I'm a patriot, and so I'm for people doing what they want with their bodies.
[01:54:56.822 --> 01:55:01.344]  But then he said, you better not come to my town with your truck, or I may, you know, come after you.
[01:55:02.805 --> 01:55:04.566]  So where is he on the First Amendment now?
[01:55:05.106 --> 01:55:06.587]  Well, it sounds to me like he's an anarchist.
[01:55:06.607 --> 01:55:10.548]  He wants to do what he wants, whenever he wants, and he doesn't want anybody telling him what to do, period.
[01:55:11.349 --> 01:55:18.191]  And that just defies any sort of general rule of order, and just societies must have a rule of law.
[01:55:19.292 --> 01:55:21.973]  We've got one, and he's got to abide by those.
[01:55:23.143 --> 01:55:26.566]  Okay, we've got a bunch of callers that agree with you, but we've got one more that disagrees.
[01:55:26.986 --> 01:55:29.848]  Mary in Maryland, you're on the air with our guest.
[01:55:29.868 --> 01:55:30.329]  Go ahead.
[01:55:30.469 --> 01:55:31.169]  Yes, thank you.
[01:55:31.430 --> 01:55:33.471]  I like your show except for this issue.
[01:55:34.972 --> 01:55:37.214]  I wish I had been aborted myself.
[01:55:37.454 --> 01:55:40.517]  I have done a lot of research and I would like to make a few points.
[01:55:41.858 --> 01:55:48.423]  My mother was not allowed to use birth control by the Catholic Church and pregnancy caused her complications.
[01:55:48.463 --> 01:55:50.645]  I think she had a condition called a fistula.
[01:55:51.465 --> 01:55:54.688]  Which is pretty horrific and it causes most men to leave their wives.
[01:55:54.789 --> 01:55:56.631]  Sometimes this condition can kill you.
[01:55:57.832 --> 01:55:59.073]  It can cause women to have no control.
[01:55:59.093 --> 01:56:00.355]  What does that have to do with you?
[01:56:00.855 --> 01:56:01.836]  Well, she abused me.
[01:56:02.437 --> 01:56:04.098]  She wanted me to follow the church.
[01:56:04.179 --> 01:56:05.300]  She wanted to make sure I never...
[01:56:06.434 --> 01:56:20.941]  And because somebody abused you, hold on just a minute, hold on just a minute, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, just because somebody abused you, you wish you'd have been killed, and now we want the government, I guess, running around because there might be some bad parents.
[01:56:20.961 --> 01:56:22.042]  No, no, that's not my only reason.
[01:56:22.482 --> 01:56:23.482]  She just figured my face.
[01:56:23.923 --> 01:56:25.483]  But I've been doing a lot of research over the years.
[01:56:26.064 --> 01:56:30.586]  There are a lot of horrible medical conditions that women suffer from childbirth that are not being acknowledged.
[01:56:31.186 --> 01:56:34.988]  Randall Terry left his wife because of the damage childbirth did to her body.
[01:56:35.934 --> 01:56:38.555]  And women are suffering these conditions around the world.
[01:56:38.695 --> 01:56:40.656]  A lot of Republicans have abandoned their wives.
[01:56:40.696 --> 01:56:41.296]  They're cheating.
[01:56:42.016 --> 01:56:47.698]  And so because there's, hold on, because there's evil, let's start killing more children.
[01:56:47.738 --> 01:56:49.319]  I mean, this is a really sick argument.
[01:56:50.780 --> 01:56:51.740]  It's a health issue for women.
[01:56:55.572 --> 01:57:04.014]  I'll put you on hold for a second because Leon in Colorado has an interesting story.
[01:57:04.074 --> 01:57:05.315]  Leon, tell your story quickly.
[01:57:05.335 --> 01:57:23.620]  I'm the last of four children and because my mother had a need for a hysterectomy because of constant bleeding from previous scarring or something.
[01:57:24.582 --> 01:57:34.847]  Anyway, long story short, she went to the doctor and he was wanting to give her a hysterectomy with me in the uterus.
[01:57:36.007 --> 01:57:37.788]  And she says, No, I'm pregnant.
[01:57:37.828 --> 01:57:38.749]  I can't have that.
[01:57:38.869 --> 01:57:42.290]  And he says, Well, you might not live and that's not a big problem.
[01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:44.391]  And he says, Oh, yes, it is.
[01:57:44.411 --> 01:57:46.412]  I am not going to murder my child.
[01:57:46.512 --> 01:57:49.553]  And he says, Well, you might not survive.
[01:57:49.634 --> 01:57:50.474]  And she says, Well,
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:55.541]  If that's the Lord's will, then I will be in heaven with my child.
[01:57:56.522 --> 01:58:07.746]  And I also use this to testify to people when I went to the Republican County Convention here to get a platform for pro-life.
[01:58:08.566 --> 01:58:17.309]  And I said, so, according to all of your arguments there, that since I was a protoplasm, I deserve to die and not live.
[01:58:17.329 --> 01:58:17.849]  Is that right?
[01:58:20.936 --> 01:58:21.376]  Are you there?
[01:58:21.476 --> 01:58:24.058]  Well, I mean, think of the love of your mother and the courage... I do!
[01:58:24.258 --> 01:58:33.102]  I mean, I love my mother and, you know, hey, um... I don't buy that argument about abuse because, uh... Well, we know where the honor lies.
[01:58:33.163 --> 01:58:34.903]  The honor lies in protecting the innocent.
[01:58:34.983 --> 01:58:39.126]  All these just flat-out satanic arguments against it are sick.
[01:58:39.166 --> 01:58:39.566]  Stay there.
[01:58:39.586 --> 01:58:41.227]  I want to get a comment from Troy Newman.
[01:58:44.747 --> 01:58:49.229]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:53.671]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:58:53.971 --> 01:58:54.511]  We listened.
[01:58:54.831 --> 01:58:59.813]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:59:00.073 --> 01:59:00.574]  We listened.
[01:59:00.954 --> 01:59:03.995]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:59:04.415 --> 01:59:04.955]  We listened.
[01:59:05.416 --> 01:59:08.577]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:59:08.797 --> 01:59:09.117]  I don't know.
[01:59:35.316 --> 01:59:36.278]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:59:36.298 --> 01:59:37.882]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:59:49.789 --> 01:59:50.429]  Big Brother.
[01:59:51.090 --> 01:59:52.171]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:52.872 --> 01:59:53.973]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:54.633 --> 01:59:55.434]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.195 --> 01:59:57.076]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.096 --> 02:00:01.380]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:06.004]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.568 --> 02:00:12.649]  Alright, folks, we are now into the third hour here.
[02:00:12.729 --> 02:00:14.569]  This is our last segment with our guest.
[02:00:14.609 --> 02:00:17.929]  We'll come back and take the rest of your calls on the issue we've been discussing here.
[02:00:18.350 --> 02:00:38.653]  It all began with a First Amendment discussion of how they have a truck with a picture of an abortion on the side of it, a dead baby, and they said, oh, you can't do that, and selectively had him arrested and fined, and he's facing six months in jail, and it's just horrible.
[02:00:39.261 --> 02:00:41.163]  Yes, and let me get to that in just a second.
[02:00:41.203 --> 02:00:42.425]  I just wanted to ask a quick question.
[02:00:42.485 --> 02:00:43.346]  Answer it to yourself.
[02:00:58.570 --> 02:01:05.212]  Listen to the callers as they come through, and the mental gymnastics that they've gone through in order to justify child killing.
[02:01:05.252 --> 02:01:08.073]  And it's what George Tiller does here in Wichita, Kansas.
[02:01:08.093 --> 02:01:11.394]  He's a member in good standing of his Reformation Lutheran Church.
[02:01:11.814 --> 02:01:15.435]  He brings in an apostate pastor to baptize these babies.
[02:01:15.975 --> 02:01:22.657]  He'll sell you a keepsake urn after he incinerates the bodies of these babies, after he baptizes them.
[02:01:22.877 --> 02:01:25.878]  He'll sell you the urn, put the ashes in there, and send you home with them.
[02:01:26.891 --> 02:01:29.132]  There's some bizarre rituals that he does.
[02:01:29.172 --> 02:01:30.533]  He'll take pictures of the babies.
[02:01:30.613 --> 02:01:36.295]  If you want to have some postnatal pictures of your aborted baby with a crushed skull, he'll provide you those pictures.
[02:01:36.335 --> 02:01:42.298]  There's a little room that he's got set aside in his abortion mill where... Sounds like a snuff film production company.
[02:01:42.418 --> 02:01:51.079]  You know, that's exactly what I said, and I think he's got a very strange, bizarre mental condition, because it's a bizarre fascination with death.
[02:01:51.099 --> 02:01:51.940]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:01:52.020 --> 02:01:59.941]  Earlier, we were pretty nice to one of those callers, and then during the break, he just called up yelling, cussing, threatening, and I was just like, whoa!
[02:01:59.961 --> 02:02:03.262]  How are you going to stomp us into a mud hole and all this stuff?
[02:02:03.322 --> 02:02:08.602]  And I'm just like, man, I wish you had that much passion for these poor babies.
[02:02:10.623 --> 02:02:11.563]  It's amazing, Troy.
[02:02:13.137 --> 02:02:28.108]  It shocks me every time to listen to people's explanations as to why they think it's okay to kill children and I think it's very very simple that these are weak and helpless individual babies that are creating the image and likeness of God and we as men and women
[02:02:30.323 --> 02:02:33.506]  Uh, fully capable of protecting them must.
[02:02:33.606 --> 02:02:35.909]  We have a mandate in society.
[02:02:35.949 --> 02:02:38.652]  Well, I love this argument, is that nobody wants these babies.
[02:02:39.092 --> 02:02:44.037]  There are more people wanting to adopt every year than there are abortions.
[02:02:44.778 --> 02:02:48.902]  And I know people that, you know, adopt disabled children.
[02:02:49.183 --> 02:02:52.166]  You know, to answer Mary's question, I felt so bad for her.
[02:02:52.995 --> 02:03:04.583]  She said that she wished she had been aborted because of the abuse in her past, and I know that she's undergoing a lot of pain, and perhaps she feels that way, but the truth is, she still eats every day, and she still drives her car, and she still cares for herself.
[02:03:04.923 --> 02:03:06.404]  She doesn't wish that she was aborted.
[02:03:06.565 --> 02:03:11.228]  And I'd imagine there's people that love her, and I'd imagine she's touched a lot of people.
[02:03:11.848 --> 02:03:19.914]  I was adopted at birth, and perhaps I could go through the various stories of why I think that I should not have been adopted, and I should have been aborted instead.
[02:03:20.598 --> 02:03:29.787]  But the fact of the matter is I'm here and I choose every morning to wake up and put my pants on, put my boots on, and get out and make a difference in society.
[02:03:29.807 --> 02:03:34.311]  To make it better for the next children, the next generation, so that they're not abused.
[02:03:35.307 --> 02:03:37.148]  All right, well, you've got to go.
[02:03:37.168 --> 02:03:40.010]  We've got loaded phones here for you, but I'll come back and take those calls.
[02:03:40.090 --> 02:03:41.972]  And Mary's still there, I guess, in the last minute.
[02:03:41.992 --> 02:03:43.113]  You're doing a great job, Alex.
[02:03:43.513 --> 02:03:44.394]  Well, thank you, sir.
[02:03:44.434 --> 02:03:46.035]  Why don't you plug the website for folks?
[02:03:46.315 --> 02:03:50.838]  It's operationrescue.org, www.operationrescue.org.
[02:03:50.858 --> 02:03:57.183]  We've got an excellent expose coming out on George Tiller and all these bizarre things that we're talking about.
[02:03:57.843 --> 02:04:00.944]  And just give me an email, I'd be happy to get that out to you.
[02:04:01.384 --> 02:04:08.347]  Alright, well Troy Newman, President of OperationRescue.org, I appreciate you coming on and keep up your great work.
[02:04:08.467 --> 02:04:09.167]  God bless you now.
[02:04:09.828 --> 02:04:10.348]  Take care.
[02:04:10.528 --> 02:04:17.050]  And yeah, even if you're for abortion out there, could you disagree with Troy Newman for trying to convince women not to do this?
[02:04:18.131 --> 02:04:19.151]  That's his First Amendment.
[02:04:19.892 --> 02:04:22.432]  He's just trying to, you know, to influence people.
[02:04:22.453 --> 02:04:23.393]  It's free will.
[02:04:24.073 --> 02:04:26.094]  It's your free will to be evil or be good.
[02:04:27.023 --> 02:04:28.044]  And I am blown away.
[02:04:28.064 --> 02:04:33.647]  I'm going to have to do more on this because look at just the... some of the venom.
[02:04:35.008 --> 02:04:38.910]  And then some of the people that sound real friendly is going, well, nobody wants these babies.
[02:04:39.010 --> 02:04:41.071]  You know, it's abusive not to kill them.
[02:04:42.012 --> 02:04:42.672]  We'll be right back.
[02:04:45.287 --> 02:04:49.592]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.813 --> 02:04:54.218]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.378 --> 02:04:58.744]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.804 --> 02:05:00.145]  The New World Order.
[02:05:00.906 --> 02:05:01.627]  Panama.
[02:05:01.927 --> 02:05:02.708]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.643 --> 02:05:26.069]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:26.269 --> 02:05:31.672]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:53.373]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:05:53.593 --> 02:06:04.877]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:06:05.077 --> 02:06:07.718]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:06:08.078 --> 02:06:14.545]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:06:14.705 --> 02:06:16.567]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:06:16.767 --> 02:06:22.794]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:06:23.054 --> 02:06:28.700]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[02:06:44.662 --> 02:06:47.145]  Do you worry about the quality of the air outside these days?
[02:06:47.245 --> 02:06:47.726]  Pollution?
[02:06:47.766 --> 02:06:48.026]  Harm?
[02:06:48.086 --> 02:06:49.127]  Is it as healthy as you'd like?
[02:06:49.147 --> 02:06:49.648]  Allergies?
[02:06:49.808 --> 02:06:50.109]  Asthma?
[02:06:50.129 --> 02:06:50.689]  Probably not.
[02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:51.590]  Well, listen to this.
[02:06:51.811 --> 02:07:00.781]  Did you know according to the American Lung Association combined with the EPA, the air quality inside your home is actually 6 to 10 times worse than the air outside?
[02:07:00.801 --> 02:07:01.682]  6 to 10 times?
[02:07:01.703 --> 02:07:02.724]  How could it be you ask?

[02:07:45.112 --> 02:07:50.133]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show!
[02:07:50.513 --> 02:07:52.854]  Because there's a war on for your mind!
[02:07:59.875 --> 02:08:06.577]  Alright folks, we're now 8 minutes and roughly 20 seconds into the third hour of this global transmission.
[02:08:09.078 --> 02:08:10.638]  I'm gonna just run through
[02:08:12.803 --> 02:08:23.851]  Uh, the five callers we've got online, and then I'm gonna go, uh, the first five we've got here online, and then I'm gonna go back in a bunch of news we haven't gotten to yet, and then we'll take more calls after that.
[02:08:25.032 --> 02:08:31.196]  Uh, but, uh, Mary in Maryland was saying that she wishes she was never born, that she'd been aborted.
[02:08:31.216 --> 02:08:36.700]  And, uh, you know, I value your life, uh, Mary, and obviously you value it.
[02:08:36.760 --> 02:08:38.382]  You're, you're, you're alive right now.
[02:08:38.402 --> 02:08:41.344]  Uh, um, so, I mean,
[02:08:42.412 --> 02:08:46.195]  This culture of death seems to be really strong here.
[02:08:47.996 --> 02:08:55.102]  Your argument would make more sense if women did not suffer really horrific complications from childbirth, which I have become aware of.
[02:08:55.703 --> 02:08:59.786]  I lost a friend who suffered a rare complication.
[02:09:00.386 --> 02:09:02.688]  She had an estrogen-sensitive face cancer.
[02:09:03.268 --> 02:09:07.031]  And after she gave birth, her face cancer returned and it destroyed her face.
[02:09:07.932 --> 02:09:08.893]  Let me stop you again.
[02:09:09.668 --> 02:09:13.051]  What you're saying is, is that childbirth is hard on women.
[02:09:13.071 --> 02:09:13.451]  Yes.
[02:09:13.891 --> 02:09:19.055]  And so basically, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, this is life on the planet Earth.
[02:09:19.095 --> 02:09:20.856]  This is how mammals procreate.
[02:09:21.176 --> 02:09:22.517]  This is how we're here.
[02:09:22.898 --> 02:09:25.339]  You're saying the process of life, we're all going to die.
[02:09:25.800 --> 02:09:26.941]  We all have problems.
[02:09:27.461 --> 02:09:30.243]  Every man who lives long enough will get prostate cancer.
[02:09:30.263 --> 02:09:32.264]  So we just stop and kill all men at birth.
[02:09:32.465 --> 02:09:34.126]  So no one ever gets prostate cancer.
[02:09:34.386 --> 02:09:36.988]  Sounds like you have trouble with life itself.
[02:09:37.308 --> 02:09:38.209]  It's a process.
[02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:43.221]  Would you want to lose your wife in a horrible childbirth?
[02:09:43.361 --> 02:09:44.282]  I don't think so.
[02:09:44.362 --> 02:09:45.442]  Wait, what are you saying?
[02:09:45.462 --> 02:09:47.463]  You're saying that you wish you'd been aborted.
[02:09:47.483 --> 02:09:49.123]  I don't understand.
[02:09:49.203 --> 02:09:51.664]  I mean, are you saying... Well, my mother, she disfigured my face.
[02:09:52.885 --> 02:09:57.146]  And I would rather not have lived than for her to have trafficked me for medical experiment.
[02:09:57.166 --> 02:09:59.667]  Okay, ma'am, I'm going to let you go.
[02:09:59.687 --> 02:10:00.927]  This is too far out for me, okay?
[02:10:06.864 --> 02:10:10.129]  I mean, I am pretty freaked out right now, okay?
[02:10:10.389 --> 02:10:16.959]  Women have problems with childbirth sometimes, and it'll change their bodies.
[02:10:18.127 --> 02:10:28.550]  And so funny, every woman I know just loves childbirth, and it's the most magical thing, and they bloom after having children, and are just obviously the most amazing of the two sexes.
[02:10:29.470 --> 02:10:43.734]  And I want to thank my grandmothers, I want to thank my great-grandmothers, I want to thank my great-great-grandmothers, I want to thank my family line going back to the caves in Germany, and, you know, the mud huts in Scotland and in England.
[02:10:44.174 --> 02:10:45.314]  I really want to thank the women.
[02:10:46.073 --> 02:10:49.036]  And for being human beings and having children.
[02:10:49.536 --> 02:10:53.840]  And I want to thank the men who struggled to build this country with their wives.
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:56.182]  I mean, this is just culture of death, folks.
[02:10:56.383 --> 02:10:59.365]  I feel like I've walked into a loony bin or something.
[02:11:00.687 --> 02:11:07.653]  I know we got loaded phones with folks that have been wanting to agree, and frankly, we've been hanging up on people that agree so we could get people in that disagree.
[02:11:11.505 --> 02:11:14.448]  But I mean, when it gets that nuts, I can't even respond to it.
[02:11:15.008 --> 02:11:15.388]  I'm sorry.
[02:11:15.408 --> 02:11:16.749]  I'm not trying to be mean to you out there.
[02:11:16.990 --> 02:11:22.895]  I just, it's, I love life and I feel the evil growing everywhere in every way.
[02:11:22.955 --> 02:11:23.875]  I see it happening.
[02:11:24.556 --> 02:11:28.079]  Every form of wickedness and I'm blown away.
[02:11:28.299 --> 02:11:29.961]  I'm just, I'm blown away here.
[02:11:30.781 --> 02:11:32.623]  Let's talk to Wendy in Wisconsin.
[02:11:32.663 --> 02:11:33.503]  Wendy, you're on the air.
[02:11:33.564 --> 02:11:33.904]  Go ahead.
[02:11:36.448 --> 02:11:37.769]  Good to talk to you, Wendy.
[02:11:38.009 --> 02:11:48.898]  I wanted to tell you, I look at the Bible in Psalms 139 and it says, I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made, marvelous are thy works, that my soul knoweth right well.
[02:11:49.879 --> 02:11:52.361]  Many years ago, I'm a product of a person.
[02:11:52.521 --> 02:11:53.642]  I aborted a child.
[02:11:54.543 --> 02:11:55.784]  That was God's child.
[02:11:55.844 --> 02:11:57.205]  That was not for me to do.
[02:11:58.366 --> 02:11:59.246]  It has bothered me.
[02:11:59.266 --> 02:12:00.888]  I am a safe person.
[02:12:01.548 --> 02:12:03.170]  By God's mercy, I'm forgiven.
[02:12:03.390 --> 02:12:04.791]  But it's hard to forgive yourself.
[02:12:05.509 --> 02:12:11.095]  These people that are selfish, that want to destruct the life of a child.
[02:12:11.956 --> 02:12:14.378]  What part of God's Word don't they understand, Alex?
[02:12:15.359 --> 02:12:24.088]  We are a very, very, very selfish society and abortion has swoll the ranks of the New World Order.
[02:12:25.303 --> 02:12:31.828]  And once people have been involved in it, they become very hateful if they don't get out of it and repent of it.
[02:12:32.508 --> 02:12:36.791]  And they then promote every other form of wickedness.
[02:12:37.792 --> 02:12:40.694]  And it's just, I mean, I'm speechless.
[02:12:41.394 --> 02:12:45.837]  I can understand it, Alex, because these people that come on and say this, and Aunt Mary, my heart just grieves for her.
[02:12:46.318 --> 02:12:48.179]  I mean, that is totally wrong.
[02:12:48.817 --> 02:12:53.263]  I am so happy that my mom did not abort me, even though she believes in abortions.
[02:12:53.284 --> 02:12:56.468]  Well, she's saying, birth is tough on women, let's abort the babies.
[02:12:56.528 --> 02:12:57.309]  Well, that's wrong, Alex.
[02:12:57.329 --> 02:12:59.072]  That's the end of human existence.
[02:12:59.152 --> 02:13:00.714]  It's just, it's just death.
[02:13:00.794 --> 02:13:02.336]  It's death, death, death.
[02:13:02.537 --> 02:13:03.478]  Well, you know what, Alex?
[02:13:03.498 --> 02:13:04.780]  You know just as well as I know.
[02:13:05.495 --> 02:13:07.477]  God says we are born and we're going to die.
[02:13:07.677 --> 02:13:09.358]  That is a part of life no matter what happens.
[02:13:09.398 --> 02:13:11.800]  Well, yeah, I mean, what we're saying is life's hard.
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:12.501]  That's right.
[02:13:12.521 --> 02:13:15.823]  So, I mean, folks, if life was ten times harder, I would want to live.
[02:13:15.843 --> 02:13:16.464]  Me too.
[02:13:16.504 --> 02:13:17.905]  I mean, life is incredible.
[02:13:18.185 --> 02:13:18.485]  Yeah.
[02:13:18.726 --> 02:13:23.730]  The experiences, the smells, the, you know, the love, all of it.
[02:13:23.770 --> 02:13:30.735]  I mean, it's, this is, I mean, we're here for this small space in time, in eternity, in these experiences.
[02:13:31.656 --> 02:13:33.158]  You know, and that's what the Bible says.
[02:13:33.258 --> 02:13:34.080]  Satan hates it.
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:38.286]  He hates life, he loves death, and our culture is going to hell!
[02:13:38.526 --> 02:13:40.710]  Well, too, and he hates us for remaining in God's image.
[02:13:41.693 --> 02:13:44.295]  And the thing is, is I look at this and look where he's using it.
[02:13:44.555 --> 02:13:45.456]  Let's kill the babies.
[02:13:45.496 --> 02:13:46.036]  Let's do this.
[02:13:46.096 --> 02:13:46.837]  Let's do that.
[02:13:47.437 --> 02:13:47.937]  And we are.
[02:13:47.977 --> 02:13:52.761]  We are an incredibly decadent, pompous, self-centered society.
[02:13:52.941 --> 02:13:53.141]  Yes.
[02:13:53.601 --> 02:13:55.182]  And people want more and more and more.
[02:13:55.222 --> 02:13:56.223]  And let's get rid of all this.
[02:13:56.243 --> 02:13:57.144]  It basically is a disposable society.
[02:13:57.184 --> 02:13:59.805]  Well, they sold this idea of eugenics.
[02:13:59.846 --> 02:14:04.168]  Let's get rid of the infirm, because it costs us too much money in insurance.
[02:14:04.209 --> 02:14:06.170]  You know, it's just, it's sick!
[02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:09.172]  Well, I guess I'll be the next one, Alex, because I am a diabetic soul.
[02:14:09.628 --> 02:14:13.871]  Whatever happens, I'll be before my Lord and Savior, but that's the same thing.
[02:14:14.031 --> 02:14:19.115]  I mean, you know, get rid of these people, you know, they're handicapped, they're doing whatever, they're costing insurance, whatever.
[02:14:19.535 --> 02:14:24.378]  No, God says we're to be in this world, and when He takes us out, that's when it's supposed to be.
[02:14:24.978 --> 02:14:26.339]  Unbelievable, thanks for the call.
[02:14:26.459 --> 02:14:28.681]  Robert in Tennessee, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:14:30.762 --> 02:14:37.427]  And I was a blue baby at birth.
[02:14:37.567 --> 02:14:38.508]  What's a blue baby?
[02:14:39.290 --> 02:14:45.695]  It's where you don't, it's where your heart valve clogs up and you pass out.
[02:14:46.195 --> 02:14:47.776]  Oh yeah, the valves don't open, yeah.
[02:14:48.597 --> 02:14:52.559]  And they tell you to keep you off of the side you're laying on.
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:55.461]  What the family doctor said.
[02:14:56.682 --> 02:15:00.885]  When I was out born there, before they got me back to, I was born and home.
[02:15:02.126 --> 02:15:07.670]  And you know when you're out born there, it's gonna do damage to the brain when blood don't flow up there.
[02:15:10.456 --> 02:15:13.798]  Yeah, my father didn't start breathing, I think, for six minutes.
[02:15:14.418 --> 02:15:17.039]  He almost died, but he's got about 165 IQ.
[02:15:17.079 --> 02:15:19.300]  Much smarter than I am.
[02:15:19.320 --> 02:15:32.046]  I don't have 165 IQ because there's a car dealer that probably committed criminal stuff on me out on the motorway.
[02:15:33.026 --> 02:15:36.968]  They absolutely run my credit.
[02:15:39.468 --> 02:15:48.490]  And I hope the Veterans for Legal Rights Action Advocacy helps me out with the court suit against that.
[02:15:48.690 --> 02:15:51.450]  Hey, Robert, I appreciate the call, my friend.
[02:15:51.930 --> 02:15:55.751]  BD in Pennsylvania, then Jack, John, Phyllis, and others.
[02:15:55.791 --> 02:15:56.551]  Go ahead, BD.
[02:15:57.431 --> 02:15:58.151]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:15:58.351 --> 02:15:58.571]  Yes.
[02:15:58.611 --> 02:16:01.612]  Just to make it real quick and straight to the point, I'm not going to argue with you.
[02:16:01.672 --> 02:16:03.492]  I mean, I've got three wonderful children myself.
[02:16:04.872 --> 02:16:07.193]  It's kind of an ironic situation.
[02:16:09.514 --> 02:16:11.175]  Or say my wife was raped.
[02:16:12.436 --> 02:16:12.736]  Alright?
[02:16:13.056 --> 02:16:13.756]  Say she was raped.
[02:16:14.797 --> 02:16:18.039]  And, I mean... She wound up pregnant.
[02:16:18.779 --> 02:16:21.421]  I mean... I'm gonna let you go after this.
[02:16:21.641 --> 02:16:23.402]  I'm not gonna... What would you do?
[02:16:23.422 --> 02:16:24.322]  You know?
[02:16:25.503 --> 02:16:26.143]  What would you do?
[02:16:26.363 --> 02:16:30.005]  I mean... Well, I certainly... I certainly wouldn't blame that child.
[02:16:30.325 --> 02:16:36.709]  And I know a lot of women who've been raped that take a victory out of it and raise that child and it turns out to be a wonderful person.
[02:16:38.068 --> 02:16:39.609]  What I'm looking at is the husband.
[02:16:39.629 --> 02:16:41.829]  I mean, it's not the husband's son.
[02:16:41.929 --> 02:16:43.970]  You know, it's quite touchy.
[02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.810]  It's quite touchy.
[02:16:45.010 --> 02:16:45.830]  Well, I know this.
[02:16:46.030 --> 02:16:51.912]  I mean, let's say there was an axe murderer, and the police bust in, and there's a one-year-old child he has.
[02:16:51.952 --> 02:16:53.993]  I mean, did the police take the child to prison, too?
[02:16:54.013 --> 02:16:54.053]  No.
[02:16:54.893 --> 02:16:56.393]  No, this is a different human being.
[02:16:58.774 --> 02:17:00.775]  Look, look, these are the arguments, okay?
[02:17:00.815 --> 02:17:05.296]  And I mean, I think I've read there's a couple thousand rape pregnancies a year.
[02:17:06.218 --> 02:17:09.619]  And then they say, well, we've got to keep abortion legal for in case of rape.
[02:17:10.380 --> 02:17:17.782]  And so my question is, you know, somebody's wife is raped, so let's commit the bigger crime of killing the child.
[02:17:17.982 --> 02:17:20.283]  Well, the adoption would be the best route then.
[02:17:20.863 --> 02:17:22.684]  I was about to say, absolutely.
[02:17:22.724 --> 02:17:27.526]  That's what most of the women in the stories I've read give the baby up for adoption.
[02:17:28.326 --> 02:17:29.607]  And that, I mean,
[02:17:30.945 --> 02:17:32.687]  That's just a horrible story.
[02:17:32.747 --> 02:17:34.609]  I'm sorry that happened to your wife.
[02:17:34.649 --> 02:17:35.870]  It never happened to my wife.
[02:17:35.950 --> 02:17:37.692]  It's just a hypothetical.
[02:17:43.673 --> 02:17:45.555]  I mean, I was about to ask what happened to the scumbag.
[02:17:46.817 --> 02:17:57.109]  Again, they use these arguments, but then we have 45 million abortions, hundreds of millions worldwide, and now it's let's kill people begging for food and water.
[02:17:57.169 --> 02:18:01.294]  Well, let's allow the killing of children up to two years.
[02:18:02.955 --> 02:18:09.717]  And this is the government grabbing millions of children every year from good homes because they care about the children so much.
[02:18:09.757 --> 02:18:15.678]  The government's five times more likely to abuse your child in their custody than the same government promoting abortion.
[02:18:18.659 --> 02:18:19.779]  Thanks for the call, D.D.
[02:18:20.179 --> 02:18:21.079]  Jack in Colorado.
[02:18:21.139 --> 02:18:21.820]  Jack, go ahead.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:24.300]  Good to talk to you, Jack.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:25.200]  Good to talk to you again.
[02:18:25.961 --> 02:18:26.461]  Can you hear me?
[02:18:26.641 --> 02:18:27.141]  Yes, I can.
[02:18:27.301 --> 02:18:27.781]  Okay, good.
[02:18:29.127 --> 02:18:30.448]  So much I want to say about this.
[02:18:30.568 --> 02:18:45.716]  Back around seven years ago my ex-fiance and I had an abortion and it's true that it's something it's incredibly difficult to forgive yourself over knowing that I could be the father of a seven-year-old right now is painful to think about.
[02:18:46.596 --> 02:18:57.182]  And considering the cases of rape, it's just another example of how we need to be supporting each other in this life and
[02:18:58.337 --> 02:19:04.080]  How, you know, there are so many deep root issues that why would men even want to rape women?
[02:19:04.881 --> 02:19:07.422]  There's something really sick going on in there.
[02:19:07.978 --> 02:19:22.922]  And if there's anything worthwhile devoting socialized tax money towards, it would be towards supporting young pregnant women and helping them be good, responsible mothers who are going to be contributing to making this world a better place.
[02:19:22.942 --> 02:19:25.202]  But then again, you have an evil government who's pushing abortion.
[02:19:25.242 --> 02:19:32.384]  Any help they give is with the strings attached to break up the family and prepare that young child for prison as a prison laborer.
[02:19:32.404 --> 02:19:33.925]  I tell you what, stay there, Jack.
[02:19:33.945 --> 02:19:34.685]  I'll let you finish up.
[02:19:35.305 --> 02:19:42.146]  Make a few more calls and I'm going to... Tell you what, I'll take the folks that are online and then that's it because I'm going to get into news.
[02:19:42.206 --> 02:19:42.946]  Everybody stay there.

[02:23:48.061 --> 02:23:54.083]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:23:54.703 --> 02:23:57.724]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:24:08.948 --> 02:24:13.050]  You know, we have a country made up of people that are wimps.
[02:24:14.932 --> 02:24:15.692]  And I hate to say that.
[02:24:15.832 --> 02:24:16.633]  I am too.
[02:24:16.673 --> 02:24:20.595]  I told the story earlier this week of I couldn't find my baseball cap.
[02:24:22.496 --> 02:24:24.377]  I wear a baseball cap when I go to the gym.
[02:24:24.397 --> 02:24:25.817]  I've been going to the gym five days a week.
[02:24:27.078 --> 02:24:28.078]  For years I got out of it.
[02:24:28.138 --> 02:24:29.019]  I'm getting back into it.
[02:24:29.059 --> 02:24:30.660]  I couldn't find my baseball cap.
[02:24:30.860 --> 02:24:35.322]  And when I go to the gym without a baseball cap, I can't work out because people all recognize me.
[02:24:35.342 --> 02:24:38.784]  I was at the number one TV show in Austin according to Reader's Poll.
[02:24:39.084 --> 02:24:39.924]  I'm not bragging.
[02:24:40.104 --> 02:24:41.185]  I'm just explaining the story.
[02:24:42.432 --> 02:24:43.533]  And I can't get a workout in.
[02:24:43.593 --> 02:24:46.535]  But for some reason, if I wear a baseball cap, people don't come over to me.
[02:24:48.037 --> 02:25:00.247]  And so I couldn't go to the... I'd gone to the gym a few days without it, and I couldn't get anything done, so I'd gotten off the TV show, and everything was closed, except for Slave Mart.
[02:25:01.708 --> 02:25:02.408]  And I get it.
[02:25:03.129 --> 02:25:10.015]  I get on air and tell you not to go to Walmart, and then I pull into Walmart, and I go into Walmart,
[02:25:11.007 --> 02:25:12.188]  And I buy the goods.
[02:25:13.228 --> 02:25:17.891]  I ended up buying some batteries and a blue baseball cap.
[02:25:19.012 --> 02:25:23.315]  I couldn't find one that wasn't made in China, so I had to go buy a Remington baseball cap.
[02:25:23.375 --> 02:25:27.757]  I did find some made in Mexico stuff in the sporting goods area.
[02:25:29.238 --> 02:25:32.020]  So, that's kind of how it works with abortion.
[02:25:33.081 --> 02:25:35.262]  A lot of people have been involved in abortions.
[02:25:37.543 --> 02:25:40.025]  And so, instead of admitting that you're wrong about it,
[02:25:41.970 --> 02:25:43.050]  You just make excuses.
[02:25:44.691 --> 02:25:46.011]  And look at where it's led us.
[02:25:46.131 --> 02:25:47.372]  Hitler was for abortion.
[02:25:48.092 --> 02:25:49.392]  Hitler was for gun control.
[02:25:50.613 --> 02:25:55.634]  You go, well, maybe Hitler was, you know, some of the liberals will go, well, he didn't have all bad ideas.
[02:25:56.555 --> 02:25:59.735]  We've got a lot of liberals listening to this show because I'll expose Bush.
[02:26:01.896 --> 02:26:03.117]  Okay?
[02:26:03.837 --> 02:26:07.618]  And a lot of you have woken up to the new world order, but you still have a lot of your old ideas.
[02:26:09.451 --> 02:26:12.914]  And somebody to say, hey, you've lost a lot of listeners, you know, saying you're against abortion.
[02:26:12.954 --> 02:26:13.714]  I could care less.
[02:26:15.296 --> 02:26:20.440]  I mean, they could stick my head in a guillotine right now and say, renounce your beliefs or we'll cut your head off.
[02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:23.422]  I'd say, well, go ahead and pull the switch, Bubba.
[02:26:25.344 --> 02:26:27.846]  I mean, I've been through a lot I don't talk about, folks.
[02:26:28.046 --> 02:26:32.550]  I'm not going to stop for any thing, for anybody, because I know I'm right.
[02:26:34.187 --> 02:26:36.631]  And you can tell me, well, don't thump your Bible on me.
[02:26:36.731 --> 02:26:40.356]  Well, just common sense, not even the Bible tells us this is all wrong.
[02:26:40.376 --> 02:26:41.437]  But yes, I am a Christian.
[02:26:41.638 --> 02:26:45.563]  Does that mean I'm a neocon whore telling you how good the Patriot Act is?
[02:26:45.703 --> 02:26:45.944]  No.
[02:26:45.964 --> 02:26:49.348]  Does it mean I'm telling you how good George Bush is?
[02:26:49.448 --> 02:26:49.609]  No.
[02:26:51.664 --> 02:26:55.086]  But, uh, you know, turn on the news, turn on the TV shows.
[02:26:55.146 --> 02:27:01.550]  Half the sitcoms are about witches, they're promoting Harry Potter in all the schools, they're promoting Eastern mysticism in all the big corporations.
[02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:03.111]  But that's all okay.
[02:27:03.151 --> 02:27:04.091]  Hey, that's all right.
[02:27:04.371 --> 02:27:12.476]  Why are you so threatened by a religion that says, don't cheat on your wife, don't, uh, you know, commit murder, don't kill innocent people?
[02:27:14.830 --> 02:27:16.211]  Why are you so threatened by that?
[02:27:16.811 --> 02:27:22.033]  You think it's all designed to make your life easy, and the New World Order's made it real easy for you.
[02:27:23.494 --> 02:27:28.076]  They have greased the skids right into a vat of lava for your hind end.
[02:27:29.076 --> 02:27:31.297]  You're not going to have to wait to die and go to hell.
[02:27:31.317 --> 02:27:32.638]  Let's say you don't believe in hell.
[02:27:32.918 --> 02:27:34.539]  Well, I think Stalin created hell.
[02:27:34.559 --> 02:27:35.879]  I think Hitler created hell.
[02:27:36.199 --> 02:27:37.080]  Mao created hell.
[02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:39.441]  Kim Jong Il created hell in North Korea.
[02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:45.150]  So when you become decadent, or ignorant, or dumbed down, or enslaved, you get hell on earth.
[02:27:47.493 --> 02:27:48.414]  You get hell on earth.
[02:27:48.454 --> 02:27:50.016]  You're not going to have to wait, folks.
[02:27:50.776 --> 02:27:52.298]  You're going to enjoy it right here.
[02:27:54.461 --> 02:27:58.926]  And, you know, you can say, well, I don't believe in your rape what you sow.
[02:27:58.946 --> 02:28:01.449]  Well, that's ridiculous, even if you don't believe in God.
[02:28:02.625 --> 02:28:17.876]  If you've got a decadent corrupt society of neighbors that don't care about neighbors, and families that don't care about families, and governments run by corrupt people, the population that's given up on standing up against corruption and just accepted it, you get a waxing wickedness.
[02:28:17.896 --> 02:28:19.757]  You get an expansion of corruption.
[02:28:19.957 --> 02:28:20.838]  It always happens!
[02:28:22.539 --> 02:28:29.544]  And the most evil people rise to positions of power because only they can live with themselves and carry out the evil.
[02:28:29.564 --> 02:28:30.425]  They don't have a conscience.
[02:28:32.643 --> 02:28:38.828]  And so being moral, being upright, having standards builds a successful society.
[02:28:40.589 --> 02:28:41.650]  And it's very rewarding.
[02:28:41.670 --> 02:28:48.195]  You know, every time in my life I've done bad things, it's come back on me.
[02:28:49.856 --> 02:28:50.837]  That's just the way it works.
[02:28:52.358 --> 02:28:55.681]  And so God doesn't have to judge us.
[02:28:55.721 --> 02:28:58.943]  In fact, the Bible says He just lets our own evil come back on us.
[02:28:59.304 --> 02:29:00.384]  He just doesn't protect us.
[02:29:00.705 --> 02:29:02.026]  God just steps out of the way.
[02:29:03.922 --> 02:29:04.622]  That's what happens.
[02:29:07.523 --> 02:29:10.605]  You know, we allow 45 million abortions.
[02:29:12.385 --> 02:29:15.166]  So we're going to have a government that's going to kill all of us when we're old or sick.
[02:29:16.427 --> 02:29:19.448]  All these folks that are for abortion are going to, you know, have their lives cut short.
[02:29:21.289 --> 02:29:22.549]  And a lot of us who are against it.
[02:29:22.569 --> 02:29:25.150]  You know, we're all just in this big pot together now.
[02:29:25.991 --> 02:29:30.993]  We'll come back, take five more calls, and I mean just bam, bam, bam, and then I'm going into a bunch of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:29:31.533 --> 02:29:32.033]  Stay with us.
[02:29:34.778 --> 02:29:37.785]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:38.708 --> 02:29:41.394]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:46.164 --> 02:29:48.205]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:29:48.385 --> 02:29:50.026]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot!
[02:29:50.146 --> 02:29:58.130]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:29:58.390 --> 02:30:04.833]  Imagine, hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:30:04.993 --> 02:30:06.233]  Just a few of the many selections.

[02:30:09.975 --> 02:30:13.577]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disaster.
[02:30:13.757 --> 02:30:19.219]  The Long Life Food Depot was recently mentioned in the USA Today article on the very subject of emergency preparations.
[02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:22.281]  It makes sense to be prepared and Long Life Food Depot makes it easy.
[02:30:22.481 --> 02:30:26.502]  Long-term storable MREs make for convenience when camping, hiking or canoeing.

[02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:49.830]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:53.491]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:30:53.711 --> 02:30:56.171]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:30:56.431 --> 02:31:05.013]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:31:05.373 --> 02:31:11.154]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.

[02:32:41.593 --> 02:32:43.354]  Box 1227, Jacksonville, Oregon, 97530.
[02:32:43.654 --> 02:32:55.116]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[02:32:55.196 --> 02:32:58.857]  We'll take a few final calls, get into some other key news today.
[02:32:58.957 --> 02:33:01.338]  An amazing show, very revealing.
[02:33:02.868 --> 02:33:12.036]  Last night, one of my friends came up to the TV studio and he said, yeah, I took a bunch of old books to Half Price Books in Austin, big chain here in Texas, to sell them.
[02:33:13.937 --> 02:33:23.746]  And I was gonna, you know, sell them, and I went back to the back and they pulled out a big police ledger with APD on it, filling out my name and driver's license number and the books I was selling them.
[02:33:24.862 --> 02:33:25.402]  All of that.
[02:33:25.603 --> 02:33:29.504]  And then, you know, they claimed, oh, well, it's the new pawn shop law we have to do now.
[02:33:31.105 --> 02:33:32.566]  See how that sounds good before?
[02:33:32.706 --> 02:33:35.567]  Oh, at pawn shops, you've got to mark down what you sold in case it's stolen.
[02:33:35.587 --> 02:33:38.129]  Now it's what books you're selling.
[02:33:38.889 --> 02:33:45.752]  And Barnes and Nobles and Borders have admitted that the FBI demands the book purchase records, what you're reading.
[02:33:46.713 --> 02:33:50.274]  It's happening in the libraries now.
[02:33:50.354 --> 02:33:51.535]  And it's all the Patriot Act.
[02:33:53.300 --> 02:34:05.163]  And I'd forgotten about that, and I decided during the break to call Half Price Books, and I talked to them for about two minutes, and I said, yeah, yeah, everybody, everything you sell us, it's all marked down in the police ledger, and a record of it is sent to the police department.
[02:34:06.944 --> 02:34:13.905]  And I had a call yesterday, and he said, well, you know, the Library Association's liberal, and they're against the Patriot Act and knowing what we read.
[02:34:14.186 --> 02:34:17.466]  How do you defend yourself being, you know, basically in with those liberals?
[02:34:18.347 --> 02:34:19.327]  What does that even mean?
[02:34:20.691 --> 02:34:23.573]  You know, that we don't want what we read being marked down as a record.
[02:34:23.633 --> 02:34:25.835]  And, well, that's a liberal group that's against that sort.
[02:34:26.215 --> 02:34:27.116]  Are you a liberal?
[02:34:27.896 --> 02:34:31.459]  You know, it's just any way to not face what's happening.
[02:34:32.600 --> 02:34:36.843]  And, uh, here we have, you know, just calmly you go in at half-price books, that's what they do, is buy your books.
[02:34:37.544 --> 02:34:46.590]  And now you go in, and whether it's one book or fifty, I was asking her, uh, they, uh, mark down everything about it, and it goes in a big official police ledger that they store.
[02:34:47.071 --> 02:34:48.392]  Storing what we read!
[02:34:48.432 --> 02:34:50.113]  Why, it might have been stolen books.
[02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:52.561]  This is just incredible.
[02:34:53.602 --> 02:34:59.125]  But let's go back to Jack in Colorado and let him finish up what he was saying, that John, Phyllis, Jim, and Rebecca, and that's it for calls.
[02:34:59.645 --> 02:35:00.266]  Go ahead, Jack.
[02:35:00.566 --> 02:35:01.326]  Okay, thanks, Alex.
[02:35:01.467 --> 02:35:07.730]  Really quickly, I go to a really great school, even though it's hopelessly liberal, it's full of really wonderful people.
[02:35:08.091 --> 02:35:14.715]  And there's going to be what looks like a New World Order forum led by Jim Garrison and Bernard Leader about their book, America as Empire.
[02:35:15.259 --> 02:35:15.559]  Yes, we are.
[02:35:25.708 --> 02:35:31.751]  303-245-4800, and I was hoping you could give me a suggestion of a line of questioning.
[02:35:32.031 --> 02:35:45.297]  If I get an opportunity to ask them a question, what could I say that would do a good job of exposing what they're about to the public in a way that people will... Well, Gorbachev, and thanks for the call, Gorbachev is the left-wing arm of the New World Order.
[02:35:45.357 --> 02:35:47.438]  He was on the base closing commission.
[02:35:47.478 --> 02:35:49.679]  He's been given the Presidio base in San Francisco.
[02:35:50.659 --> 02:35:55.763]  And they give you a left-wing and a right-wing brand-new world order, but it's administered identically.
[02:35:55.803 --> 02:35:56.643]  It's the same system.
[02:35:57.384 --> 02:36:04.809]  And so I would just expose them on that fact, and I'd also go through, you know, how Russia was never really reformed.
[02:36:04.829 --> 02:36:09.773]  They just went, quote, from communism to fascism, which is really the same thing, command and control.
[02:36:12.797 --> 02:36:15.479]  I would tell him shame on you for trying to act like the U.N.
[02:36:15.539 --> 02:36:20.323]  is the good liberal world government and Bush is the evil right-wing government when it's all the same system.
[02:36:20.343 --> 02:36:21.284]  I would expose that.
[02:36:22.244 --> 02:36:23.545]  John in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:36:24.987 --> 02:36:28.990]  Yeah, Gorbachev was arrested by Yeltsin for stealing $3 billion.
[02:36:29.070 --> 02:36:30.771]  That might be one interesting point.
[02:36:31.672 --> 02:36:35.195]  Alex, have you seen the silent movie Cabarita about Molech?
[02:36:36.718 --> 02:36:37.358]  Uh, no I haven't.
[02:36:37.418 --> 02:36:43.962]  It's an Italian 1914, has a giant statue of Molek, where a Roman cult cooks children alive.
[02:36:44.002 --> 02:36:45.302]  I mean, it's creepy.
[02:36:45.342 --> 02:36:46.803]  It looked just like Bohemian Grove.
[02:36:46.883 --> 02:36:47.763]  Where did you see this?
[02:36:48.364 --> 02:36:49.784]  Uh, Turner Classic Movies.
[02:36:49.824 --> 02:36:51.345]  I don't know if it's on video or not.
[02:36:52.426 --> 02:36:53.566]  They've got it copy-guarded.
[02:36:53.606 --> 02:36:55.327]  You can't copy it off the TV.
[02:36:56.548 --> 02:36:57.048]  Oh, really?
[02:36:57.088 --> 02:36:57.768]  How does that work?
[02:36:58.769 --> 02:37:01.110]  Uh, it's the only channel that does that, fortunately.
[02:37:02.430 --> 02:37:05.332]  But, uh, how many abortions are done in America every year?
[02:37:06.846 --> 02:37:08.527]  I think it's what, four and a half million?
[02:37:10.168 --> 02:37:18.955]  Well, add to that 300,000 confessed iatrogenic murders by doctors, so doctors kill nearly 5 million Americans a year.
[02:37:18.975 --> 02:37:23.858]  So you've got to balance the... And they no longer give the Hippocratic Oath either.
[02:37:24.519 --> 02:37:25.279]  Do no harm.
[02:37:25.319 --> 02:37:25.940]  That's gone.
[02:37:26.060 --> 02:37:30.103]  And you've got to add 60 million genocides of Indians and African slaves.
[02:37:30.959 --> 02:37:32.661]  You know, we're in dangerous times.
[02:37:32.701 --> 02:37:38.526]  Well, you know, those African slaves weren't having a good time in Africa, so what if half of them died on the ships over?
[02:37:38.606 --> 02:37:41.849]  You know, they would have been abused as children, so we just killed them.
[02:37:42.069 --> 02:37:44.071]  You know, that's the argument we heard.
[02:37:44.431 --> 02:37:53.919]  Well, the argument some of the black professors make is that they would have, you know, escaped and blended into society, but being the wrong skin color, they couldn't blend in.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:57.983]  So it's not like they were inferior, it's just that their skin color
[02:37:58.502 --> 02:38:00.763]  Did not allow them to blend in if they escaped.
[02:38:03.185 --> 02:38:09.568]  It's amazing, but according to these arguments, well, you know, those Africans wouldn't have had good lives, so so what if half of them died on the ships?
[02:38:09.608 --> 02:38:10.829]  You know, abortion's good.
[02:38:10.849 --> 02:38:12.030]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:13.411 --> 02:38:14.671]  It's totally sick, folks.
[02:38:15.732 --> 02:38:21.775]  Let's go ahead now and let us speak to Phyllis in Missouri.
[02:38:21.835 --> 02:38:22.516]  Phyllis, go ahead.
[02:38:22.990 --> 02:38:46.654]  Hi, Alex, I was listening to church and D. James Kennedy, the minister, was saying that young women who have abortions have something like an 800% chance of getting breast cancer because of all of the hormones that are in your body designed to make the baby just so fluey.
[02:38:47.390 --> 02:38:49.932]  And they develop breast cancer.
[02:38:50.032 --> 02:38:52.514]  Well, that's not their opinion.
[02:38:52.654 --> 02:38:54.695]  I've seen the major medical reports.
[02:38:55.596 --> 02:39:04.822]  I don't have them in front of me, but it is almost a thousand percent increase in a bunch of different cervical, breast, you name it, because it messes up the whole cycle.
[02:39:04.842 --> 02:39:12.307]  But when a woman brings a baby to term, that then massively reduces, for each child they have, the amount of breast cancer and other cancers they have.
[02:39:12.527 --> 02:39:13.948]  And when a woman breastfeeds,
[02:39:15.189 --> 02:39:23.042]  Even just one child, their lifespan, I think, the different studies, a woman's lifespan for every child she has increases by six years.
[02:39:23.343 --> 02:39:25.526]  A woman breastfeeds, it increases by eight years.
[02:39:26.622 --> 02:39:33.704]  So you talk about fountain of youth, I mean, absolutely, but you terminate that, it just, it runs haywire in you.
[02:39:34.424 --> 02:39:39.365]  And then I think in middle age, they end up getting uterus cancer, women who have abortions.
[02:39:39.385 --> 02:39:43.646]  Yeah, and all those different diseases all increase.
[02:39:44.186 --> 02:39:45.707]  Well, they're killing the mothers, too.
[02:39:46.387 --> 02:39:49.567]  According to this earlier lady, it's very hard on women.
[02:39:49.607 --> 02:39:50.668]  Birth is a bad thing.
[02:39:53.628 --> 02:39:55.830]  This is what we're designed to do, folks.
[02:39:57.010 --> 02:40:02.254]  I don't have to explain this, but... It's a big penalty if you mess up nature.
[02:40:03.795 --> 02:40:04.455]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:05.096 --> 02:40:05.936]  Very informative.
[02:40:05.976 --> 02:40:07.457]  And yes, you're right, I should have pointed that out.
[02:40:08.218 --> 02:40:09.578]  Jim in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:40:09.699 --> 02:40:10.639]  Yeah, God bless you.
[02:40:10.679 --> 02:40:11.980]  A couple short things.
[02:40:12.100 --> 02:40:17.444]  My mother told me, she says, Jim, if it was between me and the baby, the new life gets the chance.
[02:40:18.124 --> 02:40:19.445]  That's another soul for heaven.
[02:40:19.865 --> 02:40:22.607]  This is just a testing deal, and it's a short life.
[02:40:23.348 --> 02:40:25.509]  Our home is not here, it's in the next life.
[02:40:26.290 --> 02:40:32.854]  And I saw a bumper sticker and I had one found it again and wrote it down.
[02:40:33.955 --> 02:40:39.558]  My God, they are treating the treasures of the womb like some kind of disgusting parasite.
[02:40:40.979 --> 02:40:42.660]  Oh, that's what they call it!
[02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:44.281]  I mean, well then look at yourself in the mirror!
[02:40:46.918 --> 02:40:49.539]  I mean, this is the life cycle.
[02:40:49.579 --> 02:40:50.640]  This is the miracle.
[02:40:50.700 --> 02:40:52.140]  This is humanity.
[02:40:52.180 --> 02:40:53.601]  This is the soul.
[02:40:53.621 --> 02:40:56.102]  It's better a heart burst than hell forever.
[02:40:57.863 --> 02:40:58.663]  Well, absolutely.
[02:40:58.703 --> 02:40:59.283]  Thanks for the call.
[02:40:59.323 --> 02:41:00.004]  Amazing points.
[02:41:00.584 --> 02:41:01.644]  These are all great callers.
[02:41:01.865 --> 02:41:03.825]  And again, the phone has been open if you disagree.
[02:41:03.865 --> 02:41:05.366]  We've had three or four of those today.
[02:41:05.406 --> 02:41:06.446]  I think that's a record.
[02:41:07.867 --> 02:41:09.968]  Let's talk to Rebecca in Texas.
[02:41:10.028 --> 02:41:10.628]  Last caller.
[02:41:10.668 --> 02:41:11.088]  Go ahead.
[02:41:13.469 --> 02:41:13.830]  Hello?
[02:41:14.050 --> 02:41:14.270]  Yes.
[02:41:15.169 --> 02:41:19.392]  Um, well, I wanted to say something, make a point, and I'll let you go.
[02:41:19.412 --> 02:41:30.981]  Uh, you know, people make choices, and it, uh, makes the little, makes the, you know, it makes, it affects people's lives, the choices they make.
[02:41:32.182 --> 02:41:37.847]  Yeah, people make the choice to go out and have sex, and then they kill a baby, uh, because they're selfish.
[02:41:38.427 --> 02:41:40.069]  Well, here's case one.
[02:41:40.169 --> 02:41:43.091]  There's a, I've got cases here.
[02:41:43.578 --> 02:41:44.859]  There's a preacher and his wife.
[02:41:44.899 --> 02:41:45.760]  They're very, very poor.
[02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:47.181]  They already have 14 kids.
[02:41:47.281 --> 02:41:49.522]  Now she found out she's pregnant with the 15th.
[02:41:49.542 --> 02:41:52.324]  They're living in tremendous poverty.
[02:41:52.404 --> 02:41:58.949]  Considering their poverty and excess world population, would you consider they get an abortion?
[02:42:00.443 --> 02:42:04.086]  Absolutely not, and that's a ridiculous case point example.
[02:42:04.126 --> 02:42:05.207]  Hey, let me stop you.
[02:42:05.267 --> 02:42:05.787]  Let me stop you.
[02:42:05.807 --> 02:42:06.307]  Let me stop you.
[02:42:06.648 --> 02:42:09.970]  Hutton Gibson had ten children and adopted another one.
[02:42:10.190 --> 02:42:11.111]  They wanted more.
[02:42:11.851 --> 02:42:14.533]  And did you know that the entire family is successful?
[02:42:14.974 --> 02:42:16.795]  It's not just Mel Gibson who's successful.
[02:42:16.815 --> 02:42:17.796]  They're all successful.
[02:42:18.156 --> 02:42:19.997]  I've met the family, a bunch of them.
[02:42:20.077 --> 02:42:22.659]  Beautiful, amazing, smart people.
[02:42:23.099 --> 02:42:25.121]  He has eleven children.
[02:42:25.141 --> 02:42:26.602]  I forget how many grandchildren.
[02:42:27.482 --> 02:42:28.403]  This is a joke.
[02:42:29.043 --> 02:42:33.066]  And this whole line about there's too many children, we're too overpopulated.
[02:42:33.386 --> 02:42:38.330]  The western world has a 3% on average loss of population.
[02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:42.573]  They have billboards in Germany and Italy saying, please have children.
[02:42:42.933 --> 02:42:47.556]  The third world is growing in population, but once you industrialize, that stops.
[02:42:48.117 --> 02:42:49.578]  So it's all a big fat fraud.
[02:42:50.098 --> 02:42:56.603]  Well, this case, one, what I read, if you said yes, you would have just killed John Wesley.
[02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:59.630]  I'm going to do this right quick and I'll let you go.
[02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:01.210]  The father is sick.
[02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:01.931]  Sniffles.
[02:43:01.951 --> 02:43:02.831]  The mother has TB.
[02:43:02.851 --> 02:43:03.791]  They have four children.
[02:43:04.251 --> 02:43:05.032]  First is blind.
[02:43:05.072 --> 02:43:05.732]  Second is dead.
[02:43:05.772 --> 02:43:06.392]  Third is dead.
[02:43:06.512 --> 02:43:08.713]  Fourth has TB also.
[02:43:08.753 --> 02:43:10.053]  She found out she's pregnant again.
[02:43:10.454 --> 02:43:13.915]  Given the extreme situation, would you consider?
[02:43:13.935 --> 02:43:18.356]  This person was Beethoven.
[02:43:19.016 --> 02:43:20.477]  If you would have chose yes.
[02:43:21.411 --> 02:43:24.794]  Third case, a white man rapes a 13-year-old girl.
[02:43:24.814 --> 02:43:25.554]  She gets pregnant.
[02:43:25.594 --> 02:43:27.336]  If you were her parents, would you consider?
[02:43:27.896 --> 02:43:32.080]  If you said yes, this was Ethel Waters, the great gospel singer.
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:35.162]  Case four is the last one.
[02:43:35.462 --> 02:43:36.623]  Teenage girl is pregnant.
[02:43:36.703 --> 02:43:37.624]  She's not married.
[02:43:37.664 --> 02:43:40.606]  Her fiancé is not the father of the baby.
[02:43:40.626 --> 02:43:41.887]  She's very upset.
[02:43:42.528 --> 02:43:43.949]  Would you consider abortion?
[02:43:44.089 --> 02:43:48.293]  If you said yes to the fourth case, you just declare murder on Jesus Christ.
[02:43:49.313 --> 02:43:49.714]  Okay.
[02:43:50.609 --> 02:43:51.751]  Absolutely, thanks for the call.
[02:43:51.771 --> 02:43:53.635]  Yeah, I've seen that before.
[02:43:55.338 --> 02:43:56.099]  Oh, man.
[02:43:56.119 --> 02:43:57.581]  Whoa.
[02:44:00.306 --> 02:44:02.851]  How people can't see what's right, right in front of their faces.
[02:44:03.988 --> 02:44:09.513]  But the society says it's okay, puts up these arguments, and you're young, and you go, oh, I can't do that.
[02:44:09.533 --> 02:44:12.435]  I'm having too much fun whoring at the bars.
[02:44:13.056 --> 02:44:15.038]  I'm having too much fun picking up all these women.
[02:44:15.058 --> 02:44:20.502]  Yeah, I'll just give 300 bucks to her, and then I won't have to worry about it.
[02:44:21.243 --> 02:44:26.828]  And then you just blasted something beautiful and wonderful that was going to take care of you when you were old.
[02:44:28.180 --> 02:44:30.361]  Now you're going to be alone on Thanksgiving.
[02:44:30.421 --> 02:44:31.982]  Now you're going to be alone at Christmas.
[02:44:32.522 --> 02:44:38.744]  Now you're going to die alone, old, in your apartment, with no children around you, with no nothing.
[02:44:38.784 --> 02:44:45.067]  You just took the greatest birthright, the most amazing thing we've got, and you flushed it down the toilet.
[02:44:45.087 --> 02:44:46.488]  You put it in an incinerator.
[02:44:49.829 --> 02:44:54.551]  And a lot of people are for abortion, but then they hear about these folks that are begging for food and water being killed by the government.
[02:44:54.651 --> 02:44:56.272]  I mean, we know of hundreds of cases.
[02:44:57.350 --> 02:44:58.731]  And they'll go, man, that's horrible!
[02:44:58.771 --> 02:45:00.032]  That's just terrible!
[02:45:00.052 --> 02:45:04.455]  Alright, let me, I'm gonna get into some other news here.
[02:45:06.676 --> 02:45:07.296]  Heaven help us.
[02:45:07.937 --> 02:45:12.480]  Before I do that, I didn't plug the videos last hour, I really should do it this hour.
[02:45:13.020 --> 02:45:25.588]  You want to be part of the solution, you want to wake people up to the concentration camps, the foreign troops, the loss of liberty, Patriot Act 1 and 2, homeland security, what the new world order is, get police state 3 total enslavement,
[02:45:26.365 --> 02:45:52.388]  You want to see Congressman Ron Paul talk about globalist-running Washington, the coming depression, who the neocons are, the New World Order, Colonel Craig Roberts, Frank Morales, Cynthia McKinney talking about UN kidnapping rings of children, 9-11, myself getting Patriot Act thrown out with local Austinites, Matrix of Evil, great new film, 9-11 Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,
[02:45:53.675 --> 02:45:58.600]  By the way, somebody mail me that video that John was talking about from Turner Classic Movies.
[02:45:58.660 --> 02:45:59.220]  What did he call it?
[02:45:59.461 --> 02:46:00.021]  Gamberia? 1914?
[02:46:03.098 --> 02:46:03.999]  Anyway, side issue.
[02:46:04.179 --> 02:46:05.720]  Get the films, folks.
[02:46:05.740 --> 02:46:07.681]  You need to get these videos.
[02:46:07.761 --> 02:46:08.881]  It's very important.
[02:46:08.901 --> 02:46:09.402]  You get them.
[02:46:09.442 --> 02:46:10.082]  Make copies.
[02:46:10.122 --> 02:46:11.203]  Get them on AXS television.
[02:46:11.223 --> 02:46:12.023]  Get them out to people.
[02:46:12.043 --> 02:46:13.104]  We're waking folks up.
[02:46:13.464 --> 02:46:15.785]  People's minds are very open to the truth now.
[02:46:16.106 --> 02:46:17.786]  They already have a lot of the pieces of the puzzle.
[02:46:18.067 --> 02:46:18.867]  They have the dots.
[02:46:18.907 --> 02:46:20.068]  They just haven't connected them.
[02:46:20.468 --> 02:46:22.089]  The films are all over two hours long.
[02:46:22.109 --> 02:46:22.449]  $25.95 apiece.
[02:46:22.609 --> 02:46:23.490]  Order three or more of any.
[02:46:26.312 --> 02:46:26.652]  I think so.
[02:46:49.937 --> 02:46:51.878]  Tito Howard with the Loss of Liberty video.

[02:47:08.764 --> 02:47:11.106]  And your purchase does make this show possible.
[02:47:11.146 --> 02:47:13.989]  That's also very important, but secondary.
[02:47:30.379 --> 02:47:32.721]  Alright, security reigns at Global Economic Forum.
[02:47:32.741 --> 02:47:34.002]  The military is surrounded.
[02:47:34.102 --> 02:47:39.687]  The World Trade Organization meeting in Cancun in Mexico and hundreds of millions of people around the world.
[02:47:40.468 --> 02:47:46.754]  And now the security around the Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland is even greater with the military called out.
[02:47:48.295 --> 02:47:53.480]  And at that meeting, John Ashcroft arrived and gave a speech about how CEOs
[02:47:54.615 --> 02:47:58.237]  Need to support the war on terror because it's going to be very profitable.
[02:47:58.677 --> 02:48:03.600]  CEOs at Forum assess Al-Qaeda as a business, and that's Associated Press.
[02:48:04.420 --> 02:48:07.122]  And they talk about how Al-Qaeda is a business for terrorists.
[02:48:07.162 --> 02:48:10.844]  Now they can have their own business countering that.
[02:48:12.244 --> 02:48:17.127]  And then we have Bush pushes for illegals, creating anxious nation.
[02:48:17.187 --> 02:48:19.068]  This is how messed up the neocons are.
[02:48:19.508 --> 02:48:22.690]  They were in such weird little personal relationships with Bush
[02:48:23.436 --> 02:48:26.620]  Remember, people call in and go, Bill Clinton, I feel like he's my father.
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:27.522]  I just love him.
[02:48:28.303 --> 02:48:29.044]  I'm his friend.
[02:48:29.104 --> 02:48:30.706]  I'm powerful because he's powerful.
[02:48:31.307 --> 02:48:32.669]  Same thing here with neocons.
[02:48:33.029 --> 02:48:35.673]  Bush's push for illegals creates anxious nation.
[02:48:36.153 --> 02:48:38.436]  Some in therapy threatening to leave U.S.
[02:48:38.817 --> 02:48:41.100]  want to send President Bill for counseling.
[02:48:41.877 --> 02:48:46.220]  Well, President Bush has enjoyed strong support for his handling of the war on terror.
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:47.500]  It's war on terror.
[02:48:47.740 --> 02:48:48.381]  He is not.
[02:48:48.921 --> 02:48:56.025]  His recent push to provide legal status to millions of illegal aliens is sparking a sudden surge in negative emotions among many Americans.
[02:48:58.127 --> 02:49:10.354]  And it says the proposal is also a new, frequent topic among those in counseling, with some calling it the last straw in their support for Mr. Bush as they deal with heightening fear and anxiety.
[02:49:11.564 --> 02:49:15.985]  They're taking it as a personal slap in the face from the presence of Sally St.
[02:49:16.105 --> 02:49:23.707]  John's, a Las Vegas-based counselor and relationship and self-help professional for Fox Television affiliate KVVU.
[02:49:24.367 --> 02:49:29.969]  They see it as selfish, self-serving move on the President's part and a personal betrayal and it is triggering.
[02:49:30.029 --> 02:49:31.849]  See, personal betrayal?
[02:49:33.050 --> 02:49:36.251]  I've had people go, Bush sent me a photo of him and his wife.
[02:49:36.311 --> 02:49:37.851]  He shined it himself.
[02:49:39.076 --> 02:49:40.136]  That's printed, folks.
[02:49:40.797 --> 02:49:45.098]  And it's triggering all kinds of family of origin issues.
[02:49:45.258 --> 02:49:47.079]  My clients feel betrayed, angry, and scared.
[02:49:47.119 --> 02:49:54.161]  It's like having a father that you trusted turn on you and you don't know what he's going to do next.
[02:49:54.681 --> 02:49:57.262]  That's how childish and idiotic these neocons are.
[02:49:57.462 --> 02:49:59.623]  They'll be licking his boots during the election.
[02:49:59.803 --> 02:50:02.284]  They'll thank him for signing the assault weapons ban.
[02:50:02.524 --> 02:50:04.205]  They'll thank him for campaign finance.
[02:50:04.365 --> 02:50:08.286]  They'll thank him for open borders by the time they're done and call me a liberal.
[02:50:08.926 --> 02:50:09.146]  St.
[02:50:09.206 --> 02:50:13.047]  John's and her clients are independently bringing up the immigration proposal during sessions.
[02:50:13.707 --> 02:50:18.568]  One is having anxiety symptoms like knifing pains in his heart and sweaty palms.
[02:50:18.588 --> 02:50:23.969]  The other one, a guy in his mid-forties is so anxious he told his mother that he's considering leaving the country.
[02:50:24.749 --> 02:50:32.670]  He wants to move to Australia because he's afraid that we're going to be invaded and the borders are going to be non-existent and then we're going to have no safety in this country.
[02:50:32.910 --> 02:50:35.951]  Why don't you go fight it and speak out against it, you little wimp?
[02:50:37.193 --> 02:50:41.717]  They say I feel like my father George Bush doesn't like me anymore.
[02:50:42.677 --> 02:50:43.938]  He betrayed me.
[02:50:45.479 --> 02:50:47.201]  I'm taking Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:50:47.281 --> 02:50:49.783]  I've gone from a size 12 to a size 9.
[02:50:49.963 --> 02:50:50.663]  It feels great.
[02:50:50.843 --> 02:50:51.884]  Absolutely wonderful.
[02:50:51.964 --> 02:50:57.488]  Well, here's another listener who's lost weight the safe and healthy way with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:50:57.809 --> 02:50:59.330]  Kimberly, tell us about your success.
[02:50:59.590 --> 02:51:01.972]  Okay, I've been on Vim and Vigor for almost two months.
[02:51:02.132 --> 02:51:03.033]  I've lost 16 pounds.
[02:51:03.613 --> 02:51:05.274]  And I've gone down three pant sizes.
[02:51:05.395 --> 02:51:06.055]  Incredible!
[02:51:06.255 --> 02:51:07.476]  I'm really excited, naturally.
[02:51:07.516 --> 02:51:11.219]  I have a 21-month-old child and losing weight after a child can sometimes be difficult.
[02:51:11.299 --> 02:51:12.100]  Well, that's for sure.
[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:12.860]  Was it easy?
[02:51:13.081 --> 02:51:13.681]  Very easy.
[02:51:13.741 --> 02:51:14.622]  I mean, there's nothing to it.
[02:51:14.642 --> 02:51:19.786]  You can actually still continue to eat meals with your children and not starve yourself or anything else and lose weight.
[02:51:20.026 --> 02:51:26.311]  I know you can lose fat the safe and healthy way just like Kimberly did with Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:51:26.651 --> 02:51:27.692]  Call right now 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:51:27.712 --> 02:51:28.032]  That's 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:51:28.073 --> 02:51:32.576]  Remember, mention you heard it right here and that gets you $25 off a three-month supply.
[02:51:32.756 --> 02:51:34.097]  So call Vim and Vigor today 1-800-622-THIN.
[02:51:34.117 --> 02:51:34.478]  Again that's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:51:45.246 --> 02:51:48.510]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:51:48.590 --> 02:51:52.775]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:51:53.015 --> 02:51:55.798]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:51:55.998 --> 02:51:58.401]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:51:58.581 --> 02:52:01.504]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to
[02:52:02.005 --> 02:52:03.165]  We're good to go!
[02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:22.571]  We're good to go.
[02:52:44.733 --> 02:52:51.576]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:52:51.896 --> 02:52:53.256]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:52:53.456 --> 02:52:55.657]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:52:55.817 --> 02:52:57.898]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:52:58.178 --> 02:53:03.120]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[02:53:03.460 --> 02:53:07.482]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:53:07.742 --> 02:53:09.503]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:53:09.583 --> 02:53:20.228]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:53:20.388 --> 02:53:22.289]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:53:22.489 --> 02:53:26.331]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[02:53:26.451 --> 02:53:28.012]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.

[02:53:38.796 --> 02:53:39.556]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:53:50.578 --> 02:53:52.498]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:53:52.978 --> 02:53:55.799]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:57.039 --> 02:54:01.500]  This article in WorldNetDaily is very sophisticated by Joe Kovacs.
[02:54:04.531 --> 02:54:14.456]  Because it goes on to say, don't worry, it's not amnesty, and you're good Republicans that would never vote against Bush, so don't worry, it's not amnesty.
[02:54:15.016 --> 02:54:16.256]  Folks, I've read the bill.
[02:54:16.356 --> 02:54:27.942]  It's blanket total amnesty in perpetuity for anybody who's here or ever gets here, total legalization, and it brings in unskilled workers, allows them to do that, to pay to bring them in.
[02:54:28.715 --> 02:54:32.417]  But this WorldNetDaily article, you ought to read it, and no one should support WorldNetDaily.
[02:54:32.437 --> 02:54:34.119]  They're a shameful organization.
[02:54:34.159 --> 02:54:35.039]  They used to be pretty good.
[02:54:35.459 --> 02:54:36.460]  They've totally sold out.
[02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:41.103]  I mean, they'll have a few good articles for every 50 that are just laden with propaganda.
[02:54:42.804 --> 02:54:47.267]  But the Republican National Committee says much of the anxiety can be attributed to confusion about the policy.
[02:54:47.768 --> 02:54:52.451]  A lot of people think it's amnesty, RNC Chairwoman Christine Iverson told WorldNetDaily.
[02:54:52.491 --> 02:54:53.271]  It's not amnesty.
[02:54:53.711 --> 02:54:56.613]  She says the RNC has received 20 calls on the issue this week.
[02:54:56.773 --> 02:54:57.334]  Yeah, right.
[02:54:58.183 --> 02:54:59.784]  All of which were against the proposal.
[02:55:00.384 --> 02:55:06.987]  Iverson believes once people thoroughly investigate the idea, they'll feel more at ease and support the proposal, and that it will grow.
[02:55:07.067 --> 02:55:16.152]  And they got a bunch of people going, the rest of the article, five pages of it, are, how good it is, and don't worry, keep voting for Bush, he's good.
[02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:20.314]  It is not amnesty, Bush says.
[02:55:20.334 --> 02:55:21.774]  I mean, what are they?
[02:55:23.735 --> 02:55:26.356]  Oh man, you know, he called it amnesty two weeks before 9-11 with Asante Fox.
[02:55:28.268 --> 02:55:29.728]  It's the biggest amnesty ever!
[02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:35.069]  Don't worry though, I've already had neocons confront me on the street and go, it's not.
[02:55:35.970 --> 02:55:37.150]  I like Bush.
[02:55:37.770 --> 02:55:38.870]  You liberal.
[02:55:39.390 --> 02:55:40.450]  Okay, I'm liberal!
[02:55:40.510 --> 02:55:41.251]  Ha ha ha!
[02:55:41.271 --> 02:55:43.051]  Enjoy the assault weapons ban!
[02:55:43.071 --> 02:55:49.632]  Uh, Washington soldiers' flights home still unpaid by the Pioneer Press.
[02:55:50.632 --> 02:55:52.993]  And uh, they're charging them for their meals too.
[02:55:54.042 --> 02:55:54.282]  U.S.
[02:55:54.322 --> 02:55:56.724]  War on Terror may spread to Syria, report says.
[02:55:56.744 --> 02:55:59.046]  A new report indicates that Syria may be the next target of the U.S.
[02:55:59.066 --> 02:55:59.686]  War on Terror.
[02:56:00.347 --> 02:56:01.928]  Yeah, try the PNAC documents from 2000.
[02:56:02.348 --> 02:56:09.453]  Seven states' info store a potent respiratory of personal data.
[02:56:09.533 --> 02:56:15.838]  A federally funded crime database run by seven states, including Ohio, is looking increasingly to privacy advocates like the potent
[02:56:17.282 --> 02:56:21.885]  Substitute for the data mining program the Pentagon scrapped after public rebuke.
[02:56:22.305 --> 02:56:23.866]  They never scrapped it, folks.
[02:56:25.907 --> 02:56:26.628]  Just amazing.
[02:56:27.208 --> 02:56:45.719]  Prince Charles, to be quizzed, Sky Television News, Britain's most senior police officer, will reportedly personally ask Prince Charles if he plotted to kill Diana, Princess of Wales, because her letter said Prince Charles is going to kill me in a fake auto accident, and she did die, and the evidence says she was murdered.
[02:56:46.630 --> 02:56:51.929]  Mars orbiter finds water, the AP reports, but you can't believe anything NASA says, that's the problem.
[02:56:53.054 --> 02:56:57.236]  We know there's water at the North Pole and South Pole of Mars.
[02:56:57.256 --> 02:56:58.037]  You can see it.
[02:56:58.357 --> 02:56:58.857]  Ice caps.
[02:56:58.917 --> 02:57:02.759]  But they make this discovery every few months to excite us.
[02:57:03.339 --> 02:57:06.481]  And none of us remember that the discovery was made 60 years ago.
[02:57:07.321 --> 02:57:09.822]  CIA, Iraq at risk of civil war.
[02:57:10.463 --> 02:57:21.188]  The CIA is saying that they told Bush the week before the State of the Union that it's about to erupt and descend into total civil war by the Shiites, even the groups supporting them.
[02:57:22.072 --> 02:57:28.639]  But Bush didn't care, he went into the State of the Union and lied as usual, because he's such a good conservative.
[02:57:29.580 --> 02:57:37.267]  And a lot of other news here, UM researchers, burning fossil fuels has a measurable cooling effect on climate.
[02:57:37.407 --> 02:57:39.069]  Well yeah, that makes sense, blocks out the sun.
[02:57:39.944 --> 02:57:43.949]  And the skies are 20% darker than they were 10 years ago, according to NASA.
[02:57:44.530 --> 02:57:56.924]  Atmospheric researchers have provided observational evidence that burning fossil fuels has a direct impact on the solar radiation reflected of clouds, thereby contributing to global climate change, cooling it down.
[02:57:58.942 --> 02:57:59.843]  A lot of time, folks.
[02:57:59.983 --> 02:58:01.303]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:58:01.864 --> 02:58:04.085]  Back tomorrow for Real Talk Radio from 1 to 4.

[02:58:15.511 --> 02:58:16.032]  Great site.
[02:58:16.052 --> 02:58:17.152]  Definitely want to check that out.
[02:58:18.793 --> 02:58:21.275]  And there's so much we didn't get to, but we did cover a lot of it.
[02:58:21.315 --> 02:58:22.595]  Great show today.
[02:58:24.056 --> 02:58:27.138]  Please visit the site, spread the word, and wake up!
[02:58:27.734 --> 02:58:29.918]  For the corruption and the evil all around us.
[02:58:29.998 --> 02:58:33.023]  Just because the world accepts it, doesn't mean it's good.
[02:58:33.043 --> 02:58:33.945]  We'll be right back.
[02:58:34.325 --> 02:58:34.706]  Tomorrow.
[02:58:35.836 --> 02:58:37.437]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:37.818 --> 02:58:43.542]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
