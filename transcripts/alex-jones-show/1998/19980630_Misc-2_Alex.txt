[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:04.270]  I mean, on a monetary basis, I mean, you're going to get what was yours back.
[00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.371]  I mean, you know, you act like everybody's going to be lost and be broke and everybody's going to be running around.
[00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:18.033]  Well, 80% of your big mutual funds and banks, I mean, I talk to people that are worth, you know, millions of dollars all the time.
[00:00:18.053 --> 00:00:22.814]  I mean, you know, for real, people that don't show it off and aren't big fancy pants people or whatever.
[00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:26.015]  And look, we're doing a lot better.
[00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:30.438]  I guess Warren Buffett, you know, worth $40-something billion, I guess he's a cook, too.
[00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:33.540]  I mean, this is serious.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.961]  This is serious.
[00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:36.422]  I don't know what to do.
[00:00:37.402 --> 00:00:39.023]  I'm a very passive person.
[00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:41.085]  I watch you practically every week, Alex.
[00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:45.968]  I've got to admit, a lot of you is entertainment as far as the reason why I watch you.
[00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:48.890]  But I think you've got a lot of good things to say.
[00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.612]  On the other hand, I'm one of those people that go,
[00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:53.478]  Okay, settle down.
[00:00:53.518 --> 00:00:54.559]  Everything's going to be cool.
[00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.679]  I think everything, you know... Really?
[00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.720]  What are you going to do?
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.720]  Do you have any elderly people that live around you?
[00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:05.401]  I just moved to my neighborhood just recently.
[00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:07.302]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:01:07.322 --> 00:01:18.044]  My grandparents, not my father's parents, but my mother's parents, live in a humble home with a nice backyard, and they worked hard their lives, and they're not rich.
[00:01:19.165 --> 00:01:20.485]  The IRS had to steal their house.
[00:01:22.597 --> 00:01:24.699]  Personally, I haven't seen that type of thing.
[00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:32.183]  You know, I did a story on Mr. Wheelis, 78 years old, World War II veteran, lives in South Austin in a humble home.
[00:01:32.724 --> 00:01:33.424]  He's had a stroke.
[00:01:34.585 --> 00:01:36.766]  Oh, I think I saw one on the porch.
[00:01:36.986 --> 00:01:38.767]  Bureaucrats target old people.
[00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:45.972]  You know, you sit here, they target them because a lot of times they can't stand up for themselves and they just get struck dry by the bureaucrats because they're getting a little bit old.
[00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:49.014]  You take Rowan Ellington, another World War II veteran.
[00:01:49.634 --> 00:01:52.556]  I live out there on West 37th.
[00:01:52.576 --> 00:01:55.499]  $2,000 a day fine for 3 inch grass.
[00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:56.419]  I showed you the ticket.
[00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.340]  I saw that.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.980]  I saw that.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.121]  What do you want from me?
[00:01:59.301 --> 00:02:00.963]  Don't you tell me this is entertainment!
[00:02:01.363 --> 00:02:02.364]  Oh, come on, man.
[00:02:02.464 --> 00:02:04.685]  Don't you tell me this is entertainment, buddy!
[00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:05.326]  This is real!
[00:02:05.486 --> 00:02:09.089]  Alex, I called you up to be... No, I'm sick of it!
[00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.250]  I'm sick of it!
[00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.251]  I'm standing up for the people, dammit!
[00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.812]  Oh, I understand that, man.
[00:02:13.852 --> 00:02:14.373]  This isn't an act!
[00:02:14.913 --> 00:02:16.333]  I'm a real person.
[00:02:16.373 --> 00:02:19.154]  There's some chivalry left in this country, buddy.
[00:02:19.174 --> 00:02:21.035]  I haven't had my soul sucked out.
[00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:28.277]  I think it's wrong that people can't sell their houses because of the environmental crap that corporations can go around and lobby the politicians to get out of it.
[00:02:28.497 --> 00:02:31.137]  Alex, man, I did not call you up there again.
[00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:33.298]  You don't have to get in people's face like that.
[00:02:33.318 --> 00:02:34.438]  I'm defending people here.
[00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:35.839]  I don't want you to kiss my ass.
[00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:37.659]  I want you to get up there and do something.
[00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.479]  I want you to get up and do something!
[00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.200]  And don't you tell me I got a problem, because I care about this country!
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.180]  I'm alright, man.
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.582]  I mean... You know, it's all I can do to not go out and confront those IRS people, but I'm afraid to.
[00:02:50.762 --> 00:02:53.642]  But as I grow stronger, someday I may do what it takes.
[00:02:53.962 --> 00:02:55.603]  I'm defending this Constitution.
[00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:57.103]  I'm defending this country.
[00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:58.043]  Things are wrong.
[00:02:58.083 --> 00:03:00.524]  You can believe the math psychology if you want to.
[00:03:02.664 --> 00:03:05.226]  I listen to people like you.
[00:03:05.286 --> 00:03:06.327]  I listen to everything.
[00:03:06.347 --> 00:03:17.174]  I get my stuff from all types of places and it seems like you only get your stuff from one place.
[00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:20.457]  I only get it from one place.
[00:03:20.697 --> 00:03:23.639]  They're telling you how wonderful biochips are right here.
[00:03:24.611 --> 00:03:30.859]  But see, here you go with your... The media tells us that there were no... Alex, man... Shut up and let me answer your question!
[00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.543]  The media tells us that there's... Because I have to counter your BS one thing at a time.
[00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:35.945]  The media tells us that there was no...
[00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:39.408]  That we didn't sell some non-chemical and biologicals.
[00:03:39.608 --> 00:03:43.251]  And then I've got footage that I've played a dozen times of U.S.
[00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:44.612]  biologicals in its bunkers.
[00:03:44.832 --> 00:03:47.193]  Ron Paul goes up and says, here's the receipt.
[00:03:47.734 --> 00:03:48.174]  Hang on.
[00:03:48.274 --> 00:03:52.417]  This company in Houston, James Baker, George Bush, boom, sold them chemical and biologicals.
[00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:53.798]  Used them on our people.
[00:03:53.838 --> 00:03:55.079]  We detonated gametea.
[00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:56.200]  Everything's a lie.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.280]  The Federal Reserve is private.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.281]  They banned gold in 33.
[00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.982]  They can turn it in for paper.
[00:04:00.122 --> 00:04:01.884]  The lies are so damn deep it's pathetic.
[00:04:02.284 --> 00:04:03.645]  You just accept all this crap?
[00:04:04.651 --> 00:04:05.651]  It's everywhere, man!
[00:04:05.871 --> 00:04:07.312]  I get my stuff from one source?
[00:04:08.012 --> 00:04:09.372]  People say I use mainstream media?
[00:04:09.392 --> 00:04:11.693]  They're here showing you about how great this bio thing is.
[00:04:11.813 --> 00:04:15.954]  No, you rely on a source when it tells you something you want to know.
[00:04:16.274 --> 00:04:16.434]  No.
[00:04:16.474 --> 00:04:17.894]  That's when the source is good.
[00:04:18.414 --> 00:04:19.974]  Otherwise, the source is crap.
[00:04:20.034 --> 00:04:21.375]  No, no, we have children right here.
[00:04:21.415 --> 00:04:22.735]  I talk about everything children.
[00:04:24.935 --> 00:04:26.416]  Saving play for a rainy day.
[00:04:26.436 --> 00:04:31.017]  Clinton looks to the future of China.
[00:04:32.751 --> 00:04:35.355]  Cheaper age regime may save thousands of children.
[00:04:35.895 --> 00:04:36.276]  Children!
[00:04:36.316 --> 00:04:36.676]  Children!
[00:04:37.037 --> 00:04:37.177]  Oh!
[00:04:37.598 --> 00:04:38.278]  Today's paper!
[00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:39.480]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:40.642]  The CHIP page.
[00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:41.543]  Children!
[00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:42.784]  The DNA chip.
[00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:43.886]  We're going to help children.
[00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:44.527]  Here.
[00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:47.994]  I'm not through smoking!
[00:04:48.014 --> 00:04:49.315]  Smokey, save the children!
[00:04:49.735 --> 00:04:51.375]  I'm not through China, the failing yin!
[00:04:51.395 --> 00:04:52.356]  We gotta help the children!
[00:04:52.796 --> 00:04:56.057]  Oh God, this guy's taking his kids fishing with his children!
[00:04:56.177 --> 00:04:57.117]  Oh look, look, look!
[00:04:57.298 --> 00:04:58.558]  Movies that are good for your children!
[00:04:58.578 --> 00:05:00.519]  This is a wholesome Disney movie for your children!
[00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:02.139]  Yeah, I answered your question.
[00:05:02.179 --> 00:05:03.480]  Let's go to video and I'll be back.
[00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:06.620]  You are propaganda!
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.181]  You are a child!
[00:05:08.322 --> 00:05:09.382]  That's what they want you to be.
[00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:11.885]  That's what the word child means.
[00:05:11.965 --> 00:05:13.946]  They want you to be the babies of the state.
[00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:15.768]  We're the children, dumbass.
[00:05:16.348 --> 00:05:17.089]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:19.211 --> 00:05:20.171]  I'll take your phone calls.
[00:05:20.972 --> 00:05:21.653]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:21.673 --> 00:05:22.674]  This is Exposing Corruption.
[00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:32.733]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:42.733]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:42.733 --> 00:05:52.733]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:52.733 --> 00:06:02.733]  [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:05:58.588 --> 00:06:07.193]  Um, I was, uh, wanting to run some more of the BATF agent, but, uh, she always has such a good studio audience, which, uh, which are my friends.
[00:06:07.213 --> 00:06:08.474]  Which are my friends.
[00:06:08.494 --> 00:06:09.835]  I have to make a rule, though.
[00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:14.698]  Um, we're gonna put the, just, just, uh, rewind, uh, this, uh, tape doesn't have any audio.
[00:06:14.718 --> 00:06:15.958]  This is just an image tape.
[00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:17.439]  Yeah, let's just play this.
[00:06:17.459 --> 00:06:21.302]  This is the Department of Transportation here in Texas, Texas Department of Transportation.
[00:06:21.662 --> 00:06:23.823]  We're talking about, uh, thumb scanning and other things.
[00:06:24.624 --> 00:06:25.744]  Right here on Exposing Corruption.
[00:06:25.884 --> 00:06:26.905]  And your job's gone, lady!
[00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:29.391]  And at the same point, uh...
[00:06:30.253 --> 00:06:32.735]  We see more and more of these smart highways and toll systems.
[00:06:33.215 --> 00:06:39.519]  And it seems to me like in the future, well it's not just the future, the April 27th issue of Time, the future of money.
[00:06:39.539 --> 00:06:40.860]  You can probably find one in there.
[00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:42.281]  Read on page 44.
[00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:50.087]  It talks about the best part, quote, the best part is the chip under your daughter's skin in the near future.
[00:06:50.427 --> 00:06:52.749]  You won't have to buy the drinks for her at the bar.
[00:06:53.049 --> 00:06:54.050]  And that's on page 44.
[00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.531]  That's the type of mental illness that's in our mainstream media.
[00:06:56.851 --> 00:06:58.553]  And I challenge you to go read that.
[00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:08.036]  Then they talk about tollways, and transponders, and one card for everything, and ships under the skin, and how wonderful it is, and the best part for your daughter is, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:08.076 --> 00:07:09.537]  Of course, it's always for the children.
[00:07:10.277 --> 00:07:25.002]  And you sit there and you read that, and then you realize, wait a minute, if the IRS doesn't like me now, and they're a bunch of criminals, that's been proven, out of control, if they don't like me now, they can come take my house away, but I can still mow yards, or be in the black market economy, selling shoes on the street, or whatever.
[00:07:25.939 --> 00:07:30.001]  Well, what if they, in ten years, have implemented this smart car and smart highways?
[00:07:30.081 --> 00:07:32.322]  You won't be able to get in your car, drive down the road.
[00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:36.304]  Your car will just turn off if you're not a good citizen or a good slave.
[00:07:36.964 --> 00:07:39.345]  Well, that would take a great deal of technology.
[00:07:39.405 --> 00:07:41.506]  They haven't even invented it yet to turn your car off.
[00:07:43.187 --> 00:07:45.488]  All the technology does now is it uses
[00:07:46.447 --> 00:07:52.473]  Uh, what, in effect, is a high-tech metal detector to read the speed of the car as it goes over.
[00:07:52.553 --> 00:07:53.934]  Well, now that's the K-Tech.
[00:07:54.134 --> 00:07:55.795]  That's the sensor in the road that makes it speed.
[00:07:55.815 --> 00:07:57.357]  It's all these integrated systems.
[00:07:57.437 --> 00:08:01.680]  And, you know, technology's doubling every four and a half years now, at this current rate.
[00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:09.347]  And the point I'm making is, is they do have systems, and it's been on Discovery Channel, microwaves that are harmful to people and other things.
[00:08:09.387 --> 00:08:13.591]  If they aim at your car for an instant, the engine will instantly stop.
[00:08:14.534 --> 00:08:16.515]  They're already making new cars.
[00:08:16.535 --> 00:08:20.997]  They have more and more transponders and things inside of them.
[00:08:21.237 --> 00:08:22.758]  I mean, again, this is not a conspiracy.
[00:08:23.058 --> 00:08:29.420]  If you go and read that sickening article in Time Magazine, The Future of Money, it is a six-page propaganda article.
[00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:31.601]  So we'll accept the technocracy.
[00:08:32.122 --> 00:08:32.822]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:08:33.302 --> 00:08:33.802]  I'm set.
[00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:34.603]  Well, we've reached that.
[00:08:34.663 --> 00:08:35.603]  I appreciate it.
[00:08:35.643 --> 00:08:36.463]  No problem.
[00:08:36.503 --> 00:08:36.764]  Thanks.
[00:08:36.784 --> 00:08:38.864]  We're about to get very, very maniacal.
[00:08:38.884 --> 00:08:40.084]  No problem at all.
[00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:44.964]  [Music]
[00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:54.092]  We're across the street from the Texas Department of Transportation, and we're fixing to go over there and talk to Mr. Hurt, their head person in public relations.
[00:08:55.413 --> 00:08:58.254]  We suspect that that is a camera pod.
[00:08:58.654 --> 00:09:07.677]  I've been telling everybody that those are what they plan to put cameras on, because in other cities I've seen poles just like that with a question mark wire, a lighting rod, with cameras.
[00:09:08.336 --> 00:09:10.437]  We're fixin' to go over and find out right now.
[00:09:10.437 --> 00:09:19.636]  [Sounds of a helicopter]
[00:09:19.608 --> 00:09:24.995]  We're here on I-835, right across the street from the Texas Department of Transportation.
[00:09:25.856 --> 00:09:27.798]  We're fixing to go talk to one of their head people.
[00:09:28.679 --> 00:09:34.066]  We suspect that that pole that you see right there, right next door to it,
[00:09:35.259 --> 00:09:37.200]  That they're planning to put a camera on top of it.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:42.144]  The reason we suspect this is that... I didn't see it last year, but I heard about it when I recorded.
[00:09:42.644 --> 00:09:46.527]  Cameras are on poles just like that with a question mark lightning rod.
[00:09:47.348 --> 00:09:49.609]  That's what you see there is a lightning rod.
[00:09:49.629 --> 00:09:51.110]  So let's go over and find out right now.
[00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:53.392]  Right here on Explosion Corruption.
[00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:54.731]  minimum report. Ah!
[00:09:54.731 --> 00:09:55.731]  . . .
[00:09:55.731 --> 00:09:56.731]  . .
[00:10:04.315 --> 00:10:05.295]  Hello Austin, Texas.
[00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:08.336]  I hope you're enjoying the show tonight.
[00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:11.257]  We're making a new rule.
[00:10:12.057 --> 00:10:14.877]  Nobody goes in the control room, and we have no reason to even do this show.
[00:10:15.858 --> 00:10:20.579]  Because every time five or six people come up and hang out in the control room, this happens.
[00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:22.559]  And I don't understand why.
[00:10:22.859 --> 00:10:30.481]  And look, I know this is all volunteer, but I mean, we've got to bring the public.
[00:10:30.501 --> 00:10:31.181]  This is important.
[00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:33.001]  And I'm not mad at y'all.
[00:10:33.662 --> 00:10:37.565]  I just, you know, if you guys show up to him for the show, you can still do a good job, which you do do.
[00:10:37.945 --> 00:10:40.648]  But we just gotta keep people out of control, and it's not your fault.
[00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:44.011]  You hear me, Lars and Eric?
[00:10:44.291 --> 00:10:45.452]  Y'all are in there causing trouble.
[00:10:45.492 --> 00:10:46.133]  Hello, you're on the air.
[00:10:47.434 --> 00:10:48.174]  Real fast, caller.
[00:10:48.194 --> 00:10:49.115]  Can you hear me?
[00:10:49.275 --> 00:10:49.636]  Yes.
[00:10:49.936 --> 00:10:51.297]  Eric's his recon son, Roger.
[00:10:51.537 --> 00:10:52.198]  Hey, what's going on?
[00:10:52.378 --> 00:10:52.918]  Oh, not much.
[00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:57.923]  I just wanted to tell you a little quick story that had happened to me in Seattle, Washington.
[00:10:58.542 --> 00:11:02.384]  I was driving over a bridge and a lady came up beside me and gave me the finger.
[00:11:03.164 --> 00:11:04.945]  So I gave her the finger back.
[00:11:06.445 --> 00:11:14.669]  And after the fact, I found out three months later after I got arrested, I was walking down the street and a cop asked me for my identification.
[00:11:15.169 --> 00:11:15.869]  Gave it to him.
[00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:18.090]  He says, will you have an arrest warrant for your arrest?
[00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:21.432]  So I ended up spending a weekend in jail.
[00:11:22.112 --> 00:11:25.313]  My mom had to spend $500 to bail me out.
[00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:26.794]  I went to court three times.
[00:11:27.538 --> 00:11:30.659]  The judge overturned it every time I went.
[00:11:30.679 --> 00:11:36.041]  Now listen, and because supposedly there was a gun involved.
[00:11:36.641 --> 00:11:39.483]  She had said that I had pointed a gun at her on the freeway.
[00:11:39.783 --> 00:11:44.244]  Well, finally she admitted to the court that she was lying.
[00:11:45.165 --> 00:11:48.246]  And I never spent no, you know, she never spent no time in jail.
[00:11:48.346 --> 00:11:51.507]  Look, you got a lot of little tattletales like that, and I really appreciate your call.
[00:11:51.527 --> 00:11:52.247]  That's a good point.
[00:11:52.267 --> 00:11:54.208]  We got a lot of tattletales, a lot of people.
[00:11:54.248 --> 00:11:56.149]  How are you on the air?
[00:11:56.189 --> 00:11:56.669]  Hello, Alex.
[00:11:56.991 --> 00:11:57.511]  What's going on?
[00:11:58.191 --> 00:11:59.191]  This is the artist.
[00:11:59.912 --> 00:12:04.833]  I just wanted to say thank you for showing my artwork, even though you didn't have to do that.
[00:12:04.853 --> 00:12:07.673]  Well, I did it very briefly, and I meant to do it the next week.
[00:12:08.213 --> 00:12:10.134]  My cousin wanted me to show it to him, and I meant to.
[00:12:10.154 --> 00:12:12.934]  See, that's how sweet Beckley is, and I'm mean to him.
[00:12:13.875 --> 00:12:16.935]  But, um, yeah, that's some really nice artwork.
[00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:19.936]  Well, what did you think about the article?
[00:12:21.004 --> 00:12:23.265]  They're really good, and I think they're in giant stacks of stuff.
[00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:25.925]  Literally, I am just delus and stuff.
[00:12:26.145 --> 00:12:26.905]  Too much information.
[00:12:27.206 --> 00:12:32.387]  And in fact, the clip we're looking for, Buckley, is at the first of the ¾-inch tape that says Delta Force.
[00:12:33.027 --> 00:12:36.828]  I have some video images of the statesman article.
[00:12:37.468 --> 00:12:39.509]  It's queued up and we're ready to go.
[00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:40.729]  Yeah, don't play the audio.
[00:12:40.749 --> 00:12:41.869]  Just play the video in front of me.
[00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:42.329]  Okay.
[00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:43.630]  And I'm not close to the monitor.
[00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:45.450]  You can look carefully and see what data it says.
[00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.570]  If you can, that'd be of great help.
[00:12:47.671 --> 00:12:48.031]  Okay, here we go.
[00:12:48.071 --> 00:12:48.651]  Go ahead and play it.
[00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:52.511]  March 29, 1998.
[00:12:53.251 --> 00:13:04.678]  Okay, that's good.
[00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:13.144]  And it talks about how wonderful it is, and there's many other articles about how wonderful the secret CIA bases are.
[00:13:14.125 --> 00:13:14.685]  Are you still there?
[00:13:15.365 --> 00:13:15.505]  Yes.
[00:13:15.525 --> 00:13:17.367]  Do you have any comments or anything?
[00:13:17.387 --> 00:13:17.847]  Any questions?
[00:13:18.863 --> 00:13:21.044]  Uh, I do, but I'm late.
[00:13:21.405 --> 00:13:22.545]  I don't want to talk right now.
[00:13:23.106 --> 00:13:23.806]  Okay, I understand.
[00:13:23.846 --> 00:13:24.767]  Hey, you're a really good artist.
[00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:25.407]  Thanks.
[00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:26.308]  That's a lot.
[00:13:26.448 --> 00:13:26.628]  Bye.
[00:13:27.708 --> 00:13:30.850]  Send me some more pictures and I'll actually show them on TV.
[00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:31.671]  Like it's a big deal.
[00:13:31.691 --> 00:13:32.391]  Like I'm a big deal.
[00:13:32.471 --> 00:13:33.392]  Like we're all big deals.
[00:13:33.412 --> 00:13:37.814]  We're just a bunch of people fighting, fighting, dealing, doing what we can.
[00:13:37.834 --> 00:13:44.358]  I wish you would do something out there.
[00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:45.719]  We're doing something.
[00:13:46.898 --> 00:13:50.580]  Dammit, we don't have the holy grail of information, but we know some of what's happening.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.661]  Now look, I want to get people to disagree.
[00:13:53.601 --> 00:13:54.302]  Do you disagree?
[00:13:54.562 --> 00:13:57.123]  I sure disagree with your bullshit propaganda, Alex.
[00:13:57.143 --> 00:13:58.124]  Why don't you debate me?
[00:13:58.624 --> 00:14:00.365]  Why don't you quit death-threatening people, buddy?
[00:14:00.845 --> 00:14:01.485]  Hello, you're on the air.
[00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:03.926]  You're on the air.
[00:14:04.126 --> 00:14:04.427]  Hello?
[00:14:04.847 --> 00:14:05.127]  Yes.
[00:14:06.528 --> 00:14:10.530]  Have you heard anything about the ranchers in West Texas?
[00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:15.352]  They're bringing suit against the government for flying their jets out there with
[00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:21.471]  Well, we're training Russian and German troops in some of our aircraft.
[00:14:22.072 --> 00:14:24.435]  The Germans are at Alamogordo in New Mexico.
[00:14:26.258 --> 00:14:30.805]  There's a lot of stuff going on, but troop training's not such a big deal.
[00:14:31.713 --> 00:14:35.895]  Did you see two weeks ago when I played a clip off C-SPAN at the U.N.?
[00:14:36.155 --> 00:14:36.315]  Yeah.
[00:14:36.335 --> 00:14:37.496]  Was Clinton saying U.N.
[00:14:37.516 --> 00:14:38.877]  troops or U.N.
[00:14:38.917 --> 00:14:40.678]  forces are coming to help us in the drug war?
[00:14:40.698 --> 00:14:41.298]  Mm-hmm.
[00:14:41.538 --> 00:14:42.058]  Yes, I did.
[00:14:42.098 --> 00:14:42.999]  So we're going to have U.N.
[00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:50.663]  Now we're not just going to have the CIA and the DEA and the FBI and the BATF and all the rest and local law enforcement.
[00:14:50.863 --> 00:14:51.903]  We're going to have U.N.
[00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:52.864]  law enforcement.
[00:14:53.324 --> 00:14:58.487]  Well, they were saying that they were, the ranchers were saying in regard to that
[00:14:59.505 --> 00:15:06.731]  During peacetime, they weren't supposed to fly over because they were fracturing their water tanks and everything, but the government said they could do what they wanted to.
[00:15:08.572 --> 00:15:10.133]  Well, that's basically what it is, isn't it?
[00:15:10.473 --> 00:15:11.234]  That's the truth.
[00:15:11.714 --> 00:15:18.059]  If people don't wake up to see what little things are going on here and there and putting things together themselves, they've got to be a robot.
[00:15:18.139 --> 00:15:19.660]  I appreciate your call.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.061]  Thank you.
[00:15:20.981 --> 00:15:26.886]  Well, we can't get any disagreements unless it's from someone that likes to call up and threaten producers.
[00:15:27.426 --> 00:15:28.087]  Hello, you're on the air.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.581]  Yeah, uh, tomorrow is, uh, NBA walkout.
[00:15:32.601 --> 00:15:34.722]  Would that be a conspiracy from our government?
[00:15:35.062 --> 00:15:38.483]  Everything is a conspiracy, and I am willing to argue with you.
[00:15:39.263 --> 00:15:40.524]  Turn the music down for a second.
[00:15:41.244 --> 00:15:42.224]  Turn the music down?
[00:15:42.704 --> 00:15:45.745]  Uh, well, they must be listening to music in the control room.
[00:15:45.765 --> 00:15:46.686]  You don't hear that music?
[00:15:47.786 --> 00:15:48.066]  No.
[00:15:48.846 --> 00:15:50.087]  You guys weren't playing it on the air?
[00:15:50.127 --> 00:15:53.608]  Yeah, it's just in the background, but go ahead and continue with the walkout.
