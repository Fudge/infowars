[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:07.330]  You're telling me people, and I'm going to get him honest as I can, that people were defecating on the floor and urinating on the floor?
[00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.711]  That's right.
[00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.231]  You're serious?
[00:00:08.251 --> 00:00:08.311]  No.
[00:00:08.331 --> 00:00:10.271]  He said people are defecating on the ground?
[00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:11.151]  No, he'll tell you.
[00:00:11.451 --> 00:00:12.992]  He'll tell you.
[00:00:13.352 --> 00:00:14.692]  It even gets worse than that.
[00:00:15.112 --> 00:00:18.993]  And you're telling me he told you on the telephone that people were defecating on the floor?
[00:00:19.013 --> 00:00:19.493]  Right.
[00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:22.814]  No, it's exactly, he told me in person.
[00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:24.934]  He told me about it after he got out.
[00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:29.048]  One of the, like the drunk tank, does not have a restroom.
[00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:30.769]  It doesn't have a urinal or whatever.
[00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.510]  They just, and they come in and hose it out.
[00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.031]  Well, that was the funny part.
[00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:38.053]  Whenever I was in the Austin... This is Cedar Park now.
[00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:39.474]  Yeah, well, I understand.
[00:00:39.634 --> 00:00:43.756]  But when I was in the Austin jail, they're all pretty professional except for this one short redhead guy.
[00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:45.717]  And I was just put in there.
[00:00:46.558 --> 00:00:49.520]  And after about three hours, right before I got out, I didn't know when I was getting out.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.220]  They didn't tell me.
[00:00:51.141 --> 00:00:53.122]  I came in, I knocked, and I was like, great.
[00:00:53.202 --> 00:00:54.062]  And I said, now use the restroom.
[00:00:54.082 --> 00:00:55.323]  And he said, get away from that door.
[00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:57.709]  So I went and sat down.
[00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:58.330]  It was no big deal.
[00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.531]  Held it for another 30 minutes and then got out.
[00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:01.791]  But that's the point.
[00:01:01.851 --> 00:01:02.752]  This is in Austin.
[00:01:03.272 --> 00:01:04.773]  That place was nasty, I'm telling you.
[00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:12.936]  Which is, you know, which I guess is okay, but to have for two and a half days in a room full of feces.
[00:01:13.336 --> 00:01:15.437]  We're also going to talk about Keith Campbell.
[00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:36.416]  A man that left the Austin Police Department on good terms with a good record because he felt they were breaking the law and felt that there was corruption and discrimination and other things.
[00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.938]  He has given up his driver's license and other things.
[00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:46.162]  He's been going to court over this and over traffic tickets and things that he's disputed.
[00:01:46.182 --> 00:01:53.907]  And he was put in jail with no BAPR facilities for two days and was only fed how many times, Mike?
[00:01:54.574 --> 00:01:58.557]  The first day he was in, they had one TV dinner in the evening.
[00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:07.543]  The next day, they had lunch and dinner, but this Cedar Park Jail, from what I understand, is not even an accredited jail.
[00:02:07.743 --> 00:02:09.104]  It's only a holding facility.
[00:02:09.444 --> 00:02:09.784]  How you doing?
[00:02:09.804 --> 00:02:10.465]  I appreciate you being here.
[00:02:10.605 --> 00:02:12.386]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:17.149]  Yeah, Keith's a friend of mine, and it's amazing.
[00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.251]  This whole thing, he's been fighting them
[00:02:20.027 --> 00:02:23.688]  This all started out with some tickets in Lago Vista and he won one court.
[00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:24.608]  In fact, I witnessed.
[00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.750]  He called for a jury trial and won with four prosecutors.
[00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.531]  The judge was denying motions.
[00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:40.233]  These prosecutors were passing each other notes and he was actually found not guilty on one charge.
[00:02:40.813 --> 00:02:44.294]  He had another court date and I don't know all the little points of law, but he
[00:02:45.382 --> 00:02:52.245]  This guy's going by the law, using, you know, people, they, uh, they encourage everybody to, uh, use the system.
[00:02:52.445 --> 00:02:53.566]  And that's what Keith's doing.
[00:02:54.326 --> 00:02:56.567]  And what makes him mad is he's not using attorneys.
[00:02:56.607 --> 00:02:57.908]  He's, he's being his own attorney.
[00:02:58.808 --> 00:03:05.372]  And, uh, he had some point of law and the judge denied it in order to immediate, uh, warrant for his arrest.
[00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:08.153]  And Keith turned himself in that morning and it, uh,
[00:03:09.428 --> 00:03:14.792]  It was almost, I think this was a Wednesday morning and it almost, they almost kept them all weekend.
[00:03:15.173 --> 00:03:16.473]  There was a bunch of his friends.
[00:03:16.674 --> 00:03:20.276]  So it was more than, when you called me he was unable to get into my radio show.
[00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:22.138]  How many days was he held?
[00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:23.759]  He was held two and a half days.
[00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.779]  And was fed one meal?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.922]  Well he was fed one meal a day and then the second day they fed him two.
[00:03:29.103 --> 00:03:30.263]  Now that's not what concerns me.
[00:03:30.283 --> 00:03:35.007]  What concerns me is when I went to jail for disorderly conduct on a thumb scanning
[00:03:37.203 --> 00:03:39.404]  I was held in a holding cell with no urinal.
[00:03:41.945 --> 00:03:46.726]  In Cedar Park Jail, they don't even have facilities.
[00:03:46.946 --> 00:03:48.067]  There's a biohazard.
[00:03:48.307 --> 00:03:49.607]  Don't tell anybody out there, folks.
[00:03:49.627 --> 00:03:52.208]  There's a biohazard in Cedar Park Jail right now.
[00:03:52.308 --> 00:03:53.388]  It should be investigated.
[00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:55.569]  Well, this is the thing that I noticed.
[00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:57.270]  The DPS was very professional.
[00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.471]  Once Mike Cox, their public information person, pretty much gave the order for me to go to jail.
[00:04:05.254 --> 00:04:07.215]  Who were out there protesting, and I was taken to jail.
[00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:09.517]  And I wanted to be taken to jail.
[00:04:09.557 --> 00:04:14.220]  I wasn't violent, I didn't use profanity, but I did stand up and preach at them for about 20 minutes, and they took me to jail.
[00:04:15.161 --> 00:04:16.302]  Most of you have seen the footage of this.
[00:04:18.343 --> 00:04:29.491]  But the scary part about it is, is once I got there, most, the person at the fingerprint of me was nice, and Mr. Ard was nice, but when I asked to use the restroom after
[00:04:30.492 --> 00:04:31.952]  I don't want to sound like a whining baby here.
[00:04:32.412 --> 00:04:36.673]  After three and a half hours, and I've been out all day, by the way, I hadn't used, you know, a bathroom since that morning.
[00:04:37.573 --> 00:04:38.393]  I needed to urinate.
[00:04:39.954 --> 00:04:44.975]  I was told to get away from the door, because the holding tank I was being held in had a grate on the door.
[00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:48.475]  It had a television with plexiglass in front of it, which I wasn't watching.
[00:04:49.995 --> 00:04:51.696]  Three telephones, which is fine.
[00:04:53.316 --> 00:04:58.057]  And no bathroom with loogies and urine in the corner.
[00:04:58.517 --> 00:04:59.217]  It was very gross.
[00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.098]  Uh, now you're telling me, and I know Keith Campbell, he's a very stoic, has a beautiful wife, young children, he's been on my radio show.
[00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:14.243]  Law-abiding citizen, and all this guy was doing was using their system.
[00:05:14.303 --> 00:05:21.751]  Now you're telling me people, and I'm gonna get as honest as I can, that people were defecating on the floor and urinating on the floor?
[00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:22.152]  That's right.
[00:05:22.532 --> 00:05:23.153]  Cedar Park Jail.
[00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.539]  That's right.
[00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:28.401]  So in the Cedar Park Jail, people are... And it's not... He should have been taken to county.
[00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:35.085]  This is... I mean, and I've got this from a law enforcement officer, and I won't say what county, but he knows Cedar Park Jail well.
[00:05:35.465 --> 00:05:47.212]  And the other thing is, the Lago Vista police were real nice, and they were talking to him to and from, and were basically telling him that this was out of their hands, that they didn't appreciate how this was going either.
[00:05:47.859 --> 00:05:50.441]  But he's got the judge and some... Now wait a minute.
[00:05:50.461 --> 00:05:50.881]  Wait a minute.
[00:05:50.941 --> 00:05:54.604]  If it's out of their hands and they don't appreciate it... Well, they're following orders.
[00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:56.205]  Well, we need police to picket.
[00:05:56.385 --> 00:05:58.106]  We need people to put their jobs on the line.
[00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:01.148]  See, that's what Keith did.
[00:06:01.168 --> 00:06:02.289]  I'm sick of these cowards.
[00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.091]  I'm sick of people that say, oh, this is wrong.
[00:06:06.552 --> 00:06:07.632]  I mean, I've seen Keith.
[00:06:07.652 --> 00:06:08.253]  He's a Christian.
[00:06:08.593 --> 00:06:09.854]  And he's not one of these Bible-thumpers.
[00:06:09.874 --> 00:06:10.794]  He doesn't even talk about it.
[00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:13.779]  He's a handsome man.
[00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:14.800]  He's an intelligent man.
[00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.581]  I've met with him probably ten times.
[00:06:17.641 --> 00:06:18.241]  I know him well.
[00:06:20.762 --> 00:06:22.782]  He has a beautiful life and nice kids.
[00:06:23.342 --> 00:06:24.163]  And here's this guy.
[00:06:25.043 --> 00:06:26.824]  Leaves the police department because of corruption.
[00:06:28.064 --> 00:06:29.184]  Leaves on good record.
[00:06:29.204 --> 00:06:29.825]  He just left.
[00:06:31.485 --> 00:06:33.806]  Gets rid of his social security number and his driver's license.
[00:06:36.227 --> 00:06:37.027]  Fights it in court.
[00:06:38.368 --> 00:06:39.809]  And it's sent for two and a half days?
[00:06:40.209 --> 00:06:41.210]  Now, you're serious.
[00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.171]  He said people are defecating on the ground.
[00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:44.032]  No, he'll tell you.
[00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:45.853]  He'll tell you.
[00:06:46.454 --> 00:06:47.574]  It even gets worse than that.
[00:06:47.715 --> 00:06:53.599]  There's some kind of an old deactivated shower that all the inmates spit.
[00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:54.980]  I mean, it's terrible.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.822]  It's a wonder people aren't coming out of there with TB.
[00:06:58.262 --> 00:06:59.323]  Well, with cholera.
[00:06:59.583 --> 00:06:59.803]  Right.
[00:07:00.222 --> 00:07:00.822]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.883]  Back to this... What about if you refresh our memories and tell us where exactly he started all of this?
[00:07:30.003 --> 00:07:31.724]  How he got involved in it and how he got arrested?
[00:07:31.744 --> 00:07:33.565]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:07:33.605 --> 00:07:36.066]  Well, he'd had... I don't know exactly.
[00:07:36.126 --> 00:07:46.051]  I mean, he'd had some tickets out there and instead of paying them, and this is another thing, he even had the attorney, the prosecutor out there calling him at home saying, just pay it.
[00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:49.849]  Uh, you know, we don't want, we don't want people to start fighting this.
[00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:51.530]  This, it's a domino effect.
[00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:53.311]  The prosecutor told him it's a domino effect.
[00:07:53.531 --> 00:07:55.913]  For traffic.
[00:07:55.933 --> 00:07:59.014]  They want people just to lay down and pay.
[00:07:59.114 --> 00:08:02.116]  And he was also getting, having no driver's license tickets, correct?
[00:08:03.157 --> 00:08:04.558]  I think he still has a license.
[00:08:04.598 --> 00:08:08.620]  He had, it was a no inspection and no license, something like that.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.503]  And it all, the one he beat was a run on the stop sign, which he did not run the stop sign.
[00:08:14.179 --> 00:08:16.200]  And he had his whole family in the car.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.801]  I mean, it's a minor traffic... Well, here's the point.
[00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:21.982]  Basically, was he guilty of it or not?
[00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:22.882]  No, no.
[00:08:22.942 --> 00:08:24.923]  And here's the point that we have to make here.
[00:08:25.603 --> 00:08:33.346]  And that is that the point is, is what we're hearing is true.
[00:08:33.366 --> 00:08:34.087]  I'm sure it is.
[00:08:34.367 --> 00:08:35.167]  You heard this from Keith.
[00:08:35.507 --> 00:08:38.068]  Oh, I was in contact with him.
[00:08:38.128 --> 00:08:39.329]  His wife helped.
[00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:42.810]  I didn't, I wasn't the one that put up the bail, but I helped, I helped get him out of jail.
[00:08:45.249 --> 00:08:58.281]  I mean, think about this folks, and it's been going on a long time, even people that fail to appear on traffic, there's people sitting in jail on traffic stuff with murderers, rapists,
[00:08:58.863 --> 00:08:59.363]  Burglars?
[00:08:59.624 --> 00:09:00.944]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:09:01.004 --> 00:09:04.847]  Maybe they ought to do a deal on traffic where... Well, they're talking about this domino effect.
[00:09:05.447 --> 00:09:07.108]  The system... They don't want you fighting.
[00:09:07.128 --> 00:09:11.831]  The system engages in traffic tickets and things, which some of them are good, by the way.
[00:09:11.911 --> 00:09:12.151]  Sure.
[00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:15.613]  But they engage those revenue generations for money.
[00:09:15.873 --> 00:09:17.094]  And if you fight it, it's bad.
[00:09:17.154 --> 00:09:23.918]  And I heard on the news, I don't know if it's true, because it came from the news, but that in New York, something like... I don't want to be wrong here.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:26.660]  Something like...
[00:09:27.743 --> 00:09:31.905]  30-something percent of people contest their tickets and like 80% win or something?
[00:09:32.666 --> 00:09:33.566]  That's just from memory.
[00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:37.248]  What really makes them mad is when you represent yourself, because that cuts out the attorneys.
[00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:41.630]  And then also, you know, they have certain little protocol in court.
[00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:46.472]  And I witnessed this deal where every motion he made, the judge denied.
[00:09:46.913 --> 00:09:54.136]  Every time the prosecutor objected to Keith's questioning of a witness, he was overruled and he beat four legal eagles.
[00:09:54.296 --> 00:09:55.577]  And it was amazing.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:58.861]  And he was innocent on that run-of-the-stop sign deal.
[00:10:00.102 --> 00:10:06.765]  The traffic stuff's minor, but what, you know, putting people in non-up-to-standard jails, things like that.
[00:10:06.785 --> 00:10:07.865]  Now wait a minute, I know Keith.
[00:10:09.326 --> 00:10:12.587]  I mean, I got him on my radio show to talk about police corruption here in town.
[00:10:13.328 --> 00:10:18.870]  We knew law enforcement was coming forward about drug dealing and things, but he wouldn't, he really wouldn't say anything that he hadn't proven.
[00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:21.431]  He just got on it with pretty, actually pretty bland.
[00:10:22.212 --> 00:10:23.772]  This guy's pretty bland, to tell you the truth.
[00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:25.213]  He just goes according to what he thinks is right.
[00:10:26.317 --> 00:10:30.220]  And you're telling me he told you on the telephone that people were defecating on the floor?
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:30.681]  Right.
[00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:34.003]  No, it's... It's exactly... He told me in person.
[00:10:34.223 --> 00:10:36.145]  He told me about it after he got out.
[00:10:37.826 --> 00:10:40.248]  One of the... Like, the drunk tank does not have a restroom.
[00:10:40.308 --> 00:10:41.970]  It doesn't have a urinal or whatever.
[00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:43.711]  They just... And they come in and hose it out.
[00:10:44.191 --> 00:10:45.232]  Well, that was the funny part.
[00:10:46.753 --> 00:10:49.275]  Whenever I was in the Austin... This is Cedar Park now.
[00:10:49.335 --> 00:10:50.677]  Yeah, well, I understand.
[00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:54.900]  But when I was in the Austin jail, they're all pretty professional except for this one short redhead guy.
[00:10:55.976 --> 00:11:06.503]  And I was just put in there, and after about three hours, right before I got out, I didn't know when I was getting out, they didn't tell me, I came in, I knocked, and I was like, great, and I said, Matt, he's in the restroom, and he said, get away from that door.
[00:11:06.543 --> 00:11:11.727]  So I went and sat down, it was no big deal, held it for another 30 minutes, and then got out.
[00:11:12.187 --> 00:11:23.875]  But that's the point, this is in Austin, that place was nasty, I'm telling you, which is, you know, which I guess is okay, but to have, for two and a half days, in a room full of feces,
[00:11:25.638 --> 00:11:28.080]  You know, it's like Gordon Liddy talks about these prison guards.
[00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:33.024]  You know, the average, average burglar or armed robber goes for a couple of years.
[00:11:33.384 --> 00:11:36.166]  These guards go for their, they work there their whole life.
[00:11:36.767 --> 00:11:38.348]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:11:38.808 --> 00:11:40.450]  That's a whole, that's a whole nother deal.
[00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.912]  Somebody wanting to be a, wanting to be a guard or.
[00:11:43.652 --> 00:11:44.173]  It's kind of a power.
[00:11:44.193 --> 00:11:44.813]  Working in jail.
[00:11:44.853 --> 00:11:47.795]  I guess they got to work in the jail before they can go out on patrol or something.
[00:11:47.815 --> 00:11:49.777]  Well, it's kind of a power trip for a lot of them, I imagine.
[00:11:49.817 --> 00:11:50.017]  Yeah.
[00:11:50.478 --> 00:11:52.879]  Anyway, I mean, it's, it's disgusting what happened.
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.721]  I mean, the traffic stuff's minor.
[00:11:55.606 --> 00:12:01.772]  I'm going to try to keep the jail standards and you can get it from the horse's mouth.
[00:12:02.232 --> 00:12:03.293]  I've not been this excited ever!
[00:12:03.313 --> 00:12:03.834]  Yeah, Mug Club, baby!
[00:12:03.854 --> 00:12:03.934]  Wow!

[00:12:36.691 --> 00:12:42.215]  I want to thank you all for making The Great Reset and The War for the World a number one national bestseller.
[00:12:42.515 --> 00:12:43.837]  It's had a huge effect.
[00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.211]  We've topped it.
[00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:47.577]  This new book has just come out.
[00:12:47.958 --> 00:12:51.025]  It's available at InfoWareStore.com, signed or unsigned.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:52.901]  It is incredible.
[00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:57.603]  It goes through the entire globalist master plan, their activities, what makes them tick.
[00:12:58.364 --> 00:13:01.065]  And then we lay out an alternate plan for humanity.
[00:13:01.566 --> 00:13:04.867]  And unlike the globalists, we're not ordering people to follow our plan.
[00:13:05.168 --> 00:13:08.590]  We're simply giving alternatives to the dystopia they're building.
[00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:15.634]  That's why it's the Great Awakening, defeating the globalists and launching the next great renaissance.
[00:13:16.374 --> 00:13:28.924]  What they're selling, owning nothing, having nothing, eating bugs, castrating our children, cutting our daughters' breasts off, World War III with Russia, human smuggling, open borders, drag queen pedophile time.
[00:13:29.344 --> 00:13:36.430]  What they're selling is so unpopular, we've got to oppose what they're doing, but also give an alternate plan.
[00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:39.292]  And that's what this book opens the debate about.
[00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.794]  It is powerful, it is riveting, it is informative.
[00:13:43.595 --> 00:13:43.795]  I think?
[00:13:58.592 --> 00:13:59.052]  We're good to go.
