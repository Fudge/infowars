[00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:01.490]  A really good idea.
[00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.692]  And thanks to Inventech, no one's gonna cash in but me.
[00:00:05.053 --> 00:00:08.815]  They're going to help me get my invention off the drawing board and into the marketplace.
[00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:10.576]  I really need Inventech.
[00:00:10.857 --> 00:00:11.837]  What's that number again?
[00:00:11.857 --> 00:00:11.917]  1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:12.438 --> 00:00:12.838]  One more time?
[00:00:12.858 --> 00:00:13.138]  Call 1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:13.559]  That's 1-800-313-6868.
[00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:39.755]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:40.655]  Big Brother.
[00:00:41.296 --> 00:00:42.376]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:44.197]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:44.217 --> 00:00:45.638]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.398 --> 00:00:47.179]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:51.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:56.252]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:01:08.575 --> 00:01:17.317]  Well, early this morning, my wife woke me up and said, get up, they've shut down part of downtown Austin.
[00:01:19.582 --> 00:01:24.126]  There are dead birds all over the place, and some police had to go to the hospital.
[00:01:25.987 --> 00:01:32.632]  And sure enough, at least three police officers said they felt ill when they were responding to the report.
[00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:40.218]  The Capitol Police first discovered a bunch of dead pigeons out front the Capitol, and then all the way up Congress.
[00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:46.884]  Congress was supposedly littered with several dozen of the dead flying rats.
[00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:51.079]  I better watch it.
[00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:53.080]  Kevin races pigeons and he loves them.
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.161]  We've actually had pigeons delivered here before and they were in the big box with the holes in it.
[00:01:59.121 --> 00:01:59.281]  Uh-oh!
[00:02:00.222 --> 00:02:01.422]  We're in trouble now!
[00:02:02.782 --> 00:02:05.643]  Jack Bauer will be kicking down the door to keep us safe.
[00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:17.086]  But to make a long story short, it's probably one of the apartment owners or business owners downtown sick of the
[00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:20.995]  Flying rats who poisoned a bunch of them, which people do.
[00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:34.608]  They put little electrical zappers all over the store signs, all over the buildings downtown, on all the ledges, or many of the ledges, in an attempt to frustrate the pigeon infestations.
[00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.334]  But I would have to say that someone poisoned the pigeons.
[00:02:41.943 --> 00:02:47.166]  Or there was some big vat of water on a rooftop they've been drinking out of and somebody poisoned the pigeons.
[00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:53.169]  Or a chemical leached on a building on a rooftop into a big vat of water and killed the pigeons.
[00:02:53.989 --> 00:03:01.893]  Something like that, but I really wasn't even going to cover it today until I noticed that Drudge was reporting on it and there was national news reports.
[00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:04.935]  Had Al-Qaeda struck?
[00:03:06.816 --> 00:03:08.957]  Hmm, was it all over for us?
[00:03:11.016 --> 00:03:19.683]  So we'll be going over just the hysteria in society.
[00:03:21.124 --> 00:03:27.049]  Meanwhile, Michael Chertoff is saying he's worried about homegrown terrorists killing us any minute.
[00:03:27.089 --> 00:03:28.690]  We'll be going over that report.
[00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:33.453]  They're talking about a curfew in the Big Easy after eight slayings in less than a week.
[00:03:36.416 --> 00:03:38.718]  And miscommunication is cited in Port Alert.
[00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:39.058]  Remember,
[00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:41.637]  In Miami they were all freaking out.
[00:03:43.599 --> 00:04:02.633]  Yesterday evening they had caught Muslims in containers and it was people sneaking into the facility and then it turns out it was just some port guard flipping out on a truck driving in that had some Muslims in it.
[00:04:03.894 --> 00:04:06.996]  Not even Muslims, it was just that one was an Iraqi and
[00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:09.726]  Tour from somewhere else in the Middle East.
[00:04:11.926 --> 00:04:13.987]  Put the southern borders wide open.
[00:04:14.787 --> 00:04:19.489]  It's just any way to create total hysteria and fear.
[00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:32.473]  So we'll dovetail that with New York gas smell, shuts down trains, forces evacuations, shuts down schools in much of Manhattan because someone's smelling gas.
[00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:37.234]  And of course they think it's gas, it must be Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:37.334 --> 00:04:42.555]  Not a gas main link that happens all the time in every major city and even small towns.
[00:04:43.375 --> 00:04:46.776]  No, if you smell natural gas it must be an Al-Qaeda strike.
[00:04:47.376 --> 00:04:52.418]  But the government said we're checking into it and a few hours later said don't worry, it's not Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:54.278 --> 00:04:57.919]  I mean, just a nation of people that jump at their shadows.
[00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.632]  Now, now, I would be worried about a gas explosion.
[00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:04.893]  I mean, gas is serious.
[00:05:07.695 --> 00:05:11.959]  One time I had an office right next to a big gas distribution facility.
[00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:15.621]  One day I really smelled it and I called them and said, everything all right over there?
[00:05:15.642 --> 00:05:19.304]  Yeah, we had a leak when we were filling up a truck, but it's okay now.
[00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:24.588]  And I was like, well, I keep smelling it another hour from now, I'm gonna call the fire department.
[00:05:25.209 --> 00:05:26.290]  But they got it under control.
[00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.610]  All right.
[00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.811]  Big show today.
[00:05:28.831 --> 00:05:30.152]  A lot of news to cover.
[00:05:30.712 --> 00:05:31.512]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:31.532 --> 00:05:31.993]  Stay with me.
[00:05:36.175 --> 00:05:39.737]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:40.297]  are located?
[00:05:40.497 --> 00:05:43.899]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:48.821]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:05:49.101 --> 00:05:54.104]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.

[00:06:38.636 --> 00:06:41.818]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:06:42.138 --> 00:06:44.100]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:52.105]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:52.785 --> 00:06:59.849]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:11.655]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:07:11.975 --> 00:07:15.477]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:07:15.938 --> 00:07:17.879]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:07:18.199 --> 00:07:22.041]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:35.431 --> 00:07:37.833]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:07:37.913 --> 00:07:40.375]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:07:40.455 --> 00:07:45.139]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:45.814 --> 00:07:52.619]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:07:53.159 --> 00:08:06.048]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:08:06.508 --> 00:08:07.329]  Wristease is perfect
[00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:07.809]  We're good to go.
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.204]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:40.585 --> 00:08:42.887]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:57.839 --> 00:08:59.401]  Everyone I know.
[00:09:00.261 --> 00:09:00.722]  Everyone.
[00:09:02.393 --> 00:09:14.621]  Every person in my office, one, two, three, four, five, a sixth person is out today, Jeremy, everyone is sick with allergies.
[00:09:15.662 --> 00:09:30.192]  And I mean allergies so bad they will give you fevers, they will give you ear aches, they will, and I talked to my grandmother who grew up here in Austin, my mother grew up here in Austin, none of them had allergies, no one they knew had allergies,
[00:09:31.309 --> 00:09:35.312]  And I was thinking, well, you know, maybe they just didn't know what to call it then.
[00:09:35.332 --> 00:09:37.254]  And I said, did people get headaches all the time?
[00:09:37.694 --> 00:09:39.475]  Did they have runny noses all the time?
[00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.357]  When the Cedar got going, did everybody get sick?
[00:09:42.397 --> 00:09:43.078]  And they said, no.
[00:09:43.178 --> 00:09:44.079]  Very few people.
[00:09:44.539 --> 00:09:45.380]  It was very rare.
[00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:52.205]  Now, everyone, I'm seriously, everyone is sick in the city of Austin.
[00:09:54.206 --> 00:09:58.730]  We are the supposed capital of allergies.
[00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:04.788]  I mean, I'm somebody who, growing up, might have gotten sick maybe once a year.
[00:10:04.888 --> 00:10:07.891]  Sometimes I might go a year and a half without getting sick.
[00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:13.755]  And I remember I had a neighbor who we'd ride dirt bikes together when we were like 12 years old.
[00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:17.738]  And mopeds and stuff, just insane that we were allowed to go out and do that.
[00:10:18.979 --> 00:10:21.701]  And I'd go over and bang, bang, bang, and I'd be like, come out!
[00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:22.521]  Come on, let's go!
[00:10:22.862 --> 00:10:23.582]  Let's go play!
[00:10:24.543 --> 00:10:26.564]  And no, no, I've got allergies!
[00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:28.506]  And he'd be sneezing, eyes running.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.760]  You know, nose running.
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.781]  Come outside!
[00:10:31.801 --> 00:10:33.101]  No, I can't come outside.
[00:10:33.161 --> 00:10:34.241]  I'd go, you're a wimp!
[00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:41.743]  Because, you know, I was convinced that allergies was something that wimps had, and that it didn't exist.
[00:10:44.144 --> 00:10:47.264]  And then I moved to Austin when I was, I don't know, 17?
[00:10:48.705 --> 00:10:51.645]  And a couple years later, I was like, man, I've been sick for like a week.
[00:10:51.685 --> 00:10:52.206]  What is this?
[00:10:52.926 --> 00:10:54.686]  Every time I go outside, it gets worse.
[00:10:54.846 --> 00:10:55.626]  Cedar fever.
[00:10:56.467 --> 00:10:57.627]  But the question is,
[00:10:58.684 --> 00:11:01.806]  Why is... I mean, even my children get sick from it.
[00:11:03.347 --> 00:11:10.612]  Why is it, and I'm born here, why is it that people in the past didn't have allergies but now they do?
[00:11:11.312 --> 00:11:18.237]  It's a very important question that everybody needs to be asking.
[00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:21.739]  And I'm just throwing it out there today because it's a mystery to me.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.482]  I mean, this is going on a week that I've been sick from this.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:38.152]  And then by last Thursday you heard me, it was like Toad Man Radio, because I guess it had caused an infection and I'd actually gotten a fever and an earache and a sore throat and I could barely talk.
[00:11:39.954 --> 00:11:47.642]  And I still feel like, I went to Houston this weekend for a day and a half and by the second day in Houston felt fine.
[00:11:48.826 --> 00:11:53.410]  Got the window down, driving back into Austin, kind of forgotten about it all of a sudden.
[00:11:53.650 --> 00:12:03.818]  I mean, it's like I'd like to be the bubble boy or something a few months out of the year when this stuff's going crazy here in Austin.
[00:12:05.259 --> 00:12:07.381]  I tell you, it's enough to make me move out of this town.
[00:12:07.401 --> 00:12:10.223]  It's enough to make me leave this town.
[00:12:10.623 --> 00:12:12.285]  But I'm told it's bad in other parts of the country.
[00:12:12.685 --> 00:12:14.927]  Why is everybody getting allergies?
[00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:17.810]  From Minneapolis-St.
[00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:24.314]  Paul, to Chicago, to Austin, to New York, to San Francisco, to LA, to Kansas City.
[00:12:25.455 --> 00:12:31.819]  All over the country allergy problems are getting worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.022]  Something is connected to this.
[00:12:35.262 --> 00:12:45.349]  I don't think it's... Well they've got all these different scientific reports that genetically modified crops have now gotten into other plants and that once you've been eating genetically modified crops
[00:12:46.524 --> 00:12:55.170]  That it heightens autoimmune responses in your body, because your body has an allergic reaction to the food you're eating, and then that compounds with what's in the air.
[00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:57.371]  I tend to think that makes sense.
[00:12:58.992 --> 00:13:00.813]  You know, I say it's a mystery, it really isn't.
[00:13:01.774 --> 00:13:10.639]  There's all these hormones in our food, there's all these toxins in our water, and your body's fighting all that with its autoimmune system.
[00:13:11.167 --> 00:13:19.209]  And so if you've got a good autoimmune system, I guess it gets jacked up real high, and then it's fighting with everything that comes into your body.
[00:13:22.289 --> 00:13:24.950]  So I think I've just answered the question there.
[00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:29.671]  Of course, it's a cocktail of reasons, but I don't enjoy this.
[00:13:31.551 --> 00:13:33.872]  I don't feel like... I mean, yesterday,
[00:13:35.783 --> 00:13:38.384]  I went in and did the Sunday show I do from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:13:38.824 --> 00:13:49.068]  out of the News Radio 590 KLBJ studios, and I shouldn't even have been doing a show because what it does is when I've got an allergy and I'm tired already, I just get mad.
[00:13:50.829 --> 00:14:01.933]  I don't even want to engage in the brain power it takes to analyze and lay something out, so I just started screaming at the New World Order and being sarcastic and acting like I was pro-world government.
[00:14:02.374 --> 00:14:03.154]  People loved it.
[00:14:04.386 --> 00:14:11.870]  We had, like, you know, the local public radio station calling up with people who work there going, yeah, we're fans, we want a tape of this, this is the best ever!
[00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.510]  The callers were all loving it.
[00:14:14.491 --> 00:14:21.054]  See, I mean, there's no judging the public's taste out there, but I kind of feel like that today.
[00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:29.638]  And I kind of feel like just talking about myself when I'm in low-grade moron mode.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.722]  And I guess I started losing some of my judgment, too.
[00:14:36.362 --> 00:14:42.605]  Because I was on my Myspace account this morning.
[00:14:42.625 --> 00:14:45.526]  It says people give us good news tips there.
[00:14:46.327 --> 00:14:46.927]  Sometimes.
[00:14:47.447 --> 00:14:49.968]  The email's a hundred times better, because there's a hundred times more.
[00:14:51.609 --> 00:14:55.711]  And there's this guy on there posting.
[00:14:56.974 --> 00:15:04.500]  I think he's the same guy I saw yesterday going, Alex Jones has an Order of Death flag in his office!
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.462]  Proof that he's Illuminati!
[00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:11.866]  No, it's not an Order of Death flag in my office.
[00:15:11.926 --> 00:15:13.407]  It says Liberty or Death.
[00:15:13.888 --> 00:15:17.971]  It's a Culpeper Minute Men Militia flag.
[00:15:18.852 --> 00:15:20.793]  And by the way, I didn't even hang it there.
[00:15:22.995 --> 00:15:26.418]  It was hanging out on the wall in the main office.
[00:15:27.398 --> 00:15:30.961]  And somebody stuck it up in there thinking it'd be a better backdrop.
[00:15:30.981 --> 00:15:36.125]  I ought to ask who did that, because I guess we should actually try to decorate this set.
[00:15:37.186 --> 00:15:40.088]  We videotape it, and we never really put any thought into how it looks.
[00:15:40.689 --> 00:15:41.870]  That's about how I operate.
[00:15:42.731 --> 00:15:44.292]  But I mean, that's the type of stuff I deal with.
[00:15:44.312 --> 00:15:54.300]  You know, I do not have an Illuminati flag hanging up on my wall, and anybody could see that it's a snake on the ground, and it says, liberty or death.
[00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:57.700]  That's the kind of stuff I have to put up with.
[00:15:59.141 --> 00:16:06.545]  And the reason that type of criticism gets me mad is not that you're criticizing me.
[00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:09.627]  I have weird psychology.
[00:16:10.047 --> 00:16:13.549]  It's that you are obsessing on things that do not matter.
[00:16:16.616 --> 00:16:22.238]  I mean, that's what most people do, is they spend their time ninnying and obsessing over minutiae.
[00:16:22.318 --> 00:16:23.679]  Is this person a good leader?
[00:16:24.119 --> 00:16:26.000]  Is that person legitimate?
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.361]  Who's your favorite person in the anti-New World Order movement?
[00:16:29.921 --> 00:16:31.162]  When it doesn't matter!
[00:16:32.162 --> 00:16:34.844]  They're not debating the fact that we've got a North American Union.
[00:16:35.124 --> 00:16:43.707]  They're not debating the fact that we're getting rid of our borders, and Mexican troops shoot at and overrun our police and military on a monthly basis, and are kidnapping U.S.
[00:16:43.747 --> 00:16:45.628]  citizens, and nothing's being done!
[00:16:46.596 --> 00:16:56.165]  And the fact that they're about to surge 20,000 to 40,000 more troops into Iraq, when the American people want the opposite.
[00:16:57.026 --> 00:16:58.727]  I mean, can't you deal with issues?
[00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:06.194]  Can't you get focused in on anything real?
[00:17:06.815 --> 00:17:10.298]  I mean, is it possible for you to do that?
[00:17:13.001 --> 00:17:18.105]  Instead of talking about what other people need to be doing.
[00:17:18.865 --> 00:17:21.067]  Well, I think Alex needs to do it like that.
[00:17:22.088 --> 00:17:35.978]  And I actually printed it off here, and now that I want it, I don't see it in my huge stacks, but the same guy, now that I'm just spontaneously talking about this, I'm trying to
[00:17:36.818 --> 00:17:37.759]  Find the printout of it.
[00:17:38.279 --> 00:17:45.623]  The same guy criticized me today and said, you know, I just noticed he gets real angry on the show.
[00:17:45.643 --> 00:17:49.626]  There could be a better way to get people to fight the New World Order.
[00:17:50.566 --> 00:17:53.468]  And he says things are really bad.
[00:17:53.488 --> 00:17:56.970]  It's just all dire this, dire that.
[00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.152]  It's a bunch of hype.
[00:18:00.399 --> 00:18:03.802]  You know, we're on to you, we're watching you.
[00:18:04.022 --> 00:18:07.125]  Well good, let's just say you're right, you're on to me now.
[00:18:07.805 --> 00:18:10.167]  Okay, can you now go get on to the New World Order?
[00:18:11.188 --> 00:18:13.270]  Can you now go wake somebody up about them?
[00:18:13.290 --> 00:18:22.037]  But no, no, no, it's the psychology of losers to pick at the people that are in the arena trying to do something.
[00:18:23.579 --> 00:18:25.200]  Of course I'm mad.
[00:18:26.481 --> 00:18:28.383]  That's why I'm motivated to do this.
[00:18:30.561 --> 00:18:32.582]  Alright, that's why I put in long hours.
[00:18:35.444 --> 00:18:36.665]  Of course I'm angry.
[00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:49.353]  And if you don't think things are dire, I mean just from a financial point of view, the money you have in the bank has been devalued by almost half.
[00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:52.195]  It's 49% today.
[00:18:53.055 --> 00:18:57.218]  It fluctuates back and forth between about 49 and 47 the last six months.
[00:18:58.098 --> 00:19:01.039]  The money you've got in the bank has been devalued.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:05.101]  And they're talking about devaluing it again by another half.
[00:19:05.701 --> 00:19:10.423]  Now, if that isn't sensational, baby, I don't know what is.
[00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:14.585]  I mean, that is hitting you directly in the pocketbook.
[00:19:15.766 --> 00:19:20.608]  And I'm not even somebody who's that big into money, but I know you need it to pay for things and to live and to operate.
[00:19:20.908 --> 00:19:23.369]  So it upsets me, yeah, I mean, it really does.
[00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.231]  But what upsets me more is how the government scams us.
[00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:36.999]  They give you some little 6-7% tax cut and you feel good about it, but then they rob the value of your currency by 40 plus percent?
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.723]  I mean, that's a smoke and mirrors scam!
[00:19:42.064 --> 00:19:42.945]  It's a fraud!
[00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:44.206]  It makes me mad!
[00:19:44.487 --> 00:19:46.409]  It makes me want to punch people in the nose!
[00:19:50.879 --> 00:19:51.920]  And absolutely!
[00:19:53.241 --> 00:20:08.452]  I sit there when I'm reading an SPP.gov website, you know, government documents saying that they're going to merge and unify and standardize all of our bureaucracies, and we're going into the North American Union.
[00:20:08.532 --> 00:20:08.772]  I do.
[00:20:08.852 --> 00:20:11.935]  I sit there and I go, what is a headline that will get people's attention?
[00:20:12.515 --> 00:20:13.135]  Absolutely.
[00:20:13.175 --> 00:20:14.076]  Guilty as charged.
[00:20:15.417 --> 00:20:19.100]  I mean, I can't give you words to describe how bad this is.
[00:20:22.717 --> 00:20:27.905]  So, there's people out there, number one, that say it isn't as bad as I say it is.
[00:20:27.945 --> 00:20:28.286]  No, no, no.
[00:20:29.267 --> 00:20:30.229]  You're right, it's worse.
[00:20:31.431 --> 00:20:32.652]  And then they're mad that I'm angry?
[00:20:32.713 --> 00:20:33.854]  We need to get angry!
[00:20:34.415 --> 00:20:35.417]  Shake it off, folks!
[00:20:37.606 --> 00:20:38.627]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:41.728]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:20:42.008 --> 00:20:46.171]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:47.431]  So what do you do?
[00:20:47.751 --> 00:20:52.314]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:54.936]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:20:55.416 --> 00:20:56.317]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:20:56.718 --> 00:21:10.109]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:42.172]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:59.061]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[00:22:00.022 --> 00:22:05.206]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.

[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.722]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:22:41.223 --> 00:22:43.645]  Do you realize that the race for the cure is over?

[00:23:35.436 --> 00:23:37.518]  Gold is like nothing else on Earth.
[00:23:37.738 --> 00:23:43.842]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:23:44.022 --> 00:23:47.845]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:23:48.206 --> 00:23:50.107]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:23:50.147 --> 00:23:52.429]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:23:52.589 --> 00:23:59.354]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[00:23:59.674 --> 00:24:00.575]  We're good to go.
[00:24:23.696 --> 00:24:25.678]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:26.199 --> 00:24:30.323]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:24:30.464 --> 00:24:31.505]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:24:57.276 --> 00:24:59.357]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:59.437 --> 00:25:02.137]  All right, let me get into the news here.
[00:25:28.161 --> 00:25:32.965]  Later I am going to read some mean posts and things about myself that people said.
[00:25:32.985 --> 00:25:45.416]  I just want to illustrate the absurdity, the mass mental illness of individuals who will attack a messenger rather than ever actually get involved and fight the New World Order.
[00:25:46.397 --> 00:25:55.125]  You notice the people that do their critiquing of the Patriot Movement, the Truth Movement, you notice they don't do hardly anything exposing the globalists or any of the crime syndicates operations.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.763]  They just expose everyone that's exposing it and tell you how they're bad.
[00:26:00.484 --> 00:26:05.348]  And these little copycats go out and regurgitate and repeat it over and over again.
[00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:09.812]  So maybe I'll talk a little bit about that mentality later.
[00:26:10.212 --> 00:26:12.254]  But it is what keeps populations enslaved.
[00:26:12.314 --> 00:26:14.896]  One of the key reasons that happens.
[00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:23.088]  Microsoft unveils an in-car computer system, and of course it tracks everything you do.
[00:26:23.468 --> 00:26:25.228]  The new smart cars are here, as we told you.
[00:26:25.268 --> 00:26:26.288]  Cameras will watch you.
[00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:28.289]  Sensors will track everything you do.
[00:26:28.609 --> 00:26:30.390]  But they're selling it to you as luxury.
[00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:39.092]  I see all these people, you know, I'll see them outside an IHOP or at the mall, and they'll have their $100,000 Mercedes, and with pleasure, they thumb scan.
[00:26:39.532 --> 00:26:39.672]  Ooh!
[00:26:40.132 --> 00:26:41.693]  Oh, that's a powerful boo!
[00:26:42.193 --> 00:26:43.153]  Oh, I get it!
[00:26:43.253 --> 00:26:44.333]  It's just, it's a joke!
[00:26:44.753 --> 00:26:46.754]  The elite knows how to sell slavery, folks.
[00:26:48.582 --> 00:26:53.446]  I call it the Chinese Princess Syndrome.
[00:26:53.666 --> 00:27:08.677]  Different guilds going back three, four, five thousand years ago would figure out how to enslave the higher caste and then basically make themselves the higher level servant class, the true behind the throne power.
[00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:13.120]  I might as well just talk about this now.
[00:27:13.581 --> 00:27:17.744]  They tell them, oh you're so beautiful when your feet look this certain way.
[00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:32.858]  And over just a few generations, they'd get it to where the women couldn't even walk because their feet had been bound so tightly, their toes under their feet.
[00:27:34.659 --> 00:27:36.940]  And it was the same thing with their fingernails.
[00:27:38.761 --> 00:27:40.742]  Oh, you know, no one can talk to you.
[00:27:40.802 --> 00:27:42.043]  You're the male emperor.
[00:27:42.523 --> 00:27:45.005]  You're so powerful, only the priests can go out and
[00:27:46.497 --> 00:27:47.818]  Intercede with the people.
[00:27:48.759 --> 00:27:51.582]  No one can even look at you because you're a god emperor.
[00:27:52.242 --> 00:27:53.223]  Really, they were in prison.
[00:27:53.944 --> 00:28:01.050]  And the women would have these big, five foot, three foot long fingernails, all disgusting and curled.
[00:28:03.913 --> 00:28:05.074]  You see, that's how they do it.
[00:28:05.154 --> 00:28:06.575]  And that's what they do with women today.
[00:28:06.795 --> 00:28:11.820]  Oh, you've got to be totally skinny and look like a 15-year-old track runner.
[00:28:13.008 --> 00:28:16.932]  And, uh, oh, you've got to have lips that look like they're a big baboon's.
[00:28:17.732 --> 00:28:21.175]  And, oh, you've got to, you know, have all this.
[00:28:21.216 --> 00:28:25.199]  So you feel inadequate, so they can sell you a bunch of garbage!
[00:28:29.843 --> 00:28:38.711]  To the point of, you want a new car and you can't even buy it because it's got so much... ...digitry and gadgetry and... ...fandangled garbage on it.
[00:28:40.405 --> 00:28:43.606]  Military strike is the only way to stop Iran, says top Israeli strategist.
[00:28:44.346 --> 00:28:46.627]  They're beating the drum big time to start attacking Iran.
[00:28:46.687 --> 00:28:47.448]  I can't believe this.
[00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:49.328]  This is a subject I should be talking about.
[00:28:50.329 --> 00:28:51.549]  And we're going to talk about it today.
[00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.710]  Israel divulges plan to nuke Iran.
[00:28:57.231 --> 00:28:58.912]  Surge in troops isn't enough, U.S.
[00:28:58.952 --> 00:28:59.852]  Commander says.
[00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:04.814]  Warrior of the Democrats sets stage for Iran attack.
[00:29:07.037 --> 00:29:08.658]  This is out of an Israeli newspaper.
[00:29:08.778 --> 00:29:10.398]  Israel's vital first strike.
[00:29:11.098 --> 00:29:13.119]  This is from the horse's mouth.
[00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.420]  Another story out of the LA Times.
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:18.541]  First wiretapping, now letter opening.
[00:29:22.022 --> 00:29:24.763]  Fair jury could crack Diana Kovarub.
[00:29:25.914 --> 00:29:31.640]  Queen backs away from royal jury as whitewash charges preempt inquest hearing.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.802]  You have your inquest, okay?
[00:29:34.122 --> 00:29:34.843]  Your inquest.
[00:29:34.903 --> 00:29:36.024]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[00:29:36.064 --> 00:29:37.125]  We know you murdered her.
[00:29:37.506 --> 00:29:40.409]  The British people, it was 79% a few years ago.
[00:29:40.469 --> 00:29:43.572]  Now it's almost 90% in major polls last week.
[00:29:44.444 --> 00:29:47.206]  It's like George Bush Sr.
[00:29:47.267 --> 00:29:56.854]  at Ford's funeral saying, doesn't matter what you conspiracy theorists say, we know a lone nut acted alone, and we know Gerald Ford says so, so it must be true.
[00:29:57.935 --> 00:30:00.577]  People used to be gullible and buy your baloney.
[00:30:00.977 --> 00:30:02.258]  They don't buy it anymore.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.122]  But it's gotten so bad, people buy nothing.
[00:30:08.023 --> 00:30:11.566]  I haven't really talked about that paradigm, or that enigma.
[00:30:12.768 --> 00:30:14.068]  That's not the proper term.
[00:30:14.989 --> 00:30:18.309]  In my allergy-hazed brain, I'll come up with the right word and we'll be back.
[00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:22.150]  After this quick break, I'm Alejandro Jones.
[00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:25.191]  It's the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:30:25.811 --> 00:30:26.731]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.212 --> 00:30:28.812]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:29.732 --> 00:30:32.393]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:36.388 --> 00:30:38.730]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.991]  When was the last time you used Pure Soap?
[00:30:41.151 --> 00:30:48.196]  I mean real hard to find all natural Pure Soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[00:30:48.456 --> 00:30:57.082]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company, for the past 57 years, has been making triple concentrated Pure Soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.
[00:30:57.382 --> 00:31:02.005]  Now for the first time Calvin Pure Soap is available factory direct to you and your family

[00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:37.631]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[00:31:37.951 --> 00:31:46.555]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[00:31:46.915 --> 00:31:52.638]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[00:31:53.038 --> 00:32:00.503]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[00:32:00.803 --> 00:32:06.146]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[00:32:06.446 --> 00:32:10.389]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[00:32:10.689 --> 00:32:16.893]  All markers include a three-eighths inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod, painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[00:32:17.193 --> 00:32:19.935]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?

[00:32:26.219 --> 00:32:27.080]  That's Davis-Products.com.
[00:32:36.417 --> 00:32:40.360]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.143]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:32:44.423 --> 00:32:48.506]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:32:48.786 --> 00:32:49.727]  I was so amazed.
[00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:52.829]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.851]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:32:55.251 --> 00:33:00.493]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:33:00.913 --> 00:33:06.836]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[00:33:07.096 --> 00:33:08.817]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:33:09.077 --> 00:33:12.238]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:33:12.458 --> 00:33:16.360]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.121]  Plus, the service was great.
[00:33:18.421 --> 00:33:23.103]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.
[00:33:23.703 --> 00:33:27.524]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com or call 312-224-2710.
[00:33:27.544 --> 00:33:27.584]  312-224-2710.
[00:33:27.644 --> 00:33:30.566]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[00:33:51.543 --> 00:33:53.984]  George Strait was the same.
[00:33:54.064 --> 00:33:56.625]  Seashores of old Mexico.
[00:33:57.966 --> 00:34:02.387]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[00:34:02.507 --> 00:34:06.369]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:11.131]  Longstar State should be renamed Texico.
[00:34:13.652 --> 00:34:17.993]  So long Texas, hello Mexico.
[00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:25.908]  I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso.
[00:34:28.309 --> 00:34:30.251]  I'm leaving tonight.
[00:34:30.491 --> 00:34:32.132]  I ain't gonna pack.
[00:34:32.613 --> 00:34:36.015]  I'm only taking the clothes on my back.
[00:34:36.756 --> 00:34:38.077]  So long, Texas.
[00:34:38.717 --> 00:34:40.599]  Hello, Mexico.
[00:34:50.916 --> 00:34:55.657]  I'll drive a rattle-trap car with no liability.
[00:34:58.737 --> 00:35:03.378]  I'll demand equal rights though I'm there illegally.
[00:35:06.219 --> 00:35:10.479]  I'll protest in the streets till they finally grant them.
[00:35:10.499 --> 00:35:13.720]  Sing English words to their national anthem.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:15.380]  Hey, Vincente!
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:18.661]  What's right for your people should be right for me.
[00:35:21.773 --> 00:35:26.756]  There goes controlling that tide that keeps flowing across the line.
[00:35:28.597 --> 00:35:35.921]  This old Texas cowboy feels like my home state's no longer mine.
[00:35:36.722 --> 00:35:37.982]  So long, Texas.
[00:35:38.683 --> 00:35:40.784]  Hello, Mexico.
[00:35:43.686 --> 00:35:48.068]  I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso.
[00:35:51.415 --> 00:35:52.756]  I'm leaving tonight.
[00:35:53.256 --> 00:35:54.677]  I ain't gonna crack.
[00:35:55.117 --> 00:35:58.479]  I'm only taking the clothes on my back.
[00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.660]  So long, Texas.
[00:36:01.501 --> 00:36:04.202]  Hello, Mexico!
[00:36:07.244 --> 00:36:07.404]  Yep.
[00:36:08.465 --> 00:36:10.326]  Turnabout's fair play.
[00:36:10.526 --> 00:36:13.027]  Heck, I already love the food.
[00:36:13.247 --> 00:36:15.409]  And tequila.
[00:36:16.861 --> 00:36:22.083]  I'm gonna fly that Longstar flag at Old Flora every day.
[00:36:22.284 --> 00:36:25.045]  I'm gonna celebrate every Fourth of July.
[00:36:25.665 --> 00:36:29.427]  I'm gonna make them print them forms in English just for me.
[00:36:29.507 --> 00:36:32.888]  I'm gonna marry me a pretty secret reader.
[00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:37.510]  We're gonna have free medical care and free education for all our kids.
[00:36:38.451 --> 00:36:38.631]  Heck,
[00:36:39.475 --> 00:36:40.955]  That is really something else.
[00:36:40.975 --> 00:36:44.816]  The word I was looking for is a paradox.
[00:36:44.876 --> 00:36:45.856]  In the last segment.
[00:37:10.109 --> 00:37:21.898]  We've gotten the public to the point where they do not trust the mainstream media, and they do not trust the government, either political party, but they don't have the details.
[00:37:22.018 --> 00:37:24.600]  People know they've been lied to a thousand times a thousand.
[00:37:26.121 --> 00:37:35.868]  And they know that there's a world government, and they know that there's a police state, and they know that things aren't going in the right direction, but they don't understand, on average, the nuts and bolts of it.
[00:37:37.529 --> 00:37:38.190]  And they don't know
[00:37:39.386 --> 00:37:40.046]  What to trust?
[00:37:40.086 --> 00:37:41.687]  They just know they can't trust anything.
[00:37:42.127 --> 00:37:45.488]  And that's where research comes in, and that's where... I mean, it does.
[00:37:45.528 --> 00:37:51.691]  It takes years of research of the New World Order system to really be able to figure out what their operational plan is.
[00:37:51.711 --> 00:37:58.113]  But once you see it, then it just... you exponentially start learning, and more and more integrates together.
[00:37:58.953 --> 00:38:02.235]  The problem is trying to articulate something this big.
[00:38:04.175 --> 00:38:05.436]  Something this huge.
[00:38:06.511 --> 00:38:16.995]  I mean, they got professors at major universities, say, up in Missouri, who spend their whole lives, you know, just studying the aquifer for that area.
[00:38:17.315 --> 00:38:31.340]  And they write five books, and they'll tell you those five books just on that aquifer up there don't even scratch the surface of the mysteries of it, and how it operates, and where it feeds, and how important it is.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:34.641]  Well, that's just one little aquifer in one little state.
[00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:51.597]  I mean, imagine trying to explain the way the toll roads work, and how they tie into the World Bank, and how the whole system comes down, and how the CPS is tied into it, the drugging of the population, and the feminism, and just all of it!
[00:38:53.618 --> 00:38:56.339]  I mean, literally, it's like somebody saying,
[00:38:58.863 --> 00:39:03.186]  You know, explain to me what a blue whale looks like.
[00:39:03.287 --> 00:39:24.183]  Well, it's grayish black colored, and it's big, and fat, and it's got... You've got to see it to... Or be like, well, describe what that blue whale looks like swimming in the northern Pacific Ocean, in the mountain range, 50 miles away, and what the sunset looks like, and the colors of that sunset.
[00:39:24.873 --> 00:39:29.895]  And what the ripples on the waves look like, and the sea foam slapping up against the ship.
[00:39:32.096 --> 00:39:36.158]  Even if I'd ever been there and seen that and done that, I couldn't describe it and I haven't.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.063]  So, when people tell me, oh man, you're saying it's worse than it is.
[00:39:47.444 --> 00:39:50.565]  Oh man, you are exaggerating.
[00:39:52.306 --> 00:39:54.407]  Oh man, it's not as bad as you say.
[00:39:57.006 --> 00:39:58.266]  You're right, it's a lot worse.
[00:39:58.766 --> 00:40:09.689]  And it's so much worse... Well, the Bible says that... What, on the Isle of Patmos, he marveled at the beast?
[00:40:10.689 --> 00:40:11.690]  He marveled at it?
[00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:15.751]  The text of Mars calls it dark majesty?
[00:40:20.312 --> 00:40:21.572]  My little pea brain...
[00:40:22.777 --> 00:40:32.030]  Can behold the New World Order beast system, but I sure can't articulate it fully to you.
[00:40:34.614 --> 00:40:34.914]  I can't.
[00:40:37.029 --> 00:41:02.050]  I mean, when I get up on air and I say, here's Google in a hundred plus page press release, bragging that they're going to use the microphones and cameras built standard on almost all new computers, on most old ones, to listen to every word you say in your house, and use keyword computers to file all that, and build a digital psychological algorithm on you, a profile, they're going to sell that data to anybody who wants it.
[00:41:05.413 --> 00:41:14.876]  I mean that's so bad I should begin, a normal response would be to freak out and run down the street screaming saying there's cameras and microphones hidden in all your houses.
[00:41:16.797 --> 00:41:26.800]  I mean imagine if you were changing a light bulb and you just came across a camera.
[00:41:29.605 --> 00:41:35.649]  A little camera, and you found the wire and it went up in the ceiling, and it was hooked up to a battery pack and a wireless transmitter in your attic.
[00:41:35.929 --> 00:41:37.891]  You'd freak out, you'd call the police, you'd go nuts.
[00:41:40.933 --> 00:41:45.636]  It's like these women, uh, who, it just happened in, what, Florida, but every few weeks it's in the news.
[00:41:45.996 --> 00:41:55.403]  They're in a tanning salon, they're at a gym, uh, they're at some kind of day spa, and, uh, they're, you know, getting dressed, getting undressed, it's all on tape.
[00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:05.567]  And they get real mad, they run out screaming and call the police and the cops come and, man, it's a big deal and we're all upset and it's big national news!
[00:42:08.209 --> 00:42:11.191]  But Google announces that they're doing it.
[00:42:13.253 --> 00:42:14.895]  And then they list other companies.
[00:42:16.997 --> 00:42:20.299]  You know, I'm the type of weirdo, I read the whole hundred and something page press release.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.062]  And then I went and read accompanying documents.
[00:42:25.029 --> 00:42:37.480]  And I found out about three other companies that are doing it, but Google brags that their system using your microphone and camera, without asking you by the way, to track everything you're doing, works much better than other systems.
[00:42:39.161 --> 00:42:44.566]  They list some Japanese system, some German system, and we wrote an article about it and posted links to it.
[00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:49.510]  And millions of people read that story.
[00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:50.531]  That story went big.
[00:42:51.932 --> 00:42:53.193]  Last time I checked it was like
[00:42:54.088 --> 00:42:58.769]  Four million people on PrisonPlanet.com had clicked through on that story, but it had been copied everywhere.
[00:42:58.789 --> 00:43:01.970]  That's where it gets real readership, is on hundreds of blogs and other sites.
[00:43:02.590 --> 00:43:10.193]  And I mean, it must have been over ten big technology publications wrote about our story, and none of them denied it.
[00:43:10.993 --> 00:43:14.614]  A few said, this is terrible, but most of them just said, well, what's the big deal?
[00:43:18.755 --> 00:43:18.955]  See?
[00:43:20.752 --> 00:43:25.416]  So, you've all been brainwashed, myself included.
[00:43:26.056 --> 00:43:27.958]  We're all brainwashed, folks.
[00:43:28.538 --> 00:43:33.282]  What is the conditioning that if some big corporation does this to us, then well, that's alright.
[00:43:33.602 --> 00:43:37.064]  It's alright for them to be watching me and listening to me, without asking.
[00:43:39.927 --> 00:43:48.353]  But then, if somebody did it to you at work, or somebody did it to you in the bathroom, then it's a terrible thing.
[00:43:51.756 --> 00:43:57.842]  I guess to a certain point, I mean, it's okay for there to be cameras in the bathrooms all over the country now.
[00:43:58.582 --> 00:43:59.463]  Hundreds of reports.
[00:43:59.924 --> 00:44:01.885]  Hundreds and hundreds of school districts I've seen doing it.
[00:44:02.226 --> 00:44:03.527]  I mean, in the stalls.
[00:44:04.247 --> 00:44:04.968]  And they'll defend it.
[00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:09.272]  And then I guess if it's the authorities, it's okay.
[00:44:09.292 --> 00:44:15.718]  See, if it's Google, or it's the authorities, the officials, our masters, then it's alright.
[00:44:19.224 --> 00:44:22.928]  I mean, to me, that is a big deal.
[00:44:25.731 --> 00:44:27.112]  For them to announce they're doing that.
[00:44:27.152 --> 00:44:29.895]  And we already told you they were, but now it's announced.
[00:44:31.417 --> 00:44:32.518]  That's a big deal to us.
[00:44:34.614 --> 00:44:49.058]  When DARPA told the Baltimore Sun that they were developing systems for different wavelength broadcasting towers to control the moods of large cities, we thought it was something you might want to be concerned about.
[00:44:49.078 --> 00:44:53.579]  I mean, I think that's pretty wild.
[00:44:53.639 --> 00:44:56.860]  That's run-down-the-street screaming weird.
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:58.480]  That's a real response.
[00:44:59.913 --> 00:45:00.613]  Oh my gosh!
[00:45:00.633 --> 00:45:02.854]  They're putting up systems to control our brains!
[00:45:03.255 --> 00:45:04.075]  Mind control!
[00:45:04.675 --> 00:45:06.116]  You know, fight back everyone!
[00:45:06.156 --> 00:45:06.936]  Let's get together!
[00:45:07.016 --> 00:45:07.436]  Rally!
[00:45:07.476 --> 00:45:09.597]  Pull down the tower before they turn them on!
[00:45:09.998 --> 00:45:10.938]  Officer, help me!
[00:45:11.658 --> 00:45:13.339]  That officer'd gun you down in a minute.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:17.421]  What happened to us along the way, folks?
[00:45:17.441 --> 00:45:19.782]  There's been major brainwashing through television.
[00:45:20.182 --> 00:45:23.604]  And then people who are brainwashed didn't mimic it in the real world.
[00:45:24.444 --> 00:45:26.865]  And... So then there's peer pressure.
[00:45:32.811 --> 00:45:53.808]  I mean, when the major newspapers like the Chicago Tribune have two different reports admitting that Dinecore and Halliburton run giant child kidnapping and woman kidnapping rings, and that they have full-time lobbyists on Capitol Hill lobbying Congress to not order the Pentagon to enforce the laws when they do this on base.
[00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:01.094]  And it says it all in black and white, and it's a minor footnote, and I'm the bad person
[00:46:01.849 --> 00:46:03.050]  For covering it on air.
[00:46:03.431 --> 00:46:04.332]  I'm the extremist.
[00:46:04.412 --> 00:46:06.093]  I shouldn't be so upset.
[00:46:08.456 --> 00:46:11.158]  So again, I'm upset by them destroying the value of the dollar.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:16.083]  I'm upset about destroying our borders.
[00:46:17.665 --> 00:46:21.168]  And Mexican troops routinely overrunning and killing police and shooting people.
[00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:24.592]  I am upset about
[00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.493]  Millions and millions of brain-damaged autistic children from mercury and the vaccines.
[00:46:31.673 --> 00:46:32.293]  No debating it.
[00:46:32.673 --> 00:46:33.254]  No doubting it.
[00:46:33.714 --> 00:46:35.415]  Hundreds of scientific studies and reports.
[00:46:37.636 --> 00:46:40.338]  I am upset about hundreds of big things.
[00:46:40.418 --> 00:46:51.045]  And you bet I get up here on air, and I don't spend my time talking about Britney Spears, and I don't spend my time talking about Paris Hilton, and I don't spend my time up here
[00:46:51.969 --> 00:46:55.431]  Talking about Nancy Pelosi or, you know, who's going to run for president.
[00:46:55.752 --> 00:46:57.012]  My answer is, who cares?
[00:46:57.373 --> 00:46:58.333]  They're all going to be puppets.
[00:46:58.353 --> 00:47:02.516]  They're all going to be selected out of a controlled group to begin with, so it doesn't matter.
[00:47:04.257 --> 00:47:04.898]  I mean, you bet.
[00:47:04.958 --> 00:47:09.401]  I get up here and I talk about what I think is the most important thing.
[00:47:10.642 --> 00:47:11.202]  Period.
[00:47:14.864 --> 00:47:15.545]  That's what I do.
[00:47:19.702 --> 00:47:25.246]  And I don't sit up here and go, well, let me do a popularity contest or, you know, if I have what view, what will be the most popular?
[00:47:25.666 --> 00:47:26.747]  That's what most talk show hosts do.
[00:47:26.767 --> 00:47:28.628]  They go, what will be the most popular on talk radio?
[00:47:29.108 --> 00:47:30.329]  What will get me on the most stations?
[00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:36.433]  Being pro-Nuke the Middle East, pro-war, pro-George Bush, pro-North American Union.
[00:47:38.335 --> 00:47:41.417]  But it's not just what's popular with the people.
[00:47:42.097 --> 00:47:45.039]  They also got to do what's popular with the big networks that own them.
[00:47:48.762 --> 00:47:49.162]  And that's
[00:47:52.933 --> 00:47:56.974]  Pitch unpopular things and say the North American Union's good.
[00:47:58.315 --> 00:48:05.517]  I mean, I've got the transcripts now where that little snake, Michael Medved, who said I should be arrested, he said that years ago.
[00:48:07.078 --> 00:48:07.858]  I should be arrested.
[00:48:09.859 --> 00:48:10.539]  Got a tape of it.
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:13.520]  In fact, it's in the computer up there at the network.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:15.441]  We could probably dig it out from two years ago and play it.
[00:48:17.522 --> 00:48:21.063]  Well, he's now saying, Dr. Jerome, of course he's a liar.
[00:48:23.286 --> 00:48:29.191]  Now, of course he wants to go to war with the Middle East, and of course he's, you know... But he's starting to wake up.
[00:48:29.411 --> 00:48:33.454]  But at least he knows the North American Union is real and gets the actual documents.
[00:48:34.675 --> 00:48:37.938]  And so now all the big national hosts, including Medved, are attacking him.
[00:48:41.541 --> 00:48:43.282]  And calling him a liar.
[00:48:43.542 --> 00:48:45.103]  They give no evidence, no facts.
[00:48:46.264 --> 00:48:47.625]  Well, that's like Lars Larson.
[00:48:48.306 --> 00:48:50.628]  I was on his show for an hour and I couldn't believe the guy.
[00:48:51.545 --> 00:48:53.706]  Was defending the North American Union.
[00:48:56.006 --> 00:48:56.987]  That's what they do!
[00:48:59.728 --> 00:49:02.549]  Now, all those years, Limbaugh said the kook detector test.
[00:49:02.989 --> 00:49:07.310]  There's no CFR, there's no world government, there's no plan for the UN takeover.
[00:49:07.330 --> 00:49:08.330]  If you say it, you're a kook.
[00:49:09.191 --> 00:49:12.652]  Now, okay, well, yeah, there's a North American Union, but it's okay.
[00:49:14.292 --> 00:49:16.173]  They're there to pacify conservatives.
[00:49:24.973 --> 00:49:31.758]  Most of the attacks that I've received have been so ridiculous and so baseless, I never respond to them.
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.120]  Well, that's not accurate.
[00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.641]  I don't respond to them most times.
[00:49:35.681 --> 00:49:36.742]  They're fielded at me.
[00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:43.007]  Because, you know, for somebody who finds some accusation about me, it's always brand new for them.
[00:49:43.708 --> 00:49:47.751]  They email me and say, you need to answer for this right now.
[00:49:49.012 --> 00:49:50.713]  Well, I've answered for it 50 times.
[00:49:52.688 --> 00:49:57.131]  But the fifty times I answered for it was probably one out of a hundred times that I was challenged.
[00:49:58.692 --> 00:50:06.717]  If I spent my life answering for all the baloney that's thrown at me, we would never talk about real issues here.
[00:50:07.798 --> 00:50:10.019]  You would hear a show that was all about me.
[00:50:13.301 --> 00:50:19.345]  You need to answer for that Order of Death flag you had, that Illuminati flag on your TV show.
[00:50:20.379 --> 00:50:27.285]  No, it's liberty, militia, liberty or death, the New Hampshire slogan.
[00:50:28.025 --> 00:50:28.906]  Don't tread on me.
[00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:30.888]  It's something I need to answer for?
[00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:33.410]  Hell, now that people are out there saying that, it'll never end.
[00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:40.956]  Twenty years from now, I'll have somebody saddle up to me at a bus stop and go, you need to answer for that death flag!
[00:50:40.976 --> 00:50:45.459]  Well, you need to answer for America being a police state.
[00:50:45.479 --> 00:50:48.742]  Didn't you go do something about it, or are you just ninny and nitpick all day?
[00:50:51.474 --> 00:51:04.897]  The most insane thing that has no basis in reality, but that's what the Feds do, and this does come from the Feds, no doubt, is that this show and this network is owned by Disney and ABC.
[00:51:07.078 --> 00:51:12.820]  No connection to reality, a total and complete lie.
[00:51:15.220 --> 00:51:18.421]  And they'll sit there with straight faces and say it.
[00:51:23.661 --> 00:51:26.225]  Because, see, they don't want you to know something's legitimate.
[00:51:26.585 --> 00:51:28.668]  They don't want you to focus on fighting the new war.
[00:51:29.229 --> 00:51:32.854]  They want you to focus on not believing the messenger.
[00:51:33.054 --> 00:51:34.697]  Don't believe me, just check out the facts!
[00:51:35.905 --> 00:51:43.831]  For years you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained the leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[00:51:44.311 --> 00:51:47.433]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?
[00:51:47.853 --> 00:51:50.875]  The answer is high quality and huge selection.

[00:52:32.629 --> 00:52:34.410]  Working with the power of nature.
[00:52:38.613 --> 00:52:39.173]  It's here.
[00:52:39.333 --> 00:52:44.117]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:52:44.477 --> 00:52:52.122]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:52:52.805 --> 00:52:59.847]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:53:00.248 --> 00:53:11.651]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:53:11.992 --> 00:53:15.513]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:53:15.953 --> 00:53:17.894]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:53:18.214 --> 00:53:22.055]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:35.715 --> 00:53:40.940]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:49.167]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:53:49.427 --> 00:53:56.493]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:53:56.653 --> 00:53:57.934]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:53:58.014 --> 00:54:03.898]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:54:04.098 --> 00:54:09.182]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:54:09.322 --> 00:54:18.189]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:54:18.449 --> 00:54:23.052]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[00:54:56.138 --> 00:55:01.781]  No, it makes the feds really mad that we won't discredit ourselves here on the show with racism.
[00:55:04.021 --> 00:55:08.663]  It makes them really mad that there's nothing to burn us with, there's no skeletons in the closet.
[00:55:10.084 --> 00:55:13.585]  It really upsets them that they can't get a handle on me and what I do.
[00:55:14.846 --> 00:55:18.127]  And so they just make up mindless information.
[00:55:18.827 --> 00:55:21.008]  And the only reason I'm bringing this up today is because
[00:55:22.276 --> 00:55:26.337]  Every day of every week of every year, it's always the same.
[00:55:26.397 --> 00:55:28.237]  You need to answer for this!
[00:55:28.377 --> 00:55:30.058]  You need to answer for that!
[00:55:31.238 --> 00:55:34.758]  And I just can't believe how it's always so stupid!
[00:55:36.579 --> 00:55:39.759]  I mean, so ridiculous!
[00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:46.521]  And it's like serialized comic books, the lies that are told about me.
[00:55:46.541 --> 00:55:48.421]  And that shows you we're having an effect
[00:55:49.091 --> 00:55:51.332]  It shows you that the enemy is upset.
[00:55:51.492 --> 00:55:54.453]  We are over the target and we are getting the flag.
[00:55:56.594 --> 00:56:01.276]  And it's on days when I'm tired and I don't want to come into a radio show or I don't want to stay up here late at night and work.
[00:56:01.816 --> 00:56:03.317]  It is actually sick.
[00:56:06.558 --> 00:56:12.741]  Because I should come in here and work extra hard for my family and my country and that's a large part of it.
[00:56:14.542 --> 00:56:20.627]  But one of the main reasons I do is because I don't want to let the bastards grind me down, as they say.
[00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:23.769]  And I'm not going to.
[00:56:25.150 --> 00:56:26.371]  I'm not going to back off, ever.
[00:56:28.133 --> 00:56:31.535]  And the more attacks I receive, the more I'm going to do.
[00:56:33.317 --> 00:56:38.421]  And God willing, and this is what I've seen in the past, I'll be here moving forward, fighting the New World Order.
[00:56:39.742 --> 00:56:43.705]  You know, as the COINTELPRO outfits, and I see them come and go, lose their funding.
[00:56:44.381 --> 00:56:46.963]  And just go off into oblivion, or as they get exposed.
[00:56:48.744 --> 00:56:49.664]  So that's the good news.
[00:56:49.824 --> 00:56:51.526]  I've been kind of a space case today.
[00:56:51.546 --> 00:56:54.607]  I've got all this news here in front of me.
[00:56:54.788 --> 00:56:56.989]  They shut down part of downtown today.
[00:56:57.069 --> 00:56:58.870]  They were saying it might be terrorists.
[00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:59.671]  Oh my gosh.
[00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:04.133]  Police officers got sick and had to go to the hospital.
[00:57:07.495 --> 00:57:10.077]  Several dozen pigeons died downtown.
[00:57:12.808 --> 00:57:15.211]  From the Capitol down to First Street.
[00:57:16.612 --> 00:57:19.155]  So I don't know, what is that, 600 yards or so?
[00:57:20.877 --> 00:57:34.411]  And they closed Congress and a few side streets from 3 in the morning until supposedly in the next hour or so, they're going to be opening Congress back up.
[00:57:38.486 --> 00:57:41.407]  And I don't know the truth about what happened down there.
[00:57:41.567 --> 00:57:45.009]  I know that neocons instantly were covering it.
[00:57:46.169 --> 00:57:48.290]  And that makes my suspicion level go up.
[00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:50.391]  But again, it's a very complex issue.
[00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:54.312]  I tend to believe somebody just poisoned a bunch of pigeons.
[00:57:54.372 --> 00:57:59.294]  And as of last break, the news locally is saying the same thing.
[00:58:00.094 --> 00:58:03.235]  Now they think somebody poisoned the pigeons, but they're testing them.
[00:58:04.916 --> 00:58:07.237]  And you're like, Alex, they're talking about attacking Iran.
[00:58:08.237 --> 00:58:10.118]  Why are you talking about dead pigeons?
[00:58:10.178 --> 00:58:13.299]  Well, I mean, this goes to the hysteria.
[00:58:14.179 --> 00:58:20.481]  You've got a better chance of being struck by lightning than you do of dying from a terrorist attack.
[00:58:20.521 --> 00:58:21.902]  And that's when they average 9-11 in.
[00:58:25.083 --> 00:58:34.646]  It's literally like having a relationship with the Tooth Fairy if you don't average the 3,000 dead on 9-11 in.
[00:58:35.006 --> 00:58:35.626]  It isn't real.
[00:58:35.686 --> 00:58:36.707]  It's a fairy tale without 9-11.
[00:58:40.265 --> 00:58:43.467]  But you'd think it was just a pandemic epidemic.
[00:58:43.487 --> 00:58:48.531]  With as much hype as they've got going, people start jumping at shadows.
[00:58:49.532 --> 00:58:52.634]  So, I know we've got loaded phones here.
[00:58:52.654 --> 00:58:54.336]  I just haven't given the number out yet.
[00:58:54.356 --> 00:58:55.576]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:55.597 --> 00:58:55.677]  800-259-9231.
[00:58:55.717 --> 00:58:57.858]  I've written some notes here about this pigeon thing.
[00:58:57.998 --> 00:59:01.821]  And it's important, because it's going to open up into a bunch of other issues.
[00:59:07.552 --> 00:59:10.276]  I'll do that at the bottom of the next hour, then we'll get into Israel.
[00:59:10.917 --> 00:59:13.221]  But before we do that, we'll take your phone calls.
[00:59:13.241 --> 00:59:14.142]  Stay with us.

[01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:27.503]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:30.746]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:37.296 --> 01:00:41.497]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:42.137 --> 01:00:42.958]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.718 --> 01:00:45.638]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.658 --> 01:00:48.959]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.581]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:59.142 --> 01:01:04.444]  Coming up in half an hour, I'll walk through a mass mind control program
[01:01:05.436 --> 01:01:07.658]  That we can clearly identify and demonstrate.
[01:01:08.779 --> 01:01:23.511]  And a doorway into this larger system is the fact that part of downtown Austin was shut down today, and it's still shut down, last time I checked, because of a bunch of dead pigeons.
[01:01:25.234 --> 01:01:33.659]  And whereas people will just poison pigeons in the past, and that was the end of it, now it causes hysteria because every cop is a wannabe Jack Bauer.
[01:01:34.019 --> 01:01:49.248]  And since terrorism doesn't exist in the real world, outside of government ops, and that is the blue, blue moon, just any excuse to run around in hysteria and fear, cops flopping around sick, collapsing, having to go to the hospital,
[01:01:50.511 --> 01:01:51.311]  Psychosomatic.
[01:01:51.331 --> 01:01:52.992]  They're mental patients, folks.
[01:01:53.072 --> 01:01:55.833]  And that's because they buy in.
[01:01:55.853 --> 01:02:04.755]  And we had two separate PSYOPs that they admitted were PSYOPs in 2000.
[01:02:05.715 --> 01:02:08.316]  Here in Austin.
[01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:09.876]  And I'll tell you about those.
[01:02:10.997 --> 01:02:13.177]  And you know what, Mike Hanson, I know you're busy.
[01:02:14.118 --> 01:02:16.598]  But you've got the master three-quarter inch old tapes.
[01:02:17.539 --> 01:02:18.919]  You're coming to the TV show tonight.
[01:02:20.925 --> 01:02:23.407]  I want you to do whatever you have to.
[01:02:23.427 --> 01:02:28.150]  I want you... This is how I communicate with people now, is over the radio.
[01:02:28.731 --> 01:02:32.513]  I want you to go into your storage area, and I want you... I've asked this before.
[01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:40.759]  I want you to dig out the TV show we did when they did the two fake attacks.
[01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:48.825]  The fake nuclear spill, which we have on video, we did a report on, and the fake bio-attack downtown.
[01:02:50.168 --> 01:02:53.070]  And they also had the fake attack at the DPS.
[01:02:55.152 --> 01:02:57.654]  And then I bluffed them into admitting it was fake on the news.
[01:02:58.154 --> 01:03:00.216]  The local news was involved in it, of course.
[01:03:01.357 --> 01:03:02.638]  I forgot there were three of them.
[01:03:02.678 --> 01:03:04.199]  See, that's another problem.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:13.166]  I'm sitting here, thinking about 30 minutes from now, wanting to cogently go over all the evidence of this, and I... I can't!
[01:03:13.266 --> 01:03:14.187]  I mean, there's too much!
[01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:17.830]  And it's terrorism.
[01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:25.158]  The uh... I'm just totally disgusted.
[01:03:26.399 --> 01:03:27.339]  And then I'm frustrated.
[01:03:27.419 --> 01:03:31.302]  I printed an article here.
[01:03:31.882 --> 01:03:40.569]  There were like ten different articles or more in Texas about the uh... military being involved.
[01:03:40.629 --> 01:03:42.090]  This anti-terrorist squad.
[01:03:42.730 --> 01:03:46.373]  Same guys we've seen running checkpoints long before 9-11 that told us to turn our cameras off.
[01:03:48.019 --> 01:03:51.380]  And their group was listed there, and it didn't print.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:53.280]  See, I print everything.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:59.001]  Because I can't just sit here on the internet and skip around on a web page because I never can find it all.
[01:03:59.821 --> 01:04:02.802]  I printed to have a hard copy of it, and that didn't print.
[01:04:05.762 --> 01:04:09.223]  But it listed that group running around.
[01:04:10.983 --> 01:04:12.463]  It's just a total joke!
[01:04:13.744 --> 01:04:15.604]  That's why they have drills.
[01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:21.155]  To then create the fear and create the perception that it's real.
[01:04:22.096 --> 01:04:23.397]  And that it's a real threat.
[01:04:24.437 --> 01:04:27.140]  So they can then make changes in our liberties and freedoms.
[01:04:30.362 --> 01:04:31.423]  It is a matrix, folks.
[01:04:31.463 --> 01:04:32.904]  We live in a matrix.
[01:04:34.586 --> 01:04:37.448]  And every time they announce the nuclear spill,
[01:04:38.556 --> 01:04:42.719]  Or every time they announced that they'd stopped an Arab downtown.
[01:04:43.059 --> 01:04:43.880]  Turned out it was fake.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:44.540]  It was a drill.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.742]  Cops all over started collapsing.
[01:04:48.883 --> 01:04:50.284]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:04:50.344 --> 01:04:51.525]  Psychosomatic, folks.
[01:04:53.406 --> 01:04:54.807]  Psychosomatic.
[01:04:55.307 --> 01:04:56.568]  And every one of them watches 24.
[01:04:56.708 --> 01:05:00.291]  Every one of them watches these anti-terror shows.
[01:05:01.672 --> 01:05:03.793]  And that's a mass psychosis.
[01:05:05.574 --> 01:05:07.976]  And God help us.
[01:05:08.889 --> 01:05:09.550]  God help us.
[01:05:13.072 --> 01:05:15.114]  Dead pigeons, the police are collapsing.
[01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:17.916]  Oh, don't worry though.
[01:05:17.936 --> 01:05:23.000]  A time's coming when your loving federal masters are gonna release something.
[01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:26.903]  Hell, they already launched an anthrax attack on us back in 2001.
[01:05:26.943 --> 01:05:27.863]  That's just a dry run.
[01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:38.353]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:05:38.653 --> 01:05:44.095]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:05:44.135 --> 01:05:48.416]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:05:48.757 --> 01:05:51.778]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:05:52.098 --> 01:05:55.519]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:05:55.859 --> 01:06:05.201]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:08.962]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:06:09.202 --> 01:06:16.323]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:06:16.563 --> 01:06:17.924]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[01:06:18.004 --> 01:06:19.784]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:06:32.774 --> 01:06:33.354]  It's a fact.
[01:06:33.554 --> 01:06:37.996]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:06:38.436 --> 01:06:43.637]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:06:43.918 --> 01:06:47.119]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:54.481]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:06:54.841 --> 01:07:02.047]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:07:02.468 --> 01:07:04.309]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:07:04.770 --> 01:07:11.095]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:07:11.316 --> 01:07:15.079]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:07:15.439 --> 01:07:18.022]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[01:07:18.062 --> 01:07:18.882]  to 5 p.m.
[01:07:18.942 --> 01:07:20.164]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:07:20.184 --> 01:07:20.364]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:07:20.444 --> 01:07:21.585]  And ask for Robert.
[01:07:21.645 --> 01:07:24.948]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:07:35.649 --> 01:07:41.093]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:07:41.473 --> 01:07:49.118]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:07:49.798 --> 01:07:56.862]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:07:57.262 --> 01:08:08.669]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:08:08.989 --> 01:08:12.491]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:14.872]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:08:15.213 --> 01:08:19.055]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:08:19.655 --> 01:08:31.464]  Get your copy today at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:33.726 --> 01:08:39.330]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:39.450 --> 01:08:47.917]  Alright, we've had the military and the police running around in downtown Austin with some dead pigeons.
[01:08:49.657 --> 01:08:52.638]  Part of New York shut down because of a gas smell.
[01:08:52.678 --> 01:08:54.258]  They think Al Qaeda may be attacking.
[01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:57.819]  This is the type of just hysteria, what they've turned us into.
[01:08:57.839 --> 01:08:59.159]  I'm going to get into it later.
[01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:02.399]  Also Israel openly saying they may nuke Iran.
[01:09:02.959 --> 01:09:04.000]  We'll break that down.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.220]  Right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.821]  Brian in California, you're on the air.
[01:09:08.861 --> 01:09:09.221]  Welcome.
[01:09:10.421 --> 01:09:11.021]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:12.361]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:15.122]  I just want to wish you a Happy New Year, right off the bat.
[01:09:15.182 --> 01:09:15.742]  Happy New Year.
[01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:29.544]  Seen Destroyed by Design is probably one of your most powerful movies, personally for me, because my family actually owns a piece of land near one of these UN-controlled areas.
[01:09:30.305 --> 01:09:32.666]  I talked to a friend of mine over the weekend.
[01:09:32.686 --> 01:09:36.048]  This person's actually in the military, in the Navy.
[01:09:36.909 --> 01:09:45.454]  They were telling me that this person is stationed in the South Pacific, and that they were
[01:09:46.542 --> 01:09:54.987]  Actually, getting ready to deploy towards South Korea, we were gonna head towards North Korea and then attack on North Korea while we were attacking Iran at the same time.
[01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.931]  Go ahead, anything else?
[01:10:01.791 --> 01:10:02.612]  Um, that's it.
[01:10:02.652 --> 01:10:04.753]  I was just wondering if you knew any information on that.
[01:10:06.755 --> 01:10:08.356]  Well, troops get rumors all the time.
[01:10:08.416 --> 01:10:09.856]  It doesn't necessarily mean it's true.
[01:10:10.477 --> 01:10:10.777]  Okay.
[01:10:10.877 --> 01:10:13.719]  But we know that they are certainly discussing a
[01:10:14.938 --> 01:10:43.679]  strike on Iran's facilities and that uh... more than twenty bunker-busting mini-nukes or low-yield weapons have been delivered to Israel in the last two years and we know that uh... there have been open discussions of striking North Korea's facilities and North Korea over the weekend has started rumblings and saber-rattling again that they may test
[01:10:44.745 --> 01:10:46.726]  Another atomic device.
[01:10:48.427 --> 01:10:49.787]  So who knows what's going to happen?
[01:10:50.527 --> 01:10:55.790]  I just know in the case of Iran, they're not anywhere close to an A-bomb, much less a delivery system.
[01:10:56.930 --> 01:11:03.753]  And in the case of North Korea, they've certainly got A-bombs and delivery systems, and our government helped give it all to them.
[01:11:04.733 --> 01:11:05.754]  So it's like the
[01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:18.937]  It's like that imitation that Bill Hicks did of a western, but they do this over and over again in the westerns where the 14-year-old kid comes into town to the general store.
[01:11:19.578 --> 01:11:29.884]  He's, gee mister, I'm just here to get some rock candy and some gigum for my ma and I'm here to get some rope and stuff.
[01:11:30.364 --> 01:11:31.745]  I don't want no trouble.
[01:11:33.612 --> 01:11:41.678]  And the evil hired gunslinger hired by the railroad to run him off their land throws a gun down in front of him and goes, pick up the gun.
[01:11:41.698 --> 01:11:44.980]  And he says, me mister, I really don't want to.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:48.862]  I just want to get my rock candy and go on home.
[01:11:49.422 --> 01:11:50.283]  Pick up the gun.
[01:11:51.384 --> 01:11:54.586]  And then he says, no mister, no.
[01:11:54.606 --> 01:11:56.687]  And he says, ah shit, pick it up.
[01:11:57.167 --> 01:11:59.749]  So the teenager goes to pick it up and he
[01:12:02.555 --> 01:12:03.335]  You saw him.
[01:12:03.855 --> 01:12:04.936]  He had a gun.
[01:12:06.276 --> 01:12:07.997]  And, uh, it's just a sick joke.
[01:12:08.837 --> 01:12:10.878]  But, but, who knows what's gonna happen.
[01:12:10.898 --> 01:12:13.458]  Brian, I want you to have a great New Year, too, my friend.
[01:12:13.999 --> 01:12:14.619]  Thank you very much.
[01:12:14.979 --> 01:12:15.679]  Good to hear from you.
[01:12:16.559 --> 01:12:18.640]  John in California, you're on the air.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:19.140]  Go ahead.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.241]  Hello?
[01:12:21.501 --> 01:12:21.861]  Hi!
[01:12:23.021 --> 01:12:30.764]  Yeah, I called you yesterday about the, uh, Secretary of the Federal Reserve being arrested in Germany.
[01:12:32.401 --> 01:12:34.523]  I may have given you the wrong website.
[01:12:34.643 --> 01:12:39.227]  That's www.worldreports.org.
[01:12:40.287 --> 01:12:43.090]  If you go to the archives, you can pick up that article.
[01:12:43.450 --> 01:12:48.014]  Oh, tell me the name of the supposed person that got arrested.
[01:12:48.994 --> 01:12:58.002]  Well, it's the Secretary of the Treasury, Paulson, and he was arrested and released.
[01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:00.764]  It's about WANTA.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:04.481]  Oh, I don't believe any of that.
[01:13:04.862 --> 01:13:05.782]  I don't buy any of that.
[01:13:06.262 --> 01:13:07.323]  Absolutely zero.
[01:13:08.303 --> 01:13:10.384]  Well, it's all over the website.
[01:13:11.065 --> 01:13:11.865]  Believe me, I know.
[01:13:12.185 --> 01:13:12.746]  Now I know.
[01:13:12.766 --> 01:13:13.406]  That's what I thought.
[01:13:13.766 --> 01:13:15.007]  That's where I thought you were going.
[01:13:15.027 --> 01:13:16.287]  Listen, man.
[01:13:17.708 --> 01:13:25.132]  And it's not bad of you to ask, but it sounds like you may just want to believe what they're saying, so just go ahead and believe them.
[01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:27.493]  Don't let me get in the way of your happiness and success.
[01:13:28.073 --> 01:13:29.994]  Would you please check the website out?
[01:13:30.055 --> 01:13:30.915]  I know all about it.
[01:13:31.994 --> 01:13:33.095]  I know all about it.
[01:13:33.115 --> 01:13:34.675]  I've been hearing about it for three years.
[01:13:35.476 --> 01:13:36.837]  Well, this is all new.
[01:13:36.897 --> 01:13:37.797]  It just happened.
[01:13:38.037 --> 01:13:38.297]  No.
[01:13:38.998 --> 01:13:43.520]  In the world record... Listen, we heard, and I appreciate your call.
[01:13:50.724 --> 01:13:54.766]  Nobody wants to write an article about the $3.9 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[01:13:54.806 --> 01:13:55.166]  Nobody.
[01:13:56.427 --> 01:13:57.467]  Maybe we should write another one.
[01:13:58.748 --> 01:14:00.989]  The AP wrote a few, but I mean, none of the alternative media.
[01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:06.754]  I mean, you've got trillions missing, admittedly.
[01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.077]  And congressional hearings about it.
[01:14:11.338 --> 01:14:12.899]  And the average American's never heard of it.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.342]  You've got comprehensive annual financial reports.
[01:14:17.323 --> 01:14:27.471]  Trillions and trillions of dollars, with the thousands of water districts, and the thousands of school districts, and the states, and the feds, and all the agencies.
[01:14:28.752 --> 01:14:29.393]  It's a joke!
[01:14:32.205 --> 01:14:37.927]  Money you hear about that's on the budget is the pension funds, and the expenditures, and the payrolls, and what the government's got to do.
[01:14:38.827 --> 01:14:39.287]  And debts.
[01:14:40.827 --> 01:14:43.988]  The Comprehensive Annual Financial Report is the real set of books.
[01:14:46.929 --> 01:14:58.932]  And on average, a governmental body has more than double the assets off books that the public even is aware of.
[01:15:01.704 --> 01:15:18.556]  An example is, they'll always tell you, there's no money for ambulances, no money to give the cops raises, no money for school teachers, we may have to shut down and only have four days of school this year, and everybody buys it like suckas, and they go and they pass a bond package.
[01:15:19.637 --> 01:15:24.400]  Then not one red cent of that bond package is spent to actually pay for the school.
[01:15:25.061 --> 01:15:26.902]  All of it is immediately invested.
[01:15:29.159 --> 01:15:40.270]  And how this works is city managers go to mafia guilds, it's a few key universities, and they're sent there and it's their job to be a city manager in a small city.
[01:15:40.570 --> 01:15:45.055]  Then they go into private business as their payoff with the companies they made investments with.
[01:15:45.435 --> 01:15:51.501]  Ten years later, they go back into a bigger city, then go back out and make even more money, and that's the payoff.
[01:15:53.579 --> 01:15:55.860]  It's just an absolute total scam.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:18.130]  So we've got all these real examples, all these real examples of government corruption and double sets of books and all this money that has been stolen and it's all publicly available in your face.
[01:16:19.171 --> 01:16:21.492]  Just like all the admissions of concentration camps.
[01:16:22.154 --> 01:16:25.875]  Official Civilian Inmate Labor Program, declassified in 96.
[01:16:28.096 --> 01:16:29.116]  Army.mil.
[01:16:29.676 --> 01:16:31.457]  No one wants to go there and actually read it.
[01:16:32.977 --> 01:16:39.019]  No, we'll talk about, my cousin's brother knew a kid who saw shackles in a train.
[01:16:39.039 --> 01:16:42.100]  Okay.
[01:16:44.781 --> 01:16:46.182]  And it is the same thing.
[01:16:46.302 --> 01:16:50.283]  I mean, if... I just... I have nothing to say.
[01:16:52.106 --> 01:16:58.110]  About the people that put out reports that, you know, it's always the same.
[01:16:59.911 --> 01:17:11.778]  The French Secret Service had a shootout in the subway of Chicago and stopped the Catholic Zionists from blowing up the Sears Tower.
[01:17:12.539 --> 01:17:21.444]  Or, a nuke was going to go off in Houston, but there was a military revolt and they stopped it.
[01:17:24.592 --> 01:17:31.194]  On, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and on.
[01:17:31.754 --> 01:17:34.094]  And it's always the same three or four sources.
[01:17:34.794 --> 01:17:36.555]  It's always the same three or four groups.
[01:17:37.135 --> 01:17:38.455]  The same three or four people.
[01:17:39.915 --> 01:17:42.796]  And it's just unbelievable.
[01:17:42.816 --> 01:17:45.557]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:50.038]  But I mean, the world is a dirty business.
[01:17:50.078 --> 01:17:51.538]  The things that happen in the world.
[01:17:52.786 --> 01:17:54.028]  Let me explain something.
[01:17:54.068 --> 01:18:02.036]  Just because the mainstream media lies, and just because the government's corrupt and bad, that doesn't then mean automatically everything on the alternative is true.
[01:18:04.578 --> 01:18:13.367]  No, the alternative media in many ways, in many respects, more closely resembles the mainstream media.
[01:18:17.282 --> 01:18:18.242]  And it's the same thing.
[01:18:18.282 --> 01:18:20.903]  A lot of it's egos, a lot of it's craziness.
[01:18:21.563 --> 01:18:28.846]  Also, some people go out and they put out a ridiculous baloney story, and they get attention at first, and they think, oh man, this is great, I'll just make more stuff up.
[01:18:30.046 --> 01:18:40.109]  And they do it over and over and over again, and then finally, they have absolutely no credibility, and nobody visits their websites, and nobody respects them or supports them, and they have no effect.
[01:18:44.251 --> 01:18:44.791]  And, uh,
[01:18:48.473 --> 01:18:50.774]  I mean, I don't know what you want me to say here.
[01:18:52.415 --> 01:18:55.015]  But I am not in a good mood today, as you can probably tell.
[01:18:55.896 --> 01:18:58.637]  And I'm apt to just strike out.
[01:18:58.857 --> 01:19:01.758]  Because a lot of times, I bite my tongue, folks.
[01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:07.800]  I mean, I love to talk about some of the jokers we've got here locally in Austin, Texas.
[01:19:09.961 --> 01:19:12.482]  But overall, it's not healthy to do.
[01:19:14.003 --> 01:19:14.823]  So I don't do it.
[01:19:17.284 --> 01:19:17.864]  I don't do it.
[01:19:19.375 --> 01:19:21.536]  But if they can just give me an excuse, I will.
[01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:23.257]  I mean, I'm so close.
[01:19:24.738 --> 01:19:29.701]  Because, uh... It's just incredible.
[01:19:31.982 --> 01:19:33.843]  It's absolutely incredible.
[01:19:35.484 --> 01:19:37.065]  The thing is, people don't respect me.
[01:19:38.066 --> 01:19:40.307]  They think I just fell off a turnip truck or something.
[01:19:41.748 --> 01:19:48.652]  You know, I get up here, and I talk about real issues, real things that are happening.
[01:19:49.449 --> 01:19:50.810]  And a lot of people can't deal with it.
[01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:52.110]  Verifiable stuff.
[01:19:53.771 --> 01:19:54.311]  Certified.
[01:19:54.831 --> 01:19:55.211]  Admitted.
[01:19:55.811 --> 01:19:56.291]  In the open.
[01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:58.012]  That's really what I do.
[01:19:58.052 --> 01:19:59.312]  I mean, I collect information.
[01:19:59.352 --> 01:20:00.353]  I collect what's admitted.
[01:20:00.953 --> 01:20:05.054]  I take things that are hidden in plain view and try to expand on them.
[01:20:06.615 --> 01:20:07.355]  That's what I do.
[01:20:11.097 --> 01:20:14.798]  And, uh, I got a short fuse, folks.
[01:20:17.019 --> 01:20:18.059]  We need to clean house.
[01:20:21.027 --> 01:20:22.608]  Who knows, maybe I'll clean house today.
[01:20:23.529 --> 01:20:26.512]  Let me start writing some notes of the things I want to talk about.
[01:20:33.089 --> 01:20:37.670]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[01:21:33.296 --> 01:21:35.798]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:36.459 --> 01:21:45.045]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:50.970]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[01:21:52.031 --> 01:21:53.872]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:54.252 --> 01:21:55.033]  There may be more.
[01:21:56.215 --> 01:22:02.998]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:22:03.698 --> 01:22:11.521]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:13.942]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:14.282]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:24.130 --> 01:22:24.550]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6.
[01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:27.030]  Call now.
[01:22:27.051 --> 01:22:29.951]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[01:22:32.872 --> 01:22:33.912]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:22:33.952 --> 01:22:34.433]  January 2007.
[01:22:34.473 --> 01:22:34.713]  Gold.
[01:22:34.733 --> 01:22:34.773]  6-0-8.
[01:22:34.853 --> 01:22:36.813]  Ounce gold coins are at 6-28-32, 3-16-71 for half, 1-58-35 for quarter ounce.
[01:22:36.853 --> 01:22:37.373]  That's 6-28-32, 3-16-71, and 1-58-35.
[01:22:37.393 --> 01:22:37.373]  1971.
[01:22:37.414 --> 01:22:38.234]  Nixon closes the gold window.
[01:22:49.537 --> 01:23:13.314]  Fiat currency 1920s the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion 1995 gold doubles against the Mexican peso 1997 gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee 1998 gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble 2002 the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold 2006 the last superpower the USA's mighty dollar loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:23:13.474 --> 01:23:14.795]  Could government let this happen?
[01:23:14.936 --> 01:23:16.917]  Without immediate backing how much will it lose?
[01:23:17.177 --> 01:23:24.326]  Midas has Nick Bereshef's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:23:24.366 --> 01:23:26.148]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:23:26.188 --> 01:23:27.490]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.710]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:33.166 --> 01:23:37.747]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:23:38.147 --> 01:23:41.068]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:23:41.388 --> 01:23:43.968]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:23:44.328 --> 01:23:49.149]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:23:49.529 --> 01:23:54.890]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:23:55.190 --> 01:23:58.151]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:23:58.351 --> 01:23:59.511]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:24:00.992 --> 01:24:05.713]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[01:24:05.913 --> 01:24:10.055]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:24:10.355 --> 01:24:16.637]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[01:24:16.977 --> 01:24:18.597]  It says, worship the beast.
[01:24:18.877 --> 01:24:21.478]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:24:21.758 --> 01:24:26.939]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:24:26.959 --> 01:24:27.300]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:30.841]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side
[01:24:51.969 --> 01:24:55.231]  Many a young man lost her marbles to my trade.
[01:24:57.873 --> 01:25:01.135]  Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade.
[01:25:03.637 --> 01:25:07.379]  The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.962]  But I am still alive.
[01:25:12.022 --> 01:25:16.865]  I was a sailor.
[01:25:17.246 --> 01:25:20.348]  I was born upon the tide.
[01:25:22.714 --> 01:25:27.075]  With the sea I did abide.
[01:25:27.296 --> 01:25:32.157]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[01:25:33.357 --> 01:25:39.319]  I went aloft and furled a mainsail in a float.
[01:25:39.339 --> 01:25:43.461]  And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed.
[01:25:44.701 --> 01:25:46.382]  But I'm living still.
[01:25:51.184 --> 01:25:53.946]  Alright, let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:25:54.066 --> 01:25:59.849]  I'm going to get into the fake terror alerts, massive mind control.
[01:25:59.949 --> 01:26:04.372]  That's what's going on right now.
[01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:09.135]  Don in Oklahoma, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:26:09.155 --> 01:26:09.435]  Welcome.
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:28.504]  Uh, yeah, Alex, and, uh, uh, Happy New Year, and I hope your family had a Happy New Year, or, and, and Christmas, and all that, and, uh, or the best you could.
[01:26:28.704 --> 01:26:31.666]  Well, it's, um, I hope you're having a great New Year, but do me a big favor.
[01:26:31.706 --> 01:26:32.646]  Turn your computer off.
[01:26:36.008 --> 01:26:36.728]  Off or down?
[01:26:37.628 --> 01:26:39.069]  You really, it's hard to hear you.
[01:26:39.129 --> 01:26:40.750]  I'd like to be able to hear what you have to say.
[01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:42.090]  Okay, let me, let me shut her down.
[01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:42.751]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.411 --> 01:26:44.011]  That'd be good.
[01:26:45.412 --> 01:26:45.972]  Sorry.
[01:26:45.992 --> 01:26:46.932]  That's very clear now.
[01:26:46.992 --> 01:26:47.653]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:26:47.873 --> 01:26:48.173]  Okay.
[01:26:49.328 --> 01:26:50.849]  Uh, you say it.
[01:26:50.869 --> 01:27:01.857]  A while ago I said many people, uh, not respect you, but you are a talker about a man that, uh, does respect you 100%.
[01:27:02.097 --> 01:27:07.121]  Everything you have written about, you have proven, and it's a fact.
[01:27:08.162 --> 01:27:09.703]  Everything you say is a fact.
[01:27:10.163 --> 01:27:14.466]  A lot of what I say, I'm not perfect, but we have a good track record is the point.
[01:27:14.706 --> 01:27:15.567]  You sure do.
[01:27:17.594 --> 01:27:22.636]  There's one thing I want to know is where is the fighting going on down on the border in Texas?
[01:27:23.536 --> 01:27:26.517]  I'm sure those ranchers are shooting back, surely.
[01:27:28.078 --> 01:27:32.180]  I'd like to be there to help as much as I can.
[01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:34.841]  There's been all sorts of fighting.
[01:27:36.681 --> 01:27:39.664]  A lot of people killed, a lot of people kidnapped, all sorts of murders.
[01:27:39.724 --> 01:27:40.805]  It's just kept real quiet.
[01:27:41.325 --> 01:27:47.590]  Basically, in the Wave of Laredo, you know, ten years ago, five years ago, there was a massive tourist site.
[01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:49.111]  Now the hotels are shutting down.
[01:27:49.151 --> 01:27:53.535]  There's no tourism to speak of because it's so dangerous.
[01:27:54.075 --> 01:27:58.039]  And the State Department put out a report saying it's more dangerous than the West Bank of Israel.
[01:27:58.819 --> 01:28:01.842]  And just last week, they fired at National Guard and overran them.
[01:28:02.732 --> 01:28:09.893]  And every few months we hear about whole neighborhoods being burned down in New Mexico and Arizona by the illegals.
[01:28:10.433 --> 01:28:11.354]  I mean, it's war.
[01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:12.554]  They are waging war.
[01:28:13.234 --> 01:28:17.995]  And yeah, the reports are there have been people shot and killed coming across on both sides.
[01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:22.576]  And it's just total bedlam, but the media keeps it real quiet.
[01:28:22.956 --> 01:28:25.796]  Well, we need to go to somebody.
[01:28:26.796 --> 01:28:28.837]  People like me, I'm 100% American.
[01:28:30.598 --> 01:28:38.864]  They're attacking the United States, and the military may not have no rounds in their weapons, but we do.
[01:28:39.024 --> 01:28:39.824]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:28:39.844 --> 01:28:48.570]  Illegals can run around wild everywhere, but they're looking for people driving around in Broncos with rifles who are down there trying to defend America.
[01:28:48.671 --> 01:28:51.913]  You are basically a terrorist when you try to defend the country.
[01:28:52.633 --> 01:29:02.198]  Uh, they do set-ups where illegals attack you, and then if you do anything back, they've got the ADL there, the Southern Poverty Law Center, to take whoever's ranch you were on.
[01:29:02.218 --> 01:29:03.499]  I mean, it's bad.
[01:29:03.579 --> 01:29:04.860]  Listen, they're doing everything.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:09.242]  I mean, it's just like they give illegals, uh, you know, free, uh,
[01:29:10.723 --> 01:29:17.108]  Bank accounts, and they give them better tuition costs than American citizens, and they do all of that.
[01:29:18.068 --> 01:29:21.871]  They give them home loans with no IDs.
[01:29:23.092 --> 01:29:25.173]  Again, it's not even the illegals who are bad people.
[01:29:25.573 --> 01:29:30.577]  It's that this system is using them to break down the country, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:29:30.957 --> 01:29:31.958]  And look, I understand.
[01:29:32.018 --> 01:29:33.459]  I've been down to the border a few times.
[01:29:33.899 --> 01:29:35.420]  I haven't been down there in a couple years.
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.361]  I need to go down there.
[01:29:37.248 --> 01:29:43.330]  Frankly, to shoot some footage for a film I'm working on right now, but at a certain point I've got to quit shooting and start editing.
[01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:46.051]  I just got an interview with Aaron Russo this weekend.
[01:29:47.811 --> 01:29:48.972]  Went out of town to get that.
[01:29:49.832 --> 01:29:52.613]  On Friday night, got back Saturday night.
[01:29:53.533 --> 01:29:54.613]  Got a great interview with him.
[01:29:54.633 --> 01:29:58.915]  Alright, we're going to come back and I'm going to go to Roger and Jen.
[01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:02.156]  If you've been holding the longest, and I'm going to get into the fake.
[01:30:03.696 --> 01:30:05.937]  Well, I don't know if this
[01:30:07.495 --> 01:30:09.156]  That is a fake drill.
[01:30:10.357 --> 01:30:12.418]  That is a fake attack that they say is a drill.
[01:30:12.818 --> 01:30:14.499]  But we know some of the past work.
[01:30:15.060 --> 01:30:17.701]  So we'll break down this form of control.
[01:30:23.065 --> 01:30:24.005]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.466 --> 01:30:26.067]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.987 --> 01:30:29.669]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:34.591 --> 01:30:35.411]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:35.631 --> 01:30:37.492]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[01:30:37.692 --> 01:30:40.873]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house.
[01:30:41.213 --> 01:30:41.773]  What did you do?
[01:30:41.873 --> 01:30:42.693]  Rob Bill Gates?
[01:30:42.793 --> 01:30:43.533]  No, John.
[01:30:43.613 --> 01:30:44.774]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:30:45.074 --> 01:30:50.615]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:30:50.935 --> 01:30:57.236]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:30:57.576 --> 01:30:59.777]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:00.077 --> 01:31:03.540]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[01:31:03.780 --> 01:31:04.160]  Whoa.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.761]  What was that website again?
[01:31:05.781 --> 01:31:09.404]  It's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:09.724 --> 01:31:10.845]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:15.328]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:15.469 --> 01:31:16.049]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:16.329 --> 01:31:17.530]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.611]  Check, please.
[01:31:20.397 --> 01:31:21.899]  Uh, you got this one, right Bill?
[01:31:22.379 --> 01:31:22.959]  Sure, John!
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.583]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:27.883 --> 01:31:29.605]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch!
[01:31:29.765 --> 01:31:30.105]  Deal!
[01:31:32.467 --> 01:31:34.069]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[01:31:34.389 --> 01:31:42.976]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[01:31:43.336 --> 01:31:49.061]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[01:31:49.461 --> 01:31:56.907]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[01:31:57.227 --> 01:32:02.571]  Davis Products is offering high-quality, solid-cast aluminum memorial markers for your American flag.
[01:32:02.872 --> 01:32:06.795]  Each memorial marker is specifically designed to represent one of 15 wars.
[01:32:07.115 --> 01:32:13.320]  All markers include a three-eighths inch pointed and threaded aluminum rod, painted and highlighted for an appearance that is unforgettable.
[01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:16.342]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?
[01:32:16.642 --> 01:32:16.963]  That's right.
[01:32:32.745 --> 01:32:33.626]  It's no secret.
[01:32:33.866 --> 01:32:39.370]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:44.353]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:32:44.633 --> 01:32:46.955]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:32:47.135 --> 01:32:49.736]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[01:32:49.977 --> 01:32:58.142]  Novo eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:32:58.322 --> 01:33:02.505]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novo.
[01:33:02.845 --> 01:33:09.050]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[01:33:09.231 --> 01:33:13.394]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[01:33:13.574 --> 01:33:17.918]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[01:33:18.098 --> 01:33:22.061]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[01:33:22.422 --> 01:33:24.944]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[01:33:25.084 --> 01:33:27.906]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[01:33:40.063 --> 01:33:42.884]  Roger, Linda, Rick, many others that are holding the toll-free number to join us.
[01:33:42.905 --> 01:33:43.965]  Wide open phones today is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:43.985 --> 01:33:44.065]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:45.306]  I'll tell you what, let me just do this.
[01:33:45.346 --> 01:33:47.467]  Let me go over what's happening here in Austin first.
[01:33:47.487 --> 01:33:49.788]  Let me just give you some background.
[01:34:10.217 --> 01:34:23.065]  In 2000, it's about seven o'clock at night, the phones start ringing at my house, there's been a nuclear spill in Kyle on I-35.
[01:34:23.085 --> 01:34:26.667]  Any Austronaut who lived here in 2000, you remember it.
[01:34:27.488 --> 01:34:34.492]  You turn on the radio, you turn on TV, the Army's been called out, total hysteria, highly radioactive, nuke spill,
[01:34:36.768 --> 01:34:37.989]  We live in South Austin.
[01:34:38.589 --> 01:34:43.470]  My wife, then my girlfriend, is going, you know, are we safe?
[01:34:45.070 --> 01:34:46.191]  What do we need to do?
[01:34:48.931 --> 01:34:50.652]  We're talking about getting out of the city.
[01:34:52.152 --> 01:34:54.333]  And I said, no.
[01:34:54.473 --> 01:34:55.633]  And I called Mike Hanson.
[01:34:55.673 --> 01:34:56.793]  He drove over to my house.
[01:34:58.094 --> 01:34:59.034]  He got in the car.
[01:34:59.114 --> 01:35:00.654]  We drove over.
[01:35:00.794 --> 01:35:01.795]  I-35 was shut down.
[01:35:01.835 --> 01:35:02.715]  We drove around it.
[01:35:04.342 --> 01:35:31.785]  and as we are and it took us two hours since about seven he gets over there about seven thirty we get about two hours about ten o'clock at night by the time we got up to where the spill was and what was it it was army troops and state police and local police a big multi-jurisdictional task force conflagration looked like a
[01:35:33.581 --> 01:36:00.289]  paramilitary convention and nothing's going on and then all right as we get up to it I mean hours in traffic to because they have a highway shut down I-35 shut down for hours and we get over there and guess what comes over local KLBJ radio and then it was on the local TV
[01:36:01.432 --> 01:36:10.077]  Oh, it was just a drill, but the Military Hazardous Materials Teams wanted us to know what it might be like.
[01:36:13.499 --> 01:36:19.302]  Then about two months later, it's the middle of the day and they shut down about a third of downtown Austin.
[01:36:20.863 --> 01:36:25.246]  Mike Hanson goes out there
[01:36:26.400 --> 01:36:30.282]  And he shoots video of this high and tight guy.
[01:36:30.582 --> 01:36:31.603]  High and tight haircut.
[01:36:33.383 --> 01:36:35.084]  He's got a little bit tan skin.
[01:36:37.065 --> 01:36:41.507]  Mike even got video of how he had a crayon in his back window of his car.
[01:36:41.948 --> 01:36:43.849]  He's under a overpass.
[01:36:44.889 --> 01:36:45.409]  Downtown.
[01:36:47.010 --> 01:36:52.193]  And the two cops that supposedly searched his car, when one of them opened the back of the car, he got sick.
[01:36:53.393 --> 01:36:54.854]  And had to go to the hospital.
[01:36:56.815 --> 01:37:01.239]  And then it came out a week later that that had been part of some drill.
[01:37:04.321 --> 01:37:19.153]  Then, a few weeks later, and there is actually a clip of this in 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, we get a call, everybody's getting sick at the DPS office in North Austin, the head state police office for the whole states in North Austin.
[01:37:20.034 --> 01:37:25.699]  And we drive over there, and I jump in front of the live news cameras and tell everybody it's totally fake and it's staged.
[01:37:26.343 --> 01:37:29.745]  And all they had to do in a PSYOP test was claim they'd found some powder.
[01:37:30.966 --> 01:37:34.969]  And then they don't need to have actors.
[01:37:35.029 --> 01:37:40.412]  Man, these women just started falling down on the floor, and I'm sick, and... This is how weak-minded we are, folks.
[01:37:41.112 --> 01:37:42.813]  This is called suggestion.
[01:37:44.374 --> 01:37:46.236]  It's a psychological tactic.
[01:37:47.456 --> 01:37:48.917]  A psychological phenomenon.
[01:37:51.839 --> 01:37:53.080]  And let me explain something.
[01:37:54.827 --> 01:38:09.338]  In that case, because this is war, I called up ABC and I called up the state police and I said, I know this is fake, I know this is another drill, because they'd already admitted the last two were, but I didn't want to let them wait until midnight to announce it or a week later.
[01:38:09.718 --> 01:38:11.459]  You know, quietly, oh by the way, that was a drill.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.922]  I said, I know it's a drill and I'm going to go public.
[01:38:15.802 --> 01:38:20.506]  And so within hours they started announcing it was just a drill and that some people got scared and upset.
[01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:25.985]  I actually bluffed them into admitting it was a drill early.
[01:38:26.345 --> 01:38:28.347]  I mean, we're not playing games here, folks.
[01:38:28.567 --> 01:38:31.130]  I'm having to bluff the government into admitting things, okay?
[01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:32.551]  This is my life.
[01:38:32.911 --> 01:38:34.133]  And let me tell you, it's not fun.
[01:38:37.856 --> 01:38:39.798]  These people aren't playing games either.
[01:38:39.818 --> 01:38:40.859]  I hope you understand that.
[01:38:44.642 --> 01:38:47.345]  And I just thought of a bunch of other examples of where they've had these
[01:38:51.258 --> 01:38:52.619]  Remember Belton, Texas?
[01:38:52.639 --> 01:38:53.559]  We have video of that.
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:56.880]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:38:58.421 --> 01:39:01.762]  And the mayor just gets up and says, we've been attacked by terrorists.
[01:39:02.483 --> 01:39:04.644]  And outside, they blow up two cars.
[01:39:05.524 --> 01:39:08.085]  Now, they didn't tell anyone they were doing this drill.
[01:39:10.023 --> 01:39:11.744]  People in the town are running around scared.
[01:39:11.764 --> 01:39:13.526]  There's an HEB 300 yards away.
[01:39:13.866 --> 01:39:15.207]  I'm over in their parking lot.
[01:39:15.607 --> 01:39:17.409]  Later in the afternoon, I go, what do you think happened?
[01:39:17.549 --> 01:39:18.870]  Oh, some kind of terrorist thing.
[01:39:19.070 --> 01:39:21.051]  Because the public's really stupid, folks.
[01:39:21.351 --> 01:39:23.293]  They just hear there's some terrorist thing.
[01:39:24.409 --> 01:39:27.450]  Now, at the end of the drill, he said, oh, this has been a really good drill.
[01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:29.250]  They've got helicopters landing.
[01:39:29.570 --> 01:39:32.611]  They've got army out there with bomb robots.
[01:39:33.011 --> 01:39:35.131]  They march over and tell us, turn our cameras off.
[01:39:35.151 --> 01:39:37.052]  You're the ones that have videotaped us before.
[01:39:37.332 --> 01:39:43.253]  Yeah, when they're out there, again, they ran a checkpoint on I-35 on the day before Thanksgiving, 1998.
[01:39:45.013 --> 01:39:46.073]  We got this on tape.
[01:39:46.373 --> 01:39:48.234]  This is just the stuff we're getting, okay?
[01:39:49.574 --> 01:39:51.494]  This is how we knew they were going to launch real attacks.
[01:39:51.975 --> 01:39:53.855]  Their whole culture is going to be about this.
[01:39:55.402 --> 01:39:56.863]  So a lot of you have actually seen this.
[01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:09.407]  And uh... Lieutenant Best of Belton walks over to Mike Hanson again and says, turn your camera off.
[01:40:12.688 --> 01:40:14.489]  Turn your camera off.
[01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:16.769]  And Mike says, no.
[01:40:17.650 --> 01:40:20.691]  And there's regular army running around covering up their faces.
[01:40:21.291 --> 01:40:23.032]  And we later interviewed the people on the bus.
[01:40:23.052 --> 01:40:24.012]  We found out what happened.
[01:40:24.657 --> 01:40:30.862]  They told them it was a real terrorist search, and they told them that they had word that there were bombs on the bus.
[01:40:32.002 --> 01:40:33.684]  And by the way, this was on the news that day.
[01:40:34.064 --> 01:40:35.024]  Might have been bombs.
[01:40:35.365 --> 01:40:49.815]  Turned out it was totally rigged with Greyhound, totally rigged with the company, the whole thing was a setup, and they kept those people there for eight hours, while three different teams did a drill, practicing going over the vehicle.
[01:40:50.828 --> 01:40:58.229]  Boy, you better not pull me over for some eight-hour drill and you lying crooks, and then sit there and tell everybody it's real.
[01:41:00.230 --> 01:41:08.111]  Now see, the more I sit here talking about this, I'll start remembering more and more of the things I've witnessed, the things I've seen.
[01:41:09.051 --> 01:41:14.332]  And man, I don't have to read about the hundreds of cases around the country where they've done the exact same thing or worse.
[01:41:14.852 --> 01:41:15.412]  I live it!
[01:41:15.952 --> 01:41:20.193]  I can go up to a FEMA camp for families north of me, 20 miles north of me.
[01:41:22.063 --> 01:41:25.565]  I can go down the street and show you microphones on the cameras put in in 98.
[01:41:27.807 --> 01:41:28.487]  We've been here.
[01:41:28.527 --> 01:41:29.588]  We've been at the checkpoints.
[01:41:29.628 --> 01:41:31.409]  We've been here at the fake nuclear spills.
[01:41:31.729 --> 01:41:33.511]  Hey man, we're living it, okay?
[01:41:35.892 --> 01:41:36.533]  We're living it.
[01:41:36.913 --> 01:41:41.916]  We're living losses at this terrorist gangs of Mexican troops assassinating people right here in Austin.
[01:41:42.717 --> 01:41:43.357]  We're living it.
[01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:44.538]  We're living the dream, baby.
[01:41:48.035 --> 01:41:59.583]  I mean, what has gotten into somebody in the Army's brain that they think they can walk up to us in downtown Belton, walk up to me, and tell me to shut my camera off?
[01:42:01.965 --> 01:42:03.807]  We told them, we're not shutting anything off!
[01:42:06.549 --> 01:42:08.250]  Well, you're the ones that filmed us before!
[01:42:08.730 --> 01:42:10.692]  That's right, we're the ones that filmed you before!
[01:42:10.892 --> 01:42:15.295]  And we'll keep filming you when you're out terrorizing people, anytime we feel like it!
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.941]  And there's nothing you can do about it because we don't care what you do to us!
[01:42:22.221 --> 01:42:23.041]  I don't care!
[01:42:27.223 --> 01:42:27.803]  You understand?
[01:42:27.863 --> 01:42:28.823]  I'm sick of it!
[01:42:29.123 --> 01:42:30.004]  I'm tired of it!
[01:42:30.224 --> 01:42:31.404]  I'm tired of your scams!
[01:42:31.464 --> 01:42:32.264]  I'm tired of it!
[01:42:34.265 --> 01:42:37.446]  Your boss has killed 3,000 people on 9-11!
[01:42:37.626 --> 01:42:38.826]  I'm pretty mad about it!
[01:42:43.428 --> 01:42:47.049]  And I'm tired of having to watch killers on TV pose as our saviors.
[01:42:48.183 --> 01:42:48.823]  I'm digressing.
[01:42:48.843 --> 01:42:58.605]  Remember in the late 90's every federal building in the country, and by that's a figure of speech, I mean it was hundreds of reports.
[01:42:59.645 --> 01:43:03.306]  They were always getting yellow or white powder that would say anthrax on it.
[01:43:04.206 --> 01:43:08.687]  And not in every case, but in quite a few would come out later, oh that was a drill testing readiness.
[01:43:09.067 --> 01:43:11.888]  They terrorize all those weak minded chicken brains.
[01:43:14.938 --> 01:43:17.620]  You ever seen how a chicken, when it's scared, runs around bouncing into things?
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.241]  Well, that's what they are, a bunch of chicken brains.
[01:43:19.662 --> 01:43:21.043]  Little stupid chicken brains.
[01:43:21.083 --> 01:43:22.924]  Again, they were mind-controlling them.
[01:43:23.124 --> 01:43:25.026]  They were re-educating them for fear.
[01:43:25.846 --> 01:43:31.811]  Because there's no real terror threat, but you've got to get them all scared to circle the wagons, so they'll be more against the people.
[01:43:34.313 --> 01:43:41.538]  And so the feds send around all over the country this powder, so the chicken brains will run around bumping into each other.
[01:43:45.020 --> 01:43:46.800]  So the chicken brains will live in fear.
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:50.581]  And they do the same thing here at everybody in Austin, a bunch of chicken brains.
[01:43:51.461 --> 01:43:54.402]  Well, they have fake nuclear spills, and hell, it scared me and my woman!
[01:43:56.082 --> 01:43:57.643]  Very dangerous nuclear spill.
[01:43:57.783 --> 01:43:59.123]  Austin may have to be evacuated.
[01:43:59.943 --> 01:44:00.703]  I-35 shut down.
[01:44:01.224 --> 01:44:07.905]  But I said, we gotta go cover this, because they say the Army's gonna be out there, and I smell a big, fat, gigantic, stinking rat.
[01:44:08.585 --> 01:44:12.346]  And there was a big, fat, gigantic, stinking rat when we got to the end of it.
[01:44:13.323 --> 01:44:19.885]  And you know, if you or I announced there was a nuclear spill, boy, we'd be clapped in irons so fast and we'd be under the jail when we should be.
[01:44:20.445 --> 01:44:22.165]  That's yelling fire in a theater, baby.
[01:44:25.106 --> 01:44:27.207]  But they do it, and it's cute.
[01:44:27.747 --> 01:44:34.509]  Oh, well, we want to... And they said we want to get you ready for this type of thing and test our response.
[01:44:35.675 --> 01:44:37.395]  Because they live by different rules.
[01:44:37.795 --> 01:44:40.576]  And of course, the fools, it's their whole job.
[01:44:40.616 --> 01:44:48.178]  Imagine these people, these hazmat teams, sitting around, no real job, no real threat, there's never going to be a bio-attack, there's never going to be anything real happen.
[01:44:48.738 --> 01:44:50.298]  Statistically, it's never going to happen.
[01:44:50.478 --> 01:44:52.198]  By never, it'll never happen in their area.
[01:44:52.238 --> 01:44:54.799]  It might happen once every ten years somewhere else.
[01:44:56.139 --> 01:45:04.101]  But they're going to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on this, they already have, and so there's got to be at least the perception that this is going on.
[01:45:05.954 --> 01:45:09.075]  And so coast-to-coast, border-to-border, they have drills everywhere.
[01:45:09.355 --> 01:45:15.718]  I mean, they blew up some cars in Belton to terrorize the population, and we went and caught on tape.
[01:45:16.218 --> 01:45:22.720]  I remember up in Seattle three years ago when they blew up a bunch of buses and trains, and I saw it on the news.
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:25.061]  It was like the surface of a war ground.
[01:45:25.081 --> 01:45:28.182]  It looked like Berlin being invaded by the Soviets.
[01:45:30.516 --> 01:45:41.666]  I mean, it's like 15 blackened buses and fires shooting out and blown up trains and troops and guys in hazmat gear and smoke billowing out of the city of Seattle.
[01:45:41.906 --> 01:45:44.769]  They did some big thing in Chicago, burning vehicles.
[01:45:45.810 --> 01:45:49.834]  If I had the money, the staff, the crew, we'd be at all these events showing you this.
[01:45:49.874 --> 01:45:50.975]  And what do these drills do?
[01:45:51.055 --> 01:45:54.558]  They train you to the perception.
[01:45:56.161 --> 01:46:01.768]  The average person sees those burning trucks and sees those events as real.
[01:46:02.249 --> 01:46:07.135]  At the subconscious level, the brain is going, man, that's scary, because it is real burning vehicles.
[01:46:07.575 --> 01:46:08.577]  It is real troops.
[01:46:08.637 --> 01:46:11.120]  It is real people in hazmat suits.
[01:46:12.261 --> 01:46:15.145]  And all the children nationally see that.
[01:46:16.408 --> 01:46:22.972]  And then the children in the town see it, but they look out their back windows at school, and they get to see the smoke rising.
[01:46:23.433 --> 01:46:25.794]  They get to see army helicopters flying around.
[01:46:26.355 --> 01:46:27.756]  All meant to train them!
[01:46:28.876 --> 01:46:29.257]  You see?
[01:46:30.177 --> 01:46:32.399]  It's the exact same thing with terrorizing children.
[01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:34.480]  We need to write a story on this, integrate all this together.
[01:46:35.461 --> 01:46:42.465]  From coast to coast, border to border, there are federal grants where 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 year olds, I mean they do it to elementary students,
[01:46:44.369 --> 01:46:48.051]  Are sitting there and all of a sudden the door is literally kicked open.
[01:46:49.792 --> 01:46:53.074]  In some cases the cops get so out of control they actually knock doors off hinges.
[01:46:53.815 --> 01:46:55.216]  This would intimidate a full grown man.
[01:46:55.236 --> 01:46:57.997]  I mean if I was sitting there and the door suddenly kicked open I'd have an adrenaline rush.
[01:46:58.998 --> 01:47:03.881]  And it was a guy with a black ski mask and there might even be a little squirt involved, you know?
[01:47:04.947 --> 01:47:07.468]  All that is, is your body getting jazzed up and ready for something.
[01:47:07.628 --> 01:47:20.635]  Can you imagine some seven-year-old guys running, screaming with black helmets and masks, pointing guns at kids, and the kids are pooping themselves, peeing on themselves, and they drag them out to the hallways, and it goes on for two hours, and kids are collapsing, freaking out?
[01:47:20.655 --> 01:47:26.137]  I mean, that is serious, hardcore abuse!
[01:47:26.998 --> 01:47:31.560]  And the police chief gets up and goes, well, we got a federal grant, and I call up the principal,
[01:47:32.555 --> 01:47:36.638]  And he's all, yeah, I'm a former colonel, what do you got a problem with our police?
[01:47:37.019 --> 01:47:39.481]  This is how we get our children ready for the real world.
[01:47:39.581 --> 01:47:40.521]  I think it's good.
[01:47:40.541 --> 01:47:48.387]  I mean, these people, man, their brains, their souls, their common sense, took a vacation and never came back a long time ago.
[01:47:51.730 --> 01:47:58.195]  Feds have drills where they throw fake blood on the kids, and I got video of this, and tell them homeschoolers are coming to kill them.
[01:47:59.036 --> 01:48:00.437]  That's called mind control, folks.
[01:48:01.343 --> 01:48:02.444]  And they do it everywhere.
[01:48:03.524 --> 01:48:12.388]  And so it's gotten to the point with the mind control that Austin cops see a couple dead pigeons, man, they start total fear and cops start collapsing.
[01:48:12.788 --> 01:48:17.331]  And this may be stage two, they just got to just tell the media one or two cops didn't feel well.
[01:48:18.431 --> 01:48:20.332]  Because cops have staged this in the past here.
[01:48:21.738 --> 01:48:23.018]  I don't know if this one's staged.
[01:48:23.358 --> 01:48:24.119]  Probably isn't.
[01:48:24.479 --> 01:48:30.440]  Once you stage it a few times, then other people start buying into the mass hypnosis.
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:32.940]  They start buying into the suggestion.
[01:48:34.561 --> 01:48:40.162]  And, uh, one report says two cops, one says three, one had to be helped, two an ambulance.
[01:48:40.622 --> 01:48:42.002]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:48:43.082 --> 01:48:50.324]  Somebody poisoned pigeons, and now they shut down part of downtown for, I don't know, 3 a.m.
[01:48:50.344 --> 01:48:50.724]  to noon?
[01:48:50.744 --> 01:48:51.364]  How long is that?
[01:48:52.859 --> 01:48:54.219]  And there's all this fear.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:49:00.521]  And that shows us land of the cowardly, pathetic, jump-at-their-own-shadow Americans.
[01:49:01.641 --> 01:49:17.625]  But hell, it's ten years of fake anthrax letters and real anthrax letters, which the Feds did as well, and fake bio-attacks and all of this stuff, to continue the illusion that there's this real threat looming on the horizon any moment.
[01:49:21.900 --> 01:49:28.284]  To wear some dead pigeons causes a whole city to be gripped in fear and people keeping their children home from school.
[01:49:32.567 --> 01:49:34.669]  This is a journey into slavery!
[01:49:36.890 --> 01:49:41.434]  Now Paul Watson wrote a story last week about how you got a better chance of being struck by lightning than dying by terror.
[01:49:41.954 --> 01:49:43.855]  And that's even when you factor the 3,000 dead of a 9-11 in.
[01:49:43.895 --> 01:49:44.516]  You take that 3,000 out,
[01:49:48.451 --> 01:49:51.734]  It's numbers close to two lightning strikes.
[01:49:51.754 --> 01:49:54.075]  I mean, struck by lightning twice.
[01:49:56.157 --> 01:50:01.561]  I mean, you got six and a half billion people, and a couple hundred a year would die of terrorism previously.
[01:50:06.185 --> 01:50:11.109]  They love terrorism, though, because it's an undefinable enemy that can never be defeated.
[01:50:13.130 --> 01:50:14.571]  So, I've said my piece.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:22.001]  They had the 6th WMD Civil Support Team.
[01:50:23.441 --> 01:50:30.002]  The Texas National Guard unit created in 99 to respond to terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction.
[01:50:30.302 --> 01:50:38.104]  You read the actual documents, there's a group of regular army that assist in warrant service on a routine basis, but covertly out of military uniform.
[01:50:39.404 --> 01:50:42.945]  The FBI pulled up in the Temple thing with Lt.
[01:50:43.005 --> 01:50:43.785]  Vest that time.
[01:50:44.697 --> 01:50:51.282]  And the FBI agent gave an eyes-only document to Mike instead of the public one, like a moron.
[01:50:51.542 --> 01:50:53.004]  That's why we have it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:50:53.024 --> 01:50:54.925]  You can go read what they're really doing if you'd like.
[01:50:59.288 --> 01:51:00.990]  But this one's just off their website.
[01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:03.111]  This is linked in the Houston Chronicle article.
[01:51:03.992 --> 01:51:10.197]  About active duty soldiers, airmen, who maintain an alert posture 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:51:10.217 --> 01:51:11.518]  Yeah, they're out at Berkscom.
[01:51:15.729 --> 01:51:21.115]  They've got C-130 aircraft and helicopters, FBI, EPA, FEMA.
[01:51:21.535 --> 01:51:23.217]  They work with fire, police, EMS.
[01:51:24.878 --> 01:51:25.559]  Yeah, guys.
[01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.161]  What a joke.
[01:51:27.561 --> 01:51:30.164]  You got a sticky on the border if you wanted to do some real good.
[01:51:32.859 --> 01:51:38.681]  Hey ladies, if you love to shop, then visit HerbalHealer.com to browse through their online catalog.
[01:51:38.781 --> 01:51:44.243]  You'll find thousands of effective, alternative, and natural products for you and the whole family.

[01:51:51.826 --> 01:51:52.407]  I think so.
[01:52:10.026 --> 01:52:10.486]  I think so.
[01:52:35.715 --> 01:52:41.140]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:49.166]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:52:49.853 --> 01:52:56.899]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:52:57.299 --> 01:53:08.708]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:53:09.049 --> 01:53:12.551]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:53:13.012 --> 01:53:14.933]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:53:15.254 --> 01:53:19.097]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:32.552 --> 01:53:34.373]  Dad, can we stop?
[01:53:34.734 --> 01:53:36.255]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[01:53:36.675 --> 01:53:36.895]  What?
[01:53:37.275 --> 01:53:37.636]  Again?
[01:53:38.056 --> 01:53:39.677]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[01:53:39.737 --> 01:53:44.180]  Honey, let's stop, because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.701]  Why did you do that?
[01:53:45.901 --> 01:53:51.705]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time, and that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[01:53:51.986 --> 01:53:53.026]  Are we there yet?
[01:53:53.126 --> 01:53:54.207]  for the entire trip.
[01:53:54.447 --> 01:53:56.609]  Hmm, I didn't think about that.
[01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:58.131]  Great idea!
[01:53:58.411 --> 01:54:01.034]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids!
[01:54:01.334 --> 01:54:08.423]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle, and using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[01:54:08.703 --> 01:54:09.024]  Honey!
[01:54:09.835 --> 01:54:11.076]  You're terrific!
[01:54:11.476 --> 01:54:12.957]  Oh honey, so are you!
[01:54:13.077 --> 01:54:16.479]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[01:54:16.759 --> 01:54:17.540]  Now can we stop?
[01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:18.781]  I need to go too.
[01:54:19.081 --> 01:54:23.524]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:54:23.584 --> 01:54:25.485]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:54:36.170 --> 01:54:41.207]  Day after day, alone on a hill.
[01:54:42.907 --> 01:54:48.809]  The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
[01:54:49.029 --> 01:54:52.211]  But nobody wants to know him.
[01:54:52.591 --> 01:54:55.272]  They can see that he's just a fool.
[01:54:56.452 --> 01:54:58.793]  And he never gives an answer.
[01:54:59.153 --> 01:55:08.577]  But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down and the eyes in his head.
[01:55:13.122 --> 01:55:14.063]  All right, welcome back.
[01:55:16.565 --> 01:55:21.651]  We're going to go to Roger and Linda and Rick and Rob and everybody here in a moment.
[01:55:22.472 --> 01:55:30.821]  They had some type of gas leak or some stench, which the police are now saying wasn't even a gas leak, probably some big sewer leak or something.
[01:55:31.765 --> 01:55:34.946]  And everybody thought it was Al-Qaeda, was running around in fear and not going to work.
[01:55:35.006 --> 01:55:39.228]  And the government had to say, oh no, it's okay, it's not Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:40.388 --> 01:55:43.370]  See, just everything's Al-Qaeda now, because Jack Bauer says so.
[01:55:43.390 --> 01:55:50.953]  Because every major TV show that's a drama is about how you torture people and it's good, and secret police are good, and there's terrorists everywhere.
[01:55:51.233 --> 01:55:59.196]  But in the real world, our borders are wide open and they're giving the illegals amnesty, and major pizza chains in Texas are taking pesos now.
[01:56:00.339 --> 01:56:03.701]  Mexican troops are overrunning our troops who run in cowardly fear.
[01:56:03.721 --> 01:56:08.684]  This is the type of news I have in front of me.
[01:56:09.545 --> 01:56:12.627]  And Israel is saying, yeah, we may go ahead and nuke Iran.
[01:56:12.647 --> 01:56:13.748]  That's coming up in the next hour.
[01:56:14.088 --> 01:56:15.749]  And I want to talk about that in some detail.
[01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:27.897]  But I cannot stress how bad it is all over the country to have armed police running drills unannounced, terrorizing children.
[01:56:29.471 --> 01:56:31.552]  Where they put guns in their head and have them line up.
[01:56:31.652 --> 01:56:35.054]  That is trauma-based mind control, period.
[01:56:35.134 --> 01:56:36.155]  And is outrageous!
[01:56:37.095 --> 01:56:41.678]  It's as outrageous or more outrageous as cameras in the bathrooms.
[01:56:42.858 --> 01:56:45.320]  Remember the case in Tennessee where they had them in the girls' shower?
[01:56:45.720 --> 01:56:48.862]  And the away team came and ran out screaming and yelling.
[01:56:48.902 --> 01:56:49.782]  It was a big scene.
[01:56:50.102 --> 01:56:53.244]  And the police came and the principal said, what's the big deal?
[01:56:53.264 --> 01:56:54.925]  Of course we have cameras in the showers.
[01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:58.952]  Everywhere must be surveilled for your safety.
[01:56:59.512 --> 01:57:01.493]  See, at that school, everybody was normal!
[01:57:02.154 --> 01:57:03.475]  Because they were a bunch of freaks!
[01:57:03.915 --> 01:57:06.697]  But normal people still freaked out and screamed!
[01:57:08.118 --> 01:57:17.684]  I mean, imagine you're in a public shower, let's say at the gym, or back when you were in school at the field house, and you look up and there's a camera in the shower.
[01:57:18.732 --> 01:57:20.353]  You would not as a camera boy!
[01:57:20.373 --> 01:57:20.813]  Go on!
[01:57:21.033 --> 01:57:22.274]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:57:22.394 --> 01:57:26.015]  Not in certain areas where the brainwashing has been brought forward.
[01:57:26.055 --> 01:57:26.815]  It's normal.
[01:57:26.995 --> 01:57:30.517]  It's normal to have officers come in and terrorize your child with a gun to their head.
[01:57:30.957 --> 01:57:32.158]  It's for their safety.
[01:57:32.178 --> 01:57:37.840]  They'll kinda, I mean... I mean, Harrison Kleibold in 99.
[01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:41.821]  On April 20th, I mean, they're gonna kill our children.
[01:57:41.842 --> 01:57:43.782]  I mean, we've gotta do it!
[01:57:44.763 --> 01:57:45.223]  See how...
[01:57:46.411 --> 01:57:50.192]  Oh, but somebody might email me and say, you're making a big deal out of it.
[01:57:50.252 --> 01:57:52.312]  It's not that... It's a huge deal!
[01:57:53.352 --> 01:57:54.532]  What is wrong with you?
[01:57:54.893 --> 01:58:07.555]  Fake nuclear spills and fake terror attacks that they announce after the Factor drills, or they'll do it really sneaky on 60 Minutes, and have also seen it on Nightline.
[01:58:08.095 --> 01:58:10.775]  At the very start, they will say, this is a dramatization, blah, blah, blah.
[01:58:10.935 --> 01:58:13.756]  And then they just go into a whole 30-minute, hour-long news piece
[01:58:15.518 --> 01:58:16.319]  Nightline really did it.
[01:58:16.339 --> 01:58:22.760]  It was a five-night piece where the terrorists have hit and are destroying and the bioweapons spreading.
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.681]  And they would show real footage and wouldn't say it was fake until the end.
[01:58:26.701 --> 01:58:28.202]  And of course it created hysteria.
[01:58:28.462 --> 01:58:32.763]  They want to hit you and have that psychological effect that it's real.
[01:58:33.883 --> 01:58:36.584]  To the point of you're a bunch of ninnying creatures.
[01:58:37.004 --> 01:58:41.865]  Why do you think they have drills all over the country of Delta Force coming in and taking over city halls?
[01:58:42.947 --> 01:58:44.728]  They told Thomas Sanchez in Kingsville.
[01:58:45.448 --> 01:58:45.988]  I interviewed him.
[01:58:46.389 --> 01:58:47.529]  Emergency Management Chief.
[01:58:47.789 --> 01:58:49.910]  They told him this is for takeover of America.
[01:58:51.151 --> 01:58:53.852]  I don't need the inside documents to know that.
[01:58:53.892 --> 01:58:55.033]  Of course that's what it's for.
[01:58:56.794 --> 01:58:58.254]  It's to condition the public.
[01:58:58.995 --> 01:59:00.976]  And it's to train the military this is okay.
[01:59:01.016 --> 01:59:04.017]  Do you like being conditioned for total takeover, folks?
[01:59:04.497 --> 01:59:05.418]  Because it's happening.
[01:59:06.178 --> 01:59:07.719]  They're not playing games.
[01:59:08.159 --> 01:59:10.260]  And you should be hopping mad.
[01:59:13.050 --> 01:59:17.338]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:59:22.782 --> 01:59:27.866]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:59:27.946 --> 01:59:35.251]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:59:35.411 --> 01:59:46.019]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:59:46.239 --> 01:59:50.742]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:59:51.062 --> 01:59:54.805]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from all minerals.
[01:59:56.227 --> 02:00:06.095]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.

[02:00:22.125 --> 02:00:24.047]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:24.527 --> 02:00:27.309]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:33.837 --> 02:00:34.477]  Big Brother.
[02:00:35.138 --> 02:00:36.198]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:36.919 --> 02:00:38.019]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:38.679 --> 02:00:39.480]  You want answers?
[02:00:40.260 --> 02:00:41.200]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:41.801 --> 02:00:45.502]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:45.983 --> 02:00:50.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:55.807 --> 02:00:56.828]  Alright, third hour.
[02:00:57.448 --> 02:00:58.429]  Wide open phones.
[02:00:59.789 --> 02:01:01.390]  They're open discussions of Israel.
[02:01:02.512 --> 02:01:04.333]  Using nuclear weapons on Iran.
[02:01:04.894 --> 02:01:07.575]  We, of course, covered this a year ago, but now it's back in the news.
[02:01:08.216 --> 02:01:10.477]  Open discussions of going to war with Iran.
[02:01:12.479 --> 02:01:13.759]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[02:01:13.979 --> 02:01:15.921]  Roger in Key West, but holding patiently.
[02:01:16.221 --> 02:01:17.242]  You're on the air, Roger.
[02:01:17.282 --> 02:01:17.642]  Thank you.
[02:01:18.402 --> 02:01:18.903]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:19.223 --> 02:01:19.483]  Hi.
[02:01:21.324 --> 02:01:25.647]  Man, I'll tell you, I just started listening to you in the last few months.
[02:01:25.667 --> 02:01:31.631]  A friend of mine, she's a big fan of yours, and actually she's sending you some things on
[02:01:32.250 --> 02:01:36.551]  You know that owl that you witnessed in Bohemian Grove?
[02:01:38.172 --> 02:01:41.173]  Yes.
[02:01:42.653 --> 02:01:45.514]  It seems to be everywhere now that she's pointed it out.
[02:01:45.734 --> 02:01:50.876]  And that little Japanese doll, Kinkajou or Pinkajou or whatever it is.
[02:01:51.116 --> 02:01:52.136]  Pinkajou, yeah, whatever.
[02:01:52.156 --> 02:01:53.036]  Yeah, Pinkajou.
[02:01:53.696 --> 02:01:55.797]  She showed me that the other day in a similarity.
[02:01:55.837 --> 02:01:58.538]  She's got this whole collage she's emailing you, so you might
[02:01:59.950 --> 02:02:07.853]  Well, one of their symbols is the pyramid, the other is an all-seeing eye with a pyramid, triple sixes together, and the owl.
[02:02:08.354 --> 02:02:12.395]  The owl, of course, is Lilith and other things in mythology.
[02:02:13.116 --> 02:02:14.576]  Right, and it's on the dollar bill.
[02:02:14.696 --> 02:02:15.677]  It's everywhere.
[02:02:16.117 --> 02:02:18.158]  Yeah, so I was like, I was just blown away.
[02:02:18.258 --> 02:02:24.841]  I'm from Canada, but I've been living down here for a little over ten years, and I was very skeptical.
[02:02:24.961 --> 02:02:28.182]  She's been, you know, dogging me and all this stuff, and I finally started
[02:02:29.068 --> 02:02:29.929]  Looking at a few things.
[02:02:29.989 --> 02:02:32.810]  I watched 9-11 Mysteries, and I was just like, oh my God.
[02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:38.793]  Then Conspiracy of Silence, and it just started on and on.
[02:02:39.434 --> 02:02:46.037]  But I don't know if you... Have you read a book by Anatoly Fomenko called History, Fiction, or Science?
[02:02:46.698 --> 02:02:47.558]  No, but I've heard of it.
[02:02:48.359 --> 02:02:50.620]  Oh, man, you have to read that.
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:55.483]  You know, George Orwell said, who controls the past controls the future.
[02:02:55.583 --> 02:02:55.843]  Yes.
[02:02:56.303 --> 02:02:57.784]  The present controls the past.
[02:02:58.821 --> 02:03:01.422]  And, uh, this just makes a lot of sense.
[02:03:01.442 --> 02:03:04.882]  You read this book and I've always been a history buff.
[02:03:05.863 --> 02:03:21.026]  And, uh, you know, we always had questions on, you know, certain things that just didn't fit, especially when you go into medieval, um, before that from what they say is, you know, 1100 back to the birth of Christ.
[02:03:21.506 --> 02:03:25.907]  So, uh, too many, uh, open holes there.
[02:03:27.243 --> 02:03:28.744]  And that just raised a lot of questions.
[02:03:28.764 --> 02:03:31.005]  But when I read this book, I was just blown away.
[02:03:31.405 --> 02:03:32.286]  And he backs it up.
[02:03:32.306 --> 02:03:33.466]  This guy's a mathematician.
[02:03:33.486 --> 02:03:34.487]  He's not a historian.
[02:03:35.267 --> 02:03:46.513]  And he got into it with, you know, his evidence was based on, you know, eclipses and other astral events.
[02:03:46.913 --> 02:03:51.795]  And it just blows you away when you start... His evidence of what?
[02:03:54.055 --> 02:03:58.458]  He shows how the Catholic Church, you've heard of the Council of Trent?
[02:03:59.398 --> 02:03:59.698]  Yes.
[02:04:00.619 --> 02:04:07.082]  And he shows how all of our history is really based on this Scaliger.
[02:04:08.023 --> 02:04:13.886]  He was basically a scriber for the Catholic Church back in the 14-1500s.
[02:04:14.806 --> 02:04:22.991]  His father, coincidentally, was named Julius Caesar Scaliger, and so he wrote
[02:04:23.649 --> 02:04:27.550]  Basically everything, he fictionalized our history.
[02:04:29.610 --> 02:04:51.636]  And it all seemed to start from around 1259 when there was a huge volcanic explosion that caused most of the civilizations to go back centuries or millennia from starving, the crops and everything failing.
[02:04:53.504 --> 02:04:54.184]  Yeah, well you see, that's just it.
[02:04:54.204 --> 02:04:57.525]  If you start reading this book, the Roman Empire and everything kind of falls into the same time as...
[02:05:13.660 --> 02:05:15.402]  Listen, I really appreciate your call.
[02:05:15.442 --> 02:05:16.323]  I'll let them check into that.
[02:05:16.363 --> 02:05:17.104]  Thanks for the call.
[02:05:17.565 --> 02:05:21.830]  We'll be right back and we'll talk to Linda, Rick, Rob, and others.
[02:05:22.210 --> 02:05:25.755]  And I'm going to get into what's happening with the war drums for Iran.
[02:05:32.933 --> 02:05:38.377]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.738 --> 02:05:46.404]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:47.088 --> 02:05:54.150]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:54.531 --> 02:06:05.934]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:06.275 --> 02:06:09.776]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:10.236 --> 02:06:12.136]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:12.497 --> 02:06:16.338]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:29.620 --> 02:06:32.642]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:06:32.942 --> 02:06:37.884]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:06:38.125 --> 02:06:42.487]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:06:42.787 --> 02:06:51.692]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:06:51.912 --> 02:06:55.514]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:06:55.814 --> 02:07:00.839]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:07:01.140 --> 02:07:07.827]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:07:08.351 --> 02:07:08.992]  What about you?

[02:07:29.346 --> 02:07:34.128]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:07:34.348 --> 02:07:38.329]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[02:07:38.589 --> 02:07:44.871]  As you may have heard by now, Kenz Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[02:08:34.330 --> 02:08:34.991]  Big Brother.
[02:08:35.631 --> 02:08:36.711]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:37.392 --> 02:08:38.532]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:39.173 --> 02:08:39.973]  You want answers?
[02:08:40.753 --> 02:08:42.254]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:42.314 --> 02:08:45.896]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:46.496 --> 02:08:50.598]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:09:08.503 --> 02:09:27.675]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen now eight minutes thirty seconds into this third and final hour today the eighth day of january two thousand and seven two thousand seven just wow it's pretty scary to have israel
[02:09:30.174 --> 02:09:33.076]  Openly divulging a plan to attack Iran.
[02:09:35.397 --> 02:09:40.540]  And then at the same time, then pulling back and saying, no, we didn't threaten to attack Iran.
[02:09:41.301 --> 02:09:44.122]  When they clearly are threatening to nuke Iran.
[02:09:45.463 --> 02:09:52.147]  Of course, Israel... I mean, Olbert didn't accidentally admit they have nukes a month ago.
[02:09:52.207 --> 02:09:53.688]  This is all part of a larger program.
[02:09:54.830 --> 02:10:01.171]  And every intention, every indicator shows that there is going to be an attack on Iran sooner rather than later.
[02:10:02.572 --> 02:10:04.952]  And we're all just here waiting for the other shoe to drop.
[02:10:05.072 --> 02:10:14.054]  I frankly can't believe I've been talking about anything else but this, but I will get into it more in this hour, but what can we say we haven't said?
[02:10:16.014 --> 02:10:18.975]  I can comment on Bush and his trip surge, and I will,
[02:10:21.869 --> 02:10:23.409]  But right now, let's get to your calls.
[02:10:23.429 --> 02:10:25.270]  Linda in Austin, thanks for holding.
[02:10:25.290 --> 02:10:25.690]  Go ahead.
[02:10:27.190 --> 02:10:33.671]  Hi Alex, I wanted to respond to that person that was complaining to you about being upset and complaining too much.
[02:10:34.312 --> 02:10:45.654]  And I think that you're so different from mainstream media that's muckraking all the time because you actually are a true journalist that exposed
[02:10:47.572 --> 02:11:13.742]  Injustice and you are upset and then we the listeners equally enraged about our elections being stolen can then go to something like TexasTollParty.com and or we can try to stop the coal plants which you expose like Terry's 17 coal plants that are going to produce mercury all in the air and then we the citizens can take actions
[02:11:14.463 --> 02:11:23.070]  And go to Stop the Coal Plant and have petitions and participate and I want to let that listener know that you do service in the community.
[02:11:23.090 --> 02:11:39.665]  You show up at City Council hearing meetings and you show up at protests and if we all would act that way and take action throughout this year, maybe we'll be able to save Town Lake and stop the coal plants and get paper ballots because you do
[02:11:41.155 --> 02:11:49.019]  Expose what's going on and so then we can be upset and then we can take action and I support you and applaud you for that.
[02:11:49.059 --> 02:11:51.280]  Well listen, I appreciate that Linda, but let me just say this.
[02:11:52.321 --> 02:12:09.970]  I read that person's, or I paraphrased that person's, it's somewhere in the stacks, the actual, I keep saying email, it's a MySpace posting, because that individual said something that the majority of the minority group that criticizes me
[02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:27.644]  Regurgitate and repeat and it's that I'd be more effective if I didn't get so upset and I'm exaggerating but they never show where and in reality I am totally freaked out how bad things are.
[02:12:27.904 --> 02:12:34.490]  I can't find words to describe for people how systematic, how
[02:12:35.754 --> 02:12:38.035]  How multi-level this has been thought out.
[02:12:38.555 --> 02:12:40.176]  How evil these globalists are.
[02:12:40.236 --> 02:12:45.579]  And they openly say, I mean, David Rockefeller wrote in his memoirs that they plan to destroy U.S.
[02:12:45.619 --> 02:12:48.520]  sovereignty and that he is proud of it.
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:52.362]  And I still can't even convince people that it's happening!
[02:12:53.502 --> 02:12:56.964]  I mean, you know, they don't even believe in Lou Dobbs!
[02:12:57.184 --> 02:13:00.666]  So I don't know what we're supposed to say to people.
[02:13:01.661 --> 02:13:03.924]  Folks, I never claimed to be the cat's meow.
[02:13:03.964 --> 02:13:06.807]  I never claimed to be Mr. Rico Suave here.
[02:13:07.468 --> 02:13:08.709]  I'm just an average person.
[02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:14.996]  And frankly, you know, a lot of times I'm real up and happy and, you know, happy-go-lucky.
[02:13:15.036 --> 02:13:21.123]  But sometimes I get really upset because I'm tired of having myself to live my whole life focused on this stuff.
[02:13:21.838 --> 02:13:24.200]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:13:24.780 --> 02:13:33.926]  I mean, the fact that 78% of us don't want to be in Iraq, it's unconstitutional, they lied to get us there premeditatedly, and now they want to go into Iran?
[02:13:33.946 --> 02:13:36.807]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm mad about that!
[02:13:37.548 --> 02:13:38.689]  I'm upset about that!
[02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:48.975]  And even though I didn't care about Iraqi or Iranian children, I should care about, and I do, by the way, I should care about what it will do to our economy!
[02:13:49.665 --> 02:13:56.453]  Or the fact that it's not meant to bring freedom to those countries, but to make sure there's endless destabilization.
[02:13:56.854 --> 02:14:00.298]  Just so defense contractors have somewhere to sell their weapons systems.
[02:14:03.582 --> 02:14:04.243]  Anything else, Linda?
[02:14:05.659 --> 02:14:12.042]  I'm upset that mainstream media is a mouthpiece of all this corruption, even though we the people own the airwaves.
[02:14:12.162 --> 02:14:14.202]  And I know that you've spoken out about that.
[02:14:14.322 --> 02:14:21.925]  And I'm upset about MSG and aspartame and artificial flavors and colors that make us physically, mentally, emotionally sick or fat.
[02:14:22.406 --> 02:14:28.228]  And then they prescribed all kinds of dangerous, deadly drugs to counteract that condition.
[02:14:30.596 --> 02:14:38.979]  I just appreciate that you keep speaking out about these things, and there are a lot of people that are with you in that outrage.
[02:14:40.199 --> 02:14:42.020]  Well, I appreciate it, Linda, and thanks for the call.
[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:44.821]  The truth is, things are bad.
[02:14:44.841 --> 02:14:47.962]  There's a lot of good in the world.
[02:14:47.982 --> 02:14:54.985]  You know, the blue sky is pretty, your children are wonderful, your wife's wonderful, you may love your job.
[02:14:55.005 --> 02:14:56.185]  That's my point.
[02:14:56.785 --> 02:14:59.006]  We have to protect all the good.
[02:15:00.752 --> 02:15:03.533]  The bad is growing!
[02:15:03.553 --> 02:15:07.474]  I mean, empathy is just common sense.
[02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:27.019]  I mean, at a base instinctive level, I empathize with women and children being kidnapped by dying corps in Halliburton for sex slavery and factory slavery and the rest of it, because instinctively, I see everybody as my tribe.
[02:15:28.658 --> 02:15:31.820]  Whether it's an Eastern European or an Arabic woman.
[02:15:34.802 --> 02:15:35.442]  It doesn't matter.
[02:15:36.022 --> 02:15:49.230]  I mean, I realize that if weak, innocent people are being abused and bad things are happening to them, I empathize and care about them instantly because my programming is wired correctly, folks.
[02:15:49.690 --> 02:15:53.893]  If I see somebody else being abused, I realize that could happen to mine.
[02:15:54.533 --> 02:15:55.374]  That could happen to me.
[02:15:57.762 --> 02:15:59.663]  And so that's what a male is supposed to do.
[02:16:00.024 --> 02:16:11.151]  You see weak people being beat up on by big, strong, militarized males, and then a man wants to go and attack them.
[02:16:12.873 --> 02:16:16.635]  That's what all this macho aggression is for, folks.
[02:16:16.675 --> 02:16:21.899]  It's not for watching football and acting tough at the gym and strutting around, you know, trying to look cool.
[02:16:23.627 --> 02:16:28.169]  Okay, it's there to fight for your farm, fight for your hovel.
[02:16:28.909 --> 02:16:30.289]  It's to fight for your children.
[02:16:32.410 --> 02:16:33.551]  I mean, that's what it's all about.
[02:16:35.311 --> 02:16:38.192]  And so we have this world government who has declared war on us!
[02:16:40.813 --> 02:16:42.234]  I mean, they declared war on us!
[02:16:42.914 --> 02:16:45.895]  On the family, on our health, on everything!
[02:16:46.696 --> 02:16:47.697]  These are bad people!
[02:16:47.737 --> 02:16:48.797]  They practice evil!
[02:16:49.097 --> 02:17:08.486]  And their argument is, well, if we don't run all the evil monopolies, and if we don't run all the evil trades, somebody else will, and then we won't have the monopoly of control, and we're really the Illuminati guardians of light, but we must control the darkness to be a shepherd of it, so that someone else doesn't control it and use it.
[02:17:08.506 --> 02:17:09.447]  I mean, it's sick!
[02:17:12.097 --> 02:17:13.958]  That's their sick, twisted philosophy.
[02:17:14.078 --> 02:17:20.162]  No, you're just a bunch of control freaks that like power and like control and like to abuse innocence.
[02:17:22.204 --> 02:17:23.505]  And you need to be brought low.
[02:17:26.827 --> 02:17:27.848]  You need to be brought down.
[02:17:28.988 --> 02:17:30.249]  I mean, I'll be quite frank with you.
[02:17:30.309 --> 02:17:31.490]  I want these people to die.
[02:17:35.012 --> 02:17:40.656]  It'd be just like if a grizzly bear was about to come into my teepee and try to eat me.
[02:17:41.096 --> 02:17:41.817]  I'd want him dead.
[02:17:45.862 --> 02:17:47.083]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:17:47.163 --> 02:17:48.304]  It boils down to that.
[02:17:48.804 --> 02:17:50.105]  They've bought off our government.
[02:17:50.145 --> 02:17:52.166]  They've bought up our police and brainwashed them.
[02:17:52.566 --> 02:17:58.189]  They've bought up most our military control systems and have set the policies and have brainwashed them.
[02:17:58.230 --> 02:18:00.611]  They're turning our military into foreign troops.
[02:18:04.093 --> 02:18:05.354]  The process is happening.
[02:18:07.575 --> 02:18:13.839]  Go to your local college, all the new classes they're offering.
[02:18:15.513 --> 02:18:26.256]  Our criminal justice, law enforcement, anti-terrorism, homeland security, does nothing, produces nothing.
[02:18:26.997 --> 02:18:28.497]  But the elite understand that.
[02:18:28.557 --> 02:18:29.617]  We don't produce anything.
[02:18:29.637 --> 02:18:32.538]  And it's going to be less and less what we do produce.
[02:18:35.159 --> 02:18:38.940]  And so it's going to be just corralling us and keeping control of us.
[02:18:39.540 --> 02:18:41.221]  That's what you've got to look forward to.
[02:18:41.601 --> 02:18:43.161]  That's your weather forecast.
[02:18:44.062 --> 02:18:45.062]  Hope you enjoy it.
[02:18:46.423 --> 02:18:48.244]  And I'm sorry it's not a pretty picture.
[02:18:49.044 --> 02:19:04.711]  I mean, we're dealing with an elite that carried out 9-11, that's carried out sterilization programs all over the world, that's killed our own troops in declassified, admitted bioweapons and chemical tests where they knew it'd kill our troops.
[02:19:07.952 --> 02:19:10.333]  You know, young, shining faces of young men.
[02:19:10.653 --> 02:19:14.575]  They'll kill you in a second and think you're like a stick of bubblegum to them.
[02:19:16.184 --> 02:19:17.705]  You're lowered in toilet paper!
[02:19:18.445 --> 02:19:20.447]  I mean, you need to get that through your head!
[02:19:20.887 --> 02:19:30.252]  I'm so sick of watching people serve these elite cockroaches, when they don't just not care about you, they downright hate you!
[02:19:34.675 --> 02:19:43.060]  I mean, when I learned there were thousands of cases of where our own government knowingly killed our own troops, knowing it would kill them?
[02:19:45.273 --> 02:19:46.654]  I mean, that's a wake-up call.
[02:19:48.676 --> 02:19:49.697]  That's a wake-up call.
[02:19:52.158 --> 02:19:57.823]  And while the troops have got this illusion of red, white, and blue in their brain, and God and country, man, it's the opposite.
[02:19:57.843 --> 02:19:59.164]  You don't work for God and country.
[02:19:59.724 --> 02:20:03.547]  You work for a bunch of inbred elites.
[02:20:06.890 --> 02:20:08.051]  And when you find that out,
[02:20:10.524 --> 02:20:15.346]  And this elite is openly saying they want to reduce our population by 80 plus percent.
[02:20:16.106 --> 02:20:18.387]  They're openly saying they want to break up our families.
[02:20:19.048 --> 02:20:21.229]  They openly say our families are bad.
[02:20:21.249 --> 02:20:24.530]  They've done a pretty good job of destroying them so far.
[02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:27.651]  And it doesn't get any better from here, it just gets worse and worse!
[02:20:28.011 --> 02:20:29.072]  We gotta turn it around!
[02:20:30.856 --> 02:20:31.817]  Good morning, honey.
[02:20:32.177 --> 02:20:38.200]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:20:38.460 --> 02:20:39.081]  Yeah.
[02:20:39.441 --> 02:20:40.861]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:20:41.222 --> 02:20:44.624]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:20:45.104 --> 02:20:46.585]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:20:47.045 --> 02:20:48.726]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:20:49.126 --> 02:20:50.887]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:20:51.087 --> 02:20:52.008]  Honey, cheer up!
[02:20:52.369 --> 02:20:54.631]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:20:54.892 --> 02:20:55.212]  What?
[02:20:55.653 --> 02:21:06.145]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:21:06.425 --> 02:21:11.251]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?

[02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:32.561]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:33.161 --> 02:21:39.004]  Did you know that the mother of all secret societies, the Illuminati, worships Lucifer, better known as Satan the Devil?
[02:21:39.945 --> 02:21:46.668]  Did you know that they are the individuals giving rise to the final world social system described in Revelation Chapter 13?
[02:21:48.189 --> 02:21:52.891]  Did you know they were the founders of international communism to be the seen enemy of Christianity?
[02:21:53.411 --> 02:21:58.834]  To be used to destroy America so that we could be merged into an all-powerful, one-world government?

[02:22:32.225 --> 02:22:35.747]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:22:36.968 --> 02:22:41.791]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:22:41.991 --> 02:22:44.733]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:22:44.773 --> 02:22:45.893]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:22:47.234 --> 02:22:51.817]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:22:52.758 --> 02:22:59.962]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:23:01.002 --> 02:23:04.064]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[02:23:06.226 --> 02:23:09.669]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:23:10.649 --> 02:23:11.950]  Call for your copy today.
[02:23:12.171 --> 02:23:14.392]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:15.433 --> 02:23:21.277]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:23:21.978 --> 02:23:22.398]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:22.438 --> 02:23:22.638]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:30.106 --> 02:23:31.807]  Shall I unic... Oh, wait!
[02:23:31.947 --> 02:23:33.027]  Why did you turn that down?
[02:23:33.047 --> 02:23:35.648]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:23:36.148 --> 02:23:40.630]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:23:40.810 --> 02:23:43.251]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:23:43.511 --> 02:23:44.712]  I could use something like that.
[02:23:44.792 --> 02:23:47.133]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[02:23:47.273 --> 02:23:50.174]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:23:50.214 --> 02:23:52.034]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:23:52.134 --> 02:23:54.395]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:23:54.755 --> 02:23:55.396]  I guess you're right.
[02:23:55.776 --> 02:23:56.476]  Why don't we try it?
[02:23:56.636 --> 02:23:58.597]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:23:59.017 --> 02:24:03.380]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:24:03.400 --> 02:24:05.081]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:24:05.481 --> 02:24:09.844]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:24:10.084 --> 02:24:13.386]  The bed fan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.
[02:24:13.606 --> 02:24:15.187]  With our 30-day 100% guarantee, you risk nothing.
[02:24:17.128 --> 02:24:18.009]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[02:24:18.209 --> 02:24:19.509]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[02:24:19.669 --> 02:24:20.970]  The BedFan is the answer.
[02:24:21.230 --> 02:24:24.572]  Visit us today at www.bedfan.com.
[02:24:24.852 --> 02:24:27.613]  That's www.bedfan.com.
[02:24:27.713 --> 02:24:29.354]  That's B-E-D F-A-N.
[02:24:29.834 --> 02:24:37.778]  This is not America.
[02:24:38.399 --> 02:24:40.360]  Sha-la-la-la-la.
[02:24:48.374 --> 02:25:02.436]  When we come back in the next break, I will get into the whole Nuke Iran story, the troop surge, and I'll comment on why people are comfortable having a camera and microphone built into their computer, watching and listening to everything you do, audibly.
[02:25:03.517 --> 02:25:06.397]  Not just digitally tracking what you're doing online.
[02:25:06.417 --> 02:25:07.617]  I mean, what's going on in your house.
[02:25:08.918 --> 02:25:12.058]  Versus freaking out if their neighbor got caught doing it to them.
[02:25:12.718 --> 02:25:13.538]  We'll talk about that.
[02:25:14.879 --> 02:25:17.599]  As I thought about the psychology, maybe you have your own view on it,
[02:25:18.297 --> 02:25:21.439]  Or maybe you think I'm with Al Qaeda because I don't want cameras watching us, you know?
[02:25:21.459 --> 02:25:24.862]  I mean, it's like the Houston police chief last year came out.
[02:25:24.902 --> 02:25:26.563]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:25:27.864 --> 02:25:35.369]  I mean, I remember when I heard it, I didn't believe it, and it was on the news, and the police chief said, well, we think all the houses now in Houston need cameras.
[02:25:35.409 --> 02:25:36.390]  This will stop crime.
[02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:39.912]  Cameras in the houses that the police watch!
[02:25:43.435 --> 02:25:45.116]  It's like that Bergen County police chief.
[02:25:45.156 --> 02:25:46.137]  Everybody needs a chip.
[02:25:46.177 --> 02:25:47.718]  I'll be for forcing you to take them.
[02:25:48.835 --> 02:25:51.777]  Again, you cannot... They're the Froot Loops, folks!
[02:25:52.598 --> 02:25:57.961]  But they're so basted in tyranny that they think they're normal and we're bad!
[02:25:57.981 --> 02:26:00.063]  Alright.
[02:26:02.084 --> 02:26:02.924]  Let's go over your calls.
[02:26:02.984 --> 02:26:04.626]  Rick in Ohio, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:26:05.446 --> 02:26:05.986]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:06.827 --> 02:26:08.608]  Thanks for being here.
[02:26:08.628 --> 02:26:14.512]  I've awoken in the last approximately six months and I don't even know where, how, or why.
[02:26:16.291 --> 02:26:17.552]  There's two things I want to get to.
[02:26:17.792 --> 02:26:27.557]  One is, my daughter is going to court tomorrow, and we believe it's a direct result of wearing a 9-11 Truth Info Wars bracelet.
[02:26:28.397 --> 02:26:29.918]  And the thing I want to... Well, what happened?
[02:26:29.958 --> 02:26:32.380]  I mean, I'm... What did they claim she did?
[02:26:32.780 --> 02:26:39.984]  Well, I want to bring up one other thing first, and that is, um, you're destroyed by design, uh, DVD.
[02:26:41.344 --> 02:26:42.465]  Um, there's a...
[02:26:43.052 --> 02:27:09.137]  Google Movie called Peace Propaganda and the Promised Land when it tells about the you know how they're taking the land away from the Palestinians and dividing them up and divide and conquer and they can't get around and all that kind of stuff and I've watched part of most of that a couple times and it gets some of it's a gruesome I kind of shut down and can't process information have to take a break but when watching your film I was realizing the same
[02:27:10.538 --> 02:27:13.680]  Mapping of the breaking up and dividing the land.
[02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:20.945]  No, no, they're going to use the roads and wall the roads off and not let us travel in most areas and totally control mobility.
[02:27:20.985 --> 02:27:21.606]  That's admitted.
[02:27:21.866 --> 02:27:23.327]  Oh, yes, absolutely, sir.
[02:27:23.367 --> 02:27:23.687]  Yes.
[02:27:23.827 --> 02:27:25.549]  Yeah, you can see the same things coming.
[02:27:25.609 --> 02:27:31.653]  If you don't have the chip or in the chosen few, you're going to be quartered off and you'll be stuck.
[02:27:32.153 --> 02:27:34.295]  And you can see they're using the same thing.
[02:27:34.775 --> 02:27:36.977]  You know, the patterns are the same to me.
[02:27:38.077 --> 02:27:40.119]  And moving to what happened to my daughter.
[02:27:41.060 --> 02:27:43.641]  Some of this is subjective on our part.
[02:27:43.741 --> 02:27:44.501]  Okay, what happened?
[02:27:45.022 --> 02:27:47.182]  Because it was a three-day ordeal.
[02:27:47.683 --> 02:27:52.624]  My daughter suffers from Crohn's, and she's in her 30s.
[02:27:52.704 --> 02:27:55.446]  She's been in and out of the hospital many times.
[02:27:55.506 --> 02:27:58.307]  She has a really big, serious problem with her intestines.
[02:27:58.907 --> 02:27:59.607]  Right, right.
[02:27:59.767 --> 02:28:02.068]  And when she gets the flare-ups, she starts
[02:28:02.535 --> 02:28:07.917]  Losing it out of both ends, gets mainly really heavy, dehydrated, has a lot of pain.
[02:28:08.277 --> 02:28:10.018]  And so they said this was evil?
[02:28:10.478 --> 02:28:13.940]  Well, she goes to emergency like 2 o'clock in the morning.
[02:28:14.240 --> 02:28:17.381]  They're not giving help, they're having trouble getting an I.D.
[02:28:17.401 --> 02:28:17.441]  in.
[02:28:17.881 --> 02:28:19.342]  About 4 a.m.
[02:28:19.582 --> 02:28:27.025]  this doctor comes in and he sees her 9-11, his inside job, InfraWars bracelet on.
[02:28:27.065 --> 02:28:28.265]  He's like, what's this about?
[02:28:29.145 --> 02:28:29.346]  And so,
[02:28:30.754 --> 02:28:32.375]  Like I said, she's not feeling pretty good.
[02:28:32.435 --> 02:28:33.716]  He watches Jack Bauer.
[02:28:33.756 --> 02:28:36.618]  He's about to be a commander of Save America.
[02:28:36.638 --> 02:28:39.060]  He's kind of a Class A personality.
[02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:40.701]  You can probably relate there.
[02:28:41.321 --> 02:28:44.383]  So anyway, and she's like, you know, it's just information.
[02:28:44.423 --> 02:28:45.444]  Go and see yourself.
[02:28:45.504 --> 02:28:54.090]  In fact, she had one of, when the Military Commissions Act came down, I bought a burner, started handing out.
[02:28:54.250 --> 02:28:56.412]  I go in and out of being safe with that.
[02:28:56.912 --> 02:28:58.293]  But anyway, so she had a 9-1-1.
[02:29:01.924 --> 02:29:06.507]  Yes, I understand.
[02:29:08.069 --> 02:29:27.865]  He must have flagged her, because she's not feeling too good, he leaves at 6am, the other shifts come in, they have questions, they do all this kind of stuff, they ask her about her pain, she says, well sometimes I feel so bad, I feel like cutting it out myself.
[02:29:31.676 --> 02:29:32.859]  A lot of time it went down.
[02:29:32.899 --> 02:29:33.881]  They put her in a room.
[02:29:33.901 --> 02:29:36.627]  They stripped her and put her in a room for like 12 hours.
[02:29:36.667 --> 02:29:37.669]  They had her under watch.
[02:29:37.749 --> 02:29:39.433]  Yeah, they claim she was suicidal.
[02:29:40.514 --> 02:29:46.059]  It's like the last lady writes a letter to the editor who said nothing about it, and so they swat her.
[02:29:46.419 --> 02:29:50.342]  You'd see you're now mentally ill if you don't believe.
[02:29:50.642 --> 02:29:52.704]  They really found WMDs.
[02:29:53.444 --> 02:29:55.386]  World government's good.
[02:29:55.726 --> 02:29:57.868]  The president never lies.
[02:29:57.888 --> 02:30:00.470]  There's no money missing from the Pentagon.
[02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:01.211]  Everything's fine.
[02:30:01.411 --> 02:30:05.594]  Well, stay there, sir, but you've got to quickly, because I want to hear the story, but you've got to just tell it.
[02:30:06.331 --> 02:30:08.413]  Because I got a bunch of news and a bunch of calls.
[02:30:08.954 --> 02:30:10.315]  That's why some days I don't take calls.
[02:30:10.356 --> 02:30:15.241]  I like your calls, but then I just can't ever seem to give people what they want enough time, you know?
[02:30:16.522 --> 02:30:17.423]  Because we're in hell.
[02:30:19.946 --> 02:30:20.887]  We're on the march.
[02:30:21.348 --> 02:30:22.970]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:23.871 --> 02:30:26.554]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:32.065 --> 02:30:36.186]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:30:36.426 --> 02:30:38.187]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:30:38.447 --> 02:30:44.729]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:30:45.009 --> 02:30:51.130]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:51.390 --> 02:30:53.231]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:30:53.271 --> 02:30:58.834]  It uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[02:30:59.194 --> 02:31:04.116]  The 2006 BioSolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:31:04.256 --> 02:31:07.798]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:31:08.098 --> 02:31:11.800]  Simple step by step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:31:12.000 --> 02:31:14.521]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:31:14.661 --> 02:31:15.722]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:31:16.002 --> 02:31:17.044]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:31:17.164 --> 02:31:19.969]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:19.989 --> 02:31:20.430]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:20.450 --> 02:31:20.510]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:31:30.171 --> 02:31:34.114]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[02:31:34.335 --> 02:31:37.877]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[02:31:38.158 --> 02:31:42.241]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[02:31:42.541 --> 02:31:43.482]  I was so amazed.
[02:31:43.702 --> 02:31:46.605]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[02:31:46.745 --> 02:31:48.626]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[02:31:49.007 --> 02:31:54.211]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[02:31:54.671 --> 02:32:00.575]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[02:32:00.856 --> 02:32:02.577]  I figured it would clean really well.
[02:32:02.817 --> 02:32:06.019]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[02:32:06.199 --> 02:32:10.102]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[02:32:10.362 --> 02:32:11.903]  Plus, the service was great.

[02:32:29.734 --> 02:32:32.496]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[02:32:32.816 --> 02:32:39.299]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription pill.

[02:33:23.112 --> 02:33:23.772]  Look, it's simple.
[02:33:23.873 --> 02:33:25.334]  The economy is shifting over into
[02:33:40.513 --> 02:33:42.033]  Nothing but a predatory system.
[02:33:43.154 --> 02:33:47.934]  The elites don't want free market, they don't want any pools of independent resources or people.
[02:33:48.875 --> 02:33:55.836]  And so now, if you say anything that they can construe as suicidal, you're gone into the system.
[02:33:56.636 --> 02:34:01.937]  If you can do anything that they can construe as a threat to the government, they arrest you.
[02:34:02.937 --> 02:34:05.958]  If you argue with them, they arrest you, beat you up and then frame you.
[02:34:07.027 --> 02:34:11.468]  The public schools are there to get your child into prison.
[02:34:12.328 --> 02:34:16.229]  Everything is designed to get us into the system, by hook or by crook.
[02:34:16.830 --> 02:34:17.790]  It's about control.
[02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:22.271]  The elites, they own the money machines that print the money, folks.
[02:34:22.631 --> 02:34:24.252]  They're not there to make money.
[02:34:24.552 --> 02:34:25.992]  They literally make the money.
[02:34:27.643 --> 02:34:29.664]  It's all about monopolies.
[02:34:30.224 --> 02:34:33.925]  And they've gotten monopolies in industry, in science, in almost every area.
[02:34:34.525 --> 02:34:40.606]  Now they're moving into the last monopoly of thought, of action, land.
[02:34:41.926 --> 02:34:42.947]  They're mopping up.
[02:34:44.827 --> 02:34:45.467]  Real fast.
[02:34:46.067 --> 02:34:51.809]  Rick, to make a long story short, so now they got her locked up naked because she went in there sick at the hospital.
[02:34:52.289 --> 02:34:53.449]  Now you say she's going to court.
[02:34:53.869 --> 02:34:54.670]  How did it all end?
[02:34:55.550 --> 02:34:56.410]  Well, at some time,
[02:34:56.986 --> 02:35:00.633]  She got some freedom back, was going to go out to smoke, and they said she couldn't leave.
[02:35:00.713 --> 02:35:01.635]  And she said, I'm not leaving.
[02:35:01.655 --> 02:35:02.597]  I don't have a car here.
[02:35:02.617 --> 02:35:03.939]  They called the police.
[02:35:04.827 --> 02:35:08.090]  One of those Roy police cops, up against the wall, ruffs her up.
[02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:09.811]  And then he claims she assaulted him.
[02:35:10.311 --> 02:35:12.273]  Yeah, and uh... It's always the same.
[02:35:12.293 --> 02:35:13.614]  They took her to the loony bin.
[02:35:13.654 --> 02:35:22.340]  That's why smart people, when the cop arrives, you literally, you literally put your hands behind your head and lay on the ground, and they'll trick you.
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:23.381]  They'll say, get up!
[02:35:23.762 --> 02:35:25.983]  And then when you get up, that's assault, okay?
[02:35:26.303 --> 02:35:28.005]  And it doesn't matter, squad car cameras.
[02:35:28.085 --> 02:35:30.787]  I've been at courts, folks, where you don't touch them!
[02:35:31.207 --> 02:35:32.228]  And they charge you with it.
[02:35:32.468 --> 02:35:40.673]  You've got to totally jellyfish or you're going to spend time in prison because these juries are a bunch of bootlicking scum.
[02:35:40.873 --> 02:35:42.234]  They want to destroy America.
[02:35:42.474 --> 02:35:44.035]  They all think they're Jack Bauer.
[02:35:44.575 --> 02:35:45.936]  And that's just how it operates.
[02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:46.857]  And hey, good!
[02:35:46.897 --> 02:35:48.257]  Your money's going to be worthless.
[02:35:48.438 --> 02:35:49.678]  You're going to have nothing.
[02:35:49.838 --> 02:35:51.860]  I'm talking to the cops, the military, everybody.
[02:35:52.120 --> 02:35:53.441]  You want to slit America's throat?
[02:35:53.721 --> 02:35:54.761]  I got one solace.
[02:35:54.781 --> 02:35:55.862]  You're slitting your own.
[02:35:56.042 --> 02:35:57.043]  You go right ahead.
[02:35:57.623 --> 02:35:58.043]  I'm sorry.
[02:35:58.284 --> 02:36:01.766]  Okay, so then he comes out and he roughs her up, and then that's not enough for him.
[02:36:01.786 --> 02:36:02.907]  He wants to go ahead and ruin her life.
[02:36:03.227 --> 02:36:04.628]  Yeah, he takes to the loony bin.
[02:36:05.269 --> 02:36:07.330]  She spends about two days in there.
[02:36:07.390 --> 02:36:09.932]  They recognize right away she doesn't belong there.
[02:36:09.992 --> 02:36:15.116]  They let her loose after about a day and a half, and so this was Friday.
[02:36:15.156 --> 02:36:15.596]  She got out.
[02:36:15.636 --> 02:36:16.837]  Her husband comes to pick her up.
[02:36:16.897 --> 02:36:20.379]  All the nurses are crying because they see that she has a husband that cares about her.
[02:36:20.419 --> 02:36:22.681]  He's covered with mud because he's a contract worker.
[02:36:23.608 --> 02:36:25.329]  She's got a one and a three-year-old.
[02:36:25.429 --> 02:36:28.952]  I'm going tomorrow to babysit the little kids because she's got to go to court.
[02:36:29.372 --> 02:36:32.034]  And the hospital won't release any records.
[02:36:32.074 --> 02:36:34.336]  They say they've got to wait 30 days.
[02:36:36.697 --> 02:36:38.759]  But she's being charged with assaulting a god.
[02:36:39.379 --> 02:36:39.659]  Yes.
[02:36:41.180 --> 02:36:42.461]  Well, I mean, you don't listen.
[02:36:43.702 --> 02:36:44.283]  This is freedom.
[02:36:46.668 --> 02:36:49.490]  Uh, you know, she needs to, look, they'll try to make her plea bargain.
[02:36:49.730 --> 02:36:51.871]  First, they'll threaten her that she'll go to jail for her whole life.
[02:36:52.372 --> 02:36:57.615]  And my advice, and this is what I would do, and I'm not telling you what to do, because it's different in every case, but this is generally.
[02:36:58.035 --> 02:37:03.799]  You just keep demanding a trial by a jury of your peers, you demand the thing, and basically
[02:37:05.308 --> 02:37:07.210]  You'll have to find some activist lawyer.
[02:37:07.450 --> 02:37:08.770]  Don't get some mainline lawyer.
[02:37:09.051 --> 02:37:13.693]  You've got to find a lawyer that hates the system and just wants to defeat them.
[02:37:14.293 --> 02:37:15.154]  They are out there.
[02:37:15.254 --> 02:37:17.175]  Or you can be self-schooled yourself.
[02:37:17.635 --> 02:37:20.117]  And you ignore the judge because he'll keep saying, shut up.
[02:37:20.177 --> 02:37:23.278]  You just go, you've all heard about how they beat you up and claim you assaulted them.
[02:37:23.679 --> 02:37:24.999]  Ask the officer where he got hurt.
[02:37:25.019 --> 02:37:25.800]  I'm at a hospital.
[02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:26.540]  They won't let me in.
[02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:27.661]  They just do this for no reason.
[02:37:30.677 --> 02:37:31.257]  I'm a mother.
[02:37:31.277 --> 02:37:32.739]  You don't want to put me in jail, do you?
[02:37:33.059 --> 02:37:34.461]  And they're going to let her off.
[02:37:35.041 --> 02:37:36.823]  Long before then, they'll probably drop it.
[02:37:38.405 --> 02:37:42.109]  Okay, and just pray to God to deal with that cop.
[02:37:42.149 --> 02:37:44.972]  You know, your daughter's telling the truth and didn't do anything.
[02:37:45.312 --> 02:37:46.273]  It's the same ML always.
[02:37:46.313 --> 02:37:46.854]  I'm sure it's true.
[02:37:47.114 --> 02:37:47.755]  Don't worry about it.
[02:37:47.815 --> 02:37:48.936]  God will deal with that cop.
[02:37:50.297 --> 02:38:00.867]  And you know, so let's just get her had to be that first doctor that was a former military doctor that didn't like a wristband that must put something in her folder that, you know, made this whole thing react.
[02:38:01.147 --> 02:38:10.415]  Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[02:38:12.094 --> 02:38:14.076]  We're mentally ill, or we're terrorists.
[02:38:14.096 --> 02:38:17.298]  I mean, I have Michael Medved, Laura Ingraham saying I should be arrested.
[02:38:17.859 --> 02:38:19.020]  These people don't play around.
[02:38:19.060 --> 02:38:20.121]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:38:20.881 --> 02:38:25.045]  I mean, you know, it's... Our government put Mao into power.
[02:38:25.065 --> 02:38:25.945]  They now admit it.
[02:38:25.965 --> 02:38:29.168]  I mean, we knew it decades ago, but they now admit it.
[02:38:29.568 --> 02:38:30.669]  What does that say to you?
[02:38:30.689 --> 02:38:33.211]  A government that would put Mao in.
[02:38:33.251 --> 02:38:34.412]  Now, are those good people?
[02:38:35.513 --> 02:38:37.475]  As soon as they're able to,
[02:38:39.082 --> 02:38:43.423]  As soon as they think they can get away with it, they'll do that here.
[02:38:44.364 --> 02:38:46.284]  Everything is in preparation for that.
[02:38:47.845 --> 02:38:56.407]  As soon as enough people think that heroes torture children and are Jack Bauer, they'll Jack Bauer everybody.
[02:38:57.987 --> 02:38:59.988]  And they just can't wait.
[02:39:01.188 --> 02:39:02.209]  They cannot wait.
[02:39:02.229 --> 02:39:03.329]  They're cowardly scum.
[02:39:07.040 --> 02:39:08.381]  They've got a rude awakening, though.
[02:39:10.762 --> 02:39:11.822]  I'm out of control, folks.
[02:39:11.962 --> 02:39:12.342]  Joe?
[02:39:12.362 --> 02:39:14.523]  Joe, where are you calling us from?
[02:39:15.104 --> 02:39:15.284]  Yes.
[02:39:15.304 --> 02:39:17.445]  Yes, sir, where are you calling us from?
[02:39:17.805 --> 02:39:18.425]  Minneapolis.
[02:39:18.985 --> 02:39:19.486]  Minneapolis.
[02:39:19.526 --> 02:39:20.066]  What's on your mind?
[02:39:20.466 --> 02:39:21.967]  Yeah, I was curious.
[02:39:22.387 --> 02:39:31.751]  In 1985, I was in high school, and in one of our classes, they forced us, the teacher forced everybody
[02:39:32.310 --> 02:39:41.555]  In our class to sit down in front of a video camera with sound and everything and come up with a little presentation and put it on some kind of file.
[02:39:42.315 --> 02:39:48.378]  She said that we would be, we would, we would fail, she would fail us if we did not do this.
[02:39:49.295 --> 02:39:50.957]  And it seemed pretty suspicious.
[02:39:51.017 --> 02:39:51.898]  Why do you think they would do that?
[02:39:51.938 --> 02:39:54.821]  Well, they've got all sorts of experimentation in public schools.
[02:39:54.841 --> 02:39:56.623]  Dioxins in your food and water.
[02:39:57.244 --> 02:40:00.046]  They've got all sorts of face scanning systems in for years.
[02:40:00.767 --> 02:40:05.893]  That might have just been some hokey thing she was doing for a PhD or something.
[02:40:05.933 --> 02:40:06.533]  You never know.
[02:40:07.174 --> 02:40:07.514]  I don't know.
[02:40:10.462 --> 02:40:19.149]  So, some of these people would do this for any number of reasons and not really tell us why, but they really don't have the right to do that with their kids, right?
[02:40:20.110 --> 02:40:20.671]  No, they don't.
[02:40:21.191 --> 02:40:22.672]  It's a public school, isn't it?
[02:40:24.334 --> 02:40:25.835]  What does that statement mean?
[02:40:27.637 --> 02:40:34.522]  Well, I mean, it's not like some private enrolled school where you pay for it and have their own rules, you know?
[02:40:35.863 --> 02:40:37.024]  Well, exactly, but...
[02:40:38.166 --> 02:40:41.267]  Number one, you can't experiment on people without their consent.
[02:40:41.327 --> 02:40:43.008]  You can't videotape people.
[02:40:43.228 --> 02:40:44.209]  Well, she threatened us.
[02:40:44.289 --> 02:40:46.370]  She said that she would bail us.
[02:40:46.810 --> 02:40:48.911]  That we were required to do it.
[02:40:49.191 --> 02:40:50.031]  What class was it?
[02:40:50.491 --> 02:40:52.392]  It was an English Literature class.
[02:40:52.512 --> 02:40:54.513]  And all the kids out were like seniors.
[02:40:54.613 --> 02:40:55.834]  I was in like ninth grade.
[02:40:55.854 --> 02:41:00.296]  It was probably a federal grant and probably went to some database.
[02:41:00.916 --> 02:41:02.697]  Well, they acted very suspicious.
[02:41:03.337 --> 02:41:04.578]  And then they kicked me out.
[02:41:05.922 --> 02:41:07.783]  And, uh, I had to get a GED.
[02:41:07.963 --> 02:41:10.945]  They started picking on me for nothing.
[02:41:10.965 --> 02:41:11.845]  Well, you're probably all caught up.
[02:41:13.406 --> 02:41:18.689]  Well, yeah, they did set me up when I was in seventh grade, too, with terroristic threats.
[02:41:18.869 --> 02:41:20.370]  Oh, yeah, that's a good one, yeah.
[02:41:20.390 --> 02:41:22.050]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:41:22.090 --> 02:41:24.272]  I gotta jump, but let me just comment on what you just said.
[02:41:24.292 --> 02:41:29.774]  Remember Bill Clinton, Al Gore, wanted to put computers in all the schools for the children?
[02:41:32.056 --> 02:41:32.596]  Remember that?
[02:41:33.394 --> 02:41:51.244]  Well, what they do is they keep, and it's under federal grants, remember that's a federal program, and then so now in English, in math, in everything, including your journal, that's all done on disk, even if you do it in homework, and it's put on the file, and they admittedly keep that in federal and state databases.
[02:41:54.125 --> 02:41:59.268]  And now, now we'd already heard this, but back in 99 we got the actual documents.
[02:42:02.308 --> 02:42:03.768]  We have this in my film, The Takeover.
[02:42:04.889 --> 02:42:12.231]  All over the country, they have BATF deputized sheriff's deputies.
[02:42:14.391 --> 02:42:16.652]  But they're certified Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Fire.
[02:42:16.672 --> 02:42:19.593]  In some cases, FBI or Secret Service, but mainly BATF.
[02:42:20.173 --> 02:42:21.973]  And they go in in the 6th and 7th grade.
[02:42:22.013 --> 02:42:23.374]  They have whole semester classes.
[02:42:23.854 --> 02:42:27.395]  And it says they will interact with the students at lunch, whenever they wish.
[02:42:27.615 --> 02:42:28.515]  This is for the grant money.
[02:42:30.249 --> 02:42:37.474]  And they have them on computers, write a daily journal up, and they ask them about mom and dad, what kind of guns they've got.
[02:42:37.494 --> 02:42:39.255]  This is in the news, okay?
[02:42:39.575 --> 02:42:44.158]  I mean, I actually got the documents from parents in the area who got mad and sued over it.
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:47.540]  And so, yeah.
[02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:55.125]  Now, when they got caught doing this, they said, oh, we're just putting it in a federal database to check for plagiarism.
[02:42:56.309 --> 02:43:03.951]  And then to make that true, they did buy some program where it goes off nationally to be checked for plagiarism, where it checks for keywords.
[02:43:09.333 --> 02:43:12.594]  I'm pretty sure it's mildly corrupt where I am, Mayor.
[02:43:14.254 --> 02:43:14.694]  Oh, it is.
[02:43:14.734 --> 02:43:15.614]  Listen, I'm going to let you go.
[02:43:15.674 --> 02:43:16.615]  I appreciate your call.
[02:43:17.255 --> 02:43:20.236]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Texas.
[02:43:20.256 --> 02:43:21.436]  I've got to get to this Israel thing.
[02:43:21.496 --> 02:43:22.136]  Robert, go ahead.
[02:43:23.016 --> 02:43:24.277]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:43:24.477 --> 02:43:24.837]  Pretty good.
[02:43:25.774 --> 02:43:27.995]  Okay, I got a question for you.
[02:43:28.135 --> 02:43:30.717]  On the 9-11, the four plane incident?
[02:43:31.097 --> 02:43:31.377]  Yes.
[02:43:33.078 --> 02:43:37.000]  I'm trying to sort this thing out.
[02:43:38.041 --> 02:43:48.427]  If you got two planes that crashed on the ground, as far as the one in Pennsylvania, and those weren't planes that did that, what happened to
[02:43:48.806 --> 02:43:52.747]  People, the manifest, the people that was on those planes, where were those people at?
[02:43:53.107 --> 02:43:54.748]  Yeah, who's film are you talking about?
[02:43:54.768 --> 02:43:56.168]  Are you talking about... No, I don't know.
[02:43:56.208 --> 02:43:58.249]  I've seen several different things on it.
[02:43:58.309 --> 02:44:09.413]  I mean, as far as the hole in the Pentagon and different things about the PA plane that was supposed to have went down in Pennsylvania.
[02:44:09.593 --> 02:44:09.793]  Sure.
[02:44:09.873 --> 02:44:16.475]  If you see Terror Storm, or you see Road to Tyranny, or Martial Law,
[02:44:18.726 --> 02:44:19.847]  My film's about 9-11.
[02:44:22.708 --> 02:44:25.589]  And Road to Tyranny's the first film on 9-11.
[02:44:27.450 --> 02:44:31.611]  You won't hear any discussion about where there are dummy planes, where there are pods.
[02:44:33.032 --> 02:44:36.994]  And again, I'm not knocking those that do that, but they'll knock me.
[02:44:37.054 --> 02:44:41.595]  I've got to accept their orthodoxy around Beelzebub in this whole thing.
[02:44:43.236 --> 02:44:45.477]  I stick to what I can prove.
[02:44:47.058 --> 02:44:47.738]  And I stick
[02:44:48.487 --> 02:44:52.490]  To what, if I was a prosecutor, what I would put on in court.
[02:44:55.051 --> 02:45:00.395]  And so, people can debate all day, did they switch the planes?
[02:45:00.655 --> 02:45:04.738]  And because Northwoods, Northwoods talks about switching planes.
[02:45:05.618 --> 02:45:09.681]  And so loose change second edition shows Northwoods, the official U.S.
[02:45:09.721 --> 02:45:12.243]  government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks,
[02:45:12.876 --> 02:45:18.541]  And people get confused and go, oh well, then they're saying that they must have done this.
[02:45:18.581 --> 02:45:21.164]  No, they're just looking at that, asking the question.
[02:45:22.845 --> 02:45:23.806]  Because an official U.S.
[02:45:23.826 --> 02:45:36.618]  government plan says they'll have a plane take off with government agents claiming they died, they'll later stage their deaths, give them new names, and then they're really going to have a dummy plane with nobody on board, and then blow it up.
[02:45:38.380 --> 02:45:42.925]  So because that's in the government plan, that's where you hear all that stuff start up from.
[02:45:43.525 --> 02:45:45.688]  But I don't believe that's what happened on 9-11.
[02:45:48.130 --> 02:45:49.672]  There was some chicanery.
[02:45:50.555 --> 02:45:50.675]  Okay.
[02:45:50.715 --> 02:45:51.795]  Alright, like I said, I haven't got those
[02:46:20.074 --> 02:46:24.595]  I don't have any DVDs yet, but I'm going to get those and get your take on it, sir.
[02:46:25.015 --> 02:46:25.575]  Thank you, sir.
[02:46:25.615 --> 02:46:26.756]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:29.156 --> 02:46:35.898]  Again, the real world is a very complex place.
[02:46:38.338 --> 02:46:41.359]  And the establishment knows that we want it all simple.
[02:46:43.499 --> 02:46:45.940]  Osama bad, America good.
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:47.500]  There's some brown people over there.
[02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:50.601]  We're going over there to get them there so they don't get us here.
[02:46:54.222 --> 02:46:54.982]  Hey, did you hear?
[02:46:55.002 --> 02:46:56.122]  There was a nuclear spill.
[02:46:56.162 --> 02:46:57.082]  The Army saved us.
[02:46:59.343 --> 02:47:01.063]  Because that was announced 50 times.
[02:47:01.103 --> 02:47:03.204]  Then one time at midnight they announced it was a drill.
[02:47:06.805 --> 02:47:07.645]  See how that works?
[02:47:08.085 --> 02:47:09.745]  They treat you like you're stupid.
[02:47:10.226 --> 02:47:11.686]  They treat you like you're children.
[02:47:14.855 --> 02:47:15.975]  And they just move forward.
[02:47:16.195 --> 02:47:19.136]  I mean, how many years ago did we tell you they were reading your mail?
[02:47:21.536 --> 02:47:25.337]  I mean, folks, they tear into mail all the time.
[02:47:27.057 --> 02:47:29.158]  They sled up in the mail and read letters.
[02:47:29.218 --> 02:47:33.859]  That's what they do now at the Postal Service.
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:39.300]  They've been taught that's okay now.
[02:47:42.572 --> 02:47:46.475]  And Tom Martino called me up a couple days ago and said, oh, we gotta have you on the show!
[02:47:46.995 --> 02:47:49.918]  You were on with us six months ago and you talked about him reading our mail!
[02:47:50.438 --> 02:47:51.739]  How'd you know that?
[02:47:56.723 --> 02:47:58.264]  None of this stuff's really secret.
[02:48:03.608 --> 02:48:07.931]  On the Israel situation,
[02:48:11.707 --> 02:48:16.869]  A member came out over a year ago, Cy Hirsch, New Yorker Magazine, that the U.S.
[02:48:16.889 --> 02:48:27.493]  had transferred a bunch of bunker-busting nukes to Israel to be used on Iran, and they'd built a bunch more over here in the U.S.
[02:48:27.573 --> 02:48:28.233]  for other use.
[02:48:31.434 --> 02:48:36.216]  And then all these experts came out and said, well, wait a minute, you don't even need nukes to knock out these facilities.
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:49.208]  I mean, you can certainly cave in all the entrances and seriously damage them and bomb everything in the vicinity and keep that facility, you know, out of... you don't need to use nukes.
[02:48:49.829 --> 02:48:53.252]  And they're just like, we don't care, we want to set the precedent to use nuclear weapons.
[02:48:54.833 --> 02:48:56.735]  Hell, they already use dirty bombs, do you?
[02:48:57.455 --> 02:48:57.916]  Why not?
[02:48:57.936 --> 02:49:01.419]  I think everybody's hysterical that somebody's going to DU us.
[02:49:01.739 --> 02:49:03.340]  We're DUing our troops every day.
[02:49:04.001 --> 02:49:06.223]  Israel DUed itself, hitting Lebanon with it.
[02:49:07.276 --> 02:49:08.097]  That's the thing, man.
[02:49:08.157 --> 02:49:09.339]  These globalists are nuts.
[02:49:10.099 --> 02:49:19.691]  You go to Bilderberg Rip, you see them drinking Diet Coke full of aspartame, you see them talking on cell phones, you see them smoking cigarettes, old men, old royalty just smoking cigarettes.
[02:49:20.872 --> 02:49:24.316]  They'll send their grandson off to fight in a war and have him breathe DU.
[02:49:24.617 --> 02:49:25.818]  They just don't care, man.
[02:49:25.858 --> 02:49:27.140]  These people are just nuts!
[02:49:30.353 --> 02:49:35.736]  I've talked to families whose sons and daughters are over there, and they go, yeah, I know DU's bad, but it's a good weapon.
[02:49:35.756 --> 02:49:38.378]  That's real funny!
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:43.021]  Because they're living one minute to the next, folks.
[02:49:43.061 --> 02:49:44.822]  They're not thinking about anything.
[02:49:45.502 --> 02:49:47.323]  There's no long-term strategic thinking.
[02:49:47.343 --> 02:49:47.924]  There's nothing.
[02:49:50.365 --> 02:49:51.606]  And so Israel comes out.
[02:49:52.677 --> 02:50:00.162]  It's in the London Independent, Times of London, but the reason you're hearing all this is because top Israeli officials said this over the weekend.
[02:50:02.223 --> 02:50:06.326]  Military strike is the only way to stop Iran, says top Israeli strategist.
[02:50:06.706 --> 02:50:14.611]  A top Israeli strategic analyst says armed forces is the only way to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons if the international community does not impose effective sanctions.
[02:50:15.631 --> 02:50:16.132]  The ZV
[02:50:17.382 --> 02:50:30.667]  Shetouber, director of the Tel Aviv University Institute for National Security Studies, was speaking last night after the Foreign Ministry denied a report in the Sunday Times that Israeli pilots were already training to strike three targets with low-yield nuclear weapons.
[02:50:31.448 --> 02:50:39.451]  Mark Regev, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Israel was focusing on giving full support to diplomatic actions and the implementation of a U.N.
[02:50:39.471 --> 02:50:42.832]  Security Council resolution imposing limited sanctions on Tehran.
[02:50:45.743 --> 02:50:50.807]  And again, the average American hears the headline, sees the headline, Iran goes nuclear.
[02:50:51.508 --> 02:50:53.049]  Peaceful nuclear weapons.
[02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:54.991]  Conservatively.
[02:50:56.432 --> 02:50:57.413]  Five years away.
[02:51:00.856 --> 02:51:02.557]  Five to nine, depending on which assessment.
[02:51:04.058 --> 02:51:08.682]  And hell, Pakistan's running around with a whole bunch of nukes and medium-range missiles.
[02:51:11.845 --> 02:51:12.826]  Nobody's worried about that.
[02:51:16.036 --> 02:51:18.700]  No, just Iran's an archenemy of Israel.
[02:51:19.761 --> 02:51:21.304]  And so it's going to get blown off the map.
[02:51:22.445 --> 02:51:24.147]  And boy, is the economy going to tank.
[02:51:25.069 --> 02:51:25.870]  We'll be right back.
[02:51:25.910 --> 02:51:27.873]  I'll get into a little bit more on this.
[02:51:27.893 --> 02:51:28.594]  I'll take a few calls.
[02:51:33.087 --> 02:51:36.273]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:51:36.613 --> 02:51:38.536]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:38.917 --> 02:51:46.570]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.259 --> 02:51:54.322]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.702 --> 02:52:06.107]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.447 --> 02:52:09.949]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:10.409 --> 02:52:12.330]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:16.492]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:54:29.613 --> 02:54:31.753]  Big John.
[02:54:32.493 --> 02:54:35.674]  Big John.
[02:54:35.694 --> 02:54:38.254]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[02:54:38.294 --> 02:54:41.115]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[02:54:41.155 --> 02:54:43.915]  Kind of broad at the shoulders and narrow at the hips.
[02:54:43.975 --> 02:54:47.296]  And everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John.
[02:54:56.349 --> 02:55:02.932]  Look, in the past, Americans especially knew that people wanted to scam you, wanted to enslave you, wanted to dominate you.
[02:55:03.873 --> 02:55:14.358]  And now, we just after World War II, we decided we were the good guys, and the government was good, and it could do no wrong, and we got taken for a ride, and they, these elites owned really fancy public relations firms,
[02:55:15.097 --> 02:55:20.541]  They'll have, you know, people pay millions of dollars a year just to come up with names of stuff and how to twist things.
[02:55:22.862 --> 02:55:27.225]  And it's just sick to see people so conned.
[02:55:29.907 --> 02:55:36.351]  And to think that they lied to us into war with Iraq, claiming they had weapons of mass destruction.
[02:55:38.612 --> 02:55:41.134]  And now they're going to lie us into war with Iran.
[02:55:42.105 --> 02:55:43.887]  And of course I'm not saying Iran's perfect.
[02:55:44.227 --> 02:55:45.308]  Humanity is evil.
[02:55:45.808 --> 02:55:50.332]  Leaders are always more evil, or almost always more evil, than their populations.
[02:55:51.353 --> 02:55:53.214]  But I'm totally against attacking Iran.
[02:55:55.856 --> 02:55:59.039]  I'm just so tired of hearing how Israel's our best buddy.
[02:55:59.619 --> 02:56:01.521]  Israel's totally controlled by the globalists.
[02:56:03.507 --> 02:56:12.511]  Look, there is no Israel, there is no U.S., there is no... All of these western countries are controlled by the Global Crime Syndicate, by the big central banks.
[02:56:13.291 --> 02:56:19.253]  Anything they do is simply one step towards knocking out any other sovereign nations.
[02:56:22.074 --> 02:56:30.998]  The U.S., England, Israel, they're all used as engines to expand this global empire.
[02:56:34.013 --> 02:56:36.934]  And that's why David Rockefeller and the rest of them call it the New World Order.
[02:56:36.954 --> 02:56:38.974]  That's why we say we fight the New World Order.
[02:56:38.994 --> 02:56:40.274]  That's their name for it.
[02:56:42.875 --> 02:56:43.495]  Here's another one.
[02:56:43.515 --> 02:56:45.736]  The Israeli divulge his plan to nuke Iran.
[02:56:46.616 --> 02:56:47.236]  Not to worry.
[02:56:47.296 --> 02:56:56.818]  The many nukes Israel will use against Iran's facility and the heavy water reactor would each have a force equivalent to one-fifteenth of the Hiroshima bomb.
[02:56:57.158 --> 02:57:01.079]  Thus, we should not worry about the downwinders, mostly Iranians.
[02:57:02.719 --> 02:57:12.342]  Two Israeli Air Force squadrons are trying to blow up an Iranian facility using low-yield nuclear bunker busters, according to several Israeli military sourcers reports the Sunday Times.
[02:57:12.802 --> 02:57:19.885]  The attack will be the first with nuclear weapons since 1945, when the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[02:57:23.546 --> 02:57:24.126]  Oh, man.
[02:57:24.146 --> 02:57:32.149]  And of course, that'll just further demonize America in the eyes of the world and make more countries dump the dollar.
[02:57:34.022 --> 02:57:35.522]  So your money will be worth even less?
[02:57:40.203 --> 02:57:45.844]  I mean, China, their head general threatened last year to nuke every major US city.
[02:57:45.864 --> 02:57:47.005]  He had a press conference.
[02:57:47.625 --> 02:57:49.945]  And our media is all, China's our friend.
[02:57:50.485 --> 02:57:51.806]  North Korea threatening to nuke us.
[02:57:52.366 --> 02:57:53.086]  Pakistan.
[02:57:54.326 --> 02:57:55.186]  Over 20 nukes.
[02:57:55.326 --> 02:57:56.847]  Delivery system's not a problem.
[02:57:57.207 --> 02:57:57.727]  Iran.
[02:57:57.747 --> 02:58:03.088]  And it's all the things our government's done to them.
[02:58:03.740 --> 02:58:08.041]  But again, the average person can't find it on a map, doesn't know what we've done to Iran.
[02:58:08.461 --> 02:58:09.401]  It's horrible!
[02:58:09.901 --> 02:58:11.622]  No wonder they hate us so much!
[02:58:12.802 --> 02:58:16.903]  This is like somebody we've been stomping on in a ditch, who's trying to crawl up.
[02:58:16.943 --> 02:58:18.403]  We're going, look, he's crawling up!
[02:58:18.463 --> 02:58:19.024]  He's evil!
[02:58:21.224 --> 02:58:22.164]  It's just incredible.
[02:58:22.184 --> 02:58:22.744]  I'm out of time.
[02:58:22.764 --> 02:58:23.605]  Sorry to the callers.
[02:58:23.805 --> 02:58:25.085]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[02:58:25.105 --> 02:58:27.506]  I've got some big guests lined up this week.
[02:58:28.506 --> 02:58:29.046]  And, uh...
[02:58:33.527 --> 02:58:35.288]  We're gonna continue to fight the New World Order.
[02:58:36.228 --> 02:58:38.389]  I just get frustrated seeing them scam people.
[02:58:39.229 --> 02:58:41.070]  I wish they didn't get away with it so much.
[02:58:41.130 --> 02:58:43.992]  I wish people knew how they were being manipulated.
[02:58:44.992 --> 02:58:48.634]  I mean, the level of just... Look, the government's totally corrupt.
[02:58:48.954 --> 02:58:49.854]  Totally corrupt.
[02:58:50.194 --> 02:58:52.595]  The corporations that control it are totally corrupt.
[02:58:53.776 --> 02:58:55.056]  And heaven help us.
[02:58:55.897 --> 02:58:58.338]  Heaven help us, because, man, they just get hungrier.
[02:58:58.978 --> 02:59:01.199]  The bigger they get, the more they gotta consume.
[02:59:02.344 --> 02:59:04.747]  And they want to put us all in prison, sterilize us?
[02:59:05.248 --> 02:59:06.330]  These are some bad people.
[02:59:06.590 --> 02:59:07.111]  God bless!
