[00:00:05.403 --> 00:00:06.023]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.704 --> 00:00:07.764]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.465 --> 00:00:09.586]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:11.047]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:12.768]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.052]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:21.656]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.225 --> 00:00:33.666]  We're good to go.
[00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:07.168]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.250]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.812]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:01:19.592 --> 00:01:22.513]  And they whisper the word, Alex.
[00:01:24.754 --> 00:01:28.695]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:44.201]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[00:01:47.604 --> 00:01:57.032]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:04.725]  It's been so many years, so many tears.
[00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:10.291]  We have lost once before, now we'll settle the score.
[00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:29.415]  Watch and wait.
[00:02:29.696 --> 00:02:31.497]  Get ready for the sign.
[00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:35.360]  There are many here among us who have not yet seen the light.
[00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.140]  Roll it!
[00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:22.221]  In the last two days, multiple daring raids have been launched into the heart of the New World Order's operation.
[00:03:22.281 --> 00:03:24.061]  Luke Radowsky, Sabrina Rivera,
[00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:49.872]  Tom Foti, and I know all three, reporting for InfoWars.com, snuck into the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:03:51.072 --> 00:03:51.993]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:03:52.093 --> 00:03:53.213]  They're coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.454]  We'll break it down for you.
[00:03:55.014 --> 00:04:01.637]  They confronted David Rockefeller at his house, with his bodyguards having an absolute meltdown.
[00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.932]  They confronted Rudolph Giuliani with a victim of 9-11, with a family member of a victim of 9-11.
[00:04:09.712 --> 00:04:13.274]  And they confronted Al Gore on 9-11.
[00:04:14.154 --> 00:04:18.515]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:04:22.777 --> 00:04:25.078]  And they're joining us coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:29.539]  We've got so much news, it just makes my head spin.
[00:04:29.679 --> 00:04:32.200]  I just heard Tony Snow about 30 minutes ago.
[00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.230]  On the air with Neil Bortz lying.
[00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.411]  He literally spewed for 15 minutes.
[00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:41.071]  Pure lies about the amnesty plan.
[00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:43.912]  They are definitely making their move.
[00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.652]  I've never seen them make a move like this.
[00:04:46.712 --> 00:04:48.393]  They gotta break the country's back.
[00:04:48.873 --> 00:04:49.953]  And they gotta do it now.
[00:04:50.973 --> 00:04:52.133]  And they're sounding desperate.
[00:04:52.153 --> 00:04:54.734]  They're out there having to really push hard.
[00:04:56.194 --> 00:04:57.074]  I smell blood.
[00:04:57.134 --> 00:04:57.794]  What about you?
[00:04:58.875 --> 00:04:59.915]  Let's go for the throat.
[00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:00.835]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:07.334]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:09.597]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.977 --> 00:05:17.585]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.297 --> 00:05:25.361]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:37.167]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.487 --> 00:05:40.989]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:43.410]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.572]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:02.665 --> 00:07:06.787]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.008 --> 00:07:08.769]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:15.332]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.613 --> 00:07:21.736]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.996 --> 00:07:28.020]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.703]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:07:34.863 --> 00:07:38.404]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.

[00:07:45.267 --> 00:07:46.308]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:50.752]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[00:08:02.009 --> 00:08:04.111]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:13.518]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.938 --> 00:08:17.721]  Well, I was supposedly told on Friday, but I guess I missed the message.
[00:08:17.781 --> 00:08:21.344]  I get so busy up here at the office that Ron Paul is on this Thursday.
[00:08:21.784 --> 00:08:25.607]  He had to reschedule because of scheduling conflicts, but he is on for 30 minutes.
[00:08:26.247 --> 00:08:28.309]  Coming up in just a couple days.
[00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:33.714]  Jim Tucker will also be joining us from Istanbul on Thursday.
[00:08:33.734 --> 00:08:39.097]  They believe they have learned the location of the Bilderberg Conference.
[00:08:40.337 --> 00:08:43.259]  This will be, what, the 53rd Bilderberg Conference.
[00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.520]  Tucker heads for Istanbul.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.041]  We've got his report out here.
[00:08:47.984 --> 00:08:55.587]  And they believe it's going to be at the Classis Hotel in the tiny town of Silivri, about 40 miles from Istanbul.
[00:08:55.607 --> 00:08:56.447]  They're going over that.
[00:08:56.888 --> 00:09:00.529]  Brits could be forced to give up meat, milk to fight global warming.
[00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:03.210]  See, it's going to be one-child policies and no meat.
[00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:05.991]  This is a total re-engineering of society.
[00:09:06.271 --> 00:09:08.372]  So they start with simple things like light bulbs.
[00:09:08.532 --> 00:09:09.272]  Sounds reasonable.
[00:09:09.953 --> 00:09:15.815]  And then it leads to one-child policies and finally euthanasia already going on quietly worldwide.
[00:09:17.308 --> 00:09:21.030]  Also, Iraqi refugees in dire straits turned to Syrian sex trade.
[00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:23.210]  Email tax coming.
[00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.691]  This time it isn't, I was telling you four, five, six years ago.
[00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:28.332]  And they would always deny it, even though they introduced legislation.
[00:09:28.632 --> 00:09:30.973]  This is the official email tax legislation.
[00:09:31.594 --> 00:09:34.535]  It will also, the New York Times says, end the internet.
[00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:39.777]  See, they're now preparing, they're now announcing their internet, too.
[00:09:40.117 --> 00:09:41.458]  It's now being announced.
[00:09:41.538 --> 00:09:43.098]  We'll be covering that for you.
[00:09:43.418 --> 00:09:45.139]  They're making the move, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:45.973 --> 00:09:47.594]  They're making their move right now.
[00:09:49.735 --> 00:09:51.735]  Liberty Attack, part of Grand Scheme.
[00:09:51.816 --> 00:09:53.476]  That's Mark Glenn, American Free Press.
[00:09:53.496 --> 00:09:54.197]  We'll be going over that.
[00:09:54.737 --> 00:09:57.038]  Unknown Drugs, used to persecute Falun Gong.
[00:09:57.418 --> 00:10:02.800]  They take you to the prison, they give you a shot that paralyzes you, and then they just turn you over to your family.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.621]  That's your punishment.
[00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:09.043]  It's a new way of... and it also punishes the community that then has to take care of you.
[00:10:09.625 --> 00:10:12.146]  It's all part of the weapons operations they're launching.
[00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:13.886]  Of course, China is the global model.
[00:10:13.906 --> 00:10:15.606]  You can look forward to similar activities here.
[00:10:15.987 --> 00:10:21.828]  It's a huge admitted laboratory, as is Singapore, of domination and control and surveillance.
[00:10:21.848 --> 00:10:23.008]  That's why they're our good buddies.
[00:10:24.409 --> 00:10:27.950]  Fury as 90,000 police officers caught speeding or let off.
[00:10:29.090 --> 00:10:33.471]  Mexican mob boos Miss America, chant Mexico.
[00:10:35.812 --> 00:10:39.455]  And this is shades of chanting Pro Bin Laden slogans.
[00:10:40.496 --> 00:10:46.600]  Jane Stanley, remember her from BBC reporting that Building 7 had fallen long before it did?
[00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:56.208]  A college student got her on the telephone, and we'll be playing that later, and she got very upset when they asked about who told her it was going to fall down.
[00:10:56.228 --> 00:11:04.314]  You can hear her suck in some breath, you can hear the adrenaline course through her veins, because she's been told, you better keep your mouth shut, little lady, or
[00:11:05.345 --> 00:11:06.765]  Things aren't going to go too well.
[00:11:07.086 --> 00:11:07.926]  You can hear the fear.
[00:11:08.566 --> 00:11:09.746]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:11:09.866 --> 00:11:13.948]  Also, the United States government uses Al-Qaeda to attack Iran.
[00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:18.049]  This came out over the weekend publicly, but it got little to no attention.
[00:11:18.089 --> 00:11:24.131]  Paul Watson wrote an article yesterday on PrisonPlanet.com that we'll be covering as well.
[00:11:25.521 --> 00:11:45.948]  I was going to have the Illinois Rifle Association on in about 15 minutes, but because they've got open, massive attacks on the Second Amendment there, we're going to move them back to later, because again, Luke Rudowsky, Sabrina Rivera, and Tom Foti reporting for InfoWars.com.
[00:11:47.208 --> 00:11:53.210]  I was a weekend, and of course Luke had been trying to call me all weekend, but I didn't check my cell phone.
[00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.214]  I didn't check my office phones.
[00:11:55.234 --> 00:11:56.115]  I really need to.
[00:11:56.135 --> 00:12:02.219]  I had everybody from Charlie Sheen to Luke Rudowsky trying to contact me.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.421]  We'll talk about the Charlie Sheen stuff later too.
[00:12:05.422 --> 00:12:06.803]  I'm literally my head spinning.
[00:12:07.123 --> 00:12:08.704]  There's no way to cover all this anymore.
[00:12:08.985 --> 00:12:11.206]  By the way, I just covered a small part of the stack.
[00:12:11.987 --> 00:12:13.168]  That is a two inch stack.
[00:12:13.188 --> 00:12:16.070]  There is literally a six or seven inch stack sitting in front of me.
[00:12:17.871 --> 00:12:19.773]  Each story we could spend three hours on.
[00:12:19.953 --> 00:12:21.074]  Literally it makes me have a
[00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:23.999]  It's like an excited headache, though.
[00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:25.139]  It's not even a painful headache.
[00:12:25.159 --> 00:12:30.262]  It's like my brain is burning effusively with the desire to expose all of this.
[00:12:31.102 --> 00:12:41.627]  But Luke Rudowsky and his crew, his team, his cohorts, his friends, his comrades, what's the right word?
[00:12:41.687 --> 00:12:42.547]  His collaborators?
[00:12:44.208 --> 00:12:47.690]  They were able to confront Lord Rockefeller, David Rockefeller,
[00:12:48.741 --> 00:12:56.943]  At his home, they were able to infiltrate the sanctuary of the Council on Foreign Relations, the British command base on Pratt Street at Pratt House.
[00:12:57.663 --> 00:13:00.604]  They were able to confront Al Gore and Rudolph Giuliani this weekend.
[00:13:01.324 --> 00:13:16.908]  I mean, they are on a streak here, literally in the enemy's camp in the capital of the United States, New York City, the true capital, one of the triple crown capitals of the New World Order, one of the Three Horns.
[00:13:19.764 --> 00:13:21.985]  Paris, London, and New York, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:22.205 --> 00:13:22.986]  Make no mistake.
[00:13:24.907 --> 00:13:29.730]  And, uh, those are the true capitals of the New World Order.
[00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:40.536]  They have their subsidiaries and auxiliaries, but some would say it was Jerusalem, others would say it was Tel Aviv, others would say it was Moscow, or Beijing, or Peking, or Tokyo.
[00:13:41.256 --> 00:13:41.517]  No.
[00:13:42.077 --> 00:13:42.317]  No.
[00:13:42.977 --> 00:13:44.298]  It's New York, London.
[00:13:46.579 --> 00:13:49.141]  New York, London, and Paris, Paris.
[00:13:50.737 --> 00:13:52.358]  This is off the charts now.
[00:13:52.918 --> 00:13:56.719]  Luke is not going to upload this video yet because he's on a streak.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.780]  He's on a mad jag.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:00.961]  A foray.
[00:14:00.981 --> 00:14:06.423]  A raid, as they call it.
[00:14:07.663 --> 00:14:11.965]  And Giuliani is speaking again today, so they're going to try to call out the troops.
[00:14:12.045 --> 00:14:17.587]  That's you listening in the New York or New Jersey areas.
[00:14:19.273 --> 00:14:28.627]  Newark or New York or any of the surrounding areas, you need to, when Luke joins us coming up in about 10-15 minutes, you need to get ready.
[00:14:28.707 --> 00:14:29.408]  Saddle up!
[00:14:30.347 --> 00:14:34.590]  Because they'll probably try to stop him, but they won't be able to stop everybody from getting in to confront Giuliani again.
[00:14:34.851 --> 00:14:48.922]  It's important to hit them over and over and over again, repeatedly, physically, letting them know they're not God, letting them know they're not in ivory towers, letting them know what they already know, that they're not invincible, that their illusion is crumbling.
[00:14:49.302 --> 00:14:57.349]  By the way, Giuliani gasped with fear, I'm told, and couldn't even speak when he was confronted at point-blank range.
[00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.811]  David Rockefeller's
[00:15:00.939 --> 00:15:08.444]  Bodyguards, the descriptions I've been told this is going to be some extremely powerful video to be uploaded to YouTube.
[00:15:08.884 --> 00:15:19.831]  I would upload, I haven't seen the footage, but I would upload Rockefeller first, then Giuliani, then Al Gore, and yes they've got footage of where they stormed
[00:15:21.538 --> 00:15:32.121]  They actually slipped in, and the door was open, you know, fuzzily public offices there on the ground floor, into the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:15:36.283 --> 00:15:43.005]  Absolutely amazing, and the freelance reporter reporting for Infowars.com, Luke Rudowsky, is just doing a great job.
[00:15:45.225 --> 00:15:48.766]  Absolutely amazing, so exciting to see young people taking action.
[00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.927]  Luke's 21 years old, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:52.515 --> 00:15:55.617]  I got into this fight when I was 20, and Luke got into it when he was 19.
[00:15:56.577 --> 00:15:57.718]  And guess what woke him up?
[00:15:57.798 --> 00:16:02.061]  That's one of the things I'm really proud of in my life, is that's what I'm here to do.
[00:16:02.081 --> 00:16:04.682]  That's what I've been telling you for over 10 years, and I really realize this.
[00:16:05.563 --> 00:16:08.204]  My job is to wake people up.
[00:16:09.645 --> 00:16:12.106]  My job is to call on the faithful.
[00:16:12.186 --> 00:16:18.090]  My job is to plant seeds and reach out to others to take action and to be leaders.
[00:16:20.524 --> 00:16:23.026]  One person called in one time and said, You're a prophet!
[00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.327]  You're going to save us!
[00:16:24.887 --> 00:16:26.588]  No, it's the opposite, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:27.429 --> 00:16:31.692]  I mean, if you want to liken me to prophets, then liken me, and I don't mean this literally.
[00:16:31.712 --> 00:16:34.814]  I mean, this is an analogy to John the Baptist.
[00:16:35.114 --> 00:16:38.076]  I'm calling for others to come.
[00:16:38.617 --> 00:16:47.643]  I'm here, literally, if need be, to put my head on the chopping block to get more people activated and to take action.
[00:16:48.624 --> 00:16:50.085]  And if you want to know where the solution
[00:16:50.775 --> 00:16:52.015]  is defining the New World Order.
[00:16:52.555 --> 00:17:06.279]  You need to only look in the mirror, because that's where the fall of this nation lies, it's where the rise of this nation lies, it's where our entire future is held, is in your soul, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:12.360]  In the seat of your consciousness does lie the seed of the universe.
[00:17:14.941 --> 00:17:16.381]  As a great philosopher once said,
[00:17:17.572 --> 00:17:24.734]  And so I ask you out there to activate the unlimited potential that is within you.
[00:17:24.754 --> 00:17:27.095]  And that's what this broadcast is for.
[00:17:27.135 --> 00:17:30.796]  It is here simply to magnify the great works of others.
[00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:35.577]  It is simply a focus point or a crossroads.
[00:17:36.757 --> 00:17:46.180]  It is a place where I try to energize and try to expand and amplify what you are doing.
[00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:54.643]  And as long as I am presented with an open hand, this broadcast is open to everyone.
[00:17:57.644 --> 00:18:00.826]  It is not open to those in this movement that are in it for the wrong reasons.
[00:18:02.286 --> 00:18:03.887]  And sadly, too many are.
[00:18:03.907 --> 00:18:07.748]  And that's why they never have real success in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:18:08.168 --> 00:18:13.950]  It is a true heart that is able to face the dragon of the New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.070]  It is the true heart.
[00:18:16.431 --> 00:18:35.736]  That doesn't mean we're perfect or we're angelic or we are spotless, far from it, but it is the true heart filled and buoyed with courage and the light of God that is able to stand forth against our enemies and they quake in fear as if we are thousand-foot giants.
[00:18:36.897 --> 00:18:41.338]  And if you could only experience the fear in their eyes
[00:18:42.362 --> 00:19:00.595]  At the gleam of righteousness in your eyes, when you stand up for the weak and the infirm, when you stand up for the third world, when you stand up against the New World Order and let them know that you are aware of all of their crimes, they shake to their very foundations!
[00:19:02.643 --> 00:19:09.687]  It's a put-on, it's an act that they tell you you can't beat City Hall, you can't fight City Hall, you can't affect change, you don't have power.
[00:19:10.207 --> 00:19:25.235]  They know that the tidal forces of humanity, and our species, and our forebearers, and our ancestors, in long line, stand behind us.
[00:19:27.208 --> 00:19:34.210]  And they know that the love of our families, and our women, and our children, beat in our breast.
[00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:41.513]  It is a force, once unleashed, that will sweep the globe!
[00:19:43.773 --> 00:19:55.457]  We shall return with Tony Snow attempting to turn the drawbridge wheel, to open the gates, to overrun the nation,
[00:19:56.687 --> 00:19:58.208]  They are making their move!
[00:19:59.029 --> 00:20:00.790]  We must engage them now!
[00:20:02.311 --> 00:20:04.393]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.013 --> 00:20:13.940]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:21.586]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.299 --> 00:20:27.804]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.284 --> 00:20:39.133]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:39.873 --> 00:20:41.955]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.435 --> 00:20:43.877]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:48.421 --> 00:20:50.905]  Or, visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:50.985 --> 00:20:51.466]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:01.132 --> 00:21:01.592]  Gold.
[00:21:01.933 --> 00:21:03.214]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.474 --> 00:21:09.558]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:09.738 --> 00:21:13.561]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:13.922 --> 00:21:15.803]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:15.843 --> 00:21:18.165]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.305 --> 00:21:25.070]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker
[00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:26.290]  We're good to go.
[00:21:48.677 --> 00:21:49.077]  We're good to go.
[00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:10.739]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:22:10.979 --> 00:22:22.229]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:22:22.569 --> 00:22:27.394]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum
[00:22:27.614 --> 00:22:27.774]  I think?
[00:22:46.425 --> 00:22:48.247]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:22:48.287 --> 00:22:49.148]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.188 --> 00:22:49.548]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:50.949]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:23:00.709 --> 00:23:05.012]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news.
[00:23:05.212 --> 00:23:07.893]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[00:23:08.073 --> 00:23:10.475]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[00:23:10.695 --> 00:23:17.579]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[00:23:17.739 --> 00:23:18.859]  What does this mean in the garden?
[00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:21.561]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers,
[00:23:21.581 --> 00:23:22.161]  We're good to go!
[00:23:46.361 --> 00:23:48.001]  Alright, this broadcast will be extremely important today.
[00:23:48.061 --> 00:23:49.242]  I've never seen so much news.
[00:23:49.362 --> 00:23:50.822]  It's all completely out of control.
[00:23:50.842 --> 00:23:51.382]  Stay with us.
[00:24:15.566 --> 00:24:32.926]  You know I think the best way to get into Tony Snow and what I heard him doing today and how they're pulling out every stop to try to get amnesty through and break the back of America including just unbelievable congenital
[00:24:33.675 --> 00:24:34.015]  U.S.A.
[00:25:18.763 --> 00:25:34.177]  Okay, next is USA.
[00:25:34.457 --> 00:25:34.798]  Hello.
[00:25:34.858 --> 00:25:35.158]  Yes.
[00:25:35.238 --> 00:25:35.719]  Okay.
[00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:40.303]  She has selected judge number one, Tony Romo.
[00:25:40.463 --> 00:25:41.384]  Your question, please.
[00:25:45.569 --> 00:25:51.027]  If you could go back and relive one moment in your life, what moment would you pick and why?
[00:25:53.164 --> 00:26:01.946]  I would have to say I would go back to January of 2007 when I traveled to South Africa to volunteer at the Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa.
[00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:10.188]  I'm very passionate about education and being there in South Africa just sparked my interest even more for education and all that I can do for that.
[00:26:10.708 --> 00:26:11.928]  So that's where I would go.
[00:26:11.948 --> 00:26:13.168]  I would go back to South Africa.
[00:26:13.188 --> 00:26:14.388]  Alright, let's go ahead and stop.
[00:26:14.408 --> 00:26:15.609]  The booing goes on and on.
[00:26:16.469 --> 00:26:21.390]  By the way, I went and pulled up some other clips this morning and it of course turns out that
[00:26:22.461 --> 00:26:23.722]  They were not booing the other people.
[00:26:24.322 --> 00:26:31.908]  It was the United States, and it needed to be booed, and then they boo her while she talks about going to South Africa.
[00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:36.872]  Giving, of course, the proper politically correct comment.
[00:26:36.952 --> 00:26:43.818]  And right after 9-11, they were chanting Osama Bin Laden and holding up his pictures at a soccer game for the U.S.
[00:26:43.838 --> 00:26:45.479]  versus Mexico.
[00:26:47.603 --> 00:26:50.164]  And my point is, is let's stop lying about this.
[00:26:50.264 --> 00:26:52.865]  Let's not be so politically correct that we're not supposed to talk about it.
[00:26:53.405 --> 00:27:01.768]  I mean, you go to one of these illegal alien parades, or even go to a Desi Sace parade, and about half the people are shouting, Viva La Raza, down with America, Mexico, Mexico, Mexico!
[00:27:02.388 --> 00:27:09.331]  And I got it on video, right here in Austin, and I got police beating up anybody that protested them, and putting them in paddy wagons.
[00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:13.712]  I mean, by the way, American citizens aren't, and I just want to tell the illegal aliens something.
[00:27:14.113 --> 00:27:15.173]  I mean, if they're listening to this show.
[00:27:15.948 --> 00:27:19.910]  Why do you think the man, you know, New York powered banks are behind this?
[00:27:20.531 --> 00:27:25.453]  It's about bringing down America so we can all be slaves just like you are in Mexico and North Korea.
[00:27:26.574 --> 00:27:28.155]  There's nowhere to run when the U.S.
[00:27:28.195 --> 00:27:28.595]  falls.
[00:27:30.036 --> 00:27:35.959]  And I was driving to work listening to Tony Snow, the White House Press Secretary, and this guy's dying of cancer right now.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:40.682]  And he's still eloquently lying though, right into the grave.
[00:27:41.747 --> 00:27:45.650]  And there he was, I mean, spewing pure lies for 10-15 minutes.
[00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:55.857]  I was driving down the road with my mouth hanging open, because I knew what the next lie would be after the next lie, and Neil Bortz was putting on a halfway fight against it, kind of sandbagging.
[00:27:55.877 --> 00:27:58.438]  He was kind of, you know, acting like he was having a boxing match.
[00:27:59.779 --> 00:28:07.425]  And I had a bad feeling, and I switched to the next big national talk station carrying national talk, and there was another White House operative on there.
[00:28:07.445 --> 00:28:08.725]  I had another bad feeling.
[00:28:08.786 --> 00:28:09.446]  I switched channels.
[00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.627]  It was another top neocon.
[00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:18.053]  Right now, they're on every conservative talk station in the country injecting pure cyanide into America.
[00:28:18.653 --> 00:28:19.914]  And that's what Mexico is.
[00:28:20.014 --> 00:28:23.755]  It's a big injection of pure poison into America.
[00:28:23.775 --> 00:28:28.556]  Now, I mean, look, if they were driving down the wages and wrecking the economy, that'd be one thing.
[00:28:28.596 --> 00:28:34.437]  And, you know, on average, getting right at triple the amount of welfare and services they actually pay in taxes.
[00:28:34.597 --> 00:28:36.017]  You know, the lie that they're contributing.
[00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:39.018]  I kind of still not have as big a problem.
[00:28:41.531 --> 00:28:47.396]  But it's the fact that they're running around with Mexican flags, saying down with America, it makes me really, really angry!
[00:28:48.036 --> 00:28:58.185]  And then on top of that, I gotta hear that piece of trash, that fake conservative up there posing, that Benedict Arnold, that Judas goat.
[00:29:01.067 --> 00:29:04.370]  I mean, they got Dick Cheney on Limbaugh pushing the amnesty.
[00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.131]  I mean, they're out in force.
[00:29:06.772 --> 00:29:08.253]  I heard them a few weeks ago on there pushing it.
[00:29:09.228 --> 00:29:12.169]  And I've never seen them come out like this, and the Democrats.
[00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:16.251]  And, uh, Borch did call him on using Ted Kennedy lines.
[00:29:17.692 --> 00:29:21.274]  He was using Ted Kennedy lines of, we need to get these people out of the shadows.
[00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:25.836]  Folks, they're not out, they're not in the shadows, they're running around, screaming, Viva Mexico!
[00:29:26.116 --> 00:29:27.156]  Viva La Raza!
[00:29:28.837 --> 00:29:29.897]  Down with America!
[00:29:30.978 --> 00:29:37.661]  And these poor people don't understand that they got the most powerful friends in the world!
[00:29:38.982 --> 00:29:44.004]  Why do they think the man, the Patron, is giving them full power?
[00:29:45.705 --> 00:29:47.386]  You are empowered by the Beast!
[00:29:47.966 --> 00:29:49.807]  You're actually empowered by the Antichrist!
[00:29:51.208 --> 00:29:52.148]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.608 --> 00:29:54.209]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:57.831]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:04.917 --> 00:32:08.318]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:08.478 --> 00:32:11.999]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:15.501]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:15.521 --> 00:32:20.883]  This basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.323 --> 00:32:21.924]  We're good to go.
[00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:42.482]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:32:42.542 --> 00:32:43.922]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:32:44.082 --> 00:32:47.544]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:47.564 --> 00:32:48.565]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:07.962 --> 00:33:11.425]  Look at your young men fighting.
[00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:13.106]  Look at your women crying.
[00:33:13.227 --> 00:33:17.451]  Look at your young men dying.
[00:33:17.611 --> 00:33:21.454]  The way they've always done before.
[00:33:32.567 --> 00:33:48.881]  Look at the hate we're breeding Look at the fear we're feeding Look at the lives we're leading The way we've always done before
[00:34:24.042 --> 00:34:24.622]  Welcome back.
[00:34:24.682 --> 00:34:27.224]  There is a civil war going on in the United States.
[00:34:27.384 --> 00:34:46.714]  We are the counter-revolutionaries countering the British command arms that took over the Federal Reserve in 1913 and set up their command base for the political control of the Congress and the executive and legislative judicial with the Council on Foreign Relations at Pratt House.
[00:34:47.757 --> 00:34:57.405]  We are joined by Infowars.com field reporter Luke Rudowsky, Sabrina Rivera, working with him for Infowars.com, Tom Foley, who I know well.
[00:34:57.805 --> 00:35:03.570]  You'll see him in many photos and videos holding up the 9-11 inside job sign for four or five years out at Ground Zero.
[00:35:04.531 --> 00:35:05.752]  So many other people.
[00:35:06.907 --> 00:35:07.867]  Matt and others were there.
[00:35:08.168 --> 00:35:11.869]  I don't know where to start, so I want the basics to be given to us by Luke Rodowsky.
[00:35:11.889 --> 00:35:15.270]  We'll get a big article out on this at PrisonPlanet.com in the next few hours.
[00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:17.571]  Then he's going to still confront Giuliani today.
[00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:19.452]  He wants you to be there, confront Giuliani again.
[00:35:19.472 --> 00:35:22.113]  Then he's going to come back tonight, upload these to YouTube.
[00:35:22.313 --> 00:35:25.294]  We'll then integrate those at probably around 10 o'clock at night or so.
[00:35:26.594 --> 00:35:26.974]  We're good to go!
[00:35:50.612 --> 00:35:52.113]  And he's been in this fight a couple years.
[00:35:52.153 --> 00:35:54.375]  He woke up when he saw Police State 2000.
[00:35:54.795 --> 00:35:56.796]  And again, that's one of the things I am proud of.
[00:35:57.237 --> 00:35:58.537]  I'm not proud of a nice car.
[00:35:58.557 --> 00:35:59.878]  I'm not proud of a big house.
[00:35:59.918 --> 00:36:01.179]  I'm not proud of my muscles.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:05.482]  I'm not proud of, you know, I'm proud of my wife.
[00:36:05.562 --> 00:36:06.603]  I'm proud of my children.
[00:36:07.023 --> 00:36:08.544]  I'm proud of the good things I've done.
[00:36:08.684 --> 00:36:13.868]  I'm proud of the old ladies I've helped across the street or help with their groceries or help when their dog gets out.
[00:36:14.328 --> 00:36:15.269]  I'm proud of the bullies.
[00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:22.351]  I don't mean to talk like that.
[00:36:22.371 --> 00:36:24.372]  I'm just getting real on this show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:24.792 --> 00:36:28.613]  I'm proud of the time two or three guys tried to take me down and I literally sent them to the hospital.
[00:36:29.173 --> 00:36:32.214]  I'm proud of my forefathers that stood up against tyranny.
[00:36:32.254 --> 00:36:35.895]  I'm proud of my forefathers that died at the Alamo and fought at San Jacinto.
[00:36:36.395 --> 00:36:41.239]  And I'm telling you, I am proud of all of you out there and your forebears that stood up against tyranny.
[00:36:41.519 --> 00:36:46.703]  And I'm proud of Luke Radowsky and the things that he's done and the things that his friends have done.
[00:36:46.723 --> 00:36:49.706]  They are brothers and sisters forever!
[00:36:50.305 --> 00:37:06.981]  And the death threats they've gone through, and everything they've done in the heart of the beast, in the capital of the New World Order, in one of the triple capitals of the New World Order, there in New York City, and everything they've gone through, and Silverstein thugs threatening to claim they had bombs on them, to send them to jail.
[00:37:07.958 --> 00:37:08.578]  Yeah, man, no problem.
[00:37:08.598 --> 00:37:09.439]  Good to have you on there.
[00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:12.721]  And don't forget, John Edwards and the President of the CFR, Richard Haas.
[00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:14.602]  Man, it's been a crazy week.
[00:37:15.023 --> 00:37:19.105]  The last seven days, I mean, we hit all these people up, last seven days.
[00:37:19.385 --> 00:37:21.147]  And the videos are going to be coming out soon.
[00:37:36.229 --> 00:37:37.410]  We do a lot of great stuff.
[00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:41.812]  I'm telling you right now, just what we did to Giuliani today is going to send a message to everybody.
[00:37:42.412 --> 00:37:43.773]  And we have a great team here.
[00:37:43.813 --> 00:37:52.238]  We have, you know, Tom Foti, Sabrina, my friend Matt, even Cosmos was out here from TruthAction.org last week, and we've been doing a lot of great work out here, man.
[00:37:52.278 --> 00:37:52.698]  I'm telling you.
[00:37:53.877 --> 00:37:55.078]  Absolutely, my friend.
[00:37:55.438 --> 00:37:56.019]  Break it down.
[00:37:56.039 --> 00:38:04.824]  We're going to put Tom Foti, extremely intelligent and articulate, expert on the New World Order, and Sabrina Rivera, who I've had the pleasure to meet, I remember, but I don't know her too well.
[00:38:05.065 --> 00:38:10.288]  Really glad that they've now gotten into the Infowars team and are there with you, Luke, side by side.
[00:38:10.608 --> 00:38:11.249]  Break it down.
[00:38:12.430 --> 00:38:18.157]  Who you confronted first, how it all started, and then the infiltration of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:38:18.878 --> 00:38:20.140]  It's very interesting.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:24.786]  Last Tuesday we went by David Rockefeller's house here in New York City on the Upper West Side.
[00:38:25.353 --> 00:38:26.434]  And we went by his house.
[00:38:26.514 --> 00:38:35.260]  You guys have kept this quiet because you didn't want him to come after the video, but at the same time, my God, next time you do this, I've got to know quicker, Luke.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:39.783]  I know you keep it under your hat to kind of have a streak, but it's safer to get it out public, but go ahead.
[00:38:39.883 --> 00:38:40.864]  Yeah, I'm trying to call you guys.
[00:38:40.924 --> 00:38:41.805]  I'm really trying to get in touch.
[00:38:42.145 --> 00:38:44.086]  You haven't been able to get in touch with us since Tuesday?
[00:38:44.386 --> 00:38:45.467]  Yeah, I've been trying to call you guys.
[00:38:45.487 --> 00:38:46.328]  I don't know what's been going on.
[00:38:46.448 --> 00:38:53.072]  Well, the problem is we're getting 500 phone calls a day, but we're going to give you a special extension, and we're going to start checking the phones here.
[00:38:53.092 --> 00:38:53.833]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:38:54.213 --> 00:38:54.353]  Right.
[00:38:54.593 --> 00:38:56.894]  Yeah, Tuesday we went in front of David Rockefeller's house.
[00:38:56.914 --> 00:38:58.494]  It was me, Tom Foti, and Cosmos.
[00:38:58.794 --> 00:39:01.635]  And we basically asked him a question, and I made a statement to him.
[00:39:01.895 --> 00:39:02.895]  And I basically told him... Let me stop you.
[00:39:02.915 --> 00:39:03.475]  Describe this.
[00:39:03.515 --> 00:39:06.976]  Describe what time it was, what his house looks like, where it's located.
[00:39:06.996 --> 00:39:07.476]  Go through it all.
[00:39:07.876 --> 00:39:13.537]  Oh, his house is on 146 65th Street and Lexington on the Upper West Side here in New York City.
[00:39:14.298 --> 00:39:15.458]  Upper East Side, excuse me.
[00:39:15.538 --> 00:39:16.398]  And it's a big house.
[00:39:16.438 --> 00:39:17.618]  He has a lot of cameras out there.
[00:39:17.638 --> 00:39:20.219]  He had three black SUVs out in front of his house.
[00:39:20.615 --> 00:39:22.236]  And again, many camcorders all over the place.
[00:39:22.516 --> 00:39:26.039]  We were staking out the place for a while, and luckily we got lucky that Tuesday.
[00:39:26.439 --> 00:39:34.766]  And as we saw him coming out, we basically just ran up to him, I had my camera, Tom Potey had his camera, Chicago had his camera, and we just told him, we basically just gave him a statement.
[00:39:35.086 --> 00:39:47.075]  We told him that, you know, his new world order was going down, national sovereignty is going to prevail, Tom Potey told him, I'm going to put Tom Potey on the line, and he said something to him too, and he just panicked and just ran in his car with all his thugs all over the place.
[00:39:47.655 --> 00:39:51.357]  Did he have Mr. Ford with him, the bodyguard that's always by his side when we've seen him?
[00:39:52.257 --> 00:39:53.597]  I'm not familiar with Mr. Ford.
[00:39:53.697 --> 00:39:56.318]  I'll be able to identify as soon as I... Look, I gotta see this video.
[00:39:56.338 --> 00:39:57.679]  This is gonna be the creme de la creme.
[00:39:58.079 --> 00:39:59.660]  Also, you've got Julianic in front of him.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:00.580]  We'll get into that in a moment.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.121]  Let's go to Tom Affoti.
[00:40:02.681 --> 00:40:05.222]  Tom, tell us exactly what happened.
[00:40:05.642 --> 00:40:05.982]  Hey, man.
[00:40:06.002 --> 00:40:06.762]  Good to talk to you again.
[00:40:06.783 --> 00:40:07.503]  Good to talk to you.
[00:40:07.523 --> 00:40:07.863]  How've you been?
[00:40:08.644 --> 00:40:22.516]  Good, for those who don't know who Tom is, if you watch our CFR protest of last September 12th, out front exposing them for being involved in 9-11, you see Tom there, screaming and yelling at the New World Order, wearing a suit.
[00:40:22.556 --> 00:40:23.117]  Go ahead, Tom.
[00:40:23.877 --> 00:40:27.000]  Well, let's see, where do you want me to start with?
[00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:27.861]  Is it Rockefeller?
[00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:29.742]  Yeah, just blow by blow, my friend.
[00:40:30.583 --> 00:40:34.426]  Okay, well we heard about where he lived, and we said, let's take a chance.
[00:40:34.466 --> 00:40:36.008]  We went up there, Cosmos,
[00:40:36.661 --> 00:40:38.703]  I think he's trying to attack us right now.
[00:40:39.323 --> 00:40:42.546]  And Cosmos happened to be staying here for that week.
[00:40:43.207 --> 00:40:46.029]  And we just took a chance and we went up there and we waited.
[00:40:46.049 --> 00:40:48.351]  It was about 6 o'clock to 7 o'clock.
[00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:49.512]  And God was with him.
[00:40:49.972 --> 00:40:50.833]  And God was with us.
[00:40:51.113 --> 00:40:57.238]  And I saw... I had been up there once before in that area and I saw his car.
[00:40:57.258 --> 00:41:00.081]  And it was the car that he uses and it was a black Caddy.
[00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:01.342]  And we saw the black Caddy pull up.
[00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:06.551]  He was going to come up and out, or he was going to come out of the house, one or the other.
[00:41:06.971 --> 00:41:14.113]  We just waited there, and luckily, his bodyguard came out, and he was with a woman.
[00:41:14.133 --> 00:41:16.654]  I don't know if Peggy is still alive, actually.
[00:41:16.694 --> 00:41:18.134]  I don't know if it was her.
[00:41:18.595 --> 00:41:21.395]  But he was in a tuxedo, and maybe he was going to an event at some time.
[00:41:21.955 --> 00:41:23.976]  And Luke just converged on him.
[00:41:23.996 --> 00:41:25.697]  I had a great shot with him facing Luke off.
[00:41:26.357 --> 00:41:29.137]  And Luke was telling him about the New World Order and how he's not going to succeed.
[00:41:29.157 --> 00:41:29.758]  He's going down.
[00:41:31.469 --> 00:41:36.192]  There was actually a plan for Luke to autograph the, uh, you know, we had Dave Ruckels book.
[00:41:36.912 --> 00:41:39.974]  We had a loose plan, which was for Luke to stop him and ask him for an autograph.
[00:41:39.994 --> 00:41:42.176]  And of course his book calls for the end of America.
[00:41:42.736 --> 00:41:46.018]  Yeah, his book explicitly states, Alex, that he was working against the United States.
[00:41:46.338 --> 00:41:46.618]  Yes.
[00:41:46.698 --> 00:41:47.159]  He says it.
[00:41:47.419 --> 00:41:49.700]  He is a treasonous larsenist piece of filth.
[00:41:49.980 --> 00:41:50.781]  Right, yeah, page 405.
[00:41:51.862 --> 00:41:54.803]  So, um, the plan was for Luke to stop him and then ask him to converge with the cameras.
[00:41:55.224 --> 00:41:59.706]  But there was a whole bunch of bodyguards who didn't, uh, who kind of were obstacles to that, but we did our best.
[00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:00.667]  So, um,
[00:42:01.537 --> 00:42:06.920]  Then he was going toward the car as Luke was shouting at him, and I had the camera, and I was talking to him.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:16.686]  I had read something on Blogger about a citizen's grand jury that would reach the probable cause for further investigation into David Rockefeller for conspiracy to commit mass murder.
[00:42:17.306 --> 00:42:21.749]  So I basically slimmed that down to a question, and just said, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Rockefeller,
[00:42:22.136 --> 00:42:25.199]  The citizen's grand jury is indicting you for the crimes of 9-11.
[00:42:25.299 --> 00:42:26.360]  How do you respond, sir?
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:28.381]  So, he was saying that.
[00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:30.903]  I was right on the other side of his car when he was saying that.
[00:42:31.264 --> 00:42:32.264]  When I was saying that, I'm sorry.
[00:42:32.685 --> 00:42:36.027]  And he couldn't get into his car fast enough.
[00:42:36.047 --> 00:42:41.512]  I can't say how he was... I can't describe how he was affected.
[00:42:41.572 --> 00:42:43.313]  It looked to us like he was flustered.
[00:42:43.333 --> 00:42:45.695]  He turned around for a moment, not knowing who was going to get in the car first.
[00:42:46.256 --> 00:42:46.916]  And then he got in.
[00:42:47.497 --> 00:42:51.220]  This is all happening while the security guards were shoving us out of the way.
[00:42:51.789 --> 00:42:53.350]  You know, so it was a bit of a test.
[00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.591]  Now, were you on his property when they were shoving you?
[00:42:56.431 --> 00:42:58.552]  Well, we were in front of the house.
[00:42:58.572 --> 00:42:59.393]  We were on the sidewalk.
[00:42:59.473 --> 00:43:00.373]  Luke was on the sidewalk.
[00:43:00.393 --> 00:43:01.694]  Well, then they shouldn't have done that.
[00:43:01.734 --> 00:43:02.414]  That's assault.
[00:43:03.234 --> 00:43:05.035]  Yeah, you know, you're probably right, Alex.
[00:43:05.055 --> 00:43:06.176]  We probably couldn't have him for assault.
[00:43:06.196 --> 00:43:09.417]  You need to go ahead and file assault charges on David Rockefeller's bodyguards.
[00:43:09.938 --> 00:43:11.718]  Okay, and we have it on film.
[00:43:11.738 --> 00:43:14.640]  Well, I mean, I hope you guys know what you did is extremely dangerous.
[00:43:15.835 --> 00:43:17.576]  I mean, let's just be honest about it.
[00:43:17.596 --> 00:43:22.198]  You just went up against the head of the North American arm, the Superstate.
[00:43:22.218 --> 00:43:25.780]  I mean, we're talking about THE Emperor, and good job.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.640]  I mean, I'm telling you, this is hardcore.
[00:43:28.081 --> 00:43:29.121]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:43:29.141 --> 00:43:31.042]  We really didn't think about the danger when we were doing it.
[00:43:31.082 --> 00:43:32.562]  We thought about the people that we lost.
[00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:36.684]  You know, we thought about Danny Wallace and his dad, and we thought about some friends of mine.
[00:43:37.004 --> 00:43:37.765]  No, I understand.
[00:43:37.785 --> 00:43:39.145]  I know why you do what you do.
[00:43:39.185 --> 00:43:39.866]  God bless you.
[00:43:40.306 --> 00:43:42.627]  What else did Luke say, or I mean, what else was said?
[00:43:43.467 --> 00:43:46.668]  Well, it wasn't a very long confrontation.
[00:43:46.688 --> 00:43:50.130]  I mean, the whole thing probably lasted about 50 seconds, less than a minute, you know.
[00:43:50.590 --> 00:44:00.253]  Luke stated to him clearly that the New World Order was going to go down, that he was here to deliver the message himself personally, that he's not going to be able to run our lives.
[00:44:01.414 --> 00:44:04.055]  And I just screamed my question about twice to him.
[00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:07.797]  But, you know, and Luke got pretty much face-to-face with one of the security guys.
[00:44:07.837 --> 00:44:10.003]  Now, did Luke have a camera in his hand, too, and you had one?
[00:44:10.023 --> 00:44:10.624]  He had a camera.
[00:44:10.644 --> 00:44:11.426]  He had a hidden camera.
[00:44:11.446 --> 00:44:12.289]  He had a camera in his hand.
[00:44:12.309 --> 00:44:13.351]  I did have a camera in my hand, Luke.
[00:44:14.125 --> 00:44:14.885]  Absolutely.
[00:44:14.945 --> 00:44:15.546]  Pure gold.
[00:44:15.846 --> 00:44:16.606]  Absolute gold.
[00:44:17.427 --> 00:44:18.447]  Let me talk to Luke real fast.
[00:44:18.467 --> 00:44:19.127]  We've got plenty of time.
[00:44:19.187 --> 00:44:23.729]  I want to hold you guys over and talk about Giuliani coming up, how Al Gore got confronted, you went into the CFR.
[00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:24.790]  I mean, I love it.
[00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:30.252]  Just daring raids into the heart of the New World Order, hitting multiple big targets here in the Info War.
[00:44:30.773 --> 00:44:38.116]  Absolute, and this is deep, deep bombing behind enemy lines of, I mean, major, and I mean that in the Info War sense, folks.
[00:44:38.496 --> 00:44:45.581]  I mean a major enemy installations here because again by putting this on the web will show everybody who the true controllers are, who the masters are.
[00:44:45.982 --> 00:44:52.546]  We're going behind the veil here and we're illustrating it with just incredible theater, theater of reality.
[00:44:53.207 --> 00:44:56.009]  This is just absolutely avant-garde what's happening.
[00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.191]  Let's throw Luke on real fast.
[00:44:58.211 --> 00:44:59.071]  Luke, what was it like?
[00:44:59.412 --> 00:45:00.472]  I'm gonna hold you over.
[00:45:00.572 --> 00:45:01.313]  I'm gonna hold you over.
[00:45:01.333 --> 00:45:01.653]  Go ahead.
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:04.881]  What was he?
[00:45:05.642 --> 00:45:07.885]  Luke, how close were you to Rockefeller?
[00:45:08.185 --> 00:45:09.327]  I was face to face with him.
[00:45:09.367 --> 00:45:10.549]  I saw him straight face.
[00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:11.570]  I saw evil, man.
[00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:12.512]  I saw darkness.
[00:45:12.592 --> 00:45:14.835]  I saw scum, trash, basically.
[00:45:14.895 --> 00:45:16.217]  And it was kind of scary.
[00:45:16.237 --> 00:45:18.941]  Did he try to tear you down with the cold depths of hell?
[00:45:19.747 --> 00:45:24.769]  It was pretty scary, but then his security guard just shoved me away and kind of put me away from him.
[00:45:24.789 --> 00:45:26.110]  He was kind of running away in his car.
[00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:27.851]  Did he set his teeth?
[00:45:27.911 --> 00:45:28.911]  Like, did he show his teeth?
[00:45:28.931 --> 00:45:30.192]  Because he likes to do that.
[00:45:30.872 --> 00:45:32.713]  I think he actually did show his teeth.
[00:45:32.973 --> 00:45:33.813]  No, of course he did.
[00:45:34.033 --> 00:45:39.156]  He glanced at me, looked at his teeth, looked at his eyes, and it was kind of glaring, kind of looming.
[00:45:39.176 --> 00:45:41.977]  That guy has got tens of millions.
[00:45:42.857 --> 00:45:46.199]  Literally, folks, that guy is just evil.
[00:45:46.539 --> 00:45:48.440]  That guy is as evil as Hitler.
[00:45:49.013 --> 00:45:51.433]  Yeah, I mean, look at his eugenics and population control work.
[00:45:51.474 --> 00:45:54.494]  Look at him financing all these, you know, cancer and the vaccines.
[00:45:54.554 --> 00:45:56.234]  That guy is the ultimate.
[00:45:56.655 --> 00:45:58.075]  Yeah, that guy's the ultimate scum.
[00:45:58.115 --> 00:46:03.236]  He's one of the top new world order elite trash that I think we have to concentrate as a movement on.
[00:46:03.436 --> 00:46:05.716]  And I think if we're not doing that, we're wasting our time.
[00:46:05.776 --> 00:46:07.217]  We can't start going after puppets.
[00:46:07.237 --> 00:46:11.658]  We have to go after the true state of power, the people who own the Federal Reserve, the people at the Bilderberg meetings.
[00:46:11.958 --> 00:46:14.018]  And I'm telling you right now, we hit about
[00:46:14.468 --> 00:46:16.214]  Three members of the Bilderberg last week.
[00:46:16.354 --> 00:46:20.508]  Dave Rockefeller, John Edwards, and Richard Hodges, I believe.
[00:46:20.548 --> 00:46:21.592]  I think he's also Bilderberg.
[00:46:23.291 --> 00:46:27.072]  Okay, now what happened is you finally called my cell phone, which is the number for you to call.
[00:46:27.273 --> 00:46:30.034]  I at least check that three or four times a day, Luke.
[00:46:30.414 --> 00:46:34.895]  And I got your messages from 815 this morning when I guess you guys decided to let everybody know about this.
[00:46:35.596 --> 00:46:38.357]  But I'm going to give you some other hotline numbers to make sure this doesn't happen.
[00:46:38.377 --> 00:46:40.537]  You're probably just calling the main media line.
[00:46:40.778 --> 00:46:41.638]  Yeah, not a problem.
[00:46:41.978 --> 00:46:43.759]  And yeah, today we were out here seeing Giuliani.
[00:46:43.799 --> 00:46:47.600]  It's important to note, Giuliani is also going to continue his speaking tour today in the city.
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:52.582]  And I want to tell everybody, anybody in the tri-state area, if you're in Brooklyn or anywhere in New York City,
[00:46:53.287 --> 00:47:02.177]  Giuliani speaking today from 5 o'clock to 7 o'clock in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn on 47... on 476th and 76th Street.
[00:47:02.517 --> 00:47:03.178]  This is today.
[00:47:03.238 --> 00:47:04.539]  This is still going on today.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.205]  And also, later on tonight, he's speaking in Staten Island from 7 through 9 p.m.
[00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:12.588]  at Vanderbilt South Beach, Staten Island.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:13.460]  That's
[00:47:31.457 --> 00:47:34.259]  And all the media was there and he didn't know nothing, and he lied.
[00:47:34.679 --> 00:47:37.141]  I could have Sabrina on and she could tell you what kind of message he had.
[00:47:37.161 --> 00:47:40.764]  Yes, yes, and then I want to go back to Tom, I want to go back to you, I want to hold you guys over.
[00:47:41.384 --> 00:47:43.026]  Let me go to Sabrina Rivera.
[00:47:43.086 --> 00:47:44.187]  I'm giving you Sabrina right now.
[00:47:45.788 --> 00:47:47.009]  Hi Alex, Sabrina, how are you?
[00:47:47.289 --> 00:47:51.192]  Hi Sabrina, I want to commend you for having the courage to confront Giuliani.
[00:47:51.232 --> 00:47:51.992]  Tell us what happened.
[00:47:52.933 --> 00:47:54.874]  Basically, we got up this morning about 5am.
[00:47:56.224 --> 00:47:59.766]  About maybe a half hour sleep and we just drove out to the Bronx.
[00:47:59.806 --> 00:48:02.508]  We got there about 7 o'clock and we were just waiting out there.
[00:48:03.008 --> 00:48:03.968]  Where was he speaking?
[00:48:04.489 --> 00:48:08.791]  He was speaking in the Bronx.
[00:48:08.871 --> 00:48:11.532]  It was called Seashore Restaurant.
[00:48:12.293 --> 00:48:14.694]  It was a fundraiser for the Boy Scouts of America.
[00:48:15.855 --> 00:48:23.119]  And we basically waited out there until he came and I had the hidden camera on me and I basically just shook his hand and I told him
[00:48:23.883 --> 00:48:31.970]  I'm a 9-11 victim family member, and I told him that because he came to the memorial service for Lieutenant Robert F. Wallace in October 2001.
[00:48:32.490 --> 00:48:40.397]  And then I nonchalantly just asked him, I said, you reported to Peter Jennings specifically that the towers 1 and 2 were going to collapse.
[00:48:40.937 --> 00:48:47.943]  And I told him that no steel structure in history has ever come down due to fire, and how come the people in the buildings weren't notified, and who the hell else knew about this?
[00:48:48.003 --> 00:48:50.625]  And I also asked him nonchalantly, how can you sleep at night?
[00:48:51.331 --> 00:48:58.397]  And what did the, uh, Craitor's... During this whole time, he's shaking my hand during this whole time, and he basically said, he basically said I had no prior knowledge.
[00:48:58.558 --> 00:49:07.866]  Did he wipe that penguin smile off his face, or did he... No, he had that, yeah, he had that, just that stupid smile on his face, that smirk, and I bet he didn't even remember going to the, to the memorial service.
[00:49:07.926 --> 00:49:13.211]  I mean, that guy literally looks like a barracuda, and I don't normally go off looks, but I mean, he radiates evil.
[00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:14.192]  Yeah, he does.
[00:49:14.952 --> 00:49:17.735]  Nothing compared to Rockefeller, he's more like a lower demon, but...
[00:49:18.453 --> 00:49:23.254]  More like a, you know, Loki or something, but I mean, I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:49:23.274 --> 00:49:24.355]  I'm so sick of looking at him.
[00:49:24.695 --> 00:49:34.918]  Yeah, and it made it, you know, even during the whole time I was shaking because, you know, I'm, this, you know, since I'm a family member, just me asking him this question, just, you know... Well, he's a hardcore killer.
[00:49:34.938 --> 00:49:37.319]  You're looking at somebody that killed members, a member of your family.
[00:49:37.579 --> 00:49:38.319]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:38.599 --> 00:49:40.300]  Like, I was surprised I didn't break down.
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:43.220]  I was shaking the whole time, but, you know, I got whatever I had.
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.142]  Well, that shaking was power rising up in you against your enemy.
[00:49:47.542 --> 00:49:48.022]  Exactly.
[00:49:48.462 --> 00:50:05.151]  And we're going to see him again today in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, and I have another question to ask him, because his Secret Service, of course, you know, they pushed him away and they told us to leave, and actually, the owner of the restaurant came out and was like, oh, this is private property, you can't be in.
[00:50:05.171 --> 00:50:06.792]  I was like, well, you know what, we're waiting for him.
[00:50:07.172 --> 00:50:09.814]  I'm a victim's family member, and he's like, I don't care who you are.
[00:50:11.619 --> 00:50:18.789]  Yeah, we want the son of a known mob boss here to... I mean now the mob doesn't just have their, you know, their thugs out on the street.
[00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:19.730]  They're Secret Service.
[00:50:20.572 --> 00:50:22.635]  That's how America works here.
[00:50:23.562 --> 00:50:28.225]  While Bush is busy ending the country right now, this is unbelievable.
[00:50:53.762 --> 00:50:59.603]  They're at Mach 10 with their hair on fire, engaging the New World Order capital ships at point-blank range.
[00:51:01.384 --> 00:51:09.945]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.305 --> 00:51:17.927]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.641 --> 00:51:25.684]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.104 --> 00:51:37.569]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:41.391]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.771 --> 00:51:43.732]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.052 --> 00:51:47.914]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:07.206 --> 00:52:11.349]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:11.789 --> 00:52:12.630]  So what do you do?

[00:52:17.973 --> 00:52:20.094]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:20.594 --> 00:52:21.494]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:52:21.894 --> 00:52:25.616]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.

[00:53:01.198 --> 00:53:02.899]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.139 --> 00:53:06.820]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:16.082]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.243 --> 00:53:21.084]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.344 --> 00:53:30.367]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:53:30.687 --> 00:53:36.669]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[00:53:36.949 --> 00:53:38.169]  Come, you masters of war!
[00:54:08.653 --> 00:54:10.575]  It'll build the big guns.
[00:54:12.998 --> 00:54:15.341]  It'll build the death planes.
[00:54:17.323 --> 00:54:19.165]  It'll build all the bombs.
[00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:33.435]  I'm literally hyperventilating over this David Rockefeller footage.
[00:54:33.555 --> 00:54:35.917]  Luke and the crew have got to dub copies, mail them to me today.
[00:54:35.937 --> 00:54:38.559]  They've got to go confront Giuliani.
[00:54:39.319 --> 00:54:43.182]  And then somehow he's going to try to come back and upload it to YouTube.
[00:54:43.222 --> 00:54:47.545]  But the key is getting multiple copies of that out to other sources immediately.
[00:54:48.268 --> 00:54:49.808]  That is absolute gold.
[00:54:49.828 --> 00:54:52.089]  I have three different camera angles of David Rockefeller.
[00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.949]  Oh, he's so evil.
[00:54:54.329 --> 00:54:56.210]  Let's go back to Sabrina Rivera.
[00:54:56.230 --> 00:54:56.710]  Sabrina?
[00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:59.270]  Hi.
[00:54:59.491 --> 00:55:00.451]  God bless you.
[00:55:00.491 --> 00:55:01.951]  Tell us who you lost on 9-11.
[00:55:02.631 --> 00:55:05.992]  I actually lost Lieutenant Robert F. Wallace.
[00:55:06.032 --> 00:55:08.313]  He's actually Dan Wallace's father.
[00:55:10.193 --> 00:55:14.074]  It was weird, you know, that day, it was his first day back to work.
[00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:22.532]  He was on medical leave for the whole summer and it was just ironic that was his first day back to work and that first day and that was it.
[00:55:22.772 --> 00:55:24.673]  That was his first and last day.
[00:55:24.693 --> 00:55:27.774]  And for folks who don't know, tell them who Dan Wallace is.
[00:55:27.994 --> 00:55:36.637]  Dan Wallace, he was also part of WeAreChanged.org and he recently just passed away, a lot of people know, on January 29, 2007.
[00:55:37.437 --> 00:55:43.179]  And he was just a courageous young man that just fought for truth and was just trying to find answers.
[00:55:43.735 --> 00:55:46.677]  Just to, you know, something to justify his father's death.
[00:55:46.737 --> 00:55:49.158]  But, you know, we're still fighting now.
[00:55:49.178 --> 00:55:51.959]  We'll keep fighting until we get justice.
[00:55:52.419 --> 00:55:56.502]  For not only Robert F. Wallace, but for the rest of the victims and the first responders.
[00:55:56.522 --> 00:55:58.883]  And Sabrina, you were real close friends with him, weren't you?
[00:55:59.823 --> 00:56:01.724]  Yes, I was Dan Wallace's girlfriend.
[00:56:01.904 --> 00:56:03.625]  Yeah, that's what I had remembered reading.
[00:56:04.045 --> 00:56:05.106]  Right.
[00:56:05.126 --> 00:56:06.027]  So that is family.
[00:56:06.047 --> 00:56:10.789]  Well, that's just terrible what happened to Dan, of course, and his father.
[00:56:10.829 --> 00:56:12.630]  But what you're doing keeps the memory alive.
[00:56:13.608 --> 00:56:15.709]  Anything else you want to add concerning Giuliani?
[00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:23.153]  Well, what I've seen today, I have another question for him and I hope, you know what, I hope he tries to answer me.
[00:56:23.755 --> 00:56:25.337]  Um, would you like to know the question?
[00:56:25.877 --> 00:56:26.538]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:56:26.958 --> 00:56:31.763]  Um, basically, uh, why in your attempt to destroy evidence did you throw 45% of victims in a dump?
[00:56:32.164 --> 00:56:33.245]  What were you trying to cover up?
[00:56:33.485 --> 00:56:36.968]  How could you disrespect the family members by not having a thorough investigation?
[00:56:37.469 --> 00:56:41.233]  You're a real investigator, so you know damn well not to throw away evidence.
[00:56:41.493 --> 00:56:45.497]  And that's basically, and I want to see the expression on his face when I ask him that.
[00:56:46.818 --> 00:57:05.404]  Well, you know, they talk about us saying we shouldn't bring up 9-11 and it hurts the victims' families, but the families, the majority of them, on record, believe it's an inside job now, or question the official story, bare minimum, the vast majority question it, and we're not the ones using it for, to be mixed in with concrete for the potholes.
[00:57:05.944 --> 00:57:06.144]  Right.
[00:57:06.644 --> 00:57:11.966]  And that's Associated Press, by the way, that's not, I mean, they're the ones that could care less and covered everything up.
[00:57:12.346 --> 00:57:15.167]  Sabrina, I want to get you back on to Mara after your latest
[00:57:16.235 --> 00:57:26.659]  I just wanted to say that you've been a great inspiration to us as well, and it's funny, you had sent, I think it was after the Silverstein video, when Luke and I were holding the banner outside of Silverstein's Building 7, you sent us two cameras.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.981]  And one of the cameras is what I used to photograph the Rockefeller.
[00:57:49.441 --> 00:57:51.021]  So it really came into play there.
[00:57:51.041 --> 00:57:51.521]  Thanks so much.
[00:57:52.261 --> 00:58:04.544]  The other thing I want to add is that just my belief, my deep-seated belief, that we're going to win this and that the guys in power, they don't have as much power over us as they think they have.
[00:58:04.984 --> 00:58:06.464]  They don't have an army of their own.
[00:58:06.544 --> 00:58:08.525]  They don't have a police force of their own.
[00:58:08.545 --> 00:58:09.265]  They have to use ours.
[00:58:09.685 --> 00:58:14.106]  And as long as our movement keeps growing and the awareness keeps growing, 9-1-1 is an inside job,
[00:58:14.525 --> 00:58:15.646]  We'll get more of those policemen.
[00:58:15.686 --> 00:58:17.647]  We'll get more of the military on our side.
[00:58:18.087 --> 00:58:21.448]  And the big guys won't have anybody to enforce a police state.
[00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:22.829]  Tom, stay there.
[00:58:23.369 --> 00:58:24.110]  Luke, stay there.
[00:58:24.510 --> 00:58:25.470]  Sabrina, stay there.
[00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:27.091]  70-second break.
[00:58:27.271 --> 00:58:28.572]  Second hour will start.
[00:58:29.212 --> 00:58:39.377]  And I'm going to spend two more segments with our daring crew to talk about other globalists they confronted in the last week and the infiltration of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:58:41.169 --> 00:58:44.232]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:44.252 --> 00:58:44.533]  Big Brother.
[00:58:44.553 --> 00:58:45.053]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:45.073 --> 00:58:45.734]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:45.754 --> 00:58:46.175]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.855 --> 00:59:04.736]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.397 --> 00:59:09.381]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.601 --> 00:59:13.705]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:30.714]  Now into our number two.
[00:59:30.794 --> 00:59:34.036]  There is so much world news happening, so many important things.
[00:59:34.476 --> 00:59:35.717]  Everything is accelerating.
[00:59:36.258 --> 00:59:40.140]  If you just joined us, Luke Radowski is an InfoWars.com field reporter.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:47.145]  He's also working with Sabrina Rivera, whose boyfriend's father died on 9-11.
[00:59:47.205 --> 00:59:48.826]  He has since died mysteriously.
[00:59:49.887 --> 00:59:56.031]  And we've got Tom Cote, who I've known for a few years now, since I was there in 2004, covering things at Ground Zero.
[00:59:57.066 --> 01:00:04.812]  And Tom with Luke and I went out and confronted the Globalist at the Council on Foreign Relations at a protest on September 12th of last year.
[01:00:05.372 --> 01:00:10.296]  They're in New York City, but they're in uptown Manhattan.
[01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:13.778]  Now they have confronted David Rockefeller at his home.
[01:00:14.399 --> 01:00:18.922]  They've confronted a bunch of other Globalists, Giuliani, other CFR members in the last few days.
[01:00:19.222 --> 01:00:24.046]  Going back to Tom Fote and then to Luke and Sabrina, we'll be with us for two more segments, then we'll get into all the other news.
[01:00:24.813 --> 01:00:26.194]  The video will be going up on YouTube.
[01:00:26.394 --> 01:00:27.575]  I pray God tonight.
[01:00:28.216 --> 01:00:32.440]  Frankly, I think with the video you've got, guys, it's more important to get that up now than confront Giuliani again.
[01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:37.063]  But I think you've got time to get it uploaded and make dubs and still get to at least one of his events.
[01:00:37.083 --> 01:00:41.387]  I don't know if you should try to hit both of his events, but listenership will tell folks how they can do that.
[01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:43.309]  Hit them in the info war.
[01:00:43.969 --> 01:00:44.970]  Confront them with the truth.
[01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:45.991]  Slap them with the truth.
[01:00:46.031 --> 01:00:47.072]  Confront these murderers.
[01:00:48.051 --> 01:00:57.476]  But going back to Tom Fote, you were making points about how important it was to let them know that they're not invincible and that we are aware of what they're doing.
[01:00:58.356 --> 01:01:01.938]  Yeah, I believe that very deeply, Alex.
[01:01:02.438 --> 01:01:12.223]  Because, you know, part of the discussion about 9-11 is that a lot of people are still light hop or they still think that it's Bush and Cheney.
[01:01:12.859 --> 01:01:20.124]  And you, Luke, and I have known for a long time now that it goes way beyond that, you know, within a two-year show and so on, you know, that we've got to go after the New World Order, you know.
[01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:29.189]  But when you get to the big guys in the New World Order, when you get to the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, and the royal families, you know, what it is, it's an international cabal.
[01:01:29.370 --> 01:01:31.891]  That's what David Rockefeller admitted to, actually, in his book on page 405.
[01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:33.952]  It's an international cabal.
[01:01:34.173 --> 01:01:37.054]  And they control us by manipulation, more than anything else.
[01:01:38.662 --> 01:01:40.423]  I call it power by hypnosis.
[01:01:41.984 --> 01:01:49.908]  Using organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission, they basically try to control our media and our politicians.
[01:01:51.385 --> 01:01:53.307]  But they don't have any real power.
[01:01:53.327 --> 01:01:55.248]  They don't have armies like Julius Caesar had armies.
[01:01:55.368 --> 01:01:55.969]  You know what I mean?
[01:01:55.989 --> 01:01:57.129]  They're not going to invade us, you know?
[01:01:57.450 --> 01:01:58.731]  They use our power against us.
[01:01:58.871 --> 01:02:01.393]  That's why they're trying to set up martial law so they can.
[01:02:01.473 --> 01:02:03.594]  That's why they're trying to restrict free speech so they can.
[01:02:04.295 --> 01:02:10.380]  Well, you know, I mean, if you go super optimistic, Alex, I don't think that our police officers are going to turn against us.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:13.702]  I think that the word is getting out far and wide about 9-11.
[01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:17.625]  Not only that, the administration is very unpopular because of the Iraq War.
[01:02:18.206 --> 01:02:19.206]  And I think they know it.
[01:02:19.427 --> 01:02:19.827]  Think about it.
[01:02:19.847 --> 01:02:21.128]  It's been almost six years.
[01:02:21.721 --> 01:02:24.683]  Since 9-11, and they wanted to take over the world since then.
[01:02:24.724 --> 01:02:25.324]  They haven't yet.
[01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:26.845]  My belief is because they can't.
[01:02:27.306 --> 01:02:32.470]  You know, my biggest worry is about the RFID chips and about the technology.
[01:02:32.490 --> 01:02:34.672]  Well, that's why they want them, so they can track everybody.
[01:02:35.272 --> 01:02:35.893]  Right.
[01:02:35.913 --> 01:02:41.678]  Once they get that in with the National ID Card and Cashless Society, then they have a much better chance.
[01:02:42.178 --> 01:02:48.063]  But I think we have to work really hard to make sure that doesn't happen, and I think we have to work really hard to focus on the New World Order.
[01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:54.513]  You know, because there's always a slight chance that they can pin this thing on Bush and Cheney.
[01:02:54.793 --> 01:02:55.413]  Absolutely!
[01:02:55.433 --> 01:02:57.414]  In fact, I've been saying that since the day of 9-11.
[01:02:57.794 --> 01:02:59.895]  Right, you know, and then get themselves off the hook, you know?
[01:03:00.376 --> 01:03:15.122]  So, I would like to personally encourage anybody listening out there to focus on the New World Order, focus on the Rothschilds, Rockefellers, and the elite, and how they have power over the Bushes and over all the other politicians, you know?
[01:03:15.323 --> 01:03:16.783]  Because I kind of equate it to the
[01:03:18.832 --> 01:03:28.460]  You know, everybody thinks that the New World Order is this great, big, powerful guy with fire breathing out of his ears and so on, but what you really do is pull back the curtain and it's a bunch of old guys.
[01:03:29.082 --> 01:03:30.603]  You know, as we have proved, we live in houses.
[01:03:30.623 --> 01:03:32.704]  You know what I mean?
[01:03:32.744 --> 01:03:33.684]  They don't live in castles.
[01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:38.366]  Not that I... Listen, I'm all about peace and all about... I hate to be corny.
[01:03:38.646 --> 01:03:40.967]  Love and Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
[01:03:41.287 --> 01:03:48.490]  I really don't want to hurt anybody, but I do think the truth will reveal to people... Now, it hurts them to confront them and let them know that you know they're killers.
[01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:49.411]  Stay there!
[01:03:49.771 --> 01:03:52.232]  We'll be right back with the CFR infiltration.
[01:03:56.326 --> 01:04:01.796]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.157 --> 01:04:09.770]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.481 --> 01:04:17.543]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.944 --> 01:04:29.387]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.668 --> 01:04:33.249]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.629 --> 01:04:35.570]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:39.731]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:56.629 --> 01:04:59.510]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:05.932]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:05:47.253 --> 01:05:56.997]  803-4438 or order on the web at Berkeywater.com I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[01:05:57.458 --> 01:06:00.159]  But every time I get a pedicure my feet look great.
[01:06:00.899 --> 01:06:02.040]  For a while anyway.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.721]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[01:06:06.321 --> 01:06:08.642]  Listen, haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[01:06:08.962 --> 01:06:12.464]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:06:12.824 --> 01:06:14.965]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:06:15.632 --> 01:06:16.333]  What's the name again?
[01:06:16.353 --> 01:06:17.694]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:06:18.095 --> 01:06:18.936]  It's Calex.
[01:06:19.256 --> 01:06:20.998]  C-A-L-E-X.
[01:06:21.799 --> 01:06:23.481]  What makes Calex ointment so different?
[01:06:23.681 --> 01:06:31.970]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:37.575]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use Enzyme-Rich Moisturizing Cal-X Ointment.
[01:06:37.795 --> 01:06:46.924]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, HEB Grocery Stores, Medicine Shop Pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:06:47.625 --> 01:06:48.726]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[01:06:48.786 --> 01:06:49.427]  I'll be right back.
[01:06:49.707 --> 01:06:50.628]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[01:06:57.655 --> 01:06:58.296]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.956 --> 01:07:00.017]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:01.858]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.479 --> 01:07:03.319]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:04.920]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.601 --> 01:07:09.564]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.804 --> 01:07:13.947]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:24.054]  Info warriors across the United States are confronting globalists everywhere they go.
[01:07:26.008 --> 01:07:39.351]  Every day, new videos get uploaded as presidential candidates and politicians, governors, CFR members, corporate chieftains are confronted about a host of issues, including 9-11, the war, you name it.
[01:07:39.992 --> 01:07:49.914]  And Americans are learning how to be activists, how to be revolutionaries, how to be involved again, how to restore the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and true info warriors, literally,
[01:07:50.703 --> 01:07:56.347]  Under the Infowars.com banner aren't Luke Hradowski, Sabrina Rivero, Tom Fote.
[01:07:57.468 --> 01:08:04.813]  Luke, I'm going to let you guys go here in just a few minutes because I want you to be able to do all the work you've got and hopefully get that up on Google.
[01:08:05.134 --> 01:08:07.355]  I would just pick one of those Giulianis to go up in front of you.
[01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:07.836]  Try both.
[01:08:07.856 --> 01:08:09.056]  I'd go the later one.
[01:08:09.076 --> 01:08:12.079]  That way you'll have time to get over there and still get the other stuff done.
[01:08:12.459 --> 01:08:13.219]  But do what you want.
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.603]  You see the terrain of the land better than I do the lay of the land.
[01:08:18.579 --> 01:08:20.561]  You know, like special forces in the Info War.
[01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:21.402]  You just go at them.
[01:08:22.202 --> 01:08:23.844]  Seek and destroy in the Info War.
[01:08:23.904 --> 01:08:26.706]  Destroy their lies with our weapon, the truth.
[01:08:27.107 --> 01:08:30.850]  But Luke, get into the CFR.
[01:08:30.890 --> 01:08:31.911]  Tell us about that.
[01:08:32.292 --> 01:08:33.493]  Sneaking into the CFR.
[01:08:33.933 --> 01:08:34.373]  Yeah, man.
[01:08:34.393 --> 01:08:35.254]  That was really interesting.
[01:08:35.294 --> 01:08:42.541]  I mean, last Wednesday, the CFR was holding a lecture by presidential candidate John Edwards.
[01:08:42.561 --> 01:08:43.442]  And I came in there.
[01:08:43.502 --> 01:08:44.603]  I dressed up in a nice suit.
[01:08:45.524 --> 01:08:49.105]  A real spiffy, like, nice, elite, corporate, trash suit.
[01:08:49.825 --> 01:08:57.267]  And I just came in there, and I showed them my press passes, showed them my, uh, Infowars press passes, and, uh, the lady at the desk just said, okay, just walk in.
[01:08:57.427 --> 01:08:58.368]  And I started walking in.
[01:08:59.088 --> 01:09:04.910]  They actually put me in the overflow room, which I couldn't really, uh, I couldn't see, no, they just put me in next to a television and him talking.
[01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:12.852]  So what I did, after everything, I snuck into the main room, and I walked into the, I walked into the main hall where all the CFR officials were.
[01:09:13.556 --> 01:09:14.497]  And I saw John Edwards.
[01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:17.240]  And I had my hidden camera on me, and I had my regular camera on me.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.302]  I looked at John Edwards running, and I shook his hand.
[01:09:19.803 --> 01:09:28.712]  And I was like, sir, three weeks ago, you were questioned in Arizona that, and you stated that you were going to look into the collapse of Building 7 and some of the unanswered questions of the family members.
[01:09:28.973 --> 01:09:30.094]  You promised to look into this.
[01:09:30.154 --> 01:09:31.015]  Have you looked into this?
[01:09:31.539 --> 01:09:41.906]  John Edwards simply waved me off, and basically, I don't want to say ran away, walked away from me, stepped away from me, and then had his CFR go and step in front of me, and then didn't want to answer the question.
[01:09:42.166 --> 01:09:46.369]  Because three weeks ago, he was asked in Arizona, this question about Building 7, he promised to look into it.
[01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:47.250]  He ignored me.
[01:09:47.530 --> 01:09:59.318]  He's ignoring me, he's ignoring the family members, he's ignoring the rescue workers, and he's really, you know, Bill O'Byrne, he was a Bill O'Byrne in 2004, and you know, right after the CFR guys pushed me away, I told him, you know, you're just Bill O'Byrne scum.
[01:09:59.718 --> 01:10:00.619]  That's basically what he is.
[01:10:01.278 --> 01:10:05.120]  And we confronted him inside, and then when he was coming outside we also confronted him also out there.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.060]  And again, he ignored us.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.120]  What did you say when he came out?
[01:10:08.141 --> 01:10:09.241]  We asked him, we asked him again.
[01:10:09.361 --> 01:10:11.042]  Sir, did you do your homework like you promised?
[01:10:11.102 --> 01:10:15.183]  And he just, he basically, we really caught him off guard because he's mumbling.
[01:10:15.243 --> 01:10:18.945]  He didn't, he said 9-11, mumbled, and then he got in his car and started popping pills.
[01:10:19.285 --> 01:10:22.686]  I'm not, I mean, this is not, I mean, we have the video, you're going to see the video coming out soon.
[01:10:22.966 --> 01:10:25.147]  As soon as, I mean, I have a little computer, I'm going to start working on it.
[01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:27.028]  I'm going to do whatever I can.
[01:10:27.208 --> 01:10:29.549]  God knows what they're really taking.
[01:10:30.729 --> 01:10:37.791]  Now, just to be clear, I made a mistake in the first hour, because I just learned of this before we went on air today, and one of my producers, my wife, was on the phone.
[01:10:37.811 --> 01:10:41.972]  She says, Al Gore, so I was wrong when I ran in on here and said you guys confronted Al Gore.
[01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:42.672]  Oh yeah, we did.
[01:10:42.732 --> 01:10:43.212]  We did.
[01:10:43.232 --> 01:10:43.492]  We did.
[01:10:43.512 --> 01:10:44.833]  We confronted Al Gore Friday.
[01:10:44.913 --> 01:10:45.393]  Him, too.
[01:10:45.453 --> 01:10:46.173]  It just gets better.
[01:10:46.213 --> 01:10:47.213]  Oh, please, tell me then.
[01:10:47.633 --> 01:10:50.534]  Oh yeah, Al Gore was doing a big talk about his new book.
[01:10:51.127 --> 01:10:51.548]  I think so.
[01:11:08.966 --> 01:11:13.448]  Like, uh, Gary... That's right, once you're identified, like when I go places now, I'm the decoy.
[01:11:13.868 --> 01:11:17.329]  Or we use somebody with our pass as the decoy while our others with other passes get in.
[01:11:17.609 --> 01:11:23.472]  So good, you used their intelligence, uh, identifying you as a decoy.
[01:11:24.132 --> 01:11:24.552]  Well done!
[01:11:24.572 --> 01:11:28.193]  Yeah, we had Nate, Keith, and Gary confront him and ask him a question.
[01:11:28.233 --> 01:11:29.534]  We also have those videotapes.
[01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:32.195]  And, uh, yeah, we're gonna make another video about that also.
[01:11:32.675 --> 01:11:35.399]  And you know, it's pretty sick and ridiculous seeing the praise he gets.
[01:11:35.839 --> 01:11:38.523]  And he's just another, he's just the left wing of the New World Order.
[01:11:38.563 --> 01:11:40.605]  He's just the left wing of the globalists.
[01:11:41.066 --> 01:11:41.967]  Bush is the right wing.
[01:11:42.327 --> 01:11:44.189]  Gore is the left wing.
[01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:48.475]  And you confronted, at least the co-pilot when you confronted David Rockefeller.
[01:11:49.075 --> 01:11:52.997]  You weren't out there messing with the wings and, you know, polishing the wings.
[01:11:53.717 --> 01:12:03.702]  I mean, one major thing that really made me do the Rockefeller thing, because I was on a radio show, I was on your radio show about two weeks ago, and I was telling you about the death threats I've been receiving.
[01:12:04.162 --> 01:12:08.527]  And Sabrina Rivera is also the person that began receiving the death threats about me also.
[01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:18.659]  So it's me and her that have been receiving the death threats two weeks ago, and I just really wanted to make a statement to the elite, to the New World Order, to the power elite, that
[01:12:19.319 --> 01:12:20.219]  They're not going to scare us.
[01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:21.200]  They're not going to stop us.
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.100]  And they're going to threaten me.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:22.640]  That's right.
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:39.204]  And they need to know that, well that's why over the years they always tried to make the Trilateral Commission, CFR, Bilderberg's power secret because they are afraid of us learning that they're the real enemy and not their Clinton and Hillary and Bush and Schumer and all these puppets.
[01:12:39.684 --> 01:12:45.326]  And so they need to know that they need to call the dogs off you and other people or everybody's going to know who's guilty.
[01:12:45.925 --> 01:12:49.628]  Yeah, I mean, they killed 3,000 of my neighbors here in New York City.
[01:12:49.868 --> 01:12:52.670]  They injured 50,000 of the rescue workers here in New York City.
[01:12:52.910 --> 01:12:54.711]  And they're going to, you know, threaten me with that.
[01:12:54.731 --> 01:12:58.534]  They're going to threaten Sabrina with that just because we're trying to find justice.
[01:12:58.554 --> 01:12:58.834]  That's right.
[01:12:58.854 --> 01:12:59.775]  You have now crossed the line.
[01:12:59.815 --> 01:13:00.155]  You know what?
[01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:00.976]  I'm really sick of it.
[01:13:01.256 --> 01:13:03.057]  And I'm just going to take it to a whole nother level.
[01:13:03.097 --> 01:13:03.878]  They're not doing it.
[01:13:04.098 --> 01:13:05.519]  I'm going to take it to another level.
[01:13:05.699 --> 01:13:06.620]  You know, they want to do that?
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:08.541]  Well, we're going to go to Dave Rock with ourselves.
[01:13:08.561 --> 01:13:09.142]  They want to do that?
[01:13:09.202 --> 01:13:10.302]  I'll sneak into the CFR.
[01:13:10.583 --> 01:13:12.424]  Keep doing it, and I'll keep stepping it up.
[01:13:12.464 --> 01:13:14.245]  That's what I want to say to people listening out there.
[01:13:14.425 --> 01:13:15.346]  That's what I'm doing.
[01:13:15.667 --> 01:13:20.783]  Exactly, and Luke, I know I haven't talked to you about this, but I'm going to ask you.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:26.383]  Going past the point of no return that I did many years ago feels so good.
[01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:34.708]  You know, they say, like the Janis Joplin song, freedom is just another word for nothing left to lose, or like V for Vendetta, you know, now you're completely free.
[01:13:35.389 --> 01:13:47.777]  Once you commit, it doesn't mean you want to die, it doesn't mean you seek death, it means you know these people are trash, you know they've been hurting innocent people, you know you're standing up for the little children worldwide, and you just image their faces and there's no more fear.
[01:13:48.337 --> 01:13:56.883]  When you realize you're standing up for the innocence in this world, and God is it beautiful and wonderful and holy, and when you realize that you're literally guardians of that, there's no more fear.
[01:13:56.943 --> 01:14:06.489]  I mean, look, since you, or maybe you never had fear, but since you went past your fear and extinguished it, since you committed and went to the next level, what is it like?
[01:14:07.129 --> 01:14:08.931]  I mean, it's beautiful.
[01:14:08.971 --> 01:14:10.953]  I mean, it's beautiful doing something great.
[01:14:10.993 --> 01:14:13.375]  It's beautiful doing something for the youth, for the kids.
[01:14:13.475 --> 01:14:18.900]  It's beautiful saving this country, saving this world from these elite, crazy, sick globalists.
[01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:19.901]  I mean, that's what it's about.
[01:14:19.941 --> 01:14:20.761]  That's what life's about.
[01:14:20.821 --> 01:14:22.463]  It's not about materialistic items.
[01:14:22.723 --> 01:14:23.644]  It's not about cars.
[01:14:23.884 --> 01:14:25.165]  It's about doing the right thing.
[01:14:25.205 --> 01:14:26.947]  It's about effecting change in people.
[01:14:27.247 --> 01:14:28.128]  Doing the right thing.
[01:14:28.468 --> 01:14:30.009]  And really standing up for what's right.
[01:14:30.249 --> 01:14:31.409]  And that's what it's really about.
[01:14:31.929 --> 01:14:33.470]  And you know, death threats are no death threats.
[01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:36.210]  I'm going to keep doing the right thing and I think people shouldn't be discouraged.
[01:14:36.230 --> 01:14:38.351]  I think people should be encouraged and do more.
[01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:39.751]  Do an action on every element.
[01:14:39.951 --> 01:14:40.832]  Do a street action.
[01:14:41.012 --> 01:14:45.033]  You know, we do, I mean, we've been doing street actions here for about three and a half to four years.
[01:14:45.373 --> 01:14:45.674]  I'm good.
[01:15:05.544 --> 01:15:12.566]  Well done, and now you've gone to the next level of not just going to Silverstein's office, not just going to the CFR, now you're going to their houses.
[01:15:13.186 --> 01:15:14.226]  I mean, that's what it's about, man.
[01:15:14.267 --> 01:15:17.908]  It's about sending them a message and telling them that we're not scared, because we're not scared.
[01:15:18.148 --> 01:15:19.968]  And we will never stop, no matter what.
[01:15:20.208 --> 01:15:24.429]  They can try whatever they want, but they can't stop the word of truth, and they're losing, and we're winning.
[01:15:24.689 --> 01:15:26.450]  And we're going to take this country back, no matter what.
[01:15:29.032 --> 01:15:29.673]  Absolutely.
[01:15:29.713 --> 01:15:39.980]  If we didn't have the churches telling Christians to lay down and it's all a foregone conclusion, we would have already saved this country and the march against evil would be that much greater.
[01:15:40.341 --> 01:15:45.885]  And that's what God tells us to do, but instead the churches are completely run by what did his grandfather set up?
[01:15:46.545 --> 01:15:49.267]  Council of Churches, now World Council of Churches.
[01:15:49.828 --> 01:15:52.850]  Rockefeller literally chairs or co-chairs every one of those groups.
[01:15:54.111 --> 01:15:55.432]  And they're bringing down this country.
[01:15:56.368 --> 01:15:57.148]  That's what it's about.
[01:15:57.488 --> 01:16:01.150]  I wish more people... I mean, I'm kind of mad because not enough people have been rising up.
[01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:02.310]  Just rise up.
[01:16:02.390 --> 01:16:03.671]  I mean, these people are evil, man.
[01:16:03.711 --> 01:16:05.751]  Just do right and do good.
[01:16:05.791 --> 01:16:06.712]  And that's what it's about.
[01:16:06.772 --> 01:16:08.092]  And people need to understand, man.
[01:16:08.352 --> 01:16:09.733]  We have a short time in this world.
[01:16:09.973 --> 01:16:11.834]  We have a short time we're living the life we're living in.
[01:16:12.054 --> 01:16:14.054]  And we might as well make it the best thing that we're doing.
[01:16:14.214 --> 01:16:15.895]  We might as well make it better for our kids.
[01:16:16.115 --> 01:16:16.975]  For our kids' kids.
[01:16:17.175 --> 01:16:17.856]  For the future.
[01:16:18.036 --> 01:16:18.856]  And that's what it's about.
[01:16:18.896 --> 01:16:20.257]  It's about taking these guys down.
[01:16:20.297 --> 01:16:21.717]  We're going to go right to your house.
[01:16:21.957 --> 01:16:22.697]  Keep threatening me.
[01:16:22.838 --> 01:16:23.958]  I mean, I'll step it up.
[01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:25.987]  Absolutely.
[01:16:26.027 --> 01:16:28.748]  Luke, let me real fast talk to Sabrina Rivera.
[01:16:29.588 --> 01:16:30.129]  Sabrina?
[01:16:30.509 --> 01:16:31.109]  Yes, hi.
[01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:31.689]  I'm here.
[01:16:32.069 --> 01:16:37.511]  So you've been... Luke told me privately, but he didn't want to talk about it a few weeks ago, about the threats you've been getting.
[01:16:38.131 --> 01:16:40.092]  Without using profanity, what are they saying to you?
[01:16:40.912 --> 01:16:45.354]  Basically, you know, if I don't stop associating with him, they're gonna kill me.
[01:16:46.034 --> 01:16:50.796]  That was basically, you know, that was their whole, you know... Describe it word for word.
[01:16:50.816 --> 01:16:51.316]  What do they say?
[01:16:51.926 --> 01:16:56.229]  Well, the first call I received, Luke actually spoke about it on your show.
[01:16:56.629 --> 01:17:05.535]  He talked about he was going away for the weekend and no one knew about it, but him and I, maybe two other people, and the two other people were the ones that were going on vacation with him.
[01:17:06.596 --> 01:17:12.420]  So, it was a girl voice, called me and said, oh, I know where he's going to be and everything.
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:14.641]  And then the second call I received was from a male.
[01:17:15.021 --> 01:17:18.984]  And he just said, if I don't stop with this movement, if I don't stop, you know,
[01:17:20.012 --> 01:17:21.753]  Dealing with Luke that they're going to kill me.
[01:17:22.914 --> 01:17:24.755]  Yeah, they're scared and they should be scared.
[01:17:25.155 --> 01:17:26.796]  Yeah, you know, they are scared.
[01:17:26.816 --> 01:17:36.581]  They're really scared because the truth is coming out and people are accepting it and they're scared that, you know, their whole plan of this new world order is going to really go down the drain and it will.
[01:17:37.581 --> 01:17:40.242]  They're literally saying we have a new enemy.
[01:17:40.683 --> 01:17:40.903]  Yes.
[01:17:41.183 --> 01:17:48.287]  And by the way, Estilyn two years ago at Bilderberg confirmed that one of the main focuses was the Patriot movement in the U.S.
[01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:48.947]  Right.
[01:17:50.091 --> 01:17:50.971]  Well, God bless you.
[01:17:51.011 --> 01:17:55.012]  I want to get a report from you guys tomorrow on what happens tonight with Giuliani and Sabrina.
[01:17:55.052 --> 01:17:56.232]  It's great to have you on the team.
[01:17:56.272 --> 01:17:56.792]  God bless you.
[01:17:56.812 --> 01:17:57.153]  All right.
[01:17:57.193 --> 01:17:57.653]  Thank you.
[01:17:57.733 --> 01:17:58.313]  Thank you very much.
[01:17:58.693 --> 01:17:59.053]  You bet.
[01:17:59.113 --> 01:18:00.753]  If I can briefly talk to Tom Foti.
[01:18:01.894 --> 01:18:02.194]  Tom?
[01:18:02.354 --> 01:18:02.994]  Yeah, right here, Alex.
[01:18:03.474 --> 01:18:05.874]  Tom, you got about 30 seconds before we end this segment.
[01:18:05.974 --> 01:18:06.795]  Any other key points?
[01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:15.176]  First, I just want to talk about Matt Rapacek, who is also there with the Giuliani questioning this morning and, you know, had some good questions in there.
[01:18:15.657 --> 01:18:16.817]  And secondly, you know,
[01:18:17.785 --> 01:18:21.468]  Hey, somebody in our group said the way to combat this is to be happy.
[01:18:21.808 --> 01:18:22.789]  We shouldn't be afraid.
[01:18:23.009 --> 01:18:23.789]  We should feel good.
[01:18:24.250 --> 01:18:28.393]  Because in a way, it's going to be a revolution.
[01:18:28.673 --> 01:18:30.254]  But in a bigger way, it's an evolution.
[01:18:30.594 --> 01:18:36.179]  And I think what we need to do is call on our own courage.
[01:18:36.619 --> 01:18:39.921]  And as we find our own courage and spread it, we're going to win.
[01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:40.722]  Plain and simple.
[01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.426]  Spreading the Courage!
[01:18:44.007 --> 01:18:50.154]  Alright, Luke Radowski, Tom Foti, Sabrina Rivera, God bless you all.
[01:18:50.234 --> 01:18:51.376]  Our prayers go with you.
[01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:54.331]  Terrorism!
[01:18:54.471 --> 01:18:55.231]  Terrorism!
[01:18:55.331 --> 01:19:01.396]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:19:01.656 --> 01:19:03.258]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:19:03.498 --> 01:19:05.980]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:20.931]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:19:20.971 --> 01:19:21.291]  government.
[01:19:21.472 --> 01:19:23.273]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:19:23.633 --> 01:19:29.534]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:19:29.674 --> 01:19:34.155]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:19:52.941 --> 01:19:53.401]  Gold.
[01:19:53.741 --> 01:19:55.022]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:55.262 --> 01:20:01.364]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:01.544 --> 01:20:05.366]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:05.726 --> 01:20:07.606]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:07.646 --> 01:20:09.947]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:10.087 --> 01:20:16.990]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker and
[01:20:17.190 --> 01:20:18.091]  We're good to go.
[01:20:32.968 --> 01:20:38.592]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.

[01:20:52.526 --> 01:20:55.247]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:20:55.687 --> 01:20:57.988]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[01:20:58.288 --> 01:21:01.370]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:21:01.850 --> 01:21:03.991]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:21:04.171 --> 01:21:05.552]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[01:21:05.812 --> 01:21:09.933]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[01:21:10.254 --> 01:21:13.375]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:21:13.675 --> 01:21:14.916]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[01:21:16.136 --> 01:21:24.401]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.

[01:21:52.219 --> 01:21:54.700]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:22:01.603]  Did you know that at the 29 Palm Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[01:22:02.323 --> 01:22:05.664]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[01:22:06.344 --> 01:22:07.865]  Would the Marines accept this?
[01:22:07.985 --> 01:22:18.549]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[01:22:19.230 --> 01:22:20.631]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:22:20.771 --> 01:22:22.573]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[01:22:23.094 --> 01:22:30.682]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:31.443 --> 01:22:32.945]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:38.731 --> 01:22:41.452]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:43.953 --> 01:22:44.953]  Call now.
[01:22:45.133 --> 01:22:51.595]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:53.156 --> 01:22:55.137]  Yeah, here I come now, baby!
[01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:13.376]  It just gets my blood up in a big way to see more and more people getting fired up, rising up, and taking it right to the enemy.
[01:23:14.457 --> 01:23:19.300]  I can just envision that up-close video of David Rockefeller as he's confronted for his crimes.
[01:23:20.661 --> 01:23:31.487]  I can just see the wickedness in his eyes captured for the world to witness so the people can begin to learn who their true mortal enemies are.
[01:23:32.228 --> 01:23:34.029]  Here I come again now
[01:23:38.662 --> 01:23:41.565]  Yeah, it's me by the camera now, baby.
[01:23:42.185 --> 01:23:43.426]  I'd like to talk to you.
[01:23:43.446 --> 01:23:50.012]  Now I've been smoking for so long, you know I'm getting sick.
[01:23:58.738 --> 01:24:00.379]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:00.399 --> 01:24:02.860]  Alright, I've got Second Amendment news coming up.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:10.545]  I'm going to have this desk on from the Illinois Rifle Association for about 10 minutes to give you an update on what's happening with hardcore gun control coming down a big way.
[01:24:11.205 --> 01:24:18.249]  A poor tend of what will happen to the rest of the country unless we just take this nation back from the arch-criminals running absolutely wild all over us.
[01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:27.254]  Tony Snow, Dick Cheney, all of them are full court press everywhere, radio, TV, print, saying it's not amnesty,
[01:24:28.348 --> 01:24:30.230]  I'm saying it gets tough on the illegals.
[01:24:30.951 --> 01:24:33.874]  We've gotten subsections of the still secret bill.
[01:24:33.914 --> 01:24:35.956]  That's your clue right there, telling you it's secret.
[01:24:37.217 --> 01:24:38.859]  But we've now gotten subsections.
[01:24:38.899 --> 01:24:43.344]  It's basically a carbon copy of the previous Kennedy bill.
[01:24:43.364 --> 01:24:47.168]  That's why the Mexican president, that's why Ted Kennedy's supporting it.
[01:24:48.569 --> 01:24:49.871]  Total blanket amnesty.
[01:24:51.733 --> 01:24:59.883]  And then they've got the nerve to be all over talk radio and television saying it's non-amnesty and having a few token illegal aliens run around and protest it to fool you!
[01:25:00.771 --> 01:25:01.932]  That's nothing but a device.
[01:25:01.972 --> 01:25:03.633]  They get the illegals out protesting it.
[01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:06.235]  So everybody goes, oh look, the illegals are protesting it.
[01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:07.716]  And these people are slick.
[01:25:07.736 --> 01:25:25.708]  It's like the Federal Reserve, in 1910, 1911, 1912, for three years, buying time on newspapers, buying up newspapers, and then attacking themselves in editorials, saying don't have the Federal Reserve Act, don't have the Federal Reserve Act, you know, as if the bankers were criticizing it.
[01:25:26.308 --> 01:25:30.551]  They play these tricks, and they're just your enemies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:32.296 --> 01:25:36.839]  Bottom line, I mean, why even decipher the lies?
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.501]  It's total lies.
[01:25:38.841 --> 01:25:39.862]  Go research it for yourself.
[01:25:40.562 --> 01:25:42.463]  What it does is the same thing with the border fence.
[01:25:42.483 --> 01:25:47.567]  Remember, oh, give us $5 billion for a border fence, and $2 billion will be assigned directly to it.
[01:25:47.587 --> 01:25:50.329]  And then they get the money, and they go, oh, we're giving that to the war.
[01:25:50.349 --> 01:25:51.370]  We're going to send that to the war.
[01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:54.012]  We're not going to build any fence.
[01:25:54.838 --> 01:25:57.539]  Because the bureaucracy decides how the money's spent.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:06.243]  And so what we've gotten to this bill is it's got some language about $5,000 or up to $6,150 for people.
[01:26:07.264 --> 01:26:13.407]  But if you read it, you don't have to leave the country, the Z Visa, they don't have to enforce that, they can waiver it.
[01:26:15.468 --> 01:26:17.328]  It's a lie to say it's 12 to 14 mil, well over 30 mil.
[01:26:19.381 --> 01:26:21.023]  It's just all lies!
[01:26:21.163 --> 01:26:27.108]  So yeah, there's some flowery talk about stopping illegal aliens, but what they do is... Let me just give you the bottom line on this.
[01:26:27.388 --> 01:26:27.928]  Forevermore.
[01:26:27.988 --> 01:26:28.589]  This is what it does.
[01:26:30.613 --> 01:26:37.759]  If the illegal aliens want to become legalized, they are instantly legalized if they take a North American ID card.
[01:26:38.119 --> 01:26:40.001]  It's the same standardized Real ID Act.
[01:26:40.241 --> 01:26:52.090]  But then citizens that have a job are going to have to have this too, but then it's all going to be selectively enforced, and they'll prosecute a few thousand illegal aliens a year and their employers, which isn't even a drop in the bucket.
[01:26:55.146 --> 01:26:56.047]  Now that's what they're going to do.
[01:26:56.227 --> 01:26:59.250]  It's nothing but a regional North American ID card.
[01:26:59.510 --> 01:27:01.552]  Ridge said that three and a half years ago on C-SPAN.
[01:27:01.592 --> 01:27:03.794]  I've talked about it a lot, but that's the bottom line.
[01:27:05.615 --> 01:27:08.958]  And you'll have a national ID card, and then you'll have to have it or you're arrested.
[01:27:08.978 --> 01:27:12.661]  Your employer will have to have it as a citizen, but then the illegal aliens won't have to.
[01:27:12.681 --> 01:27:14.603]  Okay, that's how this is going to work.
[01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:15.704]  Hope you enjoy it.
[01:27:15.764 --> 01:27:16.985]  It's a bait-and-switch as usual.
[01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:24.208]  So it is the full integration of the Real ID Act for the North American Union in the SPP documents.
[01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:26.070]  We already knew that from Ridge, but now it's public.
[01:27:26.850 --> 01:27:29.912]  And it's all selectively enforced, just like Homeland Security three months ago.
[01:27:29.932 --> 01:27:31.293]  Remember Bank of America made news?
[01:27:31.513 --> 01:27:32.594]  Been going on for four years.
[01:27:33.054 --> 01:27:39.979]  But it made news when they decided to go ahead and accept bank accounts and credit cards for illegals with no ID, no verifiable ID.
[01:27:41.545 --> 01:27:43.866]  And then Homeland Security looked at it and said it was okay?
[01:27:44.407 --> 01:27:46.708]  Now, have you had any questions about this?
[01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:49.710]  Have you had any questions about any of it?
[01:27:50.990 --> 01:27:51.651]  There it is!
[01:27:52.331 --> 01:27:58.514]  They don't have to have IDs to get bank accounts, car loans, housing loans, and credit cards.
[01:27:58.755 --> 01:27:59.275]  Period!
[01:28:00.956 --> 01:28:02.437]  It's for you, schmucks!
[01:28:02.937 --> 01:28:04.538]  It's for you, right whales!
[01:28:05.529 --> 01:28:09.210]  And again, if you don't know what a right whale is, that was the whale that was sweet.
[01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:11.450]  They come up to divers and play with them and nudge them.
[01:28:11.470 --> 01:28:12.490]  They're just sweet animals.
[01:28:14.131 --> 01:28:15.551]  They got a lot of fat on them.
[01:28:15.571 --> 01:28:16.311]  A lot of oil.
[01:28:17.411 --> 01:28:18.631]  And they called it the right whale.
[01:28:18.691 --> 01:28:19.632]  It was the right one.
[01:28:19.752 --> 01:28:20.772]  It was the one they wanted to kill.
[01:28:22.612 --> 01:28:23.612]  And they almost killed them.
[01:28:23.632 --> 01:28:24.613]  They were down to a couple hundred.
[01:28:25.973 --> 01:28:27.053]  Because they were so friendly.
[01:28:27.613 --> 01:28:28.493]  And they were so stupid.
[01:28:29.253 --> 01:28:30.054]  Compared to other whales.
[01:28:31.534 --> 01:28:32.334]  I'm not a right whale.
[01:28:33.738 --> 01:28:35.479]  I'm a sperm whale and I'm gonna attack your boats.
[01:28:43.443 --> 01:28:44.344]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.844 --> 01:28:46.445]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.365 --> 01:28:50.047]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.303 --> 01:28:54.943]  Not making the money you were expecting?
[01:28:55.103 --> 01:28:56.924]  Signing into the hottest new MLM business?
[01:28:57.184 --> 01:28:59.124]  It's not that that business is not performing.
[01:28:59.344 --> 01:29:01.645]  It's simply that you don't have the proper tools to succeed.
[01:29:01.845 --> 01:29:05.206]  Take it from me, Craig Walcott, producer of Exercise is Suicide.
[01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:10.687]  Being in the MLM business since 1989, I've learned what it takes to be successful in any business venture.
[01:29:10.907 --> 01:29:12.828]  And I'm here to share those amazing tools with you.

[01:29:54.215 --> 01:30:01.000]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:07.765]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[01:30:08.246 --> 01:30:18.153]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[01:30:18.633 --> 01:30:22.096]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[01:30:22.396 --> 01:30:25.078]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[01:30:25.698 --> 01:30:28.400]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.881]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.
[01:30:30.901 --> 01:30:31.621]  Box 969 Soquel, S-O-Q-U-E-L, California 95073.
[01:30:31.782 --> 01:30:35.644]  $32 to Radio Liberty Box 969 Soquel, California 95073 or call 1-800-544-8927.
[01:30:35.664 --> 01:30:35.724]  1-800-544-8927.
[01:30:53.783 --> 01:31:04.792]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[01:31:04.992 --> 01:31:11.497]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[01:31:11.677 --> 01:31:19.323]  By using organics and enzymes to step up the body's ability to absorb more freely, the body begins to respond by taking in the missing nutrient.
[01:31:19.563 --> 01:31:20.244]  As it responds,
[01:31:20.524 --> 01:31:22.526]  Body odor will then no longer be an issue.
[01:31:22.826 --> 01:31:26.329]  First Responder is the first of its kind, comprised of only four organics.
[01:31:26.629 --> 01:31:29.912]  Grape seed skim, grape seed, grapefruit seed, and garlic.
[01:31:30.273 --> 01:31:34.757]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[01:31:35.057 --> 01:31:37.619]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[01:31:37.859 --> 01:31:41.342]  Go online and order First Responder at No-BO.com.
[01:31:41.603 --> 01:31:44.926]  Visit No-BO.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[01:31:47.788 --> 01:31:48.008]  That's 850-723-8599.
[01:32:17.916 --> 01:32:18.944]  Yeah.
[01:32:42.842 --> 01:32:43.842]  I think so.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:12.704]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride
[01:33:31.644 --> 01:33:52.071]  With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[01:33:54.243 --> 01:33:55.044]  I went aloft.
[01:33:55.524 --> 01:34:00.768]  And when the yards broke off...
[01:34:24.082 --> 01:34:31.307]  And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed, but I'm living still.
[01:34:36.191 --> 01:34:45.457]  I was a dam building across a river deep and wide, where steel and water built a lie.
[01:34:50.208 --> 01:34:56.492]  You can see InfoWars.com reporter Sabrina Rivera right now on the Drugs Report.
[01:34:56.532 --> 01:34:57.572]  We've now got the audio.
[01:34:57.592 --> 01:34:59.333]  That's why I was a little bit late getting on.
[01:35:00.194 --> 01:35:08.298]  While I was talking to them during the last break, they were getting calls from New York Daily News, Associated Press, and they didn't know what was going on.
[01:35:09.173 --> 01:35:18.318]  And so then I called him back and I said, it's on Drudge right now, the video of Sabrina confronting him right there this morning.
[01:35:19.478 --> 01:35:21.019]  And so it's just pandemonium.
[01:35:21.099 --> 01:35:23.340]  You wait till that David Rockefeller video gets out.
[01:35:24.241 --> 01:35:27.843]  You wait till the video of them inside the CFR, where John Edwards gets out.
[01:35:27.863 --> 01:35:31.144]  But this Giuliani thing, I knew that'd be the thing the media would pick up on.
[01:35:31.625 --> 01:35:32.625]  So we've got that audio.
[01:35:32.645 --> 01:35:34.226]  It's coming up here in just a little while.
[01:35:35.046 --> 01:35:35.907]  How exciting.
[01:35:37.193 --> 01:35:42.437]  But to give us about a 10-minute report, and I appreciate him coming on, is Richard Pearson, Illinois State Rifle Association.
[01:35:43.477 --> 01:35:45.399]  We've had Richard on before, if memory serves.
[01:35:45.979 --> 01:35:48.381]  And there's massive gun control coming down in Illinois.
[01:35:48.401 --> 01:35:55.345]  They're trying similar things around the country to ban magazines that the police can force one more bullet into your bag, which they do routinely.
[01:35:55.666 --> 01:35:57.047]  You'll spend many years in prison.
[01:35:57.447 --> 01:36:04.572]  They're also raiding 75, 85, 90-plus-year-old people's houses routinely who are bedridden, who don't re-update their yearly
[01:36:05.032 --> 01:36:05.933]  I don't know.
[01:36:25.578 --> 01:36:29.243]  Also, a gun group objects to police taking part in a gun store protest.
[01:36:29.283 --> 01:36:33.088]  The police now are becoming totally anti-gun in Illinois for their mob boss.
[01:36:33.409 --> 01:36:35.271]  Richard Pearson, thank you for joining us.
[01:36:36.372 --> 01:36:37.334]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[01:36:38.374 --> 01:36:39.454]  You've got the floor, sir.
[01:36:39.514 --> 01:36:40.534]  Tell us about what's happening.
[01:36:40.554 --> 01:36:46.916]  Tell us about what the cops are becoming up there, openly working for the Mafia, and what we face.
[01:36:47.676 --> 01:36:50.296]  Well, we're looking at all kinds of legislation in Illinois.
[01:36:50.396 --> 01:36:56.457]  One would ban, say, it's nearly impossible to privately sell a handgun to another person.
[01:36:57.757 --> 01:36:59.318]  Magazine bans, of course.
[01:37:00.118 --> 01:37:07.019]  You're losing your FOID card if you forget to, or if you simply don't report the theft of your gun.
[01:37:10.811 --> 01:37:11.271]  We're good to go.
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:37.401]  Right now in Illinois, we have a majority of legislators who do not support gun control.
[01:37:38.041 --> 01:37:41.242]  So they're calling for them to be snuffed out.
[01:37:41.322 --> 01:37:44.843]  So it's a pretty exciting time here in Illinois.
[01:37:47.143 --> 01:37:48.104]  Please continue, sir.
[01:37:49.384 --> 01:37:52.465]  So anyway, if you would like to hear that, we have a website.
[01:37:52.505 --> 01:37:58.306]  We actually have the statements of Father Plager up on the website, and you can play it on your computer.
[01:37:59.134 --> 01:38:13.200]  It's on MP3 and there's a way to get to the website and to play that, what he said about sloughing out John Riggio owns Chuck's Gun Shop there in Riverdale, Illinois.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:19.362]  And you can hear all this right on the website and see pictures of the protest right there.
[01:38:19.382 --> 01:38:21.603]  Of course we had a counter-protest.
[01:38:22.533 --> 01:38:24.034]  We had 70 people show up.
[01:38:24.795 --> 01:38:34.221]  We had motorcyclists, truck drivers coming in and the truckers blocked the attack on the gun shop and that sort of thing.
[01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:39.405]  So we're not laying down and we're not taking in nor judging anybody across the country.
[01:38:40.251 --> 01:38:54.538]  But what makes me worry about some of this is that we see this legislation, it happens in maybe Maryland or New Jersey, California, then Illinois, but they're planning to transport it to every state and union, whether it's Wyoming or Montana.
[01:38:55.538 --> 01:38:56.078]  We're good to go.
[01:39:11.204 --> 01:39:16.549]  Coast-to-coast, using the newspapers as weapons against the people of intimidation and fear.
[01:39:17.370 --> 01:39:23.355]  They are also suing gun manufacturers strategically through the state level, which we still haven't gotten proper protection for.
[01:39:24.056 --> 01:39:32.744]  In the words of NRA board member, former congressman Bob Barr, things have been more anti-gun under Bush than they were under Clinton because of the stealth nature of it.
[01:39:32.984 --> 01:39:34.766]  We are in a red-level emergency.
[01:39:35.366 --> 01:39:38.407]  Now we have police openly protesting to shut down the gun shops.
[01:39:38.767 --> 01:39:42.188]  Red-level emergency when the police are literally out in the open.
[01:39:42.409 --> 01:39:49.431]  They got their training in New Orleans with the FBI and military taking guns in even the wealthy neighborhoods.
[01:39:49.471 --> 01:39:51.652]  They're not playing games, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:51.832 --> 01:39:53.492]  They're making their move on open borders.
[01:39:53.672 --> 01:39:55.233]  They're making their move on gun control.
[01:39:55.373 --> 01:39:56.754]  They're making their move on Iran.
[01:39:57.334 --> 01:40:03.616]  Bush has announced covert ops to intensify using, this is mainstream news, known Al-Qaeda groups to attack the Iranians.
[01:40:04.337 --> 01:40:05.899]  We have entered the Ninth Circle here.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:08.122]  This is just out of control, sir.
[01:40:08.162 --> 01:40:12.508]  How do we help you defeat this on the front lines of gun control in Illinois?
[01:40:13.146 --> 01:40:17.750]  Well, we're certainly on the front lines, and people can keep up on this with our website.
[01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:27.078]  I do a daily report when I'm here in Springfield, and we're nearing the end of session, but in Illinois, the legislation won't go away just because the session ends.
[01:40:27.699 --> 01:40:32.863]  It will be alive until 2009, this particular set of legislation.
[01:40:32.883 --> 01:40:36.967]  So, staffing into our website, you know, anything you can do for us.
[01:40:37.067 --> 01:40:40.130]  It takes a lot of money to fight this, so we have a way to donate.
[01:40:40.630 --> 01:40:45.517]  We have a way to join and we take memberships from all over the country and we would really appreciate your help.
[01:40:46.579 --> 01:40:48.562]  Now, what about getting these police in trouble?
[01:40:48.622 --> 01:40:53.649]  How many of these un-American traitors were out there protesting for shutting down gun shops?
[01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:54.931]  How many of them were part of this evil?
[01:40:55.815 --> 01:40:58.799]  Well, there were about 200 people total, you know.
[01:40:59.379 --> 01:41:05.446]  And of course, Chicago always sends their group out to wherever, you know, they're on the police payroll probably.
[01:41:06.147 --> 01:41:09.050]  And so they come out and they do this.
[01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:12.414]  They're trying to get legislation in Illinois that a Chicago cop
[01:41:12.854 --> 01:41:20.864]  Well, yeah, that's part of Imperium.
[01:41:20.884 --> 01:41:27.533]  That reverses back to the city-state making the nation-state, literally going and dominating all the local communities.
[01:41:27.593 --> 01:41:28.354]  I did see that.
[01:41:28.374 --> 01:41:29.855]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:31.661]  Well, yeah.
[01:41:31.821 --> 01:41:35.743]  These people are always saying that the gun owners are wacko.
[01:41:36.163 --> 01:41:42.607]  Well, you're publicly calling to snuff out legislators and gun shop owners who have done nothing wrong.
[01:41:43.368 --> 01:41:44.849]  I don't think we're the wacko ones.
[01:41:44.909 --> 01:41:45.329]  They are.
[01:41:45.509 --> 01:41:46.310]  It's real simple.
[01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:48.931]  Since the days of Capone, that city's been mafia-run.
[01:41:49.332 --> 01:41:51.053]  It's mafia-run publicly now.
[01:41:51.373 --> 01:41:59.578]  And they don't... I mean, do you think criminals and their criminal police that work for them... And it's well known in Chicago, one of the dirtiest cities in the nation, probably the dirtiest,
[01:42:00.118 --> 01:42:01.039]  It's a nice city, by the way.
[01:42:01.059 --> 01:42:02.299]  Too bad you've got criminals running it.
[01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:05.321]  They want their slaves disarmed.
[01:42:05.541 --> 01:42:09.324]  Do you think mafia wants people they're pushing around and extorting?
[01:42:11.145 --> 01:42:14.947]  Cops in Chicago, by the way, still routinely extort family businesses.
[01:42:15.127 --> 01:42:17.829]  This is the way America rolls now.
[01:42:17.989 --> 01:42:19.830]  They want their extortion to go unabated.
[01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:21.711]  They want to bring in their illegals unabated.
[01:42:22.031 --> 01:42:23.392]  They want to have their way with America.
[01:42:23.932 --> 01:42:27.496]  And it's time we... I mean, I call for Mayor Daley to be arrested for high treason.
[01:42:27.836 --> 01:42:29.938]  I call for the police chief to be arrested for high treason.
[01:42:30.218 --> 01:42:33.501]  I call for all of them to be arrested for engaging in treason against this country.
[01:42:33.922 --> 01:42:38.266]  And I'm sick and tired of them, and I can't wait till we take this country back and arrest every single one of them.
[01:42:38.526 --> 01:42:39.487]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:42:40.447 --> 01:42:45.131]  Well, that's about it, but keep an eye on Illinois because it is coming your way.
[01:42:45.151 --> 01:42:48.233]  If you think that they're stopping at Illinois, it's just starting at Illinois.
[01:42:48.593 --> 01:42:49.134]  No, I know.
[01:42:49.414 --> 01:42:58.621]  You are the front line, just like we're the front line of the running over the borders and the foreign corporations grabbing all the waterways and railways and just everything else.
[01:42:58.641 --> 01:43:00.702]  They're just attacking us from every angle.
[01:43:01.503 --> 01:43:06.907]  God bless you, sir, and I really appreciate you coming on, Richard, and I appreciate you spending time with us.
[01:43:06.927 --> 01:43:08.068]  Give that website out again again.
[01:43:08.781 --> 01:43:11.303]  www.isra.org.
[01:43:11.483 --> 01:43:13.545]  We got links to it on infowars.com.
[01:43:13.845 --> 01:43:15.887]  God bless you and our prayers go with you.
[01:43:16.327 --> 01:43:16.707]  Thank you.
[01:43:16.767 --> 01:43:17.288]  I need them all.
[01:43:17.788 --> 01:43:18.188]  All right.
[01:43:18.248 --> 01:43:19.389]  We all do, my friend.
[01:43:19.489 --> 01:43:21.051]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:43:21.511 --> 01:43:22.952]  Let's just start calling them what they are.
[01:43:22.992 --> 01:43:32.739]  A bunch of slack-jawed mob bosses with a bunch of monkeys in uniforms thinking they can boss us around and shove us around and tell us what to do.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:34.101]  I'm sick of it!
[01:43:34.861 --> 01:43:37.143]  I'm sick of all the stuff you freaks have done!
[01:43:38.226 --> 01:43:40.208]  It's not enough that you own and run everything.
[01:43:40.248 --> 01:43:47.733]  Now you want to have one-child policies and take all what little property we've got left and have a bunch of foreigners run all over us.
[01:43:47.893 --> 01:43:49.074]  We're sick of it!
[01:43:50.335 --> 01:43:51.076]  We're angry!
[01:43:51.096 --> 01:43:52.357]  Have you figured it out yet?
[01:43:53.778 --> 01:43:56.180]  You dumb twits never know when to stop, do you?
[01:43:57.412 --> 01:44:02.835]  Bunch of cold-blooded old men, all you see is more money on a ballot sheet, more control, more domination for yourself.
[01:44:02.875 --> 01:44:03.955]  It's all a big game.
[01:44:04.296 --> 01:44:07.737]  This isn't a game, it's our lives you're talking about, you freaks!
[01:44:08.378 --> 01:44:09.378]  It's our lives!
[01:44:10.178 --> 01:44:11.079]  We have lives!
[01:44:11.139 --> 01:44:13.380]  We're living, breathing human beings!
[01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:17.022]  And we're tired of being run all over, and we're tired of a bunch of bullies.
[01:44:17.042 --> 01:44:17.882]  You know what government is?
[01:44:18.423 --> 01:44:24.806]  It's a business where they dress up in fancy outfits and fancy medallions and fancy cygnets and baubles and
[01:44:25.794 --> 01:44:34.360]  Tell you you've got to buy their service and it just gets worse and worse and worse with a bunch of crooks and their brainwashed toadies running all over us.
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:36.122]  You're a bunch of power mad scum!
[01:44:37.489 --> 01:44:55.744]  There was some story here out of Las Vegas where this 600-pound judge sits up there and she makes everybody clean her feet and massage her feet, the bailiff, and she's screaming and yelling at the cops and telling them that they're her slaves and they've got to cook her meals for her and show up an hour and a half before she gets to work at 6 in the morning.
[01:44:56.304 --> 01:45:03.907]  But the reason it's in the news is because she's been mean to the cops and mean to the... See, that's what the normal judges are like, folks.
[01:45:03.967 --> 01:45:05.007]  A lot of them are like that now.
[01:45:05.048 --> 01:45:08.689]  I've been in the courtrooms where they literally just sit up there and go, I rule!
[01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:12.811]  And everyone just bows to them, but they're smart and kiss up to the cops.
[01:45:14.891 --> 01:45:19.493]  This demon pig out of Las Vegas is in trouble, but they said there's nothing they can do.
[01:45:21.274 --> 01:45:23.895]  Because she's been bossing around her attack dogs.
[01:45:25.669 --> 01:45:27.030]  What do you think we live under?
[01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:32.992]  I've been there as the judges literally show teeth and their eyes literally are energized with evil, folks.
[01:45:33.192 --> 01:45:41.016]  I've seen glinting eyes, you know what I'm talking about, with pleasure, with big joker smiles as women cry as their babies are taken.
[01:45:41.376 --> 01:45:42.897]  I've seen the pleasure!
[01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:44.558]  You understand me?
[01:45:44.918 --> 01:45:47.119]  I've seen hell-raiser evil!
[01:45:47.699 --> 01:45:50.260]  I've seen it so many times that it changed me.
[01:45:50.721 --> 01:45:51.521]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:45:52.751 --> 01:46:00.161]  It changed me to see them rock their evil, build their evil in their forges, and then roll it out against us!
[01:46:00.662 --> 01:46:08.352]  And I see them building up their armies right now, I see them mashing for an even greater all-out assault against us, and I'm here blowing the trumpet!
[01:46:08.932 --> 01:46:09.452]  Gear up!
[01:46:09.512 --> 01:46:10.152]  Get ready!
[01:46:10.672 --> 01:46:15.914]  Right now, every Republican leader, every Democratic leader, are literally at the drawbridge.
[01:46:16.154 --> 01:46:31.697]  They are inside the gates, there with the wheel that lowers it, fighting with us, with everything they've got, telling us, I'm not trying to open the drawbridge, I'm not trying to open the drawbridge, as they push with everything they've got, as we try to rally to get you to struggle to hold the gate, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:31.957 --> 01:46:35.218]  They've already opened other gates, we've been flooded, but now the main throng
[01:46:35.578 --> 01:46:38.161]  Pouring in, energized by the New World Order.
[01:46:38.481 --> 01:46:39.983]  Everything coming down on us.
[01:46:40.303 --> 01:46:43.567]  Hitting us from every assault angle, every lie you can imagine.
[01:46:44.728 --> 01:46:48.071]  And I have to hear these idiots calling in to talk radio who are buying into it.
[01:46:48.111 --> 01:46:50.093]  All these phony conservatives, they have no idea.
[01:46:50.354 --> 01:46:52.116]  They want tyranny, you fools.
[01:46:52.376 --> 01:46:54.838]  So they can take your bank accounts, take your pension funds.
[01:46:56.100 --> 01:46:57.061]  You know why they're racing?
[01:46:57.759 --> 01:47:03.961]  Because they know when the economy completely implodes, and it can happen in a month, it can happen in two years, but they are designing it to happen.
[01:47:04.181 --> 01:47:07.862]  And the bubble is so big now, everyone's in marvel that it hasn't popped.
[01:47:08.183 --> 01:47:18.986]  It hasn't been popped yet because they know that riots are going to break out, cities are going to burn, people are going to throw fits, and that's what they want in the reorganization, but they only want it to a certain level.
[01:47:19.266 --> 01:47:27.129]  They know that right now, they haven't completely brainwashed us enough, they haven't flooded us with enough third world populations to play off against Americans,
[01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:31.271]  So they don't have everything in line yet, so they're hesitating.
[01:47:31.691 --> 01:47:32.772]  We can't hesitate.
[01:47:32.992 --> 01:47:41.057]  They realize they have built something so explosive that it's probably going to bring them down too, so they're holding back executing a final plan.
[01:47:41.397 --> 01:47:52.123]  We've got to rush in now and try to wrest control away from them with everything we've got, with viral understanding, viral revelation, viral renaissance.
[01:47:52.817 --> 01:48:06.142]  We have to understand, we have to be fearless, we have to be aggressive, we have to become men again and women again, and we've got to feel that fire, that fire of liberty and freedom literally burning in your breast.
[01:48:06.402 --> 01:48:09.223]  If you don't feel it, there's something wrong with you.
[01:48:09.503 --> 01:48:16.165]  If you don't feel the fire literally raging and burning like a volcano, exploding,
[01:48:16.725 --> 01:48:18.667]  Then there's something wrong with you.
[01:48:18.707 --> 01:48:27.997]  If you don't feel the evil breathing down our necks, and if you don't feel the lightning strength energizing you to resist it, there's something wrong with you.
[01:48:28.297 --> 01:48:30.520]  You need to break the spell they've got you under.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.240]  That's what it is.
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:37.607]  It is power by hypnosis, by the invisible cabal, by the imperial cabals.
[01:48:38.439 --> 01:48:39.980]  We must bring them down.
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:41.241]  We must defeat them.
[01:48:41.461 --> 01:48:43.342]  We must bring the Republic back.
[01:48:43.662 --> 01:48:47.345]  Because we are the front line of the New World Order's operation.
[01:48:47.385 --> 01:48:53.349]  We are the main engine they've been using to power and build their armies and their systems.
[01:48:53.729 --> 01:48:59.136]  They have sucked us dry and they're afraid that you're going to learn about how we've been sucked dry.
[01:48:59.356 --> 01:49:04.884]  Or they've almost sucked us dry and they want to finish sucking us dry like a spider sucks a bug dry.
[01:49:05.184 --> 01:49:11.913]  But there's still some energy, still some kick, we can still crush the spider with our mandibles like we're a big beetle.
[01:49:12.453 --> 01:49:16.016]  If we just lock on to the spider's neck, we can still defeat them.
[01:49:16.336 --> 01:49:20.519]  But they're busily sucking up what's left until we're lifeless, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:20.759 --> 01:49:28.304]  There's still time to get the liberty and get the freedom back, but it starts with you getting aggressive and getting aggressive now!
[01:49:28.624 --> 01:49:30.325]  I want you to ram down the doors.
[01:49:30.385 --> 01:49:34.828]  I want you to email PrisonPlanet.com's address out to everybody at InfoWars.com.
[01:49:35.128 --> 01:49:37.090]  I want you to go to the four corners of the web.
[01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:38.651]  I want you to move forward.
[01:49:38.871 --> 01:49:42.093]  I want you to take an audio file of this show today, and I want you
[01:49:42.353 --> 01:50:01.960]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.320 --> 01:50:09.923]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.652 --> 01:50:17.696]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.097 --> 01:50:29.524]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.844 --> 01:50:33.406]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.766 --> 01:50:35.727]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.067 --> 01:50:39.930]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:50:40.510 --> 01:50:47.838]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:50:53.234 --> 01:50:56.256]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:56.576 --> 01:51:01.499]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.759 --> 01:51:06.101]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.402 --> 01:51:15.307]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.527 --> 01:51:19.129]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.429 --> 01:51:24.472]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.752 --> 01:51:31.456]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.969 --> 01:51:32.630]  What about you?
[01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:38.614]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:51:53.388 --> 01:51:55.109]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.329 --> 01:51:59.032]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.352 --> 01:52:01.554]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.074 --> 01:52:08.278]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.439 --> 01:52:13.302]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.542 --> 01:52:22.547]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:08.107 --> 01:53:11.510]  The truth is, the globalists have a dictatorship now in the U.S.
[01:53:11.550 --> 01:53:16.294]  They control the legislative, executive, and judicial.
[01:53:17.675 --> 01:53:19.076]  Predominantly, they have dominance.
[01:53:20.737 --> 01:53:25.421]  They don't want to remove the last illusion that we're in a free country.
[01:53:26.962 --> 01:53:30.925]  And so that's why they're going, oh no, it's not amnesty and we're going to vote for it.
[01:53:31.205 --> 01:53:33.367]  We're doing what you want, it's not amnesty.
[01:53:36.593 --> 01:53:42.716]  You see, because they don't want to just really show you, and you're going to wonder why you can't go vote them out because there's so much election fraud.
[01:53:42.736 --> 01:53:43.957]  See, and that'll make you wake up further.
[01:53:47.419 --> 01:53:48.700]  They're in deep trouble when they know it.
[01:53:50.861 --> 01:53:55.883]  And a lot of people in the power system are now realizing that this thing isn't going to be as pretty as they were told down the road.
[01:53:55.904 --> 01:54:04.948]  Alright, we're going to start the third hour, and I'm going to just take about 15 calls or so the first half of that hour, and then I'm going to cover it.
[01:54:04.968 --> 01:54:05.849]  There's so much news.
[01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:09.923]  We've got the audio clip off the news where Giuliani gets confronted.
[01:54:09.963 --> 01:54:11.384]  That's coming up.
[01:54:11.824 --> 01:54:13.906]  And it has made national news on the drug report.
[01:54:13.926 --> 01:54:14.787]  It's on New York News.
[01:54:14.987 --> 01:54:15.728]  It's all over the place.
[01:54:15.828 --> 01:54:16.749]  Infowars.com.
[01:54:16.769 --> 01:54:20.132]  Reporters have now exposed Giuliani worldwide.
[01:54:20.192 --> 01:54:21.273]  It's made national news.
[01:54:23.154 --> 01:54:24.776]  Good job, Luke, and everybody else.
[01:54:24.796 --> 01:54:31.962]  That's why they got kind of demonized locally by some of the local groups who didn't want him going after the New World Order because, see, that's the real target.
[01:54:33.243 --> 01:54:33.864]  It's kind of sad.
[01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:42.132]  But whether it was for fear or whatever reasons, but that's why I've been trying to support Luke, sending him cameras and money and things like that.
[01:54:42.192 --> 01:54:43.893]  I know some of you have done that as well, so good job.
[01:54:44.253 --> 01:54:45.734]  Because I know when people are taking action.
[01:54:46.674 --> 01:54:47.714]  We all need to do this.
[01:54:49.135 --> 01:54:54.577]  Before I end this hour, I've been so busy I haven't even plugged my own videos yet.
[01:54:54.777 --> 01:54:55.757]  I'm just going to make it real simple.
[01:54:56.097 --> 01:54:57.938]  Terror Storm First Edition is almost sold out.
[01:54:57.978 --> 01:54:59.399]  I'm signing every copy that goes out.
[01:54:59.579 --> 01:55:00.159]  Signed card.
[01:55:00.739 --> 01:55:02.320]  It's almost sold out.
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:02.960]  Terror Storm
[01:55:03.912 --> 01:55:05.294]  Second edition, the final cut.
[01:55:05.514 --> 01:55:06.775]  It'll be out in late July.
[01:55:08.376 --> 01:55:09.157]  You want TerrorStorm?
[01:55:09.197 --> 01:55:10.218]  InfoWars.com.
[01:55:10.438 --> 01:55:12.701]  And it also supports us and makes what we do here possible.
[01:55:13.361 --> 01:55:15.783]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, great activist tool.
[01:55:15.804 --> 01:55:19.427]  Download all my films and TV shows, burn them to disk, give them to people.
[01:55:19.447 --> 01:55:19.987]  15 cents a day.
[01:55:20.168 --> 01:55:21.229]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:21.609 --> 01:55:23.351]  And we do need your support, so I hope you'll support us.
[01:55:24.372 --> 01:55:25.232]  Or call 888-253-3139 to order.
[01:55:29.565 --> 01:55:36.169]  888-253-3139 to get End Game, to get Terror Storm.
[01:55:36.249 --> 01:55:38.110]  End Game isn't out yet, folks, is what I'm thinking about.
[01:55:38.790 --> 01:55:43.032]  To get American Freedom to Fascism, to get Loose Change 2nd Edition, to get it all.
[01:55:44.973 --> 01:55:46.394]  And that's how you help us in this war.
[01:55:46.414 --> 01:55:49.856]  That's how you help the frontline troops is by going in there and recharging our batteries.
[01:55:49.896 --> 01:55:50.776]  That's really all it is.
[01:55:51.617 --> 01:55:55.639]  I've got as much fascination with capital as I do with gasoline going in my car.
[01:55:56.599 --> 01:55:57.580]  But I nonetheless need it.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:04.023]  And then of course there's a great sponsor, ResearchHerbs.com, and one of their wonderful products, LIV52 is the world's best-selling liver formula.
[01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:05.184]  Period.
[01:56:05.844 --> 01:56:15.910]  LIV52 neutralizes all kinds of toxins and poisons from the food you eat, the water you drink, the air you breathe, even prescription medications, which are all sources of detrimental effects on the liver.
[01:56:16.391 --> 01:56:18.672]  Improves the functional efficiency of the liver.
[01:56:19.052 --> 01:56:22.554]  LIV52 is a unique, all-natural, complex, multi-ingredient formula.
[01:56:23.214 --> 01:56:23.975]  Safe and effective.
[01:56:24.768 --> 01:56:29.370]  And it is a registered herbal drug in over 45 countries.
[01:56:29.711 --> 01:56:31.612]  Endorsed by over 200,000 healthcare professionals.
[01:56:31.632 --> 01:56:41.316]  You can learn all about it at www.researchherbs.com or 1-800-845-3841 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:56:41.336 --> 01:56:46.119]  But not just Live52, that's a liver detox, great formula, but everything else.
[01:56:46.139 --> 01:56:52.522]  I mean, these are the mainline stuff that people know, have been proven over the centuries to have really good effects and really good nutritive effects.
[01:56:53.528 --> 01:56:55.971]  It's all there, researchedherbs.com.
[01:56:57.872 --> 01:57:05.779]  And again, when we start the third hour here in a moment, we will start going to your calls quickly and moving on to the next person to give you a chance to get involved on air.
[01:57:05.839 --> 01:57:07.441]  Ron Paul will be on with us now Thursday.
[01:57:07.461 --> 01:57:09.923]  Forgot to mention that Friday that was rescheduled.
[01:57:11.496 --> 01:57:13.298]  We've got just so much in the next hour.
[01:57:13.378 --> 01:57:14.218]  Wait till I get to it.
[01:57:14.398 --> 01:57:15.499]  Open, shut down the web.
[01:57:15.519 --> 01:57:16.540]  New York Times reporting.
[01:57:17.641 --> 01:57:19.942]  Open bans on more than one child.
[01:57:20.102 --> 01:57:21.383]  Open bans on eating meat.
[01:57:22.044 --> 01:57:23.825]  All under the new carbon tax.
[01:57:23.845 --> 01:57:24.925]  It's just total tyranny.
[01:57:25.466 --> 01:57:26.527]  Wall-to-wall news.
[01:57:26.687 --> 01:57:27.367]  Just stay with us.
[01:57:27.407 --> 01:57:28.228]  PrisonPlanet.com
[01:57:49.702 --> 01:57:50.343]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.003 --> 01:57:52.084]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.784 --> 01:57:53.925]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.545 --> 01:57:55.366]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.106 --> 01:57:57.007]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.667 --> 01:58:01.329]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:05.952]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:25.892 --> 01:58:29.475]  Alright, we are now back, ladies and gentlemen, into the third hour.
[01:58:29.495 --> 01:58:38.563]  And we're going to be taking your calls and getting into a ton of news and playing a clip of Luke Radowsky and others confronting Giuliani in New York today.
[01:58:38.664 --> 01:58:45.470]  And we were going to get the video, because InfoWars reporters got it, but other people shot the incident happening, and local ABC
[01:58:47.239 --> 01:58:48.340]  And NBC, I'm now told.
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.441]  Covered it now, it's in the drug report everywhere else.
[01:58:50.722 --> 01:58:52.823]  Big articles going up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:52.843 --> 01:58:53.784]  Get it to the four wins.
[01:58:55.745 --> 01:58:59.207]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Dustra, I believe is how you pronounce it in Missouri.
[01:58:59.247 --> 01:58:59.968]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:58:59.988 --> 01:59:01.009]  Hi, it's Dustry.
[01:59:01.549 --> 01:59:02.430]  Oh, Dustry, okay.
[01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:03.350]  How you doing?
[01:59:03.630 --> 01:59:04.131]  Good.
[01:59:04.391 --> 01:59:05.191]  God bless Ron Paul.
[01:59:05.932 --> 01:59:06.192]  Yes.
[01:59:06.793 --> 01:59:09.434]  A little bit of information here.
[01:59:09.454 --> 01:59:11.536]  You may have already got wind of this.
[01:59:11.696 --> 01:59:14.698]  I had a gal from Aflac, an insurance company,
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:36.949]  Um, come in and visit me, and we got into a discussion on 9-1-1, this might be a little bit off topic, but she had just started working for Aflac, and she, one of the reasons she went to work for Aflac, I guess the Human Resources gal that interviewed her or whatever, had bragged about how Aflac had paid every first and last claim of any 9-11 victim.
[01:59:37.869 --> 01:59:38.229]  Okay?
[01:59:39.630 --> 01:59:44.732]  If you look in Aflac's, um, law, of what is not covered,
[01:59:45.239 --> 01:59:55.845]  They do not cover, and it's stated right there in their contract, any, it says, being exposed to war or any act of war declared or undeclared.
[01:59:55.865 --> 01:59:57.086]  They will not cover.
[01:59:57.106 --> 02:00:03.269]  So, AFLAC is considering 9-11 victims not an act of war.
[02:00:03.289 --> 02:00:05.030]  Does that make any sense to you?
[02:00:05.934 --> 02:00:06.334]  Oh, yeah.
[02:00:06.374 --> 02:00:10.517]  In fact, most insurance policies say acts of terror, war, or natural disaster.
[02:00:11.157 --> 02:00:14.519]  Or they'll say, oh, we cover water damage for your hurricane.
[02:00:14.539 --> 02:00:15.679]  You know, they'll trick you.
[02:00:15.719 --> 02:00:19.881]  They'll say, would you like hurricane water damage?
[02:00:19.901 --> 02:00:21.302]  You go, oh, hurricane water damage.
[02:00:21.782 --> 02:00:23.103]  It's called hurricane water damage.
[02:00:23.143 --> 02:00:23.904]  There's only water.
[02:00:24.424 --> 02:00:26.125]  Well, something like 95% of the damage is wind.
[02:00:30.405 --> 02:00:40.532]  See, I mean, the really destructive stuff, I mean, stuff will get flooded, but stuff that knocks houses over, or knocks things into houses, the really bad damage is the wind, so they don't cover that, but they trick you.
[02:00:40.892 --> 02:00:41.953]  It's all about tricks.
[02:00:42.033 --> 02:00:43.754]  Everything's about scams and lies.
[02:00:44.154 --> 02:00:50.579]  Weird about it is they act like they will not cover acts of war, but they covered every single last claim.
[02:00:51.474 --> 02:00:52.414]  Of a 9-11 victim.
[02:00:52.614 --> 02:00:57.116]  Well, that's because politically that would have been way too unpopular.
[02:00:57.156 --> 02:01:03.318]  Plus, the federal government ended up bailing out a lot of insurance companies, having supplemental funds, a lot of chicanery going on.
[02:01:03.698 --> 02:01:03.878]  Sure.
[02:01:03.958 --> 02:01:05.198]  I just thought that was kind of odd.
[02:01:05.258 --> 02:01:06.219]  By the way, I don't believe that.
[02:01:06.239 --> 02:01:08.139]  I don't believe they paid out everybody to put a claim in.
[02:01:08.739 --> 02:01:09.220]  Check into it.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:14.621]  The gal I talked to said she's got that from a pretty good source and she wouldn't reveal to me any names.
[02:01:14.641 --> 02:01:16.342]  Well, because the insurance company says so?
[02:01:16.362 --> 02:01:17.602]  I'm sorry?
[02:01:17.622 --> 02:01:19.263]  Because the insurance company says so?
[02:01:19.623 --> 02:01:19.763]  Right.
[02:01:20.566 --> 02:01:21.026]  Well, I know.
[02:01:21.046 --> 02:01:21.927]  I understand what you're saying.
[02:01:22.087 --> 02:01:22.507]  I mean, no!
[02:01:22.587 --> 02:01:29.309]  I mean, I've talked to a lot of 9-11 victims and their families who ended up being told, sign this contract waiving all your rights or you get nothing.
[02:01:29.649 --> 02:01:30.830]  And some of them have gotten nothing.
[02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.890]  Well, exactly.
[02:01:31.910 --> 02:01:32.690]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.451]  Oh, okay.
[02:01:33.511 --> 02:01:34.191]  I understand.
[02:01:34.731 --> 02:01:35.571]  Even with Aflac.
[02:01:35.651 --> 02:01:35.911]  Okay.
[02:01:36.372 --> 02:01:37.472]  Alright, I just thought it was kind of... No, no.
[02:01:37.492 --> 02:01:38.312]  I don't know about Aflac.
[02:01:38.332 --> 02:01:39.193]  You may be right, sir.
[02:01:39.213 --> 02:01:40.493]  There's an Aflac.
[02:01:40.513 --> 02:01:41.293]  They got the duck.
[02:01:41.333 --> 02:01:42.034]  That's their symbol.
[02:01:42.074 --> 02:01:44.855]  Yeah, Aflac is just a supplemental assurance.
[02:01:44.915 --> 02:01:46.035]  Not an insurance company.
[02:01:46.495 --> 02:01:48.736]  They're just a supplemental assurance company.
[02:01:49.269 --> 02:01:51.050]  Yeah, and they're the ones with the duck, that's correct.
[02:01:51.090 --> 02:01:51.870]  So check into it.
[02:01:51.890 --> 02:01:54.332]  Check with some of your resources and check it out.
[02:01:54.452 --> 02:01:56.113]  That untrustworthy quacker.
[02:01:56.133 --> 02:01:58.034]  Alright, off with being stupid.
[02:01:58.134 --> 02:01:58.614]  Thank you, sir.
[02:01:58.654 --> 02:01:59.494]  That is an interesting lead.
[02:01:59.514 --> 02:02:00.195]  We'll look into that.
[02:02:00.215 --> 02:02:07.378]  Alright, we're going to break and come back and go to Carlos and Robert and Tim and everybody else.
[02:02:07.719 --> 02:02:08.959]  Toll free number to join us.
[02:02:09.139 --> 02:02:10.220]  Actually, good idea to give the number out.
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:10.300]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:15.837 --> 02:02:22.003]  I get excited when the news of David Rockefeller being confronted face-to-face about 9-11 and the New World Order.
[02:02:22.943 --> 02:02:25.385]  I get really excited about it happening to Giuliani.
[02:02:25.526 --> 02:02:29.689]  I get really excited about it happening to Al Gore and Mr. Edwards.
[02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:34.273]  And it happening inside the Council on Foreign Relations.
[02:02:36.415 --> 02:02:38.037]  I mean, that's my drug.
[02:02:38.917 --> 02:02:40.759]  It's beating these people and I'm high as a kite.
[02:02:48.479 --> 02:02:53.949]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.310 --> 02:03:01.883]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.631 --> 02:03:09.695]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.095 --> 02:03:21.541]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.821 --> 02:03:25.523]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.764 --> 02:03:27.705]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.045 --> 02:03:31.907]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:03:32.487 --> 02:03:39.960]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:03:45.526 --> 02:03:49.089]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:03:49.129 --> 02:03:49.629]  are located?
[02:03:49.849 --> 02:03:53.231]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:03:53.451 --> 02:03:58.155]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:03:58.435 --> 02:04:03.438]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:04:03.738 --> 02:04:04.059]  I think so.
[02:04:22.281 --> 02:04:22.641]  I think so.
[02:04:45.006 --> 02:04:47.949]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:04:48.129 --> 02:04:53.334]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:04:53.634 --> 02:04:58.899]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:59.339 --> 02:05:00.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:09.888]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:05:10.148 --> 02:05:20.838]  Now compare Calben Pure So, all natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[02:05:46.562 --> 02:05:52.586]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.186 --> 02:05:56.228]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.768 --> 02:06:01.871]  All right, we're going to your calls in just a moment, then I'll tell you about the big breaking news.
[02:06:05.714 --> 02:06:12.298]  In New York, with the Infowars team, led by Luke Rudowski confronting Rudolph Giuliani.
[02:06:12.338 --> 02:06:16.040]  This is just fabulous, fabulous news.
[02:06:17.389 --> 02:06:18.569]  And that is coming up.
[02:06:19.650 --> 02:06:26.232]  Before I go any further, my friends, the FDA and Big Pharma are conspiring to deprive you of nutrition.
[02:06:26.272 --> 02:06:27.012]  Everybody knows that.
[02:06:28.593 --> 02:06:31.154]  Energy and good health, you are entitled to.
[02:06:32.274 --> 02:06:34.795]  Are they concerned about the stress and anxiety levels in your life?
[02:06:35.475 --> 02:06:40.217]  You bet they are, because the more you have, the sicker you will be, and the more drugs they can sell you.
[02:06:41.517 --> 02:06:46.959]  You can change this, improve your nutrition with InnerFood, the best all-natural organic supplier.
[02:06:47.679 --> 02:06:47.919]  I think so.
[02:07:18.410 --> 02:07:23.933]  We're just looking around for my New York News articles with Giuliani being confronted.
[02:07:23.973 --> 02:07:24.374]  Here it is.
[02:07:25.254 --> 02:07:26.115]  WNBC.
[02:07:26.695 --> 02:07:28.856]  Giuliani confronted New York Fundraiser.
[02:07:29.296 --> 02:07:32.558]  A radical group and a Bronx fundraiser confronted Rudolph Giuliani.
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:38.482]  That's the team and they had Infowars.com press passes.
[02:07:38.682 --> 02:07:40.463]  Why didn't they say that?
[02:07:41.272 --> 02:07:46.919]  Because NBC doesn't want people to learn the name of the media outlets so they can't find out.
[02:07:47.399 --> 02:07:57.231]  It's up to you to go get the story that we have on PrisonPlanet.com right now so that people can learn more about Infowars.com and the auxiliary organization WeAreChanged.org.
[02:07:59.213 --> 02:08:01.396]  Don't let them get away with this and just spin it their way.
[02:08:02.466 --> 02:08:07.950]  And so Giuliani was extremely polite, telling the young woman that she was wrong, that he never said what she claimed.
[02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:17.418]  You're going to get caught with this, Giuliani, because you're on record two weeks ago saying that you were told Tower 1 and 2 were going to come down, and on 9-11 to Peter Jennings.
[02:08:18.179 --> 02:08:20.540]  Oh, we've got you, and it's up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:08:20.801 --> 02:08:22.042]  Expose that liar!
[02:08:22.062 --> 02:08:23.022]  Okay, I'll set it to you in a minute.
[02:08:24.043 --> 02:08:26.365]  Robert in New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:08:28.287 --> 02:08:29.107]  Hello, can you hear me?
[02:08:29.487 --> 02:08:29.888]  Yes, sir.
[02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:45.696]  I just wanted to let you and your listeners know, definitely, I've just been noticing a huge effect lately around here, just talking to security guards, people on the street, everyone is just talking about like
[02:08:46.286 --> 02:08:48.828]  Just 9-11, it's just, it's in the public dialogue now.
[02:08:48.868 --> 02:08:49.868]  I just really noticed that.
[02:08:49.888 --> 02:08:52.550]  I just wanted to mention that and just let you know you're having such a great effect.
[02:08:52.730 --> 02:08:53.791]  Well, it's all of us together.
[02:08:53.891 --> 02:08:55.172]  I do not take credit for it.
[02:08:55.592 --> 02:08:57.673]  I am literally a very small part of this.
[02:08:58.013 --> 02:09:02.396]  Out of all the millions of units that make up 9-11 Truth, I'm a very small piece.
[02:09:02.456 --> 02:09:07.539]  Now, I am the biggest piece, but it's kind of like at the seashore and there's all this sand and shells.
[02:09:07.839 --> 02:09:11.982]  I'm like a big, big conch shell that washed up, but I am definitely not the seashore.
[02:09:13.120 --> 02:09:13.781]  Great, great.
[02:09:13.801 --> 02:09:14.341]  I understand.
[02:09:14.621 --> 02:09:15.322]  And just one more thing.
[02:09:15.382 --> 02:09:25.250]  One of my jobs has been to work at these business conferences, and I just did the... It's called the Homeland Security Technology Conference at the New York Palace Hotel, and I was just... I had to call in.
[02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:26.711]  I was absolutely outraged.
[02:09:26.771 --> 02:09:29.994]  These companies, they just... They're not American companies.
[02:09:30.094 --> 02:09:36.899]  I mean, LaserCard Corporation bragging about how they have the RFIDs already for the new Z visas, and they have the contract.
[02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:41.183]  ID Solutions, another company, just bragging about how they have a...
[02:09:41.821 --> 02:09:44.883]  New device that can read someone's retina from 30 feet away.
[02:09:45.023 --> 02:09:47.224]  I was just absolutely outraged.
[02:09:47.284 --> 02:09:59.651]  I had to call in and just let you know these companies... Oh yeah, when I was at UT, let me just tell you, three years ago, that's what most of the research was, was about long-distance passive eye scanners, but go ahead.
[02:10:00.912 --> 02:10:08.897]  Oh yeah, no, I just, anyone who thinks that, I mean, these businesses are for preserving Americans' rights or anything like that, they are not.
[02:10:09.997 --> 02:10:10.478]  I just wanted to...
[02:10:17.703 --> 02:10:21.046]  Scholarships are for tattling, spying, going through records.
[02:10:21.446 --> 02:10:25.729]  A&M, Austin, both of them here are like literally run by the CIA publicly now.
[02:10:25.769 --> 02:10:28.891]  They have generals and admirals and former NSA heads running it.
[02:10:29.392 --> 02:10:32.094]  They're just sucking all the money out, not even spending it on students.
[02:10:32.514 --> 02:10:34.776]  And then there's things like ITT Technical.
[02:10:35.156 --> 02:10:40.059]  You don't go there to learn, you know, soldering or computers or programming or data management.
[02:10:40.099 --> 02:10:42.741]  You learn how to be a security guard or a cop.
[02:10:43.102 --> 02:10:44.643]  Look man, that's all it's going to be.
[02:10:45.223 --> 02:10:49.429]  It's just people in black uniforms with television worshipping them and them feeding on us.
[02:11:01.741 --> 02:11:21.231]  Just so excited about all the new, I mean, stuff they have going on, and the investment bankers just eating it all up, and they'll all preface it always with, because of the War on Terror, Osama Bin Laden, and everyone will just kind of, you know, just sort of chuckle a little bit, and then we'll go right into their business solutions and their surveillance.
[02:11:21.311 --> 02:11:26.073]  That's right, I've been at some of these similar things, and they revel in the evil.
[02:11:26.373 --> 02:11:27.354]  Oh, it's for your freedom!
[02:11:27.374 --> 02:11:29.595]  Oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:31.810]  Hello?
[02:11:32.190 --> 02:11:33.511]  Yeah, no, I said, go ahead, tell us more about it.
[02:11:34.271 --> 02:11:37.252]  Oh, uh, well, I don't know how much more I can say about it.
[02:11:37.292 --> 02:11:49.477]  I mean, they're just, you know, so excited about the new technology, incorporating DNA and RFID into all the, uh, the new cards they're gonna give everyone, and everyone's gonna get them, and just all the stuff that you're saying is absolutely true, and, uh, yeah, I just definitely wanted to let you know that, let you know that.
[02:11:50.657 --> 02:11:52.098]  You're probably making it up.
[02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:54.499]  The government's good.
[02:11:54.519 --> 02:11:55.379]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:11:56.439 --> 02:12:00.721]  Well, you know, in England, they, uh, this came out a few months ago,
[02:12:01.644 --> 02:12:10.929]  They'll just announce, it's time to come take your fingerprints, it's time to take a prick of blood, it's time to do this, oh it's a game, we're going to play secret agent.
[02:12:11.410 --> 02:12:13.711]  Nationwide they did it, it was illegal, not even a law.
[02:12:14.791 --> 02:12:22.516]  And in just a few months, they put a large percentage of the children in the country, because kids like to play games, it was all even, and they even had psychiatrists
[02:12:23.169 --> 02:12:23.869]  We're good to go.
[02:12:46.306 --> 02:12:55.872]  We've got the national ID card they're pushing to stop the illegals, which is really the North American ID, in the official documents, while they deny all that on the national news.
[02:12:55.992 --> 02:13:02.196]  I mean, it is just... But in England now, and they're trying this in the U.S., if they stop you, they take DNA.
[02:13:02.216 --> 02:13:04.158]  They stop you for speeding, they take DNA.
[02:13:04.938 --> 02:13:06.299]  And I keep telling everybody this.
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:15.185]  If you're under 34 years of age, at birth, if you were born in a hospital, your blood is in a government data bank.
[02:13:16.235 --> 02:13:16.736]  Period.
[02:13:17.316 --> 02:13:21.299]  If you were born in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, or the United States.
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:25.563]  Now, I've had congressmen on, I've read documents, it's been in the news a few times.
[02:13:26.204 --> 02:13:29.667]  Folks, they've been taking your blood illegally since 1973.
[02:13:32.253 --> 02:13:34.034]  Okay, I mean that's how far gone.
[02:13:34.394 --> 02:13:36.235]  It has nothing to do with Bush and Clinton.
[02:13:36.275 --> 02:13:36.995]  They're puppets.
[02:13:37.516 --> 02:13:41.478]  There is a brainiac technocracy that is in control.
[02:13:41.838 --> 02:13:44.819]  They do whatever the hell they want, and they are totally wicked.
[02:13:45.060 --> 02:13:46.580]  Well, I appreciate you calling in, Robert.
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.081]  Anything else?
[02:13:47.481 --> 02:13:49.362]  Could I just quickly just plug something I'm doing?
[02:13:49.502 --> 02:13:49.962]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:13:50.422 --> 02:13:56.865]  Oh, I've just been inspired by you and Moose Change and all these people to just write my own one-act play and finance it myself here in New York City.
[02:13:57.426 --> 02:14:01.828]  And information's available at questionsandwhat.com for that play.
[02:14:02.387 --> 02:14:05.328]  Well, thanks for calling up and running a gauntlet with me talking over you.
[02:14:05.348 --> 02:14:05.949]  That's exciting.
[02:14:06.329 --> 02:14:07.609]  Questions and what?
[02:14:08.230 --> 02:14:11.331]  Yeah, questionsandwhat.com.
[02:14:11.651 --> 02:14:12.411]  Fantastic.
[02:14:12.491 --> 02:14:13.712]  I'll check it out, my friend.
[02:14:13.752 --> 02:14:14.092]  Keep it up.
[02:14:14.112 --> 02:14:21.235]  And listen, if you want to write us a blurb, an article, about what you saw at that technology conference, you can use the name Mark Twain, if you wish, or use your real name.
[02:14:21.755 --> 02:14:23.136]  And I'd love to do that, Robert.
[02:14:24.136 --> 02:14:26.957]  Because there's a lot people can... In fact, listeners, we've got a lot of smart listeners.
[02:14:27.358 --> 02:14:30.559]  We've got people more eloquent, more genteel, more focused, more educated than I.
[02:14:31.523 --> 02:14:33.064]  Why don't you write articles for us, Robert?
[02:14:33.544 --> 02:14:36.867]  Others, you go to these things, you see these things, you know, you're probably, what, some writer.
[02:14:37.147 --> 02:14:38.668]  Sounds like you write for magazines or something.
[02:14:39.088 --> 02:14:41.310]  And so you went to cover this, you had to sit there and hear all this bull.
[02:14:42.731 --> 02:14:46.913]  And you're worried that if you put out a news article bashing all this, that they won't give you as many jobs.
[02:14:46.933 --> 02:14:47.754]  I've talked to a lot of reporters.
[02:14:47.774 --> 02:14:48.655]  Just use a fake name.
[02:14:49.355 --> 02:14:50.036]  Call it a pen name.
[02:14:50.056 --> 02:14:50.676]  I know you know that.
[02:14:50.696 --> 02:14:57.761]  But for the listeners that don't, I mean, I've thought about writing stuff so radical that I can't even say it myself, but now I just do it, so I don't need to.
[02:14:58.281 --> 02:15:01.103]  You know, and using some type of a pen name.
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:10.345]  I thought about using the pen name Spartacus, but then I realized that the Illuminati used that name.
[02:15:11.586 --> 02:15:14.569]  Literally, I was watching Spartacus on TV like 10, 12 years ago.
[02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:16.611]  I remember going, that would be a cool pen name, Spartacus.
[02:15:17.371 --> 02:15:20.935]  And a few years later I was reading about Adam Weishaupt, the Illuminati, and that was his code name.
[02:15:20.975 --> 02:15:24.678]  I thought, that may not be the best name for me to use as a pen name.
[02:15:25.498 --> 02:15:27.099]  But hey, no need to use a pen name.
[02:15:27.119 --> 02:15:28.300]  My name's Alex Jones.
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:31.862]  I've had a lot of old friends go, hey, I'm booking a flight for you.
[02:15:31.882 --> 02:15:33.223]  Your name's really Alex Jones, right?
[02:15:33.684 --> 02:15:35.145]  Yeah, it's Alex Jones.
[02:15:36.646 --> 02:15:41.689]  My wife does have a pen name because early on she used to get threats and stuff and she was just my girlfriend.
[02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:47.193]  Some locals discovered it and thought that they had found the grail, the grail of wickedness.
[02:15:50.066 --> 02:15:53.388]  But then selectively didn't care if other locals had pen names, which is just very weird.
[02:15:54.168 --> 02:15:56.369]  Ah, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:15:58.430 --> 02:16:00.492]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:16:00.532 --> 02:16:01.292]  Tim, you're on the air.
[02:16:01.312 --> 02:16:01.692]  Go ahead.
[02:16:02.012 --> 02:16:02.873]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:16:02.893 --> 02:16:10.497]  I had to tell you how much fun I had yesterday at my local Memorial Day parade, walking around in my Ron Paul for President t-shirt.
[02:16:11.077 --> 02:16:16.060]  I went and I parked myself right at the end of the parade, and starting with the VFW Honor Guard,
[02:16:16.559 --> 02:16:33.303]  And every unit after that, that was carrying a gold fringe flag, I handed out cards with the title 4 USC 3, provides that anything put on the title 4 USC 1-2 American flag, such as gold fringe, mutilates that flag and carries a one year prison term.
[02:16:34.123 --> 02:16:40.424]  And of course, all the other corresponding numbers, and you know, you could look that up in the Black's Law Dictionary, if you don't believe it, and then write down a line.
[02:16:40.444 --> 02:16:43.665]  People don't know, flags are flags for a reason.
[02:16:44.814 --> 02:16:47.496]  It comes out of heraldry, but on ships and in communication.
[02:16:48.076 --> 02:16:49.577]  Flags are a communication.
[02:16:50.037 --> 02:16:59.042]  And when the federal and state government does different things with flags, that means a law has been enacted by Admiralty Fiat when they have a gold French flag.
[02:16:59.342 --> 02:17:00.383]  People laugh at us for that.
[02:17:00.443 --> 02:17:01.063]  No, it's a fact.
[02:17:01.758 --> 02:17:03.920]  Gold fringe means America is conquered.
[02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:04.941]  Militarily.
[02:17:05.021 --> 02:17:16.189]  And that's why mayors call us civilians, governors call us civilians, and themselves authorities, officials under admiralty governorship of the Bank of England.
[02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:18.411]  And it's an absolute fact, but of course they don't care.
[02:17:18.851 --> 02:17:26.377]  Every single unit I hit, the Hitler Youth, the Sheriff's Department, the Fire Department, and the best... Well, tell us about the Hitler Youth.
[02:17:26.617 --> 02:17:29.880]  They've always got the Secure Corps sub-designates there.
[02:17:30.658 --> 02:17:34.400]  No, they're training them with machine guns, of course, but your children aren't supposed to have guns.
[02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:39.543]  Yeah, we're going to have to face them.
[02:17:39.563 --> 02:17:40.303]  You know it's coming.
[02:17:40.323 --> 02:17:41.084]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:41.104 --> 02:17:41.464]  Stay with me.
[02:17:47.122 --> 02:17:48.163]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:17:48.483 --> 02:17:51.284]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:51.544 --> 02:17:55.687]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:56.127 --> 02:17:56.947]  So what do you do?
[02:17:57.267 --> 02:18:01.830]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:02.330 --> 02:18:04.452]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:18:04.932 --> 02:18:19.645]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:18:47.003 --> 02:18:48.044]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.444 --> 02:18:53.928]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:54.508 --> 02:18:55.008]  That's right.
[02:18:55.308 --> 02:18:57.610]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:57.930 --> 02:19:05.095]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:05.635 --> 02:19:13.343]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:13.783 --> 02:19:18.588]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.250 --> 02:19:24.274]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:20:46.628 --> 02:20:49.009]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:20:49.129 --> 02:20:52.111]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.

[02:21:07.060 --> 02:21:07.640]  We're good to go!
[02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:35.531]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[02:21:35.551 --> 02:21:39.092]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:22:00.194 --> 02:22:02.135]  By the way, I have no idea what that music is.
[02:22:02.175 --> 02:22:06.196]  I'm not attacking it, but it somehow got in my playlist, and I disavow it.
[02:22:06.216 --> 02:22:07.957]  Some kind of commie music.
[02:22:07.977 --> 02:22:10.098]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:22:10.118 --> 02:22:11.058]  I need to be serious here.
[02:22:11.078 --> 02:22:11.798]  Too much is going on.
[02:22:11.818 --> 02:22:17.381]  I just get so excited hearing Rockefeller, Al Gore, John Edwards, Giuliani.
[02:22:17.581 --> 02:22:18.641]  Oh!
[02:22:18.721 --> 02:22:20.882]  CFR infiltrated Rockefeller's house.
[02:22:21.222 --> 02:22:21.362]  Oh!
[02:22:22.202 --> 02:22:26.344]  I mean, literally, folks, that is like Christmas and New Year's and
[02:22:27.532 --> 02:22:29.333]  The county fair all came at once.
[02:22:29.574 --> 02:22:34.217]  I mean, I am just... I'm having endorphin rushes right now.
[02:22:34.237 --> 02:22:35.538]  I mean, this is what I'm into.
[02:22:35.598 --> 02:22:40.122]  I'm into taking it to the New World Order, having... And I get even more excited about other people doing it.
[02:22:40.782 --> 02:22:43.144]  When I do it, it doesn't really get me excited.
[02:22:44.205 --> 02:22:47.587]  But just to see other people do it, I guess it's the only way I get to spectate.
[02:22:47.968 --> 02:22:53.092]  I'm not really a spectator in life, but I do get to spectate and see what others are doing in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:22:54.272 --> 02:23:01.136]  That's the type of season tickets I want, let me just tell you, where it actually matters and isn't some transitory bull.
[02:23:01.637 --> 02:23:04.078]  You see those instincts you have for getting excited about sports?
[02:23:04.559 --> 02:23:09.762]  Those are misappropriated instincts that are for real warfare for your tribe, real defense of your people.
[02:23:10.042 --> 02:23:11.563]  That's why it feels good.
[02:23:11.823 --> 02:23:12.644]  But it's fake.
[02:23:12.724 --> 02:23:13.785]  It's a facsimile.
[02:23:14.105 --> 02:23:14.905]  It's a fraud.
[02:23:14.945 --> 02:23:17.207]  It is a shadow of the real thing.
[02:23:21.389 --> 02:23:23.771]  And again, men misappropriate their manliness today.
[02:23:25.398 --> 02:23:39.824]  You strut around with the roid muscles, bugging your eyes out with tattoos head to toe, and you watch Ultimate Fighting, and you ride them hardly, and you strut around, and you ask little clerks at stores, you got a problem punk?
[02:23:40.304 --> 02:23:41.945]  But a cop pulls you over, you grovel to him.
[02:23:42.225 --> 02:23:43.105]  Because you're not a real man.
[02:23:44.766 --> 02:23:45.146]  You see?
[02:23:47.167 --> 02:23:51.169]  It's an image, a facsimile, and I'm not knocking you if you've got big muscles and tattoos.
[02:23:51.209 --> 02:23:52.689]  My point is, you know the people I'm talking about.
[02:23:53.209 --> 02:23:54.550]  They're into being manly.
[02:23:55.220 --> 02:23:56.401]  Me, I'm not into being manly.
[02:23:56.561 --> 02:23:59.062]  I am into being nurturative and good and loving.
[02:24:02.463 --> 02:24:10.306]  And just a little secret to men out there, if you actually get into that area of your brain, if you actually get in contact with that, that's where the real strength lies.
[02:24:11.673 --> 02:24:13.394]  And I just want you to know that.
[02:24:13.815 --> 02:24:25.122]  I can't imagine what some of these men I see out here who aren't real men, who they would be if they had real fathers, who they would have been if their fathers had real fathers, if they hadn't been cowardly scum.
[02:24:25.502 --> 02:24:27.604]  See, cowardly scum tries to act like a man.
[02:24:28.539 --> 02:24:41.629]  Instead of being a man, and I want to tell all the despicable men of this country, you jellyfish, that you've let this country go to hell in a handbasket, and you've turned your face away from the face and the memory of your fathers, and you are a disgrace.
[02:24:42.209 --> 02:24:44.050]  You should stop being a disgrace.
[02:24:45.712 --> 02:24:47.313]  You let your families fall apart.
[02:24:48.073 --> 02:24:49.675]  You let your women rule over you.
[02:24:50.555 --> 02:24:51.396]  You're pathetic!
[02:24:55.017 --> 02:24:56.277]  Let's go back to Tim in Ohio.
[02:24:56.317 --> 02:24:58.978]  So they had a bunch of Hitler youth out there, huh?
[02:24:59.018 --> 02:25:01.979]  The veterans parade, desecrating the memory of our veterans.
[02:25:02.539 --> 02:25:03.619]  And the flag.
[02:25:03.999 --> 02:25:08.500]  They all seemed like surprised when I showed them the information.
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:10.701]  But the best one, you know, and I was hitting everybody.
[02:25:10.721 --> 02:25:14.982]  I was hitting the Sheriff's Department, the Police Department, the Fire Department, anyone that was carrying that gold fringe flag.
[02:25:15.202 --> 02:25:20.043]  Not only did they get that card with that information on it, they got handed an Aaron Russo, freedom to fascism.
[02:25:20.503 --> 02:25:24.504]  But the best one was a sergeant from the Young Marines.
[02:25:25.294 --> 02:25:30.458]  And I approached him very calmly, and I said, excuse me, sir, but with all due respect, would you please read this paragraph?
[02:25:31.039 --> 02:25:33.560]  And at the end, I could see in his face that it was breaking.
[02:25:33.580 --> 02:25:41.366]  And then in front of all his young Marines, I asked him, point blank, I mean, right in his face, I thought the Marines' job was to defend the Constitution.
[02:25:41.667 --> 02:25:43.648]  And he, his whole body just crimped.
[02:25:43.708 --> 02:25:46.430]  It looked like he made a big Queen Elizabeth right in his shorts.
[02:25:48.272 --> 02:25:48.672]  Really?
[02:25:49.292 --> 02:25:50.073]  It was delicious.
[02:25:50.393 --> 02:25:53.155]  Well, that's because, I mean, that's because a Marine officer knows what U.S.
[02:25:53.195 --> 02:25:53.716]  Code is.
[02:25:54.770 --> 02:25:56.732]  I mean, you tell the average publican what a U.S.
[02:25:56.773 --> 02:25:58.975]  code is, they don't know what you're talking about.
[02:25:59.135 --> 02:25:59.796]  They just laugh.
[02:25:59.836 --> 02:26:00.577]  They're in precondition.
[02:26:00.817 --> 02:26:02.239]  Oh, he's telling me about laws!
[02:26:02.459 --> 02:26:03.380]  Ha ha!
[02:26:03.601 --> 02:26:05.062]  He's trying to tell cops about laws!
[02:26:05.283 --> 02:26:06.204]  Ha ha!
[02:26:06.724 --> 02:26:13.693]  And did you see, over the weekend, CNN had a medical report of a big Palm Beach County sheriff getting microchipped right on TV.
[02:26:14.434 --> 02:26:16.696]  For his medical records, so he'll be safe.
[02:26:17.136 --> 02:26:18.097]  Oh, that's so sick.
[02:26:18.617 --> 02:26:21.019]  How can you not see through it, police and military?
[02:26:21.099 --> 02:26:22.020]  Good Lord!
[02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:25.302]  I mean, how much sicker does it have to get?
[02:26:25.322 --> 02:26:27.624]  Operation Vampire Killer.
[02:26:27.644 --> 02:26:28.525]  Just look it up.
[02:26:29.245 --> 02:26:30.266]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:26:30.306 --> 02:26:30.526]  Yeah.
[02:26:31.066 --> 02:26:31.747]  Jack McClam.
[02:26:33.168 --> 02:26:34.009]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:26:35.270 --> 02:26:36.170]  Shannon, one more.
[02:26:38.512 --> 02:26:39.253]  Who's up next here?
[02:26:40.493 --> 02:26:41.334]  Tylen, Ohio.
[02:26:41.374 --> 02:26:42.235]  Or I-O, excuse me.
[02:26:43.115 --> 02:26:43.696]  Hello, sir.
[02:26:44.369 --> 02:26:48.672]  Hi Alex, I just want to thank you for taking my call and thank you for waking me up.
[02:26:48.792 --> 02:26:51.494]  I was an ex-Neocon follower, if you will.
[02:26:52.335 --> 02:27:04.083]  My question for you is this, and I got my own take on it, but I wanted your take, is how do you think the New World Order is going to rectify a cashless society and the drug war?
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:06.881]  When we get back, let me explain that.
[02:27:06.921 --> 02:27:07.241]  Stay there.
[02:27:07.261 --> 02:27:18.450]  And then I'm going to play the clip off WNBC, Giuliani Confronted in New York Fundraiser by Infowars.com, Frontline Info Commandos.
[02:27:19.431 --> 02:27:21.033]  And then we'll get into all the other news.
[02:27:21.113 --> 02:27:31.341]  Stay with me, everybody, as I try to catch my breath and as I try to control myself this break and not do celebrations all over the office.
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:38.741]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.662 --> 02:27:42.423]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.404 --> 02:27:50.366]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:27:50.686 --> 02:27:52.567]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:27:52.767 --> 02:27:55.809]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:27:55.989 --> 02:27:59.130]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:27:59.430 --> 02:28:01.271]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:28:01.551 --> 02:28:05.252]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:28:05.532 --> 02:28:08.193]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[02:28:08.813 --> 02:28:13.075]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:28:13.295 --> 02:28:17.556]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:28:17.996 --> 02:28:22.338]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:28:22.638 --> 02:28:26.880]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:28:27.220 --> 02:28:33.103]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:28:33.403 --> 02:28:35.824]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:28:36.024 --> 02:28:36.845]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:28:36.865 --> 02:28:38.225]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:28:45.928 --> 02:28:47.629]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:28:47.789 --> 02:28:49.049]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:28:49.289 --> 02:28:52.110]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:28:52.470 --> 02:28:55.251]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:28:55.771 --> 02:29:02.513]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:29:03.073 --> 02:29:10.776]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.

[02:29:15.521 --> 02:29:17.684]  It's time to stand up for what you believe.
[02:29:18.025 --> 02:29:19.086]  Invest in your freedom.

[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:32.241]  That's 877-873-9626 and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:29:32.261 --> 02:29:32.661]  Call 877-873-9626.
[02:29:32.701 --> 02:29:32.881]  That's 877-873-9626.
[02:29:45.166 --> 02:29:47.007]  Summer is once again just around the corner.
[02:29:47.407 --> 02:29:49.668]  And as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:29:50.109 --> 02:29:53.290]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[02:29:53.731 --> 02:30:01.455]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:30:02.735 --> 02:30:09.321]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[02:30:09.761 --> 02:30:13.524]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:30:13.965 --> 02:30:18.809]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:30:19.229 --> 02:30:25.775]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:30:26.435 --> 02:30:28.117]  And it's so easy to use.
[02:30:28.477 --> 02:30:34.442]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill up and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[02:30:34.863 --> 02:30:41.248]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.
[02:30:41.528 --> 02:30:43.630]  That's ctsavegas.com.
[02:31:00.601 --> 02:31:10.046]  The only way the enemy can win is if they are able to remain hidden from us.
[02:31:11.787 --> 02:31:25.095]  It is our task to tear away the veils and to reveal the enemy in all their towers, in all their fortresses, in all their high places.
[02:31:26.977 --> 02:31:39.287]  We are an unstoppable force with God's aid if we only illuminate our enemies so that they can be brought down.
[02:31:41.609 --> 02:31:55.921]  Alright, to answer the question of a caller from Iowa, they're going to give you a cashless society the same way they're going to give you a national ID card.
[02:31:56.593 --> 02:32:06.664]  Which is really a unit in the North American ID card that is a unit in the Pan-American ID system that is a unit in the agreed-upon international standards of what?
[02:32:06.844 --> 02:32:07.925]  Six and a half years ago.
[02:32:08.646 --> 02:32:13.911]  By the United Nations and international treaty agreements and conventions as they're called.
[02:32:15.553 --> 02:32:17.235]  They call the larger treaties conventions.
[02:32:17.275 --> 02:32:19.357]  Everybody comes and signs on to the convention.
[02:32:20.160 --> 02:32:22.121]  Generally a treaty would just be between two parties.
[02:32:22.422 --> 02:32:29.266]  The conventions are large, multi-signatory treaties of treason against this republic.
[02:32:31.888 --> 02:32:32.208]  Alright.
[02:32:35.690 --> 02:32:36.671]  So the illegal aliens
[02:32:40.766 --> 02:32:41.866]  ...are above the law.
[02:32:41.926 --> 02:32:43.447]  They don't have to get the national ID.
[02:32:43.487 --> 02:32:44.967]  They don't have to have it to get bank accounts.
[02:32:44.987 --> 02:32:45.887]  They're not going to have to.
[02:32:45.907 --> 02:32:48.128]  They just tell you it's for them, and then don't enforce it.
[02:32:48.328 --> 02:32:50.388]  They tell you they're going to build a fence, and they say, we're not going to do it.
[02:32:50.428 --> 02:32:51.268]  I've already funded it.
[02:32:51.288 --> 02:32:52.309]  And they use it for control.
[02:32:52.629 --> 02:32:54.049]  The money they grab for something else.
[02:32:54.529 --> 02:32:58.930]  They actually use part of that money for surveillance inside major cities, and for the war.
[02:32:59.410 --> 02:33:00.850]  It's just the crooks, folks.
[02:33:01.551 --> 02:33:02.831]  They're hardcore crooks.
[02:33:02.871 --> 02:33:03.631]  They're strip miners.
[02:33:04.996 --> 02:33:14.882]  I mean, there have been other evil elites, but a lot of them had big grand visions and ideas and generally were still tribal to the extent that they knew the power came from their tribe, and so they would try to build things up for their tribe.
[02:33:15.263 --> 02:33:20.506]  While getting a lot of their tribe killed, they still loved their sword, which was their people.
[02:33:21.577 --> 02:33:26.901]  Now, the New World Order take us like a sword and just literally beat it into pieces, crushing their enemies.
[02:33:27.241 --> 02:33:36.908]  And then they use the next country they grab up, the next sword, and then even if they were to beat their enemies without breaking it, they then break that sword and move on so no one can rise up behind them.
[02:33:40.290 --> 02:33:43.152]  I guess a good analogy in popular culture would be the Chronicles of Riddick.
[02:33:43.212 --> 02:33:47.255]  After they take over each planet, they, you know, destroy the surface of it and move on.
[02:33:49.031 --> 02:34:00.305]  That's a good way to describe the New World Order, while they run around saying, let us have world government to keep you safe for the environment, while they genetic engineer and cross-species the entire biosphere as if they're trying to kill the planet.
[02:34:00.726 --> 02:34:02.548]  These people are right out of the pits of hell.
[02:34:03.329 --> 02:34:04.911]  Literally, when I say that, I mean that.
[02:34:07.955 --> 02:34:11.738]  You know how industrial and how big a 700 billion dollar a year drug trade is?
[02:34:12.339 --> 02:34:16.623]  You know how big over a million women and children have been kidnapped a year by the governments of the world?
[02:34:16.643 --> 02:34:17.744]  You know how big that is?
[02:34:17.964 --> 02:34:21.307]  What it takes to cover that and screen that and it's admitted it's there?
[02:34:21.647 --> 02:34:22.908]  That's who we're talking about.
[02:34:23.489 --> 02:34:27.152]  They haven't done all that here yet en masse because they don't have our guns yet.
[02:34:27.472 --> 02:34:29.114]  The minute they do, they will.
[02:34:29.989 --> 02:34:30.829]  You fools!
[02:34:31.750 --> 02:34:33.550]  And I'm talking to the police out there right now.
[02:34:33.570 --> 02:34:36.451]  Why do you think you watch shows like Jack Bauer and you're told to watch it?
[02:34:36.491 --> 02:34:43.714]  Because on those shows your soul is literally twisted and taken from you and you're taught in situational ethics that torture is good.
[02:34:44.134 --> 02:34:46.075]  You're brought over to the dark side.
[02:34:46.315 --> 02:34:49.416]  Your baptism of wickedness is complete!
[02:34:52.532 --> 02:34:53.812]  You understand that?
[02:34:53.872 --> 02:34:55.893]  They traffic in your souls.
[02:34:56.393 --> 02:34:59.454]  They don't care about corvettes and castles.
[02:35:00.135 --> 02:35:04.096]  They don't even care about bimbos or jewelry.
[02:35:04.536 --> 02:35:06.017]  They care about ideas.
[02:35:06.077 --> 02:35:07.477]  They care about mindsets.
[02:35:07.737 --> 02:35:11.939]  They care about who you are and making sure you're not free.
[02:35:12.019 --> 02:35:14.840]  Because if you're free, you will resist them.
[02:35:15.080 --> 02:35:18.841]  You're either with them or you're with God, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:19.101 --> 02:35:19.761]  They know that.
[02:35:19.801 --> 02:35:21.942]  You're either with them or you're against them.
[02:35:22.717 --> 02:35:24.899]  You're either of the darkness or you're of the light.
[02:35:25.539 --> 02:35:26.920]  That's the way the universe works.
[02:35:27.361 --> 02:35:30.703]  You're either on either side of that dividing line.
[02:35:30.743 --> 02:35:32.805]  A very clear dividing line.
[02:35:35.908 --> 02:35:37.389]  The wicked are very unhappy.
[02:35:38.029 --> 02:35:39.070]  They are very bestial.
[02:35:39.090 --> 02:35:40.291]  They are very instinctive.
[02:35:40.872 --> 02:35:44.675]  All they have is the next animalistic satiation.
[02:35:46.616 --> 02:35:51.160]  And they always think it's got to be something greater, something worse to satiate them next.
[02:35:51.815 --> 02:36:01.700]  That's why their pleasure, their artwork, their hobby, when they get full control of a country, is killing tens of millions.
[02:36:04.722 --> 02:36:11.225]  It is the mass exercise of deviltry.
[02:36:14.156 --> 02:36:15.637]  My God, the news I have in front of me.
[02:36:15.897 --> 02:36:19.138]  They're now taking Falun Gong and injecting them with chemicals that paralyze them.
[02:36:19.658 --> 02:36:24.000]  And then as a soft kill weapon, they throw them back on the street to their family, who then take care of them.
[02:36:24.420 --> 02:36:26.621]  And they shrivel up over the next few years and die.
[02:36:26.641 --> 02:36:31.163]  And they're our big buddies over in China.
[02:36:32.324 --> 02:36:33.724]  They're the model for the world.
[02:36:33.744 --> 02:36:39.007]  24 mobile execution vans in each of China's 15 largest cities.
[02:36:39.407 --> 02:36:39.947]  What's 24 times 15?
[02:36:43.098 --> 02:36:53.080]  Hundreds and hundreds of mobile execution vans killing 24-7, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:58.082]  Huge stadiums with people cheering as mass executions take place.
[02:36:58.722 --> 02:37:02.002]  And the media and the culture is very good at keeping it quiet.
[02:37:02.523 --> 02:37:08.304]  Just like they're very good at keeping it quiet that Miss America was booed in Mexico City over the weekend.
[02:37:09.210 --> 02:37:32.158]  And that the government is importing a mass of people that have been told every evil they've ever been under was caused by the United States, brought in by the very globalists that have oppressed them, to then be used like a charging bull to overthrow the Republic, which is nothing more than the red sash being used to cause rage in the population.
[02:37:33.399 --> 02:37:36.520]  And as they tear through that red veil,
[02:37:37.754 --> 02:37:42.958]  The sword of the New World Order will drive through their hearts and we together will perish.
[02:37:43.438 --> 02:37:45.079]  The Red Veil and the Bull.
[02:37:49.042 --> 02:37:49.943]  Another analogy.
[02:37:51.404 --> 02:37:52.304]  Another parable.
[02:37:52.324 --> 02:38:03.152]  Alright, I said I'd answer your question and get to all this other news and other calls, but I'm running out of time here.
[02:38:05.093 --> 02:38:05.934]  How are they going to
[02:38:07.245 --> 02:38:15.187]  Continue their underground drug trade, but then have a capitalist society the same way the illegal aliens don't have to have IDs and will be within the system.
[02:38:15.987 --> 02:38:18.548]  They'll arrest a few token ones on the news to make you think they are.
[02:38:18.928 --> 02:38:21.209]  It's form over substance.
[02:38:21.289 --> 02:38:22.169]  It's the illusion.
[02:38:22.529 --> 02:38:24.070]  It's the facade.
[02:38:24.450 --> 02:38:26.310]  It's the spell.
[02:38:26.490 --> 02:38:32.552]  It is the mass hypnosis.
[02:38:35.595 --> 02:38:39.677]  The cash, with their own documents, is going to have biometrics in it.
[02:38:39.717 --> 02:38:40.257]  It already does.
[02:38:40.317 --> 02:38:40.998]  It can be scanned.
[02:38:41.018 --> 02:38:42.198]  It has a reader for the number.
[02:38:42.879 --> 02:38:53.024]  When you pay cash, you will then pay a national sales tax and you will swipe your card to apportion the tax under the fair tax the fake conservatives are pushing with total treachery.
[02:38:54.344 --> 02:38:54.664]  Am I right?
[02:38:55.405 --> 02:38:55.765]  Understand?
[02:38:58.223 --> 02:39:01.585]  And so they've always had it with the big foreign corporations.
[02:39:01.805 --> 02:39:03.966]  Let me answer the question this way.
[02:39:03.986 --> 02:39:19.173]  Remember six years ago, right before 9-11, Grasso, the head of the Newark Stock Exchange, Reuters photo in an article, went and was hugging the head of the FARC, communist guerrillas, presenting him with a letter from the presidency.
[02:39:19.453 --> 02:39:24.396]  It was already a law saying, please invest your drug proceeds in the stock market.
[02:39:24.456 --> 02:39:25.036]  It is legal.
[02:39:26.017 --> 02:39:26.937]  And they are embracing it.
[02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:28.711]  I mean, they don't hide it.
[02:39:28.731 --> 02:39:33.215]  It's on the cover of Reuters that the drug money is laundered through the banks in Wall Street.
[02:39:34.196 --> 02:39:36.398]  Chase Manhattan Citibank that basically owned Mexico.
[02:39:36.418 --> 02:39:38.700]  And they're trying to control the rest of the area.
[02:39:40.261 --> 02:39:41.182]  So there's your answer.
[02:39:41.222 --> 02:39:43.264]  They just will launder the digits.
[02:39:44.044 --> 02:39:45.626]  It's only illegal at the street level.
[02:39:46.186 --> 02:39:48.128]  Everybody knows it's legal at the high levels.
[02:39:48.789 --> 02:39:49.689]  It's not even illegal!
[02:39:52.104 --> 02:39:57.827]  These dumb cops will rake your house looking for cocaine and heroin that the government controls.
[02:40:00.489 --> 02:40:03.830]  Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
[02:40:06.112 --> 02:40:12.915]  Back when that stuff was legal at every drug store in the country, we had a lot lower level of drug use per capita, but you can't explain that to people.
[02:40:12.995 --> 02:40:14.456]  Fine, believe whatever you want.
[02:40:15.532 --> 02:40:23.139]  Then give your daughter the HPV shot and watch her die or have seizures and break out with Ebola-type symptoms as blood comes out of every orifice.
[02:40:23.659 --> 02:40:26.762]  By the way, Judicial Watch has put a big alert out on that over the weekend.
[02:40:27.322 --> 02:40:28.804]  I could have talked for three hours about that.
[02:40:29.124 --> 02:40:29.825]  There's no time.
[02:40:31.106 --> 02:40:33.628]  So the cashless society is only for you.
[02:40:34.529 --> 02:40:41.855]  And cash will still be used, it'll just be data-based on the cash's movements and how you used it, and you will see it gradually phasing out of cash.
[02:40:41.895 --> 02:40:42.536]  The head of Visa
[02:40:43.727 --> 02:40:46.569]  Has said by 2011 that it will be cashless.
[02:40:46.589 --> 02:40:47.350]  I don't believe that.
[02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:49.771]  But it might, because they're accelerating things so quickly.
[02:40:51.152 --> 02:40:52.573]  Does that answer your question, sir?
[02:40:54.975 --> 02:40:55.315]  He dropped.
[02:40:55.375 --> 02:40:55.875]  Okay, well good.
[02:40:56.916 --> 02:40:59.278]  Not good that he dropped, but good I answered his question, or he hung up.
[02:40:59.738 --> 02:41:01.099]  Let me just play this New York piece.
[02:41:01.379 --> 02:41:03.941]  This is a Giuliani confronted at New York fundraiser.
[02:41:03.961 --> 02:41:08.084]  Paul Watson has the inside scoop on this, and the fact that Giuliani's a liar.
[02:41:08.504 --> 02:41:12.587]  You should call WNBC, you should bombard them in the Drudge Report, everybody else, and demand
[02:41:13.689 --> 02:41:22.113]  With the PrisonPilot.com article we have, that they stopped saying that he told the truth and that he never said the towers were going to collapse, or that he knew they were.
[02:41:22.673 --> 02:41:26.195]  When we have the clip of him on ABC saying it, and we have him a few weeks ago saying it.
[02:41:27.576 --> 02:41:37.201]  Giuliani confronted at New York Fundraiser, a radical group at a Bronx Fundraiser, confronted Rudolph Giuliani on Tuesday morning, accusing him of being one of the criminals of 9-11.
[02:41:39.151 --> 02:41:40.413]  A radical group.
[02:41:40.433 --> 02:41:45.319]  Now notice they'll call terrorists radicals, which is too loose a term, too light a term.
[02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:47.843]  You always wonder, why do they call terrorists radicals?
[02:41:48.303 --> 02:41:53.490]  I mean, some Muslim group will blow up a school bus in Israel, and they'll call it a radical group, or an extreme group.
[02:41:54.171 --> 02:42:01.616]  Because then they're now double interchanging that word semantically in an Ingsoc translation as Orwell talked about.
[02:42:02.177 --> 02:42:15.085]  So now they can then use it against us but not get sued because it will now have its original use for anyone of a literary mind or anyone of the previous English language that it was unredacted and not pared back or changed or altered.
[02:42:15.586 --> 02:42:16.126]  You understand?
[02:42:16.146 --> 02:42:18.828]  See, so just in that line you see the whole manipulation.
[02:42:19.622 --> 02:42:20.903]  The destroying of words.
[02:42:21.123 --> 02:42:24.624]  The general public will hear that and have a thousand thousand.
[02:42:24.684 --> 02:42:27.145]  I mean, how many times have you heard them called terrorist?
[02:42:29.546 --> 02:42:33.548]  How many times have you heard them called terrorist radical groups, you see?
[02:42:33.588 --> 02:42:36.869]  And then they can interchange it with groups here in the U.S., see?
[02:42:37.049 --> 02:42:38.730]  And then the thought is terrorist.
[02:42:39.090 --> 02:42:44.172]  Words are literally symbols in the brain that bring up imagery.
[02:42:45.066 --> 02:42:52.889]  That when they do this type of deception, because they know you're not consciously looking for semantical manipulation, they literally are reaching in and lying to you.
[02:42:54.169 --> 02:42:54.909]  That's the problem.
[02:42:54.929 --> 02:43:03.452]  When I read an article, it's all stumble or falter or halt, because I'm having all these thoughts, all this integrated information rush by continually, and it's hard to even try to put it out there for you.
[02:43:04.187 --> 02:43:05.567]  Because everything is lies.
[02:43:05.627 --> 02:43:06.788]  Everything is crafted.
[02:43:06.808 --> 02:43:18.590]  And you can tell when it's a mainline reporter who's just part of the general mindset, who isn't a programmer, you can tell because they'll get most of the programming right but won't completely get it because all they're doing is copying programming they were taught.
[02:43:18.670 --> 02:43:21.551]  It's by training, not by actual consciousness.
[02:43:23.131 --> 02:43:24.491]  Now I'm getting off in a whole other area.
[02:43:25.772 --> 02:43:26.532]  And I'm running out of time.
[02:43:28.658 --> 02:43:34.261]  Again, a radical group at a Bronx fundraiser confronted Rudolph Giuliani on Tuesday morning, accusing him of being one of the criminals of 9-11.
[02:43:34.361 --> 02:43:43.746]  The Republican nominee for president was outside City Island's Seashore Restaurant in the Bronx, speaking with WNBC's Adam Shapiro about his fundraising in New York.
[02:43:43.866 --> 02:43:54.351]  Afterward, a young woman, who claimed to be the relative of a September 11th firefighter who died when the towers collapsed, asked Giuliani why he allegedly told Peter Jennings the towers would not fall that day.
[02:43:55.077 --> 02:43:56.859]  By the way, she was planning... I remember hearing about this.
[02:43:56.919 --> 02:43:58.460]  I had to refresh my memory.
[02:43:58.701 --> 02:43:59.782]  She was planning to get married.
[02:43:59.802 --> 02:44:03.345]  She was, you know, girlfriend of the fellow whose dad died.
[02:44:03.365 --> 02:44:04.346]  That's why she says she's family.
[02:44:05.026 --> 02:44:09.170]  But it did not stop the rescue efforts of firefighters and police officers.
[02:44:09.651 --> 02:44:14.275]  The woman claims Giuliani knew the towers would fall and allowed rescuers to go to their desks.
[02:44:14.315 --> 02:44:16.097]  She asked him, how do you sleep at night?
[02:44:16.664 --> 02:44:21.553]  Here is the video of InfoWars.com reporters confronting them.
[02:44:21.633 --> 02:44:24.438]  And the young lady, of course, is Sabrina Rivera.
[02:44:24.919 --> 02:44:25.300]  Here it is.
[02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:28.425]  Hi, I'm 911, I met you in October 2011.
[02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:29.907]  What's your name?
[02:44:29.927 --> 02:44:31.168]  Sabrina.
[02:44:31.388 --> 02:44:31.728]  Sabrina?
[02:44:31.768 --> 02:44:33.870]  You came from the town of Robert F. Wallace.
[02:44:33.991 --> 02:44:34.391]  Of course.
[02:44:34.531 --> 02:44:36.553]  I have a question for you.
[02:44:36.593 --> 02:44:36.673]  Yes.
[02:44:36.693 --> 02:44:41.137]  You reported to Peter Jennings that on 9-11 that the world trade towers were going to collapse.
[02:44:41.738 --> 02:44:44.721]  And... Excuse me.
[02:44:44.761 --> 02:44:48.585]  No steel structure in history has ever collapsed due to a fire.
[02:44:50.177 --> 02:44:52.138]  How come people in the buildings weren't notified?
[02:44:52.538 --> 02:44:55.019]  And who else knew about this?
[02:44:55.119 --> 02:44:56.519]  And how do you sleep at night?
[02:44:56.980 --> 02:44:58.880]  Ma'am, I didn't know that the towers were going to collapse.
[02:44:58.900 --> 02:44:59.861]  Did you report it on ABC?
[02:44:59.881 --> 02:45:00.081]  No, no.
[02:45:00.161 --> 02:45:03.722]  You said on ABC video that you were aware that the towers were going to collapse in advance.
[02:45:03.782 --> 02:45:07.383]  We'd like to know who told you the towers were going to collapse in advance, sir?
[02:45:20.012 --> 02:45:22.053]  And also we'd like to know, who else you told?
[02:45:22.073 --> 02:45:26.936]  Well the fact is that I didn't realize the towers would collapse, I never realized that.
[02:45:27.996 --> 02:45:32.259]  If I can complete the sentence, if you give me the courtesy to complete the sentence.
[02:45:32.679 --> 02:45:38.022]  Our understanding was that over a long period of time, the way other buildings collapse, the towers could collapse.
[02:45:38.082 --> 02:45:39.162]  Meaning over a 7, 8, 9, 10 hour period.
[02:45:40.934 --> 02:45:43.255]  No one that I knew of had any idea that they would implode.
[02:45:43.615 --> 02:45:44.676]  That was a complete surprise.
[02:45:44.716 --> 02:45:44.976]  Thank you.
[02:45:45.016 --> 02:45:45.356]  Thank you all.
[02:45:45.396 --> 02:45:45.616]  Thank you.
[02:45:45.636 --> 02:45:45.916]  Thank you.
[02:45:45.936 --> 02:45:46.136]  Thank you.
[02:45:46.156 --> 02:45:46.357]  Thank you.
[02:45:46.377 --> 02:45:46.697]  Thank you.
[02:45:46.717 --> 02:45:46.977]  Thank you.
[02:45:46.997 --> 02:45:47.237]  Thank you.
[02:45:47.257 --> 02:45:47.457]  Thank you.
[02:45:47.477 --> 02:45:47.677]  Thank you.
[02:45:47.697 --> 02:45:47.897]  Thank you.
[02:45:47.917 --> 02:45:48.097]  Thank you.
[02:45:48.117 --> 02:45:48.317]  Thank you.
[02:45:48.337 --> 02:45:48.517]  Thank you.
[02:45:48.537 --> 02:45:48.778]  Thank you.
[02:45:48.798 --> 02:45:49.038]  Thank you.
[02:45:49.078 --> 02:45:49.298]  Thank you.
[02:45:49.318 --> 02:45:49.578]  Thank you.
[02:45:49.598 --> 02:45:49.778]  Thank you.
[02:45:49.798 --> 02:45:49.998]  Thank you.
[02:45:50.018 --> 02:45:50.298]  Thank you.
[02:45:50.318 --> 02:45:50.518]  Thank you.
[02:45:50.538 --> 02:45:50.778]  Thank you.
[02:45:50.799 --> 02:45:51.039]  Thank you.
[02:45:51.059 --> 02:45:51.279]  Thank you.
[02:45:51.299 --> 02:45:51.519]  Thank you.
[02:45:51.539 --> 02:45:51.859]  Thank you.
[02:45:51.899 --> 02:45:52.159]  Thank you.
[02:45:52.179 --> 02:45:52.439]  Thank you.
[02:45:52.459 --> 02:45:52.639]  Thank you.
[02:45:52.659 --> 02:45:52.959]  Thank you.
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:53.260]  Thank you.
[02:45:53.280 --> 02:45:53.500]  Thank you.
[02:45:53.560 --> 02:45:53.780]  Thank you.
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:54.020]  Thank you.
[02:45:54.060 --> 02:45:54.320]  Thank you.
[02:45:54.340 --> 02:45:54.580]  Thank you.
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:54.840]  Thank you.
[02:45:54.860 --> 02:45:55.120]  Thank you.
[02:45:55.140 --> 02:45:55.401]  Thank you.
[02:45:55.421 --> 02:45:55.701]  Thank you.
[02:45:55.741 --> 02:45:55.941]  Thank you.
[02:45:55.981 --> 02:45:56.241]  Thank you.
[02:45:56.361 --> 02:45:56.781]  Thank you.
[02:45:56.801 --> 02:45:59.482]  Thank you.
[02:45:59.502 --> 02:45:59.823]  Thank you.
[02:45:59.843 --> 02:46:00.123]  Thank you.
[02:46:00.163 --> 02:46:00.403]  Thank you.
[02:46:00.443 --> 02:46:00.723]  Thank you.
[02:46:00.743 --> 02:46:01.023]  Thank you.
[02:46:01.043 --> 02:46:01.263]  Thank you.
[02:46:01.283 --> 02:46:01.623]  Thank you.
[02:46:01.643 --> 02:46:01.944]  Thank you.
[02:46:01.964 --> 02:46:02.264]  Thank you.
[02:46:02.304 --> 02:46:02.784]  Thank you.
[02:46:02.804 --> 02:46:03.124]  Thank you.
[02:46:03.144 --> 02:46:03.524]  Thank you.
[02:46:03.544 --> 02:46:03.764]  Thank you.
[02:46:03.844 --> 02:46:04.064]  Thank you.
[02:46:04.084 --> 02:46:04.485]  Thank you.
[02:46:04.505 --> 02:46:05.925]  Thank you.
[02:46:05.945 --> 02:46:06.205]  Thank you.
[02:46:06.265 --> 02:46:06.726]  Thank you.
[02:46:06.746 --> 02:46:07.326]  Thank you.
[02:46:07.346 --> 02:46:07.666]  Thank you.
[02:46:07.706 --> 02:46:07.946]  Thank you.
[02:46:07.966 --> 02:46:08.126]  Thank
[02:46:12.372 --> 02:46:16.055]  There is so much now I want to run through here in this final two segments.
[02:46:16.075 --> 02:46:17.335]  I'm sorry I can't take any more.
[02:46:17.355 --> 02:46:18.776]  Maybe I'll talk to Doc and a few others.
[02:46:18.796 --> 02:46:19.497]  We'll see if I have time.
[02:46:20.097 --> 02:46:23.159]  Blitz could be forced to give up meat, milk to fight global warming.
[02:46:23.220 --> 02:46:29.824]  See, they claim that the carbon dioxide and methane footprint is too big of cows and chickens and everything else.
[02:46:30.585 --> 02:46:32.346]  And so they can't eat that.
[02:46:32.426 --> 02:46:34.507]  But oh, don't worry, we'll have a tax on meat for you.
[02:46:34.547 --> 02:46:35.628]  See, it's social engineering.
[02:46:36.148 --> 02:46:38.190]  Oh, we want one-child policies now.
[02:46:38.996 --> 02:46:40.718]  You know, you can't have those light bulbs.
[02:46:40.758 --> 02:46:45.242]  See, it sounds reasonable, but then it leads into the Chinese model, which is the globalist model.
[02:46:46.383 --> 02:46:47.584]  This is a Paul Watson article.
[02:46:47.624 --> 02:46:53.330]  Climate hysteria reaches new heights after revelation that government is considering making population switch to vegan diet.
[02:46:53.991 --> 02:46:55.973]  Now, I know a lot of you are for vegan lifestyle.
[02:46:56.053 --> 02:46:56.313]  Fine.
[02:46:57.134 --> 02:46:58.535]  And see, this will sell you on it.
[02:46:59.116 --> 02:47:01.598]  And I know the meat's got a lot of problems, and a lot of problems in it.
[02:47:01.638 --> 02:47:03.480]  But the point is, this is control.
[02:47:04.961 --> 02:47:13.624]  By the way, the Houston Chronicle reported that the Feds have just announced, without even having a law, that, oh, we're allowing secret experimentation on anyone that comes to a hospital now.
[02:47:14.164 --> 02:47:15.744]  So they could talk for five hours about that.
[02:47:16.325 --> 02:47:17.565]  This is what tyranny is, folks.
[02:47:17.585 --> 02:47:19.426]  They just announced, hey, we're going to tax your meat.
[02:47:19.886 --> 02:47:22.827]  Hey, we're going to make you only have one child and put a fine on you.
[02:47:23.167 --> 02:47:25.427]  Hey, we're going to do medical experiments on you and not tell you.
[02:47:26.128 --> 02:47:27.808]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[02:47:28.828 --> 02:47:30.369]  Do you understand what's happening?
[02:47:31.115 --> 02:47:33.657]  Folks, I've got literally a 6-7 inch stack here.
[02:47:33.677 --> 02:47:34.578]  There's no way to cover it all.
[02:47:35.178 --> 02:47:35.819]  I've got this.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:39.422]  Tucker has found out with the Bilderberg Group meeting, as he believes.
[02:47:39.702 --> 02:47:40.683]  He's flying out today.
[02:47:40.703 --> 02:47:47.168]  He's going to be in the town of Silivri, about 40 miles from Istanbul.
[02:47:50.450 --> 02:47:52.252]  We've got just so much here.
[02:47:52.292 --> 02:47:53.813]  Folks, this is incredible.
[02:47:54.463 --> 02:47:56.365]  New York Times, email tax coming.
[02:47:56.945 --> 02:48:00.768]  The era of tax-free email, internet shopping, and broadband connections could end this fall.
[02:48:00.788 --> 02:48:03.130]  They spent $150 million last year lobbying.
[02:48:03.150 --> 02:48:04.151]  They said they're going to double it.
[02:48:04.712 --> 02:48:05.973]  If recent proposals in the U.S.
[02:48:06.013 --> 02:48:14.220]  Congress proceed, it says state and local governments this week resumed a push to lobby Congress for far-reaching changes on two different fronts.
[02:48:15.340 --> 02:48:16.842]  And that's why they're getting ready with Internet, too.
[02:48:18.268 --> 02:48:29.391]  And it just goes on to say, open tax on all internet connections, DSL, cable modem, all email, shopping carts, and of course they want the Feds to run it, the locals lobby.
[02:48:29.731 --> 02:48:34.312]  Boulder Dash, Cockamamie, Baloney, Bull.
[02:48:36.213 --> 02:48:37.433]  The Feds are going to administer this.
[02:48:37.473 --> 02:48:40.334]  This is the total grid, and the old boards to spare tax.
[02:48:42.054 --> 02:48:42.314]  Man.
[02:48:44.015 --> 02:48:44.595]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:48.527 --> 02:48:54.016]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.376 --> 02:49:01.968]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.719 --> 02:49:09.783]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.163 --> 02:49:21.589]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.909 --> 02:49:25.351]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.832 --> 02:49:27.773]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.133 --> 02:49:31.975]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:00.558 --> 02:51:05.478]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.678 --> 02:51:14.620]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:46.601 --> 02:51:51.742]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:52.423 --> 02:51:54.784]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:55.344 --> 02:51:56.444]  Oh, man.
[02:51:56.464 --> 02:51:58.545]  A lot of stations re-air the show.
[02:51:58.565 --> 02:52:04.347]  You can hear it 24-7 at Infowarriors.com, the three hours we streamed out, or sign up for the free podcast.
[02:52:05.207 --> 02:52:10.889]  That first hour interview with Luke Radowsky and his great team of Infowarriors was amazing.
[02:52:11.329 --> 02:52:12.650]  Now making national news.
[02:52:13.514 --> 02:52:15.936]  Wait till we get the David Rockefeller stuff and the rest of it.
[02:52:16.016 --> 02:52:16.597]  Oh my God.
[02:52:17.618 --> 02:52:18.439]  Stay tuned for that.
[02:52:21.862 --> 02:52:25.285]  Alabama terror website angers activists, Associated Press.
[02:52:25.785 --> 02:52:30.309]  Now the only reason this made it, because the gay rights groups finally read the manuals.
[02:52:30.889 --> 02:52:39.317]  Where it says anti-abortion groups, pro-property rights groups, second amendment groups, people that talk about the Constitution, it says that.
[02:52:40.592 --> 02:52:41.232]  ...are terrorists.
[02:52:41.333 --> 02:52:42.773]  And I've got... I meant to play it today.
[02:52:42.813 --> 02:52:43.394]  I'll play it tomorrow.
[02:52:43.414 --> 02:52:45.235]  I have all this video of the police saying it.
[02:52:45.255 --> 02:52:46.676]  I don't just have the training manuals.
[02:52:47.976 --> 02:52:53.520]  There's now complete freaking out and screaming and yelling because it lists gay rights groups as terrorists.
[02:52:54.780 --> 02:52:58.663]  Any activist, folks, anyone is a terrorist.
[02:52:58.683 --> 02:53:02.545]  That's what I keep trying to explain to everybody under Section 802 of the Patriot Act.
[02:53:03.166 --> 02:53:04.367]  This is Associated Press.
[02:53:04.447 --> 02:53:06.028]  Terror website angers activists.
[02:53:06.549 --> 02:53:14.975]  The Alabama Department of Homeland Security has taken down a website it operated that included gay rights and anti-war organizations, and a list of groups that could include terrorists.
[02:53:15.456 --> 02:53:22.381]  But don't worry, they're going to keep pro-life groups in there, and they're going to keep gun rights groups in there, and they're going to keep property rights groups in there, of course.
[02:53:27.625 --> 02:53:29.106]  It's the new America, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:29.146 --> 02:53:32.249]  Jane Stanley, who's talked about Building 7 falling before it fell,
[02:53:33.152 --> 02:53:37.556]  She got called up by a university student and confronted about it.
[02:53:37.576 --> 02:53:40.097]  You can hear the fear in her voice saying she can't talk about it and hanging up.
[02:53:41.719 --> 02:53:44.841]  New York, page 6, Rupert Murdoch's publication.
[02:53:44.861 --> 02:53:46.482]  Trying to do a bunch of spin this weekend.
[02:53:46.502 --> 02:53:49.645]  Because Charlie Sheen's never signed a contract to do loose change final cut.
[02:53:49.685 --> 02:53:50.425]  The film isn't done.
[02:53:50.706 --> 02:53:53.168]  He'll decide when it's basically done if he wants to do the voiceover or not.
[02:53:57.125 --> 02:54:01.028]  So, page 6 heard us talk about that on air, basically, is what happened.
[02:54:01.428 --> 02:54:04.750]  And so they went and did the spin of, he doesn't believe in 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:54:04.770 --> 02:54:10.353]  Well, other publications that wrote about their story said that, and Rosie doesn't believe it anymore, and it's all over, 9-11 Truth's dead.
[02:54:10.874 --> 02:54:11.574]  It was a lie.
[02:54:11.594 --> 02:54:14.856]  You know, rumors of my deceasure have been greatly exaggerated, as they say.
[02:54:15.857 --> 02:54:17.138]  But this is how they operate.
[02:54:18.479 --> 02:54:20.460]  This is how they operate, and this is what they did.
[02:54:21.508 --> 02:54:23.970]  And he got picked up everywhere, so Charlie Sheen put a statement out.
[02:54:24.810 --> 02:54:32.916]  I called him yesterday and he sent me an email statement saying that he knows it's 9-11 and he's been investigated and he's never changed one iota and this is all just made up.
[02:54:36.639 --> 02:54:38.720]  And that he's going to see loose change when it's done in a few months.
[02:54:39.961 --> 02:54:42.122]  Some parties are rushing to get loose change out now.
[02:54:42.182 --> 02:54:46.626]  I think we've got to wait and let them do it right so we then can have Charlie and folks involved.
[02:54:47.774 --> 02:54:51.116]  I'm just an executive producer, I don't call all the shots, so whatever happens, happens.
[02:54:51.136 --> 02:54:53.258]  But it's going to be a good film, know that, and you're going to get to see it.
[02:54:54.018 --> 02:54:58.821]  If you want to get Terror Storm, Loose Change, Second Edition, all that stuff is on InfoWars.com.
