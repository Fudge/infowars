[00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:32.952]  You are listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:40.756]  Big Brother.
[00:00:41.397 --> 00:00:42.477]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:44.318]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:45.759]  You want answers?
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.021]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:51.743]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:52.263 --> 00:00:56.326]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.663]  Welcome everyone listening in the United States and across the world, as well as the ships at sea.
[00:01:08.957 --> 00:01:10.418]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:10.478 --> 00:01:14.780]  It is already the third day of 2007, the third day of January 2007.
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.102]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:01:19.643 --> 00:01:30.949]  We have two guests, both fighting against the Orwellian police state that is encroaching on all of our lives at an increasing and more frequent rate, joining us in the third hour.
[00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:52.121]  One of them follows in a long train of listeners, and this stuff has been in the newspaper by the way, in many of these cases, where listeners simply give people terror storms, road to tyrannies, and the BATF assaults them, the police arrest them, the state police arrest them.
[00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:58.824]  I have a registered nurse coming on in the third hour, Shirley Anderson,
[00:01:59.873 --> 00:02:01.253]  And she wrote a letter to the editor.
[00:02:01.313 --> 00:02:02.594]  That's her main crime.
[00:02:02.614 --> 00:02:03.534]  That's how it started.
[00:02:03.614 --> 00:02:05.855]  They wanted her to go under psychological evaluation.
[00:02:06.355 --> 00:02:08.036]  Her letter to the editor is very well written.
[00:02:08.056 --> 00:02:12.417]  In fact, we're going to publish this up on jonesreport.com in the next 30 minutes.
[00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:21.220]  And very well written, just about the history of the military-industrial complex and the police state, and that the government's involved in 9-11.
[00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:27.006]  And in her small town, it's kind of like invasion of the body snatchers.
[00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.927]  If you're not one of them, it's very upsetting.
[00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:34.969]  They knocked down her door, busted her head open, unannounced, didn't even knock.
[00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:40.090]  And then they do what they always do, they charge you with assault when you just lay there and take it.
[00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.711]  Kind of like in New Orleans, the cops gun down two innocent people.
[00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:52.539]  Then arrest the brother of the retarded man they killed just to try to cover it up.
[00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:53.800]  See, that's the big crime.
[00:02:54.201 --> 00:03:00.826]  I can understand in a melee, in a hysteria, being untrained boobs.
[00:03:01.606 --> 00:03:04.809]  And please don't send me an email saying that's profane.
[00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.312]  A boob is a type of South Pacific pirate.
[00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:14.797]  The point is, behaving like a bunch of pirates and shooting people, that's just...
[00:03:15.898 --> 00:03:26.647]  Serious negligence, but then trying to frame people that you've injured or who you've murdered people in front of, it's just unbelievable.
[00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:31.631]  We'll play a clip concerning that coming up in this hour, but she's joining us.
[00:03:32.071 --> 00:03:34.313]  And then some family friends, and I'd say they're acquaintances.
[00:03:34.393 --> 00:03:43.500]  I've met the husband three or four times, and I know the mother of the wife pretty darn good for about, I guess, eight years or so.
[00:03:45.043 --> 00:03:47.964]  I've even been to the local fair with their children and my children.
[00:03:49.804 --> 00:03:51.924]  She had bloodshot eyes from allergies.
[00:03:52.204 --> 00:03:55.265]  Frankly, I have a bloodshot eye right now from allergies.
[00:03:56.385 --> 00:03:59.465]  And so they thought that must be evidence of drugs.
[00:03:59.565 --> 00:04:01.146]  I know the family, they don't even drink.
[00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:09.067]  And so, in fact, when I was talking to the husband last night, he's been a teetotaler for 23 years, AA I guess.
[00:04:09.907 --> 00:04:14.288]  But it didn't matter, bloodshot eyes, boom, CPS is hitting them, hitting them hard.
[00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:16.969]  That's how America works.
[00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.432]  I hope nobody sees my bloodshot eye, but it's only one today.
[00:04:20.452 --> 00:04:21.433]  I have allergies.
[00:04:21.473 --> 00:04:23.474]  I wake up with like one huge bloodshot eye.
[00:04:23.495 --> 00:04:27.198]  Kind of scary looking, but again, I'm evil too.
[00:04:27.898 --> 00:04:30.320]  This is the secret police country we live in.
[00:04:32.942 --> 00:04:39.248]  And again, James Panik coming up in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[00:04:39.268 --> 00:04:43.091]  With the CPS after him.
[00:04:44.085 --> 00:04:48.587]  And again, this isn't... we get probably ten calls a day, people having CPS grab their kids all over the country.
[00:04:48.907 --> 00:04:51.228]  These are people I know, okay?
[00:04:51.248 --> 00:04:53.028]  These are people I know.
[00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:56.570]  And, uh, their daughter's eleven.
[00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.671]  Just wait till you hear the story.
[00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:02.352]  It's coming up.
[00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:08.054]  In the meantime, I do want to have open phones today in the first two hours.
[00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:08.094]  1-800.
[00:05:11.886 --> 00:05:12.566]  2-5-9-92-31-1-800-2-5-9-9-2-3-1.
[00:05:12.586 --> 00:05:19.390]  Think Tank.
[00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.572]  Israel could attack Iran's nuclear program alone.
[00:05:23.632 --> 00:05:25.293]  This is out of Harass.
[00:05:26.533 --> 00:05:29.535]  Also, Daddy Bush attacks JFK conspiracy theories.
[00:05:29.575 --> 00:05:30.735]  We confirm he did do that.
[00:05:30.755 --> 00:05:34.177]  2006 was a deadly year for journalists and more.
[00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:44.336]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:44.696 --> 00:05:52.341]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:53.027 --> 00:06:00.069]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:11.873]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:16.135]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:18.116]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:18.436 --> 00:06:22.257]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:36.524]  Terrorism!
[00:06:36.684 --> 00:06:37.444]  Terrorism!
[00:06:37.544 --> 00:06:43.589]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:45.451]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:48.173]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:48.553 --> 00:07:03.124]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:07:03.184 --> 00:07:03.504]  government.
[00:07:03.665 --> 00:07:05.366]  Anyone can follow the simple instruction.
[00:07:05.586 --> 00:07:11.749]  This is presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:16.352]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:07:16.632 --> 00:07:22.255]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:22.355 --> 00:07:23.935]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:23.995 --> 00:07:26.056]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:41.398]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:41.618 --> 00:07:43.380]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:49.927]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:50.227 --> 00:07:56.354]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Wright discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:58.436]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:58.696 --> 00:07:59.136]  I think so.
[00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:22.642]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:50.013 --> 00:08:56.014]  Alright, got two police state cases coming up in the third hour, as I mentioned in the last segment.
[00:08:57.775 --> 00:09:00.856]  One out of Washington State, the other out of Austin, Texas.
[00:09:03.176 --> 00:09:04.657]  Or a suburb of Austin.
[00:09:05.957 --> 00:09:15.039]  Also, I'll probably have Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes in briefly in the second hour to give you a play-by-play of what developed
[00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:27.547]  Out at the official family living center, the FEMA camp, being operated by private contractors with Homeland Security in Taylor, Texas.
[00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:33.489]  A lot happened after the show ended yesterday.
[00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:43.411]  Also, I didn't finish playing clips of a Twilight Zone episode, The Obsolete Man, so we'll play the last five minutes of that coming up in the second hour as well.
[00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:45.551]  In this hour, I have a CNN clip
[00:09:46.658 --> 00:09:48.799]  Well, the real crime is hidden in plain view.
[00:09:49.699 --> 00:10:06.604]  You've got these police gunning down some people, and then you've got in a gangland show of support the hundreds of police officers lining up to cheer them as triumphant centurions coming back into Rome.
[00:10:08.004 --> 00:10:14.786]  But there's an interesting little edge to all of it that I'll point out.
[00:10:15.851 --> 00:10:16.331]  Coming up.
[00:10:16.751 --> 00:10:27.935]  Also in India, they found a house full of a whole bunch of body parts of small children with two degenerate pieces of filth that were in there raping, torturing, and killing them.
[00:10:28.555 --> 00:10:36.018]  And I think I'll air this, because it dovetails with a BBC report today, a London Telegraph report as well, about what the UN does to children.
[00:10:36.518 --> 00:10:44.141]  Just because the general public needs to figure out there are evil people out there, and they're not just in
[00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:50.425]  They're not just in dirty houses, you know, off the side of a slum in India.
[00:10:50.965 --> 00:10:52.285]  They're right here in the U.S.
[00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:55.246]  and they tend to get into positions of power.
[00:10:56.426 --> 00:11:02.767]  And their main goal is to set up an all-powerful government so no one can escape them to start killing.
[00:11:03.447 --> 00:11:14.609]  And if you know anything about history, that scary statement I just made will be illustrated to you as, well, just prima facie evidence.
[00:11:15.936 --> 00:11:16.857]  Red-handed evidence.
[00:11:19.799 --> 00:11:23.222]  Really, you can separate people on this planet into a few different groups.
[00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:42.239]  There are folks that just never get a clue, never figure out what life is really all about, who mean well and are manipulated by different elements of the global crime syndicate into exerting their energies into
[00:11:43.596 --> 00:11:51.738]  What they would see is charity, but what is actually used to oppress and dumb down and, yes, kill large numbers of our fellow humans.
[00:11:53.339 --> 00:11:57.880]  Then you've got two other groups, and there's different subgroups of each group.
[00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:06.862]  And you've got one group that only cares about themselves, that is constantly, 110% focused on satiating
[00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:14.416]  Uh, their most base desires and appetites.
[00:12:17.197 --> 00:12:30.861]  And then you've got individuals who I wouldn't call saintly or, you know, even pious, but who understand that life is literally a flash in the pan.
[00:12:32.506 --> 00:12:43.369]  And who feel that they're part of a, who can feel that they're part of a larger continuity of human society and history and family.
[00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.051]  I mean, we're all gonna wake up dead.
[00:12:47.251 --> 00:12:49.031]  You're gonna, it's gonna seem like tomorrow.
[00:12:49.171 --> 00:12:50.232]  Life goes by like that.
[00:12:51.292 --> 00:12:53.733]  If you're young, really young, you probably haven't figured this out yet.
[00:12:53.813 --> 00:12:55.613]  By the time you get to be middle-aged, you will.
[00:12:56.313 --> 00:12:58.714]  That so many people you know around you die.
[00:12:59.114 --> 00:13:00.495]  So many people you've loved die.
[00:13:02.876 --> 00:13:09.700]  So many people you respect, you see them fall, you see them break down, you see them die, and that's part of the process of life.
[00:13:10.861 --> 00:13:17.124]  And you're supposed to become a better person as you get older, not a more decadent and wicked person as you get older.
[00:13:18.245 --> 00:13:30.092]  And really, if you want to get down to base psychology, the most evil of the earlier group I mentioned, the second group I mentioned, of the three who
[00:13:31.918 --> 00:13:33.258]  Only care about themselves?
[00:13:34.059 --> 00:13:39.060]  Well, by the time those type of individuals get old, they hate the young.
[00:13:41.301 --> 00:13:45.082]  You know, angry old man, mean old man, mean old woman.
[00:13:47.543 --> 00:13:51.384]  And they despise the young who are now having their time in the sun.
[00:13:54.725 --> 00:13:59.086]  And a lot of these Dr. Scrooge types, Mr. Scrooge types,
[00:14:01.155 --> 00:14:03.697]  Don't have a family, or if they do, their family doesn't like them.
[00:14:04.398 --> 00:14:10.263]  Or if they raised their children, they raised them wrong to be self-centered, so they're not taking care of them, so there's no relationship.
[00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:27.858]  And so really, at the end, they just want to deal out death to everybody else, because all they've got is their own personal selfish life, and so in some weird psychological ism that they project, they go around trying to enslave and hurt and abuse and kill people.
[00:14:30.606 --> 00:14:31.466]  And again, I'll state it.
[00:14:32.046 --> 00:14:34.027]  History is our teacher on this.
[00:14:35.187 --> 00:14:43.329]  We have the revelation of history, watching other people's mistakes, seeing how humans behave and interact over and over again the exact same way.
[00:14:46.530 --> 00:14:59.874]  You see, I take every moment as a precious jewel, and every day as a gift from God, and I am completely driven to try to lay down foundations that are
[00:15:00.758 --> 00:15:04.842]  Good for my children, and hence their children, and their children, and their children will come after them.
[00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:05.663]  I mean, think about it.
[00:15:05.683 --> 00:15:06.724]  You love your children, don't you?
[00:15:06.744 --> 00:15:07.665]  You love your grandchildren.
[00:15:07.685 --> 00:15:10.687]  Those of you that are blessed enough to be alive, well, you have great-grandchildren.
[00:15:10.707 --> 00:15:12.589]  You love them as much as you love your own children.
[00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:14.591]  In a way, maybe even more.
[00:15:16.132 --> 00:15:19.796]  Wouldn't you love a great-great-great-great-grandchild if you could meet them?
[00:15:21.658 --> 00:15:25.101]  Or how about your progeny a thousand generations?
[00:15:26.445 --> 00:15:42.581]  And every major civilization that was built, every gleaming civilization, every civilization that revolutionized technology and brought humanity forward was based on the core issue of we're not going to be here long.
[00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:46.465]  We need to leave a better world for those that are coming after us.
[00:15:46.505 --> 00:15:47.386]  We need to have honor.
[00:15:47.406 --> 00:15:48.427]  We need to have courage.
[00:15:49.388 --> 00:15:50.349]  We need to have duty.
[00:15:52.583 --> 00:16:12.564]  But those societies always build themselves up, they always have incredible success, and then as soon as people stop caring about each other, and as soon as people stop caring about justice, and as soon as people start saying, ah, things are corrupt, that's the way it's always been, and get that cynical spirit, that sickness, societies burn out within decades.
[00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:25.515]  They fall in relatively short periods of time, and we are now falling like a comet towards the Earth, burning out, burning out like a cinder, burning bright.
[00:16:27.576 --> 00:16:38.460]  And I sit here in literal, white-knuckled horror to know that the very people that set up the Communists and the Fascists, the very people that installed Mao Zedong,
[00:16:39.108 --> 00:16:50.992]  The very people who have introduced AIDS, there's no doubting it, we have the Pentagon documents, the Navy documents, introduced AIDS to Africa and Asia, and we have the documents in the 50's where they wanted to develop it.
[00:16:52.192 --> 00:17:05.437]  The very people that have caused millions of children to be brain damaged from mercury in the shots, they are setting up a literal wonderland, a butcher shop for a bunch of hounds to go in and just feed.
[00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:13.748]  And they're lovingly crafting and laying it down and carving every, every edge of this juggernaut.
[00:17:14.108 --> 00:17:16.649]  And oiling it and petting it and kissing it.
[00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:21.451]  And just looking at us with literal eyes that burn like the pits of hell.
[00:17:22.732 --> 00:17:27.034]  And I'm just sitting here looking at this army building, massing, feeding on us now.
[00:17:27.054 --> 00:17:29.054]  I mean, but you think this is bad?
[00:17:29.094 --> 00:17:30.375]  This is only a prelude.
[00:17:32.543 --> 00:17:35.744]  So I'm beating my drum and I'm saying, look, look, look!
[00:17:36.285 --> 00:17:37.445]  The enemy is already here.
[00:17:37.505 --> 00:17:39.106]  It's vanguard has already overrun us.
[00:17:39.346 --> 00:17:40.866]  But look at the main host!
[00:17:41.207 --> 00:17:44.308]  The legion upon legion upon legion!
[00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:52.591]  And that's what happens when you only submerse yourself in the flesh.
[00:17:53.892 --> 00:17:56.873]  And I'm not sitting here saying I'm not someone who's attracted to the flesh.
[00:17:57.273 --> 00:17:58.874]  I'm a very fleshly person.
[00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:01.675]  I've been very worldly.
[00:18:02.563 --> 00:18:03.123]  In my life.
[00:18:05.185 --> 00:18:06.706]  Not for the last 10 years or so.
[00:18:10.289 --> 00:18:16.894]  And I know that if you go into darkness, and as you get deeper into it, most people don't turn back.
[00:18:17.214 --> 00:18:18.555]  They just keep falling.
[00:18:19.396 --> 00:18:26.662]  And they get, their whole soul literally gets turned over to wickedness.
[00:18:29.818 --> 00:18:35.040]  You know, talking to top psychiatrists and psychologists who studied serial killers, it's like they're not alive.
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.521]  They're like zombies.
[00:18:37.721 --> 00:18:40.642]  Except when they're getting some woman in a car.
[00:18:40.723 --> 00:18:42.043]  Except when they're bounding them.
[00:18:42.123 --> 00:18:43.864]  Except when they're raping them and killing them.
[00:18:44.844 --> 00:18:46.745]  And they describe it as a white light.
[00:18:46.785 --> 00:18:49.786]  It's like they're alive when they're doing that.
[00:18:50.567 --> 00:18:51.467]  It's like a drug addict.
[00:18:52.563 --> 00:18:53.704]  That's how evil works.
[00:18:53.784 --> 00:19:00.348]  Small dosage, huge effect up front, and by the end you're taking massive quantities and you don't even feel good.
[00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:13.497]  And so I want you to know that Queen Beatrice of the Netherlands, and the Queen of England, and David Rockefeller, and Lord Rothschild, they want to kill your children.
[00:19:14.702 --> 00:19:17.544]  They want to take your swimming pools and your nice houses.
[00:19:18.044 --> 00:19:22.107]  But more importantly, they want to take your minds and literature and thought.
[00:19:22.628 --> 00:19:25.890]  They are envious of your incredible intelligence and your beauty.
[00:19:26.771 --> 00:19:30.253]  They're envious of the freedom that our forefathers built.
[00:19:31.514 --> 00:19:33.095]  They are threatened by you.
[00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:34.837]  They are totally greedy.
[00:19:35.197 --> 00:19:40.881]  And they want to get rid of the majority of the population so that they can then publicly
[00:19:42.124 --> 00:19:45.908]  Use the life extension technologies and other things they've developed for themselves.
[00:19:45.948 --> 00:20:05.425]  You know, they openly say, and I told you this long before it was in main print, now it's all over the newspapers, that while we can't let life extension be given to the general public with six and a half billion people, while the world's overpopulated, we've got to reduce the population and then we can have a more well-refined, eugenic, racial hygiene elite that will then go on to the stars.
[00:20:09.016 --> 00:20:23.926]  And so while you play out there and watch your football and drink your beer, and while you always try to feed the satyr in yourself, you're losing what life is really all about.
[00:20:26.647 --> 00:20:30.570]  We'll be right back and I'll get into the news, your phone calls and a lot more.
[00:20:36.101 --> 00:20:39.664]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:20:39.704 --> 00:20:40.205]  are located?
[00:20:40.425 --> 00:20:43.808]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:20:44.048 --> 00:20:48.752]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:20:49.032 --> 00:20:55.958]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, proving environmental catastrophes.
[00:20:56.178 --> 00:20:56.478]  I think so.
[00:21:14.892 --> 00:21:15.313]  I think so.
[00:21:35.888 --> 00:21:38.350]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:38.831 --> 00:21:44.376]  Did you know that communism has stated that America would not jump from capitalism to communism?
[00:21:44.396 --> 00:21:52.964]  That our elected leaders would pass laws to socialize America and one day we would wake up and have socialism communism and not even know how it happened?
[00:21:53.784 --> 00:21:58.208]  Have we seen this very type of socialization of America over the last 60 years?
[00:21:59.209 --> 00:22:04.314]  We've been pushed far down the slippery slope of socialism-communism and don't even know it.
[00:22:04.414 --> 00:22:06.196]  Just as Nikita Khrushchev said.

[00:23:34.858 --> 00:23:38.761]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:23:38.981 --> 00:23:51.271]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:23:51.672 --> 00:23:52.092]  The U.S.
[00:23:52.132 --> 00:23:57.697]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:23:58.117 --> 00:24:00.319]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.241]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:24:03.281 --> 00:24:06.123]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:24:06.243 --> 00:24:12.268]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:24:12.688 --> 00:24:16.031]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:24:16.111 --> 00:24:22.456]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:24:23.016 --> 00:24:27.019]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:24:27.139 --> 00:24:27.340]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:27.560]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.421]  Federal agents!
[00:24:36.621 --> 00:24:38.924]  We are armed!
[00:24:56.764 --> 00:24:57.865]  We're good to go.
[00:25:15.394 --> 00:25:22.183]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[00:25:22.463 --> 00:25:25.026]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[00:25:25.307 --> 00:25:27.389]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:29.252]  Picture me buying this scam.
[00:25:29.352 --> 00:25:30.173]  I said never.
[00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:30.853]  Yeah!
[00:26:00.994 --> 00:26:02.415]  We'll never see.
[00:26:22.708 --> 00:26:25.148]  Now ask yourself, who's the one with the most to gain?
[00:26:25.368 --> 00:26:27.789]  On 9-11 last year, you couldn't stand his name.
[00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:30.489]  Now even now, he's waving flags like they lost their mind.
[00:26:30.769 --> 00:26:32.990]  Everybody got opinions, but don't know the time.
[00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.590]  Cause America's been took, it's plain to see.
[00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:40.651]  The oldest trick in the book is make your enemy a phony evil so the government can do its dirt.
[00:26:41.011 --> 00:26:43.332]  And take away your freedom, lock and load, beat and search.
[00:26:43.472 --> 00:26:46.072]  Ain't nothing changed, but more colored people locked in prison.
[00:26:46.192 --> 00:26:48.613]  These pigs still beat us, but it seems we forgetting.
[00:26:48.813 --> 00:26:51.173]  But I remember 4 September, how these devils do it.
[00:26:51.813 --> 00:26:53.915]  Giuliani at Diallo, how he doin'?
[00:26:54.015 --> 00:26:56.376]  We in the streets, holler, jail to the feet, follow.
[00:26:56.756 --> 00:26:58.818]  Waving flags, bring these wagons to their knees.
[00:26:59.158 --> 00:27:01.319]  Oil, blood, money, make these killers ride cold.
[00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:04.081]  Suspicious suicide, people dying, never told.
[00:27:04.481 --> 00:27:07.023]  It's all a part of playing God, so you think we need him?
[00:27:07.063 --> 00:27:09.565]  Walk in, ass crossed, take away your rights to freedom.
[00:27:09.605 --> 00:27:12.166]  Bear witness to the sickness of these dictators.
[00:27:12.426 --> 00:27:14.808]  Hope you understand the time, brother, cause it's major.
[00:27:14.988 --> 00:27:16.849]  Why can't you tell us what you're doing?
[00:27:16.989 --> 00:27:18.991]  It's not like things we know.
[00:27:25.898 --> 00:27:29.321]  So now you asking why my records always come the same.
[00:27:29.361 --> 00:27:30.903]  Keep it real, ain't no fillers.
[00:27:40.353 --> 00:27:40.853]  We're good to go.
[00:27:59.362 --> 00:27:59.523]  Let's go!
[00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.970]  We're good to go.
[00:28:52.458 --> 00:29:02.923]  You know, I really ought to take that song out of the Rotation lineup, because every time it plays, it's so good, so good even three and a half years after Parris put it out, that I just have to listen to it.
[00:29:04.263 --> 00:29:07.685]  I know we got James and Yvette and Joe and Chris and Ron, everybody else.
[00:29:07.805 --> 00:29:12.707]  I will go to you when we start the next segment, and then I will cover
[00:29:13.374 --> 00:29:13.934]  Think Tank.
[00:29:14.014 --> 00:29:16.515]  Israel could attack Iran's nuclear program alone.
[00:29:16.535 --> 00:29:17.455]  This is out of Heratz.
[00:29:18.795 --> 00:29:24.816]  Daddy Bush, involved in the JFK assassination, says that it doesn't matter what the public says.
[00:29:24.836 --> 00:29:27.157]  It doesn't matter if 92% know the government killed him.
[00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:30.477]  He says what Gerald Ford said at the Warren Commission stands.
[00:29:31.098 --> 00:29:32.578]  Yeah, keep on dreaming, devil!
[00:29:33.978 --> 00:29:35.879]  Also, 2006, a deadly year for journalists.
[00:29:38.976 --> 00:29:41.497]  We'll be covering that report from CBC.
[00:29:42.137 --> 00:29:44.558]  Also, official held in Saddam hanging video.
[00:29:44.578 --> 00:29:45.318]  They won't say who.
[00:29:45.738 --> 00:29:52.640]  If you believe they really arrested somebody or they're punishing somebody for that staged video they released, I got a bridge I'll be happy to sell you.
[00:29:53.581 --> 00:30:00.603]  Also, we will get into what's happening with the former head of the National Hurricane Center now leaving.
[00:30:01.283 --> 00:30:03.544]  What he's saying for the next hurricane season.
[00:30:04.024 --> 00:30:05.585]  Also, billionaire boom in China.
[00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:06.685]  Stock markets soar.
[00:30:07.938 --> 00:30:13.599]  We'll talk some about inflation here in the U.S., how they're privatizing law enforcement, U.N.
[00:30:13.659 --> 00:30:23.081]  staff accused of raping children in Sudan, Toyota, as we told you, is going to put breathalyzers in all their new cars, and a lot more coming up.
[00:30:23.101 --> 00:30:24.821]  Stay with us.
[00:30:26.102 --> 00:30:27.042]  We're on the march.
[00:30:27.482 --> 00:30:29.122]  The empire's on the run.
[00:30:30.022 --> 00:30:32.723]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:36.098 --> 00:30:37.679]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:46.607]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[00:30:46.967 --> 00:30:52.711]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[00:30:53.092 --> 00:31:00.558]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:02.159]  Davis Products is offering
[00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:02.459]  I think so.
[00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:19.994]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?
[00:31:20.274 --> 00:31:24.575]  Davis Products Memorial Markers are only $9 a piece and can be ordered by calling 814-827-4946.
[00:31:24.615 --> 00:31:24.956]  That's 814-827-4946.
[00:31:25.076 --> 00:31:26.156]  Or visit Davis-Products.com.
[00:31:26.256 --> 00:31:27.576]  That's Davis-Products.com.
[00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:38.140]  Shelly, you look exhausted.
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:39.020]  What's wrong?
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.321]  I am so tired.
[00:31:40.381 --> 00:31:42.843]  I just get so hot at night and can't sleep.
[00:31:43.003 --> 00:31:44.083]  I have tried everything.
[00:31:44.143 --> 00:31:45.904]  All kinds of fans, sheets, pillows.
[00:31:46.045 --> 00:31:47.205]  You name it, I've tried it.
[00:31:47.325 --> 00:31:49.627]  My husband has always been a hot sleeper.
[00:31:49.787 --> 00:31:51.348]  He's never had a good night's sleep.
[00:31:51.568 --> 00:31:53.669]  Then we discovered something that really helped.
[00:31:53.729 --> 00:31:55.970]  It's called the BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:31:56.150 --> 00:31:56.671]  The what?
[00:31:56.931 --> 00:31:59.012]  The BedFan Personal Cooling System.
[00:31:59.152 --> 00:32:04.475]  It will keep you cool all night long and will work for everyone that sleeps hot, no matter what the reason.
[00:32:04.655 --> 00:32:05.736]  You can see it at BedFan.
[00:32:06.776 --> 00:32:07.897]  How well are you sleeping?
[00:32:08.117 --> 00:32:09.777]  Are you getting the rest your body needs?

[00:32:37.382 --> 00:32:40.904]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:32:42.125 --> 00:32:46.928]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:32:47.148 --> 00:32:49.890]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:32:49.930 --> 00:32:51.050]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:32:52.391 --> 00:32:56.994]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:32:57.915 --> 00:33:05.099]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:33:06.152 --> 00:33:09.573]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:33:10.133 --> 00:33:14.814]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:33:20.596 --> 00:33:26.457]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:33:27.137 --> 00:33:27.437]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:33:27.457 --> 00:33:27.757]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:34:00.035 --> 00:34:11.898]  I wish that I could fly, into the sky, to very high, just like a dragonfly.
[00:34:11.978 --> 00:34:19.580]  I'd fly above the trees, over the seas, and on the greens, to anywhere I please.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:26.701]  Oh, I want to get away, I want to fly,
[00:34:30.467 --> 00:34:30.887]  Welcome back!
[00:34:30.907 --> 00:34:33.588]  Alright, we're going to go to your phones, calls.
[00:34:34.508 --> 00:34:35.468]  Jam-packed show today.
[00:34:35.508 --> 00:34:36.709]  Third hour is going to be really important.
[00:34:36.749 --> 00:34:37.449]  Be sure and tune in.
[00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:39.970]  Let's just get this out of the way right now.
[00:34:39.990 --> 00:34:41.070]  This is CNN.
[00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:52.873]  Last night, it's up on PrisonPlanet.com, and the police are the seven cops that shot a bunch of people on a bridge, including people that were supposedly shooting at them.
[00:34:53.873 --> 00:34:56.614]  We don't even know if that's true, though, because of the congenital lying.
[00:34:58.157 --> 00:34:59.177]  That's the problem here.
[00:34:59.217 --> 00:35:00.118]  I'd like to believe them.
[00:35:00.138 --> 00:35:01.958]  Believe me, I'd like to think we weren't in so much trouble.
[00:35:02.999 --> 00:35:06.480]  But anyone who tries to defend New Orleans PD is crazy.
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:11.541]  They are the most corrupt police force, hands down, in the U.S.
[00:35:12.602 --> 00:35:16.743]  But listen to this, because then it goes into after they shoot this guy's unarmed, retarded brother.
[00:35:17.903 --> 00:35:22.245]  They're trying to walk out on a highway overpass, which were open.
[00:35:22.285 --> 00:35:23.405]  They just wouldn't let people get out.
[00:35:24.686 --> 00:35:25.946]  And back behind them,
[00:35:27.373 --> 00:35:28.834]  Supposedly, somebody shoots.
[00:35:29.294 --> 00:35:29.975]  Probably wasn't.
[00:35:30.015 --> 00:35:30.795]  Probably was a cop.
[00:35:31.336 --> 00:35:31.856]  You never know.
[00:35:31.956 --> 00:35:39.341]  We know in some of the other cases, cops were shooting at cops, because a cop would shoot at an alligator, and then cops would hear it and just fire in the general direction.
[00:35:39.682 --> 00:35:40.482]  I mean, it was bedlam.
[00:35:40.502 --> 00:35:41.863]  And look, I expect some of that to happen.
[00:35:41.903 --> 00:35:50.429]  I'm not... Again, it could have just been a negligent homicide, or just negligence.
[00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:53.411]  You know, get in trouble, sued, whatever.
[00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:54.612]  But no, they tried.
[00:35:55.658 --> 00:35:59.679]  To then frame up the man who was trying to get his retarded brother out.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:01.780]  And that's what's wrong.
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:24.948]  I've seen so many squad car videos, in so many cases, of people I know, where they jerk you out of the car, they rough you up, and then, if you even touch them, when they're grabbing on you, let's say you just lean into them or you touch them with your hand, or some cases you don't even touch them, you go limp, they'll still taser you three or four times and claim you assaulted them, until videotape pops up proving it's a fraud.
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:41.066]  And I just, it's this gang mentality, and to watch this video, with all these corrupt New Orleans cops, all loving and kissing and hugging on these seven, it's gang mentality.
[00:36:41.126 --> 00:36:44.087]  Gangs support each other, no matter what.
[00:36:45.167 --> 00:36:54.451]  And when your police become gangs, biggest and oldest street gang in America, more than one mayor said that, sociologically this is a fact, you're in deep trouble.
[00:36:55.732 --> 00:37:01.473]  So, you know, it's not enough they killed this guy's brother in front of him unarmed, then they tried to frame him up and put him in prison.
[00:37:02.194 --> 00:37:04.734]  Until, I guess, good cops spoke out.
[00:37:05.794 --> 00:37:11.516]  That's like, uh, remember the New York case where they raped a guy for two hours with a toilet plunger?
[00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.036]  He was bleeding to death?
[00:37:13.976 --> 00:37:17.697]  And finally, cops blew the whistle and the cops all went after the ones that did that?
[00:37:18.237 --> 00:37:19.277]  I mean, that's weird.
[00:37:20.498 --> 00:37:21.358]  And what did the
[00:37:22.395 --> 00:37:23.376]  What did Diallo do?
[00:37:23.456 --> 00:37:23.796]  Nothing!
[00:37:23.916 --> 00:37:33.842]  They later admitted from surveillance camera tapes outside the bar that somebody else punched a cop in the back of the head, so they just grabbed the nearest person and drug him off for torture.
[00:37:35.703 --> 00:37:40.866]  Folks, it's hard to keep your anger up to beat an unarmed person, I would imagine.
[00:37:41.326 --> 00:37:50.292]  Imagine keeping your anger up... You know, a lot of times, let's say you get in a fight with somebody and they're hitting you and you hit them and you knock them out and their head hits the concrete.
[00:37:51.992 --> 00:37:55.675]  Most people, even if you've got a good killer instinct, don't start stomping their head.
[00:37:55.696 --> 00:37:59.479]  Can you imagine stomping for two hours?
[00:38:01.521 --> 00:38:04.383]  I mean, again, it shows mental illness.
[00:38:05.164 --> 00:38:10.349]  It shows a type of savagery to the extreme.
[00:38:13.131 --> 00:38:14.192]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:38:15.544 --> 00:38:18.648]  Shootings in New Orleans in the chaotic days after Katrina.
[00:38:18.688 --> 00:38:22.934]  Today, seven police officers turning themselves in to face some serious charges.
[00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:25.978]  CNN's Sean Califf's live now from New Orleans.
[00:38:26.119 --> 00:38:26.279]  Sean.
[00:38:27.932 --> 00:38:35.556]  Attorney, exactly six New Orleans police officers, one former New Orleans police officer, turned themselves in to the Sheriff's Department here in Orleans Parish.
[00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:45.340]  They are being processed right now on charges of shooting two men on a bridge on September 4th in those chaotic days right after Hurricane Katrina.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:51.463]  But the way they turned themselves in really speaks volumes about the way this case is playing out here in New Orleans.
[00:38:51.483 --> 00:38:52.524]  I want to take you to some pictures
[00:38:53.144 --> 00:39:00.530]  At least 250, perhaps as many as 300 New Orleans police officers lining the road greeting the Danziger 7, as they are now known.
[00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.532]  The shooting took place on the Danziger Bridge.
[00:39:02.932 --> 00:39:10.739]  As the seven people made their way to the Sheriff's Office, they were greeted by cheers, applause, and chants of N.O.P.D.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.841]  But what happened on that day still remains a
[00:39:15.202 --> 00:39:17.363]  Barely contested among the two sides.
[00:39:17.383 --> 00:39:21.944]  The police say that they were answering a call that an officer was down when they arrived at the bridge.
[00:39:21.984 --> 00:39:23.304]  They said there was shooting going on.
[00:39:23.585 --> 00:39:26.385]  That is when they shot and killed two people.
[00:39:27.226 --> 00:39:33.647]  The police, however, later on it was determined the indictments were handed up just this past Thursday.
[00:39:33.907 --> 00:39:39.649]  But when asked about this show of support out here on the street today, we couldn't get any of the New Orleans police officers to speak with us.
[00:39:39.889 --> 00:39:42.730]  They were all tight-lipped, but we did get an officer from another
[00:39:43.691 --> 00:39:51.546]  I'm with another department, but I'm glad to support this office because it could happen to one of us.
[00:39:51.626 --> 00:39:52.568]  It could happen to me.
[00:39:54.306 --> 00:39:57.348]  Now, four of the officers are charged with first-degree murder.
[00:39:57.408 --> 00:39:59.409]  Three are charged with attempted murder.
[00:39:59.429 --> 00:40:03.150]  They're going to be in jail here until at least Friday.
[00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:07.833]  That is when the various attorneys representing the officers say they hope to have a bond hearing.
[00:40:08.473 --> 00:40:14.396]  Now, there is a civil suit pending against the city, the officers as well involved in this shooting.
[00:40:15.149 --> 00:40:23.734]  Now, the Reverend Al Sharpton has actually said that the shooting is racially motivated, despite the fact that four of the officers involved are African American.
[00:40:24.435 --> 00:40:29.357]  When we talked to some of the attorneys involved in the case, they said they are simply dumbfounded by that accusation.
[00:40:31.459 --> 00:40:33.940]  Four of the seven officers died.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:36.702]  Reverend Sharpton can't count, or he can't count.
[00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:48.026]  Now, the two people who were killed, 19-year-old James Brissett and also Ronald Madison, who was 40.
[00:40:48.706 --> 00:40:50.687]  Ronald Madison is mentally retarded.
[00:40:51.007 --> 00:40:55.829]  His brother was arrested and charged in that incident as well.
[00:40:55.869 --> 00:40:57.470]  He was held for about 26 days.
[00:40:57.530 --> 00:40:59.951]  He is now the individual pursuing the civil charge.
[00:41:00.231 --> 00:41:02.972]  So, look, bad things happen when you've got total breakdown of society and bedlam.
[00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:30.191]  And there were being shots fired from somewhere.
[00:41:30.211 --> 00:41:33.973]  These police behaving like complete goons.
[00:41:34.193 --> 00:41:36.354]  They could have shot cops that were on the other side of the bridge.
[00:41:37.834 --> 00:41:38.674]  Should be fired.
[00:41:40.175 --> 00:41:42.776]  And they shouldn't have just sprayed a crowd of people with bullets.
[00:41:42.816 --> 00:41:43.497]  That's what happened.
[00:41:45.317 --> 00:41:46.118]  But they panicked.
[00:41:47.398 --> 00:41:50.619]  Now, they should not be being charged with first degree murder.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.101]  I mean, that means premeditated.
[00:41:55.117 --> 00:42:00.822]  Now, obviously, it's not premeditated in a passionate combat situation.
[00:42:01.843 --> 00:42:06.566]  Are they going to start charging our troops in friendly fire incidents?
[00:42:07.847 --> 00:42:11.370]  But, at the same time, they are a bunch of dirty gang members.
[00:42:11.410 --> 00:42:12.871]  You ought to go watch the video of it.
[00:42:13.472 --> 00:42:16.134]  It's like it's a carnival celebration atmosphere.
[00:42:16.815 --> 00:42:18.936]  They still behave in a shameful fashion.
[00:42:20.257 --> 00:42:24.661]  And they should be criminally charged, because I went and pulled the case up
[00:42:25.899 --> 00:42:34.224]  They tried to claim at first, when they took the brother, who just lost his brother, who was unarmed, into custody, that he was shooting at cops.
[00:42:34.644 --> 00:42:35.425]  He had no weapon.
[00:42:37.165 --> 00:42:39.567]  Then they dropped that and claimed he assaulted officers.
[00:42:40.567 --> 00:42:41.888]  I mean, you got a lot of nerve, man.
[00:42:41.908 --> 00:42:44.970]  You blew this guy's brother away, and then you try to frame him?
[00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:47.732]  That's why the cops need to go to prison.
[00:42:48.232 --> 00:42:50.033]  Whoever filed those reports,
[00:42:51.153 --> 00:42:52.574]  I mean, I've seen it.
[00:42:52.674 --> 00:42:57.238]  I've seen police and detectives and they've been caught all over the country sending innocent people to prison.
[00:42:57.678 --> 00:42:58.839]  Man, we got lives.
[00:42:58.879 --> 00:43:00.960]  We're just as good and just as important as you.
[00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:05.684]  You think we deserve to just be lied about and sent to prison?
[00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:23.355]  Remember the case in Midland, Texas, where they came in with two armored vehicles from two different sides, and the police entered on two different sides of the house, and one of them opened fire, he tripped and opened fire, so they shot one of their own cops in the back, so they went nuts and shot the unarmed man in the house, what, three times?
[00:43:24.156 --> 00:43:35.343]  And then they're talking about framing him on the tape, and then finally, one of the outside responding officers went public and said, I'm not gonna be part of this, and the reason, he said he was gonna keep quiet,
[00:43:36.491 --> 00:43:43.874]  But they were trying to frame the guy who was having a domestic disturbance with shooting their own officer and killing him, and then they wanted another.
[00:43:47.435 --> 00:43:48.335]  That's the scary part.
[00:43:48.375 --> 00:44:05.201]  These untrained, idiot SWAT teams, most of them military wash-ups, in these mid-sized towns, they got some professionals in bigger cities sometimes, they will come out to your house for whatever reason, or the wrong house, you see that every week, see the wrong house, old lady,
[00:44:06.358 --> 00:44:20.625]  And then they'll bust in your house unannounced, and they'll start shooting themselves, and then they'll... We had a case of that in Austin, where the evidence clearly shows they shot their own officer in the back entering, so they went ahead and just tried to frame the guy in the house.
[00:44:22.026 --> 00:44:24.587]  I mean, it really starts getting old.
[00:44:28.593 --> 00:44:32.156]  They look at us like we're all criminals and like we have no due process.
[00:44:32.676 --> 00:44:35.659]  And this is what television and shows like Cops have done.
[00:44:36.079 --> 00:44:38.802]  On Cops, they only show white trash or trashy people.
[00:44:39.462 --> 00:44:42.925]  Everybody's always guilty 95% of the time on the show.
[00:44:44.006 --> 00:44:46.348]  I know because I almost made a film about propaganda.
[00:44:46.388 --> 00:44:50.351]  The police state just decided it wasn't the most important thing to do and abandoned it a few years ago.
[00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:53.414]  So I was taping Cops and researching it and analyzing it.
[00:44:54.014 --> 00:44:55.275]  Somebody else ought to go with the idea.
[00:44:56.216 --> 00:44:57.397]  So I did make a study of it.
[00:44:58.084 --> 00:45:04.889]  And it shows the image of we're all a bunch of toothless, bearded, stumbling drunks who beat our wives and the cops are always good.
[00:45:05.570 --> 00:45:09.893]  And it just shows the public, and they violate people's rights on these cop shows.
[00:45:11.074 --> 00:45:15.317]  Then they got shows like 24 where they torture children or innocent people every episode.
[00:45:16.258 --> 00:45:22.863]  And then the Homeland Security even has C-SPAN broadcast bragging and thanking 24 for molding public opinion.
[00:45:22.903 --> 00:45:26.786]  I mean, we told you years ago they were molding public opinion, but now they admit they are.
[00:45:29.107 --> 00:45:30.268]  This is brainwashing!
[00:45:32.389 --> 00:45:35.810]  Statistically, historically, the most dangerous thing is government.
[00:45:36.211 --> 00:45:43.655]  Because once it goes bad, it can unabashedly be turned loose on a mass scale to engage in mass crimes.
[00:45:46.336 --> 00:45:50.198]  But in today's society, the common wisdom is, the common sense is the opposite.
[00:45:50.558 --> 00:45:56.001]  It's just trust government, let it breathe in the dark, let it do whatever it wants, and let's just all go to sleep.
[00:46:01.101 --> 00:46:02.163]  Well, I'm not going to be part of it.
[00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:06.553]  So I'm not indicting police your individual selves.
[00:46:06.693 --> 00:46:08.116]  I know most of you are good people.
[00:46:08.156 --> 00:46:08.978]  You've got a tough job.
[00:46:10.057 --> 00:46:11.098]  Frankly, I wouldn't take it.
[00:46:11.158 --> 00:46:18.485]  Thirty-something thousand dollars a year on average to hang your hind ends out on major interstate highways, riding people tickets.
[00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:20.788]  Go look at the statistics, by the way, officers.
[00:46:21.068 --> 00:46:24.771]  You're so scared to death of citizens and guns, you better be scared of car wrecks.
[00:46:24.811 --> 00:46:25.892]  That's how most of you die.
[00:46:26.193 --> 00:46:33.580]  Then next it's your own officer shooting you, and then it's citizens shooting you, or stabbing you, or running over you.
[00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:38.736]  I mean, you've got a thankless job.
[00:46:38.776 --> 00:46:41.599]  I'm not saying it's some wonderful thing.
[00:46:41.679 --> 00:46:44.841]  I'm just, would you please realize you've been brainwashed, okay?
[00:46:45.062 --> 00:46:50.406]  That's all I'm asking you to be honest with yourselves and look at what your profession has turned into.
[00:46:50.827 --> 00:46:55.030]  Always a dangerous thing to have any type of organized government force.
[00:46:55.671 --> 00:46:56.812]  It almost always goes bad.
[00:46:57.212 --> 00:46:58.353]  And it's certainly gone bad here.
[00:47:00.345 --> 00:47:03.809]  So I try to really balance things and really give you my honest opinion.
[00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:08.395]  I don't think these police should be charged with first-degree murder.
[00:47:09.336 --> 00:47:10.858]  First-degree murder.
[00:47:11.038 --> 00:47:11.318]  No.
[00:47:11.719 --> 00:47:15.704]  They didn't all get out and say, let's go out today and shoot a couple black guys.
[00:47:16.745 --> 00:47:17.906]  When four of them were black.
[00:47:18.889 --> 00:47:21.050]  Reverend Al Sharpton, what are blacks going to figure out?
[00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:28.692]  People like him, there are so many well-spoken, intelligent, focused, balanced black leaders, but they never give them a platform.
[00:47:28.732 --> 00:47:32.753]  It's always Al Sharpton who acts like a clown to make you look stupid.
[00:47:33.253 --> 00:47:45.917]  So when there is real racism, there's plenty of that going on, and in discrimination, people won't listen next time because they've heard Al Sharpton say four black cops shot two black people because they didn't like blacks.
[00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:48.318]  Just ridiculous.
[00:47:49.873 --> 00:47:54.095]  And again, it's a petty issue in the scheme of the whole world, but it's an educational microcosm.
[00:47:54.275 --> 00:47:56.096]  James in Texas, then Yvette and others.
[00:47:56.136 --> 00:47:56.696]  Go ahead, James.
[00:47:58.637 --> 00:47:59.158]  Mr. Jones.
[00:47:59.298 --> 00:47:59.598]  Yes, sir.
[00:48:00.238 --> 00:48:03.940]  First and foremost, Tergers, Pratt, Tart, sorry about the red eye.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:05.441]  Okay.
[00:48:06.681 --> 00:48:07.542]  What's on your mind, sir?
[00:48:08.082 --> 00:48:12.484]  When and if are you going to be up to par with the Howard Sterns of the world?
[00:48:13.064 --> 00:48:14.305]  Are you on satellite and all that?
[00:48:16.552 --> 00:48:27.497]  I'm on satellites to deliver radio to our affiliates, and sir, I appreciate your call, but I just don't even want to get into the edge of profanity there.
[00:48:28.237 --> 00:48:31.659]  And I appreciate your support in wanting to get me on Sirius or XM.
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:40.943]  We have approached them for years, we have had them approach us first, because you know, the vice presidents and people know this would be good, this would get them a lot of subscribers.
[00:48:43.283 --> 00:48:48.788]  I mean, both what Sirius has got like four million, XM's got like four and a half million or something.
[00:48:48.808 --> 00:48:51.530]  Last time I checked subscribers, it's losing a lot of money.
[00:48:53.993 --> 00:48:58.216]  And this network's got more listeners via AM and FM internet, shortwave satellite.
[00:48:58.657 --> 00:49:02.460]  When we subscribe to Arbitron, the network gets the numbers.
[00:49:02.901 --> 00:49:04.822]  We have more than Sirius.
[00:49:05.683 --> 00:49:07.545]  We don't have more than Sirius and XM combined.
[00:49:09.864 --> 00:49:17.769]  So certainly they would get hundreds of thousands of subscribers in a year or so if they put this show, or say all Genesis programming, on a feed.
[00:49:19.450 --> 00:49:22.232]  But that gets off into the whole radio business and how that works.
[00:49:23.012 --> 00:49:37.521]  Clear Channel, now being merged with an investment company connected to Carlisle Group, and Westwood, One, CBS, ABC, Jones, those are the four big names and glomerates.
[00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:45.351]  And they own most of the programming that you hear on Sirius and XM.
[00:49:45.592 --> 00:49:47.613]  And by the way, they're in talks to merge right now.
[00:49:49.393 --> 00:49:53.335]  The desperate bid to not bankrupt this division.
[00:49:53.996 --> 00:49:55.336]  The particular division they've launched.
[00:49:56.617 --> 00:49:57.738]  The division we're talking about.
[00:49:59.799 --> 00:50:02.500]  And we could talk for hours about radio and how it works.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:08.563]  So, it isn't just... There's an oligopoly.
[00:50:09.562 --> 00:50:13.643]  You know, stations that want to carry this show sometimes have to wait six months, a year, until their contract's up.
[00:50:14.103 --> 00:50:18.064]  Because to carry one show they want with one of these big networks, they've got to carry three or four others they don't want.
[00:50:18.084 --> 00:50:21.124]  So that's meant to monopolize stations they don't own.
[00:50:21.404 --> 00:50:24.965]  But then they still, these forking lombers, own most of the stations.
[00:50:27.285 --> 00:50:29.706]  And so, yeah, we've been contacted by them.
[00:50:29.726 --> 00:50:30.666]  Oh, we want to pick you up.
[00:50:30.746 --> 00:50:32.966]  And then higher-ups put the kibosh on it.
[00:50:34.367 --> 00:50:35.627]  So that's how that works.
[00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:39.769]  But overall it doesn't really matter.
[00:50:39.789 --> 00:50:41.510]  They're launching more satellites all the time.
[00:50:41.830 --> 00:50:45.752]  There's going to be two or three new satellites supplying.
[00:50:46.032 --> 00:50:54.477]  They're talking about the next few years just basic receivers that are a lot cheaper built into your CD player or your MP3 player being in your car.
[00:50:54.497 --> 00:51:03.882]  Or you just set your wireless internet that will be in your standard player in your car that when you pull up at your house to download it off your PC inside the podcast of this show.
[00:51:06.784 --> 00:51:08.304]  And then you gotta listen to it whenever you want.
[00:51:09.104 --> 00:51:11.645]  By the way, free podcast every day at the end of the show.
[00:51:12.145 --> 00:51:13.785]  Three hours, downloaded to you.
[00:51:13.825 --> 00:51:16.046]  Go to InfoWars.com, subscribe to it for free.

[00:52:38.644 --> 00:52:39.125]  It's here!
[00:52:39.325 --> 00:52:44.073]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:52:44.474 --> 00:52:52.127]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:52:52.805 --> 00:52:59.847]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:53:00.247 --> 00:53:11.649]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:15.490]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:17.871]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:53:18.211 --> 00:53:22.052]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:53:36.181 --> 00:53:37.162]  Good morning, honey.
[00:53:37.523 --> 00:53:43.530]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation.
[00:53:43.810 --> 00:53:44.431]  Yeah.
[00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:46.213]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:53:46.573 --> 00:53:49.998]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[00:53:50.458 --> 00:53:51.940]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.102]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:53:54.483 --> 00:53:56.245]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:53:56.425 --> 00:53:57.366]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:53:57.706 --> 00:53:59.987]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:54:00.227 --> 00:54:00.567]  What?

[00:54:11.753 --> 00:54:13.954]  You know, this is a terrific cabin!

[00:54:16.915 --> 00:54:18.116]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:54:40.633 --> 00:54:42.835]  This song is dedicated to Paul Watson.
[00:54:45.055 --> 00:54:50.239]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:54:50.559 --> 00:54:55.623]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:54:55.984 --> 00:54:58.465]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:54:58.706 --> 00:55:01.107]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:55:01.408 --> 00:55:03.890]  We fired once more and they'd forget the running.
[00:55:04.170 --> 00:55:06.391]  On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:55:09.333 --> 00:55:30.864]  We looked down the river and we see the British come And there must have been a hundred of them beatin' on the drums They stepped so high and they made the bugles ring We stood beside our cotton fields and didn't say a thing We fired our guns and the British kept a-comin' There wasn't as many as there was a while ago We fired once more and they began to runnin' On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[00:55:33.849 --> 00:55:35.870]  I've been meaning to, to, to plug
[00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:12.697]  The fact that we have a free podcast and tens of thousands of people, yes tens of thousands, are taking advantage of it and I want tens of thousands more.
[00:56:13.257 --> 00:56:17.401]  Just tell your whole email list, tell your message board, tell your web space, tell everybody.
[00:56:17.781 --> 00:56:18.942]  I'm asking everybody out there.
[00:56:19.783 --> 00:56:20.643]  We're paying for it.
[00:56:21.424 --> 00:56:26.208]  I just want to fight the New World Order and we can circumvent the censors and all the rest of them.
[00:56:26.788 --> 00:56:27.429]  It's free.
[00:56:27.649 --> 00:56:29.851]  Listen to it how you want, when you want, where you want.
[00:56:31.235 --> 00:56:46.123]  And if you want to finance our little operation, why don't you go buy some of the DVDs and books and videos I've made, I've written, that we carry, up on InfoWars.com, or PrisonPlanet.com, or call toll free to get my films, 888-253-3139.
[00:56:46.143 --> 00:56:50.445]  Let's go ahead and talk to Yvette in New Jersey.
[00:56:50.485 --> 00:56:51.365]  Yvette, thanks for holding.
[00:56:52.106 --> 00:56:54.427]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[00:56:54.487 --> 00:56:55.568]  Yeah, 2007, we made it this far.
[00:56:55.728 --> 00:56:57.028]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:56:57.429 --> 00:57:00.030]  Well, I have three quick questions to ask you.
[00:57:00.458 --> 00:57:03.380]  Do you know when they're going to be voting on the hate crime bill?
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:05.061]  Because I really would like to contact them.
[00:57:05.081 --> 00:57:06.842]  That could be as early as next week.
[00:57:07.262 --> 00:57:07.962]  Next week?
[00:57:08.262 --> 00:57:10.864]  Yeah, we barely beat it last year in the last session.
[00:57:11.284 --> 00:57:12.445]  Now the Democrats are there.
[00:57:12.585 --> 00:57:13.705]  Bush says he'll sign it.
[00:57:14.326 --> 00:57:18.488]  And oh, by the way, they have a new hate bill that they've been introducing every year.
[00:57:18.528 --> 00:57:20.429]  Nadler, but now it looks like Nadler can get it passed.
[00:57:20.889 --> 00:57:24.490]  Where if you just say anything that hurts someone's feelings, it's criminal.
[00:57:24.850 --> 00:57:30.612]  There's a federal law for our public schools to get our children into the system, and now I'm getting emails that I'm a hater.
[00:57:31.292 --> 00:57:33.772]  No, I'm for the First Amendment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:34.393 --> 00:57:35.713]  And, yeah, we're in a lot of trouble.
[00:57:36.193 --> 00:57:37.193]  Oh, man, okay.
[00:57:37.213 --> 00:57:39.954]  Well, I'm definitely going to contact my representatives about it.
[00:57:40.746 --> 00:57:48.370]  Also, near the end of last year, you had a gentleman on your show named Aaron Russo, and referring to the New World Order, the North American Union.
[00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:53.013]  He said we could talk all day about the problem, but what we need to do is formulate an action plan.
[00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:54.854]  I've been trying to get Aaron on again.
[00:57:54.874 --> 00:57:56.375]  I don't want to say too much.
[00:57:56.715 --> 00:58:00.197]  He's not feeling too well, and I'll leave it at that.
[00:58:00.277 --> 00:58:02.699]  But he's getting better, and we should have him on soon.
[00:58:03.319 --> 00:58:04.800]  You want to get down to Brasstacks.
[00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:08.162]  I'm scheduled to actually face-to-face interview him.
[00:58:09.557 --> 00:58:11.478]  Uh, in the next few days, I'll just leave it at that.
[00:58:11.918 --> 00:58:13.840]  Okay, I hope he feels better.
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:18.123]  Um, the last- A lot of times everybody goes to InfoWars.com and buys his great film.
[00:58:18.404 --> 00:58:18.744]  Oh, it's great.
[00:58:18.764 --> 00:58:21.046]  American Freedom from Fascism, his work is very important.
[00:58:21.326 --> 00:58:22.287]  Yeah, it's very good.
[00:58:22.307 --> 00:58:32.735]  Um, say you went to a shelter, this is my last question, say you went to a shelter and you fell in love with a cat, and you decided to adopt it, but then you found out the cat has a microchip in it.
[00:58:33.231 --> 00:58:35.832]  Is there a procedure to get the microchip out of the cat?
[00:58:35.872 --> 00:58:38.694]  Well, look, the microchip itself isn't some evil thing.
[00:58:38.754 --> 00:58:44.957]  It's that they want to use it to track humans, an RFID to track all the products, and that's the real evil.
[00:58:45.617 --> 00:58:52.720]  But if you like the cat, I mean, I'm sure... I don't think you'd be able to get a vet to take the chip out because they'd say it wasn't needed as a procedure.
[00:58:54.001 --> 00:58:58.443]  They've tried to pass laws and have in many states and cities that if you want to adopt, it has to have a chip.
[00:58:58.963 --> 00:59:01.985]  Now we're passing laws that all animals have to have chips, and that is wrong.
[00:59:02.617 --> 00:59:03.198]  Yeah.
[00:59:03.658 --> 00:59:08.124]  Well, I think if you want the little kitty cat, you know, do what you want there.
[00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:09.746]  I don't think it'll be some great blast for me.
[00:59:10.246 --> 00:59:11.788]  The technology itself isn't evil.
[00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:12.869]  It's how it's being implemented.
[00:59:13.089 --> 00:59:13.770]  We'll be right back.

[00:59:27.461 --> 00:59:28.502]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:59:28.823 --> 00:59:31.607]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:59:31.887 --> 00:59:36.033]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:59:36.473 --> 00:59:37.294]  So what do you do?
[00:59:37.615 --> 00:59:42.181]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:59:42.661 --> 00:59:44.803]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:59:45.284 --> 00:59:46.185]  Sheltering in place.
[00:59:46.565 --> 00:59:50.289]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:59:50.609 --> 00:59:57.877]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, gives you...
[00:59:58.437 --> 01:00:04.421]  Easy to follow video instructions and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:00:37.325 --> 01:00:37.985]  Big Brother.
[01:00:38.626 --> 01:00:39.706]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:40.407 --> 01:00:41.527]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:42.168 --> 01:00:42.988]  You want answers?
[01:00:43.749 --> 01:00:44.669]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:49.052]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:49.472 --> 01:00:53.575]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:54.415 --> 01:00:58.839]  Now into hour number two on this third day of January 2007.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:02.683]  I'm just now starting to get used to that.
[01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:07.327]  For, by the time I get accustomed, it'll be 2008.
[01:01:22.672 --> 01:01:30.395]  Let's go back to your calls, and then I'm going to get into Israel saying they may go ahead, their top think tank has advised them in the past saying they can go ahead and go it alone with Iran.
[01:01:31.215 --> 01:01:31.956]  What Bush Sr.
[01:01:31.976 --> 01:01:38.358]  said yesterday confirmed about the JFK assassination, some other key audio clips, and three different guests coming up.
[01:01:38.378 --> 01:01:45.441]  We're going to give you an update from the FEMA camp north of Austin with the men that were there yesterday, Aaron Dykes and Kevin Smith.
[01:01:45.901 --> 01:01:48.242]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Joe.
[01:01:48.262 --> 01:01:50.443]  Joe, where are you calling me from today?
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.081]  Hey Alex, I'm up in Pittsburgh.
[01:01:53.561 --> 01:01:54.301]  Pittsburgh!
[01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:56.002]  Alright, what's going on my stealer?
[01:01:56.962 --> 01:02:02.785]  Well, my man, I actually called you on Friday for your last 2006 broadcast.
[01:02:03.385 --> 01:02:03.805]  Yes.
[01:02:05.065 --> 01:02:06.986]  And I thought we had a good little talk.
[01:02:07.486 --> 01:02:13.869]  However, after we hung up, I think I was a little bit misconstrued by the caller after me.
[01:02:13.909 --> 01:02:15.069]  Well, I don't remember.
[01:02:15.129 --> 01:02:16.510]  Refresh my feeble memory.
[01:02:17.409 --> 01:02:24.633]  Well, he said his name was Dino from Oregon, and I had mentioned in my call that... Oh, I remember now.
[01:02:24.853 --> 01:02:26.113]  I mean, I defended you.
[01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:40.781]  I just think Dino was mad about the state of events, and you were saying you're a musician, you want to have some events up in Pittsburgh on 9-11, you'd like to have me up there, and then he kind of said something a little nasty.
[01:02:41.832 --> 01:02:43.173]  But I think that was just the mood.
[01:02:43.393 --> 01:02:47.336]  I don't think I was construing you trying to... No, not you, him.
[01:02:47.356 --> 01:02:52.100]  Don't worry, I'm sure Dino will call in now.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:54.562]  Yeah, well, thanks for defending me.
[01:02:55.422 --> 01:02:58.765]  Dino mentioned that he was listening to your show for six years.
[01:02:58.805 --> 01:03:03.248]  I've only been listening to your show for six months and I'm trying to put something together to get people informed.
[01:03:03.809 --> 01:03:05.150]  I just had a quick question for him.
[01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:08.932]  If he does call in, what has he done to try to help the movement?
[01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:12.995]  That's secondary to the reason why I called again.
[01:03:13.895 --> 01:03:18.036]  I became a gun owner on Friday for the first time.
[01:03:18.816 --> 01:03:23.998]  After we spoke on the phone, we went to the gun store, my girlfriend and I, and bought ourselves a shotgun here.
[01:03:24.398 --> 01:03:24.758]  Good!
[01:03:24.778 --> 01:03:26.458]  To protect our home front.
[01:03:27.799 --> 01:03:29.499]  Have you ever fired a firearm before?
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:33.820]  Yeah, I've fired firearms in the past a few times.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:39.302]  Well, it's totally worth it to talk to a local shooting range and ask who their best
[01:03:40.126 --> 01:03:54.050]  Their best teacher is, and you may have to go out to a skeet range if it's a shotgun, but I'd take a couple of lessons and then I'd go out and practice yourself, because it's a, you know, with great power comes great responsibility, as Spider-Man's uncle says.
[01:03:54.730 --> 01:03:55.330]  Exactly.
[01:03:57.551 --> 01:04:02.252]  Because I advise everybody to buy firearms, but stow them properly and learn how to use them.
[01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:07.394]  And I've been shooting since I'm knee-high to a grasshopper, and I still get out amongst people who are
[01:04:08.334 --> 01:04:12.258]  Veterans and really good with guns, and they still don't follow proper procedures.
[01:04:12.838 --> 01:04:17.643]  And so I don't want to get people killed out there, but I do think everybody needs guns, but just be careful with them.
[01:04:19.304 --> 01:04:19.805]  Exactly.
[01:04:20.405 --> 01:04:29.974]  Just one more thing I wanted to add also was that I think the whole truth movement, as I call it, is kind of, I don't know, disorganized.
[01:04:30.314 --> 01:04:32.777]  But in a way that's good.
[01:04:35.783 --> 01:04:48.554]  Everybody's always saying we've got to be organized, we've got to be organized, and I think we need organizing thoughts and organizing manifesto, you know, organized music, a sheet of music we're playing off of here.
[01:04:49.655 --> 01:04:56.561]  But I really think it makes us unstoppable that we're roving wolf packs here, lone wolves.
[01:04:57.281 --> 01:04:59.223]  That really makes us hard to penetrate and stop.
[01:05:00.253 --> 01:05:07.755]  I'd like to try to send you at least a clip from a song that my girlfriend and I, we've been writing some new songs here.
[01:05:07.775 --> 01:05:08.276]  Stay there.
[01:05:08.296 --> 01:05:09.596]  We'll let you finish up.
[01:05:09.636 --> 01:05:13.958]  We'll talk about Consolidated Resistance versus Wolfpacks.
[01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:18.179]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:05:18.219 --> 01:05:20.620]  It is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:25.781]  This is Wolfpack Leader Jones from FEMA Sector 10.
[01:05:25.861 --> 01:05:27.462]  We'll be right back.
[01:05:35.914 --> 01:05:39.077]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:41.340]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:49.388]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:50.054 --> 01:05:57.098]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:57.518 --> 01:06:08.905]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:12.767]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:06:13.227 --> 01:06:15.148]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:06:15.489 --> 01:06:19.251]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:32.469 --> 01:07:33.049]  It's a fact.
[01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:37.670]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:07:38.130 --> 01:07:43.311]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:07:43.612 --> 01:07:46.812]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:07:47.072 --> 01:07:54.174]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:07:54.534 --> 01:08:01.741]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:08:02.162 --> 01:08:04.003]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:08:04.464 --> 01:08:12.872]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt instead of living each day in fear.
[01:08:13.232 --> 01:08:14.814]  It's time to turn your life around.
[01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:17.716]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.

[01:08:19.878 --> 01:08:20.959]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[01:08:20.979 --> 01:08:22.480]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:08:37.592 --> 01:08:41.756]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:08:42.417 --> 01:08:43.257]  You want answers?
[01:08:44.018 --> 01:08:44.839]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:45.559 --> 01:08:49.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:49.743 --> 01:08:53.867]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:09:05.157 --> 01:09:08.280]  I'm going to go back to Joe in Pittsburgh in a minute.
[01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:14.467]  He was talking about organizing versus not being organized against the New World Order.
[01:09:15.542 --> 01:09:22.844]  And it's a very complex issue and I've really studied it and I want to try to spend a few minutes laying that out and we'll go to Chris and John and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:09:23.264 --> 01:09:30.205]  Coming up in about 25 minutes we've got Kevin Smith and Aaron Dykes here in studio to talk about the FEMA camp north of Austin and Taylor they visited yesterday.
[01:09:30.865 --> 01:09:37.827]  We were up here until about one in the morning last night working on that report in between working on the new film to be putting that out for free.
[01:09:37.867 --> 01:09:41.727]  A lot of our reports we put out for free on Google Video but about half of them aren't free.
[01:09:41.747 --> 01:09:44.208]  We put them up on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:09:45.608 --> 01:09:49.250]  Let's go ahead, though, and go to a surprise call.
[01:09:49.330 --> 01:10:07.919]  Jack McClam, who's here on the Genesis Network every night at 7 o'clock Central, most highly decorated police officer in Phoenix, Arizona history, cop of the year twice, I guess, and also a Vietnam vet of that era, great patriot, head of the police and military against the New World Order for 25 years.
[01:10:08.439 --> 01:10:11.961]  He put out the Vampire Killer 2000 document that's woken up millions of police.
[01:10:12.921 --> 01:10:13.521]  Over the years.
[01:10:13.561 --> 01:10:15.222]  Let's go to Jack McClam.
[01:10:15.562 --> 01:10:28.407]  Jack, you wanted to comment on my discussion last hour of the New Orleans police that shot two innocent people, killed them, and then tried to frame some of the other innocent people they'd been shooting at.
[01:10:28.867 --> 01:10:31.428]  And I have no idea what your take is on it, but I'd like to get it.
[01:10:31.468 --> 01:10:32.068]  Welcome, Jack.
[01:10:32.509 --> 01:10:33.589]  Yes, thank you, brother.
[01:10:33.649 --> 01:10:34.789]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:10:35.490 --> 01:10:36.550]  Happy New Year to you.
[01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:37.770]  You bet.
[01:10:38.231 --> 01:10:41.532]  Yes, here about six months ago,
[01:10:42.966 --> 01:11:02.076]  Our Police and Military Association put out a publication that showed 12 ways in which judges and prosecutors, both government agents today, manipulate the jury's minds to come out with a jury decision that they wish to come out with.
[01:11:02.296 --> 01:11:11.561]  And what we've found over the years as we've attended literally hundreds of thousands of trials, is that when the government
[01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:15.992]  Has a friend or an associate on trial.
[01:11:16.872 --> 01:11:29.458]  Many times the judge will allow the prosecution to come in with a charge that is totally unsubstantiated.
[01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:30.939]  In other words, they can't prove it.
[01:11:32.120 --> 01:11:34.561]  Like first degree murder in this case.
[01:11:35.436 --> 01:11:41.079]  And then the judge will not allow the jury to accept a lower charge.
[01:11:41.299 --> 01:11:49.183]  If the jury finds out these people can't be convicted of first degree murder, then the judge just lets them off.
[01:11:50.725 --> 01:11:56.409]  The judge will not allow the jury to come in with second-degree murder or manslaughter or something like that.
[01:11:56.429 --> 01:12:03.874]  So it's a way to, with massive attention, to make it look like the state was trying to hit them hard, but in truth, clearly it's not premeditated murder.
[01:12:03.914 --> 01:12:05.355]  It's a crime of passion.
[01:12:06.355 --> 01:12:09.497]  Manslaughter, negligent homicide, you know, one of those two.
[01:12:09.517 --> 01:12:11.419]  You can give me your take on which one you think it is.
[01:12:12.059 --> 01:12:13.980]  And that's a really good point, Jack.
[01:12:14.321 --> 01:12:19.464]  Yeah, and we've seen this happen over and over again, but in most cases where it'd be
[01:12:20.402 --> 01:12:35.908]  A citizen on trial, the judge will allow the jury to come back with a lesser charge, a finding of a lesser guilty verdict on somebody, but... What do you think of the case itself and how they tried to frame people they've been shooting at for no reason?
[01:12:37.869 --> 01:12:48.873]  Well, it just sounds like it's the classic case where they're going to let these officers off, is what it sounds like, and so they're muddying the water
[01:12:49.557 --> 01:12:57.280]  With all of these other charges and trying to manipulate the jury before the jury is even in the jury pool.
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:12:58.160]  You know what I mean?
[01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:13.487]  The jury reads the newspaper or the people that are going to be on the jury that don't even know they're going to be on the jury and they start reading all these things and then they pick the jury and the jury is confused and misdirected many times.
[01:13:14.047 --> 01:13:16.948]  And it sounds like this is a classic case of misdirection.
[01:13:17.999 --> 01:13:21.101]  For the jury members and for the public.
[01:13:22.442 --> 01:13:27.106]  Well, from the evidence of the case, they don't contest, they just open fire on a crowd of people.
[01:13:27.526 --> 01:13:27.946]  Right.
[01:13:27.986 --> 01:13:29.467]  What charge do you think there should be?
[01:13:30.768 --> 01:13:39.814]  Well, I don't know all the evidence going to be presented, but it sounds like a good case for second degree murder, is what it sounds like.
[01:13:40.275 --> 01:13:46.279]  You know, if they just open fire on a group of people out there, unless
[01:13:47.168 --> 01:14:02.853]  We find in the evidence, true evidence that is, because a lot of times they manufacture evidence, the government does, and manufacture witnesses, destroy evidence and destroy witnesses, you know, don't let witnesses on to testify.
[01:14:03.534 --> 01:14:07.055]  We find this in many of these government cases.
[01:14:07.575 --> 01:14:10.576]  But if it is true that they just opened fire,
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:17.783]  On a group of citizens out there, a second-degree murder would be a good charge to go with on this case.
[01:14:19.184 --> 01:14:31.109]  Jack McClam, they admit that they tried to basically charge some of the people that had done nothing, I guess as a way to suppress them and keep them from suing or speaking out.
[01:14:32.430 --> 01:14:35.351]  To me, that is the big premeditated crime right there.
[01:14:36.052 --> 01:14:40.854]  Yeah, many times, as you know, Alex, whenever you have
[01:14:41.673 --> 01:14:45.915]  This happened in the city of Phoenix when I was a police investigator there.
[01:14:46.435 --> 01:14:52.397]  Whenever somebody has a good case to sue the city, the city will charge them with something.
[01:14:53.017 --> 01:15:00.920]  And then they'll do a king's act, you know, you drop your charges, we'll drop your, you know, if you're not going to sue the city, then we'll drop our charges against you.
[01:15:01.981 --> 01:15:10.804]  And so, you never know Alex, the games are playing, but we would ask the public before they stand and go in for jury duty,
[01:15:11.365 --> 01:15:31.604]  To get a copy of our Ain't About Police Military Newsletter we put out specifically for prospective jurors to read these 12 ways in which the judge and the prosecutor will secretly manipulate their minds without them knowing about it to come out with the jury decision the government wants in these cases.
[01:15:31.664 --> 01:15:34.487]  Everybody ought to read that so that they
[01:15:35.017 --> 01:15:38.340]  And then, before they go for jury duty, pull it down and read it again.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:58.899]  Well, many Americans think that we've had our right to vote taken away because of these fraudulent machines, but we still have the grand jury box and the jury box, which are also forms of a pure vote, and all the jurisprudence, all the precedents, the founding father stated, it is a veto, the people's veto, against bad law and bad corrupt systems.
[01:15:58.959 --> 01:16:00.741]  And so even if it's, quote, the law,
[01:16:01.642 --> 01:16:10.027]  Let's say that a black man wasn't allowed to, say, when he was a slave, take a hickory stick away from somebody beating him and beat his master to death.
[01:16:10.628 --> 01:16:14.190]  And, you know, the jury thinks that this person really should be allowed to go free.
[01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:18.692]  The jury can say, well, according to the law may say he's a slave, but we say he's going free.
[01:16:19.073 --> 01:16:20.974]  That happened during the first years of abolition.
[01:16:21.254 --> 01:16:21.454]  Sure.
[01:16:21.574 --> 01:16:34.897]  And then of course there's the famous cases that people then put into fiction books like A Time to Kill, like somebody rapes and kills somebody's little daughter, or beats them, and then the father goes and blows them away, and the jury says, we don't care, he walks.
[01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:36.737]  That's what the jury's supposed to do.
[01:16:39.438 --> 01:16:50.300]  It is, but Alex, say if the people knew of these twelve ways, and there's other ways too, in which the government agent judge and the government agent prosecutor
[01:16:51.010 --> 01:17:08.433]  Conspired together without the knowledge covertly without the knowledge of the jurors to manipulate their minds They would be a much better juror going into these cases and so we request all Americans to read this a Nibbett police military newsletter and
[01:17:08.963 --> 01:17:15.628]  On empowering the jury to know when the judge and the prosecutor have formed a conspiracy against the jury.
[01:17:15.648 --> 01:17:18.730]  Now, can folks go to JackMcLamb.com or do they need to write to you to get that?
[01:17:18.911 --> 01:17:19.951]  Yeah, that would be fine.
[01:17:19.991 --> 01:17:23.934]  Just www.jackmclamb.com.
[01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:25.676]  Does that have your jury paper on it?
[01:17:26.056 --> 01:17:26.836]  It does, yes.
[01:17:27.257 --> 01:17:28.818]  Well, they can just call that number.
[01:17:30.868 --> 01:17:42.676]  There, or right to the address, and we request, because we're an all-volunteer police and military association, that they put three bucks in an envelope to help us pay for the postage and pay for the printing cost.
[01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:49.900]  Well, that's important, Jack, that people get a copy of it, but I would also just throw it up on the web.
[01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:55.904]  I think something that important, because I've heard you do shows on it, and I've read some of your past material that I agree with.
[01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:57.525]  Let us do this, Alex.
[01:17:57.585 --> 01:17:59.226]  Let us send you out a copy of it.
[01:17:59.981 --> 01:18:01.802]  And you'll see how powerful it is.
[01:18:01.902 --> 01:18:23.818]  If every juror, or prospective juror, before they went into vort dire, would read that newsletter, they would be ready for anything the prosecutor and judge are going to concoct to try to get their friends off in a case, or to convict somebody that is a political prisoner, as we have so many today, political prisoners.
[01:18:25.019 --> 01:18:28.361]  They won't be likely to go along with the manipulation
[01:18:29.028 --> 01:18:31.949]  Psychological manipulation of the judge and the prosecutor.
[01:18:31.969 --> 01:18:37.390]  Let us send you a copy of that, Alex, and you look at it and you'll see what we mean.
[01:18:37.930 --> 01:18:48.473]  I've interviewed Red Beckman and many others, the father of the fully formed jury association movement, but I've heard your analysis of it and all the tricks that you've learned through using.
[01:18:48.893 --> 01:18:49.813]  So that's great, Jack.
[01:18:49.873 --> 01:18:50.753]  Thank you for coming on.
[01:18:50.813 --> 01:18:52.254]  I need to get you on as a guest soon.
[01:18:52.654 --> 01:18:53.274]  Okay, brother.
[01:18:53.494 --> 01:18:53.774]  Sounds good.
[01:18:53.834 --> 01:18:54.515]  We're good.
[01:18:54.955 --> 01:18:57.357]  How are things going up there in the Great Rocky Mountains?
[01:18:57.597 --> 01:18:59.638]  Hey, things are going very well.
[01:18:59.879 --> 01:19:13.889]  We're having meetings again here for the citizens in the county and they're going very, very well as we're trying to stave off the National ID and all these things that the county can actually stop.
[01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:17.152]  Our county leadership can actually stop these things.
[01:19:17.882 --> 01:19:22.384]  Even if the state goes along with it, and so we're happy to have our meeting started up again.
[01:19:22.404 --> 01:19:36.469]  In the last minute we've got left, I think it's important that we stay in different groups and different organizations and different tactics, but read from the same sheet of music, the Constitution, because that makes it harder to penetrate or control.
[01:19:36.929 --> 01:19:40.251]  Do you agree with my analysis on the lone wolf mode?
[01:19:40.991 --> 01:19:41.811]  I do, brother.
[01:19:41.851 --> 01:19:46.353]  It's so important that we stay in our small groups because for years and years,
[01:19:47.239 --> 01:19:54.887]  Government snitches and agents have been trying to convince us to all come together in one big group in America, and that's the worst thing you could do.
[01:19:55.488 --> 01:20:02.575]  Because it's so easy to penetrate so many groups that this has been done to over the years that we know of.
[01:20:03.396 --> 01:20:05.679]  And so, no, don't come together in one group.
[01:20:05.699 --> 01:20:06.640]  Stay independent.
[01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:19.655]  And by that, you still go to big meetings, you're still part of bigger groups, but it's just, when you've only got a few big groups, it's easy for them to take control of them, manipulate them, demonize them, but they can't stop just a general movement of liberty and freedom.
[01:20:20.156 --> 01:20:23.197]  Alright, Jack McClain, I appreciate you calling in.
[01:20:23.357 --> 01:20:23.938]  Thank you, brother.
[01:20:24.378 --> 01:20:25.218]  Good to hear from you.
[01:20:25.919 --> 01:20:32.482]  Yeah, watch these people, and I know it's instinctive to want a leader, but watch these people that, you know, say, we need to be the leader.
[01:20:33.297 --> 01:20:38.260]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[01:21:37.355 --> 01:21:43.197]  Did you know that the United Nations' basic philosophy is both anti-American and pro-dictatorship?
[01:21:43.878 --> 01:21:53.142]  Did you know that the United Nations was founded by Communist and Marxist members of the Council on Foreign Relations, whose goal is a socialistic one-world government?

[01:22:38.949 --> 01:22:43.772]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum, and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:22:43.972 --> 01:22:46.714]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:22:46.754 --> 01:22:47.855]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:22:49.216 --> 01:22:53.819]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:23:01.945]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:23:02.998 --> 01:23:06.381]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.

[01:23:32.429 --> 01:23:34.771]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:23:35.031 --> 01:23:37.052]  What was the last time you used pure soap?

[01:24:48.874 --> 01:25:08.959]  Alright, let's try to hurry through your calls, because I've got Kevin and Aaron who were up there at the FEMA camp yesterday to be in studio to tell you some of the other things they witnessed after the show ended.
[01:25:09.839 --> 01:25:11.480]  They're in Taylor, Texas, north of Austin.
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:16.181]  I've got a bunch of global news to cover, several other big audio clips I want to play, and two guests in the next hour.
[01:25:17.281 --> 01:25:21.443]  Joe, in Pittsburgh, you were asking about, you know, everybody coming together.
[01:25:21.944 --> 01:25:28.247]  And it seems like, you know, at a primitive level, let's all get together, let's go wage war on the enemy, let's have one group, one organization.
[01:25:28.687 --> 01:25:37.811]  Then they can infiltrate, they can have people infiltrate the group, you know, get caught with drugs, or get caught with other bad things, or they can just demonize, you know, the name of the group.
[01:25:38.151 --> 01:25:45.695]  But if you're just a movement of freedom, and by that, people coming together, but starting lots of Second Amendment groups, or border control groups,
[01:25:46.517 --> 01:26:03.628]  uh... or land rights organizations are anti-globalist organizations uh... getting elected city council getting elected on the school board just holding back big government it's it's it's it's basically a constitutionalist philosophy that's that's really the key here
[01:26:04.272 --> 01:26:15.536]  You know, and I'm not saying your question was motivated by ill or bad, but so many others have come up to the ranks and demanded, Jones, you must merge with us and fight the New World Order!
[01:26:16.296 --> 01:26:24.939]  And really, so many times that's just an attempt for egomaniacs to gain control of a movement, or they're just misguided or they're feds.
[01:26:25.619 --> 01:26:28.600]  But you wanted to say something about music, and then I've got to let you go.
[01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:34.331]  Well, first of all, I do agree with you of what you're just saying there.
[01:26:35.558 --> 01:26:45.362]  I meant disorganized in that not all of the groups that say they're for the truth movement are, you know, going by the sheet music of the Constitution, so to speak.
[01:26:45.682 --> 01:26:46.742]  Well, that's what I've tried to do.
[01:26:46.842 --> 01:26:52.644]  I've tried to make this broadcast not about infighting and egomania like most other patron networks and talk show hosts.
[01:26:53.105 --> 01:27:01.888]  I've tried to make it about moving forward and having an effect, and we've done that to a great extent, and so have other organizations that are doing a good job, and so that's what's happening.
[01:27:03.209 --> 01:27:11.571]  And the thing about music is, I think music is one of the most beautiful and inspiring things that a human being can be a part of and create.
[01:27:12.411 --> 01:27:15.732]  And I think that is a good way for people to come together.
[01:27:16.632 --> 01:27:24.694]  A lot of people are creating anti-New World Order music, from hip-hop to classical to you name it, and I appreciate your call.
[01:27:25.055 --> 01:27:26.795]  Send me the music you put together with your wife.
[01:27:26.835 --> 01:27:27.475]  I'd like to hear it.
[01:27:27.975 --> 01:27:29.396]  Let's talk to Chris in Florida.
[01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:30.116]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:27:30.176 --> 01:27:30.776]  Thanks for holding.
[01:27:32.733 --> 01:27:33.814]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:34.074 --> 01:27:57.111]  Last week, on Tuesday or Wednesday, I heard on my local Rush Limbaugh radio station, I don't normally tune in to Rush Limbaugh, I heard in the morning, where they give about 2-3 minutes of Rush's commentary, and they have Rush giving an explanation of what Kevin Barrett was doing, Professor Barrett.
[01:27:58.052 --> 01:28:00.534]  He claimed that, just as O'Reilly has claimed,
[01:28:01.335 --> 01:28:05.920]  Kevin Barrett is forcing his students to buy his book on 9-11.
[01:28:06.861 --> 01:28:07.581]  Have you heard about that?
[01:28:07.841 --> 01:28:23.716]  That's not true, and I've had Rainbow attack me as the evil leader of 9-11 Truth, who's, you know, I'm just out to destroy America, and I'm so evil, and I mean, look, these guys are dinosaurs, they're losing their audiences, they're losing their credibility.
[01:28:24.177 --> 01:28:26.339]  Real conservatives are seeing right through them.
[01:28:27.057 --> 01:28:28.317]  Integrate.
[01:28:28.357 --> 01:28:29.037]  Integrate.
[01:28:29.578 --> 01:28:35.499]  I just wanted to encourage people to expose Limbaugh and discredit him whenever they get the chance.
[01:28:36.799 --> 01:28:41.820]  And a tip, I wanted to ask your advice on calling into talk shows and to discredit them.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:56.083]  What do you think about the idea of when a caller calls in to a host who's basically promoting war, trying to trick us into a war through lies and half-truths, or trying to trick us
[01:28:57.485 --> 01:29:05.751]  You know, and to doing something unhealthy, for example, you know, say they're against vitamin C, they say you don't need it when it's an essential nutrient.
[01:29:05.871 --> 01:29:07.292]  People like Dr. Dandell, yeah.
[01:29:07.772 --> 01:29:09.473]  Yeah, think like foot doctor.
[01:29:10.454 --> 01:29:18.359]  But what do you think about letting the talk show host know exactly, or let the sponsors of the talk show host know,
[01:29:19.805 --> 01:29:21.086]  Why you won't patronize them?
[01:29:21.426 --> 01:29:24.387]  Exactly what lies that these talk show hosts are telling.
[01:29:24.748 --> 01:29:32.812]  Write them down, call up the sponsors, or write them and let them know that you will not patronize them because of the hosts that they're... Well, it's a free country.
[01:29:32.832 --> 01:29:34.112]  You can do that if you want to.
[01:29:34.212 --> 01:29:46.959]  You know, I think it's... The key is not so much even paying attention to those people, but just promoting alternative media that you found to be accurate, that you respect, that you think is valuable and valid,
[01:29:48.468 --> 01:30:00.494]  I think that's really more important than attacking them, because in the final equation, just attacking them isn't as effective as promoting the truth.
[01:30:01.545 --> 01:30:15.153]  Well, in the end, the effect is sometimes I've had callers after me who seem to have agreed with the host, but right after the host is forced to dump me, then, you know, I find that the next caller is a little bit shaky in his support for the host.
[01:30:15.334 --> 01:30:16.454]  Yes, we'll be right back.
[01:30:16.514 --> 01:30:17.175]  Thanks for the call.
[01:30:17.715 --> 01:30:21.958]  I'll comment on tactics you use on these people when we get back.
[01:30:23.439 --> 01:30:24.359]  We're on the march.
[01:30:24.379 --> 01:30:26.521]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:30.043]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:33.542 --> 01:30:37.506]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:30:37.726 --> 01:30:41.269]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:30:41.549 --> 01:30:45.633]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:30:45.933 --> 01:30:46.874]  I was so amazed.
[01:30:47.114 --> 01:30:49.937]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:30:50.137 --> 01:30:51.999]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:30:52.379 --> 01:30:57.644]  SoleilWellness.com is a unique company that offers Salt Wellness products from around the world.
[01:30:58.065 --> 01:31:03.970]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:05.952]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:31:06.212 --> 01:31:09.415]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:31:09.596 --> 01:31:13.499]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:31:13.759 --> 01:31:15.221]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:31:15.561 --> 01:31:20.686]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit SoleilWellness.com.

[01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:26.270]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[01:31:26.370 --> 01:31:27.311]  The real money folks.
[01:31:41.649 --> 01:31:43.550]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:45.050]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:46.510]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.970]  A 5% increase.
[01:31:47.571 --> 01:31:50.351]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the Euro.
[01:31:50.371 --> 01:31:53.692]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[01:31:53.712 --> 01:31:55.252]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:31:55.272 --> 01:31:56.212]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:32:09.136 --> 01:32:12.138]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:32:12.718 --> 01:32:17.861]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:32:19.181 --> 01:32:23.104]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[01:32:23.784 --> 01:32:26.706]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:28.547]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:32:33.527 --> 01:32:34.408]  It's no secret.
[01:32:34.648 --> 01:32:40.172]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[01:32:40.332 --> 01:32:45.136]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[01:32:45.436 --> 01:32:47.738]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[01:32:47.918 --> 01:32:50.360]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:58.930]  Nobio eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[01:32:59.090 --> 01:33:03.536]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Nobio.
[01:33:03.636 --> 01:33:05.538]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil,
[01:33:05.558 --> 01:33:06.118]  I think so.
[01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:56.173]  From Nazareth he came with a ragtag band to bring a revolution.
[01:33:57.414 --> 01:34:04.218]  Some would make him king, others couldn't stand the band.
[01:34:04.498 --> 01:34:10.542]  The cost was a solution, but he rose again.
[01:34:12.290 --> 01:34:16.754]  Wise men follow him, when the road comes again.
[01:34:18.335 --> 01:34:23.319]  Wise men follow him, thank God for the renegade.
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:37.601]  We're good to go.
[01:35:02.549 --> 01:35:30.276]  Declaring independence They laid their bodies down On a bloody war And liberty for their descendants Thanks to the renegades We're free today Thanks to the renegades We're free today
[01:35:36.704 --> 01:35:38.565]  Okay, I know we got a bunch of phone calls.
[01:35:38.585 --> 01:35:39.506]  I'm going to get to them.
[01:35:39.526 --> 01:35:47.071]  I just want to remind new listeners that you can go back and listen to broadcasts I did five, ten, even twelve years ago.
[01:35:47.091 --> 01:35:49.253]  We're talking about the North American Union.
[01:35:49.273 --> 01:35:50.994]  We're talking about national ID cards.
[01:35:51.334 --> 01:35:52.755]  We're talking about FEMA camps.
[01:35:52.795 --> 01:35:57.438]  We're talking about our military was going to be made up of foreigners, predominantly from Latin America.
[01:35:58.179 --> 01:35:59.760]  All of it is now mainstream news.
[01:36:00.777 --> 01:36:08.904]  Ten years ago I was talking about how they'd have plans to push and promote implantable microchips for security or to have certain jobs or for children or Alzheimer patients.
[01:36:08.944 --> 01:36:10.145]  I was reading Pentagon documents.
[01:36:10.205 --> 01:36:10.845]  I'm not psychic.
[01:36:11.346 --> 01:36:12.427]  Now it's mainstream news.
[01:36:12.987 --> 01:36:14.488]  So we talk about real issues.
[01:36:14.529 --> 01:36:15.750]  We are trailblazers.
[01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:18.232]  We are explorers here on the cutting edge.
[01:36:18.872 --> 01:36:24.217]  And we're putting together a video report that's going to go up on the web of the Taylor FEMA Center.
[01:36:24.257 --> 01:36:26.939]  This is a center for entire families.
[01:36:27.988 --> 01:36:35.333]  And just briefly, I wanted to come in here and both of you give you their rundown of what happened at the Taylor facility.
[01:36:36.053 --> 01:36:43.277]  Aaron Dykes is putting together a report that will be going up tonight for everybody at InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com.
[01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:45.119]  The first place you'll see is JonesReport.com.
[01:36:45.659 --> 01:36:48.461]  Aaron does video editing, camera work, and webmasters.
[01:36:48.481 --> 01:36:50.262]  JonesReport.com.
[01:36:50.662 --> 01:36:55.545]  You heard from Kevin Smith yesterday on the ground via cell phone while Aaron was videotaping.
[01:36:56.309 --> 01:36:56.810]  The facility.
[01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:59.633]  So let's hear from Aaron first on this issue.
[01:36:59.653 --> 01:37:08.023]  Aaron, give us your take on what's happening at the facility and run down what you witnessed and some of the things after the show ended that you guys saw out there yesterday.
[01:37:08.817 --> 01:37:09.417]  Sure, yeah.
[01:37:09.477 --> 01:37:20.580]  Basically, we showed up at a private holding facility that looks just like a public prison would, that interacts with Homeland Security and other public officials, and they don't want to be seen.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:24.641]  And most of the people in Taylor, Texas don't even really know it's there.
[01:37:24.701 --> 01:37:28.542]  It's hidden in the bad part of town behind the railway stations.
[01:37:29.062 --> 01:37:32.245]  We were told to turn off our cameras and we were brushed off the property.
[01:37:32.265 --> 01:37:36.988]  We even had an ICE officer come up and try to tell us he's one of the good guys.
[01:37:37.088 --> 01:37:45.555]  Now let's be clear, by property you were up on the edge of it, by the road there, and then even once you were across the street, they came over and said turn your camera off.
[01:37:45.655 --> 01:37:46.296]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:37:46.316 --> 01:37:51.740]  I mean, that's despicable that they think they can tell American press to turn their cameras off.
[01:37:53.214 --> 01:37:58.417]  Yeah, I mean, the First Amendment's always up for grabs, I guess, in their eyes.
[01:37:58.798 --> 01:38:05.982]  Well, I mean, just boil down what you saw, what you witnessed, what some of the people that showed up, about eight different people that we asked folks to show up there, it's out in the middle of nowhere, that's a pretty good number.
[01:38:06.422 --> 01:38:13.247]  I mean, think of it, some of the Minutemen showed up, and they're exposing a facility to make sure the immigrants get their due process.
[01:38:13.527 --> 01:38:16.449]  But again, as the Houston Chronicle reported, this is really for U.S.
[01:38:16.489 --> 01:38:19.911]  citizens as they set the precedent to put whole families in these facilities.
[01:38:20.948 --> 01:38:28.657]  Yeah, we actually saw children and adults out on the recess grounds who were let out, you know, just for a short time, probably an hour or less.
[01:38:29.398 --> 01:38:30.479]  You've now got video of that?
[01:38:30.679 --> 01:38:32.001]  We do have some video of that, yeah.
[01:38:32.521 --> 01:38:34.303]  What time do you think it'll be up this evening?
[01:38:35.625 --> 01:38:36.486]  Sometime this evening.
[01:38:36.906 --> 01:38:37.687]  No telling.
[01:38:38.374 --> 01:38:39.354]  As soon as possible, yeah.
[01:38:39.394 --> 01:38:40.475]  Well, you're putting a lot into it.
[01:38:41.175 --> 01:38:44.516]  In fact, you're going back and putting Senate reports about FEMA camps in from the 80s.
[01:38:45.016 --> 01:38:48.017]  You're putting local newscasts in about the current camp.
[01:38:48.677 --> 01:38:49.458]  You cover a lot.
[01:38:49.578 --> 01:38:51.318]  Aaron, any other facets you want to cover?
[01:38:52.839 --> 01:38:53.279]  Not right now.
[01:38:53.319 --> 01:38:54.379]  We'll see the report tonight.
[01:38:55.559 --> 01:38:57.420]  What did you think being out there at a FEMA camp?
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:38:59.541]  It's definitely scary.
[01:38:59.581 --> 01:39:03.622]  I mean, whether you call it for immigrants right now, it's for people.
[01:39:04.582 --> 01:39:06.563]  And it'll be citizens later on.
[01:39:07.734 --> 01:39:09.539]  Well, I mean, they admit that, Kevin Smith.
[01:39:09.980 --> 01:39:16.398]  Well, the initial reason we went out yesterday, there was a planned protest for this Jordanian family that's been split up.
[01:39:17.738 --> 01:39:19.199]  The child's gone to CPS.
[01:39:47.897 --> 01:40:09.085]  And we went out to see this protest that did not, wasn't there, and so you put out the call on the air yesterday, and we did have some people respond and come out there, and I think it's important that we don't forget what happened yesterday and the day before, because we know from the Rex 84 plans that when this got exposed, they would say, well, it's going to be for the illegal aliens.
[01:40:09.625 --> 01:40:13.027]  And we may hope that that's what it's for, but people, they're getting rid of the border.
[01:40:13.368 --> 01:40:15.009]  They're not getting rid of illegal aliens.
[01:40:15.049 --> 01:40:18.971]  So see through that smoke screen, it is not for illegal aliens.
[01:40:19.011 --> 01:40:26.136]  And the thing I found yesterday that was strange is that apparently it is no longer part of CCA.
[01:40:26.236 --> 01:40:30.099]  It looks like they have transferred that over to ICE and Homeland Security now.
[01:40:31.184 --> 01:40:31.985]  That was this week.
[01:40:32.305 --> 01:40:35.028]  They just transferred it, but CCA's still out there.
[01:40:35.668 --> 01:40:54.225]  Yeah, you know, it's very blurred between, and initially started in 2004, they said, well, we're under-bedded, we don't have enough people in here, we're going to close this facility down, take it out of being a prison, and they do own one right up the street in Bartlett that's still operating as a prison, but they decided to
[01:40:54.585 --> 01:40:55.105]  What do they call it?
[01:40:55.125 --> 01:40:58.047]  Residential Living Center or something like that?
[01:40:58.187 --> 01:41:03.330]  Let's talk about the railway station that comes right up to 100 feet from the main gate.
[01:41:04.171 --> 01:41:08.093]  Well, Taylor is a very heavy rail yard sort of city.
[01:41:08.133 --> 01:41:09.214]  It always has been.
[01:41:09.254 --> 01:41:14.297]  They do a lot of crew transfers there and there's just a really large rail line and that is the
[01:41:16.172 --> 01:41:18.373]  Here in Austin, it's an east-west versus thing.
[01:41:18.433 --> 01:41:20.054]  The have-nots live on the east side.
[01:41:20.634 --> 01:41:21.235]  35 divides them.
[01:41:21.595 --> 01:41:22.956]  In Taylor, it's north-south.
[01:41:23.696 --> 01:41:25.697]  South of the tracks is the bad area.
[01:41:25.737 --> 01:41:28.599]  This complex is right there at the rail yard.
[01:41:28.659 --> 01:41:32.461]  They could easily transport people into rail cars there.
[01:41:33.002 --> 01:41:36.143]  Most people in Taylor have no idea that it's even there.
[01:41:37.604 --> 01:41:38.685]  It goes right over their heads.
[01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:39.526]  They have no idea.
[01:41:39.746 --> 01:41:55.498]  Now, let's be clear, because they have a FEMA emergency management center they keep very quiet out at the old airport here in Austin, which they admit is for citizens, and they have them in every major city, like Pier 57 in New York, where they held 2,000 people in the 2004 demonstrations.
[01:41:55.518 --> 01:41:57.980]  They were just arresting whole crowds of innocent people for no reason.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:58.921]  With freedom fencing.
[01:41:59.461 --> 01:42:03.144]  They call it freedom fencing, yeah, and they put in this barbed wire inside these big facilities
[01:42:03.804 --> 01:42:08.526]  So the point is, this is the whole move of our society into this, and the question is why?
[01:42:08.566 --> 01:42:14.789]  I mean, ITT Technical, they hardly have any offices open anymore to teach technical stuff, but oh, they'll teach law enforcement.
[01:42:14.809 --> 01:42:22.073]  I have a big article in Washington Post today about how all the security guards are starting to get cop power now, and they're out running checkpoints and pulling people over.
[01:42:24.383 --> 01:42:27.404]  It's like the Pinkerton man or the Ballinger man.
[01:42:27.444 --> 01:42:31.565]  These are private goon squads that operate outside the law.
[01:42:32.105 --> 01:42:39.727]  I think we need to be really reticent and watch these developments because it's happening right in front of us.
[01:42:39.767 --> 01:42:41.567]  The papers are talking about it.
[01:42:41.587 --> 01:42:42.627]  They're funding these camps.
[01:42:42.647 --> 01:42:44.048]  They're building them.
[01:42:44.188 --> 01:42:46.188]  Realize that these are just interim camps.
[01:42:46.208 --> 01:42:47.309]  They're processing centers.
[01:42:47.329 --> 01:42:50.509]  They're not designed to hold people, great numbers of people, for very long.
[01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:52.710]  Well, that's the truth.
[01:42:53.996 --> 01:42:55.296]  There's a lot of facets to this.
[01:42:55.336 --> 01:42:57.777]  We've got a video report again going up later this afternoon.
[01:42:58.397 --> 01:43:03.899]  But what were the people saying that did show up out there to be observers, to make sure they didn't try to take your cameras?
[01:43:03.919 --> 01:43:04.840]  Because you did hear them.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.820]  And were you able to pick that up on tape?
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:12.522]  Because Kevin and you, Aaron, had heard them talking about, well, hey, they got some of our faces.
[01:43:12.562 --> 01:43:14.283]  Maybe we need to get their tapes.
[01:43:14.643 --> 01:43:21.005]  And that's when I really got concerned, because we've had people, well, we've had military at gunpoint take our cameras in San Antonio one time.
[01:43:21.765 --> 01:43:25.328]  Military police there at the edge of a base, Fort Sam Houston.
[01:43:27.049 --> 01:43:31.933]  What's it like in the US of A to have people coming over and saying, turn that camera off?
[01:43:32.754 --> 01:43:33.915]  Yeah, it's very frightening.
[01:43:33.955 --> 01:43:35.757]  I mean, it's certainly a real feeling throughout.
[01:43:35.777 --> 01:43:38.319]  I'm not sure exactly what we caught on video and what we didn't.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.903]  It definitely happened, and it was kind of that chaotic moment.
[01:43:41.923 --> 01:43:45.867]  Well, I've seen the video you were working with this morning and last night where he's saying, turn the camera off.
[01:43:46.367 --> 01:43:48.449]  But I know it happened multiple times.
[01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.570]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:43:49.610 --> 01:43:56.377]  What you saw last night was the ICE officer in the middle of a public road, not even on their property, telling me to put my camera down.
[01:43:57.017 --> 01:43:57.317]  I don't know.
[01:44:15.771 --> 01:44:16.171]  I don't know.
[01:44:16.231 --> 01:44:17.413]  I have some real mixed feelings.
[01:44:17.453 --> 01:44:26.027]  I think we gave them a bit of a thrill yesterday because like the perimeter security people, they just drive the perimeter at five miles an hour in a truck all day for eight hours a day.
[01:44:26.047 --> 01:44:30.534]  I think we gave them a bit of a thrill because they got to U-turn, double back, stare us down.
[01:44:30.994 --> 01:44:37.018]  And I think after they let the older inmates out into the yard for a little while, we were expecting it was like the end of a classroom.
[01:44:37.038 --> 01:44:42.022]  Yeah, we talked to other demonstrators who have been there, and we talked to other neighbors in the past, and they said they let the kids out around 1 o'clock.
[01:44:42.282 --> 01:44:45.885]  They wouldn't let them out until you guys left and came back at dusk, and they did let them out.
[01:44:45.945 --> 01:44:51.769]  Yeah, we were watching them, and they were watching us, and I think we really got the impression they weren't going to let the children out until we were gone.
[01:44:51.829 --> 01:44:58.814]  So we went and grabbed some barbecue, and as we were leaving town, Aaron goes, let's go by one more time and look, and sure enough, there they were.
[01:44:59.834 --> 01:45:04.355]  We ran our fat rear ends back across the field and they kind of have a moat situation there, too.
[01:45:04.375 --> 01:45:08.396]  You know, the yard is, you know, there's nobody in the gun towers, but they do have them.
[01:45:09.016 --> 01:45:12.497]  And we were thinking like Brubaker, you know, we're out there in the outside.
[01:45:12.537 --> 01:45:15.278]  Well, hell, it's 40-foot fences with Constantino wire.
[01:45:15.818 --> 01:45:16.898]  Double, double fences.
[01:45:16.998 --> 01:45:20.499]  And there's a no-man's land in between them that's lit with spotlights.
[01:45:21.949 --> 01:45:25.112]  It's a pretty stark looking thing.
[01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:26.113]  Now, let's be clear.
[01:45:26.173 --> 01:45:28.115]  The Associated Press reported that 500 major lenders
[01:45:34.891 --> 01:45:42.319]  Are giving housing loans and business accounts and private accounts at banks, quote, with no ID.
[01:45:42.339 --> 01:45:49.007]  And the federal government is, quote, encouraging them to do this, quote, so these communities cannot be removed.
[01:45:49.467 --> 01:45:56.455]  The Congress votes to allow later funding of a 700-mile fence, and Chertoff says it's not going to be built, was never going to be built.
[01:45:57.055 --> 01:46:01.260]  And so, they arrest every few months a thousand or so people in some televised raid.
[01:46:01.761 --> 01:46:04.144]  Let's take the conservative number of 15 million people here.
[01:46:04.564 --> 01:46:10.050]  If they arrested a thousand a day, that'd be, you know, not even that many at the end of a year.
[01:46:10.571 --> 01:46:11.492]  Okay?
[01:46:11.652 --> 01:46:15.337]  So, we're not even talking about three-tenths of a million here.
[01:46:16.357 --> 01:46:21.881]  In a year, 300,000 that would be arrested, or I guess it would be 365,000 that would be arrested.
[01:46:22.321 --> 01:46:31.826]  So, not even four-tenths of a million here, but instead it's 1,000 every few months in big stage, nationally televised, smoke and mirrors events.
[01:46:32.647 --> 01:46:34.468]  And you said some Minutemen were out there.
[01:46:35.588 --> 01:46:42.152]  Talking to them, because I've interviewed a lot of them here on air, do they understand that Bush is running a big scam, or were they there to support
[01:46:43.697 --> 01:46:50.103]  These other-than-Mexican immigrants that are having their due process violated and their kids shipped off to CPS?
[01:46:51.224 --> 01:46:51.705]  I don't know.
[01:46:51.745 --> 01:46:57.650]  That was a weird question in my mind to this day, or to this time, because they came out to support and said, we got your back.
[01:46:57.710 --> 01:46:59.312]  Anytime you need us, we're there for you.
[01:46:59.652 --> 01:47:03.856]  But at the same time, they've got a bumper sticker that says, you know, Bush Cheney 04, Condi 08.
[01:47:06.725 --> 01:47:15.995]  They're caught in the middle, they're confused, and as much as we are, I mean, we still have trouble grasping it, and we really know all the information, but it just gets so disorganized.
[01:47:17.156 --> 01:47:18.858]  Well, really, it's just the elite against the people.
[01:47:19.438 --> 01:47:26.646]  But, I mean, for listeners out there, though, you need to understand, they admit that these new camps are for illegals.
[01:47:27.729 --> 01:47:35.214]  And for those that have been involved in immigration violations, or suspected of immigration violations, but they admit it's for U.S.
[01:47:35.254 --> 01:47:35.614]  citizens.
[01:47:35.634 --> 01:47:44.339]  But the point is, in fact, we ought to get that newscast you've got, we ought to upload it to the network so I can play that for people out of Dallas, where they admit that CPS came and took
[01:47:44.859 --> 01:47:49.905]  This, uh, this Arabic family's child, uh, because it's a citizen.
[01:47:50.325 --> 01:47:52.047]  No, the child should stay with the parents.
[01:47:52.087 --> 01:47:55.191]  But see, that shows any excuse to break up these families.
[01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:55.891]  It's like Katrina.
[01:47:56.192 --> 01:47:58.614]  Oh no, the kids are going on this plane, you're going on that plane.
[01:47:59.115 --> 01:48:00.016]  And you don't have a choice.
[01:48:00.076 --> 01:48:02.479]  I mean, again, they're setting these precedents.
[01:48:04.253 --> 01:48:12.560]  Uh, so true, and you know, we don't have to, you don't have to say, well, black is white and up is down and all that thing and that everything out of their mouths are lies.
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:13.660]  We just need to pay attention.
[01:48:14.001 --> 01:48:16.322]  Don't listen to what they say, pay attention to their actions.
[01:48:16.362 --> 01:48:25.229]  We have the two border agents that are facing 20 years in prison right now and a $5 million civil suit from a Mexican drug dealer that they got into a firefight with on the border.
[01:48:25.269 --> 01:48:30.013]  And they admit he was shooting at them, but they're saying, well, Border Patrol isn't allowed to pursue drug dealers.
[01:48:30.553 --> 01:48:33.354]  Well, they have less powers than a security guard, basically.
[01:48:33.795 --> 01:48:36.236]  They're not even allowed to patrol certain areas.
[01:48:36.316 --> 01:48:37.576]  It's a joke, okay?
[01:48:38.097 --> 01:48:38.937]  It is a joke.
[01:48:39.237 --> 01:48:41.978]  What they need to be doing is apprehending people at the border.
[01:48:42.298 --> 01:48:47.521]  They need to be fining and going after employers, and that will nip this in the bud.
[01:48:47.841 --> 01:48:52.223]  Believe me, they start charging, you know, not every few months, grab a thousand illegals and ship half of them back.
[01:48:52.783 --> 01:48:53.544]  Every day.
[01:48:54.765 --> 01:48:58.189]  Notice how they love to enforce every law that doesn't even really exist or isn't constitutional.
[01:48:58.509 --> 01:49:00.471]  But they could be enforcing against these businesses.
[01:49:00.491 --> 01:49:03.815]  They need to be enforcing against these businesses right now.
[01:49:04.275 --> 01:49:05.817]  But I mean, hell, right here in Austin.
[01:49:05.837 --> 01:49:08.500]  The city of Austin employs so many illegal aliens it'll make your head spin.
[01:49:09.443 --> 01:49:18.908]  Vicente Fox came here three years ago and gave an award to the City of Austin, APD, for not following the law and being an amnesty... what do they call it?
[01:49:18.928 --> 01:49:20.789]  Sanctuary City.
[01:49:20.809 --> 01:49:26.792]  Assistant Chief Rudy Landros received that award from Vicente Fox, as well as Wells Fargo.
[01:49:27.652 --> 01:49:30.474]  Because they give them a debit card that's been accepted as an ID card.
[01:49:30.954 --> 01:49:35.419]  Yeah, and now we've got Bank of America even trumping what Wells Fargo was doing.
[01:49:36.260 --> 01:49:37.201]  It's all in Spanish.
[01:49:37.702 --> 01:49:38.923]  All in Spanish now.
[01:49:39.584 --> 01:49:41.666]  Transfer money for free, free home loans.
[01:49:42.547 --> 01:49:45.170]  Like Ron Paul says, the libertarian view of this
[01:49:45.851 --> 01:49:47.533]  It used to be illegal aliens would come in.
[01:49:47.553 --> 01:49:51.336]  They were very agriculture oriented, ranch oriented, you know, northern Mexico ranches.
[01:49:51.636 --> 01:49:55.599]  They would take their American dollars and go back and live very well in Mexico.
[01:49:55.639 --> 01:49:57.541]  But now, it's the social services.
[01:49:57.601 --> 01:49:59.243]  I mean, why would they come?
[01:49:59.283 --> 01:50:00.904]  They can have everything for free.
[01:50:00.944 --> 01:50:01.905]  And I think if we were to
[01:50:02.885 --> 01:50:03.585]  Enforce that?
[01:50:03.605 --> 01:50:07.867]  Well, yeah, but it's also discriminatory against other immigrant groups.
[01:50:08.607 --> 01:50:11.608]  I mean, it's hard for a European to immigrate to the U.S.
[01:50:12.268 --> 01:50:13.729]  Very hard, very discriminatory.
[01:50:14.449 --> 01:50:21.192]  They are grabbing some Arabs and others, and it's almost like they're doing it as a stunt to demonize those of us that want to control the border.
[01:50:21.512 --> 01:50:29.474]  They're abusing these people publicly in front of everyone to then set the precedent to not enforce on any of these illegal aliens by violating their due process.
[01:50:29.494 --> 01:50:30.215]  They're slick, man.
[01:50:30.235 --> 01:50:30.895]  They know what they're doing.
[01:50:31.405 --> 01:50:32.886]  Yeah, it's been since the mid-60s.
[01:50:32.926 --> 01:50:38.550]  I believe Ted Kennedy pushed the law through that we really stop the immigration of Northern Europeans into the country.
[01:50:39.070 --> 01:50:41.832]  Fortunately, my dad had come in on a work visa before then.
[01:50:41.852 --> 01:50:43.753]  But your mom's from Texas, your dad's a redcoat.
[01:50:43.853 --> 01:50:45.815]  Yeah, he's a redcoat aerospace engineer.
[01:50:46.275 --> 01:50:47.856]  And we see the same problems here.
[01:50:47.956 --> 01:50:51.178]  It's very convenient to bring the Mexicans in because they border us.
[01:50:51.258 --> 01:50:53.260]  But in Germany, it's Turkish people.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.301]  In France, it's Moroccan and Algerian.
[01:50:55.361 --> 01:50:58.243]  And in Britain, it's Pakistan and India.
[01:50:58.323 --> 01:51:00.985]  So the same thing is applied to all Western
[01:51:01.525 --> 01:51:06.146]  Oh yeah, the globalists, the very people running the Iraq War, are the ones that are destroying our sovereignty.
[01:51:06.606 --> 01:51:11.647]  The very people that are overrunning our country, allowing it to happen, are the ones overrunning Europe.
[01:51:11.707 --> 01:51:13.547]  This is designed to destroy a middle class.
[01:51:13.867 --> 01:51:16.228]  If the middle class was black here, they'd be bringing in whites.
[01:51:16.808 --> 01:51:17.728]  Guys, thanks for coming in.
[01:51:17.748 --> 01:51:19.008]  Aaron, good job out there on camera.
[01:51:19.028 --> 01:51:19.668]  Good job, Kevin.
[01:51:20.628 --> 01:51:21.289]  Well, thank you.
[01:51:22.069 --> 01:51:24.149]  It was eye-opening, to say the least.
[01:51:24.329 --> 01:51:25.369]  Alright, thanks for coming in.
[01:51:25.669 --> 01:51:27.670]  This will be part two of our report we'll put up tomorrow.
[01:51:27.690 --> 01:51:28.870]  The other report will be up tonight.
[01:51:29.611 --> 01:51:31.033]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[01:51:31.053 --> 01:51:31.493]  Stay with me.

[01:51:39.703 --> 01:51:41.645]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:51:42.026 --> 01:51:49.675]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:50.347 --> 01:51:57.390]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:57.791 --> 01:52:09.196]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:09.516 --> 01:52:13.058]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:13.498 --> 01:52:15.439]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:15.759 --> 01:52:19.581]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:55:06.133 --> 01:55:11.358]  And don't forget, you can also hear the radio show re-aired streaming 24 hours a day.
[01:55:11.398 --> 01:55:24.351]  When it ends at 2 o'clock central, it re-airs over and over again, and on a growing list of M&M's stations out there that carry the transmission at different times, as well as WWCR, 11 to 2 central, back from 9 to midnight central,
[01:55:25.379 --> 01:55:28.543]  And you can, of course, get my 15 documentary films.
[01:55:29.024 --> 01:55:37.635]  I put my first 7, which I've never gotten on DVD, they're finally all on DVD, from Matrix to Evil, to The Masters of Terror, to my 3 police state films in a box set for $34.95.
[01:55:37.675 --> 01:55:38.316]  That is a 45% discount.

[01:56:17.351 --> 01:56:23.898]  And that is about five plus months, what, 5.3 months free when you get a PrisonPlanet.tv year membership.
[01:56:24.239 --> 01:56:26.421]  Okay, you get almost half a year free when you sign up.
[01:56:27.091 --> 01:56:31.814]  There's only about a week and a half left of that special at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:31.834 --> 01:56:38.938]  It's such a great activist tool because you can go get your membership and then just download them in super high quality, burn them to disk, give them to everybody you know.
[01:56:39.278 --> 01:56:40.099]  A lot of you are doing that.
[01:56:40.119 --> 01:56:40.779]  I want to commend you.
[01:56:40.819 --> 01:56:41.220]  Keep it up.
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:44.782]  My weekly TV report, in-studio video interviews, special reports.
[01:56:44.842 --> 01:56:45.642]  It's just there's so much.
[01:56:46.022 --> 01:56:48.284]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:48.704 --> 01:56:50.585]  We're going to trial membership for $5.95 a month.
[01:56:51.686 --> 01:56:53.167]  Let's now go to your calls.
[01:56:53.807 --> 01:56:56.708]  Let's talk to Don in the great state of Alabama.
[01:56:56.969 --> 01:56:57.289]  Hello.
[01:56:57.589 --> 01:56:58.329]  Hello, Alex.
[01:56:58.369 --> 01:56:58.829]  How you doing?
[01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:59.290]  Good, sir.
[01:56:59.850 --> 01:57:01.031]  Oh, man, I tell you what.
[01:57:01.051 --> 01:57:01.991]  I'm about to blow up.
[01:57:02.071 --> 01:57:04.372]  What is wrong with these Christians, brother?
[01:57:05.333 --> 01:57:11.435]  They think they're doing some self-fulfilled prophecy by letting everything come on us like it's doing.
[01:57:11.475 --> 01:57:12.596]  It's blowing my mind.
[01:57:13.365 --> 01:57:13.985]  Well, that's it.
[01:57:14.806 --> 01:57:21.129]  Until 150 years ago, Christians said we have to be in the front lines fighting evil, and it was assault of the earth, the lot of the earth.
[01:57:21.489 --> 01:57:24.750]  Now they just smile and giggle and say, I know it's getting bad.
[01:57:25.171 --> 01:57:29.173]  That means I'll be getting taken out of here on a golden ejection seat soon.
[01:57:29.793 --> 01:57:31.974]  And, you know, they thought that in Nazi Germany, too.
[01:57:32.594 --> 01:57:34.135]  And it's just disgusting.
[01:57:34.175 --> 01:57:34.875]  What do you think about it?
[01:57:35.035 --> 01:57:35.736]  Well, brother, listen.
[01:57:35.876 --> 01:57:40.358]  I pastored three different churches from Alaska, Montana, and in Montgomery, Alabama.
[01:57:40.791 --> 01:57:44.592]  And like you're into this, I've been in the book for 31 years.
[01:57:44.992 --> 01:57:46.253]  And they don't understand.
[01:57:46.653 --> 01:57:49.013]  They can't get past Ephesians chapter 6.
[01:57:49.734 --> 01:57:51.434]  They think everything is inward.
[01:57:51.914 --> 01:57:53.075]  And it's not, brother.
[01:57:53.415 --> 01:57:53.955]  It's not.
[01:57:54.795 --> 01:58:01.157]  They've got to understand that there is another force controlling these people, therefore they should stand up against them.
[01:58:02.797 --> 01:58:04.618]  I've listened to Pastor Butch Paul.
[01:58:05.191 --> 01:58:11.976]  And I appreciate what he's doing and everything, but he needs to get to that New Testament stuff and study it out a little bit more.
[01:58:13.357 --> 01:58:14.919]  What particularly are you talking about?
[01:58:15.059 --> 01:58:16.800]  I'm talking about the Ephesians 6 part.
[01:58:16.940 --> 01:58:26.788]  Everybody thinks, all the Christians that I'm dealing with, brother, and I've done past that all kind of literature, I'm copying all stuff, continuously on where I'm fixing to get on the radio down here.
[01:58:27.188 --> 01:58:27.428]  Good!
[01:58:29.834 --> 01:58:34.217]  Well, I don't understand how most of the prophets were killed for standing up against corrupt government.
[01:58:34.777 --> 01:58:36.278]  Jesus was killed for that.
[01:58:36.318 --> 01:58:37.719]  He beat the money changers.
[01:58:38.059 --> 01:58:44.643]  And then they just quote Romans 13 out of context when the whole history of Christianity was about standing up against evil.
[01:58:45.084 --> 01:58:47.445]  Brother, it's got nothing to do with a Roman.
[01:58:47.585 --> 01:58:53.589]  They always quote Romans 13 and 99% of them don't even know what the context is all about.
[01:58:54.204 --> 01:58:55.225]  It's aggravating.
[01:58:55.485 --> 01:58:56.706]  Oh, by the way, one question.
[01:58:57.026 --> 01:58:59.928]  Fort McClellan, Alabama, is it set aside for a FEMA camp?
[01:59:00.268 --> 01:59:00.548]  Yes.
[01:59:01.028 --> 01:59:02.890]  That's what I've been trying to tell everybody.
[01:59:02.910 --> 01:59:03.570]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:59:03.590 --> 01:59:04.931]  Stay there, sir, for one minute.
[01:59:05.491 --> 01:59:06.252]  You want to be exact.
[01:59:06.272 --> 01:59:06.892]  Seventy seconds.
[01:59:06.912 --> 01:59:09.554]  I'll come back and tell you about some FEMA camps.
[01:59:09.574 --> 01:59:10.254]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:12.756 --> 01:59:17.659]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.

[01:59:46.935 --> 01:59:53.060]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water,
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:55.662]  Long-term, low-energy, lice-free.

[02:00:22.583 --> 02:00:24.485]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:24.985 --> 02:00:27.888]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:34.293 --> 02:00:34.953]  Big Brother.
[02:00:35.614 --> 02:00:36.655]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:37.376 --> 02:00:38.496]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:39.137 --> 02:00:39.958]  You want answers?
[02:00:40.718 --> 02:00:41.619]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:46.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:46.463 --> 02:00:50.567]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:51.858 --> 02:01:12.647]  We are sliding into a control freak nanny state, where you're arrested for what you say, for your letter to the editor, for your comments, for handing out videos of Ron Paul, where the CPS comes after you, your children because you've got bloodshot eyes from allergies, where just everything is considered a crime.
[02:01:13.488 --> 02:01:15.048]  We're continuing with calls as well.
[02:01:15.468 --> 02:01:17.910]  We've got two guests coming up to tell their stories.
[02:01:19.450 --> 02:01:20.511]  We were talking to
[02:01:22.029 --> 02:01:24.371]  A caller, uh, is it Dan or Don in Alabama?
[02:01:25.172 --> 02:01:26.092]  Don in Alabama.
[02:01:26.152 --> 02:01:32.077]  And, you know, we've had all this FEMA camp talk the last few days because of the admitted FEMA camp in Taylor, Texas, just north of me.
[02:01:33.118 --> 02:01:37.521]  But I forget about one of the biggest pieces of evidence, not just the Senate hearings or all the admissions.
[02:01:38.802 --> 02:01:45.087]  In starting in 1986, they started a civilian inmate labor camp program in secret on 12 bases.
[02:01:45.627 --> 02:01:46.828]  They declassified it in 1997.
[02:01:46.968 --> 02:01:49.490]  It's in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:01:49.530 --> 02:01:50.671]  It's in my film, Road to Tyranny.
[02:01:52.037 --> 02:01:54.299]  And it's got the phone numbers and the names and the bases.
[02:01:54.899 --> 02:01:57.662]  And it says they got 12 camps operating in secret, now public.
[02:01:57.682 --> 02:01:59.603]  They're going to open another 24, they were saying, in 97.
[02:02:00.884 --> 02:02:07.370]  Where they take federal and state inmates and they bring them and they live on bases with troops then guarding them.
[02:02:08.371 --> 02:02:12.895]  And so that's to set the precedent of the military controlling regular convicts.
[02:02:13.895 --> 02:02:17.498]  And so this is real, this is here, it's a slow moving process.
[02:02:17.538 --> 02:02:19.380]  But now it's starting to speed up.
[02:02:20.006 --> 02:02:22.009]  They know how to do this to us incrementally.
[02:02:22.049 --> 02:02:22.991]  We're being domesticated.
[02:02:23.809 --> 02:02:25.690]  And we are a prison economy now.
[02:02:26.050 --> 02:02:28.831]  That's what the universities are switching over to as their main curriculum.
[02:02:29.291 --> 02:02:32.632]  You know, the main courses they offer, ITT, even the technical schools.
[02:02:33.052 --> 02:02:36.533]  It's all shifting into this because it isn't a free market economy.
[02:02:36.553 --> 02:02:38.474]  The globalists own the private central banks.
[02:02:38.794 --> 02:02:39.594]  They issue the money.
[02:02:40.054 --> 02:02:45.376]  They set up the entire economy to destroy the middle class, to destroy the family, so they can get control.
[02:02:45.696 --> 02:02:50.998]  But I have seen that particular Alabama base you mentioned as an auxiliary to control and hold populations.
[02:02:51.038 --> 02:02:51.518]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:02:52.038 --> 02:02:52.759]  Oh yes, Alex.
[02:02:52.859 --> 02:02:57.922]  And another thing, these Christians, a lot of them are thinking, oh well, I'll be a martyr for Christ.
[02:02:57.942 --> 02:03:06.128]  Well, the thing about it is, 99.9% of them, if they can't stand up when everything's going fine, they doggone sure are not going to stand up when it gets bad.
[02:03:07.458 --> 02:03:08.739]  Well, yeah, they're procrastinating.
[02:03:08.759 --> 02:03:11.862]  They're saying, well, when things get a lot worse, I'll get involved.
[02:03:12.162 --> 02:03:13.884]  That's going to ensure things do get worse.
[02:03:13.924 --> 02:03:15.845]  And they also have this attitude of, you can't change anything.
[02:03:16.126 --> 02:03:17.967]  Well, what about Jonah going to Nineveh?
[02:03:17.987 --> 02:03:23.532]  I mean, I want to give our society a reprieve so we have time to wake up more people.
[02:03:23.692 --> 02:03:25.013]  That's exactly right, brother.
[02:03:25.273 --> 02:03:26.314]  It drives me nuts.
[02:03:26.394 --> 02:03:27.836]  I go crazy with these people.
[02:03:27.876 --> 02:03:29.837]  They've got me branded as a heretic now.
[02:03:30.838 --> 02:03:35.461]  Well, I mean, do they think in your local churches that George Bush is like some type of saint and needs to be worshipped?
[02:03:35.601 --> 02:03:40.645]  Well, they're starting to see through George Bush, brother, but they always fall back.
[02:03:40.685 --> 02:03:42.306]  They fall back to what they've been taught.
[02:03:42.366 --> 02:03:43.827]  And I want to bring one more thing up.
[02:03:44.127 --> 02:03:47.089]  You know Pastor D. James Kennedy had a heart attack?
[02:03:48.050 --> 02:03:48.850]  No, I didn't know that.
[02:03:48.991 --> 02:03:50.391]  Oh yeah, a massive heart attack.
[02:03:50.472 --> 02:03:56.956]  I was just wondering if there's anything to that, because he was really coming out against this bunch that's tearing down the Constitution.
[02:03:57.569 --> 02:03:59.130]  You know, I've seen him on television.
[02:03:59.150 --> 02:04:08.672]  My grandmother loves him, and he's one of the few guys who'll talk about the UN, North American Union, and I know lately he's been writing some really hardcore articles, and that's too bad.
[02:04:08.712 --> 02:04:09.493]  He had a heart attack, huh?
[02:04:09.633 --> 02:04:10.833]  Massive heart attack, yes.
[02:04:12.674 --> 02:04:13.774]  Well, brother, I'll tell you what.
[02:04:13.854 --> 02:04:22.036]  I'm trying to put together some papers, and if there's anything I could do to help you other than what I'm doing here in Alabama, I would be more than glad to.
[02:04:22.077 --> 02:04:23.497]  If it comes to a Bible issue,
[02:04:24.068 --> 02:04:28.211]  I don't call myself a scholar, but like I said, I've spent 31 years in the book.
[02:04:30.913 --> 02:04:34.236]  I'd like to see somebody stand up before me and try to debate me on the issue.
[02:04:34.596 --> 02:04:35.917]  Alright, well good to hear from you.
[02:04:39.019 --> 02:04:41.902]  When I'm on vacation, it's about the only time I really watch a lot of TV.
[02:04:41.982 --> 02:04:51.709]  I've watched TV in the last few years when I'm sitting in a beach house somewhere on the Texas coast for a few days in between fishing or making sandcastles with the family.
[02:04:52.675 --> 02:04:55.898]  And for years I watched James Kennedy.
[02:04:57.239 --> 02:04:59.421]  And I did see him a few months ago when I was down at the beach.
[02:04:59.461 --> 02:05:00.561]  Boy, he was on fire!
[02:05:00.621 --> 02:05:04.384]  New World Order, North American Union, both parties are controlled.
[02:05:04.404 --> 02:05:06.846]  But, you know, he's an older fella.
[02:05:06.886 --> 02:05:08.488]  He might have had a real heart attack.
[02:05:08.528 --> 02:05:10.309]  But that is interesting.
[02:05:11.170 --> 02:05:14.032]  I hope he makes it back to the pulpit.
[02:05:14.793 --> 02:05:18.175]  But he's about the only person I've seen that's any good on TV.
[02:05:19.416 --> 02:05:21.438]  All the rest of them just mix in too many lies.
[02:05:22.779 --> 02:05:24.541]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:05:25.462 --> 02:05:26.082]  Stay with us.
[02:05:33.008 --> 02:05:33.529]  It's here.
[02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:38.473]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:38.854 --> 02:05:46.501]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:47.173 --> 02:05:54.216]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:54.636 --> 02:06:06.040]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:09.901]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:10.342 --> 02:06:12.262]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:12.582 --> 02:06:16.424]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:06:29.696 --> 02:06:34.800]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:06:34.860 --> 02:06:42.166]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:06:42.306 --> 02:06:52.935]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:06:53.155 --> 02:06:57.699]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:06:57.979 --> 02:07:02.943]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:07:03.163 --> 02:07:06.105]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:07:06.326 --> 02:07:16.193]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.

[02:07:31.921 --> 02:07:34.241]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:07:34.301 --> 02:07:38.823]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:07:39.403 --> 02:07:45.884]  Wrist Ease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:07:46.405 --> 02:07:58.508]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wrist Ease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:07:59.048 --> 02:08:02.850]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.

[02:08:20.958 --> 02:08:25.660]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:28.301]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[02:08:31.067 --> 02:08:37.091]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:37.691 --> 02:08:40.733]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:41.314 --> 02:08:42.715]  Alright, I want to be clear here.
[02:08:42.775 --> 02:08:51.540]  I have enough respect for you as an audience to think that you're not going to let this scare you, that you're not going to make this affect you where you then cower.
[02:08:52.821 --> 02:08:56.624]  We illustrate this because it's happening and people need support, number one.
[02:08:57.404 --> 02:09:00.266]  Number two, it illustrates the brainwashed
[02:09:01.287 --> 02:09:05.750]  Soviet-slash-fascist mindset of people in this country.
[02:09:06.691 --> 02:09:09.813]  Now, I've had national talk show hosts call for my arrest.
[02:09:09.953 --> 02:09:10.534]  I'm a traitor.
[02:09:10.574 --> 02:09:11.654]  I'm American Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:12.575 --> 02:09:14.396]  When I'm actually fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:09:15.117 --> 02:09:17.358]  And warned of the 9-11 attacks and tried to stop them.
[02:09:17.919 --> 02:09:21.961]  We've had the 9-11 Truth Movement on a daily basis nationally on TV and radio.
[02:09:22.462 --> 02:09:23.242]  Called traitors.
[02:09:23.282 --> 02:09:24.103]  We need to be arrested.
[02:09:26.022 --> 02:09:33.685]  And there have been other cases where it's been in the news where somebody puts up a sign saying our judicial system's a joke and it's an upstanding member of the community.
[02:09:34.225 --> 02:09:37.987]  And I point that out because it's even happening to, you know, big shots in towns.
[02:09:39.207 --> 02:09:40.888]  You know, guys that own the big lumber yard.
[02:09:40.908 --> 02:09:45.570]  I remember that case in Tennessee and the judge said, I don't, I think that's disrespectful.
[02:09:46.190 --> 02:09:48.131]  So he ordered the police to go arrest the guy.
[02:09:48.511 --> 02:09:52.472]  The judge later got kicked off the bench, but it shows their mindset.
[02:09:52.512 --> 02:09:54.333]  I remember Kelly rushing three years ago
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:10:01.361]  He made a VHS tape with Ron Paul's speech in the well of the House, in the Capitol!
[02:10:02.761 --> 02:10:08.002]  Republican congressman called neocon laying out that Bush wasn't a conservative.
[02:10:08.342 --> 02:10:10.423]  And then after that on the tape was Road to Tyranny.
[02:10:11.263 --> 02:10:13.763]  Put it on one slow play VHS tape.
[02:10:14.783 --> 02:10:16.304]  He gave it to a state police officer.
[02:10:16.764 --> 02:10:20.164]  Now when I first heard the story, I was ignorant three and a half years ago.
[02:10:20.184 --> 02:10:21.965]  I didn't believe this really went on in America.
[02:10:22.405 --> 02:10:23.645]  Again, it's always a learning process.
[02:10:24.474 --> 02:10:25.354]  I didn't think he was lying.
[02:10:25.394 --> 02:10:26.435]  He sounded very credible.
[02:10:26.975 --> 02:10:30.937]  But then he sent me the local newspaper saying, and they reported it like it was a good thing.
[02:10:31.537 --> 02:10:39.901]  Well, Kelly Rushing of the Rushing family here in town was arrested for giving a videotape to the police that they said was threatening and anti-law enforcement.
[02:10:41.842 --> 02:10:51.546]  So I see the judge's name in the paper saying how wonderful these charges are of uh... of uh... terroristic threats against the police, state police, in uh...
[02:10:52.614 --> 02:10:53.954]  They're in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[02:10:54.434 --> 02:11:04.296]  So I called up on a Sunday, and I called the judge's house, and he answered, and he said, I'm not going to talk about the case, but yes, you saw what's in the paper, and I said, you're going to go ahead and go ahead and draw.
[02:11:04.316 --> 02:11:05.236]  And he goes, well, you'll see.
[02:11:05.256 --> 02:11:07.037]  And I was very polite to the judge.
[02:11:08.057 --> 02:11:11.117]  Of course, I did it in front of my wife as a witness, so he couldn't try to make something up.
[02:11:13.078 --> 02:11:14.718]  But the point is, the judge didn't make something up.
[02:11:15.778 --> 02:11:17.258]  You know, this guy thinks it's normal.
[02:11:17.278 --> 02:11:18.119]  He thinks he's good.
[02:11:19.999 --> 02:11:20.559]  And, uh,
[02:11:21.724 --> 02:11:26.968]  They went to trial, and Kelly Rushing demanded a jury trial, and I called around the town after that.
[02:11:26.988 --> 02:11:29.770]  I wanted to find out if this Kelly Rushing guy was a bad guy around town.
[02:11:29.890 --> 02:11:34.794]  Oh, no, the Rushings have been here since, you know, for hundreds of years, and their family's prominent, and they're good.
[02:11:34.834 --> 02:11:37.876]  Kelly Rushing's a good Christian man in Sunday School.
[02:11:38.997 --> 02:11:40.017]  Local business owner.
[02:11:41.639 --> 02:11:44.601]  You know, this is just a good old boy with a farm and horses and a business.
[02:11:45.956 --> 02:11:52.359]  And the police, the state trooper testified that he walked up and politely gave him the tape.
[02:11:53.219 --> 02:11:59.721]  Well, the next day he pulled rushing over and he put him in the back of the police car, put him in handcuffs.
[02:11:59.741 --> 02:12:02.042]  So that's a threatening anti-law enforcement video.
[02:12:02.822 --> 02:12:04.123]  Road to Tyranny, Ron Paul speech.
[02:12:05.433 --> 02:12:08.656]  And then they said the Ron Paul speech was part of the charges.
[02:12:09.016 --> 02:12:11.779]  The congressman giving a speech in the floor of the house.
[02:12:12.339 --> 02:12:13.440]  Again, it shows the mind.
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:15.222]  I've got to get to my guest because we're running out of time here.
[02:12:15.883 --> 02:12:18.425]  And it went to trial and the jury found him not guilty.
[02:12:19.206 --> 02:12:23.710]  He was facing three years on two counts, each video, of terroristic threat.
[02:12:24.731 --> 02:12:25.091]  Okay?
[02:12:27.113 --> 02:12:29.675]  And the judge told the jury, this is a terroristic threat.
[02:12:29.695 --> 02:12:31.697]  This guy has terrorized this police officer.
[02:12:33.064 --> 02:12:40.587]  And he laughed at Kelly when Kelly was in the back of the squad car saying he called his wife on the cell phone and laughed and said, I've got the videotape bandit.
[02:12:42.128 --> 02:12:43.048]  Now see, that's America.
[02:12:43.468 --> 02:12:45.689]  This cop doesn't care he's about to ruin somebody's life.
[02:12:46.369 --> 02:12:48.190]  He doesn't care about the First Amendment.
[02:12:48.210 --> 02:12:49.271]  He doesn't even know what it is.
[02:12:49.331 --> 02:12:52.152]  It's just fun to just... It's psychopathic.
[02:12:52.492 --> 02:12:53.492]  That's what a psychopath does.
[02:12:53.512 --> 02:12:54.013]  They don't care.
[02:12:54.053 --> 02:12:54.793]  They don't empathize.
[02:12:55.413 --> 02:12:57.274]  Some nice good old boy gives him a video.
[02:12:57.978 --> 02:13:03.762]  And Kelly starts saying real nicely, and they tried to use the tape of this in court, and the jury saw it and said that he hadn't done anything.
[02:13:04.222 --> 02:13:09.826]  He was saying, Sir, I was just trying to warn you and your family about how the country's in... Oh, now you're threatening my family!
[02:13:10.947 --> 02:13:12.068]  So they tried that too.
[02:13:14.510 --> 02:13:17.852]  Well, Kelly walked up, and I talked to him the day he got out of court.
[02:13:17.892 --> 02:13:18.832]  He got out of court at like noon.
[02:13:18.893 --> 02:13:20.013]  We had him on right at the end of the show.
[02:13:21.374 --> 02:13:22.135]  You heard him on air.
[02:13:22.155 --> 02:13:23.716]  We've got to get Kelly back on.
[02:13:24.833 --> 02:13:26.053]  I'm trying to find his number the other day.
[02:13:26.073 --> 02:13:28.654]  Kelly, if you're listening, call back in sometime this week or next week.
[02:13:29.894 --> 02:13:30.815]  I don't have a guest owner.
[02:13:30.835 --> 02:13:31.115]  Call me.
[02:13:31.135 --> 02:13:31.635]  Give me your number.
[02:13:31.655 --> 02:13:32.195]  I couldn't find it.
[02:13:32.575 --> 02:13:34.996]  I guess I can look at information again in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[02:13:35.016 --> 02:13:39.477]  But there have been a bunch of other cases of this around the country.
[02:13:40.097 --> 02:13:43.438]  And Kelly walked up to that state police officer and he tried to shake his hand.
[02:13:43.458 --> 02:13:44.078]  He wouldn't shake it.
[02:13:44.098 --> 02:13:47.119]  And he said, Kelly, I'm real sorry about all this trouble.
[02:13:47.319 --> 02:13:48.159]  Turn on the other cheek.
[02:13:49.299 --> 02:13:51.220]  And that cop looked at him with pure hatred.
[02:13:51.849 --> 02:13:54.470]  Then they started pulling him over every day, harassing him.
[02:13:55.031 --> 02:13:59.913]  He and his buddy were riding horses by their farm, and they claimed they were drunkenly riding horses.
[02:14:00.674 --> 02:14:02.455]  I mean, that's the type of stuff they do.
[02:14:03.095 --> 02:14:15.622]  Now, shifting gears to Shirley M. Anderson, RN, registered nurse, and she lives in Coalville, Washington, one of the worst states for this we've seen.
[02:14:16.943 --> 02:14:18.043]  And she wrote a letter to the editor.
[02:14:18.063 --> 02:14:20.244]  We're going to be posting on JonesReport.com.
[02:14:20.284 --> 02:14:21.684]  I forgot to tell Erin to post this.
[02:14:21.704 --> 02:14:22.844]  We'll post it right now.
[02:14:24.025 --> 02:14:26.765]  And she talked about how Vietnam was staged.
[02:14:26.805 --> 02:14:32.046]  She talked about how Eisenhower warned about the military industrial complex.
[02:14:32.086 --> 02:14:40.448]  And then she talks about losing troops in Iraq and how it's wrong and how... about how our government was involved in 9-11.
[02:14:40.468 --> 02:14:41.188]  The evidence shows.
[02:14:41.808 --> 02:14:42.949]  And that's where the story starts.
[02:14:42.989 --> 02:14:43.949]  So we don't have long
[02:14:44.711 --> 02:14:57.362]  Shirley, but I want you to tell folks, just in a nutshell, then we'll go through more details, how this all started, why did it end up happening, and you've got these local librarians that think they're Jack Bauer, and you know, the local cops think this.
[02:14:57.903 --> 02:15:03.788]  It's really bad in small towns, and it's an illustration of how far we've come from Way Home of the Free, Home of the Brave.
[02:15:04.208 --> 02:15:05.469]  But ma'am, thank you for coming on.
[02:15:06.450 --> 02:15:07.411]  You're welcome, Alex.
[02:15:07.551 --> 02:15:10.594]  It's a pleasure to be with you for a few minutes.
[02:15:11.592 --> 02:15:27.782]  Um, it started a long time ago in the Pacific Northwest, in Tacoma, along what I call the I-5 Corridor of Hell, which goes from Seattle to Tacoma to the state capital in Olympia.
[02:15:28.902 --> 02:15:39.729]  And about eight years ago, my entire life, everything I loved and owned, taken from me, um, I had to leave the state.
[02:15:39.809 --> 02:15:40.469]  Broke my heart.
[02:15:41.266 --> 02:15:48.252]  Yeah, I was gone for about eight years and I was coerced, much to my ignorance, Alex.
[02:15:48.553 --> 02:15:50.514]  We don't have a lot of time.
[02:15:50.534 --> 02:15:54.258]  Let's tell the story of what happened with you handing out Terror Storm and Loose Change.
[02:15:54.338 --> 02:15:56.099]  Loose Change, 9-1-1 revisited.
[02:15:59.495 --> 02:16:08.381]  Uh, Stephen, uh, Professor Stephen Jones, Professor David Ray Griffin, uh... Okay, but listen, listen, you're listeners for the listeners, and we know Oregon's a police state.
[02:16:08.881 --> 02:16:14.185]  I mean, the point is, will you just tell us what happened to you at the library trying to give them free copies?
[02:16:14.445 --> 02:16:15.946]  Yeah, give them free copies.
[02:16:16.086 --> 02:16:17.647]  Never once ask them.
[02:16:19.343 --> 02:16:20.624]  Never once pressured them.
[02:16:21.084 --> 02:16:25.267]  When are they going to get on the documentary?
[02:16:25.287 --> 02:16:26.307]  So that's now terrorism.
[02:16:26.808 --> 02:16:27.508]  But let's go back.
[02:16:27.668 --> 02:16:29.629]  First you write a letter to the editor.
[02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:30.650]  That gets their attention.
[02:16:30.710 --> 02:16:32.011]  And then what happens next?
[02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:32.631]  Tell us the story.
[02:16:33.712 --> 02:16:34.192]  Okay.
[02:16:36.154 --> 02:16:40.296]  On 12th December, an officer comes to the door.
[02:16:41.517 --> 02:16:45.460]  And I had just posted this letter to the local newspaper.
[02:16:46.127 --> 02:16:52.794]  And I gave a courtesy copy to the library early in the day.
[02:16:52.814 --> 02:16:57.238]  And late that evening, an officer comes to my house and asks me if I'm suicidal.
[02:16:57.679 --> 02:16:58.620]  I say, of course not.
[02:16:58.660 --> 02:16:59.521]  I never have been.
[02:17:00.532 --> 02:17:05.234]  By the way, this happened to G. Gordon Liddy, the lady that does his voiceovers on the show.
[02:17:05.314 --> 02:17:06.234]  G. Gordon Liddy.
[02:17:06.534 --> 02:17:09.635]  Famous model, pretty big actress.
[02:17:10.416 --> 02:17:13.237]  And they just for no reason came after her saying she was suicidal.
[02:17:13.477 --> 02:17:16.558]  So this is a tactic they use to get into your life.
[02:17:17.358 --> 02:17:20.920]  It's the social worker nexus point that gets around the Constitution.
[02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:22.160]  But tell folks what happened.
[02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:27.362]  Well, I apprised him that no, I am not suicidal.
[02:17:27.402 --> 02:17:29.163]  I have never been, nor would I ever be.
[02:17:29.713 --> 02:17:34.782]  He gave me his business card and said, Shirley, if you ever want to talk to me, you call me up.
[02:17:34.863 --> 02:17:35.925]  And I go, oh, yeah, right.
[02:17:37.267 --> 02:17:38.289]  And he left.
[02:17:38.369 --> 02:17:39.231]  I closed the door.
[02:17:39.963 --> 02:17:44.044]  But he had said enough, or I knew where it started.
[02:17:44.224 --> 02:17:47.925]  It started when... Sure, you gave him a letter to the editor that had your phone number and your name.
[02:17:47.985 --> 02:17:49.925]  Now they know who the lady is that comes in.
[02:17:49.945 --> 02:17:50.945]  Yes, exactly.
[02:17:51.065 --> 02:17:55.346]  Asking him to carry the videos politely, and so you know who did it.
[02:17:55.406 --> 02:17:56.727]  You then call up the library.
[02:17:57.027 --> 02:17:58.027]  I called the library.
[02:17:58.047 --> 02:18:06.569]  She says, oh, I called the executive secretary of the police department, and we decided you're suicidal.
[02:18:07.444 --> 02:18:11.766]  And I swore at her and hung up within a couple of minutes.
[02:18:12.367 --> 02:18:15.568]  The police officer, can I say his name, Alex, or I'm not allowed to do that?
[02:18:16.529 --> 02:18:18.089]  No, go ahead.
[02:18:18.169 --> 02:18:24.953]  Scott Arms calls me and says, um, you ever go near the library again, I'll arrest you.
[02:18:25.478 --> 02:18:28.600]  So we ran this back and forth for about 60 seconds.
[02:18:28.780 --> 02:18:31.883]  And so it became a urination contest?
[02:18:32.163 --> 02:18:33.123]  Yes, it did.
[02:18:33.444 --> 02:18:34.044]  Absolutely.
[02:18:34.164 --> 02:18:37.166]  And I said, there's federal code.
[02:18:37.407 --> 02:18:39.108]  You have delusions of grandiosity.
[02:18:40.188 --> 02:18:49.475]  My United States Code in the Fourth Amendment allows me to enjoy peaceful habitation without illegal search and seizure.
[02:18:49.635 --> 02:18:50.576]  You don't forget that.
[02:18:51.843 --> 02:18:55.965]  And so we screened this back and forth for about 60, 70 seconds.
[02:18:56.005 --> 02:18:56.625]  He hangs up.
[02:18:57.186 --> 02:19:09.051]  Within two minutes, he and another husky officer stormed my apartment, ran me through the floor, to the floor, ran my head up and down several times to take me outside.
[02:19:09.431 --> 02:19:13.553]  Now, by now, I'm dizzy and severely bruised.
[02:19:14.593 --> 02:19:18.335]  And... General was saying you had a split head or did that happen next?
[02:19:18.855 --> 02:19:19.496]  I passed out.
[02:19:19.656 --> 02:19:20.076]  I fainted.
[02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:26.192]  Just as they were about to tip my head into the back of the patrol vehicle, I passed out.
[02:19:26.272 --> 02:19:36.136]  It was like 19, 20 degrees outside and I saw huge white lights, which were probably the police officer's lights.
[02:19:37.337 --> 02:19:44.820]  And we woke up to these huge lights and a man saying, you're in a pool of blood, stay still.
[02:19:46.308 --> 02:19:50.432]  And the ambulance came and then I was four hours in the emergency room.
[02:19:50.592 --> 02:19:52.113]  And of course, they never stopped there though.
[02:19:52.153 --> 02:19:55.596]  Not only did you get beat up, then they got to throw some charges on you to protect themselves.
[02:19:55.936 --> 02:19:56.117]  Yep.
[02:19:56.417 --> 02:19:56.657]  Yep.
[02:19:57.077 --> 02:19:58.379]  Tell us about that when we get back.
[02:19:58.419 --> 02:19:59.059]  We got a break.
[02:19:59.459 --> 02:20:03.683]  And then I want to ask for folks in the area to help you in any way they can.
[02:20:03.743 --> 02:20:06.065]  But this is how it works.
[02:20:07.186 --> 02:20:08.347]  This is how they operate.
[02:20:09.468 --> 02:20:10.829]  And that's why I advise people
[02:20:11.494 --> 02:20:14.759]  When the cops call, do not talk to them, and then get in your car and leave.
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:21.009]  It's better to not have confrontations with them, because, well, it's like with Kelly Rushing.
[02:20:21.029 --> 02:20:23.814]  They think Ron Paul giving a speech is illegal.
[02:20:24.495 --> 02:20:25.076]  He'll be right back.
[02:20:29.978 --> 02:20:33.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:20:33.301 --> 02:20:38.224]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:20:38.485 --> 02:20:42.828]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:20:43.148 --> 02:20:52.055]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:20:52.255 --> 02:20:55.878]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:20:56.158 --> 02:21:01.202]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:21:01.482 --> 02:21:08.168]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:21:08.689 --> 02:21:09.350]  What about you?
[02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:15.355]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:21:29.602 --> 02:21:32.023]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:32.063 --> 02:21:42.529]  Did you know that President Kennedy signed into law State Department Publication 7277 entitled, The United States Program for Complete and General Disarmament in a Peaceful World?
[02:21:42.609 --> 02:21:47.791]  This would disarm America and turn all of our armed forces over to the United Nations Organization.
[02:21:48.552 --> 02:21:53.014]  Citizens would be required to turn in their guns guaranteed to them by the Second Amendment.
[02:21:53.698 --> 02:21:59.361]  The head of the United Nations forces that would control all arms would always be a communist by agreement.
[02:22:00.161 --> 02:22:08.166]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:22:08.446 --> 02:22:09.946]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-UNITED.
[02:22:11.543 --> 02:22:22.172]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6 That's 1-800-5-1-6-8-7-3-6 Call now.

[02:22:31.439 --> 02:22:33.801]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:22:36.269 --> 02:22:41.093]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:22:41.313 --> 02:22:44.035]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:22:44.095 --> 02:22:45.196]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:22:46.537 --> 02:22:51.141]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:22:52.062 --> 02:22:59.328]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:23:00.328 --> 02:23:03.371]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:23:05.521 --> 02:23:08.984]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:23:09.965 --> 02:23:11.206]  Call for your copy today.
[02:23:11.486 --> 02:23:13.688]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:23:14.769 --> 02:23:20.594]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:23:21.315 --> 02:23:21.715]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:23:21.755 --> 02:23:21.956]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:29.099 --> 02:23:33.124]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:23:33.344 --> 02:23:36.748]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:23:36.928 --> 02:23:40.432]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:23:40.675 --> 02:23:43.916]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:23:43.936 --> 02:23:49.399]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:23:49.439 --> 02:23:59.063]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for a regular job a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:23:59.203 --> 02:24:00.484]  It's a well thought out formula.
[02:24:00.524 --> 02:24:05.986]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:24:06.391 --> 02:24:10.913]  If you'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:24:10.993 --> 02:24:12.373]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:24:12.533 --> 02:24:16.915]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:24:17.075 --> 02:24:18.495]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:24:44.269 --> 02:24:47.553]  Tell the folks up on, make the way to fly.
[02:24:54.911 --> 02:24:55.592]  Welcome back.
[02:24:55.712 --> 02:25:00.816]  We do have her letter now up on JonesReport.com.
[02:25:00.856 --> 02:25:02.297]  Dorita Cogent, Focus.
[02:25:02.377 --> 02:25:05.479]  Well spoken on the war on 9-11.
[02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:33.314]  Shirley Anderson gave a copy to the library, which she dropped back by to say, hey, why don't you guys put the videos I've given you, you know, there for people for free, which is normal.
[02:25:33.334 --> 02:25:34.774]  You're supposed to donate stuff to the library.
[02:25:35.515 --> 02:25:42.658]  And then they got her contact info and name off a letter to the editor and just dropped by as a secret police dude, you know, to see if they could snoop something up.
[02:25:42.698 --> 02:25:47.721]  And then, I guess, shooting her mouth off and talking back to people who think their God was a big mistake.
[02:25:47.761 --> 02:25:51.122]  So what did they then try to charge you with?
[02:25:51.162 --> 02:25:53.083]  And this just happened a few weeks ago.
[02:25:53.123 --> 02:25:54.004]  Where is this right now?
[02:25:57.733 --> 02:26:00.376]  Phone harassment was dismissed.
[02:26:00.896 --> 02:26:14.689]  The district court judge stated that the prosecutor met none of the parameters in order to charge me with that and I was still charged with resisting arrest.
[02:26:15.217 --> 02:26:16.158]  I'm 5'3", Alex.
[02:26:16.318 --> 02:26:17.178]  Oh, I know.
[02:26:17.198 --> 02:26:19.360]  You get the beat down and then you get to go to prison for it.
[02:26:19.700 --> 02:26:20.360]  Yeah, right.
[02:26:20.700 --> 02:26:22.241]  You know, I'm 5'3".
[02:26:22.261 --> 02:26:24.583]  I am no longer 35 years old.
[02:26:24.643 --> 02:26:24.763]  I'm 57.
[02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:28.365]  And I still think I'm 35.
[02:26:28.425 --> 02:26:31.227]  Well, let's get down to brass tacks.
[02:26:31.287 --> 02:26:33.108]  I mean, they just grabbed... I mean, did you resist them?
[02:26:34.171 --> 02:26:34.652]  No!
[02:26:35.132 --> 02:26:36.453]  How could I resist them?
[02:26:36.593 --> 02:26:37.534]  I'm a little person.
[02:26:37.834 --> 02:26:43.318]  Well, I don't get why they beat you up and then charge you, but that seems to be the favorite thing to do.
[02:26:43.338 --> 02:26:47.181]  Are you going to demand a jury trial and tell the story of how all this happened?
[02:26:47.601 --> 02:27:01.552]  Well, I'm not sure that's going to be a good thing because I live in a tiny village that is what, and I'm not, I hope I can say this on the air, I call it generationally sociopolitically incestuous.
[02:27:02.572 --> 02:27:05.333]  In that they all wash each other's back.
[02:27:05.413 --> 02:27:05.953]  You know what?
[02:27:06.073 --> 02:27:07.153]  I got your back, Jack.
[02:27:07.373 --> 02:27:10.554]  Yeah, it'll be the cop's father and brother on the jury.
[02:27:10.874 --> 02:27:11.154]  Yeah.
[02:27:11.334 --> 02:27:14.355]  So, I mean, have you talked to this police officer who's ruining your life?
[02:27:14.375 --> 02:27:18.036]  I mean, is he proud of... I mean, how many stitches did you get in your head?
[02:27:19.156 --> 02:27:19.877]  They were staples.
[02:27:19.897 --> 02:27:23.017]  I believe there were seven staples, but I'm not sure.
[02:27:24.058 --> 02:27:25.258]  And so when do you go to court?
[02:27:26.158 --> 02:27:28.779]  January 31st for resisting arrest.
[02:27:30.436 --> 02:27:33.338]  And is that going to be in Colville, or is that going to be in the county seat?
[02:27:33.358 --> 02:27:35.179]  That's going to be in Colville.
[02:27:37.781 --> 02:27:43.944]  Well, do you want to give out your contact info for anybody in the area that wants to try to come to the court and support you?
[02:27:45.265 --> 02:27:45.645]  Sure.
[02:27:45.705 --> 02:27:48.907]  Do you want to do that by webpage, or do you want me to do it on the air?
[02:27:49.247 --> 02:27:53.530]  Well, I mean, if it's okay, we'll put the number up on the letter to the editor you wrote.
[02:27:54.771 --> 02:27:55.611]  Okay, sure.
[02:27:55.651 --> 02:27:56.552]  Go ahead and do that.
[02:27:56.652 --> 02:27:57.492]  Is that what you want?
[02:27:57.933 --> 02:27:58.293]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:58.994 --> 02:28:02.937]  Okay, and I just, it's so sad.
[02:28:02.957 --> 02:28:07.621]  I mean, with Kelly rushing, they didn't even beat him up and then charge him.
[02:28:07.641 --> 02:28:10.703]  They just said it's illegal to give tapes of Congress to people.
[02:28:11.444 --> 02:28:13.986]  I mean, that's how crazy these people are.
[02:28:14.026 --> 02:28:19.250]  They watch Jack Bauer on TV every day, and they think everybody's a secret agent fighting Al-Qaeda.
[02:28:19.791 --> 02:28:23.874]  They call for my arrest on a routine basis, and I'm too big of a... Oh, I know.
[02:28:24.014 --> 02:28:25.695]  I watched, when I watched you
[02:28:28.217 --> 02:28:35.120]  Being ever so compliant with the bobbies in Great Britain, you know, I couldn't believe how they were treating you as a criminal.
[02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:37.340]  For videotaping, yeah.
[02:28:37.380 --> 02:28:37.841]  Yeah.
[02:28:37.961 --> 02:28:38.701]  Yeah, that's freedom.
[02:28:39.021 --> 02:28:41.802]  Well, I mean, this is a new darkness that's setting upon us.
[02:28:41.862 --> 02:28:42.682]  It is criminal!
[02:28:43.383 --> 02:28:45.323]  I have a quick quote.
[02:28:45.623 --> 02:28:47.004]  Do you have time for it?
[02:28:47.064 --> 02:28:47.624]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:28:48.504 --> 02:28:50.145]  Okay, this is from A.E.
[02:28:50.785 --> 02:28:51.806]  German, Ph.D.
[02:28:51.926 --> 02:28:55.287]  et al., Introduction to Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice.
[02:28:56.033 --> 02:29:00.875]  It's a very old dusty book I found in a library, copyright sometime in the 1960s.
[02:29:00.915 --> 02:29:02.295]  Yeah, go ahead and read it.
[02:29:03.256 --> 02:29:11.939]  In general, an accurate barometer engaging the moral tone of a community is a criminal justice system.
[02:29:12.820 --> 02:29:21.623]  If graft, demony, nepotism, and corruption are accepted phenomena throughout the social, governmental, educational,
[02:29:22.378 --> 02:29:26.420]  And religious groupings then so too in the criminal justice system.
[02:29:27.180 --> 02:29:34.303]  Organized crime is dedicated to subverting the most cherished attributes of a free society.
[02:29:35.203 --> 02:29:40.725]  As their leaders pursue their racketeering in open and clear defiance of the law.
[02:29:41.706 --> 02:29:44.787]  They preach a sermon that all too many Americans eat.
[02:29:45.547 --> 02:29:46.968]  The government is for sale.
[02:29:47.731 --> 02:29:51.757]  Morality is for suckers and honesty a pitfall.
[02:29:52.278 --> 02:29:53.640]  Wow, you need to send me a copy of that.
[02:29:53.680 --> 02:30:01.852]  What it boils down to is they decide that you're uppity and shouldn't be shooting your mouth off and you're a traitor, so let's get her!
[02:30:02.660 --> 02:30:03.480]  And they do!
[02:30:03.500 --> 02:30:08.601]  And the thing is, Alex... You shouldn't have come around our town, lady!
[02:30:08.941 --> 02:30:13.562]  The thing is, is that we're trying to protect... Stay there!
[02:30:13.622 --> 02:30:14.342]  Stay there!
[02:30:14.382 --> 02:30:15.503]  We're gonna get her!
[02:30:15.763 --> 02:30:16.843]  We got her!
[02:30:20.464 --> 02:30:21.404]  We're on the march.
[02:30:21.864 --> 02:30:23.484]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:24.384 --> 02:30:27.105]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:30.365 --> 02:30:31.965]  The statistics are heart-wrenching.
[02:30:32.285 --> 02:30:40.887]  According to the CWC, of the 43 million people who have served in the major wars, from the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, 3 million never made it home alive.
[02:30:41.228 --> 02:30:46.989]  Most likely, each one of us can say we either knew someone who served, or know a brave soul who is currently serving our country.
[02:30:47.369 --> 02:30:54.811]  Now there is a unique way to pay tribute to the courageous men and women who spend their lives protecting our freedom, and to those who have lost their lives doing so.
[02:30:55.131 --> 02:30:56.391]  Davis Products is operating
[02:30:56.391 --> 02:30:56.711]  I think so.
[02:31:11.519 --> 02:31:14.260]  What better way to pay homage to our enlisted loved ones?

[02:33:44.248 --> 02:33:49.292]  I've known James Panik and his wife, I'd call us a little more than acquaintances.
[02:33:49.312 --> 02:33:50.213]  They're not good friends.
[02:33:50.233 --> 02:34:00.662]  I mean, I've been to swim and pool with them, and been to a carnival with them, and through some mutual friends, and I've been to a few parties, a few dinners with his wife, with my wife.
[02:34:01.733 --> 02:34:03.955]  And we'll tell you the story of them in the CPS.
[02:34:04.556 --> 02:34:07.479]  Don't ever look far afield for FEMA camps and CPS stories.
[02:34:07.859 --> 02:34:09.240]  It's going on right here where I live.
[02:34:09.261 --> 02:34:10.642]  That's how bad this stuff's gotten.
[02:34:11.042 --> 02:34:14.566]  We're going to briefly tell you that story in a minute, and I appreciate James holding.
[02:34:14.586 --> 02:34:16.508]  Let's go back to Shirley Anderson.
[02:34:16.548 --> 02:34:17.829]  Shirley, folks are going to call you.
[02:34:17.849 --> 02:34:18.870]  They're going to offer to help you.
[02:34:20.043 --> 02:34:23.965]  The key here is, you can show that they were harassing you.
[02:34:24.105 --> 02:34:28.046]  You can show that they're not getting you for any original crime to be there.
[02:34:28.566 --> 02:34:31.928]  They show up, they harass you, they claim your suicide light of the blue.
[02:34:32.288 --> 02:34:39.971]  They come in and assault you, and to cover the assault charge, they lay this assault charge on you for resisting arrest.
[02:34:41.031 --> 02:34:42.992]  And it's just outrageous.
[02:34:44.313 --> 02:34:46.153]  Any other ways people can help you?
[02:34:48.610 --> 02:34:51.272]  I mean, number one, you reap what you sow.
[02:34:51.372 --> 02:34:56.175]  I hope the librarian and the cop know, they don't have to fear you, or me, or anybody else.
[02:34:56.455 --> 02:34:57.495]  They need to fear God.
[02:34:57.515 --> 02:35:04.940]  Because bearing false witness, even if it's delusional, you know, concocting, you know, that, well, we just think you're evil because you don't like the government.
[02:35:06.226 --> 02:35:08.487]  I mean, I believe in the laws of the universe and God's laws.
[02:35:08.527 --> 02:35:17.812]  These people that do this kind of stuff and go after women and children, it's just, they are really in a lot of trouble in God's creation, I'll tell you.
[02:35:18.553 --> 02:35:20.153]  But it's just really sad.
[02:35:21.274 --> 02:35:22.855]  But anything else you want to add about this?
[02:35:23.455 --> 02:35:29.118]  I could use some real fellow patriots in my life, and that was what I was about.
[02:35:30.169 --> 02:35:31.189]  When this happened.
[02:35:31.430 --> 02:35:32.850]  Yeah, you were trying to do a letter to the editor.
[02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:34.291]  You were trying to give them some free videos.
[02:35:34.311 --> 02:35:35.731]  You were just talking to people.
[02:35:35.751 --> 02:35:36.612]  You're not supposed to do that.
[02:35:36.632 --> 02:35:37.932]  You're supposed to watch your television.
[02:35:38.272 --> 02:35:39.353]  You're supposed to drool.
[02:35:39.913 --> 02:35:45.735]  You're supposed to believe all the propaganda and take your flu shot every year with five times the safe level of mercury.
[02:35:46.155 --> 02:35:48.056]  And you're supposed to eat your radiated meat.
[02:35:48.096 --> 02:35:50.137]  And you're supposed to just, you know, just be an idiot.
[02:35:51.077 --> 02:35:51.278]  Yeah.
[02:35:52.678 --> 02:35:59.621]  And we are in offense to the global mind control.
[02:36:00.793 --> 02:36:04.615]  Mind Control has existed since the 40s in the United States.
[02:36:04.695 --> 02:36:05.736]  It will continue to exist.
[02:36:05.836 --> 02:36:11.959]  Well, that is mass brainwashing and mind control that they would think that because she wrote a letter to the editor.
[02:36:12.019 --> 02:36:14.300]  She tried to give anti-government videos.
[02:36:15.061 --> 02:36:20.083]  And she doesn't like it that somebody called us out because they think she's crazy.
[02:36:20.103 --> 02:36:21.104]  Well, let's go get her.
[02:36:21.924 --> 02:36:25.386]  And it's a shame, but we'll follow this case.
[02:36:25.866 --> 02:36:28.788]  Well, I have one quick thing to say if you have enough time.
[02:36:30.509 --> 02:36:55.674]  Milton William Cooper, before he was gunned down seven weeks after the Twin Towers, warned us in his book, Behold a Pale Horse, the title, of course, extracted from Revelation 6, that anyone who acts in God's family country will be considered a mental case
[02:36:56.808 --> 02:36:59.149]  And we'll be put in one of these FEMA camps?
[02:36:59.349 --> 02:37:00.629]  Well, that's what they're trying to do.
[02:37:00.649 --> 02:37:01.629]  We're not going to put up with it.
[02:37:01.689 --> 02:37:13.291]  I mean, take the little young man, now 11, just turned 11, was 10 at Steiner Elementary out in Lake Travis, outside Austin.
[02:37:13.871 --> 02:37:22.473]  And they admitted, I have the report, the disciplinary report, it said he visited InfoWars.com, he was called a terrorist at the front of the class,
[02:37:23.455 --> 02:37:26.260]  Uh, and they want him to have psychiatric evaluation.
[02:37:26.961 --> 02:37:31.510]  And, uh, they suspended him for visiting InfoWars.com.
[02:37:32.171 --> 02:37:34.035]  Damage, tried to damage him for life.
[02:37:35.467 --> 02:37:36.588]  Well, they're not going to succeed.
[02:37:37.169 --> 02:37:37.469]  Amen.
[02:37:37.689 --> 02:37:39.571]  And young people just need to keep their mouths shut.
[02:37:39.991 --> 02:37:42.114]  They need people to get out of these government training camps.
[02:37:42.154 --> 02:37:46.958]  Listen, folks need to get in contact with these locals and let them know that I appreciate it.
[02:37:47.499 --> 02:37:49.140]  They need to support you.
[02:37:49.220 --> 02:37:50.742]  They need to be there to be court watchers.
[02:37:51.222 --> 02:37:54.185]  And we'll follow your case and let them know nationally it's being followed.
[02:37:55.186 --> 02:37:57.008]  God bless and keep in touch with us.
[02:37:57.428 --> 02:37:58.750]  I've enjoyed my time with you.
[02:37:59.090 --> 02:37:59.931]  Thank you for coming on.
[02:38:01.306 --> 02:38:02.987]  And folks, we're getting these reports every day.
[02:38:03.027 --> 02:38:05.508]  I mean, there's no way to cover them all or vet them all.
[02:38:05.528 --> 02:38:10.089]  We did vet this one, and we vetted what happened out at Steiner Middle School, uh, Elementary, excuse me.
[02:38:10.669 --> 02:38:14.491]  And we did vet what happened to Kelly Rushing, and... I mean, you see it in the news.
[02:38:14.551 --> 02:38:17.792]  Man puts a sign in the yard saying, Judicial System of Joke is Arrested.
[02:38:18.252 --> 02:38:20.013]  They think it's Nazi Germany.
[02:38:20.433 --> 02:38:21.933]  They think it's the Soviet Union.
[02:38:22.794 --> 02:38:28.896]  Now, just to illustrate how CPS can get involved in your life... These are people I know.
[02:38:29.841 --> 02:38:30.762]  They don't drink.
[02:38:31.002 --> 02:38:32.223]  They don't take drugs.
[02:38:32.263 --> 02:38:33.184]  They don't do any of this.
[02:38:33.304 --> 02:38:33.824]  I know them.
[02:38:35.245 --> 02:38:36.806]  And James Panik is a teetotaler.
[02:38:38.047 --> 02:38:42.210]  And I've known them for, I guess, about 8 years, off and on.
[02:38:43.331 --> 02:38:44.832]  And they call up here to the office.
[02:38:46.073 --> 02:38:50.876]  And months ago, they called their daughter in, 11 years old.
[02:38:53.661 --> 02:39:05.668]  Without telling her why at the school, without a disciplinary action, and they had a camera running, a CPS worker, a male, an 11-year-old girl, and he interrogated her about, you know, did mommy and daddy use drugs?
[02:39:06.628 --> 02:39:12.892]  And this is because a tattletale neighbor saw the mother with bloodshot eyes.
[02:39:13.512 --> 02:39:19.035]  Now, I've got a bloodshot eye right now from allergies, and that's what she had going on.
[02:39:19.969 --> 02:39:21.470]  And this is the country, folks.
[02:39:21.490 --> 02:39:23.471]  There's illegal aliens running around all around us.
[02:39:23.812 --> 02:39:27.654]  They don't have to show ID, again, to get a bank account or a housing loan.
[02:39:28.195 --> 02:39:31.297]  There's government criminality, almost $4 trillion missing from the Pentagon.
[02:39:31.697 --> 02:39:33.939]  All sorts of corruption run absolutely rampant.
[02:39:35.660 --> 02:39:37.081]  But all over the country, today,
[02:39:37.873 --> 02:39:41.996]  People off of the Tattletail Society are getting caught in this net.
[02:39:42.936 --> 02:39:44.978]  James, good to have you on with us.
[02:39:45.158 --> 02:39:46.318]  I haven't talked to you yet today.
[02:39:46.339 --> 02:39:47.019]  I talked to you last night.
[02:39:47.339 --> 02:39:55.965]  You tried to go into the school today to get the report on what was really going on with your daughter, and you're pulling her out of the government training camp and putting her in another school.
[02:39:56.025 --> 02:39:56.945]  That's the right move.
[02:39:57.826 --> 02:40:01.088]  But just in a nutshell, like our last guest did, tell us what happened.
[02:40:01.408 --> 02:40:02.809]  Tell us what you've now learned today.
[02:40:03.810 --> 02:40:04.850]  Well, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:40:04.950 --> 02:40:07.152]  I'm grateful to you and your listeners for your time.
[02:40:08.281 --> 02:40:13.286]  Um, this morning didn't really, uh, it was pretty uneventful.
[02:40:13.506 --> 02:40:15.567]  I got the cold shoulder from absolutely everyone.
[02:40:15.608 --> 02:40:17.929]  It was a madhouse because it was the first day of school.
[02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:26.397]  And, um, basically I withdrew her from that school and, um, couldn't really get any information from anybody this morning.
[02:40:26.617 --> 02:40:27.578]  And, and that's okay.
[02:40:28.238 --> 02:40:29.760]  It, there was no, uh, scene.
[02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:30.700]  There was no problems.
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:32.522]  I'm, I was grateful to get out of there.
[02:40:35.207 --> 02:40:40.930]  Uh, basically it's helping... No, no, no, but you went in there with the education code to show how you were supposed to be contacted.
[02:40:40.970 --> 02:40:41.630]  I mean, explain that.
[02:40:41.650 --> 02:40:42.991]  Well, just tell the whole story.
[02:40:43.011 --> 02:40:43.331]  Go ahead.
[02:40:44.491 --> 02:40:51.534]  Okay, basically, uh, October 16th, uh, my wife came down with conjunctivitis, which is just an eye infection.
[02:40:51.574 --> 02:40:52.475]  She went to the doctor.
[02:40:52.495 --> 02:40:55.236]  She got, uh, antibiotic for it.
[02:40:55.476 --> 02:40:57.137]  I mean, I've had pink eye before.
[02:40:57.197 --> 02:40:57.637]  Who hasn't?
[02:40:58.037 --> 02:40:58.957]  It's miserable, yeah.
[02:40:59.077 --> 02:41:00.278]  No, that means you're on drugs.
[02:41:00.338 --> 02:41:02.039]  You've got to have your children take it.
[02:41:02.159 --> 02:41:02.559]  Right, well...
[02:41:03.288 --> 02:41:06.551]  Anyway, the next day she informed me she felt like she was fine to drive.
[02:41:06.571 --> 02:41:07.292]  And I said, okay.
[02:41:07.312 --> 02:41:09.814]  So she drove our daughter to school.
[02:41:10.654 --> 02:41:21.524]  And somewhere along the line, either she made an erratic movement of some kind with the steering wheel or maybe she took a turn too sharply or not sharply enough or something.
[02:41:22.204 --> 02:41:25.307]  And someone called the police and reported a drunk driver.
[02:41:25.867 --> 02:41:29.791]  So the police caught up with her and directly smack dab in front of the school.
[02:41:30.658 --> 02:41:39.623]  And of course, they were both mortified to... Both my daughter and my wife were mortified when the police showed up and started basically shaking down.
[02:41:39.643 --> 02:41:41.805]  By the way, this is the new thing.
[02:41:41.905 --> 02:41:52.151]  You do any move or anything, my uncle was driving along, doesn't drink or anything, and they thought that, you know, they pulled him over and said, somebody said you were drunk driving.
[02:41:52.191 --> 02:41:54.132]  This is just a police state, but go ahead.
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:10.878]  Well, uh, they allowed her to go into her school, uh, very magnanimous of them, uh, magnanimously let her do this, and she, uh, went into school in tears, and, uh... So basically there's a scene, the parents must be bad, let's get the kid.
[02:42:11.761 --> 02:42:18.424]  Well, I mean, if you're just pulling up and all you see is someone being, you know, shaken down in front of the school, you're going to think, well, what's going on here, you know?
[02:42:19.065 --> 02:42:22.607]  And of course, children are children and they can be very mean.
[02:42:23.327 --> 02:42:28.389]  And so without lawyers, without anything, they now are trying to interrogate your daughter to get something on you.
[02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:29.110]  Tell that.
[02:42:31.946 --> 02:42:37.728]  Basically, the police could not find anything, uh, the matter with my wife, except for the fact that her eyes were red.
[02:42:38.248 --> 02:42:41.610]  So they let her go, and I'll give you the rest of that story some other time.
[02:42:42.130 --> 02:42:52.413]  But, um, uh, someone, and we don't know who, but an 11-year-old, let's say, uh, alluded to the fact that Sherry must have been on speed.
[02:42:52.433 --> 02:42:56.495]  And, um, this word got to the principal.
[02:42:57.449 --> 02:42:59.391]  So, uh... See, everything's a witch hunt now.
[02:42:59.451 --> 02:43:06.176]  Just all these little Jack Bauer 11-year-olds, 80-year-olds, 20-year-olds just running around Jack Bauer-ing everything.
[02:43:06.496 --> 02:43:07.997]  Got a spy, got a tattle.
[02:43:08.818 --> 02:43:09.818]  Well, I thought it fascinating.
[02:43:09.858 --> 02:43:13.861]  I've been involved with drug and alcohol abuse rehabilitation for over 25 years.
[02:43:13.981 --> 02:43:20.286]  I don't consider myself an expert, but the school apparently considers an 11-year-old an expert on drug and alcohol abuse, clearly.
[02:43:20.847 --> 02:43:23.148]  So, um, a week later, uh,
[02:43:24.715 --> 02:43:26.763]  I hear from my daughter after school.
[02:43:27.145 --> 02:43:28.129]  She's very shaken.
[02:43:28.169 --> 02:43:29.615]  She's extremely upset.
[02:43:30.307 --> 02:43:33.868]  That they had called her out of class, uh, said, you know, please come to the office.
[02:43:34.669 --> 02:43:42.732]  And, um, she went to the office and, uh, they escorted her to the receptionist escorted her to the rooms in back of the offices.
[02:43:43.572 --> 02:43:48.174]  And, uh, she then escorted her into a room where there was a tall man.
[02:43:48.654 --> 02:43:50.835]  She said, he was about my size, I'm 6'2".
[02:43:51.715 --> 02:43:57.277]  Um, and, uh, despite the fact the receptionist left the door open, the CPS agent
[02:43:58.017 --> 02:44:00.680]  Uh, closed the door and began looking at my daughter.
[02:44:00.760 --> 02:44:02.522]  He didn't say anything, he just started looking at her.
[02:44:03.502 --> 02:44:12.851]  And, um, so anyway, uh, he asked her if she knew who he was.
[02:44:13.632 --> 02:44:18.496]  And she said, uh, maybe I know, you know, I think I have an idea who you are.
[02:44:19.076 --> 02:44:20.578]  And he says, do you know what I do?
[02:44:21.298 --> 02:44:22.319]  And of course she said no.
[02:44:22.840 --> 02:44:23.160]  So he...
[02:44:24.480 --> 02:44:27.502]  If the man had any parents, you would have any sense at all.
[02:44:27.822 --> 02:44:29.083]  First of all, you need to be polite.
[02:44:29.103 --> 02:44:31.084]  I mean, I'm not an Emily Post or an Amy Vanderbilt.
[02:44:31.104 --> 02:44:31.304]  No, no, no.
[02:44:31.324 --> 02:44:32.185]  We're all criminals.
[02:44:32.385 --> 02:44:34.326]  All children are to be interrogated.
[02:44:34.366 --> 02:44:36.768]  This is the new Soviet America.
[02:44:37.228 --> 02:44:41.310]  Okay, the schools are there to get children into the system by hook or by crook.
[02:44:41.731 --> 02:44:42.431]  Please continue.
[02:44:43.268 --> 02:44:47.191]  So he is now alone, in a room, with no one but my daughter.
[02:44:47.631 --> 02:44:54.435]  And because of that, the only reason he got into the school was because he had a business card that claimed he was from CPS.
[02:44:55.036 --> 02:44:58.518]  No one in the entire school had ever seen this man on the campus before.
[02:44:58.538 --> 02:45:00.839]  So he's a total stranger to everyone.
[02:45:00.859 --> 02:45:02.300]  He rides around in a brand new BMW.
[02:45:03.181 --> 02:45:05.702]  Yeah, because they're paid very well now.
[02:45:07.103 --> 02:45:11.066]  And he proceeds to interrogate her for about a half an hour and take pictures of her.
[02:45:12.109 --> 02:45:15.106]  And of course what really broke my heart was the fact that
[02:45:16.138 --> 02:45:23.520]  She was trying to apologize to me for not being able to get out of the situation in time, for allowing herself to be trapped.
[02:45:23.540 --> 02:45:24.960]  You have a really sweet little daughter.
[02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:25.860]  She is.
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:27.061]  She's extremely sweet.
[02:45:27.121 --> 02:45:32.482]  I remember back when my son was just a baby in arms, we went with your wife, my wife, and then your daughter.
[02:45:32.502 --> 02:45:34.062]  Your daughter was probably about 8 then.
[02:45:34.082 --> 02:45:35.423]  She's 11 now.
[02:45:35.463 --> 02:45:40.804]  We went to the fair and let them play games and stuff.
[02:45:40.824 --> 02:45:41.524]  We were very evil.
[02:45:41.564 --> 02:45:42.444]  Please continue.
[02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:49.535]  So anyway, I've been trying to reassure her that she did nothing wrong.
[02:45:49.575 --> 02:45:50.656]  There was nothing she could do.
[02:45:50.676 --> 02:45:51.598]  It was an ambush.
[02:45:51.738 --> 02:45:52.739]  And she's 11.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:57.526]  God knows how old this guy is.
[02:45:57.626 --> 02:45:58.747]  One thing has led to another.
[02:46:00.858 --> 02:46:14.728]  In essence, with no evidence whatsoever but an anonymous 11-year-old saying that my wife is on speed, we now have this guy breathing down our necks, this CPS agent, Ordner.
[02:46:14.948 --> 02:46:18.030]  Let's be clear, he also comes down and bangs on your door at your house?
[02:46:18.730 --> 02:46:19.711]  Well, that was later.
[02:46:19.811 --> 02:46:24.474]  The first thing that happened, of course, was I was far too angry to deal with him, so I hired a lawyer.
[02:46:24.594 --> 02:46:26.075]  I mean, it was the only thing I could really do.
[02:46:26.435 --> 02:46:31.398]  There was no way I could face a man who did this to my daughter and control myself, I felt.
[02:46:32.879 --> 02:46:41.104]  So I hired a lawyer, and I left word, the lawyer also left word, that he must not have anything to do with me or my family.
[02:46:41.224 --> 02:46:43.666]  If he has any questions, he needs to contact my lawyer.
[02:46:44.326 --> 02:46:45.307]  Two months go by.
[02:46:45.447 --> 02:46:46.928]  He never calls, nothing.
[02:46:48.684 --> 02:46:58.768]  Then, on the 28th, which of course is on their Christmas break, he, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, just walks up to the house and starts pounding on the door.
[02:46:59.489 --> 02:47:02.750]  And I was not there, I was at work, but... Well, this is America.
[02:47:03.450 --> 02:47:07.212]  Secret police, the school doesn't even know who he is, they won't tell you.
[02:47:07.312 --> 02:47:08.353]  This is a nice neighborhood.
[02:47:08.393 --> 02:47:08.833]  Sure, yeah.
[02:47:11.494 --> 02:47:16.819]  So he's pounding on the door, and of course, you know, they both know, uh, he'd never answer the door.
[02:47:16.859 --> 02:47:26.347]  So they were quiet, they waited until he went away, and he left a pretty nasty note on the door, saying, you have one day to contact me, or I'm calling the DA's office in on this.
[02:47:26.488 --> 02:47:28.069]  And that really is a terroristic threat.
[02:47:28.109 --> 02:47:33.334]  Police can't come and threaten, you better meet with me or I'll charge you with something, or I'll get somebody to charge.
[02:47:33.354 --> 02:47:35.736]  I mean, that's just all color of law intimidation.
[02:47:36.156 --> 02:47:38.277]  Well, not to mention the fact that he has no jurisdiction.
[02:47:38.337 --> 02:47:41.859]  I mean, I read the entire family code of Texas this weekend.
[02:47:41.939 --> 02:47:42.780]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:47:42.840 --> 02:47:43.580]  Who is this guy?
[02:47:43.600 --> 02:47:44.581]  Who does he really work for?
[02:47:44.601 --> 02:47:51.304]  To the best of my knowledge, Mr. Ordner does work for CPS.
[02:47:52.185 --> 02:47:54.786]  CPS of what jurisdiction?
[02:47:55.807 --> 02:47:56.447]  Of Austin.
[02:47:58.028 --> 02:47:59.009]  Travis County, I'm sorry.
[02:47:59.349 --> 02:48:00.930]  Travis County, which is Austin.
[02:48:00.950 --> 02:48:03.091]  And the school your daughter was attending?
[02:48:04.212 --> 02:48:06.774]  Well, it's Lake Travis Middle School.
[02:48:07.714 --> 02:48:09.415]  So that's an upper middle class area.
[02:48:09.876 --> 02:48:10.196]  Sure.
[02:48:10.356 --> 02:48:11.317]  Out by Lake Travis.
[02:48:11.357 --> 02:48:13.118]  I really call it Nuevo Reach.
[02:48:15.319 --> 02:48:21.363]  And so you're out there and he's saying you better call him or else.
[02:48:21.503 --> 02:48:21.883]  Okay.
[02:48:23.524 --> 02:48:23.844]  Yeah.
[02:48:23.924 --> 02:48:31.069]  So in essence, I called my lawyer and said he'd done this and my lawyer called and had a conversation with him.
[02:48:32.854 --> 02:48:36.517]  Uh, I just don't want, I don't agree with letting someone into my house.
[02:48:36.537 --> 02:48:37.217]  I mean, this is the same thing.
[02:48:37.237 --> 02:48:37.918]  That's what they do.
[02:48:38.078 --> 02:48:44.742]  Without a warrant, with nothing, they just get their way in, see dog hair or something on the ground, and then, really, you're in deep trouble then.
[02:48:44.762 --> 02:48:48.344]  Uh, you know this Ordner's first name?
[02:48:48.364 --> 02:48:49.845]  Yes, Tom.
[02:48:51.927 --> 02:48:53.168]  Tom Ordner.
[02:48:53.428 --> 02:48:53.768]  Alright.
[02:48:55.954 --> 02:48:57.134]  So where does it go from here?
[02:48:57.495 --> 02:49:01.516]  I mean, number one, I'm not going to chastise you, but no one should have their child in a government camp.
[02:49:01.976 --> 02:49:07.117]  These things are designed, designed to get your children into the system, sir.
[02:49:07.738 --> 02:49:08.358]  Well, of course.
[02:49:08.458 --> 02:49:14.640]  And if I had the financial wherewithal to do something different, believe me, I would, but I don't.
[02:49:16.760 --> 02:49:21.902]  And so anyway, we're now stuck with
[02:49:23.360 --> 02:49:27.722]  You know, again, as you were saying before, kind of a urination contest, so we'll see who wins.
[02:49:27.822 --> 02:49:43.151]  But basically, he has no jurisdiction as far as I'm concerned, and from what I've read, he's already broken section 261.001 A, B, D, E, F, H, and I. And tell folks what that states.
[02:49:44.271 --> 02:49:48.354]  Well, basically, it's under the heading of child protection.
[02:49:48.714 --> 02:49:51.035]  Actually, I'm sorry, it's called protecting the children.
[02:49:51.944 --> 02:50:05.314]  And it's all about keeping them safe, and disallowing, certainly not allowing strangers to just march in and harm them, and harass them, and terrorize them.
[02:50:05.374 --> 02:50:13.881]  And yet, here's a man who no one's ever seen before, who simply walks into the school, says, here I am, let me see this kid, they give her, you know, just turn her over.
[02:50:13.921 --> 02:50:21.026]  Let me tell you something, I know, and I always say middle class families, because it's really bad for the poor who can't defend themselves,
[02:50:22.137 --> 02:50:26.541]  I mean, I hear about it every few weeks from my wife, from other children that my children are friends with.
[02:50:26.561 --> 02:50:32.506]  I mean, these are at nicer swim places, gyms, playgroups.
[02:50:33.046 --> 02:50:37.730]  These are people that write for major newspapers, magazines, lawyers, scientists.
[02:50:38.565 --> 02:50:49.487]  Every time a child jumps off a jungle gym, and this happened to everybody I know, it happened to me, it happened to my mother, you break a finger, you break a foot, there could be 50 witnesses how it happened, boom, CPS hits you, hits you hard.
[02:50:50.028 --> 02:50:51.668]  Tries to take your kid, or takes him.
[02:50:52.528 --> 02:50:54.508]  Now, you mean, and everybody gets hurt, folks.
[02:50:54.528 --> 02:50:55.089]  Who out there didn't?
[02:50:55.109 --> 02:50:56.189]  I mean, now they're everywhere.
[02:50:56.649 --> 02:50:59.470]  You just, thank God your child didn't fall off a jungle gym.
[02:51:00.450 --> 02:51:05.991]  The only place they're safe to fall off a jungle gym is school, but you better record it then, or they'll claim it happened the next day at your house.
[02:51:06.730 --> 02:51:07.631]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:51:32.848 --> 02:51:36.031]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:51:36.392 --> 02:51:38.314]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:38.674 --> 02:51:46.322]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:47.003 --> 02:51:54.045]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:54.466 --> 02:52:05.849]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House probe to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:06.190 --> 02:52:09.691]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:10.151 --> 02:52:12.072]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:12.412 --> 02:52:16.253]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:29.392 --> 02:52:34.476]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:52:34.536 --> 02:52:41.841]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:52:42.001 --> 02:52:52.609]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:52:52.829 --> 02:52:57.372]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:52:57.652 --> 02:53:02.637]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:53:02.857 --> 02:53:05.799]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:53:06.020 --> 02:53:15.748]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than 2 cents per gallon.

[02:54:23.639 --> 02:54:32.626]  By the way, this school, Lake Travis, just lost a big lawsuit over doing this with other children.
[02:54:52.947 --> 02:54:54.889]  And I mean, it's just hell on earth in the poor schools.
[02:54:55.629 --> 02:54:59.873]  And he's gotten his daughter back out of that school and has her in a magnet school because she's a real good student.
[02:55:01.454 --> 02:55:05.337]  And he's now got another lawyer, and I'm telling you, the terroristic threat route's the way to go.
[02:55:05.817 --> 02:55:09.640]  And now you say you've got a lawyer who says it is a good case and is going to go after him?
[02:55:10.561 --> 02:55:13.523]  Well, he says they have no case, period.
[02:55:13.583 --> 02:55:14.144]  Which they don't.
[02:55:14.484 --> 02:55:16.546]  You need to go on the offensive first.
[02:55:17.106 --> 02:55:18.167]  You need to go ahead and litigate.
[02:55:21.182 --> 02:55:23.224]  I'm not a lawyer, so I'm letting him handle it.
[02:55:24.044 --> 02:55:27.025]  We'll see where he takes it and how far he takes it and all that kind of stuff.
[02:55:27.045 --> 02:55:32.308]  Yeah, but putting that note on your door saying, you talk to me or I'm going to the DA... Oh, absolutely.
[02:55:32.608 --> 02:55:34.329]  If a cop did that, they'd get in a bunch of trouble.
[02:55:34.369 --> 02:55:35.310]  You don't do that.
[02:55:35.730 --> 02:55:36.891]  Well, these people are rogues.
[02:55:37.211 --> 02:55:43.774]  They operate as if they are completely above the law and, you know, with impunity.
[02:55:43.794 --> 02:55:49.237]  They can do anything they want, which is absolutely incorrect, and I look forward to correcting him on that.
[02:55:50.052 --> 02:55:54.395]  And, you know, if there's anything I can tell all the parents out there, I meant to put this in earlier when we were talking.
[02:55:55.996 --> 02:56:03.882]  I hate to say this, but tell your kids, not jokingly, not under your breath, not in any way, shape, or form, ever mention three things.
[02:56:04.082 --> 02:56:06.044]  Sex, drugs, or weapons in school.
[02:56:06.104 --> 02:56:06.584]  I'm telling you.
[02:56:06.945 --> 02:56:07.965]  Don't even joke about it.
[02:56:08.265 --> 02:56:09.586]  Because this could happen to you.
[02:56:10.607 --> 02:56:15.571]  And it's terrible we have to do that, but if you're going to have your kid in a school,
[02:56:17.086 --> 02:56:17.487]  Warn them.
[02:56:17.867 --> 02:56:18.567]  Simply warn them.
[02:56:18.687 --> 02:56:22.829]  Because there are plenty of predators out there that our tax dollars are paying for to come get them.
[02:56:22.969 --> 02:56:26.391]  Well, I don't know this guy from Adam, and he might be a nice guy, I just misguided, but I know this.
[02:56:27.011 --> 02:56:30.012]  Statistically, the system's five times more likely to hurt children.
[02:56:30.392 --> 02:56:33.054]  So there's no worse group for children than CPS.
[02:56:33.074 --> 02:56:33.834]  And that's just a fact.
[02:56:34.134 --> 02:56:35.535]  Cover of Time Magazine.
[02:56:35.555 --> 02:56:36.755]  Or was it Newsweek?
[02:56:36.775 --> 02:56:38.636]  The Shame of Foster Care, like six years ago.
[02:56:38.656 --> 02:56:40.737]  You know, that's the national numbers.
[02:56:41.537 --> 02:56:43.558]  And we're all in danger because of this.
[02:56:43.778 --> 02:56:44.979]  And it's an industry.
[02:56:45.914 --> 02:56:50.996]  And it's just so sad to see this happening to your family.
[02:56:51.476 --> 02:56:53.736]  But I would just get on the offensive.
[02:56:53.836 --> 02:56:56.477]  I would file a complaint with his superiors.
[02:56:58.058 --> 02:57:01.859]  Because what will happen is it may escalate on his end.
[02:57:02.379 --> 02:57:05.260]  It's important that you engage him first.
[02:57:06.156 --> 02:57:08.818]  Uh, before something gets trumped up on you.
[02:57:09.138 --> 02:57:10.779]  Of course, and establish a paper trail.
[02:57:10.799 --> 02:57:11.959]  It's all about paper.
[02:57:12.419 --> 02:57:13.500]  Well, I mean, is it?
[02:57:13.700 --> 02:57:15.261]  Now, now, this school just lost a suit.
[02:57:15.281 --> 02:57:16.302]  Tell folks briefly about that.
[02:57:16.322 --> 02:57:16.922]  We're out of time.
[02:57:17.142 --> 02:57:22.325]  You know, honestly, I don't have, I don't really have a lot of details on it, uh, and, um... You just sell it in the paper?
[02:57:22.925 --> 02:57:29.513]  Yes, it was in the paper, and it was... this statement covered it briefly, and... I remember seeing a blurb.
[02:57:29.913 --> 02:57:37.222]  Yeah, I mean, you know, like they do anything, you get half a paragraph on something, and it's unintelligible, but that's how the paper works.
[02:57:39.448 --> 02:57:41.430]  So this guy refuses to talk to your lawyer.
[02:57:41.490 --> 02:57:43.072]  He wants to interrogate you guys.
[02:57:43.092 --> 02:57:44.194]  He wants to get in the house.
[02:57:44.514 --> 02:57:45.255]  Well, that's how they do it.
[02:57:45.275 --> 02:57:47.778]  I've talked to several other parents who've been through this exact same thing.
[02:57:47.818 --> 02:57:54.606]  And they say, no, all you have to do is just come to our office and they'll find some neutral location and just show up.
[02:57:55.146 --> 02:58:00.750]  We're just going to have a chat, and boom, they take the kids, they throw them in handcuffs, they drag them off, they dress them in orange.
[02:58:00.830 --> 02:58:03.192]  A friend of mine's 10-year-old was dressed in orange.
[02:58:03.212 --> 02:58:04.633]  Then they get the psychiatrist with them.
[02:58:04.653 --> 02:58:05.874]  We'll let you see Mommy.
[02:58:05.934 --> 02:58:07.235]  Just tell us what we want to hear.
[02:58:07.255 --> 02:58:08.276]  You get the whole deal.
[02:58:08.316 --> 02:58:09.076]  And that's another thing.
[02:58:09.097 --> 02:58:12.579]  Tell your kids, do not talk to the people at the school.
[02:58:12.619 --> 02:58:13.860]  They'll have a nice little psychology period.
[02:58:13.880 --> 02:58:16.062]  No, you have to teach them not to trust uniforms.
[02:58:16.802 --> 02:58:18.483]  Not to trust anybody in government.
[02:58:18.503 --> 02:58:19.784]  That's what the Founding Fathers said.
[02:58:20.204 --> 02:58:20.764]  And it's the truth.
[02:58:21.064 --> 02:58:22.065]  Hey, James.
[02:58:22.145 --> 02:58:22.405]  Panic.
[02:58:22.425 --> 02:58:23.025]  Good talking to you.
[02:58:23.065 --> 02:58:23.786]  Say hi to your wife.
[02:58:24.106 --> 02:58:25.146]  Say hi to your daughter for me.
[02:58:25.266 --> 02:58:28.328]  And I hope to run into you again sometime through our mutual friends.
[02:58:28.728 --> 02:58:29.168]  Absolutely.
[02:58:29.208 --> 02:58:30.189]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:58:30.549 --> 02:58:33.370]  And call in if this guy does anything else.
[02:58:34.171 --> 02:58:34.711]  I will do this.
[02:58:35.051 --> 02:58:35.472]  Thank you.
[02:58:35.792 --> 02:58:36.352]  Thank you, sir.
[02:58:36.592 --> 02:58:37.012]  You bet.
[02:58:37.372 --> 02:58:46.237]  From FEMA camps to people being SWAT teamed and arrested for handing out videos to just everything else we're here covering with a client of the Republic.
[02:58:47.248 --> 02:58:58.557]  The new industry isn't making cars or computers, it's just bureaucrats, and SWAT teams, and cameras, and checkpoints, and open borders, and trillions missing from the Pentagon, and just wallowing in evil.
[02:58:59.698 --> 02:59:03.020]  And, uh, back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:59:03.080 --> 02:59:03.761]  Please support us.
[02:59:04.061 --> 02:59:06.403]  Visit the online video and bookstore at infowars.com.
[02:59:06.803 --> 02:59:07.424]  Alright, take care.

[02:59:21.021 --> 02:59:21.942]  Good morning, honey.
[02:59:22.302 --> 02:59:28.328]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:59:28.569 --> 02:59:29.189]  Yeah.
[02:59:29.570 --> 02:59:30.991]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:59:31.351 --> 02:59:34.755]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:59:35.235 --> 02:59:36.717]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:59:37.177 --> 02:59:38.879]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:59:39.259 --> 02:59:41.021]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:59:41.201 --> 02:59:42.123]  Honey, cheer up!
[02:59:42.504 --> 02:59:44.789]  I brought our Spark Berkey Purifiers!
[02:59:45.029 --> 02:59:45.370]  What?
[02:59:45.771 --> 02:59:51.323]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals, or fat.
