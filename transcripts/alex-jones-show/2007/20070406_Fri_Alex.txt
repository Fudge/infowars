[00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:05.910]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:07.612]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.333 --> 00:00:09.474]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.114 --> 00:00:10.915]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:12.657]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.237 --> 00:00:16.901]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:21.525]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.228 --> 00:01:01.327]  I've been so focused on 9-11 Truth exploding and the upwards of 10 different national attacks daily on national television against 9-11 Truth, Rosie O'Donnell, Charlie Sheen, and all of us that know the truth about September 11th, whether you be liberal, conservative, or whether you've shattered that paradigm and are a constitutionalist who simply wants freedom and liberty and is not buying the propaganda
[00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:11.683]  I've been so busy covering all that that I was looking through the stacks of news, some of which are pretty much untouched here in front of me, that I never got to this week.
[00:01:12.264 --> 00:01:21.031]  And so I want to at least mention these stories that have a serious import to your liberty and freedom and to the human condition.
[00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:30.278]  Coming up in the next three hours, we're also going to have wide open telephones and we have a special guest joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:32.885 --> 00:01:47.265]  Obviously, it's interesting news that a bizarre hexagon shape was photographed by a satellite on the North Pole of Saturn, and that gets into
[00:01:48.268 --> 00:01:53.329]  Quantum mechanics and dimensional theory and Einstein actually predicted that.
[00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.310]  And I remember seeing a PBS program about 15 years ago showing a previous satellite that went over Saturn showing it.
[00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.331]  They were claiming that it was brand new news, just broke, brand new photos.
[00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.252]  That was last week.
[00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:08.112]  Never got to it.
[00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:08.972]  It's here on the stack.
[00:02:09.572 --> 00:02:14.393]  That cruise ship that sunk there in the
[00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:16.875]  Mediterranean.
[00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:20.738]  That's very interesting news, but I'm not going to get into it.
[00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:21.759]  It's interesting.
[00:02:21.779 --> 00:02:22.980]  I mean, I find it interesting.
[00:02:23.761 --> 00:02:28.786]  It runs into some volcanic rocks or volcanic reef and sinks, and two people were missing.
[00:02:28.846 --> 00:02:29.927]  It was a big cruise ship.
[00:02:31.428 --> 00:02:40.276]  I mean, there's all these things that are happening, but I stay focused on, and it's a big wide area, on things that actually affect us.
[00:02:40.356 --> 00:02:40.817]  Things that
[00:02:42.888 --> 00:02:48.949]  Deal with the overlords that are quite psychotic and that are in control of our society.
[00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:52.490]  And here's a story from yesterday I never got to that we'll be covering.
[00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.131]  Drug dispensing tooth could be controlled by cell phone.
[00:02:58.151 --> 00:02:59.351]  Now, why is this important?
[00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:03.052]  Well, we'll get into why that's important to our liberties and freedoms.
[00:03:03.532 --> 00:03:06.993]  Drug dispensing tooth could be controlled by cell phone.
[00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:24.310]  Speaking about the release a few days ago of the British commandos, they now admit they were on an intelligence-gathering mission and have spun that, and they have not recanted the fact that they were in Iranian waters.
[00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.954]  Now, you better believe that the government could get them to come out and say that they lied.
[00:03:30.014 --> 00:03:30.774]  They would.
[00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:33.156]  Why aren't they doing that?
[00:03:34.648 --> 00:03:38.450]  And again, even questioning things is anti-patriotic.
[00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:54.357]  You just must believe everything your government says, especially when they're grabbing your neighbor's three-year-old, and the neighbor's screaming and crying, and there's no warrant and no due process, you should just let the child disappear into the rape rooms of your state.
[00:03:54.377 --> 00:03:57.018]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.520]  But it's unpatriotic to question government
[00:04:01.152 --> 00:04:02.413]  The government is God.
[00:04:02.453 --> 00:04:03.794]  We're here to serve the government.
[00:04:03.814 --> 00:04:05.955]  That's what America is all about.
[00:04:06.115 --> 00:04:11.598]  Serving and worshipping and showing proper respect to your government owners and leaders.
[00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.721]  Who've been bought and paid for by foreign corporations.
[00:04:16.921 --> 00:04:18.282]  So we'll go into that report here.
[00:04:18.622 --> 00:04:24.526]  Also, 13-year-old arrested in school for writing OK on the desk.
[00:04:26.627 --> 00:04:27.207]  That's right.
[00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:29.769]  Wrote OK on the desk.
[00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:32.823]  Another report here.
[00:04:34.544 --> 00:04:35.704]  Al-Qaeda's back.
[00:04:35.784 --> 00:04:39.285]  Expect bin Laden to be popping up any day now.
[00:04:40.746 --> 00:04:44.507]  The FCC says they seek to reform 9-11 cell phone tracking.
[00:04:45.947 --> 00:04:48.088]  Got a bunch of audio clips I want to play.
[00:04:49.008 --> 00:04:52.909]  And old big brother had a farm, E-I-I-D-O.
[00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.930]  Britain could stage another September 11th attack.
[00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.351]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:57.391 --> 00:04:57.831]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.036 --> 00:05:09.481]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:17.449]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:25.225]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:37.052]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.372 --> 00:05:40.875]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.335 --> 00:05:43.256]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:47.439]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:03.706 --> 00:06:06.507]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.767 --> 00:06:10.929]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:12.190]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.052]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.552 --> 00:06:19.674]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:34.869]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:41.976]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.316 --> 00:06:46.718]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:47.158 --> 00:06:48.939]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:49.179]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:50.780]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:01.215 --> 00:07:03.617]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.137 --> 00:07:07.440]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.762]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:07:11.043 --> 00:07:17.407]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:07:17.488 --> 00:07:21.891]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:26.493]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.255]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:07:29.275 --> 00:07:32.056]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:07:32.517 --> 00:07:35.058]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:07:35.098 --> 00:07:39.340]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.241]  Treasury bonds.
[00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:45.144]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:07:45.324 --> 00:07:46.965]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:46.985 --> 00:07:48.967]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:08:01.683 --> 00:08:03.866]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.446 --> 00:08:07.229]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:33.974 --> 00:08:50.644]  About a day and a half ago, or to be technical, late Wednesday night, we put up the DefendRosie.com, defend her free speech, even if you disagree with her on a lot of other issues, because there is a national campaign
[00:08:51.875 --> 00:09:07.824]  Every major TV news program in the nation that I've seen has been calling for her to be fired or calling her an un-American traitor for not blindly buying whatever the neocons who've been caught lying on every front have told us about 9-11.
[00:09:08.164 --> 00:09:13.307]  We're just suddenly supposed to believe all of that when the evidence shows they carried out the attacks.
[00:09:14.847 --> 00:09:16.168]  And yesterday I told you there were 21,000 signatures.
[00:09:16.188 --> 00:09:17.129]  That's because
[00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:26.773]  We had thousands and thousands of them in the system crash and then when it rebooted it malfunctioned and said 21,000.
[00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:32.695]  I know it's over 10,000 now because we've gone through and actually read them and have reposted them.
[00:09:32.915 --> 00:09:40.338]  Some of the ones that got shelved into the, you know, hinterland of cyberspace.
[00:09:41.359 --> 00:09:45.220]  So they're having to cut and paste and, you know, find all those comments.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.322]  We have them, but having to transfer them over into
[00:09:51.306 --> 00:09:59.388]  The DefendRosie.com website.
[00:10:00.089 --> 00:10:04.350]  And so I really do want to thank all of you that have gone to the site.
[00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:11.072]  And I want to thank all of you that have signed up there in support of free speech.
[00:10:11.132 --> 00:10:15.994]  In fact, I was reading through literally hundreds of them, scanning through them last night.
[00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:17.314]  It's been about 20 minutes in there.
[00:10:18.237 --> 00:10:23.179]  And I probably saw maybe one out of 60, 70 people that was against her.
[00:10:23.879 --> 00:10:34.362]  They were all cogent, intelligent, focused points of the thousand or so that I was able to look at that we did have up on the page.
[00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:45.366]  I haven't had time to mess with it this morning, but I'm told they've been able to salvage the, I don't know, 9,000 plus or so that had gone into
[00:10:46.874 --> 00:10:52.438]  Where to start with all of the news that is here in front of me because there is quite a bit of it that we need to go over
[00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:18.170]  Quite a bit of it that we need to go over.
[00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:25.354]  First off is drug dispensing tooth can be controlled by cell phone.
[00:11:26.595 --> 00:11:30.237]  And this came out of Local 6 News.
[00:11:31.798 --> 00:11:40.363]  If you just type drug dispensing tooth into a search engine, you'll see page after page of news articles about the drug dispensing tooth.
[00:11:41.388 --> 00:11:46.973]  But it says researchers in Europe and Israel are working on a tooth that can dispense medicine into a person's mouth.
[00:11:46.993 --> 00:11:58.063]  According to a Level 6 report, the tiny device could be able to release a specific amount of medicine at certain intervals, ensuring that the patient gets the proper dose at the right time, i.e.
[00:11:58.544 --> 00:12:00.446]  so you can't control it and so you're a slave.
[00:12:01.146 --> 00:12:06.211]  It's attached to your existing teeth and could one day be controlled by using your cell phone, the report said.
[00:12:07.125 --> 00:12:13.309]  And it says patients often forget or find it too inconvenient to take medicine, especially during the night.
[00:12:13.909 --> 00:12:20.853]  But a dentist told the Associated Press that the device would rectify that problem by automating the process.
[00:12:21.313 --> 00:12:31.279]  The actual drug dispensing system is called Inteledrug and would be small enough to fit in a replacement tooth placed in the back of the mouth like a molar.
[00:12:32.026 --> 00:12:34.927]  Wolf's Company, Saloel Ltd.
[00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:42.129]  and German Microelectronic Institutes are two of the 15 organizations involved in the development of the device.
[00:12:42.609 --> 00:12:49.211]  The report said the treatment of diabetes is also an area where delivering drugs via a tooth can be advantageous.
[00:12:50.057 --> 00:12:51.778]  Now again, this is just a technology.
[00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:52.519]  Sounds great.
[00:12:52.979 --> 00:12:53.780]  It's like a gun.
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.081]  I'm not against a gun.
[00:12:55.141 --> 00:13:01.886]  I don't demonize a handgun or a rifle or even a 100mm howitzer.
[00:13:03.387 --> 00:13:05.728]  But when it's misused, it can be bad.
[00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:12.333]  And they have Applied Digital, that's an IBM front company, military industrial complex front company.
[00:13:12.413 --> 00:13:13.234]  IBM really owns it.
[00:13:13.254 --> 00:13:16.436]  At least the last financial filing of theirs I read a few years ago said that.
[00:13:17.179 --> 00:13:24.729]  Like most companies out there that are technology, their front companies IBM are owned by them or funded by them or a majority of their shares are held by them.
[00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:26.130]  Just a side issue.
[00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:32.158]  And the other folks that brought you again, the numbers on the Jews in the camps.
[00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:39.176]  That was a International Business Machines number there that was entered into it, but oh, it's a good American company, good people.
[00:13:39.976 --> 00:13:42.458]  They're pioneering the Human Genome Project.
[00:13:42.478 --> 00:13:49.521]  They're pioneering, oh, traveling the world to do a global genome track of all of our roots.
[00:13:50.721 --> 00:13:55.844]  Oh, give your blood to IBM, as if they can't just go for people.
[00:13:57.156 --> 00:14:04.124]  34 and under to the semi-secret federal DNA database from that blood test they did when you were born?
[00:14:04.725 --> 00:14:05.826]  I had congressmen on.
[00:14:05.926 --> 00:14:06.467]  It's admitted.
[00:14:07.426 --> 00:14:08.807]  It's even been in the news a few times.
[00:14:09.367 --> 00:14:11.468]  It goes into a federal database.
[00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:15.531]  But for some reason, they're doing it with National Geographic.
[00:14:15.951 --> 00:14:19.353]  In other parts of the world, they don't have this yet, so it's not really focused here in the U.S.
[00:14:19.373 --> 00:14:24.836]  I mean, if you want to, quote, be part of the program, they'll take your blood as part of the PR.
[00:14:25.697 --> 00:14:29.799]  I'm sorry, I'm already digressing, ladies and gentlemen, here.
[00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:35.863]  But the point is, four years ago,
[00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:46.742]  They signed a contract with the Bureau of Prisons in California, Applied Digital did, and Reuters picked it up, and then once the news got out, the contract was cancelled.
[00:14:46.762 --> 00:14:52.424]  They were going to forcibly put chips in the Bureau of Prisons inmates.
[00:14:53.368 --> 00:15:05.150]  The prisoners are going to be made to take chips, just like Applied Digital greased the skids and got the Attorney General of Mexico to make his employees take the chip to get into the secure areas.
[00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:08.971]  You see, that's how this is going to work in the future, and they've said this.
[00:15:09.771 --> 00:15:14.432]  Oh, you don't have to have a chip, it's just to have this job, you've got to have it.
[00:15:14.652 --> 00:15:18.853]  Oh, you don't have to give a urine test just to have this job, you have to.
[00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:27.097]  Or, you don't have to take this tooth but to be insured by this medical provider and to get care at this hospital you do.
[00:15:27.477 --> 00:15:35.625]  Or, you don't have to have a chip put in your baby's belly button when they're born, which a bunch of hospitals are now doing, but to be in this hospital you do.
[00:15:36.126 --> 00:15:42.071]  Oh, and our insurance provider has made a consortium deal with 96% of the providers in our state.
[00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:47.274]  And, oh, the regulators are shutting down those other hospitals.
[00:15:47.774 --> 00:15:51.055]  See, that's how it already works, and this is how it will work in the future.
[00:15:52.355 --> 00:16:07.679]  You wonder why you can be in London, or you can be in Chicago, or Los Angeles, or Tokyo, and you go in now, even in London in many areas, where, you know, in the past you could buy beer when you were five years old, you go in to buy cigarettes or beer, and they will card 85-year-old people.
[00:16:09.395 --> 00:16:21.117]  I mean, folks, I've seen people, literally, who are one step away from a walker, 75, in bad health, 80, 85, could be older, being carded by zit-faced kids behind the counter.
[00:16:22.177 --> 00:16:26.138]  And again, first it was we card if you look under 30, now we card everybody.
[00:16:26.678 --> 00:16:28.279]  And then now they swipe your card.
[00:16:28.299 --> 00:16:31.919]  And oh, now you can pay for your gas with your card.
[00:16:31.939 --> 00:16:33.380]  Remember last year?
[00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.480]  Oh, there's a scam nationally.
[00:16:37.054 --> 00:16:38.195]  There's a scam!
[00:16:38.275 --> 00:16:53.809]  We don't know how people discovered it, but you're able to pay for your gas, and the system accepts your driver's license and gives you a receipt, and one gas station, before they found out, cost tens of thousands of dollars, and it's happening all over the greater Milwaukee area.
[00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:56.071]  It's happening all over the greater New York area.
[00:16:56.351 --> 00:16:57.552]  It's happening in Florida.
[00:16:57.852 --> 00:16:59.134]  We don't know how people learned.
[00:16:59.594 --> 00:17:04.038]  Employees at data companies involved in this learned, and they told friends about it.
[00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:21.433]  And then sure enough, they've now announced on national news and local news, oh you can now pay, you can now pay, isn't it wonderful, for your gas with your, with your national ID card.
[00:17:21.453 --> 00:17:23.613]  They don't tell you that, they say with your driver's license.
[00:17:24.174 --> 00:17:27.954]  You just gotta sign up, it's a quick registration and then it debits it out of your account.
[00:17:28.874 --> 00:17:32.015]  In Finland, more than ten years ago, I learned of it ten years ago,
[00:17:33.152 --> 00:17:35.833]  I was told by a Finn about it, who was in Austin.
[00:17:36.293 --> 00:17:44.636]  Then I was told about it by one of my other associates, a writer for Infowars, Ed Homan, who had been to Finland and done IT work there.
[00:17:45.336 --> 00:17:46.696]  He worked for Compaq at the time.
[00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:51.458]  And then, I guess about six or seven years ago, lo and behold, there it was in the news.
[00:17:51.838 --> 00:17:54.859]  It was a big article about Finland, how great it was.
[00:17:55.675 --> 00:18:03.497]  And it was how, if you say make a million dollars a year, your parking ticket is bigger, your speeding ticket is bigger, your taxes are higher.
[00:18:03.978 --> 00:18:11.640]  Your bank account has to be held in a government account, and then it automatically debits everything out of your account.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:24.644]  And there was another news report about every cell phone call is listened to and recorded, every who you call is recorded, there's cameras on the buses, the street corners, and the Finns, and I'm not knocking Finns, they're nice people once they've been
[00:18:25.469 --> 00:18:27.810]  I mean, they don't talk, folks.
[00:18:52.458 --> 00:19:17.043]  and uh... so it's a perfect automatons and and this is what you've got and this is what they're setting up and this is the model okay and then in the reports i saw said that that foreign governments were studying this and that and that finland was the test model that this is what we're going to have here and then now you see england they have four plus million cameras in london alone tens of millions nationwide and now
[00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:20.080]  Three years ago, they put in telescreens.
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:24.802]  It's little screens with a camera and a voice shouting at you.
[00:19:26.343 --> 00:19:28.964]  If your walk looks suspicious, it'll go ahead and talk to you.
[00:19:29.544 --> 00:19:31.665]  Now they're adding children's voices.
[00:19:31.725 --> 00:19:33.226]  In fact, I think I sent a clip to the network.
[00:19:33.286 --> 00:19:34.146]  It's an example of this.
[00:19:34.566 --> 00:19:36.847]  And it's like, hello, we're watching you.
[00:19:37.347 --> 00:19:40.709]  Everything's all right, but don't drop that piece of paper now.
[00:19:41.609 --> 00:19:44.050]  And imagine the creepiness of it, you see.
[00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:46.091]  It's just all creepy.
[00:19:48.875 --> 00:19:51.796]  Don't worry, they'll graduate to a voice going, listen to me.
[00:19:53.237 --> 00:19:56.838]  I mean, I've seen SWAT teams in Miami that actually wear devil masks, folks.
[00:19:57.699 --> 00:19:58.679]  It's gonna be hellish.
[00:19:58.699 --> 00:19:59.279]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.142 --> 00:20:04.204]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:04.824 --> 00:20:13.752]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.192 --> 00:20:21.398]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.111 --> 00:20:27.617]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.097 --> 00:20:38.928]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:39.689 --> 00:20:41.691]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:45.075 --> 00:20:45.415]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:02.503 --> 00:21:04.364]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[00:21:04.384 --> 00:21:04.865]  It's April 6, 2007.
[00:21:05.165 --> 00:21:05.725]  Gold is at $674.20.
[00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:07.327]  And one ounce gold coins can be purchased for $697.88.
[00:21:07.367 --> 00:21:08.928]  $351.49 for half ounce and $175 for quarter ounce coins.
[00:21:08.948 --> 00:21:09.228]  That's $697.88, $351.49 and $175.75.
[00:21:20.496 --> 00:21:24.078]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:24.138 --> 00:21:27.160]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:36.325]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is spiraling out of control.
[00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:41.948]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:21:42.388 --> 00:21:44.689]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:21:44.749 --> 00:21:47.169]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:21:47.569 --> 00:21:50.830]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.571]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:54.651 --> 00:21:54.912]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.952 --> 00:21:55.132]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:07.434]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:07.774 --> 00:22:11.858]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:12.158 --> 00:22:12.698]  We listened.
[00:22:12.999 --> 00:22:18.003]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:18.263 --> 00:22:18.764]  We listened.
[00:22:19.144 --> 00:22:22.166]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:23.147]  We listened.
[00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:27.511]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:28.532]  We're good to go.
[00:22:44.014 --> 00:22:46.636]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[00:22:46.856 --> 00:22:47.057]  Only $279.
[00:22:47.117 --> 00:22:47.697]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:47.737 --> 00:22:47.977]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:48.037 --> 00:22:49.378]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:49.398 --> 00:22:50.139]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:00.576 --> 00:23:07.084]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:11.329]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:23:11.589 --> 00:23:13.751]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:23:14.092 --> 00:23:21.080]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.042]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:27.825]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:23:28.085 --> 00:23:31.007]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:23:31.287 --> 00:23:35.971]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:23:36.351 --> 00:23:37.852]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:23:38.132 --> 00:23:41.555]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X.
[00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:42.475]  We're good to go.
[00:24:05.453 --> 00:24:07.555]  I'm just ranting today, but I do that most days.
[00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:13.299]  Just to watch a huge cage, a high-tech surveillance grid being designed to control, corral, track
[00:24:31.633 --> 00:24:37.975]  Oppress the people and then to know that the cage is being built by literal psychopathic killers.
[00:24:38.755 --> 00:24:43.116]  Actual psychopathic killers are running things.
[00:24:43.156 --> 00:24:47.937]  They have brainwashed mindless police and government bureaucrats that work for them.
[00:24:48.577 --> 00:24:56.099]  More and more of them are waking up but it's kind of a race because the grid is going to be in place soon and a lot of it's going to be automated and it really won't matter.
[00:24:57.239 --> 00:24:59.240]  And so I just sit here trying to warn people
[00:24:59.835 --> 00:25:08.966]  Let's go ahead and play this little clip concerning the new medicated tooth that will be activated by cell phone and give you the medicine you need.
[00:25:09.986 --> 00:25:11.826]  Now forget popping a pill.
[00:25:11.966 --> 00:25:13.907]  Let your teeth medicate you.
[00:25:14.107 --> 00:25:17.328]  That's what engineers say could be the future and they're working on it right now.
[00:25:17.688 --> 00:25:21.909]  Israeli and European researchers have come up with a drug dispensing tooth.
[00:25:22.569 --> 00:25:25.910]  The device can release your specific dose at different intervals.
[00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:32.351]  It would be attached to your existing teeth and could one day even be controlled by using your cell phone.
[00:25:33.166 --> 00:25:39.830]  Okay, so let's break down what's happening with the cell phones because that's the key piece of equipment that nexuses all of this in.
[00:25:52.179 --> 00:25:56.582]  You know, you're being told you'll get your radio, you'll get your TV, and it's already been happening for a couple years.
[00:25:57.043 --> 00:25:58.704]  You'll get everything over your cell phone.
[00:25:58.724 --> 00:25:59.804]  It'll be your computer.
[00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:01.746]  It'll be your PC.
[00:26:01.906 --> 00:26:19.959]  It will nexus in to your home PC or to your laptop, which will also have your television and your video games, and it'll all know your eating habits, and it'll automatically order your food if you want it, and automatically pay your bills, and it'll automatically dispense the drugs.
[00:26:21.224 --> 00:26:35.867]  And by federal law, since 1996 is when they put in the NSA snooping hubs into every major phone company, the cell towers have to triangulate you down to 15 feet.
[00:26:37.288 --> 00:26:39.828]  Now they're putting out propaganda now going, it's terrible!
[00:26:39.888 --> 00:26:43.429]  In some areas of the country, it can only triangulate you down to a mile.
[00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.450]  And that's if you're outside cell phone area.
[00:26:48.492 --> 00:26:54.935]  But if you're inside a city or in surrounding areas, it's down to really about 3 feet on average, but the law says 15 feet.
[00:26:55.395 --> 00:27:02.198]  And then by federal law, it also dials in when the phone is off, if there is any battery power, you don't see the phone light up.
[00:27:02.218 --> 00:27:04.879]  But by law, it's built in that it not light up.
[00:27:04.939 --> 00:27:08.200]  It's built in for surveillance, and they listen to you.
[00:27:09.081 --> 00:27:11.722]  And you're saying, well, do they have the personnel to have people listening?
[00:27:11.802 --> 00:27:11.962]  No.
[00:27:12.854 --> 00:27:18.757]  AI, NSA computers, but mainly, and now leased out to private corporations, are taking over everything.
[00:27:19.297 --> 00:27:33.324]  Do you understand, folks, the waterways, the roads, the coal mines, the coal plants, the power plants, the reservoirs, the water, everything, I mean everything, is being handed over to foreign interest, and they didn't pay for it.
[00:27:33.944 --> 00:27:35.005]  That's globalization.
[00:27:35.757 --> 00:27:39.918]  They come in and lobby your politicians, and it's not even pennies on the dollar.
[00:27:40.039 --> 00:27:43.560]  I mean, in some of these deals, it's pennies on the million.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:50.862]  I'm talking, I've seen the ratios where they might spend a million dollars to get a billion out of it.
[00:27:52.183 --> 00:27:56.624]  I mean, we're talking about ratios here that are just off the charts.
[00:27:56.704 --> 00:28:01.726]  I mean, they come give a governor a hundred grand, and they get two hundred plus billion in roads.
[00:28:02.384 --> 00:28:03.765]  Over the next 75 years.
[00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:06.866]  I mean, we're talking about numbers off the charts.
[00:28:06.966 --> 00:28:09.347]  It is a fire sale.
[00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:11.288]  Shields are down.
[00:28:11.428 --> 00:28:20.411]  Economically, ladies and gentlemen, it's like our shields dropped and they're just sitting there firing at will, blasting us end-to-end.
[00:28:20.511 --> 00:28:22.452]  Explosions, fire, shooting out.
[00:28:22.512 --> 00:28:22.732]  Okay?
[00:28:22.932 --> 00:28:24.353]  Can you picture that right now?
[00:28:24.673 --> 00:28:30.115]  But in the scheme of time, here in the next few years, and again the explosions have been going on for a couple before this,
[00:28:30.755 --> 00:28:32.595]  That's just a few seconds in the scheme of history.
[00:28:32.795 --> 00:28:40.257]  I mean, we're blowing up, right now, with just gouts of flame and molten steel, blasting out of Fortress America.
[00:28:41.597 --> 00:28:47.439]  And there's idiot cops running around, writing everybody tickets, and then being ordered to let the illegal aliens drive right past them.
[00:28:48.319 --> 00:28:49.199]  Publicly.
[00:28:49.699 --> 00:28:52.460]  I mean, this is how it is a comp... So, fine!
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:57.061]  To all the yuppies and all the cops and all of you that serve the system, fine!
[00:28:57.481 --> 00:28:58.041]  Fine!
[00:28:58.321 --> 00:28:58.861]  Okay!
[00:29:00.086 --> 00:29:01.867]  Cut your nose off despite your face.
[00:29:02.247 --> 00:29:03.148]  Don't listen to me.
[00:29:03.648 --> 00:29:04.309]  Laugh at me.
[00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:09.212]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, they're taking everything over.
[00:29:10.272 --> 00:29:10.873]  Everything.
[00:29:12.894 --> 00:29:14.215]  I've never seen anything like it.
[00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:16.076]  I mean, it is so bad.
[00:29:16.096 --> 00:29:18.838]  And there's all these reports spinning.
[00:29:19.278 --> 00:29:24.101]  What's happening with subprime mortgages and arms adjustable rate.
[00:29:24.745 --> 00:29:25.285]  Mortgages?
[00:29:25.686 --> 00:29:25.946]  You know what?
[00:29:25.966 --> 00:29:27.087]  I'm going to talk about those a little bit.
[00:29:27.107 --> 00:29:27.887]  They're in my stack.
[00:29:27.927 --> 00:29:30.109]  BBC, Associated Press.
[00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:32.790]  All spinning it, of course.
[00:29:32.911 --> 00:29:34.251]  All spinning it, as usual.
[00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:36.293]  And we're going to take some calls.
[00:29:36.333 --> 00:29:38.094]  And I've got new 9-11 news.
[00:29:38.194 --> 00:29:39.515]  And there's so much.
[00:29:39.555 --> 00:29:43.958]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:29:44.718 --> 00:29:46.219]  And here we are on the Titanic.
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:47.841]  The USS Titanic.
[00:29:55.189 --> 00:29:57.971]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.073 --> 00:30:07.738]  Thus says Yahweh, if you will not keep my commandments by violating my covenant, I will bring upon you sudden terror!
[00:30:11.613 --> 00:30:14.775]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:30:15.015 --> 00:30:18.698]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:30:18.958 --> 00:30:26.923]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:41.313]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[00:30:41.713 --> 00:30:44.775]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.

[00:30:55.082 --> 00:30:59.065]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[00:31:00.931 --> 00:31:01.511]  It's a fact.
[00:31:01.711 --> 00:31:06.154]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:31:06.494 --> 00:31:11.696]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:31:11.976 --> 00:31:15.178]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[00:31:15.418 --> 00:31:22.561]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:31:22.901 --> 00:31:30.065]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:31:30.325 --> 00:31:32.426]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[00:31:32.827 --> 00:31:39.171]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[00:31:39.391 --> 00:31:43.194]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[00:31:43.534 --> 00:31:46.096]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.

[00:31:49.378 --> 00:31:50.819]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:32:01.806 --> 00:32:03.027]  This is Elizabeth Border.

[00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:10.911]  Hard-hitting?
[00:32:11.252 --> 00:32:14.213]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[00:32:14.534 --> 00:32:15.754]  War in Iran?
[00:32:16.275 --> 00:32:17.916]  A coming One World Church?
[00:32:18.676 --> 00:32:23.979]  In the first issue is included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[00:33:39.973 --> 00:33:41.074]  We have nowhere to run.
[00:33:41.094 --> 00:33:45.536]  Our backs are against the wall.
[00:33:47.137 --> 00:33:48.678]  And there's one thing we can do.
[00:33:50.099 --> 00:33:53.461]  And one thing only.
[00:33:53.641 --> 00:33:54.421]  And that's fight.
[00:33:54.481 --> 00:33:59.544]  You're not gonna lay there and let them chew your guts out, are ya?
[00:33:59.944 --> 00:34:04.927]  You're not gonna lay there and let these hyenas have their way with you, are ya?
[00:34:04.967 --> 00:34:05.948]  Pick up a club!
[00:34:07.577 --> 00:34:09.698]  Get fired up and go at their heads!
[00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:16.020]  I'll be honest with you.
[00:34:17.701 --> 00:34:18.742]  If I could punch out.
[00:34:20.002 --> 00:34:21.503]  If I could get to a new world.
[00:34:22.483 --> 00:34:25.804]  If I could evacuate and know that for my life and for my children's lives.
[00:34:27.585 --> 00:34:32.947]  And I could work in a factory ladies and gentlemen and just have a quiet small home and live in peace.
[00:34:33.808 --> 00:34:37.109]  Without criminals everywhere running the system, feeding on people.
[00:34:38.095 --> 00:34:45.140]  I would leave this country, I would evacuate as our forefathers, many of your forefathers did, to come to this new land.
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.461]  There's nowhere to run.
[00:34:47.821 --> 00:35:06.373]  It's worse in many other countries, but it's going to get really bad here, and much of the evil emanates out of Fortress America, out of New York, out of London, out of Tel Aviv, out of Germany, out of France, out of Moscow, out of Tokyo, out of Beijing, out of Peking.
[00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:14.373]  There was a point I wanted to make when I wanted to go to these loaded phone lines.
[00:35:14.513 --> 00:35:16.495]  I take a lot of calls on this Friday, maybe.
[00:35:16.515 --> 00:35:17.656]  I always say that.
[00:35:17.676 --> 00:35:18.957]  There's just so much information.
[00:35:18.977 --> 00:35:22.320]  There was a really important point that I wanted to make.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:23.041]  Ah, yes.
[00:35:27.085 --> 00:35:29.487]  Let me just break this down slowly and succinctly.
[00:35:32.350 --> 00:35:35.613]  The dollar is being devalued by design.
[00:35:38.692 --> 00:35:51.237]  So that in the final phase of global consolidation, so that the United States and its assets can be fully extracted.
[00:35:52.497 --> 00:35:54.978]  And by fully, I mean you're talking like 90 plus percent.
[00:35:56.299 --> 00:35:59.580]  It's hard to get all the assets, but they're getting darn close.
[00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:03.562]  And when you get 90 percent plus, you got it all.
[00:36:03.602 --> 00:36:04.242]  You got control.
[00:36:05.422 --> 00:36:11.084]  And then it's just a mopping up exercise to get the rest of your wealth, which they will dig out of you.
[00:36:11.824 --> 00:36:21.147]  So sit there and smile, you slack-jawed good old boy who thinks he's now a member of the elite who just, you know, but you know who I'm talking about.
[00:36:22.127 --> 00:36:27.949]  Just keep your smiley face going there because it's going to get wiped off your fat mouth, okay?
[00:36:27.969 --> 00:36:31.930]  Because I'm more disgusted with you than anybody else because you think
[00:36:33.007 --> 00:36:36.729]  There's people like you that if you would have gotten involved we could have saved this country.
[00:36:36.769 --> 00:36:38.489]  But, alright, I said I'd make it simple.
[00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:39.810]  I'm digressing.
[00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:42.291]  I'm going to start imaging these people.
[00:36:48.654 --> 00:36:51.995]  Their denial, their weakness, just everything.
[00:36:52.355 --> 00:36:53.156]  Everything they are.
[00:36:53.196 --> 00:36:53.976]  It disgusts me.
[00:36:56.037 --> 00:36:56.957]  But let's go back here.
[00:36:58.758 --> 00:37:00.339]  I'll tell you what, let's just start at this first.
[00:37:00.379 --> 00:37:01.319]  Let's start at the beginning.
[00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:03.937]  This nation has never been perfect.
[00:37:04.437 --> 00:37:08.018]  This nation's had a lot of problems, and a lot of abuse, and a lot of oppression.
[00:37:08.118 --> 00:37:15.541]  But, compared to other countries, and compared to other empires, and compared to other societies, we are the best.
[00:37:16.681 --> 00:37:18.682]  The West is the best.
[00:37:21.222 --> 00:37:22.863]  Take the King's Highway.
[00:37:25.064 --> 00:37:26.364]  The West is the best.
[00:37:27.585 --> 00:37:28.545]  It has been the best.
[00:37:30.043 --> 00:37:41.553]  And a lot of that is because civilization came to the West earlier than it came to a lot of other societies and races of man.
[00:37:45.716 --> 00:37:49.059]  And there was great native intelligence in Ice Age man.
[00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:52.742]  You know what?
[00:37:52.782 --> 00:37:53.983]  Maybe I'm going back too far.
[00:37:55.704 --> 00:37:58.647]  The point is that the West
[00:37:59.628 --> 00:38:17.759]  has had a lot of problems but it's also developed some things you didn't see anywhere else and because of the greatest expression of that and greatest manifestation of that with what we saw in 1776 and the formation of the nation in 1787 and 1789 because you had
[00:38:28.351 --> 00:38:39.218]  The closest thing you can get to a vibrant, growing middle class, a hyper-Renaissance, and an ability to run from government as it tried to manifest westward.
[00:38:39.258 --> 00:38:43.780]  And again, there were abuses to those in the aboriginal population that ran into that.
[00:38:44.101 --> 00:38:45.441]  But the point is, it was unique.
[00:38:46.122 --> 00:38:51.125]  And so, 4% of the world's population had more than half the world's wealth.
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:39:00.883]  And then by the 1960s it was half the world's wealth, and then it has rapidly been debased down to now a fraction of what it once was.
[00:39:01.224 --> 00:39:20.391]  And it literally laid the engine of that wealth, was the generation of that wealth, and it was a feedback loop, and a self-replicating energy dynamo, a fount, a great fount of gouts of life and ideas and inventions,
[00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:23.828]  We're talking 95% of world inventions.
[00:39:23.868 --> 00:39:30.912]  We're talking about the smartest, most educated people, the most aggressive people, the most violent people, the most powerful people.
[00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:42.838]  You know, a hybrid of the West infused with the native aboriginal cultures and infused with the dynamic, fittest of the fit Africans.
[00:39:43.399 --> 00:39:44.839]  That was America.
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.721]  The best of the best.
[00:39:49.696 --> 00:39:55.661]  And so, an incredible dynamo of wealth and ideas.
[00:39:56.782 --> 00:40:16.639]  And, I mean, when you read open discussions in the Parliament, and open discussions in England and France, and banking associations saying, we've got to take over the U.S., we're talking about the 1830s, they've got all the wealth, they're the total engine, they're destroying all of our monopolies, we've got to defeat them, and they tried to kill our presidents, and they
[00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:20.640]  You know, shot at them and shot them and Andrew Jackson and the rest of it.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:26.001]  Then they financed a rebellion and a revolution in the North and the South and had the Civil War.
[00:40:26.361 --> 00:40:32.042]  Finally got a strong federal government in, made the move to not let the Western states have real constitutions.
[00:40:34.602 --> 00:40:38.183]  But still, we were so free that it took them a long time.
[00:40:38.203 --> 00:40:46.765]  They didn't have the technology to fully, fully gauntlet us and fully chain us and fully dominate us.
[00:40:49.015 --> 00:40:56.517]  To muzzle, and to bridle, and to capture, and harness us.
[00:40:59.618 --> 00:41:01.519]  And so the private Federal Reserve takes over in 1913.
[00:41:01.939 --> 00:41:04.100]  They now control the issuance of money.
[00:41:05.006 --> 00:41:14.494]  For money to enter circulation, the government must go into debt, and it must go into greater debt than there is even money supply to continue to even operate.
[00:41:14.554 --> 00:41:27.104]  It's designed to generationally fully indenture us, while giving the elite the total power to issue the funds with which then they're able to buy up all the assets.
[00:41:29.057 --> 00:41:42.710]  And then in the final equation, they have to totally drive out what's left of the middle class and seize any infrastructure, not just held by the people, but held by the governments, the counties, the cities, the states, the federal level and bureaucracies.
[00:41:44.111 --> 00:41:46.413]  So they come in with unfunded federal mandates.
[00:41:47.512 --> 00:42:11.847]  to uh... fully bankrupt the states as the states raise the taxes uh... and then the police did in new york you know quadruple the number of tickets they write it's double nationwide being told they won't have jobs and they dealt with each cop totally stupid raising almost three hundred grand apiece on average you fools being told you gotta write more they can't pay your thirty thousand dollars salary
[00:42:13.469 --> 00:42:14.590]  And that's another tactic they do.
[00:42:14.831 --> 00:42:16.253]  Oh, we'll shut down the National Park.
[00:42:16.473 --> 00:42:17.194]  There's not enough money.
[00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:21.840]  And you've got to be mean and lay the park off waste to the citizens as if that will raise more money.
[00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:24.164]  But they don't implement that thinking it's their job.
[00:42:27.708 --> 00:42:29.311]  You see, with more scarcity...
[00:42:31.076 --> 00:42:39.662]  With a consolidated economy, then the elite fully controls the issuance of wealth, so they can make you do what they want.
[00:42:39.682 --> 00:42:41.904]  They can make the economy become a police state.
[00:42:42.164 --> 00:42:45.907]  They can shift us out of manufacturing into surveillance.
[00:42:45.987 --> 00:42:47.128]  I mean, that's the new America.
[00:42:47.548 --> 00:42:49.669]  That's the new, fastest-growing industries.
[00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:51.411]  That's the biggest thing in our economy.
[00:42:51.691 --> 00:42:52.572]  And it isn't stopping.
[00:42:52.612 --> 00:42:55.013]  We've just fallen off the cliff.
[00:42:55.574 --> 00:42:57.195]  There's a lot further to fall.
[00:42:58.706 --> 00:43:01.288]  We've just jumped off the precipice here and been shoved.
[00:43:02.409 --> 00:43:03.810]  And again, there's so many factors to this.
[00:43:04.431 --> 00:43:09.134]  I could go down rabbit trails all day and give you data and information.
[00:43:09.775 --> 00:43:15.799]  Again, it's like saying to someone, what was it like to see the Smoky Mountains at dawn from the mountaintop?
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:17.861]  Tell me how beautiful it was.
[00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:18.881]  Tell me.
[00:43:19.182 --> 00:43:20.703]  And I can't tell you.
[00:43:21.443 --> 00:43:22.744]  You have to see it.
[00:43:23.085 --> 00:43:24.806]  Well, just as you have to be told
[00:43:25.618 --> 00:43:51.480]  I mean, just as you can't be told the beauty of the Smoky Mountains or the beauty of the Caribbean Islands at dawn, or just as you can't be told of the beauty and what the Grand Canyon looks like at sunset, or just as you can't be told how beautiful a woman is and how the sparkle in her eyes, I cannot tell you the evil of the New World Order, my friends.
[00:43:52.919 --> 00:43:53.500]  Have to see it.
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.503]  One cannot be told about the Matrix.
[00:43:56.924 --> 00:43:58.005]  One has to see it.
[00:43:58.946 --> 00:43:59.467]  It's not true.
[00:43:59.507 --> 00:44:03.972]  I could write a 500-page book trying to detail just the surface of the control grid.
[00:44:04.212 --> 00:44:05.433]  I mean, it's at every level.
[00:44:05.774 --> 00:44:11.180]  Scientifically plumbed, prepared, just lovingly, delicately.
[00:44:12.782 --> 00:44:13.623]  It is an art form.
[00:44:16.603 --> 00:44:18.365]  No one said the elite weren't geniuses.
[00:44:18.425 --> 00:44:21.067]  No one said they weren't alive with dark fire.
[00:44:21.507 --> 00:44:29.834]  No one said their minds didn't burn and volcanically erupt with the literal white-hot slag of Hades.
[00:44:29.854 --> 00:44:36.400]  Alright, I digress.
[00:44:37.281 --> 00:44:41.264]  I said I'd go to your calls, but I mean, I'm sure, like a preacher, let me continue.
[00:44:41.324 --> 00:44:42.405]  I mean, do you want me to continue?
[00:44:45.717 --> 00:44:54.712]  So, they get us up to the 60's and they know that they can pretty much implode the economy then.
[00:44:56.525 --> 00:45:20.986]  I mean, the orders of magnitude, when you've devalued the currency already over 70% of what it was in 1913, by the mid-1960s, they could have called in all the loans, blown out the economy, gotten every house in the country, because even if they were paid for, they could come in with eminent domain, and the hordes of people that would be angry, wanting wealth, and the government would say, well, we'll take all this land and re-appropriate it to you.
[00:45:21.386 --> 00:45:24.609]  I mean, they were ready for that with the executive orders then, but they knew
[00:45:25.962 --> 00:45:29.148]  That a large portion would stand their ground and fight with firearms.
[00:45:31.024 --> 00:45:34.165]  And so they again had to have another war to further demoralize us.
[00:45:34.666 --> 00:45:37.667]  And another war for more class warfare and more race warfare.
[00:45:37.707 --> 00:45:39.608]  Another war to grow the government.
[00:45:40.108 --> 00:45:43.970]  And they needed to have a system to get the blacks under their control.
[00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:47.011]  And, oh, so we're going to give you a favor!
[00:45:47.291 --> 00:45:48.992]  You've got your own wealthy communities.
[00:45:49.032 --> 00:45:54.234]  You're becoming wealthy with your own doctors and lawyers and newspapers and cleaners and everything else.
[00:45:55.015 --> 00:45:55.675]  Clothes cleaners.
[00:45:55.695 --> 00:45:57.196]  We're going to give you an offer.
[00:45:57.236 --> 00:45:58.396]  How about a bunch of free money?
[00:45:58.416 --> 00:45:59.757]  You just can't have a man in the house.
[00:46:01.368 --> 00:46:04.509]  You go from seven, eight percent illegitimacy to over ninety percent.
[00:46:05.229 --> 00:46:06.810]  And they start working on the white community.
[00:46:06.830 --> 00:46:08.190]  They start working on all the communities.
[00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:10.071]  They start breaking down the society.
[00:46:10.391 --> 00:46:14.053]  All scientifically crafted and focused to get you dependent.
[00:46:14.373 --> 00:46:16.593]  Then they hype up the criminal justice system.
[00:46:16.734 --> 00:46:17.854]  They're going to get you on welfare.
[00:46:17.874 --> 00:46:19.194]  They're going to get you in criminal justice.
[00:46:19.214 --> 00:46:22.175]  Or they're going to tell you you've got hundreds of new psychological problems.
[00:46:22.336 --> 00:46:23.916]  They're going to get you on pharma drugs.
[00:46:23.936 --> 00:46:25.697]  And they're going to get you into the psychiatric system.
[00:46:25.717 --> 00:46:27.257]  And all of you got a mental illness.
[00:46:27.277 --> 00:46:28.358]  And they're going to divide the
[00:46:29.398 --> 00:46:50.824]  Women from the men, and tell them a woman's not successful if she doesn't dominate her man, and you don't let your man push you around, you fight with him all day, then you run the man off, and they teach the men to act like a bunch of young punks who never stand up and work for their family, who walk around like a bunch of slack-jawed gang members, and they teach you to act like fools and tell you that's what women want through the cultural imprints of the media, but that's not true.
[00:46:50.864 --> 00:46:54.965]  Then the women really don't want you, so you think, well, I better act like a bigger fool than they really want me.
[00:46:55.186 --> 00:46:56.526]  Again, it's thousands of points.
[00:47:00.149 --> 00:47:10.578]  And now, we stand here looking at this society, and they've almost got us ready.
[00:47:10.798 --> 00:47:12.800]  They've almost got us ready to be served.
[00:47:14.982 --> 00:47:21.347]  Total degenerate media and culture, violence, sex, everything unraveling, people totally self-centered,
[00:47:22.837 --> 00:47:25.119]  Unbelievable government corruptions going on.
[00:47:25.239 --> 00:47:27.781]  Over a million children taken from their parents each year.
[00:47:28.182 --> 00:47:29.803]  Crimes unspeakable.
[00:47:30.824 --> 00:47:34.908]  Seven plus million people in the criminal justice system expanding every year.
[00:47:36.669 --> 00:47:40.692]  Environmental degradation at nightmare levels everywhere.
[00:47:41.393 --> 00:47:43.355]  Genetic engineering run rampant.
[00:47:43.395 --> 00:47:45.897]  Now confirmed that's what's killing the honeybees.
[00:47:46.517 --> 00:47:47.779]  Die off globally.
[00:47:48.746 --> 00:47:50.787]  Meanwhile, they know you're going to wake up to the crisis.
[00:47:50.827 --> 00:47:56.568]  They've got a solution to global tax that has nothing to do with non-man-made global warming.
[00:47:56.869 --> 00:47:58.729]  Again, they're just slick, folks.
[00:47:59.109 --> 00:48:01.370]  They create the problem, then they've got the solution.
[00:48:06.351 --> 00:48:10.113]  So, we now stand here at the precipice.
[00:48:13.374 --> 00:48:14.794]  And they've devalued the dollar.
[00:48:19.071 --> 00:48:23.136]  Down to a cent and a half what it was worth in 1913.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.762]  A cent and a half.
[00:48:29.303 --> 00:48:38.134]  I mean, they've got things so ballooned, so pumped up, so hyped up, that, that, that, I mean, it's unspeakable.
[00:48:39.159 --> 00:48:40.159]  But here's the key.
[00:48:40.819 --> 00:48:56.924]  They know that they can fraudulently claim ownership of all the roads, and claim ownership of the government, and claim ownership of all the waterways, and claim international control, and that they can drive down the value of the dollar, and then come in with their foreign currencies, and buy everything up cheap.
[00:48:57.444 --> 00:49:04.546]  It's like 20 years ago, you could go to Mexico with 20 bucks, and spend the whole weekend, and eat five meals, and drink 15 beers, and
[00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:07.496]  Have your hotel.
[00:49:07.596 --> 00:49:10.977]  You can't now because the dollar didn't work that much and the peso's gone up.
[00:49:11.017 --> 00:49:13.738]  But it's like that, folks.
[00:49:13.918 --> 00:49:17.119]  It's a fire sale by design.
[00:49:17.719 --> 00:49:19.319]  Again, the private banks own the country.
[00:49:19.439 --> 00:49:20.960]  They devalue the dollar on purpose.
[00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:21.860]  Say it's the policy.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:26.521]  Then they can come in with all their foreign currency they hold and buy up what they didn't have.
[00:49:27.261 --> 00:49:28.982]  And most of the time, they don't even need to buy it.
[00:49:29.222 --> 00:49:32.963]  They just pay off a few politicians and they literally just say, oh, it's privatization.
[00:49:33.223 --> 00:49:34.223]  They're going to manage it.
[00:49:35.163 --> 00:49:36.464]  But here's the good news.
[00:49:38.125 --> 00:49:42.047]  It's one thing to claim you own something, and one thing to claim you hold it.
[00:49:42.267 --> 00:49:44.209]  But possession is nine-tenths of the law.
[00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:47.751]  And if we're able to expose, this is all a setup and a fraud.
[00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:55.496]  Just like if we're able to expose 9-11 as an inside job, that takes the tool of government-sponsored terror away from them.
[00:49:55.876 --> 00:49:59.318]  Well, we can break the tool of economic implosion in front of their face.
[00:49:59.938 --> 00:50:04.101]  If they know we're not, and that's why they haven't done it yet, a super-depression.
[00:50:06.664 --> 00:50:16.089]  Because if they do that, if they engage in that, they know that enough of the people, maybe 3-4%, are going to have shootouts with them.
[00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:19.550]  They know they can't come and physically get it.
[00:50:20.791 --> 00:50:24.893]  And so they're holding back as the bubble gets bigger and bigger and bigger.
[00:50:25.013 --> 00:50:29.135]  I mean, this bubble is so big, it is just, it's unbelievable to behold.
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.641]  It's impossible to articulate.
[00:50:32.021 --> 00:50:40.107]  They've got us so set up, so in their clutches, but again, it's all an illusion, as Ron Paul has said, and we realize it's a fraud.
[00:50:41.948 --> 00:50:46.471]  Now, when they do blow out the economy, which they may do, they're afraid to do it.
[00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:49.073]  See, I say I want to go to your calls, but this is so important.
[00:50:49.093 --> 00:50:49.773]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[00:50:50.433 --> 00:50:58.799]  I'm going to write some notes up during the next hour, taking your calls, got a guest on, and then in the third hour, I'm going to try to cogently just boil this down, and how to stop them.
[00:51:04.321 --> 00:51:09.765]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.165 --> 00:51:17.790]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.504 --> 00:51:25.547]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.947 --> 00:51:37.372]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.692 --> 00:51:41.634]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.654 --> 00:51:43.595]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.895 --> 00:51:47.757]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:00.914 --> 00:52:09.179]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.420 --> 00:52:13.782]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.083 --> 00:52:22.988]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.209 --> 00:52:26.831]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.111 --> 00:52:32.137]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.438 --> 00:52:39.146]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.631 --> 00:52:40.291]  What about you?
[00:52:40.952 --> 00:52:46.295]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:00.623 --> 00:53:03.225]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[00:53:03.386 --> 00:53:09.531]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[00:53:09.671 --> 00:53:18.820]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.161]  It's called Slender FX.
[00:53:20.501 --> 00:53:29.727]  SlenderFX opens the door for a healthy metabolism, permanent weight loss, reduction of low thyroid symptoms, and considerably increased energy by helping to balance your leptin levels.
[00:53:30.027 --> 00:53:32.089]  Finally, a weight loss breakthrough you can trust.

[00:54:23.037 --> 00:54:24.438]  Welcome back!
[00:54:26.299 --> 00:54:30.843]  Andrew, Peter, Joe, Brandi, Jerry.
[00:54:30.923 --> 00:54:44.634]  I'm going to get to all of you, then we're going to get our guest on.
[00:54:49.802 --> 00:54:57.466]  I do have the news here in front of me, we'll be getting to later, Osama or the Easter Bunny, who will be paying us a visit this weekend.
[00:54:58.327 --> 00:55:07.992]  CENTCOM has reliably informed us that the Easter Bunny appearance this year may be upstaged by the Goldstein himself, the back from the dead Osama Bin Laden.
[00:55:08.092 --> 00:55:12.695]  I mean this is just getting, this is just getting too disgusting.
[00:55:13.999 --> 00:55:18.921]  The Globalists are in a lot of trouble right now, so there's like 15 reports about Al-Qaeda's gonna hit us any minute.
[00:55:19.282 --> 00:55:29.346]  They wanted to blow up everything from the Eiffel Tower to Big Bend and just brace yourself and look for the nearest person wearing a black ski mask and worship them or you're all dead, basically.
[00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:32.768]  Give up all your rights to government or it's over.
[00:55:32.788 --> 00:55:36.490]  By the way, that's called terrorism, but, you know.
[00:55:38.763 --> 00:55:42.344]  People can't go read the Encyclopedia Definition of Terrorism, so let's just not worry about it.
[00:55:42.625 --> 00:55:44.405]  Give up all your rights or the bad men will get you.
[00:55:44.565 --> 00:55:45.366]  Oh, you're the terrorist.
[00:55:45.466 --> 00:55:45.966]  Oh, there you go.
[00:55:46.186 --> 00:55:47.887]  Oh, surprise, surprise, you're the ones behind it, too.
[00:55:47.907 --> 00:55:48.407]  Oh, really?
[00:55:48.427 --> 00:55:49.747]  Two plus two equals four.
[00:55:49.787 --> 00:55:50.248]  Very hard.
[00:55:51.088 --> 00:55:52.649]  Andrew in Missouri, you're on the air.
[00:55:52.709 --> 00:55:54.389]  Welcome.
[00:55:54.549 --> 00:55:57.631]  I want to talk about Ron Paul on Bill Maher.
[00:55:58.011 --> 00:55:58.711]  Sure.
[00:55:58.811 --> 00:56:02.373]  But earlier you made a comment about National Geographic.
[00:56:03.873 --> 00:56:08.435]  What they're doing is they're trying, at least what they say they're doing,
[00:56:09.159 --> 00:56:12.821]  Is they're trying to get everybody's blood so they can trace the history.
[00:56:12.841 --> 00:56:13.641]  Migration routes.
[00:56:14.121 --> 00:56:14.882]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:15.222 --> 00:56:16.582]  Total and complete bull.
[00:56:17.123 --> 00:56:17.403]  Yeah.
[00:56:18.283 --> 00:56:26.867]  But, uh, I wanted to hear what you thought about Bill Maher's mild attack on Ron Paul this weekend, this last weekend.
[00:56:27.747 --> 00:56:30.488]  I mean, what do you expect from a sniveling establishment liberal?
[00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:38.592]  They're going to say as much as they can to act like they're anti-war and anti, you know, corruption when they are the center of the problem.
[00:56:39.167 --> 00:56:39.407]  Yeah.
[00:56:41.509 --> 00:56:42.350]  Are you kidding?
[00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:47.894]  I mean, most of the Democratic leaders are on a homosexual love festival with a Republican leadership.
[00:56:48.174 --> 00:56:49.935]  It's one club, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:50.356 --> 00:56:51.577]  One club ruling us.
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:57.041]  Anything else on your mind, my friend?
[00:56:59.803 --> 00:57:01.384]  I mean, that's how it works.
[00:57:02.065 --> 00:57:03.206]  Andrew, I appreciate your call.
[00:57:03.706 --> 00:57:05.027]  Let's talk to Peter in Canada.
[00:57:05.067 --> 00:57:05.908]  Peter, you're on the air.
[00:57:05.968 --> 00:57:06.288]  Welcome.
[00:57:06.809 --> 00:57:07.169]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:07.731 --> 00:57:11.875]  Can I make a suggestion quickly before I get to my two quick questions?
[00:57:11.975 --> 00:57:23.606]  At the end of the show, maybe sign off by playing that little clip from Braveheart where Mel Gibson yells out, you know, they can take our lives, but they can't take our freedom?
[00:57:23.827 --> 00:57:27.891]  Yeah, we used to have that as a liner on the network, and it's great.
[00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:31.114]  They can take our lives, but they can't take our freedom.
[00:57:31.898 --> 00:57:36.619]  And we also had one from Mars Attacks, where they're going, they're running around shooting people, going, Don't run!
[00:57:36.659 --> 00:57:37.499]  We are your friends!
[00:57:38.859 --> 00:57:40.700]  Actually, I had those put in there.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.780]  We need to have those put back in, but that's my weird sense of humor.
[00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.461]  Some people didn't get the point.
[00:57:46.041 --> 00:57:47.241]  You know, the government does that.
[00:57:47.281 --> 00:57:50.302]  They're running around enslaving us, saying, We're your friends!
[00:57:50.322 --> 00:57:51.002]  We're your friends!
[00:57:51.402 --> 00:57:52.042]  Don't run!
[00:57:52.422 --> 00:57:55.763]  Listen, picture me as sucker, I said, Never!
[00:57:57.303 --> 00:57:57.923]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:58.929 --> 00:58:04.130]  Okay, my two quick questions and then maybe a word of inspiration to the audience there.
[00:58:05.551 --> 00:58:18.914]  Knowing what we do about the 93 World Trade Center bombing, to the best of your knowledge, do you know if any of the family members of the six people that died filed a lawsuit against the FBI?
[00:58:20.275 --> 00:58:20.895]  Say that again?
[00:58:22.259 --> 00:58:29.924]  The families of the six people who were killed in the 93 World Trade Center bombing, do you know if any of them ever filed a lawsuit?
[00:58:30.724 --> 00:58:34.647]  That is a really good question, and stay there.
[00:58:34.687 --> 00:58:37.949]  Let's talk about that when we get back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:40.970 --> 00:58:45.873]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.345 --> 00:58:57.985]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.646 --> 00:58:59.727]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.427 --> 00:59:01.528]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.189 --> 00:59:02.990]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:04.631]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.651 --> 00:59:08.935]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.516 --> 00:59:13.639]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:19.625]  I saw just an absolutely incredible 9-11 truth video.
[00:59:19.705 --> 00:59:21.967]  It's like three and a half minutes long a couple days ago.
[00:59:24.182 --> 00:59:26.684]  And since then, it's gotten pretty big on YouTube and the web.
[00:59:26.704 --> 00:59:29.566]  We've got links to it up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:59:29.706 --> 00:59:33.509]  If you go into the guest section, InfoWars.com, we've got links to the videos right now.
[00:59:33.529 --> 00:59:35.170]  A couple longer ones they've done.
[00:59:35.631 --> 00:59:43.576]  The group putting it out is Truth Action, and they're pushing for a protest in every major city, a demonstration on the 11th day
[00:59:45.423 --> 00:59:47.766]  Every month, and I want you to join them.
[00:59:47.786 --> 00:59:52.170]  I want everybody to get involved with this, because this is the type of action we need.
[00:59:52.770 --> 00:59:56.814]  Right now, though, I'm going to get through some more of these calls before we get the guest on in the next segment.
[00:59:57.174 --> 00:59:58.916]  Let's go ahead and go back to Peter in Canada.
[00:59:59.216 --> 01:00:11.487]  Peter had asked whether there were any lawsuits by the six people who died in the first World Trade Center attack, where the FBI cooked the bomb, gave them the detonators, and then told the informant to pull off the case and let the bombing go forward.
[01:00:12.419 --> 01:00:25.808]  And I believe there were some lawsuits over negligence in the government file, and there have been a bunch by 9-11 victims' families for it being an inside job or involvement or negligence, and those have all been blocked, most of them under national security.
[01:00:25.828 --> 01:00:35.975]  I mean, the families can't even sue Saudi Arabia, with the official story being they were involved, because James Baker, the former Secretary of State, and the Bush family block it under national security.
[01:00:36.515 --> 01:00:39.757]  And they better, because that's their business partners over there at Carlisle Group.
[01:00:40.278 --> 01:00:41.979]  But I hope that answers your question.
[01:00:43.256 --> 01:00:47.657]  Yeah, just one other quick question and then a word of inspiration to the audience.
[01:00:48.397 --> 01:01:01.080]  General Parton did a pretty bang-up job after the Oklahoma City bombing using his expertise in explosives to point out how ridiculous it was to suggest that a 4,000 pound fertilizer bomb could have done the damage.
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:03.161]  Yeah, former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[01:01:04.001 --> 01:01:04.701]  Yeah.
[01:01:04.741 --> 01:01:08.742]  Why do you think that he hasn't used his expertise in explosives to point out
[01:01:09.358 --> 01:01:14.219]  How the collapse of the towers clearly isn't a collapse, but rather an explosion.
[01:01:14.739 --> 01:01:16.740]  Well, General Partin just can't handle it.
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:18.621]  I've talked to him personally.
[01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:20.561]  You know what?
[01:01:20.581 --> 01:01:26.323]  I don't want to talk about private things that people told me in confidence, but it basically comes down to this.
[01:01:26.863 --> 01:01:27.583]  Listen, Alex.
[01:01:28.243 --> 01:01:31.864]  I'm a retired officer, and under the law, I can't get into these things.
[01:01:31.964 --> 01:01:34.485]  I know there's things going on, but I just can't.
[01:01:35.365 --> 01:01:36.305]  I just can't, Alex.
[01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:38.986]  Yeah, that's basically how the conversation goes.
[01:01:39.864 --> 01:01:40.724]  Hell, they're upset.
[01:01:40.744 --> 01:01:41.785]  I appreciate your call.
[01:01:45.187 --> 01:01:49.389]  I mean, Building 7, we should have explosives experts, and we have.
[01:01:50.129 --> 01:02:00.875]  I'll tell you, somebody doing a bang-up job is a website that we're going to get the head of on next week, I'm working on that, and some of the big whistleblowers.
[01:02:00.935 --> 01:02:07.138]  I mean, Marine Corps fighter pilots, Air Force fighter pilots, commercial airline pilots, colonels,
[01:02:08.112 --> 01:02:15.558]  All these military people and experts going public saying, number one, those pilots, whoever was flying those planes, couldn't do that.
[01:02:16.178 --> 01:02:18.280]  Experts couldn't do that, nine times out of ten.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:20.921]  And then all the explosive experts.
[01:02:21.082 --> 01:02:23.964]  But we do need to do what Parton did with the explosive calculations.
[01:02:25.425 --> 01:02:35.452]  But see, with Oklahoma City, they were claiming that a bomb outside did it, so he could show, with the bomb, the size they claimed it was, with basic mathematic calculations, that it couldn't.
[01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.153]  In fact, it was hundreds of times too weak.
[01:02:40.634 --> 01:02:44.076]  Plus, it didn't... it didn't knock out.
[01:02:45.357 --> 01:02:46.918]  It didn't just push over columns.
[01:02:47.078 --> 01:02:51.280]  It severed them with clean 45 degree angle blast points.
[01:02:52.441 --> 01:03:04.888]  And again, we are made to believe that, you know, Militia slash McVeigh did this, but only Imperial demolition experts are so precise, and only Imperials
[01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:08.189]  Harken the little nod I'm giving here.
[01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:12.673]  Could get in there to do it inside that federal building.
[01:03:12.693 --> 01:03:20.159]  Then we have Jane Graham, the head of HUD in the building, who saw the fed boys in their federal maintenance outfits drilling with wires.
[01:03:20.239 --> 01:03:21.240]  And she said, what's going on?
[01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:22.341]  They said, oh, we're doing some maintenance.
[01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:24.542]  And they had gray sticks of butter.
[01:03:27.525 --> 01:03:29.687]  She thought it was like weird gray putty or butter.
[01:03:29.727 --> 01:03:32.229]  And they said they were just doing some repairs, some wiring.
[01:03:32.936 --> 01:03:36.257]  Oh, I'd say they were doing some wiring all right.
[01:03:37.357 --> 01:03:42.799]  And the feds that came out picked the building because it had children in it.
[01:03:43.879 --> 01:03:51.262]  There's nothing like dead children in the arms of firefighters to get the mammals hopping mad.
[01:03:55.914 --> 01:04:01.382]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.763 --> 01:04:09.394]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.089 --> 01:04:17.151]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.551 --> 01:04:28.993]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.274 --> 01:04:32.774]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.234 --> 01:04:35.135]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.515 --> 01:04:39.356]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:52.751 --> 01:05:55.092]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:55.333 --> 01:05:57.374]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:57.514 --> 01:06:04.598]  I mean real hard to find all natural pure soap that contains no dyes, perfumes, deodorants, detergents, or other dangerous toxins.
[01:06:04.838 --> 01:06:13.463]  The Calvin Pure Soap Company for the past 57 years has been making triple concentrated pure soaps exclusively for healthcare professionals and hospitals.

[01:06:57.529 --> 01:06:58.189]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:59.910]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.610 --> 01:07:01.850]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:03.191]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.951 --> 01:07:05.452]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:09.453]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:13.795]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:30.872]  All right, we're about to talk to Cosmos.
[01:07:32.093 --> 01:07:45.185]  TruthAction.org collaborator, the person he's working with, Scott Noble, made the video that I think is the best short video, you know, under five minutes, that I've seen, the best put together, the most dynamic.
[01:07:45.866 --> 01:07:49.129]  I mean, I really don't think it could be any better.
[01:07:50.417 --> 01:07:51.477]  The way they put it together.
[01:07:51.497 --> 01:07:55.778]  So we're going to be talking to him in just a few minutes and about what they're doing.
[01:07:55.818 --> 01:07:58.439]  More importantly, not the video, but it's great.
[01:07:58.879 --> 01:08:03.580]  That's just an avenue into what they're doing with the 11th Day Project.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:09.341]  But right now, I want to go to these original callers that have been holding the longest.
[01:08:09.421 --> 01:08:11.941]  Joe, Brandi, and Jerry.
[01:08:11.961 --> 01:08:12.881]  Then we'll go right to our guests.
[01:08:12.921 --> 01:08:15.302]  Quickly, Joe in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:08:15.362 --> 01:08:15.662]  Welcome.
[01:08:16.809 --> 01:08:32.361]  Hey Alex, I'm up here in Pittsburgh and the 9-11 Truth Movement is noticeably absent from the community and I just wanted to invite your listeners in and around Pittsburgh to go to Craigslist in the community section in the groups tab.
[01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:40.908]  I have an ad up there to get people involved in trying to bring the movement to Pittsburgh and get the name out there.
[01:08:41.068 --> 01:08:45.352]  And also sir, very soon, it's the most important thing, it'll totally have a huge effect,
[01:08:45.948 --> 01:08:47.969]  I mean, we've got the traffic to really make it big.
[01:08:48.009 --> 01:08:50.370]  We're going to have a site like that for 9-11 Truth.
[01:08:50.610 --> 01:08:54.632]  We should drop everything and just work on that, but I'm doing a bunch of projects.
[01:08:54.652 --> 01:09:01.594]  The people I need to do it are doing other projects, and it may never happen, but maybe other people can get it going.
[01:09:02.015 --> 01:09:04.256]  What we need is to build a map of the country.
[01:09:04.496 --> 01:09:12.299]  When you click on the state, and then there's all the other major cities or cities near you, and then you post in that area, and then you go look for like-minded people.
[01:09:12.919 --> 01:09:13.799]  It'll explode.
[01:09:13.839 --> 01:09:15.520]  It needs to happen to get the word out.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:17.460]  And it's so important.
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:18.460]  But go ahead.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.641]  Because, see, that way we can just have a site and do it.
[01:09:20.661 --> 01:09:24.762]  We can never effectively, on air, network to the level we need because we don't have the time.
[01:09:25.542 --> 01:09:27.822]  But go ahead one more time and plug your Craigslist thing.
[01:09:29.183 --> 01:09:34.764]  Go to Craigslist Pittsburgh and go to the Community section and click on the Groups tab.
[01:09:35.084 --> 01:09:39.385]  And then, as of five minutes ago, my ad is still the first one there.
[01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.462]  Yeah, I emailed you guys an article about a week ago that came out of Germany where they're pushing that HPV.
[01:09:54.038 --> 01:10:01.744]  The good news is the governor was going to try to lie in New Mexico and claim it was the law to take the HPV.
[01:10:02.344 --> 01:10:16.975]  CFR, Bilderberg, a New World Order member, Bill Richardson, he's now backed off and saying he's not going to recommend the shot and not going to try to claim it's the law, unlike our criminal governor bought and paid for by Mexico, Rick Perry.
[01:10:18.496 --> 01:10:21.279]  So the word is out on that dangerous vaccine.
[01:10:22.199 --> 01:10:22.920]  If you Google
[01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:42.322]  Germany HPV vaccinations all these articles have come up and they're actually saying that they're the state's going to pay for for the the shots and they use Texas and Perry down there they use that as an example a false example saying that we want to model it after what Texas is doing so
[01:10:44.244 --> 01:10:45.165]  It's disgusting.
[01:10:45.365 --> 01:10:47.566]  It's disgusting, I hope, and I appreciate your call.
[01:10:48.046 --> 01:10:50.867]  I hope Germans won't roll their sleeves up and submit to that.
[01:10:51.628 --> 01:10:53.209]  Let's talk to Brandy in Tennessee.
[01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:53.609]  Go ahead.
[01:10:54.449 --> 01:10:55.150]  Bradley is the name.
[01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:57.251]  Oh, your new name is Brandy.
[01:10:57.571 --> 01:10:58.091]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:58.111 --> 01:10:59.192]  I'm an idiot.
[01:10:59.232 --> 01:10:59.572]  Go ahead.
[01:11:01.313 --> 01:11:06.355]  Someone else has come out on 9-11, and you may want to see if you can get this guy on your show.
[01:11:06.375 --> 01:11:07.756]  His name is Paul Laffley.
[01:11:09.417 --> 01:11:13.279]  He's a visionary artist held by many as a genius ahead of his time.
[01:11:14.045 --> 01:11:24.883]  He was on the design team of the World Trade Center project and has stated in a recent interview that demolition charges were included in the initial construction of the buildings.
[01:11:26.147 --> 01:11:26.587]  He talks.
[01:11:26.707 --> 01:11:27.988]  Where did you find that?
[01:11:28.148 --> 01:11:31.169]  And you know, there's another big TV star that just went public.
[01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:32.689]  I've been saying get him for a few weeks.
[01:11:32.729 --> 01:11:33.330]  We've got his number.
[01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.930]  I've got an MP3.
[01:11:34.090 --> 01:11:40.232]  I've got a URL to the MP3 of the interview and I've saved the MP3 to where he actually says it.
[01:11:40.252 --> 01:11:41.012]  Well, do me a favor.
[01:11:41.052 --> 01:11:44.934]  Send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:11:45.874 --> 01:11:47.915]  Send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:11:48.435 --> 01:11:52.316]  Send it to Kevin at InfoWars.com and we'll check him out and we'll get him on.
[01:11:52.376 --> 01:11:52.697]  Okay?
[01:11:53.297 --> 01:11:53.557]  Thank you.
[01:11:54.325 --> 01:11:55.045]  Send it right now.
[01:11:55.085 --> 01:11:55.546]  Anything else?
[01:11:56.806 --> 01:11:58.847]  Yeah, I wanted to tell you a little bit about this guy.
[01:11:59.947 --> 01:12:02.809]  He worked for the Emory... Well, let me back up a little bit.
[01:12:02.849 --> 01:12:09.091]  He talks about the main architects, Yamasaki, working with... Nomuro Yamasaki, yeah.
[01:12:09.311 --> 01:12:18.895]  Yeah, working with the project... Working on the project with some Saudi Arabian designers that were actually tied to the Bin Laden Construction Group.
[01:12:20.496 --> 01:12:22.997]  He worked for Emory Roth and Sons, Paul Lafollet.
[01:12:23.504 --> 01:12:23.844]  Yes, I am.
[01:12:23.864 --> 01:12:24.425]  I'm at my computer.
[01:12:44.283 --> 01:12:46.725]  And a lot of big stuff even on national TV gets overlooked.
[01:12:46.745 --> 01:12:58.092]  Like I've talked to like three people and I've gotten a bunch of emails that did see Jon Stewart last Monday come out and talk about government-sponsored terror and false flag and that our government's done it before and that could be happening in Iran.
[01:12:58.553 --> 01:12:59.353]  Huge news!
[01:12:59.413 --> 01:13:06.558]  Jon Stewart goes public but it's supposedly from like a week before that because he was off last week and we can't find the clip
[01:13:07.381 --> 01:13:08.702]  We should do an article on that.
[01:13:08.722 --> 01:13:15.528]  They ignore Jon Stewart because he doesn't have as much baggage as a Rosie.
[01:13:15.608 --> 01:13:22.834]  It was hiding in plain view for a while about BBC reporting Building 7 had fallen 20-something minutes before it fell.
[01:13:22.854 --> 01:13:26.798]  That actually rings a bell from months ago.
[01:13:27.498 --> 01:13:32.523]  And I think his name is there on some of the sites that chronicle all the people that have gone public.
[01:13:32.823 --> 01:13:36.467]  And again, we have such a small crew, we can't cover it all or get it all done.
[01:13:36.687 --> 01:13:38.409]  But let me just put the word out.
[01:13:38.769 --> 01:13:40.471]  That's what I want on the show.
[01:13:40.851 --> 01:13:46.657]  I want all these firefighters and police and emergency workers and whistleblowers
[01:13:47.177 --> 01:13:48.117]  I've got the audio clip.
[01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:49.498]  I'm going to send it to you right now.
[01:14:16.621 --> 01:14:17.482]  Paul Laffley.
[01:14:17.702 --> 01:14:21.666]  His last name is L-A-F-F-O-L-E-Y.
[01:14:22.107 --> 01:14:22.527]  Okay.
[01:14:23.368 --> 01:14:32.678]  And I don't have his contact information specifically, but I know somebody who would have Paul's contact info if you wanted to see about getting him on the show.
[01:14:32.738 --> 01:14:36.962]  I would do my best to... Okay, let me just give you the back office line.
[01:14:37.463 --> 01:14:39.245]  You've got the back office line, right, Network?
[01:14:40.746 --> 01:14:42.647]  Okay, just give them the back office line.
[01:14:42.987 --> 01:14:51.172]  And sir, if you're unable to get through to anybody in my office, if it goes into a black hole, then just call back to the board operator and I'll talk to you, okay?
[01:14:51.572 --> 01:14:51.712]  Okay.
[01:14:51.992 --> 01:14:52.933]  Send an email right now.
[01:14:53.233 --> 01:14:53.613]  Right now.
[01:14:54.894 --> 01:15:02.217]  Yeah, actually, I've seen this, and it actually causes pangs of rage at my own brain.
[01:15:03.038 --> 01:15:04.699]  Because, you know, that's the key!
[01:15:06.039 --> 01:15:07.540]  Is the new people coming out?
[01:15:07.601 --> 01:15:10.083]  We need to be writing articles about that at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:10.103 --> 01:15:13.546]  Paul Watson did today about all these new people that are coming out.
[01:15:13.666 --> 01:15:16.228]  He just picked a few of the most credible and the most amazing.
[01:15:16.949 --> 01:15:19.251]  I mean fighter pilot trainers folks, not just
[01:15:20.074 --> 01:15:29.999]  Not just fighter pilots, but the people that train at the most advanced schools who are, you know, veteran fighter aces who train the hot shots, the top guns.
[01:15:30.519 --> 01:15:33.281]  Going public saying, total inside job, period.
[01:15:33.761 --> 01:15:35.162]  With their credentials on the record.
[01:15:35.562 --> 01:15:48.088]  You know, that's the type of people... We're wallowing in it now, but an engineer who worked on the construction... Oh man, I just, I just, I just can't handle it anymore.
[01:15:49.896 --> 01:15:51.097]  These people are so guilty.
[01:15:51.177 --> 01:15:51.778]  We're going to get them.
[01:15:52.198 --> 01:15:52.839]  Okay, you know what?
[01:15:52.859 --> 01:15:54.260]  We're going to go to Jerry and then our guest.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.861]  Our guest is so illustrious.
[01:15:55.881 --> 01:15:56.561]  We appreciate them.
[01:15:56.822 --> 01:15:57.983]  I just promise to get to these calls.
[01:15:58.383 --> 01:15:59.224]  Jerry in Florida.
[01:15:59.264 --> 01:15:59.604]  Go ahead.
[01:15:59.624 --> 01:16:03.387]  Or Terry or whatever.
[01:16:03.667 --> 01:16:04.288]  Billy Bob.
[01:16:04.308 --> 01:16:05.148]  Somebody in Florida.
[01:16:05.168 --> 01:16:05.469]  Talk.
[01:16:05.509 --> 01:16:05.889]  Go ahead.
[01:16:05.909 --> 01:16:07.210]  Hey, Alex.
[01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.570]  Yes.
[01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:08.631]  How are you doing today?
[01:16:08.691 --> 01:16:09.452]  Jerry from Florida.
[01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:10.332]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:16:10.352 --> 01:16:13.635]  I have a question about a JSK assassination.
[01:16:15.376 --> 01:16:15.957]  Have you seen
[01:16:16.758 --> 01:16:19.640]  William Cooper's film about the driver, Kellen Kennedy?
[01:16:28.548 --> 01:16:34.295]  Uh, but, uh, and I remember the time he begged for help and the IRS was after him and I called him up and he began cussing at me.
[01:16:34.895 --> 01:16:37.999]  I had him on my radio show and he started cussing, couldn't control himself.
[01:16:38.359 --> 01:16:39.240]  I had to let him go.
[01:16:40.081 --> 01:16:43.385]  When I hung up on him, he flipped out and did hit piece after hit piece on me.
[01:16:43.745 --> 01:16:46.088]  But I was still against them murdering him at his house.
[01:16:46.148 --> 01:16:46.988]  They did set him up.
[01:16:47.989 --> 01:16:53.191]  But no, they wouldn't kill somebody right there, turning right around where the driver could be seen.
[01:16:53.732 --> 01:16:57.733]  It was people behind the grassy knoll, and folks did see that, but they got away.
[01:16:58.594 --> 01:17:07.337]  And that's what all the experts, that Jim Mars wrote with the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on it, that's what all the people I trust, and that's what all my years of research have shown.
[01:17:08.758 --> 01:17:14.240]  Now, the reason why he was killed, what's the number one reason you think why he was killed?
[01:17:16.573 --> 01:17:18.094]  Well, it was a cocktail of reasons.
[01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:19.634]  He was getting us out of Vietnam.
[01:17:19.694 --> 01:17:24.637]  He had fired the head of the CIA, and he'd fired one of the Dulles brothers out of their position.
[01:17:25.297 --> 01:17:27.918]  He was going after the main power structure.
[01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:33.100]  He signed an executive order to start shutting down the Federal Reserve and to issue U.S.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.061]  notes debt-free.
[01:17:35.722 --> 01:17:38.363]  And Kennedy just went in the absolute right direction.
[01:17:38.643 --> 01:17:39.403]  I mean, he did a 180.
[01:17:40.144 --> 01:17:42.745]  By the way, he was a big hawk and big New World Order folks.
[01:17:43.385 --> 01:17:45.286]  And just something happened, and then his brother
[01:17:46.221 --> 01:17:48.383]  I was going in the right direction, so they gunned him down.
[01:17:48.983 --> 01:17:49.323]  Really?
[01:17:50.324 --> 01:17:51.144]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:17:51.585 --> 01:17:55.867]  Thanks for being a good American and a great role model for the kids.
[01:17:56.288 --> 01:17:56.608]  You bet.
[01:17:56.628 --> 01:17:57.589]  I appreciate you, sir.
[01:17:57.669 --> 01:17:59.450]  I don't know if I'm a role model.
[01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:01.031]  And you know what?
[01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:03.352]  In the past, I wouldn't even say the things Cooper had done to me.
[01:18:04.193 --> 01:18:05.394]  Even when he attacked me, I didn't.
[01:18:06.214 --> 01:18:07.635]  When they killed him, I certainly didn't.
[01:18:08.796 --> 01:18:13.259]  It's just, you know, I've gotten to the point where I'm too tired to hold back.
[01:18:13.399 --> 01:18:14.780]  The gloves are off, folks.
[01:18:15.963 --> 01:18:17.404]  I mean, I've just gotten to the point where I don't care.
[01:18:18.164 --> 01:18:24.848]  And so, it's kind of dangerous to ask me what I think of people now, because I'll tell you, I don't have the restraint I had in the past.
[01:18:24.868 --> 01:18:26.249]  I think a lot of you picked up on that.
[01:18:30.911 --> 01:18:32.932]  But I think Bill was a good guy.
[01:18:32.952 --> 01:18:34.373]  He just got paranoid and went nuts.
[01:18:36.234 --> 01:18:37.294]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:38.235 --> 01:18:42.317]  It's just people that come up with the type of quacky stuff he did, some of the stuff he did was pretty darn quacky,
[01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:44.963]  Shouldn't throw rocks in glass houses.
[01:18:45.664 --> 01:18:46.585]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:18:46.605 --> 01:18:46.945]  Stay with us.

[01:19:44.324 --> 01:19:45.806]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:47.088]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:51.556 --> 01:19:52.537]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:52.617 --> 01:19:57.381]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:57.561 --> 01:20:05.368]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:05.628 --> 01:20:11.013]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:11.213 --> 01:20:18.199]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:18.479 --> 01:20:23.822]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:24.082 --> 01:20:28.805]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:29.145 --> 01:20:36.729]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:37.089 --> 01:20:43.333]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:43.653 --> 01:20:44.774]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:44.794 --> 01:20:45.074]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.337 --> 01:20:53.058]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:20:53.198 --> 01:20:54.539]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:20:54.699 --> 01:20:57.520]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:20:57.881 --> 01:21:00.642]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:21:01.182 --> 01:21:07.906]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:57.537]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program and million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[01:21:57.918 --> 01:21:59.680]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[01:21:59.940 --> 01:22:05.365]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:11.512]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:14.194]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.

[01:22:55.624 --> 01:23:00.508]  This is a good intro for our guest Cosmos and Scott Noble and the great work that they're doing.
[01:23:01.329 --> 01:23:02.029]  Scott is at with us.
[01:23:02.049 --> 01:23:05.232]  I want to give him the credit for making the great video that did touch my heart.
[01:23:14.717 --> 01:23:17.138]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:33.354 --> 01:23:34.976]  The globalists have reached too far.
[01:23:35.296 --> 01:23:36.057]  They overreached.
[01:23:36.197 --> 01:23:37.058]  We will expose them.
[01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.139]  We will bring them to justice.
[01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:41.422]  You have to first know that that is your destiny.
[01:23:41.442 --> 01:23:44.405]  You have to first know that you control history, not Karl Rove.
[01:23:44.905 --> 01:23:47.248]  And then you take action and everything else follows.
[01:23:47.288 --> 01:23:48.449]  And they're getting scared now.
[01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:53.033]  Many of you are just now realizing we can win against the New World Order.
[01:23:53.394 --> 01:23:54.935]  Despite what your preachers have told you.
[01:23:55.576 --> 01:23:57.678]  And how they told you to lay down and how it's the end of the world.
[01:23:58.797 --> 01:24:00.599]  Regardless, duty is ours.
[01:24:00.959 --> 01:24:03.101]  And history shows they always say it's the end of the world.
[01:24:03.381 --> 01:24:04.062]  Don't fight evil.
[01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:05.984]  That's a cop-out and a lie and a fraud.
[01:24:07.325 --> 01:24:14.472]  Well, after losing his uncle Mickey, a close family friend on 9-11, Cosmos became an activist for 9-11 Truth and Justice in early 2002.
[01:24:14.652 --> 01:24:18.175]  He's a founding member of the nation's first 9-11 Truth group.
[01:24:18.876 --> 01:24:22.899]  The Northern California Truth Alliance in 2003 started the West Coast first.
[01:24:25.043 --> 01:24:39.813]  9-11 Truth, cable access television show, the long-running The People vs. the New World Order, Cosmos hosts the 4th, Cosmos hosts the Youth for Truth, MySpace Network, and is known to readers of 9-11blogger.com as YT.
[01:24:40.314 --> 01:24:49.280]  In early 2007, he became a volunteer director of the National Days of Truth Action Campaign, taking place on the 11th day of the 11th of every month.
[01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:52.050]  I'll try to learn how to read here in a minute, folks.
[01:24:52.371 --> 01:25:04.099]  The campaign, the first ongoing national campaign for 9-11 on the 11th... You know what's happening is this print is so small and cut off, I have to try to imagine what it is on the side.
[01:25:04.119 --> 01:25:04.839]  Here, let me start over.
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:16.207]  Taking place on the 11th day of every month, the campaign, the first ongoing national campaign for 9-11 Truth, is now entering its third month of nationwide action on the 11th.
[01:25:17.421 --> 01:25:25.126]  Doubling the number of locations each month and drawing increased attention with the release of the new videos, dedicated, and the third stage.
[01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:29.489]  TruthAction.org is the website.
[01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:31.250]  TruthAction.org.
[01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:34.573]  His collaborator is Scott Noble, and he made the video for the campaign.
[01:25:34.833 --> 01:25:35.493]  This is a short segment.
[01:25:35.513 --> 01:25:37.194]  We're going to come back and air some of the audio.
[01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:39.876]  100th as powerful as the actual video.
[01:25:39.896 --> 01:25:41.837]  You can see it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:42.457 --> 01:25:44.919]  But we'll play some of that coming into the next segment.
[01:25:45.299 --> 01:25:48.200]  But Cosmos, I can only commend you for what you're doing.
[01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:49.661]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:49.741 --> 01:25:50.582]  Thanks a lot, man.
[01:25:51.142 --> 01:25:52.142]  It's an honor to join you.
[01:25:53.763 --> 01:25:59.326]  So tell me how you got involved, why you got involved, and tell us about this 11th Day campaign.
[01:25:59.366 --> 01:26:02.368]  It's a genius, and I want to support it.
[01:26:03.194 --> 01:26:04.055]  Thanks a lot, man.
[01:26:04.075 --> 01:26:11.501]  We're really glad that you picked up on this because I think it's very important that we increase 9-11 troop visibility as much as possible every day.
[01:26:12.425 --> 01:26:21.232]  I've been a long-time 9-11 Truth activist, but the original inspiration for this campaign, it came from the Boston Tea Party for 9-11 Truth going national.
[01:26:21.913 --> 01:26:39.146]  That happened back in December of 2006, and within the course of a week, two weeks, five to seven, I think, locations just spontaneously joined in with what Boston was doing with the Boston Tea Party for 9-11 Truth, and it became a national day of truth action.
[01:26:41.187 --> 01:26:48.391]  A number of us on 9-11 Blogger were talking about, we need to do this all the time, where we're all taking action for truth together at the same time.
[01:26:48.751 --> 01:26:54.914]  And, you know, the 11th day of every month, that was an obvious enough choice for when to do it.
[01:26:54.935 --> 01:27:00.558]  Yeah, I mean, we're in Austin spontaneously once a week, and it might be ten, it might be a hundred sometimes.
[01:27:00.578 --> 01:27:03.939]  Yeah, Austin 9-11 Truth Now, it's a great group in Austin.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:10.403]  And they end up going down there each week, but I think it's an even better idea to focus and make it big and do it every month,
[01:27:10.843 --> 01:27:11.744]  I don't know anyone.
[01:27:28.986 --> 01:27:30.426]  Just go out by yourself.
[01:27:30.546 --> 01:27:31.487]  That's how this starts.
[01:27:31.567 --> 01:27:32.827]  We need to increase visibility.
[01:27:32.867 --> 01:27:37.408]  And there are people who poo-poo demos with small numbers or just a few people going out.
[01:27:37.528 --> 01:27:38.869]  Folks, that's how we start.
[01:27:38.929 --> 01:27:39.629]  We gotta get out.
[01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:42.630]  I think that's the most beautiful thing.
[01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:45.910]  It always touches my heart to see one person.
[01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:52.192]  And then of course the media always tries to make the one person look nuts and show the image of the crazy guy running around, you know, saying,
[01:27:53.473 --> 01:27:58.237]  That one person is so courageous, and that one person is increasing 9-11 visibility.
[01:27:58.317 --> 01:28:06.203]  Well, the greatest thunderstorm, the greatest typhoon starts with a single droplet of water forming in the vapor.
[01:28:06.864 --> 01:28:07.324]  Exactly.
[01:28:07.384 --> 01:28:08.365]  Just take action.
[01:28:08.685 --> 01:28:20.275]  And you know, there's thousands of ways you can increase 9-11 truth visibility, from wearing a t-shirt to staging a demonstration at your local federal building, which is something we're going to be doing on April 11th, but next Wednesday in San Francisco.
[01:28:22.408 --> 01:28:23.108]  Absolutely.
[01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:24.129]  And I want to talk about 9-11.
[01:28:24.249 --> 01:28:25.950]  You know, that's getting close again.
[01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:28.411]  We're talking only five months away.
[01:28:29.011 --> 01:28:30.312]  I'm going to be in New York, folks.
[01:28:30.512 --> 01:28:31.412]  I'm going to be there again.
[01:28:31.432 --> 01:28:34.574]  And I want to redo what we did last year, but make it even bigger.
[01:28:35.274 --> 01:28:38.376]  I want to see you at Ground Zero on the morning of 9-11.
[01:28:38.436 --> 01:28:39.917]  All right.
[01:28:40.257 --> 01:28:40.957]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.977 --> 01:28:41.417]  Stay with us.
[01:28:42.218 --> 01:28:43.138]  We're on the march.
[01:28:43.618 --> 01:28:45.219]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.140 --> 01:28:48.821]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.031 --> 01:28:58.173]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:58.393 --> 01:29:00.154]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:00.414 --> 01:29:06.696]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:06.997 --> 01:29:13.119]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.359 --> 01:29:19.402]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:29:19.682 --> 01:29:26.085]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:29:26.245 --> 01:29:29.766]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:29:30.067 --> 01:29:33.788]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:29:33.968 --> 01:29:36.509]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:29:36.649 --> 01:29:37.690]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:41.271]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:05.290]  We're good to go.
[01:30:24.195 --> 01:30:24.635]  I think so.
[01:30:51.437 --> 01:30:55.720]  Everyone knows we need calcium and magnesium every day for the support of strong bones.
[01:30:55.940 --> 01:31:00.663]  But most of us are only taking one source of calcium supplementation and one source of magnesium.
[01:31:00.803 --> 01:31:09.308]  That just simply isn't enough to give your body the proper nutrition it needs to help keep bones and teeth strong, prevent osteoporosis, and support muscle function.
[01:31:09.528 --> 01:31:13.871]  Now discover the most advanced calcium and magnesium supplement on the market today.
[01:31:14.351 --> 01:31:15.191]  Select Cal 1000.
[01:31:16.272 --> 01:31:24.538]  From the folks who brought you Wachter's Sea Vegetation, Select-Cal 1000 contains 7, that's 7 sources of calcium and 4 sources of magnesium.
[01:31:24.898 --> 01:31:32.263]  Wachter's Select-Cal 1000 is also packed with other important vitamins and minerals and of course Wachter's special blend of sea vegetation.
[01:31:32.463 --> 01:31:34.784]  Try finding that in your ordinary calcium supplement.
[01:31:34.924 --> 01:31:41.789]  Order Select-Cal 1000 today and receive 10% off just by mentioning you heard on the radio in the comments portion of the order page.
[01:31:42.049 --> 01:31:44.411]  Visit wachters.com, that's W-A-C-H
[01:31:45.331 --> 01:31:46.911]  We're good to go.
[01:32:26.698 --> 01:32:26.858]  I'm good.
[01:32:32.058 --> 01:32:38.983]  These things, the good things that have been done, the reforms that have been made, the wars that have been stopped, was not done by government edict.
[01:32:39.283 --> 01:32:41.544]  It was not done by the three branches of government.
[01:32:41.564 --> 01:32:47.268]  It was not done by that structure which we pointed out in junior high school, which they say is democracy.
[01:32:47.889 --> 01:32:49.850]  It was all done by citizens' movements.
[01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:58.836]  And then keep in mind that great movements in the past have risen from small movements, from these tiny clusters of people that have gotten together here and there.
[01:32:59.216 --> 01:33:00.457]  I've always been strong enough.
[01:33:00.577 --> 01:33:02.159]  It doesn't matter who's in the White House.
[01:33:02.239 --> 01:33:04.220]  What really matters is what are people doing?
[01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:05.301]  What are people saying?
[01:33:05.341 --> 01:33:10.366]  What are people demanding?
[01:33:11.046 --> 01:33:14.769]  We're happy to see you and all your peanut guys doing the perp walk.
[01:33:15.190 --> 01:33:15.390]  Perp.
[01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:17.251]  You're in discretion with 9-11.
[01:33:17.352 --> 01:33:18.753]  We know that you're all good.
[01:33:47.139 --> 01:33:49.441]  We demand answers!
[01:33:49.501 --> 01:33:52.083]  We demand the truth about 9-11!
[01:33:55.506 --> 01:33:58.748]  Bush gave Cheney that order in May 2001.
[01:33:59.048 --> 01:34:04.693]  Cheney was orchestrating all the wargames that were being conducted on 9-11.
[01:34:07.103 --> 01:34:11.485]  You can find the video on InfoWars.com and PresentPlanet.com.
[01:34:11.505 --> 01:34:13.066]  It's the featured video on InfoWars.
[01:34:13.486 --> 01:34:17.629]  Easiest way to find it, about halfway down the page you see a picture of Bush's face.
[01:34:18.169 --> 01:34:24.072]  They've actually produced two videos, more than that, but the two newest are Dedicated and The Third Stage.
[01:34:24.092 --> 01:34:27.854]  The video you just heard is called The Third Stage and that's just part of it.
[01:34:28.755 --> 01:34:29.815]  A little more than half of it.
[01:34:30.275 --> 01:34:31.435]  You need to see it online.
[01:34:31.455 --> 01:34:33.996]  And listen, every day now, I say, get the word out.
[01:34:34.036 --> 01:34:36.636]  Go to DefendRosie.com, sign the petition.
[01:34:36.656 --> 01:34:38.077]  We've got now over 10,000 there.
[01:34:38.097 --> 01:34:40.097]  It malfunctioned and said 20-something thousand.
[01:34:40.117 --> 01:34:40.457]  I was wrong.
[01:34:40.477 --> 01:34:40.877]  It's over 10,000.
[01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:42.597]  That's great in like a day and a half.
[01:34:43.718 --> 01:34:44.938]  We're going to send those to ABC.
[01:34:44.978 --> 01:34:45.498]  Great job.
[01:34:45.558 --> 01:34:45.958]  Keep it up.
[01:34:46.178 --> 01:34:48.218]  And then today, I say, go get this video.
[01:34:48.238 --> 01:34:49.258]  Get it out to everybody.
[01:34:49.719 --> 01:34:50.939]  It's a battering ram, folks.
[01:34:50.979 --> 01:34:51.919]  They're in their fortress.
[01:34:51.959 --> 01:34:53.659]  We're literally ramming the door.
[01:34:53.739 --> 01:34:57.660]  And each day, we're just going to keep ramming the door.
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:01.382]  And more people join, our battering ram gets stronger every day.
[01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:02.923]  Understand something.
[01:35:03.063 --> 01:35:06.645]  I guarantee you, I was able to predict the 9-11 attacks because of the data I had.
[01:35:07.205 --> 01:35:08.306]  I can look at the big picture.
[01:35:08.846 --> 01:35:18.452]  And again, I can understand it, I can see it as clear as day, but it's hard to even articulate all the data that goes into it to be able to explain something.
[01:35:18.472 --> 01:35:21.614]  But I'm telling you, they would have already released some type of bioweapon,
[01:35:22.813 --> 01:35:27.037]  They did the anthrax, and I predicted on 9-11 they'd probably launch some type of bio-attack to keep the fear going.
[01:35:27.077 --> 01:35:27.798]  They did do that.
[01:35:28.439 --> 01:35:35.926]  But the point is, even bigger, they would have probably done a dirty bomb, maybe even a nuke, to radically re-engineer society.
[01:35:35.986 --> 01:35:38.369]  But they know now that that's losing its power.
[01:35:40.015 --> 01:35:44.863]  On every front, they're getting caught with the British SAS staging terror in Basra.
[01:35:44.883 --> 01:35:47.207]  They're getting caught with the Israelis getting staging doing it.
[01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:53.917]  All these ministers and ambassadors are going public about the British doing it.
[01:35:53.997 --> 01:35:55.059]  Our government's being caught.
[01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:56.930]  The Russians are being caught.
[01:35:56.990 --> 01:36:01.793]  I mean, we're breaking, as Webster Tarpley said, we are taking their favorite tool and we're going, you like this tool?
[01:36:01.953 --> 01:36:04.575]  And we're just taking it and just smashing it upside their head.
[01:36:04.775 --> 01:36:06.416]  Here, here, you like this so much?
[01:36:06.476 --> 01:36:07.877]  Here, here, why don't you keep it?
[01:36:08.297 --> 01:36:09.538]  Bashing it over their head.
[01:36:09.598 --> 01:36:10.358]  I'm serious!
[01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:12.980]  And we're going to do the same thing
[01:36:14.315 --> 01:36:16.837]  With what they're trying to do to the economy and so many fronts.
[01:36:16.897 --> 01:36:19.179]  But I'm telling you, 9-11 is the key.
[01:36:19.339 --> 01:36:20.480]  It is the key.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.681]  Just like those articles Paul Watson wrote last year.
[01:36:23.242 --> 01:36:24.563]  And I love how they use that at the end.
[01:36:24.663 --> 01:36:25.424]  It is the key.
[01:36:25.484 --> 01:36:26.364]  It's the foundation.
[01:36:26.765 --> 01:36:27.605]  It's what they're doing.
[01:36:27.645 --> 01:36:28.566]  It's what they're using.
[01:36:29.307 --> 01:36:31.228]  And we're talking to the folks from Truth Action.
[01:36:31.288 --> 01:36:31.728]  I like that.
[01:36:31.788 --> 01:36:34.470]  TruthAction.org, Cosmos.
[01:36:35.471 --> 01:36:41.236]  I want to talk about your plan for the next year and building up to 9-11, but expanding out into the year after that.
[01:36:42.216 --> 01:36:43.738]  Right now, Cosmos, but first,
[01:36:44.676 --> 01:36:51.158]  Tell us about Scott Noble, this filmmaker, because he's got a great eye and just amazing skill.
[01:36:51.178 --> 01:36:55.059]  He must have put a lot of work into finding those clips to integrate them together like that.
[01:36:55.099 --> 01:36:57.500]  I think he got lightning in a bottle with that one.
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:01.281]  Yeah, well, Scott did such a brilliant job on the video.
[01:37:01.761 --> 01:37:04.242]  It's, I think, a real gift to the movement.
[01:37:06.247 --> 01:37:17.437]  You know, I wish she was on here with us today, but I also wanted to clarify that Dedicated, the video Dedicated, was actually produced and put together by Luke in New York City, who I know is a friend of yours.
[01:37:18.177 --> 01:37:26.644]  That's right, it's got his friend, and there's also, there's so many on the side I get confused, but there's the fellow who lost his daddy, he was a firefighter who just died mysteriously.
[01:37:27.065 --> 01:37:33.470]  Yeah, Luke's friend, Dan Wallace, and he actually died right before we launched this monthly campaign on
[01:37:35.152 --> 01:37:47.524]  On February 11th, he died a few weeks before that and Dedicated is dedicated to Dan Wallace and Dan Wallace, I feel that he's a guardian angel.
[01:37:48.303 --> 01:37:51.224]  for this campaign and 9-11 truth in general.
[01:37:51.264 --> 01:37:52.425]  He lost his father.
[01:37:52.445 --> 01:37:56.946]  His father was a firefighter and he lost him on 9-11 in the towers.
[01:37:57.106 --> 01:38:03.649]  Of course, according to O'Reilly, all the family members love the official story, love Giuliani, love Bush, and we're evil.
[01:38:03.929 --> 01:38:09.291]  The truth is, ladies and gentlemen, I couldn't keep the firefighters off of me at ground zero to even get my work done.
[01:38:09.671 --> 01:38:12.793]  Yeah, well, Dan Wallace would have told you that that story was a pile of trash.
[01:38:12.833 --> 01:38:16.234]  He said he believed the official story for, you know, all of about a minute.
[01:38:16.935 --> 01:38:26.340]  Um, and he was, you know, he had a lot, he didn't believe the story and he was just coming out and just starting to speak up for 9-11 Truth, um, right before he died.
[01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:31.923]  And, uh, we are determined, we vow to get justice for Dan Wallace and his father.
[01:38:32.043 --> 01:38:33.323]  What really happened with Dan?
[01:38:33.343 --> 01:38:34.624]  I mean, what's the official story?
[01:38:36.089 --> 01:38:39.979]  Um, basically his family has requested privacy in the matter.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:44.692]  Um, they've indicated that they don't feel that there was any foul play involved.
[01:38:47.395 --> 01:38:51.417]  Was he real depressed about his dad dying?
[01:38:51.898 --> 01:38:52.218]  No.
[01:38:52.778 --> 01:38:53.338]  No, he wasn't.
[01:38:53.619 --> 01:38:56.840]  I think I even met him at Ground Zero.
[01:38:57.521 --> 01:38:59.062]  He was a hard charger.
[01:38:59.102 --> 01:38:59.702]  He was happy.
[01:38:59.722 --> 01:39:00.703]  He was fighting the enemy.
[01:39:01.243 --> 01:39:04.105]  Oh yeah, he was getting out all the time and taking action.
[01:39:04.125 --> 01:39:10.888]  You can see all that in the video dedicated, which is up at truthaction.org or you can go to wearechange.org.
[01:39:10.948 --> 01:39:11.829]  That's the website.
[01:39:11.929 --> 01:39:15.472]  Some of the Coattell Pro operators attacked him after he died, in particular.
[01:39:15.512 --> 01:39:16.232]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:16.372 --> 01:39:23.998]  And I want to say, I want to say that Luke, you know Luke, he is just, he's such an amazing activist in New York City, what he's doing.
[01:39:24.038 --> 01:39:29.381]  And I've got to say, you know, they're picking on him, you know, because he's a young, rising star.
[01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:35.546]  He's organizing the youth in New York City, and you know, we've got to support New York City activism.
[01:39:35.566 --> 01:39:37.007]  You know, this is where this all went down.
[01:39:37.347 --> 01:39:39.629]  Luke is getting out there, he's been out at Ground Zero.
[01:39:40.169 --> 01:39:45.652]  Well, I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
[01:39:45.892 --> 01:39:52.736]  The larger 9-11 truth group there is blocking him from even coming into events now.
[01:39:52.756 --> 01:39:54.037]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:39:54.717 --> 01:40:01.281]  This is the person who's actually doing street activism in New York, and they have bodyguards outside the church trying to keep him out of there.
[01:40:01.541 --> 01:40:04.983]  They've cut him off from funds so they don't have flyers or DVDs.
[01:40:05.703 --> 01:40:06.323]  We're good to go.
[01:40:19.326 --> 01:40:25.610]  What I think behind all that, I think, is a very deliberate campaign of disruption.
[01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:33.994]  And I feel that New York City is a target because, just by default, they're the flagship group in the country because that's where 9-11 happened.
[01:40:36.371 --> 01:40:42.794]  You know, I think there's really no need to get into it, but we really have to be there as a movement.
[01:40:42.834 --> 01:40:48.076]  We have to back up the people who are taking action, the people who are getting out there and doing stuff.
[01:40:48.136 --> 01:40:48.957]  And Luke has been.
[01:40:49.037 --> 01:40:53.099]  I just want, you know, all the truth movement to support him and what he's doing.
[01:40:53.299 --> 01:40:54.819]  Because he is under attack.
[01:40:54.839 --> 01:40:58.081]  People are putting out open letters, you know, attacking him.
[01:40:59.230 --> 01:41:05.678]  Yeah, but I mean, when a flagship sinks, you just launch another one.
[01:41:05.738 --> 01:41:10.104]  Now, let me just stop right there and shift gears, okay?
[01:41:11.106 --> 01:41:13.930]  Let's get into your plan.
[01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:16.233]  The plan you guys have come up with I think is excellent.
[01:41:16.673 --> 01:41:16.934]  I think so.
[01:41:30.621 --> 01:41:35.125]  Right now on this show, or create your own template, but I think this 11th day idea is great.
[01:41:35.485 --> 01:41:38.728]  Build momentum towards September 11th in New York.
[01:41:38.868 --> 01:41:39.529]  I'm going to be there.
[01:41:39.549 --> 01:41:45.234]  I'm asking everybody to be there again, and to do the same thing we did last year with 2,000 people.
[01:41:45.274 --> 01:41:46.975]  I bet it's going to be 10,000 this year.
[01:41:47.476 --> 01:41:48.496]  No way to ignore it.
[01:41:48.616 --> 01:41:50.138]  Got lots of attention last year.
[01:41:51.175 --> 01:42:00.611]  And just building, building, building through the next election, because what's going to happen is, once they put the Democratic shills in, the Democrats have already raised double what Republicans have, reversing
[01:42:01.915 --> 01:42:03.856]  A 15 year plus trend.
[01:42:04.296 --> 01:42:06.157]  We know that it's going to be the Democrats now.
[01:42:06.197 --> 01:42:09.198]  They're going to change horses like the Pony Express.
[01:42:09.518 --> 01:42:11.439]  The Democrats will have some limited hangout.
[01:42:11.799 --> 01:42:12.499]  Whitewash.
[01:42:12.859 --> 01:42:14.700]  They'll tell everybody go to sleep.
[01:42:15.180 --> 01:42:19.141]  And suddenly all the liberals and people that were in 9-11 Truth will go to sleep.
[01:42:19.201 --> 01:42:25.344]  We have to pre-wake people up now and let them understand that I'm predicting the Democrats within 12 years
[01:42:26.144 --> 01:42:30.266]  Within 12 months in office, we'll invite out the elite behind them.
[01:42:30.326 --> 01:42:38.589]  A super massive attack to continue the terror paradigm if we do not intensify and continue right through the election.
[01:42:38.829 --> 01:42:47.132]  Now, 9-11 truth may get so big, they may pull Bush or impeach him on the corruption, on the Gonzales stuff, on the lying.
[01:42:47.552 --> 01:42:49.873]  I mean, Time Magazine's calling for him to step down.
[01:42:50.153 --> 01:42:53.614]  The elite are trying to shelve Bush and put all the dirt
[01:42:54.114 --> 01:43:00.981]  on him as a sacrificial hog when he's certainly a demon and hateable, but again he's just that, a puppet demon.
[01:43:01.361 --> 01:43:06.967]  We need to focus on the New World Order, the military-industrial complex that carried this out.
[01:43:07.207 --> 01:43:07.908]  Lay out your plan.
[01:43:08.613 --> 01:43:15.420]  Yeah, exactly, and that's one of the beautiful things about an ongoing campaign that takes place every month, and we're not going to stop until justice.
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:16.321]  It builds momentum!
[01:43:16.341 --> 01:43:19.644]  We're not going to stop when the Democrats come in and do their little cover-up thing.
[01:43:19.885 --> 01:43:21.346]  We're going to be out there on the 11th.
[01:43:21.386 --> 01:43:24.169]  We're going to keep getting out on the 11th until justice.
[01:43:25.752 --> 01:43:33.335]  So, also, this is setting up a framework, because right now, I mean, we're just on the verge of a truth explosion in the USA, and this is setting up a framework.
[01:43:33.715 --> 01:43:38.317]  So, I mean, soon there's going to be people everywhere who want to get out, they want to get involved, they want to take action.
[01:43:38.357 --> 01:43:39.098]  They're there now.
[01:43:39.238 --> 01:43:41.319]  They just don't know who to communicate with.
[01:43:41.659 --> 01:43:43.500]  They just don't know who to interface with.
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:45.961]  Stop looking for orders from headquarters.
[01:43:46.321 --> 01:43:48.342]  You are the leader.
[01:43:48.402 --> 01:43:49.162]  There's no leaders.
[01:43:49.342 --> 01:43:50.783]  You have to be the leader, people.
[01:43:51.483 --> 01:43:52.823]  This is an economist campaign.
[01:43:52.843 --> 01:43:55.884]  I want to tell all your listeners right now, just get involved right now.
[01:43:55.904 --> 01:43:58.865]  You can go to truthaction.org slash forum.
[01:43:59.325 --> 01:44:00.225]  Go into the forum.
[01:44:00.265 --> 01:44:03.586]  There are forums set up for each month, for the 11th of each month.
[01:44:03.866 --> 01:44:07.227]  Just go in there and sign up and be a contact for your area.
[01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:12.988]  And by the way, people who look at this can find you and, you know, you can be the person that's out there that they can get in touch with.
[01:44:13.288 --> 01:44:14.768]  And by the way, let me add something here.
[01:44:14.788 --> 01:44:15.809]  This is really important.
[01:44:16.349 --> 01:44:18.029]  It's not just about 9-11 Truth.
[01:44:18.069 --> 01:44:27.672]  We are creating a real, grassroots, populist, non-partisan movement that is aware of government tyranny, the Patriot Act, the North American Union.
[01:44:27.692 --> 01:44:29.572]  9-11 Truthers all share this.
[01:44:29.592 --> 01:44:32.253]  I haven't found one who doesn't know about the New World Order now.
[01:44:32.573 --> 01:44:39.655]  This is really an anti-globalist movement, an anti-New World Order movement, a fusion, a sword against the New World Order.
[01:44:40.335 --> 01:44:45.678]  A war machine against their fraud and against their lie for the truth.
[01:44:45.818 --> 01:44:48.139]  This is a defensive shield.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:54.723]  This is a siege engine against their operations and it's growing and forming organically.
[01:44:55.123 --> 01:44:58.465]  This is going to be, you watch, 9-11 Truth is the key.
[01:44:58.925 --> 01:45:01.867]  It is going to be the make it or break it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:45:01.927 --> 01:45:05.809]  We are forging the organic intelligence network, the organic
[01:45:06.570 --> 01:45:09.212]  Bellwether, the organic early warning system.
[01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:20.345]  This is the system that is going to lead the rebellion that is going to result in the downfall of the New World Order's capital ship that is the seized United States.
[01:45:20.645 --> 01:45:22.947]  We can get the United States back.
[01:45:23.148 --> 01:45:25.150]  We can definitely get states back.
[01:45:25.550 --> 01:45:26.691]  States want to secede.
[01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:28.472]  People want to reconvene the Union.
[01:45:28.752 --> 01:45:30.654]  You've got to first believe the dream.
[01:45:30.854 --> 01:45:38.759]  You've got to know it can happen, and then aggressively prosecute this war, this information war against the New World Order.
[01:45:38.799 --> 01:45:41.041]  But you've got to release yourselves.
[01:45:41.061 --> 01:45:43.142]  You've got... You have to stand up.
[01:45:43.363 --> 01:45:44.643]  You have to look in the mirror.
[01:45:44.824 --> 01:45:47.285]  You have to have the courage, and you've got it in you.
[01:45:47.345 --> 01:45:48.746]  You just didn't know you had it.
[01:45:49.026 --> 01:45:53.790]  And you've got to get confident, and turn loose of your fear, and take action!
[01:45:55.059 --> 01:45:55.580]  Exactly.
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:56.021]  Wow.
[01:45:56.221 --> 01:45:57.064]  I couldn't have said it better.
[01:45:58.046 --> 01:45:58.708]  Take action.
[01:45:58.728 --> 01:45:59.670]  Get out in the streets.
[01:46:02.256 --> 01:46:07.979]  Man, get on the message boards and call in to talk radio shows and make copies of films and give people video links of films.
[01:46:08.379 --> 01:46:15.322]  The thing is, a lot of people who are now find themselves in the 9-11 truth movement, they don't have any experience necessarily with activism beforehand.
[01:46:15.802 --> 01:46:18.664]  It's really not that hard, folks, and there's so many things you can do.
[01:46:18.744 --> 01:46:25.147]  I mean, you can put a sign, alright, just today I think I saw something up on 9-11 Blogger, there's someone who's launching a campaign, yard signs.
[01:46:25.738 --> 01:46:27.718]  Yard signs on the 11th day of every month.
[01:46:27.738 --> 01:46:36.880]  You put a sign in your yard on the night of the 10th, and so you have a 9-11 truth sign in your yard the whole day of the 11th, and you don't take it down till the morning of the 12th.
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:38.321]  Now that's something... And you know what?
[01:46:38.361 --> 01:46:40.581]  So what if it makes your neighbors look at you?
[01:46:40.621 --> 01:46:44.222]  Those cowards, your neighbors that are cowards, are already living in fear.
[01:46:44.302 --> 01:46:45.602]  You've got to save your family.
[01:46:45.882 --> 01:46:47.462]  You've got to stick your face out there.
[01:46:47.502 --> 01:46:48.623]  You've got to be shown.
[01:46:48.903 --> 01:46:50.363]  You've got to be in the front lines.
[01:46:51.061 --> 01:46:51.701]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:46:51.821 --> 01:46:52.882]  We are America.
[01:46:52.982 --> 01:46:54.502]  I mean, the polls show us that.
[01:46:54.642 --> 01:46:55.723]  We are America.
[01:46:55.843 --> 01:46:57.624]  And that's what this campaign is about.
[01:46:57.704 --> 01:47:00.104]  It's about popularizing activism.
[01:47:00.205 --> 01:47:11.529]  It's about... And if you want to find like-minded people, you've got to wear the t-shirt, wear the cap, you've got to walk around... Folks, if you wear a 9-11 Truth shirt, and you
[01:47:12.529 --> 01:47:18.835]  Walk down the street, or you hold up a 9-11 sign, you're going to have a lot of people come up to you.
[01:47:19.276 --> 01:47:19.656]  Okay?
[01:47:19.696 --> 01:47:20.937]  I mean, that's just the way it works.
[01:47:20.957 --> 01:47:22.579]  You want to meet people, that's how you do it.
[01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.750]  Exactly.
[01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:27.213]  People, you'll be surprised when you just go out and start talking to people.
[01:47:27.253 --> 01:47:27.873]  That's the thing.
[01:47:27.893 --> 01:47:29.215]  It's like, we are America.
[01:47:29.275 --> 01:47:30.135]  We're the majority.
[01:47:30.676 --> 01:47:35.320]  And most people share our views more than not about what's going on.
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:37.242]  But the information is hidden.
[01:47:37.322 --> 01:47:39.123]  We just have to make it available to people.
[01:47:39.204 --> 01:47:44.809]  So keep duplicating those DVDs, flyers, handing them out, and you'll meet the best people.
[01:47:44.909 --> 01:47:48.532]  And you'll have the best talks that you've had in your community in a long time.
[01:47:48.652 --> 01:47:50.193]  Cosmos, let me ask you a question.
[01:47:50.293 --> 01:47:53.775]  Are you not seeing fear in the eyes of the Bill O'Reilly's and the Dory Becks?
[01:47:53.795 --> 01:47:54.275]  Oh, are you kidding?
[01:47:54.495 --> 01:48:00.239]  They're basically announcing... I mean, if I put a translator on Bill O'Reilly, he's saying, it's curtains for us.
[01:48:00.359 --> 01:48:00.999]  We're over.
[01:48:01.099 --> 01:48:01.659]  We're doomed.
[01:48:01.799 --> 01:48:04.541]  Please, please back off the 9-11 truth.
[01:48:06.162 --> 01:48:07.183]  It's amazing.
[01:48:07.223 --> 01:48:07.983]  They're hilarious.
[01:48:08.043 --> 01:48:09.704]  They're great, these Fox News clips.
[01:48:09.924 --> 01:48:11.825]  Oh yeah, they're panic saying they're taking over.
[01:48:12.246 --> 01:48:13.927]  Every call we get on the show says this.
[01:48:13.967 --> 01:48:17.990]  That's what Mike Gallagher was saying.
[01:48:18.010 --> 01:48:19.190]  And they're saying, you better stop it.
[01:48:19.411 --> 01:48:20.231]  You'll be arrested.
[01:48:20.251 --> 01:48:20.992]  You'll be killed.
[01:48:21.052 --> 01:48:21.632]  You're traitors.
[01:48:21.652 --> 01:48:22.613]  We're going to kill you.
[01:48:22.873 --> 01:48:25.715]  They're trying to spark at us and scare us.
[01:48:25.755 --> 01:48:29.657]  It's like a bully who's been picking on you and you finally punch him back and break their nose.
[01:48:29.898 --> 01:48:31.639]  And he says, I'm going to really beat you up now.
[01:48:31.919 --> 01:48:32.820]  Don't listen to that bully.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:34.501]  Go ahead and karate chop him right in the neck.
[01:48:35.183 --> 01:48:35.744]  Exactly.
[01:48:36.364 --> 01:48:40.188]  And you know, you can pay for better PR than what they're giving us on Fox News now.
[01:48:40.228 --> 01:48:46.135]  I mean, jeez, anytime you turn it on they're saying 9-11 was an inside job, orchestrated by elements within our own government, you know.
[01:48:46.455 --> 01:48:50.279]  I'm sure people are going to be cutting up these clips and doing a little guerrilla propaganda.
[01:48:50.339 --> 01:48:52.080]  And by the way, the government's not stupid.
[01:48:52.100 --> 01:48:53.761]  They tried to ignore us for three years.
[01:48:54.202 --> 01:48:55.382]  Then they tried to demonize.
[01:48:55.422 --> 01:48:56.543]  That only blew up in their face.
[01:48:56.563 --> 01:48:57.524]  Then they tried to debunk.
[01:48:57.564 --> 01:48:58.384]  That blew up in their face.
[01:48:58.724 --> 01:49:00.866]  Now they're doing all out total assault.
[01:49:00.886 --> 01:49:01.906]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:49:02.147 --> 01:49:03.207]  We're going to kill you.
[01:49:03.528 --> 01:49:04.268]  You're traitors.
[01:49:04.668 --> 01:49:09.331]  They're trying to inoculate the public now and tie it to Rosie O'Donnell and make it a liberal issue.
[01:49:09.571 --> 01:49:10.572]  It ain't going to work.
[01:49:10.832 --> 01:49:13.014]  Let me tell the propaganda something up there.
[01:49:13.094 --> 01:49:19.678]  I know your top people told you government and Fox News not to go with what you did, but the boys upstairs should go ahead and attack them.
[01:49:20.038 --> 01:49:20.478]  Yeah, yeah, agreed.
[01:49:32.828 --> 01:49:36.493]  I think that was a foolish move to go ahead with these style attacks.
[01:49:36.954 --> 01:49:38.957]  It shows a real desperation on their part.
[01:49:39.097 --> 01:49:40.579]  And frankly, it's over for them.
[01:49:40.639 --> 01:49:41.681]  We just have to keep it up.
[01:49:42.121 --> 01:49:42.902]  They're hemorrhaging!
[01:49:43.042 --> 01:49:44.585]  Kicking it up a notch every day.
[01:49:44.705 --> 01:49:45.726]  They're hemorrhaging!
[01:49:46.187 --> 01:49:48.069]  And folks, Death by a Thousand Cuts.
[01:49:48.270 --> 01:49:49.151]  Just keep stabbing.
[01:49:49.171 --> 01:49:49.672]  Just get in there.
[01:49:55.072 --> 01:50:00.538]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:00.899 --> 01:50:08.507]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.235 --> 01:50:16.296]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.676 --> 01:50:28.098]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.418 --> 01:50:32.259]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.379 --> 01:50:34.319]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.639 --> 01:50:38.500]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:51.641 --> 01:50:56.922]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:50:57.142 --> 01:50:59.203]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:50:59.443 --> 01:51:06.564]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:51:06.704 --> 01:51:18.207]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[01:51:18.607 --> 01:51:26.012]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[01:51:26.272 --> 01:51:31.256]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[01:51:31.396 --> 01:51:36.399]  Disconnect your application, and the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[01:51:36.699 --> 01:51:42.763]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:42.783 --> 01:51:46.846]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:47.126 --> 01:51:48.387]  That's toll-free, triple
[01:51:51.788 --> 01:51:55.849]  People who use cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:51:56.049 --> 01:51:59.450]  For over five years, cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:51:59.630 --> 01:52:03.151]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on cardivite.
[01:52:03.371 --> 01:52:06.691]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:52:06.771 --> 01:52:12.113]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:52:12.153 --> 01:52:17.294]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:52:17.714 --> 01:52:18.455]  We're good to go.
[01:52:29.188 --> 01:52:33.612]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:52:33.632 --> 01:52:35.074]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:52:35.234 --> 01:52:39.118]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:52:39.138 --> 01:52:39.978]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:53:04.800 --> 01:53:29.165]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
[01:53:31.425 --> 01:53:53.101]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[01:53:53.541 --> 01:53:55.542]  Life's sweetest friend
[01:53:58.266 --> 01:54:08.150]  Everyone I know goes away in the end.
[01:54:08.490 --> 01:54:11.291]  And you could have it all.
[01:54:28.354 --> 01:54:29.595]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:30.256 --> 01:54:36.021]  I want to ask Cosmos to stay with us a little bit in the next hour to talk about more activism and take your calls.
[01:54:36.041 --> 01:54:39.184]  We're going to get to Chris and Dave and Mike and Mike and Tim and others.
[01:54:39.464 --> 01:54:45.569]  Before we go back to Cosmos and tell you about what they're doing and how you can get involved, I need to put a plug in sometime in the three hours.
[01:54:46.470 --> 01:54:49.393]  I've made Terror Storm a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:54:50.319 --> 01:54:51.900]  It's very effective at waking people up.
[01:54:52.340 --> 01:54:54.101]  It proves that government staged terror attacks.
[01:54:54.141 --> 01:54:57.803]  It proves they carried out 9-11 and 7-7 over in London.
[01:54:58.363 --> 01:55:02.745]  And it gets into their propaganda, their brainwashing, the war, how they want to attack Iran.
[01:55:03.145 --> 01:55:04.466]  It really is an important film.
[01:55:04.526 --> 01:55:06.527]  Terror Storm, available at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:07.407 --> 01:55:10.008]  We also have America, Freedom to Fascism by Aaron Russo.
[01:55:10.348 --> 01:55:13.849]  A great new film, Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:16.310]  Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 2.
[01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:17.111]  This is now out.
[01:55:17.531 --> 01:55:18.571]  An amazing film.
[01:55:18.971 --> 01:55:33.857]  We're also carrying films like 9-11 Press Retreat, The Jersey Girls, Mind Control, A Brave New World, Iraq for Sale, The War Profiteers, 9-11 Aftermath, and a lot of other great films on the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:35.254 --> 01:55:36.355]  Or again, call toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:55:36.375 --> 01:55:36.415]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:36.435 --> 01:55:39.977]  You can also write to me on Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:55:52.228 --> 01:56:12.220]  Also, there is the website, PrisonPlanet.tv, now three years up and running, three years continually, thousands of pieces of media, all 15 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, dozens and dozens of other films have been authorized to post, thousands of my best audio interviews by title and date.
[01:56:13.241 --> 01:56:18.084]  Folks, it's an amazing... I mean, if there's a particular topic you want to give somebody on CD,
[01:56:18.866 --> 01:56:20.567]  Or a particular film of mine you want.
[01:56:20.727 --> 01:56:21.628]  It's in high quality.
[01:56:21.648 --> 01:56:26.831]  You can burn these down to disc or CD and give them to people and it looks almost as good as a regular DVD.
[01:56:27.312 --> 01:56:29.953]  I mean, it's an amazing factory of resistance.
[01:56:30.554 --> 01:56:40.320]  PrisonPlanet.tv and by paying 15 cents a day or $5.95 a month, you allow us to pay for the servers and the webmasters and to make the video, shoot the video, edit the video, upload the video.
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:47.545]  You know, so I can get in my car and drive over to the TV studio and do the live show here locally and then put it up on the web and I can get my TV show.
[01:56:48.408 --> 01:56:52.251]  Three years of my TV show up there archived on the web at PrismPlanet.tv.
[01:56:52.671 --> 01:56:55.854]  We're about to start taking my Sunday show with a two-camera shoot.
[01:56:56.314 --> 01:56:58.636]  We've got like 20-something episodes of that now.
[01:56:58.976 --> 01:57:01.658]  We're going to start putting that up, start uploading the newer ones of that up.
[01:57:01.678 --> 01:57:06.622]  It just takes money to have somebody that can work to do that, to shoot it, to edit it, to put it up.
[01:57:07.723 --> 01:57:11.566]  But that'll be added to PrismPlanet.tv, some of the select shows.
[01:57:12.296 --> 01:57:13.777]  It's just going to get better and better, folks.
[01:57:14.037 --> 01:57:17.420]  But we need your financial support at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:21.283]  I can't imagine where you're going to support somebody where it's going to have a bigger effect.
[01:57:21.824 --> 01:57:24.145]  I mean, we are lean, mean fighting machines.
[01:57:24.526 --> 01:57:26.307]  We are in the battle, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:26.828 --> 01:57:28.869]  Ounce for ounce, we pack the biggest punch.
[01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.830]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:32.152 --> 01:57:36.395]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:42.278 --> 01:57:44.360]  Big Brother.
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:45.381]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:45.401 --> 01:57:47.002]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:47.062 --> 01:57:47.983]  You want answers?
[01:57:54.657 --> 01:57:55.538]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.558 --> 01:58:00.221]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.401 --> 01:58:04.504]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.404 --> 01:58:11.108]  Now, already into hour number three, I will get into the financial setup, the implosion they've rigged.
[01:58:11.749 --> 01:58:13.330]  But they don't have the will to activate it.
[01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:19.394]  You see, they can activate it if their top statisticians and sociologists and group psychologists
[01:58:20.257 --> 01:58:22.079]  Believe that you won't go along with it.
[01:58:22.159 --> 01:58:23.480]  So we can't go along with it.
[01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:24.040]  You understand?
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:26.202]  If you go along with it, then they will do it.
[01:58:26.242 --> 01:58:29.084]  It's really quite simple once you think about it, but have you ever thought about it?
[01:58:29.464 --> 01:58:31.266]  That's coming up, plus the big news blitz.
[01:58:31.546 --> 01:58:32.947]  Right now, we're going to your phone calls.
[01:58:32.967 --> 01:58:38.271]  We're talking to Cosmos, San Francisco, 9-11, Truth Activist, who has started TruthAction.org.
[01:58:40.203 --> 01:58:47.472]  Amazing video that his colleague, his collaborator, Scott Noble put together, a third stage, and we've got that up on the website.
[01:58:47.552 --> 01:58:48.914]  Please, aggressively spread it.
[01:58:48.954 --> 01:58:50.796]  It's very effective and just power-packed.
[01:58:51.177 --> 01:58:52.118]  Now, let's go to calls.
[01:58:52.238 --> 01:58:56.303]  Chris in Florida, and then we'll go to Dave, Mike, Mike, Tim, and others.
[01:58:56.323 --> 01:58:56.884]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:58:56.904 --> 01:58:57.365]  You're on the air.
[01:58:58.619 --> 01:59:06.025]  Alex, there's a website, there's a blog that was announced a few days ago and it sounds like it's a nasty blog.
[01:59:06.125 --> 01:59:08.587]  It's geared towards being anti-Rosie.
[01:59:09.088 --> 01:59:15.634]  I've helped turn that around and I didn't make it, but I'll just let you know if people want to join me.
[01:59:16.174 --> 01:59:17.956]  It's called rosieisadumbass.com.
[01:59:18.940 --> 01:59:26.602]  And I have more readers watching my thread than, you know, on 9-11, Rosie Conspiracy Series, than any of the other threads.
[01:59:27.622 --> 01:59:33.084]  And I just wanted to... And so by calling it what you wrote in the Neocons?
[01:59:35.504 --> 01:59:41.046]  Well, actually, the moderator made a message order, made a thread just for me.
[01:59:41.781 --> 01:59:47.145]  And since then, even though all the other threads had a head start, I've had a lot more viewers than any of the other ones.
[01:59:47.405 --> 01:59:49.166]  Oh, so it is an anti-Rosie site?
[01:59:49.747 --> 01:59:50.267]  Yes, it is.
[01:59:50.527 --> 01:59:51.308]  Yes, it is.
[01:59:51.708 --> 01:59:54.770]  Have you seen the new comic site that's up on Prison Planet?
[01:59:54.790 --> 02:00:00.374]  We have a link to it where they act like they're against Rosie and free speech and want to ban freedom in America.
[02:00:00.735 --> 02:00:01.875]  It's really hilarious, folks.
[02:00:01.895 --> 02:00:02.596]  You should go check it out.
[02:00:03.405 --> 02:00:03.765]  Not yet.
[02:00:04.506 --> 02:00:13.672]  And also I want to encourage people, like you say, to call into talk shows, techniques that I've used just to be calm, but give radical sounding accusations or claims.
[02:00:13.892 --> 02:00:17.514]  You know, call the talk show host a coward for not letting you speak.
[02:00:18.054 --> 02:00:20.296]  And usually the talk show host will shut up.
[02:00:21.136 --> 02:00:23.698]  Tell them that they're a sellout, that they've sold out their own listeners.
[02:00:24.398 --> 02:00:27.640]  Tell the audience that you can't trust a coward because they'll always sell you out.
[02:00:28.261 --> 02:00:31.743]  And outright accuse the talk show host
[02:00:32.333 --> 02:00:53.776]  of being cowardly liars and uh... and sellouts and neocons if you like uh... either you know tell them that uh... you know that they'll have a discussion with someone who's uh... supposedly anti-war or supposedly uh... a conspiracy theorist but they'll only talk to those who don't who aren't armed with the facts so you know that means that they're usually plant callers
[02:00:55.056 --> 02:01:01.520]  So when you sound calm and relaxed calling in a talk show, they wonder what kind of dirt do they have on you.
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:06.944]  So that really makes the listener perk up their ears and usually, like I say, the talk show host will shut up when you... No, you're right.
[02:01:06.984 --> 02:01:08.025]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:08.225 --> 02:01:11.147]  Let me comment on this and then get a comment from Cosmos on it.
[02:01:12.448 --> 02:01:19.693]  I've worked in talk radio for 12 years and I've been in probably 100 plus studios, live on shows.
[02:01:19.913 --> 02:01:22.615]  I've been on well over 4,000 interviews.
[02:01:22.655 --> 02:01:23.816]  I quit counting like a year ago.
[02:01:25.518 --> 02:01:27.579]  I mean, some days I've done like 15 interviews a day.
[02:01:27.639 --> 02:01:29.079]  Now I do like one or two a week.
[02:01:29.119 --> 02:01:30.339]  I just turn most of them down.
[02:01:30.359 --> 02:01:32.740]  I'm just too busy, so they quit calling.
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:34.820]  I really should do it, but I just can't do it all.
[02:01:36.121 --> 02:01:38.761]  But if you call in and go, yeah, I want to make a point, and they say, what is it?
[02:01:38.801 --> 02:01:40.522]  Because they screen your call, and you're very cogent.
[02:01:40.782 --> 02:01:44.282]  They say, sorry, we've got enough of that view, and they put idiots on.
[02:01:44.522 --> 02:01:45.543]  So you have to be deceptive.
[02:01:45.563 --> 02:01:50.764]  You have to call it and go, either that you agree with the host, or we're going to probably have so much of that.
[02:01:51.364 --> 02:01:57.307]  I just act dumb and go, he's a dummy and I like Rosie.
[02:01:57.367 --> 02:02:03.150]  And then boy, they will freak out once you get on and say, why are you calling for the destruction of free speech?
[02:02:03.611 --> 02:02:05.772]  Why did they destroy the crime scene?
[02:02:06.272 --> 02:02:07.973]  Did you know about CIA insider trading?
[02:02:08.013 --> 02:02:08.934]  PresidentPlanet.com.
[02:02:09.374 --> 02:02:10.094]  Why are you afraid?
[02:02:10.134 --> 02:02:11.935]  Why did your call screener kind of block me out?
[02:02:14.697 --> 02:02:16.238]  What tactics do you use, Cosmos?
[02:02:19.847 --> 02:02:24.051]  Well, I just want to say, since you guys mentioned Rosie, I just gotta say she's a true American hero.
[02:02:24.131 --> 02:02:27.374]  God bless Rosie O'Donnell for what she has done for America.
[02:02:27.394 --> 02:02:29.336]  I agree.
[02:02:29.356 --> 02:02:29.676]  Stay there.
[02:02:29.756 --> 02:02:31.498]  Let's comment more on Rosie when we get back.
[02:02:32.719 --> 02:02:35.322]  And we'll go to Dave, Mike, Mike, Tim, and others.
[02:02:35.842 --> 02:02:37.304]  Final segment with our guest.
[02:02:37.924 --> 02:02:40.647]  And the website is very important to visit.
[02:02:40.667 --> 02:02:41.968]  We'll tell you about it when we get back from break.
[02:02:46.923 --> 02:02:52.367]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:52.747 --> 02:03:00.333]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.081 --> 02:03:08.146]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.526 --> 02:03:19.973]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.273 --> 02:03:23.916]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.236 --> 02:03:26.157]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.497 --> 02:03:30.340]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:43.484 --> 02:03:48.586]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:48.646 --> 02:03:55.948]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:56.108 --> 02:04:06.391]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:06.932 --> 02:04:11.473]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:11.753 --> 02:04:16.756]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:04:16.956 --> 02:04:19.898]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.118 --> 02:04:29.804]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:04:43.211 --> 02:04:47.994]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[02:04:48.234 --> 02:04:58.041]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good- As you may have heard by now, Ken Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[02:05:44.294 --> 02:05:50.320]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:50.921 --> 02:05:53.904]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:59.361 --> 02:06:01.903]  Mark Wahlberg's got a new movie coming out.
[02:06:04.345 --> 02:06:09.069]  Where elements of the government try to set him up for shooting a president.
[02:06:10.450 --> 02:06:11.932]  Just like Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:06:13.693 --> 02:06:17.036]  And there's a scene in the film, we've got a story up on PrisonPlanet.com about it.
[02:06:18.314 --> 02:06:24.579]  There's a scene in the new movie coming out called The Shooter where he's sitting there talking about the media and lies.
[02:06:24.619 --> 02:06:26.201]  He goes, let's look at what else the lies are.
[02:06:26.221 --> 02:06:30.384]  And he's reading a newspaper and right in front of him is the 9-11 commission report.
[02:06:30.865 --> 02:06:33.567]  Just all these little messages in the film.
[02:06:35.709 --> 02:06:38.451]  We're talking the cosmos of truthaction.org.
[02:06:38.491 --> 02:06:38.972]  We're taking
[02:06:39.722 --> 02:06:40.683]  Your phone calls.
[02:06:41.944 --> 02:06:48.568]  Yeah, let me get your take on Rosie going public and the type of critical mass it's taken on and what you think is going to happen in the future.
[02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:51.350]  Well, it's just amazing.
[02:06:51.370 --> 02:06:56.494]  I mean, what's going on is Rosie has opened the door for us and we just have to kick it wide open.
[02:06:56.534 --> 02:06:58.435]  We just have to kick it off the hinges.
[02:06:58.755 --> 02:07:04.579]  Rosie has put herself out there like this, done us such a huge favor and we just have to go for it.
[02:07:04.599 --> 02:07:06.541]  We have to go for the throw every day.
[02:07:06.601 --> 02:07:08.182]  Just kick that door in.
[02:07:13.478 --> 02:07:17.560]  What do you see in this going with Rosie?
[02:07:17.640 --> 02:07:19.601]  I see Rosie standing her ground.
[02:07:19.901 --> 02:07:27.084]  She doesn't strike me as someone who's easy to push around or someone who backs down from speaking their mind.
[02:07:27.104 --> 02:07:33.587]  And I thought that thing she released last week, Rosie Pledges Allegiance to the Truth, that was just beautiful.
[02:07:33.607 --> 02:07:35.468]  I mean, what an amazing
[02:07:36.368 --> 02:07:37.549]  Patriotic statement.
[02:07:37.789 --> 02:07:48.155]  And she went on to say, with all the bad things happening in this country, and the attack on speech, and people calling for my death, this shows me we're in worse trouble than I thought, and that this really is real.
[02:07:48.675 --> 02:07:49.556]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:07:49.616 --> 02:07:54.419]  I mean, hey, there's Danny Bonaduce just proving her point.
[02:07:55.059 --> 02:07:59.242]  For speaking her mind in America, she's getting people calling for her death.
[02:07:59.822 --> 02:08:01.383]  And that's just ridiculous.
[02:08:01.443 --> 02:08:02.163]  It's so trashy.
[02:08:02.463 --> 02:08:05.225]  Well, you're going to see something out of Rosie next week.
[02:08:05.625 --> 02:08:07.226]  I have a lot of internal information.
[02:08:07.246 --> 02:08:11.008]  I'm going to stop right there and leave it at that.
[02:08:11.288 --> 02:08:19.472]  There's a really important part of the campaign, or an important element that I didn't get to mention yet that I'd really like to mention, and that's when you guys go out and do your actions on the 11th.
[02:08:19.612 --> 02:08:21.153]  Make sure you get documentation.
[02:08:21.193 --> 02:08:21.853]  Get pictures.
[02:08:22.233 --> 02:08:38.004]  Get video and send it in to truthaction.org because that's a really important part of this campaign is showing America what is really going on in America and we want, you know, we want pictures of your actions and we want to put them up at truthaction.org and promote truth activism.
[02:08:38.124 --> 02:08:40.026]  So, you know, send in those pictures.
[02:08:40.346 --> 02:08:44.549]  If you're just one person, you know, out standing by the side of the highway with a sign, you know,
[02:08:45.149 --> 02:08:52.333]  Get your friend to take your picture, you know, and send it in to us, and your courageous act will inspire others to action.
[02:08:52.573 --> 02:08:53.113]  Absolutely.
[02:08:53.153 --> 02:08:57.095]  I mean, you don't have to shoot video of it and upload it on YouTube yourself, even though that's easy.
[02:08:57.736 --> 02:08:59.757]  You can send it to InfoWars.com.
[02:08:59.777 --> 02:09:01.337]  You can send it to 9-11 Blogger.
[02:09:01.738 --> 02:09:03.318]  You can send it to TruthAction.org.
[02:09:03.398 --> 02:09:04.399]  Send it to everybody.
[02:09:05.522 --> 02:09:06.762]  Get it out there in the community.
[02:09:07.162 --> 02:09:20.905]  But take a video camera, or take a disposable camera, or take a digital camera, and scan those pictures in, email them out to everybody, because that really is the whole point, is then the feedback loop of putting your activism into the World Wide Web.
[02:09:21.705 --> 02:09:22.265]  Exactly.
[02:09:22.445 --> 02:09:24.966]  And your actions inspire action.
[02:09:25.186 --> 02:09:32.507]  I'll tell you one of the best forms of demonstration and protest and guerrilla communication is what you show in that little three and a half minute piece
[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:33.540]  Yeah.
[02:09:33.621 --> 02:09:35.522]  The third stage that you guys just put out.
[02:09:35.542 --> 02:09:37.464]  There's beautiful parts in that.
[02:09:38.045 --> 02:09:44.011]  Is that it shows different shots of billboards and signs and stuff over overpass.
[02:09:44.031 --> 02:09:45.132]  9-11's an inside job.
[02:09:45.853 --> 02:09:47.494]  Investigate WTC 7.
[02:09:47.735 --> 02:09:48.956]  9-11's a new Reichstag.
[02:09:49.356 --> 02:09:50.457]  That stuff is all over.
[02:09:50.517 --> 02:09:52.740]  I see bumper stickers all over Austin on the walls.
[02:09:53.851 --> 02:10:00.397]  Yeah, and also if it is just you, or just you and three friends, and if you do have a picture, and it's a really good picture, well then just, you know, that just
[02:10:17.867 --> 02:10:29.430]  It makes the power of your action, you know, it amplifies it exponentially, because when you put it up on the web, then thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people see your action.
[02:10:29.550 --> 02:10:31.290]  Absolutely, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[02:10:31.670 --> 02:10:34.551]  Let's talk to Dave in Wisconsin.
[02:10:34.571 --> 02:10:35.511]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:10:35.531 --> 02:10:37.132]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:10:37.992 --> 02:10:45.694]  Where I work, I have a 19-year-old National Guard kid come up to me and he's like, I'm ready to go kill in Iraq, and I'm like,
[02:10:46.414 --> 02:10:50.435]  Well, you know, just saying killing and stuff is a lot different than actually doing it.
[02:10:51.215 --> 02:10:54.315]  And he's like, I've watched so many movies and video games.
[02:10:54.475 --> 02:10:55.576]  I'm ready for killing.
[02:10:55.796 --> 02:11:00.357]  And I'm like, well, what about the shell shock people that come back in a post traumatic stress?
[02:11:01.057 --> 02:11:02.417]  Well, they should have been ready.
[02:11:03.077 --> 02:11:09.878]  He says to me, and I'm like, well, I hope he's ready because people with an attitude like that get killed in the first five minutes.
[02:11:10.678 --> 02:11:10.918]  Yeah.
[02:11:11.078 --> 02:11:12.859]  And then I, Alex, I have a question for you.
[02:11:12.879 --> 02:11:13.759]  I have three sons.
[02:11:14.660 --> 02:11:15.961]  One's a 19-year-old son.
[02:11:16.001 --> 02:11:17.082]  He's very intelligent.
[02:11:17.222 --> 02:11:23.508]  He makes videos and PowerPoint presentations and stuff about truth, because they all know the truth.
[02:11:24.249 --> 02:11:32.016]  But he has the pessimistic view that, you know, you guys will all be hung and stuff and that the New World Order will win.
[02:11:32.839 --> 02:11:35.360]  Well, I'll just say this, and he'll hear that all day in church, too.
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:36.261]  Let me just say this.
[02:11:37.782 --> 02:11:39.663]  I don't care if they hang me, okay?
[02:11:39.723 --> 02:11:42.364]  Number one, when you have that attitude, you can't be beaten.
[02:11:42.845 --> 02:11:46.747]  They can physically beat my body, but they cannot beat my soul that belongs to Jesus.
[02:11:47.407 --> 02:11:48.568]  A, that's number one.
[02:11:48.928 --> 02:11:53.490]  Number two, I know history shows that we can beat these people, and we don't have a choice.
[02:11:53.671 --> 02:11:58.813]  And this system is so predatory, it's going to feed on everyone if we do let it win.
[02:11:59.154 --> 02:12:00.955]  It feeds on people that serve it.
[02:12:00.975 --> 02:12:01.635]  Let me tell you something.
[02:12:02.373 --> 02:12:11.502]  New World Order people, and I've been around Bush, I've been around Hillary, I've been around Rick Perry, I've been around the Queen of the Netherlands and Richard Holbrook and David Rockefeller.
[02:12:11.963 --> 02:12:14.085]  They are scared to death of us.
[02:12:14.505 --> 02:12:23.855]  We look to them, people who aren't afraid to die, people who aren't into the flesh as much as they are, people who aren't totally given over to wickedness and weakness,
[02:12:24.155 --> 02:12:26.956]  You know, they do all of what they do really out of fear more than anything.
[02:12:27.256 --> 02:12:31.097]  We're like thousand-foot iron giants to them, okay?
[02:12:31.177 --> 02:12:35.558]  And I'm alive one time, and I want to tune in to what the human spirit's really all about.
[02:12:35.938 --> 02:12:37.118]  I want to give.
[02:12:37.278 --> 02:12:38.198]  I want to build.
[02:12:38.318 --> 02:12:39.799]  I want to be a real warrior.
[02:12:40.419 --> 02:12:42.679]  You know, this is a facsimile of fraud.
[02:12:42.919 --> 02:12:51.822]  The warrior spirit to be lied to and go off and kill some women and children and fight people in their homeland for no reason is not a warrior spirit.
[02:12:52.182 --> 02:12:53.242]  A warrior spirit
[02:12:54.275 --> 02:13:13.713]  He is truly being in the right, and your soul, your subconscious will know, not this fraud, not this counterfeit, and standing and defending your family, and that means your community, the expansion of your family, and that's where, you know, it isn't that we, people get confused, you know, there's the killer instinct, and I don't totally agree with
[02:13:14.173 --> 02:13:14.734]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:35.667]  I mean, it is overpowering.
[02:13:35.727 --> 02:13:41.129]  It is an instinctive drive, you know, more powerful than lovemaking, okay?
[02:13:41.749 --> 02:13:44.330]  And that is the joy of battle, and I wouldn't call it joy.
[02:13:44.751 --> 02:13:48.392]  It is a giving oneself over to killing, okay?
[02:13:48.432 --> 02:13:53.434]  And that is only meant when you are being overrun, when you're caved, your teepees
[02:13:55.735 --> 02:13:58.776]  Are being overrun by the enemy and you're defending your children.
[02:13:59.176 --> 02:14:02.978]  And that's when you take that tomahawk and that's when you kill a hundred men.
[02:14:03.318 --> 02:14:03.678]  Okay?
[02:14:04.318 --> 02:14:10.441]  And so this manliness, you know, you are the bad guys when you go over to Iraq and that's why they're going to lose.
[02:14:10.761 --> 02:14:11.861]  They will lose.
[02:14:12.141 --> 02:14:12.702]  Period.
[02:14:12.922 --> 02:14:13.882]  It was foretold.
[02:14:14.042 --> 02:14:15.143]  There's no way they'll win.
[02:14:15.383 --> 02:14:16.083]  They're going to lose.
[02:14:16.383 --> 02:14:20.405]  And the troops need to go ahead and realize when you're on the side of wrong, you're going to lose.
[02:14:21.125 --> 02:14:23.166]  I mean, it's just like that Johnny Cash song.
[02:14:23.606 --> 02:14:23.906]  Okay?
[02:14:24.966 --> 02:14:26.047]  Collin, does that answer your question?
[02:14:26.067 --> 02:14:26.227]  Yeah.
[02:14:26.507 --> 02:14:28.148]  Well, I have one more thing to say.
[02:14:28.228 --> 02:14:33.009]  I have a feeling something really, really big is just around the corner, like, really going to happen.
[02:14:33.049 --> 02:14:37.971]  Like, I don't know if it's the election or what, but I just keep getting this feeling in my dreams and everything else.
[02:14:38.512 --> 02:14:46.735]  And that one thing, one idea, tell me how to put together a chronological order of the 9-11 breakthroughs that are happening and people coming out.
[02:14:46.775 --> 02:14:52.317]  Because if you could just, if somebody could just see all the people and the things happening, you know, all in one
[02:14:54.934 --> 02:15:01.276]  There are sites doing that, and I've always wanted to do that on Prison Planet and InfoWars, but we're so busy writing up-to-date articles.
[02:15:01.597 --> 02:15:06.398]  But there are sites that show all the new defense people, and intelligence people, and military that are going public.
[02:15:06.659 --> 02:15:07.419]  Hundreds of names.
[02:15:07.759 --> 02:15:10.500]  There are sites with the physicists and engineers going public.
[02:15:10.780 --> 02:15:11.601]  Hundreds of names.
[02:15:12.001 --> 02:15:14.002]  There are sites with the victims going public.
[02:15:14.042 --> 02:15:14.962]  Thousands of names.
[02:15:15.342 --> 02:15:17.923]  We need to index and integrate that all in together.
[02:15:17.943 --> 02:15:22.246]  I know there's some IT wizard or somebody at a company who's got employees who could do it.
[02:15:22.606 --> 02:15:23.286]  They need to do it.
[02:15:23.326 --> 02:15:24.087]  We'll have them on here.
[02:15:24.107 --> 02:15:24.647]  We'll promote them.
[02:15:24.687 --> 02:15:25.647]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:26.108 --> 02:15:30.490]  You know, I mean, do you want to speak to that, Cosmos, to the attitude of there's no way to win?
[02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:33.171]  Well, of course there's no way to win if you've got that attitude.
[02:15:33.432 --> 02:15:35.092]  Well, yeah, and you know what, Alex?
[02:15:35.212 --> 02:15:38.014]  People need to unplug their televisions.
[02:15:38.394 --> 02:15:39.836]  I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:15:39.876 --> 02:15:41.898]  You know, I've got mine out in the hall.
[02:15:41.938 --> 02:15:42.639]  It's unplugged.
[02:15:42.679 --> 02:15:47.244]  I would just go ahead and throw it away, except I'm saving it for the 9-11 trials, okay?
[02:15:47.464 --> 02:15:50.947]  Which are coming up real soon, because America is headed for truth revolution.
[02:15:51.228 --> 02:15:52.149]  That's where we're going.
[02:15:52.409 --> 02:15:53.770]  And I don't want to hear any negativity.
[02:15:53.851 --> 02:15:57.514]  I'm working 24 hours a day on truth activism.
[02:15:57.594 --> 02:15:59.096]  I don't have time for negativity.
[02:15:59.156 --> 02:15:59.717]  You know, that's...
[02:16:00.237 --> 02:16:03.378]  That's, you know, have you heard of the colonization of the mind?
[02:16:03.758 --> 02:16:17.200]  That's what they're doing with that TV, and that's what they're doing with the radio, and plastering their messages on every surface, you know, their corporate messages of, you know, we control you, resistance is futile.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:20.181]  Resistance is fertile, and we're taking over.
[02:16:21.841 --> 02:16:27.422]  So unplug your TVs, take action for 9-11 truth, you know, stop buying the lie.
[02:16:28.672 --> 02:16:29.793]  Amen brother, keep going.
[02:16:31.614 --> 02:16:33.736]  Yeah, well I mean it's really, I mean it's a really big thing.
[02:16:33.776 --> 02:16:49.589]  I mean people, you know, parents sit their kids down in front of the TVs when they're little kids, you grow up, you know, you just, you're fed this stuff and you're plugged into it and you know, it's like the Matrix, but really, you know, it's as easy as unplugging it, you know, and just saying no, and you steer your own course.
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:17:06.074]  You know, we've got to take over, and really, you know, the TV, the mass media, it's just, you know, it's created this blanket, you know, that just blankets people's minds with, you know, it happens at a subconscious level, you know, they don't even realize it's happening, but it's, you know, it really is this brainwashing effect.
[02:17:06.474 --> 02:17:07.075]  And I want to say this.
[02:17:07.095 --> 02:17:09.657]  The number one thing we've got to do is unplug from that.
[02:17:10.157 --> 02:17:11.598]  Bottom line, I agree with you.
[02:17:11.618 --> 02:17:21.746]  People get all excited that Rosie's on TV and this stuff is coming out and you hear 9-11 was an inside job a million times a day on Fox News and so you want to keep watching, keep plugging in.
[02:17:22.086 --> 02:17:27.230]  But look folks, just watch the clips online because they're never going to come around.
[02:17:27.510 --> 02:17:31.253]  We have to dismantle the corporate media in this country, bottom line.
[02:17:31.793 --> 02:17:35.095]  And we do that by not watching them and discrediting them as government operatives.
[02:17:35.395 --> 02:17:36.576]  It's not a bias, folks.
[02:17:37.017 --> 02:17:40.038]  Most of those shows are actual federal operated.
[02:17:40.379 --> 02:17:41.099]  You understand that?
[02:17:41.339 --> 02:17:41.940]  That's real.
[02:17:43.405 --> 02:17:46.407]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:46.728 --> 02:17:51.651]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:51.912 --> 02:17:56.255]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:56.555 --> 02:18:05.482]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:05.682 --> 02:18:09.305]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:09.585 --> 02:18:14.632]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:14.913 --> 02:18:21.603]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:22.122 --> 02:18:22.782]  What about you?
[02:18:23.423 --> 02:18:28.786]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:18:44.495 --> 02:18:48.157]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:48.577 --> 02:18:54.000]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:54.460 --> 02:18:55.541]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[02:18:55.581 --> 02:18:59.623]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:00.263 --> 02:19:13.591]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metals holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:13.611 --> 02:19:19.395]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:19.695 --> 02:19:25.579]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:19:26.339 --> 02:19:28.121]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.182 --> 02:19:32.346]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:19:32.786 --> 02:19:33.387]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:33.427 --> 02:19:35.589]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:19:35.609 --> 02:19:35.669]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.815 --> 02:19:48.379]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:51.723]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:19:52.043 --> 02:19:54.605]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:59.790]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:20:00.171 --> 02:20:05.556]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:20:05.856 --> 02:20:08.819]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:20:08.999 --> 02:20:10.540]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[02:20:11.660 --> 02:20:16.363]  Many people believe that this will be the mark of the beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[02:20:16.563 --> 02:20:20.705]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[02:20:21.005 --> 02:20:27.288]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the mark of the beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[02:20:27.628 --> 02:20:29.249]  It says, worship the beast.
[02:20:29.529 --> 02:20:32.130]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[02:20:32.390 --> 02:20:37.599]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:20:37.619 --> 02:20:37.959]  That's 1-888-211-1715.

[02:21:17.665 --> 02:21:20.585]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[02:21:20.865 --> 02:21:28.227]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[02:21:28.627 --> 02:21:31.988]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[02:21:32.368 --> 02:21:33.888]  Secure your position today.
[02:21:34.188 --> 02:21:35.428]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.

[02:21:43.884 --> 02:22:00.399]  Look, here's the bottom line.
[02:22:01.040 --> 02:22:06.585]  When you lay around cowardly and you don't get involved, corruption grows and you get dominated and run over.
[02:22:06.906 --> 02:22:08.307]  And the things you're afraid of happen.
[02:22:09.022 --> 02:22:12.844]  If you're willing to get up and go toe-to-toe with somebody, chances are they're not going to mess with you.
[02:22:12.864 --> 02:22:13.624]  They're going to move on.
[02:22:15.125 --> 02:22:17.225]  It isn't even a decision, okay?
[02:22:17.485 --> 02:22:19.466]  Our government is run by a bunch of demons.
[02:22:19.926 --> 02:22:21.187]  They're completely out of control.
[02:22:21.227 --> 02:22:22.487]  They're staging terror attacks.
[02:22:22.768 --> 02:22:23.568]  We're not going to stop.
[02:22:24.088 --> 02:22:25.088]  Cosmos is our guest.
[02:22:25.109 --> 02:22:25.789]  He's about to lose us.
[02:22:25.949 --> 02:22:32.852]  I've got to get into some other news, cover some other issues, but real fast here, let's talk to Mike in Ohio, then Mike in Florida, then Tim, John, and others.
[02:22:32.892 --> 02:22:33.452]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:22:33.992 --> 02:22:34.292]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:34.352 --> 02:22:35.233]  I'm a first-time caller.
[02:22:35.253 --> 02:22:36.853]  I've been listening to your show for about a year or so.
[02:22:36.873 --> 02:22:38.654]  Let me just say I really admire the work you're doing.
[02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.991]  Getting the truth out there.
[02:22:40.031 --> 02:22:41.972]  Anybody can really talk and your actions stand out.
[02:22:41.992 --> 02:22:42.953]  I want to thank you for that.
[02:22:44.114 --> 02:22:48.397]  First, I've got a question, but first I wanted to give you some information about this StopRosie propaganda.
[02:22:48.437 --> 02:22:54.622]  I went and signed DefendRosie.com, and I went to sign StopRosie.com, which is Don't Bully Rosie.
[02:22:54.862 --> 02:22:56.283]  They told me improper language.
[02:22:56.503 --> 02:22:58.985]  They're so scared of Rosie that she's now considered profanity.
[02:22:59.345 --> 02:23:03.388]  And what I found out was I went to sign a second time, and it let me do it.
[02:23:03.548 --> 02:23:05.790]  That whole petition is a complete fraud.
[02:23:06.485 --> 02:23:08.967]  First of all, you can sign it as many times as you want.
[02:23:09.067 --> 02:23:15.793]  The petition going after Rosie, when I looked at it, like 70-80% was anti-New World Order.
[02:23:16.434 --> 02:23:22.739]  I mean, it's all like, go Rosie, go Rosie, down O'Reilly, 9-11, inside job, inside job.
[02:23:23.180 --> 02:23:29.465]  Yeah, but the legitimate signatures on it could possibly be some neocon groups out there sitting there by a computer working eight hours a day just signing.
[02:23:29.485 --> 02:23:31.227]  Well, I mean, how many signatures does it have?
[02:23:31.767 --> 02:23:34.288]  Um, right now it had about over 25,000.
[02:23:34.729 --> 02:23:42.393]  I looked over about 10,000 at DefendRosie.com and I realized that, you know, if you can sign that many times, of course there's going to be that much more.
[02:23:42.433 --> 02:23:43.173]  You've got polls like
[02:23:44.057 --> 02:23:54.665]  Well, what I'm telling you is, they're not going to be able to actually send that off to ABC, because unlike ours, where it's real people and serious statements, with theirs, it's all our people.
[02:23:55.285 --> 02:23:56.506]  It's like a comic book, yeah.
[02:23:56.706 --> 02:24:00.449]  They're saying, you know, Ronald McDonald, and it goes on and on.
[02:24:00.489 --> 02:24:01.169]  It's not real.
[02:24:01.510 --> 02:24:02.570]  Yeah, no, I read through it.
[02:24:02.610 --> 02:24:06.373]  It's actually kind of funny, if anybody wants to take a look at it, but I wouldn't bother to plug that.
[02:24:06.792 --> 02:24:19.541]  My question is, to you, when we finally do win, do you believe, looking back on it in about 5 or 10 years, that Rosie's Dance on 9-11 is going to be the event that triggers the mass awakening of the general public when we look back on it?
[02:24:20.301 --> 02:24:28.027]  Well, I've talked about chain reactions and build-up, and obviously, if you want to know, and I can't go over the whole timeline, but this is how it starts.
[02:24:28.843 --> 02:24:31.124]  My previous films exposed government-sponsored terror.
[02:24:31.144 --> 02:24:32.064]  That's what I've been into.
[02:24:32.485 --> 02:24:37.847]  I exposed 9-11 two months before it happened, so people took me serious when it happened, at least on my own show.
[02:24:37.867 --> 02:24:39.448]  9-11, that morning, I go public.
[02:24:39.888 --> 02:24:44.970]  On the Power Hour and then on Derry Brownfield, to massive criticism by other radio stations and talk show hosts.
[02:24:45.570 --> 02:24:50.032]  I go public, day one, and say, we've got to get the truth out about this, this is the key.
[02:24:50.092 --> 02:24:51.773]  I'm not tooting my horn, I'm just giving you the facts.
[02:24:52.493 --> 02:25:08.260]  And then it leads to the build-up and all the things that happen, the 9-11 whitewash commission, and then Charlie Sheen, and then the C-SPAN coverage, and then the march on 9-11 set up by the Loose Change guys, and then on into Rosie, and just each step, it exponentially grows.
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:11.621]  I mean, how would you chart things out there?
[02:25:11.641 --> 02:25:19.284]  And of course, in the middle of all this, starting about a year ago, the supernova explosion of Loose Change Second Edition, and now Terror Storm, and Martial Law, and the rest of it.
[02:25:19.304 --> 02:25:20.645]  Let me get Cosmos' comment.
[02:25:21.406 --> 02:25:24.770]  Alex, you asked me an important question before and this kind of ties into it.
[02:25:24.810 --> 02:25:34.783]  I didn't get a chance to respond and you were asking about building up, you know, as we're building up month by month and leading to the sixth anniversary and beyond and that's a really important thing because
[02:25:35.444 --> 02:25:45.432]  We haven't really been focusing on themes or anything when we first started off with this campaign two months ago, but we are going to be encouraging more and more that people join in with a theme.
[02:25:45.472 --> 02:25:54.919]  For instance, May 11th, we're talking about getting people everywhere all across the country to do demonstrations outside of mass media outlets.
[02:25:55.059 --> 02:25:56.340]  Oh, that's a key question!
[02:25:56.380 --> 02:25:57.261]  What about April 11th?
[02:25:58.208 --> 02:26:02.131]  Well, April 11th, a lot of different places are doing different things.
[02:26:02.171 --> 02:26:05.152]  Here in San Francisco, we're going to be demonstrating in front of City Hall.
[02:26:05.172 --> 02:26:10.516]  We're going to be doing a demo at the Federal Building and KRON-TV News.
[02:26:10.536 --> 02:26:16.059]  In New York City, they're going to be doing three locations next Wednesday on April 11th.
[02:26:16.079 --> 02:26:19.702]  They're going to be doing Ground Zero, Times Square, and
[02:26:20.845 --> 02:26:24.267]  ABC Studios, another support demo for Rosie.
[02:26:24.347 --> 02:26:26.427]  Luke's going to be doing that out in New York City.
[02:26:26.547 --> 02:26:34.711]  And on June 11th, we're talking about getting everyone, as many states as possible, having demos at state capitals on June 11th.
[02:26:35.291 --> 02:26:39.533]  So, mass media outlets, May 11th, state capitals, June 11th.
[02:26:40.393 --> 02:26:42.874]  Alright, on September 11th, I'm going to be in New York.
[02:26:42.934 --> 02:26:43.735]  I want to see you there.
[02:26:43.775 --> 02:26:45.195]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:26:45.215 --> 02:26:46.296]  Let's jam in one more call.
[02:26:46.356 --> 02:26:47.096]  Mike in Florida.
[02:26:47.136 --> 02:26:47.777]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:26:47.937 --> 02:26:48.477]  Yeah!
[02:26:50.377 --> 02:26:50.678]  Mike!
[02:26:51.158 --> 02:26:51.819]  Yeah, how you doing?
[02:26:52.519 --> 02:26:53.220]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:26:53.240 --> 02:26:54.101]  Alright, hey.
[02:26:54.501 --> 02:26:58.184]  I just want to call and I want to say that I support Cosmos and everything he's doing.
[02:26:58.224 --> 02:26:58.945]  I think it's great.
[02:26:58.985 --> 02:27:00.266]  I think it's long overdue.
[02:27:00.326 --> 02:27:01.767]  You know, I get it all the time.
[02:27:01.827 --> 02:27:05.150]  I get a lot of people that say, you know, okay, well now what can I do, you know?
[02:27:05.170 --> 02:27:06.532]  And I think this is great.
[02:27:06.572 --> 02:27:10.835]  I think it gives them that outlet to, you know, organize with people in their area.
[02:27:10.935 --> 02:27:12.497]  I get a feeling you guys know each other.
[02:27:12.757 --> 02:27:14.178]  Yeah, Mike's a good guy.
[02:27:14.238 --> 02:27:14.939]  Mike's the man.
[02:27:14.979 --> 02:27:15.960]  We're talking to the man here.
[02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:16.801]  Mike from Florida.
[02:27:17.421 --> 02:27:20.962]  Well, I'll tell you what, let's just do a few more minutes on the other side.
[02:27:20.982 --> 02:27:24.262]  I've got to get into the economy and some other news, but this is important.
[02:27:24.283 --> 02:27:25.543]  9-11 truth is the key.
[02:27:26.023 --> 02:27:27.003]  Big push right now.
[02:27:27.643 --> 02:27:28.403]  Stay there, gentlemen.
[02:27:28.423 --> 02:27:30.044]  We'll come back and let you guys banter a bit.
[02:27:30.544 --> 02:27:31.584]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:33.705 --> 02:27:34.625]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.065 --> 02:27:36.685]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.605 --> 02:27:40.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.857 --> 02:27:44.818]  How are you doing today?

[02:28:36.717 --> 02:28:37.017]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[02:28:45.043 --> 02:28:45.603]  We're good to go.
[02:29:15.467 --> 02:29:17.949]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[02:29:18.409 --> 02:29:20.310]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:29:21.031 --> 02:29:24.213]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:29:24.854 --> 02:29:31.318]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:29:32.119 --> 02:29:34.320]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:29:34.701 --> 02:29:35.141]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:35.221 --> 02:29:36.602]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:29:45.086 --> 02:29:45.486]  Attention!
[02:29:45.606 --> 02:29:48.427]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:29:48.707 --> 02:29:53.027]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:29:53.327 --> 02:29:54.028]  Listen closely.
[02:29:54.668 --> 02:30:02.149]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:30:02.429 --> 02:30:11.210]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:30:11.510 --> 02:30:14.451]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[02:30:14.691 --> 02:30:15.191]  We're good to go.
[02:30:52.067 --> 02:31:13.664]  You know, let's go out of this segment with Johnny Cash.
[02:31:15.245 --> 02:31:19.709]  Pretty soon, one of these days, God's going to cut you down, or cut you down, whatever the name of the song is.
[02:31:20.436 --> 02:31:24.598]  I got a two and a half minute preview clip of a new film called The Reflecting Pool.
[02:31:24.678 --> 02:31:25.439]  It's a drama.
[02:31:25.939 --> 02:31:27.500]  It looks like it's got a pretty good budget.
[02:31:28.381 --> 02:31:30.542]  We just learned of this on 9-11 Truth.
[02:31:30.862 --> 02:31:33.583]  Cosmos, have you heard of this film, The Reflecting Pool?
[02:31:33.824 --> 02:31:34.804]  Yeah, I saw something about it.
[02:31:34.824 --> 02:31:36.865]  I think I watched the trailer last week.
[02:31:36.905 --> 02:31:37.866]  It looks pretty interesting.
[02:31:38.738 --> 02:31:52.501]  I tell you, man, the 9-11 truth has exploded, and it's a chain reaction where it's like an ammo dump blows up, and then blows up the base next to it, and then blows up the whole town, and then blows up the whole region and the whole planet.
[02:31:53.001 --> 02:31:57.182]  I mean, I think right now, the battle's going to be joined.
[02:31:57.202 --> 02:31:58.543]  We're on the collision course.
[02:31:59.103 --> 02:32:00.103]  They're in deep trouble.
[02:32:00.863 --> 02:32:03.884]  Now the only question is, will it explode big enough to bring them down?
[02:32:04.594 --> 02:32:10.316]  Well, it's gotta, and we gotta make it happen, and it's not like a question that we can just ask and wait for the answer.
[02:32:10.376 --> 02:32:11.436]  We gotta make the answer.
[02:32:11.456 --> 02:32:12.536]  We gotta get out in the street.
[02:32:12.556 --> 02:32:13.456]  We gotta take action.
[02:32:13.476 --> 02:32:14.517]  We gotta talk to our neighbors.
[02:32:14.557 --> 02:32:16.097]  We gotta duplicate DVDs.
[02:32:16.677 --> 02:32:18.238]  You know, all of that, and just do it.
[02:32:18.578 --> 02:32:19.798]  We've gotta have the will.
[02:32:19.938 --> 02:32:21.359]  We've gotta have to want it.
[02:32:21.779 --> 02:32:27.160]  We have to get that eye of the tiger, that focus, and just go in there and kick butt and take names.
[02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:28.381]  I mean, that's just how you do it.
[02:32:29.061 --> 02:32:29.541]  Exactly.
[02:32:30.223 --> 02:32:32.524]  Intensify firepower to the forward batteries.
[02:32:33.004 --> 02:32:40.347]  I want to ask all your listeners, please go to the truthaction.org forum now and go to the April 11th forum and sign up.
[02:32:40.487 --> 02:32:42.928]  Sign your location up for an action on April 11th.
[02:32:42.988 --> 02:32:43.949]  Get involved now.
[02:32:44.309 --> 02:32:44.869]  Absolutely.
[02:32:45.189 --> 02:32:51.372]  Listen, I got to go to this final call because I've absolutely got to cover these other news reports here.
[02:32:51.712 --> 02:32:53.112]  It's been fantastic having you on.
[02:32:53.372 --> 02:32:55.953]  Let's go ahead and let your friend Mike and you from Florida.
[02:32:56.273 --> 02:32:57.314]  Mike, tell us about yourself.
[02:32:58.208 --> 02:33:03.010]  Well, I had a question that I wanted to ask you a while back, but I don't get to listen to you as much as I'd like to.
[02:33:04.090 --> 02:33:05.610]  When I went to Washington, D.C.
[02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:09.231]  for the Peace March they had back in January.
[02:33:09.291 --> 02:33:10.852]  It was on the 27th, I believe.
[02:33:11.852 --> 02:33:17.574]  The day after, United for Peace and Justice held these workshops out at this high school in Bethesda.
[02:33:17.734 --> 02:33:20.175]  They had this big auditorium full of peace activist people.
[02:33:20.885 --> 02:33:24.287]  This guy, David Swenson, came on and started talking about investigations.
[02:33:24.487 --> 02:33:25.347]  And they shut him down.
[02:33:25.367 --> 02:33:26.088]  I've seen the video.
[02:33:26.408 --> 02:33:27.809]  Yeah, and I stood up.
[02:33:27.909 --> 02:33:34.512]  I was the guy that stood up in the crowd and was like, you know, listen, why are we talking about all this stuff when we can't talk about the 9-11 truth movement?
[02:33:34.872 --> 02:33:38.114]  You know, and the same thing happened with Amy Goodman.
[02:33:38.134 --> 02:33:43.837]  She came down here to my town where I live in Melbourne, Florida, and she was speaking at FIT, you know, so I came there.
[02:33:43.877 --> 02:33:46.438]  I got a seat there and came and confronted her the same thing.
[02:33:47.031 --> 02:33:59.461]  You know, and I've taken some slack from some of my friends in the peace movement and stuff, but my opinion and my idea on this is that I think we need to get the people that are in the peace movement more involved and turn them out.
[02:33:59.621 --> 02:34:00.902]  They're absolutely pathetic.
[02:34:00.922 --> 02:34:02.243]  Let me break this down.
[02:34:02.303 --> 02:34:05.745]  Number one, when Clinton attacked Serbia, they loved it, most of them.
[02:34:06.226 --> 02:34:10.109]  Number two, once the Democrats get in, most of them are going to go back into hibernation.
[02:34:10.729 --> 02:34:14.692]  And we need to explain to them that they are totally controlled by Ford Foundation groups.
[02:34:15.073 --> 02:34:16.674]  Amy Goodman is a complete joke.
[02:34:17.414 --> 02:34:24.298]  And they're there to keep you pacified and to think that everything's being handled and to keep you from taking action.
[02:34:24.779 --> 02:34:26.079]  And it's disgusting.
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:35.905]  The members of it at the mid-level are a bunch of wannabe cowards who are afraid of their message being diluted or discredited.
[02:34:35.945 --> 02:34:37.106]  They're a bunch of scum.
[02:34:37.866 --> 02:34:40.988]  And listen, there is no real peace movement in this country.
[02:34:41.288 --> 02:34:43.450]  If you want one, you gotta take it over!
[02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:59.300]  So I'd go to these peace meetings, and I'd get up, and I'd get up with a bullhorn, and I'd say, anybody who wants the truth, meet me outside, I'll give you a flyer, my phone number, we'll form a real group now, we'll start addressing government narcotics trafficking, we'll start addressing government-sponsored terror, we'll start
[02:34:59.480 --> 02:35:00.581]  Yeah, amen to that.
[02:35:00.701 --> 02:35:02.783]  I have one more question.
[02:35:02.843 --> 02:35:05.585]  I was in September 11th with you guys last year in New York.
[02:35:05.605 --> 02:35:06.186]  I mean on September 11th.
[02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:36.314]  I was on a radio show with Kevin Barrett and Dylan Avery about a month or two ago, and Dylan made a comment that he thought that they were going to be starting construction down there, and he wasn't sure if it was going to be an event like it was last year due to the construction and stuff.
[02:35:36.334 --> 02:35:37.355]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:35:38.516 --> 02:35:40.037]  Well, so what if there's construction?
[02:35:40.097 --> 02:35:43.180]  We can go to wherever the barricades are and have it there.
[02:35:43.240 --> 02:35:44.942]  We'll all just meet where everybody's meeting up.
[02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:46.251]  Well, that's all I had to hear.
[02:35:46.311 --> 02:35:49.593]  I'll start spreading the word for that, and you can guarantee I'll be there.
[02:35:49.753 --> 02:35:52.896]  Yeah, I'm going to New York on September 11th for the 6th anniversary.
[02:35:53.156 --> 02:35:53.356]  Yeah.
[02:35:53.636 --> 02:35:54.277]  You better believe it.
[02:35:54.297 --> 02:35:55.578]  We're going to be there again, my brother.
[02:35:55.598 --> 02:35:56.238]  Alright.
[02:35:56.618 --> 02:35:57.439]  I want to see you there.
[02:35:57.499 --> 02:35:58.480]  Thank you so much.
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:00.121]  Alright, I'm sorry to Tim and everybody else.
[02:36:00.141 --> 02:36:01.702]  I'll get to you in the final segment if I have time.
[02:36:01.742 --> 02:36:02.442]  Tim, John, and others.
[02:36:03.063 --> 02:36:04.024]  Cosmos, great job.
[02:36:04.064 --> 02:36:04.964]  Great job on that video.
[02:36:05.024 --> 02:36:10.048]  Everybody should go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com and see the video of the third stage.
[02:36:10.388 --> 02:36:11.829]  The website is TruthAction.org.
[02:36:11.869 --> 02:36:12.570]  Take care, my friend.
[02:36:13.071 --> 02:36:13.812]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:36:13.872 --> 02:36:15.436]  God bless you and your family and your crew.
[02:36:15.696 --> 02:36:17.701]  Thank you, and you guys are great activists.
[02:36:17.721 --> 02:36:18.342]  Do me a favor.
[02:36:18.542 --> 02:36:20.086]  Help get TerrorStorm out there to people.
[02:36:20.647 --> 02:36:21.469]  We always do.
[02:36:21.529 --> 02:36:23.313]  We're always handing out copies of TerrorStorm.
[02:36:24.266 --> 02:36:30.550]  Well, you're awesome, because earlier you were telling me how much you liked it, and I thought, well, why don't I just have The Activist plug it, because I've got to plug it occasionally or it won't get out there.
[02:36:30.690 --> 02:36:32.571]  Yeah, everybody, buy Terror Storm.
[02:36:32.631 --> 02:36:34.232]  I bought multiple copies of Terror Storm.
[02:36:34.272 --> 02:36:45.079]  I sent one to my dad, I sent one to my friend in Texas, I sent one to, you know, all kinds of people, and then, you know, then we duplicate copies and hand them out on the 11th, we give out, like... But I want your real, I mean, I want your real take on Terror Storm.
[02:36:46.279 --> 02:37:09.405]  Well, Terror Storm, you know, it's such a special movie because, you know, it's the only movie out there that really addresses this history of false flag terrorism, which is this key mechanism that the state has used to control populations for so long, and it really, you know, gives people such an important piece of what's going on behind this, you know, the 9-11 and, you know, whatever they're...
[02:37:10.365 --> 02:37:11.386]  Well, that's what we do.
[02:37:11.406 --> 02:37:12.788]  I mean, that's what we do.
[02:37:12.808 --> 02:37:21.038]  There's a lot of great films out there, and they're all very effective, and we love them, including Road to Tyranny, and he gets into some history, and Martial Law and Loose Change.
[02:37:21.098 --> 02:37:23.441]  All of them are 9-11 mystery demolitions.
[02:37:23.801 --> 02:37:26.464]  But Terror Storm shows you the admissions.
[02:37:26.845 --> 02:37:30.329]  There's no debating in that first 25 minutes of the two-hour film.
[02:37:31.096 --> 02:37:36.401]  Yeah, I mean, Terror Storm is a very, very important part of the piece that, you know, that we've got to inform people.
[02:37:36.421 --> 02:37:48.992]  I think if you really want to give people the knockout 9-11 truth punch, you give them a copy of Terror Storm, a copy of 9-11 Press for Truth, and a copy of 9-11 Mysteries, all together, and, you know, they won't come back the same.
[02:37:50.285 --> 02:37:54.267]  In fact, a lot of folks, Luke was doing that down at ABC Studios a few weeks ago.
[02:37:54.808 --> 02:37:55.488]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:37:56.089 --> 02:37:56.409]  Always.
[02:37:56.449 --> 02:37:57.850]  Well listen, good job, good hearing from you.
[02:37:57.870 --> 02:37:58.610]  We'll have you back on.
[02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.931]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:38:00.071 --> 02:38:00.671]  You bet, my friend.
[02:38:00.691 --> 02:38:01.492]  There goes Cosmos.
[02:38:01.532 --> 02:38:04.934]  And again, shout out to Scott Noble who put together that video.
[02:38:05.714 --> 02:38:06.975]  Just absolutely incredible.
[02:38:07.676 --> 02:38:08.096]  Okay.
[02:38:09.777 --> 02:38:10.577]  I'm like wheezing.
[02:38:10.617 --> 02:38:12.338]  I am so sick of this oak pollen, folks.
[02:38:12.418 --> 02:38:16.001]  It has really... I never knew allergies were so bad.
[02:38:16.281 --> 02:38:17.762]  I hear myself wheezing in the microphone.
[02:38:17.782 --> 02:38:19.603]  I just want you to know I don't have emphysema.
[02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:19.963]  Hold on.
[02:38:22.671 --> 02:38:26.955]  Man, there's no bees to get the pollen anymore, folks.
[02:38:28.176 --> 02:38:30.257]  I mean, there's literally like inches of it on the ground.
[02:38:30.317 --> 02:38:31.258]  It's like biblical.
[02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:34.641]  Something's wrong with the earth, folks.
[02:38:34.661 --> 02:38:36.322]  People didn't have these allergies 20 years ago.
[02:38:36.503 --> 02:38:38.724]  Everybody's got them now, especially here.
[02:38:38.744 --> 02:38:42.407]  It's just a little bit of me kind of getting lightheaded there for a second.
[02:38:42.427 --> 02:38:42.728]  Hold on.
[02:38:45.430 --> 02:38:46.010]  Ah, there we go.
[02:38:49.966 --> 02:38:53.007]  Your sinus swells up to the size of a grapefruit and gives you a headache.
[02:38:53.107 --> 02:38:56.689]  Okay, um, there's so much news.
[02:38:56.749 --> 02:38:57.149]  You know what?
[02:38:57.189 --> 02:39:02.171]  Let's go ahead and play this, uh, while I regroup and get the news together here in front of me.
[02:39:02.831 --> 02:39:07.293]  Let's go ahead and play this little two-and-a-half-minute trailer to, uh, this 9-11 reflecting pool.
[02:39:07.593 --> 02:39:08.514]  That reflecting pool.
[02:39:09.274 --> 02:39:13.516]  And, uh, this is a drama, but with the real facts of 9-11 put into it that's coming out.
[02:39:13.536 --> 02:39:13.816]  Here it is.
[02:39:21.096 --> 02:39:24.037]  It's about why we can't get simple questions answered.
[02:39:24.237 --> 02:39:29.998]  And if we don't ask those questions, they can appropriate an event like 9-11 to match anything they want to do.
[02:39:30.659 --> 02:39:36.020]  We're back with Alex Prokop, a Russian-born Los Angeles-based author of Now You See It.
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:38.001]  Welcome to Bare Facts, Alex.
[02:39:38.421 --> 02:39:39.421]  Pleasure to be here, Jack.
[02:39:40.095 --> 02:39:43.317]  My daughter died on the plane that crashed into the North Tower.
[02:39:43.357 --> 02:39:44.518]  The floor started collapsing.
[02:39:44.638 --> 02:39:44.958]  Bam!
[02:39:45.018 --> 02:39:45.318]  Bam!
[02:39:45.398 --> 02:39:45.739]  Bam!
[02:39:46.119 --> 02:39:47.180]  I don't deal with theories.
[02:39:47.680 --> 02:39:49.181]  Especially conspiracy theories.
[02:39:49.221 --> 02:39:50.281]  Just look at the facts of it.
[02:39:50.341 --> 02:39:56.185]  We have information that one of your reporters is working on an article pertinent to the 9-11 attacks.
[02:39:56.205 --> 02:39:59.007]  I guess it's pertinent enough for the FBI to pay me a visit.
[02:39:59.487 --> 02:40:00.528]  You wanna take on the meth?
[02:40:01.068 --> 02:40:02.209]  You gotta have some evidence.
[02:40:02.229 --> 02:40:03.229]  You gotta have facts.
[02:40:03.249 --> 02:40:06.490]  Did you tell about these underground explosions to the 9-11 Commission?
[02:40:06.610 --> 02:40:09.051]  Our testimony was not allowed to be included in the final report.
[02:40:09.512 --> 02:40:14.154]  The report is simply downplaying the design of a building to support their own theory of the collapse.
[02:40:14.354 --> 02:40:18.896]  It's bigger than me, you, and Sarah, and all the other families.
[02:40:18.916 --> 02:40:21.056]  It's about much larger things.
[02:40:21.897 --> 02:40:23.618]  I don't give a damn if I lose my job over it.
[02:40:23.658 --> 02:40:24.178]  I was there.
[02:40:25.698 --> 02:40:28.700]  On that weekend, I saw those people and I saw what happened Tuesday.
[02:40:30.143 --> 02:40:31.644]  I know, there's gotta be a connection.
[02:40:31.664 --> 02:40:35.106]  On September the 11th, NORAD was conducting war games.
[02:40:35.707 --> 02:40:38.469]  They were training for a possible terrorist attack.
[02:40:38.889 --> 02:40:40.010]  I don't know what to believe.
[02:40:40.030 --> 02:40:44.252]  You know what the trouble is with conspiracy theorists, Jack?
[02:40:44.833 --> 02:40:48.635]  They can't accept the fact that large things can have very simple explanations.
[02:40:49.356 --> 02:40:55.820]  Every time you come here, and you tell me how old she would have been, and how she had every right to live.
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:40:59.863]  Well, it takes an enormous amount of planning to bring a building like that down.
[02:41:01.002 --> 02:41:03.727]  Building 7 must have been rigged for demolition in advance.
[02:41:03.747 --> 02:41:06.311]  So were the Twin Towers.
[02:41:07.353 --> 02:41:09.897]  There was no failure of intelligence on 9-11.
[02:41:11.463 --> 02:41:13.364]  There was a deliberate failure to act.
[02:41:13.464 --> 02:41:17.707]  Maybe you should just let your viewers decide instead of feeding them your opinion.
[02:41:17.747 --> 02:41:19.248]  Well, I'll give you my opinion right now!
[02:41:19.408 --> 02:41:19.868]  Shut up!
[02:41:20.289 --> 02:41:31.255]  I don't believe the greatest air power in the world could fail so miserably and so conveniently four times on a single day without someone giving an order to fail.
[02:41:31.656 --> 02:41:34.417]  If 9-11 didn't exist, they'd have to create one.
[02:41:35.038 --> 02:41:37.739]  And maybe they did, but it doesn't make any difference now.
[02:41:43.744 --> 02:41:46.185]  Alright, I wanted to get into this today and I should do a whole show on it.
[02:41:46.205 --> 02:41:49.006]  You know what, Sunday I think I'm going to talk about it, but I've got to write notes up on this.
[02:41:49.026 --> 02:41:52.508]  You know, I've got a show four to six, just a two hour show on Sundays is pretty good.
[02:41:52.928 --> 02:41:55.189]  You can listen on some of the MNFM stations that are picking it up.
[02:41:55.229 --> 02:41:56.489]  I think it's like 15 stations now.
[02:41:56.889 --> 02:41:58.610]  We need to get some more affiliates, but it's growing nicely.
[02:41:58.630 --> 02:41:59.810]  We've been doing it about six months now.
[02:41:59.830 --> 02:42:02.371]  Yeah, it's out of the studios at KLBJ 590.
[02:42:02.651 --> 02:42:09.494]  You can hear it from southern Oklahoma down to the coast and down to Mexico when it's at full power during the day when I'm on.
[02:42:09.514 --> 02:42:09.574]  590 AM.
[02:42:12.854 --> 02:42:15.036]  Uh... but uh... maybe I'll get into it.
[02:42:15.176 --> 02:42:16.638]  I'll spend more time on this then.
[02:42:16.758 --> 02:42:20.961]  Thirteen-year-old arrested in school for writing on desk.
[02:42:21.522 --> 02:42:22.763]  This is New York Channel 13 CBS.
[02:42:22.783 --> 02:42:26.727]  I mean, it says CBS and 13 next to it.
[02:42:26.767 --> 02:42:32.932]  It's actually thirteen-year-old arrested in school for writing on desk.
[02:42:33.272 --> 02:42:35.374]  Principals urge cops to arrest girl for writing OK.
[02:42:37.265 --> 02:42:47.532]  Turns out she's a good student with no disciplinary history, but they're under surveillance in the classrooms and she scribbled and she was arrested within, she was detained and then arrested within seconds.
[02:42:47.612 --> 02:42:48.352]  I mean, they were on her.
[02:42:49.693 --> 02:43:01.321]  And I don't know how many times I was daydreaming or wasn't thinking of withdrawing my desk and I'd sit there and wet my finger with spit and you know, clean it off or the teacher a few times would say, hey Alex, clean that up.
[02:43:02.181 --> 02:43:03.122]  Not anymore folks!
[02:43:05.119 --> 02:43:06.700]  I mean, it's over.
[02:43:06.760 --> 02:43:12.141]  You're going to jail.
[02:43:12.221 --> 02:43:13.361]  It said they're charging her.
[02:43:13.381 --> 02:43:17.763]  I don't have time to go into what they're charging her with.
[02:43:18.183 --> 02:43:19.323]  But she was arrested.
[02:43:19.363 --> 02:43:20.883]  She was taken to jail.
[02:43:20.903 --> 02:43:23.724]  And I forget what it is.
[02:43:23.784 --> 02:43:24.764]  It's here in the article.
[02:43:24.844 --> 02:43:26.125]  It's two different charges.
[02:43:27.365 --> 02:43:30.666]  But she is going to be on probation here.
[02:43:30.706 --> 02:43:32.387]  It says she was handcuffed, taken to jail.
[02:43:32.407 --> 02:43:33.127]  I don't have time.
[02:43:33.167 --> 02:43:33.827]  I'm just out of time.
[02:43:34.760 --> 02:43:36.642]  You can just type in 13-year-old arrested in school.
[02:43:37.322 --> 02:43:37.863]  Here's another one.
[02:43:37.923 --> 02:43:41.205]  Neglectful dog owners could face prison.
[02:43:42.606 --> 02:43:47.130]  And it says owners of fat dogs could face prosecution under animal welfare law.
[02:43:47.430 --> 02:43:49.612]  See, now it's your kid's a little overweight, gonna take them.
[02:43:49.892 --> 02:43:51.493]  Your dog's overweight, you're gonna be arrested.
[02:43:51.694 --> 02:43:53.255]  You're on your cell phone, you're gonna be arrested.
[02:43:54.616 --> 02:43:58.199]  Oh, in Florida, we're gonna read all your license plates with the license plate reading scanner.
[02:43:58.239 --> 02:43:58.419]  See?
[02:43:58.719 --> 02:43:59.760]  Going nationwide now.
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:01.281]  Federally funded Homeland Security.
[02:44:02.182 --> 02:44:03.543]  But they can't check the border
[02:44:05.097 --> 02:44:06.337]  They can't control things there.
[02:44:06.398 --> 02:44:07.538]  They can't do anything about that.
[02:44:07.558 --> 02:44:12.019]  I'm like Darth Vader here with this in my lungs like this.
[02:44:12.039 --> 02:44:12.340]  Sorry.
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:16.661]  So, this is just ongoing.
[02:44:17.221 --> 02:44:19.722]  And remember Brooksville, Florida?
[02:44:19.742 --> 02:44:20.743]  $5 ticket you haven't paid.
[02:44:20.763 --> 02:44:21.963]  They just come and take your house.
[02:44:22.363 --> 02:44:23.043]  First offense.
[02:44:23.924 --> 02:44:24.544]  Just type it in.
[02:44:24.584 --> 02:44:26.244]  Take your home for unpaid parking ticket.
[02:44:26.264 --> 02:44:26.244]  $5.
[02:44:26.284 --> 02:44:30.406]  I've got stacks of these articles today.
[02:44:32.873 --> 02:44:36.017]  And here's the big story I should have talked about all day and should have promoted.
[02:44:39.242 --> 02:44:40.964]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:44:42.246 --> 02:44:43.908]  Osama or the Easter Bunny?
[02:44:44.288 --> 02:44:48.955]  Who will be paying us a visit this weekend by Steve Watson?
[02:44:49.981 --> 02:44:56.225]  CENTCOM has, and by the way, we know they flipped the switch two days ago with the Iran thing unraveling for them.
[02:44:56.885 --> 02:45:16.197]  In my stack, I've probably got fifteen articles, I didn't count them, where Al-Qaeda's gonna hit, they were gonna blow up the Eiffel Tower, they were gonna blow up Big Ben, they were gonna attack Parliament, they're gonna attack the U.S., Al-Qaeda's about to attack England, Al-Qaeda's about to attack Iraq, Iran's with Al-Qaeda, Saddam's with Al-Qaeda, Cheney gives a speech, we know Saddam was Al-Qaeda, we know he attacked on 9-11.
[02:45:16.517 --> 02:45:18.699]  They're back saying it after President Bush said it isn't the case.
[02:45:19.279 --> 02:45:20.140]  They flipped the switch.
[02:45:20.180 --> 02:45:21.101]  That's the new propaganda.
[02:45:21.121 --> 02:45:22.483]  We're going to be hit by terrorists any minute.
[02:45:22.703 --> 02:45:26.728]  They'll probably have us up on orange alerts by the end of the week because they're in deep trouble.
[02:45:30.372 --> 02:45:35.659]  Osama or the Easter Bunny, who will be paying us a visit this weekend?
[02:45:37.583 --> 02:45:44.327]  And it goes on to say, SimCom has reliably informed us that the Easter Bunny's appearance this year may be upstaging that of Goldstein himself.
[02:45:44.707 --> 02:45:46.668]  That's a 1984 connection.
[02:45:47.808 --> 02:45:49.549]  The Back from the Dead of Osama Bin Laden.
[02:45:50.210 --> 02:45:53.031]  And it says, the Jihadist website carried the following posting.
[02:45:53.751 --> 02:45:59.494]  And the sheik of the Mujahideen, Bin Laden, will be coming out with a new video.
[02:45:59.895 --> 02:46:00.335]  Now the last
[02:46:01.229 --> 02:46:02.891]  More than 10 times they release videos.
[02:46:03.271 --> 02:46:05.973]  I could look at it and see how much the video has been on since 2000.
[02:46:06.514 --> 02:46:08.576]  It's a 1999-2000 video, re-edited.
[02:46:08.816 --> 02:46:09.997]  And the Feds re-edit it.
[02:46:10.017 --> 02:46:12.379]  They even release it on government finance websites.
[02:46:12.459 --> 02:46:14.301]  And it always leads back to the government, back of the paper.
[02:46:14.881 --> 02:46:15.662]  And it doesn't matter.
[02:46:15.722 --> 02:46:17.804]  They now admit that the British were in Iranian waters.
[02:46:17.844 --> 02:46:18.464]  That's now admitted.
[02:46:18.845 --> 02:46:19.785]  But it's the back of the paper.
[02:46:19.805 --> 02:46:21.867]  And it's now admitted they were getting intelligence, back of the paper.
[02:46:22.348 --> 02:46:24.510]  And it's now admitted it was all a war provocation, back of the paper.
[02:46:25.050 --> 02:46:25.771]  And it just doesn't matter.
[02:46:27.372 --> 02:46:28.353]  Again, that's how they operate.
[02:46:29.551 --> 02:46:35.692]  But this Osama Bin Laden, or the Easter Bunny story, is really good.
[02:46:35.732 --> 02:46:36.752]  You should get it out to everybody.
[02:46:37.172 --> 02:46:38.653]  But which Osama will it be?
[02:46:38.793 --> 02:46:40.053]  The fat-nosed Bin Laden?
[02:46:40.553 --> 02:46:41.933]  The fuzzy, blurry Bin Laden?
[02:46:42.133 --> 02:46:45.574]  Or the regurgitated, cobbled-together Bin Laden medley?
[02:46:48.394 --> 02:46:56.496]  And don't forget, they used video as a so-called Al-Qaeda confession from a made-for-TV movie that had already aired on television worldwide.
[02:46:57.048 --> 02:46:58.169]  Remember that last year?
[02:46:58.189 --> 02:47:00.190]  Steve did a story on that, and it went supernova.
[02:47:00.430 --> 02:47:03.232]  He ought to redo that story, add new stuff, and put that back out.
[02:47:03.672 --> 02:47:04.833]  That thing got a lot of attention.
[02:47:05.153 --> 02:47:08.235]  I mean, they air made-for-TV movies on the news saying it's al-Qaeda.
[02:47:08.515 --> 02:47:10.496]  And then retract it a month later.
[02:47:11.196 --> 02:47:11.937]  It doesn't matter.
[02:47:11.977 --> 02:47:13.818]  They retract it, but it's in the back of the paper.
[02:47:14.178 --> 02:47:16.179]  Do you read the retraction section of the paper?
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:18.881]  They got made-for-TV movies on, folks.
[02:47:20.542 --> 02:47:25.605]  Clips out of made-for-TV movies that it turns out they used in a secret trial
[02:47:26.374 --> 02:47:29.476]  And then the footage originally, it said, was produced by the government.
[02:47:30.217 --> 02:47:34.560]  I mean, folks, you just can't make this stuff up.
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:37.222]  It's so off the charts.
[02:47:39.023 --> 02:47:39.923]  You watch the news.
[02:47:40.244 --> 02:47:42.986]  I mean, even people who think they're savvy think, oh, there's propaganda on the news.
[02:47:43.006 --> 02:47:45.487]  But it's, you know, it's a liberal or conservative propaganda.
[02:47:45.507 --> 02:47:45.808]  Folks.
[02:47:49.550 --> 02:47:51.151]  Yeah, let's go ahead and roll out with this song.
[02:47:52.112 --> 02:47:53.273]  We'll be right back.
[02:47:53.313 --> 02:47:54.894]  And I'll get into, I said I'd get into the economy.
[02:47:55.712 --> 02:47:58.813]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:47:59.353 --> 02:48:01.754]  Run on for a long time.
[02:48:02.314 --> 02:48:04.415]  Run on for a long time.
[02:48:05.155 --> 02:48:07.596]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:48:08.136 --> 02:48:10.477]  Sooner or later gotta cut you down.
[02:48:12.683 --> 02:48:15.105]  Go tell that long tongue liar.
[02:48:15.646 --> 02:48:17.927]  Go and tell that midnight rider.
[02:48:18.528 --> 02:48:21.631]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the back biter.
[02:48:22.031 --> 02:48:24.513]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[02:48:24.893 --> 02:48:27.495]  Tell him that God's gonna cut him down.
[02:48:32.575 --> 02:48:35.297]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news.
[02:48:35.697 --> 02:48:38.219]  My head's been whipped with the midnight dew.
[02:48:38.759 --> 02:48:49.847]  I've been down on bended knee, talking to the man from... It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:50.187 --> 02:48:52.129]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:52.489 --> 02:49:00.094]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:00.825 --> 02:49:07.888]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.268 --> 02:49:19.693]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.013 --> 02:49:23.855]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:23.975 --> 02:49:25.896]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.236 --> 02:49:30.078]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:17.529 --> 02:51:17.809]  I'm good.
[02:51:46.016 --> 02:51:48.197]  What would you do if you knew?
[02:51:48.477 --> 02:51:50.677]  You're all I can bring you.
[02:51:51.198 --> 02:51:53.738]  Would you stand up for true?
[02:51:53.798 --> 02:51:56.179]  What would you turn away to?
[02:51:56.619 --> 02:51:58.699]  And then what if you saw?
[02:51:59.239 --> 02:52:01.600]  All of the things that's wrong?
[02:52:01.660 --> 02:52:03.720]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[02:52:04.361 --> 02:52:05.741]  Or would you turn away?
[02:52:07.745 --> 02:52:09.487]  I got a message for the government.
[02:52:10.188 --> 02:52:13.912]  We'll just play the first little stanza and then I gotta get into the analysis of the economy.
[02:52:14.252 --> 02:52:16.575]  Won't even have time to plug videos, but that's okay.
[02:52:25.154 --> 02:52:26.014]  Welcome back!
[02:52:49.102 --> 02:52:51.383]  Okay, earlier I got into what's happening with the economy.
[02:52:51.423 --> 02:53:06.652]  They've slowly taken over the currency, they've debased the value of the nation, they have driven the value of the dollar down to almost nothing, so foreign companies can come in and buy up the infrastructure, literally for pennies on the dollar, and that's the best case scenario.
[02:53:06.712 --> 02:53:10.795]  Normally they're just going to pay off a few politicians, and it's like pennies on the hundred dollars.
[02:53:11.767 --> 02:53:13.388]  I mean, we're talking about tiny investments.
[02:53:14.049 --> 02:53:20.274]  And then they just hand over the water districts, the lakes, the power plants, the infrastructure, the regulations.
[02:53:20.895 --> 02:53:25.418]  Lockheed Martin's running most of the red light cameras and face scanners.
[02:53:25.438 --> 02:53:28.421]  I mean, just the military neutral complex takes over nations.
[02:53:29.081 --> 02:53:30.823]  And they said, well, we just take this country over.
[02:53:30.843 --> 02:53:32.104]  And they said, all right, let's do it.
[02:53:32.544 --> 02:53:35.326]  They ran an intelligence op on us, a black op, and took over.
[02:53:35.947 --> 02:53:38.509]  But they pumped up the bubble so big
[02:53:41.528 --> 02:53:56.053]  There are hundreds and hundreds, and I mean, it's literally thousands, because I've seen the math before, of times, actual debts to what there is, paper currency, and many times what there is to even actual assets.
[02:53:58.274 --> 02:54:01.415]  I mean, they totally own us, folks, but it's done through fraud.
[02:54:02.115 --> 02:54:08.077]  If somebody falsely signs your signature to something, and then just has some thug try to enforce it, that's called mafia.
[02:54:08.678 --> 02:54:09.519]  This isn't real.
[02:54:09.579 --> 02:54:11.120]  We don't really own these bankers anything.
[02:54:11.360 --> 02:54:13.041]  This isn't real debt owed to them.
[02:54:14.302 --> 02:54:16.344]  Now, the elite isn't ready to pop the bubble right now.
[02:54:16.384 --> 02:54:22.949]  They're telling all these subprime lenders and all these arm lenders, adjustable rate mortgages, they're saying, you know what, you can't foreclose.
[02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:23.770]  We're not going to let you.
[02:54:24.150 --> 02:54:27.613]  Because they started foreclosing a few months ago and we were about to go into a depression right then.
[02:54:27.873 --> 02:54:31.716]  And the government is telling them, without having a public bailout, you're not allowed to.
[02:54:34.398 --> 02:54:37.260]  I was listening to BBC last night, driving home at 2 a.m.
[02:54:37.280 --> 02:54:38.401]  I'd already read the text report.
[02:54:38.441 --> 02:54:41.322]  I didn't know those BBC reports on the radio were just reading the news article.
[02:54:41.602 --> 02:54:47.226]  It was word for word, an article I'd just read minutes before, and where they were basically admitting all of this.
[02:54:48.647 --> 02:54:51.268]  But, you know why they haven't done that yet?
[02:54:51.808 --> 02:55:02.715]  They did it in 29, when people weren't over a barrel 1-100th like they are now, because they knew, they'd done their testing, they knew you were good, quiet people that would put up with it predominantly.
[02:55:03.348 --> 02:55:04.149]  Not now, folks.
[02:55:04.209 --> 02:55:07.951]  They know it is a mutated demon horde.
[02:55:09.092 --> 02:55:14.315]  In between that, millions of special forces train troops in public.
[02:55:14.395 --> 02:55:17.337]  A lot of people that are awake to them, but they're more worried about just the hordes.
[02:55:17.557 --> 02:55:24.461]  They tried to get riot cops and FEMA centers ready, but they're figuring out that we woke people up too quick that they're not going to be able to contain it.
[02:55:24.741 --> 02:55:25.922]  So go ahead, bozos!
[02:55:25.982 --> 02:55:26.982]  Pull the economy out!
[02:55:27.202 --> 02:55:29.004]  Go ahead and light the fuse, man!
[02:55:29.064 --> 02:55:31.265]  You are lighting a fuse that goes right up
[02:55:32.541 --> 02:55:34.323]  Right into your body, you fools.
[02:55:34.363 --> 02:55:36.465]  You dig a pit for us, you're going to fall into it.
[02:55:36.786 --> 02:55:39.108]  We're in for serious times, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:39.348 --> 02:55:42.531]  But the elite is actually trying to stop an implosion right now.
[02:55:43.032 --> 02:55:44.714]  I just gave you one indicator of hundreds.
[02:55:45.174 --> 02:55:48.097]  And that's because they know you're not going to go along with it.
[02:55:48.798 --> 02:55:55.705]  So we've got to get the word out now, like we have about government-sponsored terror, that it is the elite that is behind the financial implosion.
[02:55:56.932 --> 02:56:01.796]  It is the elite who have set up an economic system designed to get you in debt.
[02:56:01.856 --> 02:56:05.918]  And there's personal behavior as part of that too, but it was designed to allow that to happen.
[02:56:06.119 --> 02:56:12.783]  It was all fostered when the economic system was set up where more debt is created by the Federal Reserve than there is even currency.
[02:56:12.983 --> 02:56:13.284]  Okay?
[02:56:13.524 --> 02:56:15.245]  It's designed to black hole us.
[02:56:15.485 --> 02:56:16.706]  It's designed to implode us.
[02:56:16.846 --> 02:56:19.668]  And we just got to get that message out so people know who the enemy is.
[02:56:19.948 --> 02:56:20.689]  See you Sunday!
