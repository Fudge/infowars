[00:00:05.391 --> 00:00:09.573]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.054]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.814 --> 00:00:12.715]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:17.056]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.557 --> 00:00:21.679]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:27.041]  Welcome.
[00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:28.102]  We are live.
[00:00:28.202 --> 00:00:29.262]  It is July 5th, 2007.
[00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:44.820]  The nation's birthday has come and passed, and the press is reporting headline, North American Union Plan headed to Congress in the fall.
[00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.583]  Powerful think tank prepares report on benefits of integration between U.S., Mexico, and Canada.
[00:00:52.104 --> 00:01:00.688]  And just as with amnesty, they will deny it is a merger of the three nations, even if it passes, they will deny it.
[00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:02.326]  Even as U.S.
[00:01:02.906 --> 00:01:23.779]  businesses get their new tax codes that already say we're part of the North American Union, even as their own documents via FOIA request are released, that's Freedom of Information Act request, it will still be denied because this is military propaganda, military style.
[00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:32.271]  Denying that you're under bombardment even as they scream bombs away and the bombardier pulls the lever.
[00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:40.132]  Even as you hear the whistle of the 500-pound bombs coming down on your positions, they tell you, don't take cover!
[00:01:40.292 --> 00:01:41.713]  It's not an assault!
[00:01:42.353 --> 00:01:43.713]  It doesn't exist!
[00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:45.033]  Trust us!
[00:01:46.034 --> 00:01:47.094]  The good news is...
[00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:51.640]  The approval ratings went even lower this week.
[00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.163]  Even lower than what they were two weeks ago.
[00:01:55.183 --> 00:02:10.136]  This has now broken all previous records, shattered them, and the government has blown its cover as not being the government, and as being nothing but a pack of organized criminals.
[00:02:11.857 --> 00:02:12.618]  So we'll get into this.
[00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:16.521]  North American Union plan headed to Congress in the fall.
[00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:22.019]  Now we've got to spend the next few months just convincing people it exists.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.780]  Desperately.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.901]  So when they try to move it forward, we can shoot it down.
[00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:31.342]  Also, fed up with war, some won't pay taxes.
[00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:34.743]  Associated Press will be going over that growing movement.
[00:02:36.024 --> 00:02:39.345]  Not just with conservatives, classical patriots, but with liberals.
[00:02:40.482 --> 00:02:42.483]  Ratings for Bush, Congress, sink even lower.
[00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:44.463]  I mentioned that earlier as well from the AP.
[00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:47.284]  Big report out of the London Guardian.
[00:02:47.784 --> 00:02:48.704]  Made in China.
[00:02:48.804 --> 00:02:52.185]  Tainted food, fake drugs, and dodgy paint.
[00:02:52.565 --> 00:02:54.466]  Just how deep is the crisis?
[00:02:54.946 --> 00:02:56.986]  It's probably worse than even you thought.
[00:02:57.086 --> 00:03:03.608]  I know that when I actually saw the newest numbers out from the Chinese government itself, it was worse than I thought.
[00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:06.473]  I have a tendency to look at the media as hyping things.
[00:03:06.973 --> 00:03:11.234]  No, you can't hype something this big and this serious.
[00:03:13.335 --> 00:03:29.100]  But I want to open the main body of the broadcast up in the next segment with this report here in front of me because I went to the gym yesterday and I was thinking
[00:03:29.873 --> 00:03:31.214]  Basically, what's in this story?
[00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:40.523]  Well, I sat there for near an hour on an exercise bike, trying to sweat off my behemoth bulk.
[00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:48.591]  I had, what, five television sets in front of me that I could read the closed captioning on, and I could watch the crowd.
[00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.814]  The amount of intel gleaned there was substantive.
[00:03:56.246 --> 00:03:57.807]  And you're saying, what does it have to do with?
[00:03:57.867 --> 00:03:59.689]  Well, it dovetails with this.
[00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.214]  Kansas shoppers step over dying woman.
[00:04:09.336 --> 00:04:12.819]  She literally was bleeding to death right in the entrance to the store.
[00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:18.003]  No one even cared, and she did die.
[00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:23.668]  Now, this is mainstream news today.
[00:04:25.436 --> 00:04:26.417]  Associated Press.
[00:04:26.577 --> 00:04:31.884]  And every time I mention one of these stories from the past, without giving the exact story, people go, oh, I don't believe that.
[00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:34.767]  No, this is just part of the course.
[00:04:35.968 --> 00:04:45.940]  There have been cases where people have been beaten in the head, bleeding, naked, on a street corner, with over 500 people passing them, over three hours, and no one stops.
[00:04:47.317 --> 00:04:50.921]  I mean, you wonder how DynCorp can run giant child kidnapping rings?
[00:04:51.262 --> 00:04:56.628]  You wonder how the Vice President can say he's above the law and have his criminal aide pardoned?
[00:04:56.648 --> 00:04:57.749]  This is how.
[00:04:57.769 --> 00:04:58.370]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.696]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.057 --> 00:05:17.685]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:25.447]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.848 --> 00:05:37.276]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.576 --> 00:05:41.039]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.481]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.821 --> 00:05:47.644]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:05.858]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:05.918 --> 00:06:13.243]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:13.363 --> 00:06:24.051]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:06:24.211 --> 00:06:28.774]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:29.034 --> 00:06:34.018]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:06:34.238 --> 00:06:37.180]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:47.227]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black murky elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[00:07:02.597 --> 00:07:06.721]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:08.703]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:08.983 --> 00:07:15.269]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.549 --> 00:07:21.675]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.935 --> 00:07:23.677]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:23.977]  We're good.
[00:07:46.543 --> 00:07:49.625]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:51.307]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.092]  Okay, thank you so much for joining us again today.
[00:08:35.652 --> 00:08:40.836]  We will be going over the headline, North American Union Plan headed to Congress in the fall.
[00:08:40.856 --> 00:08:46.599]  We'll also get into what's happening to the President as well as the Congress' approval ratings.
[00:08:46.779 --> 00:08:50.762]  But I wanted to cover this first today.
[00:08:52.943 --> 00:08:58.807]  Kansas shoppers step over dying woman.
[00:08:58.827 --> 00:09:00.989]  And let me just read the article before I comment on it.
[00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.191]  Associated Press
[00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:06.291]  Wichita, Kansas.
[00:09:07.972 --> 00:09:08.692]  July 4th.
[00:09:11.013 --> 00:09:17.996]  A stabbing victim, LaShonda Calloway, lay dying on the floor of a convenience store.
[00:09:19.377 --> 00:09:27.681]  Five shoppers, including one who stopped to take a picture of her with a cell phone, stepped over the woman, police said.
[00:09:28.695 --> 00:09:42.641]  The June 23rd situation captured on the store's surveillance video got scant news coverage until a columnist for the Wichita Eagle discovered the existence of the video and its contents Tuesday.
[00:09:43.802 --> 00:09:48.303]  Police have refused to release the video, saying it is part of their investigation.
[00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:54.046]  It was tragic to watch, said police spokesman Gordon Macham,
[00:09:55.453 --> 00:10:04.679]  The fact that people were more interested in taking a picture with a cell phone and shopping for snacks rather than helping this innocent young woman is frankly revolting.
[00:10:05.079 --> 00:10:05.880]  Well, I agree with you.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.203]  The woman was stabbed during an altercation that was not part of a robbery.
[00:10:11.604 --> 00:10:17.047]  Basham said it took about two minutes for someone to call 911, he said.
[00:10:17.107 --> 00:10:19.569]  Now, that's nothing compared to what we've seen in the past.
[00:10:20.069 --> 00:10:21.530]  Calloway, 27, died later in a hospital.
[00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:24.728]  Two suspects have been arrested.
[00:10:24.768 --> 00:10:27.749]  A 19-year-old woman was charged with first-degree murder.
[00:10:27.789 --> 00:10:33.891]  Another suspect who turned himself in has not been charged as of Tuesday, said Sedgwick County Prosecutor's Office.
[00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:39.652]  The District Attorney's Office will have to decide whether any of the shoppers could be charged, Bashim said.
[00:10:41.993 --> 00:10:44.453]  It was uncertain what law of any will be applicable.
[00:10:44.794 --> 00:10:50.315]  A state or statute or failure to render aid refers only to victims of a car accident.
[00:10:53.780 --> 00:11:02.163]  And there are good Samaritan laws in most states where if you see the wreck happen and nobody else is stopping, that you're supposed to stop and render aid.
[00:11:04.824 --> 00:11:23.011]  But literally, people have got an iPhone to buy, an iPod to buy, they've got to go get collagen injections in their lips, they've got to get their hair done, they've got to have some special mask put on at the beauty salon, or they've got to go get a new tattoo, or they've got to go lift weights and inject extra steroids to look tough.
[00:11:24.089 --> 00:11:27.091]  They've got to go get a green mohawk.
[00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:30.893]  They've got to go get new jewelry.
[00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:33.495]  They've got to make more money to get a bigger house.
[00:11:35.596 --> 00:11:37.517]  They've got to get a better pair of golf clubs.
[00:11:37.537 --> 00:11:38.978]  I mean, whatever you're into.
[00:11:40.719 --> 00:11:42.721]  Whatever you're into in that whole gamut of things.
[00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:46.023]  You've got to go out and visit with a prostitute.
[00:11:46.043 --> 00:11:46.903]  You've got to go do whatever.
[00:11:47.203 --> 00:11:48.164]  You're so busy
[00:11:49.392 --> 00:11:58.740]  In your own life, getting down the road, or your children are about to get out of school, and in most schools now, if you're more than 10 minutes late to pick them up, they call CPS on your children.
[00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:02.664]  So, in some cases, you don't have a choice, I guess.
[00:12:03.584 --> 00:12:04.685]  Which god do you serve?
[00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:06.067]  The CPS or the police?
[00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.192]  There's so many examples of this, but
[00:12:13.487 --> 00:12:32.173]  I've told the story before, I don't know, six, seven years ago now, a cop at the corner of William Cannon and I-35 in Austin was hit by a car and was knocked into the median, bleeding to death, and fire ants got all over him, and memory serves, he died.
[00:12:34.634 --> 00:12:36.915]  And no one stopped for 45 minutes.
[00:12:37.155 --> 00:12:38.055]  They just drove by.
[00:12:40.156 --> 00:12:40.656]  Drove by.
[00:12:41.755 --> 00:12:48.320]  Because after all, they didn't want the trouble, they didn't want to have to... And I experienced this, and believe me, I don't deserve a medal for this.
[00:12:48.700 --> 00:12:57.767]  Everybody was so amazed that I was at a Madeleine restaurant.
[00:12:58.308 --> 00:13:03.272]  It's kind of like French cafeteria, hot plate French food.
[00:13:03.912 --> 00:13:04.893]  What a weird concept.
[00:13:05.393 --> 00:13:06.854]  And I'm in there with my wife and my son.
[00:13:06.874 --> 00:13:07.695]  He's about a year old.
[00:13:09.016 --> 00:13:11.258]  And we're about to leave.
[00:13:13.306 --> 00:13:17.670]  And I go to the bathroom, and I hear screaming and yelling and commotion.
[00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:23.014]  I come running out, and there is this woman choking, turning blue.
[00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:31.680]  And I walk up, and I'm watching all these people around her, and I watch her family with her, and everyone's yelling, Call 911!
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:31.980]  Call 911!
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:32.201]  Call 911!
[00:13:37.859 --> 00:13:45.463]  And I start saying, excuse me, I'm having to push people out of the way, and they start saying, hold on, hold on, 9-1-1!
[00:13:45.623 --> 00:13:46.144]  What are you doing?
[00:13:46.644 --> 00:13:47.725]  Oh my God, someone help her!
[00:13:47.745 --> 00:13:48.405]  9-1-1!
[00:13:48.465 --> 00:13:53.468]  I mean, they're literally like parrots going, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1, 9-1-1!
[00:13:54.649 --> 00:13:58.931]  And I'm having to shove through about 15 people because they'd congregated by the time I got out there.
[00:14:01.392 --> 00:14:04.194]  And the lady's turning blue, she's got her hands on the table.
[00:14:05.419 --> 00:14:09.503]  And I start saying, stand back, and people are crowding going, no, no, no, 9-1-1!
[00:14:09.803 --> 00:14:28.882]  And I literally had to shove some man out of the way, kind of a little bit forcefully up against the wall, because instinct was kicking in at that point, I shove him back, and I go, stand back, and I grab her into the Heimlich, and, she's a fat lady, do it once, doesn't work, do it twice, do it really hard, pick her up, big old wad of bread comes out of her.
[00:14:29.677 --> 00:14:58.147]  on to the table and I knew the way the Tattletail Society works next I'd be charged with assaulting her they were all thanking me and praising me but also having little greedy yuppie looks in their eyes like they were calculating and thinking and I just said let's get out of here and we left because so often you do help people that's why some folks don't help because I know there's also trouble involved with that but but my point is that people are have some nut crashing down their front door
[00:14:59.153 --> 00:15:00.254]  And they'll run in their back bedroom.
[00:15:00.274 --> 00:15:00.995]  They'll lock the door.
[00:15:01.055 --> 00:15:02.736]  We've all heard the 911 tapes of this.
[00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:03.196]  We can hear them.
[00:15:03.216 --> 00:15:03.837]  They're horrifying.
[00:15:03.857 --> 00:15:07.020]  Down in Seattle and Detroit and L.A.
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:10.482]  And the woman's screaming, You just busted a meter!
[00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:10.963]  Boom!
[00:15:11.003 --> 00:15:11.363]  Boom!
[00:15:11.743 --> 00:15:12.764]  I'm gonna get you!
[00:15:12.784 --> 00:15:14.306]  Oh, he's got a knife!
[00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:14.926]  Help me!
[00:15:15.286 --> 00:15:15.446]  Oh!
[00:15:15.507 --> 00:15:16.307]  And the cops get there.
[00:15:16.327 --> 00:15:17.888]  I mean, she's been dead for ten minutes.
[00:15:20.591 --> 00:15:24.054]  Or in one famous case, they thought it was fake and didn't even call the cops.
[00:15:24.534 --> 00:15:26.856]  The 911 operator was like, Oh, this isn't real.
[00:15:30.183 --> 00:15:32.344]  My point is, I'm not even knocking the police in this case.
[00:15:32.384 --> 00:15:33.885]  They can't protect you.
[00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:41.670]  The average 911 call, national time average, last time I looked, it may be different, this is a few years old, was 12 minutes.
[00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:52.117]  It was actually more than, it was 12 and a half or something, I don't remember the exact, 12 plus minutes for them to come.
[00:15:53.618 --> 00:15:58.961]  I mean, 30 seconds when somebody's coming through your door, or you find somebody in your house,
[00:15:59.688 --> 00:16:01.829]  Or you come home and there's a robber in your house.
[00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:08.452]  That's an eon, 30 seconds, much less 12 plus minutes.
[00:16:11.074 --> 00:16:15.636]  And you saw in New Orleans, they wouldn't bring you food or water, but they would come and confiscate your guns.
[00:16:17.457 --> 00:16:25.221]  With the Blackwater mercenaries and the military all backing up the FBI and police and a multi-jurisdictional task force.
[00:16:28.502 --> 00:16:29.962]  And then there's a really famous case.
[00:16:30.102 --> 00:16:31.583]  It was in Toronto, remember?
[00:16:32.103 --> 00:16:36.864]  The young woman was naked on a major thoroughfare.
[00:16:36.904 --> 00:16:37.885]  She wasn't in an alley.
[00:16:38.805 --> 00:16:41.446]  Bleeding, beating the head with a pipe.
[00:16:41.466 --> 00:16:43.526]  Last time I saw her, I never saw another article about her.
[00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:44.667]  She was in a coma.
[00:16:46.747 --> 00:16:48.828]  And there was a major telecommunications company.
[00:16:50.068 --> 00:16:54.589]  And on the third floor, the CEO was looking out, laughing at her, getting everyone in the office to look.
[00:16:54.609 --> 00:16:55.750]  Then he said, nobody call the cops.
[00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:56.890]  We don't want to have to give a report.
[00:16:58.909 --> 00:17:03.251]  But hundreds of people, for several hours on the street, walked and stepped over her.
[00:17:03.371 --> 00:17:06.112]  A naked, bleeding woman.
[00:17:10.413 --> 00:17:13.194]  Now you wonder why the government will just lie out of hand now.
[00:17:14.374 --> 00:17:25.038]  And you wonder why there will be 91% against open borders, or 99% against the North American Union, or 97% against trans-NAFTA highways, and trans-Texas corridors,
[00:17:27.030 --> 00:17:32.673]  80 plus percent against the war, and Congress with a 12 percent approval rating, Bush with a 25 now.
[00:17:34.274 --> 00:17:35.695]  Why'd they just continue on?
[00:17:36.155 --> 00:17:43.199]  Because they know deep down the vast majority of people will stand by and let CPS take their children.
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.141]  Something a wild animal won't do.
[00:17:48.152 --> 00:17:49.933]  Something humans certainly wouldn't do in the past.
[00:17:50.333 --> 00:17:52.814]  We have been trained to do it through TV and the culture.
[00:17:53.135 --> 00:17:59.218]  We've been trained to be spectators, watchers, not to take action, not to be involved, not to be awake.
[00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:08.843]  And if people are so self-centered, that's really the main driver of this, so selfish.
[00:18:09.163 --> 00:18:10.784]  You know, I told my wife about this this morning.
[00:18:10.824 --> 00:18:13.085]  She goes, I was going to tell you about it, but I didn't want to upset you.
[00:18:13.985 --> 00:18:15.306]  She said, I was at the gym.
[00:18:18.195 --> 00:18:47.755]  And they have the upstairs area with the bikes and this ambulance gets there and the fire truck and they go up there and I go up to see what's happening see if I can help once it's been a big commotion and and and they've got a guy with defibrillators on the ground he sees his heart stop there they're defibrillating she never knew the middle-aged man died or not and there were people literally on stair steppers one machine over still stair stepping
[00:18:48.351 --> 00:18:51.753]  I mean, you got somebody dead, folks, right next to you.
[00:18:52.994 --> 00:18:55.075]  We don't know if they got his engine going again.
[00:18:56.195 --> 00:18:57.656]  And my wife's freaked out about it.
[00:18:58.517 --> 00:19:01.098]  She's asking if she can help the fireman, being told no.
[00:19:01.678 --> 00:19:03.359]  The point is, at least she went up there to see.
[00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:05.340]  Not that she's some special person.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:13.245]  I mean, she is a special person, but it's not really supposed to be special to be concerned about someone dead next to you.
[00:19:13.265 --> 00:19:14.505]  I mean, that's normal.
[00:19:16.366 --> 00:19:17.687]  That's normal behavior.
[00:19:18.357 --> 00:19:19.017]  Nothing special.
[00:19:19.318 --> 00:19:21.198]  Nothing special about doing a Heimlich Maneuver.
[00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:28.802]  It was that whole restaurant, and I mean literally, it was like 7 o'clock at night, weeknight, jam-packed, you know, hardly any seats.
[00:19:29.182 --> 00:19:29.723]  Full of people.
[00:19:30.863 --> 00:19:36.546]  I had to literally shove people out of the way to save that woman.
[00:19:38.247 --> 00:19:40.568]  As they literally, like parrots, said, 9-1-1, 9-1-1.
[00:19:40.908 --> 00:19:45.090]  Now by the way, I don't even have official
[00:19:46.551 --> 00:19:47.031]  C.P.R.
[00:19:47.051 --> 00:19:47.331]  training.
[00:19:47.371 --> 00:19:53.714]  I mean, we had like a half-day course in swim team and a half-day course in civil air patrol.
[00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:57.176]  But, uh, point is I took action.
[00:19:57.676 --> 00:19:58.156]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:00.914 --> 00:20:03.936]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:04.256 --> 00:20:09.158]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:09.419 --> 00:20:13.781]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.061 --> 00:20:22.986]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.186 --> 00:20:26.808]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.108 --> 00:20:32.133]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:32.434 --> 00:20:39.121]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:39.648 --> 00:20:40.289]  What about you?
[00:20:40.929 --> 00:20:46.294]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:21:00.899 --> 00:21:04.801]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.021 --> 00:21:17.286]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:17.706 --> 00:21:18.106]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.166 --> 00:21:23.748]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.148 --> 00:21:26.349]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:29.272]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:21:29.312 --> 00:21:32.155]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:38.322]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:21:38.722 --> 00:21:42.086]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:21:42.166 --> 00:21:48.514]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:21:49.054 --> 00:21:53.079]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.179 --> 00:21:53.379]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:53.599]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.673 --> 00:22:03.734]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.354 --> 00:22:13.276]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.736 --> 00:22:20.918]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:27.153]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:00.891 --> 00:23:02.672]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:23:02.752 --> 00:23:04.012]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:04.233 --> 00:23:07.074]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:07.434 --> 00:23:10.155]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:10.738 --> 00:23:17.482]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:24:08.996 --> 00:24:15.381]  Alright, right here is the news article about Wichita, Kansas for the stabbing
[00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:40.046]  And nobody even stopping to render aid, stepping over the lady, taking photos.
[00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:41.527]  Oh look, a woman bleeding to death.
[00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:42.808]  She did die.
[00:24:42.828 --> 00:24:44.569]  Oh, and big pools of blood.
[00:24:44.629 --> 00:24:45.109]  Click, click.
[00:24:45.129 --> 00:24:45.809]  How interesting.
[00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:47.490]  Again, it was like television.
[00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:48.331]  It was entertainment.
[00:24:49.051 --> 00:24:51.213]  This is just appalling, Williams told the newspaper.
[00:24:51.233 --> 00:24:52.333]  That's the police chief.
[00:24:53.914 --> 00:24:57.756]  I could continue shopping and not render aid and then take time out to take a picture?
[00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:58.477]  That's crazy.
[00:24:58.877 --> 00:25:00.418]  What's happening to respect for life?
[00:25:01.098 --> 00:25:27.448]  Well, every major scientific study that's been conducted on the subject has conclusively shown that television was developed in the thirties, implemented wide-scale in the fifties, and that you see a violent rise in crime and violent crime as people watch television and as their viewing habits increase and as more television is watched and as television gets more violent.
[00:25:29.992 --> 00:25:31.093]  I mean, you're not mint.
[00:25:31.173 --> 00:25:42.439]  That's why people 100 years ago, the first time they run a sword through somebody or shot somebody up close with a musket, 300 years ago, 200 years ago, 150 years ago, you would throw up.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:49.243]  And it took, for soldiers, even Roman centurions, this was written about in history books, 2,000 years ago.
[00:25:49.763 --> 00:25:54.146]  When you first join and become part of a group,
[00:25:54.864 --> 00:26:10.318]  And we're under a centurion and you go out and your first few battles people would get nauseated chopping arms and legs off and seeing piles of dead bodies and seeing guts because your brain associates that with yourself or with your family.
[00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:21.234]  I mean, an analogy is looking through a pile of old pictures of family, you know, from 10, 20, 30 years ago, and most of them are dead.
[00:26:21.254 --> 00:26:22.795]  That'll make you depressed.
[00:26:22.815 --> 00:26:23.836]  That'll kind of make you sad.
[00:26:23.856 --> 00:26:27.478]  We were all happy last night having dinner over with my parents, and I said, hey, get out some pictures.
[00:26:27.498 --> 00:26:28.439]  Let's look at some old pictures.
[00:26:28.479 --> 00:26:32.501]  And by the end of it, we were all kind of sad, looking at all these people that were dead and gone.
[00:26:34.322 --> 00:26:35.423]  But I digress.
[00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:40.146]  That's why the brain does that, because it associates it with, well, I won't be here forever.
[00:26:40.206 --> 00:26:41.487]  My children won't be here forever.
[00:26:42.734 --> 00:26:44.675]  Everything we're doing is just transitory.
[00:26:45.196 --> 00:26:47.056]  We're not here forever.
[00:26:49.378 --> 00:26:56.061]  Well, when you kill somebody, or you hurt somebody, you're supposed to feel guilt about it, even if you were defending yourself.
[00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.181]  Not anymore, folks.
[00:26:57.221 --> 00:26:59.462]  They've got soldiers that will kill people all day and all night.
[00:27:00.303 --> 00:27:01.603]  But they're not human anymore.
[00:27:02.864 --> 00:27:07.626]  They've literally been turned into flesh and blood biological androids.
[00:27:08.287 --> 00:27:11.148]  Facsimiles of what human beings used to be and are.
[00:27:11.846 --> 00:27:13.567]  The basic programming overwritten.
[00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:32.121]  I mean, when people can just wander around a store and step over a person bleeding to death, or a cop bleeding to death in Austin, or a young lady bleeding to death on the side of the street, and when people stand around yelling 9-1-1, 9-1-1, I mean, it starts with that too.
[00:27:32.362 --> 00:27:34.283]  It's not their responsibility.
[00:27:34.723 --> 00:27:38.847]  Why, there's experts, there's trained professionals that are meant to do that.
[00:27:40.027 --> 00:27:40.488]  Just like
[00:27:41.613 --> 00:28:02.258]  Columbine or Virginia Tech or a half dozen other shootings where the police for hours sit around putting on worthless gear meant to protect themselves hiding behind trees 500 yards from the shooter literally you could see their faces shaking in fear
[00:28:03.562 --> 00:28:09.904]  I mean, frankly, men of the past, you couldn't hold them back from an opportunity to charge in and go after somebody.
[00:28:10.224 --> 00:28:17.646]  Now, men of the past would have gone in and killed him fast, would have done it with proficiency and had courage, but they'd have been sick after they did it.
[00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:25.567]  See, now, those men out there shaking in fear, they wouldn't have gotten sick after killing.
[00:28:27.388 --> 00:28:29.789]  But they were too cowardly to go in and do it, so it's a paradox.
[00:28:32.583 --> 00:28:35.064]  Take Ray Martinez, now a Texas Ranger, retired.
[00:28:35.924 --> 00:28:47.148]  One of the men who went up with the janitor and one other police officer went up and took out the tower shooter, Charles Whitman, the Marine.
[00:28:48.488 --> 00:28:53.890]  When he was done, when he came down, he basically collapsed and then threw up.
[00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.751]  Because even though he just killed a shooter,
[00:28:58.122 --> 00:29:00.724]  Basic programming said this is really bad.
[00:29:01.084 --> 00:29:04.485]  Even though you did it in defense, you've done a good thing, this is a big deal.
[00:29:05.126 --> 00:29:07.507]  When you kill somebody, it's a big deal.
[00:29:08.187 --> 00:29:11.189]  Because we're designed to be in small tribal troop groups.
[00:29:12.429 --> 00:29:19.593]  And to kill somebody next to us, we've got basic programming in us that is to hold us back from doing that.
[00:29:22.675 --> 00:29:23.255]  Now cops,
[00:29:23.977 --> 00:29:26.138]  I've seen an Austin video I've seen after shootings.
[00:29:26.478 --> 00:29:27.678]  They do high-fives, folks.
[00:29:29.679 --> 00:29:35.021]  Cops in Houston, they'll go to the house of a schizophrenic woman, blow her in half, then laugh about her blood all over the wall.
[00:29:36.281 --> 00:29:39.302]  See, something fundamental has changed.
[00:29:40.283 --> 00:29:42.843]  We've turned into beasts.
[00:29:51.622 --> 00:29:54.631]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.553 --> 00:29:58.240]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.363 --> 00:30:04.084]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:30:04.524 --> 00:30:06.825]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[00:30:07.125 --> 00:30:10.206]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:30:10.686 --> 00:30:12.826]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:30:13.006 --> 00:30:14.387]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[00:30:14.647 --> 00:30:18.768]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[00:30:19.108 --> 00:30:22.209]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:23.750]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:33.259]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.

[00:31:01.093 --> 00:31:08.095]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:31:09.295 --> 00:31:13.336]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:31:14.085 --> 00:31:21.130]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:30.776]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[00:32:02.006 --> 00:32:02.626]  Morning, neighbor!
[00:32:02.646 --> 00:32:04.688]  Hey, shouldn't you be at work?
[00:32:05.108 --> 00:32:05.428]  I am.
[00:32:05.688 --> 00:32:07.669]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:08.530]  What do you mean?
[00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:11.612]  Well, I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[00:32:11.892 --> 00:32:14.013]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[00:32:14.153 --> 00:32:15.314]  But I never have to go to work.
[00:32:15.594 --> 00:32:16.555]  So, what do you do?
[00:32:16.835 --> 00:32:17.935]  Not very much at all now.
[00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:20.017]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[00:32:20.037 --> 00:32:20.937]  It's got a funny name.
[00:32:20.997 --> 00:32:23.719]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:24.059 --> 00:32:24.999]  That is funny.
[00:32:25.019 --> 00:32:29.920]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[00:32:30.421 --> 00:32:32.541]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[00:32:32.701 --> 00:32:35.422]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[00:32:35.622 --> 00:32:36.302]  You should log on.
[00:32:36.442 --> 00:32:38.323]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[00:32:38.503 --> 00:32:39.943]  So, what was that website?
[00:32:40.043 --> 00:32:45.444]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait.
[00:32:45.484 --> 00:32:47.185]  I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[00:32:47.385 --> 00:32:48.445]  You don't need to write it down.
[00:32:48.485 --> 00:32:49.365]  It's easy to remember.
[00:32:49.605 --> 00:32:51.866]  DidYouRobBillGates.com
[00:32:52.566 --> 00:32:52.946]  Yeah!
[00:32:53.306 --> 00:32:56.947]  DidYouRobBillGates.com That is easy!
[00:32:57.288 --> 00:32:59.928]  It's easy, and the money is awesome!
[00:33:01.329 --> 00:33:08.571]  There have always been criminals, there's always been crime syndicates, we've had central banks.
[00:33:21.503 --> 00:33:28.488]  In predominant control of this country for over a hundred years, but why are they making their move now against our society?
[00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.952]  Because they know we're all broken up, we don't have real communities.
[00:33:33.792 --> 00:33:40.778]  Family, the average person, warehouses, the elderly, so they can die in bed sores, nobody wants to hear that.
[00:33:41.338 --> 00:33:46.202]  We don't want to have a baby, we just have an abortion, it's standard birth control now.
[00:33:47.302 --> 00:33:55.589]  And so of course you're going to have a woman with blood all over the ground, bleeding to death in a grocery store with people walking by her and taking pictures like she's something on television.
[00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:59.332]  Oh look, there's a woman in a pool of blood, bleeding to death.
[00:33:59.372 --> 00:34:00.473]  Here, let's take a picture.
[00:34:00.974 --> 00:34:02.315]  Oh, somebody's choking to death.
[00:34:02.715 --> 00:34:09.581]  Let's call 9-1-1 and if the ambulance drives 100 miles an hour, they'll be here in 10 minutes when she's dead.
[00:34:12.575 --> 00:34:18.597]  Oh, look, there's a cop hit by a car going 45 miles an hour, bleeding to death in a pile of fire ants.
[00:34:19.837 --> 00:34:20.978]  Oh, let's just ignore it.
[00:34:21.058 --> 00:34:22.098]  Oh, there's an old man.
[00:34:22.718 --> 00:34:26.320]  Let's just watch those street kids stab him 15 times in Detroit.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:30.401]  And then when he collapses, we don't want to have to be involved with a police report.
[00:34:30.421 --> 00:34:34.962]  Let's just let him die there on the sidewalk with hundreds of people seeing it happen.
[00:34:36.183 --> 00:34:39.564]  I mean, I see these reports every couple days and I'm not looking for them.
[00:34:43.774 --> 00:34:48.165]  Now, instinctively, when you see an old man being attacked as a male,
[00:34:50.558 --> 00:34:58.960]  You would have the normal inbred instinct of need if you saw a woman or a child or the elderly being attacked.
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:06.081]  It was a normal male instinct to swing into action and to physically attack, physically assault.
[00:35:06.822 --> 00:35:08.062]  You're not even meant to think about it.
[00:35:08.082 --> 00:35:10.842]  You're meant to charge in and attack the person doing that.
[00:35:11.222 --> 00:35:13.483]  That has now been bred and trained out of us.
[00:35:15.347 --> 00:35:27.698]  And I'm telling you, these six foot four guys with devil tats all over them, with the smoking tin girlfriend in the monster truck, they'll stand by while an old man's getting beat up on average.
[00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:29.860]  We've seen the cases.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:42.431]  Because again, it's about the illusion of being tough, the illusion of being the cool guy, but really, cool is having a ski boat and acting tough and bulging your eyes out at people at bars.
[00:35:44.238 --> 00:35:49.423]  Tough isn't being involved in your community, standing up for your country, defending your republic.
[00:35:50.063 --> 00:36:00.993]  And part of this weakness, this psychological malaise, this squalor, is that people buy into real simple, hokey propaganda, too.
[00:36:01.114 --> 00:36:04.497]  I mean, these weak-minded people all feel real good about themselves.
[00:36:06.679 --> 00:36:07.740]  They're big patriots.
[00:36:11.553 --> 00:36:15.595]  And I'm not knocking somebody if you're six foot four with tattoos and drive a monster truck.
[00:36:15.615 --> 00:36:17.115]  You know the types I'm talking about though.
[00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:21.377]  Where it's all this big male persona.
[00:36:21.777 --> 00:36:31.742]  But I've literally seen those guys many times when the cops pull them over, or cops are questioning them, or they're getting a ticket, literally look like they're urinating in their pants.
[00:36:34.223 --> 00:36:35.623]  Because they're afraid, folks.
[00:36:36.204 --> 00:36:39.345]  They put on that big act because they're afraid.
[00:36:43.582 --> 00:36:46.403]  See, the converse is, I'm afraid of what I will do.
[00:36:49.245 --> 00:36:54.827]  The opposite of that is, I'm afraid of being an aggressive, vicious person.
[00:36:55.568 --> 00:36:56.268]  See, that's the difference.
[00:36:56.548 --> 00:36:58.669]  That's what people were in the past.
[00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:03.792]  That's why we had morals, was to restrain ourselves.
[00:37:05.879 --> 00:37:08.300]  Because people were back to basics.
[00:37:08.341 --> 00:37:09.641]  People were in the basics.
[00:37:09.701 --> 00:37:14.444]  People were a lot more honest to themselves about what we are as a species.
[00:37:14.984 --> 00:37:15.605]  Not today.
[00:37:18.547 --> 00:37:29.693]  Today, we are a pack of decadent, self-centered, wicked, band chiefs.
[00:37:31.634 --> 00:37:32.815]  And we think it's tough.
[00:37:34.648 --> 00:37:36.209]  People think evil is tough.
[00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.512]  They think symbols and signals of death are tough.
[00:37:39.933 --> 00:37:41.134]  No, it's weak.
[00:37:42.174 --> 00:37:43.095]  Death comes easy.
[00:37:43.496 --> 00:37:44.316]  Life is hard.
[00:37:46.678 --> 00:37:52.083]  They love the allure of darkness, because deep down, they're so afraid of it.
[00:37:52.343 --> 00:37:55.205]  They think if they embrace it, it will give them power over it.
[00:37:55.546 --> 00:37:57.768]  And no, it will not give you power over it.
[00:37:58.208 --> 00:38:00.170]  It will lead to your destruction.
[00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:02.792]  Look at our tough boy society.
[00:38:03.661 --> 00:38:07.062]  The families are now at over 50% illegitimate.
[00:38:09.403 --> 00:38:11.424]  The society is completely unraveling.
[00:38:11.844 --> 00:38:14.466]  The young people can hardly speak in full sentences.
[00:38:18.207 --> 00:38:20.788]  Women are completely base and animalistic.
[00:38:21.208 --> 00:38:23.409]  Men are completely base and animalistic.
[00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:29.812]  And like all other truly animalistic societies, very, very cowardly on top of it.
[00:38:30.549 --> 00:38:34.270]  Kind of like rats scurrying instead of lions charging.
[00:38:36.391 --> 00:38:38.372]  They have all the trappings of the tough guy.
[00:38:39.432 --> 00:38:43.013]  All the signets and all the logos, but they have none of it in their hearts.
[00:38:50.816 --> 00:38:52.957]  And so we have these case examples.
[00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:11.754]  Where a child can be mugged and beaten in the street and grabbed and drugged away in a car to their death and neighbors stand there and watch it dialing 911 of course.
[00:39:12.734 --> 00:39:22.378]  I mean if I see some people out in the street kidnapping a child I'm not going to even go to my instant access pistol safe and get a gun.
[00:39:22.398 --> 00:39:25.018]  I'm going to run out and I'm going to rip their head off.
[00:39:25.939 --> 00:39:29.280]  I'm going to totally and completely assault them.
[00:39:30.345 --> 00:39:36.170]  And it's not because I'm a tough guy, it's because all I gotta do is flick on what my brain is designed to do.
[00:39:42.755 --> 00:39:45.077]  You see, you have that aggression for a reason.
[00:39:45.377 --> 00:39:46.618]  It's to fight evil.
[00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.641]  It is to protect your people.
[00:39:51.388 --> 00:40:00.035]  But again, the New World Order takes everything we are and counterfeits it and twists it and turns it into something completely different.
[00:40:00.355 --> 00:40:20.130]  To the point of anywhere you go from Dallas, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri to upstate New York to New Jersey, we have new footage in New Jersey, where you're at a campus at a Ron Paul rally
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:32.609]  And the police walk over and tell the Ron Paul rally they can't be there and that they can't be standing there with their signs and they tell 9-11 truthers that they're not allowed to without a permit.
[00:40:38.493 --> 00:40:43.717]  And the police of course come because they've gotten a complaint about people demonstrating.
[00:40:43.737 --> 00:40:48.381]  I've got another video of a Ron Paul
[00:40:52.853 --> 00:41:18.293]  demonstration where the police are pulling the exact same thing and still another video of some Ron Paul supporters at a baseball game and they all hold up their little paper signs each one I'd say about
[00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:41.264]  10 inches by 8 inches that spell out Ron Paul a Ron Paul meetup group and people start tattling on them in the aisle around them saying they're not allowed to have that and they run off and get some meathead security guy to come over and start threatening them and taking away their sign.
[00:41:43.066 --> 00:41:47.829]  My point is you got people if they see a mark on the child
[00:41:49.224 --> 00:41:53.125]  of the next door neighbor will call CPS on them and ruin their lives.
[00:41:54.085 --> 00:41:58.406]  You got people who will channel on their neighbor if they think they're not paying their taxes.
[00:41:58.946 --> 00:42:03.507]  You got people that will call the police on a demonstration and say we think it's illegal.
[00:42:05.227 --> 00:42:13.429]  You got people that will do that, but when it comes to somebody bleeding to death on the ground in front of them, they're not going to get involved.
[00:42:17.105 --> 00:42:22.029]  Because societally and socially, they've been encouraged to be a petty tattletale.
[00:42:22.509 --> 00:42:35.320]  They have not been encouraged to take action, because we've gone from being the most upright, most independent, most aggressive people in the world, to now being the most passive.
[00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:39.143]  And there are scientific reports and major federal numbers on that.
[00:42:42.225 --> 00:42:43.887]  Most unlikely to render aid.
[00:42:45.379 --> 00:42:54.723]  You can say what you want about the Arabs all day over the Middle East but those people will help you if you're in trouble and they'll give you a place to stay because they know the value of that.
[00:42:55.003 --> 00:42:58.324]  They know what's going to happen to them when they need help or when they need support.
[00:42:58.745 --> 00:42:59.925]  They understand community.
[00:43:00.605 --> 00:43:08.889]  Something we understood here once as well before they destroyed our families, before they destroyed our cultures, before they turned us into
[00:43:10.027 --> 00:43:29.237]  Mindless fools who have nothing but trinkets and baubles that we go around showing off to each other in some endless game of rank attainment, like bird brains do, like cockatoos do in the wild of Australia, seeing who can get on the highest perch.
[00:43:32.579 --> 00:43:35.320]  That's all that matters, who can be on the highest perch.
[00:43:44.477 --> 00:43:54.519]  So I know I've burned up a lot of time today so far on this subject, but it's a big deal.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:09.543]  Do any of you out there think that you're going to be safe in a society where if you're bleeding to death in a grocery store no one's going to help you and they're going to stop and take pictures of you because they're so psychopathic?
[00:44:09.863 --> 00:44:11.243]  And that's what it is to be psychopathic.
[00:44:12.894 --> 00:44:15.595]  Is you completely care about no one but yourself.
[00:44:15.715 --> 00:44:20.696]  You literally don't care if something bad is happening to someone.
[00:44:21.096 --> 00:44:26.737]  A person is like a ham sandwich to you, there to simply be devoured by you if you feel like it.
[00:44:29.878 --> 00:44:40.280]  Some would argue that that is sociopathic, but no, when it's somebody in a pool of blood, or someone in a pool of blood on a sidewalk, or an old man being stabbed,
[00:44:41.728 --> 00:44:51.330]  And you don't get involved because baseline, you really don't care about them, and to you it's kind of interesting to watch it out of your kitchen window.
[00:44:53.931 --> 00:44:54.791]  You're a psychopath.
[00:44:55.331 --> 00:45:00.252]  And we are becoming a nation of sociopaths led by psychopaths.
[00:45:02.352 --> 00:45:10.574]  From land of the free, home of the brave, to a land of the sociopath, commanded and captained by psychopaths.
[00:45:11.283 --> 00:45:23.827]  who are now using television scientifically to give us their taste, to bathe us, to baptize us in evil, to bring us over to their way of thinking and their way of operating.
[00:45:26.848 --> 00:45:40.693]  To a point, to a point as a society
[00:45:42.119 --> 00:45:43.440]  We're all alone.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:46.281]  Easily picked off one by one.
[00:45:46.301 --> 00:45:48.282]  No one to give us strength.
[00:45:48.382 --> 00:45:49.022]  No community.
[00:45:49.062 --> 00:45:50.183]  No one to stand by us.
[00:45:51.183 --> 00:45:52.764]  Because we didn't look out for anybody.
[00:45:53.324 --> 00:45:55.845]  We weren't willing to lay down our lives for our brothers.
[00:45:55.865 --> 00:45:57.226]  Then what's going to happen to us?
[00:45:58.026 --> 00:45:59.807]  What type of world are we going to live in?
[00:46:00.248 --> 00:46:02.088]  When we lose that community of purpose.
[00:46:02.529 --> 00:46:08.011]  When we lose, and of course the government and the media have created false communities of purpose.
[00:46:08.451 --> 00:46:09.672]  I was at the gym yesterday.
[00:46:11.744 --> 00:46:33.491]  And I looked at all these upright, very proud people working out as hard as they could, not even for health, but most of them intensely for mating purposes, which I can understand, to look good and look physically impressive to others as part of their image of themselves.
[00:46:33.691 --> 00:46:35.291]  And I'm not knocking that.
[00:46:36.011 --> 00:46:36.892]  You need to be balanced.
[00:46:36.912 --> 00:46:38.052]  You need to try to be healthy.
[00:46:38.372 --> 00:46:41.513]  Or you go the opposite direction when you stop caring.
[00:46:42.617 --> 00:46:45.339]  And the body is a temple, and it does make your brain work better.
[00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:46.079]  I'm not knocking that.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:54.686]  But I would look at these handsome men, these beautiful women, and the particularly beautiful women looked the most unhappy.
[00:46:55.926 --> 00:46:59.989]  Because they were competing in their heads against some supermodel on television.
[00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:02.031]  And they just looked sad.
[00:47:02.091 --> 00:47:03.352]  I could look into their eyes.
[00:47:03.952 --> 00:47:05.053]  I could observe them.
[00:47:05.951 --> 00:47:15.214]  Meanwhile, there was this background of five TV screens with CNN, FOX, ESPN, and something else on.
[00:47:15.234 --> 00:47:24.837]  And four of the channels continually had videograms from the troops and the dramatic chopper rescue.
[00:47:24.917 --> 00:47:30.719]  And, man, on the 4th of July, aren't we proud of our troops in the red, white, and blue in America?
[00:47:32.006 --> 00:47:51.613]  And what it was, was the New World Order that's taken over our government, taken over our media, taken over our military, using them, destroying our good name worldwide, making us the bad guys, destroying our honor, destroying our name, our house name, the United States of America.
[00:47:51.633 --> 00:47:55.195]  That's what a nation is, it's a house.
[00:47:56.435 --> 00:47:58.816]  That's internationally how we're designated.
[00:47:59.782 --> 00:48:13.166]  And while we carry out the dirty work of the European global elite, predominantly European, there's many others, the richest man in the world now is a Mexican, of course, that's triple the resources we've got, a slave population, what do you expect?
[00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:15.566]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:48:19.447 --> 00:48:21.268]  But I've looked at people beside me.
[00:48:22.023 --> 00:48:31.030]  And I looked at this 55-year-old conservative, you know, executive type on an exercise bike, and he was reading the closed caption, just looking at CNN, feeling patriotic.
[00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:33.853]  You could just see him just loving to see our troops.
[00:48:34.313 --> 00:48:40.718]  You have a press conference, and you could see him just all the man, you know, he was feeling good about America.
[00:48:40.738 --> 00:48:46.463]  And I thought, that's why the propaganda is so effective, is that it speaks to
[00:48:48.141 --> 00:48:56.771]  Those who aren't completely into status and baubles and trinkets, they've even got false facsimiles for those people!
[00:48:58.593 --> 00:49:07.363]  Taking the name of the United States, taking the history of the United States, and a lot of great things this country's done and an incredible history,
[00:49:08.843 --> 00:49:30.047]  But the media has done its best to destroy, but then conversely they will use it in, oh America, patriotism, 4th of July, to bolster a war that is associated with the 4th of July in 1776, the unanimous declaration of independence.
[00:49:32.143 --> 00:49:33.784]  But not in the way most people would think.
[00:49:33.884 --> 00:49:35.165]  Not in the way of the colonies.
[00:49:35.645 --> 00:49:49.233]  The thirteen colonies and the brave defense of at least six to one against the most technologically advanced military in history.
[00:49:52.575 --> 00:49:53.076]  The British.
[00:49:54.616 --> 00:49:57.958]  No, the war we're running over there is decidedly British.
[00:49:58.559 --> 00:50:00.400]  Anglo-American alliance.
[00:50:01.158 --> 00:50:02.379]  New World Order.
[00:50:04.239 --> 00:50:22.746]  And it's over there to extract the oil, and to build permanent bases, and project power into the surrounding areas, to destabilize it, to continue to have brushfire rebellions for the next hundred years for military weapons contractors to have a place to have their hardware used up and destroyed.
[00:50:25.427 --> 00:50:26.848]  A market of death.
[00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.949]  And then, uh,
[00:50:30.123 --> 00:50:30.563]  What was it?
[00:50:30.623 --> 00:50:31.824]  Monday night I was up here at the office.
[00:50:31.844 --> 00:50:33.044]  We had Fox on.
[00:50:34.205 --> 00:50:37.046]  And they had this British pundit on.
[00:50:37.066 --> 00:50:45.891]  He was going, the Anglo-American establishment working together, the Anglophiles dominating, moving forward against this terror threat.
[00:50:47.952 --> 00:50:49.973]  A new order has been born.
[00:50:51.454 --> 00:50:52.854]  Nothing new about the order at all.
[00:50:54.495 --> 00:50:57.877]  And so, we look at this,
[00:51:04.628 --> 00:51:10.112]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.472 --> 00:51:18.097]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.809 --> 00:51:25.873]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.273 --> 00:51:37.699]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.999 --> 00:51:41.641]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.961 --> 00:51:43.902]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.222 --> 00:51:48.064]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.705]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:08.045 --> 00:52:12.149]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.990]  We listened.
[00:52:13.290 --> 00:52:18.276]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.556 --> 00:52:19.036]  We listened.
[00:52:19.417 --> 00:52:22.460]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:23.401]  We listened.
[00:52:23.861 --> 00:52:27.923]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:28.303 --> 00:52:28.803]  We listened.
[00:52:29.143 --> 00:52:34.386]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.786 --> 00:52:36.147]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:36.507 --> 00:52:38.087]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:38.287 --> 00:52:43.830]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:02.273]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:02.493 --> 00:53:06.175]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:06.515 --> 00:53:08.736]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:09.236 --> 00:53:15.459]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:20.522]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:20.722 --> 00:53:29.666]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:47.731 --> 00:54:50.192]  Democracy doesn't rule the world.
[00:54:50.493 --> 00:54:52.974]  You better get that through your head.
[00:54:52.994 --> 00:54:54.855]  Democracy don't rule the world.
[00:54:55.135 --> 00:54:58.837]  You better get that through your head.
[00:54:59.258 --> 00:55:01.919]  This world is ruled by violence.
[00:55:02.019 --> 00:55:06.742]  But I just have to tell you something.
[00:55:22.413 --> 00:55:23.154]  Welcome back.
[00:55:25.395 --> 00:55:26.996]  You know, it's really simple.
[00:55:30.178 --> 00:55:45.448]  I was watching videotapes last night of Khalid Mohammed, the black Pan-Africanist who died in 2001, and I would say under very suspicious circumstances.
[00:55:45.468 --> 00:55:49.931]  I love that stroke drug they give people.
[00:55:52.622 --> 00:55:54.363]  He's been shot before in a setup.
[00:55:59.127 --> 00:56:05.352]  And I wanted to play about five or six different clips of him today, but Ron Paul's flight got delayed.
[00:56:05.372 --> 00:56:06.734]  He's going to be on next week.
[00:56:08.015 --> 00:56:09.136]  Better late than never.
[00:56:09.716 --> 00:56:16.301]  Jesse Benton, our PR guy, I'm going to have him pop in for literally five minutes just to give you an update on what's happening next hour.
[00:56:17.688 --> 00:56:23.231]  I rescheduled them back a few days ago with all the terror news, the Riddle and Stones crew, very important information.
[00:56:23.792 --> 00:56:27.354]  The secret architecture of Washington DC, that's coming up in the second half of the show today.
[00:56:30.495 --> 00:56:40.181]  But, uh, I was watching this Muhammad fellow, and so much of what he said was true.
[00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:49.213]  But a lot of what he had to say was twisted and wasn't the truth.
[00:56:52.615 --> 00:56:55.377]  And I could just see tribalism really enshrined there.
[00:56:56.278 --> 00:56:57.259]  We've got the clip.
[00:56:57.459 --> 00:56:58.900]  You kill the white women.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.521]  You kill the white babies.
[00:57:01.082 --> 00:57:02.703]  Why do you kill the white woman?
[00:57:02.743 --> 00:57:07.386]  Because the white woman is the military manufacturing center.
[00:57:08.687 --> 00:57:10.849]  Well, I mean, actually, that's one of the famous quotes.
[00:57:10.909 --> 00:57:11.829]  We have the audio of it.
[00:57:11.849 --> 00:57:13.791]  We have to clip out all the GDs out of it.
[00:57:14.468 --> 00:57:15.129]  There's so many.
[00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:19.392]  But I understand Khalid Mohammed's anger.
[00:57:21.193 --> 00:57:21.473]  I do.
[00:57:23.955 --> 00:57:36.165]  But I also know that there's a reason that his people haven't truly become free, like the rest of the people haven't, is because of tribalism and going at this from a tribal view.
[00:57:40.655 --> 00:57:43.718]  You can say, well, look at the British, look at the Jews, look at others.
[00:57:43.738 --> 00:57:45.019]  They've been successful tribally.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.321]  Well, not exactly.
[00:57:47.461 --> 00:57:52.006]  Small crews over those peoples have been successful.
[00:57:52.046 --> 00:58:01.414]  It hasn't been good for the average Britner to die in all these wars and have all these taxes sucked off of him.
[00:58:03.076 --> 00:58:05.198]  To be the horse bridle pulling the wagon.
[00:58:06.271 --> 00:58:13.456]  And that's what black Muslims, I guess the sect that is hyper-racist needs to know.
[00:58:15.177 --> 00:58:17.678]  And that's what white supremacists and the rest of them need to know.
[00:58:18.639 --> 00:58:21.781]  Because by the way, white supremacists love Khalid Mohammed.
[00:58:23.242 --> 00:58:23.782]  They love it.
[00:58:23.922 --> 00:58:27.044]  They want separation and they want different nation areas.
[00:58:27.544 --> 00:58:28.645]  Well, that isn't going to happen.
[00:58:30.746 --> 00:58:32.106]  I've already opened a can of worms.
[00:58:32.827 --> 00:58:34.267]  I'm going to get to some of this later.
[00:58:34.747 --> 00:58:37.368]  We've got this big North American Union news and it is big.
[00:58:37.388 --> 00:58:37.888]  Stay with us.
[00:58:41.088 --> 00:58:45.930]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:46.070]  Hello!
[00:58:57.421 --> 00:58:58.081]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.742 --> 00:58:59.782]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.503 --> 00:59:01.623]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.284 --> 00:59:03.084]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.845 --> 00:59:04.745]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.405 --> 00:59:09.248]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.608 --> 00:59:13.670]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:26.616 --> 00:59:30.724]  Alright folks, we are now into hour number two.
[00:59:40.587 --> 00:59:51.572]  And I want to remind everybody that there was an article written about a month ago, and since then they are moving forward with this, so we need to re-raise the alarm bells here.
[00:59:52.053 --> 00:59:56.235]  North American Union plan headed to Congress in the fall.
[00:59:56.895 --> 01:00:03.778]  Powerful think tank prepares report on benefits of integration between US, Mexico, and Canada.
[01:00:04.359 --> 01:00:07.220]  A powerful think tank chaired by former Senator Sam Nunn.
[01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:21.629]  Guided by trustees including Richard Armitage, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Harold Brown, William Cohen, and Henry Kissinger, is in the final stage of preparing a report for the White House and U.S.
[01:00:21.689 --> 01:00:29.575]  Congress on the benefits of integrating the U.S., Mexico, and Canada into one political, security, and economic bloc.
[01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:41.897]  The final report published in English, Spanish, and French is scheduled for submission to all three governments September 30th according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
[01:00:42.577 --> 01:00:53.682]  Now the last report that the CFR brought forward for North American integration towards the North American Union was implemented wholesale in the Security and Prosperity Partnership Plan.
[01:00:54.342 --> 01:00:56.523]  This is the CSIS Boost A
[01:00:57.914 --> 01:01:10.496]  Uh... boasts of playing a large role in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement Ninety-Four, a treaty that set in motion a political movement many believe resembles the early stages of the European Community on its way to becoming a European Union.
[01:01:11.217 --> 01:01:22.819]  The results of the study will enable policy makers to make sound strategic long-range policy decisions about North America with an emphasis on regional integration, explains Armand B.
[01:01:24.278 --> 01:01:29.099]  Schwardt Vistrup, Director of CSIS Mexico Project.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:41.763]  Specifically, the project will focus on a detailed examination of future scenarios which are based on current trends and involve six areas of critical importance to the trilateral relationship.
[01:01:42.303 --> 01:01:48.705]  Labor, mobility, energy, the environment, security, competitiveness, and the border infrastructure, and logistics.
[01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:52.366]  Basically, the entire infrastructure.
[01:01:54.949 --> 01:02:02.995]  In the last plan, North American Future 2025 project has already been implemented basically in total.
[01:02:07.878 --> 01:02:11.821]  Absolutely amazing that this is going on.
[01:02:13.982 --> 01:02:20.107]  The good news is that the people are no longer buying it in any way.
[01:02:21.508 --> 01:02:24.510]  Ratings for Bush continue to sink lower
[01:02:27.092 --> 01:02:30.914]  And now the approval rating for Congress is at 10%.
[01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.255]  Bush is at 25%.
[01:02:35.016 --> 01:02:39.959]  And that's in a poll that showed him at 28% just a few weeks ago.
[01:02:40.759 --> 01:02:43.361]  And I've got several different articles here and a bunch of different polls.
[01:02:43.901 --> 01:02:46.122]  But basically Congress has between a 10 and a 14.
[01:02:46.162 --> 01:02:48.203]  And Bush has between a 25 and a 29.
[01:02:48.243 --> 01:02:49.244]  And Dick Cheney has between a 9 and a 12.
[01:02:49.424 --> 01:02:50.084]  Any way you slice it,
[01:02:57.122 --> 01:03:00.223]  The New World Order does not have the support of the American people.
[01:03:01.563 --> 01:03:06.344]  The people are awake to the fact that they've been conned and lied to.
[01:03:06.964 --> 01:03:09.464]  They do not know the specifics, most of them.
[01:03:10.004 --> 01:03:19.206]  It is our job, in this fertile ground, where people now are finally ready to hear the truth, to tell them the truth, and to get them the information.
[01:03:21.426 --> 01:03:24.547]  So the ball is in your court.
[01:03:24.907 --> 01:03:25.967]  Everybody out there.
[01:03:26.735 --> 01:03:32.578]  We're going to get more into that as well and more on the North American Union Plan headed to Congress this fall in just a few months.
[01:03:33.419 --> 01:03:38.382]  Also made in China, tainted food, fake drugs, and dodgy paint.
[01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:47.187]  And that goes into a bunch of other news we've got on China, the economy, the war, Al Gore's son being arrested.
[01:03:49.148 --> 01:03:50.949]  We'll also get into the pardons.
[01:03:56.161 --> 01:04:01.623]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:09.647]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.327 --> 01:04:17.390]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:29.215]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.515 --> 01:04:33.077]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.477 --> 01:04:35.438]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:39.600]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.803 --> 01:05:02.870]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.111 --> 01:05:14.360]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:19.504]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:05:19.724 --> 01:05:19.864]  I think?
[01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:39.189]  We're good.
[01:05:52.879 --> 01:05:57.160]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:02.241]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:02.481 --> 01:06:03.842]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:07.342]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:31.934]  Knowing they're all naturally safe.

[01:06:53.945 --> 01:06:59.547]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.647 --> 01:07:07.349]  All right, I'm going to get into the richest man in the world, surpassing Bill Gates, is Mexican.
[01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:12.450]  And then the number four, number six, and number ten guy are all Mexican.
[01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:23.054]  Triple the resources of the U.S., a huge enslaved population, and the elite of Mexico tell their poor people that the U.S.
[01:07:23.074 --> 01:07:23.775]  belongs to them.
[01:07:23.795 --> 01:07:29.477]  They've got to come up here if they want any wealth, when they've got, per capita, the richest elite in the world.
[01:07:30.797 --> 01:07:31.897]  This is from Reuters.
[01:07:32.498 --> 01:07:35.659]  Also, the deepening crisis with China and their goods.
[01:07:36.579 --> 01:07:39.160]  Upwards of 30% of it is contaminated.
[01:07:41.242 --> 01:07:43.643]  19% has been found to be contaminated by our inspectors.
[01:07:44.104 --> 01:07:46.304]  Upwards of 30% by Chinese inspectors.
[01:07:46.925 --> 01:07:47.965]  What's causing this?
[01:07:48.785 --> 01:07:52.227]  We'll go over that because I mean I didn't even know it was that serious.
[01:07:52.847 --> 01:07:54.848]  Jesse Benton is the
[01:07:56.028 --> 01:07:56.568]  I think so.
[01:08:14.757 --> 01:08:16.818]  And so we're going to be having him on sometime next week.
[01:08:17.518 --> 01:08:33.023]  But it's really great to have Jesse Benton on with us to give us a report on what happened in Iowa and where Ron Paul is going right now as the so-called media hype doesn't die on the internet, it just intensifies.
[01:08:33.043 --> 01:08:36.024]  Hey Alex, it's great to be with you.
[01:08:36.805 --> 01:08:40.926]  Thanks for having me, I mean thanks for having time to come on the show.
[01:08:42.982 --> 01:08:45.745]  Let's go into Iowa and what happened there.
[01:08:46.807 --> 01:08:51.612]  Well, just to give you listeners a little bit of background for those that haven't been following the story.
[01:08:52.252 --> 01:09:03.665]  Iowans for Tax Relief, which is a subsidiary, a chapter of the National Taxpayers Union, and the Iowa Christian Alliance held a candidate forum on this past Saturday.
[01:09:04.503 --> 01:09:09.428]  And when we learned about the forum about ten days prior, we realized Ron hadn't been invited.
[01:09:09.508 --> 01:09:17.776]  So we called Iowans for Tax Relief, supposedly a pro-taxpayer organization and taxpayer group that is a chapter of NTU.
[01:09:18.036 --> 01:09:25.483]  NTU, of course, being the group that consistently rates Ron as the best member of the House of Representatives when it comes to taxes and spending.
[01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:31.618]  Call them up and their executive director, Ed Thaler, rather curtly told us that Ron wasn't invited.
[01:09:31.678 --> 01:09:32.939]  It wasn't an oversight.
[01:09:32.999 --> 01:09:35.440]  He was, you know, he's being deliberately excluded.
[01:09:36.101 --> 01:09:37.281]  And that was that.
[01:09:37.602 --> 01:09:39.122]  And he wouldn't give us any answer.
[01:09:40.632 --> 01:09:42.854]  We decided that we weren't going to whine about it.
[01:09:43.354 --> 01:09:44.876]  We weren't going to complain.
[01:09:44.936 --> 01:09:48.999]  What we were going to do was go ahead and have an event in Iowa on that same day.
[01:09:49.660 --> 01:09:57.266]  So we went to Iowa, and in the city of Des Moines, we got space directly next to the Iowans for Tax Relief Forum.
[01:09:57.927 --> 01:10:00.729]  We started organizing this event about six days prior.
[01:10:00.769 --> 01:10:06.174]  So we started on Monday to have an event clear across the country in just six days.
[01:10:06.827 --> 01:10:09.448]  And we were actually, just had amazing turnout.
[01:10:09.468 --> 01:10:12.089]  We had about a thousand people come to hear Ron.
[01:10:12.689 --> 01:10:16.850]  You know, about half of them being Iowans, half of them being Ron Paul supporters from around the country.
[01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:19.151]  They just kind of flocked to Des Moines.
[01:10:19.311 --> 01:10:29.774]  And we had probably about 250 to 300 more people attend an event for just Ron than the Iowans for Tax Release Forum was able to produce for six candidates total.
[01:10:31.852 --> 01:10:34.293]  And that certainly was embarrassing for them.
[01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:44.396]  Now, the director of the group later tried to claim that it wasn't oversigned, but you guys did contact him and said, we do want to come, and they said no.
[01:10:44.416 --> 01:10:49.518]  Yeah, absolutely they said no, and they really kept changing their story as to exactly why.
[01:10:50.158 --> 01:10:55.180]  At first they said that these decisions were made months ago, and they made the decisions in March,
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:58.764]  Ron didn't have an Exploratory Committee in March, and we said, well, that's false.
[01:10:58.804 --> 01:11:00.126]  We filed in late January.
[01:11:00.547 --> 01:11:06.695]  And then they said, well, we only invite candidates that were polling at 1 or 2 percent in the polls in March.
[01:11:06.735 --> 01:11:11.862]  And we can show you plenty of polls where Ron was polling at 1 or 2 percent, and other folks that they invited weren't.
[01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:17.224]  And, uh, you know, so, you know, it was really just a lot of, uh, a lot of double talk, a lot of circling around.
[01:11:17.624 --> 01:11:25.648]  We felt just a little bit dishonesty to the voters of Iowa and to, uh, you know, to, you know, the American voters about exactly why he's being excluded.
[01:11:25.688 --> 01:11:27.789]  So it was just a little bit of a head scratcher, Alex.
[01:11:29.258 --> 01:11:36.162]  Well, it certainly is, and the reason I bring it back up is it's another example of the attempts to censor the congressman.
[01:11:36.182 --> 01:11:37.083]  But that's not working.
[01:11:37.103 --> 01:11:39.504]  You guys have been able to raise substantive funds.
[01:11:39.544 --> 01:11:40.485]  You still need more.
[01:11:41.225 --> 01:11:44.427]  What's the strategy in the future going into the next few weeks for the congressman?
[01:11:45.715 --> 01:11:49.318]  Well, he is going to be in Las Vegas, Nevada this weekend.
[01:11:49.759 --> 01:11:53.903]  Actually, the reason why there was a little bit of a schedule mix-up today was actually a positive one.
[01:11:53.963 --> 01:12:07.015]  He's heading back to Washington as we speak right now to record a feature interview on ABC this week with George Stephanopoulos, which is just about as big of a national media event opportunity as you can get.
[01:12:07.555 --> 01:12:08.776]  Then that will air on Sunday.
[01:12:08.796 --> 01:12:15.538]  He's going to be in Las Vegas speaking with Freedom Fest there and all those wonderful folks at that event and holding another rally.
[01:12:15.958 --> 01:12:20.960]  We're going out to San Francisco to meet with folks from Google and have another rally out there.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.961]  So basically, Alex, we're just going to continue to do what we're doing.
[01:12:24.001 --> 01:12:36.105]  We're going to continue to spread Ron's message of life and liberty and freedom and just continue to capitalize on this groundswell of support from around the country.
[01:12:37.176 --> 01:12:44.699]  Now, we had to reschedule today because of plane mix-ups, and just for the listeners, when are we going to be able to get the Congressman on?
[01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:46.759]  We will get him for you in the middle of next week.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:53.682]  Talk to Trey, your producer, offline after this interview, and we'll try to hammer down a day in the middle of next week.
[01:12:54.233 --> 01:12:55.554]  Well, we appreciate you, Jesse.
[01:12:55.594 --> 01:12:58.076]  We know you've been hammered from a million different sides.
[01:12:58.797 --> 01:13:07.263]  And, of course, interviewing the Congressman last month, he made the point that things have gone much better than they ever even thought they would, that he was running to basically inject
[01:13:08.207 --> 01:13:22.843]  You know, sound issues, end of the debate, and you know, he thought he had some chance of getting this much attention and some chance of getting the nomination, but I think with as much attention as the Congressmen's already got, that he could win New Hampshire.
[01:13:22.863 --> 01:13:29.990]  He could pull something like that off, and I mean, this would be an earth-shattering political event here in U.S.
[01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:30.471]  politics.
[01:13:31.011 --> 01:13:32.032]  Yeah, we think so too.
[01:13:32.333 --> 01:13:41.782]  And you know, Ron says in a speech he gave to a large rally in Kansas City a couple weeks ago that we've got a video up on our website right now, a YouTube video.
[01:13:42.603 --> 01:13:47.427]  You know, Ron addresses that and he says, you know, people ask me, where does this support on the internet come from?
[01:13:47.768 --> 01:13:48.648]  What's going on here?
[01:13:48.829 --> 01:13:49.990]  And he says, well, you know,
[01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:51.992]  I think freedom is popular.
[01:13:52.652 --> 01:13:53.873]  And freedom is popular.
[01:13:53.894 --> 01:13:55.055]  It's really resonating right now.
[01:13:55.075 --> 01:13:59.419]  The American people are really hungry for this message of liberty and limited government.
[01:14:00.019 --> 01:14:01.741]  And people are just turning on to it.
[01:14:01.781 --> 01:14:03.603]  It's absolutely amazing to be a part of.
[01:14:04.833 --> 01:14:05.493]  Absolutely.
[01:14:05.533 --> 01:14:07.553]  Well, listen, I'm going to let you get back to your important work.
[01:14:07.854 --> 01:14:14.995]  Jesse Benton, he is the media coordinator for Congressman Ron Paul's presidential campaign, 2008, running as a Republican.
[01:14:15.815 --> 01:14:21.276]  RonPaul2008.com or 1-800-RON-PAUL is the website.
[01:14:21.956 --> 01:14:23.936]  Anything else you want to add before we let you go?
[01:14:24.776 --> 01:14:25.256]  No, thank you.
[01:14:25.296 --> 01:14:29.757]  I just wanted to say thank you to you, Alex, and to all your listeners for all the wonderful things you guys do.
[01:14:30.017 --> 01:14:31.818]  No, thank you for coming on, Jesse.
[01:14:31.838 --> 01:14:32.258]  My pleasure.
[01:14:32.358 --> 01:14:33.158]  We'll talk to you soon.
[01:14:34.784 --> 01:14:35.765]  There goes Jesse Benton.
[01:14:35.785 --> 01:14:36.865]  Well that's some good news.
[01:14:36.925 --> 01:14:42.589]  Going to be on the TV show, that big Sunday show with Stephanopoulos.
[01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:46.712]  So that certainly will be a large audience.
[01:14:46.912 --> 01:14:50.294]  I think 5-6 million people watch that.
[01:14:50.334 --> 01:14:54.417]  So steadily but surely, Ron Paul's name is getting out there.
[01:14:55.517 --> 01:15:01.021]  The reason the Las Vegas bookies are saying he's a viable candidate
[01:15:04.278 --> 01:15:11.464]  Is because he's growing so quickly, and the election is still so far off.
[01:15:11.484 --> 01:15:15.747]  I mean, they've given their reason for their analysis, and frankly, it's the same analysis I put out.
[01:15:15.787 --> 01:15:16.488]  It's common sense.
[01:15:16.528 --> 01:15:18.590]  It's not that hard to figure out.
[01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:21.692]  They're trying to bet on reality, not on hype.
[01:15:21.812 --> 01:15:31.000]  See, the media is trying to hype Ron Paul down, claiming it's hype, claiming he doesn't have any real support, claiming that he's just a flash in the pan.
[01:15:31.784 --> 01:15:33.866]  Because that can then take on reality.
[01:15:33.886 --> 01:15:37.248]  People will believe that and say, well, he's not a viable candidate.
[01:15:37.848 --> 01:15:40.130]  I would have voted for Ron Paul.
[01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:45.054]  I would have supported Ron Paul, but I can't support him because he can't win.
[01:15:46.034 --> 01:15:51.118]  Well, if they would have said that in 1776, we wouldn't exist right now.
[01:15:51.218 --> 01:15:52.739]  This country wouldn't exist right now.
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.141]  And our parents
[01:15:55.911 --> 01:15:56.311]  We're good to go.
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:20.181]  And the truth is, you have believed out there, and you've taken action, regardless.
[01:16:20.641 --> 01:16:21.781]  He's given them a good run.
[01:16:21.841 --> 01:16:36.184]  But it's not just the fact that he's gaining momentum, and if he continues to gain momentum, will win, according to the Las Vegas bookies, the odds makers, who have always been very accurate, because big money rides on it, free market rides on it.
[01:16:37.504 --> 01:16:40.525]  But they've also said the same thing that we've been saying since day one.
[01:16:41.557 --> 01:16:48.282]  Only Ron Paul can beat the Democratic candidate, who will probably be Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama, but probably Hillary.
[01:16:49.043 --> 01:16:51.205]  Now they've got Bill Clinton out there running around.
[01:16:51.245 --> 01:16:52.526]  It just goes from bad to worse.
[01:16:53.446 --> 01:17:00.592]  And I know most of you already understand this, but we put the word out, we've written the article, Only Ron Paul Can Defeat Hillary.
[01:17:00.632 --> 01:17:02.053]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:17:02.513 --> 01:17:06.256]  Type Only Ron Paul Can Defeat Hillary Clinton into Google.
[01:17:06.316 --> 01:17:09.359]  Find that article we put out a couple months ago and get it out to conservatives.
[01:17:09.981 --> 01:17:12.023]  And say, do you really want Hillary Clinton in?
[01:17:12.743 --> 01:17:13.564]  And ask liberals!
[01:17:14.265 --> 01:17:16.306]  Do you want Hillary who's pro-war in there?
[01:17:17.287 --> 01:17:19.489]  Who's just basically George Bush with a wig on?
[01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:21.951]  George Bush in a dress?
[01:17:22.131 --> 01:17:23.052]  Bill Clinton in a dress?
[01:17:23.112 --> 01:17:24.973]  I mean, do we want more of this?
[01:17:26.434 --> 01:17:29.817]  By the way, Jesse Jackson Jr.
[01:17:31.238 --> 01:17:38.364]  has come out and is saying Bush needs to be impeached, and Bush is a criminal, and Bush is the worst president, and all of that is true!
[01:17:40.035 --> 01:17:42.716]  But Jesse Jackson and Jesse Jackson Jr.
[01:17:42.776 --> 01:17:53.718]  are giving media attention because they've got so many skeletons in their closet, and Jackson's got so many illegitimate children, he's been involved in so many shakedowns, that he has no credibility.
[01:17:55.898 --> 01:18:05.720]  And so when the Democrats criticize Bush, conservatives all laugh and say, well wait a minute, didn't Bill Clinton give pardons to convicted cocaine dealers?
[01:18:06.901 --> 01:18:08.341]  And didn't Bill Clinton give
[01:18:09.116 --> 01:18:13.178]  Pardons to, what was it, 10 members of the F.A.L.N.
[01:18:13.618 --> 01:18:17.600]  slash Weathermen who carried out over 130 bombings.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.760]  I mean, they killed police.
[01:18:20.721 --> 01:18:27.064]  They blinded more than 15 police because the bombs, the cops would open them and they'd blow their faces off.
[01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.605]  Just out of the blue they'd bomb cops.
[01:18:31.846 --> 01:18:32.886]  Oh, but that's okay.
[01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:42.774]  The bigger question is, why would Bill Clinton pardon people, because they had dirt on them folks, that's why, who bombed cops?
[01:18:44.296 --> 01:18:50.144]  See, we're going to come back, talk about the pardons, and get into Al Gore's son being arrested.
[01:18:50.164 --> 01:18:50.565]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.582 --> 01:18:55.524]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:56.225]  Look!
[01:18:56.645 --> 01:18:57.706]  Up there in the sky!
[01:18:58.127 --> 01:18:59.448]  It's Non-X-Man!
[01:18:59.828 --> 01:19:00.950]  He's in a dive!
[01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:03.272]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[01:19:03.592 --> 01:19:04.353]  Let's go look.
[01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:09.758]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[01:19:10.159 --> 01:19:11.520]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:19:11.740 --> 01:19:12.161]  Take them out.
[01:19:12.788 --> 01:19:13.468]  Let's see.
[01:19:13.488 --> 01:19:18.070]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.890]  Don't worry.
[01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:20.851]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:21.471 --> 01:19:25.892]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:19:26.432 --> 01:19:28.473]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[01:19:28.613 --> 01:19:31.354]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:19:33.474 --> 01:19:36.095]  Don't let Non-X Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:19:36.575 --> 01:19:40.056]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:19:40.577 --> 01:19:41.937]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super
[01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:57.610]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us up the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:19:57.650 --> 01:19:58.911]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:19:59.071 --> 01:20:02.652]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:20:02.932 --> 01:20:05.453]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:20:05.853 --> 01:20:07.594]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:20:07.914 --> 01:20:10.075]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:20:11.275 --> 01:20:21.719]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:20:21.759 --> 01:20:25.701]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:20:25.781 --> 01:20:28.862]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:20:29.062 --> 01:20:31.523]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:20:31.603 --> 01:20:34.564]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:34.765]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.067 --> 01:20:43.252]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:20:44.134 --> 01:20:46.779]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:47.641]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[01:20:53.001 --> 01:20:58.206]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:20:58.366 --> 01:21:06.453]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:21:06.713 --> 01:21:13.779]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:21:13.939 --> 01:21:15.240]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:21.204]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:21:21.404 --> 01:21:26.488]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:21:26.608 --> 01:21:35.494]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:21:35.734 --> 01:21:39.257]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:21:41.138 --> 01:21:45.120]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:21:46.001 --> 01:21:47.562]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:21:47.782 --> 01:21:50.543]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:53.185 --> 01:21:53.605]  Attention!
[01:21:53.725 --> 01:21:56.547]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:21:56.827 --> 01:22:01.129]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:02.150]  Listen closely.
[01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:08.193]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most
[01:22:08.413 --> 01:22:08.733]  I think so.
[01:22:25.405 --> 01:22:34.869]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:22:35.069 --> 01:22:40.691]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:22:40.891 --> 01:22:44.472]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:48.034]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[01:23:03.029 --> 01:23:06.831]  Alright!
[01:23:08.251 --> 01:23:20.535]  Tipper Gore, I distinctly remember tromping all over TV, radio, print, going back to when her husband was just a senator calling for a bigger, badder drug war.
[01:23:22.056 --> 01:23:28.418]  And Al Gore and Bill Clinton radically expanded the war against liberty and freedom in this country.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.882]  They have put so many young people in prison.
[01:23:35.563 --> 01:23:40.047]  And watching the news, listening to the news, you know, I read the news wires.
[01:23:40.107 --> 01:23:42.949]  He was busted with five different prescription narcotics.
[01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:46.692]  He was busted with an ounce of marijuana.
[01:23:49.214 --> 01:23:52.056]  And I want him to spend at least ten years in prison.
[01:23:54.038 --> 01:23:54.959]  Now, of course he won't.
[01:23:55.399 --> 01:23:58.802]  Limbaugh can be caught buying thousands of hillbilly heroin pills.
[01:24:00.052 --> 01:24:08.078]  Oxycontin, and I heard him many times say, remember him doing shows about, oh, these black kids get caught with cocaine.
[01:24:08.118 --> 01:24:10.980]  Yeah, they say it's racist to have mandatory sentencing.
[01:24:11.501 --> 01:24:12.441]  Well, I say it isn't.
[01:24:12.541 --> 01:24:13.062]  It's good.
[01:24:13.122 --> 01:24:14.863]  Ten years, first offense.
[01:24:15.744 --> 01:24:17.685]  Well, Limbaugh, you slob.
[01:24:18.666 --> 01:24:19.426]  You hypocrite.
[01:24:20.147 --> 01:24:22.308]  You went on air and whined and cried.
[01:24:22.649 --> 01:24:24.450]  By the way, I don't think you should go to jail, Limbaugh.
[01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:28.233]  I don't think Al Gore's son should go to jail if you weren't hypocrites.
[01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:34.975]  And thank God I never got into drugs and never liked them.
[01:24:36.979 --> 01:24:43.171]  But I know people that have been on them and they don't deserve to go to prison just because they had addictive personalities and this stuff's addictive.
[01:24:45.362 --> 01:24:47.923]  Let me give people in about 60 seconds the history of drugs.
[01:24:48.263 --> 01:24:56.545]  Heroin and cocaine and other drugs were sold at pharmacies and on the backs of wagons by the snake oil salesmen right up until the 1930s.
[01:24:56.985 --> 01:25:01.286]  Then they had to end their prohibition, so they made drugs illegal instead of alcohol.
[01:25:01.807 --> 01:25:06.808]  And the very same families that literally set up Skull and Bones and the rest of it, that's mainstream history books,
[01:25:07.691 --> 01:25:15.693]  Made it illegal so they could jack up their profits and use the police they control to go after other companies that were shipping the drugs in illegally.
[01:25:17.454 --> 01:25:22.775]  Okay, they made it illegal to jack up the prices and to be able to selectively enforce and go after competition.
[01:25:23.355 --> 01:25:32.778]  So don't you ever run around in your goon uniforms and pull me over and say, I want to look for drugs, if I laugh at you it's because I don't use your trash.
[01:25:33.573 --> 01:25:35.593]  And I don't use the legal stuff you push either.
[01:25:35.934 --> 01:25:41.115]  The Ritalin, the Prozac, the Luvox, whose molecules are even more dangerous than the illegal drugs.
[01:25:41.835 --> 01:25:46.136]  I don't use any of your trash, and I'm even starting to phase out coffee.
[01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:49.997]  Instead of having three or four cups already, I've had one cup.
[01:25:50.637 --> 01:25:58.899]  I'm getting off all of your trash, all of your garbage, all of your filth, that you push on my children, that you push on the whole country.
[01:26:00.493 --> 01:26:10.278]  Now, I want Al Gore III arrested, and I want this piece of trash to spend at least 10 years in prison, and I want it now!
[01:26:14.481 --> 01:26:18.683]  Now that's only fair, and that's only common sense.
[01:26:20.684 --> 01:26:21.765]  And that's what needs to happen.
[01:26:22.905 --> 01:26:27.548]  And I want him to be charged with reckless driving, going down a major highway at
[01:26:28.869 --> 01:26:31.550]  Around 100 miles an hour, drugged out of his gourd.
[01:26:32.271 --> 01:26:34.371]  That is why, now I do think you should go to jail for that.
[01:26:34.772 --> 01:26:42.315]  I'm not for drug crimes and drug, you know, the whole crime war, the whole drug war.
[01:26:42.915 --> 01:26:43.575]  But I am.
[01:26:46.116 --> 01:26:47.357]  I am against reckless driving.
[01:26:47.927 --> 01:26:50.589]  I mean, he's on drugs, driving 100 miles an hour.
[01:26:51.129 --> 01:27:05.499]  I want him and that slob, that anti-American liberal piece of trash, Rush Limbaugh, that fake, meant to neutralize conservatives, meant to bring in the new world order, never talking about North American Union, never talking about any of it.
[01:27:05.779 --> 01:27:07.761]  I want that piece of trash in prison.
[01:27:08.661 --> 01:27:10.622]  And I want this piece of trash in prison.
[01:27:10.862 --> 01:27:13.523]  Of course, if Limbaugh's doctor said he went to prison, he'd die.
[01:27:13.983 --> 01:27:17.704]  He was so drugged out, folks, the times he's had to get off of it, and he always went back.
[01:27:18.325 --> 01:27:20.245]  They had to put him under for several days.
[01:27:21.106 --> 01:27:24.987]  They had to use one narcotic to bring him under, to get him off the other narcotic.
[01:27:25.327 --> 01:27:30.949]  He has to go through withdrawals, unconscious, in an induced coma.
[01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:35.311]  Now, obviously, I don't think Limbaugh should go to prison.
[01:27:35.931 --> 01:27:37.912]  But, he's a criminal hypocrite.
[01:27:39.989 --> 01:27:43.631]  He is a piece of trash and an enemy of the Republic.
[01:27:45.012 --> 01:27:49.035]  I know a lot of people whose teenagers get caught with three or four pills.
[01:27:49.715 --> 01:27:50.095]  Boom.
[01:27:51.937 --> 01:27:58.201]  They spend a month in jail, then they get on probation, then they get caught doing something else five years later and their lives are over.
[01:27:59.601 --> 01:28:02.443]  I want Al Gore III's life to be ruined.
[01:28:03.004 --> 01:28:05.265]  And I want Rush Limbaugh's life to be ruined.
[01:28:06.005 --> 01:28:08.087]  And I want their lives ruined NOW!
[01:28:09.733 --> 01:28:17.796]  And his feudalist daddy, his daddy pushing his one world government's global tax right now, you can take one look at that guy and tell you he's on drugs.
[01:28:18.116 --> 01:28:19.377]  Have you looked at him lately?
[01:28:20.597 --> 01:28:22.678]  Bunch of drug addict scum.
[01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.540]  Alright, we'll be right back with our guest.
[01:28:28.461 --> 01:28:35.503]  I'm also going to get into China, made in China, tainted food, fake drugs, and dodgy paint.
[01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:37.784]  And the crisis accelerates.
[01:28:38.224 --> 01:28:38.805]  What's it mean?
[01:28:38.825 --> 01:28:39.385]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.479 --> 01:28:46.507]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:50.117]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.365 --> 01:28:57.407]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:28:57.627 --> 01:29:01.029]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:29:01.190 --> 01:29:04.712]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:29:04.952 --> 01:29:08.154]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:29:08.174 --> 01:29:13.697]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:29:13.717 --> 01:29:18.880]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:20.501]  Thank you for your time.
[01:29:36.815 --> 01:29:40.280]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:41.482]  That toll free number again?
[01:29:41.502 --> 01:29:41.562]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:57.932]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:29:58.313 --> 01:30:05.637]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:06.078 --> 01:30:17.025]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:17.105 --> 01:30:17.565]  Central.
[01:30:17.905 --> 01:30:23.509]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:30:23.849 --> 01:30:29.751]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:30.231 --> 01:30:34.973]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:35.353 --> 01:30:40.154]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:40.594 --> 01:30:41.895]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:41.955 --> 01:30:42.375]  Central.
[01:30:42.955 --> 01:30:50.378]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:30:53.465 --> 01:30:55.987]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:56.627 --> 01:31:05.872]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:31:06.793 --> 01:31:13.597]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:31:14.497 --> 01:31:15.958]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:31:16.158 --> 01:31:19.220]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[01:31:20.194 --> 01:31:28.722]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:31:29.583 --> 01:31:31.144]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:31.164 --> 01:31:31.504]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:31:43.579 --> 01:31:44.200]  Call now.
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:50.929]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:32:21.267 --> 01:32:36.035]  We're going to have historian, journalist, and filmmaker David Bay to discuss his work, researching and exploring the links between the inception of the United States government, current national and global news headlines, and biblical prophecy.
[01:32:36.075 --> 01:32:42.778]  His new film, Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 2, Riddles in Stone, is the second in a seven-part series.
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:47.522]  Touching on all major categories of David's lifetime of research.
[01:32:47.542 --> 01:32:53.025]  We're going to have the filmmaker on simultaneously, first time we've done this, having them both up together.
[01:32:53.045 --> 01:32:53.926]  They're both great men.
[01:32:53.946 --> 01:32:59.029]  Now when it comes to research, we really appreciate their work and their contribution to the fight against the New World Order.
[01:32:59.693 --> 01:33:19.183]  We'll be joined by Christian J. Pinto, the award-winning director of the incredible films Riddles in Stone, the latest in the Secret Mysteries of America's beginning series, to discuss the documentary and his vast knowledge of occult symbology concealed within the architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:33:19.203 --> 01:33:21.024]  and, of course, most other capitals.
[01:33:21.324 --> 01:33:23.526]  We'll be going over that with him in just a few minutes.
[01:33:25.151 --> 01:33:30.635]  If you do want to get Riddles in Stone, we have it available right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:33:32.096 --> 01:33:44.265]  I mean, this is professionally produced like any Discovery Channel show you'd see with the really super budget on costumes and the camera work and the documentation and everything.
[01:33:44.545 --> 01:33:46.166]  I mean, these are really well done.
[01:33:46.807 --> 01:33:49.749]  These are theatrical, cinematically portrayed.
[01:33:52.501 --> 01:33:55.003]  So the column documentaries might not even be right.
[01:33:55.023 --> 01:33:59.006]  It's kind of a... It's a dramatized documentary.
[01:33:59.806 --> 01:34:05.270]  Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington D.C., Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, Volume 2.
[01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:06.771]  You need to get this.
[01:34:06.931 --> 01:34:17.678]  Also, we're only a week or two away, or maybe even sooner, to shipping out the new Terror Storm Special Edition.
[01:34:18.339 --> 01:34:19.379]  The last edition I'll do.
[01:34:19.439 --> 01:34:21.541]  It's the second edition, but it's really a
[01:34:22.687 --> 01:34:23.688]  I've never known what to call it.
[01:34:24.928 --> 01:34:26.129]  In truth, it's a second edition.
[01:34:26.169 --> 01:34:27.430]  It's just an expanded version.
[01:34:28.110 --> 01:34:36.635]  And it's got 17 minutes of new information on Building 7, on the BBC reporting that it was going to collapse before it collapsed, along with CNN.
[01:34:36.655 --> 01:34:40.717]  It's got Jesse Ventura, the governor, talking about inside job.
[01:34:41.217 --> 01:34:45.759]  It's got Gore Vidal, Gore's cousin, talking about inside job.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:50.542]  It's got new CIA officials going public saying it's an inside job.
[01:34:51.344 --> 01:34:53.906]  It's got a lot of new video and audio.
[01:34:54.026 --> 01:35:01.810]  I mean, it's got 17 totally new minutes, but then the rest of it's been remastered, new audio added, more music added, more video images added.
[01:35:03.951 --> 01:35:09.354]  Basically, what happens is I rush a film out, and it was super good, the first edition, but then we get to come back.
[01:35:09.374 --> 01:35:14.357]  It's been three or four months adding to it, doing things we wanted to do, mixing it better.
[01:35:14.577 --> 01:35:16.478]  That's the new Terror Storm we have.
[01:35:16.578 --> 01:35:20.400]  We have it here in stock, but can't ship it until the middle of this month.
[01:35:21.681 --> 01:35:24.843]  And so I just hope that you will order it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:24.904 --> 01:35:33.469]  It will be on store shelves at the end of this month across the country with the special edition of Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:40.574]  You can go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:41.515 --> 01:35:44.877]  And if you go to prisonplanet.tv, you can go there and download
[01:35:46.597 --> 01:35:51.299]  All of my films in super high quality and burned them to disk.
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:58.403]  It is a factory of resistance, an armory of resistance, an arsenal of resistance in the information war.
[01:35:58.463 --> 01:36:04.046]  Whether it's my police state films or Road to Tyranny or Masters of Terror, Martial Law,
[01:36:05.074 --> 01:36:05.914]  They're all there.
[01:36:06.014 --> 01:36:19.040]  Hundreds of my weekly TV shows, hundreds of in-studio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.TV, and your purchase and your support over at PrisonPlanet.TV makes everything we do here possible.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:25.222]  You can also call to get riddles in stone or to loose change, second edition, or any of the films I carry.
[01:36:27.083 --> 01:36:28.964]  Like America, freedom to fascism,
[01:36:29.939 --> 01:36:36.083]  9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions, they're all available at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:36:36.103 --> 01:36:36.323]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:36:36.343 --> 01:36:41.325]  Now going to our guest, let's go ahead and introduce Christian Pinto, the award-winning filmmaker.
[01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:43.627]  This is his second film in this series.
[01:36:57.686 --> 01:37:05.768]  And to talk about how he woke up to the New World Order, to this overall occult empire, this occult language, this system.
[01:37:05.788 --> 01:37:09.409]  This is like learning French or learning German, folks.
[01:37:09.809 --> 01:37:14.150]  This is the secret numerological language of the ruling class.
[01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:18.411]  This is literally their codified worship of Lucifer.
[01:37:19.171 --> 01:37:20.571]  They believe the devil is God.
[01:37:20.611 --> 01:37:24.292]  They don't worship the devil, they believe they worship God, who they call Lucifer.
[01:37:25.413 --> 01:37:26.833]  That's an important distinction there.
[01:37:27.446 --> 01:37:29.427]  And then we'll go to David Bay.
[01:37:30.608 --> 01:37:32.009]  Mr. Pinto, thanks for coming on.
[01:37:32.570 --> 01:37:33.530]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:37:33.610 --> 01:37:34.711]  It's good to be back on the show.
[01:37:35.151 --> 01:37:35.471]  You bet.
[01:37:35.512 --> 01:37:41.396]  Tell us how you woke up, how you got involved, how you got informed, and then how you hooked up with David Bay.
[01:37:43.317 --> 01:37:49.741]  You've got your next one coming out, I guess, next year, but you've got the first two editions out right now.
[01:37:49.761 --> 01:37:52.163]  I mean, how did you awaken to all this?
[01:37:52.943 --> 01:38:05.815]  Well, you know, I'd been a Christian for a number of years and had really focused a lot on studying the scriptures and then I got into Bible prophecy at some point and started working on a documentary series called Megiddo, the March to Armageddon.
[01:38:06.768 --> 01:38:16.297]  Where I did a lot of research surrounding the New World Order and how this whole system is coming together in fulfillment of Bible prophecy.
[01:38:16.457 --> 01:38:19.020]  And that led me into a lot of historical information.
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:26.327]  In fact, I remember reading the book, The New World Order Ancient Plan of Secret Societies by William T. Still.
[01:38:26.927 --> 01:38:46.105]  And there he talks about the Great Atlantean Plan, and it was this plan that was hatched by Sir Francis Bacon to send secret societies into the New World and to launch America, the American Empire, as this new Atlantean Empire that would one day extend to all the world.
[01:38:46.705 --> 01:38:53.988]  And so that's where I first encountered that whole idea and so on, and Phil gives really an abbreviated version of it.
[01:38:54.549 --> 01:39:08.695]  And so that kind of started my research on it, but at the same time, I was doing a certain amount of research through Cutting Edge, David's ministry, and I had been reading Cutting Edge for several years, and David writes about a lot of the same things.
[01:39:09.296 --> 01:39:11.737]  And so after I had produced a couple of
[01:39:12.797 --> 01:39:13.798]  We're good to go.
[01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:43.755]  It's been a really fascinating journey, studying not only the whole New Atlantis concept and this idea, as you were talking about, that in these occult societies, they don't necessarily believe that they are worshipping
[01:39:44.896 --> 01:39:45.937]  Satan, per se.
[01:39:45.957 --> 01:39:51.383]  In fact, they reject the idea of Satanism as it's presented from a Christian perspective.
[01:39:51.683 --> 01:39:54.006]  You read the writings of Albert Pike.
[01:39:54.066 --> 01:39:57.409]  He calls the doctrine of Satanism a heresy, and so on.
[01:39:58.130 --> 01:40:01.634]  And Madame H. P. Blavatsky in her book, The Secret Doctrine.
[01:40:02.274 --> 01:40:14.927]  She writes about this as well, and she makes reference to exactly what you were talking about, but she uses a Latin phrase called demon est Deus inversus, and that is, the devil is God inverted.
[01:40:15.387 --> 01:40:18.010]  And what they do is they go back to the Garden of Eden account,
[01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:22.332]  And they turn God, okay, Yahweh, into the devil.
[01:40:22.772 --> 01:40:28.676]  He's this evil god that Albert Pike calls Ialdabaoth in his book Morals and Dogma.
[01:40:29.156 --> 01:40:32.158]  And he's the demiurge, he's the creator of the material world.
[01:40:32.178 --> 01:40:34.319]  This is an ancient Gnostic teaching as well.
[01:40:35.059 --> 01:40:42.243]  And he created Adam and Eve and then forbade Adam and Eve to partake of the Tree of Knowledge, Gnosis, which is where Gnosticism comes from.
[01:40:42.664 --> 01:40:46.726]  But the serpent shows up, Lucifer, and he's the Angel of Light.
[01:40:47.344 --> 01:40:59.635]  And so he's going to now, he bids Adam and Eve to give up the idea of just being these mindless robots who are obeying God and to partake of knowledge so that their eyes can be opened and they can become their own gods.
[01:41:00.195 --> 01:41:09.403]  And the idea is that God, the Creator God, is really holding out on mankind and doesn't want mankind to achieve their own godhood.
[01:41:10.024 --> 01:41:12.126]  And they write about this at great length.
[01:41:12.826 --> 01:41:20.935]  And I was really surprised in doing the research at how many of these occult societies thoroughly believe this doctrine.
[01:41:20.995 --> 01:41:29.744]  This is the doctrine believed not only by Madame Blavatsky, but by Manley P. Hall, who is called by the Scottish Rite Journal, Masonry's greatest philosopher.
[01:41:30.184 --> 01:41:32.647]  This is what's espoused by Albert Pike.
[01:41:33.087 --> 01:41:38.892]  This is what's espoused by secret groups like the Order of the Golden Dawn.
[01:41:39.853 --> 01:41:47.378]  It's a theology or a belief system that permeates all occult doctrine, and it is exactly what Blavatsky says.
[01:41:47.539 --> 01:41:49.740]  It's the reversing of God and the devil.
[01:41:51.362 --> 01:41:52.783]  Let's bring in David Bray.
[01:41:54.004 --> 01:42:13.513]  David, I mean, literally the foundation of the United States, so much of the entire world system, and by the way, they worship the exact same gods under different names in Japan, in China, in Africa, in groups and people who supposedly never even came together until 500, 600 years ago.
[01:42:14.453 --> 01:42:20.516]  So even if we have an atheist listening today, or tens of thousands of atheists listening, or agnostics,
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:24.261]  They'll say, I don't believe in the devil, so you guys are a bunch of kooks.
[01:42:24.401 --> 01:42:25.041]  It doesn't matter.
[01:42:25.501 --> 01:42:48.028]  What we're covering here is a historical fact, and obviously because we're Christians, that's what caused us to look into this to begin with, and that's why you tend to find what I would call real Christians who are concerned with this, because it fits in exactly with what the Bible says, but it is a hardcore fact that world leaders really are into the occult,
[01:42:48.608 --> 01:42:51.470]  They really do make every major decision according to it.
[01:42:52.311 --> 01:42:57.454]  And I'm right here in Austin, Texas, where they've got a giant black pentagram right behind the Capitol.
[01:42:57.754 --> 01:42:59.535]  They've got a goddess on top of the Capitol.
[01:42:59.635 --> 01:43:00.756]  It's all occultic.
[01:43:01.797 --> 01:43:04.118]  I mean, it's just all right out in the open.
[01:43:05.359 --> 01:43:07.100]  I mean, there's not even a debate about it.
[01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:15.205]  And then we're supposed to act like this 500-pound gorilla isn't on our back, or this million-pound elephant isn't sitting in our living room.
[01:43:15.805 --> 01:43:16.646]  Can you speak to that?
[01:43:17.955 --> 01:43:23.317]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:43:23.437 --> 01:43:40.503]  The current leadership today, what is commonly called the global elite, the Bilderbergers, Skull and Bones, of which President Bush is a member, they all firmly believe in this Luciferian versus God concept.
[01:43:42.564 --> 01:43:46.165]  This is what we try to bring out constantly in this video.
[01:43:46.587 --> 01:43:53.891]  We're not talking about something abstract here, or something in history that is interesting but irrelevant to today.
[01:43:53.911 --> 01:44:15.463]  I mean, we're talking about the fact that the people who control the armies, navies, air forces of the world, and the nuclear weapons, and all the exotic weapons of the world, these guys believe this, and these guys have an agenda that they boldly put right out into the public.
[01:44:16.170 --> 01:44:26.532]  And that's the thing that Riddleton Stone was so interesting for us, is that, you know, Adolf Hitler said that many times the best way to hide something is to put it right out in the open.
[01:44:27.312 --> 01:44:36.074]  And these monuments and paintings and sculptures are right out in the open and they tell a story.
[01:44:36.594 --> 01:44:42.195]  They tell a story that, once you understand it, tells you why we're in Iraq and Afghanistan and tells you where we're headed.
[01:44:43.502 --> 01:44:44.343]  It's quite the story.
[01:44:44.844 --> 01:44:45.605]  Absolutely.
[01:44:46.065 --> 01:44:50.851]  Let's go back to Mr. Pinto and let him elaborate, then we'll come back after the break and talk to Mr. Pei.
[01:44:53.641 --> 01:45:10.653]  Well, I was thinking as David was talking about a contact that we made, a Christian man who happens to be a police officer who works inside the Capitol building there in Washington, D.C., and he's part of their elite security.
[01:45:10.694 --> 01:45:20.761]  In fact, there were things about his job he couldn't tell us and so on, but he was a great guy and he was reading, he was following the progress of the documentary as we were posting things on the Internet and so on.
[01:45:21.301 --> 01:45:24.663]  And he called us up and he said, you know, you guys are working on this film.
[01:45:24.703 --> 01:45:28.104]  Have you had the opportunity to get inside any of the buildings here?
[01:45:28.524 --> 01:45:29.365]  And we said, well, no.
[01:45:29.385 --> 01:45:33.827]  And he said, well, what if I could get you inside the Capitol and the Senate and so on?
[01:45:34.467 --> 01:45:36.328]  And so he got us inside.
[01:45:36.348 --> 01:45:38.129]  So the interior footage that you see,
[01:45:39.009 --> 01:45:42.391]  Uh, from Riddles and Stone, was literally shot by me.
[01:45:42.472 --> 01:45:53.559]  I flew over there with a camera, kept it small, and this guy with his security badge was able to walk me around and show me the inside of the Capitol, show me things that he walks past every single day.
[01:45:54.379 --> 01:46:10.152]  We've got all kinds of Masonic and Rosicrucian and outright, you know, very blatantly occult symbols and phrases and so on, that once you understand them, it's easily recognizable and undeniable that they come out of occult philosophy.
[01:46:11.193 --> 01:46:14.996]  And so, after we finished the film, we sent him a copy.
[01:46:15.888 --> 01:46:27.435]  And he ended up talking to him on the phone like a month after we had finished Riddles in Stone, and he said that so many people that he had talked to there who live in the Washington, D.C.
[01:46:27.595 --> 01:46:31.898]  area and who walk by this stuff every day, that they are
[01:46:32.478 --> 01:46:38.481]  Deeply impacted and amazed when they see the film because they had no idea what they were seeing.
[01:46:38.881 --> 01:46:40.842]  Even though they're walking by it all the time.
[01:46:41.123 --> 01:46:44.364]  But until somebody explains it to you, it's right out there in the open.
[01:46:44.404 --> 01:46:45.445]  It's in plain sight.
[01:46:45.745 --> 01:46:50.407]  Well, that's the point that I'm trying to make to the agnostics and the atheists.
[01:46:50.548 --> 01:46:52.008]  I'm not here to beat them over the head.
[01:46:52.469 --> 01:46:54.189]  I'm not here to you need to lead a horse to water.
[01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:55.050]  You can't make it drink.
[01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:58.893]  I'm not here to get into an argument with them about religion.
[01:46:59.033 --> 01:47:07.742]  I'm telling them, just as a sociologist, just as an anthropologist would, or a societal psychologist, that this is real.
[01:47:07.942 --> 01:47:14.628]  And I, 15 years ago, when I started getting involved, and 13 years ago on air, I never looked for this stuff.
[01:47:14.688 --> 01:47:18.892]  I was talking about the Federal Reserve, and let's cut taxes, and Second Amendment.
[01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.474]  I mean, I was a mainline conservative.
[01:47:21.014 --> 01:47:26.416]  And in my research, because I took a scholarly approach to it, I always ran into this occult stuff.
[01:47:26.556 --> 01:47:37.500]  And it is the main governing force, the main organizing tie that binds through everything.
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:39.001]  It is the central column.
[01:47:39.782 --> 01:47:46.826]  And, or the keystone to use their term, and we want to know where we come from, where we're at, where we're going.
[01:47:47.346 --> 01:47:49.808]  We've got to see riddles in stone.
[01:47:49.868 --> 01:47:51.529]  We've got to learn the truth.
[01:47:52.711 --> 01:48:18.284]  Yeah, there's even a quote that we take from Manley P. Hall, who, the more that I research Hall, the more I realize his influence, not only upon the philosophy of these guys through the 20th century, but there are certain links between Hall and the highest powers in government, FDR, apparently, sent people to Hall's Philosophic Research Society back in the 1940s.
[01:48:20.505 --> 01:48:27.407]  ...to microfiche all of Hall's research, and he had been gathering all these ancient manuscripts on occult writings and things like that.
[01:48:27.907 --> 01:48:36.410]  But Hall talks about, you know, one of his chief teachings was about America and the destiny of America, something that FDR talked about.
[01:48:36.810 --> 01:48:45.173]  But he talked about how the pagan intellectuals had reclothed their original ideas in a garment of Christian phraseology.
[01:48:45.919 --> 01:48:54.245]  Okay, but they bestowed the real secrets, the meanings of their signs and symbols only upon those who had been duly initiated and bound to secrecy.
[01:48:54.786 --> 01:49:09.677]  And he's literally describing the deception of these secret societies in presenting themselves outwardly as though they hold to Christian values and Christian ideas and so on, so that they can win the approval of the American people.
[01:49:10.157 --> 01:49:16.659]  But inwardly, they have an inner program, an inner doctrine, and they are, you know, permeating our government.
[01:49:16.699 --> 01:49:22.260]  They're, you know, putting up all their signs and symbols and philosophies and so on, all around the American government.
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:29.182]  And many people, somehow or other, incredibly, have been duped into thinking that this is all part of our Judeo-Christian heritage.
[01:49:30.962 --> 01:49:39.504]  And then now they will defend all of their occult symbolism and get in our face and tell us that we're bad, if we even point it out.
[01:49:40.499 --> 01:49:50.003]  Again, folks, we're in a lot of trouble, and they're doing all this in Christianity's name, demonizing the U.S., demonizing Christianity, all part of the larger plan.
[01:49:51.224 --> 01:50:01.868]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:09.852]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.566 --> 01:50:17.610]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.030 --> 01:50:29.456]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.756 --> 01:50:33.278]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.719 --> 01:50:35.680]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:39.762]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:53.010 --> 01:51:54.731]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:54.951 --> 01:51:58.653]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:58.973 --> 01:52:01.194]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:13.762]  My friends, it is not a minority, it is not a majority.
[01:53:14.582 --> 01:53:22.845]  It is the vast majority of elites, I mean high-level billionaires and upwards, that are into the occult.
[01:53:23.845 --> 01:53:28.707]  I have never met one, I have never talked to one who wasn't into the occult.
[01:53:30.948 --> 01:53:35.089]  And, uh, it's just, it's just incredible.
[01:53:35.529 --> 01:53:37.750]  I keep using that word because it is incredible.
[01:53:38.732 --> 01:53:47.937]  That we have an elite who governs the nuclear weapons, all the advanced bio-weapons, who believe Mother Earth wants them to kill 80% of the population.
[01:53:49.498 --> 01:54:02.104]  The Rosicrucians funded, of course, the stones, the standing stones that they have out in Georgia, outside Atlanta.
[01:54:06.119 --> 01:54:16.530]  And I have now been doing, off and on, well I've been doing many years of research on eugenics, but intensely, about six months of research.
[01:54:16.670 --> 01:54:20.554]  I got Aaron Dykes, who's done so much research on eugenics.
[01:54:20.594 --> 01:54:23.717]  He works in this office as a webmaster and video editor.
[01:54:24.238 --> 01:54:26.500]  I got Aaron in studio for an hour tomorrow.
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:28.262]  We're going to videotape it too and put it on the web.
[01:54:29.238 --> 01:54:34.443]  With literally thousands of pages of documents, there's no way for him to properly cover it.
[01:54:34.864 --> 01:54:37.246]  And there was no way for us to properly put it in in-game.
[01:54:37.286 --> 01:54:39.028]  It's like 15 minutes of the two-hour film.
[01:54:43.592 --> 01:54:47.456]  Where they openly say they're into the occult, and they openly say they want to kill us.
[01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:56.423]  And I mean, folks, I'm talking about HG Wells, I'm talking about the Huxleys, I'm talking about the Darwins, I'm talking about the Queen of England, I'm talking about all of them.
[01:54:56.523 --> 01:55:01.692]  I mean, Hitler, the Rockefellers funding Hitler, funding the eugenics societies,
[01:55:02.685 --> 01:55:04.247]  I know you guys are making seven of these.
[01:55:04.267 --> 01:55:09.434]  I don't know how far your research has gone, but have you nexused in yet in your research?
[01:55:09.454 --> 01:55:10.576]  Because you will run into this.
[01:55:11.437 --> 01:55:12.318]  I haven't asked you this.
[01:55:12.338 --> 01:55:13.199]  I'm not trying to put you on the spot.
[01:55:13.219 --> 01:55:14.140]  You probably know all about it, though.
[01:55:14.160 --> 01:55:15.442]  You're very well read and researched.
[01:55:15.963 --> 01:55:17.265]  And, of course, you know things I don't know.
[01:55:17.325 --> 01:55:18.066]  I know things you don't know.
[01:55:18.086 --> 01:55:18.907]  It's such a big subject.
[01:55:19.247 --> 01:55:36.216]  But have you run into yet the nexus with the fact that eugenics runs everything and that their physical formulation for the real world is a plan of eugenics and they are high priests who will have our blood flow for the gods?
[01:55:37.237 --> 01:55:38.037]  Have you found that yet?
[01:55:38.557 --> 01:55:47.542]  Yes, in fact, the major impetus towards eugenics is not surprisingly
[01:55:49.079 --> 01:55:59.204]  This global warming propaganda, because you see, Mother Earth is overwhelmed by and overburdened by our industrial civilization.
[01:55:59.625 --> 01:56:11.391]  We must destroy that industrial civilization, pare down the numbers of people by between 65 and 80 percent, and then force people to move to designated areas.
[01:56:11.671 --> 01:56:17.554]  And the United Nations has created a map for every country and continent in the world,
[01:56:18.109 --> 01:56:33.263]  Where they've designated certain living zones where humans will be forced to live only in these zones, and they will set aside up to 70% of the world's land
[01:56:40.768 --> 01:56:42.529]  And that is official!
[01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:50.555]  And see, the average person going, oh, I'm going to drive a Prius, I'm going to cut back on emissions, they don't know that carbon dioxide is a life-giving gas to plants.
[01:56:50.976 --> 01:56:51.816]  It's good for the Earth.
[01:56:51.856 --> 01:56:58.501]  Meanwhile, the globalists actually, genetic engineer, dump chemicals in the ocean, they do all the real things that hurt the Earth.
[01:56:58.521 --> 01:57:00.363]  That's what's so diabolical about them.
[01:57:01.331 --> 01:57:13.295]  But this, I mean, you've got to understand, global warming is going to prove to be a deadly, you know, or to have a deadly effect on... They've already said one child.
[01:57:13.335 --> 01:57:15.515]  They've already said one child in the U.S.
[01:57:15.555 --> 01:57:15.996]  and England.
[01:57:16.676 --> 01:57:17.456]  That's the whole plan.
[01:57:17.476 --> 01:57:18.276]  Stay there, David Bell.
[01:57:18.296 --> 01:57:19.056]  You're absolutely right.
[01:57:19.617 --> 01:57:21.537]  And you see, folks, I never talked to David about this.
[01:57:21.577 --> 01:57:23.018]  He hadn't made a film about this yet.
[01:57:23.498 --> 01:57:25.378]  And I bring it up to him and he knows all about it.
[01:57:25.438 --> 01:57:29.240]  And we can finish each other's sentences because we're covering the facts.
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:30.380]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.579 --> 01:57:37.863]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.386 --> 01:57:53.568]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.228 --> 01:57:55.028]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.809 --> 01:57:56.669]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.689 --> 01:58:00.991]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.531 --> 01:58:05.673]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.014 --> 01:58:11.875]  We are now back into our number three.
[01:58:14.676 --> 01:58:15.557]  We are joined by
[01:58:16.770 --> 01:58:19.652]  David Bay of Cutting Edge Ministry.
[01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:23.695]  We have links up to his site on InfoWars.com.
[01:58:24.376 --> 01:58:26.137]  And of course, the director of the film.
[01:58:26.157 --> 01:58:27.298]  They're making seven together.
[01:58:27.318 --> 01:58:28.899]  They've now completed their second.
[01:58:28.939 --> 01:58:29.540]  It's excellent.
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:31.761]  And that's Christian J. Pinto.
[01:58:31.781 --> 01:58:35.424]  The new film is Riddles in Stone, part two in the seven-part series.
[01:58:36.024 --> 01:58:38.466]  The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[01:58:38.927 --> 01:58:44.090]  Secret Mysteries of America's Beginnings, volume two, available right now at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:46.098 --> 01:59:10.241]  David Bay, at the end of the day, you run into a cultist that are obsessed with killing 80% of the population, setting up a world government neo-feudalism structure to do it, race-specific bio-weapons, but at the same time dumping 63 million gallons of nerve gas knowingly off the North Carolina coast into the ocean, doing everything they can to hurt the earth,
[01:59:11.230 --> 01:59:11.551]  I think so.
[01:59:26.787 --> 01:59:31.868]  And we see this, you know, in the occultism of Star Wars, of Darth Vader was to bring balance to the force.
[01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:35.069]  Isn't that a big Illuminati teaching, David Bay and Mr. Pinto?
[01:59:35.089 --> 01:59:35.930]  Yes, it is.
[01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:40.211]  In fact, it goes, you know, it goes a little bit wider than that.
[01:59:40.371 --> 01:59:45.652]  They actually call for the destruction of the old order before the new can be brought into place.
[01:59:46.412 --> 01:59:55.335]  And so, not only do they invent things, like global warming being so destructive, but they will actually
[01:59:55.851 --> 02:00:08.457]  They will actually pollute the water through the air themselves, and then call your attention to it and say that we need a dictatorship globally in order to deal with the problem that they've created.
[02:00:09.477 --> 02:00:17.761]  And it does fit in with, as you were saying earlier, Alex, with the occult doctrine as it's taught on the Georgia Guidestones.
[02:00:18.302 --> 02:00:21.143]  I've actually been to the Guidestones and filmed them several years ago.
[02:00:21.623 --> 02:00:24.945]  But it has the Guidestones, for those who don't know,
[02:00:25.765 --> 02:00:32.747]  have written in all these different languages the Ten Commandments of the whole New Age movement and the New Age philosophy.
[02:00:32.767 --> 02:00:37.528]  And they've got them written in different languages, in American, in Hebrew, in cuneiform.
[02:00:37.828 --> 02:00:40.149]  They've got them written in Chinese, Russian, and so on.
[02:00:40.769 --> 02:00:46.190]  And the first commandment is to maintain a world population below 500 million people.
[02:00:46.750 --> 02:00:50.711]  So, to maintain a world population below half a billion people.
[02:00:50.731 --> 02:00:52.592]  Now, we've got six billion people on the Earth,
[02:00:52.932 --> 02:00:53.775]  Six and a half, Bill.
[02:00:53.795 --> 02:00:54.418]  That's a 90% reduction.
[02:00:57.330 --> 02:00:57.870]  There you go.
[02:00:58.751 --> 02:01:09.837]  But it totally fits in if you study the monument was erected by some guy, an anonymous financier, who called himself R.C.
[02:01:09.897 --> 02:01:10.357]  Christian.
[02:01:10.397 --> 02:01:12.298]  That's the Rosicrucian reference there.
[02:01:12.318 --> 02:01:16.361]  To a secret trust under R.C.
[02:01:16.401 --> 02:01:21.163]  Christian, and they love the hidden in plain view that it says Rosicrucian.
[02:01:21.583 --> 02:01:21.784]  Right.
[02:01:21.844 --> 02:01:24.965]  And if you study Rosicrucianism, that's a very obvious reference.
[02:01:26.426 --> 02:01:27.908]  That's a frauder R.C.
[02:01:27.968 --> 02:01:35.196]  or a brother Rosicrucian or Christian Rosenkreuz who's sort of the mythical figure that allegedly founded the Rosicrucian Order.
[02:01:36.617 --> 02:01:41.082]  But then you read the writings of New Agers and Occultists, you read the book
[02:01:42.243 --> 02:01:45.085]  Oh, Reflections on the Christ, by David Spangler.
[02:01:45.645 --> 02:01:55.710]  And Spangler, who is a part of a United Nations group, an NGO group called, what is it, the United Earth for the World We Choose, or something like that.
[02:01:55.730 --> 02:02:00.892]  By the way, let me give you his quote about, no one will enter the New World Order unless they pledge themselves to Lucifer.
[02:02:01.453 --> 02:02:02.033]  Absolutely.
[02:02:02.814 --> 02:02:09.479]  And other New Agers talk about, they talk about how there is an inhumanity that there's a corrupt seed.
[02:02:09.979 --> 02:02:15.163]  And the corrupt seed are basically those who will not be initiated into Lucifer.
[02:02:16.243 --> 02:02:27.551]  And all the great pains of the world are caused because they aren't dead yet, so hence Antichrist must kill all the Christians and the Jews, or the great, because they're causing all the calamity.
[02:02:28.163 --> 02:02:31.246]  Just like the Aztecs had to kill another 10,000 or the sun wouldn't come back.
[02:02:31.686 --> 02:02:36.911]  No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer.
[02:02:37.391 --> 02:02:40.874]  No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation.
[02:02:41.295 --> 02:02:43.437]  Official UN publication, David Spangler.
[02:02:45.160 --> 02:02:45.880]  Terrorism!
[02:02:46.081 --> 02:02:46.801]  Terrorism!
[02:02:46.921 --> 02:02:53.005]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:02:53.245 --> 02:02:54.846]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:02:55.106 --> 02:02:57.567]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:02:57.947 --> 02:03:12.536]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:12.556 --> 02:03:12.896]  government.
[02:03:13.056 --> 02:03:14.877]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:03:15.237 --> 02:03:21.142]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:21.282 --> 02:03:25.766]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[02:03:47.646 --> 02:03:53.092]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:53.473 --> 02:04:01.101]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.795 --> 02:04:08.858]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.258 --> 02:04:20.663]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.983 --> 02:04:24.545]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.945 --> 02:04:26.906]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.206 --> 02:04:31.068]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.258 --> 02:04:48.820]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:52.162]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:04:52.482 --> 02:04:55.043]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:04:55.403 --> 02:05:00.225]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:05:00.605 --> 02:05:05.988]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:05:06.288 --> 02:05:09.249]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:05:09.429 --> 02:05:10.009]  We're good to go.

[02:05:49.739 --> 02:05:53.941]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:54.581 --> 02:05:55.402]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.162 --> 02:05:57.683]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.723 --> 02:06:01.705]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.905 --> 02:06:06.027]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.428 --> 02:06:13.771]  Well, we've got the director of Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C., on with us.
[02:06:14.812 --> 02:06:19.254]  It's a film you absolutely have got to have in your library to understand the overall
[02:06:20.143 --> 02:06:26.710]  Program, the agenda that we're living under and the people who are in control of our lives.
[02:06:28.371 --> 02:06:37.720]  From your research of the New World Order, David Bay and Christian Pinto, how do you see things breaking down the next year, two years, five years, ten years?
[02:06:38.381 --> 02:06:40.022]  How do you see things unfolding?
[02:06:40.063 --> 02:06:42.385]  How far along do the elite believe
[02:06:43.571 --> 02:06:55.480]  From their own occultic system, their own secular, separate from God view, how do they see things breaking down and shutting up?
[02:06:56.401 --> 02:07:09.650]  Well, the primary goal of the, or excuse me, the primary tool of the Illuminati to create this new world system is war and economic collapse.
[02:07:12.856 --> 02:07:20.961]  Albert Pike had a vision in 1870 which foresaw three world wars being necessary to produce their Masonic Christ in the world scene.
[02:07:21.401 --> 02:07:24.984]  The first two world wars have unfolded just as this vision foretold.
[02:07:25.564 --> 02:07:32.268]  The third world war, which was to produce the Masonic Christ, was to occur between Israel and her Arab neighbors.
[02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:39.513]  And that seems to be getting set in its final stages right before our eyes.
[02:07:40.073 --> 02:07:40.794]  So I think it's
[02:07:41.886 --> 02:07:42.868]  I think it's very close.
[02:07:48.969 --> 02:07:51.150]  to different British colleagues.
[02:07:51.190 --> 02:07:54.831]  These letters, of course, are there at the British Naval Museum.
[02:07:55.211 --> 02:07:58.573]  He did write about Lucifer seething in his hands.
[02:07:59.033 --> 02:08:02.514]  He did explain and talk about the porch masons.
[02:08:02.974 --> 02:08:12.558]  He also got into great detail about these three wars, and he described World War I, World War II, and then the final one being in the Middle East.
[02:08:12.658 --> 02:08:17.780]  I mean, this is not like Nostradamus was some vague, quatrain, pure baloney.
[02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:32.371]  I mean, what Albert Pike is writing and saying in the 1870s, founder of the Ku Klux Klan, supreme, you know, global head of the Masons, I mean, what this guy is saying in the 1870s, this is incredible!
[02:08:32.391 --> 02:08:42.719]  I mean, he had to have diabolical, you know, information from the other side, you know, kind of like the Fifth Element from Zorg or whoever.
[02:08:42.759 --> 02:08:45.761]  I mean, how do the secular people say he's doing this?
[02:08:47.048 --> 02:08:48.449]  Secular people don't want to talk about it.
[02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:54.392]  They just pass it off however they can.
[02:08:55.052 --> 02:08:55.972]  They can't deal with it.
[02:08:56.233 --> 02:09:00.615]  The fact of the matter is, all these men have a familiar spirit.
[02:09:01.395 --> 02:09:08.298]  In the practice of the occult, one of the first things you do is acquire or receive a familiar spirit.
[02:09:08.659 --> 02:09:10.439]  And this was a demonic vision.
[02:09:11.060 --> 02:09:13.401]  And the reason that it's coming to pass
[02:09:13.931 --> 02:09:19.677]  It's because this has been the plan of the Illuminati all during the 20th century, and including today.
[02:09:19.757 --> 02:09:21.899]  So it's also a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:09:21.919 --> 02:09:23.681]  They are literally manifesting it.
[02:09:24.322 --> 02:09:26.304]  Well, yeah, this is a blueprint.
[02:09:26.884 --> 02:09:29.547]  This is a blueprint for world leaders to follow.
[02:09:30.228 --> 02:09:36.351]  And after, you know, to them, you know, numbers are very important and they have great meaning.
[02:09:36.371 --> 02:09:39.552]  The number 11 is the number of the Masonic Christ.
[02:09:40.092 --> 02:09:54.118]  And just to make sure that the rest of the occult world knew the World War I had been completed according to Pike's plan, the Illuminati staged the final signing of the Armistice at the 11th hour of the 11th month.
[02:09:56.439 --> 02:09:57.539]  There's another 11 in there.
[02:09:57.959 --> 02:09:58.360]  11th hour, 11th month.
[02:09:59.935 --> 02:10:00.715]  Eleventh day.
[02:10:01.195 --> 02:10:02.876]  Eleventh day.
[02:10:02.916 --> 02:10:05.796]  There were three 11's there in the staging of that armament.
[02:10:06.016 --> 02:10:07.637]  And they believe they get power from this.
[02:10:07.677 --> 02:10:10.777]  Of course there were dozens and dozens of 11's on 9-11.
[02:10:11.197 --> 02:10:11.938]  Exactly.
[02:10:12.038 --> 02:10:13.578]  With different flight numbers and names.
[02:10:13.618 --> 02:10:14.078]  Then we have 3-11.
[02:10:14.258 --> 02:10:14.898]  We have 4-11.
[02:10:14.918 --> 02:10:15.918]  We have 7-7, 7-21.
[02:10:15.938 --> 02:10:17.879]  We have 7-7 with the thing in India.
[02:10:17.899 --> 02:10:18.799]  Now we've got 7-7-7 coming up.
[02:10:18.819 --> 02:10:19.699]  What is 7-7-7 to them?
[02:10:28.444 --> 02:10:37.935]  Well, 777 is a very important number in Aleister Crowley magic, in black magic for Aleister Crowley.
[02:10:38.575 --> 02:10:46.064]  It's a particular brand of magic that he created at the beginning of the 20th century, and to him it's a very big number, 777.
[02:10:48.795 --> 02:10:50.856]  Well, I wonder if we're going to see something happen.
[02:10:50.876 --> 02:11:00.058]  People are all waiting for 666, and I said, well, they usually don't do something that obvious, but I haven't seen them like to pass up two or three big dates in a row without pulling something.
[02:11:00.118 --> 02:11:06.921]  Explain to listeners why the globalists, why the Illuminati believe that they have to do things in accordance with numbers.
[02:11:07.721 --> 02:11:09.881]  Well, they believe that numbers contain inherent power.
[02:11:10.482 --> 02:11:17.504]  All pagans believe that, you know, all pagans worship the creature rather than the creator, and since God created numbers, then
[02:11:18.663 --> 02:11:21.609]  I was going to say, one of the things we talk about in Riddles in Stone is
[02:11:31.511 --> 02:11:46.222]  The tradition among Freemasons and Rosicrucians and really all the occult societies, they all take their tradition and their philosophy back to Pythagoras and Pythagorean geometry and Pythagorean numerology.
[02:11:46.282 --> 02:11:57.991]  Pythagoras is believed to be the first of the ancient philosophers to have ascribed a spiritual or inner meaning to numbers and so on, and also geometric shapes.
[02:11:58.411 --> 02:12:01.894]  And this is where, you know, the design and architecture of Washington, D.C.
[02:12:02.234 --> 02:12:10.982]  becomes very Pythagorean, once you understand the right triangle, a federal triangle, and then the inverted pentagram, and both of these were Pythagorean symbols.
[02:12:11.842 --> 02:12:24.313]  Adam Weisshaupt, who was the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati, when he wrote his final treatise describing the Illuminati plan for this world domination, he called his final treatise Pythagoras.
[02:12:25.013 --> 02:12:37.141]  And according to Dr. James Billington in his book, Fire in the Minds of Men, the revolutionaries from that era, through the 18th and 19th century especially, were heavily into Pythagorean philosophy.
[02:12:37.461 --> 02:12:48.008]  Now if listeners go up to InfoWars.com, in fact I want the network to do this, I forgot to tell the network to do this, because I want to play this coming up, they can click on Riddles in Stone, we have the front cover,
[02:12:48.985 --> 02:12:49.505]  I think so.
[02:13:05.186 --> 02:13:05.426]  We're good
[02:13:23.578 --> 02:13:24.278]  I don't
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:48.463]  Even Manly P. Hall and many other top masons wrote and said that you are porch masons.
[02:13:49.003 --> 02:13:51.344]  The fact is we've gone and gotten the Masonic writings.
[02:13:51.384 --> 02:13:52.765]  We've talked to master masons.
[02:13:52.805 --> 02:13:53.445]  We've talked to others.
[02:13:53.785 --> 02:13:56.226]  We know what is above the 33rd degree.
[02:13:56.246 --> 02:13:57.827]  You don't even know that there's something above that.
[02:13:58.207 --> 02:13:59.228]  You're being controlled.
[02:13:59.248 --> 02:14:01.048]  Can you explain compartmentalization to them?
[02:14:05.756 --> 02:14:11.281]  One of my favorite interviews in Riddles in Stone is with a guy named Dr. Robert Hieronymus.
[02:14:11.701 --> 02:14:15.284]  And Dr. Hieronymus, he's an author, he's a member of Co-Masonry.
[02:14:15.704 --> 02:14:21.689]  When we interviewed him, David and I both interviewed him, and he admitted that he had been a member of all kinds of secret societies.
[02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:27.214]  And he is close friends with S. Brent Morris, who is a 33rd degree Mason.
[02:14:27.774 --> 02:14:35.039]  Who is the managing editor for the Scottish Rite Journal right there inside the House of the Temple in Washington, D.C.
[02:14:35.339 --> 02:14:37.300]  And of course, we interviewed Dr. Morris as well.
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:52.149]  But anyway, Dr. Hieronymus, in his interview on camera, he admits that when you are a member of a secret society, and it's something that a lot of the Masonic philosophers have talked about, but a lot of modern Masons will deny it,
[02:14:52.709 --> 02:15:00.571]  But Hieronymus admits on camera that when you're a member of secret societies, that there are higher levels that you don't know anything about.
[02:15:00.931 --> 02:15:02.451]  And they don't tell you anything about them.
[02:15:02.491 --> 02:15:04.231]  You kind of stumble on them and so on.
[02:15:04.651 --> 02:15:22.035]  And at one point when he's describing, he's tracing it all back to ancient Egypt and the traditions of the Egyptian priests and so on, and how they would give false information one step at a time to those on the lower levels, and then they would reach higher levels and then gain greater understanding.
[02:15:22.595 --> 02:15:32.019]  And as he's talking about the deeper levels of understanding, he stops for a minute and he says, you know, if I'd have told you this 15 years ago, I might have gotten shot.
[02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:32.960]  Okay?
[02:15:33.000 --> 02:15:36.842]  And he says, but now, thankfully, today, I can be a lot more open about it.
[02:15:37.222 --> 02:15:41.344]  And the reason is because there's a movement in masonry and the secret orders.
[02:15:42.084 --> 02:15:45.605]  And I stumbled across this when I was at PRS, the Philosophic Research Society.
[02:15:45.625 --> 02:15:51.128]  No, they believe they're now taking over, so now it's time to have it be mass-manifest.
[02:15:51.468 --> 02:15:52.309]  Right, exactly.
[02:15:52.329 --> 02:15:57.434]  They believe that the time for secrecy has passed and now they need to reveal to the world what they're doing.
[02:15:58.081 --> 02:15:59.442]  And do it one step at a time.
[02:16:00.003 --> 02:16:00.963]  And they've admitted this.
[02:16:01.023 --> 02:16:05.067]  In fact, there's a guy, Buff Perry, that we interview, who's a professional cypher.
[02:16:05.327 --> 02:16:07.288]  And he deals with these guys all the time.
[02:16:07.328 --> 02:16:10.191]  He's not a mason, but he researches with them.
[02:16:10.591 --> 02:16:26.063]  And he admits, in one of his interviews, that the Illuminati, as he calls them, are slowly, one step at a time, revealing things about themselves to the rest of the world, so they can understand the history of the last several hundred years in Western culture.
[02:16:27.225 --> 02:16:32.146]  Which is exactly what we do in our two videos, The New Atlantis and Riddles in Stone.
[02:16:32.966 --> 02:16:33.807]  We reveal that history.
[02:16:33.827 --> 02:16:36.987]  But you know, it goes beyond this.
[02:16:37.007 --> 02:16:43.169]  It goes to the structuring, the creation of an invisible society.
[02:16:43.829 --> 02:16:45.049]  An invisible lodge.
[02:16:45.129 --> 02:16:48.550]  Manly P. Hall said this, that there are two kinds of lodges.
[02:16:48.570 --> 02:16:51.471]  There's the visible lodge, and there's the invisible lodge.
[02:16:52.011 --> 02:16:54.512]  And at any one point in time,
[02:16:55.836 --> 02:17:00.717]  The Visible Lodge will comprise about 95% of all Masons.
[02:17:01.417 --> 02:17:06.038]  Only about 5% comprise the Invisible Lodge.
[02:17:06.438 --> 02:17:12.459]  But the purpose of the Visible Lodge is to hide the very existence of the Invisible Lodge.
[02:17:13.100 --> 02:17:23.522]  And so these guys that you mentioned, Alex, that go down to the Lodge and eat pizza and then go to church on Sunday, they're members of the Visible Lodge.
[02:17:24.082 --> 02:17:24.982]  They have no idea.
[02:17:27.640 --> 02:17:31.143]  Absolutely, and I want them to know that we know that they're not bad people.
[02:17:31.183 --> 02:17:36.988]  They've just been deceived because... We'll be right back to discuss it more on the other side with our guest.
[02:17:37.328 --> 02:17:38.669]  The film is Riddles in Stone.

[02:17:44.884 --> 02:17:49.848]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegels, a Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis After Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.

[02:18:26.527 --> 02:18:27.047]  I think so.
[02:18:45.012 --> 02:18:48.913]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:18:49.133 --> 02:19:01.416]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:19:01.836 --> 02:19:02.236]  The U.S.
[02:19:02.296 --> 02:19:07.878]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:19:08.258 --> 02:19:10.459]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:19:12.339 --> 02:19:13.401]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:19:13.441 --> 02:19:16.284]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:19:16.404 --> 02:19:22.451]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[02:22:42.159 --> 02:22:45.700]  Also, we restream the show 21 hours a day.
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:49.421]  We're live 11 to 2, and then consecutively after that we continue to re-air it.
[02:22:50.001 --> 02:22:54.362]  Also, help us get the word out about stations that carry this show on the AM or FM dial.
[02:22:55.742 --> 02:22:57.923]  We really appreciate our AM and FM affiliates.
[02:22:57.963 --> 02:22:59.823]  You can also tell folks how they can always listen
[02:23:00.564 --> 02:23:01.305]  It was me, David Bay.
[02:23:23.476 --> 02:23:40.628]  Well, I was saying that the poor average Mason, even though he may be a 32nd, 33rd degree Mason, has no idea that an invisible lodge even exists.
[02:23:41.188 --> 02:23:48.694]  So he can stand there with all of the righteous indignation that he can muster and say, you know, I have been a Mason all my life.
[02:23:48.774 --> 02:23:50.035]  I'm a 33rd degree Mason.
[02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:51.896]  None of this stuff goes on here.
[02:23:52.432 --> 02:23:53.573]  He's absolutely correct.
[02:23:53.974 --> 02:24:02.461]  It is the invisible Lodge that is truly Luciferian and does all of the things that we're talking about.
[02:24:02.681 --> 02:24:06.785]  Now they don't even know either that there's 360 degrees.
[02:24:06.845 --> 02:24:14.672]  Now most of those have angels and gods and principalities on that line, but humans can go up even higher than the 33rd degree.
[02:24:15.633 --> 02:24:15.813]  Right.
[02:24:16.710 --> 02:24:29.279]  During the time of the French mason Mazzini and Albert Pike, they collaborated to produce all of these extra degrees up to that level.
[02:24:30.380 --> 02:24:37.065]  And in fact, Mazzini said, he said, we must keep it absolutely secret within our lodge.
[02:24:37.105 --> 02:24:40.908]  He said, he said, our secrecy will give us power.
[02:24:41.489 --> 02:24:45.992]  And so they kept it very secret, especially from the average visible mason.
[02:24:47.763 --> 02:24:59.969]  The apologetics that they use to defend it, because there are some that are more widely published, like Alistair Crowley was initiated into the 90th degree, which is called the right of misrem, and so on.
[02:25:01.270 --> 02:25:08.854]  And what they argue, in defense of those things, is they argue that that is not a part of official
[02:25:09.614 --> 02:25:15.280]  Craft masonry, that that's not officially acknowledged by the Grand Lodge of England.
[02:25:16.080 --> 02:25:23.708]  Now what's very interesting is that the pro-Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of England is a guy named the Marquis de Northampton.
[02:25:24.188 --> 02:25:31.776]  And if you go online and you read up on Northampton, you find that one of his favorite hobbies as a mason
[02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:32.917]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:25:53.411 --> 02:25:59.635]  Of how all of the official lodges throughout the world ultimately owe their allegiance to the Grand Lodge of England.
[02:26:00.016 --> 02:26:02.898]  And the head of the Grand Lodge is the Marquis de Northampton.
[02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:11.303]  In a nutshell, what will the world look like if the forces of Luciferianism prevail?
[02:26:11.484 --> 02:26:13.125]  How would they rot?
[02:26:13.205 --> 02:26:13.965]  What would they build?
[02:26:15.606 --> 02:26:20.730]  Well, I believe what they're trying to do is they are trying to build paradise on Earth.
[02:26:21.793 --> 02:26:23.413]  But it's their version of paradise.
[02:26:23.493 --> 02:26:26.074]  Hitler was trying to build paradise on earth.
[02:26:26.734 --> 02:26:29.534]  But one man's paradise is another man's perdition.
[02:26:29.734 --> 02:26:41.136]  It was Hitler's idea of paradise that it's going to be this Aryan wonderland where all the people that he likes and approves of and who thinks the way that he does are going to have a glorious, wonderful existence.
[02:26:41.497 --> 02:26:49.438]  Unfortunately, it's going to be hell on earth for the Jews and the Gypsies and people who fall outside his paradigm of understanding.
[02:26:50.298 --> 02:26:57.660]  And that's the problem, but if you study what these guys are doing, you go and read the writings of Peter Dawkins.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:01.380]  He's got a book, and he's close to the Marquis de Northampton.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:02.381]  He's a good friend of his.
[02:27:02.841 --> 02:27:12.703]  He's got a book called Building Paradise, the Freemasonic and Rosicrucian Six Days Work, and they believe that they're building a global utopia.
[02:27:13.323 --> 02:27:15.583]  Let's end the show at the start.
[02:27:15.963 --> 02:27:18.184]  Let's go back in the next segment to
[02:27:19.378 --> 02:27:34.089]  The Mystery Religion is where they come from and basically plot them through the Knights Templars and the Rosicrucians and the different orders of masonry from... We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.450 --> 02:27:36.411]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.431 --> 02:27:38.492]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.552 --> 02:27:42.055]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.959 --> 02:27:49.042]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[02:28:48.229 --> 02:28:53.353]  Did you know that every original document on the federal and state level proves America is a Christian nation?
[02:28:53.953 --> 02:28:57.516]  Did you know that the Supreme Court has undermined our religious heritage?

[02:29:18.270 --> 02:29:26.396]  Did you know that over 700 suitcase bombs were smuggled out of Russia and are in the hands of radicals bent upon America's destruction?

[02:29:45.882 --> 02:29:56.887]  JLS Research, the makers of all-natural and very effective no-BO deodorant, has now discovered very unique research that indicates those who have body odor may be deficient in a certain dietary component.
[02:29:57.087 --> 02:30:03.370]  Their new product, the First Responder, supplies the body with the missing link so that it can respond to the symptom called body odor.
[02:30:03.390 --> 02:30:03.850]  I think so.
[02:30:22.376 --> 02:30:26.880]  It's so effective you need only one organic capsule per day to keep the odor away.
[02:30:27.160 --> 02:30:29.642]  First Responder is 100% guaranteed.
[02:30:29.962 --> 02:30:33.465]  Go online and order First Responder at no-bo.com.
[02:30:33.665 --> 02:30:37.028]  Visit no-bo.com or call JLS Research at 850-723-8599.
[02:30:37.048 --> 02:30:37.248]  That's 850-723-8599.
[02:30:45.097 --> 02:30:55.980]  You know, when a black leader like Khalid Mohammed, who I'm going to play some clips of tomorrow if we have time, says, kill all the whites because they're the devil,
[02:31:05.359 --> 02:31:06.320]  There's really no difference.
[02:31:06.640 --> 02:31:10.784]  That's what the whites would say when they were running slavery was, oh, blacks are devils.
[02:31:10.844 --> 02:31:11.705]  They're not humans.
[02:31:12.205 --> 02:31:15.228]  And they would misinterpret the Bible and claim things like that.
[02:31:16.269 --> 02:31:20.412]  But that's really the Illuminati's religion, that one group's elitist, the other group isn't.
[02:31:20.592 --> 02:31:23.735]  One group is made to rule, the others are meant to serve.
[02:31:24.816 --> 02:31:26.878]  And it's all extremely dangerous.
[02:31:26.938 --> 02:31:29.200]  And now it seems like the world is just broken up into
[02:31:29.975 --> 02:31:34.138]  You know, 15, 20 different brands of people saying they're the elite group.
[02:31:34.719 --> 02:31:40.283]  I just want everybody to live in peace and be free, and I love everybody's children, regardless of what color they are.
[02:31:40.343 --> 02:31:46.287]  And if we're going to beat this New World Order, A, we're going to need God's help, and B, we're going to need to know who our enemies are.
[02:31:47.208 --> 02:31:53.652]  And that's what you learn with a film like Riddles in Stone, The Secret Architecture of Washington, D.C.
[02:31:53.672 --> 02:31:55.413]  I mean, this is a historical fact.
[02:31:55.433 --> 02:31:58.876]  This is not debatable, but the average person isn't even aware of it.
[02:32:00.111 --> 02:32:04.154]  Let's go ahead and play the trailer to their film, Riddles and Stone.
[02:32:04.174 --> 02:32:09.538]  I'm going to play a little clip from a History Channel piece on the Hellfire Club.
[02:32:12.340 --> 02:32:15.763]  We have a unique nation, a republic, like no others.
[02:32:17.324 --> 02:32:18.945]  And so this must be unique.
[02:32:20.667 --> 02:32:22.248]  This will be our nation's capital.
[02:32:49.019 --> 02:32:55.147]  Clearly a lot of the designers and architects of Washington D.C.
[02:32:55.768 --> 02:33:00.554]  were masons, starting with George Washington himself, who was a guiding force.
[02:33:01.753 --> 02:33:07.198]  I do not believe that there are any secret plans or designs related to Freemasonry.
[02:33:07.538 --> 02:33:10.801]  Well, it was definitely designed according to Masonic principles.
[02:33:10.901 --> 02:33:12.242]  The streets are laid out that way.
[02:33:12.543 --> 02:33:14.004]  The buildings are laid out that way.
[02:33:14.464 --> 02:33:20.810]  Conspiracists are always looking under their bed for evidence that there is some vast conspiracy.
[02:33:21.070 --> 02:33:25.654]  Masons may very well say that they really aren't influential as far as Washington, D.C.
[02:33:25.734 --> 02:33:28.537]  is concerned, and yet the cornerstone was laid by Masons.
[02:33:29.818 --> 02:33:36.367]  You see that the inverted five-pointed star which is the Goat of Mindy's built into the streets of Washington DC.
[02:33:36.467 --> 02:33:40.291]  No, there are no satanic plans in the street plans of Washington DC.
[02:33:40.452 --> 02:33:40.812]  There is a
[02:33:42.085 --> 02:33:44.648]  Pentagram to the north of the White House.
[02:33:44.708 --> 02:33:47.852]  But the streets don't actually connect to form a pentagram.
[02:33:47.952 --> 02:33:48.853]  This is geometry.
[02:33:49.473 --> 02:33:49.974]  It happens.
[02:33:49.994 --> 02:33:52.216]  No one could have that happen accidentally.
[02:33:52.296 --> 02:33:56.241]  The anti-masons want to show that there is some demonic conspiracy.
[02:33:56.381 --> 02:33:57.362]  It's bell worship.
[02:33:57.582 --> 02:33:58.603]  That's what you're involved in.
[02:33:58.944 --> 02:34:00.766]  That is what masonry is based upon.
[02:34:00.826 --> 02:34:01.847]  The power of the dragon.
[02:34:02.027 --> 02:34:02.468]  In a word,
[02:34:03.129 --> 02:34:03.629]  Hogwash.
[02:34:03.649 --> 02:34:08.072]  When you want to talk about symbols and what they mean, you really have to look at who's authored these symbols.
[02:34:08.232 --> 02:34:10.194]  With symbols, there are always multiple levels.
[02:34:10.274 --> 02:34:12.015]  Symbols reveal and they conceal.
[02:34:12.936 --> 02:34:15.137]  And that's why they're used and that's why they're so important.
[02:34:15.497 --> 02:34:20.281]  They reveal to those who have eyes to see and ears to hear.
[02:34:21.741 --> 02:34:24.623]  If I would have told you this 15 years ago, I might have gotten shot.
[02:34:24.844 --> 02:34:26.785]  When they're shooting at you, you know they're serious.
[02:34:37.663 --> 02:34:38.404]  Alright, folks.
[02:34:39.605 --> 02:34:45.810]  Now, take the Parliament in Canada and Ottawa.
[02:34:47.852 --> 02:34:51.755]  They admit it is built as a Neo-Masonic temple.
[02:34:51.895 --> 02:34:53.737]  They admit that the rooms are calculated to 666.
[02:34:54.578 --> 02:34:56.379]  That's in mainstream newspapers.
[02:34:57.040 --> 02:34:59.322]  There's gargoyles and demons all over it.
[02:35:00.074 --> 02:35:02.635]  And then they tell us, just, oh, that's not what it's all about.
[02:35:02.795 --> 02:35:11.120]  But it's admitted in mainstream history that they did engage in rituals in England as part of the Hellfire Club and other clubs.
[02:35:11.980 --> 02:35:17.243]  And, of course, the British intelligence agent, who was really an agent the whole time, Benjamin Franklin, who ended up dying in England.
[02:35:17.983 --> 02:35:20.684]  Of course, you know him as the ambassador to the French court and the rest of it.
[02:35:21.425 --> 02:35:23.606]  This is what the History Channel had to say about him.
[02:35:24.945 --> 02:35:31.368]  America was born in rebellion, and a few of its greatest icons made alliances with the host of hell.
[02:35:35.230 --> 02:35:48.336]  In the late 1700s, a group of Englishmen formed the first Hellfire Club, a fraternity dedicated to drinking, sex, and at times, ridiculing Christianity and marking its sacred rituals.
[02:35:49.722 --> 02:35:54.486]  Members met at ruined monasteries to revel in black masses and drunken orgies.
[02:35:55.467 --> 02:36:01.472]  An occasional participant was the American ambassador to Great Britain, Benjamin Franklin.
[02:36:03.374 --> 02:36:14.484]  Now, when this is part of history, how did the people you... I mean, I know I've seen it, but I mean, even behind the scenes, how did these top masons respond when you guys were throwing this in their face?
[02:36:16.795 --> 02:36:25.176]  Well, they weren't, uh, they weren't, uh, you know, when, when, when, when I interviewed them in person
[02:36:25.851 --> 02:36:42.539]  I let him see the questions in advance, and the two full-on masons that we interview, Brent Morris, who's the managing editor for the Scottish Rite Journal, and then Trevor McEwen, who is the grant historian for the Grand Lodge in British Columbia.
[02:36:43.439 --> 02:36:47.581]  I let him see the questions in advance, but they were questions about
[02:36:48.487 --> 02:36:50.968]  The various theories that come against masonry.
[02:36:51.408 --> 02:36:55.049]  And I was determined when I interviewed them because I really wanted to know what they thought.
[02:36:55.589 --> 02:37:00.770]  Not to attack them in the interview, but just to let them talk and let them explain their views.
[02:37:01.610 --> 02:37:13.353]  But since they've seen the documentary, Trevor McEwan actually has published an article on his Colombian website, really, you know, denouncing Riddles in Stone completely.
[02:37:13.373 --> 02:37:17.854]  And he's actually publishing a number of things about it that are just outright false.
[02:37:18.414 --> 02:37:19.955]  Yeah, they're not happy with it.
[02:37:21.296 --> 02:37:28.282]  You know, I sent them copies of the film when it was finished, but Trevor McKeown was the only one who contacted me as a result.
[02:37:29.163 --> 02:37:34.687]  The other Masons have just really sort of retreated and had nothing to say about it.
[02:37:35.308 --> 02:37:39.211]  You know, it's part of the record that Masons engage in a lot of murders in this country.
[02:37:40.087 --> 02:37:46.793]  And that's why it ended up, you know, it was actually outlawed for a short time here and they were being hunted down.
[02:37:47.494 --> 02:37:51.437]  But you tell the average person that they don't even have the time to look in an encyclopedia to learn it.
[02:37:51.717 --> 02:37:52.238]  David Bay?
[02:37:52.938 --> 02:38:00.885]  Yes, I felt, you know, and I discussed this with Chris before we started the first volume, The New Atlantis.
[02:38:01.406 --> 02:38:06.550]  I felt that Freemasonry is an indefensible system.
[02:38:07.262 --> 02:38:16.149]  If you know their writings, and you know their belief, and you can quote them, what they say and what they do is just indefensible.
[02:38:16.469 --> 02:38:28.838]  I mean, when Manly P. Hall says that when a master mason learns the secret of his craft, the seeding energies of Lucifer are in his hands, that's indefensible.
[02:38:29.458 --> 02:38:34.162]  And so what we wanted to do, and we boldly did it in both Volume 1 and Volume 2, both
[02:38:34.810 --> 02:38:36.491]  Both in New Atlantis and Riddles in Stone.
[02:38:36.872 --> 02:38:38.193]  We let the Masons talk!
[02:38:38.773 --> 02:38:46.280]  And then we let the Masonic Critics talk!
[02:38:46.300 --> 02:38:54.667]  And you can see how indefensible Freemasonry is when you get this give and play between these two groups.
[02:38:56.864 --> 02:39:02.393]  Well, it's what really governs our society and people should start becoming more honest about it.
[02:39:02.413 --> 02:39:09.685]  I'm just so tired of seeing the general public go through life like zombies, never even looking around them and finding out this literal matrix.
[02:39:09.705 --> 02:39:10.426]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:39:11.500 --> 02:39:30.253]  No, I was just going to say, you know, just as David said, you know, I find when I do interviews with people, you know, if we're not attacking them, if we're not attacking what they believe, but just inquiring in a, you know, documentary journalist manner, they tend to open up, and we do.
[02:39:30.313 --> 02:39:31.394]  We really let them
[02:39:32.174 --> 02:39:33.775]  Let them talk in Riddles and Stones.
[02:39:33.795 --> 02:39:55.983]  It's a three-hour documentary, and you hear from, you know, master masons, you hear from a 33rd degree mason, you hear from a guy, Dr. Obadiah Harris, who's the president of the Philosophical Research Society that was founded by Manley P. Hall, the man considered to be masonry's greatest philosopher, and these guys sit and they talk at great length.
[02:39:56.763 --> 02:40:01.005]  About the philosophies of masonry and really all the secret societies.
[02:40:01.365 --> 02:40:04.266]  But you hear from their own mouths what they really believe.
[02:40:04.286 --> 02:40:04.726]  Here's another point.
[02:40:05.006 --> 02:40:11.529]  What they claim on the surface too about brotherhood of man and liberty and freedom and fighting tyranny, they could say some of that was done in 1776.
[02:40:12.569 --> 02:40:24.174]  Certainly in the French Revolution we see the more Luciferian manifestation and the mass killing and millions killed and extermination in nine-day weeks and changing the calendars and just all this occultism.
[02:40:25.888 --> 02:40:28.590]  But look at the Masonic leaders today.
[02:40:28.631 --> 02:40:30.352]  They're setting up tyranny.
[02:40:30.392 --> 02:40:32.073]  They're destroying freedom.
[02:40:32.134 --> 02:40:35.316]  They're doing the opposite of what they publicly claim.
[02:40:35.436 --> 02:40:39.560]  And all over England, it's big news how Masons can't be convicted of murders.
[02:40:40.080 --> 02:40:43.904]  And they're above the law, and every judge is a Mason, and they're ruling everyone.
[02:40:43.944 --> 02:40:47.607]  I mean, just secularly, on its face, it's a mafia.
[02:40:48.208 --> 02:40:52.850]  Well, you see, masons have always redefined terms, and people don't understand that.
[02:40:53.151 --> 02:41:07.118]  I mean, when they say liberty, and that's one of their great terms, that they want liberty, it doesn't mean freedom from tyranny, it means freedom from all restrictions on their behavior.
[02:41:08.129 --> 02:41:09.992]  That means their freedom!
[02:41:10.172 --> 02:41:11.734]  Their freedom to kill whoever they want!
[02:41:12.175 --> 02:41:12.735]  Exactly!
[02:41:13.136 --> 02:41:13.657]  Exactly!
[02:41:14.177 --> 02:41:18.243]  And so, just like the communists, these guys have redefined the terms!
[02:41:18.663 --> 02:41:21.928]  And if you don't understand they've redefined them, you're gonna be deceived every time!
[02:41:23.266 --> 02:41:37.857]  Yeah, this is what happened back in 1826, and we talk about this in Secret Mysteries 1, with the whole Captain William Morgan affair, which is something that has been practically removed entirely from modern history books, and it's something that everybody should know about.
[02:41:39.118 --> 02:41:48.765]  There's even a monument up there in Batavia, New York, that the people erected, and they go out of their way to let you know that they've kept in the Hall of Records
[02:41:49.298 --> 02:42:01.687]  What went on with Captain Morgan, how he was kidnapped and murdered by these masons, and then afterwards, as Charles Finney records in his book, when they tried to prosecute these guys, they couldn't prosecute them.
[02:42:01.727 --> 02:42:10.334]  Because there were judges, there were sheriffs, all the people in key positions of power were members of the Masonic Order, and they were protecting their own kind.
[02:42:10.614 --> 02:42:14.737]  This goes back to, you know, shortly after the American Revolution, this was going on.
[02:42:15.177 --> 02:42:17.139]  And there was a huge outcry in our country.
[02:42:17.179 --> 02:42:21.302]  The first third party in American politics was the anti-Mason party.
[02:42:21.802 --> 02:42:27.487]  And it was specifically brought about to withstand Masonry.
[02:42:27.567 --> 02:42:28.167]  Absolutely.
[02:42:28.207 --> 02:42:32.891]  In a nutshell, and both the films are excellent, the two volumes are all available.
[02:42:33.351 --> 02:42:37.352]  At InfoWars.com, listeners are 888-253-3139.
[02:42:37.392 --> 02:42:45.135]  Just in a nutshell, both of you, sum it up, the history, where these mystery religions come from, and the chain of events to the present.
[02:42:47.455 --> 02:42:55.198]  Well, the mystery religions, from the research I've done, according to the occultists, begins in ancient Atlantis.
[02:42:56.065 --> 02:42:59.967]  Uh, that Enoch was supposedly the first great king of Atlantis.
[02:42:59.987 --> 02:43:02.048]  He was the first initiator of the mysteries.
[02:43:02.348 --> 02:43:14.834]  This is why the new Atlantis is so important, and the vision of America as Atlantis resurrected, if you will, becomes a key point, because what they believe they're doing is resurrecting
[02:43:15.254 --> 02:43:20.277]  Through the ancient mysteries, the ancient philosophy of Atlantis, they are going to build this philosophic empire.
[02:43:20.357 --> 02:43:21.738]  And they do have ancient history.
[02:43:21.778 --> 02:43:23.779]  It's now been admitted, but it's kept very quiet.
[02:43:24.399 --> 02:43:27.681]  They've dug up skeletons at least 6,000 years old.
[02:43:28.101 --> 02:43:33.704]  Plus, in the New World, that are Nordic, we know that there was mining operations.
[02:43:34.004 --> 02:43:39.767]  So this really does show, though I don't particularly agree with their history of how Atlantis worked, but that there was an older trading system.
[02:43:39.948 --> 02:43:40.608]  Do you agree with that?
[02:43:41.268 --> 02:43:57.575]  Oh yeah, we talk about the book America, B.C., where Barry Fell, Harvard professor, spent most of his life researching the archaeological evidence on the eastern seaboard, that the ancient world did have knowledge of the American continent.
[02:43:57.875 --> 02:44:02.837]  And this is what is believed by all of these chief philosophers and these occult societies.
[02:44:03.217 --> 02:44:05.258]  Sure, so they really do have the secret knowledge.
[02:44:05.978 --> 02:44:07.219]  Yeah, they really do.
[02:44:07.459 --> 02:44:08.780]  Yeah, it would seem that way.
[02:44:09.661 --> 02:44:12.242]  Their guiding spirits give it to them.
[02:44:12.943 --> 02:44:17.546]  So they do have knowledge that the rest of society does not have.
[02:44:18.386 --> 02:44:19.167]  Please continue.
[02:44:20.568 --> 02:44:34.957]  Well, from ancient Atlantis, the thread is picked up through ancient Babylon, and its ancient mysteries, and then flows to ancient Egypt, and then to the Middle Eastern religions, like the Chaldeans,
[02:44:35.961 --> 02:44:38.242]  That's where the god Baal comes from.
[02:44:38.262 --> 02:44:49.383]  And of course, as we show on Riddles in Stone, images and symbols of Baal are quite numerous in our nation's capital, if you know just what to look for.
[02:44:51.424 --> 02:44:59.945]  And Freemasonry itself, to get to modern masonry, it flows through the 9th Templar.
[02:45:00.465 --> 02:45:02.366]  So you've got quite a thread from Atlantis
[02:45:04.181 --> 02:45:12.721]  To Babylon, to Egypt, to the Middle Eastern mystery religions, then through the Knights Templar, and then through modern masonry.
[02:45:13.908 --> 02:45:16.549]  Yeah, the Knights Templar, I think, are a real linchpin.
[02:45:16.889 --> 02:45:32.033]  And the fact that Columbus, who was married to a woman whose family came from a long line of Knight Templars, and when Columbus came over with his ships, his ships bore the standard, you know, the red cross and a white background, which was the symbol of the Templars.
[02:45:32.534 --> 02:45:40.416]  And while there's a certain amount of mystery to that, there are those in, you know, some researchers believe that Columbus had been given
[02:45:41.187 --> 02:45:44.368]  Some kind of maps or some kind of, you know, guidance.
[02:45:44.588 --> 02:45:51.930]  Well, it's also known that the Templars got so much power in, not just in armies, but in shipping, because they had hidden knowledge on rudders.
[02:45:52.010 --> 02:45:55.411]  And rudders were the little files they had in Spain.
[02:45:55.431 --> 02:45:57.671]  And, of course, the Portuguese rudders were the best.
[02:45:57.931 --> 02:46:01.352]  That does go back to the Templars on the different navigable waters.
[02:46:01.412 --> 02:46:05.053]  So, again, it all goes back to these were private, secret intelligence agencies.
[02:46:06.212 --> 02:46:24.279]  Absolutely, and the secret societies, especially in Western culture, and we talk about this in Part 1, really form the foundation of the Western intelligence community, starting during the time of Queen Elizabeth, but it would have even preceded that, if you go back to the Templars.
[02:46:25.139 --> 02:46:28.841]  But the intelligence community that formed with the Rosicrucians in England,
[02:46:29.381 --> 02:46:52.262]  To protect Queen Elizabeth from being assassinated, that was then brought to America, and you find a lot of the same elements, because Sir Francis Bacon was like one of the chief guys along with Dr. John Dee, the original Agent 007, who was working to protect with secret codes and ciphers and all this other kind of stuff, to run an intelligence network there in England.
[02:46:52.482 --> 02:46:53.884]  Absolutely, we're out of time!
[02:46:54.584 --> 02:46:58.165]  Gentlemen, I want to get you back up again to take calls in the next few months.
[02:46:58.465 --> 02:47:01.526]  Had it up for two hours just to take calls from the audience.
[02:47:01.606 --> 02:47:02.847]  All of us putting our heads together.
[02:47:02.887 --> 02:47:04.247]  All the research is just amazing.
[02:47:04.747 --> 02:47:06.368]  Littles in stone, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:47:06.388 --> 02:47:07.628]  You absolutely need to get it.
[02:47:07.648 --> 02:47:09.128]  You need to get the first volume as well.
[02:47:09.409 --> 02:47:13.630]  This is the second volume available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:47:17.991 --> 02:47:22.736]  And Christian J. Pinto, the award-winning director, and of course the producer, David Bay.
[02:47:22.796 --> 02:47:24.297]  Gentlemen, I want to thank you for coming on with us.
[02:47:24.738 --> 02:47:25.458]  Thank you, Howard.
[02:47:26.039 --> 02:47:26.539]  God bless you.
[02:47:26.579 --> 02:47:28.421]  Great men there, and we are so honored to have them.
[02:47:28.902 --> 02:47:30.904]  I was just given some absolutely horrible news.
[02:47:31.224 --> 02:47:33.566]  I've got Luke Rudowsky waiting on hold.
[02:47:33.606 --> 02:47:41.634]  I wanted to get him to pop in to tell us about the demonstration against the attack on free speech in New York to ban videotaping and photography by the citizenry.
[02:47:43.328 --> 02:47:49.612]  And I tell you how all the time we get sent law enforcement magazines, internal law enforcement documents, law enforcement CDs.
[02:47:50.492 --> 02:47:58.697]  I just got an internal new federally issued law enforcement training manual I've been reading over in the last segment while our guests have been speaking.
[02:48:00.158 --> 02:48:07.682]  This is the Operational WMD Response for Law Enforcement Participant Manual, Homeland Security, and I just read High Treason.
[02:48:08.643 --> 02:48:10.184]  They just opened this an hour ago.
[02:48:10.224 --> 02:48:12.085]  They've been scanning and they've already found it's
[02:48:13.877 --> 02:48:14.957]  How many pages is this?
[02:48:15.418 --> 02:48:17.198]  This thing's as big as a Dallas phone book.
[02:48:18.139 --> 02:48:25.041]  I just really found some bad stuff in here, and it actually made my heart patter a bit, which is hard to do.
[02:48:25.061 --> 02:48:27.622]  A little bit of pattering that went on.
[02:48:29.383 --> 02:48:30.543]  I just wish it wasn't true.
[02:48:30.763 --> 02:48:31.263]  Oh, God.
[02:48:31.283 --> 02:48:34.384]  Oh, we're in trouble.
[02:48:34.865 --> 02:48:36.225]  This country's so far gone.
[02:48:36.605 --> 02:48:41.047]  You want to read high treason by the government, you want to know who the real terrorists are, it's right here.
[02:48:41.067 --> 02:48:41.527]  Stay with us.
[02:48:48.584 --> 02:48:54.028]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.408 --> 02:49:02.053]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.

[02:51:00.108 --> 02:51:04.889]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.

[02:52:09.037 --> 02:52:16.682]  This is the NCBRT 2004 Part Version 1.5 Law Enforcement Sensitive.
[02:52:17.423 --> 02:52:21.406]  Well, it's going to be real sensitive when this is all scanned in and put on the web in the next few hours.
[02:52:22.057 --> 02:52:28.840]  I'm going to have a special video report out on this and a blurb report up on JonesReport.com that I want dug to the top.
[02:52:28.940 --> 02:52:30.060]  I want everybody to see this.
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:32.761]  This is the worst manual I've ever seen.
[02:52:33.701 --> 02:52:40.744]  You think them saying gun owners are terrorists and Christians are terrorists and you know all those other little manuals you've seen?
[02:52:40.804 --> 02:52:41.944]  This is worse, okay?
[02:52:43.405 --> 02:52:46.986]  We've just started reading it and just opened it and everything is pure evil.
[02:52:47.667 --> 02:52:51.108]  It says you are terrorist if you believe in a New World Order conspiracy.
[02:52:52.418 --> 02:52:52.539]  Okay?
[02:52:54.004 --> 02:52:55.369]  And it says, you are terrorists.
[02:52:56.171 --> 02:52:58.419]  You are, it says, we are the most dangerous.
[02:52:59.125 --> 02:53:03.970]  Because we talk about the real world, and then... Let me go to Luke Radowsky, and we only got a few minutes left here.
[02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:08.955]  Look, I gotta get you up for longer in the next few days, and we are Change.org, just on fire with your work.
[02:53:09.215 --> 02:53:12.258]  First off, they're trying to ban photography and videoing anywhere in the city.
[02:53:12.519 --> 02:53:14.601]  You guys went and protested Bloomberg Monday.
[02:53:14.861 --> 02:53:16.803]  What happened there, and then what happened yesterday?
[02:53:17.123 --> 02:53:22.929]  Oh yeah, the crew came out to the Mayor's Office of Film and Theater this past Monday to fight Bloomberg's First Amendment attack.
[02:53:23.436 --> 02:53:23.777]  I don't know.
[02:53:34.255 --> 02:53:39.377]  And the cops were there, actually, before we were, from what I hear, and they kind of were nice cops.
[02:53:39.397 --> 02:53:42.918]  It was a kind of a change, and they were kind of sympathizers of what we were doing.
[02:53:43.318 --> 02:53:48.180]  And they just told us that their bosses told them to stay there and be with us, you know, as long as we're out there.
[02:53:48.480 --> 02:53:50.961]  But they sympathized with what we were doing, and they actually supported us.
[02:53:51.061 --> 02:53:52.441]  And they really didn't confront us.
[02:53:52.461 --> 02:53:53.421]  They really weren't negative.
[02:53:53.862 --> 02:54:03.665]  It was actually something good, because you could actually see the police department kind of sympathizing with what we were doing, and kind of not standing behind us, but supporting us in any way they can.
[02:54:04.130 --> 02:54:04.891]  So that was really good.
[02:54:04.911 --> 02:54:06.032]  They didn't really challenge us.
[02:54:06.332 --> 02:54:08.935]  The video of that is on wearechange.org.
[02:54:08.955 --> 02:54:10.196]  The video just came out today.
[02:54:10.817 --> 02:54:15.821]  And, uh, hey man, we gotta let our voices be heard because the camera is the new weapon of the revolution.
[02:54:16.122 --> 02:54:18.264]  And that's why Mayor Bloomberg is trying to get rid of this thing.
[02:54:19.992 --> 02:54:24.937]  Now, you were telling me about something else that happened with the 9-11 Truth Meeting, and you saw a camera crew.
[02:54:24.957 --> 02:54:25.517]  What happened there?
[02:54:26.018 --> 02:54:27.039]  Oh yeah, in Philadelphia.
[02:54:27.079 --> 02:54:40.332]  That was yesterday at the anti-war emergency meeting in Philadelphia, where we had a whole big meeting with a lot of different organizations, a lot of different people came out, and then we saw NBC Live Truck doing a live news feed outside.
[02:54:40.754 --> 02:54:49.136]  And then me and my friends, we got the banner, we got three bullhorns, and we got about 50 people outside, screaming, Not 11 was an inside job, as NBC was doing a live feed.
[02:54:49.456 --> 02:54:58.618]  And even it gets better, because my friend Manny Bedillo, a family member, a Not 11 Victims family member, took the bullhorn, and was screaming at NBC, Why aren't you covering me?
[02:54:58.718 --> 02:55:02.259]  Why hasn't my voice been heard by NBC?
[02:55:02.579 --> 02:55:03.679]  Why are you ignoring us?
[02:55:03.739 --> 02:55:05.299]  Why are you working with GE?
[02:55:05.619 --> 02:55:07.600]  Why aren't you talking about the truth behind Not 11?
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:12.544]  And we really sent them a message that they can't do their jobs because they're not doing their jobs.
[02:55:12.604 --> 02:55:13.325]  They're not the media.
[02:55:13.345 --> 02:55:14.766]  They're the fourth branch of the government.
[02:55:15.006 --> 02:55:18.930]  And they're not covering the truth behind 9-11, the truth behind the New World Order and the Federal Reserve.
[02:55:20.402 --> 02:55:22.323]  Absolutely incredible, Luke.
[02:55:22.363 --> 02:55:27.264]  You guys are just continuing to do a fabulous job at WeAreChanger.org.
[02:55:27.625 --> 02:55:30.165]  What are some of the things you're planning to do in the next few days?
[02:55:30.526 --> 02:55:37.048]  We're going to be releasing a lot of video footage of Joe Biden, Joe Richardson again, and we have a lot of great content.
[02:55:37.068 --> 02:55:38.968]  We're just trying to get it out as soon as possible.
[02:55:39.209 --> 02:55:40.169]  We're working very hard.
[02:55:40.489 --> 02:55:43.290]  Every Saturday we're going to be going live on WeAreChanger.org.
[02:55:43.310 --> 02:55:45.771]  You can see live video of us at Ground Zero.
[02:55:46.131 --> 02:55:49.092]  Every Saturday, every street action, every 11th we do a street action.
[02:55:49.932 --> 02:55:50.573]  We're just active.
[02:55:50.613 --> 02:55:54.295]  We're not going to stop until... And you're planning some big stuff for 9-11.
[02:55:54.356 --> 02:55:55.536]  I'm going to be there.
[02:55:55.556 --> 02:55:59.639]  I'm telling everybody to be in New York on 9-11 coming up in a few months.
[02:55:59.659 --> 02:56:00.640]  This is going to be historic.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:02.181]  The 6th anniversary.
[02:56:03.202 --> 02:56:05.083]  Luke Radowsky, thanks for popping in with us.
[02:56:05.343 --> 02:56:06.084]  God bless you, Alex.

[02:56:06.564 --> 02:56:06.844]  Stay there.
[02:56:06.864 --> 02:56:08.485]  I want to talk to you when the show ends for a moment.
[02:56:08.986 --> 02:56:10.847]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I'm out of time.
[02:56:10.867 --> 02:56:13.289]  I've got this Homeland Security manual.
[02:56:14.546 --> 02:56:15.407]  Secret manual.
[02:56:15.967 --> 02:56:20.772]  We'll be going over this traitorous, anti-American document.
[02:56:21.112 --> 02:56:22.373]  Have that up on the website for you.
[02:56:22.413 --> 02:56:23.174]  God bless you all.
