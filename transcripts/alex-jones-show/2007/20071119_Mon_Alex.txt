[00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:06.219]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:07.920]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.762]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:11.203]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.964 --> 00:00:12.904]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.388]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.729 --> 00:00:21.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.994 --> 00:00:27.975]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:28.095 --> 00:00:28.916]  Welcome.
[00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:30.977]  It is the 19th day of November 2007.
[00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:38.843]  We're going to be live for the next three hours, and we've got a special guest joining us, and then we're going to have wide-open phones.
[00:00:39.524 --> 00:00:42.766]  Ed Asner will be on tomorrow's transmission.
[00:00:43.107 --> 00:00:53.214]  Then, of course, we are scheduled to have Ron Paul from his home in Texas joining us as well, coming up on Tuesday.
[00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:55.216]  No, Wednesday.
[00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:58.570]  Someone, I guess, it's hard to keep track of it all.
[00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.850]  Big broadcast, very important transmission lined up for you today.
[00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:13.272]  We're going to have open phones as well at 1-800-259-9231 on any news issue or item you would like to discuss.
[00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:16.153]  Kellyanne Davis is an autism activist.
[00:01:16.193 --> 00:01:20.534]  Her child was damaged by the mercury filled chemical weapon.
[00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:27.921]  And she went down to cover what was happening in a Maryland suburb of D.C.
[00:01:28.802 --> 00:01:38.471]  Remember last Thursday we had the state attorney on, who'd been on the news, and the newscast had been saying that you had to take the shots or you'd be arrested ten days in jail for the immunizations.
[00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:40.893]  And we put a report out on that Thursday.
[00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:41.874]  It went supernova.
[00:01:41.914 --> 00:01:42.895]  Another on Friday.
[00:01:43.796 --> 00:01:44.236]  Huge.
[00:01:44.757 --> 00:01:46.839]  Out there on the web, thanks to you getting the word out.
[00:01:47.512 --> 00:01:51.336]  And we're starting to win this fight as people get outraged and learn there is no law.
[00:01:51.856 --> 00:02:06.731]  But the people showed up and multiple witnesses have reported and the AP has reported that they were not giving people waivers or telling them about waivers and that hundreds and hundreds of people did show up and were coerced via color of law into taking the shots.
[00:02:08.467 --> 00:02:11.768]  This is a big issue because it feeds into everything else the government's doing.
[00:02:11.808 --> 00:02:15.069]  The dishonesty, the color of law, the coercion.
[00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:18.470]  And there's so many other big issues where they're doing this as well.
[00:02:19.151 --> 00:02:28.554]  And I really enjoyed reading the very intelligent comments that were in our message board at theprisonplanet.com message board and also on the Digg comments off of these stories.
[00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:32.225]  Parents kept in dark about vaccine waiver.
[00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:33.965]  It was done by Paul Watson.
[00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:38.246]  Religious and personal objection forms not included in information pack.
[00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:41.047]  Police followed advocacy reporters to bathroom.
[00:02:41.848 --> 00:02:47.209]  Kids herded in line to take shots with no regard to medical or vaccine history.
[00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.010]  Many parents were there saying they've had all these shots.
[00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.651]  The school has already given it to them and they've lost the records.
[00:02:54.398 --> 00:02:55.920]  By the way, that's what the military does.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:12.535]  That's been in the news many times, but I've been told countless times by people in the military, going back to Korean War, Vietnam, Gulf War I or II, that they would just give them shots after shots after shots, and they'd get shots, and they'd land in South Korea, and they'd say, I just got all these.
[00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:14.337]  They'd say, well, the records aren't here yet.
[00:03:14.677 --> 00:03:15.878]  We're giving you more shots.
[00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.102]  And they'd give them more shots, and they'd vomit and flop around on the ground for a couple days.
[00:03:21.075 --> 00:03:22.376]  Well, people would die.
[00:03:22.396 --> 00:03:25.418]  There's just no ending to this.
[00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:29.801]  So we're going to be breaking all of that down today for you.
[00:03:31.041 --> 00:03:42.369]  Also, it really outraged people last Wednesday when Glenn Beck said that Ron Paul supporters are terrorists, that the military should be used against the American people.
[00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:50.434]  Anti-war groups, libertarians, Lou Rockwell, he's listed me by name on the radio as quote, very, very dangerous.
[00:03:51.872 --> 00:03:59.837]  I'm sorry that we cover all the declassified mainstream news reports where criminals in our government have staged terror attacks in the past.
[00:04:00.537 --> 00:04:06.100]  I'm sorry we're reporting on the fact that the Pentagon's engaging in domestic propaganda against the American people.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.443]  I'm sorry we're educating people about the public statements by chieftains of the New World Order.
[00:04:12.704 --> 00:04:18.567]  But, as they say, the jig is up, and we're not going to play along with this anymore.
[00:04:19.548 --> 00:04:19.928]  We're done.
[00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:22.769]  We are fed up.
[00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:32.432]  And Glenn Beck, O'Reilly, countless other neocon frontmen, government frontmen, and they're clearly admittedly going off government talking points.
[00:04:35.293 --> 00:04:38.614]  You admit that you've got 11% approval now.
[00:04:39.715 --> 00:04:41.395]  You've got 11% approval.
[00:04:42.356 --> 00:04:43.636]  The people know who you are.
[00:04:44.337 --> 00:04:45.337]  They know what you've done.
[00:04:46.395 --> 00:04:51.076]  And, uh, you're only making your audience shrink that much faster.
[00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:54.838]  So we're gonna cover, uh, this and a lot more today.
[00:04:55.378 --> 00:04:56.758]  And take your phone calls.
[00:04:57.458 --> 00:05:00.059]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.000]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.141]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.841 --> 00:05:10.462]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[00:05:10.722 --> 00:05:12.523]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:05:13.583 --> 00:05:15.744]  Both their objective be world domination.
[00:05:16.351 --> 00:05:18.793]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.533 --> 00:05:26.858]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.873 --> 00:05:34.856]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:38.799]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:41.721]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:05:41.761 --> 00:05:42.922]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:43.702]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.722 --> 00:05:44.783]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:44.983 --> 00:05:45.724]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.984 --> 00:05:47.005]  That's what they're after.

[00:07:00.689 --> 00:07:03.632]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:08.937]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.317 --> 00:07:14.582]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:16.143]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.504 --> 00:07:25.492]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.413]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[00:07:27.653 --> 00:07:31.835]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:59.408]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:08.313]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.913 --> 00:08:11.895]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.898 --> 00:08:23.799]  Alright, we're going to get into forced inoculation in this country.
[00:08:23.839 --> 00:08:32.001]  They herded, according to the AP, more than a thousand school children in a major suburb of D.C.
[00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:38.903]  in Maryland into a courthouse, and they believe they were being forced to be inoculated.
[00:08:38.923 --> 00:08:44.264]  They were pleading, begging, saying, no, we've already had these shots, we don't want them, please don't send us to jail.
[00:08:45.304 --> 00:08:47.125]  And the news even reported this fact.
[00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:58.691]  Meanwhile, we have interviewed the state attorneys saying, oh no, we give them all waivers, they don't have to come, but then they have all the newscasts saying, you have to come take it, it's the law, but there is no law.
[00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:04.754]  So this isn't just about the precedent being set for forced inoculations in this country when there is no law.
[00:09:06.075 --> 00:09:14.380]  It's a wider issue of how the government across the board engages in these types of mass crimes because of an ignorant public.
[00:09:15.814 --> 00:09:27.404]  Then I want to spend a large portion of the broadcast today with a special report that Steve Watson wrote Friday that hasn't gotten the attention it needs for InfoWars.net.
[00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:41.976]  He wrote it for InfoWars.net and has not gotten the attention it needs because I got on the phone with him and Paul and I said, listen, I listed about 20 things where they admit they're setting up for martial law the last couple years, how that integrates in with Glenn Beck,
[00:09:44.013 --> 00:09:55.155]  Coming out with O'Reilly and others saying, arrest Ron Paul supporters, use the military against them, they're aiding terrorists, they're in bed with the Islamo-fascist Al Qaeda, the Founding Fathers are bad.
[00:09:55.175 --> 00:10:04.657]  And I said, put your thinking cap on, I know that I can't even grasp how many admissions and instances and places where they're conditioning the public for this to actually happen.
[00:10:05.237 --> 00:10:05.777]  And he did it.
[00:10:05.817 --> 00:10:09.038]  He outdid anything I've seen before or since.
[00:10:10.198 --> 00:10:14.220]  Because he found dozens and dozens of things I had totally forgotten about.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:29.387]  It is 13 pages of small typeset, tightly compacted paragraphs, and a bunch of this I'd forgotten about or had covered years ago or had covered in the last few months or hadn't covered.
[00:10:29.407 --> 00:10:31.928]  It is a nightmare!
[00:10:33.095 --> 00:10:53.798]  But if we show people this information, and we can get people to read this 13-page report of incredible research, and really, the sum of knowledge that I've learned, that Steve has learned, Steve's got a Master's, by the way, in Political Science, that Paul Watson has learned, that so many other scholars have discovered, you read this, it is crystal clear
[00:10:55.310 --> 00:11:06.279]  In fact, I would imagine this mirrors actual RAM Corporation, we've seen some of their previous ones, own documents and own battle plans and own blueprints.
[00:11:08.981 --> 00:11:13.665]  This will probably end up being used internally as some type of textbook material for them.
[00:11:13.725 --> 00:11:18.949]  It's much better than even what they can put together, because most of the government is compartmentalized.
[00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:31.744]  This is so powerful, this could even be used by the enemy for higher-ups to fully understand their own matrix control grid that they have built.
[00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:38.490]  That's how powerful this report is, turning the police state apparatus against the sinners.
[00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:44.615]  And I don't think this headline even does justice to what Steve has put together.
[00:11:47.094 --> 00:12:09.729]  But I am going to spend at least the last 45 minutes, so we'll have open phones in the first hour and the second hour, I'm going to spend at least the last 45 minutes of the broadcast today to do my darndest, my dead-level best, to read all this slowly, calmly, on air.
[00:12:11.124 --> 00:12:26.289]  But of course, listeners, you're welcome to talk about the admitted talking points of the White House and State Department, admitted Homeland Security meetings in the last two weeks in Congress, admitted bills sailing through now on the verge of passing the Senate to literally restrict free speech in the U.S.
[00:12:26.369 --> 00:12:32.331]  and literally, when we heard they were going to set this up a month and a half ago, the domestic terrorism prevention system,
[00:12:32.964 --> 00:12:33.585]  We're good to go.
[00:12:48.595 --> 00:12:52.777]  We've got the FEMA training videos going back eight years ago, right through to today.
[00:12:53.257 --> 00:13:05.983]  We have all the training manuals, the law enforcement flyers, the law enforcement publications, the police then carrying out the operations from their own squad car videos, going through the training, arresting people for pocket constitutions.
[00:13:08.007 --> 00:13:11.550]  I mean, I have the term I overuse, that you can't make this stuff up.
[00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:15.472]  This is so insane and so ridiculous on the surface.
[00:13:15.933 --> 00:13:20.716]  Police have sworn an oath to this, but they'll arrest you, many of them who've had this training for having it.
[00:13:20.756 --> 00:13:29.402]  And I have, what, Law Enforcement Magazine out of, this was in 2000, out of Dallas.
[00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:30.403]  It's published out of Dallas.
[00:13:31.823 --> 00:13:34.424]  I think it was called Law Enforcement Technology, I'm going from memory.
[00:13:34.764 --> 00:13:41.546]  But it said, officers, if you see someone where they get us out of the UN sticker on their car, pull them over, go ahead and arrest them.
[00:13:42.486 --> 00:13:43.726]  Chances are they're terrorists.
[00:13:44.527 --> 00:13:53.469]  It actually says this, and it said, it said, and police chiefs, don't get mad at your officers for bringing these people in.
[00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:56.530]  Just go ahead and arrest them.
[00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.271]  And do whatever you can to put them in jail.
[00:14:00.091 --> 00:14:02.453]  I mean, how do they have major magazines that say that?
[00:14:03.193 --> 00:14:17.001]  And I know there's police out there listening who've read this stuff and seen this stuff, and we've written articles about it, but... I mean, even if you disagree with us about abolishing the United Nations or getting us out of the UN, it's our right to say it.
[00:14:17.081 --> 00:14:19.163]  It's our right to do it.
[00:14:19.443 --> 00:14:21.904]  It's our right to have it on our car.
[00:14:21.964 --> 00:14:23.145]  I mean, this is America!
[00:14:25.567 --> 00:14:25.807]  So...
[00:14:29.082 --> 00:14:33.725]  We'll be going over that in great detail because he's put it all together in one spot.
[00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:37.107]  I mean, I'm asking you to go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:37.147 --> 00:14:38.227]  It's the easiest place to find it.
[00:14:38.267 --> 00:14:45.952]  On the right-hand side, news and focus, top story, right-hand side column, police state turns against dissenters.
[00:14:48.273 --> 00:14:54.777]  And I mean, I would call this complete program to incrementally set up martial law in the U.S.
[00:14:55.763 --> 00:14:59.605]  Or the public program to convert the U.S.
[00:14:59.645 --> 00:15:03.206]  from a free republic to an absolute despotism.
[00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.867]  I mean, again, just go read it.
[00:15:07.848 --> 00:15:08.528]  Go link through.
[00:15:08.548 --> 00:15:10.269]  Go watch the clips, the documents.
[00:15:10.969 --> 00:15:15.771]  This is twelve years of my research and many other people's research.
[00:15:16.711 --> 00:15:18.412]  And it's all in their own words.
[00:15:18.432 --> 00:15:19.012]  Do you understand?
[00:15:19.512 --> 00:15:20.793]  This is not debatable.
[00:15:26.505 --> 00:15:31.027]  Now, I had the... Let's shift gears into the vaccine story.
[00:15:33.609 --> 00:15:38.371]  Before I get into our Ron Paul supporters, constitutional terrorists, and the rest of it.
[00:15:39.292 --> 00:15:52.559]  I had the lawyer, the state attorney on, who's been a federal prosecutor as well, and he admitted that his children don't take the hepatitis B shot because that's their right.
[00:15:53.507 --> 00:16:00.009]  And then he went on to say, oh no, we tell them about the waiver, but on none of these newscasts, on MSNBC or Fox, do they do that.
[00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:19.573]  They say, you have got to come in, you've got to take the shot, you have, it's the law, you'll be arrested, and I've got articles out of Texas again where they're saying it's the law, you've got to take the HPV shot, and articles out of England where they're saying it's the law, England's the same deal, there is no law, they kick you out for truancy, and then they arrest you for that.
[00:16:24.341 --> 00:16:31.087]  And last night on the Sunday Show, I re-aired that clip of a State Attorney Glenn Ivey.
[00:16:31.427 --> 00:16:33.068]  I may even do that later.
[00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:43.737]  But the story here is that I talked off-air to one witness who was there, and I talked to another witness who was there and also covered on local news.
[00:16:44.898 --> 00:16:51.143]  And then the AP even admitted that they were not given waivers, they were lined up, they begged and pleaded and said they didn't want it.
[00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:54.131]  And they thought they were being forcibly inoculated.
[00:16:54.612 --> 00:17:00.175]  So this was done purely through color of law, pure coercion, just absolute abuse.
[00:17:01.015 --> 00:17:03.297]  Parents kept in dark about vaccine waiver.
[00:17:04.137 --> 00:17:08.180]  Religious and personal objection forms not included in information pack.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.101]  Police followed advocacy reporters to bathroom.
[00:17:11.982 --> 00:17:16.544]  Kids heard it in line to take shots with no regard to medical or vaccine history.
[00:17:17.065 --> 00:17:19.066]  Parents of children in Prince George County, Maryland
[00:17:20.071 --> 00:17:20.672]  We're good to go.
[00:17:48.254 --> 00:17:50.896]  Vector and is very dangerous, and that's even admitted.
[00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:53.197]  They don't debate that hepatitis B is bad news.
[00:17:53.698 --> 00:18:00.762]  According to observers who were able to gain access to the courthouse, children with a history of medical issues were not properly screened.
[00:18:00.782 --> 00:18:07.066]  If you've got heart valve problems or infections, there's hundreds of reasons not to take it, but they don't care.
[00:18:07.707 --> 00:18:12.450]  Screened as parents were simply told to get in line and have their kids take the shots.
[00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:15.992]  This has the look of a federal program to it, I'll just say that.
[00:18:17.199 --> 00:18:21.584]  Many of those in line said their children were properly immunized.
[00:18:21.744 --> 00:18:22.885]  See, they're even submitting to it.
[00:18:23.166 --> 00:18:25.348]  But the school system had misplaced the records.
[00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:31.435]  They said efforts to get the paperwork straightened out beforehand had been futile, reported the Associated Press.
[00:18:31.555 --> 00:18:32.596]  See, there you go.
[00:18:33.823 --> 00:18:54.217]  In the following video, Kellyanne Davis, a member of Safe Minds, a national autism advocacy organization, whose son Miles was diagnosed with autism in 2002 as a result of mercury poisoning from vaccines, relates how she was also followed by police with dogs, and there's photos of that, to the bathroom after being told she was not one of them.
[00:18:57.406 --> 00:19:08.996]  She also explains how the information pack sounded out to parents before they lined up to have their kids take the shots, failed to include waiver forms, being given parents the right to opt out due to personal, religious, or medical exemptions.
[00:19:09.917 --> 00:19:14.941]  And she exposed that, and they said, okay, we're going to add it in there, but never did.
[00:19:17.523 --> 00:19:25.110]  State Attorney Glenn Ivey, who admitted during a radio interview last week that no law mandates the shots, and also that he had chosen not to give his children the vaccines,
[00:19:25.982 --> 00:19:32.908]  Confirmed that the exemption forms were available from the back of the room, but that was separated by a gate.
[00:19:33.388 --> 00:19:37.091]  However, when asked if they were aware of the right to opt out, parents were miffed.
[00:19:37.511 --> 00:19:43.696]  News reports failed to cite any cases where parents had opted out as a result of signing waiver forms.
[00:19:44.637 --> 00:19:50.001]  This is what they're doing, not just with these vaccines and their biochemical weapon program against us, and that's what it is.
[00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:51.302]  Declassified U.S.
[00:19:51.343 --> 00:19:52.023]  government documents.
[00:19:52.403 --> 00:19:53.344]  This is about everything else.
[00:19:53.364 --> 00:19:54.325]  This is how they operate.
[00:20:01.365 --> 00:20:02.345]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.426 --> 00:20:07.188]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.368 --> 00:20:15.171]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.431 --> 00:20:20.814]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:21.014 --> 00:20:27.977]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.277 --> 00:20:33.622]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:33.883 --> 00:20:38.627]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:38.947 --> 00:20:46.555]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:46.895 --> 00:20:53.138]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.438 --> 00:20:56.979]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.319 --> 00:21:00.221]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.801 --> 00:21:07.744]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America while the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:21:09.004 --> 00:21:13.046]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:20.837]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain and Western Europe.
[00:21:21.718 --> 00:21:30.481]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[00:21:31.141 --> 00:21:36.223]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:36.723 --> 00:21:37.223]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.

[00:21:53.231 --> 00:21:54.492]  It's absolutely free.
[00:22:01.033 --> 00:22:01.513]  Hi, Ken.
[00:22:01.553 --> 00:22:02.333]  It's Judy again.
[00:22:02.353 --> 00:22:06.875]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[00:22:07.035 --> 00:22:10.176]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[00:22:10.376 --> 00:22:12.256]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[00:22:12.276 --> 00:22:14.617]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[00:22:14.797 --> 00:22:20.899]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[00:22:21.119 --> 00:22:26.401]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[00:22:26.681 --> 00:22:29.522]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[00:22:29.662 --> 00:22:30.582]  Go KenSolar!
[00:22:31.872 --> 00:22:33.393]  Get the best of both worlds.

[00:22:45.018 --> 00:22:47.699]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.

[00:22:50.901 --> 00:22:55.003]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[00:22:55.183 --> 00:22:59.004]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[00:23:00.672 --> 00:23:05.600]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.803]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:23:08.003 --> 00:23:11.048]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:23:11.228 --> 00:23:14.373]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:23:14.673 --> 00:23:16.536]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:23:16.796 --> 00:23:20.500]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:23.443]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[00:23:24.063 --> 00:23:24.644]  2 Peter says,
[00:23:33.232 --> 00:23:37.575]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:23:37.875 --> 00:23:42.138]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:23:42.458 --> 00:23:48.342]  You will receive information regarding America in Prophecy, Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more.
[00:23:48.643 --> 00:23:51.084]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[00:23:51.284 --> 00:23:51.785]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:52.905]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[00:24:10.381 --> 00:24:25.365]  By the way, we just, minutes ago, got the results of a Zogby poll we commissioned last week that they held on Friday.
[00:24:25.385 --> 00:24:28.606]  And Ron Paul won.
[00:24:29.906 --> 00:24:31.287]  Ron Paul won.
[00:24:32.807 --> 00:24:35.508]  We asked three different questions.
[00:24:36.764 --> 00:24:38.585]  And Ron Paul won!
[00:24:39.965 --> 00:24:42.766]  And so I'm going to be getting the poll to Paul Watson.
[00:24:44.206 --> 00:24:45.427]  We commissioned Zogby.
[00:24:45.707 --> 00:24:53.449]  We asked the questions fairly compared to what other media outlets and campaigns have been doing, trying to spin it, push polls, you name it.
[00:24:53.750 --> 00:25:04.433]  We simply... Well, I'm going to read the whole poll on air and we're going to post the poll and the actual questions so you can see for yourself.
[00:25:05.584 --> 00:25:10.427]  So you can discover for yourself just exactly what we did.
[00:25:10.887 --> 00:25:18.431]  And Ron Paul won a nationwide poll, telephone poll of thousands of people, and that's on the old landline system.
[00:25:19.011 --> 00:25:31.137]  I think I'm going to now with another polling agency, though I don't want to blow all the money I've got in our business account, but it's important for the campaign to have an internet scientific poll done that they do scientifically with internet respondents.
[00:25:32.532 --> 00:25:33.953]  So that's another big report.
[00:25:34.313 --> 00:25:39.895]  By the first of the third hour today, I will have the details of that for you.
[00:25:40.756 --> 00:25:42.316]  We just came in during the last break.
[00:25:43.037 --> 00:25:49.319]  And Aaron, as soon as you get a chance, my friend, I was just reading them during the break.
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.641]  Give me the exact results of that so I can have them in front of me.
[00:25:53.678 --> 00:25:54.199]  We're good to go.
[00:26:17.364 --> 00:26:18.025]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:26:45.058 --> 00:26:46.119]  Zombie wasn't offering that.
[00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:50.682]  The point is that it's been all over the press how these polls are conducted with a bunch of different agencies.
[00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:53.284]  I just said, no, I want it done as fairly as possible.
[00:26:53.324 --> 00:26:54.024]  Here are my questions.
[00:26:54.044 --> 00:26:58.867]  And they said, wow, nobody ever gives us questions that we don't have to change to quote, make them fair.
[00:26:58.887 --> 00:27:01.729]  Now this is a really fair, straight up poll.
[00:27:01.789 --> 00:27:02.670]  And I said, yeah, it is.
[00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:03.771]  Now let's see who wins.
[00:27:04.871 --> 00:27:05.812]  Well, guess who won?
[00:27:06.613 --> 00:27:07.193]  Ron Paul.
[00:27:09.014 --> 00:27:09.975]  I knew that would happen.
[00:27:10.615 --> 00:27:11.516]  I just knew it.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.123]  I had to blow four and a half thousand dollars, but who cares?
[00:27:20.723 --> 00:27:27.327]  That's why your purchase of my documentary films like Endgame or Loose Change Final Cut from mfolewars.com are so important.
[00:27:27.347 --> 00:27:28.467]  Because you know what we do with that money?
[00:27:29.188 --> 00:27:30.068]  We conduct polls.
[00:27:30.148 --> 00:27:35.531]  We're having a Ron Paul video one-minute ad contest.
[00:27:35.571 --> 00:27:37.292]  The total will be $2,600 in prizes.
[00:27:40.069 --> 00:27:40.710]  We're good to go.
[00:28:06.835 --> 00:28:09.656]  TruthNews.us and please help get that out.
[00:28:09.696 --> 00:28:10.356]  And what will happen?
[00:28:10.716 --> 00:28:12.377]  Hundreds of TV ads will get made.
[00:28:12.417 --> 00:28:13.717]  They'll be all over YouTube and Google.
[00:28:14.377 --> 00:28:15.838]  Millions of people will see them.
[00:28:17.458 --> 00:28:20.139]  And then the winners will win.
[00:28:20.379 --> 00:28:20.919]  So who wins?
[00:28:20.959 --> 00:28:21.960]  The country and Ron Paul.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.681]  And so it's pretty simple why we did that.
[00:28:27.701 --> 00:28:30.302]  And it's the same thing with this poll.
[00:28:31.422 --> 00:28:33.043]  And I promise to publish it.
[00:28:34.372 --> 00:28:37.914]  You know, I told Zogby Friday, I said, now you'll publish this, right?
[00:28:37.934 --> 00:28:39.175]  Well, you give us permission, we will.
[00:28:40.636 --> 00:28:44.018]  And then I was just talking to him, I go, well, maybe there's a commission for putting a press release out.
[00:28:44.058 --> 00:28:46.240]  No, Zogby, I know, I've read how it works.
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.802]  You publish the poll results, and the people want them published.
[00:28:49.842 --> 00:28:57.287]  Now, we have them and are allowed to publish them ourselves, and we will be, but I guess we have to play by different rules since Ron Paul won.
[00:28:57.307 --> 00:28:59.248]  This isn't something I guess people want to herald.
[00:29:00.372 --> 00:29:14.860]  And so we will be sure and publish that out there, but I don't know, the head of Zogby was sitting on Ron Paul showing 15 points, 15% or second place right now in New Hampshire and could win.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.522]  So we'll integrate that into the story as well.
[00:29:21.583 --> 00:29:23.264]  But I can't control myself.
[00:29:23.304 --> 00:29:26.626]  I think I have to cover this Ron Paul thing right now, but I've got a guest coming on about vaccines.
[00:29:28.827 --> 00:29:30.548]  Bottom line, very important broadcast today.
[00:29:30.568 --> 00:29:31.328]  This is big news.
[00:29:31.348 --> 00:29:31.949]  Ron Paul.
[00:29:32.849 --> 00:29:35.451]  And I just looked at it for two minutes during the break.
[00:29:36.352 --> 00:29:41.015]  Right now I'm going to run out there literally salivating on the papers to make sure.
[00:29:42.797 --> 00:29:43.777]  I saw that number.
[00:29:43.797 --> 00:29:44.318]  35% Ron Paul.
[00:29:44.518 --> 00:29:45.078]  And he won.
[00:29:45.098 --> 00:29:47.000]  We're on the march.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.341]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.261 --> 00:29:57.971]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.380]  Storable food!

[00:30:27.787 --> 00:30:29.747]  The powder will feed the body vital minerals.
[00:30:29.927 --> 00:30:32.589]  And the oil will clean the arterial walls and feed the brain.

[00:30:49.102 --> 00:30:52.264]  Holidays are coming and this would make a perfect gift for friends and family.

[00:31:01.792 --> 00:31:03.633]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:03.774 --> 00:31:10.479]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:31:10.739 --> 00:31:18.906]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:19.146 --> 00:31:24.871]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:25.031 --> 00:31:26.792]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:31:26.873 --> 00:31:29.014]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:29.034 --> 00:31:33.418]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:33.578 --> 00:31:35.740]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:43.586]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:31:43.626 --> 00:31:44.487]  We're good to go.
[00:32:03.027 --> 00:32:07.068]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[00:32:07.848 --> 00:32:15.710]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Border, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:21.492]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts.
[00:32:22.273 --> 00:32:28.274]  Now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:35.616]  Central, formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated but never duplicated.
[00:32:36.316 --> 00:32:42.658]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[00:32:43.158 --> 00:32:48.259]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[00:32:49.019 --> 00:32:51.500]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:55.721]  I've now had time to look at the poll in more detail.
[00:32:55.741 --> 00:33:08.803]  Ron Paul wants some of the questions even bigger than I thought.
[00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:25.962]  This was a poll going directly at Republicans.
[00:33:26.022 --> 00:33:30.505]  She polls even higher in Democrats, which is why he's key to going against Hillary Clinton.
[00:33:31.325 --> 00:33:32.686]  So there's a lot of angles to this.
[00:33:32.706 --> 00:33:34.267]  There'll probably be two or three stories today.
[00:33:34.687 --> 00:33:37.809]  By Paul Watson, by Kurt Niemow, by Steve Watson, by Aaron Dykes.
[00:33:38.349 --> 00:33:43.332]  This is a... I wanted to have a really simple, short poll, and they told me this is one of their shorter polls.
[00:33:43.352 --> 00:33:46.494]  It was like three pages of questions.
[00:33:46.634 --> 00:33:50.116]  You know, the quote, three questions, but each question was a page long.
[00:33:51.984 --> 00:33:55.946]  And I even let them leave things in there that, frankly, were leaning towards Romney.
[00:33:55.966 --> 00:33:57.046]  They just kept insisting.
[00:33:57.247 --> 00:33:58.227]  Romney's got some pull.
[00:34:00.128 --> 00:34:02.809]  And we had a debate back and forth on that.
[00:34:02.849 --> 00:34:05.130]  I just said, you know, that didn't change a lot.
[00:34:06.071 --> 00:34:08.792]  But, well, again, here's the problem.
[00:34:08.832 --> 00:34:09.672]  I got in this morning.
[00:34:09.692 --> 00:34:10.733]  I've been getting ready for the show.
[00:34:11.233 --> 00:34:16.175]  Zogby said we could get it as early as Friday night, as late as Monday evening.
[00:34:16.235 --> 00:34:17.516]  We got it about 25 minutes ago.
[00:34:21.295 --> 00:34:25.638]  I watched Aaron get real excited looking at his computer screen from Zogby.
[00:34:25.958 --> 00:34:27.479]  Aaron, just come on in here real fast.
[00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:29.720]  I've got him in there brainstorming, reading over all this.
[00:34:32.082 --> 00:34:33.643]  Just run in here real fast for me, Bubba.
[00:34:34.824 --> 00:34:36.925]  I want people to hear this whole discussion.
[00:34:39.147 --> 00:34:44.790]  Aaron, I wanted to not get you on air, but I want people just to hear this discussion.
[00:34:45.691 --> 00:34:50.714]  I want you to call... Friday Zogby told us that if we gave them authorization, they would post it on their website.
[00:34:51.784 --> 00:34:53.925]  And then now they're saying they're not sure?
[00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:55.947]  What are they saying?
[00:34:55.967 --> 00:34:57.108]  I'm checking right now.
[00:34:57.328 --> 00:34:58.288]  One guy didn't know for sure.
[00:34:58.969 --> 00:35:00.810]  Okay, so you're just talking to some lowly person.
[00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:02.531]  I mean, you know, one of the lower level people?
[00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:07.895]  He's a writer who got the results of the poll, and then they have other people who have the policies, I guess.
[00:35:08.955 --> 00:35:12.978]  Okay, yeah, but they told us over the telephone, and I read their policies, and I know how Zogby works.
[00:35:13.038 --> 00:35:14.919]  If you want it posted on their site, they do that.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:15.440]  Okay.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.482]  Well, let me tell them that that was represented to us.
[00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:22.111]  Because the neocons, when we put this out, are going to say it doesn't even exist.
[00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:27.033]  You know, they say the moon's made of cheese and that the Easter Bunny's real, but we don't exist.
[00:35:28.354 --> 00:35:30.655]  Man, reading over this, I'm going to let you get back to work.
[00:35:30.955 --> 00:35:43.800]  Call Watson, though, in case he's not listening, and let him know to immediately tune in to my analysis coming up in the next hour on this, because how many pages total did you get from them?
[00:35:44.921 --> 00:35:45.961]  It looks like 30 pages.
[00:35:49.565 --> 00:35:51.606]  We're going to simplify the results in the next day.
[00:35:51.786 --> 00:35:53.887]  There's a street sweeper out of the studio door open.
[00:35:56.088 --> 00:35:56.709]  My goodness.
[00:35:57.669 --> 00:35:58.310]  You're saying what?
[00:35:58.350 --> 00:35:58.970]  What about the data?
[00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.631]  We're looking at tabular data.
[00:36:00.651 --> 00:36:04.073]  They're going to simplify it the way that they publish the results in the next day or so.
[00:36:05.373 --> 00:36:05.714]  Okay.
[00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:10.816]  But we can put this out now, right?
[00:36:12.037 --> 00:36:12.277]  Yeah.
[00:36:14.598 --> 00:36:14.878]  Okay.
[00:36:16.801 --> 00:36:21.422]  Get them on the horn and find out how long until I get the crunch data.
[00:36:24.342 --> 00:36:25.062]  Oh my gosh.
[00:36:25.363 --> 00:36:25.883]  Okay.
[00:36:25.923 --> 00:36:29.223]  I'm babbling on air, ladies and gentlemen, because we're in the middle of the war room here.
[00:36:30.263 --> 00:36:30.783]  Thank you, Aaron.
[00:36:36.004 --> 00:36:44.726]  Let me go ahead and just play some clips of these newscasts getting back into the vaccines while I deal with these results of the Zogby poll.
[00:36:46.917 --> 00:36:54.180]  I'll tell you this, we asked three different questions, and Ron Paul won two of them, and he lost one of them.
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:37:01.323]  So Ron Paul wins big, and again, we did this to quote, make it fair.
[00:37:01.383 --> 00:37:08.465]  I have to tell you, it really leaned towards the other candidates, because I wanted to really be able to say, and everybody read the questions, which we're going to publish with it.
[00:37:09.986 --> 00:37:15.648]  And I wanted people to be able to witness this for themselves, and I wanted people to be able to understand
[00:37:16.689 --> 00:37:21.539]  All right, let's go ahead first before I get back into this vaccine situation.
[00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:29.372]  And play a piece of the Fox 5 piece, then we'll play this MSNBC piece, a piece of it, just to give you the idea of what they're putting out to the public.
[00:37:29.392 --> 00:37:30.552]  Here it is.
[00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:35.933]  First at 5 tonight, 800 local families forced to come to court for something they have not given their children.
[00:37:36.213 --> 00:37:37.754]  Hello everyone, I'm Shawn Yancey.
[00:37:37.774 --> 00:37:38.594]  And I'm Laura Evans.
[00:37:38.674 --> 00:37:43.735]  More than 2,000 Prince George's County students have not gotten their state-mandated shot.
[00:37:43.915 --> 00:37:48.416]  Tonight, an ultimatum to some of those parents, come to court, get the shot, or else.
[00:37:48.836 --> 00:37:51.137]  Fox 5's Sherri Lee Lime in Forestville to explain this one.
[00:37:51.157 --> 00:37:51.457]  Sherri?
[00:37:52.157 --> 00:38:06.225]  Laura, some students here in Prince George's County Schools have missed up to a month and a half of school because they have not gotten their vaccinations for chickenpox and hepatitis B. Now the school system says it's time to get tough and take those parents to court.
[00:38:07.389 --> 00:38:11.613]  Free clinics, free shots, door-to-door visits, and countless letters.
[00:38:12.033 --> 00:38:17.137]  Still more than 2,300 Prince George's County students don't have their required immunizations.
[00:38:17.257 --> 00:38:19.419]  We need those students immunized.
[00:38:19.799 --> 00:38:21.421]  We need them in schools.
[00:38:21.761 --> 00:38:23.503]  We need them... Stop the tape for a minute.
[00:38:24.263 --> 00:38:26.505]  So the message is they did everything they could.
[00:38:26.545 --> 00:38:27.786]  They were so reasonable.
[00:38:28.106 --> 00:38:29.888]  The government's so reasonable.
[00:38:29.948 --> 00:38:31.569]  They just want to keep the kids safe.
[00:38:31.649 --> 00:38:34.071]  And these bad kids have broken the law.
[00:38:34.091 --> 00:38:35.513]  They've got to have their shots.
[00:38:36.542 --> 00:38:40.706]  We just need them to have their shots and not, hey, there's no law.
[00:38:40.786 --> 00:38:42.787]  We shouldn't have expelled them from school.
[00:38:43.127 --> 00:38:44.529]  We violated their rights.
[00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:47.491]  We're screwing up their, quote, education.
[00:38:47.531 --> 00:38:51.274]  If you can call a government training camp, brainwashing center, re-education camp that.
[00:38:51.875 --> 00:38:54.597]  And we're getting tough now.
[00:38:54.637 --> 00:38:56.879]  And you can do it the easy way or the hard way.
[00:38:56.919 --> 00:39:03.824]  And then at the very end they mention, oh, by the way, there's a waiver procedure that's kind of like Lewis and Clark crossing the
[00:39:05.077 --> 00:39:10.780]  The West, it's very hard, but you know, if you can jump through a thousand flaming hoops, we might let you not take it.
[00:39:12.281 --> 00:39:16.883]  And they didn't even used to do this a few years ago, until we started screaming bloody murder about it, the fact that there was no law.
[00:39:16.903 --> 00:39:19.724]  Now they have to add that little caveat in their deception.
[00:39:20.425 --> 00:39:21.285]  So, back to it.
[00:39:21.903 --> 00:39:22.503]  Immunized!
[00:39:22.924 --> 00:39:24.525]  We need them in schools!
[00:39:24.885 --> 00:39:26.186]  We need them safe!
[00:39:26.746 --> 00:39:34.090]  This Saturday, more than 1,600 students and their parents have been ordered to appear in circuit court for the children to be immunized.
[00:39:34.451 --> 00:39:37.593]  Health workers will be on hand to give the shots immediately.
[00:39:37.893 --> 00:39:42.355]  We can do this the easy way or we can do this the hard way, but it's going to have to get done.
[00:39:42.976 --> 00:39:50.741]  The problem is a new law that took effect last year, requiring students in the 5th through 10th grades to also have the chickenpox and hepatitis B vaccine.
[00:39:50.761 --> 00:39:51.401]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:39:52.313 --> 00:39:53.314]  See, there's the spin.
[00:39:53.374 --> 00:39:59.139]  The problem is a new law that also requires them to have these additional vaccinations.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:02.362]  The chickenpox and the hepatitis B. No, it's not a new law.
[00:40:02.843 --> 00:40:08.608]  It's the state, and as all the states are doing, adding, in some cases, 10 new vaccines a year.
[00:40:08.648 --> 00:40:10.570]  We've gone from 30 to 40-something.
[00:40:10.610 --> 00:40:12.351]  Now some states, 50-something shots.
[00:40:12.491 --> 00:40:15.834]  On average, it's about 10 a year that they're adding.
[00:40:16.575 --> 00:40:18.637]  My goodness, in 10 years, it'll be in the hundreds.
[00:40:19.509 --> 00:40:20.769]  And don't think they won't stop.
[00:40:21.029 --> 00:40:24.110]  And now they're talking about how we're trying to get around it, so they want to put it in our food.
[00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.271]  Bioengineered food for our own good.
[00:40:26.291 --> 00:40:33.353]  You know, the Africans are refusing to take their shots, so we're going to put it in the potatoes and in the other foods, you know, because they know best.
[00:40:33.373 --> 00:40:40.375]  So see, there's the spin, holding out the color of law with deception that, oh, there's a new law, that's why you got to take it.
[00:40:41.495 --> 00:40:42.456]  There's no new law.
[00:40:42.496 --> 00:40:44.716]  We have the state attorney on who's in this newscast.
[00:40:46.137 --> 00:40:46.797]  You just heard him.
[00:40:48.570 --> 00:40:50.651]  I'm not doing this the hard way or the easy way.
[00:40:52.112 --> 00:40:54.154]  And then he doesn't even vaccinate his own children.
[00:40:54.194 --> 00:40:54.634]  Back to it.
[00:40:55.395 --> 00:41:00.618]  Parents who don't show up in court and who don't comply could end up fined or in jail.
[00:41:01.038 --> 00:41:03.240]  I don't think I should have came to that in the first place.
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.781]  You know as a parent that you give me the shots.
[00:41:06.202 --> 00:41:10.725]  Those that are immunized and those that aren't could pass on some diseases.
[00:41:12.173 --> 00:41:22.916]  Now, it may seem unusual for children to be immunized by court order, but the Supreme Court has actually ruled on this very issue more than a hundred years ago with smallpox.
[00:41:22.936 --> 00:41:24.036]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:41:25.857 --> 00:41:29.198]  Again, this court order isn't about how they have to be inoculated.
[00:41:29.498 --> 00:41:33.599]  This is a court order for truancy, as you heard the state attorney who called them in on this.
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.920]  Do you see the spin?
[00:41:38.863 --> 00:41:42.746]  It's not unusual to have children forcibly injected.
[00:41:43.747 --> 00:41:45.508]  It's an old law.
[00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:50.532]  I mean, just... They just keep repeating the lie over and over again.
[00:41:50.572 --> 00:41:50.872]  Back to it.
[00:41:50.892 --> 00:41:59.159]  The school system says they do make exemptions for religious purposes or other medical reasons, but you have to apply for that exemption.
[00:41:59.459 --> 00:42:05.424]  Now, if parents do not show up in court, they could face a $50 fine and up to 10 days in jail.
[00:42:05.704 --> 00:42:06.645]  We're live in Forestville.
[00:42:06.685 --> 00:42:07.886]  Sherri Lee, Fox 5 News.
[00:42:10.342 --> 00:42:12.386]  Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:15.693]  That is how the deception works.
[00:42:15.734 --> 00:42:17.076]  Now, here is the MSNBC piece.
[00:42:24.437 --> 00:42:26.657]  Well, get your shot or you're out of luck.
[00:42:26.737 --> 00:42:33.659]  That is the message one suburban Maryland county is sending to parents who have failed to get their children vaccinated for hepatitis B as well as chickenpox.
[00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:43.980]  More than 2,000 school-age children have not received mandatory vaccines, and now the county is going to fine their parents, even threatening jail time, if they don't comply.
[00:42:44.781 --> 00:42:51.262]  Barbara Lowe Fisher, co-founder of the National Vaccine Information Center, and Dr. Donald Schell is a health officer for Prince George's County, Maryland.
[00:42:51.282 --> 00:42:52.282]  Thank you both for being with us.
[00:42:53.862 --> 00:42:54.883]  So, Dr. Shull, I'm serious.
[00:42:54.923 --> 00:43:02.226]  Have you seen a problem like this in your county before, or is this year just so much worse in terms of compliance that these measures were necessary?
[00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:10.309]  Well, I believe the measures were necessary because of new vaccination requirements from the state of Maryland.
[00:43:11.029 --> 00:43:19.893]  Since 2002, the addition of the chickenpox and varicella vaccinations required students to have additional vaccines that weren't necessary before.
[00:43:20.453 --> 00:43:25.094]  Barbara, is there a reason why these vaccines shouldn't be allowed to be optional?
[00:43:25.454 --> 00:43:30.536]  Well, I think threatening parents with jail time for not getting a child a chicken pox shot is really overreaching.
[00:43:30.576 --> 00:43:39.998]  And I think whenever the state uses fear and intimidation to threaten parents and force them to do what they want them to do, parents then distrust and fear public health officials.
[00:43:40.018 --> 00:43:42.519]  These vaccines for hepatitis B and chicken pox
[00:43:42.959 --> 00:43:45.721]  Are very different from the diseases we used to vaccinate for.
[00:43:45.781 --> 00:43:47.442]  I mean, chicken pox is not smallpox.
[00:43:47.722 --> 00:43:49.203]  Hepatitis B is not polio.
[00:43:49.523 --> 00:43:55.206]  So these new vaccines that we're now, you know, adding to the mandatory list fall into a very different category.
[00:43:55.626 --> 00:43:56.707]  Dr. Schill, how do you respond to that?
[00:43:56.727 --> 00:44:00.969]  Because I'm sure you've heard the very same thing from some parents who are probably pretty upset about this threat.
[00:44:02.805 --> 00:44:03.385]  Yeah, we do.
[00:44:03.485 --> 00:44:03.785]  We do.
[00:44:03.825 --> 00:44:11.367]  We know from a public health perspective that approximately 40 children a year would die before the vaccinations were mandatory for chickenpox.
[00:44:11.387 --> 00:44:12.447]  Alright, let's stop right there.
[00:44:12.807 --> 00:44:16.408]  Can you imagine how many people die from the vaccines?
[00:44:16.508 --> 00:44:21.229]  I mean, they have a multi-billion dollar federal fund admitting thousands die a year from the shots.
[00:44:22.329 --> 00:44:25.770]  I mean, it's more than 20 people died from the HPV shot now.
[00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:26.790]  Within weeks it was 4.
[00:44:28.531 --> 00:44:29.231]  Earlier this year.
[00:44:30.603 --> 00:44:35.467]  And then they have horrible autoimmune responses, and literally it's like Ebola or something.
[00:44:35.487 --> 00:44:36.267]  They just bleed out.
[00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:47.355]  And just listen how they keep saying, it's the law, it's the law, it's the law, and even the lady they have on there, quote, from the other side, who's saying this is all bad, isn't saying there's no law.
[00:44:48.656 --> 00:44:50.518]  She's just saying, oh, it's terrible, they're forcing them.
[00:44:51.158 --> 00:44:57.823]  And see, so all over TV, CNN, MSNBC, everywhere, this was all over the news this weekend, they are
[00:44:58.926 --> 00:45:01.589]  Sending out the message that vaccines are the law!
[00:45:03.171 --> 00:45:16.745]  I forgot to tell you to get this, John, but if you go to PrisonPlanet.com and you go to the News in Focus section, it says Attorney, no law mandates vaccines, and you scroll down,
[00:45:18.153 --> 00:45:20.674]  There's a clip there that says State Attorney Glenn Ivey.
[00:45:21.015 --> 00:45:22.255]  Click here to listen to the interview.
[00:45:22.275 --> 00:45:23.176]  It's about halfway down.
[00:45:23.296 --> 00:45:25.857]  John, a minute in is when I introduce him.
[00:45:25.937 --> 00:45:29.879]  I want to play that coming up before the shower ends for people that just tuned in.
[00:45:30.859 --> 00:45:34.101]  I want you to hear him say there's no law for these vaccines.
[00:45:34.421 --> 00:45:40.784]  And then he triggered truancy enforcement, which the school itself triggered by kicking him out for not taking the shots.
[00:45:43.342 --> 00:45:44.242]  This is unbelievable.
[00:45:44.642 --> 00:45:46.623]  This is absolutely unbelievable.
[00:45:47.003 --> 00:45:52.104]  This is like they have schools around the country expel you and some have criminal charges.
[00:45:52.144 --> 00:45:52.804]  That's been in the news.
[00:45:52.844 --> 00:45:58.245]  If you play tag or dodgeball or if you run at recess, it's called aggressive or violent.
[00:45:59.845 --> 00:46:06.547]  Or if you have a Tylenol that mommy sent with you to school because you have a headache for allergies or whatever, you can pull all these up.
[00:46:06.567 --> 00:46:07.647]  Hundreds of cases we know of.
[00:46:08.621 --> 00:46:13.247]  That'd be like if they expelled you for a week for that and then charged you with fluency.
[00:46:13.608 --> 00:46:15.170]  State law says you can't do that.
[00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:16.572]  At least I know that in Texas.
[00:46:17.754 --> 00:46:25.364]  Because we've dealt with these cases and covered them years ago with the ASAP, Absent Student Assistance Program, here in Austin.
[00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:40.588]  And that's where you would be not at school for three hours and they would send the constables to your house demanding and sometimes busting in the house and then charging you a truancy when state law said 14 unexcused truancies in a semester.
[00:46:41.188 --> 00:46:50.734]  So it wasn't even state law, we went down to the county and said, state law says this, why are you showing up at people's houses when the kid's sick and the parents forgot to call?
[00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:53.876]  And then charging them a truancy for one absence.
[00:46:55.317 --> 00:46:55.858]  State law says 14.
[00:46:58.385 --> 00:47:00.286]  See, I've dealt with this.
[00:47:00.646 --> 00:47:01.286]  I've learned.
[00:47:01.806 --> 00:47:06.288]  There are thousands of people in every major state in jail who didn't even break a law.
[00:47:09.289 --> 00:47:14.850]  But the juries are so dumb, and most people just plea bargain, they send you to jail all day for not even violating crimes.
[00:47:19.872 --> 00:47:20.912]  I'm not going to play any more of it.
[00:47:20.952 --> 00:47:22.493]  We've got Kellyanne Davis
[00:47:23.168 --> 00:47:23.549]  I think so.
[00:47:36.966 --> 00:47:42.030]  Well, they told the parents, we don't care if you claim we've messed up the shot record and you even had it.
[00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.732]  We're lining you up again, despite your medical background or anything else.
[00:47:45.992 --> 00:47:47.854]  And they thought they were there being forced.
[00:47:48.614 --> 00:47:50.816]  Kelly was there and even videotaped some of this.
[00:47:50.836 --> 00:47:53.397]  Some of the videos are up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:47:53.738 --> 00:47:56.279]  Kelly, I had you on yesterday, but I appreciate you coming on now.
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:02.584]  If you could just as simply as possible give people a synopsis of what you witnessed at the courthouse.
[00:48:04.148 --> 00:48:16.299]  There in Maryland, in this major county of 850,000 people, and Mr. Ivey being there, and break down everything you witnessed, and this incredible science fiction style color of law criminal coercion.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.461]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[00:48:19.601 --> 00:48:24.706]  Listen, first off, right off the bat, I just want to say, make it very clear that I'm just speaking on behalf of myself and my son.
[00:48:24.806 --> 00:48:29.610]  So I'm a voice of two right now, but I would be more than happy to tell you what happened on Saturday.
[00:48:30.596 --> 00:48:33.057]  Pretty basically, I went down there on Saturday.
[00:48:33.537 --> 00:48:36.658]  Before that, a couple of days before that, of course, the story was breaking.
[00:48:37.519 --> 00:48:42.300]  And my son has autism and our community is pretty cohesive.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:43.961]  We send out emails to each other.
[00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:45.561]  So we knew what was going on.
[00:48:46.262 --> 00:48:59.186]  So I tried to contact his office, left messages, and then when I did get in touch with his office, trying to get more information, I was told they would not even tell me what time the hearing would start.
[00:48:59.727 --> 00:49:01.248]  They hung up on me numerous times.
[00:49:01.328 --> 00:49:03.290]  I kept calling back saying, what time does the hearing start?
[00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:04.410]  And they'd hang up on me.
[00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:05.491]  So I said, okay, fine.
[00:49:05.511 --> 00:49:06.912]  I'm going to go to the autism community.
[00:49:06.952 --> 00:49:11.876]  So I sent out an alert to one of my friends who sent it out to other people.
[00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:13.817]  Of course, just kind of snowballed from there.
[00:49:14.197 --> 00:49:15.298]  I'm sure they probably got
[00:49:15.942 --> 00:49:23.044]  Um, you know, hundreds of calls, emails, not just from our community, but there's a lot of people who are concerned about this, this whole situation.
[00:49:23.424 --> 00:49:26.965]  The, um, as you well know, the, uh, uh, what is it?
[00:49:26.985 --> 00:49:29.486]  American Physicians and Surgeons, a group of doctors.
[00:49:29.606 --> 00:49:34.527]  Yeah, second largest, uh, surgeons, um, uh, medical, uh, worker organization in the country.
[00:49:35.147 --> 00:49:35.467]  Awesome.
[00:49:35.487 --> 00:49:35.687]  Yes.
[00:49:35.707 --> 00:49:38.288]  They, so, you know, it wasn't just our, our community.
[00:49:38.408 --> 00:49:41.329]  Um, there are a lot of different communities that are very upset about this.
[00:49:42.462 --> 00:49:54.428]  Needless to say, after a lot of phone calls, after your radio interview with the state attorney, I happened to be listening to it on a link someone had sent me, I had just finished it, and lo and behold, five minutes later, he calls me on my cell phone.
[00:49:54.908 --> 00:50:10.455]  And so we talked for a little bit, and he pretty much told me that he was agnostic concerning the shots, that he just pretty much wanted parents to either fish or cut bait, and so either, you know, fill out the paperwork or do the exemption, and that's pretty much, you know, the schools wanted their paperwork.
[00:50:11.829 --> 00:50:14.990]  We, um, he gave me a cell number to contact him on Saturday.
[00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:15.910]  And this is the big news!
[00:50:16.070 --> 00:50:17.751]  When you got there, that wasn't the case.
[00:50:17.811 --> 00:50:19.332]  See, this is very snake-like.
[00:50:19.912 --> 00:50:21.072]  Well, that's what's interesting.
[00:50:21.112 --> 00:50:26.614]  What's interesting, and I really believe if we'd come in the right way, we would have never gotten in that building, because I heard later,
[00:50:27.014 --> 00:50:30.897]  That they were checking driver's licenses to make sure that you were a resident of Maryland.
[00:50:31.037 --> 00:50:31.617]  And see, I'm not.
[00:50:31.657 --> 00:50:36.461]  I live in D.C., which is just, you know, outside of Maryland where this is all happening.
[00:50:36.921 --> 00:50:39.403]  So we came in a completely different entrance.
[00:50:39.463 --> 00:50:41.985]  I mean, it was like nobody was around.
[00:50:42.605 --> 00:50:43.145]  Now, stay there.
[00:50:43.165 --> 00:50:46.588]  When we get back, Kelly, Ann Davis, we're going to talk about this.
[00:50:46.608 --> 00:50:49.670]  And we've had other witnesses that I've talked to who've confirmed your story.
[00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.051]  Plus, it's in the Associated Press.
[00:50:51.771 --> 00:50:53.513]  And you were also interviewed there by CNN.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:59.723]  This is big news, ladies and gentlemen, because it goes to the heart of the government engaging in mass deception.
[00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:01.304]  These people thought it was the law.
[00:51:01.885 --> 00:51:03.285]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.305 --> 00:51:05.407]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.127 --> 00:51:10.510]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of government.
[00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:13.812]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[00:51:13.852 --> 00:51:16.093]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.633 --> 00:51:19.035]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.802 --> 00:51:27.130]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.146 --> 00:51:35.128]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.608 --> 00:51:39.089]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.449 --> 00:51:41.990]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.030 --> 00:51:43.190]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.210 --> 00:51:43.970]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:45.051]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.271 --> 00:51:46.031]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.251 --> 00:51:47.371]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:53:01.184 --> 00:53:03.566]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[00:53:04.106 --> 00:53:05.567]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[00:53:05.927 --> 00:53:09.750]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:12.391]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:53:12.812 --> 00:53:16.154]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:53:16.554 --> 00:53:19.016]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:53:19.516 --> 00:53:20.557]  What's that name again?
[00:53:20.577 --> 00:53:22.138]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:53:22.538 --> 00:53:23.699]  It's CalX.
[00:53:24.099 --> 00:53:25.940]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:53:26.301 --> 00:53:28.142]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[00:53:28.914 --> 00:53:37.536]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:53:37.956 --> 00:53:43.678]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:53:44.078 --> 00:53:55.201]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:53:55.862 --> 00:53:56.963]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[00:53:57.304 --> 00:53:57.964]  I'll be right back.
[00:53:58.104 --> 00:53:59.786]  I'm getting some cowlicks for my heels.
[00:54:12.221 --> 00:54:16.063]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:54:16.363 --> 00:54:21.766]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:54:21.806 --> 00:54:24.488]  We fired our guns and the British kept for coming.
[00:54:24.508 --> 00:54:26.929]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:54:26.969 --> 00:54:32.213]  We fired once more and they began to run down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:42.523]  Kellyanne Davis, eyewitness, and what she's reported to us has been confirmed by others and the mainstream news even admits it.
[00:55:02.091 --> 00:55:10.213]  Like cattle herded in there, believing they were being forcibly inoculated so they, quote, wouldn't go to jail, begging them, saying, hey, we even have our shock records.
[00:55:10.633 --> 00:55:11.934]  We even submitted to you.
[00:55:12.334 --> 00:55:13.414]  They thought it was a law.
[00:55:13.654 --> 00:55:16.555]  The newscast all repeating it was a law over and over again.
[00:55:17.575 --> 00:55:20.536]  Coming up, we're going to play Glenn Ivey, the state attorney saying there isn't a law.
[00:55:21.957 --> 00:55:35.629]  So you talked to Ivy on the phone, as many others did, and he said, oh no, he said on this show, we're going to let them know that there is a waiver and they don't have to, hey, fish or cut bait, you know, just do something, do the waiver or don't do it, you know, or get the shots.
[00:55:36.970 --> 00:55:37.890]  But that's not the case.
[00:55:37.931 --> 00:55:38.651]  You were there.
[00:55:38.671 --> 00:55:40.753]  Mrs. Davis, please continue.
[00:55:41.534 --> 00:55:43.936]  Okay, so we went through this back doorway.
[00:55:44.076 --> 00:55:45.077]  No one in the hallways.
[00:55:45.117 --> 00:55:46.698]  We didn't even know where to go because it was bad.
[00:55:46.718 --> 00:55:47.638]  There was just nobody around.
[00:55:47.698 --> 00:55:54.003]  So we saw somebody in the hallway, like one of the people who worked at the courthouse said, where is this, you know, where everybody's supposed to be going?
[00:55:54.023 --> 00:55:54.703]  They said, oh, that way.
[00:55:54.743 --> 00:55:55.464]  So we went down.
[00:55:55.784 --> 00:55:57.225]  There were these huge double doors.
[00:55:57.265 --> 00:55:58.706]  I mean, we didn't even hear anything at this point.
[00:55:58.726 --> 00:55:59.987]  So we're like, where is everybody?
[00:56:00.487 --> 00:56:04.849]  So we opened these doors and then we're in this room where there's like several hundred people.
[00:56:04.969 --> 00:56:08.551]  I mean, people didn't even notice us because there were so many people in this room.
[00:56:08.891 --> 00:56:11.132]  We're like, whoa, we came in the wrong door.
[00:56:11.572 --> 00:56:15.494]  So we were inside, so we started scoping out what was going on.
[00:56:16.074 --> 00:56:36.487]  And so we asked an official there, and she just thought I was a parent, you know, with one of the kids there, and so I asked her what was going on, and she told me the people were coming in, then they would get these packets that were already paper clipped together, they would take the packet, they'd go down the hallway, a nurse would help fill them, you know, help them fill it out, then they would get back in a line, and then they would be taken to get their shots.
[00:56:36.947 --> 00:56:37.828]  So I said, okay, thank you.
[00:56:38.633 --> 00:56:48.701]  And we hadn't even gone into the main area where everybody was, and the gentleman who was with me, a good friend of mine, Jim, he saw a little wooden table outside where everybody else was.
[00:56:48.721 --> 00:56:50.002]  It was, like, in the back of the room.
[00:56:50.322 --> 00:56:52.584]  And he says, oh, here's the exemption form.
[00:56:52.604 --> 00:56:54.745]  And it was just sitting in a little pile on this table.
[00:56:54.985 --> 00:56:58.448]  But separately, because you said the court was, like, divided up as courts often are.
[00:56:58.688 --> 00:57:04.993]  It was, like, well, Alex, it was, like, the main lobby room, and if you can just imagine, it was, like, in a rectangular shape.
[00:57:05.033 --> 00:57:07.815]  So just, like, if you're looking at coming in, and it's your twelve o'clock position,
[00:57:08.195 --> 00:57:10.217]  Just think of it like an open rectangle.
[00:57:10.257 --> 00:57:14.199]  So it's like on the left side, and then at the back, and then on the right side, there's like tables.
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:22.605]  But behind that, at the 12 o'clock position, behind that, nobody was going in that area because they were all kind of contained within this rectangle.
[00:57:23.106 --> 00:57:35.314]  Behind that is where we came in over from the right on the 1 o'clock position, and we walked in the back, and there was a little wooden table, and there was a little stack of forms, and Jim had pulled the one and said, this is the form.
[00:57:35.354 --> 00:57:36.635]  Now here's the important part.
[00:57:37.102 --> 00:57:46.432]  The form is the exact same one that we made copies of because we had known that we didn't think that they were going to tell them about it.
[00:57:46.513 --> 00:57:47.353]  And this is the key.
[00:57:47.374 --> 00:57:49.496]  You went and got the actual package.
[00:57:49.936 --> 00:57:51.138]  I have it in my hand.
[00:57:51.198 --> 00:57:52.439]  It's like a different texture thickness.
[00:57:54.401 --> 00:57:59.623]  We have the exact same, we make copies of the exact same form, so obviously I know what it looks like.
[00:57:59.703 --> 00:58:07.245]  Okay, the point is though, you went, the key, the key, the key, the key here, is that you then went and got the packet they were giving the people, and it didn't have it in it.
[00:58:07.265 --> 00:58:07.965]  Right.
[00:58:07.985 --> 00:58:11.806]  Put my glasses on, and I carefully looked through it, because I already knew what it looked like.
[00:58:12.107 --> 00:58:15.948]  And I looked through and made sure on the bottom, because that's usually where they place it, looked through all the forms.
[00:58:16.108 --> 00:58:18.449]  One of the forms was like, the manufacturer line.
[00:58:18.469 --> 00:58:19.789]  Tell them, tell them, tell them what you saw.
[00:58:20.582 --> 00:58:31.810]  One of the forms, I'm trying to remember, but one of the forms had the manufacturer's lot, one of the forms had the place for the immunizations, but it didn't have the bottom part that has the exemption part on it, okay?
[00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:34.552]  I know what that form looks like, because we made a hundred of them.
[00:58:34.572 --> 00:58:34.812]  I understand.
[00:58:34.832 --> 00:58:35.212]  Stay there.
[00:58:35.232 --> 00:58:36.513]  We're going to come right back to you.
[00:58:36.533 --> 00:58:37.894]  Let's just get the basic facts out.
[00:58:37.914 --> 00:58:38.295]  Here we go.
[00:58:38.755 --> 00:58:39.676]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:39.696 --> 00:58:43.558]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.299 --> 00:59:01.502]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.123 --> 00:59:02.944]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.724 --> 00:59:04.665]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.265 --> 00:59:08.928]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.469 --> 00:59:13.532]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.078 --> 00:59:25.562]  I have the school's letter that they sent out.
[00:59:25.582 --> 00:59:28.045]  We're going to get this to Paul Watson for an article later.
[00:59:28.065 --> 00:59:35.236]  From Prince George County in Maryland, suburb of D.C., and it doesn't say anywhere that there is a waiver.
[00:59:35.777 --> 00:59:36.878]  So here's the proof right here.
[00:59:36.938 --> 00:59:39.342]  They sent a letter out saying they had to take it and there was no waiver.
[00:59:40.394 --> 00:59:46.317]  The lady we're talking to, Kellyanne Davis, went and covered all this because she's an activist.
[00:59:46.337 --> 00:59:54.160]  Her son was damaged by vaccines, got autism from it, and she went in behind an area where they couldn't get to it, but they came in through another door.
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:55.661]  There were the vaccine waiver forms.
[00:59:55.981 --> 00:59:56.962]  This is the key.
[00:59:57.002 --> 00:59:58.322]  They were able to get the packets.
[00:59:58.683 --> 00:59:59.683]  They were giving the parents.
[00:59:59.803 --> 01:00:01.724]  It didn't have anything about the vaccine waiver form.
[01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:05.726]  Unfortunately, but hindsight's 20-20, she's done a great job.
[01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:08.247]  She gave that to the local Fox reporter.
[01:00:08.727 --> 01:00:09.188]  We're good to go.
[01:00:31.909 --> 01:00:35.670]  And the point is, there's now an alternative media that will counter this and cover this.
[01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:40.492]  Who did you get the actual packets from that they were actually giving the parents?
[01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:41.392]  Tell us about that, Kelly.
[01:00:41.952 --> 01:00:45.613]  I just walked up to the table and I said, can I have one of those packets?
[01:00:45.673 --> 01:00:46.634]  And she said, are you a parent?
[01:00:46.654 --> 01:00:47.954]  And I said, yes, because I am a parent.
[01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:49.375]  So she gave me the packet.
[01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:53.196]  We looked at it quickly, saw that the immunization form was not there.
[01:00:53.736 --> 01:01:10.262]  And we walked outside where all the news people were and of course the line had dwindled down but it was still a little bit out the door and we walked outside and we went up and I introduced myself to Glenn and we just started asking him about why the immunization forms were not in the packet.
[01:01:10.282 --> 01:01:21.086]  I have it in my hand as I was in front of the CNN cameras and you have that clip and even the gentleman I was with, Jim Moody, brought up the safety issue and the CNN reporter asked
[01:01:21.607 --> 01:01:23.287]  Glenn, well, what do you think about that?
[01:01:23.407 --> 01:01:29.289]  And he even, you know, he kind of concurred with Jim, saying, you know, we should have the option.
[01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:34.970]  And he said that's what she was bringing up to our attention, is that the forms were not with the packets, and so we're going to correct that.
[01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:36.531]  That's in that clip right there.
[01:01:37.391 --> 01:01:38.971]  That's a CNN clip that I sent you.
[01:01:40.412 --> 01:01:41.192]  And we've got that clip.
[01:01:41.212 --> 01:01:42.672]  We're going to play that coming up.
[01:01:43.292 --> 01:01:45.113]  Again, I just got this from a parent.
[01:01:46.478 --> 01:01:58.632]  Uh, actually this is a direct link to the Prince George County School District, and they say here that you have to come in and take the shot and imply it's the law and say nothing about waivers.
[01:01:58.692 --> 01:02:01.055]  So we have them red-handed right here.
[01:02:01.976 --> 01:02:02.196]  Right.
[01:02:02.797 --> 01:02:05.159]  And in the video that you have on YouTube,
[01:02:06.045 --> 01:02:09.866]  Um, the school official was trying to, um, contradict me in that video.
[01:02:09.886 --> 01:02:14.147]  You see me talking to him, and I was talking about the press release, and he was saying it was just the announcement.
[01:02:14.227 --> 01:02:20.608]  And I was trying to tell him, but it has all of, you know, you will be reprimanded, your child will be immunized on the site.
[01:02:20.968 --> 01:02:22.588]  It has all of that in there.
[01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:31.150]  Yeah, you're going to get in trouble and maybe spend ten days in jail because we're a pack of liars, engaging in fraud, uh, trying to make you take injections.
[01:02:31.843 --> 01:02:33.364]  Yeah, they were not being transparent.
[01:02:33.384 --> 01:02:35.606]  Now, then the police state kicked in, though.
[01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:38.468]  When we get back, I want you to tell people about that, but go ahead and start.
[01:02:39.509 --> 01:02:46.714]  That's the part, you know, I mean, I gotta tell you, Alex, I, you know, I go to a lot of meetings, I set up a lot of meetings, I'm very level-headed, you know, diplomatic.
[01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:58.755]  But I'll tell you, when you start having the state start forcing parents to inject what I believe injured my child, and there's thousands of other parents around the country who believe exactly like I do.
[01:02:58.795 --> 01:02:59.775]  There's no belief about it.
[01:02:59.795 --> 01:03:01.176]  There's thousands of medical studies.
[01:03:01.596 --> 01:03:02.296]  Exactly.
[01:03:02.396 --> 01:03:05.777]  And you're going to inject these children with a neurotoxin and force them to do it?
[01:03:05.817 --> 01:03:07.278]  That's when I start getting really angry.
[01:03:07.358 --> 01:03:15.781]  I mean, ten years ago it was twelve shots, and then it was twenty-five shots, and then thirty-four shots, and now forty-five shots, and some states fifty-five shots.
[01:03:16.061 --> 01:03:17.881]  I mean, is it going to be five million shots?
[01:03:17.942 --> 01:03:23.863]  Just giant children walking and laying down on a bed and a huge, huge robotic system hits them with five thousand needles?
[01:03:24.484 --> 01:03:31.286]  Well, there is a guy out there who advocates on the other side and said that he believes that children can take five thousand shots and be perfectly fine.
[01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:32.326]  Yeah, that's why I said that.
[01:03:32.366 --> 01:03:33.447]  Yeah, the government's pushing it.
[01:03:35.091 --> 01:03:37.473]  Hey, it won't matter if all of us are autistic.
[01:03:37.533 --> 01:03:39.354]  It'll just be like the Matrix.
[01:03:39.374 --> 01:03:43.636]  They'll insert us into little pods and feed off of our energy.
[01:03:43.656 --> 01:03:46.618]  Folks, this is a big deal.
[01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:51.681]  This is mass fraud, totally documented, red-handed.
[01:03:51.742 --> 01:03:52.482]  We have them.
[01:03:53.403 --> 01:03:54.823]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.884 --> 01:03:56.925]  A new world order.
[01:03:57.645 --> 01:04:01.968]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power called God.
[01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:05.320]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.541]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[01:04:08.141 --> 01:04:10.583]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.323 --> 01:04:18.927]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:21.669 --> 01:04:26.632]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.132 --> 01:04:30.614]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:30.974 --> 01:04:33.496]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:33.536 --> 01:04:34.696]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:34.716 --> 01:04:35.457]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.477 --> 01:04:36.557]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:36.778 --> 01:04:37.418]  They're after power.
[01:04:37.438 --> 01:04:38.539]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:06:52.817 --> 01:06:58.579]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.019 --> 01:07:05.621]  Coming up later in the show, we're going to give you the Zogby poll that we commissioned.
[01:07:05.641 --> 01:07:06.741]  We did it fairly.
[01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:14.283]  If we were wanting to get Ron Paul high numbers, we would have asked, we would have given his bio first, told people about him.
[01:07:14.303 --> 01:07:16.744]  That's what they do for Romney and Giuliani.
[01:07:16.764 --> 01:07:20.625]  We've got separate polls from Gallup polls, Zogby and others doing that.
[01:07:21.423 --> 01:07:23.109]  Which they've commissioned, of course, themselves.
[01:07:23.903 --> 01:07:28.726]  We would have asked those questions first, introduced him, gotten people to like him, and then ask questions.
[01:07:28.746 --> 01:07:29.406]  We didn't do that.
[01:07:29.446 --> 01:07:32.548]  We head-to-head, just asked about the different individuals.
[01:07:32.748 --> 01:07:41.532]  Then, in a blind poll, we gave the policies of the candidates, and Ron Paul won by a massive margin.
[01:07:41.592 --> 01:07:43.313]  So, here's the headline.
[01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:52.458]  In a national, scientifically conducted poll, and by the way, we had them go at hardline Republicans that aren't on YouTube, we even have that in the question, that aren't in
[01:07:54.022 --> 01:08:03.870]  MySpace, Ron Paul's core, you know, young people, the Internet, and Libertarians, in mainline Republicans and Democrats.
[01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:05.651]  But it was skewed toward Republicans.
[01:08:05.691 --> 01:08:07.513]  That's who they tried to get to answer most of the questions.
[01:08:08.533 --> 01:08:11.756]  Ron Paul won two major areas of the poll.
[01:08:13.397 --> 01:08:16.620]  And I'm trying to digest this during the breaks.
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:17.500]  There's so much more going on.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.861]  We'll go back to our guests in just a minute.
[01:08:19.642 --> 01:08:20.743]  By the way, this poll did cost $4,500.
[01:08:24.082 --> 01:08:27.083]  And now it looks like if we want Zogby to publish it, it's more money.
[01:08:27.183 --> 01:08:30.545]  But whatever, we've got it and we can publish it and we'll probably just pay the money.
[01:08:30.585 --> 01:08:31.625]  The money means nothing to me.
[01:08:33.246 --> 01:08:36.527]  Literally, it's fuel in my X-Wing in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:08:37.498 --> 01:08:42.062]  And I hope you will continue to support us, plus get the most powerful films out there, bar none.
[01:08:42.482 --> 01:08:47.387]  Loose Change Final Cut, now available on DVD, a whole new film, the preeminent 9-11 video.
[01:08:47.987 --> 01:08:50.769]  Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, is now out on DVD.
[01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.411]  Huge discounts on Endgame.
[01:08:52.431 --> 01:08:57.055]  You can get it discounted when you get Loose Change for the regular price, you can get Endgame discounted.
[01:08:57.795 --> 01:09:01.236]  The music of Endgame and Terrorstorm with audio clips of myself speaking.
[01:09:01.616 --> 01:09:02.477]  Very powerful.
[01:09:02.557 --> 01:09:03.317]  That's available for $9.95.
[01:09:03.997 --> 01:09:06.298]  9-11 Inside Job T-shirts for $9.95.
[01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:07.819]  Ball caps for $6.95.
[01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.159]  That's like a dollar more than they cost us.
[01:09:10.619 --> 01:09:13.560]  It's all about getting the information out.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:23.384]  And when we get extra capital in here, folks, we spend it on more webmasters, on more information, on more better cameras, on Zogby polls, on Ron Paul video contests.
[01:09:23.824 --> 01:09:25.845]  We are in combat mode.
[01:09:25.885 --> 01:09:26.825]  It's all ammo.

[01:10:51.306 --> 01:11:00.711]  Next Tuesday, or Wednesday the 28th, we're going to launch in-game 1.5.
[01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:12.576]  Over an hour and ten minutes of extra interviews, things that happened in Istanbul, things that happened in Ottawa with the Bilderberg Group, interviews,
[01:11:13.610 --> 01:11:15.831]  So much more really powerful info.
[01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.192]  We couldn't have the film be five hours long, so we had to cut a lot.
[01:11:18.552 --> 01:11:20.513]  Well, an hour and ten minutes at least.
[01:11:20.553 --> 01:11:21.433]  We may even put more up.
[01:11:21.893 --> 01:11:28.196]  Endgame 1.5 coming up the 28th for PrisonPlanet.tv members exclusively.
[01:11:28.656 --> 01:11:31.617]  So get your PrisonPlanet.tv membership or give it as a gift.
[01:11:32.037 --> 01:11:32.558]  Email somebody.

[01:11:34.138 --> 01:11:35.159]  Takes about a minute and a half.
[01:11:35.179 --> 01:11:36.679]  With PayPal or credit card.
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.480]  Get a
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:41.421]  Membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:41.681 --> 01:11:44.701]  If you already have one, go get another $5.95 trial membership.
[01:11:45.342 --> 01:11:46.122]  A monthly membership.
[01:11:46.442 --> 01:11:49.783]  And then send somebody, say, here's your passcode, and here's your username.
[01:11:50.303 --> 01:11:56.144]  You just go type it into the box on the website, and they'll watch thousands of videos and clips, download them, burn them to disk, whatever.
[01:11:57.925 --> 01:11:59.765]  Send them the code, a nice little card.
[01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:03.406]  Get the code yourself, write it down, and mail it to them.
[01:12:03.486 --> 01:12:03.946]  Whatever.
[01:12:04.947 --> 01:12:05.727]  The point is,
[01:12:07.253 --> 01:12:10.135]  You get powerful information, and it makes what we're doing here possible.
[01:12:10.955 --> 01:12:13.156]  I think I'm going to do another scientific study.
[01:12:13.196 --> 01:12:17.659]  This poll, you can call it fair, but by the time they got done with it, it really leaned against Ron Paul, but he still won.
[01:12:18.259 --> 01:12:23.742]  I think I'm going to copy a Mitt Romney or Giuliani poll, but change it around for Ron Paul now.
[01:12:24.422 --> 01:12:27.084]  And I'm going to use another mainline scientific polling company.
[01:12:27.644 --> 01:12:29.385]  Mason, Dixon, Gallup, something like that.
[01:12:29.565 --> 01:12:30.246]  Angus and Reed.
[01:12:31.206 --> 01:12:32.527]  And if I get the money in.
[01:12:33.832 --> 01:12:39.696]  And I want to give people Christmas bonuses and maybe better polls, but I can't help myself.
[01:12:41.177 --> 01:12:43.198]  And I think we may do a skewed poll.
[01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:44.959]  And even write about it.
[01:12:45.219 --> 01:12:46.040]  This one isn't.
[01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:49.142]  This one, frankly, leans against Paul.
[01:12:49.522 --> 01:12:52.024]  I tried to make it fair, but looking at it now, it's not.
[01:12:52.444 --> 01:12:53.104]  He's still won.
[01:12:53.725 --> 01:13:00.129]  I think I'm going to do a skewed poll and show you him win by 60 plus percent, not 34 percent.
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:05.882]  I think I'm going to do that.
[01:13:08.606 --> 01:13:10.488]  As a scientific study to show you.
[01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:14.713]  I thought we'd get results like this and we'd get a fair poll and we did.
[01:13:15.494 --> 01:13:16.074]  We did.
[01:13:16.094 --> 01:13:19.658]  I'm sorry, our guest is holding.
[01:13:19.698 --> 01:13:21.821]  I'm already getting off into other subjects.
[01:13:21.861 --> 01:13:22.542]  I'm just so excited.
[01:13:23.783 --> 01:13:27.526]  We're going to go back to her in just a moment and I appreciate Kellyanne Davis for joining us.
[01:13:27.646 --> 01:13:33.831]  Let me just read to you if there's any doubt what Prince George County Public Schools sent out in an email and in a mail letter.
[01:13:33.851 --> 01:13:50.323]  This is from their website www.1.pgcps.org forward slash work area forward slash showcontent.aspx question mark ID equals 30952.
[01:13:55.367 --> 01:13:56.007]  Now listen to this.
[01:13:56.047 --> 01:14:06.051]  This is them premeditatedly telling people they have to come do it, but it shows they did it all in legalese to do everything they could to imply it was the law when it isn't.
[01:14:06.651 --> 01:14:08.111]  This shows massive deception.
[01:14:08.171 --> 01:14:08.672]  Listen to this.
[01:14:10.492 --> 01:14:14.133]  Schools Health Department working together to immunize all school children.
[01:14:15.374 --> 01:14:19.315]  County schools, government go to court to provide children's immunizations.
[01:14:20.315 --> 01:14:24.897]  See they're saying we go to court to rope you in and fool you and color of law you.
[01:14:27.822 --> 01:14:32.767]  Putting the educational and health needs of the children first, Prince George County Public Schools, so they put the children first.
[01:14:33.447 --> 01:14:42.475]  And the County Health Department announced today that parents have been ordered to appear in court so their children can be compliant with state immunization requirements.
[01:14:42.495 --> 01:14:46.339]  See, but they're being called there for being parental because the school kicked them out.
[01:14:46.559 --> 01:14:51.083]  But then they say, no, you're being called to be compliant with state immunization requirements, not a law.
[01:14:52.216 --> 01:14:53.717]  Children should not be deprived.
[01:14:53.997 --> 01:14:55.598]  See, it's not the welfare they care.
[01:14:55.998 --> 01:15:02.462]  Children should not be deprived of an education when our county offers free immunizations, but it's the school that deprived them and kicked them out.
[01:15:03.112 --> 01:15:05.153]  This is a public health and children's rights issue.
[01:15:05.233 --> 01:15:06.054]  Oh, it's the rights.
[01:15:06.114 --> 01:15:07.214]  They're fighting for their rights.
[01:15:07.614 --> 01:15:08.995]  That we are determined to correct.
[01:15:09.055 --> 01:15:18.380]  Oh, they're going to correct it, said Board of Education Chair R. Owen Johnson, Jr., who made the announcement today outside the circuit court of Prince George County.
[01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:20.621]  Children need to be in school to learn.
[01:15:20.661 --> 01:15:21.462]  Well, why'd you kick them out?
[01:15:21.942 --> 01:15:28.865]  Every day they are not permitted to attend school by you because they have not received their vaccinations is a missed opportunity.
[01:15:29.306 --> 01:15:29.686]  By you!
[01:15:30.752 --> 01:15:39.720]  On Saturday, November 17, 2007, the first of a series of hearings will be held in the Circuit Court of Prince George County, 14735 Main Street, Upper Marlborough.
[01:15:40.321 --> 01:15:49.849]  Parents will appear with 1,671 children who will receive needed vaccinations administered by the Prince George County Health Department Licensed Health Care Professionals.
[01:15:50.774 --> 01:16:04.583]  Quote, one of the first important things parents can do to protect their children from vaccine-preventable diseases is to make sure their children receive all their immunizations, said Donald Schell, MD, MA Health Officer, working in partnership with our county schools as our goal to provide immunizations to all children in need.
[01:16:04.903 --> 01:16:10.907]  With immunization of children, parents must partner with health departments to authorize, to authorize, see?
[01:16:11.407 --> 01:16:14.869]  You gotta authorize the delivery of services to their child.
[01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:21.218]  But they were there thinking, oh, we're going to be arrested ten days in jail if we don't, and there's no law.
[01:16:22.898 --> 01:16:32.623]  Now, while I still have time, let's play a minute of Mr. Ivey on the show last week admitting that, and by the way, his kids don't take any of that later, that there is no law.
[01:16:32.643 --> 01:16:35.444]  Here it is, and then we'll come back to our guest, Glenn Ivey.
[01:16:35.464 --> 01:16:36.424]  Mr. Ivey, thanks for coming on.
[01:16:36.745 --> 01:16:37.625]  Thanks for having me on.
[01:16:38.425 --> 01:16:39.826]  Tell us in a nutshell what's happening.
[01:16:40.965 --> 01:16:50.447]  Well, we've had, as you pointed out, somewhere in the neighborhood of 2,000 kids who have not gotten all of their shots taken care of, and so they're not able to go to school.
[01:16:51.187 --> 01:17:07.710]  We've tried to do it the easy way with free vaccinations and vaccination days we've done around the county, the school system, the health department, but, you know, we still have a lot of parents that haven't complied, so they asked the court system to help out, and I was willing to step in.
[01:17:09.187 --> 01:17:19.515]  Mr. Ivey, you're a lawyer, and you've also worked as a federal prosecutor, and now you're the state's attorney for Prince George County, a very large populated county.
[01:17:19.855 --> 01:17:20.956]  How many people are in your county?
[01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:23.458]  We're somewhere in the neighborhood of 875,000.
[01:17:23.518 --> 01:17:25.799]  So that's a big county.
[01:17:26.099 --> 01:17:27.040]  Yeah, we are.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.763]  It covers the east side of Washington, D.C.
[01:17:32.344 --> 01:17:34.866]  Now, when you watch this Fox 5 newscast, have you seen that?
[01:17:35.530 --> 01:17:35.970]  I have not.
[01:17:36.651 --> 01:17:49.199]  Well, I mean, they talk about how for not taking the shots they're going to be arrested, but isn't it really that there's no law you have to take the vaccines, but then if you're truant, that's when criminal penalties kick in?
[01:17:49.699 --> 01:17:59.766]  Yeah, there's a statute here in Maryland called Child in Need of Supervision, and I have used it for chronic truancy cases to pressure the parents to get their kids back in school.
[01:18:00.186 --> 01:18:04.789]  We would use that same theory on the vaccinations case.
[01:18:05.529 --> 01:18:19.557]  Well, the reason I got you on, and I appreciate you coming on in a timely fashion, is that you, out of the principals, the teachers, the parents are not ignorant of the law.
[01:18:20.077 --> 01:18:22.839]  Very intelligent and successful individual.
[01:18:23.639 --> 01:18:27.722]  You know this is coercion because there is no law you have to take the shots.
[01:18:27.762 --> 01:18:35.207]  By state and federal law, they're supposed to present them with the waiver form for religious, medical, or other objections.
[01:18:35.607 --> 01:18:44.413]  And that the schools then kick them out wrongly, claiming they can't be there without the shots because they're mandated by the governor and the state as recommended.
[01:18:44.793 --> 01:18:47.535]  And then once the truancy kicks in... We'll come back.
[01:18:47.555 --> 01:18:48.515]  We'll come back with the rest of it.
[01:18:52.998 --> 01:18:59.200]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:07.443]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:07.783 --> 01:19:15.646]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:15.946 --> 01:19:20.688]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:21.028 --> 01:19:25.731]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:26.251 --> 01:19:30.114]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:30.594 --> 01:19:31.615]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:31.695 --> 01:19:35.777]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:19:36.197 --> 01:19:40.580]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:43.602]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:19:44.082 --> 01:19:46.643]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:47.983 --> 01:19:49.743]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:52.444 --> 01:19:54.564]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.985]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:19:58.225 --> 01:20:02.806]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:20:03.186 --> 01:20:05.786]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:20:06.267 --> 01:20:10.667]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run.
[01:20:10.988 --> 01:20:13.008]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:20:13.468 --> 01:20:18.712]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:20:19.133 --> 01:20:20.794]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:20:21.295 --> 01:20:24.597]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:20:25.138 --> 01:20:28.520]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:34.966]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:20:35.906 --> 01:20:41.311]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.

[01:20:52.277 --> 01:20:57.780]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:02.422]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:21:02.862 --> 01:21:09.706]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:21:10.146 --> 01:21:16.848]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:21:17.168 --> 01:21:18.789]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:21:19.089 --> 01:21:22.270]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:21:22.530 --> 01:21:24.991]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:21:25.311 --> 01:21:26.432]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:21:27.572 --> 01:21:28.492]  We're good to go!
[01:21:52.063 --> 01:21:54.404]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[01:21:54.484 --> 01:22:01.008]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[01:22:01.168 --> 01:22:04.249]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[01:22:04.489 --> 01:22:07.631]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[01:22:07.891 --> 01:22:10.553]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:13.014]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.

[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:34.562]  Gardeners, you'll love how much time and money you'll save making your own herbs and spices from your own kitchen.

[01:22:41.944 --> 01:22:42.324]  That's Drawings
[01:22:50.186 --> 01:22:51.407]  One, two, three, dot com.
[01:22:51.427 --> 01:23:05.357]  Ira hates.
[01:23:06.278 --> 01:23:07.599]  Ira hates.
[01:23:12.816 --> 01:23:17.040]  Call him drunk and I will take him.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.001]  All right, Kellyanne Davis is our guest.
[01:23:19.021 --> 01:23:22.104]  You can hear the rest of that interview with Mr. Ivey if you want.
[01:23:22.364 --> 01:23:24.126]  We don't have time to play it all.
[01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:29.446]  But hearing all of that, Kelly, what is it like to know there's no law?
[01:23:29.826 --> 01:23:30.327]  You were there.
[01:23:30.367 --> 01:23:31.688]  The people thought it was the law.
[01:23:31.908 --> 01:23:33.229]  They weren't giving them the waivers.
[01:23:33.549 --> 01:23:35.450]  They thought they'd go to jail if they didn't.
[01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:36.771]  This is a perfect fraud.
[01:23:36.831 --> 01:23:44.657]  I mean, this is mass fraud, official oppression being committed by this county and the health department against these people.
[01:23:45.017 --> 01:23:47.559]  And then how do they behave once they found out who you were?
[01:23:48.679 --> 01:23:51.200]  Well, see, that's what makes me angry, Alex.
[01:23:52.021 --> 01:24:04.666]  As a parent, I'm not going to sit around and watch another parent be forced or pressured, you know, the model of pressure that Glenn was saying, into injecting their children with a vaccine that isn't safe.
[01:24:04.826 --> 01:24:16.671]  I mean, my son was injured by his vaccines and I, you know, me and thousands of other parents are not going to sit back and quietly allow the government to put that kind of pressure tactic on other
[01:24:17.311 --> 01:24:30.364]  But even if you don't have children, folks, they have openly said they have forced inoculation programs for smallpox, anthrax, and a whole litany of different dangerous vaccines if we're quote attacked or during emergencies.
[01:24:31.045 --> 01:24:40.855]  And the whole apparatus of shadow government now is operating under this and Bush signed continual government over to himself and then to the UN this year under the guise of bio-attack.
[01:24:41.195 --> 01:24:43.136]  I mean, they've been gearing up for this for a long time.
[01:24:43.156 --> 01:24:47.438]  This is a very dangerous precedent, and now they've hired tens of thousands of preachers nationwide.
[01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:48.418]  That's been mainstream news.
[01:24:48.678 --> 01:24:50.179]  We broke it before it was mainstream news.
[01:24:50.199 --> 01:24:55.961]  We've got the FEMA documents training preachers to tell their flocks to submit to forced inoculations when there's no law.
[01:24:56.321 --> 01:24:57.622]  I mean, this is out of control!
[01:24:57.642 --> 01:24:59.422]  Yeah, it's out of control.
[01:24:59.763 --> 01:25:03.604]  And the part that was the most, that got me, it kind of surprised me.
[01:25:03.644 --> 01:25:07.966]  It did get me angry on Saturday, and actually my friend had to kind of calm me down.
[01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:20.816]  I wanted to go to the restroom, and this was a couple hours into everything, and of course they knew where I stood on the whole issue, and we'd gone in front of the CNN cameras and held our packet and said, where's the immunization form?
[01:25:20.836 --> 01:25:32.144]  So that had already occurred, and I wanted to go to the restroom, and I don't know if you got to see the video, but I don't look like a thug, at least I don't think I look like a thug, and so I just wanted to go to the bathroom.
[01:25:32.604 --> 01:25:36.968]  And I noticed that Glenn's assistant, Michael, I knew who he was.
[01:25:37.408 --> 01:25:40.230]  He was the guy that had been hanging up on me all the time.
[01:25:40.431 --> 01:25:41.091]  That's Glenn Ivey.
[01:25:41.111 --> 01:25:42.993]  Oh yeah, they wouldn't tell you when it was going to be held.
[01:25:43.113 --> 01:25:44.054]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:44.094 --> 01:25:48.077]  I mean, I don't know why that was top secret, but even Glenn admitted that that was wrong.
[01:25:48.157 --> 01:25:50.879]  You know, they're in the information business, of course, his offices.
[01:25:51.319 --> 01:25:58.445]  So I started walking over there and he was following me and I was pretending like I didn't notice what he was doing, but he was like, you know, like five feet behind me.
[01:25:58.825 --> 01:26:01.748]  So I was going through this and he was saying, well, you know, the courthouse is not open.
[01:26:03.056 --> 01:26:03.696]  To the public right now.
[01:26:03.716 --> 01:26:04.737]  I said, this is a public building.
[01:26:05.057 --> 01:26:07.998]  No, this is a closed, this is not open for the public today.
[01:26:08.018 --> 01:26:10.898]  We're doing you a favor by allowing you to go to the restaurant.
[01:26:10.918 --> 01:26:13.539]  Yeah, just total color, again, more color of law.
[01:26:13.719 --> 01:26:17.980]  You could have been in there filing stuff for a business or for a deed.
[01:26:18.060 --> 01:26:20.101]  Now a public building, they selectively enforce.
[01:26:20.281 --> 01:26:23.302]  Well, if they're selectively claiming there's a law to take shots when they're in, why not?
[01:26:23.542 --> 01:26:24.242]  Why stop there?
[01:26:24.862 --> 01:26:25.263]  Oh, I know.
[01:26:25.303 --> 01:26:28.666]  They were obviously threatened by me for whatever reason.
[01:26:28.706 --> 01:26:30.988]  Now you told me yesterday they also followed you with a dog.
[01:26:31.388 --> 01:26:31.728]  They did.
[01:26:31.748 --> 01:26:32.309]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:26:32.329 --> 01:26:35.712]  So I went through the detectors and they were saying that like right in the lobby area.
[01:26:36.132 --> 01:26:39.175]  So I walked and I was walking and I heard him.
[01:26:39.516 --> 01:26:41.677]  He was talking to the policemen with the dogs.
[01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:42.538]  You saw that in the video.
[01:26:42.558 --> 01:26:44.160]  They were behind me when I was talking.
[01:26:44.620 --> 01:26:45.900]  You're lucky they didn't chase you.
[01:27:12.342 --> 01:27:13.242]  Well, you know what?
[01:27:13.342 --> 01:27:16.544]  If they had, I mean, they would be definitely messing with the wrong person.
[01:27:16.564 --> 01:27:17.204]  Trust me on that.
[01:27:17.244 --> 01:27:19.565]  I mean, I was really starting to get upset at that point.
[01:27:19.985 --> 01:27:24.606]  And they said, well, and the one policeman was telling the other two that had joined him, she's not one of them.
[01:27:25.067 --> 01:27:26.087]  I said, excuse me?
[01:27:26.487 --> 01:27:27.287]  I'm not one of them?
[01:27:27.347 --> 01:27:30.469]  I happen to be a parent with a child who was injured by vaccines.
[01:27:30.509 --> 01:27:31.709]  And of course, this affects
[01:27:32.049 --> 01:27:34.270]  Every parent in this country.
[01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:39.292]  Oh, I bet those cops have got a cousin or a nephew or a child that's autistic.
[01:27:39.633 --> 01:27:40.273]  Exactly.
[01:27:40.593 --> 01:27:42.634]  So I was just like, dude, and I was getting mad now.
[01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:46.856]  I'm like, dude, I was already through the doors where there was nobody, you know, going back towards the restrooms.
[01:27:46.876 --> 01:27:51.878]  And I said, and I turned around, I spun around, I said, do not follow me to the restrooms.
[01:27:51.958 --> 01:27:53.579]  I do not need to be escorted.
[01:27:53.879 --> 01:27:56.080]  Like, you know, I feel like a, like a thug.
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.782]  Look, the whole country is under martial law.
[01:27:58.822 --> 01:28:01.284]  They're just now trying to let us know we're under it.
[01:28:01.904 --> 01:28:03.045]  It was weird.
[01:28:03.225 --> 01:28:07.809]  Because I went to the restroom, and there were two nurses in there, and I was upset.
[01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:09.851]  I was like, telling me I'm not one of them.
[01:28:09.871 --> 01:28:12.032]  You know, I'm like, this makes me so upset.
[01:28:12.052 --> 01:28:14.954]  You know, I want to go out and tell the news what these guys are doing.
[01:28:15.175 --> 01:28:18.077]  So anyways, the guy was waiting for me when I got out of the restroom.
[01:28:18.397 --> 01:28:22.740]  And he escorted me back to the doors, you know, so I couldn't talk to anybody.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:27.343]  Oh yeah, they don't want you waking the cattle up who've been, who've been, who've been frauded into being there.
[01:28:27.363 --> 01:28:29.664]  Stay there, I'll talk to you a little bit more on the other side.
[01:28:29.684 --> 01:28:36.208]  Then we're going to the Ron Paul poll, the public declarations of shutting up martial law here in the United States and restricting free speech.
[01:28:36.568 --> 01:28:37.409]  It's all happening.
[01:28:37.429 --> 01:28:38.309]  They're moving against us.
[01:28:38.349 --> 01:28:39.610]  They know we're awake to them now.
[01:28:43.032 --> 01:28:43.993]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.433 --> 01:28:45.934]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.932 --> 01:28:49.793]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.073 --> 01:28:54.734]  You wear a seatbelt in your car.
[01:28:54.994 --> 01:28:56.294]  At home, you lock the doors.
[01:28:56.574 --> 01:28:58.274]  How about when you use your cell phone?
[01:28:58.494 --> 01:28:59.675]  How do you protect yourself?
[01:28:59.955 --> 01:29:05.596]  EMFs, or electromagnetic frequencies, act like an invisible pollution that surrounds us every day.
[01:29:05.816 --> 01:29:11.937]  Studies link EMFs to many ailments, from stress to depression, anxiety, decreased mental performance,
[01:29:12.097 --> 01:29:12.397]  I think?
[01:29:32.703 --> 01:29:39.007]  Installing the BioPro cell phone chip utilizes patented noise field technology to block harmful EMF pollution.
[01:29:39.227 --> 01:29:40.108]  Still not convinced?
[01:29:40.268 --> 01:29:46.211]  Go to ElectroPollution.org right now to purchase the extremely affordable BioPro cell chip.

[01:29:53.112 --> 01:29:54.793]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:29:55.073 --> 01:29:56.754]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:29:56.954 --> 01:30:00.975]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:30:01.175 --> 01:30:04.217]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:30:04.397 --> 01:30:08.218]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:30:08.379 --> 01:30:10.760]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:14.141]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[01:30:14.241 --> 01:30:14.501]  I think so.
[01:30:30.054 --> 01:30:30.715]  We're good to go.
[01:30:53.186 --> 01:30:56.389]  Yes, there is an In-Dash AM-FM shortwave radio.

[01:31:53.582 --> 01:32:10.752]  They came by the hundreds on a chilly Saturday morning to explain why their children had not received state-mandated vaccinations like those for chickenpox and hepatitis B. Some carried the letter written by the local state's attorney, threatening them with jail or fines if they didn't comply.
[01:32:10.872 --> 01:32:12.193]  Completely out of line.
[01:32:12.233 --> 01:32:13.354]  Want to put people in jail.
[01:32:13.774 --> 01:32:17.576]  This is like a junk mail sent to us.
[01:32:17.656 --> 01:32:18.497]  Ridiculous people.
[01:32:20.416 --> 01:32:23.259]  Who wants to go to jail for simple immunization?
[01:32:23.599 --> 01:32:24.680]  To send a letter like this?
[01:32:26.181 --> 01:32:27.242]  Like a solicitation?
[01:32:27.882 --> 01:32:29.163]  We're not stupid.
[01:32:29.444 --> 01:32:37.931]  Parents concerned about the safety of some vaccines confronted the state's attorney, who was threatening parents with jail, saying waivers should be more readily available.
[01:32:38.031 --> 01:32:46.257]  There are serious considerations for safety that need to be addressed before compelling people to vaccinate, even as a condition of going to school.
[01:32:46.417 --> 01:32:48.239]  Well, Mr. Ivey, what about those safety concerns?
[01:32:48.809 --> 01:32:54.661]  Well, I think they're fair considerations, and we talked about them on the phone yesterday, I believe.
[01:32:57.498 --> 01:33:00.881]  Parents that have those concerns have the right to execute the waiver.
[01:33:00.961 --> 01:33:05.744]  The point we were just talking about there was making the waiver more readily available inside right now.
[01:33:06.265 --> 01:33:11.408]  Waivers are available only for medical and religious reasons and opponents want to see that broadened.
[01:33:11.909 --> 01:33:14.911]  Early indications are the day did what authorities hoped.
[01:33:15.311 --> 01:33:22.977]  Many of those standing in line got pre-vaccinations for their children inside the courthouse so the kids can return to school next week.
[01:33:24.611 --> 01:33:27.272]  There you go, and they were all there thinking it was the law.
[01:33:27.332 --> 01:33:29.913]  This is dumb, me being here for not giving them a vaccination.
[01:33:29.933 --> 01:33:30.653]  Well, I'm here.
[01:33:31.513 --> 01:33:36.275]  So mission completed, but at least now there's resistance for the first time because they've been doing this for decades.
[01:33:36.635 --> 01:33:42.017]  And they would do this under color of law 80 years ago, 50 years ago, 25 years ago with eugenics.
[01:33:42.097 --> 01:33:44.878]  They would just tell the department to come pick you up and come sterilize you.
[01:33:45.418 --> 01:33:48.639]  Well, this is the same type of thing where they just announce it's the law and you've got to do it.
[01:33:49.099 --> 01:33:52.280]  In closing, Kelly Ann Davis, I salute you for what you've done.
[01:33:53.541 --> 01:34:10.873]  Certainly now people are becoming educated around the country that it's not the law, but at the same time the establishment use this as a way to push and have news announcements coast to coast on national television that it was the law and that you have to take it when there is no law.
[01:34:10.953 --> 01:34:15.496]  So this is a big deal here when we have a huge fraud like this.
[01:34:16.335 --> 01:34:16.616]  Right.
[01:34:16.956 --> 01:34:21.402]  I just wish the mainstream media would also pick up the story because I think it's just dumb.
[01:34:21.802 --> 01:34:27.049]  It tells a lot that I had to be escorted to the restroom by armed policemen with dogs.
[01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:30.914]  Because you wanted people to know that there was no law.
[01:34:31.715 --> 01:34:32.096]  Right.
[01:34:32.136 --> 01:34:34.499]  And that they had the option to use
[01:34:35.132 --> 01:34:35.953]  Uh, exemptions.
[01:34:36.413 --> 01:34:38.095]  And that there are safety issues here.
[01:34:38.115 --> 01:34:39.536]  You know, I mean, just that's all.
[01:34:39.576 --> 01:34:41.438]  I had the power of information.
[01:34:41.458 --> 01:34:47.483]  But again, even the exemptions, there's no law to begin with, then they add the exemption to give more color of law.
[01:34:47.523 --> 01:34:48.524]  That's not even needed.
[01:34:48.985 --> 01:34:50.166]  And that's been won in court.
[01:34:50.366 --> 01:34:51.347]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:34:51.607 --> 01:34:55.491]  Well, as this develops, we'll talk to you more, Kelly, and I really appreciate you coming on.
[01:34:55.971 --> 01:34:58.113]  Well, thank you just for making the issue aware.
[01:34:58.133 --> 01:34:59.395]  We really appreciate it, Alex.
[01:34:59.435 --> 01:35:02.778]  Are there any particular websites or groups that you work with that you'd like to plug?
[01:35:03.299 --> 01:35:08.845]  Well, I'm just trying to think of... I can't think of anything right off the top of my head.
[01:35:08.925 --> 01:35:12.028]  I'm just kind of coming on here as a voice for myself and my son right now.
[01:35:12.048 --> 01:35:12.769]  Well, good job.
[01:35:12.809 --> 01:35:15.111]  I'm glad you responded and went and made a difference.
[01:35:15.151 --> 01:35:15.612]  God bless you.
[01:35:15.632 --> 01:35:15.932]  Take care.
[01:35:16.092 --> 01:35:17.172]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:35:17.552 --> 01:35:20.573]  You bet, and I know we had other listeners that were there that have called me on-air.
[01:35:20.933 --> 01:35:22.634]  Later in the next hour, we have time to take calls.
[01:35:22.674 --> 01:35:24.554]  I meant to take calls today, but just so much happened.
[01:35:24.574 --> 01:35:25.994]  The Ron Paul poll's come in.
[01:35:27.055 --> 01:35:33.676]  I've got all this Marshall Law news that Steve Watson put together that really, after I read it, puts a picture that was even bleaker than I thought.
[01:35:34.256 --> 01:35:35.116]  They're making their move.
[01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:45.599]  But Aaron Dykes, we're going to get into this Ron Paul situation in a minute, but what is it like to know there's no law, to see all the documents, to have it all here, to live this, and to know the general public
[01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:48.080]  Again, is dumbed down and has no idea.
[01:35:48.100 --> 01:35:49.820]  They're like lambs for the slaughter.
[01:35:49.921 --> 01:35:57.123]  And this illustrates that we have state, federal, and local governments that are just completely lawless and know they're running scams against the public.
[01:35:57.663 --> 01:36:09.208]  It's an absolute nightmare after reading quotes from Bertrand Russell and Zbigniew Brzezinski about biochemical control of the population, about inoculating and using diet and injections to control us.
[01:36:09.728 --> 01:36:11.789]  And now we have to have injections when there's no law?
[01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:12.829]  It's a nightmare.
[01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:15.090]  It's just horrifying.
[01:36:15.862 --> 01:36:21.226]  And people all over the country watching CNN, Fox, all of it, saw that and heard, oh well, it's the law.
[01:36:23.127 --> 01:36:29.471]  I have arguments with people who have businesses and are successful and they still go, the government wouldn't lie, there's a law!
[01:36:30.172 --> 01:36:31.493]  And I'm like, no there isn't!
[01:36:31.513 --> 01:36:33.955]  You just heard Ivey, the state attorney!
[01:36:35.556 --> 01:36:36.837]  It's the same thing with the IRS.
[01:36:36.897 --> 01:36:41.600]  It is an offshore corporation, it is a scam, it is a fraud, it is paid to private banks.
[01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:46.353]  But they will come arrest you and juries will convict you in many cases.
[01:36:46.573 --> 01:36:48.034]  I'd say six, seven times out of ten.
[01:36:48.314 --> 01:36:49.135]  Though that's changing.
[01:36:49.155 --> 01:36:54.218]  At least people are getting found not guilty now in many cases, but not in the majority.
[01:36:55.019 --> 01:36:56.300]  And you try to tell a cop this.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.121]  You try to tell the public this.
[01:36:58.141 --> 01:37:00.022]  Look, we're not lying to you and we've proven it!
[01:37:00.943 --> 01:37:03.585]  And another example is churches.
[01:37:05.137 --> 01:37:18.942]  Until 1955 or so, no one got 501c3 tax exemptions because the First Amendment said, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, and then on to the freedom of the press and assembly and the rest of it.
[01:37:19.682 --> 01:37:21.803]  The First Amendment has like five clauses in it.
[01:37:23.844 --> 01:37:25.164]  A, most Americans don't know that.
[01:37:25.284 --> 01:37:32.607]  B, they just told bigger mega-churches, hey, if you want to get involved in other charities and do things that aren't church-related,
[01:37:33.594 --> 01:37:35.035]  Why don't you just sign this form?"
[01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:40.200]  And their lawyers of the big diocese, the Catholic Church and others, told them to do this.
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:53.811]  And so now, I see articles where rabbis in Denver who have ten people over their house get arrested, or little Baptist churches in the country that had just never signed on in a hundred years get raided, or they take churches and say, no 501c3?
[01:37:53.851 --> 01:37:54.351]  That's no law!
[01:37:58.664 --> 01:38:01.727]  If a church wants to opt into that, that's one thing, but they don't have to.
[01:38:02.468 --> 01:38:04.890]  And the courts have even ruled that, but it doesn't matter.
[01:38:05.670 --> 01:38:09.234]  They have special tax courts that aren't real courts, just like family courts.
[01:38:09.814 --> 01:38:13.117]  You go to a family court, there's no Bill of Rights, no Constitution, no due process.
[01:38:13.497 --> 01:38:16.180]  Though a federal court just ruled that the family courts have to stop this.
[01:38:16.780 --> 01:38:21.064]  That they just can't come to somebody's door without a warrant and demand to be let in and take somebody's child.
[01:38:21.745 --> 01:38:23.046]  That was just big news a month ago.
[01:38:23.737 --> 01:38:24.577]  A month and a half ago.
[01:38:24.737 --> 01:38:34.120]  I mean, folks, to know that there's mass fraud being committed, to have the absolute facts of it, we've got to warn people, we've got to get this information out to the people.
[01:38:35.001 --> 01:38:48.685]  Now, we're going to have more as the show develops, and we have the raw data, we have the entire poll, all 20 pages or whatever it is, of their breakdowns.
[01:38:50.276 --> 01:38:56.339]  And I wanted this to be a simple poll, and they assured us this was a simple poll, though I can't believe anyone would even sit through this.
[01:38:56.379 --> 01:38:59.181]  I mean, this is a gargantuan thing, and they say it's tiny.
[01:39:00.602 --> 01:39:06.425]  You know, how old they are, which demographic they're from, do they watch YouTube, are they on the internet a lot, or do they get on MySpace?
[01:39:06.945 --> 01:39:13.069]  And they specifically went after, you know, you call them up and they basically tell you what they're going to do.
[01:39:13.149 --> 01:39:15.150]  And I said, I want it to be fair, three simple questions.
[01:39:16.059 --> 01:39:17.140]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:39:37.999 --> 01:39:44.081]  And they went after mainline, hardcore Republicans who aren't on the Internet.
[01:39:44.421 --> 01:39:46.222]  That's their predominant group they targeted.
[01:39:49.003 --> 01:39:59.386]  And I wanted to illustrate this, but the good news is... I may even try another one of these same people and just demand it be like three simple questions.
[01:40:01.087 --> 01:40:07.129]  But even though the Ron Paul won two of the three
[01:40:08.653 --> 01:40:09.954]  Detailed questions.
[01:40:10.834 --> 01:40:19.920]  In a blind question about the candidates reading their bio, and by the way, we said fair bios.
[01:40:21.481 --> 01:40:24.282]  Frankly, the other bios lean towards other candidates.
[01:40:24.302 --> 01:40:26.043]  We had to get them to change the Mitt Romney thing.
[01:40:26.103 --> 01:40:30.906]  It said in there, the great man who fixed everything and was a love and a great family man.
[01:40:30.946 --> 01:40:33.167]  And I was like, hey, wait a minute.
[01:40:33.187 --> 01:40:34.188]  What's going on with this?
[01:40:34.787 --> 01:40:36.088]  And the same thing with Giuliani.
[01:40:36.748 --> 01:40:39.030]  And with Ron Paul, it was very mild.
[01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:40.891]  It just stated where he stands.
[01:40:41.311 --> 01:40:42.112]  He won that.
[01:40:42.292 --> 01:40:47.255]  And we're going to go over all of those numbers, but this is big news.
[01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:53.199]  Now, I'm going to, in the next few weeks, I'm going to, before the primary, I'm going to, I'm going to do it.
[01:40:54.099 --> 01:40:58.102]  I'm going to contact some other major polling firms, and I may even use Zobby, I don't think I'll use somebody else.
[01:40:58.732 --> 01:41:07.137]  And I think we're going to take a Zogby poll or a Gallup poll that was skewed towards Romney or McCain or somebody else.
[01:41:07.177 --> 01:41:08.518]  There's been a bunch of those published.
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:13.541]  And they have a lot of different ways of doing this.
[01:41:13.561 --> 01:41:19.045]  Paul Watson last week did a story where they would ask, which candidate are you going to vote for in the primary?
[01:41:19.445 --> 01:41:22.187]  And if they said Mitt Romney, they'd go on to a few questions and say thank you.
[01:41:22.487 --> 01:41:25.429]  Or if they said Giuliani, they'd go on to a few reasonable questions and say thank you.
[01:41:26.133 --> 01:41:32.757]  If they said Ron Paul, and we got copies of the poll and it was reported in the news, they would ask, what is your favorite sexual position?
[01:41:33.137 --> 01:41:34.117]  How do you cook rice?
[01:41:34.938 --> 01:41:35.858]  And people would hang up.
[01:41:36.158 --> 01:41:38.239]  And so then they wouldn't get a Ron Paul respondent.
[01:41:38.259 --> 01:41:39.080]  You understand how that works?
[01:41:39.380 --> 01:41:40.480]  It's kind of like a jury pool.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.441]  They would knock them out.
[01:41:44.362 --> 01:41:48.745]  At least this poll was fair in the respect that they did not do that.
[01:41:49.945 --> 01:41:50.306]  Okay?
[01:41:50.786 --> 01:41:53.027]  So this is a poll... I mean, Aaron, what do you think?
[01:41:53.047 --> 01:41:54.968]  Do you think this poll leaned a little bit against Ron Paul?
[01:41:56.387 --> 01:41:59.609]  Well, the Blind Bio was blind, at least in theory.
[01:42:00.210 --> 01:42:01.610]  And that's where he won, hands down.
[01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:02.511]  Hands down.
[01:42:02.531 --> 01:42:05.233]  And then he also won hands down on the war question.
[01:42:06.193 --> 01:42:07.874]  Yeah, people obviously won out of the war.
[01:42:07.914 --> 01:42:10.696]  You can see that through all the Democrats.
[01:42:10.716 --> 01:42:18.481]  This is mainly Republicans, but still the majority of them wanted Paul and they wanted... Tell you what, you've got the floor.
[01:42:18.521 --> 01:42:20.542]  You've been studying this the last hour since it came in.
[01:42:20.562 --> 01:42:22.283]  Aaron Dykes walked through
[01:42:24.484 --> 01:42:25.084]  Walk through it all.
[01:42:25.104 --> 01:42:29.866]  We've got Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Curt Nemo listing all the articles from all of you men from different angles of this.
[01:42:30.327 --> 01:42:32.427]  And we're also going to post the raw poll up there.
[01:42:32.487 --> 01:42:34.988]  Unlike a lot of people, we want you to actually see what happened.
[01:42:35.008 --> 01:42:35.949]  This is big news.
[01:42:36.429 --> 01:42:44.032]  Ron Paul, the bottom line, if people are actually shown his policies, and if they're actually shown where he stands, hands down, they go for him.
[01:42:44.292 --> 01:42:48.554]  And, hands down, with the smaller sample of Democrats, he was the most popular.
[01:42:49.094 --> 01:42:54.141]  Again, just like the bookies have said, they don't know how to analyze this because in their business if they get it wrong, they're out of business.
[01:42:55.023 --> 01:42:57.146]  They're saying Ron Paul is the only guy that can beat
[01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.670]  Hillary Clinton.
[01:42:59.191 --> 01:43:01.912]  That's why the Bushes are already appointing all these Clinton officials.
[01:43:02.252 --> 01:43:05.093]  That's why they have said they're already getting ready for the transition for her.
[01:43:05.373 --> 01:43:10.115]  That's why defense contractors have given 2 to 1 to her, even more than they've given them to Republicans.
[01:43:10.475 --> 01:43:15.957]  That's why Fox News is promoting her and having fundraisers, and the owner of it, Rupert Murdoch.
[01:43:16.398 --> 01:43:18.819]  So there's not even an election unless there's Ron Paul.
[01:43:19.619 --> 01:43:21.680]  Conservatives and Libertarians need to understand that.
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:24.681]  The establishment knows that, now saying his supporters are terrorists.
[01:43:25.341 --> 01:43:26.282]  So you've got the floor.
[01:43:27.823 --> 01:43:28.263]  Walk through it.
[01:43:28.283 --> 01:43:30.625]  I'll stop you every few minutes with my comments.
[01:43:30.945 --> 01:43:32.586]  Here is Aaron Dye for his analysis.
[01:43:33.467 --> 01:43:36.829]  Yeah, so it's pretty clear that people want out of the Iraq War.
[01:43:37.649 --> 01:43:41.192]  They did the question, which candidate are you more likely to vote for?
[01:43:41.212 --> 01:43:49.217]  A candidate who is opposed to the Iraq War and wants to begin an immediate withdrawal from Iraq, or a candidate who wants to stay the course in Iraq?
[01:43:49.737 --> 01:43:53.140]  Of course, Ron Paul is the only one willing to do an immediate withdrawal.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:56.343]  By the way, that's a buzzword that's a fully loaded condition word.
[01:43:56.383 --> 01:43:57.884]  I want to add, see, that's where that skewed.
[01:43:57.984 --> 01:43:59.285]  Stay the course.
[01:43:59.565 --> 01:44:05.530]  Like they said for Romney, who supports the troops by keeping them there, as if supporting them means keeping them.
[01:44:05.550 --> 01:44:09.213]  There's a lot of semantical stuff they don't think we'd get, but that's how they wrote that up.
[01:44:09.233 --> 01:44:10.054]  Oh, I agree.
[01:44:10.094 --> 01:44:13.137]  There's plenty of room to analyze loaded words.
[01:44:14.037 --> 01:44:18.141]  But in the most basic form, for the war or against the war,
[01:44:19.501 --> 01:44:28.565]  49% want immediate withdrawal, and 40% want to, quote, stay the course, and then another 10% are not sure.
[01:44:29.406 --> 01:44:38.309]  So it's clear that the votes are falling amongst conservatives, amongst Democrats, amongst everyone, for an immediate withdrawal overall.
[01:44:38.329 --> 01:44:41.791]  And let's go ahead, and then how did that question tie into Ron Paul?
[01:44:43.224 --> 01:44:47.427]  Well, it doesn't directly tie into Ron Paul, but we know of course he's going to withdraw.
[01:44:47.467 --> 01:44:49.188]  See, I told him to do the question before.
[01:44:49.248 --> 01:44:50.709]  Ron Paul says he's against the war.
[01:44:50.749 --> 01:44:51.590]  This guy says he's for it.
[01:44:51.630 --> 01:44:52.470]  This guy says he's for it.
[01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:53.271]  This guy says he's for it.
[01:44:53.471 --> 01:44:54.031]  Who are you for?
[01:44:54.051 --> 01:44:54.812]  And it turned into that.
[01:44:55.532 --> 01:44:57.033]  Okay, go to the next one.
[01:44:57.914 --> 01:45:06.920]  But the big exciting news is in this blind bio poll where we have a number of different biographies of candidates without their names.
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:08.941]  This is their policies then.
[01:45:09.728 --> 01:45:11.930]  Ron Paul is a big, big winner.
[01:45:12.470 --> 01:45:19.436]  Overall, the blind bio for Ron Paul, Ron Paul's policies have 32%, 32.8% with another 20% unsure and the other guys just drop like flies.
[01:45:19.456 --> 01:45:19.436]  18.
[01:45:19.476 --> 01:45:21.557]  18, 12, 15.
[01:45:19.556 --> 01:45:21.557]  Giuliani has 18.6, Romney has 15, Thompson has 12 something.
[01:45:35.362 --> 01:45:41.387]  Ron Paul's a big winner there, and all across the demographics, some demographics, he's a really big winner.
[01:45:41.407 --> 01:45:47.733]  Yeah, we need to have a few articles that say amongst this age and this group, you know, the highest numbers on that.
[01:45:48.254 --> 01:45:49.194]  Go over some of those numbers.
[01:45:52.257 --> 01:45:53.598]  Well, they have some demographics.
[01:45:54.039 --> 01:45:57.582]  People are wondering about telephone polls versus online presence.
[01:45:58.382 --> 01:46:02.126]  And overall, I'd have to say these are not online people.
[01:46:02.953 --> 01:46:04.355]  In fact, they ask questions about that.
[01:46:04.755 --> 01:46:11.123]  Yeah, about 70% or so never use MySpace or rarely use MySpace.
[01:46:11.904 --> 01:46:17.331]  The same for YouTube and Facebook, I guess, kind of the science of our time, yeah.
[01:46:18.805 --> 01:46:26.249]  So these are literally the dinosaurs again, skewing against Paul, the worst group, but we went with the worst group to, quote, call it fair.
[01:46:26.649 --> 01:46:33.134]  Now we're going to do another poll, like they would do, leaning towards a candidate that goes towards Ron Paul's demographic.
[01:46:33.214 --> 01:46:33.674]  But continue.
[01:46:34.739 --> 01:46:50.726]  Yeah, we're surprised to see, although 70 plus percent are not users of YouTube, Facebook, or MySpace, basically not online people overall, they still favor Ron Paul in a blind bio by 35 percent, 36 percent.
[01:46:52.467 --> 01:46:58.910]  Those who even never use it are still 31 percent in favor of Ron Paul, and the other people are still way down there.
[01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:01.651]  So that's pretty exciting numbers.
[01:47:02.435 --> 01:47:08.202]  Now, the way polls work, though, the more people you have, the more choices people tend to break it up more.
[01:47:08.322 --> 01:47:12.446]  I mean, when you've got them asking about all these candidates, it's a big deal to get 30-plus percent.
[01:47:13.588 --> 01:47:19.835]  Which we saw in all the Fox News polls and others and IP polls, where he would generally get 30-plus percent, maybe down in the 18s.
[01:47:19.875 --> 01:47:20.816]  That number keeps showing.
[01:47:21.542 --> 01:47:25.364]  Well, yeah, if they're going to vote just on the Iraq War issue, Ron Paul's a hands-down winner.
[01:47:25.384 --> 01:47:26.225]  Give him the number on that.
[01:47:26.785 --> 01:47:31.888]  That was 49% overall, and then the other candidates will be splitting amongst the 40%.
[01:47:32.328 --> 01:47:36.671]  Which demographic did he do best with on the question of the blind bio?
[01:47:37.511 --> 01:47:43.074]  On the question of the blind bio... I know this is tiny text.
[01:47:43.274 --> 01:47:45.556]  Sorry, there's a lot of different demographics here.
[01:47:46.456 --> 01:47:46.956]  He is a...
[01:47:50.307 --> 01:47:50.808]  I don't think so.
[01:48:00.982 --> 01:48:02.002]  We're good to go.
[01:48:30.269 --> 01:48:38.531]  Outstanding amongst the moderate voters, the largest voting bloc in the whole country, which is why he's going to just crush Hillary in a general election if he ever got there.
[01:48:39.011 --> 01:48:43.472]  We need an article about how this shows he would crush Hillary, because it certainly shows that.
[01:48:44.092 --> 01:48:47.813]  And of course, as Avi just showed last week, he got 15% and growing in New Hampshire.
[01:48:47.853 --> 01:48:48.713]  He could win, folks.
[01:48:49.114 --> 01:48:50.734]  That's why Ron Paul's exploding right now.
[01:48:51.454 --> 01:48:54.235]  It's literally reached hysteria level, thank God he's on Wednesday.
[01:48:54.995 --> 01:48:55.455]  Continue.
[01:48:55.855 --> 01:48:56.375]  Sure, sure.
[01:48:56.875 --> 01:48:59.336]  Union voters, they find that
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:05.262]  Approximately a third of the voters identify as being in a union.
[01:49:06.042 --> 01:49:09.044]  Ron Paul gets 36.6% of the vote there.
[01:49:10.045 --> 01:49:13.107]  The next highest is not sure with 23%.
[01:49:13.728 --> 01:49:17.650]  And after that we have Mitt Romney with 16.9%.
[01:49:18.071 --> 01:49:24.455]  Amongst non-union voters, people who did not identify as being in a union, which is about twice as many people.
[01:49:24.955 --> 01:49:30.599]  Ron Paul has double digit leads against everybody when the actual policies are put in front of people.
[01:49:31.909 --> 01:49:32.389]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:49:32.409 --> 01:49:34.610]  And that's true regardless of location.
[01:49:34.630 --> 01:49:35.431]  That's a headline.
[01:49:35.471 --> 01:49:36.231]  Double digit.
[01:49:36.271 --> 01:49:36.791]  Ron Paul.
[01:49:37.212 --> 01:49:44.735]  Ron Paul gets double digit leads against Republicans in every major demographic.
[01:49:45.015 --> 01:49:47.797]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so exciting.
[01:49:47.817 --> 01:49:48.977]  We'll be right back with more.
[01:49:49.237 --> 01:49:49.898]  We're there in Dykes.
[01:49:49.938 --> 01:49:50.958]  This poll just in.
[01:49:53.539 --> 01:49:54.940]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:56.021 --> 01:49:58.682]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:49:59.591 --> 01:50:01.972]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:02.652 --> 01:50:04.793]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:05.473 --> 01:50:07.714]  Won't their objection be world domination?
[01:50:08.274 --> 01:50:10.695]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:11.455 --> 01:50:18.818]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:21.803 --> 01:50:26.787]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.267 --> 01:50:30.749]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:33.651]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:33.691 --> 01:50:34.832]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:34.852 --> 01:50:35.572]  They're not after money.
[01:50:35.612 --> 01:50:36.713]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:36.893 --> 01:50:37.654]  They're after power.
[01:50:37.894 --> 01:50:38.714]  That's what I have to use it for.
[01:50:39.055 --> 01:50:43.598]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:50:43.798 --> 01:50:47.240]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:50.222]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:50.542 --> 01:50:51.742]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.483 --> 01:51:02.544]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:02.805 --> 01:51:14.027]  Black murky elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:14.347 --> 01:51:20.068]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:20.128 --> 01:51:20.809]  We're good to go!
[01:51:38.370 --> 01:51:40.954]  If you had a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188, call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:40.994 --> 01:51:42.757]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:55.914]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:51:56.155 --> 01:51:58.256]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:51:58.416 --> 01:52:00.878]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:52:01.138 --> 01:52:05.501]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:52:05.521 --> 01:52:06.202]  Here's why.
[01:52:06.622 --> 01:52:12.546]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:52:12.786 --> 01:52:18.790]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.951]  But they're not cheating.
[01:52:20.171 --> 01:52:24.174]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:52:24.374 --> 01:52:28.697]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:52:28.797 --> 01:52:36.322]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:52:36.342 --> 01:52:36.882]  Get control.
[01:52:37.162 --> 01:52:37.743]  Get relief.
[01:52:37.803 --> 01:52:38.504]  Get some sleep.
[01:52:38.624 --> 01:52:41.828]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[01:52:41.949 --> 01:52:45.313]  That's www.OutIn90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.353 --> 01:52:45.593]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:59.689 --> 01:53:14.457]  And to show how skewed this poll was against Ron Paul that he still won, in every major baseline Gallup poll, Angus and Reed, Mason Dixon, it seems to be added in the stories we do, you've got 75-80% of people against the war.
[01:53:16.138 --> 01:53:24.302]  You've got 91% from the high 80's to the highest of 91% against the open borders.
[01:53:24.562 --> 01:53:27.704]  Every issue that Ron Paul is on is popular.
[01:53:28.482 --> 01:53:34.887]  Unless, I've been seeing this info out on the web and news articles going, Ron Paul supports child predators online.
[01:53:35.528 --> 01:53:48.418]  No, they had a bill named that several times that would regulate the web and tax it and control it and track your IP addresses, and he didn't want the feds destroying the web, so he said no.
[01:53:49.519 --> 01:53:55.844]  They even put out a story during his congressional election last year, a year and a half ago, saying that Ron Paul was anti-gun.
[01:53:56.545 --> 01:54:03.229]  Because the NRA had endorsed a gun control bill, just like they're endorsing the new gun control bill.
[01:54:03.269 --> 01:54:13.834]  If you've ever had post-traumatic stress disorder, or any other thing that tens of millions of Americans have, if you've ever had ADHD, they say you won't be able to own a gun now.
[01:54:14.214 --> 01:54:14.935]  That's in the news!
[01:54:15.595 --> 01:54:17.336]  And they're calling that a pro-gun bill!
[01:54:17.756 --> 01:54:21.358]  And Ron Paul will vote against it, and the NRA will put out an announcement saying he's bad!
[01:54:23.698 --> 01:54:26.900]  I mean, I'm so tired of the trickery, and frankly, I didn't have a lot of time.
[01:54:27.321 --> 01:54:28.661]  I decided to do this last Wednesday.
[01:54:28.702 --> 01:54:29.442]  We called Zogby.
[01:54:29.482 --> 01:54:30.483]  They launched the poll Friday.
[01:54:30.523 --> 01:54:31.744]  I had like a day and a half to get it ready.
[01:54:32.264 --> 01:54:35.306]  And frankly, Aaron, reading this during the breaks, I mean, I'll be point blank about it.
[01:54:35.346 --> 01:54:37.147]  I don't even think this is a fair poll for Ron Paul.
[01:54:37.928 --> 01:54:40.129]  I mean, Giuliani did so good.
[01:54:40.169 --> 01:54:41.971]  He saved everybody on 9-11.
[01:54:42.271 --> 01:54:45.373]  He loves everybody, and he's so great, and everybody loves him.
[01:54:45.393 --> 01:54:49.676]  And then still, he loses for Ron Paul.
[01:54:49.696 --> 01:54:51.137]  So the bottom line is, when the people
[01:54:52.086 --> 01:54:56.128]  This is the old dinosaur voters, and by that I mean people that are dinosaurs technologically.
[01:54:56.168 --> 01:55:00.569]  This is skewed 70 plus percent for people who are not online.
[01:55:00.909 --> 01:55:04.450]  Ron Paul still wins, and they also said they were going to skew towards Republicans.
[01:55:04.470 --> 01:55:07.372]  They advised us, since it was a Republican primary, to do that.
[01:55:07.392 --> 01:55:08.492]  I wasn't going to argue.
[01:55:08.552 --> 01:55:09.552]  I wanted it to be done quick.
[01:55:09.812 --> 01:55:11.193]  They accidentally poll every two weeks.
[01:55:12.573 --> 01:55:15.434]  I mean, Aaron, do you agree with what I'm saying, or what's your take?
[01:55:15.454 --> 01:55:19.535]  I do agree, but I think it's clear that it's the policies who are a winner here.
[01:55:20.255 --> 01:55:24.336]  It's clear from reading these bios of Romney and Giuliani and Thompson.
[01:55:24.776 --> 01:55:27.077]  They stand for nothing, and they really haven't accomplished anything.
[01:55:27.097 --> 01:55:30.378]  There's no policies in the bio, and by the way, they use their official bios.
[01:55:30.518 --> 01:55:32.358]  And these aren't bios we wrote up, by the way.
[01:55:32.398 --> 01:55:36.459]  These were written by Zogby, and we had to change... And it's basically taken from them, yeah.
[01:55:36.619 --> 01:55:40.200]  Yeah, we had to change the most loaded words, like, he's a great leader.
[01:55:41.161 --> 01:55:42.403]  I don't think so.
[01:55:52.657 --> 01:55:55.320]  I don't even know if I'd consider that an accomplishment, but that's up to you.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:57.522]  The dollars in the toilet, everything's falling apart.
[01:55:57.562 --> 01:55:59.124]  I mean, that's the point.
[01:55:59.144 --> 01:56:00.986]  By the way, these bios are from their websites.
[01:56:01.006 --> 01:56:01.987]  That's what Zogby did.
[01:56:02.247 --> 01:56:04.349]  And then for Paul, they wrote one that really wasn't.
[01:56:04.910 --> 01:56:07.272]  And we're going to post all these.
[01:56:07.572 --> 01:56:14.880]  This is skewed towards Paul, but we quote, we're going to let them do one of their mainline polls just so we could experience it and write about it and talk about it.
[01:56:15.757 --> 01:56:20.380]  Yeah, so these are people who are not MySpace and YouTube users, for instance.
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.422]  Over 70 plus percent are not frequent.
[01:56:23.722 --> 01:56:26.123]  They're either rarely or never users of MySpace.
[01:56:26.163 --> 01:56:27.484]  Some of them aren't even familiar.
[01:56:27.984 --> 01:56:31.346]  And Ron Paul still dominates when we're talking about the policies.
[01:56:31.426 --> 01:56:34.268]  It's clear people advocate terms like
[01:56:34.808 --> 01:56:39.910]  Smaller government, individual liberty, following the Constitution, never raising taxes.
[01:56:40.311 --> 01:56:43.072]  Amongst Democrats and Republicans, this is what people want.
[01:56:43.112 --> 01:56:44.773]  Which shows that the paradigm shattered.
[01:56:44.793 --> 01:56:47.034]  Democrats get it now that big government isn't their friend.
[01:56:47.514 --> 01:56:54.777]  Yeah, it's just that Ron Paul's name hasn't been shoved out into the mainstream media like Giuliani, Romney, Giuliani, Romney, over and over.
[01:56:55.422 --> 01:56:58.504]  But the policies Ron Paul has, people want them.
[01:56:58.944 --> 01:56:59.944]  It's pretty clear from the polls.
[01:56:59.964 --> 01:57:04.447]  Well, in the stories we need to point out, Zogby got 15 points for him in New Hampshire last week.
[01:57:04.807 --> 01:57:06.508]  He's showing up in nine other polls.
[01:57:06.868 --> 01:57:09.889]  He is surging fast right now.
[01:57:10.109 --> 01:57:11.570]  That's the key battleground.
[01:57:12.431 --> 01:57:14.992]  But absolutely, stay there.
[01:57:15.012 --> 01:57:16.773]  I want to get into some more of these demographics.
[01:57:17.993 --> 01:57:20.094]  And should I take phone calls next hour?
[01:57:20.134 --> 01:57:23.016]  Should I do what I said I'd do and get into the police state martial law news?
[01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:25.430]  I don't know what to do.
[01:57:25.530 --> 01:57:30.176]  It's just there's so much news I haven't even gotten to yet and this whole whole situation is off the chart.
[01:57:30.196 --> 01:57:31.697]  Thank you for listening to GPN.
[01:57:31.737 --> 01:57:34.080]  Visit gpnlive.com today.
[01:57:49.036 --> 01:57:49.716]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.357 --> 01:57:51.478]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.118 --> 01:57:53.239]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.879 --> 01:57:54.699]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.460 --> 01:57:56.981]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.021 --> 01:58:00.703]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.203 --> 01:58:05.246]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.019 --> 01:58:14.322]  We're going to have more details and stories in the next two hours, preliminary, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:14.863 --> 01:58:22.207]  Ron Paul, in a blind poll, national scientific poll, Ron Paul in a national scientific poll, wins in every demographic.
[01:58:23.188 --> 01:58:32.354]  And then we go on to report that in a blind poll, that when they heard his policies, he beat them in every major demographic.
[01:58:32.434 --> 01:58:34.795]  He won hands down on the war.
[01:58:35.276 --> 01:58:37.197]  He won hands down on his policies.
[01:58:39.014 --> 01:58:39.314]  I think so.
[01:58:59.253 --> 01:59:00.835]  Every major debate poll but one.
[01:59:00.875 --> 01:59:10.043]  There was one Fox News where he had 34% when the poll closed, and then magically, an hour after the poll closed, they said, oh, you know what?
[01:59:11.644 --> 01:59:17.529]  After we tabulated things, and these were text polls, after we tabulated things and after
[01:59:18.900 --> 01:59:20.981]  Hannity had thrown a fit and said it was all rigged.
[01:59:21.521 --> 01:59:26.023]  Magically, Romney won by just a few points, and Ron Paul got a second.
[01:59:26.323 --> 01:59:28.384]  But in every other poll, these are computers.
[01:59:28.924 --> 01:59:47.431]  One IP per phone call number, off the phone's IP, off its number, off of the text message's IP, off the cell phone's, it's the same as a computer, off the internet, every major poll, and there have been just hundreds of them now, he wins, wins, wins, wins, wins, where it's one IP, one computer.
[01:59:48.166 --> 01:59:49.787]  He keeps winning when they're able to hear him.
[01:59:49.807 --> 01:59:52.169]  They say, okay, you just saw 10 guys talk, who are you for?
[01:59:52.389 --> 01:59:53.329]  We're for Ron Paul!
[01:59:54.790 --> 01:59:59.193]  Okay, and they go, oh no, no, no, no, it's a computer program, it's a fraud, it doesn't exist.
[01:59:59.433 --> 02:00:03.355]  Then he raises $4.2 million, breaking any pre-primary record.
[02:00:04.476 --> 02:00:06.297]  Then the media spins it and says, that's nothing!
[02:00:06.357 --> 02:00:10.860]  During the election, Terry raised $6.1 million.
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:12.881]  Well, that was during the election when he was the nominee.
[02:00:14.022 --> 02:00:15.483]  See, I mean, they poo-poo everything.
[02:00:16.411 --> 02:00:18.072]  And now they're saying he's a terrorist.
[02:00:18.432 --> 02:00:19.852]  They're getting scared of Ron Paul.
[02:00:19.872 --> 02:00:21.473]  They know he's surging.
[02:00:21.513 --> 02:00:27.515]  But this is an important poll, because even though we tried to get a fair poll, and by fair, we didn't try to skew it for Paul.
[02:00:28.856 --> 02:00:36.198]  Even though we tried to do that, still, looking over this poll, I'd have to say it leans towards Thompson and Giuliani and Romney.
[02:00:38.199 --> 02:00:42.421]  But even the mainstream media has to admit now, Ron Paul is surging, growing, exploding.
[02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:45.522]  People are learning who he is, and folks, you've got to fight
[02:00:46.463 --> 02:00:47.344]  Like, you've never fought.
[02:00:47.784 --> 02:00:53.987]  If you are in Nevada, or if you are in New Hampshire, or if you are in Michigan, this is only a month and a half away.
[02:00:55.048 --> 02:00:58.850]  And you have got to get out there, and we've also got to have poll watchers who do exit polls.
[02:00:58.870 --> 02:01:01.371]  You know there's going to be fraud, but we can't just give up because of that.
[02:01:01.711 --> 02:01:12.317]  At least Ron Paul is injecting major issues into the discussion, and he's showing everybody that the left and right doesn't exist, that we're coming together for liberty and freedom, that liberty and freedom is popular.
[02:01:12.857 --> 02:01:20.742]  And it's creating cohorts, big armies of people, of meetup groups, of organizations that can continue to fight on in your area.
[02:01:21.082 --> 02:01:23.444]  You should be talking about this now in your meetups for Ron Paul.
[02:01:23.484 --> 02:01:24.625]  Hey, let's pick local issues.
[02:01:24.985 --> 02:01:25.805]  Let's stay together.
[02:01:25.845 --> 02:01:27.727]  Let's move forward, whatever happens with this.
[02:01:28.327 --> 02:01:33.931]  And the other big issue is, this shows with Democrats, he is extremely popular, and moderates,
[02:01:34.791 --> 02:01:35.471]  And others.
[02:01:35.871 --> 02:01:37.052]  That he could beat Hillary.
[02:01:37.092 --> 02:01:43.153]  All the other Republicans are wildly unpopular, and the White House isn't even acting like anyone's being run against Hillary.
[02:01:43.493 --> 02:01:44.794]  Aaron?
[02:01:44.874 --> 02:01:47.134]  This is the other side issue that's so interesting.
[02:01:47.515 --> 02:01:52.496]  The big question in the Republican Party is what's going to happen politically with the religious right?
[02:01:52.936 --> 02:01:54.557]  The leaders can't come to a consensus.
[02:01:54.597 --> 02:01:55.257]  They're now defecting.
[02:01:56.437 --> 02:02:06.684]  Now, when they're not led to a certain candidate, and when they're just hinging on the issues here, when they're asking, which issues am I going to vote for, it is hands down across every religious group.
[02:02:07.345 --> 02:02:12.228]  Sub-Jewish, which I identified as largely not sure, with over 43% not sure.
[02:02:12.328 --> 02:02:13.529]  Okay, but read the demographics.
[02:02:13.809 --> 02:02:14.650]  Let's look.
[02:02:14.730 --> 02:02:15.831]  Catholics, 30% for Ron Paul.
[02:02:15.851 --> 02:02:17.152]  Religious Protestant, 33% for Ron Paul.
[02:02:17.172 --> 02:02:17.952]  Born again,
[02:02:22.275 --> 02:02:23.256]  29% for Ron Paul.
[02:02:23.276 --> 02:02:24.117]  Another headline!
[02:02:24.197 --> 02:02:28.240]  Ron Paul wins National Poll of Religious Voters!
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.601]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[02:02:29.722 --> 02:02:32.264]  Oh, you'll be crushed, you old order!
[02:02:32.624 --> 02:02:33.465]  Stay there, Dykes.
[02:02:33.485 --> 02:02:34.966]  This is getting even better!
[02:02:35.426 --> 02:02:36.987]  I'm sorry, I have a little bit of pleasure.
[02:02:37.007 --> 02:02:38.789]  It's kind of like my team just won the Super Bowl.
[02:02:38.989 --> 02:02:40.550]  See, I get excited about things that matter.
[02:02:40.570 --> 02:02:41.671]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.134 --> 02:02:46.555]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:47.636 --> 02:02:48.637]  A new world order.
[02:02:49.366 --> 02:02:53.567]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:02:54.268 --> 02:02:57.128]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:02:57.148 --> 02:02:59.329]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[02:02:59.869 --> 02:03:02.330]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:10.573]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:13.393 --> 02:03:18.355]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:18.855 --> 02:03:22.316]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:22.716 --> 02:03:25.237]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:25.277 --> 02:03:26.417]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:26.437 --> 02:03:27.217]  They're not after money.
[02:03:27.237 --> 02:03:28.297]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:28.497 --> 02:03:29.258]  They're after power.
[02:03:29.478 --> 02:03:30.518]  That's what they're after.

[02:04:44.301 --> 02:04:47.624]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[02:04:47.984 --> 02:04:54.891]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[02:04:55.251 --> 02:05:07.762]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[02:05:07.983 --> 02:05:10.625]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[02:05:10.965 --> 02:05:17.148]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[02:05:17.388 --> 02:05:22.530]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[02:05:22.770 --> 02:05:31.034]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.

[02:05:44.361 --> 02:05:49.423]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:49.783 --> 02:05:52.065]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:52.545 --> 02:05:59.469]  It was big national news a month ago when they had a poll of the evangelical
[02:06:01.969 --> 02:06:03.371]  National Organization here.
[02:06:03.391 --> 02:06:04.652]  I forget the exact name of it.
[02:06:05.112 --> 02:06:09.416]  And Ron Paul came in second.
[02:06:10.037 --> 02:06:10.738]  That was big news.
[02:06:10.778 --> 02:06:12.279]  Well, he's come in number one here.
[02:06:12.900 --> 02:06:16.643]  This is a big scientific poll of thousands by Zogby.
[02:06:17.324 --> 02:06:18.805]  And it's skewed towards the other guys.
[02:06:18.846 --> 02:06:21.088]  We paid for it and tried to have it just fair.
[02:06:21.128 --> 02:06:22.509]  And fair turned out being for them.
[02:06:22.569 --> 02:06:23.390]  They just kept pushing.
[02:06:27.373 --> 02:06:28.534]  Aaron, go over this.
[02:06:28.554 --> 02:06:29.656]  This is incredible news.
[02:06:29.716 --> 02:06:31.037]  And folks, start your engines.
[02:06:31.477 --> 02:06:37.684]  We're going to have five, six, seven articles out today on Jones Report, Truth News, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.net.
[02:06:38.445 --> 02:06:39.406]  I don't have enough guys, though.
[02:06:39.426 --> 02:06:40.106]  They're doing a great job.
[02:06:40.126 --> 02:06:41.608]  I'm like, do one on this and warn them.
[02:06:41.668 --> 02:06:43.690]  See that the vaccines, they said they had to take them.
[02:06:43.710 --> 02:06:44.170]  It's a lie.
[02:06:44.511 --> 02:06:45.972]  Do one on this.
[02:06:46.132 --> 02:06:46.593]  Warn them!
[02:06:46.753 --> 02:06:47.434]  Warn them all!
[02:06:47.774 --> 02:06:50.897]  Yeah, because we're just fighting here, and we're fighting hard.
[02:06:50.957 --> 02:06:59.405]  But Aaron, go through, just go through all the demographics, but go through the religious, then go through the different breakdowns of the different parties, and the different affiliations.
[02:07:00.005 --> 02:07:06.812]  I mean, looking over this, it looks like you want at least 90% of the demographics, or just a few that call themselves very conservative.
[02:07:06.852 --> 02:07:10.135]  That means they literally come in their house at night and look under their bed for Al-Qaeda.
[02:07:12.776 --> 02:07:16.838]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:07:17.619 --> 02:07:27.704]  Ron Paul dominated almost every demographic, but I think the religious identification demographic is the most interesting.
[02:07:28.845 --> 02:07:33.828]  Ron Paul has the religious, including the coveted evangelicals.
[02:07:33.848 --> 02:07:36.469]  But this poll doesn't show he just has the religious right.
[02:07:36.489 --> 02:07:37.610]  He has all the religious.
[02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:44.095]  Uh, he dominates every single category, uh, except for Jewish who are entirely unsure about this election.
[02:07:44.596 --> 02:07:54.504]  He has, uh, 30% of Catholics, uh, whereas, uh, the next highest percentage is not sure, and then, uh, Giuliani with only 18%, he is a Catholic.
[02:07:55.345 --> 02:07:59.088]  Um, the religious Protestants want Ron Paul by 33%.
[02:07:59.168 --> 02:08:01.310]  They love his issues.
[02:08:02.031 --> 02:08:04.313]  Uh, the next highest is, uh, Giuliani.
[02:08:05.776 --> 02:08:13.634]  So I guess that endorsement by Harry Roberts didn't help when he endorsed Giuliani last week.
[02:08:15.166 --> 02:08:16.727]  I guess not.
[02:08:16.987 --> 02:08:26.410]  The quote, other religious identification, he has 38%, 38.6%, with another 28% unsure.
[02:08:26.870 --> 02:08:28.510]  Very low numbers for the other people.
[02:08:28.530 --> 02:08:31.331]  Give us some of the numbers for the other little creatures.
[02:08:32.051 --> 02:08:35.973]  In this other category in particular, candidate C was Fred Thompson.
[02:08:36.013 --> 02:08:36.433]  He only has 5.3%.
[02:08:36.653 --> 02:08:38.933]  I mean, that is triple digit leads!
[02:08:41.073 --> 02:08:41.713]  No, I don't think so.
[02:09:03.343 --> 02:09:03.944]  I don't think so.
[02:09:12.702 --> 02:09:14.724]  Born Again's No, I'm Not Born Again.
[02:09:15.905 --> 02:09:24.934]  Ron Paul is 36.5%, and then all the other guys are under 20%, right around 16% actually, with another 14% outstanding.
[02:09:25.275 --> 02:09:27.557]  He just dominates every single religious category.
[02:09:27.577 --> 02:09:31.781]  Ron Paul dominates every religious category and scientific poll.
[02:09:32.161 --> 02:09:34.604]  And the point is... Wins every coveted position.
[02:09:35.387 --> 02:09:36.629]  I mean, no surprise though.
[02:09:36.649 --> 02:09:41.036]  Ron Paul wants the Constitution and the other people want to destroy it, Pat and Lee.
[02:09:41.657 --> 02:09:43.080]  The other people want to continue the war.
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:49.470]  So when faced with issues, the religious voters, non-religious, liberal, moderate, conservative, they're all for him.
[02:09:50.382 --> 02:09:52.543]  And then it's the same thing in the income category.
[02:09:52.843 --> 02:09:54.443]  People under $25,000 a year, he's a clear win, 47.6%.
[02:09:54.483 --> 02:09:56.483]  People with only $25,000 to $35,000, he has 32% a clear win.
[02:09:56.503 --> 02:09:58.184]  People with $35,000 to $50,000, he's a clear win with 34%.
[02:09:58.764 --> 02:09:59.644]  People with $50,000 to $75,000, clear win, 33%.
[02:09:59.684 --> 02:09:59.744]  $75,000 to $100,000, 34%.
[02:09:59.944 --> 02:10:00.064]  Over $100,000, 31%.
[02:10:00.124 --> 02:10:01.485]  Over and over, he dominates every category.
[02:10:20.009 --> 02:10:20.369]  We're good to go.
[02:10:44.935 --> 02:10:46.918]  Don't wait for orders from headquarters, boys and girls.
[02:10:46.978 --> 02:10:49.040]  Now is the time to attack Pattern Delta.
[02:10:49.461 --> 02:10:55.768]  And by the way, of the people they pulled, I think it was about 58% who have armed forces in their family.
[02:10:56.369 --> 02:10:57.370]  They all weren't wrong, Paul.
[02:10:57.470 --> 02:11:00.034]  Oh, armed forces is a major sign of exogamy, Paul.
[02:11:00.274 --> 02:11:00.935]  Give us the numbers.
[02:11:01.695 --> 02:11:03.336]  Uh, he has 33.3 percent.
[02:11:03.356 --> 02:11:08.117]  And in all these articles, we gotta put the next candidate, what they had to show, that he's dominating.
[02:11:08.318 --> 02:11:11.119]  People hear those numbers, they don't understand 30 is totally dominating.
[02:11:11.559 --> 02:11:16.620]  But in almost every case here, he has... Give us the armed forces categories, this is absolutely key.
[02:11:17.081 --> 02:11:21.562]  The question is, do you have armed forces in the family when they respond to the blind poll?
[02:11:22.042 --> 02:11:23.863]  Ron Paul pulls in 33.3 percent, then
[02:11:27.024 --> 02:11:27.985]  Giuliani has only 18%.
[02:11:30.347 --> 02:11:31.068]  Fred Thompson has 13.6%.
[02:11:31.588 --> 02:11:36.252]  Mitt Romney has 15.6%.
[02:11:36.792 --> 02:11:42.016]  So Ron Paul has 50% more support than Romney.
[02:11:42.036 --> 02:11:42.337]  Go ahead.
[02:11:42.777 --> 02:11:43.678]  Yeah, I think that's clear.
[02:11:44.418 --> 02:11:49.923]  But even amongst people who don't have armed forces in the family, still want out of the war, still want Ron Paul by 32.1%.
[02:11:49.963 --> 02:11:50.763]  Another 23% outstanding.
[02:11:55.350 --> 02:12:00.811]  Rudy Giuliani has only 19.6 percent, less than the unsure numbers.
[02:12:01.652 --> 02:12:02.972]  Thompson has an abysmal 11.2.
[02:12:03.272 --> 02:12:06.353]  Mitt Romney has 14.4.
[02:12:06.653 --> 02:12:10.114]  They're really not pulling here.
[02:12:10.214 --> 02:12:14.415]  Now the media will get this and they'll spin and go, only 30 percent against war.
[02:12:14.535 --> 02:12:20.656]  No, that was the majority voting for Ron Paul for those policies, so it's a huge win.
[02:12:20.956 --> 02:12:21.556]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:12:22.337 --> 02:12:24.117]  A clear majority do want out of the war.
[02:12:24.457 --> 02:12:30.178]  I mean, that one with 49, where there's all these candidates and he got almost half of it with all these other candidates against him.
[02:12:30.418 --> 02:12:30.959]  That's huge.
[02:12:31.199 --> 02:12:34.119]  We already know that 70 plus percent of the people in the U.S.
[02:12:34.759 --> 02:12:35.720]  want the war to end.
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:40.721]  What this poll shows is that 49 percent are going to vote based on that fact.
[02:12:41.721 --> 02:12:42.221]  Good point.
[02:12:43.341 --> 02:12:44.322]  Very good point, Aaron.
[02:12:44.362 --> 02:12:45.222]  Please continue.
[02:12:47.222 --> 02:12:48.963]  Well, it's just, it's very surprising.
[02:12:48.983 --> 02:12:50.423]  It's nice numbers here.
[02:12:51.437 --> 02:12:52.499]  Well, you've got a lot of other numbers.
[02:12:52.559 --> 02:12:58.226]  I mean, he wins in the religious, he wins in the military, he wins in the conservative, he wins in the liberal, he wins in the moderate.
[02:12:58.627 --> 02:13:02.191]  The only group he didn't win, I guess, is those that call themselves very conservative.
[02:13:04.139 --> 02:13:08.361]  Meaning they've been to the White House to get their visit with Jeff Gannon.
[02:13:08.561 --> 02:13:14.745]  Well, even there, I think the numbers just show that it's pretty split and a lot of people haven't come to a clear final decision.
[02:13:14.765 --> 02:13:18.026]  Now, they told us they were going to sample 1,009 people.
[02:13:18.046 --> 02:13:18.787]  I'm going from memory.
[02:13:19.127 --> 02:13:23.649]  But they were going to sample over 1,000 people, but then they were going to oversample to be sure it skewed conservative.
[02:13:23.869 --> 02:13:26.170]  They thought that was important because it was a Republican primary.
[02:13:26.511 --> 02:13:31.973]  We were wanting to show what we would do in a general election, and so they just kind of did what they wanted, and it came up to noon Friday.
[02:13:31.993 --> 02:13:32.994]  We couldn't haggle anymore.
[02:13:33.314 --> 02:13:37.797]  I'm not saying in the poll results, I'm saying this poll is skewed towards the other guys.
[02:14:03.075 --> 02:14:06.619]  Yeah, I mean, polls are ridiculous, basically, the way they're written.
[02:14:06.699 --> 02:14:09.862]  I mean, the use of loaded words, you really have to be careful about.
[02:14:10.523 --> 02:14:22.935]  And like I said, for Mitt Romney, he had at least six very clearly loaded words along the lines of, I don't think they called him a hero, but they called him a strong family man.
[02:14:24.116 --> 02:14:24.937]  I don't know.
[02:14:40.934 --> 02:14:41.915]  But he supports the war.
[02:14:41.955 --> 02:14:43.196]  I mean, that was the bottom line.
[02:14:43.236 --> 02:14:46.538]  The three candidates who supported the war did not win the support in this vote.
[02:14:46.578 --> 02:14:47.299]  But it's not clear.
[02:14:47.339 --> 02:14:54.444]  They told us that they were going to skew toward Republicans, and then it says they only got 300 and something that were Republicans.
[02:14:54.684 --> 02:15:01.289]  Well, I think the point is that people who are either independent or Democrat were a larger percentage, so it took longer to get 50%.
[02:15:01.709 --> 02:15:03.610]  Because there's so few Republicans now, yeah.
[02:15:03.890 --> 02:15:04.391]  Thanks to Bush.
[02:15:04.411 --> 02:15:05.532]  There's a lot of independent...
[02:15:06.667 --> 02:15:07.387]  Moderate voters.
[02:15:07.627 --> 02:15:10.309]  Ooh, look at those numbers fast.
[02:15:10.349 --> 02:15:11.269]  I got 20 pages there.
[02:15:11.809 --> 02:15:14.731]  Is this showing that the majority of people are now calling themselves independent?
[02:15:14.791 --> 02:15:15.991]  That's news in and of itself.
[02:15:17.652 --> 02:15:23.074]  I don't know if I have that definitive number here, but I know that moderate was probably the biggest group.
[02:15:23.554 --> 02:15:28.377]  I don't know that moderate's exactly the same as independent, but it's the same kind of territory, I think.
[02:15:28.677 --> 02:15:31.318]  I think it is, because it's the questions they gave them.
[02:15:31.638 --> 02:15:33.659]  If they would have asked independent, I think you would have seen that, too.
[02:15:34.904 --> 02:15:35.385]  Yeah, I'm sure.
[02:15:35.425 --> 02:15:36.646]  I mean, it means two different things.
[02:15:36.666 --> 02:15:40.089]  The word independent was not used in this poll, as far as I can recall.
[02:15:40.309 --> 02:15:45.014]  Independent and moderate are two different things in the common nomenclature, but they're very similar.
[02:15:45.194 --> 02:15:48.878]  But I believe semantically that they gave the term moderate to represent independent.
[02:15:49.318 --> 02:15:50.099]  Okay, here we go.
[02:15:50.559 --> 02:15:51.480]  Party recorded.
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:55.844]  Now, these numbers show the... Let's see.
[02:15:59.714 --> 02:16:05.598]  And I want the point made in all the articles, men, that we're writing, unless you disagree with this analysis, but it's clear.
[02:16:06.579 --> 02:16:15.185]  We set out, and I want to publish the actual questions and all the data, unlike others, that we did this to make it fair.
[02:16:16.346 --> 02:16:16.526]  Okay?
[02:16:16.546 --> 02:16:20.930]  But I want to present this with the second and third question first, and then the first question third.
[02:16:20.970 --> 02:16:21.110]  Okay?
[02:16:21.130 --> 02:16:22.191]  That's how I want this presented.
[02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:26.634]  And I just, you know what?
[02:16:27.708 --> 02:16:31.872]  I just couldn't make myself or Ron Paul try to spin this poll, but then they spun it the other way.
[02:16:31.892 --> 02:16:35.696]  It's like you have to spin it just to get them to spin it back to where it's in the middle.
[02:16:36.096 --> 02:16:38.799]  But no, we didn't spin, so they spun the other way, but we still win.
[02:16:39.420 --> 02:16:41.582]  We're always winning against a rigged deck here.
[02:16:42.823 --> 02:16:46.867]  It looks like roughly speaking about 30% identified as independents here.
[02:16:47.548 --> 02:16:49.870]  So out of a thousand and nine respondents?
[02:16:50.050 --> 02:16:51.692]  A thousand and nine is what I see here, yeah.
[02:16:52.387 --> 02:16:52.747]  Okay.
[02:16:52.908 --> 02:16:54.509]  But I don't know if they published here.
[02:16:54.529 --> 02:16:57.991]  They said they're getting us more if they over-sampled for Republicans.
[02:16:58.092 --> 02:16:59.753]  Yeah, I haven't had a chance to talk to them in detail.
[02:16:59.773 --> 02:17:03.636]  I think that means that they called more Republican numbers to even get their 300.
[02:17:04.837 --> 02:17:05.597]  I think so, yeah.
[02:17:06.538 --> 02:17:13.544]  I have to find out the details about the exact polling numbers, but it looks like the number they used for calculation is 1,009.
[02:17:15.585 --> 02:17:16.786]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:17:16.846 --> 02:17:18.948]  Well, that was money well spent.
[02:17:19.188 --> 02:17:19.588]  How much was it, 4,001?
[02:17:21.404 --> 02:17:23.705]  4,300.
[02:17:21.604 --> 02:17:23.705]  4,300.
[02:17:21.884 --> 02:17:23.705]  Okay, that's for the article, too.
[02:17:23.725 --> 02:17:26.726]  Aaron Dykes, you are a man of many talents here.
[02:17:26.786 --> 02:17:33.049]  Launched your first big political poll, and you did something that may have been a first in politics, which actually was done to be fair.
[02:17:33.829 --> 02:17:37.531]  My goodness, we actually won a fair fight here, against an enemy that cheats.
[02:17:38.271 --> 02:17:43.173]  We're going to come back, ladies and gentlemen, wrap this discussion up with a poll, and I'm going to get into the martial law news.
[02:17:45.160 --> 02:17:48.824]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:17:49.224 --> 02:17:54.649]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:17:55.110 --> 02:17:56.191]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[02:17:56.231 --> 02:18:00.275]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:18:00.915 --> 02:18:14.260]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:18:14.720 --> 02:18:20.042]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:18:20.322 --> 02:18:26.224]  Whether you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:18:44.884 --> 02:18:47.405]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:48.045 --> 02:18:57.289]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:18:58.209 --> 02:19:05.012]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:19:05.912 --> 02:19:07.373]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:19:07.593 --> 02:19:10.634]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[02:19:11.610 --> 02:19:20.157]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:19:48.219 --> 02:19:50.339]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:19:50.479 --> 02:19:52.940]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?

[02:19:57.582 --> 02:19:58.263]  Here's why.
[02:19:58.683 --> 02:20:04.605]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[02:20:04.845 --> 02:20:10.847]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[02:20:11.068 --> 02:20:12.008]  But they're not cheating.
[02:20:12.228 --> 02:20:16.231]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[02:20:16.432 --> 02:20:20.755]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[02:20:20.855 --> 02:20:28.381]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.

[02:20:29.222 --> 02:20:29.803]  Get relief.

[02:20:44.824 --> 02:20:49.108]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:20:49.348 --> 02:20:54.193]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:54.453 --> 02:20:55.774]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.

[02:21:22.276 --> 02:21:23.877]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:21:24.157 --> 02:21:25.318]  And I say it big time.
[02:21:25.558 --> 02:21:26.539]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:21:26.579 --> 02:21:26.839]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:21:37.026 --> 02:21:39.528]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:22:01.568 --> 02:22:09.944]  About 30% of the people that were polled in this National Zogby phone call going in their backyard with their ballgame.
[02:22:11.736 --> 02:22:20.842]  When they polled YouTube users, that's the third largest website out there now, or fourth largest, Ron Paul was the absolute dominator in a big field.
[02:22:21.342 --> 02:22:22.303]  Aaron, give them those numbers.
[02:22:23.244 --> 02:22:28.967]  Well, I think the first point here is we wonder, what's the difference between online versus telephone poll?
[02:22:29.468 --> 02:22:37.493]  And we'll see that they asked, of course, do you use MySpace, YouTube, Facebook every day, a few times a week, a few times a month, rarely or never?
[02:22:38.173 --> 02:22:43.138]  And 75% fell in the rarely, never, or a few times a month category.
[02:22:43.178 --> 02:22:44.519]  These are not internet people.
[02:22:44.539 --> 02:22:50.965]  The telephone pole people and the internet people are not the same people, but they still support Ron Paul's policies overall.
[02:22:50.985 --> 02:22:55.468]  So Ron Paul wins telephone pole and he also wins even bigger with the internet.
[02:22:55.909 --> 02:22:58.331]  Yeah, so we see about 23% actually use YouTube every day.
[02:23:02.808 --> 02:23:03.568]  No, I'm sorry, that's only 2.3%.
[02:23:05.109 --> 02:23:06.569]  Very few people use it every day.
[02:23:06.609 --> 02:23:08.569]  These are not big internet users.
[02:23:09.370 --> 02:23:17.872]  But amongst those who do use YouTube every day, an overwhelming 54.5% supported the blind bio of Ron Paul.
[02:23:17.892 --> 02:23:19.092]  They love his policies.
[02:23:19.992 --> 02:23:22.193]  Another 21.5%... So YouTube viewers, he got 54%.
[02:23:24.392 --> 02:23:24.672]  Yeah.
[02:23:24.892 --> 02:23:29.415]  And that shows what the future of politics is going, because everything's accelerating into the web world.
[02:23:29.455 --> 02:23:33.437]  The old dinosaurs are dying, you know, of broadcast TV and print.
[02:23:34.138 --> 02:23:38.260]  Yeah, I think the unsure voters, a lot of those are likely to fall with Ron Paul as well.
[02:23:38.400 --> 02:23:43.483]  And that's what this whole police state's about, we're about to be discussing, is they're racing to block this revolution.
[02:23:43.543 --> 02:23:46.285]  Ron Paul is just a symbol, or a symptom of that.
[02:23:47.128 --> 02:23:53.551]  And see, amongst those who use YouTube every day, only 2.2% favor Mitt Romney's bio.
[02:23:54.092 --> 02:23:57.173]  Only 6.2% favor Giuliani's bio.
[02:23:58.154 --> 02:24:02.396]  Thompson does get about 15%, but that is nowhere close to Ron Paul.
[02:24:02.416 --> 02:24:02.396]  54.
[02:24:02.796 --> 02:24:04.757]  Now, what about people that use it sometimes?
[02:24:05.849 --> 02:24:09.712]  Uh, sometimes it actually seemed to be skewed a little against Ron Paul.
[02:24:09.752 --> 02:24:19.020]  Those who use it just a few times a week, uh, they still did favor Ron Paul by 29%, uh, but they also favored Giuliani with 31%.
[02:24:20.141 --> 02:24:23.383]  But the point is, they keep saying this is fake on the internet and he doesn't even have support on the internet.
[02:24:23.423 --> 02:24:30.149]  This is showing that in this telephone poll, where 70 plus percent don't even use computers, with the other 25%, he's winning hands down.
[02:24:30.769 --> 02:24:39.714]  Well, that is my point, because those who use it every day or a few times a week, we're only about 12 or 13 percent, depending on whether it's MySpace, YouTube, or Facebook.
[02:24:40.174 --> 02:24:50.179]  An overwhelming 75 percent or so use it rarely or never, and those people still favored Ron Paul by margins, mostly in the 30s.
[02:24:51.020 --> 02:24:54.681]  Those who rarely use YouTube favored Ron Paul by 36 percent.
[02:24:56.062 --> 02:25:00.945]  More than 10 digit lead, a 16% lead over Giuliani in second place.
[02:25:02.626 --> 02:25:06.029]  Only a few times a month, 35% favor Ron Paul.
[02:25:06.669 --> 02:25:08.510]  Never 31% favor Ron Paul.
[02:25:08.750 --> 02:25:10.752]  So in every demographic he wins?
[02:25:11.192 --> 02:25:12.793]  It's pretty close to the other polls, yeah.
[02:25:12.893 --> 02:25:14.874]  Every demographic, he totally dominates.
[02:25:15.435 --> 02:25:20.338]  Except for some reason a few times a week, which is a very, very small percentage here.
[02:25:22.150 --> 02:25:22.890]  This is amazing.
[02:25:22.950 --> 02:25:27.152]  He's won in every major religious demographic, except Jewish, and they're just saying not sure.
[02:25:27.192 --> 02:25:27.893]  They're waiting.
[02:25:28.933 --> 02:25:30.994]  We have, I mean, this is incredible.
[02:25:31.034 --> 02:25:40.119]  We have him winning everywhere across the board, except in one place, and that was in a blind bio when they were told what he stood for.
[02:25:40.159 --> 02:25:51.464]  So he won in policies, but this showed what all the other polls are showing, and that's 5.4% when he's stacked up against the other candidates in a field when it's by name.
[02:25:53.166 --> 02:25:53.866]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:26:14.433 --> 02:26:17.276]  We actually would have polled them if there was a way to poll them properly.
[02:26:17.717 --> 02:26:19.398]  But I've looked into internet polling.
[02:26:19.719 --> 02:26:28.248]  They do internet polling at Zogby and other places, but they admit they do it from little catches of Republican and Democratic voters off phones, who they call via phones to set up to do it.
[02:26:28.929 --> 02:26:33.130]  And so, bottom line, the web is the big ball game now.
[02:26:33.670 --> 02:26:40.672]  So this is all skewed because they are still behind the times in mainstream media, and in mainstream polling, polling the phone systems.
[02:26:41.152 --> 02:26:45.854]  Yeah, I mean, that's why we can say these are telephone poll results, and not Internet.
[02:26:45.874 --> 02:26:47.174]  Which are skewed against Paul.
[02:26:47.214 --> 02:26:47.894]  That's key to add.
[02:26:47.934 --> 02:26:48.554]  That's been admitted.
[02:26:48.914 --> 02:26:49.455]  Yeah, it's true.
[02:26:49.475 --> 02:26:52.075]  So he wins, even with the deck stacked against him.
[02:26:52.495 --> 02:26:58.577]  Yeah, and you can see here, interestingly, that 84% of those polled have never used Facebook.
[02:27:00.803 --> 02:27:07.349]  Uh, 60% have never used YouTube, 71% have never used MySpace, and they still all favor Ron Paul.
[02:27:07.409 --> 02:27:11.634]  And so really what this poll does is it shows that these phone people are not internet people.
[02:27:12.412 --> 02:27:12.572]  Yeah.
[02:27:12.672 --> 02:27:13.392]  That's what it proves.
[02:27:13.612 --> 02:27:13.972]  I think so.
[02:27:14.012 --> 02:27:16.633]  I mean, it shows that's a big issue here, too.
[02:27:16.893 --> 02:27:17.873]  That it's two different worlds.
[02:27:17.913 --> 02:27:27.795]  Then you add the number between 70 and 90 percent that the federal government even puts out about internet connectivity and users, and it shows that the internet is the majority, and he's the winner on the web.
[02:27:27.975 --> 02:27:32.235]  So Ron Paul is the Republican frontrunner, and this poll shows the only man that can beat Hillary.
[02:27:32.255 --> 02:27:33.516]  Aaron Dykes, good job.
[02:27:33.796 --> 02:27:34.096]  Thank you.
[02:27:34.876 --> 02:27:35.996]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.276 --> 02:27:37.916]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.936 --> 02:27:41.497]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.373 --> 02:27:47.213]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:27:47.353 --> 02:27:54.035]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:27:54.315 --> 02:28:02.477]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:28:02.697 --> 02:28:08.438]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:28:08.598 --> 02:28:10.379]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:28:10.460 --> 02:28:12.601]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:28:12.741 --> 02:28:17.025]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:28:17.165 --> 02:28:19.287]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:28:19.387 --> 02:28:27.153]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:28:27.193 --> 02:28:28.054]  We're good to go.
[02:28:45.129 --> 02:28:48.471]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[02:28:48.772 --> 02:28:53.795]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[02:28:54.195 --> 02:28:59.339]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:28:59.559 --> 02:29:00.159]  Here's why.
[02:29:00.360 --> 02:29:08.285]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[02:29:08.305 --> 02:29:08.905]  I think so.
[02:29:27.517 --> 02:29:27.717]  We're good.
[02:29:44.868 --> 02:29:45.769]  Storable food!
[02:29:45.989 --> 02:29:46.849]  Storable food!
[02:29:47.010 --> 02:29:51.052]  HempUSA.org has an inexpensive, nutritionally dense, high-frequency food.
[02:29:51.212 --> 02:30:02.299]  Hemp, known around the world, will boost your immune system and increase energy levels, detoxifies the body and reduces junk food cravings, burns fat and builds muscle, and is easy to digest, non-allergenic, and gluten-free.
[02:30:02.419 --> 02:30:06.382]  Can be made into smoothies, breads, muffins, pancakes, cookies, you name it!
[02:30:06.562 --> 02:30:09.224]  The entire planet should make this a staple food in their diet.
[02:30:09.364 --> 02:30:11.085]  The seeds will scrape the colon wall.
[02:30:11.185 --> 02:30:13.126]  The powder will feed the body vital minerals.
[02:30:13.326 --> 02:30:13.646]  I think so.
[02:30:33.456 --> 02:30:35.640]  And this would make a perfect gift for friends and family.
[02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:40.308]  Call today, 908-691-2608 at hempusa.org.
[02:30:40.469 --> 02:30:44.015]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[02:31:06.178 --> 02:31:13.541]  Every major trend shows that the establishment has blown their cover and is universally hated by 89% of the American people.
[02:31:15.201 --> 02:31:20.063]  Classical liberals are now identifying with every major core conservative issue.
[02:31:20.103 --> 02:31:22.324]  Conservatives are now identifying with liberal issues.
[02:31:22.904 --> 02:31:25.445]  The people are ceasing to be divided.
[02:31:25.465 --> 02:31:29.647]  They are coming together under true constitutional populism.
[02:31:31.437 --> 02:31:36.019]  This is a major political realignment that we are witnessing in this country.
[02:31:36.039 --> 02:31:45.882]  The establishment, and the Rand Corporation and others have stated it, is coming in with everything they've got to block the people from coming together and to try to set up a police state.
[02:31:45.922 --> 02:31:48.783]  What did Perez Musharraf do when he declared himself dictator?
[02:31:48.803 --> 02:31:52.564]  The people that run our government put him in in 99, gave him nuclear weapons.
[02:31:52.584 --> 02:31:53.605]  That's mainstream news.
[02:31:53.645 --> 02:31:56.686]  They're funding him right now, acting like they're upset about what he's doing.
[02:31:57.375 --> 02:31:58.836]  The people say, we want you out of here!
[02:31:59.416 --> 02:32:08.579]  And he clamps down and says, I'm gonna arrest 50-something thousand people in suits and ties and every lawyer in the country and every opposition person in the country that informed me!
[02:32:10.599 --> 02:32:14.441]  And then what's Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and Limbaugh saying?
[02:32:14.521 --> 02:32:16.021]  Arrest Ron Paul supporters!
[02:32:16.301 --> 02:32:17.202]  We're terrorists!
[02:32:17.242 --> 02:32:18.322]  We're aiding Al Qaeda!
[02:32:18.342 --> 02:32:20.643]  We're in bed with Islamo-fascists!
[02:32:22.864 --> 02:32:26.825]  And everywhere you go, cops walk up and say, turn your camera off, while they mount cameras against us!
[02:32:30.259 --> 02:32:31.060]  We've got a case of that.
[02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:50.352]  I'm going to spend a few minutes with him here in just a moment, but before we go any further, if you believe in what you hear on this broadcast and if you research what we're saying, you need to take a step further and not just know the information yourself and think that it's going to spread through the ether by osmosis or something.
[02:32:50.812 --> 02:32:58.177]  I'm begging you to go to I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S dot com or TruthNews.us.
[02:33:00.746 --> 02:33:03.268]  Or InfoWars.net or JonesReport.com.
[02:33:04.229 --> 02:33:20.222]  And to go get the videos that I've made, End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement, you want to understand how much the people running our society hate you, how they're poisoning us, how they're killing us, how they stage wars, how they're sterilizing you, how they're engaged in biochemical attacks through the vaccines and the water against you.
[02:33:20.642 --> 02:33:22.664]  End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement proves it!
[02:33:22.864 --> 02:33:23.625]  It's all public!
[02:33:23.645 --> 02:33:24.786]  That's the incredible thing!
[02:33:27.819 --> 02:33:29.999]  And we're friends to the military and the police.
[02:33:30.019 --> 02:33:35.461]  That's why Ron Paul gets more money than all Republican candidates combined from the military.
[02:33:37.241 --> 02:33:38.741]  The truth is, the military is good.
[02:33:39.101 --> 02:33:40.782]  The truth is, most cops are good.
[02:33:41.062 --> 02:33:42.802]  But bad policies have been put in.
[02:33:43.182 --> 02:33:44.642]  And they've been put in bad positions.
[02:33:46.143 --> 02:33:49.123]  You've got a lot of idiots that are police just like there's a lot of idiots in the public.
[02:33:49.163 --> 02:33:50.423]  The society's degenerating.
[02:33:50.743 --> 02:33:53.144]  By design, I have the Department of Education documents.
[02:33:55.439 --> 02:33:59.142]  I want you to go to InfoWars.com and I want you to order Endgame.
[02:33:59.362 --> 02:34:02.505]  And I want you to get it discounted down to ten bucks a piece and order a bunch of them.
[02:34:02.785 --> 02:34:05.887]  And I want you to give it to everybody in your family and say, here's your Christmas present early.
[02:34:06.848 --> 02:34:08.289]  And we want you to make copies of it.
[02:34:08.649 --> 02:34:15.995]  If you've already got Endgame, folks, if you haven't already bought a DVD burner, and if you aren't savagely making copies of this, I don't know what you're doing.
[02:34:16.721 --> 02:34:18.382]  Get Loose Change Final Edition.
[02:34:18.863 --> 02:34:19.503]  Final Cut.
[02:34:19.563 --> 02:34:19.923]  Available.
[02:34:19.963 --> 02:34:21.564]  Incredible film at InfoWars.com.
[02:34:21.584 --> 02:34:25.867]  You can get end game discounted when you get it with Loose Change Final Cut.
[02:34:26.608 --> 02:34:28.729]  InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:29.710 --> 02:34:36.074]  If I get enough orders, by the way, plus that's a solution, getting the word out, I'm going to go get another pull.
[02:34:37.921 --> 02:34:43.665]  And this time, as a scientific test, it's not going to be, quote, fair, meaning skewed to the other candidates and Ron Paul still wins.
[02:34:43.785 --> 02:34:49.689]  I'm going to try to make them spin it, just to show people the results you can get with the other cheating candidates and what they've been paying for.
[02:34:49.709 --> 02:34:54.752]  I will take one of their other published polls that has been spun, but the public never reads the actual poll.
[02:34:54.772 --> 02:34:57.214]  They just hear the, you know, the boiled-down synopsis.
[02:34:58.795 --> 02:35:04.819]  And I am going to take that, and I am going to just put it into Ron Paul's words as an example.
[02:35:04.839 --> 02:35:06.140]  And I'll just announce it up front!
[02:35:07.521 --> 02:35:07.661]  See?
[02:35:09.079 --> 02:35:10.500]  We played fair and won.

[02:35:14.423 --> 02:35:15.844]  I don't know if I'll get the money to do that though.
[02:35:17.245 --> 02:35:21.388]  When these stories come out in the next few hours, I want you to blast them to the four corners of the planet.
[02:35:22.609 --> 02:35:25.230]  Zogby's gonna have their spin, their boil down of this datum.
[02:35:26.051 --> 02:35:26.591]  This data.

[02:35:34.957 --> 02:35:35.818]  They were on back order.
[02:35:37.435 --> 02:35:38.175]  It's just all there.

[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:29.964]  I want to get into martial law, the police state, and I'll have to do a part two on this tomorrow because Steve Watson's done such a great job in this report, turning the police state apparatus against the sinners.
[02:36:30.464 --> 02:36:31.725]  It's a lot more than just that.
[02:36:31.965 --> 02:36:35.047]  His headline belies incredible research and scholarly work here.
[02:36:36.457 --> 02:36:42.100]  This is one of the most important pieces, single pieces of information I've ever seen, and you need to look at it in total.
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:44.081]  Even I, grasping it in total, was shocked.
[02:36:44.901 --> 02:36:46.302]  And I'm fully immersed in this.
[02:36:47.062 --> 02:36:51.724]  I'm literally in the battle cockpit, ladies and gentlemen, just firing on enemy targets in the Info War.
[02:36:53.925 --> 02:37:02.289]  Jeff Becker, I remember Pastor Butch is a preacher, popular preacher in West Virginia, National Radio Show, here on Genesis Week Nights 8 to 9 Central.
[02:37:03.507 --> 02:37:08.171]  And I remember him talking about how he hired a professional fellow to go out and get him on the ballot.
[02:37:09.512 --> 02:37:23.504]  We've had this in Austin, it's been in the news, where we're trying to block toll roads and police walk up and threaten to arrest people when they're on the sidewalk because they're told to, or where the city officials walk up with wads of cash and try to buy people in front of the news cameras.
[02:37:23.524 --> 02:37:24.625]  I mean, that's how nuts they are.
[02:37:25.206 --> 02:37:26.006]  They arrested him.
[02:37:28.743 --> 02:37:30.043]  Becker over the weekend.
[02:37:30.664 --> 02:37:44.907]  Butch called in, and Butch was the guy that called me two years ago and said, hey, I got FEMA documents from two different preachers, and one of them is willing to come on the show about how preachers have been recruited to report inoculations and tell their flock to go to FEMA camps and be broken up and rounded up and to accept martial law.
[02:37:45.187 --> 02:37:49.708]  And then three months ago, you heard mainstream newscasts reporting and admitting it.
[02:37:50.128 --> 02:37:52.889]  So Butch is always very accurate with the info he brings us in.
[02:37:52.909 --> 02:37:54.069]  This happened to his campaign.
[02:37:54.369 --> 02:37:55.110]  This happened to him.
[02:37:55.170 --> 02:37:56.390]  And he just called in with this.
[02:37:57.626 --> 02:38:00.648]  And they arrested him, folks, for being out there getting signatures.
[02:38:01.149 --> 02:38:02.190]  This is the new America.
[02:38:02.450 --> 02:38:04.511]  Jeff, just in a nutshell, tell folks what happened to you.
[02:38:05.472 --> 02:38:08.274]  First of all, Alex, it's a huge honor to speak to you.
[02:38:08.814 --> 02:38:09.775]  I appreciate you having me on.
[02:38:09.815 --> 02:38:10.556]  Good to talk to you, sir.
[02:38:10.596 --> 02:38:11.697]  Tell us what happened.
[02:38:11.757 --> 02:38:23.525]  Well, as you mentioned, yes, I'm active with the West Virginia Constitution Party, and we're doing petitioning for ballot access for Pastor Blitz and other candidates, and it's kind of a daunting task.
[02:38:24.781 --> 02:38:28.102]  Collect 15,000 valid signatures.
[02:38:28.402 --> 02:38:31.964]  And if people weren't helping you before in West Virginia, they better come to your aid now.
[02:38:32.004 --> 02:38:32.964]  This is the Alamo.
[02:38:33.084 --> 02:38:34.005]  They've arrested you.
[02:38:34.065 --> 02:38:34.825]  Tell them what happened.
[02:38:35.785 --> 02:38:48.370]  Well, we're following the state election laws, and according to state election laws, we're allowed to, it says, we're allowed to... You're not allowed to, it's your God-given right.
[02:38:48.610 --> 02:38:53.572]  Well, you're right, but we're following the state election law, even though it's of
[02:38:54.235 --> 02:38:54.956]  It's intimidation.
[02:38:55.316 --> 02:38:57.378]  We have these credential forms from every county.
[02:38:57.398 --> 02:39:02.082]  It's a piece of paper that's... First Amendment says you have a right to petition.
[02:39:02.262 --> 02:39:09.389]  They're not allowed to see, but see, first they say it's a form, which is a license to turn something that is criminal into something that's permitted.
[02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:10.069]  But go ahead.
[02:39:10.089 --> 02:39:10.209]  Right.
[02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:11.050]  Well, let me explain.
[02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:17.496]  See, in my home county, I'm out here visiting my parents, other side of the state, and where I normally do petitioning,
[02:39:19.258 --> 02:39:24.720]  Ostensibly, you know, on the sidewalk, inevitably a Republican or a Democrat doesn't like what I'm doing.
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:28.341]  They complain to whoever owns the store.
[02:39:28.441 --> 02:39:30.362]  This is the Nazi Tattletale Society.
[02:39:30.422 --> 02:39:30.922]  Tell folks.
[02:39:31.202 --> 02:39:45.907]  They complain, then they call the cops, and the cops come out, and I show them the credential form from my county that's from the county clerk, and they say, okay, fine, and sometimes I have to have the last word, and they tell me I have to, I had, well, you know, take your foot off the grass, that you're both, you have to be on the sidewalk.
[02:39:46.750 --> 02:39:46.990]  Okay.
[02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:48.792]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens, let me stop you.
[02:39:48.812 --> 02:40:00.781]  Illegal aliens are running around murdering and killing and being given driver's licenses and sucking welfare and everything else, but that's okay, and $4 trillion is missing from the Pentagon, and wall-to-wall corruption everywhere, but we've got to stop you from First Amendment.
[02:40:01.302 --> 02:40:04.604]  Yeah, it's intimidating, but I'm willing to put up with it.
[02:40:04.624 --> 02:40:08.107]  I have the paperwork, I'm following the state law, I have the law with me.
[02:40:08.407 --> 02:40:14.112]  But here in Pakistan... Three or four times in the past, when the police came,
[02:40:15.057 --> 02:40:16.038]  I had no problem with them.
[02:40:16.078 --> 02:40:19.860]  They were actually understanding, and I was not intimidated by them.
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:33.008]  So in this case, now, it was a holiday, holiday, heh, okay, it was a Christmas, they called it a holiday, arts and crafts show, at a public school, a middle school in Long Healy County.
[02:40:33.808 --> 02:40:36.970]  And I was on the sidewalk entranceway.
[02:40:37.150 --> 02:40:38.291]  The public school was a Sunday.
[02:40:38.311 --> 02:40:40.052]  The school was not in session.
[02:40:40.072 --> 02:40:41.333]  The school was open to the public.
[02:40:41.373 --> 02:40:42.994]  Hundreds of people were coming in and buying their
[02:40:43.564 --> 02:40:43.924]  We're good to go.
[02:41:12.881 --> 02:41:17.203]  Walked by several times and said hello and didn't bother me.
[02:41:17.604 --> 02:41:19.365]  So tell us in a nutshell what happened, please.
[02:41:19.425 --> 02:41:25.548]  It was only two hours later that the principal then said that I had to leave, that I was harassing people.
[02:41:26.368 --> 02:41:35.213]  And I said, well, I have this, I'm on the sidewalk, I have the credential form, I think I'm allowed to be here and you're going to call the cops.
[02:41:35.934 --> 02:41:41.817]  I said, well, fine, because that hasn't, in the past, the police have looked at this form and I've been allowed to stay.
[02:41:42.697 --> 02:41:47.501]  The officer arrived, came up to me, and I tried to show him the form, and he said, do you have any ID?
[02:41:47.521 --> 02:41:51.504]  And I said, yes, but I have a credential form.
[02:41:51.544 --> 02:41:52.945]  Show me your ID or I'm going to arrest you.
[02:41:52.965 --> 02:41:55.287]  I said, well, I don't want to be arrested.
[02:41:55.327 --> 02:41:56.528]  I'm willing to leave.
[02:41:56.548 --> 02:41:58.809]  I have the form here, but it's very intimidating.
[02:41:58.829 --> 02:42:03.593]  You know, as you've mentioned, these guys are in their black suits and, you know, black uniforms and sunglasses on.
[02:42:03.793 --> 02:42:04.814]  Talk right into your telephone.
[02:42:06.556 --> 02:42:08.657]  So I kind of caved in.
[02:42:09.037 --> 02:42:11.318]  I opened up my wallet and I pulled out my military ID.
[02:42:11.358 --> 02:42:12.759]  I didn't want to give him my driver's license.
[02:42:12.799 --> 02:42:14.139]  I'm in the air guard.
[02:42:14.159 --> 02:42:17.380]  I gave him my military ID and he said, give me your driver's license.
[02:42:18.641 --> 02:42:22.182]  I said, well, this doesn't have anything to do with my driving.
[02:42:22.243 --> 02:42:25.504]  He said, give me your driver's license or I'm going to arrest you.
[02:42:29.149 --> 02:42:29.950]  Not to Germany.
[02:42:29.990 --> 02:42:31.371]  Give me your papers, you're arrested.
[02:42:31.411 --> 02:42:32.132]  What happens now?
[02:42:32.152 --> 02:42:33.113]  I didn't want to give my driver's license.
[02:42:33.133 --> 02:42:35.175]  If my driver's license is expired, I need to get that renewed.
[02:42:35.195 --> 02:42:36.196]  I knew it was going to be an issue.
[02:42:36.216 --> 02:42:38.217]  Jeff, I want to hear all this, but just tell me what happened.
[02:42:38.298 --> 02:42:43.522]  I gave him my driver's license, and then he agreed to let me, he gave me that back, he agreed to let me leave.
[02:42:43.542 --> 02:42:55.793]  He said, you know, to call somebody to pick you up, so I used the principal's cell phone, called my mother, she was going to come and get me.
[02:42:56.383 --> 02:42:59.426]  He said, let's go stand over there by the patrol car on the curb.
[02:42:59.446 --> 02:43:08.553]  So I walked over there, and then the officer came over there, and after about, not even 30 seconds, he said, how long is it going to take for her to get here?
[02:43:08.854 --> 02:43:10.035]  And I said, probably about an hour.
[02:43:10.155 --> 02:43:11.536]  And he said, he just went ballistic.
[02:43:11.576 --> 02:43:12.297]  He says, an hour?
[02:43:12.317 --> 02:43:13.458]  I said, yeah.
[02:43:13.538 --> 02:43:14.378]  He says, where does she live?
[02:43:14.418 --> 02:43:15.579]  I said, the other side of the county.
[02:43:16.140 --> 02:43:18.382]  At this point, he started asking me all kinds of personal questions.
[02:43:18.462 --> 02:43:19.363]  You know, how old are you?
[02:43:19.383 --> 02:43:20.323]  Do you live at home?
[02:43:20.483 --> 02:43:20.964]  Are you married?
[02:43:21.861 --> 02:43:33.411]  They started asking me questions about my military, you know, what rank are you, what unit are you in, what's your AFSC job classification, you know, what do you do, all the stuff.
[02:43:33.992 --> 02:43:39.617]  I said, you know, I said, I'm, that's alright, I'll leave, I'll walk off, I'll go over here.
[02:43:39.637 --> 02:43:40.378]  I started walking away.
[02:43:40.398 --> 02:43:42.880]  He said, don't turn around, don't turn your back on me or I'll arrest you.
[02:43:44.327 --> 02:43:45.408]  So it's all about power.
[02:43:45.428 --> 02:43:48.409]  Let me just stop you.
[02:43:48.429 --> 02:43:49.749]  This is how our veterans are treated.
[02:43:49.769 --> 02:43:51.010]  This is how they're treated coming back.
[02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:52.651]  This is what our country's turned into.
[02:43:52.671 --> 02:43:54.891]  Go ahead.
[02:43:54.911 --> 02:43:56.852]  Well, I mean, I wouldn't answer his questions.
[02:43:56.892 --> 02:43:58.053]  I said, I don't have to answer his questions.
[02:43:58.093 --> 02:43:58.753]  He said, yes, you do.
[02:43:58.833 --> 02:44:00.894]  I said, I plead the Fifth Amendment.
[02:44:00.954 --> 02:44:02.214]  He says, this is not a court of law.
[02:44:02.234 --> 02:44:03.475]  I'm conducting an investigation.
[02:44:04.666 --> 02:44:06.447]  He wanted to know where my car was.
[02:44:06.527 --> 02:44:09.208]  We're not answering questions in the Fifth Amendment.
[02:44:09.468 --> 02:44:11.689]  He arrested you and you've now been charged with obstruction.
[02:44:11.989 --> 02:44:14.790]  I've been charged with trespassing, disorderly conduct, and obstruction.
[02:44:16.351 --> 02:44:16.511]  Right.
[02:44:17.872 --> 02:44:18.272]  Handcuffed.
[02:44:18.652 --> 02:44:21.353]  Well, that guy, you know, you talk about bad karma.
[02:44:21.393 --> 02:44:23.794]  That guy is just so cursed for what he's done.
[02:44:23.834 --> 02:44:24.695]  He better repent of it.
[02:44:24.715 --> 02:44:27.616]  This is just... So, how did he arrest you?
[02:44:27.636 --> 02:44:29.837]  He grabbed me.
[02:44:29.877 --> 02:44:31.798]  He told me he was going to arrest me and I didn't...
[02:44:33.393 --> 02:44:34.513]  I had no intention of resisting.
[02:44:34.533 --> 02:44:38.615]  He took my arm, put it behind my back, handcuffed me, and put me in the back of the patrol car.
[02:44:38.675 --> 02:44:40.876]  Was the crowd pleased at the destruction of America?
[02:44:42.096 --> 02:44:43.237]  Most of the crowd was inside.
[02:44:43.257 --> 02:44:44.317]  No, I didn't.
[02:44:44.658 --> 02:44:46.078]  But was the principal happy?
[02:44:46.758 --> 02:44:48.399]  I didn't see him.
[02:44:48.619 --> 02:44:50.480]  So how long were you in jail for your great evil?
[02:44:50.500 --> 02:44:51.120]  I wasn't in jail.
[02:44:51.140 --> 02:44:54.461]  They took me out of the police station, and we posted a bond.
[02:44:55.202 --> 02:44:57.383]  Did you ask him, why are you giving me false charges?
[02:44:57.403 --> 02:44:58.183]  No.
[02:44:58.203 --> 02:44:59.844]  These guys, they had this
[02:45:01.306 --> 02:45:01.826]  I don't think so.
[02:45:23.239 --> 02:45:36.722]  And they have no empathy that you're a human being, that they could ruin your life, that you're going to get in a lot of trouble in the air guard, that just, hey, this guy's evil, this guy didn't fully lick boots, and so he's got to pay.
[02:45:37.142 --> 02:45:37.322]  Right.
[02:45:37.842 --> 02:45:46.484]  Give us some contact info, or specifically how we can help you, or how people can help you go out and petition, and how we can stand up against this evil.
[02:45:46.544 --> 02:45:47.844]  I mean, when's your first court date?
[02:45:48.765 --> 02:45:50.225]  It's December 19th, Wednesday at 3.30.
[02:45:51.528 --> 02:45:53.490]  Okay, well listen, I've got to let you go.
[02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:57.653]  As this develops, we'll get you back on as it happens, but there's an ocean of this happening.
[02:45:59.595 --> 02:46:00.576]  Any contact info?
[02:46:02.497 --> 02:46:10.844]  You can go to our website, cpwv.org, for the Constitution Party of West Virginia, and then there's an email there for info if you want to help petition.
[02:46:11.304 --> 02:46:11.945]  There's numbers there.
[02:46:12.699 --> 02:46:15.381]  Well, I'm sorry this happened to you, but this is the New World Order, sir.
[02:46:16.102 --> 02:46:17.283]  I appreciate you, Mr. Becker.
[02:46:17.323 --> 02:46:17.623]  Take care.
[02:46:17.643 --> 02:46:17.844]  Thanks.
[02:46:17.984 --> 02:46:18.724]  Good talking to you, Alex.
[02:46:19.085 --> 02:46:21.207]  Yeah, and I was frustrated going through him quick.
[02:46:21.247 --> 02:46:23.609]  He's a very nice, gentlemanly, humble person, Bush told me.
[02:46:23.629 --> 02:46:25.230]  But now I can't cover this.
[02:46:26.031 --> 02:46:27.212]  This is martial law news.
[02:46:27.572 --> 02:46:30.415]  But see, there is an indication of the martial law right there.
[02:46:31.536 --> 02:46:33.197]  That's what martial law is.
[02:46:33.257 --> 02:46:36.500]  I don't care if you got a permit to be out here petitioning when you don't even need a permit.
[02:46:37.261 --> 02:46:38.222]  I don't care if there's no law.
[02:46:38.242 --> 02:46:39.162]  You don't have to take vaccines.
[02:46:39.182 --> 02:46:39.803]  We're going to arrest you.
[02:46:40.544 --> 02:46:40.984]  I don't care.
[02:46:41.004 --> 02:46:45.327]  I don't care if your $2 bills are real and you're trying to buy stuff at Best Buy.
[02:46:45.347 --> 02:46:47.528]  You know, five cops responded.
[02:46:47.549 --> 02:46:54.313]  There were more than ten people at the Best Buy, and none of them knew that the $2 bill, the Declaration of Independence signing on it, was a real money.
[02:46:54.413 --> 02:46:55.934]  They just said, that's it, you're arrested.
[02:46:58.696 --> 02:47:00.016]  See, that's how this works now.
[02:47:00.277 --> 02:47:02.158]  I mean, people are getting arrested for real U.S.
[02:47:02.218 --> 02:47:03.719]  money, for actual silver dollars.
[02:47:03.919 --> 02:47:07.261]  They're a Federal Reserve, but in the coin they know, they arrest you.
[02:47:08.144 --> 02:47:08.965]  Using something else there.
[02:47:09.045 --> 02:47:10.446]  It's just arrest, arrest, arrest.
[02:47:10.826 --> 02:47:14.189]  Gotta arrest everybody except the illegal aliens and all the corrupt politicians.
[02:47:17.051 --> 02:47:21.854]  And this report, you know what, tomorrow, some day this week, I'm gonna read this whole thing.
[02:47:22.375 --> 02:47:24.536]  Turning the police state apparatus against the sinners.
[02:47:25.977 --> 02:47:30.921]  And it goes through how they're trying to set this up for the media to say anybody that disagrees with the government is a terrorist.
[02:47:31.585 --> 02:47:56.609]  It goes into executive orders, HR 6166 Military Commissions Act, all the articles and law professors backing that up, John Warner Defense Authorization Act, Marshall Law Presidential Directive 51, National Security Homeland Security Presidential Directive, the USA Patriot Act 1 and 2, getting rid of the Posse Comitatus Act, breaks down how they've done that illegally, former Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge,
[02:47:57.426 --> 02:48:19.115]  I was saying the same thing about martial law, clips of FEMA threatening police that all Christians are terrorists, the Founding Fathers were bad, urban warfare, threatening to take our guns, Special Operations Command, JCSOC, the NORTHCOM system, Military Affairs Analyst William Arkham covering it, police state infrastructure already in place, FEMA NORTHCOM, tools of tyranny,
[02:48:19.887 --> 02:48:21.428]  And it just goes through all of it.
[02:48:21.508 --> 02:48:24.051]  FEMA deliberately sabotaged release efforts in New Orleans.
[02:48:24.551 --> 02:48:26.573]  Long history of incompetence, criminality.
[02:48:26.593 --> 02:48:30.055]  It goes on for page after page, breaking down everything they're doing.
[02:48:31.457 --> 02:48:33.378]  That was one page, there's 13 pages of it.
[02:48:34.079 --> 02:48:35.260]  I just, they're coming down on us.
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:39.543]  The global corporations have taken control of the government, and they're training us to be total slaves right now.
[02:48:39.563 --> 02:48:43.747]  We'll be right back with more.
[02:48:45.308 --> 02:48:46.709]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.790 --> 02:48:48.791]  A new world order.
[02:48:49.537 --> 02:48:54.680]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:54.740 --> 02:48:57.302]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:57.322 --> 02:48:59.483]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:49:00.044 --> 02:49:02.485]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.226 --> 02:49:10.890]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:13.572 --> 02:49:18.535]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.015 --> 02:49:22.476]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:22.876 --> 02:49:25.397]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[02:49:25.437 --> 02:49:26.578]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:26.598 --> 02:49:27.378]  They're not after money.
[02:49:27.398 --> 02:49:28.458]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:28.678 --> 02:49:29.418]  They're after power.
[02:49:29.638 --> 02:49:30.679]  That's what they're after, you see.
[02:49:30.819 --> 02:49:35.340]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:38.981]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:49:42.323 --> 02:49:43.463]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.896 --> 02:49:46.958]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:47.258 --> 02:49:50.063]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:50.323 --> 02:49:54.489]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:54.910 --> 02:49:55.751]  So what do you do?
[02:49:56.052 --> 02:50:00.639]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:01.099 --> 02:50:03.240]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:04.600]  Sheltering in Place!
[02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:18.403]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:18.463 --> 02:50:25.505]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:50:25.865 --> 02:50:30.270]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:50:30.731 --> 02:50:32.493]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:32.513 --> 02:50:32.733]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:32.813 --> 02:50:34.295]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:50:43.965 --> 02:50:44.626]  It's a fact.
[02:50:44.846 --> 02:50:52.338]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:50:52.458 --> 02:50:58.968]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt.
[02:50:59.048 --> 02:50:59.509]  I'm good.
[02:51:18.667 --> 02:51:23.669]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:51:23.870 --> 02:51:28.372]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:51:28.512 --> 02:51:30.313]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:51:30.333 --> 02:51:30.533]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:51:30.553 --> 02:51:30.933]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:51:30.953 --> 02:51:32.254]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:51:32.274 --> 02:51:32.974]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[02:52:08.275 --> 02:52:14.799]  We're witnessing the total federalization of this republic.
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:24.205]  In the first hour I detailed all the vaccine fraud that's going on and how they herded people in under fraud and color of law and forcibly inoculated them.
[02:52:24.225 --> 02:52:26.526]  They believed they were under duress and they were under duress.
[02:52:28.147 --> 02:52:29.628]  That's coming up in the first hour.
[02:52:30.488 --> 02:52:31.489]  It'll retransmit.
[02:52:32.159 --> 02:52:36.122]  Come on up here in just about five minutes at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:36.162 --> 02:52:41.805]  If you missed any of that, you can go to InfoWars.com and we'll restream the show right there on the mainstream.
[02:52:42.406 --> 02:52:50.871]  And then in the second hour, we detail the Ron Paul poll showing him winning in every major religious group, winning with the military, winning everywhere we funded this poll.
[02:52:51.272 --> 02:52:52.913]  We're going to publish the results of that poll.
[02:52:53.973 --> 02:53:10.938]  In the next few hours and articles are going to be on TruthNews.us, PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com, Infowars.net, all of our writers, because there's so many questions in the poll, so many sub-datas of who they question, who they talk to, just amazing.
[02:53:10.958 --> 02:53:12.278]  This is, quote, a fair poll.
[02:53:12.418 --> 02:53:15.479]  Most of the others are skewed against Paul, but they find similar things.
[02:53:15.959 --> 02:53:17.660]  So this is really a big deal.
[02:53:20.201 --> 02:53:21.441]  On the subject of martial law,
[02:53:23.900 --> 02:53:28.982]  I had all these mainstream news articles printed out admitting it and pushing it and saying how great it is, some saying how bad it is.
[02:53:31.323 --> 02:53:52.730]  And tomorrow, I'm going to take an hour out sometime to just read all of this, but I do hope you'll go to Infowars.net or in the News and Focus section on PrisonPlanet.com and read the story, Special Report, Turning the Police State Apparatus Against the Center's Second Major Phase of Courting the Destruction of Freedom in America Targets Those Who Refuse to Go Along with It.
[02:53:55.797 --> 02:53:59.098]  But the good news is the people are waking up and are not buying into it.
[02:53:59.118 --> 02:54:01.839]  So get really aggressive in the info war.
[02:54:01.919 --> 02:54:03.399]  People are ready to hear the truth now.
[02:54:03.439 --> 02:54:04.520]  They know something's wrong.
[02:54:04.580 --> 02:54:07.841]  They know that, hey, 90 plus percent of us want to control the borders.
[02:54:07.881 --> 02:54:08.421]  You won't do it.
[02:54:08.441 --> 02:54:11.722]  80 plus percent of us don't want the war, but you do it.
[02:54:12.682 --> 02:54:15.163]  The vast majority of us don't like either party, but you got it.
[02:54:15.423 --> 02:54:18.344]  We sent the Democrats to Congress to stop it, and they just intensify it.
[02:54:19.004 --> 02:54:21.265]  The people now know the truth.
[02:54:21.992 --> 02:54:23.193]  And be part of history.
[02:54:23.333 --> 02:54:27.216]  There's no doubt that history is being made right now that we're in a clear sea change.
[02:54:27.576 --> 02:54:29.718]  Will it go into total tyranny or back into liberty?
[02:54:30.410 --> 02:54:31.871]  You are going to decide that.
[02:54:31.891 --> 02:54:34.513]  It is not going to be the elite cockroaches that are going to decide that.
[02:54:34.974 --> 02:54:36.315]  It is us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:36.795 --> 02:54:39.097]  And make no mistake, don't let history pass you by.
[02:54:39.177 --> 02:54:46.082]  Don't not be involved in the Second American Revolution, a restoration of our Bill of Rights and Declaration of Independence.
[02:54:46.242 --> 02:54:52.627]  Read the Declaration of Independence about a long train of abuses inevitably leading to the same thing.
[02:54:52.967 --> 02:54:59.452]  Total despotism, abuse, swarms of bureaucracies and new offices sent forth to eat out our substance.
[02:55:00.185 --> 02:55:01.727]  That's exactly what's happening now.
[02:55:03.489 --> 02:55:09.135]  And realize that there's a very small global elite that's playing us off against each other and driving all this forward.
[02:55:09.996 --> 02:55:15.402]  If you don't get involved in the fight, things are going to get very, very serious very, very fast.
[02:55:16.784 --> 02:55:20.748]  If you don't take action and speak up and get involved,
[02:55:22.501 --> 02:55:23.662]  And make your voice heard.
[02:55:24.162 --> 02:55:25.643]  It does count to hear your voice heard.
[02:55:25.663 --> 02:55:27.304]  It does count to vote even if there's fraud.
[02:55:27.324 --> 02:55:28.044]  We'll expose that.
[02:55:28.604 --> 02:55:31.606]  It does count to educate your friends and family and neighbors.
[02:55:31.646 --> 02:55:36.008]  The establishment tells you you don't have power because you do have power, and they're scared to death of you.
[02:55:37.068 --> 02:55:45.533]  If you take the same energy of the Ron Paul revolution, who's joining us Wednesday, by the way, and you put that into getting in-game and making a thousand copies, you could do that in a year.
[02:55:45.593 --> 02:55:46.653]  Make three or four copies a day.
[02:55:47.374 --> 02:55:48.214]  Or a hundred copies.
[02:55:48.554 --> 02:55:49.715]  Make one copy every few days.
[02:55:50.476 --> 02:55:53.422]  Or if you go download copies at PrisonPlanet.tv and burn them to disk.
[02:55:53.882 --> 02:55:57.228]  The power of you taking action is unbelievable.
[02:55:57.529 --> 02:55:59.613]  We can move mountains with God's help together.
[02:56:00.450 --> 02:56:03.591]  So remember, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, is now out.
[02:56:04.051 --> 02:56:08.593]  And so is Loose Change, Final Cut, both available at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:56:08.693 --> 02:56:18.097]  Get aggressive, get fired up, realize that the solution is looking at you in the mirror, or defeat is looking at you in the mirror.
[02:56:18.377 --> 02:56:19.317]  That is up to you!
[02:56:19.978 --> 02:56:22.439]  Alright, retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:22.479 --> 02:56:23.179]  God bless you all.
[02:56:26.480 --> 02:56:28.361]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
