[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.441]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:08.162]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:09.983]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:11.444]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.205 --> 00:00:13.225]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:17.589]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.052]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.141 --> 00:00:36.525]  We are scheduled to have the heir to one of the biggest fortunes on earth in banking.
[00:00:39.507 --> 00:00:43.970]  Coming up later in this hour, David Mayer de Rothschild.
[00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:56.339]  And he is, of course, born in 1978, a British adventurer and environmentalist to his, the head of the Adventure Ecology and Expedition Group, raising awareness about climate change.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.341]  He is the youngest of the three children.
[00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:03.949]  of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild of the Rothschild Banking Family of England.
[00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:08.651]  So we are lined up to try to get him on the show.
[00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.352]  He's all over the press.
[00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:12.213]  It's saving the earth.
[00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:22.119]  It's just, imagine, Albuquerque saving the earth with, of course, global taxation and new regulatory plans for one-child policies.
[00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.821]  We're really blessed to have people like
[00:01:27.344 --> 00:01:35.751]  Lord Rothschild's son out there saving the earth and we're lined up to have him pop in later in the show.
[00:01:37.152 --> 00:01:39.094]  It has been a bad week for Al Gore.
[00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:51.944]  His man-made global warming myth has taken another battering as live earth propaganda bandwagon is derailed and the drug test and drug arrest puts another of the VP's hypocrisies in focus again.
[00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:54.506]  We'll be going over that report.
[00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:55.007]  Also,
[00:01:55.857 --> 00:02:14.865]  Al Gore has introduced a pledge, kind of a Mao-like pledge for the youth, where they sign a seven-point pledge to be the front-line jihadis in a move by the world government to bring in total taxation regulation and neo-feudalism.
[00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:32.244]  So we'll be discussing Al Gore on that front, because this is the biggest propaganda push on any one issue, even bigger than the phony war on terror that we have ever seen, and still the average person on the street is not aware of what's happening.
[00:02:32.604 --> 00:02:37.488]  Though in major polls, the vast majority of people do not believe global warming is man-made.
[00:02:39.611 --> 00:02:49.017]  Close to 60% do not believe that global warming is man-made in multiple major poles, and then a large portion of those people don't even believe that the Earth is warming.
[00:02:49.417 --> 00:03:07.248]  Though I think there is evidence that it is at least warming overall, and that that is a natural cycle, and that all human activity is literally a speck in the overall scheme of things compared to the Sun and the other intergalactic factors
[00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.711]  Bombarding the Earth.
[00:03:11.071 --> 00:03:14.892]  And that's what all the major scientific studies actually show.
[00:03:14.932 --> 00:03:15.793]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:24.115]  Climate change and man-made climate change is a hoax, a fraud, a swindle from all the scientific evidence I've seen.
[00:03:24.796 --> 00:03:26.156]  And we're here to just report the facts.
[00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:27.277]  We don't have an axe to grind.
[00:03:27.317 --> 00:03:28.817]  We go where the information is.
[00:03:29.577 --> 00:03:34.339]  But genetic engineering, cross-species types,
[00:03:35.467 --> 00:03:46.293]  And of course, much of the toxic waste dumping and things that are going on are very egregious, are very, very serious, and are affecting us right now, not just the planet.
[00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:51.716]  So we will discuss that later in the show as well.
[00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:57.900]  GOP Congressman joins Senator Domenici in breaking with White House on war.
[00:04:00.643 --> 00:04:02.343]  Also, there's a big exclusive out.
[00:04:02.403 --> 00:04:04.724]  Rupert Murdoch buys Dow Jones.
[00:04:04.884 --> 00:04:08.045]  Owners of the Wall Street Journal deny it.
[00:04:08.065 --> 00:04:19.587]  Of course, that's a move to see the stock soar so that the greedy board will go ahead and reverse themselves against the Bancroft family so they can get that done.
[00:04:19.607 --> 00:04:24.268]  Another dirty trick from Murdoch, but Murdoch's got CIA globalist
[00:04:25.137 --> 00:04:27.198]  Rothschild slash Rockefeller backing.
[00:04:27.238 --> 00:04:29.520]  He will probably get the Wall Street Journal.
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.521]  Of course, it won't matter.
[00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:34.924]  It will clearly lose any credibility it ever had, pretty much instantaneously.
[00:04:36.445 --> 00:04:39.447]  Also, Ohio newspaper under fire for outing gun owners.
[00:04:40.047 --> 00:04:41.208]  They need to be locked up.
[00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.490]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:53.276]  I'm Alex Jones, and we'll see if we can get our Rothschild friend from the House of Rothschild on with us.
[00:05:03.214 --> 00:05:04.235]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:05:04.575 --> 00:05:07.357]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:07.617 --> 00:05:11.779]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.040]  So what do you do?
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.923]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:05:18.403 --> 00:05:20.525]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:05:21.026 --> 00:05:21.906]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:35.719]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:42.826]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:47.590]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.792]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:49.812 --> 00:05:50.092]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:51.573]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:04.318 --> 00:06:04.779]  It's here.
[00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:09.787]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.148 --> 00:06:17.801]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:25.530]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:37.355]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.675 --> 00:06:41.597]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:43.558]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.898 --> 00:06:47.740]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.081 --> 00:07:04.024]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:04.184 --> 00:07:09.409]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:15.034]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.414 --> 00:07:16.535]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.916 --> 00:07:25.924]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:26.204 --> 00:07:27.826]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[00:07:28.046 --> 00:07:32.231]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:36.896]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:07:37.277 --> 00:07:39.379]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:07:41.101 --> 00:07:41.882]  Keep it natural.
[00:07:42.182 --> 00:07:50.346]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:50.607 --> 00:07:54.749]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:07:54.769 --> 00:07:55.850]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:02.623 --> 00:08:08.647]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.268 --> 00:08:12.310]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.491 --> 00:08:20.516]  Well, Al Gore has introduced a global pledge for the young people going to the concert.
[00:08:21.596 --> 00:08:24.939]  Loading on to the ships there at Wonderland.
[00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:31.224]  And we are joined by David Mayer de Rothschild.
[00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:36.390]  Al Gore, of course, is kicking off a string of global concerts this weekend on 777.
[00:08:39.259 --> 00:09:01.925]  And the man who's written the official book that is the accompaniment to this meant for elementary grade school children is David Mayer de Rothschild, born in 1978, a British adventurer, I love that title, an environmentalist who is the head of Adventure Ecology, an expedition group raising awareness about climate change
[00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:09.369]  He is the youngest of the three children of Sir Evelyn de Rothschild of the Rothschild Banking Family of England.
[00:09:10.169 --> 00:09:15.852]  One of the arrows shooting out across the planet, invigorating everything.
[00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:19.274]  Mr. Rothschild, thank you for coming on the show with us today.
[00:09:19.854 --> 00:09:20.895]  Thank you for having me on the show.
[00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:23.743]  That's quite an introduction there.
[00:09:23.803 --> 00:09:24.743]  Thank you.
[00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:25.244]  You bet.
[00:09:26.045 --> 00:09:40.136]  Now tell us why you, one of the young, vibrant heirs of one of the main arms of the Rothschild family, the House, is embarking on this selfless mission to save the Earth.
[00:09:41.709 --> 00:09:43.251]  It's a good question.
[00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:50.436]  I mean, I think for me, it's about saying, you know, this is the only issue that we should be contending with right now, because we only have one planet.
[00:09:50.597 --> 00:09:51.377]  This is our house.
[00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:58.463]  And without that, then all the other rooms in our house, which may be poverty or disease or conflict or whatever it may be,
[00:09:59.243 --> 00:10:08.666]  You know then we don't have those because without a house you have no rooms and so I think for me it's just I realized I was involved in an expedition to cross Antarctica four years ago.
[00:10:08.686 --> 00:10:23.790]  I followed the same route that rolled Amazon did to the South Pole and then I kited across the continent and during my three months on this Arctic landscape I realized that you know we were a having a huge effect on our fragile ecosystems as human beings but also that it was
[00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.251]  I've got a new poll out here.
[00:10:39.082 --> 00:10:46.089]  Morey poll shows that most people in the UK remain unconvinced about warnings that our climate is being affected by global warming.
[00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:54.578]  What is the science proving that man-made global warming, A, is real, and B, will cause cataclysmic problems?
[00:10:55.773 --> 00:11:04.660]  I think the report you really need to be looking at was a report that was released at the beginning of the year by the IPCC, which is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.344]  It's made up of two and a half thousand scientists from around the world, all in the field of climatic studies.
[00:11:10.744 --> 00:11:12.345]  These are the brains, basically.
[00:11:12.365 --> 00:11:15.508]  These are the guys who have been looking at this stuff for a very long time.
[00:11:15.528 --> 00:11:19.791]  You know, they come together, they put this report together, and there was a unanimous
[00:11:20.311 --> 00:11:21.112]  No, no, no, no.
[00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:42.371]  I think that if you read the report, they actually do.
[00:11:42.391 --> 00:11:46.854]  They come out and they say... No, they say their names were added falsely to that report.
[00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.135]  Are you aware of that global controversy?
[00:11:49.155 --> 00:11:50.356]  It's been in hundreds of newspapers.
[00:11:51.157 --> 00:12:01.003]  I think the fact of the matter is, this type of argument about whether global warming exists or not, is a waste of time.
[00:12:01.063 --> 00:12:03.025]  I mean, the fact of the matter is, we've got one planet.
[00:12:03.525 --> 00:12:06.227]  We're not doing, you know, all our systems are in degradation.
[00:12:07.008 --> 00:12:11.512]  We can argue about who's causing what, but there's no denying that our systems are A-shifting.
[00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:13.233]  I mean, look at your country right now.
[00:12:13.554 --> 00:12:14.955]  You've got floods in Texas.
[00:12:15.055 --> 00:12:17.036]  You've got 126 degrees in Arizona.
[00:12:17.056 --> 00:12:17.817]  You've got fires.
[00:12:17.857 --> 00:12:19.499]  You've got systems in England.
[00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:22.661]  We've had six of our annual rainfall in 24 hours.
[00:12:23.041 --> 00:12:24.523]  Well, there's always, you know, hold on.
[00:12:24.583 --> 00:12:25.844]  I've read quite a few history books.
[00:12:26.972 --> 00:12:36.400]  You know, even back at the time of Waterloo, when your family was so active, we've got all sorts of fires and storms and floods and things going on.
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:48.051]  I mean, witch doctors 5,000 years ago would point at an eclipse or point at a wildfire or point at a snowstorm and say, you better bring better offerings to my tent or I'll make the ooga boogas get you.
[00:12:49.052 --> 00:12:50.534]  I mean, really, isn't this just a
[00:12:50.994 --> 00:12:59.128]  A organizing system to bring in global taxation and regulations this whole... I mean, what is your solution to the global warming?
[00:12:59.188 --> 00:13:03.415]  Is it not the global... Hold on, is it not the global carbon tax, as Al Gore's called for?
[00:13:04.433 --> 00:13:05.534]  There's many things.
[00:13:05.614 --> 00:13:11.459]  I think what you have to realize is that being environmentally sensitive and making money aren't mutually exclusive.
[00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:15.183]  There's a lot of money to be made in addressing this issue.
[00:13:15.443 --> 00:13:17.104]  There's been a lot of waste in our systems.
[00:13:17.144 --> 00:13:21.068]  We've built all our systems on a theory of infinite resources.
[00:13:21.368 --> 00:13:23.390]  We know for a fact we have finite resources.
[00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.451]  We know that we're consuming more than we're putting back.
[00:13:25.531 --> 00:13:29.595]  We know that our systems won't be able to support us if we continue to consume at this level.
[00:13:30.195 --> 00:13:36.160]  Um, you know, and you can say that, you know, things are cyclical, but, you know, and that we've seen these weather systems before.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:42.684]  But, you know, this is, the fact of the matter is, our CO2 levels today are higher than any other time in the last 650,000 years.
[00:13:43.085 --> 00:13:48.088]  Our civilization is being built around a system of stable weather systems and weather patterns.
[00:13:48.448 --> 00:13:58.356]  Our weather patterns are changing as fast as we... What caused Pompeii, or what caused, you know, famous hurricanes?
[00:13:59.525 --> 00:14:03.047]  Tom Davis is a natural disaster, which was, of course it was.
[00:14:03.427 --> 00:14:04.808]  What do you think caused it?
[00:14:04.988 --> 00:14:06.609]  But see, that's my point.
[00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:16.274]  Is it what caused the divine wind, the kamikaze that blew away the Chinese fleet that was coming into Japan?
[00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:19.255]  Let me ask you a question, sir.
[00:14:19.335 --> 00:14:20.356]  What is the downside?
[00:14:20.456 --> 00:14:22.897]  Why don't you want to believe climate change exists?
[00:14:23.883 --> 00:14:27.747]  Well, number one, I'd like to tell you, I'd like to tell you.
[00:14:28.868 --> 00:14:38.916]  Number one, I read Professor Carol Quigley, I read United Nations documents, I researched the Council on Foreign Relations, I researched the different think tanks and groups that your family funds, also the things that
[00:14:39.657 --> 00:14:41.878]  Prince Bernhardt was pushing before he died.
[00:14:41.938 --> 00:14:56.924]  Now of course Prince Philip, head of the Worldwide Fund, where they say they want to exterminate 80% of us, where they want to bring in neo-feudalism and serfdom as a model to manage the planet and that human beings are a scourge.
[00:14:56.964 --> 00:14:57.965]  And I know that Malthus
[00:14:58.705 --> 00:15:06.867]  Back in the 1790s, said, oh wonderful, we're going to outstrip our resources and half the population will starve to death by 1950.
[00:15:07.387 --> 00:15:27.272]  You know, this type of baloney, and it's always turned out to be a fraud, you try to organize society by claiming there's a crisis and that you're going to be the organizers, then you invite all the business people in saying, this is the new model, jump on the big bandwagon now, and you're not dealing with cross-species chimera genetic engineering, which can destroy your house.
[00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:31.796]  I know you don't care about the population, but you better care about your own house of Rothschild.
[00:15:32.077 --> 00:15:43.048]  And so what you do is you ignore all the real environmental crises, and then you bring in world government and world taxation so you guys can even rule us with an even greater hand, and I'm sick of it.
[00:15:43.248 --> 00:15:46.171]  I'm not your slave, Rothschild, and your scam's not going to work.
[00:15:47.046 --> 00:15:50.130]  Well, you know, sir, I've never seen someone get so defensive.
[00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:54.595]  It's obviously, you know what they say, when you're in the wrong, you get overheated, and I can see that with you now.
[00:15:54.656 --> 00:15:56.077]  No, you asked my question!
[00:15:56.197 --> 00:15:57.679]  Debate any of my facts!
[00:15:57.739 --> 00:15:59.201]  Debate any of my facts!
[00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:03.006]  If you carry on like that, sir, you're going to cause global warming yourself, the way you're heating over there.
[00:16:03.366 --> 00:16:04.187]  Hey, you know what?
[00:16:04.207 --> 00:16:04.987]  You're absolutely right.
[00:16:05.007 --> 00:16:05.487]  I'm angry.
[00:16:06.108 --> 00:16:13.832]  Yeah, the fact of the matter is, sir, you cannot deny that our species, our biodiversity loss is global.
[00:16:14.052 --> 00:16:16.933]  We're losing rainforests at 100,000 acres a day.
[00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:19.174]  Our weather patterns have changed.
[00:16:19.434 --> 00:16:21.475]  The scientific community is unanimous.
[00:16:21.575 --> 00:16:22.916]  I don't know whether you're sitting on that.
[00:16:22.956 --> 00:16:24.277]  Number one, they're not unanimous.
[00:16:25.146 --> 00:16:37.412]  Listen, maybe your shares in the oil industry that you have in your back pocket there are helping to drive your radio station, and that's why you're a bit concerned about maybe your little taxation... No, it came out... Wait a minute... Have you got children?
[00:16:37.472 --> 00:16:38.152]  Have you got children?
[00:16:38.172 --> 00:16:40.253]  Alright, just hold on a second, Lord Rothchild.
[00:16:40.293 --> 00:16:41.674]  Let me just say something here.
[00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:42.814]  Yes, I do.
[00:16:43.055 --> 00:16:43.795]  Yes, I do.
[00:16:43.855 --> 00:16:48.177]  I'm not a... What kind of planet do you think you're going to pass on to them?
[00:16:48.257 --> 00:16:53.183]  Well, let me answer your question, because you keep putting these questions out and I'm going to answer them right now.
[00:16:53.643 --> 00:16:57.828]  You bet I'm angry because I have... Let me finish, let me finish.
[00:16:57.988 --> 00:17:00.731]  You didn't answer... I'm going to answer the question.
[00:17:00.831 --> 00:17:08.300]  You didn't answer my question and you're using a lawyer tactic of asking a question and not letting me answer it, implying that I didn't answer it.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:19.959]  You didn't answer my questions about your family and others bankrolling modern eugenics under the guise of all these social Darwinism programs.
[00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:20.921]  Are you denying it?
[00:17:21.802 --> 00:17:22.784]  Of course I'm denying it.
[00:17:24.115 --> 00:17:25.836]  You're saying Prince Philip didn't?
[00:17:26.656 --> 00:17:28.177]  I've got nothing to do with Prince Philip.
[00:17:28.817 --> 00:17:31.278]  The fact of the matter is, this has got nothing to do with climate change, sir.
[00:17:31.378 --> 00:17:36.360]  I'm coming on here to say, I've been to these places, I've seen this stuff, I've spent over 200 days in the office.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.340]  Let me tell you something.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.841]  Have you ever been outside of Texas?
[00:17:39.121 --> 00:17:39.821]  Yes, I have been.
[00:17:40.381 --> 00:17:40.941]  Where have you been?
[00:17:41.882 --> 00:17:43.162]  I've been a lot of places.
[00:17:43.802 --> 00:17:47.544]  I don't have an education, I haven't traveled, I don't know anything.
[00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:49.451]  I'm not saying that at all.
[00:17:49.491 --> 00:17:50.151]  I'm just asking you.
[00:17:50.171 --> 00:17:51.132]  No, that's the implication.
[00:17:51.152 --> 00:17:54.075]  Yes, I've been up to the Arctic Circle.
[00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:55.076]  Let me finish.
[00:17:55.476 --> 00:17:57.678]  I've been across the Arctic Circle, but I've been up to it.
[00:17:57.998 --> 00:17:59.800]  Now, let me just ask you a question.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.423]  So, you're telling me that the Inuit communities... No, you asked me a question.
[00:18:03.443 --> 00:18:04.824]  Let me answer, Rothschild.
[00:18:04.844 --> 00:18:06.425]  Okay, you answer then, sir.
[00:18:08.422 --> 00:18:16.508]  Now, we all know last year that the media got caught, and National Geographic, the known propaganda channel got caught, showing images of polar bears saying, look at them, they're stranded on ice.
[00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:33.021]  Polar bears can swim 200 miles, you and I both know that, but you know the dumb public, that the globalists are always hoodwinking, doesn't know that, and you've got new IMAX programs and new Disney programs coming up, going, look at the drowning polar bears, they're all dying because the ice is melting.
[00:18:33.262 --> 00:18:37.425]  Everyone knows that the glaciers expand and contract, and are collapsing continually.
[00:18:39.642 --> 00:18:40.662]  Go ahead, there's your answer.
[00:18:40.702 --> 00:18:42.103]  What's your point?
[00:18:42.183 --> 00:18:44.304]  I think you still haven't even asked the question.
[00:18:44.324 --> 00:18:49.185]  My point is that you guys are setting up global taxation, as Al Gore has said.
[00:18:49.445 --> 00:18:50.966]  It has nothing to do with the environment.
[00:18:51.086 --> 00:18:54.187]  I am concerned about cross-species genetic engineering.
[00:18:54.427 --> 00:18:57.328]  I am concerned about destroying old growth forests.
[00:18:57.408 --> 00:18:59.489]  I am worried about those type of things.
[00:18:59.649 --> 00:19:06.971]  But you guys are gobbling up all the world's concern to just simply line your pockets and make kids read your book in schools and do all this.
[00:19:07.031 --> 00:19:09.152]  It's a business, just like you said, Rothschild.
[00:19:09.934 --> 00:19:10.679]  It's not a big deal.
[00:19:10.739 --> 00:19:12.108]  Do you think I make any money out of this?
[00:19:13.032 --> 00:19:18.833]  It's the same thing, it's the same thing your great-great-great-grand... your money-changing ancestors did.
[00:19:19.053 --> 00:19:22.374]  They're in Germany, Red Shield, and I'm calling you out, Red Shield.
[00:19:22.534 --> 00:19:23.615]  We know it's a scam!
[00:19:24.415 --> 00:19:30.896]  Okay, well listen, you know, the funny thing is, sir, if you think it's a scam, I think, you know, then what I want to know is where are you going to live when this planet collapses?
[00:19:30.996 --> 00:19:32.297]  Where are you going to be next or next year?
[00:19:32.377 --> 00:19:33.157]  Okay, okay, we got a break.
[00:19:33.197 --> 00:19:39.778]  I'm challenging you to hold over three minutes and to come back and I'll answer the question about where I'm going to live and what I think about my family.
[00:19:40.098 --> 00:19:40.879]  Or are you afraid?
[00:19:40.899 --> 00:19:42.539]  Are you going to hang up, Red Shield?
[00:19:44.416 --> 00:19:45.757]  You gonna stay with us adventurer?
[00:19:45.958 --> 00:19:47.859]  You gonna take this adventure challenge with me?
[00:19:51.542 --> 00:19:53.363]  We'll see if you're there on the other side.
[00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:54.864]  I'm Alex Jones!
[00:19:55.705 --> 00:19:57.266]  We got a red shield on the line!
[00:20:03.507 --> 00:20:07.990]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:08.351 --> 00:20:12.434]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.714 --> 00:20:13.274]  We listened.
[00:20:13.574 --> 00:20:18.558]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.838 --> 00:20:19.339]  We listened.
[00:20:19.719 --> 00:20:22.741]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:23.702]  We listened.
[00:20:24.162 --> 00:20:28.225]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:28.605 --> 00:20:29.086]  We listened.
[00:20:29.446 --> 00:20:34.670]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:36.451]  Again, we listened.
[00:20:36.811 --> 00:20:38.393]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:20:38.573 --> 00:20:44.137]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:44.597 --> 00:20:47.218]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[00:20:47.438 --> 00:20:47.618]  Only $279.
[00:20:47.658 --> 00:20:48.279]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.319 --> 00:20:48.559]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.619 --> 00:20:50.240]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:51.220]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:05.349]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:21:05.369 --> 00:21:06.630]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:10.374]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:10.675 --> 00:21:13.177]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:13.578 --> 00:21:15.339]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.962]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:19.003 --> 00:21:29.448]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:31.129 --> 00:21:33.430]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:36.571]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:39.253]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.

[00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:55.371]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:22:01.621 --> 00:22:03.682]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.302 --> 00:22:13.226]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:20.869]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.602 --> 00:22:27.108]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:27.588 --> 00:22:38.419]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.182]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:23:00.808 --> 00:23:02.529]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:23:02.689 --> 00:23:03.950]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:07.012]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:07.372 --> 00:23:10.134]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:10.674 --> 00:23:17.418]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:23:44.322 --> 00:23:44.982]  Call 877-873-9626.
[00:23:45.003 --> 00:23:45.263]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:23:45.323 --> 00:23:48.965]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:48.985 --> 00:23:50.106]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:12.453 --> 00:24:19.514]  Well, we've got the son of one of the most powerful Rothschilds in modern times, David Mayer de Rothschild.
[00:24:20.314 --> 00:24:29.216]  He is a British adventurer and environmentalist whose book is the official book of the Global Ad Campaign for Global Taxation and Regulatory Systems.
[00:24:30.516 --> 00:24:38.718]  And he, of course, your school children out there will probably be reading it under the, of course, they don't know how to read, that's all part of the larger plan, but there's lots of pictures for them.
[00:24:40.862 --> 00:24:43.043]  David Rothschild, you've got the floor.
[00:24:43.103 --> 00:24:44.423]  I've really been running over you.
[00:24:44.443 --> 00:24:45.023]  Go ahead.
[00:24:45.744 --> 00:24:46.364]  Well, that's okay.
[00:24:46.464 --> 00:24:52.326]  I think when you say that it's all about tax, I think you have to look at all the other things which we're talking about.
[00:24:53.506 --> 00:25:04.530]  The recycling industry and the fact that there's the opportunity now, it's a $50 billion industry, and there's an opportunity there to create jobs, there's an opportunity to be environmentally friendly, there's an opportunity
[00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:05.971]  We're good to go.
[00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:27.231]  Sure.
[00:25:27.251 --> 00:25:27.411]  Sure.
[00:25:45.911 --> 00:25:47.813]  Sure, actually I do.
[00:25:47.833 --> 00:25:49.315]  But let me be clear on this.
[00:25:50.476 --> 00:25:51.758]  I am for renewable energy.
[00:25:51.838 --> 00:25:52.919]  I am for new systems.
[00:25:53.079 --> 00:25:58.946]  It is the big oil companies that have stopped the 150 mile per gallon carburetor.
[00:25:59.736 --> 00:26:11.682]  We know that that's going on, and we know that even Greg Powless of the BBC broke the news with the documents that Dutch Rochelle, who's big and all... You're not denying, you're not denying the... Are you denying that climate change exists?
[00:26:11.702 --> 00:26:13.903]  But, but, but C, do you want me to say this?
[00:26:13.923 --> 00:26:17.725]  No, I'm just wondering... I'm trying to answer your question, I'm trying to answer your question.
[00:26:17.745 --> 00:26:19.466]  You're not answering me, I've asked this before.
[00:26:19.546 --> 00:26:22.267]  No, what I'm telling you is... No, no, no, answer my question first.
[00:26:22.287 --> 00:26:22.527]  Okay.
[00:26:22.587 --> 00:26:24.288]  Are you denying that climate change exists?
[00:26:25.038 --> 00:26:28.520]  The UN's own report says that about 6%... I'm asking you.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:29.340]  I'm not asking about the UN.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.302]  You want to keep it very simple because you think my audience is dumbed down?
[00:26:32.582 --> 00:26:32.942]  No, no.
[00:26:33.022 --> 00:26:34.623]  I'm not telling your audience is dumbed down.
[00:26:34.643 --> 00:26:37.264]  I'm saying... Man-made climate change is not happening.
[00:26:37.324 --> 00:26:40.246]  Man-made climate change is not happening.
[00:26:40.386 --> 00:26:44.928]  It is not a large contributor to the overall solar cycle.
[00:26:45.328 --> 00:26:56.838]  It is not a large contributor to the... You know, NASA says the sun's radiance is the brightest ever recorded, and that it is the sun energizing the space particuli in the atmosphere.
[00:26:56.858 --> 00:27:00.180]  It's called... Yeah, it's called Milankovitch's Cycle.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:02.863]  There's three different types of cycles, and yes, you're correct.
[00:27:02.883 --> 00:27:07.366]  There is an amount of our climatic systems that is dictated by the solar activity.
[00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:13.071]  How much solar energy is allowed onto the planet, and where the solar energy lands on our planet.
[00:27:13.371 --> 00:27:28.758]  But what's happening is, by pumping out greenhouse gases, nitrous oxides, methane, CO2, by our consumption, we are thickening the atmosphere around our planet, which is trapping not only that additional solar energy that you're talking about, but also we're trapping in further greenhouse gases and further heat.
[00:27:28.958 --> 00:27:30.519]  Well, let's talk about carbon dioxide.
[00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:31.500]  Let me just ask you a question.
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:37.142]  Carbon dioxide, Al Gore's now been debunked by major scientists, by Channel 4.
[00:27:37.422 --> 00:27:38.663]  Let me just finish.
[00:27:38.743 --> 00:27:39.903]  Let me just finish.
[00:27:41.284 --> 00:27:43.847]  Well, he says that CO2 goes up, then heat goes up.
[00:27:44.127 --> 00:27:49.574]  It's actually trailing between 200 and 600 years after carbon dioxide is what plants breathe.
[00:27:49.794 --> 00:27:53.398]  They then put out more oxygen and major ice core studies.
[00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:54.860]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.882]  Right now we have links to mainstream news.
[00:27:57.442 --> 00:28:14.048]  Major studies just came out showing that, they also indicate that during the last period between the ice ages, 116 to 130,000 years ago, when temperatures were an average of 5 Celsius to 9 Fahrenheit now, the glaciers on Greenland did not completely melt away, were poised reuters.
[00:28:15.209 --> 00:28:23.496]  But the point is, right, if a scientific community is coming out, we know that carbon dioxide is directly relatable to the temperature of the atmosphere on our planet.
[00:28:24.256 --> 00:28:25.417]  We know that for a fact.
[00:28:25.518 --> 00:28:26.338]  No, we don't.
[00:28:26.719 --> 00:28:28.080]  Of course we do.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:29.341]  That's why we live in this planet.
[00:28:29.381 --> 00:28:34.886]  Our planet is livable in because we have a certain amount of CO2, 285 parts per million, which is what it was.
[00:28:34.926 --> 00:28:37.468]  CO2 actually then leads to cooling.
[00:28:37.868 --> 00:28:45.292]  It was 285 parts per million, pre-industrial levels, and since the dawn of industrialization... It did in 1955!
[00:28:45.632 --> 00:28:46.552]  It's been dropping!
[00:28:46.832 --> 00:28:47.953]  It hasn't been dropping.
[00:28:47.993 --> 00:28:49.013]  You're in denial, sir.
[00:28:49.313 --> 00:28:49.934]  You really are.
[00:28:49.954 --> 00:28:52.155]  I think it's... I don't know where you're reading the facts.
[00:28:52.195 --> 00:28:55.036]  You just said all the scientists unanimously agree!
[00:28:55.276 --> 00:28:56.717]  That's the biggest hoax I ever heard!
[00:28:57.217 --> 00:28:59.780]  Do you find your facts on thisfactisajoke.com?
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:00.942]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:29:00.962 --> 00:29:02.684]  Where do you find your facts on?
[00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:03.925]  BP's website?
[00:29:03.945 --> 00:29:07.509]  No, we've had tons of... BP is behind the peak oil scam.
[00:29:07.990 --> 00:29:10.132]  BP is behind the peak oil scam!
[00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:11.634]  We have the documents!
[00:29:12.114 --> 00:29:14.616]  Listen, CO2 is at 385 parts per million.
[00:29:14.656 --> 00:29:16.497]  No scientist in the world will deny that.
[00:29:16.777 --> 00:29:26.584]  And if you find that, and you find a scientist who's denying that right now at 385 parts per million of CO2, then you email it to me, I'll have a look, and I'll come back on your show and I'll tell you what we did.
[00:29:26.624 --> 00:29:30.167]  No, we're not saying that CO2 levels aren't elevated.
[00:29:30.547 --> 00:29:33.089]  What we're saying is CO2 elevated levels are good,
[00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:35.310]  No, they're not good.
[00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:36.091]  They're not good.
[00:29:36.231 --> 00:29:40.874]  Who tells you that CO2... CO2 is one of the reasons why our planet has a stable climate.
[00:29:41.074 --> 00:29:44.536]  The reason why we start to increase... We've never had a stable climate!
[00:29:44.676 --> 00:29:45.577]  That's another hoax!
[00:29:45.897 --> 00:29:47.919]  Rothschild, Rothschild, we've got to break it now.
[00:29:47.939 --> 00:29:49.520]  If you want to check it out, you can.
[00:29:49.540 --> 00:29:50.180]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:52.642]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.082 --> 00:29:54.703]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.604 --> 00:29:58.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.784 --> 00:30:06.726]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegel of the Nutri-Medical Report here on Genesis After Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[00:30:06.746 --> 00:30:15.329]  To develop the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[00:30:15.429 --> 00:30:16.749]  Defense tabs block virus
[00:30:16.749 --> 00:30:17.229]  We're good to go.
[00:30:34.284 --> 00:30:39.505]  Defense wipes will kill all the pathogenic viruses and bacteria on contact and are safe for you and your loved ones.
[00:30:39.645 --> 00:30:47.166]  So get a first-line defense kit and protect yourself from daily pathogens and from civil defense from biological, chemical, and toxic weapons.

[00:30:56.388 --> 00:30:57.968]  Stay well and protect your loved ones today!
[00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:05.465]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[00:32:02.012 --> 00:32:04.553]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:05.194 --> 00:32:11.796]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:32:13.012 --> 00:32:15.313]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:32:16.113 --> 00:32:22.334]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:32:23.234 --> 00:32:31.356]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:32:32.356 --> 00:32:40.178]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:41.076 --> 00:32:42.617]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:42.637 --> 00:32:42.998]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:43.018 --> 00:32:43.278]  Call now.
[00:32:43.338 --> 00:32:47.521]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:33:08.488 --> 00:33:22.926]  Well, all the environmentalists I talk to and conservationists, when they see Disney and when they see the Discovery Channel and Wall Street and the NFL getting behind global warming, man-made global warming, they say something's wrong.
[00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:37.128]  And of course I should bring up to Mr. Rothschild that the polar ice caps of Mars are receding at several miles a year, much faster than ours, and that the moons of Saturn and Jupiter are melting.
[00:33:37.208 --> 00:33:41.090]  In fact, several of their moons were ice and are now liquid seas.
[00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:45.952]  Now, how are SUVs causing that, David Rothschild?
[00:33:46.472 --> 00:33:48.594]  That's because those planets are closer to the sun, my friend.
[00:33:49.976 --> 00:33:54.058]  No, Jupiter and Saturn are not closer to the Sun, neither is Mars.
[00:33:55.799 --> 00:34:03.522]  I think you'll find, right, that the very simple matter, and what I wanted to say, and this is my final point, and then I'll let you continue with your line that global warming doesn't exist.
[00:34:03.822 --> 00:34:07.544]  I find it very sad that we're still in a day and age where there is a certain mentality
[00:34:08.124 --> 00:34:08.725]  I don't know.
[00:34:28.041 --> 00:34:28.442]  We're good to go.
[00:34:42.858 --> 00:34:43.458]  In your pocket.
[00:34:43.678 --> 00:34:52.063]  That is the companies, the exons of this world, the companies that are going out there and needlessly polluting our water systems, our natural systems.
[00:34:52.343 --> 00:34:58.787]  I think it's sad, sir, that you can, you know, I appreciate and respect people's views on both sides of the argument.
[00:34:58.827 --> 00:35:00.147]  That's what a debate is about.
[00:35:00.227 --> 00:35:03.509]  And I appreciate your views in taking this debate to me.
[00:35:03.869 --> 00:35:08.392]  But I would also say that it's sad because what you're doing here is giving people a false sense of hope.
[00:35:08.852 --> 00:35:23.700]  Our planet is in a seriously bad way right now, and if we continue to put out this rhetoric which says this doesn't exist, which you are doing and you're promoting, then all it's going to do is delay the situation that is going to cause more problems for your children, for my children, and the future of this planet.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.201]  We've got a serious problem.
[00:35:25.481 --> 00:35:35.947]  You can deny it all you like, but as the storms and the weather systems around us, whether they're cyclical or not, start to increase, which they are, then we're going to find ourselves in a more precarious position as humanity moves forward into the future.
[00:35:36.347 --> 00:35:49.340]  I've only got one more question for you, David Mayor de Rothschild, and that is that you bring up the fact that I'm in denial and I'm giving people a false sense of hope.
[00:35:50.261 --> 00:36:00.551]  All the major, the European Space Agency, NASA, all of the major real scientific organizations show massive
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:28.782]  solar system warming and it's the engine, the sun, that is driving that and all the past studies and archaeological records show that life blooms and increases in a carbon dioxide oxygen rich, because the two are tied together, and that we've actually been oxygen and carbon dioxide poor and have really been in somewhat of a dead cycle compared to, that's why they find coal at the North Pole and the South Pole from all the life
[00:36:29.742 --> 00:36:45.733]  And that this is actually a prime driver, and we see areas of the world that were going through the desert process, the desertification, now greening unexpectedly, and that we should welcome climate change, and that it's not necessarily a bad thing.
[00:36:45.753 --> 00:36:47.774]  I mean, you're saying we need to have a stable climate.
[00:36:48.015 --> 00:36:50.816]  Sir, the planet's never had a stable climate.
[00:36:50.837 --> 00:36:51.477]  The planet hasn't.
[00:36:51.497 --> 00:36:54.279]  For the last 12,000 years, we've been very
[00:36:55.223 --> 00:36:58.686]  Very stable, comparatively, for the four and a half billion years the planet's been around.
[00:36:59.347 --> 00:37:02.850]  A period of climatic systems, our systems are being incredibly stable.
[00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:06.252]  And I agree with you, we need carbon as a driver of life, I'm not denying that.
[00:37:06.693 --> 00:37:12.758]  You know, we have huge pockets of reserves of carbon, which for millions of years have taken millions of years,
[00:37:13.278 --> 00:37:15.639]  Um, just stored under our Earth's crust.
[00:37:16.059 --> 00:37:18.140]  We are releasing that, and we're putting it up.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:19.780]  And let's not confuse two things here.
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.922]  Let's not confuse biological carbon and carbon that's emitted through the burning of fossil fuels.
[00:37:24.282 --> 00:37:27.323]  One is inert and stays in the atmosphere, and one goes through the natural cycle.
[00:37:27.623 --> 00:37:34.886]  So we're confusing two things when we're pumping out, not only pumping out excess carbon, more than the natural system, but we're slashing burn agriculture.
[00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.827]  We're cutting down our carbon sinks to balance that.
[00:37:38.127 --> 00:37:39.967]  Our oceans are incredibly precarious.
[00:37:40.067 --> 00:37:40.708]  They absorb 40%
[00:37:42.228 --> 00:37:43.929]  of our world's atmosphere.
[00:37:43.949 --> 00:37:44.889]  Oh, I agree with that.
[00:37:45.049 --> 00:37:56.473]  I agree that... And as our temperatures get warmer, let me kind of go... Let me just say this, see, but see, you're tying together plankton blooms and different differentials in with carbon dioxide itself.
[00:37:56.533 --> 00:37:59.394]  And is it the different... and it's not just one tax.
[00:37:59.654 --> 00:38:08.417]  I mean, they're now tying the different environmental movements that, oh, we need a tax on more than one child, which really is a one-child policy.
[00:38:08.597 --> 00:38:10.818]  So we already see this whole move to restrict carbon.
[00:38:11.118 --> 00:38:13.360]  Really, a tax on life, a tax on breathing?
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.382]  I don't think it's a tax on life and a tax on breathing.
[00:38:16.402 --> 00:38:18.783]  I think the fact of the matter is, we have one planet.
[00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:19.984]  We don't have a spare one.
[00:38:20.504 --> 00:38:29.851]  We know that our systems and, you know, whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call it a cyclical change, whether you want to call it global warming, you know, everyone has their own opinion.
[00:38:30.371 --> 00:38:34.472]  And I think the fact of the matter is, for me personally, the time for debate is over.
[00:38:34.492 --> 00:38:38.394]  This is no longer about does it exist, does it not exist, who's doing what, who's not.
[00:38:38.954 --> 00:38:49.738]  As we keep on talking, the planet, the very thing that supports us... So we need to just stop thinking and just agree it's happening, and go do whatever Al Gore says, and just world government will save us.
[00:38:49.758 --> 00:38:53.539]  Well, okay, in a perfect world, what should we do, Rothschild?
[00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:56.542]  In the perfect world... What should we do to save ourselves?
[00:38:56.562 --> 00:38:57.703]  Tell me, save me!
[00:38:57.883 --> 00:38:58.123]  Save me!
[00:38:58.143 --> 00:38:59.605]  I'll tell you what, I'm saving you.
[00:38:59.705 --> 00:39:07.032]  In the perfect world, sir, you start to use common sense, which is obviously something that, you know, from some of your comments, I'm afraid I don't see.
[00:39:07.212 --> 00:39:07.672]  Save me.
[00:39:07.872 --> 00:39:08.453]  Oh, God.
[00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:10.055]  Do you save me, young ladies?
[00:39:10.415 --> 00:39:11.896]  Oh, Lord Rothschild, save me!
[00:39:12.057 --> 00:39:15.400]  You're such a dashing adventurer, like Indiana Jones!
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:16.861]  Oh, Lord Rothschild!
[00:39:17.181 --> 00:39:18.503]  Take me, Lord Rothschild!
[00:39:18.903 --> 00:39:22.507]  You sound like, you sound like... Listen, Mr. Oil Baron sitting in the center.
[00:39:22.747 --> 00:39:26.511]  If you want to start making funny noises like that on the phone, that's fair enough, oil boy.
[00:39:26.791 --> 00:39:36.301]  So get back onto your little rodeo bull, go out there and deny it all, protect your oil shares, and make sure that your kids, who you talked about, don't have any planet to live on.
[00:39:36.562 --> 00:39:38.063]  But anyway, I have to go, my friends.
[00:39:38.264 --> 00:39:39.245]  I appreciate your time.
[00:39:39.325 --> 00:39:40.306]  I just want to tell you something.
[00:39:40.946 --> 00:39:55.442]  Your family has caused a lot of pain in this world from what they pulled with Napoleon to all of it, and we're tired of it, and I'm not going to judge you by your family, but look at what you're doing out here pushing this whole global tax hysteria, this global tax
[00:39:55.902 --> 00:40:00.264]  I'm pushing common sense.
[00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:01.544]  I'm pushing education.
[00:40:01.564 --> 00:40:03.685]  I don't push one side of the argument or the other.
[00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:06.566]  All I'm doing is providing information for people to make an informed decision.
[00:40:06.586 --> 00:40:13.769]  Well, you're providing bad information and slogans and logos and it's not going to work at the end of the day.
[00:40:13.809 --> 00:40:21.792]  So I just want you to know, when you're at family reunions, let them know that America and the people, free humanity, will prevail.
[00:40:22.092 --> 00:40:23.953]  And if you send me your email address, we'll invite you along.
[00:40:24.273 --> 00:40:25.053]  You can come and join us.
[00:40:25.353 --> 00:40:25.973]  Yeah, I bet.
[00:40:26.153 --> 00:40:27.954]  We'd love to have you.
[00:40:29.214 --> 00:40:32.655]  Now, are those the estates that you guys took over in the French Revolution you engineered?
[00:40:33.055 --> 00:40:34.316]  Or are those the estates in England?
[00:40:35.276 --> 00:40:38.737]  Those are the hidden ones that we hide under the ground that no one knows about.
[00:40:39.277 --> 00:40:40.117]  Come on, man.
[00:40:40.237 --> 00:40:42.558]  You mean the one I snuck into in Northern California?
[00:40:42.898 --> 00:40:46.359]  Yeah, the one that you've been... You spend too long on the internet looking for conspiracy theories.
[00:40:46.439 --> 00:40:47.400]  I'd say, you know what I'd say?
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.261]  You sound like someone who needs to get out of the studio, reconnect with the rest of the world.
[00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:51.461]  Oh, yes.
[00:40:51.561 --> 00:40:52.081]  I've never left Texas.
[00:40:52.601 --> 00:40:55.003]  And go outside, and go outside and reconnect with nature.
[00:40:55.023 --> 00:40:55.784]  See what you're missing out on.
[00:40:55.804 --> 00:40:56.925]  Well, Rob Child, let me just say this.
[00:40:56.965 --> 00:41:03.089]  You know, you also make these hayseed, you know, comments about how we're a bunch of bumpkins and out here on our bulls in Texas.
[00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:05.291]  I never said, I never said, I never said anything about that.
[00:41:05.311 --> 00:41:06.052]  I live on a farm myself.
[00:41:06.072 --> 00:41:07.273]  The implication was clear.
[00:41:07.313 --> 00:41:08.534]  I'm talking about leadership.
[00:41:08.614 --> 00:41:09.895]  An elitist, an elitist implication.
[00:41:09.915 --> 00:41:10.395]  Sorry, that's my word.
[00:41:10.415 --> 00:41:11.116]  Sorry, that's my word.
[00:41:11.316 --> 00:41:12.457]  There's no elitist implication.
[00:41:12.477 --> 00:41:13.958]  I spend a lot, I'm a farmer.
[00:41:14.058 --> 00:41:14.739]  I live off the land.
[00:41:14.799 --> 00:41:15.439]  I farm my own.
[00:41:15.479 --> 00:41:16.180]  I have my own cattle.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:16.620]  I have my own farm.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.501]  You are a farmer.
[00:41:17.521 --> 00:41:18.121]  I'm doing my time.
[00:41:18.161 --> 00:41:20.243]  And we are slaves on your plantation.
[00:41:21.363 --> 00:41:22.024]  Well, you know what?
[00:41:22.044 --> 00:41:24.124]  I work for myself and I don't have anyone who works for me.
[00:41:24.164 --> 00:41:26.345]  So, at that point, sir, I would say again... Oh, really?
[00:41:26.385 --> 00:41:28.286]  What is your wealth?
[00:41:28.406 --> 00:41:29.746]  You always talk about oil shares.
[00:41:29.947 --> 00:41:36.069]  Your family in England, it turned out, Financial Times of London, owned Gazprom when they arrested one of the oligarchs.
[00:41:36.129 --> 00:41:37.669]  It turned out he was just a front.
[00:41:37.949 --> 00:41:42.911]  You guys are worth, in the aggregate, trillions of dollars, tens of trillions leveraged.
[00:41:43.071 --> 00:41:50.074]  And you sit here and you just, because I live in Texas, say that I'm from the movie Dallas and I'm sitting on top of an oil patch.
[00:41:50.114 --> 00:41:52.797]  These are all your insecurities that you're putting across here, sir.
[00:41:52.837 --> 00:41:53.938]  I've never said anything before.
[00:41:53.958 --> 00:41:57.462]  You've said repeatedly that I'm defending my oil stocks.
[00:41:57.923 --> 00:41:59.284]  Well, I guess you probably are.
[00:41:59.304 --> 00:41:59.925]  I don't know.
[00:41:59.965 --> 00:42:04.230]  Your family bankrolled the Rockefellers and Carnegie.
[00:42:05.211 --> 00:42:16.859]  You guys own the Bank of England, and you issue the world fiat currency, and you're the guys that have got the third world nations on billion dollar loans, owing 40 billion in loan sharking numbers.
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.501]  So don't try it Rothschild!
[00:42:18.921 --> 00:42:24.485]  I mean, again, again, you've obviously, you know, like your climate facts, you're getting yourself into a confused situation, my friend.
[00:42:24.645 --> 00:42:25.626]  Yeah, I'm not confused.
[00:42:25.646 --> 00:42:27.968]  These are published facts, Rothschild.
[00:42:28.028 --> 00:42:30.330]  Well, like I said, email them to me.
[00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:31.732]  Let me have a look at your published facts.
[00:42:31.752 --> 00:42:32.732]  Are you denying that N.M.
[00:42:32.793 --> 00:42:38.798]  Rothschild is not involved in the OECD and the Bank of International Settlements and the IMF and the World Bank?
[00:42:38.818 --> 00:42:43.022]  Because we've had Joseph Stiklitz, Chief Economist, World Bank, Nobel Prize winner here on air to talk about it.
[00:42:43.662 --> 00:42:45.184]  Yeah, well, I'll listen in to the show.
[00:42:45.264 --> 00:42:46.245]  I'll come off the phone, sir.
[00:42:47.501 --> 00:42:55.387]  Alright, well, listen, I want to challenge you to visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com so you can see the front line of the resistance.
[00:42:55.467 --> 00:42:57.068]  We will defeat eugenics.
[00:42:57.368 --> 00:42:59.609]  We will defeat the world feudal state.
[00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:01.191]  We will prevail.
[00:43:01.371 --> 00:43:02.171]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:43:02.331 --> 00:43:05.854]  Do you believe in the whole social Darwinistic eugenics movement?
[00:43:05.894 --> 00:43:13.059]  Because that's where the modern environmental movement came from, and that's where Prince Philip and Prince Charles and all of this scum get their ideas.
[00:43:13.599 --> 00:43:16.702]  Listen, I'm here to talk about my book, The Global Warming Survival Handbook.
[00:43:16.762 --> 00:43:17.743]  I'm sure you're going to buy one.
[00:43:17.823 --> 00:43:19.845]  I'm here to talk about the concerts that happened this weekend.
[00:43:19.865 --> 00:43:21.066]  I'm here to talk about climate change.
[00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:23.949]  Are you guys pushing to make kids read it?
[00:43:24.129 --> 00:43:24.549]  That's all.
[00:43:24.569 --> 00:43:26.671]  Are you guys pushing to make kids read it in schools?
[00:43:26.791 --> 00:43:28.593]  It's not for kids and it's not in schools.
[00:43:28.613 --> 00:43:30.174]  It's a book for anyone who wants to pick it up.
[00:43:30.415 --> 00:43:31.716]  Any other information but that one.
[00:43:31.736 --> 00:43:32.396]  But I'm looking at it.
[00:43:32.416 --> 00:43:35.079]  I mean, I've got quotes from you saying here that this is for the children.
[00:43:35.779 --> 00:43:38.220]  No, again, you're getting your facts wrong.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.461]  This book isn't for the children.
[00:43:39.501 --> 00:43:42.842]  This book is the official book that goes to the Live Earth Concert Series.
[00:43:43.242 --> 00:43:45.063]  It goes around the globe seven times a year.
[00:43:45.083 --> 00:43:47.784]  Let me figure it out, because I have a copy of the book here.
[00:43:47.804 --> 00:43:50.265]  You wrote another book then about children.
[00:43:50.645 --> 00:43:51.626]  How many books have you written?
[00:43:52.346 --> 00:43:53.587]  I've written more than you probably.
[00:43:54.727 --> 00:43:56.948]  Well, I've only written one and writing another right now.
[00:43:58.049 --> 00:44:01.910]  But what I'm trying to understand is, have you written a children's book?
[00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:02.731]  Yes, I have.
[00:44:03.351 --> 00:44:03.431]  Ah!
[00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.052]  It's got nothing to do with the environment.
[00:44:06.072 --> 00:44:07.893]  It's actually to do with health and how our body works.
[00:44:07.953 --> 00:44:08.874]  I'm a trained doctor.
[00:44:09.314 --> 00:44:10.075]  I'm a naturopath.
[00:44:10.095 --> 00:44:11.636]  And it was to do with how your body works.
[00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:13.217]  It's got nothing to do with the environment.
[00:44:13.597 --> 00:44:17.540]  So, again, I think you're getting... Well, you know, the book I got looks like it was... Hey, forgive me!
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:19.222]  It looks like it was written for children.
[00:44:19.302 --> 00:44:26.347]  I have news articles here where you're saying that you're trying to wake up the children of the threat of global warming and climate change.
[00:44:26.547 --> 00:44:28.649]  Are you saying that that's not a statement you made?
[00:44:28.669 --> 00:44:30.110]  Because I've got all the newspaper articles...
[00:44:30.730 --> 00:44:37.255]  It's the statement that I've made, that the book that you have in front of you, the book that I was asked to phone in on the show for, is not a children's book.
[00:44:37.295 --> 00:44:38.596]  It's a book that anyone can read.
[00:44:38.616 --> 00:44:40.238]  Looks like it was written for children.
[00:44:40.638 --> 00:44:42.800]  I guess you're targeting the child-like minds.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:47.804]  Well, I'm just targeting people who want to be interested and involved in an arm's-length of information.
[00:44:48.144 --> 00:44:49.705]  Like I said before, thank you for having me on the show.
[00:44:49.725 --> 00:44:51.146]  This is meant to be a ten-minute talk.
[00:44:51.166 --> 00:44:52.167]  I appreciate your debate.
[00:44:52.187 --> 00:44:53.908]  I appreciate you taking the time to listen to me.
[00:44:54.289 --> 00:44:55.790]  And I hope you have a very good day.
[00:44:56.070 --> 00:45:07.957]  Lord Rothschild, you know that your house will fail in the end, and you know that, and I want to let you know, that anyone who supports the New World Order and dehumanization is going to be, is going to go to prison.
[00:45:07.977 --> 00:45:08.718]  You just need to know that.
[00:45:08.758 --> 00:45:08.958]  Sure.
[00:45:09.298 --> 00:45:10.279]  Okay, thank you very much.
[00:45:10.299 --> 00:45:10.699]  Take care, buddy.
[00:45:10.739 --> 00:45:11.960]  Will you come visit me and bring me some food?
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:12.640]  Thanks, buddy.
[00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:13.941]  Bring you some food?
[00:45:17.603 --> 00:45:19.124]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:19.724 --> 00:45:21.285]  Bring me some food.
[00:45:21.305 --> 00:45:23.867]  Alright.
[00:45:25.746 --> 00:45:29.028]  Well, we had his lordship on for you.
[00:45:30.429 --> 00:45:36.594]  I mean, can you imagine having a bio out on yourself where you call yourself an adventurer?
[00:45:38.955 --> 00:45:39.696]  An adventurer.
[00:45:39.736 --> 00:45:44.359]  He goes around playing the part of the hero saving the world.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:53.025]  And he sits there and he makes statement after statement after statement after statement legions
[00:45:53.989 --> 00:45:55.491]  of false statements.
[00:45:56.572 --> 00:46:03.138]  Did you hear him say that Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun?
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.742]  By the way, that guy's smart.
[00:46:07.182 --> 00:46:08.063]  He was a good debater.
[00:46:08.664 --> 00:46:10.746]  He knows they're not closer to the Sun.
[00:46:10.786 --> 00:46:13.468]  He giggled after he said it.
[00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:16.111]  Did you notice he kept it real simple?
[00:46:16.131 --> 00:46:17.172]  See, I refuse to do that.
[00:46:17.944 --> 00:46:24.187]  People always tell me, people, CEOs I know and successful businessmen and women, they go, Alex, you've got to dumb it down, simplify it.
[00:46:24.347 --> 00:46:25.448]  I refuse to.
[00:46:26.008 --> 00:46:27.949]  I refuse to treat you like you're stupid.
[00:46:28.310 --> 00:46:29.770]  I don't even see myself as that smart.
[00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.071]  You can figure this out, folks.
[00:46:31.591 --> 00:46:33.592]  But did you see how he dumbed it all down?
[00:46:33.953 --> 00:46:36.494]  And this book I've got here isn't for children.
[00:46:36.714 --> 00:46:37.194]  You fooled me.
[00:46:37.234 --> 00:46:38.595]  It's written like it's for a third grader.
[00:46:40.737 --> 00:46:42.658]  But now, I mean, you saw the game there.
[00:46:43.058 --> 00:46:48.439]  He talked to everybody like they were children, and he kept saying that I was some oil baron, which of course I'm not.
[00:46:49.639 --> 00:46:57.102]  And then when I bring up the fact that his family is literally the preeminent family over world petroleum reserves, he would just say it was a conspiracy theory.
[00:46:58.062 --> 00:46:59.462]  And he dumbed it all down.
[00:46:59.842 --> 00:47:05.864]  He knows full well that it's mercury, this is out from the sun, standard yellow dwarf,
[00:47:09.133 --> 00:47:22.538]  And now scientific studies have shown that we're actually a fragment of another galaxy colliding in and being sucked in to the Coriolis energies of the Milky Way spiral-armed galaxy.
[00:47:22.638 --> 00:47:24.179]  Alright, I'm already getting off into where we're at.
[00:47:24.619 --> 00:47:29.021]  The point here is that we are a standard yellow dwarf solar system.
[00:47:30.228 --> 00:47:38.414]  With 8 registered bodies of planetoid size, with more than 50 other planetoids that have now been downgraded.
[00:47:38.474 --> 00:47:40.675]  As you know, Pluto downgraded to not be a planet.
[00:47:40.975 --> 00:47:42.736]  But I don't go with the official statements.
[00:47:43.397 --> 00:47:52.403]  I'm going to go with precedent and say we have 9 planets, and the planets going out from the sun are... This is for Lord Rothschild.
[00:47:52.683 --> 00:47:56.806]  Now, he knows this, but he said on air it wasn't, thinking you're stupid.
[00:47:57.572 --> 00:47:57.892]  Okay?
[00:47:57.912 --> 00:47:59.854]  This is how they run game on you.
[00:47:59.874 --> 00:48:01.655]  This is how they treat you and laugh at you.
[00:48:02.976 --> 00:48:07.679]  Mercury doesn't spin one side molten, one side not.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:10.842]  Then Venus, then Earth, then Mars, and out.
[00:48:13.023 --> 00:48:14.925]  Jupiter and Saturn are out past.
[00:48:14.965 --> 00:48:18.927]  Then, of course, you've got Neptune and Uranus and Pluto and on out into the Kuiper Belt.
[00:48:20.348 --> 00:48:25.492]  And I just get really sick of these people treating you like you're complete buffoons.
[00:48:25.892 --> 00:48:26.413]  But they know!
[00:48:28.138 --> 00:48:38.341]  It's now turned out that two chairmen of committees in the House and Senate, both of them have been asked, one of them months after the big controversy where the head of the House Armed Services didn't know.
[00:48:40.202 --> 00:48:43.503]  What is the difference between a Shiite and a Sunni in Iraq?
[00:48:44.295 --> 00:48:45.395]  They don't know!
[00:48:46.035 --> 00:48:46.755]  They don't know!
[00:48:46.996 --> 00:48:54.417]  They've had major studies every year that they do, going back into the 80s, asking people how many continents there are, to name 10 state capitals.
[00:48:54.457 --> 00:48:55.097]  They can't do it.
[00:48:55.497 --> 00:49:00.878]  Over 80% of high school seniors a few years ago, I haven't seen the numbers lately, didn't know who the vice president was.
[00:49:01.198 --> 00:49:03.599]  Okay, Rothschild knows that!
[00:49:03.959 --> 00:49:04.399]  Alright?
[00:49:05.399 --> 00:49:06.479]  And this is the point I make.
[00:49:06.839 --> 00:49:10.660]  People are so disconnected from reality now, that up in
[00:49:12.159 --> 00:49:16.343]  Kansas a few days ago, a woman was stabbed to death, bleeding to death.
[00:49:16.383 --> 00:49:19.146]  She did die in the middle of the aisle by the front door.
[00:49:20.067 --> 00:49:28.374]  And at least, this is what the police set up, at least five people stepped over her or went past her while she was bleeding to death begging for help in a pool of blood.
[00:49:29.616 --> 00:49:31.177]  One woman stopped and took a picture.
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.403]  You know, what does that have to do with Rothschild talking to us like we're five years old?
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:38.700]  They know!
[00:49:38.761 --> 00:49:50.470]  You're totally disconnected, dreaming about satiating some animal lust, thinking how to act more powerful like a posing peacock with your neighbors, instead of the bigger world around you.
[00:49:52.852 --> 00:50:07.283]  I mean, if you don't care about somebody bleeding to death, or a cop run over in the street, then you don't care about yourself, and your neighbors don't care about you, and then you don't care about information, so you are going to be totally enslaved, and you're going to have people treat you like fools, and scam you.
[00:50:09.255 --> 00:50:13.256]  And that's why they'll say there's no North American Union when they're officially putting it into place right now.
[00:50:13.536 --> 00:50:15.596]  That's why they'll say Amnesty is an Amnesty when it is.
[00:50:16.196 --> 00:50:21.017]  That's why they'll talk to us like we are people with 65 IQs.
[00:50:21.297 --> 00:50:22.237]  Well, you know what?
[00:50:22.277 --> 00:50:23.978]  The people don't have 65 IQs.
[00:50:23.998 --> 00:50:25.398]  They got 100 IQs on average.
[00:50:26.418 --> 00:50:27.618]  And they're not stupid.
[00:50:27.658 --> 00:50:35.500]  They're just mesmerized and in a trance and focused in on... I mean, you know all about Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt and all this stuff that doesn't matter.
[00:50:36.576 --> 00:50:37.677]  Let me tell you something.
[00:50:38.058 --> 00:50:44.484]  If you don't want to be totally dominated by people like that Rothschild scum, you better wake up right now.
[00:50:46.626 --> 00:50:49.889]  Now it was only nice of that scum to keep him on the line.
[00:50:50.970 --> 00:50:52.311]  This is what I really think of him.
[00:50:53.312 --> 00:50:58.838]  From the depths of my soul I pledge eternal warfare against you and all your evil.
[00:51:04.762 --> 00:51:07.965]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.305 --> 00:51:10.247]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.607 --> 00:51:18.234]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.928 --> 00:51:25.993]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.394 --> 00:51:37.802]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.122 --> 00:51:41.765]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.105 --> 00:51:44.047]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.367 --> 00:51:48.210]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.701 --> 00:52:04.882]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.922 --> 00:52:08.964]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:09.084 --> 00:52:11.645]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.705 --> 00:52:14.046]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.226 --> 00:52:22.669]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.729 --> 00:52:24.049]  The brookie light is different.
[00:52:24.189 --> 00:52:28.251]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.291 --> 00:52:28.932]  We're good to go!

[00:53:01.423 --> 00:53:03.124]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.364 --> 00:53:07.046]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:07.386 --> 00:53:09.587]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[00:53:16.471 --> 00:53:21.374]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.574 --> 00:53:30.539]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:04.295 --> 00:54:10.319]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.919 --> 00:54:13.881]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:29.352 --> 00:54:30.873]  Alright folks, we're back live.
[00:54:30.913 --> 00:54:50.688]  We've got a CIA agent, former CIA agent joining us, who on Monday, remember right after the bombings of last week, went on air and made the point that the bomb was not professional, was a joke, was a... was being completely hyped out of control.
[00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:57.894]  You know, it's just to have these arrogant people who've learned how to lie to the population and learned how to
[00:54:59.265 --> 00:55:00.385]  Snivel and giggle.
[00:55:01.906 --> 00:55:04.286]  Just continually get away with it makes me sick.
[00:55:05.447 --> 00:55:25.993]  And as I said about this Rothschild enemy that we had on earlier, just to read his bio, the sniveling comments that are in it about how he's this incredible adventurer and he's actually saving the earth.
[00:55:26.013 --> 00:55:27.593]  I mean it actually
[00:55:28.581 --> 00:55:44.971]  He says that, and then he tried to say that Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun than the Earth, and he tried to say that there's no plan for a global tax, it's not a tax, it's quote, a fee on the evil polluters.
[00:55:45.931 --> 00:55:46.652]  And I go, oh really?
[00:55:47.092 --> 00:55:57.158]  Greg Pallast, BBC, broke the fact that over ten years ago, what is it, eleven years ago now, that British Petroleum created the peak oil term as a pretext to claim there weren't
[00:55:58.032 --> 00:56:02.274]  New reserves being found, when in truth, there is a glut of oil, there's too much of it.
[00:56:02.554 --> 00:56:05.015]  Remember 1990, Saddam Hussein was being criticized?
[00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:08.636]  If you don't, don't just believe me, I demand you go to the library!
[00:56:09.396 --> 00:56:19.220]  I demand you go to early 1990, and type in, in the computer when they're searching the microfilm, Saddam Hussein over-pumping of oil.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:22.061]  Or Saddam Hussein OPEC complaint.
[00:56:23.286 --> 00:56:23.967]  I've done this.
[00:56:24.847 --> 00:56:27.169]  I remember seeing it in 1990.
[00:56:27.269 --> 00:56:28.850]  I have a pretty good memory, but I didn't trust it.
[00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:33.673]  A few years ago, I was at the library, and I said, you know, I don't want to just make that claim while I was doing some other research.
[00:56:34.193 --> 00:56:37.695]  And I went and I searched it, and literally hundreds of hits came up.
[00:56:37.755 --> 00:56:40.737]  I only looked up one, saw it, read what I remembered.
[00:56:41.458 --> 00:56:44.400]  But again, I spot-checked my memory, because it's wrong sometimes.
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:46.861]  Okay, too much oil!
[00:56:47.121 --> 00:56:51.945]  And he said, well, I'm trying to pay off a $35 billion debt to the U.S., a weapons debt.
[00:56:51.965 --> 00:56:52.585]  And they said, nope.
[00:56:53.306 --> 00:56:55.588]  Stop over-pumping or driving down prices.
[00:56:55.828 --> 00:56:59.431]  It was like 90 cents, 91 cents on average.
[00:57:00.292 --> 00:57:01.613]  Those were the good old days, weren't they?
[00:57:01.633 --> 00:57:02.814]  Thanks to Saddam Hussein.
[00:57:03.714 --> 00:57:04.575]  Over-pumping.
[00:57:05.196 --> 00:57:06.357]  Driving down the price.
[00:57:06.977 --> 00:57:08.839]  Now they've gone into Iraq and turned the oil off.
[00:57:09.299 --> 00:57:12.942]  And the neocons get on air and say, well there's less oil coming out right now.
[00:57:13.162 --> 00:57:16.004]  Thought Bush wanted oil.
[00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:17.906]  Talking to you like you're five-year-olds.
[00:57:19.139 --> 00:57:20.241]  Play them little tricks on you.
[00:57:20.762 --> 00:57:24.747]  Just like they said, the people are getting mad at Halliburton and have no bid contracts.
[00:57:25.048 --> 00:57:27.231]  I don't want them Frenchies getting the contracts.
[00:57:27.772 --> 00:57:31.117]  No foreigners were allowed to have contracts except for Britain and Spain.
[00:57:32.483 --> 00:57:36.724]  And Poland, who were in the coalition, but they weren't even allowed in the no-bid contracts.
[00:57:36.744 --> 00:57:38.545]  That means no bids, period.
[00:57:39.065 --> 00:57:40.865]  The French weren't ever allowed to bid on anything.
[00:57:41.365 --> 00:57:47.827]  But see, instead of talking about no-bid contracts for American corporations either, they said, well, who wants the French to be able to bid?
[00:57:48.127 --> 00:57:49.407]  The French weren't involved!
[00:57:49.587 --> 00:57:50.587]  They mess with you!
[00:57:50.627 --> 00:57:51.808]  They play games with you!
[00:57:51.988 --> 00:57:54.028]  They treat you like children!
[00:57:54.909 --> 00:57:56.649]  And you bet I'm mad, Rothschild!
[00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:59.091]  You talk about my family.
[00:57:59.131 --> 00:58:00.372]  Aren't I worried about my family?
[00:58:00.972 --> 00:58:03.575]  You bet I'm worried about my family, Rothschild.
[00:58:05.036 --> 00:58:06.257]  You bet I'm worried about them.
[00:58:07.037 --> 00:58:11.801]  Because I know about the eugenics plans, and I know the things you're planning, and I know the things you've done.
[00:58:11.821 --> 00:58:14.383]  Aaron Dykes.
[00:58:14.824 --> 00:58:20.688]  I meant to have him on all week, and we have so many great guests today that we only have time for him for one hour.
[00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.070]  And it's going to be a split interview.
[00:58:23.771 --> 00:58:25.432]  We've got the CIA fella coming up.
[00:58:25.452 --> 00:58:26.353]  Let's get him five after.
[00:58:26.373 --> 00:58:27.354]  I've got to get my notes together.
[00:58:28.640 --> 00:58:35.583]  And then we've got a lady who was in Nazi Germany as a child, and she's written about the frightening parallels she sees.
[00:58:36.003 --> 00:58:40.165]  But from 12.30 to 1, we're going to have Erin, and from 1.30 to the end of the show, we're going to have Erin.

[00:58:57.953 --> 00:58:58.594]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.255 --> 00:59:00.316]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:02.179]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.799 --> 00:59:03.601]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:05.263]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.923 --> 00:59:09.628]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.129 --> 00:59:14.194]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.736 --> 00:59:23.883]  All right, we've got former CIA agent Larry Johnson coming on.
[00:59:23.943 --> 00:59:28.127]  Headline, ex-CIA man exposes hysteria of car bomb terror.
[00:59:28.627 --> 00:59:32.351]  Here's that clip from the news and we'll have him on after the break.
[00:59:32.751 --> 00:59:33.232]  Here it is.
[00:59:33.942 --> 01:00:02.198]  Bush administration's twin mantras for war in Iraq that we need to go outside the Constitution to interrupt terrorism and that we need to fight terrorists there so they do not follow us here turned on their twin heads early this morning by a chance discovery in London not by an interrogation unit but by an ambulance crew attending to an injured man near Piccadilly Circus noticing what appeared to be smoke coming from a Mercedes parked outside a nightclub what we now know to have been an explosive or combustible device that had failed to detonate
[01:00:02.658 --> 01:00:03.719]  Our fourth story on the Countdown.
[01:00:03.739 --> 01:00:07.080]  The details of the plot, whatever they were, still emerging at this hour.
[01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:11.923]  A second car inspected by authorities because it had been illegally parked, so they towed it.
[01:00:12.383 --> 01:00:15.285]  Both vehicles said to have contained inflammable materials.
[01:00:15.645 --> 01:00:24.830]  What we know in just the first car to have been several propane gas canisters described as patio gas canisters, nails, and around 50 gallons of gasoline.
[01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:30.813]  Officials saying that the cell phone that was part of the first car bomb, if it was a bomb, had received two incoming
[01:00:30.953 --> 01:00:31.413]  We're good to go.
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:57.660]  Good evening, Keith.
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:58.981]  The mechanics of this.
[01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:02.022]  You've got dozens of surveillance cameras blanketing this area.
[01:01:02.322 --> 01:01:05.223]  Might be the most photographed area in the world as cars are parked.
[01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:13.227]  There's 50 gallons of gas in the first car, camper-sized canisters of propane, meaning they're used by campers, and some nils.
[01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:15.968]  What happens if you actually manage to spark this device?
[01:01:16.488 --> 01:01:23.751]  It's going to do a lot of damage to the interior of the Mercedes, but it's not, this is not one of the car bombs or truck bombs we see going off in Iraq.
[01:01:24.191 --> 01:01:32.495]  I mean, what's really striking about this, Keith, is today you had two non-bombs in London, and we had at least five bombs in Baghdad in which U.S.
[01:01:32.915 --> 01:01:34.235]  soldiers were killed in one of those.
[01:01:34.315 --> 01:01:37.136]  So, it's just, I think it's sort of out of proportion.
[01:01:37.176 --> 01:01:40.858]  This was an incendiary, this was not a high explosive.
[01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:49.403]  I've read and heard nothing in any of the coverage here, nothing in these news conferences, about a detonating device apart from a cell phone.
[01:01:49.664 --> 01:01:51.565]  What was supposed to cause this thing to blow up?
[01:01:51.605 --> 01:02:00.151]  Because if we can put together car bombs with half a tank of gas and some propane and an old cell phone, then every drunken Hollywood starlet is a potential car bomber.
[01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:00.431]  Right.
[01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:00.891]  Isn't she?
[01:02:03.192 --> 01:02:10.634]  The fuel, the petrol, the 50 gallons, if you set that on fire, that fire can spark an explosion in a propane tank.
[01:02:10.654 --> 01:02:11.794]  But I've seen those go off.
[01:02:11.814 --> 01:02:14.335]  And when they go off, it's an enormous boom.
[01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:21.016]  It splits the tank, but you're not going to get fragments and projectiles like a hand grenade going off.
[01:02:21.096 --> 01:02:30.738]  So, you wouldn't want to be in the car when it happens, but, you know, if somebody was within, you know, 20, 30 feet of it, they would have ear damage, but not much more.
[01:02:31.378 --> 01:02:33.060]  So we're not talking about shrapnel then?
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:33.680]  Correct.
[01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.222]  This is not a shrapnel-causing device.
[01:02:36.703 --> 01:02:41.446]  And clearly, the folks who put this together, you know, we're looking at yuppie terrorists at a minimum.
[01:02:41.767 --> 01:02:47.711]  They can afford a Mercedes, but they couldn't afford enough money to get a decent class on how to make a bomb that would actually go off.
[01:02:48.012 --> 01:02:48.932]  We're still one.
[01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:49.613]  Thank God.
[01:02:49.673 --> 01:02:52.876]  We're still one, as has been implied here by the police.
[01:02:52.916 --> 01:03:00.622]  But what does alarm you about this other than the media's kind of nodding head doll coverage of this?
[01:03:00.802 --> 01:03:14.244]  Well, I think the other thing that alarms me about it is that we're so ho-hum when we have this body count piling up every day in Baghdad, where daily there are bombs, car bombs, truck bombs going off, and everyone's like, well, okay, just get used to it.
[01:03:14.764 --> 01:03:27.246]  And you have a non-event in London, and we're going to battle quarters and beginning to give the old hairy eyeball to every Muslim, when it's not even clear yet that, you know, all we know is that these are people who could afford a Mercedes.
[01:03:27.507 --> 01:03:30.067]  That's the extent of what we know about this so far.
[01:03:30.587 --> 01:03:32.648]  The practical stuff that maybe should be worrisome.
[01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.189]  Obviously, there are terrorists.
[01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:36.151]  There are people who want to do horrific things.
[01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:37.632]  No question about any of that.
[01:03:37.672 --> 01:03:40.934]  But the idea that we need to fight the terrorists in Iraq.
[01:03:40.974 --> 01:03:42.915]  Gotta fight them there so they don't follow us here.
[01:03:43.576 --> 01:03:46.918]  Whatever this was... Alright, we're gonna be right back with Larry Johnson.
[01:03:46.938 --> 01:03:48.038]  You just heard him on Keith Olbermann.
[01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:48.539]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.633 --> 01:04:02.083]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.444 --> 01:04:10.077]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:17.834]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.234 --> 01:04:29.639]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.959 --> 01:04:33.481]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.921 --> 01:04:35.882]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.182 --> 01:04:40.024]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.587 --> 01:04:58.552]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:04:58.852 --> 01:05:04.297]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:05:04.337 --> 01:05:08.621]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:05:08.962 --> 01:05:11.984]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:05:12.285 --> 01:05:15.728]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:05:16.048 --> 01:05:25.410]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:29.150]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:36.512]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:05:36.752 --> 01:05:38.112]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[01:05:38.172 --> 01:05:39.912]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:45.774 --> 01:05:55.340]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:05:55.861 --> 01:05:57.342]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:05:57.702 --> 01:06:01.525]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:06:01.985 --> 01:06:04.166]  Haven't you heard about CAVX ointment?
[01:06:04.587 --> 01:06:07.929]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:10.731]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:06:11.277 --> 01:06:12.318]  What's that name again?
[01:06:12.718 --> 01:06:13.899]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:06:14.279 --> 01:06:15.460]  It's Calex.
[01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.701]  C-A-L-E-X.
[01:06:18.042 --> 01:06:19.903]  What makes Calex Leutmann so different?
[01:06:20.689 --> 01:06:29.292]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:06:29.752 --> 01:06:35.455]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:06:35.835 --> 01:06:46.959]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:48.738]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:06:49.058 --> 01:06:49.738]  I'll be right back.
[01:06:49.859 --> 01:06:51.600]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[01:06:53.781 --> 01:06:56.003]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.543 --> 01:06:59.325]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.205 --> 01:07:12.848]  In the last hour, we had David Rothschild on, the heir to the major arm of the Rothschild family, pushing a global taxation system in the name of man-made global warming.
[01:07:13.348 --> 01:07:14.588]  Later I'll be commenting on that.
[01:07:14.628 --> 01:07:20.010]  We've got Aaron Dykes in here, who's been doing research for the better part of six months on the history of eugenics.
[01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:24.515]  He'll be with us in the second half of this hour in the studio.
[01:07:24.535 --> 01:07:28.841]  He's been doing research for my new film, Endgame, and I just thought we can't wait with this info we've discovered.
[01:07:28.861 --> 01:07:36.811]  I mean, I know about eugenics, but not how much of this stuff governs the last hundred years or society today under new names.
[01:07:37.511 --> 01:07:38.473]  He'll be joining us.
[01:07:38.493 --> 01:07:39.174]  Then we have a lady
[01:07:39.834 --> 01:07:40.174]  I think so.
[01:07:54.907 --> 01:07:59.232]  I heard some clips from Keith Overman's Countdown with Larry C. Johnson.
[01:07:59.272 --> 01:08:10.824]  He's the CEO of the Business Exposure Reduction Group and we have links to his website berg-associates.com up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:11.364 --> 01:08:17.807]  And if I tried to read his bio, we'd be here all day and burn up our time with him, but he worked previously with the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S.
[01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:19.608]  State Department's Office of Counterterrorism.
[01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:24.850]  He's a recognized expert in the fields of terrorism, aviation security, and crisis and risk management.
[01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:31.853]  Mr. Johnson has analyzed terrorist incidents for a variety of media organizations, from Jim Lehrer NewsHour to National Public Radio, ABC's Nightline,
[01:08:32.493 --> 01:08:34.575]  New York Times, if I went on, it would literally take 10 hours.
[01:08:34.835 --> 01:08:40.960]  He's one of the top 10 terrorism experts in the world, and that's not him saying that.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.041]  That was a major publication.
[01:08:42.321 --> 01:08:44.763]  We appreciate Larry C. Johnson joining us.
[01:08:44.783 --> 01:08:50.828]  You, again, just heard him, if you were tuned in, talking about the mythical hysteria.
[01:08:50.848 --> 01:08:57.093]  In fact, watching Fox News Friday and Saturday, and CNN, but Fox was the worst, this is an exact quote.
[01:08:57.885 --> 01:09:00.666]  A fiery holocaust of doom.
[01:09:01.127 --> 01:09:02.627]  Black billowing smoke.
[01:09:03.188 --> 01:09:03.608]  Fear.
[01:09:04.048 --> 01:09:06.389]  Britain braces for a second blitz.
[01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:15.033]  This is not the blitz with over a thousand Nazi aircraft dropping different types of munitions on London and other cities.
[01:09:15.373 --> 01:09:23.057]  This is not the RAF fighting five to one against the Luftwaffe under Hermann Goering's control.
[01:09:23.437 --> 01:09:23.817]  Is it, sir?
[01:09:27.868 --> 01:09:37.831]  Nothing happened, except for the guys caught their car on fire and drove into the front of the Glasgow Airport, which required the fire department to come out and put out the fire.
[01:09:38.651 --> 01:09:50.114]  So, you know, I don't deny that the intent of these individuals was, you know, call it diabolical, that they would have liked to have killed a bunch of people, that they would like to have done a bunch of damage.
[01:09:50.715 --> 01:09:55.616]  But, you know, we've got to stop confusing desire and intent with capability.
[01:09:56.198 --> 01:10:02.340]  Because if desire and intent was all that counted, we'd all be publisher clearinghouse prize winners.
[01:10:03.721 --> 01:10:05.422]  Well, you're absolutely right about that.
[01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:07.963]  Now, a lot of terrorism is state-sponsored.
[01:10:07.983 --> 01:10:10.864]  A lot of terrorism is carried out by rogue groups.
[01:10:10.924 --> 01:10:16.246]  A woman going on a bus stabbing people or a suicide bomber, a lot of times that really is a local organic thing.
[01:10:16.706 --> 01:10:19.427]  But with this, and when you described them as yuppie bombers,
[01:10:20.327 --> 01:10:27.851]  Every month or so I'm driving down the road in Austin, not that big of a city, and a car is on fire from a wreck or a fuel line busted.
[01:10:28.571 --> 01:10:32.994]  It's not the War of the Worlds type hysteria on the news.
[01:10:33.194 --> 01:10:41.238]  And with these two events and the other completely botched raid, how could they have anti-terror experts, I saw generals and other people,
[01:10:42.078 --> 01:10:46.460]  I don't know why they were experts, but they said they were saying that these were powerful bombs.
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:54.684]  I mean, just from my research, it appears that you're correct that this is an incendiary device and not classified as a bomb.
[01:10:55.664 --> 01:11:04.428]  Yeah, it's a form of a bomb, but I posted on my blog a video of a demonstration that CNN did.
[01:11:05.089 --> 01:11:05.409]  I don't know.
[01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:30.274]  You will see the blast wave, and the blast wave precedes any other fire.
[01:11:31.496 --> 01:11:34.401]  When they get done, the vehicle is crisp.
[01:11:34.581 --> 01:11:36.885]  I mean, it's burnt, but it's largely intact.
[01:11:37.466 --> 01:11:39.669]  In fact, the windshield is still in place.
[01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:40.631]  It blew out the back.
[01:11:41.158 --> 01:11:41.458]  I don't
[01:11:57.026 --> 01:11:57.447]  I think so.
[01:12:20.309 --> 01:12:23.470]  Yeah, I'm sure there was no alcohol involved back then when you did that.
[01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:26.692]  No, there was no alcohol involved.
[01:12:27.313 --> 01:12:30.875]  You don't have to be an expert to be able to draw some of these conclusions.
[01:12:32.452 --> 01:12:33.953]  But don't try this at home, folks!
[01:12:34.113 --> 01:12:35.354]  Oh yeah, no, absolutely not.
[01:12:35.374 --> 01:12:38.917]  But what, I mean, what really is embarrassing is to see people claim to be experts.
[01:12:39.417 --> 01:12:43.800]  And they get on, they say stupid stuff about, oh, this is such a powerful bomb, oh, it was going to kill people.
[01:12:44.281 --> 01:12:47.743]  You know, I guess they've never really seen explosives gone off or understood it.
[01:12:48.824 --> 01:12:51.846]  I caught quite a bit of heat from people who didn't know what they were talking about.
[01:12:51.906 --> 01:12:56.610]  But also, I have friends who are bomb techs and others who are writing and saying, you know, right on.
[01:12:57.549 --> 01:13:06.434]  It is, you know, I believe it is important that people be educated, because at the end of the day, terrorism is not that widespread of an activity.
[01:13:06.574 --> 01:13:07.755]  It is very infrequent.
[01:13:08.255 --> 01:13:15.600]  And candidly, even when we have attacks such as 9-11, I mean, it was a horrible, terrible thing, a horrific loss of life.
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:19.462]  But, you know, at the end of the day, that was a bad day in the Battle of Britain.
[01:13:19.915 --> 01:13:28.158]  You know, and the Battle of Britain went on with literally loss of 3,000 people per day over a period of two or three months.
[01:13:28.819 --> 01:13:32.800]  So I'm just, all I'm asking is that we try to put this stuff in perspective.
[01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:36.082]  It doesn't mean that we accept terrorism and say, well, we just have to learn to live with it.
[01:13:36.582 --> 01:13:38.463]  I don't believe we need to learn to live with it.
[01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:45.906]  But conversely, I do not believe that we need to scare ourselves to death and surrender to the fear
[01:13:46.536 --> 01:13:52.062]  Where we exaggerate the threat of terrorism and end up actually doing the propaganda work for the bad guys.
[01:13:52.243 --> 01:13:52.943]  Well I agree.
[01:13:53.003 --> 01:13:56.728]  Let me just read a couple of different definitions here from Webster's
[01:13:57.922 --> 01:14:08.585]  Only general catastrophic generally agreed upon is that terrorism involves violence and the threat of violence and then there's a bunch of other different definitions here.
[01:14:08.985 --> 01:14:14.846]  Terrorism on the other hand aims to achieve political or other goals when direct military action is not possible.
[01:14:15.346 --> 01:14:22.248]  Terrorism ultimately involves the use of the threat of violence with the aim of creating fear not only in the victims but among the wide audience.
[01:14:22.668 --> 01:14:26.889]  It is fear which distinguishes terrorism from both conventional and guerrilla warfare.
[01:14:26.969 --> 01:14:27.089]  Now
[01:14:27.989 --> 01:14:30.570]  Bill Clinton, of course, pardoned the F.A.L.N.
[01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:53.374]  who carried out over 130 real bombings in the seventies, but because that was, of course, you're the expert, I don't want to get your take on it, but for the audience with some background, police dying, mainly police and military being targeted, more than 15 police blinded because they'd opened the letter bombs and blow their face off, but back then the media kept it very quiet, didn't hype it, because it was real, they didn't want to give the terrorists what they wanted.
[01:14:53.834 --> 01:14:54.754]  What changed now
[01:14:55.414 --> 01:14:57.396]  Well, yeah, they're, let's say, spreaders of fear.
[01:14:57.416 --> 01:14:57.817]  I mean, look,
[01:15:20.217 --> 01:15:21.317]  They are looking for ratings.
[01:15:21.737 --> 01:15:30.980]  This is a great visual and it gives you a chance to provide something that is going to attract public attention.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:46.123]  I was recently involved in scripting and executing a counter-terrorism exercise in which we envisioned the possibility of a bomb blast going off inside the Lincoln Tunnel and realized that as this progressed
[01:15:46.533 --> 01:15:57.536]  You know, all you would, the media would be left with is standing outside with pictures of smoke, potentially water, coming out of that tunnel, and it really doesn't give you a good visual.
[01:15:58.116 --> 01:16:08.939]  So, there are, you know, a flaming car at an airport, great visual, the towers on fire, people jumping, horrific images, but great visuals for, you know, the TV entertainment business.
[01:16:08.979 --> 01:16:15.261]  And unfortunately, this has been driven by entertainment considerations and not any rational consideration about
[01:16:16.214 --> 01:16:21.317]  Actually, what degree of threat do we really face from terrorism?
[01:16:21.797 --> 01:16:39.627]  People just don't want to deal with the reality that it doesn't even begin to compare to the kinds of threats we faced during the Cold War, when the Soviets had a two million plus man army, thousand plus ship, navy, long-range bombers, intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
[01:16:39.947 --> 01:16:42.828]  Well, they could literally incinerate the United States and ours.
[01:16:43.008 --> 01:16:47.989]  We're talking to Larry Johnson, CEO and co-founder of Berg Associates LLC.
[01:16:48.509 --> 01:16:51.090]  Johnson worked previously with the Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S.
[01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:52.730]  State Department's Office of Counterterrorism.
[01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:57.551]  He's a recognized expert in the field of terrorism, aviation security crisis, and risk management.
[01:17:00.052 --> 01:17:00.912]  When we talk about
[01:17:01.602 --> 01:17:03.884]  The Cold War is over.
[01:17:03.904 --> 01:17:12.790]  It's not just the media, which by the way has defense contractors as a lot of their large shareholders and controlling stock in the case of NBC.
[01:17:13.650 --> 01:17:22.396]  Don't we also see that the military industrial complex, which is now pretty much international, not even US, likes terrorism because it helps them have a new business?
[01:17:23.257 --> 01:17:28.020]  Well, I think it's been more the government driving them creating the opportunity.
[01:17:28.635 --> 01:17:30.816]  And then these various companies taking advantage of it.
[01:17:30.916 --> 01:17:35.959]  I mean, I remember back in 1990-91 trying to interest the U.S.
[01:17:35.999 --> 01:17:46.626]  Military Conventional Commands, Southern Command, Central Command, European Command, to participate in and do counterterrorism exercises.
[01:17:47.266 --> 01:17:49.447]  And they said, nah, that's a waste of our time.
[01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:54.211]  That they all claim to be that part of the mission is fighting terrorism.
[01:17:54.311 --> 01:17:54.772]  Well, why?
[01:17:55.172 --> 01:18:01.337]  Well, from a budget standpoint, and their ability to increase their budget, that's where the action is.
[01:18:01.417 --> 01:18:03.138]  If you're fighting terrorism, you get money.
[01:18:03.158 --> 01:18:05.320]  If you're not fighting terrorism, you don't get money.
[01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.902]  So it's just a human response here.
[01:18:08.702 --> 01:18:10.323]  The government's feeling the political pressure.
[01:18:10.363 --> 01:18:11.783]  We've got to be seen as doing something.
[01:18:11.803 --> 01:18:24.607]  You know, I've said tongue-in-cheek that one of the solutions that came up in the aftermath of 9-11 was to create a new intelligence bureaucracy by adding the Director of National Intelligence, the DNI.
[01:18:25.147 --> 01:18:27.888]  And I said that's exactly why we were attacked on 9-11.
[01:18:28.228 --> 01:18:30.309]  We didn't have enough government bureaucracy.
[01:18:31.329 --> 01:18:35.591]  We just didn't have enough people sitting behind desks stovepiping information.
[01:18:36.781 --> 01:18:37.601]  Make us safer.
[01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:41.102]  Now that's the sarcasm coming out.
[01:18:41.142 --> 01:18:42.763]  Larry C. Johnson, stay with us.
[01:18:42.823 --> 01:18:43.763]  Final segment with you.
[01:18:43.783 --> 01:18:44.203]  Quick break.
[01:18:44.243 --> 01:18:51.606]  I want to come back and talk about the different types of terrorism and how big a threat you write it in the scheme of things.
[01:18:55.737 --> 01:18:59.860]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:19:00.081 --> 01:19:01.842]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:19:02.122 --> 01:19:08.407]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:19:08.687 --> 01:19:14.812]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:19:15.073 --> 01:19:16.834]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:19:16.834 --> 01:19:17.354]  We're good.

[01:19:43.767 --> 01:19:43.827]  1-866-885-6625.
[01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:44.427]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:19:44.568 --> 01:19:44.668]  July 6, 2007.

[01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:47.189]  $1.64.
[01:19:47.229 --> 01:19:47.469]  $88 for quarter.
[01:19:47.489 --> 01:19:47.809]  That's $6.68.
[01:19:47.849 --> 01:19:47.809]  $23.29.
[01:19:47.989 --> 01:19:48.129]  $75 and $1.64. $88.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:14.385]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[01:20:14.485 --> 01:20:18.148]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:19.149]  Bad news for U.S.
[01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.649]  currency.
[01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:22.052]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:20:22.212 --> 01:20:23.673]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[01:20:23.913 --> 01:20:25.975]  Dollars fall into 65% of euro.
[01:20:26.135 --> 01:20:27.136]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:27.176 --> 01:20:27.356]  That's 800-686-2237.

[01:22:45.977 --> 01:22:46.637]  Do it today!
[01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:23.018]  I'll just tell Larry Johnson, point blank, he probably looked into his show, he was coming on before he did, that, you know, I cover Operation Northwoods, I cover the USS Liberty, Gulf of Tonkin, the staged provocateur actions, the overthrow of Mosedec in 53, the CIA declassified after action reports about how staged terrorism brought down that government.
[01:23:23.779 --> 01:23:31.262]  But there is real terrorism, and there is true organic terrorism out there, there's certainly no debating that, and these guys fit the bill.
[01:23:32.074 --> 01:23:39.901]  And then we have just the response, though, the literal opportunism of the media and the government and everything else.
[01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:41.122]  I know this.
[01:23:41.222 --> 01:23:53.193]  I mean, I've got international OECD numbers that you're 400 times roughly, it depends on which country you're in, but the average is about 400 times more likely to be killed in a car accident than by a terrorist.
[01:23:53.593 --> 01:23:56.615]  And that's with the new expanded definitions of terrorism.
[01:23:56.655 --> 01:24:01.879]  And then I see the police state unfolding in my country, the checkpoints, the surveillance.
[01:24:02.819 --> 01:24:08.763]  Meanwhile, our government just loves Saudi Arabia, which is obviously a real engine of some terrorism.
[01:24:09.664 --> 01:24:17.049]  What are your comments, both on provocateur terrorism, you know, AP, Jerusalem Post reported on Israel, quote, creating fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[01:24:17.569 --> 01:24:19.991]  Every time there's a peace deal about to happen, there's a convenient bomb.
[01:24:20.371 --> 01:24:23.053]  Do you think... I mean, do you have any comments on that controversial subject?
[01:24:23.074 --> 01:24:29.078]  And then, B, where do you see terrorism going in the future and the loss of liberties here in the United States and worldwide?
[01:24:29.479 --> 01:24:40.207]  Well, my biggest concern is that we will allow the fear of terrorism to compromise and even surrender our civil liberties.
[01:24:41.028 --> 01:24:43.570]  And we've seen elements of that that
[01:24:44.854 --> 01:24:54.941]  Particularly in the aftermath of 9-11, we've been willing to accept, albeit small cases, but nonetheless American citizens being held without access to counsel.
[01:24:55.622 --> 01:24:58.844]  We've endorsed torture and allowed torture to go forward.
[01:24:59.325 --> 01:25:08.171]  So I think in all of these instances, we have to recognize that if we allow the fear to drive us to direct our decision-making,
[01:25:08.897 --> 01:25:12.680]  Uh, we're going to wind up as a poorer country because of it.
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:20.345]  So I think, first and foremost, that's why I think we need to stand against the fear and encourage people to not give in on that front.
[01:25:20.605 --> 01:25:26.169]  But our media and our Democratic and Republican leaders, they just throw themselves with wanton abandon.
[01:25:26.529 --> 01:25:29.151]  I mean, to watch a press conference or to watch the
[01:25:29.631 --> 01:25:31.212]  Well, I think they have to be informed.
[01:25:31.232 --> 01:25:32.332]  They have to be willing to be informed.
[01:25:32.352 --> 01:25:33.673]  I don't get that alarm, per se.
[01:25:49.531 --> 01:25:49.831]  I don't know.
[01:26:05.021 --> 01:26:06.642]  They're not going to be responsible.
[01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:08.102]  They're not going to go out and be measured.
[01:26:08.122 --> 01:26:11.363]  They're going to run after the story and fan the flames if they can.
[01:26:11.563 --> 01:26:20.506]  Okay, well, I'm measured, and I'm not saying I'm a perfect person, but I mean, I'm not afraid of the terrorists, you know, wherever they come from.
[01:26:20.666 --> 01:26:23.106]  I am afraid of the military-industrial complex.
[01:26:23.547 --> 01:26:27.948]  Well, and I think that's why you take time to talk about it on your show.
[01:26:28.886 --> 01:26:36.870]  And to take a chance to allow people to debate it and to discuss it without having to worry about being compressed into some soundbite.
[01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:41.293]  So, to that extent... You know, I think you're right.
[01:26:41.553 --> 01:26:44.134]  This is Radio vs. TV, so that's a great point.
[01:26:44.154 --> 01:26:44.634]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:44.935 --> 01:26:51.438]  No, I just think you're doing a public service in what you're doing, and that's why I think it's important to have as many voices out there.
[01:26:51.877 --> 01:27:01.327]  You know, we may not all agree upon, you know, different issues, but at least to have an informed dialogue underway where people can have a chance to say, OK, look, I agree with that.
[01:27:01.347 --> 01:27:02.207]  I disagree with that.
[01:27:02.648 --> 01:27:04.470]  But at least you're discussing it.
[01:27:04.670 --> 01:27:05.691]  And I think that's what's important.
[01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.649]  Well, I agree.
[01:27:06.689 --> 01:27:19.611]  I think the process of Americans becoming informed again, or just trying to be informed, doesn't mean we're all that smart or have all the answers, but at least people need to learn the basics of our world or we're not going to have freedom for long.
[01:27:19.631 --> 01:27:24.512]  I think ignorance really is the ether that tyranny swims in.
[01:27:25.192 --> 01:27:29.693]  Do you see the threat of terrorism increasing or decreasing in the next five years?
[01:27:30.273 --> 01:27:31.633]  Actually, I think it's going to diminish.
[01:27:32.294 --> 01:27:34.474]  Part of it depends upon what we continue to do.
[01:27:35.399 --> 01:27:46.805]  In Iraq, but what we've, we saw a very dramatic surge in the number of terrorist incidents in 2003, and then into 2004, continued into 2005.
[01:27:47.905 --> 01:27:53.028]  But, what we saw last year actually, even though the state, the U.S.
[01:27:53.048 --> 01:27:59.791]  government changed its methodology for counting terrorism, it did it deliberately, in my judgment, to make it appear worse than what it is.
[01:28:00.291 --> 01:28:03.793]  But if you go through that data and look at exactly
[01:28:04.301 --> 01:28:05.702]  Where are the attacks occurring?
[01:28:06.162 --> 01:28:07.283]  Who is being attacked?
[01:28:07.323 --> 01:28:17.788]  What you get is, in the picture, is the fact that the number of terrorist international incidents, incidents in which people from two or more countries are involved, that has declined.
[01:28:17.868 --> 01:28:24.291]  And I think it can continue to decline because other governments, Muslim governments in particular, are willing to go after the extremists.
[01:28:24.671 --> 01:28:29.054]  All right, we've got links to your blog and your official website on InfoWars.com.
[01:28:29.534 --> 01:28:31.455]  And Larry Johnson, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:28:33.468 --> 01:28:36.569]  Alright folks, we'll be right back with Aaron Dykes in studio.
[01:28:37.850 --> 01:28:39.010]  You'll want to record this.
[01:28:39.170 --> 01:28:40.090]  Dealing with eugenics.
[01:28:43.872 --> 01:28:44.792]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.272 --> 01:28:46.873]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.793 --> 01:28:50.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.874 --> 01:28:56.595]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:28:57.035 --> 01:29:02.718]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally, without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:29:03.198 --> 01:29:05.359]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:29:05.519 --> 01:29:06.900]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:11.281]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[01:29:11.622 --> 01:29:14.723]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:29:15.023 --> 01:29:16.264]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[01:29:17.484 --> 01:29:25.769]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.

[01:29:54.711 --> 01:29:55.932]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[01:29:56.492 --> 01:29:57.172]  News alert!

[01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:02.894]  Concise?
[01:30:03.174 --> 01:30:03.794]  Hard-hitting?
[01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:07.096]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[01:30:07.116 --> 01:30:08.616]  War in Iran?
[01:30:08.636 --> 01:30:10.817]  A coming One World Church?
[01:30:11.577 --> 01:30:16.882]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[01:30:55.245 --> 01:30:56.066]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:56.286 --> 01:31:01.489]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[01:31:01.829 --> 01:31:03.309]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:03.409 --> 01:31:05.390]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:05.671 --> 01:31:11.213]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:11.514 --> 01:31:17.797]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:18.117 --> 01:31:20.298]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:20.578 --> 01:31:24.021]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:31:24.281 --> 01:31:24.641]  Whoa!
[01:31:25.081 --> 01:31:26.262]  What was that website again?
[01:31:26.362 --> 01:31:29.865]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:30.185 --> 01:31:31.286]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:31.446 --> 01:31:35.749]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:36.470]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:36.750 --> 01:31:37.951]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:38.351 --> 01:31:39.012]  Check, please!
[01:31:40.753 --> 01:31:42.254]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:31:42.734 --> 01:31:43.335]  Sure, John.
[01:31:43.555 --> 01:31:47.918]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:48.238 --> 01:31:49.939]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:50.099 --> 01:31:50.439]  Deal.
[01:31:54.121 --> 01:31:56.283]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:31:56.863 --> 01:31:59.705]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:01.906 --> 01:32:03.227]  We've got Kitty Werthmann.
[01:32:04.808 --> 01:32:20.445]  Joining us here in a few minutes, Erin will be with us the entire third hour getting into the history of eugenics and the dovetails with the guest we're about to be speaking with who grew up in Nazi Germany and she parallels in her new book, amazing new book, with what's happening today in the U.S.
[01:32:21.804 --> 01:32:24.265]  First off, I want to tell you about inert food, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:24.325 --> 01:32:29.286]  Bad nutrition is a breeding ground for illness due to stress, anxiety, not to mention the chemtrails.
[01:32:29.386 --> 01:32:31.687]  Ask yourself, what is your diet like?
[01:32:31.727 --> 01:32:36.608]  Processed foods and even good organics don't have the nutritional values that you need in today's world.
[01:32:36.908 --> 01:32:37.449]  Think about it.
[01:32:37.569 --> 01:32:41.950]  Have you forgotten that you're supposed to feel good and energetic all day long and have not?
[01:32:42.450 --> 01:32:44.031]  You aren't getting the nutrition you need?
[01:32:44.071 --> 01:32:49.415]  Stop wishing you had more energy and focus and make it happen today with one simple phone call.
[01:32:49.435 --> 01:32:55.319]  1-866-762-9238 or visit them on the web at www.interfood.com.
[01:32:55.700 --> 01:32:59.482]  That's www.interfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[01:32:59.863 --> 01:33:00.683]  I take it every morning.
[01:33:00.723 --> 01:33:01.884]  Best green food out there.
[01:33:01.904 --> 01:33:03.245]  Aaron Dykes is in the office.
[01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:05.206]  He's enjoying the supply they sent us.
[01:33:05.226 --> 01:33:05.807]  He's taking it.
[01:33:06.427 --> 01:33:12.951]  And it really kills the cravings for food, because you want to eat, eat, eat, because the processed junk we're eating doesn't have the nutrients we need.
[01:33:13.331 --> 01:33:14.092]  Interfood does.
[01:33:14.132 --> 01:33:19.035]  Go check them out at www.interfood.com or 866-762-9238.
[01:33:22.297 --> 01:33:30.222]  And I haven't plugged this yet today, and I really need to, folks, because it's a big part of the solution in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:33:31.222 --> 01:33:32.503]  I have produced 15 films.
[01:33:33.304 --> 01:33:35.385]  Now you could say I guess 15 and a half, because
[01:33:36.164 --> 01:33:47.008]  The second edition, and it is the final cut, it is a really, if you want to determine it properly, it is a special edition of Terror Storm, is now out, is now available, is now in stock, is now shipping.
[01:33:48.949 --> 01:33:54.631]  It is a, well it's three hours and twenty plus minutes total on the DVD.
[01:33:55.111 --> 01:33:57.051]  Sixty seven minutes of extras.
[01:33:58.172 --> 01:34:01.193]  It's a hundred and thirty plus minute film.
[01:34:02.502 --> 01:34:06.403]  Seventeen new minutes added on the Inside Job on 9-11.
[01:34:06.763 --> 01:34:07.883]  The new information on 7-7.
[01:34:08.283 --> 01:34:10.464]  BBC announcing it was going to collapse before it did.
[01:34:10.944 --> 01:34:11.924]  Saying it had collapsed.
[01:34:12.905 --> 01:34:14.405]  Governor Jesse Ventura is interviewed.
[01:34:14.465 --> 01:34:16.966]  Gore Vidal, historian, is interviewed.
[01:34:16.986 --> 01:34:18.306]  His father founded NORAD.
[01:34:19.246 --> 01:34:20.186]  Just so much more.
[01:34:20.386 --> 01:34:22.707]  CIA officials going public with Inside Job.
[01:34:23.027 --> 01:34:25.268]  Like Bill Christensen, former CIA Section Chief.
[01:34:25.868 --> 01:34:27.448]  That's the seventeen minutes that are added.
[01:34:27.488 --> 01:34:28.388]  It's been remastered.
[01:34:28.408 --> 01:34:30.889]  New audio, new video added throughout the film.
[01:34:31.982 --> 01:34:34.544]  It's just basically, you know, we put the film out in a rush.
[01:34:34.604 --> 01:34:35.404]  It was a great film.
[01:34:35.764 --> 01:34:38.566]  And we went back and spent three or four months adding to it, souping it up.
[01:34:39.126 --> 01:34:40.727]  And that's what you get in the special edition.
[01:34:40.807 --> 01:34:48.571]  And with your purchase of Terror Storm, the history of government-sponsored terror, you also support this show and what we're doing.
[01:34:50.072 --> 01:34:53.473]  So again, please go to InfoWars.com and order the new Terror Storm.
[01:34:53.533 --> 01:34:54.614]  Or get Riddles in Stone.
[01:34:55.454 --> 01:34:56.735]  Or Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:34:56.815 --> 01:34:58.276]  Or America Freedom to Fascism.
[01:34:58.932 --> 01:35:01.406]  The original high quality films from the filmmakers.
[01:35:01.426 --> 01:35:02.794]  So you're also supporting them.
[01:35:05.023 --> 01:35:07.564]  You can also call toll-free to order the films 888-253-3139.

[01:35:34.310 --> 01:35:35.471]  We're good to go.
[01:35:48.178 --> 01:36:04.325]  a arsenal in the info war prisonplanet.tv or 888-253-3139 to order the different films that can answer questions about different specials, different books and videos we're carrying, or infowars.com.
[01:36:04.465 --> 01:36:13.329]  Okay, let's go now to Kitty Werthmann, just an amazing individual and instead of going over her bio,
[01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:25.205]  Uh, it is, it is better to just go to her who lived in Austria, I kept saying Germany, same thing, same area, same empire, under Adolf Hitler's regime for seven years.
[01:36:25.866 --> 01:36:33.869]  Dictatorship did not happen overnight, it was a gradual process, starting with national identification cards, which we had to carry with us at all times.
[01:36:34.209 --> 01:36:39.351]  And then she just goes, the gun registration followed, with a lot of talk about gun safety and hunting accidents.
[01:36:39.751 --> 01:36:43.773]  And she says everything she saw as a young girl, up until she was twelve,
[01:36:44.904 --> 01:36:45.805]  Well, seven years.
[01:36:46.025 --> 01:36:53.474]  Imagine being, I guess, five years old up to 12, seeing him take over Austria, seeing him do all this, and now seeing it manifest.
[01:36:54.355 --> 01:37:00.241]  By the way, the 1968 Gun Control Act is the Nazi Gun Control Act, word for word, just translated to English.
[01:37:00.301 --> 01:37:06.168]  So, the black uniforms, everything, and so many historians who lived there at the time wrote about how
[01:37:07.566 --> 01:37:19.734]  It happened incrementally, overnight, and so we've got to have her up for a full hour in the near future, but we've got her for about 20 minutes today, 22 minutes today, and Kitty Werthmann, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:37:20.714 --> 01:37:21.635]  You're so welcome.
[01:37:22.195 --> 01:37:29.380]  Tell us about your book, Out of the Gates, and about where you grew up, the town where you grew up, and then what you witnessed, and then the parallels with the US.
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:31.401]  It's not a book, it's a CD.
[01:37:33.971 --> 01:37:37.192]  Okay, because my producer said he had read it.
[01:37:37.232 --> 01:37:39.653]  I guess he'd read the website and the documents about it.
[01:37:39.733 --> 01:37:41.654]  Well, yes, there is a website, yes.
[01:37:42.414 --> 01:37:49.456]  I was 12 years old when we elected Hitler in Austria.
[01:37:50.256 --> 01:38:01.760]  Now, how would you believe that a Christian nation, 98% Catholic, would elect a monster like Hitler?
[01:38:02.662 --> 01:38:08.724]  Well, the fact is that Hitler did not appear to be a monster at all.
[01:38:09.804 --> 01:38:15.005]  Austria, in 1938, I was 12 years old, 6th grade.
[01:38:16.465 --> 01:38:19.886]  We were in a very, very deep depression.
[01:38:22.887 --> 01:38:27.428]  Inflation was 25%, and if you borrowed money from the banks,
[01:38:31.078 --> 01:38:34.059]  You paid 25% interest.
[01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:45.004]  We had nearly one-third of our workforce unemployed because people didn't have any money.
[01:38:46.565 --> 01:38:59.911]  And so we had, on the average in my home, about three people come knocking on the door for a slice of bread and a bowl of soup.
[01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:10.167]  Well, I want to go back and be specific about what's on this CD, and then why you decided to put this together, and then let's go to the parallels of what you witnessed.
[01:39:10.187 --> 01:39:14.250]  But specifically, because I want to plug this and get this out to people, and I'm told the copy's on its way here.
[01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:16.991]  I want to see it and read the information in it.
[01:39:17.031 --> 01:39:18.252]  But tell us what's on the CD.
[01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:26.877]  Well, we nearly had anarchy in the streets because there were two political factions fighting each other.
[01:39:27.398 --> 01:39:29.419]  On one side, the Communist Party,
[01:39:30.270 --> 01:39:33.551]  Who also wanted to get into power.
[01:39:34.171 --> 01:39:38.352]  And the other side, the National Socialist Party, Hitler's party.
[01:39:39.172 --> 01:39:41.453]  And we were begging for law and order.
[01:39:42.033 --> 01:39:44.974]  So we had a plebiscite, an election.
[01:39:44.994 --> 01:39:47.235]  We certainly did not want to go communist.
[01:39:47.535 --> 01:39:52.736]  But your president also got shot and bled to death on his couch, so this wasn't exactly a real election.
[01:39:53.356 --> 01:39:54.296]  That was in 1934.
[01:39:56.656 --> 01:40:13.840]  Our president, Engelbert Dolfuss, who was a conservative and very anti-communist, and we don't even know to this day was it the Nazis who assassinated him or the communists.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:24.342]  So we begged for an election, a plebiscite, and there was absolutely no information out
[01:40:25.017 --> 01:40:26.858]  That's what Hitler was all about.
[01:40:27.439 --> 01:40:30.560]  Hitler ruled in Germany since 1933.
[01:40:31.061 --> 01:40:33.022]  That was our neighbor to the north.
[01:40:33.682 --> 01:40:38.985]  They had a high living standard, they had full employment, and they had law and order.
[01:40:39.486 --> 01:40:40.767]  So we said, why not?
[01:40:42.668 --> 01:40:46.750]  There is only a border between us, like South and North Dakota.
[01:40:48.051 --> 01:40:54.535]  And we had the same language, the same culture, we were of the same Germanic extraction.
[01:40:55.197 --> 01:40:59.821]  Except there was a border between us, so we said, why not annex to Germany?
[01:41:00.362 --> 01:41:08.248]  And we would have law and order, and Hitler guaranteed us full employment within three or four weeks.
[01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:16.055]  And we were desperate, so we voted for Hitler by 98% of the ballot.
[01:41:16.075 --> 01:41:21.580]  Okay, so starting when you're 12 then, go through the progression and what they did and what you saw in the next seven years.
[01:41:22.566 --> 01:41:33.591]  Well, March 13th, when I walked into my classroom, public school, we had prayer in school before we started class and afterwards.
[01:41:34.372 --> 01:41:39.234]  And we also had religion twice a week being taught in school.
[01:41:39.915 --> 01:41:48.799]  I walked into my classroom and the crucifix was gone and there was Hitler's picture and the Nazi flag on either side.
[01:41:49.924 --> 01:41:52.665]  And our teacher told us today, we don't pray anymore.
[01:41:53.306 --> 01:41:57.288]  We will sing Deutschland, Deutschland über alles, the national anthem.
[01:41:58.508 --> 01:42:02.690]  And we would not have religious instruction anymore.
[01:42:02.730 --> 01:42:05.411]  We would have physical education instead.
[01:42:06.232 --> 01:42:15.636]  And on Sunday, we would have compulsory National Youth Day, which was compulsory to attend.
[01:42:16.417 --> 01:42:19.038]  And if our parents would not send us,
[01:42:19.764 --> 01:42:23.227]  The first time they would get a very stiff letter of warning.
[01:42:23.247 --> 01:42:29.972]  The second time we did not attend, they would have to pay a hefty fine.
[01:42:29.992 --> 01:42:32.694]  Now by the way, we don't have to do that here.
[01:42:32.735 --> 01:42:38.299]  We just have public school and people hand their children willingly over to be indoctrinated five days a week.
[01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:44.324]  Now they want to boost school up to eight o'clock at night so the parents can go to the gym or the bar and they're taking the children away from us.
[01:42:44.364 --> 01:42:45.084]  But please continue.
[01:42:46.085 --> 01:42:49.288]  So on Sunday, we naturally, we attended
[01:42:49.910 --> 01:43:00.573]  Instead of going to church at 8 o'clock in the morning for National Youth Day, at the first two hours we had political education.
[01:43:01.254 --> 01:43:07.255]  Today I would call it political indoctrination because that's what it was.
[01:43:07.355 --> 01:43:13.497]  Yeah, global warming, we need a global tax, guns are bad, you go through all that too.
[01:43:13.517 --> 01:43:14.077]  Yes.
[01:43:14.097 --> 01:43:15.818]  Describe what it was like, the indoctrination.
[01:43:16.457 --> 01:43:21.219]  Well, first we were being told that we shouldn't listen to our parents anymore.
[01:43:21.399 --> 01:43:24.480]  By the way, that is an official Time Magazine and Newsweek for kids.
[01:43:24.801 --> 01:43:27.602]  We've caught them over and over again in the textbooks actually saying that.
[01:43:27.642 --> 01:43:28.022]  Go ahead.
[01:43:28.822 --> 01:43:33.985]  They were old-fashioned and they certainly did not have
[01:43:36.197 --> 01:43:38.798]  The modern idea of freedom.
[01:43:38.978 --> 01:43:54.522]  By the way, we have that word-for-word in my film, Police State to the Takeover, with the BATF-funded classes now in almost every school, thousands of school districts, coast-to-coast, where it says, your parents are old-fashioned and don't know about this, don't tell them.
[01:43:54.802 --> 01:43:55.462]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:56.243 --> 01:43:59.563]  So, we were being told that we had a right to freedom.
[01:44:00.284 --> 01:44:01.264]  We had rights.
[01:44:01.724 --> 01:44:04.985]  We don't dare listen to our parents anymore.
[01:44:05.911 --> 01:44:07.292]  Only to Hitler.
[01:44:07.452 --> 01:44:09.614]  He had the best intention for us.
[01:44:09.914 --> 01:44:13.677]  Which is what the EU, the EU's doing that now and it's happening here in the US.
[01:44:13.977 --> 01:44:15.999]  Don't listen to your parents, the state cares about you.
[01:44:16.019 --> 01:44:16.379]  Go ahead.
[01:44:17.220 --> 01:44:19.621]  So we only should listen to Hitler.
[01:44:20.222 --> 01:44:23.444]  He, we were being the future of the country.
[01:44:24.005 --> 01:44:26.607]  So we argued with our parents all the time.
[01:44:26.947 --> 01:44:29.809]  Absolutely all the time because we said we have rights.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.021]  We can do what we want to.
[01:44:32.041 --> 01:44:33.381]  And the same thing is done here.
[01:44:33.401 --> 01:44:38.183]  The quote liberals, Dr. Spock, the rest of them come in and that's not the guy from Star Trek.
[01:44:38.203 --> 01:44:40.304]  Every time I mention that I get an email.
[01:44:40.344 --> 01:44:43.725]  He sold more books than the Bible in the 60s and 70s here in the US.
[01:44:43.905 --> 01:44:48.407]  They tell you don't discipline your children, don't train them, let them dress how they want, let them do what they want.
[01:44:48.687 --> 01:44:54.689]  That's only so they then have enmity against you and don't respect you so the state can do the indoctrination, not you.
[01:44:54.729 --> 01:44:55.069]  Go ahead.
[01:44:55.089 --> 01:44:59.951]  So we have argued with our parents all the time.
[01:45:00.603 --> 01:45:16.149]  Well, my mother announced when my next school term rolled around that she was taking me out of that horrible public school and put me into a private school where I would have an excellent curriculum, but not very much fun.
[01:45:17.009 --> 01:45:24.132]  Sure enough, I was being packed off and put into a private school with an excellent curriculum.
[01:45:25.869 --> 01:45:31.753]  Not much fun like we had, because we were getting in public school all the sports equipment free.
[01:45:31.953 --> 01:45:34.494]  Yeah, the Nazis made it all real fun, exactly.
[01:45:34.795 --> 01:45:35.855]  We had lots of fun.
[01:45:35.915 --> 01:45:37.736]  Getting you ready for war, getting you in shape.
[01:45:37.956 --> 01:45:42.479]  We had physical education and lots of sports.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.000]  Lots of sports.
[01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:46.462]  And all the equipment we got free.
[01:45:46.482 --> 01:45:50.964]  Because they knew it would create tribalism and basically a bestial mentality.
[01:45:51.765 --> 01:45:51.945]  Right.
[01:45:54.377 --> 01:46:08.370]  Of course, first I didn't like it in this private school, but then, later on, as I would come home again on holidays, on vacations, and I would mix again with my former classmates, and what I saw, I did not like.
[01:46:09.111 --> 01:46:14.215]  Sixteen-year-old girls were being pregnant and having a baby for Hitler.
[01:46:14.896 --> 01:46:19.260]  And that was so highly praised and glorified.
[01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:28.225]  And on and on, and nobody would go to church anymore, you know, they didn't need... And of course, Hitler openly wrote that was to be fodder on the front lines.
[01:46:29.806 --> 01:46:34.709]  We did not need religion anymore because Hitler was God himself.
[01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:39.412]  So also, we were getting a new government.
[01:46:40.452 --> 01:46:43.334]  And nobody got elected anymore.
[01:46:44.014 --> 01:46:49.618]  And also, Hitler was a very clever, I would say again,
[01:46:50.336 --> 01:46:53.318]  A very clever politician.
[01:46:53.719 --> 01:46:56.581]  He talked like an American politician.
[01:46:58.563 --> 01:47:06.589]  And we had seven states, and he merged the seven states into four regions.
[01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:12.734]  Four regions, just like you're doing now, and he also created regional boards, which really have the authority, correct?
[01:47:13.214 --> 01:47:13.434]  Right.
[01:47:14.035 --> 01:47:19.379]  So our seven states were merged into four because we were being told
[01:47:19.986 --> 01:47:27.567]  That it was a lot easier to govern four states than... Yeah, we're always told, get rid of separation of powers, streamline everything.
[01:47:27.807 --> 01:47:31.648]  You also talk about how they created national ID cards, demonized guns.
[01:47:32.068 --> 01:47:32.308]  Yes.
[01:47:33.128 --> 01:47:41.230]  Well, also, um, the news media, the radio station was being nationalized.
[01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:43.770]  The government run our radio station.
[01:47:43.810 --> 01:47:47.571]  By the way, have you heard the Democrats are now calling for shutting down Freedom on talk radio?
[01:47:47.911 --> 01:47:48.811]  Yes, I heard that.
[01:47:49.665 --> 01:47:51.526]  So we were given free radios.
[01:47:51.766 --> 01:47:53.087]  Everybody got a radio.
[01:47:53.387 --> 01:47:58.509]  So we could listen to all what Hitler was going to give us and what he was going to do for us.
[01:48:00.010 --> 01:48:06.012]  And we even had a Cabinet Ministry of Propaganda.
[01:48:07.653 --> 01:48:08.793]  Dr. Googles.
[01:48:09.034 --> 01:48:12.815]  And he was on the radio every day and we had to listen to him.
[01:48:14.196 --> 01:48:19.038]  And then we also, like I said, nobody got elected anymore.
[01:48:19.671 --> 01:48:41.348]  Everybody was appointed from the City Commission, County Commission, School Board, Legislature... Now here they've just replaced it with boards that are over those that are unelected, but have you heard about Bush now erasing the governors during time of emergency and during resistance and saying that he's above all the branches of government?
[01:48:41.368 --> 01:48:42.869]  I mean, that is the furor precept.
[01:48:43.590 --> 01:48:46.872]  Administrative rules, it's called.
[01:48:47.352 --> 01:48:47.553]  Yes.
[01:48:49.739 --> 01:48:57.143]  So, we also had to have ID cards, so that everybody was being identified.
[01:48:57.243 --> 01:49:00.585]  And you carried your ID card at all times.
[01:49:01.205 --> 01:49:05.327]  You couldn't even board a bus or a train without an ID card.
[01:49:05.367 --> 01:49:06.148]  And they're now doing that.
[01:49:06.168 --> 01:49:08.609]  They're demanding to buy beer, cigarettes.
[01:49:08.869 --> 01:49:11.330]  Now they're saying for everything, you've got to show it everywhere you go.
[01:49:11.611 --> 01:49:12.771]  Can't buy or sell without it.
[01:49:12.791 --> 01:49:13.332]  Please continue.
[01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:17.762]  So then, of course, we got new laws.
[01:49:18.062 --> 01:49:24.406]  One of the most important laws which were being passed was the Equal Rights Amendment.
[01:49:24.587 --> 01:49:26.007]  Equal rights for women.
[01:49:26.428 --> 01:49:27.729]  And that went over big.
[01:49:28.409 --> 01:49:31.931]  I did not know one woman who was not for equal rights.
[01:49:32.172 --> 01:49:35.034]  Now, again, the Rockefellers have told us why they do this.
[01:49:35.514 --> 01:49:39.757]  Get both people working now in the factories, get the children full-time,
[01:49:40.666 --> 01:49:41.267]  Stay there.
[01:49:41.987 --> 01:49:45.530]  Adolf Hitler's plan from the eyes of an Austrian.
[01:49:45.610 --> 01:49:48.372]  When we get back, please stay with us.
[01:49:49.412 --> 01:49:50.373]  We're talking to Ms.
[01:49:50.393 --> 01:49:50.813]  Worthman.
[01:49:54.176 --> 01:49:59.820]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:02.281]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.642 --> 01:50:10.247]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.976 --> 01:50:18.021]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.421 --> 01:50:29.848]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spy, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.168 --> 01:50:33.671]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.131 --> 01:50:36.072]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.392 --> 01:50:40.235]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.334 --> 01:50:58.417]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:58.497 --> 01:51:05.802]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.942 --> 01:51:14.567]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazines,

[01:51:53.385 --> 01:51:55.086]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.327 --> 01:51:59.029]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been murderized.

[01:52:08.436 --> 01:52:13.340]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.540 --> 01:52:22.507]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:52:54.373 --> 01:53:01.056]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.677 --> 01:53:11.740]  By the way, Dr. Stan Monteith puts out the video, and it's got text in it as well, on a CD of Kitty's experience.
[01:53:12.781 --> 01:53:14.721]  Kitty Werthmann in Nazi Germany.
[01:53:14.741 --> 01:53:21.424]  I'm gonna keep her five minutes into the next hour, then we got Aaron Dykes in here with the whole eugenics agenda that was publicly funded by the Rockefellers and others.
[01:53:23.138 --> 01:53:28.162]  And that is the overarching plan they've got today with the phony environmentalism and the rest of it.
[01:53:28.483 --> 01:53:30.564]  Continue, because we've only got about ten minutes left with you, Kitty.
[01:53:31.005 --> 01:53:34.587]  I mean, bang through the parallels, the examples that you were covering.
[01:53:35.248 --> 01:53:38.070]  Well, the Equal Rights Amendment was used for two reasons.
[01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:50.420]  To equalize the country's wealth by raising taxes and giving to those, everybody had a right to
[01:53:52.239 --> 01:53:53.479]  A guaranteed income.
[01:53:54.020 --> 01:54:03.122]  So they have to raise the taxes up to 70% to bring those people, the have-nots, up to an equal level.
[01:54:03.603 --> 01:54:10.185]  The other reason was that everybody in a socialistic society has to be in the workforce.
[01:54:10.585 --> 01:54:13.946]  So the moms have to be out into the workforce.
[01:54:14.466 --> 01:54:19.127]  So the state took over the children and put them into daycare.
[01:54:19.968 --> 01:54:21.228]  We called it kindergarten.
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:31.245]  And you could leave your children there from age six weeks, as long as you want, seven days a week, whatever.
[01:54:31.265 --> 01:54:37.148]  The longer they could have their hands on your children, the better they liked it.
[01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:43.092]  Because the child care providers, they were not the grandmotherly type.
[01:54:43.532 --> 01:54:50.636]  They were highly trained professionals in child psychology, how to mold the children
[01:54:51.218 --> 01:54:52.919]  How the state wanted them.
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:55.842]  So that was the Equal Rights Amendment.
[01:54:56.402 --> 01:54:59.425]  Then we also had euthanasia.
[01:55:00.906 --> 01:55:10.434]  As my education progressed in years and years, my major was education.
[01:55:11.175 --> 01:55:16.179]  So I was sent to do my practice teaching in a small Austrian village.
[01:55:17.783 --> 01:55:30.495]  And as I was told in that village, they had about 15 mentally disabled people, and one I know very well, who was the janitor in the school I taught.
[01:55:31.576 --> 01:55:41.225]  One morning, I looked out the classroom window, and there was the health care van out there, and they were
[01:55:42.074 --> 01:55:45.195]  I'm putting all these 15 people into the van.
[01:55:45.355 --> 01:56:01.238]  The social worker, now he's a janitor, happy, has friends, has a life, has value, and here comes the van, that's how the mass murder started, was with people, folks, even people who were deaf, who had mild disabilities, were murdered.
[01:56:01.858 --> 01:56:03.858]  Absolute documented fact, please continue.
[01:56:04.319 --> 01:56:04.519]  Yes.
[01:56:05.079 --> 01:56:10.260]  So I asked the principal, what are they doing with Vincent and all those people in that van?
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:11.160]  And he said, well,
[01:56:11.761 --> 01:56:21.966]  The health department came around and asked the parents if they would like to institutionalize their sons and daughters to teach them how to read and write.
[01:56:22.126 --> 01:56:30.671]  And let me guess, I've never heard your story, let me guess, one month later they would be told that they had died of a different type of a stomach ailment.
[01:56:31.051 --> 01:56:33.332]  Normally they would declaim appendicitis rupture.
[01:56:33.352 --> 01:56:37.374]  Of course families would then freak out because many of them already had their appendixes removed.
[01:56:38.035 --> 01:56:51.479]  No, it was six months later that the letter started coming to the families from the health department that their son or daughter died a natural but merciful death.
[01:56:51.679 --> 01:56:53.640]  Now, everyone hear this and hear this now.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.021]  I have thousands of pages of documents.
[01:56:56.081 --> 01:56:57.141]  Erin Dykes is coming up.
[01:56:58.328 --> 01:57:06.272]  In my hand, the Nazi system was created by the Warburgs, by the Rothschilds, and by the Carnegies.
[01:57:06.452 --> 01:57:10.434]  It was created in Germany by the British and the U.S.
[01:57:11.315 --> 01:57:12.776]  They run things now.
[01:57:13.716 --> 01:57:15.457]  Hitler was only their test model.
[01:57:16.357 --> 01:57:21.580]  As Dr. Carroll quickly said, the British funded Hitler knowing he would destroy everything.
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:23.241]  That's how cold-blooded they are.
[01:57:23.721 --> 01:57:24.922]  They're getting ready to do it here.
[01:57:25.979 --> 01:57:29.920]  They are going to send the health department for your children and they must be dealt with.
[01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:30.661]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.461 --> 01:57:38.343]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:50.437]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.097 --> 01:57:52.138]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.879 --> 01:57:54.000]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.641 --> 01:57:55.462]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.123]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.784 --> 01:58:01.567]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.968 --> 01:58:06.052]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.896 --> 01:58:23.537]  Well, my producer, Trey Kincaid, set this great lady up for just 30 minutes.
[01:58:23.597 --> 01:58:24.437]  I appreciate him doing that.
[01:58:24.457 --> 01:58:29.098]  I want to have her back up for a full hour next week if she can do it.
[01:58:29.118 --> 01:58:30.299]  We've only got five minutes left with her.
[01:58:30.319 --> 01:58:32.059]  I've been promising to get Erin Dykes in here.
[01:58:32.759 --> 01:58:34.500]  But this worked out today, this dovetail.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:35.980]  She's getting into eugenics right now.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:45.002]  And when you read the actual letters and the millions of dollars of funding in the official news articles praising the Rockefellers funding the pre-Nazis,
[01:58:45.703 --> 01:58:52.867]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute on Anthropology, the rest of them, and funding Hitler, and then funding it and changing the names after the war.
[01:58:52.967 --> 01:58:54.048]  Oh, they continue to today.
[01:58:54.868 --> 01:58:57.890]  And it's all, they're going to use environmentalism, one-child policy.
[01:58:59.411 --> 01:59:00.752]  Folks, we're in so much trouble.
[01:59:01.592 --> 01:59:10.698]  But just condensing it down to three or four minutes left, we've got Kitty Werthmann, who grew up in Austria, 12 years old, and Hitler took over Austria, and then I guess until she was
[01:59:11.676 --> 01:59:12.616]  Well, we also had gun control.
[01:59:12.636 --> 01:59:15.817]  We were told that guns are very dangerous.
[01:59:38.089 --> 01:59:42.731]  They're unsafe, and children are playing with guns, and we had hunting accidents.
[01:59:43.551 --> 01:59:58.497]  And we also had criminals again, and the only way that you could trace a murderer by the serial number, so we should register our guns so that they can take the serial number of the gun.
[01:59:59.378 --> 02:00:01.679]  So we dutifully went to the police station.
[02:00:01.719 --> 02:00:05.240]  We thought, we don't want to have criminals again, and so
[02:00:08.104 --> 02:00:14.085]  About six months later or some time, they said it really didn't help all that much.
[02:00:14.165 --> 02:00:16.766]  We still had a lot of accidents and all.
[02:00:17.246 --> 02:00:23.927]  To really be safe, we should turn in our guns to the police station.
[02:00:24.767 --> 02:00:28.708]  And if we wouldn't do that, there was capital punishment against us.
[02:00:29.388 --> 02:00:33.188]  They already knew who had guns because we registered them.
[02:00:34.349 --> 02:00:35.909]  So we were being disarmed.
[02:00:37.688 --> 02:00:40.871]  Now, by the way, they're disarming them all over this country.
[02:00:40.911 --> 02:00:42.453]  Different cities are passing laws.
[02:00:42.773 --> 02:00:44.134]  They're suing gun manufacturers.
[02:00:44.154 --> 02:00:45.876]  We've got gun control groups on documents.
[02:00:46.256 --> 02:00:57.567]  Total gun ban is their plan, and as she said on the floor of the House, and we have the actual news article about it, it was a pro article, Sarah Brady said the object before they can have total socialism in the U.S.
[02:00:57.688 --> 02:01:02.072]  is the total disarmament of the American people, and they're training the children right now to do it at the schools.
[02:01:03.041 --> 02:01:08.063]  So I urge everybody, keep your guns and buy more guns.
[02:01:08.764 --> 02:01:25.731]  Because if we had, if we had known what happened in Austria, and we had our guns, we would have fought a bloody revolution to the last man or woman, but we had nothing left except broom handles.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:36.823]  Now let's talk about that when you join us for a full hour next week because things just got worse and worse after that point and I want Americans and British and others listening.
[02:01:36.843 --> 02:01:41.125]  Well look at England, they've taken all the guns and now they're arresting you for your speech, total police state.
[02:01:41.785 --> 02:01:43.166]  Same thing starting to happen here.
[02:01:43.526 --> 02:01:44.787]  They're not playing games.
[02:01:45.347 --> 02:01:47.129]  The Bush's, of course, funded Hitler.
[02:01:48.029 --> 02:01:50.491]  They were the top Nazi agents in the U.S.
[02:01:50.531 --> 02:01:52.092]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:01:52.572 --> 02:01:55.153]  And then I want you to, of course, parallel what the government's saying and doing.
[02:01:57.055 --> 02:01:59.496]  Again, as only someone who lived through it could.
[02:02:00.317 --> 02:02:06.601]  And again, you can get the DVD that she's on from Radio Liberty, and we'll put a link to that online.
[02:02:06.901 --> 02:02:08.842]  We'll have you on for a full hour next week, okay?
[02:02:08.862 --> 02:02:10.363]  I'm going to have my producer call you right now.
[02:02:10.923 --> 02:02:11.844]  Okay, thank you.
[02:02:12.365 --> 02:02:14.367]  Thank you so much, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:14.407 --> 02:02:16.009]  That is Kitty Werthmann.
[02:02:16.690 --> 02:02:19.713]  And when we get back, Aaron Dykes will be dovetailing with all of this.
[02:02:20.354 --> 02:02:23.538]  We're doing all this research for Endgame, and I'm like, we can't wait.
[02:02:24.219 --> 02:02:25.400]  And we can't put all this in the film.
[02:02:26.013 --> 02:02:26.633]  So this is part one.
[02:02:26.673 --> 02:02:29.215]  We're going to have Aaron back on again next week for part two.
[02:02:29.235 --> 02:02:33.657]  We're going to spend 50, roughly 50 minutes with Aaron Dyches on the other side of this break.
[02:02:33.677 --> 02:02:34.778]  He works here in the office.
[02:02:35.178 --> 02:02:37.659]  Helped do the research for the eugenics section of this film.
[02:02:37.980 --> 02:02:38.860]  We're going to go over it.
[02:02:38.940 --> 02:02:40.261]  This is what runs the whole world.
[02:02:40.561 --> 02:02:42.442]  This is their master plan, their system.
[02:02:48.777 --> 02:02:51.923]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.283 --> 02:02:54.207]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.587 --> 02:03:02.241]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.904 --> 02:03:09.966]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.366 --> 02:03:21.788]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.109 --> 02:03:25.589]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.069 --> 02:03:27.990]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.330 --> 02:03:32.171]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.296 --> 02:03:50.380]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:57.766]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:03:57.906 --> 02:04:08.555]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:04:08.755 --> 02:04:13.299]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:13.559 --> 02:04:18.541]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[02:04:18.761 --> 02:04:21.702]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:21.922 --> 02:04:31.746]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[02:04:31.806 --> 02:04:36.807]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:45.470 --> 02:04:47.970]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1,200 bucks now?
[02:04:48.510 --> 02:04:49.631]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[02:04:49.831 --> 02:04:53.972]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:04:54.582 --> 02:04:59.467]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[02:04:59.987 --> 02:05:06.393]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[02:05:07.148 --> 02:05:09.850]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:05:10.010 --> 02:05:19.977]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:05:20.257 --> 02:05:23.960]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:05:24.020 --> 02:05:25.961]  You know, power companies, government.
[02:05:26.801 --> 02:05:30.504]  Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:05:30.684 --> 02:05:31.725]  Are you ready to go solar?
[02:05:31.925 --> 02:05:32.886]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[02:05:45.116 --> 02:05:50.180]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.521 --> 02:05:52.783]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:31.307]  In the last hour, we had Kitty Worthman on, who was 12 years old when Hitler took over Austria, and she was paralleling the gun control, the national ID cards, the claiming they wanted women's rights, really to break up the family and get the women into the workforce, so the state could raise the children, and she talked about when she was like 13 years old, there was a local retarded man who was cleaning
[02:06:32.230 --> 02:06:35.861]  There's a janitor there at the little Austrian village where she lived.
[02:06:36.702 --> 02:06:40.365]  And just a van came to this tiny town and rounded up the 15 undesirables.
[02:06:40.886 --> 02:06:45.390]  Deaf people, folks that were mentally retarded, people who have good lives.
[02:06:45.790 --> 02:06:53.016]  But regardless, when you kill the least, when the government starts acting like God, things only go downhill from there.
[02:06:53.216 --> 02:06:58.661]  And it goes back to Plato, this idea of exterminating the infirm, the weak.
[02:06:59.342 --> 02:07:00.503]  It goes right through to today.
[02:07:00.523 --> 02:07:02.024]  It is the perfect ideology
[02:07:02.959 --> 02:07:09.885]  Of the elite, the emotional and psychological salve to engage in whatever mass murder or extermination of the populations they wish.
[02:07:09.945 --> 02:07:22.076]  Now this is a special, very special, you know, 40 minutes of air time in this last hour you're about to hear because we have been rocked to our very core what we've learned here.
[02:07:22.637 --> 02:07:25.499]  You know, I've seen scores of films about eugenics.
[02:07:25.799 --> 02:07:27.661]  I have read many books about it.
[02:07:27.701 --> 02:07:29.723]  I've done countless hours of research online
[02:07:30.405 --> 02:07:33.507]  And about six months ago, we've been working on Endgame now for more than a year.
[02:07:33.767 --> 02:07:39.470]  We've been working on this since the spring of 2006.
[02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:45.893]  And of course, in the summer, early summer of 2006, we traveled to Bilderberg to cover the Elite there.
[02:07:46.453 --> 02:07:52.457]  And the film, we also have footage from this year in Istanbul, and the film's going to be out in late October.
[02:07:53.337 --> 02:07:56.919]  And I said, we can't wait with this information, because about six months ago,
[02:07:57.933 --> 02:08:01.295]  I told Aaron, I said, OK, now we're getting up towards this latter half of the film.
[02:08:01.995 --> 02:08:05.257]  I need you to vet all of my facts in this script.
[02:08:05.697 --> 02:08:10.579]  I've already vetted them, but I want you to double vet, bring up any other points you want on eugenics.
[02:08:10.719 --> 02:08:16.702]  And so Aaron has spent a couple hours each day for the last six months, even in a lot of time in his off time.
[02:08:16.742 --> 02:08:18.763]  I'll show up at the office at 10 in the morning.
[02:08:19.183 --> 02:08:20.744]  He's never even left sometimes.
[02:08:21.404 --> 02:08:21.945]  I don't think so.
[02:08:36.337 --> 02:08:39.358]  That these people openly say they want to kill 80 plus percent of us.
[02:08:39.638 --> 02:08:41.499]  And when you find out they're running everything.
[02:08:41.919 --> 02:08:44.760]  And when you find out they put Hitler and Stalin and Mao in.
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:48.181]  And when you find out all these countries are carrying the shadow.
[02:08:48.201 --> 02:08:59.804]  When you find out modern environmentalism is neo-feudalism and a way to control resources and one-child policies they're now admitting under the program and under the carbon taxes that's now being announced.
[02:09:00.185 --> 02:09:01.245]  When you find it out
[02:09:02.136 --> 02:09:04.937]  This is a two-hour film we're making, and only 15 minutes.
[02:09:04.997 --> 02:09:07.178]  The end is on Eugenics and the Master Plan.
[02:09:07.599 --> 02:09:08.339]  Or about 20 minutes.
[02:09:08.359 --> 02:09:09.439]  We're trying to hold it down to two hours.
[02:09:09.459 --> 02:09:10.380]  It looks like it may go over.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:15.862]  It's like, I can't make a film that's less than two hours, though it's more effective.
[02:09:15.902 --> 02:09:18.544]  So, here is Aaron Dykes, who's got the floor.
[02:09:18.564 --> 02:09:21.325]  Aaron, I want you to just go through, take your time.
[02:09:21.345 --> 02:09:22.145]  We've got plenty of time.
[02:09:22.626 --> 02:09:23.286]  Walk through.
[02:09:23.406 --> 02:09:24.426]  You've got your notes there.
[02:09:24.446 --> 02:09:25.127]  You've got a stack.
[02:09:25.567 --> 02:09:27.528]  This stack is just the condensed stuff.
[02:09:28.266 --> 02:09:30.647]  And again, we're trying to put this into 15 minutes in the film.
[02:09:31.128 --> 02:09:35.330]  This is just the history of eugenics, and there's eugenics present, eugenics future.
[02:09:37.772 --> 02:09:39.312]  Folks, this is the biggest story.
[02:09:39.633 --> 02:09:40.933]  This is what it's all about.
[02:09:41.214 --> 02:09:43.935]  This is who the globalists think about.
[02:09:43.975 --> 02:09:45.136]  This is what they believe in.
[02:09:46.101 --> 02:09:48.363]  And you can debate who runs the New World Order and who's behind it.
[02:09:48.623 --> 02:09:51.184]  I'm telling you, I've been doing the research for 15 years.
[02:09:51.585 --> 02:09:53.266]  And I'm telling you, this is what they're into.
[02:09:53.606 --> 02:09:55.147]  This is what they go on retreats about.
[02:09:55.487 --> 02:09:57.208]  This is their religion.
[02:09:57.489 --> 02:10:01.752]  It is a religion of mass murder and death, of elitism, of total control.
[02:10:02.332 --> 02:10:05.934]  You know, you've heard of people who just want to wreck things and want to see others fall and others fail.
[02:10:06.355 --> 02:10:07.355]  This is the elite.
[02:10:07.876 --> 02:10:13.960]  They are hyper-competitive, hyper-dominant, and it's all about full control, full domination.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.781]  It's about fully controlling
[02:10:17.162 --> 02:10:22.006]  populations and never having any competition to their monopoly of power, and that's in their own words.
[02:10:22.366 --> 02:10:27.430]  We picked for this film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement, and Aaron last week goes, oh my god, H.G.
[02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:32.895]  Wells basically said the same thing, that it's this blueprint for total enslavement and how they're going to exterminate us.
[02:10:33.155 --> 02:10:39.400]  So to walk us through that is Aaron Dykes, who again is one of our video editors and the webmaster for JonesReport.com.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:43.223]  Aaron, all I can say is excellent job with the research you've done.
[02:10:43.243 --> 02:10:45.605]  You dug up a lot of stuff that I wasn't even aware of.
[02:10:46.045 --> 02:10:51.570]  And as usual, it's many times worse than even I thought, and day by day the research just gets more horrifying.
[02:10:51.610 --> 02:10:58.256]  We just uncovered, of course, letters to Hitler and all the support of it, Margaret Singer.
[02:10:58.716 --> 02:11:04.021]  We already knew she hated black people and called them weeds, but to find the documents where she's saying, we do want to kill all the blacks,
[02:11:04.501 --> 02:11:05.922]  But we can't let them discover it.
[02:11:05.962 --> 02:11:06.922]  We've got to keep it secret.
[02:11:07.162 --> 02:11:16.085]  How they bought off the black leaders then, set up welfare and the social services and the health departments to exterminate the blacks.
[02:11:16.105 --> 02:11:17.545]  They've done a very good job of that.
[02:11:18.505 --> 02:11:19.566]  My God, we have them!
[02:11:20.046 --> 02:11:23.307]  I mean, all these people need to be arrested immediately who are out there.
[02:11:23.547 --> 02:11:25.827]  I mean, folks, these are mass-martyring criminals.
[02:11:26.208 --> 02:11:27.388]  Aaron Dykes, you have the floor.
[02:11:28.090 --> 02:11:31.016]  Absolutely, and what we're talking about here again is eugenics.
[02:11:31.056 --> 02:11:37.488]  There's so many details we literally are drowning in them, but it's not a loss of forest for the trees.
[02:11:37.528 --> 02:11:40.353]  We're talking about the belief that you can
[02:11:41.690 --> 02:11:47.873]  Lift up a highly gifted race of men through breeding, and weed out the poor and the lower people.
[02:11:48.453 --> 02:11:53.195]  And, you know, I brought up sterilization to a friend, and I've been passing around words like eugenics.
[02:11:53.215 --> 02:11:59.638]  Some people on the ground don't even recognize what that is, or if you do, you're immediately associated only with the Nazis.
[02:11:59.678 --> 02:12:07.922]  But we are talking about eugenics that came through the British, rose to heights in America, and then transferred to Nazi Germany.
[02:12:10.063 --> 02:12:11.023]  You have the floor, break it down.
[02:12:12.003 --> 02:12:14.685]  So this all started with Francis Galton.
[02:12:15.186 --> 02:12:22.091]  Francis Galton was the cousin of Charles Darwin, origin of species, who developed evolution.
[02:12:22.772 --> 02:12:29.077]  And Darwin himself was very much influenced by Thomas Malthusianism.
[02:12:30.098 --> 02:12:31.299]  Let's go back to Plato first.
[02:12:32.540 --> 02:12:33.080]  Absolutely.
[02:12:33.120 --> 02:12:36.143]  Well, Plato believed that the state should control breeding.
[02:12:36.952 --> 02:12:46.656]  He believed that it was the more knowledgeable people who should control society, that democracy or republics of any kind weren't really the way to go.
[02:12:46.716 --> 02:12:50.078]  We're talking about elite breeding through science.
[02:12:51.359 --> 02:12:55.140]  And that definitely influenced a lot of the stuff we're dealing with today.
[02:12:56.141 --> 02:12:56.461]  In fact,
[02:12:57.432 --> 02:13:03.299]  You've got a lot of the quotes from Plato, and in Part 2, or if we have time later at the end of the show, you can get into some of those quotes.
[02:13:03.319 --> 02:13:04.400]  I mean, this is not our opinion.
[02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:08.204]  This is actual quotes from the Republican others, but continue walking through it.
[02:13:12.108 --> 02:13:26.075]  Not a biologist at the time that Darwin published his Origin of Species, but he was so enlightened by Darwin's idea of advancing the species through competitiveness that he changed into biology and started pursuing this.
[02:13:26.775 --> 02:13:38.060]  And not only biology, but believed that mankind could actually take hold of the reins of evolution and drive mankind's own evolution in an intelligent, designed way.
[02:13:38.080 --> 02:13:38.961]  And of course, after
[02:13:40.006 --> 02:13:44.954]  World War II, they changed the name from eugenics to transhumanism and bioethics and environmentalism.
[02:13:44.974 --> 02:13:45.595]  Please continue.
[02:13:46.676 --> 02:13:54.087]  Yeah, it gets the name changing later, but eugenics would be actually an elitist term in itself.
[02:13:54.187 --> 02:13:55.750]  It means well-born in Greek.
[02:13:56.534 --> 02:13:56.975]  I don't know.
[02:14:14.818 --> 02:14:25.680]  But the main driver of eugenics was sterilization, keeping the undesirables from breeding, and choosing wisely who to breed with in terms of elites.
[02:14:26.241 --> 02:14:39.404]  And they believed they could purify and uplift their race, which ended up being a horrible irony because most of the people in their family, which was all selected, ended up with mental diseases, had breakdowns, and had similar situations to
[02:14:42.335 --> 02:14:44.778]  People they thought shouldn't be allowed to live, basically.
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:58.694]  And that's the thing, almost all these eugenics families interbred, and so literally, we have all the documents, they ended up literally in the mental institutions with all these genetic diseases, but that didn't make them stop there, they just continued.
[02:15:00.114 --> 02:15:14.049]  No, in fact, it was Thomas H. Huxley, the grandfather of Aldous Huxley, author of Brave New World, who's familiar to almost everyone, and Thomas Huxley, also the grandfather of Julian Huxley, who later founded UNESCO.
[02:15:14.844 --> 02:15:35.095]  was not only known as Darwin's bullfrog and helped get the theory of evolution accepted into scientific society in Britain where they were, he also became a proponent of Galton's eugenics and really got that driven into the mainstream, got it into the university circles, the Royal Society of London,
[02:15:36.055 --> 02:15:41.199]  And from there, it only spread to the United States and most of Europe, actually.
[02:15:41.359 --> 02:15:56.849]  Now, it fit like a hand in glove with already the feudal views of the New World Order, of the elites that already believed in breeding, already believed they were superior, already believed they were gods compared to the commoners, already had systems to control and dumb down populations to make them more manageable.
[02:15:57.390 --> 02:15:59.111]  Manuals have been written about this all over the world.
[02:15:59.131 --> 02:16:03.454]  That's why it was very popular by then, by the turn of the last century, in Mexico, in Japan,
[02:16:04.134 --> 02:16:05.215]  Then exported to Germany.
[02:16:05.856 --> 02:16:08.799]  Let's run right through the events here.
[02:16:09.660 --> 02:16:10.220]  Well, that's right.
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:16.006]  We're not just talking about usurping and taking control of dominating people.
[02:16:16.166 --> 02:16:23.053]  It's the scientific belief that you have a justification and it gets really nasty.
[02:16:23.073 --> 02:16:25.195]  Well, it's their rationalization to do whatever they want.
[02:16:26.156 --> 02:16:26.697]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:16:28.035 --> 02:16:32.056]  And specifically, we're talking about starting in the United States in 1896.
[02:16:32.956 --> 02:16:44.179]  Connecticut passed the first eugenical law applying to marriage where the epileptic, imbeciles, so-called feeble-minded could not marry by law.
[02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:55.082]  You know, I know I just thought to do this a few days ago, but we should have played the clip from that film about, you know, where they show the judge saying you're not allowed to marry because your family's criminals.
[02:16:56.195 --> 02:16:56.795]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:16:57.236 --> 02:17:01.538]  The famous quote in the film is, three generations of imbeciles are enough.
[02:17:02.339 --> 02:17:11.064]  A justification in the Supreme Court upholding a eugenical law that you can forcibly sterilize people, and that's one of the components we're talking about.
[02:17:11.104 --> 02:17:12.325]  That was Oliver Wendell Holmes.
[02:17:12.505 --> 02:17:13.826]  Oliver Wendell Holmes, that's right.
[02:17:13.846 --> 02:17:13.826]  1927.
[02:17:14.266 --> 02:17:22.331]  Now, we're talking about people, folks, this is bad to do to anybody, but folks who had below a
[02:17:24.875 --> 02:17:26.937]  B-plus would be sterilized.
[02:17:27.838 --> 02:17:31.262]  And, of course, then it led to people actually being killed.
[02:17:31.322 --> 02:17:32.383]  Stay there, Aaron Dykes.
[02:17:33.324 --> 02:17:42.934]  When we get back, we're going to go straight into the golden age of eugenics leading to Hitler, and now how they've repackaged it and renamed it.
[02:17:42.954 --> 02:17:43.355]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.675 --> 02:17:53.938]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:54.178 --> 02:17:58.539]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:58.839 --> 02:18:07.742]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:07.962 --> 02:18:11.583]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:11.863 --> 02:18:16.891]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:17.191 --> 02:18:23.902]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:24.406 --> 02:18:25.067]  What about you?
[02:18:25.708 --> 02:18:31.054]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:19:18.194 --> 02:19:19.255]  Erosion accelerates.
[02:19:19.436 --> 02:19:21.998]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[02:19:22.158 --> 02:19:24.059]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[02:19:24.240 --> 02:19:26.762]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[02:19:26.962 --> 02:19:27.903]  Why attack Iran?
[02:19:28.023 --> 02:19:31.025]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.

[02:20:01.451 --> 02:20:05.156]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:20:05.437 --> 02:20:08.101]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:20:08.721 --> 02:20:13.028]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:20:13.228 --> 02:20:17.474]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:20:17.894 --> 02:20:22.237]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[02:20:48.798 --> 02:20:53.742]  Are radical Islamic nations seeking to gain control of the Security Council of the United Nations?
[02:20:54.423 --> 02:20:56.224]  What would be their purpose for doing so?

[02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:22.516]  Did you know that the prophecies of the Bible are far in advance of today's news?
[02:21:23.116 --> 02:21:26.337]  It discusses a coming economic system called the Mark of the Beast.

[02:21:33.258 --> 02:21:33.418]  Call now.
[02:21:52.317 --> 02:21:53.658]  Look out your window, baby.
[02:21:53.899 --> 02:21:55.340]  There's a scene you'd like to catch.
[02:21:56.941 --> 02:22:06.530]  Alright, Aaron Dyches.
[02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:10.813]  Again, we've been doing research for the film Endgame.
[02:22:10.833 --> 02:22:13.476]  We've discovered that things were even worse than we thought.
[02:22:13.836 --> 02:22:15.878]  Not only is eugenics a dominant thread,
[02:22:16.912 --> 02:22:19.913]  It is a guiding force in everything the New World Order does.
[02:22:21.014 --> 02:22:32.138]  We've gotten up to turn of the century with these top scientists in England who are already into this classism and elitism, really codifying things into social Darwinism.
[02:22:32.178 --> 02:22:36.499]  It's their right to rule, their right to dominate, their right to be abusive, their right to kill!
[02:22:37.019 --> 02:22:39.760]  Because just like an ant species, they do these parallel studies.
[02:22:40.441 --> 02:22:42.221]  We're just helping everyone killing them.
[02:22:42.941 --> 02:22:44.242]  Let us continue, please.
[02:22:44.562 --> 02:22:44.942]  That's right.
[02:22:44.982 --> 02:22:48.446]  We're talking about eugenics, the worst part of Nazi Germany.
[02:22:48.866 --> 02:22:53.871]  The belief that you can eradicate people who don't fit into the society you want to have.
[02:22:54.311 --> 02:22:58.475]  And we're talking about eugenics in Nazi that didn't develop from Hitler.
[02:22:58.855 --> 02:23:01.037]  They developed from British social theory.
[02:23:01.398 --> 02:23:04.581]  They developed from laboratories in the United States.
[02:23:05.545 --> 02:23:13.188]  And we have the quotes in my comp, my struggle, Adolf Hitler 1924, where he thanks the eugenicists, where he thanks... But you know what?
[02:23:13.208 --> 02:23:13.969]  I know you're skipping ahead.
[02:23:13.989 --> 02:23:16.430]  It's just so much info, I start jumping in.
[02:23:16.510 --> 02:23:17.090]  Go through it, Aaron.
[02:23:18.200 --> 02:23:18.821]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:23:18.841 --> 02:23:20.703]  We're talking about Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[02:23:20.723 --> 02:23:26.429]  He praised all the top eugenicists from America, which started basically at the turn of the 20th century.
[02:23:27.690 --> 02:23:40.123]  In 1898, Charles B. Davenport, one of the key directors of American eugenics, started the Cold Springs Harbor Research Station, which was directly funded by the Carnegie Institute.
[02:23:40.763 --> 02:24:00.792]  And by 1910 they had opened the eugenics record office that cataloged and traced heredity, hair samples, physical traits, which was again funded by the Carnegies, by the Harrimans, by the Rockefellers, and the Rockefellers ended up setting up the institutions in Germany that led to Nazi eugenics.
[02:24:01.052 --> 02:24:09.476]  And that's the Kaiser Wilhelm School of Anthropology, and then ARMS in the US, ARMS in Europe, they bankrolled it all.
[02:24:10.157 --> 02:24:10.597]  That's right.
[02:24:10.657 --> 02:24:13.118]  It spread from America into Germany.
[02:24:13.178 --> 02:24:15.478]  They loved so much the eugenics that was happening.
[02:24:16.098 --> 02:24:25.600]  And the Rockefeller started funding the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute starting about 1910, which became fully blossomed in the late 20s.
[02:24:25.660 --> 02:24:29.641]  Then we have, now there's this key global conference in London.
[02:24:29.921 --> 02:24:31.621]  That's when it hit superstar level.
[02:24:32.001 --> 02:24:34.062]  All over the newspapers, everyone's into it.
[02:24:34.302 --> 02:24:35.622]  They had contests all about it.
[02:24:36.149 --> 02:24:53.295]  That's right, it was 1912 in London, and this is when eugenics was no longer just social theory amongst British elites, but something that was taking place in Sweden, Norway, Australia, most if not all of Western Europe, and we have maps of this that's all up, we're not just
[02:24:53.655 --> 02:25:13.571]  I'm talking here, but it went supernova in America, largely because of this Cold Springs Harbor Research Station and the way they were able to legitimize this not only among society people, including former presidents Teddy Roosevelt, Herbert Hoover, and many more actually, but amongst common people.
[02:25:13.631 --> 02:25:17.434]  They would have fitter family contests at state fairs.
[02:25:17.494 --> 02:25:20.056]  They would have most beautiful baby contests.
[02:25:20.496 --> 02:25:26.160]  Where you would go through a eugenics process and they would vet you out and say, you have a goodly heritage.
[02:25:26.180 --> 02:25:29.883]  They have all this propaganda too, where it's spread only good seed.
[02:25:29.903 --> 02:25:31.303]  You have a goodly heritage.
[02:25:32.044 --> 02:25:39.509]  And they would reward ordinary people for having a goodly heritage, if you will, and the most beautiful baby.
[02:25:39.529 --> 02:25:41.550]  And they have these contests at churches too.
[02:25:42.371 --> 02:25:42.851]  That's right.
[02:25:42.891 --> 02:25:44.332]  Yeah, it's spread to churches too.
[02:25:45.934 --> 02:25:51.058]  A contest to see who could integrate eugenics best into their sermons.
[02:25:51.158 --> 02:25:58.683]  Which they have now for environmentalism and the global warming, which again, we have the actual documents, is nothing but a global eugenics policy.
[02:25:59.043 --> 02:26:01.885]  Actual war against humanity, nothing to do with the earth.
[02:26:02.185 --> 02:26:03.226]  Hold on just a second.
[02:26:03.326 --> 02:26:10.851]  Regarding the eugenics and religion, we have Alfred Edward Wiggum, and he wrote the New Decalogue of Science.
[02:26:10.911 --> 02:26:11.432]  He was a
[02:26:12.188 --> 02:26:23.538]  Presbyterian, Protestant preacher, and he believed eugenics fit in quite well with Christianity, and even said if Jesus were among us here today, he would be the president of the Eugenic Society.
[02:26:23.558 --> 02:26:24.839]  Now let's be clear, folks.
[02:26:24.899 --> 02:26:27.161]  You're being told the key, the big secret.
[02:26:27.521 --> 02:26:30.764]  We have Margaret Sanger calling black people worthless, saying they must all be slaughtered.
[02:26:31.385 --> 02:26:32.726]  Most of the whites must be slaughtered.
[02:26:32.786 --> 02:26:33.787]  Everyone must be slaughtered.
[02:26:34.107 --> 02:26:35.788]  This is the ultimate enemy.
[02:26:35.848 --> 02:26:36.749]  They run everything.
[02:26:37.089 --> 02:26:37.650]  Please continue.
[02:26:38.607 --> 02:26:39.187]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:26:39.267 --> 02:26:52.090]  Eugenics is not only accepted and promoted as an idea, this guy Alfred E. Wiggum calls eugenics the duty, the first commandment of the new decalogue of science.
[02:26:52.991 --> 02:27:02.513]  The first commandment, and these are captains of science, captains of industry being bankrolled by the Carnegies, by the Rothschilds, by the Rockefellers, by all the big power brokers.
[02:27:03.129 --> 02:27:09.573]  That's right, and these academic minds legitimize it to the point where eugenics was not only acceptable, but the duty of man.
[02:27:10.013 --> 02:27:11.674]  It was something we were meant to promote.
[02:27:11.874 --> 02:27:19.879]  It is the way we uplift our species, and the poverty and degradation and bringing down of the species is our detriment.
[02:27:19.939 --> 02:27:21.200]  We've got to get rid of those people.
[02:27:21.460 --> 02:27:22.801]  Now, don't believe me?
[02:27:22.821 --> 02:27:23.682]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:27:23.702 --> 02:27:25.903]  Type in social worker into Google.
[02:27:25.943 --> 02:27:26.543]  Get the history.
[02:27:26.864 --> 02:27:30.906]  We're set up as cores to go out and take children and kill them and sterilize them.
[02:27:31.447 --> 02:27:32.007]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.881 --> 02:27:38.887]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.809 --> 02:27:42.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.503 --> 02:27:46.903]  Attention!

[02:28:03.849 --> 02:28:12.592]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:28:13.012 --> 02:28:13.192]  Yeah.
[02:28:13.212 --> 02:28:18.435]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[02:28:18.715 --> 02:28:28.179]  However, it is still legal to own this compound and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.

[02:30:53.650 --> 02:30:55.912]  You heard Rothschild in the first hour.
[02:30:56.792 --> 02:30:58.634]  Talk to us like we were stupid children.
[02:30:59.555 --> 02:31:01.036]  Talk to us like we were dumb.
[02:31:01.696 --> 02:31:03.377]  Like we couldn't figure out what they were doing.
[02:31:04.298 --> 02:31:06.800]  Well I tell him, he may be able to fool a lot of people.
[02:31:08.261 --> 02:31:12.785]  And his propaganda, and his family's propaganda, the New Orleans propaganda may work on some people.
[02:31:13.545 --> 02:31:15.106]  But it isn't working on everybody.
[02:31:16.027 --> 02:31:16.908]  And they are gonna fail.
[02:31:17.888 --> 02:31:18.969]  We don't have a choice.
[02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:21.111]  This is make it or break it right now.
[02:31:21.756 --> 02:31:25.940]  They're putting in their control grid right now, so they can exterminate us en masse.
[02:31:26.501 --> 02:31:27.341]  They mean to do it.
[02:31:28.062 --> 02:31:28.903]  We've got the proof.
[02:31:29.523 --> 02:31:34.928]  These people are the most selfish, wicked individuals you could ever imagine, and we must stand against them.
[02:31:37.291 --> 02:31:39.533]  We're gonna go back to Aaron Dykes here in just a moment.
[02:31:39.613 --> 02:31:45.878]  I hope that all of you will take advantage of this great offer from Solutions from Science and Thomas, Illinois at blacklist.urb.com.
[02:31:47.368 --> 02:31:49.310]  Uh, they will send it out to you with just an invoice.
[02:31:49.350 --> 02:31:50.451]  No credit card number needed.
[02:31:50.531 --> 02:31:50.912]  No nothing.
[02:31:50.932 --> 02:31:55.936]  They'll just send you an invoice for the bottle of Shilocene that they're going to send you.
[02:31:56.036 --> 02:31:59.139]  It is 84 different types of minerals in ionic form.
[02:31:59.619 --> 02:32:00.520]  I research this stuff.
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:01.341]  Really good stuff.
[02:32:01.781 --> 02:32:04.804]  Minerals deficiency is one of the biggest problems people face.
[02:32:05.365 --> 02:32:06.145]  It's a great company.
[02:32:06.185 --> 02:32:06.746]  Great products.
[02:32:06.786 --> 02:32:08.087]  Blacklistedherb.com.

[02:32:11.550 --> 02:32:12.231]  You just call them up.
[02:32:12.951 --> 02:32:15.873]  And they send you the invoice and it's a three month supply in one bottle.
[02:32:16.333 --> 02:32:25.859]  If you like it, if you think it has good effects for your health and for your nutrition, then pay the old invoice and get a new bottle in three months.
[02:32:26.059 --> 02:32:28.400]  Give them a call at 877-327-0365 or blacklistedherb.com.
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:30.661]  And yes, if you believe in what we're doing,
[02:32:39.648 --> 02:32:42.931]  I mean, frankly, we're the hardest working folks in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:32:44.853 --> 02:32:46.034]  I wish that wasn't the case.
[02:32:46.254 --> 02:32:48.696]  I wish that it wasn't us here having to do this.
[02:32:49.477 --> 02:32:57.304]  I mean, literally, I was burning with passion today driving into the office, thinking about all the documents I've read, thinking about all the books I've read.
[02:32:57.344 --> 02:32:59.526]  We order books written by these people.
[02:32:59.546 --> 02:33:01.188]  It's not like we even believe stuff on the Internet.
[02:33:02.683 --> 02:33:06.004]  You hope Margaret Sanger didn't say it and you get the source.
[02:33:06.024 --> 02:33:09.485]  You hope Prince Bernhardt didn't say it and you get the book.
[02:33:09.585 --> 02:33:16.268]  You hope the UN document that you read about isn't true and you order the UN document and it's real.
[02:33:16.328 --> 02:33:17.048]  Believe me, folks.
[02:33:17.988 --> 02:33:22.774]  And I was just burning with desire driving into the office this morning, going, I wish I could articulate.
[02:33:22.834 --> 02:33:23.955]  I wish I was man enough.
[02:33:24.095 --> 02:33:25.256]  I wish I had the intellect.
[02:33:25.677 --> 02:33:34.447]  And I literally started praying, saying, God, please, whatever the cost may be, help me have the intellect, be able to articulate how serious this is.
[02:33:35.528 --> 02:33:40.191]  Please don't let the devolver kill me yet or hurt my family yet because it's not that I'm being selfish.
[02:33:40.251 --> 02:33:43.733]  It's that I, if I ask for anything, it's more time to fight these people.
[02:33:44.073 --> 02:33:45.094]  I want to beat them.
[02:33:45.194 --> 02:33:46.335]  I want to take them down.
[02:33:46.755 --> 02:33:47.956]  I want to put them in prison.
[02:33:48.556 --> 02:33:51.878]  I mean, they openly kill people in mass all over the world.
[02:33:52.159 --> 02:33:55.121]  They openly sit around and brag about it and laugh at us.
[02:33:55.961 --> 02:34:00.904]  And then we got to watch them on TV and radio and in print acting like our saviors continually.
[02:34:01.045 --> 02:34:02.385]  I can't stand it.
[02:34:03.366 --> 02:34:04.407]  I don't like it.
[02:34:07.302 --> 02:34:09.267]  Now, please get our videos.
[02:34:09.408 --> 02:34:10.370]  Please support us.
[02:34:10.711 --> 02:34:13.377]  All I want is to fight them and to have victory against them.
[02:34:13.778 --> 02:34:14.340]  All I want.
[02:34:15.811 --> 02:34:17.332]  is to expose these murdering criminals.
[02:34:17.472 --> 02:34:23.556]  And I'm asking you right now, ladies and gentlemen, to go to InfoWars.com and order the videos.
[02:34:23.716 --> 02:34:30.901]  The Loose Change 2nd Edition, Terror Storm, Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, Riddles in Stone, the Police Fate Trilogy.
[02:34:30.961 --> 02:34:31.341]  Get them!
[02:34:31.701 --> 02:34:32.902]  Make copies of my films.
[02:34:32.942 --> 02:34:36.824]  Make copies of the other films we carry, like America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:34:37.385 --> 02:34:38.665]  Get them out to people.
[02:34:39.186 --> 02:34:40.847]  This is what we're asking you.
[02:34:41.547 --> 02:34:42.488]  We're begging you.
[02:34:43.334 --> 02:34:45.015]  I mean, we put them out for free on Google Video.
[02:34:45.075 --> 02:34:47.576]  It's not the best quality, but download those!
[02:34:47.656 --> 02:34:48.316]  Burn them to disk.
[02:34:48.396 --> 02:34:51.858]  Or get a PrisonPlanet.TV membership for 15 cents a day.
[02:34:51.878 --> 02:34:53.278]  $5.95 a month.
[02:34:53.298 --> 02:34:54.499]  The cost of 3 cups of coffee.
[02:34:54.519 --> 02:34:56.359]  3 cups of coffee!
[02:34:57.380 --> 02:35:00.061]  And it's high quality downloads there now.
[02:35:00.161 --> 02:35:01.181]  Really looks good.
[02:35:01.562 --> 02:35:02.442]  Burn them to disk.
[02:35:04.972 --> 02:35:16.561]  By the way, by next Wednesday, Terror Storm 2nd Edition will be up on the website for you by next Wednesday in high quality so you can start getting it out to folks and it's going to start shipping next week too.
[02:35:16.601 --> 02:35:20.263]  We've got it in stock and we're going to start shipping Terror Storm 2nd Edition out to you.
[02:35:20.283 --> 02:35:22.845]  So please get it as well at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:35:22.885 --> 02:35:23.086]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:35:33.326 --> 02:35:38.669]  I just know that if everyone of you listening, instead of counting on the people out there that do take action, we've had great effect because of them.
[02:35:39.710 --> 02:35:51.798]  If you just get the videos and buy a DVD burner and start aggressively, I mean go out to the mega mall or the Fry's or the electronics place today and buy a DVD side-by-side burner and buy 500 blanks.
[02:35:53.467 --> 02:35:54.207]  I mean, they're cheap now.
[02:35:54.267 --> 02:35:55.628]  And just say, that's it.
[02:35:55.668 --> 02:35:57.209]  I'm going to make a copy when I go to work in the morning.
[02:35:57.229 --> 02:35:58.090]  It takes a few minutes.
[02:35:58.110 --> 02:36:00.271]  I'll make a couple when I'm watching TV or surfing the internet.
[02:36:00.711 --> 02:36:01.791]  And just start giving them to people.
[02:36:01.831 --> 02:36:05.674]  And just literally know that Rothschild is scared.
[02:36:06.314 --> 02:36:07.955]  I heard you heard that punk in the first hour.
[02:36:08.295 --> 02:36:10.296]  Know that Rockefellers know we're coming for them.
[02:36:10.636 --> 02:36:12.217]  Know the New World Order knows we're coming for them.
[02:36:12.277 --> 02:36:16.359]  And that the blacks and whites and Hispanics and Asians and all of us can see the big picture.
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:18.260]  And just stop fighting with each other.
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:19.521]  Because I was watching Khalid Mohammed.
[02:36:20.214 --> 02:36:32.712]  You know, God rest his soul now, and I could... So much of what he said I agreed with, so much of what he said I disagreed with, because then he knows there's a new world order, he knows whites have done horrible things to blacks, and his answer is to act like the new world order and say, let's kill all the whites then.
[02:36:34.341 --> 02:36:38.443]  You know what, when I see black children being murdered in Africa, my heart literally bleeds.
[02:36:38.803 --> 02:36:48.767]  When I see Hispanic children in Mexico City, one-third of them being born without brains, with a syndrome because of the heavy metals in the air and the dirt, I literally, my heart literally bleeds for them.
[02:36:49.227 --> 02:36:55.689]  When I watched children starving to death on all black and white films under Mao Zedong last night, it literally tore my guts out.
[02:36:56.050 --> 02:36:58.050]  I love those children as much as I love my own children.
[02:36:58.310 --> 02:36:59.111]  It's called empathy.
[02:36:59.851 --> 02:37:00.991]  Whites are not devils.
[02:37:01.072 --> 02:37:02.132]  We do not want to kill you.
[02:37:03.297 --> 02:37:05.418]  Are there evil elites that happen to be white?
[02:37:05.478 --> 02:37:10.021]  Yes, but the Chinese and Japanese love it, and there are madmen in Africa who love the New World Order.
[02:37:10.301 --> 02:37:18.006]  There were blacks who worked with Margaret Sanger to kill the blacks, and thought they were going to create a super race of blacks.
[02:37:18.126 --> 02:37:20.588]  I mean, this is just, it's evil, it's wrong.
[02:37:20.988 --> 02:37:21.809]  Stand with us.
[02:37:21.829 --> 02:37:25.611]  We'll just come together against the New World Order and national sovereignty.
[02:37:26.071 --> 02:37:27.612]  We can prevail together.
[02:37:27.632 --> 02:37:28.913]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[02:37:29.955 --> 02:37:31.015]  We've got 20 minutes left.
[02:37:31.115 --> 02:37:33.556]  Aaron, let's continue with the regions of the country.
[02:37:33.596 --> 02:37:34.177]  Let's continue.
[02:37:34.197 --> 02:37:43.860]  We've gotten up to the Rockefellers being thanked in Mein Kampf, the eugenicists being thanked by Adolf Hitler.
[02:37:44.341 --> 02:37:45.221]  Please continue, hurry.
[02:37:45.908 --> 02:37:51.570]  Alex, we're talking about sterilization and how did it get to Nazi Germany from the United States.
[02:37:51.690 --> 02:38:01.713]  Not only the fact that the Rockefeller family, the Carnegie's, the Harriman's, and many others funded eugenics and got it to Germany, but the way it came from the United States.
[02:38:01.773 --> 02:38:12.036]  The first sterilization laws passed in Indiana in 1907 and through the eugenics records office with Charles B. Davenport and Harry Laughlin looked them up.
[02:38:12.863 --> 02:38:16.136]  We got 30 states in the United States by 1935.
[02:38:18.260 --> 02:38:19.920]  With sterilization laws.
[02:38:20.361 --> 02:38:21.461]  One repealed in Nevada.
[02:38:21.481 --> 02:38:23.321]  I guess they didn't think it was such a great idea.
[02:38:23.762 --> 02:38:26.162]  And seven other states with laws pending.
[02:38:26.182 --> 02:38:28.803]  Now, here's the key.
[02:38:29.243 --> 02:38:35.385]  Under federal funding, hundreds of millions of dollars, we have all the documents, funded to set up health departments.
[02:38:35.425 --> 02:38:36.745]  That's what they were first set up for.
[02:38:37.165 --> 02:38:39.926]  Racial hygiene was the term we coined.
[02:38:40.166 --> 02:38:43.867]  Then the Nazis picked up racial hygiene and they would go around
[02:38:44.790 --> 02:38:52.113]  Alex, it's bad enough to believe you're going to purify your race by selectively breeding with other elites, and this is some cow going to breed literally a super smart race of men, which is what
[02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:14.402]  Not only Galton, but later HG Wells and a number of other top people.
[02:39:14.622 --> 02:39:15.863]  And really it creates mental patients.
[02:39:16.303 --> 02:39:16.864]  Yes it does.
[02:39:17.444 --> 02:39:20.666]  But there's also negative eugenics, which is sterilization.
[02:39:20.686 --> 02:39:22.167]  It is child... I'm sorry...
[02:39:26.283 --> 02:39:36.436]  We're talking about sterilization, we're talking about wiping people out, birth control, abortion, and some of these people believed in just altogether killing these people.
[02:39:36.456 --> 02:39:41.342]  In fact, we've got quotes by American, British, and German eugenicists just saying, we need to just start killing.
[02:39:42.208 --> 02:39:44.489]  In fact, Leiter, if you're during the break, you can actually dig those quotes up.
[02:39:44.989 --> 02:39:45.689]  Keep going, take your time.
[02:39:45.929 --> 02:39:46.909]  That's right, that's right.
[02:39:46.949 --> 02:39:58.012]  The Eugenics Records Office, which was the mainstream office funded by the Carnegie's, again, Davenport, Laughlin, and then their number three guy, Madison Grant, favored extermination.
[02:39:58.052 --> 02:40:00.793]  They thought he was a little extreme, but he was allowed to stay in the club.
[02:40:01.213 --> 02:40:03.353]  Hitler later didn't think that was so extreme.
[02:40:03.673 --> 02:40:04.594]  And that's literal, too.
[02:40:04.634 --> 02:40:05.674]  That is not a euphemism.
[02:40:05.694 --> 02:40:10.236]  Now again, Dr. Bianchi at UT who said he wants 90% to die and it's a good thing and needs to start.
[02:40:10.536 --> 02:40:13.377]  We found his graduate student paper saying, well, he's a liberal.
[02:40:13.437 --> 02:40:14.517]  We're for killing everyone.
[02:40:14.837 --> 02:40:15.878]  All humans must die.
[02:40:16.198 --> 02:40:16.378]  All.
[02:40:16.458 --> 02:40:17.178]  Total extinction.
[02:40:17.798 --> 02:40:24.201]  Yeah, this is something that's been through the extreme Nazis, it's been through the extreme socialists, it's been worldwide.
[02:40:24.221 --> 02:40:26.221]  And it's back with a green paint job right now.
[02:40:26.842 --> 02:40:27.522]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:40:28.559 --> 02:40:31.880]  Yeah, so we are talking about the Eugenics Records Office.
[02:40:32.540 --> 02:40:40.483]  Harry Laughlin, Davenport, these directors went to Germany, met with the heads of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, met with Hitler.
[02:40:40.523 --> 02:40:41.344]  We have pictures.
[02:40:41.384 --> 02:40:43.584]  These aren't just quotes I've found on the internet.
[02:40:43.885 --> 02:40:45.365]  These aren't just books I've ordered.
[02:40:45.445 --> 02:40:46.826]  The head of IBM was in on it.
[02:40:46.866 --> 02:40:51.127]  That's why they made the first computers were the Chronicle people with the tattoo numbers.
[02:40:51.167 --> 02:40:53.068]  They're now running the national ID system today.
[02:40:53.709 --> 02:40:59.015]  That's right, it's biometrics, it's eugenics, it's all integrated to literally control the population.
[02:40:59.055 --> 02:41:06.043]  I believe when you control the breeding, you can have your elite race of men, you can have your workers, very much like in Brave New World.
[02:41:06.103 --> 02:41:10.307]  But the key is controlling that breeding, controlling that society completely.
[02:41:10.327 --> 02:41:12.630]  It was any kind of extreme government.
[02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:14.911]  It wasn't going to work to have limited government.
[02:41:15.171 --> 02:41:16.572]  You had to have selective breeding.
[02:41:16.652 --> 02:41:20.834]  So, extreme world government, socialism works, Nazis could work.
[02:41:21.294 --> 02:41:21.934]  It doesn't matter.
[02:41:21.954 --> 02:41:27.577]  And by the way, the Indian Command and Control, again, the Soviets picked it up, the Communist Chinese picked it up.
[02:41:28.097 --> 02:41:29.338]  I mean, this thing has been picked up.
[02:41:29.358 --> 02:41:30.418]  The Japanese loved it.
[02:41:30.678 --> 02:41:31.779]  The Mexicans loved it.
[02:41:31.819 --> 02:41:32.399]  Please continue.
[02:41:32.839 --> 02:41:42.201]  Yeah, I have actual documents, scans, not just quotes, of Teddy Roosevelt signing off on eugenics and how he thought it was a pretty good idea.
[02:41:42.281 --> 02:41:55.484]  We have pictures of these Davenport and other directors in Germany, writing letters back and forth to them, between the Darwins, between the Huxleys, between Hitler, and they really got things going with the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute.
[02:41:55.825 --> 02:42:01.506]  Things really picked up in 1927, which was when things were at the height in the United States
[02:42:01.966 --> 02:42:13.935]  All these states had sterilization laws, and then in 1933, Hitler comes to power, and one of his first acts is to pass that German sterilization law in pursuit of the super Nazi raid.
[02:42:13.975 --> 02:42:25.863]  And that's how the mass murder started, was first it was the retarded, it was the handicapped, and then it was, oh, you're deaf, we're taking you, and they would take you to a special center, and within one month to six months, it was always appendicitis.
[02:42:25.883 --> 02:42:26.603]  It was a big joke.
[02:42:26.964 --> 02:42:28.605]  Oh, your son or daughter died of appendicitis.
[02:42:29.045 --> 02:42:35.288]  Now, some families are so evil, if Nazis had children that had problems, they would just immediately ask them to come by and kill them.
[02:42:36.149 --> 02:42:45.654]  Now, of course, most people are pretty familiar with the Nazi regime and all the horrible things they do, but what you may or may not realize is afterwards, the aftermath
[02:42:46.292 --> 02:42:46.772]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:43:03.686 --> 02:43:04.206]  We're good to go.
[02:43:24.665 --> 02:43:27.627]  He was not prosecuted in the Nuremberg trials.
[02:43:27.787 --> 02:43:28.728]  He was allowed to continue.
[02:43:28.868 --> 02:43:34.912]  He was allowed to continue under a different name, not his own name, but eugenics was no longer eugenics.
[02:43:34.952 --> 02:43:37.194]  It became the pursuit of population control.
[02:43:37.694 --> 02:43:39.515]  It became transhumanism.
[02:43:40.176 --> 02:43:41.797]  And they wrote papers on this.
[02:43:41.837 --> 02:43:45.299]  They said, that's why Julian Huxley, in fact, where's my book?
[02:43:45.339 --> 02:43:47.721]  I have the quote in there, but we have the actual place where he wrote it.
[02:43:48.241 --> 02:43:53.204]  He says, well, it's terrible to say that we've got to continue eugenics, but it's even worse not to say it.
[02:43:54.381 --> 02:43:55.423]  We've got to continue it.
[02:43:55.443 --> 02:44:02.294]  In fact, let me just find this here for people with a Julian Huxley actual quote here for people.
[02:44:03.628 --> 02:44:05.869]  Well, they're openly talking about the things they're going to do to us.
[02:44:06.409 --> 02:44:07.889]  There's Mao Zedong.
[02:44:07.909 --> 02:44:13.071]  Now he's good, according to the... Here's Sir Julian Huxley, First Director General of UNESCO.
[02:44:13.091 --> 02:44:16.632]  This is what Bush signed back onto, runs our school curricula, everything.
[02:44:17.032 --> 02:44:31.757]  Even though it is quite true that any radical eugenics policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important for UNESCO to see to it that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and the public mind is informed of the issues at stake
[02:44:32.077 --> 02:44:34.682]  So that much that is now unthinkable may at least become thinkable.
[02:44:35.103 --> 02:44:38.670]  And see under the social welfare, under these systems, what did...
[02:44:39.543 --> 02:44:51.510]  The head doctor for the state of Texas, say, last year in the AP, when Dr. Breeding was down there debating him, he said, oh yeah, Dr. Breeding said, why are over two-thirds of the foster children in Texas on psychotropic drugs?
[02:44:51.850 --> 02:44:53.831]  And he said, because they're genetically inferior.
[02:44:54.431 --> 02:44:55.692]  And Breeding said, what's the test?
[02:44:55.732 --> 02:44:58.654]  And how do you know these drugs are for genetically inferior children?
[02:44:58.694 --> 02:44:59.774]  It's just made up.
[02:45:00.575 --> 02:45:08.059]  We give kids toxic drugs because they don't like being torn away from their parents when they cry, because you take a five-year-old or a three-year-old or a two-year-old, they call that mental illness.
[02:45:08.819 --> 02:45:19.184]  Then they drug in 90 plus percent of the cases and then you start having health problems They drug you even more they're actually and then they take little kids and test pesticides on them I mean you cannot make this stuff up.
[02:45:19.424 --> 02:45:30.269]  It's going on everywhere I have the textbook the University of Texas uses for its social workers where it calls the family a disease Okay, these these pieces of trash are doing this right now.
[02:45:30.869 --> 02:45:34.931]  Please continue Alex that quote from Huxley is key.
[02:45:35.391 --> 02:45:36.692]  What is not possible now is
[02:45:38.081 --> 02:45:45.607]  What is not thinkable now, eugenics, we want to at least talk about so it becomes at least thinkable, so eugenics can become possible again.
[02:45:46.028 --> 02:45:51.212]  That quote came from 1947, only a couple years after the end of World War II.
[02:45:52.193 --> 02:45:54.455]  Julian Huxley founded UNESCO in 1946.
[02:45:56.336 --> 02:46:00.539]  Uh, cast off everything the Nazis did and continued in population control.
[02:46:00.559 --> 02:46:08.404]  And if you know the first thing about UNESCO, you know what they've done in Africa, and other third world nations, sterilizing people, and so forth.
[02:46:26.416 --> 02:46:28.537]  And then he goes, but I love black children.
[02:46:28.557 --> 02:46:30.438]  I have special injections.
[02:46:31.278 --> 02:46:35.119]  And then, oh, we wonder why all these countries have half AIDS rates and everyone's sterilized.
[02:46:35.139 --> 02:46:44.443]  And hundreds of different vaccine makers, they found a very expensive added female hormone bound to the tetanus pathogen, which then sterilizes the woman, creates an autoimmune response.
[02:46:44.483 --> 02:46:45.183]  I mean, these sons of...
[02:46:47.325 --> 02:46:48.527]  None of us are safe!
[02:46:48.607 --> 02:46:49.488]  We're in danger!
[02:46:49.508 --> 02:46:51.311]  It's just like the end of the Body Snatchers movie, folks!
[02:46:51.511 --> 02:46:53.454]  I could be running around the street stopping cars!
[02:46:53.674 --> 02:46:55.577]  We all should be just going crazy right now!
[02:46:55.617 --> 02:46:56.398]  This is insane!
[02:46:56.578 --> 02:46:57.479]  They run everything!
[02:46:57.499 --> 02:46:59.962]  They've got nukes, weapons, the police, everything!
[02:47:00.003 --> 02:47:00.844]  They run everything!
[02:47:01.613 --> 02:47:05.095]  And this is where Act II of eugenics really picks up.
[02:47:05.475 --> 02:47:07.516]  We all know what happened in Nazi Germany.
[02:47:07.877 --> 02:47:11.279]  We all hated it, and we excised it, and eugenics was dead.
[02:47:11.699 --> 02:47:13.640]  No, world government continued.
[02:47:13.680 --> 02:47:16.161]  The Fabian sect of eugenics continued.
[02:47:16.442 --> 02:47:22.785]  The American Eugenics Society, founded in 22, continued, did not end after the war.
[02:47:23.266 --> 02:47:30.610]  It's still in place today, however, in 1972 it changed its name to the Society for the Study of Social Biology.
[02:47:31.150 --> 02:47:35.554]  A more tame name, but the American Eugenics Society... And they push for population reduction numbers.
[02:47:35.874 --> 02:47:42.519]  And I want to tell Bianca and the trash that met a few weeks ago here in Austin, we sent people down there pushing for eugenics, you go first, okay?
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:44.901]  Number one, we know you're full of bull, but you know what?
[02:47:45.001 --> 02:47:47.283]  I demand that you slit your own wrist.
[02:47:47.363 --> 02:47:48.924]  I demand you blow your own heads off.
[02:47:49.245 --> 02:47:51.947]  Stop saying I gotta die to make way for you and your scum.
[02:47:52.187 --> 02:47:53.748]  Get out of my way, trash!
[02:47:54.109 --> 02:47:57.171]  How dare you, you filthy, degenerate filth!
[02:47:57.792 --> 02:47:59.373]  You pieces of inbred trash!
[02:48:00.327 --> 02:48:05.437]  How that you killed so many people and the people that support this are killing or supporting the murder right now.
[02:48:06.801 --> 02:48:08.142]  And it's all through euphemism.
[02:48:08.202 --> 02:48:11.423]  Of course, we all want a good environment.
[02:48:11.483 --> 02:48:13.624]  We're for environmentalism, in theory.
[02:48:14.584 --> 02:48:18.086]  But under the name of environmentalism, we're still pursuing eugenics.
[02:48:18.166 --> 02:48:29.290]  Not only through population control, but Julian Huxley, who didn't die anytime soon, even though he was operational at the turn of the century, didn't die until 1975.
[02:48:29.731 --> 02:48:32.592]  Not only founded UNESCO directly after the war, which
[02:48:33.232 --> 02:48:34.673]  Has led to plenty of atrocities.
[02:48:34.693 --> 02:48:39.977]  Stay there, let's come back and talk about everything Hitler did and how they reorganized and now they're more powerful than ever.
[02:48:40.357 --> 02:48:43.700]  The entire world government system is being set up as an extermination grid.
[02:48:46.162 --> 02:48:52.246]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.587 --> 02:48:54.528]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.908 --> 02:49:02.514]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.228 --> 02:49:10.271]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.671 --> 02:49:22.096]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.416 --> 02:49:25.918]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.378 --> 02:49:28.339]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.639 --> 02:49:32.481]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.413 --> 02:50:47.134]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.354 --> 02:50:51.056]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.

[02:51:00.480 --> 02:51:05.383]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.583 --> 02:51:14.527]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[02:51:57.687 --> 02:52:01.315]  Aaron, let's just pick a date right now.
[02:52:01.977 --> 02:52:04.624]  Let's not make folks wait.
[02:52:04.644 --> 02:52:05.586]  Let's do this Monday.
[02:52:06.308 --> 02:52:06.709]  Third hour.
[02:52:07.774 --> 02:52:09.055]  We'll have to check the book in there.
[02:52:09.075 --> 02:52:16.019]  I should have done that, but a full hour sometime Monday to have you back in for part two of this because this is so important.
[02:52:16.039 --> 02:52:17.220]  We haven't even scratched the surface.
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:22.684]  Another key is the Rockefellers didn't stop funding eugenics after World War II.
[02:52:22.944 --> 02:52:24.225]  They intensified it.
[02:52:24.725 --> 02:52:28.868]  They also did all this cancer research and other stuff and then notice those numbers all go up.
[02:52:28.888 --> 02:52:32.270]  There's a lot of evidence that they've been involved in planting that and that's come out in the news.
[02:52:32.650 --> 02:52:33.771]  Aaron, close us out here.
[02:52:34.802 --> 02:52:35.623]  That's right, it's tough.
[02:52:35.643 --> 02:52:41.247]  The Rockefellers tend to insulate themselves a bit, but they don't mind it coming to the surface, apparently.
[02:52:41.688 --> 02:52:46.411]  John D. Rockefeller Jr., for instance, has his own Bureau of Racial Hygiene.
[02:52:46.431 --> 02:52:54.838]  But he didn't only do that, and not only did his father fund the Kaiser Willem Institute, he funded Margaret Sanger's Planned Parenthood organization.
[02:52:54.838 --> 02:52:56.079]  And by the way, they're still doing that.
[02:52:56.499 --> 02:53:05.184]  All the Rockefellers now, go look into all the hundreds of offspring, and like half of them are in eugenic societies and world population and global warming groups.
[02:53:05.564 --> 02:53:06.924]  Okay, this is their excuse.
[02:53:07.365 --> 02:53:11.347]  And when you begin to look at the bigger picture and you realize how much Rockefellers
[02:53:12.167 --> 02:53:12.368]  I think?
[02:53:31.986 --> 02:53:44.241]  And then again, towards the end of World War II, right before he died, advocated for the UN, advocated for the Universal Bill of Rights, specifically leaving out mentions of democracy or anything of that sort.
[02:53:44.261 --> 02:53:45.622]  Reproductive rights.
[02:53:45.743 --> 02:53:48.706]  And then in Article 30 and 29 it says you have no rights.
[02:53:49.046 --> 02:53:51.609]  For people listening, I want you to come away with this in Part 1.
[02:53:52.370 --> 02:53:54.891]  This is the governing system of the world.
[02:53:54.971 --> 02:53:56.692]  This is what they're truly into.
[02:53:57.092 --> 02:53:58.293]  This is their obsession.
[02:53:58.373 --> 02:53:59.854]  This is what they want.
[02:53:59.894 --> 02:54:01.094]  This is what they're setting up.
[02:54:01.574 --> 02:54:06.357]  And they get to kill people, be on power trips, and take all their resources after they've gotten rid of us.
[02:54:06.417 --> 02:54:08.938]  It is the ultimate religion of control freaks.
[02:54:08.958 --> 02:54:12.600]  Think of the most wicked control freak you can, and think of what their religion would be.
[02:54:12.640 --> 02:54:13.040]  This is it.
[02:54:13.743 --> 02:54:15.726]  Yeah, and my point is that this isn't gone.
[02:54:15.786 --> 02:54:19.650]  It's now thinly veiled behind organizations that ordinary people don't know about.
[02:54:20.011 --> 02:54:28.561]  Julian Huxley not only founded UNESCO, but he founded the World Wildlife Foundation, which gets into conservationalism and the idea of
[02:54:30.543 --> 02:54:31.764]  That's how they set it against man.
[02:54:31.804 --> 02:54:34.806]  They say all the animals deserve rights and we're the elite.
[02:54:34.826 --> 02:54:35.787]  We're going to vote for them.
[02:54:35.807 --> 02:54:40.411]  We have to take your resources in the name of the animals like a king would do 600 years ago in England.
[02:54:40.731 --> 02:54:43.694]  You had to be at subsistence level or sustainability.
[02:54:43.874 --> 02:54:44.955]  And yes, they coined the term.
[02:54:45.355 --> 02:54:47.397]  They moved eugenics also into the word sustainability.
[02:54:47.717 --> 02:54:52.298]  And when we get into sustainability, we're right back where we started with Malthus.
[02:54:52.758 --> 02:54:53.699]  Malthusian.
[02:54:53.719 --> 02:54:56.039]  The problem is the poor, not the poverty.
[02:54:56.159 --> 02:54:59.200]  Once you get rid of the poor, the poverty takes care of itself.
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:01.481]  And now we see it in the Club of Rome.
[02:55:01.621 --> 02:55:12.664]  I'm looking at a document right now from the Prince of Jordan, the head of the Club of Rome, from 2002, where they begin to call for a new international humanitarian order.
[02:55:12.724 --> 02:55:13.924]  Those are the capitalized letters.
[02:55:13.944 --> 02:55:16.045]  And they start their document with an H.G.
[02:55:16.085 --> 02:55:16.725]  Wells quote.
[02:55:17.285 --> 02:55:25.168]  If the universe is non-ethical by our present standards, we must really consider these standards, and we must reconstruct our ethics.
[02:55:25.769 --> 02:55:27.189]  And that's really what the procedure is.
[02:55:27.209 --> 02:55:29.470]  They're saying, there is no ethics, we're going to kill a bunch of people.
[02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:32.891]  And all the crimes they commit, they feel good about themselves.
[02:55:33.292 --> 02:55:35.433]  This is your enemy, this is your family's enemy.
[02:55:35.833 --> 02:55:38.614]  These are the pig people that have actually held us back.
[02:55:38.894 --> 02:55:42.655]  They are wicked control freaks that have this formula of control and domination.
[02:55:42.696 --> 02:55:46.157]  And the general public has been told by their media organs they don't exist.
[02:55:46.517 --> 02:55:47.777]  There's no North American Union.
[02:55:47.798 --> 02:55:48.758]  There's no New World Order.
[02:55:48.778 --> 02:55:49.678]  There's no eugenics.
[02:55:50.218 --> 02:55:52.059]  Oh, the global warming's real.
[02:55:52.099 --> 02:55:53.259]  Let's have a global tax.
[02:55:53.680 --> 02:55:56.381]  Oh, or your children are dead, as Rothschild said in the first hour.
[02:55:56.401 --> 02:55:57.381]  Incredible interview.
[02:55:57.401 --> 02:56:01.882]  By the way, that interview's about to restart with the rebroadcast that continues 24 hours a day.
[02:56:02.203 --> 02:56:03.663]  I'll see you Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:03.743 --> 02:56:04.143]  live.
[02:56:04.683 --> 02:56:07.384]  And we'll see you on the Internet at infowars.com.
[02:56:07.404 --> 02:56:10.586]  And, of course, the free podcast every day serves out at the end of the show.
[02:56:10.626 --> 02:56:12.666]  But there is the Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:56:12.866 --> 02:56:13.767]  Good job, Aaron Dice.
[02:56:14.127 --> 02:56:14.527]  Thank you, sir.
[02:56:14.967 --> 02:56:20.331]  Now, next Monday, you're going to be in here in one of the hours we're going to go into from World War II on for people.
[02:56:21.191 --> 02:56:22.012]  This is the key.
[02:56:22.052 --> 02:56:22.872]  God bless you all.
