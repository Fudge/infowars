[00:00:05.318 --> 00:00:05.978]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.638 --> 00:00:07.698]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.398 --> 00:00:09.559]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:10.979]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:12.720]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.981]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.481 --> 00:00:21.563]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.790]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.412]  It is already the ninth day of February, 2007.
[00:00:41.532 --> 00:00:50.560]  This is a live Friday edition coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas, the capital city.
[00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.801]  We'll be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.861 --> 00:01:01.148]  For the second and third hour in studio, we'll have Dr. Michael Kaufman joining us, an expert on the overall New World Order plan.
[00:01:02.068 --> 00:01:20.940]  He is also a particular expert with a particular expertise when it comes to the biosphere reserves, the man-of-the-biosphere reserves, the corridor, no-use, limited-use, human-use corridors that they're going to use in their new neo-feudalist state.
[00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:30.847]  So that is coming up in the second and third hour, getting into part two of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:01:33.337 --> 00:01:38.001]  In the meantime, we'll have open phones in the first, second, and third hour.
[00:01:39.062 --> 00:01:47.289]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.493]  More Ground Zero heroes on the record.
[00:01:52.073 --> 00:01:55.416]  Building 7 was deliberately brought down.
[00:01:56.557 --> 00:01:58.779]  Testimony of multiple rescue personnel
[00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.543]  We'll go back over some of those new clips.
[00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:33.179]  Not new to many of you, it's just there's so much evidence on 9-11 being an inside job that we frankly see a lot of it and then move past it forgetting that we had ourselves discovered this information years ago.
[00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:45.261]  By that, there are countless firefighters in newspapers and magazines and TV clips saying it looked like bombs were going off, bombs were going off, it looked like lava flowing.
[00:02:45.902 --> 00:02:48.644]  They told us to get back from Building 7, they were going to bring it down.
[00:02:48.764 --> 00:02:50.266]  Silverstein came out and said it.
[00:02:51.483 --> 00:03:06.390]  But there are just so many of these firefighters and emergency workers saying this that we discovered, I discovered, and several others that I had heard about in the past, but basically failed to report on properly.
[00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:09.451]  I mean, literally, it is an orgy of evidence.
[00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:10.572]  So we'll go back over that.
[00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:20.056]  Dovetailing with Dr. Michael Kaufman, joining us in studio in the next hour, a huge stack of news where the hype is just reaching
[00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:36.308]  Fever pitch upon fever pitch to push the fact that the earth is about to basically be flooded by the oceans and that if we don't have a world government and a world tax on carbon, our lives are basically going to end.
[00:03:37.048 --> 00:03:40.829]  Climate change concert to dwarf live aid.
[00:03:42.324 --> 00:03:43.826]  And what's Live Aid for Africa?
[00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:56.204]  That's just where people give a bunch of money to go to the private banks that's used to destroy Africa and force-inoculate the women and children with sterilization compounds and AIDS, you name it.
[00:03:57.151 --> 00:04:00.493]  Just the incredible arrogance of these people.
[00:04:00.933 --> 00:04:06.596]  Virgins Branson offers $25 million global warming prize, hyping it with Al Gore.
[00:04:07.197 --> 00:04:20.944]  It was as if they were trying to replay the famous skit of Charlie Chaplin, who has a beach ball with the globe of the earth on it, bouncing it around, dreaming of world conquest.
[00:04:21.024 --> 00:04:26.187]  Well, Al Gore and Branson pose for news cameras and photo cameras.
[00:04:27.087 --> 00:04:29.849]  I mean, this is just getting ridiculous.
[00:04:47.216 --> 00:04:49.917]  They're going to have mass scale HIV trial.
[00:04:50.598 --> 00:04:54.039]  Blackwater contractor kills vice president's guard.
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.601]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:57.201 --> 00:05:00.963]  Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are the websites.
[00:05:04.105 --> 00:05:09.549]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:17.514]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:25.329]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:37.134]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.454 --> 00:05:41.035]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.395 --> 00:05:43.376]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:47.518]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:05.753]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:13.114]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:06:13.274 --> 00:06:23.876]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:06:24.096 --> 00:06:28.637]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:33.918]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:06:34.118 --> 00:06:37.059]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.279 --> 00:06:47.142]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:06:47.182 --> 00:06:48.302]  Get a two-pack for only nine
[00:06:48.302 --> 00:06:48.562]  We're good.
[00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:06.754]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:06.974 --> 00:07:08.735]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.015 --> 00:07:15.299]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.704]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.964 --> 00:07:27.988]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[00:07:28.268 --> 00:07:34.676]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:07:34.836 --> 00:07:38.381]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:42.386]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:07:42.566 --> 00:07:45.110]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:46.271]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:46.571 --> 00:07:48.011]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:29.009]  Coming up at the bottom of this hour I'm going to play two clips again but this time a little bit more of the clips from an amazing radio show
[00:08:30.339 --> 00:08:33.463]  Guns and Butter over Pacifica Radio.
[00:08:34.004 --> 00:08:34.865]  Looked in our Rolodex.
[00:08:34.905 --> 00:08:37.869]  We even had the great talk show host, Card.
[00:08:37.889 --> 00:08:40.012]  We're going to be getting her on.
[00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:46.320]  She interviewed two of the people who responded as emergency workers on 9-11.
[00:08:47.882 --> 00:08:57.511]  Just two more in a long list of firefighters, police, emergency workers, people that just helped out, who were told, get back from Building 7, get back from Building 7.
[00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:00.614]  In fact, John, there's a new headline article.
[00:09:02.335 --> 00:09:05.418]  Whenever I talk to John, that's the fella up in Minnesota running the show.
[00:09:06.038 --> 00:09:10.262]  At the top of PrisonPlanet.com, headline, more Ground Zero heroes on the record.
[00:09:10.302 --> 00:09:12.004]  Building 7 was deliberately brought down.
[00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:23.022]  If you go into there, there's a clip that we've played before, so you don't have to search through the computer, of CNN, where the cops are saying, get back, get back, it's about to come down.
[00:09:23.102 --> 00:09:31.268]  There's two different police telling everybody to get back, literally seconds before Building 7 starts falling.
[00:09:32.199 --> 00:09:38.821]  Okay, so we have CNN with video of police saying, get back, it's coming down.
[00:09:39.641 --> 00:09:40.722]  They're gonna bring it down.
[00:09:41.442 --> 00:09:41.822]  Okay?
[00:09:42.362 --> 00:09:47.864]  Now that's, that is actual live video that was shot on the record.
[00:09:48.804 --> 00:10:01.808]  But that gets poo-pooed by the government operatives and their minions and fellow travelers out there that say, no, no, no, building 7, 47 story building, not hit by a plane, small fires, perfectly imploded into its own footprint,
[00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:08.499]  And then we just have all the firefighters, police and others saying, no, we were told to get back, we were told that it was going to be brought down.
[00:10:08.519 --> 00:10:14.442]  So we're going to go back through all of that because this is one of the key smoking guns.
[00:10:18.064 --> 00:10:26.229]  In fact, let's just go ahead and play the CNN clip where they're saying, get back from Building 7, literally seconds before it collapses.
[00:10:26.249 --> 00:10:26.669]  This is CNN.
[00:10:33.982 --> 00:10:38.068]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:39.269]  It's coming down.
[00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:42.734]  It's about to blow up.
[00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:43.595]  Move it back.
[00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:45.558]  Alright guys.
[00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:46.880]  We are looking back.
[00:10:54.346 --> 00:11:03.452]  Just in the last few seconds, another building, building number seven, one of the buildings in support of the World Trade Center towers has collapsed.
[00:11:04.292 --> 00:11:05.033]  Okay.
[00:11:05.993 --> 00:11:16.820]  Two different police waving people away, three times say, get back, the building's coming down, it's gonna blow up, it's gonna come down in just a minute.
[00:11:17.828 --> 00:11:18.688]  And then it falls down.
[00:11:19.109 --> 00:11:19.849]  Let's play that.
[00:11:19.969 --> 00:11:20.749]  Listen carefully.
[00:11:20.769 --> 00:11:24.711]  You can watch the video of them at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:11:25.331 --> 00:11:27.292]  But let's go ahead and play it one more time.
[00:11:27.312 --> 00:11:29.693]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:29.713 --> 00:11:30.113]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:30.153 --> 00:11:30.834]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:30.854 --> 00:11:31.314]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:31.334 --> 00:11:32.074]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:32.094 --> 00:11:32.575]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:32.595 --> 00:11:33.275]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:33.315 --> 00:11:33.835]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:33.915 --> 00:11:34.635]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:34.655 --> 00:11:35.176]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:35.196 --> 00:11:36.036]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:36.056 --> 00:11:36.456]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:36.476 --> 00:11:37.257]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:37.277 --> 00:11:37.757]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:37.777 --> 00:11:38.517]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:38.537 --> 00:11:39.057]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:39.077 --> 00:11:39.818]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:39.838 --> 00:11:40.238]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:40.958]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:40.978 --> 00:11:41.598]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:42.859]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:42.879 --> 00:11:43.299]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:44.040]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:44.580]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.500]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:45.920]  It'll be coming down.
[00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:46.661]  Keep your eye on that building.
[00:11:46.681 --> 00:11:47.321]  It'll be coming down
[00:11:55.046 --> 00:12:04.068]  Yes, in the last few seconds another building, building number seven, one of the buildings in support of the World Trade Center towers has collapsed.
[00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:04.709]  Alright.
[00:12:05.569 --> 00:12:06.029]  You know what?
[00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:12.291]  I'm going to get my pen out and I'm going to actually write down exactly what they say.
[00:12:12.311 --> 00:12:13.831]  And let's all do this together.
[00:12:14.071 --> 00:12:15.691]  Let's play the clip one more time.
[00:12:19.232 --> 00:12:21.073]  Again folks, here is CNN
[00:12:22.088 --> 00:12:24.770]  The clip, one more time, listen carefully.
[00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:25.891]  You ready with it again, John?
[00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:27.733]  Here it is.
[00:12:28.874 --> 00:12:33.858]  Just in the last few seconds, another building, building number seven.
[00:12:50.885 --> 00:12:53.428]  I only got two of those written down and there's at least one more.
[00:12:53.468 --> 00:12:54.569]  There may be four in there.
[00:12:54.729 --> 00:12:56.230]  One is the building is coming down.
[00:12:56.570 --> 00:12:58.052]  The building is about to blow up.
[00:12:58.412 --> 00:12:58.893]  Play it again.
[00:12:58.913 --> 00:13:00.895]  I want to write down that middle one.
[00:13:00.915 --> 00:13:02.156]  I couldn't write that fast.
[00:13:02.196 --> 00:13:02.616]  Play it again.
[00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:36.822]  Yes, in the last few seconds another building... Basically he says that building is coming down and then twice they say the building get back the building is about to blow up the building is about to blow up so three times get back it's coming down it's about to blow up.
[00:13:38.924 --> 00:13:44.628]  No modern steel structure building had ever fallen even when they burned in some cases five, six, seven days.
[00:13:45.929 --> 00:13:46.930]  Madrid of course in 2005
[00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:54.990]  Burned for almost two days with 100 plus foot white hot flames shooting up into the sky.
[00:13:56.371 --> 00:14:06.897]  Just go to your encyclopedia and look at flame heat or flame color and you will see it in any of your chemistry textbooks.
[00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:08.718]  You'll see it in any of your engineering textbooks.
[00:14:08.778 --> 00:14:09.479]  It's 101.
[00:14:09.919 --> 00:14:11.540]  You will see the image of a flame.
[00:14:13.862 --> 00:14:34.729]  And the corona of it, and you will see that it is, the lowest temperatures are red, and then red-orange, orange, orange-yellow, yellow, yellow-white, white, and then blue.
[00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.511]  And depending on what type of fire it is, the white or the blue may be the hottest.
[00:14:41.184 --> 00:14:43.185]  Just like when you strike a lighter.
[00:14:43.545 --> 00:14:44.886]  Okay?
[00:14:44.906 --> 00:14:52.770]  100 plus foot, white hot flames, filled with oxygen, shooting straight up in the air, because they were doing construction and remodeling.
[00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.431]  They had the windows off all the building.
[00:14:54.451 --> 00:14:59.934]  It was a building built back in the 70's, and it was what, 40 plus stories tall.
[00:15:00.755 --> 00:15:03.516]  And so it had a perfect flue, just like on your chimney.
[00:15:03.956 --> 00:15:10.320]  It was shooting an even aluminum desk in 3,000 plus degree temperatures.
[00:15:13.510 --> 00:15:16.072]  Only began to buckle, and the steel didn't even collapse.
[00:15:16.092 --> 00:15:21.295]  Oh boy!
[00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:32.321]  But Jet Fuel had already burned out 47 central steel columns, a bunch of columns around that, people in the gashes, waving their handkerchiefs, on cell phones.
[00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:33.142]  We ought to play that clip.
[00:15:33.712 --> 00:15:35.792]  Where I'm here, the fires are almost completely out.
[00:15:35.812 --> 00:15:37.893]  We have the firefighter tape saying two small fires.
[00:15:38.133 --> 00:15:40.073]  We can knock it down, extinguish all the flames in the building.
[00:15:40.093 --> 00:15:40.853]  We've played it many times.
[00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.254]  It's in my film, Martial Law.
[00:15:42.854 --> 00:15:46.114]  And then instantly all the columns magically shatter.
[00:15:47.575 --> 00:15:49.455]  I'm going to get more into this at the bottom of the hour.
[00:15:49.555 --> 00:15:54.616]  It's just that I don't even want to get into this subject without spending two, three hours on it.
[00:15:54.676 --> 00:15:56.776]  How do you even do justice with this much evidence?
[00:15:57.797 --> 00:15:59.177]  I think we need to just get like the
[00:16:00.962 --> 00:16:05.387]  I don't know, guesstimation, fifty-something clips of firefighters, police, emergency workers.
[00:16:06.929 --> 00:16:19.803]  I mean, in martial law alone, I've got, what, four clips of emergency workers and others saying that, oh yeah, they didn't tell me why, they just said, Building 7's coming down, get back.
[00:16:21.912 --> 00:16:25.955]  And I haven't even had the time to go grab those out of the film and upload them and put them up in the story.
[00:16:26.395 --> 00:16:33.339]  I think Paul Watson wrote a great article yesterday about this, but frankly he needs to go get Lou Cacioli out of People Magazine talking about bombs going off.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:43.366]  We need to add all of the other firefighter videotapes of them saying it looked like bombs going off, lava was flowing, it was like it being inside a foundry.
[00:16:43.386 --> 00:16:46.248]  That's a steel mill, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:47.134 --> 00:16:50.475]  Uh, we need to add the four clips or so that are in martial law.
[00:16:50.495 --> 00:16:51.175]  It may be more.
[00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:53.916]  I'm going from memory where we have eyewitnesses saying this.
[00:16:54.756 --> 00:16:57.777]  We have eyewitnesses, and I've talked to so many who heard it on NPR.
[00:16:58.257 --> 00:16:59.778]  I heard it on ABC News.
[00:17:01.058 --> 00:17:03.519]  Quite frankly, it was almost six years ago.
[00:17:03.539 --> 00:17:06.220]  I was driving in the car, flipping between WOAI
[00:17:07.463 --> 00:17:10.685]  That had, I believe, CBS at the time, and KLBJ had 590.
[00:17:11.646 --> 00:17:28.856]  And on one of the two, and again, I wasn't really paying attention, because, you know, everything was going on at the time, and I'd run to the store to get some stuff for my girlfriend at the time, now wife, and I'm driving, and I remember them saying, Building 7, to protect the other buildings, they may bring it down.
[00:17:29.777 --> 00:17:30.557]  I heard it!
[00:17:31.618 --> 00:17:33.119]  But we have CNN Video now!
[00:17:33.999 --> 00:17:34.780]  But the point is,
[00:17:36.446 --> 00:17:40.228]  This is an orgy of evidence.
[00:17:40.328 --> 00:17:41.989]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:49.253]  I mean, they send people to the gas chamber, to the lethal injection table, with two eyewitnesses.
[00:17:50.354 --> 00:17:50.654]  Okay?
[00:17:50.934 --> 00:17:53.256]  We don't have two eyewitnesses, we have hundreds.
[00:17:53.296 --> 00:18:01.140]  Folks, and again, we shot almost a hundred hours in the three days that I was in New York for the 2006 5th anniversary.
[00:18:07.074 --> 00:18:14.562]  And we would be in restaurants eating pizza, you know, five blocks from ground zero, and the fireman would try to buy us lunch.
[00:18:15.362 --> 00:18:20.468]  We would be walking out of, you know, a store where we went to use the restroom.
[00:18:20.668 --> 00:18:21.769]  We couldn't get away from the fireman.
[00:18:22.396 --> 00:18:24.277]  And again, it's not that I didn't want to talk to them.
[00:18:24.677 --> 00:18:26.257]  Literally, they would just tell, thank you.
[00:18:26.317 --> 00:18:27.278]  We know they blew it up.
[00:18:27.638 --> 00:18:28.538]  We were told to get back.
[00:18:28.618 --> 00:18:29.558]  Oh, will you go on camera?
[00:18:29.639 --> 00:18:29.899]  No.
[00:18:30.299 --> 00:18:30.979]  Some of them did.
[00:18:31.019 --> 00:18:33.920]  In fact, we've got over, I keep saying 90 hours.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.521]  It's over, it's actually over 100 hours because Matt went with us too.
[00:18:37.561 --> 00:18:39.222]  I forgot about him and he shot about 10 hours.
[00:18:39.242 --> 00:18:42.923]  So it's over 100 hours and we've got a bunch of them who did talk on tape.
[00:18:44.824 --> 00:18:48.745]  I mean, I'm sitting there in front of fire captains and police captains in full dress.
[00:18:50.868 --> 00:18:53.250]  In the line, going into the wound in the ground.
[00:18:53.831 --> 00:18:54.651]  In the ground zero.
[00:18:55.712 --> 00:18:57.233]  And I'm going, they blew it up!
[00:18:57.273 --> 00:18:58.134]  Control demolition!
[00:18:58.394 --> 00:18:58.875]  We know!
[00:18:59.015 --> 00:18:59.575]  Thank you!
[00:18:59.655 --> 00:19:00.196]  Keep it up!
[00:19:00.316 --> 00:19:01.677]  I mean, I have that on tape!
[00:19:03.271 --> 00:19:06.352]  But I've got a limited staff here scrambling around.
[00:19:06.632 --> 00:19:10.213]  Right now they're setting up cameras outside the studio, inside the studio with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[00:19:10.593 --> 00:19:12.333]  They're trying to upload the weekly TV reports.
[00:19:12.813 --> 00:19:16.954]  My point is, we've got so much evidence we can't even present it all.
[00:19:17.014 --> 00:19:24.116]  I bet detectives and prosecutors are listening know what I'm talking about when you've got some case where there's all this evidence, you've still got to go through it all.
[00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:26.496]  I mean, I'm literally just grounding it.
[00:19:27.857 --> 00:19:29.077]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:19:30.692 --> 00:19:42.136]  I could sit here for the next hour with the clips John's got on the computer, but it would take him an hour to go through all the thousands of clips on our computer and find the 50-something clips we've already got up there with firemen and police saying bombs.
[00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:51.499]  And I know we address this every month or so, but now it's just more and more and more and more and more and more.
[00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.660]  So we've got a job ahead of us.
[00:19:54.981 --> 00:19:58.222]  I, uh... It's just mind-blowing.
[00:19:58.242 --> 00:19:58.802]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.306 --> 00:20:04.328]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:04.629 --> 00:20:09.552]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:09.813 --> 00:20:14.176]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.456 --> 00:20:23.383]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.583 --> 00:20:27.206]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.486 --> 00:20:32.534]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:39.524]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:40.023 --> 00:20:40.703]  What about you?
[00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:46.686]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:47.767]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:20:47.907 --> 00:20:49.928]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.988 --> 00:20:52.409]  Hi folks, Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[00:20:52.449 --> 00:20:53.410]  The real money folks.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.461]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:11.481 --> 00:21:12.362]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:12.402 --> 00:21:13.423]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:13.523 --> 00:21:13.963]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:14.003 --> 00:21:16.425]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:21:16.445 --> 00:21:18.327]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:18.347 --> 00:21:19.788]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[00:21:19.808 --> 00:21:21.289]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:37.096 --> 00:21:40.137]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:21:40.698 --> 00:21:45.840]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.401 --> 00:21:51.062]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:21:51.743 --> 00:21:54.684]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:21:55.124 --> 00:21:56.525]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.502]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.042 --> 00:22:19.132]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion, and establish a world government?
[00:22:19.752 --> 00:22:29.059]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:29.939 --> 00:22:31.460]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:31.920]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.622]  Just call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:36.662 --> 00:22:36.982]  It's free.
[00:22:37.042 --> 00:22:39.123]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[00:23:02.421 --> 00:23:04.482]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:05.103 --> 00:23:14.028]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.468 --> 00:23:21.672]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.381 --> 00:23:27.883]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:28.363 --> 00:23:39.186]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:39.946 --> 00:23:41.967]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:42.507 --> 00:23:43.108]  We're good to go.
[00:24:20.356 --> 00:24:43.371]  On another 9-11 related issue, current World Bank President and former Assistant Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, gave a commencement speech in early 2001, in June of 2001, just a couple months, two and a half months before 9-11.
[00:24:48.294 --> 00:24:57.396]  Where he chillingly talked about sneak attacks in Pearl Harbor, and how everybody should basically get ready for it, and how these graduates need to be ready for it.
[00:24:57.496 --> 00:25:03.117]  And remember, they'd written the PNAC document just about nine months before.
[00:25:05.117 --> 00:25:10.739]  And in that particular PNAC document, Rebuilding America's Defenses, at the PNAC official website, they're very proud of themselves.
[00:25:10.899 --> 00:25:11.759]  They publish this.
[00:25:11.779 --> 00:25:12.519]  They like to brag.
[00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:15.559]  You've taken criminology, some of you out there.
[00:25:15.579 --> 00:25:17.840]  You know who likes to brag, don't you?
[00:25:19.102 --> 00:25:21.343]  That's their undoing, always.
[00:25:22.784 --> 00:25:24.345]  They all brag they can't help it.
[00:25:25.105 --> 00:25:30.748]  And they say, we need a helpful Pearl Harbor event as a catalyzing event on the order of Pearl Harbor or bigger.
[00:25:31.148 --> 00:25:34.049]  And the real mastermind of that was Zbigniew Brzezinski.
[00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:45.895]  And Zbigniew Brzezinski wrote in 97 of the Grand Chess Board that they needed a, quote, helpful Pearl Harbor event to mobilize the slaves of the West against the barbarians of the East.
[00:25:48.021 --> 00:25:48.542]  Please don't.
[00:25:48.802 --> 00:25:49.762]  I plug that book so much.
[00:25:49.822 --> 00:25:50.703]  Please don't give me money.
[00:25:50.743 --> 00:25:51.944]  Just go to the library.
[00:25:52.164 --> 00:25:54.565]  You can read the quotes online for free, but don't believe the quotes online.
[00:25:54.805 --> 00:26:05.491]  Go to the library and say, I'd like the Grand Chess Boards, the Big New Brzezinski, and just sit down for a few hours there in the quiet library with a hum of the air conditioner and read it for yourself.
[00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:15.957]  While you're there, say, I'd like Helmut Schmitzman and Powers, the former German Chancellor.
[00:26:16.767 --> 00:26:20.209]  Talking about how they do satanic rituals at the Bohemian Grove, written by him.
[00:26:20.269 --> 00:26:21.190]  Oh, just another issue.
[00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:24.412]  See, I'm into reading what they say.
[00:26:25.593 --> 00:26:27.014]  They brag about it.
[00:26:27.794 --> 00:26:31.937]  And no matter how crazy it sounds, we just can back up what we're saying here.
[00:26:31.977 --> 00:26:34.038]  These people are completely nuts.
[00:26:35.159 --> 00:26:41.743]  But elites throughout history, if you study history, you know elites, more often than not, are completely off the rockers, involved in every form of bizarreism.
[00:26:42.869 --> 00:26:55.422]  Because they have a taste for it, and they have almost total power, and temporal power as they call it, and they just need to exercise that power and the bizarreness.
[00:26:56.182 --> 00:27:02.789]  Basically, they can do whatever they want, so they want to do whatever they want, and that basically is anything under the sun.
[00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:04.911]  Each new height or depth
[00:27:05.469 --> 00:27:15.238]  Depending on how you look at it, wickedness is only an enticement to sink even lower into the depths of the slime pit.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.465]  Coming up in the next segment, I will read this great article by Paul Watson.
[00:27:23.877 --> 00:27:24.817]  That I contributed to.
[00:27:24.937 --> 00:27:27.218]  More Ground Zero heroes on the record.
[00:27:27.738 --> 00:27:30.299]  Building 7 was deliberately brought down.
[00:27:30.699 --> 00:27:40.881]  Testimony of multiple rescue personnel that they were told Building 7 was going to be imploded means FEMA, NIST, Silverstein Properties, and federal government all lied.
[00:27:41.421 --> 00:27:45.442]  Revelations demand immediate grand jury inquiry into insurance fraud.
[00:27:45.542 --> 00:27:49.603]  Vindicates call for new 911 investigation.
[00:27:49.684 --> 00:27:50.844]  They got greedy on 9-11.
[00:27:52.064 --> 00:27:59.206]  And one of the added insurance money from Building 7, Silverstein has now collected over $7 billion.
[00:27:59.226 --> 00:28:07.868]  If you see Marshall Law from 2005, I'll say over $6 billion, but then he had done an additional billion plus, so it's now over $7 billion.
[00:28:07.888 --> 00:28:08.749]  People will nitpick me.
[00:28:08.769 --> 00:28:11.269]  They'll take some new show and go, he's a $7 billion.
[00:28:11.289 --> 00:28:13.790]  I haven't even seen this, but he said $6 billion in this.
[00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:15.010]  Yes, things change.
[00:28:15.771 --> 00:28:19.192]  I get nitpicked when I go, you know, autism was in $168.
[00:28:21.719 --> 00:28:29.265]  And up from 1 in 20-something thousand, and then new numbers come out, it's even higher, and people go, wait, now he's saying it's 1 in 80-something.
[00:28:29.964 --> 00:28:32.045]  Well, that's because time moves on.
[00:28:32.525 --> 00:28:33.485]  Things get worse.
[00:28:33.505 --> 00:28:40.428]  You all say, oh look, the Governmental Accounting Office says we really have a $97 trillion debt.
[00:28:40.468 --> 00:28:42.089]  That's the total obligation.
[00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:49.651]  Someone will then studiously go pull a 2004 radio report where I'm reading the Dallas Morning News saying it is $44 trillion.
[00:28:51.512 --> 00:28:53.134]  And that's how these debts work.
[00:28:53.154 --> 00:28:55.796]  They just start exponentially growing, and they'll say, what is it?
[00:28:55.856 --> 00:28:56.937]  Is it $44 trillion?
[00:28:57.297 --> 00:28:59.599]  Or is it $97 trillion?
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:01.981]  Or is it $100 plus trillion?
[00:29:02.001 --> 00:29:09.868]  You know, yesterday I said it's over $100 trillion now, because that was last year's numbers that were really a few months old of $90 plus trillion.
[00:29:10.268 --> 00:29:13.731]  So I just want you to be aware of some of the debunkers' tactics.
[00:29:13.751 --> 00:29:19.496]  They're very childish, they're very low-grade moron level, but they work on some of the general public.
[00:29:20.606 --> 00:29:22.267]  They work on some of the general public.
[00:29:23.368 --> 00:29:27.110]  Because they'll just have a clip of me saying one thing and then a clip of me two years later saying another.
[00:29:28.071 --> 00:29:32.054]  And it's effective with some people.
[00:29:32.614 --> 00:29:34.756]  I'll do a whole show on their tactics.
[00:29:38.018 --> 00:29:39.078]  Baby, baby.
[00:29:40.339 --> 00:29:41.680]  Baby, baby.
[00:29:42.801 --> 00:29:44.242]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:44.282 --> 00:29:48.745]  We'll get into all the new 9-11 developments and then we'll take calls.
[00:29:51.218 --> 00:29:54.225]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.147 --> 00:29:57.833]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:02.065]  Hi, Michelle.
[00:30:02.105 --> 00:30:03.446]  I haven't seen you on the bus for a while.
[00:30:03.766 --> 00:30:04.786]  Did they change your shift?
[00:30:04.946 --> 00:30:05.466]  No, Lori.
[00:30:05.726 --> 00:30:07.007]  I finally quit my job.
[00:30:07.247 --> 00:30:09.428]  I'm working at home now, and I love it.
[00:30:09.808 --> 00:30:10.708]  No more commuting.
[00:30:11.188 --> 00:30:13.389]  And I'm home when the kids get out of school.
[00:30:13.569 --> 00:30:14.429]  Working at home?
[00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:15.450]  Doing what?
[00:30:15.730 --> 00:30:16.670]  It's a long story.
[00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:20.051]  It all started when I discovered the website EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[00:30:21.892 --> 00:30:25.376]  Oh, Michelle, you didn't fall for one of those internet deals, did you?
[00:30:25.597 --> 00:30:28.600]  Well, I looked into several, and this one is for real.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:29.781]  Are you sure?
[00:30:29.801 --> 00:30:35.108]  I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[00:30:35.328 --> 00:30:35.648]  Really?
[00:30:35.668 --> 00:30:36.990]  I've joined the success
[00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:38.071]  What was that website again?
[00:30:38.091 --> 00:30:38.331]  Good idea!
[00:30:38.371 --> 00:30:39.692]  Maybe we can go skiing this winter, too.
[00:30:39.712 --> 00:30:41.294]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com is a global opportunity.
[00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:05.625]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[00:31:05.845 --> 00:31:09.827]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.

[00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:05.612]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[00:32:05.932 --> 00:32:07.813]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[00:32:07.993 --> 00:32:11.054]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:32:11.234 --> 00:32:14.375]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:32:14.675 --> 00:32:16.516]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:32:16.796 --> 00:32:20.481]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:32:20.781 --> 00:32:23.424]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[00:32:23.444 --> 00:32:24.645]  2 Peter says,
[00:32:33.235 --> 00:32:37.576]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:32:37.876 --> 00:32:42.138]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.

[00:33:03.866 --> 00:33:06.927]  Big John!
[00:33:07.067 --> 00:33:09.627]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[00:33:09.667 --> 00:33:12.508]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[00:33:12.548 --> 00:33:15.088]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[00:33:15.148 --> 00:33:18.789]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[00:33:20.489 --> 00:33:22.449]  Big John!
[00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:25.550]  Big John!
[00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.750]  Big Bad John!
[00:33:28.971 --> 00:33:30.031]  Big John!
[00:33:32.154 --> 00:33:57.744]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home He just drifted into town and stayed all alone Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy But he didn't spoke at all, he just said hi to Big John Somebody said he came from New Orleans Where he'd gotten a fight over a Cajun queen And a crashing blow from a huge right hand Sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John
[00:33:59.594 --> 00:34:00.675]  Big John!
[00:34:02.396 --> 00:34:04.677]  Big John!
[00:34:05.197 --> 00:34:06.778]  Big Bad John!
[00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:10.200]  Big John!
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:17.024]  Then came the day at the bottom of the mine when the timber cracked and men started crying.
[00:34:17.104 --> 00:34:19.505]  Miners were praying and hearts beat fast.
[00:34:19.605 --> 00:34:22.787]  Everybody thought that they'd breathed their last except John.
[00:34:24.995 --> 00:34:47.934]  Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well Grabbed a sack and timber, gave out with a groan And like a giant old tree just stood there alone Big John Big John Big John Big Bad John Big John
[00:34:50.246 --> 00:35:15.438]  With all his strength he gave a mighty shove Then a miner yelled out, there's a light up above And twenty men scrambled for what would be grave And now there's only one left down there to save, Big John With jacks and timbers they started back down Then came that rumble way down in the ground And the smoke and gas fell straight out of that mine Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John
[00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.511]  Big John!
[00:35:20.111 --> 00:35:22.411]  Big John!
[00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:25.292]  Big Bad John!
[00:35:25.792 --> 00:35:27.813]  Big John!
[00:35:28.953 --> 00:35:34.294]  Now they never reopened that worthless pit, they just placed a marble stand in front of it.
[00:35:34.614 --> 00:35:42.617]  These few words written on that stand, at the bottom of this mine, lies a big, big man.
[00:35:43.737 --> 00:35:44.177]  Big John.
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:53.720]  Welcome back.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:55.481]  Never played all that.
[00:35:55.521 --> 00:35:56.301]  I thought I would.
[00:35:57.541 --> 00:36:06.183]  You know, before I go to Troy and Lucas and Conley and Jeff and James and Jim, I think I'll just go to you first and get a little bit of these new developments on 9-11.
[00:36:08.244 --> 00:36:10.925]  I want to explain something because I was thinking about this last night.
[00:36:12.981 --> 00:36:16.082]  I don't ever consciously have fear of the New World Order.
[00:36:16.282 --> 00:36:28.905]  I have fear of not fighting them, fear of them being able to carry out their program, fear of them being able to continue to spread AIDS and biological warfare and sterilization and forced sterilization and the slaverings they run.
[00:36:28.925 --> 00:36:33.986]  I have fear of them winning against the species and my family.
[00:36:34.566 --> 00:36:35.887]  But I see everybody as my family.
[00:36:35.907 --> 00:36:37.527]  It's just instinctive.
[00:36:38.407 --> 00:36:40.148]  This isn't some decision I even made.
[00:36:40.168 --> 00:36:41.168]  It's what I do.
[00:36:42.392 --> 00:36:48.176]  That's why I can't believe so many others don't put every ounce of their energy into this fight, and every ounce of their capital.
[00:36:49.617 --> 00:36:51.638]  I mean, these are really evil people we're talking about.
[00:36:51.658 --> 00:36:53.519]  It's a fact, and you can't deny it.
[00:36:53.539 --> 00:36:55.461]  You've got to stand up against it!
[00:36:57.122 --> 00:37:04.307]  But when I woke up, I mean, I guess I'd always knew quite a bit about history growing up around people that were into it, and I always read quite a bit.
[00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:10.591]  And really, just reading mainstream history, I learned about subterfuge and corruption and control and oppression.
[00:37:13.012 --> 00:37:33.522]  But when I started getting involved on air 12 years ago, even before that, getting involved in Buchanan campaigns and things, you know, I knew about the Federal Reserve, and I knew there were a group of big bankers who ran the IRS, and I knew that it was corrupt, but I was still somewhat of a novice.
[00:37:33.542 --> 00:37:36.343]  You know, the more you learn, the more you know how much you don't know.
[00:37:38.204 --> 00:37:40.565]  The greater my knowledge becomes, the more I become humble.
[00:37:42.606 --> 00:37:56.015]  And I remember the old-timers would tell me, yeah, there's plans to use foreign troops to put us in FEMA camps, and yeah, they're doing bad things to people, sterilizing them and putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:37:56.956 --> 00:38:00.198]  And yeah, they're into the occult, and they do weird rituals.
[00:38:00.718 --> 00:38:09.044]  I'd get these calls when I first got on talk radio and local cable television, and I'd say, okay, yeah, whatever, that's not true.
[00:38:10.512 --> 00:38:13.054]  And then over time I researched it and I found out it was true.
[00:38:14.015 --> 00:38:27.046]  And I found out that the people who were putting this out had just read the books published by the elitist and had read their own think tank documents or had been inside military intelligence or had been FBI agents and had discovered this on their own.
[00:38:29.928 --> 00:38:34.092]  But at about, I guess, 2.30, I'd been asleep by an hour or two,
[00:38:37.657 --> 00:38:40.319]  Sometimes I do wake up, and it's not even a fear.
[00:38:41.479 --> 00:38:45.202]  It's more of just a shock.
[00:38:45.842 --> 00:38:46.843]  It happens every few months.
[00:38:46.883 --> 00:38:48.084]  I'll just wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:38:48.124 --> 00:38:49.124]  Sometimes it's 5 a.m.
[00:38:49.144 --> 00:38:49.825]  Sometimes it's 3 a.m.
[00:38:49.885 --> 00:38:54.908]  And I'll wake up just wide awake, and I'll get up and go wash my face and look in the mirror.
[00:38:57.029 --> 00:39:00.471]  I'll kind of walk around in my house and go get a drink of water.
[00:39:03.813 --> 00:39:04.814]  And I just think about
[00:39:06.531 --> 00:39:08.533]  Man, these people really are evil.
[00:39:10.334 --> 00:39:12.115]  The things I'm talking about really are true.
[00:39:12.135 --> 00:39:15.658]  I mean, this stuff is real, and it just hits me.
[00:39:16.479 --> 00:39:23.644]  You know, the shock is all new, just of how incredible this is, and how dangerous, and how scary.
[00:39:25.105 --> 00:39:29.709]  And then I do have, you know, these tingles, these feelings of, my God, what have I gotten myself into?
[00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:46.819]  And then I literally, and you know I'm a Christian folks, not one of these mainline establishment one world government promoters, but I'm a Christian born and bred, and I have a personal relationship with Christ, and I just feel the comfort.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:57.386]  I literally feel that God comfort me, and I feel all your prayers comfort me, and I just, then I feel blessed.
[00:39:57.486 --> 00:39:58.466]  I'm so thankful.
[00:39:59.747 --> 00:40:01.228]  You know life goes by so quick,
[00:40:02.344 --> 00:40:03.205]  And it's so short.
[00:40:04.766 --> 00:40:11.329]  And so many people are just chasing beauty and youth and power and the logos and signets of success.
[00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:13.611]  And they're totally empty and unhappy.
[00:40:14.211 --> 00:40:20.755]  And for all my problems, and I'm far from a perfect person, I still am a very fulfilled, happy person.
[00:40:21.195 --> 00:40:24.337]  And every day I get closer to God.
[00:40:24.417 --> 00:40:26.479]  Every day I get closer to being a good person.
[00:40:26.879 --> 00:40:28.660]  Every day I'm given greater discernment.
[00:40:31.204 --> 00:40:33.085]  Every day I think I get a little bit better.
[00:40:33.686 --> 00:40:35.407]  I get a little bit more courage.
[00:40:37.808 --> 00:40:39.449]  Every day things become clearer.
[00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:43.752]  And my life means nothing to me.
[00:40:43.812 --> 00:40:44.852]  I mean, I enjoy it.
[00:40:44.892 --> 00:40:45.293]  I like it.
[00:40:45.313 --> 00:40:46.733]  I want to live to be 95 years old.
[00:40:46.753 --> 00:40:48.214]  I want to see my great-great-grandchildren.
[00:40:49.155 --> 00:40:51.596]  I want to see more sunsets and more sunrises.
[00:40:51.676 --> 00:41:00.682]  I want to jump into more clear, spring water fed pools in the low mountains of the Texas Hill Country.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:07.445]  I want to feel, in the spring, cold, wet grass, dew grass on my feet.
[00:41:09.086 --> 00:41:11.948]  I want to sit in a cold deer stand and watch the wildlife.
[00:41:12.108 --> 00:41:21.156]  I've got so many things that I want to do, but it is such a greater blessing to just set all those things aside for whatever comes and whatever happens.
[00:41:23.558 --> 00:41:28.502]  To be alive this one time, and to reject the world and all of its
[00:41:30.539 --> 00:41:38.621]  You think the flesh is great, you think the world is great, you think all this stuff is such a lure, but anytime you really attain it, you find out it's dirty rags.
[00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:40.061]  It really is dirty rags.
[00:41:41.602 --> 00:41:43.162]  Next to the higher calling.
[00:41:44.863 --> 00:41:52.504]  Next to trying to be a good person and build good things and be strong and tell the truth and help those that are weak and try to inform those that are ignorant.
[00:41:54.465 --> 00:41:55.505]  I just want to thank God.
[00:41:55.625 --> 00:41:57.886]  I can't believe how blessed I am.
[00:41:58.066 --> 00:41:58.606]  I am just
[00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:08.464]  That I am in the limited position I'm in to reach millions of people, but still it's a great responsibility with great power comes great responsibility.
[00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:12.206]  I am just deeply humbled.
[00:42:13.567 --> 00:42:24.033]  But by submitting and by humbling, now I understand really what it's all about.
[00:42:25.213 --> 00:42:26.474]  And there lies the strength.
[00:42:28.115 --> 00:42:30.096]  The strength of our race, the human race.
[00:42:30.891 --> 00:42:35.095]  And all the varieties of our race, the strength of our history.
[00:42:36.516 --> 00:42:38.238]  And I realize the illusion and the lie.
[00:42:39.459 --> 00:42:48.928]  People of the world, they see the skyscrapers, they see the marble floors and the capitals, the temples to their gods.
[00:42:49.729 --> 00:42:55.835]  They see the glitz and the glamour and they're caught up in an illusion and they think it's going to go on forever for them.
[00:42:56.508 --> 00:43:11.057]  Just because the world's been here for tens of thousands of years, our modern civilization for 6,000, just because humanity has been here throughout the millennia upon millennia, that's why you like seeing old things.
[00:43:11.077 --> 00:43:12.538]  That's why you like seeing old beautiful things.
[00:43:12.558 --> 00:43:16.181]  That's why you like looking at black and white pictures of your great-great-grandparents.
[00:43:16.781 --> 00:43:19.783]  That's why it gives you such a feeling of strength in your heart and you don't know why.
[00:43:20.558 --> 00:43:24.480]  It's because then you realize you're part of the experience of the species.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:32.724]  There is a group awareness, a group consciousness, a unbroken chain.
[00:43:34.905 --> 00:43:38.467]  And I see the New World Order doing everything they can to break that chain.
[00:43:39.768 --> 00:43:45.711]  I see the New World Order doing everything they can to obliterate everything that's
[00:43:47.748 --> 00:43:55.913]  But God is designed to be institutions of strength like the family, like the community, and it's not going to work.
[00:43:56.053 --> 00:43:56.894]  It cannot work.
[00:43:57.775 --> 00:44:04.359]  All their high technology, all their mind control, everything they've done, it will fail.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.161]  It is destined, it is guaranteed to fail.
[00:44:09.322 --> 00:44:13.164]  Well, he's first up, and he disagrees, so we go right to him.
[00:44:14.285 --> 00:44:15.406]  He's Troy in West Virginia.
[00:44:16.124 --> 00:44:18.085]  Troy, welcome to the Airwaves Worldwide.
[00:44:18.105 --> 00:44:19.345]  How are you doing?
[00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:20.526]  I'm doing well.
[00:44:21.066 --> 00:44:24.267]  Well, have you and the Loose Change crew totally lost your freaking marbles?
[00:44:25.027 --> 00:44:32.650]  I mean, you're sitting here reporting on InfoWars and Prison Planet, this hoax of a letter from an EMT person that's not even real.
[00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.991]  It's one of your own that did it, and you're posting it like it's fact.
[00:44:36.131 --> 00:44:38.232]  Can you not be more responsible than that?
[00:44:39.512 --> 00:44:41.933]  Can you not, like, look into this stuff before you go posting it everywhere?
[00:44:42.273 --> 00:44:44.734]  Even Nutball, Fetzer, and Judy Wood were talking about it.
[00:44:45.834 --> 00:44:46.475]  You understand?
[00:44:46.495 --> 00:44:49.219]  You gotta be more responsible than this.
[00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:52.625]  You mean your friends were attacking us concerning it, or what?
[00:44:52.925 --> 00:44:54.047]  No, they were agreeing with it!
[00:44:54.067 --> 00:44:55.209]  Feather and Wood, you mean?
[00:44:56.491 --> 00:44:58.354]  Well, you know something, Troy?
[00:44:58.474 --> 00:44:58.915]  You've made...
[00:45:00.663 --> 00:45:02.444]  False charges, you are the accuser.
[00:45:02.925 --> 00:45:04.105]  I don't make false charges!
[00:45:04.546 --> 00:45:07.228]  And, um... Oh, you're the one making false charges!
[00:45:07.288 --> 00:45:07.788]  Well, you know what?
[00:45:08.028 --> 00:45:08.829]  You've got the floor.
[00:45:08.889 --> 00:45:10.630]  Just go ahead and run your mouth, and I'll comment.
[00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:11.671]  You want me to run my mouth?
[00:45:12.311 --> 00:45:12.911]  Yeah, sure, go ahead.
[00:45:13.192 --> 00:45:20.817]  Look, there are 300 million people in this world, and you and I both know that 36% of these people think 9-11 was a full and total insane job!
[00:45:20.997 --> 00:45:23.358]  There's a 6.5 billion people in this world.
[00:45:23.378 --> 00:45:24.900]  I'm sitting in the United States of America.
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.521]  Oh, and that's your world?
[00:45:26.581 --> 00:45:27.561]  Okay.
[00:45:27.581 --> 00:45:29.222]  I misspoke, I'm sorry.
[00:45:29.503 --> 00:45:29.923]  It's okay.
[00:45:31.175 --> 00:45:31.897]  We both know 36% of 300,000.
[00:45:31.937 --> 00:45:32.217]  But still...
[00:45:37.088 --> 00:45:41.049]  It's safe to assume 36% of attorneys think it's a full and total inside job.
[00:45:41.389 --> 00:45:46.271]  Let's just assume, I'll use a low number here, 100,000 attorneys inside the United States of America.
[00:45:46.511 --> 00:45:50.372]  That means there's 36,000 of them that think it's a full and total inside job.
[00:45:50.732 --> 00:45:56.493]  I think you could round out a few thousand of those people to put the perpetrators of 9-11 to justice, but guess what?
[00:45:56.533 --> 00:45:57.374]  You can't do it.
[00:45:57.894 --> 00:46:06.236]  There have been, another false charge, there have been scores of lawsuits, literally hundreds, filed and they're all thrown out of court on national security.
[00:46:08.325 --> 00:46:10.367]  Well, then how are you going to prove 9-11 was an inside job?
[00:46:10.387 --> 00:46:11.228]  You're never going to do it!
[00:46:11.768 --> 00:46:14.931]  We have done it in the court of public opinion.
[00:46:16.192 --> 00:46:16.332]  Oh.
[00:46:17.933 --> 00:46:19.074]  So that means that's it?
[00:46:19.094 --> 00:46:19.495]  It's over?
[00:46:20.336 --> 00:46:22.898]  Well, let's take your statements one at a time.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:30.665]  We took the statement of someone who claims... Yeah, they hurt me.
[00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:31.786]  Let me talk.
[00:46:32.026 --> 00:46:32.606]  Let me talk.
[00:46:33.347 --> 00:46:33.687]  Okay?
[00:46:34.128 --> 00:46:34.368]  Troy?
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.982]  Just fade him down for a moment, and we'll give him equal time, but I just want to be able to counter this.
[00:46:40.762 --> 00:46:53.068]  And by we, I did take the story, the email posted by Dylan Avery, who I respect and think is trying to do the best job he can, and I think is genuine.
[00:46:53.949 --> 00:46:54.669]  The real McCoy.
[00:46:55.489 --> 00:46:56.290]  None of us are perfect.
[00:46:57.310 --> 00:47:03.193]  We did take that, and we did write an article about it.
[00:47:05.129 --> 00:47:26.141]  And we said in our article, regardless of whether or not this whistleblower, who we're trying to get to go public, is real or not, why doesn't the media focus on all these firefighters and EMTs and police and emergency workers who have said the same thing on record?
[00:47:27.122 --> 00:47:29.483]  And their names are public, they've been at public events.
[00:47:31.484 --> 00:47:33.946]  You know, I notice you don't call in and talk about the gentleman
[00:47:35.208 --> 00:47:48.797]  Who was on the bus that got bombed on 7-7 in 2005, who admittedly was on the bus, and saw them directed by the secret police there, and saw the secret police when it went off, and saw them out there with fake bandages and video cameras.
[00:47:49.537 --> 00:47:50.578]  Notice you don't attack that.
[00:47:51.038 --> 00:47:57.923]  And you don't attack the fact that we just played a scene in clip with two cops saying, get back, the building's coming down, it's gonna blow up, it's gonna be blown up.
[00:47:59.614 --> 00:48:05.659]  And you don't want to talk about the firefighters on New York television saying it was like lava, molten steel running down the channel rails.
[00:48:05.679 --> 00:48:10.703]  Well, the video we have of that from multiple news chopper cameras and from ground cameras.
[00:48:11.123 --> 00:48:12.645]  We have three different sources on that.
[00:48:13.686 --> 00:48:17.128]  Or Giuliani saying they were told to get out of Building 7 and it was going to be brought down.
[00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:18.790]  Or Silverstein saying it.
[00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:23.313]  You don't want to address any of that.
[00:48:23.894 --> 00:48:26.276]  You want to just out of the blue
[00:48:28.015 --> 00:48:36.062]  Claim that, number one, this guy's fake, when we don't know that, and we say out of the gate, we're going to check this out and try to get him to go public, try to get him to vet it.
[00:48:37.863 --> 00:48:38.223]  Okay?
[00:48:38.403 --> 00:48:41.926]  We just said, this is one more, and I even said, why are we even looking at this when we have all these others?
[00:48:44.548 --> 00:48:46.410]  And then you say that we forged it.
[00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:52.955]  Now, I ask you this question, and if you don't answer it, I'm going to hang up on you, because this isn't a serious debate if you don't.
[00:48:53.756 --> 00:48:57.219]  What is your evidence it's a fake letter, and what is your evidence that, quote, we
[00:48:58.744 --> 00:49:00.965]  We're separate, but I don't believe he would.
[00:49:01.025 --> 00:49:06.628]  Dylan Avery, Lothar Ward's Productions, or Jones Productions, what is your proof that we forged it?
[00:49:06.668 --> 00:49:08.129]  You did say that.
[00:49:08.149 --> 00:49:09.429]  One of your own forged it.
[00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:14.852]  One of your, okay, so what is your proof that one of our own forged it?
[00:49:16.633 --> 00:49:19.214]  Because this guy sent an email to Dylan Avery and Mark Radian.
[00:49:20.195 --> 00:49:21.295]  There's an email address.
[00:49:21.335 --> 00:49:22.296]  You go to MySpace.
[00:49:22.696 --> 00:49:24.277]  You do a search engine on that address.
[00:49:24.639 --> 00:49:30.740]  The guy, six months ago, had a MySpace account with the name V. Anybody with the name V is from V for Vendetta.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.821]  All them people are nutballed nutjobs.
[00:49:33.221 --> 00:49:34.481]  They are not approved.
[00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:35.181]  Let's go slow.
[00:49:35.201 --> 00:49:36.282]  You've got to talk fast there.
[00:49:36.562 --> 00:49:37.902]  Let's go over your proof right now.
[00:49:39.302 --> 00:49:40.023]  Well, excuse me?
[00:49:40.483 --> 00:49:44.724]  Somebody's got a V in their email address that proves... No, no.
[00:49:45.004 --> 00:49:46.164]  He's got an email address.
[00:49:46.344 --> 00:49:47.664]  You go to MySpace.
[00:49:48.384 --> 00:49:50.605]  You do a search by that email address.
[00:49:51.209 --> 00:49:52.209]  That pulls up a name.
[00:49:52.549 --> 00:50:07.014]  The guy's name is just the letter V. Now if you go, if you look at all your nut balls, MySpace pages, like there's a whole bunch of people with the name V and that little goofy, math... There's tens of millions of, let me stop you, there's tens of millions of people saying that.
[00:50:07.054 --> 00:50:09.234]  So that's your, that's your proof that it stays.
[00:50:09.274 --> 00:50:10.755]  Well that's, that's, that's interesting.
[00:50:12.035 --> 00:50:12.315]  Go ahead.
[00:50:12.435 --> 00:50:13.156]  It's one of your own.
[00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:13.836]  It's a fact.
[00:50:14.116 --> 00:50:14.876]  If I'm wrong, I'll,
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:21.523]  I'll buy every one of your movies, I promise you, off of Infowars.com.
[00:50:21.543 --> 00:50:22.944]  You can watch them for free.
[00:50:22.964 --> 00:50:24.865]  No, I want to buy them.
[00:50:24.905 --> 00:50:26.086]  But, Troy, let me go back here.
[00:50:28.208 --> 00:50:36.594]  You said that it's a lie, and I need to know your proof of that.
[00:50:36.854 --> 00:50:37.955]  You haven't given that proof.
[00:50:41.658 --> 00:50:41.958]  Troy?
[00:50:42.318 --> 00:50:42.538]  Yes?
[00:50:44.440 --> 00:50:45.140]  What's the guy's name?
[00:50:46.591 --> 00:50:48.493]  He's making stuff up that nobody knows.
[00:50:48.513 --> 00:50:50.275]  We happen to know his full name.
[00:50:50.315 --> 00:50:52.297]  We happen to know his full name now and where he lives.
[00:50:52.317 --> 00:50:53.378]  We're trying to get him to go public.
[00:50:53.779 --> 00:50:54.560]  He's very scared.
[00:50:54.580 --> 00:50:58.924]  Why don't you talk to Mr. Burlingame's daughter who got firebombed to death.
[00:50:59.765 --> 00:51:00.406]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:04.415 --> 00:51:09.882]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.242 --> 00:51:17.892]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:25.635]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.035 --> 00:51:37.463]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.764 --> 00:51:41.326]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.726 --> 00:51:43.648]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.988 --> 00:51:47.851]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.857 --> 00:52:03.898]  The war on terrorism.
[00:52:04.218 --> 00:52:06.999]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:07.279 --> 00:52:11.421]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:11.841 --> 00:52:12.682]  So what do you do?
[00:52:13.002 --> 00:52:17.564]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:18.044 --> 00:52:20.166]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:20.667 --> 00:52:21.568]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:52:21.968 --> 00:52:35.361]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:54:01.437 --> 00:54:03.658]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:54:04.199 --> 00:54:07.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.642 --> 00:54:12.963]  Alright, is Troy still there?
[00:54:14.663 --> 00:54:16.395]  I don't have all day to play games with you.
[00:54:17.438 --> 00:54:33.408]  Are you saying that the other emergency workers, firefighters saying bombs, saying molten steel, like a volcano, like a foundry, are you saying the emergency workers we played yesterday from nationally syndicated radio, that they're not real either?
[00:54:33.568 --> 00:54:37.131]  Are you saying they didn't say they were told to get back, that the building was going to be brought down?
[00:54:37.151 --> 00:54:43.294]  We just played CNN earlier, where two cops are on video saying, get back, the building's about to come down, it's about to blow up, building 7.
[00:54:43.995 --> 00:54:45.596]  Are you saying that isn't real either?
[00:54:46.673 --> 00:54:49.874]  I'm saying you're taking stuff out of context yet again as you always do.
[00:54:49.974 --> 00:54:52.494]  Okay, specifically how are we taking it out of context?
[00:54:53.995 --> 00:55:03.117]  They heard explosions, they were told the building was going to fall, which it had a big freakin' crater in it, and had huge fires in it, which you've always failed to mention that.
[00:55:03.137 --> 00:55:05.797]  A big crater after a burning tooth fell they did?
[00:55:05.837 --> 00:55:06.738]  Building 7 didn't?
[00:55:09.145 --> 00:55:11.887]  A chunk of the southwest corner was taken out of it.
[00:55:11.947 --> 00:55:13.469]  A little bit of facade and some windows.
[00:55:13.489 --> 00:55:13.929]  Oh, please.
[00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.550]  Please.
[00:55:15.130 --> 00:55:16.051]  You just need to quit lying.
[00:55:16.071 --> 00:55:16.651]  That's all you need to do.
[00:55:16.671 --> 00:55:17.072]  Just quit lying.
[00:55:17.092 --> 00:55:17.412]  I'm not lying.
[00:55:17.452 --> 00:55:18.233]  We have the photos.
[00:55:18.933 --> 00:55:19.854]  Yeah, I got the photos.
[00:55:19.954 --> 00:55:20.694]  You're the one.
[00:55:20.915 --> 00:55:21.495]  You're the one.
[00:55:21.515 --> 00:55:21.915]  Hold on.
[00:55:21.935 --> 00:55:22.276]  Hold on.
[00:55:22.336 --> 00:55:23.397]  You're the one that lied.
[00:55:24.357 --> 00:55:28.421]  Saying that you knew this was a forgery and that you knew it was a lie when you have no evidence.
[00:55:30.262 --> 00:55:31.243]  I'll bet my life on it.
[00:55:31.601 --> 00:55:33.182]  This one, nobody will ever come out.
[00:55:33.462 --> 00:55:36.224]  This is not a real... Nobody will ever come out?
[00:55:36.244 --> 00:55:44.129]  I mean, if a person did it, but the person's lying, 100% guarantee you, I guarantee you, 100% without a doubt.
[00:55:44.769 --> 00:55:47.511]  And oh, by the way, World Trade Center 7 never found its own footprint.
[00:55:47.791 --> 00:55:50.072]  Please quit repeating that lie over and over.
[00:55:50.112 --> 00:55:52.334]  It fell in a perfect, it fell in a perfect footprint.
[00:55:52.454 --> 00:55:53.314]  No, it did not.
[00:55:53.334 --> 00:55:54.055]  No, it did not.
[00:55:54.075 --> 00:55:54.735]  And quit lying about it.
[00:55:54.755 --> 00:55:56.616]  Okay, you keep saying lying, what's your evidence?
[00:55:58.438 --> 00:55:58.918]  Well, um...
[00:56:01.101 --> 00:56:04.264]  There was a building 30 West Broadway that was damaged because of it.
[00:56:04.564 --> 00:56:09.228]  And they even actually had to tear it down in 2006 because of the damage World Trade Center 7 caused to it.
[00:56:09.929 --> 00:56:14.493]  The US Post Office was 24 feet away and it got a few broken windows.
[00:56:14.533 --> 00:56:16.255]  The thing fell perfectly in its footprint.
[00:56:16.275 --> 00:56:16.555]  No it didn't.
[00:56:16.575 --> 00:56:17.256]  You're lying again.
[00:56:17.416 --> 00:56:18.317]  You're lying again.
[00:56:18.337 --> 00:56:20.339]  You just say I'm lying.
[00:56:20.579 --> 00:56:21.279]  You are lying.
[00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:22.801]  It's a lie.
[00:56:24.173 --> 00:56:25.837]  And, uh, I bet you think I'm lying.
[00:56:25.937 --> 00:56:28.662]  You said a few weeks ago when you called, I'm lying about the North American Union.
[00:56:29.023 --> 00:56:29.243]  Right?
[00:56:29.343 --> 00:56:30.425]  Don't change the subject.
[00:56:30.465 --> 00:56:31.107]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:31.127 --> 00:56:32.369]  You said that was a lie too, right?
[00:56:34.253 --> 00:56:34.814]  No comment.
[00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:35.955]  No, you did.
[00:56:35.995 --> 00:56:36.596]  We can go get the tape.
[00:56:36.616 --> 00:56:37.316]  I know I said it.
[00:56:37.356 --> 00:56:38.737]  What are you changing the subject for?
[00:56:38.757 --> 00:56:40.979]  Well, no, because you just say everything doesn't exist.
[00:56:41.079 --> 00:56:43.420]  You say we lie, and Lou Dobbs lies about everything.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.881]  We're all just a bunch of liars.
[00:56:44.901 --> 00:56:48.163]  Listen, you can't even get the Larry Silverstein quote right.
[00:56:48.624 --> 00:56:51.205]  You don't understand English like a normal person.
[00:56:51.225 --> 00:56:52.206]  We played it yesterday.
[00:56:52.226 --> 00:56:55.028]  You don't understand English like a normal person.
[00:56:55.088 --> 00:56:58.810]  And I bet you say Gulf of Tonkin wasn't a staged event, though it's totally declassified.
[00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:00.551]  There you go, changing the topic again.
[00:57:00.671 --> 00:57:04.254]  Well, no, because you know in the past you say everything's a lie.
[00:57:04.915 --> 00:57:06.856]  No, I don't disagree with everything you say.
[00:57:06.876 --> 00:57:09.897]  Oh wait, so Gulf of Tonkin wasn't a staged provocation, or was it?
[00:57:10.737 --> 00:57:11.777]  There you go changing the subject.
[00:57:11.797 --> 00:57:12.838]  I'm asking you a question.
[00:57:13.718 --> 00:57:16.179]  Yeah, you don't care about evidence of past behavior.
[00:57:16.479 --> 00:57:16.679]  Right.
[00:57:16.819 --> 00:57:22.421]  It's like if you've got a bank robber living on the street, and then the police shouldn't go questioning the guy that's robbed ten banks before and just got out of prison.
[00:57:24.882 --> 00:57:25.442]  Yeah, smooth.
[00:57:26.823 --> 00:57:27.243]  Pardon me?
[00:57:28.661 --> 00:57:28.841]  No, no.
[00:57:28.861 --> 00:57:31.942]  What I'm going to do is, I've got Dr. Michael Kaufman coming in for right around two hours.
[00:57:31.962 --> 00:57:35.603]  What I'm going to do is, the last 15 minutes, so I figure an hour and 45 is enough with the gentleman.
[00:57:35.623 --> 00:57:37.083]  We're going to interview him after for a film.
[00:57:38.244 --> 00:57:42.085]  I'll just play a bunch of clips of the firefighters and the police and the emergency workers.
[00:57:42.465 --> 00:57:49.227]  I'll just play all that and I'll play Silverstein again and I'll play it all for you coming up at the end of the third hour.
[00:57:51.904 --> 00:57:59.354]  I would just like to understand from you, NIST has given five different reasons Building 7 fell now.
[00:57:59.894 --> 00:58:05.501]  Which one of those five would you, because now they say none of those five caused it, which one are you still saying caused Building 7 to fall?
[00:58:05.682 --> 00:58:07.324]  I don't know what caused it to fall exactly.
[00:58:07.344 --> 00:58:08.265]  They will have the report out.
[00:58:08.325 --> 00:58:10.628]  Why had no modern steel building ever fallen?
[00:58:11.148 --> 00:58:12.489]  Yeah, another lie.
[00:58:12.509 --> 00:58:13.050]  There you go.
[00:58:13.070 --> 00:58:19.355]  There was a two-story tar roof warehouse in Chicago that collapsed.
[00:58:19.415 --> 00:58:21.016]  A tar roof wooden structure.
[00:58:21.256 --> 00:58:22.577]  And that's what you guys use.
[00:58:23.038 --> 00:58:23.858]  I'm not at the bunker.
[00:58:24.339 --> 00:58:27.361]  That's what popular mechanics used.
[00:58:27.681 --> 00:58:29.142]  A two-story tar building?
[00:58:29.643 --> 00:58:30.183]  Wooden building?
[00:58:33.486 --> 00:58:33.766]  Okay.
[00:58:34.106 --> 00:58:34.727]  Hey, listen.
[00:58:34.867 --> 00:58:36.208]  Always good talking to you, Troy.
[00:58:36.388 --> 00:58:36.808]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:58:36.828 --> 00:58:37.549]  The government's good.
[00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:38.189]  Everything's fine.
[00:58:38.210 --> 00:58:39.110]  There's no world government.
[00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.851]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.044 --> 00:58:45.887]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:45.927 --> 00:58:46.388]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.548 --> 00:58:47.328]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.528 --> 00:58:52.952]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.352 --> 00:58:54.933]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.193 --> 00:58:57.575]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.445 --> 00:59:09.447]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.627 --> 00:59:13.770]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.671 --> 00:59:17.852]  Who are the globalists?
[00:59:17.912 --> 00:59:19.113]  What is the New World Order?
[00:59:19.313 --> 00:59:21.734]  What will the world look like if they succeed with their plan?
[00:59:22.094 --> 00:59:22.975]  What are their goals?
[00:59:23.555 --> 00:59:25.917]  How do the different facets of globalization fit together?
[00:59:26.337 --> 00:59:29.939]  The nature corridors, no human use, limited use, compact cities.
[00:59:30.774 --> 00:59:34.376]  The Biosphere Zones, North American Union, Taxation Grid.
[00:59:34.556 --> 00:59:35.617]  These are some of the notes I've got.
[00:59:35.637 --> 00:59:37.378]  I want to go over with Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[00:59:37.598 --> 00:59:41.880]  We'll tell you about him coming up in the next segment when he joins us in studio.
[00:59:43.861 --> 00:59:46.562]  In the meantime, I promise to continue with your phone calls.
[00:59:47.123 --> 00:59:49.584]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[00:59:50.902 --> 00:59:52.803]  Lucas in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:59:52.984 --> 00:59:55.365]  Hey, what's up Alex, thanks for taking my phone call.
[00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:57.247]  What'd you think of that idiot in the last hour?
[00:59:57.467 --> 01:00:01.490]  Well, I think Detroit is about three lights shy of a pileup, first of all.
[01:00:03.051 --> 01:00:08.675]  You know, he's just, he's like when you feed a computer a paradox, he just can't figure it out, you know.
[01:00:09.235 --> 01:00:13.418]  I wanted to bring up two points, but then you played that clip, which brought a third point to my mind.
[01:00:14.098 --> 01:00:19.022]  Has anybody ever thought about Aaron Brown, how he quit CNN right after 9-11?
[01:00:19.042 --> 01:00:20.383]  I think he was sick of the lies.
[01:00:20.859 --> 01:00:24.602]  And maybe try to dig him up and see what his point of view on 9-11 was for one.
[01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.123]  Well, they brought him back, though.
[01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:30.646]  I haven't really seen much of Aaron Brown.
[01:00:32.187 --> 01:00:35.690]  I mean, as in, you know, being in the spotlight like he used to be.
[01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:42.335]  But the two points I wanted to bring up were, you know, the actual two groups of people that exist out there.
[01:00:43.776 --> 01:00:46.718]  One of them is the people that are awake, that aren't doing anything.
[01:00:46.738 --> 01:00:48.199]  They're like a deer caught in headlights.
[01:00:48.675 --> 01:00:52.137]  And another group is the people that are like the ostrich with their head stuck in the ground.
[01:00:52.837 --> 01:00:58.380]  See, this isn't going to work because we don't have a decent, you know, we have to have a decentralized organization.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.340]  We can't have a leader.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:03.743]  So every person that's awake needs to at least wake up one person.
[01:01:03.963 --> 01:01:08.105]  They at least need to take it on themselves to go out there and actually wake up one person.
[01:01:08.385 --> 01:01:12.327]  You know, you need to put in some personal sacrifice if you want to get anything out of this.
[01:01:12.347 --> 01:01:15.408]  Like, for instance, with me, you know, I was supposed to get married in March.
[01:01:15.448 --> 01:01:16.609]  I put my wedding on hold.
[01:01:17.077 --> 01:01:18.338]  I gave up my good job.
[01:01:18.398 --> 01:01:22.021]  I've sold more than half of my own personal belongings to promote 9-11 Truth.
[01:01:22.101 --> 01:01:24.803]  I moved to Austin, Texas so I could be closer to the fight.
[01:01:25.223 --> 01:01:26.844]  You know, I'm not going to run away from it.
[01:01:26.924 --> 01:01:30.347]  I'm going to come towards the action because, I mean, that's the only way to beat it.
[01:01:30.827 --> 01:01:39.213]  You know, it's like the people in that movie, Deep Impact, where the giant wave was coming down over New York City and all these people are running from it.
[01:01:39.513 --> 01:01:40.634]  What's the use?
[01:01:40.794 --> 01:01:43.536]  I mean, you might as well turn around and flip at the bird.
[01:01:43.836 --> 01:01:46.518]  There's nothing you can do about it, so you might as well stand and fight it.
[01:01:47.014 --> 01:01:49.475]  You know, that's just one point I wanted to bring up.
[01:01:49.855 --> 01:01:54.236]  If my fiancé is out there listening, I want to say, baby, I love you and miss you a lot.
[01:01:54.796 --> 01:02:03.039]  It's been a long, hard road, that's for sure, but everybody's going to have to make some personal sacrifice if you're going to want this to work out, or else we're all going to be slaves.
[01:02:03.339 --> 01:02:04.719]  That's basically the bottom line.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.020]  I agree with you.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.220]  We don't stand up against it.
[01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:09.801]  We will all be slaves.
[01:02:09.921 --> 01:02:10.841]  Thank you for the call.
[01:02:12.602 --> 01:02:13.842]  Who's calling from Oklahoma?
[01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:17.121]  Conley, you're on the air.
[01:02:17.161 --> 01:02:17.501]  Welcome.
[01:02:18.602 --> 01:02:18.842]  Hello?
[01:02:19.222 --> 01:02:19.842]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:02:19.862 --> 01:02:22.443]  Hey, uh, thank you.
[01:02:23.003 --> 01:02:25.864]  God bless you, Mr. Jones, and I've been praying for you.
[01:02:25.884 --> 01:02:29.265]  Hope some allergies are, uh, you know, leaving you alone right now.
[01:02:29.285 --> 01:02:30.505]  They have been abating, yes.
[01:02:31.246 --> 01:02:32.846]  Yeah, well, thank God for that.
[01:02:33.846 --> 01:02:37.187]  Uh, I just want to say, uh, bring this to your attention.
[01:02:37.228 --> 01:02:40.028]  This is, uh, New World Order, I think, in action.
[01:02:40.969 --> 01:02:45.170]  Uh, in Tulsa, they have the, uh,
[01:02:45.632 --> 01:02:49.633]  Parents are not allowed to go into the schools anymore unless they swipe.
[01:02:49.653 --> 01:02:50.593]  Yeah, that's nationwide.
[01:02:50.613 --> 01:02:52.254]  The parents have to have ID cards.
[01:02:52.274 --> 01:02:53.314]  They're not even allowed to get in.
[01:02:53.334 --> 01:02:56.715]  They have to go through police and swipe cards and run background checks.
[01:02:56.955 --> 01:02:58.035]  There are little mini prisons.
[01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:04.017]  And this is a big part of the globalist takeover is saying that the schools will be the place where they re-engineer the youth.
[01:03:04.957 --> 01:03:09.358]  Yeah, it's... I'm just glad they didn't do that when I was in school.
[01:03:09.978 --> 01:03:13.919]  Anyone who has their children in a government training camp needs to have their head examined.
[01:03:15.814 --> 01:03:19.218]  I don't care if you've got to work two or three jobs extra to put them in private school or homeschool them.
[01:03:19.518 --> 01:03:20.199]  Do it folks!
[01:03:20.299 --> 01:03:21.020]  Get them out of there!
[01:03:29.613 --> 01:03:32.375]  Y'all have to fingerprint your driver's license?
[01:03:32.395 --> 01:03:37.397]  Yes, that's the national ID card, Real IDX, or biometrics of your driver's license.
[01:03:37.717 --> 01:03:39.578]  It's really a North American Union ID card.
[01:03:39.898 --> 01:03:42.800]  Thank you for the call, Dr. Michael Kaufman, in studio.
[01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:44.961]  On the other side, thank you for joining us.
[01:03:44.981 --> 01:03:45.561]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.241 --> 01:04:01.688]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.068 --> 01:04:09.718]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:17.442]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.842 --> 01:04:29.267]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.587 --> 01:04:33.229]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.549 --> 01:04:35.490]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:39.652]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:20.953]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[01:07:22.814 --> 01:07:26.016]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:32.560]  There are voices in the street, and the sound of running feet.
[01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:36.263]  And they whisper the word, REVOLUTION.
[01:07:38.504 --> 01:07:42.467]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[01:07:44.267 --> 01:07:58.891]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Revolution!
[01:08:01.351 --> 01:08:10.774]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[01:08:13.164 --> 01:08:28.489]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar REVOLUTION!
[01:08:49.108 --> 01:08:49.869]  We're good to go.
[01:09:26.123 --> 01:09:26.565]  I think so.
[01:09:44.611 --> 01:09:45.972]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:53.900]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, Ph.D., has such a lengthy bio, I wouldn't even attempt to try to cover it all, but he was assigned to the U.S.
[01:09:53.980 --> 01:10:00.986]  Forest Service decades ago in developing an ecological land classification system for each of the national forests in Region 9.
[01:10:01.067 --> 01:10:04.330]  Again, that ties into the whole Gen 21 New World Order program.
[01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:08.471]  He has been at the highest management levels in major U.S.
[01:10:08.491 --> 01:10:09.291]  corporations.
[01:10:10.032 --> 01:10:18.254]  He is currently the President of Environmental Perspectives, and he is really one of the leading experts in a wide-spectrum analysis of the New World Order.
[01:10:18.694 --> 01:10:30.718]  Back in the mid-1990s to late 1990s, some of his environmental mapping of current and projected biosphere, man-in-the-biosphere zones, national and international heritage sites,
[01:10:31.238 --> 01:10:31.858]  Thank you.
[01:10:31.878 --> 01:10:33.359]  It's much warmer down here than Bangor.
[01:10:33.779 --> 01:10:34.139]  I bet.
[01:10:34.179 --> 01:10:35.459]  Network, are you getting him good?
[01:10:35.479 --> 01:10:35.879]  Is his audio good?
[01:10:54.935 --> 01:10:55.515]  Fantastic.
[01:10:55.555 --> 01:11:07.418]  Dr. Kaufman, because you can talk about yourself better than I, I know you're a humble man and don't like to, give the listeners just a brief rundown of who you are, how you woke up, and then let's go through the basics and then into the specifics of the Globalist Master Plan.
[01:11:07.839 --> 01:11:16.461]  Well, I have a PhD, Alex, in Environmental Sciences and Forestry and have actually done research, taught in universities and so forth for a number of years.
[01:11:17.555 --> 01:11:30.105]  And JOIN was a timber company, a paper company back in 1980 to do research primarily, head up the research primarily for that particular company in forests and ecosystems and so forth.
[01:11:30.966 --> 01:11:43.596]  And it was during that time I was working on a multi-million dollar research effort on the effects of acid rain and global climate change on our nation's forests that I became aware that, you know, the environmentalists, I worked closely with the EPA and the U.S.
[01:11:43.636 --> 01:11:45.918]  Forest Service and many environmental organizations
[01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:51.112]  And it became very obvious to me that they really weren't interested in protecting the environment.
[01:11:51.172 --> 01:11:53.374]  They were interested in advancing an agenda.
[01:11:54.274 --> 01:11:58.656]  And so I began to do research as to what it is that was motivating them and where they were going.
[01:11:59.197 --> 01:12:07.621]  And I was shocked to realize that at least in the leadership, both of our government and the non-governmental organizations that were involved in this,
[01:12:08.425 --> 01:12:11.592]  We're what's called pantheists, the belief that nature is God.
[01:12:11.972 --> 01:12:18.125]  And therefore, their role was not in serving the American people, but in protecting nature from the American people.
[01:12:18.746 --> 01:12:25.273]  And really this is just a little management cult group that the big central bankers of the world system use to implement.
[01:12:25.533 --> 01:12:28.896]  For the listeners that just joined us, tell folks about your education and what your doctorate is in.
[01:12:29.417 --> 01:12:34.522]  My doctorate is in forest ecology and sciences and had been doing a lot of research in that particular area.
[01:12:34.542 --> 01:12:42.730]  I actually did develop an ecological classification system back in the 1980s in order to help foresters and help land managers
[01:12:43.504 --> 01:12:48.428]  None of us want to hurt the earth, but they know that everybody deep down wants to protect the environment, so they use that.
[01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:53.491]  In fact, in my studies, modern environmentalism was started by John D. Rockefeller I over 100 years ago, and they ran
[01:13:06.581 --> 01:13:07.181]  No, I don't.
[01:13:25.126 --> 01:13:25.286]  Yes.
[01:13:25.346 --> 01:13:30.170]  And then no one's allowed to go into it, and it's five-star hotels, five-star spas, five-star... In 20 years, yes.
[01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:30.830]  Exactly.
[01:13:30.890 --> 01:13:32.111]  Well, here it was in 10.
[01:13:32.452 --> 01:13:40.138]  Five-star golf courses, the smallest homes, $1 million apiece, and many of the people involved in it actually live there in these huge estates themselves.
[01:13:40.358 --> 01:13:44.441]  Can you speak to the Rockefellers and the Globalists and how the modern environmental movement was started?
[01:13:44.681 --> 01:13:47.163]  Well, it was actually 100 years ago with Mir,
[01:13:48.999 --> 01:13:49.659]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:20.275]  It actually languished for about a hundred years until the 1960s with the advent of the New Age movement and the counterculture movement.
[01:14:20.475 --> 01:14:23.077]  And then it began to take on some real power.
[01:14:23.257 --> 01:14:26.219]  Which thought it was counterculture but really foundation funded the whole time.
[01:14:26.279 --> 01:14:26.719]  That's right.
[01:14:26.859 --> 01:14:37.925]  The whole counterculture movement was orchestrated and funded not only by the foundations but was inspired by a pantheistic belief system, a cult religious belief system
[01:14:38.505 --> 01:14:39.286]  We're good to go.
[01:14:55.134 --> 01:14:55.694]  Let's go through.
[01:14:55.714 --> 01:14:57.335]  We've got a lot of notes here I want to cover.
[01:14:57.996 --> 01:14:59.316]  Who are the globalists?
[01:14:59.877 --> 01:15:05.280]  The globalists, there's actually five different layers of globalists that are trying to vie for world power.
[01:15:05.780 --> 01:15:09.282]  And the most important one is the banking system, as you alluded to a little while ago.
[01:15:09.822 --> 01:15:14.025]  The banking system of both England or Great Britain and the United States.
[01:15:14.245 --> 01:15:16.006]  I call it the Anglo-American faction.
[01:15:16.718 --> 01:15:19.019]  They are a powerful, powerful organization.
[01:15:19.279 --> 01:15:24.501]  I can't say that they actually run the United States and Great Britain, but they do heavily influence.
[01:15:24.561 --> 01:15:29.223]  It's called the shadow government, and basically, if they want to implement a program, it's done.
[01:15:30.483 --> 01:15:30.883]  It's done.
[01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:32.104]  Wouldn't you call that running it?
[01:15:32.384 --> 01:15:36.205]  It's pretty much close to running it, although they do suffer setbacks.
[01:15:36.245 --> 01:15:37.526]  There are factions.
[01:15:37.546 --> 01:15:41.607]  They don't have total control, but they're able to guide and steer, and they never give up.
[01:15:42.048 --> 01:15:43.808]  They never, ever give up.
[01:15:43.928 --> 01:15:45.889]  If they can't get it one way, they will get it another.
[01:15:46.897 --> 01:15:47.921]  Well, let's break that down then.
[01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:51.673]  In specifics, how much control does the Anglo-American faction have?
[01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:56.816]  The Anglo-American faction, basically, if they want to put something in place, it will happen.
[01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:57.677]  They will try.
[01:15:57.717 --> 01:16:00.198]  They'll put up trial balloons to see what will work.
[01:16:00.939 --> 01:16:05.602]  This concept of the North American Union is one of those that they're striving for right now.
[01:16:06.243 --> 01:16:08.464]  And if that doesn't work, then they'll call it something else.
[01:16:08.524 --> 01:16:12.147]  It'll be the same program, whether it's in education, science, it doesn't matter.
[01:16:12.207 --> 01:16:18.271]  Whatever particular area they want to gain control over, they will basically throw up these balloons to see what works.
[01:16:19.091 --> 01:16:23.234]  If that doesn't work, they'll change the name, maybe change it slightly as far as how they proceed to do it.
[01:16:23.695 --> 01:16:28.458]  And eventually, it may take 5 years, it may take 20 years, in some cases 30 years, but it will happen.
[01:16:29.039 --> 01:16:36.544]  Right now, we're seeing a full court press where they turn off the Colosseum in Rome, they turn off the lights for 5 minutes at the Eiffel Tower.
[01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:39.647]  Prince Charles won't fly to a certain function on a jet.
[01:16:39.707 --> 01:16:42.209]  Nancy Pelosi can't have a bigger jet because it may hurt.
[01:16:43.009 --> 01:16:49.374]  The environment, the Speaker of the House, they're going to have climate change concerts, they say that will dwarf Live Aid.
[01:16:50.215 --> 01:16:56.020]  They have Virgin Atlantic's Branson offering $25 million in a global warming prize.
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:03.005]  There's a doomsday vault that now has to even fortify itself because they say the Earth just may totally flood.
[01:17:03.045 --> 01:17:10.411]  And their answer is a global carbon tax, which even if you believe in global warming does nothing to address that.
[01:17:10.911 --> 01:17:11.913]  That's exactly right.
[01:17:12.473 --> 01:17:15.378]  In fact, the whole global warming issue is a farce.
[01:17:15.598 --> 01:17:20.525]  It's a sham, basically, to advance this agenda and create a condition in which the United States
[01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:33.932]  So instead of assuming the United States is going to be willing to give up our sovereignty in order to control what they perceive as a doomsday scenario, that if they don't get a handle on it within the next 10 years, that's what we've been hearing now.
[01:17:34.092 --> 01:17:39.576]  Actually, if you remember back in the early 1990s, they said we had 10 years to do it, or we're doomed.
[01:17:39.997 --> 01:17:44.080]  Well, now it's been 15 years ago now, and of course nothing's changed.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.801]  Well, the same thing is going on right now.
[01:17:46.302 --> 01:17:50.065]  Global warming is occurring, don't get me wrong, but it's not caused by man.
[01:17:51.721 --> 01:17:57.344]  From all the studies I've done, is it not the sun that is increasing its radiance?
[01:17:57.584 --> 01:17:57.844]  Yes.
[01:17:58.625 --> 01:18:02.727]  We had what was called the Little Ice Age back in the 1700s and 1800s.
[01:18:03.107 --> 01:18:08.550]  During that period of time, there was a high correlation between sunspot activity and the energy output of the sun.
[01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:13.312]  There were almost no solar flares, no sunspots during the 1700s and early 1800s.
[01:18:15.254 --> 01:18:18.417]  And it got about a degree, degree and a half colder than it is right now.
[01:18:18.657 --> 01:18:19.738]  They were observing the sun.
[01:18:19.758 --> 01:18:23.020]  The British societies and others were observing it then.
[01:18:23.261 --> 01:18:23.521]  Yes.
[01:18:24.061 --> 01:18:29.466]  It goes back to Galileo when he was able to develop his telescope and we were able to really take a close look at the sun.
[01:18:29.586 --> 01:18:30.346]  Stop right there.
[01:18:30.406 --> 01:18:35.270]  Let's talk about what's really causing global warming versus what they're saying is causing it.
[01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:39.273]  And the UN's own report that came out two weeks ago admits, okay man, 6% of the change.
[01:18:40.274 --> 01:18:43.258]  So what does a tax do that won't even reduce emissions?
[01:18:43.659 --> 01:18:44.580]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:48.865]  But they know as a general public, who just hears the hype, we gotta have a solution.
[01:18:48.966 --> 01:18:50.588]  They don't even know what this quote solution is.
[01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:55.867]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:18:56.167 --> 01:18:58.228]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:18:58.468 --> 01:19:00.989]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:19:01.429 --> 01:19:05.791]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[01:19:05.911 --> 01:19:06.491]  Here's why.
[01:19:06.511 --> 01:19:13.154]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:19:13.434 --> 01:19:19.616]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're
[01:19:19.616 --> 01:19:19.936]  I'm not.
[01:19:20.056 --> 01:19:23.797]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:19:23.997 --> 01:19:28.239]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:19:28.699 --> 01:19:35.861]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:19:36.321 --> 01:19:38.725]  Get control, get relief, get some sleep!

[01:19:55.294 --> 01:19:57.578]  70 ounce gold coins are 68207, 340, 359 for half, 171.79 for quarter ounce.
[01:19:57.618 --> 01:19:58.018]  That's 68207, 340, 359, and 171.79.
[01:20:07.711 --> 01:20:10.012]  1971, Nissan closes the gold window.
[01:20:10.052 --> 01:20:15.495]  Fiat currency, 1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:20:15.835 --> 01:20:18.756]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:20:18.776 --> 01:20:22.398]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:24.419]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:20:25.259 --> 01:20:27.981]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:20:28.001 --> 01:20:33.363]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:20:33.523 --> 01:20:34.824]  Could government let this happen?
[01:20:34.924 --> 01:20:36.885]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:44.150]  Midas has Nick Bereshev's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, full market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:20:44.190 --> 01:20:45.911]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:47.092]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:20:47.152 --> 01:20:47.452]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.930 --> 01:20:58.155]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:20:58.295 --> 01:21:06.402]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:13.708]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:21:13.888 --> 01:21:15.169]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:21:15.249 --> 01:21:21.153]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:21:21.334 --> 01:21:26.417]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:21:26.537 --> 01:21:35.404]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:21:35.684 --> 01:21:42.629]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at
[01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.391]  803-4438.

[01:21:47.713 --> 01:21:50.495]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:21:50.695 --> 01:21:54.818]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[01:21:55.158 --> 01:21:57.099]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[01:21:57.319 --> 01:22:01.282]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[01:22:01.802 --> 01:22:03.484]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:22:03.724 --> 01:22:05.805]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[01:22:06.045 --> 01:22:11.169]  If there was only something natural I could take that would help control my blood sugar, that really works.
[01:22:11.449 --> 01:22:12.790]  Have you tried sucroblast?
[01:22:13.584 --> 01:22:18.668]  For millions of Americans who can't keep their high blood sugar levels off their minds, there's Sucroblast.
[01:22:19.229 --> 01:22:23.592]  Sucroblast is the all-natural way to help keep your high blood sugar levels under control.
[01:22:24.133 --> 01:22:28.136]  For a limited time, you can get a free consultation from a Sucroblast specialist.
[01:22:28.657 --> 01:22:31.039]  Call 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[01:22:31.439 --> 01:22:33.761]  That's 1-800-99-HEALTHY.
[01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:40.126]  Or visit them on the web at MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com That's MyBloodSugarBreakthrough.com
[01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.080]  So, Jane, what do you think?
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:47.181]  I'm going to call Sucroblast to set up a free consultation right now!
[01:22:47.501 --> 01:22:48.281]  Excellent, Jane.
[01:22:48.381 --> 01:22:49.582]  He'll be glad you did.
[01:22:58.323 --> 01:23:06.265]  Every move the globalists make, every bond they break, every scam they run, we're going to be here exposing them.
[01:23:09.771 --> 01:23:16.275]  NASA, the European Space Agency, the Japanese Space Agency, scores of private universities all study the Sun.
[01:23:16.755 --> 01:23:21.238]  Its last 12-year cycle was the biggest radiance ever recorded.
[01:23:22.019 --> 01:23:23.980]  And now they're saying that it didn't stop there.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.461]  It's continuing to increase.
[01:23:26.261 --> 01:23:36.666]  And NASA said last year, and they hope this doesn't happen, I certainly hope it doesn't, that its radiance could double in the next 12 years if it doesn't start reversing that.
[01:23:37.066 --> 01:23:47.010]  That's pretty scary, Dr. Michael Kaufman, and I don't think SUVs have anything to do with the nuclear reactions in the center of the sun.
[01:23:47.291 --> 01:23:47.831]  Not likely.
[01:23:48.471 --> 01:23:53.332]  It is very interesting that the solar radiation and the Earth's temperature are highly correlated.
[01:23:53.372 --> 01:23:56.212]  In fact, they can actually be almost on a daily coordination.
[01:23:56.913 --> 01:24:12.535]  We had a major solar eruption back in 1998, at the same time as we had El Nino, and we had a solar spike within a week, a temperature increase within a week of that event that peaked out within a few days, about a week or so.
[01:24:12.895 --> 01:24:13.615]  And this is global.
[01:24:13.655 --> 01:24:16.276]  This isn't just the United States or a local regional area.
[01:24:16.316 --> 01:24:16.996]  This was global.
[01:24:17.788 --> 01:24:18.590]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[01:24:25.476 --> 01:24:27.337]  Actually changed the Earth's temperature right away.
[01:24:27.797 --> 01:24:36.502]  And if you go back into the 1700s, you can actually see the correlation between the Earth's temperature and the emissions of radiant energy by the Sun.
[01:24:36.682 --> 01:24:43.686]  Did you see the NASA report about the Sun just intensifying its overall emissions to a level that they never recorded?
[01:24:43.986 --> 01:24:49.889]  Yes, in fact, this is not really surprising because it's very likely that the solar emissions were much higher at one time.
[01:24:49.909 --> 01:24:50.409]  In fact, in 1200 A.D.,
[01:24:52.327 --> 01:24:56.690]  The temperature of the Earth was about a degree and a half warmer than it is today.
[01:24:56.751 --> 01:24:57.871]  I mean, it was much warmer.
[01:24:57.911 --> 01:25:00.774]  If you go back a thousand years ago, it was even warmer yet.
[01:25:00.854 --> 01:25:02.375]  So this is nothing really new.
[01:25:02.735 --> 01:25:04.316]  And how do they gain those readings?
[01:25:04.717 --> 01:25:06.798]  They actually look at sedimentation in the ocean.
[01:25:06.838 --> 01:25:16.586]  At this recent time, they can look in bogs and so forth for the type of pollen in the oceans as the type of crutations and so forth of the sedimentation levels.
[01:25:17.126 --> 01:25:23.531]  Those things live at certain temperatures and therefore they can calculate roughly what the Earth's temperature was based on that.
[01:25:23.571 --> 01:25:26.834]  It's not real accurate of course, but it's accurate when you start talking about degrees.
[01:25:26.994 --> 01:25:28.375]  Don't the ice cores show the same?
[01:25:28.475 --> 01:25:29.676]  The ice cores show the same.
[01:25:29.696 --> 01:25:37.763]  And ironically, the ice cores for the most part, there are a couple of exceptions, but the ice cores themselves show that carbon dioxide increases
[01:25:38.443 --> 01:25:40.966]  Usually after global warming begins.
[01:25:41.146 --> 01:25:48.534]  The European Space Agency and NASA and many others also reported in the last year the entire solar system including the ice caps of Mars are melting.
[01:25:48.614 --> 01:25:52.078]  That's correct and again it shouldn't be surprising if the sun gets warmer
[01:25:52.754 --> 01:25:55.337]  The Earth should get warmer too, as does Mars.
[01:25:55.377 --> 01:25:58.159]  I mean, it's really not a hard thing to make a connection to.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:04.165]  Won't that warming, at least from past studies they've done, actually increase the vegetative growth belts?
[01:26:04.425 --> 01:26:09.270]  Yes, in fact, NASA has taken pictures and have actually posted them on their internet site showing
[01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:18.956]  That the northern latitudes, the far northern latitudes, have actually greened up considerably in the last 20 years because of the increase in carbon dioxide and temperature.
[01:26:19.537 --> 01:26:21.898]  Carbon dioxide is called a plant fertilizer.
[01:26:21.938 --> 01:26:23.159]  That's what causes it to grow.
[01:26:23.219 --> 01:26:28.503]  I mean, a plant takes in carbon dioxide, uses it to build cells and food and so forth.
[01:26:28.563 --> 01:26:35.428]  And I've seen the big studies that have been done by multiple universities and institutions, and tell me if I'm wrong, this is what your doctorate's in,
[01:26:36.088 --> 01:26:41.130]  But plants, unlike humans, will just grow faster and actually take in more carbon dioxide.
[01:26:41.190 --> 01:26:46.933]  And so, if there is an increase in carbon dioxide, plants will just increase absorption and then increase level of oxygen.
[01:26:47.273 --> 01:26:47.793]  Absolutely.
[01:26:47.973 --> 01:26:50.894]  The more the plants grow, the more oxygen there is and the more food.
[01:26:51.054 --> 01:26:55.116]  In fact, there are some scientists, now this is a hot debate right now within the scientific community,
[01:26:55.757 --> 01:27:05.020]  But there are some scientists that will actually say that we could potentially increase food production in the world by 50% by nothing more than increasing or doubling the level of CO2.
[01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:13.804]  Well, we know it was the end of the last ice age that allowed agrarian societies to move from hunter-gatherers to agrarian, then to the city-states, and then to civilization.
[01:27:13.944 --> 01:27:14.484]  Absolutely.
[01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:16.205]  In fact, back in 1200 A.D.
[01:27:16.245 --> 01:27:22.667]  when we had what's known as the medieval optimal, they were growing crops, the Vikings were growing crops in Greenland where there's now hundreds of feet of ice.
[01:27:23.969 --> 01:27:26.732]  So, again, we have many ice ages, we have many heat-ups.
[01:27:26.933 --> 01:27:27.473]  That's correct.
[01:27:27.994 --> 01:27:29.796]  And we have many ones.
[01:27:29.836 --> 01:27:34.501]  About the last 11,000 years, we had warmer periods, cooler periods, warmer periods, cooler periods.
[01:27:34.521 --> 01:27:36.863]  If you look at the trend over the last 10,000, 11,000 years, the trend is downward.
[01:27:39.921 --> 01:27:43.822]  And we should be more concerned with the next ice age than we should be with global warming.
[01:27:43.942 --> 01:27:47.563]  It has been much warmer than it is right now in the last 11,000 years.
[01:27:48.163 --> 01:27:55.125]  Going back to those temperatures will actually probably increase food production, increase the habitable parts of the world, and so forth.
[01:27:55.165 --> 01:27:57.466]  What are the studies on the photo plankton?
[01:27:58.126 --> 01:27:58.726]  The photo what?
[01:27:59.006 --> 01:28:02.667]  What are the studies on what increased temperatures will cause with plankton?
[01:28:03.584 --> 01:28:16.191]  Actually, the increase in temperatures will increase the cause of plankton, which will increase the food supply, because plankton is a basic food substance in the ocean, the basis of the food chain in the ocean, so you're going to have far more productive oceans.
[01:28:18.032 --> 01:28:21.314]  So it sounds to me like global warming is a good thing overall.
[01:28:22.054 --> 01:28:22.715]  I believe it is.
[01:28:23.374 --> 01:28:25.135]  Now, we need to approach this cautiously.
[01:28:25.495 --> 01:28:27.216]  There's not much we're going to be able to do about it.
[01:28:27.256 --> 01:28:34.219]  This whole idea of Kyoto and so forth, of trying to limit carbon dioxide emissions, as you mentioned earlier, is a fiasco.
[01:28:34.419 --> 01:28:41.482]  At best, it might reduce the actual Earth's temperature by 0.15 degrees in the next hundred years.
[01:28:41.562 --> 01:28:42.022]  Stay there!
[01:28:43.563 --> 01:28:44.463]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.944 --> 01:28:46.564]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.465 --> 01:28:50.146]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.775 --> 01:28:55.476]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:28:55.656 --> 01:28:56.897]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:28:57.137 --> 01:28:59.959]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:29:00.339 --> 01:29:03.101]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:29:03.642 --> 01:29:10.366]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:43.973]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:29:43.993 --> 01:29:44.934]  Globalists are concerned
[01:30:06.021 --> 01:30:06.642]  We're good to go.
[01:30:24.557 --> 01:30:25.057]  I think so.
[01:30:52.578 --> 01:30:55.080]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:31:01.964]  Did you know that at the 29 Palms Marine Base located in California, a questionnaire was given to Marines stationed there?
[01:31:02.685 --> 01:31:06.027]  It discussed the United States military under UN command.
[01:31:06.707 --> 01:31:08.168]  Would the Marines accept this?
[01:31:08.368 --> 01:31:18.915]  The final statement to be answered, yes or no, was, I would fire upon American citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.
[01:31:19.575 --> 01:31:20.995]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:31:21.135 --> 01:31:22.876]  Forced confiscation of guns?
[01:31:23.456 --> 01:31:31.058]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:31:44.322 --> 01:31:45.303]  Call now.
[01:31:45.503 --> 01:31:51.965]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:31:59.068 --> 01:32:00.049]  We're discussing vital
[01:32:01.827 --> 01:32:02.528]  We're good to go.
[01:32:21.007 --> 01:32:26.488]  We're having discussions about which Mexican food restaurant to go to, but we really shouldn't be consuming that much.
[01:32:26.548 --> 01:32:27.708]  It's bad for the earth.
[01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:33.370]  I want to go back into global warming, but first, the five different globalist factions.
[01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:38.911]  I've talked to you about this before, but it's important, and I agree with your five factions, because all governments are wicked.
[01:32:39.511 --> 01:32:40.491]  History shows that.
[01:32:40.591 --> 01:32:41.551]  Common sense shows that.
[01:32:41.591 --> 01:32:42.591]  The Bible says that.
[01:32:42.932 --> 01:32:49.913]  But let's go over the five different factions, and then we'll get back into global warming, and then just run through who the globalists are, what their master plan is.
[01:32:50.353 --> 01:32:52.956]  Well, we've already talked about the Anglo-American faction.
[01:32:52.976 --> 01:32:54.978]  That's the banking system, really, of the world.
[01:32:55.498 --> 01:32:56.840]  They control the money flow.
[01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:58.582]  They control the money, basically, of the world.
[01:32:58.622 --> 01:33:00.023]  That makes them very, very powerful.
[01:33:00.443 --> 01:33:06.089]  That's controlled by Great Britain and the United States, the power elite of Great Britain and the United States.
[01:33:06.129 --> 01:33:07.391]  Would you say they're the dominant group?
[01:33:07.931 --> 01:33:09.493]  Absolutely, by far, by heads.
[01:33:09.953 --> 01:33:11.715]  Then you have the socialist Europeans.
[01:33:12.035 --> 01:33:12.736]  They're the second.
[01:33:12.776 --> 01:33:21.706]  They were actually joined with the Anglo-American faction for a number of decades, but about 30 years ago they began to split off because they did not like capitalism.
[01:33:21.746 --> 01:33:25.470]  They wanted to have a socialist form of government, totally socialist.
[01:33:25.530 --> 01:33:30.576]  Now, the capitalists would like to have socialism too, because socialism allows them to control you and I.
[01:33:31.337 --> 01:33:34.400]  But the Socialist Europeans want to be in the driver's seat.
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:36.782]  They do not want to be held hostage to the banks.
[01:33:37.302 --> 01:33:46.790]  And therefore, they have another faction, and they have been playing behind the scenes in a number of ways to try to discredit the banking system, to try to discredit America and the United States.
[01:33:47.370 --> 01:33:53.694]  And they're pushing very hard the Kyoto Protocol because the Kyoto Protocol will cause the United States to go bankrupt.
[01:33:53.734 --> 01:33:54.274]  And they know it.
[01:33:54.775 --> 01:33:58.157]  And they want to be in control of that whole agenda by the United Nations.
[01:33:58.437 --> 01:33:59.357]  And you always have this.
[01:33:59.377 --> 01:34:02.859]  Let's take a classical, say, Italian Mafia model.
[01:34:03.119 --> 01:34:07.182]  And we know this from the hearings and the testimonies and it's now on record.
[01:34:08.162 --> 01:34:12.865]  And of course it was called a conspiracy theory in the 50s and didn't exist according to Hugh Hoover because they were blackmailing him.
[01:34:13.165 --> 01:34:14.006]  But we did get the model.
[01:34:14.426 --> 01:34:21.849]  You had really ten big families that would meet in New York, they'd meet in New Jersey, they would meet in Miami every year.
[01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:26.311]  One of these meetings actually got busted, but this was a smaller elite, but the same type model.
[01:34:26.631 --> 01:34:28.432]  You've got ten, twelve families around the table.
[01:34:28.752 --> 01:34:36.836]  They fight with each other, they try to undercut each other, but they still agree upon the major criminal operations they're running against the public and keeping them in the dark.
[01:34:36.856 --> 01:34:43.799]  Can you parallel just the classical mafia to the larger global mafia and how they compete with each other at a higher level, but at the same time
[01:34:51.645 --> 01:34:52.105]  Absolutely.
[01:34:52.145 --> 01:34:55.768]  In fact, I never thought of it in the context of the Mafia, but that's exactly what happens.
[01:34:55.788 --> 01:35:02.293]  You know, we can't reinvent what human beings have done in the past, and they really picked up that same model at the globalist level.
[01:35:02.854 --> 01:35:13.742]  And then within the, you have the third one, which is the Russian Federation, and those, and the various colonies and so forth of Russia that is trying, it's a very distant cousin, let me tell you, as far as power is concerned.
[01:35:14.426 --> 01:35:21.551]  But they're acting more as a spoiler to come in and try to ruin the plans of the Anglo-American faction.
[01:35:21.652 --> 01:35:30.438]  Now, from my research, the Anglo-American faction had a lot of control during the Cold War, but it does seem that now it is split away to a certain extent.
[01:35:30.858 --> 01:35:31.399]  That's correct.
[01:35:31.439 --> 01:35:32.700]  In fact, it was by design.
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:36.643]  Obviously, the Soviet Union had to fall if we were going to have world government.
[01:35:37.203 --> 01:35:44.365]  We couldn't have two major power factions that were still vying for one another like we did with the Soviet Union and the United States.
[01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:49.026]  And as you said, the European faction is now working to make the dominant unipolar system fall.
[01:35:49.246 --> 01:35:49.706]  That's right.
[01:35:50.146 --> 01:35:51.106]  So they're in control.
[01:35:51.166 --> 01:35:53.567]  Now, none of these are against world government.
[01:35:53.927 --> 01:35:56.548]  What they really want is to be in power for themselves.
[01:35:56.568 --> 01:36:00.189]  They want to be the top dog in what actually emerges as the world government.
[01:36:00.609 --> 01:36:01.489]  Then you have China.
[01:36:01.709 --> 01:36:05.510]  China's another spoiler, and I think we're going to hear a lot more about China here in the next year or two.
[01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:11.292]  And what they're trying to do, and they've got their fingers in this North American Union, too.
[01:36:11.392 --> 01:36:18.694]  So, I mean, it's one of those things where China's playing a major role in manipulation of the world economy and so forth, and they're a major player.
[01:36:19.154 --> 01:36:22.215]  And then, finally, 9-11 was the Islamists.
[01:36:22.756 --> 01:36:23.816]  There's no question about it.
[01:36:23.856 --> 01:36:35.320]  The Islamic community was behind 9-11, primarily funded by Saudi Arabia and the sheiks and so forth, and Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:36.600]  We're good to go.
[01:36:55.482 --> 01:36:58.965]  So who's pulling that fifth small faction strings, in your view?
[01:36:59.205 --> 01:37:00.846]  I think it's the Anglo-American faction.
[01:37:00.866 --> 01:37:10.253]  I think there's every evidence to suggest that the Anglo-American faction is using that hatred within the Islamic movement to foment that kind of thing.
[01:37:10.393 --> 01:37:16.017]  After all, if you have a world government, one of the reasons that they've been able to gain so much control is by using fear.
[01:37:16.696 --> 01:37:17.296]  We're good to go.
[01:37:29.471 --> 01:37:31.272]  You have the Cold War, that peters out.
[01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:35.716]  Now you have war on terror, war on drugs, war on environmental degradation.
[01:37:35.796 --> 01:37:36.676]  That's exactly right.
[01:37:36.716 --> 01:37:42.521]  They needed to have a straw horse out there that would keep people in a state of fear so that they can be controlled.
[01:37:42.541 --> 01:37:49.166]  That's always been the efforts of rulers since time immemorial, is that they use fear to keep their people in line.
[01:37:49.566 --> 01:38:05.906]  We have the dominant faction, the Anglo-American establishment, clearly going in in the late 70s, trying to radicalize the Muslims, that's now on record, even paying for the Hadith manuals in these schools to radicalize, actually starting the war with the Soviets to pull them in.
[01:38:06.747 --> 01:38:12.989]  We know that now this former CIA section chief, he went on History Channel and admitted that our government actually put Mao into power.
[01:38:13.309 --> 01:38:24.413]  We know that in the 70s they quote, went public with that and opened China up to use that as an economic leverage point to de-industrialize the United States and Western Europe as well.
[01:38:24.893 --> 01:38:25.894]  That's worked wonderfully.
[01:38:26.414 --> 01:38:29.495]  And then we also know the Anglo-American banking establishment has
[01:38:30.095 --> 01:38:30.676]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:38:51.039 --> 01:38:57.383]  Well, you actually see the Anglo-American faction manipulating the hatred and so forth of the Islamists.
[01:38:57.403 --> 01:39:00.705]  Well, that's in P2OG where they say, we're going to go attack them and then make them attack us.
[01:39:00.825 --> 01:39:01.346]  That's correct.
[01:39:01.786 --> 01:39:07.770]  Because if you can't have war as a motivating factor anymore, because you have a world government that's supposed to be at peace, right?
[01:39:08.319 --> 01:39:09.941]  Can you speak to problem reaction solution?
[01:39:09.961 --> 01:39:10.001]  No.
[01:39:30.101 --> 01:39:35.104]  I mean, my problem, reaction, solution, you were just going over it, how they create crises and then offer a solution?
[01:39:35.284 --> 01:39:36.645]  Yes, no question about it.
[01:39:36.685 --> 01:39:46.410]  It goes right along with the Hegelian dialectic, where you create a crisis of major magnitude to get people to accept something lesser in the process they've lost what they've had in the first place.
[01:39:47.145 --> 01:39:49.247]  I mean, break that down, because I've heard you break it down in the past.
[01:39:50.868 --> 01:39:52.089]  I mean, other examples of that.
[01:39:52.129 --> 01:40:00.336]  I mean, is that why they fund the Soviets, they fund the Communist Chinese, they actually build up Communist revolutions in Latin America, then they have the counterbalance?
[01:40:00.876 --> 01:40:03.118]  It happens all the time, all around the world.
[01:40:03.598 --> 01:40:10.524]  And it's one of those things where you have to keep the people in a state of agitation in order to get them to go along with what you want to do.
[01:40:10.644 --> 01:40:14.427]  And as long as you have them in a state of fear, in fact, our founding fathers, Hamilton and others,
[01:40:15.043 --> 01:40:26.279]  Basically said that we will lose our freedoms, not from attack from the outside, but attack from the inside by people creating a state of fear and we're willing to give up our freedoms for peace and security.
[01:40:27.341 --> 01:40:31.367]  We've walked through the five big factions, just boiling it all down, condensing it.
[01:40:32.503 --> 01:40:33.664]  We know there's a world government.
[01:40:33.704 --> 01:40:34.784]  We know there's world tax.
[01:40:35.105 --> 01:40:36.345]  We know there's a world court.
[01:40:36.766 --> 01:40:46.972]  Walk us through that and then why they're pushing all this hype that quote there's global warming and that a carbon tax or wellhead tax will fix it.
[01:40:47.692 --> 01:40:49.793]  Absolutely.
[01:40:49.813 --> 01:41:03.680]  In fact, if you're going to have a world government, as they're trying to do with the United Nations, it may not wind up being the United Nations, but there will be some sort of world government.
[01:41:04.477 --> 01:41:06.699]  They need to have money to operate in.
[01:41:07.159 --> 01:41:10.041]  They need to have a lot of it, because it's going to be a bureaucracy.
[01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:12.322]  They will not have an elected form of government.
[01:41:12.442 --> 01:41:15.004]  You're going to be ruled by bureaucrats that have their own agenda.
[01:41:15.184 --> 01:41:19.547]  That's clear, very clear, in what the United Nations is proposing in its various treaties and so forth.
[01:41:20.197 --> 01:41:27.641]  And they have been very active in trying to get a global tax, the Tobin tax, you name it, tax on wellheads, the carbon tax, you call it.
[01:41:28.341 --> 01:41:35.524]  They're talking about raising trillions of dollars in taxes to support this bureaucracy and it's going to come right out of your pocketbook.
[01:41:37.606 --> 01:41:38.386]  So let's be clear.
[01:41:40.097 --> 01:41:44.740]  We're not saying the Earth doesn't go through routine in the scheme of time.
[01:41:45.261 --> 01:41:46.482]  Routine changes.
[01:41:47.282 --> 01:41:58.330]  So they take changes they're already gauging and then try to stampede people through a panic to accept a world tax for a world government that isn't even a solution to climate change.
[01:41:59.013 --> 01:42:00.154]  Well, that's exactly right.
[01:42:00.295 --> 01:42:06.722]  In fact, the Kyoto Protocol had nothing to do with solving global warming, because they can't solve global warming.
[01:42:07.243 --> 01:42:10.287]  At best, as we've already said, it would reduce the Earth's temperature by 0.15 degrees.
[01:42:12.017 --> 01:42:20.981]  What it does do is it provides the United Nations both a form of income as well as a global income redistribution plan.
[01:42:21.402 --> 01:42:25.284]  It'll be taken out of the developed nations and put into the developing nations.
[01:42:25.964 --> 01:42:29.886]  And it's a massive, massive socialist enterprise in order to shift
[01:42:30.467 --> 01:42:31.847]  We're good to go.
[01:42:58.909 --> 01:43:01.292]  Why does the elite want to destroy the middle class?
[01:43:02.073 --> 01:43:04.155]  Because in the middle class, there's power.
[01:43:04.395 --> 01:43:08.179]  In the middle class, there's the ability for the middle class to control them.
[01:43:09.275 --> 01:43:20.964]  Because if you have a middle class that is powerful, has independence, and its own personal sovereignty and so forth, you have a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and they can't operate under those conditions.
[01:43:21.024 --> 01:43:22.885]  They must have control.
[01:43:23.365 --> 01:43:33.833]  And the only way that they can have control is to create a two-tiered system, basically, of the poor, or the serfs, and the elite, just like we had under the feudal system in the Dark Ages.
[01:43:34.333 --> 01:43:51.562]  Let's speak specifically, because in their own UN documents, in their own Ford Foundation, and Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, and the Pew Foundation, and Nature Conservancy, they say they want a neo-feudalist surf state, and a world population reduction of 80 to 90 percent.
[01:43:51.602 --> 01:43:59.006]  Can you go through neo-feudalism, neo-surf, and speak specifically to those, and what their master plan is, what the world would look like if they succeeded?
[01:43:59.506 --> 01:44:11.721]  One of the things that is very shocking to most Americans is the fact that the United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment, which came out in 1995, clearly shows that in order to protect planet Earth, we have to go back to a feudal system.
[01:44:11.742 --> 01:44:16.788]  They actually said that in the document, because there you have just a few elitists
[01:44:17.711 --> 01:44:30.761]  If you have a middle class, supposedly, then you have so much impact on the Earth with such a demand on Earth's resources and so forth, you cause destruction of biodiversity and all the rest, global warming and so forth.
[01:44:30.781 --> 01:44:32.402]  So we must have a two-tiered system.
[01:44:34.904 --> 01:44:41.749]  So to be specific, they're openly saying that enslavement... I mean, this is their total rationale for being feudal lords, but continue.
[01:44:42.708 --> 01:44:44.890]  So you have a feudal system established.
[01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:50.333]  That's actually stated in this United Nations document called the Global Biodiversity Assessment.
[01:44:51.114 --> 01:44:55.897]  And then they want to reduce the Earth's population on the premise, of course, that we're overpopulating.
[01:44:55.937 --> 01:45:00.740]  The Earth cannot sustain the level of population that we have right now, which is hogwash.
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:12.288]  In fact, study after study after study, even the United Nations, if you go to the United Nations population site and look to see what they actually said, there's 50 billion people and so forth that's been thrown around.
[01:45:13.194 --> 01:45:22.749]  The United Nations says that most will probably wind up between 9 and 11 billion people by 2050, and then it will start to decline and go back to about 6 billion that we have right now.
[01:45:23.070 --> 01:45:25.554]  They admit there was really no population problem.
[01:45:26.235 --> 01:45:32.799]  But they have to create another scare story, and as a consequence, they put out this idea that there are too many people out there.
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:42.125]  The limits of growth and so forth that the Club of Rome put out back in the 1970s says that we're going to run out of resources and so forth, which is hogwash.
[01:45:42.385 --> 01:45:50.690]  Well, what a perfect excuse for would-be tyrants to say that people are the enemy, and then central world government is going to decide how to deal with that threat.
[01:45:50.710 --> 01:45:51.371]  Can you speak to that?
[01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:52.091]  Absolutely.
[01:45:52.111 --> 01:45:53.592]  In fact, the whole environmental movement
[01:45:54.204 --> 01:46:05.611]  That has been orchestrated by the Lucius Trust organization and the various foundations is to convey the idea that we no longer have an enemy on the outside trying to destroy us.
[01:46:06.111 --> 01:46:10.574]  We have defined, as Pogo used to say in his cartoons, we are the enemy.
[01:46:10.974 --> 01:46:16.498]  And therefore, we ourselves have to take actions that will diminish this threat.
[01:46:22.006 --> 01:46:22.727]  Please continue.
[01:46:23.287 --> 01:46:29.991]  And as a result of that, what we're seeing right now is the fact that we need to have a human population reduction.
[01:46:30.111 --> 01:46:47.842]  In fact, the first copy, it doesn't say it in the actual final copy, but in the draft copy of the United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment, it states very clearly that we must reduce the human population from its current level of about 6 billion people down to about 1 billion people.
[01:46:48.302 --> 01:46:50.143]  Then we might be able to save planet Earth.
[01:46:53.215 --> 01:46:56.178]  Dr. Pianca came out and gave speeches here in Texas.
[01:46:56.218 --> 01:46:57.819]  He's a University of Texas professor.
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:08.509]  And he said that we need to have a worldwide police state like China has, and these are quotes, to be able to forcibly carry out world population reduction.
[01:47:08.969 --> 01:47:12.993]  And at meetings where there were over a thousand people, he was giving standing ovations.
[01:47:13.713 --> 01:47:20.059]  You know, it's a, I don't know, it's a psychosis that seems to affect the elites or those who believe that they're elite.
[01:47:20.672 --> 01:47:24.213]  That we are the enemy and we must do something to stop ourselves.
[01:47:24.553 --> 01:47:44.398]  And that is one of the things, and I've actually, Alex, back in my early days, before the environmentalists really knew who I was, I used to go to some of these organizational meetings and so forth, and talk to some of these leaders, and ask them that very question, why is it that you believe that humanity must offer itself up on the altar of nature?
[01:47:44.698 --> 01:47:48.859]  And they would give me the spiel, of course, that we're damaging the earth and its ecosystems and so forth.
[01:47:49.888 --> 01:47:56.174]  Well, if you really believe that, why is it that you don't offer yourself up first on the altar of nature?
[01:47:56.714 --> 01:48:00.858]  And they would just look at me with this blank stare, like it never even occurred to them.
[01:48:01.439 --> 01:48:06.203]  And their typical reaction would be something around the idea, well we need to be here to make sure it gets done right.
[01:48:09.915 --> 01:48:12.197]  This sounds like Control Freaks on steroids.
[01:48:12.297 --> 01:48:12.857]  Yes, it is.
[01:48:13.137 --> 01:48:13.838]  It really is.
[01:48:14.178 --> 01:48:15.219]  Speak to Control Freaks.
[01:48:15.559 --> 01:48:17.560]  Control Freaks have to be able to control.
[01:48:17.620 --> 01:48:23.364]  In fact, the whole globalist agenda is based on the ability of them to control every movement
[01:48:24.248 --> 01:48:32.313]  In fact, in Agenda 21, the United Nations Agenda 21 is built on the premise that at the global level, every human action is controlled.
[01:48:32.594 --> 01:48:50.605]  Now, that doesn't mean they're cognizant of every motion that every human being makes, but we are limited to what we can do to very, very narrow ranges of choices, and therefore, we are controlled on a day-to-day basis, almost on an hour-and-hour basis, what we can do, when we can do it, and how we do it.
[01:48:51.354 --> 01:48:53.336]  This sounds like a control freak paradise.
[01:48:53.496 --> 01:48:53.856]  It does.
[01:48:54.016 --> 01:48:54.757]  It really does.
[01:48:54.897 --> 01:49:00.161]  And that's the tragedy of what we're seeing right now, is that it must be through control.
[01:49:00.902 --> 01:49:05.886]  And in the process, of course, we no longer will be a nation of the people, by the people, and for the people.
[01:49:05.926 --> 01:49:09.049]  We'll be a nation that is controlled by the elite.
[01:49:11.551 --> 01:49:13.012]  Is there a program behind schedule?
[01:49:14.333 --> 01:49:15.674]  Yes it is, and no it's not.
[01:49:16.654 --> 01:49:23.820]  Back in the early 1920s, Alice Bailey had set out in her books a goal for the early 2000s of having this fully implemented.
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:29.584]  In fact, by 2007, that's right now, she thought that this would be in place.
[01:49:30.521 --> 01:49:32.322]  But it doesn't always happen that way.
[01:49:32.342 --> 01:49:39.845]  And the one thing that you have to recognize about this global elite and the Anglo-American faction is, if they suffer setbacks, that's okay.
[01:49:39.905 --> 01:49:43.306]  They'll fall back, reorganize, and try it from a different angle.
[01:49:43.786 --> 01:49:45.027]  And of course, that takes time.
[01:49:45.427 --> 01:49:49.108]  Back when I stopped the Convention on Biological Diversity... Let's talk about that when we get back.
[01:49:49.148 --> 01:49:53.230]  Let's talk about these nature corridors, how they mesh with the toll roads when we get back.
[01:49:56.485 --> 01:50:01.930]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:09.937]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.655 --> 01:50:17.718]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.118 --> 01:50:29.503]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.843 --> 01:50:33.384]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.784 --> 01:50:35.765]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.065 --> 01:50:39.907]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:53.095 --> 01:51:01.359]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.619 --> 01:51:05.961]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.261 --> 01:51:15.185]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.385 --> 01:51:18.987]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.287 --> 01:51:24.312]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.612 --> 01:51:31.319]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.832 --> 01:51:32.493]  What about you?

[01:52:49.143 --> 01:52:51.765]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:52:54.362 --> 01:52:59.504]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.184 --> 01:53:02.505]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:02.525 --> 01:53:09.008]  Dr. Kaufman, you actually mapped.
[01:53:12.726 --> 01:53:23.332]  The United Nations agreement that the bureaucracies are implementing, despite the fact that it was defeated in Congress thanks to your efforts and others, to have large portions of the country off limits or restricted use for humans.
[01:53:23.352 --> 01:53:30.817]  We've laid those over the 83 NAFTA highways, not just I-35, and all the other toll road systems, and they match.
[01:53:32.198 --> 01:53:37.601]  Let's go through how you were able to shoot down at least the official implementation, but how they're now doing it by stealth.
[01:53:38.141 --> 01:53:43.105]  Well, as you've alluded to several times, Alex, once you understand what their agenda is, it's not hard to anticipate what they're going to do next.
[01:53:55.305 --> 01:54:13.194]  As an environmental scientist, I had been following this process as to what is known as the Wildlands Project for a number of years, and realized that in 1992, at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, they were going to put forth this Convention on Biological Diversity, and I knew at that time it was going to be the de facto Wildlands Project.
[01:54:13.234 --> 01:54:24.040]  And the de facto Wildlands Project requires that half of the United States be put into wilderness reserves and corridors, interconnecting corridors, so that you have this mosaic of what looks like a blood system,
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:25.321]  We're good to go.
[01:54:50.874 --> 01:54:54.376]  Clinton did the first few days he was in office and it came into the U.S.
[01:54:54.396 --> 01:54:58.517]  Senate and it was going to come out with a recommendation to ratify.
[01:54:58.838 --> 01:55:00.959]  It was only 18 pages long.
[01:55:01.539 --> 01:55:02.939]  It wasn't even a complete treaty.
[01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:06.221]  They wanted to get the United States to ratify an unwritten treaty
[01:55:07.361 --> 01:55:09.782]  All the verbiage and so forth that was going to be added later.
[01:55:10.182 --> 01:55:11.282]  I knew what it was going to be.
[01:55:11.462 --> 01:55:15.223]  They had the language in there to actually implement the Wildlands Project.
[01:55:15.263 --> 01:55:23.044]  And again, the Wildlands Project calls for putting aside one half of the United States into wilderness or corridors and reserves.
[01:55:23.824 --> 01:55:26.085]  So I drew this map, took it to the U.S.
[01:55:26.105 --> 01:55:33.566]  Senate when it finally came out for a vote in 1994, and to make a long story short, it was so shocking
[01:55:34.258 --> 01:55:37.439]  That they blew this up on a four-by-six-foot poster and took it out on the Senate floor.
[01:55:37.459 --> 01:55:42.880]  It was so shocking that Senator Mitchell, who was the majority leader at that time, withdrew it from the executive calendar.
[01:55:42.920 --> 01:55:43.820]  They never voted on it.
[01:55:45.161 --> 01:55:46.641]  So even the Democrats said no?
[01:55:47.501 --> 01:55:49.302]  Even the Democrats said no, that's correct.
[01:55:49.462 --> 01:55:51.302]  I remember that on television at the time.
[01:55:51.322 --> 01:55:52.282]  Do you have that on tape?
[01:55:52.682 --> 01:55:53.283]  No, I don't.
[01:55:53.343 --> 01:55:55.343]  I wanted to get a hold of the tape, but I never could find one.
[01:55:55.983 --> 01:56:00.484]  And I've seen photos of it in magazines of them up there on the Senate floor with pointers and a big map.
[01:56:00.744 --> 01:56:03.645]  Yes, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson actually took it out on the Senate floor.
[01:56:05.487 --> 01:56:06.208]  It's amazing.
[01:56:06.249 --> 01:56:09.494]  Now, half is off limits, but other areas are restricted as well.
[01:56:09.714 --> 01:56:10.235]  Absolutely.
[01:56:10.315 --> 01:56:18.289]  The rest of the half, according to the Wildlands Project, had to be highly controlled in order to protect the core attributes of the wilderness areas.
[01:56:18.329 --> 01:56:19.251]  In other words, of nature.
[01:56:19.927 --> 01:56:21.308]  And those are members of?
[01:56:37.444 --> 01:56:39.625]  To protect those core environmental attributes.
[01:56:39.665 --> 01:56:43.547]  But isn't that really just an excuse for these controllers to dominate?
[01:56:43.627 --> 01:56:44.147]  Absolutely.
[01:56:44.608 --> 01:56:55.113]  In fact, they were talking about, in the original draft, it talked about having whole communities, whole towns, ripped off of the face of the earth, highways ripped out, and so forth.
[01:56:55.473 --> 01:57:01.816]  So only a few highways remained, and that brings us to the core, to the superhighways that we're talking about here today.
[01:57:02.436 --> 01:57:21.090]  This was actually part of this agenda, I believe, back in 1994, is to divide the world up into little cells, or little human enclaves, as they were called, so that people were isolated from other enclaves, had very little communication or contact with other isolated enclaves, so they didn't know what's going on.
[01:57:21.170 --> 01:57:22.411]  And they have been very effective.
[01:57:22.652 --> 01:57:27.555]  People have been attacked ferociously all across this country, and they think they're by themselves.
[01:57:27.595 --> 01:57:29.217]  They don't realize that it's happened to everyone.
[01:57:29.277 --> 01:57:30.798]  Let's talk about that when we get back.
[01:57:33.527 --> 01:57:36.470]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:36.490 --> 01:57:36.771]  Big Brother.
[01:57:36.791 --> 01:57:37.732]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:37.752 --> 01:57:38.332]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:38.352 --> 01:57:38.713]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.817 --> 01:57:56.698]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.378 --> 01:58:01.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:05.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:21.091 --> 01:58:23.333]  We're back with Dr. Michael Kaufman, Ph.D.
[01:58:25.206 --> 01:58:31.491]  Discussing how he worked within the system, went to these environmental meetings, was involved in the Forest Service, and witnessed it for himself.
[01:58:31.791 --> 01:58:40.378]  I want to get back into the population control agenda from the elite perspective, not just their pantheistic minions out there following their mindless religion.
[01:58:41.358 --> 01:58:51.302]  But going back to the low-level first, I have talked to a lot of the environmentalists, a lot of the locals, and I told them back in the mid-90s, late 90s, I said, look, they're grabbing all these tens of thousands of acres around Austin.
[01:58:51.322 --> 01:58:52.702]  I've been to the Smart Growth Conferences.
[01:58:53.142 --> 01:58:54.023]  I've read the documents.
[01:58:54.123 --> 01:58:54.623]  You haven't.
[01:58:54.663 --> 01:58:56.303]  You're on a feel-good gravy train.
[01:58:56.663 --> 01:58:58.404]  You're getting nothing out of this.
[01:58:58.444 --> 01:59:03.826]  You go and create kind of the rent-a-mob, false view that this is organic.
[01:59:04.685 --> 01:59:12.550]  People are calling for this, but I said the big banks and everybody behind this, they bragged they're grabbing the land to lay it off use to later, just a few years later.
[01:59:13.420 --> 01:59:16.001]  Start building on it, and they should know that'll never happen.
[01:59:16.041 --> 01:59:21.003]  A lot of them now are totally disillusioned and aren't buying into it.
[01:59:21.103 --> 01:59:27.166]  Is that a problem for the globalists that now the core of the environmental movement realizes that they've been involved in a fraud?
[01:59:27.726 --> 01:59:28.346]  Yes and no.
[01:59:28.706 --> 01:59:33.688]  They're being controlled because their money sources, the private foundations, are controlling what their agenda is.
[01:59:33.868 --> 01:59:35.409]  Speak specifically to the environmental groups.
[01:59:35.749 --> 01:59:43.775]  What the Sierra Club, the Nature Conservancy, the major environmental groups of the United States usually have a lot of splinter groups that they're funding.
[01:59:44.295 --> 01:59:48.578]  Again, but it's mostly foundation money or their money that they're getting from the U.S.
[01:59:48.618 --> 01:59:48.999]  government.
[01:59:49.059 --> 01:59:55.944]  The Nature Conservancy, of course, gets literally hundreds of millions of dollars every year through land sales to the federal government.
[01:59:55.964 --> 01:59:58.966]  They buy land cheap because they basically put
[01:59:59.466 --> 02:00:00.147]  We're good to go.
[02:00:18.923 --> 02:00:24.790]  Most people don't realize this, and they want that land primarily not to protect nature.
[02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:27.352]  In fact, the Nature Conservancy is one of the biggest violations.
[02:00:27.433 --> 02:00:33.159]  If there's minerals and so forth on that donated land or land that they've expropriated at a bargain-based price,
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:37.083]  They will turn around and exploit them the same as a landowner would.
[02:00:37.103 --> 02:00:42.147]  Because they come in and buy off the local state governments, the county city governments, and I've seen it right here.
[02:00:42.167 --> 02:00:43.348]  I don't have to travel to see it.
[02:00:43.368 --> 02:00:44.869]  I've seen it all over the nation in the news.
[02:00:45.369 --> 02:00:53.696]  But they come here, they say, oh it's for a park, you can't build, and once they get it for pennies on the dollar, they take the restrictions off, mines, hotels,
[02:00:54.816 --> 02:00:55.517]  It's incredible.
[02:00:55.657 --> 02:01:03.821]  Not on all land purchases or acquisitions and so forth, but on enough of them to make a person realize they're really not there to protect the environment.
[02:01:03.861 --> 02:01:04.981]  They're there to exploit it.
[02:01:05.381 --> 02:01:12.985]  In some cases, they were protected for 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 years until the market is right, and then they'll go in and actually exploit it.
[02:01:13.005 --> 02:01:17.547]  In fact, if you look at where a lot of these reserves and corridors are on the maps that I have produced,
[02:01:18.147 --> 02:01:30.834]  You'll find they're overlaying very well the mineral deposits here in the United States and it would not be a bit surprising once they have control that you know all these environmental limitations and so forth will come off and they'll be exploited.
[02:01:31.294 --> 02:01:37.278]  Now we're kind of seeing the reverse of that also the federal government's being lobbied by these groups and transferring land to their control as well.
[02:01:37.518 --> 02:01:40.199]  Yes, it's happening at every level of government.
[02:01:40.239 --> 02:01:46.523]  I'm working with people at the local government level in which the town government or their city government or their county government
[02:01:47.083 --> 02:01:54.489]  It's basically exploiting the poor people or a portion of the land to get what they want, either for their buddies or for development purposes later on.
[02:01:54.869 --> 02:02:02.335]  It happens at every level of government because you have now a government that no longer has checks and balances, and it's exploiting their citizens.
[02:02:02.835 --> 02:02:07.839]  When we get back, I want to talk about some states are, what, 85% federally or state controlled?
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:10.101]  And they're not stopping there.
[02:02:10.141 --> 02:02:12.603]  They're going for 98% control.
[02:02:13.003 --> 02:02:13.524]  That's correct.
[02:02:14.104 --> 02:02:14.585]  Absolutely.
[02:02:15.889 --> 02:02:18.751]  Nevada, for instance, is 88% federally controlled.
[02:02:18.771 --> 02:02:23.253]  Now, I don't say federally owned because there's a misnomer out there that these are public lands.
[02:02:23.293 --> 02:02:24.434]  They're not public lands.
[02:02:25.074 --> 02:02:31.777]  These lands have all kinds of layers of private property rights on them for grazing, for mining, and so forth.
[02:02:32.258 --> 02:02:40.962]  But the environmental community puts tremendous pressure on Congress, puts tremendous pressure on the federal agencies, and so forth, to withdraw those rights.
[02:02:41.382 --> 02:02:43.724]  And people are being destroyed in the process.
[02:02:43.844 --> 02:02:44.484]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.220 --> 02:02:53.684]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.044 --> 02:03:01.630]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.378 --> 02:03:09.440]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.821 --> 02:03:21.264]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.564 --> 02:03:25.126]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.

[02:05:45.823 --> 02:05:48.024]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.565 --> 02:05:51.366]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:14.297 --> 02:06:16.782]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is our guest.
[02:06:16.802 --> 02:06:20.270]  I want to go back to when you were involved with the Forest Service in the 80s.
[02:06:21.837 --> 02:06:23.719]  You mentioned it earlier, going to these meetings.
[02:06:23.739 --> 02:06:26.320]  I mean, you not only have the UN documents, I've got them as well.
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:30.963]  I've gone to the UN website and gotten them, where they say human sacrifice is a good way to get rid of people.
[02:06:31.044 --> 02:06:32.484]  I have that in my film Road to Tyranny.
[02:06:33.085 --> 02:06:34.846]  I mean, it's just bizarre stuff.
[02:06:35.206 --> 02:06:37.388]  And you tell people this, it just sounds crazy.
[02:06:37.628 --> 02:06:39.429]  But talk about those meetings, what you saw.
[02:06:39.449 --> 02:06:50.396]  Let's talk about the Club of Rome and there's the 1973 Henry Kissinger document, declassified in 92, where they ordered the third world countries to sterilize half their women or not get IMF or World Bank money.
[02:06:51.257 --> 02:06:51.837]  What are the specifics?
[02:06:51.897 --> 02:06:56.280]  This whole eugenics concept has been around for, you know, generations.
[02:06:56.380 --> 02:06:57.080]  It's nothing new.
[02:06:57.701 --> 02:07:00.582]  But it has taken on its own art form here in the last hundred years.
[02:07:00.883 --> 02:07:07.746]  And in World War II, of course, it was really exploited by Adolf Hitler in the concept of building the super race.
[02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:10.128]  And that has not died with Adolf Hitler.
[02:07:10.268 --> 02:07:17.172]  It has still continued on with Prince Philip and his son Prince Charles and all the rest that is going on right now.
[02:07:17.910 --> 02:07:20.451]  That is called sustainable development.
[02:07:21.271 --> 02:07:39.755]  It's not a process in which you see actively the idea of actually changing the genetic structure of the world, but what you're seeing is, in its effect, the destruction of the third world nations, the black communities of Africa and so forth, through this whole concept of sustainable development.
[02:07:39.875 --> 02:07:40.555]  It's ironic.
[02:07:40.595 --> 02:07:46.336]  We've been working inside the United Nations as well, and we're finding that the people that are head of these programs
[02:07:47.399 --> 02:07:47.839]  No, I don't.
[02:08:05.026 --> 02:08:20.648]  Where when I finally get through and lay out the whole global agenda and the environmental side of it, I mean it's huge, but the environmental side of it, all of a sudden these people who are compartmentalized, they only understand a very small percentage of what is really going on.
[02:08:21.494 --> 02:08:21.954]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:08:43.502 --> 02:08:48.506]  The global elite compartmentalizing everything down below it, and it's just like the communist cell system.
[02:08:48.866 --> 02:08:51.388]  You only know your portion of what you're supposed to do.
[02:08:51.448 --> 02:08:53.770]  Now, you don't know that you're being used this way.
[02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:56.892]  You think that you're being used to advance a wonderful agenda and so forth.
[02:08:57.413 --> 02:09:04.098]  But at the same time, they only know a very small portion of what's going on, and they're advancing this in really total ignorance.
[02:09:04.118 --> 02:09:05.699]  They're useful idiots, as Stalin said.
[02:09:07.376 --> 02:09:08.077]  Absolutely.
[02:09:08.917 --> 02:09:32.754]  And again, the average person doesn't think like this about exterminating populations, forced sterilization, and they've been given this positive little pipe dream, fantasy narrative of some global utopia, but you look at the very structure of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and you look at the 31 pieces, it gives you all these great rights, but in 29 and 30, it takes them all away.
[02:09:32.774 --> 02:09:36.697]  It takes them all away, because it's only doled out at the request of the United Nations
[02:09:38.339 --> 02:09:43.445]  Well, that's one of the things that they, in fact, even in our public school systems right now, they'll compare the U.S.
[02:09:43.485 --> 02:09:47.470]  Constitution with the Human Rights Statement of the United Nations.
[02:09:48.010 --> 02:09:52.536]  And the United Nations sounds like it's so much better because it addresses these specific rights.
[02:09:53.194 --> 02:09:59.376]  When in fact, if you go through the last couple of them, what you find is that they only get those rights if the United Nations so deems it.
[02:09:59.797 --> 02:10:01.157]  And therefore they can take them right away.
[02:10:01.197 --> 02:10:08.860]  And it says that anything that threatens the United Nations, and the Secretary General was the grand arbiter, then your rights are null and void.
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:09.380]  That's right.
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:18.224]  In fact, we've attended Sovereignty International, I'm the Executive Director for Sovereignty International, as a 501c3 organization, we've attended many United Nations meetings.
[02:10:18.866 --> 02:10:24.407]  And we used to publish newsletters and so forth, really what was going on behind the scenes at that particular meeting.
[02:10:24.827 --> 02:10:31.149]  And eventually, they said, either you stop publication, or you're no longer going to have accreditations attending these meetings.
[02:10:31.589 --> 02:10:33.229]  And that's the way that we have freedom.
[02:10:33.569 --> 02:10:34.329]  Freedom of the press.
[02:10:34.429 --> 02:10:35.829]  You know, that's their idea of freedom of the press.
[02:10:35.869 --> 02:10:42.151]  Yeah, they claim there's all these NGOs, but if you don't serve their purpose and pair it out, but if you do serve, you get funding.
[02:10:42.171 --> 02:10:43.091]  Speak to the NGOs.
[02:10:43.511 --> 02:10:48.393]  The non-governmental organizations were a brainchild of a guy by the name of Reece Strong back in the early 1960s.
[02:10:48.493 --> 02:10:52.474]  And NGOs have been around a long time.
[02:10:52.494 --> 02:10:53.935]  They're non-governmental organizations.
[02:10:53.975 --> 02:10:59.236]  They're like the Sierra Club or the Socialist Fabian Society, those types of organizations.
[02:11:00.397 --> 02:11:02.477]  And they were exploited.
[02:11:02.817 --> 02:11:10.340]  They realized that they could use these NGOs, create them, fund them, and use them as instruments
[02:11:11.428 --> 02:11:15.029]  Suggests that the whole country or the whole world believes in this kind of thing.
[02:11:15.089 --> 02:11:18.250]  You hear these various things and everybody is in agreement with.
[02:11:18.851 --> 02:11:20.171]  Well, it's all orchestrated.
[02:11:20.691 --> 02:11:21.331]  It's amazing.
[02:11:21.351 --> 02:11:26.413]  If you go back and take it apart, you'll find that every one of these are being funded by the same groups of people.
[02:11:27.163 --> 02:11:35.092]  And they either speak the same message, now they'll use different language to speak that message, but they basically speak the same message, or they don't get funded.
[02:11:35.773 --> 02:11:47.627]  And everybody likes to take a paycheck home so they can feed their family and so forth, so it's unbelievable the power that these non-governmental organizations can have because they're all being controlled by a very small group of funders.
[02:11:48.007 --> 02:11:49.289]  And it's not just the documents.
[02:11:49.389 --> 02:11:50.029]  You've been there.
[02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:51.631]  Go back through that in a nutshell.
[02:11:51.671 --> 02:11:52.572]  Encapsulate it.
[02:11:52.872 --> 02:11:53.913]  That you were going.
[02:11:53.954 --> 02:11:55.055]  You were a member of this.
[02:11:55.175 --> 02:11:59.499]  And as soon as you didn't play ball and reported, this was not some democratic society.
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:02.923]  It's definitely not a democratic society as we understand democracy.
[02:12:03.504 --> 02:12:05.025]  It's a controlled society.
[02:12:05.266 --> 02:12:06.487]  And always understand this.
[02:12:07.128 --> 02:12:14.799]  I cannot overemphasize enough to the listening audience right now how much control they will exert if they have their way.
[02:12:14.999 --> 02:12:18.044]  They definitely want to control every action of our lives.
[02:12:18.524 --> 02:12:21.549]  If you read Agenda 21 and realize what it implicates,
[02:12:22.248 --> 02:12:28.209]  Or implies, in the level of control, you'll understand that they will control every, every aspect of your life.
[02:12:28.769 --> 02:12:33.250]  And they need to do this in order to be able to perpetuate and advance the agenda that they have.
[02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:37.371]  And as a consequence, these meetings, these meetings are already prearranged.
[02:12:37.531 --> 02:12:39.852]  They know what the outcomes are going to be before they go in.
[02:12:40.232 --> 02:12:46.393]  Now, we've had some success back in Johannesburg in 2002 at the World Summit on Sustainable Development.
[02:12:46.413 --> 02:12:49.694]  They wanted to introduce a world religion through consensus.
[02:12:50.470 --> 02:12:51.330]  Now, let's get specific.
[02:12:51.370 --> 02:12:54.211]  Several of my cousins were top of their class.
[02:12:54.231 --> 02:12:55.332]  I wasn't, so I was never approached.
[02:13:20.485 --> 02:13:32.727]  But every public school, and almost every major private school, and my sister went to private school and they had it there, they approach them with model United Nations.
[02:13:32.747 --> 02:13:35.448]  And I've been to this, I put it in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:13:35.748 --> 02:13:41.329]  And they teach them, we're going to end hunger, we're going to help the poor, we're going to love everybody, it's going to be happy, we'll have a global tax to fix it.
[02:13:41.869 --> 02:13:48.050]  So all over Europe, all over the US, all over Canada, all over the world, from Japan to China to the US, every
[02:13:49.329 --> 02:13:55.971]  Valedictorian, Salutatorian, the top 10% of the honor roll is recruited into model United Nations.
[02:13:56.411 --> 02:14:02.113]  And people who push world government say, well that's the next step, it will no more war, we'll all be friends, we'll all have this freedom.
[02:14:02.513 --> 02:14:10.175]  And they don't know that it's codified, that it's command and control, with no liberty, no freedom, total tyranny within the systems.
[02:14:10.215 --> 02:14:18.858]  Can you speak to the model United Nations and the recruiting of the colleges, and then to the fact of your research on what this world government will look like?
[02:14:19.429 --> 02:14:22.472]  Well, actually it's going to go back, like you say, a hundred years.
[02:14:23.152 --> 02:14:27.856]  It was over a hundred years ago they began to try to control the public education system in the United States.
[02:14:27.916 --> 02:14:31.159]  First at the college level so that they can control what the teachers are being taught.
[02:14:31.799 --> 02:14:41.848]  So that they then take it with total ignorance usually, sometimes they know what they're doing, but most of us in total ignorance take it down to the primary level and the secondary system and so forth.
[02:14:42.586 --> 02:14:46.787]  But it started back in the early 1900s, to begin to indoctrinate.
[02:14:46.807 --> 02:14:53.789]  It wasn't until my generation, and I'm over 60 years old, it wasn't until my generation that it began to really start to bear fruit.
[02:14:54.249 --> 02:14:55.970]  That's when the counterculture movement hit.
[02:14:56.290 --> 02:15:07.273]  There was a number of things that came together at that time, both in the Vietnam War, they were able to, because they had control over the media, that's one thing we haven't talked about, they literally had control over the media.
[02:15:07.593 --> 02:15:11.234]  The media at that time was basically owned by about 12 different families.
[02:15:12.129 --> 02:15:21.352]  And these people that were reporters were basically brought up in an educational system in which they were indoctrinated to see that this socialistic approach was the correct way to go.
[02:15:21.792 --> 02:15:26.714]  They didn't even have to be told what to write because of their socialistic education and so forth.
[02:15:27.034 --> 02:15:30.075]  They actually just wrote it because they knew that was reality.
[02:15:30.395 --> 02:15:35.897]  And of course, the rest of the population was beginning to begin to see this socialistic approach was the right way to go.
[02:15:36.017 --> 02:15:37.317]  And I don't even use the word socialist.
[02:15:37.357 --> 02:15:39.018]  I know you need to use it to communicate that
[02:15:40.238 --> 02:15:44.440]  That symbol to people, but I just call it a consolidation approach.
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:48.181]  The consolidation approach is a worldview, really, what it amounts to.
[02:15:48.881 --> 02:15:54.143]  And they've been docketing us with this worldview so that when you hear it on the news, it sounds right.
[02:15:54.975 --> 02:16:03.265]  And therefore, a lot of people, even though they weren't involved in the counterculture movement or the New Age movement back in the 60s and 70s, they agreed with his fundamental principles.
[02:16:03.445 --> 02:16:04.226]  Well, here's an example.
[02:16:04.386 --> 02:16:09.992]  Every Miss America, every Miss USA says, World Peace, United Nations, carbon tax.
[02:16:10.453 --> 02:16:10.713]  Yes.
[02:16:11.354 --> 02:16:11.915]  Because
[02:16:12.695 --> 02:16:20.778]  If you believe in that, then you believe that if we just could get all of this consolidated so that everybody was on the same page, then we would have a Tolkien world.
[02:16:21.219 --> 02:16:23.880]  Of course, it will never happen, but that's what they believe.
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:36.345]  Now, over and over again in UN documents and Council on Foreign Relations documents and Bilderberg documents in the North American Union Summit they had last year secretly in September in Canada, they say, government, world government by stealth, integration by stealth.
[02:16:37.205 --> 02:16:39.686]  I mean, they admit this is all a secret program.
[02:16:40.228 --> 02:16:47.065]  Yes, it's still, even with the American people halfway down the road to this worldview that they want to perpetuate, it's still
[02:16:47.955 --> 02:16:54.216]  There's enough of the mentality of freedom and understanding of freedom that they cannot openly discuss this.
[02:16:54.876 --> 02:16:57.897]  If they openly discussed it, the American people would stand up and say no.
[02:16:58.137 --> 02:17:06.379]  And that's what we're trying to accomplish here, is to educate the American people that this is dangerous, what is really happening, because they want a total totalitarian government.
[02:17:06.759 --> 02:17:12.260]  And they believe, understand this, most of these world leaders believe that they are right.
[02:17:13.624 --> 02:17:16.046]  That we need to be led by them.
[02:17:16.246 --> 02:17:17.787]  They're the only ones that have the right answers.
[02:17:17.827 --> 02:17:21.350]  We cannot be allowed to make our own decisions because we'll muck things up.
[02:17:22.173 --> 02:17:25.135]  They really believe this, and therefore they need total control.
[02:17:25.476 --> 02:17:31.200]  But these globalists have been in control, and all they do, look at the fruits they bear, is total destruction and enslavement.
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:33.182]  Well, there's two things going on there.
[02:17:33.662 --> 02:17:34.723]  First of all... We've got a break.
[02:17:34.803 --> 02:17:36.584]  Let's come back and get into that also later.
[02:17:36.604 --> 02:17:38.946]  I want to play this past year clip from Lou Dobbs.
[02:17:38.966 --> 02:17:39.947]  Get your comments on that.
[02:17:40.307 --> 02:17:43.109]  Dr. Michael Kaufman, just we could talk for ten hours.
[02:17:43.149 --> 02:17:44.170]  This is such a big subject.
[02:17:44.450 --> 02:17:44.891]  Yes, it is.
[02:17:45.652 --> 02:17:49.236]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:17:49.276 --> 02:17:49.777]  are located?
[02:17:49.977 --> 02:17:53.362]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:17:53.602 --> 02:17:58.308]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:17:58.588 --> 02:18:03.595]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:18:03.835 --> 02:18:04.416]  We're good to go.
[02:18:23.439 --> 02:18:23.939]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:51.262]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:51.722 --> 02:18:59.484]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:59.845 --> 02:19:07.687]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:08.007 --> 02:19:12.748]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:13.088 --> 02:19:17.809]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:22.170]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:19:22.650 --> 02:19:23.670]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:27.831]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:19:41.755 --> 02:19:47.617]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.097 --> 02:19:52.739]  Did you know there's a secret group that wants the government to spend itself in the bankruptcy?
[02:19:53.099 --> 02:19:59.381]  Did you know that current President Bush has the largest percentage of increase in spending than any Democrat has ever had?
[02:19:59.401 --> 02:20:02.962]  38% higher than Bill Clinton's highest budget.
[02:20:03.582 --> 02:20:12.887]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:52.961 --> 02:20:57.445]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.

[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:24.063]  We'll also refer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.
[02:21:24.303 --> 02:21:26.424]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[02:21:26.764 --> 02:21:34.428]  Find out why mangosteen is known as the queen of all fruits and why it is fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[02:21:34.748 --> 02:21:36.109]  Your health is in your hands.
[02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:37.510]  Do something about it today.
[02:21:37.530 --> 02:21:37.890]  Call 800-681-1909.
[02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:38.291]  Again, that's 800-681-1909.
[02:21:38.311 --> 02:21:39.692]  Oh, I really should have built a wall.
[02:22:00.478 --> 02:22:05.307]  Welcome back, Dr. Michael Kaufman.
[02:22:10.592 --> 02:22:11.593]  He's our guest in studio.
[02:22:11.613 --> 02:22:13.475]  You know, I had two pages of notes.
[02:22:13.495 --> 02:22:15.356]  We've covered about half the first page.
[02:22:15.436 --> 02:22:16.537]  And we were just talking during break.
[02:22:17.037 --> 02:22:25.605]  You've got like, you know, ten times the information that's out that's just in your World Events and Prophecy, a great DVD available at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:26.425 --> 02:22:29.268]  I mean, there is just so much happening.
[02:22:29.288 --> 02:22:30.369]  We have so much proof.
[02:22:30.409 --> 02:22:33.511]  I call it an orgy of evidence because we just drowned in it.
[02:22:33.531 --> 02:22:34.172]  They write books.
[02:22:34.192 --> 02:22:34.972]  They have think tanks.
[02:22:35.032 --> 02:22:35.913]  It's in their laws.
[02:22:35.953 --> 02:22:36.474]  They admit it.
[02:22:37.114 --> 02:22:39.955]  And then people are starting to wake up, but not fast enough.
[02:22:39.995 --> 02:22:40.795]  Not fast enough.
[02:22:40.876 --> 02:22:43.276]  I mean, is this... just sum up for us.
[02:22:43.396 --> 02:22:44.377]  What is world government?
[02:22:44.457 --> 02:22:45.677]  What is the master plan?
[02:22:45.757 --> 02:22:46.818]  What is their worldview?
[02:22:47.118 --> 02:22:49.379]  What will the world look like if they have their way, Doctor?
[02:22:49.639 --> 02:22:52.440]  They will actually control the world through a tiered system.
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:57.882]  They want to establish a central government, either in the United Nations or an organization like the United Nations,
[02:22:58.502 --> 02:23:13.417]  But then they want to have regional enclaves in which you have regional forms of government like the emerging North American Union, like the European Union, like Mercure down in South America, like ASEAN and China and so forth.
[02:23:13.977 --> 02:23:15.398]  That will serve two levels.
[02:23:15.599 --> 02:23:28.309]  One is economic control, where the economy is controlled by a subgroup within the overall world government that controls what happens in those four, five, or ten nations, whatever is part of that regional government.
[02:23:28.329 --> 02:23:29.130]  The kings of the earth.
[02:23:29.250 --> 02:23:29.971]  The kings of the earth.
[02:23:30.031 --> 02:23:37.457]  In fact, that was brought out by the Club of Rome back in 1973 in a book called Regionalize and Adapt the Model for the Global World System.
[02:23:38.115 --> 02:23:40.777]  He has published a book in which they call the Ten Kingdoms.
[02:23:41.278 --> 02:23:47.023]  The Ten Kingdoms will be dividing the world's economy up into ten regions where they have a lot of self-control.
[02:23:47.063 --> 02:23:48.384]  And then the sub-units are the same.
[02:23:48.464 --> 02:24:00.174]  Ten regions to the U.S., ten regions to the three blocks of the North American Union, ten regions to the Pan American Union, ten regions to the European Union expanding into Asia, ten regions to the Asian Union.
[02:24:00.194 --> 02:24:01.475]  You get down to states.
[02:24:01.895 --> 02:24:10.160]  They're in ten regions, in blocks, then you get into the counties, they're in five to ten regions, and they transfer the power to non-elected boards.
[02:24:10.480 --> 02:24:13.082]  Basically, that's what we need to be really concerned about.
[02:24:13.102 --> 02:24:21.446]  We no longer have a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, in which the leaders are accountable directly to the people through the electoral process.
[02:24:21.967 --> 02:24:24.148]  They will be controlled by bureaucracies.
[02:24:24.688 --> 02:24:30.353]  Well, take the IMF, the World Bank, take the World Health Organization, take the World Trade Organization.
[02:24:30.673 --> 02:24:35.557]  Congress has given it more of its authority than it still retains, and the thing was only set up in the mid-1990s.
[02:24:35.757 --> 02:24:36.398]  That's right.
[02:24:36.418 --> 02:24:37.619]  Can you speak to that?
[02:24:37.739 --> 02:24:39.120]  Yeah, actually we have a system.
[02:24:39.160 --> 02:24:43.964]  In fact, Joseph Stiglitz, which was the Vice President of the World Bank, finally gave up in frustration and quit.
[02:24:44.514 --> 02:24:52.137]  Because he said this group, this IMF especially, but the World Bank too, is not there to promote individual freedom and wealth for individuals.
[02:24:52.217 --> 02:24:54.657]  It's there to carve out its own power structure.
[02:24:55.238 --> 02:25:01.099]  And the very things that they're designed to do is causing these third world nations to collapse.
[02:25:01.119 --> 02:25:04.901]  You know, the United Nations talks about all of this development of the third world nations.
[02:25:05.541 --> 02:25:08.822]  There's no hope for it, because they're not giving them private property rights, which is
[02:25:09.062 --> 02:25:09.943]  Absolutely essential.
[02:25:09.983 --> 02:25:10.983]  They don't want independence.
[02:25:11.023 --> 02:25:12.824]  They do not want them to be independent.
[02:25:13.184 --> 02:25:21.569]  They'll give all this mouthpiece and so forth, but then deny the nations the actual ability to create wealth for itself, and power, and sovereignty.
[02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.831]  It's amazing.
[02:25:24.591 --> 02:25:34.357]  So if they were able to succeed, what year would you say we'd finally... I mean, it's already happening right now, but what year would it be final if we weren't able to stop them and slow them down, and what would life be like?
[02:25:35.120 --> 02:25:46.490]  Alice Bailey, if you read Alice Bailey's occult work, I remember Alice Bailey wrote 26 books, not by herself, but by her occult master, called by Dole Hall, Ascendant Master, supposedly.
[02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:49.272]  And they set the... Let's be clear, the U.N.
[02:25:49.312 --> 02:25:51.494]  officially says their plan was channeled.
[02:25:51.774 --> 02:25:53.496]  Their plan was channeled, that's correct.
[02:25:54.257 --> 02:25:58.861]  And they hope to have everything fully in place in the midnight, well, the teens, the 2010 to 2015, 2020.
[02:26:04.293 --> 02:26:05.073]  We're right there.
[02:26:05.473 --> 02:26:07.234]  We're not far away from it right now.
[02:26:07.514 --> 02:26:09.335]  We're talking about global one-child policies?
[02:26:09.415 --> 02:26:09.635]  Yes.
[02:26:10.455 --> 02:26:22.439]  I really do think they'll have to precipitate this with some sort of cataclysmic event in order to get the people to do it, but I think it's very possible within the next few years of seeing those really come together very quickly.
[02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:26.822]  So what would it be like for an average person living under this?
[02:26:27.243 --> 02:26:33.949]  The average person living under this in the United States would have their standard living reduced by anywhere from 30 to 50 percent at a minimum.
[02:26:34.189 --> 02:26:35.050]  Maybe more than that.
[02:26:35.190 --> 02:26:37.332]  Because you no longer have a free market.
[02:26:37.812 --> 02:26:42.337]  You're working within a controlled market and a controlled market can never anticipate humans' needs.
[02:26:42.937 --> 02:26:48.601]  It's done by bureaucracy, and bureaucracy can never project what the humanity is going to need in the next decade or so.
[02:26:48.641 --> 02:26:50.342]  They'll try to say they can, but they can't.
[02:26:50.542 --> 02:26:53.504]  And they're telling us we're going to reduce our population's standard of living.
[02:26:53.665 --> 02:26:53.885]  Right.
[02:26:53.965 --> 02:27:04.072]  In fact, the global biodiversity assessment called for this in the next 50 years, to reduce our population by up to 70 to 80 percent in the next 50, maximum 100 years.
[02:27:04.092 --> 02:27:07.954]  So you're talking about massive, massive reductions in the human population.
[02:27:08.375 --> 02:27:09.916]  Again, mostly in
[02:27:10.476 --> 02:27:16.678]  The Africa, South America, and a lot of the nationalities and so forth that they believe are genetically inferior.
[02:27:18.859 --> 02:27:26.382]  Meanwhile, you've got Bill Gates and Ted Turner and Prince Philip all involved in programs for special vaccines for the black children.
[02:27:26.422 --> 02:27:32.844]  Yes, unfortunately, and as many have discovered, some of those vaccines actually cause more problems than they create.
[02:27:33.004 --> 02:27:33.924]  Let's break that down.
[02:27:33.944 --> 02:27:34.705]  Let's break that down.
[02:27:35.505 --> 02:27:36.405]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.885 --> 02:27:38.406]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.424 --> 02:27:42.185]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.465 --> 02:27:49.066]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:27:49.326 --> 02:27:50.186]  Look no further!

[02:28:19.744 --> 02:28:26.266]  And believe strongly that the American people need alternative sources of information in order to understand the society they live in today.
[02:28:26.486 --> 02:28:29.547]  You won't find a better selection of books or videos anywhere.
[02:28:29.727 --> 02:28:32.568]  So make Northern Voice Bookstore your bookstore!

[02:28:40.431 --> 02:28:42.951]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[02:28:42.991 --> 02:28:48.113]  Shelly, you make a... Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[02:28:48.575 --> 02:28:50.756]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:28:51.256 --> 02:28:55.738]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:28:55.918 --> 02:28:58.359]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:28:58.619 --> 02:28:59.819]  I think it's something like that.
[02:28:59.839 --> 02:29:02.240]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[02:29:02.380 --> 02:29:05.282]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:29:05.322 --> 02:29:07.122]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:29:07.242 --> 02:29:09.503]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:29:09.883 --> 02:29:10.504]  I guess you're right.
[02:29:10.884 --> 02:29:11.564]  Why don't we try it?
[02:29:11.744 --> 02:29:13.705]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:29:14.136 --> 02:29:18.538]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:29:18.819 --> 02:29:20.199]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:29:20.580 --> 02:29:24.942]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:29:25.182 --> 02:29:28.484]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[02:29:34.787 --> 02:29:36.088]  The BedFan is the answer.

[02:29:48.133 --> 02:29:48.473]  Hello?
[02:29:48.653 --> 02:29:49.653]  Hey, it's me.
[02:29:49.673 --> 02:29:51.894]  I got something, man, I want you to look at.
[02:29:52.334 --> 02:29:52.614]  What?
[02:29:53.054 --> 02:29:53.795]  What is it now?
[02:29:54.215 --> 02:29:56.696]  It's called OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:29:57.196 --> 02:29:59.937]  When you get home, I want you to go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:30:00.017 --> 02:30:01.397]  Come on, you gotta be kidding.
[02:30:01.797 --> 02:30:02.898]  One year to retire?
[02:30:03.138 --> 02:30:05.879]  When are you gonna get it through your head that there is no quick fix?
[02:30:06.219 --> 02:30:06.879]  No free lunch?
[02:30:07.469 --> 02:30:07.709]  I know.
[02:30:08.089 --> 02:30:08.850]  I agree with you.
[02:30:08.990 --> 02:30:09.950]  This isn't like that.
[02:30:10.511 --> 02:30:14.133]  It's an ingenious system that's designed to help you retire in one year.
[02:30:14.153 --> 02:30:19.636]  I was skeptical too, but the system is free, and when I looked at it, I was sure it would work.
[02:30:20.256 --> 02:30:21.117]  What have you got to lose?
[02:30:21.157 --> 02:30:21.677]  It's free.
[02:30:22.117 --> 02:30:27.120]  Well, all you have to do is go to OneYearToRetire.net and get a free system.
[02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:28.681]  It only takes a minute.
[02:30:28.881 --> 02:30:31.042]  You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
[02:30:31.702 --> 02:30:33.623]  Go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:30:34.144 --> 02:30:35.605]  That's OneYearToRetire.net.
[02:30:36.872 --> 02:30:37.333]  Or call 888-200-0265.
[02:30:37.393 --> 02:30:37.853]  That's 888-200-0265.
[02:30:38.273 --> 02:30:40.195]  Come, you masters of war.
[02:30:40.255 --> 02:30:42.297]  Here to build the big guns.
[02:30:42.337 --> 02:30:44.419]  Here to build the death planes.
[02:30:45.580 --> 02:30:48.503]  Here to build all the bombs.
[02:31:05.703 --> 02:31:06.983]  Is it hide behind walls?
[02:31:07.944 --> 02:31:11.845]  Is it hide behind desks?
[02:31:14.166 --> 02:31:18.207]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[02:31:20.728 --> 02:31:22.549]  You that never done nothing.
[02:31:25.451 --> 02:31:29.014]  Dr. Michael Kaufman is going to be here with us the next few days.
[02:31:29.034 --> 02:31:30.355]  We're doing intensive interviews with him.
[02:31:30.375 --> 02:31:33.777]  We appreciate him graciously coming down to Texas to be in my new film.
[02:31:33.797 --> 02:31:38.680]  He's going to be one of the main individuals in the documentary we're making about the Globalist Master Plan.
[02:31:38.721 --> 02:31:40.202]  And we've just flat run out of time here.
[02:31:40.222 --> 02:31:44.064]  We've got about 10 minutes left because I promised to get more into Building 7 and the big developments there.
[02:31:44.084 --> 02:31:45.765]  I'm sorry we haven't had time to take calls today.
[02:31:46.106 --> 02:31:49.308]  I haven't even been plugging my documentaries or InfoWars.com or how you can only
[02:31:49.748 --> 02:31:55.661]  Get his film, World Events and Prophecy, and much more at InfoWars.com because this information is so important.
[02:31:55.921 --> 02:31:57.404]  But please be sure and support us.
[02:31:57.825 --> 02:32:00.110]  Dr. Cobham, before we go any further, also give out your website.
[02:32:00.703 --> 02:32:04.326]  The website is www.discerningtoday.org.
[02:32:04.506 --> 02:32:06.788]  That's discerningtoday.org.
[02:32:06.828 --> 02:32:14.755]  And if you missed that driving around in Kansas City or upstate New York or San Diego or Chicago, just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:32:14.795 --> 02:32:17.678]  We've got it up on the main page as our featured guest today.
[02:32:17.698 --> 02:32:21.501]  You can just go to InfoWars.com and visit Dr. Michael Coffin's incredible site.
[02:32:21.902 --> 02:32:25.505]  I want to thank you for letting us use your maps and documentation and research.
[02:32:25.985 --> 02:32:27.446]  Yeah, it was one of the things that
[02:32:46.173 --> 02:32:49.935]  I think really upset the globalists when his book actually got out.
[02:32:49.975 --> 02:32:53.057]  He wrote a 1300 page book called Tragedy and Hope.
[02:32:53.177 --> 02:32:56.898]  He's a historian, he's a renowned, one of the foremost historians of the 20th century.
[02:32:56.978 --> 02:33:00.480]  Wasn't he pretty much the head at one time of the political science department at Georgetown?
[02:33:00.700 --> 02:33:01.781]  At Georgetown, yeah.
[02:33:02.361 --> 02:33:04.442]  He was one of the foremost historians.
[02:33:04.482 --> 02:33:05.683]  Bill Clinton's top mentor.
[02:33:05.763 --> 02:33:05.943]  Right.
[02:33:06.543 --> 02:33:09.805]  And he actually had insight into what was going on.
[02:33:09.865 --> 02:33:11.006]  He was part of the big boys.
[02:33:11.046 --> 02:33:14.348]  He actually agreed with his global elite and what they were trying to do.
[02:33:14.428 --> 02:33:20.972]  He really believed that the United States average citizen didn't know what was good for them, and they had to be led by the nose by different people.
[02:33:21.032 --> 02:33:22.933]  And so he had access to their records.
[02:33:23.073 --> 02:33:25.935]  Actually, they provided his records for years, several years.
[02:33:25.955 --> 02:33:27.415]  He said that he was given access to them.
[02:33:27.456 --> 02:33:27.676]  Right.
[02:33:28.136 --> 02:33:29.697]  And so he had total access.
[02:33:30.297 --> 02:33:36.739]  And what he came up with was really a promo for the Global Elite, but it was only supposed to be known by the Global Elite.
[02:33:36.759 --> 02:33:42.882]  And then it got out, the John Birch Society found out about it, and people started to buy it just to find out what the Global Elite was really up to.
[02:33:42.922 --> 02:33:44.882]  And he spelled it out, page by page.
[02:33:44.922 --> 02:33:46.163]  And then they stopped publication.
[02:33:46.243 --> 02:33:52.425]  And then they stopped publication, and actually took all the existing books off the bookshelves and tried to get back the books that were actually purchased.
[02:33:52.925 --> 02:33:54.485]  So that those books would no longer be there.
[02:33:54.525 --> 02:33:58.767]  And I have to admit, I've gone off online footnotes when I first read it about 12, 15 years ago.
[02:33:58.787 --> 02:33:59.107]  I don't remember.
[02:33:59.127 --> 02:33:59.947]  It was a long time ago.
[02:34:00.447 --> 02:34:01.207]  I didn't read the whole thing.
[02:34:01.247 --> 02:34:03.488]  It's almost 1,000 pages, depending on how much volume.
[02:34:03.608 --> 02:34:04.188]  Over 1,000 pages.
[02:34:04.348 --> 02:34:04.588]  Over 1,000.
[02:34:05.208 --> 02:34:06.209]  And I did read about 500.
[02:34:06.569 --> 02:34:08.769]  And it's just, it's incredible elitism.
[02:34:09.109 --> 02:34:11.470]  It is unbelievable arrogant elitism.
[02:34:12.259 --> 02:34:13.520]  But he does tell the truth.
[02:34:13.540 --> 02:34:21.689]  I mean, he's very open about what's going on, because this was supposed to be a historical background of how the world was transisted from state governments, i.e.
[02:34:21.749 --> 02:34:24.252]  nations and so forth, to a global government.
[02:34:24.592 --> 02:34:29.558]  This is what his intention was, and he was actually writing this as a historical account of this effort.
[02:34:30.126 --> 02:34:35.371]  And on page 324, I want to say this because I think it's important to realize we're not making this stuff up.
[02:34:35.812 --> 02:34:52.808]  This guy had primary access to these records, and he says that the powers of the financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in the private hands, able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
[02:34:53.449 --> 02:34:54.390]  And he goes on to say,
[02:34:55.111 --> 02:34:56.914]  You know what, I don't like rushing you.
[02:34:56.934 --> 02:34:58.257]  Folks, we're going to do Monday's show.
[02:35:09.767 --> 02:35:12.068]  The entire show on Building 7 and 9-11.
[02:35:12.689 --> 02:35:13.729]  I'm suspending that for now.
[02:35:13.749 --> 02:35:15.350]  We're going to do the rest of the show.
[02:35:15.791 --> 02:35:19.673]  The 22 minutes and 30 seconds we've got left on this because this is too important.
[02:35:20.093 --> 02:35:21.574]  Because I don't like having to rush you here.
[02:35:22.255 --> 02:35:23.836]  Let's continue.
[02:35:24.996 --> 02:35:27.858]  He says in there also, and I have these quotes in my book, dissent and tyranny.
[02:35:28.118 --> 02:35:28.298]  Yeah.
[02:35:28.418 --> 02:35:30.179]  He says that people get confused.
[02:35:30.199 --> 02:35:31.980]  They think it's communism, they think it's capitalists.
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:32.200]  No.
[02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:34.721]  It's a consolidation world empire movie.
[02:35:34.741 --> 02:35:36.101]  He calls it the Roundtable Groups.
[02:35:36.441 --> 02:35:43.044]  He explains that people get confused by CFR, Bilderberg, Trilateral Commission, all these groups.
[02:35:43.084 --> 02:35:43.704]  He says, no, no, no.
[02:35:44.004 --> 02:35:52.888]  These are all just different management nodes of the same central system being implemented over the different national blocks, economic blocks,
[02:35:53.710 --> 02:35:59.196]  Religious blocs, and he says they work with fascists, they work with communists, they work with anyone who consolidates.
[02:35:59.236 --> 02:35:59.977]  So please speak to that.
[02:36:00.297 --> 02:36:02.039]  It will literally work to everything.
[02:36:02.079 --> 02:36:03.941]  He spells this all out in his book.
[02:36:04.001 --> 02:36:09.227]  He basically says that they will do what it takes in every government.
[02:36:09.267 --> 02:36:15.534]  In fact, he actually talks about the fact that these groups actually helped promote the Soviet Union.
[02:36:16.649 --> 02:36:26.056]  He doesn't go into the books of how they promoted Hitler's rise to power and so forth, but there are other documents that show that we funded Hitler's rise to power.
[02:36:26.557 --> 02:36:29.839]  These same globalists... Well, it was John D. Rockefeller.
[02:36:29.859 --> 02:36:38.425]  I have the New York Times articles from the 20s and 30s where they were saying eugenics was good, and he actually funded the main Nazi eugenics program that was carried out.
[02:36:38.566 --> 02:36:39.066]  Absolutely.
[02:36:39.306 --> 02:36:41.127]  I mean, this is mainstream information.
[02:36:41.187 --> 02:36:42.708]  This is nothing that's really secret.
[02:36:43.049 --> 02:36:52.555]  Although, people will say it's conspiracy stories now, but the fact is that Congress held investigations on this because we were funding Hitler during World War II.
[02:36:52.595 --> 02:37:03.242]  And then they tried to hire Smedley Butler to overthrow the presidency and set up a fascist dictatorship in the 30s, and there were congressional hearings on that, and that's all going in the new film.
[02:37:03.282 --> 02:37:04.103]  Can you speak to that?
[02:37:04.143 --> 02:37:05.283]  I mean, they're not playing games.
[02:37:05.464 --> 02:37:08.245]  No, they're not playing games, and we need to understand, back up until the 1950s,
[02:37:09.866 --> 02:37:13.287]  There were a lot of congressional hearings that finally got buried.
[02:37:13.507 --> 02:37:14.467]  I mean literally buried.
[02:37:14.487 --> 02:37:17.668]  If you bring them up now, they'll say it's not factual and so forth and so on.
[02:37:18.268 --> 02:37:28.751]  But these congressional hearings basically showed, and the senators and the congressmen at the time were deathly afraid of this emerging power structure from the banking community.
[02:37:29.404 --> 02:37:29.924]  We're good to go.
[02:37:48.556 --> 02:37:49.918]  That these kinds of things happen.
[02:37:49.938 --> 02:37:59.592]  In fact, there were testimonies, it is in books right now, where people that were leading these committees were basically threatening, if you don't change what you're saying, you're going to die.
[02:37:59.692 --> 02:38:00.053]  Period.
[02:38:00.313 --> 02:38:01.475]  That's just the way it is.
[02:38:03.340 --> 02:38:05.262]  Well, people ask why they don't kill us today.
[02:38:05.322 --> 02:38:06.202]  They're more arrogant.
[02:38:06.403 --> 02:38:07.964]  They weren't killing people back then.
[02:38:08.024 --> 02:38:15.951]  Yes, because they were still trying to get... they have enough control now where we're just little minor peons that are out there trying to piss on this problem.
[02:38:16.651 --> 02:38:17.972]  And they know that they're going to win.
[02:38:18.032 --> 02:38:26.980]  What they don't know is that God can somehow spoil all of this if he wants to, and we've demonstrated that several times by totally interrupting their agenda and setting it back five to ten years.
[02:38:27.140 --> 02:38:28.841]  Well, Nineveh got a hundred year reprieve.
[02:38:29.942 --> 02:38:31.544]  And I think that's what we're doing right now.
[02:38:31.564 --> 02:38:34.886]  And it's up to you and I. We have to get involved in this in order to stop it.
[02:38:34.946 --> 02:38:38.109]  We just can't sit back on our sofas and say, wring our hands and say, it's horrible.
[02:38:38.549 --> 02:38:39.790]  We need to start taking action.
[02:38:39.850 --> 02:38:42.112]  We need to be able to find out this information.
[02:38:42.452 --> 02:38:47.577]  Get involved in your local community governmental affairs, your town, city, county, whatever the case is.
[02:38:47.597 --> 02:38:51.280]  Write letters to your congressmen and senators and so forth.
[02:38:51.320 --> 02:38:54.382]  Don't be nasty because they'll discount you if you're nasty.
[02:38:54.402 --> 02:38:59.106]  But say that you're very concerned about this, like the North American Union right now.
[02:39:00.180 --> 02:39:03.043]  They basically say, why is this being done in secret?
[02:39:03.104 --> 02:39:05.686]  Why isn't Congress involved in these decisions?
[02:39:05.767 --> 02:39:08.770]  Why is this being done in a stealth mode?
[02:39:09.411 --> 02:39:13.475]  And get them to start holding congressional hearings and so forth on what's going on.
[02:39:13.576 --> 02:39:16.018]  I mean, we have bombshell information.
[02:39:16.078 --> 02:39:18.481]  In fact, do you have that clip of Lou Dobbs?
[02:39:18.521 --> 02:39:19.863]  I want to play that since we have time now.
[02:39:20.620 --> 02:39:32.147]  This is Lou Dobbs, ladies and gentlemen, last night with Pasteur, who's one of the top technicians who simply carries out the program and then he develops a plan.
[02:39:32.187 --> 02:39:37.030]  He brags towards the North American Union, towards the North American community, let's do it by stealth.
[02:39:37.050 --> 02:39:38.571]  Do you have that Lou Dobbs clip last night?
[02:39:39.451 --> 02:39:40.812]  Here is Lou Dobbs last night.
[02:39:40.852 --> 02:39:42.153]  Let's write notes on this, Doctor.
[02:39:42.513 --> 02:39:45.315]  I want your comments on it when it finishes up here in a moment.
[02:39:46.016 --> 02:39:51.977]  Two years ago, the Council on Foreign Relations published a report titled, Building a North American Community.
[02:39:52.697 --> 02:40:08.301]  Among the goals expressed, to break down trade regulations between the United States and Canada, between Canada and Mexico, and of course, then the United States, but without congressional approval, or certainly without congressional oversight, or voter approval.
[02:40:08.901 --> 02:40:14.542]  Critics call the plan the North American Union, and many say that it would ultimately destroy U.S.
[02:40:14.582 --> 02:40:15.002]  sovereignty.
[02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:19.301]  Robert Pastor is a member of the group that wrote the original report.
[02:40:19.681 --> 02:40:20.822]  He joins us tonight.
[02:40:20.862 --> 02:40:22.022]  It is good to have you with us.
[02:40:22.422 --> 02:40:23.142]  Thank you very much.
[02:40:23.882 --> 02:40:42.008]  Robert Pastor, you were co-chairman of an independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations, and in this report titled, Building a North American Community, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, Richard Haass, states, quote, The task force's central recommendation is establishment by 2010.
[02:40:43.624 --> 02:40:45.665]  Well, the United States, Canada, and Mexico now are already
[02:41:03.737 --> 02:41:05.738]  The largest free trade area in the world.
[02:41:05.998 --> 02:41:08.439]  And we have 800 billion dollars worth of trade.
[02:41:09.259 --> 02:41:26.165]  This is a source of comparative advantage for the United States, but the Council report feels that we could take greater advantage if we deepen economic integration, if we can secure ourselves better, not only at our borders, but also by thinking about a continental security perimeter as well.
[02:41:27.134 --> 02:41:38.716]  Why would you think about, just out of curiosity, a common security perimeter when the United States does not have secure ports, nor does it have anything approaching secure borders?
[02:41:39.697 --> 02:41:56.120]  Well, it's precisely because our ports are not secure and our borders are not secure that we need to find not only better ways to do that, but also better ways to turn our two neighbors into partners to enhance our security and to
[02:41:56.600 --> 02:41:58.141]  Enhance our prosperity as well.
[02:41:58.521 --> 02:42:00.683]  And that can't be done with sovereign nations?
[02:42:00.743 --> 02:42:08.147]  There has to be integration of an economy, a customs union, if you will, and a common security perimeter?
[02:42:08.607 --> 02:42:25.537]  I think the vision defined in that report is one of three sovereign nations cooperating with each other to deepen economic integration, to create a common external tariff, to improve our economies and to secure ourselves better.
[02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:30.013]  Let me ask you, the Banff meeting in September of last year.
[02:42:31.174 --> 02:42:31.975]  You were there, weren't you?
[02:42:32.295 --> 02:42:32.635]  I was.
[02:42:33.376 --> 02:42:43.465]  And representatives of all three governments, military, business, economic ministers, and commerce officials.
[02:42:44.326 --> 02:42:46.188]  Why was the press not permitted to be there?
[02:42:47.483 --> 02:42:58.532]  Well, there were press in the room, but the leaders of the three groups decided that they wanted to keep the discussions active and vigorous and therefore confidential.
[02:42:58.572 --> 02:43:10.482]  My personal view is that I would have preferred for the meeting to have issued a statement or report afterwards, and I hope that if the group comes together again that they'll do that.
[02:43:11.542 --> 02:43:13.843]  Under what authority are they coming together?
[02:43:14.503 --> 02:43:15.563]  Oh, it was a conference.
[02:43:16.003 --> 02:43:16.583]  I'm sure you attended.
[02:43:16.603 --> 02:43:17.363]  No, I know it's a conference.
[02:43:17.423 --> 02:43:18.623]  I'm asking what authority.
[02:43:19.444 --> 02:43:35.327]  I think the three leaders, one was George Shultz from the United States, Peter Lockheed, the former Premier of Alberta, Pedro Aspe, former Minister of Finance of Mexico, just assembled a group of about 75 people, 25 from each country.
[02:43:35.787 --> 02:43:37.127]  Just willy-nilly got together?
[02:43:37.913 --> 02:43:38.233]  Oh, yes.
[02:43:38.333 --> 02:43:41.396]  Don't you attend conferences from time to time to learn about the world?
[02:43:42.297 --> 02:43:49.522]  No, I prefer, frankly, to learn about the world through travel, my reporting, my reading and studying.
[02:43:50.823 --> 02:43:58.970]  The fact of the matter is I really have an aversion to conferences altogether, but I know that some people make a living on them.
[02:43:59.390 --> 02:44:00.591]  Who is paying for all of this?
[02:44:01.716 --> 02:44:03.297]  Well, I was not organizing that.
[02:44:03.337 --> 02:44:06.560]  You'll have to get to the organizers of the conference.
[02:44:06.620 --> 02:44:11.344]  I think foundations, there may have been some corporate sponsorship as well.
[02:44:11.384 --> 02:44:12.505]  I was just invited to it.
[02:44:12.765 --> 02:44:13.746]  Right.
[02:44:13.866 --> 02:44:20.631]  You also are considered by many to be the architect of this North American Union or Competitor's Council as it's coming forward.
[02:44:22.593 --> 02:44:26.116]  I'd like to ask you something I found rather curious in the North American Forum.
[02:44:27.176 --> 02:44:40.541]  Saying, while a vision is appealing, working on the infrastructure might yield more benefit and bring more people on board.
[02:44:41.201 --> 02:44:42.801]  Evolution by stealth.
[02:44:43.742 --> 02:44:53.505]  Why should anyone in this country, Mexico or Canada, presuming they're interested in the sovereign rights and power of their respective nations,
[02:44:54.179 --> 02:44:57.806]  Well, I'm not sure what you mean by elitist nonsense.
[02:45:06.065 --> 02:45:06.605]  Well, go ahead.
[02:45:07.546 --> 02:45:26.936]  The fact of the matter is that government relations are defined by our Constitution and this is an attempt to integrate economies with approval of the elected officials of the country and without transparency of any kind or consideration of the part of the elites who are combining behind this idea.
[02:45:27.516 --> 02:45:35.560]  We have a North American Free Trade Agreement with very specific methodologies and appropriate processes.
[02:45:35.900 --> 02:45:37.101]  It goes on for several other minutes.
[02:45:37.121 --> 02:45:39.783]  It's up on JonesReport.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:45:39.803 --> 02:45:45.007]  There's so many facets to this, but I have the Judicial Watch documents I read last week.
[02:45:45.027 --> 02:45:46.048]  They got the FOIA request.
[02:45:46.408 --> 02:45:48.429]  The meeting opened with how to keep this secret.
[02:45:48.470 --> 02:46:05.062]  The meeting opened when we have the text of how to keep it secret, of how to implement this without the public knowing, and then Pasteur goes on the air and tries to pooh-pooh that, but then this North American security perimeter, a week after 9-11, eight days after, on Nightline, they have the UN head of peacekeeping saying,
[02:46:05.868 --> 02:46:12.772]  North American Union, continental security perimeter with international I-4 troops protecting it, and free flow within that.
[02:46:13.433 --> 02:46:19.436]  So, their answer is, we're not going to give you internal borders, national borders, we're going to give you international borders.
[02:46:19.857 --> 02:46:30.403]  Speak to the judicial watch warriors that have come out, and then can you speak to what's happening with this continental security perimeter and his comments about evolution by stealth.
[02:46:31.129 --> 02:46:36.534]  Well, I think evolution by itself is how they've been doing almost everything that you find today in the global agenda.
[02:46:37.134 --> 02:46:37.995]  They don't tell you.
[02:46:38.455 --> 02:46:45.021]  Most people would be shocked to find out what is really going on behind the scenes, the things that they thought that they were pretty well informed on.
[02:46:46.462 --> 02:46:47.824]  Those are just the surface issues.
[02:46:47.904 --> 02:46:56.091]  When you really get down into things deeply, you'll find that the whole thing is designed to bring about more and more power to the global level.
[02:46:56.698 --> 02:47:04.860]  And this whole concept of regionalization that we're talking about right now with the emerging North American Union and the SPP and so forth, actually has been started.
[02:47:04.920 --> 02:47:09.141]  It started back with the Club of Rome back in 1973, very quietly.
[02:47:09.541 --> 02:47:11.422]  This was not intended to get out to the general public.
[02:47:11.482 --> 02:47:17.683]  It was supposed to be read by the elite and so forth in the various documents that the Club of Rome published back in those days.
[02:47:18.483 --> 02:47:21.304]  And they divided the world up into ten different regions.
[02:47:22.190 --> 02:47:22.470]  That is
[02:47:43.178 --> 02:47:57.506]  Let's be clear, the Bilderberg Club of Rome, they actually set the policy that it's up to CFR to come up with the actual implementation.
[02:47:57.646 --> 02:47:58.086]  That's correct.
[02:47:58.146 --> 02:48:01.208]  And of course, the CFR at its core is the roundtables.
[02:48:01.801 --> 02:48:08.966]  And the roundtables will set up many, well, in 1921 here in the United States, to control what is going on.
[02:48:09.006 --> 02:48:13.449]  And again, most of the members of the CFR don't have a clue as to what that organization is really doing.
[02:48:13.630 --> 02:48:21.856]  It's more of that compartmentalization, like little pieces of a Lego set, and each person builds, each group builds one Lego, but then together, that's why their symbol's a pyramid.
[02:48:21.896 --> 02:48:23.377]  It's the symbol of compartmentalization.
[02:48:23.437 --> 02:48:24.597]  That's absolutely right.
[02:48:25.018 --> 02:48:30.622]  And what we're seeing right now is through this regionalization, the gradual accumulation of power, and remember,
[02:48:31.582 --> 02:48:35.248]  This is happening without any elected officials being involved.
[02:48:35.328 --> 02:48:41.158]  And that's exactly what this world government is going to be, is that there will be no elected officials involved.
[02:48:41.358 --> 02:48:43.222]  It's these private bodies.
[02:48:43.262 --> 02:48:44.404]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:48.636 --> 02:48:54.103]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.463 --> 02:49:02.073]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.785 --> 02:49:09.848]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.248 --> 02:49:21.673]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.973 --> 02:49:25.495]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.935 --> 02:49:27.876]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.196 --> 02:49:32.038]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:56.836 --> 02:51:59.519]  Final segment, Dr. Michael Kaufman is our guest.
[02:51:59.579 --> 02:52:00.860]  Again, thank you for joining us.

[02:52:31.736 --> 02:52:32.196]  Treason.
[02:52:32.617 --> 02:52:39.742]  I mean, it's a no-brainer that for an executive branch and for the State Department to be openly merging.
[02:52:40.142 --> 02:52:43.524]  Texas businesses have already gotten their new tax ID for North American Union.
[02:52:44.285 --> 02:52:49.489]  We have the SPP documents that have been ordered to be released and have been released, where it's all about stealth.
[02:52:49.749 --> 02:52:50.589]  This is racketeering 101.
[02:52:51.050 --> 02:52:51.750]  This is criminal.
[02:52:52.431 --> 02:52:55.072]  But in your words, is this treason?
[02:52:55.233 --> 02:52:57.534]  And then, how can we defeat this?
[02:52:57.614 --> 02:52:58.395]  Will we defeat this?
[02:52:58.835 --> 02:53:04.901]  You know, every congressman, every military man has to take an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States.
[02:53:05.321 --> 02:53:19.015]  If there was anything that's more anti-constitutional, it's this North American Union concept, the SPP, of forming these bilateral agreements with international implications without even voting on it.
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:21.641]  It's horrifying, and it's treasonous.
[02:53:21.661 --> 02:53:23.461]  There is no question that it's treasonous.
[02:53:23.942 --> 02:53:31.965]  And even Congress back in the 1940s, 50s, and so forth, when we still had the freedom to say it, was telling the people that this is treason.
[02:53:32.485 --> 02:53:37.647]  Until they finally shut up, because no congressman now can get elected without the money from these global elites.
[02:53:37.667 --> 02:53:48.631]  Well, there are congressmen and women that go to the North American Union summits and these official governmental confabs, and then when people call their office they'll say, it doesn't exist, NAFTA highways don't exist,
[02:53:49.151 --> 02:53:49.952]  None of it exists.
[02:53:50.093 --> 02:53:52.876]  And then, meanwhile, they're actually signatories to this.
[02:53:52.896 --> 02:53:53.837]  They're actually pushing this.
[02:53:54.118 --> 02:53:54.618]  Absolutely.
[02:53:54.658 --> 02:53:58.003]  That's many, many people in Congress, both on the Senate and House side.
[02:53:58.624 --> 02:53:59.004]  We're good to go.
[02:54:21.539 --> 02:54:29.805]  They're also stampeding to hand over all of their legitimate authority, because they're public servants elected by us, to these international bodies.
[02:54:29.845 --> 02:54:37.730]  And under treaty, it's clear, and we have Supreme Court justices in USA Today saying that they're going to take now the higher authority as world courts.
[02:54:38.190 --> 02:54:51.279]  I mean, can you speak to the justices and others openly handing over authority and claiming, in a treasonous fashion, that there is an international group above them?
[02:54:52.199 --> 02:55:04.928]  Basically, the Supreme Court, at least five of the judges right now in the Supreme Court, are saying that we no longer should uphold the Constitution of the United States and we should adapt our legal model after those of the world, at the world global level.
[02:55:05.648 --> 02:55:12.853]  And they're the ones that actually voted in 2005 for the Kelo versus New London case that stripped the U.S.
[02:55:12.893 --> 02:55:14.754]  Constitution of its just
[02:55:16.809 --> 02:55:23.332]  Just Compensation Clause and the Use Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States.
[02:55:23.392 --> 02:55:27.214]  We no longer have for public use in the Constitution of the United States.
[02:55:27.314 --> 02:55:28.955]  It's for a public benefit.
[02:55:29.075 --> 02:55:32.296]  It's a private interest to come in and buy our politicians and do that.
[02:55:32.396 --> 02:55:33.277]  Is that not treason?
[02:55:33.457 --> 02:55:40.440]  That is very treasonous because no longer is the average American protected by the Constitution.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:46.466]  It's only, we're vulnerable to whoever has the most money to pay off the government and so forth.
[02:55:46.966 --> 02:55:48.268]  This is treason in our face.
[02:55:48.548 --> 02:55:51.371]  It's treason in our face, in the most diametric way.
[02:55:51.451 --> 02:55:59.459]  I just cannot believe that anyone who has got any historical knowledge of why this country was created and why we have one of the most powerful economies
[02:55:59.859 --> 02:56:00.579]  We're good to go.
