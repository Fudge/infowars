[00:00:05.968 --> 00:00:10.151]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:11.652]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.373 --> 00:00:13.313]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.954 --> 00:00:17.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:22.199]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:37.785]  I am fired up today!
[00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:40.026]  It is the twelfth day of December 2007.
[00:00:40.146 --> 00:00:45.330]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:53.255]  We're going to be joined for a full hour by Ron Paul's son, Rand Paul.
[00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:56.757]  And we're going to be talking about the philosophy of liberty.
[00:00:56.797 --> 00:00:58.499]  A little bit of background on Ron Paul.
[00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.639]  I'm going to dig it out of him.
[00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:00.960]  Some stories about his daddy.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.041]  Maybe some things
[00:01:03.044 --> 00:01:15.649]  You haven't heard out there about the Congressman and also the blimp that's set to launch in the next few days, as well as the Ron Paul blimp tour the East Coast, as the money bomb coming up Sunday.
[00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.070]  It is all coming up today.
[00:01:19.091 --> 00:01:21.952]  Virus starts like a cold, but can be a killer.
[00:01:22.012 --> 00:01:24.333]  MSNBC, new form of
[00:01:25.806 --> 00:01:28.947]  Virus is spreading, but level of threat is unknown.
[00:01:29.047 --> 00:01:31.748]  It targets young and healthy people.
[00:01:31.768 --> 00:01:34.769]  That's who it's most deadly acting upon.
[00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:42.951]  Also, this came out, 9-11 victims lawyers blast ground zero toxic air lies in court.
[00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:54.015]  As the truth, the full magnitude of the cover-up, how they premeditatedly didn't even try to give the firefighters, police, and emergency workers the protective breathing apparatus that they needed.
[00:01:55.638 --> 00:02:02.262]  Former CIA interrogator, we carried out torture because the White House told us to do so, ordered us to do so.
[00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.303]  We already have the memos and the orders.
[00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:09.526]  We already knew this, but now they're testifying in Congress to this, and we have some clips coming up.
[00:02:09.586 --> 00:02:17.750]  One of those clips, Guantanamo legal advisor, Brigadier General, refuses to say that Iranians waterboarding Americans would be tortured.
[00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.432]  They're saying, not going to answer that question.
[00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:25.026]  Well, it's in the CIA training manual as torture.
[00:02:25.526 --> 00:02:30.569]  It's in the 500-year-old French Inquisition manuals.
[00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.710]  It's torture.
[00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.332]  Housing slump damages state revenue, report states.
[00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:43.334]  Now, we covered this a few weeks ago when it first broke, but now we're seeing some of the aftermath.
[00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:51.157]  As states are told, hey, that AAA corporate paper you bought, those government investments and private investments, that stuff's toilet paper.
[00:02:52.054 --> 00:03:05.486]  And they're even telling them now that they can't give them all their money back, despite the fact that the contracts they signed with them stated that if it was improperly rated, they could cash out for the original amount they put in.
[00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:10.930]  Also, a great story from truthnews.us by Kurt Nemo that I want to try to spend some time covering.
[00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:18.537]  DARPA's control freak technology going over some of these systems they're putting in place across the planet.
[00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:42.528]  But first off, when we get back, when Texas Governor Rick Perry this year went to Istanbul, Turkey to meet with the Bilderberg Group for their, what, 54th meeting, when he traveled there, we pointed out that any time someone is... only a few guests are brought each year.
[00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:47.752]  About 110 are actually elite members of Bilderberg, another 15 or so are guests.
[00:03:47.812 --> 00:03:48.893]  It's a big deal.
[00:03:50.334 --> 00:04:05.258]  And that with Gordon Brown, with Tony Blair, with Bill Clinton, with George Herbert Walker Bush, if you get taken there while you're a Congressman or Member of Parliament or a Governor, you are going to be El Presidente, or they are going to push you for El Presidente.
[00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:09.679]  And we pointed this out, and now it's in the news.
[00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.400]  Not Rick Perry running for President, Rick Perry for Vice President.
[00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:20.919]  So, we're going to be discussing this, and he gave a speech yesterday.
[00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:32.547]  I have the transcript here, and he said, uh, well, since there's no Texan on the ballot, we've had so many Texans run for president or been president, I think it's New York's turn.
[00:04:32.607 --> 00:04:34.108]  That's why I'm for Giuliani.
[00:04:35.048 --> 00:04:38.431]  Mr. Anti-gun, pro-open borders, pro-abortion.
[00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.533]  And then he said, well, Ron Paul's running, and you're not going to endorse him?
[00:04:42.554 --> 00:04:44.595]  And he said, no, and walked off the podium.
[00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:55.768]  So that is all coming up, and now it turns out that Pretty Boy is lined up to be Giuliani's running mate.
[00:04:56.408 --> 00:04:59.030]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.772 --> 00:05:03.173]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.193 --> 00:05:05.294]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.015 --> 00:05:10.198]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[00:05:16.506 --> 00:05:18.969]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.119]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:35.031]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.491 --> 00:05:38.992]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.352 --> 00:05:41.873]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.073]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:43.853]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.873 --> 00:05:44.934]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.154 --> 00:05:45.914]  They're after policy.
[00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:47.134]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:05:47.274 --> 00:05:51.796]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:05:52.036 --> 00:05:55.477]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:05:58.758 --> 00:05:59.879]  You have been warned.
[00:06:18.387 --> 00:06:18.947]  I think so.
[00:06:37.978 --> 00:06:38.378]  I think so.
[00:07:00.552 --> 00:07:02.033]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:07:02.394 --> 00:07:07.898]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:16.325]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:20.449]  The package contains 6 DVDs that contain 10 different programs.
[00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:24.350]  Two books that combined are over a thousand pages and other information.
[00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.790]  Order now at our website, mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.971]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:07:32.271 --> 00:07:36.132]  The last word monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:07:36.472 --> 00:07:36.932]  Or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:07:36.952 --> 00:07:37.152]  That's 1-800-275-1126.
[00:07:37.172 --> 00:07:39.353]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:07:50.655 --> 00:07:54.358]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:07:54.398 --> 00:07:59.421]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:08:02.804 --> 00:08:08.828]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.449 --> 00:08:12.431]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.402 --> 00:08:28.852]  We're about to plunge directly into vital news and information across the planet right here in the United States and from right here in Austin deep in the heart of Texas where we're transmitting to you from concerning Lord Perry.
[00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:36.137]  I do just want to encourage everybody that UPS has now told us because of the huge volume of Christmas
[00:08:36.721 --> 00:08:36.941]  I think so.
[00:08:54.278 --> 00:08:59.019]  In places like Alaska, because it ships out of Texas, and we have a map actually hanging on the wall there.
[00:08:59.439 --> 00:09:01.700]  Four or five states around us, it's one day.
[00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.781]  And then states around that, it's two days.
[00:09:03.841 --> 00:09:05.341]  And some of the French states, it's three days.
[00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:06.761]  And in Alaska, it's four days.
[00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:10.823]  But they're saying it can take up to two more days than that on average.
[00:09:10.863 --> 00:09:13.183]  So, it might take one day normally in Texas.
[00:09:13.243 --> 00:09:13.983]  It might take three.
[00:09:14.764 --> 00:09:18.645]  It might take, say, if you're in Nebraska, it might take normally three days.
[00:09:18.705 --> 00:09:19.425]  It might take five.
[00:09:20.747 --> 00:09:25.691]  So you need to get your orders in by Sunday night at midnight.
[00:09:26.092 --> 00:09:34.919]  And we're going to be working here Saturday and Sunday, the little elves there in the InfoWars command center to ship all this out to you.
[00:09:35.419 --> 00:09:41.024]  And everything that comes in through Sunday midnight, they're going to bust their hind ends and ship it all Monday.
[00:09:41.965 --> 00:09:44.467]  And then if orders come in Tuesday, they're going to try to ship it all Tuesday.
[00:09:45.307 --> 00:09:47.229]  We've gotten up to the day of shipping now.
[00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:53.816]  And the two books we got back-ordered in the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:09:54.336 --> 00:09:57.497]  The debunking, 9-11 debunking, that just came in this morning.
[00:09:58.117 --> 00:10:04.859]  Monday, the Bilderberg books came in, plus a bunch of extras so we can fill the back orders there and get all your orders out now.
[00:10:05.259 --> 00:10:08.940]  So we do have the Bilderberg, Club Bilderberg book that is out of stock everywhere.
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:10.260]  Go to Amazon, it's out of stock.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.220]  We have it.
[00:10:11.681 --> 00:10:13.181]  We're shipping it now.
[00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:19.265]  And so, if you get your order in today, the next few days, we shouldn't be sold out by then though, it's going quick, this thing's hot.
[00:10:20.185 --> 00:10:21.666]  You will get it before Christmas.
[00:10:22.306 --> 00:10:23.847]  Again, let's say you ordered Sunday night.
[00:10:24.328 --> 00:10:25.428]  It ships Monday.
[00:10:26.869 --> 00:10:28.910]  Even in Alaska, you should get it by Friday.
[00:10:28.971 --> 00:10:30.692]  If not, it'll be Monday, the day before Christmas.
[00:10:31.832 --> 00:10:34.234]  So, I guess UPS also delivers on Saturdays.
[00:10:34.254 --> 00:10:35.234]  You'll probably get it that Saturday.
[00:10:35.254 --> 00:10:39.337]  But if you live anywhere else in the U.S., piece of cake, or why not just
[00:10:40.097 --> 00:10:44.319]  Not worry about it, and order now so it ships out this week.
[00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:49.240]  Order now, ladies and gentlemen, and it's shipping out this week for all U.S.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.721]  customers.
[00:10:50.081 --> 00:10:56.563]  If you're Canadian, you've got until really Friday to order to ensure you get it, and that's with UPS.
[00:10:57.023 --> 00:11:01.065]  If you're ordering Postal Service, if your order goes in today, you've got a chance to get it before Christmas.
[00:11:01.345 --> 00:11:04.426]  The Postal Service, even though we ship priority, is just horrible.
[00:11:06.008 --> 00:11:26.553]  If you want Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, or Loose Change, Final Cut, or Club Bilderberg, the latest edition, or if you want Infowars, the music of Endgame and Terrorstorm, only $9.95, or you want the film, Terrorstorm's Final Cut, big fat link, topofprisonplanet.com.
[00:11:27.193 --> 00:11:34.575]  I'll tell you right now, I don't get off into the whole massive, you know, pagan side of Christmas with Santa Claus and the rest of it.
[00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:41.754]  Well, I think my wife has snuck in wicked snowmen and snowmen cakes and things in the house, which I don't mind eating.
[00:11:42.175 --> 00:11:45.977]  But the point is, it's a great reason to educate people.
[00:11:46.037 --> 00:11:52.682]  It's a great reason to give them an endgame, to give them a loose change final cut, to give them a Club Bilderberg.
[00:11:53.102 --> 00:11:56.724]  And Christmas is also a wonderful time to remember Jesus and His birth.
[00:11:57.285 --> 00:12:00.547]  And at the same time, to also spend time with your family.
[00:12:01.167 --> 00:12:02.728]  And should you give them a $20 tie?
[00:12:04.406 --> 00:12:06.929]  Or should you give them a $10.95 in-game?
[00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:10.132]  You can get it that low, discounted, in some of the packages.
[00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:12.755]  Should you give them a loose-change Final Cut?
[00:12:12.835 --> 00:12:15.618]  Or should you give them a bottle of wine?
[00:12:15.638 --> 00:12:18.141]  It'll give them a DWI.
[00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:23.146]  Should you give them a sweater that costs $50 and that they won't wear?
[00:12:23.546 --> 00:12:25.328]  Or should you give them a $5.95 American Dictators?
[00:12:27.905 --> 00:12:29.389]  Now is the time!
[00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.293]  The InfoWar is on!
[00:12:31.634 --> 00:12:33.999]  Go to InfoWars.com today!
[00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:34.821]  Order!
[00:12:36.036 --> 00:12:39.978]  The documentary films, order the books, the videos, look at all the specials we've got.
[00:12:40.298 --> 00:12:42.479]  Or call the toll free number and ask them about different specials.
[00:12:42.699 --> 00:12:43.539]  There's like 20 of them.
[00:12:43.979 --> 00:12:45.860]  Several of them are special Christmas specials.
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.821]  And they're just this month.
[00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:48.901]  You can ask them about that.
[00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:51.202]  They can answer all your questions and take your order at 888-253-3139.
[00:12:51.222 --> 00:12:51.402]  888-253-3139.
[00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:56.064]  And I'm not buying anybody anything for Christmas unless it's
[00:13:03.207 --> 00:13:06.089]  Water filters, which I always give to people that don't have them in the family.
[00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:09.531]  Though I've given them to everybody now.
[00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:11.452]  Or if it's documentary films and books.
[00:13:12.232 --> 00:13:13.713]  I do not go out and fight the crowds.
[00:13:13.753 --> 00:13:16.214]  I do not go out and have the security guards pat me down.
[00:13:16.234 --> 00:13:20.737]  I do not go out and run the gauntlet of the traffic and people snatching and grabbing junk.
[00:13:21.277 --> 00:13:22.037]  It's been wonderful!
[00:13:22.498 --> 00:13:23.498]  I haven't been shopping!
[00:13:24.399 --> 00:13:28.341]  Other than ordering some books and videos that my family doesn't already have.
[00:13:29.105 --> 00:13:34.227]  And sending a micro FM transmitter to some family that wanted to put one up.
[00:13:35.988 --> 00:13:38.149]  And that was a little $1,500 gift.
[00:13:39.149 --> 00:13:40.850]  But that's the InfoWar, isn't it?
[00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:42.451]  That's what I do.
[00:13:42.491 --> 00:13:47.733]  That's what I spend my time and my money and my energy on, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:48.313 --> 00:13:53.615]  And so, again, in closing, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:13:54.656 --> 00:13:55.836]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:18.306]  All 17 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, hundreds of my weekly TV reports, hundreds of special in-studio interviews, thousands of audio interviews, and now the servers are so high-powered, the last six months of stuff we've put up there is just crystal clear, almost as good as DVD.
[00:14:18.526 --> 00:14:24.568]  Before that it's high quality, and then you go back three plus years ago, it's still better than Google or YouTube, but it's not very good.
[00:14:24.588 --> 00:14:25.568]  We've got a project now to
[00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:30.793]  Put all the old videos and tapes and shows up in the new super high quality.
[00:14:31.413 --> 00:14:33.154]  I mean, it's at four times T1.
[00:14:33.194 --> 00:14:36.155]  That's how fast, if you've got systems that fast, you can download or stream it.
[00:14:37.095 --> 00:14:40.457]  It's in high, medium, and low in three different formats.
[00:14:40.637 --> 00:14:44.498]  And I mean, you can hardly tell it's not DVD in the highest quality.
[00:14:44.798 --> 00:14:47.119]  I mean, it is such a great tool.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.341]  And PrisonPlanet.tv, I just want to thank all the members of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:14:55.245 --> 00:14:57.487]  For their support, we couldn't do what we're doing without it.
[00:14:57.627 --> 00:15:13.221]  I couldn't expand the websites, I couldn't have hired Kurt Nemo, I couldn't have Steve Watson and Paul Watson and Ryan Slick Eisen and Aaron Dykes and Mike Nelson and Trey Kincaid and all the other people that are in here.
[00:15:13.241 --> 00:15:22.229]  I don't know if they want their names on there, but Amanda and, of course, Michelle and Weldon Henson and Dwayne Cooch.
[00:15:23.144 --> 00:15:24.465]  And I could just continue.
[00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:31.612]  The whole team wishes you a wonderful Christmas and a safe holidays that we've now entered the depths of here.
[00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:37.597]  And just everybody should be careful out there on the roads with all the drunks and the checkpoints and Big Brother and the rest of it.
[00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:40.280]  But PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:15:41.861 --> 00:15:46.165]  Fifteen cents a day, $5.95 a month, the cost of two cups of coffee for your membership.
[00:15:47.316 --> 00:15:51.798]  Get a yearly membership for the month of December and get five plus months free.
[00:15:51.818 --> 00:15:55.679]  You pay for 6.7 months and you get 5.3 months free.
[00:15:56.059 --> 00:15:58.760]  You cannot beat this deal.
[00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:01.962]  And it is the number one source in the info war out there.
[00:16:02.202 --> 00:16:07.324]  And you can just download or burn to disk, the CD, all my films, everything.
[00:16:07.724 --> 00:16:09.785]  It is an armory in the info war.
[00:16:10.405 --> 00:16:12.526]  It is waiting for you now to use it.
[00:16:13.446 --> 00:16:15.167]  Okay, I just spent five minutes on that.
[00:16:15.207 --> 00:16:15.727]  The point is,
[00:16:16.394 --> 00:16:24.738]  I also want to thank, I've got all these new affiliates and I get so busy that we don't post our affiliates.
[00:16:24.898 --> 00:16:25.779]  You know why we don't do that?
[00:16:25.819 --> 00:16:33.703]  Because people in the past have done a few national campaigns where they call up and harass them, four or five phone calls.
[00:16:33.743 --> 00:16:37.245]  It's not a big deal, but we just don't like to have our stations get bugged.
[00:16:37.265 --> 00:16:39.686]  We want you to promote them locally if you're listening to them.
[00:16:40.086 --> 00:16:41.927]  Also, other competing networks
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.341]  I don't think so.
[00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:02.810]  1330 a.m.
[00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:04.452]  I live in South Austin.
[00:17:04.632 --> 00:17:12.017]  That thing's in Cameron, and it comes in a little scratchy in South Austin, clear in North Austin, crystal clear in Waco.
[00:17:12.337 --> 00:17:18.282]  Past Waco, I can visit family in Freestone County in East Texas, east of I-45 and listen to it.
[00:17:18.842 --> 00:17:20.564]  I want to tell everybody about that.
[00:17:20.924 --> 00:17:21.384]  1330 a.m.
[00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:26.128]  Same folks that own KCAA that blasts into San Diego and Los Angeles.
[00:17:27.303 --> 00:17:28.203]  Wonderful people.
[00:17:28.243 --> 00:17:31.144]  Tell everybody in Central Texas about 1330 AM.
[00:17:31.244 --> 00:17:33.265]  I was just listening to that last week.
[00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:39.286]  I'm like, they also carry Gary Brown-filled options and some other stuff, so we're very, very thankful for that.
[00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:39.907]  Okay, I'm done.
[00:17:40.107 --> 00:17:40.867]  I'm done ranting.
[00:17:41.647 --> 00:17:44.068]  I'm done going off to the deep end on all this.
[00:17:45.508 --> 00:17:46.508]  Here's what's going on.
[00:17:49.509 --> 00:17:55.551]  Governor Rick Perry didn't go to Bilderberg Group to tell them about
[00:17:56.414 --> 00:17:57.275]  Federalism.
[00:17:57.656 --> 00:17:59.838]  That's what his press release stated.
[00:17:59.858 --> 00:18:10.531]  It signals a new phase of arrogance by these haughty individuals when they go on C-SPAN and call for new world order and world government, where they
[00:18:11.437 --> 00:18:22.079]  We released some of the first documents from the Bilderberg Group to the BBC three years ago, going, yeah, we set up the European Union in 49, and then officially set it up in 57.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.440]  Yeah, we run things.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.120]  Yeah, we're setting up the North American Union.
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:28.221]  But then if you say you don't like it, we say you're crazy, and it doesn't exist.
[00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:37.263]  Remember, Bilderberg didn't exist, and then it was in the Statesman, Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, and CNN, and local TV all over the state.
[00:18:38.194 --> 00:18:42.837]  And all those millions of people that heard that nut talk about that imaginary group.
[00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:47.981]  I remember 12 years ago on radio, getting calls going, can I have cheese on that Builder Burger?
[00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:50.563]  I don't know why that's the joke people always throw at her.
[00:18:51.023 --> 00:18:53.585]  Can I have some tomatoes on that Builder Burger?
[00:18:53.765 --> 00:18:54.545]  Ha ha ha!
[00:18:54.706 --> 00:18:55.926]  You're nuts, man!
[00:18:56.407 --> 00:18:57.968]  There ain't no secret groups!
[00:18:59.375 --> 00:19:01.816]  America's run by us, the people, yeah!
[00:19:02.156 --> 00:19:09.017]  That's why every major poll, we're against open borders, war, New World Order, but they just still cram it down our throat, both parties, right, Jack?
[00:19:10.198 --> 00:19:11.898]  You can put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:19:12.438 --> 00:19:14.219]  I'm desperately trying to save this country.
[00:19:14.579 --> 00:19:17.900]  I'm talking about real stuff, and you people that laugh at us better wake up!
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.941]  Alright, I'm digressing, I apologize.
[00:19:25.561 --> 00:19:27.522]  So, going back to what I was saying there,
[00:19:29.446 --> 00:19:38.671]  That haughty creature, that Jezebel, Rick Perry... I know Jezebel means a woman.
[00:19:38.811 --> 00:19:39.371]  I understand that.
[00:19:39.391 --> 00:19:40.312]  I've used that on purpose.
[00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:43.894]  Well, we'll tell you what that Jezebel is up to when we get back.
[00:19:45.134 --> 00:19:45.695]  That's right.
[00:19:45.715 --> 00:19:53.078]  We're talking about him doing something very special with a particularly nasty individual.
[00:19:53.138 --> 00:19:57.681]  So we'll be breaking it down on the other side in detail.
[00:19:58.527 --> 00:20:01.228]  And then we got three guests today as well.
[00:20:02.048 --> 00:20:03.449]  Today there's a for Midas December 12, 2007.
[00:20:03.509 --> 00:20:06.390]  Gold 814.50 ounce gold coins can be purchased for 838.95, 413.45 per half, 206.73 per quarter.
[00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:06.670]  That's 838.95, 406.45, 206.73.
[00:20:16.403 --> 00:20:19.104]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[00:20:19.144 --> 00:20:20.924]  The bond market continues to slump.
[00:20:21.104 --> 00:20:21.424]  J.P.
[00:20:21.444 --> 00:20:24.425]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[00:20:24.465 --> 00:20:26.246]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[00:20:26.746 --> 00:20:31.627]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[00:20:31.687 --> 00:20:34.128]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[00:20:34.248 --> 00:20:38.669]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[00:20:39.009 --> 00:20:39.409]  The U.S.
[00:20:39.449 --> 00:20:43.810]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.671]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[00:20:46.131 --> 00:20:48.914]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[00:20:49.175 --> 00:20:50.376]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:20:50.496 --> 00:20:56.082]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:20:56.162 --> 00:20:56.403]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:56.603]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.841 --> 00:21:05.283]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:21:05.523 --> 00:21:07.644]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:21:07.784 --> 00:21:10.245]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:21:10.505 --> 00:21:14.867]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:21:14.907 --> 00:21:15.588]  Here's why.
[00:21:15.988 --> 00:21:21.930]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:21:22.151 --> 00:21:28.173]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:21:28.394 --> 00:21:29.314]  But they're not cheating.
[00:21:29.554 --> 00:21:33.539]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:38.085]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:45.695]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:21:45.735 --> 00:21:46.276]  Get control.
[00:21:46.536 --> 00:21:47.097]  Get relief.
[00:21:47.177 --> 00:21:47.878]  Get some sleep.

[00:21:51.322 --> 00:21:54.706]  That's www.OutIn90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:21:54.726 --> 00:21:54.966]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:22:04.352 --> 00:22:04.712]  Thank you.
[00:22:23.152 --> 00:22:28.656]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:06.547]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:23:06.787 --> 00:23:11.668]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:11.888 --> 00:23:13.209]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:23:13.389 --> 00:23:16.770]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[00:24:10.609 --> 00:24:13.152]  Everybody knows that the dice are loaded.
[00:24:13.252 --> 00:24:17.976]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed.
[00:24:18.397 --> 00:24:23.102]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:24:23.362 --> 00:24:26.745]  Everybody knows the good guys lost.
[00:24:27.826 --> 00:24:37.910]  Here's a clip of Austin's Fox 7 News reporting on Rick Perry with a nice little jab at Ron Paul.
[00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:39.211]  Here it is.
[00:24:54.924 --> 00:25:00.205]  Rudy Giuliani officially files to get on the ballot here in Texas with the help of Governor Perry.
[00:25:00.846 --> 00:25:03.806]  And could Ron Paul drop out of the Republican race?
[00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:07.107]  Fox 7's Mike Rosen live at the state capitol.
[00:25:07.127 --> 00:25:07.527]  Mike.
[00:25:07.667 --> 00:25:09.988]  Mike, let's start with Giuliani and Perry.
[00:25:10.028 --> 00:25:15.029]  Of course, Perry filed Giuliani's paperwork for him today at state GOP party headquarters.
[00:25:15.829 --> 00:25:18.210]  Let me deliver
[00:25:19.366 --> 00:25:23.830]  To you, his application, and I think you'll find everything in order.
[00:25:24.270 --> 00:25:25.091]  Well, I sure hope so.
[00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:28.954]  Perry saying today he has no second thoughts about endorsing Giuliani so early.
[00:25:29.274 --> 00:25:34.018]  Perry is good friends with neighboring governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, who is surging in the polls.
[00:25:34.038 --> 00:25:35.559]  The two are philosophically alike.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:42.445]  Regarding his endorsement, Perry says it's the first time in 20-something years he's actually had to think deeply about who to support.
[00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:53.324]  There was a Texan on the ballot all those other years, and the decision was pretty much made at that particular time, whether it was Bush or whether it was Phil Graham.
[00:25:54.241 --> 00:25:56.583]  Well, there is a Texan on the ballot this time.
[00:25:56.623 --> 00:25:59.325]  His name is Ron Paul, campaigning in Iowa today.
[00:25:59.705 --> 00:26:04.910]  But he is a holdover from the Libertarian Party, and after a bit of a surge, is now slipping in the polls.
[00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:15.218]  This past weekend, the Libertarian National Committee voted to take Ron Paul back as a Libertarian candidate for president if he decides the GOP run just isn't working out for him.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:26.226]  We're sending a message to Ron Paul and his supporters that if the Republican Party doesn't want anything to do with Ron Paul, we sure would be happy to have him run for office again as a Libertarian.
[00:26:26.866 --> 00:26:31.308]  Paul, you might remember, ran for President unsuccessfully as a Libertarian candidate back in 1988.
[00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:40.093]  His campaign told the Libertarian National Committee, thanks but no thanks, Ron Paul will continue his campaign as a Republican candidate.
[00:26:40.393 --> 00:26:45.136]  Benedict, who you just heard from, says there are a couple of reasons that Libertarians will not
[00:26:45.196 --> 00:26:46.036]  And that's because they're scum.
[00:26:46.076 --> 00:26:48.938]  That's because they're little, greedy, liberal scum in the Libertarian Party.
[00:26:48.958 --> 00:26:50.059]  Most of them are Greens now.
[00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:11.386]  Oh yeah, the tens of millions of Libertarians.
[00:27:11.426 --> 00:27:14.066]  That wouldn't make any difference if he voted for Ron Paul.
[00:27:14.526 --> 00:27:16.047]  Now, you just heard a big trick there.
[00:27:17.467 --> 00:27:18.087]  It's a trick.
[00:27:19.207 --> 00:27:20.548]  And they've done this throughout history.
[00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:35.091]  They'll claim that there's some court hearing to decide whether somebody's property can be taken, and then the court will switch the date to five hours earlier or a day before, and then you show up on the wrong day and they say, you didn't know?
[00:27:35.111 --> 00:27:36.131]  We already took your property.
[00:27:37.538 --> 00:27:38.719]  Or it's already been decided.
[00:27:38.779 --> 00:27:42.040]  Or they're going to bulldoze the Community Recreation Center.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.802]  Or whatever is unpopular with the people, they'll just hide it.
[00:27:46.803 --> 00:27:47.743]  You know, what are you talking about?
[00:27:48.724 --> 00:27:49.404]  That's what they just did.
[00:27:49.424 --> 00:27:50.305]  It's the same type of trick.
[00:27:50.325 --> 00:27:51.945]  They just said, oh, Ron Paul's slipping.
[00:27:52.366 --> 00:27:54.907]  Ron Paul had a surge, but it's over for him now.
[00:27:55.587 --> 00:27:56.548]  And then they just announced.
[00:27:56.588 --> 00:28:02.211]  It's kind of like when Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated.
[00:28:02.251 --> 00:28:03.131]  See, that's a tactic.
[00:28:03.832 --> 00:28:04.672]  They do that in business.
[00:28:04.692 --> 00:28:06.313]  You know, like say you own a restaurant and they say, oh,
[00:28:07.757 --> 00:28:13.403]  Uh, you know, let's say the restaurant's closed for a day for maintenance and you tell your customers, oh no, that's shut down now by the health department.
[00:28:14.564 --> 00:28:17.147]  Or, oh no, that car dealership isn't open anymore.
[00:28:18.168 --> 00:28:20.150]  Or, oh no, they're not doing too good over there.
[00:28:21.191 --> 00:28:21.452]  Yeah.
[00:28:22.493 --> 00:28:26.316]  Oh, Ron Paul, after a surge in the polls, he's not doing too well.
[00:28:26.837 --> 00:28:37.505]  Actually, every major poll I've seen, unless it's these stage polls where they don't ask about Ron Paul, they ask about other candidates, never say his name, and then say, oh, Ron Paul didn't even show up in the poll!
[00:28:39.906 --> 00:28:41.327]  Because he wasn't in the poll.
[00:28:42.188 --> 00:28:43.969]  See, it's dirty tricks.
[00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:49.934]  Yeah, he's just raised more money than anybody in the quarter, he's gone from 4 points to 8 points to 15 points in New Hampshire.
[00:28:51.292 --> 00:28:54.076]  And then they just play that game and just say, oh no.
[00:28:54.096 --> 00:28:59.082]  Oh no, Ron Paul, he's in deep trouble.
[00:28:59.163 --> 00:28:59.944]  He's slipping.
[00:29:00.364 --> 00:29:01.826]  He doesn't have any support.
[00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:07.954]  Oh no, there's a $11.5 million raise this quarter so far with another
[00:29:10.658 --> 00:29:12.819]  Sixteen, seventeen days left in the month.
[00:29:13.319 --> 00:29:18.642]  And there's a money bomb coming up Saturday that the bookmakers are saying will raise at least six million, three to one odds.
[00:29:19.022 --> 00:29:24.385]  And there's a giant blimp launching for three hundred grand, raised by supporters up and down the East Coast.
[00:29:26.526 --> 00:29:28.967]  But see, they're using Huckabee, who does have a glass jaw.
[00:29:28.987 --> 00:29:30.708]  They've got Republican-Democratic memos out.
[00:29:31.868 --> 00:29:33.369]  They're literally pushing him now.
[00:29:33.389 --> 00:29:39.712]  The media's saying he's the winner to take conservatives and conservative Christians away from Ron Paul.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.962]  It's all about positioning Hillary.
[00:29:42.162 --> 00:29:45.386]  But I'll finish up with the Giuliani info.
[00:29:46.788 --> 00:29:48.070]  How it ties into Rick Perry.
[00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:50.933]  Big news on the other side of this parade.
[00:29:52.055 --> 00:29:53.116]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.457 --> 00:29:55.099]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.663]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.047 --> 00:30:05.269]  Hey, Dad, we need your help finishing the Christmas tree.
[00:30:05.449 --> 00:30:06.090]  Okay, boys.
[00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.453]  I've just got a few more Uncivil Liberties DVDs to ship out today.
[00:30:09.673 --> 00:30:11.394]  Why do you guys make Uncivil Liberties?
[00:30:11.474 --> 00:30:14.617]  You know how we like to look at those cool illustrations on Rents.com?
[00:30:14.637 --> 00:30:16.058]  Yeah, David Dees rocks.
[00:30:16.278 --> 00:30:17.439]  I like the chips one.
[00:30:17.579 --> 00:30:19.121]  Well, those aren't chocolate chips.
[00:30:19.421 --> 00:30:24.105]  Those are little tracking devices the government wants to put under our skin someday to track us.
[00:30:24.245 --> 00:30:26.427]  You mean the government's not the good guys?
[00:30:26.607 --> 00:30:27.908]  Well, they should be the good guys.
[00:30:27.988 --> 00:30:30.589]  They're supposed to do what we the people say they should do.
[00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:35.271]  But these days, the people are too busy watching their favorite TV shows to keep an eye on the government.
[00:30:35.371 --> 00:30:36.792]  You mean like SpongeBob?
[00:30:37.072 --> 00:30:37.872]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:30:38.253 --> 00:30:43.695]  So we made on civil liberties to help remind everyone to keep an eye on what's happening, not to fall asleep.
[00:30:43.895 --> 00:30:44.416]  Asleep?
[00:30:44.816 --> 00:30:46.296]  It's not even bedtime yet.
[00:30:46.877 --> 00:30:47.457]  Exactly.
[00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:52.042]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[00:31:02.209 --> 00:31:04.050]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:09.373]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:31:09.553 --> 00:31:10.894]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:31:11.154 --> 00:31:19.318]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:31:19.558 --> 00:31:25.281]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:31:25.461 --> 00:31:27.222]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:31:27.282 --> 00:31:29.464]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:31:29.484 --> 00:31:33.866]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:31:34.007 --> 00:31:36.128]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:43.973]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:31:44.053 --> 00:31:44.914]  We're good to go.
[00:32:02.202 --> 00:32:02.602]  Attention!
[00:32:02.722 --> 00:32:05.543]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:32:05.823 --> 00:32:10.125]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:10.445 --> 00:32:11.145]  Listen closely.
[00:32:11.786 --> 00:32:19.268]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:28.312]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[00:32:28.712 --> 00:32:28.792]  Yep.
[00:32:28.912 --> 00:32:34.134]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[00:32:34.414 --> 00:32:43.878]  However, it is still legal to own this compound and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[00:32:44.078 --> 00:32:46.459]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners.
[00:32:46.639 --> 00:32:49.702]  Simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[00:32:49.902 --> 00:32:53.465]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:57.208]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:57.248 --> 00:32:58.329]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:32:58.349 --> 00:33:05.975]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:33:14.648 --> 00:33:17.851]  I have to space out my research time very, very carefully.
[00:33:19.693 --> 00:33:21.494]  But I spend about 20 minutes a day.
[00:33:22.295 --> 00:33:24.256]  I've spent as much as two hours the day before.
[00:33:24.296 --> 00:33:27.299]  It's very addicting.
[00:33:27.439 --> 00:33:29.161]  Scanning and looking for patterns.
[00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.884]  Just using search engines with keywords.
[00:33:35.406 --> 00:33:41.011]  And you can see the talking points on Ron Paul.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.024]  Every two weeks or so, they change their attack pattern because nothing's been working as well as they'd like.
[00:33:48.204 --> 00:33:49.144]  It's had some effect.
[00:33:53.227 --> 00:33:58.230]  But basically, what you just heard in that Fox News piece was the equivalent of them saying, Ron Paul's dead.
[00:33:59.551 --> 00:34:00.992]  Yeah, Ron Paul, he died.
[00:34:01.052 --> 00:34:02.292]  Yeah, he's not in the race anymore.
[00:34:02.853 --> 00:34:03.913]  But it's more watered down.
[00:34:03.993 --> 00:34:09.136]  Oh, he had some success in the polls, but now he's sinking.
[00:34:10.936 --> 00:34:12.316]  You know, he may drop out.
[00:34:12.596 --> 00:34:14.477]  The Libertarians offered for him to come over.
[00:34:14.557 --> 00:34:18.537]  They're not supporting him either as a Republican.
[00:34:18.918 --> 00:34:25.139]  And yeah, Rick Perry says there's no Republican running from Texas, so he's supporting Giuliani.
[00:34:26.479 --> 00:34:31.100]  The whole thing was an attack on Ron Paul and a promotion of Giuliani.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.640]  And I didn't just see it there this morning.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:37.061]  I walked in this morning and this Fox clip was pointed out to me by Craig.
[00:34:39.352 --> 00:34:45.055]  No, I saw this the last week in the news going, yeah, Ron Paul's surge is over.
[00:34:45.736 --> 00:34:47.497]  Yeah, Ron Paul's not doing well.
[00:34:48.157 --> 00:34:51.079]  Yeah, look at these three polls where Ron Paul got zero.
[00:34:51.979 --> 00:34:56.422]  And they just list the poll name, but don't tell you that if you go to those polls either.
[00:34:57.703 --> 00:34:58.683]  We played these on air.
[00:35:00.384 --> 00:35:01.725]  People actually getting the poll calls.
[00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:05.820]  And we've gotten the copies of the polls.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:06.740]  This has been in the news.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.542]  That either they say, well, are you for Huckabee?
[00:35:09.922 --> 00:35:10.862]  Are you for Romney?
[00:35:11.342 --> 00:35:12.503]  Or are you for Giuliani?
[00:35:12.623 --> 00:35:13.483]  Are you for McCain?
[00:35:14.084 --> 00:35:14.804]  Or other.
[00:35:16.765 --> 00:35:18.526]  And then Ron Paul only gets 5%.
[00:35:20.266 --> 00:35:25.769]  But in some, where they say he doesn't even show up, they just list four or five candidates, and then there's no other.
[00:35:29.871 --> 00:35:32.192]  Or there'll be a none of the above, and they'll just say none of the above.
[00:35:32.865 --> 00:35:35.647]  See, and then you hear, oh, Ron Paul, he's not doing well.
[00:35:36.808 --> 00:35:47.755]  He has won every TV poll, which are per telephone or per IP address, except one Fox News one where he was winning by more than 12 points until they closed the poll, and then an hour later said, oh, guess what?
[00:35:48.155 --> 00:35:48.896]  Mitt Romney won.
[00:35:50.897 --> 00:35:51.718]  And it's disgusting.
[00:35:51.758 --> 00:35:54.279]  Mitt Romney's been an open border anti-gun pusher.
[00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:59.103]  Oh, you mean, he'll say he's pro-gun, but then be pro-NRA, let's pass new gun laws.
[00:36:00.484 --> 00:36:02.625]  See, they say they support it, but then stab you in the back.
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.741]  But forget Romney, who is much better than Giuliani.
[00:36:07.801 --> 00:36:10.822]  Giuliani is the son of a mob boss who did time for armed robbery.
[00:36:11.402 --> 00:36:13.043]  That's been in a few major newspapers.
[00:36:13.103 --> 00:36:14.483]  I know that sounds incredible.
[00:36:14.543 --> 00:36:14.944]  It's true.
[00:36:16.584 --> 00:36:22.726]  He is connected to all these mobsters and all these payoffs and corruption and a bunch of his own people being indicted and going to jail.
[00:36:22.946 --> 00:36:25.147]  That's why the globalists love him.
[00:36:25.187 --> 00:36:27.288]  They can pull the plug on him any time they want.
[00:36:27.648 --> 00:36:31.529]  He's got a mausoleum, a catacomb full of skeletons.
[00:36:34.036 --> 00:36:36.037]  Maybe even more than the Clintons per capita.
[00:36:36.057 --> 00:36:37.798]  I mean, this guy is just unbelievable.
[00:36:39.319 --> 00:36:40.720]  Then you expand out from there.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.980]  He's pro-abortion.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:49.784]  He tried to legalize all illegal aliens, as the mayor of New York, Bloomberg, is doing right now.
[00:36:50.825 --> 00:36:56.768]  He is, again, pro-abortion, pro-open borders, totally anti-gun, total police state supporter.
[00:36:58.872 --> 00:37:07.780]  But he gets endorsed by Pat Robertson, who actually said in a statement, well, that the pro-life issue isn't as important as his anti-terror, you know, the Islamofascists.
[00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.062]  Yeah, the Islamofascists killed 50 million people?
[00:37:10.923 --> 00:37:11.083]  No.
[00:37:13.105 --> 00:37:14.706]  But Roe v. Wade did.
[00:37:15.767 --> 00:37:25.576]  So, you have Giuliani, who literally is a ringer, and he's just like Kerry against Bush, but now they're passing the baton, appointing a bunch of Clinton people to the
[00:37:26.662 --> 00:37:29.783]  Justice Department, to the State Department, and to the White House.
[00:37:31.083 --> 00:37:33.664]  The White House is advising Hillary, writing her speeches.
[00:37:34.304 --> 00:37:39.126]  By the way, the source on that is Reuters, the Dallas Observer, and a half-dozen other.
[00:37:40.326 --> 00:37:47.328]  I was on a syndicated show in North Carolina, and a White House person called in, gave a White House writer's name.
[00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.089]  I don't know if it was really him, but he sounded like it.
[00:37:49.469 --> 00:37:51.430]  And he just said, how dare you lie and say that!
[00:37:51.450 --> 00:37:51.990]  You liar!
[00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:52.430]  Prove it!
[00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:56.131]  I googled it on air, and hammered him straight down into Hades.
[00:37:58.806 --> 00:38:00.066]  See, it doesn't work like that.
[00:38:00.086 --> 00:38:03.607]  It doesn't work like that anymore, punk.
[00:38:04.607 --> 00:38:06.888]  You're not going to do your deeds in the dark anymore.
[00:38:07.468 --> 00:38:08.929]  You're going to slit this country's throat.
[00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:10.869]  You're going to do it right out in front of everybody.
[00:38:11.949 --> 00:38:12.870]  You bunch of scum.
[00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:15.030]  Bunch of New World Order trash.
[00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.031]  And they use ideologies.
[00:38:17.051 --> 00:38:20.371]  They'll use anti-communists to set up a police state when they run the whole communist system.
[00:38:21.592 --> 00:38:26.533]  They'll use anti-Islamo-fascists when they again create and control the Islamo-fascists.
[00:38:27.412 --> 00:38:30.861]  They'll use the Zionist movement to be their foot soldiers today.
[00:38:31.222 --> 00:38:32.345]  Or the Christian Zionists.
[00:38:32.405 --> 00:38:33.247]  It's disgusting!
[00:38:33.508 --> 00:38:35.714]  You people are disgusting in the government!
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:41.141]  It's just an ideology, a shake-and-bake ideology, the establishment technocrats give you.
[00:38:41.301 --> 00:38:43.142]  They could care less about the ideology.
[00:38:43.382 --> 00:38:45.162]  They just use it as a mode of control over you.
[00:38:45.382 --> 00:38:51.604]  And you go out and do murders and terrorist acts and crimes, and you do it all in the name of your filthy ideology.
[00:38:52.064 --> 00:38:56.485]  You know, I've got an ideology that's very important and constitutional and based in reality and liberty.
[00:38:56.845 --> 00:38:58.526]  But I don't do anything immoral.
[00:38:58.546 --> 00:39:03.087]  A lot of revolutionary groups, you know, I'll steal, I'll do this, I'll do that.
[00:39:03.695 --> 00:39:07.216]  You know, I'll do anything, because what we're doing injustifies the means.
[00:39:07.776 --> 00:39:08.796]  I don't play that game.
[00:39:08.816 --> 00:39:11.477]  Alright, I'm already digressing here.
[00:39:17.098 --> 00:39:28.480]  The point I'm trying to get to here is that if there was ever a doubt of how bankrupt and wicked the Republican Party is, they stand on no issues.
[00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.436]  They stand on no issues.
[00:39:32.496 --> 00:39:36.317]  And, you know, people attack Giuliani because he's known to have a penchant to like to dress up like women.
[00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.378]  Perry's his good friend, of course, then.
[00:39:38.398 --> 00:39:40.899]  Uh, you know, that doesn't matter.
[00:39:41.119 --> 00:39:41.760]  Side issue.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:44.541]  You know, Bush likes gay prostitutes in the White House.
[00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:46.152]  Pretty bad, folks.
[00:39:46.232 --> 00:39:46.893]  But you know what?
[00:39:47.333 --> 00:39:58.963]  That's nothing compared to running white slavery rings, or bombarding countries for 17 years, or starting wars, or putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, or vetoing laws that would ban mercury in vaccines.
[00:39:59.243 --> 00:40:01.525]  You know, that's the stuff that matters in the final equation.
[00:40:03.006 --> 00:40:03.807]  But just look at them.
[00:40:03.847 --> 00:40:12.755]  A pack of pro-open border, pro-abortion, anti-gun, trash to a man, absolute filth to a man,
[00:40:14.492 --> 00:40:17.173]  And look at who National Review endorses.
[00:40:17.213 --> 00:40:18.454]  Look at the people they endorse.
[00:40:18.474 --> 00:40:19.414]  Look at who they push.
[00:40:19.794 --> 00:40:21.635]  Look at who they try to cram down our throats.
[00:40:23.336 --> 00:40:27.797]  When we have not just somebody who's a good conservative or a libertarian, but a statesman.
[00:40:30.879 --> 00:40:32.559]  An honorable person.
[00:40:32.919 --> 00:40:35.761]  Someone who has a record of doing what they say they're going to do.
[00:40:36.561 --> 00:40:41.083]  Someone who is the polar opposite of what we have in Washington today.
[00:40:41.503 --> 00:40:42.123]  And what do we see?
[00:40:42.183 --> 00:40:44.004]  Pat Robertson, that piece of trash.
[00:40:45.214 --> 00:40:46.655]  And I don't want to hear it from you anymore.
[00:40:47.476 --> 00:40:58.584]  I mean, we had people get really mad at us, and we even lost a few affiliates, when Pat Robertson went on air in 2000 and said, China's doing what it has to do with forced abortion in China.
[00:40:59.024 --> 00:41:02.666]  And then his clarification on CNN was, yeah, I mean, they got too many people.
[00:41:03.467 --> 00:41:06.869]  And people called up saying, I'm of the devil, maybe Pat's right.
[00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:07.470]  You know what?
[00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:08.371]  You're not Christians.
[00:41:08.531 --> 00:41:10.092]  You're scum.
[00:41:11.833 --> 00:41:12.153]  You are.
[00:41:12.213 --> 00:41:13.074]  You are filth.
[00:41:14.858 --> 00:41:16.699]  Go join Pastor Hagee.
[00:41:16.739 --> 00:41:18.300]  Say Jesus isn't the Messiah.
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.760]  This isn't a religious show.
[00:41:20.321 --> 00:41:24.742]  My point is, these people are the polar opposites of what they say they are.
[00:41:25.063 --> 00:41:33.006]  They say they're Christian conservatives, but they're for gay marriage, abortion, open borders, Jesus isn't the Messiah.
[00:41:33.266 --> 00:41:34.407]  I've had it with you!
[00:41:34.687 --> 00:41:35.767]  I've had it with you!
[00:41:37.108 --> 00:41:39.069]  You are disgusting trash!
[00:41:40.245 --> 00:41:46.327]  So go to your little social clubs, go play racquetball at your big mega church, and prance around and cheat on each other.
[00:41:46.727 --> 00:41:50.188]  You know, most of these churches are swingers clubs, folks.
[00:41:50.688 --> 00:41:51.928]  And I don't say that for effect.
[00:41:51.968 --> 00:41:52.809]  I mean, that's what they are.
[00:41:53.129 --> 00:41:54.229]  They're business clubs.
[00:41:54.469 --> 00:41:55.629]  They're swinger clubs.
[00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:57.610]  That's all it is.
[00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:04.472]  It's a daycare center for the kids while the guys go out on the golf course and the women go out and have sex with the greenskeepers.
[00:42:05.612 --> 00:42:08.933]  That's what trash America yuppiedom is all about.
[00:42:09.597 --> 00:42:10.537]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:42:10.577 --> 00:42:12.298]  You stood for nothing, so you're going to fall.
[00:42:12.578 --> 00:42:15.859]  Your dollar's already been devalued by 60%, you dumb twits.
[00:42:16.759 --> 00:42:17.660]  You love tyranny.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.620]  You love open borders.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:20.101]  You love being a fake conservative.
[00:42:20.441 --> 00:42:24.422]  You are the enemies of America and enemies of this republic.
[00:42:24.662 --> 00:42:25.642]  You are scum.
[00:42:25.902 --> 00:42:27.283]  You are cancer to this nation.
[00:42:29.818 --> 00:42:33.499]  I just can't handle Giuliani who looks just like Nosferatu.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.701]  I mean, he literally, with no makeup, could star in the next Nosferatu movie.
[00:42:38.861 --> 00:42:40.522]  You ever seen the old German Nosferatu?
[00:42:40.742 --> 00:42:43.043]  I mean, it must be Giuliani's grandpa.
[00:42:45.484 --> 00:42:49.625]  I mean, the guy, I don't usually go off of cover, but I mean, you know, his actions fit.
[00:42:49.866 --> 00:42:56.188]  The guy looks like Day of the Dead, his dad's an armed robbery mob boss, you couldn't make it up!
[00:42:58.115 --> 00:43:02.937]  And we've got this appointed governor, Rick Perry, who won by less than 40% of the vote.
[00:43:02.977 --> 00:43:03.257]  What, 37?
[00:43:03.518 --> 00:43:03.257]  38?
[00:43:04.418 --> 00:43:06.259]  In a stage 3, 4-way race.
[00:43:06.719 --> 00:43:08.700]  The people running, the Strayhorn knew what she was doing.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:10.281]  Kingy Friedman meant well.
[00:43:11.041 --> 00:43:11.921]  I'm glad he's running again.
[00:43:11.961 --> 00:43:13.582]  The point is, all this is going on.
[00:43:13.602 --> 00:43:16.363]  You have this whole thing swirling around.
[00:43:18.544 --> 00:43:19.745]  And what do we get in the middle of it?
[00:43:20.065 --> 00:43:26.148]  We get the Republicans thinking nothing of their conservative base and saying, you know what?
[00:43:26.744 --> 00:43:30.792]  We'll stick the pacifier of the war on your mouth and you can suck on it and go nom nom nom.
[00:43:31.293 --> 00:43:38.046]  That's right, don't let the Islamo-fascists get you while we leave the border wide open and give everybody driver's licenses and welfare cards.
[00:43:38.066 --> 00:43:38.748]  I mean, literally!
[00:43:39.924 --> 00:43:41.205]  Nothing to do with security.
[00:43:41.485 --> 00:44:01.919]  We've got blips going up over all the major cities, and we're scanning your face everywhere, and scanning your driver's license and your license plates, and we're gonna try to force you to take inoculations, and the NSA is listening to you, and torture is good, and Blackwater's gonna operate domestically, and we're gonna pass a bunch of new gun laws, and isn't it conservative?
[00:44:01.959 --> 00:44:03.561]  And you go, yes, it is.
[00:44:07.383 --> 00:44:08.304]  So here's the big news.
[00:44:10.868 --> 00:44:11.888]  As if that isn't enough.
[00:44:12.929 --> 00:44:17.190]  Perry, in the Dallas Morning News, puts out a press release and goes to the imaginary Bilderberg grid.
[00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.451]  Oh, I still get emails every week saying it doesn't exist.
[00:44:21.051 --> 00:44:24.472]  Just like SPP doesn't exist, NAU doesn't exist, none of it exists.
[00:44:24.992 --> 00:44:26.393]  Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[00:44:26.773 --> 00:44:27.353]  They're building it.
[00:44:27.633 --> 00:44:30.634]  Press releases, announcements, big signs up everywhere.
[00:44:30.654 --> 00:44:31.815]  It doesn't exist, just to have you know.
[00:44:32.155 --> 00:44:34.255]  So I'm going to talk about imaginary things now.
[00:44:34.836 --> 00:44:37.917]  Perry goes to the... That's how dumb they think you are!
[00:44:38.097 --> 00:44:39.077]  That's how they treat you!
[00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:46.512]  Governor Rick Perry is taken as one of 15 member guests each year at Bilderberg.
[00:44:46.972 --> 00:44:50.053]  He meets with the Queen of the Netherlands and the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[00:44:50.293 --> 00:44:51.653]  He goes to Istanbul, Turkey.
[00:44:51.893 --> 00:45:06.618]  He has the chutzpah, the gall, the bravado, the machismo to go to the meeting and openly announce it and then guess who a bunch of the Bilderberg group members are?
[00:45:06.878 --> 00:45:07.918]  Oh, they're the heads of Centra.
[00:45:07.938 --> 00:45:09.459]  They're the heads of the banks financing it.
[00:45:10.091 --> 00:45:14.414]  They're the ones handing over the highways.
[00:45:14.434 --> 00:45:14.754]  8,000 miles.
[00:45:14.774 --> 00:45:16.796]  There's only 7,000 miles of toll roads in the country.
[00:45:17.156 --> 00:45:18.677]  Texas is 8,000 miles.
[00:45:18.877 --> 00:45:21.999]  That's their, TxDOT's official announcement, to Centra for no money!
[00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:26.922]  The state builds it, finances it, maintains it, and then they just give part of the money to the state.
[00:45:29.044 --> 00:45:30.485]  Literal handover.
[00:45:30.545 --> 00:45:31.605]  Literal like a queen.
[00:45:31.625 --> 00:45:35.108]  You know, Queen Isabella saying, I give you the Americas.
[00:45:35.208 --> 00:45:36.729]  It's just, I cede to thee.
[00:45:36.789 --> 00:45:38.170]  They just, aha, it's yours.
[00:45:40.070 --> 00:45:43.953]  99% in some polls, 97% in other polls in Texas are against it.
[00:45:44.773 --> 00:45:46.635]  The legislature passes a law against it.
[00:45:46.675 --> 00:45:47.715]  Perry says, vetoed.
[00:45:47.815 --> 00:45:48.576]  I do what I want.
[00:45:49.096 --> 00:45:50.777]  He goes and meets with these criminals.
[00:45:51.338 --> 00:45:55.621]  He violates the Logan Act to go sell out a state in a secret business meeting.
[00:45:55.901 --> 00:45:56.801]  Not allowed to do that.
[00:45:57.622 --> 00:46:00.304]  And then guess who Giuliani is the head lawyer for?
[00:46:01.044 --> 00:46:03.606]  He owns Brisewell and Giuliani.
[00:46:04.972 --> 00:46:12.477]  He merged with them four years ago, three and a half years ago, and he is the actual acting lawyer that does the deals.
[00:46:12.557 --> 00:46:17.700]  It's even his portfolio is Cintra of Spain.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.562]  By the way, they're all over the country, but Texas is their big grab.
[00:46:20.902 --> 00:46:21.802]  More than the whole nation.
[00:46:24.464 --> 00:46:33.810]  The North American Union funding mechanism is the Napa Superhighway, and the first major leg of its hub is from Kansas City through Oklahoma down into Texas.
[00:46:36.269 --> 00:46:40.192]  So if you're in Missouri or Kansas or Oklahoma or Texas, you are absolute front lines.
[00:46:40.333 --> 00:46:43.595]  On up into Indiana, Illinois, Minnesota, it's the whole deal.
[00:46:43.956 --> 00:46:46.037]  And that's just one of 83 of these they're grabbing.
[00:46:46.218 --> 00:46:50.281]  They're grabbing the roads, saying it doesn't exist while they do it.
[00:46:50.301 --> 00:46:53.664]  Giuliani's running the whole thing.
[00:46:55.125 --> 00:47:00.190]  And now I've got three different news articles saying Perry is being considered as his running mate.
[00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:03.793]  I told you four months ago, five months ago,
[00:47:04.767 --> 00:47:09.128]  However long ago he went, I said, you watch, he's going to end up being a VP, or he's going to end up running for President.
[00:47:09.408 --> 00:47:11.229]  People say, oh, we've already had too many Texans.
[00:47:11.689 --> 00:47:13.269]  But see, that'll balance the ticket out.
[00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:17.551]  Having a New Yorker, but don't worry, Northerners always do that.
[00:47:17.691 --> 00:47:23.412]  Southern, when a Southerner runs, they almost always go for a Vice President who's a Northerner.
[00:47:23.472 --> 00:47:26.473]  Clinton didn't do that, he went with the TMC and broke that tradition.
[00:47:27.633 --> 00:47:28.834]  Albert Gore, Jr.
[00:47:31.363 --> 00:47:37.587]  So you put it together, it's a perfect move, and I predict now... I mean, it's a 95% chance.
[00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:40.169]  I hope I'm wrong, but I'm not gonna be.
[00:47:41.070 --> 00:47:42.911]  If we make a big enough fuss about this, maybe.
[00:47:45.252 --> 00:47:56.120]  I predict now that Governor Rick Perry is gonna be the vice presidential running mate, bringing Texas, the West, and the South in for that little monster, Giuliani.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.983]  Giuliani, that effeminate twit,
[00:48:02.475 --> 00:48:05.677]  That transvestite with Rick Perry.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:21.208]  I mean, that's who we end up with, ladies and gentlemen, running against Hillary, and then those two can take the fall, but that further positions Perry for four years from now, eight years from now.
[00:48:22.907 --> 00:48:25.288]  And by the way, they vacation together, they're constantly together.
[00:48:25.348 --> 00:48:31.251]  It's probably going to be Perry Schwarzenegger, Perry President, Schwarzenegger Vice President, if they're able to amend that.
[00:48:31.311 --> 00:48:36.914]  And after the big nuke attack, or whatever they're going to launch, believe me, they're going to have constitutional conventions, and they're going to trash everything.
[00:48:38.335 --> 00:48:40.216]  I mean, you think you've been raped now.
[00:48:40.316 --> 00:48:43.017]  You think your credit cards are maxed out now.
[00:48:43.037 --> 00:48:46.359]  You know, my uncle lives out in the country, and the swan truck comes by.
[00:48:46.379 --> 00:48:50.281]  You know, he goes to the grocery store every few weeks, but the swan truck comes by once a week.
[00:48:51.030 --> 00:48:54.871]  And the swan truck guy told him it's the worst he's ever seen business in years and years driving.
[00:48:55.231 --> 00:48:56.771]  Everybody's credit cards are maxed out.
[00:48:56.791 --> 00:49:00.492]  They're saving their money to buy fuel to drive to work in East Texas.
[00:49:04.193 --> 00:49:06.793]  Who knows if they'll even have routes out to the country anymore.
[00:49:07.093 --> 00:49:07.834]  I mean, it's all right.
[00:49:07.854 --> 00:49:10.134]  That's just another little indicator on the ground.
[00:49:11.754 --> 00:49:18.396]  Meanwhile, we have a mob boss who will be running with, and this is in
[00:49:19.565 --> 00:49:24.249]  Dallas News, Austin News, Atlantic, TheAtlantic.com.
[00:49:25.510 --> 00:49:26.311]  Got a bunch of these.
[00:49:28.733 --> 00:49:29.974]  All right here in front of me.
[00:49:31.556 --> 00:49:32.797]  This is what we're treated to.
[00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:34.578]  This is what is put in our face.
[00:49:35.179 --> 00:49:37.561]  And we're told it's conservative.
[00:49:38.001 --> 00:49:43.246]  I mean, this guy was for complete, total amnesty of all illegal aliens.
[00:49:46.128 --> 00:49:46.609]  This guy
[00:49:47.469 --> 00:49:50.009]  I mean, if he was a Democrat, fine, be for gay marriage.
[00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:53.110]  The point is, he's the polar opposite of a Republican.
[00:49:54.330 --> 00:50:07.693]  And they're going to bring Huckabee out to try to steal votes from Paul as a counterbalance, because Paul was number two or number three or number one, and I even commissioned one of them with Zogby, number two or number three or number one, in all the polls of religious conservatives.
[00:50:08.213 --> 00:50:14.234]  And now Huckabee is stealing some of his, but Ron Paul's already gained so much trajectory, he's going almost straight up right now.
[00:50:14.972 --> 00:50:17.813]  He would break through, he would get the nomination, he would win.
[00:50:18.194 --> 00:50:19.854]  He's the only candidate that could beat Hillary.
[00:50:19.954 --> 00:50:32.761]  I saw more numbers and more data on that today, where they're admitting that the entire Republican field, and then they mention all the big guys, will totally fail because of their pro-war stance and other issues, and that people are sick of Republicans.
[00:50:32.981 --> 00:50:33.961]  They don't mention Ron Paul.
[00:50:34.962 --> 00:50:37.343]  In every statistical analysis, Ron Paul.
[00:50:37.663 --> 00:50:38.724]  So, Republicans, hey!
[00:50:40.424 --> 00:50:43.306]  Go ahead and go for your mob boss, open borders,
[00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:50.264]  Uh, guy, Andrew Bilderberg, guy, who couldn't even get 39% of the vote in Texas, but still is our governor.
[00:50:50.945 --> 00:50:52.406]  And just thanks a lot, America.
[00:50:52.926 --> 00:50:57.829]  Uh, you're gonna be raped completely, you're gonna be totally financially destroyed, and you all asked for it.
[00:50:58.129 --> 00:50:58.489]  Thank you.
[00:50:58.869 --> 00:51:01.151]  We'll be right back with some global news.
[00:51:02.091 --> 00:51:03.472]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.492 --> 00:51:05.593]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:10.516]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:11.221 --> 00:51:13.382]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:14.023 --> 00:51:16.284]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.824 --> 00:51:19.266]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.006 --> 00:51:27.331]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.347 --> 00:51:35.351]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.811 --> 00:51:39.294]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.674 --> 00:51:42.176]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.236 --> 00:51:43.377]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.397 --> 00:51:44.137]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.177 --> 00:51:45.238]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.458 --> 00:51:46.199]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.439 --> 00:51:47.300]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:59.089 --> 00:52:00.254]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.132 --> 00:52:01.913]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.053 --> 00:52:02.793]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.893 --> 00:52:08.978]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:09.238 --> 00:52:10.819]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:11.079 --> 00:52:13.561]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:13.921 --> 00:52:28.511]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist with the U.S.
[00:52:28.551 --> 00:52:28.892]  government.

[00:52:31.193 --> 00:52:37.114]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:41.735]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:53:59.386 --> 00:54:10.822]  Hello, this is IMC polling, calling with a one question opinion poll regarding the 2008 Republican Presidential Primary.
[00:54:10.842 --> 00:54:11.142]  Okay.
[00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:13.650]  What do you want me to say?
[00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:15.731]  Your primary election was held today.
[00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:17.132]  Who would you vote for?
[00:54:17.152 --> 00:54:19.653]  Press 1 for John McCain.
[00:54:20.233 --> 00:54:22.494]  Press 2 for Rudy Giuliani.
[00:54:23.075 --> 00:54:25.376]  Press 3 for Fred Thompson.
[00:54:25.856 --> 00:54:28.177]  Press 4 for Mitt Romney.
[00:54:28.557 --> 00:54:30.898]  Press 5 for Mike Huckabee.
[00:54:31.359 --> 00:54:34.080]  Press 6 for other or none of the above.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:37.701]  Press 7 to no longer receive these types of calls.
[00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:40.070]  Thank you.
[00:54:40.090 --> 00:54:44.531]  The number we contacted you on will be removed from any future messaging lists.
[00:54:44.911 --> 00:54:46.572]  We apologize for any inconvenience.
[00:54:46.772 --> 00:54:47.752]  This call may have caused.
[00:54:48.292 --> 00:54:48.812]  Goodbye.
[00:54:50.273 --> 00:54:53.634]  That's just one of the many actual polls that go out to people.
[00:54:53.714 --> 00:54:59.455]  That's how these hucksters, these con artists, these scammers, that's all the government and the corporations that own it do.
[00:54:59.995 --> 00:55:01.956]  They're running frauds against us all.
[00:55:01.996 --> 00:55:03.536]  They do it on a million subjects.
[00:55:03.917 --> 00:55:05.537]  They laugh at us all the way to the bank.
[00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:10.252]  Shifting gears, you know, they have this stealth integration of Europe.
[00:55:10.913 --> 00:55:14.456]  There is a European Union, despite what some people want to say, it does exist.
[00:55:16.197 --> 00:55:24.543]  They say there's no North American Union being funded despite thousands of documents and statements and Fox and Canadian Prime Ministers saying it and government officials in the U.S.
[00:55:24.583 --> 00:55:24.964]  saying it.
[00:55:26.345 --> 00:55:28.386]  And official government white papers saying it.
[00:55:29.287 --> 00:55:30.388]  They just say it doesn't exist.
[00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:34.291]  Just like they said the EU didn't exist until it was too late.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:44.649]  Well, England, for the last eight years, they've always said they're going to have a public referendum, but then when the polls show 75, 85, 90 percent, depending on the referendum against it, they always pull it.
[00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:47.151]  Gordon Brown doesn't care.
[00:55:47.191 --> 00:55:52.716]  The face-scanning cameras, the riot police are in, you talk to people on the street, police come up and ask you why you're talking to people.
[00:55:53.156 --> 00:55:55.939]  I mean, it's total Nazi Germany, total Soviet Union.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:57.701]  I've been there, I've had it happen.
[00:55:57.721 --> 00:55:59.282]  It's all over the British news, they do this.
[00:56:02.757 --> 00:56:12.285]  First, Gordon Brown said a few weeks ago that he was not going to bring forward the treaty.
[00:56:12.365 --> 00:56:18.651]  Then he said he wasn't going to sign the European Union Constitution Expansion Treaty, bringing England more into it.
[00:56:19.972 --> 00:56:21.353]  First, they said it didn't exist.
[00:56:21.373 --> 00:56:28.239]  We have two articles up on PrisonPlanet.com today about this, and then now it turns out he's going to sign it, but not publicly.
[00:56:29.033 --> 00:56:29.833]  London Telegraph.
[00:56:29.874 --> 00:56:31.935]  Gordon Brown will sign EU Treaty in private.
[00:56:32.295 --> 00:56:37.197]  Gordon Brown has announced that he will travel to Portugal to sign the controversial European Union Reform Treaty.
[00:56:38.698 --> 00:56:48.904]  Doubt has been thrown on Mr. Brown's attendance at the signing ceremony in Lisbon on Thursday because of his commitment to give evidence to high-ranking House of Commons committee that morning.
[00:56:49.804 --> 00:56:52.966]  Reports of his possible absence sparked criticism that the Prime Minister was trying to
[00:56:53.709 --> 00:56:55.810]  Disassociate himself from the EU plan.
[00:56:56.370 --> 00:57:02.233]  On a policy level, it would also have meant he missed negotiations between heads of state taking place on the sidelines of the ceremony.
[00:57:02.573 --> 00:57:03.834]  There's no negotiation going on.
[00:57:03.854 --> 00:57:05.094]  This was figured out a long time ago.
[00:57:06.075 --> 00:57:14.999]  And it goes on, and here in my stack, I printed it, but I don't see it, was a story four days ago where the Brits were demonstrating and protesting and being told demonstrations aren't allowed now.
[00:57:15.019 --> 00:57:17.700]  It's freedom, just like Soviet Union, just like Russia today.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:18.840]  Or here.
[00:57:19.901 --> 00:57:21.421]  Saying, hey, we want a right to vote on this!
[00:57:21.461 --> 00:57:22.342]  We don't want this!
[00:57:23.263 --> 00:57:26.624]  And they just say, we're not doing the treaty, don't worry, and now he's going to go sign it.
[00:57:31.026 --> 00:57:36.407]  They'll probably write news articles from the establishment writers saying this doesn't exist, you know.
[00:57:38.908 --> 00:57:44.730]  I mean, Americans on average are the dumbest out there in the world now with test scores and not knowing what their country is on a map.
[00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:47.211]  But Brits are a close second.
[00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:48.551]  They're dumb as dirt on average.
[00:57:48.591 --> 00:57:49.312]  They don't know anything.
[00:57:51.408 --> 00:57:53.710]  They know enough, though, to say, hey, we don't want that.
[00:57:53.730 --> 00:57:55.952]  And the government just says, hey, you know what?
[00:57:56.132 --> 00:57:56.673]  Shut up!
[00:57:57.493 --> 00:57:57.954]  Shut up!
[00:57:57.994 --> 00:57:59.976]  We got people with automatic weapons!
[00:58:00.136 --> 00:58:01.637]  We're building prisons everywhere!
[00:58:02.057 --> 00:58:03.018]  Shut up!
[00:58:04.179 --> 00:58:05.440]  Take your vaccines!
[00:58:05.961 --> 00:58:06.581]  Shut up!
[00:58:07.762 --> 00:58:08.463]  We rule!
[00:58:08.723 --> 00:58:09.544]  We dominate!
[00:58:09.784 --> 00:58:10.645]  We're the bosses!
[00:58:10.865 --> 00:58:11.766]  It's called tyranny!
[00:58:12.386 --> 00:58:13.447]  We wear black masks!
[00:58:13.627 --> 00:58:15.109]  We drive black armored vehicles!
[00:58:15.509 --> 00:58:16.470]  Shut up!
[00:58:18.248 --> 00:58:22.771]  You're going into the EU whether you come kicking or screaming or not.
[00:58:23.312 --> 00:58:25.073]  Shut up, it doesn't exist, trash!
[00:58:28.315 --> 00:58:31.177]  Bilderberg doesn't exist, but I'm the governor of Texas and I'm going.
[00:58:31.778 --> 00:58:32.418]  Ha ha ha!
[00:58:32.959 --> 00:58:38.683]  And I like Giuliani, I like mob bosses' sons, I like open borders promoters, because I'm a piece of trash.
[00:58:38.923 --> 00:58:40.364]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:47.273 --> 00:58:49.634]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.117 --> 00:58:58.798]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.418 --> 00:59:00.538]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.199 --> 00:59:02.299]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.959 --> 00:59:03.780]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:05.500]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.101 --> 00:59:09.742]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.282 --> 00:59:14.364]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.548 --> 00:59:33.477]  Dr. Rand Paul, Ron Paul's son, is joining us in the next segment to talk about his father, to talk about the campaign, to talk about a lot of political issues, the big money bomb coming up Sunday.
[00:59:33.957 --> 00:59:35.578]  We've only got him for about five minutes right now.
[00:59:35.638 --> 00:59:46.845]  It's Trevor Lyman, the guy that took a little internet idea he saw by another great mind on YouTube for the 5th of November money bomb and pushed it out using his marketing skills as an internet entrepreneur with successful companies.
[00:59:47.757 --> 00:59:50.879]  And you picked up the ball as freedom lovers out there.
[00:59:51.319 --> 01:00:00.944]  We raised 4.2 plus mil, over a million since then, directly contributed and attributed to the work of our grassroots operations, headed up by Mr. Lyman.
[01:00:02.505 --> 01:00:07.528]  And now the Ron Paul blimp, who is Ron Paul, will be launching soon.
[01:00:07.908 --> 01:00:09.549]  That was a success thanks to you.
[01:00:10.496 --> 01:00:18.239]  And now the giant money bomb is coming Sunday with the media's new spin saying Ron Paul isn't popular anymore.
[01:00:18.359 --> 01:00:19.200]  Total spin.
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.680]  It's like saying somebody's dead.
[01:00:20.700 --> 01:00:22.421]  And then people believe it.
[01:00:23.142 --> 01:00:25.022]  One time somebody went on the web and said, I died.
[01:00:25.062 --> 01:00:26.783]  And people, hundreds of calls, they believed it.
[01:00:27.263 --> 01:00:29.204]  And they're basically saying, oh, he's down in the polls now.
[01:00:29.244 --> 01:00:29.944]  He doesn't exist.
[01:00:29.964 --> 01:00:30.625]  He's gone now.
[01:00:30.905 --> 01:00:31.625]  No more support.
[01:00:31.805 --> 01:00:36.387]  Whatever indicator shows, from web traffic to meetup groups to polls, shows he's surging.
[01:00:36.607 --> 01:00:37.988]  Trevor, give us a three-minute report.
[01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:39.890]  Hey, how's it going?
[01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:40.931]  Sure.
[01:00:41.011 --> 01:00:42.491]  I was just in the hangar just now.
[01:00:43.412 --> 01:00:44.192]  The blimp is there.
[01:00:44.252 --> 01:00:44.952]  It's huge.
[01:00:45.673 --> 01:00:47.133]  And it's awesome.
[01:00:47.613 --> 01:00:49.974]  And we're putting the banner on it right now as we speak.
[01:00:52.095 --> 01:00:54.836]  Basically, the delay right now are the banners.
[01:00:54.956 --> 01:01:02.379]  But to credit the company, they're making two banners, what would take over a month and under a week.
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.201]  So they're really pushing that out.
[01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:08.702]  And we're waiting for the next banner, which we're going to fly in tomorrow.
[01:01:09.344 --> 01:01:15.192]  And then put that on overnight and hopefully fall goes as well and we really don't want to take any more time than this.
[01:01:15.852 --> 01:01:26.125]  We're going to launch Friday morning and the crew has already said that they're going to fly straight and to try to get us to Boston and we will make it we can make it absolutely to Boston on the 16th.
[01:01:26.806 --> 01:01:28.008]  The only thing that could
[01:01:29.051 --> 01:01:30.392]  Uh, play a role is the weather.
[01:01:30.412 --> 01:01:37.379]  The blimps do have limits to what they can handle, and there is, uh, I've heard, uh, nor'easter brewing, but these things change.
[01:01:37.659 --> 01:01:42.743]  Uh, we could be all clear, but definitely, no matter what, we will be in the air during the 16th.
[01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:46.627]  So when that money comes in, wherever the blimp is, they'll want footage of it, and we'll, we'll have that.
[01:01:46.967 --> 01:01:47.908]  Hopefully, we'll be in Boston.
[01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:55.915]  Real fast, because we don't have much time, uh, what, right now, how much money is in, uh, how many cities is the blimp gonna visit?
[01:01:57.282 --> 01:02:05.684]  Well, we'll probably go really quickly up to Boston, so we'll fly it through D.C.
[01:02:05.744 --> 01:02:07.264]  and definitely through New York on the way.
[01:02:07.284 --> 01:02:12.086]  But then after we do the event this Sunday, we'll continue to fly it.
[01:02:12.586 --> 01:02:20.028]  So that's when we'll definitely do a lot more rides and drops.
[01:02:20.288 --> 01:02:26.049]  And you'll also be posting on the Ron Paul Blimp, it's itinerary for people who want to see it and get rides in it.
[01:02:26.849 --> 01:02:27.249]  That's right.
[01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:36.571]  We were just, everything's been, you know, we're trying to, from conception to in the air in about two to three weeks, and it's a decent project, a decent-sized project.
[01:02:36.831 --> 01:02:38.011]  Trevor, money bomb.
[01:02:38.251 --> 01:02:38.691]  Money bomb.
[01:02:38.711 --> 01:02:40.392]  You got 60 seconds coming up this Sunday.
[01:02:40.432 --> 01:02:40.952]  What can we do?
[01:02:42.112 --> 01:02:49.014]  Just spread the word and get ready, and you know, right now we've got about 30,000 pledges, very close to that.
[01:02:49.054 --> 01:02:49.914]  We had 18,000 for November 5th.
[01:02:51.815 --> 01:02:53.437]  So all things are looking great.
[01:02:53.617 --> 01:02:55.519]  We're talking six, seven mil right now.
[01:02:55.539 --> 01:02:57.061]  You have things trend like last time.
[01:02:57.681 --> 01:02:58.102]  That's right.
[01:02:58.342 --> 01:02:58.702]  That's right.
[01:02:58.722 --> 01:02:59.443]  And you know what, though?
[01:02:59.503 --> 01:03:02.406]  I think we have two additional factors we didn't have last time.
[01:03:02.506 --> 01:03:04.488]  One is a lot of media talking about it.
[01:03:04.508 --> 01:03:06.530]  They'll be reporting on it all day.
[01:03:07.191 --> 01:03:07.752]  Three factors.
[01:03:07.772 --> 01:03:11.015]  We'll have the blimp in the air that I think will add a lot of momentum to it.
[01:03:11.645 --> 01:03:16.526]  And people know now that it worked last time, and I think everyone's going to be inclined to give that money.
[01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:18.727]  Yeah, it'll be a victory if we get six mil.
[01:03:18.767 --> 01:03:19.867]  We're shooting for ten.
[01:03:20.287 --> 01:03:21.347]  I think it's going to happen.
[01:03:21.787 --> 01:03:24.888]  There's a new spin out there that Ron Paul doesn't exist anymore.
[01:03:24.908 --> 01:03:25.488]  Have you heard this?
[01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:27.328]  I haven't, but you know what?
[01:03:27.368 --> 01:03:29.729]  That's just more fuel to show them that he does.
[01:03:30.309 --> 01:03:30.789]  That's right.
[01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:32.770]  We've got to double the money bomb.
[01:03:32.830 --> 01:03:33.730]  Ten mil, folks.
[01:03:34.270 --> 01:03:34.790]  Show them.
[01:03:35.210 --> 01:03:36.470]  Coming up this Sunday.
[01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:37.151]  Do it.
[01:03:37.751 --> 01:03:38.631]  Fire out the website.
[01:03:39.793 --> 01:03:41.494]  Uh, let's see, TeaParty07.com.
[01:03:41.514 --> 01:03:43.094]  This is a donation site.
[01:03:43.914 --> 01:03:45.014]  And RonPaulBlint.com.
[01:03:45.034 --> 01:03:46.135]  It's for the Blints.
[01:03:46.455 --> 01:03:49.756]  Trevor, I'm going to get you back up tomorrow and Friday and Sunday with reports.
[01:03:49.796 --> 01:03:50.376]  God bless you.
[01:03:51.076 --> 01:03:51.636]  Great, thank you.
[01:03:54.197 --> 01:03:55.577]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.597 --> 01:03:57.718]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.438 --> 01:04:03.200]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by our government.
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.080]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:08.321]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:11.392]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.113 --> 01:04:19.464]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.463 --> 01:04:27.446]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.907 --> 01:04:31.389]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.769 --> 01:04:34.291]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:34.331 --> 01:04:35.492]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.512 --> 01:04:36.232]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.353]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.573 --> 01:04:38.314]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.554 --> 01:04:39.675]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:05:46.967 --> 01:05:51.901]  HerbalHealer.com Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:05:52.873 --> 01:06:00.358]  Hi, I'm Lynette Brooks, founder of MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse combining the healing power of flaxseed with the detoxification of bentonite clay.
[01:06:00.658 --> 01:06:06.682]  In a perfect world, we would eat natural healthy foods, but the foods we eat today are not the foods nature intended for us.
[01:06:07.122 --> 01:06:08.823]  Fast food is toxic food.
[01:06:09.203 --> 01:06:12.826]  I've been producing MediCleanse for over 20 years, and customers from across the U.S.
[01:06:12.866 --> 01:06:21.131]  say that MediCleanse helps your body detoxify from fast foods as well as other environmental poisons, such as heavy metals and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.053]  For centuries, flax has been known as nature's superfood.
[01:06:24.533 --> 01:06:31.578]  Even the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:06:31.598 --> 01:06:36.061]  A one-month supply of MediCleanse is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:06:36.181 --> 01:06:42.026]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com for only $22.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:06:42.166 --> 01:06:43.086]  Or call me today at 1-800-317-9547.
[01:06:43.146 --> 01:06:43.326]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:06:43.407 --> 01:06:45.168]  Radiant health has never been easier.
[01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:59.557]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.742 --> 01:07:06.167]  Well, a month ago we launched the first money bomb and raised 4.2 plus mil.
[01:07:08.985 --> 01:07:12.148]  Well over a million dollars plus has been raised since then.
[01:07:12.609 --> 01:07:21.337]  Las Vegas is saying three to one odds in favor of Ron Paul and the grassroots campaign raising more than six million this weekend.
[01:07:22.058 --> 01:07:32.348]  When we conceived the idea here on air for the second money bomb with Trevor Lyman, I had pushed for the 15th and 16th because I saw things really build on November 5th.
[01:07:33.254 --> 01:07:35.596]  And then trail off.
[01:07:35.636 --> 01:07:52.448]  I think two days would cause more momentum, and that's what Trevor wanted to do, but kind of the group mind out there, which we kind of just let the campaign and the people, the grassroots, do what they want, said, no, we want just the 16th, that one day.
[01:07:53.249 --> 01:07:53.569]  Fine.
[01:07:54.519 --> 01:08:03.963]  It looks like, though, with 30,000-plus pledges at the TeaParty2007.com, that with 18,000 pledges, they raised $4.2 million.
[01:08:04.604 --> 01:08:07.825]  We're talking $6-7 million if trends follow.
[01:08:08.105 --> 01:08:11.287]  This will be an all-time record, not just pre-primary.
[01:08:11.507 --> 01:08:13.888]  Ron Paul's already got that record now by over $200,000.
[01:08:14.488 --> 01:08:17.189]  This will be, if he raises $7 million, $900,000 over Kerry's record during the campaign.
[01:08:23.570 --> 01:08:25.350]  There is no way to ignore that.
[01:08:26.351 --> 01:08:31.972]  They're playing a lot of dirty tricks right now, and we're going to talk about that in the second half of this interview with our guest.
[01:08:32.952 --> 01:08:40.434]  He is an eye surgeon, eye doctor, and he is the third son, or he's in the middle.
[01:08:40.474 --> 01:08:41.215]  There's three sons.
[01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:42.575]  He's in the middle of five children.
[01:08:43.335 --> 01:08:46.836]  He is Rand Paul, I guess, named after Anne Rand.
[01:08:48.155 --> 01:08:51.456]  And we are just really honored to have him on with us today.
[01:08:51.496 --> 01:08:53.756]  He is based in Bowling Green, Kentucky.
[01:08:54.176 --> 01:09:00.638]  Sir, thank you so much for coming on with us in the middle of your busy ophthalmologist schedule.
[01:09:01.158 --> 01:09:02.098]  Glad to be with you.
[01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:05.439]  You know, you mentioned Kerry having one of those fundraising records.
[01:09:05.639 --> 01:09:13.821]  What's extraordinary about Ron Paul is that my dad's raising it, and I don't think one person has given us money who wants something from government.
[01:09:14.381 --> 01:09:17.502]  They want to be left alone, but you know, the people who gave to Kerry
[01:09:18.078 --> 01:09:25.462]  Are people who get big contracts from government, the people who thought he was going to be the nominee, knew he was going to be the nominee, and they're buying influence.
[01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:34.106]  So it's extraordinary that our people give money because they want freedom, they want liberty, they want to be left alone, but they're not people who want a contract from government.
[01:09:34.126 --> 01:09:38.188]  There isn't one PAC that's given us any money that wants something from government.
[01:09:39.972 --> 01:09:43.853]  You know, talking to you, you sound so much like your dad.
[01:09:43.893 --> 01:09:44.434]  This is great.
[01:09:44.454 --> 01:09:47.795]  We have like a Ron Paul clone.
[01:09:50.096 --> 01:09:55.277]  You know what, before we get into the campaign and strategy, let's talk about Ron Paul behind the scenes.
[01:09:55.318 --> 01:09:56.418]  He's a very humble man.
[01:09:57.956 --> 01:10:02.857]  And most people, I mean, I've known your father for about 15 years, been very blessed to.
[01:10:03.117 --> 01:10:04.658]  You've known him, of course, since conception.
[01:10:05.338 --> 01:10:18.401]  Tell us about your father, his background, some stories, you know, some things about his life, things that shaped him, and then how that shaped you and the rest of your family because you're also involved fighting, you know, the IRS and for tax fairness and the rest of it.
[01:10:19.201 --> 01:10:21.922]  I believe you're the chairman of that there in your state, aren't you?
[01:10:22.302 --> 01:10:22.522]  Right.
[01:10:23.263 --> 01:10:28.446]  Well, you know, when I think back, I get these questions more often now about childhood and things about childhood.
[01:10:28.506 --> 01:10:36.290]  One of the things I remember is, you know, as a kid, I always liked listening to the adult conversation in politics, you know, ever since I was a small child.
[01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:41.473]  But we had this one friend that would come over that sticks in my memory, and his name was Pete Karpenko.
[01:10:41.493 --> 01:10:44.214]  He had actually fought in the Czar's Army.
[01:10:44.494 --> 01:10:48.536]  He was 14 years old when he fought in the Czar's Army against the Bolsheviks.
[01:10:49.237 --> 01:10:51.398]  And what always struck me was that
[01:10:51.946 --> 01:10:55.307]  You know, people think, oh, who are these people who support capitalism?
[01:10:55.347 --> 01:10:57.948]  Are they the rich and wealthy, the big business?
[01:10:58.348 --> 01:10:59.368]  You know, they were peasants.
[01:10:59.428 --> 01:11:04.729]  They were Ukrainian farmers and they had like a half an acre or less that they grew their own vegetables on.
[01:11:05.169 --> 01:11:10.431]  But they just knew instinctively that it was their land and that they weren't going to grow it for the commune.
[01:11:10.451 --> 01:11:14.492]  They knew that they didn't like the fact that the people around them quit working.
[01:11:14.592 --> 01:11:19.613]  Once everybody worked for the commune, only a few people worked and the rest just lived off the work of the others.
[01:11:20.154 --> 01:11:27.096]  But it's always interesting that the great defenders of capitalism, I still think it's true in our day and age, is that they're not big business.
[01:11:27.136 --> 01:11:28.476]  They're not the big corporations.
[01:11:28.856 --> 01:11:36.578]  They're the little guy who has a small business or may work for somebody else, but wants to be left alone, wants to keep more of the fruits of his labor.
[01:11:36.898 --> 01:11:42.520]  Well, big business, and I'm talking about the mega fortune 500, loves big government.
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:44.000]  They get the corporate welfare.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.881]  They use government to go after their competition.
[01:11:46.281 --> 01:11:47.101]  Can you speak to that?
[01:11:47.757 --> 01:11:59.846]  Yeah, as a child I was always perplexed by it, because I'd see these wealthy people in our country who gave to both sides, and I was always like, who could give $2,000 to the Republican candidate and the Democrat candidate?
[01:12:00.246 --> 01:12:02.448]  And it's that they don't care, they're buying influence.
[01:12:02.828 --> 01:12:07.011]  And that's been the whole problem with our society, and corporations have really done that.
[01:12:07.052 --> 01:12:11.515]  I mean, you look it out in Iowa, where all the candidates are afraid to be against ethanol,
[01:12:12.011 --> 01:12:15.733]  But do you think it's mom and pop getting an ethanol subsidy from the federal government?
[01:12:15.893 --> 01:12:21.116]  Heck no, it's ConAgra or somebody that has, you know, 100,000 acres out in Iowa.
[01:12:21.536 --> 01:12:22.657]  They're getting the subsidy.
[01:12:22.717 --> 01:12:25.038]  It's not mom and pop getting the federal subsidy.
[01:12:25.078 --> 01:12:26.319]  It's huge corporations.
[01:12:26.819 --> 01:12:27.780]  And they manipulate it.
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:39.166]  You know, I tell people this is true even in environmental matters, because we have people who are opening up to us on the war issue, opening up to us on personal freedoms, but then they're like, well, what do we do about the environment?
[01:12:39.557 --> 01:12:46.521]  And I try to tell them that, you know, you'd much rather your environment be controlled more locally because who do you think has more influence in Washington, D.C.?
[01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:55.947]  You know, Dow Chemicals people, their lobbyists trying to decide how many parts per million is appropriate pollution, or the little guy wanting to do something for the environment.
[01:12:56.307 --> 01:13:04.692]  So even for things like the environment, I think we have a message to people that, you know, you can control what happens to your environment probably much better at a local level than you can in Washington.
[01:13:06.218 --> 01:13:07.099]  Well, absolutely.
[01:13:07.239 --> 01:13:12.963]  And the modern environmental movement, we have the SPP documents, Judicial Watch got, we have Club of Rome documents.
[01:13:12.983 --> 01:13:19.649]  They've been saying for 40 years that the big global banks were going to use environmentalism to set up a new form of feudalism.
[01:13:20.538 --> 01:13:23.260]  Right, and I don't think there are people who truly care about the environment.
[01:13:41.075 --> 01:13:48.600]  I think what's interesting is, in the last two weeks, I've met with several people who are homeschoolers, but they're also environmentalists.
[01:13:48.620 --> 01:14:01.329]  They're environmentalists in the way that they drink raw milk, they like to have grass-fed beef, but these are personal decisions they're making about their health and their family, and they don't want government to come in and intrude on what they eat.
[01:14:01.349 --> 01:14:02.790]  Well, those are just average people.
[01:14:02.830 --> 01:14:03.570]  That's my listeners.
[01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:07.893]  They're not left-wing, they're not right-wing, they're informed, they're intelligent, they want liberty.
[01:14:09.135 --> 01:14:12.643]  But really, I'm going to squeeze it out of you, because Ron won't do it, and Rand, you're not doing it either.
[01:14:12.704 --> 01:14:14.428]  Tell me something about your dad growing up.
[01:14:14.468 --> 01:14:16.393]  I mean, tell us about what really makes him tick.
[01:14:18.104 --> 01:14:28.350]  Well, let's say he's the kind of guy that gets up early in the morning, goes for a two or three mile walk, comes back, reads ten newspapers, you know, continues working on reading a book.
[01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:34.013]  He's probably one of the most well-read and well-informed politicians you'll ever see.
[01:14:34.033 --> 01:14:40.777]  I think because of that, you see when you stand up and give a speech, you can see him talk for 30 or 40 minutes without notes.
[01:14:40.857 --> 01:14:46.180]  And there's, you know, most of the other candidates speak for five minutes, say nothing, and it all comes from a teleprompter.
[01:14:46.744 --> 01:14:49.065]  So I think those are things that I know about him.
[01:14:49.165 --> 01:14:51.487]  I think he's a fairly quiet person at home.
[01:14:51.527 --> 01:14:53.308]  He's not a confrontational person.
[01:14:53.868 --> 01:15:01.072]  In the debates, I think you see him a little more tenacious because he's got to be to stand up for things, you know, in a fighting sort of mode.
[01:15:01.452 --> 01:15:06.435]  But I think he prefers actually an interview mode, more like talking with you or talking with an interviewer.
[01:15:06.695 --> 01:15:12.718]  And it doesn't have to always be a sympathetic interviewer, but he wants honest questions and honest dialogue in order to try to enlighten
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:17.647]  People about the issues, but he's not someone who likes confrontation.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:25.606]  And I think in Congress, most other congressmen will tell you that he's fairly well-liked, even though they will say they may not be voting with him.
[01:15:25.987 --> 01:15:27.868]  I think he is well-liked among his colleagues.
[01:15:28.168 --> 01:15:39.738]  Now, Wikipedia talks about his parents, whose parents were German immigrants, coming to Pittsburgh, and of course, Ron, five years old, working in the family dairy.
[01:15:39.918 --> 01:15:42.801]  And again, we've analyzed every political angle, every attack.
[01:15:42.881 --> 01:15:45.523]  I mean, this audience, this is the core of Ron Paul's support.
[01:15:45.543 --> 01:15:46.464]  That's why I'm trying to flesh
[01:15:46.844 --> 01:15:48.485]  Some things out that people don't know.
[01:15:48.985 --> 01:15:51.647]  I mean, is that accurate in Wikipedia and things about your dad five years old?
[01:15:51.687 --> 01:15:52.587]  Yeah, very much so.
[01:15:53.568 --> 01:15:58.190]  His grandfather came to this country when he was 14, and his dad died.
[01:15:58.210 --> 01:15:59.851]  He came with him, and his dad died immediately.
[01:15:59.891 --> 01:16:02.952]  And the 14-year-old worked hard, sold vegetables.
[01:16:02.972 --> 01:16:13.438]  They had something they used to call truck farmers, and these were people that sort of had small trucks, and they transported produce from sort of the local farms to the little produce areas of the marketplace.
[01:16:14.248 --> 01:16:20.530]  And he worked hard and when he died, he had five acres and he gave one acre to each son.
[01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:26.931]  They all lived on the same road, Cresmont Drive and Green Tree, Pittsburgh, right around the suburb of Pittsburgh.
[01:16:28.051 --> 01:16:39.974]  They started a dairy in their garage and they kept it in their garage until the government made them move it out because the rules in the 1930s started getting more and more government involved with what you did with milk.
[01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:44.858]  And so, but they had actually the one of the first pasteurization machines in Pittsburgh.
[01:16:44.878 --> 01:16:52.343]  And so they were on the cutting edge of pasteurizing milk, which allowed milk to last longer and be distributed for longer distances.
[01:16:52.744 --> 01:16:54.245]  But yeah, he had strong work ethic.
[01:16:54.265 --> 01:16:57.607]  My mom always jokes that she was picked up for her first date in a milk truck.
[01:16:59.042 --> 01:17:10.987]  He always laughs about, you had to be pretty good at driving these things because the hills are pretty steep in Pittsburgh, but the way the clutch worked is you stood while you drove and you pushed the clutch straight down into the floorboard.
[01:17:11.007 --> 01:17:12.528]  It was interesting.
[01:17:12.568 --> 01:17:21.292]  I can't imagine doing that and trying to let off the clutch on a hill and shift into gear, but imagine that and your first date is in a milk truck.
[01:17:22.312 --> 01:17:23.152]  That's your mama.
[01:17:23.493 --> 01:17:24.513]  How is Carol doing?
[01:17:25.464 --> 01:17:26.445]  She's doing very well.
[01:17:26.525 --> 01:17:30.208]  She had to have a pacemaker put in when they were in Iowa.
[01:17:30.548 --> 01:17:45.901]  She'd been having some spells for a couple years and then she had a spell there and fortunately they found the problem and you know the good thing about getting a pacemaker is you're much safer once they find out that problem you get the pacemaker because it can control your heart rhythm when your body's not doing it appropriately.
[01:17:46.713 --> 01:17:48.294]  Absolutely, that's what I've seen in the literature.
[01:17:48.634 --> 01:17:51.056]  Okay, Dr. Paul, thank you for sharing that background.
[01:17:51.096 --> 01:17:53.437]  Your father, we've got about 30 minutes left with you.
[01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:54.158]  We're about to break.
[01:17:54.178 --> 01:17:58.200]  When we come back, because I don't do pre-interviews, what would you like to discuss?
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:00.702]  What do you think is most important right now for the listeners to be aware of?
[01:18:01.262 --> 01:18:04.144]  I think just the incredible energy we're seeing out there.
[01:18:04.164 --> 01:18:06.245]  I just met Trevor Lyman this weekend.
[01:18:06.586 --> 01:18:08.987]  I'd like to talk about some of the people I just met up in New Hampshire.
[01:18:09.007 --> 01:18:10.248]  I was there for the last two days.
[01:18:10.308 --> 01:18:11.729]  I just got back last night at midnight.
[01:18:13.197 --> 01:18:14.218]  We just talked to Trevor.
[01:18:14.238 --> 01:18:15.320]  He was just in the blimp.
[01:18:15.460 --> 01:18:16.481]  One banner has been delivered.
[01:18:16.501 --> 01:18:17.903]  The other banner is being delivered.
[01:18:18.423 --> 01:18:20.346]  It should be up in the air by the 15th or 16th.
[01:18:20.366 --> 01:18:23.269]  There's a northern coming in, but it's going to be in the air.
[01:18:24.751 --> 01:18:26.493]  Let's talk about that grassroots energy.
[01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:30.138]  If you're not aware, Dr. Rand Paul, of some of the new attack patterns.
[01:18:30.958 --> 01:18:33.360]  Uh, that, uh, they've been launching from the talking points.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:36.661]  I want to get your take on, uh, the things they're now saying.
[01:18:37.242 --> 01:18:43.505]  On the other side of this quick break, we're talking to Ron Paul's second son, third of five children, Rand Paul.
[01:18:43.845 --> 01:18:45.466]  And he's a doctor himself.
[01:18:45.966 --> 01:18:48.668]  We'll be right back, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:18:53.883 --> 01:19:00.085]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:00.545 --> 01:19:08.307]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:19:08.668 --> 01:19:16.490]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:21.571]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:19:21.912 --> 01:19:26.633]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:19:27.133 --> 01:19:30.994]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:19:31.474 --> 01:19:32.495]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:32.575 --> 01:19:36.676]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:19:37.076 --> 01:19:41.457]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:44.478]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[01:19:53.263 --> 01:19:58.746]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:19:59.186 --> 01:20:03.429]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:20:03.849 --> 01:20:10.693]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:20:11.133 --> 01:20:17.839]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:20:18.159 --> 01:20:19.780]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:23.263]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:20:23.543 --> 01:20:25.985]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[01:20:54.128 --> 01:21:03.193]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:21:03.453 --> 01:21:14.679]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:21:15.019 --> 01:21:20.722]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:21:20.962 --> 01:21:27.628]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:21:27.829 --> 01:21:34.655]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:21:34.935 --> 01:21:36.697]  Supercharge your gravity filter today!
[01:21:36.957 --> 01:21:38.999]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements

[01:21:53.112 --> 01:21:57.675]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:21:58.075 --> 01:22:01.016]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:22:01.337 --> 01:22:03.898]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:22:04.258 --> 01:22:09.081]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:22:09.461 --> 01:22:14.824]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:22:15.124 --> 01:22:18.106]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:22:18.286 --> 01:22:18.847]  We're good to go.
[01:22:41.684 --> 01:22:46.889]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:22:46.909 --> 01:22:47.249]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:22:47.289 --> 01:22:49.211]  Before you slip into unconsciousness I'd like to have a
[01:23:05.356 --> 01:23:08.879]  Dr. Rand Paul is our guest.
[01:23:09.199 --> 01:23:11.101]  He's the son of Dr. Ron Paul.
[01:23:27.672 --> 01:23:39.139]  Regardless if your father wins or not, and it's been said but I'll say it again, he's injecting real issues into a dead campaign process with all the other candidates singing basically off the same sheet of music.
[01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:52.146]  It is also growing the grassroots and even the mainstream media and political analysts say this shows a major shift, a realignment, and that what your father's doing and what the people are doing is just the beginning
[01:23:52.990 --> 01:23:57.854]  Of the people not trusting the two political parties anymore, and trying to go back towards liberty.
[01:23:57.874 --> 01:23:58.434]  Your comments?
[01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:02.577]  Well, I think you're exactly right, and I think it comes from both perspectives.
[01:24:02.617 --> 01:24:19.449]  You know, there's the traditional limited government type people from the conservative angle, then there's people coming from the liberal angle, from the libertarian angle, from all different angles that may not necessarily agree on everything, but they are sort of part of this leave me alone coalition, and they're fed up with the Republican Party.
[01:24:19.509 --> 01:24:19.729]  I mean,
[01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:25.170]  Republican Party platform's not that bad for the most part, but they have never adhered to it.
[01:24:25.610 --> 01:24:32.012]  I always make the comment, which I think is sort of appropriate, the Soviets used to always talk about five-year agricultural plans.
[01:24:32.452 --> 01:24:36.574]  It was always a joke, because no one believed them, and by year two or three they always had to redo all the numbers.
[01:24:36.974 --> 01:24:42.076]  But we always have presidents that are elected, most of them have been Republicans, who have a five-year plan for balancing the budget.
[01:24:42.441 --> 01:24:45.204]  Well, it's just like the Soviet agricultural plan.
[01:24:45.524 --> 01:24:49.248]  A year or two into it, they have to admit that they really had no intention of doing it.
[01:24:49.268 --> 01:24:53.071]  Then you have to change the numbers to try to sort of fit reality again.
[01:24:53.392 --> 01:24:57.135]  You know, one great thing about your father is that he is a stalwart.
[01:24:57.256 --> 01:24:58.457]  He is very loyal.
[01:24:58.777 --> 01:25:00.399]  He does what he says he's going to do.
[01:25:00.419 --> 01:25:04.623]  You know, hence the name Dr. No, saying no to bad legislation.
[01:25:05.519 --> 01:25:08.620]  So he'd already booked months ago where he was going to be this weekend.
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:17.344]  It looks like right now, you were telling me during the break, he may not be able to be in Boston this weekend for the Tea Party, but his doppelganger Rand Paul is going to be there.
[01:25:17.964 --> 01:25:20.365]  Yeah, see, well, I'm sad that he's not going to be there.
[01:25:20.405 --> 01:25:22.946]  You know, I am glad that I get to give the big speech.
[01:25:22.986 --> 01:25:25.627]  So I've been preparing my speech for a couple of days now.
[01:25:25.887 --> 01:25:30.929]  See, most of the time if he's there, I get to give the introduction, you know, but I get to give the big thing this time, Seth.
[01:25:31.388 --> 01:25:33.269]  I think we'll have a thousand people or more there.
[01:25:33.329 --> 01:25:44.436]  The venue only holds about a thousand, but I have a feeling they're going to be turning people away, and I have this image in my mind of this Ron Paul blimp dumping tea into the bay, into the harbor.
[01:25:44.936 --> 01:25:48.018]  So this is really exciting what's going on.
[01:25:48.038 --> 01:25:58.964]  I was just up there Monday and Tuesday in New Hampshire, and it's hard sometimes to put into words, to transcribe, to describe sort of the energy of the grassroots.
[01:25:59.369 --> 01:26:01.731]  When I was up there I met Trevor Lyman for the first time.
[01:26:01.751 --> 01:26:14.962]  Here's a guy, never registered to vote, 37 years old, never voted, never participated in campaign, gets so enthralled by the Ron Paul liberty message that he's out there and helps us raise 4.3 million dollars in one day and now
[01:26:15.609 --> 01:26:17.130]  There's a reasonable chance.
[01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:22.915]  I mean, the media are looking at this and saying, there's a reasonable chance we raise $6 million in one day coming up.
[01:26:23.215 --> 01:26:26.057]  And Rand, I'm not tooting my own horn here.
[01:26:26.097 --> 01:26:31.702]  This is for the listeners out there on the 60-plus affiliates we've got who are listening to me, AMF and Shortwave Internet.
[01:26:33.483 --> 01:26:34.564]  Trevor Lyman woke up
[01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:36.593]  Well, here's a good example of how some of them are.
[01:26:36.613 --> 01:26:38.414]  I mean, I'm meeting some of these listeners everywhere I go.
[01:26:58.231 --> 01:26:59.833]  I was up in New Hampshire.
[01:26:59.893 --> 01:27:04.038]  I met three people from Oklahoma that are staying through the end of the campaign.
[01:27:04.439 --> 01:27:08.104]  I met two people from Kentucky that I'd already met in Kentucky who were up there.
[01:27:08.124 --> 01:27:10.767]  I met another gentleman from San Antonio.
[01:27:10.787 --> 01:27:13.771]  I met another person from New York State.
[01:27:14.505 --> 01:27:16.646]  People from all over the country are going up there.
[01:27:16.686 --> 01:27:19.068]  There's another young man who quit Google.
[01:27:19.088 --> 01:27:20.628]  I don't know if you've talked about him or not.
[01:27:20.689 --> 01:27:22.930]  Vijay, I think his last name is Boyapati.
[01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:24.030]  Yeah, tell folks about that.
[01:27:24.591 --> 01:27:25.491]  He quit Google.
[01:27:25.791 --> 01:27:29.654]  I'm sure he was a well-rewarded and paid employee of Google.
[01:27:29.674 --> 01:27:30.874]  He's a computer scientist.
[01:27:31.294 --> 01:27:32.515]  Very intelligent young man.
[01:27:32.915 --> 01:27:34.576]  Believes in this message so much.
[01:27:34.796 --> 01:27:37.518]  Quits Google out in California and is working on this full-time.
[01:27:37.538 --> 01:27:41.080]  I think he works with Trevor on some of these ideas, like the blimp.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:42.761]  I think they're also working on Operation
[01:27:43.423 --> 01:27:44.004]  I don't think so.
[01:27:54.952 --> 01:28:00.957]  And I'm not sure if they're raising money to actually... I think they've got houses to actually give people a place to stay and help people get there.
[01:28:00.977 --> 01:28:04.761]  Well, this has all the feelings of the Revolutionary War, but it's an info war.
[01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:13.048]  This electricity, this liberty, absolutely challenging the establishment like a swarm of X-Wings going in against the Death Star.
[01:28:13.877 --> 01:28:16.958]  Yeah, it is bigger than anybody ever imagined.
[01:28:16.998 --> 01:28:18.958]  It's bigger than my dad imagined it would be.
[01:28:19.018 --> 01:28:20.598]  It's bigger than I ever imagined it would be.
[01:28:20.618 --> 01:28:28.520]  I told Trevor when I met him yesterday, and we happened to be waiting in the airport last night, and I said, Trevor, you know, I read all your stuff.
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:31.720]  I saw that you were going to do this, and you know, I wasn't out there.
[01:28:32.100 --> 01:28:36.221]  I said, you know, I can't believe this is going to happen, and I just had almost forgot about it.
[01:28:36.241 --> 01:28:38.481]  I clicked back on the website, and it said two million.
[01:28:38.841 --> 01:28:40.742]  I clicked on it an hour later, it said four million.
[01:28:40.762 --> 01:28:41.162]  Stay there.
[01:28:41.182 --> 01:28:42.002]  We're going to be right back.
[01:28:42.042 --> 01:28:42.402]  Stay there.
[01:28:43.957 --> 01:28:46.961]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.883 --> 01:28:50.586]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.179 --> 01:28:57.520]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:04.762]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:29:05.142 --> 01:29:17.625]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:29:17.865 --> 01:29:20.506]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:29:20.846 --> 01:29:27.029]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:29:27.269 --> 01:29:32.412]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:29:32.672 --> 01:29:40.916]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:29:41.136 --> 01:29:41.777]  And the best part?

[01:30:04.009 --> 01:30:04.329]  Hemp.
[01:30:04.629 --> 01:30:11.115]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:30:11.455 --> 01:30:14.718]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:30:14.978 --> 01:30:18.562]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[01:30:19.142 --> 01:30:30.253]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.

[01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:36.959]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[01:30:53.633 --> 01:30:54.093]  Hi, Ken.
[01:30:54.154 --> 01:30:54.934]  It's Judy again.
[01:30:54.954 --> 01:30:59.478]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:30:59.638 --> 01:31:02.780]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:04.882]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:31:05.162 --> 01:31:07.244]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:31:07.424 --> 01:31:13.528]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:19.013]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:31:19.273 --> 01:31:22.135]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:31:22.275 --> 01:31:23.196]  Go KenSolar!
[01:31:24.477 --> 01:31:25.998]  Get the best of both worlds.

[01:32:15.226 --> 01:32:15.826]  Welcome back.
[01:32:15.906 --> 01:32:17.447]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:32:18.468 --> 01:32:28.896]  We're talking to Dr. Rand Paul, one of the five great children that Dr. Ron Paul, the Congressman hailing from the great state of Texas, has had.
[01:32:29.516 --> 01:32:37.622]  And he is a eye surgeon, doctor, in his own right, ophthalmologist, and we are honored to have him with us for one more segment.
[01:32:38.237 --> 01:32:38.938]  Here's the deal.
[01:32:39.358 --> 01:32:40.540]  I haven't opened the phones up today.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.784]  I'm going to open them up in about five minutes and specifically on the campaign.
[01:32:44.824 --> 01:32:49.369]  We don't normally control what you can talk about, but we don't have a lot of time here left.
[01:32:49.749 --> 01:32:55.295]  So I want to just specifically hear about the campaign or Ron Paul or any questions for Ron Paul, his son.
[01:32:56.521 --> 01:32:56.941]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:56.961 --> 01:32:57.922]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:59.683 --> 01:33:04.345]  You were talking about excitement.
[01:33:04.385 --> 01:33:06.806]  You were talking about on November 5th, it's one million.
[01:33:06.826 --> 01:33:08.767]  You come back a few hours later, it's two million.
[01:33:08.987 --> 01:33:09.707]  Please continue.
[01:33:10.688 --> 01:33:15.930]  Convinced that there was something wrong with the ticker because I could not imagine that much money coming in that fast.
[01:33:16.770 --> 01:33:19.752]  And it just amazes and boggles my mind.
[01:33:20.292 --> 01:33:22.113]  It's also amazing where it's coming from, too.
[01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:24.794]  I meet 17-year-old kids who are giving money.
[01:33:25.256 --> 01:33:29.018]  Who's ever heard of a 17-year-old kid who gives money to a political candidate?
[01:33:29.599 --> 01:33:38.385]  Yesterday, we had lunch in Portsmouth, and two parents were there with their 19-year-old, and they said, yeah, when he was 16, he turned us on to Ron Paul.
[01:33:38.785 --> 01:33:40.806]  You know, their kids are turning on the parents.
[01:33:40.846 --> 01:33:42.947]  I had the same episode at church here in town.
[01:33:44.128 --> 01:33:49.232]  Family came up to us and said, oh, yep, our 17-year-old has Ron Paul bumper stickers and knows all about him.
[01:33:49.252 --> 01:33:51.233]  He wants us to get involved with a campaign.
[01:33:51.863 --> 01:33:57.205]  My dad talks about teenagers coming to these rallies and saying, yeah, I brought my parents with me today.
[01:33:57.225 --> 01:34:00.066]  You know, what an extraordinary thing happening.
[01:34:00.086 --> 01:34:03.348]  You know, he gets up in one of my favorite lines that he does now.
[01:34:03.468 --> 01:34:07.990]  He gets up in front of the crowd and he'll say, looks like we've got a pretty diverse crowd here today.
[01:34:08.010 --> 01:34:15.873]  It looks like we might even have a few Republicans out there because we have so many people from different walks of life.
[01:34:15.953 --> 01:34:18.554]  I go into the office in Concord yesterday.
[01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:24.511]  And I said hello to the different people working the phones and one guy says, yeah, I was a Democrat until a month ago.
[01:34:24.591 --> 01:34:25.252]  I've switched.
[01:34:25.792 --> 01:34:32.774]  He says, I'm a veteran and my son's in Iraq right now, but I think the Iraq war is a mistake and we need to change the policy.
[01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:37.355]  Which kind of goes along with the fact that people think, oh, you're against the war, you're against the soldiers.
[01:34:37.715 --> 01:34:38.695]  That's ridiculous.
[01:34:38.875 --> 01:34:44.797]  The thing is, is that we're now getting more money from active military than any other candidate, including John McCain.
[01:34:46.292 --> 01:34:51.917]  Well, McCain really stuck his foot in his mouth with that one, and then the whole crowd booed him in two sustained boos.
[01:34:52.438 --> 01:34:54.960]  Yeah, I think McCain's on his way out.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.783]  I really think he's going to get really swamped in Iowa.
[01:34:58.143 --> 01:35:01.046]  I'm very, very hopeful that he's behind us in New Hampshire.
[01:35:01.919 --> 01:35:06.203]  And that if he doesn't do well in South Carolina, McCain could be going after three primaries.
[01:35:06.503 --> 01:35:06.783]  I agree.
[01:35:06.803 --> 01:35:13.388]  There's a new stratagem, Fox News, national and local, and I've seen it in news articles being written.
[01:35:13.788 --> 01:35:29.180]  It's definitely a talking point of many they've tried on the congressman and of course the grassroots campaign to restore the republic, restore the liberty to this once great nation, and of course our name worldwide as well that's been drugged to the mud by the neocons and the liberals.
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:39.827]  Their new tactic is to say, yeah, Ron Paul was doing good, but he's stalled now, his numbers are going down, and the Libertarians are talking about him going over there, and, you know, it's just basically over for him.
[01:35:39.847 --> 01:35:53.637]  It's kind of like Mark Twain saying, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated, and so they're really pulling out the stops now, just saying he's not a viable candidate, when his trajectory shows him going straight up.
[01:35:54.510 --> 01:35:56.131]  Yeah, ours is exponential.
[01:35:56.171 --> 01:35:58.513]  You know, we've doubled the amount we've raised each quarter.
[01:35:58.533 --> 01:36:07.398]  There's a very good chance, if this money bomb is successful, that we will raise more money in this quarter than any candidate, any Republican candidate.
[01:36:07.538 --> 01:36:10.540]  All the Republicans' numbers have gradually dwindled.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:13.041]  They raised more in the first quarter than they did in the third quarter.
[01:36:13.462 --> 01:36:18.745]  So their numbers are dwindling, and right now we're almost up to $12 million without the money bomb.
[01:36:18.765 --> 01:36:22.687]  If we added the money bomb and we have $6 million, we're up to almost $18 million at that point.
[01:36:24.167 --> 01:36:29.989]  I think that will turn so many heads that Fox News won't be able to spin it any other way.
[01:36:30.029 --> 01:36:45.154]  They may try, but they won't be able to spin it any other way that raising that kind of money, particularly when he's getting one one-hundredth of the media time and he's not offering anything to anybody, no federal money for contracts or this and that, no special interest money.
[01:36:45.674 --> 01:36:48.255]  You know, to raise that kind of money from individuals who are given $20, $40, $50, $100,
[01:36:51.994 --> 01:36:55.887]  You know, it's extraordinary and the media is catching on to some of that.
[01:36:56.429 --> 01:36:59.037]  Well, I said this earlier, but I'm going to say it again because it's so key.
[01:37:00.123 --> 01:37:07.108]  Only Ron Paul of all the Republican candidates, and all the polls show this, it's elementary math, can beat Hillary Clinton.
[01:37:07.128 --> 01:37:12.371]  He's the only one that'll get Libertarians and Democrats and anti-war people and bring them over.
[01:37:12.712 --> 01:37:22.898]  And as Ron Paul's been saying on these television shows, he's been warning Republicans, hey, you're going to lose if you don't have an anti-war candidate, and I'm the only one on the Republican ticket.
[01:37:23.158 --> 01:37:24.700]  Most of the Democrats are pro-war.
[01:37:25.380 --> 01:37:27.621]  This is the time to get behind Ron Paul.
[01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:29.783]  But meanwhile, Pat Robertson endorses
[01:37:30.283 --> 01:37:36.929]  I think it's just mostly disappointing for Pat Robertson because I think his followers will, you know, be really, really disappointed to see that
[01:37:54.648 --> 01:38:00.812]  It's more important for him to assassinate Chavez than it is to be supporting anybody who's socially conservative.
[01:38:01.292 --> 01:38:06.075]  So I just think it really, really does discredit to Robertson to have endorsed Giuliani.
[01:38:06.355 --> 01:38:08.737]  And I think that's what I hear throughout the Christian community.
[01:38:08.777 --> 01:38:09.657]  They can't believe it.
[01:38:10.057 --> 01:38:13.279]  And really, Robertson will come out of this with almost no credibility.
[01:38:13.780 --> 01:38:15.821]  Well, he already said abortion was good in China in 2000.
[01:38:15.881 --> 01:38:24.086]  Yeah, I think, you know, maybe there's something going on there that we don't understand, but he's losing his credibility by it.
[01:38:24.848 --> 01:38:28.631]  Um, you know, I think it'll be interesting to see what happens, particularly the war issue.
[01:38:28.651 --> 01:38:35.095]  I think you're right that the war has become so unpopular, 65 to 70% of people against it.
[01:38:35.455 --> 01:38:41.539]  And on the Republican side, not only do they have any idea about ending the Iraq war, they all want to invade Iran next.
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.042]  I tell people in speeches, I say, you know, we're against the Iraq war.
[01:38:45.062 --> 01:38:47.463]  We have been to the beginning, but you know, we're also against the Iran war.
[01:38:47.744 --> 01:38:49.125]  You know, the one that hasn't started yet.
[01:38:49.745 --> 01:38:50.906]  So, um,
[01:38:51.775 --> 01:39:00.777]  You know, the thing is, I think people want to paint my father into some corner, but if you look at it intellectually, look at the evidence that Iran is not a threat.
[01:39:01.237 --> 01:39:04.038]  Iran cannot even refine their own gasoline.
[01:39:04.118 --> 01:39:06.779]  Over 50% of their gasoline is imported from Europe.
[01:39:07.539 --> 01:39:16.441]  General Abizaid, who's no left-wing nut, was head of the theater over there, retires recently, and he says, look, we should discourage them from having a nuclear weapon, but if they should get one,
[01:39:16.926 --> 01:39:18.186]  It is not necessary.
[01:39:18.247 --> 01:39:20.047]  They are not a threat to our national security.
[01:39:20.247 --> 01:39:24.989]  The CIA's own national assessment says they're not going to have one for eight years.
[01:39:25.269 --> 01:39:27.910]  Yeah, if we could just get Mike Huckabee to understand what that is.
[01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:30.591]  I'm not sure he knows what the National Intelligent Testament is.
[01:39:31.131 --> 01:39:32.331]  But you're right.
[01:39:32.472 --> 01:39:36.493]  Even our own intelligence community's consensus opinion now is that they're not a threat.
[01:39:36.513 --> 01:39:38.574]  I mean, my dad says they don't have an Air Force.
[01:39:38.614 --> 01:39:39.714]  They don't have a Navy.
[01:39:40.114 --> 01:39:42.255]  You know, it's ridiculous to think
[01:39:42.845 --> 01:39:45.828]  That they're a threat to our national security.
[01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:49.152]  It's not even that viable to say they're a national threat to Israel.
[01:39:49.493 --> 01:39:52.015]  Most people say Israel has 100 nuclear weapons.
[01:39:52.376 --> 01:39:59.424]  Rand, two final questions and I want to jam in four or five calls quickly in the nine minutes we have left with you today, sir.
[01:40:00.459 --> 01:40:03.661]  Another big thing your father's been talking about for 25-30 years.
[01:40:03.701 --> 01:40:11.266]  There's videos from 28 years ago of him on television talking about they've taken the dollar off of silver, off of gold.
[01:40:11.946 --> 01:40:13.187]  It's going to be devalued.
[01:40:13.267 --> 01:40:14.428]  Money is now political.
[01:40:14.768 --> 01:40:17.069]  He's been talking about it intensely the last five years.
[01:40:17.509 --> 01:40:21.432]  Now Americans are just now realizing that the dollar is sinking.
[01:40:22.252 --> 01:40:26.537]  And could continue to sink to peso or ruble-like levels.
[01:40:26.937 --> 01:40:37.667]  And so that's another big point here, is you're right, your father is a historian, you know, late-trained, but I've talked to him many times, I've seen him on history, very accurate, very intelligent.
[01:40:38.188 --> 01:40:45.875]  He is self-trained in economics, gotten awards from the Von Mies Institute and other prestigious organizations for his contributions to economic thought.
[01:40:46.375 --> 01:40:49.539]  I mean, this guy, he's much smarter than John Kennedy.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:54.345]  And I've analyzed the writings and speeches of Kennedy, and he was probably one of the smartest presidents this century.
[01:40:54.886 --> 01:40:57.009]  Bill Clinton's very smart, but he's also very evil.
[01:40:57.249 --> 01:40:59.612]  Your father is more intelligent than both those men.
[01:40:59.632 --> 01:41:01.795]  I mean, this is pure statesman.
[01:41:01.975 --> 01:41:03.477]  This is founding father material.
[01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:05.099]  Can you talk about the economic stance?
[01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:12.333]  Well, I think one of the things that I always mention to people about the dollars is, in very simple terms, we import much more than we export.
[01:41:12.473 --> 01:41:15.935]  So when we buy goods from overseas, we send dollars overseas.
[01:41:16.356 --> 01:41:20.398]  Because the dollar has been respected, we're able to basically export our inflation.
[01:41:20.818 --> 01:41:25.841]  Those dollars don't come back immediately to chase our goods, so inflation has been relatively low.
[01:41:25.881 --> 01:41:27.522]  We still have it, but relatively low.
[01:41:27.842 --> 01:41:33.506]  But the whole thing is, it's a house of cards, and it depends on confidence of all these other countries
[01:41:34.053 --> 01:41:40.739]  Not only to keep those dollars in their circulation or in their central banks, but also to use them to buy treasury bills to finance our debt.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.881]  My dad makes the point very succinctly.
[01:41:43.181 --> 01:41:46.284]  We can only fight the Iraq War by borrowing money from the Chinese.
[01:41:46.344 --> 01:41:47.265]  How scary is that?
[01:41:47.605 --> 01:41:52.610]  What happens when the Chinese quit buying our debt or start buying euros or start buying gold instead?
[01:41:53.174 --> 01:41:54.034]  And you're seeing some of that.
[01:41:54.054 --> 01:41:55.555]  I mean, the price of gold has doubled.
[01:41:55.615 --> 01:41:59.516]  You know, the value of the euro has doubled, probably, almost, against the dollar.
[01:41:59.837 --> 01:42:05.018]  So we live in uncertain times, and it is not a given that the dollar will always be accepted.
[01:42:05.459 --> 01:42:08.480]  It is pretty much a given, though, that if the dollar fails, not only does the U.S.
[01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:10.020]  fail, the entire world will fail.
[01:42:10.621 --> 01:42:11.281]  Absolutely.
[01:42:11.321 --> 01:42:16.483]  So the strategy is we need to get into double digits in New Hampshire.
[01:42:16.503 --> 01:42:19.684]  Iowa has been bought up by the big party machine.
[01:42:19.724 --> 01:42:20.544]  That doesn't really matter.
[01:42:21.224 --> 01:42:22.425]  In 60 seconds, what's the strategy?
[01:42:23.698 --> 01:42:27.200]  Not only double digits in New Hampshire, that's sort of a one-week strategy.
[01:42:27.260 --> 01:42:29.021]  The strategy is to win New Hampshire.
[01:42:29.442 --> 01:42:30.662]  And I'm not a Pollyanna.
[01:42:30.702 --> 01:42:33.604]  I'm not somebody who really just says things I don't believe.
[01:42:34.044 --> 01:42:36.165]  I think we have a chance of winning in New Hampshire.
[01:42:36.205 --> 01:42:37.606]  There's incredible energy up there.
[01:42:38.087 --> 01:42:47.012]  And the main thing we have going for us is 45% of the people are independent, can go into either primary, and the vast majority of independents are opposed to the war.
[01:42:47.472 --> 01:42:51.234]  If we can let enough of them know that we're their real answer for leaving Iraq,
[01:42:51.721 --> 01:42:56.066]  I mean, look, you've got Hillary Clinton says we're not going to leave until 2013 in her second term.
[01:42:56.546 --> 01:42:59.629]  You've got Barack Obama who keeps voting for all the war funding.
[01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:04.314]  You know, really, if their choice is for ending the war, Ron Paul's the only choice.
[01:43:04.394 --> 01:43:07.618]  He is the only choice to do that and to beat Hillary, the warmonger.
[01:43:08.488 --> 01:43:17.937]  I have no doubt Ron Paul is going to win the exit polls, which have always been accurate until magically these special machines with their own engineers have gone public saying they were hired to engage in stealing elections.
[01:43:18.838 --> 01:43:23.122]  The congressman, you know, doesn't like to be a spoiled sport or discourage people.
[01:43:23.342 --> 01:43:24.383]  I think everybody should vote.
[01:43:24.423 --> 01:43:25.103]  We should fight.
[01:43:25.143 --> 01:43:26.204]  They can't steal at all.
[01:43:26.765 --> 01:43:29.868]  But aren't you a little bit worried about those special machines?
[01:43:30.575 --> 01:43:35.636]  Well, I guess I'm mostly worried about just sort of corruption in general and people stealing votes.
[01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:37.657]  I mean, they steal them in multiple different ways.
[01:43:38.297 --> 01:43:47.599]  Back in LBJ's day, he was stealing them by buying the chairman of the county and getting all the votes, and they were paper ballots, you know, so you can steal votes anytime you have corruption.
[01:43:48.199 --> 01:43:54.440]  I think being conscious of trying to change our system, and I've talked with the people who want to change away from computer back to paper.
[01:43:54.460 --> 01:43:57.641]  You know, New Hampshire has paper ballots, which I think is good.
[01:43:58.555 --> 01:44:00.437]  The whole thing is it's a long-term fight.
[01:44:00.457 --> 01:44:04.422]  You won't change that in one election if you want to change away from the system.
[01:44:04.743 --> 01:44:15.978]  But what you can do in an immediate election is go to the campaign, if you're near New Hampshire, in New Hampshire, Iowa, or one of these early states, South Carolina, is you go to the campaign and say, look, I want to be a poll watcher.
[01:44:16.414 --> 01:44:21.337]  When you stand there in front of them, they may try to steal votes, but it's much harder with someone standing there.
[01:44:21.377 --> 01:44:22.037]  Absolutely.
[01:44:23.077 --> 01:44:25.379]  When they come against us with tyranny, we don't back off.
[01:44:25.419 --> 01:44:26.759]  We engage them even more.
[01:44:27.059 --> 01:44:31.242]  This is all part of a process of growing our collective muscles to fight tyranny.
[01:44:31.542 --> 01:44:33.643]  Bob in California, then Tony and Paul.
[01:44:33.723 --> 01:44:34.923]  It's all the time we have for calls.
[01:44:35.224 --> 01:44:36.004]  Bob, you're on the air.
[01:44:36.044 --> 01:44:36.484]  Go ahead.
[01:44:36.504 --> 01:44:39.386]  Yes, my question is, has your dad made any...
[01:44:40.589 --> 01:44:50.832]  Statements regarding about the Federal Reserve versus what what Kennedy wanted to do putting us back on our own dollars and get rid of the Federal Reserve and the other thing about this statement that he made about the IRS
[01:44:51.816 --> 01:44:53.897]  Uh, reforming the IRS and getting rid of it.
[01:44:54.217 --> 01:44:58.098]  That's the only thing that the press could come up with is say, well, look what this guy says.
[01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:00.579]  He's going to get rid of the IRS in 30 days.
[01:45:00.659 --> 01:45:03.640]  I think he needs to point out, he's not going to get rid of the IRS in 30 days.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.940]  He said he's going to phase it out.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:05.720]  Exactly.
[01:45:05.820 --> 01:45:07.901]  But the press is saying it sounds like he's going to try it.
[01:45:08.061 --> 01:45:10.181]  He's a nutcase because he's going to do it in 30 days.
[01:45:10.722 --> 01:45:12.402]  Well, we can address those both.
[01:45:12.502 --> 01:45:13.542]  First, the IRS.
[01:45:13.582 --> 01:45:15.463]  He does want to eliminate the income tax.
[01:45:15.976 --> 01:45:25.920]  That would take either a majority of Congress to vote that through, or a change in the Constitution, although I think a lot of people think you could get rid of the income tax with legislation.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:35.504]  One point about is that a reasonable or an unreasonable thing, if you introduce next year in 2008, if you introduce the budget from the year 2000,
[01:45:36.929 --> 01:45:39.812]  You would actually be able to have a government without an income tax.
[01:45:39.992 --> 01:45:41.733]  That's how fast government is growing.
[01:45:41.994 --> 01:45:45.116]  Bob, this is how Ron Paul should answer, because I've got the numbers.
[01:45:45.156 --> 01:45:45.857]  I know he knows this.
[01:45:45.897 --> 01:45:46.518]  He's written about it.
[01:45:47.198 --> 01:45:52.062]  On average, this country had zero inflation from 1789 until about 1890.
[01:45:53.344 --> 01:45:54.264]  Zero inflation.
[01:45:54.284 --> 01:45:57.507]  In fact, some years, the dollar actually gained value.
[01:45:59.173 --> 01:46:03.577]  We had, on average, a 10% growth rate for that 150 plus years.
[01:46:03.937 --> 01:46:06.419]  Now we have a fake 3% growth rate.
[01:46:06.679 --> 01:46:07.000]  Okay?
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:10.322]  We built this country without the stinking income tax of the foreign bankers.
[01:46:10.583 --> 01:46:10.943]  Rand?
[01:46:13.445 --> 01:46:15.887]  Yeah, we can definitely eliminate the income tax.
[01:46:16.167 --> 01:46:26.816]  All these things will more than likely require congressional authority anyway, so he can't do any of this by himself, but he can definitely say that that's what he's in favor of and how quickly we can do it.
[01:46:26.856 --> 01:46:27.957]  Let's say, for example,
[01:46:28.447 --> 01:46:35.631]  The average income tax might be thirty percent, because you get rid of ten percent a year over three years, or, you know, five percent a year over six years.
[01:46:35.971 --> 01:46:38.913]  You know, gradualism versus immediately doing things.
[01:46:39.614 --> 01:46:42.595]  In our political world, there probably will have to be some gradualism.
[01:46:42.675 --> 01:46:43.976]  It's also more stable.
[01:46:44.537 --> 01:46:50.860]  If you don't immediately start doing something, if you have somebody who says, in my second term I might do this, it's never going to happen.
[01:46:50.980 --> 01:46:53.562]  Ron will immediately start the process of these things.
[01:46:53.742 --> 01:46:55.103]  Tony in Arkansas, go ahead.
[01:46:55.723 --> 01:46:56.683]  Honored to talk with both of you.
[01:46:56.723 --> 01:46:58.084]  Greetings from the land of Huckabee.
[01:46:58.184 --> 01:47:07.346]  The manufacture rise of Mike Huckabee in the media is in direct result of the fact that none of these other neocon candidates could get traction.
[01:47:07.426 --> 01:47:08.727]  Your dad is moving up.
[01:47:09.247 --> 01:47:12.828]  He was the only true conservative and it was beginning and is continuing to break through.
[01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:15.289]  So now they're manufacturing this to rally.
[01:47:15.609 --> 01:47:16.369]  I used to be one.
[01:47:16.389 --> 01:47:18.510]  A Republican, you know, just died in the wool.
[01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:20.110]  A conservative listened to Rush Limbaugh.
[01:47:20.370 --> 01:47:29.516]  They're trying to get them to rally to Huckabee and that is directly a deception, obviously, to try and draw away from your father's true independent meteoric rise.
[01:47:29.676 --> 01:47:32.258]  Every story I've listened to, CNN the last few days and others,
[01:47:32.662 --> 01:47:35.024]  Yeah, and I tend to not really believe that Huckabee could have risen so fast.
[01:47:35.044 --> 01:47:36.765]  Because, you know, even a week ago they had him going from 8 to 17.
[01:47:56.838 --> 01:48:02.021]  But then a week later, having gone from 17 to 33 in Iowa, there's just no way that's true.
[01:48:02.041 --> 01:48:09.646]  I don't intend to believe that some of it is manufactured, and they've decided upon him to try to coalesce some of their people together into one candidate.
[01:48:09.966 --> 01:48:10.347]  I agree.
[01:48:10.367 --> 01:48:12.108]  Last call for Rand Paul.
[01:48:12.668 --> 01:48:13.889]  Paul and Matt, go ahead.
[01:48:14.449 --> 01:48:24.816]  Yeah, I've read documents saying that, I mean, press releases saying that he was only going to run one term if he gets elected, and I was just wondering if that was true, if he only plans on running for one term.
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:27.181]  No, I don't think that would be true.
[01:48:27.201 --> 01:48:32.286]  I've never heard him ask that question, but I can't imagine that if we won, we'd quit after four years.
[01:48:32.326 --> 01:48:34.487]  We'd won all eight years if we could get it.
[01:48:34.748 --> 01:48:37.170]  So there's no way I think he would quit after four years.
[01:48:38.831 --> 01:48:39.572]  Anything else, Paul?
[01:48:40.392 --> 01:48:41.033]  No, that's all.
[01:48:41.853 --> 01:48:44.415]  I just read those and wanted to verify if they were true or not.
[01:48:44.456 --> 01:48:44.936]  Thank you.
[01:48:45.116 --> 01:48:47.798]  We can go back to the Federal Reserve if you want for a minute.
[01:48:47.998 --> 01:48:48.599]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.679 --> 01:48:50.581]  The Federal Reserve's the same sort of thing.
[01:48:50.621 --> 01:48:54.744]  I mean, some people say, would there be, you know, chaos if we got rid of the Federal Reserve?
[01:48:55.086 --> 01:49:05.850]  Well, part of one way or one avenue towards gradualism is that he believes in allowing competing currencies, and that would be legalizing contracts in gold and silver.
[01:49:06.331 --> 01:49:18.896]  Right now, I think you can make a contract in gold and silver, but the problem is, is if the price of gold goes from $400 to $800, they're going to charge you taxes on that dollar, nominal dollar capital in gold.
[01:49:19.376 --> 01:49:21.617]  And so it's hard to make contracts in gold right now.
[01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:27.090]  And even though I think people have tried it, you have to change the tax structure to allow competing currencies.
[01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:37.934]  Dr. Rand Paul, son of Ron Paul, you're going to be speaking coming up in Boston for the Money Bomb Boston Tea Party anniversary in the true spirit of America and liberty.
[01:49:38.634 --> 01:49:39.655]  Sir, go with God.
[01:49:39.695 --> 01:49:40.875]  We've been very honored to have you.
[01:49:40.895 --> 01:49:42.076]  Thanks for having me.
[01:49:42.516 --> 01:49:42.996]  Take care.
[01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:47.018]  We'll be right back with more news, your calls, and another special guest.
[01:49:47.218 --> 01:49:47.638]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.295 --> 01:49:55.696]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.716 --> 01:49:57.817]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.538 --> 01:50:02.960]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of governments.
[01:50:03.441 --> 01:50:05.162]  It's known as the Builderbirds.
[01:50:06.262 --> 01:50:08.524]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:50:09.044 --> 01:50:11.466]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.208 --> 01:50:19.554]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.555 --> 01:50:27.538]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.019 --> 01:50:31.521]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.881 --> 01:50:34.403]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.443 --> 01:50:35.424]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.444 --> 01:50:36.324]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.344 --> 01:50:37.465]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.685 --> 01:50:38.426]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.666 --> 01:50:39.526]  That's what they're after.
[01:50:39.807 --> 01:50:44.370]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:50:51.334 --> 01:50:52.335]  You have been warned.
[01:50:53.476 --> 01:50:58.701]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.861 --> 01:51:06.950]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:14.257]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.377 --> 01:51:15.357]  We're good to go!

[01:51:51.249 --> 01:51:56.093]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:51:56.253 --> 01:52:01.457]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:52:01.798 --> 01:52:07.062]  Even a fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:52:07.482 --> 01:52:08.583]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:08.963 --> 01:52:18.026]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:52:18.287 --> 01:52:19.887]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:52:33.192 --> 01:52:33.952]  Keep it natural.
[01:52:34.273 --> 01:52:42.436]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.

[01:52:58.043 --> 01:53:01.905]  We're scheduled to have the owner of the Guns Show promoter
[01:53:03.573 --> 01:53:05.415]  The fellow that owns the gun shows coming on.
[01:53:06.095 --> 01:53:08.197]  He's supporting anti-gun Fred Thompson.
[01:53:08.217 --> 01:53:09.798]  We actually have his votes for you.
[01:53:10.479 --> 01:53:14.162]  You're not allowed to wear Ron Paul shirts in his gun shows.
[01:53:15.202 --> 01:53:17.104]  And no Ron Paul tables are allowed to be sold.
[01:53:17.885 --> 01:53:21.648]  Only Fred Thompson is allowed to weave his wicked magic dying of cancer.
[01:53:21.668 --> 01:53:26.071]  He's got very serious cancer that's normally terminal.
[01:53:26.151 --> 01:53:27.392]  I've been watching him give speeches.
[01:53:27.412 --> 01:53:28.193]  He can hardly talk.
[01:53:28.733 --> 01:53:30.775]  He'll only do two hours of campaigning every other day.
[01:53:31.641 --> 01:53:33.922]  I mean, the guy is literally not doing too well.
[01:53:33.942 --> 01:53:37.543]  They're running a corpse against Ron Paul.
[01:53:38.264 --> 01:53:42.765]  All part of their nasty tricks, and we'll talk to this Dodo who's doing this.
[01:53:42.785 --> 01:53:46.067]  We had a call about it Sunday, looked in the news, confirmed it was really going on.
[01:53:46.927 --> 01:53:52.229]  The guy's probably a well-meaning idiot, starstruck by his lordship.
[01:53:53.371 --> 01:53:55.051]  Uh, Fred Thompson, the actor.
[01:53:55.071 --> 01:53:56.912]  I'm not saying you're bad or you're an actor.
[01:53:56.932 --> 01:54:00.613]  I'm in a few movies myself, but I'm not an actor by profession that got into politics.
[01:54:00.653 --> 01:54:04.154]  I'm a radio talk show host that people call up and say, hey, you wanna be in pictures?
[01:54:05.634 --> 01:54:09.875]  But, uh... And by the way, I don't even pursue it.
[01:54:09.895 --> 01:54:14.176]  I can be in a bunch of movies, but, uh... I might pursue it, though.
[01:54:14.576 --> 01:54:16.677]  Beat the New World Order, which isn't gonna happen any time soon.
[01:54:16.697 --> 01:54:19.657]  I can play a fat Texas sheriff.
[01:54:19.697 --> 01:54:20.297]  How's that sound?
[01:54:20.398 --> 01:54:22.258]  Alright, enough of the humor, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:23.312 --> 01:54:34.881]  I wanted to tell you about Arthelin at 321relief.com or 877-327-0365 extension A126 for this offer for our listeners.
[01:54:35.561 --> 01:54:36.322]  I checked into it.
[01:54:36.382 --> 01:54:49.291]  It's just a cocktail of well-documented herbs that are anti-inflammatory and very good for arthritis and other inflammation type conditions.
[01:54:50.362 --> 01:55:00.586]  It's a new product for folks and I can't make medical claims about it but I want my listeners who are either suffering from arthritis or other joint problems to go to this website 321relief.com and do your own research.
[01:55:00.646 --> 01:55:09.830]  I want you to be inquisitive and go read about the clinical studies and you'll understand why this compilation of full spectrum herbs seems to be especially effective for anyone experiencing joint pain.
[01:55:11.251 --> 01:55:13.872]  It's not just your ordinary arthritis pill ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:13.892 --> 01:55:13.932]  877-327-0365
[01:55:18.471 --> 01:55:22.995]  Or 321relief.com, there's a big fat banner on Infowars.com as well.
[01:55:23.035 --> 01:55:32.624]  And then, there's another fine sponsor that I love, that I want everybody to call and get free catalogs from, or order a 2 month supply of food to test it out.
[01:55:32.664 --> 01:55:40.992]  It's Freeze-Dried, so it keeps its nutritional value, lasts more than 10 years in controlled conditions, 10 years in uncontrolled conditions like your garage or attic.
[01:55:41.710 --> 01:55:44.271]  And high quality, no MSG, no poisons.
[01:55:44.872 --> 01:55:46.052]  Almost all of it's organic.
[01:55:46.072 --> 01:55:49.714]  They can't certify it 100% because some of the bananas are from overseas.
[01:55:50.394 --> 01:55:51.474]  But it's high quality.
[01:55:51.494 --> 01:55:52.495]  800-409-5633.
[01:55:53.295 --> 01:56:00.919]  With the economy, the talk of war, all the crazy things that are happening, I've got a two-year supply of food for two people.
[01:56:00.939 --> 01:56:01.499]  That's not enough.
[01:56:01.519 --> 01:56:02.119]  I'm going to get more.
[01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:04.660]  Everybody needs some storable food.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:05.681]  It stores very easily.
[01:56:05.701 --> 01:56:05.741]  800-409-5633.
[01:56:08.917 --> 01:56:09.458]  We're good to go.
[01:56:22.333 --> 01:56:32.682]  Scotch or a tie they're not going to wear, or a fruitcake that's going to give them indigestion, or fighting the mall crowds, frothing and grabbing and snatching for Chinese slave goods that'll break before you open them.
[01:56:33.202 --> 01:56:39.348]  Why not get high-quality DVDs, films, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Loose Change Final Cut.
[01:56:39.388 --> 01:56:40.368]  We have back in stock.
[01:56:40.428 --> 01:56:41.169]  Nobody's got it.
[01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:45.573]  Daniel Esselstyn's New Bilderberg book with over 100 plus photos and documents.
[01:56:45.633 --> 01:56:46.694]  More than that, it's ridiculous.
[01:56:47.561 --> 01:56:48.022]  We've got it!
[01:56:48.322 --> 01:56:54.026]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:56:54.627 --> 01:56:55.568]  Give the gift of truth.
[01:56:55.608 --> 01:56:57.169]  Give the gift of the Infowar.
[01:56:57.389 --> 01:56:58.390]  Use the grassroots power.
[01:56:58.650 --> 01:57:00.371]  With my films, you're authorized to make copies.
[01:57:01.052 --> 01:57:08.778]  And, just in the month of December, we have five months free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:08.998 --> 01:57:10.480]  Go check out the offer.
[01:57:10.580 --> 01:57:11.420]  Five months free.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:13.242]  Super high quality video downloads.
[01:57:14.404 --> 01:57:15.785]  Super high quality video streams.
[01:57:15.925 --> 01:57:17.667]  Watch the test clips that are there for you.
[01:57:18.788 --> 01:57:19.548]  Burn them to disk.
[01:57:19.689 --> 01:57:21.170]  A factory of fulcrum.
[01:57:21.310 --> 01:57:23.692]  An armory of resistance.
[01:57:24.432 --> 01:57:27.035]  I mean, this is a box of hand grenades in the Info War.
[01:57:27.335 --> 01:57:28.776]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:57:28.876 --> 01:57:29.717]  Five months free.
[01:57:30.197 --> 01:57:31.118]  Check out the offer.
[01:57:31.138 --> 01:57:31.819]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:32.719 --> 01:57:37.483]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:38.124 --> 01:57:39.205]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:50.285 --> 01:57:50.946]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.586 --> 01:57:52.667]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.347 --> 01:57:54.488]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.128 --> 01:57:55.929]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.690 --> 01:57:58.611]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.631 --> 01:58:01.933]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.434 --> 01:58:06.536]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:13.957 --> 01:58:30.511]  Well, for those that just joined us, Governor Rick Perry went to Bilderberg, right, and sold out Texas, and blocked the legislature that passed a law against him to not hand over 8,000 miles of existing roads, to have toll roads plopped on them by a foreign company, just because they filled as campaign coffers.
[01:58:30.812 --> 01:58:34.815]  They're going to use part of the money to fund the North American Union, that's all in the official government documents.
[01:58:35.916 --> 01:58:36.617]  It's all happening.
[01:58:37.738 --> 01:58:41.261]  Well, meanwhile, he's endorsed Rudolph Giuliani, son of the mob boss,
[01:58:42.165 --> 01:58:53.571]  And on top of that, if this doesn't get bad enough, Bracewell and Giuliani is a law firm out of Houston that Giuliani bought into and is the co-owner of.
[01:58:53.591 --> 01:59:01.674]  He entered into it three and a half years ago and Giuliani holds the briefs and is the lawyer of record, the attorney, the counselor of
[01:59:03.371 --> 01:59:05.932]  If this was a consular ship, where is the ambassador?
[01:59:06.352 --> 01:59:11.814]  I mean, he is an absolute New World Order front man, both of them, Giuliani and him.
[01:59:12.514 --> 01:59:14.275]  And we played it in the first hour.
[01:59:14.895 --> 01:59:24.078]  Up comes good old Rick Perry to go down to the Secretary of State's office and file the paperwork for Giuliani for President in Texas.
[01:59:24.498 --> 01:59:26.039]  I'm proud to do this for Giuliani.
[01:59:26.059 --> 01:59:29.260]  And then they start saying, oh, it looks like he's going to be the running mate.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.120]  He could be the running mate.
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:31.300]  Absolutely.
[01:59:31.320 --> 01:59:32.581]  That fits together like a
[01:59:33.692 --> 01:59:35.754]  Horse and carriage in more ways than one.
[01:59:36.355 --> 01:59:40.338]  I mean, that is, he's from the South, from the West, from Texas.
[01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:44.883]  Normally if a New Yorker is running or somebody from the East, that's what they do.
[01:59:44.903 --> 01:59:46.604]  I mean, what did Kennedy do?
[01:59:47.405 --> 01:59:50.187]  Kennedy was, of course, from Massachusetts.
[01:59:50.928 --> 01:59:51.849]  Slash New York.
[01:59:52.089 --> 01:59:52.770]  Slash Maine.
[01:59:53.427 --> 01:59:53.767]  I don't think so.
[02:00:13.132 --> 02:00:14.773]  Perry went to Bilderberg this year.
[02:00:15.053 --> 02:00:16.354]  Why did he go to Bilderberg this year?
[02:00:16.394 --> 02:00:26.940]  Because once the big Bilderberg group members are the owners of Sentra and the owners of the big banks financing this giant takeover and the first big leg of one arm of the NAFTA superhighway grid.
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:28.121]  That's in all the official U.S.
[02:00:28.181 --> 02:00:35.165]  maps, TxDOT maps, Canadian Parliament maps, Canadian state maps, and the media says it doesn't exist.
[02:00:35.706 --> 02:00:43.190]  The media says Bilderberg doesn't exist, NAU doesn't exist, SPP doesn't exist, Trans-Texas Corridor doesn't exist.
[02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:47.252]  They insult you every single day.
[02:00:48.332 --> 02:01:03.600]  They talk to you like you're idiots, but they talk real sweet to you and have the cute info babe, smiling with her lipstick on just right, with those eyes like she loves you, but she's looking at a teleprompter, she's in a big sterile studio, it's staged,
[02:01:04.247 --> 02:01:05.168]  It's a scam.
[02:01:05.268 --> 02:01:06.108]  It's a fraud.
[02:01:06.409 --> 02:01:07.769]  They're taking you for a ride.
[02:01:08.530 --> 02:01:11.352]  Meanwhile, we have this creme de la creme.
[02:01:11.392 --> 02:01:13.753]  The cream of the cream.
[02:01:14.114 --> 02:01:16.235]  I mean, Ron Paul would have been a Founding Father material in 1776.
[02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:23.500]  He'd have been Andrew Jackson material in 1832.
[02:01:23.980 --> 02:01:26.942]  And he is Save America material in 2007.
[02:01:26.982 --> 02:01:26.942]  2008.
[02:01:27.042 --> 02:01:32.646]  You've never heard me excited about other candidates, have you?
[02:01:32.786 --> 02:01:32.886]  No.
[02:01:33.829 --> 02:01:41.173]  You never heard me frothing about something, because you can feel revolution, you can feel the energy, you can feel destiny, whether he wins or not.
[02:01:41.554 --> 02:01:48.077]  This is about letting the establishment know we know who they are, and we're coming for them, and we're never backing off of this republic.
[02:01:48.518 --> 02:01:51.259]  We are going to defend this republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:01:54.361 --> 02:01:55.922]  Here are some of the articles I have in front of me.
[02:01:55.962 --> 02:01:59.024]  Thompson gets access to Florida gun shows, Miami Herald,
[02:02:01.087 --> 02:02:10.112]  And it says Victor Bean of the Florida and the Southern Gun and Knife Shows has said that he has 11 shows left of the primaries and estimates that 11,000 people will see Thompson's signs.
[02:02:10.533 --> 02:02:14.095]  He's been given exclusive access to the gun shows.
[02:02:14.555 --> 02:02:20.539]  And so we'll talk to him about this and why he is supporting Fred Thompson for El Presidente.
[02:02:20.559 --> 02:02:23.000]  He's scheduled to join us on the other side.
[02:02:23.020 --> 02:02:26.242]  We appreciate him coming on the show today.
[02:02:28.052 --> 02:02:29.593]  And we're going to find out more about this.
[02:02:29.613 --> 02:02:30.834]  There's also a CNN story.
[02:02:31.134 --> 02:02:32.935]  Thompson visits Florida Gun Show.
[02:02:33.395 --> 02:02:36.257]  Now that dovetails with this as well.
[02:02:36.837 --> 02:02:39.479]  This is the one and only GCN Radio Network.

[02:02:46.423 --> 02:02:47.844]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:48.904 --> 02:02:49.945]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.665 --> 02:02:54.848]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power.
[02:02:56.172 --> 02:03:03.597]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.337 --> 02:03:11.681]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.687 --> 02:03:19.670]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:03:26.575 --> 02:03:27.736]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.756 --> 02:03:28.516]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.536 --> 02:03:29.577]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.817 --> 02:03:30.578]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.778 --> 02:03:31.819]  That's what I have to lose here.

[02:05:45.816 --> 02:05:50.881]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:51.221 --> 02:05:53.503]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.972 --> 02:06:03.601]  Well, Fred Thompson's traveling around the country visiting gun shows.
[02:06:03.621 --> 02:06:04.602]  He's getting a lot of attention.
[02:06:05.162 --> 02:06:08.606]  Headline, Thompson visits Florida Gun Show.
[02:06:08.626 --> 02:06:09.227]  Here's another one.
[02:06:09.547 --> 02:06:15.334]  Thompson gets access to Florida Gun Shows, Tennessee Gun Shows, all over.
[02:06:16.933 --> 02:06:19.015]  And we had some listeners call in about this.
[02:06:19.236 --> 02:06:22.779]  They were asking questions about, exclusively, why is it Fred Thompson?
[02:06:22.819 --> 02:06:31.087]  So I thought we would just get the individual who's been in most of the press reports, Victor Bean, who is the owner of Southern Classic Gun and Knife Shows.
[02:06:31.528 --> 02:06:34.831]  FloridaGunShows.com is the website.
[02:06:35.392 --> 02:06:37.234]  And Mr. Bean, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:06:37.934 --> 02:06:38.375]  Thank you, sir.
[02:06:39.592 --> 02:06:47.555]  So how did you get hooked up with Fred Thompson, and why does it seem like, not just your gun show, but other gun shows, that he's the main guy really pushing in the gun shows?
[02:06:47.615 --> 02:06:52.477]  And some places it says that he's the exclusive candidate, quote, even allowed to be in the gun show.
[02:06:53.517 --> 02:07:02.340]  Well, Fred Thompson's the only candidate I'm aware of that's ever actually visited a gun show, and I think he's visited like five shows in like three or four different states.
[02:07:03.332 --> 02:07:06.273]  Uh, he's also, he has a very good record on voting for Second Amendment rights.
[02:07:06.353 --> 02:07:10.254]  It's like, I had a seat at the Republican, uh, debate in St.
[02:07:10.335 --> 02:07:21.999]  Petersburg, and, uh, when he was asked a question about, did he own a gun, he said he has two, and he's not going to tell you why he carries them, and that, uh, he believes that the Second Amendment means what it says.
[02:07:23.139 --> 02:07:29.041]  And a lot of people have gotten on board with him, because we, uh, you know exactly where Fred stands on whatever issue you're talking about.
[02:07:29.611 --> 02:07:31.833]  Well, sir, that's fine.
[02:07:31.893 --> 02:07:32.553]  It's your right.
[02:07:32.613 --> 02:07:33.774]  It's your private property.
[02:07:34.495 --> 02:07:36.536]  It's your right to have who you want in there.
[02:07:37.577 --> 02:07:46.203]  But the news reports I've gotten and what I've heard from listeners is specifically just Fred Thompson is allowed, though, to have campaign tables in your gun show, correct?
[02:07:46.884 --> 02:07:47.884]  No, that is not correct.
[02:07:48.144 --> 02:07:50.326]  I allow any candidate to come into the show.
[02:07:50.346 --> 02:07:58.392]  As a matter of fact, Ron Paul has been the most representative of the presidential candidates at my shows.
[02:07:59.535 --> 02:08:01.756]  Not Fred Thompson.
[02:08:01.796 --> 02:08:06.699]  I don't even know how many, but it's been a lot more than Fred Thompson.
[02:08:06.719 --> 02:08:10.781]  The rest of them have not contacted me at all, but certainly all of them are welcome to come to the show.
[02:08:12.350 --> 02:08:28.294]  Well, I've got a bunch of emails about other gun shows in Tennessee and other places where a Nashville meet-up group tried to go to one and a fellow named Bob Hope, no relation to the famous Bob Hope, told them they couldn't have one there.
[02:08:28.314 --> 02:08:30.074]  Now, that's just an email, that's just a report.
[02:08:30.734 --> 02:08:36.255]  I specifically got calls on air about your gun show in Tallahassee.
[02:08:36.316 --> 02:08:38.296]  I mean, didn't you just have one in Tallahassee?
[02:08:38.982 --> 02:08:39.503]  Yes, I did.
[02:08:39.563 --> 02:08:42.265]  I think the promoter you're talking about, his actual name is Bob Pope.
[02:08:42.766 --> 02:08:44.568]  And I'm not familiar with the situation up there.
[02:08:44.588 --> 02:08:49.613]  But yeah, there's a lot of misinformation going around right now, especially with the Ron Paul group.
[02:08:50.313 --> 02:08:54.574]  Well, let me bring Tom Roberts up, because he's a fellow that called me, called into the show.
[02:08:54.914 --> 02:08:58.615]  He's a person that says he was there, and says he was kept from even wearing a Ron Paul shirt.
[02:08:58.936 --> 02:09:05.538]  And then I want to actually talk with you, sir, about where the Second Amendment's going from here, and how we can, you know, all help each other support it.
[02:09:05.798 --> 02:09:11.419]  Tom Roberts, did you just hear Mr. Bean say that Ron Paul people aren't being kept out?
[02:09:12.039 --> 02:09:12.600]  Oh, I can't.
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:13.600]  No, that's not what I said.
[02:09:15.143 --> 02:09:16.404]  No, Ron Paul's fine.
[02:09:16.565 --> 02:09:17.526]  Well, all of them are fine.
[02:09:17.566 --> 02:09:20.028]  Ron Paul's been represented the most of anybody.
[02:09:20.609 --> 02:09:23.452]  But Ron Paul people are no longer accepted.
[02:09:23.472 --> 02:09:24.874]  But Ron Paul's welcome to come.
[02:09:25.855 --> 02:09:26.976]  Oh, now I understand.
[02:09:27.016 --> 02:09:30.139]  I thought you just said that Ron Paul tables are fine.
[02:09:30.179 --> 02:09:32.422]  Now you're saying Ron Paul people aren't, but Ron Paul is.
[02:09:32.958 --> 02:09:37.282]  The most representative presidential candidate I've ever had at the show has been Ron Paul.
[02:09:37.702 --> 02:09:38.903]  But I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
[02:09:38.963 --> 02:09:43.828]  Here is Tom Roberts who says that... Tom was... Yes, I know who he is.
[02:09:43.968 --> 02:09:45.970]  He came to the Tallahassee Show and I wouldn't allow him in.
[02:09:47.271 --> 02:09:50.614]  Okay, but I thought you said... Okay, well maybe I'm not hearing properly.
[02:09:50.814 --> 02:09:52.035]  Tom, what happened to you?
[02:09:53.096 --> 02:10:00.062]  Well, he just admitted that when I came to the show Saturday with my Ron Paul t-shirt that he refused to let me in and refused to provide an explanation.
[02:10:00.922 --> 02:10:06.838]  And it not only happened to me, but there were several other Ron Paul supporters here who suffered equal treatment from him.
[02:10:07.438 --> 02:10:10.419]  Mr. Bean, I'm not trying to beat you up, but I'm trying to understand.
[02:10:10.799 --> 02:10:14.579]  Ron Paul has a perfect gun voting record.
[02:10:14.639 --> 02:10:30.062]  The NRA, who's supporting new gun bills right now, by the way, actually tried to manipulate and had to retract in Texas because he said no to a gun bill that would actually give more control to the federal government, and then they claimed that was a pro-gun bill.
[02:10:30.382 --> 02:10:36.663]  Ron Paul properly said that it was an anti-gun bill, and I've got CNN right here quoting Gun Owners of America
[02:10:38.044 --> 02:10:46.991]  Well, here's what I think about Ron Paul.
[02:10:47.031 --> 02:10:50.354]  Now, I lived in Texas for 18 years in Ron Paul's district.
[02:10:50.414 --> 02:10:52.255]  I've known him a long time, or who he is.
[02:10:53.777 --> 02:10:55.238]  I think Ron Paul's a good man.
[02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:00.042]  I think he believes in the Constitution, means what it says.
[02:11:00.663 --> 02:11:03.085]  And everything he says, I think he's really saying it.
[02:11:03.125 --> 02:11:04.546]  He's not wishy-washy.
[02:11:04.966 --> 02:11:08.988]  He doesn't say one thing to one group until another group on the opposing side says something else.
[02:11:09.909 --> 02:11:18.554]  I think you know exactly where he stands, and that's something that very few politicians possess, is that quality to say it up front and know where they stand without being so wishy-washy.
[02:11:18.574 --> 02:11:19.435]  Well, I agree with you, sir.
[02:11:20.265 --> 02:11:25.007]  He also believes strongly in the Second Amendment, which I do also.
[02:11:25.067 --> 02:11:29.048]  I think our very country depends on the Second Amendment, just like my business does.
[02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:40.933]  So this question that a lot of people like Tom Roberts, or some of them have either been either lying or they've been duped by their own people about coming to the show.
[02:11:41.013 --> 02:11:48.196]  Explain to me why then you kept Tom Roberts, who's on the line right now, from coming to your show and trying to buy a ticket with a Ron Paul shirt?
[02:11:49.216 --> 02:11:56.004]  Okay, like I said, he's been represented at my show from any other president's candidate out there right now.
[02:11:56.705 --> 02:12:01.570]  And they came to six shows, and I gave them three tables to set up at the show.
[02:12:02.912 --> 02:12:06.135]  And during those six shows, they were problems at every one of them.
[02:12:06.576 --> 02:12:09.159]  And they were problems by being
[02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:14.882]  Disruptive to other exhibitors and patrons that come in the show who didn't share the same belief.
[02:12:14.942 --> 02:12:22.566]  And when they didn't share the same belief, they would verbally abuse them and say stuff like, you're the reason why this country's going to hell.
[02:12:24.047 --> 02:12:31.270]  Also, my show rules are all businesses conducted behind the tables, which I give to them for free.
[02:12:32.111 --> 02:12:33.051]  They didn't do that.
[02:12:33.131 --> 02:12:36.933]  What they did instead was pass out brochures at my front door blocking the door.
[02:12:37.733 --> 02:12:39.114]  They'd also corner people
[02:12:39.981 --> 02:12:43.925]  Uh, you know, talking about their little political pitch.
[02:12:43.985 --> 02:12:46.147]  And, you know, if they didn't agree, they got into it with them.
[02:12:46.627 --> 02:12:50.410]  They also went down the aisles of the show, screaming out, vote Ron Paul.
[02:12:50.570 --> 02:12:52.492]  And I'd have to find out who would do it.
[02:12:53.733 --> 02:12:57.737]  And one of two things happened whenever I'd confront them about their actions.
[02:12:58.357 --> 02:12:59.718]  And they would say, okay.
[02:13:00.019 --> 02:13:02.201]  And as soon as I turned my back, they'd go right back to doing it.
[02:13:02.921 --> 02:13:04.683]  Or they got belligerent with me.
[02:13:07.020 --> 02:13:08.781]  Let me just say this.
[02:13:08.801 --> 02:13:10.041]  You sound like a reasonable man.
[02:13:10.081 --> 02:13:11.362]  We wanted to get to the bottom of this.
[02:13:11.802 --> 02:13:12.642]  We wanted to find out.
[02:13:12.982 --> 02:13:17.184]  So you haven't done any deal with Thompson to make him exclusive?
[02:13:17.864 --> 02:13:18.824]  He's not exclusive.
[02:13:18.864 --> 02:13:20.705]  Somebody told me that was in the paper.
[02:13:21.045 --> 02:13:22.425]  But he's welcome to all shows.
[02:13:22.485 --> 02:13:23.526]  And so is any candidate.
[02:13:24.046 --> 02:13:27.687]  And Ron Paul is welcome to come to the show as well.
[02:13:27.707 --> 02:13:28.627]  You sound reasonable.
[02:13:29.027 --> 02:13:30.348]  So does Tom Roberts.
[02:13:30.408 --> 02:13:31.528]  I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.
[02:13:31.828 --> 02:13:33.969]  Tom, what's your side?
[02:13:35.137 --> 02:13:46.987]  Well, I had a table at the September Gun Show here in Tallahassee, and I rented for Ron Paul, and Mr. Bean was the president at that one, and we didn't have any such trouble as he described.
[02:13:47.347 --> 02:13:50.170]  That may have happened at other gun shows that he operated in Florida.
[02:13:50.666 --> 02:13:54.649]  But it did happen here, and so that's the only criteria that I go by.
[02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:56.110]  Let me just say this, let me just say this.
[02:13:56.270 --> 02:14:01.194]  I have no doubt that Ron Paul supporters aren't the most enthusiastic out there, and that's to be expected.
[02:14:01.214 --> 02:14:08.120]  I can understand, though, how, because I've had tables at gun shows, they don't like you out in the halls and, you know, out in the aisles.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:15.846]  I can imagine there's probably other people, too, who like other Republicans, and they're probably hyping this up and complaining on Ron Paul.
[02:14:16.066 --> 02:14:17.427]  Did you ever think of that, Mr. Bean?
[02:14:17.447 --> 02:14:19.789]  All right, now say that again?
[02:14:20.385 --> 02:14:29.669]  You know, other people who've got tables, other Republicans who like other candidates, maybe they're exaggerating, maybe they're tattletailing on the Ron Paul supporters.
[02:14:31.230 --> 02:14:49.498]  I don't know, I don't know, but I know a lot of... I get asked a couple times a day at shows, you know, who Ron Paul is, and when I tell people, they'll say something like, I'll never vote for him, they don't even know who he is, and they say that because of the actions of his campaign workers.
[02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:55.202]  But they're not going to be coming into the show and disrupting the show and the patrons like that.
[02:14:55.682 --> 02:14:57.823]  Did you have trouble at the Tallahassee Show?
[02:14:58.743 --> 02:15:12.467]  I wasn't at the particular one before, but they did pass out literature outside, which they were told not to, and the person I had working for me, I told them there was going to be a competition, because I had competitions before, and I told them not to worry about it, that particular show.
[02:15:13.348 --> 02:15:15.708]  But yes, they did not stay behind their tables.
[02:15:15.728 --> 02:15:17.209]  They passed out literature out front.
[02:15:18.649 --> 02:15:20.150]  And Fred Thompson isn't doing that?
[02:15:21.490 --> 02:15:22.870]  No, they stay behind their tables.
[02:15:23.671 --> 02:15:26.371]  But I bet Fred Thompson caused a disturbance when he showed up.
[02:15:26.431 --> 02:15:31.953]  I mean, that's kind of fun to have stuff like that going on, but I guess... Tom, what do you think is going on here?
[02:15:32.613 --> 02:15:43.896]  Well, I know all the people that were working my table in September, and I'm not aware of anybody that was passing out literature in the aisles, anywhere except the table, or outside.
[02:15:44.494 --> 02:15:52.821]  And if there was any of that going on, being that my name was on the contract for the rental table, his assistant who was covering that show never brought it to my attention.
[02:15:52.861 --> 02:15:57.285]  So I find it highly dubious his claim that that happened is accurate.
[02:15:57.725 --> 02:16:06.253]  Mr. Bean, I wonder why several newspapers, I've got them here in the stack, reported that Thompson's been given exclusivity to not just your show, but other shows.
[02:16:07.354 --> 02:16:08.194]  I don't know.
[02:16:08.234 --> 02:16:09.035]  I couldn't tell you that.
[02:16:09.776 --> 02:16:10.076]  Alex?
[02:16:10.797 --> 02:16:10.977]  Yes.
[02:16:11.739 --> 02:16:15.561]  There was a Fred Thompson table at the gun show here this past weekend.
[02:16:17.122 --> 02:16:18.523]  But that's not exclusivity.
[02:16:18.563 --> 02:16:19.663]  Was anybody else allowed in?
[02:16:19.683 --> 02:16:22.765]  No other candidate tables.
[02:16:23.445 --> 02:16:23.645]  No.
[02:16:25.166 --> 02:16:27.247]  But nobody else asked other than the Ron Paul people?
[02:16:28.088 --> 02:16:28.408]  No one.
[02:16:28.548 --> 02:16:30.909]  Just Ron Paul and Fred Thompson is the only one that's ever asked.
[02:16:31.169 --> 02:16:33.851]  None of the other candidates have ever asked to be at the show at today's.
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:39.702]  Alright, well I've tried to get to the bottom of this, and I guess the listeners can just decide for themselves.
[02:16:40.043 --> 02:16:49.408]  Regardless, I think people need to buy more guns, so I hope they go to your gun show and buy guns, but I hope you'd be more lenient on the Ron Paul people and give them a second chance, Mr. Bean.
[02:16:49.428 --> 02:16:52.250]  Well, you know, I have given a second chance.
[02:16:52.290 --> 02:16:54.151]  I've given it actually 48 times now.
[02:16:54.671 --> 02:16:57.032]  But, you know, what I feel, you know, Ron Paul's a good guy.
[02:16:57.052 --> 02:16:59.734]  I know he's fighting what he believes in.
[02:17:00.534 --> 02:17:09.244]  And it's a shame that someone like Ron Paul is giving so much service to this country and dedication of his life is being disgraced by his own campaign workers.
[02:17:10.145 --> 02:17:14.149]  And I don't understand that and they're losing votes for him by acting the way they do at these shows.
[02:17:15.299 --> 02:17:26.862]  Well, regardless of what the truth is, it is good to, at least when you're inside facilities, to try to be as dignified as possible, because there's a lot of ninnying neocons guaranteed that are making a big deal out of small things.
[02:17:27.222 --> 02:17:30.923]  And then maybe by the time you get it, Mr. Bean, it's been distorted, but who knows?
[02:17:31.204 --> 02:17:32.544]  Mr. Bean, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:17:33.084 --> 02:17:33.764]  Thanks for having me.
[02:17:34.444 --> 02:17:36.585]  Okay, Tom Roberts, I cut you short.
[02:17:36.645 --> 02:17:37.005]  Stay there.
[02:17:37.025 --> 02:17:39.846]  I'm going to let you finish up on the other side.
[02:17:40.486 --> 02:17:42.547]  This is the GCN Radio Network, truthnews.us.
[02:17:47.723 --> 02:17:48.764]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:17:49.164 --> 02:17:54.648]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:17:55.228 --> 02:17:55.728]  That's right.
[02:17:56.049 --> 02:17:58.330]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:17:58.890 --> 02:18:05.795]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:18:06.374 --> 02:18:14.068]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:18:14.509 --> 02:18:19.317]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:18:19.984 --> 02:18:24.989]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:25.790 --> 02:18:29.934]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:18:30.295 --> 02:18:30.555]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:30.595 --> 02:18:32.497]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:18:32.577 --> 02:18:32.877]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:33.178 --> 02:18:33.438]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:49.922]  The holidays are here, and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[02:18:50.082 --> 02:18:52.643]  Why not make your New Year's resolution to eat healthier?
[02:18:52.823 --> 02:18:57.584]  And the easiest and most delicious way to start is with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.
[02:18:57.604 --> 02:19:01.786]  The Excalibur Dehydrator makes eating healthy not only easy, but fun.
[02:19:01.886 --> 02:19:05.227]  You can use it with your favorite fruit, vegetables, fish and meat.
[02:19:05.547 --> 02:19:11.210]  And the Excalibur Dehydrator cuts out the unnecessary salt, fat and preservatives found in most grocery store foods.
[02:19:11.450 --> 02:19:14.731]  You can also use the Excalibur Dehydrator to make your own herbs.
[02:19:15.191 --> 02:19:15.971]  We're good to go!
[02:19:46.696 --> 02:19:47.417]  Terrorism!
[02:19:47.437 --> 02:19:48.357]  Terrorism!
[02:19:48.477 --> 02:19:54.541]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:19:54.801 --> 02:19:56.383]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:19:56.643 --> 02:19:59.124]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:19:59.505 --> 02:20:14.074]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:14.114 --> 02:20:14.435]  government.
[02:20:14.615 --> 02:20:16.336]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:20:16.776 --> 02:20:22.681]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:22.821 --> 02:20:27.305]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[02:20:27.585 --> 02:20:33.010]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:34.291]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:34.351 --> 02:20:34.891]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:20:34.951 --> 02:20:37.013]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:20:46.187 --> 02:20:47.868]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[02:20:48.128 --> 02:20:49.808]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[02:20:50.008 --> 02:20:54.030]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:57.291]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[02:20:57.451 --> 02:21:01.293]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[02:21:01.433 --> 02:21:03.814]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[02:21:03.954 --> 02:21:07.195]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[02:21:07.295 --> 02:21:07.575]  I think so.
[02:21:23.012 --> 02:21:23.292]  I think so.
[02:21:48.641 --> 02:21:49.282]  We're good.
[02:22:23.311 --> 02:22:27.772]  You know, my good friend Jimmy Vaughn toured twice in the last year with Bob Dylan.
[02:22:27.812 --> 02:22:29.153]  I wish I could have gone to see that.
[02:22:30.493 --> 02:22:31.954]  He tours with him again next year.
[02:22:32.574 --> 02:22:35.054]  I'm gonna go to whatever city he's at and see it.
[02:22:35.074 --> 02:22:36.095]  I heard it's good.
[02:22:36.115 --> 02:22:39.896]  Democracy don't ruin the world.
[02:22:39.936 --> 02:22:42.897]  You better get that through your head.
[02:22:43.337 --> 02:22:45.417]  This world is ruled by violence.
[02:22:46.298 --> 02:22:48.358]  This world is ruled by violence.
[02:22:48.398 --> 02:22:50.239]  But I guess that's better now.
[02:22:53.124 --> 02:22:56.846]  Alright, I got a bunch of international news, bunch of economic news, tons of stuff.
[02:22:56.906 --> 02:23:02.448]  I'll even take some of your calls in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:23:02.488 --> 02:23:03.248]  Love to hear from you.
[02:23:03.809 --> 02:23:04.989]  Going back to Tom Roberts.
[02:23:05.489 --> 02:23:10.311]  Yeah, Mr. Bean sounded like somebody backpedaling, but I can't portend exactly what's going on.
[02:23:10.351 --> 02:23:12.332]  But he was saying, I don't ban any tables.
[02:23:12.392 --> 02:23:13.473]  I don't ban any people.
[02:23:14.053 --> 02:23:15.674]  I don't stop any of them from being in there.
[02:23:15.694 --> 02:23:18.655]  And I went, OK, well, we got Tom Roberts.
[02:23:18.675 --> 02:23:20.276]  He went, I mean, I did stop him.
[02:23:21.276 --> 02:23:23.719]  I did stop him, and they're not allowed now!
[02:23:23.739 --> 02:23:24.379]  They're bad!
[02:23:24.399 --> 02:23:25.500]  I don't have them!
[02:23:26.401 --> 02:23:35.949]  And then he went into a whole story about why he doesn't have them there, and Tom's saying that doesn't jive with the facts, and I'm not here to get in some squabbling fight with some gun shows.
[02:23:36.310 --> 02:23:38.472]  The point is, this is happening across the board.
[02:23:39.433 --> 02:23:45.258]  Ron Paul is being censored, manipulated, controlled, suppressed, demonized, lied about, spun,
[02:23:46.184 --> 02:23:48.185]  So we just gotta redouble our efforts even more.
[02:23:48.245 --> 02:23:50.046]  And yes, I'm pushing a lot of Ron Paul this week.
[02:23:50.086 --> 02:23:51.727]  The money bomb is Sunday!
[02:23:54.188 --> 02:23:56.229]  Sunday to stop sundown on the union.
[02:23:57.049 --> 02:23:59.050]  Tom, you got the floor in the last few minutes of this segment.
[02:23:59.210 --> 02:24:00.270]  Now, say what you need to say.
[02:24:00.791 --> 02:24:01.831]  Is he still on the line?
[02:24:02.592 --> 02:24:03.232]  No, he's gone.
[02:24:03.272 --> 02:24:03.572]  Go ahead.
[02:24:03.592 --> 02:24:03.912]  Okay.
[02:24:04.232 --> 02:24:14.257]  Well, he not only threw me out of the show, but from September until the first of December, when we tried repeatedly to book a table for the show,
[02:24:15.465 --> 02:24:22.609]  The common line that we got from his office was that we're only selling political tables for Fred Thompson.
[02:24:22.909 --> 02:24:24.110]  We're not taking any others.
[02:24:24.870 --> 02:24:27.251]  But, you know, I don't believe you.
[02:24:27.291 --> 02:24:28.172]  They didn't say that.
[02:24:28.272 --> 02:24:29.312]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:24:29.412 --> 02:24:30.793]  And the papers don't say that either.
[02:24:31.553 --> 02:24:34.714]  Well, we didn't have a table because... No, I'm being sarcastic.
[02:24:34.774 --> 02:24:37.154]  I mean, yeah, it's not looking too good for Mr. Bean.
[02:24:37.454 --> 02:24:41.255]  Why do you think now he... We would have had a table if they would have rented us one, and we didn't.
[02:24:41.475 --> 02:24:43.196]  No, I understand.
[02:24:43.256 --> 02:24:45.977]  So why now is he backpedaling?
[02:24:46.957 --> 02:24:52.378]  Well, because he's been caught with his hand in... You know, he's been caught now and he's trying to save it.
[02:24:52.898 --> 02:24:54.979]  Like I said, it's a PR disaster for him.
[02:24:55.339 --> 02:24:59.760]  Did you hear him saying Fred Thompson is good when he's got a bad gun record?
[02:25:00.447 --> 02:25:07.328]  Well, there's more to the Constitution than the Second Amendment, and he's equally amiss and deficient on the Constitution across the board.
[02:25:07.809 --> 02:25:12.250]  And I emailed him an article, you know, Fred Thompson, the fake conservative.
[02:25:13.390 --> 02:25:14.290]  So what are there?
[02:25:14.330 --> 02:25:16.630]  I mean, you've been at a bunch of these.
[02:25:16.811 --> 02:25:21.852]  Is my guess correct that there's lots of other little neocons that also tattle on you and stomp around?
[02:25:22.652 --> 02:25:27.713]  Well, I mean, we had people come to the table in September who were, you know, for other candidates.
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:30.780]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[02:25:31.281 --> 02:25:32.061]  That's what I thought.
[02:25:32.081 --> 02:25:34.623]  You're just not allowed to talk back to the Giuliani supporters.
[02:25:34.843 --> 02:25:49.194]  One of the first people that we had come up to us on the early Saturday morning back in September said, oh, well, Ron Paul's an idiot and I'm supporting so-and-so, you know, and we just said, all right, very good, well, you know, we'll just have to agree to disagree, you know, and he moved on and that was the end of it.
[02:25:49.795 --> 02:25:58.762]  We didn't get into any debate or terrain like he was saying, and I'm not disputing that that might have happened at other shows, but I can only address what happened here and none of that happened.
[02:26:00.202 --> 02:26:07.946]  You know, and all I'm going to say is that Mr. Bean, to all the gun owners in Florida, regardless of who they support, Mr. Bean is shooting himself in the foot.
[02:26:08.466 --> 02:26:25.935]  You know, it's not going to go well with him and his business, henceforth, because I'm going to contact the Meetup group in every town that he does his gun shows, and many of those Ron Paul supporters are gun supporters, too.
[02:26:26.727 --> 02:26:32.352]  Well, I've got to do more research.
[02:26:32.392 --> 02:26:37.156]  I've got the articles here that mention other gun shows and him supposedly gave exclusions.
[02:26:37.236 --> 02:26:38.837]  In Florida or elsewhere?
[02:26:39.578 --> 02:26:45.863]  It says Tennessee, with other people it says Florida, but it doesn't really give a source, so we don't know that's true.
[02:26:46.163 --> 02:26:47.944]  But it sure looks like he's acting like that.
[02:26:48.124 --> 02:26:52.368]  Well, the fact that he refused to sell us a table, or rent us a table for this show,
[02:26:53.510 --> 02:26:53.851]  I don't know.
[02:27:13.171 --> 02:27:15.593]  You also said that he was real mean to you this weekend, right?
[02:27:15.933 --> 02:27:17.914]  Well, yeah, he was very hostile and rough.
[02:27:17.994 --> 02:27:24.038]  All he kept telling was that I wasn't listening, and that he wasn't going to repeat himself, and I needed to leave, and he wasn't going to tell me why.
[02:27:25.239 --> 02:27:26.280]  Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:28.121]  Let's just redouble our efforts, okay, Tom?
[02:27:28.721 --> 02:27:29.181]  Fair enough.
[02:27:29.302 --> 02:27:30.162]  You called me Sunday.
[02:27:30.202 --> 02:27:31.623]  I told you I'd get to the bottom of it.
[02:27:31.663 --> 02:27:32.123]  We tried.
[02:27:32.524 --> 02:27:33.084]  I believe you.
[02:27:33.104 --> 02:27:33.724]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.166 --> 02:27:37.087]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.547 --> 02:27:39.048]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.055 --> 02:27:42.877]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:27:49.442 --> 02:27:52.964]  Stealth cameras cleverly disguised as items commonly found around the home.
[02:27:53.064 --> 02:27:58.028]  Night vision cameras, covert phone and voice recorders, powerful binoculars, security systems and more.
[02:27:58.108 --> 02:28:01.931]  Find hidden cameras wherever you go with a small handheld spy finder.
[02:28:02.031 --> 02:28:04.753]  And locate hidden transmitters with one of our bug detectors.
[02:28:04.853 --> 02:28:07.995]  Spyville.com also carries a wide variety of night vision scopes.
[02:28:08.015 --> 02:28:08.595]  I don't think so.
[02:28:27.731 --> 02:28:29.212]  Christmas is coming so don't delay.
[02:28:29.272 --> 02:28:30.692]  Go to Spyville.com.
[02:28:30.732 --> 02:28:33.853]  That is S-P-Y-V-I-L-L-E dot com.
[02:28:33.933 --> 02:28:34.754]  Or call us today at 866-779-8455.
[02:28:34.794 --> 02:28:34.974]  That's 866-779-8455.
[02:28:34.994 --> 02:28:35.334]  Spyville dot com.
[02:28:35.394 --> 02:28:37.055]  Where your personal security and well-being is our goal.
[02:28:46.218 --> 02:28:48.060]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:48.200 --> 02:28:53.383]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:28:53.544 --> 02:28:54.905]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:28:55.165 --> 02:29:03.331]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:03.551 --> 02:29:09.155]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:29:09.455 --> 02:29:11.236]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:29:11.296 --> 02:29:13.456]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:13.476 --> 02:29:17.857]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:18.017 --> 02:29:20.158]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:29:20.218 --> 02:29:27.980]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:28.400]  We're good.
[02:29:45.658 --> 02:29:46.299]  It's a fact.
[02:29:46.519 --> 02:29:54.005]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:29:54.125 --> 02:30:02.993]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:30:03.273 --> 02:30:13.802]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:30:14.062 --> 02:30:20.126]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:30:20.346 --> 02:30:25.350]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:30:25.550 --> 02:30:30.033]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:30:30.193 --> 02:30:31.994]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:30:32.014 --> 02:30:32.235]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:30:32.275 --> 02:30:32.735]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:30:32.855 --> 02:30:34.676]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:30:41.981 --> 02:30:44.942]  In constant sorrow through his days I
[02:31:09.049 --> 02:31:19.957]  And the man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my days I'm a bit fairway
[02:31:24.620 --> 02:31:26.503]  Monday through Friday, my friends!
[02:31:41.003 --> 02:31:41.663]  From 11 a.m.
[02:31:41.703 --> 02:31:42.704]  until 2 p.m.
[02:31:43.384 --> 02:31:44.825]  Central Standard Time.
[02:31:44.905 --> 02:31:47.406]  We're here live at Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:31:48.326 --> 02:31:59.030]  But then we restream on the internet 21 hours a day at InfoWars.com and TruthNews.us until the next live show starts up at 11 a.m.
[02:31:59.070 --> 02:32:02.091]  Central, 12 noon Eastern, 10 a.m.
[02:32:02.931 --> 02:32:04.212]  Mountain, 9 a.m.
[02:32:04.252 --> 02:32:04.712]  Pacific.
[02:32:06.745 --> 02:32:07.186]  9 a.m.
[02:32:07.206 --> 02:32:08.327]  to noon at Pacific.
[02:32:08.347 --> 02:32:09.908]  We're live each and every day.
[02:32:09.948 --> 02:32:12.330]  Don't forget the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:12.611 --> 02:32:14.032]  It's your MP3 or iPod device.
[02:32:14.312 --> 02:32:16.874]  Listen how you want, where you want, anytime you want.
[02:32:17.535 --> 02:32:21.338]  And I know you know about it, regular listeners, but tell friends, neighbors, family.
[02:32:22.059 --> 02:32:23.620]  I don't have time to listen to that radio show.
[02:32:23.640 --> 02:32:24.061]  Tell them, hey!
[02:32:25.396 --> 02:32:26.257]  Give me your iPod.
[02:32:26.297 --> 02:32:27.137]  I'll load it up for you.
[02:32:27.157 --> 02:32:27.998]  It's on my computer.
[02:32:28.058 --> 02:32:28.338]  Boom!
[02:32:28.398 --> 02:32:29.419]  Here's three hours of it.
[02:32:29.819 --> 02:32:34.082]  Or you can go to prisonplanet.tv and download without subscribing just certain interviews.
[02:32:35.063 --> 02:32:35.763]  And get them hooked.
[02:32:35.883 --> 02:32:37.385]  That's how we get people to wake up.
[02:32:37.425 --> 02:32:40.187]  It's how we spread the message of liberty and freedom.
[02:32:41.067 --> 02:32:49.533]  Alright, I know we've got Billy, Mike, Skip, Dan, and maybe one or two others will have time to take your calls on a few of the stories I want to hit on.
[02:32:49.953 --> 02:32:52.135]  Virus starts like a cold but can be a killer.
[02:32:52.335 --> 02:32:53.116]  MSNBC.
[02:32:53.936 --> 02:32:54.697]  And it goes after
[02:32:56.235 --> 02:32:57.035]  The healthiest people.
[02:32:58.056 --> 02:33:03.878]  Also, 9-11 Victims, Lawyers, Blast Ground Zero, Toxic Air, Lies in Court.
[02:33:03.898 --> 02:33:06.960]  I've got a few other things that are very important.
[02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:09.601]  Oh yeah, I've got a CIA Interrogator clip I've got to play.
[02:33:10.081 --> 02:33:11.201]  So I've got to move fast.
[02:33:11.382 --> 02:33:14.543]  Before we do that, it's Christmas.
[02:33:15.263 --> 02:33:21.706]  And one of the best gifts I can think of this holiday season is I say I give people videos, water filters, things like that.
[02:33:23.482 --> 02:33:26.284]  Well, something else is getting them off of detergents.
[02:33:26.324 --> 02:33:30.168]  The big chemical companies after World War II bought up and took over the soap companies.
[02:33:30.628 --> 02:33:36.633]  They got rid of natural and healthy organic soaps and they replaced them with petrochemical byproducts.
[02:33:37.054 --> 02:33:39.196]  The average shampoo has hundreds of chemicals.
[02:33:39.276 --> 02:33:39.976]  They're all deadly.
[02:33:39.996 --> 02:33:40.817]  They're all poisonous.
[02:33:41.117 --> 02:33:41.918]  They're all horrible.
[02:33:42.759 --> 02:33:45.401]  I mean, one compound might have a hundred ingredients.
[02:33:45.461 --> 02:33:47.523]  I mean, some of them might have thousands of different compounds.
[02:33:48.183 --> 02:33:48.844]  It's insane.
[02:33:49.742 --> 02:33:55.767]  And for about four years now, about four years time flies, I've been on Cal Ben Pure Soap before they were ever even a sponsor.
[02:33:56.548 --> 02:34:01.271]  The sales manager up at Genesis was just, he was an environmentalist Republican at the same time.
[02:34:01.672 --> 02:34:03.533]  And he was really into organic stuff.
[02:34:03.553 --> 02:34:05.515]  He said, man, I found this stuff institutions buy.
[02:34:05.935 --> 02:34:13.341]  I found this stuff that the nice hotels and that hospitals buy because they know how to save money and it's high quality.
[02:34:14.041 --> 02:34:15.963]  85% off supermarket prices.
[02:34:16.323 --> 02:34:18.745]  Why not get their sampler tote bag for Christmas?
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:21.942]  Call Cal Ben up, they'll ship it wherever you want it sent.
[02:34:22.962 --> 02:34:28.326]  To give them a sample of real organics and send them a card that says, hey, this is organic soap you just got.
[02:34:28.946 --> 02:34:34.409]  They can drop ship it out to where you want, send a card along and say, hey, that soap you got, that's organic and it's inexpensive.
[02:34:34.730 --> 02:34:38.812]  And turn your family on, your neighbors on.
[02:34:39.313 --> 02:34:42.394]  That's how we also hurt the New World Order and save money at the same time.
[02:34:43.095 --> 02:34:44.876]  See, I just basically promote what I live.
[02:34:45.076 --> 02:34:46.217]  I just promote what I'm into.
[02:34:46.997 --> 02:34:50.559]  It's real easy, and it's really easy sales pitch too, because I believe in it.
[02:34:51.059 --> 02:34:53.720]  And Marty's had the company now for 60 years, since 1947.
[02:34:54.621 --> 02:34:56.982]  Got back from World War II in the Chemical Corps.
[02:34:57.582 --> 02:35:01.424]  So he knew how bad the detergent subs were, and he started a soap company with his papa.
[02:35:01.984 --> 02:35:03.705]  And now he and his son run it today.
[02:35:04.425 --> 02:35:07.347]  And so it's also an American mom-and-pop company.
[02:35:07.907 --> 02:35:09.748]  And we're honored to have him up for a few minutes with us.
[02:35:09.788 --> 02:35:10.768]  Marty, thanks for coming on.
[02:35:11.129 --> 02:35:11.829]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:35:11.949 --> 02:35:14.150]  I think it's time for our pure soap jingle.
[02:35:15.010 --> 02:35:15.411]  Okay.
[02:35:15.931 --> 02:35:16.171]  Ready?
[02:35:17.185 --> 02:35:19.747]  Give me that all time pure soap!
[02:35:20.167 --> 02:35:22.408]  Give me that all time pure soap!
[02:35:22.849 --> 02:35:25.290]  Give me that all time pure soap!
[02:35:25.691 --> 02:35:26.931]  It's good enough for you!
[02:35:26.951 --> 02:35:29.113]  If it's good enough for Alex!
[02:35:29.653 --> 02:35:33.836]  If it's good enough for... If it's good enough for the USA!
[02:35:34.136 --> 02:35:35.377]  It's good enough for you!
[02:35:35.397 --> 02:35:36.538]  Hallelujah!
[02:35:36.558 --> 02:35:36.878]  1-800-340-7091!
[02:35:36.898 --> 02:35:38.719]  It's good enough for you!
[02:35:38.739 --> 02:35:40.040]  What have you got to clean?
[02:35:45.734 --> 02:35:50.397]  You know, Marty, what other CEO is so adorable and classic?
[02:35:50.797 --> 02:35:53.398]  You are a true treasure and such a character.
[02:35:53.418 --> 02:35:59.102]  You know, so many people from your generation, and I've had a chance to know, are just like you.
[02:35:59.122 --> 02:36:01.503]  I guess folks used to just be really cheerful.
[02:36:05.385 --> 02:36:06.726]  I mean, you are so cheerful, Marty.
[02:36:07.146 --> 02:36:08.627]  Well, I try to give the good news.
[02:36:08.988 --> 02:36:14.731]  The good news is satisfaction is guaranteed, or double your dirt bag.
[02:36:16.155 --> 02:36:21.544]  Hey, in a nutshell, tell them about some of your product lines, why they're so good, why they save 85% off supermarket prices.
[02:36:21.865 --> 02:36:26.152]  Well, we only make four basic, natural, pure soaps.
[02:36:26.732 --> 02:36:27.454]  Bath soap,
[02:36:28.126 --> 02:36:31.667]  Hair soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[02:36:32.007 --> 02:36:33.607]  They'll do 200 jobs.
[02:36:33.987 --> 02:36:46.230]  You eliminate the all-purpose cleaners, and the floor cleaners, and the pre-soaks, and the after-soaks, and the all-purposes, and all the chemicals, and solvents, and sprays, and liquids, and pills, and powders.
[02:36:46.551 --> 02:36:48.311]  Don't need them ever again.
[02:36:48.651 --> 02:36:51.352]  We've been doing this for six decades.
[02:36:51.772 --> 02:36:54.152]  We are the only company of its kind.
[02:36:54.452 --> 02:36:56.293]  We've outlasted everybody else.
[02:36:56.690 --> 02:36:57.251]  We're here.
[02:36:57.311 --> 02:36:58.632]  We're a family company.
[02:36:58.913 --> 02:37:02.037]  You can get a free catalog with a free phone call.
[02:37:02.397 --> 02:37:03.639]  And this is what we do.
[02:37:03.659 --> 02:37:05.140]  This is what we live with.
[02:37:05.461 --> 02:37:06.662]  This is what we love.
[02:37:07.063 --> 02:37:08.725]  And we love all the
[02:37:09.585 --> 02:37:16.286]  Alex Jones listeners, if we give them special priority on the shipping and on the pricing.
[02:37:16.366 --> 02:37:19.727]  Yeah, if folks order in the next few days, can they get it in time for Christmas?
[02:37:19.747 --> 02:37:25.708]  Yes, we get it right out today or tomorrow, and it'll travel within a week to any location.
[02:37:25.888 --> 02:37:28.989]  Give them the number, and tell them about the Tilt Bag, not just the free catalog.
[02:37:29.729 --> 02:37:33.570]  Well, the free catalogs, of course, we put in the mail, but they can call us at 1-800
[02:37:35.077 --> 02:37:36.102]  340-7091 or see us on the web.
[02:37:41.690 --> 02:37:54.398]  And we're there, right there on the uh... FiveStarsSoap.com or CalvinPureSoap.com and a big fat link on the right hand or left hand side of InfoWars.com and a giant banner on JonesReport.com.
[02:37:54.418 --> 02:38:05.144]  There's also a link on PrisonPlanet.com, but Five Star, just the number Five Star, dot FiveStarsSoap.com or CalvinPureSoap.com, but give them that number again, Marty.
[02:38:05.164 --> 02:38:05.204]  800-340-
[02:38:08.519 --> 02:38:11.503]  Tell them what comes in the tote bag.
[02:38:11.523 --> 02:38:12.344]  It's a perfect gift.
[02:38:26.102 --> 02:38:34.169]  It's got 18 ounces in a special jar with a little tiny scoop of our granulated laundry soap.
[02:38:34.529 --> 02:38:36.611]  I say soap, not detergent.
[02:38:36.951 --> 02:38:45.659]  It's got a 16 ounce dispenser bottle of our triple concentrated shampoo, which is cocoa butter,
[02:38:46.323 --> 02:38:47.103]  You're good to go!
[02:39:06.906 --> 02:39:07.407]  I think so.
[02:39:18.134 --> 02:39:21.215]  Well, that pad could be cut in half or quarters.
[02:39:21.755 --> 02:39:23.935]  Uh, the pad by itself is a dollar.
[02:39:24.116 --> 02:39:26.016]  No, but I mean, I mean, I mean, how much is the whole tote bag?
[02:39:26.036 --> 02:39:35.078]  The whole package, uh, there's no tax, plus United Parcel to your door, which we don't know what it is because it depends on your zip code, is $18.
[02:39:35.699 --> 02:39:38.619]  And that's including everything I just mentioned.
[02:39:38.659 --> 02:39:40.400]  Marty, give him the number again in a limerick.
[02:39:40.420 --> 02:39:40.480]  1-800-340-7091.
[02:39:45.765 --> 02:39:49.666]  The lyric for today is from the 16th century.
[02:39:49.686 --> 02:39:57.029]  The old Anarchist down with the Pope and all the crowned heads of Europe.
[02:39:57.909 --> 02:39:59.549]  Equal rights is our creed.
[02:40:00.149 --> 02:40:01.430]  What more do we need?
[02:40:02.010 --> 02:40:04.771]  Then somebody shouted, more soap!
[02:40:07.446 --> 02:40:08.287]  Marty, God bless you.
[02:40:08.307 --> 02:40:08.727]  Take care.
[02:40:08.747 --> 02:40:10.588]  Talk to you next year, Alex.
[02:40:10.748 --> 02:40:12.189]  Yeah, have a good Christmas, my friend.
[02:40:12.209 --> 02:40:13.489]  We have him on once a month.
[02:40:13.569 --> 02:40:14.330]  What a character.
[02:40:14.670 --> 02:40:15.630]  It is great so, folks.
[02:40:16.131 --> 02:40:17.191]  Okay, I gotta move quick.
[02:40:17.211 --> 02:40:19.753]  I got a bunch of news, and I want to at least get to four or five of your calls.
[02:40:20.273 --> 02:40:29.418]  Former CIA interrogator, we carried out torture because the White House told us to.
[02:40:30.278 --> 02:40:33.060]  This is all over the mainstream news, ABC News, New York Times.
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:34.160]  We told you this years ago.
[02:40:34.180 --> 02:40:36.742]  In an interview last night with ABC News, John
[02:40:37.859 --> 02:40:39.141]  We're good to go.
[02:40:59.091 --> 02:41:01.513]  I'm not equipped to answer that question, said Hartman.
[02:41:01.533 --> 02:41:03.034]  And this is Senator Lindsey Graham
[02:41:24.361 --> 02:41:33.667]  Republican South Carolina asking him this and getting disgusted that he wouldn't even answer the question and say Iranians aren't allowed to torture our airmen.
[02:41:33.907 --> 02:41:36.208]  See, torture isn't torture now when they do it to us either.
[02:41:36.309 --> 02:41:36.689]  Here it is.
[02:41:37.409 --> 02:41:41.212]  One of the issues facing this country is waterboarding.
[02:41:43.553 --> 02:41:46.995]  General Hartman, do you believe waterboarding violates the Geneva Convention?
[02:41:49.022 --> 02:41:55.347]  I was asked that earlier, Senator, and with regard to this entire issue, we start with the following premise.
[02:41:55.848 --> 02:41:57.629]  Torture is illegal in the United States.
[02:41:57.669 --> 02:41:59.390]  We have a downed airman in Iran.
[02:42:00.391 --> 02:42:11.680]  We get a report that the Iranian government is involved in the exercise of waterboarding that downed airman on the theory they want to know when the next military operation may occur.
[02:42:13.242 --> 02:42:14.563]  What would be the response of
[02:42:15.839 --> 02:42:20.461]  What should be the response of the uniformed legal community regarding the activity of the Iranian government?
[02:42:21.662 --> 02:42:24.923]  I'm not equipped to answer that question, Senator.
[02:42:24.963 --> 02:42:25.444]  You are.
[02:42:25.464 --> 02:42:29.886]  I will tell you the answer to the question that you asked in the beginning, Senator.
[02:42:30.766 --> 02:42:43.272]  You mean you're not equipped to give a legal opinion as to whether or not Iranian military waterboarding, secret security agents waterboarding down airmen is a violation of the Geneva Convention?
[02:42:44.436 --> 02:42:46.598]  I am not prepared to answer that question, Sandra.
[02:42:46.658 --> 02:42:47.018]  I am prepared.
[02:42:47.038 --> 02:42:47.778]  I ain't up for the question.
[02:42:49.420 --> 02:42:53.682]  Now, this was the JAG officer, the legal advisor over Guantanamo.
[02:42:56.384 --> 02:43:01.368]  We have the Army report about Abu Ghraib, where they're raping him with battery acid.
[02:43:01.468 --> 02:43:03.249]  I mean, you can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:43:04.229 --> 02:43:05.250]  Let's go to your calls.
[02:43:05.430 --> 02:43:06.531]  Billy in New Jersey.
[02:43:06.571 --> 02:43:07.812]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:43:08.973 --> 02:43:09.353]  Hello?
[02:43:09.673 --> 02:43:09.953]  Hi.
[02:43:10.654 --> 02:43:10.934]  Oh, hi, Alex.
[02:43:10.974 --> 02:43:11.754]  How have you been?
[02:43:11.774 --> 02:43:13.916]  I actually called in, like, early in the year.
[02:43:14.497 --> 02:43:19.479]  No, I'm not knocking folks from New Jersey, but just everything hellish you can imagine in news reports always comes out of there.
[02:43:43.755 --> 02:43:44.575]  No, I mean serious.
[02:43:44.735 --> 02:43:45.856]  Can I just read this off to you?
[02:43:46.376 --> 02:43:47.176]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:43:47.556 --> 02:43:47.817]  Okay.
[02:43:48.057 --> 02:43:54.999]  New Jersey has the highest amount of people getting vaccinated and highest number of autism in the country, and now wants to mandate preschoolers getting tons of vaccines.
[02:43:55.299 --> 02:43:59.481]  The government has millions and millions of tons of nerve gas and mustard gas all along the shore.
[02:43:59.821 --> 02:44:09.985]  New Jersey is also a famous site for chemtrails, not to mention the schools are a complete police state with armed guards and police swiping IDs and cameras everywhere, which all transmit to the police department.
[02:44:11.604 --> 02:44:12.544]  I mean, that alone.
[02:44:12.784 --> 02:44:14.345]  And that's only the tip of the iceberg.
[02:44:15.005 --> 02:44:15.685]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:15.745 --> 02:44:19.346]  I mean, did you hear about the doctor which killed hundreds of people in the name of eugenics here?
[02:44:19.707 --> 02:44:19.967]  Yes.
[02:44:20.607 --> 02:44:21.187]  You heard about that?
[02:44:21.207 --> 02:44:21.947]  Tell folks about it.
[02:44:22.888 --> 02:44:26.049]  Okay, there was a doctor, and well, actually, I have the article right here.
[02:44:26.069 --> 02:44:27.029]  Do you want me to send it to you?
[02:44:27.109 --> 02:44:28.069]  I actually have a lot of these articles.
[02:44:28.109 --> 02:44:28.609]  Go ahead.
[02:44:28.830 --> 02:44:30.710]  I remember hearing about it, but go ahead and read it.
[02:44:31.810 --> 02:44:37.832]  Okay, well, there were inmates, and it was also people, I believe, it was at a mental facility.
[02:44:38.012 --> 02:44:39.133]  Yeah, foster children, yeah.
[02:44:40.089 --> 02:44:46.257]  Yeah, a doctor killed like millions, not millions, hundreds of people who were jailed there in the name of eugenics.
[02:44:46.697 --> 02:44:48.299]  What's the headline on the story you got?
[02:44:48.339 --> 02:44:50.021]  I saw that a few months ago.
[02:44:50.041 --> 02:44:54.527]  The headline says, the story of the New Jersey doctor who helped kill prisoners at
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:56.741]  She came walled in and named Eugenics.
[02:44:56.861 --> 02:44:58.982]  It's actually pretty long and it has a lot of information on it.
[02:44:59.022 --> 02:44:59.762]  Send it to me.
[02:44:59.782 --> 02:45:01.163]  I mean, there's so many thousands of these.
[02:45:01.183 --> 02:45:07.146]  I remember coming across the Eugenics shops in the foster homes and in the facilities.
[02:45:07.546 --> 02:45:09.167]  I mean, a bunch of Texas prisons.
[02:45:09.207 --> 02:45:14.530]  Huntsville has done bioweapons tests that got the guards and the surrounding towns sick.
[02:45:15.487 --> 02:45:16.148]  Oh, definitely.
[02:45:16.168 --> 02:45:17.109]  And they just never stop.
[02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:18.911]  And that's admitted, too.
[02:45:19.291 --> 02:45:20.492]  It's come out in Texas papers.
[02:45:20.512 --> 02:45:21.694]  They just go, oh, we're the government.
[02:45:22.114 --> 02:45:23.535]  Yeah, let the guards die, too.
[02:45:26.129 --> 02:45:27.130]  Yeah, they did that too.
[02:45:27.430 --> 02:45:30.792]  And I mean, I'm a senior in high school right now, and the schools are terrible.
[02:45:30.832 --> 02:45:35.095]  I mean, mine isn't as advanced with the police state, but I mean, like others around here.
[02:45:35.135 --> 02:45:35.856]  I mean, it's terrible.
[02:45:35.916 --> 02:45:39.838]  I mean, that's why I'm suggesting you just, like, come here and just do a documentary on it.
[02:45:40.059 --> 02:45:41.039]  I got a good idea.
[02:45:41.079 --> 02:45:43.941]  Buy a camera, get a cheap editing program, and you ought to make a film.
[02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:45.522]  Anybody can do what I've done.
[02:45:45.902 --> 02:45:49.425]  It's you that's going to save this country, save this planet with God's guidance.
[02:45:49.505 --> 02:45:50.366]  Thank you for the call, Billy.
[02:45:50.606 --> 02:45:52.087]  Call back again tomorrow if you'd like.
[02:45:52.427 --> 02:45:53.488]  Got to cut you short here.
[02:45:53.888 --> 02:45:55.229]  Mike in Idaho, go ahead.
[02:45:56.718 --> 02:45:57.038]  Hello.
[02:45:57.198 --> 02:45:57.779]  Hello, Mike.
[02:45:57.839 --> 02:45:58.439]  Yes, I can.
[02:46:00.240 --> 02:46:04.463]  Alex, it's been three years since I've listened to you and I'm listening to you now.
[02:46:07.184 --> 02:46:12.187]  You told me 28 to 30 days out that 9-11, something was going to happen.
[02:46:13.568 --> 02:46:15.910]  And I remember that from a long time ago.
[02:46:16.630 --> 02:46:23.054]  What's going on now that you've got your ears, people getting your ear that have talked to you in the past that are credible?
[02:46:24.752 --> 02:46:26.233]  What's the timetable now?
[02:46:26.713 --> 02:46:29.676]  It wasn't hard for me to predict 9-11 attacks.
[02:46:29.716 --> 02:46:34.760]  The feds took the bomb, trained the driver, gave them the detonators, attacked the World Trade Center the first time.
[02:46:36.141 --> 02:46:44.948]  Presidents like inaugural bombings or terror attacks in their first year, prime ministers do it too, to get to pose as the savior and have a new wave of police state expansion.
[02:46:45.985 --> 02:46:52.410]  I saw all over television how they introduced Bin Laden in the 3-4 months before 9-11 as the boogeyman.
[02:46:52.450 --> 02:46:53.391]  He's going to get you.
[02:46:53.451 --> 02:46:54.452]  He's going to attack you.
[02:46:55.552 --> 02:46:58.114]  I saw the papers saying, we're going to get hit by terrorists.
[02:46:58.154 --> 02:46:59.596]  Give your rights up when it happens.
[02:47:00.116 --> 02:47:01.797]  I went on air on the radio and on TV.
[02:47:01.837 --> 02:47:03.679]  By the way, that whole TV show hasn't been uploaded.
[02:47:03.699 --> 02:47:04.259]  We ought to do that.
[02:47:04.719 --> 02:47:09.943]  And we ought to dig up, somebody's got it, the July 25, 2001 program where I did two hours on it.
[02:47:12.443 --> 02:47:16.547]  In fact, I just found the CD in the garage the other day, put it somewhere, and can't find it again.
[02:47:16.567 --> 02:47:17.608]  It drives me up the wall.
[02:47:17.628 --> 02:47:18.749]  Sounds like me.
[02:47:19.229 --> 02:47:20.971]  Yeah, well, it's just I'm wallowing in this stuff.
[02:47:20.991 --> 02:47:24.735]  Can you imagine the amount of media we generate every day, much less every year, much less in September?
[02:47:24.755 --> 02:47:25.655]  What's next?
[02:47:25.736 --> 02:47:27.077]  Well, I mean, here's the thing.
[02:47:27.457 --> 02:47:28.758]  I knew they were going to do it then.
[02:47:28.898 --> 02:47:30.200]  Other people noticed it as well.
[02:47:31.361 --> 02:47:34.584]  And so I put out one other warning saying we're in a prime zone.
[02:47:36.727 --> 02:47:38.708]  Late last year, I didn't say they were going to do it.
[02:47:38.748 --> 02:47:41.969]  I said if we got the word out, we could back them off, and I think we did.
[02:47:42.009 --> 02:47:54.053]  They would have guaranteed, already staged more terror attacks if we hadn't exposed government-sponsored terror and taken that tool, taken that mechanism, as I've been saying for 10 years, of government-sponsored terror and exposed it.
[02:47:54.553 --> 02:47:58.855]  Breaking that tool that they have developed, basically smashing it.
[02:47:59.806 --> 02:48:01.707]  So now I think they're so bad.
[02:48:02.168 --> 02:48:03.689]  I don't think they know what they're going to do.
[02:48:04.049 --> 02:48:06.050]  And they're still hyping terror.
[02:48:06.070 --> 02:48:07.351]  They're still hyping all these things.
[02:48:07.871 --> 02:48:09.392]  They are in a prime position to do it.
[02:48:09.452 --> 02:48:12.754]  I'm not saying I see all the same signs that make me sure of it.
[02:48:12.774 --> 02:48:16.596]  They were more confident in mid-2001.
[02:48:16.616 --> 02:48:19.298]  I don't know now exactly what they're going to do.
[02:48:19.618 --> 02:48:20.919]  Their back's against the wall.
[02:48:20.939 --> 02:48:22.099]  They're like cornered rats.
[02:48:23.080 --> 02:48:24.581]  I hope they'd be smart and back off.
[02:48:25.282 --> 02:48:30.426]  That's not been their tendency in the past, but it appears it may be happening with Iran now, so it's good news.
[02:48:31.026 --> 02:48:32.987]  But right now, it's not that clear.
[02:48:33.347 --> 02:48:33.848]  Anything else?
[02:48:35.789 --> 02:48:36.389]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:37.250 --> 02:48:39.091]  Thank you so much for the call, Mike.
[02:48:39.772 --> 02:48:41.613]  We'll talk to Dan in New Hampshire and others.
[02:48:41.653 --> 02:48:43.674]  Final statement straight ahead, and more news.
[02:48:43.694 --> 02:48:44.075]  Stay with us.
[02:49:01.225 --> 02:49:03.668]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.408 --> 02:49:11.735]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.747 --> 02:49:19.731]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.212 --> 02:49:23.675]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.055 --> 02:49:26.557]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.637 --> 02:49:27.778]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.798 --> 02:49:28.559]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.579 --> 02:49:29.660]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.860 --> 02:49:30.580]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.841 --> 02:49:31.861]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:50:46.969 --> 02:50:52.410]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[02:50:52.831 --> 02:50:57.552]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[02:50:57.952 --> 02:51:00.593]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[02:51:01.073 --> 02:51:04.494]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[02:51:05.254 --> 02:51:09.575]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[02:51:10.015 --> 02:51:13.216]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[02:51:13.816 --> 02:51:16.637]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[02:51:17.418 --> 02:51:19.220]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.

[02:51:23.584 --> 02:51:24.504]  Ask for George.
[02:51:47.077 --> 02:51:49.798]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.818 --> 02:51:53.719]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:52:00.161]  Rob, one of my video guys, out in the hall during the break, said, hey, check this out.
[02:52:01.301 --> 02:52:09.063]  I have seen the last month at least three Glenn Beck polls on his site, where he would be bashing Ron Paul, and is Ron Paul crazy?
[02:52:09.103 --> 02:52:10.143]  Are his people dangerous?
[02:52:11.024 --> 02:52:12.144]  You know, 85% no.
[02:52:12.724 --> 02:52:14.085]  Who are you voting for for president?
[02:52:14.105 --> 02:52:14.645]  74% Ron Paul.
[02:52:17.305 --> 02:52:25.751]  Glenn Beck has now done, for all of you to see, I'm going to do a little blurb on PrisonPlanet.com the next hour on this, this is big, just because this is catching them red-handed.
[02:52:25.811 --> 02:52:27.493]  It's not just some poll or some call.
[02:52:29.134 --> 02:52:31.556]  He lists all of the candidates.
[02:52:31.716 --> 02:52:34.398]  It says, who will win the 08 Republican nomination?
[02:52:34.438 --> 02:52:42.324]  Duncan Hunter, who isn't even hardly in the race now, Fred Thompson, Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, Tom Tancreda.
[02:52:43.365 --> 02:52:46.487]  This is at Glenn Beck's site.
[02:52:47.117 --> 02:52:47.797]  And CNN.
[02:52:49.458 --> 02:52:53.340]  And here's a previous poll he had on Glennbeck.com.
[02:52:54.341 --> 02:52:59.944]  It says, what percentage of you vote will receive Ron Paul in the Iowa GOP primary?
[02:53:02.565 --> 02:53:15.112]  So, again, they have this new poll out here on Glennbeck's website where it doesn't even mention Ron Paul's name.
[02:53:15.672 --> 02:53:16.313]  It just says,
[02:53:18.698 --> 02:53:19.878]  Right here for everybody.
[02:53:20.878 --> 02:53:23.119]  Who will win the 08 Republican nomination?
[02:53:23.159 --> 02:53:27.060]  Duncan Hunter, Fred Thompson, Mike Huckabee, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani, Tom Pancredo.
[02:53:27.500 --> 02:53:29.940]  That's exactly what they do in these telephone polls.
[02:53:31.120 --> 02:53:34.581]  In the really unfair ones, they just don't give you your other or none.
[02:53:34.841 --> 02:53:36.361]  They just give you those choices.
[02:53:38.602 --> 02:53:42.082]  But in some, again, they just don't even list Ron Paul's name.
[02:53:42.562 --> 02:53:43.602]  Let's take one more call.
[02:53:43.742 --> 02:53:46.043]  Dan in New Hampshire, the key battleground state.
[02:53:46.083 --> 02:53:46.623]  Welcome, Dan.
[02:53:47.483 --> 02:53:51.144]  Hi, and I'm a little worried about the campaign, let me tell you.
[02:53:52.464 --> 02:54:12.328]  You know, there's two things, you know, this business of these supposed disruptive campaign workers at the gun shows, and I don't know whether this guy is, you know, exaggerating or what, but I think we need to look at the possibility of infiltration by
[02:54:14.901 --> 02:54:34.357]  You know, most of the people that I talk to, the Ron Paul supporters, are very intelligent and sensible and, you know, approach you in a reasonable manner to talk, and so I think that basically that's all, that's most of what we are.
[02:54:34.377 --> 02:54:41.563]  Well look, I'm not too worried about the campaign, it's exploding, and I think that that gun show owner sounded kind of, did you hear him backpedal?
[02:54:42.466 --> 02:54:45.248]  Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, but there's another thing beyond that.
[02:54:45.308 --> 02:55:05.884]  Let me tell you, a friend of mine who's not particularly a Ron Paul supporter, as a matter of fact he's backing Edwards, but he tells me he's got 12 to 15 calls, an automated call to talk about, you know,
[02:55:06.773 --> 02:55:07.433]  Ron Paul.
[02:55:07.453 --> 02:55:07.853]  Well, wait.
[02:55:08.273 --> 02:55:12.755]  It's actually come out that there's been some dirty tricks with those, with Ron Paul things.
[02:55:12.855 --> 02:55:13.735]  So, yeah.
[02:55:13.775 --> 02:55:14.475]  Dirty tricks?
[02:55:14.735 --> 02:55:15.095]  I hear you.
[02:55:15.115 --> 02:55:15.976]  I gotta jump here.
[02:55:16.316 --> 02:55:18.837]  We're at the end of the show here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:19.977 --> 02:55:28.859]  In the first hour, I got into Giuliani, Bilderberg Group, tied in with his running mate, who I believe is going to be his running mate, they're now saying he may be, Governor Perry, endorsing him.
[02:55:28.879 --> 02:55:33.981]  The first hour was key, as every day it is, but particularly key today.
