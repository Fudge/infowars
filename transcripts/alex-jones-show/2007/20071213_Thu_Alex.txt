[00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:06.372]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:08.113]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.794 --> 00:00:09.894]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.534 --> 00:00:11.375]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:13.076]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.696 --> 00:00:17.618]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:22.661]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:31.025]  The credit crisis is deepening as more and more states try to pull their money out of derivative funds.
[00:00:33.072 --> 00:00:35.654]  They're being told, hey, the money doesn't really exist.
[00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:41.999]  The dollar continues its meteoric plunge.
[00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:54.189]  There is massive news on the New World Order front, a great victory for the New World Order, bringing England deeper into the European Constitution.
[00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.813]  But there was also a counter-strike by rebel forces as the majority
[00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:08.411]  The individuals of the European Parliament who are from the Member States but aren't allowed to vote on it internally stood up with giant plaques and placards saying that it was tyranny.
[00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:14.553]  So the New World Order is... and there is a European Union, okay?
[00:01:14.593 --> 00:01:18.534]  Just for neocons and liberals out there who don't believe any of this is happening.
[00:01:19.174 --> 00:01:21.175]  England is being forced into this.
[00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:23.695]  Right now Europe doesn't want in it.
[00:01:24.976 --> 00:01:28.457]  Two years ago they had a referendum and European nations pulled out.
[00:01:29.211 --> 00:01:31.573]  And the bureaucracy said, you can't do that.
[00:01:32.313 --> 00:01:33.494]  And that's what this is.
[00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:36.176]  And they're also forcing England in.
[00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:39.058]  But that's the good news.
[00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:41.319]  They're showing everyone what they are.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.861]  And they can't say the European Union doesn't exist.
[00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.603]  They can't say they're trying to force England into it.
[00:01:47.983 --> 00:01:53.047]  It's in all the major German, Dutch, French, British papers.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.764]  But there are actually some people out there denying that the European Union's even expanding by stealth.
[00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:05.329]  I mean, you think it's amazing that they deny we're going into a North American Union here.
[00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:07.350]  They're denying it in Europe!
[00:02:09.532 --> 00:02:14.676]  It's a military tactic to just deny something's going on while it's actually happening.
[00:02:15.757 --> 00:02:18.099]  Also, I'm going to spend most of this first hour
[00:02:19.088 --> 00:02:20.109]  We're good to go.
[00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:42.476]  Three or four days ago I spent hours trying to watch them all.
[00:02:42.676 --> 00:02:44.676]  I spent a couple hours last night.
[00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:46.176]  I spent two hours this morning.
[00:02:46.737 --> 00:02:51.137]  I said that I was going to announce the winner today during the show.
[00:02:54.158 --> 00:02:58.439]  The problem is that I've got like 20 finalists.
[00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.999]  This is so hard to do.
[00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.860]  So many of these video ads and audio ads
[00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:06.740]  We're good to go.
[00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:30.165]  So, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[00:03:30.185 --> 00:03:46.174]  I mean, what do you do when there's like 80, 90 of these things, and then there's even more of them that I guess didn't know, I guess they just heard it on the radio, didn't pay attention to the rules, didn't email Kurt Nemo over to truthnews.us to get themselves listed.
[00:03:46.494 --> 00:03:48.736]  I don't know how Nemo can even keep track of all these.
[00:03:50.056 --> 00:03:53.438]  I've gotta announce the winner.
[00:03:53.518 --> 00:03:56.020]  I mean, the cutoff date was Monday morning.
[00:03:56.804 --> 00:04:12.166]  And now it's Thursday, and I'm literally just trying to wade through these, and the whole point in doing this, the $2,000 first place prize, the $500 second place, the $100 third place for the video ad, and then one winner for radio, $500,
[00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:24.319]  The point was to make all these TV and radio ads flood YouTube and Google, hopefully have radio stations pick up on some of them and air them, and then have it invade the Internet, and it's done that.
[00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.621]  Some of them have tens of thousands of views.
[00:04:27.042 --> 00:04:31.887]  Most of them, though, only have 500, 600, 700 views on average, because there's so many.
[00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:39.334]  So the bigger job is for everybody to go to truthandnews.us, get that page of Ron Paul TV and radio ads,
[00:04:40.277 --> 00:04:43.919]  Some of them were just submitted directly to us, and so they're just on the site.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.980]  Put those on YouTube, get them out.
[00:04:46.321 --> 00:04:49.863]  I mean, this is an info bomb, but we gotta drop these bombs.
[00:04:50.543 --> 00:04:53.125]  Pilot to Bombineer, we are approaching the target.
[00:04:54.205 --> 00:04:58.628]  So, literally, my head's spinning because you just did such a great job.
[00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:00.649]  I don't know what we're gonna do.
[00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.331]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.411 --> 00:05:05.412]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.158 --> 00:05:11.182]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:12.803]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:05:13.864 --> 00:05:16.105]  Don't their objectives mean world domination?
[00:05:16.666 --> 00:05:19.108]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.848 --> 00:05:27.193]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.183]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.644 --> 00:05:39.126]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.506 --> 00:05:42.008]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:05:42.068 --> 00:05:43.229]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.969]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.090]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.031]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.291 --> 00:05:47.151]  That's what happens here.

[00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:07.697]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:07:08.137 --> 00:07:12.858]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:07:13.258 --> 00:07:15.899]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:19.800]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.881]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:25.321 --> 00:07:28.521]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:31.942]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:07:32.722 --> 00:07:34.863]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:34.883 --> 00:07:36.984]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:07:37.004 --> 00:07:37.044]  U.S.
[00:07:37.364 --> 00:07:39.464]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:40.325]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:07:40.385 --> 00:07:41.145]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:07:41.165 --> 00:07:41.965]  Ask for George.
[00:08:02.034 --> 00:08:04.216]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.796 --> 00:08:07.598]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.622 --> 00:08:51.685]  I've got more than 20 radio and TV ads that our listeners have made for the Ron Paul 2008 election with the primaries coming up and coming up at the bottom of the hour in the rest of this hour I'm going to attempt to play all of these and there's so many I hardly even have time to tell you the title of each one or
[00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:54.492]  Who even made it?
[00:08:55.052 --> 00:09:09.800]  Just go to TruthNews.us later today after the show or during the show and copy the list of links, there's more than 50 of them, and send them out to everybody you know.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.323]  Because the great work that everybody has done, and each and every one of them is excellent.
[00:09:14.983 --> 00:09:18.745]  There's got to be 20 of them, however many there are,
[00:09:19.837 --> 00:09:23.678]  Uh, that are just absolutely, uh, stunning.
[00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:29.100]  And I ran out of time last night and this morning trying to judge them.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.601]  And then Kurt Nemo, I had, I told him, I said, okay, well tell me your top five TV ads, your top two radio ads.
[00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:39.102]  I told Aaron that, uh, three or four days ago.
[00:09:39.762 --> 00:09:41.483]  They sent me different selections.
[00:09:41.743 --> 00:09:45.664]  I thought there'd be some kind of, um, consensus.
[00:09:46.855 --> 00:09:48.536]  And then I know why there's not a consensus.
[00:09:48.656 --> 00:09:53.919]  I went and watched these days ago, last night, this morning, and I'm like, oh, that's the winner.
[00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:56.520]  And then I watch another one again and I go, oh, that's the winner.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:58.721]  And then I go, oh, that's the winner.
[00:09:58.881 --> 00:09:59.601]  Oh, that's the winner.
[00:10:01.162 --> 00:10:06.985]  If I had a few more days, I guess I could take emails from everybody and see what your comments are and your angles and your ideas.
[00:10:07.345 --> 00:10:10.747]  I also want to give Kurt Nemo time, Paul Watson time, Steve Watson time,
[00:10:11.531 --> 00:10:28.745]  Ryan Slick is in time, Aaron Dykstheim to write articles about these different ads and analyze them and comment on them, you know, to get the buzz going on them also, because that's the whole point of this, is so these go viral, and so we get, you know, a whole bunch of ads out there that wouldn't have been produced, and that's now happened.
[00:10:29.565 --> 00:10:31.227]  But we've made the munitions
[00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:40.391]  And already, I would say there's got to be over 100,000 views of all of them together, but that's nothing compared to what they're going to be if you go to truthnews.us.
[00:10:40.832 --> 00:10:47.094]  And by the way, we made the ad contest rules where truthnews.us wouldn't even get any attention.
[00:10:47.554 --> 00:10:54.637]  Because I wanted to depoliticize this and get my name out of it, but at the same time fund the prize money so people would make them.
[00:10:54.697 --> 00:11:00.960]  And to be a focal point for folks that most of them are saying they're just going to donate the prize money to Ron Paul.
[00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:07.153]  So it's just a focal point and a reason to go out and make more Ron Paul radio and TV ads.
[00:11:08.813 --> 00:11:17.557]  So I commend and salute all of you that entered into the month-long contest from November into December 10th.
[00:11:18.418 --> 00:11:22.920]  But it should be announced this evening who the winners are.
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:25.721]  If not, it'll be announced tomorrow.
[00:11:28.544 --> 00:11:33.246]  I just, I mean, I could just pick somebody and say, okay, you're first place, you're second place, you're third place.
[00:11:34.687 --> 00:11:42.591]  But I'm not normally undecisive, indecisive, whatever the word is, and I'm just, I just can't decide what I think the best is.
[00:11:44.832 --> 00:11:49.334]  There's five or six video TV ads in there that are just excellent.
[00:11:50.215 --> 00:11:54.717]  And there's another 15 or so that are really good, but I'm down to about five
[00:11:55.552 --> 00:11:56.813]  We're good to go.
[00:12:18.189 --> 00:12:20.050]  Submissions actually did that.
[00:12:20.611 --> 00:12:26.995]  And they're good, they just aren't as powerful as some of the other ads that didn't do what we suggested.
[00:12:27.576 --> 00:12:34.460]  So then I feel like I ought to give one of those to the second place.
[00:12:35.441 --> 00:12:46.629]  But then, just for artistry and great compilation, great makeup,
[00:12:48.132 --> 00:12:51.474]  The content that the others should get second place.
[00:12:52.814 --> 00:12:59.177]  I'm just giving you a window into my brain because, well, I'm sure people who've judged things before know it's hard.
[00:12:59.197 --> 00:13:08.461]  Maybe we should create a section today on the Prison Planet Forum.
[00:13:08.761 --> 00:13:12.183]  Big link up at the top of PrisonPlanet.com if you haven't gone and
[00:13:13.357 --> 00:13:15.859]  Gotten a username and become a member of the Prison Planet Forum.
[00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:17.419]  Maybe we should create a section right now.
[00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:23.043]  In fact, I'll call Paul and have him do that if the moderators aren't listening and don't in the next 30 minutes or so.
[00:13:23.783 --> 00:13:32.108]  And you can go in there and maybe debate and give me your ideas because that will maybe be the tiebreaker here.
[00:13:32.968 --> 00:13:37.831]  But then it's a great job to even go and watch all of these.
[00:13:38.552 --> 00:13:39.892]  So good luck.
[00:13:41.093 --> 00:13:42.494]  Good luck is all I can say.
[00:13:44.145 --> 00:13:46.406]  It's kind of a Catch-22 like everything else is in life.
[00:13:46.446 --> 00:13:47.106]  A paradox.
[00:13:47.787 --> 00:13:48.327]  An enigma.
[00:13:48.967 --> 00:13:54.169]  Because you end up making so many ads, how do we make those all go viral?
[00:13:57.691 --> 00:13:59.452]  Well, obviously we're going to push the three winners.
[00:13:59.532 --> 00:14:00.272]  There'll be four winners.
[00:14:00.312 --> 00:14:01.792]  Three video winners, one radio winner.
[00:14:03.633 --> 00:14:06.815]  But I have babbled enough about that.
[00:14:08.815 --> 00:14:10.556]  We've got some really good news here.
[00:14:10.576 --> 00:14:12.357]  A lot of good signs.
[00:14:13.462 --> 00:14:18.425]  Iran invasion put on hold for now, but there's storm clouds still on the horizon.
[00:14:18.485 --> 00:14:21.007]  Israel's saying, let me just go ahead and strike Iran themselves.
[00:14:21.687 --> 00:14:23.968]  No doubt, then Iran will counter-strike.
[00:14:24.909 --> 00:14:35.435]  That will be called a terrorist act by the media, and the Unconditional Defense Treaty with Israel will kick in and we'll be off the races.
[00:14:35.475 --> 00:14:42.820]  But all the posturing, except for Israel, globally looks like that they are disengaging
[00:14:43.882 --> 00:14:47.004]  Uh, the, uh, warmocks for now.
[00:14:49.686 --> 00:14:52.288]  Warmock, I think that's the term for a German battleship.
[00:14:52.348 --> 00:14:54.029]  It's a menacing war machine.
[00:14:54.689 --> 00:14:57.711]  One of its other definitions, if memory serves.
[00:14:57.791 --> 00:15:04.976]  But, uh, it looks like they are disengaging some of the propaganda campaign, de-escalating that.
[00:15:05.917 --> 00:15:08.999]  And another good sign, Russia, Iran agree on nuclear deal.
[00:15:09.019 --> 00:15:11.000]  BBC, Russia and Iran have agreed
[00:15:13.163 --> 00:15:27.487]  For a schedule for finishing building the Bashir nuclear plant reports from Russia say, difficulties with the Iranian client are resolved and we have agreed on the timetable for construction to the head of the Russian state contractor.
[00:15:27.907 --> 00:15:33.448]  Yeah, the Russians had stopped working on it a year ago and they were waiting for the bombardments.
[00:15:33.488 --> 00:15:37.349]  This is another sign that, and it is by the way, a peaceful reactor.
[00:15:37.369 --> 00:15:40.190]  The UN's been climbing all over it, the Russians have.
[00:15:40.874 --> 00:15:41.374]  The U.S.
[00:15:41.414 --> 00:15:42.475]  has U.S.
[00:15:42.495 --> 00:15:43.696]  inspectors with the U.N.
[00:15:44.396 --> 00:15:49.299]  And so that's another sign now that Russia thinks the heat is off, at least for now.
[00:15:49.359 --> 00:15:52.782]  We'll get more into these reports in an American Free Press report here.
[00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:54.743]  Iran invasion put on hold.
[00:15:55.904 --> 00:16:01.627]  The bad news does have a wrinkle of good news in it.
[00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:07.331]  EU chaos as heckling British
[00:16:09.057 --> 00:16:13.839]  MEPs chanting referendum order to leave Parliament.
[00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:22.383]  But it wasn't just the British that were chanting, but this is the Daily Mail out of England, so they're focusing on the Anglo-centric angle there.
[00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:28.046]  It was meant to be a solemn event marking the new EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.
[00:16:28.566 --> 00:16:29.587]  Sounds nice, doesn't it?
[00:16:30.147 --> 00:16:31.948]  You actually read it, it's a merger treaty.
[00:16:33.596 --> 00:16:45.904]  Instead, the European Parliament descended into chaos today as more than 100 lawmakers jeered, booed, and heckled in a noisy protest against the new EU reform treaty due to be signed tomorrow.
[00:16:46.865 --> 00:16:47.545]  Here's another one.
[00:16:49.026 --> 00:16:57.772]  Miliband signs EU treaty for Britain as experts warn UK will surrender control on immigration as well as its courts, I would add.
[00:16:58.778 --> 00:17:02.120]  And we're going to break this down here in just a moment.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.362]  Also, there's a lot of media push now to go, yeah, we're torturing people.
[00:17:06.402 --> 00:17:06.782]  It's good.
[00:17:06.822 --> 00:17:07.262]  It's loving.
[00:17:07.302 --> 00:17:09.423]  It keeps you safe from LCI.
[00:17:10.044 --> 00:17:28.153]  And a bunch of news again on the economic front, the unraveling, not just subprime mortgage crises, but all the other debt pyramid schemes now coming to a head in a perfect storm of perfect storms.
[00:17:29.315 --> 00:17:47.504]  A nightmarish vortex of unraveling leveraged debt structures, corporate, private, governmental, as well as the dollar's continual descent into the ne'er-do-well pits of the peso and the ruble.
[00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:58.770]  But right now, back to EU chaos is heckling British members of
[00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.933]  European Parliament chanting referendum order to leave.
[00:18:03.073 --> 00:18:10.920]  Now, first off, they kept the EU Treaty secret.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:25.233]  They only put out a summary a year ago, and then there were lots of articles in the British and European press about how it's a conspiracy theory, this is not expanding the European Treaty that failed two years ago, but you can't see it.
[00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:51.885]  And then the British government and others leaked it, and now it's been public for six months, and it indeed merges England through its judiciary and through its treaty agreements, and subordinates its sovereignty, as well as France and others who, when they have finally allowed a referendum, the people voted to get out of the EU and to knock down EU expansion.
[00:18:52.620 --> 00:18:53.540]  And so what do they do?
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.841]  They just simply repackage it as a reform bill.
[00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:02.322]  And it's not just me saying that.
[00:19:02.342 --> 00:19:04.482]  Let's go ahead and read the Daily Mail here.
[00:19:06.063 --> 00:19:19.485]  Portuguese Prime Minister José Socrates, if I'm pronouncing that right, Socrates, whose country currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency, had to face down the hecklers in Parliament.
[00:19:20.282 --> 00:19:24.244]  Wearing black t-shirts and holding placards demanding referendums on the treaty.
[00:19:24.524 --> 00:19:32.568]  The lawmakers from countries including Britain, France, Poland and Italy shouted down the EU President as he delivered his speech.
[00:19:32.588 --> 00:19:38.811]  When we get back, we'll get into the real meat, the real heart of the matter.
[00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:45.835]  And the same chicanery and globalist expansion by stealth
[00:19:46.835 --> 00:19:56.595]  That we see in the European Union's hegemonic rise is run by the very same people here in the North American sub-region.
[00:19:57.156 --> 00:19:58.279]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.434 --> 00:20:03.515]  Gold is like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:03.775 --> 00:20:09.856]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:10.036 --> 00:20:13.858]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:14.218 --> 00:20:16.098]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:16.158 --> 00:20:18.439]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:18.579 --> 00:20:25.961]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:20:26.001 --> 00:20:26.943]  We're good to go.
[00:20:41.465 --> 00:20:47.067]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:20:47.387 --> 00:20:49.948]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:52.229 --> 00:20:56.310]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:20:56.330 --> 00:20:57.491]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.731 --> 00:21:03.191]  Thank you.
[00:21:22.097 --> 00:21:27.582]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:21:39.672 --> 00:21:41.694]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:00.982 --> 00:22:01.623]  It's a fact.
[00:22:01.863 --> 00:22:09.329]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:22:09.469 --> 00:22:18.337]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:22:18.617 --> 00:22:29.146]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:22:29.406 --> 00:22:35.470]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.713]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:45.375]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:22:45.535 --> 00:22:47.336]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:22:47.356 --> 00:22:47.557]  That's 877-943-8600.

[00:23:17.441 --> 00:23:22.423]  Berkey systems are ideal for every member of your family, especially the young ones in college.
[00:23:22.663 --> 00:23:26.245]  Unlike other water filtration systems, Berkey purifiers are portable.
[00:23:26.285 --> 00:23:30.587]  They require no plumbing, and the elements don't have to be replaced every four to six months.

[00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:41.532]  That's because Berkey systems are able to purify raw, untreated water.

[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:52.920]  That's 888-03-4438.
[00:24:03.271 --> 00:24:09.954]  I think that a parasitic dream will never come back That painted my hands and face blue And suddenly I saw the life I owe
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:36.071]  Alright, getting back to this EU report.
[00:24:36.131 --> 00:24:40.915]  Jose Socrates, I guess you pronounce it Socrates even though it's Portuguese.
[00:24:44.051 --> 00:24:56.343]  Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates, whose country currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency, had to face down the hecklers in Parliament wearing black t-shirts and holding placards demanding referendums on the treaty.
[00:24:56.383 --> 00:24:58.065]  The lawmakers from countries including France,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:04.184]  Britain, Poland, and Italy shouted down Socrates as he delivered his speech.
[00:25:04.245 --> 00:25:12.932]  And it continues, no matter how loud you heckle and yell, today is a day of fundamental importance for Europe, a defiant looking Socrates told the Assembly.
[00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:23.961]  The ceremony at the Parliament was held to mark the signing of the charter of the EU's three institutions, the European Parliament, European Commission, and the European Council, which represent the member states.
[00:25:25.552 --> 00:25:27.733]  And again, they're merging those three right now.
[00:25:28.253 --> 00:25:35.677]  The event took place a day before the 27 EU leaders will sign the bloc's new reform treaty in Lisbon.
[00:25:36.517 --> 00:25:41.980]  The treaty retains key parts of a doomed... See, it failed two years ago.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:47.482]  They voted for EU expansion from, what, 17 members first?
[00:25:47.522 --> 00:25:50.924]  It was 10, then 14, then 15, then 17, and it was going to expand to 27 nations.
[00:25:54.349 --> 00:26:00.772]  And France and a bunch of other countries said, uh-uh, we're having referendums, we don't want to expand into Turkey.
[00:26:01.112 --> 00:26:03.233]  We don't want to expand into Georgia.
[00:26:03.453 --> 00:26:05.194]  We don't want to expand into Ukraine.
[00:26:05.694 --> 00:26:08.456]  We don't want to expand into all these countries.
[00:26:08.796 --> 00:26:10.056]  And they just said, oh yeah?
[00:26:10.276 --> 00:26:11.217]  Well, we're doing it!
[00:26:12.077 --> 00:26:12.697]  Shut up!
[00:26:13.658 --> 00:26:17.180]  And depending on which poll you look at, it's between the mid-70s and the 90s.
[00:26:18.846 --> 00:26:21.188]  In Europe, and in England, they don't want this.
[00:26:21.588 --> 00:26:24.571]  England hasn't fully been forced in yet, they don't want it.
[00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:28.033]  They won't let the people ever have a vote on getting out of what they're already in.
[00:26:29.694 --> 00:26:31.135]  What does Gordon Brown do?
[00:26:31.176 --> 00:26:32.416]  He goes over there and signs it.
[00:26:34.438 --> 00:26:40.823]  He does it in a, quote, closed door meeting because it's so unpopular, and you watch, he'll say in a month he never signed it.
[00:26:41.003 --> 00:26:42.304]  They'll say it doesn't exist!
[00:26:43.085 --> 00:26:44.586]  They do the same thing with the SPP!
[00:26:45.706 --> 00:26:50.271]  They treat you like you are complete morons!
[00:26:51.633 --> 00:26:53.114]  And frankly, some people are.
[00:26:53.154 --> 00:26:54.336]  This works on some people.
[00:26:55.277 --> 00:26:58.641]  But it's not working when you've got 75, 85, 90% saying no now.
[00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:04.527]  I've got to say, Europeans are more well-read and informed on average because they've been in tyranny a long time.
[00:27:04.828 --> 00:27:05.789]  They've been in big wars.
[00:27:06.445 --> 00:27:07.626]  They've been slaves.
[00:27:07.946 --> 00:27:20.171]  Americans have just had it so good, we have gone from the greatest in the world, no debating that, historians worldwide came here and noted it, the intelligence, the viciousness, the ingenuity, the creativity.
[00:27:20.451 --> 00:27:23.332]  Now we are the slobs of earth, the scum of earth.
[00:27:23.832 --> 00:27:25.993]  Not all of us, I'm saying on average.
[00:27:26.293 --> 00:27:27.594]  We got more scum
[00:27:28.414 --> 00:27:32.516]  And more idiots and more dumbed-down fools than anybody.
[00:27:32.576 --> 00:27:33.917]  The test scores all show it.
[00:27:34.377 --> 00:27:40.099]  There are a whole bunch of third world countries on average more intelligent, more well-read in international tests.
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:41.760]  Scores of them ahead of us.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.001]  We are a joke.
[00:27:43.861 --> 00:27:45.202]  We have to admit what we are.
[00:27:45.462 --> 00:27:47.543]  We are slovenly scum!
[00:27:49.904 --> 00:27:50.404]  I'm sorry.
[00:27:50.544 --> 00:27:51.385]  Myself included.
[00:27:51.665 --> 00:27:52.845]  I'm scum.
[00:27:52.865 --> 00:27:54.686]  I mean, we really are.
[00:27:54.866 --> 00:27:56.447]  We just have become slovenly trash.
[00:27:57.555 --> 00:27:58.155]  I'm just getting mad.
[00:27:58.175 --> 00:27:58.496]  I'm sorry.
[00:27:58.536 --> 00:27:59.076]  I'm going to slow down.
[00:28:00.417 --> 00:28:05.980]  The ceremony at the Parliament was held to mark the signing of the Charter by the EU's three institutions.
[00:28:07.221 --> 00:28:13.645]  The European Parliament, European Commission, European Council, which are merging under new rules, which are dictatorial.
[00:28:13.905 --> 00:28:14.925]  You ought to go read the treaty.
[00:28:15.266 --> 00:28:16.706]  It's just, it's total tyranny.
[00:28:17.667 --> 00:28:22.730]  All the old liberties and freedoms that Europe still had have been swept away.
[00:28:25.501 --> 00:28:37.424]  The treaty retains key parts of the doomed, but it's not doomed, EU constitution, including provisions to boost EU foreign policy and make the rights charter legally binding.
[00:28:37.484 --> 00:28:38.644]  And you read the rights charter?
[00:28:39.224 --> 00:28:45.146]  It says, you don't have free speech, you don't have jack, but it puts it all in flowery doublespeak.
[00:28:47.286 --> 00:28:54.988]  The treaty retains key parts of a doomed EU constitution, including provisions to boost EU foreign policy and make the rights charter legally binding.
[00:28:55.956 --> 00:28:59.277]  Except in Britain and Poland, which won opt-outs.
[00:28:59.417 --> 00:29:00.737]  Oh, they won opt-outs!
[00:29:01.097 --> 00:29:03.638]  But they didn't really win opt-outs.
[00:29:03.898 --> 00:29:12.721]  They have created new little councils that report to their governments, and then they claim when their little courts want to, they can opt-out.
[00:29:13.001 --> 00:29:19.802]  So a new layer of bureaucracy in England and Poland that decide which legal system they want to be under.
[00:29:20.503 --> 00:29:25.244]  British and Polish common law, or jump back over the fence into Roman civil.
[00:29:25.956 --> 00:29:26.596]  Or trade law.
[00:29:29.077 --> 00:29:30.497]  And don't think that just deals with trade.
[00:29:30.537 --> 00:29:34.738]  When CPS grabs your kids with no warrant, no nothing, that's trade law.
[00:29:35.138 --> 00:29:36.058]  That's admiralty.
[00:29:37.018 --> 00:29:39.139]  It's older than common law.
[00:29:40.039 --> 00:29:42.599]  It is the law of the tyrants.
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:48.821]  It is the law of the elite feeding like wolves on our blood.
[00:29:48.861 --> 00:29:49.601]  We're on the march.
[00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:50.321]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.837 --> 00:29:58.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.698 --> 00:30:03.039]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[00:30:03.379 --> 00:30:08.880]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.

[00:30:17.802 --> 00:30:18.403]  We're good to go.
[00:30:33.257 --> 00:30:37.140]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.

[00:30:41.364 --> 00:30:45.047]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:30:45.087 --> 00:30:46.588]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:08.303]  Hi, I'm Lynette Brooks, founder of MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse combining the healing power of flaxseed with the detoxification of bentonite clay.
[00:31:08.623 --> 00:31:14.646]  In a perfect world, we would eat natural healthy foods, but the foods we eat today are not the foods nature intended for us.
[00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:16.767]  Fast food is toxic food.
[00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:20.788]  I've been producing MediCleanse for over 20 years, and customers from across the U.S.
[00:31:20.808 --> 00:31:29.052]  say that MediCleanse helps your body detoxify from fast foods as well as other environmental poisons, such as heavy metals and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:31:29.432 --> 00:31:31.974]  For centuries, flax has been known as nature's superfood.
[00:31:32.455 --> 00:31:39.500]  Even the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.984]  A one-month supply of MediCleanse is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:31:44.104 --> 00:31:49.949]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com for only $22.95 plus shipping and handling.
[00:31:50.109 --> 00:31:50.949]  Or call me today at 1-800-317-9547.
[00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:51.230]  That's 800-317-9547.
[00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:53.071]  Radiant health has never been easier.
[00:32:01.014 --> 00:32:02.834]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:02.975 --> 00:32:08.136]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:32:08.156 --> 00:32:09.676]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:32:09.956 --> 00:32:18.118]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:18.338 --> 00:32:24.120]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:25.620]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:26.460]  I think so.
[00:32:42.645 --> 00:32:43.285]  I don't think so.
[00:33:07.188 --> 00:33:08.709]  We are back live.
[00:33:08.769 --> 00:33:13.233]  Remember, you've got until Sunday at midnight, going into Monday morning.
[00:33:14.334 --> 00:33:29.247]  They're going to come in Monday morning and whatever is in the shopping cart order box, whatever is on the toll-free line computer system where they've entered those orders, that is the orders that you're guaranteed to get by Christmas.
[00:33:30.187 --> 00:33:32.749]  Within days before Christmas, we want to just be safe.
[00:33:32.769 --> 00:33:34.970]  We could run it out until Tuesday, Wednesday, but we're not doing that.
[00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:37.271]  Then we're going to ship all that out on Monday.
[00:33:37.911 --> 00:33:42.814]  All of that out on Monday, so that you should get it by Friday in almost everywhere in the country.
[00:33:42.914 --> 00:33:45.256]  Maybe Saturday in places like Alaska.
[00:33:45.856 --> 00:33:49.458]  So if you're wanting to give somebody endgame blueprint for global enslavement,
[00:33:49.958 --> 00:33:51.459]  I mean, what film could be more important?
[00:33:51.639 --> 00:34:10.626]  The North American Union, the EU, how they're already merging the North American Union with the EU, public video of Bush saying it, and then the media acts like he didn't say it on the White House lawn, all the documents, their internal documents, video of the global elite, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Queen of the Netherlands meeting, from Istanbul, Turkey, to Ottawa, Canada.
[00:34:10.886 --> 00:34:12.607]  I mean, this is an epic film.
[00:34:15.703 --> 00:34:17.786]  Five years ago, this would have cost a million dollars.
[00:34:17.906 --> 00:34:19.909]  Twenty years ago, it would have cost twenty million dollars.
[00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:26.478]  It's only the developments in technology that allowed six, seven people and a hundred and fifty thousand dollars to be able to make this film.
[00:34:27.299 --> 00:34:29.663]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:34:30.223 --> 00:34:32.747]  I mean, this is a professional two-hour, twenty-minute film.
[00:34:33.502 --> 00:34:46.173]  With 40 minutes of extras, which are many films in their own right, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, to order off the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart, or call toll-free today, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:34:46.193 --> 00:34:46.753]  888-253-3139.
[00:34:46.773 --> 00:34:51.237]  And all the mail that comes in through Saturday, mail doesn't run on Sunday,
[00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:17.926]  Those orders will get out by Monday too, but if you're going to write to us to get the books, the videos, the tapes, to get your order in, the t-shirts, the bumper stickers, the pocket constitutions, all of it, then you need to, you know, two day, three day mail that letter.
[00:35:18.607 --> 00:35:21.590]  I guess it's already Thursday, you better overnight it, or you better two day it.
[00:35:22.279 --> 00:35:26.020]  To Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:30.942]  Again, Alex Jones, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:35:31.022 --> 00:35:35.604]  And of course, right up until Christmas Day, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:35:49.173 --> 00:35:52.916]  And you can create your own username and password in about a minute.
[00:35:53.557 --> 00:35:56.139]  Sign up for $5.95 for a monthly trial subscription.
[00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:57.460]  Let me just give you a Christmas present.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.962]  I know my audience is so honest, it's ridiculous.
[00:36:00.863 --> 00:36:03.245]  You can share the passcode with one person.
[00:36:04.265 --> 00:36:06.567]  I know a lot of you already do that, but some of you have to be told.
[00:36:07.348 --> 00:36:15.614]  It allows, what, three different IP addresses to access it each day until it'll lock you out if you do more than that, because it used to crash our servers.
[00:36:16.155 --> 00:36:17.216]  We ought to turn that up now.
[00:36:17.256 --> 00:36:18.617]  We've got even more powerful servers.
[00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:21.286]  Frankly, I just want the info getting out.
[00:36:21.506 --> 00:36:27.088]  And at PrisonPlanet.TV, the quality is so good.
[00:36:27.208 --> 00:36:28.688]  I mean, look at the test clips.
[00:36:28.708 --> 00:36:29.548]  Look at the trailers.
[00:36:30.009 --> 00:36:36.911]  Not on YouTube or Google, but look at the trailers for Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, on PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:36:36.951 --> 00:36:40.792]  Look at the super high quality, the medium quality, and the lower res.
[00:36:41.172 --> 00:36:43.733]  But even the lower res is like ten times better than Google.
[00:36:43.873 --> 00:36:45.434]  I mean, the high res
[00:36:46.548 --> 00:36:47.089]  I think so.
[00:37:02.927 --> 00:37:05.349]  There's different software programs, different free downloads.
[00:37:05.429 --> 00:37:10.534]  We ought to post those on the site, by the way, to make prisonplanet.tv easier to access in the info war.
[00:37:10.574 --> 00:37:11.395]  In fact, we're going to do that.
[00:37:11.415 --> 00:37:12.415]  I just thought of that.
[00:37:12.816 --> 00:37:13.977]  We'll get that up in the next week or so.
[00:37:14.297 --> 00:37:21.283]  We'll find out the best systems to rip the stuff off the server or off the streams, off the flash, and burn them to disk.
[00:37:21.303 --> 00:37:24.006]  Because I want you to use prisonplanet.tv.
[00:37:24.266 --> 00:37:29.991]  You see a TV report I do, you see a radio report I do where I shoot video of it that you think is important on a certain subject,
[00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:31.530]  Burn it to disc.
[00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:32.850]  Burn it to DVD.
[00:37:33.491 --> 00:37:35.472]  Uh, you see, uh, Endgame.
[00:37:35.532 --> 00:37:37.933]  Just go in there and just make hundreds of copies.
[00:37:39.254 --> 00:37:42.856]  Now, it'd be even better to get the actual DVD and make copies from that, but whatever.
[00:37:43.296 --> 00:37:44.757]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:45.097 --> 00:37:46.538]  Five free months.
[00:37:48.112 --> 00:37:53.594]  When you sign up now for a year, you pay for a little more than six months, 6.7 months, you get 5.3 months free.
[00:37:53.854 --> 00:37:55.275]  That's exactly what it comes out to.
[00:37:55.695 --> 00:38:03.618]  Five plus months free right now at PrisonPlanet.tv and for all the members that are already members, A, I want to thank you for your support.
[00:38:03.818 --> 00:38:04.699]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:38:04.759 --> 00:38:14.763]  B, if you haven't started burning and started downloading these and started putting these on disk, you put it on a normal CD that cost you 25 cents,
[00:38:16.427 --> 00:38:19.348]  Uh, in bulk or even cheaper if you want to have it medium rest.
[00:38:19.908 --> 00:38:21.189]  Or, go all the way.
[00:38:21.289 --> 00:38:24.830]  Buy 75 cents or 50 cent DVDs.
[00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:27.511]  And burn it in high quality on there.
[00:38:28.311 --> 00:38:33.733]  I mean, just get aggressive and give it to everybody.
[00:38:35.073 --> 00:38:37.454]  Look, I want to say this before we play all these Ron Paul ads.
[00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:42.695]  And then later on, we got Larry Pratt coming on about some 2nd Amendment defeats and victories.
[00:38:43.315 --> 00:38:47.578]  We're talking a lot of 2nd Amendment the last few months because it's under full-blown attack right now.
[00:38:47.938 --> 00:38:52.260]  See, when you start hearing me talk 2nd Amendment all the time, every few years, that's when the new attack starts.
[00:38:52.900 --> 00:39:00.264]  And then you'll see people email me and say, I haven't heard you talk about the 2nd Amendment in months, or I haven't heard you... Well, I only talk about it when it's under attack.
[00:39:01.045 --> 00:39:05.207]  And it's always under attack here and there, but right now there's a concerted, unified front
[00:39:06.445 --> 00:39:07.285]  I mean, it's bad.
[00:39:08.126 --> 00:39:09.186]  It's really bad.
[00:39:09.867 --> 00:39:12.148]  And some press join us for like 30 minutes next hour.
[00:39:12.168 --> 00:39:18.691]  I'm going to get back into all this EU constitution stuff as a model for what's happening here.
[00:39:20.856 --> 00:39:26.982]  You know, I talk about how Ron Paul, even if he doesn't win, is educating hundreds of millions globally, millions domestically.
[00:39:27.583 --> 00:39:29.004]  He's now a global phenomenon.
[00:39:29.505 --> 00:39:39.194]  I talk about how it builds the muscles for the alternative community and takes the internet community and makes it manifest physically in the streets.
[00:39:39.595 --> 00:39:40.636]  It creates communities.
[00:39:40.676 --> 00:39:42.097]  You meet like-minded people.
[00:39:43.098 --> 00:39:44.119]  It's a focal point.
[00:39:44.199 --> 00:39:44.980]  It's a zeitgeist.
[00:39:46.063 --> 00:39:54.898]  Uh, it is a capacitor through which we can put our energy into and then store it, magnify it, direct it with devastating effect against the globalists.
[00:39:55.239 --> 00:39:56.040]  I mean, they're scared.
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:56.962]  They see Ron Paul.
[00:39:58.209 --> 00:40:03.334]  Like a vampire sees a bucket of holy water being dumped on them.
[00:40:03.394 --> 00:40:05.836]  They run in fear.
[00:40:06.257 --> 00:40:09.320]  Ron Paul's like a giant crucifix to these people.
[00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.062]  That's why they're pulling out all the stops.
[00:40:11.522 --> 00:40:20.952]  But regardless, when you get an opportunity, when you get a champion of liberty, when you get somebody of this caliber, you have a duty, not just a right, to get behind them.
[00:40:22.964 --> 00:40:28.128]  It's this attitude, oh, you can't change anything, oh, you can't do anything, oh, yeah, they're corrupt, but you know, so what?
[00:40:28.588 --> 00:40:32.331]  That's the attitude that's brought us to the brink of absolute serfdom and tyranny.
[00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:35.033]  And Ron Paul is a breath of fresh air.
[00:40:35.073 --> 00:40:35.853]  He's more than that.
[00:40:36.214 --> 00:40:38.335]  I mean, think about how far we've already come.
[00:40:39.996 --> 00:40:42.318]  Ron Paul now is a household word.
[00:40:42.438 --> 00:40:43.759]  They're trying to suppress it, but
[00:40:44.517 --> 00:40:46.179]  I talk to family in Washington State.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.061]  I talk to family in East Texas.
[00:40:48.682 --> 00:40:50.764]  I talk to family in upstate New York.
[00:40:50.824 --> 00:40:53.087]  I talk to cousins and people all over.
[00:40:53.107 --> 00:40:55.550]  I talk to acquaintances and old friends.
[00:40:55.930 --> 00:40:58.313]  They say there's Ron Paul signs coast to coast.
[00:40:58.834 --> 00:41:00.556]  You don't see any other campaign signs.
[00:41:01.437 --> 00:41:01.517]  It's
[00:41:15.994 --> 00:41:18.615]  They're finding out about the Federal Reserve right now!
[00:41:19.115 --> 00:41:20.036]  It's exponential!
[00:41:20.456 --> 00:41:22.056]  They're finding out about the UN!
[00:41:22.237 --> 00:41:24.377]  They're finding out about big government agencies!
[00:41:24.618 --> 00:41:27.599]  They're finding out about the inflation tax!
[00:41:27.619 --> 00:41:33.341]  They're finding out about the New World Order and global government and the North American Union!
[00:41:33.581 --> 00:41:35.622]  We have breached the enemy's defenses!
[00:41:36.062 --> 00:41:41.524]  If the enemy had a walled city, we have basically blasted giant holes in five or six entry points.
[00:41:41.784 --> 00:41:44.406]  A bunch of us have already gone over the wall a long time ago.
[00:41:44.646 --> 00:41:47.207]  We planted the explosives on the wall to breach it.
[00:41:47.947 --> 00:41:54.650]  Already a lot of you have run through, but the majority of you are still standing there thinking you're not leaders, and you haven't gone.
[00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:57.051]  There should be a massive press to force through.
[00:41:57.231 --> 00:42:03.213]  We should be blasting more holes so that as they try to send people in, this is again an analogy or a
[00:42:05.534 --> 00:42:07.215]  Contextualizing what we're doing.
[00:42:07.235 --> 00:42:14.977]  We need to blow more holes in so they can't send their propaganda forces, their forces in, to try to block us at those points.
[00:42:14.997 --> 00:42:16.658]  We need to keep blasting more holes.
[00:42:16.878 --> 00:42:20.399]  Just blasting and blasting and blasting and blasting and blasting!
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.961]  This is history, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:26.401]  This is just the beginning!
[00:42:27.241 --> 00:42:31.743]  I've always told you that as soon as you believe you can defeat these people, we will.
[00:42:32.956 --> 00:42:34.317]  I've studied history.
[00:42:34.397 --> 00:42:35.418]  I know how it works.
[00:42:36.499 --> 00:42:40.542]  And the biggest enemy we've got is these fake churches telling everybody it's the end of the world.
[00:42:40.962 --> 00:42:41.582]  Lay down.
[00:42:41.843 --> 00:42:42.903]  You can't get involved.
[00:42:42.963 --> 00:42:44.284]  It's all foretold.
[00:42:44.344 --> 00:42:45.525]  It's all going to happen.
[00:42:45.845 --> 00:42:47.346]  Humans don't affect anything.
[00:42:47.386 --> 00:42:48.047]  That's a lie.
[00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:49.228]  The Bible doesn't say that.
[00:42:49.428 --> 00:42:54.331]  A. B. Even if the end of the world was next year, we have a duty.
[00:42:55.072 --> 00:42:56.153]  Duty belongs to us.
[00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:57.974]  Consequence is God's.
[00:42:58.815 --> 00:42:59.095]  Okay?
[00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:01.371]  May justice be done!
[00:43:01.411 --> 00:43:02.372]  May the heavens fall!
[00:43:02.772 --> 00:43:03.913]  Stop caring!
[00:43:04.213 --> 00:43:05.374]  Stop being afraid!
[00:43:05.694 --> 00:43:08.996]  Commit yourself to this fight now!
[00:43:10.277 --> 00:43:13.239]  Commit yourself to engage the New World Order!
[00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.381]  Look at what we have happening!
[00:43:16.762 --> 00:43:18.703]  This is wondrous what's happening!
[00:43:18.943 --> 00:43:19.964]  This is amazing!
[00:43:20.024 --> 00:43:21.605]  And it's only the beginning.
[00:43:21.645 --> 00:43:23.346]  They can strike Ron Paul down.
[00:43:23.907 --> 00:43:25.268]  They can strike me down.
[00:43:25.568 --> 00:43:27.149]  They can strike a lot of us down.
[00:43:28.248 --> 00:43:31.694]  But they cannot strike us all down, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:32.255 --> 00:43:33.958]  They can execute their order number 66.
[00:43:34.099 --> 00:43:37.505]  It's already out of the bottle.
[00:43:38.106 --> 00:43:39.809]  Pandora's box is open.
[00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:52.380]  The resistance to the New World Order, the rebellion is now just beginning to move, just beginning to get purchased, just beginning to move forward.
[00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.623]  The cracks in the New World Order facade are becoming visible for the first time.
[00:43:57.863 --> 00:44:03.607]  The enemy has fear in their eyes, and they've got a lot of different cards in their hand.
[00:44:03.947 --> 00:44:09.231]  They can play the Ace of Spades, nuclear attack, buy a weapon release, use that to clamp down and set up
[00:44:09.811 --> 00:44:11.873]  And engage the police state they've already built.
[00:44:12.073 --> 00:44:15.175]  But now the cops and the military know the truth, the vast majority.
[00:44:15.395 --> 00:44:17.137]  Now people know about false flag.
[00:44:17.357 --> 00:44:18.778]  Now people understand!
[00:44:20.019 --> 00:44:23.962]  They can kill us individually, but they cannot kill ideas.
[00:44:24.802 --> 00:44:29.286]  It is invincible with the spirit of God literally leading this fight.
[00:44:29.586 --> 00:44:34.069]  Divine providence, you can see it, you can feel it, you can know it!
[00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:37.132]  Let's go ahead and go to some of these clips.
[00:44:38.763 --> 00:44:42.205]  Now, I'm not playing these in any order of what's the best or what's the worst.
[00:44:42.526 --> 00:44:43.686]  This is 14 of them.
[00:44:45.648 --> 00:44:46.288]  Here's one.
[00:44:46.468 --> 00:44:48.830]  This is, The Establishment is Nervous.
[00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:49.230]  Here it is.
[00:45:09.216 --> 00:45:15.358]  Patriotism is more closely linked to dissent than it is to conformity and a blind desire for safety and security.
[00:45:15.458 --> 00:45:19.659]  Our national sovereignty is under threat.
[00:45:19.699 --> 00:45:22.860]  For some, patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:27.781]  For others, it means dissent against a government's abuse of its people's rights.
[00:45:27.821 --> 00:45:31.622]  Hundreds of billions of dollars by changing one policy.
[00:45:31.662 --> 00:45:37.904]  And that's changing the poor policy that breaks our current law.
[00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:49.152]  Alright.
[00:45:50.053 --> 00:45:51.353]  That's the establishment is nervous.
[00:45:51.393 --> 00:45:52.514]  Now that's a video ad.
[00:45:52.594 --> 00:45:54.615]  It works when you can see his lips moving.
[00:45:54.635 --> 00:45:57.516]  You know, video, you can have the music turned up a little too loud and it works.
[00:45:57.736 --> 00:46:00.137]  It's not as good for radio, but that's a great ad.
[00:46:00.878 --> 00:46:02.659]  Uh, let's go ahead and play The Tick.
[00:46:03.199 --> 00:46:04.980]  And this is one that's got me mixed into it.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.340]  Here it is.
[00:46:06.181 --> 00:46:08.002]  A Ron Paul supporter on government.
[00:46:08.042 --> 00:46:09.802]  We're like a dog dragging a tick around.
[00:46:10.182 --> 00:46:12.703]  The dog weighs 100 pounds, the tick weighs 200 pounds.
[00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:14.163]  The ticks even got ticks.
[00:46:14.503 --> 00:46:15.564]  Now Ron Paul.
[00:46:15.804 --> 00:46:17.624]  Our government is growing endlessly.
[00:46:17.804 --> 00:46:21.365]  And every time government grows, it's at the commencement of personal liberty.
[00:46:21.585 --> 00:46:28.247]  Like most, the Ron Paul supporter lacks Hollywood scriptwriters and handy charts and graphs to tailor his or her message.
[00:46:28.487 --> 00:46:30.009]  What is at stake for us is our freedom.
[00:46:30.029 --> 00:46:32.352]  What is at stake for them is the money and the control and the power.
[00:46:48.271 --> 00:46:55.097]  We're like, oh, your breath's horrible, you stink, you're disgusting, and it's like, no, that's a conspiracy, I'm beautiful!
[00:46:55.217 --> 00:46:56.838]  You love me!
[00:46:57.218 --> 00:47:02.583]  Do your friend, yourself, and your country a favor and research the presidential candidate, Ron Paul.
[00:47:02.883 --> 00:47:04.644]  And I just want this stinking thing off of me.
[00:47:05.165 --> 00:47:06.566]  Yeah, I want this stinking thing off of me.
[00:47:07.227 --> 00:47:08.688]  Uh, Ron Paul remembers.
[00:47:08.708 --> 00:47:09.408]  That's the name of this one.
[00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:15.053]  Well, the most basic question first, Congressman, why are you running for president?
[00:47:15.854 --> 00:47:17.135]  Well, I run to win.
[00:47:17.155 --> 00:47:18.376]  That's the purpose of running.
[00:47:18.896 --> 00:47:29.924]  But I'm introducing a rather radical idea, and that is that I think we should always obey the Constitution.
[00:47:30.225 --> 00:47:40.032]  I am an advocate, a very strong advocate, of following very strictly the rule of law, the Constitution of the United States.
[00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:47.644]  We have allowed our nation to be overtaxed and overregulated and overrun by bureaucrats.
[00:47:47.684 --> 00:47:50.925]  The founders would be ashamed of us for what we're putting up with.
[00:47:51.025 --> 00:48:01.510]  The Constitution was written very precisely to restrain the power and force of government and to protect the liberties of each and every one of us.
[00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:14.863]  I think that most government officials over the past several decades have overdone the use of fear to scare the American people into giving up their liberty.
[00:48:17.225 --> 00:48:21.009]  Freedom is not something new and strange and neither is it ancient.
[00:48:21.529 --> 00:48:22.991]  It's recent.
[00:48:23.051 --> 00:48:24.212]  Tyranny is ancient.
[00:48:24.653 --> 00:48:27.836]  And unfortunately this country is returning to tyranny.
[00:48:28.156 --> 00:48:31.479]  More and more centralized government and more and more control.
[00:48:37.245 --> 00:48:45.409]  Isn't it interesting also that the establishment figure is the one who most defends the Constitution has to be eliminated from the debate.
[00:48:45.449 --> 00:48:51.232]  What's going on in this country?
[00:48:51.552 --> 00:48:57.975]  Our campaign is all about freedom, prosperity, and peace!
[00:49:02.634 --> 00:49:03.695]  Well, that one's excellent.
[00:49:03.715 --> 00:49:04.515]  A little too long.
[00:49:05.275 --> 00:49:08.717]  Let's go ahead now and go to another one.
[00:49:09.977 --> 00:49:11.118]  What are we up to now, John?
[00:49:13.639 --> 00:49:14.659]  Freedom's Got Soul.
[00:49:14.699 --> 00:49:15.420]  This is a nice one.
[00:49:20.442 --> 00:49:26.645]  What I'd like to be is the president that doesn't even have a goal of running your life, running the economy, or running the world.
[00:49:31.545 --> 00:49:35.867]  I wish you would just leave me alone.
[00:49:35.947 --> 00:49:41.309]  You know I need to go to work and get some money for the baby.
[00:49:41.449 --> 00:49:45.691]  I wish I could help.
[00:49:46.271 --> 00:49:48.032]  All y'all up on Capitol Hill.
[00:49:48.312 --> 00:49:50.473]  I know you getting your thrill.
[00:49:50.493 --> 00:49:52.934]  But I just want you to leave me alone.
[00:49:52.974 --> 00:49:55.175]  Leave my mother and my brother alone.
[00:50:12.638 --> 00:50:13.678]  Freedom's got sold.
[00:50:13.698 --> 00:50:16.359]  When we come back, we're going to get to a whole bunch of them.
[00:50:16.379 --> 00:50:17.419]  We just played four of them.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.281]  And I've got, what, ten more of these babies.
[00:50:21.621 --> 00:50:24.282]  And there's like, I don't know, I haven't counted them all up.
[00:50:25.308 --> 00:50:28.789]  And we got a bunch that came in too late, but we're going to go ahead and post those.
[00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:32.409]  In fact, I should have told Nemo to just go ahead and post all the ones that came in late.
[00:50:32.489 --> 00:50:34.990]  I mean, they can't be part of the contest, but they can at least be on the site.
[00:50:35.530 --> 00:50:36.410]  Who is Ron Paul?
[00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.830]  Let me see, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41.
[00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:40.691]  There's got to be a hundred of these!
[00:51:01.817 --> 00:51:03.218]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.238 --> 00:51:05.359]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:10.302]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:10.322 --> 00:51:13.144]  It's known as the Builderberg Group.
[00:51:13.765 --> 00:51:15.986]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.576 --> 00:51:19.019]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:27.070]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.097 --> 00:51:35.080]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:39.022]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.422 --> 00:51:41.923]  Bill Burgess makes great progress in order world government.
[00:51:41.983 --> 00:51:43.124]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.144 --> 00:51:43.924]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.944 --> 00:51:45.005]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.205 --> 00:51:45.965]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:47.046]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.571]  Endgame.
[00:51:56.811 --> 00:51:58.452]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:58.832 --> 00:52:00.052]  You have been warned.
[00:52:02.653 --> 00:52:07.154]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.494 --> 00:52:11.575]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:11.875 --> 00:52:12.435]  We listened.
[00:52:12.736 --> 00:52:17.737]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:17.997 --> 00:52:18.477]  We listened.
[00:52:18.857 --> 00:52:21.900]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.321 --> 00:52:22.861]  We listened.
[00:52:23.342 --> 00:52:27.405]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:27.786 --> 00:52:28.266]  We listened.
[00:52:28.607 --> 00:52:33.852]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.272 --> 00:52:35.613]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:35.994 --> 00:52:43.321]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:52:43.761 --> 00:52:46.403]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.

[00:52:47.484 --> 00:52:47.724]  That's 888-03-4438.

[00:52:49.426 --> 00:52:50.386]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:52:59.864 --> 00:53:03.126]  Spyville.com is your choice for everything spy related.
[00:53:03.206 --> 00:53:11.792]  Stealth cameras cleverly disguised as items commonly found around the home, night vision cameras, covert phone and voice recorders, powerful binoculars, security systems and more.
[00:53:11.872 --> 00:53:18.537]  Find hidden cameras wherever you go with a small handheld spy finder and locate hidden transmitters with one of our bug detectors.
[00:53:18.617 --> 00:53:22.159]  Spyville.com also carries a wide variety of night vision scopes allowing
[00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:22.759]  I don't think so.
[00:53:41.346 --> 00:53:44.068]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:44.088 --> 00:53:46.230]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:11.702 --> 00:54:17.105]  Some of the best entries we've got, we're not playing on radio because they're mainly text.
[00:54:17.745 --> 00:54:19.866]  And so they're not good for this medium.
[00:54:22.447 --> 00:54:26.489]  Again, by the night of tomorrow, I'm a little late on this because there's just, there's got to be over a hundred here.
[00:54:26.509 --> 00:54:27.630]  I was counting them up during the break.
[00:54:29.031 --> 00:54:33.013]  Entries, and I'm just trying to judge these properly, and there's four different places I'm judging.
[00:54:33.713 --> 00:54:37.855]  But let's go ahead and go to Excellence and Virtues, the name of this one.
[00:54:47.241 --> 00:54:51.284]  My viewpoint is to strive for excellence and virtue.
[00:54:51.324 --> 00:54:56.769]  When government takes over the role of trying to make us excellent and virtuous, they can't do it.
[00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:58.490]  They do it at the expense of liberty.
[00:54:58.790 --> 00:55:12.141]  So if we truly want a society moving in the direction of striving for excellence and virtue, you have to come down on the side of liberty, and on the side of the Constitution, and on the side of the American traditions.
[00:55:26.581 --> 00:55:28.161]  Here's Once in a Lifetime.
[00:55:33.744 --> 00:55:39.586]  There is absolutely no reason ever to give up any personal liberty to be safe.
[00:55:41.807 --> 00:55:46.589]  We can solve our problems merely by obeying the law and reading the Constitution.
[00:55:49.113 --> 00:55:53.776]  We need a foreign policy of non-intervention which will prevent the wars from breaking out.
[00:55:56.117 --> 00:56:02.921]  If I am to be your president, I will never abuse executive orders and never use signing statements to change the law.
[00:56:06.564 --> 00:56:15.149]  If we have a free society and recognize the position that we have a right to our liberty and we have a right to pursue our happiness, it means but one thing about our tax system.
[00:56:15.469 --> 00:56:18.811]  We will have no income tax and repeal the Sixteenth Amendment.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:29.210]  The spirit of liberty is alive and well in this country.
[00:56:30.372 --> 00:56:33.956]  Once in a lifetime I will tell you is in the running for first place, the one you just heard.
[00:56:34.657 --> 00:56:35.939]  Who is Ron Paul?
[00:56:36.619 --> 00:56:37.681]  Who is Ron Paul?
[00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.089]  I'm Ron Paul.
[00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:42.050]  I'm a congressman from Texas, serving in my 10th term.
[00:56:42.551 --> 00:56:44.452]  I am the champion of the Constitution.
[00:56:44.832 --> 00:56:46.933]  He's not just another politician.
[00:56:46.953 --> 00:56:52.917]  Ron Paul is the presidential candidate the mainstream media doesn't want you to know about.
[00:56:53.157 --> 00:56:58.060]  As president, Ron Paul will bring our troops home from Iraq, let Americans
[00:57:01.741 --> 00:57:04.142]  Stop the central bankers inflation tax.
[00:57:04.522 --> 00:57:08.023]  Stop unconstitutional spending leading us to bankruptcy.
[00:57:08.263 --> 00:57:13.444]  Stop the financial dependency on China, Saudi Arabia and other foreign governments.
[00:57:13.824 --> 00:57:16.845]  Ron Paul will end the war on drugs.
[00:57:17.225 --> 00:57:18.346]  That's a great radio ad.
[00:57:18.406 --> 00:57:19.626]  Let's go on a break with this one.
[00:57:19.646 --> 00:57:20.487]  This is Champion.
[00:57:42.509 --> 00:57:43.270]  I'm Ron Paul.
[00:57:43.350 --> 00:57:45.212]  I am the champion of the Constitution.
[00:57:45.572 --> 00:57:48.115]  The structure problem in this country is very, very serious.
[00:57:48.355 --> 00:57:51.398]  We as Americans are taxed to blow up the bridges overseas.
[00:57:51.738 --> 00:57:54.361]  We're taxed to go over and rebuild the bridges overseas.
[00:57:54.481 --> 00:57:59.726]  We just need to get the government out of our lives and off our back and out of our wallet.
[00:58:00.166 --> 00:58:01.447]  I'd like to get rid of the IRS.
[00:58:01.508 --> 00:58:02.989]  I want to get rid of the income tax.
[00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:04.951]  I want to repeal the 16th Amendment.
[00:58:05.431 --> 00:58:10.652]  This whole idea that we're supposed to sacrifice liberty for security, we were advised against that.
[00:58:10.952 --> 00:58:15.953]  Don't we remember that when you sacrifice liberty for security, you lose both?
[00:58:16.533 --> 00:58:22.714]  And going into Iraq and Afghanistan and threatening Iran is the worst thing we can do for our national security.
[00:58:22.854 --> 00:58:24.735]  The American people are less safe for this.
[00:58:25.055 --> 00:58:26.915]  It's the policy that is wrong.
[00:58:27.915 --> 00:58:30.736]  We should take our marching orders from our Constitution.
[00:58:32.586 --> 00:58:38.774]  His country is in a revolution, and I happen to be part of it.
[00:58:40.636 --> 00:58:42.097]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:42.118 --> 00:58:42.979]  Stay with us.
[00:58:43.179 --> 00:58:45.341]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:02.636 --> 00:59:03.456]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.217 --> 00:59:05.118]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.778 --> 00:59:09.582]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.962 --> 00:59:14.026]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.257 --> 00:59:21.280]  We have had more than 80 submissions of the Ron Paul TV and Radio Ad Contest at TruthNews.us.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:24.202]  We'll continue playing some of these throughout the broadcast today.
[00:59:24.822 --> 00:59:32.107]  Larry Pratt joins us on this 13th of December 2007, coming up in the next segment with a lot of important news and information.
[00:59:32.607 --> 00:59:34.708]  Stand by for that.
[00:59:35.508 --> 00:59:37.650]  This is a submission just called Radio Ad.
[00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:38.110]  Here it is.
[00:59:39.853 --> 00:59:41.734]  What does the vote for Ron Paul mean?
[00:59:41.814 --> 00:59:43.375]  Non-interventional foreign policy.
[00:59:43.475 --> 00:59:47.377]  I'm suggesting very strongly that we should have a foreign policy of non-intervention.
[00:59:47.497 --> 00:59:48.557]  No nation building.
[00:59:48.617 --> 00:59:49.678]  Don't police the world.
[00:59:49.718 --> 00:59:55.621]  That is a conservative, it's a pro-American, it follows the founding fathers, and besides, it follows the Constitution.
[00:59:56.381 --> 01:00:01.742]  We live way beyond our means with a foreign policy we can't afford and an entitlement system that we have encouraged.
[01:00:01.842 --> 01:00:06.403]  We print money for it, the value of the money goes down, and poor people pay higher prices.
[01:00:06.463 --> 01:00:07.524]  That is a tax.
[01:00:07.584 --> 01:00:10.564]  We need to get rid of the inflation tax with sound money.
[01:00:11.544 --> 01:00:16.886]  This whole idea that we're supposed to sacrifice liberty for security, we were advised against that.
[01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:21.607]  Don't we remember that when you sacrifice liberty for security, you lose both?
[01:00:23.827 --> 01:00:27.568]  I see the immigration problem as a consequence of our welfare state.
[01:00:27.628 --> 01:00:35.391]  But the welfare we offer the people who come, they get free medical care, they get free education, they bankrupt our hospitals, and it should not be rewarded.
[01:00:35.471 --> 01:00:40.392]  Log on to RonPaul2008.com now to find out how you can become part of the revolution.
[01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:43.553]  Excellent radio ad, that's in the running.
[01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.574]  This is Freedom, Prosperity, Peace.
[01:00:48.115 --> 01:00:51.216]  Our campaign is all about freedom,
[01:00:52.463 --> 01:00:58.954]  I've noticed one thing about you, Mr. Paul.
[01:00:59.154 --> 01:01:05.625]  The people think you're a straight shooter, and you're not going to play politics as usual, and you'll be honest and sincere to them.
[01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:15.595]  Our national sovereignty is under threat.
[01:01:15.815 --> 01:01:23.898]  Republicans, they're Democrats, they're young people, they're independents, they're older people, anybody who craves change and was disenchanted with the candidates down in the league.
[01:01:24.099 --> 01:01:27.560]  I'm the one who called your office and said I would walk across Texas.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.081]  That's the president.
[01:01:29.101 --> 01:01:32.842]  That's what his supporters call it, his money bomb.
[01:01:32.922 --> 01:01:36.784]  Why don't we just open up the Constitution and read it?
[01:01:36.884 --> 01:01:39.685]  This country is in a revolution.
[01:01:39.845 --> 01:01:41.866]  They're sick and tired of what they're getting.
[01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:48.512]  This entry's called Ron Paul 3.
[01:01:48.612 --> 01:01:49.753]  Here it is.
[01:01:50.354 --> 01:01:53.677]  My first political memory was of Ronald Reagan when I was a small child.
[01:01:54.197 --> 01:01:59.742]  Back when I was taught that our country stood for the rule of law and limiting the power that government has over our lives.
[01:02:00.142 --> 01:02:04.065]  And that our rights and freedoms as Americans always came first.
[01:02:04.385 --> 01:02:15.935]  But as I grew up, became an adult, I'd seen the country I loved dismiss the rights and privacy of its citizens, devalue our dollar and destroy our savings, and expand the control of government into every area of our lives.
[01:02:16.872 --> 01:02:19.555]  So I stopped believing what had been taught about America.
[01:02:20.355 --> 01:02:38.613]  Until I learned about Congressman Ron Paul, who believes in ending the intrusion of government into our families and businesses, who believes in leading the world by example, not force, who's never voted to raise taxes or voted for an unbalanced budget, and who believes in never sacrificing our constitutional liberties for a politician's promise.
[01:02:39.053 --> 01:02:41.796]  And now that I'm considering the next generation of Americans,
[01:02:42.643 --> 01:02:44.605]  I knew it was time to start believing again.
[01:02:45.485 --> 01:02:46.526]  Restore the Republic.
[01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:48.207]  Vote Ron Paul for President.
[01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:50.088]  Paid for by Americans United for Freedom.
[01:02:51.149 --> 01:02:52.190]  That's a really good ad.
[01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:53.651]  It's more visual though.
[01:02:53.671 --> 01:02:57.174]  At the end, he cuts to his wife and his daughter.
[01:02:57.194 --> 01:02:58.675]  I believe it's a daughter.
[01:02:59.235 --> 01:03:01.076]  That's all up at truthnews.us.
[01:03:01.136 --> 01:03:03.678]  Links on presentplanet.com, infowars.com.
[01:03:03.959 --> 01:03:07.441]  We're going to write several articles about these entries today and post them on the sites.
[01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:11.264]  And the people that made these entries, created these audio and video,
[01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:18.187]  Productions for the Ron Paul 2008 campaign, the Scratch Ridge Effortless Contest.
[01:03:18.587 --> 01:03:19.868]  They deserve to have these seen.
[01:03:19.908 --> 01:03:20.949]  I want this to go viral.
[01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:28.896]  This is a key info salvo we're launching in the lead up to the Supernova Money Bomb coming up Sunday.
[01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:30.877]  Pilot to Bombardier.
[01:03:31.398 --> 01:03:32.739]  We're approaching the target.
[01:03:33.279 --> 01:03:33.800]  Prepare.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:35.081]  Focus.
[01:03:36.882 --> 01:03:38.964]  And hit the enemy hard in the info war.
[01:03:40.439 --> 01:03:51.121]  We'll defend the Second Amendment, our right to defend ourselves on the other side with the latest developments with Larry Pratt of Gun Owners America.
[01:03:53.922 --> 01:03:55.322]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.342 --> 01:03:57.463]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.163 --> 01:04:02.464]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:03.064 --> 01:04:05.844]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:04:05.884 --> 01:04:08.045]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.672 --> 01:04:11.114]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.855 --> 01:04:19.181]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.213 --> 01:04:27.176]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.657 --> 01:04:31.119]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.519 --> 01:04:34.041]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:34.081 --> 01:04:35.062]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.082 --> 01:04:35.962]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.982 --> 01:04:37.083]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.303 --> 01:04:37.723]  They're after power.
[01:04:37.763 --> 01:04:39.144]  That's what they're after usually.
[01:04:39.445 --> 01:04:43.988]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:55.714]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:55.874 --> 01:06:01.039]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:01.399 --> 01:06:06.684]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:07.124 --> 01:06:08.225]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:06:08.585 --> 01:06:17.667]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:19.528]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[01:07:04.474 --> 01:07:05.354]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.055 --> 01:07:09.877]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.217 --> 01:07:14.339]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:24.668 --> 01:07:32.304]  We are back live, 8 minutes, 35 seconds into this second hour of transmission.
[01:07:32.324 --> 01:07:34.368]  I'm very thankful for all our Eminem affiliates.
[01:07:35.410 --> 01:07:35.930]  Yes, we are.
[01:07:57.316 --> 01:08:00.077]  I've been playing some of the radio and TV ad entries.
[01:08:00.117 --> 01:08:01.077]  We had 80 of them.
[01:08:01.097 --> 01:08:04.158]  I actually counted them up at TruthNews.us.
[01:08:04.198 --> 01:08:06.819]  I'll be announcing either later this evening or tomorrow, the winner.
[01:08:07.519 --> 01:08:08.559]  There's four different winners.
[01:08:08.619 --> 01:08:10.580]  Three video winners and one radio winner.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:14.001]  And I'm just trying to judge this properly.
[01:08:14.521 --> 01:08:15.042]  We're good to go.
[01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:36.283]  Despite the fact that Europe, a year and a half ago, voted to not do that.
[01:08:36.303 --> 01:08:38.565]  You know, they claim it's the European Union that people can vote.
[01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.066]  They vote and say they don't want it.
[01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:41.768]  The bureaucrats just say, we're doing it.
[01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:43.990]  Same thing's happening here with the SPP.
[01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:44.891]  That's coming up later.
[01:08:44.911 --> 01:08:45.972]  It's very important.
[01:08:46.032 --> 01:08:49.396]  Also, DARPA and some of their big brother technology that we need to cover.
[01:08:50.151 --> 01:08:56.676]  A bunch of news on the Federal Reserve Front and what's happening with the subprime mortgages and derivatives.
[01:08:57.056 --> 01:08:58.737]  That's now fleshing out.
[01:08:58.757 --> 01:09:05.982]  We're getting to see more of the direction that's going, and it's not going in a good direction, I can tell you, but at least we can be aware of it and deal with it.
[01:09:06.463 --> 01:09:10.706]  Also some good news, it looks like they're backing off more on attacking Iran, at least on the surface.
[01:09:11.186 --> 01:09:12.827]  So that's some of what's coming up today.
[01:09:13.188 --> 01:09:16.350]  Now there are international, national, state, and local attacks
[01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:17.331]  We're good to go.
[01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:51.903]  Is that late last week there were shootings in Colorado at two different locations of the same megachurch.
[01:09:53.004 --> 01:10:04.751]  One at one of their pastoral training centers, one of their colleges, dorms, and the other at the church that, by the way, had the preacher Haggard who left in disgrace earlier this year.
[01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:15.022]  And this individual sent a letter saying, I'm going to kill you, I'm mad, you kicked me out of the seminary, and you're going to pay for it.
[01:10:16.223 --> 01:10:30.650]  And then he showed up, he came in with over a thousand rounds of ammo, postooned all over him, clips and boxes of ammo with two firearms, and within twenty seconds of entering the door, he'd already shot and killed two people and injured others.
[01:10:31.470 --> 01:10:32.351]  Now, this woman,
[01:10:34.258 --> 01:10:36.839]  Who was a armed security guard there.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.440]  They're smart.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.921]  There's no point in these malls and places having security guards.
[01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:42.182]  I mean, everybody's got cell phones now.
[01:10:42.202 --> 01:10:43.963]  We don't need them to walkie-talkie the police.
[01:10:43.983 --> 01:10:46.044]  You know, the cops show up ten minutes later.
[01:10:46.064 --> 01:10:46.744]  You can't blame them.
[01:10:46.764 --> 01:10:47.645]  I mean, they can't be everywhere.
[01:10:49.025 --> 01:10:51.166]  And they show up, and this happens.
[01:10:51.707 --> 01:10:54.348]  Now, it just happened to, what, yesterday at a bus stop.
[01:10:55.109 --> 01:10:57.911]  Six children were shot in gang-related activity.
[01:10:58.211 --> 01:11:02.153]  Are we going to have metal detectors and checkpoints at every bus stop, at every church?
[01:11:02.593 --> 01:11:03.274]  No, you can't.
[01:11:03.294 --> 01:11:06.796]  But the proposing metal detectors and airport-type security everywhere.
[01:11:06.916 --> 01:11:08.577]  Homeland Security did that three years ago.
[01:11:08.997 --> 01:11:10.158]  This is the world we're entering.
[01:11:10.178 --> 01:11:14.800]  The borders are open, but every street corner has metal detectors and face-scanning cameras.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.582]  IBM's announced New York's going to be under their surveillance.
[01:11:17.802 --> 01:11:21.324]  They just sold it to Beijing, scanning your face, tracking you everywhere.
[01:11:21.624 --> 01:11:23.145]  I mean, this is Big Brother on steroids.
[01:11:25.359 --> 01:11:30.621]  The interesting thing, though, a couple days after the shooting, I kept reading and it kept... because they wouldn't say how he got stopped.
[01:11:31.061 --> 01:11:32.961]  And normally the cops will say right away what happened.
[01:11:32.981 --> 01:11:34.522]  Within hours, they'll tell you what happened.
[01:11:34.702 --> 01:11:35.742]  They'll tell you what developed.
[01:11:37.703 --> 01:11:38.563]  That didn't happen here.
[01:11:38.603 --> 01:11:39.843]  And I said, that's suspicious.
[01:11:40.144 --> 01:11:41.904]  And I sat on air last Sunday.
[01:11:41.944 --> 01:11:44.145]  I said, I bet somebody shot this guy.
[01:11:45.445 --> 01:11:50.767]  And I said, I don't know why they're not announcing why, you know, a day later, how this happened.
[01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:53.328]  He went in here with all this stuff and only killed two people.
[01:11:53.728 --> 01:11:54.468]  That doesn't sound right.
[01:11:56.924 --> 01:11:58.745]  And then I started reading headlines.
[01:11:58.965 --> 01:12:00.786]  I've got one here, ABC News.
[01:12:01.206 --> 01:12:05.988]  You read it, and it says, Security Guard, God guided me and protected me.
[01:12:06.708 --> 01:12:16.872]  It says that she believes God gave her the strength to confront Murray, the shooter, keeping her calm and focused, even though he appeared to be twice her size and more heavily armed.
[01:12:17.912 --> 01:12:19.213]  So I said, oh, it must be armed.
[01:12:19.233 --> 01:12:20.553]  I read like five other stories.
[01:12:20.993 --> 01:12:22.534]  Never said she had a gun.
[01:12:22.814 --> 01:12:23.854]  See, they're leaving that out.
[01:12:23.914 --> 01:12:25.295]  That's not the message they want.
[01:12:26.129 --> 01:12:27.970]  That's not the image they want.
[01:12:28.810 --> 01:12:29.751]  And this happens all the time.
[01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:33.252]  People defend their homes, their hearths, their businesses from these killers.
[01:12:33.272 --> 01:12:39.375]  In fact, they've had famous cases where they try to start shooting people and somebody pulls a gun who's a concealed carrier.
[01:12:39.395 --> 01:12:41.355]  The principal goes out and gets their gun and runs them off.
[01:12:42.816 --> 01:12:48.018]  So all these articles wouldn't say how she did it until the Denver Post told the truth days after.
[01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:52.420]  Guards' hands didn't even shake as she shot gunmen.
[01:12:53.030 --> 01:13:00.636]  She went, got in a prone position, took him down, and killed the 24-year-old Matthew Murray, who had said in a letter he was hell-bent on killing a bunch of people.
[01:13:01.217 --> 01:13:02.538]  He said he planned to kill a hundred.
[01:13:03.659 --> 01:13:04.800]  Going to Larry Pratt.
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:06.842]  Larry, this is some spin, isn't it?
[01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:14.288]  It is spin indeed, and in fact, what you would have had to look very carefully to find,
[01:13:14.953 --> 01:13:41.413]  is that uh... this security guard is a volunteer she's a member of the church she's one of twelve on a team of volunteers who rotate between attending say the early service and then uh... milling around and being vigilant during the second service and then vice versa with the other part of the team and uh... they she had read in the paper about the
[01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:52.687]  A killing at the Youth with a Mission training facility up in Arvada earlier, well 12 hours earlier at the point of the murder down in Colorado Springs.
[01:13:53.107 --> 01:14:01.873]  She read it early in the morning and so that just gave her a tip that we've got to make sure that the team is alert and stationed as it were.
[01:14:02.395 --> 01:14:08.678]  Well, it seems to me this is only common sense, and this is what churches everywhere should be doing.
[01:14:09.379 --> 01:14:19.423]  Not that those would be the only people harmed at the church, but that there would be... And by the way, in the Revolutionary War days, right through the 1850s, everybody brought their guns to church, no one would ever think about coming in there.
[01:14:19.804 --> 01:14:26.607]  In fact, in Massachusetts Bay Colony, you would be fined if you were the head of household and came to church without your gun.
[01:14:27.447 --> 01:14:30.449]  They didn't want the responsibility of taking care of them.
[01:14:30.914 --> 01:14:33.655]  of the mess that you might bring upon your own family.
[01:14:34.615 --> 01:14:43.457]  Yes, we had this clearly in mind at one time because then at least they knew they were facing danger, be it from a wild animal or a wild man.
[01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:51.218]  But now I guess we've assumed that somehow with our educational system we don't really face danger anymore.
[01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:52.258]  Well, hello!
[01:14:53.519 --> 01:14:59.240]  So what a contrast between the mall shootings, between school shootings, Virginia Tech,
[01:15:00.270 --> 01:15:03.452]  Uh, and the church at Colorado Springs.
[01:15:03.792 --> 01:15:04.732]  The New Life Church.
[01:15:04.773 --> 01:15:05.473]  He might have killed 50, 100.
[01:15:05.773 --> 01:15:08.114]  They'd be talking about gun control right now.
[01:15:08.314 --> 01:15:10.215]  As it is, guns save the day.
[01:15:10.635 --> 01:15:11.616]  Guns save the day.
[01:15:11.696 --> 01:15:15.878]  This guy with a thousand rounds, ultimately they found that he had three guns.
[01:15:16.463 --> 01:15:16.703]  Well, I
[01:15:35.154 --> 01:15:35.774]  It's probably 9mm.
[01:15:35.895 --> 01:15:40.257]  Yeah, she should have had a .357 Super or .40.
[01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:46.261]  .45 would be my preference, but hey, the 9mm is better than hands and feet.
[01:15:47.362 --> 01:15:47.942]  What can I say?
[01:15:48.583 --> 01:15:54.567]  A friend of mine, Charlton Thicke, was in church, a lot like this one, probably a mega church.
[01:15:54.687 --> 01:16:01.191]  There was only a thousand people in attendance at night, and a couple of thugs jumped in on the stage.
[01:16:03.197 --> 01:16:10.183]  I mean, we've heard that the Colorado shooter was using a, quote, assault weapon.
[01:16:10.203 --> 01:16:16.427]  Nobody's, to my knowledge, ever put in the papers yet what kind of rifle it actually was.
[01:16:16.988 --> 01:16:18.469]  It might have been painted black and that
[01:16:18.968 --> 01:16:19.228]  I don't
[01:16:40.489 --> 01:16:46.275]  Well, the key is just train yourself if that ever happens.
[01:16:46.295 --> 01:16:50.478]  Be calm, aim, center of mass, open fire.
[01:16:51.839 --> 01:16:54.101]  Well, first of all, be praying the way this woman was.
[01:16:54.702 --> 01:17:01.848]  It was almost like the film The Patriot, if you recall that scene where the guy was saying, Lord, make me fast and make me accurate.
[01:17:02.249 --> 01:17:05.051]  Well, she was praying, Holy Spirit, guide me.
[01:17:06.212 --> 01:17:06.993]  Well, he did.
[01:17:07.553 --> 01:17:10.434]  And she took the element of surprise.
[01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:17.115]  By the way, one of the relatively unsung heroes is a Vietnam vet who did the same thing the guard did.
[01:17:17.915 --> 01:17:20.856]  Ran to the sound of the shots while everybody else was running the other way.
[01:17:21.736 --> 01:17:28.757]  The Vietnam vet came from another direction, saw the shooter, tried to get his attention, and called him a coward.
[01:17:28.897 --> 01:17:30.858]  That didn't work, so he called him an expletive.
[01:17:31.138 --> 01:17:36.919]  That got his attention, and a round went by the pillar where this guy had ducked behind,
[01:17:37.546 --> 01:17:43.271]  Uh, and knocked off some splinters from the pillar and slightly wounded the guy's arm that way.
[01:17:44.572 --> 01:17:55.160]  But that distraction then enabled this lady, Jean Awesome, to get out from behind her cover, and she moved on to this guy, even as he started shooting at her.
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:58.663]  And she just kept walking, yelling at him to surrender, and firing.
[01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:02.161]  Well, isn't that interesting?
[01:18:02.181 --> 01:18:03.842]  If the men won't fight, the prophetess has to go out.
[01:18:03.862 --> 01:18:05.444]  Deborah did it in the Old Testament.
[01:18:16.681 --> 01:18:17.001]  I don't know.
[01:18:32.857 --> 01:18:35.860]  I guarantee you the anti-gunners were angry and went, oh!
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:37.241]  They would have just killed more!
[01:18:37.502 --> 01:18:37.682]  Yes!
[01:18:38.062 --> 01:18:42.346]  Because they believe an end justifies the means, and as Sarah Brady said, it's about enslaving.
[01:18:42.386 --> 01:18:45.389]  As she's admitted publicly, it's about making you her slave.
[01:18:45.609 --> 01:18:47.591]  That piece of wicked deviltry.
[01:18:47.851 --> 01:18:49.052]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt.
[01:18:49.072 --> 01:18:49.433]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.692 --> 01:18:56.013]  Ted Amos from Midas, December 13, 2007.
[01:18:56.394 --> 01:19:02.998]  Gold, 801.28 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $825.28, $406.75 per half, $203.38 per quarter.
[01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.599]  That's $825.28, $406.75, and $203.38.
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:10.562]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:19:10.883 --> 01:19:15.005]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:19:15.385 --> 01:19:19.288]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:19:20.015 --> 01:19:21.837]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:19:22.317 --> 01:19:24.018]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[01:19:24.278 --> 01:19:30.203]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:19:30.643 --> 01:19:37.309]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:19:37.649 --> 01:19:38.529]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:19:38.549 --> 01:19:38.850]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.734 --> 01:19:47.799]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:19:47.939 --> 01:19:48.339]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:48.359 --> 01:19:49.701]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:19:53.672 --> 01:19:57.915]  The holidays are here, and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[01:19:58.076 --> 01:20:00.658]  Why not make your New Year's resolutions even healthier?
[01:20:00.818 --> 01:20:05.561]  And the easiest and most delicious way to start is with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.
[01:20:05.581 --> 01:20:09.765]  The Excalibur Dehydrator makes eating healthy not only easy, but fun.
[01:20:09.885 --> 01:20:13.227]  You can use it with your favorite fruits, vegetables, fish, and meat.
[01:20:13.548 --> 01:20:19.232]  And the Excalibur Dehydrator cuts out the unnecessary salt, fat, and preservatives found in most grocery store foods.
[01:20:19.432 --> 01:20:22.695]  You can also use the Excalibur Dehydrator to make your own herbs.
[01:20:23.175 --> 01:20:23.975]  We're good to go!
[01:20:54.739 --> 01:21:04.392]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[01:21:04.452 --> 01:21:09.459]  The whole country's on a bus with a crazy driver that the passengers can't get hold of the wheel.
[01:21:09.819 --> 01:21:11.200]  We're all gonna go over the cliff.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.242]  The government's gonna know everybody's asses every minute of the day and night.
[01:21:39.599 --> 01:21:39.859]  We're good.
[01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:57.092]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:21:57.412 --> 01:22:00.196]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:22:00.477 --> 01:22:04.623]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:22:05.043 --> 01:22:05.844]  So what do you do?
[01:22:05.864 --> 01:22:10.772]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:22:11.252 --> 01:22:13.373]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:22:13.873 --> 01:22:14.733]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:22:15.154 --> 01:22:18.875]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:22:19.195 --> 01:22:28.559]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:22:28.599 --> 01:22:28.999]  government.
[01:22:29.219 --> 01:22:35.662]  Gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:22:36.002 --> 01:22:40.404]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:22:40.864 --> 01:22:42.625]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:22:42.645 --> 01:22:42.885]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:22:42.965 --> 01:22:44.406]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[01:22:57.934 --> 01:23:00.675]  Larry Pratt is our guest.
[01:23:00.775 --> 01:23:03.797]  I want to shift gears into legislative updates.
[01:23:03.817 --> 01:23:06.238]  What's happening with the Law of the Sea Treaty.
[01:23:21.713 --> 01:23:24.535]  What's happening with the NRA supporting all these gun control bills?
[01:23:25.475 --> 01:23:28.517]  Larry, please give us a legislative update.
[01:23:29.358 --> 01:23:32.780]  Well, happily, in a word, nothing.
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:34.240]  Nothing has moved.
[01:23:34.421 --> 01:23:43.946]  All the bad stuff that's been pushed, the Law of the Sea Treaty, the Schumer-McCarthy bill to Zapp, particularly veterans, that hasn't moved.
[01:23:45.407 --> 01:23:48.309]  The nomination of a really bad actor
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:55.082]  Michael Sullivan to be the director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Farms and Explosives hasn't moved.
[01:23:56.382 --> 01:24:03.044]  In fact, he's attracted more opposition than any of the other couple of items that I just mentioned.
[01:24:03.484 --> 01:24:12.627]  So we're hopeful that we're at least going to get through the rest of this session before they go out for the Christmas break.
[01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:17.548]  We don't think they're going to be able to move on any of these items, so we will have at least
[01:24:18.078 --> 01:24:29.149]  Made it through the end of the year, which is remarkable because we started this game when the clock was already at 99-1 against us, and to have fought them to a draw is...
[01:24:32.324 --> 01:24:40.788]  I'm very pleased that our members and the public that's found out about this have supported what we're trying to do so strongly.
[01:24:41.188 --> 01:24:46.810]  So another great victory, because just two weeks ago it was dire, and now you're saying it's stabilized somewhat.
[01:24:47.110 --> 01:25:00.896]  Am I accurate in saying from all of my research, which obviously you specialize in this, you know a hundred times what I do, that they are pulling out all the stops and making a conservative, a global move, not just here in the U.S., state, local, international, national?
[01:25:01.136 --> 01:25:04.918]  I mean, am I correct in saying, though, that they are definitely moving right now?
[01:25:05.558 --> 01:25:06.339]  They sure are.
[01:25:06.439 --> 01:25:23.587]  For example, in Switzerland, the Socialists and the Greenies, which is, I repeat myself, teamed up in their lower house to get a measure through that would deny the Swiss citizen the right to have ammunition in his home.
[01:25:24.088 --> 01:25:25.008]  Well, isn't that nice?
[01:25:25.028 --> 01:25:30.671]  You can have all the guns you want, even machine guns, which the men take home as part of their service in the army.
[01:25:31.418 --> 01:25:32.379]  I don't think so.
[01:25:45.555 --> 01:25:52.279]  There's a Switzerland that has been, really, better than we as far as gun rights, as far as an armed citizenry.
[01:25:52.459 --> 01:25:54.780]  Did I hear you right say that past, or they're introducing it?
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:11.990]  It has passed their lower house, and I don't know enough about their legislative... But they haven't been invaded in 300 years, and it's an armed camp, and they have the lowest crime rate of any industrialized nation, and you're telling me that the socialist scum of the New World Order has been able to... Oh, this is out... Is it going to pass their upper house?
[01:26:12.430 --> 01:26:13.351]  It very well could.
[01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:31.563]  The problem that I see that they're facing in Switzerland is they've had this desire to be part of Europe, to be part of it economically, and the European Union is saying, well, we're not going to let you do that unless you quote-unquote harmonize your gun control law, because they're blaming Switzerland.
[01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:33.685]  Well, when you say they want it, the Swiss people don't.
[01:26:33.705 --> 01:26:34.926]  The government won't let them vote on it.
[01:26:36.226 --> 01:26:39.729]  It hasn't been put to referendum, that's true, and I don't know whether this
[01:26:40.469 --> 01:26:44.711]  I haven't been able to find enough information on this to give you more of a report.
[01:26:44.751 --> 01:26:57.157]  This is something that happened just last week, and I've been so busy with what we've been working on here that I haven't been able to find out as much as I know you would like to know about it as well as I, but it's not a good sign.
[01:26:57.197 --> 01:27:00.739]  It's not been a good trend in Switzerland for some time.
[01:27:00.819 --> 01:27:09.183]  I went over there, golly, at least ten years ago, and even then I saw that the good guys had kind of
[01:27:11.076 --> 01:27:12.077]  Basically given up.
[01:27:12.177 --> 01:27:22.024]  They were, they quote-unquote knew that things were moving against them and they really didn't have a strategy for getting people's attention in the public.
[01:27:22.805 --> 01:27:28.549]  And the government also, I've studied some of the Swiss politics, has brought in what about 20% foreigners are now citizens.
[01:27:28.770 --> 01:27:31.652]  They're using them as a liaison block to shred the country.
[01:27:32.595 --> 01:27:38.978]  Yes, and that has caused, actually, a reaction among the Swiss people, and that could be turning around.
[01:27:39.018 --> 01:27:42.720]  It's probably stopped as far as the influx is concerned.
[01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:51.344]  But it's one thing to want to get rid of the foreigners, it's quite another thing to want to be able to defend yourself, and if they've given up on that, frankly,
[01:27:52.364 --> 01:28:00.686]  The rest, I don't think, makes much difference because ultimately they're not going to have any way for the people to enforce their sovereign will.
[01:28:00.886 --> 01:28:02.927]  And by the way, I'm not just making that up.
[01:28:02.967 --> 01:28:05.327]  I've looked at England, I've looked at Switzerland, I've looked at other places.
[01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:09.848]  France, predominantly the foreigners vote in the blocs against guns.
[01:28:10.109 --> 01:28:13.809]  They come from slave nations and then they want to enslave the nations they've come to.
[01:28:13.869 --> 01:28:15.090]  I wonder what's wrong with them, Larry?
[01:28:15.410 --> 01:28:19.871]  Well, it's particularly bad when, like in France, the foreigners are largely Muslim
[01:28:20.611 --> 01:28:22.673]  The Muslims don't mind having guns for themselves.
[01:28:22.693 --> 01:28:24.534]  They just don't want their subjects to have guns.
[01:28:25.775 --> 01:28:28.618]  We'll be right back with Larry Pratt on the other side.
[01:28:28.978 --> 01:28:30.439]  Folks, a New Year's resolution.
[01:28:30.819 --> 01:28:32.220]  Join Gun Owners of America.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:32.741]  Don't wait.
[01:28:32.821 --> 01:28:33.501]  Do it today.
[01:28:33.882 --> 01:28:35.383]  Gunowners.org.
[01:28:35.483 --> 01:28:36.123]  Get in there.
[01:28:36.904 --> 01:28:38.225]  Join Gun Owners today.
[01:28:38.245 --> 01:28:39.306]  We'll come back with more info.
[01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:45.030]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.491 --> 01:28:46.992]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.991 --> 01:28:50.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.906 --> 01:28:57.227]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:28:57.567 --> 01:29:04.489]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:29:04.849 --> 01:29:17.332]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:29:17.572 --> 01:29:20.233]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:29:20.553 --> 01:29:26.755]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:29:26.995 --> 01:29:32.137]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:29:32.377 --> 01:29:38.979]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:41.041]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:56.542]  Yes, there is an In-Dash AM-FM shortwave radio.
[01:29:56.823 --> 01:30:04.908]  For limited time and in limited numbers, the Sony GT-160S AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player is available only at the Power Hour.

[01:30:28.425 --> 01:30:30.646]  There's even an input to plug in an external source.
[01:30:30.887 --> 01:30:36.811]  Your MP3 player, your iPod, your DVD player, or any other source will sound great through your new Sony receiver.
[01:30:37.111 --> 01:30:40.072]  These radios are not available anywhere else and for a limited time.
[01:30:40.272 --> 01:30:40.952]  So call now.
[01:30:41.172 --> 01:30:41.412]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:30:41.432 --> 01:30:44.233]  That's 877-817-9829 and get your Sony GT-160S AM FM shortwave radio and CD player from the Power Hour.
[01:30:53.206 --> 01:30:57.470]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:30:57.730 --> 01:31:02.614]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:02.835 --> 01:31:04.156]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:04.336 --> 01:31:07.679]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:31:07.939 --> 01:31:13.104]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:31:13.364 --> 01:31:19.129]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Subcompany in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:31:19.449 --> 01:31:21.871]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:31:21.971 --> 01:31:24.293]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[01:31:24.493 --> 01:31:26.655]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:27.896]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:31:28.116 --> 01:31:29.057]  No animal testing.
[01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:30.618]  I use them and love them.
[01:31:30.638 --> 01:31:32.260]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:33.681]  And I save big time.
[01:31:33.961 --> 01:31:35.542]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:35.662 --> 01:31:35.983]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:36.003 --> 01:31:38.525]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:31:45.410 --> 01:31:51.935]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:31:53.736 --> 01:31:59.801]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.385 --> 01:32:11.270]  We got Larry with us for about 10 more minutes and I'm going to get into the EU expanding without the people's consent.
[01:32:11.994 --> 01:32:13.217]  We're gonna get into the economy.
[01:32:13.257 --> 01:32:14.881]  We're hoping the phone's up in the 30-hour.
[01:32:14.901 --> 01:32:18.449]  Play more of these Ron Paul ads from the TruthNews.us contest.
[01:32:19.850 --> 01:32:22.572]  Larry, look, I see the massive attack.
[01:32:23.073 --> 01:32:28.977]  We have Schwarzenegger getting this law passed to make them have micro-stamps on the bullets, the NRA pushing that.
[01:32:29.558 --> 01:32:38.325]  That'll make, you know, that'll cause universal adoption, just like car standards or water standards get adopted all over the country from California and New York, but mainly California.
[01:32:38.825 --> 01:32:39.926]  That's gonna hurt things.
[01:32:40.326 --> 01:32:43.088]  We've got lawsuits against gun manufacturers still going.
[01:32:43.108 --> 01:32:45.891]  We've got the BATF being radically expanded.
[01:32:46.271 --> 01:32:48.653]  We've got the NRA pushing all these gun control bills.
[01:32:49.614 --> 01:32:50.374]  Only Gun Owners.
[01:32:50.434 --> 01:32:52.336]  And again, you guys have gotten much, even stronger.
[01:32:52.396 --> 01:32:53.257]  You were already perfect.
[01:32:53.297 --> 01:32:54.198]  Now you're past that.
[01:32:54.718 --> 01:32:59.402]  You know, now finally speaking out against the NRA because they're our mortal enemy, pretty much.
[01:32:59.442 --> 01:33:00.523]  Not the members, folks.
[01:33:00.884 --> 01:33:05.087]  You need to go read the open letter to Gun Owners on GunOwners.org.
[01:33:05.167 --> 01:33:06.028]  GunOwners.org.
[01:33:06.348 --> 01:33:07.690]  But Larry, I'm going to say it right now.
[01:33:08.490 --> 01:33:12.394]  Just like I promote Ron Paul and raise him money, and just like I'm pushing what he's doing,
[01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:15.652]  There is no better organization than Gun Owners of America.
[01:33:15.672 --> 01:33:16.192]  You've got what?
[01:33:16.212 --> 01:33:18.213]  150-something thousand members.
[01:33:18.234 --> 01:33:19.354]  You've been double that before.
[01:33:19.374 --> 01:33:21.195]  You're the second largest gun group in the country.
[01:33:21.616 --> 01:33:24.538]  You've exposed Fred Thompson as his anti-gun votes.
[01:33:24.918 --> 01:33:30.281]  You're the only one that'll actually, you know, you work with JPFO, but as you said, they're more of a think tank.
[01:33:30.542 --> 01:33:32.363]  They're tiny, but great folks too.
[01:33:32.403 --> 01:33:33.063]  We support them.
[01:33:33.584 --> 01:33:39.047]  I want my listeners to get a yearly membership or go all the way if you've got the money and get a lifetime.
[01:33:39.127 --> 01:33:40.048]  Make the phone call.
[01:33:40.088 --> 01:33:40.888]  Go to the website.
[01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:41.409]  Larry,
[01:33:41.949 --> 01:33:44.172]  Put out the pitch for people to join you.
[01:33:44.452 --> 01:33:46.074]  You are a key brigade.
[01:33:46.094 --> 01:33:48.977]  If it wasn't for you guys, I'd be passing all this stuff.
[01:33:49.358 --> 01:33:50.138]  I am thankful.
[01:33:50.299 --> 01:33:51.420]  That's why we put the links up.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:52.461]  We promote what you're doing.
[01:33:53.182 --> 01:33:56.766]  You are a key cohort, a key brigade.
[01:33:56.766 --> 01:34:00.028]  Well, the easiest way is to go to our website, gunowners.org, which you've already spelled out.
[01:34:00.108 --> 01:34:02.430]  And that's also the place where, hopefully, they will go
[01:34:25.725 --> 01:34:29.789]  No matter how they join, because that's where the email alerts start.
[01:34:29.849 --> 01:34:32.091]  That's how they get a free subscription for goodness sakes.
[01:34:32.111 --> 01:34:33.693]  They don't even have to be a paid member.
[01:34:34.293 --> 01:34:41.540]  And it's those email battles that we fight that so often are the only way we have time to offer resistance.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.803]  I don't have to tell you how long it takes to get something into the mail.
[01:34:45.347 --> 01:34:50.091]  And the way some of these measures are snuck through, there's just no time.
[01:34:50.691 --> 01:34:56.596]  They announced the vote on the McCarthy bill against veterans at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[01:34:56.656 --> 01:34:58.418]  By 10 o'clock, they had the vote.
[01:34:58.898 --> 01:35:01.640]  Now, that even beat our ability to email.
[01:35:02.801 --> 01:35:04.303]  We just didn't have time on that one.
[01:35:04.323 --> 01:35:11.228]  But mostly, we might have a... Even if it's a day or two, you'll get an email from us, and you'll know what it is that you can do.
[01:35:11.568 --> 01:35:13.310]  Send an email, a phone number, whatever it might be.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:25.544]  In the mail, we fight other battles, because not all the battles are coming up so fast, and we would encourage people to, if they can't get on the internet, go to the phone and call us at 703-321-7000.
[01:35:28.799 --> 01:35:32.062]  85-85 and join right there.
[01:35:32.122 --> 01:35:35.286]  We'll send information out if they want to do it through the mail.
[01:35:35.346 --> 01:35:37.147]  So that's the way to do it.
[01:35:37.528 --> 01:35:43.794]  Larry, tell folks how much a yearly versus a lifetime is and give that number out several times because I want to make this clear.
[01:35:44.815 --> 01:35:45.636]  I have analyzed.
[01:35:46.357 --> 01:35:49.220]  I got into talk radio to defend the Second Amendment.
[01:35:49.320 --> 01:35:51.182]  I woke up because of that and Waco.
[01:35:52.808 --> 01:35:58.712]  And ladies and gentlemen, there has been one group nationally that has stopped 90 plus percent of it.
[01:35:58.732 --> 01:35:59.733]  Some of it got past them.
[01:36:01.034 --> 01:36:02.955]  The NRA is behind all of it.
[01:36:03.035 --> 01:36:04.076]  I know you can't believe that.
[01:36:04.116 --> 01:36:04.856]  You'd better learn.
[01:36:05.837 --> 01:36:07.058]  They are a Judas goat.
[01:36:07.418 --> 01:36:07.678]  Okay?
[01:36:07.738 --> 01:36:08.399]  Double agent.
[01:36:08.779 --> 01:36:11.721]  Not the members, but the leadership.
[01:36:12.542 --> 01:36:13.582]  There's one group.
[01:36:14.203 --> 01:36:15.824]  There's one group that keeps beating it.
[01:36:16.673 --> 01:36:23.736]  We need to support the one group who has been there, the only group we've got.
[01:36:23.816 --> 01:36:24.156]  Larry?
[01:36:27.118 --> 01:36:36.642]  It is hard for people to believe, but for instance in this battle over the Veterans Disarmament Act, Carol McCarthy said, my bill wouldn't have moved had it not been for the NRA.
[01:36:37.442 --> 01:36:43.745]  Charles Schumer said, oh you know it's got to be good when the NRA and Charles Schumer are working together on something.
[01:36:44.789 --> 01:36:50.073]  Well, it may be good from his point of view, folks, but it's not good for the rest of us.
[01:36:50.573 --> 01:36:56.717]  By the way, you're down there in Texas, and I'm going to be there toward the end of January, the 25th, 6th.
[01:36:57.097 --> 01:37:06.023]  There's a big conference in Tyler, Texas, and I'm going to be holding forth both Friday night and Saturday morning at that conference.
[01:37:07.631 --> 01:37:18.319]  I guess the easiest way to find out about it is to call the Falsters, or you can get a hold of them at sincerelysouthern.com and find out about this conference, but I'd love to see people in
[01:37:19.873 --> 01:37:26.877]  Well, let me just explain what, and we'll plug that again in a minute, Larry, what you do.
[01:37:27.337 --> 01:37:34.581]  You put out the alerts, you analyze within hours what's happening, sometimes that day stop it, or it passes the House suddenly, or the Senate.
[01:37:34.981 --> 01:37:38.203]  You're able to muster resistance in the few days you've got.
[01:37:38.223 --> 01:37:42.966]  Talk radio hosts all over the country, who are true conservatives and libertarians,
[01:37:43.798 --> 01:37:55.931]  Uh, they go and see the alerts, which are always very scholarly, and you've got a lot of experts there, and then you give us the intel to then get the word out and get the grassroots moving.
[01:37:56.491 --> 01:37:59.194]  Again, you are a key watchman on the wall.
[01:37:59.274 --> 01:38:00.315]  Give them that number to join.
[01:38:00.916 --> 01:38:01.697]  Well, the number is 703-321-7000.
[01:38:04.514 --> 01:38:09.276]  Eighty-five, eighty-five, and of course the website is gunowners.org.
[01:38:09.756 --> 01:38:15.138]  We hope people will go to that if they at all can, because that's where they get the most.
[01:38:15.238 --> 01:38:20.100]  It's twenty bucks a year to join, and it's only five hundred dollars a year for a
[01:38:20.965 --> 01:38:21.626]  We're good to go.
[01:38:45.415 --> 01:38:45.615]  85-85.
[01:38:45.635 --> 01:38:49.296]  Or gunowners.org.
[01:38:49.697 --> 01:38:50.137]  Sign up.
[01:38:50.177 --> 01:38:51.597]  Get your membership now.
[01:38:52.137 --> 01:38:55.498]  But even more importantly, watch those legislative updates.
[01:38:55.859 --> 01:39:02.060]  Larry, in the 5-6 minutes we've got left with you, I want to get back into this valiant lady taking down this killer.
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.421]  But before that, there's some other issues you wanted to discuss.
[01:39:05.662 --> 01:39:09.723]  Yeah, there hasn't been much attention given to the first ever
[01:39:10.898 --> 01:39:18.681]  The nominee for the directorship of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Education now has to be confirmed by the Senate.
[01:39:19.041 --> 01:39:23.643]  And the Senate Judiciary Committee has already approved Michael Sullivan.
[01:39:24.123 --> 01:39:27.645]  Michael Sullivan is a rather disreputable U.S.
[01:39:27.685 --> 01:39:30.346]  attorney from Boston, Massachusetts.
[01:39:30.406 --> 01:39:35.508]  He's a good friend of Ted Kennedy, who said after the committee approved his nomination,
[01:39:36.615 --> 01:39:40.936]  I look forward to working with you on gun control at the BATF.
[01:39:41.916 --> 01:39:58.419]  This is a guy who has been in that position for about a year and a half and under his watch the Bureau has just continued to get worse and worse and worse putting dealers out of business because some of their customers abbreviated the town or the county in which they lived.
[01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:04.920]  A lot of other things that just defy logic unless the purpose is to put
[01:40:05.345 --> 01:40:09.967]  Dealers and manufacturers out of business and individual gun owners in jail.
[01:40:10.727 --> 01:40:18.091]  It's almost as bad as it was under Jimmy Carter and I should know because I've been around that long to see what was going on.
[01:40:18.291 --> 01:40:24.273]  Let's be clear, they are white glove inspection for those that weren't in military school or weren't in the military.
[01:40:24.934 --> 01:40:27.175]  Larry, why don't you tell them what a white glove inspection is?
[01:40:27.395 --> 01:40:31.216]  Well, just a little bit of dust will show up in that white glove and you flunk.
[01:40:31.236 --> 01:40:32.397]  And what they look for
[01:40:33.081 --> 01:40:55.376]  is not criminal activity they look for gotcha stuff like abbreviating the city or the county of Twin Falls and some people live in both city and county so it becomes TF maybe they don't even put something in place for the county because well after all everybody knows if you live in the city of Twin Falls you're also in the county of Twin Falls
[01:40:56.673 --> 01:41:05.426]  The ATFE knows that that is criminal activity and they are right on top of it and they closed the dealer down in Twin Falls just for stuff like that.
[01:41:06.007 --> 01:41:08.030]  Well I'm getting the reports in every day.
[01:41:08.050 --> 01:41:10.634]  I mean I've never seen such an attack.
[01:41:11.269 --> 01:41:16.953]  That was a little kid during Carter, but I've never seen them being shot down, attacked, grabbed.
[01:41:16.973 --> 01:41:20.736]  I mean, it's as if the hounds of hell have been released, and this is all under Bush.
[01:41:21.096 --> 01:41:25.720]  It is under Bush, and it was especially bad under Gonzalez.
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:35.687]  We don't see any sign that it's going to change under the new Attorney General, and part of the problem is that the man directly in charge of the agency has been
[01:41:36.587 --> 01:41:37.508]  This guy, Sullivan.
[01:41:37.708 --> 01:41:46.955]  By the way, he's the acting director because the previous director, Mr. Truscott, had to leave because they found his arm too deep in the cookie jar.
[01:41:47.275 --> 01:41:50.758]  He was really taking money out of there like it belonged to him.
[01:41:50.778 --> 01:41:54.340]  He was having agents carry his bags when he traveled.
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:42:02.306]  He would have them go to his hotel room four hours ahead of his arrival just to make sure that it actually was warm enough or cool enough for him.
[01:42:02.854 --> 01:42:14.033]  He was putting up a fancy tile and paneling in his offices at the new bureau building in Washington, and they finally decided that he was too much of an embarrassment.
[01:42:14.074 --> 01:42:14.795]  They got rid of him.
[01:42:15.055 --> 01:42:16.498]  That's when they brought Sullivan down.
[01:42:17.031 --> 01:42:18.392]  But things haven't gotten any better.
[01:42:18.432 --> 01:42:20.053]  On the contrary, they've just gotten worse.
[01:42:20.073 --> 01:42:22.775]  Because Sullivan is a rogue prosecutor.
[01:42:23.155 --> 01:42:29.219]  He thinks that throwing people in jail for as many years as possible, regardless of anything, is the object of justice.
[01:42:29.759 --> 01:42:34.282]  And this guy is one of the worst of the worst in a federal system that's out of control.
[01:42:36.588 --> 01:42:37.529]  What do we do about him?
[01:42:37.589 --> 01:42:38.410]  How do we remove him?
[01:42:38.971 --> 01:42:42.816]  We've got to get to the Senators and say no.
[01:42:43.357 --> 01:42:53.890]  Happily, we've already got four Senators that have said that and they're demanding answers to very tough questions that I don't think Sullivan can answer adequately, which means his nomination
[01:42:54.612 --> 01:42:56.174]  If they hold tight, it's sunk.
[01:42:56.854 --> 01:43:01.219]  But as always in these battles, it's a numbers game as much as anything.
[01:43:01.619 --> 01:43:07.084]  We've got to have other Senators join Larry Craig and, oh golly, I just went into a fog.
[01:43:07.124 --> 01:43:08.766]  Well, we've got millions of listeners.
[01:43:08.966 --> 01:43:12.710]  They can go out and Google and fish around and dig up dirt on this guy, too.
[01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:15.132]  They can, and that would be very helpful.
[01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:17.094]  And then they can go to gunowners.org.
[01:43:17.134 --> 01:43:17.835]  We've still got a
[01:43:18.391 --> 01:43:21.132]  An alert up there on our page that they can use.
[01:43:21.552 --> 01:43:22.253]  Read through that.
[01:43:22.373 --> 01:43:27.995]  Send an alert that deals specifically with the Sullivan nomination for the Bureau Directorship.
[01:43:28.495 --> 01:43:34.478]  Send that off to their Senators, which would urge them to join in putting a hold on this guy's nomination.
[01:43:34.518 --> 01:43:41.001]  If we get enough of those holds, I think you'll realize you better pull in his horns, go back to Boston where Teddy Kennedy will take care of him.
[01:43:42.145 --> 01:43:43.326]  I'm tired of this trash.
[01:43:43.406 --> 01:43:49.570]  I mean, I've actually got the magazine where she was quoted as saying, we want to control the public.
[01:43:49.590 --> 01:43:50.551]  We've got to dominate them.
[01:43:50.811 --> 01:43:52.692]  We've got to have a socialist America to do that.
[01:43:52.732 --> 01:43:53.693]  We've got to take their guns.
[01:43:53.713 --> 01:43:56.175]  Sarah Brady, who by the way, has guns herself.
[01:43:57.496 --> 01:44:00.197]  I mean, these people openly want to rule over this.
[01:44:00.218 --> 01:44:06.322]  I mean, the gun control leaders, Larry, as you know, but I'd like you to elaborate on this, they know it's about control and domination.
[01:44:06.582 --> 01:44:09.564]  They just tell the public it's about, oh, those wicked guns are hurting the children.
[01:44:11.466 --> 01:44:18.075]  Yeah, we hear a lot about the children and look how these rules protected the children at Virginia Tech.
[01:44:18.916 --> 01:44:21.080]  What a difference it would have made had there been
[01:44:22.127 --> 01:44:36.415]  Well, there's a lot of adult students at Virginia Tech, and a lot of them we know have concealed carry permits, and yet they're told if they dare come on the campus with their firearm and get caught, they are out of school.
[01:44:36.735 --> 01:44:38.436]  And the same thing would happen to a professor.
[01:44:38.737 --> 01:44:46.541]  They'd be fired, just like that lady was told in Oregon who wanted to carry her concealed carry firearm onto her high school campus, where she taught.
[01:44:47.707 --> 01:44:48.408]  It's insane.
[01:44:48.428 --> 01:44:57.500]  They would rather we be disarmed because that seems to be easier to control indeed and there's less legal responsibility.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:03.748]  Apparently they're not worried about the legal responsibility of 30 people being mowed down in a mass killing.
[01:45:05.085 --> 01:45:10.869]  What is the thinking that can possibly come to such a conclusion that we're better off being disarmed?
[01:45:11.029 --> 01:45:16.833]  Well, I mean, how do you think this went down with at least five major publications not mentioning that she shot him?
[01:45:16.873 --> 01:45:22.217]  They just said, woman stops killer, and then they don't say... I mean, isn't that obvious to everyone out there?
[01:45:22.478 --> 01:45:23.618]  How do you think that went down?
[01:45:23.638 --> 01:45:29.123]  Or these little socialists at these magazines and newspapers and TV just, oh, guns are bad.
[01:45:29.143 --> 01:45:31.004]  I'm not going to say a gun saved the people.
[01:45:31.584 --> 01:45:34.405]  It's the same thing that happened at the Appalachian School of Law.
[01:45:34.685 --> 01:45:45.326]  Almost no newspaper at all, or any other media outlet, mentioned the fact that when a killer started his rampage, he was stopped by two armed students.
[01:45:45.847 --> 01:45:48.687]  Unhappily, they had to go all the way off campus, get their gun, and come back.
[01:45:48.767 --> 01:45:55.488]  Happily, it was a small enough campus they could do that while he was still engaged, and they were able to stop him.
[01:45:56.008 --> 01:46:00.269]  Almost nobody ever read about that, because, in fact, an Associated Press
[01:46:00.799 --> 01:46:09.444]  The editor explained why he had stopped that information from going through the article that had been written by the reporter that had worked the article up.
[01:46:09.885 --> 01:46:17.770]  He said, oh, when I realized that these young men had gone and gotten guns and introduced them into an already dangerous situation, I knew we couldn't present that to the public.
[01:46:19.931 --> 01:46:21.632]  So this shows the nanny state.
[01:46:22.032 --> 01:46:25.254]  And most of these AP writers and editors, they're literal nannies.
[01:46:25.875 --> 01:46:27.536]  I mean, they're not even New World Order.
[01:46:28.539 --> 01:46:31.001]  They were chosen by the globalists because of that.
[01:46:31.321 --> 01:46:37.065]  They literally think of a revolver as like something from the movie Aliens.
[01:46:37.485 --> 01:46:39.487]  It's going to spew and spit acid on them.
[01:46:40.087 --> 01:46:41.308]  And so it's the nanny state.
[01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:46.872]  I mean, it's newsworthy that if there's a mass shooting, two guys go out and get their guns and stop it.
[01:46:47.432 --> 01:46:48.593]  Or a principal does that.
[01:46:48.933 --> 01:46:51.375]  But they decide because, oh, guns are bad.
[01:46:51.415 --> 01:46:54.077]  It's best we lie by omission.
[01:46:54.117 --> 01:46:55.498]  I mean, see, there it is.
[01:46:55.938 --> 01:46:56.939]  And I've told this story.
[01:46:57.860 --> 01:46:59.613]  My dad has a college friend.
[01:47:00.655 --> 01:47:04.496]  Who I've known since I was a little kid, but, uh, you know, the evening before I was born.
[01:47:05.036 --> 01:47:05.717]  That part doesn't matter.
[01:47:05.737 --> 01:47:07.657]  The point is, that's why I know these type of people.
[01:47:08.217 --> 01:47:19.121]  And they were having a party at their house back when I was in college, at my parents' house, and I didn't live with my parents, but my guns were in my dad's gun safe, because I didn't have a gun safe in my apartment.
[01:47:19.721 --> 01:47:28.904]  So I go in there to get the .243 to shoot these little whitetail deer around here, and I'm going in there to get it, and I come walking out of their bedroom, through the front living room,
[01:47:30.049 --> 01:47:33.270]  And it's in a case, he goes, excuse me, what is that?
[01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:39.612]  And he literally leaned back like I had some 50-foot fire-breathing cobra.
[01:47:40.052 --> 01:47:41.912]  A communicable disease, no less.
[01:47:42.012 --> 01:47:52.875]  And I went and put it back, I went and put it back, and I actually got a revolver down out of the case, .357 Magda, my dad bought off a cop when he was, when I was like a year old, but the point is really pretty old, you know, old Swithin-Wesson.
[01:47:53.335 --> 01:47:55.156]  And I walk out and I said, listen,
[01:47:56.081 --> 01:47:57.382]  And I said, listen, I'm just going to unzip it.
[01:47:57.462 --> 01:47:57.922]  It's unloaded.
[01:47:57.942 --> 01:48:00.204]  He's like, no, please, please, please, please.
[01:48:00.364 --> 01:48:01.204]  And I was like, listen, it's OK.
[01:48:01.244 --> 01:48:02.405]  And I unzipped my dad.
[01:48:02.485 --> 01:48:02.965]  It's all right.
[01:48:03.006 --> 01:48:04.266]  The guy was almost having a heart attack.
[01:48:04.286 --> 01:48:05.967]  And I said, listen, you need to get over your fear.
[01:48:06.007 --> 01:48:06.688]  Look, there it is.
[01:48:06.708 --> 01:48:08.229]  See, it's revolvered, and it's not loaded.
[01:48:08.249 --> 01:48:09.290]  He's like, I understand.
[01:48:09.310 --> 01:48:10.130]  Just get it out of here.
[01:48:10.370 --> 01:48:10.710]  Just get it.
[01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:15.133]  But then when he sees a cop in a black uniform with a machine gun, he feels good.
[01:48:15.293 --> 01:48:16.554]  Oh, I love it.
[01:48:16.814 --> 01:48:18.095]  Because he's a professional.
[01:48:18.656 --> 01:48:24.920]  And that objection has been put into this whole discussion of Colorado, because 15 years ago,
[01:48:25.999 --> 01:48:26.760]  I don't know.
[01:48:40.209 --> 01:48:43.012]  She hasn't had any more training than the rest of us for a long time.
[01:48:43.412 --> 01:48:45.114]  She didn't need a whole lot of training.
[01:48:45.354 --> 01:48:49.258]  What she prayed for was, Holy Spirit, guide me.
[01:48:49.678 --> 01:48:58.006]  That was a whole lot more important than being a professional, because a lot of professionals apparently don't get much guidance and they make mistakes like anybody else.
[01:48:58.446 --> 01:49:04.870]  This lady did what needed to be done, and she's a citizen, she's a volunteer, just like the rest of us.
[01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:10.152]  And I almost hate to call her a guard because that implies, you know, rent-a-cop or something like that.
[01:49:10.172 --> 01:49:10.412]  Right.
[01:49:10.613 --> 01:49:12.474]  We've got to get the point across.
[01:49:12.674 --> 01:49:13.874]  This was one of us.
[01:49:14.235 --> 01:49:16.816]  Well, the Second Amendment is under attack on Never Before.
[01:49:17.708 --> 01:49:21.709]  GunOwners.org, GunOwners.org, get involved.
[01:49:21.929 --> 01:49:24.870]  Sign up for the free legislative alerts and updates.
[01:49:24.930 --> 01:49:25.731]  Do it now.
[01:49:26.211 --> 01:49:27.791]  And be another watchman on the wall.
[01:49:27.911 --> 01:49:29.892]  Larry, fire that number out again one more time.
[01:49:29.912 --> 01:49:29.952]  703-321-8585.
[01:49:30.332 --> 01:49:30.592]  Again.
[01:49:36.818 --> 01:49:36.878]  703-321-8585.
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:41.961]  Larry Pratt, I want you to have a great Christmas.
[01:49:42.021 --> 01:49:46.884]  We'll talk to you early next year, and we'll plug that event you're going to be at in Texas.
[01:49:47.144 --> 01:49:48.925]  Oh, God bless you, and thanks so much.
[01:49:49.185 --> 01:49:49.826]  Thank you, Larry.
[01:49:54.108 --> 01:49:55.509]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:56.590 --> 01:49:59.291]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:50:00.152 --> 01:50:02.553]  Earth is dominated by our government.
[01:50:03.231 --> 01:50:05.433]  It's known as the Bilderberg Truth.
[01:50:06.053 --> 01:50:08.275]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:50:08.835 --> 01:50:11.277]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.017 --> 01:50:19.362]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.353 --> 01:50:27.336]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.817 --> 01:50:31.299]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.679 --> 01:50:34.181]  Bill Burdick's making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.241 --> 01:50:35.402]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.422 --> 01:50:36.122]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.142 --> 01:50:37.263]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.483 --> 01:50:38.204]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.224 --> 01:50:39.485]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:51:53.434 --> 01:51:53.834]  Attention!
[01:51:53.954 --> 01:51:56.755]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:51:57.055 --> 01:52:01.356]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:52:01.676 --> 01:52:02.356]  Listen closely.
[01:52:03.016 --> 01:52:10.498]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:52:10.758 --> 01:52:19.520]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:20.280]  Yeah.
[01:52:37.699 --> 01:52:38.219]  We're good to go.
[01:53:05.271 --> 01:53:08.695]  Don't call my name out your window.
[01:53:08.975 --> 01:53:10.056]  I'm leaving.
[01:53:11.277 --> 01:53:13.980]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:19.106]  Don't send your kin folks to give me no talking.
[01:53:19.206 --> 01:53:20.587]  I'll be gone.
[01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:22.549]  I'll be gone like I said.
[01:53:27.002 --> 01:53:34.844]  By the way, this just broke.
[01:53:35.004 --> 01:53:44.426]  Out of six articles I read, days after the lady took down the scum at the church, one article said she shot him.
[01:53:44.466 --> 01:53:47.107]  Denver Post, because he's a journalist, I mean that's 101.
[01:53:48.783 --> 01:53:50.684]  The eyewitnesses have now been talked to.
[01:53:50.724 --> 01:53:51.865]  It's in a bunch of other reports.
[01:53:52.345 --> 01:53:55.247]  As you heard, one guy, a Vietnam vet, was distracting him.
[01:53:55.707 --> 01:53:58.889]  She walked forward, was shooting at him, while he shot at her.
[01:53:59.670 --> 01:54:00.310]  And guess what?
[01:54:00.370 --> 01:54:03.732]  The police just came out and said the guy committed suicide.
[01:54:04.312 --> 01:54:05.373]  Now, number one, that's a lie.
[01:54:06.053 --> 01:54:11.837]  But the point here is, according to all the eyewitnesses, but the point here is, notice how the cops didn't want to say for days how he died.
[01:54:12.117 --> 01:54:18.401]  They were trying to spin this in anti-gun Colorado, where they're trying to suppress a pro-Second Amendment population.
[01:54:19.950 --> 01:54:20.630]  We're good to go.
[01:54:34.770 --> 01:54:37.632]  And then the police started saying yesterday, well maybe it was suicide.
[01:54:38.013 --> 01:54:39.033]  We gotta look at that.
[01:54:39.113 --> 01:54:47.160]  Now remember, they got coroners like Fannie Malick in Arkansas that'll say somebody shooting themselves twice in the back of the head, cutting their arms and legs off, is suicide.
[01:54:47.520 --> 01:54:50.902]  Folks, you can't shoot yourself in the head repeatedly and cut your own arms and legs off.
[01:54:52.384 --> 01:54:55.426]  Or, you know, cut your arms and legs off and pour gasoline on yourself and light it on fire.
[01:54:56.198 --> 01:55:05.780]  Or a cop they tortured to death who saw Oklahoma City being an inside job, you know, and they stabbed him 13 times, slit his wrist, shoot him twice in the back of the head, drag him all through a field, blood everywhere.
[01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:10.881]  You know, he calls his partner, I'm getting followed by two FBI guys, then he's found dead.
[01:55:11.221 --> 01:55:11.641]  Come on.
[01:55:12.301 --> 01:55:13.002]  It's the same thing.
[01:55:13.022 --> 01:55:22.163]  I mean, if I remember found with my arms and legs cut off and my head cut off, I forgot one of the cases the head was cut off, you can't cut your own head off and shoot yourself in the head and all this stuff.
[01:55:23.364 --> 01:55:24.604]  I mean, they think you're idiots.
[01:55:25.919 --> 01:55:34.625]  Kind of like the police said that Gary Webb, the San Jose Mercury News guy, who'd been vindicated and proved the CIA was shipping the drugs in, was writing another book about it.
[01:55:34.925 --> 01:55:42.230]  People saw, he'd just moved, but before that, people at his house, coming down off the back balcony in black uniforms, he'd said he'd been getting threats.
[01:55:43.330 --> 01:55:46.973]  He told Premier Ricky Ross that, who we interviewed here on air from in jail, the recording.
[01:55:47.933 --> 01:55:49.714]  And he shot himself twice in the head.
[01:55:50.255 --> 01:55:53.577]  First shot was from the side, blowing his lower mandible and jaw off.
[01:55:54.190 --> 01:55:58.995]  The only way the police are telling the truth is if this guy had been shot and he fell down and he threw a fit and blew his own head off.
[01:56:14.071 --> 01:56:15.272]  Now, that could have been it.
[01:56:15.773 --> 01:56:20.157]  But, uh, they're admitting that he was shot multiple times by her, but she still didn't stop him.
[01:56:20.437 --> 01:56:22.539]  No, citizens can't protect themselves.
[01:56:22.739 --> 01:56:24.400]  The government has a monopoly of force.
[01:56:24.621 --> 01:56:25.862]  We rule you cattle.
[01:56:26.202 --> 01:56:26.743]  Shut up!
[01:56:27.924 --> 01:56:28.544]  It's real simple.
[01:56:28.584 --> 01:56:31.727]  Black people, 100 years ago, 150 years ago, couldn't own guns.
[01:56:32.027 --> 01:56:33.569]  The first gun laws were against blacks.
[01:56:34.009 --> 01:56:34.489]  It's simple.
[01:56:34.570 --> 01:56:36.031]  Slaves don't own guns.
[01:56:36.211 --> 01:56:39.414]  And we're all slaves today, or at least the man thinks we are.
[01:56:40.848 --> 01:56:43.770]  Harold's son, Australia's biggest selling daily newspaper.
[01:56:44.110 --> 01:56:45.190]  Total garbage.
[01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:47.612]  Church shooting of Matthew Murray ruled suicide.
[01:56:47.652 --> 01:56:53.675]  The man who killed four people, I guess it's two more have died now, at a church and a missionary... Oh yeah, two at the church, two at the missionary.
[01:56:53.955 --> 01:56:56.876]  Training center in Colorado died of a self inflicted gunshot when police said yesterday.
[01:56:57.317 --> 01:57:02.939]  Matthew Murray, 24, was shot several times by a security officer at the New Life Church on Saturday, but his death was ruled a suicide.
[01:57:03.260 --> 01:57:05.941]  The El Paso County Coroner's Office concluded after an autopsy.
[01:57:06.940 --> 01:57:08.041]  Volunteer security guard.
[01:57:08.161 --> 01:57:10.583]  See, she's a citizen who's doing it, now she's a volunteer.
[01:57:10.984 --> 01:57:13.566]  Who shot Murray, at the end of the church head.
[01:57:14.667 --> 01:57:16.028]  Her hand was guided by God.
[01:57:16.068 --> 01:57:17.790]  The death of Matthew Murray has been ruled a suicide.
[01:57:20.472 --> 01:57:23.575]  It should be noted that he was struck multiple times with a security officer, which put him down.
[01:57:23.855 --> 01:57:25.477]  He didn't fire a single round, killing himself.
[01:57:26.037 --> 01:57:27.238]  I don't even believe any of that.
[01:57:27.258 --> 01:57:29.140]  You're a pack of lying trash!
[01:57:35.891 --> 01:57:37.434]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:58:02.202 --> 01:58:06.287]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.963 --> 01:58:13.328]  We are now back live into the third and final hour.
[01:58:13.428 --> 01:58:14.970]  Wide open phones in this hour.
[01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:18.834]  Got two or three Ron Paul ads that we've selected that I haven't played yet.
[01:58:18.854 --> 01:58:23.600]  I think we'll get a couple more out of the 80 that were submitted and play those coming up.
[01:58:24.651 --> 01:58:30.896]  As well, the TruthNews.us Ron Paul 2008 TV and Radio Ad Contest.
[01:58:30.956 --> 01:58:32.858]  I'll be announcing that later this afternoon or tomorrow.
[01:58:33.198 --> 01:58:40.124]  I just don't want to judge this wrong, because I'm just conflicted about it and trying to figure out who I want to vote for here.
[01:58:40.624 --> 01:58:47.850]  I got a bunch of other news here, but we haven't been taking your calls yet, so let's just go ahead and do that now.
[01:58:48.591 --> 01:58:50.312]  Josh in Texas, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:58:53.434 --> 01:58:54.035]  Yes, go ahead sir.
[01:58:54.810 --> 01:59:03.653]  Yeah, I went to a sneak preview screening last night, and there was just incredible security there, and I wanted to tell you a little bit about that, what I saw, what I thought about it.
[01:59:03.793 --> 01:59:04.334]  Where was this?
[01:59:05.574 --> 01:59:09.395]  I live in San Antonio, Texas, and it is the newest theater in town.
[01:59:09.455 --> 01:59:10.456]  It's called the Palladium.
[01:59:11.116 --> 01:59:13.577]  They built it in a big abandoned rock quarry.
[01:59:13.617 --> 01:59:14.177]  It's pretty nice.
[01:59:14.557 --> 01:59:18.879]  They got a bar upstairs and everything, but the movie was called Walk Hard, the Dewey Cox story.
[01:59:19.602 --> 01:59:24.526]  And it's not out in theaters yet, but through my job I get free passes to movies and stuff like that.
[01:59:24.546 --> 01:59:30.011]  Yeah, no, it's been selected by a bunch of screen actors, people, as the movie of the year.
[01:59:31.312 --> 01:59:33.694]  Oh, it's not even worth your time to go see it.
[01:59:33.954 --> 01:59:36.697]  What's the name of the movie again?
[01:59:36.737 --> 01:59:38.558]  Walk Hard, the Dewey Cox story.
[01:59:38.959 --> 01:59:39.859]  Yeah, okay, go ahead.
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:45.164]  It's a spoof of the Johnny Cash story with some of the Doors, you know, the Doors movie thrown in there.
[01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:51.261]  On the back of the free ticket it says, please be advised that all bags and or purses are subject to search.
[01:59:51.722 --> 01:59:55.142]  Absolutely no cameras or recording devices of any kind will be allowed in the theater.
[01:59:55.162 --> 01:59:59.504]  Yeah, they do that to make sure it isn't pirated because things keep getting out on the web before it's out.
[02:00:00.344 --> 02:00:04.165]  Right, and I think that's why the screenwriters are on strike right now.
[02:00:04.205 --> 02:00:09.246]  But anyway, I got there a few minutes before the movie was going to start and I showed up with a group of friends.
[02:00:09.993 --> 02:00:17.418]  And you kind of just walk in, and where they take the tickets, there was, you know, four, maybe five people, uh, in security uniforms standing back there.
[02:00:18.139 --> 02:00:24.263]  And, uh, they had us move off to the side, and, uh, they kind of lectured us, saying, you know, you cannot bring a cell phone in here at all.
[02:00:24.964 --> 02:00:28.586]  Uh, if your cell phone has a camera on it, we want you to give it to us now.
[02:00:28.646 --> 02:00:31.809]  We will bag it and tag it, and you can get it after the movie.
[02:00:32.229 --> 02:00:34.751]  And then, uh, they, they were all lined up on the inside.
[02:00:34.791 --> 02:00:39.294]  There was, there was probably between seven and ten, uh, security guards in the theater itself.
[02:00:39.995 --> 02:00:52.000]  And they were all lined up on the inside, and they kind of escorted you to seats and, you know, being a... Well, listen, normally the police state, you know, issues where they do this is to train you to be a slave, it's to prepare you for all this.
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:53.521]  The people doing it, of course, don't know that.
[02:00:54.081 --> 02:01:06.746]  In the case of this, the filmmakers sometimes are basically ruined by the fact that this stuff gets on the web beforehand, and so if you go to any big premiere weeks before something comes out, that is going to happen to you.
[02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:15.693]  Right, and if there wasn't any conditioning involved, it was from the guy who had the wand, and it was some kind of metal detector or something.
[02:01:16.053 --> 02:01:25.797]  I had my pocket knife from working there, and I was afraid he was going to take it away, but the thing just lit up and beeped, but it didn't catch my cell phone, which was on, and it didn't catch my pocket knife.
[02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:29.232]  You know, I don't really know that he was looking for anything.
[02:01:29.752 --> 02:01:31.553]  He may have just been wanting people to believe him.
[02:01:31.573 --> 02:01:39.018]  Believe me, sir, I've been in a few movies, and I know Hollywood, and I know what they do, and believe me, what happened there was standard fare.
[02:01:39.799 --> 02:01:42.981]  Because, you know, Star Wars ended up on the web a month before it was out.
[02:01:44.442 --> 02:01:48.525]  Star Wars Episode 3 and Star Wars Episode 2.
[02:01:49.631 --> 02:01:52.152]  What, Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, all that stuff.
[02:01:52.552 --> 02:01:58.553]  I mean, these things get out there, and that's why they were doing it, but that's why I don't like going to those things.
[02:01:59.554 --> 02:02:02.614]  But I just tell them that I don't have anything on me because I don't.
[02:02:03.635 --> 02:02:04.655]  But that's what they're looking for.
[02:02:04.735 --> 02:02:06.015]  Okay, thank you, Josh.
[02:02:06.055 --> 02:02:07.075]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:07.996 --> 02:02:10.756]  I'm glad you told us about that, though, because it might have been something else.
[02:02:12.817 --> 02:02:17.058]  Like, they had another shooting at a bus stop a few days ago, and shot six kids.
[02:02:17.828 --> 02:02:18.309]  What are you going to do?
[02:02:18.329 --> 02:02:19.910]  You're going to set up checkpoints at the bus stop?
[02:02:20.911 --> 02:02:24.194]  Well, IBM's selling face scanning systems to track everybody everywhere they go.
[02:02:24.234 --> 02:02:29.059]  That way, anytime you walk outside your house, you're being scanned, so if you shoot somebody, they'll know you did it.
[02:02:29.519 --> 02:02:33.483]  But that's total big brother, and the people running the system are so criminal, you can't trust them to do that.
[02:02:34.204 --> 02:02:34.524]  Okay?
[02:02:35.125 --> 02:02:36.246]  Mandy, Richard, others.
[02:02:36.266 --> 02:02:37.027]  Your call's straight ahead.
[02:02:37.047 --> 02:02:37.107]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:37.127 --> 02:02:37.968]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:46.283 --> 02:02:47.704]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:47.724 --> 02:02:49.826]  A New World Order.
[02:02:50.546 --> 02:02:54.789]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.409 --> 02:02:57.171]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:58.331 --> 02:03:00.513]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[02:03:01.033 --> 02:03:03.495]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.215 --> 02:03:11.561]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.562 --> 02:03:19.545]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.026 --> 02:03:23.488]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.888 --> 02:03:26.410]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:27.431]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.451 --> 02:03:28.371]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.391 --> 02:03:29.472]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.692 --> 02:03:30.413]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.653 --> 02:03:31.693]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:06:52.178 --> 02:06:55.080]  Okay, I'm going to ram through a bunch of your calls as fast as I can right now.
[02:06:55.580 --> 02:06:56.461]  Let's see if I can do it.
[02:06:56.781 --> 02:06:59.423]  Because I want to get into more EU news, more economic news.
[02:06:59.463 --> 02:07:05.486]  I got a six and a half minute compilation of what Ron Paul was able to squeeze in in the final Republican debate.
[02:07:05.766 --> 02:07:07.848]  The money bomb is rapidly approaching.
[02:07:08.308 --> 02:07:09.669]  Target rapidly approaching.
[02:07:09.969 --> 02:07:11.710]  Coming up this Sunday, and guess what?
[02:07:12.010 --> 02:07:13.851]  It's the good part about being on during the weekend.
[02:07:14.251 --> 02:07:15.572]  I'll be live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:07:17.572 --> 02:07:21.033]  Right here on the GCN Radio Network, an association with MS Communications.
[02:07:21.493 --> 02:07:27.594]  You can listen to me on stations like 590 KLBJ in Austin, all the way from Oklahoma down to Mexico.
[02:07:27.614 --> 02:07:34.175]  You can listen to me on fine stations like Z600 out there in the West.
[02:07:34.215 --> 02:07:38.136]  You can listen to me on stations like KCXL in Kansas City.
[02:07:38.476 --> 02:07:42.037]  The Sunshine Network, a group of three stations in upstate New York.
[02:07:42.517 --> 02:07:45.418]  We've got about 20 affiliates now.
[02:07:45.478 --> 02:07:46.438]  It's really grown.
[02:07:46.518 --> 02:07:46.978]  Memphis,
[02:07:47.708 --> 02:07:48.708]  And here it's in Memphis.
[02:07:49.989 --> 02:07:54.090]  Quite a few places picking up the broadcast on Sundays.
[02:07:54.810 --> 02:08:00.492]  And we are very, very thankful to all of those AM and FM stations that pick up the Sunday show.
[02:08:00.512 --> 02:08:09.335]  So during the money bomb, the money bomb would have been going for 14 hours when I get on air from 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:08:09.355 --> 02:08:09.635]  Central.
[02:08:10.826 --> 02:08:14.808]  And we're going to have continual Money Bomb coverage in your commentary.
[02:08:14.848 --> 02:08:17.209]  And Trevor Lyman, we're going to get Lyman back on tomorrow.
[02:08:17.249 --> 02:08:19.110]  The Blimp should be taking to the air.
[02:08:19.130 --> 02:08:20.911]  We'll have reports on the Ron Paul Blimp.
[02:08:21.251 --> 02:08:27.334]  Continual coverage right here at the GCN Radio Network and Allied Stations and affiliates out there.
[02:08:28.455 --> 02:08:31.056]  Randy in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:08:31.116 --> 02:08:31.436]  Go ahead.
[02:08:32.239 --> 02:08:34.441]  Alex, it's a pleasure, sir.
[02:08:35.302 --> 02:08:40.988]  Yeah, I've done a lot of acting and taken a lot of classes, and you can tell when someone's been fed a story.
[02:08:41.028 --> 02:08:49.036]  And that lady, she was shook up from shooting the guy, but her story came out so garbled when she was trying to describe it.
[02:08:49.056 --> 02:08:51.699]  She said she threw her weapon at him at one point.
[02:08:52.439 --> 02:08:59.785]  I really would like to find someone that could talk to her and say, who came up to you and told you what to say before you got on camera?
[02:09:00.626 --> 02:09:07.972]  Because you could see it, that she wasn't able to just say what a cop would say when they discharged her firearm.
[02:09:08.132 --> 02:09:16.681]  Yeah, I mean, an officer, especially if she was a former officer, would have said, well, I saw the subject doing this, because that's what they train cops to do, is tell the other cops what happened for reports.
[02:09:17.001 --> 02:09:26.231]  She would have said, I saw, I heard shooting and yelling, I was in this room, I made my way there, saw the subject, began firing, telling him to drop his weapon, he fell to the ground.
[02:09:26.591 --> 02:09:30.756]  Instead, she was like, well, exactly, you could tell she'd been told what to say.
[02:09:32.889 --> 02:09:40.912]  I've got an idea on how to attack these guys, Alex, you've probably gone through it before, but we need a Pat Fitzgerald to come after this media.
[02:09:43.293 --> 02:09:53.537]  Even if we change the regime here, we've got this media to deal with, and the Ron Paul thing is making it very clear how much they are coloring everything.
[02:09:54.197 --> 02:09:59.722]  And, uh, we've got to, if we could find some prosecution... Hey, I found, I found more than ten polls.
[02:09:59.802 --> 02:10:00.563]  I mean, more than that.
[02:10:00.583 --> 02:10:01.844]  I saw like four or five yesterday.
[02:10:01.864 --> 02:10:03.705]  Probably twenty polls.
[02:10:03.745 --> 02:10:04.606]  I haven't counted them up.
[02:10:04.946 --> 02:10:06.888]  Well, they just don't even include Ron Paul now.
[02:10:06.988 --> 02:10:08.569]  Of course he's losing in polls.
[02:10:08.789 --> 02:10:09.610]  They don't include him!
[02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:18.416]  Well, I'm a retired Austin firefighter, and I'm proud of what you're doing to find out the truth of what happened all the way back to 9-11 and before.
[02:10:19.156 --> 02:10:21.958]  And proud to be an Anderson Trojan too, pal.
[02:10:22.819 --> 02:10:26.382]  But let me tell you, keep up the good work.
[02:10:26.442 --> 02:10:28.223]  I'm spreading the word as best I can.
[02:10:28.263 --> 02:10:33.687]  I've never seen so much cognitive dissonance out of people that you can show them and say, look, I'm a fireman.
[02:10:33.727 --> 02:10:34.768]  I know what happened.
[02:10:35.228 --> 02:10:36.549]  And it doesn't happen like this.
[02:10:37.329 --> 02:10:58.335]  Well, I'll tell you, the first group that really would come up to me at gun shows, because back then in 2001, 2002 I'd go to the gun show every few months when it came to town, and on the street, and phone calls and letters from Austin firemen, because they'd been given training in how fires work, the first group, in New York by the way too,
[02:10:58.996 --> 02:11:02.061]  Who really saw that it was a lie is Fireman.
[02:11:02.882 --> 02:11:09.834]  Spend a minute or two explaining to people from your fire science training why the official story's got problems.
[02:11:10.487 --> 02:11:18.293]  Okay, the official story is that, first of all, they show cartoons to us instead of actual footage like your story shows us.
[02:11:18.893 --> 02:11:25.378]  The second thing that everybody doesn't realize, or a lot of people go, well who told you that steel melted at 3,000 degrees?
[02:11:25.418 --> 02:11:27.300]  Pal, I knew it in 1980 when I was in cadet class.
[02:11:30.502 --> 02:11:36.485]  And there is nothing in a building and nothing in a plane that will burn over 1,800 degrees, maybe 2,000.
[02:11:36.945 --> 02:11:41.747]  But you cannot make molten steel out of anything in those buildings.
[02:11:41.767 --> 02:11:43.127]  That's why they're made of steel.
[02:11:43.828 --> 02:11:46.008]  And then the collapse.
[02:11:46.349 --> 02:11:47.189]  We have whole
[02:11:47.924 --> 02:11:50.488]  Textbooks on the signs of building collapse.
[02:11:50.889 --> 02:11:53.293]  And those buildings do give you signs of collapse.
[02:11:53.333 --> 02:11:55.977]  You wouldn't have had 350 firemen in those buildings.
[02:11:55.997 --> 02:11:57.299]  You would have had shagging.
[02:11:57.319 --> 02:11:58.501]  You would have had buckling.
[02:11:58.781 --> 02:12:00.244]  It certainly wouldn't have fallen free fall.
[02:12:00.863 --> 02:12:09.109]  No, and free fall speed, and having them fall at exactly the same rate, you know, they were hit in different places, and then Building 7, pal.
[02:12:09.149 --> 02:12:10.671]  There was something that messed up.
[02:12:10.711 --> 02:12:20.238]  They had, either a plane was supposed to have been sticking out of Building 7, or it was supposed to have been incinerated, and the fire wasn't going like it needed to, to drop that building.
[02:12:20.618 --> 02:12:23.920]  But that right there is what stopped me in my tracks.
[02:12:24.420 --> 02:12:31.424]  I told my kids to not get in the military, and I decided not to go over there at that point, and that's because of you, sir.
[02:12:33.185 --> 02:12:45.852]  But you're a firefighter, and engineers have gone public, and all the engineers, they get on the news saying, we're wrong, don't give any facts, and it turns out they're all on Defense Department pay, they're all getting government contracts, they've all been in intelligence.
[02:12:48.451 --> 02:12:49.731]  All of them need to go to jail.
[02:12:50.091 --> 02:12:57.293]  We need to find a way to hold them to their words, and the news media better be damn afraid of what happens when the truth comes out.
[02:12:57.853 --> 02:12:58.774]  Good job, Alex.
[02:12:58.814 --> 02:12:59.354]  Thank you, sir.
[02:12:59.394 --> 02:12:59.914]  God bless you.
[02:12:59.934 --> 02:13:00.954]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:01.614 --> 02:13:06.216]  I was in New York in 2004 for the RNC.
[02:13:06.236 --> 02:13:07.756]  Hard to believe that was four years ago now.
[02:13:08.836 --> 02:13:14.198]  It's all in martial law, and we had so many firemen come up and thank us and say, yeah, we heard the countdown.
[02:13:14.218 --> 02:13:15.198]  We were told there were bombs.
[02:13:15.238 --> 02:13:15.958]  Yeah, they blew it up.
[02:13:16.684 --> 02:13:17.885]  But they wouldn't come on camera.
[02:13:17.925 --> 02:13:20.647]  Now half the cops are trying to trip us, trying to start fights with us.
[02:13:20.687 --> 02:13:21.888]  Now most of the cops agree with us.
[02:13:22.268 --> 02:13:23.349]  They've woken up now too.
[02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:27.592]  But the firemen knew.
[02:13:28.833 --> 02:13:31.355]  And just to know they lied to the public.
[02:13:31.415 --> 02:13:32.776]  A public who can't find the U.S.
[02:13:32.836 --> 02:13:33.256]  on a map.
[02:13:33.536 --> 02:13:35.878]  A public that doesn't know which hemisphere they're in.
[02:13:36.338 --> 02:13:38.520]  A public that doesn't know where their state capitol is.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.903]  A public that has no basic understanding of how anything works.
[02:13:43.866 --> 02:13:45.886]  I mean, I'm not that smart, but I want to know things.
[02:13:45.966 --> 02:13:46.527]  It's interesting.
[02:13:46.587 --> 02:13:47.087]  It's fun.
[02:13:47.107 --> 02:13:48.487]  I want to read history books.
[02:13:48.547 --> 02:13:51.027]  I want to read historical documents.
[02:13:51.568 --> 02:13:52.728]  I want to study economics.
[02:13:52.828 --> 02:13:54.488]  I want to study science.
[02:13:54.528 --> 02:13:55.428]  I mean, this is interesting.
[02:13:56.749 --> 02:13:57.949]  Here's an example of science.
[02:13:58.129 --> 02:14:07.491]  Every day, I probably see five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, sometimes more, not even looking for it, articles about genetic engineering.
[02:14:09.631 --> 02:14:13.372]  Just five, six years ago, we were having debates about, will they ever clone humans?
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:22.923]  And I'd get on air and go, here's scientific reports from major universities and research firms where they cloned human embryos 10 years ago.
[02:14:23.723 --> 02:14:24.963]  That sounds like 16 years ago.
[02:14:25.803 --> 02:14:27.884]  Here's reports where they did this, where they did that.
[02:14:28.104 --> 02:14:31.385]  They're not publicizing how advanced it is.
[02:14:31.405 --> 02:14:32.385]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:14:33.606 --> 02:14:38.387]  They signed an executive order, started standardizing the driver's license for National ID Card 93.
[02:14:39.467 --> 02:14:40.708]  They had it totally in place by 2000.
[02:14:42.694 --> 02:14:46.778]  Americans think we have a national ID card next year because they told you now.
[02:14:47.939 --> 02:14:49.480]  But what's 93 to 2008?
[02:14:49.620 --> 02:14:56.947]  That is a long time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:56.967 --> 02:14:58.789]  That's like 16 years.
[02:15:02.772 --> 02:15:03.273]  Think about it.
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:10.102]  You've got a national ID card 16 years before you even know it.
[02:15:10.202 --> 02:15:13.603]  It's in place 8 years before you even know it.
[02:15:16.284 --> 02:15:22.806]  So, they've been industrially, at an industrial scale, cloning humans for years.
[02:15:24.186 --> 02:15:25.307]  But they keep them small.
[02:15:25.427 --> 02:15:27.087]  They don't grow them up to full size.
[02:15:27.387 --> 02:15:28.808]  They harvest them.
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:32.281]  I mean, they've got assembly line labs all over the world.
[02:15:32.561 --> 02:15:40.743]  They've been splicing humans, homo sapiens, sapiens, with chimpanzees, orangutans, rhesus monkeys.
[02:15:41.263 --> 02:15:51.027]  The medical reports come out, yeah, we got a monkey that's, we got an ape, that's monkeys and apes, that's 30% human, 50% human.
[02:15:51.547 --> 02:15:53.167]  These are abominable crimes.
[02:15:53.207 --> 02:15:55.708]  You don't show them on the news, but they put it in the Washington Post.
[02:15:56.534 --> 02:15:58.715]  I remember that in 2002, totally freaked me out.
[02:15:58.735 --> 02:16:02.017]  They said, oh yeah, we're splicing humans with other primates.
[02:16:04.359 --> 02:16:13.344]  You know, I was talking to some national writer just last week and I said, yeah, I mean, you know, who would know that in Hong Kong for seven years they've been selling monkeys that glow?
[02:16:16.046 --> 02:16:18.987]  And the guy kind of scoffed and I said, here, let's type glowing monkeys into Google.
[02:16:19.748 --> 02:16:21.549]  There it was, Forbes, AP, Reuters.
[02:16:23.024 --> 02:16:27.828]  Yeah, they surprise it with a jellyfish, and it's like the space bar scene or something from Star Wars.
[02:16:27.848 --> 02:16:28.969]  They're selling them in shops.
[02:16:29.609 --> 02:16:31.431]  Glowing blue monkeys.
[02:16:33.572 --> 02:16:34.393]  I've got a report.
[02:16:34.433 --> 02:16:36.915]  John, did I send you that report on... I said I blasted your calls.
[02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:37.535]  Of course I'm not.
[02:16:38.036 --> 02:16:48.384]  Did I send you that report about the mouse that's been genetically engineered, had its brain cells altered to where it isn't scared of a cat?
[02:16:50.313 --> 02:16:51.213]  It's on present planet.
[02:16:51.253 --> 02:16:51.774]  We go get it.
[02:16:51.794 --> 02:16:54.215]  It's in the science technology section at the bottom.
[02:16:55.855 --> 02:16:56.736]  Yeah, John's a trooper.
[02:16:58.696 --> 02:17:02.358]  Alright, I'm going to come back and I promise I'll go to your calls.
[02:17:02.398 --> 02:17:03.498]  The calls are all so good.
[02:17:03.959 --> 02:17:05.279]  They always get me off on tangents.
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:15.964]  But they went in and engineered just where the mouse doesn't have the olfactory connections to their pain centers.
[02:17:16.384 --> 02:17:17.564]  I mean, that's the control.
[02:17:17.584 --> 02:17:19.265]  Exact control.
[02:17:21.189 --> 02:17:22.470]  Precise control.
[02:17:24.451 --> 02:17:27.353]  And what do you think these vaccines to, quote, cure drugs used to?
[02:17:27.373 --> 02:17:29.694]  It goes in, does the same thing.
[02:17:30.034 --> 02:17:33.456]  They're able to genetically alter us, live time.
[02:17:34.577 --> 02:17:36.938]  Oh, but they don't have cures for cancer.
[02:17:37.499 --> 02:17:39.280]  No, they don't.
[02:17:40.020 --> 02:17:40.781]  Of course they do.
[02:17:41.041 --> 02:17:43.482]  And they're giving most of us that get it, the cancer.
[02:17:43.602 --> 02:17:44.503]  The pieces of trash.
[02:17:45.603 --> 02:17:48.245]  Ted Anderson from Midas, December 13, 2007.
[02:17:48.305 --> 02:17:54.911]  Gold, 801.28 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $825.28, $406.75 per half, $203.38 per quarter.
[02:17:54.951 --> 02:17:57.513]  That's $825.28, $406.75, and $203.38.
[02:17:57.793 --> 02:18:02.477]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[02:18:02.798 --> 02:18:06.921]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[02:18:07.302 --> 02:18:11.205]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[02:18:11.943 --> 02:18:13.765]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[02:18:14.225 --> 02:18:15.926]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:22.111]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[02:18:22.552 --> 02:18:29.237]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[02:18:29.557 --> 02:18:30.418]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[02:18:30.438 --> 02:18:30.819]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:36.644 --> 02:18:39.728]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[02:18:39.849 --> 02:18:40.169]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:40.229 --> 02:18:41.611]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[02:18:45.743 --> 02:18:47.424]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[02:18:47.684 --> 02:18:49.365]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[02:18:49.565 --> 02:18:53.586]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[02:18:53.786 --> 02:18:56.828]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[02:18:57.008 --> 02:19:00.829]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[02:19:00.990 --> 02:19:03.371]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[02:19:03.491 --> 02:19:06.752]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[02:19:06.852 --> 02:19:07.112]  I think so.
[02:19:22.665 --> 02:19:23.326]  We're good to go.
[02:19:45.991 --> 02:19:50.953]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:19:51.273 --> 02:20:01.037]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:20:01.377 --> 02:20:04.378]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:20:04.699 --> 02:20:08.120]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:20:08.460 --> 02:20:17.808]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:20:18.088 --> 02:20:21.571]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:20:21.811 --> 02:20:28.937]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:20:29.197 --> 02:20:30.558]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.

[02:20:45.211 --> 02:20:49.774]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:20:50.174 --> 02:20:53.115]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:20:53.436 --> 02:20:55.997]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:20:56.357 --> 02:21:01.180]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:06.923]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:21:07.243 --> 02:21:10.205]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[02:21:10.385 --> 02:21:10.946]  We're good to go.
[02:21:33.787 --> 02:21:33.888]  Yes.
[02:21:58.867 --> 02:22:17.924]  All alone in a lonesome highway East of Omaha To listen to the engine moaning and this one old song To think about the woman, the girl you knew the night before
[02:22:19.426 --> 02:22:24.170]  Mighty Mouse takes on Timmy Tom for a game of Cat and Mouse with a Difference.
[02:22:24.771 --> 02:22:29.555]  Instead of running away from his enemy, the little mouse heads straight for his feline foe.
[02:22:29.975 --> 02:22:36.400]  And that's because Japanese scientists have created a mutant mouse that isn't afraid of the big bad cat.
[02:22:37.141 --> 02:22:38.002]  Might be a cat.
[02:22:38.522 --> 02:22:43.124]  Because they're innately conditioned to express fear when they sense the odour of predators.
[02:22:43.865 --> 02:22:49.807]  So by getting rid of the specific receptors for sensing the odour, mice never feel afraid of cats.
[02:22:50.128 --> 02:22:54.670]  The idea is that if the mouse can't smell fear, there's nothing to be afraid of.
[02:22:56.911 --> 02:23:03.614]  Having removed the innate elements by which mice fear cats, we are able to make mice who can get along with cats.
[02:23:04.394 --> 02:23:11.836]  So by applying this theory to other mammals, we will probably be able to make other animals that are not afraid of their natural enemies.
[02:23:12.877 --> 02:23:17.898]  Experts have long believed that animals' fear is prompted by their acute sense of smell.
[02:23:18.498 --> 02:23:28.641]  But even this docile cat clearly smells a rat, and doesn't appear in too much of a hurry to strike up a close friendship with the over-familiar rodent just yet.
[02:23:29.142 --> 02:23:30.402]  Hayley Platt, Reuters.
[02:23:32.159 --> 02:23:33.540]  You see how advanced it is?
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:35.001]  That's just some university deal.
[02:23:35.561 --> 02:23:37.562]  They didn't know how to do that 30 years ago.
[02:23:37.622 --> 02:23:41.164]  They were growing human ears on the backs of mice.
[02:23:41.184 --> 02:23:42.125]  30 years ago!
[02:23:42.145 --> 02:23:43.846]  30 years ago!
[02:23:43.866 --> 02:23:47.108]  Actually, 28 years ago, I've seen the reports.
[02:23:47.608 --> 02:23:51.170]  They had cockroaches with microchip on top of its head wired in.
[02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:56.333]  15 years ago, they had the same cockroach design with a more advanced chip with micro cameras.
[02:23:58.129 --> 02:24:00.110]  They're already putting stuff in the food and water.
[02:24:00.131 --> 02:24:01.532]  They've been caught thousands of times.
[02:24:01.572 --> 02:24:02.953]  The advanced stuff's being put in.
[02:24:04.073 --> 02:24:05.034]  They're on power trips.
[02:24:05.074 --> 02:24:06.395]  It's all about having the power.
[02:24:06.435 --> 02:24:07.896]  It's all about having the control.
[02:24:08.376 --> 02:24:17.603]  And well-meaning Japanese researchers like this scientist develop this stuff, and the big banks and the big defense contractors pay for it all, and it's just sent upstairs with all the data.
[02:24:18.564 --> 02:24:25.889]  And the really sick scientists in their underground Level 4 labyrinths, this is admitted, are doing things off the charts evil.
[02:24:27.350 --> 02:24:33.512]  I mean, if they're publicly admitting they got half chimpanzee, half human creatures... Yeah, it's Washington Post.
[02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:37.313]  Can you imagine what they've really got?
[02:24:38.513 --> 02:24:44.115]  They've got bioweapons, ladies and gentlemen, that will kill 100% of the people they come in contact with.
[02:24:44.495 --> 02:24:49.896]  They've got bioweapons that will kill certain substratas of African bloodlines.
[02:24:50.437 --> 02:24:54.478]  Of Middle Eastern, Asiatic, uh, Anglo mixture bloodlines.
[02:24:54.538 --> 02:24:55.258]  That's what the...
[02:24:56.608 --> 02:24:58.809]  Arabs are an Anglo-Asian mix.
[02:24:59.750 --> 02:25:04.452]  A hybrid of the two subspecies of Asian and Anglo.
[02:25:06.173 --> 02:25:06.893]  Caucasoids.
[02:25:08.774 --> 02:25:13.176]  We sit here and we look at this and imagine the massive data they've amassed.
[02:25:13.216 --> 02:25:14.777]  I mean, I'm a pretty smart guy.
[02:25:14.797 --> 02:25:21.241]  I study this constantly and I can't even grasp one-tenth of it, deal with one-half of it, even talk about one-one-hundredth of it.
[02:25:21.921 --> 02:25:23.322]  The general public can't find the U.S.
[02:25:23.362 --> 02:25:23.642]  on a map.
[02:25:24.742 --> 02:25:26.083]  They don't know what the two branches of government are.
[02:25:27.228 --> 02:25:29.729]  The two parties are, separation of powers, the three branches of government.
[02:25:29.749 --> 02:25:31.510]  They don't know what the fourth estate is.
[02:25:31.530 --> 02:25:41.955]  They don't even have basic semantical words, semantical systems to contextually even understand what I'm saying now.
[02:25:42.755 --> 02:25:56.202]  But they know Brett Favre, you know, knows how to throw a football, and they know how to act cool at church and cool at work, and all I got to tell you is, you got high-tech scientists working for big inbred families who want total hegemonic domination and control,
[02:25:57.702 --> 02:26:00.224]  And that's why I've made Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:26:00.265 --> 02:26:00.905]  It's only Part 1.
[02:26:01.185 --> 02:26:02.326]  The people need to see Part 1.
[02:26:02.487 --> 02:26:05.369]  In another year or so, things are even still operating.
[02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:07.011]  We're in pretty serious straits.
[02:26:07.031 --> 02:26:07.431]  Who knows?
[02:26:07.451 --> 02:26:10.394]  Because I'm sworn to finish this other film first.
[02:26:11.575 --> 02:26:13.717]  That's not branching off into a JFK film.
[02:26:15.479 --> 02:26:17.100]  But I'll do Endgame 2.
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:18.722]  But in the meantime, we're going to write articles.
[02:26:18.742 --> 02:26:19.683]  We're going to break it down.
[02:26:20.003 --> 02:26:21.765]  We're going to state the basic facts.
[02:26:22.615 --> 02:26:32.044]  Of their master plan, this diabolical system, this technological terror that they have built, that they have constructed.
[02:26:32.064 --> 02:26:34.547]  Alright, I said I'd take calls.
[02:26:34.927 --> 02:26:35.868]  I'm going to confirm myself.

[02:26:41.514 --> 02:26:44.236]  We're going to break and come back and go to your calls.

[02:27:36.134 --> 02:27:37.074]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.535 --> 02:27:39.175]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.056 --> 02:27:42.757]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.272 --> 02:27:48.093]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:27:48.233 --> 02:27:53.415]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:27:53.595 --> 02:27:54.936]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:27:55.216 --> 02:28:03.379]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:28:03.599 --> 02:28:09.322]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:28:09.502 --> 02:28:11.283]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:28:11.344 --> 02:28:13.505]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:28:13.525 --> 02:28:17.889]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:28:18.069 --> 02:28:20.171]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:28:20.291 --> 02:28:28.117]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:28:28.237 --> 02:28:28.637]  We're good.
[02:28:45.689 --> 02:28:49.131]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[02:28:49.371 --> 02:28:51.493]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[02:28:51.633 --> 02:28:54.094]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[02:28:54.354 --> 02:28:58.717]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[02:28:58.757 --> 02:28:59.438]  Here's why.
[02:28:59.838 --> 02:29:05.781]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.

[02:32:22.085 --> 02:32:22.825]  I never knew this.
[02:32:22.945 --> 02:32:26.546]  I never knew that Dr. Breeding was the friends of the owners.
[02:32:27.822 --> 02:32:31.046]  I never knew that they were really good friends with George Humphrey.
[02:32:31.066 --> 02:32:32.567]  The other day he was in there and he said, are you going to plug that?
[02:32:32.607 --> 02:32:33.208]  That's my friends.
[02:32:33.709 --> 02:32:34.049]  I never knew.
[02:32:34.069 --> 02:32:35.491]  They tried to contact me three years ago.
[02:32:35.511 --> 02:32:36.412]  Applaused, a sponsor.
[02:32:36.432 --> 02:32:37.193]  I never called them back.
[02:32:37.273 --> 02:32:37.433]  Used to.
[02:32:37.453 --> 02:32:40.056]  We just didn't even respond to calls for sponsorship.
[02:32:41.045 --> 02:32:46.949]  I found out people didn't like the fact that I was taking sponsors, so I just said, well, I'll just go out and get a bunch, then we can actually hire more people and do a better job.
[02:32:47.189 --> 02:32:48.990]  So they also make what we're doing here possible.
[02:32:49.550 --> 02:32:50.711]  But their food are just great folks.
[02:32:50.791 --> 02:32:52.652]  ENERFOOD.COM, ENERFOOD.COM, or 1-866-762-9238.
[02:32:52.672 --> 02:32:52.752]  866-762-9238.
[02:32:52.772 --> 02:32:53.452]  Wonderful folks.

[02:32:56.154 --> 02:32:56.254]  Okay.
[02:32:56.294 --> 02:32:56.895]  Control myself.
[02:33:06.778 --> 02:33:08.578]  I love to warn people, there's so many facets.
[02:33:08.938 --> 02:33:13.499]  Richard in Texas, and Pete, Terry, Trevor, Patrick, and others.
[02:33:13.539 --> 02:33:15.440]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Pete.
[02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:16.360]  Or is it Richard?
[02:33:16.380 --> 02:33:16.860]  Who's up next?
[02:33:18.100 --> 02:33:18.861]  Richard in Texas.
[02:33:18.901 --> 02:33:19.461]  Go ahead, Richard.
[02:33:20.121 --> 02:33:21.001]  Hello, Alex.
[02:33:21.021 --> 02:33:21.721]  A couple of things.
[02:33:22.401 --> 02:33:25.722]  The last week PBS has had a couple of great things on.
[02:33:25.922 --> 02:33:35.244]  One was the resistance and the fight by the Gestapos for the Democratic Convention back in 1968, which showed tremendous spirit among the people.
[02:33:35.894 --> 02:33:46.417]  Last night I was watching the Johnny Cash Show, and they were showing what I consider to be one of the greatest songs of all time, and that is Why I Wear the Black.
[02:33:47.037 --> 02:33:59.681]  And what was just so inspiring was that at the end of that song, every person in that probably 5,000-person auditorium stood up and gave a standing ovation based on the lyrics of that song.
[02:34:00.197 --> 02:34:01.839]  And it just knocked me down.
[02:34:01.899 --> 02:34:09.445]  I cried for 10 minutes after that and just wishing that we could see the same spirit arise among the masses of people to support that sort of thing.
[02:34:10.546 --> 02:34:12.989]  Johnny was a great man and he's missed sorely.
[02:34:14.770 --> 02:34:24.399]  The other thing I want to comment on is yesterday there was a news story about guns and that sort of thing in Houston where we had that fella come out and shoot two
[02:34:25.317 --> 02:34:29.642]  Uh, illegal immigrants it turned out that were stealing stuff out of his house.
[02:34:29.702 --> 02:34:31.864]  Yeah, Mr. Horn, they were Colombian illegals.
[02:34:32.424 --> 02:34:35.387]  It looks like they're going to turn that into a racial incident.
[02:34:35.407 --> 02:34:40.452]  There's already been some sort of street action by, uh, with racial tones and that kind of thing.
[02:34:40.652 --> 02:34:46.558]  And, uh, you know, that looks like it could be something that, uh, will end up, uh, hurting our cause yet further.
[02:34:47.265 --> 02:34:50.987]  Well, Mr. Horn just couldn't take what he saw happening.
[02:34:51.007 --> 02:34:51.988]  We're going to be covering that more.
[02:34:52.008 --> 02:34:53.328]  I appreciate your call, Richard.
[02:34:53.809 --> 02:34:55.029]  Pete in British Columbia.
[02:34:55.069 --> 02:34:55.870]  Pete, you're on the air.
[02:34:58.231 --> 02:34:59.512]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[02:34:59.552 --> 02:35:00.352]  How are you today?
[02:35:00.452 --> 02:35:00.812]  Good, sir.
[02:35:00.852 --> 02:35:01.153]  Welcome.
[02:35:01.713 --> 02:35:04.034]  I want to tell you, I've been listening to your show for quite a while.
[02:35:04.094 --> 02:35:04.915]  I really enjoy it.
[02:35:05.435 --> 02:35:10.798]  If we could get back to random shootings and what stops them, there was a kid
[02:35:11.388 --> 02:35:12.289]  In a shopping center.
[02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:16.011]  There's been so many ensuring candidate shootings lately it's hard to keep track.
[02:35:16.051 --> 02:35:17.652]  It was what, about a week and a half ago?
[02:35:18.112 --> 02:35:25.157]  Some kid in a shopping center walked in with an assault rifle and a couple of banana clips taped back to back and started shooting the place up.
[02:35:25.217 --> 02:35:29.199]  Got off 38 rounds and killed two or three people and injured a bunch more.
[02:35:29.239 --> 02:35:29.860]  You remember the one?
[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:30.320]  Yes.
[02:35:31.261 --> 02:35:37.945]  I was wondering at the time what must have stopped him because the number of rounds they said he got off didn't sound like two clips worth to me.
[02:35:38.425 --> 02:35:40.827]  So I was wondering what must have stopped him and I was thinking
[02:35:41.337 --> 02:35:48.623]  What punk would walk into a place like that, into any shopping center or anything, if he knew there were two or three people packing in that place?
[02:35:49.083 --> 02:35:51.945]  No, that's why I said I'm going to go ahead and get a concealed carry.
[02:35:52.446 --> 02:35:57.089]  And most of these signs they put on malls are not the real state laws barring it.
[02:35:57.149 --> 02:35:59.571]  It's alcohol and tobacco and where it's served.
[02:36:00.132 --> 02:36:03.234]  And that's the only place you can really stop that.
[02:36:03.334 --> 02:36:05.236]  And so those are fraudulent signs, most of them.
[02:36:05.256 --> 02:36:06.697]  But you've got to learn how to identify them.
[02:36:07.304 --> 02:36:16.568]  Yeah, but the thing is, if he knew that two or three people were carrying and he didn't know which ones they were, so he knew that as soon as he started shooting he was going to get blasted, would he do it?
[02:36:18.329 --> 02:36:24.071]  Well, you know, they're always on Prozac or a combination of those type of drugs.
[02:36:24.552 --> 02:36:28.933]  Somebody emailed me going, only, only Kleibold was on it and Harris wasn't.
[02:36:28.954 --> 02:36:30.554]  That was more media disinfo.
[02:36:30.774 --> 02:36:33.836]  It's like the media first said this latest kid wasn't on it and they had to admit it.
[02:36:34.156 --> 02:36:36.737]  But then somebody will pull that article out years from now and say he wasn't.
[02:36:38.019 --> 02:36:44.583]  My question, though, was there was another kid there as well, and when the cops got there, they found him huddling under a bench, didn't they?
[02:36:44.964 --> 02:36:45.244]  Yes.
[02:36:45.824 --> 02:36:52.088]  So that certainly sounds to me like there was two of them, and he didn't have to worry about his friends shooting him, so what was he doing under a bench?
[02:36:52.388 --> 02:36:57.512]  Right from the second I heard that, I thought, must have been somebody blasted Kid A and Kid B ducked under a bench.
[02:36:57.852 --> 02:37:00.734]  And whoever blasted Kid A, of course, used his head and just walked out.
[02:37:01.274 --> 02:37:01.594]  I hear you.
[02:37:01.614 --> 02:37:03.756]  Appreciate the call, Pete.
[02:37:03.816 --> 02:37:04.977]  Terry in Pennsylvania.
[02:37:04.997 --> 02:37:05.457]  You're on the air.
[02:37:08.534 --> 02:37:13.536]  Yeah, yesterday on TV they showed genetically modified cats that glow in the dark.
[02:37:14.157 --> 02:37:15.237]  That's not why I called.
[02:37:15.517 --> 02:37:16.177]  Really, they did?
[02:37:16.538 --> 02:37:17.738]  Yeah.
[02:37:17.818 --> 02:37:18.759]  That's not why I called.
[02:37:18.959 --> 02:37:20.239]  It doesn't exist.
[02:37:20.279 --> 02:37:20.980]  None of it exists.
[02:37:21.040 --> 02:37:21.660]  Everything's fine.
[02:37:21.760 --> 02:37:37.567]  When Pratt was on, the signal fell out, so I don't know if he mentioned this or not when I was listening, but on this veteran that he was talking about, and I saw this one time and only one time because I was doing a lot of channel surfing on this, and he said that there was a security guard
[02:37:38.035 --> 02:37:39.736]  He was cowering in hiding, was armed.
[02:37:40.156 --> 02:37:43.439]  He asked the guy, give me your gun, give me your pistol, I'm going to go get this guy.
[02:37:43.739 --> 02:37:44.699]  The guard refused.
[02:37:45.120 --> 02:37:50.823]  He stood up and he yelled at the shooter, and the shooter turned around and shot at him, nicked his arm.
[02:37:51.123 --> 02:37:54.586]  He again turned to the security guard who was cowering in hiding.
[02:37:55.086 --> 02:37:56.907]  He says, give me your pistol, I'm going to go get him.
[02:37:56.947 --> 02:37:58.828]  The guard again a second time refused.
[02:37:59.229 --> 02:38:04.352]  At that time, he says, he saw this girl running towards this fellow, shooting at him and yelling at him.
[02:38:04.692 --> 02:38:07.394]  And he says, when he dropped, he ran up to him,
[02:38:07.938 --> 02:38:10.339]  And it was a pistol there, with the stovepipe.
[02:38:10.559 --> 02:38:13.701]  He picked the pistol up, cleared the stovepipe, chambered another round in.
[02:38:14.101 --> 02:38:16.302]  He says, we didn't know if there was another shooter there.
[02:38:16.622 --> 02:38:19.864]  You might want to have him on as a guest, because he was very articulate.
[02:38:19.924 --> 02:38:20.304]  Help us!
[02:38:20.364 --> 02:38:21.325]  We don't have the staff.
[02:38:21.405 --> 02:38:22.265]  Find out his name.
[02:38:22.285 --> 02:38:23.806]  I remember hearing about that.
[02:38:23.826 --> 02:38:24.546]  I didn't see that.
[02:38:24.606 --> 02:38:27.028]  I know that that story is at least proven once.
[02:38:27.048 --> 02:38:27.768]  Not one time.
[02:38:27.788 --> 02:38:31.250]  Alex, I don't have a computer or anything, so there's no way I can get to you.
[02:38:31.490 --> 02:38:31.730]  OK.
[02:38:32.390 --> 02:38:33.071]  A second thing.
[02:38:33.091 --> 02:38:33.251]  No, no.
[02:38:33.271 --> 02:38:34.572]  I'm talking to our general audience here.
[02:38:34.632 --> 02:38:34.972]  Oh, OK.
[02:38:35.132 --> 02:38:35.232]  OK.
[02:38:35.905 --> 02:38:37.486]  Because I only saw this once.
[02:38:37.646 --> 02:38:42.029]  They showed this guy on several times, but that part of it, they only showed once.
[02:38:42.829 --> 02:38:50.114]  Also, only one time that I saw, and I think it was on Fox, she's a psychiatrist slash psychologist consultant.
[02:38:50.394 --> 02:38:51.174]  Is that the blonde?
[02:38:51.695 --> 02:38:52.375]  She's blonde.
[02:38:52.475 --> 02:38:54.136]  That's a porn actress, you know, go ahead.
[02:38:54.156 --> 02:38:54.536]  I don't know.
[02:38:54.616 --> 02:39:00.400]  Well, she says we're going to have to start arming ourselves, because this shows that we could stop this type of stuff.
[02:39:00.720 --> 02:39:05.403]  And if the, more or less, she elucidated that if the common person was armed,
[02:39:05.854 --> 02:39:09.037]  We could stop this and this wouldn't accelerate to where it's been going.
[02:39:09.358 --> 02:39:09.978]  Interesting.
[02:39:10.078 --> 02:39:12.321]  This would send a message to these type of people.
[02:39:12.741 --> 02:39:13.302]  Absolutely.
[02:39:13.342 --> 02:39:14.083]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:14.683 --> 02:39:16.905]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:39:16.945 --> 02:39:18.827]  Let's talk to Trevor in Ohio.
[02:39:18.867 --> 02:39:21.670]  You're on the air.
[02:39:21.690 --> 02:39:21.850]  Hello?
[02:39:22.051 --> 02:39:22.351]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:23.352 --> 02:39:23.913]  How you doing today?
[02:39:24.053 --> 02:39:24.293]  Good.
[02:39:25.154 --> 02:39:26.075]  Merry Christmas to you.
[02:39:26.415 --> 02:39:27.276]  Merry Christmas to you.
[02:39:28.720 --> 02:39:32.241]  Feels good to say that in our crazy world of PC now.
[02:39:32.641 --> 02:39:38.483]  That's right, you can put up all the crescent moons and menorahs you want, but don't you dare at the White House put up a cross.
[02:39:40.084 --> 02:39:41.944]  Because the vampires don't like it.
[02:39:42.564 --> 02:39:50.187]  Hey, I wanted to comment on what you said, I think it was maybe a couple days ago, just when you quoted Romans.
[02:39:51.403 --> 02:39:56.865]  The kind of verse talking about submitting to authority and that sort of thing.
[02:39:56.885 --> 02:40:02.027]  I thought you brought up a good point because I just see such a problem in the U.S.
[02:40:02.067 --> 02:40:11.290]  now of how I feel like Bush in his last election completely hijacked the evangelical population of the U.S.
[02:40:11.330 --> 02:40:13.671]  with saying those two certain things of
[02:40:14.204 --> 02:40:22.491]  I'm against homosexuals and abortion, and then, okay, vote for me, but you have absolutely no idea what my plans are and what I'm going to try to do in this world.
[02:40:23.171 --> 02:40:24.492]  So I thought you brought up a great point.
[02:40:24.512 --> 02:40:26.173]  Yeah, they use it as a political football.
[02:40:26.213 --> 02:40:27.094]  It means nothing to them.
[02:40:27.514 --> 02:40:28.675]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:40:28.836 --> 02:40:29.836]  It's a litmus test.
[02:40:30.577 --> 02:40:42.246]  And so I thought you brought up a great point, you know, that we need to, you know, as believers, we need to see that, you know, there's a difference between just submitting to authority, because obviously we need law.
[02:40:42.306 --> 02:40:43.287]  Law is a good thing.
[02:40:43.911 --> 02:41:03.939]  But, at the same time, we need to put that through the filter of like, okay, is this, you know, how is this looking like either Antichrist government, or it was moving that way, and when that time comes, we are going to have to... Yeah, according to that litmus test of Romans 13, the way they misinterpret it, we should worship Antichrist and submit to him.
[02:41:03.959 --> 02:41:04.579]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:04.919 --> 02:41:05.499]  Good points.
[02:41:05.619 --> 02:41:06.920]  Moving quicker as we get to everybody.
[02:41:07.660 --> 02:41:09.961]  Let's go to Scott in Australia.
[02:41:10.441 --> 02:41:12.042]  Scott, you're on the air, then Patrick.
[02:41:12.062 --> 02:41:12.382]  Go ahead.
[02:41:13.956 --> 02:41:14.516]  Good day, Alex.
[02:41:14.616 --> 02:41:15.817]  How are you doing?
[02:41:15.997 --> 02:41:16.557]  Good day, sir.
[02:41:19.039 --> 02:41:20.399]  Bless you and all your listeners.
[02:41:20.720 --> 02:41:25.102]  I used to listen to you for about every day for nine months from September last year.
[02:41:27.403 --> 02:41:30.405]  And anyway, let's see.
[02:41:30.965 --> 02:41:33.886]  Jim Mars has interviewed Greg Brayden.
[02:41:34.007 --> 02:41:35.787]  Have you ever heard of Greg Brayden?
[02:41:37.468 --> 02:41:38.349]  Refresh my memory.
[02:41:39.329 --> 02:41:41.090]  Greg Brayden talks about the
[02:41:43.274 --> 02:41:47.916]  The lost science and the lost art of prayer?
[02:41:49.937 --> 02:41:50.818]  Not familiar with it.
[02:41:51.998 --> 02:41:56.781]  And, well apparently, prayer is a feeling.
[02:41:58.322 --> 02:42:08.247]  And if you have a feeling on the inside that is, according to quantum physics, that is reflected in the outer world.
[02:42:08.327 --> 02:42:09.347]  It's mirrored back to you.
[02:42:09.427 --> 02:42:12.789]  So, if you have a feeling of inner peace,
[02:42:14.062 --> 02:42:16.923]  That is reflected in the outer world, in Oedipus.
[02:42:17.683 --> 02:42:42.692]  I don't understand the mathematics, but I know major universities, this is not the New Age quack department, but I've seen a bunch of reports from major universities now saying they believe, even focusing radio telescopes on different antimatter clusters and other things, and black holes and things, and now they're believing in mathematics with computers, that they're thoughts, that scientists even thinking about
[02:42:44.154 --> 02:42:49.497]  Uh, dark matter and other things, somehow, they believe... I can't understand the mathematics.
[02:42:49.957 --> 02:42:53.559]  I mean, at that level, it gets into it, but now mathematics is showing that.
[02:42:54.599 --> 02:43:11.347]  But, um, people may not think, oh, that's... they may dismiss what you just said and think... but how that, how that, this comes back to where we are, where we all are, is, um, we may have created it,
[02:43:12.051 --> 02:43:14.132]  Especially with the media.
[02:43:14.993 --> 02:43:21.997]  Actually, if we go back to the Bible, um, that was created out of, uh, they had about 50 texts to choose from.
[02:43:22.037 --> 02:43:24.479]  They didn't use 25 of them.
[02:43:25.300 --> 02:43:26.000]  This was back in the 400s.
[02:43:26.020 --> 02:43:28.702]  The, uh, who were they?
[02:43:29.282 --> 02:43:30.343]  Some council of us.
[02:43:31.624 --> 02:43:32.724]  Some council was involved.
[02:43:32.764 --> 02:43:35.006]  It's in his book, The Isaiah Effect.
[02:43:35.446 --> 02:43:36.787]  Well, listen, I'll have to check into it.
[02:43:36.807 --> 02:43:38.048]  Good to hear from you from Australia.
[02:43:38.088 --> 02:43:39.148]  God bless and take care.
[02:43:39.549 --> 02:43:41.050]  Patrick in Washington State.
[02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:41.450]  Go ahead.
[02:43:44.342 --> 02:43:44.902]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:43:56.912 --> 02:43:59.533]  Pulled something very North American Union-ish.
[02:43:59.593 --> 02:44:01.934]  They got rid of checks completely.
[02:44:01.954 --> 02:44:03.395]  Yeah, they're doing that everywhere.
[02:44:03.455 --> 02:44:14.299]  Making you go to transfer, and the head of Visa and the head of MasterCard in the last couple years have both said that by 2011 they plan to get rid of cash entirely.
[02:44:14.319 --> 02:44:16.660]  I don't know if they'll be able to do that, but they're making the claim.
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:17.341]  They're making the move.
[02:44:18.021 --> 02:44:20.742]  Yeah, I got a Visa card now.
[02:44:20.782 --> 02:44:21.602]  It's pretty messed up.
[02:44:21.642 --> 02:44:22.923]  The other thing, real quick,
[02:44:23.544 --> 02:44:29.249]  I just recently came across something that said the real idea got pushed to December of 2009.
[02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:30.851]  Yeah, not true.
[02:44:31.291 --> 02:44:37.097]  That's just the official adoption and codified, because the states were freaking out because of the public announcement.
[02:44:37.717 --> 02:44:40.040]  The states are already unified in the same database.
[02:44:40.100 --> 02:44:41.341]  It's actually internationalized.
[02:44:41.841 --> 02:44:44.163]  So it's just more of their coup by stealth craft?
[02:44:44.444 --> 02:44:45.425]  It's more of them, yeah.
[02:44:46.025 --> 02:44:48.468]  As soon as there's resistance, they just then deny it exists again.
[02:44:49.850 --> 02:44:50.150]  Great.
[02:44:50.270 --> 02:44:51.031]  Thank you very much.
[02:44:51.451 --> 02:44:52.011]  You bet, sir.
[02:44:52.031 --> 02:44:52.692]  Good to hear from you.
[02:44:53.612 --> 02:44:55.293]  Let's talk to John in Virginia.
[02:44:55.353 --> 02:44:56.214]  John, go ahead.
[02:44:56.914 --> 02:44:59.636]  Yeah, Alex, if you'll excuse me, I got a cold.
[02:45:00.757 --> 02:45:03.638]  My comment, this question is on Ron Paul.
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:09.722]  Your listeners in New Hampshire and Iowa really need to get out to these caucuses.
[02:45:09.862 --> 02:45:17.707]  His message resonates with truth, and people are drawn to it, but the problem I'm hearing from a lot of my
[02:45:19.199 --> 02:45:22.811]  Friends and family is that they don't think he's got a chance to win.
[02:45:23.559 --> 02:45:26.942]  So, it's key that he wins one of these caucuses.
[02:45:27.182 --> 02:45:28.903]  But see, that's how propaganda works.
[02:45:28.943 --> 02:45:30.024]  That's how propaganda works.
[02:45:30.044 --> 02:45:34.247]  They just say he doesn't have a chance, and so people go, yeah, I love him, but he doesn't have a chance.
[02:45:34.287 --> 02:45:38.531]  The point is, you tell them this, none of the other Republicans have a chance against Hillary.
[02:45:38.951 --> 02:45:45.496]  Ron Paul is popular in all these national caucuses, globally, in the U.S., across the political spectrum.
[02:45:45.796 --> 02:45:51.301]  You can show them articles that document it, articles we've written that source mainstream polls and data.
[02:45:51.721 --> 02:45:52.642]  Talk to you.
[02:45:52.662 --> 02:45:53.983]  I got a cold too, so bear with me.
[02:45:54.383 --> 02:45:56.585]  You guys had on the program yesterday that Mr. Bean
[02:46:15.683 --> 02:46:17.466]  Yeah, let me just recap for folks that don't know.
[02:46:26.784 --> 02:46:31.326]  Uh, Fred Thompson having exclusive access, not just to Mr. Bean in Florida, but other gun shows around the country.
[02:46:32.087 --> 02:46:39.191]  And, uh, then we got Mr. Bean on, who had reportedly, according to the listeners, kicked people even with Ron Paul shirts out for just trying to get in.
[02:46:39.211 --> 02:46:41.772]  And, uh, he said, no, I've never done that.
[02:46:41.792 --> 02:46:44.013]  And then I said, okay, well, here's a gentleman who said you did.
[02:46:44.053 --> 02:46:44.673]  He knew his name.
[02:46:44.693 --> 02:46:46.394]  He said, okay, well, I did kick him out.
[02:46:46.434 --> 02:46:46.654]  Yes.
[02:46:47.435 --> 02:46:49.436]  Well, he, he, he knows my name too.
[02:46:49.816 --> 02:46:55.119]  Basically what happened was we came over from a parade and, uh, it was the Crestview or the, uh, Fort Walton gun show.
[02:46:55.765 --> 02:46:56.406]  We walked in.
[02:46:56.446 --> 02:46:56.926]  He grabbed us.
[02:46:56.946 --> 02:46:58.287]  He said, I don't want anything handed out.
[02:46:58.447 --> 02:46:59.308]  And we said, fine.
[02:46:59.368 --> 02:47:00.989]  We're here for the guns, which I was.
[02:47:01.589 --> 02:47:04.852]  I paid my six bucks, walked in a door about 20 minutes later.
[02:47:04.872 --> 02:47:17.481]  Uh, we were standing there looking at a gun and, um, the, uh, deputy came around the corner and he, uh, pointed to me and the guy that was with me, we both had our Ron Paul shirts on, pointed at us and said, Hey, you need to follow me.
[02:47:18.322 --> 02:47:22.145]  So we followed him over to the front door and he said, I'm gonna have to ask you gentlemen to leave.
[02:47:22.805 --> 02:47:23.846]  And I said, for what reason?
[02:47:24.066 --> 02:47:25.047]  And he pointed to Mr. Bean.
[02:47:25.874 --> 02:47:27.955]  And he said, uh, that gentleman there says he wants you to go.
[02:47:27.995 --> 02:47:29.456]  And I looked at Mr. Bean and I said, what's the problem?
[02:47:30.036 --> 02:47:31.937]  He said, I don't need to give you any excuses.
[02:47:31.997 --> 02:47:32.998]  I want you out of the building.
[02:47:33.758 --> 02:47:34.639]  So I said, okay, fine.
[02:47:34.659 --> 02:47:35.399]  Give me my money back.
[02:47:35.439 --> 02:47:35.780]  I'll leave.
[02:47:36.140 --> 02:47:37.601]  He said, no, you're not getting your money back.
[02:47:38.481 --> 02:47:43.804]  Well, at that point, of course, I got a little irate because now not only is he a liar based on the show yesterday, he's also a thief.
[02:47:44.024 --> 02:47:45.525]  And, uh, I hope you can quote me on that.
[02:47:46.145 --> 02:47:51.368]  But, uh, anyway, so the officers saw that I was getting aggravated and I said, you're gonna have to leave the building.
[02:47:51.388 --> 02:47:52.309]  So I stepped out of the building.
[02:47:52.947 --> 02:47:56.388]  I stood in the doorway and I asked Mr. Bean for his name because at the time I didn't know what it was.
[02:47:57.168 --> 02:47:59.548]  And he got irate and said, I want them arrested.
[02:47:59.568 --> 02:48:00.369]  Get them off the property.
[02:48:01.149 --> 02:48:02.509]  Well, the property is public property.
[02:48:02.989 --> 02:48:04.850]  And I said, you know, that's not going to happen.
[02:48:04.890 --> 02:48:06.470]  But that's the way it went down.
[02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:08.230]  And all we had on was a shirt.
[02:48:08.871 --> 02:48:10.571]  We were not handing out any information.
[02:48:10.591 --> 02:48:13.352]  We weren't even talking about Ron Paul while we were there.
[02:48:14.092 --> 02:48:16.952]  The Thompson crew that was there, you know, it just amazes me.
[02:48:16.992 --> 02:48:19.473]  It tells you the character of Mr. Bean just that he brought Thompson in.
[02:48:20.023 --> 02:48:21.584]  And allowed him to take over his gun shows.
[02:48:21.664 --> 02:48:25.026]  I mean, that right there gives you a real good indication the man's just after some money.
[02:48:25.907 --> 02:48:26.908]  Uh, but that's what happened.
[02:48:26.948 --> 02:48:28.269]  And what's your full name, sir?
[02:48:28.809 --> 02:48:29.890]  My name is Art Coburn.
[02:48:29.910 --> 02:48:35.433]  The deputy took down all my, all my information and tried to, uh, you know, make me nervous about everything.
[02:48:35.573 --> 02:48:37.575]  Well, you're evil wearing a t-shirt in America.
[02:48:37.935 --> 02:48:38.635]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:38.676 --> 02:48:39.456]  Thanks for the info.
[02:48:40.036 --> 02:48:41.357]  We'll be right back, final segment.
[02:48:50.490 --> 02:48:55.671]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:48:55.731 --> 02:48:57.172]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:57.192 --> 02:49:00.453]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[02:49:00.993 --> 02:49:03.434]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.194 --> 02:49:11.556]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.537 --> 02:49:19.498]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.998 --> 02:49:23.480]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:26.362]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world, doesn't it?
[02:49:26.402 --> 02:49:27.563]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.583 --> 02:49:28.323]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.343 --> 02:49:29.444]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.624 --> 02:49:30.384]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.625 --> 02:49:31.485]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:49:43.272 --> 02:49:44.453]  You have been warned.
[02:49:45.490 --> 02:49:48.372]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:49:48.732 --> 02:49:51.593]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:49:51.833 --> 02:49:58.017]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:50:45.053 --> 02:50:50.537]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:50:50.978 --> 02:50:55.201]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:50:55.622 --> 02:51:02.488]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:51:02.908 --> 02:51:09.634]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:51:09.954 --> 02:51:11.555]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:51:11.855 --> 02:51:15.038]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:51:15.318 --> 02:51:17.780]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:51:18.080 --> 02:51:24.806]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:51:25.246 --> 02:51:27.928]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:51:28.188 --> 02:51:31.571]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free at 866-885-6625.
[02:51:31.611 --> 02:51:31.971]  That's 866-885-6625.
[02:51:32.031 --> 02:51:33.793]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[02:52:01.312 --> 02:52:07.075]  For only about 55 hours or less, Out From The Money Bomb starts...
[02:52:31.767 --> 02:52:35.049]  At midnight, the start of Sunday, the 16th Boston Tea Party.
[02:52:35.069 --> 02:52:36.069]  Look, I know we've got a lot of phones.
[02:52:36.129 --> 02:52:36.549]  I'm sorry.
[02:52:36.569 --> 02:52:37.430]  No more time for calls.
[02:52:38.250 --> 02:52:42.752]  We've got Daniel Estelin from Spain tomorrow and Naomi Wolf.
[02:52:43.052 --> 02:52:44.753]  Naomi Wolf for a full hour, by the way.
[02:52:45.273 --> 02:52:46.534]  She's really impressed with our info.
[02:52:46.554 --> 02:52:48.555]  We're giving her a bunch of info on the Bush-Nazi connection.
[02:52:49.435 --> 02:52:51.876]  That is coming up tomorrow.
[02:52:51.896 --> 02:52:52.277]  That's what we do.
[02:52:52.317 --> 02:52:55.258]  We try to push info, give people other info, spread the message.
[02:52:56.010 --> 02:52:59.312]  That isn't about who got the info or who progenerated it.
[02:52:59.492 --> 02:53:00.833]  It's about getting it out.
[02:53:00.913 --> 02:53:02.654]  It's about us together as a team.
[02:53:02.674 --> 02:53:06.236]  I want to play a few final Ron Paul ads.
[02:53:06.256 --> 02:53:07.357]  We'll announce that tonight or tomorrow.
[02:53:07.417 --> 02:53:08.798]  I promise by tomorrow's showtime.
[02:53:08.978 --> 02:53:12.880]  I just... We're writing some articles about it and a lot more.
[02:53:14.429 --> 02:53:15.570]  The show's about to restart.
[02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:18.972]  In the first hour, I played, I don't know, like 14 different clips.
[02:53:19.132 --> 02:53:20.453]  There's a few more we're going to play now.
[02:53:20.893 --> 02:53:32.021]  But if you missed any of these audio clips of the video that's at truthnews.us, the video and radio ads, that'll be coming up at the retransmission that starts on the web in just about four minutes at infowars.com.
[02:53:32.101 --> 02:53:41.467]  You just go to infowars.com and right there you can see the stream where we restream the show 21 hours a day until we're back live tomorrow.
[02:53:42.316 --> 02:53:42.916]  At 11 a.m.
[02:53:42.956 --> 02:53:45.637]  Central and then Sunday I'll be back live at 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:53:45.657 --> 02:53:49.799]  during a Ron Paul Money Bomb for the Sunday Syndicated Transmission.
[02:53:50.779 --> 02:53:56.562]  Now, here are the two final Ron Paul ads that we have time to play today.
[02:53:56.582 --> 02:54:00.203]  This is just a drive-by Ron Paul that some of our listeners did.
[02:54:01.203 --> 02:54:07.406]  And this is them driving by football stadiums, party goers, people in downtown areas, in markets.
[02:54:07.466 --> 02:54:07.846]  Here it is.
[02:54:10.009 --> 02:54:11.529]  Ron Paul for President!
[02:54:11.569 --> 02:54:13.270]  First real candidate in history!
[02:54:13.330 --> 02:54:14.510]  Google Ron Paul!
[02:54:15.871 --> 02:54:17.511]  Google Ron Paul!
[02:54:17.531 --> 02:54:19.252]  Look up Ron Paul for President!
[02:54:19.292 --> 02:54:20.772]  First real candidate in history!
[02:54:20.872 --> 02:54:22.132]  Ron Paul for President!
[02:54:22.733 --> 02:54:23.933]  RON PAUL!
[02:54:23.953 --> 02:54:24.833]  RON PAUL!
[02:54:24.853 --> 02:54:25.633]  RON PAUL!
[02:54:34.617 --> 02:54:35.418]  Ron Paul 2008!
[02:54:35.658 --> 02:54:38.680]  Donate your money December 16th!
[02:54:38.780 --> 02:54:41.042]  RonPaul2008.com!
[02:54:41.522 --> 02:54:42.222]  Look him up!
[02:54:42.743 --> 02:54:43.543]  Yeah!
[02:54:44.244 --> 02:54:45.905]  Ron Paul for President!
[02:54:45.945 --> 02:54:47.146]  Google Ron Paul!
[02:54:48.147 --> 02:54:48.827]  Look him up!
[02:54:48.867 --> 02:54:50.508]  First real candidate in history!
[02:54:50.528 --> 02:54:53.590]  Alright, that's one of them.
[02:54:53.650 --> 02:54:54.391]  That's one of them.
[02:54:55.051 --> 02:54:56.652]  Here's the last one we have time to play.
[02:54:56.692 --> 02:54:57.953]  It's called Contest Entry.
[02:54:57.973 --> 02:54:58.414]  Here it is.
[02:54:58.994 --> 02:55:02.236]  We first have to have a message worth listening to.
[02:55:06.096 --> 02:55:12.600]  It is acknowledged that the federal government owns all our income and we're permitted to keep a certain percentage.
[02:55:12.681 --> 02:55:17.784]  That is the terrible notion of the personal income tax which we should get rid of.
[02:55:24.268 --> 02:55:24.949]  Who knows?
[02:55:25.229 --> 02:55:25.709]  Who knows?
[02:55:25.789 --> 02:55:29.572]  That may well be a big day and a big event and it may be national news.
[02:55:34.784 --> 02:55:46.458]  So, the sooner we end that notion that the federal government should release the world, run our lives, and run the economy, the better for all of us.
[02:55:46.619 --> 02:55:49.602]  I suspect the world we live in is truly strange.
[02:55:55.558 --> 02:55:57.219]  TruthNews.us.
[02:55:57.359 --> 02:55:59.521]  There's 80 video and radio ads.
[02:55:59.541 --> 02:56:02.123]  80 of them up at TruthNews.us.
[02:56:02.643 --> 02:56:04.264]  Links on InfoWars.com.
[02:56:04.324 --> 02:56:05.825]  Links on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:06.206 --> 02:56:07.627]  Everybody who made an ad is a winner.
[02:56:07.647 --> 02:56:10.849]  Not just the people that'll get $3,100 in prizes.
[02:56:10.889 --> 02:56:12.230]  And we'll be mailing those out tomorrow.
[02:56:12.570 --> 02:56:14.852]  We'll announce it, guaranteed tomorrow, maybe even tonight.
[02:56:16.453 --> 02:56:20.896]  And then you will get the prize money.
[02:56:21.196 --> 02:56:21.957]  But we all win.
[02:56:22.017 --> 02:56:23.058]  God bless you all.
[02:56:23.138 --> 02:56:24.799]  Retransmission starts now!
