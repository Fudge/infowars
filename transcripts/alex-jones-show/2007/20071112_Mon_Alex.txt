[00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:10.049]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:11.510]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.790]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.771]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.011 --> 00:00:22.112]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.098 --> 00:00:40.478]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.578 --> 00:00:41.039]  Welcome.
[00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.959]  It is already the 12th day of November, 2007.
[00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.462]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.403 --> 00:00:52.724]  Huge news on multi-fronts.
[00:00:52.864 --> 00:01:00.927]  Sean Hannity over the weekend got confronted at a big book signing with hardcore information about how he's a fake conservative.
[00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:09.235]  And how real conservatives, real libertarians, true classical liberals are sick of their false left-right controlled paradigm.
[00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:12.737]  And the young men that did this did just a fabulous job.
[00:01:12.797 --> 00:01:18.039]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, but we're going to be playing the audio of that coming up.
[00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:24.382]  And if the men who did this are listening, then they are certainly welcome to call into the show today, listening to them.
[00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:25.383]  There's no doubt they're listeners.
[00:01:27.003 --> 00:01:29.584]  And I want to get them on to give them the proper credit.
[00:01:29.884 --> 00:01:34.666]  They're with We Are Change, but not some fellas that I've seen before or that I know.
[00:01:34.726 --> 00:01:36.006]  They did this out on Long Island.
[00:01:38.527 --> 00:01:40.988]  BBC is talking about apologizing.
[00:01:41.028 --> 00:01:43.708]  That's being debated right now for 9-11 Truth hit piece.
[00:01:43.748 --> 00:01:45.149]  Remember that one about six months ago?
[00:01:46.588 --> 00:01:48.772]  It's talk of the worst recession since 1930s.
[00:01:48.812 --> 00:01:50.755]  That's the New York Sun.
[00:01:51.236 --> 00:01:53.279]  That was a depression in the 1930s.
[00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.723]  Talk of worst recession since 1930s.
[00:01:56.144 --> 00:01:59.450]  Subprime losses may reach $400 billion, Bloomberg reports.
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.582]  Also, why world should ban human cloning?
[00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:09.427]  Expert, medical expert at the United Nations says, but see, they'll just ban it so they can regulate it and control it.
[00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:11.929]  Cloning, a giant step for the first time.
[00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:19.454]  Scientists have created dozens of clone embryos from adult primates, but what are the implications of this technical breakthrough for the future of mankind?
[00:02:19.494 --> 00:02:22.897]  They can clone humans, they've been cloning for decades, now they're just admitting it.
[00:02:25.238 --> 00:02:27.881]  Also, more on the banking situation.
[00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:28.221]  U.S.
[00:02:28.261 --> 00:02:31.464]  banks agree on Superfund, Wall Street Journal reports.
[00:02:31.964 --> 00:02:35.948]  Dollar hits 18th month low versus the yen on credit jitters.
[00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:38.930]  Big Ron Paul news.
[00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.796]  He says he's not interested in joining a third-party run if he doesn't get the Republican nominations.
[00:02:45.843 --> 00:02:49.684]  And donations honoring Veterans Day for Ron Paul campaign to top 2,000.
[00:02:49.744 --> 00:02:51.724]  That was yesterday.
[00:02:51.784 --> 00:02:53.505]  Giving started yesterday, goes through today.
[00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:58.005]  Of course, the 11th is Veterans Day, but the 12th is when it is celebrated.
[00:02:58.606 --> 00:03:00.326]  We do salute the veterans out there.
[00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:02.866]  So we'll be breaking that down as well.
[00:03:03.207 --> 00:03:05.967]  The Clinton Camp admits to planting questions.
[00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:08.928]  Admitted to planting questions in Iowa.
[00:03:09.448 --> 00:03:10.608]  Staging events.
[00:03:11.528 --> 00:03:12.588]  What's new about that?
[00:03:12.608 --> 00:03:16.430]  It just shows from FEMA staging newscasts to staged questions.
[00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.731]  That's how these people operate.
[00:03:18.691 --> 00:03:20.992]  Intel official says say goodbye to privacy.
[00:03:21.132 --> 00:03:22.272]  There's no more Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:22.292 --> 00:03:24.073]  They openly declare war on America.
[00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:29.495]  Supreme Court could take gun case considering banning handguns.
[00:03:29.935 --> 00:03:32.536]  Yes, it's actually beginning to happen right now.
[00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:33.457]  Incredible news.
[00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:36.326]  We need to get Gun Owners of America back on.
[00:03:36.346 --> 00:03:39.347]  That's why I'm telling you, the fight is now, ladies and gentlemen, on the Second Amendment.
[00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:44.068]  Go to GunOwners.org and join today or you're insane if you don't.
[00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:48.089]  You know, I read a little bit of this on air a month ago when it first came out.
[00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.450]  But I didn't read more than a few paragraphs.
[00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.591]  And it's such a huge treatise.
[00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:59.752]  And it's basically got much of the info that I independently have researched.
[00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:00.892]  That's why I know it's accurate.
[00:04:02.345 --> 00:04:04.527]  But just a great job from the Idaho Observer.
[00:04:04.647 --> 00:04:07.370]  This was first posted in globalresearch.ca.
[00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.011]  I'm going to get it reposted.
[00:04:09.852 --> 00:04:12.013]  It's posted a month ago on prisonplanet.com.
[00:04:12.454 --> 00:04:15.516]  But regardless, just type the radiation poisoning of America.
[00:04:15.536 --> 00:04:18.379]  We're going to create a radiation poisoning section.
[00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.200]  We've created a vaccine poisoning section.
[00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:22.883]  Because these are things that are not debatable.
[00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:29.929]  And I thought today, this would probably take an hour to read.
[00:04:31.874 --> 00:04:34.015]  Twelve pages of tiny print.
[00:04:34.876 --> 00:04:39.419]  But it's such a public service that some hour today I'm going to try to read it all.
[00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:41.360]  Not that I'm a good news reader.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.240]  You'll have to bear with me.
[00:04:43.041 --> 00:04:46.863]  But we're not a society of readers, so I'm just going to have to read it on air to get it out there.
[00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.345]  And there's just so much other news, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:50.465 --> 00:04:52.447]  Very important broadcast today.
[00:04:52.787 --> 00:04:55.489]  We'll be live for the next two hours and 55 minutes.
[00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:57.730]  By the way, Loose Change Final Cut is out.
[00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.171]  You can view it right now at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:02.324 --> 00:05:03.726]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:05.868]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.774]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:11.475 --> 00:05:14.258]  It's known as the Bilderberg Movement.
[00:05:14.318 --> 00:05:16.560]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:17.081 --> 00:05:19.484]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.628]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.611 --> 00:05:35.596]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:39.559]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:42.441]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:43.642]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.662 --> 00:05:44.423]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:45.504]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.724 --> 00:05:46.144]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.164 --> 00:05:47.726]  That's what they're after, usually.

[00:08:02.867 --> 00:08:08.870]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.532]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.773 --> 00:08:28.881]  Alright, before I get into all the economic news as it continues to unravel, we're going to have open phones today.
[00:08:29.554 --> 00:08:30.055]  I don't think so.
[00:08:43.746 --> 00:08:47.048]  I want to play you the audio, and this is the way it's done.
[00:08:47.088 --> 00:08:49.149]  This is one of the best confrontations I've seen.
[00:08:49.709 --> 00:08:50.950]  It's done with precision.
[00:08:51.450 --> 00:09:05.658]  They present him with New York Observer and all these other mainstream news articles, where Rupert Murdoch is not just raising campaign money for her secretly the last few years, now publicly, but also strategizing for her, and Roger Ailes
[00:09:06.378 --> 00:09:13.265]  Uh, is helping her as well, and they confront him with all these documents, Sean Hannity, showing that he's a fake conservative.
[00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:15.307]  I mean, at least the U.N.
[00:09:15.367 --> 00:09:22.154]  is evil openly, and wants world socialism with the banks controlling us, and, uh, wants world regulation and control.
[00:09:22.594 --> 00:09:27.639]  Bush and the rest of these guys act like they're conservatives and then triple the size of the government and the budget.
[00:09:28.886 --> 00:09:36.753]  And double the size of the deficit, and triple the size of the BATF, and their federal courts with Republican judges go after the Second Amendment.
[00:09:38.634 --> 00:09:48.243]  I mean, I've heard Sean Hannity before talk for 20 minutes about how we've got to control the borders, and then his solution is Bush's guest worker plan, which is total amnesty, total capitulation.
[00:09:49.103 --> 00:09:53.747]  And so I've just had enough of him, and everywhere he goes, this is what needs to happen.
[00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:54.188]  And of course,
[00:09:55.254 --> 00:09:57.659]  Hannity's handler assaulted the camera guy.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.561]  Get the camera!
[00:09:58.582 --> 00:10:00.085]  You do that to anybody else, you get arrested!
[00:10:00.874 --> 00:10:11.840]  You do that to a cop, or you do that to a citizen, and police are watching, and there were police there, you will be arrested for, wham, slamming somebody's camera when they're not even in somebody's face.
[00:10:12.321 --> 00:10:15.082]  They're being polite, and they go after the camera.
[00:10:15.722 --> 00:10:28.110]  There's also another video of a Fox News cameraman at another event, because people are 30 feet behind him with 9-11 inside job signs on a street corner, and he comes over and rips the sign out of his hand, rips it partially in half.
[00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:30.571]  I mean, that's just how these people operate.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:39.342]  So, without further ado, the first bit of audio is him driving along in his car with his friend, talking about why they're going to confront Sean Hannity.
[00:10:39.362 --> 00:10:40.863]  Then they do confront Sean Hannity.
[00:10:41.183 --> 00:10:42.503]  And again, I salute these men.
[00:10:42.543 --> 00:10:42.963]  Here it is.
[00:10:44.023 --> 00:10:49.645]  Alright, so, we're on our way to Long Island to visit Sean Hannity.
[00:10:49.745 --> 00:10:55.947]  Sean Hannity is a very popular, nationally syndicated radio host.
[00:10:55.987 --> 00:10:59.668]  His job, literally, is to pacify conservatives
[00:11:02.398 --> 00:11:05.059]  We're good to go.
[00:11:30.675 --> 00:11:35.371]  So, everything is liberals this, liberals that, certainly liberals too.
[00:11:37.874 --> 00:11:55.129]  They're a fair share of harm, but Hannity really pushes this left-right paradigm and really drives a wedge between the American people so that we're not fighting the real, true problem, which is, you know, the top-down, real paradigm of liberty versus tyranny.
[00:11:55.369 --> 00:12:00.593]  So Sean Hannity really needs to be confronted, so hopefully we're meeting up with him tonight.
[00:12:01.594 --> 00:12:01.974]  How you doing?
[00:12:02.034 --> 00:12:02.674]  How you doing?
[00:12:02.694 --> 00:12:03.655]  I'm a great American.
[00:12:03.715 --> 00:12:04.375]  Nice to meet you.
[00:12:04.455 --> 00:12:05.335]  Can I shake your hand?
[00:12:05.415 --> 00:12:05.855]  What's your name?
[00:12:06.275 --> 00:12:07.236]  Uh, my name's Matt.
[00:12:07.276 --> 00:12:08.316]  And your hair looks great, by the way.
[00:12:08.376 --> 00:12:09.576]  I just wanted to show you this.
[00:12:09.636 --> 00:12:11.857]  This is a copy of a few mainstream articles.
[00:12:12.037 --> 00:12:15.078]  Uh, Rupert Murdoch actually is holding a lot of fundraising for Hillary.
[00:12:15.098 --> 00:12:16.318]  The guy who owns Fox.
[00:12:16.358 --> 00:12:17.638]  So you might want to check that out.
[00:12:17.658 --> 00:12:18.679]  I brought some other stuff for you.
[00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:20.179]  Here's a constitution.
[00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:21.159]  You might want to read that over.
[00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:22.199]  I think I've read that.
[00:12:22.299 --> 00:12:23.900]  Ron Paul, uh, card.
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.442]  You are a yellow journalist and a propagandist.
[00:12:27.482 --> 00:12:28.643]  You will be exposed.
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.201]  There you go, Sean Hannity.
[00:12:57.642 --> 00:12:59.823]  You just got yours.
[00:13:02.764 --> 00:13:05.346]  Well, Matt, we just met the great Sean Hannity.
[00:13:05.566 --> 00:13:07.167]  He was very kind.
[00:13:07.227 --> 00:13:07.967]  He was genuine.
[00:13:07.987 --> 00:13:08.807]  He smiled at me.
[00:13:08.887 --> 00:13:10.628]  He smiled right at the camera, too.
[00:13:10.688 --> 00:13:11.029]  He did.
[00:13:12.930 --> 00:13:13.690]  I'm inspired right now.
[00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.911]  I'm inspired to go get an American flag and just wave it.
[00:13:16.171 --> 00:13:18.092]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:18.152 --> 00:13:22.955]  So you can go up and watch a little bit of the end of that video up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:24.773 --> 00:13:37.903]  But when he brought up the fact that Hillary's being basically handled by Fox, Hannity turned white, he looked like a deer in the headlights, and when they said InfoWars.com, they said Ron Paul, he smiled and said, oh, you're one of them.
[00:13:38.243 --> 00:13:42.026]  Then they said InfoWars.com, and he suddenly looked with fear at the camera.
[00:13:42.126 --> 00:13:43.447]  What are you scared of, Sean?
[00:13:44.008 --> 00:13:47.210]  That we're going to show people that you're bought and paid for by the New World Order?
[00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.774]  I mean, this guy, I've seen him on TV say, arrest all militia members in the U.S.
[00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.631]  I've seen him say every child needs a microchip.
[00:13:56.811 --> 00:13:59.552]  I've seen him push Big Brother, and I'm tired of it.
[00:14:00.912 --> 00:14:07.534]  Okay, I went and confronted Janet Reno and all the rest of these people under Clinton, and I'm glad to see other people out confronting the likes of you.
[00:14:08.834 --> 00:14:10.535]  You are not real conservatives.
[00:14:11.655 --> 00:14:14.236]  And I'm tired of you giving us a bad name.
[00:14:14.256 --> 00:14:17.017]  It's like I'm tired of Benny Hinn and people giving Christians a bad name.
[00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:21.318]  We're tired of it, and we're not putting up with you anymore.
[00:14:22.404 --> 00:14:26.766]  So very, very exciting to be able to see that video.
[00:14:26.786 --> 00:14:28.626]  You've got to see Sean Hannity's face.
[00:14:29.086 --> 00:14:34.768]  Again, that's in the main page about halfway down on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:35.168 --> 00:14:37.249]  You can go watch that right now.
[00:14:37.969 --> 00:14:51.754]  Speaking of what's happening in this country and the attack on our liberties that is bipartisan, this is from McClatchy Tribune High Court to look at ban on handguns.
[00:14:53.354 --> 00:14:58.856]  Just last Friday, we had Governors of America and Chairman Larry Pratt on to talk about in the U.N.
[00:14:58.936 --> 00:15:00.917]  Treaty our government's trying to pass right now.
[00:15:00.937 --> 00:15:03.858]  Law of the Sea Treaty, U.N.
[00:15:03.918 --> 00:15:10.881]  regulation of what guns can go over the seas, and to regulate and ban the transport of small arms to this nation and others.
[00:15:13.022 --> 00:15:18.924]  It's all about them having the guns, and humanity not having them so they can have their way with us like they've done in a hundred plus countries.
[00:15:19.805 --> 00:15:20.505]  Like Rwanda.
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.562]  High Court to look at ban on handguns.
[00:15:24.062 --> 00:15:28.926]  The Supreme Court will discuss gun control today in a private conference that soon could explode publicly.
[00:15:29.686 --> 00:15:36.551]  Behind closed doors, the nine justices will consider taking a case that challenges the District of Columbia's stringent handgun ban.
[00:15:36.931 --> 00:15:39.113]  Their ultimate decision will shape.
[00:15:39.233 --> 00:15:39.653]  You hear that?
[00:15:40.334 --> 00:15:42.716]  Their ultimate decision will shape.
[00:15:42.976 --> 00:15:43.816]  Will shape.
[00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.918]  Their ultimate decision will shape.
[00:15:47.245 --> 00:15:52.667]  How far other cities and states can go with their own gun restrictions, if they rule.
[00:15:54.908 --> 00:15:58.770]  The Supreme Court has never heard, in 30 plus years, on the D.C.
[00:15:58.810 --> 00:15:59.430]  handgun ban.
[00:16:01.291 --> 00:16:11.836]  And if they rule in favor of it, then ladies and gentlemen, the states and the cities will move with handgun restrictions.
[00:16:13.044 --> 00:16:14.384]  Like Chicago and L.A.
[00:16:14.404 --> 00:16:18.365]  and others have already done, New York and the victim disarmament zone, that it is.
[00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:35.269]  We are in deep trouble, ladies and gentlemen, because many top Second Amendment strategists and experts who chronicle and track all this say the Supreme Court is likely to come out with a ruling that sounds okay to people on the surface.
[00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:39.650]  Okay, well, you can have some restrictions, but once you say you can have restrictions, it's over.
[00:16:42.358 --> 00:16:44.159]  We're in a lot of trouble here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:44.519 --> 00:16:56.127]  If the court decides to take it up, it's very likely it will end up being the most important Second Amendment case in history, said Dennis Hennigan, the legal director of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, like the guns come out of their boxes and do it themselves.
[00:16:56.707 --> 00:17:01.891]  Hennigan predicted it's more likely than not that the necessary four justices will vote to consider the case.
[00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:08.415]  The court will announce its decision Tuesday, that's tomorrow, and oral arguments could be heard next year.
[00:17:09.688 --> 00:17:15.431]  Texas, Florida, and 11 other states weighed in on behalf of gun owners, thank goodness, who are challenging D.C.'
[00:17:15.331 --> 00:17:16.351]  's strict gun laws.
[00:17:16.832 --> 00:17:18.132]  You mean their ban, the victims.
[00:17:18.633 --> 00:17:21.814]  New York and three other states want the gun restrictions upheld.
[00:17:22.454 --> 00:17:24.756]  Pediatricians filed a brief supporting the ban.
[00:17:25.116 --> 00:17:25.276]  Oh!
[00:17:28.818 --> 00:17:33.320]  A Northern California gun dealer, Russell Nordick, filed a brief opposing it.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.402]  And you can link through it on PrisonPlanet.com and read the rest of the lengthy story.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:45.405]  There it is, ladies and gentlemen, and that's what we're facing right now as a society.
[00:17:48.747 --> 00:17:50.649]  That's what we're dealing with right now.
[00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.312]  And those are the type of stakes that we're fighting for.
[00:17:56.698 --> 00:17:57.959]  A total free number to join us.
[00:17:58.019 --> 00:18:04.066]  Wide open phones throughout the broadcast today on the Second Amendment, on the brewing war, on the plunging dollar, on what's happening to the economy.
[00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:04.506]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:04.526 --> 00:18:04.586]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:18:04.606 --> 00:18:07.429]  Later in the broadcast I'm going to cover a story by Amy Worthington.
[00:18:16.613 --> 00:18:31.820]  And I've done years of research on cell phone towers, and we've covered hundreds of articles here, but I've never done what she's done, as the Idaho Observer, and also posted at Global Research, to go through and condense it all, though it is 12 pages, that is condensed, into the admissions.
[00:18:32.001 --> 00:18:41.165]  And I heard George Gordon last night as a Sunday radio program, and I was listening to him locally, and I heard him reading for 30 minutes driving home most of this article, a large portion of it,
[00:18:42.682 --> 00:18:44.763]  And I was like, oh yeah, I remember having that article a month ago.
[00:18:44.783 --> 00:18:47.385]  I should have covered that and I realized I haven't done a good job.
[00:18:47.785 --> 00:18:50.207]  Just like on vaccines, I haven't done a good enough job.
[00:18:51.028 --> 00:19:05.397]  We're going to expand our vaccine site on Prison Planet that shows you there is no law, you have to take it, that there are waivers for schools, that it still has mercury in it and all the studies that it's killing people and causing autism and the rest of it and sudden death infant syndrome.
[00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:06.438]  We've done that.
[00:19:06.598 --> 00:19:07.819]  We're going to keep beefing that up.
[00:19:07.859 --> 00:19:08.839]  We have limited staff though.
[00:19:11.321 --> 00:19:16.782]  But listen, there's people out there who are more skilled and more intelligent than I. Why don't you go build websites with all this?
[00:19:17.483 --> 00:19:18.383]  And just focus on it.
[00:19:18.443 --> 00:19:19.143]  I'll link to it.
[00:19:19.263 --> 00:19:21.524]  I mean, I'll clone it.
[00:19:21.984 --> 00:19:23.484]  Or clone what we've posted.
[00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:25.325]  We need to get this out to people.
[00:19:26.025 --> 00:19:30.746]  And we're going to create a section on the site on radiation exposure, radiation pollution.
[00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:32.446]  Because this is not debatable.
[00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:34.947]  This is not debatable.
[00:19:35.447 --> 00:19:37.027]  And this is a subject we're going to be covering.
[00:19:37.047 --> 00:19:39.188]  And there's a bunch of others we're creating data pages on.
[00:19:39.904 --> 00:19:40.945]  To try to save people.
[00:19:41.125 --> 00:19:42.346]  This is important work.
[00:19:43.287 --> 00:19:43.848]  And that's it.
[00:19:44.168 --> 00:19:47.471]  I've been rationalizing and saying I'm not going to use a cell phone, but still doing it.
[00:19:47.932 --> 00:19:48.993]  I'm getting rid of my cell phone.
[00:19:49.093 --> 00:19:49.393]  That's it.
[00:19:50.514 --> 00:19:50.755]  Okay?
[00:19:51.736 --> 00:19:52.456]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:19:52.476 --> 00:19:52.817]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.747 --> 00:20:03.788]  Gold is like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:10.173]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:10.353 --> 00:20:14.156]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:14.516 --> 00:20:16.417]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:16.457 --> 00:20:18.759]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:18.899 --> 00:20:26.544]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:20:26.544 --> 00:20:27.405]  We're good to go.
[00:20:41.761 --> 00:20:47.406]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:20:47.707 --> 00:20:50.249]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:50.269 --> 00:20:56.635]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:20:56.775 --> 00:20:57.836]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.821]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.841 --> 00:21:12.103]  Did you know that one of the 45 objectives of international communism was to have America become involved in free trade?
[00:21:12.683 --> 00:21:22.565]  Without tariffs on cheaply produced foreign goods, our manufacturing base, which would not be able to compete, would be forced to move their manufacturing plants overseas or to Mexico.
[00:21:23.285 --> 00:21:29.467]  This would throw millions of workers out of work and completely destroy the middle class that has made America great.
[00:21:30.207 --> 00:21:37.853]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:06.471]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:22:06.891 --> 00:22:11.632]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:22:12.032 --> 00:22:14.633]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:22:15.133 --> 00:22:18.554]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:22:19.314 --> 00:22:23.655]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:22:24.095 --> 00:22:27.275]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:22:27.875 --> 00:22:30.716]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:22:31.494 --> 00:22:33.635]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:22:33.675 --> 00:22:35.436]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:22:35.456 --> 00:22:35.556]  U.S.
[00:22:35.656 --> 00:22:37.877]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:22:37.897 --> 00:22:38.177]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:22:38.197 --> 00:22:39.097]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:22:39.117 --> 00:22:39.758]  Ask for George.
[00:22:59.851 --> 00:23:01.012]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle, M.D.
[00:23:01.032 --> 00:23:03.414]  I'm the Nuptial Medical Report here on Genesis.
[00:23:03.554 --> 00:23:06.537]  Allicin is a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:23:06.597 --> 00:23:07.277]  is a real thing.
[00:23:07.337 --> 00:23:14.223]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:23:14.363 --> 00:23:19.627]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:23:19.787 --> 00:23:20.548]  We're good to go!
[00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:51.312]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:23:51.332 --> 00:23:55.394]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:23:55.534 --> 00:23:58.355]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:24:01.577 --> 00:24:05.859]  The next stop that we make will be the sea.
[00:24:05.919 --> 00:24:09.240]  Come on aboard, we're right up inside of you.
[00:24:18.162 --> 00:24:29.982]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board And let this train keep on riding, riding on through
[00:24:47.119 --> 00:24:56.462]  Alright, your call is coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:19.042 --> 00:25:20.703]  Look at some of the medical news I've got today.
[00:25:20.723 --> 00:25:23.065]  The radiation poisoning of America.
[00:25:23.625 --> 00:25:25.667]  Birth control pill linked to cervical cancer.
[00:25:26.387 --> 00:25:26.668]  U.S.
[00:25:26.728 --> 00:25:28.869]  among worst in world for infant death.
[00:25:31.671 --> 00:25:35.134]  Plague blame for biologist's death, yet USA Today.
[00:25:36.575 --> 00:25:39.477]  Fear of dynasty denies Hillary Clinton votes.
[00:25:39.957 --> 00:25:43.500]  Bill Clinton is finding it difficult to transfer votes, affections from him to his wife.
[00:25:44.722 --> 00:25:50.685]  As opponents exploit concerns that two dynasties, the Bush and Clinton families, have dominated American politics for 28 years.
[00:25:50.905 --> 00:25:51.686]  Absolutely.
[00:25:52.786 --> 00:25:56.648]  Democrats are confronting Bush over his spending, pointing out he's not a conservative.
[00:25:57.629 --> 00:26:01.611]  Government seeks to redefine privacy, saying there is no Fourth Amendment.
[00:26:02.291 --> 00:26:03.331]  Absolutely huge.
[00:26:04.192 --> 00:26:10.355]  Hugo Chavez got in an argument with the King of Spain, with the King of Spain screaming, why don't you just shut up, on national television.
[00:26:13.991 --> 00:26:18.295]  Soldiers in England for their Veterans Day yesterday were not allowed to carry rifles.
[00:26:18.836 --> 00:26:20.097]  Again, that's the image for the public.
[00:26:21.198 --> 00:26:26.562]  But the government can then arm the police, which they never have done against the public, but then the military can't show their rifles.
[00:26:26.603 --> 00:26:27.724]  It's all part of conditioning.
[00:26:30.046 --> 00:26:36.511]  Also, top biological chemical weapons expert, says she's been stalked, threatened, a lot of other things have happened, Jill Decker.
[00:26:36.912 --> 00:26:40.095]  She says, I feared I'd end up dead in the woods like Dr. David Kelly, says biologist.
[00:26:40.809 --> 00:26:43.651]  A biological warfare expert who criticized Britain and the U.S.
[00:26:43.671 --> 00:26:48.774]  says, that is just some of what is coming up today.
[00:26:49.994 --> 00:27:06.384]  But one of the stories here that's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, BBC to apologize for 9-11 truth hit piece, scandal hit network desperately scrambles to offset legal action over lies and bias in February 2007 documentary.
[00:27:08.809 --> 00:27:26.589]  The BBC could be forced to apologize and admit mass public deception for airing a documentary on the 9-11 Truth Movement that was clearly riddled with errors, lies, and bias as the scandal-hit corporation desperately squirms to avoid a potential case brought by a British scientist, John A. Blackard.
[00:27:27.443 --> 00:27:28.084]  Let's get him on.
[00:27:28.104 --> 00:27:40.312]  A qualified physicist and mechanical engineer, and a member of the Scholar's Panel of Truth and Justice, is currently engaged in a pre-action protocol with the BBC in an attempt to settle out of court and get an apology from the broadcasters.
[00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:42.874]  It's supposedly government-funded, so they have to be answerable to people.
[00:27:43.414 --> 00:27:47.237]  As well as a guarantee that the program will not be ever shown again on television.
[00:27:47.617 --> 00:27:53.742]  In a letter to the BBC, Blacker cites a catalogue of errors, distortions, and outright lies
[00:27:54.980 --> 00:28:00.844]  That were contained in the program arguing that the documentary is an insult to those that lost their lives on 9-11.
[00:28:03.045 --> 00:28:12.931]  The Conspiracy Files team spoke to and recorded the testimony of many eyewitnesses, firefighters, police officers, and public eyewitnesses also
[00:28:14.162 --> 00:28:24.826]  Officialdom High Witnesses and had access to written testimony from many High Witnesses, what they call it in England, via official sites on the website that he has a link to.
[00:28:25.346 --> 00:28:32.008]  Yet not one single High Witness was presented in the documentary to put the truth in perspective, he adds.
[00:28:32.888 --> 00:28:40.551]  The Conspiracy Files documentary was a work of total public deception from start to end, particularly crafted to stealthily deceive and
[00:28:42.168 --> 00:28:45.311]  Forward nothing, which was conclusive either one way or the other.
[00:28:45.651 --> 00:28:47.813]  In other words, perfect yellow journalism.
[00:28:47.853 --> 00:28:51.456]  Propaganda journalism by stealth, omissions, and deceptions.
[00:28:51.916 --> 00:29:09.372]  Blacker concludes, after citing dozens of examples of bias, fraud, and agenda-driven presentation, and a clear sign that the BBC are struggling to form a case for the legal defense of the program, they have put back a meeting with Blacker for the third time in succession, now agreeing to a late November date.
[00:29:10.228 --> 00:29:22.259]  In our review of the documentary, we slam the program as a tissue of lies, bias, and emotional manipulation from beginning to end, listing 17 clear examples of gross inaccuracy, distortions, obfuscations, and character smears.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:35.772]  After the show aired in the UK, producer Guy Smith appeared on the Alex Jones Show, but failed miserably to address these concerns, only being able to repeat empty soundbites about how the show was intended to be an impartial investigation.
[00:29:36.912 --> 00:29:43.114]  Come back, get into your phone calls and a lot of other news in the next two and a half hours that we have left.
[00:29:43.714 --> 00:29:45.615]  Again, I am honored to be your host.
[00:29:45.635 --> 00:29:47.175]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:47.515 --> 00:29:50.916]  JonesReport.com and TruthNews.us are two excellent sites.
[00:29:52.057 --> 00:29:53.197]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.457 --> 00:29:55.098]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.978 --> 00:29:58.699]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.977 --> 00:30:02.257]  Hemp.
[00:30:02.497 --> 00:30:04.538]  The superfood for you and your family.
[00:30:04.938 --> 00:30:08.200]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:08.960]  Hemp.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.101]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:30:12.462 --> 00:30:12.762]  Hemp.
[00:30:13.102 --> 00:30:19.565]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:30:19.905 --> 00:30:23.166]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:30:23.426 --> 00:30:26.928]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:30:27.048 --> 00:30:27.788]  We're good to go!

[00:31:02.161 --> 00:31:02.801]  It's a fact.
[00:31:03.021 --> 00:31:10.503]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:31:10.623 --> 00:31:17.005]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all
[00:31:17.005 --> 00:31:17.165]  I'm good.
[00:31:36.836 --> 00:31:41.858]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:31:42.038 --> 00:31:46.539]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:31:46.699 --> 00:31:48.480]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.

[00:32:02.641 --> 00:32:04.483]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:32:04.623 --> 00:32:09.809]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:32:09.969 --> 00:32:11.310]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:19.759]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:25.705]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:32:25.865 --> 00:32:27.646]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:32:27.726 --> 00:32:29.887]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:32:29.907 --> 00:32:34.269]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:32:34.429 --> 00:32:36.570]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:32:36.650 --> 00:32:44.413]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:32:44.673 --> 00:32:46.754]  Come, you masters of war Here to build the big guns
[00:33:13.504 --> 00:33:15.909]  Hear the bell of death clangs!
[00:33:39.341 --> 00:33:43.083]  Wake up, boys, there's a light at the window.
[00:33:43.103 --> 00:33:48.206]  I can hear someone knocking on the door.
[00:33:50.146 --> 00:33:54.709]  There are voices in the street and the sound of running feet.
[00:33:55.509 --> 00:33:58.971]  And they whisper the word, REVOLUTION.
[00:34:00.672 --> 00:34:04.634]  There are men coming down from the valley.
[00:34:06.431 --> 00:34:21.121]  There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind Alex!
[00:34:23.522 --> 00:34:32.928]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight
[00:34:35.351 --> 00:34:50.697]  It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:35:06.244 --> 00:35:13.633]  Watch and wait, get ready for the sign.
[00:35:14.013 --> 00:35:17.798]  There are many here among us now who have not seen the light.
[00:35:17.918 --> 00:35:21.502]  We must send the word to all the people in the land.
[00:35:21.882 --> 00:35:23.785]  Go to every hill and mountain.
[00:35:47.373 --> 00:36:11.061]  Oh, there's a rocky hill tonight Under cover of the darkness We will slip behind the lines And we will take The men who have stolen our land For the ills of domination Hit them right between the eyes And light a fire!
[00:36:11.341 --> 00:36:12.642]  Light a fire!
[00:36:12.762 --> 00:36:13.602]  Light a fire!
[00:36:13.682 --> 00:36:16.563]  They'll see through it all!
[00:37:10.527 --> 00:37:26.531]  Roll away the dawn Roll away the dawn and let me see The land of the free Has anything changed at all?
[00:37:29.738 --> 00:37:37.845]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we are back live, about to go to your phone calls.
[00:37:39.146 --> 00:37:46.652]  Now I'm told this is Jason somehow involved with the Sean Hannity being confronted, and I'm told he's been confronted all over the country, wherever he goes now.
[00:37:47.052 --> 00:37:52.716]  We just played that at the start of the show, where they eloquently exposed that Fox News is behind Hillary, something they don't want known.
[00:37:52.756 --> 00:37:54.878]  They want to keep that false paradigm going of left-right.
[00:37:55.258 --> 00:37:57.220]  Jason, were you there, or what do you know about this video?
[00:37:57.987 --> 00:38:04.151]  Hi Alex, actually it has to do with the Giuliani confrontation video that was posted last night in Lublin, Colorado.
[00:38:04.591 --> 00:38:05.572]  Okay, so there's so many.
[00:38:05.612 --> 00:38:07.854]  I was just told we are changed, calling in about the video.
[00:38:07.874 --> 00:38:10.375]  Yes, I've seen the Giuliani, it's up on Prison Planet.
[00:38:10.615 --> 00:38:11.436]  Tell folks about that.
[00:38:12.701 --> 00:38:12.902]  Right.
[00:38:13.002 --> 00:38:14.303]  Well, we were there Saturday.
[00:38:15.124 --> 00:38:16.545]  There was about 10 or 12 of us.
[00:38:17.006 --> 00:38:19.568]  Literally what we did is we had four different confronters.
[00:38:19.608 --> 00:38:21.350]  We had Sander Hicks in from New York.
[00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:26.616]  He was reporting with us and interviewing with us on fire knowledge and whistleblowers.
[00:38:26.716 --> 00:38:35.344]  And so what we did was we kind of coordinated this attack with the idea that we're going to have Sander Hicks question him on the Peter Jennings video that he did on September 11th.
[00:38:36.181 --> 00:38:37.382]  We're good to go.
[00:38:58.911 --> 00:39:00.553]  Tell folks what happened.
[00:39:21.405 --> 00:39:23.427]  Well, uh, we gave him the opportunity to answer that.
[00:39:23.467 --> 00:39:25.188]  He brushed Xander Hicks off twice.
[00:39:25.568 --> 00:39:27.810]  Um, so I made a phone call, uh, had Adam.
[00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:29.972]  He was the first guy who came in yelling.
[00:39:30.032 --> 00:39:33.394]  He was yelling about the, uh, the World Trade Center attacks going off.
[00:39:33.554 --> 00:39:39.198]  And, uh, Giuliani just cackled in his typical cackle, uh, started sipping coffee while they dragged him down.
[00:39:39.359 --> 00:39:43.922]  You could hear in the background, if you turn this volume up, people yelling, tase him, bro, tase him, tase him.
[00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:45.483]  And, uh, it was just insane.
[00:39:45.904 --> 00:39:47.905]  So after they drug him out, it was my chance.
[00:39:47.965 --> 00:39:49.006]  I was on the chair, chair.
[00:39:49.714 --> 00:40:05.685]  And what happened was, I started yelling, a gentleman, and this is on the Fox News local broadcast, came up and punched me twice in the stomach, took me off guard, I yelled at him, I was like, don't punch me bro, and I said, that's assault to him, and you can kind of pick that out of the video.
[00:40:05.725 --> 00:40:07.507]  Look, it's time to file charges.
[00:40:07.967 --> 00:40:10.969]  These Fox camera people and others keep assaulting folks.
[00:40:11.309 --> 00:40:12.590]  This is not Fox Cameran.
[00:40:13.971 --> 00:40:19.633]  This was a Standard Buyer, somebody right next to me, punched me twice and he's like, shut up.
[00:40:21.073 --> 00:40:23.454]  But you know, this kind of is a precedent that's being set out there.
[00:40:23.474 --> 00:40:33.536]  A lot of these Hannity folks... Yeah, Daily Kos just reported that one of their top people, they were calling for him to be arrested for asking a question during a question and answer, a nice question.
[00:40:34.016 --> 00:40:37.257]  I mean, it's getting crazy when he went to Hannity threatening to arrest him.
[00:40:37.277 --> 00:40:39.618]  I mean, it's just, they think there's no First Amendment.
[00:40:40.945 --> 00:40:41.125]  Right.
[00:40:41.165 --> 00:40:45.288]  Well, you know, they're out there saying that 9-11 troopers need to be rounded up and put in jail cells.
[00:40:45.528 --> 00:40:47.989]  They're telling us that we need to be tased and everything else.
[00:40:48.049 --> 00:40:53.132]  And so when these people are out there, I mean, this Giuliani audience was a prime example of this.
[00:40:53.232 --> 00:40:57.155]  And so they think it's okay to come up there and violate my civil liberties by punching me in the stomach.
[00:40:57.975 --> 00:40:59.256]  And that happened there.
[00:40:59.416 --> 00:41:00.937]  And there's multiple other incidences.
[00:41:01.577 --> 00:41:02.718]  How hard did he punch you?
[00:41:03.835 --> 00:41:07.836]  Well, I was so pumped up with adrenaline, I just looked at him and he just started quivering.
[00:41:08.096 --> 00:41:09.856]  I just looked at him and I'm like, that was assault.
[00:41:09.976 --> 00:41:12.937]  And he literally just ran off, like cowering.
[00:41:13.117 --> 00:41:14.237]  I couldn't even believe it.
[00:41:14.777 --> 00:41:18.178]  But, you know, I just dug into... Another enemy of the Republic!
[00:41:19.598 --> 00:41:20.378]  Yeah, it was amazing.
[00:41:20.478 --> 00:41:21.679]  You know, it was absolutely amazing.
[00:41:21.719 --> 00:41:22.479]  And you're so right.
[00:41:22.499 --> 00:41:23.939]  I've been listening to you for a few years now.
[00:41:24.439 --> 00:41:26.880]  And you get into that situation and you're almost out of body.
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.220]  You're just watching yourself go to town on these guys.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.661]  And it's just spirit.
[00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.601]  It starts to flow through you and you just start to work.
[00:41:34.048 --> 00:41:35.409]  The enemy will be defeated.
[00:41:36.009 --> 00:41:37.569]  Listen, have you seen the Hannity video?
[00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:40.710]  When they say Infowars.com, he goes from laughing to looking scared.
[00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.191]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:41:42.211 --> 00:41:43.211]  These guys know what they're doing.
[00:41:43.592 --> 00:41:43.892]  You know?
[00:41:44.232 --> 00:41:45.852]  And Giuliani came in and looked me in the eyes.
[00:41:45.992 --> 00:41:47.293]  I literally just got frustrated.
[00:41:47.533 --> 00:41:51.114]  I took a picture of him for a little momentum, and I jumped down because the cop was following me.
[00:41:51.494 --> 00:41:56.616]  But to get the credit, the Loveland Police Officer, there's some credit.
[00:41:57.096 --> 00:41:58.377]  They were very professional.
[00:41:59.017 --> 00:42:00.678]  One of the cops was standing right next to me.
[00:42:00.718 --> 00:42:02.478]  He gave me a minute on that chair to speak.
[00:42:04.504 --> 00:42:06.786]  Yeah, it was just a fascinating ordeal.
[00:42:06.806 --> 00:42:09.048]  Just to kind of throw some plugs out there, I don't know how much time you got.
[00:42:09.728 --> 00:42:11.530]  I'm the administrator of TruthAlliance.net.
[00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:15.833]  You can go check out the article that we wrote up there, and we also posted the video there.
[00:42:16.113 --> 00:42:19.316]  I'm also a site administrator, but we are ChangeColorado.org.
[00:42:19.456 --> 00:42:20.377]  Good job!
[00:42:20.857 --> 00:42:23.859]  So, I'm a co-founder of TruthAlliance.net.
[00:42:23.899 --> 00:42:28.783]  I would love to talk to you about that someday, but today I just want to talk to you about the event with Giuliani.
[00:42:28.803 --> 00:42:30.224]  Yeah, but I mean, run down what happened.
[00:42:30.244 --> 00:42:31.205]  Give us a blow-by-blow.
[00:42:31.903 --> 00:42:32.403]  Well, yeah.
[00:42:32.604 --> 00:42:39.548]  After my competition, I jumped off that chair, was drug out, told to get off the property, which I complied.
[00:42:40.369 --> 00:42:47.474]  After that, one of our other We Are Change folks, he positioned himself behind Giuliani.
[00:42:47.814 --> 00:42:49.795]  He started yelling at him, calling him a crook and a criminal.
[00:42:50.075 --> 00:42:51.556]  He was drug off the scene.
[00:42:52.037 --> 00:42:55.219]  And then after that, Giuliani did a press conference
[00:42:55.652 --> 00:43:06.459]  Where he was specifically questioned on why is he being confronted all this and you know of course he gave the usual thing that this is America and this happens but you know a lot of people are emotionally charged about 9-11.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.184]  So after that press conference he started filing out, getting ready to get in his car.
[00:43:13.584 --> 00:43:25.292]  That's when Standard Hicks from standardhicks.com, NYC reporter, investigative journalist for 9-11 approached him and asked him about the prior knowledge and then he was drug off as a result.
[00:43:25.848 --> 00:43:31.071]  And, uh, he was actually being arrested, fortunately, because of some of our smart-thinking 9-11 truth activists.
[00:43:31.451 --> 00:43:33.672]  They got in their face and said, why is this man being arrested?
[00:43:33.712 --> 00:43:34.352]  Why is this a man?
[00:43:34.632 --> 00:43:36.173]  We had multiple cameras on this shot.
[00:43:36.933 --> 00:43:40.595]  And, uh... And so he politely asked the question, and, oh, that's a crime!
[00:43:40.615 --> 00:43:41.916]  Seize him immediately!
[00:43:43.627 --> 00:43:44.308]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:43:44.649 --> 00:43:45.810]  And you can see all this stuff.
[00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:47.052]  It's up on the internet right now.
[00:43:47.793 --> 00:43:49.074]  We'll get a report out on it, too.
[00:43:49.094 --> 00:43:50.076]  We'll post your report.
[00:43:50.817 --> 00:43:52.299]  Good job, my friend.
[00:43:52.419 --> 00:43:53.140]  Keep it up.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:59.168]  And again, there's so much great stuff happening, I have trouble even keeping track of it all, but plug the site again where folks can watch the video.
[00:43:59.932 --> 00:44:01.093]  TruthAlliance.net.
[00:44:01.753 --> 00:44:02.993]  You can go see the video on there.
[00:44:03.013 --> 00:44:03.874]  It's on the front page.
[00:44:04.754 --> 00:44:05.454]  Sure.
[00:44:05.635 --> 00:44:06.775]  TruthAlliance.net.
[00:44:07.175 --> 00:44:08.476]  Fabulous job, my friend.
[00:44:08.496 --> 00:44:09.116]  God bless you.
[00:44:09.656 --> 00:44:12.057]  Wow, that's exciting.
[00:44:12.217 --> 00:44:13.258]  Alex in Deutschland.
[00:44:13.698 --> 00:44:14.458]  Alex, you're on the air.
[00:44:14.498 --> 00:44:14.899]  Go ahead.
[00:44:14.919 --> 00:44:18.040]  Hello?
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:19.921]  Yes, go ahead.
[00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:20.321]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:20.721 --> 00:44:25.043]  You might remember me calling in before, a couple of months ago, about my German Daimler Terrastorm.
[00:44:26.063 --> 00:44:26.724]  Yes, I remember.
[00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:26.944]  Yes.
[00:44:27.595 --> 00:44:30.596]  And we've now finished dubs for two more of your movies.
[00:44:31.137 --> 00:44:37.260]  We're also halfway done with Terror Storm 2nd Edition, and we are prepping for Endgame right now, also.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.300]  Well, good!
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:41.181]  I allow it to be out on Google Video.
[00:44:41.221 --> 00:44:42.222]  It's not the highest quality.
[00:44:42.242 --> 00:44:47.364]  It's better for folks to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and download it in super high quality if you're going to take the time to watch it.
[00:44:47.744 --> 00:44:53.067]  But for folks that just run into it, it's a great way to get the word out, and that's my main goal and my main focus.
[00:44:54.159 --> 00:44:54.599]  Absolutely.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.602]  And so we've now finished Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, and Police State 3.
[00:45:00.382 --> 00:45:04.064]  And we're about to start recording on TerrorStorm 2nd Edition.
[00:45:04.164 --> 00:45:11.047]  And after that, I would really love to do the pro-gun movie, Innocence Betrayed, by Truth for Preservation of Firearm Ownership.
[00:45:11.847 --> 00:45:15.709]  Because this issue is absolutely underrepresented in the German truth movement.
[00:45:17.151 --> 00:45:21.373]  Well, that's not my film, and I know they guard their copyrights very closely over at JPL.
[00:45:21.413 --> 00:45:22.134]  No, I know.
[00:45:22.214 --> 00:45:24.095]  I absolutely need to ask him first.
[00:45:24.175 --> 00:45:45.005]  I need to initiate the contact first, but I'd really love to do that because it's an amazing film, and if the Americans do not stop the gun grabbers, you're going to end up where we are now in Germany, where it is absolutely impossible for you to get a concealed carry permit if you're not a cop off-duty or, say, a high-key witness in a mafia case or something.
[00:45:45.896 --> 00:45:47.498]  You see, I'm 23 years old.
[00:45:47.518 --> 00:45:48.760]  I have no criminal record.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:50.622]  I do not take any drugs.
[00:45:51.403 --> 00:46:01.697]  I'm on no medication and I would have to undergo a psychological evaluation if I wanted to buy, if I wanted to get a license for a semi-automatic handgun for sporting purposes.
[00:46:03.779 --> 00:46:05.941]  No, I know.
[00:46:06.141 --> 00:46:11.605]  For all intents and purposes, there's a gun ban, a victim disarmament ban in much of Europe.
[00:46:11.665 --> 00:46:14.887]  Switzerland hasn't done that yet until they have the lowest crime rate in Europe.
[00:46:15.428 --> 00:46:19.971]  England has totally banned guns, and their crime rate has more than doubled in the last ten years since the ban.
[00:46:21.152 --> 00:46:22.993]  They've even shut down little shooting clubs.
[00:46:23.534 --> 00:46:24.695]  And it's all part of slavery.
[00:46:24.775 --> 00:46:28.137]  Slaves are disarmed, and it's happening here in the U.S., and we need to fight it.
[00:46:28.638 --> 00:46:31.780]  Well, your website's InfoKrieg, isn't it?
[00:46:32.722 --> 00:46:35.963]  Infokrieg.tv, and you asked me for my contact info.
[00:46:36.083 --> 00:46:56.028]  I have sent it to you a bunch of times, but it probably got buried under a lot of stuff because you're so busy, but I'd really love to become an official satellite of Prison Planet, because that's what I always intended to be, because you're the best guys out there, and I'd love to make your work available and break the information barrier, the language barrier for people.
[00:46:57.281 --> 00:46:59.122]  My friend, don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:46:59.642 --> 00:47:06.724]  I'm glad you translated the films and I'm glad that you're welcome to take any of our articles and translate them into German if you'd like.
[00:47:06.784 --> 00:47:07.925]  And we just appreciate you.
[00:47:07.945 --> 00:47:08.865]  God bless you, my friend.
[00:47:09.805 --> 00:47:13.027]  Let's go to... Who's up next here?
[00:47:14.307 --> 00:47:15.647]  Joel in California.
[00:47:15.667 --> 00:47:16.208]  You're on the air.
[00:47:16.248 --> 00:47:16.668]  Go ahead.
[00:47:18.068 --> 00:47:18.508]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:18.788 --> 00:47:19.089]  Hi.
[00:47:19.969 --> 00:47:23.190]  Hey, I just wanted to mention about... I just wanted to let you know.
[00:47:23.210 --> 00:47:26.151]  Do you know about the World Trade Center Southside?
[00:47:26.779 --> 00:47:27.489]  Or was damaged?
[00:47:28.692 --> 00:47:40.939]  Well, I've seen TV show the World Financial Center with a big gouge out of it, but I've seen the so-called damage on the corner of the building where you got about a floor or two gouged in a little bit there.
[00:47:40.979 --> 00:47:46.083]  I know that NIST says that didn't cause any structural damage and didn't cause the collapse.
[00:47:46.703 --> 00:47:48.644]  And NIST says the fuel oil tank didn't.
[00:47:49.084 --> 00:47:51.166]  That's the federal government saying that.
[00:47:51.526 --> 00:47:58.190]  But then the quote debunkers run around and claim that that's why Building 7 fell symmetrically at freefall speeds.
[00:47:59.346 --> 00:48:05.551]  That's interesting, but also, there are also eyewitnesses that mention, especially firefighters, that saw the building leaning.
[00:48:05.591 --> 00:48:07.953]  I'm not trying to get into an argument, I just wanted to know if you knew that.
[00:48:08.313 --> 00:48:11.696]  No, no, I have never seen the building leaning.
[00:48:11.716 --> 00:48:22.545]  There's photos and video of the building not leaning, and they've also put out a picture of the World Financial Center with a larger chunk out of it saying that's Building 7, and then they've had to admit that that was actually the World Financial Center.
[00:48:22.825 --> 00:48:24.287]  The World Financial Center was kind of
[00:48:25.237 --> 00:48:31.841]  Kind of cream colored, and then the other one was kind of a, you know, brickish brown color.
[00:48:31.861 --> 00:48:33.262]  Building 7 was.
[00:48:33.602 --> 00:48:47.511]  We had the NIST report, the National, you know, organization, the federal government that studies that, National Institute of Standards and Technology, saying that it was not structural damage that made Building 7 fall.
[00:48:47.951 --> 00:48:48.972]  That didn't answer your question?
[00:48:50.064 --> 00:48:51.164]  I actually did not read that, though.
[00:48:51.184 --> 00:48:53.165]  I was just wondering if you knew all the other stuff.
[00:48:53.245 --> 00:48:54.385]  Thanks for letting me know that.
[00:48:55.185 --> 00:48:55.525]  You bet.
[00:48:55.565 --> 00:49:01.007]  I mean, do you legitimately... I mean, are you really asking that question, or are you one of the quote debunkers?
[00:49:01.867 --> 00:49:06.328]  No, but I've actually read debunkers, you know, and I just wanted to ask if you just knew about that information.
[00:49:06.348 --> 00:49:07.528]  I don't know much about it.
[00:49:07.588 --> 00:49:09.349]  I'm only like 19 years old, man.
[00:49:09.369 --> 00:49:11.829]  I'm not like... Let me ask you this.
[00:49:11.869 --> 00:49:16.651]  Did damage to the building cause the BBC to announce that it had fallen due to fires and structural damage?
[00:49:16.671 --> 00:49:17.951]  The 25 minutes before it fell?
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.383]  Well, they had people saying that the building was leaning once again.
[00:49:22.423 --> 00:49:24.245]  Even firefighters just said that.
[00:49:24.265 --> 00:49:29.650]  But if it was leaning, it would have fallen over leaning or would have partially collapsed, sir.
[00:49:29.931 --> 00:49:30.971]  They had a countdown.
[00:49:30.992 --> 00:49:34.615]  I mean, was it a magic countdown since it was leaning, which it wasn't?
[00:49:34.915 --> 00:49:37.257]  A magic countdown for exactly when it was going to fall?
[00:49:37.277 --> 00:49:39.460]  How did they have a magic countdown?
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:42.783]  I mean, how did they magically know when it was going to fall?
[00:49:42.803 --> 00:49:43.984]  I don't know.
[00:49:44.488 --> 00:49:44.608]  Yeah.
[00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:46.309]  Listen, I really appreciate your call.
[00:49:46.389 --> 00:49:48.391]  I'm glad that I can answer your question.
[00:49:48.851 --> 00:49:57.437]  The bigger question is, did damage to Building 7 cause the hijackers to be trained at the Pensacola Naval Air Station, the Defense Language School, and for two U.S.
[00:49:57.517 --> 00:50:01.279]  Embassy heads to be ordered to let them back into the country and to be told they were U.S.
[00:50:01.319 --> 00:50:01.980]  government agents?
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.742]  Did a small gouge in the side of the building
[00:50:08.228 --> 00:50:19.950]  And by the way, there are official debris field and damage diagrams and photos out there on the New York City websites, on this website, showing that only the dust and light debris hit Building 7.
[00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:23.211]  Did that cause 44,000 U.S.
[00:50:23.231 --> 00:50:27.252]  troops to mash into Zikustan and Uzbekistan for the invasion of Afghanistan?
[00:50:27.412 --> 00:50:30.152]  See, they were pre-deployed to attack Afghanistan beforehand.
[00:50:30.632 --> 00:50:33.893]  A massive deployment, quietly for several months before.
[00:50:34.739 --> 00:50:40.623]  Did the North Tower fall cause them to deploy the troops two months before?
[00:50:41.483 --> 00:50:43.905]  Did they cause them to found Al Qaeda or protect Bin Laden?
[00:50:44.445 --> 00:50:48.448]  Did they cause the Bin Ladens to be British intel agents and own part of the Karwal Group?
[00:50:49.669 --> 00:50:52.330]  Did they cause any of that?
[00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:54.312]  Maybe they did!
[00:50:54.652 --> 00:50:56.853]  Maybe Tower Falling did do all that.
[00:50:57.133 --> 00:50:57.734]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.754 --> 00:50:58.094]  Stay with us.
[00:50:58.314 --> 00:51:00.356]  It is a big idea
[00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:05.991]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.691 --> 00:51:10.934]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:11.615 --> 00:51:13.356]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:14.416 --> 00:51:16.678]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:51:17.218 --> 00:51:19.600]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.382 --> 00:51:27.746]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.747 --> 00:51:35.690]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:36.190 --> 00:51:39.691]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:40.051 --> 00:51:42.572]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.612 --> 00:51:43.752]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.772 --> 00:51:44.552]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.572 --> 00:51:45.612]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.812 --> 00:51:46.533]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.553 --> 00:51:47.673]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[00:51:47.993 --> 00:51:52.514]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:52:05.527 --> 00:52:06.047]  are located?

[00:53:05.243 --> 00:53:10.244]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[00:53:10.644 --> 00:53:15.805]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:53:16.025 --> 00:53:16.605]  Here's why.
[00:53:16.805 --> 00:53:25.247]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home with
[00:53:25.247 --> 00:53:25.527]  I think so.
[00:53:44.915 --> 00:53:45.536]  I think so.
[00:54:16.118 --> 00:54:18.301]  I don't know.
[00:54:36.604 --> 00:54:44.668]  Continuing with wide open telephones, tons of news and information, medical news, war news, economy news I haven't even gotten to yet in the second hour.
[00:54:44.768 --> 00:54:47.489]  John in Texas, thanks for holding here on the air.
[00:54:47.509 --> 00:54:48.490]  Hi Alex.
[00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:49.030]  Hi.
[00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:51.871]  Always glad to talk to the Patriot Movement.
[00:54:52.832 --> 00:54:53.392]  Thank you, sir.
[00:54:54.112 --> 00:54:55.493]  I wanted to just make a brief statement.
[00:54:56.413 --> 00:54:56.954]  I'm a veteran.
[00:54:56.994 --> 00:54:57.814]  I fought in Vietnam.
[00:54:57.954 --> 00:54:59.855]  I got my draft notice in 1969.
[00:55:00.635 --> 00:55:03.357]  I was a dedicated conservative, anti-communist.
[00:55:03.417 --> 00:55:05.798]  I thought we were stopping a red menace in Vietnam.
[00:55:06.587 --> 00:55:08.968]  So I went over there, and the war had totally broke down.
[00:55:08.988 --> 00:55:09.848]  It was a total mess.
[00:55:10.128 --> 00:55:13.590]  A lot of stuff I'm seeing in Iraq was going on there as far as the crime and the corruption.
[00:55:13.770 --> 00:55:19.332]  They fund the warlords on Iraq to keep it going, and I've talked to the special forces commanders.
[00:55:20.732 --> 00:55:23.193]  Anyway, I came back totally disillusioned.
[00:55:23.533 --> 00:55:30.596]  I got hold of a book, I think it was by Anthony Sutton, called Red Carpet, that said that communism was a fraud, that when they supposed enemies of communism,
[00:55:31.189 --> 00:55:32.670]  I landed in Moscow or Peking.
[00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.752]  It was like open arms, hugs and kisses.
[00:55:34.852 --> 00:55:37.213]  Absolute declassified fact.
[00:55:37.454 --> 00:55:42.717]  When Shutton wrote that, he was going off of internal documents, because he'd been in Congress, worked in Congress with people there.
[00:55:43.178 --> 00:55:45.880]  Now it's even on History Channel that our government put Mao in.
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.280]  Go ahead.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:54.005]  But anyway, so anyway, I started listening to, after I read that book, I started listening to a Jewish commentator for the John Birch Society, Alan Stang.
[00:55:54.506 --> 00:55:57.768]  And for him, I got educated about the New World Order, and I joined the society.
[00:55:57.808 --> 00:55:58.989]  I was in it for a number of years.
[00:55:59.782 --> 00:56:01.403]  And so I pretty much know what's going on.
[00:56:02.003 --> 00:56:11.287]  But my question to you is, don't you think that the Ron Paul candidacy is going to prove whether the Infowars is a success or a failure if you don't make it?
[00:56:17.356 --> 00:56:18.859]  It's already a success, sir.
[00:56:18.939 --> 00:56:22.044]  Breaking the all-time campaign money raise.
[00:56:22.104 --> 00:56:24.207]  It shows us we can get grassroots movements.
[00:56:24.287 --> 00:56:31.759]  It shows us we have huge grassroots support for a candidate who's anti-UN, anti-Federal Reserve, pro-US, pro-border.
[00:56:32.655 --> 00:56:34.477]  It shows we're the majority.
[00:56:34.517 --> 00:56:37.159]  He's got liberals, conservatives, libertarians supporting him.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:42.564]  The left is waking up and buying guns and finding out about big government working for corporations.
[00:56:42.604 --> 00:56:43.885]  The paradigm is being shattered.
[00:56:44.126 --> 00:56:51.012]  For the first time in modern history, over a hundred years, both parties are out of favor with an 11% approval rating each in Congress.
[00:56:51.744 --> 00:56:54.887]  Sir, just because we try, we win.
[00:56:55.148 --> 00:56:57.650]  Just because we move the ball down the field, we win.
[00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:59.652]  Regardless, he injects real issues.
[00:56:59.692 --> 00:57:00.573]  We've already won.
[00:57:01.013 --> 00:57:05.178]  I got my bumper stickers on my car, and I got my Ron Paul sign in the front yard.
[00:57:05.358 --> 00:57:13.366]  Ron Paul is like a Marine Corps force recon camp, basically, who just makes us grow our muscles.
[00:57:14.226 --> 00:57:15.327]  We have become atrophied.
[00:57:15.367 --> 00:57:16.728]  We hadn't been politically involved.
[00:57:16.748 --> 00:57:17.768]  We hadn't been informed.
[00:57:18.389 --> 00:57:22.511]  If Ron Paul doesn't win, we grew the movement.
[00:57:22.931 --> 00:57:23.852]  We grew the muscles.
[00:57:24.452 --> 00:57:25.853]  I've been involved in politics.
[00:57:25.893 --> 00:57:27.133]  I met Ronald Reagan personally.
[00:57:29.099 --> 00:57:34.923]  And I dropped out, I got disillusioned, but I'm back in now, and I'm going to get on my knees and pray that we're going to be successful with Ron Paul.
[00:57:34.943 --> 00:57:36.645]  Good job, sir, and God bless you.
[00:57:36.665 --> 00:57:39.447]  Your service to this country is not lessened by the fact that it was a fraud.
[00:57:39.827 --> 00:57:44.510]  You thought you were fighting for this country and liberty and freedom, and again, we just salute all of our veterans out there.
[00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:45.851]  Here's another analogy.
[00:57:45.911 --> 00:57:47.232]  Let's say it's your first marathon.
[00:57:47.252 --> 00:57:49.053]  You've been training for it for three or four months.
[00:57:49.734 --> 00:57:51.635]  You run 20 of the 23 miles.
[00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:57.519]  You twist your ankle on the 20th mile, and you've got to limp off and get somebody to give you a ride back to your car.
[00:57:58.627 --> 00:57:59.667]  Now, did you fail?
[00:57:59.948 --> 00:58:01.388]  Did you not do a good job?
[00:58:01.408 --> 00:58:02.208]  Did you lose?
[00:58:02.688 --> 00:58:03.549]  No, you won!
[00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:05.149]  You ran 20 miles!
[00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:13.172]  You know, people think they can't quit smoking cigarettes or quit drinking because, well, I only quit for a month and I went back on it.
[00:58:13.532 --> 00:58:14.613]  At least you tried.
[00:58:15.193 --> 00:58:16.954]  Trying is what it's all about.
[00:58:17.454 --> 00:58:22.616]  Getting on the field, taking action, putting your helmet on and hitting them hard every play.
[00:58:23.096 --> 00:58:26.297]  That's what matters and you will develop into Liberty champions
[00:58:27.077 --> 00:58:29.698]  You will have victories if you just keep trying.
[00:58:30.098 --> 00:58:36.020]  You know, we lost the first dozen plus battles with the British, but we started winning them in the end.
[00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:37.880]  It's perseverance.
[00:58:38.281 --> 00:58:39.541]  It's perseverance.
[00:58:39.961 --> 00:58:45.863]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.783 --> 00:58:49.104]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:58.374 --> 00:58:59.035]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.676 --> 00:59:00.797]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.438 --> 00:59:02.539]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:04.021]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.782 --> 00:59:05.704]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.364 --> 00:59:10.009]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:14.595]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.067 --> 00:59:19.488]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[00:59:20.068 --> 00:59:27.510]  We are 500 miles towards reaching the enemy's gates, and if we get there, they will fall, they will be defeated, the New World Order will be exposed.
[00:59:28.011 --> 00:59:29.211]  People say, what are solutions?
[00:59:30.531 --> 00:59:31.932]  The first big solution is the
[00:59:34.008 --> 00:59:38.211]  Committees of Correspondence, as they did for more than a decade before the Revolutionary War started.
[00:59:38.271 --> 00:59:39.292]  But this is an info war.
[00:59:39.592 --> 00:59:41.293]  We're trying to avert physical conflict.
[00:59:41.653 --> 00:59:48.778]  But if the British come, and the modern New World Order comes, from the North, at Lexington and Concord, that won't be our choice.
[00:59:48.918 --> 00:59:55.342]  We choose the path of peace, and that has been the most victorious piece of passive resistance.
[00:59:56.023 --> 00:59:57.864]  But we simply move forward with the truth.
[00:59:57.904 --> 00:59:59.345]  We expose government-sponsored terror.
[00:59:59.605 --> 01:00:03.728]  We expose the private run-for-profit Federal Reserve, it's engineering the monetary collapse.
[01:00:04.288 --> 01:00:06.849]  We show how the wars are frauds with our own documents.
[01:00:06.929 --> 01:00:09.230]  We first have to educate the public.
[01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:15.352]  We're a long way into that process, but we've still got a long way to go in that process.
[01:00:15.392 --> 01:00:17.992]  And then I say, go join a Second Amendment group.
[01:00:18.012 --> 01:00:19.433]  Go join Gun Owners of America.
[01:00:20.695 --> 01:00:22.435]  Go join a land rights organization.
[01:00:22.475 --> 01:00:24.036]  Go join a group defending the border.
[01:00:25.196 --> 01:00:27.216]  Go, you know, defend, defend.
[01:00:27.836 --> 01:00:32.037]  Fight the Law of the Sea Treaty to take control of the ocean by the UN.
[01:00:32.117 --> 01:00:37.778]  Fight all these global taxes they're pushing, claiming it's an answer to man-made global warming, when it isn't.
[01:00:37.818 --> 01:00:40.199]  Whether even you believe it's man-made, their solutions don't do it.
[01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:43.880]  I'm doing everything I can.
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.840]  Politicians lie to you and give you some simple solution.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:50.141]  Raise taxes, cut taxes, support me, do this.
[01:00:51.363 --> 01:00:52.163]  Send me money!
[01:00:52.203 --> 01:00:53.024]  That's the solution!
[01:00:53.084 --> 01:00:53.724]  No, it's not!
[01:00:54.924 --> 01:01:00.926]  The solution is a wide-ranging awakening, and a wide-ranging assault on the New World Order.
[01:01:03.107 --> 01:01:05.168]  Before I go any further, I didn't plug this in the last hour.
[01:01:05.188 --> 01:01:08.569]  We're going to come back in the next segment, take calls, and get into a bunch of news I'll mention in a moment.
[01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:18.952]  But before we do that, Loose Change Final Cut is out for high-quality stream, and you can watch it several times in a week period at
[01:01:22.023 --> 01:01:23.684]  PrisonPlanet.com for $6.95.
[01:01:25.466 --> 01:01:27.567]  And it is not free yet on the web.
[01:01:27.627 --> 01:01:29.769]  Someday we might do that, but this had investors.
[01:01:30.209 --> 01:01:31.490]  This had other people involved.
[01:01:31.530 --> 01:01:32.711]  We bought all the footage.
[01:01:32.751 --> 01:01:34.393]  We made all these graphics.
[01:01:34.493 --> 01:01:37.415]  I mean, the graphics alone were like, wait till you see them.
[01:01:37.475 --> 01:01:39.176]  It's better than the stuff you see on Discovery Channel.
[01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:41.178]  I think it was like $40,000 or something.
[01:01:41.218 --> 01:01:42.699]  I mean, this was done legitimately.
[01:01:43.331 --> 01:01:43.751]  We're good to go!
[01:02:12.110 --> 01:02:16.512]  Yeah, there are four or five investors in this, and it took two years to make.
[01:02:16.632 --> 01:02:32.858]  All the airplanes, people flying around, events, all the interviews, having to pay for four people to live while they were doing this for two years, going and all the time spent getting footage, negotiating, buying it, all of this.
[01:02:33.478 --> 01:02:37.360]  Plus, it's an incredible film, and we as filmmakers deserve to be supported.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.101]  Please go to InfoWars.com and buy Endgame Blue
[01:02:44.263 --> 01:02:46.945]  We've got it as low as $10.95 apiece when you buy them in bulk.
[01:02:47.065 --> 01:02:48.966]  Give them as gifts this Christmas.
[01:02:49.246 --> 01:02:49.947]  People need to see this.
[01:02:49.987 --> 01:02:50.407]  Don't wait.
[01:02:50.447 --> 01:02:52.068]  Get it now and say, here's your present early.
[01:02:52.989 --> 01:02:53.549]  Here it is.
[01:02:54.429 --> 01:03:02.515]  Go buy Loose Change Final Cut at Infowars.com so that we can live to fight another day.
[01:03:02.555 --> 01:03:06.537]  You talk about solutions, it does come down to supporting people that make these films.
[01:03:06.557 --> 01:03:09.359]  This is a professionally done film.
[01:03:10.174 --> 01:03:12.276]  It blows away the first and second edition.
[01:03:12.357 --> 01:03:13.758]  It's a completely new film.
[01:03:14.379 --> 01:03:19.304]  So again, go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to go watch it online.
[01:03:20.325 --> 01:03:21.947]  It's $6.95.
[01:03:23.188 --> 01:03:26.011]  Or to get the DVD, it's $19.95.
[01:03:26.452 --> 01:03:27.473]  I suggest you do both.
[01:03:27.573 --> 01:03:28.454]  We need your support.
[01:03:28.534 --> 01:03:29.235]  Infowars.com
[01:03:31.792 --> 01:03:33.653]  And again, with Endgame, I'm crazy.
[01:03:33.733 --> 01:03:35.234]  I just put it out on Google for free.
[01:03:35.635 --> 01:03:36.835]  I do not own this whole film.
[01:03:36.956 --> 01:03:37.696]  I cannot do that.
[01:03:38.236 --> 01:03:41.178]  And so, anybody who's got it up there, we're having them all pulled down.
[01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:45.461]  And, uh, you know, we just can't do that at this time with the film.
[01:03:45.982 --> 01:03:46.282]  Okay?
[01:03:46.782 --> 01:03:47.383]  It's that simple.
[01:03:47.683 --> 01:03:48.503]  Go to the website.
[01:03:49.044 --> 01:03:49.704]  Buy the film.
[01:03:49.824 --> 01:03:53.307]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.447 --> 01:03:55.848]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:56.929 --> 01:03:57.950]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.690 --> 01:03:59.591]  In the near future.
[01:04:00.482 --> 01:04:02.843]  Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:03.564 --> 01:04:06.326]  It's known as the Bilderberg Division.
[01:04:06.386 --> 01:04:08.627]  Won't their objection be world domination?
[01:04:09.167 --> 01:04:11.629]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.369 --> 01:04:19.713]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.695 --> 01:04:27.658]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:28.158 --> 01:04:31.661]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:32.021 --> 01:04:34.543]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:34.583 --> 01:04:35.743]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.763 --> 01:04:36.504]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.544 --> 01:04:37.605]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.805 --> 01:04:38.225]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.265 --> 01:04:39.806]  That's what they're after, usually.
[01:04:39.946 --> 01:04:44.489]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:05:49.555 --> 01:05:52.198]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:05:53.237 --> 01:05:55.579]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[01:05:55.679 --> 01:06:02.183]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[01:06:02.343 --> 01:06:05.465]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[01:06:05.665 --> 01:06:08.827]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[01:06:09.087 --> 01:06:11.729]  Assure that you and your family do not become a statistic.
[01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.211]  Introducing the Excalibur Dehydrator.

[01:06:50.999 --> 01:06:53.943]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:27.101 --> 01:07:28.342]  Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:28.642 --> 01:07:31.084]  Man, barely jumping back in my seat as the music ends.
[01:07:31.104 --> 01:07:33.786]  I'm doing ten things behind the scenes in each break.
[01:07:34.927 --> 01:07:37.088]  I actually gotta catch my breath here.
[01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:41.331]  Let's go ahead now and go to
[01:07:45.333 --> 01:07:47.014]  Rebecca in Canada, you're on the air.
[01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:47.674]  Thanks for holding.
[01:07:48.154 --> 01:07:49.695]  Hi, it's a pleasure to talk to you, Alex.
[01:07:49.935 --> 01:07:50.916]  Good to talk to you, Rebecca.
[01:07:51.456 --> 01:08:00.881]  I'm so grateful that you're finally the first opposition in the last 15,000 years towards these guys.
[01:08:01.221 --> 01:08:03.562]  I don't think I'm the first opposition towards the New World Order.
[01:08:04.903 --> 01:08:06.343]  You're the first vocal media.
[01:08:07.664 --> 01:08:08.664]  And I can't thank you enough.
[01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:13.587]  People up here in Canada, in Alberta, excuse me, I'm a little nervous.
[01:08:14.847 --> 01:08:16.969]  But people in Alberta are clueless.
[01:08:17.929 --> 01:08:18.610]  They have no idea.
[01:08:19.891 --> 01:08:22.513]  Well, that's why I say the solution is first informing.
[01:08:22.553 --> 01:08:24.695]  We haven't done that basic step yet.
[01:08:24.715 --> 01:08:26.456]  We haven't completed that job yet.
[01:08:26.756 --> 01:08:29.739]  And we'll never be totally done, but you wake the people up.
[01:08:29.819 --> 01:08:32.701]  Things will get fixed on their own by everybody taking action.
[01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:34.182]  But you have to first wake them up.
[01:08:34.462 --> 01:08:37.405]  Plus, who am I to say I have all the exact solutions?
[01:08:38.085 --> 01:08:39.526]  I'm not that heady or haughty.
[01:08:39.927 --> 01:08:43.910]  I'm saying that if you wake people up, then they can make decisions about what they should do.
[01:08:44.608 --> 01:08:50.554]  Well, what I've learned, just in the last couple of weeks, I'm not sure if you know Michael Therrien?
[01:08:51.735 --> 01:08:52.396]  Michael Therrien?
[01:08:52.456 --> 01:08:54.097]  He's mentioned you in his documentaries.
[01:08:55.519 --> 01:08:56.680]  Ah, the name rings a bell.
[01:08:57.461 --> 01:08:59.623]  Alright, well, he's called you the first opposition.
[01:08:59.643 --> 01:09:09.792]  The next video I watched was from the My In Calendar on Google Video, and it explains the cycle that we're in.
[01:09:11.011 --> 01:09:15.117]  Right now we're in, since February 1999, we've been in the galactic cycle.
[01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:19.984]  And the product of that is ethical considerations.
[01:09:20.004 --> 01:09:22.968]  So what have you noticed since January 1999?
[01:09:23.068 --> 01:09:27.715]  It's been happening to our heads of state, or leaders, or CEOs, or whatever.
[01:09:30.629 --> 01:09:31.890]  They've been getting exposed.
[01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:32.950]  Yeah.
[01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:38.313]  But I would add that even if all that Mayan calendar stuff isn't real, I don't know, it's pretty wild stuff.
[01:09:38.333 --> 01:09:41.534]  They were into mathematics and the stars and observatories and the rest of it.
[01:09:42.114 --> 01:09:46.156]  Even if that isn't real, the elite do believe in that and do believe it's real.
[01:09:46.496 --> 01:09:51.579]  And so regardless, they are manifesting in their actions according to those belief systems.
[01:09:51.759 --> 01:09:52.619]  So it is important.
[01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:53.740]  Know thy enemy.
[01:09:55.221 --> 01:09:58.042]  And take over because there's an ending to this ethical period.
[01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:01.233]  And that date is in February of 2011.
[01:10:01.933 --> 01:10:03.354]  And what supposedly happens then?
[01:10:03.374 --> 01:10:13.122]  The next stage is universal, or universal which lasts, it'll only last until February 10th, until the 2012 date.
[01:10:13.622 --> 01:10:15.944]  So it's about a one year cycle.
[01:10:16.624 --> 01:10:19.026]  Isn't that supposedly a big mass awakening time?
[01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:21.600]  Pretty much.
[01:10:21.680 --> 01:10:23.901]  And so the elite are trying to head us off at the pass.
[01:10:24.601 --> 01:10:28.682]  I don't know, I mean they've been saying that for over a hundred years and now it's all happening according to that date.
[01:10:29.042 --> 01:10:30.923]  I don't know, there's a lot of weird stuff going on.
[01:10:31.643 --> 01:10:32.543]  You play a role in this.
[01:10:33.403 --> 01:10:35.164]  You play, I'm shaking talking to you Alex.
[01:10:35.524 --> 01:10:36.424]  Oh please.
[01:10:36.724 --> 01:10:38.545]  No, I'm serious, alright?
[01:10:38.805 --> 01:10:42.306]  And I talk to people about it here, they think I'm crazy and I love it.
[01:10:43.546 --> 01:10:49.348]  Because I'm the only one that's going to know what's going to happen to Canada and North America.
[01:10:49.368 --> 01:10:50.568]  Because people are clueless here.
[01:10:51.485 --> 01:10:52.666]  Well, I know this, Rebecca.
[01:10:52.786 --> 01:11:02.172]  Regardless, we're going into very, very tumultuous, turbulent times with just great upthrust and collapses and just so many things happening.
[01:11:02.192 --> 01:11:03.353]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:11:05.775 --> 01:11:14.341]  Yeah, if people can just wake up and discover that they have the power, that they need to be cleansed.
[01:11:14.901 --> 01:11:20.725]  We can stop the emotional, you know, confrontation that we all want to bring out and it feels good bringing out, right?
[01:11:21.434 --> 01:11:25.895]  But if we can wake up to who we really are, and that we're the ones that we're waiting for.
[01:11:27.356 --> 01:11:27.876]  God bless you.
[01:11:27.896 --> 01:11:29.156]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:11:29.176 --> 01:11:31.757]  Yeah, I don't know about all that stuff.
[01:11:31.777 --> 01:11:37.959]  I know a lot of people believe in it, and I know the elite believe in it, and so we should certainly look at it because that's what they believe.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:44.141]  Let's go ahead and take another call from Jim in Mass.
[01:11:44.201 --> 01:11:44.981]  Jim, you're on the air.
[01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:45.381]  Go ahead.
[01:11:45.961 --> 01:11:47.001]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:11:47.041 --> 01:11:48.082]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:11:48.222 --> 01:11:48.702]  Thank you, Jim.
[01:11:49.308 --> 01:11:53.492]  I'm a pastor here in Massachusetts and I just want to make a quick comment.
[01:11:53.512 --> 01:12:01.237]  I know you have a lot of people waiting to speak with you and let you know something that's going on with the Second Amendment here in Massachusetts that you may not be aware of.
[01:12:01.258 --> 01:12:02.458]  You may be, but I don't know.
[01:12:03.239 --> 01:12:05.361]  But I want to thank you for opening my eyes.
[01:12:07.002 --> 01:12:12.907]  My church and myself pray for you every Sunday and what you're doing down there in Texas and across this world.
[01:12:12.967 --> 01:12:13.327]  Thank you.
[01:12:15.141 --> 01:12:16.483]  We think you're a great American.
[01:12:16.503 --> 01:12:19.806]  I think that should be stripped from Sean Hannity and relayed over to you.
[01:12:20.887 --> 01:12:22.308]  You really opened my eyes.
[01:12:22.488 --> 01:12:30.396]  As the scriptures say, the apostles even challenged people to not listen directly to what they were saying but go research it for themselves.
[01:12:30.516 --> 01:12:33.459]  That's exactly what I did when I first heard you.
[01:12:34.239 --> 01:12:35.661]  Everything that you say is true.
[01:12:36.300 --> 01:12:43.206]  My battle cry has become to the Christian community is stop being sheep, stop drinking the Kool-Aid, and open your eyes to what's going on.
[01:12:43.346 --> 01:13:02.823]  Did you hear last week when Hagee, the third biggest preacher in the country, and I was walking by TVs on last night at the radio station, they've got like 12 TVs or more, this is, they've got like 10 in one room and a couple in another and a couple in the other, and I saw Hagee on History Channel, you know, putting out his propaganda, but did you hear when Hagee said that Jesus wasn't the Messiah?
[01:13:03.434 --> 01:13:06.296]  Oh, absolutely, and that's an anathema.
[01:13:06.336 --> 01:13:10.159]  I mean, that's sacrilege for what he said.
[01:13:10.179 --> 01:13:17.545]  And Diarrhea actually brought that up on the pulpit on Sunday morning and a couple of people got ready to head for the door and I said, well, wait a minute here.
[01:13:17.585 --> 01:13:22.229]  I said, I'll tell you what, in the next week I'll work on getting a copy of that recording and I'll play it for you.
[01:13:23.306 --> 01:13:27.990]  They can go to YouTube and type in Pastor Hagee, Christ Not Messiah.
[01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:31.693]  They can go to his website and he's got the video on his website.
[01:13:32.494 --> 01:13:38.358]  But you know people say, oh that can't be, afterwards after our service people come up to me and say, oh that can't be true.
[01:13:38.398 --> 01:13:39.459]  He would never say anything like that.
[01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:43.542]  And it can't be true that Pat Robertson just endorsed Giuliani, right?
[01:13:43.582 --> 01:13:51.609]  Well yeah, I mean I called CBN and I asked to speak with somebody on that because I said I'm a pastor and we've supported you in the past but we're not giving you another dime.
[01:13:52.202 --> 01:14:00.904]  And I said, I'd like to speak to somebody about this, and they put me off to somebody in public relations, and they took down my name and phone number and never got a return phone call back.
[01:14:01.244 --> 01:14:03.724]  Well, they had a press conference last Thursday.
[01:14:04.464 --> 01:14:11.386]  You can go watch it, and he says, well, the abortion thing, that's not as important as the Islamofascist.
[01:14:11.846 --> 01:14:18.927]  Right, absolutely, and you know, it's very disheartening, especially when you're a member of the clergy, to hear somebody else that a lot of people look up to and
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:31.887]  You know, again, they're trying to do it very subtly, and again, unfortunately, Christians are sheep, and I tell my congregation that all the time, and they get very offended at it, but I said, you know, I was a sheep, too, just because I'm a shepherd of the flock.
[01:14:31.967 --> 01:14:36.129]  I was a sheep, too, for a while, until I opened my eyes, and I said, please, just do your research.
[01:14:36.169 --> 01:14:44.934]  But, you know, the big thing is, I think people are being enslaved by their finances, that people don't have time to do any of this, because they're just trying to keep their head above water.
[01:14:44.974 --> 01:14:50.478]  Well, I know it's scary as a pastor to see people walking out, but that means you're doing the right thing if it's causing people to be concerned.
[01:14:50.778 --> 01:15:03.688]  You don't want to go to a church where it's all just happy, lovey-dovey, and there's nothing to do, and no challenge, and the disciples and the prophets were always causing big, tumultuous things, and we're always having people get mad at them.
[01:15:04.309 --> 01:15:06.811]  The world's not supposed to love us, as you know, Pastor.
[01:15:07.191 --> 01:15:07.611]  Absolutely.
[01:15:10.399 --> 01:15:11.019]  You can.
[01:15:11.639 --> 01:15:12.760]  I'm sure you've got a computer.
[01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.600]  Steve Watson wrote an article.
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:17.161]  Let me just go to the main page of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:17.901 --> 01:15:18.922]  Let me look for it here.
[01:15:19.342 --> 01:15:19.762]  Here it is.
[01:15:19.842 --> 01:15:21.622]  Fake Christians Expose Themselves.
[01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.483]  You go to PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:23.543 --> 01:15:24.203]  Right-hand side.
[01:15:24.243 --> 01:15:24.963]  News and Focus.
[01:15:25.644 --> 01:15:29.385]  And for some reason, Steve didn't even write about the Jesus isn't the Messiah clip.
[01:15:29.425 --> 01:15:31.685]  He just talked about Pat Robertson and Hagee.
[01:15:32.686 --> 01:15:34.086]  But down here is the clip.
[01:15:34.186 --> 01:15:35.947]  In fact, let's just play that clip.
[01:15:36.167 --> 01:15:36.887]  Pastor, God bless you.
[01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:37.407]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:37.747 --> 01:15:38.608]  People can't believe it.
[01:15:39.028 --> 01:15:39.948]  Dig that clip up, John.
[01:15:41.423 --> 01:15:42.084]  Here's Hagee.
[01:15:42.124 --> 01:15:43.085]  This is unedited.
[01:15:43.446 --> 01:15:45.548]  People emailed us saying it was fake audio.
[01:15:45.648 --> 01:15:52.136]  Folks, whenever Dick Cheney came out and said he was a secret member of the CFR and kept it secret, people thought that was fake.
[01:15:52.176 --> 01:15:52.997]  It was on C-SPAN.
[01:15:53.417 --> 01:15:54.739]  You can go watch the video.
[01:15:54.779 --> 01:15:56.000]  Some of them apologized after.
[01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:57.802]  We're not making this up.
[01:15:57.863 --> 01:15:58.684]  He really said this.
[01:15:58.724 --> 01:15:58.984]  Listen.
[01:16:00.131 --> 01:16:03.272]  I'm delighted to present my latest book, In Defense of Israel.
[01:16:03.712 --> 01:16:08.013]  This book will expose the sins of the fathers and the vicious abuse of the Jewish people.
[01:16:08.613 --> 01:16:11.414]  In Defense of Israel will shape Christian theology.
[01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:16.876]  It scripturally proves that the Jewish people as a whole did not reject Jesus as Messiah.
[01:16:17.456 --> 01:16:21.017]  It will also prove that Jesus did not come to earth to be the Messiah.
[01:16:21.757 --> 01:16:30.520]  It will prove that there was a Calvary conspiracy between Rome, the High Priest, and Herod to execute Jesus as an insurrectionist too dangerous to live.
[01:16:31.140 --> 01:16:38.602]  Since Jesus refused by word and deed to claim to be the Messiah, how can the Jews be blamed for rejecting what was never offered?
[01:16:39.162 --> 01:16:42.506]  Read it in the shocking expose in defense of Israel.
[01:16:43.046 --> 01:16:48.732]  This latest book by Pastor John Hagee is destined to generate lively discussions among Christians the world over.
[01:16:48.953 --> 01:16:51.715]  Yes, lively discussions.
[01:16:52.456 --> 01:16:54.378]  No, people are just going to say it isn't real.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:17:01.466]  But then when they see him give a whole sermon on it, which we've now found, they will say it is of the Lord.
[01:17:02.897 --> 01:17:08.140]  That's what people who are... Now, again, if you're not a Christian, you think we're all a bunch of nuts, whatever.
[01:17:08.161 --> 01:17:10.122]  This is not a religious show, but I am a Christian.
[01:17:10.142 --> 01:17:11.663]  I make no bones about it.
[01:17:11.703 --> 01:17:12.183]  I'm proud of it.
[01:17:12.623 --> 01:17:15.685]  But I'm not one of these fake pulpiteers, as my uncle calls them.
[01:17:16.906 --> 01:17:30.835]  And, you know, the fact you have the third biggest preacher in the country, and you have the biggest, you can debate whether it's Dobson or Pat Robertson, but I would say Pat Robertson has more money, more TV stations, more influence.
[01:17:31.701 --> 01:17:39.847]  It probably goes Robertson, Dobbs, Dr. Dobson, and then, of course, Hagee.
[01:17:41.508 --> 01:17:43.750]  And, you know, he is a far third from those big two.
[01:17:44.870 --> 01:17:56.879]  But to have the biggest preacher endorse Giuliani, who's pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, and again, I'm just totally politically looking at this and analyzing it, that just shows a major break and a major shift.
[01:17:59.292 --> 01:18:03.915]  And then to have Hagee saying Jesus isn't the Messiah, didn't come as the Messiah.
[01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:05.415]  That's a big deal, folks.
[01:18:05.435 --> 01:18:06.876]  That's earth-shaking.
[01:18:07.777 --> 01:18:09.117]  And what does the flock do?
[01:18:09.157 --> 01:18:17.462]  They are so brainwashed that they attack myself, they attack the pastor, Jim and Mass, that you just heard.
[01:18:17.542 --> 01:18:18.642]  I mean, look, I'm sorry.
[01:18:19.843 --> 01:18:22.144]  But you have got the facts here.
[01:18:22.224 --> 01:18:27.087]  Pastor, I tell you, bring a laptop in, load it up on the screen, put it up on your pulpit,
[01:18:28.072 --> 01:18:30.475]  Open it to full screen and just play it over and over again to them.
[01:18:32.197 --> 01:18:36.341]  So, we're going to come back, get into some news, then more ear calls.
[01:18:37.202 --> 01:18:40.285]  Denise, Dan, Nathan, and many others, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:18:41.086 --> 01:18:45.951]  I'm going to get into cell phone tower radiation, cell phones themselves.
[01:18:46.272 --> 01:18:48.935]  I've talked about this, read a lot of articles, but I haven't really detailed it.
[01:18:49.195 --> 01:18:50.096]  We will be detailing it.
[01:18:55.436 --> 01:18:56.739]  Tidin is for Midas November 12, 2007.
[01:18:56.819 --> 01:19:00.004]  Gold 807 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $831.50, $409.80 for half, $204.90 for quarter.
[01:19:00.025 --> 01:19:00.525]  That's $831.50, $409.80 and $204.90.
[01:19:07.299 --> 01:19:13.402]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[01:19:13.482 --> 01:19:17.884]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the Yan Revolution.
[01:19:18.204 --> 01:19:26.849]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[01:19:26.889 --> 01:19:29.510]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:33.772]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[01:19:33.992 --> 01:19:40.516]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published a report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[01:19:40.856 --> 01:19:44.478]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.518 --> 01:19:47.739]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:19:47.839 --> 01:19:48.119]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:48.139 --> 01:19:48.319]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.210 --> 01:19:54.690]  Hi, Ken.
[01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:55.510]  It's Judy again.
[01:19:55.530 --> 01:20:00.071]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:20:00.211 --> 01:20:03.352]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:20:03.572 --> 01:20:05.452]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:20:05.732 --> 01:20:07.813]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:20:07.993 --> 01:20:14.094]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:20:14.294 --> 01:20:19.595]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:20:19.855 --> 01:20:22.696]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:20:22.836 --> 01:20:23.756]  Go KenSolar!
[01:20:25.066 --> 01:20:26.587]  Get the best of both worlds.

[01:20:54.267 --> 01:20:57.588]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:20:57.928 --> 01:21:04.830]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:21:05.210 --> 01:21:17.693]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:21:17.933 --> 01:21:20.574]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:21:20.914 --> 01:21:27.117]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:21:27.357 --> 01:21:32.499]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:21:32.739 --> 01:21:41.003]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:21:41.203 --> 01:21:41.843]  And the best part?
[01:21:42.063 --> 01:21:44.084]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:21:44.344 --> 01:21:46.587]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:21:53.718 --> 01:21:57.979]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:21:58.239 --> 01:22:03.100]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:04.661]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:22:04.841 --> 01:22:08.201]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:22:28.632 --> 01:22:29.553]  No animal testing.

[01:23:15.435 --> 01:23:17.218]  People shuffling their feet.
[01:23:17.238 --> 01:23:18.921]  People sleeping in their shoes.
[01:23:19.061 --> 01:23:21.965]  There's a warning sign on the road, right?
[01:23:22.066 --> 01:23:25.311]  There's a lot of people saying it'd be better off empty.
[01:23:42.401 --> 01:23:43.942]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:23:44.322 --> 01:23:45.363]  until 2 p.m.
[01:23:46.744 --> 01:23:48.005]  Central Standard Time.
[01:23:48.045 --> 01:23:49.946]  We're here live, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:50.547 --> 01:23:53.309]  The network retransmits us 9 to midnight Central.
[01:23:54.941 --> 01:24:00.523]  If you are a listener at work overnight, or if you listen, say, 7 a.m., 10 a.m.
[01:24:00.543 --> 01:24:03.244]  in the morning, or you want to listen at 3 p.m.
[01:24:03.304 --> 01:24:12.187]  Central, whenever you want to tune in, we have streams every day for 21 hours after each live show until the next live show starts up.
[01:24:12.868 --> 01:24:14.868]  And then Fridays when the show ends at 2 p.m.
[01:24:14.908 --> 01:24:17.269]  Central, it restreams until 4 p.m.
[01:24:17.309 --> 01:24:19.650]  Central when I do the Sunday live show for two hours.
[01:24:20.473 --> 01:24:31.382]  Then that consecutively restreams at Infowars.com and TrisNews.us until I go live on Monday morning at 11 a.m.
[01:24:31.442 --> 01:24:33.944]  Central or High Noon Eastern.
[01:24:35.645 --> 01:24:37.707]  And I want to thank all of you that do listen to the show.
[01:24:37.727 --> 01:24:43.011]  I want to thank all of you that have told your friends, family, neighbors, people in your community, pastors who listen to the show.
[01:24:43.551 --> 01:24:46.494]  I don't know why, but I'm able to wake people up.
[01:24:46.514 --> 01:24:47.775]  I'm able to reach out to people.
[01:24:49.089 --> 01:24:52.732]  And we're able to really wake people up when other folks haven't been as successful.
[01:24:53.512 --> 01:24:56.474]  But then other people are successful at waking folks up that I'm not successful at.
[01:24:57.375 --> 01:24:58.736]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:24:59.116 --> 01:25:01.197]  We just covered the facts here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:01.557 --> 01:25:04.299]  And again, I am humbled and honored to be your host.
[01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.641]  We also have the free podcast at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:07.701 --> 01:25:14.666]  Each show, six days a week, the six shows we do a week, streamed out to you, free, to your MP3 or iPod device.
[01:25:14.686 --> 01:25:15.907]  So if you haven't subscribed to that,
[01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:16.884]  I think so.
[01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:47.287]  Oh, it's so good to just stop at red lights, or at the grocery store, or at your church, or wherever, and say, hey, tune in to this station, tune in to that station, whatever station is carrying us.
[01:25:47.427 --> 01:25:58.632]  Or if a station is carrying a similar broadcast that supports Ron Paul, or is fighting the New World Order, or if you've got a local pastor on the radio fighting the New World Order, there are some of those out there, quite a few.
[01:25:58.652 --> 01:25:59.652]  Tell people about that show.
[01:26:00.553 --> 01:26:05.775]  Or David J. Smith, or Tex Mars, or any of the other programs that are on out there that are doing a good job.
[01:26:07.654 --> 01:26:09.836]  Talk of worst recession since 1930s.
[01:26:09.936 --> 01:26:12.878]  This is on to the New York Sun today.
[01:26:14.219 --> 01:26:22.406]  After what Los Angeles money manager Arnold Silver called a brutal three days, the question is, what now for the market?
[01:26:24.167 --> 01:26:26.469]  We'll give you market numbers when we get back, late in the day.
[01:26:28.090 --> 01:26:31.053]  A Wall Street superstar this year who runs
[01:26:32.330 --> 01:26:39.253]  That's what the former Treasury head and of course the father of economics and Wall Street Journal editor said here last week.
[01:26:40.174 --> 01:26:41.014]  He said, worldwide depression.
[01:26:49.631 --> 01:26:50.311]  Let me go back.
[01:26:50.771 --> 01:26:51.812]  Worried about a recession.
[01:26:51.892 --> 01:26:53.493]  Not a normal one, but a very bad one.
[01:26:53.873 --> 01:26:55.073]  The worst since the 1930s.
[01:26:55.773 --> 01:27:01.335]  I expect we'll see clear signs of it in six months with a dramatic slowdown in gross domestic product.
[01:27:01.355 --> 01:27:03.156]  See, I said middle of next year.
[01:27:03.696 --> 01:27:04.577]  Middle of next year.
[01:27:05.077 --> 01:27:07.338]  Because I'm reading what market analysts are saying.
[01:27:08.238 --> 01:27:20.563]  Not just in housing, or not just in corporate paper, but in gold stocks, in gold itself going up by then, over 2,000, they're talking about what the central banks are saying, what the exchequer is saying.
[01:27:21.203 --> 01:27:24.164]  Six months from now is the key.
[01:27:24.904 --> 01:27:32.627]  We'll know, according to all the experts, we'll know if we're going to have a bad recession or a depression, okay?
[01:27:36.369 --> 01:27:38.631]  Not a normal recession, but a very bad one.
[01:27:38.691 --> 01:27:39.752]  The worst since the 1930s.
[01:27:40.372 --> 01:27:45.356]  I expect we'll see clear signs of it in six months with a dramatic slowdown in the gross domestic product.
[01:27:46.437 --> 01:27:48.298]  Ballester Capital, a $350 million New York hedge fund, was up 3%.
[01:27:53.129 --> 01:28:07.184]  In the past three market sessions with the Dow Jones Industrials, spearheaded by widespread declines in financial stocks and fears of more million-dollar-plus asset write-downs, tumbled more than 677 points, or 4.5 percent.
[01:28:07.485 --> 01:28:14.652]  The Nasdaq fared worse, skidding about 7 percent, triggered by across-the-board declines in those
[01:28:16.664 --> 01:28:18.025]  Stepping Technology Stocks.
[01:28:18.466 --> 01:28:22.509]  I'll cover financial portion of the news for the day when we get back.
[01:28:22.990 --> 01:28:39.966]  Then I'll take a gamut of calls, and then we'll get back into the world news, the war news, the police state news briefly, and then I'm going to spend the lion's share on frequency pollution, the radiating of America.
[01:28:40.486 --> 01:28:41.347]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.312 --> 01:28:47.334]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.414 --> 01:28:51.135]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.257 --> 01:28:55.698]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[01:29:59.612 --> 01:30:03.838]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:30:04.278 --> 01:30:11.128]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:30:11.548 --> 01:30:18.271]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:30:18.591 --> 01:30:20.192]  There are no reported side effects.

[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:11.463]  Man, he's playing Dixie.
[01:32:11.523 --> 01:32:14.186]  Man, that is Hannah Smith.
[01:32:14.346 --> 01:32:16.048]  Could be the viola.
[01:32:16.128 --> 01:32:19.393]  Could be the low-carb beat.
[01:32:36.545 --> 01:32:37.707]  Oh, Satan!
[01:33:02.899 --> 01:33:04.179]  Listen to him!
[01:33:33.681 --> 01:33:34.182]  Welcome back.
[01:33:34.202 --> 01:33:35.182]  Alright, your calls are coming up.
[01:33:35.202 --> 01:33:36.463]  I want to get into financial news.
[01:33:36.623 --> 01:33:38.825]  But I'm telling you, there's something coming up this weekend.
[01:33:39.185 --> 01:33:47.352]  You want to attend, especially if you're in Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Missouri, Kansas.
[01:33:48.493 --> 01:33:49.614]  Drive down to Dallas.
[01:33:49.694 --> 01:33:50.815]  Very nice hotel.
[01:33:51.415 --> 01:33:53.096]  Very inexpensive for three days.
[01:33:54.818 --> 01:33:55.819]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:33:55.879 --> 01:33:57.480]  I haven't been to these, and I wish I could go.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.942]  I've talked to so many people that have, like the Loose Change crew.
[01:34:00.002 --> 01:34:01.023]  Burmese is going to be down there.
[01:34:02.409 --> 01:34:11.855]  That is the LiveFreeNow.org Freedom Law School 2007 Texas Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference on the 16th, 17th, and 18th.
[01:34:11.895 --> 01:34:12.635]  It's almost here.
[01:34:12.675 --> 01:34:13.796]  Get your tickets now.
[01:34:14.116 --> 01:34:14.997]  Give them a call at 972-980-8877.

[01:34:43.406 --> 01:34:46.989]  And on top of that, I want to tell you about the Debtor's Secret Weapon.
[01:34:47.009 --> 01:34:47.970]  It's a thick book.
[01:34:48.130 --> 01:34:49.091]  Easy read, though.
[01:34:50.372 --> 01:34:53.855]  I thought, because of the name of the website, oh, this is, no, I'm not going to take that sponsor.
[01:34:53.895 --> 01:34:55.556]  And they just said, please read the book.
[01:34:56.077 --> 01:34:58.759]  And I went, my gosh, this is excellent information.

[01:35:24.068 --> 01:35:26.592]  All of that spot check was excellent info, but I did read the book.
[01:35:26.752 --> 01:35:28.394]  It's worth it right there alone.
[01:35:28.474 --> 01:35:29.015]  Give them a call.
[01:35:29.035 --> 01:35:29.075]  877-327-0365.
[01:35:29.095 --> 01:35:30.938]  877-327-0365 or out in 90.com, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:31.318]  All right.
[01:35:40.349 --> 01:35:47.674]  That said, Loose Change Final Cut is out, available for high quality, super high quality flash stream.
[01:35:47.694 --> 01:35:54.759]  Go watch the different trailers up on PrisonPlanet.com to get an idea of the quality you're going to be watching, and it's even better than that.
[01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:58.442]  And get it, $6.95, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:59.362 --> 01:36:01.324]  And also, by you getting it, I won't go to the poorhouse.
[01:36:02.877 --> 01:36:05.279]  And get the DVD as well.
[01:36:05.739 --> 01:36:07.960]  Loose Change, Final Cut, completely new film.
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:09.521]  Indescribably good.
[01:36:09.581 --> 01:36:15.484]  Dylan Avery, a real savant when it comes to putting these type things together.
[01:36:16.025 --> 01:36:18.026]  And I just, it is the preeminent 9-11 film.
[01:36:18.046 --> 01:36:20.307]  It even dwarfs Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:36:20.347 --> 01:36:21.728]  You can also call toll free to get it.
[01:36:21.748 --> 01:36:22.088]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:22.108 --> 01:36:23.829]  You can call and get in game with it.
[01:36:28.231 --> 01:36:29.732]  We don't discount the loose change.
[01:36:29.752 --> 01:36:31.434]  We do discount the endgame when you get it with it.
[01:36:32.194 --> 01:36:34.156]  So you can get endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:36:34.196 --> 01:36:35.937]  These are perfect stocking stuffers.
[01:36:36.297 --> 01:36:37.218]  Perfect for Christmas.
[01:36:37.258 --> 01:36:37.819]  But don't wait.
[01:36:37.879 --> 01:36:40.100]  Say, here's your Christmas present early.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:40.681]  Loose change.
[01:36:40.861 --> 01:36:41.622]  The final cut.
[01:36:41.762 --> 01:36:44.384]  An endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:36:44.724 --> 01:36:46.946]  Giving the New World Order twin black eyes.
[01:36:47.766 --> 01:36:49.527]  I am excited about this.
[01:36:49.727 --> 01:37:00.072]  So again, get your Loose Change Final Cut on DVD or see it online right now at LooseChangeTheFinalCut.com or link through at PrisonPlanet.com or TruthNews.us.
[01:37:00.392 --> 01:37:00.933]  One more plug...
[01:37:01.778 --> 01:37:15.683]  Well, before I forget, tomorrow, 5 o'clock, downtown Austin, 6th and Lamar, Waterloo Records and Video, and right next door is their nice restaurant, Waterloo Ice House.
[01:37:15.723 --> 01:37:16.423]  I like to eat there.
[01:37:16.443 --> 01:37:17.723]  I may even eat something there afterwards.
[01:37:18.744 --> 01:37:20.464]  But maybe we'll all go invade there after.
[01:37:20.484 --> 01:37:28.367]  But I'm going to give a speech at 5, about 545, and sign endgames for an hour and 15 minutes or so, and then I'll make the jump into hyperspace.
[01:37:29.087 --> 01:37:31.208]  But I do hope to see you there tomorrow.
[01:37:32.589 --> 01:37:35.270]  And details and address up on whatistheendgame.com.
[01:37:37.170 --> 01:37:41.992]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, let me get back into the financial news now.
[01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:45.953]  Let me try to calmly go over this.
[01:37:49.954 --> 01:37:51.455]  Look at the New York Siren headline.
[01:37:51.635 --> 01:37:58.077]  And I literally have more than 20 financial articles I printed yesterday and today on this very subject with other top financial experts saying the same thing.
[01:37:59.531 --> 01:38:11.558]  Now, I've been saying for about three months that it looks like we're going to find out if it's a huge recession, a deep recession, we've entered about a year ago, or if it's going to be an all-out depression.
[01:38:11.618 --> 01:38:24.806]  Now, the difference is soup kitchens, people running around wild in the streets, banks going bust, and there's already having runs on banks all over the place in Europe and the U.S., England, China, other places, and this is serious.
[01:38:26.041 --> 01:38:30.682]  We'll know whether it's... I never thought I'd pray for a recession, but it's from bad to worse.
[01:38:30.722 --> 01:38:32.543]  I'll take bad rather than worse here.
[01:38:33.303 --> 01:38:45.966]  And I think it's the first time in about a month that I didn't wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning and freaking out over this.
[01:38:46.066 --> 01:38:49.827]  I finally last night slept like a log, like I always slept in the past.
[01:38:52.607 --> 01:38:55.108]  Maybe it's because I was remembering my parents and got in their hot tub.
[01:38:57.287 --> 01:38:59.068]  I'm like a noodle, man, I gotta get one of those.
[01:39:00.289 --> 01:39:03.911]  But, alright, I'm already digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:06.132 --> 01:39:12.235]  The point is, this is, well, remember last Friday, we posted the article on Prison Planet from a Thursday interview, very important.
[01:39:12.275 --> 01:39:15.237]  Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts, I said, could it cause a worldwide depression?
[01:39:15.277 --> 01:39:16.318]  He said, worse than that.
[01:39:17.839 --> 01:39:22.141]  Complete world financial collapse of currencies and barter, a barter system.
[01:39:23.519 --> 01:39:29.723]  Okay, now this is one of the chief economists alive today, one of the top ten economists alive today saying that.
[01:39:30.183 --> 01:39:35.566]  Now here is another big wig, New York Sun, talk of worst recession since 1930.
[01:39:37.527 --> 01:39:43.650]  But the 1930s was not a recession, it was a deep ten-year depression from 1929 until 1939.
[01:39:48.170 --> 01:40:02.580]  The bottom was the winner of 33 in the War Powers Act and the rest of it, the full federalization of this country, and now in hindsight it's all declassified, admitted that that was staged.
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:03.521]  A consolidation.
[01:40:03.541 --> 01:40:07.184]  They've got to blow the economy out to really consolidate and get the middle class wealth.
[01:40:11.287 --> 01:40:13.028]  And so they're saying here that
[01:40:13.932 --> 01:40:22.274]  By the fifth month of next year, we should know whether it is going to be a mega-recession or just a recession.
[01:40:22.354 --> 01:40:24.334]  So that's the New York Sun saying exactly what I'm saying.
[01:40:24.594 --> 01:40:26.295]  And again, it's not like I'm going, ooh, look, I'm smart.
[01:40:26.735 --> 01:40:32.656]  This is what actual financial publications that analysts and people on the inside read.
[01:40:32.676 --> 01:40:34.757]  They're all public, but very few read them.
[01:40:35.797 --> 01:40:40.778]  You watch MSNBC, CNBC, CNN Financial, you get a pap.
[01:40:41.833 --> 01:40:42.754]  We're good to go.
[01:41:07.867 --> 01:41:08.767]  Sometimes I wish I didn't.
[01:41:08.787 --> 01:41:14.388]  It's a great responsibility, but it probably adds to the severity of things that I'm on air every day saying curtains.
[01:41:15.528 --> 01:41:19.389]  But that's what all the evidence shows, so I hope this doesn't happen.
[01:41:19.409 --> 01:41:20.289]  I hope it's just a recession.
[01:41:20.609 --> 01:41:27.470]  But I have a responsibility to you, my listeners, to just tell you what I think's going on, to tell you what my brain and intellect and my research says.
[01:41:28.391 --> 01:41:30.351]  And I... This could happen any day.
[01:41:30.471 --> 01:41:35.952]  When the public finally figures this out, the slide is already at Mach 10, hair on fire.
[01:41:36.773 --> 01:41:41.258]  But it's going to light speed and then warp speed when the public finds out.
[01:41:41.298 --> 01:41:43.500]  I mean, you could go into banks going bust overnight.
[01:41:44.421 --> 01:41:48.505]  In a week, we could go from just a recession that they still don't want to admit we're in.
[01:41:48.525 --> 01:41:52.309]  They're now starting to say, OK, we've been in one maybe for a year, a light recession that may deepen.
[01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:56.053]  The minute the public figures this out, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:41:57.637 --> 01:42:10.600]  We're literally sitting on top 20 tons of TNT, big barrels of black powder and plastic explosives and huge vats of nitroglycerin and the New World Order is cat dancing on top of it.
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.101]  And dancing around with waving sparklers in their hands.
[01:42:16.121 --> 01:42:17.922]  I mean that's basically what's happening.
[01:42:19.482 --> 01:42:21.802]  And I'm just looking at it in abject horror.
[01:42:23.203 --> 01:42:23.443]  So...
[01:42:24.602 --> 01:42:39.032]  I don't know when it's going to explode, or maybe you can dance around tap dancing naked with sparklers in your hands on top of a warehouse of TNT, and dynamite fuses sticking out like a prairie.
[01:42:40.413 --> 01:42:44.335]  I mean, that's literally... Alright, enough of the analogies.
[01:42:44.375 --> 01:42:45.096]  I'm out of control.
[01:42:45.116 --> 01:42:47.437]  Just analogy after analogy.
[01:42:47.557 --> 01:42:48.898]  I'm bad.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.902]  The mainstream news of the public's being fed is like this.
[01:42:58.804 --> 01:43:03.447]  And it sounds bad, but they're just creeping the news out and making it all about subprime.
[01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:09.731]  You look at actual banks, and I did try to count this up this weekend, because I kept saying $250 billion, $450 billion, $500 billion.
[01:43:09.751 --> 01:43:10.611]  It now looks to be over $700 billion.
[01:43:16.218 --> 01:43:18.479]  Injected by foreign banks and U.S.
[01:43:18.539 --> 01:43:20.740]  banks and central banks and treasuries.
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:36.086]  700 billion dollars that has been injected the last three months, and now they're talking about a new 200 billion, 100 to 200 billion dollar bank super fund to continue to just control the slide.
[01:43:36.146 --> 01:43:39.267]  All it's doing is controlling it.
[01:43:41.268 --> 01:43:44.669]  Meanwhile, the public, unless they dig, only gets news stories like these.
[01:43:46.281 --> 01:43:51.146]  Subprime losses may reach 400 billion, analysts say.
[01:43:51.806 --> 01:43:53.067]  Bloomberg today.
[01:43:53.608 --> 01:44:04.478]  Losses from the falling value of subprime mortgage assets may reach 300 billion to 400 billion worldwide, Deutsche Bank AG analysts said.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.724]  Wall Street's largest bank and brokers will be forced to write down as much as $130 billion.
[01:44:12.691 --> 01:44:20.138]  Because of the slump in subprime-related debt, according to a report today by Mike Mayo, a New York-based analyst.
[01:44:20.178 --> 01:44:24.782]  The rest of the losses will come from smaller banks and investors in mortgage-related securities.
[01:44:24.962 --> 01:44:27.824]  That's you, losing money, who are invested in those.
[01:44:28.605 --> 01:44:38.674]  Citigroup, Inc., because they're not going to bail you out, the small banks, the small brokerages, the small companies, for the last three months when they're not buying the mortgages you sold, that they certified and said were kosher.
[01:44:39.756 --> 01:44:48.150]  Or the securities that are in those hedge funds and in those mutual funds that were heavily invested in these debts.
[01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:51.390]  In the mortgages and other little goodies.
[01:44:51.971 --> 01:45:07.094]  It's not just the subprime, it's the jumbo loans, or the second largest sector, subsector, really suffering as people that were given loans from $550,000 to a million dollars for nicer homes, or in some areas that's a rat shack in San Francisco or New York.
[01:45:07.915 --> 01:45:13.756]  And even people that have money were able to get the loans, but some of those loans haven't been sold.
[01:45:15.012 --> 01:45:20.560]  You sold it to the broker, the broker bought it and then meant to go bundle it and sell it and hasn't been able to do it.
[01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:24.505]  Your local title company, your local bank, this is serious.
[01:45:26.428 --> 01:45:30.053]  And again, this is all being precipitated by design to cause this consolidation.
[01:45:31.278 --> 01:45:37.500]  Citigroup Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co., and Morgan Stanley led more than $40 billion of write-downs of assets as record U.S.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:40.801]  foreclosures plundered asset prices.
[01:45:41.221 --> 01:45:44.362]  About $1.2 trillion of the $10 trillion of outstanding U.S.
[01:45:44.402 --> 01:45:46.402]  home loans are considered to be subprime.
[01:45:46.462 --> 01:45:47.362]  Mayo's shedding a note.
[01:45:47.622 --> 01:45:53.164]  Now remember, only $10 trillion outstanding, but there is over.
[01:45:55.485 --> 01:46:03.173]  400 trillion, this is admitted, some say it's even higher and leveraged out to infinity, 400 plus trillion in derivatives.
[01:46:04.794 --> 01:46:09.579]  And that's paper sold on paper, sold on paper, and all those different classes of derivatives.
[01:46:10.460 --> 01:46:15.866]  And so they're talking about 10 trillion here causing this.
[01:46:17.481 --> 01:46:27.625]  When in reality, they're having losses across the board in other sectors that dwarf what they claim started all this in the subprime, which in the end is all going to be blamed for.
[01:46:28.005 --> 01:46:33.867]  As we told you a year ago, two years ago, five years ago, ten years ago, I've studied other crashes in Asia, in Europe, and in the U.S.
[01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:36.388]  in the past, they always blame it on some little subsector.
[01:46:37.368 --> 01:46:43.050]  Now, what happens is people have spent all the equity they got on first and second mortgages.
[01:46:43.968 --> 01:46:46.390]  Now they can't pay their credit card bills.
[01:46:46.410 --> 01:46:53.314]  The average American individual has $35,000 now in credit card bills.
[01:46:54.255 --> 01:46:55.576]  Now they can't pay that.
[01:46:55.936 --> 01:46:59.278]  What happens as the trillions of dollars, just in the U.S.
[01:46:59.338 --> 01:47:03.461]  alone, in credit card, a large portion of it, doesn't get paid?
[01:47:04.382 --> 01:47:08.745]  What happens when that hits in the next five to six months?
[01:47:09.631 --> 01:47:10.711]  It's already hitting now.
[01:47:11.111 --> 01:47:13.072]  What happens is that starts to unravel.
[01:47:13.092 --> 01:47:15.132]  Are you starting to get the picture?
[01:47:15.152 --> 01:47:21.333]  And there's sector, after sector, after sector, after sector, after sector!
[01:47:23.074 --> 01:47:23.894]  Trying to make my point here.
[01:47:24.654 --> 01:47:25.894]  Hundreds of different sectors.
[01:47:27.855 --> 01:47:29.075]  Why did the globalists do this?
[01:47:29.155 --> 01:47:34.356]  Imagine it as a tsunami of cash, a tsunami of credit, a tsunami
[01:47:35.621 --> 01:47:39.243]  Issue that allows them to get everybody in debt and the big banks at the same time.
[01:47:39.263 --> 01:47:40.784]  We're buying water districts.
[01:47:41.425 --> 01:47:45.167]  We're buying control of assets in school districts.
[01:47:45.247 --> 01:47:46.568]  Buying control of cities.
[01:47:47.149 --> 01:47:49.470]  Buying control of corporations.
[01:47:49.550 --> 01:47:59.957]  Buying control greedily and speculation of any startup company in IT or nanotech or bioengineering or medical or military or prison or security.
[01:48:00.317 --> 01:48:01.738]  You could ever imagine.
[01:48:01.818 --> 01:48:03.099]  See sector after sector.
[01:48:03.875 --> 01:48:12.557]  Buying them up greedily because there was so much capital that the big central banks used that as a weapon to buy up even larger chunks of what they didn't control.
[01:48:13.198 --> 01:48:18.039]  Now to the point where they own or have leveraged about 80% of the global assets.
[01:48:19.959 --> 01:48:24.821]  Of the 20% in the Western world that are left, the middle class owning, that's still a lot of wealth.
[01:48:25.501 --> 01:48:29.982]  They're now horning in and they've got most of those people who even think they're in a good position leveraged.
[01:48:31.826 --> 01:48:51.191]  To the point now where they're going to be bankrupt a lot of them, then that will accelerate the loss of confidence, the economy will crater, and then the majority of the 20% assets that are left on the table can be scooped up like at the end of a 10-hour poker game.
[01:48:51.891 --> 01:49:01.293]  The pot has gotten quite large in the enemy's hands, there's a few little piles of chips left in a few hands, and they're horning in like this game of Risk to win the day and get those as well.
[01:49:05.478 --> 01:49:09.359]  That's the bottom line that we face right now with the economy.
[01:49:12.019 --> 01:49:18.661]  That's why they put a police state in preemptively before they engineered all of this.
[01:49:21.081 --> 01:49:24.162]  And so the question is, how deep will this go?
[01:49:25.823 --> 01:49:27.843]  How bad will it get?
[01:49:29.204 --> 01:49:34.165]  And how does the setup for the attack on Iran tie into all of this?
[01:49:34.766 --> 01:49:43.148]  How does all the talk of the domestic police state and the apparatus being constructed and oiled and maintained and expanded tie into all of this?
[01:49:43.788 --> 01:49:45.028]  We'll tell you when we get back.
[01:49:45.409 --> 01:49:46.809]  Then we'll take calls quickly.
[01:49:46.829 --> 01:49:50.030]  Then I'm gonna get into frequency pollution.
[01:49:50.610 --> 01:49:53.211]  The poisoning, the radiation poisoning of America.
[01:49:54.331 --> 01:49:55.751]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:56.812 --> 01:49:57.812]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.564 --> 01:50:02.745]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:03.465 --> 01:50:05.205]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:50:06.286 --> 01:50:08.526]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:09.086 --> 01:50:11.527]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.267 --> 01:50:19.568]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.603 --> 01:50:27.606]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.067 --> 01:50:31.569]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.589 --> 01:50:34.451]  Bill Verdi is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:34.491 --> 01:50:35.452]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.472 --> 01:50:36.372]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.392 --> 01:50:37.513]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.693 --> 01:50:38.494]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.694 --> 01:50:39.714]  That's what they're after.

[01:50:48.180 --> 01:50:51.342]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.382 --> 01:50:52.403]  You have been warned.
[01:50:54.325 --> 01:51:03.412]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.652 --> 01:51:14.882]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.222 --> 01:51:20.927]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:21.247 --> 01:51:21.647]  I think?
[01:51:39.352 --> 01:51:41.233]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[01:51:41.253 --> 01:51:41.513]  Look!
[01:51:41.693 --> 01:51:42.833]  Up there in the sky!
[01:51:42.913 --> 01:51:43.533]  It's Non-X-Man!
[01:51:43.573 --> 01:51:44.313]  He's in a dive!
[01:51:44.333 --> 01:51:46.754]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[01:51:46.774 --> 01:51:47.374]  Let's go look!
[01:52:06.787 --> 01:52:09.968]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[01:52:10.388 --> 01:52:11.728]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:52:11.948 --> 01:52:12.408]  Take them out.
[01:52:12.988 --> 01:52:13.709]  Let's see.
[01:52:13.729 --> 01:52:18.290]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:52:18.630 --> 01:52:19.130]  Don't worry.
[01:52:19.570 --> 01:52:21.070]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:26.111]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:52:26.631 --> 01:52:28.712]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[01:52:28.832 --> 01:52:31.533]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:52:33.673 --> 01:52:36.316]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:52:36.796 --> 01:52:40.279]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[01:52:40.780 --> 01:52:51.930]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[01:53:08.342 --> 01:53:09.203]  Yeah!
[01:53:09.384 --> 01:53:12.449]  Endgame is out at the Sunless Blues game's final cut.
[01:53:12.509 --> 01:53:15.353]  Infowars.com is the attack point.
[01:53:16.555 --> 01:53:16.816]  Yeah!
[01:53:19.336 --> 01:53:21.117]  All right!
[01:53:51.594 --> 01:53:53.135]  Number one, baby!
[01:53:53.175 --> 01:53:54.036]  Welcome back.
[01:53:54.076 --> 01:53:58.578]  We are on the edge of major changes, as you know.
[01:54:18.326 --> 01:54:21.087]  And why do they want to have this Iran war set up?
[01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:31.969]  It is set up for a unifying effect so that we can have a war right when the bankers implode our economy and then psychologically blame it somehow on the Iranians and the war.
[01:54:31.989 --> 01:54:33.489]  They're already putting out the talking points.
[01:54:33.509 --> 01:54:42.831]  I knew that would be a key point when I heard them suddenly on the neocon radio start saying, oh, all this is happening because of the Iranians.
[01:54:42.891 --> 01:54:45.252]  They dumped the dollar and they started the war and
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.182]  They're going to make our economy plunge.
[01:54:49.543 --> 01:54:51.324]  Doesn't matter if it doesn't make sense.
[01:54:52.605 --> 01:55:03.013]  As long as there's a war, even if we go into a depression, the people won't riot too much because, after all, Homeland Security is just keeping them safe from the evil, wicked Al-Qaeda that comes from Iran.
[01:55:03.033 --> 01:55:04.675]  Doesn't matter if they actually fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:55:05.916 --> 01:55:09.779]  And so that's what we're facing on that front right now.
[01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:13.662]  Now, getting into some of the other
[01:55:14.702 --> 01:55:15.362]  Financial news.
[01:55:15.442 --> 01:55:16.183]  I mentioned this.
[01:55:16.223 --> 01:55:18.404]  Here it is from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:55:20.244 --> 01:55:20.504]  U.S.
[01:55:20.544 --> 01:55:22.905]  banks agree on super fund structure.
[01:55:25.026 --> 01:55:26.047]  The three largest U.S.
[01:55:26.087 --> 01:55:33.310]  banks have agreed on a structure of a $100 billion super fund designed to help unblock the credit market.
[01:55:33.370 --> 01:55:34.050]  See, unblocked.
[01:55:34.130 --> 01:55:34.730]  Still blocked.
[01:55:35.551 --> 01:55:38.572]  The Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.
[01:55:39.102 --> 01:55:42.743]  Then you go on to read in another article out of CNBC, they're talking about $200 billion.
[01:55:43.023 --> 01:55:44.944]  See, it starts with $100 billion, a day later it's $200 billion.
[01:55:45.384 --> 01:55:57.627]  But the fund still has to obtain the blessing of the bank's corporate managers, legal departments, tax experts, and credit rating providers that will assure the debt associated with it before it becomes operational, the paper said.
[01:55:58.248 --> 01:56:04.089]  The Superfund plan was initiated by Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Bank of America with the backing of the U.S.
[01:56:04.109 --> 01:56:06.470]  Treasury Department in the wake of the credit squeeze in September.
[01:56:07.663 --> 01:56:16.167]  Since the three banks have tried to put together the details of the plan and to attract other financial institutions to take part, but so far there have remained sidelined.
[01:56:16.647 --> 01:56:17.127]  Yeah, right.
[01:56:17.687 --> 01:56:34.655]  You've got almost $700 billion injected by central banks into the markets and into these funds and to cover these debts and people that are refusing and people that are going into default.
[01:56:36.275 --> 01:56:48.262]  And so basically, there's just hundreds of billions of dollars every month flying around into the big banks' hands to do whatever they want, while they block buying all the corporate debt they encourage from the lower-level banks that did the deals.
[01:56:49.823 --> 01:56:51.323]  As the Financial Times reported.
[01:56:51.363 --> 01:56:54.025]  Remember, the Financial Times of London already reported this two months ago.
[01:56:54.085 --> 01:56:54.945]  They are doing this.
[01:56:55.366 --> 01:56:59.828]  But by the time you read it in CNBC or the Wall Street Journal, that is not happening.
[01:57:00.388 --> 01:57:02.950]  And I said I'd go to the market, then I backed out of it.
[01:57:03.669 --> 01:57:04.849]  I'll give you the market numbers.
[01:57:06.070 --> 01:57:14.952]  When we come back, I'll give you all the market numbers as we get one hour away from the close of Wall Street.
[01:57:16.972 --> 01:57:22.073]  The market right now is at 13,074.53.
[01:57:22.113 --> 01:57:27.115]  So it basically has stayed where it was as of now last Friday, down almost 700 points.
[01:57:34.102 --> 01:57:35.543]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:57:50.111 --> 01:57:54.294]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.935 --> 01:57:55.755]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.516 --> 01:57:58.037]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.077 --> 01:58:01.900]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.260 --> 01:58:06.383]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.045 --> 01:58:18.272]  As world financial crises deepens, banks, institutions, and private individuals, as well as commodity firms,
[01:58:19.517 --> 01:58:25.719]  Have been dumping oil stocks, selling oil reserves, dumping gold reserves.
[01:58:26.339 --> 01:58:30.220]  And if you watch the gold chart and the other metals charts, this is what they do.
[01:58:30.701 --> 01:58:33.221]  You watch the graph in the last seven years, it only goes up.
[01:58:33.922 --> 01:58:42.704]  But every few months, after it hits a new high, it then goes back down a few percentage points before driving again up towards a new high.
[01:58:42.724 --> 01:58:44.345]  So this is a buying opportunity.
[01:58:45.629 --> 01:58:51.191]  Gold has dropped from a high of $8.37 right now to $8.07.
[01:58:55.092 --> 01:58:59.534]  That's ComEx Gold, ComEx Silver.
[01:59:00.514 --> 01:59:06.296]  Silver has dropped $0.70 something cents.
[01:59:07.356 --> 01:59:09.217]  Gold has dropped $0.2740 from its previous high.
[01:59:16.238 --> 01:59:33.867]  Gold fell more than 3.5% to a one-week low today as sliding oil prices, and they call it sliding, it goes up to $100 and it goes down a few dollars, they call it sliding, as sliding oil prices and a rising dollar prompted investors to cash in on Bullion's recent lightning rally to 28-year highs.
[01:59:34.407 --> 01:59:37.649]  See, because people bought in high, now they're dumping.
[01:59:37.849 --> 01:59:38.370]  They're hedging.
[01:59:38.390 --> 01:59:40.311]  Most of them aren't dumping all of it, they're dumping some.
[01:59:40.351 --> 01:59:41.051]  I'm not dumping any.
[01:59:41.591 --> 01:59:49.374]  Dealers also pointed to some influence from a ripple of risk aversion that ran through equity and foreign exchange markers with a knock-on effect of gold prices.
[01:59:50.715 --> 01:59:56.217]  Sarkozy, of course, last Thursday spoke to the House and said, please buoy your dollar.
[01:59:57.117 --> 01:59:59.158]  Big banks came in and bought dollars.
[01:59:59.198 --> 02:00:00.698]  Big institutions bought dollars.
[02:00:00.738 --> 02:00:01.999]  The Japanese bought dollars.
[02:00:02.419 --> 02:00:04.039]  The Chinese dropped dollars because it dropped 67%.
[02:00:06.627 --> 02:00:13.171]  From its high in 2000, 67% drop in the dollar against the euro, even more to the British for a pound sterling.
[02:00:14.852 --> 02:00:23.598]  And so, again, that's only a short-term fix, because gold is still undervalued.
[02:00:23.658 --> 02:00:30.803]  It should be over $2,200 an ounce for its high with the purchasing power it had in 1980, and that's mainline analysis.
[02:00:31.883 --> 02:00:35.586]  So, again, gold is still half devalued from what it should be.
[02:00:36.471 --> 02:00:36.651]  Yes!
[02:00:54.369 --> 02:00:54.989]  We're good to go.
[02:01:20.376 --> 02:01:21.757]  I could have gotten more than that for it.
[02:01:21.777 --> 02:01:22.697]  That's just spot gold.
[02:01:22.757 --> 02:01:23.678]  It sells for more than that.
[02:01:24.258 --> 02:01:26.879]  It's the markup of the transfers and shipping and all the rest of it.
[02:01:27.859 --> 02:01:36.563]  But gold fell more than 3.5% on a weak low on Monday as sliding oil prices and a rising dollar prompted investors to cash in on bullion's recent lightning rally to 28-year highs.
[02:01:36.863 --> 02:01:43.766]  Dealers also pointed to some influence from the ripple of risk aversion that ran through equity and foreign exchange markets with a knock-on effect of gold prices.
[02:01:44.327 --> 02:01:45.067]  Spot gold
[02:01:45.919 --> 02:01:46.219]  That's right.
[02:01:46.279 --> 02:01:47.440]  I did win higher than that last week.
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:47.920]  Oh, how cheap!
[02:01:47.980 --> 02:01:49.381]  We're getting a great deal.
[02:02:07.501 --> 02:02:17.810]  Per Barrel, after Saudi Arabia and OPEC were discussed boosting oil output in an upcoming meeting to cool surging oil prices, taking some shine off gold's role as an edge against oil-led inflation.
[02:02:18.251 --> 02:02:21.574]  I think that the way we saw today is some long liquidation.
[02:02:21.874 --> 02:02:26.378]  After the most recent rally, this came across the whole complex, including oil and base metals.
[02:02:26.418 --> 02:02:32.684]  Additional pressure came from the weakening euro, said Alexander Zempel, metals trader
[02:02:33.678 --> 02:02:34.238]  It goes on.
[02:02:34.639 --> 02:02:39.142]  Okay, we'll come back, get into some other news, take a few calls, and get into frequency pollution.
[02:02:39.582 --> 02:02:41.223]  Very important information coming up.
[02:02:41.303 --> 02:02:41.803]  Stand by.
[02:02:46.527 --> 02:02:47.927]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:49.008 --> 02:02:50.049]  A new world order.
[02:02:50.769 --> 02:02:55.012]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power called the Builder Bird.
[02:02:55.072 --> 02:02:57.394]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:02:58.574 --> 02:03:00.656]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:03:01.249 --> 02:03:03.772]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.433 --> 02:03:11.762]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.787 --> 02:03:20.229]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.249 --> 02:03:23.731]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:24.111 --> 02:03:26.632]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:26.672 --> 02:03:27.813]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.833 --> 02:03:28.593]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.613 --> 02:03:29.673]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.893 --> 02:03:30.634]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.874 --> 02:03:31.714]  That's what they're after.

[02:05:45.322 --> 02:05:50.365]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.725 --> 02:05:53.007]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.858 --> 02:06:11.704]  Alright, let's blast through some of your phone calls and I'm going to get into the radiation poisoning of America.
[02:06:11.724 --> 02:06:15.926]  Let's talk to Denise in Minnesota.
[02:06:15.946 --> 02:06:17.106]  Denise, thank you for holding.
[02:06:17.546 --> 02:06:18.307]  Hey, you're welcome.
[02:06:18.327 --> 02:06:18.847]  Hi Alex.
[02:06:19.167 --> 02:06:19.407]  Hi.
[02:06:20.468 --> 02:06:23.709]  I just wanted to let you know that my son and I attended
[02:06:24.793 --> 02:06:31.697]  The premiere of Final Cut in Minneapolis last night, it was absolutely fantastic.
[02:06:32.918 --> 02:06:38.482]  Ended up we were just praying and hoping there'd be a good crowd and as it turns out it was standing room only.
[02:06:38.502 --> 02:06:39.682]  500 I'm told.
[02:06:40.043 --> 02:06:44.786]  Oh yeah, I mean the theater was packed and they were standing along the side so it was just wonderful.
[02:06:44.846 --> 02:06:46.727]  I got to meet Jason, that was great.
[02:06:47.547 --> 02:06:51.330]  After they premiered the movie then he took some
[02:06:51.906 --> 02:07:02.219]  There was a question and answer session, which was great, but I just want everybody to know that this movie is so totally different than Lose Change 2.
[02:07:03.601 --> 02:07:08.708]  It was fantastically done, brilliant, in that
[02:07:09.210 --> 02:07:12.813]  It really is a true, true documentary.
[02:07:12.853 --> 02:07:14.014]  Oh, it's actually balanced.
[02:07:14.114 --> 02:07:24.741]  I mean, you know, my films say, here's the facts, here's the evidence, here's what's going on, and I'm starting to bring a little bit of people quote disagreeing in, but this just says, hey, look at this evidence, look at that, what do you think of this?
[02:07:25.002 --> 02:07:25.402]  Exactly.
[02:07:25.442 --> 02:07:27.944]  And it's all really in the New World Order's own words.
[02:07:28.004 --> 02:07:29.105]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:07:29.545 --> 02:07:34.729]  It was incredible, and the response in the crowd, I mean, there was laughter at times,
[02:07:35.592 --> 02:07:37.233]  There were people crying at times.
[02:07:37.413 --> 02:07:40.155]  There were people cheering at times.
[02:07:40.175 --> 02:07:45.778]  So it's got everything in it that will empower people.
[02:07:46.388 --> 02:07:49.629]  To open their minds and go do their own research.
[02:07:50.129 --> 02:07:52.730]  And that is what I think is great about it.
[02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:54.711]  No, it's an absolutely amazing film.
[02:07:54.751 --> 02:07:58.692]  That's why, I mean, seriously folks, we did this professionally.
[02:07:59.173 --> 02:08:02.134]  It deserves to be seen and it deserves to be supported.
[02:08:02.534 --> 02:08:10.917]  Get the DVD right now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or watch it high quality online.
[02:08:11.537 --> 02:08:15.380]  It was great and what we're doing is we're buying up a lot of them
[02:08:35.125 --> 02:08:42.290]  And instead of sending out cards or buying $5 gifts this year, we're giving out the video.
[02:08:42.410 --> 02:08:44.131]  And we're also doing that with Endgame.
[02:08:44.971 --> 02:08:47.453]  So I would encourage everybody to do that.
[02:08:47.813 --> 02:08:49.174]  Once you've seen it, you'll know why.
[02:08:49.314 --> 02:08:54.997]  And it's important because the information is what's most important to wake people up.
[02:08:55.418 --> 02:08:56.979]  Without it, they won't be woke up.
[02:08:57.559 --> 02:08:58.279]  This wakes them up.
[02:08:58.580 --> 02:09:00.681]  I even heard they had to turn quite a few people away from the theater.
[02:09:01.689 --> 02:09:03.050]  Yeah, I mean it was fantastic.
[02:09:03.110 --> 02:09:03.590]  It was great.
[02:09:04.150 --> 02:09:13.075]  And like I said, the crowd that was there was totally diverse from young to old, which was another great thing.
[02:09:13.095 --> 02:09:15.096]  Black, white, old, young, absolutely.
[02:09:15.236 --> 02:09:15.696]  Everything.
[02:09:15.816 --> 02:09:16.837]  It was everything.
[02:09:17.437 --> 02:09:20.638]  And when somebody asked a question, well what can we do?
[02:09:22.079 --> 02:09:24.440]  Somebody in the audience shouted Ron Paul.
[02:09:25.441 --> 02:09:30.283]  And everybody stood up and said Ron Paul, Ron Paul, Ron Paul.
[02:09:31.818 --> 02:09:34.581]  We have a relief stay titan here.
[02:09:34.721 --> 02:09:35.603]  It is so exciting.
[02:09:35.643 --> 02:09:36.223]  God bless you.
[02:09:36.264 --> 02:09:38.206]  Thanks for the encouraging words, Denise.
[02:09:38.226 --> 02:09:39.167]  That is really exciting.
[02:09:39.648 --> 02:09:48.400]  Absolutely get Loose Change with Endgame together and we discount Endgame when you get it with it right now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com
[02:09:49.128 --> 02:09:49.348]  Thank you.
[02:09:49.368 --> 02:09:49.528]  Hi Dan.
[02:09:49.568 --> 02:09:52.030]  Hello, how's Dan Peters here from Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[02:10:13.277 --> 02:10:16.040]  We ain't afraid of these neocons here in Minnesota.
[02:10:16.060 --> 02:10:17.861]  We ain't afraid of them anywhere on Earth.
[02:10:17.881 --> 02:10:19.223]  I talked to people in Brazil.
[02:10:19.243 --> 02:10:22.246]  I talked to people all over the world and we know what's going on.
[02:10:22.286 --> 02:10:23.387]  We know what they're up to.
[02:10:23.407 --> 02:10:26.089]  I was at Loose Change yesterday.
[02:10:26.109 --> 02:10:27.450]  A diverse crowd.
[02:10:27.511 --> 02:10:29.232]  I was amazed by all the senior citizens there.
[02:10:29.252 --> 02:10:30.473]  They haven't forgot history.
[02:10:30.533 --> 02:10:38.201]  They know about all the history of all the wars and all the profit that these scumbags have been making off of killing people for years.
[02:10:39.978 --> 02:10:40.798]  It's dirty money.
[02:10:40.938 --> 02:10:47.021]  I couldn't imagine having money that came from murdering and cluster bombing and land mining children.
[02:10:47.041 --> 02:10:53.023]  I mean, it's just... But again, the globalists have just given themselves over to evil to where they're totally callous now.
[02:10:53.063 --> 02:10:53.944]  They have black hearts.
[02:10:54.324 --> 02:10:55.844]  People know about Ron Paul.
[02:10:55.864 --> 02:10:57.965]  People are waking up.
[02:10:58.606 --> 02:11:02.487]  I work on a major street here in Minneapolis, right in downtown.
[02:11:02.547 --> 02:11:05.868]  I have huge Ron Paul signs out of my sidewalk and my windows.
[02:11:06.349 --> 02:11:09.390]  People come walking in and just say, thanks for putting the signs up.
[02:11:10.943 --> 02:11:15.104]  I walk up to firemen and talk about Building 7.
[02:11:15.525 --> 02:11:16.425]  They don't know about it.
[02:11:16.485 --> 02:11:17.545]  I tell them to Google it.
[02:11:18.045 --> 02:11:19.786]  I walk up to cops and soldiers.
[02:11:19.846 --> 02:11:22.867]  I tell them that they are expendable slaves for the neocons.
[02:11:23.307 --> 02:11:26.688]  That they need to wake up and understand what the job they're doing.
[02:11:27.829 --> 02:11:30.931]  And how they're being subjected to being killed for pennies.
[02:11:31.091 --> 02:11:34.493]  They're not being paid enough to support the war on drugs.
[02:11:34.513 --> 02:11:39.877]  They're not being paid enough to support this illegal wars in 130 countries where we have bases.
[02:11:41.519 --> 02:11:49.985]  When I debate with people on sites like SodaHead and MySpace, I just tell them, Google any issue.
[02:11:50.425 --> 02:11:55.789]  Look at Fox News and look at an alternative media source such as the Guardian or InfoWars.
[02:11:56.229 --> 02:12:03.314]  You look at a Fox News article, it's one paragraph, it's a bag, it says nothing, and then they just try to insult somebody like you or me?
[02:12:03.354 --> 02:12:05.215]  Yeah, they're trying to dumb the debate down.
[02:12:05.575 --> 02:12:06.296]  Yeah, they do.
[02:12:06.376 --> 02:12:17.043]  And you look at an InfoWars article, or you look at a Guardian article, or any of the number of other alternative media sites out there, they're sourced, they know what they're talking about, they're quoting government officials.
[02:12:17.083 --> 02:12:18.904]  We're not making this stuff up!
[02:12:20.858 --> 02:12:31.268]  I know it's frustrating to know that there are over 200 declassified, admitted documents where the government staged terror attacks to start wars or blame it on people or have police state crackdowns.
[02:12:31.729 --> 02:12:39.456]  There are tens of thousands of declassified examples of the government killing police, troops, citizens with chemical, biological, radiologicals just here in the U.S.
[02:12:39.476 --> 02:12:40.658]  to test these systems.
[02:12:41.298 --> 02:12:49.664]  There are thousands and thousands of examples of all of this stuff going on and we are sick of it and we're not going to play games anymore.
[02:12:49.825 --> 02:12:50.845]  I'm not playing games.
[02:12:50.905 --> 02:12:53.307]  I walk up, you know, I'm from North Minneapolis.
[02:12:53.327 --> 02:12:54.988]  It's a poor part of Minneapolis.
[02:12:56.389 --> 02:13:02.314]  I walk up to, it's predominantly African American, I walk up to African Americans and talk to them all the time.
[02:13:03.214 --> 02:13:09.596]  When I get racist comments thrown at me, when I'm riding my bicycle through a park, I ask these kids if they need a hug.
[02:13:10.036 --> 02:13:19.320]  I walk up to policemen and I talk to them about the war on drugs, and every one of them I've talked to shake their head, look down at the ground, and just say, I know, I know.
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:29.023]  With sadness in their eyes, they know that their job is subject to holding up completely ridiculous laws, and they know it.
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:32.601]  A lot of them do know it now.
[02:13:32.621 --> 02:13:44.867]  I mean, how many mainstream articles have there been where the government's caught shipping narcotics in, and then meanwhile, you look at the molecules of Ritalin, or the molecules of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and they are worse than heroin and cocaine.
[02:13:44.887 --> 02:13:54.592]  They hit the same receptors, so the schools are trying to make kids take these, and we have the documents on that, where they want to make half of them take it now, and then they've got to raid somebody's house.
[02:13:54.632 --> 02:13:55.673]  I mean, drugs are bad.
[02:13:55.713 --> 02:13:56.413]  I'm not for them.
[02:13:57.125 --> 02:14:02.986]  The people need to be grabbed and taken to treatment centers, but they don't need to be locked up for 50 years.
[02:14:03.686 --> 02:14:04.547]  No, we need love.
[02:14:04.607 --> 02:14:06.367]  I mean, different strokes for different folks.
[02:14:06.447 --> 02:14:10.948]  I'm not a Christian, but I respect you and other people that are Christian or Muslim or whatever.
[02:14:11.228 --> 02:14:12.288]  It's all about love.
[02:14:12.628 --> 02:14:16.369]  We shouldn't be locking people up in prison for drugs.
[02:14:16.389 --> 02:14:19.310]  We should be taking care of these people that have addictive problems.
[02:14:20.547 --> 02:14:22.247]  Absolutely, I appreciate your call.
[02:14:22.827 --> 02:14:25.588]  It's just so sick what they do with the war on drugs.
[02:14:26.128 --> 02:14:27.808]  And then how many cops have been killed?
[02:14:27.868 --> 02:14:40.691]  Because criminals are involved with drugs, because you've made it criminal, it energizes them, it gives the criminals a profit vat, a huge profit source.
[02:14:41.691 --> 02:14:44.332]  I mean, prohibition in nine years in the U.S.
[02:14:44.412 --> 02:14:46.632]  tripled the size of the Mafia, Fed Zone numbers.
[02:14:48.562 --> 02:14:56.527]  Massively energized criminal gangs got hundreds of cops killed, corrupted the police, tripled alcoholism in this country.
[02:14:56.567 --> 02:14:57.327]  Those are the numbers.
[02:14:58.948 --> 02:15:00.989]  Tripled alcoholism made it cool.
[02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:08.674]  In Europe where they decriminalize drugs in a bunch of countries, drug use goes down in some cases by two-thirds, but always by at least half.
[02:15:09.853 --> 02:15:12.154]  Look, I didn't need somebody to tell me drugs weren't cool when I was 15.
[02:15:12.294 --> 02:15:13.595]  I knew it was stupid.
[02:15:14.015 --> 02:15:17.236]  I knew it made you scrawny and weak and unhealthy and was filled with poisons.
[02:15:17.617 --> 02:15:24.700]  My dad was a medical person, a doctor, and he could explain to me that in the manufacture of it, all the poisons.
[02:15:25.826 --> 02:15:29.309]  My dad just said, look, they'll tell you it's cool, people think it's cool, it's rat poison.
[02:15:30.410 --> 02:15:32.351]  He'd give me articles and explain it, and then I knew.
[02:15:33.352 --> 02:15:35.414]  He'd say, see that kid with all those zits on his face?
[02:15:35.434 --> 02:15:41.218]  That guy's probably 20, looks like he's 11, that's because he started taking drugs when he was young, and it's fried his, you know.
[02:15:41.478 --> 02:15:47.323]  I mean, you know, that's how he tells me not to take drugs, not like, oh, that's too cool, or Hollywood always showing it as cool, you know.
[02:15:47.603 --> 02:15:49.225]  Pulp Fiction, the heroin is cool.
[02:15:49.705 --> 02:15:51.146]  There's nothing cool about it.
[02:15:51.807 --> 02:15:54.709]  Or, you know, Calvin Klein and Heroin Chic and all that trash.
[02:15:56.184 --> 02:15:58.344]  Stop using the drugs!
[02:15:59.225 --> 02:16:01.185]  Now, let's get honest.
[02:16:01.505 --> 02:16:05.006]  When I say drugs, I don't like the illegal stuff.
[02:16:05.326 --> 02:16:06.826]  A few things I try to absolutely hate it.
[02:16:07.346 --> 02:16:08.406]  I do like alcohol.
[02:16:08.446 --> 02:16:09.306]  I do like caffeine.
[02:16:09.326 --> 02:16:10.167]  I do like nicotine.
[02:16:10.207 --> 02:16:10.927]  Those three things.
[02:16:11.307 --> 02:16:12.367]  Everything else I hate.
[02:16:13.067 --> 02:16:14.907]  Maybe that's why I was so addicted a long time ago.
[02:16:15.068 --> 02:16:19.528]  People can go into an apothecary on every street corner and buy heroin, cocaine, whatever they want of it.
[02:16:19.568 --> 02:16:20.369]  Very few used it.
[02:16:21.349 --> 02:16:22.609]  But let me tell you, they sure like
[02:16:23.443 --> 02:16:26.545]  Alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine, baby.
[02:16:28.366 --> 02:16:29.907]  And I'm constantly having battles with it.
[02:16:30.847 --> 02:16:34.970]  By battles, I mean, I'm not like some huge drunkard, but I'll quit drinking for a year and start back for a month.
[02:16:34.990 --> 02:16:38.172]  I mean, all I gotta do is drink it one time and, man, I'm back on it.
[02:16:38.332 --> 02:16:42.574]  And, um, makes you fat, makes you unhealthy.
[02:16:43.975 --> 02:16:49.338]  Cigarettes, I, uh, I'm back on those things again.
[02:16:49.498 --> 02:16:50.679]  I just am a complete idiot.
[02:16:52.682 --> 02:16:56.325]  They are so addictive, especially when you're working 16 hours a day like I am again.
[02:16:57.005 --> 02:16:58.627]  There's all these smokers around my office.
[02:16:58.647 --> 02:16:59.788]  I ought to just ban smoking.
[02:16:59.808 --> 02:17:00.388]  That's a problem.
[02:17:01.028 --> 02:17:02.149]  I'll be up here late one night.
[02:17:02.189 --> 02:17:03.811]  People are out some front smoking cigarettes.
[02:17:04.511 --> 02:17:05.792]  And I'll just go, give me a cigarette.
[02:17:05.812 --> 02:17:07.113]  And the next I'll go, you know what?
[02:17:07.834 --> 02:17:11.737]  I kind of got in the habit of using beer as a stimulant.
[02:17:11.797 --> 02:17:15.460]  And it actually is a depressant, but in small quantities, it's a stimulant.
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:16.300]  It's like midnight.
[02:17:16.801 --> 02:17:17.721]  I'm totally exhausted.
[02:17:17.761 --> 02:17:18.922]  I've been up since 6 a.m.
[02:17:19.343 --> 02:17:22.385]  I've got to do an hour more worth of work to do some deadline.
[02:17:24.128 --> 02:17:26.812]  And I'll just get a six pack and drink two beers.
[02:17:26.852 --> 02:17:29.395]  Not like it's heavy drinking, but it, it wakes me up.
[02:17:30.316 --> 02:17:35.483]  And, uh, so I've, uh, we all need to stop all this stuff.
[02:17:36.003 --> 02:17:40.429]  We need to stop because the New World Order taxes us and controls us through all this stuff.
[02:17:40.829 --> 02:17:42.692]  It's time to get off the drugs.
[02:17:46.983 --> 02:17:50.827]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us up to gold standard, the U.S.
[02:17:50.867 --> 02:17:52.129]  dollar has been devaluating.
[02:17:52.269 --> 02:17:55.852]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[02:17:56.153 --> 02:17:58.675]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[02:17:59.076 --> 02:18:00.817]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[02:18:01.138 --> 02:18:03.460]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[02:18:04.501 --> 02:18:14.950]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[02:18:14.990 --> 02:18:18.913]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[02:18:18.993 --> 02:18:22.075]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[02:18:22.276 --> 02:18:24.738]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[02:18:24.818 --> 02:18:27.800]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:27.980]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:33.865 --> 02:18:36.387]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[02:18:45.962 --> 02:18:48.363]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:48.923 --> 02:18:58.586]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[02:18:58.606 --> 02:19:03.268]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[02:19:03.288 --> 02:19:08.670]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[02:19:09.483 --> 02:19:19.730]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.
[02:19:20.711 --> 02:19:28.437]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:29.097 --> 02:19:30.538]  Just call our toll free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:30.558 --> 02:19:30.938]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:30.958 --> 02:19:31.378]  Call now.
[02:19:31.398 --> 02:19:34.059]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:19:45.823 --> 02:19:50.768]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:19:51.089 --> 02:19:52.971]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[02:19:53.171 --> 02:19:56.214]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:19:56.394 --> 02:19:59.538]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:19:59.838 --> 02:20:01.680]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:20:01.940 --> 02:20:05.641]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:20:05.922 --> 02:20:08.582]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:20:09.203 --> 02:20:13.504]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:20:13.704 --> 02:20:17.946]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:20:18.386 --> 02:20:22.729]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:20:23.029 --> 02:20:27.292]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:20:27.632 --> 02:20:33.496]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:20:33.796 --> 02:20:36.237]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:20:36.438 --> 02:20:36.958]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:20:36.978 --> 02:20:38.059]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:20:45.928 --> 02:20:48.471]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[02:20:48.872 --> 02:20:52.155]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[02:20:52.616 --> 02:20:56.060]  Hemp, used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[02:20:56.400 --> 02:21:03.489]  Hemp, this God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[02:21:03.849 --> 02:21:07.091]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[02:21:07.371 --> 02:21:11.233]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[02:21:11.553 --> 02:21:15.895]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[02:21:16.256 --> 02:21:22.639]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[02:21:22.959 --> 02:21:27.281]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[02:21:27.481 --> 02:21:29.362]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?
[02:21:29.602 --> 02:21:35.845]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.
[02:21:36.205 --> 02:21:39.507]  Learn, help, shop at hempusa.org.
[02:21:39.687 --> 02:21:40.767]  We do not charge for shipping.
[02:21:40.827 --> 02:21:41.988]  That's 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org today.
[02:22:04.205 --> 02:22:14.535]  There must be some kind of way out of here Say that joke back to the beat There's too much confusion
[02:22:17.177 --> 02:22:20.978]  Alright, we posted this about a month ago, and I'm going to get it reposted on the main page.
[02:22:21.018 --> 02:22:24.079]  I forgot to call Paul to have him do that.
[02:22:24.099 --> 02:22:30.661]  But just type in the Radiation Poisoning of America, and it's up on Global Research, the Idaho Observer, many other places.
[02:22:30.901 --> 02:22:37.223]  And before I attempt to read all 12 pages of tiny text of this, I don't know how good a job I'll do of that.
[02:22:37.883 --> 02:22:38.863]  I just want to beg you.
[02:22:42.432 --> 02:22:42.872]  I don't know.
[02:23:00.786 --> 02:23:06.029]  If you're going to use them, you've got to always have hands-free, but no, it is radiating your hand.
[02:23:06.049 --> 02:23:18.215]  If you stick it on your belt, it is constantly sending and receiving transmissions and is literally thousands of studies, not hundreds, thousands of major universities, medical institutions.
[02:23:18.375 --> 02:23:23.978]  I see articles out of major newspapers every couple days, sometimes multiple per day.
[02:23:25.171 --> 02:23:27.193]  Where it is guaranteed.
[02:23:27.273 --> 02:23:29.876]  It is microwave radiation.
[02:23:30.276 --> 02:23:35.382]  It goes right into the nuclei of the cells and it bombards them.
[02:23:35.922 --> 02:23:37.724]  It shoots through them.
[02:23:39.546 --> 02:23:42.169]  And it breaks the strands.
[02:23:42.289 --> 02:23:47.394]  And it is the breaking of the strands that then cause the mutation in cell division.
[02:23:48.380 --> 02:23:50.161]  It's guaranteed to cause cataracts.
[02:23:50.181 --> 02:23:55.482]  They've got all these studies that whatever side of the head you tend to hold the phone, that's the side you get the worst cataract.
[02:23:55.542 --> 02:23:56.702]  It's also hitting the other eye.
[02:23:57.343 --> 02:24:00.724]  But it's about a foot around corona of radiation.
[02:24:00.784 --> 02:24:01.864]  It's really strong.
[02:24:03.204 --> 02:24:07.666]  And the eye cells don't replicate like most of the other cells.
[02:24:09.126 --> 02:24:09.426]  Okay?
[02:24:09.486 --> 02:24:10.946]  After you're like five years old, they're done.
[02:24:11.507 --> 02:24:13.447]  And so that's why you really get it bad.
[02:24:13.487 --> 02:24:15.248]  I mean, it's radiating the cells.
[02:24:17.037 --> 02:24:34.903]  There is study after study by major universities and institutions that after 15 minutes on the average cell phone, different ones have different radiation levels, that the brain and blood in a localized area, and it shoots right into the brain, thank goodness the skull does deflect some of it, and actually heats the brain.
[02:24:34.943 --> 02:24:38.065]  I mean it's actually heating your brain.
[02:24:40.285 --> 02:24:44.547]  And I get up here and I read this article and that article, London Guardian, BBC, Associated Press,
[02:24:46.351 --> 02:24:50.475]  And I've actually spent hours and hours every few months when I get upset about this issue.
[02:24:50.495 --> 02:24:52.197]  There's so many we have to keep track of.
[02:24:53.218 --> 02:25:03.609]  But this stuff is proliferating and I should go to the mall every once in a while or I'd walk down the street or I'm driving my car and I see 10-year-olds with cell phones and they go, I'll keep track of my child with this or I send them to school with it.
[02:25:05.350 --> 02:25:08.631]  This isn't like other things where we're not sure it's hurting people.
[02:25:09.132 --> 02:25:10.812]  Grass doesn't grow as well.
[02:25:11.713 --> 02:25:12.833]  Seeds are deformed.
[02:25:13.233 --> 02:25:14.314]  I've got all those studies.
[02:25:14.654 --> 02:25:17.795]  Sometimes it actually dies around the cell phone towers.
[02:25:18.355 --> 02:25:20.636]  It's actually killing plants.
[02:25:21.736 --> 02:25:24.117]  And that's what's really strong is the towers themselves.
[02:25:25.738 --> 02:25:33.141]  Now you can debate all day what, you know, the different types of RF, UHF, VHF, AM, FM, what they do.
[02:25:34.164 --> 02:25:34.444]  I don't
[02:25:58.007 --> 02:25:59.948]  We're going to be doing more articles on this ourselves.
[02:25:59.968 --> 02:26:02.130]  I'm going to be getting a string of guests on on this subject.
[02:26:02.410 --> 02:26:08.874]  We're going to create a big data page with the medical reports and the facts on PrisonPlanet.com because that's what we do.
[02:26:08.934 --> 02:26:15.519]  We try to warn people about vaccines, about other things that are causal effects, that are roots
[02:26:17.577 --> 02:26:18.237]  of what's happening.
[02:26:18.757 --> 02:26:28.060]  I mean, you use a cell phone for 10 years, you more than double your risk of getting a rare brain tumor right on the side of the brain where the cell phone is.
[02:26:30.421 --> 02:26:35.923]  And I've been using cell phones for, heaven help me, 15 years.
[02:26:35.943 --> 02:26:42.505]  I'm not a big talker, so not as much as most people, but it's just, we have to stop.
[02:26:42.545 --> 02:26:43.965]  And I know you habitualize.
[02:26:44.625 --> 02:26:45.286]  It's a habit.
[02:26:45.606 --> 02:26:46.746]  It becomes your little baby.
[02:26:47.583 --> 02:26:48.963]  And you're used to having it in your pocket.
[02:26:48.983 --> 02:26:49.984]  You're used to using it.
[02:26:50.004 --> 02:26:51.284]  I mean, I get so much work done.
[02:26:51.344 --> 02:26:52.624]  I'm working when I'm driving to work.
[02:26:52.964 --> 02:26:55.805]  I'm working when I'm going to do errands at the bank or the grocery store.
[02:26:56.225 --> 02:26:57.726]  Honey, get me a thing of flour.
[02:26:57.746 --> 02:27:05.688]  I mean, I'll have like a list of 10 people to call when I'm going to be in traffic for 30, 40 minutes or when I'm going somewhere far away in the city an hour and a half during rush hour.
[02:27:06.028 --> 02:27:07.668]  And I'll do all my business.
[02:27:07.748 --> 02:27:09.389]  I'm just bam, bam, bam through the calls.
[02:27:10.189 --> 02:27:10.789]  It doesn't matter.
[02:27:11.289 --> 02:27:14.890]  And now you can't pull over and use a phone booth.
[02:27:15.623 --> 02:27:18.264]  Or a payphone, because they've gotten rid of 99% of those.
[02:27:19.705 --> 02:27:20.425]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:27:20.465 --> 02:27:22.906]  We've got to do something about this.
[02:27:22.926 --> 02:27:26.268]  So when we get back, as fast as I can, I'm going to read through this.
[02:27:26.808 --> 02:27:27.748]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:27.768 --> 02:27:28.129]  Stay with me.
[02:27:36.072 --> 02:27:37.012]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.453 --> 02:27:39.073]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.974 --> 02:27:42.715]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.329 --> 02:27:48.169]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:27:48.309 --> 02:27:54.991]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:27:55.271 --> 02:28:03.453]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:28:03.653 --> 02:28:09.434]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:28:09.454 --> 02:28:11.315]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:28:11.395 --> 02:28:13.495]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:28:13.575 --> 02:28:17.940]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:28:18.100 --> 02:28:20.243]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:28:20.343 --> 02:28:28.111]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:28:28.592 --> 02:28:29.072]  We're good to go.
[02:28:46.877 --> 02:28:48.098]  This is Elizabeth Border.

[02:29:00.788 --> 02:29:02.970]  A coming One World Church?
[02:29:03.730 --> 02:29:09.034]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.170]  1-800-300-8069.
[02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:34.031]  Sears, where it begins.
[02:30:34.131 --> 02:30:34.891]  Alright, hold on to your hat.
[02:30:34.911 --> 02:30:35.631]  I should have started earlier.
[02:30:35.711 --> 02:30:36.632]  I'm gonna try to read all this.
[02:30:36.652 --> 02:30:37.712]  If I don't, I'm gonna read it tomorrow.
[02:31:02.144 --> 02:31:09.789]  Now again, much of what I'm going to read here, when it gets to scientific documentation, I have separately seen myself, so I'm confirming this, and I'm letting you know this is well-researched.
[02:31:11.130 --> 02:31:13.852]  By Amy Worthington, the radiation poisoning of America.
[02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:24.839]  Prior to 1996, the wireless age was not coming online fast enough, primarily because communities had the authority to block the setting of cell towers.
[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:28.882]  But the Federal Communications Act of 96 made it nearly impossible
[02:31:29.542 --> 02:31:30.183]  We're good to go.
[02:31:52.248 --> 02:31:57.869]  Short-sighted, we have incorporated into our lives every wireless toy that comes on the market.
[02:31:58.309 --> 02:32:00.730]  We behave as if we are addicted to radiation.
[02:32:01.150 --> 02:32:05.331]  Our addiction to cell phones has led us to harder drugs like wireless internet.
[02:32:05.771 --> 02:32:10.792]  And now we are bathing in the radiation that our wireless enthusiasm has unleashed.
[02:32:12.153 --> 02:32:13.093]  Those who are addicted
[02:32:15.544 --> 02:32:26.819]  Uniformed, corporately biased, and politically influenced may dismiss our scientifically sound concerns about the apocalyptic hazards of wireless radiation, but we must not.
[02:32:28.601 --> 02:32:30.844]  Instead, we must sound the alarm.
[02:32:32.794 --> 02:32:40.379]  Isla Garcia wore jewelry for the first day she went to work as a fire lookout for the state of California in the summer of 2002.
[02:32:40.559 --> 02:32:51.086]  The intense radiation from the dozens of RF microwave antennas surrounding the lookout heated the metals on her body enough to turn her skin and to burn it.
[02:32:51.366 --> 02:32:52.807]  I still have those scars, she says.
[02:32:52.867 --> 02:32:55.589]  I never wore jewelry to work after that.
[02:32:58.650 --> 02:33:00.612]  Likely mountain lookout on the U.S.
[02:33:02.529 --> 02:33:03.029]  We're good to go.
[02:33:22.816 --> 02:33:29.160]  There were also three state communications antennas mounted on the lookout only six feet from where we walked.
[02:33:29.500 --> 02:33:31.181]  We climbed past them every day.
[02:33:31.801 --> 02:33:40.326]  Motorola Company manuals for management of communication sites confirm that high-frequency radiation from these antennas is nasty stuff.
[02:33:40.386 --> 02:33:48.351]  I've had engineers tell me that in the high-powered radiation relay towers, when a bird flies through it, it'll knock them down if they're blurping out their communications.
[02:33:48.891 --> 02:33:49.872]  Safety regulators
[02:33:51.064 --> 02:34:01.826]  Mandate wearing warning signs, EMF awareness training, protective gear, even transmitter deactivation for personnel working close to antennas.
[02:34:01.946 --> 02:34:06.247]  Garcia and co-worker Mary Jasso were never warned about the hazards.
[02:34:06.387 --> 02:34:14.009]  This, they say, demonstrates extreme malfeasance on the part of the agencies and commercial companies responsible for their exposure.
[02:34:15.874 --> 02:34:22.999]  By the end of the fire season, Garcia and Jasso were so ill that they were forced to retire and the lookout was closed to state personnel.
[02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:31.965]  Garcia, 52, is now severely disabled with a fibrobiology, autoimmune, and acute nerve degeneration.
[02:34:32.446 --> 02:34:38.230]  Medical tests confirm broken DNA strands in her blood and abnormal tissue death in her brain.
[02:34:40.425 --> 02:34:53.414]  Dr. Gunnar Hauser, a medical specialist in neurotoxicity, states that Garcia's disorders are a result of chronic electromagnetic field exposure in the microwave range and that she has become totally disabled as a result.
[02:34:53.434 --> 02:35:01.639]  Dr. Hauser wrote, in my experience, patients develop multi-system complaints after EMF exposure just as they do to toxic chemical exposure.
[02:35:02.940 --> 02:35:08.244]  Jasso, who worked at the Lookout for 11 seasons, is also disabled with brain and lung damage.
[02:35:09.713 --> 02:35:13.956]  Partial left side paralysis, muscle tremors, bone pain, and DNA damage.
[02:35:14.396 --> 02:35:20.341]  Jasso discovered that all lookouts who worked Likely Mountain since 89 are disabled.
[02:35:20.681 --> 02:35:26.405]  At only 61 years of age, she has lost much of her memory that she cannot remember back to when her first three children were born.
[02:35:26.705 --> 02:35:32.610]  She fears that communications radiation may be a main factor in the nation's phenomenal epidemics of dementia and autism.
[02:35:33.692 --> 02:35:39.676]  Both women say they have been unjustly denied workers comp and medical benefits and it goes on.
[02:35:39.696 --> 02:35:48.861]  22 other members of Garcia and Jasso's two families received likely mountain radiation exposure all now suffer serious and expensive illnesses including
[02:35:49.261 --> 02:36:07.707]  Tumors, blood abnormalities, stomach problems, lung damage because they become visitor, bone pain, muscle spasm, extreme fatigue, tremors, numbness, impaired motor skills, cataracts, memory loss, spinal degeneration, sleep problems, low immunity to infection, hearing and vision problems, hair loss, and allergies.
[02:36:09.428 --> 02:36:15.650]  And it goes on to talk about her husband who often stayed with her at the lookout, has a rare soft tissue sarcoma known to be radiation related.
[02:36:17.404 --> 02:36:17.685]  I think so.
[02:36:28.121 --> 02:36:29.601]  Nuclear bombs on a pole.
[02:36:29.701 --> 02:36:41.944]  Painful conditions endured by the families of Garcia and Jasso are identical to those suffered by Japanese victims of gamma-wave radiation after nuclear explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
[02:36:42.244 --> 02:36:56.447]  Five decades of studies confirm that non-ionizing communications radiation in RF microwave spectrum has the same, and this is all footnoted by the way, effect on human health as ionizing gamma-wave radiation from atomic reactions.
[02:36:56.887 --> 02:37:10.416]  Leading German radiation expert, Dr. Theo Eckel, an official with the German Medical Association, states that injuries that result from radioactive radiation are identical with the effects of electromagnetic radiation.
[02:37:10.816 --> 02:37:13.818]  The damages are so similar that they are hard to differentiate.
[02:37:13.918 --> 02:37:14.559]  Paul Foote noted.
[02:37:15.319 --> 02:37:24.185]  Understanding what happened to Likely Mountain is critical to understanding the public health threat posed by RF microwave radiation in the United States.
[02:37:25.905 --> 02:37:46.502]  The families of Garcia and Jasso, plus previous lookout workers and multitudes of tourists who visited Likely Mountain on camping and sightseeing, were beamed by the same kinds of high-frequency radiation that blasts from tens of thousands of neighborhood cell towers and rooftop antennas erected across America for wireless communications.
[02:37:46.542 --> 02:37:52.948]  The city of San Francisco, with an area of only seven square miles,
[02:37:55.046 --> 02:37:59.221]  Has over 2,500 licensed cell phone antennas positioned in 530 locations throughout the city.
[02:38:02.623 --> 02:38:07.624]  In practical terms, the city, like thousands of others, is being wave-nuked 24 hours a day.
[02:38:08.004 --> 02:38:20.466]  The identical damage resulting from both radioactive gamma waves and high-frequency microwaves involves a pathological condition in which the nuclei of a radiated human cell splinter into fragments called micronuclei.
[02:38:20.906 --> 02:38:23.927]  Micronuclei are the definitive precursor of cancer.
[02:38:24.347 --> 02:38:30.528]  During the 1986 nuclear reactor disaster in Chernobyl, the ionizing radiation release was equivalent to 400
[02:38:32.250 --> 02:38:37.136]  Atomic bombs with an estimated ultimate human death toll of 10,000 deaths and counting.
[02:38:38.818 --> 02:38:44.024]  Exposed Russians quickly develop blood cell micronuclei leaving them at high risk for cancer.
[02:38:49.153 --> 02:38:50.694]  What they wouldn't tell us.
[02:38:51.034 --> 02:38:57.157]  RF microwaves from cell phones and cell tower transmitters also cause micronuclei damage in blood cells.
[02:38:57.537 --> 02:39:00.679]  This was reported a decade ago by Drs.
[02:39:00.739 --> 02:39:08.663]  Henry Lai and Nadrea Tsai, biomedical researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle.
[02:39:09.063 --> 02:39:11.504]  Dr. Tsai is famous for refining
[02:39:13.849 --> 02:39:16.970]  Essay techniques used in identifying DNA damage.
[02:39:17.470 --> 02:39:32.695]  Lai and Tsai demonstrated in numerous animal studies, there's thousands of these by the way, that mobile phone radiation quickly causes DNA shingle and double strand breaks and leaves at levels well below the current federal safe exposure standards.
[02:39:33.155 --> 02:39:33.515]  Cited.
[02:39:34.375 --> 02:39:39.137]  The telecommunications industry, there's all footnotes in this article, the telecommunications industry knows
[02:39:40.129 --> 02:39:51.157]  This thanks to their own, now listen to this, six-year wireless technology research, I pulled this up last night, WTR study program mandated by Congress and completed in 99.
[02:39:52.858 --> 02:40:02.325]  Gathering a team of over 200 doctors, scientists, and experts in the field, WTR research showed that human blood exposed to cell phone radiation had a 300% increase
[02:40:05.583 --> 02:40:09.706]  Three hundred percent increase in genetic damage in the form of micronuclei.
[02:40:09.947 --> 02:40:10.367]  Footnote.
[02:40:10.887 --> 02:40:22.277]  Dr. George Karlo, a public health expert who coordinated the WTR studies, confirms that exposure to communications radiation from wireless technology is a potentially
[02:40:22.995 --> 02:40:26.418]  The biggest health insult this nation has ever seen.
[02:40:27.139 --> 02:40:34.044]  Dr. Carlo believes, in order to get him on, that RF microwave radiation is a greater threat than cigarette smoking and asbestos.
[02:40:34.545 --> 02:40:45.514]  In 2000, European communications giant T-Mobile commissioned the German Echo Logo Institute to review all available scientific evidence in regard
[02:40:47.065 --> 02:40:49.670]  To the health risk of the wireless telecommunications.
[02:40:49.770 --> 02:40:54.779]  Echo Logo found over 220 peer-reviewed published papers documenting the cancer.
[02:40:57.103 --> 02:40:57.684]  Enticing.
[02:41:00.799 --> 02:41:01.099]  Thank you.
[02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:27.152]  Project confirmed that microwaves from wireless communications devices cause significant single and double DNA breaks in both human and animal cells under laboratory conditions.
[02:41:27.232 --> 02:41:27.792]  All footnoted.
[02:41:28.092 --> 02:41:28.933]  I'm going to stop doing that now.
[02:41:29.193 --> 02:41:37.695]  In 2005, a Chinese medical study confirmed statistically significant DNA damage from pulsed microwaves at cell phones and cell phone levels.
[02:41:38.115 --> 02:41:47.437]  The same year, University of Chicago researchers described how pulsed communications microwaves alter the expression in human cells at non-thermal exposure levels.
[02:41:49.716 --> 02:41:51.699]  That's even when it's not up against your head actually heating.
[02:41:52.860 --> 02:42:01.512]  Because gamma waves from RF microwave radiation are identically carcinogenic and genotoxic to the cellular roots of life, the
[02:42:03.260 --> 02:42:05.382]  Safe dose of either kind of radiation is zero.
[02:42:05.522 --> 02:42:10.206]  No study has proven that any level of exposure from cell-damaging radiation is safe for humans.
[02:42:10.627 --> 02:42:20.496]  Dr. Carlo confirms that cell damage is not dose-dependent because any exposure level, no matter how small, can trigger damage response by cell mechanisms.
[02:42:22.324 --> 02:42:23.044]  It's cumulative.
[02:42:23.364 --> 02:42:24.104]  Officials of the U.S.
[02:42:24.124 --> 02:42:35.207]  Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health closely reviewed the damaging results of the WTR studies commissioned by the federal government, which also revealed microwave damage to the blood-brain barrier.
[02:42:35.227 --> 02:42:41.049]  That's where you end up getting the most common cancers now, is in that membrane area.
[02:42:41.969 --> 02:42:49.851]  But these officials have chosen to downplay, obfuscate, and even deny the irresponsible science of the day.
[02:42:51.368 --> 02:42:52.689]  Irrepressible science of the day.
[02:42:53.189 --> 02:43:14.038]  Ranking in billions from selling spectrum licenses, the Feds have allowed the telecom industry to unleash demonstrably dangerous technology which induces millions of people to become brain-intimate and improperly tested wireless devices, and which saturates the nation with carcinogenic waves
[02:43:14.884 --> 02:43:16.224]  To service those devices.
[02:43:16.284 --> 02:43:21.286]  Dr. Carlos says that even the American Cancer Society is in bed with the communications industry.
[02:43:21.326 --> 02:43:23.707]  Well, they're, you know, of course, they were started by the Rockefellers.
[02:43:24.027 --> 02:43:26.728]  Which infuses the society with substantial contributions.
[02:43:29.069 --> 02:43:30.129]  Two ways to die.
[02:43:30.189 --> 02:43:34.410]  Medical science illustrates that there are two ways to die from radiation poisoning.
[02:43:34.470 --> 02:43:35.711]  Fast burn and slow burn.
[02:43:36.534 --> 02:43:43.206]  Nuclear flash burn, Japanese, had parts of their flesh melt off before they died in agony within hours and days.
[02:43:43.267 --> 02:43:47.514]  People have also died, quickly died, after walking through powerful radiation beams.
[02:43:48.482 --> 02:43:52.065]  Which can microwave cook internal organs within seconds of exposure.
[02:43:52.545 --> 02:43:57.189]  Slow burn radiation mechanisms are cumulative, progressive, ongoing, and congenital.
[02:43:57.249 --> 02:43:59.411]  The perfect population production weapon, I would add.
[02:43:59.872 --> 02:44:04.175]  Thousands of Japanese nuke bomb victims died painfully years after the exposures.
[02:44:04.636 --> 02:44:12.963]  The slow burn process of RF microwave exposure is manifested by cancer clusters commonly found in communities irradiated by cell tower transmitters.
[02:44:13.323 --> 02:44:16.466]  Recent Swedish epidemiological studies confirm that for two
[02:44:17.166 --> 02:44:19.868]  Human DNA hears the energetic cacophony loud and clear.
[02:44:43.041 --> 02:44:50.425]  Reacting like the human ear would to high volume country music, R&B plus rock and roll, screaming through the same speaker.
[02:44:50.525 --> 02:44:56.868]  Radiated cells struggle to protect themselves against the destructive dissidence by hardening their membranes.
[02:44:57.748 --> 02:44:59.769]  This ceases to receive nourishment
[02:45:00.289 --> 02:45:09.555]  So, it's aging your cells, stops releasing toxins, die prematurely, and spill micronuclei fragments into the sort of tumor bank account.
[02:45:09.715 --> 02:45:10.615]  That's footnoted.
[02:45:10.955 --> 02:45:17.019]  This is precisely how microwave radiation prematurely ages living tissues.
[02:45:17.639 --> 02:45:19.220]  Why, the sun does that to your skin.
[02:45:19.240 --> 02:45:22.462]  You need a little bit of it, that's how we're designed, but massive amounts, uh-uh.
[02:45:24.463 --> 02:45:27.585]  By the way, being next to you, an RF burns you, just next to a transmitter.
[02:45:28.533 --> 02:45:29.493]  Duking the crew.
[02:45:29.913 --> 02:45:39.796]  The constant roaming pain is intense for 32-year-old Kenneth Hurtudo of South Carolina, California.
[02:45:40.937 --> 02:45:47.018]  He's been to Hell and back, starting with a 7-year tumor, 7-pound tumor on his kidney.
[02:45:47.359 --> 02:45:48.519]  Diagnosed in 2002.
[02:45:48.579 --> 02:45:49.799]  The cancer spread to his brain.
[02:45:50.139 --> 02:45:52.240]  His first brain tumor was removed.
[02:45:53.277 --> 02:45:56.979]  The second by the Cyberknife.
[02:45:56.999 --> 02:45:58.900]  In 2005, cancer nodes were found in his lungs.
[02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:01.561]  By 2006, the cancer had metastasized to his lungs.
[02:46:02.322 --> 02:46:05.844]  This year, he is battling three excruciating tumors on his spinal cord.
[02:46:06.644 --> 02:46:08.205]  He says he hates his seizures.
[02:46:08.605 --> 02:46:10.386]  The last one came on while he was driving.
[02:46:10.426 --> 02:46:12.707]  It's like the devil taking over your body, he says.
[02:46:13.347 --> 02:46:19.151]  Now unable to work, Pertabo says he was relatively healthy in 98.
[02:46:20.575 --> 02:46:27.363]  When he began a career as an installer for large international corporation manufacturing electronic equipment for wireless providers.
[02:46:27.803 --> 02:46:41.299]  At the base of cell towers there is the equipment hunt where installers assemble the radios, amplifiers, and filters which generate man-made microwave frequencies and route them up the transmitter antennas through huge cables.
[02:46:42.182 --> 02:46:52.874]  Mounted on sector supports, amply named Alpha, Beta, and Gamma, the antennas send and receive these carcinogenic radio waves and their pulse data packets at the speed of light.
[02:46:53.315 --> 02:46:58.441]  Posted on locked fences around the huts are danger warning signs.
[02:46:58.941 --> 02:47:01.624]  He says you look around these sites and you find dead
[02:47:04.275 --> 02:47:06.516]  He doesn't know how much radiation he got on the job.
[02:47:06.576 --> 02:47:10.336]  He says there are at least four connection spots inside the hub where radiation can leak.
[02:47:29.716 --> 02:47:35.581]  He could not avoid the heat when he turned the radios on for testing, and he wonders if his cancer is the result.
[02:47:36.662 --> 02:47:42.607]  When I first got hired, we had safety meetings, but they were pretty much minimize the hazards, he remembers.
[02:47:43.107 --> 02:47:48.972]  He was issued no electromagnetic safety clothing, and it was not until 2002 that he got radiation meter to wear.
[02:47:49.432 --> 02:47:57.499]  The meter is supposed to warn you if they're getting too much radiation, he says, but I put mine on a stick and placed it next to the antennas, and the alarm never went off.
[02:47:58.231 --> 02:48:07.814]  A medical report on the International Journal of Occupational and Health confirms that workers exposed to high levels of RF microwave radiation routinely have astronomical cancer rates.
[02:48:08.854 --> 02:48:17.856]  The report notes that these workers, the latency period between high radiation exposure and illness is short compared to less exposed populations.
[02:48:18.396 --> 02:48:19.757]  We're on page 4, it goes for 12 pages.
[02:48:24.285 --> 02:48:29.867]  I am strongly considering in the next couple years moving out of Austin and going to like Montana or something.
[02:48:31.147 --> 02:48:33.208]  I mean, we just got to get away from it, folks.
[02:48:33.288 --> 02:48:35.709]  And I can't even stop using a cell phone.
[02:48:35.789 --> 02:48:36.989]  I am totally stopping.
[02:48:37.809 --> 02:48:42.591]  And these things are everywhere and we're completely bathed in it and there's no debating it.
[02:48:42.731 --> 02:48:43.391]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.352 --> 02:48:47.753]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.773 --> 02:48:51.514]  A new world order in the near future.
[02:48:52.407 --> 02:48:54.788]  Earth is dominated by a powerful group of gods.
[02:48:55.488 --> 02:48:57.209]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:57.449 --> 02:49:00.550]  Wouldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:03.551]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.291 --> 02:49:11.654]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.617 --> 02:49:19.620]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:23.581]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.942 --> 02:49:26.043]  Build a barrier that makes great progress for the world.
[02:49:26.523 --> 02:49:27.463]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.483 --> 02:49:28.424]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.444 --> 02:49:29.524]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.724 --> 02:49:30.485]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.705 --> 02:49:31.845]  That's what I have to teach you.

[02:49:47.115 --> 02:49:48.176]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:49:48.496 --> 02:49:51.278]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.539 --> 02:49:55.702]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.123 --> 02:49:56.963]  So what do you do?
[02:49:57.264 --> 02:50:01.848]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.328 --> 02:50:04.469]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:50:45.734 --> 02:50:48.355]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:50:48.755 --> 02:50:53.718]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:50:54.098 --> 02:50:55.838]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:50:56.139 --> 02:51:00.941]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:51:01.141 --> 02:51:02.101]  How much do you want?
[02:51:02.321 --> 02:51:03.062]  When do you want it?
[02:51:03.442 --> 02:51:05.042]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:51:05.343 --> 02:51:06.163]  When will you need it?
[02:51:06.403 --> 02:51:08.424]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:51:08.604 --> 02:51:09.685]  Will there be any food?
[02:51:09.925 --> 02:51:11.265]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:51:11.465 --> 02:51:16.528]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:51:16.728 --> 02:51:19.949]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:51:20.309 --> 02:51:23.811]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:51:24.131 --> 02:51:25.111]  How much will you need?
[02:51:25.371 --> 02:51:25.972]  We don't know.
[02:51:26.252 --> 02:51:27.172]  How much do you want?
[02:51:27.372 --> 02:51:28.113]  All you can get.
[02:51:28.293 --> 02:51:29.013]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:29.373 --> 02:51:32.155]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:51:32.436 --> 02:51:32.756]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:51:32.776 --> 02:51:34.617]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:51:34.637 --> 02:51:35.698]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:51:35.758 --> 02:51:36.439]  Well, you were sleeping.
[02:51:36.719 --> 02:51:37.720]  They came and took it all away.
[02:52:04.176 --> 02:52:08.460]  By the way, they knew what radiation, microwave radiation did in the 50s.
[02:52:10.922 --> 02:52:16.847]  And they wouldn't even tell people in the military up on these big lookouts and relay towers to wear protective stuff.
[02:52:16.887 --> 02:52:19.389]  They just, because if they admitted it, then there'd be lawsuits.
[02:52:19.429 --> 02:52:20.690]  They just said, hey, let them die.
[02:52:22.872 --> 02:52:25.654]  But remember, it's the localized microwaving that's getting you.
[02:52:26.755 --> 02:52:29.317]  But if you are, and I've got all the studies here, if you're
[02:52:30.452 --> 02:52:34.154]  Less than 500, 600 feet away from a tower, you have got to get out of there.
[02:52:35.935 --> 02:52:36.876]  And I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[02:52:36.896 --> 02:52:38.377]  I think I'm going to start the show tomorrow.
[02:52:38.757 --> 02:52:43.119]  I'm going to pull some other studies, and I think I'm just going to do an hour, a whole hour on this.
[02:52:47.121 --> 02:52:56.687]  Because now they're coming out with WiMAX transmitters, which are even worse than all these other microwave systems for the internet.
[02:52:57.728 --> 02:53:04.651]  And they're putting them up all over, and it's fun, it's convenient, but folks, buried cables are the way to go, and they even leak stuff.
[02:53:04.971 --> 02:53:07.792]  It's just, dying of cancer is not fun.
[02:53:09.112 --> 02:53:18.196]  And, you know, I live here in Austin, I don't want to move, but there are just towers everywhere, and I just don't want my family dying.
[02:53:19.656 --> 02:53:24.178]  And, let me just read to you what Europe
[02:53:25.737 --> 02:53:26.237]  Just saying.
[02:53:26.317 --> 02:53:27.258]  Europe in an uproar.
[02:53:27.618 --> 02:53:37.886]  A new European Union poll of more than 27,000 people across the continent reveals that 76% of respondents feel that they are being made ill by wireless transmitters.
[02:53:37.906 --> 02:53:42.409]  71% in the UK believe they suffer health effects from the cell tower mass radiation.
[02:53:42.429 --> 02:53:48.374]  In 2007, the London Times reported a startling number of cancer clusters in main mass neighborhoods.
[02:53:49.315 --> 02:53:54.098]  One study in Warwickshire found 31 cancers around a single street.
[02:53:56.281 --> 02:54:05.048]  Some sick Brits send their blood to a lab in Germany which used state-of-the-art methodology to conduct wireless radiation damage and to confirm it.
[02:54:05.128 --> 02:54:05.968]  Broken DNA.
[02:54:06.849 --> 02:54:14.555]  Folks... Folks, it... I don't even know what to say here.
[02:54:14.575 --> 02:54:17.537]  And this is another thing that I haven't been focusing on.
[02:54:17.557 --> 02:54:22.500]  You know, there was a mean review of Endgame by a pretty big reviewer site.
[02:54:23.461 --> 02:54:24.502]  And the guy was so ignorant.
[02:54:25.174 --> 02:54:28.756]  This Jones makes it up that our government brought thousands of Nazis back to the U.S.
[02:54:29.116 --> 02:54:31.457]  This Jones makes it up that the elite have said they want to kill us.
[02:54:31.817 --> 02:54:34.058]  This Jones makes it up that they're doing this and that.
[02:54:34.258 --> 02:54:37.219]  And everything he claimed I'm making up is publicly available and admitted.
[02:54:38.620 --> 02:54:43.362]  It is high-powered microwave radiation.
[02:54:44.262 --> 02:54:46.303]  From the towers and from the cell phones.
[02:54:46.683 --> 02:54:48.644]  And now they're putting in all the internet wireless.
[02:54:48.704 --> 02:54:52.266]  Now if it's an old-fashioned cordless phone and it's a radio transmission,
[02:54:53.235 --> 02:54:54.356]  That's microscopic.
[02:54:54.496 --> 02:54:55.976]  I mean, comparatively.
[02:54:56.497 --> 02:54:57.677]  And they've done studies on that.
[02:54:58.438 --> 02:55:02.000]  And it's certainly not good for you, but it's negligible.
[02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:04.521]  That's radio.
[02:55:04.661 --> 02:55:06.022]  Radio is one thing.
[02:55:07.382 --> 02:55:16.147]  But you get into a lot of these cell phones now, and they are just high-powered.
[02:55:17.187 --> 02:55:18.548]  I mean, an example of this is,
[02:55:19.472 --> 02:55:23.934]  I can bring a 100-watt FM transmitter in and fire it up right next to computers and equipment.
[02:55:23.954 --> 02:55:24.975]  It doesn't cause a buzz.
[02:55:25.555 --> 02:55:28.977]  When a cell phone rings, it makes the computers in a whole room go wild.
[02:55:29.437 --> 02:55:34.339]  Just the RF radiation going into the cables is broadcasting through them.
[02:55:35.940 --> 02:55:38.561]  I mean, it's high power, folks.
[02:55:41.103 --> 02:55:43.284]  And we're going to be doing a lot more on this, okay?
[02:55:43.344 --> 02:55:45.465]  I've covered it a lot in the past, but not in enough detail.
[02:55:47.176 --> 02:55:49.277]  I literally read four pages of twelve pages.
