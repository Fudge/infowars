[00:00:02.488 --> 00:00:05.990]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview.
[00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.834]  Scrap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:13.196]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.458]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:19.360]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.603]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.505]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:31.954 --> 00:00:36.577]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:46.122]  It is Sunday, the 28th day of January, 2007.
[00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.964]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:51.946]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours.
[00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:57.069]  I do a weekday syndicated radio program on over 60 stations.
[00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:02.757]  I am a paleo-conservative, not a modern fake neocon-conservative.
[00:01:03.538 --> 00:01:07.480]  I was basically what you can call a classical libertarian.
[00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.762]  I believe in the Constitution and the Republic.
[00:01:09.842 --> 00:01:13.404]  I defend the Bill of Rights and Constitution from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:23.031]  I am not wedded to the Democratic or Republican parties who are both bought and paid for by corporate interest, mainly foreign lobbyist-controlled interest.
[00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:35.784]  And I'm introducing myself, as I do every few weeks as we get more affiliates, because it's important for listeners to understand that I'm not some liberal and I'm not some modern type conservative.
[00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:52.371]  I'm an individual who tries to cover the facts, cover the real news, and give you the best information I can about how to save this free market society, how we can save this supposedly free country that is losing so many of its liberties and freedoms and being usurped by foreign interest.
[00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:54.973]  This has been an amazing week.
[00:01:56.054 --> 00:02:11.489]  I have been so busy that I didn't get down to my other broadcast studio to get a list of five new affiliates that are picking up the show this week, but I will plug you next week and I will thank you and put links on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com, my three major websites.
[00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:19.881]  So that everybody who's listening to us on the internet or shortwave or satellite in those areas can tune in on those great affiliates.
[00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:27.633]  So one of the great stations slash Sinclair stations in Norfolk, a 50,000 watt mega blowtorch blasting into four states is picking us up.
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.344]  A station in Jacksonville, Florida, right on the border with Georgia, that covers four cities, is now picking us up today.
[00:02:34.784 --> 00:02:37.505]  Two stations in northern New York.
[00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.267]  One, of course, there in Niagara.
[00:02:40.347 --> 00:02:43.249]  Another in Rochester are picking us up right now.
[00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.030]  A new station in Illinois.
[00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.931]  Another station in Ohio.
[00:02:47.011 --> 00:02:48.352]  I'm sorry, that's six stations.
[00:02:48.712 --> 00:02:51.634]  And there's another ten or so that are going to be picking us up next week.
[00:02:51.974 --> 00:02:54.996]  We started this new syndicated broadcast three months ago.
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:18.904]  and uh... it's the first show syndicated by MS Communications and I'm very very excited about that working with my syndicator of the GCN Radio Network and so enough said I want to thank all those affiliates the sponsors I want to thank Trey Kincaid in there running the show I want to thank Mark Caesar here at the Mothership where we broadcast out of KLBJ NewsRadio, KLBJ 590 also of MS Communications.
[00:03:19.104 --> 00:03:19.384]  Alright!
[00:03:20.425 --> 00:03:22.245]  We have a huge guest coming up in
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.280]  Twenty minutes.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.663]  And by huge, I interviewed legendary director and writer David Lynch earlier this week, and I would call that a huge guest.
[00:03:31.683 --> 00:03:36.944]  Or when I interview Charlton Heston or Charlie Sheen or folks in the Gibson family, those are huge guests.
[00:03:36.984 --> 00:03:38.465]  Or when I interview a senator, it's a huge guest.
[00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:40.025]  Or when I interview a head of state, it's a huge guest.
[00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:42.346]  But I think this is a bigger, more important guest
[00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:51.551]  Because this is just such a massive story that I just discovered this morning that I've been working on all day long vetting and researching, and it was worse than I first thought.
[00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:59.017]  This will be breaking in the mainstream newspaper Human Events tomorrow, also World Net Daily, but you're going to hear it here first in all of its detail.
[00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:12.107]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, no matter where you live, whether it's in the Carolinas or in Virginia or Illinois or California, listening to the sound of my voice or right here in Texas today or this evening,
[00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:24.617]  It affects you to have massive toll roads being put in on existing roads and new fully paid for state and federal highways all over the country.
[00:04:25.478 --> 00:04:26.959]  And that's happening right now.
[00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:37.749]  And what we're going to be talking about is Texas and Oklahoma, but this affects you especially in states like Illinois, Virginia, Florida,
[00:04:38.793 --> 00:04:49.158]  Washington State, Texas, New York, New Jersey, it's a lot of the states, but those are some of the big ones, because the same companies, Indiana, really bad, the same companies are doing this.
[00:04:49.218 --> 00:05:02.744]  In partnership, Centra Spanish Owned, another company, huge conglomerate, that is Australian owned, are taking control of 8,000 miles of Texas roads, most of it already existing, and putting coal roads on these existing roads.
[00:05:03.044 --> 00:05:04.825]  Now that was illegal until last year.
[00:05:04.885 --> 00:05:05.545]  George Bush,
[00:05:06.423 --> 00:05:12.507]  The same guy that wants blanket amnesty for all the illegal aliens, the fake conservative, the guy that wanted to sign the assault weapons ban but it got defeated, thank God.
[00:05:12.867 --> 00:05:20.933]  The same phony conservative that so many conservatives mindlessly follow, signed an executive order saying no foreign interest can own U.S.
[00:05:21.013 --> 00:05:21.673]  existing roads.
[00:05:22.134 --> 00:05:28.338]  Just like he tried to give not 7, not 10, not 21, when it ended up it was 37 U.S.
[00:05:28.398 --> 00:05:28.718]  ports.
[00:05:28.738 --> 00:05:30.740]  Remember Dubai, the Arabs?
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.641]  Well this dwarfs that because
[00:05:33.394 --> 00:05:36.317]  All countries operate off their roads and railways, but the U.S.
[00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:52.274]  is sprawling, it's designed on roads more than any other nation in the world, under the great policies of Dwight D. Eisenhower, who built over 100 major federal highways, 83 of those going under federal control, federal website, SPP.gov, Security and Prosperity Partnership, which is the North American Union.
[00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:54.897]  You've seen Lou Dobbs talking about it, the New World Order, the takeover.
[00:05:55.237 --> 00:06:03.464]  They're going to use these roads, seizing existing roads, signing them over to foreign toll companies, because they agreed to pay into the North American Union Fund to build roads.
[00:06:03.605 --> 00:06:05.406]  We will pay for roads in Mexico and Canada.
[00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:06.587]  That's mainstream news.
[00:06:07.708 --> 00:06:11.632]  The reason this interview is so big is Shell Costillo, the founder of Texas Toll Party,
[00:06:12.367 --> 00:06:29.800]  The guy who's beaten so many of these toll roads in Texas, the guy that joined up with the city manager down in a suburb of Houston, David Stahl, former police officer as well, who's gotten the majority of Texas counties to sign on to sue the state and sue these private companies to block them grabbing 10 miles of property on each side.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:33.743]  Remember the Supreme Court ruling last year that private interest can take your land without just compensation?
[00:06:34.144 --> 00:06:35.625]  It ties into all of that.
[00:06:35.705 --> 00:06:38.347]  We're beating them, so guess what they've done?
[00:06:39.088 --> 00:06:49.759]  This Australian-slash-Spanish-owned consortium just bought, hold on to your hat, 800 newspapers in Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.763]  And we've overlaid the map of the newspapers they're buying.
[00:06:53.023 --> 00:06:58.469]  They're all in these counties and these cities on every major toll road or planned toll road.
[00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:00.691]  And these are the papers that were critical.
[00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:05.188]  Like the Waxahachie paper or the papers here outside Austin.
[00:07:05.668 --> 00:07:07.109]  It's unbelievable.
[00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:08.050]  Yes, you heard me.
[00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.614]  They're buying up the newspapers because Texans and Oklahomans and others are defeating this.
[00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:20.679]  The Trans-Napta Highway goes right through Austin from southern Mexico on I-35 right up into Canada.
[00:07:21.219 --> 00:07:22.880]  This is all happening.
[00:07:23.221 --> 00:07:24.601]  Putting toll roads in Phase 3.
[00:07:24.642 --> 00:07:25.662]  They're already past Phase 1.
[00:07:26.203 --> 00:07:27.323]  We're trying to shoot down Phase 2.
[00:07:27.944 --> 00:07:29.065]  This is massive.
[00:07:30.146 --> 00:07:37.906]  To all the new affiliates in upstate New York, and for the affiliates in Virginia, and for affiliates in Illinois, and for everybody tuning in today.
[00:07:39.612 --> 00:07:40.713]  Right here in Central Texas.
[00:07:40.833 --> 00:07:45.838]  Texas is the front line, and Sal Castillo will be joining us to go over this.
[00:07:46.158 --> 00:07:49.842]  Then later in the second hour, we'll also have phone calls throughout the transmission.
[00:07:49.862 --> 00:07:49.902]  877-590-5525.
[00:07:49.922 --> 00:07:50.222]  That's 877-590-KLBJ.
[00:07:50.242 --> 00:07:54.306]  Or locally in Central Texas, if you're listening to The Mothership, it's Radio 590-KLBJ 836-0590.
[00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:08.191]  Reprises a famous role at Peace Rally.
[00:08:08.691 --> 00:08:10.512]  An actress speaks out against the war in Iraq.
[00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:11.472]  This happened yesterday.
[00:08:12.452 --> 00:08:14.913]  I'm against the war, but I'm also against Jane Fonda.
[00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:21.035]  And we're going to break down why the extreme far left does more damage than good by being anti-war.
[00:08:21.055 --> 00:08:34.840]  Because conservatives see people like her that got up on top of Vietnamese chi-com, communist Vietnamese, anti-aircraft guns, while some of them next to her were firing at our planes, is traitorous,
[00:08:36.036 --> 00:08:38.038]  And I'm not even attacking Jane Fonda here.
[00:08:38.078 --> 00:08:43.521]  The point is, she ought to have her head screwed on straight enough to know, and I'm against this war too.
[00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:45.703]  Even Oliver North now is against the troop surge.
[00:08:46.303 --> 00:08:47.564]  But I want to be clear about this.
[00:08:47.644 --> 00:08:54.889]  Jane Fonda needs to, she can go speak out if she wants, but she needs to realize it would be better if she just shut her traitorous mouth.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:04.363]  I'll just leave it at that, because I want this war to end, and what she's doing is only going to energize the people that have been sucked in and conned by this war for a new world order.
[00:09:04.683 --> 00:09:05.443]  So we'll break that down.
[00:09:05.464 --> 00:09:13.666]  The last 30 minutes of the show coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes or so, we'll spend 30 minutes on that and take your call.
[00:09:13.706 --> 00:09:14.507]  So that's coming up later.
[00:09:14.867 --> 00:09:16.808]  Also, ridiculous news headlines.
[00:09:17.068 --> 00:09:18.068]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:09:18.508 --> 00:09:20.529]  Internet to revolutionize TV in five years.
[00:09:20.589 --> 00:09:20.849]  Gates.
[00:09:21.804 --> 00:09:25.665]  YouTube has over 100 million individual viewers a week.
[00:09:26.246 --> 00:09:29.587]  That's already bigger than all three of the networks combined.
[00:09:30.147 --> 00:09:32.428]  It isn't going to revolutionize, Gates.
[00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:33.288]  It has.
[00:09:34.528 --> 00:09:36.909]  I have millions of viewers on my videos a week.
[00:09:37.189 --> 00:09:37.729]  Millions.
[00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:41.090]  I've had hundreds of millions in the last two years.
[00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:42.751]  I'm one small part of this.
[00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:43.911]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:44.552 --> 00:09:44.992]  Stay with us.
[00:09:45.252 --> 00:09:45.892]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:09:48.999 --> 00:09:52.042]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:56.310]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:11.982]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:11:12.183 --> 00:11:14.924]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:16.085]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.426 --> 00:11:22.029]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:30.215]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:11:31.216 --> 00:11:34.258]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:11:36.411 --> 00:11:39.874]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:11:40.855 --> 00:11:42.136]  Call for your copy today.
[00:11:42.376 --> 00:11:44.578]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:51.484]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:11:52.205 --> 00:11:52.585]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:52.646 --> 00:11:52.846]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.092]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:12:07.432 --> 00:12:09.394]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:12:09.754 --> 00:12:17.439]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:12:18.099 --> 00:12:25.183]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:12:25.564 --> 00:12:32.448]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:12:32.924 --> 00:12:36.967]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:12:37.267 --> 00:12:40.770]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:43.171]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:47.414]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:12:47.955 --> 00:12:55.400]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:02.831]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.416]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:13:05.476 --> 00:13:10.187]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:17.653]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:31.056]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:13:31.516 --> 00:13:35.477]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:13:35.957 --> 00:13:37.237]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:14:06.528 --> 00:14:12.332]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:14:12.652 --> 00:14:15.674]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[00:14:16.495 --> 00:14:18.876]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[00:14:24.159 --> 00:14:28.802]  Welcome back on this live 28th of January 2007 edition.
[00:14:28.842 --> 00:14:34.066]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour after the news, we're going to have Sal Castello
[00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:40.990]  The founder of the Texas Gold Party fighting the international takeover of our roads to tax us internationally.
[00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:42.831]  This is part of the global tax.
[00:14:42.871 --> 00:14:49.455]  The globalists also want to tax on money transfers and bank accounts and international stock transactions.
[00:14:49.495 --> 00:14:52.037]  They want a tax at the wellhead on oil.
[00:14:52.477 --> 00:14:55.479]  They're moving out on all of it with their global court, their global banks.
[00:14:56.159 --> 00:15:09.183]  They're global laws, it's all happening, and George Bush and the Democrats are all working together to make sure that it happens and the North American Union to be merged with the European Union, and they announced two months ago the formation of the Asian Union.
[00:15:09.243 --> 00:15:10.024]  It is all happening.
[00:15:10.044 --> 00:15:11.564]  In fact, let's start covering this now.
[00:15:12.365 --> 00:15:16.646]  Toll Road Giant buys newspapers to silence critics.
[00:15:17.307 --> 00:15:25.969]  Critics charge that the mercury purchase of American Consolidated Media is designed to silence critics of a Texas toll road project.
[00:15:26.807 --> 00:15:40.980]  Australian toll road giant, Mercury, agreed Wednesday to purchase 40 local newspapers, and that's part of a total 800-plus purchase, primarily in Texas and Oklahoma, for $80 million.
[00:15:41.161 --> 00:15:49.809]  Mercury Bank is Australia's largest capital-raising firm and has invested billions in purchasing roads in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., mostly in Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:50.570]  Yes, we are.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.864]  of Spain in a controversial 75-year lease of a 175-mile Indiana toll road.
[00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:25.391]  Sal Costello, the leading opponent of toll road projects, as head of the Texas Toll Party, says the move is directly related to a 4,000-mile toll road project known as the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:26.872]  And I think this newspaper got it wrong.
[00:16:27.312 --> 00:16:29.834]  This is also being reported in the Sydney Morning Herald and other publications.
[00:16:30.595 --> 00:16:35.218]  It's the Governor, Perry, who's all for it, biggest contributors to these toll companies,
[00:16:35.914 --> 00:16:40.678]  Next to that, Mexico-controlled companies, and his head lobbyist and head of his Mexico-U.S.
[00:16:40.718 --> 00:16:43.060]  relations is not a U.S.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.161]  citizen, he's a Mexican citizen.
[00:16:44.861 --> 00:16:46.783]  But again, there's just so much background on all of this.
[00:16:46.803 --> 00:16:48.724]  It's actually 8,000 miles in Texas.
[00:16:49.465 --> 00:16:56.251]  It will cost between $145 and $183 billion to construct the road, which the state of Texas pays for, and then the total company just manages.
[00:16:56.271 --> 00:17:05.138]  It's expected to be up to 1,200 feet wide, requiring the acquisition of 9,000 square miles of land and areas through which it will pass.
[00:17:05.658 --> 00:17:13.620]  The newspapers are the main communication tool for some of the rural Texas communities, with many citizens at risk of losing their homes and farms through eminent domain.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.600]  There's still a road.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:21.281]  Many of the small papers purchased, most of a circulation of 5,000 or less, have been critical of the trans-Texas corridor.
[00:17:21.602 --> 00:17:27.983]  An article in the Bonham Journal, for example, states, the Texas toll roads will be under control of foreign investors.
[00:17:29.105 --> 00:17:31.707]  Which more than frustrates Texans.
[00:17:32.388 --> 00:17:35.370]  And I have a huge stack of news articles on this.
[00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:43.296]  We have links up on my website, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com covering this subject.
[00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:46.638]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:17:46.858 --> 00:17:48.179]  I've been in the studio three months.
[00:17:48.199 --> 00:17:50.521]  They've already got a brand new phone system in here.
[00:17:50.901 --> 00:17:55.205]  So I will try my best here.
[00:17:55.285 --> 00:17:57.947]  Let's talk to Adam in Lancaster, PA.
[00:17:58.974 --> 00:18:00.294]  And you're on the air, Adam.
[00:18:00.334 --> 00:18:01.094]  Thank you for calling.
[00:18:03.395 --> 00:18:03.755]  Go ahead.
[00:18:03.795 --> 00:18:04.795]  You're on the air.
[00:18:04.815 --> 00:18:05.715]  Yep.
[00:18:05.975 --> 00:18:06.456]  How you doing?
[00:18:06.636 --> 00:18:07.296]  Good, sir.
[00:18:07.776 --> 00:18:12.357]  I just wanted to call and tell you about the protest yesterday down in D.C.
[00:18:12.457 --> 00:18:19.058]  I was down there and I handed out over 100 DVDs on 9-11 Truth and over 100 flyers myself.
[00:18:20.138 --> 00:18:23.219]  And I felt that 9-11 Truth had a very
[00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:26.091]  Big show there.
[00:18:26.831 --> 00:18:36.175]  I heard that and I heard Jesse Jackson wouldn't talk about it so a bunch of 9-11 truthers got video running up and telling him how dare you cover up the fact that 9-11 is an inside job.
[00:18:36.676 --> 00:18:39.437]  Exactly, actually I was right there Alex.
[00:18:39.457 --> 00:18:42.118]  A lot of 9-11 truth people were coming backstage.
[00:18:42.398 --> 00:18:43.799]  Yeah, these are controlled left.
[00:18:44.059 --> 00:18:48.301]  They're to neutralize the left in this country and make sure the new order takes place.
[00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:51.254]  You're right, and people weren't listening to them.
[00:18:51.394 --> 00:18:54.755]  In my opinion, people really weren't listening to a lot of speakers.
[00:18:54.795 --> 00:18:55.796]  They were fed up.
[00:18:56.296 --> 00:18:57.817]  They didn't want to hear these actors.
[00:18:58.177 --> 00:19:03.519]  And people are going to the backstage area to confront people directly, like Jesse.
[00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:08.541]  You've got Susan Sarandon, and you've got Jane Fonda, and they're not stupid.
[00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:11.422]  They know that this energizes the fake right in this country.
[00:19:11.442 --> 00:19:15.904]  See, the fake right has to have a fake left to make the right look good.
[00:19:15.944 --> 00:19:17.385]  It's like good cop, bad cop.
[00:19:17.885 --> 00:19:18.846]  And I'm anti-war.
[00:19:18.906 --> 00:19:19.706]  I'm against this war.
[00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:22.247]  70% of the Tribs and Poles are against it.
[00:19:22.267 --> 00:19:23.708]  78% of Americans and Poles are against it.
[00:19:24.008 --> 00:19:33.953]  So they have a bunch of clowns out there who basically drop the ball by design and the media gives it a bunch of coverage and it makes it look like you're a pinko commie basically if you're against this war.
[00:19:34.293 --> 00:19:34.973]  Good to hear from you.
[00:19:34.993 --> 00:19:37.814]  I'm glad you were there and I'm glad that you called.
[00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:40.856]  Let's talk to Emily in Ohio.
[00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:42.657]  You're blasting out worldwide.
[00:19:42.697 --> 00:19:43.017]  Welcome.
[00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.431]  Hey, Alex, I wanted to tell you about the group at school.
[00:19:46.471 --> 00:19:48.431]  It's going pretty good, but I have one problem.
[00:19:48.891 --> 00:19:51.432]  One of my teachers dropped out on it and said that she couldn't do it.
[00:19:51.592 --> 00:19:52.472]  Okay, let me stop you.
[00:19:52.512 --> 00:19:55.393]  You called my syndicated show, what, last Monday?
[00:19:55.413 --> 00:19:56.533]  I do a Monday through Friday show.
[00:19:57.153 --> 00:20:03.015]  You're 15 years old in Ohio, and you set up a 9-11 truth group exposing the fact that 9-11 is a cover-up.
[00:20:03.075 --> 00:20:04.135]  It's 84% of Americans.
[00:20:04.455 --> 00:20:07.436]  An Angus and Reed poll reported in December of last year.
[00:20:07.896 --> 00:20:11.517]  Also an ABC News poll and a Wall Street Journal poll found in the high 80s or low 80s.
[00:20:12.117 --> 00:20:13.537]  Uh, depending on which poll as well.
[00:20:13.857 --> 00:20:15.938]  And to have a student group, you have to be certified.
[00:20:15.978 --> 00:20:18.638]  The teachers have a vote, which shows what a police state we're in.
[00:20:18.918 --> 00:20:21.319]  So now one of the teachers is refusing to certify your group?
[00:20:21.619 --> 00:20:22.899]  Yeah, they have to find out.
[00:20:22.919 --> 00:20:27.640]  She went and found out all the information about what the group was going to be like, and then she went and dropped out of it.
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.320]  Okay, it's fine.
[00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:30.461]  You tell everybody it's a banned group at school.
[00:20:30.561 --> 00:20:32.341]  You have it off school with chaperones.
[00:20:32.381 --> 00:20:33.321]  It'll be ten times bigger.
[00:20:33.761 --> 00:20:34.001]  Yeah.
[00:20:34.381 --> 00:20:36.062]  I plan on doing it no matter what.
[00:20:36.122 --> 00:20:37.202]  I'm going to do whatever it takes.
[00:20:37.322 --> 00:20:40.403]  So, so, so, so she went and saw it and said, no, I'm not going to be part of this?
[00:20:41.483 --> 00:20:41.683]  Huh?
[00:20:42.529 --> 00:20:45.290]  Well, again, at your school you said the teachers have to vote and certify it.
[00:20:45.330 --> 00:20:47.551]  Yeah, at my school they have to vote on it.
[00:20:47.591 --> 00:20:50.032]  And if just one teacher doesn't go along with it, you can?
[00:20:50.712 --> 00:20:54.994]  Well, if one teacher doesn't go along, like if I get like 90-some votes, then I can do it.
[00:20:58.302 --> 00:21:02.444]  I need you to write this up in an email with your parents' permission.
[00:21:02.464 --> 00:21:08.188]  I need to receive an email from your parents with their names and your phone number so I can talk to them and then write a story about this.
[00:21:08.328 --> 00:21:14.613]  I really cannot sit here and tell you to do things at school or what you should do until I've talked to your parents.
[00:21:14.633 --> 00:21:19.116]  I know you said last week your parents are all for this, but I need to be able to write a story about this.
[00:21:19.656 --> 00:21:21.918]  So have your parents contact me and I appreciate your call.
[00:21:22.598 --> 00:21:25.480]  All right, young people taking action here in the U.S.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.503]  to defend our Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:21:30.803 --> 00:21:33.145]  Let's talk to David in New Jersey.
[00:21:33.165 --> 00:21:35.827]  He's talking about MySpace and school.
[00:21:36.427 --> 00:21:37.148]  You're on the air.
[00:21:37.188 --> 00:21:37.828]  Thank you for holding.
[00:21:38.909 --> 00:21:39.089]  What?
[00:21:40.009 --> 00:21:42.151]  Okay, your name is David from New Jersey.
[00:21:42.231 --> 00:21:42.991]  I just went to you.
[00:21:43.111 --> 00:21:43.452]  Go ahead.
[00:21:43.472 --> 00:21:45.973]  All of a sudden, I heard like... Yeah, that's what it does.
[00:21:46.053 --> 00:21:48.035]  It's to let you know on talk radio you're on air.
[00:21:48.055 --> 00:21:49.335]  Okay.
[00:21:49.956 --> 00:21:50.636]  What's up, Alex?
[00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:51.657]  You're doing a great job.
[00:21:52.333 --> 00:21:54.334]  And you're just fighting the New World Order.
[00:21:54.354 --> 00:21:57.877]  You're... I don't know what you're doing, but... You're pwning it, you know?
[00:21:58.797 --> 00:22:02.120]  So... Everybody, go on to AlexJonesIsMySpace.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.623]  I put a huge list of all your movies, and all everybody else's movies, and a lot of truth movies.
[00:22:06.643 --> 00:22:08.084]  154 of them.
[00:22:08.804 --> 00:22:10.906]  And... You're the guy that puts all the red text up there.
[00:22:10.946 --> 00:22:11.506]  Good job.
[00:22:12.226 --> 00:22:12.607]  Thank you.
[00:22:13.047 --> 00:22:19.511]  And, um, I'm being a good little activist, and I talked my teacher at school into letting me bring in some Constitution class movies.
[00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:20.312]  How old are you?
[00:22:21.421 --> 00:22:24.084]  I'm 16, I go to... Okay, I'm going to put you on hold, sir.
[00:22:24.104 --> 00:22:25.345]  I'm going to come back to you, okay?
[00:22:25.565 --> 00:22:26.886]  We're going to come back to you after the break.
[00:22:26.926 --> 00:22:28.408]  I want to hear this and we'll go to Sal Costello.
[00:22:29.229 --> 00:22:29.669]  I love it!
[00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:31.971]  I mean, these young people are the key to this show.
[00:22:32.211 --> 00:22:39.738]  But you look at our ratings demographics, it's 80-year-olds, it's black people, it's Hispanic, but the most strongest group is the young people.
[00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:42.841]  We're talking 12-years-olds and 25 or so.

[00:24:35.066 --> 00:24:35.806]  Thank you.
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:02.521]  Shelly, you make exu... Oh, wait!
[00:25:02.661 --> 00:25:03.741]  Why did you turn that down?
[00:25:03.761 --> 00:25:06.362]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[00:25:06.842 --> 00:25:11.343]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[00:25:11.523 --> 00:25:13.964]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[00:25:14.224 --> 00:25:15.424]  I can do something like that.
[00:25:15.444 --> 00:25:17.845]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[00:25:17.965 --> 00:25:20.866]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[00:25:20.926 --> 00:25:22.726]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[00:25:22.826 --> 00:25:25.087]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[00:25:25.467 --> 00:25:26.087]  I guess you're right.
[00:25:26.487 --> 00:25:27.167]  Why don't we try it?
[00:25:27.347 --> 00:25:29.288]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[00:25:29.736 --> 00:25:34.138]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[00:25:34.438 --> 00:25:35.799]  I know where we can get some more information.
[00:25:36.179 --> 00:25:40.541]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.

[00:26:01.434 --> 00:26:02.315]  It's no secret.
[00:26:02.595 --> 00:26:08.059]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[00:26:08.239 --> 00:26:13.003]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[00:26:13.343 --> 00:26:15.645]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[00:26:15.845 --> 00:26:18.447]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called Novo.
[00:26:18.687 --> 00:26:26.814]  Novo eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[00:26:27.014 --> 00:26:31.197]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in Novo.
[00:26:31.537 --> 00:26:37.760]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[00:26:37.941 --> 00:26:42.103]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.

[00:27:06.144 --> 00:27:07.065]  We've got you covered.
[00:27:07.105 --> 00:27:09.346]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[00:27:10.686 --> 00:27:15.728]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:18.429 --> 00:27:19.550]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:29.103]  Welcome to the Sunday edition, I do, right here out of the studios of NewsRadio 590KLVJ, syndicated across the country.
[00:27:29.143 --> 00:27:34.185]  A lot of stations turning us on, and next week I'll thank a lot of those new stations that have joined us.
[00:27:35.658 --> 00:27:37.599]  Sal Castillo is going to be on with us in just a moment.
[00:27:37.639 --> 00:27:39.980]  The founder and the head of the Texas Stole Party.
[00:27:40.361 --> 00:27:41.501]  The big fights here in Texas.
[00:27:41.521 --> 00:27:51.646]  This is a national issue of foreign companies coming in, lobbying, taking over major existing roads and the new roads and then using that to tax for the North American Union.
[00:27:52.007 --> 00:28:00.511]  Huge development with one of the biggest consortiums, Spanish slash Australian owned, but it's mainly the Australian arm doing this.
[00:28:00.891 --> 00:28:02.092]  Buying up a whole bunch of
[00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:06.533]  Texas and Oklahoma newspapers that have been vocal against it.
[00:28:06.553 --> 00:28:20.185]  This is huge because we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars over the years with these toll roads just in the first few phases and this is what big business does and they have words for it and we're going to be going over what this really means.
[00:28:20.606 --> 00:28:27.132]  But I wanted to briefly give him a chance to finish up and that was David in New Jersey
[00:28:27.754 --> 00:28:29.615]  Can we bring David back up here?
[00:28:30.095 --> 00:28:36.738]  David, you're a young person, you said 16, in high school, and you were trying to bring constitutions to school and class.
[00:28:36.778 --> 00:28:37.239]  What happened?
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.421]  I didn't do that yet.
[00:28:41.461 --> 00:28:42.641]  That was supposed to be tomorrow.
[00:28:42.841 --> 00:28:43.662]  Okay, I was confused.
[00:28:43.682 --> 00:28:45.563]  You said you were going to bring these to school.
[00:28:45.843 --> 00:28:46.483]  What are you bringing up?
[00:28:46.523 --> 00:28:46.923]  What happened?
[00:28:49.065 --> 00:28:49.986]  Tell me your story, sir.
[00:28:50.306 --> 00:28:51.627]  I'm preparing to do that.
[00:28:51.667 --> 00:28:52.287]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:28:52.587 --> 00:28:56.310]  DVDs tonight, I'm gonna bring them in tomorrow, and teacher's gonna review them.
[00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:59.231]  She's not brainwashed or anything, you know, like... But she has to review?
[00:28:59.252 --> 00:29:00.372]  I mean, why hand them out in class?
[00:29:00.412 --> 00:29:01.513]  Why not just do it at the lunchroom?
[00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:02.780]  Why not do it after school?
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:03.481]  Well, I can do that.
[00:29:03.761 --> 00:29:07.382]  Yeah, because, you know, these schools say they can decide what you do and what political speech you have.
[00:29:07.562 --> 00:29:12.223]  There was a big case, you probably heard about it a few months ago, at Steiner Elementary.
[00:29:12.724 --> 00:29:22.507]  It happened to be a family that I knew, a 10-year-old, he just turned 11, who, during computer lab, just visited Infowars.com, so he got called a terrorist.
[00:29:22.527 --> 00:29:23.747]  Yeah, I heard about that, I heard about that.
[00:29:23.767 --> 00:29:31.290]  Well, for those that don't know, let me tell them, they called him a terrorist in front of the class, and then they gave him in-school suspension and said that that was an illegal, you know, evil website.
[00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:33.411]  Well, not my school, but I will be extra careful.
[00:29:33.431 --> 00:29:33.711]  I will be.
[00:29:33.731 --> 00:29:36.333]  Thirdly, this is David telling you peeps that we need to work together.
[00:29:36.393 --> 00:29:38.835]  We can go into the schools, we can spread the truth, but you can't.
[00:29:57.617 --> 00:30:00.544]  Now you guys need to vote for Ron Paul, right?
[00:30:00.624 --> 00:30:02.489]  Running for president, yeah.
[00:30:03.371 --> 00:30:04.453]  And we can't do that.
[00:30:04.533 --> 00:30:06.297]  We're, you know, 16 and below.
[00:30:07.153 --> 00:30:08.054]  And we need your help.
[00:30:08.074 --> 00:30:08.834]  We need to work together.
[00:30:08.854 --> 00:30:12.616]  You need to stop them from giving us mandatory vaccinations every year.
[00:30:12.636 --> 00:30:13.157]  It's horrible.
[00:30:13.177 --> 00:30:14.077]  I hate that stuff.
[00:30:14.217 --> 00:30:15.638]  Well, they're not really mandatory.
[00:30:15.678 --> 00:30:16.799]  They claim to be in school.
[00:30:16.819 --> 00:30:18.320]  You've got to have them, but there's no law.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:20.861]  But they have a waiver in their desk they don't tell you about.
[00:30:21.122 --> 00:30:25.644]  Then they kick you out, and then they try to put charges on your parents for truancy because they kicked you out.
[00:30:25.704 --> 00:30:26.365]  It's all a fraud.
[00:30:27.105 --> 00:30:29.667]  Let's go ahead and go to Sal Costello.
[00:30:30.327 --> 00:30:31.748]  This is a huge story.
[00:30:32.168 --> 00:30:34.630]  You know, most weeks I don't get up here and say, this is huge, this is incredible.
[00:30:35.393 --> 00:30:38.614]  Understand, it is in the Australian papers, it is in a couple U.S.
[00:30:38.654 --> 00:30:43.555]  papers just calmly announcing, hey this big Australian company is buying a bunch of U.S.
[00:30:43.595 --> 00:30:45.476]  newspapers, mainly in Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:30:45.596 --> 00:30:46.736]  All these little small papers.
[00:30:47.176 --> 00:30:50.737]  You look at the map of Texas and Oklahoma, it's where all the major toll roads are.
[00:30:51.417 --> 00:30:51.777]  Okay?
[00:30:52.438 --> 00:30:54.738]  And this is just absolutely amazing.
[00:30:55.018 --> 00:30:59.839]  The purchase allows one of the largest toll road operations in the world to control some of its industries.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.740]  Most outspoken critics in Texas
[00:31:02.538 --> 00:31:05.904]  Dozens and dozens and dozens of rural independent Texas newspapers.
[00:31:06.665 --> 00:31:08.348]  And this is incredible.
[00:31:08.368 --> 00:31:14.780]  By the way, The Statesman will post, and of course it's not being bought, but it's already part of this whole system, The Statesman will publish
[00:31:15.379 --> 00:31:23.964]  Pro-toll road stories, but it won't publish, or that is letters of the editor, here in Austin, but it will not publish the ones that are anti-toll road.
[00:31:23.984 --> 00:31:29.207]  Well, they'll publish what the former Austin mayor, state senator, Kirk Watson, in all his shenanigans says.
[00:31:29.567 --> 00:31:36.211]  Again, that's because you have 97% of the Houston Chronicle poll against seizing existing roads and having international bodies take them over.
[00:31:36.831 --> 00:31:37.932]  They're not even really paying for them.
[00:31:37.952 --> 00:31:39.473]  They're paying a paltry sum.
[00:31:39.893 --> 00:31:40.693]  Here's an analogy.
[00:31:40.994 --> 00:31:43.475]  The AP reported three days ago, or an example, a parallel,
[00:31:44.741 --> 00:31:52.363]  Three days ago, the AP reported that the Michigan lottery makes $700 million a year.
[00:31:52.403 --> 00:31:53.263]  It made $700 million in 2006.
[00:31:53.603 --> 00:31:56.063]  And it made $600 something million the year before.
[00:31:56.964 --> 00:32:04.165]  They are handing that over to a foreign company owned by a European nation, inside a European nation.
[00:32:04.465 --> 00:32:06.746]  They're handing that over for $1 billion.
[00:32:06.786 --> 00:32:11.466]  Now is that what you normally pay?
[00:32:11.546 --> 00:32:11.747]  No.
[00:32:12.587 --> 00:32:12.747]  No.
[00:32:13.287 --> 00:32:13.967]  You don't normally
[00:32:15.814 --> 00:32:16.955]  You'd pay many times that.
[00:32:17.395 --> 00:32:19.455]  So, for a billion bucks, they get it.
[00:32:19.475 --> 00:32:20.956]  And of course, in the schools, they'll get nothing.
[00:32:21.376 --> 00:32:22.216]  I mean, this is how it works.
[00:32:22.256 --> 00:32:23.096]  We're being looted.
[00:32:23.436 --> 00:32:24.317]  We're being taken over.
[00:32:24.357 --> 00:32:28.298]  It was like that lease, almost for nothing, to give them 30-something ports.
[00:32:28.358 --> 00:32:31.918]  It wasn't 7, it wasn't 20, it was 30-something ports to Dubai.
[00:32:32.259 --> 00:32:33.359]  This is globalization.
[00:32:34.199 --> 00:32:35.279]  Let's go to Sal Costello.
[00:32:35.319 --> 00:32:38.360]  Sal, thank you so much for coming on with us, sir.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.440]  I really appreciate you.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.481]  For those that don't know who you are, tell our listeners.
[00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:45.931]  Well, I'm actually the founder of a couple of websites.
[00:32:46.051 --> 00:32:51.152]  I started AustinTollParty.com and TexasTollParty.com, People for Efficient Transportation.
[00:32:52.152 --> 00:32:59.974]  And we're sort of on the front line here in Central Texas, where they're seeking the toll roads we've already paid for, for the first time in our country.
[00:32:59.994 --> 00:33:08.136]  And then, of course, we also are fighting the Trans-Texas Corridor, which is part of the NAFTA superhighway, as we're finding out.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.221]  and will be used to fund building roads in Mexico.
[00:33:11.261 --> 00:33:13.121]  That's on the SPP.gov, the U.S.
[00:33:13.141 --> 00:33:14.502]  government's own website.
[00:33:15.922 --> 00:33:21.804]  Here in Austin, in the first three phases, phase one now in, you won't be able to go anywhere on a major road.
[00:33:21.824 --> 00:33:24.445]  We're talking 14 plus of these if they get their way.
[00:33:24.745 --> 00:33:25.485]  They're claiming that
[00:33:26.267 --> 00:33:35.774]  Phase 2 has been shelved for now, but Kirk Watson on the CAMPO board that controls this, this unelected group, is saying they're just going to vote on it in executive session.
[00:33:35.794 --> 00:33:37.055]  But I want to get into that later.
[00:33:37.095 --> 00:33:38.536]  But again, this is a national issue.
[00:33:38.556 --> 00:33:40.177]  This is happening all over the place.
[00:33:40.217 --> 00:33:42.278]  Explain how you got involved.
[00:33:42.338 --> 00:33:48.603]  Explain how it's a national issue for people listening in Virginia and Illinois and California and all over the nation.
[00:33:49.003 --> 00:33:53.668]  Explain that, and then let's break down, just in a nutshell, because to me this is unbelievable.
[00:33:53.708 --> 00:33:57.892]  You've got this company coming in, buying up the newspapers that have been most critical to it.
[00:33:58.112 --> 00:33:59.233]  I mean, how obvious is that?
[00:33:59.493 --> 00:34:05.920]  Oh yeah, and you know, this issue, even though it's about toll roads, it's not about toll roads in a way.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:13.307]  It's really about, it's a foreign corporation coming in, and it's about editorial independence.
[00:34:13.897 --> 00:34:42.730]  It's buying these newspapers, dozens of them, and they've had hundreds of stories over the past couple years slamming the Trans-Texas Corridor and these foreign companies coming in that will basically affect, you know, huge numbers of Texans will have to be moved out of their homes, off their farms, off their ranches,
[00:34:43.845 --> 00:34:46.386]  So that this foreign corporation come in and profit.
[00:34:47.126 --> 00:34:53.988]  And basically, they've been very vocal in educating their communities all over Texas.
[00:34:54.289 --> 00:34:56.469]  And tell folks about Corridor Watch with David Stahl.
[00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:58.910]  They have the majority of the counties now signed on to fight it.
[00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:00.170]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:05.372]  I mean, people are learning more and more about this as the months pass.
[00:35:05.972 --> 00:35:10.194]  And so you have these newspapers that are saying, hey, there's something wrong here.
[00:35:10.234 --> 00:35:11.114]  This thing stinks.
[00:35:11.713 --> 00:35:23.846]  And what they're saying is these foreign corporations coming in for profit, and the Trans-Texas Corridor, over the next couple decades, we're talking about close to a $200 billion dollar estimate of contracts.
[00:35:23.906 --> 00:35:27.069]  And isn't this a desperation move by these foreign companies?
[00:35:27.129 --> 00:35:27.810]  Sure, sure.
[00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:31.194]  I mean, here these newspapers are being very vocal.
[00:35:31.878 --> 00:35:43.386]  And this one corporation comes in and buys them up, buys the whole news group, which is dozens of them, and basically this kills editorial independence.
[00:35:43.426 --> 00:35:46.608]  You know, China has a trillion dollars in U.S.
[00:35:46.989 --> 00:35:47.589]  currency.
[00:35:47.809 --> 00:35:51.932]  Would it be okay if China came in and just bought all the media up?
[00:35:51.972 --> 00:35:54.354]  I mean, this is Australia, this is Spain.
[00:35:54.374 --> 00:35:55.775]  I mean, I'm sick of this!
[00:35:56.497 --> 00:36:01.220]  I don't want the Arabs, I don't want the Spanish, I don't want the Aussies coming here and buying up our infrastructure.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.782]  We fight them on that, so then they come in and start buying up our media, which the Arabs have been doing forever.
[00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:11.386]  Well, you know, it is about the foreign interest coming in and buying up our media.
[00:36:11.506 --> 00:36:14.027]  And they come in and lobby our politicians to have it handed over to them.
[00:36:14.327 --> 00:36:21.932]  I had a Nobel Prize winner on two months ago, Joseph Stiklitz, former head of the World Bank, former chief economist, saying this is part of the end game when we go into receivership.
[00:36:22.152 --> 00:36:22.312]  Yes.
[00:36:22.572 --> 00:36:23.793]  This is a military operation.
[00:36:24.133 --> 00:36:27.695]  Well, you know, even if it... but set aside the fact that they're foreign, okay?
[00:36:27.715 --> 00:36:28.455]  That makes it worse.
[00:36:28.515 --> 00:36:34.998]  But let's say that they weren't... let's say that these newspapers were trashing, let's say, for example, Kodak, okay?
[00:36:35.259 --> 00:36:37.560]  For some horrible thing they're doing.
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:40.381]  And then Kodak came and bought it, exactly.
[00:36:40.401 --> 00:36:42.442]  And Kodak comes in and buys up all the papers.
[00:36:42.902 --> 00:36:43.563]  It's still wrong.
[00:36:43.583 --> 00:36:45.303]  It's called racketeering, if we can prove it.
[00:36:45.644 --> 00:36:47.284]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:50.126]  We need grand juries calling these executives in right now.
[00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:52.389]  We'll be right back with Selma Stillo.
[00:36:52.449 --> 00:36:53.170]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:37:01.147 --> 00:37:05.790]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:37:05.850 --> 00:37:06.571]  have diabetes.
[00:37:06.911 --> 00:37:13.856]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:37:13.996 --> 00:37:18.519]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:37:18.739 --> 00:37:21.541]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:38:02.936 --> 00:38:03.676]  Pinch me, Bill.
[00:38:03.956 --> 00:38:04.897]  I can't believe it.
[00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:08.118]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[00:38:08.518 --> 00:38:11.020]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:13.241]  I know what you mean, John.
[00:38:13.261 --> 00:38:17.403]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[00:38:17.983 --> 00:38:21.785]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:21.865 --> 00:38:23.486]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:28.748]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[00:38:29.088 --> 00:38:30.169]  And I owe it all to you.
[00:38:30.749 --> 00:38:34.051]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:34.151 --> 00:38:37.172]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[00:38:37.192 --> 00:38:38.533]  I want to tell everybody.
[00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:42.115]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[00:38:42.475 --> 00:38:44.156]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[00:38:44.416 --> 00:38:47.057]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[00:38:47.197 --> 00:38:53.400]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.501]  What a concept!
[00:39:01.016 --> 00:39:03.380]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.964]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:39:06.025 --> 00:39:07.707]  It's called Wristease.
[00:39:07.768 --> 00:39:10.713]  The new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:39:11.397 --> 00:39:18.201]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:39:18.742 --> 00:39:31.610]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:36.053]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.

[00:39:41.056 --> 00:39:46.582]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:39:46.963 --> 00:39:49.986]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:39:50.367 --> 00:39:51.588]  That's Wristease.

[00:39:57.134 --> 00:39:59.757]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:40:00.572 --> 00:40:05.133]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:40:05.534 --> 00:40:08.475]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:40:08.795 --> 00:40:11.355]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:40:11.716 --> 00:40:16.537]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:40:16.917 --> 00:40:22.299]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:40:22.599 --> 00:40:25.560]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:26.320]  We're good to go.
[00:40:49.153 --> 00:40:54.615]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:40:54.815 --> 00:40:55.595]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:40:55.615 --> 00:40:59.457]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:40:59.497 --> 00:41:06.099]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this
[00:41:18.993 --> 00:41:20.393]  The Alex Jones Show!
[00:41:22.454 --> 00:41:22.714]  HIP!
[00:41:23.254 --> 00:41:23.495]  HIP!
[00:41:24.035 --> 00:41:24.275]  HIP!
[00:41:24.815 --> 00:41:25.055]  HIP!
[00:41:25.475 --> 00:41:26.896]  A New World Order!
[00:41:28.056 --> 00:41:35.979]  Later in the next hour, I'm going to read a bunch of famous New World Order quotes I was unable to finish when I was on with George Norrie, Friday, co-hosting with him the last two hours here in Austin.
[00:41:36.019 --> 00:41:39.320]  He was here for TalkFest, that they have every year.
[00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:41.260]  Neil Bortz, Clark Howard, and others were here.
[00:41:41.721 --> 00:41:42.661]  I did just want to say that
[00:41:43.357 --> 00:41:51.659]  It's a great honor over the years to be able to co-host some of the shows locally here when it comes to town and to be a guest on George's show over 500 plus affiliates and XM radio.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:59.602]  And it was even more fun to be live at Talkfest for an hour with George and your own morning host and program director here, Mark Caesar.
[00:41:59.622 --> 00:42:00.682]  What a professional job.
[00:42:00.742 --> 00:42:03.383]  I mean, big stations always do a good job, but a perfect job.
[00:42:03.823 --> 00:42:04.484]  at TalkFest.
[00:42:04.524 --> 00:42:07.525]  So great to see thousands of you out there and it was wonderful.
[00:42:07.686 --> 00:42:09.166]  I want to see you come out tonight.
[00:42:09.186 --> 00:42:17.572]  I'm going to be at Book People, the biggest independent, well it's the biggest period, but it is independent, bookstore in Texas at the corner of Lamar and 6th Street.
[00:42:17.812 --> 00:42:19.013]  I'll be there from 8 to 10 p.m.
[00:42:19.053 --> 00:42:21.294]  signing copies of my new film, Terror Storm.
[00:42:21.334 --> 00:42:22.835]  If you already have it, you can bring it and I'll sign it.
[00:42:22.855 --> 00:42:31.621]  I'm going to give an hour-long speech from 8 to 9 and then sign autographs and talk to everybody and take questions from 9 to 10 tonight at Book People in downtown Austin.
[00:42:31.661 --> 00:42:32.241]  Take the family
[00:42:32.481 --> 00:42:41.207]  Go eat dinner there at Whole Foods, the biggest independent grocery store in the country, the mothership, the national headquarters of Whole Foods, now in the US and Canada.
[00:42:41.788 --> 00:42:46.131]  And a great place to eat, a bunch of restaurants there, and you can come on over 8 to 10 p.m.
[00:42:46.811 --> 00:42:50.094]  right there, central, at the Book People.
[00:42:50.654 --> 00:42:52.675]  Great bookstore and video store as well.
[00:42:53.016 --> 00:42:57.459]  Let's go back to Stella Costello, and I've got some callers from here in Austin that want to talk about the toll road, like Alex in Austin.
[00:42:58.239 --> 00:43:07.781]  Please continue with your analogy, or your parallel, with if Kodak was being criticized by a bunch of newspapers and then Kodak went and bought them.
[00:43:08.401 --> 00:43:09.261]  That is unbelievable.
[00:43:09.781 --> 00:43:16.603]  Yeah, I mean it shows how dirty these special interests they play.
[00:43:18.143 --> 00:43:23.664]  The folks that really pay for this in the long run, it's us.
[00:43:23.764 --> 00:43:26.905]  Because what they're doing is they're after our land,
[00:43:27.729 --> 00:43:30.730]  They're after our roads, and they're after our water.
[00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:39.891]  They have these special interest groups, they have these corporations, and then special interest groups, and the corporations give money to the elected representatives.
[00:43:40.212 --> 00:43:53.454]  They're supposed to represent us, and then therefore they kind of ditch us because we don't have loads of money to give them for their next election to become mayor or governor or president, because they all think they can become president for some weird reason.
[00:43:54.014 --> 00:43:57.215]  And you have this circle of corruption.
[00:43:58.392 --> 00:44:06.118]  And that's the thing, there's always been boss hog cronyism and good ol' boy networks, but now, I mean, look at some of these headlines here.
[00:44:06.258 --> 00:44:16.686]  I have the Houston Chronicle, came out January 6th, road killer, state's game, highway extortion, Harris County is getting held up on toll road funding.
[00:44:17.448 --> 00:44:23.735]  Here is another story out of The Statesman with the headline, Extortion.
[00:44:24.556 --> 00:44:38.871]  I mean, when you've got foreign companies openly coming in and buying off both parties, when 97% and there are several other polls that show 99% don't want these international toll roads and existing roads, and they just do it, and then they got the nerve when the people start fighting them and beating them.
[00:44:39.477 --> 00:44:55.385]  Thousands showing up at all these big meetings, hundreds at all the small meetings, lawsuits flying, people inside the Texas Department of Transportation going public and releasing documents that the state roads are all paid for, they have extra money, a surplus, but they claim, oh, we need money, these foreigners got to basically be given it.
[00:44:55.846 --> 00:45:00.588]  Just like, again, giving somebody a lottery that makes $700 million a year in Michigan, a foreign company, for a billion.
[00:45:00.608 --> 00:45:04.410]  I mean, would you sell a company that made $700 million profit a year for a billion?
[00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:05.251]  No, that's insane.
[00:45:05.311 --> 00:45:07.692]  It'd be $50 billion, you know, if it made a billion a year.
[00:45:08.292 --> 00:45:12.733]  This is what we're talking about here, and this is just off the charts.
[00:45:12.773 --> 00:45:13.494]  Please continue.
[00:45:13.654 --> 00:45:21.876]  Yeah, and the only reason some of the, you know, the major press, that they're finally doing stories about the extortion and the corruption, is because they're being forced to.
[00:45:21.896 --> 00:45:27.678]  You know, a few years ago, we started our organization, and we started winning many of these battles.
[00:45:28.538 --> 00:45:30.899]  Because we're just doing the right thing.
[00:45:30.959 --> 00:45:31.520]  That's what it's about.
[00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.441]  It's about winning and defeating the New World Order.
[00:45:33.501 --> 00:45:38.283]  This is the funding mechanism for globalization and the North American Union to destroy the U.S.
[00:45:38.303 --> 00:45:39.063]  and we're going to defeat it.
[00:45:39.384 --> 00:45:47.648]  And because we've been winning all these battles for the past three years, the major media is now forced to report on some of these things.
[00:45:47.668 --> 00:45:52.410]  They still put a little bit of their spin on it, but at least they're forced to talk about this.
[00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:53.531]  And here's the beautiful part.
[00:45:54.795 --> 00:46:14.100]  You know, a lot of these politicians, you know, are no good, but there are a few, a very handful of few, and some of these, we have senators now and state representatives that are being very vocal and basically saying TxDOT is extorting the public, they're basically, you know, trying to, they're using our citizens, they're harvesting
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:15.801]  There's a whole land grab component.
[00:46:15.821 --> 00:46:16.342]  Tell folks about that.
[00:46:16.362 --> 00:46:18.403]  We're talking about over a half million acres of Texas land.
[00:46:33.243 --> 00:46:33.443]  We're
[00:46:53.689 --> 00:47:00.277]  They are going to, the government will take, with eminent domain, take this land, over half a million acres.
[00:47:00.417 --> 00:47:11.652]  And again that couples with the new London Kelo decision where they said if private interests want to lobby cities, counties, states and the feds, they're allowed, this legalized bribery, remember the Supreme Court ruling over a year ago folks?
[00:47:12.332 --> 00:47:13.573]  And it's happening in Freeport, Texas.
[00:47:13.593 --> 00:47:14.453]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:47:14.753 --> 00:47:16.954]  Private interests can come lobby to take your land.
[00:47:16.974 --> 00:47:19.395]  And the big secret is, you don't even get just compensation.
[00:47:19.655 --> 00:47:23.056]  In New London, $350,000 tax-appraised houses are being given $60,000 for condemned lot value.
[00:47:26.877 --> 00:47:27.217]  That's right.
[00:47:27.237 --> 00:47:38.988]  And what they have in the law now in Texas, so that you don't get what you deserve, is they have this quick take and they rush the process within three months.
[00:47:39.008 --> 00:47:40.389]  And you've got to take what they say.
[00:47:40.429 --> 00:47:41.350]  Now let's be clear.
[00:47:41.490 --> 00:47:41.951]  Let's be clear.
[00:47:41.971 --> 00:47:44.413]  They're buying up the newspapers so we can't block them.
[00:47:44.773 --> 00:47:46.455]  Can't even write editorials and letters to the editor.
[00:47:47.316 --> 00:47:50.960]  All on the key routes where the toll roads are going to go in on existing roads and new roads.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.546]  They are lobbying and paying off the politicians openly and publicly and have the Supreme Court basically legalize it.
[00:47:57.266 --> 00:48:04.914]  I mean, this is, and they're going to tax it and use it, the SPP.gov, government website, to fund international toll road construction.
[00:48:05.999 --> 00:48:06.759]  On NAFTA Highway.
[00:48:07.019 --> 00:48:17.422]  Yes, and don't forget, the editors and writers of these dozens of papers were writing articles exposing the absurdness of this Trans-Texas Corridor and the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:48:17.442 --> 00:48:22.884]  There have been hundreds of meetings where government officials are getting up saying there's going to be a shooting war!
[00:48:23.184 --> 00:48:24.804]  The newspapers are talking the truth!
[00:48:25.064 --> 00:48:25.885]  They're panicking!
[00:48:26.145 --> 00:48:26.565]  That's right.
[00:48:26.585 --> 00:48:33.967]  So now, these editors and writers of these dozens of newspapers, they're going to be paid by the same folks
[00:48:35.152 --> 00:48:36.934]  First thing they'll do is put new editors in.
[00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:41.198]  Or that old editors will buckle under because they want to keep their job.
[00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:41.799]  Now let's be clear.
[00:48:41.819 --> 00:48:46.724]  They spend $80 million to buy up these Texas and Oklahoma papers and others around the country with key toll road areas.
[00:48:46.824 --> 00:48:47.845]  All right on the toll roads.
[00:48:48.165 --> 00:48:49.286]  All right in the hot spots.
[00:48:49.667 --> 00:48:51.549]  They do this in this huge buyout.
[00:48:52.385 --> 00:48:56.330]  And they think that they're going to be able to get away with this.
[00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:59.915]  I mean, this is just, this ought to just have everybody pulling their hair out.
[00:49:00.255 --> 00:49:00.856]  Absolutely.
[00:49:01.396 --> 00:49:10.688]  I've actually sent this story to all, hundreds of newspapers via email this weekend so that they can, you know,
[00:49:11.368 --> 00:49:12.649]  Get a grasp of what's happening.
[00:49:12.669 --> 00:49:13.789]  Maybe somebody will write about it.
[00:49:14.169 --> 00:49:18.571]  But I'm so happy that you called me today and said you wanted to talk about this because it's a very important issue.
[00:49:18.851 --> 00:49:19.111]  It is.
[00:49:19.131 --> 00:49:19.811]  And give folks the website.
[00:49:19.832 --> 00:49:22.693]  We're going to take one call before we end this hour and come back and continue to talk with you, sir.
[00:49:22.713 --> 00:49:30.576]  Yes, our website is texastollparty.com and you can look for news or a blog and that's a link to my blog where I have a number of different stories.
[00:49:31.267 --> 00:49:38.831]  And I forget the web address, because I've interviewed him many times, for David Stahl and the city managers down in Houston, who's fighting this former police officer, great American conservative patriot.
[00:49:39.672 --> 00:49:42.593]  What is the Corridor Watch website?
[00:49:42.613 --> 00:49:43.474]  CorridorWatch.org?
[00:49:43.634 --> 00:49:46.035]  It is CorridorWatch.org, correct.
[00:49:46.255 --> 00:49:50.257]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Alex, listening in Austin.
[00:49:50.357 --> 00:49:53.499]  He wants to talk about him buying out the newspapers, and how this ties into other issues.
[00:49:53.879 --> 00:49:55.980]  Alex, you're on the air worldwide.
[00:49:57.201 --> 00:49:58.802]  Hi Alex, this is Alex in Austin.
[00:49:58.862 --> 00:49:59.122]  Hello.
[00:49:59.969 --> 00:50:00.089]  Hi.
[00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:21.345]  The reason I was calling is, when I heard about this, it actually tied into something that occurred to me last night, which is, there's another Patriot radio network, I'm not going to mention the name, but just like Radio Free Austin and some of these micro-FM stations carry your broadcasts during the morning, there are some that carry broadcasts from another network, similar to GCN, in the evening.
[00:50:23.447 --> 00:50:24.488]  Sir, we lost you there.
[00:50:24.548 --> 00:50:25.869]  I appreciate your phone call.
[00:50:26.816 --> 00:50:28.378]  I lost some of what he said there.
[00:50:28.398 --> 00:50:40.068]  Uh, Michelle, uh, getting back to the highways, uh, again, people all over the country, this isn't just Texas, I want people to understand it, but we're the frontline battlefield.
[00:50:40.129 --> 00:50:40.849]  Why is that?
[00:50:40.889 --> 00:50:42.210]  How does it tie into the Napta Highway?
[00:50:42.451 --> 00:50:50.918]  Well, Texas, um, the plan is to have this network, and literally it's a grid over Texas, um, and it begins here because, uh,
[00:50:51.932 --> 00:50:52.212]  All right.
[00:51:08.528 --> 00:51:14.191]  That is why here in Central Texas, in Austin, they're looking to toll our freeways.
[00:51:14.351 --> 00:51:21.755]  We're not against regular toll roads where they're traditional, refinanced, but when they start tolling roads already paid for, you cross the line.
[00:51:21.936 --> 00:51:28.059]  But that was illegal until last year, but Bush signed an executive order, but the courts are saying, hey, your executive order doesn't override federal law.
[00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:35.263]  Well, here in Texas, it was illegal to toll publicly financed roads until the special interests changed the laws.
[00:51:36.044 --> 00:51:39.510]  No, they're changing the federal and the state laws.
[00:51:39.570 --> 00:51:41.934]  Look at how this is organized, all before they make their move.
[00:51:42.194 --> 00:51:43.677]  Hundreds of billions every few years on this.
[00:51:43.697 --> 00:51:45.480]  We'll be right back with Sal Costello, second hour.
[00:51:50.894 --> 00:51:51.814]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:51:51.854 --> 00:51:58.997]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:51:59.257 --> 00:52:02.138]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[00:52:02.338 --> 00:52:08.000]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[00:52:08.241 --> 00:52:10.761]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[00:52:12.702 --> 00:52:17.144]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[00:52:22.345 --> 00:52:23.346]  Looking for profits?
[00:52:23.426 --> 00:52:24.806]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:52:25.267 --> 00:52:28.348]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:52:28.388 --> 00:52:35.952]  This low-mintage collector coin, with a total series mintage under $600,000, has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:36.032 --> 00:52:39.374]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:52:39.774 --> 00:52:41.275]  Secure your position today.
[00:52:41.595 --> 00:52:42.836]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:42.856 --> 00:52:43.116]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:52:52.042 --> 00:52:57.783]  Prepare yourself for a talk radio interview.
[00:52:58.043 --> 00:53:01.884]  Scrap yourselves in and hold on.
[00:53:02.904 --> 00:53:04.244]  He stands for truth.
[00:53:05.685 --> 00:53:07.525]  He stands for justice.
[00:53:08.865 --> 00:53:10.446]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:10.826 --> 00:53:13.666]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:14.627 --> 00:53:16.427]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:17.671]  At 877-590-5525.
[00:53:17.731 --> 00:53:21.175]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:30.441 --> 00:53:35.004]  I want to thank all the new affiliates and our existing affiliates for picking up the broadcast.
[00:53:35.244 --> 00:53:38.707]  New syndicated show, the Remus Communications, started three months ago.
[00:53:38.747 --> 00:53:42.049]  Also do a syndicated weekday program from 11 to 2.
[00:53:42.649 --> 00:53:44.411]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:53:44.431 --> 00:53:49.194]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:53:50.436 --> 00:53:55.640]  We have global, international corporations getting together trying to set up a world government.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:55.981]  Why?
[00:53:56.001 --> 00:54:06.990]  The new world government is lobbied and financed and controlled and its bylaws, its entire system has been written up by these multinational corporations.
[00:54:07.010 --> 00:54:10.913]  46 of the world's 100 biggest economies are not nations, are not countries.
[00:54:11.434 --> 00:54:12.535]  They are corporations.
[00:54:12.555 --> 00:54:13.976]  These corporations act like governments.
[00:54:14.276 --> 00:54:16.538]  They have their own mercenaries, their own intelligence bodies.
[00:54:17.350 --> 00:54:37.085]  And this big Spanish-slash-Australian-owned company has come in to buy hundreds of these papers, all in Texas, Oklahoma, and other key areas, right where the toll road fights are happening, where the politicians have been lobbied and been given campaign contributions, they have a word for that, to basically sign the roads over for pennies on the dollar to throw just incredibly expensive toll roads on them.
[00:54:37.105 --> 00:54:40.468]  In fact, even the statesman in an establishment paper admits it will cost over $160.
[00:54:42.461 --> 00:54:49.281]  When they put the toll roads on I-35 to drive to Fort Worth or Dallas and back to Austin.
[00:54:50.575 --> 00:54:53.917]  They're doing it in Europe, they're doing it in Germany, they're doing it in Canada, they're doing it in Australia.
[00:54:54.217 --> 00:54:55.738]  This is part of mass looting.
[00:54:55.778 --> 00:55:03.803]  Shaul Castillo lives in the same area of southwest Austin that I live in, and a few years ago, I guess three or four years ago, he learned they were going to put all these toll roads around where we live.
[00:55:03.823 --> 00:55:06.764]  I couldn't go a mile without getting on a toll road on existing roads.
[00:55:07.065 --> 00:55:08.005]  He's been fighting them.
[00:55:08.385 --> 00:55:09.426]  He's been having victories.
[00:55:09.746 --> 00:55:14.769]  Shaul, continue all the other facets, any other facets we haven't brought up here.
[00:55:15.389 --> 00:55:23.055]  Concerning this, and then we're going to go to the phone calls, and any moves you're planning to make, I know you've had some suits and considered some suits on the state and companies in the past.
[00:55:23.155 --> 00:55:44.692]  I know the legislature in Texas last year, incredibly, had to threaten to sue and had to call for a criminal investigation when the Department of Transportation in Texas, TxDOT, wouldn't tell them about their agreements, their 75-year agreement with Centra, the Spanish-owned company, government-backed, out of Spain saying the government, the state, the elected representatives
[00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:46.073]  Do not have a right.
[00:55:46.353 --> 00:55:50.175]  The elected officials do not even have a right to see what the agreement was.
[00:55:50.215 --> 00:55:51.436]  So break that down for us.
[00:55:51.896 --> 00:55:57.179]  Well, yeah, I mean we filed some suits and we've actually been successful so far.
[00:55:57.879 --> 00:56:07.225]  It's funny because just when you called the attorney, our attorney, we filed another suit against the governor and our local metropolitan planning organization in 2005.
[00:56:09.782 --> 00:56:18.645]  And the darn thing is still slogging along because the governor, you know, sent it to the wrong courts on purpose to slow things down.
[00:56:18.905 --> 00:56:21.565]  And here we are 11 months later from the last hearing.
[00:56:21.585 --> 00:56:24.986]  Well, Rick Perry, that Republican in name only, can run but he can't hide.
[00:56:25.206 --> 00:56:26.047]  Oh yeah.
[00:56:26.167 --> 00:56:31.628]  So our hearing is coming up Wednesday and the attorney just left because we talked about what's happening there.
[00:56:32.068 --> 00:56:38.230]  But yeah, we've, you know, we've been successful because we've pushed on all fronts, political fronts, legal fronts.
[00:56:38.995 --> 00:56:53.109]  We've had a lot of attorneys contribute their time and we've been able to organize well because of our website TexasTollParty.com where people can get connected and stay connected and I have my blog that also I educate people.
[00:56:53.129 --> 00:57:00.195]  I have stories on there every day about what's happening and it's kind of shocking that I'm able to write stories every day about this corruption.
[00:57:00.376 --> 00:57:02.718]  I'm kind of really shocked that
[00:57:03.157 --> 00:57:06.479]  There's something new every day that surfaces that is horrific.
[00:57:06.699 --> 00:57:11.022]  And let's be clear, most of the time they don't even deny it, they don't come sue you, because what you're saying is open record.
[00:57:11.182 --> 00:57:12.063]  Yeah, I've never been sued.
[00:57:12.103 --> 00:57:13.264]  You're the one suing them.
[00:57:13.324 --> 00:57:20.709]  Now, but I want to make this point, because what's emerging, and I want your take on this stuff as fellow founder of the big Texas organization fighting this here on the front lines.
[00:57:20.729 --> 00:57:23.771]  This is a national issue though, coming to an area near you if it isn't already there.
[00:57:24.835 --> 00:57:36.473]  It's the way for over a decade they lobbied, they laid their plans quietly, buying newspapers, getting Bush to sign an executive order, getting governors to ram it through legislatures to let them put toll roads on existing roads.
[00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:42.034]  Then lying for four years saying they wouldn't put roads on existing roads when their own plans were public.
[00:57:42.275 --> 00:57:44.497]  Now they're openly trying to put tolls on existing roads.
[00:57:44.917 --> 00:57:52.684]  I mean this is amazing just the forethought and really the way this is run like a mafia organization.
[00:57:52.704 --> 00:57:56.868]  I mean this is and it's so complex but any little slice
[00:57:57.348 --> 00:57:59.149]  It's so bad it should bring the system down.
[00:57:59.189 --> 00:58:00.510]  It's just everywhere you look.
[00:58:00.590 --> 00:58:00.930]  That's right.
[00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.531]  It's called an orgy of evidence.
[00:58:02.731 --> 00:58:03.732]  Oh, it's true.
[00:58:03.812 --> 00:58:04.172]  It's true.
[00:58:04.492 --> 00:58:09.675]  And you know, I was just looking at this Macri who purchased these newspapers here in Texas.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:14.202]  To squelch the stories they were putting out.
[00:58:14.222 --> 00:58:15.744]  The toll road company buying the newspapers.
[00:58:15.904 --> 00:58:16.344]  That's right.
[00:58:16.885 --> 00:58:23.891]  Macri is partnered with Sintra, and Sintra has a contract to build the first part of the TTC here in Texas.
[00:58:23.931 --> 00:58:27.234]  And we wondered why a year ago they made a partnership and now we see.
[00:58:27.434 --> 00:58:27.834]  That's right.
[00:58:27.934 --> 00:58:37.943]  And also I want to mention this, that they're not only just taking our land, taking our freeways, but they're also buying up our toll roads.
[00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:48.882]  Here in Indiana, Accenture and Macquarie, together as partners, they were part of a
[00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:55.132]  Billion-dollar deal in Indiana buying existing toll roads.
[00:58:55.212 --> 00:58:59.114]  They want to control the freeways, the tollways, they want to control all of it.
[00:58:59.194 --> 00:59:10.580]  And let's be clear, taxpayers pay for the roads, they're built, the tech stock documents are public, and then they're basically just given it to manage it and keep most of the profits, and then part of it goes into the SPP, the federal program to build roads in Mexico.
[00:59:10.801 --> 00:59:12.481]  Our money to build roads in Mexico.
[00:59:13.002 --> 00:59:13.182]  Yes.
[00:59:14.696 --> 00:59:14.856]  Yes.
[00:59:15.036 --> 00:59:16.017]  That's Lou Dobbs, folks.
[00:59:16.037 --> 00:59:16.477]  That's not us.
[00:59:16.497 --> 00:59:18.278]  We reported him, of course, two years before Lou Dobbs.
[00:59:18.298 --> 00:59:20.060]  Lou Dobbs has been doing fantastic work.
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:20.740]  Oh my gosh.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:22.761]  He gets on there and says, New World Order, take over.
[00:59:22.801 --> 00:59:23.762]  I mean, he's just incredible.
[00:59:23.922 --> 00:59:24.583]  Yes, he's great.
[00:59:25.143 --> 00:59:25.843]  Well, continue.
[00:59:25.883 --> 00:59:27.665]  Please continue.
[00:59:27.805 --> 00:59:31.347]  Well, you know, there's so much to talk about.
[00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:33.328]  I mean, do you want to talk about a specific thing?
[00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:40.433]  Well, I think it's important just to look at how much money they paid, how many politicians they bought.
[00:59:41.253 --> 00:59:42.334]  Yeah, I mean, it's basically...
[00:59:44.412 --> 00:59:45.052]  Most of them.
[00:59:45.392 --> 00:59:46.252]  I mean, most of them.
[00:59:46.612 --> 00:59:48.533]  On a local level, on a regional level.
[00:59:48.733 --> 00:59:49.573]  And that's both parties.
[00:59:49.833 --> 00:59:58.915]  Here, locally, we've got Senator Kirk Watson, who just took office, and who just got on Campo for the first time on Monday night.
[00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:04.696]  And he steps into Campo, he becomes chair immediately because he's been working behind the scenes.
[01:00:04.816 --> 01:00:05.736]  He says, I'm chair, right?
[01:00:05.756 --> 01:00:06.737]  Everybody goes, yeah, you're chair.
[01:00:06.777 --> 01:00:07.397]  Yeah, you're chair.
[01:00:07.457 --> 01:00:10.437]  And then he shelves phase two so they can vote in secret session.
[01:00:10.557 --> 01:00:12.218]  Yes, his key was...
[01:00:15.582 --> 01:00:17.983]  His thing was... Hold on, I've got to switch phones.
[01:00:18.003 --> 01:00:18.223]  Sorry.
[01:00:19.664 --> 01:00:22.626]  He's there babysitting the children and doing the radio show.
[01:00:22.667 --> 01:00:25.288]  Yeah, and I've got the lawyer coming back because he left something here.
[01:00:25.428 --> 01:00:26.529]  So, yes.
[01:00:27.450 --> 01:00:29.812]  Yeah, they were having a lawyer meeting right before we got him on.
[01:00:29.832 --> 01:00:32.594]  He would have been on at four, but the lawyer... This is how we're fighting, folks.
[01:00:33.114 --> 01:00:33.894]  Fighting in the trenches.
[01:00:33.974 --> 01:00:34.735]  It's okay, Sal.
[01:00:35.115 --> 01:00:35.676]  Yes.
[01:00:36.756 --> 01:00:37.017]  Okay.
[01:00:38.037 --> 01:00:38.398]  I'm back.
[01:00:38.438 --> 01:00:38.678]  Sorry.
[01:00:38.738 --> 01:00:39.318]  Okay, it's fine.
[01:00:39.518 --> 01:00:39.779]  Okay.
[01:00:40.019 --> 01:00:41.660]  So, what was I talking about?
[01:00:42.205 --> 01:00:44.027]  We were getting into how they've bought the politicians.
[01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:53.736]  Oh yeah, so the Kirk Watson, he steps into Campo and his plan was to become the hero, although we know his deal, because he does all these backdoor deals.
[01:00:54.437 --> 01:01:00.002]  Well let's go back, they said there was going to be a 15,000 acre park in southwest Travis County 10 years ago.
[01:01:00.582 --> 01:01:01.422]  Uh, eight years ago.
[01:01:01.442 --> 01:01:04.844]  Uh, Save Our Springs got all the phony environmentalists sucked into it.
[01:01:04.864 --> 01:01:05.904]  They claimed to be a huge park.
[01:01:06.124 --> 01:01:08.165]  They forced everybody to sell for pennies on the dollar.
[01:01:08.565 --> 01:01:09.566]  Uh, banned them from building.
[01:01:09.586 --> 01:01:11.887]  And then after they got it three years later, everybody forgot.
[01:01:12.067 --> 01:01:15.508]  And they're building huge luxury homes and condos and golf courses.
[01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:19.191]  And they ripped off the landowners, and this guy is just unbelievable.
[01:01:19.211 --> 01:01:19.851]  Oh, he's horrible.
[01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:27.077]  Now listen, when he was mayor of Austin in 2000, and by the way, this doesn't mean, you know, I'm talking about this as an example, but this happens throughout the whole country.
[01:01:27.097 --> 01:01:29.098]  Well, I've been in screaming matches six inches from him.
[01:01:29.138 --> 01:01:36.864]  This happens all over the country, folks, and if you do... He also wanted to ban guns in Austin like they have in D.C.
[01:01:37.144 --> 01:01:40.987]  If you do a Freedom of Information Act on your local government officials, and you just check on what they've
[01:01:41.548 --> 01:01:44.489]  What they've supported in the past and where the money is and where it went.
[01:01:44.629 --> 01:01:45.609]  This is his specialty.
[01:01:45.629 --> 01:01:47.029]  He's a real estate land grabber.
[01:01:47.249 --> 01:01:50.990]  And of course the real estate associations are supporting him because they've all got the good old boy deals.
[01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:57.391]  And he had to recuse himself in the meeting after they took all the votes, which isn't really recusing because he owns a bunch of land on a toll road.
[01:01:57.671 --> 01:01:58.532]  Yes, exactly right.
[01:01:58.612 --> 01:02:01.192]  And this guy, here's a perfect example.
[01:02:01.212 --> 01:02:08.854]  We've got documents that prove that a City of Austin bond election that he pushed when he was City of Austin Mayor in the year 2000
[01:02:10.086 --> 01:02:15.031]  Um, in that bond proposal language, toll road is not in it.
[01:02:15.791 --> 01:02:22.017]  Um, and these were promised for freeways because of our horrible congestion and we need to, we need the... Stay there!
[01:02:22.057 --> 01:02:23.678]  I want to hear about this on the other side.
[01:02:23.718 --> 01:02:25.300]  Sal Castello, final segment with him.
[01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:28.022]  We're also going to go to your calls.

[01:03:54.116 --> 01:03:58.819]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:03.683]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:04:03.883 --> 01:04:06.625]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:04:06.665 --> 01:04:07.786]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:04:09.127 --> 01:04:13.730]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:21.836]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:04:22.896 --> 01:04:25.958]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[01:04:26.859 --> 01:04:31.562]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:04:32.543 --> 01:04:33.844]  Call for your copy today.

[01:04:37.326 --> 01:04:43.170]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:04:43.870 --> 01:04:44.011]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:04:44.051 --> 01:04:44.251]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:04:52.216 --> 01:05:00.944]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.324 --> 01:05:08.931]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:09.648 --> 01:05:16.692]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.092 --> 01:05:19.994]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:20.414 --> 01:05:22.735]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:23.156 --> 01:05:24.016]  NSA spies.
[01:05:24.477 --> 01:05:28.518]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:28.818 --> 01:05:32.299]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:32.779 --> 01:05:34.720]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:38.961]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:03.356 --> 01:07:04.596]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:04.676 --> 01:07:06.596]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:07.337 --> 01:07:10.738]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:10.998 --> 01:07:13.798]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.039 --> 01:07:16.839]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:07:16.899 --> 01:07:17.560]  Here's Sunday.
[01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.320]  It's 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:18.780]  Central.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.920]  5 to 7 p.m.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:20.480]  Eastern.
[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.741]  Guess that'd be 3 to 5 miles.
[01:07:25.558 --> 01:07:26.938]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:07:26.978 --> 01:07:32.540]  Coming up, I'm going to get into the phony peace movement, how they make, a lot of them make the anti-war movement look stupid.
[01:07:33.361 --> 01:07:36.402]  We'll also get into the internet, revolutionize TV in the next five years.
[01:07:37.662 --> 01:07:40.143]  We've got Scooter Libby blowing the whistle more and more on Cheney.
[01:07:40.183 --> 01:07:40.963]  Will he sink?
[01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:43.864]  Doesn't matter, he's a New World Order puppet to begin with, just like Hillary.
[01:07:44.244 --> 01:07:46.165]  What a nightmare, twisting Hillary and
[01:07:47.563 --> 01:07:49.284]  Who knows, coming up in 2008.
[01:07:49.645 --> 01:07:57.930]  Going back to Sel Castello, the founder of the Texas Toll Party, Austin Toll Party, on the front lines fighting this, one of the biggest experts, I think the expert on the subject.
[01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:07.137]  Continuing with the story about former Austin mayor, state senator, now the head of the CAMPO board, this unelected groups that are out there doing this.
[01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:11.380]  Go over again the bond proposal for us.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.243]  Yes, and quickly again, this is a snapshot of what's happening throughout the country.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:25.248]  This former mayor, when he was mayor in the year 2000, promised everybody, he said, look, he went out and sold Prop 1 bonds because of our traffic congestion.
[01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:29.191]  He said, we need new roads, you need to vote for this, this money will go for our roads.
[01:08:29.611 --> 01:08:30.712]  It was his mantra.
[01:08:30.772 --> 01:08:42.241]  So, here we are, seven years later, and I've got a document that proves that $67 million were diverted from those Prop 1 bonds that were promised for free roads,
[01:08:42.661 --> 01:08:46.262]  Into phase one toll roads that just opened up weeks ago.
[01:08:46.282 --> 01:08:48.243]  67 million dollars.
[01:08:48.303 --> 01:08:49.684]  And here's this guy... So let's be clear.
[01:08:49.784 --> 01:08:57.847]  Again, not only is the state paying for it, and we're paying for it, now city money for quote freeways, and that was in the proposal, and of course I was against it at the time.
[01:08:57.887 --> 01:08:58.707]  They've got plenty of money.
[01:08:58.927 --> 01:09:02.909]  TxDOT documents show they've got a huge surplus, but now that goes to them.
[01:09:02.929 --> 01:09:03.849]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:09.231]  They actually divert the money from city, county, state, everywhere you look they're diverting money.
[01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:13.492]  For example, TxDOT claims that it has no more money, so we have to toll everything.
[01:09:13.552 --> 01:09:17.993]  But their own document released two years ago, right before Christmas, their own employees say they've got a huge surplus.
[01:09:18.093 --> 01:09:18.994]  But no, it's not just that.
[01:09:19.074 --> 01:09:23.475]  I did a Freedom of Information Act request, and I got all their bank accounts.
[01:09:23.615 --> 01:09:26.656]  They're sitting on billions of dollars, but they say... Six billion.
[01:09:27.336 --> 01:09:27.876]  Billions.
[01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:33.838]  And they say that those dollars don't count because those are for toll roads.
[01:09:33.938 --> 01:09:38.139]  But the money they collected from us for gas tax was for freeways.
[01:09:39.102 --> 01:09:44.807]  Now let's make clear, let's make clear, the foreign companies buy off the politicians publicly, the majority of both parties.
[01:09:44.827 --> 01:09:48.170]  This is a huge, this is some of the biggest lobbying going on in the country.
[01:09:48.530 --> 01:09:50.952]  And the same thing is happening in your area, folks, we've studied it.
[01:09:50.992 --> 01:10:00.080]  We've looked at it all over the nation, from Indiana to Virginia to New York to New Jersey to Washington State to Oregon to California to Illinois, I mean Florida, it's everywhere.
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.502]  Okay, but Texas is the worst, the front line.
[01:10:02.803 --> 01:10:09.380]  We pay for it, they got surplus, and these people literally for chicken feed, given to politicians, are handed the roads.
[01:10:09.961 --> 01:10:10.122]  Yeah.
[01:10:11.101 --> 01:10:11.801]  It's absurd.
[01:10:11.941 --> 01:10:14.642]  Let's talk about solutions, and I know I have it all over the map here.
[01:10:14.662 --> 01:10:16.623]  Any other key points you think listeners should be aware of?
[01:10:16.863 --> 01:10:25.585]  Well, the solutions we've been focused on are, number one, the thieves must be de-elected, and we were successful last year.
[01:10:25.645 --> 01:10:26.566]  What about grand juries?
[01:10:26.586 --> 01:10:31.567]  We've got a lot of the statesmen now talking about indictments, saying this looks like it's criminal.
[01:10:32.167 --> 01:10:33.247]  What about racketeering?
[01:10:34.068 --> 01:10:35.228]  I mean, there's so many things.
[01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:38.449]  We need state grand juries or federal grand juries to start investigations?
[01:10:39.173 --> 01:10:39.433]  Sure.
[01:10:39.953 --> 01:10:40.534]  Absolutely.
[01:10:41.314 --> 01:10:42.054]  I'm all for that.
[01:10:42.995 --> 01:10:48.137]  The key is for them to have enough evidence and enough willpower to move forward.
[01:10:48.597 --> 01:10:49.018]  That's right.
[01:10:50.578 --> 01:10:51.419]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:51.519 --> 01:10:53.399]  Well, please continue with the solutions.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:56.641]  Well, the number one solution is to remove the looters.
[01:10:56.661 --> 01:11:00.923]  Last year we were successful with investing dollars in the two races.
[01:11:00.963 --> 01:11:04.024]  We got two of those corrupt politicians out of office.
[01:11:04.424 --> 01:11:05.505]  And that's just the beginning.
[01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:15.012]  And then other politicians sort of see that they can be removed, and that they have this fear, and then some of them will come around and do the right thing, but we continue on that path.
[01:11:15.233 --> 01:11:19.816]  Or they do what McCracken does and claims he's pro-toll, then he comes over to our side and flips back.
[01:11:20.297 --> 01:11:25.581]  Well, McCracken, he can claim all he wants, but he voted twice to toll roads what he paid for.
[01:11:25.601 --> 01:11:28.123]  And that's a sniveling city council member here in Austin.
[01:11:28.303 --> 01:11:29.644]  Yeah, he's a real prize.
[01:11:29.684 --> 01:11:34.648]  He lied to me personally for seven months and promised us an independent investigation.
[01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:40.892]  Well, he lied in the newspaper and I told you in my studio, I said he's gonna stab you in the back and you said, well, let's see.
[01:11:41.072 --> 01:11:42.994]  Well, I wanted to let him stab me in the back.
[01:11:43.354 --> 01:11:52.579]  Because now he's on our, if you go to AustinTollParty.com, we have a cartoon with him in it, showing him as one of those corrupt fools taking money and voting.
[01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:55.700]  Well he's not a fool, he's going to move up the chain of power.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.101]  It's going to be a little harder for him, I'll tell you that.
[01:11:58.121 --> 01:12:03.224]  He is looking to be mayor next year, but we've got some plans being hatched.
[01:12:04.269 --> 01:12:07.171]  Well, again, 97% in major Texas polls.
[01:12:07.511 --> 01:12:16.676]  I want all these politicians to know, and all the listeners and everybody else, we're the majority, we've got the Constitution, we've got decency, we've got God on our side, and we're going to defeat this thing.
[01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:26.401]  And you know, the only way to win is to organize, and that's where our website texastollparty.com has been so helpful, because it has helped us build our organization so that we can
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.786]  Communicate with people in a cheap and efficient way with email and keep people up to date with the shenanigans that go on.
[01:12:33.806 --> 01:12:34.947]  And then they get more educated.
[01:12:34.967 --> 01:12:36.828]  They talk with their family and friends and neighbors.
[01:12:36.848 --> 01:12:42.933]  And by the way, there are other groups forming from Kansas to New York to fight the land grab toll roads as well.
[01:12:43.073 --> 01:12:44.835]  Yes, and more groups the merrier.
[01:12:45.455 --> 01:12:48.718]  But it's important that each group organizes and collects.
[01:12:49.178 --> 01:12:50.059]  It actually
[01:12:50.669 --> 01:12:51.570]  Grow their group.
[01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:55.913]  You know, just having a half dozen people or a hundred people or two hundred or a couple thousand.
[01:12:55.953 --> 01:12:58.875]  How many people have signed petitions and been involved with just your group?
[01:12:59.135 --> 01:13:01.857]  We have tens of thousands of people in our database.
[01:13:02.297 --> 01:13:07.021]  And by the way, there have been meetings where there are eleven hundred people at these TxDOT and CAMPO board meetings.
[01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:09.301]  And literally they'll say, who's for the toll roads?
[01:13:09.381 --> 01:13:14.602]  And five, six people will, we've got video of this, will raise their hands and thousands will say no.
[01:13:14.643 --> 01:13:18.263]  That's why they just had this Campo toll road phase two meeting.
[01:13:18.523 --> 01:13:21.984]  And so notice that he did what he did when he was mayor.
[01:13:22.304 --> 01:13:29.386]  The now state senator just simply tabled it so they can later vote on it in executive session.
[01:13:29.626 --> 01:13:31.286]  So everybody's hearing that we beat phase two.
[01:13:31.366 --> 01:13:36.327]  No, the submarine just dove to reemerge later and fired torpedoes at our freeways.
[01:13:36.860 --> 01:13:39.361]  That's right, and the beautiful part is we're ahead of the curve now.
[01:13:39.401 --> 01:13:42.143]  Before, we weren't organized locally.
[01:13:42.543 --> 01:13:45.424]  Before, we didn't know what they were doing, where they were coming from.
[01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:47.185]  We know their whole game plan now.
[01:13:47.245 --> 01:13:48.906]  Well, Kirk Watson's a carpetbagger.
[01:13:48.926 --> 01:13:50.567]  He literally moved here and became mayor.
[01:13:50.587 --> 01:13:51.928]  He needs to leave.
[01:13:52.008 --> 01:13:53.168]  Yeah, he's a real clown.
[01:13:53.348 --> 01:13:55.409]  He's one of those dangerous politicians, too.
[01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:57.330]  He's super smooth.
[01:13:57.731 --> 01:13:58.831]  He'll smile at you.
[01:13:58.891 --> 01:13:59.512]  He'll lie to you.
[01:13:59.532 --> 01:14:01.172]  You won't have any idea he's lying to you.
[01:14:01.553 --> 01:14:04.294]  He's one of those very dangerous politicians, like Brewster McCracken.
[01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.015]  Well, he's more powerful than Brewster McCracken.
[01:14:07.035 --> 01:14:12.178]  And Brewster McCracken's a ringwraith than Kirk Watson is Sauron.
[01:14:12.298 --> 01:14:16.461]  Brewster is Kirk Watson ten years ago.
[01:14:17.961 --> 01:14:29.865]  I know, and they just sit there and smile at us and glad hand people and just schlep that good old boy friendly, you know, but I mean it's like Eddie Haskell on steroids.
[01:14:29.945 --> 01:14:31.906]  I mean, you know, Eddie Haskell is not a nice fellow.
[01:14:32.006 --> 01:14:38.568]  Well just like Brewster, you know, he went out to the press and he was going to be our hero and he said, hey, I'm going to have an independent investigative report.
[01:14:39.608 --> 01:14:40.649]  That was just to stall you.
[01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:41.690]  Oh no, it was horrible.
[01:14:41.730 --> 01:14:42.410]  And to spy on you.
[01:14:42.610 --> 01:14:49.894]  It was horrible because he ended up allowing the toll authority to hire the contractors to do the independent investigation.
[01:14:49.914 --> 01:15:02.061]  Well that's like Bush hiring his buddies and appointing the 9-11 Commission and calling it independent or Janet Reno as Attorney General appointing two of her deputies and appointing Senator Danforth to run the whitewash investigation on Oklahoma.
[01:15:02.121 --> 01:15:02.381]  That's right.
[01:15:02.401 --> 01:15:03.122]  Excuse me, on Waco.
[01:15:03.342 --> 01:15:03.682]  That's right.
[01:15:03.702 --> 01:15:07.363]  So Kirk Watson's plan was to come in and say no to Phase 2 to stop it.
[01:15:07.483 --> 01:15:11.484]  And then his plan is to bring in Plan B, which is... Renaming it.
[01:15:11.704 --> 01:15:13.924]  He's going to call it Managed Lanes.
[01:15:13.944 --> 01:15:19.185]  He's not going to use the words toll roads, but Managed Lanes... So they're going to start incrementally by grabbing only a few of the lanes.
[01:15:19.365 --> 01:15:19.625]  No, no.
[01:15:19.906 --> 01:15:25.347]  Yeah, but Managed Lanes is a marketing term to replace the nasty word toll road.
[01:15:25.507 --> 01:15:26.087]  Well, it's like...
[01:15:27.162 --> 01:15:30.144]  It's not an increase in troops, it's a build-up.
[01:15:30.624 --> 01:15:32.245]  It's not unpatriotic, it's a Patriot Act!
[01:15:33.225 --> 01:15:35.226]  Shelka Schillow, thank you so much.
[01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:37.987]  You know what, I've got one more question before I have to break.
[01:15:38.027 --> 01:15:46.292]  I want to hear what you're going to do about this foreign company coming in and buying up the newspapers that have been critical of the foreign-owned company seizing our roads.
[01:15:46.692 --> 01:15:51.054]  All this and more, your calls, and we'll expose the phony left anti-war movement on the other side.
[01:15:52.259 --> 01:15:56.327]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:15:56.527 --> 01:15:59.933]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:16:00.114 --> 01:16:03.620]  Here's Dr. Matson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:16:03.832 --> 01:16:07.093]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:16:07.113 --> 01:16:12.576]  This basic tenet of yeast and the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[01:16:12.596 --> 01:16:22.240]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.661]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:16:23.681 --> 01:16:29.143]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:16:29.643 --> 01:16:34.125]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:16:34.165 --> 01:16:35.526]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:16:35.686 --> 01:16:39.568]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:40.448]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:53.013]  It's a fact.
[01:16:53.213 --> 01:16:57.655]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:16:58.095 --> 01:17:03.277]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:06.778]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:17:07.038 --> 01:17:14.140]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:21.707]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:17:22.128 --> 01:17:23.969]  We also do credit restoration.
[01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:30.756]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:17:30.976 --> 01:17:34.720]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:37.662]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[01:17:37.702 --> 01:17:38.542]  to 5 p.m.
[01:17:38.602 --> 01:17:41.824]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:17:42.124 --> 01:17:45.666]  That's 920-293-8024.
[01:17:47.227 --> 01:17:48.288]  And ask for Robert.
[01:17:48.708 --> 01:17:51.750]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:52.851]  Attention!
[01:17:53.091 --> 01:17:54.532]  Attention everyone!
[01:17:54.652 --> 01:17:57.113]  A brand new invention just released.
[01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.854]  It's called Wrist Ease.
[01:17:58.914 --> 01:18:01.876]  The new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[01:18:02.541 --> 01:18:09.345]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[01:18:09.886 --> 01:18:22.754]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[01:18:23.214 --> 01:18:27.197]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[01:18:27.657 --> 01:18:31.620]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.726]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[01:18:38.107 --> 01:18:41.130]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[01:18:41.511 --> 01:18:42.732]  That's Wristease.
[01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:48.118]  W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E Wristease.com.
[01:18:48.278 --> 01:18:50.921]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[01:18:51.818 --> 01:18:57.862]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:18:58.403 --> 01:19:04.287]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:19:04.627 --> 01:19:07.889]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[01:19:08.289 --> 01:19:10.291]  Start reading the Nationalist Times each month.
[01:19:10.531 --> 01:19:15.934]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[01:19:16.235 --> 01:19:17.155]  Published monthly since 1985,
[01:19:18.336 --> 01:19:18.896]  We're good to go.
[01:19:48.676 --> 01:19:53.859]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:19:53.879 --> 01:19:55.039]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:19:55.079 --> 01:19:56.840]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:14.594 --> 01:20:15.956]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:16.277 --> 01:20:17.699]  Three months into syndication.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.467]  I cannot think of the crew here doing a better job of the great affiliates picking us up.
[01:20:22.567 --> 01:20:28.477]  First show syndicated by Emmes Communications in association with my syndicator, the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:29.219 --> 01:20:39.062]  And again, I'm just so thankful to Ted Anderson, to Mark Caesar, to Mr. Sinclair, to the folks that head up MS Communications, to all of them for the great job they're doing.
[01:20:39.102 --> 01:20:41.042]  And it's not just MS Stations carrying the show.
[01:20:41.643 --> 01:20:45.644]  We've got just, I don't know, we're getting like three or four new affiliates a week now.
[01:20:45.704 --> 01:20:46.904]  It's really accelerating.
[01:20:48.004 --> 01:20:49.585]  And I'm just excited to be here with you.
[01:20:49.625 --> 01:20:56.407]  Program note, if you want to come hear me speak for an hour and take questions, and then sign my new film, Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror,
[01:20:57.222 --> 01:20:58.622]  From 8 to 10 p.m.
[01:20:58.662 --> 01:20:59.022]  tonight.
[01:20:59.582 --> 01:21:02.843]  That's coming up in about 2 hours and 26 minutes.
[01:21:03.483 --> 01:21:10.305]  I will give an hour-long speech and then take questions from 9 to 10 o'clock and sign Terror Storms at Book People.
[01:21:10.325 --> 01:21:14.425]  You can also bring any copies you've gotten off of Amazon.com or Infowars.com.
[01:21:14.445 --> 01:21:18.906]  It went to number 8 on Amazon and it stayed in the top 100 off and on the last few months.
[01:21:19.446 --> 01:21:21.987]  And we are really, really excited about Terror Storm.
[01:21:22.722 --> 01:21:23.403]  We're good to go.
[01:21:34.668 --> 01:21:37.550]  And so, if you want the high-quality DVD, you can come get it tonight.
[01:21:38.151 --> 01:21:41.393]  And it's Book People at the corner of 6th and Lamar.
[01:21:41.913 --> 01:21:48.418]  The biggest independent, in its biggest period in Texas, bookstore, but also is independent book people.
[01:21:48.438 --> 01:21:52.501]  There's only one the corner of 6th and Lamar in the old Whole Foods grocery store building.
[01:21:52.521 --> 01:21:53.602]  The new Whole Foods, the biggest
[01:21:54.502 --> 01:22:00.884]  Uh, organic grocery store in the country, and the biggest Whole Foods grocery store, their headquarters, their corporate headquarters is right next door.
[01:22:01.144 --> 01:22:02.564]  You can go over there and eat and hang out with the family.
[01:22:02.584 --> 01:22:05.845]  They got a whole bunch of restaurants, 15 plus, and you can come on over.
[01:22:05.905 --> 01:22:08.106]  So, get in the car, go eat dinner, and I want to see you at 8 o'clock.
[01:22:08.446 --> 01:22:09.846]  Book people, 6th and Lamar.
[01:22:09.866 --> 01:22:12.007]  They got a free parking garage right there.
[01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:14.908]  You can park at or parking around the area at the meters if you'd like.
[01:22:14.948 --> 01:22:15.568]  It's free right now.
[01:22:16.266 --> 01:22:16.627]  I want to see
[01:22:33.069 --> 01:22:39.534]  Well, so many things pop up a week that I quickly have to decide how this is best to be dealt with and I think politically is best dealt with.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:01.265]  And that's why I sort of created a story, and then I got it out to all newspapers throughout all of Texas.
[01:23:01.465 --> 01:23:02.666]  And you've had victory after victory.
[01:23:02.906 --> 01:23:15.597]  Well, yes, and so I'm hoping that the media starts picking this up, and they start going, wait a minute, this is our credibility, so we need to nip this in the bud, because otherwise we're going to have problems.
[01:23:15.617 --> 01:23:20.261]  No, the newspapers don't care, and that's why their circulation is down 60 plus percent in the last 10 years.
[01:23:21.162 --> 01:23:31.365]  And for the pockets of talk radio that allow the truth to be told, those shows get the highest ratings because 97% are against this issue, and 91% in a Gallup poll are against open borders.
[01:23:31.605 --> 01:23:37.087]  You know, all we're doing is what's constitutional, what's common sense, and what the people want and demand.
[01:23:37.267 --> 01:23:40.308]  Yes, yes, and the internet is great too.
[01:23:40.388 --> 01:23:47.950]  So we're looking at all media outlets to take the story and run with it, and hopefully they'll take it and it'll keep this from happening again, or
[01:23:48.789 --> 01:23:51.532]  Maybe put enough pressure that some other things will happen.
[01:23:51.652 --> 01:23:56.737]  Because all of these things we do, they're ripples and we keep having these effects.
[01:23:57.138 --> 01:24:02.063]  And the ripples sometimes have effects that we don't imagine and that are positive for us.
[01:24:02.762 --> 01:24:08.047]  We're just continuing to push forward and we're having great successes and we'll just keep doing so.
[01:24:08.248 --> 01:24:10.470]  And the message is you can fight City Hall.
[01:24:10.810 --> 01:24:12.972]  Sal, thanks for spending time with us on a Sunday night.
[01:24:12.992 --> 01:24:13.953]  Get back to your family.
[01:24:14.053 --> 01:24:14.614]  Thank you, sir.
[01:24:14.754 --> 01:24:15.074]  You bet.
[01:24:15.094 --> 01:24:16.095]  I appreciate your call.
[01:24:16.136 --> 01:24:19.399]  I called him earlier today and his wife's out visiting with in-laws.
[01:24:20.183 --> 01:24:23.005]  And he's taking care of the kids.
[01:24:23.325 --> 01:24:26.007]  He's babysitting and coming on the show.
[01:24:26.027 --> 01:24:26.987]  Or he would have been in studio.
[01:24:27.188 --> 01:24:28.188]  But this just broke.
[01:24:28.608 --> 01:24:29.689]  And it's in foreign papers.
[01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:30.730]  The Australians are real proud.
[01:24:30.770 --> 01:24:31.710]  The Spanish are real proud.
[01:24:31.871 --> 01:24:35.773]  They're buying up our newspapers right along the toll roads so no one can resist them.
[01:24:36.073 --> 01:24:38.054]  But hey, those newspapers are a dead letter.
[01:24:38.415 --> 01:24:40.556]  They'll have circulation in readers when they tell the truth.
[01:24:40.876 --> 01:24:45.039]  As soon as the people get word of this, bye-bye subscriptions!
[01:24:46.174 --> 01:24:51.536]  So that's why they're moving to shut down the web, to tax it, to get rid of net neutrality, because they're shutting down the papers and buying them up.
[01:24:51.896 --> 01:24:57.179]  And on a hundred other big issues, they want to restrict the web and they're trying very, very hard to restrict free speech.
[01:24:57.239 --> 01:24:59.639]  Newt Gingrich, Hillary, they've all been calling for it.
[01:24:59.659 --> 01:25:09.523]  The Democrats are calling, as I spoke last week, for the Fairness Doctrine pre-88, which banned political talk radio with any statements or any opinions or any facts for being on air.
[01:25:09.563 --> 01:25:10.804]  They're now trying that!
[01:25:11.624 --> 01:25:12.505]  To try to shut us down.
[01:25:12.525 --> 01:25:13.565]  It is not going to work.
[01:25:14.025 --> 01:25:16.366]  The people are discovering that you're trying to keep them from the info.
[01:25:16.946 --> 01:25:18.867]  Alternative media is now the biggest.
[01:25:18.927 --> 01:25:24.149]  If you look at the pie chart that big media research firms and think tanks have put out.
[01:25:24.549 --> 01:25:25.950]  Well, don't listen to me.
[01:25:26.110 --> 01:25:27.691]  I've got it right here in front of me.
[01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:28.751]  In fact, let me just get to that now.
[01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.096]  It's here deep in the stack.
[01:25:31.437 --> 01:25:37.883]  YouTube has started sharing revenue with its users over 100 million individual users per week and growing exponentially.
[01:25:38.163 --> 01:25:46.171]  You go to the web rating traffic sites like Alexa.com put out by Amazon with its cookies on the web tracking where you go and it's just exponential.
[01:25:46.551 --> 01:25:52.317]  If it continues to grow at this level they will have 300 million individual visitors a week in one year.
[01:25:53.098 --> 01:25:55.560]  And it is not following the trend of the last year.
[01:25:55.981 --> 01:25:58.303]  It is accelerating out of that trend.
[01:25:58.363 --> 01:25:59.844]  And so are all of my websites.
[01:26:00.805 --> 01:26:04.068]  So this is unbelievable.
[01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:05.409]  This is a godsend.
[01:26:05.690 --> 01:26:09.133]  But is the establishment, is the old line media going to allow itself to be completely destroyed?
[01:26:09.153 --> 01:26:10.254]  They're trying to buy it up.
[01:26:10.274 --> 01:26:11.095]  They're trying to consolidate it.
[01:26:11.115 --> 01:26:11.935]  They're trying to tax it.
[01:26:12.136 --> 01:26:12.976]  They're trying to restrict it.
[01:26:13.016 --> 01:26:14.698]  Big corporations are trying to pass laws.
[01:26:14.978 --> 01:26:25.762]  By lobbying, telecommunications companies spent 150 mil plus the AP reported last year trying to pass a ban of net neutrality so you couldn't have a free web and travel around and see whatever you want.
[01:26:25.782 --> 01:26:27.083]  Kind of like a Chinese model.
[01:26:27.103 --> 01:26:28.604]  We barely beat that but we did beat it.
[01:26:28.884 --> 01:26:32.645]  I almost wanted to go ahead and try to shut the web down to see the revolt that will cause.
[01:26:32.965 --> 01:26:35.406]  People are now addicted to alternative information.
[01:26:35.586 --> 01:26:37.627]  I don't even claim it's all real or good info.
[01:26:37.647 --> 01:26:41.589]  The point is it's not controlled by them and it's very diverse and it's good.
[01:26:42.461 --> 01:26:45.503]  Okay, this is Reuters today.
[01:26:46.063 --> 01:26:49.245]  Bill Gates, Internet to revolutionize TV in five years.
[01:26:50.065 --> 01:26:54.828]  Mr. Gates, there are already more viewers in the U.S.
[01:26:55.128 --> 01:27:10.256]  that spend more time online and that watch television and independent clips, even mainstream clips, there are now, and we just passed this a few months ago and it was in the media, more people watching video online than there are watching all the big three networks put together and cable.
[01:27:11.603 --> 01:27:16.551]  Now, those are official numbers, so Bill Gates, tell us something we don't know five years.
[01:27:17.071 --> 01:27:17.772]  Give me a break.
[01:27:17.813 --> 01:27:20.056]  Davos, Switzerland, World Economic Forum, Reuters.
[01:27:20.586 --> 01:27:22.026]  That's the big globalist confab.
[01:27:22.066 --> 01:27:29.788]  The internet is set to revolutionize television within five years through an expansion of online video content and the merging of PCs and TV sets.
[01:27:30.088 --> 01:27:41.871]  Microsoft chairman Bill Gates said on Saturday, I'm stunned how people aren't seeing that with TV in five years from now people will laugh at what we had, he told business leaders and politicians at the World Economic Forum.
[01:27:42.191 --> 01:27:48.133]  The rise of high-speed internet and the popularity of video sites like Google, Inks, YouTube has already let
[01:27:48.573 --> 01:27:53.674]  It led to a worldwide decline in the number of hours spent by young people in front of a television set.
[01:27:54.214 --> 01:28:04.236]  In the years ahead, more and more viewers will hanker after the flexibility offered by online video and abandoned conventional broadcast television.
[01:28:04.256 --> 01:28:04.836]  They already did.
[01:28:05.296 --> 01:28:14.658]  With its fixed program slots and advertisements that interrupt shows, Gates said, certain things like elections or the Olympics really point out how TV is terrible.
[01:28:14.978 --> 01:28:20.682]  You have to wait for the guy to talk about the thing you care about or miss the event and want to go back to see it, he said.
[01:28:20.982 --> 01:28:25.125]  So as the remote control revolutionized TV, this will dwarf that, I would add.
[01:28:25.165 --> 01:28:26.806]  Those are my words there at the end.
[01:28:27.647 --> 01:28:30.088]  This is breaking them up.
[01:28:30.228 --> 01:28:32.050]  Now, they're going to shut down and restrict a lot of it.
[01:28:32.670 --> 01:28:41.456]  But the cat's out of the bag, Pandora's box is open, the dam already broke, those cows already got away, that horse already got away, she left and she ain't coming back.
[01:28:42.256 --> 01:28:44.978]  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:45.098 --> 01:28:50.080]  All the New World Order's propagandists, and all its PR men, and all the crooks can't put her back together again.
[01:28:50.341 --> 01:28:54.863]  And by the way, when we take this country back, we're gonna arrest a bunch of you and send you to prison.
[01:28:55.143 --> 01:29:01.287]  To all the politicians and scum out there listening, Americans got fat, dumb, and happy, but the sleeping giant is waking up.
[01:29:01.747 --> 01:29:02.627]  And you're in deep trouble.
[01:29:03.168 --> 01:29:03.728]  You need to know that.
[01:29:04.986 --> 01:29:06.787]  All right, we've got a break here in just a few minutes.
[01:29:06.807 --> 01:29:11.311]  When we get back, I will blitzkrieg through your calls, okay?
[01:29:11.451 --> 01:29:14.614]  John, Mike, James, David, and many others.
[01:29:14.634 --> 01:29:17.236]  I'm going to give you each about a minute, because I've got to hurry.
[01:29:17.276 --> 01:29:29.625]  I want to play this Jane Fonda comment from yesterday at this anti-war rally, and it's not her... She can say what she wants free speech, but I have a right to tell her that she's the worst possible spokeswoman.
[01:29:30.206 --> 01:29:30.906]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:30.946 --> 01:29:33.088]  InfoWars.com, PoisonPlanet.com's websites.
[01:29:53.979 --> 01:29:58.004]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[01:29:58.345 --> 01:30:01.309]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:05.575]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[01:30:06.015 --> 01:30:10.041]  Strauss Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[01:30:10.661 --> 01:30:15.162]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[01:30:16.243 --> 01:30:19.023]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[01:30:19.443 --> 01:30:20.204]  And Jim said no.
[01:30:20.684 --> 01:30:24.965]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[01:30:25.405 --> 01:30:27.906]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle, for only $79.99.
[01:30:29.526 --> 01:30:32.809]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829.
[01:30:32.829 --> 01:30:33.630]  877-817-9829.
[01:30:34.090 --> 01:30:39.414]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[01:30:39.675 --> 01:30:41.896]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[01:30:41.916 --> 01:30:42.197]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:30:42.217 --> 01:30:44.959]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[01:30:55.362 --> 01:30:56.104]  Pinch me, Bill.
[01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:57.326]  I can't believe it.
[01:30:57.767 --> 01:31:00.572]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[01:31:00.953 --> 01:31:03.438]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[01:31:04.707 --> 01:31:05.688]  You know what you mean, John.
[01:31:06.088 --> 01:31:09.811]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[01:31:10.391 --> 01:31:14.214]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:14.294 --> 01:31:15.896]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[01:31:16.336 --> 01:31:21.200]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:26.484]  And I owe it all to you, because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:26.564 --> 01:31:29.626]  Hey, John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[01:31:29.646 --> 01:31:34.510]  I want to tell everybody, because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[01:31:34.890 --> 01:31:36.571]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[01:31:36.831 --> 01:31:39.512]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.

[01:31:46.095 --> 01:31:46.916]  What a concept!

[01:32:11.172 --> 01:32:11.713]  I think so.
[01:32:26.613 --> 01:32:27.113]  I think so.
[01:32:50.546 --> 01:33:00.276]  For years, you've been hearing about Herbal Healer Academy and how it's remained a leader in effective alternative and natural medicine and education.
[01:33:00.736 --> 01:33:03.879]  But how can they continue to hold that title for years on end?

[01:34:03.662 --> 01:34:06.163]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:34:08.864 --> 01:34:09.985]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:12.057 --> 01:34:13.918]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:34:13.938 --> 01:34:15.840]  We'll be back next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:16.340]  Central.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:17.821]  I want to thank all of our great affiliates.
[01:34:17.841 --> 01:34:25.767]  If you're listening for the first time, be sure and check out InfoWars.com or JonesReport.com or PrisonPlanet.com to vet all of our claims.
[01:34:25.787 --> 01:34:26.348]  Don't believe me?
[01:34:26.388 --> 01:34:27.849]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:34:27.889 --> 01:34:29.750]  Go visit the Austin, Texas, toll party.
[01:34:30.951 --> 01:34:33.273]  Find out about groups in your area fighting against it.
[01:34:34.441 --> 01:34:39.422]  And tell folks in your area to tune in once you vet and find out we're telling you the truth.
[01:34:39.702 --> 01:34:44.883]  Let's blitz through your phone calls and then we will get into some final news.
[01:34:45.363 --> 01:34:48.083]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Arizona.
[01:34:48.423 --> 01:34:48.983]  Welcome, sir.
[01:34:49.023 --> 01:34:49.624]  You're on the air.
[01:34:50.424 --> 01:34:51.204]  Hey, Alex.
[01:34:51.624 --> 01:35:01.105]  I saw a story on Lou Dobbs, I think it was Friday, about insurgents that were driving black SUVs that actually, I guess, they killed four U.S.
[01:35:01.185 --> 01:35:01.646]  soldiers.
[01:35:02.246 --> 01:35:03.986]  And there were reports that they were dressed
[01:35:05.443 --> 01:35:05.763]  U.S.
[01:35:05.803 --> 01:35:06.904]  military uniforms?
[01:35:07.004 --> 01:35:22.537]  Well, the problem is, and this is very important, is that all the top statisticians, all the top experts, all the top people that come up with the tactics, they said keep the Ba'athists, use their military, keep it in place.
[01:35:22.597 --> 01:35:29.182]  Our CIA put it in place to begin with in 1968, and then finally in 1979 put Saddam into power, and then everything will be okay.
[01:35:30.083 --> 01:35:32.445]  But they disbanded that and hired the Shia
[01:35:33.288 --> 01:35:37.132]  And they are in our uniforms, and they let them in to engage in massacres.
[01:35:37.152 --> 01:35:38.793]  They've been caught killing U.S.
[01:35:38.813 --> 01:35:39.074]  troops.
[01:35:39.114 --> 01:35:40.034]  That's on the record.
[01:35:40.635 --> 01:35:45.059]  And I've interviewed Ray McGovern, the Chief CIA Analyst for Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr.
[01:35:45.379 --> 01:35:52.166]  saying clearly British troops have been caught staging terror attacks to get the two different groups, the Shia and the Sunni, fighting with each other.
[01:35:52.426 --> 01:35:57.471]  The goal is to keep it in civil war, build permanent bases, and then export revolution to nearby countries.
[01:35:58.248 --> 01:36:07.694]  Yeah, actually, that's what rung the bell to me was that one story about the UK SAS officers that got caught killing Iraqi police officers.
[01:36:07.714 --> 01:36:08.314]  That's what it sounded like.
[01:36:08.334 --> 01:36:13.797]  Yeah, Times of London dressed up like Arabs with a bunch of explosives, running around posing as Shia.
[01:36:14.197 --> 01:36:14.698]  Absolutely.
[01:36:14.718 --> 01:36:15.518]  Appreciate your call.
[01:36:15.558 --> 01:36:16.779]  Thanks for holding to ask that.
[01:36:17.699 --> 01:36:21.342]  Let us now go ahead and talk to John in Nevada.
[01:36:21.782 --> 01:36:23.023]  John, you're on the air.
[01:36:23.063 --> 01:36:23.743]  Thank you for holding.
[01:36:24.904 --> 01:36:25.684]  Hi, Alex.
[01:36:25.824 --> 01:36:26.064]  Hello.
[01:36:27.426 --> 01:36:33.488]  What can you tell me about these juror questionnaires they send out for jury duty, and they ask you a bunch of questions on them?
[01:36:34.788 --> 01:36:37.869]  Well, they're finding out if you're the type of police state minion they want.
[01:36:37.889 --> 01:36:48.592]  You know, they start out saying it's to find out if you're a cop and you're recused, or it's to find out, you know, if you have a conflict of interest or you're a felon, or if you're involved in the industry that this trial's involved in.
[01:36:48.612 --> 01:36:50.073]  It's for the lawyers on both sides.
[01:36:50.873 --> 01:36:55.777]  But they've gotten way... you know, the judge tells the jury what to do instead of the other way around.
[01:36:55.817 --> 01:36:56.818]  I appreciate your call.
[01:36:57.119 --> 01:36:59.380]  The jury is to judge the facts as well as the law.
[01:36:59.641 --> 01:37:01.062]  It's another form of ballot box.
[01:37:01.082 --> 01:37:03.864]  You have the jury box, the ballot box, and the grand jury box.
[01:37:04.104 --> 01:37:06.306]  And you are above the law when you're a juror or grand juror.
[01:37:06.466 --> 01:37:09.569]  You're not supposed to have the prosecutor or the judge telling you what to do.
[01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:11.290]  So just keep your mouth shut.
[01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:12.751]  Look into jury nullification.
[01:37:13.071 --> 01:37:14.092]  Type that into Google.
[01:37:14.272 --> 01:37:16.553]  You'll find out what your real duties are as a U.S.
[01:37:16.573 --> 01:37:16.914]  citizen.
[01:37:16.934 --> 01:37:19.455]  That's why the National Bar Association is calling to get rid of juries.
[01:37:19.675 --> 01:37:20.596]  They're doing it in England.
[01:37:20.616 --> 01:37:21.357]  They're doing it in Europe.
[01:37:21.557 --> 01:37:22.377]  It's a form of tyranny.
[01:37:22.397 --> 01:37:23.818]  They don't have juries in Communist China.
[01:37:24.098 --> 01:37:25.759]  Nazi Germany didn't have juries, boys and girls.
[01:37:26.260 --> 01:37:27.821]  The first thing Hitler did was abolish those.
[01:37:28.541 --> 01:37:32.584]  Now let us go to David in Texas.
[01:37:32.944 --> 01:37:33.865]  David, you're on the air.
[01:37:33.905 --> 01:37:34.605]  Thank you for holding.
[01:37:35.066 --> 01:37:35.586]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:35.686 --> 01:37:36.306]  Alex Jones.
[01:37:36.326 --> 01:37:37.067]  This is David.
[01:37:37.819 --> 01:37:43.962]  I stumbled upon your website a couple weeks ago, and I'm trying to get somebody to help me.
[01:37:44.702 --> 01:37:48.644]  What you call the New World Order, what you call Illuminati.
[01:37:48.664 --> 01:37:49.344]  It's a tyranny.
[01:37:49.804 --> 01:37:50.664]  A tyranny.
[01:37:50.985 --> 01:37:52.345]  I call it an axis of evil.
[01:37:52.705 --> 01:37:54.846]  They've been conspiring against me since 1999.
[01:37:55.907 --> 01:37:58.548]  I was in Prague in 1999.
[01:37:58.848 --> 01:38:03.990]  They came to me on the TV, asked me if I wanted to be one of them, and then launched a conspiracy
[01:38:05.319 --> 01:38:05.900]  All right, sir.
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.561]  We lost your call.
[01:38:07.761 --> 01:38:09.522]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:38:10.383 --> 01:38:14.285]  We're going to go to some more calls here at the end of the show.
[01:38:15.466 --> 01:38:19.069]  But before we do that, I wanted to get into Jane Fonda.
[01:38:19.089 --> 01:38:19.629]  Let's be clear.
[01:38:20.150 --> 01:38:23.212]  I'm against the Iraq War because our government created Saddam, put him into power.
[01:38:23.232 --> 01:38:24.793]  That is, the black ops that control our government.
[01:38:24.993 --> 01:38:25.713]  The shadow government.
[01:38:25.894 --> 01:38:27.315]  This is historical, mainstream news.
[01:38:27.335 --> 01:38:28.155]  If you just go research it.
[01:38:28.175 --> 01:38:29.296]  It's in the encyclopedia.
[01:38:29.636 --> 01:38:31.317]  Saddam's CIA until at least 1990.
[01:38:31.498 --> 01:38:33.179]  Then they shut him up.
[01:38:33.479 --> 01:38:34.260]  No fan of Saddam.
[01:38:34.300 --> 01:38:34.860]  Terrible person.
[01:38:35.749 --> 01:38:37.331]  But, they put him into power.
[01:38:37.771 --> 01:38:38.812]  This is all part of the record.
[01:38:39.192 --> 01:38:41.554]  They gave him the WMDs and they destroyed him in 1991.
[01:38:41.595 --> 01:38:42.455]  The UN went in in 1993.
[01:38:42.656 --> 01:38:45.078]  The weapons inspectors went on record and said this.
[01:38:45.678 --> 01:38:47.740]  Then they had 16 years now of sanctions.
[01:38:47.940 --> 01:38:48.941]  3 million dead Iraqis.
[01:38:49.021 --> 01:38:56.268]  Lancet, British Medical Journal, very well respected, says 654,000 dead just in the last three and a half years since the invasion.
[01:38:57.049 --> 01:38:58.250]  Accelerating that death.
[01:38:59.288 --> 01:39:12.673]  And Bush, we have the White House memo now, where he, and they admit this is an accurate memo, released by British intelligence, Bush is real mad it got released with him and Blair, six months before the March 2003 attack on Iraq, saying we've got to stage WMD fines.
[01:39:13.013 --> 01:39:13.534]  Word for word.
[01:39:13.554 --> 01:39:15.995]  We've got to have fake defectors come out and claim they've seen them.
[01:39:16.015 --> 01:39:16.535]  Lie about it.
[01:39:16.695 --> 01:39:19.596]  Just like the fake yellow cake uranium.
[01:39:19.656 --> 01:39:21.197]  You don't lie to the American people.
[01:39:21.537 --> 01:39:23.338]  Then it came out last year that in 2004 and 5, 1.8 billion.
[01:39:23.438 --> 01:39:24.018]  Just type that in.
[01:39:27.492 --> 01:39:29.554]  The first news article said 1.6 and it was revised to 1.8.
[01:39:30.395 --> 01:39:34.939]  In fake news, the Congress ruled, the oversight body, that that's illegal.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.022]  The Pentagon buying fake news, buying fake reporters.
[01:39:38.223 --> 01:39:43.428]  You heard about Armstrong Williams, that was the Department of Labor, that's the tip of the iceberg to go pitch No Child Left Behind.
[01:39:43.588 --> 01:39:46.711]  It's just $1.8 billion just for pro-war propaganda.
[01:39:47.331 --> 01:39:49.814]  Domestically, fake news, buying off reporters.
[01:39:50.458 --> 01:39:51.738]  I guess there's more ways to skin a cat.
[01:39:51.778 --> 01:39:54.859]  I guess the toll road companies, foreigners, just come in and buy up the newspapers.
[01:39:54.879 --> 01:39:55.980]  Well, this is the opposite.
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:58.120]  It's a variant.
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:39:59.621]  You just go buy the writers.
[01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:01.521]  This is incredible!
[01:40:02.141 --> 01:40:03.262]  I mean, this is not freedom!
[01:40:03.802 --> 01:40:11.704]  But we don't want Jane Fonda running around, who got up on top of anti-aircraft guns, in Vietnam against our airmen.
[01:40:12.445 --> 01:40:13.785]  Against our fighter-bomber pilots.
[01:40:14.597 --> 01:40:22.640]  And Jane Fonda has so much dirt in her closet, and all these people like Susan Sarandon and the rest of them, and their own Democratic Party, Hillary and the rest of them are a bunch of warmongers.
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:25.841]  And so when they go public, that balkanizes people.
[01:40:26.321 --> 01:40:27.681]  And look, she can go speak.
[01:40:28.422 --> 01:40:37.085]  She can go speak, says what she wants, but I'm here to say that she's been quiet for years because she knows how it discredits her causes.
[01:40:37.125 --> 01:40:40.426]  So I agree with what she says, but I don't agree with her going out and doing it.
[01:40:40.446 --> 01:40:41.106]  I'm just saying that.
[01:40:41.426 --> 01:40:43.907]  Let's go ahead and roll that tape of her yesterday at the anti-war march.
[01:40:45.151 --> 01:40:45.552]  Here it is.
[01:40:46.092 --> 01:40:53.182]  This is Jane Condon.
[01:40:54.824 --> 01:40:57.387]  I'm really here because I want to thank you all.
[01:40:57.487 --> 01:41:02.174]  I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for being here today.
[01:41:03.186 --> 01:41:16.615]  So many of you, so many of today's speakers, including my fellow actors up here, were here at the very beginning, before we went into Iraq, because you knew, and they knew, what was in store.
[01:41:17.956 --> 01:41:25.001]  Thank you so much for the courage to stand up against this mean-spirited, vengeful administration.
[01:41:30.545 --> 01:41:32.126]  Your actions are proof
[01:41:33.351 --> 01:41:40.239]  That the most precious part of this country, its soul, is alive and well.
[01:41:40.379 --> 01:41:41.280]  So thank you.
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:44.163]  Alright, that's Jane Fonda.
[01:41:44.443 --> 01:41:47.246]  Your ongoing commitment to... That's Jane Fonda.
[01:41:47.266 --> 01:41:48.247]  We're almost out of time here.
[01:41:48.267 --> 01:41:50.810]  I want to take a few final calls as promised.
[01:41:51.776 --> 01:42:03.123]  I mean, you couldn't have a better poster child and a worse poster child to make conservatives, who are against the war now in the majority, go back to being pro-war by having Jane Fonda out there, and the stupid left doesn't understand that.
[01:42:03.143 --> 01:42:04.864]  And they wouldn't talk about 9-11 truth there either.
[01:42:05.484 --> 01:42:11.988]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bob in San Antonio, Texas, listening to Radio 590 KLVJ.
[01:42:12.368 --> 01:42:13.569]  Thank you for holding her on the air.
[01:42:13.629 --> 01:42:14.289]  Please make it quick.
[01:42:14.690 --> 01:42:15.490]  Hey, Alex.
[01:42:16.551 --> 01:42:19.352]  I attended one of these dog and pony shows conducted by TxOT.
[01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:25.119]  And those SOBs tried to get me thrown out by armed police officers.
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:29.507]  One of their engineers said I must face him and not the crowd.
[01:42:30.248 --> 01:42:30.788]  At the meeting.
[01:42:31.589 --> 01:42:39.232]  Oh yeah, they look for any reason to harass the thousands of people or hundreds, depending on the meeting, that show up and they say, you can't face the crowd when you speak to the commission.
[01:42:39.493 --> 01:42:40.973]  You must face the gods.
[01:42:40.993 --> 01:42:42.014]  You must be respectful.
[01:42:42.414 --> 01:42:42.894]  Precisely.
[01:42:42.934 --> 01:42:45.015]  I mean, they don't understand that they work for us.
[01:42:45.856 --> 01:42:46.736]  That's called tyranny.
[01:42:46.756 --> 01:42:52.619]  When the government gets bought off by private interest and tells you that they're the boss, they're the authority, they're the official.
[01:42:52.819 --> 01:42:54.140]  In the past, they were called servants.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:54.920]  Right.
[01:42:55.281 --> 01:42:57.463]  Hey, before I go... What did the cops do?
[01:42:57.503 --> 01:42:58.223]  What ended up happening?
[01:42:58.484 --> 01:43:04.309]  Well, three of them, all armed, surrounded me, and they started pulling me away from the microphone.
[01:43:04.609 --> 01:43:05.830]  Which text-op meeting was this?
[01:43:06.491 --> 01:43:14.398]  This is one of the schools along Route 281 that they want to confiscate and turn into a... Well, I hope you'll find out who was there and get me video, sir.
[01:43:14.438 --> 01:43:15.059]  That's incredible.
[01:43:15.299 --> 01:43:16.660]  Hey, we do have videos on that.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:16.860]  We do.
[01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:22.123]  Okay, mail it to me with a letter saying I can use it and writing a brief statement about what happened.
[01:43:22.363 --> 01:43:23.844]  I'll post it on YouTube for you.
[01:43:24.044 --> 01:43:27.005]  I'll put it up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:43:27.045 --> 01:43:28.346]  I've got just a minute or two left.
[01:43:28.366 --> 01:43:29.847]  About time to go to more calls here.
[01:43:30.387 --> 01:43:33.729]  Alright, let's see who's been holding the longest here.
[01:43:34.569 --> 01:43:37.771]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Utah.
[01:43:37.791 --> 01:43:38.412]  You're on the air.
[01:43:38.452 --> 01:43:39.152]  Go ahead, Rob.
[01:43:39.312 --> 01:43:39.932]  Hey, Alex.
[01:43:40.032 --> 01:43:41.073]  Hey, great guy.
[01:43:41.473 --> 01:43:44.175]  First got turned on to you via Google, The Truth 9-11.
[01:43:46.105 --> 01:43:49.727]  Ah, at first I thought you were a little radical, but the more and more I listen to you, you know what?
[01:43:49.747 --> 01:43:50.647]  You're making a lot of sense.
[01:43:50.687 --> 01:43:52.648]  I'm upset foreign corporations are seizing everything.
[01:43:52.728 --> 01:43:53.468]  I'm a little upset.
[01:43:53.668 --> 01:43:54.528]  Hey, hey, you know what?
[01:43:54.568 --> 01:43:59.330]  Here in Utah, we're swarmed with illegals, and it's a serious crisis like the rest of the nation.
[01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:03.312]  Hey, what do you think about websites like numbers.usa and fairus.org?
[01:44:04.409 --> 01:44:12.751]  I think that that's really good information about what's happening to our sovereignty with the 30 million plus illegal aliens and Bush and the Clintons' amnesty plan they're trying to pass right now.
[01:44:13.632 --> 01:44:17.773]  What about the 80 million that have been loopholed in the previous 20 years?
[01:44:18.113 --> 01:44:20.993]  I don't know if it's 80 million, it's more like 30 million, but thank you.
[01:44:21.674 --> 01:44:22.414]  We're out of time!
[01:44:23.234 --> 01:44:26.275]  Yeah, 3 million illegals come in a year and 900 and something thousand illegals.
[01:44:26.315 --> 01:44:27.095]  That's way too many.
[01:44:28.355 --> 01:44:30.136]  See you back next week.
[01:44:31.376 --> 01:44:31.937]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:44:31.957 --> 01:44:32.278]  Central.
[01:44:32.338 --> 01:44:34.243]  All the affiliates, the sponsors, the folks running the show.
[01:44:34.624 --> 01:44:35.406]  Everybody, God bless you.
[01:44:35.426 --> 01:44:38.774]  I'll see you at Book People tonight in downtown Austin from 8 to 10 p.m.
[01:44:38.794 --> 01:44:39.115]  Take care.
[01:44:42.459 --> 01:44:43.500]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.423]  Over the years, Genesis Communications Network has grown by leaps and bounds, reaching millions of listeners.
[01:44:48.523 --> 01:44:51.425]  The impact on political and social issues have been enormous.
[01:44:51.565 --> 01:44:55.567]  Businesses associated with the network have grown to become valuable enterprises.
[01:44:55.887 --> 01:45:01.891]  If you are accredited and have an entrepreneurial spirit, national radio may be the opportunity you're looking for.
[01:45:02.071 --> 01:45:03.312]  Call me today at 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:03.352 --> 01:45:04.733]  For more information, that's 877-996-4327, extension 101.
[01:45:13.331 --> 01:45:15.792]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:45:16.272 --> 01:45:18.172]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:45:18.893 --> 01:45:22.054]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:22.714 --> 01:45:29.176]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
