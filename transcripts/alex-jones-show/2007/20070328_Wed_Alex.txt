[00:00:05.583 --> 00:00:06.224]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:07.945]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:09.767]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:11.228]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.988 --> 00:00:12.889]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.753 --> 00:00:21.856]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.465]  Well, I'm down here in Austin, Texas, in the geographic heart of the great state of Texas, Austin.
[00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.372]  The network is up in Minneapolis, St.
[00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:36.773]  Paul, Minnesota.
[00:00:36.793 --> 00:00:38.234]  Up there in the great north.
[00:00:40.016 --> 00:00:46.261]  And yesterday I had one of those rare technical problems that didn't allow me to connect into the satellite uplinks.
[00:00:46.842 --> 00:00:47.983]  So we ran a rebroadcast.
[00:00:48.003 --> 00:00:50.665]  I apologize for not being here yesterday.
[00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:53.327]  But I am here live today.
[00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:59.333]  And we have the folks ahead of the website and the organization Free Our Kids.
[00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:18.428]  Looking at the incredible abuse and wickedness by the federally funded Child Protective Services at the state level, the child kidnapping, the child raping, just the incredible abuse that these criminals engage in with almost complete and total impunity.
[00:01:19.989 --> 00:01:22.951]  So that's coming up in the third hour today.
[00:01:23.051 --> 00:01:28.674]  In the first two hours we're going to talk about Target Iran and it is clear that
[00:01:29.378 --> 00:01:32.680]  There are serious preparations that have been made.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:43.647]  The gun is to the head, the hammer has been pulled back, and the finger is beginning the squeeze down onto the trigger.
[00:01:45.148 --> 00:01:54.134]  So I thought we'd talk about the buildup and the evidence that points towards military attack in the near future, and then talk about the aftermath of that.
[00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.134]  What would that cause?
[00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:55.675]  What would that do?
[00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.031]  What would the response be in the world economy?
[00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:01.151]  What would happen to the dollar?
[00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:02.472]  What will happen to oil prices?
[00:02:02.812 --> 00:02:04.873]  How will Iran respond?
[00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:09.635]  And I specifically want to have callers call in on this issue.
[00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:13.256]  I rarely tell you, hey, I want to talk about this issue.
[00:02:14.577 --> 00:02:15.898]  And we don't screen your calls.
[00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:18.159]  We ask what your first name is and where you're calling from.
[00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:26.242]  But quite frankly, I would really like it if you would, at least in this first hour, try to stick to Iran.
[00:02:27.285 --> 00:02:29.005]  No, I'm going to bring up some other issues.
[00:02:30.626 --> 00:02:32.806]  So how can I tell you not to bring up other issues?
[00:02:33.347 --> 00:02:34.327]  It's just so important.
[00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:46.390]  I think we really should focus on it and have a serious discussion because this will be the kickoff of a serious war and something that economically is going to have serious repercussions and could lead
[00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.167]  In fact, there is a very good chance.
[00:02:49.287 --> 00:03:03.630]  I don't know if it's a 50-50, but it's probably a 30, 35, maybe 40 percent chance that it could lead to World War III, a massive regional conflict spreading into a worldwide conflict.
[00:03:05.391 --> 00:03:08.571]  In fact, a lot of experts are saying China may go ahead and move on Taiwan.
[00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:11.132]  There's no telling what Pakistan will do with its nukes.
[00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:12.112]  India has nukes.
[00:03:13.047 --> 00:03:19.809]  North Korea, the globalists are trying to get a deal with them before they strike because they're worried about North Korea on the flank.
[00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.092]  This is very, very serious times that we are all living in right now.
[00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:36.315]  Some of the news that I have here in front of me on this subject, Russian intelligence sees U.S.
[00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.036]  military buildup on Iran border.
[00:03:39.597 --> 00:03:40.457]  Another headline,
[00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:43.066]  Will U.S.
[00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:44.447]  attack Iran?
[00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:48.671]  Brits to be paraded on TV.
[00:03:52.214 --> 00:03:52.854]  Two U.S.
[00:03:52.914 --> 00:03:58.239]  carriers engulf war games for first time since 2003 invasion.
[00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:03.403]  Prime Minister warns Iran over Navy captains.
[00:04:04.424 --> 00:04:06.326]  Says there's going to be a new phase.
[00:04:07.887 --> 00:04:09.689]  And a quote, frozen diplomacy.
[00:04:10.504 --> 00:04:17.068]  We have Western governments embassies staff preparing for evacuation.
[00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:24.433]  Israel doing huge national drills saying they may strike any day and bring the United States into it.
[00:04:25.834 --> 00:04:29.476]  Gulf economies to quote drop the dollar that is confirmed.
[00:04:29.496 --> 00:04:32.558]  A lot of listeners have been asking about that.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.703]  Meanwhile we've got other little issues like the largest tax hike in American history being prepared.
[00:04:43.317 --> 00:04:44.558]  Oh my gosh.
[00:04:44.638 --> 00:04:48.802]  It's just... I don't know how I'm ever going to get to it all, but we're going to try.
[00:04:49.842 --> 00:04:53.725]  We've got the big Texas CPS pedophile scandal.
[00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:55.727]  Prison scandal.
[00:04:57.168 --> 00:04:57.909]  My head's spinning.
[00:04:57.929 --> 00:05:00.371]  We're going to try to cover it all in the next three hours.
[00:05:04.329 --> 00:05:09.778]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.138 --> 00:05:17.790]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:25.514]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.914 --> 00:05:37.380]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.603]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:43.544]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.884 --> 00:05:47.726]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.929 --> 00:06:10.996]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:22.466]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.806 --> 00:06:27.650]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.010]  I think?
[00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:49.983]  Let's get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:06:50.784 --> 00:06:51.705]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.725 --> 00:06:51.925]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.945 --> 00:06:53.546]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:04.154]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:04.654 --> 00:07:07.955]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:07:08.335 --> 00:07:11.276]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:17.938]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:07:17.998 --> 00:07:22.420]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.002]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:07:27.163 --> 00:07:29.784]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:07:29.804 --> 00:07:32.565]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:07:33.026 --> 00:07:35.567]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:07:35.607 --> 00:07:39.869]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:07:39.929 --> 00:07:40.770]  Treasury bonds.
[00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.692]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:07:45.852 --> 00:07:50.653]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:50.913 --> 00:07:59.296]  That's 1-888-8-XANADU, or 1-888-8-X-A-N-A-D-U, and ask for George.
[00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:08.719]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:17.248 --> 00:08:26.514]  We have the embattled Attorney General, now accused in sex scandal cover-up, Attorney General Gonzalez among officials, who allegedly ignored abuse of minor boys.
[00:08:29.156 --> 00:08:37.241]  And... I really prepared Monday night for yesterday's show, then I was unable to do it for several different circumstances I had come up.
[00:08:39.943 --> 00:08:43.325]  And I literally, no exaggeration, I probably got 40, 50 articles here.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:55.168]  I mean, I did three or four hours of research alone Monday night on this and prepared a big show yesterday and then was unable to get on air because of technical issues, number one.
[00:08:57.189 --> 00:09:02.653]  A true rarity, but it does happen occasionally because of the long-distance connections between my show and the network.
[00:09:02.954 --> 00:09:03.954]  But I already mentioned that earlier.
[00:09:03.974 --> 00:09:11.200]  I have this giant stack over here with headlines like this, Texas Rangers Child Rape Investigation Stymied.
[00:09:12.034 --> 00:09:22.358]  There are hundreds of Texas News articles, and the really bad ones are in the local towns right around all these juvenile justice facilities, these prisons.
[00:09:23.318 --> 00:09:33.742]  And folks, we're talking about children who are eight years old, and a student monitor shoves them.
[00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:53.921]  And so they shoved them back and then they used the code to say it was a police officer because they were in the capacity of a state employee and so the child is given a year in juvenile hall and then the year is over and the child is kept there and it's in one of these facilities where they have the rape rooms.
[00:09:55.157 --> 00:09:55.517]  I don't
[00:10:14.133 --> 00:10:14.994]  Here's the problem.
[00:10:16.275 --> 00:10:17.215]  It's just so important.
[00:10:17.536 --> 00:10:18.837]  And this is the frustration.
[00:10:18.857 --> 00:10:30.626]  This is why I end up talking fast and getting mad and going 90 miles an hour because literally there are like... Every day there's 10-15 big issues I want to talk about.
[00:10:30.666 --> 00:10:31.807]  We end up talking about 3 or 4.
[00:10:33.148 --> 00:10:34.388]  But here's an example of my life.
[00:10:35.669 --> 00:10:37.431]  Monday night, I'm down at the TV station.
[00:10:38.463 --> 00:10:44.026]  And I am doing the hour-long TV program that we then upload to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:10:45.966 --> 00:10:56.511]  And Mike Hanson, running the show, walks in live on TV and puts in front of me a picture of a Mexican child beaten what looked like half to death.
[00:10:57.632 --> 00:10:59.192]  And the photos rung a bell.
[00:11:00.753 --> 00:11:05.295]  I went, you know, I know that picture.
[00:11:05.876 --> 00:11:07.597]  But I mean, he just walked in and laid it in front of me.
[00:11:07.617 --> 00:11:10.059]  I didn't know what to say on live TV.
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:20.528]  And then when I get off the TV show, and I walk out in the hall, there is a gentleman, Ricardo Luna, out in the hall.
[00:11:20.608 --> 00:11:22.629]  Now, he was there to go on another TV show.
[00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.911]  I think he was there to go on the Ritter Show.
[00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:32.317]  I'm not sure, because after it clicked, I later called up there after I'd left, and I couldn't get a hold of him, and Ricardo Luna
[00:11:33.248 --> 00:11:38.894]  He's filed a $5 million lawsuit for what happened to his son in these facilities.
[00:11:40.315 --> 00:11:45.801]  Well, I interviewed Mr. Luna like four or five years ago, maybe longer, and I recognized him.
[00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:47.823]  And I said, oh yeah, hi, Mr. Luna.
[00:11:48.364 --> 00:11:50.326]  My brain was trying to click, but I just got off TV.
[00:11:50.346 --> 00:11:52.187]  You know, people talking to me in the hall.
[00:11:52.207 --> 00:11:53.329]  There's a lot of folks at the station.
[00:11:53.349 --> 00:11:55.591]  You know, hey, Alex, and hey, how you doing?
[00:11:56.334 --> 00:12:00.256]  And then I'm busy getting equipment out, and he's going, yeah, thank you for your help many years ago.
[00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:01.576]  You know, he's still in there.
[00:12:02.217 --> 00:12:03.417]  It's Judge Gene Mear.
[00:12:04.238 --> 00:12:17.123]  And his case started when his son, who's also retarded, that's right folks, retarded, supposedly pushed a hall monitor again.
[00:12:17.243 --> 00:12:19.084]  It was the same thing, but it was just pushed him.
[00:12:19.625 --> 00:12:20.545]  And he never went in trouble.
[00:12:21.627 --> 00:12:30.131]  And he disappeared into this system, I mean, where they torture him and do everything else you can imagine in these rape and torture camps.
[00:12:30.231 --> 00:12:31.132]  And folks, that's what they are.
[00:12:31.172 --> 00:12:38.215]  I mean, you have to realize this is, remember, thousands of criminals, thousands of felons, 3,000 children missing in Florida.
[00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.277]  I mean, this is a massive scandal.
[00:12:42.277 --> 00:12:44.678]  Can you imagine if the Iranians had 3,000 of our children?
[00:12:44.698 --> 00:12:45.098]  What would happen?
[00:12:45.118 --> 00:12:46.299]  They'd be nuked in 10 seconds.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.524]  But no, CPS in Florida, 3,000 missing, it was on CNN a few times, never heard about it again.
[00:12:51.744 --> 00:12:56.528]  Because they kept digging up their dead bodies and it was just, we better, we better get quiet about this right now.
[00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:01.012]  By the way, don't roll your eyes driving around in your car out there.
[00:13:01.032 --> 00:13:03.134]  You better go check out my claims I just made.
[00:13:04.695 --> 00:13:08.799]  When I say Dyncor and Halliburton are running giant child kidnapping rings, you need to go pull it up.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:12.502]  Don't you just sit there and say I'm lying.
[00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:13.583]  You need to find out it's true.
[00:13:14.502 --> 00:13:18.204]  Then you need to go get nauseated and throw up and get freaked out.
[00:13:19.564 --> 00:13:24.246]  Roll around in your bed in the middle of the night until you grow some spinal cords.
[00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:28.368]  Because it is scary to admit what we're in, folks.
[00:13:28.488 --> 00:13:33.790]  It is... A big publication yesterday, I want to try to get to it later, called me a professional scaremonger.
[00:13:35.611 --> 00:13:39.072]  Well, yeah, I am trying to scare people.
[00:13:39.412 --> 00:13:41.313]  I am trying to get people to get motivated.
[00:13:42.288 --> 00:13:44.709]  I am trying to just tell the truth, though.
[00:13:44.749 --> 00:13:46.090]  I don't set about to scare people.
[00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:48.150]  I mean, this stuff is scary.
[00:13:48.871 --> 00:13:49.551]  I'm concerned.
[00:13:49.751 --> 00:13:50.451]  I'm freaked out.
[00:13:51.372 --> 00:13:54.653]  That's where I get my energy to fight this, because I realize how serious it is.
[00:13:55.533 --> 00:14:07.678]  And if you're not scared about the dollar plunging, and if you're not scared about the borders disappearing, and if you're not scared about the North American Union, and if you're not scared about World War III about to start, there's something wrong with you.
[00:14:08.897 --> 00:14:18.942]  And if you're not scared about every major juvenile justice hall in Texas being a rape room, then you've got a major problem.
[00:14:19.522 --> 00:14:20.702]  And by the way, it's nationwide.
[00:14:23.524 --> 00:14:29.406]  So, I'm already digressing and I said I'd get into Iran, but imagine, this is my wife.
[00:14:29.686 --> 00:14:33.088]  So I'm sitting there talking to Ricardo Luna, and I remember he had CPS trouble.
[00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:35.969]  And I remember he had juvenile justice trouble.
[00:14:36.787 --> 00:14:38.308]  And I was like, oh great, great to see you.
[00:14:38.368 --> 00:14:41.590]  And he's like, yeah, I'm going to go to the governor's office soon.
[00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:42.551]  We're going to protest them.
[00:14:43.011 --> 00:14:44.893]  We're going to expose this.
[00:14:45.333 --> 00:14:48.575]  It's finally breaking, what they did to my son and thousands of others.
[00:14:50.716 --> 00:14:59.903]  And then I go home and I get on the computer and my wife and I get on the computer.
[00:14:59.923 --> 00:15:02.504]  We're both on computers side by side doing research on this.
[00:15:02.604 --> 00:15:03.885]  She's going, oh my God, look at this.
[00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:04.726]  Oh my God, look at that.
[00:15:05.541 --> 00:15:06.562]  Oh, we ought to interview this person.
[00:15:06.582 --> 00:15:07.663]  You ought to interview that person.
[00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.325]  And she goes, oh, look at this.
[00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:11.807]  This is Rick Luna right here in Austin.
[00:15:12.487 --> 00:15:13.608]  You ought to talk to him.
[00:15:13.628 --> 00:15:17.072]  And I look over and I go, Rick Luna?
[00:15:17.552 --> 00:15:21.776]  And it was Rick Luna in the same black t-shirt with the same, you know, slogan.
[00:15:21.796 --> 00:15:29.222]  And he leads thousands of Texans now, mainly Hispanics, who get fed on by these groups, by the crime syndicate.
[00:15:30.724 --> 00:15:31.825]  And there was Rick Luna.
[00:15:32.938 --> 00:15:34.759]  And he's all over the Texas newspapers.
[00:15:34.819 --> 00:15:37.501]  And see, we covered him, I think it was like five years ago.
[00:15:37.521 --> 00:15:43.024]  I mean, literally, we were on this five years ago, and I've seen so much evil, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:43.705 --> 00:15:45.606]  And he was on the TV show, on the radio.
[00:15:46.426 --> 00:15:49.908]  Kevin Smith and Mike Hanson went to the court cases.
[00:15:50.789 --> 00:15:51.789]  Okay, I've been to some of these.
[00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:52.650]  I didn't go to Luna's.
[00:15:53.912 --> 00:16:08.443]  It's Judge Jean Meir, the one who runs a giant, sprawling fortress of doom for the children, that they're always adding on to for all the children they snatch, and there's no due process, and she just screams at parents and threatens to arrest them until they sign all their rights over.
[00:16:08.503 --> 00:16:11.465]  I mean, it's a Soviet show trial, but it's public!
[00:16:11.505 --> 00:16:14.427]  They don't hide it in some subterranean pit!
[00:16:14.888 --> 00:16:15.868]  Man, not in America!
[00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:16.329]  No, no, no, no!
[00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:21.913]  Pure Nazi-slash-Soviet-style gulag evil is right out in the open!
[00:16:23.268 --> 00:16:26.881]  And they got armored SWAT teams with machine guns ready to enforce their will.
[00:16:29.984 --> 00:16:47.416]  And they'll kick your door down looking for the drugs their boss has shipped in, and they'll do all this stuff, but when they're systematically raping the children, and systematically torturing them, and systematically doing all this evil, and masses of them die in custody, and I'm talking toddlers, folks, in many cases, nothing will be done.
[00:16:47.816 --> 00:16:53.320]  And your child pushes somebody, your child gets in a fistfight now, like you or I did, it's prison, folks.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.241]  Life's over.
[00:16:55.162 --> 00:16:55.702]  Life's over.
[00:16:57.384 --> 00:17:05.170]  Because with the family courts they set up back in the fifties to deal with the scourge of juvenile problems, they have erased total due process.
[00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:13.076]  And so it's just entering them into the system with the big prisons owned by the private money laundering banks for the drug cartels.
[00:17:13.456 --> 00:17:15.157]  We are run by the drug cartels.
[00:17:15.738 --> 00:17:20.642]  Our government is a drug cartel, both legal and illegal, with the big pharma ads everywhere.
[00:17:21.142 --> 00:17:22.383]  We're in the ninth circle of hell.
[00:17:23.343 --> 00:17:26.686]  And you could have Texas Rangers and state police go public all day about this.
[00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:28.127]  Nothing's going to happen.
[00:17:28.147 --> 00:17:32.911]  They're going to arrest maybe five or six people and have a new commission about it.
[00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:38.596]  And then the legislature is stalling, blocking the governor who is doing nothing.
[00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:40.377]  There's bills to stop him.
[00:17:41.098 --> 00:17:42.339]  And this is who they are.
[00:17:44.545 --> 00:18:08.307]  And the White House is going to continue to have gay porn stars in there every night, and gay madams, and they're going to continue, like they did in the 80s, to have the quote, underage frolics in the White House, mainstream news, Washington Times, and they're going to start more wars, and they're going to take your dollar, and they're going to blow out your stock market, they're going to do everything they want to you, and you're going to sit there and take it until you decide to get mad and stand up and fight these people.
[00:18:09.893 --> 00:18:12.276]  Okay, there, I got some of it off my chest about that.
[00:18:12.376 --> 00:18:29.095]  I just get so angry that all this stuff builds up on me and piles up and I want to cover it and I say I'm going to get up here on air and cover Iran war and it's literally weighing on my mind wanting to expose it.
[00:18:29.841 --> 00:18:30.642]  Wanting to fight it.
[00:18:31.122 --> 00:18:33.604]  Like a WAIT until I talk about it.
[00:18:34.064 --> 00:18:35.565]  And I guess this is my therapy here.
[00:18:35.585 --> 00:18:39.408]  Some people would call me weak.
[00:18:39.448 --> 00:18:40.929]  They would say that I'm a softy.
[00:18:40.949 --> 00:18:41.849]  That I've got problems.
[00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:43.491]  That I care about other people.
[00:18:43.511 --> 00:18:47.493]  That I feel it is my responsibility to defend these people.
[00:18:49.235 --> 00:18:51.756]  And that's what I've said to Mecha and La Raza and all these groups.
[00:18:51.776 --> 00:18:56.620]  Say, why don't you stop trying to amass power for your capos and your racial leaders.
[00:18:58.099 --> 00:19:03.283]  in the corrupt system and why don't you go out and fight for the Hispanic children that are being fed on?
[00:19:03.743 --> 00:19:12.869]  Why don't the black leaders fight how black children are grabbed and have drugs and pesticides tested on them until death instead of just running around griping and talking about your race all day?
[00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.750]  Whites!
[00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.831]  You feel like you're on top of everything.
[00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:17.232]  You feel like you're the boss of everything.
[00:19:17.452 --> 00:19:22.636]  So you go along with whatever Republican leadership does like you're the boss and you're in the catbird seat.
[00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:26.093]  I mean, I don't know how you don't have a weight on you.
[00:19:26.453 --> 00:19:30.196]  How you don't have a literal, it's like a weight on the front of my face, a weight on my chest.
[00:19:31.037 --> 00:19:35.020]  When I'm not on air, and I get upset by this stuff, and I want to talk about it, I want to fight it.
[00:19:36.762 --> 00:19:37.903]  It is a literal weight.
[00:19:40.325 --> 00:19:41.726]  And when I talk about it, I feel better.
[00:19:41.746 --> 00:19:45.529]  Because at least I know more people are warned about these criminals.
[00:19:45.609 --> 00:19:47.731]  And more and more of us are waking up others.
[00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:49.032]  And we're that much closer.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.821]  To getting our hands around their throats.
[00:19:52.841 --> 00:19:58.124]  Alright, I will get to Iran on the other side and we will get to your phone calls.
[00:19:58.484 --> 00:19:59.405]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:01.727 --> 00:20:06.950]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:15.193]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:15.454 --> 00:20:22.497]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:22.677 --> 00:20:23.958]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[00:20:24.038 --> 00:20:29.942]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:35.225]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:20:35.345 --> 00:20:44.211]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:20:44.472 --> 00:20:47.774]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:20:52.896 --> 00:21:07.099]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.319 --> 00:21:13.140]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.081]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:16.121 --> 00:21:17.201]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.576 --> 00:21:23.159]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:31.364]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.365 --> 00:21:35.427]  Midas Resources is offering the Red Book and Silver Dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:36.328 --> 00:21:41.031]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[00:21:53.342 --> 00:21:53.742]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.782 --> 00:21:53.982]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.002 --> 00:21:55.564]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:55.624 --> 00:21:57.085]  Why did the first George Bush attack Iraq?
[00:21:57.105 --> 00:21:58.206]  Why did his son go into Iraq?
[00:22:10.277 --> 00:22:12.440]  Are we really fighting a war on terrorism?
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.122]  We'd like for you to know.

[00:22:31.019 --> 00:22:33.380]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:34.201 --> 00:22:37.043]  Have you been told why the world is more dangerous than ever?
[00:22:37.563 --> 00:22:43.066]  Communist China and Russia are arming, both supply, the military in South American countries.
[00:22:43.446 --> 00:22:49.210]  You can receive an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine by calling our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:57.491]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:59.491 --> 00:23:04.212]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.832 --> 00:23:13.774]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.214 --> 00:23:21.396]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:22.128 --> 00:23:27.629]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:56.157 --> 00:23:59.397]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:24:06.458 --> 00:24:14.160]  But just to finish my point up about the Texas Youth Commission, the private rape rooms for the state officials and others,
[00:24:16.815 --> 00:24:22.778]  Yeah, here's the article of the Dallas Morning News about Ricardo Luna, Rick Luna, with his son.
[00:24:22.798 --> 00:24:27.780]  It all started in 2001 for hitting a school hall monitor while being held in San Seba.
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:32.382]  Ricky Luna claims he was not only beaten by guards, but was also groped by a female staff member.
[00:24:32.422 --> 00:24:38.745]  And actually she grabbed him with him restrained and crushed his genitals, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:39.106 --> 00:24:40.126]  Just total torture.
[00:24:40.606 --> 00:24:44.228]  And I've seen the photos, not of that, but his body, just bloody wounds everywhere.
[00:24:45.842 --> 00:24:46.282]  I don't think so.
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:09.204]  Um, it says the first step was filing a lawsuit years ago, was dismissed.
[00:25:09.224 --> 00:25:13.888]  Since then, he says, getting anyone to believe their story has been difficult until their claims began to surface.
[00:25:14.248 --> 00:25:16.890]  Finally, finally, finally it came out, Ricardo Luna said.
[00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:19.552]  But again, this stuff is so prevalent.
[00:25:19.592 --> 00:25:24.276]  I'm at the TV station and there's Luna and I can't even remember what his case is until I get home.
[00:25:24.316 --> 00:25:27.079]  He was trying to give me his number and now I can't find his number.
[00:25:27.119 --> 00:25:27.739]  It's unlisted.
[00:25:27.779 --> 00:25:28.480]  We didn't save it.
[00:25:29.645 --> 00:25:32.368]  I know Mike really helped with this case five, six years ago.
[00:25:32.508 --> 00:25:35.471]  Mike Hanson, I forgot to call you yesterday.
[00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:36.612]  We do everything on air, I guess.
[00:25:36.672 --> 00:25:38.834]  Call us and dig out Rick Luna's number.
[00:25:38.854 --> 00:25:39.975]  I want to get him in studio.
[00:25:41.557 --> 00:25:42.998]  And they still got the sun, folks.
[00:25:43.719 --> 00:25:46.441]  Once you go in, you never get out, pretty much.
[00:25:47.623 --> 00:25:52.087]  And frankly, compared to the stack of news, I mean, I have a stack of it.
[00:25:52.927 --> 00:25:56.969]  We're talking about a large percentage of the girls get pregnant in there and it's kept quiet.
[00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.411]  I've got a big stack where they were hiring.
[00:25:59.431 --> 00:26:02.112]  A lot of these felons were convicted pedophiles.
[00:26:03.473 --> 00:26:10.797]  But by the time it hits the national news, they're covering, well, this one looked at porn and had a felony for armed robbery.
[00:26:13.578 --> 00:26:20.082]  Or they've arrested the head of the system for illegally increasing their sentences for no reason.
[00:26:20.718 --> 00:26:24.039]  Instead of going after the really serious issues.
[00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:45.145]  I mean, those others are pretty darn serious, but... And then we have federal and state prosecutors writing letters to the state police, to the Texas Rangers, saying, well, it didn't hurt these boys, and maybe they were consenting ten-year-old children to being raped by jail guards.
[00:26:45.205 --> 00:26:49.066]  I mean, that's the incredible thing that Dr. Corsi talked about.
[00:26:50.143 --> 00:27:00.310]  That's the amazing thing is that there's such a disconnect with the state and federal authorities that they think it's normal.
[00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:09.016]  It's like Gonzales writing memos saying they can torture people to death, and his designate, his deputy, John Hughes, saying they can torture small children, toddlers, with pliers.
[00:27:09.316 --> 00:27:09.977]  Sexually.
[00:27:10.677 --> 00:27:13.199]  I mean, you can't make stuff up like this.
[00:27:13.928 --> 00:27:16.289]  This is not an American Psycho Novel.
[00:27:16.629 --> 00:27:20.371]  This is not a late night movie on HBO, folks.
[00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:22.612]  This is America.
[00:27:23.412 --> 00:27:25.413]  Of course they were involved in 9-11.
[00:27:25.814 --> 00:27:28.235]  Of course they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:27:28.515 --> 00:27:31.676]  Of course they're grabbing little kids and testing pesticides on them until they die.
[00:27:32.056 --> 00:27:33.977]  That's who they are!
[00:27:34.197 --> 00:27:36.118]  Can't you understand it?
[00:27:36.498 --> 00:27:37.239]  I've been there!
[00:27:37.919 --> 00:27:42.681]  I've seen the families crying when their five-year-old's being taken for no reason.
[00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:47.943]  It all started when a neighbor saw the kid playing in the backyard and decided he was out there unattended.
[00:27:49.544 --> 00:27:55.066]  I've been there when the newborn baby's being snatched and the cops choking the woman to make her sign the baby over.
[00:27:56.987 --> 00:27:58.127]  I've seen hell!
[00:27:58.387 --> 00:27:59.388]  Do you understand?
[00:27:59.628 --> 00:28:05.070]  Believe me, they're evil, they're all over the place, and it takes a lot of courage to stand up against them.
[00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:14.386]  But with the Rick Lunas of the world, and the Mike Hansons of the world, and with the Alex Joneses of the world, we're going to beat these people.
[00:28:15.166 --> 00:28:23.070]  And I want to take this country back, because I want to put them on trial, in front of a jury of their peers, and I want to execute them.
[00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:26.932]  I want to see these people pay for what they've done.
[00:28:27.192 --> 00:28:34.035]  They need to go spend a few years in prison, thinking about what they've done, and then they need to swing from the end of a long rope.
[00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:39.520]  I am sick of these people.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.421]  I am tired of the stuff they do.
[00:28:41.721 --> 00:28:43.382]  I'm tired of how they get away with it.
[00:28:46.224 --> 00:28:47.065]  I'm tired of it!
[00:28:47.605 --> 00:28:58.651]  I have sat there and watched judges get off on it and feed on it and their eyes just crazed with Luciferian wickedness as families cry and beg as they steal children to hand them into this meat grinder.
[00:29:02.794 --> 00:29:06.456]  It makes me want to cry or it alternatively makes me want to just turn this desk over.
[00:29:07.412 --> 00:29:12.517]  Now see, I said I wasn't getting into the Iran war, but this is the war we're fighting right here at home.
[00:29:14.178 --> 00:29:19.282]  And Paul wrote a little blurb article on Corsi's interview Monday and put it up, and then I saw one of the message boards.
[00:29:19.603 --> 00:29:22.125]  Some guy was going, I don't see any proof in this article!
[00:29:22.145 --> 00:29:24.267]  I need to see proof!
[00:29:24.487 --> 00:29:26.549]  Hey, you lazy jackass!
[00:29:27.169 --> 00:29:32.654]  If you would have simply clicked on the hyperlinks, you would have found mainstream reports and documents and U.S.
[00:29:32.714 --> 00:29:33.475]  Attorney letters.
[00:29:34.691 --> 00:29:35.051]  Okay?
[00:29:35.572 --> 00:29:36.613]  But you're too lazy.
[00:29:36.833 --> 00:29:38.634]  You just deny everything out of hand.
[00:29:40.256 --> 00:29:42.217]  People like you need to have your teeth knocked out.
[00:29:42.257 --> 00:29:44.099]  That'll get you to pay a little more attention.
[00:29:44.619 --> 00:29:48.862]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.585 --> 00:29:52.525]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.986 --> 00:29:54.607]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.508 --> 00:29:58.210]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.613 --> 00:30:07.629]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:30:07.649 --> 00:30:09.735]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[00:30:15.316 --> 00:30:17.677]  The Poison of Globalism is Nationalism.

[00:31:11.736 --> 00:31:14.899]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:18.803]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[00:31:19.084 --> 00:31:27.032]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[00:31:33.999 --> 00:31:36.821]  Visit the website, twowitnessministries.com.
[00:31:37.082 --> 00:31:41.505]  King George II beats the war drums for his next invasion, Iran and Syria.
[00:31:41.846 --> 00:31:44.908]  More nations are to follow, including the draft of your children.

[00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:59.221]  Unless she repents, America will not survive the Red Horse of World War III.
[00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:01.650]  It's a fact.
[00:32:01.830 --> 00:32:06.272]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:32:06.592 --> 00:32:11.794]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[00:32:12.094 --> 00:32:15.295]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[00:32:15.535 --> 00:32:22.678]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[00:32:23.018 --> 00:32:30.181]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[00:32:30.441 --> 00:32:32.541]  This is not a debt consolidation company.

[00:32:49.485 --> 00:32:50.945]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:33.584]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young man lost her marbles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:33:35.387 --> 00:33:37.268]  But I am still alive.
[00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.151]  I was a sailor.
[00:33:44.032 --> 00:33:46.733]  I was born upon the tide.
[00:33:49.034 --> 00:33:53.397]  With the sea I did abide.
[00:33:53.617 --> 00:33:57.159]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.022]  I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow.
[00:34:05.533 --> 00:34:32.706]  And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed But I'm living still I was a dam builder Across a river deep and wide Where steel and water didn't collide A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado
[00:34:34.384 --> 00:34:34.945]  Welcome back.
[00:34:37.146 --> 00:34:43.851]  I know we got Mark, John, George, Richard, John, and many others holding.
[00:34:44.772 --> 00:34:48.915]  And I'm gonna get into the Iran news right now.
[00:34:50.276 --> 00:34:51.677]  And then take your calls.
[00:34:53.559 --> 00:34:55.340]  There is so much here.
[00:34:56.221 --> 00:35:01.765]  I don't really even, again, know where to start, but I'll do my best here.
[00:35:02.578 --> 00:35:04.439]  Russia intelligence sees U.S.
[00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:07.160]  military buildup on Iran border.
[00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:13.382]  This is out of the Novosti, or Novostat Russian News, the main government news.
[00:35:14.683 --> 00:35:21.925]  RIA Novosti, Russian military intelligence services are reporting a flurry of activity by U.S.
[00:35:22.025 --> 00:35:23.846]  armed forces near Iran's border.
[00:35:24.346 --> 00:35:28.668]  A high-ranking security source said yesterday
[00:35:29.705 --> 00:35:32.708]  The latest military intelligence data points to a heightened U.S.
[00:35:32.748 --> 00:35:44.898]  military preparations for both an air and ground operation against Iran, the official said, adding that the Pentagon has probably not yet made a final decision as to when an attack will be launched.
[00:35:45.898 --> 00:35:52.644]  He said the Pentagon is looking for a way to deliver a strike against Iran that would enable the Americans to bring the country to its knees at minimal cost.
[00:35:53.706 --> 00:35:54.587]  He also said the U.S.
[00:35:54.607 --> 00:36:04.793]  Naval presence in the Persian Gulf had, for the first time in the past four years, reached the level that existed shortly before the invasion of Iraq in March of 2003, four years ago.
[00:36:05.933 --> 00:36:11.677]  Colonel General Lenineed... I always pronounce this wrong.
[00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:23.961]  Ivanov, Vice President of the Academy of Geopolitical Sciences, said last week that the Pentagon is planning to deliver a massive airstrike on Iran's military infrastructure in the near future.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.260]  A U.S.
[00:36:25.721 --> 00:36:28.222]  Carrier Battle Group has been dispatched to the Gulf.
[00:36:28.622 --> 00:36:46.950]  The USS John C. Stennis, with a crew of 3,200 and around 80 fixed-wing aircraft, including F-18 Hornets and Super Hornet fighter-bombers, eight support ships and four nuclear submarines, are heading for the Gulf, where a similar group led by the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower has been deployed since December of 2006.
[00:36:48.453 --> 00:36:48.833]  The U.S.
[00:36:48.913 --> 00:36:52.935]  is also sending Patriot anti-missile systems to the region.
[00:36:53.596 --> 00:36:58.038]  Israel has openly said they may attack any day now in their papers.
[00:36:58.678 --> 00:37:05.501]  French, German, British, and other embassy staff are preparing for evacuation.
[00:37:05.541 --> 00:37:08.503]  That was in the Jerusalem Post over the weekend.
[00:37:10.876 --> 00:37:11.757]  That's one of the stories.
[00:37:11.797 --> 00:37:12.418]  Here's another one.
[00:37:12.458 --> 00:37:13.139]  Will U.S.
[00:37:13.339 --> 00:37:14.360]  attack Iran?
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.002]  Paul Watson wrote a great article yesterday.
[00:37:16.062 --> 00:37:17.363]  It's on the main page of presentplanet.com.
[00:37:17.383 --> 00:37:18.324]  You should go read it.
[00:37:18.344 --> 00:37:20.166]  It pretty much boils all this down.
[00:37:20.186 --> 00:37:22.869]  I really should just be reading that article, but I forgot to print it off.
[00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:27.735]  Maybe the guys can print off a story he wrote.
[00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:29.651]  U.S.
[00:37:29.751 --> 00:37:31.113]  will attack Iran.
[00:37:31.654 --> 00:37:33.456]  Russia has reported increased U.S.
[00:37:33.476 --> 00:37:38.763]  military activity in and around the strategic Gulf for the first time in four years since the 2003 invasion.
[00:37:39.144 --> 00:37:46.134]  The United Arab Emirates, UAE, has declared that its territories are off-limits to anyone for staging military or intelligence operations against Iran.
[00:37:46.906 --> 00:38:08.475]  In a week of ominous developments, the most serious being the Iranian seizure of 15 British Navy personnel near the Shat Al Arab waterway that divides Iran and Iraq, a statement by the UAE President reported that his country would not allow its territories for operations against Iran assumes high significance.
[00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.750]  U.S.
[00:38:10.830 --> 00:38:18.312]  U-2 spy planes and F-16s and other fighter jets will have been used by the UAE ever since 1990, the Gulf crisis over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
[00:38:18.612 --> 00:38:27.695]  Due to strategic locations and ports within the Gulf, as well as the Arabian Sea, the use of the UAE land and air waters would have been of immense value to any strike force.
[00:38:30.136 --> 00:38:30.896]  Actually, the U.S.
[00:38:30.936 --> 00:38:37.698]  has the use of bases in all the six Arab Gulf states for operations in Iraq, and to some extent also to support its
[00:38:39.153 --> 00:38:40.854]  Coalition troops in Afghanistan.
[00:38:42.936 --> 00:38:55.785]  And it goes on that the six states of Oman, UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have expressed unwillingness in the past for military engagement with their immediate Shia neighbor Iran.
[00:38:56.085 --> 00:39:01.489]  This is the first time that one of them, the UAE, has flatly denied its territories to the U.S.
[00:39:01.529 --> 00:39:03.991]  for military and intelligence operations against Iran.
[00:39:04.491 --> 00:39:06.052]  Let's just stop right there.
[00:39:07.213 --> 00:39:07.754]  Instead of
[00:39:10.199 --> 00:39:35.226]  Instead of going into all of the nuts and bolts of what's happening right now, maybe it's just better for me to look at the larger strategia of the New World Order gang and why the Anglo-American slash AIPAC crime syndicate is doing this.
[00:39:38.527 --> 00:39:41.349]  And anything the New World Order does is done for a host of reasons.
[00:39:41.409 --> 00:39:42.649]  Why did they carry out 9-11?
[00:39:45.130 --> 00:39:55.916]  To have hundreds of billions of no-bid weapons contracts, to use Iraq as a beachhead to project power into Iran and Syria and on into the rest of Central Asia eastward.
[00:39:57.777 --> 00:40:07.442]  It was about a domestic police state and a crackdown on the Bill of Rights and Constitutions of not just the United States, but Canada, England, Europe, Australia, New Zealand.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:12.661]  A pretext for a new dark age of oppression and surveillance and control.
[00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:23.083]  And so really the big prize, not just being the Middle East, that's secondary, is our domestic economies being in this wartime mode of relinquishing our liberties forever.
[00:40:25.103 --> 00:40:30.744]  And capturing the true targets, these once free and extremely wealthy nations.
[00:40:32.865 --> 00:40:34.165]  But just looking at Iran,
[00:40:37.739 --> 00:40:55.454]  The PNAC documents, the Israeli documents, the Pentagon documents, the P20G documents from Rumsfeld all state that in reality they plan to be in Iraq for the next hundred years, thirty conservatively, with massive permanent multi-thousand troop level bases all over the country, broken into three parts.
[00:40:56.468 --> 00:41:04.652]  Breaking Syria into three parts, breaking Iran into as many as six parts, and now you're hearing them announce us like it's some new idea.
[00:41:05.292 --> 00:41:07.313]  Oh, things didn't work, we'll break it in three parts.
[00:41:07.613 --> 00:41:10.435]  We told you again, a year before the war, that would be the plan.
[00:41:10.675 --> 00:41:15.797]  It wasn't hard, we read the official government documents, and then versus what they put on the nightly news for the general public.
[00:41:16.238 --> 00:41:16.878]  It's all stated.
[00:41:16.898 --> 00:41:21.120]  It's like I have a news report where they're going to use your driver's license to buy and sell.
[00:41:22.017 --> 00:41:23.758]  People are going, my gosh, how did you know?
[00:41:23.778 --> 00:41:25.139]  How did Alex predict it?
[00:41:25.439 --> 00:41:35.226]  That was in official Pentagon documents and official MIT documents and official big consortium meetings with the big IT and banking systems over the last ten years.
[00:41:35.286 --> 00:41:36.227]  It was openly stated.
[00:41:37.268 --> 00:41:39.990]  I saw Governor Ridge say it on C-SPAN, on top of it.
[00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:42.412]  I mean, I just, they do what they say!
[00:41:42.432 --> 00:41:44.433]  I mean, it's not hard here, folks, okay?
[00:41:44.773 --> 00:41:45.194]  Not hard!
[00:41:46.855 --> 00:41:47.895]  Again, I'm not that smart.
[00:41:48.076 --> 00:41:49.917]  I actually go read what they say they're going to do,
[00:41:50.802 --> 00:41:58.287]  And then I get up on air and freak out because I've got so much knowledge I can't even... I'm not good at it, I guess, putting it forward, but it's just... it's mind-blowing!
[00:41:59.008 --> 00:42:04.892]  Then I read some article attacking me yesterday saying I'm delusional and Lou Dobbs is delusional because there's no North American Union.
[00:42:05.713 --> 00:42:11.437]  No, just the CFR just wrote the law, wrote the agreement, and they say it's to get a North American Union publicly.
[00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:16.060]  I mean, you know... I'm already digressing, and I said I'd get to your calls.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:19.923]  It's just... It's all interconnected.
[00:42:23.317 --> 00:42:32.563]  But just looking at the Middle Eastern and Central Asian piece of this, they're exporting chaos, order out of chaos, order out of chaos.
[00:42:34.705 --> 00:42:49.034]  And when they attack Iran, if they attack Iran, which it's looking more and more likely they will, people are so amazed by the brazen, wanton hubris and chutzpah and aplomb and bravado.
[00:42:50.375 --> 00:42:51.936]  I mean, I don't have enough words to describe it.
[00:42:52.498 --> 00:42:54.701]  Just the out-of-control confidence.
[00:42:55.762 --> 00:42:58.405]  Because, see, they don't care if it looks bad.
[00:42:58.445 --> 00:43:00.147]  They don't care if it wakes people up.
[00:43:00.187 --> 00:43:02.210]  They don't care how obvious it is.
[00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:04.232]  They're moving into the final phase now.
[00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:10.360]  But people still can't believe they're going to attack Iran because they lied about WMDs.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:11.381]  They lied about Iraq.
[00:43:12.597 --> 00:43:14.498]  We have the White House memo, premeditatedly.
[00:43:14.718 --> 00:43:15.739]  They lied about everything.
[00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:17.100]  They've been caught in all these scandals.
[00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:18.961]  They're not going to attack Iran.
[00:43:18.981 --> 00:43:19.601]  They couldn't.
[00:43:19.662 --> 00:43:24.084]  I mean, the Israelis say they're four years from having a primitive atomic weapon.
[00:43:24.545 --> 00:43:26.306]  And the CIA says nine years.
[00:43:26.386 --> 00:43:29.968]  And the Bashir Reactor's construction's been suspended by Russia.
[00:43:30.548 --> 00:43:31.489]  And why?
[00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:33.010]  Why are they going to attack?
[00:43:33.650 --> 00:43:34.551]  What's the reason?
[00:43:34.571 --> 00:43:36.012]  I mean, how are they going to get away with it?
[00:43:39.281 --> 00:43:41.684]  Seventy-something percent of the American people are against it.
[00:43:42.004 --> 00:43:43.406]  Eighty-something percent of the British people.
[00:43:43.466 --> 00:43:43.786]  How?
[00:43:43.886 --> 00:43:44.247]  Why?
[00:43:45.008 --> 00:43:48.191]  Ninety-something percent of the French, but they're still sending the French aircraft carrier.
[00:43:51.515 --> 00:43:52.917]  They're one aircraft carrier.
[00:43:53.557 --> 00:43:53.978]  Why?
[00:43:53.998 --> 00:43:54.058]  Why?
[00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:54.919]  Why?
[00:43:54.939 --> 00:43:54.999]  Why?
[00:43:55.419 --> 00:43:55.820]  Why?
[00:43:59.361 --> 00:44:00.462]  It's order out of chaos.
[00:44:00.742 --> 00:44:03.303]  They're trying to start World War III.
[00:44:03.343 --> 00:44:04.343]  In fact, that'll be the headline.
[00:44:04.784 --> 00:44:09.066]  The neocons are trying to start World War III right now.
[00:44:09.646 --> 00:44:17.710]  Because they know when they attack the Shias that the Saudis are on the verge of toppling.
[00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:24.513]  They are on the razor's edge of having a total, true Islamic rebellion
[00:44:25.476 --> 00:44:27.577]  A jihad in their country.
[00:44:27.637 --> 00:44:34.140]  I mean, you don't think that the Saudi Arabians, tens of millions of them, watching 4,000 princes.
[00:44:35.141 --> 00:44:38.502]  I think the smallest allowance is like 20-something million a year or something.
[00:44:38.522 --> 00:44:39.683]  I've got to pull the numbers out for you.
[00:44:39.783 --> 00:44:40.763]  I think it's worse than that.
[00:44:42.244 --> 00:44:49.327]  With some of them worth tens of billions apiece, with giant... I mean, they have the actual harems, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:44:49.347 --> 00:44:51.408]  A lot of it with your kids grabbed by CPS.
[00:44:51.488 --> 00:44:51.868]  Literally.
[00:44:52.049 --> 00:44:52.829]  That's mainstream news.
[00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.892]  Right out of Florida, their main shopping ground.
[00:44:56.772 --> 00:45:09.918]  And can you imagine the Muslims sitting there watching that and seeing that going on and seeing the jets land with all the top European whores getting off, male and female, and watching all the neocons landing.
[00:45:10.218 --> 00:45:13.219]  And then I hear Limbaugh and other neocons saying, yeah, Saudi Arabia's next.
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.521]  See, I mean, these guys all stab each other in the back.
[00:45:18.141 --> 00:45:19.322]  And so they go into Iran.
[00:45:19.382 --> 00:45:21.603]  That will cause more rebellion in Iraq.
[00:45:22.495 --> 00:45:24.256]  That will cause more resistance in Iraq.
[00:45:24.276 --> 00:45:25.396]  It will cause a blow-up there.
[00:45:25.716 --> 00:45:27.097]  It will cause a blow-up in Iran.
[00:45:27.117 --> 00:45:28.897]  It will cause blow-ups all over the world.
[00:45:29.457 --> 00:45:32.578]  Iran will probably strike back.
[00:45:32.738 --> 00:45:34.579]  Everything they do will be called terrorism.
[00:45:34.599 --> 00:45:37.840]  It'll be like if somebody mugged you and you blocked their blow.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.660]  It'd be called assault.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.942]  It's like when cops are beating you with a belly club and if you block their blow.
[00:45:42.182 --> 00:45:43.402]  It'll be on surveillance tape.
[00:45:43.442 --> 00:45:48.984]  I've seen the cop car tapes, squad car videos where they're beating you and if you raise your arm, you're charged with assault.
[00:45:49.702 --> 00:45:50.962]  No, you've got to lay there and take it.
[00:45:51.522 --> 00:45:52.823]  Ball up in the fetal position.
[00:45:53.103 --> 00:45:59.184]  Well, if Iran raises a forearm to block the blows, it will be called ultimate terrorism.
[00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:05.285]  They're already talking about hitting Iran with nukes first, and then nuking them if they respond with bigger nukes.
[00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:11.226]  And folks, there's going to be American flags all over cars flapping, made in Chinese slave factories.
[00:46:11.726 --> 00:46:15.747]  There's going to be people running around drunk, screaming in the streets like there were at the last two wars.
[00:46:16.585 --> 00:46:19.390]  I've talked to liquor store and pizza place owners.
[00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.293]  It'll be... It's a party, folks!
[00:46:21.854 --> 00:46:31.549]  But the very people attacking Iran and trying to destabilize the whole region to widen the conflict and get us into a true World War III and a national draft situation...
[00:46:32.646 --> 00:46:40.534]  A situation where we start getting our behind kicked so that Americans will go, well we can't get beat, okay, even those that were against the war will catch themselves wanting to be for it.
[00:46:40.814 --> 00:46:45.218]  I'll even catch myself, we're losing, maybe the war, we've got to fight now!
[00:46:45.538 --> 00:46:47.640]  See, they understand that psychology.
[00:46:49.162 --> 00:46:54.687]  They understand that and they want to get you into that and have you go along with that.
[00:46:56.505 --> 00:47:03.467]  But the very people launching this Iran invasion, the very people that launched the attack on Iraq after 15 years, what was it at the time?
[00:47:05.027 --> 00:47:12.229]  It would have been 13 years of sanctions, now ongoing siege for almost 17 years.
[00:47:12.309 --> 00:47:14.930]  It started in late 1990 and so late 2007 it will be 17 years of hell.
[00:47:19.201 --> 00:47:21.161]  Three million less Iraqis than there were.
[00:47:21.422 --> 00:47:25.322]  By the way, not just the British Medical Journal, now the major U.S.
[00:47:25.362 --> 00:47:29.584]  Medical Journal has come out and said, yeah, it's above 600,000 dead Iraqis.
[00:47:31.624 --> 00:47:33.204]  By the way, Lancet is not political.
[00:47:33.905 --> 00:47:37.065]  And if they are, it leans towards pro-war.
[00:47:37.565 --> 00:47:39.646]  Well, now we've got another... Where is it?
[00:47:39.666 --> 00:47:40.486]  Let me just dig it out.
[00:47:41.786 --> 00:47:42.747]  I had it here in the stack.
[00:47:42.787 --> 00:47:46.808]  See, that's the... Where is it in my stack?
[00:47:46.928 --> 00:47:48.048]  Oh, I had it here in the new...
[00:47:48.669 --> 00:47:49.670]  I'll find it during a break.
[00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.772]  I know I said I'd get to your calls, and we're going to.
[00:47:53.674 --> 00:48:08.749]  But the very people launching this war are the very individuals who have introduced in the House, and you're busy looking at the war and Anna Nicole Smith and stuff like that, they've reintroduced, and it right now is racing out of committee, total blanket amnesty.
[00:48:09.369 --> 00:48:13.213]  When you call your congressmen or women, they say, it's not amnesty, no, it's a guest worker program.
[00:48:13.846 --> 00:48:15.168]  But it legalizes them all, right?
[00:48:15.208 --> 00:48:18.611]  Well, yes, it allows unlimited skilled workers and unskilled, right?
[00:48:18.651 --> 00:48:21.855]  Well, yeah, but... End of the country!
[00:48:22.455 --> 00:48:23.156]  End of the country!
[00:48:23.476 --> 00:48:34.348]  We are in the North American Union, the dollar's being devalued, and you go to the yuppie websites and we're being made fun of and they're saying there's no North American Union, no plan for it, ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:48:35.316 --> 00:48:39.878]  I mean, big news sites are literally with headlines saying, there is no North American Union.
[00:48:40.358 --> 00:48:41.279]  We are insane.
[00:48:41.859 --> 00:48:42.679]  We are crazy.
[00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:43.820]  We are liars.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.080]  We are evil.
[00:48:46.641 --> 00:48:47.482]  Let's go to the calls here.
[00:48:47.502 --> 00:48:48.342]  You've been holding long enough.
[00:48:48.622 --> 00:48:49.743]  Mark in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:48:49.783 --> 00:48:50.163]  Go ahead.
[00:48:51.483 --> 00:48:52.104]  Dear brother.
[00:48:52.564 --> 00:48:52.944]  Hi.
[00:48:54.925 --> 00:48:58.907]  First, let's remember, I understand you're rich.
[00:49:00.127 --> 00:49:03.169]  Personally, I want a millstone for these jokers that are, these
[00:49:04.514 --> 00:49:11.196]  It's better for you to throw yourself in the ocean with a giant weight around your neck the size of a boulder than to hurt an innocent child.
[00:49:33.592 --> 00:49:42.157]  I've tried to reason with some people when I tried to explain to them that what the media cartel has been saying is not an accurate reflection.
[00:49:42.477 --> 00:49:56.064]  And what they told me is, well, MPP and Reuters are saying the same thing, you know, apparently a twisted idea of let everything be established by two or three witnesses, and I'm trying to get across to them a thousand wires saying the same thing does not make it true.
[00:49:56.924 --> 00:49:59.846]  And the thing is, I tried to point that to, I believe it's
[00:50:00.188 --> 00:50:15.758]  You take the word Iran, and you switch around the last two letters, dot com, slash, E-N, and, you know, there's a, just, uh, I-R-N-A, dot com, you click on English, and then, then all those little squibbles that make no sense to us will disappear, and you'll see it in English.
[00:50:16.299 --> 00:50:25.545]  But I've inquired of them, I haven't gotten any feedback, but basically, um, what people are reporting versus what's actually, what he actually said are completely different things.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.642]  Yeah, Oppenheimer didn't say the things that we were told he said.
[00:50:30.022 --> 00:50:31.783]  And he didn't make Jews wear yellow stars.
[00:50:32.083 --> 00:50:33.744]  They didn't throw babies out of incubators.
[00:50:34.224 --> 00:50:36.085]  It's all lies and spin.
[00:50:36.605 --> 00:50:37.646]  Your phone's breaking up.
[00:50:37.666 --> 00:50:38.386]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:50:38.626 --> 00:50:39.366]  Thanks for calling.
[00:50:39.687 --> 00:50:43.348]  More calls straight ahead, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:50:56.725 --> 00:51:05.211]  It's here!
[00:51:05.391 --> 00:51:10.174]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.535 --> 00:51:18.160]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.863 --> 00:51:25.925]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.306 --> 00:51:37.729]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.049 --> 00:51:41.991]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.011 --> 00:51:43.911]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.272 --> 00:51:48.133]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:55:58.204 --> 00:55:59.784]  Hello, Alex.
[00:56:00.104 --> 00:56:01.425]  Hi.
[00:56:01.545 --> 00:56:06.407]  Man, after all that stuff, it kind of might be a little
[00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:09.291]  My statement would be about the war.
[00:56:09.731 --> 00:56:17.616]  Do you remember, just like four or five years ago, what day that the army crossed the Euphrates River?
[00:56:20.237 --> 00:56:21.277]  Particularly, sir?
[00:56:21.297 --> 00:56:27.761]  Yeah, the war started before April, but what day did they cross the Euphrates River?
[00:56:28.691 --> 00:56:32.173]  I know that the war started in mid-March.
[00:56:32.373 --> 00:56:36.815]  I know the anniversary was about a week and a half ago.
[00:56:36.895 --> 00:56:38.676]  What, was it around the 15th or so?
[00:56:39.916 --> 00:56:41.097]  It was April Fool's Day.
[00:56:42.077 --> 00:56:52.102]  That's when our army crossed the Euphrates River, and there's spirits that God has reserved for that time, and then that's what let them go.
[00:56:52.122 --> 00:56:54.723]  I'm a little confused by that.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:59.581]  You know, that's a big difference in philosophy.
[00:56:59.641 --> 00:57:03.423]  I'm not totally disagreeing with you, but it's up to us to do the right thing.
[00:57:03.443 --> 00:57:08.506]  We control our destinies to a great extent, and if we do the right thing, God will bless us.
[00:57:26.195 --> 00:57:33.577]  But, you know, it's because the American people became evil and decadent and let even more wicked people take control of us that we were used for this fraud.
[00:57:33.597 --> 00:57:37.097]  And then I hear people say about the war or about all the things that are happening.
[00:57:37.137 --> 00:57:38.678]  Well, it's all in God's plan.
[00:57:39.118 --> 00:57:43.359]  You know, I can't get out and fight for the children being kidnapped by CPS for rape rooms.
[00:57:43.779 --> 00:57:46.439]  You know, I can't, I can't... Go ahead.
[00:57:46.619 --> 00:57:49.900]  To the church is to visit the fatherless and the widows.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:54.321]  If they were doing their job, then there wouldn't be all this suffering that you see.
[00:57:55.191 --> 00:57:58.055]  I mean, you really tore me up inside, all that stuff you're saying.
[00:57:58.075 --> 00:57:59.396]  Well, I mean, take Nineveh.
[00:57:59.456 --> 00:58:00.117]  That part of it.
[00:58:00.277 --> 00:58:01.639]  I mean, take Nineveh.
[00:58:02.019 --> 00:58:06.784]  You know, Jonas went to Nineveh and it got a hundred year reprieve.
[00:58:07.605 --> 00:58:10.689]  I mean, God is in control, but God gives us free will.
[00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.530]  Amen.
[00:58:11.690 --> 00:58:14.393]  And that's the point I'm trying to make is what's happening is...
[00:58:15.464 --> 00:58:22.888]  I'm not saying it's God's plan, you know, to be a little... I don't want to be a little what you think, because I know you're in a temporal... You keep us grounded, okay?
[00:58:22.948 --> 00:58:24.749]  Oh, listen, I'm not your preacher, man.
[00:58:24.769 --> 00:58:25.830]  I'm just... You're there, man.
[00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:26.831]  You're there.
[00:58:26.851 --> 00:58:29.212]  I'm going to let you finish your point on the other side, okay?
[00:58:30.292 --> 00:58:30.973]  Well, I'm somewhere.
[00:58:31.013 --> 00:58:32.734]  I don't think I'm in the temple, folks.
[00:58:32.794 --> 00:58:35.215]  I'm not a perfect person, let me tell you.
[00:58:35.736 --> 00:58:37.537]  Alright, we'll be right back in 70 seconds.
[00:58:41.306 --> 00:58:45.893]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.492 --> 00:58:58.132]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.793 --> 00:58:59.833]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.554 --> 00:59:01.694]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.335 --> 00:59:03.155]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.896 --> 00:59:04.796]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.816 --> 00:59:09.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.639 --> 00:59:13.761]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.002 --> 00:59:17.043]  Alright, we're now into hour number two.
[00:59:17.083 --> 00:59:19.844]  We're talking about the build-up to the attack on Iran.
[00:59:21.145 --> 00:59:22.906]  The soldiers being sieged.
[00:59:24.176 --> 00:59:25.777]  Looks like a war provocation.
[00:59:25.877 --> 00:59:33.362]  We said the war would probably start off all the carrier groups and the troops being right up against Iranian waters looking for a provocation.
[00:59:33.382 --> 00:59:34.443]  That's how they always do it.
[00:59:36.344 --> 00:59:39.927]  And I would look for a carrier to get hit by a cruise missile, anything.
[00:59:40.607 --> 00:59:43.649]  I mean, believe me, all those aircraft carriers aren't there for nothing.
[00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:47.912]  Every time they put this type of firepower into a theater, they've used it.
[00:59:49.597 --> 00:59:57.063]  Now, I'm hoping that's not the case, but it ties into the dollar, it ties into the price of gold, it ties into your housing prices, the stock market, it affects so many things.
[00:59:57.383 --> 01:00:01.747]  We're taking your calls right now, and I guess we're talking to John in Oklahoma, and then we'll go to Gregory and others.
[01:00:01.787 --> 01:00:03.008]  Go ahead, John, finish up your point.
[01:00:03.648 --> 01:00:08.992]  Well, I just wanted to make it clear that I'm not trying to be, you know, religious zealot or anything.
[01:00:09.012 --> 01:00:12.095]  This is just my spiritual fact for your show tonight.
[01:00:12.115 --> 01:00:12.195]  Sure.
[01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:14.437]  Well, you don't have to apologize for your free speech.
[01:00:14.477 --> 01:00:18.560]  No, well, it's sympathetics, you know, because there may be people out there that are confused
[01:00:19.011 --> 01:00:20.392]  We don't have to be afraid, Alex.
[01:00:20.772 --> 01:00:24.874]  I mean, when you started out, you started, we better be afraid, you know, be afraid of this.
[01:00:25.354 --> 01:00:29.416]  What he says is trust in him and fear him because he can kill your soul.
[01:00:29.436 --> 01:00:34.458]  The only thing that there's any power to do is take our life.
[01:00:34.558 --> 01:00:37.499]  And I know that's a harsh statement for now, but that's reality.
[01:00:37.599 --> 01:00:37.920]  Okay.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.982]  What we need to focus on is focus on where he needs us to be.
[01:00:43.062 --> 01:00:47.764]  And that's just every day, wherever you can be to do the weak person, you know, stand up for the guy.
[01:00:48.260 --> 01:00:53.965]  You know, if you're in jail or wherever you're at, if you stand up for the right thing at every moment, that's where it's at.
[01:00:53.985 --> 01:00:56.006]  Sure, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:00:56.507 --> 01:00:58.108]  Let me be clear about what you just said.
[01:00:58.388 --> 01:00:59.049]  And thank you for the call.
[01:01:00.009 --> 01:01:06.174]  John, I was talking about a newspaper article calling me a professional fear monger.
[01:01:07.475 --> 01:01:14.521]  And I said, yes, I am trying to get people concerned and motivated and we should be afraid of the government being totally evil.
[01:01:15.385 --> 01:01:19.026]  We should be afraid of all the bad things that are happening.
[01:01:19.086 --> 01:01:22.306]  And I guess afraid to me is a different type of word.
[01:01:24.227 --> 01:01:28.147]  I don't mean you should be sitting there in the corner shivering in fear with your knees knocking.
[01:01:28.948 --> 01:01:30.188]  I mean you should be concerned.
[01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:41.890]  I mean look, when I'm hooking up a washing machine or a dryer that's gas powered, I try to seal that gas line, you know, with that special tape you put on it right.
[01:01:43.477 --> 01:01:46.680]  I don't just go, I got faith in God, I'm not even going to hook this up right.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.542]  God, if he loves me, will keep this gas from leaking.
[01:01:51.803 --> 01:01:54.225]  Now it's not that I'm a person who lives in fear and I'm afraid.
[01:01:54.946 --> 01:02:00.850]  It's that I have respect for dangerous things and I'm trying to be preparatory as best I can.
[01:02:01.851 --> 01:02:08.056]  I try to drive, you know, not fancy cars, but nicer cars because they have better steel cages.
[01:02:09.196 --> 01:02:18.904]  Not because I'm afraid to get on the highway, but because I want to make every preparation I can to avoid the dangers of life so I can go on to do important things.
[01:02:19.385 --> 01:02:28.152]  Now when it comes to fighting evil, I'm fearless because I've made the decision that's the right thing to do and I know that I don't need to let my mind be seized by fear.
[01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:34.578]  It's more disgust and shock at the New World Order and a type of nausea
[01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:44.032]  When I look at these people, it's kind of like I'd be afraid to jump into a pile of dead horses or something and roll around in them.
[01:02:44.532 --> 01:02:45.833]  I mean, it's just disgusting.
[01:02:47.934 --> 01:02:51.055]  And, you know, I am upset about what's happening to the dollar.
[01:02:51.415 --> 01:02:53.156]  I am upset about what's happening to the economy.
[01:02:53.736 --> 01:02:56.837]  I'm upset about some of the general public being totally unaware of it.
[01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:07.600]  So when I say you better be afraid, I mean you better be concerned and you better be aware of the threats and the dangers and then take actions to resist it.
[01:03:08.401 --> 01:03:09.782]  Obviously I'm not afraid enough.
[01:03:10.202 --> 01:03:14.526]  I've got a little bit of money and two bank accounts and my children's names for college or whatever later.
[01:03:15.266 --> 01:03:16.067]  That's my savings.
[01:03:16.908 --> 01:03:24.754]  And I've known the economy's going to plunge and I've known the dollar's in trouble for several years and I haven't had the time or energy to try to put that money somewhere else or do something with it.
[01:03:25.755 --> 01:03:26.996]  So obviously I'm not that afraid.
[01:03:28.288 --> 01:03:30.049]  I'm saying we should be more concerned.
[01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:31.789]  We should be preparing.
[01:03:31.949 --> 01:03:32.970]  I should be preparing more.
[01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:36.070]  At every level.
[01:03:37.471 --> 01:03:38.271]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:42.372]  Alright, we're going to come back and go to Gregory, Richard, John, Nick.
[01:03:42.412 --> 01:03:44.093]  I'm going to try to accelerate through your calls.
[01:03:44.113 --> 01:03:46.954]  And I've got a bunch of other news too.
[01:03:47.014 --> 01:03:48.274]  It's just a lot of amazing stuff.
[01:03:48.294 --> 01:03:49.315]  We're talking about Iran.
[01:03:49.775 --> 01:03:50.155]  Stay with us.
[01:03:56.212 --> 01:04:01.679]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:09.650]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.362 --> 01:04:17.424]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.824 --> 01:04:29.248]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.568 --> 01:04:33.229]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.489 --> 01:04:35.450]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:39.631]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:02.903 --> 01:05:05.384]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.764 --> 01:05:20.332]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.372 --> 01:05:20.672]  government.
[01:05:20.852 --> 01:05:22.673]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.033 --> 01:05:28.957]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.097 --> 01:05:33.580]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:57.344 --> 01:06:01.306]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:06:01.566 --> 01:06:07.869]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.

[01:06:56.629 --> 01:06:59.532]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.572 --> 01:07:05.138]  Alright, we're talking about Iran.
[01:07:06.312 --> 01:07:08.914]  There can be no doubt they're preparing a giant military strike.
[01:07:08.994 --> 01:07:10.896]  Israel's openly saying they may hit first.
[01:07:11.877 --> 01:07:14.719]  If Iran responds in any way, it's going to be called terrorism.
[01:07:15.539 --> 01:07:16.360]  Defending themselves.
[01:07:16.981 --> 01:07:20.603]  And don't call the show saying, you're defending them Iraners!
[01:07:21.324 --> 01:07:21.824]  Traitor!
[01:07:22.965 --> 01:07:30.031]  Our government, our criminal government, that is not our government, overthrew their government in 53 and killed their entire cabinet.
[01:07:30.851 --> 01:07:31.692]  Cut their heads off.
[01:07:32.492 --> 01:07:36.214]  Staged terror attacks, and blamed it on their government, and took the government over, declassified.
[01:07:36.614 --> 01:07:44.917]  Then they put in the Shah, who until 79, tortured over 200,000 people to death, took people's property, people's wives, it was a reign of hell.
[01:07:47.178 --> 01:07:55.462]  And then they had the Islamo revolution over there, which was very suspicious, flown out of Paris, looks like another event, because they knew there was already rebellion going.
[01:07:56.842 --> 01:07:57.763]  And today,
[01:07:59.716 --> 01:08:04.400]  It's very suspect that Ahmadinejad is grabbing these troops, whether they were in his waters or not.
[01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:08.823]  But see, he, all the analysts say, and it gets stronger if he gets attacked.
[01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:15.989]  It actually shores up his regime and then spreads revolution all over the region.
[01:08:16.369 --> 01:08:20.212]  But see, the Iranians need to understand that globalists want that.
[01:08:20.392 --> 01:08:22.894]  You're being sucked in, just like the Japanese were sucked in.
[01:08:24.006 --> 01:08:26.428]  The Globalists are just too sophisticated for these people, folks.
[01:08:27.029 --> 01:08:28.430]  It's very sophisticated.
[01:08:29.011 --> 01:08:34.315]  And I don't want to sit here and toot the horn of the West, but it does seem that the Western mind is so subtle.
[01:08:34.915 --> 01:08:36.717]  Wheels within wheels within wheels.
[01:08:37.538 --> 01:08:47.306]  The Oriental mind, the Eastern mind, is certainly very subtle and mischievous as well, but I marvel at how often the Eastern mind is sucked in by the Western.
[01:08:49.648 --> 01:08:53.871]  Then one could argue that it is an Oriental mind that's doing all of this, Israel.
[01:08:54.572 --> 01:09:00.677]  But then there's a big argument about, is that the East and West meeting a hybrid of the Western and the Oriental?
[01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:03.239]  Which if you actually study anthropology, it is.
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:07.222]  So the Twain meet there, don't they?
[01:09:08.884 --> 01:09:09.924]  One of the places they meet.
[01:09:12.246 --> 01:09:16.049]  But it just gets from bad to worse.
[01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:18.531]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gregory in Washington.
[01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:19.112]  You're on the air.
[01:09:20.222 --> 01:09:20.482]  Hello?
[01:09:20.862 --> 01:09:21.122]  Yes!
[01:09:21.863 --> 01:09:29.906]  Okay, yeah, I wanted to call in about these school IDs I've been hearing about from Emily, I think she was saying, or someone was calling about the IDs.
[01:09:30.547 --> 01:09:36.950]  I'm from Chicago originally, and we had school IDs back in about 1994 at Bloom Trail High School.
[01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:42.192]  You had to wear them around your neck on a little lanyard, and you couldn't get into the school without them.
[01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:51.779]  And they've got all these excuses and all these good-sounding reasons, but it's all about training you how to be a prisoner, and the asylum is run by the inmates.
[01:09:52.499 --> 01:09:53.300]  Right, exactly.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:58.664]  You know, they said they were to keep out the drug dealers and the gangbangers, but they were in the school fighting every day.
[01:09:59.165 --> 01:10:00.806]  But, you know, that's at that point.
[01:10:01.106 --> 01:10:05.670]  And I wanted to tell you, I got hit you by watching Winnip on Shoutcast.
[01:10:06.551 --> 01:10:07.311]  Yes.
[01:10:07.331 --> 01:10:09.513]  I saw a couple of your videos on Shoutcast.
[01:10:10.111 --> 01:10:13.133]  And, uh, I immediately, I went out and checked out everything that you got.
[01:10:13.534 --> 01:10:20.279]  I bought, uh, your DVD, Terror Storm, uh, with the package deal with the, uh, America's Freedom from Fascism.
[01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:22.941]  One Saturday, I took a stack of DVDs.
[01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:30.307]  I just went out to Walmart, bought a stack of DVDs, burned them all, and took them to the library and handed them out to everybody that was in sight.
[01:10:30.847 --> 01:10:32.168]  I put the stickers on my car.
[01:10:32.308 --> 01:10:35.751]  It's that type of action, Gregory, that's going to bring these criminals to their knees.
[01:10:36.351 --> 01:10:36.872]  Well, thank you.
[01:10:37.292 --> 01:10:39.814]  And, uh, also, uh,
[01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:42.151]  Yeah, that's about it, I guess.
[01:10:42.992 --> 01:10:43.693]  Now, I interrupted you.
[01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:44.333]  What were you going to say?
[01:10:45.474 --> 01:10:45.814]  What's that?
[01:10:46.695 --> 01:10:49.597]  I interrupted you with the to their knees comment.
[01:10:49.637 --> 01:10:50.518]  You were going to say something else.
[01:10:51.598 --> 01:10:52.599]  Oh, no, that's it.
[01:10:52.659 --> 01:10:56.762]  Now, the last guy who was talking about, you know, how it's God's will.
[01:10:56.782 --> 01:11:05.349]  One of the things I can suggest to your listeners if they want any kind of like insight or, you know, religious insight, there's a guy named David Asherick.
[01:11:06.293 --> 01:11:09.735]  I watch a lot of his videos and a lot of his seminars that he puts on.
[01:11:09.755 --> 01:11:12.656]  He talks about Bible prophecy and things like that.
[01:11:12.676 --> 01:11:15.097]  So they can check him out.
[01:11:15.157 --> 01:11:16.078]  Google him.
[01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.658]  He's on Hope Media Ministry.
[01:11:18.439 --> 01:11:19.199]  David Asher.
[01:11:19.479 --> 01:11:21.440]  He has some good stuff.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.621]  What does he talk about?
[01:11:23.661 --> 01:11:33.526]  He talks about prophecy of the last days and things that are happening and how everybody is getting freaked out and basically showing people God's plan.
[01:11:35.263 --> 01:11:35.823]  Absolutely.
[01:11:35.883 --> 01:11:37.163]  I appreciate your call, Gregory.
[01:11:37.183 --> 01:11:38.124]  Good to have you on board.
[01:11:38.344 --> 01:11:40.184]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Texas.
[01:11:40.244 --> 01:11:40.964]  Richard, go ahead.
[01:11:40.984 --> 01:11:42.485]  Hey, Alex.
[01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:49.186]  I just wanted to empathize with you about how difficult it must be to try to figure out which issues to focus on every day.
[01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:50.826]  There's so much garbage going on.
[01:11:51.687 --> 01:11:52.647]  And just a quick comment.
[01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:57.808]  Last night on the Keith Olbermann Show, which is getting more interesting all the time on MSNBC,
[01:11:59.029 --> 01:11:59.890]  There were two things.
[01:12:00.091 --> 01:12:14.451]  One, they allowed Pat Tillman's mother to really shout off against the most recent hearing that she'd been granted with the military about the ongoing lies that she just blasted them on with regard to her son's death.
[01:12:15.077 --> 01:12:22.224]  And then more interesting even maybe was Bill Mayer that they had on last night, and I don't know if you heard about this, but they gave him a full minute.
[01:12:22.625 --> 01:12:37.459]  Oberman asked him what two questions he'd like to put to Bush, and the last one he spent a full minute saying that he'd really like to know how Bush could have sat there for a full seven minutes in the elementary school as he was told that the 9-11 attacks were going on.
[01:12:40.201 --> 01:12:43.923]  Yeah, 9-11 Truth is really starting to happen.
[01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:50.365]  I heard about that clip and strangely enough I was here at the office when MSNBC was on in the background and I saw him live on there.
[01:12:50.705 --> 01:12:54.046]  I think we were even recording when that happened last night.
[01:12:54.066 --> 01:12:59.868]  We need to find that clip and play it, but we should do an article on that because that is him inching towards 9-11 Truth.
[01:13:01.108 --> 01:13:06.413]  We now have Dennis Kucinich, the congressman, inching towards going public on 9-11, making some statements.
[01:13:06.954 --> 01:13:09.536]  I mean, the dam is breaking with Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:13:09.556 --> 01:13:12.078]  And again, folks, I'm no fan of her and her gun control and all that.
[01:13:12.418 --> 01:13:15.882]  The point is, if she breaks the dam on 9-11 truth, so be it.
[01:13:15.982 --> 01:13:17.103]  We're getting very close here.
[01:13:17.123 --> 01:13:24.870]  Yeah, I think Mayor looks like he's poised to take the next step, and perhaps Oberman will even follow, at least beginning to question the story.
[01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:25.931]  He's certainly getting the input.
[01:13:27.048 --> 01:13:28.368]  Well, they all know, believe me.
[01:13:28.408 --> 01:13:31.449]  They all know behind the scenes, and they're very, very close to going public.
[01:13:31.889 --> 01:13:47.472]  And we need to push this out public now, because if we wait until 2008, they're just going to double-team us and change horses there on the Pony Express, and put in a new straw dog, and then it'll take us years to wake the public up that that Democrat's evil as well.
[01:13:47.792 --> 01:13:54.993]  We need to blow out both parties right now, expose them as Global Crime Syndicate employees, and bring down the whole criminal syndicate right now.
[01:13:55.578 --> 01:13:59.679]  I put 9-11 inside job bumper stickers that you sent me on people's windshields.
[01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:01.440]  Good job, my friend.
[01:14:01.460 --> 01:14:02.500]  Good to hear from you, Richard.
[01:14:02.981 --> 01:14:04.501]  Let's talk to John in Michigan.
[01:14:04.521 --> 01:14:05.461]  You're on the air, John.
[01:14:05.481 --> 01:14:08.222]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:14:08.302 --> 01:14:08.903]  Appreciate it.
[01:14:08.923 --> 01:14:09.683]  Thank you for calling.
[01:14:10.223 --> 01:14:10.703]  No problem.
[01:14:11.804 --> 01:14:13.824]  You know, topics are all over the board here.
[01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:21.987]  My topic, I've been trying to get a hold of you, is on Michigan here, we've got the optical scan voting machines where there's optional
[01:14:22.557 --> 01:14:24.340]  Paper trail, uh, tracking there.
[01:14:24.361 --> 01:14:29.090]  I know most states, 37 states I believe, don't have optical, they're electric voting ballots.
[01:14:29.811 --> 01:14:33.318]  And, uh, I want to know what's the difference between the two in a sense of, uh,
[01:14:33.931 --> 01:14:35.152]  Of the scanning and cheating.
[01:14:35.192 --> 01:14:49.504]  I know it's easier on the electrical system than it is the optical scan, but I want to... Listen, you brought up a very important point, but first, because I've noticed the callers aren't doing what I ask, and that's okay, because you bring up important issues, but what do you think about the build-up to war with Iran?
[01:14:49.584 --> 01:14:55.369]  What do you think the financial fallout will be, and do you agree that it's going to widen into a larger conflict?
[01:14:56.410 --> 01:15:01.714]  Well, in my opinion, we're moving into World War III with that, I mean,
[01:15:02.148 --> 01:15:05.769]  You got other countries and... Yeah, and we're just calmly here talking about it.
[01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:08.090]  Oh, um, what are we having for lunch today?
[01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.850]  I mean, me too.
[01:15:09.331 --> 01:15:11.731]  I've been just slowly conditioned that this is going to happen.
[01:15:11.751 --> 01:15:13.392]  It's a far gone conclusion.
[01:15:14.272 --> 01:15:16.073]  Attack a country for absolutely no reason.
[01:15:17.153 --> 01:15:17.794]  It's just amazing.
[01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:20.515]  I mean, we're out murdering countries worldwide.
[01:15:20.915 --> 01:15:27.357]  And then you got, I mean, I got family members that, you know, work for GM Ford and they only get their news media from
[01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:29.812]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:15:29.832 --> 01:15:33.335]  Let me try to go back and comment on what you said just a few minutes ago.
[01:15:33.395 --> 01:15:35.237]  Let me try to break that down.
[01:15:50.712 --> 01:16:00.261]  There are five big companies, but there are three of them that make up the majority of the voting machine systems that have been sold across the nation.
[01:16:01.703 --> 01:16:08.489]  For the last 25 years plus, there have been optical scans for those that were in college or high school in the last 20 years.
[01:16:08.509 --> 01:16:15.616]  You know, it's the Scantron readers, the bubble sheets, the multiple choice where you fill in the bubbles with your number two pencil.
[01:16:18.298 --> 01:16:27.163]  The Feds started having federal grants to put these in, really 30 plus years ago, but they got widely adopted in the last quarter century, since the mid-1980s.
[01:16:30.185 --> 01:16:39.570]  And they've adopted these systems, and they're then fed through computers onto a computer system that then tabulates it onto a tape as a record.
[01:16:40.571 --> 01:16:47.695]  And you can rig the individual machine to steal the election, and it's easy to do.
[01:16:48.732 --> 01:16:59.454]  But then, citizens or candidates can demand a recount, and they have pulled those Scantron ballots, and had them rerun.
[01:17:00.715 --> 01:17:11.677]  And the problem is, the same county clerk, or the same state head of elections, depending on whether it's local or statewide, will run it through the same machines again and give you the same answer.
[01:17:12.808 --> 01:17:22.143]  But there have been cases where people have gone to court and gotten that blocked and gotten a hold of the ballots and had them redone and it was complete opposite of what people heard in the election and elections have been reversed.
[01:17:22.544 --> 01:17:24.968]  So those are filled with fraud but it's not
[01:17:26.136 --> 01:17:35.242]  There's at least some record of it, and if you want to pay the money for the recounts and jump through the hoops and get past the state election boards who are always involved in the fraud, I mean, we've dealt with this.
[01:17:35.282 --> 01:17:41.066]  We've had the county clerk in Austin caught double-counting ballot boxes, stuffing ballot boxes, breaking safety shields.
[01:17:41.086 --> 01:17:41.747]  That was in the paper.
[01:17:42.207 --> 01:17:43.568]  But the state said it was an accident.
[01:17:43.608 --> 01:17:47.350]  She falsified signatures and broke safety shields and did all this on accident in 1998.
[01:17:50.268 --> 01:18:02.956]  So, with the new systems, where it's all computerized and wireless modems, it makes it much easier to steal elections, it makes it much more centralized, and there's no paper record, there's no way to ever prove it was a fraud.
[01:18:04.516 --> 01:18:10.260]  Except that different engineers in the companies went public and said, I was hired to design it for fraud, it is a fraud.
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.443]  I mean, these people have testified before legislatures, but it's never in the national news, it's been in local news.
[01:18:16.163 --> 01:18:18.805]  It's come out that Ohio was stolen in 2004, clearly,
[01:18:19.851 --> 01:18:21.052]  New Mexico was stolen.
[01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:28.715]  Even news executives have leaked the exact election results nationwide two days before.
[01:18:28.735 --> 01:18:30.596]  You know, that happened in 98.
[01:18:32.997 --> 01:18:35.998]  So, pretty much there aren't elections.
[01:18:36.538 --> 01:18:38.419]  That's why government's so arrogant right now.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:41.941]  There's pockets of free elections still, but you have no way of verifying that.
[01:18:42.241 --> 01:18:44.962]  But predominantly, there are not elections in this country.
[01:18:45.182 --> 01:18:46.483]  The country is gone, folks.
[01:18:54.884 --> 01:19:06.153]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.

[01:19:59.958 --> 01:20:04.781]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:04.982 --> 01:20:07.744]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:07.784 --> 01:20:08.884]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:10.225 --> 01:20:14.828]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:23.014]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[01:20:56.663 --> 01:20:59.486]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:20:59.866 --> 01:21:02.628]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:09.915]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:21:54.133 --> 01:21:58.156]  Hi, I'm Joyce Riley and many of you know that for years I was a cardiovascular heart transplant nurse.
[01:21:58.517 --> 01:22:01.479]  Since that time I've educated myself on the importance of preventative care.
[01:22:01.879 --> 01:22:05.742]  It all begins with providing your heart and vascular system with building blocks for good health.
[01:22:06.183 --> 01:22:10.206]  Stroud's Heart Drops is the original formula that was copied by others but never duplicated.
[01:22:10.848 --> 01:22:15.331]  Strauss Heart Drops were developed by a master herbalist, Jim Strauss, after he suffered a heart attack in 1979.
[01:22:16.412 --> 01:22:19.193]  His doctor said he would only survive if he had heart bypass surgery.
[01:22:19.213 --> 01:22:20.374]  Then Jim said no.
[01:22:20.854 --> 01:22:25.157]  He developed Strauss Heart Drops, the formula that has been copied by others, but never been surpassed.
[01:22:25.598 --> 01:22:28.099]  Get the original Strauss Heart Drops, 4-ounce bottle for only $79.99.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:34.904]  Call the Power Hour at 877-817-9829.
[01:22:34.924 --> 01:22:35.624]  877-817-9829.
[01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.587]  You've probably heard about the other products that have tried to copy the Strauss formula?
[01:22:39.848 --> 01:22:42.069]  Well, get the original Strauss Heart Drops by calling 877-817-9829.
[01:22:42.089 --> 01:22:42.369]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:22:42.389 --> 01:22:45.131]  Now you can really do your heart right with Strauss Heart Drops.
[01:22:53.759 --> 01:22:56.700]  Federal agents!
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:57.640]  We are armed!
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:23:02.621]  What would you do if you knew all of the things we know?
[01:23:02.681 --> 01:23:03.861]  Would you stand up?
[01:23:03.921 --> 01:23:04.501]  Would you?
[01:23:04.561 --> 01:23:06.262]  Would you turn away too?
[01:23:06.702 --> 01:23:11.703]  And what if you saw all of the things that's wrong?
[01:23:11.743 --> 01:23:13.863]  Would you stand tall and strong?
[01:23:14.463 --> 01:23:17.004]  Or would you turn and walk away?
[01:23:17.024 --> 01:23:21.425]  What would you do if you knew all of the things we know?
[01:23:27.369 --> 01:23:30.331]  I got a message from the government like every day.
[01:23:31.531 --> 01:23:34.113]  I watch and look and call them all suckers.
[01:23:34.573 --> 01:23:36.555]  They're warning me about Osama over there.
[01:23:36.575 --> 01:23:39.817]  I see a message from the government like every day.
[01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:42.599]  I watch it and listen and call them all suckers.
[01:23:42.919 --> 01:23:44.980]  They wanted me about Osama or whatever.
[01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:46.882]  Picture me buying this scam.
[01:23:46.942 --> 01:23:47.682]  I said, never.
[01:23:48.162 --> 01:23:50.604]  You in tune to a hard truth, so just spit.
[01:23:50.804 --> 01:23:53.226]  I say commit it, give it, because I lose commission.
[01:23:53.446 --> 01:23:55.967]  It's all a part of fighting devil's state mind control.
[01:23:56.067 --> 01:23:58.429]  And all about the battle for your body, mind, and soul.
[01:23:58.509 --> 01:24:01.371]  And now I'm hoping you don't close your mind so they shape you.
[01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:03.712]  Don't forget they made us slaves, gave us AIDS, and raped us.
[01:24:03.892 --> 01:24:06.313]  Another push season mean another war for profit.
[01:24:06.594 --> 01:24:09.115]  All is secret so the public never think to stop it.
[01:24:09.135 --> 01:24:11.516]  The Illuminati, triple six, all connected.
[01:24:11.736 --> 01:24:14.138]  So the folks they control the race and take elections.
[01:24:14.298 --> 01:24:16.979]  It's the skull and bones, remakes and kill committee.
[01:24:16.999 --> 01:24:19.360]  See the dragon get eaten in every city.
[01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.822]  What would you do if you knew all the things we do?
[01:24:21.862 --> 01:24:22.542]  Would you stand up?
[01:24:31.601 --> 01:24:32.924]  Alright, I said I'd get to your calls.
[01:24:32.945 --> 01:24:34.268]  This song's just so good.
[01:24:34.710 --> 01:24:36.254]  Says it all in four minutes.
[01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:38.761]  Let's hear one more verse.
[01:24:40.283 --> 01:24:40.683]  Alright.
[01:24:40.723 --> 01:24:41.644]  We're gonna go to, uh...
[01:25:09.216 --> 01:25:11.977]  Nick and Tom and David and Chris and Bob and everybody.
[01:25:12.697 --> 01:25:19.039]  I've got to get to this clip that I didn't get to yesterday with the use your driver's license to purchase gas.
[01:25:20.279 --> 01:25:26.520]  And then remember there was a story four or five months ago about, oh, people are accidentally using their driver's license to buy.
[01:25:26.561 --> 01:25:27.481]  It's a scam.
[01:25:27.981 --> 01:25:29.381]  And it was all over the country.
[01:25:30.041 --> 01:25:31.442]  Oh, it's something like that.
[01:25:31.482 --> 01:25:32.342]  It's an accident.
[01:25:33.182 --> 01:25:34.743]  There's no accident about it.
[01:25:34.823 --> 01:25:36.123]  It's designed for that.
[01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:39.871]  You're going to have to have it to buy and sell.
[01:25:40.012 --> 01:25:41.433]  Now, I didn't get that out of the Bible.
[01:25:41.893 --> 01:25:43.515]  That's the official plan, okay?
[01:25:43.795 --> 01:25:49.721]  Because a lot of you are atheists or agnostics and anything you've heard that's in the Bible automatically isn't real or you just accept it.
[01:25:51.242 --> 01:25:54.365]  This is a diabolical system to track and trace you, okay?
[01:25:54.786 --> 01:25:55.587]  We're going to get into that.
[01:25:56.247 --> 01:25:58.109]  Also, an amazing story here.
[01:25:58.129 --> 01:25:59.090]  It says, get a grip.
[01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:00.972]  There is no secret North American Union.
[01:26:01.602 --> 01:26:02.583]  It's a long story.
[01:26:02.623 --> 01:26:06.026]  I could spend all day on it, but we don't have time because I'm just going to cover the basics.
[01:26:06.366 --> 01:26:14.513]  We are getting that Bill Maher last night on the MSNBC Countdown program with Keith Upperman.
[01:26:14.533 --> 01:26:15.834]  We're getting that ready for you as well.
[01:26:15.854 --> 01:26:17.195]  We do have guests coming up in the third hour.
[01:26:17.575 --> 01:26:19.757]  But right now, let's go to Nick in Kentucky.
[01:26:19.837 --> 01:26:20.778]  Nick, thanks for holding.
[01:26:21.138 --> 01:26:22.179]  You're on the air.
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.100]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[01:26:24.140 --> 01:26:26.422]  I'd just like to thank you first for all the work that you do.
[01:26:26.763 --> 01:26:27.143]  Thank you.
[01:26:28.075 --> 01:26:30.776]  Alright, and I know you want to talk about Iran.
[01:26:31.136 --> 01:26:36.557]  I think it's strange to me, I don't know if my facts are right or not, but it says that they run a rubber raft.
[01:26:36.677 --> 01:26:37.217]  Is that right?
[01:26:38.957 --> 01:26:49.079]  Yes, they were on a large, one of the larger, medium sized commando carrying a rubber raft, the kind that are used to run up on shore.
[01:26:49.379 --> 01:26:54.620]  But they also use those to interdict small fishing boats and basically harass all of the Iranian shipping.
[01:26:55.405 --> 01:27:03.649]  And we have to remember that right after the first Gulf War, there was actual war with Iran.
[01:27:03.849 --> 01:27:04.949]  I've got to pull the date.
[01:27:05.630 --> 01:27:07.191]  Do you remember when the U.S.
[01:27:07.231 --> 01:27:08.391]  sunk a bunch of their ships?
[01:27:09.552 --> 01:27:18.896]  Yeah, I remember that, but the point I'm trying to get to is, if you've got 15 soldiers on a rubber raft out in the middle of the ocean, that kind of sounds like they're being used as bait to me.
[01:27:21.601 --> 01:27:25.446]  From my understanding, there was a British ship within firing range of the captors.
[01:27:28.166 --> 01:27:30.847]  Well, we're not sure with this case, but with Lebanon we are.
[01:27:31.068 --> 01:27:45.595]  They had sent Israeli soldiers over the border into Lebanon, upwards of three miles, over and over again, and Israeli commandos had the Hezbollah fighters in their scopes when they grabbed the two Israeli soldiers.
[01:27:46.136 --> 01:27:54.020]  And then, that was in Israeli newspapers, but then it was an international announcement that they were in Israel when they grabbed them, and then that lie was just pushed.
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:54.960]  Right.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:56.261]  Well, that's just part of the plot.
[01:28:19.569 --> 01:28:22.110]  The 15 soldiers on a rubber raft sounds a lot like a U.N.
[01:28:22.171 --> 01:28:24.572]  aircraft being flown over Iraq to get Saddam Hussein.
[01:28:24.952 --> 01:28:25.312]  Stay there.
[01:28:25.352 --> 01:28:27.273]  I want you to elaborate on that in your own words.
[01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:28.674]  Yes, the White House memo.
[01:28:29.194 --> 01:28:30.115]  A provocation.
[01:28:31.555 --> 01:28:32.236]  Here's the deal.
[01:28:32.456 --> 01:28:37.358]  Iranians are continually being grabbed in and out of Iraq by the U.S.
[01:28:37.378 --> 01:28:37.818]  and Israel.
[01:28:38.479 --> 01:28:40.720]  But that's no big deal when they kidnap them.
[01:28:43.541 --> 01:28:44.482]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.922 --> 01:28:46.423]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.427 --> 01:28:50.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.230 --> 01:28:55.831]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[01:28:55.971 --> 01:29:02.113]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[01:29:02.253 --> 01:29:11.397]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[01:29:11.617 --> 01:29:12.378]  It's called Slender FX.
[01:29:13.078 --> 01:29:22.322]  SlenderFX opens the door for a healthy metabolism, permanent weight loss, reduction of low thyroid symptoms and considerably increased energy by helping to balance your leptin levels.
[01:29:22.622 --> 01:29:24.683]  Finally a weight loss breakthrough you can trust.
[01:29:24.963 --> 01:29:29.846]  Go to NoFatsNow.com and discover the amazing benefits of SlenderFX today.
[01:29:30.606 --> 01:29:31.887]  The Disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24
[01:29:55.407 --> 01:29:57.949]  What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:29:58.270 --> 01:30:00.151]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:30:00.352 --> 01:30:03.394]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:30:03.575 --> 01:30:06.717]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:07.018 --> 01:30:08.899]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:12.863]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:30:13.143 --> 01:30:15.786]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[01:30:15.806 --> 01:30:19.069]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy.
[01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:19.869]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.983 --> 01:30:39.423]  We're good.
[01:30:53.112 --> 01:30:57.175]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:30:57.375 --> 01:31:00.778]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:31:00.958 --> 01:31:04.461]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:31:04.701 --> 01:31:07.903]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:31:07.923 --> 01:31:13.448]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:31:13.468 --> 01:31:19.092]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now
[01:31:19.172 --> 01:31:23.097]  Well, going for a regular jog a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[01:31:23.218 --> 01:31:24.519]  It's a well thought out formula.
[01:31:24.539 --> 01:31:30.067]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[01:31:30.528 --> 01:31:34.974]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[01:31:35.034 --> 01:31:36.336]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[01:31:36.556 --> 01:31:40.377]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:31:40.437 --> 01:31:41.217]  That toll free number again?
[01:31:41.237 --> 01:31:41.297]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:32:13.381 --> 01:32:29.778]  Yeah, here I come, baby!
[01:32:30.859 --> 01:32:31.520]  Welcome back.
[01:32:32.141 --> 01:32:32.962]  Glad you joined us.
[01:32:37.111 --> 01:32:40.112]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:32:40.132 --> 01:32:41.453]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:41.833 --> 01:32:43.554]  Don't forget we have a free podcast.

[01:32:54.158 --> 01:32:58.280]  And I am asking you, the listeners, to help spread the word about this free service.
[01:32:58.340 --> 01:32:59.600]  We're trying to get the word out.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:01.321]  We're trying to effect change.
[01:33:03.010 --> 01:33:10.333]  We're attempting to mobilize and warn and alert as many people as possible, and we are having a huge effect.
[01:33:10.453 --> 01:33:23.537]  We can have an even bigger exponential effect if you will join the millions of other listeners out there in reaching out to your friends, your family, your neighbors, your message board, your MySpace account, folks at work.
[01:33:23.937 --> 01:33:25.078]  We need your help.
[01:33:25.218 --> 01:33:27.079]  Tell them about InfoWars.com.
[01:33:27.619 --> 01:33:29.319]  Tell them about PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:29.699 --> 01:33:31.020]  Tell them about the free podcast.
[01:33:31.639 --> 01:33:36.022]  Explain to them that the show restreams 21 hours a day after the live show.
[01:33:36.182 --> 01:33:38.643]  24 hours a day, you can tune in whenever you want, how you want.
[01:33:40.924 --> 01:33:47.688]  Please help us reach out to the people of the United States, Canada, Europe, and the world from Africa to China.
[01:33:49.069 --> 01:33:49.969]  We have listeners.
[01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:58.634]  We also have shortwave listeners from 11 to 2 live and back from 9 to midnight on WWCR with also a rebroadcast overnight
[01:33:59.238 --> 01:34:02.800]  So people can listen as far away as Australia during their waking hours.
[01:34:03.501 --> 01:34:04.401]  Nine hours a day.
[01:34:04.421 --> 01:34:06.783]  We're on WWCR.
[01:34:09.765 --> 01:34:10.185]  All right.
[01:34:10.766 --> 01:34:14.328]  I know that we've got Nick and Tom and David and Chris and Bob.
[01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:15.108]  We'll get to all of you.
[01:34:15.189 --> 01:34:23.394]  Nick in Kentucky was bringing up the point that this whole thing with the British patrol boat, little rubber boat, looks very suspicious.
[01:34:23.594 --> 01:34:26.336]  I know they use those boats in the mouth of that river, though.
[01:34:27.091 --> 01:34:29.713]  Classically to go board small fishing vessels.
[01:34:29.733 --> 01:34:41.121]  I know there's massive harassment of basically all the Iranian commerce that comes out is searched and interdicted and imagine having that happen after all that country's been put through by the New World Order.
[01:34:41.882 --> 01:34:43.583]  Again, the government's been overthrown by our government.
[01:34:44.544 --> 01:34:46.125]  And the whole thing is very suspicious.
[01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:50.089]  And we know British commandos have been landed on their beach.
[01:34:50.149 --> 01:34:54.370]  We know in the western area they're killing Iranian police, carrying out bombings.
[01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:55.730]  That's been in the New Yorker magazine.
[01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:56.890]  That's been admitted for two years.
[01:34:57.711 --> 01:34:59.831]  And I just say the Iranians should lay down and take it.
[01:34:59.871 --> 01:35:01.411]  How dare them arrest anybody?
[01:35:01.792 --> 01:35:03.972]  How dare them say they'll fight back of their attack?
[01:35:04.412 --> 01:35:10.914]  They should allow themselves to be overthrown again and let torture camps be set up again and put up with all of it.
[01:35:11.574 --> 01:35:13.634]  Don't you agree with that, Nick?
[01:35:14.615 --> 01:35:15.155]  Yeah, I sure do.
[01:35:16.539 --> 01:35:18.520]  You know, it's the equivalent of the U.N.
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:19.980]  plane being flown over Iraq.
[01:35:20.240 --> 01:35:24.981]  And I think that, you know, the Iraqis didn't take the bait at first.
[01:35:25.181 --> 01:35:29.042]  That's the difference between the Iraqis and the Iranians is the Iranians will.
[01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:37.925]  And they will have some sort of, I guess, quote-unquote, attack, if you will, towards either the British or the U.S., some kind of allied force.
[01:35:37.945 --> 01:35:40.465]  Yeah, historically, Iranians liked to go to war.
[01:35:40.546 --> 01:35:42.026]  And by the way, folks, they're not Arabs.
[01:35:42.782 --> 01:35:45.523]  They're Persians, and I'm not knocking Arab fighters.
[01:35:45.543 --> 01:35:49.205]  They certainly have courage, but they're not known for their aiming the gun.
[01:35:49.265 --> 01:35:50.806]  The Iranians will aim.
[01:35:51.326 --> 01:35:55.568]  The Iranians are not, well, there's 65 million of them, too.
[01:35:56.269 --> 01:35:57.969]  And the globalists want this fight with them.
[01:35:57.989 --> 01:35:58.650]  They're going to start it.
[01:35:59.610 --> 01:35:59.850]  Right.
[01:36:00.591 --> 01:36:09.155]  And, you know, you can turn on the TV all you want to, but they're not going to talk about the real issue, the real reason why we're in Iraq and Iran, and it's to leverage weight on China.
[01:36:10.091 --> 01:36:11.732]  I mean, I think that's the bottom line.
[01:36:11.912 --> 01:36:17.613]  And because China has been slow, in my opinion, to kind of warm up to the New World Order.
[01:36:18.073 --> 01:36:22.135]  So this is kind of being used to say, hey, you know, we can set up bases anywhere we want to set them up.
[01:36:22.575 --> 01:36:24.155]  And we're also going to control your oil supply.
[01:36:31.827 --> 01:36:33.268]  I'm going to get into some news.
[01:36:33.288 --> 01:36:35.228]  There's a bunch of it here on other issues.
[01:36:35.608 --> 01:36:39.610]  Then we'll get back into your calls after I play two short clips.
[01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:45.012]  One of them being uploaded right now is Bill Maher starting to go public on 9-11 Truth.
[01:36:45.052 --> 01:36:45.992]  This is really exciting.
[01:36:46.513 --> 01:36:56.416]  But the first one is a Texas Fox piece about 10,000 gas stations about to start letting you use your driver's license to pay.
[01:36:57.137 --> 01:36:57.857]  Now folks,
[01:36:59.051 --> 01:37:11.417]  This is so revealing, but first off, in the next five minutes or so, I am honored to have Ted Anderson, who's up in studio in Minnesota, on air with us, because gold prices have been steadily climbing again.
[01:37:11.998 --> 01:37:13.498]  They're probably going to explode.
[01:37:13.718 --> 01:37:28.546]  I personally am about to buy a little bit of gold, and every time I think, hey, I think I'll buy a few gold coins from Ted, because I found he's really the best price out there, every time I am about to do that, I think, hey, why not have Ted on, because he is the owner of the network,
[01:37:29.671 --> 01:37:32.434]  So you not only get gold at a great price, you also support the network.
[01:37:32.814 --> 01:37:35.237]  And I said, what do you have a good deal on, Ted?
[01:37:35.257 --> 01:37:40.642]  And literally, folks, there is a 3% markup on these.
[01:37:43.044 --> 01:37:45.947]  I mean, this deal is so good, it is insane.
[01:37:46.247 --> 01:37:50.311]  Ted actually will probably end up, after he fills these orders, losing money on this, okay?
[01:37:50.732 --> 01:37:52.634]  I'm buying some of these very coins.
[01:37:53.114 --> 01:37:55.196]  These are British Sovereigns.
[01:37:55.517 --> 01:37:57.258]  When I heard that, I said, that's it, I'm getting some.
[01:37:57.278 --> 01:37:58.740]  That's what he's got in at a good price.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:03.465]  British Sovereigns are beautiful, high-grade coins, and I have a few.
[01:38:04.185 --> 01:38:06.746]  Yeah, great to be back on the show again, Alex.
[01:38:06.766 --> 01:38:11.067]  It's been a while and I really appreciate you having me out.
[01:38:29.659 --> 01:38:31.721]  Well, Ted, you're getting an insane deal on these.
[01:38:31.741 --> 01:38:33.243]  In fact, it's lower than 3%.
[01:38:33.503 --> 01:38:38.288]  I don't know if you had... I mean, folks, you cannot find coins like this at melt.
[01:38:38.869 --> 01:38:48.799]  And these, as the market's going... Ted, I know every time I get you on, we don't script it prior to discussing it, but do you want to tell folks how much you're marking these up?
[01:38:49.679 --> 01:38:57.346]  Yeah, currently right now, the margin on this one is $9, and the total coin is $179.16, so I guess you can do the math.
[01:38:57.426 --> 01:38:57.987]  I didn't do it.
[01:38:58.047 --> 01:39:04.253]  If it's 3% or if it's less or a little bit more, certainly a fair margin of profit for the dollar value that we're working with.
[01:39:04.273 --> 01:39:05.434]  Well, that's a guesstimation.
[01:39:05.894 --> 01:39:09.117]  Divide, because I want to know if my brain's working.
[01:39:09.157 --> 01:39:09.738]  What is $9 on $170?
[01:39:09.778 --> 01:39:12.040]  You're asking me to do it?
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:14.162]  I don't have a calculator in the studio.
[01:39:14.202 --> 01:39:14.902]  It's ridiculous.
[01:39:16.421 --> 01:39:19.622]  Seriously, folks, this is an insanely good deal.
[01:39:20.342 --> 01:39:21.363]  Ted, why are you doing this?
[01:39:21.863 --> 01:39:30.726]  Well, first of all, it's really important that people get involved in the precious metals market due to the fact that we know for sure we can't trust the United States dollar.
[01:39:30.746 --> 01:39:32.526]  The United States dollar is crashing.
[01:39:32.586 --> 01:39:34.067]  It's been crashing for years.
[01:39:34.487 --> 01:39:38.008]  It's been an ongoing erosion, and now the thing has just fallen out of bed.
[01:39:38.408 --> 01:39:40.969]  People need to have precious metals, there's no question about it.
[01:39:41.409 --> 01:39:44.010]  Second thing is, the sovereign is a quarter ounce gold piece.
[01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:45.090]  It's a good coin to have.
[01:39:45.570 --> 01:39:52.952]  In your pocket just in case that there's something that happens in the future that you know just catastrophic events we all know they're going to happen.
[01:39:53.212 --> 01:39:56.353]  And these are really gorgeous coins at least the Sovereigns I bought before.
[01:39:56.613 --> 01:40:05.135]  Yeah the Sovereign is a real pretty coin being a quarter ounce coin a lot of people like to use them as jewelry pieces and so on and so forth but the main thing is is that you get some gold in your pocket
[01:40:05.575 --> 01:40:05.995]  I don't know.
[01:40:06.015 --> 01:40:08.057]  When you're making $9 a coin, it probably isn't helping much.
[01:40:08.117 --> 01:40:10.798]  But listen, folks, I called Ted this morning and I said, what good deals do you have on gold?
[01:40:10.818 --> 01:40:11.739]  I want to buy a few coins.
[01:40:31.891 --> 01:40:39.083]  And seriously, the dollar just plunged even more, another 2-3% in the last week.
[01:40:39.103 --> 01:40:42.248]  The IMF just said they want it to be depreciated even further.
[01:40:42.789 --> 01:40:45.093]  It's now down by half against the British Pound.
[01:40:45.882 --> 01:40:51.364]  Forty-eight cents since the Euro opened in 2000, and it's only getting worse.
[01:40:51.504 --> 01:40:53.785]  The housing market bubble is clearly imploding.
[01:40:54.185 --> 01:40:56.906]  I'm very upset, and frankly, I don't have time.
[01:40:56.946 --> 01:41:06.930]  I'm trying to make a film, do interviews, do all this other stuff, and I've got to, you know, try to go get some of my children's savings out and put it into this so they've got something maybe in the future.
[01:41:07.230 --> 01:41:09.071]  Okay, folks, that's how bad it is.
[01:41:09.251 --> 01:41:10.212]  I have been raped.
[01:41:10.652 --> 01:41:11.552]  You have been raped.
[01:41:11.672 --> 01:41:13.753]  I should have put more of my money in gold earlier.
[01:41:14.253 --> 01:41:16.974]  I mean, thank God I did buy gold when it was $320 an ounce.
[01:41:17.475 --> 01:41:18.375]  I bought it when it was $750.
[01:41:18.455 --> 01:41:22.157]  Now it's $600 and what?
[01:41:22.517 --> 01:41:27.700]  It's $667 right now, but the thing is, it's up $100 an ounce within the last three months.
[01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:31.702]  People get so complacent, they forget about where we've been and where we're going.
[01:41:32.222 --> 01:41:34.203]  The United States dollar is in tough shape.
[01:41:34.223 --> 01:41:36.784]  You're going to be paying a lot more for gallons of gasoline.
[01:41:36.804 --> 01:41:39.505]  The housing market is going to boom even further, I'm sure.
[01:41:39.545 --> 01:41:40.805]  Listen, here's the news I've got.
[01:41:40.865 --> 01:41:42.726]  It says that Europe is dumping the dollar.
[01:41:43.126 --> 01:41:44.247]  China is dumping the dollar.
[01:41:44.287 --> 01:41:45.747]  They're going to dump one trillion.
[01:41:46.087 --> 01:41:47.368]  Large parts of one trillion.
[01:41:47.388 --> 01:41:48.768]  They won't say exactly how much.
[01:41:49.068 --> 01:41:49.829]  Let me just find it.
[01:41:49.849 --> 01:41:50.449]  I just had it.
[01:41:51.318 --> 01:41:54.642]  Uh, here, China to ship to Euros on Iran oil?
[01:41:54.803 --> 01:41:55.363]  Reuters?
[01:41:55.724 --> 01:41:56.645]  That's today?
[01:41:56.705 --> 01:42:00.169]  I mean, I've got, like, ten articles here in the three stacks in front of me, Ted.
[01:42:00.469 --> 01:42:01.330]  I'm freaking out.
[01:42:01.391 --> 01:42:04.014]  And I'm, yes, folks, yes, I'm saying freak out.
[01:42:04.294 --> 01:42:05.215]  I'm freaking out!
[01:42:05.435 --> 01:42:06.697]  This is horrible!
[01:42:06.977 --> 01:42:09.020]  But at least you can get a real medal.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:10.301]  Give Ted a call.
[01:42:10.321 --> 01:42:10.842]  Ted, give him a number.
[01:42:11.142 --> 01:42:14.323]  Yeah, the number is 1-800-686-2237.
[01:42:14.383 --> 01:42:18.324]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:42:18.724 --> 01:42:21.405]  As for the British Sovereigns, they're 179.16.
[01:42:21.885 --> 01:42:23.926]  I don't see how you can go wrong with a coin like this.
[01:42:23.986 --> 01:42:26.487]  It's a great way to get involved in the precious metals market.
[01:42:26.867 --> 01:42:29.888]  And I know everybody's asking me, well, how can I help out the cause?
[01:42:30.188 --> 01:42:34.689]  Well, this is a great way to help out the cause, because you're donating nine bucks to it every time you buy a coin.
[01:42:35.349 --> 01:42:36.790]  So it's a quarter ounce of gold.
[01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:38.090]  Now, I've got my red book.
[01:42:38.130 --> 01:42:39.070]  I've got like three years of it.
[01:42:39.090 --> 01:42:40.671]  I'm not a coin expert, but I know a little bit.
[01:42:42.646 --> 01:42:46.549]  The British Auburns look like the gorgeous maple leaf, don't they, on the face side?
[01:42:46.849 --> 01:42:49.972]  Yeah, I can't remember which king it is, but it's one of the kings that are up there.
[01:42:50.012 --> 01:42:51.133]  It's a beautiful coin.
[01:42:51.193 --> 01:42:54.035]  Like I said, a lot of people like to use it for a jewelry piece.
[01:42:55.216 --> 01:42:58.679]  It's great for that kind of thing, but that's not the first purpose to be buying this coin.
[01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:04.604]  But doesn't it also have a semi-numismatic value, and you're getting it basically at market?
[01:43:05.404 --> 01:43:06.365]  I mean, you're getting it near melt.
[01:43:06.885 --> 01:43:11.829]  Yeah, it's a coin that was manufactured in the early 1900s, and it is.
[01:43:11.989 --> 01:43:25.399]  You're getting it at the melt price right now, and that's a great way to be getting involved in it, because British sovereigns have carried real big premiums in the past, and there's a lot of companies that, if you call them up and look for this particular coin, they're going to be charging $250.
[01:43:25.459 --> 01:43:28.421]  What do you add around that right now at this time?
[01:43:28.441 --> 01:43:34.506]  Yeah, what happened is, back in 2000, I started having a few dollars here and there to buy a coin here, a coin there.
[01:43:35.206 --> 01:43:41.392]  And I shopped around, folks, and I found that Ted is really a good deal, especially when he offers these deals.
[01:43:41.492 --> 01:43:45.296]  I mean, you cannot beat this.
[01:43:45.316 --> 01:43:46.457]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:43:46.697 --> 01:43:47.698]  Give that number again, Ted.
[01:43:48.258 --> 01:43:50.741]  Yeah, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:43:50.881 --> 01:43:53.483]  And again, I want to thank the listeners for being so supportive.
[01:43:54.384 --> 01:43:56.386]  Well, I mean, this is a good deal.
[01:43:56.446 --> 01:43:59.749]  Even if you can get one coin or three or four coins like I do every few months,
[01:44:00.805 --> 01:44:22.050]  This is such an important investment, and again, I would, I mean personally, I would, you know, bury a little here, put a little in a safety deposit box, give a little bit to family to keep for you, you know, just spread it around, because this is a real insurance policy, and I believe in gold, guns, and guts, and some storable food as well.
[01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.130]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:44:22.150 --> 01:44:22.210]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:44:28.146 --> 01:44:28.929]  2237 or MidasResources.com
[01:44:33.576 --> 01:44:34.316]  Anything else, Ted?
[01:44:34.676 --> 01:44:35.917]  No, that's all I've got.
[01:44:35.957 --> 01:44:41.198]  Just get in the precious metals market, all the handwritings on the wall, the GAO is even saying it on the document.
[01:44:41.238 --> 01:44:43.098]  If you haven't seen that, ask for that document.
[01:44:43.598 --> 01:44:46.879]  I mean, the United States government is telling you that the dollar is crashing.
[01:44:46.959 --> 01:44:48.059]  They're total bastards.
[01:44:48.419 --> 01:44:50.000]  It's time to get out, there's no question.
[01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:51.960]  Why do you think the elite are allowing this to happen?
[01:44:51.980 --> 01:45:00.102]  There's no doubting that they're engineering a slow decline of the dollar, but once you start down, then it accelerates, and I'm seeing massive acceleration.
[01:45:00.362 --> 01:45:11.073]  Well, you know, you and I both have said that, I mean, the elite want to have an American Union that covers the United States, Mexico, South America, put it all together.
[01:45:11.093 --> 01:45:16.198]  They want to have world taxes with this Kyoto Treaty.
[01:45:16.819 --> 01:45:19.962]  There's just so many things that are going on that's driving it to
[01:45:20.522 --> 01:45:23.305]  New World Order, One World Government, that kind of thing.
[01:45:23.745 --> 01:45:36.077]  And the United States dollar, it has to crash in order to do that because otherwise the United States citizens won't feel uncomfortable enough to sign on to these treaties and these different things that the elite want us to have.
[01:45:36.597 --> 01:45:46.265]  And at this particular point in time, if you don't become independent, I mean, right now, I mean, our best hope right now is Ron Paul, and then, you know, take your money and put it into gold and silver.
[01:45:46.285 --> 01:45:47.186]  There's no question about it.
[01:45:47.206 --> 01:45:48.307]  You've got to be involved with that.
[01:45:48.347 --> 01:45:52.711]  Get away from this paper currency that's driven by debt.
[01:45:53.371 --> 01:45:54.792]  That's created by the Federal Reserve.
[01:45:54.812 --> 01:45:58.314]  Well, fiat's fine if they don't devalue it to the value of toilet paper.
[01:45:58.334 --> 01:45:59.235]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:46:00.536 --> 01:46:03.157]  They have devalued it that they're showing.
[01:46:03.317 --> 01:46:04.959]  They're saying they're going to devalue it further.
[01:46:05.179 --> 01:46:06.199]  They are total trash.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:07.620]  Gold will only go up.
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:08.281]  Get in now.
[01:46:08.301 --> 01:46:08.721]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:46:08.741 --> 01:46:09.261]  Ted, thank you.
[01:46:09.501 --> 01:46:10.242]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:46:13.804 --> 01:46:17.846]  Alright, now I've got to really accelerate here because we've got guests coming up and I want to get to your calls before we do that.
[01:46:18.266 --> 01:46:22.368]  Here is the local news piece, Total Whitewash, and we did check on it.
[01:46:22.388 --> 01:46:24.990]  There were similar pieces all over the country and many other markets.
[01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:37.216]  Here's Austin, Texas, Fox News, about the wonderful new system to buy gas with your credit card, I mean with your driver's license as a credit card, and the government is warning you.
[01:46:37.456 --> 01:46:41.718]  The government's behind this, but then the government is warning you.
[01:46:41.738 --> 01:46:42.058]  Here it is.
[01:46:43.234 --> 01:46:45.835]  What if you could use your driver's license to pay for gas?
[01:46:46.916 --> 01:46:52.359]  I don't have to use a separate debit card or MasterCard, and if I lose my driver's license, no one else can use it.
[01:46:53.179 --> 01:46:55.220]  Well, now you can, and it can save you money.
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:47:00.423]  But before you sign up, 7-On-Your-Side tells you what security precautions you ought to take.
[01:47:01.929 --> 01:47:05.170]  Your main piece of identification could be your next debit card.
[01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:07.671]  At least there is one company that's banking on it.
[01:47:08.151 --> 01:47:15.394]  The experiment seems to be working in Austin, but 7 On Your Side's Chris Coffey explains why the state is cautioning consumers about this.
[01:47:21.952 --> 01:47:26.117]  Move over Visa and MasterCard, that other card in your wallet wants to pay.
[01:47:26.417 --> 01:47:27.058]  I think it's great.
[01:47:27.218 --> 01:47:32.985]  Aurora Bissig pays for gas with her Texas driver's license at this station on South Congress.
[01:47:33.346 --> 01:47:35.308]  She gets a discounted price as well.
[01:47:35.408 --> 01:47:40.815]  I don't have to use a separate debit card or MasterCard, and if I lose my driver's license, someone else can use it.
[01:47:42.356 --> 01:47:51.003]  National Payment Card offers the program where a consumer links his or her driver's license to a personal bank account and PIN number.
[01:47:51.143 --> 01:47:53.745]  In this case it's legal because they're a financial institution.
[01:47:53.825 --> 01:48:00.530]  Texas DPS says it's also legal because the license is only used as a means to access the PIN number.
[01:48:01.011 --> 01:48:04.533]  And the company stresses your personal information is not sold.
[01:48:04.994 --> 01:48:06.615]  Aurora says she's not worried.
[01:48:06.895 --> 01:48:12.959]  I was at first when you realize that you use a pen that is not similar to your date of birth or any part of your driver's license.
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:22.946]  A question that folks probably ought to ask themselves is do they feel comfortable with providing that much information to a company?
[01:48:22.986 --> 01:48:29.550]  The process allows merchants to cut down normal credit card processing fees and pass the savings to their customers.
[01:48:30.011 --> 01:48:36.655]  Still, there's a spending limit and your license can only pay for gas and items at participating convenience stores.
[01:48:38.376 --> 01:48:42.517]  Now, Austin is currently a test market for the program.
[01:48:42.537 --> 01:48:49.539]  A national payment card says it expects 10,000 gas stations will participate in the program by the end of this year.
[01:48:50.860 --> 01:48:51.240]  Okay.
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:53.901]  Number one, you heard them say you get a discounted price.
[01:48:53.961 --> 01:49:04.124]  Just like when you get the Trusted Traveler, which just so happens to be the real ID card, which is your North American ID card when you read the SPP documents, that you get to go to the head of the line and go through security.
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:07.221]  Or, oh, you live on the Canadian border.
[01:49:07.261 --> 01:49:08.842]  You can go get a special driver's license.
[01:49:08.862 --> 01:49:10.604]  The feds are now offering through your state.
[01:49:11.264 --> 01:49:13.966]  See, at first it's, oh, select people can do this.
[01:49:14.006 --> 01:49:15.568]  And then it's, oh, everybody can do it.
[01:49:15.588 --> 01:49:17.369]  And then, oh, you've got to do it.
[01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:20.291]  Because I've read the federal documents.
[01:49:20.812 --> 01:49:24.134]  How many years have I told you, you will use your driver's license?
[01:49:24.194 --> 01:49:27.477]  It was standardized in 93 to be used as a payment system.
[01:49:28.017 --> 01:49:31.900]  They had it by 1994 as law in Finland.
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:33.181]  This is how they lived there.
[01:49:33.501 --> 01:49:34.342]  This is the model.
[01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:36.912]  They're now doing it in Singapore.
[01:49:36.952 --> 01:49:37.913]  They've already done it.
[01:49:38.194 --> 01:49:39.375]  They're doing it here.
[01:49:39.715 --> 01:49:42.038]  You'll have to have it to buy and sell.
[01:49:42.278 --> 01:49:44.380]  We'll tell you why on the other side.
[01:49:44.681 --> 01:49:46.903]  And no, this is not from revelations, folks.
[01:49:47.103 --> 01:49:48.385]  This is from the documents.
[01:49:48.605 --> 01:49:49.246]  This is real.
[01:49:56.315 --> 01:50:01.760]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:09.787]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.484 --> 01:50:17.526]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.927 --> 01:50:29.350]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.670 --> 01:50:33.132]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.632 --> 01:50:35.552]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.893 --> 01:50:39.734]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:52:53.903 --> 01:52:56.764]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:56.804 --> 01:52:58.785]  Here's George Bush's anthem song.
[01:53:14.099 --> 01:53:18.164]  This is what George Bush sings there at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:53:19.466 --> 01:53:23.671]  And according to the Christian leaders in our country, this is Christianity now.
[01:53:24.412 --> 01:53:27.095]  And if you're against the devil, you are the devil.
[01:53:28.063 --> 01:53:31.246]  I shouldn't stop my walk when staring back at me.
[01:53:31.286 --> 01:53:34.569]  Cause in my dreams, it's always there.
[01:53:34.609 --> 01:53:42.877]  The evil place that twists my mind and brings me to despair.
[01:53:47.859 --> 01:53:49.861]  Again, George Bush's theme song.
[01:53:50.801 --> 01:53:52.443]  We are fighting this.
[01:53:52.463 --> 01:53:55.465]  We are fighting the National Audit Card Casual Society Control Grid.
[01:53:55.805 --> 01:53:56.686]  And we are bad.
[01:53:56.726 --> 01:54:02.130]  National Talk Show hosts say, I'm of the devil, because I'm against this.
[01:54:27.157 --> 01:54:28.879]  All right, welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:31.121 --> 01:54:47.038]  I thought we'd play that since we were talking about the National ID card that is your federally standardized driver's license and Neil Bortz and everybody constantly never shut up about the fair tax and the good old boys call in and go we just absolutely gotta have it for America.
[01:54:48.263 --> 01:54:50.124]  They're going, let me just explain it, okay?
[01:54:50.244 --> 01:54:58.049]  They're going, this is official, they're going to keep the income tax and change it to the Social Security tax and claim it's pegged at 10%.
[01:54:59.910 --> 01:55:08.896]  Then, they're going to have a national sales tax, but it's going to be graduated if you make below the poverty line, you will not pay a sales tax.
[01:55:09.717 --> 01:55:10.237]  Okay?
[01:55:10.957 --> 01:55:16.501]  This was thought up, I learned of this 12 years ago and was reading different federal documents and plans and different think tanks putting it out.
[01:55:17.071 --> 01:55:23.053]  They're going to keep both, but then to make sure you're not cheating on your sales tax, we need to get this message out to people.
[01:55:24.374 --> 01:55:29.696]  To make sure the feds are going to have control and have officers that are involved in your everyday life.
[01:55:29.716 --> 01:55:31.817]  Forget the IRS, this will make them look like choir boys.
[01:55:32.277 --> 01:55:33.577]  This will make them look like the good guys.
[01:55:34.938 --> 01:55:40.420]  And they're going to stomp around the world, our financial world, here in our country,
[01:55:41.889 --> 01:55:44.110]  And every purchase you make will also be tracked.
[01:55:44.170 --> 01:55:46.552]  What you eat, what you do, what you buy will be tracked.
[01:55:46.572 --> 01:55:48.173]  That will be given to the insurance companies.
[01:55:48.573 --> 01:55:54.076]  As our health care is more socialized, they're going to penalize you with higher taxes for junk food.
[01:55:54.416 --> 01:55:56.197]  You're now seeing that being implemented.
[01:55:56.257 --> 01:55:59.239]  Lots of different types of foods will be banned, will be restricted.
[01:55:59.259 --> 01:56:02.121]  They'll know how much alcohol you're drinking, how many cigarettes you're smoking.
[01:56:02.942 --> 01:56:05.004]  Already, Bush signed an executive order four years ago.
[01:56:05.044 --> 01:56:07.766]  Every prescription you get is instantly uploaded to the feds.
[01:56:08.247 --> 01:56:11.610]  No judge, no jury, no warrant, no indictment, no nothing.
[01:56:11.850 --> 01:56:12.771]  Check into it for yourself.
[01:56:13.292 --> 01:56:25.144]  Well, with this new system, again, because people will go out and have folks that are in a lower tax bracket buy things for them, they'll have to keep track of what you're buying to make sure there's not cheating.
[01:56:25.814 --> 01:56:26.294]  You see?
[01:56:26.314 --> 01:56:29.215]  And you're going to have to swipe that driver's license.
[01:56:29.275 --> 01:56:40.319]  So, ten plus years ago, they had almost every state with the barcode on it, with the digital photo, thumbprint or index fingerprint, face scan on the photo, and that script on the back.
[01:56:40.779 --> 01:56:45.201]  And I told you a few years ago about my friend who managed a Diamond Shamrock, now Valero.
[01:56:47.422 --> 01:56:48.162]  And what happened?
[01:56:49.580 --> 01:56:55.083]  I saw an old lady buying beer and cigarettes there and he was scanning her license and when people walked out he said, look at this.
[01:56:55.723 --> 01:57:00.166]  And he took my license and he scanned it and there was my date of birth and my name and if I had warrants.
[01:57:00.706 --> 01:57:06.309]  And he said, yeah, the executives are telling us in the future, if you had warrants, the police are to be called.
[01:57:08.150 --> 01:57:09.911]  You talk about control, folks.
[01:57:12.831 --> 01:57:18.536]  Five, six months ago, it was in the news that people were stealing gas because, oh, the driver's license for some reason tricks the machine.
[01:57:19.157 --> 01:57:20.238]  It's already set up.
[01:57:21.018 --> 01:57:23.060]  Your bank account will be government-controlled.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:27.464]  Everything will be tracked, and you're going to do most of your buying and selling off of that sucker.
[01:57:28.064 --> 01:57:28.505]  Okay?
[01:57:29.285 --> 01:57:31.647]  But they're telling you it's just being interviewed.
[01:57:32.968 --> 01:57:37.853]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.269 --> 01:57:49.909]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:51.650]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.351 --> 01:57:53.472]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.112 --> 01:57:54.932]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.673 --> 01:57:57.594]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.614 --> 01:58:00.876]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.436 --> 01:58:05.559]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.642 --> 01:58:12.883]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:58:12.923 --> 01:58:13.864]  until 2 p.m.
[01:58:13.984 --> 01:58:17.246]  Central Standard Time, we're here live
[01:58:18.357 --> 01:58:19.557]  We're now already in the third hour.
[01:58:19.597 --> 01:58:21.097]  A very important interview is coming up.
[01:58:21.137 --> 01:58:22.138]  I want you to record this.
[01:58:22.538 --> 01:58:24.238]  I want you to tell your friends and family to tune in.
[01:58:24.658 --> 01:58:27.059]  Because there are literal monsters all around us.
[01:58:27.079 --> 01:58:31.839]  There are criminal pieces of filth operating with impunity all around us.
[01:58:31.899 --> 01:58:33.060]  And I want you to know who they are.
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:35.400]  Right now, let's blitz through three calls.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:37.120]  Tom and PA, then David and Bob.
[01:58:37.420 --> 01:58:38.120]  Tom, you're on the air.
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:38.760]  Thanks for holding.
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:44.101]  Tom, you're on the air, thanks.
[01:58:44.722 --> 01:58:46.382]  Hi Alex, how you doing?
[01:58:46.522 --> 01:58:47.422]  Hey man, go ahead.
[01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:52.143]  Hey, I just wanted to say, you know, that Iranian thing you were talking about earlier.
[01:58:52.163 --> 01:59:02.090]  It does definitely look like we're going in there, but one of the things I wanted to ask you is, what do you feel about the prophecies, and what are you doing to prepare for something like that?
[01:59:03.691 --> 01:59:06.353]  Well, it's... I am personally prepared.
[01:59:06.373 --> 01:59:11.377]  I have two years of storable food, not because I live in fear, because I've got, you know, that's my insurance.
[01:59:11.938 --> 01:59:14.780]  I've got firearms to protect my family stud properly.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:15.941]  I have
[01:59:16.966 --> 01:59:38.549]  A little bit of precious metals and I have basic preparedness items and I do my best to warn people and wake people up about what's happening in the world and nobody in my family is going to be drafted and I'm not going to any FEMA camp because that's all being announced and I certainly hope it doesn't come to that and I'm trying to avert and try to get people to wake up and get involved so we can be given a reprieve.
[01:59:39.312 --> 01:59:40.273]  Any kind of shelter?
[01:59:40.293 --> 01:59:41.794]  Do you have a shelter?
[01:59:41.814 --> 01:59:44.315]  Or are you just storing your food?
[01:59:44.675 --> 01:59:46.096]  Well, a shelter from what?
[01:59:46.176 --> 01:59:48.358]  The Iranians can't hit us with any nuclear weapons.
[01:59:48.938 --> 01:59:50.479]  I don't think the Russians are.
[01:59:51.059 --> 01:59:53.721]  I live near a major military center.
[01:59:54.302 --> 01:59:58.104]  If the Russians ever decided to hit us, I probably would die in the hit.
[01:59:58.504 --> 02:00:05.869]  There are probably four or five MIRV missiles targeted just on Austin, and there's probably fifty
[02:00:06.249 --> 02:00:08.071]  Yeah, I just want to say it's got me infuriated.
[02:00:08.091 --> 02:00:11.273]  I try real hard to get out and tell as many people as I can.
[02:00:11.293 --> 02:00:14.596]  I travel a lot so I bought a CB and it just seems like within the last year
[02:00:34.278 --> 02:00:35.979]  It's just, it exploded.
[02:00:36.019 --> 02:00:39.160]  People are starting to come, you know, awake into this.
[02:00:39.320 --> 02:00:42.381]  And it's pretty awesome to hear truck drivers talk about it.
[02:00:42.561 --> 02:00:43.001]  Exactly.
[02:00:43.041 --> 02:00:46.122]  I'm glad folks are waking up, because they better, because it's coming down on us.
[02:00:46.862 --> 02:00:47.522]  Yes, it is.
[02:00:47.863 --> 02:00:50.383]  Well, thanks for having me on your show, Alex.
[02:00:50.863 --> 02:00:51.984]  Hey, I appreciate you calling.
[02:00:52.024 --> 02:00:53.344]  It's good to have you on board, my friend.
[02:00:53.864 --> 02:00:55.465]  Let's talk to David in Oklahoma.
[02:00:55.485 --> 02:00:56.085]  Go ahead, David.
[02:00:57.946 --> 02:01:00.127]  Yeah, this is David with Falsetruth.org.
[02:01:00.347 --> 02:01:01.147]  Hey, how you doing?
[02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:03.541]  I was going to put out a call to action.
[02:01:03.761 --> 02:01:06.683]  Rudolph Giuliani is going to be in Oklahoma City tomorrow.
[02:01:07.563 --> 02:01:13.226]  KOCO, Channel 5 News, didn't give a time and didn't give a place, Oklahoma History Center.
[02:01:14.107 --> 02:01:15.308]  But they wouldn't give a time.
[02:01:15.328 --> 02:01:17.709]  Well, you could probably call the Oklahoma City Center and they'll tell you.
[02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.770]  Yeah.
[02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:21.991]  I went on their website last night and it didn't show anything for that day.
[02:01:22.011 --> 02:01:24.813]  Well, these people creep around because everywhere they go there's protesters.
[02:01:24.893 --> 02:01:26.054]  It's the Oklahoma what center?
[02:01:26.834 --> 02:01:30.276]  Oklahoma History Center, right across the street from the state capitol.
[02:01:31.758 --> 02:01:36.703]  And they won't tell us in this free country when his Lordship is going to be showing up?
[02:01:36.723 --> 02:01:37.784]  I don't know.
[02:01:37.824 --> 02:01:41.267]  They don't want anybody to know.
[02:01:41.547 --> 02:01:48.153]  They'll have a hundred of his stage minions there claiming it was a throng of the citizens worshipping him.
[02:01:49.696 --> 02:01:49.916]  Yep.
[02:01:50.257 --> 02:01:54.580]  You know they have fake town hall meetings everywhere where no one's allowed in, but then on the news they announce it.
[02:01:54.940 --> 02:01:55.841]  Everyone loves it!
[02:01:56.462 --> 02:01:57.883]  This was free to the public!
[02:01:57.903 --> 02:02:01.666]  And then they take your driver's license number at the Democrat and Republican meetings now.
[02:02:02.627 --> 02:02:02.827]  Yep.
[02:02:03.247 --> 02:02:05.709]  Can I make a comment about the... Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:02:06.149 --> 02:02:06.510]  Go ahead.
[02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:09.652]  Can I make a comment about the driver's license number?
[02:02:09.732 --> 02:02:10.353]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:02:11.194 --> 02:02:12.755]  Here in Oklahoma they have Crick Thrift.
[02:02:13.426 --> 02:02:18.568]  And if you give them your driver's license number, they'll give you a quick start card that turns the pump on for you.
[02:02:18.988 --> 02:02:24.991]  And if you steal their gas, it automatically goes on your driving record.
[02:02:25.011 --> 02:02:26.731]  You're treating us all like criminals.
[02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.132]  Oh, you're all criminals.
[02:02:28.172 --> 02:02:31.253]  Get registered with us to be able to buy gas.
[02:02:31.293 --> 02:02:34.715]  See folks, we're inches away from not having cash anymore.
[02:02:35.395 --> 02:02:36.375]  Anything else you want to add, sir?
[02:02:37.276 --> 02:02:37.856]  Ah, that's it.
[02:02:38.996 --> 02:02:39.797]  Okay, thank you.
[02:02:39.817 --> 02:02:40.377]  God bless you.
[02:02:40.397 --> 02:02:41.077]  Call back again.
[02:02:41.097 --> 02:02:42.658]  Alright, we'll be right back with our guest.
[02:02:48.161 --> 02:02:53.605]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.005 --> 02:03:01.630]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.327 --> 02:03:09.369]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.790 --> 02:03:21.193]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.513 --> 02:03:24.955]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.455 --> 02:03:27.415]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.736 --> 02:03:31.597]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:50.922 --> 02:03:55.063]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.483 --> 02:03:56.324]  So what do you do?
[02:03:56.644 --> 02:04:01.205]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:01.685 --> 02:04:03.826]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:05:55.871 --> 02:05:57.792]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.812 --> 02:06:01.075]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.635 --> 02:06:05.758]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.798 --> 02:06:16.966]  Coming up later, I will play a little clip of Keith Uberman with Bill Maher talking about 9-11.
[02:06:18.766 --> 02:06:20.648]  It's only about a minute and a half long, but that's coming up later.
[02:06:21.268 --> 02:06:23.870]  We'll try to jam some of your calls in the last 20 minutes as well.
[02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:30.255]  Governments killed over 200 million people in the 20th century.
[02:06:30.855 --> 02:06:31.856]  Over 200 million.
[02:06:33.277 --> 02:06:34.378]  Stalin 60 mil.
[02:06:34.858 --> 02:06:37.400]  The Chinese government officially admits they killed 60 million.
[02:06:37.420 --> 02:06:39.342]  That's them saying they did it.
[02:06:40.563 --> 02:06:42.444]  Pol Pot killed conservatively 2 million.
[02:06:44.586 --> 02:06:48.409]  You start adding it up, it's over 200 million in the 20th century alone.
[02:06:49.443 --> 02:06:52.771]  By the very same fellow travelers, the people running our society today.
[02:06:53.312 --> 02:06:57.181]  In the old Soviet Union, millions of children...
[02:06:57.992 --> 02:06:59.053]  Or taken from their parents.
[02:06:59.073 --> 02:07:07.701]  You always hear about big Russian orphanages and they go show the children running around naked and abused and piles of feces everywhere.
[02:07:07.721 --> 02:07:10.864]  And I'm sure you've seen on the national news the last 20-30 years.
[02:07:10.924 --> 02:07:11.885]  I've seen it many times.
[02:07:12.545 --> 02:07:13.446]  Why is it so bad?
[02:07:13.486 --> 02:07:14.988]  Because they took so many children.
[02:07:15.468 --> 02:07:16.769]  They had social services.
[02:07:16.809 --> 02:07:17.991]  They had CPS there.
[02:07:18.211 --> 02:07:19.932]  They had hate crimes there, folks.
[02:07:20.393 --> 02:07:21.794]  That's where all that comes from.
[02:07:21.814 --> 02:07:22.675]  Do you understand that?
[02:07:24.657 --> 02:07:27.018]  In China, they'd take the children and put them in factories.
[02:07:27.118 --> 02:07:30.540]  It's a little bit better than what Russia did.
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:33.801]  This is social engineering.
[02:07:33.881 --> 02:07:42.865]  I have the CPS Calhoun reader that the University of Texas was using just a few years ago, and I have the actual textbook, where it says the family is a disease.
[02:07:42.905 --> 02:07:44.066]  This is what social workers take.
[02:07:44.631 --> 02:07:46.332]  Now, I'm not saying all social workers are bad.
[02:07:46.352 --> 02:07:57.818]  The social workers that help retarded kids do a good job, and the social workers that help with adoption, it's certain key cadres, certain cores, the ones that go out and grab the children, they are the crooks.
[02:07:58.358 --> 02:08:10.605]  And even the ones that aren't pedophiles or aren't perverts or weren't abused and think everybody else is abusive, a lot of them are just mental patient types, they still violate the law under color of law, snatching kids all the time.
[02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:17.073]  As of three or four years ago, 3,000 children were missing in Florida.
[02:08:17.253 --> 02:08:18.654]  The CPS couldn't say where they were.
[02:08:19.615 --> 02:08:24.638]  It turned out the top three that ran CPS were convicted child rapists and the system was full of them.
[02:08:25.398 --> 02:08:26.599]  Now it's all over the news.
[02:08:26.719 --> 02:08:27.900]  In Texas, the same thing.
[02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:29.841]  We've got the U.S.
[02:08:29.901 --> 02:08:31.702]  Attorney saying and the U.S.
[02:08:31.742 --> 02:08:33.223]  Prosecutor saying in a letter.
[02:08:34.844 --> 02:08:35.824]  This isn't World Net Daily.
[02:08:35.864 --> 02:08:36.865]  This isn't the Dallas Morning News.
[02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:46.454]  Saying, well, maybe the kids in these prisons, in these juvenile justice halls, maybe it didn't hurt them to be raped at all-night rape parties.
[02:08:47.014 --> 02:08:48.895]  Maybe they wanted it.
[02:08:48.996 --> 02:08:50.376]  Maybe it was consensual.
[02:08:50.516 --> 02:08:51.677]  I mean, it says this.
[02:08:52.377 --> 02:08:55.039]  So see, now they're in the open saying they can do it.
[02:08:55.339 --> 02:09:00.262]  And then you hear about it in the news, on the TV, and it's, oh, there's the problem at the Texas Youth Commission.
[02:09:02.223 --> 02:09:04.004]  Oregon, California,
[02:09:06.153 --> 02:09:08.195]  New York, Florida, and Texas.
[02:09:09.396 --> 02:09:14.200]  Connecticut's bad too, but statistically and the numbers we have are the worst.
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:17.102]  And we know these states are run by pedophile ranks.
[02:09:17.703 --> 02:09:20.525]  Now I'm going to shut up about this and let our guest go over it.
[02:09:21.806 --> 02:09:25.889]  We have his pastor on the line as well and he can be introduced.
[02:09:25.929 --> 02:09:31.654]  Greg Pound and Melissa Pound have had their four children taken away by DCF.
[02:09:33.291 --> 02:09:36.654]  I call him CPS for over two years because one child was bitten by a dog.
[02:09:36.694 --> 02:09:48.424]  Greg spent a month in the county jail for refusing to tell Judge Marion Fleming where his wife is living with their new baby named Moses, because Judge Fleming and DCF want to take that child away too.
[02:09:48.965 --> 02:09:54.629]  Now they're about to terminate their, and they'll change their names and place them with other people.
[02:09:56.323 --> 02:10:04.126]  Again, I don't have time to go over it all, but every time you hear about abuse, it's some foster parents burning the children, torturing them, having them live in cages.
[02:10:04.446 --> 02:10:06.267]  And judges have said, well, you can have them live in cages.
[02:10:06.687 --> 02:10:08.708]  And they warehouse them, they get a bunch of money for them.
[02:10:08.768 --> 02:10:11.329]  I'm not saying all foster parents, but a goodly some.
[02:10:12.650 --> 02:10:13.410]  It's a moneymaker.
[02:10:14.133 --> 02:10:16.954]  Folks, I work for a carpet cleaning company, so I've been in a lot of houses.
[02:10:17.574 --> 02:10:26.477]  And you'd go to houses, and there'd be dirty mattresses in different rooms, disheveled kids, pot smoke everywhere, some fat-bellied perverts stomping around.
[02:10:26.497 --> 02:10:27.638]  They're there cleaning their carpets.
[02:10:28.398 --> 02:10:30.319]  I mean, I've been in these foster homes.
[02:10:30.399 --> 02:10:31.059]  Okay, I've seen it.
[02:10:31.719 --> 02:10:33.160]  I've seen these buckets of trash.
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:37.521]  And I'm going to shop about it, because our guests are there.
[02:10:37.541 --> 02:10:38.842]  I'm trying to give you some background.
[02:10:39.957 --> 02:10:41.777]  Over a million children are grabbed each year.
[02:10:41.817 --> 02:10:44.038]  What was 1.4 million last time I saw a statistic.
[02:10:44.478 --> 02:10:47.199]  You're five times more likely to be abused in their custody.
[02:10:47.419 --> 02:10:49.519]  And that's whitewashed, watered down numbers.
[02:10:49.799 --> 02:10:51.439]  That's the government reporting on itself.
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.200]  This is hell on earth.
[02:10:55.460 --> 02:11:00.441]  And, you know, my wife has friends that are middle class, some of them wealthy.
[02:11:01.662 --> 02:11:04.062]  And, you know, children that our children are friends with.
[02:11:04.082 --> 02:11:04.942]  They've got a playgroup.
[02:11:05.222 --> 02:11:08.603]  And, you know, my wife goes to playgroup and goes, where's Jenny?
[02:11:09.364 --> 02:11:17.652]  Well, right now the CPS has got her, and then she met another family where she'd known for a few years who told her about this.
[02:11:17.972 --> 02:11:20.474]  Same thing, but they were fighting to keep the child because they don't know.
[02:11:21.215 --> 02:11:23.938]  Children, if they fall out of a tree, my mother broke her arm in a tree.
[02:11:25.581 --> 02:11:26.802]  I broke bones climbing things.
[02:11:26.862 --> 02:11:27.543]  I broke fingers.
[02:11:28.123 --> 02:11:30.745]  If you break your finger, and there's witnesses, it doesn't matter.
[02:11:30.765 --> 02:11:31.686]  You go to the hospital.
[02:11:31.987 --> 02:11:33.408]  The doctor says, why did this happen?
[02:11:33.448 --> 02:11:34.769]  By law, they're told to do this.
[02:11:35.049 --> 02:11:35.710]  They report you.
[02:11:35.730 --> 02:11:36.390]  CPS comes.
[02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:37.191]  They say, sign this.
[02:11:37.351 --> 02:11:38.232]  Your kids are gone, folks.
[02:11:39.013 --> 02:11:41.535]  Literally, literally, my children have never gotten hurt.
[02:11:42.015 --> 02:11:58.186]  And literally, because of this, we have to stand over them outside, stand over them on the jungle gym, constantly focused, constantly, like it's NFL football precision, that they never get hurt, that they be watched continually, because we understand we're living in the Soviet Union.
[02:11:58.626 --> 02:11:59.687]  This is not a free country.
[02:12:01.212 --> 02:12:16.305]  Trash in your backyard, you bring your kid in because the dog, you know, the kid was getting in the dog bowl, playing with the dog, pushing it back, and it snapped him on the neck, or you know, just barely scratched, but the parent's paranoid and goes in for a tetanus shot, boom, your kids are gone.
[02:12:16.605 --> 02:12:18.426]  Fall off a jungle gym, your kids are gone.
[02:12:19.507 --> 02:12:24.571]  You just, you're in the wrong hospital, they think you're poor, tell them you don't want shots, your kids are gone.
[02:12:24.732 --> 02:12:26.013]  There's no law, they still take them.
[02:12:26.853 --> 02:12:27.494]  This is hell.
[02:12:28.451 --> 02:12:30.092]  And now I'm going to shut up now.
[02:12:30.272 --> 02:12:33.393]  I want Greg Pound who heads up Free Our Kids.
[02:12:33.993 --> 02:12:36.074]  That is the website FreeOurKids.com.
[02:12:36.474 --> 02:12:37.254]  Tell everybody about it.
[02:12:37.274 --> 02:12:40.335]  It's an excellent site with all these video depositions of what's happened to people.
[02:12:41.176 --> 02:12:43.076]  He's in Florida in the heart of the beast.
[02:12:43.737 --> 02:12:49.879]  Just take the next five minutes, break down, as if you only had five minutes, a synopsis of what happened to you.
[02:12:50.874 --> 02:13:07.140]  What you're facing, what you've dealt with, and the other families you've talked to, and what you've seen, and I love when you called in a week ago or so, you talked about how you prayed to God to defend you against the CPS worker, and she got arrested the next day, but still, you haven't gotten your children back.
[02:13:07.540 --> 02:13:08.781]  But just go through this for us.
[02:13:09.461 --> 02:13:11.241]  Okay, Alex, thank you for having me on.
[02:13:12.262 --> 02:13:18.384]  What it was, was two and a half years ago, our daughter got accidentally bit by someone else's dog.
[02:13:19.013 --> 02:13:41.547]  And the sad situation is that, just a little background about me and my wife, we homeschool our kids, we work with an organization, matter of fact, homeschooling out of Texas, Big Sandy, Texas, with Bill Gothard's ministry, and it's called Advanced Training Institute, ATI program, I don't know if you're familiar with that or not, or your listeners may be.
[02:13:42.228 --> 02:13:47.451]  And what it is, is you have a congressman out of Dallas there who's on the board of that, and then you've got
[02:13:48.306 --> 02:13:55.168]  Um, a lot of different senators throughout the country who are on that board of, uh, it's an advanced training institute for children.
[02:13:55.788 --> 02:14:02.589]  And so we have to, it's like, we don't smoke, we don't drink, we don't do drugs, um, um, we live a clean life.
[02:14:02.830 --> 02:14:05.630]  We're, you know, we're striving to make America a better place.
[02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:10.051]  And Bill Clinton and Janet Reno said homeschooling is abusive.
[02:14:10.251 --> 02:14:13.752]  So they think you're a criminal because you homeschool, but get into the story.
[02:14:14.192 --> 02:14:14.472]  Okay.
[02:14:14.612 --> 02:14:17.073]  Well, the situation is our daughter got accidentally bit.
[02:14:17.691 --> 02:14:20.153]  A case manager came out by the name of Megan Gallagher.
[02:14:20.393 --> 02:14:24.716]  If you want this for your listeners, they can all look at it on the St.
[02:14:24.756 --> 02:14:25.296]  Pete Times.
[02:14:25.316 --> 02:14:31.300]  Just to verify, December 10, 2004, she was arrested for falsifying 26 cases prior to our case.
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:45.449]  But the whole system, after two and a half years of being caught into this situation, and trying to ask why these people refuse to give us our kids back, putting us in parenting classes where we've got to teach our kids about being homosexual, lesbian, gay, and bisexual at five and six years old,
[02:14:45.936 --> 02:14:47.877]  They've been to the doctors now over a hundred times.
[02:14:47.897 --> 02:14:50.880]  They're laundering our children for this money, Medicaid money.
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:52.401]  And just going on and on.
[02:14:52.421 --> 02:14:54.963]  They plan on terminating our rights in May to our children.
[02:14:55.623 --> 02:14:57.845]  And they have nothing on us.
[02:14:57.885 --> 02:14:59.606]  This is why it's gone on for two and a half years.
[02:14:59.646 --> 02:15:00.947]  They have no charges against us.
[02:15:01.383 --> 02:15:03.104]  But they're refusing to give us our kids back.
[02:15:03.144 --> 02:15:06.766]  But it's not only our family, it's families all over the state of Florida.
[02:15:06.786 --> 02:15:12.389]  I mean, it's a massive problem that we have where these people are laundering children for federal grant money.
[02:15:12.469 --> 02:15:14.110]  I mean, their budget was $24 million, 2005.
[02:15:14.150 --> 02:15:14.850]  And for 2006, it's $28 million.
[02:15:20.568 --> 02:15:25.491]  And it's just a shame that these people are receiving money from the federal government to come in and destroy the families.
[02:15:25.571 --> 02:15:30.174]  Now let's go through this blow-by-blow because it's admitted they're setting kids up here.
[02:15:30.254 --> 02:15:34.016]  Kids go to juvenile hall now for a couple absences because they rig it.
[02:15:34.977 --> 02:15:39.059]  They scream at the parents, scream at them until they sign them over and then they're gone.
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:44.643]  They get raped, they get tortured, they get kept in longer than they're supposed to be here in Texas and then
[02:15:46.093 --> 02:15:46.994]  It just continues.
[02:15:47.034 --> 02:15:51.577]  This lady's been arrested for falsifying cases, but do they release all the kids that were grabbed by her?
[02:15:51.918 --> 02:15:52.178]  No!
[02:15:53.579 --> 02:15:54.420]  No, not at all.
[02:15:54.680 --> 02:15:58.703]  Well, that's why, you know, Alex, I'm just trying to figure out why nothing's being done.
[02:15:59.083 --> 02:16:06.869]  I don't understand why America... I mean, I've actually tried to call all the mothers... Sir, I'm not trying to scare you, but have you seen your children?
[02:16:06.889 --> 02:16:09.331]  Some of them, you know, 3,000 are missing.
[02:16:09.732 --> 02:16:11.573]  There may be a reason you're not getting your children back.
[02:16:11.993 --> 02:16:12.634]  Oh, no, I know that.
[02:16:12.674 --> 02:16:14.155]  I believe my children have been molested.
[02:16:14.175 --> 02:16:15.116]  There's signs of it.
[02:16:15.586 --> 02:16:20.531]  And what happens is the reason is, and that's why I only see my kids two hours a month.
[02:16:20.611 --> 02:16:22.533]  When I see my kids, I see them acting out things.
[02:16:22.953 --> 02:16:28.278]  When my kids tell me they're seeing pictures of people with no clothes on, that's the end, it tells me right there.
[02:16:28.318 --> 02:16:33.984]  And then the poor people that are standing there at this one hour visit tells my kids they can't talk about it and stuff like this.
[02:16:34.404 --> 02:16:36.065]  Yeah, I mean it's real simple.
[02:16:36.165 --> 02:16:39.468]  You've got pedophile rings that get to go kidnap your kids.
[02:16:39.528 --> 02:16:40.288]  I mean, it's real simple.
[02:16:40.729 --> 02:16:43.971]  Okay, but what I'm just saying is, why is America, why is this going on?
[02:16:44.131 --> 02:16:45.012]  Because we're scum.
[02:16:45.052 --> 02:16:46.853]  We're a demon-possessed nation.
[02:16:47.734 --> 02:16:50.356]  It's real simple.
[02:16:50.836 --> 02:16:52.658]  I mean, it's just like in Sodom and Gomorrah.
[02:16:52.858 --> 02:16:55.059]  They came to the door and told Lot, give us your children.
[02:16:55.900 --> 02:16:56.100]  Right.
[02:16:56.420 --> 02:16:57.121]  That's what they do.
[02:16:57.401 --> 02:16:58.082]  And that's what they did.
[02:16:58.102 --> 02:16:59.242]  They took our kids by force.
[02:17:00.063 --> 02:17:01.884]  I want you to describe how they took them.
[02:17:01.904 --> 02:17:02.565]  Tell us about that.
[02:17:03.231 --> 02:17:13.014]  Well, the sad situation is, is what happens is, um, my wife stayed at the hospital all night with our daughter, and I brought the three kids to the hospital the next day, and that's when they came in and took the kids.
[02:17:13.655 --> 02:17:16.195]  Um, they didn't show me a warrant or a pickup order.
[02:17:16.516 --> 02:17:18.416]  They said they had one, but they didn't produce it.
[02:17:19.036 --> 02:17:27.159]  And, um, the officer, I asked the officer, I said, if you were, if you were a German soldier and I was a Jew, would you, and they told you to shoot me, would you do that?
[02:17:27.899 --> 02:17:29.320]  This is what the officer told me, he says,
[02:17:30.895 --> 02:17:34.161]  When they tell me to jump, all I do is ask them how high.
[02:17:35.243 --> 02:17:38.749]  And he said, I've got a wife and I've got a family that I have to provide for.
[02:17:38.910 --> 02:17:39.751]  Yeah, he's scum.
[02:17:39.771 --> 02:17:40.593]  He's going to hell.
[02:17:40.633 --> 02:17:42.035]  There's absolutely no doubt about it.
[02:17:42.336 --> 02:17:42.977]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:43.037 --> 02:17:43.378]  Stay there.
[02:17:46.974 --> 02:17:51.477]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:51.818 --> 02:17:55.901]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.201 --> 02:17:56.741]  We listened.
[02:17:57.061 --> 02:18:02.045]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.305 --> 02:18:02.806]  We listened.
[02:18:03.186 --> 02:18:06.228]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:06.649 --> 02:18:07.169]  We listened.
[02:18:07.629 --> 02:18:11.693]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.073 --> 02:18:12.574]  We listened.
[02:18:12.914 --> 02:18:18.159]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.579 --> 02:18:19.921]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.281 --> 02:18:21.822]  Introducing the Berkey Light.

[02:19:45.111 --> 02:19:47.572]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.132 --> 02:20:02.195]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion, and establish a world government?
[02:20:02.836 --> 02:20:12.138]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:19.512 --> 02:20:19.992]  It's free.
[02:20:20.032 --> 02:20:22.233]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:20:44.889 --> 02:20:51.372]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:20:51.612 --> 02:20:55.653]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:20:55.894 --> 02:20:58.055]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:20:58.395 --> 02:21:05.358]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:21:05.738 --> 02:21:08.340]  Non-X nail gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:21:08.601 --> 02:21:12.123]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:21:12.384 --> 02:21:20.270]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:21:20.671 --> 02:21:22.132]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:21:22.432 --> 02:21:25.875]  You'll find Non-X gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X,
[02:21:26.335 --> 02:21:32.736]  The federal government paying bounties on children's heads is accelerating the abduction of children.
[02:21:32.776 --> 02:21:33.377]  There's no due process.
[02:21:55.857 --> 02:21:57.099]  It's run by pedophiles.
[02:21:58.441 --> 02:22:02.446]  It's the only Greek you can get to go around grabbing innocent children from innocent families.
[02:22:04.088 --> 02:22:09.035]  See, in the past, if there was criminal evidence of serious abuse, then it was a criminal matter.
[02:22:10.484 --> 02:22:14.045]  We've got all these major TV movies and stuff about all the abuse that's going on.
[02:22:14.305 --> 02:22:16.066]  The real abuse is the government.
[02:22:16.526 --> 02:22:20.967]  Now, we were just talking to Greg Pound, who had his children kidnapped two and a half years ago.
[02:22:20.987 --> 02:22:23.348]  They're about to permanently terminate his rights to them.
[02:22:23.688 --> 02:22:28.710]  He's been to jail for not giving up the new baby to these creeps.
[02:22:29.250 --> 02:22:31.350]  You're in Pinellas County, where they killed Shivo.
[02:22:31.810 --> 02:22:32.991]  You were just talking about all that.
[02:22:33.131 --> 02:22:35.111]  And you said it's like an organized crime syndicate.
[02:22:35.131 --> 02:22:36.672]  Repeat all that to the listeners.
[02:22:37.518 --> 02:22:43.980]  Well, Alex, it's a situation here where they're laundering people for money, those who can't defend themselves against them.
[02:22:44.540 --> 02:22:46.361]  The poor, the fatherless, and the widows.
[02:22:46.921 --> 02:22:59.405]  I mean, when you watch the website FreeOurKids.com, when I mentioned this the last time I was on your program, I've got more calls than you could ever imagine just from that one little segment of just mentioning it on your program.
[02:22:59.925 --> 02:23:05.247]  And what happens is that in Florida, what they're doing is just like, it's so hard for us
[02:23:05.683 --> 02:23:07.086]  I mean, we would never separate.
[02:23:07.347 --> 02:23:09.671]  Me and my wife never have been separated from our kids.
[02:23:09.952 --> 02:23:12.878]  It's either she was with them or I was with them or we were there together all the time.
[02:23:13.382 --> 02:23:21.649]  And what happens is when they, to Matt, to have our kids taken from us and they hear them screaming and crying and just, I mean, just trying to figure out what's going on.
[02:23:21.669 --> 02:23:22.049]  Yeah, I've seen it.
[02:23:22.069 --> 02:23:23.230]  I've been there when they're doing it.
[02:23:23.510 --> 02:23:27.273]  For those that, and of course they weren't my children, so I could only feel one tenth of the pain.
[02:23:27.313 --> 02:23:28.334]  It was more than I could bear.
[02:23:28.795 --> 02:23:33.539]  Literally, I was bawling my eyes out and the demons weren't smiling and enjoying it.
[02:23:33.579 --> 02:23:36.041]  They are actual hell spawn.
[02:23:36.261 --> 02:23:38.463]  You're dealing with pedophile butchers.
[02:23:39.764 --> 02:23:41.305]  Tell the people what it's like to see it.
[02:23:42.017 --> 02:23:44.780]  Well, what it is, is this is what I did to my wife.
[02:23:44.860 --> 02:23:48.684]  My wife went nine days after that experience without sleeping.
[02:23:49.104 --> 02:23:53.548]  Nine days to the place where I had to call 911 and have her taken to the hospital.
[02:23:54.049 --> 02:24:01.356]  And then they Baker Acted her because she said to the nurse, she said, there's worse things that can happen in life than death that she was explaining what we're going through.
[02:24:01.877 --> 02:24:05.779]  And what happens is a nurse baker acted her... Oh yeah, it's all set up like that.
[02:24:05.859 --> 02:24:10.861]  And then when your kids cried saying, we want mommy, I guarantee you they started trying to pump deadly drugs on them.
[02:24:11.202 --> 02:24:13.923]  Oh yeah, it's just a shame to see what they've done to our children.
[02:24:13.963 --> 02:24:14.683]  You're abnormal!
[02:24:14.723 --> 02:24:18.405]  You don't like a state that seizes your children for no reason!
[02:24:18.425 --> 02:24:20.146]  You're not normal!
[02:24:20.866 --> 02:24:25.889]  You know Alex, it's a shame that people have gotten so cold-hearted in America that they could do something like this.
[02:24:26.565 --> 02:24:27.185]  Well, you know what?
[02:24:27.245 --> 02:24:33.306]  All these cold-hearted people that do it, and all these cold-hearted folks that turn away and go, it's not my business, they're gonna lose everything they got, too.
[02:24:33.666 --> 02:24:37.167]  Does anybody think we need one safe with criminals like this running things?
[02:24:37.567 --> 02:24:38.927]  Have you heard about the state of Texas?
[02:24:39.728 --> 02:24:40.248]  No, I haven't.
[02:24:41.088 --> 02:24:44.789]  I mean, it's just... well, Jerome Corsi came on here and said it's run by pedophiles.
[02:24:45.109 --> 02:24:46.089]  That is what happens.
[02:24:46.129 --> 02:24:47.189]  These people rule!
[02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:48.269]  They rule!
[02:24:48.289 --> 02:24:50.030]  Well, listen to this newspaper article.
[02:24:50.050 --> 02:24:50.710]  It's real short.
[02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:51.970]  It says, Pinellas Park,
[02:24:52.495 --> 02:25:01.343]  It says the two brothers grew up in separate foster homes, but both say they were abused again and again, physically and sexually, while in foster care.
[02:25:01.943 --> 02:25:04.745]  One brother said he was sodomized in three different homes.
[02:25:05.046 --> 02:25:12.692]  The other claims he was also raped and forced to sit in his own urine for hours, or kept outside without food or water.
[02:25:13.533 --> 02:25:15.915]  It says they told the caseworker about the abuse,
[02:25:16.297 --> 02:25:21.927]  But either nothing was done or they were moved to another abusive situation year after year, the suit says.
[02:25:22.228 --> 02:25:25.574]  Now this is after they came out of the system being used by pedophiles.
[02:25:26.207 --> 02:25:28.248]  You have a major satanic cult in your town?
[02:25:49.016 --> 02:25:49.756]  It's evident to see.
[02:25:49.816 --> 02:25:53.897]  I mean, we just had the Largo Police Department busted for a pedophile ring.
[02:25:54.057 --> 02:25:56.358]  FBI did a sting ring on the Largo Police Department.
[02:25:56.978 --> 02:25:59.258]  I mean, we're talking about... I don't understand.
[02:25:59.418 --> 02:26:06.600]  See, we're supposed to, as a nation, our strength as men with our purity, with keeping ourselves under control.
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:12.341]  When I see the men totally out of control, this is a judgment on our nation and on the men in America.
[02:26:12.901 --> 02:26:18.242]  And if the men do not repent and begin loving their wives and their children without sex, we're going to be in big, big trouble.
[02:26:18.877 --> 02:26:23.401]  This nation, I mean, that's why they're pounding this sexual stuff on us, because it destroys us.
[02:26:23.981 --> 02:26:26.343]  It's destroying our nation, it's destroying our families.
[02:26:26.363 --> 02:26:26.944]  No, no, that's right.
[02:26:26.964 --> 02:26:28.205]  You're absolutely right.
[02:26:28.245 --> 02:26:31.508]  It is a trap, and then, and then, it's how they control them.
[02:26:31.548 --> 02:26:40.295]  Look, you're not part of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, unless they've got dirt on you, and their favorite dirt is this, because, because this evil system loves to feed on children.
[02:26:40.335 --> 02:26:45.019]  Now, we're about to break again, but tell us what it was like, how they actually grabbed your children.
[02:26:45.720 --> 02:26:53.143]  Well, what it is... It was something... I was trying to figure out what I was... There were three officers in there and I didn't know what to do.
[02:26:53.343 --> 02:26:58.625]  All I could do as I was trying to figure out whether I should explode on them or what I'm supposed to do with the situation.
[02:26:59.085 --> 02:26:59.945]  And that's what they were doing.
[02:26:59.965 --> 02:27:03.447]  They had... There were three in the room, maybe three standing outside the door.
[02:27:03.667 --> 02:27:05.047]  They took our kids by force.
[02:27:05.187 --> 02:27:07.208]  And I asked them, I said, on what grounds?
[02:27:07.748 --> 02:27:08.829]  I mean, do you have a warrant?
[02:27:09.029 --> 02:27:10.789]  On what grounds are you taking our kids from us?
[02:27:11.490 --> 02:27:12.630]  And so what happens is, I mean,
[02:27:13.186 --> 02:27:21.432]  And, you know, we're just sitting here trying to figure out, I mean, as a man... Well, I just want to pray that they all have heart attacks, they all get cancer, they all have bad car wrecks.
[02:27:21.993 --> 02:27:22.473]  And you know what?
[02:27:22.513 --> 02:27:24.435]  God's gonna, God's gonna grant that.
[02:27:25.155 --> 02:27:29.879]  I hope those guys know, and I hope all of them know, they, they're not gonna have to wait till they go to hell.
[02:27:30.719 --> 02:27:32.160]  God is gonna just, ugh.
[02:27:32.481 --> 02:27:33.141]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.243 --> 02:27:36.143]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.624 --> 02:27:38.225]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.146 --> 02:27:41.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.735 --> 02:27:46.135]  Attention!
[02:27:46.255 --> 02:27:49.076]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:27:49.376 --> 02:27:53.658]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:27:53.998 --> 02:27:54.678]  Listen closely.
[02:27:55.318 --> 02:28:02.781]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:28:03.081 --> 02:28:11.864]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:28:12.164 --> 02:28:15.105]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[02:28:15.345 --> 02:28:17.667]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[02:28:17.947 --> 02:28:27.434]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:28:27.614 --> 02:28:33.238]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[02:28:33.438 --> 02:28:37.021]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[02:28:37.241 --> 02:28:40.584]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[02:28:45.396 --> 02:28:48.978]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[02:28:49.238 --> 02:28:50.078]  Look no further!
[02:28:50.399 --> 02:28:52.980]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:29:01.884]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:29:02.064 --> 02:29:03.265]  You can order everything you need
[02:29:03.345 --> 02:29:03.786]  I think so.
[02:29:19.582 --> 02:29:19.902]  I don't know.
[02:29:47.139 --> 02:29:51.260]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:29:51.481 --> 02:29:53.241]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:29:53.501 --> 02:29:59.803]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:30:00.084 --> 02:30:06.206]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.466 --> 02:30:12.488]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[02:30:12.768 --> 02:30:19.172]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[02:30:19.332 --> 02:30:22.874]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[02:30:23.174 --> 02:30:26.877]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:30:27.057 --> 02:30:29.598]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:30:29.738 --> 02:30:30.799]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:31.079 --> 02:30:31.580]  I think so.
[02:30:55.046 --> 02:30:56.106]  Alright, my friends, welcome back.
[02:31:17.489 --> 02:31:43.836]  This tears my guts out because back when I had time and I was just doing local radio and just started syndicated radio 7, 8, 9, 10 years ago during that period we really got into fighting this locally here and the stuff I've seen I mean the falsification of reports on their face the incredible evil the people that run this I mean you've got to actually be around them they get off on the crying parents they literally it's like something out of a horror movie you have not seen evil
[02:31:44.802 --> 02:31:46.143]  And you know what?
[02:31:46.704 --> 02:31:47.945]  I was naive ten years ago.
[02:31:48.225 --> 02:31:49.486]  I thought I knew about the New World Order.
[02:31:49.846 --> 02:31:50.367]  I didn't know.
[02:31:50.927 --> 02:31:56.952]  You have no idea until you've been around these people, until you've experienced it, just how wicked they are.
[02:31:57.913 --> 02:32:09.543]  And Hannah, and Isaiah, and Joanna, and Susanna, and imagine seven, six, four, and three.
[02:32:09.683 --> 02:32:11.945]  One of them was less than a year old when
[02:32:13.140 --> 02:32:20.545]  When she was grabbed, thank God, you know, the 70-year-olds probably got, you know, that basic four and a half years of training to remember who her parents are.
[02:32:21.365 --> 02:32:23.707]  These people are directly out of the pits of hell.
[02:32:25.808 --> 02:32:31.732]  How many adopted children do the parents not know that that healthy, happy baby they got was stolen from crying parents who've done nothing?
[02:32:32.993 --> 02:32:34.854]  And that's the lucky babies that go to good families.
[02:32:34.914 --> 02:32:41.839]  Most of them get put into systems, they launder them for the drugs, putting them on drugs, psychiatric, screwing them up, and most of them end up
[02:32:42.549 --> 02:32:44.209]  A lot of them end up dead by the time they're 20, 25.
[02:32:44.269 --> 02:32:45.710]  They end up in prisons.
[02:32:46.450 --> 02:32:49.951]  They end up being abusers themselves.
[02:32:50.591 --> 02:32:52.151]  I just pray to our Heavenly Father.
[02:32:52.271 --> 02:33:06.675]  I pray to Jesus, Yahweh, to help all of the captives, all these little children, that all of the scum that has done this be arrested, that all of the scum be revealed, that all of the scum get in trouble.
[02:33:07.655 --> 02:33:11.356]  If it means the children being released, that God, you strike these people down dead.
[02:33:12.173 --> 02:33:20.276]  I mean, I'm asking you, Heavenly Father, that these are good Christian people out there who the beast is mainly attacking, who do not deserve this, and they cry out to you to protect them.
[02:33:20.736 --> 02:33:31.920]  Everybody needs to pray for Greg Pound and his wife and his little babies, who are in the clutches of the CPS worker that made up the charges, again, was arrested on false charges.
[02:33:32.340 --> 02:33:33.021]  They don't care.
[02:33:33.041 --> 02:33:34.081]  They just cover it up.
[02:33:36.074 --> 02:33:38.778]  That just means they went after the wrong people that knew how to pull levers.
[02:33:38.978 --> 02:33:42.342]  The average person doesn't know how to defend themselves or doesn't have the connections to do it.
[02:33:42.402 --> 02:33:44.064]  It's not who you are, it's who you know.
[02:33:44.124 --> 02:33:53.176]  Well, we know our Heavenly Father and I'm praying for all... I'm begging for all of you out there to pray for this man and his family.
[02:33:54.179 --> 02:34:02.426]  And you know what, if it sounds mean that I'm sitting here saying these people are going to have horrible lives, horrible things are going to happen to them, I'm warning the evil people out there, people that are getting into evil.
[02:34:02.506 --> 02:34:04.608]  You think it's fun to persecute the innocent?
[02:34:04.948 --> 02:34:06.870]  You get off on doing evil things?
[02:34:07.290 --> 02:34:08.932]  You think you're going to get power out of it?
[02:34:08.972 --> 02:34:10.833]  You think this ride is going to go on forever?
[02:34:11.914 --> 02:34:13.976]  You are cursed in this life.
[02:34:14.136 --> 02:34:16.078]  And I know this is how the world works.
[02:34:16.238 --> 02:34:17.059]  I have experienced it.
[02:34:17.359 --> 02:34:19.581]  When you do wrong, you are going to be punished for it.
[02:34:20.541 --> 02:34:25.263]  And then sometimes, you know, God's people get persecuted, like Joe, but it's a test.
[02:34:25.983 --> 02:34:27.904]  And I am just, this is so horrible.
[02:34:27.944 --> 02:34:30.205]  This man is begging God for help.
[02:34:31.966 --> 02:34:33.106]  God has helped you.
[02:34:33.186 --> 02:34:40.349]  You told the story when you called in last week that you cried out to God during the latest thing and that this witch was arrested the next day?
[02:34:41.290 --> 02:34:41.510]  Right.
[02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:44.631]  Well, no, she was, it actually happened four months later.
[02:34:45.111 --> 02:34:46.552]  Megan Gallagher was arrested.
[02:34:47.933 --> 02:34:52.136]  Um, as I looked at, it was December, it was December 10th, she started our case.
[02:34:52.576 --> 02:35:05.545]  It was after, what it was, I talked to her on the phone, I remember calling her, and we were crying, and it was, it was after that time, um, after talking with her, and she was just laughing, she just, she was laughing so hard she had to muzzle her phone.
[02:35:06.447 --> 02:35:08.389]  I know, folks, that changed me so much.
[02:35:08.409 --> 02:35:10.311]  People wonder why I get so vicious and so angry.
[02:35:10.671 --> 02:35:14.655]  I have seen them relishing horror and pain.
[02:35:14.975 --> 02:35:18.278]  There's no... It's literally like demons feeding off the pain.
[02:35:18.298 --> 02:35:20.860]  I mean, this is like a Lovecraft novel.
[02:35:20.880 --> 02:35:21.761]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:35:22.382 --> 02:35:27.386]  And so what happens is, I mean, at that point, it's just, I mean, that was a revival to me.
[02:35:27.446 --> 02:35:32.411]  I mean, then it was a... You actually talked to the demon.
[02:35:33.729 --> 02:35:34.109]  I'm sorry?
[02:35:34.329 --> 02:35:36.150]  You were actually talking to the demon over the phone?
[02:35:36.530 --> 02:35:38.110]  Yes, exactly.
[02:35:38.450 --> 02:35:43.832]  I mean, the girl was just laughing, and so what I did is after she hung up, I just kept crying.
[02:35:43.952 --> 02:35:47.753]  I kept crying to my father in heaven, and it's amazing.
[02:35:47.913 --> 02:35:59.496]  Just the stuff that has happened in this case, like for instance, someone dropping off at my front door from the court five large envelopes with documentation of what the court's doing.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:06.425]  For instance, I have right here, they ordered us into what they call a psychological evaluation.
[02:36:06.725 --> 02:36:17.774]  Now they sent us the schedule of the date and the time of the evaluation to Dr. Greensburg, and what happens, the copy that we have, Greg goes on Friday, August 27th, 2004, then my wife goes on September the 3rd.
[02:36:21.141 --> 02:36:21.541]  We're good to go.
[02:36:41.681 --> 02:36:43.022]  And then really you never get them.
[02:36:43.222 --> 02:36:53.529]  So you went to your own psychiatrist, said you were fine, that wasn't good enough, and then you find out it's all rigged, and you find out that the doctors they send you to, that it's all a rigged game.
[02:36:53.870 --> 02:36:54.070]  Right.
[02:36:54.190 --> 02:37:03.697]  The court providers, it's like the one doctor that evaluated my wife, I asked him in court, it took me a year to get him in, I said, how many evaluations have you done in the first three months?
[02:37:04.057 --> 02:37:04.337]  He said, 100.
[02:37:04.377 --> 02:37:07.119]  And I said, how much do you get paid per evaluation?
[02:37:07.159 --> 02:37:09.100]  He said, $500 per evaluation.
[02:37:09.481 --> 02:37:10.321]  I said, who pays you?
[02:37:10.381 --> 02:37:11.282]  He said, this court.
[02:37:11.869 --> 02:37:13.250]  And I said, how many years have you been doing it?
[02:37:13.290 --> 02:37:14.870]  He said, I've been doing it for 28 years.
[02:37:15.210 --> 02:37:17.911]  This judge, Judge Fleming, has been the judge here for 30 years.
[02:37:18.212 --> 02:37:24.094]  He's been operating with her through this court, running people... Yeah, Judge Fleming needs to be investigated.
[02:37:24.114 --> 02:37:25.975]  Let me tell you how you stop these people.
[02:37:26.815 --> 02:37:28.536]  And I know you don't have the money, but this is how it works.
[02:37:28.556 --> 02:37:32.177]  You get P.I.s, you start following them, folks, and you get stuff immediately.
[02:37:32.697 --> 02:37:39.580]  I mean, people that can snatch kids all day and all night from innocent families and put them in rape pits, believe me, folks, they are...
[02:37:41.597 --> 02:37:42.498]  Well, look at Texas.
[02:37:42.698 --> 02:37:44.219]  Just look at what's come out in Texas.
[02:37:45.039 --> 02:37:49.621]  That's how we're going to have to... Look, I'm telling you what, I just can't wait till we get this country back.
[02:37:50.462 --> 02:37:53.643]  Because... Please continue though.
[02:37:53.663 --> 02:37:59.646]  Well Alex, where I see the problem is, I see the problem falling upon the men in America.
[02:38:00.166 --> 02:38:06.629]  If the men in America, as it says in the last verse of Malachi, it says that the men do not stand up and defend the children.
[02:38:07.638 --> 02:38:10.741]  The Lord God is going to bring, Yahweh is going to bring a curse upon the men!
[02:38:10.801 --> 02:38:19.130]  Yeah, we got a bunch of effeminate twit men who are perverts running things with their black ski mask, attack dog, brainwashed idiot cops that'll serve them.
[02:38:19.450 --> 02:38:25.196]  And that cop, when they were snatching your kids, you said, if you were a Nazi soldier, and I was a Jew, would you shoot me?
[02:38:25.216 --> 02:38:28.139]  And he said to you, when they say jump, I ask how high.
[02:38:28.679 --> 02:38:28.900]  Right.
[02:38:29.441 --> 02:38:31.183]  Well, you know, it's just sad.
[02:38:31.223 --> 02:38:32.846]  I mean, it's a real sad situation.
[02:38:32.886 --> 02:38:37.493]  They're going to take his pension fund, they're going to take everything he's got, and he'll still worship him.
[02:38:37.814 --> 02:38:39.276]  He is a piece of trash.
[02:38:39.536 --> 02:38:41.479]  And by the way, he'll wonder why his kids get leukemia.
[02:38:42.071 --> 02:38:43.252]  That's what I told the judge!
[02:39:08.777 --> 02:39:09.218]  I don't know.
[02:39:25.523 --> 02:39:29.606]  And the court system I'm running, the juvenile court system, is run by all women.
[02:39:29.706 --> 02:39:31.907]  The state attorneys are women.
[02:39:32.027 --> 02:39:40.773]  It's the same thing here, and I'm not knocking women, but it's a certain guild of them, and they are hard as nails, and they just glow with power.
[02:39:40.793 --> 02:39:44.475]  I've seen them grind their teeth and just, power!
[02:39:44.575 --> 02:39:45.756]  I've seen them just, yeah!
[02:39:48.968 --> 02:39:51.230]  And so it's just, um... Lonnie, what do you expect?
[02:39:51.270 --> 02:39:52.491]  They steal kids all day!
[02:39:52.551 --> 02:39:53.592]  They get off on it!
[02:39:53.833 --> 02:39:55.014]  Folks, they're devils!
[02:39:55.114 --> 02:39:56.075]  I'm telling you!
[02:39:56.935 --> 02:39:58.537]  Go to a CPS court, folks.
[02:39:58.617 --> 02:39:59.217]  I'm telling you.
[02:39:59.438 --> 02:40:02.100]  You will encounter actual devils.
[02:40:03.421 --> 02:40:11.729]  Well, you know, if they could watch the website FreeOurKids.com, and you watch every one of those sites, and you watch what it does to those people that are being raped of their kids.
[02:40:12.532 --> 02:40:14.453]  You'll see the people, you'll see how it breaks them.
[02:40:14.973 --> 02:40:16.754]  Whose lawyer got shot in the head?
[02:40:16.774 --> 02:40:29.540]  Yeah, it's Stacy Plummer, she lived in a 1.9 million dollar home as an attorney supposedly defending families and she's ripping the families off while she's working with Department of Children and Family and taking people's kids.
[02:40:30.141 --> 02:40:32.922]  It's just so hopeless because they strip you of all your kids.
[02:40:33.002 --> 02:40:34.443]  Oh, and who shot her in the head?
[02:40:35.023 --> 02:40:36.204]  Well, she got rid of her husband.
[02:40:36.244 --> 02:40:41.006]  She adopted three kids through Department of Children and Family where then she was getting money for this adoption.
[02:40:41.647 --> 02:40:43.868]  It's actually, I mean, they're literally laundering the kids.
[02:40:43.928 --> 02:40:44.648]  No, I understand.
[02:40:44.688 --> 02:40:45.409]  It's a huge business.
[02:40:45.429 --> 02:40:46.309]  Who shot her in the head?
[02:40:46.689 --> 02:40:54.153]  It was, I guess, she got, she, um, separated from her husband and she had this other guy in there and, um, I guess, I guess that's how that happened.
[02:40:54.253 --> 02:40:54.553]  See?
[02:40:54.633 --> 02:40:55.733]  It wasn't even apparent.
[02:40:56.074 --> 02:40:56.774]  Shot in the head.
[02:40:56.814 --> 02:40:57.374]  Did she die?
[02:40:57.934 --> 02:40:58.274]  Oh, yeah.
[02:40:58.335 --> 02:40:58.755]  She's dead.
[02:40:59.015 --> 02:40:59.855]  Oh, see there?
[02:41:00.115 --> 02:41:02.536]  See what's gonna happen and it's not gonna be us that does it.
[02:41:02.897 --> 02:41:03.937]  You're gonna get cancer.
[02:41:03.957 --> 02:41:04.777]  You're gonna die.
[02:41:05.018 --> 02:41:05.598]  I've seen it.
[02:41:06.397 --> 02:41:08.679]  Well, you know, here's the first... Oh, I hate you!
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:12.482]  Man, these people... No, I mean, I've been where you've been, but it wasn't my children.
[02:41:12.522 --> 02:41:13.763]  I've seen them smiling.
[02:41:14.003 --> 02:41:14.644]  I've seen it.
[02:41:14.744 --> 02:41:17.306]  I mean, these... Folks, you've got to go see it for yourself.
[02:41:17.366 --> 02:41:17.946]  I'm telling you.
[02:41:18.947 --> 02:41:19.888]  Alex, let me ask you this.
[02:41:19.968 --> 02:41:21.870]  Why is it not attorneys standing up?
[02:41:22.030 --> 02:41:29.376]  Why is there not... I mean, when you have a true, legitimate case where these people lie, come in and falsify documentation.
[02:41:30.016 --> 02:41:32.098]  Because how it works in these towns is,
[02:41:32.831 --> 02:41:41.075]  They disbar you if you don't play ball, you can't even get in court, and so they just go in and it's all a good old boys club, and they just, they literally feed on us.
[02:41:41.495 --> 02:41:49.579]  And my God, it's one thing to take our houses and our money and push us around and make us show ID cards and have the cops boss us around, but snatching our children.
[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:51.680]  It's unbelievable.
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:53.521]  But you see, you see what happened.
[02:41:54.241 --> 02:41:57.803]  Now again, you cried out to God and then four months later she got arrested.
[02:41:58.223 --> 02:41:59.504]  What is she doing now?
[02:42:00.526 --> 02:42:02.068]  Well, I don't know.
[02:42:02.128 --> 02:42:05.893]  She wouldn't tell in court when it finally took me a year to get her subpoenaed and the court cost $1,000.
[02:42:06.253 --> 02:42:13.403]  And what happened is after we got her in there, I asked her, I said, you know, she said she didn't even get fired.
[02:42:13.423 --> 02:42:14.564]  She said she quit her job.
[02:42:15.305 --> 02:42:17.067]  And, um, and I mean, here it is.
[02:42:17.087 --> 02:42:18.109]  She falsified 26 cases.
[02:42:19.611 --> 02:42:21.994]  I mean, these are just the ones that they brought to light.
[02:42:22.514 --> 02:42:25.377]  And this woman comes to my house, she's got a steel rod in her tongue.
[02:42:25.858 --> 02:42:32.164]  She comes out and takes our kids, and here's this lady that's like, um, she made this big deal about, we don't have, we don't watch television.
[02:42:32.204 --> 02:42:33.586]  We didn't have a television in our home.
[02:42:34.241 --> 02:42:38.644]  She's made this big thing when you see our kids never watch television.
[02:42:38.664 --> 02:42:42.566]  They put in there in a report that this is the first time the kids have ever seen television.
[02:42:42.906 --> 02:42:43.726]  We don't watch TV.
[02:42:43.787 --> 02:42:44.787]  That's a choice we make.
[02:42:45.287 --> 02:42:47.389]  We spend time reading and going to the park.
[02:42:47.509 --> 02:42:50.690]  But now they've got your kids plugged into that thing.
[02:42:51.171 --> 02:42:55.373]  12 hours a day, from 6 in the morning to 6 at night, they sit in daycare watching TV.
[02:42:56.053 --> 02:42:56.614]  It's crazy!
[02:42:56.634 --> 02:42:58.435]  And then at night, God knows what happens.
[02:43:01.747 --> 02:43:04.189]  Well, I just, now tell us about some of the other stories.
[02:43:04.629 --> 02:43:06.070]  Now again, Florida is the worst.
[02:43:06.130 --> 02:43:09.132]  It has a 35% higher rate of snatching kids.
[02:43:09.152 --> 02:43:11.653]  That's the federal numbers than the national average.
[02:43:12.073 --> 02:43:13.954]  You've got links up on your page about that.
[02:43:14.455 --> 02:43:17.256]  And again, now you got into this two and a half years ago.
[02:43:17.296 --> 02:43:19.678]  Did you ever hear about in Florida the 3,000 missing kids?
[02:43:20.478 --> 02:43:22.059]  Yeah, I can give you a better fact.
[02:43:22.139 --> 02:43:25.461]  If you want, I can give you the website or the phone number.
[02:43:25.501 --> 02:43:27.643]  You can call the Department of Children and Family, any of the listeners.
[02:43:28.003 --> 02:43:28.783]  They could call it at 850-4-3.
[02:43:32.278 --> 02:43:32.558]  1-0-8-5-4-3.
[02:43:33.939 --> 02:43:37.501]  This is the Missing Children Department for the Department of Children and Families.
[02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:42.844]  The list that I have of these little children, a real small one, is over 630 little children missing.
[02:43:43.184 --> 02:43:51.288]  Now, when you call them, they're going to ask you, when you ask them, is it true that you've got over 600 children missing, the first question they're going to ask you is, are you a news reporter?
[02:43:51.928 --> 02:43:55.670]  And then if you, then when you answer the question, say, well, I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:57.191]  They put you on hold and they don't come back.
[02:43:57.791 --> 02:43:59.672]  Or you can go to the website... Now, now, now, let's be clear.
[02:44:01.784 --> 02:44:04.346]  600 plus missing tiny children.
[02:44:04.426 --> 02:44:06.768]  Ladies and gentlemen, they found a lot of them dead.
[02:44:07.189 --> 02:44:10.352]  Now, folks, that was even on CNN, but then it got shut down.
[02:44:10.892 --> 02:44:12.954]  And pedophiles running it, okay?
[02:44:13.615 --> 02:44:16.138]  They're probably in Saudi Arabia.
[02:44:16.358 --> 02:44:16.798]  Why?
[02:44:16.998 --> 02:44:17.459]  Why?
[02:44:18.039 --> 02:44:19.641]  Why have we turned into this?
[02:44:21.314 --> 02:44:23.836]  Well, you know, Alex, I mean, I cry every day for my kids.
[02:44:23.976 --> 02:44:26.077]  I mean, it's like I can't even look at a picture.
[02:44:26.157 --> 02:44:28.399]  I've been separated from my wife for over a year now.
[02:44:28.779 --> 02:44:29.200]  Over a year!
[02:44:29.260 --> 02:44:34.784]  Now, let's explain how you went to jail because your wife had another child, another blessing, and the demons came.
[02:44:35.744 --> 02:44:37.445]  The Ringwraiths, the Nazgul came.
[02:44:37.485 --> 02:44:38.046]  Go over that.
[02:44:38.326 --> 02:44:39.627]  That's a whole... Listen to this.
[02:44:39.727 --> 02:44:46.672]  They came out, filed... Before they can come in and take your children, they have to file... There has to be an allegation of abuse, abandonment, neglect.
[02:44:47.052 --> 02:44:50.955]  The CPI agents came out, they made another false police report.
[02:44:50.995 --> 02:44:54.939]  Now this Judge Fleming knew, she knows this is a false police report.
[02:44:55.259 --> 02:44:57.001]  She's been on this case for two years.
[02:44:57.481 --> 02:44:59.743]  So what happens is they take this false police report,
[02:45:00.419 --> 02:45:11.443]  And they go ahead and they file it in court, and what I've been now fighting with over a year, I want the Sheriff's Department to send this false police report to the State Attorney's Office, so I can prosecute the State Attorney and the Judge.
[02:45:11.683 --> 02:45:12.983]  But Jeb Bush will do nothing?
[02:45:13.403 --> 02:45:13.723]  Nothing!
[02:45:14.063 --> 02:45:18.665]  I've got him on tape, I've recorded, and they're telling me, we're not dodging that.
[02:45:19.185 --> 02:45:21.026]  We're not sending it to state attorney's office.
[02:45:21.406 --> 02:45:27.369]  I would call the Internal Affairs... Just like the state and the feds wouldn't, with every major juvenile center, giant rape rooms.
[02:45:27.809 --> 02:45:29.110]  That is mainstream news now.
[02:45:29.190 --> 02:45:30.811]  Covered up and the governor still is doing nothing.
[02:45:30.831 --> 02:45:31.131]  Go ahead.
[02:45:31.631 --> 02:45:31.831]  Right.
[02:45:32.312 --> 02:45:39.055]  Well, you know, the one thing we need to pray is we need to ask the Lord God, Yahweh, to judge this country for what it's doing.
[02:45:39.455 --> 02:45:41.616]  I mean, this cannot get... Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:45:41.676 --> 02:45:43.858]  I mean, I wouldn't blame God if he just blew the whole planet up.
[02:45:44.558 --> 02:45:47.940]  This is... I mean, if aliens were flying by, they'd say, that's a planet of scum.
[02:45:48.180 --> 02:45:48.340]  Yeah.
[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:51.582]  I mean, let's go back here though, specifically.
[02:45:52.002 --> 02:45:54.323]  So then they wanted to grab your newborn baby.
[02:45:54.343 --> 02:45:54.963]  Tell us about that.
[02:45:55.123 --> 02:45:55.304]  Right.
[02:45:55.584 --> 02:46:01.327]  So what they did is they went ahead and they wanted to come in and take the baby.
[02:46:01.347 --> 02:46:04.508]  The minute my wife got wind of it, she said, I'm not a breeder for the state.
[02:46:04.768 --> 02:46:06.189]  And she went ahead and left.
[02:46:06.609 --> 02:46:09.371]  So she got out of their jurisdiction where they can't touch her.
[02:46:09.798 --> 02:46:11.661]  And now, but they still have a warrant out for it.
[02:46:11.701 --> 02:46:13.363]  They gotta do what they call a diligent search.
[02:46:13.383 --> 02:46:14.484]  I was in court Monday.
[02:46:14.925 --> 02:46:17.909]  I go to court Monday for what is called a judicial review.
[02:46:18.350 --> 02:46:20.412]  The judge gives me four minutes to speak.
[02:46:20.553 --> 02:46:22.816]  He gives the state attorney 26 minutes.
[02:46:23.096 --> 02:46:25.099]  And I'm supposed to, I'm trying to defend myself.
[02:46:25.598 --> 02:46:29.461]  And I'm trying to ask the judge some real simple questions about what's going on in court.
[02:46:29.921 --> 02:46:37.105]  I explained to the judge, listen, I'm not an attorney, and I just have some simple questions that I'd like to ask you concerning what's going on in this court.
[02:46:37.466 --> 02:46:38.406]  And this is just one of them.
[02:46:38.887 --> 02:46:47.792]  I said, Your Honor, you and the prosecutor have taken an oath of office to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America and the state of Florida.
[02:46:47.812 --> 02:46:48.373]  Is that correct?
[02:46:48.393 --> 02:46:48.773]  Yes or no?
[02:46:49.369 --> 02:46:53.471]  And the guy thought there for a minute, because he knew where I was going, because I want a trial by jury!
[02:46:53.971 --> 02:46:56.612]  I'm asking, if you, if we have a right for $20... Oh, that's right!
[02:46:56.652 --> 02:46:57.773]  You don't get juries, folks!
[02:46:57.813 --> 02:47:03.975]  They can take the most precious thing to you on earth, your children, and you never see a day in court, no warrants, no nothing!
[02:47:04.236 --> 02:47:06.597]  It's just smiley-faced child molesters!
[02:47:06.637 --> 02:47:07.837]  That's all you're ever gonna see!
[02:47:08.277 --> 02:47:10.778]  Well, that's why if we don't stand up for our rights, we lose them!
[02:47:10.878 --> 02:47:13.280]  And the Constitution... They even stick their tongues out, folks!
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:16.681]  I've seen the CPS, they get little piggy faces, because they're always soft
[02:47:19.022 --> 02:47:19.923]  We're good to go.
[02:47:33.826 --> 02:47:34.667]  Oh, I've seen it.
[02:47:35.267 --> 02:47:36.348]  Oh, so you've seen it?
[02:47:36.368 --> 02:47:39.711]  The smiling, the little... Oh, yeah, I mean, they're sitting there, listen to this.
[02:47:39.811 --> 02:47:41.993]  The state attorney's up there with the guard in that light.
[02:47:42.013 --> 02:47:43.995]  I'm talking about how well our kids are doing.
[02:47:44.055 --> 02:47:46.076]  Our kids have been to the doctors over a hundred times.
[02:47:46.477 --> 02:47:47.918]  My son has six cavities.
[02:47:47.938 --> 02:47:49.239]  None of my kids had cavities.
[02:47:49.519 --> 02:47:52.622]  They bring us with lice in their hair, ringworm on their face.
[02:47:52.642 --> 02:47:53.162]  Oh, I know.
[02:47:53.282 --> 02:47:57.926]  My one daughter had diaper rash so bad her skin was peeling off.
[02:47:57.946 --> 02:48:02.070]  And this stuff is all, everything we keep documenting and documenting, putting it in the record.
[02:48:02.430 --> 02:48:02.991]  What's going on here?
[02:48:03.011 --> 02:48:03.751]  I mean, I'm wrong.
[02:48:03.791 --> 02:48:04.632]  What's wrong with people?
[02:48:04.672 --> 02:48:07.754]  I mean, either you want to defend the innocent or you want to hurt them.
[02:48:07.794 --> 02:48:09.836]  I mean, they are of the devil, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:09.896 --> 02:48:10.436]  It's simple.
[02:48:10.656 --> 02:48:11.637]  They revel in it.
[02:48:11.897 --> 02:48:15.520]  Now, now, now, so they arrested you for a month because you wouldn't tell them where your wife went.
[02:48:16.135 --> 02:48:18.837]  No, I didn't know where my wife went.
[02:48:19.158 --> 02:48:21.340]  I understand, but they put you in the hooscow for a month.
[02:48:21.780 --> 02:48:22.320]  Exactly.
[02:48:22.861 --> 02:48:23.521]  That's right.
[02:48:23.581 --> 02:48:25.583]  And then they tried to break me while I was in jail.
[02:48:27.004 --> 02:48:29.647]  Tell us what they did to you in the jail when we get back.
[02:48:30.087 --> 02:48:31.588]  This is America.
[02:48:31.849 --> 02:48:34.871]  This is what happens to Christians and homeschoolers.
[02:48:35.151 --> 02:48:38.674]  Those that aren't in Pastor Hagee's church learning how to worship Israel.
[02:48:39.415 --> 02:48:42.678]  This is what we've turned into and it's only going to get worse.
[02:48:48.257 --> 02:48:53.706]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.086 --> 02:49:01.678]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:09.474]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.874 --> 02:49:21.321]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.621 --> 02:49:25.084]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.564 --> 02:49:27.525]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.845 --> 02:49:31.688]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:45.183 --> 02:49:48.365]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:49:48.405 --> 02:49:52.448]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:49:52.568 --> 02:49:55.130]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:49:55.190 --> 02:49:57.511]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:49:57.712 --> 02:50:06.157]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:50:06.217 --> 02:50:07.538]  The brookie light is different.
[02:50:07.678 --> 02:50:11.681]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:50:11.681 --> 02:50:12.181]  We're good to go!

[02:51:40.850 --> 02:51:43.492]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:51:49.327 --> 02:51:50.768]  That should be your war drums.
[02:51:50.848 --> 02:51:53.569]  You should be getting fired up to fight against these enemies.
[02:51:53.590 --> 02:51:58.612]  These are literal monsters that stalk the countryside, but they do it in uniform.
[02:52:00.493 --> 02:52:02.835]  The website is FreeOurKids.com.
[02:52:02.855 --> 02:52:06.517]  FreeOurKids.com for a whole bunch of cases and nightmares that are going on.
[02:52:06.557 --> 02:52:09.718]  We've got to get our guests back on again to talk more about this.
[02:52:09.738 --> 02:52:14.061]  We're going to be covering this subject again in depth in the near future, because it's just ongoing.
[02:52:14.859 --> 02:52:20.623]  I want to give out numbers to the Child Kidnapping Command Base for anybody that wants to call them and let them know that we're aware of their evil.
[02:52:21.204 --> 02:52:22.545]  Also, how do people contact you?
[02:52:22.585 --> 02:52:23.626]  How do they support you?
[02:52:24.606 --> 02:52:35.754]  We know that this particular Pinellas County there enjoys publicly doing evil, but finish up, Greg Pound, with what they did to you in jail.
[02:52:36.675 --> 02:52:42.019]  Well, the first thing they did is I sat there, it took me 24 hours to get booked in and then
[02:52:43.214 --> 02:52:48.438]  After I went through the medical stuff, they wanted me to sign some papers, and so I read through the papers to see what I'm signing.
[02:52:48.959 --> 02:52:57.725]  And it said that they would have authority over me in case I had psychological problems or any physical problems if I got beat up or something like that.
[02:52:57.765 --> 02:53:03.309]  Yeah, they had you sign yourself over to them with power of attorney, and it's all contract fraud.
[02:53:03.569 --> 02:53:07.932]  Right, and so when I read that, I said to the nurse, I said, Ma'am, I'm sorry, but
[02:53:08.345 --> 02:53:10.307]  The only one that I would give this to is my wife.
[02:53:10.607 --> 02:53:16.611]  She's the only one that I would give the authority to make any decisions for me, psychologically or physically.
[02:53:17.192 --> 02:53:18.913]  And the lady said, well, you need to sign this.
[02:53:19.423 --> 02:53:21.785]  She said, everyone signs it, you need to sign it.
[02:53:22.305 --> 02:53:24.427]  Real fast, finish up the story, what happened?
[02:53:24.727 --> 02:53:38.438]  So either way, they came in, they took me out, they took me to a cell, this cell where it was freezing cold, stuck me in there, and left me in there like, I was in there for a couple days and I was just sitting in this cell, they had it down to like 40 degrees.
[02:53:39.977 --> 02:53:41.197]  It's America, they torture you.
[02:53:41.598 --> 02:53:42.378]  Yeah.
[02:53:42.739 --> 02:53:44.960]  And I was just trying to figure out, I don't know what they're doing here.
[02:53:45.020 --> 02:53:58.529]  And let me tell all the scum that watches 24 and fantasizes about torture and children, and that's what their show has admitted, they're even calling the new drone program after the show, the Homeland Security, when it's happening to you, just remember, okay?
[02:54:00.536 --> 02:54:01.757]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:54:01.817 --> 02:54:08.241]  The sad situation is, I had these two CPI agents, child protection investigators, under a camera.
[02:54:08.361 --> 02:54:19.549]  I videotaped the conversation I had with them, and I told them specifically that, listen, my wife left, and I don't know where she's at, and they went the next day and said, Mr. Pounds said he knows where his wife's at.
[02:54:20.049 --> 02:54:26.033]  And I wanted to present, I had the evidence, I said, your honor, I have rebuttal evidence, direct testimony from the state.
[02:54:26.573 --> 02:54:28.074]  And she refused to look at it.
[02:54:28.094 --> 02:54:28.975]  She said, you're going to jail.
[02:54:30.228 --> 02:54:31.109]  I said, on what grounds?
[02:54:32.069 --> 02:54:37.832]  And so, what happens is that... I've got so much on these people, Alex, that I've got... No, no, listen, listen.
[02:54:37.992 --> 02:54:39.933]  It's rare when the state doesn't lie.
[02:54:40.293 --> 02:54:41.894]  It's rare when... because it's not the state.
[02:54:41.934 --> 02:54:52.280]  It's privately owned corporation, run by devil worshippers, and that's what we're under, and it's just going to get worse and worse, and all I can say is buy more guns, buy more ammo, folks.
[02:54:52.700 --> 02:55:00.901]  Try to wake more people up, and just remember who the enemies of your soul and of humanity are, and just protect yourselves from these people.
[02:55:00.921 --> 02:55:02.742]  You don't want to end up in a FEMA camp with them over you.
[02:55:03.022 --> 02:55:03.862]  What about phone numbers?
[02:55:03.922 --> 02:55:11.143]  If folks want to get in contact with you, give out any contact info.
[02:55:11.163 --> 02:55:11.863]  727-319-3705.
[02:55:12.504 --> 02:55:17.064]  And you'll find all the contact information on the website FreeOurKids.com.
[02:55:17.544 --> 02:55:19.525]  So the number again, give us your number again.
[02:55:21.147 --> 02:55:21.468]  319-3705.
[02:55:21.488 --> 02:55:30.417]  Alex, I'll be honest with you, the last time I talked with you, I really, I'm just one person and it's hard for me to answer the phone.
[02:55:30.908 --> 02:55:33.189]  Because, I mean, I've got people on there now crying.
[02:55:33.949 --> 02:55:35.329]  I don't know if they think I can help them.
[02:55:35.689 --> 02:55:36.309]  I can't help them.
[02:55:36.449 --> 02:55:37.269]  No, I understand.
[02:55:37.349 --> 02:55:37.950]  It's everywhere.
[02:55:37.970 --> 02:55:39.510]  It's just wolves feeding on us.
[02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:45.651]  I've likened it to where I'm like in a lifeboat in the North Atlantic, and there's a hundred people in the lifeboat.
[02:55:45.671 --> 02:55:46.991]  It could really only hold fifty.
[02:55:47.292 --> 02:55:57.574]  It's about to go under, and there's millions of hands screaming out of the icy water, and then up on the deck of a big ship's a bunch of fat-bellied cops and bureaucrats dancing around going, We're the good guys!
[02:55:57.714 --> 02:55:58.654]  We're the good guys!
[02:55:58.874 --> 02:56:01.755]  Well, they rape and murder and drug deal and everything else they do.
[02:56:02.055 --> 02:56:03.435]  Sir, we're going to talk to you soon.
[02:56:03.735 --> 02:56:04.375]  We love you.
[02:56:04.435 --> 02:56:05.256]  We'll pray for you.
[02:56:05.276 --> 02:56:05.596]  Thank you.
[02:56:05.616 --> 02:56:07.196]  We understand you're just one person.
[02:56:07.416 --> 02:56:08.696]  We're going to pray for your children.
[02:56:08.716 --> 02:56:09.857]  Thank you.
[02:56:09.917 --> 02:56:12.257]  And to the grace of God, we've got to get them back.
[02:56:12.277 --> 02:56:20.059]  We'll have you back for another interview to find out how you get them back, because they're about to try to terminate, obviously, any connection to them and change their names.
[02:56:20.399 --> 02:56:21.299]  God bless you, sir.
[02:56:21.640 --> 02:56:22.680]  We'll be back tomorrow.
