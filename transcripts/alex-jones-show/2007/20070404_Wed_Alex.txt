[00:00:05.285 --> 00:00:05.946]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.586 --> 00:00:07.666]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:09.487]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.147 --> 00:00:10.888]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.704 --> 00:00:12.684]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:17.146]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.446 --> 00:00:21.528]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.611 --> 00:00:43.475]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:46.798]  It is already the fourth day of April 2007.
[00:00:46.918 --> 00:00:51.322]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:53.064 --> 00:01:04.115]  Coming up tomorrow there's going to be testimony in the Texas Legislature and there's similar testimony going on around the country.
[00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:33.285]  on an ongoing basis by Bruce O'Dell with US Counts the Vote co-founder and he is a expert in the software different computer systems and he's discovered a lot of the problems built into these I guess they're not problems by the designers it's problems for those of us that want to have a verifiable vote but it's exactly what it's designed for by Diebold and some of the other big companies ES&S
[00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:37.233]  Sequoia and others.
[00:01:37.273 --> 00:01:41.537]  So we'll look at election fraud here in the United States.
[00:01:41.837 --> 00:01:43.278]  And I know it's a scary topic.
[00:01:43.839 --> 00:01:45.140]  It makes you feel helpless.
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:54.727]  But we're not helpless because just 5, 6, 7, 8 years ago I would... I remember 10 years ago interviewing the Collier brothers before they died.
[00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.049]  And they'd been exposing it for decades.
[00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.193]  And then interviewing Victoria Collier, one of their daughters.
[00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.333]  I mean, you talk about this stuff and the mainstream media would report on you like you had five heads.
[00:02:08.974 --> 00:02:10.735]  You know, each one of them was a different animal.
[00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:16.259]  But now it's mainstream news, but they try to spin it.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.624]  And there is massive moves nationwide to remove these systems, and there is an awakening taking place.
[00:02:24.045 --> 00:02:29.749]  This is one of the reasons that we've seen such incredible arrogance on the part of the government, is because
[00:02:31.465 --> 00:02:36.068]  More and more of the high-level politicians know the fix is in, in many areas of the nation.
[00:02:36.448 --> 00:02:45.274]  So we'll give you a big overview and then focus in scientifically on how these things are basically designed for fraud.
[00:02:45.634 --> 00:02:52.558]  Bruce O'Dell is an information technology consultant who applies his technical expertise to his work on election integrity.
[00:02:54.151 --> 00:03:02.316]  And again, we'll go through his lengthy bio when he joins us coming up in studio in the second hour today.
[00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:15.203]  In the mean time, there's obviously some good news because it takes a big playing card out of the hands of the neocon warmongers, Achmed Dinezid,
[00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:44.834]  has given a press conference saying that they are in the process of releasing today the 15 British sailors slash British Marines so we'll be going over that report also Kuwait media warns a planned US strike on Iran in April this is out today and they're still saying there's going to be an attack sometime this month
[00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:53.437]  We saw the Russian and French reports and Italian reports of two weeks ago saying that it would be April 6th, a good Friday.
[00:03:53.457 --> 00:03:55.319]  I do not believe they're going to attack then.
[00:03:55.339 --> 00:04:08.892]  And we've gone through how the government puts this out to create the illusion that is a foregone conclusion, the condition to tickle the fancy of the voyeur and all of us to just expect the war.
[00:04:10.074 --> 00:04:11.574]  Well, I don't want to see that happen.
[00:04:12.014 --> 00:04:16.695]  I believe they will attack Iran unless we continue to expose what a fraud this is.
[00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:20.556]  But I don't think it's going to happen now.
[00:04:20.616 --> 00:04:22.457]  I think it's going to happen in the next six months.
[00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:24.577]  But I could be proven wrong.
[00:04:25.017 --> 00:04:34.639]  And again, we do have a chance to stop it from happening if we really get the word out and if the globalists put up their trial balloons and figure out that the people are not going to buy it.
[00:04:35.579 --> 00:04:36.919]  Tehran says two U.S.
[00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.060]  Air Force bombers violated their airspace.
[00:04:39.796 --> 00:04:43.800]  Russia's anxious about military action against Iran near its border.
[00:04:45.762 --> 00:04:49.005]  We'll go over all that and a lot more.
[00:04:50.327 --> 00:04:57.714]  There's new big chapters in the Rosie O'Donnell slash Charlie Sheen media spectacle.
[00:04:57.754 --> 00:04:58.195]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.852 --> 00:05:07.075]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.416 --> 00:05:09.318]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:09.698 --> 00:05:17.346]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.027 --> 00:05:25.091]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:36.917]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.217 --> 00:05:40.699]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:43.120]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.282]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.638 --> 00:06:01.438]  Terrorism!
[00:06:01.558 --> 00:06:02.299]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.482]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:08.742 --> 00:06:10.343]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.064]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.444 --> 00:06:28.011]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.051 --> 00:06:28.351]  government.
[00:06:28.551 --> 00:06:30.352]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:30.712 --> 00:06:36.637]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:36.757 --> 00:06:41.281]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:07:00.874 --> 00:07:03.296]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[00:07:03.796 --> 00:07:07.099]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:10.441]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:17.087]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[00:07:17.167 --> 00:07:21.570]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:26.154]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[00:07:26.314 --> 00:07:28.916]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of U.S.
[00:07:28.956 --> 00:07:31.718]  debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[00:07:32.179 --> 00:07:34.721]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:39.024]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:39.945]  Treasury bonds.
[00:07:40.205 --> 00:07:44.789]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:49.794]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:07:49.894 --> 00:07:58.442]  That's 1-888-8XANADU or 1-888-XANADU and ask for George.
[00:08:00.624 --> 00:08:05.689]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.312]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:17.667]  I was up on PrisonPlanet.com today.
[00:08:17.787 --> 00:08:24.470]  I noticed that Paul Watson had reposted that Boston legal piece from what?
[00:08:42.077 --> 00:09:00.656]  Almost two years ago, where one of the defense lawyers in the television drama gets up and defends his anti-war client who is refusing to pay income tax, as Cindy Sheehan is now doing.
[00:09:01.343 --> 00:09:15.948]  I guess that's life imitating art, but the piece was imitating life and there have been some real federal cases already in the last three years where people have been found not guilty of paying income taxes.
[00:09:16.548 --> 00:09:26.171]  Not in any, there's no law, no 16th Amendment, it was never ratified, there's also been losses by the feds on that front, a whole bunch of them.
[00:09:27.077 --> 00:09:30.298]  Where in the past they were basically invincible, the public's now woken up.
[00:09:30.698 --> 00:09:35.500]  No, no, there have been federal cases where they're losing just on the protest front.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.221]  But I thought that is against the war.
[00:09:41.522 --> 00:09:42.462]  And look at the government.
[00:09:42.502 --> 00:09:43.582]  This is not our government.
[00:09:43.622 --> 00:09:45.543]  Look at the Declaration of Independent States.
[00:09:46.323 --> 00:09:55.426]  Maybe I'll dig that out and babble through some of it after this piece, and we'll get into all of the world news that is breaking
[00:09:56.283 --> 00:10:04.465]  We will get into, there's just so much here, and of course take your phone calls, but let's go ahead and go to this piece.
[00:10:04.905 --> 00:10:10.366]  It's been almost two years since we first played this, and I do have to toot our own horn.
[00:10:10.386 --> 00:10:19.188]  It went crazy once we played it and got it up on YouTube, but one of the biggest clips on the web in the last few years.
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:25.683]  Thanks to the great work of one of our listeners that sent it in to us, and we got it posted, and many others uploaded it.
[00:10:25.923 --> 00:10:26.943]  I mean, that's just an example.
[00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.044]  You can do that, too.
[00:10:28.844 --> 00:10:30.665]  All of you can have just as big an effect.
[00:10:31.365 --> 00:10:32.646]  It's pretty easy to do now.
[00:10:33.726 --> 00:10:37.648]  And there's a lot of things we don't do, a lot of things we miss, because we're a small organization.
[00:10:37.668 --> 00:10:39.189]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:10:40.149 --> 00:10:41.390]  Let's go ahead and play this clip.
[00:10:46.761 --> 00:10:55.990]  When the weapons of mass destruction thing turned out not to be true, I expected the American people to rise up.
[00:10:58.933 --> 00:10:59.314]  They didn't.
[00:11:00.379 --> 00:11:16.467]  Then, when the Abu Ghraib torture thing surfaced, and it was revealed that our government participated in rendition, a practice where we kidnap people and turn them over to regimes who specialize in torture, I was sure then the American people would be heard from.
[00:11:16.687 --> 00:11:17.447]  We stood mute.
[00:11:18.067 --> 00:11:26.872]  Then came the news that we jailed thousands of so-called terrorist suspects, locked them up without the right to a trial or even the right to confront their accusers.
[00:11:27.272 --> 00:11:28.973]  Certainly, we would never stand for that.
[00:11:29.173 --> 00:11:29.413]  We did.
[00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:39.748]  And now, it's been discovered the executive branch has been conducting massive, illegal, domestic surveillance on its own citizens.
[00:11:40.109 --> 00:11:41.169]  You and me.
[00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:47.032]  And I at least consoled myself that finally, finally, the American people will have had enough.
[00:11:48.873 --> 00:11:49.693]  Evidently we haven't.
[00:11:50.554 --> 00:11:55.576]  In fact, if the people of this country have spoken the messages, we're okay with it all.
[00:11:56.866 --> 00:12:08.154]  Torture, warrantless search and seizures, illegal wire tappings, prison without a fair trial, or any trial, war on false pretenses.
[00:12:09.054 --> 00:12:11.776]  We as a citizenry are apparently not offended.
[00:12:12.376 --> 00:12:14.698]  There are no demonstrations on college campuses.
[00:12:14.738 --> 00:12:18.761]  In fact, there's no clear indication that young people even seem to notice.
[00:12:19.921 --> 00:12:22.083]  Well, Melissa Hughes noticed.
[00:12:23.064 --> 00:12:28.969]  Now, you might think, instead of withholding her taxes, she could have protested the old-fashioned way.
[00:12:29.209 --> 00:12:34.473]  Made a placard and demonstrated at a presidential or vice-presidential appearance.
[00:12:34.513 --> 00:12:36.074]  But we've lost the right to that as well!
[00:12:36.494 --> 00:12:44.461]  The Secret Service can now declare free speech zones to contain, control, and in effect, criminalize protest.
[00:12:44.841 --> 00:12:45.461]  Stop for a second.
[00:12:46.502 --> 00:12:47.363]  And try to fathom that.
[00:12:48.744 --> 00:12:52.867]  At a presidential rally, parade, or appearance.
[00:12:53.664 --> 00:12:56.445]  If you have on a supportive t-shirt, you can be there.
[00:12:56.705 --> 00:13:00.406]  If you're wearing or carrying something in protest, you can be removed.
[00:13:00.786 --> 00:13:02.606]  This, in the United States of America.
[00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:05.327]  This, in the United States of America.
[00:13:05.587 --> 00:13:07.968]  Is Melissa Hughes the only one embarrassed?
[00:13:13.109 --> 00:13:16.890]  Mr. Shaw, that's a chair for witnesses only.
[00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:20.607]  Really long speeches make me so tired sometimes.
[00:13:20.887 --> 00:13:22.110]  Please get out of the chair.
[00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.813]  Actually, I'm sick and tired.
[00:13:23.873 --> 00:13:25.355]  Get out of the chair!
[00:13:25.516 --> 00:13:28.521]  And what I'm most sick and tired of...
[00:13:30.732 --> 00:13:38.577]  Is how every time somebody disagrees with how the government is running things, he or she is labeled un-American.
[00:13:38.637 --> 00:13:39.738]  Evidently, it's speech time.
[00:13:39.818 --> 00:13:41.879]  And speech in this country is free, you hack!
[00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:47.822]  Free for me, free for you, free for Melissa Hughes to stand up to her government and say, stick it!
[00:13:47.943 --> 00:13:48.563]  Objection!
[00:13:48.683 --> 00:13:53.626]  I object to government abusing its power to squash the constitutional freedoms of its citizenry.
[00:13:53.826 --> 00:13:55.487]  And God forbid anybody challenge it.
[00:13:55.667 --> 00:13:56.788]  They're smeared as being a heretic.
[00:13:57.028 --> 00:13:58.608]  Melissa Hughes is an American!
[00:13:58.889 --> 00:14:01.609]  Melissa Hughes is an American!
[00:14:01.909 --> 00:14:04.410]  Melissa Hughes is an American!
[00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:11.052]  Mr. Shaw, unless you have anything new and fresh to say, please sit down.
[00:14:11.352 --> 00:14:16.314]  You've breached the decorum of my courtroom with all this hooting.
[00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:26.617]  Last night, I went to bed with a book.
[00:14:27.685 --> 00:14:33.089]  Not as much fun as a 29-year-old, but the book contained a speech by Adlai Stevenson.
[00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:34.210]  The year was 1952.
[00:14:35.391 --> 00:14:42.517]  He said, The tragedy of our day is the climate of fear in which we live, and fear breeds repression.
[00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:51.364]  Too often, sinister threats to the Bill of Rights, to freedom of the mind, are concealed under the patriotic cloak of anti-communism.
[00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:55.608]  Today,
[00:14:56.793 --> 00:14:58.413]  It's the cloak of anti-terrorism.
[00:15:00.234 --> 00:15:05.835]  Stevenson also remarked, it's far easier to fight for principles than to live up to them.
[00:15:10.815 --> 00:15:15.216]  I know we are all afraid.
[00:15:17.897 --> 00:15:23.218]  But the Bill of Rights... We have to live up to that.
[00:15:24.238 --> 00:15:25.158]  We simply must.
[00:15:28.072 --> 00:15:29.694]  That's all Melissa Hughes was trying to say.
[00:15:31.135 --> 00:15:32.056]  She was speaking for you.
[00:15:34.959 --> 00:15:39.324]  I would ask you now to go back to that room and speak for her.
[00:15:41.927 --> 00:15:42.527]  Alright.
[00:15:53.414 --> 00:15:55.118]  And that really is well said there.
[00:15:55.799 --> 00:16:00.369]  But it's always framed in a socialist or liberal bent.
[00:16:01.267 --> 00:16:11.712]  On mainstream television, when you see that Blue Moon rarity where they do speak some truth on one of these TV programs, it's, oh, the poor liberals, their rights were violated.
[00:16:12.212 --> 00:16:20.316]  When even their rights were violated, that is one of the smallest and lighter violations in this country's history.
[00:16:20.336 --> 00:16:26.199]  You compare our history to other nations, it's far worse outside of this country.
[00:16:27.162 --> 00:16:41.169]  And the bottom line is, government is tyrannical, government is out of control, government is abusive, government is predatory, and if you try to watch it and corral it and control it, you're going to be lucky if it doesn't run all over you.
[00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:47.573]  Now you go to sleep, you go home and go into your house and plug into the television set and drink your Schlitzmalt liquor,
[00:16:48.248 --> 00:16:50.950]  Folks, you're going to wake up in a generation of total slaves.
[00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.551]  And guess what?
[00:16:52.131 --> 00:16:53.412]  That's happening right now.
[00:16:53.472 --> 00:17:07.284]  They're moving against us big time with Pentagon-designed propaganda, with Pentagon-designed cameras and microphones and ID cards and trained, brainwashed police and prisons being built everywhere.
[00:17:07.784 --> 00:17:12.188]  And the schools are designed to induct your children into the criminal justice system
[00:17:12.928 --> 00:17:21.091]  It is so predatory, it's moving so fast now, it makes my head literally spin.
[00:17:24.332 --> 00:17:30.493]  And are they done after lying about WMDs and creating fake yellow cake dossiers and all the things they did?
[00:17:30.573 --> 00:17:30.794]  No!
[00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:35.015]  They're just getting started.
[00:17:35.135 --> 00:17:37.616]  They're just kicking the ball off.
[00:17:37.696 --> 00:17:38.816]  They're just
[00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:41.051]  Taking action.
[00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:46.553]  They're just moving forward right now with the attack on Iran.
[00:17:46.573 --> 00:17:55.815]  And they're going to use one-on-one psychology of announcing the attack as every week, every month, until they finally attack them.
[00:17:55.855 --> 00:17:57.435]  And well, we knew that was going to happen.
[00:18:00.056 --> 00:18:05.477]  And then the dollars tanks further, and the oil prices at least double.
[00:18:05.677 --> 00:18:07.778]  Every major analyst says they'll at least double.
[00:18:08.562 --> 00:18:09.222]  In the short term.
[00:18:09.242 --> 00:18:11.984]  We're talking six months of a doubling in oil prices.
[00:18:12.844 --> 00:18:15.666]  All of the inflationary things that that will cause.
[00:18:16.907 --> 00:18:18.668]  And then we'll have to watch all these saps.
[00:18:19.768 --> 00:18:24.291]  I mean, I'll see cars with huge American flags flapping, ripping into pieces.
[00:18:24.831 --> 00:18:26.452]  Plastic flags all over them.
[00:18:27.793 --> 00:18:29.314]  Shirts with American flags on them.
[00:18:29.334 --> 00:18:35.437]  People, you see them stumbling around, looking at you when they're on these incredible zombie power trips.
[00:18:36.258 --> 00:18:42.763]  And, of course, what that flag symbolizes is literally being destroyed.
[00:18:43.704 --> 00:18:50.910]  Being torn limb from limb, in gruesome detail, in front of real patriots' eyes.
[00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:58.636]  And then we have to look at these clowns, these cult members, festooning themselves.
[00:19:00.228 --> 00:19:19.376]  Like it's some kind of red badge of courage, a Congressional Medal of Honor, with these Chinese... I mean, the shirts with the American flags are made in China, the plastic bumper stickers are made in China, the toxic chemicals in your dog food are made in China, but don't worry, there's an American flag on the bag.
[00:19:19.396 --> 00:19:23.337]  I mean, it's just a joke!
[00:19:25.158 --> 00:19:28.139]  And you try to talk to them, and they don't care!
[00:19:30.177 --> 00:19:31.177]  They do not care.
[00:19:31.197 --> 00:19:34.799]  Alright, I'm going to get it.
[00:19:34.839 --> 00:19:36.179]  There's masses of news.
[00:19:36.559 --> 00:19:38.420]  I am going to read part of the Declaration of Independence later.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.401]  We've got a guest coming up in studio.
[00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:45.943]  We've got so much coming up today for you.
[00:19:47.643 --> 00:19:48.964]  We'll also be taking your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:50.304]  I do warn you, the calls are going to be brief.
[00:19:50.324 --> 00:19:51.545]  Because I want to get to everybody.
[00:19:59.753 --> 00:20:00.013]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:02.875 --> 00:20:14.144]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.

[00:20:21.189 --> 00:20:21.709]  We're good to go!
[00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.178]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[00:20:46.238 --> 00:20:48.219]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:48.820]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.160]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:50.881]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:20:50.922 --> 00:20:51.862]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.407 --> 00:21:03.269]  Hi, Ted Anderson for Midas Resources.
[00:21:03.289 --> 00:21:04.070]  It's April 3rd, 2007.
[00:21:04.110 --> 00:21:07.454]  Gold is at $662.80, and 1 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $686.25, $345.68 for half ounce, and $172.84 for quarter ounce coins.
[00:21:07.494 --> 00:21:07.894]  That's $686.25, $345.68, and $172.84.
[00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:24.029]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[00:21:24.089 --> 00:21:27.090]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:36.274]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published a long-term fiscal outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is virally out of control.
[00:21:36.574 --> 00:21:41.876]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[00:21:42.356 --> 00:21:44.638]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.119]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.
[00:21:47.519 --> 00:21:50.781]  Get this document free by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:54.564]  The USGAO has spelled it out in black and white.
[00:21:54.604 --> 00:21:54.884]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.904 --> 00:21:55.084]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.969 --> 00:22:04.011]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.652 --> 00:22:13.582]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.023 --> 00:22:21.231]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:27.422]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:46.288 --> 00:22:46.668]  We're good.
[00:23:01.286 --> 00:23:03.087]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:23:03.147 --> 00:23:04.408]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:23:04.628 --> 00:23:07.469]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:23:07.829 --> 00:23:10.590]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:11.131 --> 00:23:17.854]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:23:45.469 --> 00:23:45.729]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:24:35.978 --> 00:24:36.598]  Welcome back.
[00:24:37.259 --> 00:24:41.241]  Glad that you've joined us today.
[00:24:41.281 --> 00:24:41.722]  Thank you.
[00:24:43.423 --> 00:24:46.285]  You know, I try to read a lot of the email I get every day.
[00:24:46.305 --> 00:24:51.128]  I always print stacks of it off and rarely cover it on air, or I just allude to it.
[00:24:52.449 --> 00:24:53.049]  We're good to go.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:26.210]  this morning and I was reading the stuff that was on it and and people always demand that you address something or they always demand that well you need to address this when you've already addressed it fifty times.
[00:25:27.691 --> 00:25:40.201]  This time the person didn't do it but I should address it because they posted on my website or they posted on that stupid MySpace account that I have and there was three different things on there I wanted to comment on
[00:25:41.576 --> 00:25:43.277]  I only have time to comment on two of them.
[00:25:43.798 --> 00:25:53.265]  Number one, there was a guy who put a link up saying, Alex Jones GCN, they're owned by ABC News.
[00:25:54.726 --> 00:26:02.692]  And then they put a link to the GCNlive.com subpage listing the different, I don't know, we got three different satellites.
[00:26:05.328 --> 00:26:15.712]  And that's the big proof there that Peter Jennings has his hand inserted in me and puppeteers me from cloud nine orbiting the earth right now.
[00:26:17.893 --> 00:26:24.355]  If you have, say, AT&T telephone service, does that mean you're owned by AT&T?
[00:26:25.655 --> 00:26:30.497]  Or if you own a Packard Bell computer, are you owned and run by Packard Bell?
[00:26:31.097 --> 00:26:32.678]  Or Hewlett Packard, I guess it's called?
[00:26:33.564 --> 00:26:34.965]  After a merger a decade ago?
[00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:50.579]  I mean it's so frustrating, and the government with some of its known disinformation officers, and that's what they do in tell-and-tell pro, is they're there to make sure when you've got a website or you're posting, and about half of you do this, and it's why we may lose.
[00:26:51.711 --> 00:26:54.494]  You don't ever try to wake new people up on other websites.
[00:26:54.514 --> 00:27:01.320]  You don't ever tell them about the Federal Reserve being private, or 9-11 being an inside job, or, hey, here's a link to a great video online.
[00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:16.333]  No, you spend your time thinking you're really, really having an effect running around saying Alex won't say it's Reptoids, or Alex won't say it's Jews, or Alex won't say it's the Pope and the Gettys with Colonel Sanders, as they say.
[00:27:17.737 --> 00:27:23.161]  You know, I've been effective because I stay focused 95% of the time, and I occasionally address this stuff.
[00:27:25.043 --> 00:27:32.049]  And again, I'm addressing it so that those of you that aren't operatives, I know most of you aren't, you're just Snowball, Mockingbird.
[00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:33.870]  The government calls it Snowball.
[00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.492]  They've had Operation Snowball and Operation Mockingbird.
[00:27:37.033 --> 00:27:39.815]  And the reason they call it that is because Snowball rolls downhill.
[00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:46.220]  And originally, the original kernel was a government op, but as it rolls, you repeat and parrot
[00:27:47.097 --> 00:27:48.218]  And it gets bigger and bigger.
[00:27:49.819 --> 00:27:52.661]  And that's how this works.
[00:27:53.682 --> 00:27:55.483]  I mean, it's pure and total idiocy.
[00:27:55.503 --> 00:28:00.407]  There are only four satellites for delivery to AM and FM stations.
[00:28:00.447 --> 00:28:04.690]  And I know station owners, managers, program directors, board operators are laughing right now.
[00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:05.211]  They know this.
[00:28:05.791 --> 00:28:06.652]  There's Jones.
[00:28:07.573 --> 00:28:10.795]  Can you imagine if we leased the Jones radio satellite?
[00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:14.518]  I mean, can you imagine?
[00:28:16.142 --> 00:28:19.163]  If we leased that satellite, they would say I owned it.
[00:28:19.604 --> 00:28:21.985]  And that I was the billionaire Jones family of Houston.
[00:28:22.485 --> 00:28:23.185]  Which I'm not.
[00:28:23.885 --> 00:28:31.108]  And I'm not the 70, was he 70 years old now, Pulitzer Prize winner, Alex S. Jones, that heads up the Shore and Steam Center.
[00:28:31.469 --> 00:28:38.572]  I get emails every week saying, we demand you respond, you're a double agent, you've got a radio show on NPR, you write for the New York Times.
[00:28:39.192 --> 00:28:40.492]  I'm not Alex S. Jones.
[00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:41.853]  I have to do this every few months.
[00:28:42.486 --> 00:28:43.427]  It still doesn't matter.
[00:28:43.467 --> 00:28:45.488]  It doesn't.
[00:28:45.908 --> 00:28:47.369]  Let's say I'm Alex S. Jones.
[00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:53.452]  Let's say I'm a billionaire Alex E. Jones that owns factories in Canada and England.
[00:28:53.832 --> 00:28:55.253]  I'm not, but let's say I am.
[00:28:55.273 --> 00:29:00.816]  Or let's say I'm a real estate magnate in Ireland named Alex something Jones.
[00:29:01.697 --> 00:29:03.978]  And let's say I'm all these people.
[00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:07.173]  I mean, I've got a radio producer named Kevin Smith.
[00:29:07.213 --> 00:29:14.138]  I bet you can find a thousand people named him and you can attribute to him whatever those Kevin Smiths do to him.
[00:29:14.918 --> 00:29:18.201]  There's a famous director, a famous goalie named Kevin Smith, I think.
[00:29:18.581 --> 00:29:20.603]  You can say that Kevin does all that.
[00:29:21.483 --> 00:29:27.728]  My point is, if you're going to make these accusations, you need to check your facts a little bit more.
[00:29:28.889 --> 00:29:30.990]  And so now you've exposed that we're owned by ABC.
[00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:31.791]  Of course we're not.
[00:29:32.311 --> 00:29:34.473]  We lease a feed, one of hundreds.
[00:29:35.143 --> 00:29:36.364]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:36.384 --> 00:29:37.385]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.604 --> 00:30:02.605]  How are you feeling today?
[00:30:02.785 --> 00:30:09.530]  Well, I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.

[00:30:54.462 --> 00:30:54.762]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[00:31:02.373 --> 00:31:08.377]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:31:08.397 --> 00:31:10.418]  Globalists are concerned with what's good
[00:31:16.383 --> 00:31:16.924]  We're good to go.
[00:31:34.747 --> 00:31:35.968]  We're good to go.
[00:32:02.404 --> 00:32:03.285]  It's no secret.
[00:32:03.545 --> 00:32:09.029]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[00:32:09.209 --> 00:32:14.012]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[00:32:14.292 --> 00:32:16.614]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[00:32:16.794 --> 00:32:19.395]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called No-B-O.
[00:32:19.636 --> 00:32:27.801]  No-B-O eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[00:32:27.981 --> 00:32:32.204]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in No-B-O.
[00:32:32.504 --> 00:32:38.727]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[00:32:38.887 --> 00:32:43.049]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[00:32:43.229 --> 00:32:47.591]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[00:32:47.751 --> 00:32:51.712]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[00:32:52.072 --> 00:32:54.594]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[00:32:54.734 --> 00:32:57.555]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-599.
[00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:11.766]  Way up north to Alaska, way up north to Alaska, north to Alaska, go north for Russia's song.
[00:33:11.906 --> 00:33:17.370]  North to Alaska, go north for Russia's song.
[00:33:18.210 --> 00:33:34.540]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92 With George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too They crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.042]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:33:37.142 --> 00:33:45.170]  You know, I would rather be able to take off two weeks on spring break like my dad would do sometimes when I was a child.
[00:33:59.244 --> 00:34:07.692]  You know, drive up with a camper to Arkansas or out to Arizona and camp at different spots and hike up mountains and through the woods.
[00:34:07.732 --> 00:34:08.672]  It was so magical.
[00:34:09.153 --> 00:34:18.201]  I'd love to do that with my children right now, but I can't do it because I know that Halliburton and Dinecourt run giant child kidnapping rings.
[00:34:18.901 --> 00:34:23.547]  I know that our government is involved in drug dealing, snuff films, everything else.
[00:34:23.747 --> 00:34:30.855]  I know that CPS nationwide is more and more being dominated and controlled by hardcore pedophile rings.
[00:34:31.536 --> 00:34:38.104]  I know that they're putting poisons in our food, water, by design, and in the vaccines and cancer viruses.
[00:34:38.704 --> 00:34:39.145]  I don't think so.
[00:34:55.114 --> 00:34:57.155]  Totally devastated by what's happening.
[00:34:57.275 --> 00:35:14.305]  I have in the last three days a giant stack of North American Union news as new treaties are signed, new deals are done, as infrastructure is being grabbed left and right and just ceded, handed over to foreign corporations and governments.
[00:35:14.885 --> 00:35:17.727]  We are watching the total destruction of America.
[00:35:19.302 --> 00:35:20.503]  And it's in fast motion.
[00:35:20.543 --> 00:35:26.227]  I mean, in the scheme of just a few years in the history of a nation, that's just a few seconds.
[00:35:26.707 --> 00:35:43.058]  And in a few seconds, I am sitting here watching in horror my country being murdered in front of me, and there's nowhere to go, there's no other free countries to run to, the same mechanized tyranny, the same globalist owners are setting up the same system all over the world right now.
[00:35:43.638 --> 00:35:46.740]  We are watching this happen right now.
[00:35:48.422 --> 00:35:48.722]  And then,
[00:35:49.975 --> 00:36:02.365]  I still marvel off that article last week in a huge online publication saying there is no North American Union and saying I'm insane and evil and Lou Dobbs is insane and evil and we're just liars!
[00:36:03.526 --> 00:36:09.150]  And then they link to the CFR's proof when the CFR openly says they're abolishing U.S.
[00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:12.512]  sovereignty and running things and bringing us into a one world government.
[00:36:12.913 --> 00:36:13.894]  I mean, it's admitted!
[00:36:14.394 --> 00:36:15.675]  Even when it's admitted!
[00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.642]  The trendy types, they just deny everything.
[00:36:23.623 --> 00:36:26.044]  They just giggle and laugh about everything.
[00:36:26.604 --> 00:36:27.705]  And it's all funny.
[00:36:28.985 --> 00:36:29.966]  And it's all cute.
[00:36:31.727 --> 00:36:38.110]  And then a bunch of traitors like Bill O'Reilly and Wolf Blitzer.
[00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:38.930]  They're all sick.
[00:36:39.651 --> 00:36:41.011]  But O'Reilly's like a cartoon.
[00:36:41.052 --> 00:36:44.353]  I mean, Blitzer's all cold-blooded about his line.
[00:36:46.774 --> 00:36:47.775]  He's not as cartoonish.
[00:36:48.917 --> 00:36:51.199]  And John Gibson and the rest of them.
[00:36:54.542 --> 00:36:59.666]  I said I'd go to your calls, but just finishing up with just a few comments on my MySpace account.
[00:37:01.207 --> 00:37:03.348]  The person just states it as if it's fact.
[00:37:04.249 --> 00:37:07.612]  Alex Jones, his network, is owned by ABC.
[00:37:09.013 --> 00:37:15.418]  And they just link to, they link to, like they found some big secret.
[00:37:16.703 --> 00:37:19.304]  On the website, hey, here's one of our satellite coordinates.
[00:37:21.005 --> 00:37:26.426]  I think one of the other satellites is like, owned by TVN or something?
[00:37:26.446 --> 00:37:29.087]  And they lease stuff out.
[00:37:29.107 --> 00:37:32.488]  It's one of those big Christian broadcasting things.
[00:37:33.208 --> 00:37:36.550]  An article's been written, my God, we're controlled by them, look at that proof.
[00:37:37.230 --> 00:37:41.051]  And then there's, uh, I don't know, satellites change and stuff.
[00:37:41.071 --> 00:37:44.052]  I think one of the others, a few years ago we had a clear channel satellite.
[00:37:46.101 --> 00:37:56.390]  But, uh, they play games where you pay them to lease the satellite feed, but then they won't unlock the key on the receivers at the station who's on a Clear Channel program.
[00:37:56.590 --> 00:37:59.192]  They don't tell you that when you go buy a Clear Channel feed.
[00:37:59.693 --> 00:38:01.074]  You've only got four choices.
[00:38:03.596 --> 00:38:05.758]  We've got the Christian Broadcasting thing.
[00:38:05.778 --> 00:38:07.019]  That's a TV satellite.
[00:38:07.941 --> 00:38:10.042]  So we can jury-rig stuff at stations.
[00:38:10.582 --> 00:38:12.142]  And we fight to do this, by the way.
[00:38:12.582 --> 00:38:13.582]  I mean, it's not easy.
[00:38:14.062 --> 00:38:22.164]  Lawsuits, I think it was like 15 years ago or so, other companies had to file lawsuits against ABC and others to make them lease you channels.
[00:38:22.505 --> 00:38:28.166]  So you have to sue them just to get on the satellites.
[00:38:29.372 --> 00:38:41.557]  And then after others have gone and sued them, you have to pay exorbitant prices to get a feed on them, and then you get to have lowbrow twits picking up on government propaganda that the government has put out.
[00:38:41.597 --> 00:38:42.377]  They have put that out.
[00:38:44.018 --> 00:38:45.198]  And they're COINTELPRO ops.
[00:38:46.399 --> 00:38:51.841]  And then I have to watch you, and again, I'm not even addressing this because your attack on me has been effective.
[00:38:52.481 --> 00:38:54.422]  The Fed's attack on me has been effective.
[00:38:54.442 --> 00:38:55.002]  It hasn't been.
[00:38:55.808 --> 00:38:59.150]  What it's been effective at is helping the New World Order.
[00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:20.322]  What it's been effective at is ensuring that instead of you going out and reaching out to people and saying, hey, check out Loose Change 2nd Edition, check out Terror Storm, check out America Freedom to Fascism on Google Video, or hey, buying a DVD of Terror Storm, making copies of it.
[00:39:20.822 --> 00:39:24.564]  Instead, you're never going to do that.
[00:39:25.544 --> 00:39:26.185]  God forbid.
[00:39:26.245 --> 00:39:45.298]  You're just going to talk about how you're at the higher level of understanding the New World Order, and then there's some other twit on there saying I'm a co-adjunct agitator, some such baloney, you know, I'm working for the Catholic Assassins, the classic bull put out by the government ops.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.302]  It's total, total, total made-up garbage.
[00:39:54.474 --> 00:39:56.995]  There was a Catholic church when I was a kid down the street.
[00:39:57.536 --> 00:40:00.337]  I remember my parents went to it one time when I was little.
[00:40:00.357 --> 00:40:02.158]  I remember just going, oh what's that like?
[00:40:02.178 --> 00:40:02.639]  Down the street.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:12.104]  I have a memory of going to another church and a guy with a beard and long hair was playing a guitar and I thought he was Jesus.
[00:40:12.884 --> 00:40:13.545]  I was about three.
[00:40:13.585 --> 00:40:18.247]  I think that was some liberal hippie church or something.
[00:40:19.948 --> 00:40:20.889]  It doesn't matter.
[00:40:22.114 --> 00:40:48.134]  It's just I sit here and I see that and then there was some other guy who spams all over my MySpace account who puts, you know, US, Navy, that's his insignia, his little chevron, his little tag picture is that, his logo, his signet, whatever you want to call it, his standard, his shingle, his billboard.
[00:40:48.154 --> 00:40:51.757]  Alright, I'm obnoxious with that semantical lexicon behavior.
[00:40:56.976 --> 00:41:05.358]  You go to his site and it plays the Navy hymn, which was good in John Paul Jones' day.
[00:41:05.538 --> 00:41:08.058]  It's not very good today, my friend.
[00:41:08.078 --> 00:41:12.459]  It's not owned by us, not run by us.
[00:41:12.539 --> 00:41:18.941]  The head of the Navy War College says you work for Wall Street and foreign banks and says you work for the New World Order.
[00:41:19.161 --> 00:41:20.721]  Of course, you're not going to actually read
[00:41:21.804 --> 00:41:23.208]  Navy War College documents.
[00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:26.277]  No, you're going to sit there and shoot your mouth off at me.
[00:41:30.111 --> 00:41:34.555]  You don't sit around watching two hour C-SPAN presentations by Thomas Barnett.
[00:41:34.835 --> 00:41:47.286]  You don't have Barnett snickering and hissing at you on the other end of the phone when you call him and saying that we're going to be defeated when I say America's going to win and he tells me keep dreaming and hisses at me over the telephone.
[00:41:47.487 --> 00:41:54.373]  I mean, I've had them hiss at me over the telephone when I say America's going to win and then the person hisses and says keep on dreaming.
[00:41:56.889 --> 00:41:59.812]  I've had them... I've had the New World Order come to me and offer to pay me off, folks.
[00:42:00.032 --> 00:42:01.373]  That's how real this is, okay?
[00:42:02.334 --> 00:42:05.977]  I've had them beat me down in the parking lot and tell me to shut up or I'm dead next time.
[00:42:06.538 --> 00:42:07.138]  Okay, punk?
[00:42:07.959 --> 00:42:11.722]  And he goes on the website every day and he spams it and we're going to ban him because of that.
[00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:17.407]  Because he'll put 15 posts up there and take the whole page over so no one else's comments can be read.
[00:42:17.727 --> 00:42:22.392]  Now, I left you up there for like a month while you sit there and you do that, but that's enough.
[00:42:23.593 --> 00:42:23.853]  Okay?
[00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:27.756]  Because what you're doing is stopping other people's free speech.
[00:42:28.097 --> 00:42:37.721]  I think it's good you're on there posting a picture of Tommy Franks with a quote, which isn't a real quote, I thought, then I typed it in and found out he really did say that.
[00:42:38.602 --> 00:42:46.566]  And Tommy Franks said, men, soldiers, go up to a man, go up to one of these anti-war protesters,
[00:42:47.587 --> 00:42:54.512]  When he hurt his girlfriend and shake his hand but then wink at her because she knows you're a real man and that he isn't.
[00:42:55.173 --> 00:42:55.913]  I'm paraphrasing.
[00:42:55.933 --> 00:43:00.196]  I thought that was a joke weeks ago when he was posting it and I went and looked it up.
[00:43:00.256 --> 00:43:01.557]  No, that's a Donnie Franks quote.
[00:43:03.018 --> 00:43:04.840]  And see, he's a black operator, folks.
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.400]  He knows.
[00:43:05.921 --> 00:43:14.607]  He hates your guts just like Henry Kissinger said your dumb animals to be used up.
[00:43:15.996 --> 00:43:17.177]  They laugh at you, fool.
[00:43:17.717 --> 00:43:18.757]  It isn't the U.S.
[00:43:18.797 --> 00:43:19.298]  military.
[00:43:19.558 --> 00:43:20.238]  It isn't the U.S.
[00:43:20.278 --> 00:43:20.918]  Navy anymore.
[00:43:20.938 --> 00:43:21.859]  Do you understand that?
[00:43:22.479 --> 00:43:25.801]  It has the esprit de corps, but that's only paper thin.
[00:43:25.921 --> 00:43:26.361]  Okay?
[00:43:26.421 --> 00:43:30.403]  That's the paper tiger facade of this lie.
[00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:35.933]  And no, the women with their anti-war boyfriends are not thinking that.
[00:43:36.213 --> 00:43:38.175]  They're thinking what a dumb idiot you are.
[00:43:38.715 --> 00:43:40.356]  They're thinking how stupid you are.
[00:43:40.696 --> 00:43:54.726]  Or they're feeling sorry about you and worried about you, because I've talked to them, hoping that you wake up and get out of there before you get shot up with experimental smallpox and anthrax shots and breathe DU and launch cruise missiles off the front of your boat that blow up innocent families.
[00:43:55.507 --> 00:43:55.807]  Okay?
[00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:58.351]  That's what they're thinking about you.
[00:43:58.592 --> 00:44:05.517]  But see, Tommy Frank says some bestial thing, some low-level thing about how you're a real man and the women want you.
[00:44:05.817 --> 00:44:08.239]  But you're probably wondering why you really can't get a good woman.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.942]  That's probably why you're obsessed with trying to get women.
[00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:16.366]  Let me tell you, once you don't want the women, that's when you're going to get the women.
[00:44:16.906 --> 00:44:17.927]  So you're not a man yet.
[00:44:18.668 --> 00:44:19.889]  And you don't understand that.
[00:44:20.329 --> 00:44:24.052]  And you're never going to understand that, probably, unless God helps you wake up.
[00:44:24.807 --> 00:44:34.032]  And so you imply we're not men because we don't go out and join a government that isn't our government anymore.
[00:44:35.352 --> 00:44:35.672]  Okay?
[00:44:35.813 --> 00:44:39.294]  That's going to become increasingly clear to you as time goes on.
[00:44:39.354 --> 00:44:41.996]  Probably too late for you though when you finally do figure it out.
[00:44:44.257 --> 00:44:52.781]  And you sit up there and you show pictures of Rosie O'Donnell next to Hanoi Jane, who I'm not a fan of what she did.
[00:44:53.553 --> 00:44:54.954]  You try to associate her with that.
[00:44:56.295 --> 00:44:57.817]  You talk about how we're a bunch of traitors.
[00:44:59.458 --> 00:45:01.520]  And it's all real cute and it's real funny to you.
[00:45:05.243 --> 00:45:08.025]  And I'm just tired of it.
[00:45:08.286 --> 00:45:19.095]  And similar people post things like, and I've seen the same bumper sticker, land of the free because of the brave and you're lucky we're here protecting your freedom so you can shoot your mouth off with your first amendment.
[00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:26.073]  The government that you support is taking free speech in the nations it invades.
[00:45:26.453 --> 00:45:27.614]  It's killing journalists.
[00:45:28.034 --> 00:45:31.136]  It's creating free speech zones here and arresting journalists.
[00:45:31.436 --> 00:45:33.377]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[00:45:35.238 --> 00:45:41.661]  Read the Declaration of Independence, read the Bill of Rights, read the Constitution, and then you can come back to me.
[00:45:42.041 --> 00:45:44.883]  But you don't know what this country is all about.
[00:45:45.453 --> 00:45:49.863]  You think it's about getting teary-eyed and playing your Navy Anthem.
[00:45:50.404 --> 00:45:50.765]  Okay?
[00:45:51.186 --> 00:45:52.669]  That's not what it's about.
[00:45:52.989 --> 00:45:54.934]  Do you understand me?
[00:45:55.652 --> 00:45:57.193]  Do you get it through your head?
[00:45:57.694 --> 00:45:58.514]  Do you understand?
[00:45:58.915 --> 00:46:19.251]  Look, if Mexico attacked us, which they have, and they sent our troops down to the border, and the President said, if there's one more Mexican incursion by their military, or one more shot fired, we're going to take 15 miles of your land, and we're going to expand our borders, and we're going to build a demilitarized zone there, because you've attacked us hundreds of times.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:29.126]  And ladies and gentlemen, if our government was being constitutional, and that's in the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and it needed help, I would go suit up right now if they'd take me.
[00:46:29.566 --> 00:46:39.813]  They probably wouldn't, because I've had a broken leg, and a really bad broken leg, and a pin in there, and bones sticking out, and all sorts of things.
[00:46:39.893 --> 00:46:42.915]  But the point is, if they needed me, I would go down there.
[00:46:42.975 --> 00:46:47.258]  And I've supported the men and men who have been demonized who were just down there reporting on the invasion.
[00:46:48.839 --> 00:46:54.242]  That's where you're supposed to be calling the authorities, calling the constabulary, is on your border.
[00:46:54.542 --> 00:46:56.564]  That's one of the three things the feds are supposed to do and they're not.
[00:46:58.325 --> 00:46:58.645]  Okay?
[00:46:59.185 --> 00:47:04.769]  And if our country got overrun, ladies and gentlemen, believe me, I'll go out in the streets and I'll fight.
[00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:06.370]  I'm not afraid to fight.
[00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:08.131]  In fact, you know, I want to fight.
[00:47:08.271 --> 00:47:12.114]  And I understand that instinct that real men have out there, you know, the instinct to fight.
[00:47:13.014 --> 00:47:14.015]  Believe me, I understand.
[00:47:14.739 --> 00:47:17.960]  But I'm going to fight smart, and I'm going to actually fight for my people.
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:19.920]  And I'm going to actually fight for my family.
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:28.542]  And that doesn't mean having my instinctive warrior instincts misdirected into supporting a bunch of robber baron scum and their banker owners.
[00:47:29.203 --> 00:47:30.283]  I am not going to be part of it.
[00:47:30.623 --> 00:47:31.603]  Alright, let's go to Randy.
[00:47:31.623 --> 00:47:33.724]  Randy, where are you calling us from?
[00:47:34.704 --> 00:47:35.824]  I'm calling from Virginia, Alex.
[00:47:36.124 --> 00:47:37.044]  Welcome, thanks for holding.
[00:47:37.785 --> 00:47:38.745]  Listening on the internet.
[00:47:40.424 --> 00:47:41.705]  I just want to make two comments.
[00:47:41.765 --> 00:47:49.410]  First, I've been listening to you for about three years, I guess, and I've noticed a difference in you in about the last year.
[00:47:50.090 --> 00:47:52.172]  You're a little more aggressive and direct.
[00:47:53.412 --> 00:47:55.153]  I guess more committed, if that's possible.
[00:47:55.534 --> 00:47:58.976]  I think it happened to you when you went up to Canada and bullhorned them guys.
[00:47:59.816 --> 00:48:02.038]  I think maybe something snapped in you.
[00:48:02.378 --> 00:48:03.379]  No, that is what happened.
[00:48:03.739 --> 00:48:05.120]  I felt like I crossed a line.
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.641]  It was strange.
[00:48:07.021 --> 00:48:09.042]  Kind of easy to tell that, but I think it's a good thing.
[00:48:10.495 --> 00:48:19.440]  I just want to say I was watching CNN the other day and it's funny how after you wake up pretty good you see it in a whole different light.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:37.010]  There was a little committee meeting with FBI Robert Mueller and he was supposedly you know going to be questioned about all these violations with wiretapping and where they're supposed to they get all these not the FISA
[00:48:37.923 --> 00:48:49.326]  But, you know, they get all these immediate little warrants to go do these searches, and they're supposed to come back with the information to justify why they got those warrants, and they're just not coming back with it at all, so it's totally twisted.
[00:48:49.346 --> 00:49:06.091]  But he was answering to Patrick Leahy, Arlen, MagicBulletSpectre, Jeff Sessions, all those guys, and it was so obvious that it was staged, you know, after you're kind of awake to it, because the whole time they're just giving him leading questions like,
[00:49:06.738 --> 00:49:09.402]  Can the FBI even handle the workload?
[00:49:09.482 --> 00:49:12.327]  Or do we need to go to a setup like MI5?
[00:49:12.367 --> 00:49:13.789]  They kept saying that two or three times.
[00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:16.533]  So it's almost like they're already working toward that.
[00:49:16.834 --> 00:49:21.301]  Oh no, listen, everything in the Council on Foreign Relations
[00:49:22.519 --> 00:49:24.900]  as well as PNAC wrote up a list of recommendations.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:51.253]  They're all been implemented or being implemented and they've already set up in many big cities a CIA liaison office and then the police chief or his intelligence head will be former CIA or defense intelligence and it's just domestic spokes and they're setting up little torture dungeons in every major city FEMA camps in every city like Pier 57 in New York or out here at the old Robert Mueller Airport they've got one in Austin which has been on the news
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.641]  I mean, they're literally setting up a good old-fashioned Soviet-slash-Nazi model.
[00:49:57.602 --> 00:50:03.203]  Well, I mean, but it's so obvious that, you know, the committee meeting that they're... Oh, it's totally staged.
[00:50:03.263 --> 00:50:09.125]  I mean, Specter will come out and say, this is horrible, you're violating the Bill of Rights, and then he'll just kind of go along and vote for it.
[00:50:09.145 --> 00:50:10.546]  Right, they're actually kind of shocked.
[00:50:10.926 --> 00:50:13.727]  You know, we're really deeply concerned about these violations.
[00:50:14.407 --> 00:50:18.048]  But it's a total joke, and it's just obvious after a while that
[00:50:18.533 --> 00:50:20.174]  That's just kind of for public consumption.
[00:50:20.395 --> 00:50:22.036]  Well, there's different layers of propaganda.
[00:50:22.296 --> 00:50:24.919]  For the general public, they'll say, torture's wonderful, it's all great.
[00:50:25.139 --> 00:50:29.843]  And then for those a little bit more awake, they'll have those little displays and, yeah, it's kind of serious.
[00:50:29.903 --> 00:50:33.906]  I mean, take all these different so-called human rights groups.
[00:50:34.427 --> 00:50:37.509]  Amnesty International, the ACLU.
[00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:39.491]  I mean, they'll water stuff down by like 95%.
[00:50:39.691 --> 00:50:45.877]  And then the other side will say, that's an extreme light they're putting this in, when really it's a whitewash.
[00:50:46.417 --> 00:50:46.618]  Right.
[00:50:47.179 --> 00:50:47.600]  Exactly.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:48.401]  Good to hear from you.
[00:50:49.043 --> 00:50:51.327]  We'll be back in the next segment with more calls.
[00:50:51.908 --> 00:50:55.094]  On the other side, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[00:50:55.135 --> 00:50:55.635]  Spread the word.
[00:51:03.837 --> 00:51:09.304]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:09.685 --> 00:51:17.275]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.027 --> 00:51:25.090]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.470 --> 00:51:37.155]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.215 --> 00:51:40.836]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.176 --> 00:51:43.097]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.437 --> 00:51:47.279]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:00.797 --> 00:52:03.979]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:03.999 --> 00:52:08.042]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.182 --> 00:52:10.744]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:10.804 --> 00:52:13.145]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.326 --> 00:52:21.771]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:21.831 --> 00:52:23.152]  The brookie light is different.
[00:52:23.292 --> 00:52:27.295]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.315 --> 00:52:27.795]  We're good to go!
[00:52:47.705 --> 00:52:50.747]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.

[00:53:00.265 --> 00:53:02.868]  Right now, 65% of Americans are overweight.
[00:53:03.028 --> 00:53:09.176]  Experts say by the year 2010, that number will increase to 75% and 35% will be obese.
[00:53:09.316 --> 00:53:18.467]  Because of these deadly statistics, Dr. Joel Wallach, host of Dead Doctors Don't Lie, has done extensive research and has found what he believes is the biggest breakthrough in weight loss in 50 years.
[00:53:18.687 --> 00:53:19.428]  It's called Slender FX.

[00:53:29.675 --> 00:53:31.736]  Finally, a weight loss breakthrough you can trust.

[00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:32.013]  Bruce O'Dell will be joining us to get into the rigging of elections in this country in studio in the next hour.
[00:54:32.153 --> 00:54:35.174]  He's going to have Vicki Karp, local election
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.261]  Transparency Activist.
[00:54:49.281 --> 00:54:50.501]  She's got the book Hacked!
[00:54:50.801 --> 00:54:53.262]  High Tech Election Theft in America.
[00:54:53.642 --> 00:54:55.743]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan.
[00:54:55.763 --> 00:54:57.304]  Dan, where are you calling us from today?
[00:54:57.324 --> 00:54:59.225]  Hello, Alex?
[00:54:59.565 --> 00:55:00.925]  Yes, Dan, where are you calling us from today?
[00:55:00.945 --> 00:55:02.806]  I'm from Australia, Mike.
[00:55:03.346 --> 00:55:04.507]  Welcome from Australia.
[00:55:04.527 --> 00:55:05.087]  What's on your mind?
[00:55:06.027 --> 00:55:11.554]  Yeah, I was wondering if you've actually caught on to the, uh, Ahmed Dinejad speech that was on just recently.
[00:55:11.574 --> 00:55:13.737]  It was on about 20 minutes ago.
[00:55:14.157 --> 00:55:19.504]  Well, I know that Ahmed Dinejad said they're releasing the British we announced at the start of the show.
[00:55:19.544 --> 00:55:20.826]  Yeah, that's definitely confirmed.
[00:55:21.706 --> 00:55:24.248]  Um, he's definitely, um, releasing the hostages.
[00:55:24.268 --> 00:55:28.950]  Yeah, they had, uh, the photos of, uh, the hostages shaking hands and everything, big ceremony.
[00:55:29.490 --> 00:55:33.232]  But the speech itself, it, like, I, you know, it was uncanny.
[00:55:33.272 --> 00:55:36.514]  I swear, like, they've seen terror storm was saying, mate, cause...
[00:55:37.134 --> 00:55:46.983]  You know, he referenced Mozadek, the overthrow in 1953, or around that time, and, you know, it was about US and BP oil interests, you know?
[00:55:47.003 --> 00:56:00.474]  He also referenced, like, the orders, or world orders, and rulers that have their own agendas, and military corporations that try to subvert Iran's, like, free will, to an extent.
[00:56:01.466 --> 00:56:04.267]  And it was just amazing, mate.
[00:56:04.447 --> 00:56:15.989]  I mean, they don't usually carry much of his speeches here, they just take them out of context, but I guess in Australia they carry Achmed Najeed's... Well, it was on CNN and BBC and Fox News.
[00:56:16.049 --> 00:56:20.831]  I've got cable over here, and it was just the direct translations as the speech was being said.
[00:56:20.871 --> 00:56:23.911]  Well, hopefully we'll record that.
[00:56:23.931 --> 00:56:26.692]  I don't think we were recording when it happened, but maybe they'll re-air it.
[00:56:27.492 --> 00:56:29.013]  Well, I've definitely recorded it myself.
[00:56:29.073 --> 00:56:30.234]  I'm trying to get it up now.
[00:56:30.674 --> 00:56:48.405]  I'll get it on the YouTube or something, but yeah, he was, you know, and they had the spin doctors on, BBC, um, just straight on, just going, oh, how can we trust Iran with, um, you know, nuclear technologies and things like this, when like, you know, Archmit Denijel was saying, well, they've been a member of the IAEA for 25 years, and
[00:56:50.886 --> 00:56:59.033]  You know, that entitles them to, like, have access to these technologies and get help from the IEA to develop them in a peaceful process, and that's what he was stressing.
[00:56:59.073 --> 00:57:10.501]  It's just amazing, like, how, you know, they're trying to get themselves into a first-world standard, and, you know, the subversion of the world order, or the new world order, is just keeping them back.
[00:57:10.562 --> 00:57:15.025]  Like, you know, they can't get up, they... That's what I mean.
[00:57:15.385 --> 00:57:18.608]  If they do attack, and, you know, this attack goes forth,
[00:57:19.332 --> 00:57:21.713]  It's going to be such a bad thing, you know?
[00:57:21.813 --> 00:57:26.035]  Well, it is a fact that our government overthrew Iran by staging terror attacks in 1953.
[00:57:26.275 --> 00:57:26.855]  That's admitted.
[00:57:27.415 --> 00:57:30.536]  It is a fact that they blew up their airliners trying to get them to fight back.
[00:57:30.576 --> 00:57:31.637]  They bombed their ships.
[00:57:32.537 --> 00:57:36.739]  They put the Shah in who had Savak torture over 200,000 people to death.
[00:57:37.639 --> 00:57:39.740]  Over 200,000 disappeared, many of them tortured to death.
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.641]  And I think Iran should be thankful for that.
[00:57:43.317 --> 00:57:46.699]  For in 53 having their cabinet's heads cut off in public.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.041]  And I think it's good.
[00:57:49.101 --> 00:57:49.681]  That's freedom.
[00:57:50.401 --> 00:57:53.483]  And that's how we spread democracy over there.
[00:57:53.783 --> 00:58:01.508]  And I think Iraq's great with now over 700,000 dead and the power off most of the time and people living in squalor and the troops never leaving.
[00:58:01.548 --> 00:58:02.649]  And that's freedom, sir.
[00:58:03.229 --> 00:58:06.051]  I mean, it's not about oil or weapons sales.
[00:58:06.471 --> 00:58:07.672]  George Bush doesn't lie.
[00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:11.415]  I mean, Alberto Gonzales doesn't lie.
[00:58:11.435 --> 00:58:12.736]  They don't torture.
[00:58:12.776 --> 00:58:16.718]  I mean, sure, they wrote memos saying they can torture children, but they don't torture.
[00:58:17.279 --> 00:58:21.801]  But torture's okay, they wrote, and they do torture, but they don't torture when they say they don't torture.
[00:58:22.382 --> 00:58:26.184]  Hey, good to hear from you in Australia, and thanks for giving us a heads-up on the latest speech.
[00:58:26.224 --> 00:58:29.766]  No, I didn't see the speech 30 minutes ago, 20 minutes ago, because I was on air.
[00:58:30.287 --> 00:58:31.447]  I do know they're releasing the British.
[00:58:31.487 --> 00:58:32.708]  That's good to de-escalate that.
[00:58:32.748 --> 00:58:33.929]  We had the British ambassador on.
[00:58:34.937 --> 00:58:38.881]  Yesterday, or two days ago, they talked about how they were really in Iranian waters.

[00:58:57.885 --> 00:58:58.946]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.646 --> 00:59:00.766]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.407 --> 00:59:02.227]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.987 --> 00:59:03.887]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.548 --> 00:59:08.229]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.729 --> 00:59:12.830]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.345 --> 00:59:30.567]  Alright, so we're going to have Vicky Karp in studio with us and an expert on election fraud.
[00:59:30.587 --> 00:59:33.208]  We'll go over his bio when we get back from the break.
[00:59:33.588 --> 00:59:39.850]  Very interesting information with Bruce O'Dell and he's here to testify in front of the legislature here in Austin, Texas.
[00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:42.871]  We'll tell you about that upcoming event as well.
[00:59:43.531 --> 00:59:47.672]  Right now I'm told out of the big call list we've got someone who disagrees so we'll go to the head of the line.
[00:59:48.052 --> 00:59:49.813]  Which one of these callers says he disagrees with me?
[00:59:50.993 --> 00:59:52.374]  Mark in New York, you're on the air.
[00:59:52.414 --> 00:59:52.934]  Go ahead, Mark.
[00:59:54.697 --> 00:59:55.998]  Mike, go ahead and make your point.
[00:59:56.318 --> 01:00:05.821]  Yeah, I agree with you that 9-11 was an inside job, but I disagree that classical demolition charges were the only thing that brought the towers down.
[01:00:06.281 --> 01:00:21.706]  I thoroughly believe, and the reason I believe that molten pools of steel that were in the basement, still molten actual steel pools, four months after in December down there, I thoroughly believe there was a nuclear device in there.
[01:00:22.458 --> 01:00:22.858]  Thoroughly.
[01:00:23.058 --> 01:00:23.499]  Two of them.
[01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:24.459]  In both towers.
[01:00:25.259 --> 01:00:37.045]  Well, we actually on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com have a link to a scientist in the UK who got some of the published government readings and is pointing towards that.
[01:00:37.725 --> 01:00:39.126]  And who knows?
[01:00:39.146 --> 01:00:41.607]  I mean, there is some evidence towards that.
[01:00:42.127 --> 01:00:46.870]  I thought you were going to talk about x-ray lasers from Pluto or something.
[01:00:47.070 --> 01:00:47.970]  No, nothing like that.
[01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:49.451]  And I agree with everything you say.
[01:00:50.422 --> 01:01:02.669]  I just don't understand what could make molten pools of steel stay superheated like that four months after the initial attack itself, the initial collapse, I mean.
[01:01:03.809 --> 01:01:06.891]  I believe it was two and a half to three months.
[01:01:06.911 --> 01:01:08.112]  That's still a very long time.
[01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:08.932]  Thank you for your time.
[01:01:08.952 --> 01:01:10.193]  Hey, thank you.
[01:01:10.293 --> 01:01:12.414]  I've been talking about the molten steel.
[01:01:13.352 --> 01:01:39.493]  uh... at twenty five twenty seven hundred degrees for almost three months after the nine eleven attacks with jet fuel it burns at a maximum of eighteen hundred degrees and you had uh... cold uh... fires uh... your red fires uh... with black smoke and you had people standing next to four foot around support beams for twenty minutes waving for help who didn't melt their skin didn't burn but the giant pillars they say melted now first thing was that they melted
[01:01:40.053 --> 01:01:41.254]  No, I don't think so.
[01:02:03.927 --> 01:02:11.933]  There's a lot of serious issues there, and that's all Rosie O'Donnell has been doing, is asking the question and saying, how did this happen?
[01:02:11.973 --> 01:02:13.855]  And they're calling for her arrest.
[01:02:14.275 --> 01:02:17.558]  Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is financing a film about it.
[01:02:17.918 --> 01:02:18.519]  His arrest.
[01:02:19.379 --> 01:02:22.422]  They're calling for her to be hung for treason and killed.
[01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:26.345]  And that was MSNBC on Scarborough Country.
[01:02:26.385 --> 01:02:27.186]  We played those clips.
[01:02:27.836 --> 01:02:29.518]  And that's because they're losing the debate.
[01:02:29.838 --> 01:02:32.200]  You know, they lied about WMDs premeditatedly.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:36.083]  They lied about so many things that now people don't believe them on other issues.
[01:02:36.524 --> 01:02:38.325]  And they're just going to have to face the music on that.
[01:02:39.146 --> 01:02:45.251]  And the bottom line is they've only got about 25% maximum support for the Iraq War now.
[01:02:45.652 --> 01:02:47.854]  They have about as much support for the Iran War.
[01:02:48.774 --> 01:02:49.575]  But they don't care.
[01:02:50.036 --> 01:02:51.277]  They want to go forward with this.
[01:02:52.218 --> 01:02:53.379]  Really, it's a Ponzi scheme.
[01:02:53.779 --> 01:02:54.940]  They're in so much trouble.
[01:02:55.552 --> 01:03:00.415]  For things that they have previously done, it's kind of a catch-22.
[01:03:00.435 --> 01:03:11.563]  They're going to end up going to prison for some of the things they've done, or there's going to be indictments, there have been indictments, there's other investigations going on, and they'll probably get them for something small, like the U.S.
[01:03:11.603 --> 01:03:16.406]  Attorneys, small compared to some of the other things, or lying to Congress,
[01:03:17.486 --> 01:03:27.751]  Or, you know, Enron connections, all these things bubbling back up, or Bernard Carrick right now has been indicted for lying, you know, in Congress when he was wanting to become Homeland Security Director.
[01:03:29.032 --> 01:03:35.355]  So they kind of need a big war to get back in that position of, we're in a war, an expanded war, you can't question us.
[01:03:35.675 --> 01:03:42.218]  It's kind of like Hitler got in trouble on his front against England in North Africa, so he turns east against Russia.
[01:03:42.771 --> 01:03:49.774]  Well, you're seeing that same desperate gamble to puff the... Either the Ponzi scheme gets bigger, or it implodes.
[01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:51.755]  Our guest in studio on the other side.
[01:03:52.836 --> 01:03:58.498]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:58.818 --> 01:04:00.739]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:01.119 --> 01:04:08.723]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.457 --> 01:04:16.521]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.921 --> 01:04:28.347]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:32.309]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:34.551]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:38.653]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:54.681]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:55.002 --> 01:04:57.783]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:58.063 --> 01:05:02.226]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:02.646 --> 01:05:03.486]  So what do you do?
[01:05:03.786 --> 01:05:08.369]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:10.971]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:11.452 --> 01:05:26.166]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:05:51.624 --> 01:05:56.407]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.
[01:05:56.627 --> 01:06:00.610]  Providing for our own food, water, and power are a good start.
[01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:07.174]  As you may have heard by now, Ken's Solar has been configuring alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:06:07.414 --> 01:06:11.797]  One of Ken's most popular items right now is the new solar-powered generator.
[01:06:11.977 --> 01:06:17.261]  For a lot less than you'd expect, this portable system can chop up nearly a third of your electric bill.
[01:06:17.541 --> 01:06:23.044]  Getting yourself onto solar power is one of the most liberating things you can do for yourself and your family.

[01:06:53.077 --> 01:06:55.257]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:55.737 --> 01:06:58.558]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:14.022 --> 01:07:17.071]  Well, she's written hack high-tech election theft in America.
[01:07:17.091 --> 01:07:22.165]  11 experts exposed the truth and it was edited by Abby.
[01:07:22.919 --> 01:07:24.960]  Waldman Delosier and Vicki Karp.
[01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:26.681]  Vicki Karp is in studio with us.
[01:07:26.721 --> 01:07:29.002]  We carry the book, Hacked!
[01:07:29.062 --> 01:07:35.165]  High Tech Election Theft in America, on the online video and bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[01:07:35.185 --> 01:07:41.809]  I hope you get it because to really understand election fraud in the United States is to understand the big picture.
[01:07:42.129 --> 01:07:49.073]  And yes, it's daunting, it's scary, it's hard to believe, but it's systematic and it's going on with military precision.
[01:07:49.693 --> 01:07:51.594]  And joining us is Bruce O'Dell.
[01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:54.939]  And his biography is lengthy.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:07.750]  It's probably better than just reading all of the work you've done in Control Data Corporation on research and development of artificial intelligence, robot vision systems, and satellite imagery analysis.
[01:08:08.682 --> 01:08:23.194]  And, you know, all the other large-scale computer systems with stringent security, audit, and accountability requirements, and some of the major companies like General Motors and many others, American Express, that you've been a lead software architect for.
[01:08:24.034 --> 01:08:25.696]  I need to get you for some of my IT stuff.
[01:08:26.156 --> 01:08:28.978]  If I couldn't afford you, though.
[01:08:29.999 --> 01:08:37.425]  Just explain to us, in a nutshell, your background and then how you woke up to what's happening with our elections, Bruce.
[01:08:38.675 --> 01:08:56.124]  Well, my background is mostly in the financial services industry and I've spent my career basically being responsible for protecting billions, even trillions of dollars of other people's money and people tend to get touchy about their own money and insist that you protect it properly.
[01:08:56.665 --> 01:09:05.029]  The mindset that I bring to analyzing the security issues around elections is, I think, completely different than a lot of my academic colleagues.
[01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:06.310]  A number of them
[01:09:07.530 --> 01:09:13.394]  Make a very comfortable living consulting for or working with the electronic voting industry.
[01:09:14.055 --> 01:09:23.462]  I'm self-employed and have no agenda and no one can make me do or say anything that I don't think is appropriate or true.
[01:09:24.623 --> 01:09:35.531]  So I first became concerned about electronic voting issues shortly after the 2000 election when I saw all of the problems that occurred, particularly with punch card voting in Florida.
[01:09:35.611 --> 01:09:36.572]  It was clear that
[01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:43.623]  The exit polls in Florida, which initially indicated Gore had carried the state, later were reversed.
[01:09:43.683 --> 01:09:47.365]  And they've always been accurate in the past, but this time they said, oh, never mind those.
[01:09:47.645 --> 01:09:53.747]  Well, yeah, actually, as it turns out, up until 1990, for a period of at least 20 years, 15 to 20 years,
[01:09:56.048 --> 01:09:58.270]  Uh, exit polls were routinely accurate.
[01:09:58.290 --> 01:10:02.854]  There was only one case that was caught and not publicly disclosed in the 1990s.
[01:10:02.974 --> 01:10:07.538]  It's never been officially admitted what that one error in the 1990s was.
[01:10:07.658 --> 01:10:10.720]  I suspect it may have been the surprising
[01:10:12.121 --> 01:10:18.902]  And totally unexpected upset victory of Chuck Hagel in Nebraska beating the popular incumbent Governor Ben Nelson for U.S.
[01:10:18.942 --> 01:10:19.202]  Senate.
[01:10:19.262 --> 01:10:29.004]  And of course he lied and said that he didn't own any stock in the company and it turned out he was one of the prime controllers of the voting machine company that what, 80% of the ballots were cast wrong?
[01:10:29.945 --> 01:10:34.605]  Exactly, he never disclosed that, in fact not until shortly after his re-election in 2002 with 83% of the vote.
[01:10:39.507 --> 01:10:44.430]  So, clearly, exit polls were historically very accurate.
[01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:46.872]  They were a tool that are used elsewhere around the world.
[01:10:46.912 --> 01:10:52.135]  So if I owned a voting machine company, I could automatically become a senator if I could just get it put in my district?
[01:10:52.815 --> 01:10:57.538]  Well, you know, that certainly is a reasonable conclusion to draw.
[01:10:58.999 --> 01:11:06.464]  None of this can be proven, unfortunately, to the degree necessary to convict someone in a court of law, at least not yet.
[01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:21.637]  But the individual pattern of the facts, the more you look at them, the pattern of facts is highly consistent with a, I would say, a long-term covert campaign to systematically subvert electronic voting in America.
[01:11:23.004 --> 01:11:23.645]  Unbelievable.
[01:11:24.746 --> 01:11:31.855]  I've been following this for about 12-13 years on air, and there's the old classic ballot box stuffing.
[01:11:31.895 --> 01:11:32.816]  Republicans have done it.
[01:11:33.196 --> 01:11:34.197]  Democrats have done it.
[01:11:35.038 --> 01:11:39.263]  LBJ got into Congress right here in Texas, down the road, stuffing the ballot box.
[01:11:39.304 --> 01:11:40.004]  That's admitted.
[01:11:40.525 --> 01:11:41.827]  Kennedy stole Chicago.
[01:11:43.367 --> 01:11:49.730]  By the way, even so, Kennedy still would have been elected President.
[01:11:50.190 --> 01:11:52.831]  Nixon was no saint.
[01:11:52.851 --> 01:11:57.453]  The only reason he didn't contest the election is he knew he had his own set of states that were equally suspect.
[01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:01.455]  In the past, it was localized, it was sporadic.
[01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:04.756]  Due to technology.
[01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:18.543]  See, for the first time in history, you can have one or very few individuals alter the master copy of voting software that gets copied out to thousands, tens of thousands, potentially hundreds of thousands of devices.
[01:12:19.409 --> 01:12:31.755]  And, you know, some of my colleagues that support electronic voting are saying, well, there's absolutely no way that a hacker could compromise these systems, but they totally obscure, miss the point that the threat isn't from hackers.
[01:12:31.795 --> 01:12:34.396]  It's not from outsiders, although there's plenty of
[01:12:35.114 --> 01:12:42.443]  Security flaws in the existing machines that seem intended to allow county election officials a little bit of leeway with the vote totals.
[01:12:43.745 --> 01:12:45.146]  But that to one side.
[01:12:46.728 --> 01:12:52.816]  You can have one or a few people change the outcome or the programming of thousands of machines and that's unique.
[01:12:52.856 --> 01:12:54.658]  That's the first time it's been possible to do that.
[01:12:54.778 --> 01:12:59.702]  That's what always frustrates me about watching the television news or reading the headline.
[01:12:59.782 --> 01:13:01.023]  Hackers could get in.
[01:13:01.603 --> 01:13:10.290]  No, we're worried about the very corporations, many of which are openly saying, I swear that I will deliver the electoral votes in Ohio to your lordship.
[01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:13.532]  And it's the director of Diebold.
[01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:16.935]  And then lo and behold, we see massive fraud in Ohio.
[01:13:17.921 --> 01:13:21.862]  I mean, this is so obvious, and it's blatant.
[01:13:21.882 --> 01:13:42.446]  And then we've had, like, engineers, as you know, at different companies, go public and say, listen, they said they wanted to hire me to steal elections, or hire me to design this where it could be hacked or taken over, and then they... I mean, let's go back, because I know I'm digressing here, or actually going down rabbit trails and jumping ahead at the same time.
[01:13:44.429 --> 01:13:44.869]  I think so.
[01:14:07.182 --> 01:14:18.147]  You know, really billions of transactions, globally a day, with these ATMs and other financial systems, probably tens of billions, and there's not a lot of problems.
[01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:23.830]  But then, with these other systems, there's always, quote, problems, special teams coming in, weird wireless systems.
[01:14:23.850 --> 01:14:28.232]  They say, you can't look under the hood, even the government can't, you know, see what's involved here.
[01:14:28.252 --> 01:14:30.233]  So, in this process, let's go through it.
[01:14:30.293 --> 01:14:31.714]  You see what happens in 2000.
[01:14:32.054 --> 01:14:32.974]  What gets you thinking?
[01:14:33.014 --> 01:14:34.015]  What gets you researching?
[01:14:35.481 --> 01:14:54.153]  Well, I guess, you know, I started checking out, you know, checking into the literature and in fact there have been problems reported, suspicious anomalies going back to the 1960s when mainframe computers were first used to tally votes and through the 1980s as optical scan and punch card equipment began to become widely used.
[01:14:54.954 --> 01:14:59.597]  Then in the late 1990s and 2000s in the aftermath of the Help America Vote Act,
[01:15:00.357 --> 01:15:02.040]  Orwellian law, if ever there was one.
[01:15:04.243 --> 01:15:16.860]  Rather than helping America vote, what happened is we unleashed at federal government expense a wave of brand new electronic voting equipment all around the country
[01:15:18.882 --> 01:15:22.463]  All of which is essentially vulnerable to a wide-open insider manipulation.
[01:15:22.503 --> 01:15:23.044]  Now, wait a minute.
[01:15:23.064 --> 01:15:32.489]  These global corporations that are moving to Dubai and paying off the government to hand over the roads and the infrastructure, they wouldn't position themselves as an electronic voting machine.
[01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.270]  Now, of course, it's totally secret.
[01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:36.031]  We're not allowed to know.
[01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:36.911]  There's all these anomalies.
[01:15:36.931 --> 01:15:38.072]  But let's just trust them.
[01:15:38.112 --> 01:15:39.412]  I mean, they don't want more power.
[01:15:39.753 --> 01:15:43.475]  They wouldn't try to circumvent the people in the biggest
[01:15:44.535 --> 01:15:47.636]  A superpower there is to use that as an engine of global domination?
[01:15:48.036 --> 01:15:48.976]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[01:15:48.996 --> 01:15:52.937]  History shows you should trust elites and just let them operate in the dark.
[01:15:53.477 --> 01:16:04.900]  Well, you know, a lot of people in my position and in the election integrity movement that are saying, look, there's something really bad going on here, are accused of being conspiracy theorists and being paranoid.
[01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:11.481]  But in the world I work in, you're not paranoid if they are out to get your money.
[01:16:12.279 --> 01:16:35.680]  And, in fact, I'm paid to be a professional paranoid because everybody acknowledges... My God, we have to fight scams every day where there's fake orders and, you know, and in my regular life, you know, I've had some other guy named Alex Jones in Minnesota who had a bookstore and he'd gotten over a year like $8,000 of videotape orders and, you know, and we found out about it.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.242]  I mean, it's just, I mean, in my own life it's constant.
[01:16:38.722 --> 01:16:53.602]  Right, but somehow when it comes to elections, elections determine who gets to spend the world's largest procurement budget, who exercises the world's only superpower military, who gets to put their people on the Supreme Court.
[01:16:54.983 --> 01:17:13.272]  Clearly, voting software is the greatest target for insider, the most irresistible target for insider manipulation in the history of... And lo and behold, Chuckie Schumer and George Bush get together with a six plus billion dollar funding package, and have these special machines that they want to give to all the communities, and we should just trust them.
[01:17:13.332 --> 01:17:14.973]  Again, I don't know what your problem is, Bruce.
[01:17:15.593 --> 01:17:16.254]  And you too, Vicki.
[01:17:16.274 --> 01:17:16.734]  How dare you?
[01:17:17.175 --> 01:17:17.475]  I know.
[01:17:17.895 --> 01:17:18.856]  You're un-American.
[01:17:18.876 --> 01:17:19.837]  I bet O'Reilly would say that.
[01:17:19.877 --> 01:17:21.359]  You're un-American for asking questions.
[01:17:21.579 --> 01:17:24.261]  Do you think your government or anybody would cheat you?
[01:17:24.362 --> 01:17:25.463]  I mean, that's crazy.
[01:17:26.363 --> 01:17:32.769]  Again, we're in a position where we actually have to trust the vendors that they're actually tallying the vote correctly.
[01:17:32.789 --> 01:17:37.013]  We have very, very few things that we can do to try and find out what's really happening.
[01:17:37.073 --> 01:17:38.555]  One of them is exit polls, as I mentioned.
[01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:42.232]  Years and years of reliability.
[01:17:42.592 --> 01:17:45.475]  Suddenly in 2000, the key state, the exit poll was wrong.
[01:17:45.515 --> 01:17:49.218]  Well, of course, two years later, there's the midterm elections in 2002.
[01:17:50.459 --> 01:17:51.920]  Exit polls are done in midterm elections.
[01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:54.002]  The same company says, oh, we screwed up in Florida.
[01:17:54.022 --> 01:17:56.064]  We are going to get it right in 2002.
[01:17:56.524 --> 01:17:57.925]  We're going to revamp our procedures.
[01:17:57.945 --> 01:17:59.286]  We're going to revamp our people.
[01:17:59.366 --> 01:18:00.267]  Don't you worry.
[01:18:00.647 --> 01:18:01.228]  Don't you worry.
[01:18:01.428 --> 01:18:04.831]  And in 2002, there were no exit polls released.
[01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:11.696]  The Voter News Service, the company that sponsored the exit polls since the 1980s, went out of business.
[01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.057]  Very secretive group, yeah.
[01:18:13.097 --> 01:18:14.178]  They went out of business.
[01:18:14.399 --> 01:18:25.609]  They never released their exit polls, and the reason they didn't is because all over the country they were calling races for Democratic candidates in Senate and Governor races where the Republican candidates won.
[01:18:25.769 --> 01:18:26.270]  In Georgia,
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:37.328]  Uh, and in Minnesota, in Alabama, and in other states, and the results were so far different than, the exit poll results were so far different than the official tally.
[01:18:37.348 --> 01:18:38.309]  Well look, it's really simple.
[01:18:38.329 --> 01:18:39.130]  The company imploded.
[01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:51.660]  Exactly, when you've got 75% in the average poll out there against the Republican policies, and Democrats only have a slight victory, when it should have been the biggest landslide in the last hundred years, you've got elections being stolen, period.
[01:18:54.463 --> 01:18:58.946]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:59.287 --> 01:19:03.389]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:03.690 --> 01:19:04.230]  We listened.
[01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:09.534]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:09.794 --> 01:19:10.274]  We listened.
[01:19:10.675 --> 01:19:13.717]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:14.137 --> 01:19:14.658]  We listened.
[01:19:15.118 --> 01:19:18.000]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:18.520]  We're good to go.
[01:19:35.553 --> 01:19:38.194]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:38.374 --> 01:19:38.574]  Only $279.
[01:19:38.614 --> 01:19:39.174]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:39.514]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:40.875]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:19:40.895 --> 01:19:41.415]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:41.435 --> 01:19:43.195]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:19:58.613 --> 01:20:03.436]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:20:03.637 --> 01:20:06.379]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:20:06.419 --> 01:20:07.519]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.483]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:20:14.404 --> 01:20:21.669]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:25.712]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:20:27.862 --> 01:20:31.326]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[01:20:32.307 --> 01:20:33.588]  Call for your copy today.
[01:20:33.828 --> 01:20:36.030]  It's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:37.092 --> 01:20:42.958]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[01:20:43.418 --> 01:20:43.618]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:43.638 --> 01:20:44.019]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:51.576 --> 01:20:56.158]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:20:56.558 --> 01:20:59.500]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:02.381]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:21:02.741 --> 01:21:07.563]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:21:07.943 --> 01:21:13.306]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:21:13.606 --> 01:21:16.567]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:21:16.767 --> 01:21:17.328]  We're good to go.
[01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:40.610]  We're good to go.
[01:21:51.613 --> 01:21:52.213]  It's a fact.
[01:21:52.393 --> 01:21:56.835]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:21:57.175 --> 01:22:02.377]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[01:22:02.637 --> 01:22:05.858]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[01:22:06.098 --> 01:22:13.241]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[01:22:13.581 --> 01:22:20.744]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[01:22:21.004 --> 01:22:23.105]  This is not a debt consolidation company.
[01:22:23.506 --> 01:22:29.850]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their credit card debt.
[01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:33.873]  Instead of living each day in fear, it's time to turn your life around.
[01:22:34.213 --> 01:22:36.775]  Call Day of Jubilee open 9 a.m.
[01:22:36.835 --> 01:22:37.655]  to 5 p.m.
[01:22:37.715 --> 01:22:39.216]  Central Standard Time at 920-293-8024.
[01:22:39.256 --> 01:22:40.697]  That's 920-293-8024 and ask for Robert.
[01:22:40.757 --> 01:22:43.719]  Don't wait any longer to get your life back in order.
[01:22:53.087 --> 01:22:58.231]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:58.911 --> 01:23:01.293]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:03.034 --> 01:23:06.657]  Well, you've heard it said on talk radio that the real discussions go on during the breaks, but the good...
[01:23:07.316 --> 01:23:12.678]  Part is we got the videotape rolling here, so we're going to be putting this on the web at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:23:13.999 --> 01:23:16.900]  Vicki Karp, there's some news stories you want to get into.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:19.801]  ElectionX officials get 18-month sentences.
[01:23:20.461 --> 01:23:28.144]  This is out of the mainstream news, but again, it's back of the newspaper, plain dealer, should be a national story, instead it's Anna Nicole Smith's
[01:23:28.684 --> 01:23:32.589]  And her baby, and who's going to get the baby still, you know, two months into this.
[01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:36.314]  Bruce O'Dell, finish up the point you were making during the break.
[01:23:37.455 --> 01:23:41.981]  You talked about how they're also fixing the exit poles now to match with what they're doing.
[01:23:42.021 --> 01:23:45.825]  This shows a clear architecture designed for fraud.
[01:23:45.865 --> 01:23:47.127]  I mean, you can really see what's happening.
[01:23:47.694 --> 01:23:50.016]  Oh yeah, remember, exit polls are great up to 2000.
[01:23:50.196 --> 01:23:51.197]  They blew up in Florida.
[01:23:51.277 --> 01:23:52.418]  The company said, we'll do better.
[01:23:53.039 --> 01:23:58.644]  In 2002, not only did they not do better, they did so badly they went out of business and never released the exit polls for the first time.
[01:23:59.104 --> 01:24:03.148]  In 2004, a new company picked up and they said, no, no, we're going to do it right this time.
[01:24:03.568 --> 01:24:09.573]  And they had the greatest exit poll discrepancy of all time, which seemed to indicate that John Kerry won the election 51-48 instead of the reverse, losing the election 51-48.
[01:24:14.765 --> 01:24:17.087]  And so that was the final straw.
[01:24:17.107 --> 01:24:24.412]  The exit poll companies now calibrate their exit poll results to the official tallies as the official tallies come in.
[01:24:25.312 --> 01:24:26.573]  And we saw in election night 2006,
[01:24:28.506 --> 01:24:44.935]  The initial cut of the exit polls were released as polls were closing on the East Coast and they seem to show the exit polls taken during the day matched some public opinion polls and showed the Democrat generic House vote was about eleven points, eleven and a half points ahead of the Republicans.
[01:24:46.056 --> 01:24:56.862]  Over the course of the evening as the vote rolled in we've documented, Jonathan Simon and I at the Election Defense Alliance have documented as the evening progressed how the numbers were
[01:24:57.802 --> 01:25:26.673]  statistically weighted to match the official results so by doing that they diluted the democratic participation uh... in the overall sample in a way that left a fingerprint and that's only one layer of it that you're looking at and you're looking at the voting machines themselves then you've got knocking uh... the black voters and others off the rolls i mean there's a whole bunch of other strategies you know that overlay uh... into this uh... but
[01:25:27.533 --> 01:25:31.235]  Specifically, I'd like to talk about your websites.
[01:25:31.295 --> 01:25:41.999]  What websites, what organizations, where should people go to see the cold, hard data that I've got here in front of me that you and your colleagues have put together in a scholarly, technical way?
[01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:48.242]  Well, the main site for you to check is ElectionDefenseAlliance.org.
[01:25:48.342 --> 01:25:50.083]  ElectionDefenseAlliance.org.
[01:25:50.143 --> 01:25:52.764]  We've got links to that up on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:25:53.812 --> 01:25:58.016]  And I always recommend Bed Harris' website, blackboxvoting.org.
[01:25:58.096 --> 01:25:58.957]  It's incredible.
[01:25:59.097 --> 01:26:00.899]  As well as votersunite.org.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:02.401]  Now here's the good news.
[01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:08.687]  I want to put some good news out in the scary forecast and looking back as well.
[01:26:09.428 --> 01:26:14.453]  But I do want to look forward to what's coming up in the next election from the research you guys have done.
[01:26:15.316 --> 01:26:19.639]  I was talking about this again twelve years ago, and people were calling and going, there's not fraud, nothing's going on.
[01:26:19.659 --> 01:26:24.163]  Then five years ago, people started listening, six years ago, seven years ago, but it's accelerated.
[01:26:24.243 --> 01:26:28.827]  Now it is a major issue, but the media spends it like, oh, it's just a problem.
[01:26:28.867 --> 01:26:34.011]  So, the good news is the people are awake, but the bad news is the mainstream media keeps saying, okay, it's a problem.
[01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:37.551]  It's not a problem for a bank robber.
[01:26:37.591 --> 01:26:39.172]  It's not like somebody slipped on the ice.
[01:26:39.512 --> 01:26:42.715]  If a bank robber goes in and robs a bank, there is a crime being committed.
[01:26:42.995 --> 01:26:44.196]  There is something orchestrated.
[01:26:44.396 --> 01:26:45.897]  This is being done by design.
[01:26:45.957 --> 01:26:48.159]  It's not a problem.
[01:26:48.199 --> 01:26:53.683]  And I see this political, you know, not just what they're doing, stealing the elections, but also the political answer.
[01:26:54.004 --> 01:26:58.847]  First, they made it a left-right issue of, well, you know, the Republicans were saying, oh, that's just those dumb liberals.
[01:26:59.147 --> 01:26:59.968]  Mad they're losing.
[01:26:59.988 --> 01:27:00.989]  They're just throwing fits.
[01:27:01.329 --> 01:27:14.498]  And then when the Democrats had, I'd say, a small victory compared to what the polls were all showing and what common sense showed, they then spin it like, well, now the Democratic leadership can say, no, no, see, there's real integrity because we did win.
[01:27:14.758 --> 01:27:21.883]  But it was establishment Democrats almost across the board, and it wasn't the huge landslide of true anti-war candidates.
[01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:24.725]  It was very close margins, especially in the Senate.
[01:27:25.006 --> 01:27:27.888]  And so you put all that together, it doesn't fit with the data.
[01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:29.909]  In fact, it doesn't, not just, you know,
[01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:31.880]  Not that a little bit.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.466]  It's way off in scales that just, you know... And again, I'm not a Democrat, folks.
[01:27:36.686 --> 01:27:38.048]  I cut my teeth being a Republican.
[01:27:38.268 --> 01:27:39.730]  I mean, this is the facts here.
[01:27:40.371 --> 01:27:46.078]  And there's nothing more scary than people thinking they're free and having our process being hijacked.
[01:27:46.658 --> 01:27:51.061]  Well, and the risk here is extremely scary to me.
[01:27:51.721 --> 01:28:03.429]  The true risk is, because everything gets calibrated to the official election results, now exit polls, the selection criteria for even appearing in a public opinion poll is called a likely voter cutoff model.
[01:28:04.069 --> 01:28:19.423]  All of these things are calibrated to the official vote, so by gradually tweaking the dials in one direction, you can create the illusion of a manufactured majority, and everything that you can see politically reinforces that illusion.
[01:28:19.603 --> 01:28:27.630]  And that's the proof that the frauds, there's not just the machines and the engineers going public and people going to jail, and all of your analysis and many other heroes,
[01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:29.951]  The proof is there that they are tweaking.
[01:28:29.991 --> 01:28:31.792]  The proof is that they are calibrating.
[01:28:32.032 --> 01:28:33.012]  Long segment coming up.
[01:28:33.052 --> 01:28:36.154]  Plenty of time to get into all this in great detail and to talk about it.
[01:28:36.174 --> 01:28:37.935]  You're going to be testifying before the legislature.
[01:28:38.215 --> 01:28:41.916]  We really appreciate both of you, and I appreciate you coming down to Texas to do this.
[01:28:42.957 --> 01:28:43.897]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.357 --> 01:28:45.958]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.879 --> 01:28:49.560]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.713 --> 01:28:58.835]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:28:59.055 --> 01:29:00.816]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:29:01.076 --> 01:29:07.378]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:29:07.659 --> 01:29:13.781]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.041 --> 01:29:15.862]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:16.503]  I think so.
[01:29:39.823 --> 01:29:43.145]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[01:29:53.035 --> 01:29:55.636]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[01:29:56.016 --> 01:29:58.997]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[01:29:59.297 --> 01:30:01.358]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[01:30:01.678 --> 01:30:05.999]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:12.162]  SFR Green's Protecta reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.

[01:30:26.355 --> 01:30:28.256]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:30:28.996 --> 01:30:32.158]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:30:32.798 --> 01:30:39.281]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.

[01:32:21.796 --> 01:32:26.437]  Bruce O'Dell is joining us in the studio, as well as Vicki Carb.
[01:32:26.937 --> 01:32:33.878]  I do want to take some time out right now to encourage all the listeners to visit the Secure Online video and bookstore.
[01:32:34.258 --> 01:32:36.779]  They're on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:36.799 --> 01:32:38.759]  We have a Yahoo shopping cart.
[01:32:39.279 --> 01:32:39.720]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:32:51.622 --> 01:32:57.747]  Let's get into the actual technical aspects, and that's where you're the real expert on this, the technical aspects.
[01:32:57.767 --> 01:32:58.888]  And then I want to get into fraud.
[01:32:59.249 --> 01:33:04.873]  Election officials get 18 months in Ohio and get Vicki Karp's take on that.
[01:33:05.073 --> 01:33:07.595]  And Vicki, you chime in any time here as well.
[01:33:08.236 --> 01:33:18.805]  Looking just at fraud itself, how the machines are designed, what we know about some of the companies, and there's thousands of examples of things that have happened that let us know that there's fraud going on.
[01:33:20.655 --> 01:33:31.381]  Well, you know, especially if you're using a push-button, direct recording, electronic machine, touchscreen voting, without a paper trail, even without a paper trail, although a paper trail is no solution.
[01:33:32.242 --> 01:33:37.245]  Basically, it's like you're handing your ballot to a guy behind a curtain and trusting him to record it accurately.
[01:33:38.045 --> 01:33:42.850]  And, you know, in the world I work in, there's absolutely no reason to trust somebody with something that important.
[01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:54.962]  And it's pretty easy to design it where it is verifiable, so why are they pushing, saying, no, no, no, no record, no paper ballots, no... I mean, I do want to talk about solutions as well, but that's the key point here.
[01:33:55.262 --> 01:34:00.227]  They're telling us, just trust us, and then doing everything they can to block us from finding out even how it works.
[01:34:00.547 --> 01:34:04.409]  Well, they say that's security by obscurity, which is nonsense.
[01:34:05.009 --> 01:34:15.294]  Because, again, in the financial services world, we exchange open information about all of our transactions with everybody that's involved, and we have strong proof of identity.
[01:34:15.754 --> 01:34:21.557]  In the voting world, it's illegal to keep track of who voted which way and share that information with anyone else.
[01:34:22.077 --> 01:34:27.479]  So you can't possibly audit an electronic voting system to the same standard that you do in a bank.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:30.941]  It's not even apples and oranges, because those are both fruits.
[01:34:31.301 --> 01:34:32.341]  It's fish and bicycles.
[01:34:32.401 --> 01:34:33.642]  They're two completely different things.
[01:34:36.323 --> 01:34:38.004]  And so we're sold a technical bill of goods.
[01:34:38.264 --> 01:34:41.245]  You push a button on the screen, it lights up with the name of your favorite candidate.
[01:34:43.944 --> 01:34:50.067]  Well, here's the other thing.
[01:34:50.147 --> 01:34:59.311]  Polls have always, especially the scientific and respected ones, have been pretty darn accurate between three to five percent up or down, but generally they were accurate.
[01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:06.396]  Now we see people winning, like Senator Hagel, who's behind in polls, but wins by a landslide.
[01:35:07.236 --> 01:35:12.179]  We see people like Michael McCaul, right here in Texas, behind in polls, but wins by a landslide.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:14.981]  And then now we're seeing national trends.
[01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:21.165]  I mean, in the past, if 70 plus percent of people were against a war, they'd quit it real fast, or people would get thrown out of office.
[01:35:21.566 --> 01:35:26.749]  Now it's just, we don't care, and this is the way it is, and I mean, it's really scary.
[01:35:28.007 --> 01:35:30.749]  Well yeah, I mean voting is the right that secures all of our other rights.
[01:35:30.849 --> 01:35:36.994]  So if we can't vote people out of office that have corrupted an election system or are abusing their powers, we're stuck.
[01:35:37.194 --> 01:35:39.015]  We're serfs in an empire.
[01:35:39.055 --> 01:35:42.017]  We're no longer citizens of a republic until we get back the right to vote.
[01:35:42.658 --> 01:35:49.623]  Now here's a report, and again there's hundreds of these, but election officials get 18 month sentences convicted of rigging a 2004 county recount
[01:35:52.049 --> 01:35:56.611]  And it says, 18 months in prison for rigging a recount of the 2004 presidential election.
[01:35:56.651 --> 01:35:58.151]  Again, this should be national news.
[01:35:58.191 --> 01:35:59.332]  Vicki Karp, it's not.
[01:35:59.372 --> 01:36:00.632]  We see these reports all the time.
[01:36:01.232 --> 01:36:06.174]  It's absolutely unbelievable and it means there's so much about this whole topic that is to me.
[01:36:06.214 --> 01:36:09.335]  I keep thinking that I've seen it all until something like this comes up.
[01:36:09.935 --> 01:36:17.018]  But I've been using that article and one other that I brought with me today to make the argument that, to counter an argument that's made
[01:36:18.198 --> 01:36:26.420]  On behalf of the people who are saying, let's add printers to these fraudulent electronic voting machines and have a paper audit trail so that we can have recounts and we can have audits.
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:29.701]  And so here's an example of why you can't count on a recount.
[01:36:30.081 --> 01:36:32.802]  When the stakes are high, the recount is simply rigged.
[01:36:32.942 --> 01:36:36.662]  And that's what happened in Ohio, in Cuyahoga County, Cleveland in 2004.
[01:36:37.183 --> 01:36:38.023]  Here's the problem.
[01:36:38.303 --> 01:36:43.284]  It is now April 2007 and just two weeks ago these women got their 18-month sentences
[01:36:43.684 --> 01:36:46.325]  And we're being told this did not affect the presidential race.
[01:36:46.425 --> 01:36:47.406]  How do we know that?
[01:36:48.106 --> 01:36:49.807]  So, you can't counter-recamp.
[01:36:50.267 --> 01:37:03.214]  And then the other article that I brought today has to do with auditing, because all the paper trail proponents say, well, if you at least audit a certain percentage of all the paper trails, or the paper receipts, then you'll know if the election was accurate or not, and you can go back and check it.
[01:37:03.614 --> 01:37:06.516]  Well, here's an article that I brought today that says that ES&S
[01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:28.656]  The largest vendor of electronic voting machines in the country actually dictated the terms of an audit to Florida, to the state election official in Florida, for a contested election that ended up in a lawsuit where the Democratic candidate lost by 369 votes, yet 18,000 people showed up and voted and did not vote in that race.
[01:37:28.996 --> 01:37:30.297]  That's referred to as the undervote.
[01:37:30.317 --> 01:37:36.982]  Well, there have been lots of famous cases where a guy's running for mayor in Arkansas and he and his wife and his friends all vote and he doesn't get one vote.
[01:37:38.101 --> 01:37:42.947]  Well, that's just typical of the sort of irregularities, if you will, that come up all the time.
[01:37:42.987 --> 01:37:43.908]  Now, what about flipping?
[01:37:43.948 --> 01:37:49.836]  That's what we saw, because, you know, back in the 80s and 90s, and I remember covering elections in 1998 in Austin, and the city had their cameras
[01:37:55.542 --> 01:38:14.285]  on uh... you know uh... we had a city cable channel that uh... access tv but it's the city access and they had a camera on the computer screen showing it and i'm watching this proposal to steal a bunch of land a big land grab was under environmental guise but it was to give it to some corporations which they later did build five-star golf course on it uh... and
[01:38:15.174 --> 01:38:20.138]  I'm watching this and the prop was losing and suddenly it flips.
[01:38:20.578 --> 01:38:21.839]  And I'm going, excuse me?
[01:38:22.079 --> 01:38:24.381]  And then later I learned that that's the classic tactic.
[01:38:24.701 --> 01:38:27.703]  And then I've talked to my mother, who's pretty smart, but a lot of others here in Austin.
[01:38:28.024 --> 01:38:30.926]  They'll go think that they're voting for somebody and it'll say that name.
[01:38:31.346 --> 01:38:33.848]  And then it'll flip and say they voted, they're going, help me!
[01:38:34.128 --> 01:38:37.150]  And then the technician comes over and says, don't worry about it, it's working fine.
[01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:42.473]  Or the machine's all shut down and then special technicians come in and they ask, who are these people?
[01:38:42.513 --> 01:38:43.193]  We don't know.
[01:38:43.613 --> 01:38:44.854]  I mean, this is getting weird.
[01:38:44.894 --> 01:38:46.795]  I mean, what about flipping?
[01:38:47.536 --> 01:38:53.800]  Well, actually, you know, from a common sense computer security perspective, you'd think that'd be the last thing that somebody would want to do.
[01:38:53.940 --> 01:38:57.002]  If you're going to manipulate the vote, you don't want to leave a trace behind.
[01:38:57.042 --> 01:38:58.062]  You don't want it to be visible.
[01:38:58.102 --> 01:39:00.884]  You want it to recur behind the scenes so you won't be detected.
[01:39:01.930 --> 01:39:04.112]  So actually, I think it's a deliberate tactic.
[01:39:04.852 --> 01:39:07.815]  In computer security, we call it a denial of service attack.
[01:39:08.495 --> 01:39:22.786]  Let's assume that you set up machines in the strongholds of a certain candidate or party, that they're programmed to be hypersensitive, they're programmed to flip votes back and forth randomly, and
[01:39:23.672 --> 01:39:26.254]  You know, what's going to be the result?
[01:39:26.395 --> 01:39:34.402]  Somebody's going to either not see it, in which case you've booked a vote for your candidate, or they're going to see it, and that's probably even better because somebody's going to freak out.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:36.481]  They're going to bring over a poll worker.
[01:39:36.501 --> 01:39:38.301]  They're going to try re-voting again.
[01:39:38.622 --> 01:39:40.322]  So they're going to slow down the voting process.
[01:39:40.342 --> 01:39:41.743]  They're going to bring over a poll worker.
[01:39:42.183 --> 01:39:45.164]  And we've seen that in the last two big elections is that people can't vote.
[01:39:45.184 --> 01:39:46.145]  Like a third of them leave.
[01:39:46.185 --> 01:39:47.465]  It's like midnight and they go, sorry.
[01:39:47.525 --> 01:39:52.527]  Remember those block long lines in Franklin County, Ohio on election night 2004?
[01:39:53.208 --> 01:39:54.808]  Hocking County, Ohio as well.
[01:39:54.969 --> 01:39:55.929]  So it's dirty tricks.
[01:39:57.270 --> 01:40:02.614]  I think that some of it is doubtless just sloppy programming.
[01:40:02.654 --> 01:40:06.777]  There's certainly a lot of evidence of just poor programming practices that never get corrected.
[01:40:16.182 --> 01:40:35.236]  Very, very sophisticated at manipulating and putting in algorithms where it only shaves boats or adds a few here and there to get what you want, but that by flipping it, that that's basically low-level people who are stealing it locally, not really knowing how to manipulate it properly, and just doing something simple.
[01:40:35.476 --> 01:40:45.480]  Okay, well, knowing what I know about how electronic voting is set up in America, if I was an unscrupulous person who wanted to take control, and wanted to take power, I would set up two tiers.
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:55.263]  I would set up the first tier, which is, you could explain as sloppy programming, but are really security vulnerabilities that are, you know, unadvertised features of the system.
[01:40:55.683 --> 01:41:02.826]  You know, wink-wink, nudge-nudge, there's this backdoor administrative access you can use to correct the vote totals if your database gets corrupted.
[01:41:04.392 --> 01:41:17.145]  And that can be used, I think, to implicate people, to get them to buy your machines, to keep using them, to, you know, actually fear having them taken away because they, in some way, are complicit in this kind of petty, low-level fraud.
[01:41:17.185 --> 01:41:23.031]  The kind of thing you saw in Texas in 1948 or in Washington State in 2004.
[01:41:23.091 --> 01:41:25.594]  The magic boxes of votes suddenly appearing here and there.
[01:41:25.794 --> 01:41:35.861]  And so they're even selling them with a wink-wink, that's nod-nod, oh you can play with this if there's a, quote, problem, but really it's got the wireless system built into it or a program.
[01:41:36.181 --> 01:41:38.103]  I mean, how does this broad work?
[01:41:38.143 --> 01:41:47.469]  Well this, and that's actually, I mean, I'm not making this up, this is actually documented in internal de-vote memos on the black box voting website and, you know, King County in Washington, Seattle.
[01:41:47.509 --> 01:41:48.250]  Isn't that the problem?
[01:41:48.310 --> 01:41:49.431]  Is there too much evidence here?
[01:41:49.871 --> 01:41:51.532]  Yeah, well, it's mind-boggling.
[01:41:52.032 --> 01:41:52.653]  Go over it, sorry.
[01:41:52.873 --> 01:42:10.132]  But that's so that's you know whether it's deliberate or accidental or wink wink nudge nudge there's that level and that's the traditional way elections are manipulated locally retail hands-on in America and it you know it's it's friction it one party can do it the other party can do it you know nobody gets a significant advantage in the long term
[01:42:10.672 --> 01:42:14.995]  The scary part is I would put in a vendor-specific tier 2 layer.
[01:42:15.335 --> 01:42:16.576]  It's just vertical integration.
[01:42:16.676 --> 01:42:16.876]  Right.
[01:42:17.016 --> 01:42:23.401]  I would put capabilities, build capabilities into the original version of the software that could be parameterized.
[01:42:23.481 --> 01:42:26.683]  That all I would have to do is send a particular parameter or a number
[01:42:27.563 --> 01:42:39.249]  To a particular location in memory, at a particular time and date, and it would trigger certain behaviors that would be impossible to detect other than monitoring the votes that pass through that machine during an election.
[01:42:39.389 --> 01:42:40.930]  So it triggers a built-in algorithm?
[01:42:41.050 --> 01:42:47.413]  Right, so again, there's absolutely no proof for this, but you know in my profession I'm paid a lot of money to
[01:42:48.013 --> 01:42:58.860]  Reason inductively look at a pattern of facts and that's how you find the fraud you should try and try and figure what what could possibly be explaining this pattern of facts and That's Occam's razor.
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:17.553]  Whatever most simply Describes it in that fraud is the most simple you just don't have computers Magically doing this all across the board and then have cover-ups and saying don't look under the hood well I'm not the only person that this would have occurred to it's it's it would be the it's the way that you would take over the United States without without
[01:43:18.274 --> 01:43:19.335]  Spending a dime?
[01:43:19.375 --> 01:43:20.436]  But nobody wants power.
[01:43:20.496 --> 01:43:21.217]  They wouldn't do that.
[01:43:21.878 --> 01:43:23.941]  And there's no tanks in the streets if you do it that way.
[01:43:23.981 --> 01:43:27.786]  Everybody thinks that the country is just drifting in one direction and that's the way it is.
[01:43:29.384 --> 01:43:46.791]  But long term, how are they going to keep that illusion going as it goes to, again, major polls, 75 plus percent against the war, when it's 90 percent, when it's 95 percent, I mean, at what point, or 90 percent don't want a North American Union, so they just say it doesn't exist while they implement it?
[01:43:46.931 --> 01:43:53.034]  Well, remember, they're calibrating public opinion polls to the official vote tallies, so they'll just stop
[01:43:53.721 --> 01:43:56.585]  Sampling so many people that are opposed to the way things are.
[01:43:56.645 --> 01:43:59.729]  Or they'll have computers and sample key people in certain demographics.
[01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.750]  Yeah, precisely.
[01:44:02.172 --> 01:44:02.672]  Solutions.
[01:44:02.713 --> 01:44:03.534]  How do we stop this?
[01:44:04.975 --> 01:44:09.621]  Well, locally here in Texas, Vote Rescue has spearheaded a
[01:44:10.902 --> 01:44:12.383]  Hand-counted paper ballot bill.
[01:44:12.503 --> 01:44:15.405]  We refer to it as our bill.
[01:44:15.425 --> 01:44:20.168]  We're sort of possessive about it because our founder, Karen Rennick, wrote quite a bit of it.
[01:44:20.208 --> 01:44:26.653]  But it's HB 3894, and it basically would eliminate all electronic voting in the state of Texas.
[01:44:27.594 --> 01:44:46.553]  And that's one of the reasons that we've been working here locally and lobbying with the House Committee on Elections because we've been working to give them more distinctions on their information about electronic voting and why adding printers won't work because there are at least three or four bills at the state level that would add printers to electronic voting.
[01:44:46.753 --> 01:44:47.413]  Let's explain that.
[01:44:47.474 --> 01:44:50.615]  Now, in the past, they would have bubble Scantrons.
[01:44:50.936 --> 01:44:53.897]  Those were still fed into memory banks or into tapes.
[01:44:54.738 --> 01:44:56.159]  Then, we tried to do a recount.
[01:44:56.199 --> 01:45:02.442]  They said, sure, pay $100,000 and we're just going to run the same Scantrons through the same machines.
[01:45:02.602 --> 01:45:07.625]  See, I knew in 1996 there was fraud because I went and volunteered and they actually paid me.
[01:45:07.685 --> 01:45:08.626]  I said, here to volunteer.
[01:45:08.646 --> 01:45:10.127]  They said, no, you get $5 an hour or whatever.
[01:45:10.667 --> 01:45:11.848]  I sat in there stacking them.
[01:45:12.468 --> 01:45:16.552]  And, I mean, half of them were Pat Buchanan or more in the Republican primary.
[01:45:17.072 --> 01:45:19.014]  And then, and I wouldn't cover the debates.
[01:45:19.074 --> 01:45:21.376]  One of my pictures got published in a major magazine, but that's a side issue.
[01:45:21.396 --> 01:45:23.818]  The point is, I was really trying to learn about politics at that time.
[01:45:23.838 --> 01:45:24.718]  I'd just gotten on air.
[01:45:25.379 --> 01:45:31.524]  And I was down there watching that, Vicki, and I was asking other people, I was saying, well, you're from other precincts.
[01:45:31.604 --> 01:45:35.247]  I was in the main counting office, you know, just getting the scantrons stacked, and I was looking.
[01:45:35.267 --> 01:45:37.529]  Pat Buchanan, Pat Buchanan, Pat Buchanan was more than half.
[01:45:37.849 --> 01:45:39.771]  He got like 6% in Travis County.
[01:45:40.411 --> 01:45:50.801]  Well, that's such a good point.
[01:45:50.841 --> 01:45:55.405]  I'm glad you brought it up, Alex, because even across the country, there's all this publicity.
[01:45:55.805 --> 01:46:00.569]  For example, in Florida, the governor is saying, okay, we're not going to have any more DREs, which means touchscreen machines.
[01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:02.011]  We're just going to have paper bouts.
[01:46:02.111 --> 01:46:04.353]  But they're going to count them on these optical scan counters.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:07.743]  And that's something that we really are trying to educate people about.
[01:46:07.783 --> 01:46:14.189]  These optical scan counters have the same basic software, in the case of D-BOLD, the same central tabulator software that can easily be hacked.
[01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:21.817]  And this Hacking Democracy DVD, which just came out, and this is the HBO documentary that tracks Bev Harris and her investigation.
[01:46:21.837 --> 01:46:22.237]  You have those?
[01:46:22.297 --> 01:46:22.998]  I want to carry those.
[01:46:23.038 --> 01:46:23.258]  Sure.
[01:46:24.119 --> 01:46:26.762]  That one is for you, and you can just get on the website and order more.
[01:46:27.342 --> 01:46:32.464]  And I thought that would be something you might want to hear on our website, HackingDemocracy.com.
[01:46:32.964 --> 01:46:44.067]  And we're going to be showing parts of that film at a luncheon tomorrow for legislators, but the public is invited, if I can throw this in right now, Thursday evening at the First Unitarian Church at 4700 Grover.
[01:46:45.988 --> 01:46:52.812]  At 7 o'clock, we're going to show Hacking Democracy, which culminates in the hacking of a real Diebold op scan in Florida.
[01:46:52.892 --> 01:46:56.874]  I've seen it on HBO, and I thought, man, I'm going to carry that when it comes out.
[01:46:57.054 --> 01:46:58.254]  It just came out this week.
[01:46:59.235 --> 01:47:00.876]  That's yours.
[01:47:01.056 --> 01:47:01.516]  Thank you.
[01:47:03.157 --> 01:47:06.158]  Now, you're going to be testifying, aren't you?
[01:47:06.378 --> 01:47:06.598]  Yes.
[01:47:06.738 --> 01:47:07.659]  Tell folks about that, Bruce.
[01:47:08.379 --> 01:47:12.381]  Yeah, this afternoon I'll be testifying before the Committee on Elections in the State House.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.683]  I think it's open to the public.
[01:47:17.744 --> 01:47:19.666]  It's in the State Capitol room E-2028.
[01:47:23.099 --> 01:47:25.081]  And that's today at 2 p.m.
[01:47:25.661 --> 01:47:27.522]  Wow, so you've got to run, right?
[01:47:27.642 --> 01:47:28.503]  When we leave here.
[01:47:28.763 --> 01:47:30.564]  Here in about 15 minutes, yeah.
[01:47:31.985 --> 01:47:35.168]  Well, basically, I want to echo what Vicki said.
[01:47:35.208 --> 01:47:46.936]  I'll be commenting specifically on some bills that are very well-intentioned in some ways to the technically naive in that it calls for more testing of touchscreen voting equipment, it calls for being careful about
[01:47:47.376 --> 01:47:51.638]  Who has access to the physical storage media and so on.
[01:47:51.698 --> 01:47:52.559]  It sounds good.
[01:47:52.619 --> 01:47:53.559]  It's well-intentioned.
[01:47:53.719 --> 01:47:55.440]  What we need is real diagnostics.
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:05.685]  But basically all it's doing is it's optimizing, you know, potentially just optimizing how we move malicious code from machine to machine.
[01:48:06.045 --> 01:48:08.326]  It doesn't deal with the fundamental issues and in fact
[01:48:08.926 --> 01:48:12.249]  No, I don't think so.
[01:48:24.787 --> 01:48:27.068]  And that's certainly the case with electronic voting.
[01:48:27.108 --> 01:48:32.871]  Well, it's like RFID, and then every security expert goes, this is going to make us even more open to fraud.
[01:48:32.911 --> 01:48:34.671]  And they're going, no, it's the new solution.
[01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:42.395]  It's the latest and greatest, and people have been sold a bill of goods by a lot of my colleagues, and I feel like I should apologize for...
[01:48:43.115 --> 01:48:44.356]  So, what is the solution?
[01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:04.514]  There's no need to have machines count our ballots in secret.
[01:49:05.515 --> 01:49:07.877]  Voting is not a computer transaction, because we can't secure it.
[01:49:07.937 --> 01:49:08.938]  It's a civic transaction.
[01:49:08.958 --> 01:49:11.661]  If the system's in place, how do you remove that?
[01:49:12.381 --> 01:49:24.152]  My idea is to have a national petition, county by county, city by city, to recall the machines, and then force the re-adoption, because it's the only way to do it, because they've got the machines in place.
[01:49:24.272 --> 01:49:25.733]  That's what we're working on here locally.
[01:49:25.753 --> 01:49:27.294]  That's what our bill is really all about.
[01:49:27.334 --> 01:49:34.517]  It's saying we're outlawing, we would like to outlaw the use of electronic voting for the state of Texas and we'd love to see it happen at the national level.
[01:49:34.758 --> 01:49:43.602]  Sure, I mean, you know, we've spent a lot of money based on some very bad advice and maybe some calculated self-interest on basically what amounts to a lot of technical boat anchors.
[01:49:44.163 --> 01:49:50.426]  And by continuing to buy new computer voting... We've got a final segment with our guest.
[01:49:55.738 --> 01:50:01.164]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.564 --> 01:50:09.172]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.887 --> 01:50:16.951]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.332 --> 01:50:28.759]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.079 --> 01:50:32.541]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.041 --> 01:50:34.962]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.302 --> 01:50:39.165]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.239 --> 01:50:57.320]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:57.400 --> 01:51:04.703]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:04.843 --> 01:51:15.486]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:15.686 --> 01:51:20.227]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:20.507 --> 01:51:25.512]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:51:25.713 --> 01:51:28.656]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:28.876 --> 01:51:38.746]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:51:38.766 --> 01:51:39.707]  Get a two-pack for only $9.
[01:51:39.787 --> 01:51:40.007]  We're good.
[01:51:52.048 --> 01:51:56.110]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[01:51:56.310 --> 01:51:59.712]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[01:51:59.892 --> 01:52:03.394]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[01:52:03.634 --> 01:52:06.835]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[01:52:06.855 --> 01:52:12.378]  This basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[01:52:12.398 --> 01:52:17.621]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[01:52:17.961 --> 01:52:18.642]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:52:35.501 --> 01:52:45.484]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822, or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[01:52:45.864 --> 01:52:47.064]  That toll-free number again?
[01:52:47.084 --> 01:52:47.584]  1-877-928-8822.
[01:52:48.224 --> 01:53:01.188]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:01.588 --> 01:53:04.729]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.888 --> 01:53:09.574]  In one hour and five minutes, Bruce O'Dell and Vicki Karp are going to be down there.
[01:53:09.594 --> 01:53:12.378]  Are both of you going to be testifying today before the committee?
[01:53:12.659 --> 01:53:13.861]  Bruce is our star today.
[01:53:14.841 --> 01:53:17.804]  Well, again, give folks that committee room in one hour.
[01:53:18.084 --> 01:53:19.105]  People need to get down there.
[01:53:19.165 --> 01:53:21.727]  Take an extended lunch or you're not working today.
[01:53:21.747 --> 01:53:22.788]  This is important.
[01:53:22.828 --> 01:53:23.268]  Get down there.
[01:53:23.688 --> 01:53:28.192]  It's going to be at 2 o'clock at the Capitol, room E2.028.
[01:53:28.732 --> 01:53:34.457]  And Bruce will have pretty much the first, they may have a few minutes intro and then he'll have the first 20 minutes of that hearing.
[01:53:34.997 --> 01:53:37.920]  And then tomorrow, I'd just like to briefly mention our events tomorrow.
[01:53:37.960 --> 01:53:40.322]  We have a press conference going on also at the Capitol, 1115.
[01:53:42.003 --> 01:53:51.274]  And we'll have several speakers there including Bruce and some others very interesting and that's going to be 1115 at the Capitol, room E2.002.
[01:53:51.734 --> 01:53:58.141]  And then the last event I want to mention is again the Unitarian Church event at 4700 Grover on Thursday, tomorrow evening.
[01:53:58.181 --> 01:54:03.247]  We're going to be showing Hacking Democracy and Bruce will be doing his presentation for the public.
[01:54:04.033 --> 01:54:10.318]  And then I just want to mention that we hope that anyone that's in support of hand-counted paper ballots, they can get on Vote Rescue.
[01:54:10.338 --> 01:54:12.981]  I think we have a link to how to find out who your representative is.
[01:54:13.021 --> 01:54:14.582]  We need sponsors for that bill.
[01:54:14.682 --> 01:54:17.665]  Well, I would just add there's nothing more important than defending
[01:54:19.546 --> 01:54:21.888]  The integrity of the election system.
[01:54:21.908 --> 01:54:24.249]  I mean, that sounds like a no-brainer, but it's simple.
[01:54:24.990 --> 01:54:29.833]  But it's so integral and it's at the very base and foundation of our society.
[01:54:30.214 --> 01:54:32.895]  And they told us to shut up ten years ago, five years ago.
[01:54:33.216 --> 01:54:34.136]  They said we were kooks.
[01:54:34.216 --> 01:54:35.537]  Now it's a mainstream issue.
[01:54:35.798 --> 01:54:36.678]  We're not going away.
[01:54:36.698 --> 01:54:39.940]  And it's beautiful what Bruce and you, Vicky, are doing.
[01:54:40.161 --> 01:54:41.622]  Bruce, you've got about two or three minutes.
[01:54:42.062 --> 01:54:43.663]  Closing comments for folks out there.
[01:54:44.043 --> 01:54:47.906]  Key points, solutions, ideas to get the original paper ballots back.
[01:54:48.815 --> 01:54:59.629]  Yeah, well, first of all, I'd advise anybody that's not particularly technical, if you're trying to sort out what people, you know, so-called experts are talking about in regard to voting issues and electronic voting security issues,
[01:55:00.376 --> 01:55:02.498]  Ask them where they get their money from.
[01:55:02.518 --> 01:55:19.375]  I think you'll find that a lot of my colleagues that make a very good living indeed consulting for voting companies, certifying software, developing software, trying to build a better mousetrap, those folks are going to have a different perspective than I do.
[01:55:19.615 --> 01:55:21.617]  The perspective I have is, first of all,
[01:55:23.579 --> 01:55:28.323]  I still don't know what the problem is that we're trying to solve with electronic voting.
[01:55:28.984 --> 01:55:31.526]  I mean, let's say voting is a civic transaction.
[01:55:31.586 --> 01:55:33.007]  It's not a computer transaction.
[01:55:33.508 --> 01:55:51.523]  By which I mean, you know, citizens all over the country, and, you know, in countries like Canada, and in Italy, and in Ireland, and in Australia, you know, all over the world, even in war zones, in Iraq, in Palestine, under very trying circumstances, people gather together and they vote
[01:55:52.270 --> 01:55:58.392]  In public, they store the votes in the precinct, and at the end of the day, everyone gathers around.
[01:55:58.532 --> 01:56:00.732]  And that's publicly announced, and then they tally them!
[01:56:00.892 --> 01:56:02.333]  And they tally them in public.
[01:56:02.353 --> 01:56:02.953]  And it was fun!
[01:56:02.993 --> 01:56:04.813]  You'd go down and hang out and have a barbecue going.
[01:56:04.853 --> 01:56:05.834]  It was in front of everybody.
[01:56:06.034 --> 01:56:07.354]  Right, exactly.
[01:56:07.514 --> 01:56:10.615]  And that's the checks and balances that this country was founded on.
[01:56:10.635 --> 01:56:13.056]  The founding fathers knew about human nature.
[01:56:13.116 --> 01:56:16.837]  They knew that if something that would give you access to power
[01:56:17.917 --> 01:56:23.160]  Could be corrupted, it would be corrupted, and the only way to prevent that from happening is checks and balances.
[01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:30.445]  And in this case, voting is the most important transaction we do, and there's no reason why the people themselves shouldn't do it.
[01:56:30.565 --> 01:56:33.847]  I mean, the average precinct in the U.S.
[01:56:34.027 --> 01:56:34.767]  is 500 voters.
[01:56:34.847 --> 01:56:41.211]  Do you mean to say, do my colleagues mean to say that we can't trust our fellow citizens to count up to 250 in public?
[01:56:43.312 --> 01:56:44.394]  Once every two years.
[01:56:44.635 --> 01:56:46.037]  It's not rocket science.
[01:56:46.057 --> 01:56:47.178]  It's not rocket science.
[01:56:47.679 --> 01:56:48.220]  Exactly.
[01:56:48.480 --> 01:56:51.165]  And it also decentralizes it, just going back to what you said about...
[01:56:51.784 --> 01:56:53.445]  There'll be friction, there'll be problems.
[01:56:53.825 --> 01:56:59.830]  There's going to be fraud here or there, but it's not that unified fraud, the man on the white horse, that the founding fathers were so worried about.
[01:56:59.850 --> 01:57:00.530]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:02.191]  The remote control fraud doesn't happen.
[01:57:02.391 --> 01:57:12.959]  And, you know, the most important thing is people need to have a sense that they own the process, that they trust the outcome, even if
[01:57:13.579 --> 01:57:14.880]  Your candidate doesn't win.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:19.143]  If you know there was an honest tally of your neighbors, you can live with the end result.
[01:57:19.223 --> 01:57:24.046]  And no doubt, as a fraud expert, you look at this architecture, it appears to be designed for fraud.
[01:57:25.127 --> 01:57:29.610]  There's so many known vulnerabilities, and God only knows how many unknown.
[01:57:29.670 --> 01:57:31.070]  It must be designed that way.
[01:57:32.311 --> 01:57:36.894]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:48.684 --> 01:57:49.324]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.005 --> 01:57:51.066]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.766 --> 01:57:53.508]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.528 --> 01:57:54.349]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.109 --> 01:57:55.990]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.010 --> 01:58:00.594]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.855 --> 01:58:04.959]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.459 --> 01:58:09.282]  We're doing five more minutes with Bruce Hodel and Vicki Karp.
[01:58:09.763 --> 01:58:11.665]  She's the local election
[01:58:12.472 --> 01:58:13.613]  We're good to go.
[01:58:35.266 --> 01:58:35.766]  We're good to go.
[01:59:04.523 --> 01:59:05.724]  You know, control fraud.
[01:59:05.744 --> 01:59:12.466]  It's not going to be perfect, it'll never be perfect, but this top-down, you know, this integration is designed for it.
[01:59:12.506 --> 01:59:14.207]  And then, any other points you want to make?
[01:59:15.307 --> 01:59:22.750]  Oh yeah, I mean, well, you know, the only problem with hand-counted paper ballots is that it's cheaper, more accurate, and more secure than all the other alternatives.
[01:59:23.110 --> 01:59:28.092]  But unfortunately, it doesn't have a price tag on it, it doesn't have a multi-billion dollar industry associated with it.
[01:59:28.232 --> 01:59:32.574]  That's right, they get to make billions, but then at the same time, they also get to destroy our republic.
[01:59:33.382 --> 01:59:34.983]  Well, it sounds like a reasonable exchange.
[01:59:35.203 --> 01:59:35.604]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:36.204 --> 01:59:38.646]  Well, a total power and control, and billions to do it.
[01:59:38.926 --> 01:59:46.611]  I saw somebody on a list, Sir Rahman, said, we're living in a world where we pretend to vote and they pretend to get elected, and that's pretty much where we are right now.
[01:59:47.011 --> 01:59:51.114]  Well, you know, what is it, Joseph Stalin had the famous quote, it doesn't matter who
[01:59:53.044 --> 01:59:54.025]  Who counts the votes?
[01:59:54.065 --> 01:59:56.406]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.
[01:59:56.426 --> 02:00:01.088]  There's just simply no justification at all other than some misguided desire for the latest and greatest thing that we seem to have in America.
[02:00:17.627 --> 02:00:28.454]  That there's simply no reason to automate something that can be done so much better, more inexpensively, and I think, you know, more securely by the citizens themselves.
[02:00:28.715 --> 02:00:40.303]  Well, for anybody who's doubting what's happened, we've had all these engineers and whistleblowers and people go public and people going to jail for engaging in election fraud, and the mainstream media is trying to keep it from becoming a real national issue.
[02:00:40.823 --> 02:00:43.145]  But if you combine it in with the torture
[02:00:43.985 --> 02:00:46.407]  And you combine it in with the FEMA camps.
[02:00:46.447 --> 02:00:48.568]  You combine it in with the WMD lies.
[02:00:48.608 --> 02:00:52.090]  And you combine it in with the cameras and the police in black uniforms.
[02:00:52.470 --> 02:00:54.071]  I mean, this country's going in the wrong direction.
[02:00:54.112 --> 02:00:54.752]  Who could deny that?
[02:00:56.269 --> 02:01:00.570]  Well, and I really think the people are not the ones driving that.
[02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:05.411]  And because of election fraud, the people in power, the arrogance is unbelievable.
[02:01:05.471 --> 02:01:08.152]  As you've mentioned many times, Alex, they know we can't vote them out.
[02:01:08.552 --> 02:01:12.233]  So that's what it's all about, is just people taking back their elections.
[02:01:12.373 --> 02:01:18.474]  And locally here, we'd like to invite people to look at our website, VoteRescue.org, and to get involved with us here.
[02:01:18.774 --> 02:01:23.756]  And in other areas, we'd like to encourage people to look at our website to figure out how they can start groups in their own area.
[02:01:23.896 --> 02:01:24.036]  Good.
[02:01:24.076 --> 02:01:24.976]  Have you given that website out?
[02:01:25.636 --> 02:01:27.658]  That's a great name.
[02:01:28.159 --> 02:01:30.661]  Bruce, in closing, do you have hope?
[02:01:30.761 --> 02:01:33.143]  I mean, you've been in this fight a while now.
[02:01:33.804 --> 02:01:34.965]  What's your prognosis?
[02:01:36.112 --> 02:01:41.253]  Well, you know, actually you've got to be hopeful because the alternative is utter despair.
[02:01:41.533 --> 02:01:45.995]  And, you know, we still have the power to change things in America.
[02:01:46.095 --> 02:01:52.256]  And particularly, you know, once the issues are properly explained, ordinary people get it.
[02:01:52.436 --> 02:01:58.258]  And this is, you know, a Zogby poll says that 92% of the American public want their votes to be counted.
[02:01:58.878 --> 02:02:01.321]  In a transparent, open, and public process.
[02:02:01.601 --> 02:02:08.409]  And when you get 92% support for any issue in America, it's hard to think you're going to be able to keep the lid on it forever.
[02:02:08.429 --> 02:02:10.672]  And that was not a government-sponsored Zogby poll.
[02:02:10.712 --> 02:02:13.315]  That was sponsored by an attorney, an election attorney, Paul Leto.
[02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:15.374]  Absolutely.
[02:02:15.414 --> 02:02:16.635]  Well, we know it's accurate.
[02:02:17.635 --> 02:02:19.376]  Godspeed in your testimony.
[02:02:19.816 --> 02:02:21.297]  And Bruce, pleasure meeting you.
[02:02:21.517 --> 02:02:22.097]  Pleasure meeting you.
[02:02:22.157 --> 02:02:23.457]  Vicki, always great to see you.
[02:02:23.477 --> 02:02:24.198]  Thank you so much.
[02:02:24.218 --> 02:02:24.858]  Thanks for coming in.
[02:02:24.878 --> 02:02:28.359]  This will be on the local TV show in the next few weeks and at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:28.579 --> 02:02:30.960]  Again, good luck down there and take care.
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:31.920]  Thanks a million, Alex.
[02:02:33.761 --> 02:02:34.401]  All right, folks.
[02:02:34.501 --> 02:02:36.722]  We are, they are in here in the tiny studio.
[02:02:36.742 --> 02:02:38.383]  It's like a submarine in here.
[02:02:38.883 --> 02:02:40.564]  And I really do want to thank them for coming in.
[02:02:40.584 --> 02:02:43.705]  They are literally running on the studio as we speak to go down.
[02:02:47.421 --> 02:02:52.890]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:53.250 --> 02:03:00.862]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.576 --> 02:03:08.620]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:20.466]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.766 --> 02:03:24.208]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:26.650]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.990 --> 02:03:30.852]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.043 --> 02:04:47.624]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[02:04:47.764 --> 02:04:49.945]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[02:04:50.205 --> 02:05:00.308]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[02:05:00.628 --> 02:05:02.949]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[02:05:48.715 --> 02:05:49.375]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.036 --> 02:05:51.076]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:51.797 --> 02:05:52.938]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:53.578 --> 02:05:54.378]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.139 --> 02:05:55.979]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.700 --> 02:06:00.622]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:00.882 --> 02:06:05.004]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:05.185 --> 02:06:06.545]  I remember
[02:06:17.515 --> 02:06:29.463]  Eight, nine years ago, interviewing Black Rider and just great TV host Tony Brown about the Illuminati, about the New World Order.
[02:06:29.483 --> 02:06:30.403]  He'd written a book about it.
[02:06:31.704 --> 02:06:35.987]  And Bill O'Reilly interviewed him and basically kind of agreed with him about the Illuminati and the New World Order.
[02:06:37.168 --> 02:06:40.790]  Bill O'Reilly did all sorts of investigations.
[02:06:41.050 --> 02:06:44.052]  I would say that he was one of the better mainstream reporters.
[02:06:45.293 --> 02:06:49.435]  He reported for some of the networks, and he had shows on Inside Edition, you name it.
[02:06:51.576 --> 02:06:56.899]  And then, I remember six years ago, he was against the open borders, and then he just totally shut up about it.
[02:06:57.979 --> 02:06:59.720]  And he's gotten worse and worse and worse.
[02:07:00.380 --> 02:07:11.626]  Until the last five years, he has been a total New World Order shill, calling for arrest, calling for execution, calling for firing of everybody, calling for no free speech.
[02:07:12.246 --> 02:07:13.807]  I thought we'd go back and see
[02:07:15.089 --> 02:07:16.910]  Alan Greenspan was anti-New World Order.
[02:07:17.771 --> 02:07:22.634]  He wrote a chapter for a book that Ayn Rand published.
[02:07:26.637 --> 02:07:26.957]  What is it?
[02:07:26.997 --> 02:07:27.658]  Capitalism?
[02:07:27.698 --> 02:07:28.698]  The Unknown Ideal?
[02:07:28.718 --> 02:07:30.540]  I actually dug that out.
[02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:31.640]  We actually have a copy of it out there.
[02:07:31.660 --> 02:07:34.362]  I ought to go grab that and read excerpts of Alan Greenspan.
[02:07:34.382 --> 02:07:35.803]  We ought to get a transcript of that.
[02:07:35.823 --> 02:07:38.925]  We ought to have somebody type that into the computer and put it on the web so folks can read it.
[02:07:39.245 --> 02:07:40.246]  I've never seen that online.
[02:07:44.281 --> 02:07:45.362]  I said we dug it out of storage.
[02:07:45.722 --> 02:07:54.929]  Actually, we bought a new one from Amazon, but Greenspan was against the Federal Reserve, the private bankers, the New World Order, and he was very effective against them.
[02:07:54.949 --> 02:07:56.110]  They just went and hired him, folks.
[02:07:56.650 --> 02:08:04.156]  It's the same thing with Bill O'Reilly, because to be an effective brainwasher and demonizer, they try to get people who've been in our camp.
[02:08:04.816 --> 02:08:07.238]  So here's Bill O'Reilly doing a report.
[02:08:08.707 --> 02:08:13.770]  This is O'Reilly when he was on Inside Edition, reports on Oswald's association with the CIA.
[02:08:14.090 --> 02:08:16.772]  Gee, Bill, here you are spouting a conspiracy theory.
[02:08:17.112 --> 02:08:17.933]  That's un-American.
[02:08:18.373 --> 02:08:20.574]  Why do you hate this country, you two-faced hypocrite?
[02:08:21.335 --> 02:08:22.936]  I'm not saying that you should be fired.
[02:08:22.976 --> 02:08:24.677]  I'm saying that Fox News has a big problem.
[02:08:25.057 --> 02:08:28.159]  Just when was it that you turned to the dark side?
[02:08:28.739 --> 02:08:31.081]  And that's the comment made by the YouTuber that posted this.
[02:08:31.621 --> 02:08:33.742]  And yeah, there's lots of reports like this from O'Reilly.
[02:08:33.862 --> 02:08:34.763]  I remember them.
[02:08:35.904 --> 02:08:36.344]  So, uh,
[02:08:37.293 --> 02:08:38.994]  Well, this is like 12 years old.
[02:08:39.194 --> 02:08:39.595]  Here it is.
[02:08:42.236 --> 02:08:45.939]  The Select Committee on Assassinations will at this time come to order.
[02:08:46.139 --> 02:08:58.287]  The most damaging sealed documents of the House Select Committee on Assassinations accuse high-ranking officials of the Central Intelligence Agency of lying to the people of the United States about Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:08:58.587 --> 02:09:04.971]  House investigators believe this man, David Atlee Phillips, met with Oswald two months before the assassination.
[02:09:05.515 --> 02:09:13.459]  Phillips was the CIA's Chief of Western Hemisphere Operations, and was in charge, among other things, of plots against Fidel Castro.
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:27.027]  According to the secret reports, Antonio Viciana, a leader of anti-Castro Cubans directed by the CIA, saw Oswald talking to a senior CIA agent he knew by the cover name Maurice Bishop.
[02:09:27.827 --> 02:09:34.291]  Viciana provided enough information for house investigators to compile this sketch of the agent who met Oswald.
[02:09:34.864 --> 02:09:35.864]  Could it have been Phillips?
[02:09:36.364 --> 02:09:38.165]  Investigators believe it was.
[02:09:38.945 --> 02:09:45.787]  Phillips denied under oath that he knew Oswald, but house investigators did not believe him and wanted him charged with perjury.
[02:09:46.347 --> 02:09:50.008]  The government declined to prosecute, leaving investigators furious.
[02:09:50.808 --> 02:09:54.569]  The director of the CIA in 1963 was John McCone.
[02:09:55.009 --> 02:10:01.151]  He caused a sensation among committee staffers when he admitted there was an agent using the cover name Bishop.
[02:10:01.846 --> 02:10:05.787]  But a secret memo reveals he was allowed to reverse his testimony.
[02:10:06.207 --> 02:10:08.107]  A CIA lawyer wrote the committee.
[02:10:08.808 --> 02:10:11.228]  I should inform you that he had been in error.
[02:10:11.828 --> 02:10:15.869]  In summary, Mr. McCone withdraws his statements on this point.
[02:10:16.529 --> 02:10:23.611]  The man who fingered Maurice Bishop, Antonio Viciana, was shot in the head soon after testifying, but survived.
[02:10:24.271 --> 02:10:26.751]  Frightened, he will no longer talk about the case.
[02:10:27.112 --> 02:10:28.952]  We caught up with him in Florida.
[02:10:29.748 --> 02:10:31.630]  They wounded me in the head.
[02:10:32.991 --> 02:10:33.951]  They tried to kill me.
[02:10:33.971 --> 02:10:35.913]  You know why?
[02:10:35.973 --> 02:10:37.754]  I don't know, but maybe I know.
[02:10:37.814 --> 02:10:38.975]  Maybe I know.
[02:10:39.095 --> 02:10:40.216]  Did they tell you?
[02:10:40.316 --> 02:10:41.056]  No.
[02:10:41.197 --> 02:10:41.557]  Accident.
[02:10:41.697 --> 02:10:43.398]  Accident.
[02:10:48.862 --> 02:10:50.864]  David Adly Phillips died of cancer in 1988.
[02:10:52.165 --> 02:10:57.869]  Investigators believe Phillips was angry at JFK for botching the Cuban Bay of Pigs operation.
[02:10:58.436 --> 02:10:59.877]  Did you kill the President?
[02:11:00.057 --> 02:11:02.179]  The second explosive revelation in the S.H.I.E.L.D.
[02:11:02.199 --> 02:11:06.322]  document also links the CIA directly to Oswald.
[02:11:06.622 --> 02:11:11.465]  While living in Dallas, Oswald was befriended by Russian-born George D'Amore and S.H.I.E.L.D.
[02:11:11.966 --> 02:11:18.631]  Investigators determined he was a contract agent for the CIA in Central America and the Caribbean.
[02:11:18.771 --> 02:11:24.615]  In 1977, moments before he was to be interviewed by House investigators, D'Amore and S.H.I.E.L.D.
[02:11:24.735 --> 02:11:27.377]  blew his brains out with a 20-gauge shotgun.
[02:11:27.944 --> 02:11:33.707]  House investigators believe he was a crucial link between the CIA and Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:11:34.227 --> 02:11:39.649]  There is no question that the sealed JFK files are extremely embarrassing for the CIA.
[02:11:40.029 --> 02:11:52.135]  House investigators have told Inside Edition that the agency did not fully cooperate in their investigation and that the CIA had final say in the report that the House Assassinations Committee made public.
[02:11:52.575 --> 02:11:57.578]  Thus, the public report makes no mention of the CIA's links with Lee Harvey Oswald.
[02:11:57.918 --> 02:12:00.800]  But the secret documents are another story.
[02:12:01.540 --> 02:12:06.903]  One interesting sidelight, the movie JFK was partially based on Jim Garrison's investigation in New Orleans.
[02:12:07.183 --> 02:12:19.490]  Well, house investigators uncovered evidence that the CIA planted nine agents inside the Garrison investigation to feed him false information and to report back to Langley on what Garrison was finding out.
[02:12:22.111 --> 02:12:25.694]  Now, that is an extremely accurate report.
[02:12:26.694 --> 02:12:30.737]  That's Bill O'Reilly, who was the producer on that report, and wrote that.
[02:12:32.038 --> 02:12:36.141]  Bill O'Reilly knows exactly what he's doing, which is what makes him so evil.
[02:12:37.101 --> 02:12:39.283]  By the way, I have the book here in front of me.
[02:12:39.303 --> 02:12:40.824]  We ought to carry this.
[02:12:42.325 --> 02:12:45.107]  Ayn Rand, Capitalism, the Unknown Ideal.
[02:12:45.127 --> 02:12:47.889]  And there's a collection of essays.
[02:12:48.909 --> 02:12:51.211]  And guess who is in here?
[02:12:52.975 --> 02:12:53.936]  I didn't mark this one.
[02:12:53.956 --> 02:12:55.037]  This is a new book I got.
[02:12:55.737 --> 02:12:58.399]  I read this probably 15 years ago before I even got on air.
[02:12:58.459 --> 02:13:03.902]  Let me find Greenspan.
[02:13:03.922 --> 02:13:07.744]  Let me go to G here in the bibliography.
[02:13:08.705 --> 02:13:14.929]  Here in the back, I guess I'm trying to find it.
[02:13:14.969 --> 02:13:20.312]  I'm trying to find the exact page that he's in here.
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:25.803]  Fellow Reserve System Greenspan.
[02:13:25.843 --> 02:13:26.324]  There it is.
[02:13:27.665 --> 02:13:29.846]  Good old Mr. Greenspan.
[02:13:30.347 --> 02:13:32.428]  And then you can flip over.
[02:13:34.150 --> 02:13:39.153]  Alan Greenspan's page 75 to page 85, and then he's in there again.
[02:13:39.173 --> 02:13:45.418]  So let me go to page 75 here in this 300 and something page book.
[02:13:48.429 --> 02:13:51.250]  Oh, that's just one of the footnotes where he's in an article.
[02:13:51.691 --> 02:13:54.312]  But again, he wrote a large section of this book.
[02:13:54.472 --> 02:13:55.333]  Alan Greenspan.
[02:13:57.134 --> 02:14:03.198]  And he goes into how the Federal Reserve is evil and private and how it runs a big scam and how we're controlled by bankers.
[02:14:05.439 --> 02:14:11.303]  And he was a big intellectual, ran an investment house trading in gold in New York City.
[02:14:11.323 --> 02:14:15.546]  And they just got sick of him waking everybody up about the Federal Reserve.
[02:14:16.326 --> 02:14:16.947]  He was one of us.
[02:14:18.633 --> 02:14:22.394]  This book was published in the 60s.
[02:14:22.454 --> 02:14:22.935]  I know that.
[02:14:22.975 --> 02:14:26.736]  Let me get the actual publishing date by Signet Book.
[02:14:28.356 --> 02:14:45.382]  First printing was in November of 1967 and it is in its 40th printing just from the 67 publication.
[02:14:46.083 --> 02:14:47.323]  And then it goes on with all the other
[02:14:48.430 --> 02:14:48.670]  I don't
[02:15:12.136 --> 02:15:15.458]  He wrote that, and he wrote Gold and Economic Freedom.
[02:15:16.058 --> 02:15:16.578]  That's page 101.
[02:15:17.279 --> 02:15:18.920]  He wrote Antitrust 63.
[02:15:20.581 --> 02:15:22.522]  He wrote the Assault on Integrity 126.
[02:15:26.624 --> 02:15:28.205]  And that's it.
[02:15:28.245 --> 02:15:30.726]  Okay, so I've gone from memory reading this 15 years ago.
[02:15:30.746 --> 02:15:31.547]  I said he wrote two.
[02:15:32.587 --> 02:15:34.028]  He wrote three essays in here.
[02:15:34.048 --> 02:15:37.310]  And he's quoted in several others.
[02:15:38.430 --> 02:15:39.131]  And you just heard
[02:15:42.293 --> 02:15:49.858]  Now, Americans today, those who still watch mainstream TV, couldn't even follow an Inside Edition report with names and facts like you heard from O'Reilly.
[02:15:50.058 --> 02:15:55.702]  That's the massive, scientifically crafted, actual dumbing down and brainwashing going on.
[02:15:56.943 --> 02:15:58.604]  You know you can't talk to the general public now.
[02:15:58.624 --> 02:15:59.865]  I mean, we're not even that smart here.
[02:15:59.885 --> 02:16:00.625]  You're not that smart.
[02:16:00.786 --> 02:16:01.586]  We're just average folks.
[02:16:01.626 --> 02:16:04.168]  And you try to talk to your neighbor, they're like, huh, what?
[02:16:05.177 --> 02:16:05.857]  You heard about the game?
[02:16:05.877 --> 02:16:07.999]  You're like, hey, you know, the border's open there.
[02:16:08.359 --> 02:16:09.219]  Getting into the sovereignty.
[02:16:10.380 --> 02:16:10.860]  What's that?
[02:16:11.360 --> 02:16:12.061]  What's sovereignty?
[02:16:12.321 --> 02:16:13.481]  Listen, we're losing freedom.
[02:16:13.881 --> 02:16:15.382]  The dollar's plunging in value.
[02:16:15.702 --> 02:16:16.383]  What's that mean?
[02:16:18.544 --> 02:16:19.244]  I mean, literally!
[02:16:21.365 --> 02:16:22.786]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:16:23.126 --> 02:16:30.690]  This is what I meant to say earlier about something on my MySpace, posting a thing about how Tommy Franks is a real man and those of us that aren't for the war can't get women.
[02:16:30.750 --> 02:16:32.911]  I mean, this is what this Navy guy posted.
[02:16:34.119 --> 02:16:35.060]  Really weird dribble.
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:43.523]  Hey, did you know, Punk, that he's on CIA payroll claiming that he was independently saying he was for the war after he retired?
[02:16:43.543 --> 02:16:51.826]  And it turned out he was paid 500 plus thou a year to go around giving scum speeches saying we're going to go into martial law and the military is going to run America.
[02:16:52.246 --> 02:16:53.827]  That's called high treason, boy!
[02:16:54.938 --> 02:17:03.323]  And you and your Navy friends, and again, most people I talk to, Marines, Navy folks, they're fans, they know the truth, they're upset, they're good people.
[02:17:03.363 --> 02:17:04.383]  We support the military.
[02:17:04.664 --> 02:17:16.450]  But for the type of folks out there that think it's illegal for me to have free speech, and who think military dictatorship is good, if you get between me and my family, you better have some life insurance.
[02:17:17.091 --> 02:17:17.331]  Okay?
[02:17:18.031 --> 02:17:19.473]  Do not try to oppress me.
[02:17:19.773 --> 02:17:21.534]  Do not try to think I'm your slave.
[02:17:21.835 --> 02:17:23.756]  Do not try to take me to a FEMA camp.
[02:17:24.017 --> 02:17:27.640]  Do you understand you un-American disgrace?
[02:17:28.561 --> 02:17:29.802]  You are the un-Americans.
[02:17:30.142 --> 02:17:31.363]  You are the disgrace.
[02:17:31.824 --> 02:17:33.305]  Tommy Franks is a criminal.
[02:17:33.825 --> 02:17:35.106]  What he did was illegal.
[02:17:36.047 --> 02:17:36.748]  It is criminal.
[02:17:36.848 --> 02:17:37.909]  It's been ruled criminal.

[02:18:44.631 --> 02:18:46.532]  Hi, Ted Anderson for Midas Resources.
[02:18:46.552 --> 02:18:47.272]  It's April 3rd, 2007.
[02:18:47.312 --> 02:18:47.852]  Gold is at $662.80.
[02:18:47.892 --> 02:18:50.933]  One ounce gold coins can be purchased for $686.25, $345.68 for half ounce, and $172.84 for quarter ounce coins.

[02:19:03.656 --> 02:19:07.218]  We've been hearing the USA has been spending money faster than tax collections.
[02:19:07.298 --> 02:19:10.299]  Now the government has published the document that sounds the alarm.
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:19.484]  That's right, the United States Government Accountability Office, the GAO, has published the Long-Term Fiscal Outlook document, clearly stating that the federal debt burden is virally out of control.
[02:19:19.784 --> 02:19:25.087]  This will directly affect programs like Social Security to FDIC's ability to insure bank deposits.
[02:19:25.547 --> 02:19:27.828]  Taxation and inflationary printing of the U.S.
[02:19:27.888 --> 02:19:30.330]  dollar are inevitable pressures facing the economy.

[02:19:44.554 --> 02:19:51.039]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X nail gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:19:51.279 --> 02:19:55.302]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:19:55.543 --> 02:19:57.704]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:19:58.064 --> 02:20:05.030]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:20:05.390 --> 02:20:07.991]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:20:08.271 --> 02:20:11.791]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.

[02:20:54.446 --> 02:20:57.609]  Just as prophesied, the judgments upon America have begun.
[02:20:57.849 --> 02:21:01.532]  Yes, the terror attacks of 9-11 opened Revelation's first seal.
[02:21:01.813 --> 02:21:09.359]  In the name of peace and safety, the Rider King has mounted his white horse, waging wars and rumors of war, conquering the Middle East for treasures of oil.

[02:21:52.663 --> 02:21:57.006]  Alright, uh, these anti-Rosie O'Donnell websites
[02:21:58.473 --> 02:22:01.426]  We discovered we're registered through proxies of law firms.
[02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:03.715]  Classic spook behavior.
[02:22:04.961 --> 02:22:14.770]  And then we got a chance to see one of the neocon riders, like a 20-year-old guy, which I'm not knocking young people, it's just that that's the slack-jawed, it's always the same type they've got working for them.
[02:22:15.511 --> 02:22:28.302]  And then they can't get men, or it's like the case of the gay porn stars or, you know, that latest Marine guy, the top gay porn star and gay whore model that the neocons were all pleasuring themselves with.
[02:22:28.362 --> 02:22:29.684]  I mean, I'm sorry, that's just the facts.
[02:22:29.984 --> 02:22:30.965]  Every week it's a new one.
[02:22:31.505 --> 02:22:31.966]  We're good to go.
[02:22:51.417 --> 02:22:54.579]  It says that it could be easily frauded.
[02:22:54.599 --> 02:23:00.483]  It says this petition can be easily frauded and the identity of each individual signee can never be verified.
[02:23:00.523 --> 02:23:01.924]  It's all like a big joke site.
[02:23:02.484 --> 02:23:04.045]  And then it says StopRosie.com.
[02:23:05.306 --> 02:23:12.070]  It says our mission is to influence current and prospective viewers of The View to not watch the program until Rosie O'Donnell is replaced.
[02:23:12.090 --> 02:23:13.851]  So that's saying get her fired.
[02:23:14.192 --> 02:23:16.493]  But down here it says we are not trying to get her fired.
[02:23:17.074 --> 02:23:20.636]  I thought I'd play these guys from the show they were on.
[02:23:22.343 --> 02:23:34.793]  I mean, the individual who radiates, this young man, radiates just... Well, you've got to go watch the video on PrisonPlanet.com or Infowars.com of this guy.
[02:23:34.834 --> 02:23:43.641]  Well, both of them are these little doe, baby-faced, little weak creatures, little spindly creatures you can tell just sit there at their computers all day.
[02:23:44.902 --> 02:23:47.164]  It's just the same folks at Popular Mechanics.
[02:23:47.184 --> 02:23:49.226]  It's just an army of them, and we're going to defeat them.
[02:23:50.291 --> 02:23:54.152]  We're going to defend this country from you neocon scum.
[02:23:55.633 --> 02:24:00.494]  But let's go ahead and roll this clip of the two on there.
[02:24:01.534 --> 02:24:10.457]  Big outrage, our favorite big bully, Rosie O'Donnell, keeps pushing for an investigation into the 9-11 attacks based on her over-the-top 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[02:24:11.037 --> 02:24:13.898]  She says things like, fire can't melt steel.
[02:24:14.710 --> 02:24:15.751]  And that should prove the U.S.
[02:24:15.771 --> 02:24:17.914]  government brought down World Trade Building No.
[02:24:18.314 --> 02:24:19.055]  7 with explosives.
[02:24:19.456 --> 02:24:25.183]  She directly accuses President Bush and the administration of attacking the U.S.
[02:24:25.363 --> 02:24:25.623]  on 9-11.
[02:24:26.584 --> 02:24:29.428]  Listen to this stuff straight from the horse's mouth.
[02:24:30.982 --> 02:24:34.325]  I do believe that it is the first time in history that fire has ever melted steel.
[02:24:34.805 --> 02:24:40.791]  I do believe that it defies physics for the World Trade Center Tower 7, Building 7, which collapsed in on itself.
[02:24:41.151 --> 02:24:44.874]  It is impossible for a building to fall the way it fell without explosives being involved.
[02:24:45.174 --> 02:24:46.375]  World Trade Center 7.
[02:24:47.797 --> 02:24:52.841]  She uses her ABC show, The View, as a platform to push these 9-11 theories.
[02:24:52.861 --> 02:24:56.204]  ABC and Disney are basically allowing her to spew
[02:24:57.165 --> 02:24:59.166]  Left-wing anti-american propaganda.
[02:24:59.306 --> 02:25:02.127]  When will ABC take a stand against this?
[02:25:02.167 --> 02:25:05.509]  With me now, Ethan Zahor, founder of StopRosie.com.
[02:25:05.789 --> 02:25:09.330]  He's spearheading a new online petition to get Rosie off the air.
[02:25:09.531 --> 02:25:13.592]  And also, National Review online columnist, Stephen Spool.
[02:25:13.932 --> 02:25:15.453]  So, Stephen, you first.
[02:25:15.733 --> 02:25:21.796]  All this stuff from Rosie comes from this 9-11 truth movement, which she appears to have
[02:25:22.316 --> 02:25:24.759]  ...have bought into entirely.
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:28.083]  Does that explain all the venom for Bush and the Bush administration?
[02:25:28.931 --> 02:25:31.332]  Well, I think it might be the other way around.
[02:25:31.812 --> 02:25:42.575]  In fact, I think that if you're a pacifist, then it's hard to reconcile the fact that we were attacked on 9-11 by people who hate us and want to kill us.
[02:25:42.635 --> 02:25:47.557]  And so, the mind, I think, in that instance, seeks for alternative explanations.
[02:25:47.617 --> 02:25:56.620]  And if you already hate Bush and think he's the source of everything evil in the world, then he becomes sort of a very convenient, natural culprit to pen the attacks on.
[02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:01.524]  Stephen, StopRosey.com, you're doing an online petition.
[02:26:01.904 --> 02:26:02.124]  Yes.
[02:26:02.665 --> 02:26:04.386]  I'm sorry, Ethan.
[02:26:04.566 --> 02:26:05.187]  Yes.
[02:26:05.327 --> 02:26:06.768]  You're doing an online petition.
[02:26:08.249 --> 02:26:09.390]  Who's signing it and how many?
[02:26:10.151 --> 02:26:10.791]  A lot of people.
[02:26:11.071 --> 02:26:12.953]  Before I came on, we had about a thousand accounts.
[02:26:13.093 --> 02:26:14.954]  The site just went online this morning.
[02:26:16.055 --> 02:26:16.616]  It's getting hits.
[02:26:16.936 --> 02:26:17.657]  Only this morning?
[02:26:17.857 --> 02:26:18.477]  Just this morning.
[02:26:18.837 --> 02:26:18.998]  Yes.
[02:26:19.058 --> 02:26:20.819]  Why did you start this?
[02:26:20.879 --> 02:26:22.380]  And why did you start it this morning?
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:23.521]  I started this weekend.
[02:26:25.592 --> 02:26:29.896]  By the way, if you go on there, it's basically just a message board, it's not even a petition.
[02:26:30.757 --> 02:26:33.820]  If you post anything for Rosie or for free speech, they delete you.
[02:26:34.861 --> 02:26:37.784]  It's nothing but threats and hatred and just garbage.
[02:26:39.205 --> 02:26:42.709]  And you've got these two little, two little tribal-dites on there together.
[02:26:42.729 --> 02:26:49.936]  By the way, there have been big developments in the Rosie O'Donnell situation, and I'm really wondering if I should talk about it or how much I can say.
[02:26:52.682 --> 02:26:53.603]  I'm not going to say much.
[02:26:54.944 --> 02:26:56.125]  Maybe I will in the next segment.
[02:26:56.145 --> 02:26:56.785]  I've got to think about it.
[02:26:56.925 --> 02:26:57.606]  I'll keep rolling it.
[02:26:57.826 --> 02:27:00.088]  Well, we'll break, come back, play the rest of it.
[02:27:00.909 --> 02:27:04.792]  With John Gibson, I mean, he literally is like a blonde-haired Count Dracula or something.
[02:27:05.893 --> 02:27:07.554]  I mean, this guy is such a joke.
[02:27:09.195 --> 02:27:13.098]  Some people I know watch Fox as like entertainment until they roll and laugh.
[02:27:13.238 --> 02:27:13.799]  I can't do it.
[02:27:15.407 --> 02:27:17.468]  I've been at friends' houses who are conservatives, by the way.
[02:27:17.488 --> 02:27:22.549]  They got gun cabinets with, you know, they got automatic weapons licenses and are constantly hunting.
[02:27:22.889 --> 02:27:25.130]  Again, people think that everybody that hates Fox is a liberal.
[02:27:25.170 --> 02:27:25.390]  No, no.
[02:27:25.730 --> 02:27:28.571]  Real conservatives literally roll around laughing.
[02:27:29.191 --> 02:27:29.571]  I don't.
[02:27:29.691 --> 02:27:30.431]  I mean, I cry.
[02:27:31.211 --> 02:27:32.291]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[02:27:34.892 --> 02:27:35.832]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.273 --> 02:27:37.893]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.913 --> 02:27:41.494]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.154 --> 02:27:45.555]  Attention!

[02:28:00.114 --> 02:28:00.474]  I'm good.

[02:28:48.672 --> 02:28:49.533]  Look no further!
[02:28:49.833 --> 02:28:52.395]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[02:28:52.835 --> 02:29:01.260]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:01.821]  We're good to go.
[02:29:19.102 --> 02:29:19.402]  I'm good.
[02:29:44.571 --> 02:29:46.653]  Everyone knows you need magnesium every day.
[02:29:46.674 --> 02:29:49.597]  So calcium supplementation and one source of magnesium.
[02:29:49.757 --> 02:29:58.266]  That just simply isn't enough to give your body the proper nutrition it needs to help keep bones and teeth strong, prevent osteoporosis, and support muscle function.
[02:29:58.487 --> 02:30:02.831]  Now discover the most advanced calcium and magnesium supplement on the market today.

[02:30:13.839 --> 02:30:21.203]  Wachter's Select-Cal 1000 is also packed with other important vitamins and minerals and of course Wachter's special blend of sea vegetation.
[02:30:21.403 --> 02:30:23.724]  Try finding that in your ordinary calcium supplement.

[02:30:41.295 --> 02:30:44.036]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:44.056 --> 02:30:47.959]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:49.860 --> 02:30:51.761]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:51.841 --> 02:30:54.383]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:54.903 --> 02:30:57.865]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:30:58.246 --> 02:31:00.107]  Alright, I got a whole blitz of news I want to cover.
[02:31:01.579 --> 02:31:04.222]  You're noticing that I have been so busy covering news.
[02:31:04.262 --> 02:31:11.870]  I've spent about 60 seconds in the last two and a half hours covering my books and films and the other books and films we carry at Infowars.com.
[02:31:13.072 --> 02:31:22.522]  Be sure and check out the secure online shopping cart if you believe in what we're doing and want to get powerful materials in the fight to get America freedom to fascism or Ritalin Stone or...
[02:31:23.835 --> 02:31:28.478]  Loose Change, Second Edition, 9-11, Mysteries, Demolitions, Part 1.
[02:31:29.139 --> 02:31:31.480]  It's all there at Infowars.com.
[02:31:33.542 --> 02:31:37.464]  Let's go back to literal cartoon propaganda.
[02:31:37.484 --> 02:31:39.485]  The elite is laughing at Fox News.
[02:31:39.586 --> 02:31:44.809]  I mean, the people that watch this, at least CNN is a little more high-grade and it's just as bad or worse.
[02:31:45.770 --> 02:31:47.671]  I mean, it's admittedly run by the CIA.
[02:31:47.811 --> 02:31:48.952]  By the way, look into that.
[02:31:48.992 --> 02:31:49.972]  That's really a true claim.
[02:31:49.992 --> 02:31:50.793]  We don't just say that.
[02:31:51.885 --> 02:32:00.751]  But let's go back to John Gibson, the government operative, there with these two minions, who may be useful idiots.
[02:32:00.791 --> 02:32:01.192]  Who knows?
[02:32:01.232 --> 02:32:01.532]  Here it is.
[02:32:02.045 --> 02:32:03.326]  It took him about a day to design.
[02:32:03.666 --> 02:32:04.446]  It went online.
[02:32:04.846 --> 02:32:05.347]  It got out.
[02:32:05.527 --> 02:32:06.547]  The word got out somehow.
[02:32:06.907 --> 02:32:08.928]  Something must have inspired you on Friday.
[02:32:08.968 --> 02:32:09.469]  What was it?
[02:32:09.969 --> 02:32:17.593]  On Friday, I hear, actually, all the time, I hear all these anti-Rosie comments she makes with the fire melting steel and everything else.
[02:32:17.633 --> 02:32:18.933]  So I said, I want to participate.
[02:32:19.293 --> 02:32:23.255]  I want to do whatever I can to give somebody an outlet to let their voice be heard on it.
[02:32:23.415 --> 02:32:25.436]  For the record, fire does melt steel.
[02:32:26.177 --> 02:32:27.097]  Yes, it does.
[02:32:32.415 --> 02:32:35.016]  For the record, I'm a Chinese jet pilot.
[02:32:35.056 --> 02:32:37.957]  For the record, the moon's made of cheese.
[02:32:37.977 --> 02:32:42.378]  1800 degree jet fuel does not melt steel.
[02:32:44.119 --> 02:32:47.140]  It does not even substantively weaken it.
[02:32:47.600 --> 02:32:51.401]  Underwriting laboratories that underwrote the buildings did a year-long study.
[02:32:52.046 --> 02:33:02.272]  There are the famous photos of men and women waving for help for 20 plus minutes up against four foot around columns, 47 of them, standing there begging for help.
[02:33:03.073 --> 02:33:05.514]  And then you hear the guy on the cell phone going, I'm here, I need your help.
[02:33:05.774 --> 02:33:06.335]  Explosion!
[02:33:06.435 --> 02:33:06.535]  Ah!
[02:33:07.075 --> 02:33:07.876]  And then it cuts out.
[02:33:08.436 --> 02:33:16.981]  Then you see the thing blowing to bits with femur bones flying over a hundred yards across the street on top of buildings.
[02:33:17.021 --> 02:33:19.703]  I mean, bones just blown out of bodies.
[02:33:21.098 --> 02:33:23.060]  I mean, let's magically say fire weakened it.
[02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:28.685]  They would have bent, they would have slumped, they would have crumbled and fallen down, or fallen over.
[02:33:28.705 --> 02:33:28.865]  No, no.
[02:33:29.145 --> 02:33:29.946]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:33:29.986 --> 02:33:30.486]  Top down.
[02:33:30.546 --> 02:33:31.787]  Blowing it up in sections.
[02:33:32.228 --> 02:33:33.409]  Concrete aerosolized.
[02:33:33.449 --> 02:33:36.511]  And then seven perfect bottom down.
[02:33:36.772 --> 02:33:38.073]  They blow the middle column.
[02:33:38.393 --> 02:33:39.614]  You see the penthouse fall.
[02:33:39.994 --> 02:33:41.075]  Then you see squibs.
[02:33:41.135 --> 02:33:41.776]  Boom, boom, boom.
[02:33:41.816 --> 02:33:42.357]  Up the sides.
[02:33:42.397 --> 02:33:44.578]  I mean, you even got blast squibs.
[02:33:44.679 --> 02:33:44.899]  I mean,
[02:33:45.459 --> 02:33:50.343]  And then you've got all the firefighters and police saying we were told to get back, that we're going to blow it up.
[02:33:50.704 --> 02:34:05.036]  And about the lava and the... I mean, if you think 1,800 degree jet fuel that won't melt people begging for help turns steel into lava, folks, and has it two and a half months later at 2,500 degrees, it's just amazing.
[02:34:05.456 --> 02:34:06.417]  Let's finish up.
[02:34:06.958 --> 02:34:07.938]  Back it up a few seconds.
[02:34:07.958 --> 02:34:10.020]  I want them to hear Gibson.
[02:34:10.841 --> 02:34:11.922]  Now, Rob,
[02:34:13.249 --> 02:34:14.570]  Non-structural steel.
[02:34:14.650 --> 02:34:40.028]  When iron has had enough coke put in it, and had enough air injected into it to change the molecules, and go into how steel is made, weak, you know, basic, non-structural steel, okay, that's just left the grate of iron, doesn't begin to melt, okay, and they consider melting just, you know, oozing, starting to, you know, that's what's considered.
[02:34:40.879 --> 02:34:44.640]  I mean, you can turn the stuff into gas if you want, or you can turn it into the equivalent of liquid.
[02:34:45.320 --> 02:34:46.500]  And that takes a lot more.
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:48.160]  Let me give you the exact temperature.
[02:34:48.180 --> 02:34:49.681]  2,774 degrees.
[02:34:49.701 --> 02:34:49.681]  2,774.
[02:34:49.741 --> 02:34:56.122]  Now, guess what structure will steel begins to melt at?
[02:34:56.142 --> 02:34:56.542]  3,300 plus.
[02:34:56.602 --> 02:34:57.842]  Just type in melt temp of steel into Google.
[02:34:58.442 --> 02:35:00.283]  You'll get all the universities, all the studies.
[02:35:09.105 --> 02:35:13.488]  And so Gibson is up here just saying, everybody knows the Earth is flat.
[02:35:13.909 --> 02:35:19.233]  Everybody knows that Pluto, you know, is a dog orbiting the Sun.
[02:35:19.873 --> 02:35:22.035]  I mean, thank you, John Gibson.
[02:35:22.415 --> 02:35:25.337]  Now you will tell us that H2O is Mercury.
[02:35:25.658 --> 02:35:26.098]  Here he is.
[02:35:27.039 --> 02:35:30.161]  The fire melting steel and everything else, so I said, I want to participate.
[02:35:30.501 --> 02:35:34.464]  I want to do whatever I can to give somebody an outlet to let their voice be heard on it.
[02:35:34.644 --> 02:35:36.246]  For the record, fire does melt steel.
[02:35:37.362 --> 02:35:37.602]  Yes.
[02:35:38.803 --> 02:35:49.291]  ABC, are they essentially endorsing Rosie's views by letting her stay on the view and continue to spout this stuff every day?
[02:35:49.671 --> 02:35:59.338]  Well, I think that somebody at ABC has a very sick sense of humor letting this clearly unwell person go on TV and continue to
[02:35:59.898 --> 02:36:00.218]  Stop again.
[02:36:29.551 --> 02:36:33.013]  The government has never put out an official report about what happened.
[02:36:33.033 --> 02:36:34.895]  They put out a report and speculate.
[02:36:35.435 --> 02:36:37.816]  They give five different reasons that the towers fell.
[02:36:39.778 --> 02:36:43.360]  Bin Laden is not on the FBI most wanted list for 9-11.
[02:36:46.842 --> 02:36:52.306]  And we have a bunch of declassified documents where our government admittedly has staged terror attacks in the past.
[02:36:53.621 --> 02:36:54.942]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[02:36:54.982 --> 02:37:03.366]  I mean, maybe these are just young, dumb, one of them writes for a neocon publication, the other one looks so goofy, he probably is just a young Republican frat boy.
[02:37:03.386 --> 02:37:11.670]  And, you know, frankly, earlier in my life, I pretty much fit that bill too.
[02:37:12.130 --> 02:37:16.212]  But you're stupid, and you don't know what you're talking about.
[02:37:17.213 --> 02:37:19.254]  But at least when I was a young Republican,
[02:37:19.901 --> 02:37:25.264]  You know, at least, and I wasn't physically or officially a member, but I hung around with all those people in college and stuff.
[02:37:25.724 --> 02:37:30.908]  You know, I was into the Federal Reserve being private and lower taxes, and I was more of a Ron Paul type Republican.
[02:37:31.188 --> 02:37:32.649]  You guys are disgusting!
[02:37:34.069 --> 02:37:40.093]  I mean, and you always talk about American haters and how we want to hurt the troops, we want to aid the terrorists, and that's what you say on your website.
[02:37:41.989 --> 02:37:44.190]  I don't take vacations with the Bin Laden family.
[02:37:44.510 --> 02:37:48.491]  I'm not an owner of the Carlisle Group like the Bushes and the Bin Ladens and Queen Elizabeth.
[02:37:48.571 --> 02:37:49.811]  I mean, that's Wall Street Journal.
[02:37:50.611 --> 02:37:54.913]  The Wall Street Journal, two months before 9-11, called for Bush Sr.
[02:37:54.933 --> 02:37:57.753]  to stop vacationing with the Bin Ladens and stop being in business with them.
[02:38:00.194 --> 02:38:02.175]  The Bin Ladens have been British intelligence since 1918.
[02:38:02.295 --> 02:38:07.536]  And they always cite Hearst Publishing, Popular Mechanics.
[02:38:08.076 --> 02:38:11.137]  Literally, go get an encyclopedia off the wall.
[02:38:12.159 --> 02:38:18.702]  The three or four I've looked at, when you look up Yellow Journalism, it says synonymous with Hearst Publishing.
[02:38:19.122 --> 02:38:20.403]  They've always been evil.
[02:38:20.743 --> 02:38:24.765]  They pioneered government fronts, okay?
[02:38:25.725 --> 02:38:36.290]  The Homeland Security's first cousin wrote the piece, organized the piece, and lied to me over the phone and swore it was not a hit piece and not a debunking exercise.
[02:38:36.591 --> 02:38:37.791]  They are liars!
[02:38:38.652 --> 02:38:41.353]  And then he lied to American Free Press
[02:38:42.435 --> 02:39:00.079]  Benjamin Chertoff of the Homeland Security Director's family, and said, I'm not related to Michael Chertoff, and then his mommy was called by the American Free Press, and his mommy said, oh yeah, of course Homeland Security Director comes to our house, you know, every month for dinner.
[02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:02.720]  Oh yes, he's his first cousins.
[02:39:04.782 --> 02:39:06.343]  Oh yes, he came to the Bar Mitzvah.
[02:39:06.443 --> 02:39:09.025]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[02:39:09.605 --> 02:39:10.386]  And they lied!
[02:39:10.706 --> 02:39:13.929]  He went on national radio and said, I'm not related to him.
[02:39:14.109 --> 02:39:16.951]  And it turns out, they're close family friends.
[02:39:20.773 --> 02:39:25.276]  And I bet that Benjamin Chertoff, well we know, we know he's a dual citizen.
[02:39:26.357 --> 02:39:27.198]  I mean, I'm sick of it!
[02:39:28.058 --> 02:39:28.819]  I'm tired of it!
[02:39:30.174 --> 02:39:30.774]  I'm tired of it.
[02:39:30.855 --> 02:39:38.880]  I don't like the fact that here in Texas, the Governor's Head of Border and Mexico Affairs is a Mexican citizen and a registered lobbyist of the government of Mexico.
[02:39:39.381 --> 02:39:46.506]  And I don't like the fact that a big part of our intelligence apparatchik and security apparatchik is Israeli Mossad operatives.
[02:39:47.707 --> 02:39:54.231]  I mean, hell, Michael Chertoff's mother was one of the founders of Mossad.
[02:39:54.291 --> 02:39:56.393]  I mean, God, we're in trouble.
[02:39:57.407 --> 02:40:05.811]  And we've got slack-jawed young punks on TV who don't know anything up there defending George Bush.
[02:40:07.272 --> 02:40:09.393]  And man, every time I look at Hillary, I almost throw up.
[02:40:10.053 --> 02:40:11.554]  I was on the exercise bike yesterday.
[02:40:11.574 --> 02:40:16.536]  I ran to the gym, got on the bike, and I'm sitting there, and it's Hillary, just constant.
[02:40:16.556 --> 02:40:17.937]  I'm reading the text on the screen.
[02:40:18.697 --> 02:40:21.099]  It's closed captions for an hour, 45 minutes an hour.
[02:40:23.494 --> 02:40:25.815]  And, uh, I mean, I literally just couldn't take it anymore.
[02:40:25.835 --> 02:40:26.575]  I had to look down.
[02:40:26.595 --> 02:40:28.135]  I wish I wouldn't have sat in front of a TV.
[02:40:28.175 --> 02:40:31.136]  You know, they got them for every three bikes, they got a TV hanging down.
[02:40:33.036 --> 02:40:34.556]  And it was just the same regurgitation.
[02:40:34.616 --> 02:40:36.477]  Let's analyze the Republican candidates.
[02:40:36.857 --> 02:40:38.557]  Let's analyze the Democratic candidates.
[02:40:38.617 --> 02:40:40.137]  And I know about every one of them.
[02:40:41.378 --> 02:40:48.619]  Mip Romney, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, uh, Senator Hagel,
[02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:59.999]  Every one of them is a New World Order vetted, selected, bred, trained New World Order.
[02:41:00.480 --> 02:41:02.282]  I mean, they win either way.
[02:41:02.322 --> 02:41:12.772]  It's like watching a horse race where there's ten horses running and the same gangster owns every one of them and owns the jockeys and it's going to be a staged event and they're going to win money on every one of them, guessing the right place.
[02:41:15.777 --> 02:41:18.698]  It's like watching a Don King-sponsored boxing match.
[02:41:18.758 --> 02:41:23.481]  I mean, you know, and you're still idiots that buy, you know, a hundred bucks for pay-per-view to watch it.
[02:41:26.062 --> 02:41:34.605]  It'd be like watching a baseball game that was being officiated and being judged by Pete Rose and betting on it.
[02:41:36.947 --> 02:41:38.847]  I mean, I don't know what's wrong with you out there.
[02:41:38.867 --> 02:41:42.009]  I have a lot of trouble under... I mean, it's just... it's just...
[02:41:46.036 --> 02:41:46.516]  I hate her!
[02:41:48.957 --> 02:41:54.458]  She hangs out with the Bushes, has dinner every week with Roger Ailes, Limbaugh's boss and the head of Fox News.
[02:41:54.898 --> 02:41:58.759]  They've been doing campaign finance raising for her for four years quietly.
[02:41:59.059 --> 02:42:02.500]  It finally broke, and I read these neocon blogs and they say, that's okay.
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:04.040]  That's okay.
[02:42:04.100 --> 02:42:05.040]  I mean, you're scum.
[02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:06.180]  You're not conservatives.
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:07.161]  Stop posing.
[02:42:07.221 --> 02:42:13.902]  Most of you are just trying to get cushy CIA or Defense Department jobs in domestic propaganda, and a lot of you are getting it.
[02:42:14.634 --> 02:42:17.155]  I mean, you know, it's turned out it's over $20 billion.
[02:42:17.335 --> 02:42:22.817]  That was one group of fake news purchasing that was $1.8 billion.
[02:42:24.677 --> 02:42:25.178]  I was wrong.
[02:42:25.238 --> 02:42:27.038]  The news stuff, that was $1.8, it wasn't $1.6.
[02:42:28.879 --> 02:42:33.760]  You've got almost $25 billion that we know of now since Bush has been in, in fake news.
[02:42:33.840 --> 02:42:38.022]  I mean, buying reporters, folks, and having them write what the government tells them to write.
[02:42:39.468 --> 02:42:41.810]  There's no doubt O'Reilly's on the payroll.
[02:42:41.850 --> 02:42:44.451]  There's no doubt Gibson's on the payroll.
[02:42:44.832 --> 02:42:55.719]  There's no doubt Rush Limbaugh's show, he is paid with his, what was it, $280-something million dollar contract.
[02:42:55.759 --> 02:42:56.200]  Yeah, $287 million.
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:59.182]  He's paid more than his show makes for his network.
[02:43:04.782 --> 02:43:13.408]  And they've even done calculations where it looks like his show, he's paid more by himself than what affiliates would make.
[02:43:13.428 --> 02:43:14.409]  Because, you know, that's split.
[02:43:14.649 --> 02:43:17.051]  Affiliates get half the ads and the network gets half the ads.
[02:43:17.591 --> 02:43:23.876]  I mean, my God, folks, when someone's being paid far more than their show even makes, what do you think it is?
[02:43:27.598 --> 02:43:30.760]  I mean, this is no-brain stuff.
[02:43:32.562 --> 02:43:33.863]  It isn't freedom.
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:43.562]  It isn't an open society when the Pentagon and the CIA aren't just paying for reporters in Baghdad, they're paying for them in your town!
[02:43:45.082 --> 02:43:54.965]  I've got CIA action reports from 1953, where Kermit Roosevelt is writing to the President and writing to Tim Downing Street, addressing them both as his bosses.
[02:43:56.125 --> 02:43:59.846]  He's even more deferential and subservient to Tim Downing Street.
[02:44:01.802 --> 02:44:03.703]  Because that's when the real merger accelerated.
[02:44:03.723 --> 02:44:13.190]  And he's sitting there going, oh yes, all our reporters and editors and Time and Time Live Books and everywhere, we need to really use them more to keep overthrowing companies.
[02:44:13.210 --> 02:44:14.171]  This works great!
[02:44:15.852 --> 02:44:16.973]  This works great!
[02:44:18.414 --> 02:44:24.639]  And I have to sit there and watch the Homeland Security produce Popular Mechanic's garbage.
[02:44:25.199 --> 02:44:29.943]  And they're lying left and right, they're full of bull, and I want to warn the public!
[02:44:30.658 --> 02:44:32.839]  I mean, this stuff's real, ladies and gentlemen!
[02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:36.622]  It's not, well, Alex is right about a lot of this, but he goes a little too far.
[02:44:36.982 --> 02:44:38.483]  You know, things aren't really that bad.
[02:44:39.164 --> 02:44:39.904]  Things are okay.
[02:44:39.944 --> 02:44:41.205]  No, they're not, okay?
[02:44:41.225 --> 02:44:43.406]  I cannot tell you how bad it is.
[02:44:44.827 --> 02:44:45.988]  I read hundreds of articles a day.
[02:44:46.188 --> 02:44:48.149]  I've probably got 50, 60 of them a day in front of me.
[02:44:48.410 --> 02:44:50.211]  I've got probably 50 I didn't cover yesterday.
[02:44:50.731 --> 02:44:52.532]  I've got a stack right here of incredible stuff.
[02:44:52.552 --> 02:44:56.555]  There's no way to even... I mean, folks, this stuff's so nuts just on the science front.
[02:44:58.624 --> 02:45:00.745]  You know, bees eat pollen.
[02:45:00.866 --> 02:45:01.966]  They eat pollen.
[02:45:02.607 --> 02:45:05.569]  And they regurgitate it after they've taken the sugar out of it and make honey.
[02:45:06.609 --> 02:45:07.570]  That's why there's so much.
[02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:08.931]  I don't see bees anymore.
[02:45:08.951 --> 02:45:11.313]  When I was a kid, there were bees all over the place.
[02:45:14.014 --> 02:45:15.996]  Diabetes is up by several thousand percent.
[02:45:16.036 --> 02:45:18.978]  It's not just the corn syrup.
[02:45:19.958 --> 02:45:20.959]  Cancer's way up.
[02:45:21.179 --> 02:45:23.701]  All this crazy stuff's happening.
[02:45:23.921 --> 02:45:26.463]  They've got cross-species goats, sheep,
[02:45:27.223 --> 02:45:33.945]  Spider goats, human goats, human chimpanzees, body parts, random genetic splicing.
[02:45:34.265 --> 02:45:36.085]  I mean, you think this dog food stuff's bad?
[02:45:36.105 --> 02:45:40.087]  People are dying every day from GMO foods, and the doctors are told how to diagnose it.
[02:45:40.107 --> 02:45:40.627]  They don't know.
[02:45:40.707 --> 02:45:52.750]  Your kidneys failed, your liver failed, you're 25 years old, your two-year-old's got... I mean, I remember in the other neighborhood I lived in, on the little block I lived on, in one year, three babies, three toddlers died of leukemia and cancer.
[02:45:53.634 --> 02:45:55.895]  And other kids had autism, and I talked to the people.
[02:45:55.915 --> 02:45:57.336]  I remember your kid was out running around.
[02:45:57.356 --> 02:45:58.116]  They got autism now?
[02:45:58.437 --> 02:45:59.477]  Yeah, at 18 months.
[02:45:59.517 --> 02:46:01.478]  I go, let me guess, he had a seizure after the shots?
[02:46:01.538 --> 02:46:01.858]  Yeah.
[02:46:02.299 --> 02:46:04.120]  You know, I mean, I'm living in hell here, folks.
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:05.580]  I know what's going on.
[02:46:06.121 --> 02:46:07.321]  I mean, I see it around me.
[02:46:07.361 --> 02:46:11.183]  We're living in a, you know, in a nightmare horror movie.
[02:46:12.244 --> 02:46:12.684]  And I gotta...
[02:46:16.593 --> 02:46:19.094]  But again, it's the illusion of the TV, and the movies, and the culture.
[02:46:19.114 --> 02:46:22.996]  Everything's fine, and it's coated like a candy apple, but the apple's poison.
[02:46:23.296 --> 02:46:31.781]  But it's got the caramel on the outside, and it's just, and you know, the roads are manicured, and the billboards, and the flashing lights, and everybody goes about their business.
[02:46:31.841 --> 02:46:33.962]  We are in a trance, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:46:34.342 --> 02:46:40.485]  And around us, they're grabbing people's kids, the police are arresting everybody, they're passing all these new laws, building prisons everywhere.
[02:46:42.279 --> 02:46:52.327]  I mean, the news I've got here in front of me, there's a AP article where they say that kids that aren't vaccinated make other kids get sick.
[02:46:52.547 --> 02:46:53.188]  Common sense.
[02:46:53.228 --> 02:46:56.871]  If you believe in this toxic poison, your kid's taking it, they're protected.
[02:46:57.671 --> 02:46:59.793]  My kid not having the shot doesn't infect your kid.
[02:46:59.813 --> 02:47:01.294]  That's a 101 lie.
[02:47:01.695 --> 02:47:04.157]  But the general public, they can't do 2 plus 2 anymore.
[02:47:05.618 --> 02:47:06.999]  They're gone, folks, they're gone!
[02:47:08.158 --> 02:47:08.939]  Ah, here's another one.
[02:47:09.479 --> 02:47:10.640]  Wall Street Journal today.
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:12.761]  Best Buy looks to RFID chips.
[02:47:13.321 --> 02:47:18.465]  Electronics retailer Best Buy foresees a day when most of the merchandise will be tagged by radio frequency.
[02:47:18.945 --> 02:47:22.027]  Well, I won't be going to your steak and store anymore.
[02:47:23.328 --> 02:47:26.370]  Biometrics cash machines bring joy, BBC.
[02:47:26.690 --> 02:47:27.490]  Listen to these articles.
[02:47:27.751 --> 02:47:29.592]  It brings joy!
[02:47:29.612 --> 02:47:32.754]  I mean, it's written for low-grade morons!
[02:47:33.621 --> 02:47:39.382]  You just heard a top IT financial crimes expert, one of the top in the country, telling you this stuff's horrible.
[02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:41.083]  This stuff's designed for fraud.
[02:47:41.123 --> 02:47:44.284]  But see, they'll have even more control when the fraud gets worse.
[02:47:45.524 --> 02:47:45.744]  See?
[02:47:47.344 --> 02:47:49.005]  It's always problem, reaction, solution.
[02:47:49.065 --> 02:47:50.205]  The solution makes it worse.
[02:47:50.445 --> 02:47:51.946]  They've got another solution that makes it worse.
[02:47:52.206 --> 02:47:53.546]  Another solution makes it worse.
[02:47:54.546 --> 02:47:56.367]  See, they mean to screw up with the drug war.
[02:47:56.527 --> 02:47:57.967]  They mean to screw up in Baghdad.
[02:47:58.127 --> 02:47:58.947]  That's how they stay.
[02:47:58.967 --> 02:47:59.848]  That's how they expand.
[02:47:59.888 --> 02:48:01.168]  It's how they get more control.
[02:48:03.004 --> 02:48:03.724]  Oh, we screwed up.
[02:48:03.744 --> 02:48:04.425]  Give us more power.
[02:48:04.805 --> 02:48:05.385]  Oh, we screwed up.
[02:48:05.405 --> 02:48:06.005]  Give us more power.
[02:48:06.245 --> 02:48:10.707]  Got the head of Visa saying by 2012 there'll be no cash and they're dead serious.
[02:48:11.007 --> 02:48:12.687]  They got ads demonizing cash.
[02:48:17.409 --> 02:48:17.689]  U.S.
[02:48:17.729 --> 02:48:23.071]  judge affirms Americans must have criminal checks before contacting foreigners on Internet.
[02:48:23.191 --> 02:48:25.192]  I mean, this is mainstream news.
[02:48:26.392 --> 02:48:28.953]  Civilians could be facing mandatory anthrax shots.
[02:48:28.973 --> 02:48:31.074]  I mean, this is the type of stuff
[02:48:32.446 --> 02:48:36.348]  TB patient locked up maybe for life, but keep those borders open.
[02:48:36.848 --> 02:48:37.828]  We'll cover when we get back.
[02:48:39.549 --> 02:48:49.193]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:49.573 --> 02:48:57.176]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:57.907 --> 02:49:04.971]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:05.371 --> 02:49:16.797]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:17.097 --> 02:49:21.020]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:21.060 --> 02:49:23.001]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:23.321 --> 02:49:27.103]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:41.215 --> 02:50:47.999]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:50:48.359 --> 02:50:54.763]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:50:55.244 --> 02:51:05.150]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:51:05.630 --> 02:51:09.092]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:51:09.392 --> 02:51:12.074]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.

[02:52:01.552 --> 02:52:06.316]  Tuberculosis in this country was almost extinct 20 years ago.
[02:52:07.016 --> 02:52:10.499]  Now it is officially an epidemic, but it's kept very quiet.
[02:52:10.919 --> 02:52:18.065]  It's drug-resistant, extreme drug-resistant, and in Russia they're calling it drug-immune TB, and that's already here.
[02:52:19.037 --> 02:52:22.178]  And they've had federal numbers on this that came out a couple years ago.
[02:52:22.898 --> 02:52:30.299]  One person with TB in a school or office setting will give, in one year, close to 40 people.
[02:52:30.319 --> 02:52:32.940]  It's between 34 and 40, if memory serves.
[02:52:33.660 --> 02:52:37.561]  But the point is, well over 30 people will get TB.
[02:52:38.701 --> 02:52:42.582]  The illegal aliens come in with drug immune, extreme drug resistant, you name it.
[02:52:43.508 --> 02:52:50.811]  And all over, they have opened whole floors, whole areas, whole facilities with these sanitariums, as they're called.
[02:52:51.151 --> 02:52:56.874]  And I have articles here, and they lock you up, folks, and nobody comes in, and nobody sees you, and it says, maybe for life.
[02:52:58.195 --> 02:53:02.176]  Now, when the people came into Dallas Island, folks, they tested them for it.
[02:53:02.957 --> 02:53:03.917]  And that was the old stuff.
[02:53:04.457 --> 02:53:05.778]  Not now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:06.358 --> 02:53:08.239]  And you try calling the news when your daughter
[02:53:09.292 --> 02:53:10.673]  Sitting next to that illegal alien.
[02:53:11.233 --> 02:53:16.936]  We had three cases of leprosy in the hundred years before 2005.
[02:53:17.216 --> 02:53:23.139]  We had 7,060 something cases and they've opened a leper colony in Texas.
[02:53:23.979 --> 02:53:26.040]  Yes, we now have leprosy, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:27.980]  We now have leprosy.
[02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:37.682]  By the way, I've been in convenience stores and places, and I've seen the foreigners, and I know what leprosy looks like, and I've seen them with pieces of their nose rotten off, and I've looked at their hands and seen a finger withering.
[02:53:37.882 --> 02:53:40.783]  There's folks walking around with leprosy all over the place.
[02:53:42.083 --> 02:53:44.384]  Oh, but they got you scared, don't they?
[02:53:45.084 --> 02:53:47.244]  They got you scared of Al-Qaeda, don't they?
[02:53:47.784 --> 02:53:49.725]  Folks, look at this.
[02:53:50.045 --> 02:53:50.345]  U.S.
[02:53:50.385 --> 02:53:52.185]  judge affirms I.M.B.R.A.
[02:53:52.485 --> 02:53:54.786]  Americans must have criminal background checks before
[02:53:55.544 --> 02:53:57.385]  Contacting Fires on the Internet.
[02:53:58.146 --> 02:53:59.307]  They'll just announce that power.
[02:53:59.947 --> 02:54:03.069]  International Marriage Broker Regulation Act, and it goes on.
[02:54:03.249 --> 02:54:05.931]  But then that's for everybody, saying you want to contact anybody you've got to.
[02:54:06.772 --> 02:54:07.392]  Here's another one.
[02:54:07.692 --> 02:54:08.713]  This is World Net Daily.
[02:54:08.953 --> 02:54:12.295]  Civilians could be facing... Notice the government calls us civilians now.
[02:54:12.415 --> 02:54:13.256]  It's the military.
[02:54:13.916 --> 02:54:15.157]  They were always civilians, too.
[02:54:15.177 --> 02:54:16.398]  See, they're changing all the words.
[02:54:17.768 --> 02:54:20.231]  Civilians could be facing mandatory anthrax shots.
[02:54:20.311 --> 02:54:23.574]  Expert warns government has 10 million doses for emergency.
[02:54:24.095 --> 02:54:27.618]  And they go on to announce that they do have a program to forcibly inoculate.
[02:54:27.638 --> 02:54:28.139]  You're getting ready.
[02:54:29.395 --> 02:54:30.275]  Here's the one I mentioned.
[02:54:30.636 --> 02:54:38.360]  TB patient locked up, maybe for life, behind the county hospital, tall cinder block walls.
[02:54:38.400 --> 02:54:44.983]  A 27-year-old tuberculosis patient sits in a jail cell equipped with a ventilation system that keeps germs from escaping.
[02:54:45.303 --> 02:54:49.045]  Robert Gamble's been locked up indefinitely, perhaps the rest of his life, since last July.
[02:54:49.065 --> 02:54:49.645]  And it goes on.
[02:54:49.985 --> 02:54:53.087]  He has highly drug-resistant TB.
[02:54:55.072 --> 02:54:56.093]  And that's it.
[02:54:56.874 --> 02:54:58.795]  And it goes on to say it's spreading globally.
[02:54:59.276 --> 02:55:03.539]  Coming out of Russia, coming out of Mexico, coming out of China, coming out of Africa.
[02:55:04.741 --> 02:55:06.622]  There's no medical checks when they come in.
[02:55:07.483 --> 02:55:12.087]  But CPS is announcing they're going to force medical checks on anybody who's in Head Start, though.
[02:55:12.537 --> 02:55:17.599]  And you're going to have a cop pull you over to the checkpoint and go, THINGS HAVE CHANGED AFTER 9-11!
[02:55:17.799 --> 02:55:21.600]  AL-QAEDA HIT US AND HIT US HARD!
[02:55:21.640 --> 02:55:24.661]  YOU NEED TO SWITCH LANGUAGE!
[02:55:24.681 --> 02:55:27.122]  I HOPE YOU HAVE A HANDGUN HERE!
[02:55:27.142 --> 02:55:30.483]  I'M GOING TO HAVE TO RUIN YOUR LIFE NOW!
[02:55:31.503 --> 02:55:31.823]  Fine.
[02:55:31.864 --> 02:55:33.044]  You're going to lose your pension fund.
[02:55:33.084 --> 02:55:34.805]  They're going to shoot your kids up with mercury.
[02:55:35.165 --> 02:55:36.905]  So you go ahead and you serve the system.
[02:55:36.945 --> 02:55:37.685]  Don't listen to me.
[02:55:38.006 --> 02:55:39.266]  Call me a traitor, scum.
[02:55:39.286 --> 02:55:42.027]  You want to fight these people?

[02:56:04.069 --> 02:56:06.610]  96% of it, on average, we've had them count them out.
[02:56:07.190 --> 02:56:09.611]  I mean, you talk about lean and mean, folks, we are.
[02:56:09.971 --> 02:56:11.111]  We're all about the fight.
