[00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:06.389]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:09.991]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.571 --> 00:00:11.412]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.152 --> 00:00:13.032]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:17.534]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:22.016]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.438 --> 00:00:27.759]  It is the 20th day of September 2007.
[00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:43.698]  If you are looking for the InfoWar, if you are looking for the front lines in the fight for liberty and freedom worldwide, the tip of the spear, my friends, you have parachuted right into the middle of it.
[00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.623]  I'm Alex Jones, your InfoWarrior.
[00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:50.122]  Here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:50.142 --> 00:00:51.724]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:53.407]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:53.847 --> 00:00:59.775]  Going out on a growing list of wonderful AM and FM affiliates across the country.
[00:01:00.216 --> 00:01:05.403]  The latest 1330 out of Cameron, Texas covering Waco and much of Austin, Texas.
[00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:07.370]  1330 a.m.
[00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:20.716]  simulcasting on three different satellites, the internet at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and WWCR 11 to 2 Central and retransmitted 9 to midnight Central.
[00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:25.578]  That's when the network retransmits this is 9 to midnight and then again at 1 a.m.
[00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:26.278]  to 4 a.m.
[00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:29.740]  But you can listen 24 hours a day to the internet streams
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.503]  21 hours a day, we restream until the live show starts again and that's at 2 p.m.
[00:01:34.543 --> 00:01:34.884]  Central.
[00:01:34.904 --> 00:01:50.615]  If you missed any of the show, you can always tune in and listen during the restreams, the refeeds, or you can simply go to InfoWars.com and subscribe to the free podcast to your MP3 or iPod device and listen how you want, where you want, when you want, giving you full control.
[00:01:52.737 --> 00:01:57.260]  Not just over when and how you listen, but also when it comes to sharing it with others.
[00:01:58.308 --> 00:02:00.609]  All right, very important broadcast.
[00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:07.310]  As the events get more and more serious, as things accelerate, every day just gets more amazing here.
[00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.532]  Every day we're seeing bigger financial moves than a few years ago we would see in a full year.
[00:02:13.552 --> 00:02:20.613]  I mean, the events taking place every day are earth-shaking when it comes to the financial world.
[00:02:20.993 --> 00:02:27.075]  And then, of course, the financial world touches us in every sector of our lives and every other facet of society.
[00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:30.241]  So we'll be going through that.
[00:02:30.382 --> 00:02:32.002]  Fears of dollar collapses.
[00:02:32.062 --> 00:02:33.863]  Saudis take fright.
[00:02:35.243 --> 00:02:38.764]  Dollar hits new all-time low against the Euro every week.
[00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:40.244]  The further plunge continues.
[00:02:40.684 --> 00:02:44.025]  Bernanke, federal act to curb fallout of credit bills.
[00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:47.986]  Yeah, give us more rope to have a longer drop.
[00:02:49.027 --> 00:02:52.368]  Oil hovers at 82 a barrel on worries of supply crunch.
[00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:53.388]  Total propaganda.
[00:02:53.828 --> 00:02:54.088]  U.S.
[00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:56.609]  retailers see weak growth this holiday season.
[00:02:59.142 --> 00:03:01.443]  Dollar tumbles against the Canadian dollar.
[00:03:01.923 --> 00:03:05.045]  It's now worth more than the dollar for the first time in history.
[00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:24.675]  This is what we're dealing with, but the yuppies are dancing around because the stock market went up, which is an illusionary gauge, an illusionary graph, an illusionary meter, an illusionary speedometer, however you want to put it.
[00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:29.293]  I first discovered this about eight years ago.
[00:03:29.313 --> 00:03:30.373]  This is what I'm going to cover first.
[00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:33.335]  I'll get into financial news, bottom of the hour, in about 25 minutes.
[00:03:34.596 --> 00:03:38.658]  I first saw this in Tucson, Arizona in the Star.
[00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.519]  They're in their paper.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.541]  I then saw it in Texas.
[00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:44.302]  I then saw it in New York, California.
[00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:45.603]  Then England.
[00:03:46.523 --> 00:03:54.288]  And I would cover mainline news articles eight years ago and get emails and calls and people would laugh at me and say that I was making this up.
[00:03:54.348 --> 00:03:55.809]  They wouldn't go check out my claims.
[00:03:56.551 --> 00:03:58.032]  They would just say it wasn't true.
[00:04:00.093 --> 00:04:01.413]  Here's World Net Daily, folks.
[00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:08.277]  Highway Checkpoint asks drivers for blood, saliva, travelers outraged by private research group's request.
[00:04:08.637 --> 00:04:16.481]  And they have police there trying to intimidate them, trying to threaten them into giving blood and saliva.
[00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:18.422]  And of course, the public's ignorant.
[00:04:18.442 --> 00:04:19.522]  It's not saliva.
[00:04:20.383 --> 00:04:24.465]  They're swabbing the inner cheek, the largest cells in the body.
[00:04:25.487 --> 00:04:29.850]  It's like an amoeba single cell, and thousands of times the size of a red blood cell.
[00:04:31.111 --> 00:04:33.934]  Well, they're not amoeba size, but they're big.
[00:04:35.235 --> 00:04:36.055]  Inside the cheek.
[00:04:37.216 --> 00:04:40.078]  And that's where they get them, for their DNA databases.
[00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:43.001]  And so, this is back in the news.
[00:04:44.662 --> 00:04:46.383]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:47.024 --> 00:04:47.704]  Get into this.
[00:04:47.784 --> 00:04:52.228]  It's all part of the National DNA Database, International DNA Database.
[00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:53.609]  If you're 34 years old, you're in it.
[00:04:54.375 --> 00:04:56.064]  We'll explain why and how when we get back.
[00:05:01.383 --> 00:05:06.465]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:05:06.525 --> 00:05:13.848]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:05:13.988 --> 00:05:24.652]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:05:24.832 --> 00:05:29.374]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:05:29.654 --> 00:05:34.635]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:37.796]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:38.016 --> 00:05:47.739]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:53.420]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.881]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:06:01.202 --> 00:06:04.682]  It's here.
[00:06:04.922 --> 00:06:09.703]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.063 --> 00:06:17.705]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.402 --> 00:06:25.446]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:37.272]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.592 --> 00:06:41.454]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:43.476]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.816 --> 00:06:47.658]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:02.123 --> 00:07:03.323]  Want to know my little secret?
[00:07:03.884 --> 00:07:08.325]  I have rich, delicious chocolate as much as I want, every single day.
[00:07:08.765 --> 00:07:10.405]  And I never feel bad about it.
[00:07:10.886 --> 00:07:15.707]  Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea gives you real, natural cocoa, without any fat or sugar.
[00:07:16.467 --> 00:07:23.409]  Even better, Cocoa Pure is made with nutrients that keep my heart healthy, my energy levels up, and my body looking great.
[00:07:23.989 --> 00:07:29.031]  I'm having smooth, tasty chocolate every single day, and it's helping me stay healthier than ever.
[00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:33.935]  You can give yourself the gift of health by calling for a bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:37.177]  The only thing better than chocolate is healthy chocolate.
[00:07:37.658 --> 00:07:41.261]  Here's how you can get a bottle of delicious Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea.
[00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:45.724]  For your risk-free bottle of Cocoa Pure Chocolate Tea, call 1-800-894-3596.
[00:07:45.744 --> 00:07:52.810]  And if you call now, you can find out how to get a free bottle of Cocoa Pure with your order.
[00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.210]  Call 1-800-894-3596.
[00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:53.490]  That's 1-800-894-3596.
[00:08:01.152 --> 00:08:06.173]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.553 --> 00:08:08.874]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:12.694 --> 00:08:18.916]  Alright, we got SWAT teams raiding the Amish, terrorizing children.
[00:08:21.936 --> 00:08:27.478]  We've got the police out trying to tell people they've got to give blood and saliva checkpoints, randomly.
[00:08:28.118 --> 00:08:29.578]  This has been going on a long time.
[00:08:31.192 --> 00:08:32.172]  It's back in the news.
[00:08:33.273 --> 00:08:38.434]  They admit that the pneumonia vaccine has spurred a superbug that's killing children.
[00:08:38.974 --> 00:08:41.815]  That's Fox News, but hey, just keep taking the injections, you know.
[00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:51.298]  Wired News, the Wired Russian Mind says control research behind Department of Homeland Security contract and mine control.
[00:08:51.698 --> 00:08:56.580]  It says in a dungeon-like psychological research institute in Moscow.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.561]  I mean, it's hardcore, folks.
[00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:03.702]  And we've got autistic teen tasered.
[00:09:05.003 --> 00:09:07.984]  They love going after folks that can't really respond.
[00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:13.145]  It just goes on and on and on and on and on and on here.
[00:09:13.225 --> 00:09:19.147]  German government publication promotes pedophilia as health, as healthy and sex ed.
[00:09:19.207 --> 00:09:20.408]  That sounds like the U.S.
[00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.171]  Unbelievable here, ladies and gentlemen, the news that I've got in front of me.
[00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.605]  Congress investigating and corruption of the State Department.
[00:09:34.066 --> 00:09:35.746]  That's just some of what's in that stack.
[00:09:36.146 --> 00:09:41.167]  And then I've got the financial news and so much more.
[00:09:41.187 --> 00:09:47.308]  I do want to go over a lot of the great questions too that have been posed to me on the PrisonPlanet.com forum.
[00:09:52.669 --> 00:09:55.369]  But right now, let's just go ahead and get into checkpoints.
[00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.370]  I couldn't believe it in 1999.
[00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:12.981]  When I saw the Tucson Star first, it said the police would randomly put people over at checkpoints and then they would say that we're going to take blood from you on the side of the road.
[00:10:13.001 --> 00:10:18.466]  And it got in the news because somebody refused and they beat him up.
[00:10:18.526 --> 00:10:22.749]  Now mind you, this isn't they're taking to jail and they're demanding blood.
[00:10:23.770 --> 00:10:25.932]  This is blood on the side of the street.
[00:10:28.766 --> 00:10:31.848]  And the cops were in the article going, hey, it's just blood out of your finger.
[00:10:32.408 --> 00:10:33.809]  It's just a small little needle.
[00:10:33.849 --> 00:10:35.530]  It isn't into a vein or artery.
[00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.092]  Can you imagine pulling up and there's cops with needles?
[00:10:40.133 --> 00:10:41.714]  In this one case, it was in the dark.
[00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:46.356]  They had flashlights, and they just beat the daylights out of him, charged him with resisting, and that was the end of it.
[00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:49.538]  And people couldn't believe it.
[00:10:50.038 --> 00:10:56.322]  Then, I started talking to Mike Hanson and others, when he was driving in from Gonzales, where he lives, back to Austin, where he also has a home.
[00:10:58.383 --> 00:11:08.108]  And how, and I've talked to other people I know, how they just set up checkpoints down that major highway, and now it's happening all around Austin, and they have text out there, and the cops say, you will answer the questions.
[00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:15.192]  And then they block a couple of lanes of traffic, and then back it up for miles to do questionnaires, and they order you to answer it.
[00:11:15.853 --> 00:11:18.034]  People say, well there's no law, I've got a Fifth Amendment.
[00:11:18.074 --> 00:11:21.816]  You know, there's a few Americans, maybe out of a hundred, that know about the Fifth Amendment.
[00:11:21.836 --> 00:11:23.737]  You don't have to answer questions of some bureaucrat.
[00:11:23.977 --> 00:11:25.858]  This isn't Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.
[00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:28.551]  Or Chinese, Communist China?
[00:11:29.691 --> 00:11:30.792]  Communist Chinese system?
[00:11:32.753 --> 00:11:34.574]  But they don't care, they just order it.
[00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:40.356]  Now, before I get into this article, what do you think they do with the vaccines?
[00:11:42.277 --> 00:11:47.780]  Every year, in August, starting around August 1st, it is in every newspaper in the country.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:51.201]  I mean, I've randomly checked newspapers, it's everywhere.
[00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:54.703]  It's on every TV station, in every town, every city.
[00:11:56.164 --> 00:12:06.410]  Thousands and thousands of reports, almost every day, saying, report to Zilker Park if you're in Austin, report to this gymnasium, report to the D.C.
[00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:16.376]  Community Center, report to the... And they'll announce on the news, it's the law, you've got to get your shots or no school, and you're arrested if you don't.
[00:12:17.516 --> 00:12:20.158]  There is no law, you've got to take any vaccines?
[00:12:21.724 --> 00:12:26.027]  But they get up on TV and they announce, it is the law, you will be arrested.
[00:12:27.187 --> 00:12:35.072]  We've played 30, 40, I don't know, of different TV reports here on air where they say, it's the law, it's the law, it's the law.
[00:12:35.873 --> 00:12:43.437]  And I've actually called up Austin news stations and I've said, let me guess, is that package news that was sent down by ABC or CBS, NBC, whatever station I've called?
[00:12:43.798 --> 00:12:44.458]  I've called them all.
[00:12:44.918 --> 00:12:46.099]  And they'll go, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:46.559 --> 00:12:47.440]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.961]  Oh, you were talking to the news director at the time.
[00:12:49.687 --> 00:12:51.208]  And they'll say, yeah, Alex, how you doing?
[00:12:51.228 --> 00:12:51.809]  Like the show.
[00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:52.869]  And I go, oh, you like the show?
[00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.071]  What are you doing running those news packages?
[00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:56.812]  Well, you know, they're news packages.
[00:12:56.852 --> 00:12:59.955]  They come in with the video and the text, and we're downsizing.
[00:12:59.975 --> 00:13:03.337]  We just read off what they say, and I go, but you know there's no law to take shots.
[00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:06.079]  And they'll usually say, well, I'm just doing my job.
[00:13:06.099 --> 00:13:07.440]  I'm not going to debate that with you.
[00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.023]  Boy, they'll say, well, don't you think shots are good?
[00:13:11.063 --> 00:13:12.444]  Shouldn't we try to get people to take them?
[00:13:12.684 --> 00:13:16.387]  Yeah, let's lie to people, because it's for their best interest.
[00:13:20.348 --> 00:13:21.889]  You see, where is it going to end?
[00:13:21.989 --> 00:13:27.833]  I mean, if they get on the news and say, we're going to take your children, and at some hospitals, they do take them.
[00:13:27.913 --> 00:13:33.016]  There's no law, but the hospital just says, that's neglect, not giving a shot, and they take your children.
[00:13:35.737 --> 00:13:46.223]  Now, at wealthy hospitals and upper middle class hospitals, they don't, because around 40%, I've talked to the doctors here locally, people don't, wealthy people and upper middle class are educated and they don't.
[00:13:46.724 --> 00:13:48.765]  Janie McCarthy, the Hollywood star,
[00:13:50.063 --> 00:13:54.947]  She's got a book out right now about how her third child, you know, got autism from the shots.
[00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.951]  I mean, you're not going to cover this stuff up.
[00:14:03.853 --> 00:14:05.975]  You're not going to be able to cover it up forever.
[00:14:07.956 --> 00:14:09.898]  When we go from 1 in 25,000 people having it, to 1 in 75.
[00:14:09.938 --> 00:14:10.698]  Again, last year it was 1 in 168.
[00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:20.812]  And I make this point because it's such an important public service announcement.
[00:14:22.112 --> 00:14:25.274]  When you go see Ratatouille at the movie theater with your children.
[00:14:25.494 --> 00:14:27.175]  My children have been to, I think, two movies.
[00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:32.478]  They've been to, because I don't want to totally not let them have any experience, you know, of cinema.
[00:14:32.818 --> 00:14:36.099]  We don't let them watch television, except maybe once every two weeks or so now.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:46.885]  But usually it's some documentary about whales or monkeys or wolves, but... To make a long story short, I'm digressing, you go to Ratatouille, and I'm not kidding folks,
[00:14:47.603 --> 00:14:51.445]  There were probably 30 autistic children in there of a theater of about 250.
[00:14:51.605 --> 00:14:54.166]  I mean, they were everywhere.
[00:14:55.327 --> 00:14:56.367]  Lines of them.
[00:14:57.047 --> 00:14:58.788]  The whole front row in their wheelchairs.
[00:14:59.289 --> 00:15:02.410]  And then the lesser brain damage as you went back.
[00:15:02.850 --> 00:15:08.013]  And I sat there while my wife had the children in the bathroom after the showing and I was watching them come out.
[00:15:08.553 --> 00:15:12.095]  And yeah, it was more than one in 75.
[00:15:12.315 --> 00:15:15.036]  I mean, when there's half of us can't talk?
[00:15:15.894 --> 00:15:17.335]  Are we going to say there's a problem?
[00:15:17.355 --> 00:15:26.044]  20 years ago, there might be one autistic child in a big high school.
[00:15:26.064 --> 00:15:30.788]  Now they'll have 3, 4, 5 rooms full of them at medium-sized schools.
[00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:34.392]  They'll have 30, 40, 50 at a school of a thousand.
[00:15:37.274 --> 00:15:40.017]  Just since I was in high school, 16 years ago,
[00:15:43.456 --> 00:15:50.620]  You go to high school events, you go see some family member graduate, there's autistic children wall to wall.
[00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:53.242]  You know, you're out there, you see it.
[00:15:55.123 --> 00:15:59.646]  Now, there's no law you gotta take those marker-filled shots, but they'll tell you all day there is.
[00:15:59.866 --> 00:16:05.309]  There's no law you gotta answer questions at checkpoints, but they'll, you get uppity, they're gonna taser ya!
[00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.990]  And they're gonna charge ya!
[00:16:07.851 --> 00:16:11.453]  After you flop around on the side of the brush, a fire ant's biting your body.
[00:16:12.119 --> 00:16:14.220]  They're going to go ahead and put a resisting arrest on you.
[00:16:16.362 --> 00:16:17.122]  If you're lucky.
[00:16:19.984 --> 00:16:21.084]  And those cops, they don't care.
[00:16:21.124 --> 00:16:22.485]  They give their children the injections.
[00:16:22.745 --> 00:16:24.106]  They buy into the whole thing.
[00:16:25.727 --> 00:16:31.190]  Highway Checkpoint asks drivers for blood, saliva, travelers outraged by private research group's request.
[00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:32.171]  This is World Net Daily.
[00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.753]  Motorists in Colorado are expressing outrage over a weekend stunt.
[00:16:36.736 --> 00:16:38.076]  Notice how it's always a stunt.
[00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:42.997]  Every time there was a Delta Force drill taking over a city, it was always the first time that it happened.
[00:16:43.277 --> 00:16:44.118]  They always told the locals.
[00:16:44.138 --> 00:16:45.438]  It was always an accident.
[00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:46.758]  It was always a stunt.
[00:16:47.638 --> 00:16:49.839]  And if you've studied it, there have been thousands of such drills.
[00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:51.379]  Thousands that I know of.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.241]  Literally 30, 40, 50, sometimes 100 a month, and that's going back 10 years.
[00:17:00.881 --> 00:17:03.902]  Every town, medium size and up in the country.
[00:17:09.431 --> 00:17:11.654]  You know, what does that have to do with blood checkpoints?
[00:17:12.455 --> 00:17:15.580]  See, just once you learn the propaganda, you see it everywhere.
[00:17:16.682 --> 00:17:21.729]  And I'm not saying World Daily's involved in it, they're regurgitating what the authorities told them.
[00:17:22.902 --> 00:17:27.845]  See, they all have psychological handbooks on how to handle you, what to say, how to phrase it all.
[00:17:28.445 --> 00:17:40.011]  Motorists in Colorado are expressing outrage over a weekend stunt in Gilpin County, about an hour's drive west of Denver, where highway checkpoints were set up so a private organization could ask for samples of blood and saliva.
[00:17:40.572 --> 00:17:42.773]  I don't think they're authorized to do what they're doing.
[00:17:42.813 --> 00:17:48.776]  No, they stop you where you're going, they block you with the police, you are under arrest, you are detained.
[00:17:48.996 --> 00:17:50.557]  That's what state law says, in federal.
[00:17:51.707 --> 00:17:53.188]  When the lights go on, you're under arrest.
[00:17:53.228 --> 00:17:55.869]  Folks, they arrest you and then make you talk to a bureaucrat.
[00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.271]  I don't think they're authorized to do what they're doing.
[00:17:58.571 --> 00:18:01.793]  Well, if you knew your rights, Roberto Sequeira, you would.
[00:18:01.833 --> 00:18:05.315]  And he obviously does, to some extent, more than most Americans, because he understands that.
[00:18:05.535 --> 00:18:06.656]  He doesn't know exactly why, though.
[00:18:07.076 --> 00:18:10.158]  And I view it as a gross violation of law enforcement protocol
[00:18:12.073 --> 00:18:16.037]  They can change protocol any day, but the Bill of Rights they can't, Roberto.
[00:18:16.057 --> 00:18:17.458]  51 told reporters for the Denver Post.
[00:18:17.878 --> 00:18:26.346]  He said he and his wife were detained for about 15 minutes even after they protested they wanted to get home because of a sleepy child in their car.
[00:18:26.946 --> 00:18:27.887]  You're not leaving!
[00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:29.588]  You're under arrest!
[00:18:30.469 --> 00:18:36.154]  Just like those cops in Indiana beat up that city councilman and the news claimed the councilman started a fight.
[00:18:37.256 --> 00:18:40.119]  After the councilman got in a fight, cops took him down.
[00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:42.961]  When the fight was the cops attacking him from behind.
[00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:45.623]  See the mind control spin there?
[00:18:49.286 --> 00:18:52.209]  They don't even call this an arrest in the Denver Post or World Net Daily.
[00:18:52.229 --> 00:18:56.012]  They just say, oh well, they got stopped for 15 minutes, wouldn't let them go.
[00:18:57.994 --> 00:19:01.277]  Sheriff's officials, see how every word is propaganda.
[00:19:01.837 --> 00:19:03.959]  They're not officials, they're servants.
[00:19:04.767 --> 00:19:06.309]  They're public servants.
[00:19:06.629 --> 00:19:07.851]  But see, they've removed that term.
[00:19:08.532 --> 00:19:14.379]  Sheriff's officials were apologizing after they helped set up and run five separate checkpoints over the weekend.
[00:19:14.639 --> 00:19:17.303]  They said drivers for the Institute for Research and Evaluation
[00:19:18.587 --> 00:19:25.451]  That workers from the Institute for Research and Evaluation were overly persistent in their demands of innocent travelers.
[00:19:25.511 --> 00:19:26.631]  Of innocent travelers.
[00:19:26.871 --> 00:19:27.972]  There were cops there.
[00:19:28.012 --> 00:19:28.892]  It's the same thing.
[00:19:28.912 --> 00:19:30.833]  This has been going on for eight years, I know of.
[00:19:31.094 --> 00:19:32.474]  And the cops will say, what's wrong?
[00:19:32.494 --> 00:19:33.035]  Get the blood.
[00:19:33.295 --> 00:19:34.155]  Oh, you're hiding something.
[00:19:34.175 --> 00:19:34.735]  Let me search.
[00:19:35.316 --> 00:19:36.476]  And it goes on into all that.
[00:19:38.737 --> 00:19:40.198]  This is how they operate.
[00:19:41.119 --> 00:19:42.279]  This is what they do.
[00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:43.540]  This is who they are.
[00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:49.891]  Look, they're telling you it's the law to take shots and they'll take your kids when there's no law?
[00:19:50.511 --> 00:19:53.672]  Of course they're gonna be out there trying to literally suck your blood!
[00:20:01.443 --> 00:20:04.464]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:04.784 --> 00:20:09.707]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:09.947 --> 00:20:14.308]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.609 --> 00:20:23.512]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.732 --> 00:20:27.334]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.634 --> 00:20:32.659]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:39.647]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:40.177 --> 00:20:40.838]  What about you?
[00:20:41.478 --> 00:20:46.823]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:21:01.235 --> 00:21:02.136]  Ted Anders for Midas.
[00:21:02.176 --> 00:21:02.497]  September 19, 2007.
[00:21:02.617 --> 00:21:02.917]  Gold 72510.
[00:21:03.038 --> 00:21:05.581]  Old school coins can be purchased for $747.76, $368.75 for half, $184.38 for quarter.
[00:21:05.601 --> 00:21:06.001]  That's $747.76, $368.75, and $184.38.
[00:21:16.135 --> 00:21:21.939]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:21:21.999 --> 00:21:26.342]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing a yon revolution.
[00:21:26.642 --> 00:21:35.088]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:21:35.128 --> 00:21:37.710]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:41.852]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:21:42.053 --> 00:21:48.476]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:21:48.797 --> 00:21:52.319]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:55.521]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:21:55.621 --> 00:21:55.901]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.921 --> 00:21:56.101]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:02.443 --> 00:22:04.504]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.124 --> 00:22:14.047]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.487 --> 00:22:21.689]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.418 --> 00:22:27.923]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:45.377 --> 00:22:45.718]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:01.515 --> 00:23:03.356]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:03.496 --> 00:23:08.677]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:08.837 --> 00:23:10.177]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:10.457 --> 00:23:18.619]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:24.561]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.761 --> 00:23:26.523]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.603 --> 00:23:28.765]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:28.785 --> 00:23:33.129]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:33.309 --> 00:23:35.471]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:35.551 --> 00:23:41.797]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their heart healthy.
[00:23:45.128 --> 00:23:45.428]  We're good.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.260]  Welcome back.
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:33.324]  The bigger story here isn't just that they're out there at a checkpoint holding families for over 15 minutes demanding they give blood and breathalyzer samples.
[00:24:34.485 --> 00:24:39.667]  It's that they then try to spin it and say, well, our officers were out there, but we weren't really stopping people.
[00:24:39.847 --> 00:24:40.367]  Oh, come on.
[00:24:40.387 --> 00:24:42.287]  You beat people up when they don't do it.
[00:24:42.327 --> 00:24:43.588]  I mean, it's been in the news before.
[00:24:46.551 --> 00:24:54.655]  And it goes on here to describe it, uh, the group doing the testing said, uh, peer officials, they're officials, see, too.
[00:24:54.956 --> 00:24:57.597]  The people just from the survey group are officials now.
[00:24:58.057 --> 00:24:59.598]  They're always officials.
[00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:01.799]  You're a civilian.
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:05.301]  They all call themselves military now.
[00:25:06.402 --> 00:25:07.703]  And you're a civilian.
[00:25:09.103 --> 00:25:15.807]  They said such statistics are important to gauge the impact of laws and enforcement policy to see who's on drugs, what's happening.
[00:25:16.505 --> 00:25:21.709]  Their questions began over the summer and will continue at other locations around the nation through November, they said.
[00:25:23.651 --> 00:25:24.752]  And they say, what's the big deal?
[00:25:24.812 --> 00:25:31.337]  We've been doing this to thousands of people, said John Lacey of the Alcohol Policy and Safety Research Center.
[00:25:32.198 --> 00:25:35.360]  And it goes on, the families begged to leave and were told they weren't allowed to go.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:40.724]  And so they repeatedly asked if they could leave.
[00:25:40.744 --> 00:25:43.907]  The law enforcement official said he was not
[00:25:44.716 --> 00:25:47.678]  Interested in leaving, but was told he could not leave.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:55.043]  It's just going to get worse and worse and wait until it's foreigners that are all the cops.
[00:25:55.423 --> 00:25:59.365]  And the troops are already, a huge portion of them, a huge percentage is already foreigners.
[00:26:00.286 --> 00:26:01.967]  It's going to be biblical, man.
[00:26:02.587 --> 00:26:03.188]  Biblical.
[00:26:04.489 --> 00:26:06.550]  Oh man, you talk about being slaves.
[00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.911]  I mean, I laugh about it because
[00:26:09.895 --> 00:26:11.236]  It's all so over the top.
[00:26:11.276 --> 00:26:14.337]  By the way, I have four or five articles along these lines today.
[00:26:14.998 --> 00:26:16.138]  Don't have time to cover them all.
[00:26:16.178 --> 00:26:16.699]  I'm sorry.
[00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:18.099]  I'm just going to cover one.
[00:26:21.621 --> 00:26:26.944]  But you can type vaccine reaction, vaccine death into Google every day and read hundreds of mainstream articles if you'd like.
[00:26:26.984 --> 00:26:28.725]  But it never gets on the big nightly news.
[00:26:28.785 --> 00:26:32.807]  It's kind of back burner and maybe 5% of people actually read news on the web.
[00:26:32.827 --> 00:26:38.190]  I think, what'd they say, like 14% of Americans read one book a year or something?
[00:26:39.167 --> 00:26:40.427]  And the rest don't even read books.
[00:26:40.507 --> 00:26:41.748]  So, you know, doesn't exist.
[00:26:41.788 --> 00:26:42.648]  Just take the injections.
[00:26:43.668 --> 00:26:48.049]  Pneumonia vaccine spurs superbug infecting children.
[00:26:48.329 --> 00:26:51.210]  Kind of like the swine flu killed tens of thousands.
[00:26:51.910 --> 00:26:53.390]  That vaccine, but that was kept quiet.
[00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:54.451]  Nah, just enjoyed.
[00:26:55.731 --> 00:26:57.251]  Chicago Associated Press.
[00:26:57.752 --> 00:27:00.292]  A vaccine that has dramatically curbed pneumonia.
[00:27:00.332 --> 00:27:01.112]  See, it's good.
[00:27:01.852 --> 00:27:03.253]  And other serious illnesses.
[00:27:03.293 --> 00:27:07.854]  Really, I just happened to see a statistic a few months ago that pneumonia is at all-time levels in the U.S.
[00:27:08.999 --> 00:27:12.021]  And people are getting all sorts of strange pneumonia, it's almost killing them.
[00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:15.943]  One of the people that works in this office, dad almost died from a super pneumonia.
[00:27:16.323 --> 00:27:18.004]  And they're saying it's these drug related ones.
[00:27:19.605 --> 00:27:23.027]  No statistics, no facts, they just say pneumonia is down.
[00:27:25.308 --> 00:27:27.089]  No, actually it's increasing.
[00:27:28.872 --> 00:27:37.996]  A vaccine that has dramatically curbed pneumonia and other serious illnesses in children is also having an unfortunate effect, promoting new superbugs that cause ear infections.
[00:27:38.377 --> 00:27:40.317]  But don't worry, they have an injection for that.
[00:27:41.018 --> 00:27:47.061]  On Monday, doctors reported discovering the first such germ that is resistant to all drugs approved to treat children and ear infections.
[00:27:47.561 --> 00:27:53.104]  Nine toddlers in Rochester, New York have had the bug, and researchers say it may be turning up elsewhere, too.
[00:27:53.124 --> 00:27:53.984]  I'll give you a break.
[00:27:54.688 --> 00:28:11.895]  It is a strain of strep bacteria not included in the pneumonicological vaccine and it's Reese Prevnar which came on the market in 2000 and is recommended for children under age two.
[00:28:11.995 --> 00:28:15.376]  Doctors say parents should continue to have their toddlers get the shots.
[00:28:15.676 --> 00:28:16.776]  Doesn't tell you what doctors.
[00:28:16.816 --> 00:28:18.977]  It just says doctors, you know, from the drug companies.
[00:28:19.417 --> 00:28:22.339]  And the vaccine prevents serious illnesses and even saves lives.
[00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:23.099]  But the new
[00:28:24.534 --> 00:28:37.904]  Resistant strep is a worry, and it goes on to say that, yeah, the vaccine caused it, but that's okay, and it says antibiotics caused the problem to begin with, but hey, you know, who doesn't like flesh-eating bacteria?
[00:28:41.487 --> 00:28:44.229]  That's nothing, though, to the live virus vaccines.
[00:28:44.249 --> 00:28:48.913]  I mean, I was just walking through the radio station Sunday, and there was the statesman with the woman that took it and killed her.
[00:28:50.146 --> 00:28:54.707]  It was an Ebola-like death of days of tortured pain as it ate her body.
[00:28:54.727 --> 00:28:58.169]  Autoimmune response.
[00:28:59.409 --> 00:29:01.990]  She took an experimental live virus.
[00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:08.812]  They say the next wave, they say all the vaccines are going to be special live virus shots.
[00:29:09.372 --> 00:29:13.173]  Like the HPV, but they got ads with happy girls jumping around.
[00:29:13.693 --> 00:29:15.374]  It must be good.
[00:29:18.854 --> 00:29:20.634]  I mean, the government wouldn't lie or hurt you.
[00:29:22.815 --> 00:29:24.975]  The government cares about you.
[00:29:25.956 --> 00:29:30.557]  That's why they're hiring Russian mind control experts to help run Homeland Security.
[00:29:31.777 --> 00:29:36.438]  That's why they hired the former head of the Stasi, the East German secret police, to help set it up.
[00:29:37.138 --> 00:29:39.419]  Or Primakov, the former head of the KGB.
[00:29:39.459 --> 00:29:44.880]  Because our government is run by really good people.
[00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:48.361]  The same folks that ran the Russian Revolution.
[00:29:51.974 --> 00:29:54.962]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.905 --> 00:29:58.592]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:50.846 --> 00:30:51.166]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[00:31:01.752 --> 00:31:02.312]  Hey, Emily!
[00:31:02.592 --> 00:31:03.452]  Wow, you look great!
[00:31:03.672 --> 00:31:04.492]  I feel great!
[00:31:04.712 --> 00:31:06.513]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:31:06.793 --> 00:31:07.093]  Really?
[00:31:07.313 --> 00:31:07.733]  What is it?
[00:31:07.953 --> 00:31:08.413]  How does it work?
[00:31:08.613 --> 00:31:15.194]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:31:15.354 --> 00:31:17.635]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:31:17.835 --> 00:31:23.156]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:31:23.496 --> 00:31:23.976]  That's it?
[00:31:24.256 --> 00:31:25.777]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:31:26.037 --> 00:31:26.757]  It is easy.
[00:31:26.957 --> 00:31:33.660]  Plus the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.460]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:36.481]  That's amazing!
[00:31:36.881 --> 00:31:42.243]  And the benzenite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:31:42.543 --> 00:31:42.883]  Well, how?
[00:31:43.104 --> 00:31:44.205]  Where can I buy a MediCleanse?
[00:31:44.485 --> 00:31:47.307]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.

[00:31:54.974 --> 00:31:55.174]  That's 1-800-317-9547.
[00:31:55.194 --> 00:31:55.495]  Call today.
[00:32:03.095 --> 00:32:03.576]  We're good to go.
[00:32:18.075 --> 00:32:18.935]  We're good to go!
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:43.600]  I think so.
[00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:22.398]  By the way, there are more than 100,000 Amish in Illinois and Ohio alone.
[00:33:23.219 --> 00:33:28.783]  And a few years ago, I had a well-known medical doctor on to go over those public statistics from Chicago.
[00:33:30.765 --> 00:33:32.226]  Was it Dr. Feisenstein?
[00:33:33.146 --> 00:33:37.490]  And did you know there's not one case in those two Amish communities
[00:33:40.336 --> 00:33:44.797]  Of Illinois and Ohio, not one case of autism.
[00:33:46.238 --> 00:33:50.599]  And you know, they have a longer lifespan than the people that live in the cities.
[00:33:51.339 --> 00:33:53.120]  And they have no major medical treatment.
[00:33:55.321 --> 00:33:57.701]  No futuristic, modern treatment.
[00:33:59.822 --> 00:34:05.904]  Doesn't matter though, the CPS nationwide, doesn't matter if it's from Kansas to Connecticut,
[00:34:06.548 --> 00:34:10.151]  They are going after all the Mennonite and Amish communities big time everywhere.
[00:34:10.672 --> 00:34:17.919]  And that's forced the Amish and the Mennonites now to start going on YouTube, start defending themselves, start buying video cameras.
[00:34:18.259 --> 00:34:25.105]  And I agree, they should detest the video cameras, they should detest computers, they are all very dangerous and have been used for great evil.
[00:34:25.946 --> 00:34:27.988]  But you're going to have to use them or you're going to be destroyed.
[00:34:28.008 --> 00:34:31.191]  You're going to have to fight fire with fire or it's over for you.
[00:34:32.012 --> 00:34:32.252]  Okay?
[00:34:32.867 --> 00:34:33.427]  It's real simple.
[00:34:33.868 --> 00:34:35.729]  You've got to keep them sequestered and isolated.
[00:34:35.749 --> 00:34:39.771]  I mean, I envy your lifestyle, quite frankly.
[00:34:40.432 --> 00:34:43.714]  But you have to use this stuff to fight the New World Order.
[00:34:45.115 --> 00:34:56.962]  By the way, I love technology, but I understand how it destroys community, how it destroys family, and how it is designed by its architecture, the way it was used to do bad things.
[00:34:58.083 --> 00:34:59.644]  And to see them under attack,
[00:35:00.757 --> 00:35:03.538]  Because they don't want their children to be taught pedophilia in the schools.
[00:35:05.978 --> 00:35:11.820]  As it is taught, I have news articles today, because they don't want their children to be taught how to smoke marijuana and snort cocaine.
[00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.980]  That's what the schools are.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.861]  They really teach you how to do that and put you in prison when you're dumb enough to use it.
[00:35:18.121 --> 00:35:23.962]  They teach you how to feel inadequate and need to wear, you know, all of the fancy clothes and dress like whores when they're ten.
[00:35:24.963 --> 00:35:25.623]  And they don't want
[00:35:26.795 --> 00:35:32.018]  Their children end up going to prison or end up brain damaged and the New World Order's got another plan for them.
[00:35:33.219 --> 00:35:36.001]  So that's something we should do some shows on is how they're attacking the Amish.
[00:35:36.321 --> 00:35:37.121]  I've got a clip.
[00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:47.748]  One of the first times the Amish are actually going on television to defend themselves because of the attacks that they're under in Jefferson County.
[00:35:48.428 --> 00:35:51.530]  This is out of WTOV 9 television.
[00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:56.433]  And then we've also got the Amish uploading stuff to YouTube now.
[00:35:58.456 --> 00:36:25.685]  I think what the Amish ought to do, if they want to keep technology out of their communities, is they should barter, as they've always done with the outside, with a liaison local patriot, but someone they've known their whole lives, someone who lives on the edge of the boundaries of the Amish lands, and then use that Ron Paul type, and they're everywhere, especially in these rural areas, as a liaison to be their reporter, to be their go-between,
[00:36:27.532 --> 00:36:28.753]  And that's what happened here.
[00:36:28.813 --> 00:36:31.374]  They called in somebody they knew to do it and go upload it.
[00:36:32.494 --> 00:36:33.094]  And that's good.
[00:36:33.194 --> 00:36:34.955]  So I would tell... I know the Amish listen.
[00:36:34.975 --> 00:36:38.096]  I know you're not really supposed to have radios and be listening, but I know a lot of you do listen.
[00:36:38.116 --> 00:36:38.636]  That's good.
[00:36:39.757 --> 00:36:43.438]  And the Mennonites are a little more free with the technology, a little more reasonable it seems like.
[00:36:43.958 --> 00:36:44.719]  I know they listen.
[00:36:44.779 --> 00:36:47.420]  And you just better start doing that or it's over for you.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:48.980]  It's over for everybody, period.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.262]  I mean, they got checkpoints now sucking blood out of families, but... I mean, we're just entering the gates of hell here.
[00:36:55.583 --> 00:36:56.103]  And, uh...
[00:36:59.719 --> 00:37:03.361]  I tell the Amish, too, don't go to FEMA camps and don't go along.
[00:37:03.461 --> 00:37:04.421]  I would be getting guns.
[00:37:05.542 --> 00:37:12.826]  Just to defend yourselves, because they really see you with all that prime property you've got and it's put in the news, they're trying to take your land all over the country.
[00:37:16.708 --> 00:37:18.449]  I'm already digressing off into the Amish.
[00:37:18.529 --> 00:37:26.993]  I'm so sick of watching the New World Order have their way with people over and over and over and over again.
[00:37:29.446 --> 00:37:29.886]  Oh boy.
[00:37:32.727 --> 00:37:35.847]  So we'll go over that coming up here.
[00:37:35.867 --> 00:37:39.328]  I want to tell you about a sponsor, then I'm going to get into the financial news.
[00:37:40.828 --> 00:37:42.909]  Then I've got a lot of other police state news like this one.
[00:37:44.249 --> 00:37:50.570]  Millions of CCTV cameras in England, yet 80% of crime unsolved.
[00:37:51.031 --> 00:37:57.792]  Less crime is solved now in England than before they put in 4 million cameras in London and over 10 million nationwide.
[00:37:59.105 --> 00:38:06.587]  But if you push an intruder, if you even push them while they're raping your wife, you go to prison and then they sue you and get your house.
[00:38:06.847 --> 00:38:09.367]  The government comes after you if you resist in any way.
[00:38:09.848 --> 00:38:20.150]  The Britoners, the British, are being trained to completely and totally be submissive, groveling worms.
[00:38:24.758 --> 00:38:31.841]  In fact, George Harrison chanted Hare Krishna while they were beating up and trying to rape his wife a few years ago before he died.
[00:38:31.881 --> 00:38:33.022]  He was dying of cancer at the time.
[00:38:33.262 --> 00:38:38.304]  He finally broke a lamp, if you go read the press reports, over the guy, and then he got in trouble.
[00:38:38.664 --> 00:38:38.784]  Oh!
[00:38:39.284 --> 00:38:42.986]  When someone's stabbing your wife, you don't fight back!
[00:38:44.207 --> 00:38:46.287]  Let me just tell you something, you scumbag government.
[00:38:46.668 --> 00:38:48.869]  I'll defend myself whenever I feel like it.
[00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:49.749]  You understand that.
[00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:57.906]  So I'll get into that for you as well.
[00:38:57.926 --> 00:39:02.368]  I want to tell you about the Liberty Dollar.
[00:39:02.388 --> 00:39:11.411]  These beautiful gold, silver, and copper rounds are double stamped, you know, with the image there on the coin.
[00:39:12.251 --> 00:39:14.092]  And they're just absolutely gorgeous.
[00:39:14.792 --> 00:39:16.813]  Absolutely gorgeous collector items.
[00:39:17.373 --> 00:39:19.233]  The silver is very reasonably priced.
[00:39:19.294 --> 00:39:20.054]  So is the gold.
[00:39:20.134 --> 00:39:23.535]  So is the copper.
[00:39:25.441 --> 00:39:26.442]  They're beautiful coins.
[00:39:26.542 --> 00:39:27.362]  I got a gold one.
[00:39:28.162 --> 00:39:30.344]  RonPaulDollar.net.
[00:39:30.384 --> 00:39:34.666]  RonPaulDollar.net or 888-LIB-DOLLAR.
[00:39:35.086 --> 00:39:35.906]  That's Liberty Dollar.
[00:39:35.926 --> 00:39:39.968]  888-LIB-DOLLAR or 888-421-6181.
[00:39:39.988 --> 00:39:45.631]  And folks, this company's been around a long time.
[00:39:45.651 --> 00:39:46.712]  You know about the Liberty Dollars.
[00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:51.663]  And it is a private voluntary barter currency.
[00:39:51.683 --> 00:39:54.304]  The Federal Reserve creates inflation when it issues U.S.
[00:39:54.324 --> 00:39:55.745]  dollars backed by government debt.
[00:39:56.145 --> 00:39:59.427]  Since 1913 when the Federal Reserve was created by Congress, their money has lost 96%.
[00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:01.888]  That number is four years old.
[00:40:02.268 --> 00:40:06.070]  It's lost 99% of its purchasing power due to inflation.
[00:40:06.411 --> 00:40:10.153]  The more money the Federal Reserve creates, the less your Federal Reserve money will buy.
[00:40:12.314 --> 00:40:13.895]  And this is the time to get in on
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:20.767]  Ron Paul, Liberty Dollars, 888-LIB-DOLLAR or RonPaulDollar.net.
[00:40:20.787 --> 00:40:25.332]  There is a banner on the right hand side of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:40:26.133 --> 00:40:28.236]  And another great sponsor.
[00:40:29.645 --> 00:40:32.629]  On top of that is the great folks at InnerFood.
[00:40:32.789 --> 00:40:38.016]  And I ate my InnerFood yesterday, I ate it today, and when I forget to take it, I really feel it.
[00:40:38.476 --> 00:40:39.578]  It isn't some placebo.
[00:40:39.618 --> 00:40:43.923]  I mean, it's got 20 high-quality, super-nutritive ingredients.
[00:40:44.003 --> 00:40:48.469]  It's not what you'd call a vitamin drink, because it's in the raw plant form, unheated.
[00:40:49.808 --> 00:40:55.050]  And even the vegetables and things we eat, even though organic, a lot of the soils have been debased.
[00:40:55.471 --> 00:40:57.892]  This is the vitamin drink to have, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:58.372 --> 00:41:05.215]  Balanced energy all day long, greater stamina, weight loss, 20 power packed ingredients, greater mental clarity, reduced food cravings, healthy radiant skin.
[00:41:05.775 --> 00:41:06.356]  And much more!
[00:41:06.376 --> 00:41:12.201]  www.innerfood.com or 866-762-9238 or www.innerfood.com and 10% off when you tell them Alex Jones sent you and 20% on top of that when you buy in bulk.
[00:41:12.221 --> 00:41:16.524]  The banner of course is on the right hand side again of www.prisonplanet.com
[00:41:29.466 --> 00:41:34.148]  All right, let me get into the news, the financial news right now.
[00:41:34.168 --> 00:41:38.809]  The next hour I'll get into all the other police state and war news and Ocmet Energy news.
[00:41:39.929 --> 00:41:43.370]  But right now, let me just get into the financial stack.
[00:41:45.751 --> 00:41:52.774]  Now, the globalist controllers, the social architects, know that the average American thinks on a day-to-day basis.
[00:41:55.935 --> 00:41:57.215]  So, the central bank
[00:41:58.291 --> 00:42:20.225]  Bernanke, head here in the U.S., the head of the Bank of England, the head of the Exchequer in England, the head of the German Central Bank, the head of the French and the Swiss Central Banks, they all came out last Friday through yesterday, and they're still doing it today, saying the dollar is over, the dollar won't be the world reserve currency anymore, it looks like it'll be the Euro, the stock market's going to have big trouble next year.
[00:42:20.245 --> 00:42:24.908]  I know I've already covered this, but I'm recapping before I get into the new news.
[00:42:28.186 --> 00:42:31.129]  Housing prices are going to go down by 10 to 30 percent.
[00:42:31.689 --> 00:42:33.611]  The economy is not growing fast.
[00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:37.294]  Inflation could be hyperinflationary.
[00:42:37.354 --> 00:42:38.375]  It's going to get worse.
[00:42:39.335 --> 00:42:43.179]  I mean, 10 years ago, Greenspan said one of those things, the economy would have tanked.
[00:42:44.099 --> 00:42:47.922]  Now they are all piling on, putting out the worst news they can.
[00:42:47.943 --> 00:42:54.348]  They know exactly what they're doing, while simultaneously they know that will make all the investors start dumping in major
[00:42:55.094 --> 00:42:57.437]  Credit problems and major flight from the dollar.
[00:42:58.018 --> 00:43:07.309]  But then, there's that layer in the financial publications, and then on CNN and Fox, Greenspan says we're going to do fine for the general public.
[00:43:07.329 --> 00:43:09.051]  See the different levels of propaganda.
[00:43:09.712 --> 00:43:12.696]  For the somewhat educated, they just come right out and say, kill the economy.
[00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:24.862]  But for the general public, Fox News Limbaugh, Greenspan's great, he loves us, he cares about us, he said cut the interest rates and Bernanke did it, but it's only a short time fix, it's going to get tough later.
[00:43:24.882 --> 00:43:29.789]  They're trying to save us, but it's our fault as Americans that we're lazy that this is going to happen.
[00:43:30.209 --> 00:43:55.580]  So see, they're pre-positioning themselves as the saviors, as the economy continues to tank, while they openly make the dollar plunge to new levels, trying to push it down under the waves, but it's been so buoyant that it keeps coming to the surface, but now it looks like it's gone under a mark that it's just going to keep falling now.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.781]  It's not pretty.
[00:44:00.652 --> 00:44:20.509]  And quite simply, this is done because you have the A-level banks, the real banks that control the governments, that issue the currency and issue the credit, and they opened up the floodgates more than ten years ago, unlimited lending, wild-eyed lending, and then in the last two years, they started saying, oh, what horrible policies of the U.S.
[00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:24.152]  and British and French governments, when the governments don't run that policy.
[00:44:26.514 --> 00:44:28.236]  The Federal Reserve, the central banks do.
[00:44:29.447 --> 00:44:44.978]  And then they start shutting down basically the brokerage houses, the different groups that are out there, getting the credit from the very central banks that issue it, and then going out and getting the general public into debt.
[00:44:45.398 --> 00:44:47.980]  And all they're doing now is blowing out their competition.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:55.685]  All the central banks are doing right now is artificially restricting credit, artificially cutting off the spigot,
[00:44:57.193 --> 00:45:00.856]  Popping the real estate bubble, which has been a cash sink.
[00:45:01.637 --> 00:45:10.164]  That was keeping the dollar somewhat afloat, because even though the dollar had been massively devalued, we hadn't seen the major inflationary trends.
[00:45:10.204 --> 00:45:23.235]  It was still massive, but nothing like the ultra-massive stuff we're seeing now, because you were able to still put it into overvalued real estate, but see, that wasn't completely fiat like the Federal Reserve note, or like stocks.
[00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:38.614]  And so they're trying to get you out of real assets and they've done a pretty good job of that because now when they pop the real estate bubble, which is now imploding, then they're going to try to artificially destroy that value and then pick it up for pennies on the dollar.
[00:45:41.335 --> 00:45:42.776]  But that's only a small part of it.
[00:45:42.796 --> 00:45:45.477]  The federal government has massively increased the debt ceiling.
[00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:51.076]  Meaning they're going to issue more treasury bonds and treasury notes and different types of U.S.
[00:45:51.096 --> 00:46:05.010]  government securities, meaning that they're going to raise the debt ceiling and let the big central bankers issue even more debt, which then we have to pay interest on the national debt for.
[00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:06.411]  It's a really sick system.
[00:46:06.591 --> 00:46:09.274]  The bankers credit out of nothing, they now get to
[00:46:10.934 --> 00:46:27.559]  Again, there's so many angles to this, but bottom line, two months ago they stopped letting the brokerage houses, they stopped letting the big companies that bundled up and sold the millions of housing loans in the Ponzi scheme, they're not buying those loans.
[00:46:31.525 --> 00:46:35.186]  And so that creates the credit crunch because the money isn't flowing through.
[00:46:35.426 --> 00:46:48.710]  Then the very central banks that did that stand around acting like they're bailing the economy out when they've already stolen trillions of dollars, then they pump in four hundred and something billion back into
[00:46:51.793 --> 00:47:01.561]  Some of these smaller banks, which actually have to pay those back as loans later, and those very loans, that very money, is backed up by the taxpayers.
[00:47:02.302 --> 00:47:14.052]  So basically, it's just a total fiat scheme with paper that these handful of families get to issue to everybody, and then they orchestrate the implosion of the economy, pose as the saviors, and consolidate all the wealth.
[00:47:17.381 --> 00:47:23.666]  And the Financial Times of London put that pretty simply yesterday, but I was trying to get into more of the facets and more of the details of it.
[00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:39.418]  But when you're standing around with a know-it-all liberal or conservative, you know, yuppie type, and they're going, just three gods of Greenspan coming in when he dead, I don't like that Bernanke.
[00:47:40.518 --> 00:47:46.603]  They're all locked up together, just slap that yuppie verbally upside the head and go, you idiot!
[00:47:47.788 --> 00:47:59.696]  Who do you think gets real assets and gets to gobble up all these mortgage brokerage firms and gets to gobble up all these hedge funds with hundreds of billions apiece of loans in them?
[00:48:01.497 --> 00:48:16.427]  They literally, the big central banks are just creating a credit crisis so they get to gobble it all up and then it gets backed up by the government which is backed up by us and then the bankers sell it as if it's something you demanded a lower interest rate
[00:48:20.271 --> 00:48:26.576]  So that it spurs more lending, which then only drives the dollar down even further.
[00:48:27.016 --> 00:48:35.282]  And at the end of the day, this diabolical plan is carried out, and the general public is thinking, out on Greenspan, and talking about how wonderful he is.
[00:48:42.088 --> 00:48:46.051]  Meanwhile, they're traitorous, un-American, hateful thing.
[00:48:46.071 --> 00:48:47.792]  I mean, it's one thing if they're going to have a fiat system.
[00:48:48.664 --> 00:48:49.705]  And they were good guys.
[00:48:49.785 --> 00:48:50.565]  It'd be dangerous.
[00:48:50.645 --> 00:48:51.466]  It'd be volatile.
[00:48:51.546 --> 00:48:52.267]  It'd be corrupt.
[00:48:52.307 --> 00:48:53.868]  It would destroy our value.
[00:48:53.888 --> 00:48:56.009]  It would destroy your savings.
[00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:58.431]  It's a horrible hidden tax.
[00:49:00.382 --> 00:49:10.369]  But it'd be one thing if they tried to keep it going and tried to ease it in and, and, and, and, uh, but no, they're up there screaming the dollar's gonna plunge, the economy's gonna fall apart.
[00:49:10.689 --> 00:49:16.813]  They're up there trying to kill the economy so they can consolidate, while out of the other side of their mouth saying they're saving it.
[00:49:16.833 --> 00:49:18.654]  I mean, that is so sick!
[00:49:18.975 --> 00:49:23.398]  It's just like they carry out 9-11, and we've got to sit there and watch them pose as saviors.
[00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:28.341]  It just gets too rich.
[00:49:29.432 --> 00:49:31.993]  Fears of dollar collapse as Saudis take fright.
[00:49:32.874 --> 00:49:36.815]  Southern Telegraph, Saudi Arabia has refused to cut interest rates and locked up with the U.S.
[00:49:36.855 --> 00:49:47.100]  Federal Reserve for the first time, signaling the oil-rich Gulf Kingdom is prepared to break the dollar currency peg in a move that risks setting off a stampede out of the dollar across the Middle East.
[00:49:47.140 --> 00:49:51.602]  Now, neocons put out this info that we've got to attack Iran because they've dumped the dollar.
[00:49:51.862 --> 00:49:52.822]  They did that years ago.
[00:49:52.942 --> 00:49:54.743]  Iran is nothing compared to Saudi Arabia.
[00:49:55.841 --> 00:50:02.447]  But again, they're going to blame all this, as they're doing, on the Iranians, when it's our good buddies, the Sauds, that are doing it.
[00:50:02.808 --> 00:50:06.351]  Why do you think Nick Cheney is moving to Saudi Arabia and getting another house in Dubai?
[00:50:06.631 --> 00:50:07.832]  They're all leaving, folks!
[00:50:08.473 --> 00:50:10.494]  I mean, almost every corporation is leaving now.
[00:50:11.095 --> 00:50:12.256]  You thought they were leaving before.
[00:50:12.296 --> 00:50:17.781]  They are in full stampede flight right now.
[00:50:20.652 --> 00:50:21.313]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:23.234]  They talk about how they love America.
[00:50:23.514 --> 00:50:24.835]  That's all that matters.
[00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:27.377]  As long as they just say that, the yuppies fall down.
[00:50:28.858 --> 00:50:29.558]  And worship them.
[00:50:29.758 --> 00:50:35.582]  This is a very dangerous situation for the dollar, said Hans Redeker, currency chief at BNP.
[00:50:38.504 --> 00:50:45.229]  Saudi Arabia has 800 billion, 400 billion pounds in their future generation fund.
[00:50:45.839 --> 00:50:46.960]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:50.941]  To all happening right now, Greenspan said dump the dollar on Sunday.
[00:50:51.442 --> 00:50:54.183]  The Saudis followed suit on Wednesday.
[00:50:54.903 --> 00:50:56.004]  We're getting hit hard.
[00:50:56.024 --> 00:50:57.124]  The U.S.
[00:50:57.184 --> 00:50:57.985]  is going down!
[00:51:04.366 --> 00:51:09.811]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.211 --> 00:51:17.838]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.536 --> 00:51:25.579]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:37.424]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.724 --> 00:51:41.225]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.685 --> 00:51:43.606]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.946 --> 00:51:47.788]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.061 --> 00:52:07.584]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.924 --> 00:52:12.007]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:12.307 --> 00:52:12.847]  We listened.
[00:52:13.147 --> 00:52:18.151]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:18.911]  We listened.
[00:52:19.271 --> 00:52:22.313]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.754 --> 00:52:23.294]  We listened.
[00:52:23.734 --> 00:52:27.777]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:28.217 --> 00:52:28.657]  We listened.
[00:52:29.018 --> 00:52:34.262]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.663 --> 00:52:36.004]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:36.384 --> 00:52:37.966]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:38.146 --> 00:52:43.711]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:52:44.171 --> 00:52:46.813]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[00:52:46.993 --> 00:52:47.193]  Only $279.

[00:52:49.854 --> 00:52:50.795]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.217 --> 00:53:03.679]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:06.020]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:53:06.161 --> 00:53:08.622]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:53:08.882 --> 00:53:13.245]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:53:13.285 --> 00:53:13.965]  Here's why.
[00:53:14.385 --> 00:53:20.309]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:53:20.549 --> 00:53:26.552]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:53:26.772 --> 00:53:27.693]  But they're not cheating.
[00:53:27.933 --> 00:53:31.936]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:53:32.116 --> 00:53:36.459]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:53:36.559 --> 00:53:44.064]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.

[00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:53.350]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:57.773 --> 00:54:02.637]  Alright, I've explained this one too much.
[00:54:20.216 --> 00:54:21.757]  Let me just break it down simply.
[00:54:22.117 --> 00:54:24.759]  The central banks took over the United States in 1913.
[00:54:24.799 --> 00:54:25.919]  They set up state police.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:27.620]  They federalized everything.
[00:54:28.481 --> 00:54:31.362]  They set up a globalist system to destroy any
[00:54:35.498 --> 00:54:42.462]  Independence of a nation by getting our infrastructure completely moved offshore, our jobs moved offshore, our high-tech jobs.
[00:54:42.502 --> 00:54:44.402]  They told us, oh, you'll have a service economy.
[00:54:44.683 --> 00:54:47.024]  Don't worry, you've still got the world reserve currency.
[00:54:47.444 --> 00:54:50.305]  Then we used our worthless dollars that got us more in debt.
[00:54:50.845 --> 00:54:52.706]  Because to create them creates debt, folks.
[00:54:52.926 --> 00:54:53.787]  It's a black hole.
[00:54:53.847 --> 00:54:54.787]  It's designed to do this.
[00:54:55.127 --> 00:54:59.970]  To buy Chinese slave goods that don't work half the time and are covered in poison paint.
[00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:02.791]  The very bankers that got us fully in their clutches
[00:55:03.914 --> 00:55:06.716]  Came out on the weekend and announced the dollar was going to die.
[00:55:07.837 --> 00:55:10.039]  And Venezuela dumped the dollar yesterday.
[00:55:10.440 --> 00:55:13.402]  Saudi Arabia is not pegging itself.
[00:55:14.643 --> 00:55:16.285]  It's oil reserved for the dollar.
[00:55:16.945 --> 00:55:18.086]  That's the only thing that backed it up.
[00:55:18.186 --> 00:55:21.850]  Folks, I mean, this is... It doesn't matter, folks.
[00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:25.733]  On Neocon Radio, they're just going to talk about Nuke and Iran all day.
[00:55:27.484 --> 00:55:30.407]  And they even say, well, it's about getting our dollar back up.
[00:55:30.427 --> 00:55:31.569]  They even tell them that lie.
[00:55:31.889 --> 00:55:33.330]  It's the Saudis doing this.
[00:55:33.651 --> 00:55:36.153]  It's Alan Greenspan that announced it was going to go down.
[00:55:36.434 --> 00:55:39.397]  It's them doing it, not the Iranians!
[00:55:40.638 --> 00:55:45.263]  The enemy is here, inside the country, running things out of New York and D.C.
[00:55:45.824 --> 00:55:47.906]  What does it take for you people to understand that?
[00:55:50.538 --> 00:55:51.339]  You don't care, though.
[00:55:51.379 --> 00:55:53.801]  You just want to stick George W. stickers on your car.
[00:55:53.821 --> 00:55:55.742]  You want to stick Hillary Clinton stickers on your car.
[00:55:56.242 --> 00:56:01.106]  You want to drive around and feel official and powerful and just believe the stuff you read in the newspaper and see on TV.
[00:56:01.887 --> 00:56:03.528]  If you'd wake up, we could turn it around.
[00:56:04.669 --> 00:56:06.450]  Let me give you the news flash again calmly.
[00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:17.379]  Alan Greenspan came out over the weekend on Sunday and said that the dollar would probably be replaced in the midterm
[00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:20.541]  By the Euro.
[00:56:21.042 --> 00:56:24.724]  It started a huge slide on top of the slide we've had in the last seven years.
[00:56:25.885 --> 00:56:28.006]  It accelerated its downward spiral.
[00:56:29.207 --> 00:56:29.947]  Exponentially.
[00:56:31.168 --> 00:56:37.212]  Then, today, the Saudis dumped the dollar, and it's pegging it to the petrodollar.
[00:56:38.352 --> 00:56:42.315]  The Venezuelans, the biggest oil producers in the Western Hemisphere, dumped.
[00:56:43.112 --> 00:56:47.497]  The elite have more oil than in Saudi Arabia and Alaska and they won't let it be pumped.
[00:56:47.557 --> 00:56:49.258]  It has nothing to do with the environmentalists.
[00:56:49.459 --> 00:56:52.622]  We have oil company documents on it, you idiots!
[00:56:53.142 --> 00:56:54.524]  I'm talking to neocons out there.
[00:56:56.428 --> 00:56:58.709]  We are completely being sold out and destroyed.
[00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:59.830]  The New World Order hated us!
[00:57:00.351 --> 00:57:04.473]  Just like the New World Order brought down Russia because they didn't like the Tsars because they were sovereign.
[00:57:04.753 --> 00:57:08.375]  We're being brought down, folks, and they're putting in a bunch of commissariats over us.
[00:57:08.956 --> 00:57:11.497]  Like Chertoff and the new Homeland Security Chief.
[00:57:11.918 --> 00:57:17.301]  I mean, these guys are scary, folks, and their families literally ran the Red Purges in Russia.
[00:57:17.341 --> 00:57:19.502]  You couldn't make this stuff up.
[00:57:19.562 --> 00:57:20.343]  The Red Terror.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:30.325]  You cannot make it up how much trouble this society and this country is in.
[00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:35.349]  It's simple!
[00:57:36.691 --> 00:57:42.096]  Our own government came out and the central banks that own this country came out and said, we're a bad investment.
[00:57:43.958 --> 00:57:47.281]  They'd already been trying to hint and push and get the economy to implode.
[00:57:47.922 --> 00:57:49.103]  They'd been doing everything they could.
[00:57:51.019 --> 00:58:01.045]  Basically, it's the equivalent of Greenspan shooting us five times in the chest if the country was a person, and then putting a Band-Aid on a bruised knuckle, or a bug bite.
[00:58:02.305 --> 00:58:12.031]  He comes in and shoots us five times in the heart, and blood's spraying out, and he smiles and says, but I take care of you, and sticks a Band-Aid on, and the media hails it.
[00:58:12.371 --> 00:58:14.792]  That's how absurd this is!
[00:58:15.693 --> 00:58:17.354]  Thanks a lot, New World Order.
[00:58:18.567 --> 00:58:20.888]  And the public can't even understand.
[00:58:21.208 --> 00:58:25.690]  The general public hearing this for the first time doesn't even know what I'm talking about.
[00:58:26.771 --> 00:58:26.891]  Ugh.
[00:58:27.851 --> 00:58:27.971]  Ugh.
[00:58:29.412 --> 00:58:29.532]  Ugh.
[00:58:29.872 --> 00:58:31.413]  Just see them do this to our country.
[00:58:33.073 --> 00:58:36.675]  All we had was that stupid dollar, folks, and they're taking that away from us.
[00:58:36.695 --> 00:58:38.556]  Do you know what this means?
[00:58:41.497 --> 00:58:45.799]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:58.416]  Hello fo- Big Brother.
[00:58:59.076 --> 00:59:00.136]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.836 --> 00:59:01.997]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.617 --> 00:59:03.437]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.177 --> 00:59:05.097]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.117 --> 00:59:09.478]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.919 --> 00:59:14.060]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:16.880]  We're gonna open them.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:18.321]  Phones up.
[00:59:19.121 --> 00:59:19.581]  This hour?
[00:59:20.954 --> 00:59:21.975]  John, will you close that mic?
[00:59:22.535 --> 00:59:25.237]  Alright, we're going to open the phones up this hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:25.257 --> 00:59:25.437]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:25.477 --> 00:59:27.759]  This is frankly... You know, I say this now every month or so.
[00:59:27.779 --> 00:59:31.161]  I used to every two or three years say, this is the most important broadcast I've ever done.
[00:59:51.104 --> 00:59:55.848]  And then now every month or so I say, this could be one of the most important broadcasts I've ever done.
[00:59:57.109 --> 01:00:01.072]  And now every week I'm saying, this could be one of the most important broadcasts I've ever done.
[01:00:01.192 --> 01:00:16.344]  And Stalin, Stalin's evil predecessor, Vladimir Lenin, to paraphrase, I don't think he was a good man, but a blind hog can find acorns, broken clocks are right twice a day as the cliche goes, but he was a smart guy.
[01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:23.955]  Vladimir Lenin said that there are times in history that when in a month, there are more changes than in the last hundred years.
[01:00:24.656 --> 01:00:31.740]  Well, we're in that period right now where the changes we're seeing, and everything's sped up more than it's ever been in history.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:42.266]  So instead of changes every 50, 60, 100 years, you know, there being massive periods of change, we're going into a period where it's just going to be continual upheaval, continual change.
[01:00:45.370 --> 01:01:01.898]  And even if we had angels running things and good, decent people, and the technology, the developments, the wildness of it all, there'd be a very good chance for cataclysmic disasters and emergencies and wars and bio-weapons getting out.
[01:01:02.378 --> 01:01:08.962]  But having psychopathic, sadistic, hardcore killers who love darkness and revel in just
[01:01:10.485 --> 01:01:11.626]  Absolute wickedness.
[01:01:12.306 --> 01:01:15.107]  That's who we've got running things with all these changes going on.
[01:01:15.147 --> 01:01:18.409]  So yes, it's going to be very, very interesting times.
[01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:37.499]  But I can say with a declarative assurity that the changes we are seeing right now in the world financial system are the biggest shifts since the end of World War II when the Anglo-American establishment
[01:01:38.300 --> 01:01:42.063]  Really teamed up for the first time and became the most dominant force on the planet.
[01:01:42.964 --> 01:01:44.946]  And then the Bretton Woods Agreement that came out of that.
[01:01:45.927 --> 01:01:50.811]  The dollar is being dumped as the world reserve currency right now.
[01:01:51.711 --> 01:02:02.621]  Alan Greenspan and every other major central banker in the world together in unison made public statements on television and in print over the weekend saying the dollar was dead.
[01:02:03.361 --> 01:02:06.264]  Venezuela, which is huge,
[01:02:08.237 --> 01:02:18.404]  And now Russia, and now China, and now Saudi Arabia, with $800 billion in one fund of U.S.
[01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:26.449]  dollars alone, is dumping the dollar and taking the dollar out of its world reserve currency position.
[01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:31.093]  They are letting us cut interest rates, but they're not cutting interest rates.
[01:02:32.293 --> 01:02:33.374]  Huge move!
[01:02:34.275 --> 01:02:34.635]  Huge!
[01:02:36.872 --> 01:02:39.794]  And you tune in to fake neocon, fake conservative radio.
[01:02:42.075 --> 01:02:45.076]  Roger Ailes Radio, funding Hillary Clinton, totally staged.
[01:02:45.797 --> 01:02:49.959]  You tune in there, all they're talking about is nuking Ahmedinejad, now it's all his fault.
[01:02:50.299 --> 01:03:02.345]  And they're going to take our economy, take our country away from us, but don't worry, you'll still cheerlead the government, because at least they'll be bombing somebody, and you can't find them on a map, but it feels good, because you don't like that Ahmedinejad-er.
[01:03:03.399 --> 01:03:05.761]  I don't like him.
[01:03:05.781 --> 01:03:08.263]  I don't like that Arab.
[01:03:08.283 --> 01:03:09.304]  He's not an Arab, twit.
[01:03:12.446 --> 01:03:19.271]  We're in a clash of civilizations, like the Greeks when they held them back in that movie 300.
[01:03:21.153 --> 01:03:25.877]  No, we're run by the New World Order that's destroying our country from within.
[01:03:27.501 --> 01:03:31.064]  Well they got you focused on a red cape they flapped in front of your face.
[01:03:31.424 --> 01:03:40.652]  And they got the sword right behind it like the matador and you go running right at the red cape and they got a little sword waiting to drive it right into your fat chest you idiot!
[01:03:42.934 --> 01:03:44.796]  Don't talk to me like that!
[01:03:45.556 --> 01:03:48.659]  I like... I like booze!
[01:03:54.537 --> 01:04:03.600]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:15.084]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:04:15.404 --> 01:04:20.546]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:21.147]  No problem.
[01:04:21.367 --> 01:04:28.015]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:28.235 --> 01:04:35.083]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:04:35.343 --> 01:04:37.105]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:04:37.366 --> 01:04:39.428]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements
[01:04:39.428 --> 01:04:40.610]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:41.210]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:43.573]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:04:59.602]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:04:59.942 --> 01:05:01.903]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:05:02.263 --> 01:05:09.927]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:17.670]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.051 --> 01:05:20.992]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[01:05:21.392 --> 01:05:23.713]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[01:05:24.134 --> 01:05:24.934]  NSA spying.
[01:05:25.433 --> 01:05:29.495]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.776 --> 01:05:33.258]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.758 --> 01:05:35.679]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:39.942]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.402 --> 01:05:54.463]  Hey, Jack Blood here.
[01:05:54.684 --> 01:06:00.670]  I think that if we could see the germs and potential biohazards all around us in our daily surroundings, we would turn into Howard Hughes.
[01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:05.195]  We try not to think about it primarily because we might think there's nothing we can do about it.
[01:06:05.496 --> 01:06:06.257]  Not so fast.
[01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:07.598]  Now there is a solution.
[01:06:07.798 --> 01:06:11.983]  I'm talking about Hazurid Complete Protection Kit, available now at Hazurid.com.
[01:06:13.044 --> 01:06:21.746]  This is the single solution that is tame enough to safely conquer everyday household and business cleaning chores, yet strong enough to decontaminate biological hazards.
[01:06:21.966 --> 01:06:26.467]  Hazurid fights infectious disease and unsurpassed odor, mold, and allergens.
[01:06:26.547 --> 01:06:31.088]  This is an amazing, state-of-the-art disinfectant with a no-questions-asked guarantee.
[01:06:31.248 --> 01:06:35.129]  Safe for kids and pets and indispensable for your home, car, or business.
[01:06:35.229 --> 01:06:37.229]  Wherever you go, take Hazurid with you.
[01:06:37.409 --> 01:06:41.170]  Call them now to order 800-675-0323.
[01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:43.850]  That's 800-675-0323.
[01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:47.891]  Or go to the web, www.hazard.com.
[01:06:48.131 --> 01:06:50.852]  H-A-Z-A-R-I-D, hazard.com.
[01:06:51.072 --> 01:06:52.112]  Tell them Jack Blood sent you.
[01:06:54.432 --> 01:06:56.613]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:57.193 --> 01:07:00.034]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.654 --> 01:07:04.815]  The biggest financial shift
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:22.498]  Since the end of World War II, and all the prosperity that came out of that, this is the opposite of what began, prosperity-wise, in 1946 in this country.
[01:07:25.823 --> 01:07:27.304]  We were the reserve currency.
[01:07:27.604 --> 01:07:28.505]  We could issue it.
[01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:30.226]  It was the money of the world.
[01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:32.388]  Didn't matter if we didn't have industry.
[01:07:32.428 --> 01:07:34.109]  Didn't matter if we didn't have factories.
[01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.451]  Didn't matter if we didn't have innovation anymore.
[01:07:36.531 --> 01:07:37.692]  We'd always had that before.
[01:07:38.893 --> 01:07:43.096]  We had the currency, and people would let you buy things with it.
[01:07:43.136 --> 01:07:48.080]  And the government could just issue it, but then they had to go into debt to the private banks that had taken us over.
[01:07:50.257 --> 01:07:56.119]  And now the very private bankers that used our muscle to build their New World Order have shut up their European Union.
[01:07:56.139 --> 01:08:02.540]  They want it to be the New World Reserve currency to then advertise how great the Euro is and tell the Europeans, see how great we are?
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.901]  They openly wrote books decades ago saying this.
[01:08:06.641 --> 01:08:08.002]  See how great globalism is?
[01:08:08.022 --> 01:08:12.363]  We, the Euro, followed globalism so it did well.
[01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:14.244]  America didn't.
[01:08:16.404 --> 01:08:19.265]  And they're like smooth haulings with tariff deals.
[01:08:20.743 --> 01:08:22.644]  They held back immigration deals.
[01:08:22.704 --> 01:08:24.205]  They wouldn't let the Mexican trucks in.
[01:08:24.525 --> 01:08:26.346]  So look what happened to them.
[01:08:27.827 --> 01:08:34.110]  So for those that just joined us, the Saudis, here's the headline, London Telegraph.
[01:08:34.130 --> 01:08:34.731]  This isn't me.
[01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:38.493]  Fears of dollar collapse as Saudis take fright.
[01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:42.135]  And it said that they are removing their 800 billion
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:47.562]  From pegging it to the dollar, it's no longer dollarized, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:48.062 --> 01:08:49.203]  That's a pretty big deal.
[01:08:49.523 --> 01:08:51.324]  Earth-shattering, I would say, in and of itself.
[01:08:51.704 --> 01:08:53.285]  The Russians are beginning to fully move away.
[01:08:53.345 --> 01:08:55.186]  The Chinese are accelerating their basket.
[01:08:55.586 --> 01:08:59.568]  They started a year ago of currencies and moving more and more of the dollar out of their basket.
[01:09:01.389 --> 01:09:06.872]  We, at the same time, I have the Venezuelans, dumped the dollar completely yesterday.
[01:09:07.652 --> 01:09:08.793]  Went off dollarization.
[01:09:10.231 --> 01:09:12.252]  You won't hear a word about it on talk radio, folks.
[01:09:12.312 --> 01:09:13.972]  All you're going to hear is the Iranians did it.
[01:09:15.292 --> 01:09:20.474]  Not Alan Greenspan, who announced with all the other central bankers this weekend that the dollar was going down.
[01:09:20.874 --> 01:09:21.954]  They did it!
[01:09:22.254 --> 01:09:23.414]  They are the culprits!
[01:09:26.175 --> 01:09:30.476]  They're the bosses, they gave the signal, and everybody's following suit, going, yes, a boss.
[01:09:33.001 --> 01:09:34.663]  Dollar hits new low against the Euro.
[01:09:34.683 --> 01:09:34.963]  The U.S.
[01:09:35.003 --> 01:09:41.628]  dollar hit a new low, record low, against the Euro as investors sold the currency after the Federal Reserve's hefty interest rate cuts.
[01:09:41.648 --> 01:09:41.708]  See?
[01:09:41.989 --> 01:09:46.873]  Not only did they say the dollar was going to go down, then they cut the rates and convinced you it was good for you!
[01:09:48.874 --> 01:09:57.942]  Because all you care about is that stock market giving the artificial illusion of going up when you're buying the stocks with a dollar worth half of what it was.
[01:09:59.341 --> 01:10:01.483]  I know I keep saying this, but yuppies don't understand.
[01:10:01.943 --> 01:10:03.384]  I try to talk to them, I go, listen!
[01:10:03.605 --> 01:10:04.946]  They devalued the dollar!
[01:10:04.966 --> 01:10:06.307]  The stock market's way down!
[01:10:06.547 --> 01:10:07.568]  And they just giggle.
[01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:11.011]  They have that dumb little look, a little twinkle in their eye.
[01:10:11.031 --> 01:10:13.713]  Hey, they're like, I'm a yuppie, man!
[01:10:14.193 --> 01:10:15.234]  I'm invincible!
[01:10:15.274 --> 01:10:17.656]  If I laugh at something, it makes it go away!
[01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:21.659]  The euro jumped to 1.4018.
[01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:21.920]  Oh.
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:21.980]  My.
[01:10:22.780 --> 01:10:22.940]  Gosh.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:23.001]  Oh.
[01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.036]  Oh, that's massive.
[01:10:30.237 --> 01:10:31.338]  Oh, it's only going to get worse.
[01:10:31.538 --> 01:10:32.359]  Oh my gosh.
[01:10:32.379 --> 01:10:36.224]  Can you imagine how Paul Watson's crying?
[01:10:36.865 --> 01:10:47.238]  I pay him and his brother in dollars and uh... It's pretty amazing.
[01:10:50.586 --> 01:10:53.068]  The Euro jumped to 140.18.
[01:10:53.168 --> 01:10:56.891]  Folks, the Euro opened in 2000 at 80 cents to the dollar.
[01:10:57.432 --> 01:10:59.934]  That is a 60.18 change.
[01:11:00.054 --> 01:11:00.895]  A 60.18.
[01:11:02.116 --> 01:11:07.821]  But if you do it like the media does and just look at it from the point where it hit parity with the dollar in 2003, that is a 40.18 shift.
[01:11:07.841 --> 01:11:08.581]  40 plus point shift!
[01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:09.742]  Super Mayday emergency!
[01:11:20.626 --> 01:11:22.366]  And again, you're not going to see it overnight.
[01:11:22.647 --> 01:11:23.687]  Sure, a car that was $15,000 is $40,000 now.
[01:11:23.707 --> 01:11:24.387]  A house that was $100,000 is $400,000 now.
[01:11:24.427 --> 01:11:25.707]  Milk that was $1 is $3 now.
[01:11:25.727 --> 01:11:26.227]  Gas that was $1.50 is $2.50 now.
[01:11:26.267 --> 01:11:28.448]  They're saying it's going to go up to $4 a gallon.
[01:11:28.468 --> 01:11:28.768]  $5 a gallon.
[01:11:28.788 --> 01:11:29.528]  Crude oil is at above $82.
[01:11:29.568 --> 01:11:31.769]  Gold is about to go over $7.30 an ounce today.
[01:11:51.022 --> 01:11:54.628]  And you wait till next year when it totally bottoms out, folks.
[01:11:54.908 --> 01:11:58.433]  Gold will be 2,000 an ounce when it's properly valued 3,000.
[01:12:00.396 --> 01:12:02.399]  But I don't care if gold went down.
[01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:06.626]  I'm not about to get rid of the little bit of gold I got for more toilet paper notes.
[01:12:13.453 --> 01:12:14.614]  Alright, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:12:14.754 --> 01:12:19.918]  I just, to see them do this to us, and then the news says they're the good guys.
[01:12:22.060 --> 01:12:27.604]  I want to smash things right now because this is like, let's say you've got $100,000 in the bank.
[01:12:27.624 --> 01:12:30.025]  Let's say you've worked 20 years, put $100,000 in there.
[01:12:32.087 --> 01:12:35.069]  You understand that in the last three years it's been devalued by 40%.
[01:12:37.731 --> 01:12:40.593]  And in the three years before that it was devalued by 20%.
[01:12:42.301 --> 01:12:45.663]  That's sixty percent, boy!
[01:12:50.065 --> 01:13:00.971]  And my boy, I'm talking to the yuppies and the establishment types, the Gordon Blawyers, he's coming on the show tomorrow, this neocon writer says I should be arrested for treason.
[01:13:02.051 --> 01:13:10.656]  They just don't care, they still just giggle and snicker and when it all implodes we'll have to hear from them how Green Stand's good, I mean that's the sickest part of it.
[01:13:11.651 --> 01:13:13.473]  I'm so sick of you being dumb!
[01:13:13.733 --> 01:13:18.776]  I'm so sick of you letting those that have done this to us get away with it and laugh at us!
[01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:25.722]  But if they don't just get away with it, they get to take the whole shoot and match over.
[01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:27.463]  We get to be bigger slaves.
[01:13:27.503 --> 01:13:29.544]  They've set up a police state in case we struggle.
[01:13:30.365 --> 01:13:32.026]  They're going to overrun us with more illegals.
[01:13:32.046 --> 01:13:33.747]  We're going to be a total third world country.
[01:13:35.669 --> 01:13:36.930]  And it's funny to you people.
[01:13:37.746 --> 01:13:38.886]  It's funny to you!
[01:13:38.906 --> 01:13:40.307]  It isn't funny to me!
[01:13:40.587 --> 01:13:41.327]  I live here!
[01:13:41.347 --> 01:13:44.928]  I don't know.
[01:13:44.988 --> 01:13:48.669]  I had family get here in the 16-somethings.
[01:13:48.769 --> 01:13:50.169]  I mean, how many generations is that?
[01:13:52.089 --> 01:13:53.010]  I love this country.
[01:13:54.310 --> 01:13:55.130]  I love Texas.
[01:13:56.350 --> 01:13:57.891]  And it's all just being destroyed.
[01:13:57.931 --> 01:13:59.211]  The roads and water.
[01:13:59.471 --> 01:14:02.752]  Everything being handed over to foreign criminal groups who didn't even pay for it.
[01:14:03.889 --> 01:14:18.802]  Wall-to-wall looting, brainwashing training in the schools, cops telling them homeschoolers are going to kill them, hardcore Soviet brainwashing, Wired Magazine reporting on it, I mean, actual Soviet brainwashing techniques, and the cops don't even know they've been trained to do it to kids.
[01:14:19.943 --> 01:14:31.873]  Taking blood at checkpoints in the news, it's frothing evil everywhere, FEMA cams built everywhere, actual sons and grandsons of famous commissars literally running the country!
[01:14:33.087 --> 01:14:34.827]  You couldn't make that up!
[01:14:37.508 --> 01:14:42.489]  And they're doing it to keep us safe from Al-Qaeda, known CIA-created!
[01:14:50.191 --> 01:14:53.551]  And we don't have the voice to reach everybody and tell them, I wish I could warn America.
[01:14:54.432 --> 01:14:56.832]  I wish I could explain to them in Italian-Greenspan.
[01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:58.572]  I wish I could explain to them what's happening.
[01:15:00.893 --> 01:15:01.453]  But I can't!
[01:15:05.755 --> 01:15:09.057]  And to find out the people running our government ran the Red Terror.
[01:15:10.838 --> 01:15:11.918]  Hell, Albright's daddy.
[01:15:12.318 --> 01:15:16.100]  It didn't just start now, but killed over one million in Czechoslovakia.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:16.700]  That's public.
[01:15:21.943 --> 01:15:22.483]  Chertoff.
[01:15:25.165 --> 01:15:27.826]  The new Attorney General is like hardcore
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.923]  Commissariat family, I mean, we are in trouble, folks.
[01:15:31.983 --> 01:15:34.645]  We're in deep, deep trouble.
[01:15:35.065 --> 01:15:36.766]  They're not playing around.
[01:15:36.827 --> 01:15:39.389]  These people don't play games.
[01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:47.255]  They went into Ukraine and killed 20 million people in five years, and they did it cold-bloodedly.
[01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.669]  But I guess you can't be told about the Matrix.
[01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:56.989]  You gotta taste it.
[01:15:57.489 --> 01:16:02.011]  You gotta see it, don't ya?
[01:16:02.711 --> 01:16:05.412]  God, our founders, though, I think gave us one thing, and that's the guns.
[01:16:05.852 --> 01:16:12.895]  Just the fact that they're still here, though they've almost killed the gun culture, is the only thing holding them back, and they'd love to have their way with every one of us.
[01:16:16.156 --> 01:16:18.337]  And they'd love to have their way with us right now.
[01:16:22.318 --> 01:16:29.024]  They're already having their way with it, so the injections and the prisons and the system, a soft tyranny, but it's going to get a lot harder.
[01:16:32.987 --> 01:16:37.471]  And I know a lot of cops aren't going to listen to me until later, when it's too late, when they see it all happen.
[01:16:38.612 --> 01:16:44.397]  They're going to laugh about the vaccines until their 18-month-old takes the third round and has the convulsion and is gone forever.
[01:16:45.758 --> 01:16:46.358]  Their mind.
[01:16:47.739 --> 01:16:50.602]  You've got to find out a year from now that your dollar was destroyed.
[01:16:53.078 --> 01:16:55.380]  You're not going to listen to me, but later you will.
[01:16:56.841 --> 01:16:57.682]  I trust in that.
[01:16:58.222 --> 01:16:59.223]  Later you will.
[01:16:59.603 --> 01:17:03.086]  Later you'll know just how deadly serious this is.
[01:17:06.469 --> 01:17:07.690]  I'm so angry right now.
[01:17:08.570 --> 01:17:09.111]  They're doing it.
[01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:10.252]  Everything that was foretold.
[01:17:10.652 --> 01:17:11.813]  Everything they planned to do.
[01:17:12.253 --> 01:17:14.335]  And my God, the next steps get so much worse.
[01:17:14.355 --> 01:17:15.796]  I don't even want to talk about it on air.
[01:17:18.030 --> 01:17:19.291]  The road they're leading us down.
[01:17:19.311 --> 01:17:20.011]  Let's go to calls.
[01:17:20.031 --> 01:17:21.012]  I said I'd go to calls.
[01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:24.815]  Uh, John in Texas, then Lucas, then Kim, Jason, Richard, and others.
[01:17:25.135 --> 01:17:25.776]  Go ahead, John.
[01:17:25.796 --> 01:17:26.956]  Uh, yeah.
[01:17:26.996 --> 01:17:27.537]  Hey, Alex.
[01:17:27.617 --> 01:17:28.457]  Uh, nice to talk to you.
[01:17:29.318 --> 01:17:38.064]  I was, uh, watching CBS News yesterday and, uh, something about Dan Rather, uh, he's, uh, suing... Yeah, suing Viacom about how they basically planted that story on him.
[01:17:38.885 --> 01:17:40.426]  And then they mentioned he works for Mark...
[01:17:41.122 --> 01:17:41.603]  Is that true?
[01:17:41.663 --> 01:17:42.243]  How does that work?
[01:17:42.523 --> 01:17:43.624]  I don't have the internet right now.
[01:17:43.884 --> 01:17:44.325]  I don't know.
[01:17:44.405 --> 01:17:48.188]  Rather lives here in Austin, in Dallas, and Cuban works right around here.
[01:17:48.728 --> 01:17:49.068]  I don't know.
[01:17:49.689 --> 01:17:52.191]  You think maybe Dan Rather's the next 9-11 truther?
[01:17:53.472 --> 01:18:00.017]  You know, I've met Dan Rather and I've met Robin Rather because she lives here in Austin, but we're different politically, so I don't know anything.
[01:18:00.097 --> 01:18:00.417]  I don't know.
[01:18:00.457 --> 01:18:02.759]  He's suing them because they planted the story on him.
[01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:04.180]  Oh, man.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:04.500]  All right.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:10.585]  Also, I wanted to say I totally agree that the clash of civilizations is a myth, like one of the great myths of our whole
[01:18:11.938 --> 01:18:13.139]  Well, I mean, let's be clear.
[01:18:13.239 --> 01:18:23.883]  I mean, the Muslims are an old-fashioned culture of men and women and children, and so it's going to dominate the modern hippie culture, which is designed to fall apart.
[01:18:24.443 --> 01:18:30.445]  But, in a way, there is the clash, but the globalists are exacerbating it, and the way they present it is a myth.
[01:18:30.485 --> 01:18:30.766]  Yes, sir?
[01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:31.806]  Oh, yeah.
[01:18:32.206 --> 01:18:33.246]  And autism is real.
[01:18:34.667 --> 01:18:35.367]  That's real?
[01:18:35.407 --> 01:18:36.728]  Yeah, my friend's nephew.
[01:18:36.788 --> 01:18:39.409]  Well, my friend's nephew, he got it right after the shot at 18 months.
[01:18:40.467 --> 01:18:41.749]  I've seen it in my own life, sir.
[01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:43.491]  Yeah, it's only going to get worse though.
[01:18:44.211 --> 01:18:45.012]  Alright, we'll come back.
[01:18:45.032 --> 01:18:45.613]  Thank you, John.
[01:18:45.653 --> 01:18:47.315]  Lucas and others, your calls are straight ahead.
[01:18:53.931 --> 01:18:59.173]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:59.313 --> 01:19:07.396]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:07.656 --> 01:19:14.698]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:14.898 --> 01:19:16.159]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:19:16.239 --> 01:19:22.144]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:27.428]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:19:27.528 --> 01:19:36.416]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:19:36.676 --> 01:19:39.978]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:42.401]  We're good.
[01:19:53.493 --> 01:19:59.716]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:20:00.176 --> 01:20:07.959]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.279 --> 01:20:16.163]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.463 --> 01:20:21.205]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.545 --> 01:20:26.251]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.771 --> 01:20:30.635]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:31.116 --> 01:20:32.137]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:32.217 --> 01:20:36.242]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[01:20:36.702 --> 01:20:41.085]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[01:20:41.605 --> 01:20:44.167]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[01:20:44.587 --> 01:20:46.268]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:46.368 --> 01:20:46.608]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.018 --> 01:20:57.282]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:20:57.542 --> 01:21:02.386]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:02.646 --> 01:21:03.967]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:21:04.147 --> 01:21:07.530]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:12.914]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:21:13.174 --> 01:21:18.939]  Marty Schachter founded Calbin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:21:19.259 --> 01:21:21.700]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:24.101]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.
[01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:26.442]  From bathing and laundry to dishes, hair and more.
[01:21:26.722 --> 01:21:27.702]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:21:27.922 --> 01:21:28.863]  No animal testing.
[01:21:29.123 --> 01:21:30.443]  I use them and love them.
[01:21:30.463 --> 01:21:32.064]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:21:32.344 --> 01:21:33.465]  And I save big time.
[01:21:33.745 --> 01:21:35.345]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:21:35.465 --> 01:21:35.805]  That's 1-800-340-7091.
[01:21:35.825 --> 01:21:38.346]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:21:45.209 --> 01:21:51.673]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:21:52.773 --> 01:21:54.735]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:21:54.995 --> 01:21:58.036]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:21:58.317 --> 01:22:03.099]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:22:03.399 --> 01:22:06.141]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:22:06.401 --> 01:22:11.064]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[01:22:11.344 --> 01:22:13.205]  Yet, they don't want you to know about them.
[01:22:13.726 --> 01:22:23.680]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[01:22:24.061 --> 01:22:28.708]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:22:29.128 --> 01:22:32.631]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:22:32.851 --> 01:22:35.012]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[01:22:35.312 --> 01:22:39.435]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll even refund the shipping charge.
[01:22:39.755 --> 01:22:42.858]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[01:22:43.098 --> 01:22:43.998]  What are you waiting for?
[01:22:44.158 --> 01:22:44.839]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[01:22:44.859 --> 01:22:45.259]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[01:22:45.299 --> 01:22:45.439]  Today!
[01:22:58.482 --> 01:23:00.383]  Waging War on Corruption.
[01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:03.684]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.686 --> 01:23:08.467]  Alright, I'm sorry I haven't gotten to more of your calls.
[01:23:08.487 --> 01:23:12.469]  There's just so much financial news, police state news, war news, it all ties together.
[01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:14.830]  It's coming up in the third hour.
[01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:15.970]  Right now we're taking calls.
[01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:18.651]  Lucas in Texas, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:23:18.671 --> 01:23:19.092]  Go ahead.
[01:23:19.592 --> 01:23:21.293]  Hey my friend, thanks for taking my call.
[01:23:22.674 --> 01:23:28.417]  About the David Schneider beating video in Indiana, they're trying to suppress that pretty hard.
[01:23:28.477 --> 01:23:33.819]  They've taken about 20 copies down off of YouTube now for copyright restrictions.
[01:23:35.106 --> 01:23:35.566]  No, I know.
[01:23:35.686 --> 01:23:39.309]  Every copy that we've tried to link to gets jerked down.
[01:23:39.329 --> 01:23:41.751]  We've got the councilman coming on to Mara.
[01:23:42.051 --> 01:23:45.194]  Again, the cop hits him in the back for no reason, knocks him down and beats him.
[01:23:45.234 --> 01:23:48.737]  And the news then says, Schneider got in trouble for fighting.
[01:23:49.017 --> 01:23:51.159]  So I guess when the cops attack you, that's now fighting.
[01:23:51.419 --> 01:23:52.921]  And then they arrest you for hitting you.
[01:23:53.221 --> 01:23:55.002]  And yes, they are trying to take it down.
[01:23:55.503 --> 01:23:59.166]  They're desperate to cover that up so they can keep saying that he attacked the cops.
[01:23:59.526 --> 01:24:00.747]  But there's something interesting.
[01:24:00.787 --> 01:24:04.988]  If you watch that video, right, you can see somebody else is videotaping it.
[01:24:05.028 --> 01:24:08.730]  Somebody else with a little digital camera.
[01:24:08.770 --> 01:24:10.811]  It's a woman and she's saying, get him, get him.
[01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:11.691]  She's enjoying it.
[01:24:11.951 --> 01:24:13.492]  So she's not going to be giving that video up.
[01:24:13.952 --> 01:24:16.933]  Well, she might, you know, depending on the situation.
[01:24:16.953 --> 01:24:18.374]  But that's not all I wanted to mention.
[01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:24.636]  I've been out down in downtown Austin videotaping people, asking them four questions.
[01:24:25.136 --> 01:24:26.697]  Basically, who's the vice president?
[01:24:27.236 --> 01:24:34.180]  Who's the Secretary of Defense, what day 9-11 happened on, and what the First Amendment of the Constitution is.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:37.122]  And man, I will tell you, the public is so dumbed down.
[01:24:37.622 --> 01:24:40.844]  One guy actually said September 11th happened in the year 2011.
[01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:45.912]  Most people don't know what the First Amendment of the Constitution is.
[01:24:45.932 --> 01:24:46.712]  You know why, though?
[01:24:46.952 --> 01:24:49.774]  And by the way, they've got studies where like half of Americans don't even know what year it is.
[01:24:50.275 --> 01:24:52.356]  The reason is they're mesmerized.
[01:24:52.376 --> 01:25:03.724]  When you watch the average adult four and a half hours of TV, the average child five and a half hours is growing, gamers an average of ten hours, you literally get mesmerized where you're not in a conscious state.
[01:25:03.764 --> 01:25:04.845]  So they're sleepwalking.
[01:25:04.865 --> 01:25:06.006]  They're under mind control.
[01:25:06.604 --> 01:25:14.529]  You know, even though all that's been going on in the news and all that, still about one-eighth of the people that I've interviewed still think Al Gore is the Vice President.
[01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:20.253]  Well, you've got to edit that, and, you know, down to just the questions, and get it up on Google immediately.
[01:25:20.273 --> 01:25:24.716]  In fact, I plan to do that in more films myself, or more pieces, just to illustrate.
[01:25:25.096 --> 01:25:32.922]  Have you seen the pieces where you go out with a map and say, let's attack Iraq, and you point at Australia, and nine out of ten go, yeah, let's blow that island up?
[01:25:33.162 --> 01:25:34.663]  They don't even know what Australia is!
[01:25:35.327 --> 01:25:36.368]  Yeah, I know.
[01:25:36.408 --> 01:25:38.349]  They don't even know who the Secretary of Defense is.
[01:25:38.489 --> 01:25:42.052]  In fact, about 90% of the people didn't know who the Secretary of Defense is.
[01:25:42.453 --> 01:25:50.879]  The guy that's guiding our soldiers, the guy that tells our soldiers what to do when they're sending them off to die in Iraq, and they don't even know who it is.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.301]  I mean, that's absolutely ridiculous to me.
[01:25:54.071 --> 01:25:57.493]  Listen, most Americans cannot find Iraq on a map, okay?
[01:25:57.573 --> 01:25:57.974]  Literally.
[01:25:58.094 --> 01:26:00.295]  I mean, folks, they don't know anything.
[01:26:00.335 --> 01:26:02.076]  That's why they can devalue your dollar.
[01:26:02.117 --> 01:26:05.999]  That's why they can pull you over to Checkpoint and say everyone give your blood randomly.
[01:26:06.599 --> 01:26:09.962]  And then, I mean, it's just wall-to-wall evil has taken over.
[01:26:10.302 --> 01:26:11.423]  But you know what they do know?
[01:26:11.723 --> 01:26:13.764]  They do know who Homer Simpson's son is.
[01:26:14.165 --> 01:26:16.206]  They all know that Bart Simpson is Homer Simpson's son.
[01:26:16.266 --> 01:26:17.607]  And they all know that O.J.'
[01:26:17.587 --> 01:26:19.248]  's in trouble and that all the counts are.
[01:26:19.986 --> 01:26:21.427]  Yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:26:21.467 --> 01:26:27.053]  I can't believe, I mean, I was actually shocked at the results I'm getting from just interviewing
[01:26:27.798 --> 01:26:31.720]  A wide range of people, anywhere from homeless people to people that drive Bentleys.
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:32.840]  Look, it's television.
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:34.881]  Television is literally eating the brains.
[01:26:34.921 --> 01:26:36.622]  There's hundreds of major studies on it.
[01:26:36.742 --> 01:26:39.103]  It accelerates Alzheimer's.
[01:26:39.163 --> 01:26:40.503]  It brain damages children.
[01:26:40.523 --> 01:26:42.904]  I mean, it's just so deadly.
[01:26:43.545 --> 01:26:45.445]  And a lot of them you're not going to be able to ever reach again.
[01:26:45.485 --> 01:26:46.546]  They're literally zombies.
[01:26:46.926 --> 01:26:49.707]  You know what really is good news, though?
[01:26:49.747 --> 01:26:51.808]  The one good thing that I found out about this is
[01:26:52.618 --> 01:26:53.359]  I don't know.
[01:27:09.727 --> 01:27:11.688]  They did it without having any documentaries.
[01:27:12.089 --> 01:27:16.612]  Most of them have only seen Fahrenheit 9-11, you know, and that's the biggest documentary they've ever seen.
[01:27:17.032 --> 01:27:18.753]  And they all know that it was an inside job.
[01:27:18.773 --> 01:27:23.176]  Listen, I mean, do you have video editing capability to cut out all the dead spots?
[01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:25.518]  You need to put that on YouTube or Google immediately.
[01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:26.999]  Yeah, yeah, I'll get that up.
[01:27:27.039 --> 01:27:27.659]  I'm not done yet.
[01:27:27.679 --> 01:27:29.900]  I'm going to go down today and get some more interviews and all that.
[01:27:29.941 --> 01:27:31.341]  But yeah, I'll get that up as soon as possible.
[01:27:31.361 --> 01:27:32.322]  Is this the Lucas I know?
[01:27:32.862 --> 01:27:33.043]  Yeah.
[01:27:33.243 --> 01:27:34.263]  Hey, man, how you doing, bro?
[01:27:34.684 --> 01:27:35.264]  Pretty good.
[01:27:35.384 --> 01:27:35.764]  Pretty good.
[01:27:35.804 --> 01:27:36.605]  Just working hard.
[01:27:37.025 --> 01:27:39.167]  Working hard trying to get the news out and trying to
[01:27:40.327 --> 01:27:40.887]  Spread the word.
[01:27:40.907 --> 01:27:41.747]  Well, keep it up, brother.
[01:27:41.767 --> 01:27:42.588]  I love your work.
[01:27:43.288 --> 01:27:44.808]  I've seen some of the other work he's done.
[01:27:45.328 --> 01:27:48.749]  Listen, I'm not here trying to make fun of you.
[01:27:48.869 --> 01:27:59.112]  It freaks me out that 9-11 is a total inside job right out in the open and the general public doesn't know who the vice president is and will argue with me.
[01:27:59.172 --> 01:28:02.752]  I mean, you know, it's just, believe me, I wish they didn't carry out the attacks.
[01:28:02.852 --> 01:28:05.133]  Believe me, I wish Greenspan wasn't killing the dollar.
[01:28:06.047 --> 01:28:09.149]  But again, you try to tell a yuppie what a dead dollar means, they don't know!
[01:28:09.769 --> 01:28:12.811]  Some poor Mexican who grew up in a dirt floor shack knows!
[01:28:14.713 --> 01:28:16.614]  I'll talk to the illegal aliens.
[01:28:18.975 --> 01:28:22.558]  I'll have my wife in Spanish ask him, hey, do you know about the dollar going down?
[01:28:22.718 --> 01:28:23.498]  Oh, yes, senor.
[01:28:23.538 --> 01:28:24.279]  It's very bad.
[01:28:24.699 --> 01:28:26.160]  It will be like pesos soon.
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:27.621]  We are so sad.
[01:28:28.348 --> 01:28:30.889]  You tell a yuppie, what's a dollar bill?
[01:28:31.489 --> 01:28:34.830]  Oh, it's a black helicopter, huh?
[01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:38.952]  I mean, precondition to just reject any information.
[01:28:39.472 --> 01:28:41.213]  Fine, you're gonna be in deep trouble.
[01:28:43.954 --> 01:28:44.874]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.354 --> 01:28:46.955]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.875 --> 01:28:50.576]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.817 --> 01:28:59.319]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:28:59.759 --> 01:29:03.981]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:04.401 --> 01:29:11.264]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:11.704 --> 01:29:18.407]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:18.727 --> 01:29:20.348]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:29:20.648 --> 01:29:23.830]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.090 --> 01:29:26.551]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:29:26.851 --> 01:29:33.594]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.034 --> 01:29:36.716]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:29:40.399 --> 01:29:40.759]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:40.799 --> 01:29:42.581]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:29:54.150 --> 01:30:02.214]  Hi, this is Jeff Rents, and if you're interested in suppressed and natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:30:02.594 --> 01:30:11.898]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:30:12.258 --> 01:30:16.580]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:29.186]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery and arthritis.
[01:30:29.446 --> 01:30:34.388]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:30:34.768 --> 01:30:37.310]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound.
[01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:38.130]  And the best part?
[01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:39.991]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:30:40.071 --> 01:30:41.752]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:30:41.912 --> 01:30:44.413]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:30:44.813 --> 01:30:45.854]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:30:45.914 --> 01:30:52.619]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:55.801]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:57.983]  Look, up there in the sky.
[01:30:58.403 --> 01:30:59.704]  It's Non-X-Man.
[01:30:59.724 --> 01:31:01.285]  He's in a dive.
[01:31:01.566 --> 01:31:03.547]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[01:31:03.867 --> 01:31:04.628]  Let's go look.
[01:31:06.850 --> 01:31:10.032]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X-Nail Gel.
[01:31:10.452 --> 01:31:11.793]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[01:31:12.014 --> 01:31:12.434]  Take them out.
[01:31:13.064 --> 01:31:13.744]  Let's see.
[01:31:13.764 --> 01:31:18.327]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:31:18.687 --> 01:31:19.147]  Don't worry.
[01:31:19.607 --> 01:31:21.128]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:31:21.748 --> 01:31:26.171]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:31:26.691 --> 01:31:28.772]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[01:31:28.892 --> 01:31:31.633]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:31:33.735 --> 01:31:36.376]  Don't let Non-X Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:31:36.856 --> 01:31:40.318]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:31:40.838 --> 01:31:42.559]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters,
[01:31:44.002 --> 01:32:07.112]  Millions and millions of surveillance cameras in London when the crime rate goes up.
[01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:20.255]  Hire more police, the crime rate goes up.
[01:32:20.335 --> 01:32:24.099]  Or stays the same, depending on the region you're in.
[01:32:24.139 --> 01:32:27.382]  More on highway checkpoint, demands blood from all the drivers.
[01:32:30.586 --> 01:32:34.169]  More on the financial news, coming up.
[01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:38.634]  But I'm gonna go to Kim and Jason and Richard and Nathaniel and Frank, everybody first.
[01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:51.873]  But before I do that, Ted Anderson was actually out getting his tires rotated, I guess at lunch about 45 minutes ago, and I said, listen, he's the owner of the network.
[01:32:53.094 --> 01:32:54.734]  He's who I buy precious metals from.
[01:32:54.854 --> 01:32:55.995]  I said, come back in right now.
[01:32:57.895 --> 01:32:59.936]  Gold is up $10 from yesterday.
[01:33:01.940 --> 01:33:03.882]  I said, I forgot to get my order in yesterday.
[01:33:03.902 --> 01:33:13.049]  I want to make sure because a few weeks ago I tried to order some and was too busy and never put the order in and didn't get the couple coins I wanted when it was 50 bucks cheaper than it is now.
[01:33:13.550 --> 01:33:19.555]  And I said, uh-uh, you come in because I want to get them from you and I want three or four coins today.
[01:33:20.851 --> 01:33:23.352]  Even though they've gone up, and he goes, don't worry, we've still got some.
[01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:26.233]  It's yesterday's prices, which were last week's prices.
[01:33:26.813 --> 01:33:32.695]  Folks, gold is up $10 an ounce, but Ted has numismatic collector coins at near melt.
[01:33:32.735 --> 01:33:36.096]  That is, you're paying near bullion, but it has collector value.
[01:33:36.176 --> 01:33:37.237]  It's a super deal.
[01:33:38.377 --> 01:33:46.060]  He's got a secondary super collector coin, as well, that is just an incredibly good deal, but they've got Swiss and French francs.
[01:33:46.713 --> 01:33:52.660]  From the 1900s, early 1900s, turn of the century, 1900 through the 20s and 30s, these are a great buy.
[01:33:52.700 --> 01:33:53.801]  It's what I'm getting a couple of.
[01:33:54.142 --> 01:33:55.583]  Every few months I try to buy a few of these.
[01:33:55.603 --> 01:33:56.384]  They're British Sovereigns.
[01:33:56.825 --> 01:34:00.329]  I like little coins, and over the years I've built up a few of them.
[01:34:01.590 --> 01:34:02.511]  This is the buy.
[01:34:02.752 --> 01:34:03.693]  This is a great deal.
[01:34:04.551 --> 01:34:07.036]  Greenspan announced the end of the dollar this weekend.
[01:34:08.198 --> 01:34:14.630]  All these countries from Venezuela to Saudi Arabia, 800 plus billion, are announcing it's not going to be the reserve currency.
[01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:16.574]  It's not going to be tied to oil anymore.
[01:34:18.872 --> 01:34:20.493]  Get out of the dollar while you can.
[01:34:20.713 --> 01:34:22.153]  Gold is only going to go up.
[01:34:22.473 --> 01:34:24.614]  You watch it on a yearly graph, it goes straight up.
[01:34:25.014 --> 01:34:27.535]  Is it going to go down $20 in a month?
[01:34:27.675 --> 01:34:27.955]  Maybe.
[01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:28.995]  Or tomorrow?
[01:34:29.075 --> 01:34:29.375]  Maybe.
[01:34:29.556 --> 01:34:31.856]  But is it going to go up even higher in six months?
[01:34:31.936 --> 01:34:33.477]  Guaranteed.
[01:34:33.497 --> 01:34:34.997]  Because it's so undervalued.
[01:34:35.277 --> 01:34:43.040]  Ted, I'm only going to have you a few minutes, but I just wanted to have you on today because you've supported this network, you've created the Genesis Network,
[01:34:44.534 --> 01:34:48.137]  And you've done so much to support freedom.
[01:34:48.177 --> 01:34:49.558]  You're offering such good deals.
[01:34:50.178 --> 01:34:52.420]  And I just am so mad at the bankers.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:54.421]  I know they tell people don't get into gold.
[01:34:55.342 --> 01:34:56.422]  I know that this will hurt them.
[01:34:56.823 --> 01:34:59.384]  Just like everybody that drinks out of a water filter.
[01:34:59.424 --> 01:34:59.945]  And I don't care.
[01:34:59.965 --> 01:35:01.466]  Just make sure it's a high quality one, folks.
[01:35:02.857 --> 01:35:04.158]  The poison didn't get into them.
[01:35:04.218 --> 01:35:07.460]  Every person that doesn't take the vaccine, they didn't get to brain damage that child.
[01:35:07.821 --> 01:35:09.162]  I love blocking these people.
[01:35:09.202 --> 01:35:11.383]  I'm like a sheep dog that loves jumping in front of wolves.
[01:35:11.443 --> 01:35:13.505]  It's like a dog likes to catch frisbees.
[01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:16.207]  I like to give good tips to my listeners.
[01:35:16.747 --> 01:35:22.571]  And I know I'm ranting here, it's just... It's 7.32 right now, boys and girls.
[01:35:22.651 --> 01:35:24.293]  A few weeks ago it was 7.60, I mean 6.60 something.
[01:35:27.862 --> 01:35:29.303]  Last time I bought gold, it was at about $6.65.
[01:35:31.105 --> 01:35:34.068]  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to buy.
[01:35:34.128 --> 01:35:37.030]  It's only going to go up because... Well, Ted, I want to ask you.
[01:35:37.451 --> 01:35:40.453]  Greenspan announcing that the dollar is going to be replaced with the euro.
[01:35:40.834 --> 01:35:43.456]  Today, having the Saudis dump it.
[01:35:43.576 --> 01:35:45.518]  Yesterday, having the Venezuelans dump it.
[01:35:45.758 --> 01:35:46.739]  This is freaking me out.
[01:35:46.779 --> 01:35:49.001]  This is happening faster than I thought it would, Ted.
[01:35:49.261 --> 01:35:57.146]  Alex, we financed our economy all throughout the 1980s and the 1990s by going into debt and sending our U.S.
[01:35:57.206 --> 01:35:59.327]  Treasury bonds, bills, and notes overseas.
[01:35:59.807 --> 01:36:05.050]  Those Treasury bills, bonds, and notes are coming back home to roost now and that means the value of our U.S.
[01:36:05.090 --> 01:36:06.751]  dollars are going to dump into the toilet.
[01:36:07.072 --> 01:36:09.433]  It's been the fear of every economist out there.
[01:36:09.893 --> 01:36:11.554]  Everybody has set alarm on it.
[01:36:11.614 --> 01:36:13.255]  Most people would say, no it can't happen.
[01:36:13.275 --> 01:36:15.096]  These people can't afford to take those losses.
[01:36:15.116 --> 01:36:16.077]  Well, they're taking them now.
[01:36:16.557 --> 01:36:25.245]  The United States dollar is no question, no hands down doomed because I mean right now China's sitting on, they've threatened their 1.3 trillion.
[01:36:25.625 --> 01:36:27.167]  It's going to drive interest rates up.
[01:36:27.207 --> 01:36:33.753]  The Federal Reserve System will have no choice than to open up the, and I want to be clear,
[01:36:34.844 --> 01:36:41.687]  If Greenspan used to burp the economy went down, all of them came out and bashed the dollar savagely this weekend.
[01:36:41.747 --> 01:36:43.107]  They are behind this, Ted.
[01:36:43.247 --> 01:36:59.834]  Well, the thing is, the Federal Reserve System is going to have to create the liquidity to keep the interest rates down, to keep the United States economy going, but it's going to be sending us into this... I mean, the fiat currency here is going to be similar to Argentina and Brazil, and you're talking about that Mexican guy that knows what it's like to live through this.
[01:37:00.174 --> 01:37:07.561]  The United States people have never had to feel the pain of a currency falling as fast as currencies can fall.
[01:37:07.941 --> 01:37:11.624]  By the way, this is what finally caused the collapse of the Roman Empire.
[01:37:12.065 --> 01:37:12.765]  It certainly did.
[01:37:12.805 --> 01:37:15.568]  Because they couldn't pay their armies anymore to hold back the Visigoths.
[01:37:15.908 --> 01:37:17.909]  And look at the Weimar Republic.
[01:37:17.969 --> 01:37:19.049]  It was the same thing.
[01:37:19.069 --> 01:37:25.571]  They created way too much debt than the taxpayers could afford to pay, and the value of the currency went right through the toilet.
[01:37:25.811 --> 01:37:27.491]  The same thing happened in Argentina.
[01:37:27.531 --> 01:37:28.952]  The same thing happened in Brazil.
[01:37:29.272 --> 01:37:30.772]  The same thing happened in Mexico.
[01:37:30.832 --> 01:37:33.813]  The same thing happened in several of the Balkan states.
[01:37:33.833 --> 01:37:35.033]  It certainly happened in Russia.
[01:37:35.354 --> 01:37:36.834]  We are not immune from this.
[01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:43.556]  The only reason why the United States dollar has been able to do as well as it has for the last 20 years, and us be able to
[01:37:44.156 --> 01:38:02.886]  Deficit spend like it's going out of business, completely without any... It was because the establishment had the weapons of the military and they said there was confidence to have Greenspan, Volcker, Bernanke, the Treasury Secretary, the Exchequer, all of them come out and bad-mount the dollar.
[01:38:02.946 --> 01:38:12.071]  I want to make it clear, they gave the cue to precipitate Venezuela and to precipitate... I don't know if you got this news, Ted, did you know the Saudis just
[01:38:13.252 --> 01:38:15.394]  Unhedge their currency from the dollar today?
[01:38:15.474 --> 01:38:16.875]  Yeah, you just mentioned that earlier.
[01:38:16.895 --> 01:38:22.121]  You know, I haven't had a chance to see that particular story, but there's so much going on in the economic world right now.
[01:38:22.141 --> 01:38:23.002]  Yeah, but that's a big deal.
[01:38:23.042 --> 01:38:25.244]  I mean, the Saudis hold $800 million.
[01:38:25.444 --> 01:38:27.907]  That's almost as the 1.2 trill the Chinese have got.
[01:38:27.987 --> 01:38:29.528]  Well, it's the oil.
[01:38:29.928 --> 01:38:32.370]  The United States dollar was fixed to oil.
[01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:33.190]  It's not anymore.
[01:38:33.230 --> 01:38:37.293]  The United States dollar holding world status, that's dead.
[01:38:37.333 --> 01:38:41.396]  There is no more United States dollar being the world currency.
[01:38:41.456 --> 01:38:41.936]  It's gone.
[01:38:42.276 --> 01:38:43.057]  We've lost that.
[01:38:43.237 --> 01:38:44.858]  Are you mad, Ted?
[01:38:45.158 --> 01:38:46.859]  I mean, I'm physically mad right now.
[01:38:47.079 --> 01:38:51.202]  I tell you, it's ruining our children's future.
[01:38:51.522 --> 01:38:54.404]  The United States has sold itself, sold its soul.
[01:38:55.304 --> 01:38:59.967]  We definitely have set up this process.
[01:39:01.548 --> 01:39:18.937]  Alex, you say that the Merrill and the Euro currency, I really truly believe that the people that are in control of the United States dollar, which is not the government currency, the Federal Reserve System owns this currency, they are steering us right into a world currency.
[01:39:18.977 --> 01:39:20.338]  We're going to be paying world taxes.
[01:39:20.358 --> 01:39:21.839]  They're doing this by design.
[01:39:22.359 --> 01:39:31.503]  And I want it on record, they said they were going to do this in 2000, in the 70s, they were just six years late, seven years late, and it is so sick.
[01:39:31.563 --> 01:39:36.886]  Ted, I know I've got you on about economics now, but tell people about the gold deal, so maybe they listen to us.
[01:39:37.206 --> 01:39:38.106]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:39:38.146 --> 01:39:41.388]  I mean, yesterday I was on air, we were talking about the very same thing I'm going to offer.
[01:39:41.428 --> 01:39:44.089]  Again, I'm going to offer it at the same price, and gold did go up.
[01:39:44.649 --> 01:39:49.794]  $10 an ounce so obviously this is even a better deal now at this particular time.
[01:39:50.234 --> 01:39:52.336]  I have French and Swiss francs.
[01:39:52.396 --> 01:39:54.558]  They're $153 per coin.
[01:39:55.058 --> 01:39:58.381]  That is just a steal and you need to get out a dollar.
[01:39:58.441 --> 01:39:59.542]  You need to get into gold.
[01:39:59.922 --> 01:40:03.805]  And in addition to this there's only about 500,000 coins that the US Mint issued in 1984 to commemorate the Olympics.
[01:40:07.638 --> 01:40:11.820]  And this coin was sold as a collector coin by the US Mint.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.842]  That means they can't go back and say this is a bullion coin.
[01:40:14.862 --> 01:40:15.862]  We're confiscating it.
[01:40:16.302 --> 01:40:20.264]  It is private gold and it is a good way to get involved in the marketplace.
[01:40:20.304 --> 01:40:22.465]  They're $528 for coin.
[01:40:22.785 --> 01:40:25.487]  They're encapsulized in the original government holders.
[01:40:25.507 --> 01:40:26.467]  They're in perfect shape.
[01:40:26.827 --> 01:40:30.029]  They're a proof condition or they're in the business strike condition.
[01:40:30.069 --> 01:40:32.330]  Either one, a fabulous way to get involved.
[01:40:32.370 --> 01:40:33.790]  And I can tell you when there's only $500,000 to go around
[01:40:35.371 --> 01:40:37.692]  There isn't enough to go around for everybody in the Twin Cities.
[01:40:37.752 --> 01:40:39.913]  It would barely reach the population.
[01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:42.194]  Yeah, that means nationwide, worldwide, there's only 500,000 of those.
[01:40:42.214 --> 01:40:46.136]  That's a super collector coin at very close to melt.
[01:40:46.196 --> 01:40:47.076]  A super good deal.
[01:40:47.096 --> 01:40:48.457]  Give them the phone number, Ted.
[01:40:48.597 --> 01:40:49.717]  The number to call us is 1-800-686-7000.
[01:40:51.718 --> 01:40:55.999]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:40:56.339 --> 01:41:06.402]  May I remind you, when I was on with British Sovereigns here just a month ago, the people that bought those coins not only supported the network and helped get the message put forward, they are now sitting in a profitable position.
[01:41:06.442 --> 01:41:09.183]  They can sell back to me for more money than they paid.
[01:41:09.203 --> 01:41:11.884]  Let's see, they brought British Sovereigns at about $680 an ounce.
[01:41:13.824 --> 01:41:18.688]  Then that means they have made 20 and 32.
[01:41:18.908 --> 01:41:22.951]  That means they've made 50 plus dollars in a month.
[01:41:23.171 --> 01:41:24.052]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:41:24.072 --> 01:41:24.613]  Per coin.
[01:41:24.753 --> 01:41:26.434]  And are they really making money?
[01:41:26.494 --> 01:41:26.634]  No.
[01:41:26.674 --> 01:41:29.416]  What's happening out there is the people who are sitting in U.S.
[01:41:29.476 --> 01:41:30.918]  dollar are getting eaten alive.
[01:41:30.958 --> 01:41:31.918]  Yeah, that's it folks.
[01:41:31.998 --> 01:41:32.299]  Listen.
[01:41:32.659 --> 01:41:32.939]  Listen.
[01:41:32.979 --> 01:41:33.780]  The gold's real.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:34.260]  Okay?
[01:41:34.300 --> 01:41:35.301]  And it's only going to go up.
[01:41:36.002 --> 01:41:37.825]  Okay, are there going to be some valleys?
[01:41:37.905 --> 01:41:38.165]  Yes.
[01:41:38.265 --> 01:41:45.815]  But I'm telling you, just like I've been saying since 2000 when it was 300 bucks an ounce, if you don't get into gold and silver right now, you're completely insane.
[01:41:45.835 --> 01:41:45.915]  800-686-2237.
[01:41:45.935 --> 01:41:48.098]  You usually hear Ted on my show twice a year, okay?
[01:41:50.902 --> 01:41:51.102]  Yeah.
[01:41:51.182 --> 01:41:52.723]  I'm having him on two days in a row.
[01:41:53.023 --> 01:41:54.924]  I dragged him in here when he was getting his car serviced.
[01:41:54.964 --> 01:41:58.005]  I said just leave because I wanted to warn the audience.
[01:41:58.025 --> 01:42:01.927]  You better get into Gold 800-686-2237 800-686-2237 or you can listen to CNN Money Report and they'll tell you to stay and stop.
[01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:09.290]  Oh yeah, that's right.
[01:42:09.310 --> 01:42:10.291]  That's exactly right.
[01:42:10.331 --> 01:42:11.652]  And just think about it for a second.
[01:42:11.692 --> 01:42:14.833]  If you had a retirement plan that you put together, you might as well forget about it.
[01:42:14.873 --> 01:42:19.956]  Because you might have a million dollars, but that million dollars may not even buy you a used car.
[01:42:20.236 --> 01:42:21.897]  That's where it's going right now.
[01:42:21.917 --> 01:42:27.600]  People in Argentina fell asleep one night, woke up the next morning, and the country devaluated the currency by 50%.
[01:42:29.121 --> 01:42:31.563]  Then the IMF and World Bank documents came out two years later.
[01:42:31.583 --> 01:42:32.964]  It was all by design.
[01:42:32.984 --> 01:42:33.725]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:42:35.146 --> 01:42:37.407]  Ted, thanks for coming on again.
[01:42:37.427 --> 01:42:38.909]  Hey, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[01:42:39.349 --> 01:42:39.749]  You bet.
[01:42:39.829 --> 01:42:42.852]  And again, if you don't get gold from Ted, fine.
[01:42:43.032 --> 01:42:44.393]  But he gives you really good prices.
[01:42:44.433 --> 01:42:47.135]  I mean, those two deals are great deals to take advantage of.
[01:42:47.295 --> 01:42:47.695]  800-686-2237.
[01:42:47.715 --> 01:42:48.015]  800-686-2237.
[01:42:49.236 --> 01:42:56.619]  They also have some pre-economic reports you can get by Dr. Corsi and some other great things.
[01:42:56.659 --> 01:42:58.019]  Alright, I appreciate callers holding.
[01:42:58.059 --> 01:42:59.700]  Now I'm going to take calls into the next hour.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:02.781]  Then I'm going to get into all the police state war news, the rest of it.
[01:43:04.061 --> 01:43:06.762]  I'm just trying to have some type of control in my life.
[01:43:09.824 --> 01:43:13.525]  I mean, they're just completely destroying the country right now.
[01:43:13.705 --> 01:43:14.745]  I don't know how to explain it to you.
[01:43:17.131 --> 01:43:19.153]  I'm almost speechless like I've been since Monday.
[01:43:23.316 --> 01:43:27.639]  And so the public won't know they cut interest rates that made the crisis even worse.
[01:43:29.981 --> 01:43:33.944]  So the public wouldn't even know that that was worse.
[01:43:35.665 --> 01:43:40.109]  And the public was told it was a solution and so their stupid stock market went up.
[01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:42.611]  And so they think everything's fine.
[01:43:42.891 --> 01:43:44.072]  I just can't believe it.
[01:43:46.064 --> 01:43:50.546]  I know I keep just babbling, bumbling here.
[01:43:52.006 --> 01:44:00.169]  To watch the open rape of the nation, because we don't have the factories, we don't have the high educational standards, we don't have the inventors, we don't have the smart people anymore.
[01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:10.313]  We're just a nation of decadent slobs, myself included, who all we had was the dollar, and they're taking that away!
[01:44:10.353 --> 01:44:14.595]  They're taking it away.
[01:44:17.452 --> 01:44:21.214]  And it may go back up a little bit next week, but if you watch the trend, it's straight down.
[01:44:25.956 --> 01:44:30.378]  And they wouldn't do this if they didn't think they could sell it that they were the saviors, you see.
[01:44:31.078 --> 01:44:33.099]  They wouldn't do this if they thought you'd stand up.
[01:44:33.559 --> 01:44:34.620]  If they thought you understood.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:42.223]  But when you got a public, as the caller said earlier, filmmaker I know, he's been down in Austin for weeks off and on interviewing people, and
[01:44:43.763 --> 01:44:46.225]  One in eight people, he said, knows who the Vice President is.
[01:44:46.245 --> 01:44:47.206]  Folks, they're devastated.
[01:44:47.246 --> 01:44:48.727]  Their minds are devastated.
[01:44:50.748 --> 01:44:55.711]  They know who the football teams are, and they know how to act cool at cocktail parties.
[01:44:55.811 --> 01:44:57.513]  But folks, other than that, they don't know anything.
[01:44:58.433 --> 01:45:08.560]  And they, these yuppies and their servants and the blue-collar cops and the rest of them, if it means a paycheck, folks, and the government blames people like me for what happened to the economy, they will man death camps.
[01:45:09.244 --> 01:45:11.045]  Make no mistake, you think the Germans were corrupt?
[01:45:11.365 --> 01:45:13.246]  I mean, the people today love Jack Bauer.
[01:45:15.107 --> 01:45:16.348]  This is all planned out.
[01:45:17.328 --> 01:45:18.349]  It's all planned out.
[01:45:21.311 --> 01:45:22.751]  Kim in Texas, thanks for holding.
[01:45:22.991 --> 01:45:23.732]  I really appreciate it.
[01:45:23.752 --> 01:45:24.072]  Go ahead.
[01:45:24.092 --> 01:45:25.813]  Hey Alex.
[01:45:26.113 --> 01:45:26.453]  Hi.
[01:45:27.074 --> 01:45:34.558]  My question is, you touched on it, when you do get the gold coins, how do you keep the government from collecting it like they did before?
[01:45:35.058 --> 01:45:36.899]  Well... And my second question is,
[01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:40.251]  Um, what is the exact inflation rate right now?
[01:45:40.371 --> 01:45:41.932]  I'm saying 20% myself.
[01:45:43.913 --> 01:45:44.333]  Okay.
[01:45:46.054 --> 01:46:01.824]  Number one, back in 1933 when they declared federal martial law, set up the Federal Police known as State Police, and started taking over and started socializing and giving people slave numbers and Social Security and the rest of it and telling you driving was a privilege and the rest of it, which it wasn't.
[01:46:02.424 --> 01:46:07.087]  Back when we went under occupation of the New World Order and the Bank of England, about
[01:46:08.917 --> 01:46:09.757]  I don't know the percentage.
[01:46:09.837 --> 01:46:12.538]  I mean, looking at numbers, it says everybody held gold.
[01:46:12.838 --> 01:46:15.259]  I don't know if that's the case, but I would imagine 98% of people.
[01:46:15.679 --> 01:46:16.920]  Almost everyone had gold.
[01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.980]  Gold was still the money.
[01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:18.860]  Silver was still the money.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:22.322]  I mean, a quarter in your pocket was almost pure silver.
[01:46:23.802 --> 01:46:30.044]  Gold coins, you know, you'd have a $10 gold piece that was, you know, really worth about $20.
[01:46:30.104 --> 01:46:32.545]  There'd been that much inflation since the start of the country.
[01:46:34.219 --> 01:46:39.421]  And so they just announced, we were a very subservient country by then, that we're the good government.
[01:46:40.041 --> 01:46:41.221]  Just turn your gold in.
[01:46:41.241 --> 01:46:42.702]  No one's accepting gold now.
[01:46:42.762 --> 01:46:43.902]  No corporations or banks.
[01:46:43.982 --> 01:46:44.942]  We'll give you paperback.
[01:46:45.282 --> 01:46:47.023]  And then they publicly shipped it all to Europe.
[01:46:47.043 --> 01:46:47.683]  It was on the news.
[01:46:48.323 --> 01:46:49.044]  It was in the papers.
[01:46:49.524 --> 01:46:54.785]  And then one year after all the gold was out of the U.S., they then doubled prices and the European banks that own us literally laughed about it.
[01:46:55.465 --> 01:46:55.746]  U.S.
[01:46:55.766 --> 01:46:58.406]  companies got caught setting up dummy corporations to buy gold in Europe.
[01:46:58.426 --> 01:46:59.247]  They would all get arrested.
[01:46:59.727 --> 01:47:03.708]  The Firestone family, the head of the company got arrested for trying to do it, the tire company.
[01:47:04.877 --> 01:47:05.498]  It's all history.
[01:47:05.538 --> 01:47:06.639]  My grandmother remembers it happening.
[01:47:06.959 --> 01:47:17.406]  Today, about five percent, in fact I saw that number last week and I heard another gold broker on air talking about it and reading the numbers yesterday, five percent of the country roughly holds gold.
[01:47:18.327 --> 01:47:20.208]  And even less hold physical gold.
[01:47:20.268 --> 01:47:22.890]  Listen, the general public thinks mercury is good for them.
[01:47:23.290 --> 01:47:27.133]  They don't know about this investment that more than doubled the last six years.
[01:47:28.494 --> 01:47:33.117]  They don't know about an investment that went up fifty bucks an ounce in the last month.
[01:47:34.156 --> 01:47:41.759]  So, there's no point in confiscating gold, because 95% of people don't even probably know what gold is.
[01:47:41.819 --> 01:47:44.520]  I mean, they just think it's, they know it's a jewelry or something.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.761]  They don't even know that it's an element.
[01:47:46.801 --> 01:47:48.222]  They don't know it comes out of the ground.
[01:47:48.562 --> 01:47:50.163]  I mean, literally, these people don't know anything.
[01:47:50.503 --> 01:48:00.907]  You've got to, you've got to, you can't overestimate how dumb they are, and how dumb down they are, and how mesmerized and brainwashed, is really the word, not even dumb, they're more, they're more under a spell.
[01:48:02.343 --> 01:48:05.045]  You know, they know all the football scores, but they don't know about gold.
[01:48:05.985 --> 01:48:10.227]  And so the danger of them confiscating your gold is very, very low.
[01:48:10.648 --> 01:48:14.109]  But if they come for your gold, they're probably coming for your guns, too.
[01:48:14.970 --> 01:48:16.571]  And nothing is safe.
[01:48:16.611 --> 01:48:18.112]  They could take your house, take your car.
[01:48:18.552 --> 01:48:24.135]  The point is, is that they can't invisibly steal the value overnight, as they're right now doing to paper.
[01:48:25.635 --> 01:48:28.237]  See, so that's why gold is such a good investment.
[01:48:28.457 --> 01:48:30.218]  And again, Ron Paul comes on this show.
[01:48:31.138 --> 01:48:34.180]  He's not affiliated with gold sales like I am, trying to support the network.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:35.641]  I mean, he tells you, get gold!
[01:48:35.681 --> 01:48:36.181]  Get it fast!
[01:48:36.221 --> 01:48:36.481]  Get it!
[01:48:36.521 --> 01:48:36.741]  Get it!
[01:48:36.761 --> 01:48:38.422]  You know, inflation tax!
[01:48:38.462 --> 01:48:39.363]  Inflation tax!
[01:48:39.983 --> 01:48:41.364]  He said it could blow any time!
[01:48:41.944 --> 01:48:43.385]  And well, look what's happening right now!
[01:48:44.205 --> 01:48:51.149]  And believe me, when these yuppies find out and learn what the currency devaluation means, they're going to be trying to snatch gold up at any price.
[01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:55.452]  But they won't admit that they were brainwashed ten years ago not to buy gold.
[01:48:55.732 --> 01:48:56.973]  They're still saying gold is bad.
[01:48:56.993 --> 01:48:57.613]  Do you understand that?
[01:49:00.816 --> 01:49:01.816]  Does that answer your question, Kim?
[01:49:02.076 --> 01:49:02.617]  Yes, it does.
[01:49:03.037 --> 01:49:03.917]  And then what was the other one?
[01:49:04.197 --> 01:49:04.978]  Inflation rate.
[01:49:05.158 --> 01:49:05.718]  Oh, inflation.
[01:49:05.738 --> 01:49:06.318]  Thanks for the call.
[01:49:06.598 --> 01:49:11.220]  They have different brokerage firms, different companies, and different institutions that look at that.
[01:49:12.901 --> 01:49:18.062]  The government says it's at about 7% right now, and that's with Cook Books.
[01:49:18.763 --> 01:49:26.205]  A lot of the big economic firms and top economists are saying that we've got about a 13.6% annual
[01:49:33.354 --> 01:49:35.516]  And that's just what we're feeling right now.
[01:49:36.037 --> 01:49:39.440]  In certain sectors, it's 15-20%.
[01:49:41.222 --> 01:49:47.488]  In energy, it's been about 30% a year, if you take the last four years' increases and average them together.
[01:49:49.110 --> 01:49:49.931]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:50:00.062]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.402 --> 01:50:02.363]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:50:02.723 --> 01:50:10.387]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.067 --> 01:50:18.091]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.511 --> 01:50:25.375]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:25.894 --> 01:50:29.915]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.235 --> 01:50:33.716]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.216 --> 01:50:35.897]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.457 --> 01:50:40.378]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:50.567 --> 01:51:52.467]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.168 --> 01:51:55.288]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle, M.D.
[01:51:55.428 --> 01:51:57.708]  of the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[01:51:57.848 --> 01:52:00.829]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[01:52:00.889 --> 01:52:01.529]  is a real thing.
[01:52:01.629 --> 01:52:08.531]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer from fresh, never before available garlic.
[01:52:08.651 --> 01:52:09.531]  Allicin molecules
[01:52:09.571 --> 01:52:09.911]  I don't know.
[01:52:28.491 --> 01:52:40.758]  Order today for fighting disease, turning on your immune system, activating infection-fighting properties against sinus, lung, bowel, skin, Lyme disease, nail fungus, colds, flu, ringworm, gum disease, diarrhea, athlete's foot, and cholesterol.

[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:44.920]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[01:52:44.940 --> 01:52:47.801]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:53:01.636 --> 01:53:09.005]  By the way, I didn't mean for this song to play now, but it is fortuitous.
[01:53:21.578 --> 01:53:31.723]  Chris Ritter, local activist, brought me all these documents about eight months ago at the TV station.
[01:53:33.263 --> 01:53:34.884]  And they're somewhere around here.
[01:53:34.904 --> 01:53:36.525]  There's piles of things everywhere.
[01:53:36.565 --> 01:53:42.488]  I mean, I don't want to tell this story about how I don't read everything because then you won't send stuff that I have no chance of seeing.
[01:53:43.346 --> 01:53:46.708]  But I did read all this, and then I just forgot to ever do a story on it.
[01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:49.170]  I think I threw it at Aaron Dykes, actually.
[01:53:50.071 --> 01:53:52.453]  I'm looking it out the window, editing video right now.
[01:53:52.473 --> 01:53:54.634]  We just don't have the personnel, the money to hire the personnel we need.
[01:53:59.718 --> 01:54:03.580]  It was all these documents about how they're going to adopt Spanish curriculum.
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:06.883]  I mean, the actual Mexican curriculum, U.S.
[01:54:06.923 --> 01:54:07.243]  government
[01:54:07.955 --> 01:54:14.700]  He's going to adopt Mexican government curriculum in Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado.
[01:54:16.561 --> 01:54:18.402]  And you tell people that and they laugh at you.
[01:54:18.422 --> 01:54:21.004]  I mention it on air and people are like, let me see the proof, and I never got to it.
[01:54:21.384 --> 01:54:22.225]  Well, here it is.
[01:54:23.146 --> 01:54:25.267]  KGW.com.
[01:54:25.727 --> 01:54:28.389]  We'll get it up on PrisonPlanet.com right now in Jones Report.
[01:54:28.890 --> 01:54:30.511]  In fact, Aaron, Aaron just gave me this.
[01:54:30.611 --> 01:54:32.092]  Will you get this up on Jones Report right now?
[01:54:34.275 --> 01:54:39.602]  Will you get this, how they're going to teach the official Mexican curriculum in the schools?
[01:54:40.262 --> 01:54:40.543]  The what?
[01:54:41.904 --> 01:54:45.148]  No, no, no, this one you gave me about the Mexican, yeah, yeah, this one.
[01:54:45.869 --> 01:54:46.951]  Will you post that on Jones4 right now?
[01:54:47.411 --> 01:54:47.732]  Thanks.
[01:54:49.414 --> 01:54:50.375]  Anyways, um...
[01:54:52.322 --> 01:54:56.024]  Some Oregon high schools are adopting Mexico's public school curriculum.
[01:54:56.284 --> 01:54:56.944]  Now, did you hear that?
[01:54:57.344 --> 01:55:06.029]  To help educate Spanish-speaking students with textbooks, an online website, DVDs, and CDs provided free by Mexico to teach math, science, and even U.S.
[01:55:06.069 --> 01:55:06.369]  history.
[01:55:06.609 --> 01:55:08.490]  I mean, they're colonizing us, no doubt.
[01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:09.690]  And the big banks love it.
[01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:10.891]  Anything to break up the U.S.
[01:55:12.892 --> 01:55:14.012]  They're destroying our dollar.
[01:55:14.553 --> 01:55:19.555]  We've got 30 million illegal aliens here in the country, all guaranteed to have at least four children.
[01:55:20.541 --> 01:55:22.903]  They do not want to assimilate and become Americans.
[01:55:22.943 --> 01:55:24.605]  They openly say they hate America.
[01:55:24.625 --> 01:55:27.408]  I mean, this is all over the restaurants, the stores.
[01:55:27.468 --> 01:55:29.430]  I mean, why are we going to lie about it?
[01:55:29.550 --> 01:55:30.511]  Why not be honest?
[01:55:31.531 --> 01:55:33.633]  And it goes on to say Texas, all over.
[01:55:35.555 --> 01:55:37.257]  But see, it says Austin, Texas.
[01:55:37.297 --> 01:55:39.219]  But see, that's not the big story here.
[01:55:39.899 --> 01:55:42.802]  Chris Rigger gave me the actual school-issued documents.
[01:55:44.123 --> 01:55:45.685]  Because her sister's a schoolteacher.
[01:55:47.000 --> 01:55:48.601]  Was it her sister or sister-in-law?
[01:55:48.621 --> 01:55:50.642]  I gotta get Ritter on the show.
[01:55:50.662 --> 01:55:55.404]  In fact, Ritter, you got my number, you're listening probably, or somebody is in your family.
[01:55:55.424 --> 01:55:56.464]  I want you in studio.
[01:55:56.484 --> 01:55:59.665]  Or I get your sister, whoever is on.
[01:55:59.685 --> 01:56:00.926]  I think it's sister-in-law.
[01:56:01.046 --> 01:56:01.526]  Whatever.
[01:56:02.166 --> 01:56:06.608]  The point is, is now it's in the Associated Press on KGW.com.
[01:56:06.688 --> 01:56:06.788]  AP.
[01:56:10.117 --> 01:56:20.561]  Some Oregon high schools are adopting Mexico's public school curriculum to help educate Spanish-speaking students with textbooks, an online website, DVD provided by Mexico, who has dual citizenship and says this is Mexico.
[01:56:20.841 --> 01:56:22.202]  So they want them to have dual citizenship.
[01:56:22.582 --> 01:56:30.385]  The Oregon Department of Education and Mexico's Secretary of Public Education are discussing aligning their curriculum so courses will be valid in both countries.
[01:56:30.445 --> 01:56:31.746]  But see, this is the big news.
[01:56:33.667 --> 01:56:38.909]  In the documents Ritter gave me, which are somewhere in this office, it was official handouts to the teachers.
[01:56:40.018 --> 01:56:44.401]  It said they're going to teach in primary Spanish to everyone!
[01:56:46.063 --> 01:56:47.043]  You understand?
[01:56:47.063 --> 01:56:50.826]  It said math, science, and English.
[01:56:51.447 --> 01:56:52.788]  And see, we should have done an article on this.
[01:56:52.808 --> 01:56:54.629]  It would have been really important and gotten out.
[01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:56.150]  But we can't do it all!
[01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:57.571]  I'm grounding in it!
[01:56:59.372 --> 01:57:03.115]  In Texas, in Austin, schools are going to speech in Spanish!
[01:57:04.136 --> 01:57:05.877]  I don't mean bilingual, baby!
[01:57:07.038 --> 01:57:08.059]  I mean Spanish!
[01:57:10.206 --> 01:57:15.171]  Similar ventures are underway in Yakima, Washington, San Diego, California, and Austin, Texas.
[01:57:15.851 --> 01:57:28.583]  Students come to us with such complex issues, said Tim King, director of Clackamas Middle School and Clackamas Web Agency Academy, with rival courses and virtual courses in Mexico's learning materials.
[01:57:29.744 --> 01:57:31.626]  And it says that they're going to speak Spanish.
[01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:38.905]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.925 --> 01:57:39.465]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.645 --> 01:57:40.506]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.546 --> 01:57:42.908]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.049 --> 01:57:47.212]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.721 --> 01:57:57.582]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.602 --> 01:58:01.885]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.465 --> 01:58:07.909]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.669 --> 01:58:12.072]  You see, I got real mad in the last segment for stations that are just joining us.
[01:58:13.432 --> 01:58:17.015]  Aaron Dykes works here in the office, the webmaster for JonesReport.com.
[01:58:17.055 --> 01:58:18.596]  He walks in, gives me an AP article.
[01:58:20.657 --> 01:58:25.761]  From East Texas to Central Texas to Northern California, all over the country,
[01:58:27.165 --> 01:58:42.268]  Eight Western states, they are going to only at the schools, and this is at mainline schools, at the school where Ritter's family, Chris Ritter I know gave me the documents, in East Texas, they said it's only like 10% Hispanic there, and most of them are Americans who speak English.
[01:58:42.288 --> 01:58:42.728]  It doesn't matter.
[01:58:42.988 --> 01:58:48.109]  They're going to teach science and math, which will further dumb everybody down because they won't be able to adopt it.
[01:58:48.649 --> 01:58:49.349]  It's before that.
[01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:51.389]  It's anything to screw education up, see?
[01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:55.210]  They're going to adopt Spanish only.
[01:58:56.738 --> 01:58:59.602]  Not just classes side-by-side where it's quote bilingual.
[01:59:00.743 --> 01:59:00.984]  No.
[01:59:04.008 --> 01:59:05.009]  Total Spanish.
[01:59:05.069 --> 01:59:06.811]  By the way, that's not in the AP article.
[01:59:07.612 --> 01:59:08.654]  And then see, I remember.
[01:59:09.294 --> 01:59:11.898]  Oh, I was given those official teacher handouts.
[01:59:11.938 --> 01:59:13.580]  I mean, these were the official internal stuff.
[01:59:14.136 --> 01:59:16.437]  That you will be speaking, you'll be teaching in Spanish.
[01:59:16.957 --> 01:59:22.378]  If you cannot teach science and English, uh, and, uh, what was the other one?
[01:59:22.638 --> 01:59:25.499]  It was English, science, and math in pure Spanish.
[01:59:25.519 --> 01:59:26.559]  We're now switching to Spanish.
[01:59:26.879 --> 01:59:28.039]  You will be fired.
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:33.881]  And that was last spring.
[01:59:34.671 --> 01:59:36.012]  And then now we're going into fall.
[01:59:36.132 --> 01:59:37.392]  So they were telling them for this year.
[01:59:37.692 --> 01:59:38.752]  So I need to get Ritter on.
[01:59:38.933 --> 01:59:42.194]  If I can't get a hold of her today, Chris Ritter, I'll get her in studio.
[01:59:42.214 --> 01:59:45.295]  See, that's the kind of gold mines of stuff we just missed.
[01:59:45.315 --> 01:59:49.536]  And by gold mine, we're here to expose the evil, expose the corruption, show you how bad it is.
[01:59:49.856 --> 01:59:54.618]  And people who think I exaggerate and the show isn't as bad as it says, it's worse, folks!
[01:59:55.447 --> 01:59:58.029]  People who think, I can never tell you how bad it is.
[01:59:58.449 --> 02:00:00.931]  I can never cover every facet of how bad it is.
[02:00:01.231 --> 02:00:04.613]  You cannot make this stuff up.
[02:00:08.636 --> 02:00:10.137]  You cannot make it up.
[02:00:11.237 --> 02:00:13.078]  Jason in California, then Richard and others.
[02:00:13.118 --> 02:00:13.739]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:00:18.130 --> 02:00:20.330]  It's an honor to be on your program.
[02:00:20.730 --> 02:00:23.491]  I just started listening to you just a few months ago.
[02:00:24.951 --> 02:00:30.992]  With this stuff that came out today, I just feel compelled to get on there and share in your frustration.
[02:00:31.052 --> 02:00:32.153]  I'm a UPS driver.
[02:00:32.173 --> 02:00:34.673]  Everywhere I go, people have the same
[02:00:38.883 --> 02:00:44.468]  You know, I am the sky as long as I got my Escalade and I got my drinks on Friday night type attitude.
[02:00:45.129 --> 02:00:48.052]  You know, they don't think anything's wrong and they don't think anything's coming.
[02:00:48.512 --> 02:00:52.536]  But I read a book by James Rawless titled The Coming Collapse.
[02:00:53.354 --> 02:00:57.860]  And I don't know if you have that up on your website or have ever had it up on your website.
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.945]  Well, but I mean, I've talked to, you know, scores of economists.
[02:01:01.005 --> 02:01:01.966]  It's well documented.
[02:01:02.186 --> 02:01:07.774]  Well, he wrote a novel and it's somewhat prophetic from the news that I woke up to today and then listening to you.
[02:01:09.941 --> 02:01:17.769]  You know, he chronicles this type of dollar collapse in our economy and then the chaos that ensues.
[02:01:17.849 --> 02:01:21.753]  You spoke earlier and said, hey, to the Mennonites, you guys need to arm up.
[02:01:21.853 --> 02:01:30.843]  Hey, all of your listeners need to be ready because it's coming and once it does happen, if they even allow it to happen, they might try to
[02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:38.537]  Overshadow it with, let's say, another 9-11 or nuke attack.
[02:01:38.577 --> 02:01:44.964]  Something to really skew the true reason behind why this great nation has fallen.
[02:01:47.387 --> 02:01:55.909]  And on top of that, you know, I think people need to get back into the Word of God and realize when they open up to Revelation 17 and see that, hey, Mystery Babylon?
[02:01:56.290 --> 02:01:57.050]  We're living in it.
[02:01:57.650 --> 02:01:59.310]  We are Mystery Babylon.
[02:01:59.390 --> 02:02:09.153]  Oh no, they think that Jesus is going to appear and that when Jesus arrives, that's not Antichrist, that's Jesus, which is exactly what the Bible says.
[02:02:09.213 --> 02:02:12.774]  These fake Christians, I mean, they're ready to bow down to Lucifer today!
[02:02:13.154 --> 02:02:15.115]  Yeah, and Ted just spoke on it earlier.
[02:02:15.155 --> 02:02:16.716]  When you had Ted on, I listened to him.
[02:02:16.736 --> 02:02:20.117]  He says, hey, we have sold our soul.
[02:02:20.197 --> 02:02:21.238]  And what have we sold it for?
[02:02:21.298 --> 02:02:23.639]  We've sold it for money and the greed thereof.
[02:02:23.999 --> 02:02:26.840]  And therefore, that's exactly what's chronicled in Revelation 17.
[02:02:27.501 --> 02:02:30.942]  Hey, it's an economic whoring of ourselves.
[02:02:31.442 --> 02:02:35.224]  And the American people have been buffooned and trapped and enslaved.
[02:02:35.844 --> 02:02:37.265]  And we're destined for doom.
[02:02:37.425 --> 02:02:39.326]  And people need to arm up and get ready
[02:02:39.607 --> 02:02:41.998]  I hear you.
[02:02:42.038 --> 02:02:43.404]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:02:43.424 --> 02:02:43.886]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.067 --> 02:02:46.808]  Terrorism!
[02:02:46.968 --> 02:02:47.708]  Terrorism!
[02:02:47.828 --> 02:02:53.892]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:02:54.152 --> 02:02:55.733]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:02:55.993 --> 02:02:58.475]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:02:58.855 --> 02:03:13.424]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:13.464 --> 02:03:13.784]  government.
[02:03:13.964 --> 02:03:15.745]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:03:16.125 --> 02:03:22.047]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:22.168 --> 02:03:26.669]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[02:03:26.929 --> 02:03:32.552]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:03:48.573 --> 02:03:49.033]  It's here!
[02:03:49.253 --> 02:03:54.034]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.394 --> 02:04:02.056]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.736 --> 02:04:09.777]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.178 --> 02:04:17.079]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:04:17.566 --> 02:04:21.629]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.910 --> 02:04:25.412]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.893 --> 02:04:27.814]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.135 --> 02:04:32.058]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.070 --> 02:04:53.297]  Hi, I'm David, and if you wake up at night to urinate like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk-free offer.
[02:04:53.517 --> 02:05:01.524]  If you have dribbling, burning, or pain during or after urination, then you may have a condition known as benign prostate enlargement.
[02:05:01.784 --> 02:05:04.467]  This is potentially serious and can get worse with age.
[02:05:04.867 --> 02:05:11.255]  So get regular checkups from your doctor and take advantage of this special risk-free offer on Beta Prostate.
[02:05:11.435 --> 02:05:15.981]  Beta Prostate contains natural ingredients that help support a healthy prostate.
[02:05:16.201 --> 02:05:21.628]  And it contains 3,000 times more beta-sinosterols than ordinary saw palmetto.
[02:05:21.888 --> 02:05:23.831]  So it's powerful and it works!
[02:05:24.211 --> 02:05:26.932]  What's better is that Beta Prostate is a healthy supplement.
[02:05:27.172 --> 02:05:28.812]  So you don't need a prescription for it.
[02:05:29.012 --> 02:05:29.872]  And it's risk free.

[02:05:34.473 --> 02:05:34.853]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[02:05:34.873 --> 02:05:35.213]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.642 --> 02:05:52.703]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.423 --> 02:05:54.523]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.184 --> 02:05:56.004]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.744 --> 02:05:58.665]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.685 --> 02:06:02.187]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.507 --> 02:06:06.589]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.019 --> 02:06:12.461]  Well, eight minutes into this third and final hour.
[02:06:12.561 --> 02:06:24.727]  I will be getting into the war news, the Ahmadinejad news, the dumping of the dollar news, the police state news, but let's go to a bunch of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:24.747 --> 02:06:29.290]  Namely, what do you think about checkpoints all over the country where the cops demand your blood?
[02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:30.671]  Just randomly.
[02:06:31.111 --> 02:06:35.053]  And then when they get in trouble about it, they just say, well, we don't make you, but they wouldn't let families leave.
[02:06:35.788 --> 02:06:38.490]  What do you think about Greenspan ordering the dollar to go down?
[02:06:38.530 --> 02:06:41.892]  He is the boss, along with the current Fed chief, saying it's going to go down.
[02:06:41.952 --> 02:06:42.552]  It plunges.
[02:06:42.892 --> 02:06:44.393]  The Saudis start dumping the dollar.
[02:06:44.793 --> 02:06:45.914]  The Venezuelans dump it.
[02:06:45.974 --> 02:06:46.834]  It's huge, folks.
[02:06:46.874 --> 02:06:50.536]  That's why you can still buy the Chinese slave goods that are so precious to you.
[02:06:51.597 --> 02:06:54.599]  And I guess so precious to me, with all the precious poison all over them.
[02:06:55.539 --> 02:06:59.462]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Tennessee, then Brian, Thomas, and others.
[02:06:59.482 --> 02:07:00.102]  Go ahead, Richard.
[02:07:02.231 --> 02:07:30.126]  I heard an audio tape about 10 years ago called Inside Satan's Locker Room and I knew there was a lot more to it than what was on that tape but never really got a chance to know about what was going on until somebody came up to me back in April of 06 and talking about the physics of 9-11 and why Jim Walter would put out a $500,000 reward for somebody to prove the government story of 9-11.
[02:07:31.658 --> 02:07:38.961]  And I just want to say that it's been a very interesting year for myself, listening to you and the GCN Network.
[02:07:40.402 --> 02:07:58.191]  But I was on 9-11 Blogger, either last week or the week before, and he had a poll on there talking about when did you start taking action and spreading 9-11 truth, and it showed that 2006 was the year most people started doing that.
[02:07:58.311 --> 02:08:00.912]  Well yeah, Charlie Sheen totally
[02:08:02.196 --> 02:08:08.977]  Turbocharged everything, because people resonated with the courage of somebody, an A-list star, going public.
[02:08:09.017 --> 02:08:12.638]  It wasn't because he'd been in movies, it was because they recognized the courage.
[02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:20.860]  And all the 9-11 sites, many of them sent me emails saying, my gosh, we've doubled and tripled our traffic, and all these people are waking up now.
[02:08:21.700 --> 02:08:26.441]  And I've told Charlie personally, I don't think he realizes the huge effect that his courage had.
[02:08:26.961 --> 02:08:31.242]  And since then, so many other celebrities have gone public, and in this sick culture, that means a lot to people.
[02:08:32.409 --> 02:08:36.312]  But it's certainly, it's an exponential wake up that's happening.
[02:08:36.572 --> 02:08:37.292]  And that's good!
[02:08:37.692 --> 02:08:46.257]  Now we've got to have an exponential wake up about how the central banks are orchestrating this credit collapse and the dollar collapse to consolidate.
[02:08:47.318 --> 02:08:48.779]  Because the average person isn't aware of it.
[02:08:48.799 --> 02:08:51.160]  I was going to ask you, what do you think?
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:53.581]  Has 9-11 Truth hit its peak?
[02:08:54.542 --> 02:08:55.763]  Or is there another climb?
[02:08:58.186 --> 02:08:58.867]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:08:58.887 --> 02:09:14.867]  9-11 Truth, I think, will hit its peak at the end of the next election cycle because they'll put new birdcage liner in, Hillary or whoever it is, I hope it's Ron Paul, but regardless, the machines behind Hillary and the Democrats, when they put her
[02:09:16.173 --> 02:09:26.806]  Or someone else in, then it'll kind of be, the media is already saying forget about 9-11, they're saying they're not going to use it for propaganda purposes anymore, even the New York Times is, because they know we've taken it away from them.
[02:09:27.287 --> 02:09:32.954]  But the key is now, false flag, inside job, the public now has that in there.
[02:09:34.691 --> 02:09:41.217]  In their definitions, in their lexicon, in their mind, people now know government stage attacks.
[02:09:41.577 --> 02:09:42.919]  People now have heard that.
[02:09:43.459 --> 02:09:49.885]  And so that means it's a lot harder for the globalists to stage more attacks, because each time they stage one, people don't buy it.
[02:09:50.125 --> 02:09:58.913]  The 7-7 got exposed within weeks, and PrisonPlanet.com, when you typed in London bombing, was the number one link, meaning it was getting the most visits.
[02:09:59.671 --> 02:10:07.297]  And so all of that is happening, and really taking one of their key tools out of their toolbox.
[02:10:08.378 --> 02:10:17.045]  But they've just moved on to economic manipulations, wars, expanded wars, but we've got to continue to expose government-sponsored terror.
[02:10:17.065 --> 02:10:21.588]  I mean, I was exposing it years before 9-11 because I was aware that was one of their key tools.
[02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:28.654]  I saw the major think tanks saying they were going to use terror to set up the New World Order, so I preemptively said,
[02:10:29.361 --> 02:10:31.022]  Government-sponsored terror is going to be the key.
[02:10:31.383 --> 02:10:38.288]  That's why I've been in position, even before it happened, as the leader of the 9-11 Truth Movement, though I never wanted to be that leader.
[02:10:39.089 --> 02:10:47.375]  But if a bunch of scum is going to try to take that mantle and try to destroy the movement, I've got to step in and say, no, you didn't start all this research.
[02:10:47.395 --> 02:10:48.276]  You didn't do this work.
[02:10:49.439 --> 02:11:00.887]  But it is one of many keys, one of four or five keys, and I think one of the most important keys in unlocking the New World Order and bringing it down.
[02:11:02.248 --> 02:11:14.155]  Well, just real quick, something I haven't heard talked very much about with RFID and the REAL ID Act is the fact of the health issues that it comes with, the frequency that it puts off.
[02:11:14.215 --> 02:11:18.378]  I've had my own personal challenges with my cell phone affecting my
[02:11:19.268 --> 02:11:24.611]  Uh, everyday life having headaches and inflammation in the face on the side that I use my phone.
[02:11:24.651 --> 02:11:26.072]  Well, why do you use it?
[02:11:27.333 --> 02:11:28.874]  Well, it's gotten a lot better.
[02:11:28.894 --> 02:11:31.835]  I went to a chiropractor and he changed a few things.
[02:11:33.036 --> 02:11:36.378]  Well, a chiropractor's not going to be able to block the radiation.
[02:11:36.938 --> 02:11:37.519]  Oh, yeah, sure.
[02:11:37.559 --> 02:11:38.319]  I understand that.
[02:11:38.379 --> 02:11:42.442]  I have a headset that has an air tube at the top of it.
[02:11:42.662 --> 02:11:44.463]  I've taken precautions.
[02:11:44.483 --> 02:11:45.904]  I don't put it on my head anymore.
[02:11:45.964 --> 02:11:47.645]  I use speakerphone if I don't have my...
[02:11:49.375 --> 02:11:50.456]  Regardless, we've got to move fast.
[02:11:50.476 --> 02:11:55.277]  I was just asking about the effect of RFID.
[02:11:55.337 --> 02:11:57.958]  I know that the chips have been found to cause cancer.
[02:11:58.318 --> 02:12:03.820]  Just didn't know if anybody's come out about the... Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:12:03.960 --> 02:12:05.620]  Yeah, I mean, of course.
[02:12:05.801 --> 02:12:06.721]  It's not good for you.
[02:12:07.961 --> 02:12:16.344]  And the chips have that toxic substance on them that binds to your tissue, so it doesn't move around and migrate, and so it's causing problems.
[02:12:17.190 --> 02:12:19.151]  That's nothing compared to drinking tap water, folks.
[02:12:19.171 --> 02:12:20.071]  Just having tap water.
[02:12:20.571 --> 02:12:24.733]  That's why bladder and kidney cancer is off the charts.
[02:12:24.813 --> 02:12:26.173]  It's just what killed Aaron Russo.
[02:12:26.953 --> 02:12:28.954]  I mean, it's just, we're getting poisoned from every angle.
[02:12:30.234 --> 02:12:31.335]  Okay, let's go to another call.
[02:12:31.375 --> 02:12:32.195]  I appreciate your calls, sir.
[02:12:32.215 --> 02:12:33.035]  I've just got to get going.
[02:12:33.055 --> 02:12:33.836]  I won't get to anybody.
[02:12:34.676 --> 02:12:36.417]  Let's talk to Brian in California.
[02:12:36.437 --> 02:12:36.977]  You're on the air.
[02:12:37.037 --> 02:12:37.437]  Go ahead.
[02:12:38.257 --> 02:12:39.138]  Hey, Alex.
[02:12:39.198 --> 02:12:41.178]  I'll be real fast, and I'll get off the phone and listen to you.
[02:12:41.658 --> 02:12:42.639]  Calling from Canada.
[02:12:42.659 --> 02:12:46.140]  The last probably ten years, we've been paying down our debt up here.
[02:12:47.126 --> 02:12:50.329]  And as you know, our dollar has really risen against the American dollar.
[02:12:50.369 --> 02:12:54.311]  Now, do we have the same concerns about our dollar going to hell like the American dollar?
[02:12:54.391 --> 02:12:55.953]  Should we be looking at gold also?
[02:12:57.157 --> 02:12:59.638]  Are we going to be able to ride through this a little bit easier?
[02:12:59.818 --> 02:13:02.998]  They're going to run credit bubbles and bursts everywhere.
[02:13:03.018 --> 02:13:04.219]  They've already done it in Asia.
[02:13:04.239 --> 02:13:05.399]  They've already done it in Japan.
[02:13:05.419 --> 02:13:13.521]  The big central banks are going to do it to blow out all the small banks and consolidate them and to bankrupt the general population and get you in further debt.
[02:13:14.101 --> 02:13:18.022]  Your Federal Reserve was set up the same year our Federal Reserve was set up in 1913.
[02:13:18.382 --> 02:13:20.163]  It's owned by the very same Bank of England.
[02:13:20.543 --> 02:13:21.743]  They're just bringing the U.S.
[02:13:21.783 --> 02:13:22.003]  down.
[02:13:22.063 --> 02:13:24.404]  But I would say that in the next ten years they'll bring down your
[02:13:26.861 --> 02:13:27.602]  Currency as well.
[02:13:27.662 --> 02:13:31.264]  What, the Mooney just hit parity and just went above the dollar yesterday?
[02:13:31.284 --> 02:13:34.106]  Or the Looney, what do you call your currency?
[02:13:36.008 --> 02:13:37.829]  Okay, I didn't let him go, he just dropped.
[02:13:41.198 --> 02:13:44.920]  You know, they always tell you that you're dead, and paying it off, and the national debt.
[02:13:45.160 --> 02:13:45.840]  It's fiat!
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:57.965]  These banks issue out of, they go pay off your politicians, the politician signs a fraudulent deal, saying that the, so the government can issue currency, we'll pay interest to a private bank for the right to do it.
[02:13:58.285 --> 02:13:59.286]  It's total fraud!
[02:13:59.306 --> 02:14:02.407]  I don't know how to explain this to people.
[02:14:03.388 --> 02:14:04.228]  It isn't even real!
[02:14:07.057 --> 02:14:11.618]  But those cops that'll come with machine guns if you don't hand your house over when you go bankrupt are real.
[02:14:12.359 --> 02:14:13.479]  It's all about the real world.
[02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:15.380]  It's a total scam.
[02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:16.540]  They're total hucksters.
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:18.561]  It's all paper.
[02:14:18.661 --> 02:14:19.441]  It means nothing.
[02:14:19.721 --> 02:14:20.981]  And they get the world for it.
[02:14:21.782 --> 02:14:28.844]  And we gave them total control and we love the Federal Reserve and we thought they were making our day when in truth we already have record
[02:14:29.855 --> 02:14:30.656]  Private debt.
[02:14:30.736 --> 02:14:35.700]  We have higher debt ratio in January of this year, and it's been growing, than at the depths of the Depression.
[02:14:35.860 --> 02:14:37.421]  And they call this milk and honey.
[02:14:37.701 --> 02:14:40.344]  As bad as things are, people still think this is milk and honey.
[02:14:43.206 --> 02:14:45.528]  But you're now completely at their will.
[02:14:46.469 --> 02:14:48.490]  You're now completely under their control.
[02:14:48.890 --> 02:14:50.372]  And now they can have their way with you.
[02:14:51.473 --> 02:14:56.837]  Now they can make Spanish only in major schools from Austin to Portland, Oregon.
[02:14:57.879 --> 02:14:59.440]  They can now completely get rid of the border.
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:01.282]  They can now force inoculations on you.
[02:15:01.502 --> 02:15:03.304]  They can now have checkpoints and take your blood.
[02:15:03.984 --> 02:15:06.807]  They can now taser you for no reason, if you don't answer questions.
[02:15:07.147 --> 02:15:08.068]  Torture you publicly.
[02:15:08.308 --> 02:15:10.630]  See, because they can, because they got guns.
[02:15:14.693 --> 02:15:16.615]  Thomas in Kansas, you're on the air, welcome.
[02:15:18.355 --> 02:15:19.195]  God bless, man.
[02:15:19.635 --> 02:15:19.915]  Hello.
[02:15:20.496 --> 02:15:21.296]  Yeah, Alex, you there?
[02:15:21.536 --> 02:15:22.016]  Yes, I'm here.
[02:15:22.056 --> 02:15:22.276]  Hello.
[02:15:22.336 --> 02:15:23.156]  All right, man.
[02:15:23.376 --> 02:15:36.339]  I don't know if anybody's talked about it yet, but they had a Fed hearing about an hour ago on CNBC, and Ron Paul was on there, and he was just blasting Ben Bernanke.
[02:15:36.499 --> 02:15:47.121]  I mean, he basically came out and said, he's like, why are you and the Fed, you know, purposely decreasing the value of our currency?
[02:15:48.095 --> 02:15:55.703]  And Ben Bernanke just totally spun the whole thing around and made it, you know, act like he didn't know what Ron Paul was talking about.
[02:15:55.783 --> 02:16:01.830]  And by the way, when Greenspan Sunday gave a 60 Minutes interview, he said, oh, guess what?
[02:16:04.915 --> 02:16:06.716]  I lied to Congress all those times.
[02:16:06.856 --> 02:16:07.696]  Aren't I cute?
[02:16:08.376 --> 02:16:13.058]  So Ron Paul hit him with the fact that they're purposefully trying to accelerate dollar devaluation?
[02:16:13.338 --> 02:16:14.218]  Oh my, oh my God!
[02:16:14.278 --> 02:16:15.499]  It was like, it was unbelievable!
[02:16:15.559 --> 02:16:21.461]  I mean, and then, you know, you got, you got joke, you know, people that are like Barney Frank don't even know what they're talking about.
[02:16:22.210 --> 02:16:27.315]  You know, it's like Ron Paul's like the only guy on the... Well I guarantee you within hours that's going to be up on YouTube.
[02:16:27.635 --> 02:16:36.583]  I'm going to make sure that Aaron Dykes does a blurb on that Ron Paul, you know, grills or schools Bernanke or Ron Paul exposes how the Fed's destroying the currency by design.
[02:16:36.823 --> 02:16:41.528]  We wrote that article Monday about Greenspan tries to destroy U.S.
[02:16:41.548 --> 02:16:42.028]  economy.
[02:16:42.088 --> 02:16:42.869]  He's doing it.
[02:16:43.593 --> 02:16:44.475]  God bless Ron Paul.
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:03.403]  You know, kind of put Bernanke in his place, because there's no way they can spin it.
[02:17:03.723 --> 02:17:05.344]  Yeah, that analyst is going to get in trouble, though.
[02:17:05.364 --> 02:17:10.308]  See, that's an analyst who actually is smart, and doesn't want their children's future destroyed.
[02:17:10.648 --> 02:17:11.308]  Forget children!
[02:17:11.328 --> 02:17:12.229]  It's going to happen now!
[02:17:12.489 --> 02:17:26.458]  Yeah, I mean, it's unbelievable, because ten minutes later, you know, they said, well, you know, there's a new article out, or some article out with the Associated Press or whatnot, but saying that, I think it was DuBois was going to buy like 20 or 30% of the NASDAQ.
[02:17:28.470 --> 02:17:30.333]  You know, and then Bush is going to go along with it?
[02:17:31.474 --> 02:17:31.895]  Well, yeah.
[02:17:31.935 --> 02:17:34.919]  Why do you think, uh, they bought homes over there?
[02:17:35.019 --> 02:17:35.940]  They're leaving America.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:37.642]  America's... It's a matter of national security.
[02:17:37.662 --> 02:17:38.643]  What is going on?
[02:17:39.044 --> 02:17:39.424]  Totals?
[02:17:39.485 --> 02:17:42.428]  Hey, they got bin Laden sock puppets to scare you with.
[02:17:42.849 --> 02:17:44.751]  Who cares if it's a real national security crisis?
[02:17:44.772 --> 02:17:45.092]  Stay there.
[02:17:45.112 --> 02:17:45.753]  I'll let you finish up.
[02:17:47.771 --> 02:17:59.018]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:17:59.238 --> 02:18:05.702]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:18:05.942 --> 02:18:06.543]  We're good to go!
[02:18:31.126 --> 02:18:33.108]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[02:18:33.168 --> 02:18:33.809]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.849 --> 02:18:34.169]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.229 --> 02:18:35.751]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:35.791 --> 02:18:36.751]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:45.859 --> 02:18:48.120]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[02:18:48.500 --> 02:18:58.484]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[02:18:58.985 --> 02:19:04.527]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[02:19:04.567 --> 02:19:11.250]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[02:19:11.750 --> 02:19:13.771]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[02:19:14.716 --> 02:19:21.823]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[02:19:22.183 --> 02:19:27.989]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle-class citizens and discouraging savings.
[02:19:28.550 --> 02:19:33.034]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[02:19:33.054 --> 02:19:36.017]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[02:19:36.477 --> 02:19:38.098]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:38.178 --> 02:19:38.378]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[02:19:46.182 --> 02:19:48.023]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:19:48.163 --> 02:19:53.346]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:19:53.526 --> 02:19:54.867]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:19:55.147 --> 02:20:03.311]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:20:03.531 --> 02:20:09.254]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:20:09.414 --> 02:20:11.196]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:20:11.276 --> 02:20:13.438]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:20:13.458 --> 02:20:17.822]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:20:17.982 --> 02:20:20.164]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:20:20.224 --> 02:20:27.010]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio best.
[02:20:29.377 --> 02:20:29.917]  We're good to go.
[02:20:52.396 --> 02:20:52.637]  Hemp.
[02:20:53.057 --> 02:20:55.820]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[02:20:56.181 --> 02:20:56.461]  Hemp.
[02:20:56.801 --> 02:21:03.289]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[02:21:03.629 --> 02:21:06.873]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[02:21:07.153 --> 02:21:10.758]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[02:21:11.318 --> 02:21:15.642]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[02:21:16.003 --> 02:21:22.428]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[02:21:22.749 --> 02:21:27.033]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[02:21:27.273 --> 02:21:29.135]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[02:21:39.464 --> 02:21:40.525]  We do not charge for shipping.

[02:22:05.766 --> 02:22:07.407]  Rick in Cleveland, you're on the air.
[02:22:07.467 --> 02:22:08.188]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:08.388 --> 02:22:08.748]  Welcome.
[02:22:10.730 --> 02:22:11.470]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:22:12.951 --> 02:22:13.131]  Hello?
[02:22:13.832 --> 02:22:16.254]  Yeah, when I go to you and I say you're on the air, it means you're on the air.
[02:22:16.274 --> 02:22:16.834]  Okay, thank you.
[02:22:16.854 --> 02:22:17.835]  And I'm not mad at the callers.
[02:22:17.855 --> 02:22:19.436]  Everybody goes, hello, hello, hello.
[02:22:19.896 --> 02:22:20.857]  Yes, sir, you're on the air.
[02:22:21.077 --> 02:22:22.378]  Uh, first time listener in a long time.
[02:22:22.418 --> 02:22:23.599]  In fact, I'm just mad about the country.
[02:22:23.619 --> 02:22:24.139]  Put them on hold.
[02:22:24.199 --> 02:22:24.940]  I just can't handle it.
[02:22:25.555 --> 02:22:26.355]  I just can't handle it.
[02:22:26.456 --> 02:22:28.617]  They're killing the country right now.
[02:22:29.257 --> 02:22:32.419]  They're killing the country right now in front of everyone.
[02:22:32.759 --> 02:22:39.102]  They are destroying the dollar by design, on purpose, by the rate cut and announcing it was going to go down before that.
[02:22:39.122 --> 02:22:40.883]  This is all we had left.
[02:22:41.344 --> 02:22:42.884]  And I'm not trying to be mean to you, Rick.
[02:22:42.924 --> 02:22:45.046]  I forgot that I was supposed to go back to Thomas.
[02:22:45.806 --> 02:22:47.887]  But we should be able to even take phone calls!
[02:22:47.927 --> 02:22:49.408]  It's like we're all retarded now!
[02:22:49.428 --> 02:22:52.049]  It's just, we're pathetic!
[02:22:52.089 --> 02:22:53.210]  The whole country's shot!
[02:22:54.130 --> 02:22:55.111]  Alright, I'm not going to get mad.
[02:22:55.271 --> 02:22:56.071]  I'm not going to get mad.
[02:22:56.191 --> 02:22:56.931]  I'm not going to get mad.
[02:22:57.512 --> 02:22:58.312]  Is Thomas still there?
[02:22:58.332 --> 02:22:59.893]  I said I was going to go back to him, then we'll go to Rick.
[02:23:00.773 --> 02:23:02.815]  Okay, Thomas, finish up what you were going to say, then I'll go to Rick.
[02:23:04.415 --> 02:23:04.896]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:23:05.116 --> 02:23:06.016]  Yeah, go ahead and finish up!
[02:23:06.036 --> 02:23:06.837]  FINISH UP!
[02:23:07.077 --> 02:23:07.817]  I'm finishing, buddy.
[02:23:07.877 --> 02:23:08.377]  I'm finishing.
[02:23:08.397 --> 02:23:09.458]  Alright, here's the deal.
[02:23:09.478 --> 02:23:12.680]  Alright, I'm sitting here watching CNBC, okay?
[02:23:13.740 --> 02:23:17.142]  And, you know, nobody asks the question, why?
[02:23:17.582 --> 02:23:19.003]  Where does the Fed get this money?
[02:23:19.123 --> 02:23:20.584]  They just assume we all know
[02:23:21.480 --> 02:23:25.803]  That the state is stealing from all the American people, and I want my money!
[02:23:26.363 --> 02:23:27.164]  I want my money!
[02:23:27.764 --> 02:23:28.025]  You know?
[02:23:28.045 --> 02:23:34.589]  I think I speak for you and everybody else across the nation, that they're stealing from all of us!
[02:23:35.029 --> 02:23:35.309]  You know?
[02:23:36.210 --> 02:23:42.234]  Well, that's why I've got to apologize to you, and I've got to apologize to Rick, who I'm about to go back to, and then Joe.
[02:23:42.554 --> 02:23:46.117]  I'm not mad at you individually, and I'm not even a lover of money.
[02:23:47.213 --> 02:24:05.652]  But literally, this is how we buy our groceries, it's how we pay our mortgages, it's how we pay for our cars, and to watch them literally steal 60 plus percent now of the value, and notice it's like another 10 percent in the last few weeks, folks, it's accelerating, and to see it makes me violently angry.
[02:24:05.712 --> 02:24:06.713]  I'm glad you're mad!
[02:24:06.913 --> 02:24:10.517]  This is literally like coming in your house and grabbing your wallet!
[02:24:11.172 --> 02:24:11.612]  Go ahead!
[02:24:11.772 --> 02:24:13.614]  You know, I've got my AR-15 loaded!
[02:24:13.794 --> 02:24:14.354]  I'm ready!
[02:24:14.394 --> 02:24:17.236]  But the thing of it is, you know, I want my justice!
[02:24:17.596 --> 02:24:17.896]  You know?
[02:24:17.916 --> 02:24:23.280]  I mean, our freedoms are getting taken away from us, our money's getting taken away from us, it's like, what's next?
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:24.781]  You know, our spirit?
[02:24:25.301 --> 02:24:26.062]  You know, our soul?
[02:24:26.362 --> 02:24:28.383]  Well, that's what they do with these vaccines and the rest of it.
[02:24:28.423 --> 02:24:29.164]  I appreciate your call.
[02:24:29.184 --> 02:24:31.125]  Look, I'm gonna try to be calm and not angry about this.
[02:24:31.804 --> 02:24:32.945]  But we should be mad.
[02:24:32.965 --> 02:24:33.866]  Alright, Rick, I'm sorry.
[02:24:33.886 --> 02:24:34.667]  I got out of order there.
[02:24:34.707 --> 02:24:36.108]  That's why I put you on hold in Cleveland.
[02:24:36.528 --> 02:24:37.569]  I'm sorry for being rude to you.
[02:24:37.589 --> 02:24:37.849]  Go ahead.
[02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:38.670]  You've got the floor, Rick.
[02:24:39.050 --> 02:24:41.272]  Yeah, first-time listener, long-time believer.
[02:24:42.173 --> 02:24:49.820]  I'm just wondering, in order for this to fail, we kind of need to know who in the government at some of the higher positions we can trust.
[02:24:52.243 --> 02:24:55.684]  Only Ron Paul and maybe 10 other congressmen and women.
[02:24:55.724 --> 02:24:57.405]  The rest are all new or older scum.
[02:24:57.445 --> 02:25:01.826]  Republican, Democrat, they're all destroying America by design and bragging about it.
[02:25:02.126 --> 02:25:03.346]  That includes judges too?
[02:25:04.406 --> 02:25:10.268]  Oh yeah, these federal judges are just absolutely bought and paid for by foreign interests.
[02:25:10.408 --> 02:25:11.228]  Total criminals.
[02:25:11.868 --> 02:25:15.849]  I mean, that doesn't mean all your county, city, state judges, but a lot of them are crooks.
[02:25:16.551 --> 02:25:18.492]  I mean, it's just the government's completely criminal, sir.
[02:25:18.972 --> 02:25:34.498]  Okay, and as far as when they do finally play their trump card, I think by then, you'll have people that may be ready as individuals, but I think that disorganization might kind of set us back.
[02:25:35.098 --> 02:25:35.458]  I agree!
[02:25:35.498 --> 02:25:38.159]  Hey, listen, and listen, I'm just talking about what the new order's doing.
[02:25:38.479 --> 02:25:40.720]  I don't even claim to have all the solutions or all the answers.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:42.801]  I just know a pack of criminals is running everything.
[02:25:43.675 --> 02:25:46.864]  Do you know of any organizations that...
[02:25:50.154 --> 02:25:55.795]  They can tell us how to organize or... No, we've gotten in this trouble because we're always looking for someone to tell us what to do.
[02:25:56.215 --> 02:25:59.416]  Go back to the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence.
[02:25:59.796 --> 02:26:01.236]  Go off what Ron Paul's saying.
[02:26:01.276 --> 02:26:05.477]  We've gotten in this position by letting foreign interests completely get control of us.
[02:26:05.957 --> 02:26:08.318]  They want to blow out the economy to consolidate things.
[02:26:08.498 --> 02:26:10.178]  No one group's going to save us.
[02:26:10.798 --> 02:26:15.679]  It's going to be educating police, military, the general public about who their enemy is.
[02:26:15.919 --> 02:26:19.900]  And their enemy is the Federal Reserve, the private banks, the New World Order that owns this country.
[02:26:20.751 --> 02:26:22.191]  But none of those people want to believe that.
[02:26:22.592 --> 02:26:24.492]  They just want to collect their paychecks.
[02:26:24.692 --> 02:26:26.513]  Well, they're going to find out, you see.
[02:26:28.333 --> 02:26:31.554]  You know, they don't want to believe until their kid gets beat up by the cops.
[02:26:31.774 --> 02:26:35.815]  They don't want to believe Mercury's bad in the shots until their son becomes brain damaged.
[02:26:36.135 --> 02:26:41.357]  They don't want to believe until they find out that their whole pension fund's been made worthless.
[02:26:42.277 --> 02:26:43.098]  You understand that, sir?
[02:26:45.208 --> 02:26:51.149]  I'm just afraid that these people will not have a conscience when our government tells them to go to war against the American citizens.
[02:26:51.529 --> 02:26:52.690]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[02:26:53.150 --> 02:26:53.770]  Absolutely.
[02:26:53.810 --> 02:26:59.491]  We are the most wicked, pot-bellied, decadent, dumb people the world's ever seen.
[02:26:59.891 --> 02:27:08.193]  We had the most money, the most wealth, because we were a good, strong Christian nation that followed and was hard-working and fiercely independent.
[02:27:08.693 --> 02:27:14.694]  And then our grandparents became decadent, our parents became even more slovenly, and we're now like pig-demon people.
[02:27:15.254 --> 02:27:25.519]  I mean, we're just a bunch of decadent, stupid sloths with a bunch of wolves running all around us with sharp fangs and gleaming eyes and stuff's gonna get real serious before it all fleshes out.
[02:27:26.239 --> 02:27:27.940]  You want to live in the Soviet Union?
[02:27:27.960 --> 02:27:29.481]  You want to live in Nazi Germany?
[02:27:29.961 --> 02:27:31.101]  You want to be slaves?
[02:27:31.462 --> 02:27:32.442]  Well, you wanted it?
[02:27:32.702 --> 02:27:34.463]  Looks like you're gonna get it.
[02:27:34.923 --> 02:27:35.884]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.584 --> 02:27:37.544]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.984 --> 02:27:39.605]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.506 --> 02:27:43.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.423 --> 02:27:49.365]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:27:49.505 --> 02:27:54.689]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:27:55.029 --> 02:28:00.313]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:00.753 --> 02:28:01.874]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:28:02.234 --> 02:28:11.100]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:28:11.540 --> 02:28:13.162]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.
[02:28:13.382 --> 02:28:17.567]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[02:28:17.607 --> 02:28:22.232]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[02:28:22.613 --> 02:28:24.715]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[02:28:26.457 --> 02:28:27.238]  Keep it natural.
[02:28:27.518 --> 02:28:35.687]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.

[02:28:40.132 --> 02:28:41.193]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[02:28:46.181 --> 02:28:47.723]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[02:28:48.004 --> 02:28:53.532]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[02:28:53.992 --> 02:29:01.924]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[02:29:02.424 --> 02:29:03.024]  We're good to go.
[02:29:25.974 --> 02:29:30.620]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:34.645]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[02:29:34.685 --> 02:29:36.467]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[02:29:45.515 --> 02:29:50.459]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:29:50.779 --> 02:29:52.661]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:29:52.861 --> 02:29:55.903]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:29:56.083 --> 02:29:59.226]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:29:59.526 --> 02:30:01.408]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:30:01.648 --> 02:30:05.371]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:30:05.651 --> 02:30:08.293]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:30:08.613 --> 02:30:13.194]  Second Peter says, we have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[02:30:13.394 --> 02:30:17.696]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[02:30:18.096 --> 02:30:22.437]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[02:30:22.737 --> 02:30:26.978]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:30:27.318 --> 02:30:29.959]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy.
[02:30:30.219 --> 02:30:33.201]  Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more.
[02:30:33.482 --> 02:30:35.923]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:30:36.124 --> 02:30:36.844]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:30:36.884 --> 02:30:37.144]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:30:37.184 --> 02:30:39.006]  And ask for Packet B. Come, you masters of war.
[02:30:39.046 --> 02:30:40.587]  Here to build the big guns.
[02:30:57.913 --> 02:31:00.294]  Yeah, they build their planes.
[02:31:02.214 --> 02:31:04.175]  Yeah, they build all their bombs.
[02:31:06.575 --> 02:31:09.036]  Yeah, they hide behind walls.
[02:31:10.896 --> 02:31:12.857]  Yeah, they hide behind desks.
[02:31:15.137 --> 02:31:19.218]  I just want you to know I can see through your masks.
[02:31:21.699 --> 02:31:23.539]  You that never done nothing.
[02:31:33.823 --> 02:31:39.393]  What the new homeowner does is while they rape us, while they destroy the borders, the sovereignty, the culture, the dollar...
[02:31:40.799 --> 02:31:46.802]  They have their little boogeyman to keep you all focused and behind what the government's doing, but it isn't working anymore.
[02:31:47.362 --> 02:31:49.403]  Congress did have a 12% approval rating.
[02:31:49.443 --> 02:31:53.545]  It's now dropped to worse than the all-time record before, to below it.
[02:31:54.125 --> 02:32:00.948]  10 points for Congress in a Gallup poll, which normally is pro-government.
[02:32:00.968 --> 02:32:01.989]  10% approve of Congress.
[02:32:02.709 --> 02:32:06.251]  Now 25% still approve of Bush, because that's because they're hardcore neocons.
[02:32:06.931 --> 02:32:08.632]  But they don't approve of the way the country's going.
[02:32:09.887 --> 02:32:15.288]  You see, they've always had one party fooling the rest of the public, one party in favor, one party out of favor.
[02:32:15.328 --> 02:32:17.089]  Now it's all shot, you criminals.
[02:32:17.709 --> 02:32:19.330]  So now they want to go the Stasi route.
[02:32:21.310 --> 02:32:28.252]  They want to incrementally crank up the police state, the secret arrest, the taserings, the deaths, the killings, the brainwashing of the cops to do it.
[02:32:28.972 --> 02:32:29.792]  And it isn't going to work.
[02:32:29.892 --> 02:32:33.093]  I'm telling you, this is not Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany.
[02:32:33.433 --> 02:32:36.014]  It's going to be bad, but in the end, it's all going to collapse.
[02:32:40.330 --> 02:32:42.612]  And it's hard to believe that it came down to this.
[02:32:42.712 --> 02:32:43.473]  It's hard to believe.
[02:32:44.233 --> 02:32:50.778]  But the number one message we've got to be getting out right now is that the central bankers are behind this, just like Ron Paul today.
[02:32:51.099 --> 02:32:52.860]  I've now gotten a couple calls on it confirming it.
[02:32:53.280 --> 02:32:59.545]  Just a few hours ago, tore into Edward Bernanke, the head of the Federal Reserve, saying, why are you orchestrating the dollar's plunge?
[02:32:59.586 --> 02:33:01.407]  Why are you saying things that drive it down?
[02:33:01.767 --> 02:33:02.968]  Why are you trying to tank it?
[02:33:03.429 --> 02:33:05.310]  I mean, that is so evil, folks.
[02:33:06.111 --> 02:33:08.833]  Let me just give it to the yuppies and everybody else listening, simply.
[02:33:12.248 --> 02:33:17.770]  In the last nine months, 20% of the value of your dollar has been taken.
[02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:22.252]  40% was taken in the years before that.
[02:33:23.593 --> 02:33:24.993]  Do you see how it's accelerating?
[02:33:25.013 --> 02:33:26.954]  Do you understand what that means?
[02:33:28.295 --> 02:33:30.395]  I know you're not as stupid as you act.
[02:33:31.456 --> 02:33:34.017]  I'm not that smart, and I understand this.
[02:33:34.057 --> 02:33:36.338]  This is very easy.
[02:33:38.004 --> 02:33:49.149]  Do you understand they want to hurt the economy so that it goes belly up, so everybody goes bankrupt, including large corporations, so they can consolidate because they're still going to have the power to issue credit and print money.
[02:33:51.870 --> 02:33:53.190]  It's very bad.
[02:33:53.510 --> 02:33:55.191]  It's literal bank robbery.
[02:33:55.231 --> 02:33:56.372]  You're being robbed.
[02:33:57.372 --> 02:33:58.573]  Do you understand that?
[02:33:59.433 --> 02:34:01.414]  This is very serious.
[02:34:01.454 --> 02:34:05.675]  I've been talking about this for 12 years, how they were engineering and gearing up for it.
[02:34:05.715 --> 02:34:06.796]  They're doing it now.
[02:34:09.671 --> 02:34:21.715]  I mean, we were so in debt before, and the currency had already been devalued by 94% of its previous value, and 96% up until a couple years ago.
[02:34:21.735 --> 02:34:25.296]  Now, 99 plus percent devaluation of the dollar.
[02:34:25.756 --> 02:34:27.097]  You're going, well, wait a minute, you just said 60%.
[02:34:27.137 --> 02:34:28.857]  60.18% against the Euro since it opened in 2000.
[02:34:34.588 --> 02:34:42.094]  Since the dollar was taken over in 1913, it is a 99% change.
[02:34:43.375 --> 02:34:45.997]  Mainstream news says 96% devaluation.
[02:34:46.478 --> 02:34:47.378]  That's old numbers.
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:50.261]  I mean, do you like that?
[02:34:50.701 --> 02:34:51.802]  Does that make you happy?
[02:34:53.149 --> 02:35:07.114]  Man, when these yuppies who literally worship money, that's probably why they can't admit it to themselves, because if they admitted to themselves that the stock market was a fraud, and that it was really inflated, so that they actually lost much of their value, they couldn't handle it.
[02:35:08.354 --> 02:35:09.395]  I guess it's just procrastination.
[02:35:09.415 --> 02:35:13.196]  It's kind of like when you go to the doctor and they say, you have a giant brain tumor, you'll be dead in one month.
[02:35:14.136 --> 02:35:15.357]  And you just go, I don't have cancer!
[02:35:15.417 --> 02:35:15.557]  Talk!
[02:35:19.838 --> 02:35:22.399]  And so, again, earlier I was apologizing for the third time.
[02:35:22.479 --> 02:35:24.740]  I don't mean to get... I'm not kidding, folks.
[02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:28.182]  I almost picked the microphone up and smashed it on the desk in front of me.
[02:35:28.522 --> 02:35:29.922]  I almost overturned the desk.
[02:35:30.163 --> 02:35:32.604]  And I'm not... I haven't done... acted like that since I was a teenager.
[02:35:35.985 --> 02:35:37.966]  I mean, I, growing up, had a problem with temper.
[02:35:38.226 --> 02:35:40.407]  And I am literally violently angry right now.
[02:35:40.607 --> 02:35:42.688]  Violently angry.
[02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:46.810]  I mean, I am...
[02:35:47.674 --> 02:35:48.515]  Really mad right now.
[02:35:48.595 --> 02:35:50.096]  I probably shouldn't even be on air right now.
[02:35:50.516 --> 02:35:52.317]  I'm on the edge of blowing up right now.
[02:35:55.099 --> 02:35:58.022]  Because I can consciously see what they've done to us.
[02:35:59.623 --> 02:36:01.484]  And believe me, it's normal to be mad!
[02:36:07.048 --> 02:36:12.332]  By the time they're done with it, they'll blame it on the American people, when we do deserve some of the blame for letting them con us, but they're the people doing it.
[02:36:13.576 --> 02:36:14.456]  I mean, who's bad?
[02:36:14.516 --> 02:36:17.318]  The idiot woman that gets in the car with Ted Bundy or Ted Bundy?
[02:36:17.518 --> 02:36:19.319]  We're like the idiot woman that gets in the car.
[02:36:19.399 --> 02:36:21.079]  So you can go torturous.
[02:36:22.120 --> 02:36:23.921]  But we're not, we're not the bad guys.
[02:36:23.961 --> 02:36:24.861]  We're just the idiots.
[02:36:28.102 --> 02:36:33.965]  Alright, I want to go to your calls and I said I got loaded phones and I got all this war news and all this stuff I haven't gotten to yet.
[02:36:36.266 --> 02:36:39.788]  And I don't like blowing up anymore because I get really tired after I blow up.
[02:36:43.917 --> 02:36:45.438]  To watch them kill this country.
[02:36:45.478 --> 02:36:47.019]  They're actually destroying it.
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:48.961]  That's not a figure of speech, folks.
[02:36:49.261 --> 02:36:52.743]  I mean, this is big to have the Saudis and the Venezuelans.
[02:36:53.064 --> 02:36:54.445]  They are big players.
[02:36:56.346 --> 02:36:59.628]  And they already have the red herring out that it's Iran duffing that's causing it.
[02:36:59.728 --> 02:37:01.209]  Iran has nothing to do with this.
[02:37:02.490 --> 02:37:05.392]  It's the scum that runs this country that has everything to do with it.
[02:37:06.013 --> 02:37:07.834]  But you can't tell a neocon that.
[02:37:07.874 --> 02:37:09.095]  They just won't listen.
[02:37:13.562 --> 02:37:14.643]  Alright, I got a couple sponsors.
[02:37:14.683 --> 02:37:16.804]  I'm going to plug them here briefly, and then I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:37:17.244 --> 02:37:18.505]  One of them is Newswatch Magazine.
[02:37:18.945 --> 02:37:20.085]  What do I say about this?
[02:37:22.066 --> 02:37:24.748]  It's a big, glossy, thick, nice magazine.
[02:37:25.148 --> 02:37:26.789]  Been published since 1980.
[02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:30.791]  Woke up my uncle, who woke me up to a great extent.
[02:37:30.811 --> 02:37:33.732]  I already knew a lot of history, but my uncle did help push me along.
[02:37:36.774 --> 02:37:38.655]  And it's based right here in Texas, and it's free.
[02:37:38.875 --> 02:37:41.416]  I guess, you know, they got a few advertisements for the great books and videos.
[02:37:42.276 --> 02:37:48.964]  Pastor David J. Schmidt has put together, and that's how they pay for it, you know, hoping you'll buy a few things out of there, but it's just they want you to have the material.
[02:37:49.625 --> 02:37:56.313]  It's a free, glossy magazine, and they just call and take your name and number and send it to you.
[02:37:58.485 --> 02:38:00.406]  And you need to give them a call today.
[02:38:00.686 --> 02:38:11.629]  And even if you already know all this stuff, your cousin, your neighbor, your boss doesn't, get a year's subscription of these and when the 12 issues come, lay them out at work on the coffee table or leave them at church.
[02:38:11.669 --> 02:38:13.270]  I mean, this is how we get stuff done here!
[02:38:13.865 --> 02:38:24.629]  1-800-516-8736 800-516-8736 or if you missed the number you can get off their website newswatchmagazine.org newswatchmagazine.org 1-800-516-8736 or just send a envelope with a card in it with your address and name requesting the magazine to P.O.
[02:38:24.649 --> 02:38:25.930]  Box 36 Waxahachie
[02:38:43.334 --> 02:38:44.275]  Comanche name there.
[02:38:44.795 --> 02:38:45.095]  P.O.
[02:38:45.135 --> 02:38:48.177]  Box... That pretty name sounds like Waxahachie.
[02:38:48.938 --> 02:38:49.118]  P.O.
[02:38:49.138 --> 02:38:50.419]  Box 36, Waxahachie, Texas.
[02:38:50.439 --> 02:38:50.419]  75168.
[02:38:50.539 --> 02:38:53.180]  Waxahachie is W-A-X-A-H-A-C-H-I-E.
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:53.601]  P.O.
[02:38:53.621 --> 02:38:55.882]  Box 36, Waxahachie, Texas. 75168.
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:10.161]  Don't be mad once I get off air.
[02:39:10.221 --> 02:39:18.546]  It's focusing on these people and thinking about them and thinking about Alan Greenspan, a little piece of garbage, robbing me and my family.
[02:39:21.228 --> 02:39:23.009]  And see, it's knowing what comes next.
[02:39:23.149 --> 02:39:23.730]  All right, anyways.
[02:39:24.530 --> 02:39:25.951]  Newswatchmagazine.org 800-516-8736.
[02:39:26.051 --> 02:39:27.732]  And then another great sponsor, Shellacat.
[02:39:33.510 --> 02:39:51.221]  It's got a bunch of other great herbs and things in it, but it's just an alluvial deposit of minerals from the mountains and it's some interaction with fungus and it creates, I looked into it before I took the sponsor, it's really an amazing ionic form mineral that you should really read about.
[02:39:51.861 --> 02:39:55.944]  It's got fulvic acids, it's one of the most powerful natural electrolyte carriers, it's got a bunch of really
[02:39:57.711 --> 02:39:59.171]  Fancy dandy stuff in it.
[02:39:59.231 --> 02:40:01.032]  Blacklistedherb.com to order.
[02:40:01.072 --> 02:40:03.632]  Blacklistedherb.com or 877-327-0365.
[02:40:03.692 --> 02:40:07.193]  You don't have to pay for it for a month.
[02:40:08.133 --> 02:40:10.893]  And if you don't like it in a month, just call them and tell them to cancel the invoice.
[02:40:10.913 --> 02:40:11.173]  877-327-0365.
[02:40:11.193 --> 02:40:11.313]  877-327-0365.
[02:40:11.333 --> 02:40:11.854]  Blacklistedherb.com.
[02:40:11.874 --> 02:40:12.874]  You know, it's not that big of a deal.
[02:40:12.894 --> 02:40:13.154]  I'm not upset.
[02:40:26.596 --> 02:40:27.736]  I just analyzed myself.
[02:40:28.676 --> 02:40:33.757]  I'm not even that upset that they are going to go ahead and take the full plunge and kill the dollar.
[02:40:33.877 --> 02:40:37.098]  I mean, I was freaked out Sunday when they all started announcing the end of the dollar.
[02:40:37.118 --> 02:40:37.778]  And I said, that's it.
[02:40:37.798 --> 02:40:39.018]  It's going to go down this week even more.
[02:40:39.698 --> 02:40:42.439]  And other countries are going to start dumping it, and this is going to accelerate the slide.
[02:40:42.459 --> 02:40:46.120]  It's just a bunch of mean old men, man.
[02:40:46.140 --> 02:40:47.080]  They're so greedy.
[02:40:47.120 --> 02:40:48.600]  They're hard-nosed.
[02:40:48.620 --> 02:40:49.460]  They're cold-blooded.
[02:40:55.931 --> 02:40:58.294]  I'm upset because they do everything they say they're going to do.
[02:40:59.635 --> 02:41:02.578]  I'm upset because they keep following their plan no matter what.
[02:41:03.098 --> 02:41:04.560]  They said they'd go into Iran.
[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:05.621]  They said they'd go into Syria.
[02:41:05.641 --> 02:41:06.582]  They said they'd go into Iraq.
[02:41:06.602 --> 02:41:07.783]  It means they're going to go into Iran.
[02:41:08.864 --> 02:41:11.607]  They said they'd stage terror attacks and bring in a new world order.
[02:41:12.448 --> 02:41:15.752]  They said they were going to force drug the whole population and start culling our numbers.
[02:41:15.772 --> 02:41:16.933]  And that means they're going to do that too.
[02:41:17.992 --> 02:41:32.099]  I mean, it means a lot of bad stuff's gonna happen, and even for me, who fights this all the time and deals with it, and knows my life's on the line, and knows how criminal these people are, and knows the only reason I'm still alive is God's grace and the fact that I'm a public person, it just lets me know this stuff's really real.
[02:41:32.139 --> 02:41:42.064]  I mean, it hits me every day, too, you know, that, my gosh, these people really are pure wicked, pure evil, and they really are destroying our country after it empowered their New World Order.
[02:41:42.104 --> 02:41:44.225]  But we have to fall for their New World Order to rise.
[02:41:46.730 --> 02:41:49.832]  And then I just get disgusted thinking about the general know-it-all public.
[02:41:53.574 --> 02:41:54.955]  Just dumber than dirt, man.
[02:41:55.836 --> 02:42:01.239]  See, the general public is so self-centered and so thinking about themselves all the time.
[02:42:02.034 --> 02:42:03.755]  They miss out on the whole world around them.
[02:42:03.775 --> 02:42:18.464]  They miss out, not just on the horror of the New World Order and all, it's interesting to look at that, just from a voyeuristic point of view, but also from the goodness in life, and all the other interesting things, and how people work, and how, just the mysteries of the world, and they just, I realize, most people aren't even alive!
[02:42:20.725 --> 02:42:23.887]  And I want to wake them up, because they're the key to turning this around and stopping it!
[02:42:23.907 --> 02:42:27.709]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[02:42:27.849 --> 02:42:29.890]  Just, I'm moving really fast in your calls.
[02:42:29.930 --> 02:42:30.651]  Who's up next here?
[02:42:33.212 --> 02:42:35.913]  Joe in Missouri, then Adam, Lucas, Walter, Bill.
[02:42:36.354 --> 02:42:36.974]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:42:37.554 --> 02:42:38.655]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:42:39.255 --> 02:42:40.675]  I understand your frustration.
[02:42:40.836 --> 02:42:42.796]  I appreciate your passion very much.
[02:42:42.816 --> 02:42:45.878]  Well, I appreciate you calling and putting up with me, but go ahead.
[02:42:46.298 --> 02:42:47.178]  Thank you for doing what you're doing.
[02:42:47.438 --> 02:42:49.960]  I have two pieces of information I wanted to pass on to you.
[02:42:50.740 --> 02:42:56.102]  One first is, I didn't know if you got any wind of the Oprah show on Tuesday.
[02:42:56.142 --> 02:42:59.584]  She had Jenny McCarthy on, the model and actress.
[02:43:00.391 --> 02:43:10.919]  Uh, she was, uh, her son has autism and she was given her whole story and, and uh, then she finally gave her speculations of why she, her son got autism.
[02:43:11.319 --> 02:43:13.220]  And she also had another actress with her as well.
[02:43:13.601 --> 02:43:18.384]  And she was... Janie McCarthy, uh, we're, we're trying to get her on, and whose show is she on?
[02:43:19.085 --> 02:43:19.365]  Oprah.
[02:43:20.806 --> 02:43:22.507]  It was on Oprah, uh, last year.
[02:43:22.527 --> 02:43:28.331]  Now, now, I haven't seen it, but I read the synopsis and, and, and basically, uh, she was on the show saying that it's the Mercury?
[02:43:28.872 --> 02:43:29.052]  Yes.
[02:43:29.693 --> 02:43:33.858]  Yes, she said it was the vaccine.
[02:43:33.898 --> 02:43:44.230]  And then she had Oprah read a report from the health whatever company saying that they don't know about the Marisol, they're still running tests or something like that.
[02:43:46.149 --> 02:43:51.330]  Yeah, they just wrote in books in the 20s that they were going to give everybody a 20 point IQ reduction.
[02:43:51.671 --> 02:43:56.732]  See, what happens is with girls and boys, you get a 20 point IQ reduction on average from the studies.
[02:43:57.212 --> 02:44:04.854]  But boys that are missing a gene, or the point is the gene is turned off and it allows greater blood-brain barrier transmission.
[02:44:05.854 --> 02:44:10.376]  They did studies in Japan where a certain number of boys would get autism because of the mercury.
[02:44:10.476 --> 02:44:11.356]  Others would pass it.
[02:44:12.074 --> 02:44:20.897]  You see, so then, that's the, and then they use that disinfo to say, well, they don't get the autism, uh, because, uh, you know, it's genetic.
[02:44:21.358 --> 02:44:22.278]  Well, it is genetic.
[02:44:22.318 --> 02:44:24.139]  It's genetic that the mercury's allowed through.
[02:44:24.599 --> 02:44:24.939]  Go ahead.
[02:44:25.819 --> 02:44:37.824]  Well, they, uh, her story was very moving, not just that it was, uh, sorrow, you know, sorrow for a child, but she actually, uh, gave really in-depth on, she felt that it was bad when she was giving it to him.
[02:44:37.884 --> 02:44:39.144]  She tried to talk to the doctor.
[02:44:39.204 --> 02:44:41.245]  She knew, she knew in her gut.
[02:44:41.812 --> 02:44:42.753]  Yes, that's what she said.
[02:44:42.793 --> 02:44:45.134]  And didn't follow that gut!
[02:44:45.474 --> 02:44:53.579]  Well, no, she questioned the doctor that was administering it, and he said, no, it's paranoia from the mothers, you know, that need to blame something.
[02:44:54.100 --> 02:44:59.623]  And she was like... Let me guess, the child had a seizure and was gone?
[02:44:59.743 --> 02:45:02.245]  He had a seizure and all that, like, shortly after.
[02:45:02.465 --> 02:45:04.426]  I've never seen it, don't even know.
[02:45:04.686 --> 02:45:05.607]  It's always the same.
[02:45:05.807 --> 02:45:08.629]  Now, hers went into convulsions, though, on the second injection, correct?
[02:45:09.466 --> 02:45:10.967]  I do not know when exactly.
[02:45:10.987 --> 02:45:18.109]  I'm pretty sure it was like, it wasn't the first... Think of the cold, black, naked, fisted power.
[02:45:18.189 --> 02:45:24.212]  Black pits of hell to knowingly brain damage the entire public with pleasure.
[02:45:25.212 --> 02:45:28.313]  And the dumbass public... I apologize, I'm not going to get mad.
[02:45:28.793 --> 02:45:30.934]  The idiot public continues to take it.
[02:45:31.094 --> 02:45:32.515]  I can't take it anymore!
[02:45:33.055 --> 02:45:34.076]  I totally understand.
[02:45:34.236 --> 02:45:37.237]  I feel like I was trying to tell my friends the same thing, trying to explain it to them.
[02:45:37.277 --> 02:45:38.097]  They won't listen.
[02:45:38.117 --> 02:45:39.918]  They've got us experienced at first.
[02:45:40.638 --> 02:45:43.399]  The children have to pay because of their ignorance.
[02:45:43.419 --> 02:45:45.000]  Well, they wouldn't believe it, you know.
[02:45:45.020 --> 02:45:46.541]  Of course they won't!
[02:45:46.761 --> 02:45:47.561]  They're scum!
[02:45:49.770 --> 02:45:53.392]  A couple of moms I know, they were like, why would they do that to us?
[02:45:53.452 --> 02:45:54.112]  Exactly!
[02:45:54.152 --> 02:45:56.454]  Because they're not like you, idiot!
[02:45:56.674 --> 02:45:57.734]  They're cold-blooded!
[02:45:57.955 --> 02:45:59.916]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:46:00.176 --> 02:46:02.337]  The idiot doctor isn't the bad one.
[02:46:02.377 --> 02:46:03.538]  They just believe it too.
[02:46:04.658 --> 02:46:07.260]  Look, I'm telling you folks, it's eugenics.
[02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:08.100]  It's endgame.
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:09.461]  It's so bad, I can't...
[02:46:11.380 --> 02:46:13.221]  It isn't even normal for me to do a show.
[02:46:13.301 --> 02:46:16.524]  Things are so bad it almost disrespects the subject to even talk about it.
[02:46:16.624 --> 02:46:20.086]  It's so bad, people, that I can't explain it to you.
[02:46:21.107 --> 02:46:22.328]  Thank you, Joe.
[02:46:22.948 --> 02:46:24.289]  Adam in Florida, go ahead.
[02:46:26.511 --> 02:46:26.751]  Alex.
[02:46:27.051 --> 02:46:27.391]  Yes, sir?
[02:46:27.411 --> 02:46:31.754]  On the subject of water, you were talking earlier about you don't want to drink the tap water.
[02:46:31.774 --> 02:46:32.775]  Hundreds of poisons.
[02:46:33.195 --> 02:46:34.056]  Hundreds of poisons.
[02:46:34.336 --> 02:46:38.159]  Well, a bigger issue, really, is the dermal absorption and the inhalation in your shower.
[02:46:38.749 --> 02:46:39.049]  I know.
[02:46:39.469 --> 02:46:42.990]  There's several studies out there that have been done that show that you absorb it through your skin.
[02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:44.210]  It goes right into the bloodstream.
[02:46:44.230 --> 02:46:53.172]  That's why lung cancer in women is up six times what it previously was, and with non-smokers, and most of it is the inhalation.
[02:46:53.492 --> 02:46:53.912]  That's right.
[02:46:53.952 --> 02:46:56.973]  Well, it's the trihalomethanes from the byproduct of chlorination.
[02:46:57.873 --> 02:47:00.374]  It doesn't matter.
[02:47:00.394 --> 02:47:01.234]  They're not going to listen.
[02:47:03.516 --> 02:47:06.097]  Well, the biggest thing is you don't want to brush your teeth with it.
[02:47:06.117 --> 02:47:06.938]  You don't want to shower in it.
[02:47:06.978 --> 02:47:10.820]  It's good to have a Berkey countertop unit, but you also want a whole house unit.
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:11.700]  You don't want a softener.
[02:47:11.720 --> 02:47:13.821]  You don't want to put that corrosive salt in your house.
[02:47:14.281 --> 02:47:17.343]  But that's hard to do.
[02:47:17.403 --> 02:47:22.525]  Just give your children regular water and let them take a shower without a filter.
[02:47:23.245 --> 02:47:24.946]  It stays in your blood for 24 hours.
[02:47:25.046 --> 02:47:30.409]  If you shower every day, or worse yet, if you go to the gym and shower twice, my God, it's double exposure.
[02:47:31.958 --> 02:47:32.878]  I know, I know.
[02:47:32.958 --> 02:47:35.239]  It's just eugenics attack modes everywhere.
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:38.281]  Government documents that they're doing it and you still can't convince them.
[02:47:40.041 --> 02:47:40.902]  You just can't tell them.
[02:47:41.562 --> 02:47:42.342]  One last thing, Alex.
[02:47:42.362 --> 02:47:45.343]  I'd like to give a shout out to the Ron Paul Meetup in Pensacola.
[02:47:46.224 --> 02:47:48.184]  And I'd like to plug my website, if that's alright.
[02:47:48.284 --> 02:47:49.445]  HealthyWaterMan.com.
[02:47:49.765 --> 02:47:50.365]  Okay, buddy.
[02:47:50.405 --> 02:47:51.346]  Thanks a lot for the call.
[02:47:52.226 --> 02:47:54.207]  Why don't you be a sponsor for us if it's good products.
[02:47:54.267 --> 02:47:56.908]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Lucas in South Carolina.
[02:47:57.288 --> 02:47:57.828]  You're on the air.
[02:47:57.848 --> 02:47:58.448]  We're about to break.
[02:47:58.468 --> 02:47:59.629]  I'll hold you over, but go ahead, Lucas.
[02:48:00.467 --> 02:48:00.927]  Hey, Alex.
[02:48:01.287 --> 02:48:01.548]  Hi.
[02:48:02.968 --> 02:48:04.349]  Are you calming down and stuff?
[02:48:04.709 --> 02:48:05.189]  I'm trying.
[02:48:05.730 --> 02:48:06.410]  Alright, that's good.
[02:48:06.810 --> 02:48:09.591]  I was just wanting to talk about evil people.
[02:48:09.611 --> 02:48:21.017]  I'd like to know why you think it is that, despite the fact that it's pretty much common knowledge that there's evil people in pretty much every walk of life, why there is that so many people still seem to have the contention that
[02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:24.272]  Those in high places in society just cannot be evil.
[02:48:24.492 --> 02:48:27.554]  Because subliminal programming, people used to know evil.
[02:48:27.814 --> 02:48:30.556]  They've been subliminally programmed by the television, that's the main mode.
[02:48:31.377 --> 02:48:33.458]  I mean, people are actually mesmerized.
[02:48:33.798 --> 02:48:36.940]  I mean, that's in 101 RTF, that the television hypnotizes.
[02:48:37.461 --> 02:48:39.922]  Stay there, I'll let you finish up, then we'll get to Walter and Bill.
[02:48:40.222 --> 02:48:43.525]  They're hypnotizing, the public is literally under a spell!
[02:48:49.210 --> 02:48:49.651]  It's here!
[02:48:49.871 --> 02:48:54.659]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:55.019 --> 02:49:02.671]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.348 --> 02:49:10.393]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.814 --> 02:49:22.282]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.542 --> 02:49:26.105]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.505 --> 02:49:28.447]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.767 --> 02:49:32.550]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.189 --> 02:49:49.071]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:49:49.411 --> 02:49:52.292]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:49:52.512 --> 02:49:58.716]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[02:50:45.778 --> 02:50:47.739]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[02:50:47.999 --> 02:50:51.041]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[02:50:51.321 --> 02:50:56.103]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[02:50:56.403 --> 02:50:59.145]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[02:50:59.405 --> 02:51:04.067]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[02:51:04.347 --> 02:51:06.248]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[02:51:06.728 --> 02:51:16.677]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[02:51:17.057 --> 02:51:21.741]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[02:51:22.122 --> 02:51:25.645]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[02:51:25.865 --> 02:51:28.007]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[02:51:28.327 --> 02:51:30.449]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[02:51:30.649 --> 02:51:32.390]  Look out your window babe, there's a scene you'd like to catch!
[02:51:57.543 --> 02:51:58.864]  Yeah, that's what's up.
[02:52:26.628 --> 02:52:28.770]  Lucas is saying, and we'll go to Walter, the final caller.
[02:52:29.410 --> 02:52:32.012]  Lucas, you were making a point about people can't recognize evil.
[02:52:33.673 --> 02:52:33.913]  Right.
[02:52:34.133 --> 02:52:35.194]  Or they can't believe it exists.
[02:52:35.214 --> 02:52:35.534]  Go ahead.
[02:52:35.554 --> 02:52:36.074]  Right.
[02:52:36.114 --> 02:52:44.800]  All I wanted to say was, does it not make a lot of sense that truly evil people would do anything that they can to get in a position of power so they can actually truly carry out what they have in mind, you know?
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.482]  Which is why evil tends to get in positions of power.
[02:52:47.882 --> 02:52:48.362]  Exactly.
[02:52:48.482 --> 02:52:49.263]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:52:49.323 --> 02:52:54.326]  Why can't people recognize the fact that there's evil people, and there's going to be evil people, especially in high positions?
[02:52:54.606 --> 02:53:00.808]  And that's why you restrict the size of government, that's why you go after government corruption, like... Look at a guy like Giuliani.
[02:53:01.028 --> 02:53:02.529]  All you have to do is look at the guy.
[02:53:02.909 --> 02:53:03.349]  You know what I mean?
[02:53:04.010 --> 02:53:12.553]  Oh, he just radiates... I've seen all these things that We Are Change have done, you know, confronting the guy, and you can see just looking at the guy, just looking at the guy's eyes, you know?
[02:53:13.353 --> 02:53:18.395]  He doesn't want to respond to the questions, he turns around, he starts smirking, he starts smiling, laughing, walking away, you know?
[02:53:19.275 --> 02:53:21.416]  I don't know, some people you just have to look at and you just know.
[02:53:23.121 --> 02:53:24.262]  Yeah, like Hillary Clinton.
[02:53:24.842 --> 02:53:26.163]  Like Hitler Clinton.
[02:53:26.384 --> 02:53:26.744]  That's right.
[02:53:27.404 --> 02:53:28.265]  I appreciate your call.
[02:53:28.485 --> 02:53:29.926]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[02:53:29.946 --> 02:53:30.607]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:31.027 --> 02:53:32.588]  Walter in Arizona, last caller.
[02:53:32.608 --> 02:53:33.129]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:53:34.069 --> 02:53:35.050]  Hello, Alex.
[02:53:35.410 --> 02:53:35.751]  Hi.
[02:53:36.631 --> 02:53:40.474]  You have a 14-year commodity trading advisor online right now.
[02:53:40.534 --> 02:53:41.475]  Hey, it's Walter Berrian.
[02:53:41.495 --> 02:53:42.136]  What's up, buddy?
[02:53:43.136 --> 02:53:49.641]  Oh, you're getting so mad about the dollar and the aspect of gold not mentioned.
[02:53:50.262 --> 02:53:51.683]  I figured I'd call in and bring
[02:53:52.759 --> 02:53:55.840]  Bring up a few points, which I've learned over the years.
[02:53:55.880 --> 02:54:04.343]  Well, if I'd have gone to you earlier, Walter, if I knew it was you, but exposing the comprehensive annual financial reports, maybe I should set you up tomorrow for 30 minutes or something.
[02:54:04.623 --> 02:54:06.643]  We're just so jam-packed with stuff, we're about to go to break.
[02:54:06.663 --> 02:54:07.764]  Go ahead, you've got 60 seconds.
[02:54:08.464 --> 02:54:18.887]  Okay, the bottom line is the Federal Reserve, when they switched over from the gold standard into paper money, it was strictly to give them the ability to print as much as possible,
[02:54:19.477 --> 02:54:25.781]  To build as much as possible, to expand as much as possible, and to grow all the corporations as much as possible with nothing backing it.
[02:54:27.262 --> 02:54:30.384]  And then they leave us holding the bag telling us it's all our fault, yes.
[02:54:30.684 --> 02:54:35.347]  Right, but the key point here is government got involved on the greed aspect.
[02:54:35.847 --> 02:54:38.188]  Government has been taking over the entire investment arena.
[02:54:38.529 --> 02:54:42.571]  The credit market, the insurance industry, the stock market by investment.
[02:54:43.007 --> 02:54:46.329]  And now government owns the entire cookie jar by investment.
[02:54:46.870 --> 02:54:49.371]  So they are determining the prices of the cookies.
[02:54:50.392 --> 02:54:55.075]  So in other words, the dollar now drops down through a new low of 40 years.
[02:54:57.577 --> 02:55:02.140]  The policy of our own government is to see a drop or at this point in time.
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:08.104]  And if we have a minute or two, when we come back from break, if I can... No, there is no break, Walter.
[02:55:08.284 --> 02:55:09.345]  We're at the end of the show.
[02:55:10.484 --> 02:55:12.705]  Let's do 30 minutes tomorrow and we'll cover all those points.
[02:55:13.045 --> 02:55:16.146]  Okay, I'll get Trey to call you, or you can call in the office right now.
[02:55:16.186 --> 02:55:16.766]  I appreciate it.
[02:55:16.786 --> 02:55:21.968]  Walter Burien, we carry the video I produced with him, comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[02:55:22.348 --> 02:55:25.109]  Gets into the whole fraudulent nature of the Federal Reserve and the whole system.
[02:55:25.430 --> 02:55:27.070]  Would be a good time to have Walter on the show.
[02:55:27.090 --> 02:55:33.673]  I remember having him on about eight months ago and he said, we've got to change this the next year, it's all over!
[02:55:34.453 --> 02:55:37.394]  Government now owns 75% of the markets, it's true!
[02:55:38.271 --> 02:55:40.434]  Man, folks, they don't even need free market anymore.
[02:55:40.494 --> 02:55:41.295]  It's all gone.
[02:55:41.315 --> 02:55:44.919]  I mean, it green spans our friend.
[02:55:45.921 --> 02:55:49.365]  I didn't plug my videos really yesterday, and I haven't really plugged them today.
[02:55:49.645 --> 02:55:50.326]  I'm a filmmaker.
[02:55:50.847 --> 02:55:56.073]  I've made 16 films, Terror Storm, Final Cut's out, a bunch of great books and videos available at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:57.339 --> 02:56:01.781]  I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com, just peruse the site, and your purchase supports this broadcast.
[02:56:02.121 --> 02:56:06.943]  But the main issue is they're powerful films and books to inform you, your neighbors, your friends, your family, even more.
[02:56:07.263 --> 02:56:08.884]  And information is the key in this fight.
[02:56:09.344 --> 02:56:11.125]  We gotta wake the dumbed-down public up.
[02:56:12.225 --> 02:56:15.307]  I'll be back on the network tonight, 9 to midnight, on stations near you.
[02:56:15.327 --> 02:56:20.969]  I want to thank all those affiliates, and then restream for the first hour of the show, where I talk about how they're taking blood at checkpoints.
[02:56:21.009 --> 02:56:23.570]  It's gonna start right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:56:23.630 --> 02:56:24.531]  So we'll be right back.
[02:56:25.896 --> 02:56:30.592]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
