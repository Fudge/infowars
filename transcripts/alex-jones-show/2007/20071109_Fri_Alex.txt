[00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:09.745]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:11.206]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:12.887]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.548 --> 00:00:17.471]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.794]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:33.323]  We have a very important broadcast lined up for you today with, of course, all the different huge developments going on in military affairs worldwide.
[00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:37.846]  It's happening to the planetary economy controlled by the New World Order.
[00:00:39.888 --> 00:00:43.210]  And, of course, today we're going to launch a little early.
[00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.451]  We like surprises.
[00:00:44.952 --> 00:00:46.933]  Loose change, final cut.
[00:00:47.754 --> 00:00:51.637]  You can start pre-ordering the DVD today.
[00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:03.910]  And we said we were going to start shipping in out the week of the 20th, but I'm conferring with the loose change crew because the DVDs have come in, been tested, super high quality, and so we've got them out here on pallets.
[00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:05.812]  Why not start selling them?
[00:01:06.613 --> 00:01:16.043]  But you can start pre-ordering them now, and they will definitely ship by the 20th, probably ship just in the next week or so, but we're conferring on that.
[00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.110]  It's official launch date on the internet will be this Sunday at midnight.
[00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.891]  That is going into Monday morning.
[00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:27.372]  Sunday evening, start your engines.
[00:01:28.992 --> 00:01:37.855]  We are going to put it out and it is a super high quality flash and in other formats and you'll be able to go up to InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:45.386]  In the next hour and a half and see the new website we built for Loose Change Final Cut.
[00:01:45.426 --> 00:01:50.828]  You can also go over to LooseChange911.com in the next hour or so.
[00:01:51.208 --> 00:01:53.989]  The order button will be up there to order the DVD from those guys.
[00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:55.069]  You can get it two places.
[00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.771]  You can get it from PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and the new site we built we're going to be linking to and launching today.
[00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:07.153]  Or you can simply go over to the LooseChange911.com
[00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:09.982]  We're good to go.
[00:02:38.121 --> 00:02:43.466]  We have Larry Pratt with very serious attacks on the Second Amendment that you need to be made aware of as we defend the Second Amendment.
[00:02:43.486 --> 00:02:44.627]  We're fighting on many fronts here.
[00:02:45.167 --> 00:02:46.388]  Not by choice, we have to.
[00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:53.414]  Joining us in one hour, and we've got Turk Pipkin coming up in the third hour.
[00:02:53.434 --> 00:02:56.256]  Now, Turk's been in, I don't know, 20, 30 movies.
[00:02:57.497 --> 00:03:00.320]  The Sopranos, a bunch of national TV shows.
[00:03:01.491 --> 00:03:02.952]  And he's in Scanner Darkly.
[00:03:03.012 --> 00:03:08.997]  In fact, he plays the part of a 50-eyed green alien in that movie I'm in.
[00:03:09.037 --> 00:03:16.323]  And a couple of our scenes are right next to each other, his running into mine bullhorning and being SWAT teamed and drug away.
[00:03:17.324 --> 00:03:23.949]  And I kept hearing about this film about people going to Africa and putting in water systems, individuals trying to help, and how do we actually help people.
[00:03:25.851 --> 00:03:34.057]  And that's what Turk does, so he'll be with us in the third hour in the studio, and he made the film Nobility.
[00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:37.499]  Spelled Nobility, like No-bell-ity.
[00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:38.299]  No-bell-ity.
[00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.920]  No-bell.
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.582]  Because he interviewed, I don't know, is it ten Nobel Prize winners or more?
[00:03:43.323 --> 00:03:46.845]  In this film, and he went to Africa, and his own experiences there.
[00:03:46.885 --> 00:03:48.006]  He's a big world traveler.
[00:03:48.026 --> 00:03:52.689]  And I just thought, I better get Turk on, because I saw him with Willie Nelson.
[00:03:53.584 --> 00:03:54.164]  I don't think so.
[00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:18.467]  And there's Kirk Pipkin.
[00:04:18.488 --> 00:04:20.830]  I was like, you know, I think this means I keep running into you.
[00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:21.731]  You need to come on the show.
[00:04:22.111 --> 00:04:28.157]  And I finally saw his film, Novelity, and it's very important work.
[00:04:28.257 --> 00:04:36.965]  So he'll be joining us coming up in the third hour today in the studio.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.242]  Now we're going to open the phones up in this first hour for any discussion, any issue, any news item you want to talk about.
[00:04:45.262 --> 00:04:50.863]  1-800-259-9231 as we watch the economy go into free fall.
[00:04:51.924 --> 00:04:56.085]  As we watch the neocons engage in every type of crime you can imagine.
[00:04:56.205 --> 00:05:01.306]  As we see preachers come out and say, Giuliani's of the Lord and Jesus isn't the Messiah.
[00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:03.087]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:06.788]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:18.857]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.617 --> 00:05:26.981]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.942 --> 00:05:34.925]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:38.907]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.267 --> 00:05:41.769]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:42.810]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.730]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:44.831]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.051 --> 00:05:45.851]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.052 --> 00:05:47.052]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:03.444]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[00:07:03.724 --> 00:07:04.985]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:06.127]  It's in your body.
[00:07:06.387 --> 00:07:10.231]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:14.635]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[00:07:14.775 --> 00:07:21.962]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.

[00:07:48.383 --> 00:07:51.365]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:51.386 --> 00:07:52.526]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.427 --> 00:08:36.438]  I have had great disquiet in the last few months, only growing, only intensifying, and even people that I talk to who aren't aware of the geopolitical maneuvering and cataclysms that are taking place on a daily basis,
[00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:43.512]  They are having a lot of anxiety and saying they feel like something really big is coming, something really bad is going to happen.
[00:08:45.013 --> 00:08:49.135]  All of the apprehension, all of the foreboding, all the omens that we're seeing.
[00:08:50.435 --> 00:09:00.519]  And I myself have been having a lot of moments of great research clarity, really discovering a lot of things I didn't know.
[00:09:01.858 --> 00:09:07.122]  And our research, and everyone's research, seems to be waxing, intensifying.
[00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:18.691]  At the same time, I am, again, in great disquiet, and have been very upset, very, very angry, to the point of doing some of my TV shows, I'm not even yelling and screaming.
[00:09:18.711 --> 00:09:25.556]  I'm so angry, I'm not even yelling, because we are really seeing the whole New World Order system
[00:09:27.987 --> 00:09:41.915]  Build towards its penultimate goal, and if they gain their goal, whether it's next year or ten years from now or thirty years from now, it means massive forced population extermination, reduction, infanticide, you name it.
[00:09:43.776 --> 00:09:54.663]  And to be clear, I am not saying in endgame that, as some of my detractors have tried to claim, that in one year, five years, or next month the elite are going to
[00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.651]  Run around in mass and exterminate us.
[00:10:00.072 --> 00:10:08.518]  What I am saying is, that is their plan, that is their stated goal in United Nations Biological Diversity Global Assessments.
[00:10:09.599 --> 00:10:15.522]  These are official documents certified by the United Nations, by their organs.
[00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:17.544]  These are canons.
[00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:18.104]  These are laws.
[00:10:18.144 --> 00:10:19.045]  These are manifestos.
[00:10:19.065 --> 00:10:20.005]  These are programs.
[00:10:20.045 --> 00:10:20.906]  These are agendas.
[00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:33.351]  Last night at the Alamo Draft House, I'm sorry, about 50 people against the door got turned away.
[00:10:33.391 --> 00:10:33.992]  It sold out.
[00:10:35.112 --> 00:10:52.866]  And only out of a small crowd of people, they hadn't heard me talk about it on air, though I have quite a bit, and in my speech I mentioned, hey, we didn't put in this film Bayer executives in France being arrested, the only country that actually did the right thing and arrested people.
[00:10:56.701 --> 00:10:59.882]  But in Australia, Canada, the U.S., and other countries, they didn't.
[00:11:00.402 --> 00:11:16.545]  And their own documents came out where they knew that the Factor VIII blood product for hemophiliacs, every dose of the so-called drug, the blood product drug, had HIV in it.
[00:11:17.325 --> 00:11:21.526]  And it gave everyone who took it that it was infected by HIV.
[00:11:27.552 --> 00:11:32.254]  At the end, a gentleman and his wife walk up to me, who I believe were Latin American.
[00:11:34.255 --> 00:11:37.257]  And he said, yeah, my brother was a hemophiliac and took that and died.
[00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:39.238]  I didn't know you talked about that.
[00:11:40.258 --> 00:11:41.899]  And I didn't know they did it on purpose.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.800]  I knew it was in the Factor VIII.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:47.542]  And I was like, oh yeah, it's even been on national news now.
[00:11:48.782 --> 00:11:54.125]  And we've had Papantonio, one of the big lawyers that sued him and got all the documents to come out on the show.
[00:11:55.518 --> 00:11:56.819]  And he's been on Tucker Carlson.
[00:11:57.299 --> 00:11:58.619]  And the guy's like, that's incredible.
[00:11:58.679 --> 00:12:12.705]  So here out of this small crowd of people, and all of a sudden, two other folks walk up and they say, yeah, they said my dad or my uncle died of the factor VIII.
[00:12:13.305 --> 00:12:16.346]  He was a hemophiliac, took it and he got AIDS.
[00:12:19.528 --> 00:12:19.808]  And then
[00:12:21.818 --> 00:12:26.721]  Somebody else walks up and says, my cousin was a hemophiliac and died of a factor VIII, that blood drug.
[00:12:27.141 --> 00:12:41.790]  So what they did is, they would take the blood, they'd buy it from the Red Cross, who by the way certified it as wholesome, and then they would get and give it to Bayer Pharmaceutical, and they would ship it out.
[00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:50.855]  And they would take the, you know, pints of blood that thousands and thousands of people, even the smaller batches, had given and mix them all together.
[00:12:52.745 --> 00:12:57.707]  And then centrifugally extract the clotting agent.
[00:12:58.547 --> 00:13:05.049]  You put blood in a test tube and put it in a centrifuge and it divides out into its different unit parts.
[00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:14.712]  The plasma and the red blood cells and then the clotting agents, the platelets, the different things that are in there.
[00:13:14.732 --> 00:13:17.073]  The platelets are the dead blood cells, the body uses those.
[00:13:17.093 --> 00:13:19.734]  So they really just take the platelet protein
[00:13:20.578 --> 00:13:30.164]  And then inject it, and that's exactly where the viral injection ports and the viral plaques are secreted.
[00:13:30.204 --> 00:13:40.150]  So you're actually being injected with the exact cell parts that have the virus packets nesting on them.
[00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:44.393]  There's a debate over whether a virus is living or dead, or just information.
[00:13:44.413 --> 00:13:45.594]  It really is like a computer.
[00:13:46.194 --> 00:13:47.715]  Is a computer alive or dead is the question.
[00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:50.112]  We're good to go.
[00:14:08.849 --> 00:14:12.011]  And he was there and he even showed me, hey look, here's the gubernatorial boots.
[00:14:12.031 --> 00:14:13.472]  You're in about a pair of Gibbsies everybody.
[00:14:13.512 --> 00:14:14.893]  There is a Texas seal.
[00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:16.214]  I said, no, I've seen you on TV.
[00:14:16.754 --> 00:14:17.215]  I know who you are.
[00:14:17.235 --> 00:14:20.257]  And he said, well, listen, a lot of us on the staff are good folks and we're fans.
[00:14:20.297 --> 00:14:35.186]  And, you know, 12 years ago, before I got on the governor's staff, when he was in the state house, before he was governor and, you know, he's still there, by the way, in communications for him, he said, you know, I was a medic in the army at Fort Sam Houston.
[00:14:35.206 --> 00:14:37.468]  And they brought in these eight special forces officers.
[00:14:38.277 --> 00:14:39.558]  We were told to inject.
[00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:45.161]  They were there and they'd flown in from Fort Bliss.
[00:14:46.542 --> 00:14:50.625]  I told the story when I was fresh from it today after a few months ago, a month and a half ago.
[00:14:51.645 --> 00:14:57.649]  And he said, yeah, they all eight died within two days of horrible, you know, basically bleeding out.
[00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:04.874]  And he said, and then basically they told us, pull everything out, even pull the bunk beds out, spray them with bleach, scrub everything and mask.
[00:15:05.354 --> 00:15:05.934]  And that was it.
[00:15:05.974 --> 00:15:06.995]  And we basically all
[00:15:08.177 --> 00:15:10.639]  Came out with a grapevine that it was a bioweapons test.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.340]  That's what we thought it was.
[00:15:13.181 --> 00:15:18.645]  See, and then two other women come up and say, how did you, how do you know tetanus causes autoimmune problems?
[00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:19.686]  That's what happened to me.
[00:15:20.047 --> 00:15:22.589]  And they give, and one of them came on air and gave us the medical records.
[00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:26.151]  Because that's UN documents, that's why!
[00:15:26.171 --> 00:15:36.640]  I mean, you go to events with 200 people, and they're coming up out of the woodwork with people that have died, people they know, and we were told to give people these shots, and they died.
[00:15:40.134 --> 00:15:41.514]  And that's the compartmentalization!
[00:15:45.375 --> 00:16:02.499]  And so it gets to me, it really gets to me, that you can have all these official statements by the UN, you can have our own government signing the treaties for IMF and World Bank money, and State Department memorandum 200, to fund China's one-child policy,
[00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:10.307]  Where they imprison people, or force aboard, or kill already born babies, and then people get out there and make jokes about Endgame.
[00:16:10.387 --> 00:16:11.667]  It's not a joke!
[00:16:13.628 --> 00:16:18.909]  And I don't want my family being tested on the stuff being sprayed on them, and things being put in our food and water.
[00:16:18.969 --> 00:16:19.809]  I'm sick of it!
[00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:31.412]  We've been basted like the frog in the boiling pot for so long, that we can't even recognize
[00:16:32.466 --> 00:16:35.549]  What a serious situation we're all in.
[00:16:35.669 --> 00:16:39.312]  As freaked out as I am, that's just normalcy.
[00:16:39.352 --> 00:16:44.316]  That's me just getting down to the bedrock of what we face and what we're in.
[00:16:46.118 --> 00:16:48.300]  And what's happening in our society.
[00:16:51.903 --> 00:16:54.786]  And frankly, I'm not even worthy to do this radio show.
[00:16:55.426 --> 00:16:58.369]  And by that, this message is so important, so powerful.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:09.184]  That I don't think I do a very good job, but then I look at everybody else, the job they're doing, and I realize I'm doing the best job of anybody out there, and that freaks me out even more.
[00:17:09.824 --> 00:17:11.225]  The responsibility.
[00:17:11.785 --> 00:17:13.286]  How much faith you put in me.
[00:17:13.986 --> 00:17:15.947]  How many millions of people listen to me.
[00:17:20.109 --> 00:17:29.253]  And it makes me, frankly, ashamed of my shortcomings, and the type of person I am, and the type of aggressive temper I have, and the way I treat callers, and the things I do,
[00:17:30.325 --> 00:17:35.748]  The way I blow up on people, it's just, I... I'm real!
[00:17:37.529 --> 00:17:48.194]  That's why people listen to this show, because I've done the research and I'm a real person, but at the same time, don't expect me to be perfect, and please don't think that I think I'm perfect.
[00:17:53.196 --> 00:17:54.157]  I just love God.
[00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.208]  And I love innocence.
[00:17:56.828 --> 00:17:57.648]  And I love beauty.
[00:17:58.389 --> 00:17:59.209]  And I love honor.
[00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:00.810]  And I love goodness.
[00:18:01.991 --> 00:18:04.672]  And I am, at heart, a good person.
[00:18:06.573 --> 00:18:11.636]  And I know there are a lot of good people out there listening, and you have love in your heart, too.
[00:18:12.976 --> 00:18:15.738]  And you feel threatened by all the things that are happening.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.141]  You know, there's a duality of man, but it's more than just a duality.
[00:18:22.161 --> 00:18:23.682]  There are so many facets and so many
[00:18:24.321 --> 00:18:27.862]  You know, sub-personalities to all of us and so many different modes that we live in.
[00:18:32.223 --> 00:18:36.584]  But I more and more am just having my ego completely blasted away from me.
[00:18:37.104 --> 00:18:48.466]  And it is an empowering and enlightening but at the same time painful process to be losing my ego but gaining so much more in return.
[00:18:49.275 --> 00:19:01.398]  But I do become enraged now at others that are literally seized and controlled by tunnel vision of what's happening in their own little personal world.
[00:19:02.858 --> 00:19:18.122]  Instead of seeing the big picture that we are living in what appears to be the first days of worldwide warfare, famine, bioweapons, nuclear detonations, economic conflagration,
[00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:20.612]  And it didn't have to happen.
[00:19:21.273 --> 00:19:25.996]  We didn't have to be a weak, decadent, sick society, myself included.
[00:19:27.217 --> 00:19:37.945]  And I don't know if we can pull out of it, but I know that the least we can do is get ready for it and try to get ourselves right with God and right with our friends and right with our families.
[00:19:38.946 --> 00:19:39.547]  We'll come back.
[00:19:40.247 --> 00:19:41.368]  Take calls for the rest of the hour.
[00:19:41.388 --> 00:19:45.751]  I'm not even going to cover the dollar plunging again today and everything that's happening.
[00:19:45.992 --> 00:19:47.533]  You know what's going on.
[00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:52.893]  We'll talk about whatever you want to discuss on the other side at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:03.198 --> 00:20:04.259]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:10.145]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:20:10.726 --> 00:20:11.206]  That's right.
[00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:14.429]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:21.296]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:20:21.852 --> 00:20:29.557]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:20:29.997 --> 00:20:34.860]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:20:35.481 --> 00:20:38.522]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:41.284 --> 00:20:45.426]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:20:45.787 --> 00:20:46.047]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:46.067 --> 00:20:47.988]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:48.368]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:20:48.388 --> 00:20:48.928]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.992 --> 00:21:08.433]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:21:08.853 --> 00:21:13.574]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:21:13.974 --> 00:21:16.595]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:21:17.095 --> 00:21:20.516]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:21:21.276 --> 00:21:25.617]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:29.237]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:21:29.817 --> 00:21:32.678]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:35.240]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.741]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:21:37.761 --> 00:21:38.101]  U.S.
[00:21:38.161 --> 00:21:39.801]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:21:39.821 --> 00:21:40.201]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:21:40.441 --> 00:21:41.022]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:21:41.042 --> 00:21:41.722]  Ask for George.
[00:22:02.202 --> 00:22:04.744]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.245 --> 00:22:13.313]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:19.120]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[00:22:19.844 --> 00:22:27.289]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.833]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[00:22:32.713 --> 00:22:36.036]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[00:22:36.916 --> 00:22:41.300]  And offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:41.901 --> 00:22:43.442]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.503 --> 00:22:43.843]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:43.903 --> 00:22:44.323]  Call now.
[00:22:44.403 --> 00:22:46.926]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:01.085 --> 00:23:02.246]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[00:23:02.266 --> 00:23:04.647]  I'm the nuclear medical report here on Genesis.
[00:23:04.787 --> 00:23:07.769]  Allison's natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:23:07.809 --> 00:23:08.489]  is a real thing.
[00:23:08.569 --> 00:23:15.453]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:23:15.573 --> 00:23:20.856]  Allison molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:23:21.036 --> 00:23:21.777]  We're good to go!
[00:23:47.856 --> 00:23:51.158]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:23:51.178 --> 00:23:51.799]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:23:51.859 --> 00:23:54.721]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:24:01.152 --> 00:24:05.515]  Way up north to the last gun to go north across your zone.
[00:24:18.684 --> 00:24:35.038]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of 92 With George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too They crossed the Yukon River and found the Bonanza Gold
[00:24:35.778 --> 00:24:46.683]  Below that old white mountain, just a little south-east of Nome, Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
[00:24:47.143 --> 00:24:57.428]  He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow, with the northern lights a-runnin' wild in the land of the midnight sun.
[00:24:59.949 --> 00:25:10.157]  That's pretty poetry, isn't it?
[00:25:11.598 --> 00:25:17.062]  Jeff, Dave, Nima, Tristan, many others, you're on air.
[00:25:17.563 --> 00:25:19.424]  Jeff, from Kentucky, welcome.
[00:25:21.106 --> 00:25:21.606]  Hey, Alex.
[00:25:21.906 --> 00:25:22.186]  Hi.
[00:25:23.527 --> 00:25:26.950]  Yeah, I just wanted to let you know and ask you a question.
[00:25:29.043 --> 00:25:34.628]  On the Google end game, the view counter is locked down.
[00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:43.815]  Well, Google admits they've deleted our views on TerrorStorm a lot to keep us out of the top 100, and they admit that they've censored us.
[00:25:44.616 --> 00:25:47.758]  It's horrible quality anyways, but I leave it up there for free.
[00:25:47.798 --> 00:25:49.180]  I can take it down if I wanted to.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.341]  Whoever put it up there did a pretty bad encoding.
[00:25:51.401 --> 00:25:54.144]  I'm not knocking them, it just doesn't look good, but Google's low quality.
[00:25:54.604 --> 00:25:58.227]  That's why people should go to PrisonPlanet.tv and download it in super high quality.
[00:25:59.013 --> 00:26:01.934]  That's true, but it just keeps the counter down.
[00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:03.775]  Well, they've done it in the past.
[00:26:03.815 --> 00:26:05.975]  I haven't been watching it.
[00:26:06.716 --> 00:26:09.236]  We know Google and Dig and all of them do what they do.
[00:26:09.937 --> 00:26:11.257]  Okay, I just thought I'd let you know.
[00:26:11.297 --> 00:26:12.297]  No, no, thanks for letting me know.
[00:26:12.377 --> 00:26:12.718]  Thank you.
[00:26:13.798 --> 00:26:15.959]  And G. Edward Griffin.
[00:26:16.359 --> 00:26:17.939]  I was kind of wondering what you think of him.
[00:26:18.719 --> 00:26:19.420]  He's a great guy.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:24.781]  I've interviewed him probably, I don't know, ten times or so over the last ten years.
[00:26:24.901 --> 00:26:26.222]  I interview him about once a year.
[00:26:27.473 --> 00:26:27.833]  Oh, okay.
[00:26:27.873 --> 00:26:29.493]  I didn't know you'd ever had him on your show.
[00:26:29.513 --> 00:26:29.593]  Sure.
[00:26:29.613 --> 00:26:33.054]  Freedom Force International and the Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:26:33.674 --> 00:26:34.074]  Yeah.
[00:26:34.154 --> 00:26:36.155]  Yeah, okay.
[00:26:36.255 --> 00:26:36.595]  Great.
[00:26:36.775 --> 00:26:37.935]  I'm glad to hear that, Alex.
[00:26:38.115 --> 00:26:38.395]  Okay.
[00:26:38.635 --> 00:26:39.275]  Thanks a lot now.
[00:26:39.596 --> 00:26:40.116]  Thank you, Jeff.
[00:26:40.136 --> 00:26:40.976]  Appreciate the call.
[00:26:41.516 --> 00:26:42.536]  Dave in Seattle.
[00:26:42.556 --> 00:26:43.156]  You're on the air.
[00:26:44.277 --> 00:26:44.557]  Hello?
[00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:45.877]  Hi.
[00:26:46.297 --> 00:26:46.577]  Hi.
[00:26:48.297 --> 00:26:49.458]  I had a thought about Hillary.
[00:26:50.958 --> 00:26:56.239]  Do you think that with the swelling of the 9-11 truth, that just before the election,
[00:26:56.943 --> 00:27:04.987]  Hillary might reveal 9-11 to be a Republican operation, and that would enrage the public and wipe out any Republicans.
[00:27:05.787 --> 00:27:07.508]  I don't think she'll go that far.
[00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:14.792]  She's talked about failures of intelligence, failures of Bush, like he screwed up coming to Michael Moore angle of Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:27:15.292 --> 00:27:19.794]  But her administration with her husband was engaged in the attack on the World Trade Center in 93.
[00:27:20.115 --> 00:27:22.996]  That's mainstream news, hidden in plain view.
[00:27:23.356 --> 00:27:24.597]  The Oklahoma City bombing.
[00:27:25.526 --> 00:27:27.688]  Well, they are, but they could pretend to not be for effect.
[00:27:27.708 --> 00:27:27.928]  Oh, I know.
[00:27:54.028 --> 00:28:01.972]  I wanted to add that the words that you spoke at the very beginning this morning, I almost felt like you were talking directly to me.
[00:28:03.173 --> 00:28:22.283]  I've been listening to you for about eight months, really lifelong, in search of somebody to listen to who had their head squarely on their shoulders, who didn't hypothesize but used hard evidence, stuff that was in the news, that the news wires
[00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:25.120]  I'm a little selfish too.
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:33.986]  I realize it's not a fun thing to be on the front line and the big fish right up there with Ron Paul, folks, globally.
[00:28:54.012 --> 00:28:55.253]  I don't think so.
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:44.698]  Uh, kind of to a crazed level to, to, to, you know, to try to push forward against the New World Order and, uh, commit to what I'm doing and, you know, in the process it's, uh, it's a metamorphosis and I am trying to be chastened and trying to be proper and trying to truly be professional and not to just go wild and, uh, it is, uh, something that's very hard to conquer.
[00:29:45.158 --> 00:29:46.239]  Anything else, Dave?
[00:29:47.165 --> 00:29:47.485]  Yeah.
[00:29:47.625 --> 00:29:48.046]  Stay there.
[00:29:48.066 --> 00:29:48.686]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.787 --> 00:29:52.948]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:54.849]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.729 --> 00:29:58.571]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.372 --> 00:30:02.033]  It's a fact.
[00:30:02.253 --> 00:30:09.737]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:30:09.837 --> 00:30:16.220]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:16.380]  I'm good.
[00:30:36.044 --> 00:30:41.069]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:30:41.249 --> 00:30:45.753]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:30:45.914 --> 00:30:47.715]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:30:47.755 --> 00:30:47.936]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:30:47.956 --> 00:30:48.316]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:30:48.356 --> 00:30:49.637]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.

[00:34:06.231 --> 00:34:09.152]  Ain't too many things these old boys can't do.
[00:34:13.789 --> 00:34:16.011]  Because you can't starve us out.

[00:34:44.272 --> 00:34:49.316]  Wide open phones, let's kind of hurry through your calls.
[00:34:49.376 --> 00:34:52.539]  And the western skies.
[00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:56.182]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Seattle, finishing up what he was saying.
[00:34:56.202 --> 00:34:56.722]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:34:56.742 --> 00:34:58.123]  Hi, Alex.
[00:34:58.704 --> 00:35:07.190]  One more point that I wanted to bring out is that now when I read papers, I start from the back because that's where all the important stuff's hidden that you're not supposed to find.
[00:35:08.031 --> 00:35:10.173]  I saw in USA Today about a month ago,
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:21.786]  The French press had an article that said the hole in the ozone layer over the Arctic is 30% smaller now than it was a year ago.
[00:35:21.806 --> 00:35:25.808]  It's been getting smaller, yes.
[00:35:25.828 --> 00:35:28.870]  Well, if carbon dioxide is killing the atmosphere,
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:32.523]  Why is the ozone layer repairing itself?
[00:35:32.843 --> 00:35:52.963]  Well, the truth is there's always holes in the ozone layer over the Antarctic and the Arctic, in the north and the south, because the atmosphere is thinner there, and because you have the coronal winds of the sun that we orbit blasting with higher power over the poles.
[00:35:55.939 --> 00:36:04.510]  Depending on the tilt of the earth and where it is around the sun, it depends on exactly where those holes are and where you see the aurora borealis, but yes.
[00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:05.931]  It's all basic science.
[00:36:06.793 --> 00:36:08.254]  It's all been documented.
[00:36:08.314 --> 00:36:09.376]  It's not even an opinion.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:14.783]  These are laws of science that have been well vetted, but again, the public can't find the U.S.
[00:36:14.823 --> 00:36:21.387]  on a map, so they can tell them that the Easter Bunny ate the ozone layer and the devil demon's gonna get us.
[00:36:21.908 --> 00:36:26.111]  There's no doubt that chemicals and things in the atmosphere are bad and are hurting plants and animals.
[00:36:26.151 --> 00:36:27.411]  We've got environmental crises.
[00:36:27.992 --> 00:36:34.616]  Just the establishment comes in and then sells us on false solutions that have nothing to do with the real problems.
[00:36:36.237 --> 00:36:37.018]  Okay.
[00:36:37.138 --> 00:36:38.819]  In my humble researched opinion.
[00:36:39.446 --> 00:36:40.806]  Okay, thanks for letting me talk to you.
[00:36:40.966 --> 00:36:42.807]  Hey Dave, good to have you listening, God bless you.
[00:36:43.387 --> 00:36:45.507]  Nima in Canada, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:36:45.527 --> 00:36:55.689]  Hi Alex, I'm from Iran and I think two months ago I talked to you, I told you that I just came from Iran.
[00:36:57.370 --> 00:36:59.790]  Yeah, you talked about how it's very modern over there, it looks like New York.
[00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:00.830]  Yeah.
[00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.651]  Everybody else I talk to says that.
[00:37:02.671 --> 00:37:02.751]  Yeah.
[00:37:05.047 --> 00:37:11.471]  And I have a lot of relatives and friends who are in the army and military air force.
[00:37:12.231 --> 00:37:16.874]  And one of my cousins who's serving in the commander unit in the Revolutionary Guard.
[00:37:18.254 --> 00:37:22.657]  And he used to because he was a veteran of the Iran-Iraq War.
[00:37:23.637 --> 00:37:28.440]  And the last time that I talked to him because I'm very worried about my family.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.261]  I have a sick grandmother, you know.
[00:37:30.885 --> 00:37:34.166]  If we go to war, then she's gonna have a heart attack.
[00:37:34.206 --> 00:37:35.006]  She cannot take it.
[00:37:35.766 --> 00:37:38.546]  And so I keep calling Iran to see how's my family is.
[00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:42.687]  And I talked to my cousin who is in the Revolutionary Guard.
[00:37:43.347 --> 00:37:44.608]  He is in a commando unit.
[00:37:44.948 --> 00:37:53.129]  And they are sending him to the south, which is one of the nuclear facilities in Natanz.
[00:37:54.329 --> 00:37:57.630]  And his commanders told him,
[00:37:58.243 --> 00:38:04.105]  That you have to take your unit and go and protect the nuclear facility in Natanz.
[00:38:04.745 --> 00:38:16.970]  He asked his commanders and he was very surprised because usually when you ask the commando unit of the Revolutionary Guard or any military... That means they're expecting ground attack.
[00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:24.653]  They're expecting maybe the American commando unit come and kill everybody in the nuclear plant.
[00:38:25.103 --> 00:38:28.225]  But his commander didn't say for what reason.
[00:38:28.605 --> 00:38:33.688]  He just told him, because he's a veteran of the war too, so he has a lot of experience.
[00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:43.974]  And when he got there, he told me that he cannot believe how well protected the nuclear facility is.
[00:38:44.054 --> 00:38:53.120]  It is surrounded by missiles and secret units, snipers, all over the nuclear plant.
[00:38:53.929 --> 00:38:57.510]  And he's been there in, uh, they sent him last month.
[00:38:58.451 --> 00:39:00.391]  And, uh, he's very worried.
[00:39:00.451 --> 00:39:01.492]  He's extremely worried.
[00:39:01.512 --> 00:39:07.974]  Well, you know, now that they're enriching at those facilities, if they bomb them, it's going to be the equivalent of scores of Chernobyls.
[00:39:08.534 --> 00:39:10.115]  Even mainstream media admits that.
[00:39:10.255 --> 00:39:12.595]  It's, it's absolutely horrible.
[00:39:12.915 --> 00:39:14.256]  And I pray for everybody.
[00:39:14.396 --> 00:39:17.257]  I pray for Americans, Iranians, everybody, that this can be averted.
[00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:32.217]  Meanwhile, Pakistan is a puppet who was given nuclear weapons by this government, admittedly, running around threatening everyone, and that's not a problem, but Iran, eight and a half years away from a nuke, non-deliverable, is supposedly something that has to be attacked right now.
[00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:43.123]  But Alex, the problem is, they think that, unfortunately, I don't know what's happening to the American government, but they think Iran is going to be a cakewalk for them.
[00:39:43.223 --> 00:39:43.804]  I talked to them.
[00:39:44.716 --> 00:39:47.979]  Is the Iranian military ready to defend the country?
[00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:55.127]  He said, not only are we ready, but if we are attacked by Israel or the United States, there is going to be hell to pay.
[00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.400]  I mean, and I said, what do you mean?
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.621]  Is that going to be World War 3?
[00:39:59.661 --> 00:40:01.141]  Look, the government is just stupid.
[00:40:01.201 --> 00:40:01.841]  They know that.
[00:40:01.881 --> 00:40:06.602]  They know there's 11,000 missiles Iran's going to launch at Israel and at the Iraq forces.
[00:40:07.022 --> 00:40:09.123]  They mean to get us into World War 3, sir.
[00:40:09.183 --> 00:40:13.303]  They mean to pick a fight that then will take all of the U.S.'
[00:40:13.263 --> 00:40:14.644]  's energies and then the U.S.
[00:40:14.684 --> 00:40:19.424]  was going to absolutely, and I know that over a million and a half Iranians fought when the U.S.
[00:40:19.444 --> 00:40:22.385]  funded Saddam to attack you for no reason, a great evil.
[00:40:23.005 --> 00:40:26.529]  I understand all that, but I'm not here who's going to win, who's going to lose.
[00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:28.390]  We all lose in this.
[00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:34.116]  And the New World Order will beat Iran, but their main target is going to be beating the U.S.
[00:40:34.156 --> 00:40:35.477]  and bringing us into a police state.
[00:40:35.497 --> 00:40:36.017]  You understand?
[00:40:36.438 --> 00:40:37.739]  Chess was invented in your country.
[00:40:37.939 --> 00:40:38.900]  You understand that, don't you?
[00:40:39.561 --> 00:40:40.562]  Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[00:40:40.702 --> 00:40:42.023]  I've been listening to you, sir.
[00:40:42.744 --> 00:40:48.369]  I have most of my information from you, and I told you... Iraq is just a pretext to get the chess pieces over there, sir.
[00:40:49.071 --> 00:40:50.532]  They mean it to be a bloody fight.
[00:40:50.552 --> 00:40:52.873]  They know the Persians are going to go absolutely ape.
[00:40:53.854 --> 00:40:56.535]  Because Iran is a very independent country.
[00:40:56.555 --> 00:40:58.816]  And 66 million, it's not 20 million like Iraq.
[00:40:59.537 --> 00:41:03.319]  And they have a better military tradition than the Arabs.
[00:41:03.759 --> 00:41:05.980]  I know it's a completely different animal.
[00:41:06.601 --> 00:41:10.403]  And believe me, the war planners know all that.
[00:41:10.503 --> 00:41:11.683]  It's complete wickedness.
[00:41:11.763 --> 00:41:13.404]  It's called order out of chaos.
[00:41:15.265 --> 00:41:16.686]  And one more thing, Alex.
[00:41:17.426 --> 00:41:25.049]  He told me that the Iranian government offered the Israeli government truce.
[00:41:25.129 --> 00:41:30.371]  They were even willing to not support Hamas and Hezbollah.
[00:41:30.451 --> 00:41:31.491]  That's been public.
[00:41:31.831 --> 00:41:33.012]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:33.192 --> 00:41:38.694]  And he said that no Israel or United States accepted the deal.
[00:41:39.281 --> 00:41:45.548]  So what he means is that we're going to a war whether, you know, we want it or not.
[00:41:45.688 --> 00:41:47.690]  And we don't have a choice but to defend the country.
[00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:51.174]  So it's unfortunate, but that's the reality.
[00:41:51.841 --> 00:41:57.903]  Well, they've also, Bush has congressional authorization, semi, he says he has it, to attack terrorist forces.
[00:41:57.963 --> 00:42:10.806]  So by designating the Revolutionary Commando Units, all 100,000 of them, as terrorists, they get to hit thousands of targets in Iran, and Cy Hirsch almost four years ago put out the documents, the White House admits are authentic.
[00:42:11.326 --> 00:42:14.467]  He was very upset, he was very upset about that, because
[00:42:14.827 --> 00:42:17.849]  He fought Iran-Iraq War for eight years.
[00:42:18.270 --> 00:42:21.732]  He volunteered, he joined the army, volunteered.
[00:42:21.772 --> 00:42:26.375]  I know, very valiant human wave attacks against more sophisticated military forces.
[00:42:27.016 --> 00:42:30.318]  Yeah, yeah, so he was very upset they portrayed him as terrorist.
[00:42:30.358 --> 00:42:33.600]  He said, we are defending our country and they tell us we are terrorists?
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:39.444]  Well, Americans don't know that our government overthrew the western train Mohamed Mosaddegh by staging terror attacks and blaming it on him.
[00:42:39.744 --> 00:42:41.966]  They don't know they put Savakian and tortured 300,000 Iranians to death.
[00:42:43.607 --> 00:42:47.550]  They don't know that British Petroleum openly claimed they owned Iran.
[00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:49.411]  They don't know that the U.S.
[00:42:49.651 --> 00:43:02.239]  criminals, and that's the criminals in our government, not our country, funded 30 plus billion dollars and ordered Saddam to launch the attacks and CIA advisors were there running the entire operation and a million and a half of your soldiers were killed.
[00:43:02.899 --> 00:43:04.560]  Americans can't find you on a map.
[00:43:04.821 --> 00:43:08.323]  All they know how to do is suck their thumbs and act cool and watch Dog on TV.
[00:43:09.378 --> 00:43:10.139]  Okay, that's why.
[00:43:10.719 --> 00:43:26.573]  We've gone from the most intelligent, highest test scores, the most patents, a good Christian, strong nation, who literally built the greatest country in history, into just mindless idiots, sir, and now they're going to be punished, and all of us are going to be punished along with it.
[00:43:27.013 --> 00:43:31.637]  And all the sins that we've committed, the 50 million abortions, all of it are going to come back on us.
[00:43:33.345 --> 00:43:39.049]  Yeah, I tried to tell my family and most Iranians that there are people like you out there.
[00:43:39.089 --> 00:44:01.006]  I keep telling my friends who are in Iran, I'm listening to this guy, he's from the United States, his name is Alex Jones, and he's a patriot, he talks about human life as important, not just American, but everybody, you know, not all Americans are like what you see on TV, George Bush, and people like that.
[00:44:01.066 --> 00:44:03.068]  There are people in the United States who are
[00:44:03.567 --> 00:44:06.530]  Fighting for their Constitution and their Republic.
[00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:16.379]  And they are very happy that there are people like you that are defending not just your country, but you're defending their humanity.
[00:44:16.419 --> 00:44:18.401]  That's why you're international.
[00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:23.726]  That's why everybody loves to listen to you, because of your humanity.
[00:44:24.813 --> 00:44:26.694]  I don't think Americans realize
[00:44:43.206 --> 00:44:45.527]  How restrained Iran has been.
[00:44:45.547 --> 00:44:47.568]  I mean, can they imagine that the U.S.
[00:44:47.588 --> 00:44:49.208]  had been overthrown by a foreign power?
[00:44:49.849 --> 00:44:54.751]  Had had puppets put in, who literally tortured at least 300,000 people to death.
[00:44:55.991 --> 00:44:57.572]  Who literally did whatever they wanted.
[00:44:57.712 --> 00:44:58.872]  Raping women in the streets.
[00:44:58.952 --> 00:45:00.733]  Just an absolute hell.
[00:45:01.013 --> 00:45:02.594]  Why don't you tell people what Savak did?
[00:45:02.614 --> 00:45:04.775]  Oh, they know.
[00:45:04.815 --> 00:45:05.795]  They know about Savak.
[00:45:06.215 --> 00:45:08.096]  I mean... The American people don't know.
[00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:10.306]  Oh, the SAVAK.
[00:45:10.466 --> 00:45:22.810]  The SAVAK was the Shah's secret police, which tortured and they were actually trained by CIA and British intelligence forces.
[00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:33.153]  And they used to rape women, you know, torture political prisoners, like so many terrible things.
[00:45:33.233 --> 00:45:37.534]  And back then I was a kid and my grandfather, you know, used to tell me about these guys, you know.
[00:45:38.081 --> 00:45:46.084]  And that's why there was a revolution, that's how the Islamic Republic came to power, because of Shah and his secret police.
[00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:55.087]  And most Iranians, even though most Iranians are against the government, Ahmadinejad and everybody, but they hate
[00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:57.709]  Uh, you know, opposition.
[00:45:57.729 --> 00:46:07.195]  Well, that's the other point is that, uh, there was a moderate who let the IAEA, the UN admitted no one had ever given this much access, total access, done everything.
[00:46:07.475 --> 00:46:11.418]  They said, just suspended a few years, let us do all these checks and you can go ahead with your peaceful system.
[00:46:11.998 --> 00:46:14.080]  And then they said, okay, now we're withdrawing that.
[00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:18.262]  And so the people got mad and put Ahmedinejad into power.
[00:46:18.783 --> 00:46:22.545]  And now in the polls, 60% don't like him, but most of them are young and can't vote.
[00:46:23.334 --> 00:46:23.755]  We're good to go.
[00:46:33.755 --> 00:46:39.577]  Bush and the New World Order in Israel threatening to attack has made him wildly popular and given him the support.
[00:46:39.617 --> 00:46:40.677]  And that's a fact.
[00:46:40.717 --> 00:46:43.278]  That's not even debated even by the neocons.
[00:46:43.998 --> 00:46:45.459]  Again, they're spreading this.
[00:46:45.959 --> 00:46:55.422]  Meanwhile, right next to you is Pakistan with 50-something nukes, medium-range missiles, can hit Europe, running around threatening to nuke everybody on the verge of being toppled.
[00:46:55.642 --> 00:46:56.842]  But that's not a problem!
[00:46:57.102 --> 00:47:01.926]  No, the plan is go in there, stir the Muslim fanatics up, get them to bring Pakistan down.
[00:47:02.186 --> 00:47:05.949]  Oh my gosh, the nukes are in the hands of the... and now we gotta go in.
[00:47:06.509 --> 00:47:09.051]  They're just setting... they're setting up World War III.
[00:47:09.071 --> 00:47:18.058]  They're setting up a fight that America has to go into, and they're doing it with these dominoes that are Iran and Iraq.
[00:47:18.658 --> 00:47:22.141]  But it's all about... But Alex, the thing is, Iran...
[00:47:22.867 --> 00:47:34.716]  Believe it or not, Iran is the only Muslim country in the world who majority of Iranian people, not the government, majority of Iranians are pro-American.
[00:47:35.056 --> 00:47:39.880]  When you watch Iranian TV programs or Iranian movies and everything,
[00:47:40.529 --> 00:47:43.891]  They watch more American movies or listen to American music.
[00:47:43.991 --> 00:47:44.491]  No, no.
[00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:46.232]  Americans don't know that, though, sir.
[00:47:46.592 --> 00:47:47.812]  They think you're Arabs.
[00:47:48.093 --> 00:47:48.973]  They don't know anything.
[00:47:49.453 --> 00:47:52.174]  They think that Iran is ruled by Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:52.795 --> 00:47:54.936]  What's the difference between a Shiite and a Sunni?
[00:47:56.356 --> 00:47:59.418]  Well, there's a huge difference between Shiite and Sunni.
[00:47:59.918 --> 00:48:01.659]  Even though I'm not a religious guy, but...
[00:48:03.134 --> 00:48:10.076]  Shia, we believe, actually 13 Imams, which the Sunni don't believe.
[00:48:10.096 --> 00:48:15.758]  They think that you only believe in Prophet Muhammad, and that's it, you know.
[00:48:16.558 --> 00:48:18.338]  And we believe Imam Ali.
[00:48:18.459 --> 00:48:21.779]  Imam Ali is the cousin of Prophet Muhammad.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:26.621]  And, you know, the Sunni says Ali, he's not an Imam.
[00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:33.153]  Throughout the history, the Shia and Sunni, they fought against their different beliefs.
[00:48:33.513 --> 00:48:40.177]  Actually, Iran fought against Arabs throughout the history than any other Western countries combined.
[00:48:41.097 --> 00:48:45.460]  So, we are the weak... I know, I know, but see, the average American thinks you're Arab, A.
[00:48:46.793 --> 00:48:48.994]  Yeah, it's pissing me off when I read that.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:10.907]  Oh, by the way, we're using these five groups that are Wahhabi in the east of Iraq, west of Iran, to attack the Iranians.
[00:49:11.287 --> 00:49:14.210]  They're carrying out terror attacks, and the White House says they're behind it.
[00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:17.172]  And then you go look, and it's actually real Al-Qaeda!
[00:49:17.773 --> 00:49:19.614]  Al-Qaeda, it works for the U.S.
[00:49:20.035 --> 00:49:23.918]  and the New World Order, attacking Iran, and then they call Iran Al-Qaeda!
[00:49:24.599 --> 00:49:27.021]  I mean, again, that's how dumb they think you are, America!
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.282]  Alex, in 1999, Iranian army...
[00:49:33.445 --> 00:49:37.386]  Almost went to war against Afghanistan and Taliban.
[00:49:37.406 --> 00:49:38.847]  I don't know if you guys knew about that.
[00:49:39.167 --> 00:49:39.847]  No, I know that.
[00:49:39.887 --> 00:49:49.610]  And then the President of Afghanistan, Bush, in a press conference says that Iran is helping the Taliban.
[00:49:50.271 --> 00:49:57.353]  And of course, the President of Afghanistan, put in by Bush, knows how ridiculous that is to his audience.
[00:49:57.433 --> 00:50:00.434]  I mean, that is like saying Ronald Reagan is Bill Clinton.
[00:50:01.094 --> 00:50:01.774]  Yeah, I know.
[00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:04.735]  I mean, they went almost to the war, like full-scale war.
[00:50:04.755 --> 00:50:10.656]  But Bush knows the American people literally don't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[00:50:29.887 --> 00:50:41.675]  That's the key to all this, is that Iran is fighting Al-Qaeda, they've always fought Al-Qaeda, and that's why Al-Qaeda attacks Iran, because Al-Qaeda works and was founded by the New World Order.
[00:50:42.436 --> 00:50:44.117]  You just cannot explain this to people.
[00:50:44.177 --> 00:50:45.998]  Now they're saying Iran's behind 9-11.
[00:50:46.459 --> 00:50:47.800]  They said Iraq was behind 9-11.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:49.080]  Iraq was secular.
[00:50:49.761 --> 00:50:51.422]  Alright, we'll be, thank you for the call.
[00:50:51.462 --> 00:50:52.042]  Appreciate it.
[00:50:53.584 --> 00:50:53.944]  Tristan,
[00:50:55.499 --> 00:50:56.720]  Maggie, John, others.
[00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.720]  Your calls are up next.
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:00.521]  Then Larry Pratt with important gun news.
[00:51:01.981 --> 00:51:03.402]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.422 --> 00:51:05.523]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.223 --> 00:51:10.545]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:11.125 --> 00:51:14.006]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:14.026 --> 00:51:16.207]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[00:51:16.747 --> 00:51:19.128]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.904 --> 00:51:27.250]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.262 --> 00:51:35.566]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.726 --> 00:51:39.228]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.568 --> 00:51:42.110]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:43.291]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.331 --> 00:51:44.091]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.111 --> 00:51:45.152]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.372 --> 00:51:46.153]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.373 --> 00:51:47.233]  That's what happens here.
[00:51:47.514 --> 00:51:52.057]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:51:56.199 --> 00:51:58.981]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:59.021 --> 00:52:00.082]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.203 --> 00:52:04.385]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:04.425 --> 00:52:08.447]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:08.587 --> 00:52:11.149]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:11.209 --> 00:52:13.550]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:22.176]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:22.236 --> 00:52:23.576]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:52:23.697 --> 00:52:27.739]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.739 --> 00:52:28.199]  We're good to go!
[00:52:48.097 --> 00:52:51.159]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.

[00:53:54.411 --> 00:54:08.334]  Alright, I'm going to tell you about a couple sponsors and continue your calls for this segment into the next.
[00:54:08.794 --> 00:54:13.875]  The United Nations may be given jurisdiction over the Second Amendment and ammo, that's Gun Owners of America.
[00:54:15.117 --> 00:54:17.238]  This is actually happening, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:17.619 --> 00:54:25.743]  They've already been given control of continuity of government inside the continental U.S., Puerto Rico, Guam, Hawaii, Alaska.
[00:54:27.044 --> 00:54:34.028]  The Communist Chinese have been given the Panama Canal, as you know, and much of the oil supplies in the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:54:35.169 --> 00:54:36.790]  Total encirclement intensifies.
[00:54:38.718 --> 00:54:39.138]  All right.
[00:54:39.278 --> 00:54:40.539]  Meanwhile, we're worried about Iran.
[00:54:40.559 --> 00:54:44.180]  It's been nothing but beaten to death by the wicked people that control our nation.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.260]  They're now feasting on us.
[00:54:47.421 --> 00:54:48.701]  My friends, listen carefully.
[00:54:48.741 --> 00:54:50.482]  They want to use food as a weapon against us.
[00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:53.582]  And they will use it as a weapon.
[00:54:53.602 --> 00:54:56.163]  You need to have storable food for recession, depression.
[00:54:56.683 --> 00:54:58.744]  It's a way to get high-quality freeze-dried foods.
[00:54:58.764 --> 00:55:01.765]  You can supplement your food as food prices spiral out of control.

[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:36.151]  Also, I wanted to tell you about the Freedom Law School that is coming up on the 16th, 17th, and 18th in Dallas, Texas at the Crowne Plaza North Dallas Hotel.
[00:55:36.652 --> 00:55:39.876]  Call and get your tickets for this amazing three-day event at 972-980-8877.
[00:55:39.916 --> 00:55:41.237]  They have sold out before.
[00:55:46.929 --> 00:55:48.230]  Very professional events.
[00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:48.931]  Very well done.
[00:55:48.951 --> 00:56:01.822]  William Rodriguez, Tommy Cryer, Larry Becraft, Davon Clice, Jason Bermas, Ted Gunderson, Mark Anderson, G. Edward Griffin, Robert Lawrence, Joe Bannister, many, many others, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:02.509 --> 00:56:03.910]  Hey Alex, it's a pleasure and an honor.
[00:56:28.436 --> 00:56:32.018]  First, I have a thing regarding one of your sponsors, Decal Benz Soaps.
[00:56:32.158 --> 00:56:34.900]  I actually ordered one of the big packages, and they are great.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:36.141]  They are phenomenal.
[00:56:36.221 --> 00:56:36.701]  Organic?
[00:56:37.282 --> 00:56:39.683]  Yes, organic.
[00:56:39.703 --> 00:56:43.105]  Organic soaps, the 1300, whatever it is.
[00:56:43.185 --> 00:56:46.647]  I bought it at about $130 US, plus the exchange.
[00:56:47.088 --> 00:56:47.548]  It is great.
[00:56:47.608 --> 00:56:49.429]  It's really soft on the skin.
[00:56:49.529 --> 00:56:50.450]  It's phenomenal.
[00:56:50.670 --> 00:56:51.931]  You've got a big supply of it.
[00:56:52.191 --> 00:56:54.632]  Yeah, I bought the whole thing, the whole package.
[00:56:54.772 --> 00:56:55.773]  Honestly, it would make
[00:56:56.331 --> 00:56:57.912]  It would make sense to buy it if you're in the U.S.
[00:56:57.932 --> 00:57:01.433]  because you don't have all the brokerage fees coming through UPS shipping.
[00:57:02.373 --> 00:57:04.114]  It's honestly a no-brainer to buy it.
[00:57:04.214 --> 00:57:05.234]  It's great, great stuff.
[00:57:06.314 --> 00:57:10.616]  I was recently in Regina talking about the cameras and all that, the big brother.
[00:57:11.836 --> 00:57:19.359]  Basically, I traveled to Regina and I noticed that almost every intersection, the lights had cameras hanging down at every angle.
[00:57:20.199 --> 00:57:22.180]  And this is a smaller town than Montreal.
[00:57:22.220 --> 00:57:23.020]  It's about maybe
[00:57:23.797 --> 00:57:25.198]  It's ridiculous.
[00:57:47.813 --> 00:57:49.014]  Did you guys realize there's cameras?
[00:57:49.074 --> 00:57:50.414]  Oh, it's for emergencies.
[00:57:50.514 --> 00:57:52.635]  What emergencies would they have them there for?
[00:57:52.955 --> 00:57:53.776]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:57:54.136 --> 00:57:55.056]  From Iran!
[00:57:55.076 --> 00:57:57.737]  Yeah, it's terrible what's going on.
[00:57:58.238 --> 00:57:59.698]  I listened to your radio show yesterday.
[00:57:59.718 --> 00:58:01.839]  You were talking about the Pakistani shootings.
[00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.280]  What ended up happening?
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:14.265]  Was that something that... No, it was just people shooting some other people, and they never said what it was, but it's admitted mass killing and torture and murder, and he's declared himself Supreme Dictator.
[00:58:15.583 --> 00:58:16.344]  It's unreal.
[00:58:16.764 --> 00:58:22.648]  It's really, it's sad because people are so disillusioned, the main public is so disillusioned that, oh, it's not happening.
[00:58:22.688 --> 00:58:26.690]  And if you tell them this, they're like, yeah, whatever, you're out of your mind or something.
[00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:28.532]  But all the information is out there.
[00:58:29.092 --> 00:58:31.393]  The New World Order, Tristan, thank you for the call.
[00:58:31.413 --> 00:58:32.434]  Call me back next week.
[00:58:32.454 --> 00:58:33.555]  We have more time on this Sunday, 4 to 6.
[00:58:33.675 --> 00:58:36.096]  We're going to take a few more calls and get Larry Pratt on.
[00:58:36.217 --> 00:58:37.497]  Big Second Amendment news.
[00:58:37.517 --> 00:58:38.298]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:42.990 --> 00:58:45.835]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:46.235 --> 00:58:48.459]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.483 --> 00:59:01.685]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.325 --> 00:59:03.165]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.885 --> 00:59:04.826]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.466 --> 00:59:09.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.648 --> 00:59:13.729]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.001 --> 00:59:30.144]  Larry Pratt, ladies and gentlemen, will be joining us in the next segment with unbelievably important news.
[00:59:30.264 --> 00:59:33.445]  The globalists, the New World Order, are making their move right now.
[00:59:34.666 --> 00:59:37.407]  At the state level, the federal level, the international level.
[00:59:38.287 --> 00:59:44.951]  And I know I'm like, this is an emergency with the dollar, this is an emergency with the open borders, this is an emergency with the Second Amendment.
[00:59:45.071 --> 00:59:45.511]  It is.
[00:59:46.596 --> 00:59:50.080]  And if you lose it, it's ten times harder to get it back than to stop them from getting it.
[00:59:50.641 --> 00:59:53.024]  Call everybody you know who cares about the Second Amendment right now.
[00:59:53.284 --> 00:59:54.285]  Tune in the next five minutes.
[00:59:54.305 --> 01:00:01.213]  You're going to hear Larry Pratt from GunOwners.org, the second biggest gun group in this country, the only real national group.
[01:00:01.754 --> 01:00:04.317]  The NRA are the founders of modern gun control.
[01:00:04.357 --> 01:00:05.258]  That's a historical fact.
[01:00:06.738 --> 01:00:08.419]  I know you can't believe it, but we've proven it here.
[01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:12.621]  Let's go ahead and jam some calls in before Gloria Pratt joins us.
[01:00:13.221 --> 01:00:15.182]  Maggie in Texas, and then John in Missouri.
[01:00:15.202 --> 01:00:15.802]  Go ahead, Maggie.
[01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:17.023]  Yes, Alex.
[01:00:17.203 --> 01:00:26.768]  The other night, Jim Lehrer spoke on campus, and in his talk he actually bragged about the mainstream media's role as gatekeeper, with words like,
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:33.181]  Americans are too busy to decide what's important and what's not so important, so we do that for them.
[01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:36.002]  And we have a responsibility to tell them what to think.
[01:00:36.062 --> 01:00:37.622]  Our role is very important.
[01:00:38.683 --> 01:00:40.563]  And he went on like that.
[01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:53.046]  So, there was a Q&A session, and I asked him the question, did he not think it's possible that the flipping listenership and readership
[01:00:53.647 --> 01:01:07.838]  of the mainstream media might be related to a disconnect between what the gatekeepers thought was important and what the public thought was important and I gave quickly as an example the Ron Paul campaign.
[01:01:08.338 --> 01:01:19.166]  Well he didn't like that question very much and he hastened to put on the record that they had given Ron Paul a whole 20 minute interview but as to the rest of it he simply said
[01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:22.119]  There's an awful lot of stuff out there.
[01:01:22.139 --> 01:01:23.700]  Someone's got to sort it out.
[01:01:24.861 --> 01:01:27.303]  We're paid to make judgments, and that's what we do.
[01:01:27.744 --> 01:01:32.427]  We sort it out for you and tell you that the Shiite is Sunni.
[01:01:33.048 --> 01:01:35.130]  We tell you Iranians are Arabs.
[01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:37.712]  We tell you the Easter Bunny is real.
[01:01:39.139 --> 01:01:40.640]  Well, Laird's better than a lot of them.
[01:01:40.660 --> 01:01:45.144]  He's had... I mean, he's done some great reports in the past, but it's still kind of liberal establishment.
[01:01:46.085 --> 01:01:50.989]  But, I mean, he's one of the few, really, journalists I've seen do some good work, but he's still a gatekeeper.
[01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:51.750]  Right.
[01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:53.852]  He is a gatekeeper and very proud of it.
[01:01:54.012 --> 01:01:54.812]  Where did you see him?
[01:01:55.653 --> 01:02:01.298]  He spoke on the UT campus in Jessup Auditorium, and I recorded that lecture.
[01:02:02.239 --> 01:02:04.981]  And I've also written an article about it.
[01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:06.362]  Does any of that interest you?
[01:02:06.502 --> 01:02:07.343]  Oh, where is the article?
[01:02:07.859 --> 01:02:10.240]  I sent it to Aaron's email.
[01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:11.881]  Oh, we will get Aaron to post it.
[01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:15.122]  Aaron's running around like a busy bee doing people's jobs.
[01:02:15.502 --> 01:02:31.089]  I figured you'd probably get thousands of emails a day, but I did send that in, and I can put the speech, which was rather long, on a CD, but I can indicate where the quotes are if that interests you at all.
[01:02:31.649 --> 01:02:32.329]  Absolutely.
[01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:36.211]  We're going to get it up, and thank you so much for the call, Maggie.
[01:02:37.834 --> 01:02:41.717]  Absolutely, there's so many wonderful listeners that do so much great work out there.
[01:02:41.817 --> 01:02:43.398]  John in Missouri, I've got a minute and a half, go ahead.
[01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:45.779]  Okay, I have one question.
[01:02:46.119 --> 01:02:53.284]  You know how when they declared martial law in Afghanistan, I mean Pakistan?
[01:02:54.051 --> 01:02:56.792]  And they took over the radio stations and TV stations.
[01:02:57.392 --> 01:03:05.494]  If something was to happen, like let's say in Kansas City and Bush declares martial law, will he do that in Kansas City?
[01:03:05.654 --> 01:03:07.774]  Well, he won't even have to physically send people there.
[01:03:07.794 --> 01:03:15.316]  By law, at the transmitter site and in the control rooms at the stations, everything is wired through.
[01:03:16.237 --> 01:03:18.739]  Uh, these EAS boxes since 1997.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:24.826]  Before that, you would tune an emergency channel and broadcast what they told you to do, but now they've taken physical control.
[01:03:25.267 --> 01:03:35.738]  It would take hours to rewire it, even if you could take control of it, to be able to transmit FEMA via satellite and via powerful shortwave transmitters all over the country.
[01:03:36.739 --> 01:03:37.380]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:37.980]  A new world order.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.404]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a new world order.
[01:04:02.862 --> 01:04:04.583]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:04:05.683 --> 01:04:07.924]  Both their objectives being world domination.
[01:04:08.464 --> 01:04:10.925]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.645 --> 01:04:19.007]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.006 --> 01:04:26.969]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.450 --> 01:04:30.932]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.312 --> 01:04:33.834]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:33.874 --> 01:04:35.035]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.055 --> 01:04:35.755]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.775 --> 01:04:36.896]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.116 --> 01:04:37.837]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.097 --> 01:04:39.097]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:05:52.806 --> 01:05:54.647]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:05:54.787 --> 01:05:59.969]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:06:00.149 --> 01:06:01.489]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:09.933]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[01:06:20.179 --> 01:06:24.443]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:06:24.603 --> 01:06:26.765]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:06:26.825 --> 01:06:34.713]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[01:06:41.716 --> 01:06:45.237]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.993 --> 01:07:20.780]  The easiest way to find it is to go up to Infowars.com and there's a big banner of a handgun tied in a knot that they have at the United Nations made of melted down small arms they seized from their victims before they killed them in Africa, literally.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.301]  They've done that over and over again.
[01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:27.503]  That's what they make these blasphemous monuments and sigments of wickedness out of.
[01:07:27.923 --> 01:07:30.824]  And it links to their latest legislative alert.
[01:07:30.844 --> 01:07:32.525]  Well, there's quite a few of them.
[01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:36.574]  And, uh, here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:37.495 --> 01:07:40.280]  Senate considering treaty that could affect gun rights.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:44.206]  Ask your senators to support the Second Amendment Protection Amendment.
[01:07:44.858 --> 01:07:52.324]  It turns out Washington may soon be giving an arm of the United Nations jurisdiction over the import, export, and oceanic transport of guns and ammunition.
[01:07:52.644 --> 01:07:54.206]  And I've read the law of the Sea Treaty.
[01:07:54.226 --> 01:07:56.407]  We've had experts on about it.
[01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.069]  Reagan said no to it.
[01:07:59.089 --> 01:08:01.952]  Bush is trying to say yes to it right now, along with the Democrats.
[01:08:02.552 --> 01:08:03.413]  And it gives the U.N.
[01:08:03.453 --> 01:08:08.377]  control of 73% of the Earth's surface, the salt water, and the inland ports.
[01:08:08.977 --> 01:08:15.742]  And it's in the bill, and it's over global tax on ships, funding, control, so it's a global tax bad right there.
[01:08:16.342 --> 01:08:35.174]  And remember, in July 4th of 2000, the Univere Small Arms Conference in New York, and I've read these quotes many times on air, the UN said that civilian ownership of firearms in the western world and in the third and second world threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:08:35.575 --> 01:08:37.596]  Power monopoly of the state means dictatorship.
[01:08:38.464 --> 01:08:42.686]  Perez Musharraf over in Pakistan has a power monopoly.
[01:08:43.486 --> 01:08:45.867]  The state has a power monopoly over there.
[01:08:45.907 --> 01:08:46.828]  That is dictatorship.
[01:08:46.848 --> 01:08:48.008]  The only thing I disagree with in the U.N.
[01:08:48.028 --> 01:08:49.029]  statement is legitimate.
[01:08:49.069 --> 01:08:49.709]  It's illegitimate.
[01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:52.210]  And so, this is what's happening.
[01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:54.371]  And there's other legislative updates.
[01:08:54.791 --> 01:09:06.577]  Schwarzenegger has, of course, passed a bill that will make all the guns that are sold in the 7th largest economy in the world automatically stamp on the bullet casing
[01:09:08.365 --> 01:09:15.792]  The serial number of where that ammo was brought to track and trace you, that will further bankrupt gun makers as they claim that they can't allow them to be in the state.
[01:09:16.593 --> 01:09:18.875]  We've got all these governors suing Republican and Democrat.
[01:09:19.636 --> 01:09:26.422]  The gun manufacturers are going bankrupt on a monthly basis from lawsuits just offending them as they use our tax money to sue them ad infinitum.
[01:09:27.303 --> 01:09:30.286]  We have other federal bills to restrict police and
[01:09:30.786 --> 01:09:31.227]  I don't know.
[01:09:47.552 --> 01:09:50.375]  And gunowners.org is the website.
[01:09:50.455 --> 01:09:50.916]  Go there.
[01:09:51.056 --> 01:09:52.197]  Read the updates daily.
[01:09:52.457 --> 01:09:53.839]  Defend the Second Amendment.
[01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:55.360]  See, the globalists have gotten slick.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:10:00.906]  They've gotten very good at just not announcing what they're doing, not having a national debate, not have Barbara Boxer go out and give speeches.
[01:10:01.226 --> 01:10:04.249]  They just do it, and we're in dire straits right now.
[01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:05.991]  Larry Pratt, thank you for coming on.
[01:10:06.311 --> 01:10:09.535]  Alex, I appreciate very much the chance to be on this treaty.
[01:10:10.462 --> 01:10:39.144]  is really a desperate fight that we are in because I don't think we have yet 34 votes that would be necessary to kill the thing and one of the reasons the main reason why we're going for an amendment strategy is the to amend the treaty means the treaty would have to be renegotiated and this treaty has been kicking around for over 20 years I guess close to 25 and a lot of countries have signed on to this treaty
[01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:47.882]  And they would then be faced with the idea, well, do they really want to try to tie the United States down under the United Nations?
[01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:55.408]  And do they really want to tell us about how we have to have gun control so bad that they would renegotiate it themselves?
[01:10:55.949 --> 01:10:57.530]  My guess is they don't.
[01:10:58.251 --> 01:11:00.713]  That's why this is a killer amendment.
[01:11:00.953 --> 01:11:08.959]  And if the amendment is brought up on the floor, we probably would get even a majority voting on the amendment.
[01:11:09.591 --> 01:11:14.594]  Well, once we've done that, I kind of suspect the leadership would pull the treaty down.
[01:11:15.115 --> 01:11:16.316]  Now you're doing something big here.
[01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.598]  Already one of the houses of Congress has passed laws.
[01:11:20.347 --> 01:11:27.190]  Well, this thing's out of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and all it needs is that final vote.
[01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:30.991]  If it gets 67 senators, then we're toast.
[01:11:31.091 --> 01:11:38.774]  Because this thing, and I'm sure from what you said, if you've had experts on, they've pointed out that this is the real deal.
[01:11:38.874 --> 01:11:42.875]  This is world government without being called world government.
[01:11:43.016 --> 01:11:44.016]  Let me just stop you.
[01:11:44.036 --> 01:11:45.336]  Can you boost his audio, guys?
[01:11:46.117 --> 01:11:46.577]  Go ahead, Larry.
[01:11:47.218 --> 01:11:49.242]  I can do a little bit of that on my end as well.
[01:11:49.262 --> 01:11:51.166]  Let's see if that helps you a little bit.
[01:11:51.667 --> 01:11:53.130]  Maybe a little too much, Larry, but that's okay.
[01:11:53.150 --> 01:11:53.831]  We'll do it on our end.
[01:11:53.871 --> 01:11:54.192]  Go ahead.
[01:11:54.553 --> 01:11:55.454]  Okay.
[01:11:55.695 --> 01:11:57.939]  So what they've got in this treaty is a
[01:11:58.718 --> 01:11:59.378]  is a tax.
[01:11:59.518 --> 01:12:07.022]  Now, this is not like the normal quote-unquote contribution that the United States sends up every year, about 25% of their budget.
[01:12:07.983 --> 01:12:11.124]  This would be something that would just happen automatically.
[01:12:11.164 --> 01:12:12.045]  You mentioned shipping.
[01:12:12.425 --> 01:12:19.869]  If somebody wants to get a concession to mine or to drill for oil or something of that sort, again, the tax is put on.
[01:12:20.409 --> 01:12:23.531]  They would then have a stream of income
[01:12:24.207 --> 01:12:32.150]  That would not depend on an unhappy Congress possibly cutting off some or all of the UN money from the United States.
[01:12:32.691 --> 01:12:37.913]  They would have a predictable amount of income all the time, which they would then use.
[01:12:38.953 --> 01:12:41.834]  I know this is a news flash for you and your listeners.
[01:12:42.175 --> 01:12:45.116]  They would use it for a UN armed force.
[01:12:45.516 --> 01:12:51.258]  They would become, in terms of what the word sovereignty means, they would become a sovereign.
[01:12:51.358 --> 01:12:52.479]  And their new stratagem
[01:12:53.374 --> 01:12:53.655]  Yes.
[01:13:11.118 --> 01:13:11.358]  We're good.
[01:13:33.767 --> 01:13:38.511]  As bizarre as that may sound to some people, you have to consider what the UN has been doing for more than a decade.
[01:13:50.965 --> 01:14:11.134]  Conferences and meetings and attempts at treaties to get the United States to overtly agree to gun control within the United States and that was blocked and the more I look into what was going on in the State Department at the time that John Bolton was there, the more I realized that
[01:14:11.856 --> 01:14:19.059]  He did it over their dead body, because the State Department, as you know, has never been the United States State Department.
[01:14:19.119 --> 01:14:20.559]  They seem to be the U.N.'
[01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.840]  's State Department.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.640]  Well, that's because our government founded the U.N.
[01:14:23.661 --> 01:14:24.741]  with the big British banks.
[01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:26.221]  That's all in their own founding documents.
[01:14:26.281 --> 01:14:28.242]  It's meant to be a global imperium.
[01:14:28.442 --> 01:14:35.885]  They want to set up new systems to abolish old Magna Carta, Bill of Rights, and other governmental systems that have more liberty.
[01:14:36.185 --> 01:14:40.907]  You know, I mean, a lot of liberals well-meaningly think, well, the next phase is just global government, like Star Trek or something.
[01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:46.008]  But the point is, whether you're for global government or not, I'm against it, because anything centralized will always be taken over.
[01:14:46.428 --> 01:15:05.571]  From the beginning, they're setting it up to be tyrannical and centralized, and this just gives more and more power over trade, over armaments, to the United Nations, and in Article 29 and 30 of the Declaration of Human Rights, they clearly state that we have no rights after listing all these rights that we supposedly have.
[01:15:05.651 --> 01:15:08.872]  Listeners, I've been getting Larry on once a month because
[01:15:09.984 --> 01:15:16.208]  I know the Second Amendment is under attack like it never before, and the NRA is supporting this new huge gun bill.
[01:15:16.228 --> 01:15:17.389]  Give us an update on that, Larry.
[01:15:17.729 --> 01:15:18.890]  But I'm going to put the call out now.
[01:15:19.670 --> 01:15:21.031]  It's time to stop playing games.
[01:15:21.051 --> 01:15:24.973]  We raised $4.2 million for Ron Paul earlier this week.
[01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.875]  We need to get more aggressive for the Second Amendment.
[01:15:27.895 --> 01:15:31.678]  We need to realize the NRA are the fathers of gun control, literally, in this country.
[01:15:32.298 --> 01:15:34.559]  Not their members, but the leadership and the organization.
[01:15:34.599 --> 01:15:35.320]  That's just a fact.
[01:15:36.225 --> 01:15:38.266]  We've done analysis on that and given you all the documents.
[01:15:38.286 --> 01:15:40.386]  And they're the only real national group.
[01:15:40.426 --> 01:15:44.347]  JPFO is great, but they're more of a, you know, analyzing group and a group.
[01:15:44.507 --> 01:15:44.968]  Think Tank.
[01:15:45.128 --> 01:15:47.508]  Yeah, Think Tank goes after the VA, and I say join them.
[01:15:47.888 --> 01:15:54.030]  But I want you, and they also work closely with gun owners, it's integrated, but you need to call them now.
[01:15:54.110 --> 01:15:56.411]  You need to become a yearly member.
[01:15:56.491 --> 01:16:01.172]  It's so inexpensive to, or at least sign up for the free legislative alerts on email.
[01:16:01.452 --> 01:16:03.533]  You need to become a lifetime member.
[01:16:03.633 --> 01:16:04.333]  They need
[01:16:05.013 --> 01:16:07.494]  I was talking to Larry Proudly a few months ago about how I discovered this.
[01:16:07.654 --> 01:16:09.895]  They need more capital to do more.
[01:16:09.955 --> 01:16:15.658]  And I'm telling you, every time we see something big, UN bills, you name it, because it's all integrated.
[01:16:15.678 --> 01:16:18.299]  He has to defend certain rights to then defend the Second Amendment.
[01:16:18.579 --> 01:16:19.920]  It's always popping up.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.981]  I notice key nexus points.
[01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:27.923]  And a key defense, a key brigade in our fight for freedom is Governors of America.
[01:16:27.983 --> 01:16:29.204]  They are champions.
[01:16:29.564 --> 01:16:31.085]  They keep, with a small force,
[01:16:31.825 --> 01:16:32.486]  We're good to go.
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.101]  Twenty bucks, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:49.141 --> 01:16:52.443]  They need your support like never before.
[01:16:52.864 --> 01:16:54.285]  Please support them.
[01:16:54.325 --> 01:16:55.986]  GunOwners.org.
[01:16:56.226 --> 01:16:57.567]  And give them that toll-free number, Larry.
[01:16:57.787 --> 01:16:58.387]  That's 888-886-GUNS.
[01:16:58.507 --> 01:16:59.908]  Give it again.
[01:16:59.928 --> 01:17:00.229]  888-886-GUNS.
[01:17:08.574 --> 01:17:20.542]  Or, folks, you can call on your own dime, 703-321-8585, 703-321-8585, and do it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:20.562 --> 01:17:28.307]  I mean, I give money to Ron Paul, I give money to gun owners, I get out there and do things, you know, I put my money where my mouth is, I go down and fight gun bills here in Texas.
[01:17:28.827 --> 01:17:36.652]  I mean, this is something we all, and Larry, am I right in saying we've never seen such a coordinated attack on the right to defense?
[01:17:37.641 --> 01:17:38.502]  I don't know.
[01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:57.714]  Uh, during the Republican administration, an administration that has made the first ever appointment, because the law has been changed, of the head of the BATFE.
[01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:08.324]  And this is a guy that Ted Kennedy said, after his nomination sailed through the Judiciary Committee this week, that he was looking forward to working with him on gun control.
[01:18:09.239 --> 01:18:19.003]  Isn't that nice that we have a supposedly pro-gun president nominating a guy who is a Massachusetts political type.
[01:18:20.323 --> 01:18:21.684]  Kennedy's well acquainted with him.
[01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.165]  He was in the legislature.
[01:18:24.945 --> 01:18:26.606]  The guy's been in other offices.
[01:18:26.726 --> 01:18:28.146]  Kennedy knows what he's talking about.
[01:18:28.386 --> 01:18:29.567]  I don't think our guys make.
[01:18:30.646 --> 01:18:37.288]  When we get back, I want to know where the Veteran Disarmament Act is and how we can hopefully fight that and any other major threats.
[01:18:37.328 --> 01:18:39.789]  Final segment with Larry Pratt on the other side.
[01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:40.909]  Join today.
[01:18:41.409 --> 01:18:42.349]  Join the brigade.
[01:18:42.449 --> 01:18:43.430]  GodOwners.org.
[01:18:53.351 --> 01:18:53.952]  We're good to go.
[01:19:12.808 --> 01:19:14.650]  A $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:16.912]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:19:16.973 --> 01:19:21.858]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:19:21.918 --> 01:19:24.360]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.905]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:19:29.245 --> 01:19:29.645]  The U.S.
[01:19:29.686 --> 01:19:34.070]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:19:34.150 --> 01:19:35.932]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:19:36.352 --> 01:19:39.115]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[01:19:39.395 --> 01:19:40.596]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[01:19:40.717 --> 01:19:46.322]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[01:19:46.402 --> 01:19:46.642]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:46.662 --> 01:19:46.842]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:56.985]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[01:19:57.305 --> 01:20:02.307]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[01:20:02.707 --> 01:20:07.869]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:20:08.089 --> 01:20:08.669]  Here's why.
[01:20:08.869 --> 01:20:16.852]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[01:20:16.852 --> 01:20:17.432]  I think so.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:36.640]  We're good.
[01:20:53.470 --> 01:20:56.414]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:20:56.574 --> 01:21:01.800]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:07.406]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:07.807 --> 01:21:08.888]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:09.268 --> 01:21:18.356]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:21:18.616 --> 01:21:20.197]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[01:21:20.437 --> 01:21:29.285]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:21:29.665 --> 01:21:31.767]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:21:33.508 --> 01:21:34.249]  Keep it natural.
[01:21:34.569 --> 01:21:42.776]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:21:42.997 --> 01:21:47.000]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.221]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:21:53.343 --> 01:21:53.803]  Hi, Ken.
[01:21:53.863 --> 01:21:54.623]  It's Judy again.
[01:21:54.643 --> 01:21:59.164]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:21:59.324 --> 01:22:02.465]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:22:02.685 --> 01:22:04.565]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:22:04.845 --> 01:22:06.925]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:22:07.105 --> 01:22:13.206]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:18.707]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:22:18.967 --> 01:22:21.828]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:22:21.948 --> 01:22:22.868]  Go KenSolar!
[01:22:24.176 --> 01:22:25.697]  Get the best of both worlds.
[01:22:26.117 --> 01:22:31.221]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all-in-one.

[01:22:32.822 --> 01:22:36.604]  No long gas lines, no fumes and no noise.
[01:22:37.325 --> 01:22:39.987]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.

[01:22:47.472 --> 01:22:51.875]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[01:23:13.853 --> 01:23:15.054]  Larry Pratt is our guest.
[01:23:15.094 --> 01:23:17.516]  In the five minutes we've got left, sir, you've got the floor.
[01:23:17.917 --> 01:23:21.740]  Run through the gamut, please, of what we face and where the Victim Disarmament Act is right now.
[01:23:22.538 --> 01:23:24.219]  Yeah, let's start with that.
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:31.604]  This thing is going to hit veterans hard, the fastest, the soonest, because they're already illegally in the database.
[01:23:31.664 --> 01:23:40.270]  We thought it was initially just the 83,000 that Bill Clinton had directed the Veterans Administration to put into the prohibited person list.
[01:23:40.894 --> 01:23:56.790]  When he was leaving office, but it turns out, because Dr. Coburn, Senator from Oklahoma, has continued to press, and he has found out from the Veterans Administration that they've been putting names in at about a thousand a month, but the total is now around 140,000 and counting.
[01:23:56.810 --> 01:23:58.372]  And then a gentleman came forth
[01:24:03.628 --> 01:24:11.453]  The person who had been getting a lot of calls from people and he called me to find out what was going on here in Washington.
[01:24:11.493 --> 01:24:25.563]  I explained the bill to him and he said, well, I was the, let me see if I can get all these titles right, Deputy Assistant Secretary at the Veterans Administration and in that position and in the office of the Secretary of Defense before that, he left government in 06,
[01:24:26.781 --> 01:24:42.217]  He dealt specifically over quite a long period of time with this whole issue of post-traumatic stress disorder which supposedly, well the debate he told us in the VA is not over whether these guys should be put in the database but whether
[01:24:43.237 --> 01:24:46.239]  Every veteran should have such a diagnosis.
[01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:49.680]  That's a pretty chilling implication.
[01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:51.861]  And yet there's no... No, they do, like the Soviets.
[01:24:51.922 --> 01:24:54.123]  They say, basically, you're all mentally ill.
[01:24:54.423 --> 01:24:54.963]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:24:55.003 --> 01:25:03.707]  And there's no data whatsoever to show that these guys commit crimes in any greater number, percentage, than the rest of the population.
[01:25:04.328 --> 01:25:07.049]  In fact, guys that have had PTSD diagnoses
[01:25:07.509 --> 01:25:09.830]  From pretty much straight through after Vietnam.
[01:25:10.090 --> 01:25:11.711]  They've had careers, families.
[01:25:11.751 --> 01:25:18.794]  We know they have concealed carry permits, which alone says they've been... The point is, this is massive discrimination against our veterans and police.
[01:25:18.814 --> 01:25:21.635]  And firemen, and victims of crime.
[01:25:22.395 --> 01:25:28.538]  Anybody that they can... Well, as the guy pointed out, his name is McClendon, Mike McClendon.
[01:25:29.418 --> 01:25:34.380]  Anybody could really be diagnosed PTSD because it really isn't a disorder.
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:35.800]  How do we beat that, Bill?
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:36.761]  How do we beat the lost...
[01:25:38.897 --> 01:25:40.798]  We've got to be talking to the Senators.
[01:25:40.838 --> 01:25:46.442]  We've got email on our website that people can read about it and then send an email off to their Senators.
[01:25:46.522 --> 01:25:46.943]  It's quick.
[01:25:47.063 --> 01:25:47.523]  It's free.
[01:25:48.284 --> 01:25:50.646]  And they really need to hear from people back home.
[01:25:51.006 --> 01:25:58.551]  They were hoping they would get the treaty through before any delays, but happily, the Vitter Amendment, I think, is going to buy us some time.
[01:25:58.751 --> 01:25:59.752]  Maybe we'll get the treaty.
[01:25:59.772 --> 01:26:00.793]  We have a lot of victories.
[01:26:00.833 --> 01:26:01.554]  That's my point.
[01:26:01.994 --> 01:26:05.877]  When people get involved and we're able to head them off at the pass nine times out of ten.
[01:26:06.613 --> 01:26:10.336]  Oh yeah, this thing would be a done deal right now if it weren't for Coburn who bought us the time.
[01:26:10.796 --> 01:26:14.939]  Now we've been able to bring a lot of public pressure, grassroots pressure to bear.
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:21.845]  If it weren't for just a handful of people, it shows you that the government really doesn't work by majority.
[01:26:22.325 --> 01:26:23.346]  Things happen because
[01:26:23.826 --> 01:26:29.372]  Individuals know what they're doing, and are committed to doing it, and are not afraid of the pushback.
[01:26:29.932 --> 01:26:35.878]  You just can't imagine the pressure that they've tried to use to get Tom Coburn to back down.
[01:26:36.018 --> 01:26:40.082]  And praise the Lord, this guy just doesn't back down.
[01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:47.049]  He's done his homework, he's read the bill, and he's now met with this guy Mike McClendon, the former Deputy Assistant Secretary.
[01:26:48.250 --> 01:26:51.572]  And he's going after the Veterans Administration for more information.
[01:26:52.112 --> 01:26:55.233]  Rather than being on the defensive, this guy just keeps going ahead.
[01:26:55.253 --> 01:26:56.274]  You just got to know them.
[01:26:56.534 --> 01:27:02.897]  Now for the audience, you don't need to go pay $20 a year at Gun Owners, though you should for yearly membership or $500 for a lifetime.
[01:27:03.237 --> 01:27:05.078]  Been around since the 70s.
[01:27:05.498 --> 01:27:09.200]  The only real big national gun group out there that most people don't even know about
[01:27:10.279 --> 01:27:10.459]  I don't
[01:27:28.064 --> 01:27:28.384]  I think so.
[01:27:44.813 --> 01:27:50.575]  Against losing your Second Amendment or if you're for Ron Paul, pick a couple issues and we need you to take action.
[01:27:50.956 --> 01:27:56.258]  Please, give them a call at 703-321-8585, 703-321-8585.
[01:27:57.138 --> 01:28:01.520]  Ask how you can help, or simply go to gunowners.org and join.
[01:28:01.860 --> 01:28:06.082]  I mean, don't, but, look, if you don't have a pot to you-know-what in, that's fine.
[01:28:06.202 --> 01:28:07.762]  Go use the email functions.
[01:28:08.082 --> 01:28:09.163]  Go use what they've got there.
[01:28:09.203 --> 01:28:09.443]  Larry?
[01:28:09.463 --> 01:28:14.345]  Again, if you have to go and you don't have email, you can go to the public library and do it that way.
[01:28:15.205 --> 01:28:15.705]  You can do it.
[01:28:17.666 --> 01:28:25.448]  Larry Pratt, I want to thank you for your continued defense of the Second Amendment, the absolute bedrock of our liberty and freedom in this country.
[01:28:25.468 --> 01:28:26.588]  Great working with you, Alex.
[01:28:26.608 --> 01:28:26.948]  Thank you.
[01:28:27.228 --> 01:28:27.629]  Thank you.
[01:28:27.669 --> 01:28:29.869]  Larry Pratt, the Executive Director of Governors of America.
[01:28:29.909 --> 01:28:30.569]  God bless you, sir.
[01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:32.130]  Take care.
[01:28:43.855 --> 01:28:46.863]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:50.493]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.718 --> 01:28:57.059]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:28:57.399 --> 01:29:04.301]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:29:04.681 --> 01:29:17.164]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:29:17.404 --> 01:29:20.045]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:29:20.385 --> 01:29:26.589]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:29:26.809 --> 01:29:31.953]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:29:32.213 --> 01:29:40.458]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:29:40.678 --> 01:29:41.319]  And the best part?
[01:29:41.539 --> 01:29:43.540]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:46.383]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:29:52.958 --> 01:30:00.419]  Hi, I'm Lynette Brooks, founder of MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse combining the healing power of flaxseed with the detoxification of bentonite clay.
[01:30:00.740 --> 01:30:06.761]  In a perfect world, we would eat natural, healthy foods, but the foods we eat today are not the foods nature intended for us.
[01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:08.881]  Fast food is toxic food.
[01:30:09.281 --> 01:30:12.902]  I've been producing MediCleanse for over 20 years, and customers from across the U.S.
[01:30:12.922 --> 01:30:17.923]  say that MediCleanse helps your body detoxify from fast foods as well as other environmental poisons.
[01:30:18.243 --> 01:30:21.245]  Such as heavy metals and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:30:21.585 --> 01:30:24.126]  For centuries, flax has been known as nature's superfood.
[01:30:24.607 --> 01:30:31.650]  Even the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:36.133]  A one-month supply of MediCleanse is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:30:36.253 --> 01:30:42.096]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com for only $22.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:30:42.256 --> 01:30:43.056]  Or call me today at 1-800-317-9547
[01:30:46.139 --> 01:30:46.581]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:30:46.621 --> 01:30:48.168]  Radiant Health has never been easier.
[01:30:52.984 --> 01:30:56.426]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:30:56.666 --> 01:30:58.807]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:30:58.927 --> 01:31:01.388]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:31:01.648 --> 01:31:06.011]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:31:06.051 --> 01:31:06.711]  Here's why.
[01:31:07.131 --> 01:31:13.074]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:31:13.294 --> 01:31:19.297]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:31:19.537 --> 01:31:20.458]  But they're not cheating.
[01:31:20.678 --> 01:31:24.701]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:31:24.881 --> 01:31:29.224]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:31:29.324 --> 01:31:36.829]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:31:36.869 --> 01:31:37.469]  Get control.
[01:31:37.709 --> 01:31:38.270]  Get relief.
[01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:39.010]  Get some sleep.
[01:31:39.130 --> 01:31:42.333]  Go to www.outin90.com.
[01:31:42.473 --> 01:31:45.855]  That's www.outin90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:46.115]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:50.598 --> 01:31:51.418]  Let it roll!
[01:32:26.071 --> 01:32:32.853]  Watch it Sunday on the internet at LooseChainTheFinalCut.com.
[01:32:32.913 --> 01:32:35.754]  Links up on PrisonPlanet.com, but check out the new website.
[01:32:37.103 --> 01:32:41.465]  Right now, Steve Watts is at a story for InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:42.406 --> 01:32:46.408]  Loose change, Final Cut is here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:46.428 --> 01:32:47.048]  That's the headline.
[01:32:47.068 --> 01:32:53.331]  Loose change, Final Cut is here and is, uh, you can order the DVD right now.
[01:32:53.391 --> 01:32:54.892]  It'll be shipping in just a week or two.
[01:32:54.952 --> 01:32:55.552]  We've already got it.
[01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:56.532]  I'm trying to figure out exactly.
[01:32:56.552 --> 01:32:59.794]  We said we'd ship it on the 20th, but we're saying, why not just ship it early?
[01:33:00.763 --> 01:33:01.843]  The point is, get your order in now.
[01:33:01.863 --> 01:33:03.064]  It'll be shipping very, very soon.
[01:33:03.084 --> 01:33:08.225]  I mean, it's already, what, the 9th, so I guess... Yeah, it'll be shipping in the next week.
[01:33:08.245 --> 01:33:08.805]  We can say that.
[01:33:09.686 --> 01:33:12.646]  It's supposed to ship the week of the 20th, but we'll see.
[01:33:13.247 --> 01:33:17.208]  I'm the executive producer, and we can do whatever we want, as long as the guys are good with it.
[01:33:17.228 --> 01:33:17.768]  I know they are.
[01:33:17.788 --> 01:33:28.471]  And that's why we're going to go ahead and start sales early today instead of Monday, and you'll be able to start watching it Sunday evening at LooseChange911.com or at LooseChange, The Final Cut.
[01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:37.186]  Right now, I wanted to play this Daily Show piece because it kind of is sick in a way because it makes a joke out of torture.
[01:33:37.206 --> 01:33:43.068]  I know it's a joke show, but I'm seeing a shift now as they get ready for the Democrats to come in.
[01:33:43.268 --> 01:33:43.688]  Here it is.
[01:33:44.509 --> 01:33:48.010]  Who we are, what we believe in, is our children learning.
[01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:53.311]  Would we, in fact, like fries with that?
[01:33:53.651 --> 01:33:55.852]  Do we torture?
[01:33:58.118 --> 01:34:02.420]  Which, like any weighty question of ethics, is actually a question of semantics.
[01:34:03.140 --> 01:34:04.000]  Well, I have torture.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:06.001]  What's your definition?
[01:34:06.041 --> 01:34:07.022]  That's defined in U.S.
[01:34:07.082 --> 01:34:07.342]  law.
[01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:14.445]  It is?
[01:34:15.145 --> 01:34:16.165]  Here you go.
[01:34:16.225 --> 01:34:16.605]  Torture.
[01:34:16.665 --> 01:34:25.269]  An act specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering.
[01:34:26.950 --> 01:34:27.730]  And we don't torture.
[01:34:31.059 --> 01:34:32.340]  Hmm.
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:35.060]  Hmm.
[01:34:35.281 --> 01:34:36.161]  Hmm.
[01:34:36.821 --> 01:34:39.302]  Suck on that, Belgium!
[01:34:39.702 --> 01:34:40.502]  We don't torture.
[01:34:40.542 --> 01:34:43.763]  I'm so glad we don't inflict severe physical or mental... What's this right here?
[01:34:44.164 --> 01:34:44.284]  Oh!
[01:34:44.764 --> 01:34:45.284]  Hey, look at this.
[01:34:45.324 --> 01:34:47.385]  It's a Justice Department memo in my U.S.
[01:34:47.425 --> 01:34:47.645]  law.
[01:34:48.085 --> 01:34:52.606]  Uh, we are allowed to head slap, expose people to extreme damages, and simulate drowning.
[01:34:53.067 --> 01:34:59.709]  Uh, which is called waterboarding, which, by the way, sounds so much better than simulate drowning.
[01:35:01.738 --> 01:35:03.879]  You know, when you get waterboarded, it sounds like fun!
[01:35:03.899 --> 01:35:07.381]  I can't wait to hop in my Jeep Liberty, drink some Mountain Dew, and go waterboarding!
[01:35:10.263 --> 01:35:12.625]  But see, this is the trouble with not being barbaric.
[01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:15.146]  We always find ourselves in these gray areas.
[01:35:15.186 --> 01:35:19.349]  You'd be amazed how much uncertainty there is in the realm of drowning.
[01:35:19.729 --> 01:35:24.212]  Even when you're last to a board with water being poured on your face, there's still quite a bit of wiggle room.
[01:35:24.852 --> 01:35:25.833]  It depends on how it's done.
[01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:28.074]  It depends on the circumstances.
[01:35:28.094 --> 01:35:29.635]  It depends on who does it.
[01:35:30.415 --> 01:35:31.416]  Uh, you know, like, uh...
[01:35:34.997 --> 01:35:39.361]  Let's say, I don't know, let's say the person doing it is, I don't know, the Harlem Globetrotters.
[01:35:39.401 --> 01:35:40.081]  Let's say it's them.
[01:35:41.262 --> 01:35:46.406]  So you think it's going to be water in the bucket, but at the last second, turns out the bucket is filled with confetti!
[01:35:47.667 --> 01:35:48.247]  Very funny!
[01:35:48.508 --> 01:35:49.008]  Torture?
[01:35:49.829 --> 01:35:50.489]  I would say no.
[01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:54.172]  I think the way it's been defined in the media, it shouldn't be done.
[01:35:54.612 --> 01:35:57.594]  The way in which they've described it, particularly in the liberal media.
[01:35:58.475 --> 01:35:59.336]  Ah, interesting point.
[01:35:59.536 --> 01:36:01.057]  What is the liberal definition of
[01:36:01.764 --> 01:36:04.926]  What is the liberal definition of... I have the liberal dictionary right here.
[01:36:04.966 --> 01:36:09.408]  Let's see what... Let's see how they describe... define waterboarding.
[01:36:09.688 --> 01:36:16.771]  Something done by the evil troops who we don't support to innocent terrorists, violating their rights to bomb our cities and make us get gay married.
[01:36:18.872 --> 01:36:23.974]  I can see why you'd have a problem with that.
[01:36:24.034 --> 01:36:25.235]  What about... Anyway...
[01:36:27.958 --> 01:36:28.878]  You want to know something interesting?
[01:36:28.898 --> 01:36:31.619]  It turns out the Liberal Dictionary is also a children's Bible.
[01:36:31.759 --> 01:36:34.520]  I don't know.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:39.801]  It's as though somebody just slapped some sort of cover on it that said Liberal Dictionary.
[01:36:40.482 --> 01:36:43.983]  What about the nominee for Attorney General?
[01:36:44.043 --> 01:36:45.703]  Our nation's top law enforcement official.
[01:36:45.923 --> 01:36:50.605]  He can provide the concrete legal and ethical precision we need to figure out whether or not we should be drowning people.
[01:36:51.345 --> 01:36:55.406]  Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse, who by the way has the best rebus of any sitting senator,
[01:36:57.549 --> 01:36:58.730]  Pose the question.
[01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:01.191]  So is waterboarding constitutional?
[01:37:01.591 --> 01:37:03.412]  I don't know what's involved in the technique.
[01:37:03.692 --> 01:37:08.914]  If waterboarding is torture, torture is not constitutional.
[01:37:09.374 --> 01:37:14.977]  You don't know what's involved in water... How do you not know waterboarding is going to be on the test?
[01:37:16.938 --> 01:37:19.019]  Waterboarding inflicts mental pain and suffering.
[01:37:19.079 --> 01:37:21.080]  It's the definition of torture in U.S.
[01:37:21.140 --> 01:37:21.460]  law.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:26.362]  The 5th and the 14th Amendments bar conduct that shocks the conscience.
[01:37:28.681 --> 01:37:29.522]  Shock the conscience.
[01:37:29.582 --> 01:37:33.805]  By the way, that's exactly what the CIA did when they classified Jiminy Cricket as an enemy combatant.
[01:37:35.927 --> 01:37:38.789]  That somewhat raises the bar that's attached to the anal pair.
[01:37:39.209 --> 01:37:43.392]  So now conduct, it can't just be hurtful, it has to shock the conscience.
[01:37:43.853 --> 01:37:46.995]  And then the real question becomes, whose conscience are we working with here?
[01:37:47.936 --> 01:37:50.798]  Yours and mine, or maybe CIA Chief Michael Hayden's?
[01:37:51.385 --> 01:37:53.527]  Talking about the shock to conscience standard, alright?
[01:37:53.628 --> 01:38:07.943]  If they took you and me, alright, people of our age, and put us, you and me, through what Marine Corps recruits go through at Paris Island, and forced us to do that, that would probably shock the conscience.
[01:38:08.564 --> 01:38:10.326]  Oh my God, the Army's unconstitutional!
[01:38:13.587 --> 01:38:18.010]  Well, they do in a way torture the soldiers, shave their heads, sleep deprivation, break them down.
[01:38:18.050 --> 01:38:18.931]  That's more modern.
[01:38:18.951 --> 01:38:24.134]  The Germans developed that and actually in their textbooks said that it was a form of mind control.
[01:38:25.255 --> 01:38:28.077]  The French then developed similar systems right along the same lines.
[01:38:28.117 --> 01:38:30.218]  This is just the fact of the history.
[01:38:30.718 --> 01:38:31.719]  This is what's going on.
[01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:34.881]  But you notice he makes a joke about it.
[01:38:34.901 --> 01:38:36.462]  Let's see the liberal dictionary.
[01:38:36.562 --> 01:38:38.103]  Oh, they want the terrorists to attack us.
[01:38:38.123 --> 01:38:39.024]  He's almost implying
[01:38:42.289 --> 01:38:44.731]  And saying that people who are against torture hate the troops.
[01:38:45.131 --> 01:38:57.678]  Oh, the liberals that hate the troops and want to torture... Or the liberals that hate the troops and want to do all these bad things and want the terrorists to attack us.
[01:38:57.698 --> 01:38:59.799]  See, that's saying, oh, see, torture's good.
[01:38:59.819 --> 01:39:05.682]  I don't know, just the whole flavor of that completely and totally changed.
[01:39:07.552 --> 01:39:16.016]  The entire angle from which he's been coming and basically speaking in the last few years, Mr. Stewart, kind of shifting there.
[01:39:16.656 --> 01:39:25.420]  All right, Jason Bermas is online with us for the rest of the hour, and then actor, TV star, documentary filmmaker, Turk Pipkin will be joining us.
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:33.363]  He's traveled all over the world, and I guess you could use that label, progressive, but I mean, he's a really good guy.
[01:39:34.193 --> 01:39:37.834]  And he's gone into Africa and put water systems in, you name it.
[01:39:37.854 --> 01:39:40.435]  His film's extremely powerful and very well done.
[01:39:40.455 --> 01:39:47.136]  Went into a lot of dangerous areas, so I just want to get his take, kind of through his eyes, what he's seen out there.
[01:39:47.216 --> 01:39:48.077]  And also Willie Nelson.
[01:39:48.097 --> 01:39:49.257]  He's real good friends with Willie Nelson.
[01:39:49.417 --> 01:39:53.078]  They wrote a book together that just came out.
[01:39:54.638 --> 01:40:01.180]  I'd met Turk before, been in a movie with Turk, but then I ran into him and Willie Nelson a few weeks ago, and then I ran into him again this weekend.
[01:40:02.176 --> 01:40:02.797]  Well, thanks for having me.
[01:40:17.316 --> 01:40:18.918]  This will be a day long remembered.
[01:40:19.418 --> 01:40:33.190]  Sunday night, going into Monday morning, we're going to post on the two different websites, LooseChangeTheFinalCut.com and LooseChange911.com the Loose Change Final Cut, and it's a totally new film.
[01:40:34.271 --> 01:40:45.418]  People can order the DVD right now, and we were putting that date out there to make sure we had time to get the DVDs in, but now the DVDs are in, and we might as well just confer right here on air.
[01:40:45.798 --> 01:40:47.539]  Jason, talk to the guys today and see.
[01:40:47.979 --> 01:40:54.724]  We could go ahead and say this stuff ships next Friday or something, I guess, and so people just aren't pre-ordering.
[01:40:54.764 --> 01:40:55.844]  I mean, they're here.
[01:40:55.905 --> 01:40:56.865]  People can order now.
[01:40:57.446 --> 01:40:57.946]  What do you think?
[01:40:58.718 --> 01:40:59.519]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:59.699 --> 01:41:03.142]  Get your pre-orders in now and maybe you'll have it by Thanksgiving.
[01:41:03.502 --> 01:41:08.486]  There's nothing more that you should be doing than spreading this information to your family, especially around the holidays.
[01:41:10.187 --> 01:41:11.548]  Well, I agree with you, my friend.
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:14.081]  Get into the film.
[01:41:14.421 --> 01:41:17.503]  This is a totally new film, a whole new level of quality.
[01:41:18.083 --> 01:41:20.945]  You guys busted your hide-ins the last two and a half years making this.
[01:41:20.965 --> 01:41:21.505]  Tell us about it.
[01:41:22.145 --> 01:41:22.866]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:41:22.926 --> 01:41:24.587]  This is an entirely new film.
[01:41:25.187 --> 01:41:28.289]  And, you know, we start out with the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:41:28.329 --> 01:41:37.395]  We start out at ground zero in 2006 to show that there are thousands of us that have a big concern in what the government and media have told us about 9-11.
[01:41:38.379 --> 01:41:39.960]  From there, we have a little introduction.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:52.344]  We go over, you know, Robert Wright and Larry Klayman in front of Judicial Watch, discussing how, you know, they tried to come forward with the actual terrorist funding, and, you know, that they knew who some of the hijackers were, and they were forwarded by members of the FBI.
[01:41:52.805 --> 01:41:55.266]  From there, we get into the hijackers themselves.
[01:41:55.306 --> 01:41:58.547]  We go over the information that many of them trained at U.S.
[01:41:58.687 --> 01:42:04.029]  air bases, including Pensacola Navy Station, Monterey, California, and Maxwell Air Force Base.
[01:42:04.662 --> 01:42:14.335]  You know, after that we get into the war games and we were actually able to obtain that 144 hours of NORAD tape about four or five months ago.
[01:42:14.736 --> 01:42:15.757]  Some of that makes it in there.
[01:42:15.797 --> 01:42:17.099]  Boy, did that trigger harassment!
[01:42:19.862 --> 01:42:20.642]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:42:20.702 --> 01:42:27.845]  And you know, the funny thing is that, you know, a lot of the debunkers say, well, you know, those war games, they were scheduled that day, but as soon as the attacks happened, they were called off.
[01:42:28.285 --> 01:42:29.406]  Tapes tell a different story.
[01:42:29.726 --> 01:42:37.849]  Tapes tell the story of generals and colonels on the phone after three planes have struck their targets asking Cheyenne Mountain to stop putting inputs on their screen.
[01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:39.630]  You know, the tapes tell the story of
[01:42:40.171 --> 01:42:44.614]  These air traffic controllers chasing Flight 11 for 40 minutes after it hit the tower.
[01:42:44.915 --> 01:42:46.616]  You know, the tapes tell the real story.
[01:42:46.856 --> 01:42:52.240]  The exercises were coinciding with planes going in and out of radar that were hijacked and hitting buildings.
[01:42:54.262 --> 01:42:55.462]  And it just goes on and on.
[01:42:55.522 --> 01:42:57.284]  This is an entirely new film.
[01:42:57.364 --> 01:42:59.806]  It's not just clips and analysis and bombs going off.
[01:42:59.846 --> 01:43:00.266]  It's all that.
[01:43:00.306 --> 01:43:01.447]  It's all these incredible interviews.
[01:43:01.767 --> 01:43:02.988]  Tell people about some of the interviews.
[01:43:03.008 --> 01:43:06.851]  You can order it right now at PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:43:06.891 --> 01:43:08.332]  Big links to go watch the trailer.
[01:43:08.492 --> 01:43:09.253]  Order it right now.
[01:43:09.293 --> 01:43:09.573]  Go ahead.
[01:43:10.265 --> 01:43:30.895]  Sure, you know, some of the great interviews that we got that actually made the film are former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, she's in this movie, a 26-year CIA veteran, Ray McGovern is in this film, of course Stephen Jones, Kevin Ryan also making an appearance, Gordon Ross is also in the movie, and there were just so many interviews that not every interview made it.
[01:43:30.935 --> 01:43:39.960]  I mean, we were able to actually interview the mayor of Indian Lake, and he tells us when he got there, he wouldn't have known a plane had crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania unless someone told him.
[01:43:40.876 --> 01:43:46.611]  Which shows how popular mechanics and BB6B caught up and spun what he really even said in their TV shows.
[01:43:47.093 --> 01:43:47.514]  That's right.
[01:43:47.554 --> 01:43:48.937]  He was the gentleman in the boat.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:44:00.744]  In the BBC piece talking about all the small pieces of debris in Indian Lake, what they fail to mention is that there was a debris field, a secondary debris field, over a mountain ridge eight miles away in New Baltimore.
[01:44:00.764 --> 01:44:11.547]  Yeah, they built a straw man and said that we claimed the lake was the furthest point, we never said it, and then they make up that we claimed the map thing showed four miles, it was only one, we never did that!
[01:44:11.808 --> 01:44:13.088]  They just make stuff up!
[01:44:14.008 --> 01:44:22.790]  Absolutely, and when we actually showed him the 9-11 commissioner report where they said that they were not tracking Flight 93 until 10-06, he just couldn't believe it.
[01:44:23.011 --> 01:44:35.074]  He looks at it in the movie, he's in astonishment, he discusses how he heard what he thought at first was a missile going over his house and that he suspects that they were the fighter jets that were actually tailing Flight 93.
[01:44:36.164 --> 01:44:38.845]  Now, here's the analogy for those that don't get what a straw man is.
[01:44:38.885 --> 01:44:46.388]  I know most of you do, but for those that don't, that's where you don't actually fight Jason Mermis or Alex Jones or any of these other people.
[01:44:47.209 --> 01:44:55.452]  That is where you build a straw man, dress him up, paint him up like the person, and then go beat it up and claim that you defeated the individual when you didn't.
[01:44:56.241 --> 01:45:02.104]  Okay, it'd be like drawing a picture of Alex Jones and then tearing it up and saying you beat Alex Jones up.
[01:45:03.325 --> 01:45:04.105]  Here's another analogy.
[01:45:04.445 --> 01:45:13.630]  It'd be like if I said, Jason, how dare you say that Godzilla orbits Pluto and has dinner every day with Ronald McDonald and the Hamburglar.
[01:45:15.031 --> 01:45:21.135]  But Jason doesn't say that Godzilla orbits Pluto and has dinner every evening with the Hamburglar and Grimace and Ronald McDonald.
[01:45:22.236 --> 01:45:23.077]  That's what they do.
[01:45:23.157 --> 01:45:26.179]  We don't say this, and then they say that we say this.
[01:45:26.439 --> 01:45:29.962]  They say, the family members all hate you, and the majority don't.
[01:45:30.002 --> 01:45:30.703]  They've gone public.
[01:45:30.723 --> 01:45:31.903]  They've spoken out years ago.
[01:45:32.144 --> 01:45:32.824]  They're in the film.
[01:45:33.685 --> 01:45:34.666]  That's a strong man.
[01:45:35.046 --> 01:45:38.969]  They say that we claim the firefighters blew the buildings up.
[01:45:39.009 --> 01:45:41.711]  They walk up to me on the street in New York, you know, these hired hacks, and go,
[01:45:41.971 --> 01:45:45.432]  Well, I'm so glad that you brought up the family members because they do play a prominent role in this picture.
[01:45:45.452 --> 01:45:48.433]  A lot of people don't realize that they were very unhappy during the 9-11 Commission hearings.
[01:46:06.605 --> 01:46:14.632]  And in both the NORAD section and the 9-11 Commission section, you can see how unhappy they are as they stand up and protest what's going on in these hearings.
[01:46:14.692 --> 01:46:17.155]  People like Christopher Brodeur.
[01:46:17.655 --> 01:46:24.581]  I forget who the woman is who holds the fiction sign while Giuliani is speaking, but these people were legitimately upset.
[01:46:25.322 --> 01:46:29.686]  It got play in the media for maybe half a day, and then it just, you know, went on as news as usual.
[01:46:30.433 --> 01:46:37.617]  Well, we've had Bill Doyle on a year and a half ago, the head of the biggest group, highly respected all over every TV show, and saying, yeah, they killed my son Joey.
[01:46:37.637 --> 01:46:38.718]  It's a total inside job.
[01:46:38.758 --> 01:46:41.939]  The majority of the victims groups believe it's an inside job.
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:43.720]  And that was a year and a half ago.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:46.342]  But oh no, no family member thinks it.
[01:46:47.182 --> 01:46:48.703]  Well, that's just absolutely ludicrous.
[01:46:48.763 --> 01:46:51.865]  You have people like Bob McElveen on the CBC and other shows.
[01:46:52.378 --> 01:46:55.519]  Discussing about how he also believes it's an inside job.
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:58.181]  You know, we know a lot of family members, personally.
[01:46:58.221 --> 01:47:00.442]  We know a lot of the first responders, personally.
[01:47:00.482 --> 01:47:02.503]  We know a lot of the firefighters, personally.
[01:47:02.883 --> 01:47:09.486]  And, you know, John Schroeder is in this movie, and you can actually see him in the Naughty Brothers film as one of the first firefighters on the scene.
[01:47:09.886 --> 01:47:20.531]  And he discusses in the picture how when he got there, got there about 5-10 minutes after the plane had actually hit, they were in the lobby, grouping up, figuring out their plan of attack, when then,
[01:47:21.104 --> 01:47:22.525]  The elevators exploded.
[01:47:22.585 --> 01:47:28.030]  So, this explosion that happened to some of these elevators happened a good 10-15 minutes after the plane had actually hit.
[01:47:28.050 --> 01:47:34.996]  So the claim that the jet fuel went down a thousand plus feet, 70 plus floors, and blew out in the lobby is absolutely ludicrous.
[01:47:36.787 --> 01:47:42.912]  Jason Mermis, I hope people will go to PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:47:42.932 --> 01:47:47.136]  We've got big links to the new website, LooseChangeTheFinalCut.com.
[01:47:47.476 --> 01:47:49.237]  You can buy the DVD there right now.
[01:47:49.277 --> 01:47:55.562]  You can go to LooseChange911.com, the Loose Change crew site.
[01:47:55.602 --> 01:47:56.363]  It's the same price, $19.95.
[01:47:56.503 --> 01:47:59.706]  It's a two-hour film with extras.
[01:48:00.561 --> 01:48:01.682]  It is a DVD-9.
[01:48:01.742 --> 01:48:03.823]  It is unbelievably powerful.
[01:48:03.923 --> 01:48:09.707]  It is the penultimate final loose change.
[01:48:10.588 --> 01:48:12.689]  And it is a totally new film.
[01:48:12.909 --> 01:48:16.011]  And you see the growth and the research of these young men.
[01:48:16.032 --> 01:48:25.158]  And again, it feels so good watching you guys develop this, being able to come in and help when you guys ask for some guidance and help and support financially.
[01:48:25.578 --> 01:48:28.440]  And to now see it actually coming out to be released
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:38.731]  This Sunday evening you'll be able to watch it at the different websites LooseChains, TheFinalCut.com, PrismPlanet.com and the other sites.
[01:48:40.033 --> 01:48:43.257]  You'll be able to download it, watch it in super high quality.
[01:48:43.277 --> 01:48:46.060]  It's sitting close to DVD quality in these new players and systems.
[01:48:46.660 --> 01:48:47.340]  We're good to go.
[01:49:12.899 --> 01:49:14.740]  Uh, that he's a total 9-11 truther.
[01:49:14.780 --> 01:49:15.841]  His dad just went public.
[01:49:16.402 --> 01:49:24.467]  Uh, but this is Dylan doing it, and, uh, you know, so it's a classic loose change, and it's the best voiceover that Dylan has done.
[01:49:25.413 --> 01:49:26.153]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:26.173 --> 01:49:32.436]  We went down to New York City to professionally record this at SMT Studios, and we thank them for their time and effort.
[01:49:32.837 --> 01:49:36.738]  I'm just so excited to get this movie out to as many people as possible.
[01:49:36.798 --> 01:49:42.381]  I'm actually going to be screening it with Minnesota We Are Change on Sunday at 4.30 at the Riverview Theater.
[01:49:42.681 --> 01:49:43.802]  Very excited to do that.
[01:49:44.082 --> 01:49:47.363]  We really want as many people as possible to see this movie.
[01:49:47.383 --> 01:49:47.724]  Stay there.
[01:49:47.744 --> 01:49:52.166]  We're going to come back, talk about that premiere in New York, talk about the new film.
[01:49:52.206 --> 01:49:52.946]  Let's change the final cut.
[01:49:53.832 --> 01:49:55.234]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.254 --> 01:49:57.357]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.077 --> 01:50:02.363]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:02.964 --> 01:50:04.746]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:50:05.026 --> 01:50:08.070]  Is that their objective, being world domination?
[01:50:08.571 --> 01:50:10.994]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:11.747 --> 01:50:19.091]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.112 --> 01:50:27.055]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.555 --> 01:50:31.058]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.418 --> 01:50:33.919]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for New World Order.
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:35.140]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:35.861]  They're not after money.
[01:50:35.881 --> 01:50:37.002]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.202 --> 01:50:37.982]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.002 --> 01:50:39.063]  That's their after mission.
[01:50:39.343 --> 01:50:43.886]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:50:44.106 --> 01:50:47.128]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:47.228 --> 01:50:50.711]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:50.871 --> 01:50:52.012]  You have been warned.
[01:50:52.657 --> 01:50:57.761]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:57.821 --> 01:51:05.126]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.266 --> 01:51:15.914]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.114 --> 01:51:20.657]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:20.677 --> 01:51:21.237]  I don't know.
[01:51:39.182 --> 01:51:44.051]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:52.694 --> 01:51:56.035]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:51:56.375 --> 01:52:03.278]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:52:03.638 --> 01:52:16.143]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000-year-old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:52:16.363 --> 01:52:19.004]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:52:19.364 --> 01:52:25.548]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:52:25.788 --> 01:52:30.932]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:52:31.172 --> 01:52:39.437]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:52:39.637 --> 01:52:40.298]  And the best part?
[01:52:40.518 --> 01:52:42.519]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:52:42.779 --> 01:52:45.961]  Simply go to 321relief.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:52:52.725 --> 01:52:55.846]  I'm delighted to present my latest book, In Defense of Israel.
[01:52:56.326 --> 01:53:00.608]  This book will expose the sins of the fathers and the vicious abuse of the Jewish people.
[01:53:01.208 --> 01:53:04.009]  In Defense of Israel will shape Christian theology.
[01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:09.491]  It scripturally proves that the Jewish people as a whole did not reject Jesus as Messiah.
[01:53:10.072 --> 01:53:13.593]  It will also prove that Jesus did not come to earth to be the Messiah.
[01:53:14.333 --> 01:53:23.099]  It will prove that there was a Calvary conspiracy between Rome, the high priest, and Herod to execute Jesus as an insurrectionist too dangerous to live.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:31.225]  Since Jesus refused by word and deed to claim to be the Messiah, how can the Jews be blamed for rejecting what was never offered?
[01:53:31.745 --> 01:53:35.107]  Read it in the shocking expose, In Defense of Israel.
[01:53:35.647 --> 01:53:41.330]  This latest book by Pastor John Hagee is destined to generate lively discussions among Christians the world over.
[01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:42.970]  It's available in most U.S.
[01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.511]  bookstores.
[01:53:43.811 --> 01:53:46.092]  Or call the number on the screen and order your copy today.
[01:53:46.112 --> 01:53:48.073]  Call now or visit our website.
[01:53:48.453 --> 01:53:49.153]  Ask for offer B139.
[01:53:51.576 --> 01:53:53.478]  Yeah, that's that nut, Pastor Hagee.
[01:53:53.518 --> 01:54:01.365]  That's on his own website, saying Jesus isn't the Messiah, and this is the nut who wants to attack Iran and says Armageddon's here and it's of the Lord.
[01:54:01.385 --> 01:54:12.515]  And I'm getting emails, 90 out of 100 are positive, but 10 or so out of every 100, and we've gotten hundreds of emails, are that we made this video clip up.
[01:54:13.035 --> 01:54:15.778]  You can go watch the video on prisonplanet.com, and that we're lying.
[01:54:16.474 --> 01:54:32.359]  Just like when Dick Cheney said in front of the CFR on C-SPAN that he kept it secret that he was a CFR Director, Council on Foreign Relations, and then people said that was a fake video clip when on their own website, CFR.org, he admits that he was the director of it in the mid-90s.
[01:54:32.419 --> 01:54:35.380]  I mean, look, just stop living in denial.
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:38.280]  That's all I'm asking people to do is stop denying.
[01:54:38.720 --> 01:54:39.801]  Just look into what we're saying.
[01:54:39.841 --> 01:54:41.261]  Before you deny it, look into it.
[01:54:41.981 --> 01:54:42.202]  Okay?
[01:54:42.222 --> 01:54:43.762]  I'm sorry this guy's a complete nut.
[01:54:45.145 --> 01:54:47.866]  I mean, even if you're not a Christian, he's crazy.
[01:54:48.167 --> 01:54:49.567]  He's completely insane.
[01:54:49.847 --> 01:54:50.948]  Going back to Jason Bermas.
[01:54:50.988 --> 01:54:52.388]  Jason, two years in the making.
[01:54:52.749 --> 01:54:55.710]  Loose Change Final Cut comes out on DVD today.
[01:54:56.030 --> 01:55:04.854]  People can order at edinfowars.com or loosechangefinalcut.com or loosechange911.com and it hits the web Sunday evening.
[01:55:05.274 --> 01:55:11.596]  Now, we've got flash players in a different format, super high quality, and you guys are also going to put it out on another platform.
[01:55:11.836 --> 01:55:17.338]  Tell us about the quality that they'll be able to download it at, at the loosechange911.com website.
[01:55:17.958 --> 01:55:20.198]  Again, this is going to be top-notch streaming quality.
[01:55:20.218 --> 01:55:22.839]  You should expect nothing less from the Loose Change crew.
[01:55:23.439 --> 01:55:28.461]  And we're, again, really excited to have it stream out there and let people see it before it ships.
[01:55:28.481 --> 01:55:32.402]  You know, you've pioneered that with your prisonplanet.tv and, you know,
[01:55:33.345 --> 01:55:36.947]  This movie was big on the web, so there's no reason that it shouldn't be released on the web.
[01:55:36.967 --> 01:55:50.233]  You know, again, it's just such a powerful tool to send somebody a link to this movie, or the information, or if they have no idea about Loose Change, you can send them a link to Loose Change, a second edition for free, where they can watch that entire picture for nothing on Google Video.
[01:55:50.673 --> 01:55:55.116]  So yeah, man, we're really, really excited, and like I said, we're going to be touring with this thing.
[01:55:55.136 --> 01:56:01.959]  I'm going to be with Minnesota We Are Change on Sunday, and I believe Dylan will be in New York City with Luke Radowski, and the New York chapter of We Are Change.
[01:56:04.309 --> 01:56:04.849]  Continue.
[01:56:05.089 --> 01:56:07.030]  I mean, we've only got a few minutes left, Jason.
[01:56:07.270 --> 01:56:09.491]  Tell people about some of the other things that are covered in the film.
[01:56:10.212 --> 01:56:14.594]  Yeah, again, you know, we go over Building 7 in more depth than anybody else has.
[01:56:14.634 --> 01:56:21.537]  You know, we play the two video clips of the two people that were actually blown up in Building 7 prior to either building collapsing.
[01:56:21.797 --> 01:56:27.519]  We have video footage of the south face of World Trade Center Building 7 after at least one of the towers has collapsed.
[01:56:27.920 --> 01:56:30.861]  And lo and behold, there's just a few glass windows blown out.
[01:56:31.121 --> 01:56:33.142]  In fact, the cameraman takes refuge in there
[01:56:33.482 --> 01:56:37.085]  Walks in through the South Face Lobby, up into the Main Lobby.
[01:56:37.405 --> 01:56:44.251]  So, you know, the debunker argument that 25% of the building was scooped out after the towers fell on top of it, is absolutely ludicrous.
[01:56:44.851 --> 01:56:48.714]  We go over to Danny Joenko, who is a 30-year demolition expert.
[01:56:48.774 --> 01:56:56.100]  When seeing Building 7 for the first time, he says it's absolutely a controlled demolition, that the columns were blown from the bottom and it folded in on itself.
[01:56:56.693 --> 01:56:58.915]  So, again, you know, the proof is in the pudding.
[01:56:59.215 --> 01:57:04.380]  We've put together a two-hour plus picture of just, and I mean, we had to cut so much.
[01:57:04.420 --> 01:57:08.103]  I mean, this movie could have easily been three hours, much like a lot of your movies.
[01:57:08.123 --> 01:57:09.144]  You just don't know what to cut.
[01:57:09.164 --> 01:57:10.485]  We had to cut an entire chapter.
[01:57:10.846 --> 01:57:11.967]  It's an extra on the DVD.
[01:57:12.007 --> 01:57:13.108]  It's the flights chapter.
[01:57:13.588 --> 01:57:18.412]  And again, you know, we're just trying to use this to create awareness and, you know, get out there with other people.
[01:57:18.432 --> 01:57:22.776]  We're actually going to be doing a screening with John Steele and student scholars for 9-11 Truth in
[01:57:24.446 --> 01:57:28.069]  On the 27th in New Hampshire, and all proceeds will go to the Steelcoats Foundation.
[01:57:28.109 --> 01:57:30.551]  I mean, this guy... Tell you what, Jason, stay there for a minute.
[01:57:30.571 --> 01:57:31.552]  Let me just come back to you.
[01:57:34.854 --> 01:57:35.735]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:35.755 --> 01:57:36.836]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:38.357 --> 01:57:38.517]  What?
[01:57:38.537 --> 01:57:39.078]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.877 --> 01:57:51.979]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:53.741]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.402 --> 01:57:55.263]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.984 --> 01:57:56.926]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.546 --> 01:58:01.332]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.732 --> 01:58:05.798]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.066 --> 01:58:10.270]  We are now into our number three today.
[01:58:10.290 --> 01:58:12.473]  The broadcast has just blasted past us.
[01:58:13.414 --> 01:58:18.981]  Jason Burmiss, one of the co-producers with Dylan Avery and Cory Rowe, the most downloaded film.
[01:58:19.442 --> 01:58:20.543]  Even Bounty Ferret missed that.
[01:58:20.884 --> 01:58:24.228]  Over 100 million free downloads on Google and YouTube alone.
[01:58:25.172 --> 01:58:28.214]  One hundred plus million in English, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:28.474 --> 01:58:31.236]  Tens of millions in German and Chinese and Spanish.
[01:58:31.776 --> 01:58:34.198]  And that's just on the two major free platforms.
[01:58:34.678 --> 01:58:42.062]  They've now put out the final cut, a totally new film, incredible interviews with top CIA analysts saying inside job, you name it.
[01:58:42.383 --> 01:58:46.745]  Probably Robert Behrs, one of the most serious about him, has now gone public saying he believes it's an inside job.
[01:58:47.185 --> 01:58:49.387]  Big Dallas Cowboy, of course, we had on a few days ago.
[01:58:50.287 --> 01:58:51.748]  I don't believe the official story.
[01:58:51.768 --> 01:58:52.788]  I think something's going on there.
[01:58:52.808 --> 01:58:53.969]  That's all in the last week!
[01:59:13.238 --> 01:59:14.039]  This is incredible!
[01:59:14.639 --> 01:59:16.741]  We've got Turk Pimkin, who I don't know how to describe.
[01:59:16.761 --> 01:59:18.522]  He's a writer and incredible photographer.
[01:59:18.542 --> 01:59:19.503]  I don't even know that about him.
[01:59:20.684 --> 01:59:23.646]  And a whole bunch of movies, Sopranos, TV shows.
[01:59:23.706 --> 01:59:26.368]  It's really ridiculous how much stuff he's been in.
[01:59:26.929 --> 01:59:30.311]  And I'm just glad that I ran into him twice the last two weeks.
[01:59:30.371 --> 01:59:32.933]  I said, you know, there's a reason I'm running into this guy.
[01:59:33.394 --> 01:59:35.836]  And so we've got him in studio coming up in the next segment.
[01:59:36.296 --> 01:59:38.758]  In closing, Jason Burnless, people can order the DVD.
[01:59:38.778 --> 01:59:39.919]  It's going to ship out in about a week.
[01:59:40.599 --> 01:59:41.460]  We've got them right now.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:46.302]  Put your orders in, ladies and gentlemen, and Sunday it goes on the web, on the websites.
[01:59:46.882 --> 01:59:49.103]  And you've got a premiere coming up in New York.
[01:59:49.123 --> 01:59:49.983]  Tell folks about that.
[01:59:50.183 --> 01:59:54.465]  You're also going to be in New Hampshire, Minnesota, Dallas, a lot of other places for premieres.
[01:59:55.045 --> 01:59:55.866]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:59:56.146 --> 01:59:59.747]  Like I said, Dylan will be in New York City this weekend with Luke Rudowsky and We Are Change.
[02:00:00.148 --> 02:00:01.188]  And they're going to be screening it there.
[02:00:01.208 --> 02:00:04.309]  You can go to loosechange911.com for all the details.
[02:00:04.449 --> 02:00:08.111]  I'm going to be with Minnesota We Are Change this Sunday at the Riverview Theater.
[02:00:08.579 --> 02:00:20.527]  And like I said, we're going to be doing something with John Thiel on the 27th, and I think that's important because in this movie we also cover the fact that the EPA lied about the air quality as a desire to reopen up Wall Street.
[02:00:20.567 --> 02:00:25.550]  I mean, this is exactly what the National Security... And we have the documents where Bush ordered that he should be arrested for that alone!
[02:00:26.151 --> 02:00:26.611]  Absolutely.
[02:00:26.651 --> 02:00:32.175]  Him and Christine Todd Whitman should be going to prison for manslaughter, and really murder, because people are dying from this.
[02:00:32.615 --> 02:00:35.457]  And you know, you look at the mainstream media and how they're reporting how
[02:00:36.151 --> 02:00:38.853]  You know, it wasn't the air quality, and that's just false.
[02:00:38.913 --> 02:00:41.854]  And now they're going along with the official line, when it's absolutely ludicrous.
[02:00:41.874 --> 02:00:43.375]  This is part of the white economy.
[02:00:43.395 --> 02:00:55.341]  By the way, day one, six years ago, I was just covering local New York news when they were all getting sick, and they knew it was asbestos and mercury and all those computers and mercury switches and thermostats, and they called us conspiracy theorists for four years.
[02:00:55.401 --> 02:00:56.262]  Now they admit it all.
[02:00:56.282 --> 02:00:56.862]  The last two.
[02:00:57.717 --> 02:01:02.242]  Yeah, it's very upsetting that more is not being done to help the first responders.
[02:01:02.282 --> 02:01:05.866]  I mean, for me, the Feel Good Foundation is the premier foundation.
[02:01:05.886 --> 02:01:10.611]  This man literally gave up a kidney a couple months ago so another first responder could live.
[02:01:11.291 --> 02:01:12.933]  And, you know, that's the attitude we've got to take.
[02:01:12.973 --> 02:01:14.334]  These guys were truly heroes.
[02:01:14.655 --> 02:01:17.718]  They went into those buildings to save lives, and they did not get what they deserved.
[02:01:18.533 --> 02:01:20.775]  Well, that's why we've got Turk Pimpkin in here.
[02:01:20.875 --> 02:01:28.722]  Not because he's a writer or on TV or in movies, but Turk Pimpkin is with us because he's actually gone to Africa.
[02:01:28.742 --> 02:01:29.743]  He's actually gone to India.
[02:01:29.763 --> 02:01:30.984]  He's actually gone to the third world.
[02:01:31.244 --> 02:01:32.385]  He's actually showing what's happening.
[02:01:32.405 --> 02:01:33.986]  He's actually trying to put water systems in.
[02:01:34.266 --> 02:01:37.849]  He's actually trying to get powerful Nobel laureates to speak out and get involved.
[02:01:37.889 --> 02:01:39.151]  I don't know how he got so many.
[02:01:39.471 --> 02:01:41.833]  It's an amazing film that we'll be discussing coming up.
[02:01:42.593 --> 02:01:46.275]  Jason, Burmess, to Dylan and Corey and everybody, I salute you.
[02:01:46.995 --> 02:01:47.636]  Great job.
[02:01:47.776 --> 02:01:48.816]  It feels so good.
[02:01:49.336 --> 02:02:02.283]  After two years, you guys making this, me involved, executive producing the last year, and all the places we traveled, the things we did, to finally see this getting ready to come out, I feel like a huge stress level is going to be lifted off of us.
[02:02:02.303 --> 02:02:02.943]  How are you feeling?
[02:02:03.658 --> 02:02:04.699]  I'm feeling great, Alex.
[02:02:04.739 --> 02:02:06.940]  Like you said, a huge stress level being lifted.
[02:02:07.361 --> 02:02:09.762]  I'm just excited for this information to get out there.
[02:02:09.802 --> 02:02:13.144]  Hopefully, you know, people are going to buy their copy and make dozens of copies.
[02:02:13.425 --> 02:02:18.328]  Hopefully they're going to sit their families down at Christmas dinner, at Thanksgiving dinner, and go over this stuff.
[02:02:18.368 --> 02:02:19.769]  It's important and we need to do it.
[02:02:20.996 --> 02:02:23.557]  All right, my friends, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:02:23.577 --> 02:02:30.418]  I'm going to get you back on Monday, maybe even pop in on the Sunday show, on the Sunday syndicated show, to discuss this more.
[02:02:30.738 --> 02:02:31.719]  Thank you, Jason Burmess.
[02:02:32.159 --> 02:02:32.819]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:02:33.399 --> 02:02:33.819]  All right.
[02:02:34.179 --> 02:02:34.859]  God bless you, too.
[02:02:34.919 --> 02:02:35.920]  It's so exciting, folks.
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:39.961]  I'm going to have to go pop some champagne here, but I don't need that for my fat belly.
[02:02:40.281 --> 02:02:42.101]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:45.682 --> 02:02:47.082]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:48.163 --> 02:02:49.163]  A new world order.
[02:02:49.913 --> 02:02:54.934]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:02:54.994 --> 02:02:56.575]  It's known as the Builderbergs.
[02:02:56.595 --> 02:02:59.876]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:03:00.416 --> 02:03:02.877]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:03.597 --> 02:03:10.959]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:18.901]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:19.401 --> 02:03:22.884]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:23.245 --> 02:03:25.787]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:25.827 --> 02:03:26.788]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:26.808 --> 02:03:27.749]  They're not after money.
[02:03:27.769 --> 02:03:28.830]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.050 --> 02:03:29.471]  They're after power.
[02:03:29.511 --> 02:03:31.072]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:05:57.823 --> 02:06:01.724]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.004 --> 02:06:06.125]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.286 --> 02:06:13.187]  Just to start this interview off with a story, I, uh,
[02:06:16.051 --> 02:06:24.117]  It's about 10 o'clock at night.
[02:06:24.177 --> 02:06:24.998]  I was kind of out of it.
[02:06:25.038 --> 02:06:27.160]  All of a sudden, I came out giving a speech.
[02:06:27.180 --> 02:06:29.502]  They said, hey, Willie Nelson just came by and was over looking at the table.
[02:06:29.882 --> 02:06:31.443]  So I get all, oh my gosh, Willie Nelson.
[02:06:31.463 --> 02:06:33.605]  So I run back to the office, get in game, because it wasn't out yet.
[02:06:34.065 --> 02:06:35.847]  And I go give it to Willie.
[02:06:35.867 --> 02:06:38.028]  And then at the end, he came up and said hi.
[02:06:38.088 --> 02:06:40.470]  And we're out there swarming around with like 200 people.
[02:06:40.530 --> 02:06:44.394]  And I see Turk Pipkin, who I'd met a few times and knew.
[02:06:45.314 --> 02:06:45.935]  I don't think so.
[02:07:01.432 --> 02:07:05.354]  And I finally got a copy of his film that came out last year, Nobility.
[02:07:05.694 --> 02:07:09.015]  And that's not nobility, it's nobility, like the Nobel Prize.
[02:07:09.935 --> 02:07:15.597]  And then I went back to his car with him, he gave me a copy, and I saw these incredible photographs he'd taken as well.
[02:07:16.317 --> 02:07:28.522]  And I was like, these guys are a really good photographer, and I'd already looked him up on IMDB, and I mean, you name it, on TV, big roles on The Sopranos, Idiocracy, Infamous, and Scanner Darkly.
[02:07:29.242 --> 02:07:30.122]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:07:55.793 --> 02:07:56.534]  I don't know.
[02:08:14.262 --> 02:08:26.231]  And if you go up to Infowars.com, there is a link to his website, and that's KirkPipkin.com, and Pipkin spelled P-I-P-K-I-N, Turkish is T-U-R-K, pretty easy, KirkPipkin.com.
[02:08:26.591 --> 02:08:33.677]  But you can also go to the Nobility Project's website, Nobility.org, N-O-B-E-L-I-T-Y.
[02:08:34.297 --> 02:08:39.121]  And you can watch the trailers there, and the proceeds go towards a lot of really
[02:08:40.747 --> 02:08:59.300]  I hope as listeners you will go get his DVD because this type of alternative stuff that you don't see on national TV, I think it should be on HBO or something, needs to be seen and people need to know, especially Americans and Westerners who have gotten pretty decadent, how the rest of the world, or 80 plus percent of the world, is actually living.
[02:09:01.081 --> 02:09:01.501]  We're good to go.
[02:09:26.047 --> 02:09:27.688]  Well, let's just go ahead and go to Turk Pipkin.
[02:09:27.728 --> 02:09:30.249]  Turk, and also I want to talk about the book with Willie Nelson later.
[02:09:30.269 --> 02:09:31.470]  I mean, I've got to get you back in.
[02:09:31.530 --> 02:09:33.071]  An hour is not enough.
[02:09:33.111 --> 02:09:33.871]  Turk, thanks for coming in.
[02:09:34.071 --> 02:09:35.032]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:09:35.072 --> 02:09:36.092]  It's a pleasure to be here.
[02:09:36.153 --> 02:09:36.473]  You bet.
[02:09:36.593 --> 02:09:37.093]  An honor.
[02:09:37.393 --> 02:09:37.793]  Thank you.
[02:09:37.813 --> 02:09:44.297]  Hey, you guys were talking about the new film of 9-11 last hour, and Novelity came out of 9-11.
[02:09:44.357 --> 02:09:51.601]  I mean, my family, I'm married, we've got two kids, and my wife and I and my kids, we sat around after and we were, like everybody else, we were devastated.
[02:09:51.621 --> 02:09:54.282]  And in as many ways, it came out of America's response to 9-11.
[02:09:55.503 --> 02:09:55.783]  I think so.
[02:10:20.639 --> 02:10:24.464]  I thought there might be a smarter way to go out there and to talk to some really smart people.
[02:10:24.864 --> 02:10:26.125]  In this case, Nobel laureates.
[02:10:26.145 --> 02:10:34.234]  Those are the smartest ones I could find and see what they thought about where we are in the world and where we're going and whether there's anything that maybe, any way we could put things back on track.
[02:10:35.973 --> 02:10:37.174]  What was the process?
[02:10:37.194 --> 02:10:39.997]  I mean, your film is very iconoclastic, very deep.
[02:10:40.097 --> 02:10:43.039]  I mean, it's hard to... I like things that are hard to put a label on.
[02:10:43.359 --> 02:10:48.003]  I mean, how did you get the idea first, and then how did you get... How many Nobel Prize winners?
[02:10:48.083 --> 02:10:55.048]  There's nine Nobel laureates in the film, but I'm continuing to do, through the Nobility Project, through our non-profit, I'm continuing to work with Nobel laureates.
[02:10:55.088 --> 02:11:00.112]  So I just came back from Bangladesh, was filming with Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year.
[02:11:00.672 --> 02:11:01.733]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:11:21.867 --> 02:11:23.007]  Multifaceted knowledge.
[02:11:23.027 --> 02:11:31.870]  Multifaceted knowledge, and very good at conveying, in layman's terms, what he sees, the way he sees the world, and the way he sees science.
[02:11:32.490 --> 02:11:47.694]  And I thought, man, if Weinberg can talk like that, I'll bet the rest of these guys and women that you think are a bunch of pointy-head geeks, or they're a bunch of Nobel Peace Prize winners that you couldn't ever get to, I'll bet they'd be delighted to talk to the everyday people about the way they see the world.
[02:11:48.334 --> 02:11:49.075]  Turns out they are.
[02:11:58.287 --> 02:12:09.014]  But it was also incredible to see the places you went, and the cinematography, and the photographs, and the humanity of realizing that these are human beings, and they have lives.
[02:12:09.294 --> 02:12:26.505]  You know, it's an amazing thing, one thing people say, we show the film at a lot of schools, we have a Novelity in Schools program, but it's been in theaters, colleges, all around, people see it on DVD, but the one comment I get is that people go, wow, I just had no idea the world looked like that, and you realize, wait, we don't ever see the rest of the world
[02:12:27.225 --> 02:12:32.729]  Pretty much at all, unless it's maybe in a Hollywood movie, or if there's a natural disaster, or if there's a war.
[02:12:32.929 --> 02:12:35.431]  Well, Americans travel less than any other western nation.
[02:12:35.791 --> 02:12:39.074]  I think a third of the people have a passport.
[02:12:40.294 --> 02:12:43.237]  In general, the widespread media, you know, you just don't go
[02:12:44.057 --> 02:12:45.078]  I think so.
[02:13:03.690 --> 02:13:08.953]  He is an expert in food supplies and famine and populations and human rights, women's rights.
[02:13:10.514 --> 02:13:14.415]  He was a master at Trinity College when I spoke to him, even though I interviewed him at his home in India.
[02:13:15.416 --> 02:13:16.497]  He's actually at Harvard now.
[02:13:16.557 --> 02:13:23.340]  But when I went to India to see Sin, I was smart enough to take some time to try to find the other things I'm looking for.
[02:13:23.380 --> 02:13:24.621]  I really didn't know what those things were.
[02:13:24.641 --> 02:13:26.121]  I wanted to go to India and shoot.
[02:13:26.141 --> 02:13:27.162]  So this film was a journey?
[02:13:27.602 --> 02:13:28.503]  This film was a journey.
[02:13:28.523 --> 02:13:30.025]  It's not like where you write a script and go do it.
[02:13:30.245 --> 02:13:42.359]  And I got to Calcutta, my friend Vance Holmes is a great shooter in Austin, the two of us got to Calcutta and we ended up shooting with street kids everywhere we went because everywhere you go in India there are street kids by the thousands and they're absolutely amazing.
[02:13:43.079 --> 02:13:58.234]  And I just I had no idea there were 25 million orphans in India that there are millions of kids living on the street and they're doing their best to deal with the situation but it's a it's a very difficult one for them and so that's that's launched for me a very big connection.
[02:13:58.254 --> 02:14:02.878]  I mean seeing video of five-year-olds taking care of two-year-olds.
[02:14:03.138 --> 02:14:04.079]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[02:14:04.259 --> 02:14:09.384]  And, you know, at the bottom line though, you look at all those kids in the nobility, they're smiling.
[02:14:09.644 --> 02:14:13.688]  I mean, they see my camera, they just light up like no kid you ever saw before.
[02:14:13.708 --> 02:14:14.388]  That's another question.
[02:14:14.428 --> 02:14:17.151]  This wasn't high budget, but it came out looking so high budget.
[02:14:17.211 --> 02:14:23.797]  How did, because, I mean, I saw the cameras you were shooting on, nice, you know, Sony digital HD cameras, but how did you get such rich colors?
[02:14:23.817 --> 02:14:25.378]  It looks like film.
[02:14:25.718 --> 02:14:28.321]  Well, you know, it's funny, we had a review on one of the
[02:14:28.781 --> 02:14:28.861]  Wow!
[02:14:28.881 --> 02:14:29.041]  I didn't
[02:14:48.434 --> 02:14:50.155]  We shot a lot of footage.
[02:14:50.175 --> 02:14:52.817]  I'm into this now, that's why I'm talking my head off.
[02:14:52.857 --> 02:14:56.699]  We had a brilliant editor in Austin, Chet Hirsch, over at 501 Post.
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:14:58.741]  501 did a lot of work.
[02:14:59.221 --> 02:15:01.142]  We spent almost a year working on this movie.
[02:15:03.081 --> 02:15:13.155]  You know, if you're asking people to sit down and watch interviews, and it's not just interviews, but if there are a lot of interviews in this film, you want to give them a cinematic experience to go with it, or they're going to watch half of it and say it's like 60 minutes.
[02:15:13.836 --> 02:15:15.819]  You know, they can watch 60 minutes on TV.
[02:15:15.939 --> 02:15:18.643]  I was trying to make a movie, and I thought we did a pretty good job of it.
[02:15:19.446 --> 02:15:21.007]  Well, it seems like a charmed project.
[02:15:34.791 --> 02:15:35.312]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:15:55.851 --> 02:15:57.091]  This guy says, so what should we do?
[02:15:57.111 --> 02:15:58.752]  We've been shooting for all this time in Calcutta.
[02:15:58.772 --> 02:16:00.152]  Why don't you take us someplace now?
[02:16:00.332 --> 02:16:01.612]  We're not really speaking in English.
[02:16:01.692 --> 02:16:02.932]  We're kind of doing the best we can.
[02:16:03.172 --> 02:16:05.473]  Take us to see something you want us to see and drop us off.
[02:16:05.913 --> 02:16:16.255]  So this guy took us to the Muharram, which is one of the largest holy festivals of the Muslim world, and it's a giant pilgrimage celebrating Hussein.
[02:16:16.315 --> 02:16:17.735]  It's a long story.
[02:16:17.775 --> 02:16:19.235]  The grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.
[02:16:19.895 --> 02:16:21.496]  I didn't really know what this festival was going to be like.
[02:16:21.516 --> 02:16:22.316]  What it was like was 200,000 Muslims.
[02:16:23.456 --> 02:16:24.136]  I don't know.
[02:16:44.349 --> 02:16:45.690]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:17:03.428 --> 02:17:05.169]  And I felt so bad about lying to him.
[02:17:05.189 --> 02:17:07.031]  I went over to him and I said, I want to tell you something.
[02:17:07.451 --> 02:17:11.994]  It's like that moment in a sitcom where it's really loud and everybody gets quiet and some guy says, I'm gay!
[02:17:12.014 --> 02:17:14.296]  And they clap.
[02:17:14.576 --> 02:17:17.138]  Well, it got really quiet right when I said, I'm an American!
[02:17:17.158 --> 02:17:20.921]  And about 5,000 people all turned and looked at me.
[02:17:22.642 --> 02:17:23.563]  Nothing happened to me.
[02:17:23.663 --> 02:17:24.744]  These people didn't want to hurt me.
[02:17:25.982 --> 02:17:31.667]  They, and they were certainly aware, there were plenty of placards out there about the war, they were certainly aware of who I was and where I was from.
[02:17:31.787 --> 02:17:32.187]  Amazing!
[02:17:32.328 --> 02:17:40.074]  They didn't see me as George Bush, which I guess is my point, and I felt it was my obligation to not see them as a bunch of terrorists, which obviously they aren't.
[02:17:40.234 --> 02:17:44.438]  Turk Bivkin, amazing folks, we've got 40 minutes left with him, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:17:45.265 --> 02:17:45.925]  We're good to go.
[02:17:46.006 --> 02:17:46.206]  I think?
[02:18:04.737 --> 02:18:06.578]  A $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[02:18:06.618 --> 02:18:08.840]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[02:18:08.900 --> 02:18:13.783]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[02:18:13.843 --> 02:18:16.285]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[02:18:16.405 --> 02:18:20.807]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders is skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[02:18:21.168 --> 02:18:21.568]  The U.S.
[02:18:21.608 --> 02:18:25.991]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[02:18:26.071 --> 02:18:27.852]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[02:18:28.292 --> 02:18:31.054]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.

[02:18:34.996 --> 02:18:38.218]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.

[02:18:38.578 --> 02:18:38.758]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.359 --> 02:18:54.031]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[02:18:54.792 --> 02:18:59.778]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[02:19:00.479 --> 02:19:06.464]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and in World War I and World War II?
[02:19:07.185 --> 02:19:15.612]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.

[02:19:47.249 --> 02:19:47.530]  Look!
[02:19:47.930 --> 02:19:48.991]  Up there in the sky!
[02:19:49.412 --> 02:19:50.733]  It's Non-X-Man!
[02:19:51.113 --> 02:19:52.274]  He's in a dive!
[02:19:52.575 --> 02:19:54.577]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[02:19:54.857 --> 02:19:55.577]  Let's go look!
[02:19:57.845 --> 02:20:01.027]  I'm Non-X-Man, and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[02:20:01.448 --> 02:20:02.789]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:20:03.009 --> 02:20:03.469]  Take them out.
[02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:04.770]  Let's see.
[02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:09.373]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:20:09.694 --> 02:20:10.174]  Don't worry.
[02:20:10.634 --> 02:20:12.135]  Now there's Non-X nail gel.
[02:20:12.776 --> 02:20:17.179]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:20:17.719 --> 02:20:19.781]  Oh, I will, Non-X-Man.
[02:20:19.901 --> 02:20:22.603]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:20:24.728 --> 02:20:27.389]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:20:27.849 --> 02:20:31.330]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:20:31.850 --> 02:20:42.974]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Lawns, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:20:45.245 --> 02:20:52.048]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:20:52.408 --> 02:20:58.811]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:20:59.291 --> 02:21:09.195]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:21:09.675 --> 02:21:13.077]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:21:13.437 --> 02:21:16.119]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:19.442]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[02:21:53.952 --> 02:21:58.035]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio
[02:21:59.666 --> 02:22:04.549]  Okay, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen, and Turk Pimkin is our guest.
[02:22:04.689 --> 02:22:14.434]  I want you to go to M4Awards.com in the guest section, right on the main page, and you'll see Turk's picture.
[02:22:27.262 --> 02:22:27.783]  Big guy.
[02:22:28.324 --> 02:22:29.185]  And just click on there.
[02:22:29.225 --> 02:22:30.366]  Go watch the trailers.
[02:22:30.967 --> 02:22:31.647]  Check into this film.
[02:22:31.667 --> 02:22:33.490]  I want to save some time for Willie Nelson.
[02:22:33.770 --> 02:22:34.811]  Now, I don't want to spring this on you.
[02:22:34.831 --> 02:22:36.493]  I asked if it was okay right before you came on.
[02:22:36.513 --> 02:22:38.736]  You were in here listening to Jason Burmiss and Loose Change.
[02:22:39.964 --> 02:22:44.047]  And I know that there have been Nobel Prize winners come out and talk about AIDS being engineered now.
[02:22:45.327 --> 02:22:53.692]  I know that some of them have been speaking about false black terror or letting attacks happen, and you said, oh I was talking to a Nobel Prize winner and they were discussing 9-11.
[02:22:53.712 --> 02:22:56.014]  I don't know how far you want to go, Turk, or what you want to say.
[02:22:56.054 --> 02:22:57.114]  Well, they weren't discussing 9-11.
[02:22:57.375 --> 02:23:00.557]  What they were discussing was, and it was about Iran.
[02:23:00.637 --> 02:23:04.639]  We were just listening to the preacher talking about Iran.
[02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:09.662]  Suren Abadi is a lawyer from Iran.
[02:23:09.682 --> 02:23:14.427]  She's a first woman lawyer and first woman Supreme Court Justice in Iran.
[02:23:14.447 --> 02:23:21.916]  She won the Nobel Prize and has had limited ability to travel into the United States because they could look at her.
[02:23:22.076 --> 02:23:24.840]  They did find a letter in the country about a year ago which is when I met her.
[02:23:25.300 --> 02:23:35.674]  She works with the Nobel Women's Initiative, which is a group of all the women who have won the Nobel Peace Prize, including Aung San Suu Kyi, who my film is dedicated to, who is still under house arrest in Burma.
[02:23:36.054 --> 02:23:39.959]  But the women, except for Aung, were all in L.A.
[02:23:39.999 --> 02:23:40.900]  and I met with them.
[02:23:41.781 --> 02:23:42.062]  I don't know.
[02:24:00.223 --> 02:24:17.019]  Getting into Iraq and by increasing the anti-American sentiment in the Middle East, we drove Iran, which was westernizing and modernizing and coming right in the direction we wanted them to come, to vote for Ahmadinejad and got the last guy we wanted, the guy we really didn't want.
[02:24:17.039 --> 02:24:20.101]  And now putting pressure on Iran only makes him popular.
[02:24:20.222 --> 02:24:41.218]  And, you know, it's just another one of those ways when you don't look at what happened, you know, in my film I say to Dr. Harold Varmus, what could we have done, and it's so funny because at the time, not really funny but so pitiful, at the time, on election day two years ago, we were $140 billion into the Iraq War, and of course now we're ten times that, but I said what could we have done if we'd taken that $140 billion and we spent it on
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:43.920]  We're good to
[02:25:07.532 --> 02:25:11.995]  What was the, of all the places you went in the world, what was the most degraded?
[02:25:12.075 --> 02:25:15.778]  I mean, what area did you see that had the greatest blight on it?
[02:25:16.158 --> 02:25:18.500]  Well, I'm still traveling a lot because I'm shooting a new movie.
[02:25:18.520 --> 02:25:19.820]  I'm shooting a sequel to Novelity.
[02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:21.141]  It's called One Piece at a Time.
[02:25:21.241 --> 02:25:23.743]  The first movie's about problems, the second one's about solutions.
[02:25:23.823 --> 02:25:29.047]  So I've just come back from a couple of long trips to India, Thailand, and Bangladesh.
[02:25:29.087 --> 02:25:32.049]  And Thailand's a country that's, in a lot of ways, has done great things.
[02:25:32.489 --> 02:25:36.452]  They have a tremendous family planning program and they don't mind talking about
[02:25:36.852 --> 02:25:37.234]  I think so.
[02:25:44.125 --> 02:25:47.606]  And when you go buy a condom at the drugstore, you ask for a Mechai.
[02:25:48.946 --> 02:25:49.666]  So it's no big deal.
[02:25:49.686 --> 02:25:54.287]  He goes into schools and blows up condoms as a joke, and people go, oh, birth control is something everybody should talk about.
[02:25:54.587 --> 02:25:58.888]  They went from eight kids a family to 1.8 kids a family, and that's made everything else easier.
[02:25:59.288 --> 02:26:04.189]  Go to Bangladesh, right next door, on the other side of Burma, they haven't had a lot of that.
[02:26:04.229 --> 02:26:05.249]  They have some of that going.
[02:26:05.269 --> 02:26:07.670]  They've had some great microfinance stuff, which is bringing
[02:26:07.810 --> 02:26:12.691]  I want to talk about that micro-finance poverty, but they still have 6-8 kids in their family in the rural areas, and it's killer.
[02:26:12.791 --> 02:26:13.671]  We're about to break.
[02:26:13.731 --> 02:26:16.372]  See, this is what makes me so angry, and this is what Endgame covers.
[02:26:17.252 --> 02:26:23.853]  Once a country industrializes, they end up having about 1.5 children, like Europe and Japan's doing.
[02:26:23.893 --> 02:26:35.215]  But instead, the Royal Commission on Population, commissioned by the King of England, 44 to 49, says that they actually want to keep those nations from getting water and infrastructure
[02:26:36.055 --> 02:26:50.358]  And just so they're not an industrial or military threat to the West, and then it actually causes huge balloons in population of people to die, and they claim they're doing that to reduce population, and it actually just ends up having a larger population and then more of them dying.
[02:26:50.398 --> 02:26:52.899]  It's almost like it just causes more death.
[02:26:53.099 --> 02:27:00.281]  Well, right now, you know, the United States, we tie our AIDS and preventable disease and our family planning money that goes into Africa.
[02:27:00.341 --> 02:27:01.821]  We're spending a lot of money in Africa.
[02:27:01.861 --> 02:27:03.982]  When I made this movie, we were spending hardly anything.
[02:27:04.002 --> 02:27:05.062]  They're finally coming up and
[02:27:05.822 --> 02:27:07.063]  It's not as much as we should be.
[02:27:07.083 --> 02:27:10.846]  It's still probably the lowest of any industrialized nation as a percentage of our GNP.
[02:27:10.866 --> 02:27:11.807]  But we are spending money.
[02:27:12.067 --> 02:27:13.148]  But it all has strings.
[02:27:13.188 --> 02:27:18.032]  So when we go over there and we talk about family planning or prevention of AIDS... It's the type that the big guys want.
[02:27:18.052 --> 02:27:19.493]  It's all tied to contraception.
[02:27:19.773 --> 02:27:21.034]  To abstinence.
[02:27:21.454 --> 02:27:23.255]  It's not tied to... Stay there, Turk.
[02:27:23.275 --> 02:27:23.696]  We've got a break.
[02:27:23.716 --> 02:27:25.477]  We're going to come back and get into that more.
[02:27:25.497 --> 02:27:27.118]  But also, the microfinance.
[02:27:27.158 --> 02:27:28.019]  You interviewed nine of them.
[02:27:28.059 --> 02:27:28.980]  Nine different subjects.
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:30.821]  I want to hit on some of those other subjects, too.
[02:27:31.281 --> 02:27:31.842]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.788 --> 02:27:38.814]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.736 --> 02:27:42.421]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.712 --> 02:27:49.976]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:27:50.236 --> 02:27:55.120]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:27:55.341 --> 02:27:56.682]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:27:56.842 --> 02:28:00.205]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:28:53.557 --> 02:28:56.118]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:28:56.478 --> 02:29:01.300]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:07.063]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:29:07.363 --> 02:29:10.324]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.

[02:31:51.960 --> 02:31:56.001]  I'm going to have to have you back for a part two.
[02:31:56.021 --> 02:32:07.025]  If you go to InfoWars.com, you can link over to the Nobility Project, and it's just a wide facet of ideas and different ideas that people have for solutions.
[02:32:07.105 --> 02:32:10.946]  Nine Nobel Prize winners, that's quite a feat to get that many interviews.

[02:32:43.548 --> 02:32:47.289]  I mean, I spent about a week and a half ago, like two hours on your site one night.
[02:32:47.369 --> 02:32:48.769]  My wife comes down about 2 a.m.
[02:32:48.789 --> 02:32:49.549]  and goes, go to bed.
[02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:58.891]  But I mean, just the footage, too, that, I mean, again, and I'm glad to see that it's not just me thinking this, because you said critics have noticed how good the video looks.
[02:32:59.091 --> 02:33:00.912]  Yeah, we're pretty pleased with that.
[02:33:00.992 --> 02:33:05.154]  And it's crazy, you know, I travel, unfortunately, doing all this stuff, you know, on a small budget.
[02:33:05.214 --> 02:33:09.877]  So, like these trips I just made to Bangladesh and Thailand and India, I'm traveling solo.
[02:33:09.897 --> 02:33:18.181]  You know, I'm carrying, I got an HD camera, and I got a still camera, and I got all this gear and about 100 pounds of gear on my back, and it rained monsoons the whole time.
[02:33:18.221 --> 02:33:20.622]  I'm underneath an umbrella, walking around in these little villages.
[02:33:22.603 --> 02:33:23.184]  People don't care.
[02:33:23.204 --> 02:33:25.725]  They're like, open up your homes and say, come on in, we're going to tell you my story.
[02:33:25.865 --> 02:33:33.890]  Now, I've always heard when you're overseas, because I'm not that tall, I'm like 5'10", but that if you're over 6'5", you're 6'7", that really, I mean, were you a magnet everywhere?
[02:33:33.930 --> 02:33:37.132]  I'm the Pied Piper for kids in third world countries.
[02:33:37.212 --> 02:33:51.540]  The kids, you know, it starts off, you know, I have these great shots where you just, I'm shooting an empty courtyard and it's really pretty light or something, I just like the light, and I got my video camera going, and then a kid will run by me and get in front of the camera, and then another kid, and another kid, and another kid, within about a minute, there's 80 kids in the shot.
[02:33:52.180 --> 02:33:53.041]  It's just amazing.
[02:33:53.102 --> 02:33:56.245]  And then the next thing I know, everywhere I walk, they're following me through the town.
[02:33:56.345 --> 02:33:58.348]  It's a good thing I don't know how to open up the side of the mountain.
[02:33:58.448 --> 02:34:03.154]  A lot has been written about how Westerners have had so much, have been so blessed.
[02:34:04.793 --> 02:34:08.978]  And, but then are so unhappy because Madison Avenue tells us to feel inadequate to sell us more products.
[02:34:09.298 --> 02:34:23.495]  But to see these children living, you know, right outside open sewers, homeless, you know, bathing in, you know, sewage water, and they have literally the light of God in their eyes, compared to Americans who are driving around in Lexus and BMWs who are unhappy.
[02:34:23.695 --> 02:34:24.535]  Yeah, you know, I'll come back.
[02:34:24.615 --> 02:34:39.659]  I came back at one point from India with a whole lot of photos of kids, and I sat down with a doctor, and he diagnosed the medical problems that these children had, including one girl with this terrible thing on her nose, which he says is Hansen's disease, which is leprosy.
[02:34:40.359 --> 02:34:42.880]  And, you know, here are these kids walking around with no medical care.
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:44.680]  Leprosy is a totally treatable disease.
[02:34:45.400 --> 02:34:46.481]  So there's the tragedy.
[02:34:46.521 --> 02:34:50.421]  On the other hand, on the other hand, is why are our kids so stressed, so freaked out?
[02:34:53.169 --> 02:35:02.195]  These kids are living in such really difficult situations and hungry a lot of times and generally seem so happy and I think that we do have something to learn from the other world.
[02:35:02.235 --> 02:35:06.758]  I just interviewed this guy who founded in Delhi a guy who founded a thing called the Hole in the Wall.
[02:35:06.778 --> 02:35:13.502]  They put computers in the sides of buildings for kids to use and they get on the internet and they teach themselves about the world through these computers.
[02:35:13.562 --> 02:35:14.583]  It's absolutely amazing.
[02:35:15.143 --> 02:35:15.224]  Yes.
[02:35:25.836 --> 02:35:32.059]  This gentleman, Sugata Mitra, I asked him, is it reasonable to expect we can bring electricity and internet to every village in the world?
[02:35:32.099 --> 02:35:34.380]  And he said, every village in the world doesn't need electricity.
[02:35:34.840 --> 02:35:37.081]  We always want to put our values on these villages.
[02:35:37.782 --> 02:35:43.084]  They deserve, you know, food and health care and a way to make a living, but they don't need to live like us.
[02:35:43.664 --> 02:35:48.146]  If they want to, they may choose to, but we can't, you know, it's not something we should feel this obligation to take.
[02:35:48.186 --> 02:35:49.127]  Microfinance.
[02:35:49.227 --> 02:35:51.708]  Microfinance is a way that you bring this
[02:35:52.428 --> 02:35:52.968]  We're good to go.
[02:36:20.401 --> 02:36:24.586]  There's no, you know, you don't have to sign over something that you own like you do here.
[02:36:24.606 --> 02:36:27.230]  And it's not some big global multinational bank.
[02:36:27.410 --> 02:36:28.692]  Well, the people own this bank.
[02:36:28.852 --> 02:36:30.294]  It's all stockholder owned.
[02:36:30.334 --> 02:36:31.355]  It's owned by the depositors.
[02:36:31.375 --> 02:36:34.079]  You have to open a savings account to borrow from Grameen Bank.
[02:36:34.099 --> 02:36:34.920]  See, that's what your film does.
[02:36:34.980 --> 02:36:37.123]  It isn't one ideology or one idea.
[02:36:38.344 --> 02:36:44.207]  It's all these different people with different perspectives and a whole bunch of ideas, and it really just spurs more thought.
[02:36:44.227 --> 02:36:49.189]  Well, Grameen Bank is a business owned by the people, and it is as libertarian as you could possibly get.
[02:36:49.229 --> 02:36:51.871]  They don't take foreign aid to make this stuff happen.
[02:36:51.911 --> 02:36:52.771]  It's all funded by them.
[02:36:52.791 --> 02:36:53.451]  No, that's beautiful.
[02:36:53.512 --> 02:36:54.172]  I totally support it.
[02:36:54.192 --> 02:36:58.834]  And they use the profits to create health care for them and to do for their own lives.
[02:36:58.914 --> 02:37:00.235]  It's an absolutely amazing program.
[02:37:00.255 --> 02:37:02.396]  The payback rate on these notes
[02:37:03.336 --> 02:37:07.758]  99%.
[02:37:03.897 --> 02:37:07.758]  Can you imagine if any bank in America had 99% payback rate?
[02:37:07.778 --> 02:37:10.320]  We're getting 25% defaults now in this country.
[02:37:10.340 --> 02:37:29.689]  Yeah, they have 1% default, and what they do when somebody defaults, they go to them and they say, you know, obviously you're having a problem paying your loan, and instead of foreclosing and taking something that you own, I'm going to take your chickens or your cow or your bicycle, you go to them and say, maybe we should loan you some more money and spread the payments out over a longer period of time so you can get well or you can get beyond whatever your problem is.
[02:37:29.709 --> 02:37:30.830]  It's not predatory lending.
[02:37:30.930 --> 02:37:37.553]  Yeah, no, it's totally, the purpose is to enable the poor to help themselves.
[02:37:37.933 --> 02:37:48.518]  Now, shifting gears, and I've studied this not as much as you or Willie or his wife Annie, but I know that ethanol does take a lot of corn and then they... And a lot of water to grow the corn.
[02:37:48.738 --> 02:37:50.219]  And a lot of water, and that it's...
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:54.802]  And now, you know, they even admitted it's starting to cause famines worldwide.
[02:37:55.323 --> 02:37:59.666]  Brazil, they're making it, they're making it here, and then people say, oh, well, then, see, Willie Nelson's doing a bad thing.
[02:37:59.746 --> 02:38:00.226]  No, no, no, no, no.
[02:38:00.266 --> 02:38:01.207]  You guys researched this.
[02:38:01.247 --> 02:38:01.627]  Willie did.
[02:38:01.988 --> 02:38:12.155]  This is biodiesel that takes waste products that would have just been dumped out and taken energy to get rid of, and this localizes it even into the cities, not just the rural areas.
[02:38:12.376 --> 02:38:14.237]  I mean, explain biodiesel.
[02:38:14.437 --> 02:38:15.918]  Ethanol, of course, you're, you know, you're growing.
[02:38:15.958 --> 02:38:16.799]  And you covered that in the film.
[02:38:16.819 --> 02:38:17.980]  The film covers alternative energy.
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:18.660]  I think so.
[02:38:37.985 --> 02:38:38.265]  I think?
[02:38:57.068 --> 02:38:57.768]  We're good to go.
[02:39:21.002 --> 02:39:25.205]  But whatever you use to make the biodiesel, it has to be a sustainable product.
[02:39:25.225 --> 02:39:29.868]  A lot of people that make biodiesel, they're running grease traps.
[02:39:29.908 --> 02:39:33.231]  They're just taking recycled French fry oil.
[02:39:33.251 --> 02:39:35.272]  Which they were just dumping in the landfill.
[02:39:35.292 --> 02:39:36.153]  This is the incredible thing.
[02:39:36.733 --> 02:39:39.115]  These are also like micro-Bruges.
[02:39:39.195 --> 02:39:40.597]  This is inexpensive to set up.
[02:39:41.037 --> 02:39:41.898]  It works well.
[02:39:42.198 --> 02:39:45.361]  It breaks that monopoly that the big oil companies have.
[02:39:45.641 --> 02:39:52.127]  And so they've, I've noticed, put out a lot of news articles creating confusion, lumping biodiesel into ethanol when it's completely separate.
[02:39:52.407 --> 02:40:02.758]  Yeah, and there's been, you know, actually, there's moves afoot to try to, for the corporate world, to grab biodiesel and create restrictions where only the big boys will be able to do it.
[02:40:02.818 --> 02:40:03.579]  See, they're scared of it.
[02:40:03.679 --> 02:40:06.442]  Every rural county in America could have a plant like Willie has.
[02:40:06.702 --> 02:40:09.545]  Will biodiesel solve our energy problem?
[02:40:09.905 --> 02:40:12.228]  No, but is it one of the elements to solve it?
[02:40:12.348 --> 02:40:12.608]  It is.
[02:40:12.768 --> 02:40:14.449]  It's an example like wind power.
[02:40:14.569 --> 02:40:21.593]  Totally clean, it is decentralized, and I'm hearing right now in Congress they're trying to shoot that down.
[02:40:21.633 --> 02:40:27.476]  Well, today in Congress the word is out that they're trying to pull the solar and the wind provisions out of the new energy bill.
[02:40:28.056 --> 02:40:36.040]  And Rick Smalley is a Nobel laureate in the movie, he's a Nobel chemist, he's the discoverer of the buckyball, which is really the beginning of nanotechnology.
[02:40:36.540 --> 02:40:37.261]  Thank you, Bill.
[02:40:55.243 --> 02:40:59.588]  That's a major plant, like a coal plant you'd see or a gas plant that they're building these days.
[02:40:59.668 --> 02:41:06.215]  It's one like that that you would open every day, every day, week after week, month after month, for 27 years.
[02:41:06.255 --> 02:41:09.179]  That's my problem with this is, there's this huge environmental movement.
[02:41:09.219 --> 02:41:12.162]  It's got great people, loving, caring, intelligent people.
[02:41:12.582 --> 02:41:15.826]  All the real things that would do good get blocked or censored or controlled or
[02:41:16.767 --> 02:41:21.531]  Well, you know, changing light bulbs is a great idea, but it's going to take a lot more than changing light bulbs.
[02:41:21.571 --> 02:41:26.354]  And we use a lot of energy, and if the whole world used as much energy as we did, the world would be in trouble indeed.
[02:41:39.190 --> 02:41:46.141]  We're going to have to conserve, we're going to have to find every way we can to use less energy, but we're also going to have to produce a lot more clean energy.
[02:41:46.181 --> 02:41:49.386]  And solar, in the long term, solar is going to be the big key.
[02:41:50.729 --> 02:41:59.771]  Ten times as much solar power hitting the earth as we consume every day, and we can grab a small, I mean there's a thousand times more, I'm sorry, we can grab a small percentage of that.
[02:41:59.891 --> 02:42:02.492]  It's expensive right now, but we need to be putting... It's getting cheaper though.
[02:42:02.592 --> 02:42:05.133]  It's getting cheaper and we need to be putting big money into solar.
[02:42:05.573 --> 02:42:11.935]  Every time somebody puts panels on their roof, every time... Well they put thousands of times into weapons development that they put into solar.
[02:42:11.975 --> 02:42:12.695]  Yeah, if we put one
[02:42:13.055 --> 02:42:13.355]  I think so.
[02:42:36.929 --> 02:42:37.629]  on the military.
[02:42:37.969 --> 02:42:42.991]  The film is Nobility, N-O-B-E-L-I-T-Y.
[02:42:43.451 --> 02:42:46.812]  The website is Nobility.org.
[02:42:47.572 --> 02:42:54.655]  And if you go to Infowars.com, if you forget the URL, Nobility.org, you can link through right there throughout the weekend.
[02:42:54.675 --> 02:42:57.936]  We'll have that link up there on the main page.
[02:42:58.616 --> 02:43:00.257]  I hope people will get this DVD.
[02:43:00.597 --> 02:43:01.697]  It spurs you to think.
[02:43:01.737 --> 02:43:04.178]  A lot of the ideas, they say, I agree with.
[02:43:04.278 --> 02:43:05.318]  Some of the ideas, I don't.
[02:43:05.418 --> 02:43:07.119]  Others, it spurs me to thought.
[02:43:07.159 --> 02:43:08.779]  I like things that challenge me.
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:11.220]  I'm really into trying to grow my brain.
[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:13.561]  I'm not that smart, but I'm getting a little smarter every day.
[02:43:13.581 --> 02:43:15.502]  I know how much I don't know.
[02:43:15.542 --> 02:43:16.622]  The more you learn, the more you don't know.
[02:43:16.662 --> 02:43:20.863]  The old cliche goes, shifting gears in the 10-15 minutes, Turk, we've got left.
[02:43:21.163 --> 02:43:22.484]  Willie Nelson, you're good friends with him.
[02:43:23.264 --> 02:43:24.264]  My mother absolutely loves him.
[02:43:24.344 --> 02:43:24.704]  I love him.
[02:43:24.725 --> 02:43:25.345]  My dad loves him.
[02:43:25.385 --> 02:43:26.805]  I grew up, I've seen him many times.
[02:43:27.265 --> 02:43:35.467]  And just at the movie the other night, you guys were there doing something at another film, and then to have Willie come over and get to talk to him and say, hey, I like what you're doing.
[02:43:35.487 --> 02:43:37.368]  And then he sees a huge crowd and he kind of goes.
[02:43:38.328 --> 02:43:40.569]  But I mean, he really, he had a presence.
[02:43:40.589 --> 02:43:43.229]  And I've been around presidents and movie stars and other people.
[02:43:43.770 --> 02:43:49.191]  And I really don't think I've ever run into anybody, and the word is Zen.
[02:43:49.815 --> 02:43:58.318]  Yeah, that's why he seems so... because everybody kind of gets quiet around me, and I look over, Willie Nelson had come around the counter, and he was standing there just looking at me, and I felt this presence.
[02:43:58.338 --> 02:43:59.559]  It was like Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[02:44:00.039 --> 02:44:03.680]  And I turn around, and it's Willie Nelson looking at me to, you know, shake my hand.
[02:44:04.301 --> 02:44:11.183]  And, I mean, it was like a questioning, analyzing, piercing... I mean, I'm not being cheesy here, folks.
[02:44:11.404 --> 02:44:12.304]  Can you talk about that?
[02:44:12.364 --> 02:44:14.345]  And then you wrote the book in the exhibit.
[02:44:14.365 --> 02:44:15.145]  I wrote it with Willie.
[02:44:15.225 --> 02:44:16.727]  Yeah, it's called the Tao of Willie.
[02:44:27.621 --> 02:44:34.943]  Willie knows who he is more than any other person I've ever met in my life, and there's never a moment that Willie doesn't know who he is or how he fits in the situation.
[02:44:34.983 --> 02:44:46.905]  We all kind of wander around in a fog, but Willie always knows who he is, and he always knows it unless somebody has done something specifically to prove otherwise that they're a friend of his, which is an amazing perspective to take on life.
[02:44:47.205 --> 02:44:51.526]  Willie's never a guy who, for instance, like all of us who'd be in traffic and somebody cuts you off, and he'd be going,
[02:44:52.586 --> 02:44:56.847]  You know, the guy cuts Willie off, and Willie's like, that guy must really be in a hurry.
[02:44:57.127 --> 02:44:58.128]  And then it's gone.
[02:44:58.208 --> 02:44:59.348]  He never gives it another thought.
[02:44:59.368 --> 02:45:00.108]  He's a true Texan.
[02:45:00.328 --> 02:45:03.929]  And he is... I mean, would you call him a personified Texan?
[02:45:03.949 --> 02:45:05.390]  You know, he is a true Texan.
[02:45:05.430 --> 02:45:07.270]  He is, in many ways, the definitive Texan.
[02:45:07.290 --> 02:45:09.311]  And this book starts, and it's really great.
[02:45:09.511 --> 02:45:17.773]  Just because I've known him, I've been writing about him and taking notes and remembering things from poker games and golf and one thing or another over the years and always writing things down.
[02:45:17.853 --> 02:45:21.814]  So when I finally went back and said, let's do this book, and Willie said, that sounds like a blast, let's do it.
[02:45:23.052 --> 02:45:32.475]  I went back and I started, I mean I wrote about why I think Willie's so great at the very beginning, but with Willie I started with this guy in a little town in Texas, and who's saying, you know, I grew up in Abbott, Texas.
[02:45:32.495 --> 02:45:33.395]  He grew up just north of here.
[02:45:33.455 --> 02:45:40.517]  Yeah, in a little town of Abbott, in a small town, you know, and my grandparents raised me, and I didn't appreciate at the time all this.
[02:45:40.737 --> 02:45:48.799]  They taught me how to look somebody in the eye and respect your elders, and remember people's names, and shake their hand firmly, and then as I got older I began to realize that stuff really does matter.
[02:45:49.079 --> 02:45:51.520]  Well, that's a really simple kind of down-home, down-spun quote.
[02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:54.702]  Well, that's where the book begins.
[02:45:54.782 --> 02:46:00.406]  The end of the book is Willie Nelson, 74 years old, saying, I don't fear death because there is no death.
[02:46:01.066 --> 02:46:07.030]  And that's the kind of Baptist to Buddhist arc of Willie Nelson, but the Texas thing rides on top of it all the way through.
[02:46:07.050 --> 02:46:08.271]  He really is an amazing guy.
[02:46:09.211 --> 02:46:10.132]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[02:46:11.052 --> 02:46:12.433]  I mean, you know him, too.
[02:46:12.453 --> 02:46:14.194]  You're in the scanner, but I know Keanu Reeves.
[02:46:14.274 --> 02:46:16.016]  I know Woody Harrelson.
[02:46:16.076 --> 02:46:17.797]  I know the Sheens.
[02:46:17.837 --> 02:46:18.517]  I know so many people.
[02:46:18.537 --> 02:46:20.158]  They're all great folks and have great presence.
[02:46:22.310 --> 02:46:28.535]  I mean, so many people I've had a chance to run into, but I mean, literally, I felt Willie Nelson's presence.
[02:46:28.555 --> 02:46:31.778]  Yeah, it's really something, and the book was a great opportunity.
[02:46:31.858 --> 02:46:49.412]  I was actually writing this book at the same time I was making Nobility, and it's a peace book, and it really is a peace film, and I actually appreciate you a minute ago, you were saying, if you don't agree with everything in the film, it doesn't matter because it's making you think anyway, and I never expect everybody to agree with everything my Nobel laureates and some dummy from Texas are going to say.
[02:46:50.372 --> 02:46:50.873]  I think so.
[02:47:09.877 --> 02:47:11.959]  It really is a peace book, like it's a peace film.
[02:47:11.979 --> 02:47:13.360]  Let me add something here.
[02:47:13.580 --> 02:47:20.585]  When the Dixie Chicks criticized Bush, and rightly so, they were able to demonize him, but the establishment didn't dare attack Willie Nelson.
[02:47:20.605 --> 02:47:36.436]  They tried a little bit, and I heard Willie on the radio, some clip on the news, somebody asked him about it, and he said, he just said, well, look, it's all going to come out, this war is bad, and you know what, they're talking about not playing some of my stuff on the radio, you know, I just don't care.
[02:47:37.128 --> 02:47:38.789]  I mean, I'm going to tell the truth and that's the end of it.
[02:47:38.829 --> 02:47:41.510]  I'm paraphrasing what I heard him say, but I mean, what's his whole view on the war?
[02:47:41.550 --> 02:47:50.114]  Well, I don't know, I can't know about saying his view on the war, but Willie is, you know, Willie is, you may have seen a t-shirt that says, I'm already against the next war?
[02:47:50.374 --> 02:47:50.634]  Yes.
[02:47:51.334 --> 02:47:55.076]  That's Willie, and we've never solved any problems.
[02:47:55.156 --> 02:47:56.497]  We go to war to fight.
[02:47:56.577 --> 02:47:58.718]  You cannot earn the peace by going to war.
[02:47:58.778 --> 02:47:59.718]  It only makes more problems.
[02:47:59.978 --> 02:48:09.743]  It doesn't mean that there haven't been wars that we thought that didn't have to be fought, but we were never really making any progress at this point by fighting wars.
[02:48:10.063 --> 02:48:13.305]  Willie comes down on the side of peace, and he really believes that we should have.
[02:48:13.325 --> 02:48:14.666]  We spent all this money on the...
[02:48:15.632 --> 02:48:17.693]  Department of War, we should have a Department of Peace.
[02:48:18.453 --> 02:48:29.858]  And that it should be a cabinet-level position, and that anytime you're gonna go start a war with somebody, you gotta say, okay, before you start this war, we gotta go to the, you know, to the guy who's the head of the Department of Peace, and we gotta see what kind of solution they're willing to offer.
[02:48:29.878 --> 02:48:32.299]  Well, we know we're run by those that love the war paradigm.
[02:48:32.659 --> 02:48:39.563]  There's not that much money to be made in peace, but if you know the truthfully, the money is not made in the short term, it's made in the long term by a peaceful planet.
[02:48:39.623 --> 02:48:41.503]  The Dow of Willie.
[02:48:41.523 --> 02:48:44.165]  Go to Amazon.com and get it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:44.185 --> 02:48:44.585]  Stay with us.
[02:48:44.625 --> 02:48:45.145]  Final segment.
[02:48:46.050 --> 02:48:47.451]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:47.471 --> 02:48:49.572]  A New World Order.
[02:48:50.292 --> 02:48:54.474]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.175 --> 02:48:57.956]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:57.996 --> 02:49:00.257]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:00.798 --> 02:49:03.239]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:03.979 --> 02:49:11.323]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.329 --> 02:49:19.272]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:19.572 --> 02:49:23.274]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:23.634 --> 02:49:26.155]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:26.195 --> 02:49:27.336]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.356 --> 02:49:28.136]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.156 --> 02:49:29.197]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.437 --> 02:49:30.177]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.197 --> 02:49:31.258]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[02:50:44.930 --> 02:50:46.772]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:50:46.912 --> 02:50:52.097]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:50:52.257 --> 02:50:53.598]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:50:53.878 --> 02:51:02.046]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:51:02.266 --> 02:51:08.011]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:51:08.151 --> 02:51:09.933]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:51:10.013 --> 02:51:12.175]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:51:12.195 --> 02:51:16.539]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:51:16.719 --> 02:51:18.881]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:51:18.961 --> 02:51:26.709]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:51:27.862 --> 02:51:28.303]  I think so.
[02:51:59.955 --> 02:52:03.337]  We'll go right back to Mr. Pipkin here in just a moment.

[02:52:44.203 --> 02:52:50.088]  They've got another big line of great nutritive products, so be sure and check that out.
[02:52:50.448 --> 02:52:53.811]  Turk, I've got to ask you to come back and do another hour interview sometime.
[02:52:54.431 --> 02:52:55.731]  I really appreciate you coming in.
[02:52:56.112 --> 02:52:57.232]  We've got a few minutes left.
[02:52:57.532 --> 02:52:58.972]  The book, The Dow of Willie.
[02:52:58.992 --> 02:53:00.413]  Now, I just got a copy from you last week.
[02:53:00.433 --> 02:53:01.113]  I haven't read it yet.
[02:53:01.573 --> 02:53:02.654]  It's a beautiful little book.
[02:53:04.414 --> 02:53:07.655]  Just in the few minutes we've got left, walk through some of the things that are in that book.
[02:53:07.895 --> 02:53:09.936]  Well, you know, there's a lot of things in the book.
[02:53:09.996 --> 02:53:12.297]  It's really Willie's philosophy of life.
[02:53:14.157 --> 02:53:37.535]  You know, from some of it funny, some of it very, very serious, and it covers a range of, it talks about biodiesel, it talks about energy, it talks about, it actually talks a little bit about Electoral College and how we've pretty much outgrown its functionality and that we've really come to a time where one person, one vote is going to be something this country needs.
[02:53:37.615 --> 02:53:43.420]  By the way, dig up a Willie Nelson song, dig up a Highwaymen song, let's go out with that today in the last minute.
[02:53:43.940 --> 02:53:45.301]  John, tell me if you have time to grab that.
[02:53:45.321 --> 02:53:45.801]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:53:45.941 --> 02:53:46.661]  Oh, yeah, that's great.
[02:53:46.721 --> 02:53:49.002]  Next time I come in, I'm going to bring in Willie's new version.
[02:53:49.042 --> 02:53:51.843]  He recorded Dave Matthews' song, Grave Digger.
[02:53:52.103 --> 02:53:52.943]  Oh, wow, I haven't heard that yet.
[02:53:52.963 --> 02:53:54.944]  And it is absolutely chilling.
[02:53:55.024 --> 02:53:58.406]  I've got probably 900 Willie songs in my eye.
[02:53:58.666 --> 02:53:59.706]  I apologize for interrupting.
[02:53:59.746 --> 02:54:01.347]  They can go to Amazon.com.
[02:54:01.707 --> 02:54:03.587]  You can get Nobelity at Amazon, too.
[02:54:04.328 --> 02:54:09.230]  It's probably a little cheaper if you get it at Amazon, but if you get it at Nobelity.org, it helps our school work.
[02:54:09.470 --> 02:54:10.210]  Let's talk about that.
[02:54:10.250 --> 02:54:13.111]  I mean, you really give almost all this back to the project.
[02:54:13.531 --> 02:54:28.122]  If there's teachers out there and you want to use nobility in the classroom, and there's teachers all over the country and in other countries as well that use nobility in the classroom in a lot of different subjects because we talk about energy and we talk about landmines, we talk about health care, and there's a lot of issues that apply.
[02:54:28.602 --> 02:54:31.104]  You go to Novelity.org, there's a Novelity in Schools site.
[02:54:31.224 --> 02:54:33.386]  You click on that site and there's two check boxes.
[02:54:33.486 --> 02:54:34.426]  One says, I'm a teacher.
[02:54:34.827 --> 02:54:35.968]  I want to get a copy of the movie.
[02:54:36.048 --> 02:54:36.868]  Use it in my classroom.
[02:54:36.908 --> 02:54:39.710]  I got 25 bucks of classroom resources I can pay for it.
[02:54:39.770 --> 02:54:40.851]  The other one says, I'm a teacher.
[02:54:40.871 --> 02:54:42.132]  I want a copy of the movie.
[02:54:42.172 --> 02:54:43.553]  I don't have any classroom resources.
[02:54:43.613 --> 02:54:44.394]  Send me one anyway.
[02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:46.236]  Wow, that's a total honor system, man.
[02:54:46.276 --> 02:54:51.260]  I was kind of thinking on the idea that maybe 50% of the teachers could pay and that would cover the ones who didn't.
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:53.442]  It didn't work out that way, but that's okay anyway.
[02:54:53.462 --> 02:54:53.923]  I don't care.
[02:54:53.963 --> 02:54:57.446]  If you're a teacher and you want to get a copy of the movie, go sign up for the Nobility in Schools program.
[02:54:57.466 --> 02:54:59.408]  But please, folks, if you don't have the money, don't do that.
[02:54:59.588 --> 02:55:01.389]  We have a full-time... Well, you've got to be a teacher.
[02:55:01.409 --> 02:55:02.470]  You've got to put in your class.
[02:55:02.490 --> 02:55:05.013]  You've got to be the... You know, it's... No, I don't care about that.
[02:55:05.033 --> 02:55:06.274]  Don't take advantage of that again.
[02:55:06.694 --> 02:55:12.620]  No, it's a certified program and we need you in the database so we can send those teachers educational materials that come with it.
[02:55:12.640 --> 02:55:19.086]  We have an educator now who works with me to develop more materials to take this stuff into the classroom.
[02:55:19.766 --> 02:55:20.807]  Kids do amazing stuff.
[02:55:20.847 --> 02:55:24.851]  We had an international baccalaureate class at Westwood High last year, an IB program.
[02:55:25.789 --> 02:55:36.253]  They spent a whole year studying based on what they had seen in this movie, a whole year of study, and they also raised $5,000 for a landmine campaign based on this film.
[02:55:36.313 --> 02:55:40.375]  Presented me a giant check to pass on for landmine victims.
[02:55:40.855 --> 02:55:42.556]  And that's a lot of money for a high school kid.
[02:55:42.596 --> 02:55:45.377]  People see this movie and they say, I want to do something, and they get connected.
[02:55:45.917 --> 02:55:50.140]  You can also go to TurkPibkin.com, link up on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:54.523]  The Dow Willey co-authored with Turk, and of course, Nobility.org.
[02:55:55.044 --> 02:55:56.385]  Turk, again, I want to thank you for coming in.
[02:55:56.405 --> 02:55:57.165]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:55:57.946 --> 02:55:58.847]  Keep up the good work, man.
[02:55:58.867 --> 02:55:59.247]  We need you.
[02:55:59.367 --> 02:56:00.047]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:00.087 --> 02:56:06.132]  We'll go out with Willie, Waylon, and of course, Chris Christopherson, and the immortal Johnny Cash.
[02:56:06.172 --> 02:56:06.872]  God bless you all.
[02:56:06.892 --> 02:56:10.955]  See you Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m., and of course, back on Monday.
[02:56:10.995 --> 02:56:11.436]  God bless.
[02:56:11.576 --> 02:56:12.476]  Keep up the good fight.
[02:56:12.817 --> 02:56:13.317]  We'll try.
[02:56:13.477 --> 02:56:13.997]  Thank you, Turk.
[02:56:15.038 --> 02:56:19.903]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:56:19.963 --> 02:56:24.447]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
