[00:00:05.777 --> 00:00:06.437]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.078 --> 00:00:08.178]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:09.959]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:11.439]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.140]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.581]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:22.023]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:29.498]  No, it's not live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:51.467]  This is Bob Dacey, once again, sitting here in the command chair of the Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, substituting for Alex Jones once again, because the boy needs a well-deserved rest, and I understand that he's gone off somewhere with his family for a few days, and therefore, yours truly, Bob Dacey,
[00:00:52.728 --> 00:00:57.370]  I was going to be doing the show here today and Monday and Tuesday.
[00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:08.094]  I'm going to do it a little bit different this time than I've done it before because I didn't get quite as much notice to prepare for it and I decided, well, I'll just kind of wing it this time.
[00:01:08.154 --> 00:01:21.259]  I'll do kind of, maybe today after I get a few things off my chest, I'll just read some news articles and talk about the latest chapter in the war against the North American Union and the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.211]  And you know, we're going to wing it that way.
[00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:32.374]  For those of you who don't know who I am, I am a local merchant here in Austin, Texas.
[00:01:32.414 --> 00:01:38.536]  I have the hardware store incorporated at Spotswood Springs Road and 183 in Northwest Austin.
[00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:39.136]  I'm just like
[00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:43.526]  I'm the hardware guy in Austin.
[00:01:43.586 --> 00:01:48.609]  I'm the guy that tells you how to fix your toilet and how to hook up your electrical wire and all that other stuff.
[00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:50.110]  That's what I do for a living.
[00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.214]  I also sell Alex Jones products in my store.
[00:01:57.314 --> 00:01:57.855]  Not all of them.
[00:01:57.975 --> 00:02:03.038]  I mostly just concentrate on the DVDs and the old VHS stuff.
[00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:14.059]  You know, if you are in the Austin area and you want to come visit us, if we're in Northwest Austin, you can come visit us and, you know, buy some of Alex Jones' stuff for me.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.744]  You know, we've got everything all the way up to the newest edition of Terror Storm.
[00:02:20.965 --> 00:02:25.108]  We don't have Endgame yet, but that, of course, is coming soon.
[00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:32.494]  And, of course, we're going to be talking about Endgame a little bit later on in the show because this is Alex Jones' latest, greatest production
[00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:53.395]  And I've known Alex since 1998, and every year he puts something out, his learning curve is fantastic, and he's gotten better and better and better at the content, the accuracy, the technique, the editing, the special effects, you name it.
[00:02:54.635 --> 00:02:59.638]  This guy is at the top of his game, and in this case, the top of the endgame.
[00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:09.303]  And so you need to go to Infowars.com and click on the store and start pre-ordering in-game for sure.
[00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:12.704]  Because I know it's fantastic.
[00:03:12.744 --> 00:03:13.765]  I haven't even seen it yet.
[00:03:13.785 --> 00:03:14.445]  I don't know.
[00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:19.147]  Every other film Alex has put out has been fantastic.
[00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:24.310]  But in-game I'm sure is pièce de résistance or whatever you want to call it.
[00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.951]  So you need to do that.
[00:03:28.115 --> 00:03:35.379]  Anyway, stop by the hardware store if you're in the Austin area, and the rest of you million people out there who aren't, well that's just too bad.
[00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:39.581]  You'll have to buy all your stuff from InfoWars.com, I guess, huh?
[00:03:39.962 --> 00:03:45.345]  And please go there, because it's just vitally important that this information get out.
[00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:55.030]  Now today, the thing I want to discuss in detail is the results of the latest battle
[00:03:56.192 --> 00:03:58.532]  in the war to stop the North American Union.
[00:03:58.672 --> 00:04:09.674]  You know, we have said for years that the Trans-Texas Corridor is a chunk, the first chunk, of the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:04:10.635 --> 00:04:21.596]  And that NAFTA Superhighway is intended to link Canada, United States, and Mexico into one big happy country.
[00:04:22.157 --> 00:04:23.517]  I don't know why that phone is ringing.
[00:04:23.557 --> 00:04:24.297]  I have no idea.
[00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.900]  And we're trying to stop it here.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.662]  You know, if you stop it anywhere, you can stop it here in Texas first, because Texas is the first place.
[00:04:32.683 --> 00:04:33.923]  They're building the darn thing.
[00:04:34.964 --> 00:04:42.907]  So, when we get back, we're going to talk about the latest results of a local vote here in Austin, which has national and international implications.
[00:04:43.508 --> 00:04:48.170]  Once again, this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:05:03.385 --> 00:05:04.425]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:05:04.745 --> 00:05:07.526]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:11.948]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:05:12.388 --> 00:05:13.208]  So what do you do?
[00:05:13.528 --> 00:05:18.090]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.731]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:05:21.211 --> 00:05:35.895]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:42.997]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:05:43.357 --> 00:05:47.781]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:05:48.201 --> 00:05:50.222]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:50.343 --> 00:05:50.743]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:05:52.844 --> 00:05:54.125]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:54.846]  A new world order.
[00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:57.168]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:18.989]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:27.040]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:06:30.043 --> 00:06:35.045]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:39.007]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:06:39.387 --> 00:06:41.888]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:06:41.948 --> 00:06:43.089]  Most people have no idea.
[00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:43.869]  They're not after money.
[00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:44.969]  They have all the money they need.
[00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:45.910]  They're after power.
[00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.910]  That's what happens here.
[00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:51.852]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[00:06:52.052 --> 00:06:55.494]  Or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:55.614 --> 00:06:56.494]  Endgame.
[00:06:56.794 --> 00:06:58.355]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:01.458]  You have been warned.
[00:07:02.498 --> 00:07:06.322]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself.
[00:07:06.721 --> 00:07:08.462]  So that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[00:07:08.982 --> 00:07:11.382]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[00:07:11.843 --> 00:07:19.585]  Now there's Night Skin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[00:07:20.125 --> 00:07:26.707]  Night Skin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[00:07:27.167 --> 00:07:30.528]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging,
[00:07:30.948 --> 00:07:32.389]  And fight natural sun damage.
[00:07:33.049 --> 00:07:34.650]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.352]  Try NightSkin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed both inside and out.
[00:07:40.692 --> 00:07:43.433]  Try NightSkin risk-free by calling 1-800-894-3418.

[00:07:48.635 --> 00:07:50.856]  Turning back the clock has never been this easy.
[00:07:51.217 --> 00:07:53.097]  Try NightSkin risk-free today.
[00:07:53.117 --> 00:07:53.518]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:53.578 --> 00:07:53.938]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:06.334]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.714 --> 00:08:08.998]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.057 --> 00:08:16.920]  Yeah, and there's also a war on for your dollars when you're driving on these roads.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.681]  I'll tell you what.
[00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:24.406]  Again, this is Bob Dasey, subsiding for Alex Jones here on this 12th day of October 2007.
[00:08:25.246 --> 00:08:29.069]  And again, I want to get into this toll road stuff again because it is so important.
[00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:31.591]  First, a little amusing story here.
[00:08:31.631 --> 00:08:37.295]  This is out of the American Statesman, our local globalist rag that we have here in Austin.
[00:08:38.687 --> 00:08:39.588]  Told twice.
[00:08:39.668 --> 00:08:43.550]  Officials say antenna problems caused 50,000 double billings.
[00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:52.173]  See here in Austin they've got some of these stupid toll roads set up already and apparently the little cameras are screwing up and when you drive by they ding you twice.
[00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:54.454]  50,000 double billings.
[00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:57.296]  This is by being aware of the American Statesman staff.
[00:08:57.856 --> 00:09:05.900]  A glitch in the equipment on three Austin toll roads has caused about 50,000 double billings since charges began in January, TXO said Monday.
[00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:09.773]  Gee, well, you know, why not?
[00:09:10.073 --> 00:09:24.006]  My comment on that, rather than getting into all the boring minutiae of this article, my comment on that is, well, you know, they're already wanting to charge us again for roads we already paid for when they slapped tolls on them, so why not charge us twice to do that?
[00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:24.667]  I mean, why not?
[00:09:24.727 --> 00:09:28.730]  You know, they're already double billing us once, so why not double bill us twice?
[00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:34.090]  Seriously, this thing about the toll road thing in Austin, and I'm going to talk about Austin.
[00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:35.911]  You're saying, well, what does it have to do with the national stuff?
[00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:38.131]  It has everything to do with the national stuff.
[00:09:38.211 --> 00:09:38.492]  All right.
[00:09:39.432 --> 00:09:41.613]  Austin is the center of Texas.
[00:09:41.773 --> 00:09:47.614]  Austin is the area where they're starting to build the first chunk of the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:09:47.714 --> 00:09:50.475]  It's Highway 130 east of Austin.
[00:09:50.515 --> 00:09:56.237]  The first two segments being built by Sintra, the Spanish toll road building company.
[00:09:57.382 --> 00:10:10.238]  And if you don't believe that SH-130 is part of the NAFTA Superhighway, not part of the Trans-Texas Corridor, then you better go ask Grupo Ferrovial, the builder of the thing.
[00:10:10.438 --> 00:10:16.245]  Grupo Ferrovial is the parent company of Sintra, and on their website they very plainly state
[00:10:16.878 --> 00:10:23.461]  That Highway 130 is the first contract awarded for the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:10:23.501 --> 00:10:29.203]  I don't want to hear any nonsense people out there saying, no, that's totally unrelated and y'all are a bunch of nuts.
[00:10:29.563 --> 00:10:34.725]  See, the deal is, the people that are building it think that it's part of the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:10:34.985 --> 00:10:38.887]  So I think that should pretty well put that little controversy to rest.
[00:10:39.702 --> 00:10:43.103]  Anyway, okay, so we got this local tolling thing going on.
[00:10:43.143 --> 00:10:45.704]  That's supposed to be separate from the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:48.325]  That's local improvements around Austin.
[00:10:48.465 --> 00:10:53.447]  But it's not local improvements around Austin because it's related to the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:10:53.807 --> 00:11:02.931]  And that's why it's so important, because you watch what goes on here in the Austin area, you can see what they're going to try to pull everywhere else to get this Napa Superhighway built.
[00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:08.373]  In the states, and we had an article a couple of days ago, toll road plan cruises onward.
[00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:17.926]  And despite the fact that we, the people of the Capital Area, have told our local governmental officials who are responsible for voting this
[00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:43.117]  These improvements and getting the federal and state money to do it despite the fact that we've told them over and over again by like 93% overwhelming margins that we don't want to have toll roads on right-of-way we already paid for we don't want that despite the fact they keep shoving it down our throats well the other day there was a vote
[00:11:43.737 --> 00:11:50.882]  There was a vote on Monday to see if our elected officials were going to listen to us or to somebody else.
[00:11:52.082 --> 00:11:59.927]  And well, gee, there was a big meeting at the local high school and there's 19 members on this board called the Campo Board.
[00:12:01.008 --> 00:12:10.234]  And despite overwhelming opposition to tolling roads we already paid for, the scoundrels voted in it anyway.
[00:12:11.636 --> 00:12:25.219]  You know, and I had made the comment at a public meeting last month at State Capitol that if our public officials don't listen to us, then where is this local control nonsense?
[00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:25.879]  What is that?
[00:12:26.299 --> 00:12:28.160]  I call it the illusion of local control.
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.920]  They say, no, everything's going to be controlled locally.
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.061]  You don't have to worry about that.
[00:12:32.081 --> 00:12:33.601]  You know, you're going to have your input there.
[00:12:33.901 --> 00:12:38.282]  So we give our input and our elected officials blow us off.
[00:12:39.048 --> 00:12:42.191]  They just blow us off and you gotta kind of wonder why.
[00:12:43.031 --> 00:13:00.325]  And we have a real good example of that here, which on first blush is just out and out treasonous, I guess, or traitorous, but then you gotta study it, because this political stuff is more complicated than just black and white.
[00:13:01.146 --> 00:13:06.390]  And that's what I want to talk about today and some of the first hour before we start taking phone calls.
[00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:24.965]  About a year and a half ago, Sal Costello, who is one of the biggest fighters against the toll roads in Texas, he's got a website called TexasTollParty.com and he has a real good blog, Sal Costello Blog Spot.
[00:13:26.341 --> 00:13:40.772]  And he's always chronicling what's going on, trying to stop TxDOT and CAMPO, the local area people, from tolling roads we already paid for, or for slapping toll roads on top of right-of-way we already paid for.
[00:13:41.712 --> 00:13:49.658]  Well, anyway, we decided, well, what do you do to these political officials when they decide they're going to toll your roads?
[00:13:50.436 --> 00:13:51.496]  Well, you take them out.
[00:13:51.917 --> 00:13:54.838]  So Karen Sundlantner was the example.
[00:13:55.878 --> 00:14:05.862]  Sal Costello and his allies, in I think it was March of last year, there was a Democratic primary election in Travis County.
[00:14:06.462 --> 00:14:15.506]  And a woman by the name of Karen Sundlantner, who was a 10-year incumbent Democrat in a liberal county in Texas, was running for re-election.
[00:14:16.826 --> 00:14:18.327]  Sal Costello and his people
[00:14:19.259 --> 00:14:25.844]  Uh, painted her in the papers as a toll queen because she had voted to toll roads we already paid for.
[00:14:25.864 --> 00:14:32.889]  They had a big picture of her in a tolling queen outfit with a sash on and a crown and money dripping out of everywhere.
[00:14:32.969 --> 00:14:34.690]  And it was all true.
[00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:40.514]  I mean, there was nothing, nothing, um, untrue about the ads because she had voted to toll roads we already paid for.
[00:14:41.114 --> 00:14:46.558]  And as a result, uh, this 10 year incumbent county commissioner got blown out of the water
[00:14:47.358 --> 00:14:49.740]  By an opponent in her own primary.
[00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:51.522]  In her own primary.
[00:14:51.702 --> 00:14:52.202]  And it was like 60%, 40%.
[00:14:53.844 --> 00:14:54.624]  She got clobbered.
[00:14:55.385 --> 00:15:02.812]  And this was supposed to be a shot across the bow of any elected representative who just doesn't want to listen to us.
[00:15:03.112 --> 00:15:05.254]  When we don't want these roads to stall.
[00:15:05.834 --> 00:15:07.015]  So, great!
[00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:07.836]  You know, it was a great victory.
[00:15:07.876 --> 00:15:14.382]  Well, she was replaced by another county commissioner, the woman who won the seat, Sarah Eckert.
[00:15:15.976 --> 00:15:23.738]  So Sarah Eckert is now the County Commissioner of Precinct 2, and she's on this CAMPO board replacing Karen Sunlightner.
[00:15:24.459 --> 00:15:26.859]  And so what happened on October the 8th?
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:41.564]  Sarah Eckert, who was put into office because of everybody going after Karen Sunlightner and her toll queen status, she ran as an anti-toll candidate.
[00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:43.491]  I mean, that was her platform.
[00:15:43.931 --> 00:15:47.034]  So I, I personally, I usually vote Republican.
[00:15:47.054 --> 00:15:47.354]  Okay.
[00:15:47.854 --> 00:15:50.216]  Cause that's how I grew up as a conservative Republican.
[00:15:50.956 --> 00:16:06.328]  I actually, for the first time in my life, switched parties in the prime to go vote in the democratic primary for Sarah Eckert so that I could help get rid of the toll queen.
[00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.650]  I actually did that.
[00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:12.140]  And so what happened on October the 8th?
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:16.422]  First chance Sarah Eckert gets, she votes to tow the roads!
[00:16:18.724 --> 00:16:19.804]  I'm like, wait a minute!
[00:16:20.805 --> 00:16:21.325]  Time out?
[00:16:22.306 --> 00:16:22.906]  What gives?
[00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:24.387]  I don't understand this.
[00:16:25.207 --> 00:16:28.249]  You know, again, you want to talk about the illusion of local control.
[00:16:28.269 --> 00:16:39.035]  I mean, if you throw the bum out who wants to tow the roads, and then you put the new person in who says they don't want to tow the roads, and the first chance they get, they vote to tow the roads!
[00:16:40.572 --> 00:16:41.373]  What's going on here?
[00:16:41.393 --> 00:16:44.635]  You know, so at first blush, it's like, what is going on?
[00:16:44.655 --> 00:16:45.816]  Hey, wait, just a minute here.
[00:16:46.477 --> 00:16:54.403]  But things are not as cut and dried or as simple as you might think.
[00:16:54.663 --> 00:16:56.084]  It's more complicated than that.
[00:16:57.405 --> 00:17:02.009]  And I'm going to discuss what happened there.
[00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:06.052]  And basically what I did was I called Sarah Eckert yesterday.
[00:17:07.153 --> 00:17:07.793]  And I know her.
[00:17:07.853 --> 00:17:08.734]  We've met a few times.
[00:17:08.754 --> 00:17:09.615]  So we've discussed this.
[00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:14.874]  She's a liberal Democrat and I'm a crazy right-wing extremist wacko.
[00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.795]  But, you know, we've talked.
[00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:22.536]  I've met with her in her office and I've seen her at a public meeting here and there.
[00:17:23.176 --> 00:17:23.616]  Talked to her.
[00:17:24.156 --> 00:17:26.797]  And so she was kind enough to take my phone call.
[00:17:27.837 --> 00:17:31.498]  And I wanted her explanation for why she did what she did.
[00:17:31.698 --> 00:17:32.018]  Why
[00:17:32.938 --> 00:17:39.603]  Would someone who ran as an anti-toll candidate immediately vote to toll roads?
[00:17:39.623 --> 00:17:42.184]  At first blush, it was ridiculous.
[00:17:42.224 --> 00:17:47.268]  And again, why I'm dwelling on this is because this is nationally important.
[00:17:47.508 --> 00:17:47.988]  That's why.
[00:17:48.589 --> 00:17:58.315]  Because again, Austin is the front-line battle in the front-line state to stop the funding of the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:17:59.116 --> 00:17:59.476]  That's it.
[00:18:00.333 --> 00:18:04.475]  So, this is like, you know, Shiloh during the Civil War.
[00:18:04.535 --> 00:18:06.276]  This is where we are right now.
[00:18:06.876 --> 00:18:08.597]  Or Gettysburg or wherever you want to pick.
[00:18:09.017 --> 00:18:21.963]  We're in this battle and it's important because, again, my globalist friends are going to be trying to replicate any success they have in other states and that's why it's important.
[00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:25.271]  Basically, here's the deal.
[00:18:25.992 --> 00:18:27.073]  First blush, what gives?
[00:18:27.493 --> 00:18:28.915]  Well, according to Ms.
[00:18:28.995 --> 00:18:31.878]  Eckert, and she's a nice lady.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:42.209]  I get the feeling from her that she's sincere and that she's not in the pocket of the highway construction lobby.
[00:18:43.001 --> 00:18:45.062]  I don't get that fitting from her.
[00:18:45.122 --> 00:18:48.704]  I know Karen Sunlightner was taking money from these people like nobody's business.
[00:18:48.744 --> 00:18:51.025]  They were just throwing their parties and all this other stuff.
[00:18:51.045 --> 00:18:53.426]  You know, here, give Karen Sunlightner a bunch of money.
[00:18:53.446 --> 00:18:54.526]  She's going to tow the roads.
[00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:59.769]  I don't think Sarah Eckert is in that situation, so I wanted to talk to her.
[00:18:59.809 --> 00:19:07.912]  So what she told me was, and if I can understand it, was that basically the fix was in at Campa.
[00:19:08.693 --> 00:19:11.754]  There was no way that the anti-towlers
[00:19:12.605 --> 00:19:13.205]  We're going to win.
[00:19:13.265 --> 00:19:14.706]  There's 19 members on the board.
[00:19:15.366 --> 00:19:24.988]  They already had 14 of them for sure are going to ignore the will of the constituents, blow us all off, and vote to tow the roads for whatever reason.
[00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:27.529]  For whatever reason, they were going to do it.
[00:19:28.249 --> 00:19:31.870]  So Sarah's thinking, well, okay, this is a done deal.
[00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:33.571]  They're going to vote to tow the roads.
[00:19:35.305 --> 00:19:46.096]  When we get back from this break, I'm going to try to explain to the best of my ability her rationale for why she also voted to toll these roads.
[00:19:46.596 --> 00:19:54.084]  So once again, this is Bob Dacey substituting for Alex Jones for the Alex Jones Show Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:20:03.490 --> 00:20:07.997]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:20:08.337 --> 00:20:12.443]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:20:12.724 --> 00:20:13.285]  We listened.
[00:20:13.585 --> 00:20:18.573]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:20:18.853 --> 00:20:19.334]  We listened.
[00:20:19.714 --> 00:20:22.756]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:20:23.157 --> 00:20:23.717]  We listened.
[00:20:24.177 --> 00:20:28.241]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:20:28.621 --> 00:20:29.101]  We listened.
[00:20:29.441 --> 00:20:34.685]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:20:35.106 --> 00:20:35.366]  Again,
[00:20:35.926 --> 00:20:36.447]  We listened.
[00:20:36.807 --> 00:20:38.388]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:20:38.588 --> 00:20:44.192]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:20:44.613 --> 00:20:47.255]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[00:20:47.435 --> 00:20:47.655]  Only $279.
[00:20:47.715 --> 00:20:48.736]  Call New Millennium.
[00:20:48.756 --> 00:20:48.836]  888-803-4438.
[00:20:48.856 --> 00:20:49.156]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:20:49.196 --> 00:20:51.238]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:20:51.278 --> 00:20:52.298]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:02.464 --> 00:21:03.525]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:03.926 --> 00:21:09.391]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:21:09.972 --> 00:21:10.472]  That's right.
[00:21:10.792 --> 00:21:13.075]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:21:13.635 --> 00:21:20.562]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:21:21.118 --> 00:21:28.824]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:29.264 --> 00:21:34.048]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:21:34.728 --> 00:21:39.751]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:40.531 --> 00:21:44.673]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:45.293]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:45.313 --> 00:21:47.254]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:21:47.315 --> 00:21:47.635]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.915 --> 00:21:48.195]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.607 --> 00:22:03.669]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:13.240]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.681 --> 00:22:20.889]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.579 --> 00:22:27.081]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:27.561 --> 00:22:38.404]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:39.144 --> 00:22:41.244]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:22:52.707 --> 00:23:03.070]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.550 --> 00:23:08.651]  Did you know that every original document on the federal and state level proves America is a Christian nation?
[00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:12.772]  Did you know that the Supreme Court has undermined our religious heritage?
[00:23:13.496 --> 00:23:17.883]  You can call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine by calling 1-800-516-8736.

[00:23:30.735 --> 00:23:33.096]  David J. Smith of Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:33.576 --> 00:23:41.037]  Did you know that over 700 suitcase bombs were smuggled out of Russia and are in the hands of radicals bent upon America's destruction?
[00:23:41.777 --> 00:23:45.498]  You can call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:47.599 --> 00:23:47.919]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:47.939 --> 00:23:48.099]  Call now.
[00:24:09.975 --> 00:24:13.937]  Yeah, that's what we're all about.
[00:24:14.017 --> 00:24:17.618]  Liberty for our descendants.
[00:24:17.658 --> 00:24:20.199]  Once again, this is Bob Desi.
[00:24:38.482 --> 00:24:46.109]  On the Alex Jones Show on October the 12th, substituting for Alex who is on a well-deserved mini-vacation, the boy needs some rest, all right?
[00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:57.079]  Again, before the break, we're talking about why one of our local officials who ran on a platform of not tolling roads, first chance she got, she voted to sell the roads.
[00:24:58.082 --> 00:25:01.064]  This is Sarah Eckert, County Commissioner, Precinct 2.
[00:25:01.644 --> 00:25:05.806]  Okay, let me see if I can explain this from her viewpoint.
[00:25:06.307 --> 00:25:24.577]  She said that the fix was in on the deal, that the anti-toll side, the good side, the right side, the righteous side, the pro-America side, the anti-New World Order side, the anti-NAFTA superhighway side, the anti-TTC trans-Texas corridor side was going to lose.
[00:25:25.677 --> 00:25:27.138]  You know, the political fix was in.
[00:25:28.348 --> 00:25:39.253]  So, what she says is that the vote was going to be like four to fifteen, with fifteen voting to toll, with no amendments to the plan.
[00:25:40.034 --> 00:25:42.395]  You know, as rotten as it was, no amendments to the plan.
[00:25:42.995 --> 00:25:50.398]  She wanted a bunch of amendments on there to try to restrict what these people could do and who would run it and all that.
[00:25:51.019 --> 00:25:55.801]  So she said that due to the politics of the situation, which I admit I fully do not understand,
[00:25:56.619 --> 00:26:05.702]  That her amendments would be allowed if she'd back off her opposition to the principle of Colton Rhodes in the first place.
[00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:14.124]  So she got a, the vote would have been 5-14 with her voting against it, but there wouldn't have been any amendments on the deal.
[00:26:15.045 --> 00:26:24.588]  But because of the political machinations that happened, the vote was 4-15 and she got her amendments.
[00:26:26.292 --> 00:26:27.313]  That is what she's saying.
[00:26:28.814 --> 00:26:34.258]  Basically, and this is an admission from Sarah Eckert herself.
[00:26:34.398 --> 00:26:35.639]  I talked to her yesterday on the phone.
[00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:46.166]  She told me, basically, that TxDOT, the Texas Department of Transportation blackmailed the CAMFO board.
[00:26:46.707 --> 00:26:48.288]  That was her words.
[00:26:48.848 --> 00:26:49.469]  Blackmail.
[00:26:49.869 --> 00:26:53.212]  Which she said was a good description for what happened.
[00:26:53.552 --> 00:26:55.093]  Now here's blackmail, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:55.723 --> 00:27:06.986]  This is where TxDOT, who controls this money that they're going to bestow upon us to fix our local roads, TxDOT told them this.
[00:27:07.907 --> 00:27:15.469]  All right, if you vote to toll these roads, we're going to give you $910 million.
[00:27:15.509 --> 00:27:16.830]  How about that?
[00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:23.492]  But if you vote not to toll these roads, we're only going to give you $280 million.
[00:27:25.476 --> 00:27:27.097]  So, there you have it.
[00:27:27.117 --> 00:27:33.281]  You've got a $630 million extortion whatever.
[00:27:34.962 --> 00:27:52.172]  It's kind of like in the movie The Godfather, you know, you've got the mafiosi dude there and he's got this pistol and he sticks it up next to some guy's head and he says, either your signature or your brains are going to be on this contract.
[00:27:53.113 --> 00:27:53.333]  You know?
[00:27:55.885 --> 00:28:07.710]  Basically, the Campo board apparently was just knuckling under, capitulating, bowing to blackmail by tech stock.
[00:28:08.611 --> 00:28:11.792]  I mean, you've got congestion problems in Austin, there's no question about it.
[00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:18.635]  You know, whether the toll roads are going to fix them or not, that's a whole new issue, because I don't think they would anyway, because it's all about revenue generation.
[00:28:19.516 --> 00:28:20.676]  But there you have it.
[00:28:21.217 --> 00:28:22.577]  See, Campo's got cover.
[00:28:22.597 --> 00:28:23.858]  They're saying, well, you know, look,
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:29.504]  We're either going to get $910 million to spend around here or we're going to get $280 million.
[00:28:30.184 --> 00:28:40.552]  And so what they did was they capitulated to the extortion, the blackmail perpetrated on them by TxDOT.
[00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:50.019]  Now, her amendments are good amendments in terms of what they try to restrict this money, how it's going to be spent.
[00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:54.764]  For one thing, they take TxDOT away from controlling the toll road operations.
[00:28:54.964 --> 00:28:55.384]  That's good.
[00:28:56.424 --> 00:29:05.206]  They put the Central Texas Regional Mobility Authority in control of them instead, which is less bad.
[00:29:05.466 --> 00:29:05.766]  Okay?
[00:29:06.586 --> 00:29:08.186]  CTRMA ain't so great either.
[00:29:08.766 --> 00:29:13.327]  But at least you have local crooks running the thing instead of statewide crooks.
[00:29:13.607 --> 00:29:14.167]  That's better.
[00:29:14.207 --> 00:29:16.367]  You theoretically have more control over them.
[00:29:18.408 --> 00:29:19.408]  Under the original plan,
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:27.383]  There was a possibility, and probably a probability, that Spanish Toll Road Company was going to get to run the thing.
[00:29:28.143 --> 00:29:30.084]  And now they're saying no private interests.
[00:29:30.704 --> 00:29:36.207]  So that's a couple of the things that were stuck in this tolling vote.
[00:29:36.747 --> 00:29:39.528]  So once again, when we get back we'll get a little deeper into this.
[00:29:39.548 --> 00:29:43.710]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:29:52.111 --> 00:29:55.097]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.038 --> 00:29:58.723]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.647 --> 00:30:06.228]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:30:06.629 --> 00:30:09.570]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.430]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:17.632]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:30:18.012 --> 00:30:23.394]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:30:23.674 --> 00:30:26.635]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:30:26.835 --> 00:30:27.395]  We're good to go.
[00:30:50.246 --> 00:30:56.967]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:30:58.267 --> 00:31:01.008]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:01.768 --> 00:31:07.249]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:31:07.689 --> 00:31:11.910]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:19.191]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:31:19.631 --> 00:31:26.337]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:31:26.657 --> 00:31:28.278]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:31:28.578 --> 00:31:31.761]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:31:32.041 --> 00:31:34.483]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:31:34.803 --> 00:31:41.529]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:31:41.969 --> 00:31:44.651]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:48.694]  That's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:48.734 --> 00:31:50.515]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.061]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[00:32:04.502 --> 00:32:04.762]  Look!
[00:32:05.182 --> 00:32:06.223]  Up there in the sky!
[00:32:06.663 --> 00:32:07.924]  It's Non-X-Man!
[00:32:07.944 --> 00:32:09.485]  He's in a dive!
[00:32:09.505 --> 00:32:11.807]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[00:32:12.107 --> 00:32:12.867]  Let's go look!
[00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:18.291]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[00:32:18.691 --> 00:32:20.052]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[00:32:20.253 --> 00:32:20.673]  Take them out!
[00:32:21.323 --> 00:32:22.044]  Let's see.
[00:32:24.467 --> 00:32:26.529]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:27.430]  Don't worry.
[00:32:27.871 --> 00:32:29.393]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:32:30.013 --> 00:32:34.439]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[00:32:34.959 --> 00:32:37.042]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[00:32:37.162 --> 00:32:39.865]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[00:32:41.987 --> 00:32:44.629]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:48.572]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[00:32:49.093 --> 00:33:00.341]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[00:33:01.902 --> 00:33:09.448]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[00:33:09.528 --> 00:33:11.149]  No matter how hard you try,
[00:33:16.132 --> 00:33:19.253]  That's right, because we're never going to stop coming after you people.
[00:33:19.293 --> 00:33:19.773]  That's right.
[00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:45.183]  No matter how hard you try, we are going to take down, destroy, dismantle, and wipe out this Trans-Texas Corridor and this NAFTA Superhighway so that we can maintain our national sovereignty and our independence so that the Rockefellers and people of their ilk won't be able to build the infrastructure project that they require to link the United States, Canada, and Mexico in order to make possible
[00:33:45.783 --> 00:33:54.631]  This North American Union garbage, which they are semi-secretly trying to shove down our throats.
[00:33:55.332 --> 00:33:58.975]  And again, that's why this local tolling thing I'm talking about is so important.
[00:33:58.995 --> 00:33:59.795]  Keep that in mind.
[00:34:00.716 --> 00:34:11.746]  Okay, so I was talking about, before the break, I was talking about what Sarah Eckert thinks she has accomplished by sticking these amendments on this local tolling issue.
[00:34:12.711 --> 00:34:22.213]  And one of the things she says is that before the amendments got on there, there was no guarantee of maintenance and improvement of the non-tolled options around the tow-way.
[00:34:22.653 --> 00:34:27.474]  And now there's a guaranteed maintenance and improvement of the non-tolled options around the tow-way.
[00:34:27.494 --> 00:34:28.955]  Now that's interesting.
[00:34:29.015 --> 00:34:30.235]  Theoretically, that's great.
[00:34:30.695 --> 00:34:34.916]  Because TxDOT is as crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[00:34:35.376 --> 00:34:39.717]  TxDOT, a couple of years ago, had the temerity and the audacity
[00:34:40.367 --> 00:34:40.767]  We're good to go.
[00:35:07.054 --> 00:35:09.775]  I mean, it wasn't that language, but that's what it said.
[00:35:10.095 --> 00:35:11.775]  Use discontinuous routes.
[00:35:11.835 --> 00:35:17.797]  Make sure that, you know, that the options of not taking the toll road are not really good.
[00:35:18.357 --> 00:35:21.698]  And limit competing facilities and limit competition.
[00:35:22.159 --> 00:35:27.040]  You know, so, again, the text dot is as crooked as they get.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.221]  And so, this is a good thing, theoretically.
[00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:38.043]  Because what they want to do is force you onto the toll roads, not just suggest you go on, they want to force you on.
[00:35:38.864 --> 00:35:43.585]  So she's trying to make sure that the other roads are well maintained, and of course that's a good thing.
[00:35:44.606 --> 00:35:53.529]  And she also wants to say that if they generate revenue from these toll roads, that the revenue stays right here where it belongs.
[00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:58.155]  Instead of being transferred someplace else in the state, i.e.
[00:35:58.215 --> 00:36:03.640]  Trans-Texas Corridor, NAFTA Superhighway, which is, of course, what TxDOT really wants.
[00:36:04.321 --> 00:36:11.448]  That's why this toll craze is going on all over Texas, is because... Let's get with the bottom line.
[00:36:11.468 --> 00:36:12.909]  Let's go straight to the bottom line.
[00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.553]  I said TxDOT is as crooked as a barrel of snakes.
[00:36:16.673 --> 00:36:17.174]  Well, they are.
[00:36:17.574 --> 00:36:18.455]  They're totally crooked.
[00:36:18.999 --> 00:36:20.180]  Totally crooked.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:21.681]  They're a bunch of liars.
[00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:31.326]  We caught them, what, a couple of months ago asking the federal government to let them tow the interstate system, all the while they told us they never intended to do so.
[00:36:31.766 --> 00:36:33.627]  That was a big stink a couple of months ago.
[00:36:34.288 --> 00:36:36.809]  Yours truly was responsible for that in large part, by the way.
[00:36:36.849 --> 00:36:37.770]  I'm very proud of that fact.
[00:36:39.131 --> 00:36:43.033]  And so was the John Birch Society and the American Magazine, because that's where I posted my story.
[00:36:43.873 --> 00:36:45.754]  www.jbs.org.
[00:36:46.775 --> 00:36:48.376]  However, I digress.
[00:36:50.251 --> 00:36:55.573]  When you get to the bottom line, the Feds is what's driving all of this.
[00:36:56.213 --> 00:37:03.977]  You know, Campo, the local capital area metropolitan planning organization, has got their hand out to TxDOT for money.
[00:37:05.018 --> 00:37:07.999]  But TxDOT has their hand out to the federal government for money.
[00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:11.421]  So when you really want to boil it down, it's a federal thing.
[00:37:14.514 --> 00:37:19.077]  And these people in TxDOT are aware of it, and some of them even like it.
[00:37:19.657 --> 00:37:32.466]  As a matter of fact, Mike Crusey, who is the exceedingly crooked politician who was on the CAMPO board, who got the law passed in Texas back in 2003 to authorize all this tolling.
[00:37:33.066 --> 00:37:34.067]  Yeah, Crusey.
[00:37:34.567 --> 00:37:38.590]  He's the chairman of the House Transportation Committee.
[00:37:39.411 --> 00:37:39.871]  This guy,
[00:37:41.110 --> 00:37:42.110]  He knows what's going on.
[00:37:42.551 --> 00:37:49.173]  He's totally sold out to NAFTA, Superhighway, Trans-Texas Corridor, Globalism.
[00:37:49.213 --> 00:37:52.854]  He's a complete fraud.
[00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:56.615]  I'm looking at a report that he put out.
[00:37:57.855 --> 00:38:07.699]  A report to the House of Representatives, 79th Texas Legislature, House Committee on Transportation, Texas House of Representatives, Interim Report 2004.
[00:38:09.815 --> 00:38:25.238]  With his name on it, Mike Creucy, Chairman, where they're explaining to the 79th Legislature about all this stuff, and he talks about, under the subject of federal programs, he says this, quote, It is important that Congress and the U.S.
[00:38:25.258 --> 00:38:37.140]  Department of Transportation give priority to nationally significant corridor systems already identified as high-priority corridors and that support U.S., Mexican, Canadian,
[00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:41.173]  We're good to go.
[00:39:03.678 --> 00:39:06.760]  In 2003 to authorize the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:39:07.061 --> 00:39:09.583]  So this guy, he knows exactly what's going on.
[00:39:09.643 --> 00:39:12.465]  He loves the NAFTA Superhighway.
[00:39:12.525 --> 00:39:26.136]  He loves the fact that the reason why money is drying up from the feds to fix roads in your local community is because they're diverting it to only their north-south high-priority corridors.
[00:39:26.716 --> 00:39:31.740]  And I want to emphasize corridors because there's 80 of them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:39:32.632 --> 00:39:36.035]  TTC 35 is only one of them.
[00:39:36.095 --> 00:39:36.936]  It's the big mama.
[00:39:36.996 --> 00:39:37.917]  It's one of the trunks.
[00:39:39.018 --> 00:39:40.279]  And so is I-69.
[00:39:40.359 --> 00:39:43.582]  But TTC 35 is the big mama.
[00:39:43.622 --> 00:39:44.303]  It's the trunk.
[00:39:45.484 --> 00:39:46.545]  But it's only one.
[00:39:47.486 --> 00:39:50.228]  You know, the Napa Superhighway thing is not a road.
[00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:54.652]  It's a whole pile of them with a north-south orientation.
[00:39:55.213 --> 00:39:57.795]  And again, what's the purpose of north-south orientation?
[00:39:58.723 --> 00:40:18.648]  Well, you know, economically, it's so that the Communist Chinese goods that are made over there by Walmart can come into Mexico through the Puerto Lazaro Cardenas, which are expanding to 20 times its current capacity, so they can drive straight up through Mexico on roads that we pay for in Mexico, thanks to John Cornyn.
[00:40:18.888 --> 00:40:20.108]  He's trying to get that done.
[00:40:21.508 --> 00:40:24.069]  Go up with no border check, go straight through Texas.
[00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:28.553]  Go to San Antonio, which is going to be an international port.
[00:40:28.593 --> 00:40:44.464]  Go to Kansas City Smart Port, which is going to be an international port, port in the middle of the United States, run by Mexicans, who, again, Mexico is the crookedest country in the Western Hemisphere, and so you're going to have Mexican customs officials running this thing.
[00:40:44.504 --> 00:40:46.146]  Now, that makes a whole heck of a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[00:40:46.526 --> 00:40:49.488]  Anyway, that's what it's all about economically.
[00:40:50.632 --> 00:41:06.477]  Is so that Walmart can lower its transportation and manufacturing costs to get all the communist Chinese slave goods in this country and thus drive more Americans out of work and encourage more industrial production to leave our shores and to take out our middle class.
[00:41:07.297 --> 00:41:08.858]  That's the big picture.
[00:41:08.918 --> 00:41:09.838]  You know, that's what it is.
[00:41:09.898 --> 00:41:10.738]  That's what it's all about.
[00:41:11.579 --> 00:41:17.000]  And so, you know, again, the federal government is what is behind all this.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:19.481]  And the problem is,
[00:41:21.226 --> 00:41:24.089]  That people like Sarah Eckert, I don't think they get it.
[00:41:26.250 --> 00:41:34.718]  She doesn't have any problems with a trade arrangement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, but I guess I haven't done enough work.
[00:41:34.798 --> 00:41:43.606]  We haven't done enough work because she doesn't have any clue that that is only the first chunk of a union which goes way beyond economic.
[00:41:44.727 --> 00:41:47.109]  I mean, this security and prosperity partnership stuff,
[00:41:47.888 --> 00:41:53.570]  It's not just regulating the size of jelly beans as they would have you believe.
[00:41:54.611 --> 00:41:56.171]  It's everything, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:56.231 --> 00:41:56.911]  It's cultural.
[00:41:57.992 --> 00:41:58.972]  It's educational.
[00:42:00.273 --> 00:42:00.953]  It's economic.
[00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:02.974]  It's military.
[00:42:04.034 --> 00:42:09.476]  And the regulations would supersede regulations that the U.S.
[00:42:09.516 --> 00:42:12.157]  Congress has over trade.
[00:42:12.317 --> 00:42:17.079]  And by the way, as an aside, the United States Congress isn't even involved.
[00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:40.807]  You know, they're supposed to regulate foreign trade, but these crooks, and I, you know, I don't like to, you know, mince words, these crooks, George Bush, Dick Cheney, and the people that boss them around, these crooks, David Rockefeller, a traitor, a treasonous traitor who admits that he's a traitor, and he's proud that he's a traitor,
[00:42:41.485 --> 00:42:48.227]  They're the ones doing all this, and it's to create a North American Union.
[00:42:48.287 --> 00:42:52.768]  It's to create, actually, a Western Hemisphere Union eventually.
[00:42:52.788 --> 00:42:59.790]  They're just trying to take three countries now, because they ran into resistance trying to take the whole thing a few years ago with their free trade into the Americas.
[00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:03.811]  But the bottom line, it's not an economic thing only.
[00:43:04.767 --> 00:43:07.368]  That's exactly how they got the European Union started.
[00:43:08.148 --> 00:43:13.809]  It's just going to be a steel thing here, you know, just a little trade deal here and don't worry about it.
[00:43:14.029 --> 00:43:19.331]  And now look what happened to the sovereignty of all the nations in the EU.
[00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:22.492]  Now they're all going, hey, wait a minute, you're taking away our national sovereignty.
[00:43:23.012 --> 00:43:26.052]  And here we've got the ability in the United States.
[00:43:26.113 --> 00:43:26.953]  We know what's happening.
[00:43:26.973 --> 00:43:27.613]  We can see it.
[00:43:28.553 --> 00:43:31.834]  We have a model to look at over there across the pond.
[00:43:32.705 --> 00:43:36.547]  And that's why it's so important, but it is the Feds driving this whole thing.
[00:43:37.388 --> 00:43:51.736]  And so, again, we have a lot more work to do in regard to educating people as to what the big picture is in this North American Union thing.
[00:43:51.796 --> 00:43:54.578]  All this local tolling stuff is to fund it.
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:05.046]  They're taking the money away locally to force money out of your pockets to fix your own problems around here so they can do their north-south high-priority corridors.
[00:44:06.067 --> 00:44:16.434]  And those corridors are necessary to physically link United States, Canada, and Mexico into a North American Union.
[00:44:16.474 --> 00:44:19.596]  So I'm not going to count Sarah Eckhart out.
[00:44:19.956 --> 00:44:22.638]  I think that in her mind she has
[00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:24.050]  I don't think so.
[00:44:46.278 --> 00:44:49.059]  To go after these tollers.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:58.104]  But again, that's why you have a problem locally, because some of these people are just political realists.
[00:44:58.624 --> 00:45:09.769]  And they're going, well, gee, we're going to give up $630 million to tech stock blackmail if we don't agree to slap some toll roads on some of these roads around here.
[00:45:09.949 --> 00:45:13.631]  So, gee, $630 million bucks, man, that's a lot of bucks.
[00:45:14.648 --> 00:45:19.712]  And I don't think they realize the national and international implications of what they're doing.
[00:45:20.892 --> 00:45:28.798]  So, I think here in Austin, we have to work on the Campo board, although two of the members for sure are hopeless.
[00:45:28.898 --> 00:45:31.480]  One of them, of course, is Mike Creasy, total crook.
[00:45:32.961 --> 00:45:42.007]  And the other one is Senator Watson, who is the chairman of the Campo board, one of the biggest snakes in the grass to ever crawl out of the United Nations.
[00:45:42.754 --> 00:45:50.338]  And by the way, he does like to crawl over to the United Nations every once in a while and visit with the New World Order crowd over there.
[00:45:50.378 --> 00:45:54.960]  So basically, he is their little minion here in Central Texas.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:02.243]  He's trying to advance his political career and line his pockets promoting globalism.
[00:46:02.463 --> 00:46:06.505]  So Kirk Watson is, as far as I'm concerned, he's a lost case.
[00:46:06.705 --> 00:46:08.446]  I don't, and Mike Creasy, of course, is.
[00:46:09.215 --> 00:46:15.258]  You know, anybody who spends campaign finance money on skydiving lessons is pretty much, you know, a lost case.
[00:46:15.919 --> 00:46:18.220]  But the rest of them, you know, we've got to go after them.
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.120]  We've got to explain to them.
[00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:20.021]  We've got to educate them.
[00:46:20.061 --> 00:46:22.682]  We've got to show them all the legions.
[00:46:22.862 --> 00:46:35.929]  And I'm talking about legions of proof that this Trans-Texas Corridor thing and all it's tolling is nothing but a funding mechanism to build the NAFTA superhighway.
[00:46:36.934 --> 00:46:54.267]  I mean, you can look at articles that were in the Mexican papers several weeks ago where the governor of Nuevo Leon was talking about how Rick Perry went down there and they're talking about how they're going to be linking up the Mexican highway up there to the Trans-Texas Corridor.
[00:46:54.347 --> 00:46:55.948]  I mean, you know, it's in your face.
[00:46:56.108 --> 00:46:57.509]  It's all over the place.
[00:46:57.569 --> 00:46:58.490]  And of course, they have to.
[00:46:59.931 --> 00:47:05.255]  Because you think Walmart is going to invest a bunch of money with Mexico and the Communist Chinese?
[00:47:05.825 --> 00:47:18.713]  To expand that Port Lazaro Cardenas such that it has a capacity bigger than the support of Houston and not have the road system and the rail system necessary to bring that stuff north.
[00:47:19.194 --> 00:47:28.140]  Man, if you think that you are smoking something, you're absolutely got to be smoking something if you believe that nonsense.
[00:47:29.641 --> 00:47:34.744]  So anyway, Sarah, we're going to be watching you and I appreciate your
[00:47:35.282 --> 00:47:41.085]  You've taken my phone call the other day and again you've still got to answer a question for me because I don't get it.
[00:47:41.865 --> 00:47:50.649]  How do we have local control of these issues if TxDOT is holding a gun to our head and we don't have any economic choices in the matter?
[00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:57.992]  So anyway, that's about all I want to say about that and then we'll get on to other things.
[00:47:58.686 --> 00:48:07.895]  What we're going to do probably for the rest of the hour is I'm going to be reading some news stories, maybe talk about Ron Paul a little bit, pick out some stuff in the news.
[00:48:09.797 --> 00:48:13.260]  Oh, I do want to say something else that I forgot to mention.
[00:48:14.501 --> 00:48:16.984]  My TV show is called The Simple Truth.
[00:48:17.584 --> 00:48:22.269]  It's a cable access show that's now in its ninth year here in Austin.
[00:48:23.378 --> 00:48:25.160]  We, you say, well that's local.
[00:48:25.220 --> 00:48:25.860]  No, it's not.
[00:48:25.900 --> 00:48:26.701]  We've gone global.
[00:48:27.402 --> 00:48:28.162]  And this is very important.
[00:48:28.182 --> 00:48:32.346]  Y'all need to write this down because, you know, we do this for fun.
[00:48:33.647 --> 00:48:38.050]  Kelly Taylor, Jeff Kantoff, and I are The Simple Truth.
[00:48:38.110 --> 00:48:41.593]  We're the ones that produce and I'm the host of the show.
[00:48:42.774 --> 00:48:45.716]  And we are now on Google Video.
[00:48:46.577 --> 00:48:49.719]  And for about, oh, six or eight weeks now, we've been on Google Video.
[00:48:49.739 --> 00:48:50.360]  And all you gotta do
[00:48:51.147 --> 00:48:59.274]  Get on your computer, go to Google Video, and type in Bob Dacey, that's D-A-C-E-Y, Simple Truth.
[00:48:59.654 --> 00:49:06.000]  Just type that into Google Video and pop, up come all the shows, and you can watch the Simple Truth whenever you want to.
[00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:18.250]  You know, it's about an hour show, and I know that due to the efforts of Lance Morgan, who is a friend of mine and an associate of mine who knows all this computer stuff, he's the guy doing all this, and it's totally independent of us.
[00:49:18.931 --> 00:49:19.792]  And that's what I'm talking about.
[00:49:19.812 --> 00:49:23.734]  You've got this spirit of volunteerism, where people are getting together and doing stuff.
[00:49:24.234 --> 00:49:35.481]  And now, because of his efforts, we've got our show, which now has the capacity for an international audience, even though it's just a local cable TV access show.
[00:49:36.362 --> 00:49:39.904]  And so I want to thank Lance Morgan for doing that.
[00:49:40.024 --> 00:49:42.906]  But you people go to Google Video.
[00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:52.392]  And click on, you know, you go to Google, then you click on the video button, and then you tap in Bob Dacey, Simple Truth, and you can watch the show.
[00:49:52.452 --> 00:49:58.495]  Pretty soon we're going to have a website up that's going to have it all linked up, you know, some kind of a Simple Truth something or other website.
[00:49:58.735 --> 00:49:59.696]  We're working on that!
[00:50:00.816 --> 00:50:07.140]  And we've done a lot of work over the last eight years, and I'll tell you what, it's like a never-ending flow of information.
[00:50:07.960 --> 00:50:11.282]  And in terms of our political affiliation,
[00:50:14.076 --> 00:50:20.618]  I'm the guy that sits there in front of the camera and does all the talking because I'm not afraid of a camera, I guess.
[00:50:23.498 --> 00:50:31.401]  If you want to talk about where we're at, we're kind of a cross between Alex Jones and the John Birch Society, kind of right in the middle.
[00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:38.343]  Because all of us are Birchers and the information that the Birch Society puts out is about as rock solid as you can get.
[00:50:38.363 --> 00:50:40.784]  Although they do make a few mistakes now and then.
[00:50:41.641 --> 00:50:41.821]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:04.987 --> 00:51:10.429]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:18.433]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.136 --> 00:51:26.199]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.579 --> 00:51:37.984]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.324 --> 00:51:42.266]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.286 --> 00:51:44.247]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.547 --> 00:51:48.389]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.026 --> 00:52:05.208]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:05.248 --> 00:52:09.271]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:09.411 --> 00:52:11.973]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:12.033 --> 00:52:14.374]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:14.555 --> 00:52:23.000]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:23.060 --> 00:52:24.381]  The brookie light is different.
[00:52:24.521 --> 00:52:28.524]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:28.524 --> 00:52:29.024]  We're good to go!
[00:52:49.053 --> 00:52:50.494]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:52:50.574 --> 00:52:55.098]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:52:55.138 --> 00:53:02.323]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:53:17.834 --> 00:53:25.438]  The package contains six DVDs that contain ten different programs, two books that combine to offer a thousand pages and other information.
[00:53:25.718 --> 00:53:28.860]  Order now at our website, mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:33.042]  That's mostholyfamilymonastery.com.
[00:53:33.302 --> 00:53:38.204]  The last word monastery is spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y, or call us at 1-800-275-1126.
[00:53:41.386 --> 00:53:44.227]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:53:44.367 --> 00:53:46.768]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:53:46.808 --> 00:53:48.388]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:53:48.408 --> 00:53:49.429]  It is a big idea!
[00:53:49.449 --> 00:53:50.089]  A new world order!
[00:54:09.958 --> 00:54:16.079]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:54:16.199 --> 00:54:17.980]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.301]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:25.962]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:54:26.822 --> 00:54:34.303]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:54:40.979 --> 00:54:46.084]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:54:47.125 --> 00:54:52.570]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:55.372]  The Americans are making great progress toward a world without them.
[00:54:55.512 --> 00:54:59.276]  And only an educated, informed public can stop them in their tracks.
[00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:01.678]  Alex, could you shut up, will you?
[00:55:02.258 --> 00:55:05.920]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:09.501]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[00:55:10.502 --> 00:55:14.804]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered a continent.
[00:55:14.844 --> 00:55:19.066]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[00:55:19.086 --> 00:55:26.549]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[00:55:32.146 --> 00:55:34.267]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[00:55:34.307 --> 00:55:37.007]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[00:55:37.267 --> 00:55:38.408]  Most people have no idea.
[00:55:38.428 --> 00:55:39.208]  They're not after money.
[00:55:39.228 --> 00:55:40.328]  They have all the money they need.
[00:55:40.528 --> 00:55:41.288]  They're after power.
[00:55:42.268 --> 00:55:43.169]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:46.810]  I was pulling up a plane.
[00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:48.630]  I knew they interrogated me for four hours.
[00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:49.590]  Some shots were fired.
[00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:50.971]  We need you to move off the process.
[00:55:51.971 --> 00:55:55.372]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:56:00.447 --> 00:56:00.927]  Endgame.
[00:56:01.247 --> 00:56:02.968]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:56:03.268 --> 00:56:04.489]  You have been warned.
[00:56:10.092 --> 00:56:11.793]  Alright, yeah, you have been warned.
[00:56:11.813 --> 00:56:12.893]  This is Bob Dacey.
[00:56:12.913 --> 00:56:17.795]  I'm back here on the last part of the first hour, last segment of the first hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:18.356 --> 00:56:22.618]  That was the trailer for Endgame and you gotta go to InfoWars.com.
[00:56:22.658 --> 00:56:27.400]  Get on your computer, go to InfoWars.com and pre-order Endgame.
[00:56:28.098 --> 00:56:36.322]  I know that this is going to be the best thing Alex ever put out, and that sounds like pretty scary stuff, but what he's talking about is well documented.
[00:56:36.442 --> 00:56:42.644]  I'm thinking about those stones in Atlanta somewhere.
[00:56:42.784 --> 00:56:53.409]  They've got a big monument they stuck up in the 80s, the guide stones or whatever, and they've got this nonsense on all these giant pillars of granite talking about how you got to one of the
[00:56:54.389 --> 00:57:04.891]  One of the guiding things we need to do as a global community is to keep the Earth's population at 500 million in harmony with nature.
[00:57:04.971 --> 00:57:06.432]  Well, guess what, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:57:06.832 --> 00:57:08.192]  That's the Georgia Guidestones.
[00:57:08.232 --> 00:57:09.852]  That's what that thing is called.
[00:57:10.252 --> 00:57:13.473]  And there you have this thing, and they put this thing up back in the 1980s.
[00:57:13.513 --> 00:57:15.293]  It cost a whole bunch of money to put that sucker up.
[00:57:15.714 --> 00:57:21.795]  And there you have it in many languages, how we can only have 500 million people in harmony with nature.
[00:57:21.815 --> 00:57:22.135]  That means
[00:57:22.475 --> 00:57:22.795]  I think so.
[00:57:47.231 --> 00:57:48.372]  And you gotta get it.
[00:57:48.912 --> 00:57:51.334]  It's very, very important.
[00:57:51.434 --> 00:57:54.757]  And while you're at it, you know, get a copy of Terror Storm.
[00:57:54.777 --> 00:57:56.558]  They got the new copy of Terror Storm out.
[00:57:56.618 --> 00:57:58.240]  It's got some new stuff in it.
[00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:01.923]  And, um, it's good stuff.
[00:58:02.063 --> 00:58:03.364]  I mean, it's accurate.
[00:58:04.164 --> 00:58:07.167]  Alex, you know, he gets, he's wild and crazy and he says a lot of stuff.
[00:58:07.967 --> 00:58:15.093]  And, but the fact of the matter is, especially when he's working those documentaries, man, you don't talk about solid, you don't talk about rock solid.
[00:58:15.953 --> 00:58:16.694]  Alex Jones.
[00:58:17.389 --> 00:58:27.179]  He is an information warrior par excellence, and every time I try to prove him wrong, I have a real hard time doing it.
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:32.304]  So, alright, that's it for the first hour today of this October the 12th, 2007.
[00:58:32.564 --> 00:58:39.291]  This is Bob Dacey, substituting for Alex Jones, and at the top of the hour, we're going to open up the phone line.
[00:58:42.265 --> 00:58:46.554]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-3333.
[00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:02.112]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.772 --> 00:59:03.592]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.333 --> 00:59:05.293]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.913 --> 00:59:09.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.095 --> 00:59:14.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.606 --> 00:59:27.832]  Okay, once again, this is Bob Dacey, the host of the Simple Truth TV Show here in Austin, Texas, substituting for Alex Jones on this 12th day of October 2007.
[00:59:29.574 --> 00:59:36.198]  Alex, again, he's taking a little well-deserved mini-vacation, and nobody deserves it more than he does.
[00:59:36.558 --> 00:59:44.263]  I have never been able to understand how that man works as hard as he does, non-stop, year after year after year after year.
[00:59:44.863 --> 00:59:46.444]  He is an inspiration.
[00:59:47.559 --> 00:59:50.440]  Uh, sometimes it's a little hard to get along with, but that's okay.
[00:59:50.881 --> 00:59:57.843]  You know, the guy is a modern day reincarnation of Patrick Henry and Paul Revere.
[00:59:58.784 --> 00:59:59.344]  That's what I think.
[01:00:00.405 --> 01:00:04.306]  So, anyway, Alex is not going to be here today or Monday or Tuesday.
[01:00:04.586 --> 01:00:08.188]  I, Bob Dacey, will be hosting the Simple Truth.
[01:00:08.328 --> 01:00:10.169]  I mean, not the Simple Truth, that's my TV show.
[01:00:10.209 --> 01:00:13.370]  We'll be hosting the Alex Jones Show for the next couple of days.
[01:00:14.208 --> 01:00:18.511]  And we're going to open up the phone lines here to talk about whatever you want to in a minute.
[01:00:18.691 --> 01:00:19.952]  The number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:19.992 --> 01:00:21.773]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:00:22.093 --> 01:00:34.981]  And what we're going to do, I think what I'm going to do today is kind of like one of those Rush Limbaugh things where you have like, what does he call it, Open Line Friday.
[01:00:35.301 --> 01:00:37.322]  Just call in and talk about whatever you want to talk about.
[01:00:37.342 --> 01:00:42.926]  You know, North American Union, Ron Paul, Al Gore, you know, whatever it is you want to talk about.
[01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:50.190]  You know, when I mention Rush Limbaugh, I have to comment about Rush Limbaugh.
[01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:53.051]  You know, he's on right now blathering about a bunch of nonsense.
[01:00:53.891 --> 01:00:56.893]  I used to listen to him and I was faked out by him back in the 80s.
[01:00:57.493 --> 01:01:06.817]  But Rush Limbaugh, although when he'll get on a particular topic, a specific topic, he'll be real good on the topic, you know, but the man is a consummate liar.
[01:01:07.597 --> 01:01:11.299]  And he does two major disservices, or two or three, I don't know.
[01:01:11.903 --> 01:01:13.564]  To Americans.
[01:01:13.785 --> 01:01:22.652]  One of them, he says that he's all the news you need, and he's the doctor of democracy, and he's the conservative guy, and all you need to do is listen to him.
[01:01:22.672 --> 01:01:24.053]  Well, that's a big fat lie, you know?
[01:01:25.274 --> 01:01:26.315]  That's not even close to true.
[01:01:26.335 --> 01:01:31.619]  The main thing he does, in terms of lying, is he lies by omission.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:39.205]  He will not get within a thousand feet of dozens of critical topics
[01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:43.492]  That are vital to the security of this country and our prosperity.
[01:01:43.932 --> 01:01:46.474]  Won't touch him with a 10 foot pole.
[01:01:47.234 --> 01:01:48.856]  Of course you know he's bought and paid for.
[01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:51.838]  You know he gets all this multi-million dollar this and multi-million dollar that.
[01:01:52.538 --> 01:01:57.142]  And if he did start talking about things that mattered, I think his Gregg betraying would come to an end.
[01:01:57.602 --> 01:02:01.865]  So main thing Rush Limbaugh does is he lies by omission.
[01:02:02.526 --> 01:02:08.150]  He won't talk about certain topics which are provable, vital,
[01:02:08.931 --> 01:02:17.034]  The other thing he does is he loves to make fun of quote-unquote liberals and to demean them and make them seem harmless and laughable.
[01:02:17.975 --> 01:02:23.677]  And you know, the modern-day liberal, even though he probably doesn't know it, is nothing but a sugar-coated totalitarian.
[01:02:24.517 --> 01:02:30.980]  Your modern-day so-called liberal, all he wants to do is empower the federal government to run your life even more than it runs it now.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:31.840]  You know?
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.443]  New program for this, new program for this, new federal this, new federal that, new federal mandate this, new federal regulation this,
[01:02:39.299 --> 01:02:50.328]  Uh, even though the government, the federal government screws up everything they touch, the modern-day liberal wants them to have more power so they can be free to screw up things even more than they screw them up now.
[01:02:50.868 --> 01:03:02.497]  And Limbaugh belittles liberals to make them seem harmless and laughable when, again, the modern-day liberal is nothing but somebody pushing totalitarianism.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:07.022]  You know, there's nothing liberal about the modern-day liberal.
[01:03:07.042 --> 01:03:13.565]  You want to talk about a liberal, that would be people like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson.
[01:03:13.585 --> 01:03:16.146]  Now those are some screaming liberals, those guys.
[01:03:16.546 --> 01:03:21.229]  For liberty, which is supposed to be the root of the word liberal.
[01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:21.989]  Liberty.
[01:03:22.469 --> 01:03:26.091]  Modern-day liberal has nothing to do with liberty.
[01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:30.073]  They want the government to run everything because they think government's good.
[01:03:30.814 --> 01:03:32.876]  Okay, when we get back from break we're going to take phone calls.
[01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:32.956]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:32.996 --> 01:03:34.918]  Bob Dacey on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:53.567 --> 01:03:58.529]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.

[01:04:08.953 --> 01:04:11.954]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.

[01:04:53.205 --> 01:04:54.627]  It is a big idea.
[01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:56.728]  A new world order.
[01:04:57.449 --> 01:05:01.712]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:05:02.341 --> 01:05:04.482]  It's known as the Bilderberg Theory.
[01:05:05.142 --> 01:05:07.343]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[01:05:07.943 --> 01:05:10.403]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:05:11.124 --> 01:05:18.426]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:05:21.474 --> 01:05:26.457]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:05:26.938 --> 01:05:30.400]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.302]  Bilderberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:05:33.362 --> 01:05:34.503]  Most people have no idea.
[01:05:34.523 --> 01:05:35.283]  They're not after money.
[01:05:35.303 --> 01:05:36.384]  They have all the money they need.
[01:05:36.584 --> 01:05:37.305]  They're after power.
[01:05:37.565 --> 01:05:38.365]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:43.269]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:05:50.233 --> 01:05:51.254]  You have been warned.
[01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:56.657]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:05:56.897 --> 01:06:01.800]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.341]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:06.843]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:21.071]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[01:06:53.965 --> 01:06:59.589]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.973 --> 01:07:10.979]  Okay, Bob Dacey back once again substituting for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show here on October the 12th, 2007.
[01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:19.040]  And we are putting the phone call, the phone numbers out to talk about pretty much whatever you want to.
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:24.303]  This is going to be a new experience for me, trying to be more spontaneous than I usually am.
[01:07:24.323 --> 01:07:29.346]  The number is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:29.386 --> 01:07:34.370]  And before we take our first call, I want to say that I use Calvin Pure Soap, actually.
[01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:36.511]  I use the bar soap and I use the shampoo.
[01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:38.032]  And I love the stuff.
[01:07:38.132 --> 01:07:38.852]  It's fantastic.
[01:07:38.872 --> 01:07:40.554]  I feel real good about it.
[01:07:40.674 --> 01:07:42.695]  And I don't have a whole lot of hair, but it cleans it real good.
[01:07:43.317 --> 01:07:44.860]  So, I just want to throw that in there.
[01:07:45.421 --> 01:07:49.267]  Okay, we've got Steve from Pennsylvania on the line.
[01:07:49.327 --> 01:07:49.968]  Steve, are you there?
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.681]  Hi, Mr. Basie.
[01:07:52.941 --> 01:07:55.303]  Mr. Basie, that's D as in David, A-C-Y.
[01:07:55.323 --> 01:07:56.544]  There's no Basies around here.
[01:07:56.564 --> 01:07:57.484]  That's Count Basie.
[01:07:57.524 --> 01:07:57.925]  That ain't me.
[01:07:57.945 --> 01:07:59.486]  Okay, I stand corrected.
[01:07:59.526 --> 01:08:04.790]  You're my favorite fill-in when Alex is under the weather, and I always appreciate hearing you.
[01:08:04.850 --> 01:08:06.411]  You're a very good speaker.
[01:08:06.771 --> 01:08:09.733]  Well, you see, here's my big claim to fame.
[01:08:10.314 --> 01:08:15.958]  Back in 1977, I got a degree in radio, television, film production from the University of Texas.
[01:08:16.952 --> 01:08:22.313]  And see, my big claim to fame is that I'm not afraid of a TV camera or a microphone.
[01:08:22.853 --> 01:08:23.913]  That's what it is, right there.
[01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:24.733]  That's the whole secret.
[01:08:25.994 --> 01:08:27.354]  I'm a ham radio operator.
[01:08:27.414 --> 01:08:28.714]  Did you ever get your ham license?
[01:08:28.974 --> 01:08:30.815]  No, no, no.
[01:08:31.335 --> 01:08:32.715]  I'm currently a technophobe.
[01:08:33.055 --> 01:08:34.555]  I've fallen way down, you know.
[01:08:35.095 --> 01:08:41.516]  But I spend most of my time either running my hardware store or on the internet doing research from a TV show.
[01:08:41.857 --> 01:08:44.357]  And of course, I do have this local TV show called Simple Truth.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.163]  I've been doing that for almost, you know, we're in our ninth season.
[01:08:48.203 --> 01:08:52.366]  So basically, my big claim to fame is you point the TV camera at me, I don't freeze up.
[01:08:52.426 --> 01:08:54.988]  So that's, that's, that's, and this microphone.
[01:08:55.249 --> 01:08:57.691]  There's probably a couple of million people listening to us right now.
[01:08:58.331 --> 01:09:00.473]  Okay, I'd like to... It doesn't bother me.
[01:09:01.474 --> 01:09:02.134]  Oh, great.
[01:09:02.294 --> 01:09:07.599]  I'd like to, Mr. Dacey, I'd like to, you know, we talk on the 75 meter band every night.
[01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.221]  We basically have a Bible study.
[01:09:10.928 --> 01:09:13.029]  And we also talk about the New World Order.
[01:09:13.089 --> 01:09:17.190]  The Alex Jones program comes up almost three or four times a week.
[01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:18.830]  Could I get the frequency out?
[01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:25.011]  So in case your listeners would care to listen to or that have ham radio operators that would like to join us, they could.
[01:09:25.031 --> 01:09:26.152]  Is this a shortwave deal?
[01:09:26.732 --> 01:09:27.012]  Yes.
[01:09:27.372 --> 01:09:27.932]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:09:28.252 --> 01:09:29.812]  So I'm a 75 meter band.
[01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:33.713]  We're on the lower side band every evening from 11 p.m.
[01:09:33.833 --> 01:09:34.794]  to 2 a.m.
[01:09:34.914 --> 01:09:36.114]  Eastern Standard Time.
[01:09:36.570 --> 01:09:44.917]  We're on 3.944, so if you have a shortwave, I know Alex sells a Cato shortwave that can decode sideband.
[01:09:45.338 --> 01:09:47.379]  We're at 3.944.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:57.648]  It's a pretty loosely knit Bible study group that talks in depth about the New World Order, and we do support Alex the whole way.
[01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:08.100]  What's this I heard about some road up there, number 80, that they're planning on slapping some tolls on up there.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:08.821]  You know anything about that?
[01:10:09.061 --> 01:10:10.701]  Oh, we're fighting them left and right here.
[01:10:10.981 --> 01:10:22.326]  What they're doing is, first off, they're saying they want to sell the turnpike to the foreigners, and then if we don't agree to sell the turnpike to the foreigners, then they're going to put tolls on Route 80.
[01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:36.987]  But we have a real big contingence of people up here that are saying, look, there's so many corporations that get fed through Interstate 80, they said, look, if you toll Interstate 80, we're leaving.
[01:10:37.008 --> 01:10:38.329]  We're out of Pennsylvania.
[01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:41.274]  We have a pretty high tax state here already.
[01:10:41.812 --> 01:10:46.216]  So it looks like they won't poll 80, but that means they're going to sell the turnpike.
[01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:51.060]  Any way that people lose, I ask everybody in America to stand up against this.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.822]  This is just a new world order.
[01:10:53.902 --> 01:10:55.243]  They're going to use it against us.
[01:10:55.764 --> 01:11:01.188]  Nobody can run that turnpike cheaper than the good people we have down there running it now.
[01:11:01.288 --> 01:11:06.933]  If you think it's going to be any cheaper to run on that turnpike, selling it to a foreign investor,
[01:11:07.768 --> 01:11:09.228]  You know, you need your head examined.
[01:11:09.448 --> 01:11:11.889]  Do you know who the foreign investor is?
[01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:19.131]  Well, he talked about a French company, then he talked about a Swedish company, now I guess China's the big bidder.
[01:11:19.471 --> 01:11:20.531]  So there's a bunch of them.
[01:11:20.631 --> 01:11:21.511]  I'm confused about it.
[01:11:21.531 --> 01:11:28.593]  I saw that story yesterday on my computer and I'm going, wait, I don't understand this because I-80, that's Interstate 80, right?
[01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:29.888]  That's a big one.
[01:11:30.968 --> 01:11:33.070]  I think I can go all the way to Colorado on 80.
[01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:42.036]  The way I've understood this for years, it's not legal to toll an interstate highway because it was built with federal funds.
[01:11:42.076 --> 01:11:43.657]  So how are they trying to get away with that up there?
[01:11:44.893 --> 01:11:55.379]  No, I'm not the governor, but he got legalized gambling up all throughout the state here, and if he can do that, he can probably make money on the turnpike too, or on interstate 80 also.
[01:11:55.519 --> 01:12:05.824]  You people in Pennsylvania need to get on this, because federal law, with very few limitations, is that you cannot toll
[01:12:06.915 --> 01:12:07.636]  I think so.
[01:12:24.571 --> 01:12:27.893]  Well, again, Mr. Dacey, like I'm saying, they're playing the left hand against the right, saying, look, we want to sell the turnpike.
[01:12:27.913 --> 01:12:28.254]  We're saying no.
[01:12:28.274 --> 01:12:29.534]  They're saying, okay, then we're going to
[01:12:54.611 --> 01:12:59.572]  Yeah, but it sounds to me like in a poker game they don't have a hand.
[01:13:01.413 --> 01:13:02.553]  They can't tax 80.
[01:13:03.113 --> 01:13:04.694]  They can't slap toll roads on 80.
[01:13:05.054 --> 01:13:05.814]  It's not legal.
[01:13:06.314 --> 01:13:06.995]  I hope you're right.
[01:13:07.295 --> 01:13:14.357]  I mean, right now the businesses are fighting and it looks like we won on the interstate 80, but it looks like then we're going to lose on the turnpike.
[01:13:14.457 --> 01:13:15.317]  So, I don't know.
[01:13:15.517 --> 01:13:19.878]  Well, y'all need to, up in Pennsylvania, y'all need to fight them tooth and nail on this.
[01:13:19.958 --> 01:13:22.499]  I'll guarantee you, because whatever they're doing, it's crooked.
[01:13:23.294 --> 01:13:24.554]  Thank you, Mr. All right.
[01:13:24.755 --> 01:13:25.635]  I appreciate the call.
[01:13:25.655 --> 01:13:26.815]  That was Steve from Pennsylvania.
[01:13:27.195 --> 01:13:28.476]  Yeah, that's a that.
[01:13:28.596 --> 01:13:37.119]  I must admit, I saw this story yesterday and I'm going, how in the world can they toll an interstate highway in Pennsylvania when it's not legal to do it?
[01:13:37.619 --> 01:13:38.459]  I'm confused.
[01:13:38.939 --> 01:13:45.261]  So if anybody knows about that, you know, hey, send something to Trey at Infowars.com.
[01:13:45.281 --> 01:13:52.684]  Maybe we can clear this up, because if they're threatening to toll interstate, that's a hollow threat because the law is not in place.
[01:13:53.405 --> 01:14:06.221]  I mean, safety loo, the law that they passed in 2005, when nobody was looking, that set up pilot programs to start tolling interstate stuff, like bridges and tunnels and whatnot.
[01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:07.923]  But it was limited.
[01:14:07.963 --> 01:14:09.004]  It was a pilot thing.
[01:14:09.597 --> 01:14:13.638]  But here they're talking about totaling an entire interstate in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:13.658 --> 01:14:16.939]  There's something rotten in Pennsylvania right there.
[01:14:17.399 --> 01:14:18.960]  So somebody needs to look into that.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:20.560]  Here we are on air.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.241]  I can't look into it, but we need to look into that because there's something wrong there.
[01:14:24.761 --> 01:14:30.383]  I think they're trying to pull a fast one on the people of Pennsylvania by threatening them with something that is illegal.
[01:14:30.423 --> 01:14:31.283]  They can't even do it.
[01:14:32.023 --> 01:14:33.583]  So anyway, that was Steve from Pennsylvania.
[01:14:33.603 --> 01:14:38.445]  We got Daryl in Virginia up next, followed by Dean in Canada and Tom in Wisconsin.
[01:14:38.465 --> 01:14:39.365]  Daryl, are you still there?
[01:14:40.094 --> 01:14:40.374]  I am.
[01:14:40.434 --> 01:14:41.075]  How are you today?
[01:14:41.175 --> 01:14:41.956]  I'm doing all right.
[01:14:41.996 --> 01:14:42.796]  What's up with you, man?
[01:14:43.697 --> 01:14:47.060]  I just wanted to let you know I really appreciate your commentary.
[01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:58.769]  And I remember listening to the show a couple of weeks ago, where as you were discussing a letter about the North American Union, the headpiece that they wrote out against Corsi and you guys.
[01:14:58.890 --> 01:15:00.551]  I think you did a great job with that.
[01:15:01.252 --> 01:15:08.114]  Oh, you're talking about the one with Christopher Hayes from the Nation magazine?
[01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:11.135]  Yes.
[01:15:11.635 --> 01:15:14.736]  I've got to laugh at this guy.
[01:15:15.236 --> 01:15:21.158]  I met him in Austin several months ago when he came down and he interviewed Kelly Taylor and I kind of tagged along.
[01:15:22.697 --> 01:15:26.779]  The guy, you know, he's a young guy, you know, he's very intellectual.
[01:15:27.079 --> 01:15:31.881]  He can multitask like nobody's business with his computer and types like a whirlwind.
[01:15:31.921 --> 01:15:38.364]  And, you know, the problem with the guy is he was educated at Brown, so he's educated as a globalist.
[01:15:38.404 --> 01:15:40.645]  He thinks the New World Order is a great thing, I guess.
[01:15:41.766 --> 01:15:50.550]  And he came up with this ridiculous article in The Nation magazine which claimed that the Trans-Texas Corridor was very real.
[01:15:52.091 --> 01:15:56.558]  But that the NAFTA superhighway was something we tinfoil hat wearing kooks made up.
[01:15:57.768 --> 01:16:14.737]  And the whole thing was so preposterous that the Trans-Texas Corridor, a four-football field-wide thing with rail and separate truck and car lanes and other communications, was going to stop at the border with Oklahoma and just turn into a two-lane dirt road.
[01:16:15.298 --> 01:16:19.760]  And same thing in Mexico, stop at the Rio Grande River and turn into a two-lane dirt road.
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:23.302]  It was so preposterous that even his own readership
[01:16:23.957 --> 01:16:32.761]  I did see some of the blog posts in response to his article and I do remember seeing some of the readership revolting against him, that's for sure.
[01:16:52.248 --> 01:16:53.449]  I didn't see the C-SPAN.
[01:16:53.870 --> 01:17:16.811]  He was on C-SPAN on a show called Washington Journal and he was taking phone calls based on his ridiculous article about NAFTA Superhighway being a myth and he was getting clobbered one after another after another by these people calling into that program and at the end of the program the moderator let him sum it up
[01:17:17.854 --> 01:17:38.662]  And that's when Mr. Hayes exposed his education when he said that the reason people are concerned about this mythical map to Superhighway and reading too much into things like the Trans-Texas Corridor is because they're concerned about the lack of dialogue on post-national America.
[01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:40.402]  Amazing.
[01:17:41.003 --> 01:17:44.464]  Now, post-national America, look it up.
[01:17:44.904 --> 01:17:46.905]  That's not post-toasties we're talking about here.
[01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:49.191]  Post means after.
[01:17:50.492 --> 01:17:50.992]  Absolutely.
[01:17:51.132 --> 01:17:51.813]  That's amazing.
[01:17:51.833 --> 01:17:53.194]  I have two other quick points.
[01:17:53.254 --> 01:17:54.735]  I know you have other callers.
[01:17:54.955 --> 01:17:56.696]  Sure.
[01:17:56.856 --> 01:18:15.069]  The other day I was watching Larry King Live and Vicente Fox was on there and I pulled the transcripts where he was discussing or Vicente Fox had stated the intention of the North American Union and more bluntly the currency of the emiro.
[01:18:16.861 --> 01:18:22.322]  And I have some friends of mine who actually are Mexican and I took the transcript to their attention.
[01:18:22.342 --> 01:18:27.023]  I will tell you, Nationalist Mexicans were extremely upset about it.
[01:18:27.283 --> 01:18:29.223]  Yeah, there's a good reason for that.
[01:18:29.423 --> 01:18:32.304]  Darryl, let me hold you over through the break.
[01:18:32.344 --> 01:18:40.586]  If you can wait about four minutes because we've got a four minute break coming up and we'll be back with Darryl from Virginia after this time out.
[01:18:40.766 --> 01:18:42.206]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.

[01:19:40.474 --> 01:19:43.135]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:19:48.778 --> 01:19:55.522]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:55.902 --> 01:20:05.888]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[01:20:06.369 --> 01:20:11.912]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[01:20:11.972 --> 01:20:14.754]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July.
[01:20:15.606 --> 01:20:18.629]  With falls of 32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[01:20:19.129 --> 01:20:21.171]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[01:20:22.091 --> 01:20:25.054]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency.
[01:20:25.274 --> 01:20:27.276]  And the quality of the dollar is poor.
[01:20:27.476 --> 01:20:29.217]  Because the quantity is so high.
[01:20:29.598 --> 01:20:32.420]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results.
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:35.382]  Victimizing middle class citizens and discouraging savings.
[01:20:35.943 --> 01:20:40.426]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[01:20:40.827 --> 01:20:43.409]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:45.474]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.

[01:21:50.418 --> 01:21:51.727]  Yeah.
[01:21:53.098 --> 01:21:53.578]  Hi, Ken.
[01:21:53.618 --> 01:21:54.398]  It's Judy again.
[01:21:54.418 --> 01:21:58.940]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:02.241]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:22:02.461 --> 01:22:04.341]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:22:04.601 --> 01:22:06.682]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:22:06.862 --> 01:22:12.984]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:22:13.164 --> 01:22:18.466]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:22:18.726 --> 01:22:21.587]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:22:21.707 --> 01:22:22.627]  Go KenSolar!
[01:22:23.934 --> 01:22:25.475]  Get the best of both worlds.
[01:22:25.875 --> 01:22:30.999]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all in one.

[01:22:53.348 --> 01:23:01.954]  Yes, I was just mentioning the issue with the Mexicans understanding that their country is under threat just like our nation is.
[01:23:21.365 --> 01:23:21.825]  What's going on here?
[01:23:41.574 --> 01:23:43.335]  Well, you know, that's a good thing.
[01:23:43.495 --> 01:23:55.203]  I mean, you know, we need to wake up to Mexicans, even though what they think in general doesn't matter to the Rockefeller-controlled, globalist, elitist that run their whole country.
[01:23:55.903 --> 01:23:57.764]  You know, Chase Manhattan runs the whole place.
[01:23:58.224 --> 01:24:02.987]  But, you know, Mexico as a nation is the crookedest country in the Western Hemisphere.
[01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:07.570]  You know, wave 50 bucks around, you can get whatever you want, any government official you want.
[01:24:07.690 --> 01:24:08.731]  It's the crookedest country
[01:24:09.418 --> 01:24:11.139]  In the Western Hemisphere, it's a narco state.
[01:24:11.420 --> 01:24:21.328]  However, having said that, the Mexican people, even though they're under the thumb of the crookedest group of people in the Western Hemisphere, are wonderful people.
[01:24:22.108 --> 01:24:22.348]  You know?
[01:24:22.408 --> 01:24:22.989]  Absolutely.
[01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:31.396]  They just, they didn't, they weren't raised in a culture of freedom and individual liberty.
[01:24:32.036 --> 01:24:36.860]  And that's a shame, but the Mexican people are wonderful people.
[01:24:37.521 --> 01:24:42.363]  It's just that they're under the grips, and have been for hundreds of years, of a bunch of crooks.
[01:24:43.023 --> 01:24:45.203]  And now, you know, it's narco crooks.
[01:24:46.224 --> 01:24:47.204]  You know, that's just a shame.
[01:24:48.064 --> 01:24:59.908]  Well, I think one of the ways we can expose it is not just keeping it to ourselves, but also waking up as many Mexican people, because they're completely nationalistic, as we are, or as we once were.
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:01.280]  That's for sure.
[01:25:01.400 --> 01:25:02.501]  You know what I think we ought to do?
[01:25:02.541 --> 01:25:10.464]  I think we ought to print up a bunch of United States Constitutions and Bills of Rights in Spanish and leaflet the whole country with them.
[01:25:10.804 --> 01:25:11.805]  Say, here's a rule book.
[01:25:12.265 --> 01:25:12.645]  Follow it.
[01:25:14.486 --> 01:25:16.247]  Well, that's a good idea, too.
[01:25:16.267 --> 01:25:22.129]  The last point I wanted to make is, have you seen the Ron Paul article that's on WorldNetDaily?
[01:25:22.430 --> 01:25:23.050]  Which one?
[01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:25.591]  Ron Paul is all over the place, man.
[01:25:25.671 --> 01:25:28.832]  Well, it's a new one that came out early this morning.
[01:25:29.052 --> 01:25:30.133]  It's from Mercer.
[01:25:31.016 --> 01:25:49.586]  It's called Ron Paul's Electability, and it goes into a complete analysis of the contrast between Mike Huckabee in general and the rest of the playing field, and why Ron would make a better choice than the other candidates, mainly because of the anti-war stance.
[01:25:49.966 --> 01:25:50.446]  Absolutely.
[01:25:50.466 --> 01:25:51.767]  I mean, you can do the math on that one.
[01:25:52.007 --> 01:25:53.868]  I mean, I haven't read the article, but I can do math.
[01:25:54.891 --> 01:25:58.532]  Over 70% of the American people are against this stupid war we were lied into.
[01:25:58.552 --> 01:26:01.692]  I mean, we weren't mistaked into it, we were lied into it.
[01:26:02.892 --> 01:26:09.134]  You got 4,000, almost 4,000 American servicemen and women dead over there so that Dick Cheney can get rich?
[01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:10.134]  You know?
[01:26:11.174 --> 01:26:11.554]  Whoa!
[01:26:12.474 --> 01:26:14.374]  That's got to be some obscene amount of crime.
[01:26:14.594 --> 01:26:23.156]  So you got over 70% of the American people that are against this stupid war and you've got 25% and falling of people that claim to be Republicans
[01:26:24.409 --> 01:26:29.391]  And you've got a big group of them that's not going to vote for Giuliani no matter what.
[01:26:30.311 --> 01:26:31.072]  Do the math!
[01:26:31.192 --> 01:26:34.293]  You can't get a Republican elected president unless it's Ron Paul.
[01:26:35.153 --> 01:26:35.953]  Well, I agree.
[01:26:36.033 --> 01:26:41.836]  And I would just ask that your webmaster Google that and maybe post it up on your site.
[01:26:42.616 --> 01:26:46.117]  The title of it is called Ron Paul's Electability at WorldNetDaily.
[01:26:46.657 --> 01:26:48.378]  And the writer, her last name is Mercer.
[01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:49.078]  It's excellent.
[01:26:49.118 --> 01:26:50.659]  Is that Eliana Mercer?
[01:26:51.559 --> 01:26:53.581]  Her last name is Mercer, M-E-R-C-E-R.
[01:26:53.801 --> 01:26:55.882]  Yeah, Eliana Mercer, is that her first name?
[01:26:56.102 --> 01:26:56.983]  Yeah.
[01:26:57.363 --> 01:27:00.365]  Yeah, well, yeah, maybe they'll put it up, maybe they'll post it.
[01:27:00.406 --> 01:27:00.686]  I don't know.
[01:27:00.986 --> 01:27:04.649]  I'm just the hired helper on here today, so I don't have any authority and power over here.
[01:27:04.689 --> 01:27:09.932]  But if any of you guys are listening, maybe you want to, might want to go to WorldNet Daily and post that article about Ron Paul's electability.
[01:27:10.353 --> 01:27:12.995]  You know, it's funny talking about Ron Paul's electability.
[01:27:13.495 --> 01:27:18.639]  The guy, you know, he rules the Internet, and he rules all the polls.
[01:27:19.594 --> 01:27:32.987]  And I was talking about that thing last week on my show where this Pajamas Media organization has been putting up this poll every week about who you think is your guy for the Republican nomination.
[01:27:33.408 --> 01:27:38.392]  And Ron Paul has been winning the thing by margins of 60 to 65 percent or whatever every single week.
[01:27:39.153 --> 01:27:41.215]  So I went to it again and he was gone.
[01:27:42.276 --> 01:27:42.817]  Just gone!
[01:27:43.277 --> 01:27:44.078]  Wasn't there anymore!
[01:27:44.984 --> 01:27:53.549]  And the people that ran it claimed that, well, you know, he was winning it all the time, and these are internet spammers, and we needed to, we needed to, to, they just took him out!
[01:27:53.589 --> 01:27:54.689]  They just took him off the poll!
[01:27:54.989 --> 01:27:58.391]  You know, it's funny, it's like, what a joke it was.
[01:27:58.411 --> 01:28:02.373]  As a matter of fact, they were using a Fox News poll as justification for pulling him off.
[01:28:02.433 --> 01:28:05.775]  They said, well, look, this poll says that these guys are in the lead.
[01:28:06.175 --> 01:28:09.657]  But you go to that poll that they're referring to, and they don't give Ron Pauls a choice!
[01:28:10.603 --> 01:28:10.843]  Right.
[01:28:10.963 --> 01:28:11.964]  It's such a scam.
[01:28:13.205 --> 01:28:22.352]  Newsmax did the same thing on their polls but I noticed the most recent one they actually have Ron Paul and the other candidates on there to equal it out.
[01:28:22.792 --> 01:28:23.513]  Well that's good.
[01:28:23.533 --> 01:28:25.714]  Darrell I appreciate you very much for the call.
[01:28:25.774 --> 01:28:27.776]  It was a good call and you hang in there buddy.
[01:28:28.657 --> 01:28:32.740]  And after the break we're going to be back with Tom and Ken and Pam.
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:34.581]  Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[01:28:43.544 --> 01:28:46.549]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:50.154]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:55.671]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:28:56.051 --> 01:28:59.111]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:28:59.351 --> 01:29:03.933]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:29:04.313 --> 01:29:06.913]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:29:07.453 --> 01:29:14.135]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:29:14.595 --> 01:29:19.839]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:29:20.279 --> 01:29:21.920]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:29:22.441 --> 01:29:25.723]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:29:26.303 --> 01:29:29.646]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:29:29.686 --> 01:29:36.330]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:29:37.031 --> 01:29:41.834]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and
[01:29:41.854 --> 01:29:42.435]  And shipping!
[01:29:42.735 --> 01:29:45.638]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[01:29:45.898 --> 01:29:46.299]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:29:46.319 --> 01:29:46.679]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[01:29:53.246 --> 01:30:01.311]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentz, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:30:01.792 --> 01:30:11.058]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:30:11.558 --> 01:30:15.861]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:28.525]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery and arthritis.
[01:30:29.045 --> 01:30:33.947]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:30:34.447 --> 01:30:36.948]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound.
[01:30:37.028 --> 01:30:37.788]  And the best part?
[01:30:38.289 --> 01:30:39.769]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:30:39.849 --> 01:30:41.550]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:30:41.690 --> 01:30:44.211]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:30:44.691 --> 01:30:45.071]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:30:45.091 --> 01:30:45.952]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:30:53.579 --> 01:30:54.240]  It's a fact.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:31:01.986]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:31:02.086 --> 01:31:10.612]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:31:10.873 --> 01:31:21.521]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:31:21.761 --> 01:31:27.885]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:31:28.085 --> 01:31:33.169]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:31:33.329 --> 01:31:37.872]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:31:38.032 --> 01:31:39.853]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:31:39.893 --> 01:31:40.173]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:31:40.193 --> 01:31:40.594]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:31:40.714 --> 01:31:42.535]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:56.423]  Yeah, there's a war on for your country's national sovereignty, too.
[01:31:56.443 --> 01:31:59.504]  Once again, this is Bob Dicey substituting for Alex Jones.
[01:32:12.353 --> 01:32:21.838]  One of the previous callers had mentioned Vicente Fox on the Daily Show, talking with Jon Stewart, and we just happened to have that clip for you.
[01:32:26.785 --> 01:32:33.867]  Uh, and you know, he's been very open in his statements to the Mexican press about how we need to have a North American Union and merge our countries.
[01:32:34.147 --> 01:32:42.830]  But anyway, this was a clip from a few days ago, uh, on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart, the former president of Mexico, Vicente Fox.
[01:32:44.411 --> 01:32:49.092]  ...ride all the way down to Guanajuato and looking for his American dream.
[01:32:49.252 --> 01:32:52.753]  Without a penny in his pocket, he made his dream in Mexico.
[01:32:53.393 --> 01:32:55.654]  So migration is a two-way street.
[01:32:56.531 --> 01:32:57.592]  Can I tell you this?
[01:32:58.132 --> 01:33:04.618]  Cincinnati has gone hugely downhill since then.
[01:33:04.678 --> 01:33:07.400]  If I were you, I'd saddle up and come back.
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.160]  Help us!
[01:33:08.341 --> 01:33:08.781]  Help us!
[01:33:10.723 --> 01:33:17.748]  Do you feel that because of September 11th, we're overreacting to the border situation there?
[01:33:18.209 --> 01:33:24.794]  Yeah, it's my impression that fear is guiding public opinion here, and xenophobic
[01:33:26.596 --> 01:33:33.258]  I think that we can come up with a very wise, very wisdom solution and reform to immigration because it's a win-win situation.
[01:33:33.298 --> 01:33:34.718]  You don't want defense.
[01:33:34.778 --> 01:33:35.419]  What if we build
[01:33:53.422 --> 01:33:56.207]  The fence, and have the nice part facing Mexico.
[01:33:56.347 --> 01:33:56.888]  The pretty part.
[01:33:58.534 --> 01:34:07.917]  Why did we build a fence and not let in products that come from the States to Mexico worth over 200 billion US dollars?
[01:34:08.337 --> 01:34:11.378]  Worth many, many jobs to this nation right here.
[01:34:11.618 --> 01:34:13.399]  So you're saying it's too extreme, the globalization.
[01:34:13.639 --> 01:34:14.579]  You're for NAFTA then?
[01:34:15.019 --> 01:34:16.820]  Has NAFTA helped Mexico?
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:17.640]  Absolutely, yes.
[01:34:17.740 --> 01:34:22.041]  Seven largest trade balance, larger than all of Latin America together.
[01:34:22.741 --> 01:34:25.062]  And yes, NAFTA has been good.
[01:34:25.162 --> 01:34:28.003]  As a matter of fact, we should have a new vision, go further.
[01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:32.033]  Integrating and working together to build a better future for both.
[01:34:32.113 --> 01:34:38.517]  How high, if the standard of living in Mexico, because people still come over because they can get better jobs and things.
[01:34:38.918 --> 01:34:39.758]  How long would it take?
[01:34:39.798 --> 01:34:46.663]  How high would the standard have to go before you think the tide starts to settle and shifts?
[01:34:46.763 --> 01:34:50.406]  We're at 8,000 right now, 8,000 US dollars per capita a year.
[01:34:50.907 --> 01:34:53.609]  I think it should go all the way up to over 20.
[01:34:53.829 --> 01:34:56.831]  And that happened with Spain, with the European Union.
[01:34:57.518 --> 01:34:58.739]  We're good to go.
[01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:23.959]  A little bit of a human attitude of working together as a team.
[01:35:24.019 --> 01:35:25.321]  Would you like to see a North American?
[01:35:26.102 --> 01:35:26.742]  So what's your team?
[01:35:26.843 --> 01:35:28.404]  You'd go with Mexico?
[01:35:28.545 --> 01:35:28.805]  Yes.
[01:35:29.065 --> 01:35:29.766]  US?
[01:35:30.127 --> 01:35:30.527]  Canada?
[01:35:30.567 --> 01:35:31.288]  You want Canada in there?
[01:35:34.691 --> 01:35:35.991]  Why doesn't South America do that?
[01:35:36.071 --> 01:35:40.253]  Why doesn't South America have some sort of South American Union like the EU?
[01:35:40.553 --> 01:35:41.893]  There's different blocks.
[01:35:41.913 --> 01:35:45.454]  There's one in Central America, all nations there join together.
[01:35:45.794 --> 01:35:49.716]  There's one in the South in Mercosur.
[01:35:49.896 --> 01:35:53.697]  Are you aware of like Evo Morales and Hugo Chavez and those guys?
[01:35:53.997 --> 01:35:55.278]  We had Evo on the show.
[01:35:55.758 --> 01:35:57.278]  He seemed very nice.
[01:35:57.779 --> 01:35:59.759]  He just talked a little bit about redistributing.
[01:35:59.999 --> 01:36:00.259]  Terrible.
[01:36:00.319 --> 01:36:00.740]  Terrible.
[01:36:03.456 --> 01:36:06.998]  Populism, demagoguery... Even Morales.
[01:36:07.038 --> 01:36:08.579]  I know Chavez, but Morales as well.
[01:36:09.119 --> 01:36:11.080]  Yeah, both of them in Correa and Ecuador.
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:12.360]  He was a fair guy.
[01:36:12.561 --> 01:36:13.641]  Now he had an interpreter.
[01:36:13.681 --> 01:36:15.882]  Do you think he speaks English?
[01:36:16.723 --> 01:36:18.704]  No, he speaks his dialect.
[01:36:18.884 --> 01:36:19.284]  Oh, it is?
[01:36:19.424 --> 01:36:19.624]  Okay.
[01:36:19.644 --> 01:36:20.765]  Because he's indigenous.
[01:36:21.485 --> 01:36:31.390]  But it's a pity for Bolivians, for Venezuelans, not being taught to fish, but just giving the fish out.
[01:36:32.226 --> 01:36:36.988]  They're not constructing a solid economy, or industry, or jobs.
[01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:43.530]  It's just giving away the money that is not theirs to stay in power through corruption.
[01:36:43.690 --> 01:36:48.972]  I just don't believe that's the way to go to reduce poverty and distribute income.
[01:36:49.272 --> 01:36:49.532]  Wow.
[01:36:49.672 --> 01:36:52.353]  You know, now I'm going to have to ask him back, because I didn't say any of that stuff.
[01:36:53.833 --> 01:36:55.374]  What he was talking about made perfect sense.
[01:36:55.594 --> 01:36:56.774]  Now you make perfect sense.
[01:36:57.255 --> 01:36:58.375]  I hate this politics thing.
[01:37:00.009 --> 01:37:00.870]  It's a fascinating book.
[01:37:01.010 --> 01:37:03.291]  It's got great insights into all the different world leaders.
[01:37:03.431 --> 01:37:05.052]  And I thank you greatly for coming by on the show.
[01:37:05.192 --> 01:37:06.673]  And I really appreciate it.
[01:37:06.853 --> 01:37:07.433]  Thank you, John.
[01:37:07.473 --> 01:37:11.755]  By the way, you have a heritage of migration in your past.
[01:37:11.935 --> 01:37:12.135]  Yes.
[01:37:12.175 --> 01:37:13.756]  You came from... Me?
[01:37:13.896 --> 01:37:15.077]  Maybe the Basque.
[01:37:15.937 --> 01:37:16.277]  Me?
[01:37:16.357 --> 01:37:18.218]  John Jones, a Basque man.
[01:37:18.398 --> 01:37:19.699]  Oh, I got... Big Jew.
[01:37:19.919 --> 01:37:20.279]  Big Jew.
[01:37:24.804 --> 01:37:33.539]  Gee whiz, that Vicente Fox, man, he must be one of the founders of that website www.crockastuff.com.
[01:37:34.541 --> 01:37:36.404]  That guy is amazing!
[01:37:37.225 --> 01:37:45.011]  Spewing lie after lie after lie, smiling all the time, winning over those idiots in the audience.
[01:37:45.991 --> 01:37:49.474]  Yeah, yeah, it's a two-way street and immigration is a two-way street.
[01:37:49.554 --> 01:37:50.735]  Try to get into Mexico.
[01:37:50.755 --> 01:37:52.596]  Why would you want to?
[01:37:52.896 --> 01:37:54.698]  Try to have any rights if you go into Mexico.
[01:37:55.118 --> 01:37:55.758]  Forget it.
[01:37:56.239 --> 01:38:03.344]  The guy, you know, Kirk Watson, our state senator, who is such a silver-tongued devil, could take lessons from this guy ever since they fought.
[01:38:04.244 --> 01:38:13.031]  I can't even begin to describe the crock that that guy was spreading out all over the place there on the Daily Show.
[01:38:13.091 --> 01:38:21.939]  However, he did, while he was telling you how wonderful it all is going to be, talk about a nice North American Union with Canada and Mexico.
[01:38:22.039 --> 01:38:25.562]  So, hey, it's not that we're making this stuff up.
[01:38:25.822 --> 01:38:27.523]  The evidence of it is legion.
[01:38:27.884 --> 01:38:30.926]  OK, we're going to go now to Tom in Wisconsin.
[01:38:30.946 --> 01:38:32.147]  He's been holding for a little while.
[01:38:32.187 --> 01:38:33.028]  Tom, are you still there?
[01:38:36.533 --> 01:38:37.593]  Yeah, I'm here.
[01:38:38.073 --> 01:38:42.816]  Yeah, I wanted to know about these chemtrails.
[01:38:42.836 --> 01:38:48.219]  I wonder why it seems to me that nobody is aware of this thing that's going on.
[01:38:49.130 --> 01:38:50.350]  Well, I think they're aware of them.
[01:38:50.710 --> 01:38:54.271]  There's a lot of information out on Kim Trails.
[01:38:54.291 --> 01:38:58.193]  There's a lot of disinformation out on Kim Trails.
[01:38:58.673 --> 01:39:02.014]  I've studied them years ago, and yeah, they exist because you can see them.
[01:39:02.154 --> 01:39:03.874]  I remember seeing some.
[01:39:03.914 --> 01:39:05.094]  Yeah, Sunday I saw them.
[01:39:05.114 --> 01:39:06.435]  They were all over the sky.
[01:39:06.495 --> 01:39:08.935]  I mean, the whole sky is full of that stuff.
[01:39:08.955 --> 01:39:10.756]  You don't even get normal clouds anymore.
[01:39:11.016 --> 01:39:12.897]  Yeah, well, I mean... I mean, my blood boil.
[01:39:12.977 --> 01:39:14.898]  I mean, I get ticked every time I see that.
[01:39:15.078 --> 01:39:20.760]  Well, several days in Austin, where I'm from, I've seen literal tic-tac-toe patterns covering the whole city.
[01:39:20.960 --> 01:39:24.202]  That's been a long time since I've seen that was really that expensively.
[01:39:24.422 --> 01:39:25.062]  Who is doing that?
[01:39:25.142 --> 01:39:26.923]  Apparently, it's the Air Force?
[01:39:26.963 --> 01:39:27.683]  Yeah, whatever.
[01:39:27.703 --> 01:39:31.785]  There's some kind of Air Force tankers spraying some stuff up there for whatever reason.
[01:39:32.165 --> 01:39:33.806]  You know, I don't really know why.
[01:39:34.106 --> 01:39:35.246]  If you want... That stuff is poison.
[01:39:35.547 --> 01:39:36.707]  If you want to go... Stuff will kill you.
[01:39:37.447 --> 01:39:38.848]  If you want to go to a website that
[01:39:39.503 --> 01:39:39.904]  I think so.
[01:39:56.229 --> 01:39:59.651]  Go to Carnicom.com and there's a lot of information on there, a lot of videos.
[01:39:59.932 --> 01:40:01.473]  Now there's no question that they exist.
[01:40:01.913 --> 01:40:06.856]  You know, the big controversy is exactly what's in them, what they're made of, and what's the purpose.
[01:40:06.876 --> 01:40:13.280]  The purpose is anywhere from weather modification to redirecting of energy from that array in Alaska.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.561]  The purpose is peculiar.
[01:40:14.862 --> 01:40:16.102]  Magnificent.
[01:40:16.523 --> 01:40:17.964]  Whatever it is, it's not good.
[01:40:18.704 --> 01:40:19.765]  Whatever it is, it's not good.
[01:40:20.165 --> 01:40:21.106]  Well, Tom, thank you for the call.
[01:40:21.126 --> 01:40:21.726]  I appreciate it.
[01:40:22.206 --> 01:40:24.728]  Yeah, Kim Curls, that's an interesting subject.
[01:40:27.522 --> 01:40:35.668]  There needs to be a lot more concrete information about that out there and I think that ConnerCom.com has a lot of it.
[01:40:36.209 --> 01:40:41.192]  Okay we're going next to looks like it's Ken I hope I got that right in Baltimore.
[01:40:41.753 --> 01:40:43.954]  Ken are you there?
[01:40:43.974 --> 01:40:48.598]  Is this Ken in Baltimore?
[01:40:49.138 --> 01:40:50.699]  Yes it is, it's Ken in Baltimore.
[01:40:50.939 --> 01:40:55.823]  I was in Baltimore one time many years ago right there by the water there where they got that old antique
[01:40:57.461 --> 01:41:01.944]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:41:01.984 --> 01:41:03.505]  I really thought that was cool.
[01:41:03.545 --> 01:41:04.385]  I visited that thing.
[01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:04.765]  That's neat.
[01:41:04.805 --> 01:41:05.406]  Is it still there?
[01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:07.667]  Yeah, it's still there.
[01:41:07.867 --> 01:41:12.249]  You can take a step back into the time when our nation was founded.
[01:41:12.309 --> 01:41:14.050]  You know what I thought when I was on that ship?
[01:41:14.530 --> 01:41:22.975]  I was looking at how everything was done and they were talking about where they stored everything and all those ropes everywhere and cleats and pulleys and everything.
[01:41:23.275 --> 01:41:25.176]  There's no way they could have built that ship.
[01:41:25.956 --> 01:41:30.879]  If the United States government was in place at the time, because the thing was totally unsafe.
[01:41:31.660 --> 01:41:32.641]  You trip over everything.
[01:41:33.301 --> 01:41:35.503]  I mean, you know, it's kind of funny.
[01:41:35.603 --> 01:41:36.663]  What you got on your mind, Ken?
[01:41:37.404 --> 01:41:38.865]  Well, I got a couple of things.
[01:41:39.245 --> 01:41:48.712]  There's a, they're just building a new, I guess you could call it an interlock between 695 and 95.
[01:41:48.752 --> 01:41:52.234]  And it's kind of a unique shape.
[01:41:52.314 --> 01:41:53.535]  It's in the shape of a cross.
[01:41:54.700 --> 01:42:00.585]  It's probably the most unique interchange, and it is going to be a toll interchange.
[01:42:00.705 --> 01:42:02.306]  Are these state highways?
[01:42:04.228 --> 01:42:07.130]  Actually, I believe it's interstate 695 to 95.
[01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:10.093]  Yeah, are those interstate highways?
[01:42:10.113 --> 01:42:12.254]  They are.
[01:42:12.494 --> 01:42:17.799]  Yeah, you kind of wonder, again, specifically state to state, why is that?
[01:42:18.159 --> 01:42:21.862]  Is that one of those toll projects under the safety loo law passed in 2005?
[01:42:22.162 --> 01:42:22.863]  Is that one of those
[01:42:23.795 --> 01:42:30.479]  I think the whole idea behind it is to get rid of the bottlenecking from 695 corridor to 295.
[01:42:30.559 --> 01:42:36.883]  But I think it actually comes under the, and I'm not positive, I think it comes under the jurisdiction of the Maryland Toll Facilities.
[01:42:54.897 --> 01:43:05.060]  Again, I would ask that you check into why they think they can toll an interstate facility unless it's under that Safety Loo Pilot Program.
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:20.005]  You have to go to Baltimore and check that out because, again, we're coming up with these rumors of these federal toll projects on interstate highways which, to my understanding, is not legal yet.
[01:43:22.904 --> 01:43:26.946]  All right, Kennedy, you got anything else you want to add to the show today?
[01:43:27.066 --> 01:43:36.611]  I've been doing a little research into the whole Mort Gowans, chemtrails, cell phone, e.l.f., Glen Tower nanotechnology.
[01:43:36.631 --> 01:43:43.775]  I mean, that's a pretty big ball to swallow there, but I think that all these things are related.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:56.669]  If anybody has any information that they want to add, I think that these things definitely need to be looked into because I think that they're trying to transform us through the technology.
[01:43:57.130 --> 01:43:59.572]  Yeah, you're breaking up, Ken.
[01:43:59.612 --> 01:44:00.692]  I'm going to have to let you go.
[01:44:00.752 --> 01:44:03.134]  Your phone's breaking up, but he's got some good points there.
[01:44:03.535 --> 01:44:07.798]  Yeah, you know, this New World Order stuff is multifaceted.
[01:44:08.596 --> 01:44:11.739]  Everywhere you look, these people are messing with you.
[01:44:11.999 --> 01:44:14.161]  It's not just the highways.
[01:44:15.002 --> 01:44:17.183]  It's not just your national sovereignty.
[01:44:17.844 --> 01:44:18.945]  It's your education.
[01:44:19.025 --> 01:44:20.907]  It's what they put in the food.
[01:44:20.947 --> 01:44:24.069]  It's what they don't allow you to have in your food.
[01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:29.274]  It's suppression of medical technology.
[01:44:29.474 --> 01:44:31.255]  Oh, by the way, that brings me up to this.
[01:44:31.315 --> 01:44:33.097]  I want to make an announcement here about that.
[01:44:33.117 --> 01:44:34.158]  That reminds me of something.
[01:44:34.742 --> 01:44:49.781]  On our show The Simple Truth, which is again local cable TV access, it's on Monday nights from 6 to 7 on Channel 10 here in Austin, we're going to replay something that we played several years ago about cancer.
[01:44:50.802 --> 01:44:53.546]  It's an anecdotal story about a
[01:44:54.851 --> 01:45:16.970]  We're going to be playing a segment of that on our show next Monday and of course a couple of days later anybody in the United States can go to Google Video and watch it and basically it's a two-part thing.
[01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:20.193]  We're going to do one part Monday and then we're probably going to do the next one the next Monday.
[01:45:20.848 --> 01:45:29.497]  It's about the intentional suppression of alternative cancer cures by the chemical pharmaceutical industry in this country.
[01:45:29.957 --> 01:45:31.559]  That's the bigger picture.
[01:45:31.599 --> 01:45:41.028]  And then this anecdotal story is from a very, very credible person that we interviewed back in 2003 who had been cured of cancer
[01:45:43.720 --> 01:45:44.160]  We're good to go.
[01:46:13.971 --> 01:46:16.972]  Okay, we've got Pam in Texas up next.
[01:46:17.112 --> 01:46:18.273]  Pam, are you still there?
[01:46:18.833 --> 01:46:20.734]  Hello, Bob Dacey, brother in liberty.
[01:46:21.034 --> 01:46:24.755]  This is Pam Farley with the Austin Ron Paul Revolution.
[01:46:24.915 --> 01:46:25.335]  How are you?
[01:46:25.415 --> 01:46:26.176]  Oh, how are you doing?
[01:46:26.216 --> 01:46:27.076]  Good to talk to you.
[01:46:27.316 --> 01:46:28.957]  Good to talk to you, too.
[01:46:29.237 --> 01:46:30.397]  Hey, that reminds me of something.
[01:46:30.417 --> 01:46:32.538]  Before you get started, I want to say something.
[01:46:32.858 --> 01:46:33.618]  Okay.
[01:46:33.718 --> 01:46:40.881]  To all you people in the Central Texas area, I sell Ron Paul signs, yard signs, in my store.
[01:46:41.767 --> 01:46:42.870]  For what they cost me.
[01:46:43.250 --> 01:46:44.954]  Because I don't want to make any money on this deal.
[01:46:44.974 --> 01:46:45.475]  I think they're like...
[01:46:46.079 --> 01:46:51.181]  I would like to invite listeners in the Austin area to first go by your store, get a Ron Paul sign,
[01:47:15.928 --> 01:47:22.894]  Put on the Ron Paul t-shirt and join us in front of the Capitol building tomorrow afternoon at 1 p.m.
[01:47:23.554 --> 01:47:25.456]  on the 11th Street side of the Capitol.
[01:47:25.856 --> 01:47:27.557]  We're having a March for Ron Paul.
[01:47:28.218 --> 01:47:31.821]  And this is part of a nationwide Walk for Ron Paul event.
[01:47:31.961 --> 01:47:38.526]  So no matter what city you're in, go to meetup.com and find the Ron Paul group for your city.
[01:47:39.281 --> 01:47:39.821]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:47:39.841 --> 01:47:44.662]  Ron Paul is the real deal and the thing I've noticed about the campaign in the Austin area is the phenomenal
[01:48:02.691 --> 01:48:04.875]  I don't know what the word is.
[01:48:04.955 --> 01:48:05.997]  The diversity of it?
[01:48:06.017 --> 01:48:13.650]  I hate to use that word because it's so overused, but I attended one of those Ron Paul organizing groups several months ago.
[01:48:14.398 --> 01:48:17.941]  And I was stunned at the types of people that were there.
[01:48:17.961 --> 01:48:24.947]  There was like Goldwater Republicans standing up and said, I'm a Goldwater Republican and I'm going for Ron Paul.
[01:48:25.007 --> 01:48:31.352]  And then some guy would get up and say, I'm an independent who hates politics, but I think Ron Paul is cool.
[01:48:31.372 --> 01:48:34.794]  And some hippie would get up and say, man, I'm a disaffected Democrat.
[01:48:35.335 --> 01:48:38.097]  And I'm so sick of those same old same old from those guys.
[01:48:38.177 --> 01:48:39.558]  I'm going to go for Ron Paul.
[01:48:39.598 --> 01:48:41.500]  And there's old people and young people.
[01:48:42.201 --> 01:48:43.203]  I think so.
[01:48:52.981 --> 01:49:00.388]  So diverse and the creative energy and intelligence of these people, it's breathtaking.
[01:49:00.468 --> 01:49:03.891]  We're talking about real grassroots here, like real activism.
[01:49:04.252 --> 01:49:09.156]  It's not like phony baloney activism like some of these people that were promoting the toll roads.
[01:49:09.517 --> 01:49:12.980]  You know, everybody that showed up for the toll roads had a financial interest in it.
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:19.945]  These Ron Paul guys, I mean, it is awesome.
[01:49:19.965 --> 01:49:25.010]  He's picking up support from all over the false political spectrum.
[01:49:25.150 --> 01:49:28.033]  It's quite a phenomenon to watch.
[01:49:28.553 --> 01:49:29.614]  Pam, I appreciate your call.
[01:49:29.634 --> 01:49:31.436]  That's a good little plug for Ron Paul.
[01:49:31.476 --> 01:49:34.339]  Y'all get down to State Capitol tomorrow and participate.
[01:49:34.619 --> 01:49:36.441]  Watch what real political activism is.
[01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:38.583]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones, back in a few.
[01:49:53.997 --> 01:49:55.378]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.398 --> 01:49:57.518]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.239 --> 01:50:03.080]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:03.140 --> 01:50:05.901]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:05.941 --> 01:50:08.181]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:50:08.741 --> 01:50:11.162]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:11.918 --> 01:50:19.265]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.287 --> 01:50:27.232]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:27.732 --> 01:50:31.195]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.576 --> 01:50:34.098]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[01:50:34.158 --> 01:50:35.299]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.319 --> 01:50:36.060]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.141]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.361 --> 01:50:38.181]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.342 --> 01:50:39.242]  That's what they're after.
[01:50:39.503 --> 01:50:47.309]  Order End Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:47.389 --> 01:50:50.993]  End Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:51.033 --> 01:50:52.174]  You have been warned.
[01:50:52.825 --> 01:50:57.928]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:57.988 --> 01:51:05.313]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:05.453 --> 01:51:16.079]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:16.279 --> 01:51:20.822]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:21.102 --> 01:51:26.104]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:26.304 --> 01:51:29.245]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:29.465 --> 01:51:39.269]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:56.082]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:51:56.322 --> 01:51:58.423]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:51:58.583 --> 01:52:01.044]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:52:01.304 --> 01:52:05.666]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:52:05.706 --> 01:52:06.387]  Here's why.
[01:52:06.787 --> 01:52:12.729]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:18.952]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:52:19.193 --> 01:52:20.113]  But they're not cheating.
[01:52:20.353 --> 01:52:24.338]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:52:24.538 --> 01:52:28.863]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:52:28.983 --> 01:52:36.271]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:52:36.271 --> 01:52:37.372]  I don't need no education
[01:53:07.190 --> 01:53:09.312]  Well, we really do need a lot of education.
[01:53:09.352 --> 01:53:11.093]  We just don't need it from those guys.
[01:53:11.294 --> 01:53:12.415]  We need it from our guys.
[01:53:13.035 --> 01:53:25.568]  One of the things you can do if you want to be educated about what's going on and help to stop the North American Union, John Birch Society has a new special edition of the New American Magazine out that just came out.
[01:53:26.255 --> 01:53:52.778]  It's the October 15th edition and if you want to help out you want to learn about what's going on and you want to disseminate this information to others you can go to www.aobs-store.com that's American Opinion Book Services www.aobs-store.com or go to jbs.org you'll get there and you can buy a bunch of these copies
[01:53:53.479 --> 01:53:59.342]  of this special edition of the New American totally devoted to the North American Union.
[01:54:00.022 --> 01:54:04.924]  And there's also, you can get a PDF file on it too.
[01:54:05.044 --> 01:54:06.825]  I mean you can do all kinds of stuff with this stuff.
[01:54:07.285 --> 01:54:08.606]  Go visit it.
[01:54:08.646 --> 01:54:10.127]  Get copies of this magazine.
[01:54:10.707 --> 01:54:12.848]  It's the North American Union edition.
[01:54:13.108 --> 01:54:19.971]  And by the way, it has an article by one of the producers of my TV show, Kelly Taylor, having to do with the NAFTA Superhighway.
[01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:31.319]  So, you know, go to JBS.org, go to the American Opinion Book Service's website, and order up a whole bunch of these things and pass them out to everybody and his brother you know who can think.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:32.781]  Okay?
[01:54:33.361 --> 01:54:34.823]  Because it's all about information.
[01:54:34.883 --> 01:54:35.843]  Information is power.
[01:54:35.884 --> 01:54:36.664]  Knowledge is power.
[01:54:38.086 --> 01:54:42.450]  And if every American could have a copy of this new American and see
[01:54:44.431 --> 01:54:47.133]  All the concrete proof about this North American Union.
[01:54:47.334 --> 01:54:51.698]  See, the problem with the North American Union, ladies and gentlemen, is this is it.
[01:54:52.498 --> 01:54:53.840]  We can't let them get away with this.
[01:54:54.260 --> 01:55:05.010]  If they get away with a merger of the United States, Canada, and Mexico into one entity, one political entity, we're going to be toast.
[01:55:05.831 --> 01:55:09.134]  And this is the front-line battle right now
[01:55:10.305 --> 01:55:12.206]  I have got Richard in Texas on the line.
[01:55:12.286 --> 01:55:12.946]  Richard, are you there?
[01:55:37.303 --> 01:55:41.386]  Hello Bob, it's Richard down in South Austin at one of the other auxiliary command bunkers.
[01:55:42.206 --> 01:55:42.867]  Richard Reeves?
[01:55:43.367 --> 01:55:44.468]  Yes sir, that's right.
[01:55:44.608 --> 01:55:46.509]  How do you always manage to get into this show?
[01:55:46.529 --> 01:55:47.970]  You're a sneaky little devil, aren't you?
[01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:50.691]  Well, I tell you what, when I hear you on the air, I'm calling in, you know?
[01:55:50.911 --> 01:55:52.673]  Oh yeah, because I'm so good, right?
[01:55:53.113 --> 01:55:54.414]  That's right, I love you Bob.
[01:55:54.434 --> 01:55:55.094]  Yeah, right.
[01:55:55.434 --> 01:55:59.457]  I tell you what, Art Bell has George Noory and Alex Jones has Bob Dacey.
[01:55:59.517 --> 01:56:00.537]  No, is that the way it works?
[01:56:01.238 --> 01:56:01.818]  Yes sir.
[01:56:02.238 --> 01:56:02.559]  Oh, gee.
[01:56:03.812 --> 01:56:08.794]  I was calling you for several reasons, and one of them is about the Pennsylvania story, about the I-80 Pennsylvania story.
[01:56:08.974 --> 01:56:09.234]  Yeah.
[01:56:09.474 --> 01:56:10.774]  And that is true.
[01:56:11.415 --> 01:56:22.918]  What they had was they had some federal legislation that passed this summer, and I first caught wind of it during the summertime, and then I heard there were some amendments added on to it that would stop the tolling of interstates.
[01:56:23.699 --> 01:56:26.780]  And so I kind of thought, well, okay, you know, that problem's not going to happen.
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:31.021]  But then, lo and behold, they stripped that out, and it got passed.
[01:56:32.642 --> 01:56:33.182]  And so now,
[01:56:33.959 --> 01:56:37.782]  What it is, remember the story you caught, Wendell, where they were going to try to toll I-35?
[01:56:37.922 --> 01:56:38.403]  Right.
[01:56:39.704 --> 01:56:43.627]  And the catch was that the state of Texas would have to buy I-35 back.
[01:56:43.667 --> 01:56:54.576]  Well, that's the same thing in Pennsylvania, is that Pennsylvania will supposedly, with the money that they don't have to build and maintain roads with, will buy I-80 back and then put it back out as a toll road.
[01:56:54.656 --> 01:56:58.779]  So basically, it's the same thing that happened in Texas, just it blueprinted up in Pennsylvania.
[01:56:59.634 --> 01:57:00.115]  Exactly.
[01:57:00.155 --> 01:57:01.956]  Now, I drove 18-wheelers for 20 years.
[01:57:02.016 --> 01:57:04.478]  In 10 years, I was over the road 48 states.
[01:57:04.638 --> 01:57:09.902]  And I tell you what, I-80 is absolutely the Aorta of the United States.
[01:57:10.342 --> 01:57:21.951]  Well, you have all these, you have about 38 to 40 states that feed traffic into I-80 that goes up into this Northeast, highly populated Manhattan, New York City.
[01:57:22.571 --> 01:57:24.113]  All this Northeast corridor is fed
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:27.862]  Richard, hold that thought.
[01:57:27.882 --> 01:57:29.243]  We'll take you after the break.
[01:57:29.644 --> 01:57:31.165]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones.
[01:57:33.727 --> 01:57:37.650]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.970 --> 01:57:38.751]  Or call toll free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.009 --> 01:57:54.215]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.856 --> 01:57:55.677]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.438 --> 01:57:57.399]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:01.785]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.185 --> 01:58:06.231]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.277 --> 01:58:09.978]  No, he's not Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.098 --> 01:58:11.078]  He's Bob Dacey.
[01:58:11.138 --> 01:58:35.389]  Substituting for Alex Jones, this third hour of the Alex Jones Show, this October the 12th, 2007, Alex is taking a well-deserved little mini-vacation, and he'll be back on Wednesday, and I, Bob Dacey, the host of the Simple Truth TV Show in Austin, am writing substitute shotgun for the inimitable Alex Jones today, Monday, and Tuesday,
[01:58:36.292 --> 01:58:47.458]  So that's just the way it is and before the break we were talking to Richard Reeves from Austin, Texas and we're talking about the fact that Pennsylvania is getting stuck with these highway things just like Texas is.
[01:58:47.498 --> 01:58:48.539]  What else about that Richard?
[01:58:49.379 --> 01:58:57.584]  Well I tell you we really have to help the folks in Pennsylvania out on this because to my knowledge this is the first interstate in danger.
[01:58:58.288 --> 01:58:58.829]  I don't know.
[01:59:15.768 --> 01:59:16.949]  To let these things happen.
[01:59:16.969 --> 01:59:19.870]  And yesterday I did email you a story to your email box.
[01:59:21.010 --> 01:59:23.911]  It's titled, if you're concerned about Rose, this is a red alert.
[01:59:24.732 --> 01:59:29.674]  That's what I saw, Richard, and I glanced at it and I was like, what?
[01:59:29.714 --> 01:59:31.555]  My first reaction was, well, they can't do that.
[01:59:31.755 --> 01:59:34.656]  It's not legal yet, but apparently there's something going on up there.
[01:59:34.796 --> 01:59:35.696]  Something nefarious.
[01:59:35.816 --> 01:59:36.396]  Absolutely.
[01:59:36.597 --> 01:59:37.417]  Absolutely.
[01:59:37.637 --> 01:59:44.840]  And like that caller from Pennsylvania earlier said, they're trying to good cop, bad cop situation where they say, well, if you just
[01:59:45.467 --> 01:59:50.288]  If you don't want to let us toll I-80, then I guess we're just going to have to sell the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which is I-76.
[01:59:50.308 --> 02:00:01.571]  And what it was is I-76 evidently was grandfathered in decades ago as the Pennsylvania Turnpike, and that's the reason I-76 is a toll road.
[02:00:02.171 --> 02:00:09.433]  And I know also in Kansas, I think parts of I-70 are toll roads there, and that's an interstate.
[02:00:09.473 --> 02:00:13.134]  But as far as existing interstates being converted over to toll roads,
[02:00:13.607 --> 02:00:17.329]  This is the first one that I'm aware of here in recent memory.
[02:00:18.690 --> 02:00:24.953]  Originally, I called because you were talking about Sarah Eckhart and the Campo board and all the things that went on here locally.
[02:00:25.633 --> 02:00:28.895]  I'll tell you what, it was a pretty devastating night up there Monday at Campo.
[02:00:29.615 --> 02:00:41.561]  It was easy to be disappointed, but nonetheless, we had the work we've done, Bob, you and Sal Costello and Mary Anderson and many other folks have done here in the Austin area, too many to name.
[02:00:41.986 --> 02:00:42.426]  And you too.
[02:00:42.486 --> 02:00:44.527]  We got some significant victories.
[02:00:45.147 --> 02:00:47.168]  We got some significant victories on Monday.
[02:00:48.369 --> 02:00:54.311]  Some of those were two stretches of freeways that were supposed to be tolled are freeways now.
[02:00:54.791 --> 02:01:02.615]  And that's on S-871 from I-35 to Riverside and then on 183 from I-35 to Springdale.
[02:01:02.675 --> 02:01:05.896]  Those were originally supposed to be tollways right in that area.
[02:01:06.256 --> 02:01:07.296]  So we're peeling them off.
[02:01:08.357 --> 02:01:09.637]  We peeled off those sections.
[02:01:09.717 --> 02:01:10.838]  Now the price of
[02:01:11.477 --> 02:01:14.059]  Liberty is to be vigilant forever.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.961]  So we're going to have to be vigilant on those.
[02:01:17.062 --> 02:01:22.806]  And we will continue working on peeling off these sections that they did manage to get toll slapped on.
[02:01:23.467 --> 02:01:32.434]  And as far as, sorry, Eckhardt's amendments, they're pretty weak because them putting an amendment out that says, well, the money's going to stay in our neighborhood.
[02:01:32.874 --> 02:01:39.980]  All they're going to do is do the accounting trick and gasoline and transportation taxes, traditional transportation taxes,
[02:01:40.464 --> 02:01:43.265]  That should stay here and or come in here.
[02:01:43.725 --> 02:01:45.466]  Well, they'll just they're just going to disappear that.
[02:01:47.087 --> 02:01:48.907]  Yeah, you know, yeah, you got to.
[02:01:49.067 --> 02:01:51.308]  Well, when Kirk Watson's running it, you got to watch out.
[02:01:51.408 --> 02:01:52.168]  That's all there is to it.
[02:01:52.849 --> 02:01:53.629]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:01:53.729 --> 02:01:55.750]  So I tell you what, we're in deep trouble.
[02:01:55.770 --> 02:02:03.933]  But here's the thing is, I don't hear anybody on the Campbell board, including Senator Eckhardt, saying, hey, we know there's money for roads.
[02:02:04.805 --> 02:02:05.886]  And we just need to get it.
[02:02:05.986 --> 02:02:09.247]  We need to have a commitment by the state legislature.
[02:02:09.327 --> 02:02:16.131]  We need to have a commitment by the federal legislature and the executive branch of Texas and of D.C., the nation.
[02:02:16.644 --> 02:02:17.064]  We're good to go.
[02:02:45.532 --> 02:02:50.634]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:02:50.694 --> 02:02:57.997]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:02:58.157 --> 02:03:08.782]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:03:08.982 --> 02:03:13.524]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:03:13.804 --> 02:03:18.809]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:03:19.009 --> 02:03:21.951]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:22.172 --> 02:03:31.920]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:03:45.708 --> 02:03:47.109]  It is a big idea.
[02:03:47.129 --> 02:03:49.230]  A new world order.
[02:03:49.951 --> 02:03:54.133]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:03:54.834 --> 02:03:57.636]  It's known as the Bilderberg Theory.
[02:03:57.676 --> 02:03:59.877]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:04:00.447 --> 02:04:02.892]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:04:03.633 --> 02:04:10.967]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:04:13.979 --> 02:04:18.962]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:04:19.443 --> 02:04:22.925]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:04:23.285 --> 02:04:25.807]  Bill of Rights makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:04:25.867 --> 02:04:27.008]  Most people have no idea.
[02:04:27.028 --> 02:04:27.768]  They're not after money.
[02:04:27.788 --> 02:04:28.869]  They have all the money they need.
[02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.850]  They're after power.
[02:04:30.070 --> 02:04:31.191]  That's what they have to use it for.

[02:04:42.738 --> 02:04:43.799]  You have been warned.
[02:04:44.599 --> 02:04:45.159]  Hey Emily!
[02:04:45.439 --> 02:04:46.300]  Wow, you look great!
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:47.340]  I feel great!
[02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.361]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:04:49.641 --> 02:04:49.941]  Really?
[02:04:50.181 --> 02:04:50.581]  What is it?
[02:04:50.801 --> 02:04:51.261]  How does it work?
[02:04:51.461 --> 02:04:58.043]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[02:04:58.203 --> 02:05:00.484]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:05:00.684 --> 02:05:06.006]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you!
[02:05:06.346 --> 02:05:06.806]  That's it?
[02:05:07.046 --> 02:05:08.627]  Well, it sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:05:08.887 --> 02:05:09.587]  It is easy.
[02:05:09.807 --> 02:05:16.510]  Plus, the FDA says Flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:05:16.790 --> 02:05:18.290]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:19.331]  That's amazing!
[02:05:19.731 --> 02:05:25.073]  And, the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:05:25.393 --> 02:05:25.733]  Well, how?
[02:05:25.933 --> 02:05:27.054]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?

[02:05:58.149 --> 02:06:01.970]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:06.392]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.803 --> 02:06:18.565]  Okay, once again, this is Bob Casey substituting for Alex Jones here on the 12th day of October 2007.
[02:06:18.645 --> 02:06:23.887]  Before I go to David in California, and Sue in California, and Mike in St.
[02:06:23.907 --> 02:06:26.407]  Louis, before I go to them, I want to make an announcement here.
[02:06:26.807 --> 02:06:28.028]  I have been remiss.
[02:06:28.868 --> 02:06:35.810]  Endgame, for those of you in the Austin area, is going to be playing live at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema.
[02:06:36.881 --> 02:06:37.621]  I don't
[02:06:59.119 --> 02:07:00.260]  They have a website up.
[02:07:00.340 --> 02:07:04.965]  It's www.endgamethemovie.com.
[02:07:05.425 --> 02:07:09.209]  Let me repeat that for those of you who didn't have a pencil ready yet.
[02:07:09.810 --> 02:07:17.277]  It's www.endgamethemovie.com.
[02:07:17.837 --> 02:07:20.280]  So go there and get you some tickets to the
[02:07:22.285 --> 02:07:49.538]  In game live at the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema the premiere engagement that's October the 22nd 23rd and 24th and November the 5th and November the 7th and Alex will be there live on October the 22nd and on November the 5th so you could also go to the Alamo Drafthouse website to get more details but ingamethemovie.com
[02:07:50.569 --> 02:07:53.371]  Go see the premiere here of Endgame.
[02:07:53.471 --> 02:07:54.111]  So there you go.
[02:07:54.732 --> 02:07:55.733]  Very important stuff.
[02:07:56.213 --> 02:07:59.395]  Now we got David in California has been waiting for a while.
[02:07:59.415 --> 02:08:00.456]  David, are you still there?
[02:08:00.476 --> 02:08:02.637]  Hello.
[02:08:02.837 --> 02:08:04.218]  You haven't fallen asleep yet, have you?
[02:08:04.238 --> 02:08:06.500]  No, actually I've been listening the whole time.
[02:08:06.520 --> 02:08:07.300]  You all are calm.
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:14.085]  The reason I called is actually I'm out here in Palmdale, California, which is one of the legs of the military industrial complex.
[02:08:14.585 --> 02:08:17.387]  I woke up about five years ago, Alex, when I saw
[02:08:19.364 --> 02:08:20.005]  I don't think so.
[02:08:48.507 --> 02:08:49.088]  I don't know.
[02:09:08.362 --> 02:09:09.763]  Yeah, on any given situation.
[02:09:09.823 --> 02:09:14.305]  I'll give you kind of a generic answer to that question from my own perspective.
[02:09:14.846 --> 02:09:15.406]  Okay.
[02:09:15.606 --> 02:09:18.187]  And I'll go ahead and let you go and you can just listen to my answer.
[02:09:18.227 --> 02:09:19.028]  Thank you for that call.
[02:09:19.968 --> 02:09:29.974]  You know, that's a tough question because, you know, people that know this stuff are so full of information and they want to just spew it out to everybody all at the same time.
[02:09:30.554 --> 02:09:31.775]  And they want to tell you, did you know this?
[02:09:31.795 --> 02:09:32.335]  Did you know this?
[02:09:32.355 --> 02:09:32.835]  Did you know this?
[02:09:32.855 --> 02:09:33.396]  Did you know this?
[02:09:33.416 --> 02:09:33.956]  Did you know this?
[02:09:34.656 --> 02:09:37.678]  And it overwhelms people because the stuff
[02:09:38.524 --> 02:09:50.854]  The provable things that we know, you know, you want to talk about September 11th, you want to talk about the North American Union, whatever you want to talk about is too much for the average neophyte to handle.
[02:09:51.254 --> 02:09:52.075]  They shut it off.
[02:09:53.196 --> 02:10:01.983]  And what I try to do is I try to just plant a seed about one topic that interests somebody.
[02:10:02.283 --> 02:10:05.306]  Just open that door just a little crack to let the light in.
[02:10:06.483 --> 02:10:12.407]  And let them explore it themselves and realize for themselves what's going on.
[02:10:13.087 --> 02:10:23.073]  It's kind of like if you've got 10,000 people in a giant auditorium and there's only one door, they're not all going to get out the door.
[02:10:23.193 --> 02:10:28.376]  You've got to just crack a little bit of light, let it get in there, and let it ferment.
[02:10:28.416 --> 02:10:30.478]  That's what happened with me.
[02:10:30.978 --> 02:10:34.400]  I was a conservative Republican par excellence.
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:35.401]  I thought I knew everything.
[02:10:36.604 --> 02:10:40.286]  I listened to Rush Limbaugh and all that stuff.
[02:10:40.386 --> 02:10:41.687]  I read the newspaper all the time.
[02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:44.528]  Those dirty liberals would always slant the news and all that.
[02:10:45.368 --> 02:10:46.609]  I thought I was aware.
[02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:48.850]  I was a member of the Republican National Committee.
[02:10:48.890 --> 02:10:53.012]  I got a big medal thing from the Reagan era.
[02:10:53.833 --> 02:10:59.555]  Alex Jones was the guy who said something I didn't know who the guy was.
[02:10:59.896 --> 02:11:03.157]  He said something back in 1998 about the U.N.
[02:11:03.177 --> 02:11:04.598]  taking over the national park system.
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:06.540]  And I'm like, what?
[02:11:08.081 --> 02:11:08.741]  Uh-uh.
[02:11:09.541 --> 02:11:14.863]  And so my curiosity, that little door was opened just a little bit for my curiosity.
[02:11:15.343 --> 02:11:17.183]  And I looked into what he had to say.
[02:11:17.283 --> 02:11:19.744]  And lo and behold, the U.N.
[02:11:19.784 --> 02:11:20.944]  confirmed what he had to say.
[02:11:20.964 --> 02:11:23.145]  The state of Kentucky confirmed what he had to say.
[02:11:23.445 --> 02:11:28.827]  And all of a sudden, that little seed that got inside my brain exploded.
[02:11:29.847 --> 02:11:30.107]  You know?
[02:11:31.144 --> 02:11:35.230]  And over these last several years, I mean, it's a hard thing to accept.
[02:11:35.250 --> 02:11:43.503]  I mean, I fought it all the way, you know, but when you get, when you get that seed in you that one thing is like, wait a minute, I didn't know this.
[02:11:44.406 --> 02:11:45.087]  This isn't right.
[02:11:45.107 --> 02:11:46.127]  I thought I kept up.
[02:11:46.588 --> 02:11:49.030]  What is this biodiversity treaty nonsense?
[02:11:49.090 --> 02:11:52.953]  And why is Clinton trying to implement it even though it hadn't been ratified by the U.S.
[02:11:52.993 --> 02:11:53.413]  Senate?
[02:11:53.793 --> 02:11:56.075]  And why is the state of Kentucky saying never do this?
[02:11:56.175 --> 02:12:00.979]  And why are they saying they don't want foreign minions in control of Kentucky land?
[02:12:01.739 --> 02:12:05.482]  And what is this kook Alex Jones doing telling me this stuff which is true?
[02:12:06.303 --> 02:12:06.563]  You know?
[02:12:06.903 --> 02:12:12.828]  So I'm saying that one of the things to do to wake people up is don't overwhelm them.
[02:12:12.868 --> 02:12:14.109]  And that's so hard.
[02:12:14.770 --> 02:12:15.210]  Yes, I think so.
[02:12:46.530 --> 02:12:47.811]  We're good to go!
[02:13:12.614 --> 02:13:13.514]  And they go, which one is that?
[02:13:13.534 --> 02:13:18.756]  And you say, well, that's the one about searching and seizing and having to go get a warrant and showing reasonable cause before you search and seize.
[02:13:18.776 --> 02:13:20.797]  And they go, yeah, yeah, that stuff.
[02:13:20.897 --> 02:13:22.297]  Well, is that the supreme law of the land?
[02:13:22.457 --> 02:13:23.298]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:23.718 --> 02:13:25.598]  Well, have you read the Patriot Act, section 213?
[02:13:25.638 --> 02:13:25.738]  No.
[02:13:25.878 --> 02:13:28.419]  Well, here it is right here.
[02:13:29.340 --> 02:13:31.320]  Well, it says you don't need a warrant.
[02:13:31.860 --> 02:13:32.361]  I say, yeah.
[02:13:33.401 --> 02:13:35.942]  So then I hit him with the other question.
[02:13:35.962 --> 02:13:39.743]  Well, did President Bush break his oath of office when he signed the Patriot Act into law?
[02:13:40.464 --> 02:13:41.025]  We're good to go.
[02:14:08.220 --> 02:14:11.822]  Okay, next caller I think is Sue from California.
[02:14:11.862 --> 02:14:12.642]  Sue, are you there?
[02:14:14.663 --> 02:14:16.164]  Sue from California, are you there?
[02:14:16.364 --> 02:14:16.704]  Hello?
[02:14:16.964 --> 02:14:18.305]  Hi Sue, you've been waiting a while.
[02:14:18.345 --> 02:14:18.905]  How are you doing?
[02:14:19.145 --> 02:14:20.926]  Good, thanks for taking my call.
[02:14:20.946 --> 02:14:23.087]  I appreciate this opportunity to talk about an issue.
[02:14:23.127 --> 02:14:32.951]  I'm here on the California coast in the Monterey Bay area and we're on the front lines of a biochemical pesticide aerial attack by the California Department of Food and Agriculture.
[02:14:32.971 --> 02:14:35.032]  You mean they're spraying stuff all over everything?
[02:14:35.372 --> 02:14:36.833]  They sprayed last month in
[02:14:37.432 --> 02:14:44.457]  Monterey and after they sprayed this biochemical pesticide at a 400 foot elevation I came down like rain.
[02:14:44.837 --> 02:14:48.359]  A number of people got sick, maybe went to the hospital and all sorts of things.
[02:14:48.740 --> 02:14:49.960]  What are they trying to eradicate?
[02:14:50.581 --> 02:14:51.622]  Yep, you're right on.
[02:14:51.642 --> 02:14:53.623]  The sea fly or what?
[02:14:54.483 --> 02:14:58.506]  Actually it's this light brown apple moss.
[02:14:59.227 --> 02:15:00.207]  The apple moss?
[02:15:00.447 --> 02:15:00.808]  Yeah.
[02:15:01.068 --> 02:15:01.848]  What are they spraying?
[02:15:02.169 --> 02:15:03.189]  What kind of chemical do you know?
[02:15:03.530 --> 02:15:04.270]  Yeah, I sure do.
[02:15:06.204 --> 02:15:13.152]  It was reported in the Santa Cruz Sentinel, September 28, 2007, and the EPA gave them these ingredients, and it's 70% inert ingredients.
[02:15:15.246 --> 02:15:17.007]  We don't want that ingredient.
[02:15:17.027 --> 02:15:18.447]  What's the only inert ingredient?
[02:15:18.927 --> 02:15:21.328]  Actually, this is a pretty scary ingredient.
[02:15:21.368 --> 02:15:23.828]  It's polymethylene polyphenol isocyanate.
[02:15:23.948 --> 02:15:25.789]  That doesn't sound very good to me.
[02:15:25.849 --> 02:15:26.929]  That sounds bad.
[02:15:27.329 --> 02:15:32.131]  Actually, OSHA says that one exposure to this could lead to chronic long-lasting effects.
[02:15:32.251 --> 02:15:33.431]  That's the inert ingredient?
[02:15:33.691 --> 02:15:35.312]  Yeah, that's an inert ingredient.
[02:15:35.352 --> 02:15:38.993]  How can an inert ingredient lead to chronic long-lasting effects if it's inert?
[02:15:39.813 --> 02:15:44.254]  You would think that that would not be possible, but it actually is true, and it is so true
[02:15:44.873 --> 02:16:01.851]  That when the Santa Cruz Sentinel actually reported this ingredient, Sutura, the manufacturers of this biochemical pesticide, actually sent their lawyers to the Sentinel to recall all this information that they had printed and retracted from their website and try to get all their newspapers back.
[02:16:02.651 --> 02:16:04.994]  Sutura, the people who make this chemical, checkmates
[02:16:05.507 --> 02:16:10.210]  Actually, their lawyers are trying to do a big deal to try to keep this secret.
[02:16:10.270 --> 02:16:11.451]  Wait a minute.
[02:16:11.471 --> 02:16:12.692]  You've got to back up for a second.
[02:16:12.772 --> 02:16:14.093]  I'm kind of slow on the uptake.
[02:16:14.133 --> 02:16:24.601]  You're saying that the lawyers for the company that makes this stuff... They're claiming trade secret and that the Santa Cruz Sentinel should not have printed it.
[02:16:24.661 --> 02:16:30.545]  The Santa Cruz Sentinel, which is a newspaper, I lie, First Amendment Freedom of the Press, should not have printed
[02:16:31.449 --> 02:16:34.850]  That they're spraying this crud all over Southern California?
[02:16:36.031 --> 02:16:37.811]  Actually, Central California.
[02:16:38.151 --> 02:16:38.551]  Right, right.
[02:16:38.571 --> 02:16:40.392]  Small little town in Monterey and Santa Cruz.
[02:16:40.432 --> 02:16:44.233]  And the California Department of Food and Agriculture's plan is to spray up and down the coast.
[02:16:44.293 --> 02:16:50.155]  But yeah, their lawyers are sending out seats and dismiss and sending out letters that threaten people.
[02:16:50.757 --> 02:16:54.821]  And companies that reprint this name because it's, quote, a trade secret.
[02:16:54.901 --> 02:16:58.824]  Well, the name is just the name of a chemical compound, right?
[02:16:58.864 --> 02:17:01.686]  Well, you see, it's so dangerous that they just don't want people to know about it.
[02:17:01.706 --> 02:17:05.389]  Is there, like, a website people could go to to read up on this?
[02:17:05.409 --> 02:17:07.671]  Because I, like, totally, this is, like, out of left field with me.
[02:17:07.691 --> 02:17:08.592]  I don't know anything about it.
[02:17:08.932 --> 02:17:14.237]  It's out of left field for a lot of people because the California Department of Food and Agriculture don't want people to know about it.
[02:17:14.617 --> 02:17:22.382]  They've passed this pesticide spray with an emergency act because they claim it's an emergency under the FIRA Section 18 Act.
[02:17:22.402 --> 02:17:26.045]  So they didn't have to go through any testing or any normal ecological reviews.
[02:17:26.925 --> 02:17:29.407]  Chemtrails911.com has been reporting on this.
[02:17:30.048 --> 02:17:35.511]  LBAMspray.info has been reporting on this and we really need national attention on it.
[02:17:35.531 --> 02:17:37.733]  Alright, well we're up against the bright side, thank you.
[02:17:37.913 --> 02:17:38.934]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:17:39.034 --> 02:17:39.394]  Take care.
[02:17:45.692 --> 02:17:48.715]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:49.035 --> 02:17:53.959]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:54.219 --> 02:17:58.563]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:58.863 --> 02:18:07.791]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:07.991 --> 02:18:11.614]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:11.894 --> 02:18:16.922]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:17.222 --> 02:18:23.933]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:24.423 --> 02:18:25.104]  What about you?
[02:18:25.724 --> 02:18:31.089]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:18:31.129 --> 02:18:32.230]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[02:18:46.892 --> 02:18:47.854]  Ted Anders from Midas.
[02:18:47.934 --> 02:18:48.235]  October 11, 2007.
[02:18:48.295 --> 02:18:48.756]  Gold 745, 60 ounce.
[02:18:48.796 --> 02:18:51.381]  Gold coins can be purchased for $768.67, $379 for half, $189.50 per quarter.
[02:18:51.421 --> 02:18:51.822]  That's $768.67, $379, and $189.50.
[02:19:00.606 --> 02:19:02.828]  The dollar has fallen to 65% of the euro.
[02:19:02.928 --> 02:19:03.949]  Erosion accelerates.
[02:19:04.049 --> 02:19:11.435]  Mainline talk show hosts are trying to hold on to their support of the conservative movement, keeping focus on the Republican agenda and playing into the hand of the globalists.
[02:19:11.575 --> 02:19:14.978]  Dr. Corsi interviewed Robert Pastor of the American University.
[02:19:15.138 --> 02:19:21.703]  With the sleight of hand and incremental implementation, Pastor admits to the North American Union is being forced upon us.
[02:19:22.143 --> 02:19:26.827]  Corsi uncovers the CFR's plan to build a North American community similar to the EU.
[02:19:27.147 --> 02:19:32.352]  In his report, the North American Union isn't going away, Corsi exposes the deception and trickery.
[02:19:32.472 --> 02:19:36.195]  Call for your report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.275 --> 02:19:39.537]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:19:39.658 --> 02:19:39.938]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.958 --> 02:19:40.138]  That's 800-686-2237.

[02:20:29.480 --> 02:20:32.442]  These radios are not available anywhere else and for a limited time.
[02:20:32.642 --> 02:20:33.322]  So call now.
[02:20:33.562 --> 02:20:33.722]  Dial 877-817-9829.

[02:20:45.732 --> 02:20:47.574]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:20:47.714 --> 02:20:52.899]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:20:53.059 --> 02:20:54.420]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:20:54.680 --> 02:21:02.848]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:21:03.088 --> 02:21:08.813]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:21:08.973 --> 02:21:10.754]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:21:10.814 --> 02:21:12.955]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:21:13.115 --> 02:21:17.357]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:21:17.517 --> 02:21:19.678]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:21:19.738 --> 02:21:27.522]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:21:27.602 --> 02:21:27.922]  We're good.
[02:21:53.388 --> 02:21:56.472]  Your own personal Jesus
[02:22:09.129 --> 02:22:20.156]  Okay, once again, this is Bob Dacey substituting for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show on the GCN Network.
[02:22:21.057 --> 02:22:26.120]  This got off the phone a while ago with Sue from California and she was talking about something I don't know anything about.
[02:22:26.180 --> 02:22:27.861]  However, sounds very interesting.
[02:22:27.901 --> 02:22:29.642]  Sounds like something people need to look into.
[02:22:30.203 --> 02:22:34.666]  Something about spraying for apple moths with some bizarre chemical in Central California.
[02:22:35.126 --> 02:22:38.869]  I think she said Kimtrails911.com as a website.
[02:22:38.889 --> 02:22:39.849]  I hope I got that right.
[02:22:39.869 --> 02:22:40.890]  I hope I didn't screw that up.
[02:22:42.751 --> 02:22:43.512]  People need to look into that.
[02:22:43.532 --> 02:22:45.093]  They spray crud on us all the time.
[02:22:45.333 --> 02:22:47.314]  I don't know anything about this subject.
[02:22:47.374 --> 02:22:53.599]  However, it sounds like people over there need to look into it and spread this all over the place with factual information.
[02:22:54.619 --> 02:22:56.340]  Get some factual information.
[02:22:56.541 --> 02:22:59.943]  If a bunch of lawyers are trying to suppress it, you know there's probably something to it.
[02:23:00.783 --> 02:23:03.305]  Okay, we got Mike in St.
[02:23:03.365 --> 02:23:04.306]  Louis up next.
[02:23:04.406 --> 02:23:05.447]  Mike, are you still there?
[02:23:07.028 --> 02:23:07.188]  Hello?
[02:23:07.468 --> 02:23:08.329]  Mike, how are you doing?
[02:23:08.709 --> 02:23:09.430]  Pretty good, how are you doing?
[02:23:09.730 --> 02:23:10.651]  Oh, I'm doing alright.
[02:23:10.671 --> 02:23:12.992]  You're on the Alex Jones Show talking to two million people.
[02:23:13.012 --> 02:23:13.513]  How do you feel?
[02:23:15.414 --> 02:23:20.978]  My phone just bugged, but I just wanted to put an idea out there for the Ron Paul campaign.
[02:23:21.339 --> 02:23:24.101]  If anybody does blogging and stuff like that.
[02:23:24.121 --> 02:23:25.242]  Am I still on?
[02:23:25.482 --> 02:23:27.844]  Yeah, you're kind of breaking up a little bit, but go ahead.
[02:23:29.185 --> 02:23:29.505]  Are you there?
[02:23:30.282 --> 02:23:31.543]  Okay, yeah.
[02:23:31.843 --> 02:23:50.696]  I just wanted to say that, like, if people wanted to, to get out there and take their video cameras and do kind of like a blood drive thing, because, like, really, you know, it seems like him and Dennis Kucinich are the only people that don't really have, like, kind of blood money coming in from these big corporations, and I'm really trying to support Ron Paul, so, like, you know, veterans could get out there and, you know, do, like, video blogs, like, yeah, you know, we'll bleed for freedom and stuff like that.
[02:23:51.132 --> 02:23:51.332]  Yeah.
[02:23:51.932 --> 02:23:58.676]  And I had a question about promoting community organizing in really heavily polarized Republican areas.
[02:23:58.916 --> 02:24:06.700]  How can we promote basically just grassroots community organizing outside of the government to take care of our problems without being labeled communist?
[02:24:09.089 --> 02:24:09.950]  Man, I don't know.
[02:24:10.530 --> 02:24:11.691]  Boy, that's a big question.
[02:24:11.751 --> 02:24:15.374]  How can you promote grassroots stuff without being labeled communist?
[02:24:15.755 --> 02:24:21.379]  I think doing what the Ron Paul people are doing is a great example of that.
[02:24:21.419 --> 02:24:22.640]  I mean, if you go to RonPaul2008.com,
[02:24:24.740 --> 02:24:33.744]  And you get up with these meet-up groups they got all over the place and YouTube and MySpace and everything else stuff I'm not really all that familiar with.
[02:24:33.824 --> 02:24:42.488]  I mean they got it all over the place and how can you be accused of being a communist when what you talk about is the Constitution and the Bill of Rights all the time?
[02:24:42.938 --> 02:24:45.780]  Right, and we want a small federal government.
[02:24:46.420 --> 02:24:49.082]  Just local control of our communities.
[02:24:49.102 --> 02:24:50.642]  There's been a lot of bad stuff happen here.
[02:24:50.722 --> 02:24:56.706]  I hope I'm not messing up any of the debate, but with the No Child Left Behind Act, so many schools have gotten closed down.
[02:24:56.906 --> 02:24:58.147]  It's really hard on the communities.
[02:24:58.187 --> 02:25:02.529]  Kids spending two or three times as much time on the bus to get to and from school.
[02:25:02.549 --> 02:25:05.711]  It makes it really hard for the parents who are not earning that much money.
[02:25:05.971 --> 02:25:14.117]  You know, I'll tell you one thing for sure, and I think you just dropped off, so I'm going to let you go, but let me say this, Mike.
[02:25:16.819 --> 02:25:27.647]  There is no way that federal anything is the best way to do something, other than national defense and securing the borders, which they seem to have a problem with.
[02:25:27.687 --> 02:25:33.312]  They've turned national defense into national offense, international offense, and they won't secure the borders.
[02:25:34.480 --> 02:25:41.508]  The more the federal government gets involved in education, the dumber the end product gets, the worse the end product gets.
[02:25:42.349 --> 02:25:46.234]  The more the federal government gets involved in anything, the worse it gets.
[02:25:48.966 --> 02:25:52.127]  That local control is very, very, very important.
[02:25:52.147 --> 02:25:54.589]  You want to have local control of everything.
[02:25:54.629 --> 02:25:56.449]  You want to have local control of your police.
[02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:58.930]  You want to have local control of your schools.
[02:25:59.491 --> 02:26:05.834]  Everything you can, keep the federal government's nose out of it, because they screw up everything they touch.
[02:26:07.174 --> 02:26:12.296]  And again, the Constitution mirrors that.
[02:26:12.657 --> 02:26:14.817]  Look at the powers given to the federal government.
[02:26:14.837 --> 02:26:15.898]  They're few and defined.
[02:26:16.457 --> 02:26:35.612]  And they can't even get those right, yet your classic liberal, and I never have been able to understand liberals the way the modern day liberal is, the federal government screws everything up so bad that the solution is to give them more power and more money so they can screw it up even worse.
[02:26:37.532 --> 02:26:46.640]  So yeah, but as far as organizing for grassroots, hey, you want to organize for grassroots, just do whatever the Ron Paul people are doing because these people have got it together.
[02:26:47.461 --> 02:26:47.741]  Alright?
[02:26:48.582 --> 02:26:52.825]  Okay, we have Joe in Kansas up next.
[02:26:52.885 --> 02:26:55.508]  I think Joe was gone and Joe has returned.
[02:26:55.528 --> 02:26:56.228]  Joe, are you there?
[02:26:56.849 --> 02:26:57.589]  Yes, can you hear me?
[02:26:57.910 --> 02:26:58.670]  Yes sir, I can.
[02:26:59.371 --> 02:27:03.955]  Alright, I want to just say that I really like it when you are able to stand in for Alex.
[02:27:04.395 --> 02:27:05.076]  He needs a break.
[02:27:06.204 --> 02:27:07.785]  Well, that's good.
[02:27:07.825 --> 02:27:08.605]  I'm glad to hear that.
[02:27:09.606 --> 02:27:13.128]  He does need a break every once in a while, and I'm more than happy to do it.
[02:27:13.888 --> 02:27:16.669]  And, you know, speaking of a break, we're up against a break.
[02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:22.232]  So, Joe, if you'll hang on for a few minutes, we'll come back to you after this break.
[02:27:22.573 --> 02:27:27.135]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on Genesis Radio Network.
[02:27:35.875 --> 02:27:38.883]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.806 --> 02:27:42.534]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.879 --> 02:27:47.600]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[02:27:47.981 --> 02:27:51.343]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.

[02:28:44.894 --> 02:28:47.835]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:28:47.995 --> 02:28:53.198]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:28:53.518 --> 02:28:58.800]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:00.321]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:29:00.701 --> 02:29:09.788]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[02:29:45.425 --> 02:29:46.566]  I'm Dr. Bill Diggle, M.D.
[02:29:46.586 --> 02:29:48.969]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:29:49.109 --> 02:29:52.112]  Allison's Natural Antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:29:52.172 --> 02:29:52.832]  is the real thing.
[02:29:52.913 --> 02:29:59.739]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:00.961]  We're good to go.

[02:30:35.527 --> 02:30:36.127]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[02:30:36.207 --> 02:30:38.327]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:30:38.367 --> 02:30:39.168]  It is a big idea!
[02:30:48.698 --> 02:30:49.759]  A new world order!
[02:30:54.103 --> 02:30:59.709]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:30:59.969 --> 02:31:02.572]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:31:03.192 --> 02:31:06.676]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:31:07.616 --> 02:31:10.079]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:31:10.948 --> 02:31:18.439]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:31:25.111 --> 02:31:30.193]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:31:31.594 --> 02:31:35.736]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:31:35.956 --> 02:31:43.440]  America is making great progress toward a world where only an educated form of the people can stop them in their tracks.
[02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:45.341]  Shut up, you.
[02:31:46.401 --> 02:31:49.444]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[02:31:50.124 --> 02:31:53.587]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[02:31:54.628 --> 02:31:58.131]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain.
[02:31:58.972 --> 02:32:03.195]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[02:32:03.215 --> 02:32:10.762]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[02:32:16.155 --> 02:32:18.356]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[02:32:18.376 --> 02:32:21.138]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[02:32:21.418 --> 02:32:22.538]  Most people have no idea.
[02:32:22.558 --> 02:32:23.339]  They're not after money.
[02:32:23.379 --> 02:32:24.459]  They have all the money they need.
[02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:25.420]  They're after power.
[02:32:26.421 --> 02:32:29.162]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[02:32:30.162 --> 02:32:31.443]  A full-on plane in Munich.
[02:32:31.483 --> 02:32:32.764]  They interrogate him in four hours.
[02:32:32.784 --> 02:32:33.724]  Some shots were fired.
[02:32:33.744 --> 02:32:36.066]  They need you to move off the province.
[02:32:36.106 --> 02:32:39.708]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:32:44.597 --> 02:32:47.099]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:32:47.399 --> 02:32:48.620]  You have been warned.
[02:32:55.044 --> 02:33:03.409]  Alright, you have been warned and this is Bob Dacey back for Alex Jones in the third hour of the Alex Jones Show on October the 12th, 2007.
[02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:07.952]  And again, go to InfoWars.com and pre-order Endgame.
[02:33:07.992 --> 02:33:08.712]  That's what you gotta do.
[02:33:09.152 --> 02:33:10.093]  That's all there is to it.
[02:33:10.635 --> 02:33:18.278]  You know, these people in here, Al, I'm looking at some of his employees running around here, and they're all busy doing stuff, and they got to get paid.
[02:33:18.338 --> 02:33:33.424]  And Deb Gummett, this is a money-making enterprise for Alex, because I admire the heck out of him for being able to actually run an operation, and make money, and provide for his family, and pay a payroll, and tell the truth all at the same time.
[02:33:33.504 --> 02:33:37.966]  I mean, gosh, you know, people in the mainstream media, they do the same thing, except they're lying.
[02:33:38.106 --> 02:33:39.627]  So there's, you know, it's a big difference here.
[02:33:40.256 --> 02:33:49.878]  You know, so support Alex, go to Infowars.com, pre-order in-game, you know, order some of his other stuff too.
[02:33:49.898 --> 02:33:56.260]  You've got to get with the program here and support Alex because this guy is tenacious.
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:34:00.821]  I have never met anybody as tenacious as Alex Jones.
[02:34:01.201 --> 02:34:02.081]  He's like a bulldog.
[02:34:02.121 --> 02:34:02.801]  He latches on.
[02:34:02.821 --> 02:34:05.242]  He never, ever, ever gives up.
[02:34:06.033 --> 02:34:11.218]  Okay, before the break, I believe, let's see if I can remember, I think we're talking to Joe in Kansas.
[02:34:11.258 --> 02:34:12.158]  Joe, are you still there?
[02:34:12.819 --> 02:34:13.279]  Yes, I am.
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:14.280]  Okay, Joe.
[02:34:14.721 --> 02:34:16.842]  Those commercial breaks, they just come up on you, you know?
[02:34:16.862 --> 02:34:20.145]  And they won't go away, so we've got to do that.
[02:34:20.185 --> 02:34:23.588]  What else did you have to contribute to the Alex Jones Show?
[02:34:24.229 --> 02:34:27.472]  I wanted to throw a few things out, and you can make with them if you will.
[02:34:28.653 --> 02:34:32.916]  One, I was hoping to hear an update on your TV show being put online.
[02:34:32.936 --> 02:34:33.497]  Okay.
[02:34:34.119 --> 02:34:54.911]  Another, there is a, I guess a researcher, his name is E. Michael Jones, you can probably find him on the internet under that, and he's done some presentations on what he would call ethnic cleansing, like what's happening in big cities where you just look around and you see old buildings and messed up cars and poor people living.
[02:34:55.379 --> 02:35:04.087]  And he says, this is what it looks like in Somalia when ethnic cleansing, so-called, has been underway, in an obvious way.
[02:35:04.107 --> 02:35:20.983]  Another point, that Vicente Fox, that situation where he was talking about his and Bush's agreement, that was posted at my office, which is good, because there are a lot of kind of Republican zealots there.
[02:35:21.431 --> 02:35:22.131]  Yeah, that's an old one.
[02:35:22.151 --> 02:35:24.231]  That's been out for quite some time now.
[02:35:24.352 --> 02:35:27.672]  It's a very good overview from Carter to Bush or Clinton or whatever.
[02:35:27.772 --> 02:35:29.992]  Yeah, that's got the CFR list in the back of it.
[02:35:50.808 --> 02:35:57.930]  I guess I'd like to let people know if they're in Kansas and they want to do political activism on the same line as Ron Paul is doing for the presidential race.
[02:36:10.490 --> 02:36:15.893]  We're trying to do that in the Reform Party of Kansas, and our website is votekansas.org.
[02:36:15.933 --> 02:36:20.035]  You can sign up or contact us.
[02:36:20.515 --> 02:36:21.996]  Okay, Joe, thank you very much for the call.
[02:36:22.016 --> 02:36:27.019]  I appreciate that, and I'm going to comment on some of what you said and blow off some of it, because I forgot what it was already.
[02:36:27.479 --> 02:36:31.921]  By the way, votekansas.org has a section devoted to me.
[02:36:32.141 --> 02:36:33.702]  I had nothing to do with it.
[02:36:33.722 --> 02:36:34.482]  They stuck it up there.
[02:36:34.522 --> 02:36:38.965]  There's a Bob Dacey section on votekansas.org, which has a lot of my
[02:36:40.074 --> 02:36:40.955]  Yes, we are.
[02:37:06.348 --> 02:37:06.568]  I think so.
[02:37:37.193 --> 02:37:37.613]  I don't think so.
[02:37:57.749 --> 02:37:58.190]  Yes, we are.
[02:38:22.468 --> 02:38:24.269]  I guess you can Google it.
[02:38:24.289 --> 02:38:25.290]  I don't know anything about it.
[02:38:26.531 --> 02:38:28.052]  Alright, so much for that.
[02:38:28.472 --> 02:38:32.055]  Next caller we have is Lee in Texas.
[02:38:32.215 --> 02:38:33.115]  Lee, are you still there?
[02:38:35.257 --> 02:38:42.622]  I wanted to encourage everyone in the listening audience to do an online search for Vigilant Shield.
[02:38:43.042 --> 02:38:49.867]  It's a government drill that is going to be taking place October 14th through October 20th.
[02:38:52.818 --> 02:38:55.300]  And what exactly is Vigilant Shield?
[02:38:55.380 --> 02:39:16.037]  You know, the reason he says this, I'm assuming, is because every time something nefarious goes down, like September 11th, or such things as that, or the government always just happens to be coincidentally running a drill, practicing the very same thing, you know, it's one of those maybe-so-maybe-not deals.
[02:39:16.117 --> 02:39:17.738]  But what is Vigilant Shield?
[02:39:19.358 --> 02:39:23.039]  Well, I mean, there's a lot of groups involved with it.
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:33.484]  I don't have time on the air to really go into in-depth, but I can also give a plug for an operation called Noble Resolve.
[02:39:35.464 --> 02:39:47.149]  It involves a lot of different organizations, and from what I have in front of me, I'll read this real quick, USJFCOM,
[02:39:47.958 --> 02:39:54.041]  It's for the Department of Homeland Security's scenario for an unaccounted for loose 10 kiloton nuclear weapon.
[02:39:54.061 --> 02:39:55.722]  I don't know, what do they call that?
[02:39:55.742 --> 02:39:56.403]  A broken arrow?
[02:39:57.443 --> 02:39:58.004]  Something like that?
[02:39:59.324 --> 02:40:01.145]  Wasn't there a movie about that with John Travolta?
[02:40:01.966 --> 02:40:02.666]  I'm not sure.
[02:40:02.686 --> 02:40:04.287]  I think there was.
[02:40:05.108 --> 02:40:11.471]  This thing cranked up April 2007 and will be, will continue over the next two years.
[02:40:12.432 --> 02:40:12.572]  Yeah.
[02:40:12.592 --> 02:40:16.154]  And there's a ton of organizations involved with this.
[02:40:17.917 --> 02:40:24.383]  You know, FEMA, Homeland Security, a lot of different states, even multinationals.
[02:40:24.543 --> 02:40:29.388]  You're saying like, just look out and duck or hold on to your horses or what?
[02:40:29.768 --> 02:40:33.672]  I mean, you know, they're always running drills.
[02:40:33.852 --> 02:40:34.713]  They're always running drills.
[02:40:35.013 --> 02:40:38.756]  And unfortunately, you know, Lee is right.
[02:40:38.937 --> 02:40:40.278]  They do tend to run drills.
[02:40:41.067 --> 02:40:41.988]  When bad things happen.
[02:40:42.668 --> 02:40:56.897]  I mean, they were running drills in England when the bombings went off in the tube stations, and the drills were exactly the same time, exactly the same scenario, and exactly the same locations as the actual bombings, which is like, you know, an impossible coincidence.
[02:40:57.357 --> 02:41:01.700]  September 11th, they were running drills about a hijacked aircraft in the United States.
[02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:05.622]  I mean, drills is a bad thing.
[02:41:05.862 --> 02:41:08.044]  It's like a harbinger of, oh, you better look out.
[02:41:08.264 --> 02:41:10.005]  But, you know, you can't
[02:41:11.044 --> 02:41:13.085]  You can't nail him down because it hadn't happened yet.
[02:41:13.805 --> 02:41:15.246]  Okay, Lee, thank you very much for the call.
[02:41:15.266 --> 02:41:15.966]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:16.947 --> 02:41:19.088]  Alright, we're going to go to David in Arizona.
[02:41:19.128 --> 02:41:21.169]  By the way, before I go to David, I want to put out the number again.
[02:41:21.229 --> 02:41:21.429]  It's 1-800-259-9231.
[02:41:21.489 --> 02:41:26.011]  That's 1-800-259-9231 if you want to try to get into the Alex Jones Show and pick a few topics around.
[02:41:26.031 --> 02:41:27.412]  So right now, we've got David in Arizona.
[02:41:27.432 --> 02:41:28.592]  David, are you there?
[02:41:37.541 --> 02:41:38.682]  Yeah, can you hear me okay?
[02:41:39.263 --> 02:41:39.823]  I can hear you.
[02:41:39.863 --> 02:41:41.845]  That means 2 million people can hear you too.
[02:41:41.925 --> 02:41:42.426]  Are you nervous?
[02:41:43.006 --> 02:41:44.487]  Oh, I wish it was 20 million.
[02:41:45.228 --> 02:41:47.030]  I do too, because I can't see any of them.
[02:41:47.050 --> 02:41:49.352]  So as far as I'm concerned, I'm sitting in a room here all by myself.
[02:41:49.372 --> 02:41:50.853]  All right.
[02:41:50.913 --> 02:41:54.116]  Well, I was just watching the news at noon here in Tucson, Arizona.
[02:41:54.897 --> 02:41:59.561]  And that girl that choked herself about a week or two ago at the Phoenix airport.
[02:41:59.641 --> 02:42:00.402]  With the handcuffs?
[02:42:00.962 --> 02:42:01.202]  Yeah.
[02:42:01.403 --> 02:42:02.183]  Yeah, with the handcuffs.
[02:42:02.203 --> 02:42:03.445]  Her name was Carol Gottbaum.
[02:42:03.645 --> 02:42:03.825]  Yeah.
[02:42:04.557 --> 02:42:15.403]  Well, they said on the news, they said that the husband put out a tip line on the TV channels and the radio, you know, to call in a tip to find out information because he's trying to get to the bottom of it.
[02:42:15.603 --> 02:42:15.924]  Right.
[02:42:16.884 --> 02:42:26.750]  And, you know, that was well enough, but then the weird part, I've never heard of this in my life, the thieves police put out a public service announcement and they said, do not call the tip line.
[02:42:28.131 --> 02:42:28.531]  Really?
[02:42:29.271 --> 02:42:29.652]  Really.
[02:42:29.792 --> 02:42:30.452]  I've never heard of it.
[02:42:30.492 --> 02:42:31.993]  Have you ever heard of that in your lifetime?
[02:42:32.713 --> 02:42:33.694]  Let me get this straight.
[02:42:34.739 --> 02:42:52.010]  The police put out a deal not to call the tip line to give information about what might have happened to Carol Gottbaum when she was taken away from the airport in handcuffs and then a few minutes later she's dead because the handcuffs got tangled around her neck, right?
[02:42:52.891 --> 02:42:53.751]  That was on the news.
[02:42:54.072 --> 02:42:54.912]  That's the way they put it.
[02:42:57.554 --> 02:43:02.457]  Okay, for all you guys out there, if you have any handcuffs available, what you do, see this is what you do.
[02:43:03.405 --> 02:43:09.109]  You get your handcuffs, and you put your hands behind your back, and then you lock your handcuffs behind your back.
[02:43:09.730 --> 02:43:11.951]  Now you just try to put those things around your neck!
[02:43:12.011 --> 02:43:12.632]  Just try!
[02:43:14.213 --> 02:43:15.033]  Just try!
[02:43:15.093 --> 02:43:16.895]  You know, the human body doesn't work that way.
[02:43:17.635 --> 02:43:20.998]  I'm sorry, it just doesn't work that way.
[02:43:21.738 --> 02:43:24.120]  And there's something really, really rotten about that.
[02:43:24.220 --> 02:43:25.321]  I don't know what it is.
[02:43:25.581 --> 02:43:26.902]  I'm not claiming anything.
[02:43:26.982 --> 02:43:29.604]  All I'm saying is that it doesn't pass the smell test.
[02:43:30.490 --> 02:43:36.595]  And if this guy is trying to get information off the tip line, why would the police want to stop tips?
[02:43:37.296 --> 02:43:40.178]  I mean, come on, we're supposed to get to the bottom of how this happened, right?
[02:43:40.818 --> 02:43:41.179]  Right.
[02:43:41.599 --> 02:43:41.959]  Right.
[02:43:42.299 --> 02:43:44.101]  So, wow, that's interesting.
[02:43:44.601 --> 02:43:50.426]  Yeah, that story is on the desk here somewhere about how this woman was distraught she was going somewhere and
[02:43:51.354 --> 02:44:02.798]  I've seen the airport video where she was kind of agitated and they came over and got her and escorted her out and next thing you know she's dead.
[02:44:03.298 --> 02:44:06.559]  And they made up this cockamamie excuse.
[02:44:06.599 --> 02:44:09.500]  How do you get your handcuffs to strangle you when they're back?
[02:44:09.780 --> 02:44:11.440]  I think they were behind her back.
[02:44:11.480 --> 02:44:15.521]  She was handcuffed with the handcuffs behind her back and I think she was also shackled to a bench.
[02:44:17.322 --> 02:44:17.902]  Go figure.
[02:44:18.022 --> 02:44:19.883]  Man, she must be a contortionist or something.
[02:44:21.320 --> 02:44:24.882]  Man, you know, the rubber band lady or something.
[02:44:25.322 --> 02:44:26.562]  There's something really bad about that.
[02:44:26.602 --> 02:44:30.044]  And if the cops are trying to suppress the information, that's even worse.
[02:44:30.064 --> 02:44:31.344]  You know?
[02:44:32.165 --> 02:44:34.226]  Okay, David, what else you got to say?
[02:44:34.706 --> 02:44:35.566]  Well, one more thing.
[02:44:35.986 --> 02:44:40.508]  We've got a lot of mountain lions or cougars or pumas, whatever you call them here in Tucson.
[02:44:41.889 --> 02:44:45.471]  And I don't know, are you familiar with what you do if you encounter one when you're walking on a trail?
[02:44:45.511 --> 02:44:48.572]  What's the best thing to do for you to keep yourself safe?
[02:44:49.421 --> 02:44:50.901]  Best thing to do to keep yourself safe?
[02:44:51.401 --> 02:44:52.602]  No, I'm not familiar.
[02:44:52.642 --> 02:44:53.702]  I'd probably shoot him.
[02:44:53.722 --> 02:44:56.722]  I don't know, but I'd probably get in trouble for endangered species something or other.
[02:44:56.842 --> 02:44:58.023]  Oh yeah, you sure would.
[02:44:58.063 --> 02:45:07.344]  But no, if you didn't have a gun and you had to keep yourself safe, they say the best thing to do is what you instead of crouching down or running away, he'll just come and attack you and kill you.
[02:45:07.724 --> 02:45:07.824]  Yeah?
[02:45:07.844 --> 02:45:16.406]  What you do is just stand up and you put your hands up like you're stretching as far as you can and you wave your arms and you make yourself really big and you scream loud and you go, roar!
[02:45:16.446 --> 02:45:16.826]  Like a bear.
[02:45:18.271 --> 02:45:23.152]  I don't know if you or Alex know this, but it was just in a little blurb in the newspaper a month or two ago.
[02:45:46.204 --> 02:45:54.389]  Kansas Governor Catherine Sebelius, she went to Bilderberg in, I guess it was July.
[02:45:54.569 --> 02:45:59.452]  Well, I guess that was, was that, was that when the same time Rick Perry went?
[02:45:59.532 --> 02:46:00.512]  Our governor in Texas?
[02:46:00.552 --> 02:46:03.854]  Or was that a different, I guess it had to have been because they only meet, yeah, it must have been.
[02:46:04.154 --> 02:46:10.818]  Same time and nobody, really I never heard it discussed and she charged several thousand dollars to Kansas taxpayers.
[02:46:11.934 --> 02:46:19.237]  Well now, our governor claims that all the money he went, when he went to Goldberg, came out of his campaign finance account or something like that.
[02:46:19.257 --> 02:46:22.298]  But I don't really care where the money came from because it's a minor thing.
[02:46:22.338 --> 02:46:34.963]  What's major is you've got these government officials going over to Istanbul, Turkey and kissing the robes of the super elitist, globalist filth that are trying to destroy this whole world.
[02:46:35.043 --> 02:46:38.884]  So, you know, that's the big news, not how much the taxpayer spends or not.
[02:46:41.047 --> 02:46:51.136]  Most people don't know and she's, you know, poor of the illegal aliens and she's, uh, obviously they got her because she can be, uh, get the, uh, NAFTA highway in.
[02:46:52.557 --> 02:46:55.279]  So maybe Kansas voters ought to know about that.
[02:46:55.480 --> 02:46:57.121]  Well, yeah, I think they should.
[02:46:57.481 --> 02:46:58.722]  Thank you for that call.
[02:46:58.742 --> 02:46:59.383]  I appreciate that.
[02:46:59.403 --> 02:47:03.406]  You know, it's funny that he's talking about that, that he talked about illegal immigration.
[02:47:03.446 --> 02:47:08.791]  I've got an article here from the American Statesman, uh, on the topic of immigration and employment.
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:21.223]  It was put on the Statesman yesterday on the 11th, written by a Spencer Sue from the Washington Post, says that a judge calls halt to crackdown on immigrants.
[02:47:22.343 --> 02:47:28.385]  Washington, a federal judge barred the Bush administration Wednesday from beginning a planned crackdown on U.S.
[02:47:28.465 --> 02:47:35.127]  firms that hire illegal immigrants, writing that it could have a staggering impact on law-abiding workers and companies.
[02:47:36.014 --> 02:47:36.174]  U.S.
[02:47:36.274 --> 02:47:51.026]  District Judge Charles Breyer of San Francisco granted a preliminary injunction against President Bush's plan to pressure employers, starting this fall, to fire millions of workers whose names don't match their social security numbers.
[02:47:51.947 --> 02:48:01.855]  But the new ruling, sought by major American labor, business, and farm organizations, highlighted the chasm that the issue has opened between the Republican Party and its traditional business allies.
[02:48:03.076 --> 02:48:04.257]  So, you got
[02:48:05.146 --> 02:48:06.787]  A judge, try it.
[02:48:07.027 --> 02:48:11.371]  Of course this program is a bunch of BS anyway because President Bush doesn't really want to do this.
[02:48:11.411 --> 02:48:13.332]  This is all window dressing, okay?
[02:48:13.893 --> 02:48:18.596]  You know, you fire a few illegal aliens and the American people think, oh, they're doing something about it.
[02:48:18.656 --> 02:48:19.837]  Well, they're not doing anything about it.
[02:48:19.877 --> 02:48:22.159]  This is all window dressing.
[02:48:22.939 --> 02:48:28.323]  But anyway, when we get back, we'll probably continue on with this frame of thought.
[02:48:28.363 --> 02:48:32.206]  This is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:48:44.529 --> 02:48:45.930]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:45.950 --> 02:48:48.052]  A new world order.
[02:48:48.753 --> 02:48:52.796]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:52.896 --> 02:48:55.419]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:48:55.619 --> 02:48:58.762]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:48:59.262 --> 02:49:01.665]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:02.430 --> 02:49:09.756]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:12.791 --> 02:49:17.773]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:18.233 --> 02:49:21.735]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:22.095 --> 02:49:24.616]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:24.656 --> 02:49:25.817]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:25.837 --> 02:49:26.597]  They're not after money.
[02:49:26.617 --> 02:49:27.677]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:27.897 --> 02:49:28.658]  They're after power.
[02:49:28.878 --> 02:49:29.718]  That's what they're after.

[02:51:00.979 --> 02:51:04.241]  Our Founding Fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.

[02:51:56.431 --> 02:51:57.832]  Okay, Bob Dacey, back.
[02:51:58.092 --> 02:52:01.073]  Last segment of the Alex Jones Show here on October 12, 2007.
[02:52:01.753 --> 02:52:11.897]  And lest I forget, because I tend to forget before I take Jim in Oregon, I'm going to remind you that this show streams 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:52:13.186 --> 02:52:24.712]  So as soon as this show is over, you can go to Infowars.com and click on the Listen Live Now button and you can listen to Bob Dacey seven more times before tomorrow, before Monday.
[02:52:24.912 --> 02:52:37.379]  I don't know how many times we're going to play it over the weekend or whatever, but you can listen to me until the cows come home, anytime you want to, up until Monday at 11 o'clock when you can listen to me again live and then you can go it over again and again and again.
[02:52:37.399 --> 02:52:40.881]  Alex has a massive communications array here.
[02:52:41.767 --> 02:52:45.508]  In the Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines.
[02:52:45.728 --> 02:52:47.349]  Okay, we have Jim in Oregon.
[02:52:47.409 --> 02:52:48.729]  Jim, what do you have on your mind?
[02:52:49.510 --> 02:52:52.070]  I'd like to correct the previous caller.
[02:52:52.291 --> 02:52:54.851]  The exercise he was referring to was Top Off 4.
[02:52:55.312 --> 02:53:00.533]  It's going to be happening in Guam, Portland and Phoenix, 15th through the 19th.
[02:53:01.474 --> 02:53:08.516]  And at least in Portland, they're intending to simulate the detonation of a dirty bomb on the Steel Bridge.
[02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:09.632]  No, they are.
[02:53:09.672 --> 02:53:11.293]  It's right near downtown Portland.
[02:53:11.313 --> 02:53:14.154]  You ought to call Zacharias Moussalian and put him over there.
[02:53:14.354 --> 02:53:17.955]  Or Jose Padilla and get his expertise on how to do that.
[02:53:18.215 --> 02:53:22.797]  The guy that hadn't jailed forever without any constitutional rights.
[02:53:22.817 --> 02:53:23.237]  That guy.
[02:53:23.637 --> 02:53:23.897]  Right.
[02:53:24.418 --> 02:53:28.399]  My recommendation would be just to steer clear of the area if you had that option.
[02:53:28.899 --> 02:53:31.700]  At least the first part of next week.
[02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:37.443]  They're going to do whatever they want to do, but I don't want to get paranoid based on what might happen.
[02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:40.591]  Well, the traffic's going to be a mess.
[02:53:41.412 --> 02:53:45.954]  And that alone is enough to steer clear of the area.
[02:53:46.075 --> 02:53:47.095]  Yeah, that's not a bad idea.
[02:53:47.155 --> 02:53:48.896]  Okay, Jim, thank you very much for the call.
[02:53:49.116 --> 02:53:49.897]  Okay, last caller.
[02:53:49.917 --> 02:53:51.798]  We've got Don in Texas.
[02:53:51.858 --> 02:53:52.519]  Don, are you there?
[02:53:52.539 --> 02:53:53.679]  Oh, hi there.
[02:53:53.719 --> 02:53:54.140]  Hi there.
[02:53:54.180 --> 02:53:55.741]  Yeah.
[02:53:56.321 --> 02:53:59.483]  Yeah, well, I just want to say something.
[02:53:59.783 --> 02:54:01.424]  I take the new American, by the way.
[02:54:01.464 --> 02:54:01.725]  Good.
[02:54:01.745 --> 02:54:02.805]  You should.
[02:54:02.885 --> 02:54:03.526]  Everybody should.
[02:54:03.726 --> 02:54:04.987]  American Free Press.
[02:54:05.047 --> 02:54:06.788]  I've been having that for a long time.
[02:54:08.598 --> 02:54:13.619]  I mean, I'm not a fanatic, but a lot of the things that are going on seem to be coordinated.
[02:54:13.679 --> 02:54:14.539]  The toll roads.
[02:54:14.619 --> 02:54:15.280]  Of course they are!
[02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:17.620]  The invasion of Mexicans.
[02:54:17.860 --> 02:54:19.000]  Absolutely, it's all coordinated.
[02:54:19.060 --> 02:54:32.563]  And they're all scripted by people that tell them, here's the little speech you give, just like when they teach a salesman to give a little scripted, you know, we've been racist controlled, and this, that, and the other.
[02:54:33.063 --> 02:54:35.864]  And one of the things I was going to talk about is, like in the first Iraq War,
[02:54:36.840 --> 02:54:48.503]  You know they had, you've probably heard about it, the Trench of Death, you know the Mile of Death is one thing, but they had the trench where they, it's like they did the Egyptians where they put 800 or so in a trench and, you know, killed them.
[02:54:49.103 --> 02:54:50.524]  All right.
[02:54:50.564 --> 02:54:51.204]  You've heard of that?
[02:54:51.484 --> 02:54:55.365]  I've heard of several massacres that occurred in the First World War.
[02:54:55.565 --> 02:55:03.187]  Alex had someone on that, you know, well it's been numerous times it's been explained, they started a riot in Egypt
[02:55:03.712 --> 02:55:11.118]  Over that when they found out, and that was not the only time they did it in Egypt, you know, where the Israelis would, you know, we say, we take no prisoners.
[02:55:11.438 --> 02:55:12.158]  That's what they say.
[02:55:12.939 --> 02:55:16.462]  And, but there was this, uh, a huge amount of people at maybe 20,000.
[02:55:17.442 --> 02:55:28.611]  I can't believe that, but it may be true where it's too astronomical to believe where they had bulldozers make a huge, you know, when the Iraqi guys surrendered, you know, when on the mile of death, you heard it.
[02:55:28.631 --> 02:55:29.771]  You remember that maybe vaguely?
[02:55:30.132 --> 02:55:30.312]  Yeah.
[02:55:30.828 --> 02:55:33.590]  And have you ever heard of Janet Karpinski?
[02:55:36.732 --> 02:55:40.014]  I tell you what, if you call me back Monday, we'll talk about this.
[02:55:40.034 --> 02:55:41.014]  We're running out of time.
[02:55:41.174 --> 02:55:44.236]  I know there was a lot of atrocities in Iraq, the first Gulf War.
[02:55:44.736 --> 02:55:48.719]  One of them was involved General Barry McCaffrey who slaughtered a bunch of people after the thing was over.
[02:55:49.119 --> 02:55:50.780]  That's well documented by Seymour Hersh.
[02:55:51.380 --> 02:55:53.362]  I tell you what, this is Bob Dacey.
[02:55:53.942 --> 02:55:56.323]  I'll be here for Alex for the next couple of days.
[02:55:56.343 --> 02:55:59.645]  Once again, you can listen to this show immediately on Infowars.com.
[02:56:01.208 --> 02:56:09.596]  And Alex is going to be back on Wednesday and until then you're just going to have to put up with me and I enjoy the heck out of doing this because it's not every day you get to talk to two million people.
[02:56:10.056 --> 02:56:14.420]  So this is Bob Dacey for Alex Jones on the GCN Communications Network.
[02:56:14.780 --> 02:56:15.561]  Get involved.
[02:56:15.861 --> 02:56:16.782]  Fight the New World Order.
[02:56:23.883 --> 02:56:28.497]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:56:28.517 --> 02:56:28.657]  Hello!
