[00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:06.525]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:07.805]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:07.845 --> 00:00:08.986]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:09.927]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:09.967 --> 00:00:11.508]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:47.452]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.913 --> 00:00:53.417]  Hello, my friends listening across the country and across the planet, around the planet.
[00:00:53.717 --> 00:00:55.398]  It is Sunday, October 7, 2007.
[00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.003]  We're going to be here for the next two hours, roughly.
[00:01:03.584 --> 00:01:08.367]  We're going to take quite a few phone calls today at 877-590-5525.
[00:01:08.387 --> 00:01:19.835]  Or locally, if you're listening to us off the station we broadcast out of, or if this transmission originates from, use radio 590 KLBJ.
[00:01:20.095 --> 00:01:22.697]  You can call 836-0590.
[00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.102]  I'm going to attempt to be calm today and just go over the news and information that I have in front of me.
[00:01:31.703 --> 00:01:33.284]  And a lot of it is very, very important.
[00:01:34.458 --> 00:01:43.042]  I am creating artificial life, declares US gene pioneer, with a Nobel Prize winning team that he's working with.
[00:01:43.062 --> 00:02:00.812]  It's Craig Vintner, the controversial DNA researcher involved in the race to decipher the human genetic code, has built a synthetic chromosome out of laboratory chemicals, and is poised to announce the creation of the first new artificial life form on Earth.
[00:02:00.952 --> 00:02:01.592]  And if you think
[00:02:02.216 --> 00:02:04.397]  This new announcement will be the first time they've done it.
[00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:10.859]  I've got oceanfront property in Arizona, and from my front porch, we can see the sea.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.621]  As I said last week, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:20.183]  They have at least 30 years of suppressed technology, and they declassified much of that in the past.
[00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:22.144]  That is, previous things that were secret.
[00:02:23.084 --> 00:02:27.626]  And they're now just making more and more announcements to the public, who doesn't seem to care.
[00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:30.747]  They're busy running around drooling in their football jerseys.
[00:02:32.061 --> 00:02:37.063]  Also, National Guard troops are being denied benefits after longest deployment of Iraq war.
[00:02:37.843 --> 00:02:41.285]  And that's out of WCSH Portland News.
[00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:44.406]  NBC will be breaking that down.
[00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:49.328]  I have a story here in front of me.
[00:02:49.508 --> 00:02:53.930]  More signs that the Bush people are preparing for President Hillary Clinton.
[00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:07.256]  They're already appointing former Clinton officials to the Defense Department and other key positions in preparation for that transfer of power, so there's not a real election going outside of Ron Paul.
[00:03:07.796 --> 00:03:19.202]  It's staged, both parties are in bed together, and the sooner you stop being children, and the sooner you start realizing that and then actually verifying that, don't believe me, go find out how bad it is, please.
[00:03:19.782 --> 00:03:22.684]  Don't just say you heard that, no, please, go look into it.
[00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:25.298]  And then you'll know how dire the straits are that we face.
[00:03:29.821 --> 00:03:41.588]  I saw something very depressing about two hours ago, and I'm going to play some of this, not all of it, it goes on for ten minutes, or at least a few minutes, so we can comment and review it.
[00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.154]  Stewart tells psychopathic MSNBC host, your book is a recipe for sadness.
[00:03:50.894 --> 00:03:52.175]  Now that's what to outlaw
[00:03:53.251 --> 00:04:03.594]  Journalism.com had to say about it, but I agree with what they wrote and what they said here, and it's a nice preface for some of the things I want to say about it.
[00:04:03.614 --> 00:04:21.639]  The driving here, I had hundreds of examples and ideas and indicators of a society in massive decline, a mass mental illness of society, going through my mind and just trying to pick a few examples
[00:04:22.372 --> 00:04:23.452]  That's really the problem.
[00:04:24.372 --> 00:04:29.894]  And by the way, I'm not up on some sardonic high horse here saying that I'm good.
[00:04:30.774 --> 00:04:42.516]  I'm quite pathetic and decadent and ignorant and malformed mentally myself, but a mental giant compared to most in this mutated current age that we're in.
[00:04:43.376 --> 00:04:45.777]  And that is the painful thing.
[00:04:48.709 --> 00:05:11.855]  Chris Matthews of Hardball sits up there giggling and snorting like a tart or trollop that he is and saying that basically lying is good and lying is American and that everything in our lives is a lie and that we just need to, like peacocks, put out these big displays and that that's all that matters.
[00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:16.396]  Well, you may want to liken yourself to a peacock, buddy.
[00:05:17.682 --> 00:05:18.243]  But not me.
[00:05:18.463 --> 00:05:21.406]  I'm about being honorable to my friends and family.
[00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:23.848]  I'm about being substantive.
[00:05:23.868 --> 00:05:25.629]  I'm about being true.
[00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:30.674]  And I mean true to those I care about, true to my enemies, to defeat them.
[00:05:31.715 --> 00:05:40.183]  And to see the establishment selling fraud and selling lies in the open marketplace.
[00:05:41.004 --> 00:05:43.386]  Well, they already sold us that torture of children is good.
[00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:46.382]  In front of their parents, so what's next?
[00:05:46.442 --> 00:05:48.384]  Well, lying is now good.
[00:05:49.464 --> 00:05:51.305]  And I tell you what, we've got time now.
[00:05:51.325 --> 00:05:56.769]  I'm going to play just a minute or two of this and then we're going to come back and I'm going to comment on this after the break.
[00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.651]  But you're really missing it if you don't see the video.
[00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:05.254]  There's a link to it up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:06:06.255 --> 00:06:09.717]  That's the second link on OutlawJournalism.com.
[00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.759]  Uh, easier place to find it.
[00:06:12.279 --> 00:06:16.541]  But, uh, Stuart Tells Psychopathic MSNBC Host, your book is a recipe for sadness.
[00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:26.263]  So let's just listen to this, and many of you have already got the mental disease of, uh, ninnying, uh, decadent, uh, sociopathic, uh, behavior.
[00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.143]  Mass psychosis.
[00:06:27.183 --> 00:06:29.484]  So you won't even understand why this is a big deal.
[00:06:29.504 --> 00:06:33.225]  You'll be snickering and agreeing, uh, in an effeminate way.
[00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:34.085]  Uh, here it is.
[00:06:34.685 --> 00:06:39.226]  What about my guest tonight?
[00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:46.778]  The host of MSNBC's Hardball and NBC's The Chris Matthews Show, his new book is called Life's a Campaign.
[00:06:47.278 --> 00:06:50.419]  Politics is talking about friendship, rivalry, reputation and success.
[00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:52.240]  Please welcome back to the show, Chris Matthews!
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:07:02.403]  Welcome back to the show!
[00:07:02.443 --> 00:07:03.844]  How's it going?
[00:07:04.084 --> 00:07:04.444]  It's great.
[00:07:05.004 --> 00:07:05.885]  Life's a Campaign.
[00:07:06.625 --> 00:07:09.106]  Now if I read this correctly, and I believe I read this book correctly,
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:19.964]  What you are saying is, people can use what politicians do in political campaigns to help their lives.
[00:07:20.364 --> 00:07:21.525]  Yeah!
[00:07:22.265 --> 00:07:23.105]  It's irony, isn't it?
[00:07:23.225 --> 00:07:24.366]  It strikes me as fundamentally wrong.
[00:07:26.006 --> 00:07:30.168]  It strikes me as a self-hurt book, if you will.
[00:07:30.788 --> 00:07:33.509]  Aren't campaigns fundamentally contrivances?
[00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:37.491]  Yeah, campaigns can be, but the way politicians get to the top
[00:07:38.722 --> 00:07:39.482]  Is the real thing.
[00:07:39.502 --> 00:07:40.343]  They know what they're doing.
[00:07:40.363 --> 00:07:43.504]  I mean, you don't have to believe a word they say, but watch how far they got.
[00:07:43.764 --> 00:07:44.664]  How did Clinton get there?
[00:07:44.684 --> 00:07:45.564]  How did Hillary get there?
[00:07:45.804 --> 00:07:47.465]  How did all these guys get there?
[00:07:47.485 --> 00:07:49.286]  They have methods to get to the top.
[00:07:49.366 --> 00:07:50.526]  Even if no one believes a word you say.
[00:07:54.295 --> 00:07:55.276]  You can be successful.
[00:07:55.356 --> 00:07:55.656]  Yes.
[00:07:58.318 --> 00:08:00.440]  Now that seems to me to be a book about sadness.
[00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:02.441]  Is it not?
[00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:02.881]  No.
[00:08:04.743 --> 00:08:06.804]  Can I give you an example of the truth here?
[00:08:06.984 --> 00:08:07.205]  Yes.
[00:08:07.565 --> 00:08:13.109]  Bill Clinton, when he was in college, would get women, girls, in bed.
[00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:14.090]  Not just in college.
[00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.671]  By listening.
[00:08:15.691 --> 00:08:16.612]  By listening to them.
[00:08:17.012 --> 00:08:17.252]  Yes.
[00:08:17.392 --> 00:08:18.313]  He was a great listener.
[00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:23.094]  And when friends of his couldn't get the girls of their dreams, he'd say, you gotta listen to these women.
[00:08:23.174 --> 00:08:25.495]  I thought growing up, you drank beer and you bragged.
[00:08:26.315 --> 00:08:29.057]  But he says, listen, because it's flattering.
[00:08:30.378 --> 00:08:31.399]  But it works.
[00:08:32.359 --> 00:08:36.402]  And then he goes into all these other forms of making people think you care about them.
[00:08:37.162 --> 00:08:45.767]  You see, you call up here, I might be rude to you, I'll tell you what I really think, I might hang up on you, talk over you, but it's not fake, see, because I don't care what you think about me.
[00:08:46.548 --> 00:08:46.788]  You see?
[00:08:48.175 --> 00:08:50.316]  At the end of the day, I care what I think about myself.
[00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:54.357]  And that's what people throughout history have actually been attracted to.
[00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:56.938]  They're selling you the fraud here.
[00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:57.518]  And it goes on.
[00:08:57.558 --> 00:08:58.759]  It gets much worse.
[00:09:00.339 --> 00:09:01.380]  Everything's a campaign.
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440]  Everything is posing.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.001]  Everything is putting on a front.
[00:09:04.341 --> 00:09:05.941]  Why, that's how you get your girl.
[00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:13.324]  No, the type of woman you would get off of putting on a front would be just as shallow as you are.
[00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:22.056]  The type of woman you would get would be some painted trollop, completely shallow and materialistic, who would be completely unhappy throughout your life.
[00:09:22.616 --> 00:09:26.000]  A real woman would have instinct and know you're a fake.
[00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:33.087]  So again, selling fraud, selling lies, selling the petty, the transient.
[00:09:33.107 --> 00:09:36.430]  We're going to come back, go through this, get into all the news.
[00:09:38.152 --> 00:09:40.254]  And I'll break down the very nature of the New World Order.
[00:09:40.274 --> 00:09:41.996]  You want to know who we're facing, what we're dealing with?
[00:09:42.016 --> 00:09:43.237]  I'm going to go over it.
[00:09:43.257 --> 00:09:51.065]  The websites are InfoWars.net, TruthNews.us, PrisonPlanet.tv, and InfoWars.com.
[00:10:03.522 --> 00:10:08.984]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:16.988]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.682 --> 00:10:24.747]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.128 --> 00:10:36.536]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:36.856 --> 00:10:40.439]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorists.
[00:10:40.819 --> 00:10:43.061]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.101 --> 00:10:46.944]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:00.748 --> 00:11:01.048]  That's $752.96, $371.30 and $185.65.
[00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:20.593]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:11:20.653 --> 00:11:24.975]  treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing the armed revolution.
[00:11:25.295 --> 00:11:33.758]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon, causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:11:33.778 --> 00:11:36.359]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:40.521]  Russia, Switzerland, and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:11:40.722 --> 00:11:47.125]  Economist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:11:47.466 --> 00:11:48.606]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:11:48.806 --> 00:11:54.170]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:54.550]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:54.750]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:12:01.614 --> 00:12:13.039]  A new cancer study conducted on 500 mice shows when they consumed MRET-activated water that it was nearly equal in effectiveness to chemotherapy, yet without toxic side effects.
[00:12:13.299 --> 00:12:26.305]  Another study done on mice intentionally infected with staphylococcal bacteria showed that 30% of those who drank regular water died from the infection, while 100% of the mice that drank MRET-activated water lived.
[00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:26.805]  Thank you.

[00:12:53.443 --> 00:12:53.644]  That's 888-988-3325.
[00:13:01.624 --> 00:13:03.385]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[00:13:03.686 --> 00:13:06.508]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:09.230]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:18.137]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[00:13:18.617 --> 00:13:19.178]  An example?
[00:13:19.718 --> 00:13:22.560]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[00:13:23.441 --> 00:13:26.203]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:29.826]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.783]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[00:13:36.423 --> 00:13:37.904]  Money is not the problem.
[00:13:38.124 --> 00:13:39.125]  Availability is.
[00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:41.506]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[00:13:41.746 --> 00:13:45.409]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[00:13:46.049 --> 00:13:48.130]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.191]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:49.251]  800-409-5633.
[00:14:04.474 --> 00:14:09.956]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:14:10.336 --> 00:14:12.037]  The lies and disinformation.
[00:14:14.718 --> 00:14:15.799]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:27.763]  We have a society that has been sold that lies aren't just acceptable, but that lies are good.
[00:14:29.564 --> 00:14:32.565]  And so let your children play with toys that are made out of lead paint.
[00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:34.006]  Go ahead and eat.
[00:14:35.387 --> 00:14:40.188]  Human food, not just dog food now that has plastic and toxins and poisons in it.
[00:14:42.849 --> 00:14:52.552]  Go ahead and buy a shovel that breaks the first time you use it, as long as it's cheap and has pretty paint on it, it's okay.
[00:14:53.672 --> 00:14:55.313]  See, we all lie to ourselves.
[00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:59.834]  We've been mesmerized, hypnotized, conditioned, trained
[00:15:00.589 --> 00:15:03.791]  to accept lies and accept corruption.
[00:15:03.891 --> 00:15:14.138]  And Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propagandist, the chief Nazi propagandist, said that good propaganda was base, was raw, was primitive.
[00:15:14.198 --> 00:15:16.020]  It just spoke to our own laziness.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:21.363]  It spoke to people's will to procrastinate and deny things are happening.
[00:15:22.444 --> 00:15:23.625]  We have hundreds of
[00:15:24.258 --> 00:15:33.745]  Publications made by the Council on Foreign Relations about how they were going to break down the sovereignty of the United States and deliver us into the hands of absolute despotism.
[00:15:34.646 --> 00:15:38.029]  We have David Rockefeller and his memoirs published four years ago saying it.
[00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:45.514]  We have him publishing editorials praising Mao Zedong's extermination operations in the New York Times in 1976.
[00:15:46.435 --> 00:15:48.757]  We have thousands of these documents.
[00:15:48.837 --> 00:15:50.198]  I mean, I'm swimming in them.
[00:15:50.848 --> 00:16:00.271]  And you walk up to the average know-it-all trendy on the street, and they've got a high IQ, they're doing well in business, and they'll laugh at you and they'll say, I've been trained not to care.
[00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:05.953]  Some of them will actually say that, just as Orwell wrote about 1984, and they'll giggle and they'll snicker.
[00:16:07.194 --> 00:16:09.775]  And they'll say, I've been trained vaccines are good.
[00:16:10.195 --> 00:16:11.295]  I give the injection.
[00:16:11.675 --> 00:16:13.716]  I've been trained lead paint is good for children.
[00:16:13.976 --> 00:16:14.596]  Ha ha ha!
[00:16:14.896 --> 00:16:19.458]  I mean, it's just a... and then you go down into the other classes,
[00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:29.584]  From the New World Order minion level down into just the baseline population who distrust the government and the media but doesn't know why they distrust them.
[00:16:29.624 --> 00:16:30.784]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:33.846]  You see, there's thousands of points in this.
[00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:35.947]  I don't hate sports.
[00:16:36.487 --> 00:16:39.248]  I played football and track and soccer and all that stuff.
[00:16:40.729 --> 00:16:50.634]  But by the time I was about 16, I was very sickened by people worshipping the first string football players, which I was a first string football player.
[00:16:51.637 --> 00:17:08.425]  I was very sickened by how mindless it was, and I just... my very bones knew that it was petty and transitory and didn't matter, so I got out of it and got away with it as... I got away from it as quickly as possible.
[00:17:11.127 --> 00:17:12.367]  And this is why I don't like it.
[00:17:12.908 --> 00:17:16.209]  The average child watches four and a half hours of television or more a day.
[00:17:16.229 --> 00:17:17.570]  The average adult more than four hours.
[00:17:18.462 --> 00:17:19.862]  Our society's falling apart.
[00:17:19.902 --> 00:17:24.423]  We have a greater private debt ratio than even in the depths of the Great Depression.
[00:17:26.424 --> 00:17:33.806]  Every major indices of a society crumbling is showing that and registering that.
[00:17:35.566 --> 00:17:40.787]  And I know people that when the University of Texas loses a football game, they're depressed for weeks.
[00:17:43.528 --> 00:17:47.869]  I mean, I see more concern on their faces than when they hear their grandmother has cancer.
[00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:51.771]  Because they've had their humanity sucked out of them.
[00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:53.332]  Or maybe they never even had it.
[00:17:53.592 --> 00:17:55.854]  They were bred by parents who didn't have much soul.
[00:17:56.114 --> 00:17:57.735]  Who were plastic, fake people.
[00:17:59.557 --> 00:18:08.924]  And I know quite a few nice people that I'm around routinely who invest so much importance
[00:18:10.158 --> 00:18:24.571]  In sports, or in things at the end of the day, NASCAR, their fake little church with their little pervert preacher, and driving his pimp mobile, that you never truly live, you never truly grow.
[00:18:25.031 --> 00:18:27.013]  You have been robbed of everything.
[00:18:33.877 --> 00:18:39.960]  And that's all I'm trying to say to you is you better look around and you better ask yourself what's happening in the world.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.821]  You better look at what's happening in your own life.
[00:18:42.842 --> 00:18:55.748]  And you need to take at least 10% of the time that you spend worshipping through others, worshipping at the altar of idols that aren't going to save you and aren't going to help you and aren't going to fulfill you.
[00:18:55.788 --> 00:18:58.009]  That's why you're on Prozac and Ritalin.
[00:18:58.290 --> 00:18:59.330]  That's why you're so miserable.
[00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:00.831]  That's why your family is so miserable.
[00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:02.732]  That's why you feel so weak.
[00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.831]  It's because you're not fulfilled.
[00:19:04.871 --> 00:19:06.392]  You don't have real missions in life.
[00:19:06.432 --> 00:19:07.233]  Let me tell you something.
[00:19:09.434 --> 00:19:27.528]  When you get that gleam in your eye of mad passion, when you feel that primitive spark, that drive in you, when you watch your football team or your baseball team make a score, that is only a shadow, a facsimile, a prosthesis.
[00:19:28.028 --> 00:19:29.189]  But it doesn't even help you walk.
[00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:36.767]  For something there that is meant for you to create real community, and real friendship, and real struggle.
[00:19:37.687 --> 00:19:39.528]  It's all part of human development.
[00:19:40.089 --> 00:19:41.870]  It is gladiatorial diversions.
[00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.131]  It is simulated combat.
[00:19:44.851 --> 00:19:56.598]  And so it takes the greatest energies we have as men and women in the short life that we are given, and it puts it off and shunts it off into things that don't matter, issues that don't matter.
[00:19:59.586 --> 00:20:12.512]  I assure you that the Dallas Cowboys winning or losing, or Florida State winning or losing, doesn't amount to a hell of beans.
[00:20:13.593 --> 00:20:16.374]  That your fantasy football doesn't matter.
[00:20:19.075 --> 00:20:26.819]  What does matter is that a very sinister, very cold-blooded scientific elite is in control.
[00:20:28.061 --> 00:20:45.990]  And they have already, by open declarative announcement, destroyed over 62% of the Greenback's value, and are savagely trumpeting their intentions to bring it down by at least another 25% in the next two years!
[00:20:47.991 --> 00:20:50.272]  Devastating your savings!
[00:20:51.353 --> 00:20:52.013]  Now, again,
[00:20:53.954 --> 00:21:12.963]  Over 2,000 years ago, state planners wrote about building more coliseums, more ball fields, more government-sponsored sports, so you wouldn't notice the debasing of your currency, so you wouldn't notice the corruption of the courts, so you wouldn't notice the disgusting activity in the streets, so you wouldn't notice.
[00:21:15.244 --> 00:21:21.146]  And that's all I'm saying, is that it isn't just that it wastes your life away, it's that it's meant to.
[00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:22.707]  It's designed to.
[00:21:23.638 --> 00:21:24.939]  Take the University of Texas.
[00:21:25.139 --> 00:21:28.660]  Over 40 billion dollars in their permanent fund.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.621]  That is separate.
[00:21:29.661 --> 00:21:30.661]  That's not for pensions.
[00:21:30.961 --> 00:21:32.122]  That's not for new buildings.
[00:21:32.762 --> 00:21:34.943]  That's separate from the budget.
[00:21:34.963 --> 00:21:36.224]  40 billion dollars.
[00:21:36.584 --> 00:21:39.285]  And you better believe the University of Texas
[00:21:39.925 --> 00:21:51.276]  Only cares about that, and that the people that run the Board of Directors, sitting in their gold-backed, gilded chairs, are thinking about their investments, and thinking about the operations they're running.
[00:21:51.676 --> 00:21:54.439]  They are not thinking about me, though.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.463]  You, the pathetic slaves, are.
[00:22:02.102 --> 00:22:09.369]  But see, Bill Clinton will sit there and listen to you, and tell you you're smart, and tell you you're sweet, while he stabs you in the back.
[00:22:09.509 --> 00:22:18.217]  I will desperately, like a fireman coming in a house, and some slovenly person won't get off their couch as the place is burning down, and I say, get up!
[00:22:18.277 --> 00:22:18.858]  Get out of here!
[00:22:18.878 --> 00:22:19.959]  Run for your life!
[00:22:19.999 --> 00:22:21.040]  It's about to cave in!
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:24.803]  And with drool dripping out your mouth, you look at me and go, Bebo!
[00:22:30.706 --> 00:22:34.248]  Yeah, you're so upset out there right now because you've been brainwashed and programmed.
[00:22:34.268 --> 00:22:36.329]  You're not mad about your dollar.
[00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:38.330]  You're not mad about your children having a future.
[00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:41.111]  You're mad about me striking out at Viva.
[00:22:41.711 --> 00:22:42.352]  You're God.
[00:22:42.692 --> 00:22:43.312]  You're King.
[00:22:43.712 --> 00:22:44.373]  You're Lord.
[00:22:45.053 --> 00:22:49.795]  In other parts of the country and the world, you have your own little pathetic idols that mean absolutely nothing.
[00:22:50.315 --> 00:22:50.996]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:51.016 --> 00:22:51.396]  Stay with me.
[00:23:00.325 --> 00:23:05.627]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:23:05.827 --> 00:23:07.888]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:23:08.128 --> 00:23:15.251]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:23:15.371 --> 00:23:26.896]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[00:23:27.296 --> 00:23:34.681]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[00:23:34.941 --> 00:23:39.945]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.
[00:23:40.065 --> 00:23:45.088]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[00:23:45.368 --> 00:23:50.912]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:23:51.452 --> 00:23:55.515]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:23:55.795 --> 00:23:57.056]  That's toll-free, triple
[00:23:57.056 --> 00:23:57.378]  Call 880-344-38.
[00:24:00.786 --> 00:24:01.466]  It's a fact.
[00:24:01.726 --> 00:24:09.268]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:24:09.428 --> 00:24:17.969]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:24:18.229 --> 00:24:28.851]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:24:29.111 --> 00:24:35.213]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:40.495]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:24:40.695 --> 00:24:45.217]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:24:45.377 --> 00:24:47.197]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:24:47.217 --> 00:24:47.438]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:24:47.458 --> 00:24:47.938]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:24:48.058 --> 00:24:49.938]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:24:57.741 --> 00:24:59.582]  We're good to go.
[00:25:25.674 --> 00:25:25.954]  I think so.
[00:25:49.079 --> 00:25:52.342]  Here are just a few of the benefits associated with heart and body extract.
[00:25:52.522 --> 00:25:55.584]  Blood sugar, cholesterol, and circulation levels return to normal.
[00:25:55.884 --> 00:25:56.945]  Arteries unclog.
[00:25:57.205 --> 00:25:59.006]  Angina is gone in just a few days.
[00:25:59.267 --> 00:26:00.688]  Blood pressure goes back to normal.
[00:26:00.868 --> 00:26:03.210]  An irregular heartbeat returns to normal.
[00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:05.051]  Heart and body extract works.
[00:26:05.311 --> 00:26:05.612]  I think so.
[00:26:20.208 --> 00:26:39.673]  I have a bad experience when it was a gentleman who was a colleague of mine for many many years and so we got him this product and he could not walk from his house to the mailbox to get his mail because he had congestive heart failure and after being on this product for about four to six weeks he was able to walk 50 minutes per day and after two months he was walking up the street miles per day.
[00:26:39.853 --> 00:26:41.994]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.
[00:26:42.354 --> 00:26:45.536]  To order your two-month supply, call now toll-free at 866-295-5305.
[00:26:45.556 --> 00:26:45.756]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:26:45.776 --> 00:26:47.477]  Or order online at hbextract.com.
[00:26:47.497 --> 00:26:49.178]  Heart and Body Extract, 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:04.183]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:27:05.124 --> 00:27:08.268]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.241]  Oh, I have the Associated Press here in front of me.
[00:27:35.742 --> 00:27:37.683]  But actually, I shouldn't spend any time on this.
[00:27:37.783 --> 00:27:39.883]  I can talk about sports instead.
[00:27:40.844 --> 00:27:46.126]  Officials say drug-caused Nigeria polio outbreak.
[00:27:46.226 --> 00:27:47.487]  Associated Press.
[00:27:49.386 --> 00:28:02.295]  A polio outbreak in Nigeria was caused by the vaccine designed to stop it, international health officials say, leaving at least 69, you can bet it's 5,000 children paralyzed.
[00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:08.800]  It is a frightening paradox in a part of the world that already distrusts Western vaccines.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:15.424]  This has happened hundreds and hundreds of times, making it even tougher to stamp out age-old diseases.
[00:28:15.885 --> 00:28:15.985]  Oh,
[00:28:16.804 --> 00:28:19.766]  It says they were giving the children the live polio vaccine.
[00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:24.569]  Banned for more than 20 years, but they still give it to East Austin children where I live.
[00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:30.893]  It has live simian virus 40 and many other live cancer viruses in it.
[00:28:31.473 --> 00:28:36.256]  I would add they don't tell you that here, but you could do 10 seconds of research and find out.
[00:28:36.897 --> 00:28:39.919]  But later we'll be... I see four or five of these every day.
[00:28:40.959 --> 00:28:43.202]  Villagers used to love the white medicine man.
[00:28:43.522 --> 00:28:47.467]  They've learned, though, to run literally into the jungle or the hills when the U.N.
[00:28:47.487 --> 00:28:47.907]  men come.
[00:28:47.948 --> 00:28:56.578]  And because the elders are given big cash payments to take it, the children are chained down and given their shots and then quietly die in the next few months.
[00:28:57.078 --> 00:29:00.002]  All part of the official eugenics program and operation.
[00:29:01.129 --> 00:29:03.470]  By the way, I like football and actually like Bevo.
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:10.151]  People in other parts of the country and the world are listening on satellite and things are probably saying, on AM and FM dial, things are saying, what is he talking about Bevo?
[00:29:10.191 --> 00:29:12.071]  It's the local UT god.
[00:29:12.091 --> 00:29:19.493]  And people don't care if the UT regents are investing the money in comprehensive annual financial reports, double sets of books.
[00:29:19.753 --> 00:29:21.574]  I mean, that doesn't really matter.
[00:29:21.614 --> 00:29:24.134]  As long as there's a bigger stadium, everything's fine.
[00:29:24.474 --> 00:29:27.795]  Double all the different tuitions and prices and everything.
[00:29:28.444 --> 00:29:34.048]  Just continue squeezing everyone at a supposedly state-funded institution that was supposed to be free to the Texans.
[00:29:34.709 --> 00:29:37.170]  They don't know that as long as we give them VIVO.
[00:29:37.671 --> 00:29:38.671]  That's all they care about.
[00:29:38.731 --> 00:29:39.512]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:29:39.572 --> 00:29:41.273]  Get into real issues.
[00:29:41.694 --> 00:29:44.736]  You can have compartmentalized in your life mindless things.
[00:29:45.356 --> 00:29:50.300]  I'm not saying I don't like a ball game, but I basically
[00:29:51.284 --> 00:29:58.309]  desecrated the idol, because we need to desecrate and throw down the things that don't matter, and start building up the things that do.
[00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:06.095]  You're only alive once, and I know we've got calls from Washington, Tennessee, Florida, Bastrop, Atlanta, New York, England, all over the place.
[00:30:07.076 --> 00:30:10.999]  I'm going to get to them here in a few minutes, but here is the new trailer for my film, Endgame.
[00:30:11.039 --> 00:30:11.680]  It's not out yet.
[00:30:11.700 --> 00:30:15.703]  It comes out October 26th, and this is what really matters.
[00:30:15.803 --> 00:30:18.645]  Issues like this really matter, and even if you don't believe me,
[00:30:20.575 --> 00:30:21.255]  5% chance I'm right.
[00:30:21.295 --> 00:30:21.836]  Let's say that.
[00:30:22.096 --> 00:30:24.238]  Of course, it's totally true, but don't believe me.
[00:30:24.378 --> 00:30:27.080]  Go research the claims I make.
[00:30:27.701 --> 00:30:29.763]  And you're going to be shocked when you find out they're true.
[00:30:29.783 --> 00:30:34.747]  And you're going to say, now, does the dollar being devalued by 62% in the last seven years matter?
[00:30:35.288 --> 00:30:37.129]  And most of that in the last year, it's accelerating.
[00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:41.393]  Or does some mascot?
[00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:45.697]  Or does the plan of the global elite to exterminate 80% of us
[00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:52.052]  And the heads of every major biology department at every major university spouting this off.
[00:30:52.513 --> 00:30:53.293]  Does that matter?
[00:30:53.633 --> 00:30:55.174]  When they have access to bioweapons?
[00:30:55.975 --> 00:31:02.079]  Or does acting cool and posing, like Chris Matthews says, everything's about posing and being fake.
[00:31:02.499 --> 00:31:02.820]  No.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.703]  A nation, a world built of fraud and quackery will implode.
[00:31:09.004 --> 00:31:11.566]  We were not always so weak, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:11.646 --> 00:31:12.987]  We were once made of steel.
[00:31:13.447 --> 00:31:14.368]  We need to remember that.
[00:31:15.128 --> 00:31:16.069]  Let's go to Endgame.
[00:31:17.415 --> 00:31:18.836]  It is a big idea.
[00:31:18.856 --> 00:31:20.978]  A new world order.
[00:31:25.341 --> 00:31:30.805]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:31.426 --> 00:31:34.388]  It's known as the Builder Burden Group.
[00:31:34.428 --> 00:31:36.669]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:38.851 --> 00:31:41.313]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order group
[00:31:42.188 --> 00:31:49.684]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:56.343 --> 00:32:01.387]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:32:03.209 --> 00:32:07.453]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:32:07.953 --> 00:32:10.996]  Dillberg is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:32:11.076 --> 00:32:14.639]  Only an educated form of it can stop them in their tracks.
[00:32:14.959 --> 00:32:15.159]  All right.
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.221]  Shut up, you guys.
[00:32:17.621 --> 00:32:20.702]  For the first time, all the pieces have been put together.
[00:32:21.362 --> 00:32:24.742]  The dots have been connected, and the picture is crystal clear.
[00:32:25.863 --> 00:32:30.163]  Earth's ruling elite believe they have discovered the fountain.
[00:32:30.203 --> 00:32:34.404]  But before they can attain it, 80% of us must die.
[00:32:35.984 --> 00:32:41.926]  A psychopathic technocracy is establishing world government so there can be no escape from their plan.
[00:32:47.361 --> 00:32:49.622]  The New World Order is the Old World Order.
[00:32:49.662 --> 00:32:51.963]  I mean, it's just the names have changed, the appearances have changed.
[00:32:52.643 --> 00:32:53.783]  Most people have no idea.
[00:32:53.803 --> 00:32:54.584]  They're not after money.
[00:32:54.604 --> 00:32:55.704]  They have all the money they need.
[00:32:55.924 --> 00:32:56.684]  They're after power.
[00:32:57.625 --> 00:32:58.545]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[00:32:59.225 --> 00:33:02.687]  I have a pull-up with a plane in Munich.
[00:33:02.707 --> 00:33:03.887]  They interrogated me for four hours.
[00:33:03.967 --> 00:33:04.947]  Some shots were fired.
[00:33:04.967 --> 00:33:07.308]  We need you to move off the property.
[00:33:07.348 --> 00:33:10.950]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:33:15.823 --> 00:33:18.385]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:33:18.646 --> 00:33:20.247]  You have been warned.
[00:33:22.309 --> 00:33:25.652]  Absolutely, and it comes to the InfoWars October 26th.
[00:33:25.852 --> 00:33:29.395]  It comes to the web first.
[00:33:29.435 --> 00:33:34.819]  See, we turn things on their head, and then it'll be in stores nationwide November 12th.
[00:33:37.422 --> 00:33:40.664]  You can start buying the DVDs right now, pre-ordering at InfoWars.com.
[00:33:40.704 --> 00:33:41.946]  I'll be shipping them out November 1st.
[00:33:44.344 --> 00:33:46.305]  You can make copies and give them to Four Winds.
[00:33:48.386 --> 00:33:51.148]  You know, I've been right about everything else, listeners, new listeners.
[00:33:53.189 --> 00:34:01.253]  And knowing the reality, knowing what we face gets your head screwed on straight real fast and you stop being little boys.
[00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:04.975]  And I see men out there who are perpetually little boys.
[00:34:05.515 --> 00:34:12.519]  I see these men that will cut you off in traffic and bulge their eyes out at you, but a cop pulls them over, they'll wet themselves.
[00:34:14.193 --> 00:34:19.234]  I see these men out there strutting around, sticking their chests out with a 12-pack of beer, walking out of a store.
[00:34:19.655 --> 00:34:23.536]  They think watching a ball game and acting tough is what a man does.
[00:34:23.956 --> 00:34:24.956]  A man is humble.
[00:34:25.456 --> 00:34:26.896]  A man takes care of his family.
[00:34:27.177 --> 00:34:29.837]  A man knows the environment he lives in is informed.
[00:34:30.077 --> 00:34:32.278]  And a man is involved and understands history.
[00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:36.679]  That's what measured men in the past.
[00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:43.301]  Not how you could stick your chest out and festoon yourself with whatever the latest fashion is.
[00:34:45.009 --> 00:34:46.910]  And this country needs men to save it.
[00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:53.293]  You know, Chris Matthews gets up on television and says, the age of lying is here, lying is good, and that's how you're successful.
[00:34:54.474 --> 00:34:58.676]  That's how you get your woman, that's how you get your job, that's how you... No, that's not how!
[00:34:58.936 --> 00:35:01.337]  I don't want to be around a bunch of liars and a bunch of fakes!
[00:35:01.677 --> 00:35:02.678]  And a bunch of frauds!
[00:35:03.795 --> 00:35:17.721]  And all these social climbers that do whatever they think, and the groveling, I can't go to parties, I can't hardly be around people anymore, because you get around these social climbers and they're so fake, and they hate your guts, and they're not real people.
[00:35:18.521 --> 00:35:22.443]  And they'll sit there and they'll look you in the eyes and you can just see how weak they are.
[00:35:22.463 --> 00:35:27.025]  I mean, I tell you folks, you have fallen so far.
[00:35:27.465 --> 00:35:32.747]  But I know there are tens of millions of people in this country, and hundreds of millions worldwide who are still human.
[00:35:33.587 --> 00:35:45.391]  And who still know that the fraud of saying that what you act like is what you are, and that some front... And then the establishment can say what is successful.
[00:35:45.731 --> 00:35:49.732]  The establishment can say what is important.
[00:35:50.032 --> 00:35:51.012]  And then you imitate it.
[00:35:51.032 --> 00:35:59.535]  I mean, I remember reading stuff written 80 years ago about the Department of War, where they were hiring top psychiatrists on how to dumb down the public through the media.
[00:36:00.928 --> 00:36:18.072]  And how to break up the family and get rid of the middle classes, all declassified and all public, and you see the... I mean, why do you think Fox Television and all these shows and on every TV show, the man is weak, he's dumb, he's an idiot, the guy who gets all the girls is an idiot and can't talk and, you know, is a fool?
[00:36:18.452 --> 00:36:21.013]  And then young men watch that and imprint as mammals?
[00:36:21.473 --> 00:36:24.754]  We're meant to mimic those we see above us?
[00:36:26.135 --> 00:36:28.379]  And then they go act like that and can't ever get women.
[00:36:28.679 --> 00:36:29.962]  Can't ever be successful.
[00:36:30.242 --> 00:36:32.786]  And so they think then, oh I must act stupider.
[00:36:33.207 --> 00:36:34.089]  That will get me women.
[00:36:34.853 --> 00:36:52.186]  I mean, they understand our mammal activity, our basic behavior, and they just program you and manipulate you and laugh at you and write best-selling books about how they're going to destroy the country, and they're doing it right now, and you just giggle and look up with dim little eyes and say, no, there's no new world order.
[00:36:52.507 --> 00:36:53.547]  It doesn't exist.
[00:36:53.988 --> 00:36:55.189]  Everything is fine.
[00:36:55.209 --> 00:36:57.090]  We're going to come back and go right to your calls.
[00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.931]  Stay with us.
[00:37:00.359 --> 00:37:05.681]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:37:05.861 --> 00:37:07.942]  Your source for free solar electricity.

[00:37:15.424 --> 00:37:26.948]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:34.733]  It's multi-voltage capabilities, multiple adapters, and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.

[00:37:40.117 --> 00:37:45.140]  Disconnect your application, the system automatically begins charging its own rechargeable batteries.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.804]  Get the incredible Berkey Solar Charger for only $75 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:37:52.125 --> 00:37:53.325]  That's toll-free, triple-free.
[00:37:58.169 --> 00:38:05.836]  Hi, Steve Schenck, Fearless Task Force.
[00:38:06.336 --> 00:38:08.118]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[00:38:08.418 --> 00:38:11.561]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:38:12.001 --> 00:38:13.623]  How would it be to find $75, $150, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:21.417]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[00:38:21.957 --> 00:38:24.299]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[00:38:24.939 --> 00:38:33.385]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[00:38:33.925 --> 00:38:36.627]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[00:38:37.288 --> 00:38:40.070]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:45.053]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark,
[00:38:45.788 --> 00:38:49.313]  For an understanding of what a financial genius you truly are, call 800-409-5633.

[00:39:00.719 --> 00:39:08.325]  What if I told you that you could put up a brand new building and save up to half the cost and up to half the time as similar conventional construction?
[00:39:08.545 --> 00:39:09.866]  It probably sounds too good to be true.

[00:39:13.009 --> 00:39:19.894]  If you need retail, office, or warehouse space, or if your church or school wants to expand and save money, you need General Steel.

[00:39:33.104 --> 00:39:37.787]  You can even add the look of brick, stucco or stone to achieve the look you want.
[00:39:38.047 --> 00:39:41.530]  If you still think this sounds too good to be true, then pick up the phone and call.

[00:40:00.502 --> 00:40:07.464]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[00:40:07.685 --> 00:40:08.945]  We got immediate results.
[00:40:09.285 --> 00:40:14.007]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual when he's disrespectful, defiant, or even abusive?
[00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:15.087]  Do you know how to fix it?

[00:40:32.895 --> 00:40:37.838]  The Total Transformation is the program I've used for over 30 years to solve even the worst behavior problems.

[00:40:47.543 --> 00:40:48.004]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 Call now!
[00:40:48.024 --> 00:40:49.204]  1-800-373-0402 1-800-373-0402 Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:41:05.402 --> 00:41:10.203]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:41:11.383 --> 00:41:22.606]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:41:23.426 --> 00:41:27.667]  I just walked down the hall to get a cup of coffee, and what did I see?
[00:41:28.187 --> 00:41:32.648]  Lewis Black, that's a fake name by the way, a carpetbagger that came into Austin.
[00:41:33.223 --> 00:41:35.565]  Decades ago and set up the Austin Chronicle.
[00:41:36.606 --> 00:41:41.229]  Once it got a giant cover story about how we need to attack the Second Amendment.
[00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:45.273]  A bunch of anti-gun garbage I just scanned through in the last few minutes.
[00:41:45.773 --> 00:41:50.457]  The establishment's instinct to totally disarm us so they can have their way with us.
[00:41:51.383 --> 00:41:57.649]  Why don't you write articles, Black, about how governments killed over 200 million people last century?
[00:41:58.369 --> 00:42:03.514]  Why don't you write an article about how the international banking cartel financed 90% of that?
[00:42:04.195 --> 00:42:10.000]  Why don't you tell the truth instead of writing articles saying the Toll Road Company isn't foreign?
[00:42:11.181 --> 00:42:13.283]  How dumb do you think your readers are?
[00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:16.346]  I'm just sick of lies!
[00:42:16.606 --> 00:42:17.667]  I'm sick of it!
[00:42:18.729 --> 00:42:23.851]  And I'm sick of you being mesmerized by things that don't matter so they can run these lies on you!
[00:42:29.053 --> 00:42:30.874]  I said I'd take calls, and the phones are loaded here.
[00:42:34.496 --> 00:42:35.796]  Let's go ahead and take a few here.
[00:42:36.597 --> 00:42:38.037]  Let's go ahead and talk to George.
[00:42:39.298 --> 00:42:40.778]  Wait, he's not first here.
[00:42:40.978 --> 00:42:46.060]  Let's talk to Kyle and Bastrop first, right around Central Texas.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.121]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:56.516]  Hey Alex, I totally agree with what you're saying about the UT and everybody worshipping the athletes and everything.
[00:42:56.536 --> 00:43:04.221]  You know, I have friends, you know, we were watching a game the other day and he was just knowing everything about Vince Young and I'm like, hey dude, they're a Dollars Indie guy and everything.
[00:43:04.241 --> 00:43:06.983]  He's like, oh whatever dude, why do you pay attention to that?
[00:43:07.003 --> 00:43:09.444]  You know, I agree with you there.
[00:43:09.464 --> 00:43:13.847]  You know, it's so, you know, it's hard to deal with people sometimes.
[00:43:14.228 --> 00:43:16.189]  And we don't eat beef on game day.
[00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:17.590]  That's bad luck for Bevo.
[00:43:18.462 --> 00:43:34.490]  Oh, I mean... I mean, seriously, I see people, a lot of these kids, you know, that are, you know, going to ACC or local college or whatever, and they have no money, but they'll go and spend 300 bucks per ticket, and then, you know, they wonder why they have no money.
[00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.491]  You know, they're spending on Xbox 360 here.
[00:43:36.731 --> 00:43:42.273]  Well, I mean, I mean, the credit card companies have the financial advisors at the school, who they're paying, by the way.
[00:43:42.313 --> 00:43:43.634]  It's totally illegal, but they do it.
[00:43:44.315 --> 00:43:48.038]  Uh, you know, it's legalized criminality to tell them to get more credit cards.
[00:43:48.078 --> 00:43:49.860]  The whole thing is meant to rape people.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:51.102]  And here's my point.
[00:43:51.522 --> 00:43:54.085]  People don't know about, you know, their family history.
[00:43:54.125 --> 00:43:56.507]  They don't know about, you know, anything.
[00:43:56.527 --> 00:43:58.830]  There's all these amazing things going on.
[00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:04.736]  But all they know about is issues that don't matter today, much less tomorrow.
[00:44:04.796 --> 00:44:14.146]  That's all I'm saying, is that people could be into sports and things, but it's that it is designed, it is given all of this attention to destroy.
[00:44:14.246 --> 00:44:18.110]  It is given all this attention to be a distraction from real issues.
[00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:20.191]  Oh, I agree, you know.
[00:44:21.112 --> 00:44:22.114]  I work at a bank, you know.
[00:44:22.134 --> 00:44:25.938]  I see a lot of people who come through who don't even know how to fill out a deposit slip, you know.
[00:44:25.958 --> 00:44:26.939]  They don't have their account number.
[00:44:27.039 --> 00:44:28.381]  I mean... Here's the deal.
[00:44:28.481 --> 00:44:31.905]  I used to go... I've been going to that Bob Bullock IMAX theater since it opened.
[00:44:31.925 --> 00:44:32.426]  What, 8, 9, 10 years ago?
[00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:40.294]  I've probably seen 10, 15 IMAX films there, because I don't watch a lot of TV, but I go see IMAX films occasionally.
[00:44:40.334 --> 00:44:43.175]  I saw Sea Monsters in 3D, unbelievably powerful.
[00:44:44.256 --> 00:44:45.616]  Best 3D I've ever seen last night.
[00:44:46.076 --> 00:44:53.500]  And it was the first time that the crowd was so dumb, I tried to tell them don't throw their glasses, the 3D glasses, you know, in the trash.
[00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.881]  They thought the trash can was the place to put them.
[00:44:56.101 --> 00:45:00.723]  And I didn't argue, I just watched everybody line up, and I told them, no, no guys, the bucket's out in the hall.
[00:45:01.263 --> 00:45:03.164]  But they didn't used to do that, that's the point.
[00:45:03.964 --> 00:45:05.225]  Everyone's unraveling!
[00:45:05.305 --> 00:45:06.426]  It's like they're zombies!
[00:45:06.486 --> 00:45:08.707]  It's like Attack of the Living Dead, man!
[00:45:08.727 --> 00:45:12.750]  And they've all got Bebo shirts on and they're all throwing them in the trash can!
[00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:16.892]  Because, listen, less than 4% of Americans now read a book in a year!
[00:45:17.273 --> 00:45:20.034]  I mean, they just are made to be raped, folks!
[00:45:20.334 --> 00:45:22.196]  And the government's totally bought and paid for it!
[00:45:22.576 --> 00:45:24.377]  I mean, I appreciate your call, man.
[00:45:24.577 --> 00:45:25.498]  I mean, here's another example.
[00:45:26.838 --> 00:45:27.979]  They play little games with you.
[00:45:27.999 --> 00:45:30.561]  They have this big national blitz on radio and TV.
[00:45:31.582 --> 00:45:40.527]  Right before the Iraq War going, the dirty Frenchies want some of the weapons and building contracts, but they didn't support the war.
[00:45:40.968 --> 00:45:43.489]  Americans, are we going to give that to dirty Frenchies?
[00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:46.191]  No, no dirty Frenchies!
[00:45:46.951 --> 00:45:52.814]  Alright, everybody knows the dirty Freedom Fries, all this, you know, I'm not going to drink red wine anymore, all this stuff.
[00:45:53.655 --> 00:45:57.017]  And they go, that's right, that's why Halliburton gets no-bid contracts.
[00:45:57.597 --> 00:46:00.819]  And then I hear National Host knowingly treating you like you're idiots.
[00:46:01.437 --> 00:46:05.159]  See, they'll talk to you, that, oh, I like you, you good American.
[00:46:05.399 --> 00:46:06.640]  Oh, you're a great American.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:07.841]  You're a fine American.
[00:46:08.061 --> 00:46:11.863]  Most of these guys are famous beatniks from the 60s, turned fake conservative.
[00:46:11.883 --> 00:46:14.104]  I mean, it's so sick what they do to you.
[00:46:15.605 --> 00:46:17.486]  When the debate was about U.S.
[00:46:17.546 --> 00:46:20.808]  companies couldn't bid, they were no-bid contracts.
[00:46:21.268 --> 00:46:23.189]  Foreigners were never allowed to have bids.
[00:46:23.849 --> 00:46:24.370]  Now,
[00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:29.176]  Halliburton and almost every one of those companies have moved to Dubai.
[00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:30.957]  Cheney's bought a house in Dubai.
[00:46:31.257 --> 00:46:35.461]  Cheney dumped all of his currency stock into Euros last year.
[00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:37.603]  He's totally forsaking America.
[00:46:38.103 --> 00:46:39.184]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[00:46:39.204 --> 00:46:41.426]  They're going to run around with tears in their eyes.
[00:46:41.886 --> 00:46:45.229]  Blackwater USA, oh, they're not mercenaries, they're loyal Americans.
[00:46:45.949 --> 00:46:49.832]  20% of the Iraq forces, illegal aliens legalized, most of them aggravated felons.
[00:46:50.273 --> 00:46:54.115]  I mean, you couldn't... I mean, we have troops that are foreigners who are aggravated felons.
[00:46:54.536 --> 00:47:00.300]  We have giant, 180,000 mercenary army running around, saying they'll operate domestically.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.903]  We have the corporations all... Let me give you a little news flash.
[00:47:05.244 --> 00:47:10.568]  The people claiming that they're patriotic have all written white papers.
[00:47:10.988 --> 00:47:13.390]  I mean, Cheney, Rockefeller, Bush, all of them.
[00:47:14.799 --> 00:47:16.620]  Saying they want the end of the United States.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:18.240]  Saying they want a new world order.
[00:47:19.060 --> 00:47:19.681]  Here's an article.
[00:47:19.701 --> 00:47:21.901]  It's just in my stack.
[00:47:21.921 --> 00:47:22.322]  Where'd it go?
[00:47:22.342 --> 00:47:24.622]  I've still got it on the screen.
[00:47:24.882 --> 00:47:26.623]  Times of London today.
[00:47:26.663 --> 00:47:27.143]  Sunday Times.
[00:47:27.683 --> 00:47:30.444]  Bush tortures follow where the Nazis led.
[00:47:30.724 --> 00:47:32.725]  See, demonizing the name of the U.S.
[00:47:32.945 --> 00:47:33.725]  all by design.
[00:47:35.146 --> 00:47:36.746]  It's all part of the globalist plan.
[00:47:37.026 --> 00:47:40.207]  But you can't figure that out, some of you neocons and liberals out there.
[00:47:40.227 --> 00:47:42.048]  By the way, I have literally
[00:47:42.845 --> 00:47:44.446]  Twenty, thirty articles a week.
[00:47:44.486 --> 00:47:49.648]  It's probably, there's like five today I saw, where Bush is meeting with Hillary's people every week.
[00:47:49.668 --> 00:47:51.469]  They're appointing all these Clinton people.
[00:47:52.209 --> 00:47:54.970]  I knew before that Clinton was CIA, met with Bush Sr.
[00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:57.611]  eleven times in the year before the election, went to Bilderberg with him.
[00:47:58.071 --> 00:47:58.972]  I reported on that.
[00:47:59.032 --> 00:48:07.215]  I had Terry Reid, the high-level CIA, who was at MENA Arkansas and unloading the cocaine and seeing all these people.
[00:48:08.001 --> 00:48:09.703]  I mean, this is a published book.
[00:48:09.743 --> 00:48:10.443]  They don't deny it.
[00:48:10.884 --> 00:48:19.551]  I mean, I've interviewed the people at Ellaponga Air Base, number one DEA agent Sully Castillo, watching high-level government officials loading the cocaine.
[00:48:19.951 --> 00:48:23.294]  I mean, folks, Bill Clinton, George Bush, give me a break!
[00:48:23.714 --> 00:48:26.096]  This is so staged, it makes my head spin.
[00:48:26.316 --> 00:48:30.040]  And here it is, New York Times, London Guardian.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:35.064]  I've got five stories today covering all of this, and it says in the clearest
[00:48:35.769 --> 00:48:37.069]  Sign of a shift in gear.
[00:48:37.109 --> 00:48:46.891]  Defense Secretary Robert Gates is in appointment of John Harm, a former official in the President Clinton's administration, to chair the Defense Policy Board, once led by Richard Perle.
[00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:52.293]  I mean, Hillary's collected more money than all the Republicans combined, and double any Democrat.
[00:48:52.473 --> 00:48:53.733]  They've never had numbers like that.
[00:48:53.933 --> 00:48:55.613]  The Republicans aren't really running.
[00:48:55.913 --> 00:48:57.174]  They just collect campaign money.
[00:48:57.194 --> 00:48:58.634]  The only real candidates were on Paul.
[00:49:00.942 --> 00:49:11.750]  I mean, I remember with horror learning from New York insiders that Rupert Murdoch and Roger Ailes were literally behind Hillary Clinton five years ago.
[00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:12.670]  I warned you about that.
[00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:13.651]  I said, it's going to be Hillary.
[00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:14.732]  It's all staged.
[00:49:14.752 --> 00:49:15.172]  They're meeting.
[00:49:15.192 --> 00:49:15.992]  I got this from New York.
[00:49:16.393 --> 00:49:22.837]  A year later, it was the New York Observer about how they have secret four-hour dinners every week.
[00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:25.299]  Okay, now it's out in the open.
[00:49:25.559 --> 00:49:26.760]  Fundraisers for her.
[00:49:27.799 --> 00:49:28.919]  It's staged.
[00:49:29.139 --> 00:49:30.380]  Let me tell you again.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:32.220]  At that level, it's staged.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:37.262]  The only candidate who is real is Ron Paul, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:37.282 --> 00:49:42.043]  Dennis Kucinich is a confiscate the guns, hardcore New World Order person.
[00:49:42.364 --> 00:49:43.844]  I don't want to hear how he's going to save me.
[00:49:43.944 --> 00:49:44.364]  Please.
[00:49:45.845 --> 00:49:47.545]  Now the left's finally waking up to this.
[00:49:47.765 --> 00:49:52.487]  I mean, Hillary Clinton went to Bilderberg Group in 2006 illegally, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:53.347 --> 00:49:53.847]  She was there.
[00:49:54.207 --> 00:49:55.387]  Violation of the Logan Act.
[00:49:56.168 --> 00:49:57.008]  So did Rick Perry.
[00:49:59.076 --> 00:49:59.476]  This year?
[00:50:01.158 --> 00:50:02.639]  I remember talking about Bilderberg Group.
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:07.183]  I was on another talk station out of Austin ten years ago and you'd call up and laugh at me, folks.
[00:50:07.223 --> 00:50:08.244]  It's not funny anymore.
[00:50:08.504 --> 00:50:17.673]  Before you giggle and snicker, just please go Google it and see the Dallas Morning News, Austin American Statesman, Houston Chronicle reported secret meeting of the world's elite.
[00:50:18.073 --> 00:50:23.398]  I mean, these people, and the Chronicle writes articles saying Cintra isn't Spanish owned, Cintra's involved in all this.
[00:50:24.437 --> 00:50:25.538]  Yeah, how are you doing Alex?
[00:50:25.558 --> 00:50:26.698]  This is Dan from We Are Change.
[00:50:26.718 --> 00:50:29.720]  Just wanted to thank you again for coming to New York on September 11th.
[00:50:44.031 --> 00:50:59.714]  Sean McCall mentioned something I heard on interview with Jeff Rents, an individual by the name of Jeffrey Smith, wrote a book, Genetic Roulette, and what he's discovered, that the GM foods are actually starting to, they're damaging the birth rates.
[00:50:59.914 --> 00:51:01.114]  They're damaging the testicles.
[00:51:01.134 --> 00:51:03.214]  He didn't, well, number one, he didn't discover that.
[00:51:03.294 --> 00:51:05.355]  Top Nobel Prize winners did that I've interviewed.
[00:51:05.375 --> 00:51:11.336]  Because what happens is, I mean, if we give a source as some writer who wrote about it, yes, and it's an absolute fact,
[00:51:11.836 --> 00:51:15.618]  But these paid-for shills on radio get up there and tell you cyanide's good for you.
[00:51:16.238 --> 00:51:16.699]  Exactly.
[00:51:16.979 --> 00:51:27.184]  And I just wanted, you know, as we sit here and watch society degenerate and disintegrate, you know, at the same time, there is the yin-yang, the opposite explosion of people waking up.
[00:51:27.845 --> 00:51:31.206]  We've actually just launched our 22nd chapter of We Are Change.
[00:51:31.487 --> 00:51:33.568]  It's Mikey Torbuk, it's going viral.
[00:51:33.608 --> 00:51:35.869]  We have one in Ireland now, Phoenix.
[00:51:37.778 --> 00:51:39.999]  Hey man, you keep it up, brother.
[00:51:40.039 --> 00:51:40.699]  I gotta jump.
[00:51:40.799 --> 00:51:50.124]  Alright, I'm gonna come back into the second hour, go right to your calls, and then, uh, they've announced they're gonna invent the first artificial life.

[00:53:31.971 --> 00:53:40.852]  The amount of societal, environmental, economic upheaval that's happening right now has never before been seen in the history of mankind.
[00:53:41.232 --> 00:53:43.753]  Everything is accelerating because of technology.
[00:53:46.313 --> 00:53:48.614]  The global elite have in a hundred
[00:53:49.332 --> 00:54:05.459]  Plus books and hundreds of speeches and statements they've made said that within a few decades they will have life extension technologies that can take a person and easily make them live past 150.
[00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:11.882]  If they can live that long, they'll be able to get
[00:54:12.734 --> 00:54:21.841]  To a point where technologies would have been developed, where basically eternal life, or vastly extended life, we're talking about thousands of years, will be available.
[00:54:22.722 --> 00:54:34.031]  And the elite publicly, but they know the general public doesn't read, it's quite a paradox, is going to want access to this, and so we have to be exterminated before they publicly use it.
[00:54:34.351 --> 00:54:39.916]  They even talk about how they're already having to stage their own deaths, so that the public is not aware of this.
[00:54:41.184 --> 00:54:42.984]  And they couch it in hypothetical terms.
[00:54:43.545 --> 00:54:44.705]  Very, very serious.
[00:54:45.185 --> 00:54:48.606]  My film, Endgame, in the last chapter covers this.
[00:54:50.206 --> 00:54:51.386]  And it comes out later in the month.
[00:54:51.406 --> 00:54:52.507]  Look, I haven't got enough calls.
[00:54:52.567 --> 00:54:54.667]  Okay, we're going to get to everybody.
[00:54:55.827 --> 00:55:00.909]  We're going to get to Jay, and David, and George, and Joe, and Paula, and everybody else that's holding.
[00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:03.769]  And then later, I'm going to get into the globalist master plan a little bit.
[00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:05.550]  I said I would, and I am today.
[00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:08.190]  Just, I'm going to try to pare it down to the very basics.
[00:55:09.531 --> 00:55:10.651]  I tend to pontificate.
[00:55:11.559 --> 00:55:12.700]  But there will be no hyperbole.
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.881]  I will actually get to just the basic facts.
[00:55:15.742 --> 00:55:18.904]  I Am Creating Artificial Life declares you as a gene pioneer.
[00:55:19.344 --> 00:55:22.226]  This is out of the largest paper in England and Europe, The London Guardian.
[00:55:22.627 --> 00:55:25.609]  Yesterday, it's up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:31.073]  Right now, or just type into Google or your favorite search engine, I Am Creating Artificial Life and click News.
[00:55:32.233 --> 00:55:32.934]  For those that would like to
[00:55:33.613 --> 00:55:38.274]  Check out this, and then that ties in with the last caller, who I apologize for having to cut short, but we hit the end of the hour.
[00:55:38.734 --> 00:55:43.516]  Brought up genetic engineering, and I thought I would also talk about what they know.
[00:55:43.616 --> 00:55:44.676]  This is not my opinion.
[00:55:46.416 --> 00:55:47.337]  This is what they know.
[00:55:47.857 --> 00:55:51.638]  This is what they know about the food you're eating on the store shelves.
[00:55:51.778 --> 00:55:53.038]  They know it's doing it.
[00:55:54.298 --> 00:55:55.099]  This is too important.
[00:55:55.139 --> 00:55:56.479]  I can't just mention it and not get to it.
[00:55:56.499 --> 00:55:58.539]  I'm not trying to plant a hook here to make you tune in later.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]  I'll do it at the bottom of the hour, though.
[00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:00.480]  I still have to go to calls.
[00:56:01.169 --> 00:56:04.432]  Remind me, Trev, I forget, to get into what genetic-engineered foods do.
[00:56:04.792 --> 00:56:08.835]  And I don't mean how they disinfo you and say, you mean like breeding dogs?
[00:56:08.915 --> 00:56:09.676]  Genetic engineering?
[00:56:09.716 --> 00:56:10.376]  It's all bad.
[00:56:10.736 --> 00:56:10.957]  No.
[00:56:11.237 --> 00:56:12.298]  Cross-species.
[00:56:12.838 --> 00:56:14.920]  Massive gene splicing.
[00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:16.501]  That's what we're talking about.
[00:56:16.521 --> 00:56:17.021]  Okay?
[00:56:17.361 --> 00:56:18.142]  Chimera.
[00:56:18.943 --> 00:56:19.603]  From the Greek.
[00:56:21.305 --> 00:56:24.587]  Let us now go ahead and take a call.
[00:56:26.048 --> 00:56:28.290]  This phone system confuses my feeble brain.
[00:56:29.302 --> 00:56:35.726]  Let's go ahead and first go to Jay in Tennessee, and then we'll go to many others.
[00:56:36.187 --> 00:56:36.967]  Jay, you're on the air.
[00:56:37.007 --> 00:56:37.307]  Welcome.
[00:56:38.308 --> 00:56:38.968]  Alex, what's up?
[00:56:39.008 --> 00:56:39.909]  I called in Friday.
[00:56:40.129 --> 00:56:41.210]  I'm fired up like you.
[00:56:41.870 --> 00:56:43.531]  You called in Friday and I had to cut you off.
[00:56:43.551 --> 00:56:49.115]  You were getting into the authorized biography of the Rockefellers, which just admits all this stuff.
[00:56:49.535 --> 00:56:50.616]  Quickly, go ahead and tell us about it.
[00:56:50.636 --> 00:56:51.276]  Exactly.
[00:56:51.296 --> 00:56:52.277]  I'm fired up like you.
[00:56:52.297 --> 00:56:55.019]  Listen, this is up there with Tragi and Hope by Carol Quigley.
[00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:58.452]  Uh, probably not as good as that, but it's up there.
[00:56:58.693 --> 00:57:01.956]  But the general public is telling them it's an admission by them.
[00:57:02.036 --> 00:57:02.877]  Go ahead.
[00:57:02.917 --> 00:57:08.322]  Yeah, it's a...Horovitz and Collier wrote an opera.
[00:57:08.342 --> 00:57:13.327]  They were the only ones at this time in the 60s that had access to the Rockefeller's personal archives.
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:19.424]  And listen, we've got, in chapter 4, we've got Edith, who is John Dee's first daughter.
[00:57:19.924 --> 00:57:28.590]  She goes off into the occult, she studies under Zhang, she goes crazy, thinks she's the reincarnation of an Egyptian pharaoh's bride.
[00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.131]  Always big into the devil tree.
[00:57:31.932 --> 00:57:38.736]  We've got, in chapter 9, we've got Junior Rockefeller's plan to create a one-world religion, and it's very explicit.
[00:57:38.756 --> 00:57:42.559]  He wants to, you know, he funds a world council of churches and whatnot.
[00:57:43.118 --> 00:57:45.239]  Which took over all the major denominations, mm-hmm.
[00:57:45.479 --> 00:57:45.719]  Right.
[00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:51.000]  We've got Chapter 13, we've got Nelson talking about his trips to Bohemian Grove.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:54.661]  Chapter 15, we talked about Nelson's CIA ties.
[00:57:55.881 --> 00:58:10.725]  Chapter 16, along the lines of, you know, your new film, Endgame, we've got John D. Rockefeller III talking about his meetings with members of the Communist Chinese government.
[00:58:11.499 --> 00:58:18.087]  Because he really... Right away, they financed them to have the one-child policy and so China was set up because they do all that.
[00:58:18.388 --> 00:58:28.821]  You know, I tell you what, tell folks again the title of the book because a couple years ago, because I don't just believe quotes on the internet, I bought that book just to get quotes, double-checked a couple quotes, never read it.
[00:58:29.781 --> 00:58:35.504]  Tell folks again, and are you going to write up an article just with basic quotes of theirs for PrisonPlanet.com?
[00:58:35.524 --> 00:58:37.004]  I'm in the process, Alex.
[00:58:37.024 --> 00:58:38.265]  Well, don't take forever.
[00:58:38.305 --> 00:58:40.466]  Get it out, because I'm so busy I can't do it either.
[00:58:40.486 --> 00:58:42.026]  So I'm counting on you.
[00:58:42.306 --> 00:58:50.730]  But for those that want to actually go buy it at a library, or check it out at a library, or buy it at Barnes and Nobles or wherever, or Amazon, tell them the title of the book.
[00:58:51.390 --> 00:58:55.932]  It's The Rockefellers, An American Dynasty, by Peter Collier and David Horowitz.
[00:58:56.704 --> 00:59:00.485]  And it's, in fact, I've got a, which version do you have?
[00:59:00.505 --> 00:59:01.705]  Because there's several editions.
[00:59:02.806 --> 00:59:06.147]  I think I have the older edition, probably one of the first or second.
[00:59:06.507 --> 00:59:09.208]  Yeah, yours sounds like it's got some stuff in it I didn't see in mine.
[00:59:09.228 --> 00:59:11.128]  They just released that again, like, five years ago.
[00:59:11.648 --> 00:59:12.909]  Yeah, hey, listen, one more thing.
[00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:16.190]  You know, you talked a lot about... Oh, is that the one Rockefeller Titan?
[00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:17.210]  I forget, I read another one.
[00:59:17.250 --> 00:59:17.730]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:59:18.930 --> 00:59:23.792]  You talk a lot about the, you know, the elite's view of, you know, the lower class.
[00:59:24.759 --> 00:59:29.080]  Oh, they write in these robust books, look at the idiot slaves, all they like is sports.
[00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:38.003]  I remember the National Banking Association a hundred years ago saying, remember people are too smart, we've got to finance sports, get it in schools, so the kids aren't involved.
[00:59:38.303 --> 00:59:40.424]  I mean, they are sick, man, they are sick freaks.
[00:59:41.024 --> 00:59:41.904]  Yeah, J.D.
[00:59:42.104 --> 00:59:53.668]  III goes to Bangkok, and he talks about seeing, he sees all these poor people, just masses of them in the streets, and there's an interesting quote where he just stands there and he looks around,
[00:59:54.472 --> 00:59:56.833]  And he says, uh, well, this is the problem.
[00:59:57.453 --> 01:00:00.515]  This is in the chapter on eugenics, the chapter on population control.
[01:00:00.815 --> 01:00:02.795]  So he sees it, you know, like you said, we're bugs.
[01:00:02.975 --> 01:00:09.878]  Now again, this is an authorized biography, but the average person knows what Bevo is.
[01:00:10.438 --> 01:00:13.080]  You don't know, you're calling from Tennessee, that's the cow they worship around here.
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:20.663]  They know what that is, but they don't know the rich men say they want to kill us, and that they want to do it through vaccines.
[01:00:21.283 --> 01:00:23.644]  We just trust them, and oh, inject me, oh!
[01:00:24.366 --> 01:00:25.087]  Oh, I love you.
[01:00:40.266 --> 01:00:51.834]  I'm begging you, learned listeners who are informed and involved, there are so many books written or authorized about these people where they openly say all this, the public hardly even knows what books are now.
[01:00:52.294 --> 01:00:58.879]  But they do read some, the mainline public, I'm serious, less than 4% reads books, but they do read news stories.
[01:00:59.452 --> 01:01:07.138]  And so if you could just dryly what it was like reading and get right into quotes, some of your own thoughts, get quotes up and say a Part 2 is coming with your analysis.
[01:01:07.178 --> 01:01:07.599]  I don't care.
[01:01:07.899 --> 01:01:15.365]  Pull the quotes, get them to Paul Watson, get them to Aaron at InfoWars.com, get them to Trey at InfoWars.com, get them to Mike at InfoWars.com.
[01:01:15.745 --> 01:01:18.547]  Let us get this up for people because I can't do it all.
[01:01:18.647 --> 01:01:19.288]  I'm begging
[01:01:20.228 --> 01:01:27.311]  You know, on the forum, on the PrisonPlanet.tv forum, the PrisonPlanet.com forum, we have an area for submissions and articles.
[01:01:27.331 --> 01:01:28.272]  A lot of great stuff there.
[01:01:28.492 --> 01:01:36.655]  There's so many great articles being written by our listeners now that I don't even have time to read them all, much less get them all posted on the PrisonPlanet or InfoWars.com site proper.
[01:01:36.895 --> 01:01:37.896]  But I salute you.
[01:01:37.936 --> 01:01:40.417]  Any other demon-ish quotes or things you'd like to read?
[01:01:41.477 --> 01:01:42.698]  There's too many, Alex.
[01:01:43.058 --> 01:01:43.758]  We've got hundreds.
[01:01:43.778 --> 01:01:44.839]  Chapter 29, really interesting.
[01:01:48.646 --> 01:01:52.568]  It gets into the cousins, the more recent Rockefeller family members, and Abby.
[01:01:53.929 --> 01:01:55.510]  Abby bankrolls feminism.
[01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:58.712]  She's there at the very first feminist meeting in America.
[01:01:58.973 --> 01:02:03.595]  And the CIA then bankrolls it to break up the family and make sure the women work so the government can have the children?
[01:02:03.635 --> 01:02:04.456]  Is it to say that?
[01:02:04.636 --> 01:02:05.597]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:02:05.677 --> 01:02:14.242]  Listen, you've talked a lot about how this mindset is actually a rebellion against our own species, our own nature.
[01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.084]  And listen, it talks, Abby says that
[01:02:17.788 --> 01:02:20.629]  She couldn't stand her own femininity.
[01:02:20.669 --> 01:02:29.333]  She had to dress like a man, which is interesting because feminism is supposed to exalt... My friend, I've got to get to the other callers.
[01:02:29.493 --> 01:02:32.034]  Tell you what, put him on hold, because he keeps calling in.
[01:02:32.074 --> 01:02:34.515]  I remember reading those quotes myself and never doing anything with it.
[01:02:34.935 --> 01:02:35.535]  Put him on hold.
[01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:38.877]  I'm going to grovel during the break and tell him to hurry up and get that to me.
[01:02:39.217 --> 01:02:44.839]  I'm going to have to move quicker, okay, because we've got people from Canada, England, Florida, Atlanta, Pennsylvania.
[01:02:45.159 --> 01:02:45.659]  Stay with us.
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:46.700]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:02:54.902 --> 01:03:00.326]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:00.727 --> 01:03:08.353]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.048 --> 01:03:16.112]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:16.513 --> 01:03:27.899]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police forgery, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:31.902]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.182 --> 01:03:34.063]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:34.463 --> 01:03:38.306]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:03:51.391 --> 01:03:53.652]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[01:03:54.032 --> 01:04:04.016]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[01:04:04.496 --> 01:04:10.038]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[01:04:10.098 --> 01:04:16.781]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[01:04:17.281 --> 01:04:19.282]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[01:04:20.228 --> 01:04:27.334]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[01:04:27.714 --> 01:04:33.519]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle-class citizens and discouraging savings.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:38.543]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[01:04:38.984 --> 01:04:41.526]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[01:04:42.006 --> 01:04:44.147]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[01:04:45.667 --> 01:04:49.688]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[01:04:50.088 --> 01:04:52.128]  Goodbye.
[01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:55.329]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:04:55.729 --> 01:05:00.730]  If you're going into a battle, and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:05:01.070 --> 01:05:02.811]  My answer would be, all I can get.
[01:05:03.131 --> 01:05:07.892]  In the battle for freedom, and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:05:07.892 --> 01:05:08.212]  I don't know.
[01:05:26.067 --> 01:05:27.748]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:05:54.907 --> 01:05:56.388]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[01:05:56.728 --> 01:06:00.550]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:06:01.011 --> 01:06:03.192]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:06:03.632 --> 01:06:06.954]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:06:07.354 --> 01:06:09.816]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:06:10.336 --> 01:06:11.377]  What's that name again?
[01:06:11.777 --> 01:06:12.957]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:06:13.338 --> 01:06:14.518]  It's CalX.
[01:06:14.899 --> 01:06:16.760]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.941]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:06:19.722 --> 01:06:28.348]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:06:28.768 --> 01:06:34.492]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing CalX ointment.
[01:06:34.892 --> 01:06:46.000]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Phyllo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:06:46.667 --> 01:06:47.768]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[01:06:48.088 --> 01:06:48.769]  I'll be right back.
[01:06:48.889 --> 01:06:50.630]  I'm getting some callux for my heels.
[01:06:55.314 --> 01:06:57.696]  Are you tired of searching for great talk radio?
[01:06:57.776 --> 01:06:58.977]  Well, search no more.
[01:06:59.057 --> 01:07:01.319]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.261 --> 01:07:05.622]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:06.203 --> 01:07:07.484]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:07.544 --> 01:07:11.327]  Dismantling the false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:11.934 --> 01:07:13.295]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:13.855 --> 01:07:17.057]  That's right, they control you with left-right systems.
[01:07:17.577 --> 01:07:22.941]  In the name of liberalism, they point out all of our differences and get us to identify by those.
[01:07:22.981 --> 01:07:29.164]  They make our heroes some drug addict football player, basketball player, some NASCAR driver.
[01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:39.971]  Instead of what they were when this country was number one, sharpshooters, heroes, scientists, inventors, explorers, trailblazers.
[01:07:40.911 --> 01:07:45.735]  Because we idolize and then model ourselves after that.
[01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:53.161]  You think, I remember reading globalist documents from a hundred plus years ago where they said, these people can all read, they're too smart, they're too aggressive.
[01:07:53.181 --> 01:07:56.004]  4% of them have half the world's wealth, they have all the inventions.
[01:07:56.284 --> 01:07:58.146]  We were Americans, we were the best.
[01:07:58.386 --> 01:07:59.547]  Folks, we're not the best now.
[01:07:59.567 --> 01:08:00.688]  Let me give you a little news flash.
[01:08:01.448 --> 01:08:04.371]  We became decadent and slovenly and they took control of us.
[01:08:05.405 --> 01:08:06.426]  They are the New World Order.
[01:08:06.626 --> 01:08:08.147]  They understand what makes us tick.
[01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.149]  They understand our human dynamic.
[01:08:10.449 --> 01:08:16.113]  And they manipulate that by becoming conscious of it and realizing how ignorant we've all become.
[01:08:16.474 --> 01:08:17.214]  Myself included.
[01:08:17.254 --> 01:08:18.375]  I study constantly.
[01:08:18.395 --> 01:08:23.199]  I, graciously, am just so excited about life and all the incredible knowledge and the mysteries.
[01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:26.121]  You need to get into that as well, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:26.521 --> 01:08:28.603]  You need to realize there's more out there than just
[01:08:29.173 --> 01:08:35.380]  You know, they put women on TV that most women can't look like to make you feel inadequate so they can sell you a bunch of junk products.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:42.527]  They show men images of male virtue that are not truly virtuous or that are distorted.
[01:08:43.188 --> 01:08:45.630]  They are manipulating your mind!
[01:08:45.991 --> 01:08:47.292]  Become conscious of it!
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:53.984]  But they've done a preconditioning brainwashing, where you go, there is no manipulation, there is no corruption, there is no lie.
[01:08:54.324 --> 01:08:58.327]  Or another preconditioning, if you're a little bit deeper, okay, nothing you can do about it, so what?
[01:08:58.507 --> 01:09:00.548]  You know, a nihilistic snickering mode.
[01:09:01.449 --> 01:09:07.153]  You're not going to be happy until you put yourself on the course of standing up for what's true, and what's decent, and what's good.
[01:09:07.353 --> 01:09:09.234]  And I'm telling you, that isn't the system we're in now.
[01:09:09.514 --> 01:09:12.016]  Okay, we've got a bunch of calls about the Browns here, been holding for eons.
[01:09:12.576 --> 01:09:15.338]  For those that don't know, I'll throw in a little bit of history here.
[01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:19.119]  The Browns are found guilty of not paying income tax.
[01:09:19.199 --> 01:09:23.182]  A dentist and her husband, a contractor.
[01:09:23.502 --> 01:09:24.523]  We've had them on this show.
[01:09:24.543 --> 01:09:25.564]  George Norris had them on.
[01:09:25.584 --> 01:09:28.626]  I think I missed two of George's calls the last two weeks to come on.
[01:09:29.127 --> 01:09:30.928]  Every time I've been missing those calls to come on.
[01:09:31.168 --> 01:09:33.190]  But George told me I'm on for him tonight.
[01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:35.791]  He's filling in for Art Bell to talk about it.
[01:09:35.811 --> 01:09:36.992]  So tonight I should cover that.
[01:09:37.052 --> 01:09:41.075]  But you can't even get into this in a few minutes without doing it justice.
[01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:42.997]  It's the sound bites that are killing us here.
[01:09:43.617 --> 01:09:44.738]  And I want to get into details.
[01:09:46.346 --> 01:09:51.029]  You know, they say without an income tax, how will we have a government and all these wonderful things it does?
[01:09:51.409 --> 01:09:51.929]  That's a joke.
[01:09:53.130 --> 01:09:55.131]  We didn't have an income tax until 1913.
[01:09:56.572 --> 01:09:58.013]  Most people didn't pay it until the early 1950s.
[01:09:58.033 --> 01:10:01.015]  None of this country was built by it.
[01:10:01.055 --> 01:10:03.376]  The parasitic private banks set that up.
[01:10:03.536 --> 01:10:05.838]  Go learn about fractional reserve banking.
[01:10:06.598 --> 01:10:06.878]  Okay?
[01:10:06.898 --> 01:10:08.199]  Learn about the history of the system.
[01:10:08.239 --> 01:10:10.720]  Learn about how our banking system operates now.
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:11.561]  It's not free market.
[01:10:12.794 --> 01:10:13.736]  Learn about this now.
[01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.021]  It is a crony system.
[01:10:16.102 --> 01:10:17.024]  It is a managed market.
[01:10:18.709 --> 01:10:22.392]  With an elite that literally owns the issuance of currency and credit.
[01:10:23.813 --> 01:10:28.657]  The financial market you're in is real, but it is a toy inside a snow globe, basically.
[01:10:28.977 --> 01:10:30.418]  It's a machine.
[01:10:30.979 --> 01:10:33.060]  You're not looking outside the box, folks.
[01:10:33.501 --> 01:10:34.762]  You're in a matrix, okay?
[01:10:35.322 --> 01:10:35.762]  Literally!
[01:10:35.782 --> 01:10:37.484]  This is what drives me insane!
[01:10:37.684 --> 01:10:39.325]  And they call you dumb!
[01:10:39.505 --> 01:10:41.687]  They snicker and laugh at you constantly!
[01:10:41.947 --> 01:10:42.808]  I'm sick of them!
[01:10:42.828 --> 01:10:44.989]  Alright, I said I'd go to the calls.
[01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:46.731]  They got raided Friday.
[01:10:47.936 --> 01:10:49.256]  Or Thursday night, excuse me.
[01:10:50.137 --> 01:10:52.337]  And I gotta say, I'm glad I didn't get killed.
[01:10:52.977 --> 01:10:57.299]  The Feds came in posing as patriots and got guns on them and got them out of there and didn't kill them.
[01:10:57.799 --> 01:11:00.920]  And that isn't the best, but it's not the worst thing that could have happened.
[01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:07.442]  And I didn't want the Feds getting killed or hurt either, because then they'd make them martyrs and it doesn't hurt the New World Order for some Feds to get killed.
[01:11:07.462 --> 01:11:09.342]  They're just like the general public in the Matrix.
[01:11:10.142 --> 01:11:12.923]  And I'm just glad that this ended non-violently.
[01:11:13.063 --> 01:11:15.764]  I'm not glad that innocent people have gone to prison now.
[01:11:16.661 --> 01:11:25.415]  And I'm not glad they're trumping up charges out of that whole process when the illegal aliens under the amnesty bill were going to be given five years tax amnesty.
[01:11:26.096 --> 01:11:27.579]  But citizens can't have that.
[01:11:28.644 --> 01:11:29.645]  Oh, that's so sick.
[01:11:29.825 --> 01:11:32.986]  But let's go ahead and talk to Joe in New York.
[01:11:33.446 --> 01:11:34.967]  Joe, say you're a friend of the Browns.
[01:11:34.987 --> 01:11:35.547]  What's going on?
[01:11:35.847 --> 01:11:36.648]  What's going on, Alex?
[01:11:36.768 --> 01:11:39.189]  I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener now.
[01:11:39.249 --> 01:11:42.250]  Listen, I was up at the Summer Freedom Festival at the Browns.
[01:11:42.290 --> 01:11:48.733]  I had a great chance to meet Ed Nolay and other patriots of this country, such as Danny Riley, Randy Weaver, Bob Wolfe, and Jason Garrett.
[01:11:48.813 --> 01:11:50.514]  I understand, but we've got to move faster.
[01:11:50.874 --> 01:12:04.863]  All right, sir, basically what I wanted to say is, you know, I sent off two faxes to Marshall Monier, and I basically, you know, keep bringing up the Tom Cryer case, and I can't believe that people aren't screaming hi to the helts every time the knee and the browns are brought up that Tom Cryer got off and was acquitted on all these charges.
[01:12:05.103 --> 01:12:11.728]  Well, not just Tom Cryer in Louisiana, a lawyer, proving that it was all basically a private fraud and an offshore scam.
[01:12:12.188 --> 01:12:16.671]  In case after case, there are just nine defendants in Las Vegas.
[01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:17.091]  Yes, sir.
[01:12:17.231 --> 01:12:19.513]  Under a hundred and, what, ninety-something?
[01:12:20.694 --> 01:12:21.454]  161 federal charges.
[01:12:21.494 --> 01:12:22.795]  I think it's more than that now, though.
[01:12:22.815 --> 01:12:23.476]  I was corrected.
[01:12:24.617 --> 01:12:28.259]  The AP said 160-something, but I'm told that from Cryer it was even higher.
[01:12:28.279 --> 01:12:30.881]  And so, yes, that's why.
[01:12:31.141 --> 01:12:35.865]  But see, I'd like to expose the fraudulent system that way, not in a shootout.
[01:12:37.106 --> 01:12:37.506]  Absolutely.
[01:12:37.546 --> 01:12:42.630]  Well, the thing that I think went bad with, you know, when Ed was sitting around the fire talking, there were probably some undercover federal agents there,
[01:12:43.248 --> 01:12:47.270]  And he was really pushing the escalation with the militia connection that's come in time.
[01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:48.731]  Which is not the way to go.
[01:12:48.791 --> 01:12:52.652]  Listen, you go to those militia things, half of them are feds that are trying to provocateur.
[01:12:53.513 --> 01:12:53.833]  Okay?
[01:12:53.913 --> 01:13:01.936]  It is not going to hurt the New World Order if all the feds in the world were thrown into the Lake of Fire tomorrow.
[01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:03.957]  It is not going to help bring down the New World Order.
[01:13:05.078 --> 01:13:05.398]  Okay?
[01:13:05.498 --> 01:13:06.879]  It is evil in man's heart.
[01:13:06.959 --> 01:13:07.999]  It is an evil system.
[01:13:08.039 --> 01:13:08.880]  It is corruption.
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:09.720]  It is ignorance.
[01:13:10.623 --> 01:13:12.164]  And I hear you and I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:13:12.585 --> 01:13:14.246]  And yes, we've done tap shows.
[01:13:14.486 --> 01:13:21.792]  I had one of the lawyers, I had the lawyer who defended Tom Cryer, Larry Brekraft, on for an hour last week.
[01:13:22.292 --> 01:13:23.774]  So we are covering this subject.
[01:13:24.714 --> 01:13:27.156]  Let's go ahead and take another call on the Browns here.
[01:13:27.176 --> 01:13:36.584]  You can go to presentplanet.com, read our coverage of it, and watch the press conference from Friday with the federal marshal, head federal marshal there, Monier.
[01:13:37.645 --> 01:13:39.126]  You're on the air from
[01:13:40.137 --> 01:13:41.438]  Florida, George, go ahead.
[01:13:42.138 --> 01:13:45.641]  Well, Alex, I like listening to your show and watching football.
[01:13:46.842 --> 01:13:47.302]  That's great.
[01:13:47.762 --> 01:13:49.864]  What's on your mind?
[01:13:49.884 --> 01:13:57.529]  There's a video going around MySpace about you throwing We Are Change under the bus and the Browns under the bus that you went back.
[01:13:58.530 --> 01:13:58.890]  Listen.
[01:14:01.392 --> 01:14:02.453]  All right, folks.
[01:14:02.713 --> 01:14:07.937]  Let's try to move on to some more of the phone calls here and get into some serious issues.
[01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:13.457]  Let us now go ahead and take another call here.
[01:14:14.919 --> 01:14:17.622]  Let us talk to Mark in Pennsylvania.
[01:14:17.762 --> 01:14:18.683]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:14:18.743 --> 01:14:19.104]  Welcome.
[01:14:20.646 --> 01:14:21.446]  I'm in Atlanta.
[01:14:21.507 --> 01:14:22.187]  Thank you, brother.
[01:14:22.287 --> 01:14:22.988]  Okay, welcome.
[01:14:23.088 --> 01:14:23.429]  Go ahead.
[01:14:23.469 --> 01:14:24.710]  It just says Pennsylvania here.
[01:14:24.730 --> 01:14:25.731]  That's fine.
[01:14:25.771 --> 01:14:26.372]  My name is Mark.
[01:14:26.452 --> 01:14:30.377]  I'm in Atlanta, and I came across some people with a 25-year record
[01:14:31.019 --> 01:14:34.680]  That once they go through this procedure, it's like the maze of the minotaur.
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:36.661]  I forget the name of the Greek hero.
[01:14:36.741 --> 01:14:40.302]  He laid out a starlet thread so he could find his way back out.
[01:14:40.702 --> 01:14:41.982]  That's what these people have done.
[01:14:42.323 --> 01:14:51.926]  In the 25 years since they came, a lot of research found out you can un-volunteer, but it's not just as simple as... You've got to remember this.
[01:14:52.066 --> 01:14:53.546]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[01:14:54.486 --> 01:14:55.967]  This is the big problem.
[01:14:56.587 --> 01:14:59.368]  This is the big problem with Patriot Radio.
[01:15:00.211 --> 01:15:01.372]  And that's not what I do here.
[01:15:01.432 --> 01:15:04.593]  I do news and information and philosophy and analysis.
[01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:23.421]  Is that people call in, and they go immediately to the most complex issues, or immediately to factionalization, which will faction in the anti-New World Order movement they're in, instead of communicating the basic message.
[01:15:24.352 --> 01:15:26.795]  Our country was taken over by private corporations in 1913.
[01:15:27.275 --> 01:15:29.938]  They've been expanding that control.
[01:15:30.538 --> 01:15:32.680]  They're now setting up a world government.
[01:15:33.121 --> 01:15:34.282]  They're very evil.
[01:15:35.663 --> 01:15:38.626]  They're staging these wars to demonize the U.S.'
[01:15:38.586 --> 01:15:40.468]  's name, or a lot, amongst other reasons.
[01:15:40.488 --> 01:15:42.030]  We'll come back, take more calls.
[01:15:42.050 --> 01:15:44.352]  I'm going to get into the brief history of the New World Order.
[01:15:44.392 --> 01:15:46.094]  For those who don't know what it is, stay with us.
[01:15:52.899 --> 01:16:01.966]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:16:02.207 --> 01:16:13.436]  Black murky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:16:13.776 --> 01:16:18.600]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:18.960]  I think?
[01:16:37.822 --> 01:16:38.162]  Let's get it!
[01:16:52.243 --> 01:16:52.924]  It's a fact.
[01:16:53.184 --> 01:17:00.728]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[01:17:00.908 --> 01:17:09.432]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, all debt has become mathematically impossible to repay, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:20.318]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[01:17:20.578 --> 01:17:26.683]  We can terminate your unsecure debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[01:17:26.903 --> 01:17:31.967]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[01:17:32.147 --> 01:17:36.670]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[01:17:36.830 --> 01:17:38.572]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[01:17:38.712 --> 01:17:38.972]  That's 877-943-8600.
[01:17:38.992 --> 01:17:39.512]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[01:17:39.532 --> 01:17:41.414]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:54.261]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:17:54.401 --> 01:18:01.102]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:18:01.362 --> 01:18:09.524]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:18:09.744 --> 01:18:15.466]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:18:15.646 --> 01:18:17.427]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:18:17.488 --> 01:18:19.649]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:18:19.789 --> 01:18:24.073]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:18:24.213 --> 01:18:26.355]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:18:26.435 --> 01:18:34.201]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:18:34.241 --> 01:18:34.721]  We're good.
[01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:54.951]  Is credit card debt making your life stressful?
[01:18:55.291 --> 01:18:58.592]  Do you avoid answering the phone in fear of another creditor calling?
[01:18:58.612 --> 01:19:02.394]  How would you like to cut your credit card balances by as much as half?
[01:19:02.794 --> 01:19:03.834]  Well, now you can!

[01:19:44.852 --> 01:19:46.313]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:19:46.373 --> 01:19:47.174]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:20:10.845 --> 01:20:11.146]  Yeah.
[01:20:15.423 --> 01:20:28.746]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-590-5525, 877-590-KLBJ, after our namesake here that we broadcast out of in association with MS Communications and GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:28.786 --> 01:20:40.328]  Locally, if you're listening to us in Texas, 836-0590, or if you're listening in stations like KCXL in Kansas City, or stations around the country, or on Global Shortwave, or on satellite, all the ships at sea.
[01:20:40.388 --> 01:20:44.669]  I get letters from McMurdle Weather Station in Antarctica on the bottom of the planet.
[01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:50.631]  To everybody, we say, we love you.
[01:20:50.651 --> 01:20:54.353]  That's what it basically comes down to, and we're glad that you're tuning in and putting up with us.
[01:20:54.793 --> 01:21:00.195]  You know, I rarely use the delay button here, and we don't screen your calls when you call in here.
[01:21:01.255 --> 01:21:03.116]  If you want to tell us what you're talking about, that's fine.
[01:21:03.136 --> 01:21:04.937]  If you want to tell us where you're calling from, that's fine.
[01:21:05.317 --> 01:21:07.077]  You can say you're calling from Pluto, if you wish.
[01:21:07.418 --> 01:21:13.440]  But once somebody gets on air, either regurgitating COINTELPRO or
[01:21:15.763 --> 01:21:18.426]  Actually involved in COINTELPRO, I just hang up on them now.
[01:21:18.946 --> 01:21:20.408]  I just don't involve myself in it.
[01:21:20.428 --> 01:21:32.719]  You know, this guy called up and said, well I hear you threw the Browns under the bus and you threw some other, you know, prominent Patriot group under the bus and now you're bad.
[01:21:34.121 --> 01:21:38.765]  Well, A, you have to remember, see Patriots, a lot of them live in their own little bitty worlds.
[01:21:39.815 --> 01:21:44.117]  They don't realize there's a bigger planet and people that don't know about everything they know.
[01:21:44.458 --> 01:21:47.459]  And some little, you know, tiny thing that's happening somewhere.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:52.062]  So you have to educate people about what you're talking about first.
[01:21:54.403 --> 01:22:03.888]  And so, A, from the start, I would say on air, probably not a good idea the Browns are getting on air and saying that when they see someone move in the woods, they just shoot in the woods.
[01:22:04.597 --> 01:22:06.979]  Now again, most listeners just tuned in, and what are the Browns?
[01:22:07.279 --> 01:22:12.562]  Family in New Hampshire, quote, tax protesters, held up saying they were going to have a fire fight.
[01:22:12.582 --> 01:22:13.342]  The Feds came to get them.
[01:22:13.362 --> 01:22:13.983]  Remember that group?
[01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:19.406]  The Feds were going to move in, and we tried to get the word out and hopefully avert anything violent happening.
[01:22:20.387 --> 01:22:24.049]  And the Browns got the majority of their support on my show, 80 plus percent of it.
[01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:31.854]  But I was not going to get on air and support, as a lot of talk show hosts did, mowing the Feds down and
[01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:35.351]  Because believe me, they'd come arrest me, A. You wouldn't hear Alex anymore.
[01:22:36.011 --> 01:22:36.271]  Okay?
[01:22:36.331 --> 01:22:40.613]  I mean, that's A. B. It's not a good idea to call for violence.
[01:22:41.033 --> 01:22:45.276]  The globalists have to stage terror attacks and violence, provocateur it to blame it on us.
[01:22:46.716 --> 01:22:47.557]  And their other enemies.
[01:22:47.617 --> 01:22:50.919]  We don't need to be involved in it ourselves unless it's in defending ourselves.
[01:22:52.299 --> 01:22:55.181]  And then C. If feds got killed, it would turn them into martyrs.
[01:22:56.585 --> 01:22:57.125]  And you bet.
[01:22:57.345 --> 01:23:00.106]  They were having picnics, inviting children and families out there.
[01:23:00.466 --> 01:23:02.307]  And I said, folks, that place is surrounded by feds.
[01:23:02.327 --> 01:23:03.427]  They could move in there any time.
[01:23:03.748 --> 01:23:06.529]  If you're going to go out there, that's one thing, but don't bring your children out there.
[01:23:07.629 --> 01:23:09.690]  Oh, you dirty coward, Alex!
[01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:11.490]  Let's bring our kids out there.
[01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:17.813]  Then the Homeland Security helicopter's flying at 30 feet right above the trees, about to fly into people, which was horrible of the feds.
[01:23:18.693 --> 01:23:19.113]  Criminal.
[01:23:19.633 --> 01:23:21.734]  Violates every federal law on aviation.
[01:23:22.924 --> 01:23:23.384]  Doesn't matter.
[01:23:23.424 --> 01:23:25.045]  You put your kids in harm's way.
[01:23:25.345 --> 01:23:26.726]  I mean, this is serious stuff.
[01:23:26.746 --> 01:23:29.587]  You don't bring children to a potential war zone.
[01:23:30.708 --> 01:23:32.208]  I mean, I have a job here.
[01:23:32.608 --> 01:23:40.952]  You know how much money I get offered by all the quacks in the Patriot Movement to sell magic machines that fire out Dragonian laser beams or something to heal you?
[01:23:40.972 --> 01:23:46.335]  You know how much money I've turned down as I won't sell magic jelly beans that'll cure cancer?
[01:23:46.915 --> 01:23:49.236]  Or magical creams that'll heal what ails you?
[01:23:49.256 --> 01:23:51.137]  Or other sundry snake oils?
[01:23:52.108 --> 01:24:01.112]  You know, just because the New World Order and the Establishment is rotten to the core doesn't mean that everybody else in the world's got all the answers.
[01:24:01.432 --> 01:24:03.933]  See, I want you to check out what I say.
[01:24:04.893 --> 01:24:08.535]  I tell you David Rockefeller wrote his memoir saying he wants to destroy U.S.
[01:24:08.575 --> 01:24:11.336]  sovereignty and destroy the dollar and all this other stuff.
[01:24:11.576 --> 01:24:15.378]  You can go buy the book written by him where he says it.
[01:24:16.266 --> 01:24:18.507]  Then you can find out he's the chairman of Chase Manhattan.
[01:24:18.727 --> 01:24:21.508]  You can find out he literally gave the land they built the U.N.
[01:24:21.648 --> 01:24:21.728]  on.
[01:24:21.989 --> 01:24:22.829]  You can find out.
[01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:28.231]  See, I talk about issues, not weird hillbilly infighting.
[01:24:28.271 --> 01:24:29.232]  And that's hillbillies, man.
[01:24:29.252 --> 01:24:30.852]  They fight with the guy over the next hill.
[01:24:31.193 --> 01:24:32.893]  This ain't hillbilly radio, baby.
[01:24:33.754 --> 01:24:34.994]  I'm here to fight the New World Order.
[01:24:35.014 --> 01:24:36.115]  I'm here to get stuff done.
[01:24:37.215 --> 01:24:41.377]  But I had to hang up on the guy and to lay him out, because there's no point in letting him put out his COINTELPRO.
[01:24:41.397 --> 01:24:42.117]  What's COINTELPRO?
[01:24:42.137 --> 01:24:43.278]  That was an FBI program.
[01:24:44.230 --> 01:25:00.861]  Every time blacks or other groups in the 60s would get together and really start feeding homeless in soup kitchens and getting communities together and getting kids off welfare systems and the like that are getting kids out of crime, they'd come in and radicalize until one black leader or the other black leader is talking bad about you and get those two fighting.
[01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:12.761]  And they do that over and over again so call up and say, he said another group that I really helped push and give national attention and now they got all these chappers all over the country and that's great I'll just leave it alone and let it grow.
[01:25:13.221 --> 01:25:16.705]  Call up, I hear you threw him under the bus too!
[01:25:18.007 --> 01:25:20.888]  And then people start asking, I hear something was thrown over the bus, something was thrown over the bus.
[01:25:21.148 --> 01:25:22.908]  And then other chapters don't form.
[01:25:23.008 --> 01:25:25.509]  More independent groups don't begin.
[01:25:25.929 --> 01:25:32.531]  And we don't defeat the New World Order, and they get to carry out their more staged terror attacks, bring in their world government.
[01:25:33.231 --> 01:25:46.034]  And then meanwhile, most Patriot shows you hear on the radio are unintelligible and un-understandable by the general dumbed-down public, because they're hearing this and it's like we're talking about some ball game and they don't even know what the game is.
[01:25:47.150 --> 01:25:48.973]  That's another object of COINTELPRO.
[01:25:50.596 --> 01:25:53.422]  You see, to get us all... That's another thing they do.
[01:25:53.442 --> 01:25:57.289]  And they've been caught doing this for over a hundred years.
[01:25:58.243 --> 01:26:01.706]  Globalist, British intelligence, German intelligence, CIA, FBI.
[01:26:02.226 --> 01:26:07.210]  They will try to get somebody who's on radio, TV, newsprint, to attack a specific group.
[01:26:07.731 --> 01:26:18.239]  If you're making headway, exposing corrupt government, exposing corrupt corporations, trying to push an agenda of liberty and freedom and more transparency in government, they'll try to corner you into attacking a group.
[01:26:18.559 --> 01:26:25.184]  To say it's the Jews, or it's the Catholics, or it's the Protestants, or it's the blacks, or it's the this or that.
[01:26:25.625 --> 01:26:27.226]  And then once they've got you there,
[01:26:27.952 --> 01:26:36.196]  You see, then they can pin you down on one issue, and then that isolates you from all these other groups that would listen to what you had to say and what you had to do.
[01:26:36.216 --> 01:26:40.599]  I mean, the Romans figured this out 2,200 years ago.
[01:26:40.979 --> 01:26:43.620]  The Babylonians figured this out 3,000 years ago.
[01:26:43.881 --> 01:26:45.021]  The Egyptians figured it out.
[01:26:45.061 --> 01:26:46.142]  It's statecraft.
[01:26:46.542 --> 01:26:57.528]  And you've got a defenseless public whose mind is full of ball games and mindless fluff, who can't even balance their own checkbooks, who can't fill out deposit slips, who can't
[01:26:59.045 --> 01:27:00.747]  Last night I talked about being an IMAX.
[01:27:00.827 --> 01:27:07.474]  I've never seen people at IMAX think that the trash can was the bin to put their, you know, their non-disposable 3D glasses in.
[01:27:07.494 --> 01:27:09.516]  I try to tell them and I just felt foolish.
[01:27:09.957 --> 01:27:10.898]  I'm not supposed to do that.
[01:27:10.978 --> 01:27:12.159]  Cattle don't want to talk.
[01:27:12.199 --> 01:27:14.862]  They're in a TV REM sleep state.
[01:27:14.882 --> 01:27:15.583]  That's scientific.
[01:27:15.623 --> 01:27:16.183]  That's admitted.
[01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:17.304]  Major studies.
[01:27:17.324 --> 01:27:20.448]  They're literally walking around as zombies and they're not thinking.
[01:27:20.888 --> 01:27:24.712]  Because you watch a couple hours of TV a day, folks, you start changing your brain wave pattern.
[01:27:24.892 --> 01:27:29.677]  They're literally in a sleepwalking mesmerized, and they're just throwing their glasses in the trash can.
[01:27:29.918 --> 01:27:31.119]  Hey guys, the Benz over here.
[01:27:31.139 --> 01:27:36.084]  And they just looked up like big people do and just went, kind of like, what's one talking to me?
[01:27:36.264 --> 01:27:38.207]  We're not supposed to talk to people we don't know.
[01:27:38.427 --> 01:27:41.350]  We just oink on off down the street and take our vaccines.
[01:27:42.754 --> 01:27:54.537]  We just eat our lead-drenched, plastic-drenched food and we give it to our styrofoam cups that have all the estrogen in them to over-sexualize our women and turn our boys into girls.
[01:27:55.117 --> 01:27:59.498]  We go ahead and use our cell phones and there's a thousand studies saying they fry our brain.
[01:28:00.278 --> 01:28:09.780]  And if somebody does try to get out on the air and warn people, a thousand schizophrenics call in, gibbering and jabbering about things that don't even matter.
[01:28:11.136 --> 01:28:13.258]  I hear you ain't with my hillbilly group.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.942]  Look, folks, my job is to get you to think.
[01:28:18.022 --> 01:28:25.808]  My job is to get you to look outside the box and not believe me about what you're going to see outside that box.
[01:28:26.088 --> 01:28:28.150]  I'm not telling you what you're going to see outside that box.
[01:28:29.431 --> 01:28:30.772]  I know I got a good idea.
[01:28:30.792 --> 01:28:33.674]  I mean, I've studied it, but everybody's perspective is a little bit different.
[01:28:33.854 --> 01:28:35.075]  It depends on where you are in the world.
[01:28:35.455 --> 01:28:36.876]  But let me tell you, it ain't pretty.
[01:28:37.777 --> 01:28:38.798]  And it's exhilarating.
[01:28:38.818 --> 01:28:40.019]  And again, I was in a movie
[01:28:41.972 --> 01:28:46.955]  An IMAX six months ago and only one person tried to throw their glasses in the trash can.
[01:28:49.237 --> 01:28:50.097]  Now they all do it.
[01:28:50.277 --> 01:28:57.662]  See, and I was talking to a really good writer, a well-known writer the other day, a really smart fella, and he said, no, I'm noticing everyone's becoming zombies.
[01:28:57.702 --> 01:29:01.184]  And everybody who still can think is going, are you noticing they're like zombies?
[01:29:02.785 --> 01:29:04.466]  Everybody's like zombies now.
[01:29:06.447 --> 01:29:09.069]  And I don't... Man, it's scary, folks.
[01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:10.770]  I mean, something's going on.
[01:29:11.793 --> 01:29:12.754]  It's accelerating.
[01:29:12.814 --> 01:29:14.075]  It's getting worse and worse.
[01:29:15.356 --> 01:29:18.398]  And people, you hear them talking at grocery stores, they don't really talk.
[01:29:18.418 --> 01:29:21.521]  They have like little hoops and grunts and monkey noises they make now.
[01:29:22.402 --> 01:29:25.264]  And everything's kind of abbreviated, like Orwell said it would be.
[01:29:25.284 --> 01:29:27.526]  The language is being pared down and reduced.
[01:29:27.606 --> 01:29:29.987]  And people are walking like monkeys now.
[01:29:31.168 --> 01:29:34.911]  And meanwhile, the order lords are just manipulating the datum and the information.
[01:29:34.931 --> 01:29:35.832]  Ha ha ha!
[01:29:36.212 --> 01:29:37.754]  Our plan is going well!
[01:29:38.857 --> 01:29:39.679]  I will take some calls.
[01:29:39.719 --> 01:29:43.965]  I'll get into the globalist, kind of a pared down how they operate and what their master plan is.
[01:29:44.446 --> 01:29:46.109]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:29:46.309 --> 01:29:46.690]  Stay with us.
[01:29:55.066 --> 01:29:55.326]  Of course.
[01:29:55.646 --> 01:29:58.488]  The J. Michael Stevens Group is shipping a lot of storable food.
[01:29:58.988 --> 01:30:01.190]  It's smart that you're getting going at your food supplies.
[01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:10.115]  One week after the report came out that the world had eaten more food than it produced last year, the country turned into a deep freeze, wiping out a huge part of the new crop.
[01:30:10.595 --> 01:30:11.136]  An example?
[01:30:11.676 --> 01:30:14.498]  In 24 hours, clementine oranges doubled in price.
[01:30:15.398 --> 01:30:18.160]  If you intend to start or finish your supply, call immediately.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:21.782]  When you call, tell them how many adults and how many years of food you need.
[01:30:22.563 --> 01:30:27.765]  When there are shortages, missing items will be substituted, maintaining the quantity of food necessary.
[01:30:28.385 --> 01:30:29.866]  Money is not the problem.
[01:30:30.086 --> 01:30:31.107]  Availability is.
[01:30:31.627 --> 01:30:33.467]  Be careful when food supplies get short.
[01:30:33.708 --> 01:30:37.389]  With no future, many retailers ship real trash to supply you.
[01:30:38.009 --> 01:30:40.090]  For safe food you can trust, call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:41.171]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:41.191 --> 01:30:41.231]  800-409-5633.
[01:30:53.314 --> 01:31:04.583]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:31:04.803 --> 01:31:11.248]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:31:11.488 --> 01:31:12.088]  We're good to go!
[01:31:36.505 --> 01:31:38.647]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[01:31:38.687 --> 01:31:39.288]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[01:31:39.388 --> 01:31:41.310]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:42.291]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:31:52.205 --> 01:31:57.689]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:58.129 --> 01:32:02.353]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:32:02.793 --> 01:32:09.638]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:32:10.078 --> 01:32:16.785]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:32:17.105 --> 01:32:18.726]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:32:19.027 --> 01:32:22.210]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:24.932]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:32:25.253 --> 01:32:31.979]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:32:32.399 --> 01:32:35.082]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:32:38.745 --> 01:32:39.146]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:40.947]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:32:51.855 --> 01:32:55.458]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[01:32:55.638 --> 01:32:59.501]  Find the cleanest shop in town where cleaning is top priority.
[01:32:59.701 --> 01:33:03.204]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[01:33:03.584 --> 01:33:11.149]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[01:33:11.450 --> 01:33:14.712]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[01:33:15.152 --> 01:33:18.755]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[01:33:19.035 --> 01:33:20.777]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[01:33:21.855 --> 01:33:24.777]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[01:33:24.797 --> 01:33:26.319]  A tornado under your hood!
[01:33:26.659 --> 01:33:32.303]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[01:33:32.624 --> 01:33:39.789]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles, and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:44.753]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[01:33:44.954 --> 01:33:50.138]  Visit tornadoair.com or go to Pep Boys, NAPA, or AutoZone today.
[01:33:52.692 --> 01:33:57.175]  News, politics, sports, cars, home improvement, health, and everything in between.
[01:33:57.275 --> 01:33:58.176]  We've got you covered.
[01:33:58.216 --> 01:34:09.664]  You're listening to the GCN Radio Network.
[01:34:09.805 --> 01:34:11.906]  Man, that is some depressing music, right?
[01:34:11.946 --> 01:34:12.387]  What is that?
[01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:12.687]  Okay.
[01:34:17.731 --> 01:34:19.032]  That's a request of the intern.
[01:34:19.052 --> 01:34:20.093]  Throw her out the window.
[01:34:20.113 --> 01:34:21.214]  I'm joking.
[01:34:21.394 --> 01:34:22.395]  Alright, let's get serious.
[01:34:22.475 --> 01:34:23.095]  Oh, it's not bad.
[01:34:23.215 --> 01:34:24.556]  I'm just teasing.
[01:34:24.857 --> 01:34:25.797]  Very nice, actually.
[01:34:25.837 --> 01:34:26.658]  It's growing on me.
[01:34:27.399 --> 01:34:28.119]  Look, here's the deal.
[01:34:28.159 --> 01:34:29.981]  I can take these seven phone calls.
[01:34:30.001 --> 01:34:30.821]  I cannot take it.
[01:34:30.841 --> 01:34:32.543]  But if I do it, I've got to do radio graffiti.
[01:34:32.743 --> 01:34:34.304]  But you've got 20-30 seconds apiece.
[01:34:34.364 --> 01:34:35.685]  I've got a news story I want to cover.
[01:34:36.105 --> 01:34:37.206]  I'm creating artificial life.
[01:34:37.246 --> 01:34:37.847]  Declares U.S.
[01:34:37.867 --> 01:34:38.567]  gene pioneer.
[01:34:38.928 --> 01:34:42.170]  Tied into GMO foods and try to go through the brief history of the New World Order.
[01:34:43.131 --> 01:34:44.792]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dave in Canada.
[01:34:44.812 --> 01:34:45.333]  You're on the air.
[01:34:45.373 --> 01:34:45.733]  Go ahead.
[01:34:46.630 --> 01:34:47.451]  Hey, Alex.
[01:34:47.731 --> 01:34:48.172]  Hello, sir.
[01:34:48.272 --> 01:34:48.892]  Thanks for holding.
[01:34:49.513 --> 01:34:50.174]  Yeah, no problem.
[01:34:50.474 --> 01:34:52.476]  It's great to finally talk to you today.
[01:34:52.676 --> 01:35:00.064]  Like you say, we only live once, but never before has the future of all life on Earth depended on the initiative of one generation.
[01:35:00.804 --> 01:35:04.188]  And we have to look at all the aspects of this with an open mind, sir.
[01:35:05.187 --> 01:35:26.985]  The bloodlines controlling this world will continue to keep manipulating us and confusing us on every subject They'll keep suppressing technologies that would stop us from being slaves to the oil industry and now I understand there are environmentalists that are within the you know the government and Those are the ones saying that 80% of us need to die, but it was on the news only once and
[01:35:27.917 --> 01:35:31.201]  Alright, so I've got to move quicker here through the calls.
[01:35:31.261 --> 01:35:32.762]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric.
[01:35:33.243 --> 01:35:34.344]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:35:34.364 --> 01:35:36.026]  Go ahead from Washington.
[01:35:36.046 --> 01:35:37.427]  Hi, I'm calling about the forum.
[01:35:37.447 --> 01:35:40.690]  The Prison Planet Forum.
[01:35:40.770 --> 01:35:41.211]  Okay, go ahead.
[01:35:51.666 --> 01:36:00.389]  Well, I was banned the other day for posting a mild criticism of you and We Are Change and I kind of find... Well, you're not banned now.
[01:36:00.589 --> 01:36:12.033]  I saw here that you wanted to complain on the board, but again, can you imagine listeners listening on AM and AM stations across the country and you're whining about some moderator on our message board banning you?
[01:36:13.108 --> 01:36:14.448]  Number one, we shut that up.
[01:36:14.508 --> 01:36:19.990]  We have people on there, and there's many theft areas to complain and gripe on there.
[01:36:20.770 --> 01:36:22.930]  But if we get trolled or spammed, you get kicked off.
[01:36:23.450 --> 01:36:23.810]  Okay?
[01:36:24.391 --> 01:36:25.711]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:36:25.731 --> 01:36:28.191]  You see how they've trained folks not to even be able to think in our own movement.
[01:36:28.772 --> 01:36:30.472]  Let's go ahead and talk to Art in Florida.
[01:36:30.492 --> 01:36:31.032]  You're on the air.
[01:36:31.072 --> 01:36:31.492]  Go ahead.
[01:36:31.512 --> 01:36:34.033]  Hi Alex, this is Art here in Florida.
[01:36:34.153 --> 01:36:36.933]  I just love your work, and I have a new project for you.
[01:36:37.554 --> 01:36:39.094]  I am the lead plaintiff
[01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:44.754]  In the, uh, for Florida, in the national clean elections lawsuit that's being launched.
[01:36:44.894 --> 01:36:52.040]  Fifty states are suing simultaneously to ensure that we have paper ballots counted in public.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:53.401]  No more vote fraud, in other words.
[01:36:53.701 --> 01:36:53.981]  Yes.
[01:36:54.421 --> 01:37:01.787]  And I, uh, we're developing a long list of plaintiffs from every state, and I want to invite you to become a plaintiff for the state of Texas.
[01:37:02.287 --> 01:37:02.968]  Well, let me do this.
[01:37:03.008 --> 01:37:05.009]  Just call my producer, Trey, on Monday.
[01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:08.332]  Trey at InfoWars.com and get in contact with him that way, sir.
[01:37:08.652 --> 01:37:09.493]  Good to hear from you.
[01:37:10.374 --> 01:37:11.756]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul.
[01:37:11.776 --> 01:37:13.257]  I'm going to have to move quick here, folks.
[01:37:13.437 --> 01:37:15.299]  Paul in San Antonio, Texas.
[01:37:15.779 --> 01:37:26.408]  Hey, Bud, I need your feedback and your opinion on this San Antonio TV preacher who is trying to get us to have a... Well, Hagee, I'm guessing it's Hagee, right?
[01:37:27.249 --> 01:37:35.456]  He's on the board of the Oral Roberts University that's in all that trouble right now.
[01:37:36.486 --> 01:37:50.010]  It turned out that, you know, the fake conservative preacher, who I actually agree with on a lot of issues, I mean, I've been born and raised a Baptist, who just died, Jerry Falwell, with the Israelis paying for a $1.5 million jet aircraft for him and all this stuff.
[01:37:50.551 --> 01:37:52.371]  I mean, they're bought and paid for by foreign interests.
[01:37:52.391 --> 01:37:52.951]  What do you expect?
[01:37:53.932 --> 01:37:57.273]  Well, it just makes me sick, Alex.
[01:37:57.313 --> 01:37:58.253]  Honestly, God.
[01:37:59.053 --> 01:38:01.534]  Well, I mean, look, he's on the board of Oral Roberts University.
[01:38:02.114 --> 01:38:04.635]  I mean, have you read the AP today about all the trouble they're in?
[01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:07.005]  Let me get the headline here for you.
[01:38:07.426 --> 01:38:09.208]  Scandal Brewing at Oral Roberts.
[01:38:09.949 --> 01:38:11.772]  I mean, it's just a nest.
[01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:19.203]  Well, but isn't this whole thing about a preemptive attack on Iran a hell of a lot worse than a few million dollars being diverted?
[01:38:20.877 --> 01:38:21.918]  No, no, I understand.
[01:38:21.998 --> 01:38:25.201]  I'm just saying that what do you expect?
[01:38:25.361 --> 01:38:31.288]  I mean, if people think that's Christianity or that's Protestantism, they've got another thing coming.
[01:38:31.308 --> 01:38:32.169]  It's not.
[01:38:32.789 --> 01:38:36.353]  And again, I like a lot of stuff Hagee says, but it's like rat poison.
[01:38:36.874 --> 01:38:38.876]  98% good, 2% death.
[01:38:39.676 --> 01:38:41.919]  And I've never heard such warmongering in my life.
[01:38:42.634 --> 01:38:47.079]  Meanwhile, it's the globalists running this country who radicalized the Muslims 80 years ago.
[01:38:47.519 --> 01:38:51.723]  Under every Mullah's dress is a Union Jack, as they say.
[01:38:52.184 --> 01:38:53.365]  And folks better find out about it.
[01:38:54.166 --> 01:38:54.586]  You know what?
[01:38:54.606 --> 01:38:56.668]  I think I'm out of time here.
[01:38:56.728 --> 01:38:58.550]  I got caller after caller, endless calls.
[01:38:58.570 --> 01:38:59.431]  I just can't take anymore.
[01:38:59.471 --> 01:39:02.534]  I apologize to William and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:07.673]  I try my best to take your calls, but we're just out of time here, and I said I'd get to this.
[01:39:08.114 --> 01:39:10.556]  I am creating artificial life, declares U.S.
[01:39:10.656 --> 01:39:11.477]  gene pioneer.
[01:39:11.957 --> 01:39:16.261]  Scientist has made synthetic chromosome breakthrough to combat global warming.
[01:39:17.222 --> 01:39:28.572]  Craig Vintner, the controversial DNA researcher involved in the race to decipher the human genetic code, has built a synthetic chromosome out of laboratory chemicals and is poised to announce the creation.
[01:39:29.406 --> 01:39:31.909]  Well, the first new artificial life form on Earth.
[01:39:32.429 --> 01:39:46.544]  The announcement, which is expected within weeks, and should come as early as Monday at the annual meeting of the Scientific Institute in San Diego, California, will herald a giant leap forward in the development of designer genomes.
[01:39:47.125 --> 01:39:49.127]  And he goes on to talk about how they've already created this.
[01:39:49.187 --> 01:39:50.709]  Now they're going to implant it in the bacteria.
[01:39:50.989 --> 01:39:51.950]  That'll be a new life form.
[01:39:54.716 --> 01:40:01.518]  But I've interviewed Nobel Prize winners for genetics on this and they say really it's a fraud that they claim they know now, but it still is a big step.
[01:40:02.658 --> 01:40:06.659]  Claiming they have a human genome is like taking a picture of a human and saying you have that human.
[01:40:06.739 --> 01:40:06.939]  No.
[01:40:07.179 --> 01:40:08.400]  They have a picture of it.
[01:40:08.640 --> 01:40:14.021]  But they claimed arrogantly 20 years ago that 96% of the DNA is junk!
[01:40:15.482 --> 01:40:19.803]  And every bit of genetic code going right back to human development is there.
[01:40:21.284 --> 01:40:23.705]  And it's just unbelievably beautiful.
[01:40:24.165 --> 01:40:27.286]  And billions of times more complex than they first thought.
[01:40:28.406 --> 01:40:33.547]  So what they can do is, they can take, say, a jellyfish gene and put it in a potato, one example.
[01:40:35.268 --> 01:40:39.289]  And they can change that genetic in the potato to make it last a month longer and taste better.
[01:40:40.389 --> 01:40:47.911]  But then it randomly, each time there's a new generation of the potato, randomly will change thousands of things, and generally changes
[01:40:49.179 --> 01:40:58.824]  The amino acids in the potato, to being different than the 54 or whatever there are, to new ones that have never existed in all of plant animal life on this planet.
[01:41:00.185 --> 01:41:06.848]  This miracle, this beautiful jewel, this phantasm of possibility and incredible handiwork.
[01:41:08.422 --> 01:41:22.245]  And so they give, so they feed the potatoes to the rats 15 years ago, and it was a top geneticist in England I've interviewed, Nobel Prize winner, just one of them I interviewed, and then half the rats died, the other half had mutations after birth, which they thought was impossible.
[01:41:22.305 --> 01:41:25.766]  Mutations don't happen except, you know, during development in the fetus.
[01:41:26.806 --> 01:41:28.266]  I mean, this is new stuff.
[01:41:28.646 --> 01:41:29.386]  Deadly poison.
[01:41:30.126 --> 01:41:32.207]  And that's why it causes other allergens.
[01:41:32.227 --> 01:41:37.468]  You eat allergenic food because of the genetic manipulations, and then everything else makes you allergic.
[01:41:38.115 --> 01:41:40.296]  And now the feds say, oh, you want to eat organic food.
[01:41:40.336 --> 01:41:40.936]  You want choice.
[01:41:40.956 --> 01:41:43.418]  We'll just let them certify inorganic food as organic.
[01:41:44.478 --> 01:41:48.380]  75% of it can be inorganic or a manipulation, but we'll still certify it.
[01:41:50.101 --> 01:41:51.882]  See, and they changed that a year and a half ago.
[01:41:52.782 --> 01:41:53.883]  It's so deadly.
[01:41:54.203 --> 01:41:56.224]  And there's literally hundreds and hundreds of studies.
[01:41:56.244 --> 01:41:57.145]  This is not my opinion.
[01:41:57.345 --> 01:42:01.847]  And national hosts get up and are deceptive and go, George Washington Carver?
[01:42:02.627 --> 01:42:05.649]  He changed, you know,
[01:42:06.656 --> 01:42:10.861]  Soybeans, he changed peanuts by cross-breeding them.
[01:42:10.961 --> 01:42:11.161]  No, no, no.
[01:42:11.181 --> 01:42:16.006]  That's like taking two different breeds of dogs and manipulating their genetics through the genetics you have.
[01:42:17.007 --> 01:42:24.996]  With what's happening with chimera cross-species and many other nightmare systems, is they're splicing them together.
[01:42:25.917 --> 01:42:27.699]  Two different families.
[01:42:28.951 --> 01:42:32.814]  And they're actually turning genes on and off, and they don't control it.
[01:42:33.254 --> 01:42:39.298]  Because you can turn one gene on or off, but then it suddenly causes a domino effect that's different every time.
[01:42:40.039 --> 01:42:47.684]  It's like there's a roulette wheel with billions of different combinations that randomly spins once they do that.
[01:42:49.085 --> 01:42:51.807]  And it causes all sorts of mutations and problems.
[01:42:52.608 --> 01:42:55.030]  And most of the food you eat has insect genes in it.
[01:42:55.050 --> 01:42:56.831]  They found those are very easily malleable.
[01:42:58.281 --> 01:43:02.025]  I mean, they've got chimera food you're eating with 50 different plants and animals in it.
[01:43:02.065 --> 01:43:08.310]  I mean, for some reason the cockroach is their favorite because they got its code decades ago and the cockroach is everywhere.
[01:43:08.590 --> 01:43:10.412]  Most of the food you eat has cockroach genes in it.
[01:43:10.632 --> 01:43:18.699]  Before you giggle and snicker and get in the corner in a catatonic state and say Bebo 50 times, just go Google it and go research the scientific documents.
[01:43:19.099 --> 01:43:27.843]  I told you two years ago Google was using cameras and microphones mounted in your new computers to watch and listen to you, and now they admit the phone companies are doing it.
[01:43:28.083 --> 01:43:28.683]  I just can't.
[01:43:29.163 --> 01:43:30.124]  It's so far gone.
[01:43:30.184 --> 01:43:31.024]  It's so crazy.
[01:43:31.044 --> 01:43:33.465]  And I know you don't love your kids, man.
[01:43:33.505 --> 01:43:36.466]  You want to act cool and be a preppy yuppie or be a stylish liberal.
[01:43:36.686 --> 01:43:38.627]  You'll just keep feeding your kids all the poison.
[01:43:38.667 --> 01:43:39.467]  You won't listen to me.
[01:43:39.547 --> 01:43:39.987]  Fine.
[01:43:40.027 --> 01:43:40.668]  Just don't listen.
[01:43:40.748 --> 01:43:41.008]  Okay?
[01:43:41.528 --> 01:43:45.151]  I mean, this elite is so out of control, they're probably going to destroy the planet soon anyways.
[01:43:45.612 --> 01:43:47.533]  So, just say la vie, and you know.
[01:43:47.853 --> 01:43:48.854]  I'm just trying my best.
[01:43:48.974 --> 01:43:50.556]  I said I'd get into the history of the global elite.
[01:43:50.916 --> 01:43:51.296]  It's simple.
[01:43:51.336 --> 01:43:56.320]  They figured out fractional reserve banking, how to come in and loan out ten times the money they actually have.
[01:43:56.581 --> 01:43:57.761]  They bought up the whole planet.
[01:43:58.082 --> 01:44:01.645]  Any country that doesn't let them take control is called a terrorist and bombed and obliterated.
[01:44:02.125 --> 01:44:09.211]  They got into the position where they don't even need us anymore with robotics and mechanized factories, and the elite are openly saying they want to cull our numbers.
[01:44:09.671 --> 01:44:18.693]  With these new technologies, they do have massive live extension systems, but they said the earth will become even more populated if they give this to the general public, so they're suppressing you having general access to it.
[01:44:18.733 --> 01:44:21.954]  All right, I've got to send a kid to show weekdays.
[01:44:21.974 --> 01:44:22.954]  Everybody knows about that.
[01:44:23.154 --> 01:44:25.815]  And I'll be back here next Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:44:26.435 --> 01:44:28.276]  Central Time, 5 to 7 Eastern.
[01:44:28.976 --> 01:44:30.756]  And I just love you all that do care.
[01:44:30.896 --> 01:44:33.377]  I talk sternly to people, because I'm trying to wake you up.
[01:44:33.617 --> 01:44:34.537]  Good job to the crew.
[01:44:34.997 --> 01:44:37.798]  God bless you all, and go and tell a bro you'll never stop me.
[01:44:41.872 --> 01:44:42.792]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[01:44:42.852 --> 01:44:49.973]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[01:44:50.233 --> 01:44:53.114]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.
[01:44:53.314 --> 01:44:58.995]  If you have a business product or message that could benefit from this broadcast locally, call the station you're listening to.
[01:44:59.215 --> 01:45:01.715]  For national exposure, call 877-996-4327.
[01:45:03.676 --> 01:45:08.116]  Become a part of the Genesis team by calling your local station or call the national line at 877-996-4327.
[01:45:12.998 --> 01:45:15.479]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:17.840]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[01:45:18.561 --> 01:45:21.722]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[01:45:22.383 --> 01:45:28.846]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[01:45:29.626 --> 01:45:31.828]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[01:45:32.208 --> 01:45:32.648]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:45:32.808 --> 01:45:34.129]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
