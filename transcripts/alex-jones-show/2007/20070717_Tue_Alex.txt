[00:00:05.643 --> 00:00:09.825]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:11.306]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.066 --> 00:00:12.966]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.627 --> 00:00:17.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.809 --> 00:00:21.891]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:33.426]  Oh, yeah.
[00:00:41.232 --> 00:00:46.234]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 17th day edition of July 2007.
[00:00:46.354 --> 00:01:05.903]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we've got a guest coming up in an hour and a half who has witnessed across the land the incredible scourge of terrorism, of real terrorism, Child Protective Services, Department of Family Services,
[00:01:06.647 --> 00:01:18.609]  Carrying out the larger eugenics plan to break up the family and institutionalize our children and to brain damage and brainwash our children all officially by design.
[00:01:18.629 --> 00:01:21.310]  And when I say that, I don't say that for effect.
[00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.051]  That's really the plan and it's being carried out.
[00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:29.912]  So that is coming up with Greg Hessen from MassOutrage.com.
[00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:34.924]  In the meantime, we're going to have open phones today.
[00:01:34.964 --> 00:01:41.148]  We'll also have open phones when he's on with us at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:44.991]  And again, I want to encourage first-time callers to call in.
[00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:50.615]  You'll go to the front of the line, and people who disagree, you will actually trump them and stay at the very front.
[00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:58.200]  And just regular callers, we always love to hear from you as well, but we want to give people who've never called in or who disagree a chance.
[00:01:59.761 --> 00:02:00.142]  In fact,
[00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:13.554]  Just a newsflash, people that disagree with anything I have to say or do, you don't have to call up and lie to get through the folks that answer the phones like you would with Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity or Glenn Beck.
[00:02:14.394 --> 00:02:16.595]  We just want to know your first name, where you're calling from.
[00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:18.316]  Alright?
[00:02:18.416 --> 00:02:22.338]  And unlike them, if you disagree, you go to the head of the line, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:29.973]  Now, what Hannity does is that if you're really stupid and the call screener thinks you're dumb and disagree, they'll put you at the head of the line.
[00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:33.559]  But if you're eloquent or intelligent or informed, it's not going to happen.
[00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:42.828]  I hate the Hannity line where people call in and make little comments and they only put the stupid stuff on there.
[00:02:43.308 --> 00:02:53.116]  Again, it's all psychological warfare, all crafted to neutralize conservatives, to pacify conservatives just long enough to get their New World Order in.
[00:02:53.456 --> 00:02:56.279]  Well, we're breaking through that paradigm here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.304]  Impeach now or face the end of constitutional democracy.
[00:03:02.344 --> 00:03:06.347]  That's from Counterpunch, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:03:07.552 --> 00:03:12.053]  And we've got our own article out today about his comments on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:12.554 --> 00:03:18.615]  Former Reagan official Bush may stage false flying events to reinstate the draft.
[00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:19.736]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:34.120]  The Pentagon gets up and hypes terror all day and on cue three weeks ago Bin Laden tapes get released and number two in Al Qaeda says they're behind the car bombings and they're going to kill us and
[00:03:35.015 --> 00:03:43.540]  Chertoff feels things in his gut, and they tell us Al-Qaeda, Al-CIA has rebuilt itself, is going to hit us, and it's the summer of terror, get ready!
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.384]  We got to go into Iran, and then meanwhile, we tend to just get desensitized to it all.
[00:03:52.605 --> 00:04:02.790]  But in the real world, not in the hype world, but in the real world, there is serious, massive, continuing, sustained,
[00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.322]  Preparation for real live martial law in this country.
[00:04:09.963 --> 00:04:16.506]  And we would be fools if we didn't discuss it because it is a very distinct possibility.
[00:04:17.286 --> 00:04:19.087]  Approaching a 50-50 chance.
[00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:24.731]  Right now it's over 20-30% chance of actually going under hot martial law.
[00:04:25.191 --> 00:04:32.795]  We're under a cold war right now as we're incrementally taught how to be slaves, conditioned, re-educated.
[00:04:34.867 --> 00:04:39.131]  And then we also have what's happening with the dollar, what's happening with the stock market.
[00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:41.613]  We're going to talk about that when we get back.
[00:04:42.293 --> 00:04:43.294]  We're going to have open phones.
[00:04:43.334 --> 00:04:46.597]  What do you see happening in the next 12 to 24 months?
[00:04:47.237 --> 00:04:48.578]  What preparations have you made?
[00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.160]  Can we avert going into martial law?
[00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:57.886]  Or will George Bush just pass the baton to Hillary Clinton to continue to carry the ball down the field against us?
[00:05:01.764 --> 00:05:06.707]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:09.268]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:05:09.328 --> 00:05:16.792]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:05:17.132 --> 00:05:20.154]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:23.896]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:33.560]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.321]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:44.664]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:05:44.924 --> 00:05:46.285]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:07.219]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:09.501]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:17.508]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.194 --> 00:06:25.257]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.657 --> 00:06:37.082]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.382 --> 00:06:40.944]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.344 --> 00:06:43.285]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.605 --> 00:06:47.387]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:06:48.047 --> 00:06:55.522]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:03.766]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:03.907 --> 00:07:09.169]  How about fluorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:14.732]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.152 --> 00:07:16.272]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.633 --> 00:07:25.517]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membrane.
[00:07:25.957 --> 00:07:27.559]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:31.963]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:36.647]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[00:07:37.028 --> 00:07:38.689]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:41.632]  Keep it natural.
[00:07:41.932 --> 00:07:45.555]  Call Calvin Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:46.015 --> 00:07:50.098]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:50.339 --> 00:07:54.582]  Try Calvin Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:59.546]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:01.207 --> 00:08:03.849]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.192]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.708 --> 00:08:34.476]  Did you notice how last week the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the indice of top 30 stocks, dropped twice, huge drops, and then each time it would surge past
[00:08:35.396 --> 00:08:39.399]  It's previous record the next day, a rally in the market.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:50.606]  Shut up, of course, in the 1980s was the Plunge Protection Team with the Federal Reserve, where they go in and buy tens of billions of dollars worth of stock.
[00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:53.728]  I mean, talk about insider trading, and it's done in select stocks.
[00:08:54.628 --> 00:09:00.332]  Now, remember, the Dow Jones Industrial 30 is just the big 30 stock, so it's a very thin slice
[00:09:01.152 --> 00:09:05.413]  Of the overall stock market and the different shares that are being traded in.
[00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:16.757]  So it also creates an illusion there that people think, oh look, the stock market is surging when it's only the winners that are kept in those top 30.
[00:09:16.837 --> 00:09:24.099]  Then you look at unemployment, that once you go off the unemployment rolls, you're counted as employed.
[00:09:25.379 --> 00:09:26.840]  And that's why we only have 5%, 6% unemployment.
[00:09:29.122 --> 00:09:36.065]  The numbers are completely and totally cooked, but industry does actually create a second set of books and does have accurate numbers.
[00:09:36.426 --> 00:09:39.027]  The federal government's saying we got about 5% inflation.
[00:09:39.047 --> 00:09:49.412]  Now the real inflation put out by several different major brokerage houses and institutions is over 13%, and that of course compounds.
[00:09:49.632 --> 00:09:53.494]  So we're talking about a lot of really serious issues here.
[00:09:53.534 --> 00:09:55.355]  I mean, I'm not an economist, but I've interviewed
[00:09:56.147 --> 00:10:06.351]  Many top economists here on the broadcast, Nobel Prize winners, local economists, successful businessmen, and I've studied it quite a bit myself, but this is not rocket science.
[00:10:08.672 --> 00:10:17.636]  And the big number is, and I was sitting around the dinner table last night and my wife was pointing out, hey, I guess she hadn't heard the show yesterday, she's like,
[00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:24.577]  Did you notice that the stock market went down twice last week and then now suddenly it's an all-time record, just a few points away from 14,000?
[00:10:24.617 --> 00:10:28.480]  And I said, yeah, and I said, what do you think's behind that?
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.063]  And she rightfully had it figured out and she said the dollar's devalued.
[00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:36.827]  And so it's going to take more dollars to buy those stocks.
[00:10:36.847 --> 00:10:43.693]  If in 2000, the euro opened at 82 cents to the dollar, and it's now 138 plus against the dollar.
[00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:53.929]  The Euro has seen a 55 plus percent increase.
[00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:58.492]  I know I talk a lot about this because the general public still isn't aware.
[00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:04.456]  I guess I feebly believe that maybe we can affect change and wake people up.
[00:11:05.744 --> 00:11:13.909]  But I was up at the KLBJ studios last Sunday doing my show, and there was a big news crew in there because they were doing stuff for Lady Bird Johnson.
[00:11:14.290 --> 00:11:18.452]  The Johnsons used to own the station just a few years ago, and they'd been at the funeral covering it.
[00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:27.518]  You know, nice folks up there, but I was having arguments and debates with them, like, well, hey, you saw the stock market, $13,000 plus last Friday it closed.
[00:11:27.598 --> 00:11:30.179]  I mean, I hear you saying the economy's in trouble.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:31.400]  What do you say to that?
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:34.262]  And like laughing very self-assuredly,
[00:11:35.143 --> 00:11:38.908]  And I said, type in International Bank of Settlements World Depression.
[00:11:39.689 --> 00:11:44.475]  He typed it in and he was reading their official reports about how we're probably going to go into a global depression.
[00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:48.180]  And I said, he said, well then, if they're evil in the world order, why are they reporting on it?
[00:11:48.801 --> 00:11:49.642]  Why are they telling us?
[00:11:49.702 --> 00:11:51.885]  And I go, well, they're posing as our saviors.
[00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.179]  They're now positioning themselves.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:12:03.407]  Historically, a few years before a major crash or major downturn, they start positioning themselves as the saviors, warning everyone.
[00:12:03.447 --> 00:12:09.131]  And it's kind of like an arsonist who is the first person who reports a fire to the police.
[00:12:09.772 --> 00:12:15.896]  And the first person they rightfully question is the first person that reported the church was on fire out in the middle of the country.
[00:12:17.978 --> 00:12:19.339]  I mean, this is how they do it.
[00:12:19.399 --> 00:12:20.360]  This is how they
[00:12:21.886 --> 00:12:23.147]  This is how they operate.
[00:12:25.028 --> 00:12:28.189]  And I don't know what else I can say or do on this subject.
[00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:46.738]  But when you've got the Federal Reserve and the International Bank of Settlements and the Bank of England and the Bundesbank and others running around saying and doing this, you have the handful of multinational companies that still have headquarters in the U.S.
[00:12:49.139 --> 00:12:50.820]  involved in a mass exodus.
[00:12:52.742 --> 00:12:56.625]  I mean, just picture people fleeing Egypt.
[00:12:57.586 --> 00:13:06.474]  Or, you know, picture Titan A.E., you know, that cartoon with everybody leaving the planet before it blows up and there's these millions of spaceships taking off.
[00:13:06.534 --> 00:13:10.117]  I mean, that's basically, economically, what it is.
[00:13:10.157 --> 00:13:16.102]  I mean, they are fleeing, not even before they've sold headquarters.
[00:13:16.142 --> 00:13:17.723]  They're just leaving them empty.
[00:13:18.143 --> 00:13:21.166]  They're just like they know that the Black Death is coming or something.
[00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:34.941]  And I'm sitting here watching this, and the general public's hearing reports about Al-Qaeda sneaking around in the bushes, and we're gonna get hit any minute, and boy, after the next attack, martial law's coming, but it's good.
[00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:39.364]  I mean, they have paid CIA front people like Tommy Franks and others.
[00:13:39.705 --> 00:13:41.766]  It comes out later, totally paid, on the payroll.
[00:13:42.687 --> 00:13:49.473]  I knew Franks was on the payroll when I saw him get on Fox News and go, I'm no longer in the government, and I'm non-partisan, but I fully support the war.
[00:13:50.662 --> 00:13:52.383]  And we need to have martial law.
[00:13:52.403 --> 00:13:53.864]  I'm real sad to say.
[00:13:54.684 --> 00:13:56.785]  And I went, oh my gosh, he's paid to say that.
[00:13:56.845 --> 00:14:04.809]  Later it came out, 500 plus grand a year to make a few appearances a month on TV and say martial law is coming.
[00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:13.033]  I mean, it's just, I can't believe they're doing it to this country, but they are.
[00:14:13.874 --> 00:14:14.234]  They are.
[00:14:15.262 --> 00:14:16.663]  And I want to keep living my life.
[00:14:16.763 --> 00:14:36.113]  I want to go to the neighborhood swimming pool, and I want to go to the park, and I want to go eat enchiladas, and you know, I want to go eat steaks, and I want to go lift weights, and I want to go on vacations and go to the beach, but all I can think about is how we're literally on the precipice.
[00:14:40.235 --> 00:14:41.716]  And you read an article like this,
[00:14:43.965 --> 00:14:48.628]  You have the dollar devalued by more than 55% against the Euro.
[00:14:50.409 --> 00:14:53.110]  About a cent more against British Sterling, the Pound.
[00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:57.873]  You want to know who runs things, folks?
[00:14:57.953 --> 00:15:01.555]  It isn't the Lira that's surging, it's the Pound.
[00:15:02.855 --> 00:15:05.137]  That's where all the powers are, right there.
[00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.820]  The Dow Jones Industrial crosses the 14,000 mark.
[00:15:13.448 --> 00:15:23.015]  It was right at it just a few points away last night and now it's gone over it today.
[00:15:24.776 --> 00:15:39.026]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average swept past 14,000 for the second time Tuesday, rising on a relatively mild inflation report and better than expected profit reports from blue chip names including Coca-Cola,
[00:15:40.217 --> 00:15:48.006]  And Merrill Lynch, the stock market's best known indicator, crossed the 14,000 in the first half of trading.
[00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:51.370]  Rupert Murdoch's going to own that name now and own that.
[00:15:52.951 --> 00:15:57.577]  The Dow Jones Industrial Index, it looks like he's going to get the Bancroft Wall Street Journal.
[00:15:59.038 --> 00:16:01.381]  Doesn't matter, they really got it a long time ago with their people.
[00:16:03.266 --> 00:16:10.112]  The stock market best known indicator crossed the 14,000 in the first half hour of trading, rising to 14,002.60.
[00:16:14.196 --> 00:16:18.079]  Having taken just 57 trading days to make the trip from 13,000.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:29.189]  And people are running around, they're driving around in their debt-owned BMWs, in their debt-owned houses, with their
[00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:34.973]  Your wife's got breast implants that aren't even paid for yet.
[00:16:36.254 --> 00:16:37.575]  Please don't send me a hundred emails.
[00:16:37.715 --> 00:16:39.537]  I'm not attacking women that have breast implants.
[00:16:39.557 --> 00:16:42.179]  My point is, not even the breast implants are paid for.
[00:16:42.839 --> 00:16:46.742]  You probably put those collagen injections and the Botox on a credit card.
[00:16:47.643 --> 00:16:54.128]  But you're feeling real good in your self-love and you're feeling like little movie stars at the local tennis court.
[00:16:55.325 --> 00:17:00.006]  And your stock made a little bit of money, so you're feeling good right now.
[00:17:00.066 --> 00:17:03.007]  Let me give you a 101 newsflash.
[00:17:05.507 --> 00:17:17.410]  With the devaluation of the dollar, the stock market is only at half of its value.
[00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:22.951]  So, for the stock market to have truly
[00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:37.116]  Doubled in value, it would be at $28,000 right now.
[00:17:39.897 --> 00:17:43.039]  And if you look at the numbers, it went up to
[00:17:46.334 --> 00:17:57.643]  What, close to 12,000 in 2000 and then it went down and then really plunged the week before 9-11 and then further after 9-11 and now it's built back its losses and gained 2,000 points on top of that.
[00:17:58.604 --> 00:18:06.771]  But if you have a dollar that's been devalued by half and so that takes twice as many dollars to buy stock
[00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:18.929]  Then, if for the stock market just to retain the current value it had in 2000, it would need to be at 24,000 right now.
[00:18:18.949 --> 00:18:30.058]  So, when you realize then that it's only at 14,000, you understand that the stock market has lost nearly half
[00:18:39.464 --> 00:18:42.206]  Of its value just in the Dow Jones Industrials.
[00:18:42.686 --> 00:18:53.271]  And if you look at all of the other stock indicators that look at the weaker baskets of stocks and the junk stocks, those things are down at toilet bowl level.
[00:18:58.314 --> 00:19:07.639]  And I could be picking up a pizza at a local pizza place to take back to the office, and a yuppie will swagger up and go, I like your show, but man, the stock market!
[00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:09.294]  And I don't even argue.
[00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.675]  I go, yeah, yeah, man, sure.
[00:19:12.436 --> 00:19:18.081]  And I kind of got roped into it Sunday and had like a three-minute argument and I did convince him by the end of it.
[00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:20.122]  I said, can you do math?
[00:19:20.723 --> 00:19:22.024]  I'm not being condescending.
[00:19:22.944 --> 00:19:30.650]  If the dollar's been devalued by 55% and the stock market's only up 2,000 points from 2,000 level,
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.461]  Then, is this a major gain?
[00:19:38.621 --> 00:19:39.682]  Or is it a major loss?
[00:19:40.462 --> 00:19:41.683]  I mean, I'm mad about it.
[00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:43.604]  The little bit of money I got has been devalued.
[00:19:44.425 --> 00:19:48.347]  And there's yuppies just dancing around like they've entered Valhalla.
[00:19:50.348 --> 00:19:52.089]  And they've got the champagne out, folks.
[00:19:52.409 --> 00:19:54.310]  There's parties going on everywhere right now.
[00:19:54.891 --> 00:19:55.611]  Oh, we're at $14,000!
[00:19:55.991 --> 00:19:58.853]  And literally, we're on the edge of martial law.
[00:20:02.404 --> 00:20:06.269]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:07.550]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:11.294]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:20:11.575 --> 00:20:14.098]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:20:14.498 --> 00:20:16.260]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.723]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:20:19.924 --> 00:20:25.527]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:20:25.567 --> 00:20:28.049]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:20:28.109 --> 00:20:29.970]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:40.155]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.

[00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:47.339]  That's 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:06.194]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[00:21:06.394 --> 00:21:10.838]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:44.460]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.

[00:21:53.965 --> 00:21:55.610]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:55.671 --> 00:21:56.714]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.187 --> 00:22:05.748]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:22:06.168 --> 00:22:09.089]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:11.970]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:17.151]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:22:17.552 --> 00:22:22.913]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:22:23.213 --> 00:22:26.174]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[00:22:26.374 --> 00:22:27.054]  We're good to go.
[00:22:49.825 --> 00:22:51.326]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[00:22:51.366 --> 00:22:52.646]  After a pedicure they look great.
[00:22:52.666 --> 00:22:54.967]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[00:22:54.987 --> 00:22:56.487]  Haven't you heard about Cal-X ointment?
[00:22:56.507 --> 00:22:58.428]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:22:58.448 --> 00:22:59.488]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:23:19.724 --> 00:23:20.787]  What's that name again?
[00:23:21.168 --> 00:23:22.331]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:23:22.752 --> 00:23:23.915]  It's Calex.
[00:23:24.336 --> 00:23:26.161]  C-A-L-E-X.
[00:23:26.522 --> 00:23:28.367]  What makes Calex Leutmann so different?
[00:23:29.136 --> 00:23:37.758]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:23:38.198 --> 00:23:43.900]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:55.423]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:23:56.082 --> 00:23:57.188]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[00:23:57.530 --> 00:23:58.193]  I'll be right back.
[00:23:58.314 --> 00:24:00.024]  I'm getting some Calyx for my heels.
[00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:28.761]  It's really just inflation.
[00:24:28.781 --> 00:24:33.503]  If a currency has been devalued by half, a hot dog that costs $2 is going to cost $3 or $4 or $5.
[00:24:33.563 --> 00:24:34.203]  A car that costs $15,000.
[00:24:34.383 --> 00:24:38.684]  A lot of you remember buying a car 10 years ago that cost $15,000?
[00:24:38.724 --> 00:24:39.065]  The same car
[00:24:56.576 --> 00:24:58.017]  Just a newer model now costs $30,000, $32,000, $35,000.
[00:24:58.858 --> 00:25:03.502]  Oh, that's not inflation?
[00:25:05.644 --> 00:25:12.871]  And the federal government brags about this, how they artificially try to keep down eggs and milk and with mass production been able to do that and butter.
[00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.053]  But even staples are going up.
[00:25:15.093 --> 00:25:19.937]  Look at fuel doubling in prices the last three years and now they're talking about it going up even higher.
[00:25:23.058 --> 00:25:28.100]  And there is some truth to it that it isn't the oil companies raking you over the coals, and they were already doing that before.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.682]  I remember hearing a John Stossel report two years ago, and he said, no, it's because of inflation.
[00:25:35.403 --> 00:25:38.224]  It's because the dollar isn't as valuable.
[00:25:38.264 --> 00:25:42.306]  I was surprised they let that out on ABC News, but he did tell the truth.
[00:25:43.806 --> 00:25:50.329]  For some reason, they're airing John Stossel on the local news station on the radio, so I was able to hear that.
[00:25:51.343 --> 00:26:02.991]  So when you hear it's 14,000 folks, let me show you, you've got a 50 plus percent drop in the dollar internationally, but the stock market's only gone up, what is 2,000 points from 12,000?
[00:26:03.071 --> 00:26:05.312]  What is that, like 15% increase?
[00:26:05.332 --> 00:26:06.613]  Off the top of my head, 14% increase?
[00:26:06.633 --> 00:26:08.314]  What does that mean?
[00:26:15.097 --> 00:26:36.487]  It means we've had a massive decrease in the value of the stock market, but if you study inflationary bubbles, generally in times past, it takes two to four years after currencies are truly inflated for it then to fully adjust in the market of the home country.
[00:26:39.398 --> 00:26:51.324]  In Germany or in Mexico, places where this has happened in the last hundred years, in Asia, it takes a few years because internally people still have confidence and they don't know.
[00:26:51.884 --> 00:26:53.865]  And so I'm kind of torn here.
[00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:54.925]  I'm like, well, I live here.
[00:26:57.246 --> 00:26:58.327]  I've got a mortgage payment.
[00:26:58.407 --> 00:26:59.327]  I live in this country.
[00:26:59.447 --> 00:27:02.689]  It may be fiat, it may be a fraud, but
[00:27:05.322 --> 00:27:07.863]  Maybe it's good people have got a rational exuberance.
[00:27:07.923 --> 00:27:10.885]  Maybe it's good they think $14,000 is exciting.
[00:27:11.725 --> 00:27:19.088]  Maybe it's good that they're just so dumbed down that they're going along with it all, because somehow that may keep things going.
[00:27:19.989 --> 00:27:27.292]  But then I come back to reality and I go, yeah, that's if we had a beneficent elite running things, but we don't.
[00:27:27.412 --> 00:27:34.095]  They openly get us as deep in debt, federally, state, local, individually, corporately,
[00:27:35.948 --> 00:27:49.016]  As they can, because they issue the fiat money and they want to have booms and busts so they can consolidate real assets, ideas, intellectual property, companies, homes, businesses, factories.
[00:27:50.197 --> 00:28:04.285]  And it's about getting societies into debt, so you've got to go on welfare, you've got to join the military, you've got to get into the new make-work programs they're setting up that aren't going to be building dams and ditches and roadstops.
[00:28:05.882 --> 00:28:09.083]  Like FDR's system did.
[00:28:09.784 --> 00:28:12.025]  That was just getting you trained to this.
[00:28:12.065 --> 00:28:20.908]  No, it's going to be National Draft, but called National Service, and compulsory volunteerism, and new jobs, as you see with the billboards.
[00:28:20.948 --> 00:28:23.549]  I mean, they've gone from 300,000 cops to a million.
[00:28:23.569 --> 00:28:25.470]  They're talking about going way over two million now.
[00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:27.311]  You're just going to have cops everywhere.
[00:28:28.211 --> 00:28:34.694]  And you're going to be a cop, a security guard, or some data analyst that watches cameras, or goes through data mining, and that's the new
[00:28:35.755 --> 00:28:36.837]  Scholarships they're giving.
[00:28:36.877 --> 00:28:39.020]  I mean right here at University of Texas or A&M.
[00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.503]  CIA publicly runs both universities.
[00:28:42.184 --> 00:28:47.931]  Now they're now shifting it over to recruiting for CIA, FBI, data mining, tracking.
[00:28:49.553 --> 00:28:51.236]  I heard some guy last year call into
[00:28:52.441 --> 00:29:06.187]  Neil Bortz, nationally, from A&M in Bragg, how he's got a full master's scholarship for data mining, and how when you rent a car, everything you're doing is already being watched and run to the federal government, and he's working on that, and he's about to graduate to go run things.
[00:29:06.207 --> 00:29:15.491]  I mean, it's all tracked, but when you order a pizza, remember in 2002 they reported, what was the headline, scofflaws get busted ordering pizzas?
[00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:21.156]  And the big three pizza chains run your driver's license and everything to a criminal database.
[00:29:21.437 --> 00:29:24.998]  They get 20% of fines and convictions when you get busted.
[00:29:25.058 --> 00:29:30.121]  Do you understand that?
[00:29:30.141 --> 00:29:35.103]  Do you understand the magnitude of that?
[00:29:40.406 --> 00:29:41.467]  It's the new economy.
[00:29:42.767 --> 00:29:44.328]  It's a predatory economy.
[00:29:45.842 --> 00:29:46.823]  It's eating your own.
[00:29:51.705 --> 00:29:52.606]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.106 --> 00:29:54.707]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:58.329]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:04.617]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[00:30:04.897 --> 00:30:06.158]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:30:06.318 --> 00:30:07.318]  It's in your body.
[00:30:07.558 --> 00:30:11.400]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:15.801]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.
[00:30:15.942 --> 00:30:23.164]  For over a decade now, natural health expert Dr. Lauren Ritter has educated people everywhere about the benefits of internal cleansing.
[00:30:23.384 --> 00:30:27.206]  Now these benefits include higher energy levels, more comfortable digestion,
[00:30:27.566 --> 00:30:30.167]  High immune support and healthier looking skin.
[00:30:30.507 --> 00:30:35.109]  Now you can try Dr. Ritter's Colon Cleansing Program from the privacy of your own home.
[00:30:35.469 --> 00:30:39.770]  It's safe and natural and it gently cleanses the entire digestive tract.
[00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:42.631]  Don't let your body be the most toxic place on earth.
[00:30:42.971 --> 00:30:45.832]  Take care of your health by cleansing your colon and body.
[00:30:45.852 --> 00:30:46.092]  Dial 1-800-890-2014.

[00:31:00.318 --> 00:31:00.839]  Call now!
[00:31:02.159 --> 00:31:05.242]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[00:32:01.414 --> 00:32:04.135]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:32:04.595 --> 00:32:06.876]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[00:32:07.176 --> 00:32:10.258]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:32:10.738 --> 00:32:12.879]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:14.440]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:18.821]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[00:32:19.162 --> 00:32:22.263]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:32:22.563 --> 00:32:23.804]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[00:32:25.024 --> 00:32:33.311]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:32:33.652 --> 00:32:36.354]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:32:36.714 --> 00:32:44.041]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[00:32:44.401 --> 00:32:50.008]  To order Live 52 and for the best source of researched herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[00:32:50.028 --> 00:32:52.231]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:24.069]  Alright, I said I'd get to your phone calls and those are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:29.354]  Robert, Omar, Don, Bob, Wade and many others that are patiently holding
[00:33:32.705 --> 00:33:39.687]  But we're being told that there are all of these terrorists that are going to kill us any minute, and that's back in the news today.
[00:33:40.567 --> 00:33:55.411]  We can clearly see it's a concerted Pentagon effort with the usual known Defense Intelligence and CIA neocon websites uploading the Al-Qaeda videos and bringing them to us, and then of course it's always re-edited old Bin Laden footage.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:12.249]  And then the CIA comes out and says, we didn't say it was a new Bin Laden tape, but that's always a minor footnote in the back of the paper three days after the fear-mongering that Al-Qaeda and Bin Laden have returned, and I hear old women at the grocery store whispering about Bin Laden's back.
[00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:20.074]  And then buffoons email us and comment on our message boards that, oh, the CIA is saying it isn't old Bin Laden.
[00:34:20.794 --> 00:34:23.896]  Yeah, in a back-of-the-paper retraction.
[00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:26.254]  That's the game.
[00:34:26.314 --> 00:34:27.475]  That's the big joke.
[00:34:29.816 --> 00:34:30.997]  That's how they operate.
[00:34:33.759 --> 00:34:35.260]  And I, for one, am just sick of it.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:37.962]  I mean, look at what these social planners have done.
[00:34:38.002 --> 00:34:39.623]  They have completely wrecked the country.
[00:34:41.064 --> 00:34:45.367]  They have, by design, overrun the nation with third-world populations to bankrupt the states.
[00:34:48.269 --> 00:34:52.152]  They are just destroying our nation.
[00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:55.832]  And now they've debased our currency.
[00:34:56.633 --> 00:35:12.365]  And they've got our young men and women dying in Iraq, telling them it's to bring democracy and happiness and freedom, when the official Pentagon plan said endless sectarian war, break it in three parts, and then export violence to the next nation to overthrow it.
[00:35:15.468 --> 00:35:19.351]  Which, by the way, was developed by the Communists, and I'm not saying the New World Order is Communist.
[00:35:19.371 --> 00:35:23.694]  I'm saying that that tactic was developed by that arm of the New World Order.
[00:35:24.694 --> 00:35:28.777]  And it's just to watch it being done, it's just, it's so wicked.
[00:35:30.698 --> 00:35:36.202]  But folks driving around with Support the Troops stickers on their cars, they're listening to Proud to be an American.
[00:35:36.242 --> 00:35:37.843]  Hey, dig that out of the computer, I want to play that.
[00:35:38.564 --> 00:35:40.625]  This is a nice song, it's a patriotic song.
[00:35:40.645 --> 00:35:43.407]  Growing up, I'd hear this song and get tears in my eyes.
[00:35:43.928 --> 00:35:53.895]  And they use a song like this constantly to mind control you, and they expropriate our sacred symbols, the flag, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the eagle,
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:57.061]  Songs like this and they use it against you.
[00:35:57.081 --> 00:36:01.082]  If you're having trouble finding it, it's in the computer.
[00:36:01.102 --> 00:36:02.762]  It's in Jack McClam's file.
[00:36:03.942 --> 00:36:04.483]  For his show.
[00:36:06.403 --> 00:36:06.803]  I don't care.
[00:36:06.823 --> 00:36:07.843]  We can play it with his intro.
[00:36:08.003 --> 00:36:08.644]  I don't care.
[00:36:09.304 --> 00:36:10.604]  I like plugging a show anyways.
[00:36:12.785 --> 00:36:14.945]  But that brings us to this point.
[00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:18.746]  This is Jeff Vaughn.
[00:36:19.186 --> 00:36:20.647]  PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:36:20.667 --> 00:36:22.087]  I hope you get this out to everybody.
[00:36:23.064 --> 00:36:30.567]  The Dig Barry Brigade is bragging that they're trying to block this and they have been successfully the last two weeks blocking every story we try to get dug up on.
[00:36:31.008 --> 00:36:32.188]  We can get 500 digs.
[00:36:32.208 --> 00:36:35.850]  100 usually gets it on the main page and then from there it can get millions of views.
[00:36:36.530 --> 00:36:37.530]  We can get 500 now.
[00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:38.751]  They just laugh and ban us.
[00:36:39.271 --> 00:36:40.272]  We're doing little tests though.
[00:36:40.292 --> 00:36:47.835]  We've been changing headlines and removing the name Prison Planet and posting it through other websites and it's been making it on there.
[00:36:49.477 --> 00:36:51.738]  Pretty shameful of those folks over there.
[00:36:51.758 --> 00:36:52.878]  Let's not let them win.
[00:36:54.379 --> 00:37:00.401]  Former Reagan official, Bush may stage false flag events to reinstate the draft.
[00:37:02.262 --> 00:37:12.225]  Would a government that has lied us into two wars and is working to lie us into an attack on Iran shrink from staging terrorist attacks in order to remove opposition to its agenda, asks Roberts.
[00:37:13.085 --> 00:37:17.567]  Now, Roberts has been on with us for, I don't know, I've been interviewing Roberts for five, six years now.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:30.290]  We've seen his evolution and he has several times on the show in the last year come out and said I'm worried about a staged attack and then we would put headlines out like that and people would say he didn't really say that.
[00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:37.716]  Well now he said it in his own editorial in his own blog for Lou Rockwell and others and now there's no debating what he said.
[00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:38.056]  Okay?
[00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:39.317]  It's clear English.
[00:37:39.617 --> 00:37:41.038]  That was a quote we just read from him.
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:43.981]  Former editor of the Wall Street Journal
[00:37:45.171 --> 00:37:47.634]  Number two, Department of Treasury, the father of Reaganomics.
[00:37:47.814 --> 00:37:52.479]  It doesn't get any more mainline, rock-ribbed Republican than that, okay?
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.346]  And he's also, of course, a historian, an audition award-winning economist.
[00:37:59.087 --> 00:38:06.575]  Roberts has been dubbed the father of Reaganomics and is also a former editor and columnist for the Wall Street Journal Businessweek and Scripps Howard News Service.
[00:38:07.210 --> 00:38:08.251]  Yeah, I've never seen such hype.
[00:38:08.271 --> 00:38:08.932]  This is past pre-9-11 hype.
[00:38:08.952 --> 00:38:10.153]  I mean, this is gut check time.
[00:38:26.744 --> 00:38:38.093]  Ask yourself, would a government that has led us into two wars, and is working to lie us into another attack on Iran, shrink from staging a terror attack in order to move opposition to its agenda, writes Roberts.
[00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:50.502]  If the Bush administration wants to continue its wars in the Middle East, and to enrich the Unitary Executive, and entrench it at home, it will have to conduct some false flag operations.
[00:38:51.050 --> 00:38:58.675]  That will both frighten and anger the American people to make them accept Bush's declaration of national emergency and the return of the draft.
[00:38:59.295 --> 00:39:06.580]  Alternatively, the administration could simply allow any real terrorist plot to proceed without hindrance, and they certainly do that.
[00:39:07.201 --> 00:39:15.466]  The problem is, is usually people that are really carried out an attack are so dumb, they can't even effectively kill one person.
[00:39:17.418 --> 00:39:18.639]  I mean, it takes guts.
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:21.662]  It takes some real will to really go out and just kill innocent people.
[00:39:22.563 --> 00:39:23.744]  There isn't a lot of it going on.
[00:39:24.966 --> 00:39:34.855]  You generally gotta be some Palestinian whose brother and mommy and daddy got killed by a Hellfire missile fired from an Apache to, you know, be willing to really do something real.
[00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:41.182]  That's what always made Americans different, historically, is Americans
[00:39:44.106 --> 00:39:50.929]  Because, I guess, of the selective process of criminals and the poor and adventurers that came here, what makes up America?
[00:39:51.609 --> 00:39:54.490]  Black folks, the strongest, came here, half died on the ships.
[00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:56.910]  Right there, selective.
[00:39:58.211 --> 00:40:01.592]  It didn't matter how you got here, you were the bold adventurers.
[00:40:02.232 --> 00:40:04.713]  And Americans, historically, have been ready to get violent.
[00:40:05.473 --> 00:40:08.374]  And it does show, too, that same attitude.
[00:40:08.534 --> 00:40:10.675]  Nuking, dropping A-bombs on Japan.
[00:40:11.582 --> 00:40:13.502]  Everything else, we're a pretty animalistic group.
[00:40:14.203 --> 00:40:16.883]  By the way, that knife cuts both ways, though, for the New World Order.
[00:40:16.903 --> 00:40:20.204]  The veneer of civilization is extremely thin.
[00:40:21.604 --> 00:40:30.406]  Continuing, and the Bush Administration wants to continue its wars in the Middle East and entrench the Unitary Executive at home will have to conduct some false flag operations.
[00:40:31.246 --> 00:40:39.288]  A series of staged or permitted attacks would be spun by the captive media as a vindication of the neoconservatives' Islamophobic policy.
[00:40:40.046 --> 00:40:44.567]  The intention of which is to destroy all Middle East governments that are non-American puppet states.
[00:40:44.987 --> 00:40:46.108]  Success would give the U.S.
[00:40:46.148 --> 00:40:52.789]  control over oil, but the main purpose is to eliminate any resistance to Israel's complete absorption of Palestine into greater Israel.
[00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:56.270]  The real target isn't the trillions in oil.
[00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:58.791]  Five trillion in Iraq, that was in 2000 numbers.
[00:40:58.811 --> 00:41:01.152]  In 2001 it would be four trillion.
[00:41:01.512 --> 00:41:04.053]  Right now it's eight trillion in 2007 numbers.
[00:41:04.693 --> 00:41:05.973]  Afghanistan's three trillion.
[00:41:07.493 --> 00:41:09.114]  Six trillion in our numbers now.
[00:41:10.419 --> 00:41:12.101]  It's not the hundreds of billions in opium.
[00:41:12.141 --> 00:41:13.322]  That's all just icing on the cake.
[00:41:13.382 --> 00:41:18.708]  It's not the hundreds of billions in no-bid weapons sales each year, or no-bid contracts.
[00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:24.274]  It's about putting troops into checkpoints, kicking down doors every day, to bring them back here and make them cops.
[00:41:24.935 --> 00:41:25.956]  It's about America.
[00:41:26.076 --> 00:41:27.418]  We're the big prize.
[00:41:27.818 --> 00:41:28.919]  We're the plum.
[00:41:30.121 --> 00:41:31.302]  Just like Palpatine.
[00:41:33.715 --> 00:41:36.759]  In a children's movie, the real target was the home world.
[00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:38.721]  The real target was the heart of the empire.
[00:41:38.981 --> 00:41:50.375]  Just like Caesar would run those foreign wars to amass the greatest military force under himself and make himself a hero so he could then later bring that army back into Rome.
[00:41:52.482 --> 00:41:54.404]  This has been done a few times before.
[00:41:54.424 --> 00:41:59.007]  That's why for anybody who studied history, I mean, we're talking white knuckles.
[00:41:59.087 --> 00:42:00.969]  People are like, race for impact!
[00:42:01.029 --> 00:42:01.589]  Get ready!
[00:42:02.010 --> 00:42:03.911]  I mean, they are moving right now.
[00:42:09.195 --> 00:42:13.859]  Think about it, Dr. Roberts says, if another 9-11 type security failure, quote,
[00:42:14.884 --> 00:42:15.765]  We're not in the works.
[00:42:15.845 --> 00:42:27.071]  Why would Homeland Security's Czar Chertoff go to the trouble of convincing the Chicago Tribune that Americans have become complacent about terror threats, and that that has a gut feeling that America will soon be hit hard?
[00:42:27.612 --> 00:42:33.595]  If you go back the last five and a half years, this is what I've said hundreds of times, and I'm going to say it again to you right now.
[00:42:33.615 --> 00:42:35.637]  I'm going to tell you right now.
[00:42:36.617 --> 00:42:39.859]  And I would ask listeners to go find these, because I don't have the staff to do it.
[00:42:40.179 --> 00:42:41.140]  I've said it hundreds of times.
[00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:47.209]  Put it together, put an article together, show how we predicted this.
[00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:52.731]  Show how we predicted this, because that maybe will wake people up.
[00:42:54.452 --> 00:42:59.635]  That when you see Chertoff and when you see Ridge, when you see these people, start saying
[00:43:00.774 --> 00:43:04.095]  There's going to be a terror attack because it's your fault, Americans.
[00:43:04.476 --> 00:43:06.016]  You didn't give up all your rights.
[00:43:06.556 --> 00:43:09.798]  You didn't let us get rid of Posse Comitatus to let the troops keep you safe.
[00:43:10.278 --> 00:43:12.079]  You didn't let us take all your freedoms.
[00:43:12.439 --> 00:43:14.900]  It's your fault the terrorists are going to attack you now.
[00:43:15.700 --> 00:43:18.261]  That is a major red flag.
[00:43:18.562 --> 00:43:21.203]  I mean, that is bells and whistles and sirens going off.
[00:43:23.542 --> 00:43:26.164]  If I had air raid sirens right now, I'd be playing them in the background.
[00:43:26.504 --> 00:43:46.717]  That's a rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
[00:43:50.723 --> 00:43:56.605]  Because, see, they've been having their psychologists and sociologists and anthropologists have been juggling this.
[00:43:57.705 --> 00:44:00.246]  Well, okay, big spectacular Hollywood event, 9-11.
[00:44:01.027 --> 00:44:06.729]  And then you have anthrax to kind of keep it going to get your legislation through, but still that doesn't work.
[00:44:07.949 --> 00:44:10.750]  And then you get your wars going and then people start waking up to you.
[00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:16.454]  Oh, they're awake to our terror paradigm, but now our agenda is in such trouble, we've got to go ahead and carry it out.
[00:44:16.894 --> 00:44:17.995]  Well, how are we going to sell it?
[00:44:18.415 --> 00:44:23.359]  Well, they're going to sell it like you guys didn't give up your rights and you didn't let us keep you safe.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:33.467]  And I've already said that many times, but I started hearing Savage three, four years ago go, let me tell you how this is going to happen.
[00:44:34.488 --> 00:44:37.050]  The big beatnik leader of the sixties, Michael Weiner.
[00:44:38.291 --> 00:44:40.692]  My gosh, folks, if you read his early books, it's sick.
[00:44:40.853 --> 00:44:41.833]  But, side issue.
[00:44:41.853 --> 00:44:50.038]  He gets up there, poses as a rabid conservative, says a lot of things that are true, mixes poison in with it, and I've heard him with pleasure.
[00:44:50.298 --> 00:44:51.558]  Let me tell you what's going to happen.
[00:44:51.919 --> 00:44:55.241]  There's going to be another attack, because you kept Bush from keeping us safe.
[00:44:55.641 --> 00:44:58.983]  And then all of you that were against the war are going to go into camps.
[00:44:59.383 --> 00:45:01.644]  And we're not going to pay for you, pay for your food.
[00:45:01.664 --> 00:45:03.125]  You're going to have to at least be forced labor.
[00:45:03.993 --> 00:45:05.634]  Well, they had already built those folks, see?
[00:45:06.475 --> 00:45:09.196]  And conservatives are hearing that, getting conditioned to accept it.
[00:45:09.797 --> 00:45:12.979]  So when the attack happens, they're going to run out on the streets feeling self-righteous.
[00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:15.861]  See, we told you, you see what happened.
[00:45:16.461 --> 00:45:19.203]  But I'm here to tell the New World Order, and they already know this, it isn't going to work.
[00:45:19.913 --> 00:45:21.394]  You don't even have them anymore.
[00:45:21.714 --> 00:45:23.155]  They saw what you did with Amnesty.
[00:45:23.195 --> 00:45:24.895]  They saw what you did with North American Union.
[00:45:25.215 --> 00:45:27.096]  They found out what you did on 100 Issues.
[00:45:27.457 --> 00:45:30.938]  They've read the Jerusalem Post where the Israelis admit they've staged terror attacks.
[00:45:31.258 --> 00:45:32.319]  They've read the AP.
[00:45:32.579 --> 00:45:33.699]  They've read Northwoods.
[00:45:33.919 --> 00:45:35.000]  They've read Dr. Roberts.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:36.020]  They've seen my films.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:37.041]  They've seen other films.
[00:45:37.521 --> 00:45:48.649]  They know the truth, and I'm telling you folks, you've got to get Terror Storm online, and Google Video, and email it out to everybody again and again and again, and tell those that get it to email it out to everybody in a chain reaction.
[00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.971]  You've got to email out Loose Chain 2nd Edition.
[00:45:51.231 --> 00:45:53.393]  You've got to email out American Freedom from Fascism.
[00:45:53.593 --> 00:45:58.157]  You've got to get the DVDs at Infowars.com, and you've got to aggressively get them out.
[00:45:58.517 --> 00:45:59.738]  Aggressively now!
[00:46:01.139 --> 00:46:04.081]  Because I'm telling you, these control freaks never stop.
[00:46:04.101 --> 00:46:06.583]  Just like Hitler, just like they always do.
[00:46:08.619 --> 00:46:15.724]  Right when they start getting their hind ends kicked, they just get more aggressive and they go ahead and just push it right over the edge.
[00:46:18.166 --> 00:46:19.947]  It's just like when a bully keeps on a coming.
[00:46:21.108 --> 00:46:25.831]  At first, you know, when you start laying into them, they're still aggressive and they're still fighting.
[00:46:26.611 --> 00:46:31.435]  But if you just ignore whatever they're doing to you and you just keep pounding, pretty soon you're going to hear that whimper.
[00:46:32.095 --> 00:46:33.216]  I've already heard that whimper.
[00:46:34.352 --> 00:46:56.907]  You know, when some big guy comes down on you, anybody that's been in enough brawls knows this, and they start the fight, and they start hurting you, and you start hurting them right back, and they're acting real tough, and they're busy trying to intimidate you, and putting on a show for themselves, and then right when you start hurting them, you hear that whimper, and you know you got them, and boy, once you get that big guy down on the ground, you just take those boots right to them.
[00:46:59.288 --> 00:47:01.890]  The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:06.360]  And we're going to put the boots to the New World Order.
[00:47:09.623 --> 00:47:10.223]  And they know it.
[00:47:12.085 --> 00:47:13.606]  You're going to fall just like Hitler.
[00:47:15.668 --> 00:47:17.170]  Now their plan is to blame the U.S.
[00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:28.720]  as an escape valve if this putsch fails and then claim that it all happened here and have some big internationalization of it and bring in some leftist regime that keeps the police state they installed but kind of cuts back on the rhetoric.
[00:47:29.571 --> 00:47:30.732]  It's all being done scientifically.
[00:47:31.032 --> 00:47:32.193]  No, we're not going to stop there.
[00:47:32.233 --> 00:47:38.497]  We know it all comes out of Europe, and it all comes out of the New World Order, and you are going to fail New World Order.
[00:47:38.778 --> 00:47:40.779]  And we have to believe that and know that historically.
[00:47:41.439 --> 00:47:42.400]  We don't have a choice.
[00:47:46.703 --> 00:47:59.032]  Now, you can truly stand up for the Republic in its darkest hour, or you can just buy into the New World Order police state wrapped in the American flag and its theme song,
[00:47:59.941 --> 00:48:02.964]  This is, I guess, for, well, there's a duality to this.
[00:48:03.244 --> 00:48:11.391]  This song is for all the yuppies that want to believe the fraud, and who are going to have to go through a lot of pain to realize they were wrong, just like the Nazis.
[00:48:13.212 --> 00:48:16.295]  But it dually is for all of us that truly do love America.
[00:48:16.335 --> 00:48:19.718]  You know, this song, and love of this country, it's not a bad thing.
[00:48:20.663 --> 00:48:26.165]  A lot of people worldwide see the love of the New World Order, and they think that's what America really is, and so they hate this country.
[00:48:26.465 --> 00:48:27.906]  And that's all part of the New World Order plan.
[00:48:27.926 --> 00:48:30.286]  We shouldn't let them destroy the name of this country.
[00:48:31.187 --> 00:48:32.487]  So we'll take this out to break.
[00:48:32.527 --> 00:48:33.808]  Come back and start taking your calls.
[00:48:34.068 --> 00:48:34.488]  Stay with us.
[00:48:48.139 --> 00:49:14.804]  If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd work for all my life And I had to start again With just my children and my wife I thank my lucky stars To be living here today Cause the flag still stands for freedom And they can't take that away
[00:49:19.619 --> 00:49:25.146]  I'm glad to be an American where at least I know I'm free.
[00:49:25.446 --> 00:49:31.534]  And I won't forget the men who died who gave that right to me.
[00:49:31.554 --> 00:49:38.363]  And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her still today.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:50:05.806]  But I love this land God bless the USA From the lakes of Minnesota To the hills of Tennessee Across the plains of Texas From the sea to shining sea From Detroit down to Houston
[00:50:06.582 --> 00:50:09.444]  And New York to L.A.
[00:50:09.925 --> 00:50:22.796]  Well, there's pride in every American heart, and it's time we stand and say... That I'm proud to be an American!
[00:50:28.057 --> 00:50:32.699]  Don't forget the man who died who gave that right to me.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:39.843]  And I gladly stand up next to you and defend her till her day.
[00:50:40.423 --> 00:50:45.306]  Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land.
[00:50:45.406 --> 00:50:47.387]  God bless the USA!
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:51:05.203]  It's here.
[00:51:05.383 --> 00:51:10.165]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.525 --> 00:51:18.148]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:25.925]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.325 --> 00:51:29.247]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.
[00:51:29.627 --> 00:51:31.969]  A White House program to disseminate fake news.
[00:51:32.389 --> 00:51:33.270]  NSA spying.
[00:51:33.692 --> 00:51:37.733]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.033 --> 00:51:41.533]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.014 --> 00:51:43.974]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.274 --> 00:51:48.215]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.306 --> 00:52:04.327]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.627 --> 00:52:09.549]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.809 --> 00:52:14.170]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.451 --> 00:52:23.374]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.574 --> 00:52:27.195]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.495 --> 00:52:32.521]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.822 --> 00:52:39.530]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:40.681]  What about you?
[00:52:41.321 --> 00:52:46.686]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.233]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:53:04.853 --> 00:53:13.784]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:53:14.244 --> 00:53:21.453]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:53:22.145 --> 00:53:27.650]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:38.979]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.742]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:53:42.282 --> 00:53:45.063]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:53:45.103 --> 00:53:45.443]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:54:14.294 --> 00:54:38.634]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole
[00:54:40.934 --> 00:54:59.807]  The old familiar sting Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[00:55:03.029 --> 00:55:05.030]  My sweetest friend
[00:55:07.846 --> 00:55:19.130]  You know, I'm really blessed, and a lot of us are.
[00:55:19.150 --> 00:55:24.192]  To be aware of the New World Order.
[00:55:24.672 --> 00:55:26.053]  To really know the score.
[00:55:27.393 --> 00:55:33.856]  And to be able to really set our course, and consciously at least have a hand in our own destiny.
[00:55:35.467 --> 00:55:36.927]  To stand up against corruption.
[00:55:38.147 --> 00:55:40.648]  Well, we're in stormy waters, but at least we've set our course.
[00:55:40.708 --> 00:55:43.488]  We've made that decision to do the right thing.
[00:55:44.869 --> 00:55:45.769]  To not be fools.
[00:55:47.849 --> 00:55:50.810]  Robert in Texas and Omar, Don, Bob, Wade, and others.
[00:55:51.290 --> 00:55:52.070]  Robert, you're on the air.
[00:55:52.090 --> 00:55:52.650]  Thanks for holding.
[00:55:54.810 --> 00:55:55.370]  How's it going?
[00:55:56.591 --> 00:55:57.171]  We're on the air, sir.
[00:55:57.211 --> 00:55:57.531]  Go ahead.
[00:55:57.571 --> 00:55:57.871]  Welcome.
[00:55:58.971 --> 00:56:01.771]  Yeah, I wanted to talk about Cyclone Ghanu.
[00:56:02.432 --> 00:56:04.692]  It formed right below Iran.
[00:56:05.228 --> 00:56:08.832]  Curved around the tip of Oman and slammed into the side of Iran.
[00:56:09.472 --> 00:56:12.596]  It's a highly rare storm.
[00:56:12.936 --> 00:56:15.859]  They said they haven't had anything like it for the past 60 years.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:21.425]  And even 60 years ago, it wasn't comparable to the storm they had.
[00:56:22.186 --> 00:56:23.207]  That's right.
[00:56:23.227 --> 00:56:25.369]  They had a really weird storm a few months ago.
[00:56:26.423 --> 00:56:43.770]  But again, China admits they have total weather control and our government by 1968, the Stanford Research Institute with the Naval War Laboratory had confirmed that we could create and destroy hurricanes and typhoons, but now in 2007 they say none of it exists and we can just trust the government.
[00:56:44.811 --> 00:56:53.054]  Well, there is actually an article, I'm sure you've seen it on BBC.com, if you look it up, where they're talking about what they did in Malaysia
[00:56:53.615 --> 00:56:56.217]  Where they created the cyclone to get rid of the pollution?
[00:56:56.998 --> 00:57:01.642]  Yeah, there's also, the headline was out yesterday, speaking of the devil, BBC, I believe.
[00:57:01.662 --> 00:57:04.404]  I didn't even cover it because it's so passe now.
[00:57:04.824 --> 00:57:07.627]  China controls weather, and they just outright control it, yeah.
[00:57:08.601 --> 00:57:14.943]  Well, I do know that we did have, as far as China goes, didn't we have those strike fleets right in those waters?
[00:57:15.483 --> 00:57:15.684]  Yes.
[00:57:15.704 --> 00:57:18.545]  I mean, what if they hit our ships with that?
[00:57:18.585 --> 00:57:19.465]  No, it's all a big joke.
[00:57:19.505 --> 00:57:24.987]  I mean, right when they want to mess with the Iranians, they send in huge storms on them, never before seen.
[00:57:25.687 --> 00:57:29.670]  I mean, like a typhoon in the Gulf, which they've never had in recorded modern history.
[00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:40.659]  I mean, they went back and... Weathermen went back and looked at text from thousands of years ago, and big storms like that are unknown with the... And now they've got all these bizarre... But listen, everything's fine.
[00:57:40.679 --> 00:57:41.479]  There's no such thing.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:42.660]  The government loves you.
[00:57:43.561 --> 00:57:54.329]  Well, what I wanted to say, and I think the scariest thing is, all these global warming... If you type in, storms and global warming, you will get literally, you know, 50...
[00:57:55.763 --> 00:58:03.250]  I agree with where you're going.
[00:58:03.350 --> 00:58:03.710]  I agree.
[00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:06.533]  In fact, I almost put it in endgame, but I just don't have time to put it in.
[00:58:07.373 --> 00:58:18.163]  That normal weather changes are not a problem, but that the way they're hyping these deadly things, they can easily use weather weapons and scare people into accepting a world tax.
[00:58:19.164 --> 00:58:20.265]  It makes perfect sense.
[00:58:22.046 --> 00:58:22.567]  Anything else?
[00:58:23.584 --> 00:58:28.528]  They could have storms forming in the Mediterranean where they've never even had them before.
[00:58:28.868 --> 00:58:33.532]  So that looks like, to me, they're trying to attack the southern coast of Europe.
[00:58:33.652 --> 00:58:35.134]  You know, France and all those guys.
[00:58:35.154 --> 00:58:36.375]  I know, it's insane.
[00:58:37.135 --> 00:58:37.996]  It's out of control.
[00:58:38.316 --> 00:58:39.397]  We're living in the future.
[00:58:41.279 --> 00:58:46.163]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.953 --> 00:58:58.593]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.253 --> 00:59:00.314]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.034 --> 00:59:02.175]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.795 --> 00:59:03.636]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.356 --> 00:59:05.256]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.937 --> 00:59:09.559]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.119 --> 00:59:14.261]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.345 --> 00:59:23.806]  Now into the second hour.
[00:59:25.559 --> 00:59:38.952]  I hope that the frequency of our discussion of this doesn't dent your resolve and your frostiness and your alertness because we're on the razor's edge.
[00:59:39.653 --> 00:59:44.717]  Former Reagan official, Bush may stage false flag events to reinstate the draft.
[00:59:44.737 --> 00:59:45.678]  We'll get more into that.
[00:59:46.279 --> 00:59:49.422]  Impeachment now or face the end of the republic.
[00:59:52.658 --> 01:00:01.205]  Also, Brown, the new Prime Minister in England, backs a European treaty without referendum, bringing England under full EU control without the people being able to vote on it.
[01:00:01.446 --> 01:00:02.987]  Now over 90% are against it.
[01:00:03.347 --> 01:00:10.073]  The criminal, Gordon Brown, who openly calls for one world government, doesn't care, and is setting up a police state in case they resist.
[01:00:12.148 --> 01:00:15.191]  Also, Watchdog Group warns over number snooping.
[01:00:15.231 --> 01:00:19.015]  They have these scanning cameras all over the West scanning our systems.
[01:00:19.635 --> 01:00:22.878]  Hillary Clinton shuns Fox debates.
[01:00:22.938 --> 01:00:25.040]  That's for political consumption.
[01:00:26.282 --> 01:00:27.903]  But pockets Murdoch money.
[01:00:29.925 --> 01:00:30.926]  And here's the AP.
[01:00:31.026 --> 01:00:32.628]  Terror threat against U.S.
[01:00:32.668 --> 01:00:33.368]  said serious.
[01:00:33.869 --> 01:00:34.990]  New fair mongering there.
[01:00:36.323 --> 01:00:39.365]  We'll get into all of it coming up later in the shower.
[01:00:39.405 --> 01:00:40.445]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[01:00:40.865 --> 01:00:42.306]  Omar in Michigan, you're on the air.
[01:00:42.326 --> 01:00:42.927]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:43.847 --> 01:00:47.909]  Death to the New World Order and all its bootlickers, minions and serfs.
[01:00:48.409 --> 01:00:49.230]  Absolutely.
[01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:54.753]  I think if we was living like Daniel Boone, at least we'd be free.
[01:00:55.713 --> 01:00:57.734]  If you've got to go to that, then so be it.
[01:00:58.815 --> 01:01:00.856]  So, don't ever keep your head up.
[01:01:01.816 --> 01:01:02.857]  You're doing good, Alex.
[01:01:03.726 --> 01:01:08.367]  Have you heard anything about this Chinese secret society that challenges the Illuminati?
[01:01:09.927 --> 01:01:14.728]  Yeah, I'm gonna get that guy on, but frankly, I don't really buy into it.
[01:01:15.308 --> 01:01:15.708]  Okay.
[01:01:16.448 --> 01:01:17.509]  I mean, let me explain why.
[01:01:19.329 --> 01:01:20.689]  Human beings act the same.
[01:01:20.729 --> 01:01:22.249]  They behave the same throughout history.
[01:01:23.730 --> 01:01:30.491]  And if you've got these Asian triad gangs out of Japan and China,
[01:01:32.316 --> 01:01:34.937]  I happen to know those two groups hate each other vehemently.
[01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:45.299]  I happen to have actually studied those groups, and so out of the gates we hear that really there's an Asian order teamed up together, and that's Japan and China.
[01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:51.700]  Now, does the Mafia and the Lee family really run China and always run it for the last couple hundred years?
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.100]  Yes.
[01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:57.642]  Did the Lee family make a deal with the British over 150 years ago?
[01:01:57.682 --> 01:01:57.742]  Yes.
[01:01:59.554 --> 01:02:06.657]  And see, the new reporter coming out and saying all this, he's new to all this, and then he says the mafia sat down with him and told him this.
[01:02:07.337 --> 01:02:11.819]  I don't doubt that the mafia didn't sit down with him and tell him this.
[01:02:12.639 --> 01:02:14.019]  I don't doubt that.
[01:02:14.079 --> 01:02:17.141]  And I don't doubt that there isn't rivalries in the global mafia.
[01:02:17.721 --> 01:02:21.862]  But China has adopted the one-child eugenics policy.
[01:02:23.303 --> 01:02:28.805]  China has been made the golden calf of the New World Order.
[01:02:30.954 --> 01:02:35.575]  Their elite is more in line with the top globalists than anybody else.
[01:02:36.396 --> 01:02:45.879]  There's a thousand other points I could make, but listening to an interview and reading the gentleman's information, it just doesn't add up.
[01:02:46.919 --> 01:02:48.459]  We've seen lots of this before.
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:53.481]  I told my producer to get him on a few weeks ago.
[01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:55.202]  We'll get that individual on.
[01:02:55.222 --> 01:02:57.782]  Omar, give me your take on it.
[01:02:58.623 --> 01:02:59.783]  That's what I was thinking too.
[01:03:00.592 --> 01:03:02.313]  I mean, he's the only one that's saying it.
[01:03:02.473 --> 01:03:03.354]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:03:03.714 --> 01:03:12.339]  A lot of people thinking it, but ain't nobody really coming out saying it because, you know, we know how that goes with throwing stones at the belly of the beast.
[01:03:12.679 --> 01:03:19.944]  Well, I mean, remember, there have been all these other groups that claim that, you know, there's really an emergency reorganization and Congress is our friend.
[01:03:19.964 --> 01:03:21.705]  We've been hearing that for ten years.
[01:03:22.085 --> 01:03:23.025]  Right.
[01:03:23.185 --> 01:03:25.927]  And we've been hearing, you know, with Nassara, totally made up.
[01:03:26.547 --> 01:03:28.889]  I mean, we're always hearing about pie in the sky,
[01:03:29.998 --> 01:03:31.419]  No, you have a good day, Alex.
[01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:58.463]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:58.523 --> 01:04:05.845]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:04:05.985 --> 01:04:16.627]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:04:16.807 --> 01:04:21.348]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:21.648 --> 01:04:26.612]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:04:26.852 --> 01:04:29.774]  Yeah, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:30.014 --> 01:04:39.681]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[01:04:39.881 --> 01:04:46.166]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:04:46.907 --> 01:04:48.868]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:04:53.231 --> 01:04:56.694]  It's here.
[01:04:56.914 --> 01:05:01.698]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.058 --> 01:05:09.664]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.379 --> 01:05:17.442]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.842 --> 01:05:29.247]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.567 --> 01:05:33.068]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.548 --> 01:05:35.489]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.789 --> 01:05:39.651]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:06:53.434 --> 01:06:58.497]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.857 --> 01:07:01.119]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:02.944 --> 01:07:03.424]  We're good to go.
[01:07:20.055 --> 01:07:22.998]  Last hour, we played a few minutes from that song.
[01:07:23.798 --> 01:07:26.741]  It's become the neocon theme song for killing America.
[01:07:26.761 --> 01:07:30.504]  Every time they talk about getting rid of our freedoms and setting up a police state, they play that.
[01:07:30.924 --> 01:07:33.567]  Proud to be an American, where at least I know I'm free.
[01:07:34.647 --> 01:07:37.109]  And the men who died to give that right to me.
[01:07:38.451 --> 01:07:38.771]  Free!
[01:07:38.871 --> 01:07:41.453]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, due process.
[01:07:41.994 --> 01:07:45.036]  Not thousands of new bureaucrats being created every day.
[01:07:45.456 --> 01:07:46.998]  All these new millions of laws.
[01:07:47.038 --> 01:07:48.219]  It's millions of laws.
[01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:56.316]  Face scanning and license plate reading cameras everywhere with an elite dissolving our borders and our sovereignty.
[01:07:56.716 --> 01:07:58.037]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[01:07:58.097 --> 01:07:59.498]  Don in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:07:59.518 --> 01:08:01.139]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:01.279 --> 01:08:15.550]  I'm actually calling about something that happened on the show yesterday, but as an info warrior going back to the 1970s when we, I guess the most effective tool was that book, none dare call it conspiracy.
[01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:18.372]  That's really what put all the pieces together for me.
[01:08:19.427 --> 01:08:24.811]  When I was about 16, 17 years old, I read that and that was very formative.
[01:08:24.831 --> 01:08:28.954]  Yeah, I bought many and loaned them out and I got them back.
[01:08:29.114 --> 01:08:33.657]  But your videos, it's so much easier to get somebody to read a video than to watch a video.
[01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:41.243]  But I was calling about your guest yesterday, Chuck Walters, as a subscriber to AcresUSA.
[01:08:42.552 --> 01:08:49.839]  I know that many people in the Patriot Movement, when they hear the word sustainable, a red flag comes up, and rightfully so.
[01:08:49.939 --> 01:08:57.126]  That's because the Globalists have taken that term over, but we're talking about really sustaining your farm, sustaining the value of the soil.
[01:08:57.146 --> 01:09:04.352]  Yeah, the majority of our subscribers are people who are trying to hang on to family farms and make a living.
[01:09:05.768 --> 01:09:17.591]  People who live in the cities and the suburbs can help is to join CSA, that's Community Supported Agriculture, where you actually buy in and harvest your own crops.
[01:09:17.611 --> 01:09:23.593]  You have input about what things are growing and the money stays in your local community and helps somebody stay on the farm.
[01:09:23.613 --> 01:09:34.196]  Well, people can also do that by, I don't care if it's 50 miles away, driving to farmers markets and you end up getting to buy it cheaper at a lot higher quality from the organic farmers markets.
[01:09:34.676 --> 01:09:35.116]  And folks,
[01:09:36.124 --> 01:09:39.970]  If there isn't one in your town or city, that is a business opportunity.
[01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:40.951]  You ought to go around.
[01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:42.934]  You don't even have a history in farming.
[01:09:43.535 --> 01:09:49.183]  You need to go find some parking lot in a central location, easy to get to, that you can rent for cheap.
[01:09:50.214 --> 01:09:52.135]  Yes, also Alex, there's something else that's come up.
[01:09:52.175 --> 01:09:54.396]  Another means of making living on the farm is pastured poultry.
[01:10:20.151 --> 01:10:30.498]  And if this RFID thing goes through, and we're having to do that, it's going to destroy that opportunity for farmers to make money.
[01:10:30.658 --> 01:10:32.219]  You're talking about free-range chickens?
[01:10:32.699 --> 01:10:42.206]  Well, not free-range, but the pastures and pens where you move them each day, where they get to breathe fresh air, drink clean water, eat the bugs and the grass and the weeds.
[01:10:42.226 --> 01:10:45.528]  Well, sure, that's what I'm... But, see, that's the point, is that
[01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:56.838]  All over the country organics gone from like 3 or 4 percent of the total sales and now over 20 percent and the growth curve is going to be over half within just a couple years.
[01:10:57.419 --> 01:11:16.154]  They're panicking so then last year they passed a law where the federal USDA seal it can be 75 percent non-organic they can still get the seal now but then other groups come in and self-certify and are trusted and so that makes the feds even matter and yes for those that don't know
[01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:33.277]  Big Ag wrote the Animal ID Act, and it means you gotta put a $10 tag on each $3 chicken, but then the big mega chicken farms that have millions of chickens, they just buy lot IDs and don't even have to follow it.
[01:11:33.657 --> 01:11:35.218]  It is designed and written.
[01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:41.857]  To shut down small family farms that have an average of 30 cows and less than 100 chickens.
[01:11:42.537 --> 01:11:44.179]  And that's about the average.
[01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:46.801]  And again, these families, I know them.
[01:11:47.282 --> 01:11:49.684]  And I've got family that does this as well, right here in Texas still.
[01:11:50.868 --> 01:12:03.912]  They'll have jobs in town, at the power plant, or Walmart, or at the Sheriff's Department, and then the rest of the family stays home, works the land, and works all year just to pay the property taxes.
[01:12:05.073 --> 01:12:06.953]  In most cases, it isn't even profitable.
[01:12:07.934 --> 01:12:18.637]  And they've got some old 30-year-old tractor with bailing wire, rigged up, still working, hanging on by their fingernails in an old ranch house falling apart.
[01:12:19.264 --> 01:12:25.187]  And folks, that's what agriculture is like in this country, and the big ag farms are right next door begging you to sell.
[01:12:25.567 --> 01:12:28.689]  Is that not a pretty accurate description of what you're witnessing in your area, Don?
[01:12:29.069 --> 01:12:33.251]  That's exactly it, and Alex, it encourages me to know that you've got the picture.
[01:12:33.311 --> 01:12:35.192]  You're reading it crystal clear.
[01:12:35.592 --> 01:12:36.813]  Thanks for your videos.
[01:12:36.833 --> 01:12:39.594]  They help me be more effective out here in my community.
[01:12:39.754 --> 01:12:40.314]  God bless you.
[01:12:40.354 --> 01:12:41.495]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[01:12:43.895 --> 01:12:48.519]  New hordes of bureaucrats that we pay taxes for to go around and harass everybody.
[01:12:48.859 --> 01:12:52.742]  Meanwhile, less regulations on the foreign goods pouring in.
[01:12:52.822 --> 01:12:58.686]  The foreign chicken, the foreign poultry of all different types, the foreign beef, the foreign pork.
[01:13:00.367 --> 01:13:01.568]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:13:01.888 --> 01:13:03.209]  It's a monopoly game.
[01:13:03.249 --> 01:13:04.370]  It's not free market.
[01:13:05.031 --> 01:13:06.792]  We always hear about how it's capitalism.
[01:13:07.272 --> 01:13:09.134]  This is the opposite of capitalism.
[01:13:10.074 --> 01:13:11.996]  It's like Carol Quigley, Bill Clinton's mentor,
[01:13:12.705 --> 01:13:19.670]  The head of the Political Science Department at Georgetown said, he said, we run both parties, we are not capitalists, we are monopoly men.
[01:13:20.611 --> 01:13:26.956]  We work with communists, we work with fascists, we work with kingmakers, we work with centralized roundtables.
[01:13:29.397 --> 01:13:34.081]  The globalists, Rockefeller and the rest of them, hate the fact that you're living in million dollar houses.
[01:13:34.787 --> 01:13:36.809]  Or $300,000 houses, depending on where you live.
[01:13:36.989 --> 01:13:38.370]  You know, big houses with swimming pools.
[01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:40.652]  They hate the fact you've got two car garages.
[01:13:40.972 --> 01:13:42.633]  They hate the fact you go on vacations.
[01:13:43.074 --> 01:13:43.894]  They hate you!
[01:13:44.655 --> 01:13:47.237]  You understand everything they do is about taking that away!
[01:13:49.118 --> 01:14:01.108]  And all the FBI and the military and the police have to do is at least check out what we're saying, find out it's true, and then just send signals you're not going along with this, and they won't be able to do it.
[01:14:03.524 --> 01:14:08.748]  I mean, you may like your spiffy black Nazi uniforms, okay, but it's 1939 Germany.
[01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:11.029]  And you saw what happened to Germany.
[01:14:11.069 --> 01:14:25.159]  You've got a chance to stop Hitler from going wild, and you can still wear your black uniforms and still look good for the girls, but the point here is you don't have to really experience what people in black uniforms end up having to experience.
[01:14:25.882 --> 01:14:40.593]  By the way, almost every case in history, well not almost every case, every case, when you start wearing black uniforms and surveillance starts going up and spying starts, within just five to ten years, the worst place to be is in the enforcer's shoes.
[01:14:41.434 --> 01:14:45.117]  I hope you've done a little history book reading.
[01:14:45.957 --> 01:14:46.578]  Crack a book.
[01:14:46.998 --> 01:14:47.959]  Do you some learning.
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:50.801]  Because you need to know what you're getting into.
[01:14:52.666 --> 01:14:56.707]  I know you've got your role model and your cheerleader Jack Bauer, but you know that isn't reality.
[01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.388]  Let me just give you a news flash.
[01:15:03.068 --> 01:15:05.749]  You're going to have the roughest time in all of this.
[01:15:07.309 --> 01:15:10.890]  And I just want you to have good lives.
[01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:12.330]  I want your children to grow up good.
[01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:13.351]  I want you to be happy.
[01:15:14.391 --> 01:15:19.192]  I want you to have a good life, and I want you to turn away from the evil before it's too late.
[01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:21.437]  And that goes for everybody.
[01:15:21.477 --> 01:15:23.999]  This country's in trouble because we've all become evil.
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:28.161]  I mean, I don't know how any of us make it.
[01:15:28.422 --> 01:15:31.163]  I mean, the way I grew up in Dallas, there's evil that was going on around me.
[01:15:31.183 --> 01:15:42.631]  With the sex and the drugs and the violence and the fighting and the drag racing and the... It was just crazy.
[01:15:43.592 --> 01:15:45.033]  Thank God I never got into drugs.
[01:15:47.682 --> 01:15:51.383]  But I saw a lot of my friends from good families destroyed by it.
[01:15:53.763 --> 01:15:56.624]  And I mean, our society is just completely fried.
[01:15:57.864 --> 01:16:03.205]  We have to be, and we have to start taking that serious and realizing just how much trouble we're all in.
[01:16:05.826 --> 01:16:08.646]  You know, I don't want violence, and I do want law and order.
[01:16:08.726 --> 01:16:11.387]  But when you've got a criminal government, you don't have law and order.
[01:16:11.407 --> 01:16:12.327]  Let's take another call.
[01:16:12.427 --> 01:16:16.228]  Bob in Pittsburgh, then Wade, Tom, Joe, and others.
[01:16:16.248 --> 01:16:16.768]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:16:17.284 --> 01:16:17.945]  Hello, Alex.
[01:16:18.265 --> 01:16:18.505]  Hi.
[01:16:19.066 --> 01:16:24.910]  Yeah, it's great to be on a show where you don't get screened ahead of time to be, you know, in compliance with what the host wants.
[01:16:25.851 --> 01:16:35.960]  Um, but what I, um, I hear you talk about going to the sound of the guns, and what I did is I got a sign, I made up a sign, and I'm standing out in rush hour traffic.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:44.647]  It says Google, Terror Storm, Loose Change, and I don't know what else to do, but, you know, I think if I can just get the word out and
[01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:53.514]  Maybe we can become like squeegee men with a bunch of people out there and rush our traffic with some signs or something because they're... I think that's very effective.
[01:16:53.554 --> 01:16:54.435]  Also big.
[01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:56.316]  You can have like a...
[01:16:58.294 --> 01:17:05.236]  You know, one by two sign for your back window made that's on a big magnet that costs you maybe fifty bucks.
[01:17:05.796 --> 01:17:07.277]  I don't know how much they cost, I'm just guessing.
[01:17:07.597 --> 01:17:18.220]  You know, that says Google 9-11 is an inside job or Google Terror Storm or PrisonPlanet.com, learn the truth, forbidden news, shocking info.
[01:17:19.221 --> 01:17:20.381]  That has an effect.
[01:17:21.361 --> 01:17:26.583]  But I mean, just for you personally, the exercise, because we've basically atrophied
[01:17:27.282 --> 01:17:48.300]  As a society, I mean people 100 years ago, even 60 years ago, for entertainment in little towns and big cities, you'd go get yourself a bottle of brew and a beer or a cup of coffee, whatever, and walk down the street to the little local park at Speaker's Corner, and everybody would be up there griping about the sheriff, and you'd hear them out.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.901]  A lot of it was bull, some of it was true.
[01:17:50.342 --> 01:17:52.664]  The sheriff might even be there speaking out against
[01:17:53.303 --> 01:18:06.710]  You know, Leroy Johnson, who's been doing this, and you've got to help him keep track of him, and he's so drunk, you know, he's going to die of liquor poisoning and we don't do something.
[01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:10.732]  I mean, that was the television set, and we were a free society.
[01:18:11.093 --> 01:18:15.655]  We're not going to be a free society shucking our thumbs watching CNN and Fox News.
[01:18:16.516 --> 01:18:17.096]  Absolutely.
[01:18:17.676 --> 01:18:20.858]  So just getting out there, just doing that,
[01:18:22.330 --> 01:18:23.771]  That is a major move.
[01:18:23.791 --> 01:18:28.454]  I mean, I'm seeing Ron Paul signs all over Austin, 9-11 inside jobs, stencils signed everywhere.
[01:18:28.894 --> 01:18:29.875]  People are getting aggressive.
[01:18:29.915 --> 01:18:31.036]  Anything else you want to add, my friend?
[01:18:31.456 --> 01:18:43.724]  Yeah, I just want to say, like, when they keep talking about these Osama Bin Laden videos, it just reminds me of some cheap Sylvester Stallone movie that they keep rehashing again and again every time they need a bump.
[01:18:45.045 --> 01:18:45.645]  I agree with you.
[01:18:45.705 --> 01:18:46.086]  Good point.
[01:18:46.146 --> 01:18:46.606]  Anything else?
[01:18:46.626 --> 01:18:47.687]  No, that's it.
[01:18:47.727 --> 01:18:48.227]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:18:48.267 --> 01:18:49.548]  Hey, I appreciate you, Bob.
[01:18:49.568 --> 01:18:50.208]  You keep it up.
[01:18:50.288 --> 01:18:50.849]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.539 --> 01:18:56.562]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:56.882 --> 01:19:01.806]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:02.067 --> 01:19:06.410]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.711 --> 01:19:15.619]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.839 --> 01:19:19.442]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.742 --> 01:19:24.765]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:25.045 --> 01:19:31.749]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.276 --> 01:19:32.917]  What about you?
[01:19:33.577 --> 01:19:38.922]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:19:53.739 --> 01:19:57.461]  Ted Anderson for Midas July 17, 2007 Gold 660, 380 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $685.24, $338.10 for half, $169.05 for quarter.
[01:19:57.481 --> 01:19:57.802]  That's $685.24, $338.10, and $169.05.
[01:19:57.862 --> 01:20:01.484]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in Euro.
[01:20:01.504 --> 01:20:03.145]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[01:20:03.165 --> 01:20:03.525]  Bad news for U.S.
[01:20:03.545 --> 01:20:03.825]  currency.
[01:20:19.855 --> 01:20:22.016]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:20:22.176 --> 01:20:23.617]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[01:20:23.877 --> 01:20:25.958]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro.
[01:20:26.099 --> 01:20:27.159]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:27.359 --> 01:20:29.881]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[01:20:30.061 --> 01:20:31.962]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[01:20:32.162 --> 01:20:34.663]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:35.804]  Why attack Iran?
[01:20:35.924 --> 01:20:38.946]  Jerome O'Coursey's Iran leads attack against the U.S.
[01:20:38.986 --> 01:20:40.427]  dollar document spells it out.
[01:20:40.547 --> 01:20:42.588]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:43.068 --> 01:20:46.490]  The value of your hard-earned money is being destroyed in a global game of chess.
[01:20:46.690 --> 01:20:50.153]  Call 800-686-2237 for Corsi's report today.
[01:20:50.273 --> 01:20:52.775]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.636 --> 01:20:56.078]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.119 --> 01:21:04.505]  Did you know that one goal of international communism was to get our young people's mind off religion by getting along to sex?
[01:21:04.665 --> 01:21:14.393]  By destroying the morals of the younger generation, America would eventually become ripe for revolution without understanding why communism wanted to make young people soft and easily controlled.
[01:21:15.527 --> 01:21:20.612]  Have we witnessed this transformation of our young people away from God and the Bible to immorality?
[01:21:21.292 --> 01:21:29.199]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:51.092 --> 01:21:58.574]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry and I'm a plastic surgeon and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[01:21:58.734 --> 01:22:01.254]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[01:22:01.294 --> 01:22:06.476]  It's called Night Skin and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and

[01:23:03.667 --> 01:23:20.564]  The websites are JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.net, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:23:28.439 --> 01:23:31.542]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[01:23:31.682 --> 01:23:34.764]  Let's talk to Wade in South Carolina.
[01:23:34.784 --> 01:23:35.625]  Thanks for holding, Wade.
[01:23:36.646 --> 01:23:37.086]  Good evening.
[01:23:38.187 --> 01:23:40.029]  I have to say, you're a national hero.
[01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:42.991]  You truly are a treasure of this country.
[01:23:43.832 --> 01:23:45.954]  And all your work is very fine.
[01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:46.754]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:23:46.794 --> 01:23:47.635]  I'm just doing my duty.
[01:23:48.015 --> 01:23:49.076]  Yes, sir, you are indeed.
[01:23:50.467 --> 01:23:51.647]  In every American's beauty.
[01:23:51.887 --> 01:23:55.448]  I'd like to talk briefly, if I could, about giving up our rights.
[01:23:55.928 --> 01:23:56.208]  Yes.
[01:23:56.688 --> 01:24:01.769]  And the overwhelming abuse of the FBI, of the Bill of Rights.
[01:24:03.190 --> 01:24:07.611]  Everything from government intrusion, to wiretapping, to entrapment.
[01:24:09.051 --> 01:24:13.492]  I want to kind of warn the people that these things are very real and are going on daily.
[01:24:15.812 --> 01:24:18.213]  I have a small investment group and
[01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:27.303]  And because of one disgruntled member, they have turned and attacked our entire 40-man membership group.
[01:24:28.204 --> 01:24:33.930]  And I want to talk briefly, if I could, about the abuse of national security letters.
[01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:35.712]  143,000 national security letters went out.
[01:24:40.521 --> 01:24:42.842]  Demanding information with a gag order on top of it.
[01:24:42.882 --> 01:25:06.432]  And by the way, exactly, and that's under the Patriot Act, under one of its subsections, it doesn't, what is it, 213, it doesn't, it isn't a warrant, it isn't a judge, it isn't anything, it's just these letters, and with one letter they just totally erase the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and then place a gag order on top of it, telling you you can't tell anybody that they violated your rights.
[01:25:06.732 --> 01:25:08.913]  That's exactly right, and so it's
[01:25:09.378 --> 01:25:15.601]  It's the same as breaking into your home and getting information, and then you can't say that they took it.
[01:25:15.621 --> 01:25:17.242]  Well, that's actually in the Patriot Act, too.
[01:25:17.282 --> 01:25:18.363]  That's sneak and peek.
[01:25:18.723 --> 01:25:20.203]  That's the sneak and peek provision.
[01:25:20.404 --> 01:25:22.485]  That's exactly right.
[01:25:22.525 --> 01:25:29.928]  With this 143,000 NSLs on private citizens, one conviction has come forth.
[01:25:31.089 --> 01:25:37.272]  An example of this is they got access to 11,000 computer phone numbers
[01:25:37.788 --> 01:25:41.490]  And the databases they're in, with only nine NSLs.
[01:25:43.451 --> 01:25:44.912]  So... Yeah, that's an example.
[01:25:44.952 --> 01:25:52.337]  It isn't a specific, we need a warrant to go here, because we think Billy Bob's got a trunkload of methamphetamine in his basement.
[01:25:52.657 --> 01:25:56.119]  This is just, with one letter, thousands of people are spied on.
[01:25:56.639 --> 01:25:57.500]  Sure, abusive.
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:03.904]  It's, you know, the Bill of Rights actually supersedes the Constitution.
[01:26:04.824 --> 01:26:22.971]  And for me, personally, I was in the military during the height of the Cold War, in the early 80s and mid-80s, right when Ronald Reagan was calling the Russians the evil empire, and we thought we might have to go to war to defend the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and was prepared to do so with our lives.
[01:26:23.531 --> 01:26:32.135]  And so for them to turn and then just act like the Bill of Rights is just a regular piece of paper or something is phenomenal, to say the least.
[01:26:32.805 --> 01:26:36.527]  It's all your scenarios and the things that you warn the people about.
[01:26:37.408 --> 01:26:41.070]  But I want to let you know that they don't care about your rights.
[01:26:42.971 --> 01:26:48.794]  In one case, I've got an attorney and they're actually behind the scenes trying to control my attorney.
[01:26:50.375 --> 01:26:55.918]  In Virginia, a man made a movie about 50,000 copies.
[01:26:56.358 --> 01:27:02.141]  He made a movie, similar to your movies, that showed government scandals and it was said to me
[01:27:02.954 --> 01:27:26.327]  By reliable sources that they come out and threaten that man with murder if he didn't stop his production and so he said he wouldn't be threatened like that and he warned his friends that he had been told this and a few weeks later that man was found dead and all 50,000 copies of this movie is missing but there is a couple that survived that
[01:27:28.432 --> 01:27:38.640]  Well, you know, I'm worried about people that don't threaten you, but I get plenty of threats, and actually, a lot of times I don't have energy, and then I get a death threat, and that just energizes me to just fight that much harder.
[01:27:39.141 --> 01:27:49.389]  See, a lot of these mainline people out there have never really investigated, and they've never faced up to how corrupt things are, but I've had the globalists, you know, offer for me to join them.
[01:27:49.909 --> 01:27:50.730]  I've been threatened.
[01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:51.871]  I've been physically attacked.
[01:27:52.411 --> 01:27:54.473]  I mean, and that's when you know how real it is.
[01:27:54.533 --> 01:27:56.054]  I mean, this is the real world.
[01:27:57.072 --> 01:28:01.814]  And, again, we just can't turn our country over to these people.
[01:28:02.755 --> 01:28:03.795]  We cannot do it.
[01:28:04.515 --> 01:28:07.657]  And, again, it's just like when we say the Masons run everything.
[01:28:07.697 --> 01:28:08.757]  It isn't all the Masons.
[01:28:08.797 --> 01:28:11.638]  It's compartmentalized, where we say the FBI is corrupt.
[01:28:11.698 --> 01:28:12.439]  It's the system.
[01:28:12.479 --> 01:28:13.279]  It's the laws.
[01:28:13.359 --> 01:28:14.360]  It's the regulations.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.280]  It's not the whole FBI.
[01:28:17.421 --> 01:28:20.262]  But, regardless, when the system's corrupt, they're all part of it.
[01:28:20.282 --> 01:28:21.243]  They're all on the same ship.
[01:28:21.283 --> 01:28:22.203]  We're on the same ship.
[01:28:23.252 --> 01:28:25.634]  And these are the times that drives men's souls.
[01:28:25.714 --> 01:28:27.876]  I appreciate your call, Wade.
[01:28:28.576 --> 01:28:32.740]  Tom, Joe, and many others, your calls are straight ahead on the other side.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.881]  And you want to talk about ours.
[01:28:34.701 --> 01:28:37.624]  Our weakest individuals are the ones that are under attack.
[01:28:38.484 --> 01:28:39.705]  And we're going to be talking about that.
[01:28:39.725 --> 01:28:40.126]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.849 --> 01:28:44.749]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:46.851]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.752 --> 01:28:50.454]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.577 --> 01:28:54.977]  Attention!
[01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:57.899]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:28:58.199 --> 01:29:02.502]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:29:02.822 --> 01:29:03.503]  Listen closely.
[01:29:04.163 --> 01:29:11.628]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:29:11.928 --> 01:29:20.674]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:29:20.994 --> 01:29:26.502]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:29:26.782 --> 01:29:36.196]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:29:36.476 --> 01:29:42.078]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:42.259 --> 01:29:45.840]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:29:46.060 --> 01:29:49.402]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:55.635 --> 01:29:59.696]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:30:00.477 --> 01:30:08.319]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:08.799 --> 01:30:20.903]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:20.983 --> 01:30:21.483]  Central.
[01:30:21.883 --> 01:30:23.764]  Formidable Alex Jones says,
[01:30:24.517 --> 01:30:28.238]  This is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:30:28.918 --> 01:30:35.260]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:40.882]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:41.622 --> 01:30:47.144]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:47.524 --> 01:30:48.904]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:48.984 --> 01:30:51.045]  Central with The Divided Kingdom,
[01:30:55.976 --> 01:31:00.099]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:31:00.339 --> 01:31:02.100]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:08.644]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:31:08.945 --> 01:31:15.069]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:31:15.309 --> 01:31:21.333]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:31:21.613 --> 01:31:28.016]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:31:28.176 --> 01:31:31.717]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:31:32.018 --> 01:31:35.719]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:31:35.899 --> 01:31:38.440]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:38.581 --> 01:31:39.641]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:39.921 --> 01:31:40.942]  Eliminate the cause!
[01:31:41.102 --> 01:31:44.063]  For more information call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625 That's 1-866-885-6625 1-866-885-6625
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:57.203]  In constant sorrow, he says, I am the man.
[01:32:18.064 --> 01:32:41.897]  I'm a man of constant sorrow I've seen trouble all my day I bid farewell to old Kentucky The place where I was born and raised The place where he was born and raised
[01:32:55.408 --> 01:32:57.390]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:32:57.450 --> 01:32:58.230]  until 2 p.m.
[01:32:59.031 --> 01:33:00.112]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:00.132 --> 01:33:05.195]  We're here live.
[01:33:05.936 --> 01:33:12.060]  I remember when I first got on air about 13 years ago on local cable and then 12 years ago on radio.
[01:33:13.001 --> 01:33:22.308]  I was mainly doing a local show and I would get called to a hospital by listeners.
[01:33:25.319 --> 01:33:31.243]  And in some cases, it would even be friends of friends, and they'd be there taking some young couple's firstborn child.
[01:33:33.204 --> 01:33:37.306]  And then I've told a famous case where I caught the cop choking the woman into signing an agreement.
[01:33:37.426 --> 01:33:39.968]  I mean, I opened the door, it was like out of a movie, and you catch him red-handed.
[01:33:41.108 --> 01:33:42.329]  And that freaked me out.
[01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:47.912]  I got in the car and was driving out of there, and called into some talk show and broke down crying.
[01:33:47.932 --> 01:33:48.693]  I mean, that was...
[01:33:49.597 --> 01:33:52.980]  That was kind of a coming of age for me to realize these people are evil folks.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.023]  There's evil people and they're in positions of power and they like what they do.
[01:33:58.145 --> 01:34:03.069]  And then I remember following cases from start to finish where they would just lie to get the orders signed by judges.
[01:34:03.109 --> 01:34:04.671]  These aren't even real courts to begin with.
[01:34:06.733 --> 01:34:08.975]  They would just make up things that didn't even exist.
[01:34:10.474 --> 01:34:12.295]  They would claim things and claim visits.
[01:34:12.815 --> 01:34:22.979]  They would say abuse a year ago when the CPS worker had just been called to the house a day before because a three-year-old was in the backyard playing with their cars and mama was watching them out the window in the sandbox.
[01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:25.000]  Everything we did as children.
[01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:37.385]  And then I learned the University of Texas main textbook says the family's a disease and has to be eradicated and then I interviewed the number two of the Department of
[01:34:38.072 --> 01:34:42.817]  Education, Charlotte Isderby, whose dad was a big, you know, skeleton bones, bohemian grove guy.
[01:34:42.837 --> 01:34:44.138]  That's why she got the big job there.
[01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.099]  Plus, she's a smart lady.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:48.422]  And it was openly, they were saying, it was a plan to dumb everybody down.
[01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:57.872]  And since then, I've learned that social workers were set up, turn of the last century, over a hundred years ago now, by eugenics.
[01:34:57.972 --> 01:34:59.353]  Eugenicists took over the government.
[01:34:59.874 --> 01:35:02.076]  The King of England and the Queen of England supported it.
[01:35:02.808 --> 01:35:06.470]  They were all ready into breeding and that they wanted to go around and sterilize the poor.
[01:35:07.070 --> 01:35:10.311]  They already tried exporting them to America and Australia and places like that.
[01:35:10.952 --> 01:35:15.153]  And they wanted to, there were open discussions of killing large portions of Ireland.
[01:35:15.173 --> 01:35:21.136]  There were mainline front page papers saying, should we just kill the Irish?
[01:35:21.156 --> 01:35:24.077]  Should we just go ahead and sterilize them and kill the rest?
[01:35:25.358 --> 01:35:29.880]  So, because they're a genetic scourge and all the rest of it, great Irish people.
[01:35:31.132 --> 01:35:34.435]  And again, this wasn't the British people doing this, it was the elite running things.
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:52.152]  So I learned that years ago, but now I've read documents and how it all started, and millions of people in the US and Europe, how our government started the whole Nazi system, and the first deaths were CPS.
[01:35:52.693 --> 01:35:55.756]  They would come take retarded children, even mildly retarded, and they would kill them.
[01:35:56.886 --> 01:35:59.227]  If the family wanted the child killed, they'd publicly kill them.
[01:35:59.767 --> 01:36:02.648]  If they didn't want the child killed, they'd tell them they had a ruptured appendix.
[01:36:03.448 --> 01:36:06.069]  Even though, in many cases, the children already had their appendices removed.
[01:36:06.089 --> 01:36:07.289]  That's pretty famous.
[01:36:07.949 --> 01:36:10.410]  Just type in how the Holocaust started.
[01:36:10.810 --> 01:36:16.212]  And they killed long before 1939, when the war started with Czechoslovakia and then Poland.
[01:36:16.852 --> 01:36:21.314]  They started... Child and Family Service is what it was called.
[01:36:23.414 --> 01:36:25.355]  Folk Services is the translation.
[01:36:26.713 --> 01:36:27.133]  We're good to go.
[01:36:56.448 --> 01:36:59.530]  Where it shows what was really happening in the country.
[01:37:01.051 --> 01:37:05.934]  And so the first CPS didn't claim neglect, didn't claim spanking was bad, didn't claim all this.
[01:37:06.494 --> 01:37:12.157]  They just came by and they would take children, not just in Germany, but in the U.S.
[01:37:12.197 --> 01:37:14.418]  they would deny you food and water and just let you die.
[01:37:15.479 --> 01:37:16.920]  The Soviets also adopted it.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.001]  And others they would sterilize.
[01:37:19.982 --> 01:37:21.302]  Do you have that Tomorrow's Children clip?
[01:37:23.644 --> 01:37:25.145]  I know I just sprung it on you, John.
[01:37:29.537 --> 01:37:30.077]  Well, you know what?
[01:37:30.497 --> 01:37:31.497]  We'll play that clip later.
[01:37:31.537 --> 01:37:33.058]  I'm unable to... Uh-oh.
[01:37:33.818 --> 01:37:34.198]  You have it?
[01:37:34.218 --> 01:37:36.098]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play that.
[01:37:36.158 --> 01:37:38.819]  Here's Tamar's children, and we'll go to our guest.
[01:37:38.839 --> 01:37:44.179]  Because I want you to know, it's not just CPS out of control, or they're misguided, or they don't know what they're doing.
[01:37:44.219 --> 01:37:46.380]  This is world family planning.
[01:37:46.420 --> 01:37:47.140]  This is Eugenics.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.580]  Here it is, and we'll go to our guest.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.541]  Excuse everybody, where's Tamar?
[01:37:52.581 --> 01:37:55.401]  She didn't get sick again.
[01:37:55.421 --> 01:37:57.142]  Are you Alex Mason?
[01:37:57.182 --> 01:37:57.562]  Uh, yes.
[01:37:57.962 --> 01:37:58.922]  But where are my other kids?
[01:37:59.599 --> 01:38:01.799]  Well, they're all safe, so there's nothing for you to worry about.
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:02.900]  Now, sit down.
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:04.100]  I want to talk to them.
[01:38:06.981 --> 01:38:08.821]  I'm Mrs. Wright of the Welfare Association.
[01:38:09.481 --> 01:38:11.041]  You're 17, aren't you, Alice?
[01:38:11.802 --> 01:38:13.642]  Yes, but what have you done with my folks?
[01:38:14.242 --> 01:38:16.202]  Well, we're trying to help them, Alice, and you too.
[01:38:17.163 --> 01:38:19.143]  They were taken to the hospital this afternoon.
[01:38:19.283 --> 01:38:19.763]  Hospital?
[01:38:20.163 --> 01:38:21.483]  Wasn't none of them sick this morning?
[01:38:22.344 --> 01:38:23.384]  My isn't worse, is she?
[01:38:24.184 --> 01:38:24.744]  Where's Pa?
[01:38:25.324 --> 01:38:26.805]  He's gone to the hospital too, Alice.
[01:38:27.625 --> 01:38:28.585]  I don't see what for.
[01:38:29.887 --> 01:38:31.168]  You're sure you didn't put him in jail?
[01:38:31.188 --> 01:38:32.129]  Of course not.
[01:38:32.469 --> 01:38:33.770]  I said we were trying to help him.
[01:38:33.970 --> 01:38:34.871]  You better tell her.
[01:38:36.012 --> 01:38:36.872]  So she'll understand.
[01:38:37.453 --> 01:38:41.896]  Well, we thought it necessary to present your family's case to the state medical commission.
[01:38:42.657 --> 01:38:46.700]  After an examination, they decided it was of one important action to take.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:50.303]  To have your entire family sterilized.
[01:38:50.863 --> 01:38:51.624]  Why, what's that?
[01:38:52.084 --> 01:38:53.385]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:38:53.665 --> 01:38:55.707]  Well, we investigated your family's history, Alice.
[01:38:56.728 --> 01:38:59.490]  And those of the past three generations have been feeble-minded.
[01:39:00.379 --> 01:39:04.461]  Some genital cripples or habitual drunkenness.
[01:39:04.581 --> 01:39:07.483]  Instead of improving, each generation is more of a problem.
[01:39:08.283 --> 01:39:14.026]  Now in this state, we have a law which provides for such people to have an operation so there won't be any more children.
[01:39:14.967 --> 01:39:15.427]  I see.
[01:39:16.328 --> 01:39:19.309]  I'll replace your brothers in institutions where they'll be properly cared for.
[01:39:19.329 --> 01:39:21.811]  I'm going to go back to your job soon.
[01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:23.872]  I'll arrange to have it held open for you.
[01:39:24.312 --> 01:39:25.953]  But I'm keeping my job.
[01:39:26.013 --> 01:39:27.134]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:39:27.154 --> 01:39:29.555]  Now you're going to the hospital too, Ralph.
[01:39:30.385 --> 01:39:31.706]  But there's nothing wrong with me.
[01:39:32.406 --> 01:39:33.026]  Perhaps not.
[01:39:34.527 --> 01:39:38.209]  You wouldn't want to marry such a fine young man and be ashamed of the children you have.
[01:39:38.749 --> 01:39:41.511]  And you mean they're going to stop me from having children ever?
[01:39:43.091 --> 01:39:43.652]  Exactly.
[01:39:44.792 --> 01:39:45.693]  I'm all right, I tell you.
[01:39:45.753 --> 01:39:46.833]  I won't go to any hospital.
[01:39:46.853 --> 01:39:49.755]  Now Alex, you must be reasonable.
[01:39:49.895 --> 01:39:55.958]  Now we got a court order that besides your parents gave permission, you'll get a chance to tell your side of it in court.
[01:39:56.664 --> 01:39:57.745]  I won't go, I tell you.
[01:39:58.245 --> 01:39:59.766]  We don't want any trouble with you, young woman.
[01:40:00.347 --> 01:40:02.728]  If you refuse to go, the officer here will take you by force.
[01:40:06.351 --> 01:40:06.671]  All right.
[01:40:07.171 --> 01:40:08.072]  Maybe I'd better go.
[01:40:08.092 --> 01:40:10.393]  There might be a chance of me in court.
[01:40:11.354 --> 01:40:11.514]  Sure.
[01:40:11.674 --> 01:40:12.375]  Of course.
[01:40:13.455 --> 01:40:15.417]  You don't mind if I go to my room and get some things?
[01:40:16.177 --> 01:40:16.718]  I'll need them.
[01:40:17.098 --> 01:40:17.899]  Go right ahead.
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:19.940]  Alice Mason.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.401]  Come on, Jim.
[01:40:28.257 --> 01:40:29.358]  Are you interested in this case?
[01:40:29.458 --> 01:40:30.098]  Yes, Your Honor.
[01:40:30.519 --> 01:40:32.260]  I'm Dr. Brooks of the County Hospital.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.361]  This is Jim Baker, Miss Mason's fiance.
[01:40:35.402 --> 01:40:36.643]  What testimony have you to offer?
[01:40:37.123 --> 01:40:40.605]  In the case of Miss Mason, I can see no reason for the operation that's been recommended.
[01:40:41.046 --> 01:40:42.206]  The girl is perfectly normal.
[01:40:42.707 --> 01:40:44.588]  She's hardworking and has a good reputation.
[01:40:44.888 --> 01:40:46.749]  Do you know anything about her family background?
[01:40:47.290 --> 01:40:48.090]  Yes, Your Honor, I do.
[01:40:48.310 --> 01:40:49.971]  There are several other children, aren't there?
[01:40:50.272 --> 01:40:50.512]  Yes.
[01:40:50.892 --> 01:40:51.713]  What is their condition?
[01:40:53.194 --> 01:40:55.255]  One is a cripple, two others might be classes.
[01:40:55.965 --> 01:40:56.545]  People minded.
[01:40:56.746 --> 01:40:58.226]  Isn't the oldest son in jail?
[01:40:58.246 --> 01:40:59.928]  Well, yes, I believe so.
[01:41:00.368 --> 01:41:05.191]  And knowing all that, you still contend that this girl should be allowed to bring more people like that into the world?
[01:41:05.531 --> 01:41:06.912]  She's sound, Your Honor.
[01:41:07.212 --> 01:41:08.393]  She's not anything like the rest.
[01:41:09.073 --> 01:41:11.695]  Surely she should be given a chance to work out her own salvation.
[01:41:11.875 --> 01:41:13.196]  I can't agree with you, Doctor.
[01:41:13.596 --> 01:41:14.717]  Suppose she is normal.
[01:41:15.317 --> 01:41:17.979]  The chances are that her children will inherit the family fame.
[01:41:18.459 --> 01:41:19.139]  Isn't that possible?
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.141]  But, Your Honor, I... I'm sorry, Doctor.
[01:41:22.161 --> 01:41:24.803]  Three generations of unfit are enough.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:33.662]  Now, I told the story, and we're going to our guest, and I'm going to hold him over for past the half hour, next hour, she has plenty of time.
[01:41:34.782 --> 01:41:37.823]  I told it on Sunday's syndicated show I'm doing now from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:41:37.863 --> 01:41:38.223]  Central.
[01:41:39.623 --> 01:41:46.145]  On that Saturday, I went to a recital my daughter was having, and my parents came over to the house and they rode with us.
[01:41:48.146 --> 01:41:52.168]  And my mother's like, I heard your Friday show on eugenics, and is it really that bad?
[01:41:52.188 --> 01:41:55.911]  They really are in all the major positions of power, and that guides society.
[01:41:55.971 --> 01:41:56.751]  My mom's pretty smart.
[01:41:56.771 --> 01:41:57.732]  She's got several degrees.
[01:41:58.672 --> 01:41:59.453]  Big history buff.
[01:41:59.533 --> 01:42:01.014]  And she goes, I know there's a lot of it.
[01:42:01.054 --> 01:42:03.155]  I've read a lot about it, but are you seeing it that big?
[01:42:03.175 --> 01:42:06.617]  And I said, Mom, I didn't know how big it was.
[01:42:06.697 --> 01:42:07.938]  They literally run everything.
[01:42:09.279 --> 01:42:11.760]  And my dad always holds his cards close to his chest.
[01:42:11.780 --> 01:42:12.821]  He's a pretty quiet guy.
[01:42:13.721 --> 01:42:16.283]  But he was top of his class in school, and
[01:42:18.061 --> 01:42:42.013]  I know he worked at MD Anderson when he was like a sophomore and then a junior he went to UT for you know the big whatever International Science Academy or whatever it was the best and brightest the salutatorians and valedictorians and it was a couple hundred kids from the state of Texas and there was the big head of one of the biology departments famous professor turned out my mother had had him too at UT and so had my wife before he died
[01:42:43.118 --> 01:42:45.379]  And they called him aside.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:52.103]  The cream of that group they called aside and said, listen, there's a technocracy that runs America.
[01:42:52.543 --> 01:42:55.465]  You can join us and eugenics is our system.
[01:42:56.425 --> 01:43:07.912]  And then my dad, you know, ended up going off to college, you know, taking the quick route because my mother was pregnant and they got married and he went to dental school because that was the quickest route to get some money quickly.
[01:43:08.172 --> 01:43:10.053]  Thank God he never went off into all of that.
[01:43:11.208 --> 01:43:13.109]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:15.949]  They're recruiting and my dad told my mom that and she was like, whoa!
[01:43:16.890 --> 01:43:20.711]  And then just last night I pulled the actual numbers for Endgame on Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:43:21.451 --> 01:43:27.733]  They had given already $3 billion exclusively to eugenics organizations and population reduction groups.
[01:43:28.293 --> 01:43:30.873]  Now they've given an additional $30 billion.
[01:43:31.794 --> 01:43:34.634]  Warren Buffett gave $37 billion.
[01:43:34.654 --> 01:43:37.175]  Of course you know about Ted Turner and his billion.
[01:43:37.215 --> 01:43:38.496]  Now more than a billion he's given.
[01:43:41.445 --> 01:43:42.886]  Anyways, I'm going to shut up and go to our guest.
[01:43:43.106 --> 01:43:44.427]  I think we had him on years ago.
[01:43:45.568 --> 01:43:47.129]  MassOutrage.com.
[01:43:47.289 --> 01:43:48.810]  M-A-S-S-Outrage.com.
[01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:50.492]  Mainly focusing on Massachusetts.
[01:43:50.552 --> 01:43:53.514]  I mean, it's one of the worst states out there because of the socialism.
[01:43:54.415 --> 01:43:57.537]  And I saw him in a JBS article out there fighting the corruption.
[01:43:57.557 --> 01:44:05.723]  I thought we ought to have him on because the tactics he's learned, the tricks he's learned that they use, and the ways to fight them are effective in all 50 states.
[01:44:06.683 --> 01:44:08.625]  And they grab over a million children a year.
[01:44:09.625 --> 01:44:16.671]  CPS is five times more likely to abuse or kill children than any other group.
[01:44:17.111 --> 01:44:18.872]  The most dangerous group is CPS.
[01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:20.093]  That is federal numbers.
[01:44:20.113 --> 01:44:21.294]  They don't like to advertise those.
[01:44:21.615 --> 01:44:22.075]  Five times.
[01:44:22.876 --> 01:44:26.618]  Though that has been on the cover of Time Magazine, I remember back in 2000, the shame of foster care.
[01:44:26.639 --> 01:44:27.599]  I'm surprised it was there.
[01:44:27.619 --> 01:44:29.080]  But their answer was, more money.
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.043]  Oh, see, we're so abusive, we need more money.
[01:44:32.303 --> 01:44:33.444]  That's why we're doing this.
[01:44:33.804 --> 01:44:36.026]  See, problem, reaction, solution, so they can do even more.
[01:44:36.954 --> 01:44:39.580]  And now they've grabbed most of the poor children, targeting them.
[01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.585]  Now they're moving on to rich people and middle class.
[01:44:42.607 --> 01:44:45.594]  And most of them are pedophiles, a large percentage of pedophiles.
[01:44:46.752 --> 01:44:53.056]  Or mentally ill, or abused themselves, and now they think they're punishing their mommy and daddy by punishing you.
[01:44:53.356 --> 01:44:54.557]  They're total basket cases.
[01:44:54.817 --> 01:44:57.479]  Now that certain social workers, there's other social workers that aren't.
[01:44:57.859 --> 01:45:00.881]  It's those certain gills, the actual child snatchers.
[01:45:01.101 --> 01:45:01.861]  And how do they do that?
[01:45:02.321 --> 01:45:08.125]  Federal statistic, I heard on NPR just last year, half of social workers nationally quit in the first year.
[01:45:08.712 --> 01:45:09.532]  No, I had not heard that clip before.
[01:45:33.618 --> 01:45:36.861]  But there are probably some other backstories as well.
[01:45:36.941 --> 01:45:43.186]  I think there's a lot of forces and factors that contribute to our current problem that we have with CPS.
[01:45:43.647 --> 01:45:46.349]  Well let me just ask you, because for ten minutes I went through a diatribe.
[01:45:46.609 --> 01:45:53.836]  Do you have any comments on the statements I made or on the numbers I gave or just how bad this really is?
[01:45:53.856 --> 01:45:55.077]  No, I agree with you completely.
[01:45:55.377 --> 01:45:56.138]  I couldn't have any
[01:45:57.990 --> 01:46:02.352]  Disagreement at all with you, and I believe your statistics that you cite are correct.
[01:46:02.552 --> 01:46:15.578]  In the article I just wrote, another astounding statistic is there are 3.3 million calls to child abuse hotlines every year in the United States, involving 6 million children a year.
[01:46:16.639 --> 01:46:18.640]  And that means an awful lot of families.
[01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:23.092]  get caught in the web of this problem on a yearly basis.
[01:46:23.152 --> 01:46:29.437]  And now they're telling doctors and nurses, the lady that cuts your hair, I mean kids get bumps and scrapes, they're all being told to be spies.
[01:46:30.137 --> 01:46:33.560]  That's right, and I call it in that article the snitch network.
[01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:46.810]  I think there's very little difference between that snitch network as it currently operates and what you see in Cuba or the former Soviet republics that if a neighbor doesn't like you, they can snitch.
[01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:56.512]  If the school teacher, or in a divorce situation, if one spouse wants to use CPS as a weapon, it's easy.
[01:46:56.552 --> 01:47:01.934]  They just call, allege some kind of abuse, and the game is on.
[01:47:02.274 --> 01:47:04.154]  These people are such dupes.
[01:47:04.314 --> 01:47:06.135]  They have no clue how to investigate.
[01:47:06.175 --> 01:47:08.115]  They get it wrong both ways.
[01:47:09.896 --> 01:47:15.477]  But as you pointed out, and I'm glad you do, because so few people ever really go back into what you said, the backstory.
[01:47:16.181 --> 01:47:19.722]  There's also another backstory, I think, that's applicable, if you'd like me to go into that.
[01:47:19.762 --> 01:47:20.282]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:47:21.623 --> 01:47:30.406]  If you look back at the turn of the century, in the 20th century, there was this great optimism about the world becoming socialist.
[01:47:31.206 --> 01:47:34.787]  And right before World War I... No, that's it!
[01:47:34.827 --> 01:47:36.128]  It's Bertrand Russell and the British!
[01:47:36.188 --> 01:47:38.348]  It's the Fabian Socialists, yeah!
[01:47:38.749 --> 01:47:42.770]  But in this country, also, there was a great movement involving
[01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:50.712]  number of well-known intellectuals that wanted to use the war as a means to complete its socialist objectives.
[01:47:51.552 --> 01:48:06.836]  And everybody, you know, at the time who was, you know, the intellectuals at the time, of course, believed that socialism was going to finally bring about the great world peace, and they thought the war actually would be a great means to bring that about.
[01:48:07.748 --> 01:48:13.733]  And often times it was the liberal Christians who were at the vanguard of this.
[01:48:14.133 --> 01:48:28.085]  Well, no, but the liberal Christian churches, particularly in the Northeast, felt that the government would be the means to bring about this socialist end.
[01:48:28.605 --> 01:48:31.988]  They were, I guess what you could call, pietists.
[01:48:32.849 --> 01:48:36.492]  They believed that you could, you know, fix man by
[01:48:37.213 --> 01:48:41.075]  Simply bringing a lot more government regulation and control into effect.
[01:48:41.175 --> 01:48:42.776]  And the church just bought into this.
[01:48:43.597 --> 01:48:47.399]  And the profession of social work really began to come into its own there.
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:52.682]  The anti-drinking crusade started around that time.
[01:48:52.722 --> 01:48:55.364]  That was one of their pet projects.
[01:48:55.444 --> 01:49:01.548]  It was really just a giant horde of control freaks being used by the bigger crime bosses.
[01:49:02.382 --> 01:49:02.863]  Exactly.
[01:49:04.564 --> 01:49:21.259]  But the profession of social work came into its own at that point in a much more popular fashion and they began to expand and grow and as you say, became allied with all these other philosophical kin such as the eugenics movement and others.
[01:49:21.539 --> 01:49:23.541]  But the profession of social work saw their
[01:49:26.841 --> 01:49:33.984]  Their opportunity to expand this and use government as a tool to fix everybody.
[01:49:34.665 --> 01:49:40.908]  They didn't see their... They didn't understand the gospel rightly that it's obviously God who fixes us inside.
[01:49:41.288 --> 01:49:43.850]  They thought government could fix people from the outside.
[01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.830]  What a surprise!
[01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:46.811]  A bunch of control freaks thinking they're God.
[01:49:46.871 --> 01:49:47.552]  Stay there.
[01:49:47.912 --> 01:49:50.173]  Let's walk through it with our guest, Greg Hessen.
[01:49:57.032 --> 01:50:00.234]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.554 --> 01:50:02.495]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.856 --> 01:50:10.500]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.201 --> 01:50:18.224]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.644 --> 01:50:30.069]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.389 --> 01:50:33.911]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.351 --> 01:50:36.312]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.612 --> 01:50:40.454]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:54.335 --> 01:51:58.197]  Did you know that the water you drink every day can be even more beneficial to your health?
[01:51:58.457 --> 01:52:02.318]  I'm not talking so-called enriched water, but I'm talking about electrolyzed water.
[01:52:02.679 --> 01:52:07.701]  RPA Biotech is an amazing American company that provides unique technology to transform water.
[01:52:07.981 --> 01:52:19.166]  Electrolyzed Plus Water will alkalinize your water more powerfully than any other single nutraceutical because a body in an alkaline state can't grow pathogens, become allergic, or develop autoimmune disease or vascular degenerative illness.
[01:52:19.486 --> 01:52:23.848]  Electrolyzed water is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and environmentally safe for humans and animals.
[01:52:24.089 --> 01:52:33.414]  Alkaline water is available as a concentrate to be mixed with good, filtered, purified, RO water but not tap water, micro-structured alkaline antioxidant water for consumption.
[01:52:33.574 --> 01:52:41.458]  Call for your Electrolyzed Plus Alkalinizing Miracle Rejuvenating Water Concentrate or other remarkable RPA Biotech products like Ultimate Fuel,

[01:52:49.942 --> 01:52:52.803]  That's N-U-T-R-I with an I. Medical.com.
[01:52:53.723 --> 01:52:59.406]  The next stop that we make will be mine.
[01:52:59.546 --> 01:53:02.507]  Tell all the folks in Russia and China too.
[01:53:14.778 --> 01:53:28.064]  I've found masses of quotes where in the 1920s and 30s these social workers were talking about how they were going to inject children with poisonous vaccines to brain damage them to make them submit.
[01:53:29.084 --> 01:53:32.846]  So it's not just a bunch of buffoon mainline Christians
[01:53:34.253 --> 01:53:46.230]  It's the establishment selling them on it and telling a bunch of ninnying control freaks down at the local church who just want an excuse to go around bossing everyone around that, you know, that they're God's gift to the planet.
[01:53:47.512 --> 01:53:49.936]  That's why they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:53:51.515 --> 01:53:59.097]  Going back to Greg Hessen, we've got an incredible website, MassOutrage.com, and it's up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com right now.
[01:53:59.757 --> 01:54:00.697]  We have links to it.
[01:54:00.737 --> 01:54:06.159]  We're going to be taking your calls in the next hour with your CPS horror stories or asking advice of this gentleman.
[01:54:06.759 --> 01:54:15.241]  Greg, it might be politer of me, you have a huge bio here, but why don't you just tell folks in a nutshell about yourself and who you are and the saga you've been through.
[01:54:16.769 --> 01:54:18.449]  I'm a lawyer in the state of Massachusetts.
[01:54:18.509 --> 01:54:22.691]  I graduated from law school in 1993 and was admitted to the bar here.
[01:54:24.351 --> 01:54:30.753]  I did not have any idea when I got out of law school that this was going to be the issue that I would end up backing into.
[01:54:31.213 --> 01:54:36.094]  I was interested in the issues of taxation.
[01:54:36.295 --> 01:54:39.215]  I was supporting the anti-tax movement.
[01:54:39.235 --> 01:54:44.257]  I was interested in the issues of pro-life, which of course are critical issues.
[01:54:45.490 --> 01:54:50.014]  When in 1995, when I did my first case with CPS, I could not believe it.
[01:54:51.155 --> 01:54:57.480]  They took a child for what appeared to me to be absolutely no reason whatsoever, and I couldn't get the child back for a year.
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:00.542]  We eventually did, but I've never seen anything like it.
[01:55:00.582 --> 01:55:01.803]  There's no due process.
[01:55:02.164 --> 01:55:07.528]  The courts are closed in almost every state so that there's secret tribunals
[01:55:08.211 --> 01:55:11.592]  That the press and the public are excluded from, so there's no accountability.
[01:55:11.612 --> 01:55:14.013]  And that's because they created these courts the last hundred years.
[01:55:14.033 --> 01:55:15.774]  They're not really constitutional courts.
[01:55:16.394 --> 01:55:18.535]  Well, they're completely unconstitutional.
[01:55:18.595 --> 01:55:22.076]  They don't use the rules of civil procedure that every other court uses.
[01:55:22.496 --> 01:55:26.037]  They don't use the rules of evidence that other courts use.
[01:55:26.297 --> 01:55:28.798]  So you can have hearsay upon hearsay upon hearsay.
[01:55:29.238 --> 01:55:36.401]  So, the kid says something to the social worker that says something to the other social worker, and then it's allowed into evidence, which you could never do in any other court.
[01:55:37.041 --> 01:55:46.224]  And all of these things contribute to a... but it's all because of this idea of necessity.
[01:55:46.244 --> 01:55:49.905]  You know, we have to protect children against child abuse, which is a truism.
[01:55:49.965 --> 01:55:52.926]  Of course we have to, but this isn't the way to protect them.
[01:55:53.246 --> 01:55:58.148]  But meeting a child with a tire iron is a matter for the police and always had been.
[01:55:58.168 --> 01:55:58.988]  Always.
[01:55:59.368 --> 01:56:04.930]  And again, statistically five times more likely because if you're a sicko,
[01:56:05.797 --> 01:56:06.217]  You don't.
[01:56:06.818 --> 01:56:09.560]  You go become a CPS worker, folks.
[01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:10.681]  That's what people understand.
[01:56:10.701 --> 01:56:14.384]  Well, you know, a lot of them become, but I'll tell you the dirty little secret about that.
[01:56:14.404 --> 01:56:18.928]  A lot of them become social workers with CPS because that's how they get their state license.
[01:56:18.968 --> 01:56:20.249]  You have to have so many hours.
[01:56:20.609 --> 01:56:25.734]  So you put in your time with them and then leave as soon as you get the necessary hours to get your own license.
[01:56:26.554 --> 01:56:29.877]  We used unlicensed social workers.
[01:56:29.897 --> 01:56:34.681]  And they get their license by going to work for the state agency and that gives them the time.
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:37.704]  As soon as they can, they get out.
[01:56:42.952 --> 01:56:43.893]  I know what you're talking about.
[01:56:43.913 --> 01:56:44.513]  They're hideous humans.
[01:57:09.133 --> 01:57:12.255]  And if you ask them, why are you keeping this child, they almost never have an answer.
[01:57:12.515 --> 01:57:14.036]  Just because we have custody.
[01:57:15.157 --> 01:57:22.642]  And the whole system is set up on a number of very flawed premises.
[01:57:23.462 --> 01:57:28.346]  The proof level is so very low... Well stay there, let's talk about it.
[01:57:28.386 --> 01:57:31.828]  It's a kangaroo court, totally un-American, and they're spreading everywhere.

[01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:54.211]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.892 --> 01:57:55.692]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.452 --> 01:57:57.313]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.353 --> 01:58:01.695]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.195 --> 01:58:06.297]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.398 --> 01:58:17.263]  In like manner, the scientific rulers will provide one kind of education for ordinary men and women, and another for those who are to become holders of scientific power.
[01:58:19.085 --> 01:58:27.471]  Ordinary men and women will be expected to be docile, industrious, punctual, thoughtless and contented.
[01:58:28.511 --> 01:58:37.177]  And it goes on to say, gradually by selective breeding and congenital differences between rulers and ruled, will increase until they become almost different species.
[01:58:37.717 --> 01:58:44.342]  A revolt of the plebes will become as unthinkable as organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton,
[01:58:45.174 --> 01:58:53.944]  Diet injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[01:58:54.384 --> 01:58:58.749]  And any serious criticism of the powers that be will become psychologically impossible.
[01:58:59.289 --> 01:59:03.514]  Now that's one of the granddaddies of modern social work, and that's what they really think of us.
[01:59:04.447 --> 01:59:07.590]  Going back to our guest from MassOutrage.com, Greg Hessen.
[01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:10.272]  This is a quick segment, long 15-minute segment coming up.
[01:59:10.312 --> 01:59:11.173]  Sorry about these breaks.
[01:59:12.494 --> 01:59:13.595]  Please continue, sir.
[01:59:13.915 --> 01:59:21.222]  When you were going through the CPS courts as you began to fight them in 1995, a couple years out of law school, you'd been taught we still were a free country.
[01:59:21.242 --> 01:59:24.384]  You didn't know there was a whole parallel world of admiralty law.
[01:59:24.424 --> 01:59:25.025]  Please continue.
[01:59:25.849 --> 01:59:27.431]  I sure didn't.
[01:59:27.511 --> 01:59:29.252]  I'd never seen anything like it.
[01:59:29.292 --> 01:59:32.635]  They didn't use any of the rules that all of the other courts used.
[01:59:33.236 --> 01:59:35.798]  It was entirely irrational.
[01:59:36.460 --> 01:59:40.962]  It was almost a fantasy world that these people lived in.
[01:59:41.482 --> 01:59:59.769]  So I saw at that point that that's where I needed to go and most of my practice since that time has focused on defending parents who have lost their children to this monster or defending parents against false allegations of abuse that also are used in domestic abuse restraining orders which is another
[02:00:00.864 --> 02:00:03.447]  That means that families are ruined.
[02:00:03.487 --> 02:00:14.476]  Yeah, the state has trained us to be scum and go right on each other and under the modern feminist model, CIA run, that's declassified, to actually get men and women in each other's throats so the state could get the children.
[02:00:14.837 --> 02:00:21.903]  First thing Hitler did, again it all goes back to this model of breaking up the family so the state can reorganize and create this Valhalla.
[02:00:22.664 --> 02:00:23.264]  Exactly.
[02:00:23.805 --> 02:00:25.106]  You've hit it on the nub.
[02:00:26.301 --> 02:00:45.636]  uh... there are a few lawyers who really want to confront this monster because it's much easier to play ball with the establishment uh... and because i want to happen all the lawyers are yucking it up with the lawyers on the other side at the courthouse and the parents are crying but all the lawyers are laughing because they're getting paid
[02:00:47.136 --> 02:00:51.878]  It's a heartbreak to walk into a juvenile court and see the dynamic there.
[02:00:52.178 --> 02:00:53.138]  It's a terrible thing.
[02:00:53.538 --> 02:00:58.860]  And so I've stayed in Massachusetts because that's one of the states that does it the most and the worst.
[02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:04.963]  And I feel like, well, okay, here's an opportunity to do this where it's very needed.
[02:01:05.183 --> 02:01:07.723]  What do they think of you after all the years you've been fighting them?
[02:01:08.824 --> 02:01:09.104]  Pardon?
[02:01:10.134 --> 02:01:13.155]  What do these cockroaches do when they see you walk in the courtroom?
[02:01:13.775 --> 02:01:14.895]  Well, some of them don't like it.
[02:01:14.995 --> 02:01:22.817]  Some of them actually print out chunks of my website and give it to the judge and say, look, you should tell this guy he should be censored.
[02:01:23.158 --> 02:01:23.898]  It's unbelievable.
[02:01:23.958 --> 02:01:29.159]  I actually had one judge look at the CPS lawyer and say, have you ever heard of the First Amendment?
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:33.700]  So they're all the time causing problems.
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.342]  And the more you fight them, a lot of times, the more they dig in their heels because, frankly, they have the power.
[02:01:39.932 --> 02:01:43.795]  For the most part, they own the court, they own the judge, they own everything.
[02:01:44.956 --> 02:01:54.763]  And most of the lawyers that work in this field are appointed by the court, so both sides are essentially working off the same nickel.
[02:01:55.123 --> 02:01:56.524]  They're both being paid by the state.
[02:01:57.124 --> 02:01:58.645]  So it's not a good thing.
[02:01:58.726 --> 02:02:02.568]  I will not take any money from the state, ever, under any circumstances.
[02:02:02.648 --> 02:02:06.251]  I will only work privately, even if for free, but I will never take their money.
[02:02:09.773 --> 02:02:15.235]  You have helped thousands of families, by the way, and I want to go through some of the basic procedures.
[02:02:15.395 --> 02:02:19.857]  You know, let's say for somebody living in Texas, because the laws are similar, or Mass, or Michigan.
[02:02:20.895 --> 02:02:25.117]  The normal scenario, how it plays out, how you should deal with it.
[02:02:25.478 --> 02:02:27.079]  Again, this isn't perfect advice.
[02:02:27.099 --> 02:02:29.820]  He's not giving you specific advice in your own private life.
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:33.122]  He's just giving you his general experience in what he would do.
[02:02:33.182 --> 02:02:34.182]  Let's be clear about that.
[02:02:34.643 --> 02:02:36.103]  We really appreciate him joining us.
[02:02:36.143 --> 02:02:39.145]  Greg Hessen, MassOutrage.com.
[02:02:39.525 --> 02:02:42.647]  You cannot use words to describe how evil they are.
[02:02:42.807 --> 02:02:44.188]  I have seen a cop choke a woman.
[02:02:46.704 --> 02:02:55.769]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:02:56.029 --> 02:03:07.256]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:03:07.576 --> 02:03:12.619]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[02:03:12.639 --> 02:03:12.799]  I think?
[02:03:31.701 --> 02:03:33.282]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[02:03:33.322 --> 02:03:34.183]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[02:03:34.223 --> 02:03:34.523]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:03:34.583 --> 02:03:35.985]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:03:48.627 --> 02:03:49.067]  It's here!
[02:03:49.308 --> 02:03:54.071]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.431 --> 02:04:02.056]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.768 --> 02:04:09.832]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.212 --> 02:04:21.638]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.958 --> 02:04:25.480]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:27.841]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.181 --> 02:04:32.043]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.481 --> 02:04:52.446]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:04:52.686 --> 02:04:53.927]  We got immediate results.
[02:04:54.247 --> 02:04:58.990]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual when he's disrespectful, defiant, or even abusive?
[02:04:59.270 --> 02:05:00.071]  Do you know how to fix it?
[02:05:00.491 --> 02:05:05.895]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior right now with the Total Transformation.
[02:05:06.175 --> 02:05:09.177]  The program that helps you fix every behavior problem under the sun.
[02:05:09.577 --> 02:05:14.601]  Defiance, back talking, lying, acting out in school, even problems with ADD and ADHD.
[02:05:14.821 --> 02:05:17.583]  There's no screaming, no fighting, no frustration.
[02:05:17.883 --> 02:05:22.827]  The Total Transformation is the program I've used for over 30 years to solve even the worst behavior problems.
[02:05:23.187 --> 02:05:26.910]  Your child will listen to you again and you'll get peace and sanity back into your home.
[02:05:27.230 --> 02:05:27.871]  I guarantee it.
[02:05:28.271 --> 02:05:32.514]  Call now and get how to turn your child's attitude around in one minute or less free with your order.

[02:05:36.457 --> 02:05:37.677]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:06.150 --> 02:06:11.772]  My, uh, particular web guy that's got the clip for some reason isn't into work yet today.
[02:06:11.792 --> 02:06:12.492]  He might be sick.
[02:06:12.552 --> 02:06:14.012]  I was going to have the clip for the show.
[02:06:15.952 --> 02:06:27.595]  Because we don't just have the AP report from a couple years ago where the, in the hearings in Texas, the fact that more than two-thirds of foster children in the state of Texas are on an average of seven psychotropic drugs.
[02:06:29.873 --> 02:06:36.477]  And the chairman of the Texas Psychiatric Association gets to testify and he says, yeah, it's true.
[02:06:37.238 --> 02:06:39.239]  These children have a bad gene pool.
[02:06:39.499 --> 02:06:40.299]  See, it's eugenics.
[02:06:41.980 --> 02:06:46.683]  And he says repeatedly, and they say, well, and he goes to say, by the way, my son is on five.
[02:06:49.065 --> 02:06:50.586]  Now, see, that's also how it works.
[02:06:50.626 --> 02:06:53.627]  They say, don't discipline, don't yell at your child when they go out on the street.
[02:06:53.687 --> 02:06:59.311]  If they won't listen and they're throwing a fit, don't even occasionally, like you would do with a newspaper, discipline the puppy.
[02:06:59.975 --> 02:07:02.136]  Which, by the way, mammals do across the board.
[02:07:03.537 --> 02:07:10.702]  Mother dolphins will actually, you know, if the baby's getting up too close to where a killer whale's at or where sharks will actually nip at them.
[02:07:11.102 --> 02:07:12.063]  I mean, they won't listen.
[02:07:12.643 --> 02:07:16.606]  You do that, they'll take your children, even though there's not a law against spanking anywhere in this country.
[02:07:17.266 --> 02:07:17.647]  Okay?
[02:07:19.728 --> 02:07:24.171]  And it's all definition games that they play.
[02:07:25.425 --> 02:07:29.287]  But understand, they say don't ever discipline your child.
[02:07:29.307 --> 02:07:30.968]  Don't even yell at them, they'll try to take your child.
[02:07:31.428 --> 02:07:33.529]  But then put them on 5 drugs.
[02:07:33.909 --> 02:07:42.834]  And see that psychiatrist, big prominent guy, his son, who he said was under 10 years of age, is on 5 drugs.
[02:07:42.894 --> 02:07:44.595]  Now these are chemically dangerous.
[02:07:45.282 --> 02:07:46.723]  They cause major health problems.
[02:07:46.823 --> 02:07:49.604]  Each drug has hundreds of adverse side effects.
[02:07:49.684 --> 02:07:58.307]  I mean, everything from heart swelling, to brain shrinkage, to retardation of growth, to heart attacks, suicide.
[02:07:58.407 --> 02:07:58.947]  They don't care.
[02:07:59.527 --> 02:08:04.269]  See, they'll abuse their children, because a lot of them believe in this stuff, with five drugs!
[02:08:05.329 --> 02:08:09.471]  And say, over two-thirds need to be on drugs that have been snatched from their parents, because they're upset.
[02:08:09.531 --> 02:08:11.311]  Oh, you're mentally ill, because you don't want to be with your mommy.
[02:08:11.672 --> 02:08:12.732]  I'll just put you on drugs and
[02:08:14.136 --> 02:08:16.398]  I'm going to shut up and go back to our guest, Greg Hessen.
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:19.582]  I'll send you that clip sometime.
[02:08:19.622 --> 02:08:20.543]  We haven't put it on the web yet.
[02:08:20.583 --> 02:08:21.784]  We actually got the video of it.
[02:08:23.426 --> 02:08:24.587]  For some reason, my guy's not here today.
[02:08:25.288 --> 02:08:26.249]  Blue moon that he isn't.
[02:08:27.029 --> 02:08:31.554]  So I don't have that clip, but I wanted to play that today.
[02:08:31.914 --> 02:08:35.218]  Have you run into that type of thing where they just think it's normal to do this?
[02:08:36.121 --> 02:08:48.224]  Yes, I happened to attend a legislative session in Massachusetts, where the commissioner of their social services testified that almost 90% of the children they kidnap, they put on psychotropic drugs.
[02:08:49.104 --> 02:08:50.884]  So that was right out of the horse's mouth.
[02:08:51.945 --> 02:08:55.345]  And I talked with him in the hallway after to confirm it, and he agreed.
[02:08:55.385 --> 02:08:56.166]  Yep, that's what we do.
[02:08:56.526 --> 02:08:57.526]  Start over, start over.
[02:08:58.706 --> 02:09:00.366]  Start over, what percentage did you say?
[02:09:00.867 --> 02:09:01.167]  Almost 90%.
[02:09:04.289 --> 02:09:06.912]  I think it was 88%, to be exact.
[02:09:07.152 --> 02:09:08.153]  I believe that was the number.
[02:09:08.174 --> 02:09:09.235]  Do you have a video of that?
[02:09:09.875 --> 02:09:10.156]  Oh, no.
[02:09:10.216 --> 02:09:17.985]  No, this was just a testimony before a legislative committee where they had convened to make some changes in some of our laws.
[02:09:18.806 --> 02:09:19.867]  And he did testify.
[02:09:19.907 --> 02:09:21.709]  I was in the audience and I heard him say it.
[02:09:23.223 --> 02:09:27.325]  Eighty-eight percent, and then they say, oh, we don't do any scientific testing.
[02:09:27.566 --> 02:09:29.667]  We just say they have bad genes.
[02:09:30.027 --> 02:09:31.808]  I mean, that's just total junk science.
[02:09:32.468 --> 02:09:34.750]  Well, but they can always get a therapist.
[02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:48.698]  What they forget is that when you pry a poor little baby or a child off of a mother's arms at gunpoint, which is how they often do it, you're going to traumatize the child.
[02:09:49.733 --> 02:09:57.376]  So they get this child, who's completely traumatized from being removed from the parent, and of course they can see that the child's traumatized.
[02:09:57.416 --> 02:10:02.918]  And then they rationalize and say, oh, that's proof of abuse.
[02:10:02.978 --> 02:10:11.020]  In fact, I've seen the cases where if it's a two or three year old, they'll deny him food all day until they quote, tell the truth and admit mommy touched them.
[02:10:11.521 --> 02:10:11.741]  Right.
[02:10:11.981 --> 02:10:12.761]  How common is that?
[02:10:13.493 --> 02:10:14.813]  Oh, of course.
[02:10:15.153 --> 02:10:22.475]  They'll just interview and re-interview and re-interview these children until they get the so-called disclosures that they're looking for.
[02:10:23.735 --> 02:10:30.296]  You know, you can get a child to say anything, particularly in the traumatized state where they pried their fingers off their mother at gunpoint.
[02:10:30.376 --> 02:10:33.577]  I mean, what child wouldn't be just completely out of a normal
[02:10:38.331 --> 02:10:39.612]  Thank you for your time.
[02:10:55.991 --> 02:10:59.632]  And I would go to houses, and I would learn what these houses were.
[02:10:59.652 --> 02:11:02.173]  It could be a two-story, half-million-dollar house.
[02:11:02.553 --> 02:11:08.715]  There'd be some pot-bellied, nellying, usually two men walking around.
[02:11:09.175 --> 02:11:12.416]  They might even be waddling around in, like, jogging shorts.
[02:11:13.057 --> 02:11:15.197]  You know, and even at 18, you'd go, man, this is weird.
[02:11:15.497 --> 02:11:20.619]  And there'd be room after room of just mattresses with kids watching television that looked like zombies.
[02:11:20.639 --> 02:11:22.760]  And you'd learn, oh, this is a foster home.
[02:11:22.780 --> 02:11:23.600]  Now, go ahead, sir.
[02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:24.960]  Sure.
[02:11:24.980 --> 02:11:33.644]  Well, you had actually asked me before the break to give sort of a thumbnail sketch of the process of how these people work.
[02:11:33.684 --> 02:11:34.164]  Yeah, let's do that.
[02:11:34.984 --> 02:11:39.466]  There's really two basic strains of this.
[02:11:39.866 --> 02:11:43.788]  Either it's going to be an administrative case, or it's a case that's going to go to court.
[02:11:44.568 --> 02:11:45.929]  And they're handled somewhat differently.
[02:11:47.221 --> 02:11:57.328]  Once a case gets into the system, and that usually happens because somebody makes a call to this so-called hotline, abuse hotline, every state has one, by federal mandate.
[02:11:58.468 --> 02:12:00.510]  This is all driven by federal law.
[02:12:00.930 --> 02:12:11.697]  It's state law, but the feds say, as long as you set up your state law in cooperation with the pattern that we've set out, then we'll give you all the billions of dollars.
[02:12:12.097 --> 02:12:15.179]  So naturally, every state will do it, because they want the boodle.
[02:12:16.207 --> 02:12:18.889]  So, every state basically has one of these hotlines.
[02:12:19.470 --> 02:12:25.194]  And, for instance, in my little tiny state of Massachusetts, there are 72,000 calls to that hotline.
[02:12:25.274 --> 02:12:27.556]  Are you on a Skype line, sir, or an IP?
[02:12:28.297 --> 02:12:28.477]  No.
[02:12:29.718 --> 02:12:31.059]  Yeah, your phone line's really cut now.
[02:12:31.099 --> 02:12:33.301]  We'll reconnect you in the break, but please continue.
[02:12:33.781 --> 02:12:34.041]  Okay.
[02:12:34.381 --> 02:12:34.662]  Sorry.
[02:12:34.902 --> 02:12:37.744]  No, this is the normal landline.
[02:12:37.884 --> 02:12:41.847]  I've never had any trouble with it.
[02:12:42.348 --> 02:12:45.130]  So, once that call goes into the hotline,
[02:12:45.563 --> 02:12:51.465]  Then the Social Services Department decides whether it's an emergency or whether this is something that can just be administrative.
[02:12:52.025 --> 02:12:54.305]  If it's administrative, they'll come out and investigate.
[02:12:54.585 --> 02:12:59.407]  If it's an emergency, they send the SWAT team in and kidnap the children and put them in captivity.
[02:13:00.427 --> 02:13:02.307]  And then eventually take them to court.
[02:13:03.468 --> 02:13:04.828]  If it's an administrative case,
[02:13:05.518 --> 02:13:22.147]  They basically do a long investigation, put in social services that allegedly are supposed to help the family, and eventually the case closes after they spent tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars of government bureaucracy so-called helping the family.
[02:13:22.888 --> 02:13:25.369]  If it goes to court, of course, those are the more toxic ones.
[02:13:25.929 --> 02:13:27.750]  Those are the ones that are very painful.
[02:13:28.771 --> 02:13:34.114]  And they come in with their SWAT team oftentimes, steal the children, sometimes they'll take them off the bus,
[02:13:34.901 --> 02:13:40.083]  So the mother will be waiting at the bus stop, and the child just never gets off the bus.
[02:13:40.103 --> 02:13:43.505]  That's right, we've seen that a lot, and they don't even call the parents either to tell them.
[02:13:44.085 --> 02:13:44.685]  Oh, of course not.
[02:13:44.805 --> 02:13:50.268]  And of course the parents frantically calling the hospitals and the school and everybody, and nobody knows what happened.
[02:13:51.468 --> 02:13:59.712]  So if it goes to court, then they give the parents a hearing, allegedly within 72 hours, the federal law provides.
[02:14:00.723 --> 02:14:02.484]  And they appoint a lawyer for the parents.
[02:14:02.684 --> 02:14:13.332]  Well, this is a lawyer who's never looked at the case file, has no idea, and probably doesn't give a care anyway, so they always, well, not always, but very commonly tell the parents to just waive the hearing.
[02:14:13.772 --> 02:14:24.959]  Well, in doing that, they may not see their children again for a year, because there's almost no way between that hearing and a final trial to get a child back.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:28.882]  So, for many, many parents, it's a disaster.
[02:14:30.519 --> 02:14:33.003]  So that lawyer tells them to waive it?
[02:14:33.563 --> 02:14:39.652]  Of course, yeah, because they don't want to do the homework to stay up all night like you have to if you're going to prepare for a hearing in a couple days.
[02:14:39.672 --> 02:14:42.676]  I mean, it's not an easy thing to do, but you have to do it.
[02:14:43.727 --> 02:15:04.748]  And if a child stays in captivity at that point, then a year, two years go by... And by the way, CPS, you'll get on the phone with them and they'll say, it's alright, just set up another hearing, just waive this one, we've seen that many times, where the CPS even tells you, oh, it's the formality, just waive it, or here, sign this form, and then everything will be okay.
[02:15:05.488 --> 02:15:06.029]  Exactly.
[02:15:08.978 --> 02:15:18.363]  The way that it has to be done is, if any of your listeners ever find themselves in that position, never agree to anything.
[02:15:19.044 --> 02:15:19.984]  That's rule number one.
[02:15:20.365 --> 02:15:24.167]  Number two, and maybe even the most important rule, is shut up.
[02:15:25.467 --> 02:15:35.193]  Because everything you say to these people can and will be used against you in a court of law, and it will show up in a twisted fashion, totally different than you said it,
[02:15:36.102 --> 02:15:38.785]  No matter what you say, they're going to say you said something else.
[02:15:39.767 --> 02:15:42.650]  And so if you say nothing, then you never agree to anything.
[02:15:43.112 --> 02:15:47.216]  Basically, if you know that rule alone, that'll save so many people.
[02:15:47.756 --> 02:15:56.164]  Listen, I told the story of 1999, or was it 98, and there was this family they'd been harassing because they didn't know.
[02:15:56.184 --> 02:15:56.905]  They were poor.
[02:15:56.965 --> 02:15:58.246]  He worked as an auto mechanic.
[02:15:58.266 --> 02:15:59.247]  They lived in a little apartment.
[02:15:59.667 --> 02:16:02.170]  She thought she'd go, well, you know, I'll go get on welfare.
[02:16:02.210 --> 02:16:03.231]  It's advertised on TV.
[02:16:03.511 --> 02:16:08.576]  She was going to have the baby at the city and CPS had already shown up before she had it wanting to interview her.
[02:16:09.176 --> 02:16:15.501]  And then, of course, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, they get hundreds of thousands in adoption for those, and that's a big joke around here.
[02:16:15.521 --> 02:16:18.503]  Or even Raising Arizona.
[02:16:19.204 --> 02:16:21.005]  You know, it's a joke in that movie.
[02:16:21.805 --> 02:16:24.127]  And they're down there, she has the baby, Cesarean.
[02:16:24.908 --> 02:16:27.410]  Beautiful little baby, no criminal record, no background.
[02:16:27.790 --> 02:16:28.731]  GPS is there.
[02:16:29.551 --> 02:16:32.453]  I get down there, we walk in with cameras, they don't know we're coming.
[02:16:32.753 --> 02:16:34.715]  We open the door, and the Austin cop
[02:16:35.453 --> 02:16:38.736]  He literally has his hand on the back of her neck, squeezing her.
[02:16:39.056 --> 02:16:42.999]  By the time the camera comes in behind me, he says, he lets go of her and says, get out of here.
[02:16:43.239 --> 02:16:46.562]  They later tell us he was squeezing her, trying to shine the form.
[02:16:46.882 --> 02:16:50.545]  Have you seen it before where they compel them physically to sign stuff?
[02:16:51.345 --> 02:16:52.606]  No, I hadn't seen that.
[02:16:52.726 --> 02:16:58.771]  But, you know, in our very civilized state of Massachusetts, they just do it legally.
[02:16:59.271 --> 02:17:00.532]  They just simply take the kids.
[02:17:00.833 --> 02:17:01.913]  They bring SWAT teams in.
[02:17:02.174 --> 02:17:05.216]  They bring armed guards and they simply just take children.
[02:17:06.405 --> 02:17:07.266]  And nobody can resist them.
[02:17:08.126 --> 02:17:14.671]  We had a listener who was to do a 9-11 truth protesting and so they came and took his son.
[02:17:14.711 --> 02:17:17.534]  He just got him back because they did fight him.
[02:17:18.074 --> 02:17:20.036]  But they just said, look, we're taking your son.
[02:17:20.596 --> 02:17:21.557]  This is not allowed.
[02:17:21.597 --> 02:17:22.417]  You're mentally ill.
[02:17:22.878 --> 02:17:25.620]  You're not supposed to be protesting 9-11 being an inside job.
[02:17:28.798 --> 02:17:29.859]  So that's the freedom.
[02:17:29.899 --> 02:17:30.499]  Stay there, sir.
[02:17:30.519 --> 02:17:34.802]  We're going to come right back and talk more about how you handle this, what you would personally do.
[02:17:35.403 --> 02:17:37.444]  And then we'll jam in a few phone calls for our guests, too, at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:37.464 --> 02:17:38.605]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:38.625 --> 02:17:39.686]  We're talking to Greg Hessen.
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:50.905]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:51.065 --> 02:17:59.152]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.412 --> 02:18:06.458]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:06.638 --> 02:18:07.899]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:18:07.999 --> 02:18:13.884]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:18:14.084 --> 02:18:19.168]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:18:19.288 --> 02:18:28.156]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:18:28.436 --> 02:18:31.738]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:18:33.660 --> 02:18:34.060]  I think so.
[02:18:45.359 --> 02:18:48.983]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:18:49.283 --> 02:18:52.786]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:48.082]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.983 --> 02:19:51.325]  Why did the first George Bush attack Iraq?
[02:19:51.906 --> 02:19:53.327]  Why did his son go into Iraq?
[02:19:54.483 --> 02:19:56.664]  Are we really fighting a war on terrorism?
[02:19:57.224 --> 02:19:58.344]  We'd like for you to know.

[02:20:05.586 --> 02:20:08.327]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:18.419 --> 02:20:21.261]  Have you been told why the world is more dangerous than ever?
[02:20:21.781 --> 02:20:27.264]  Communist China and Russia are arming, both supply, the military in South American countries.

[02:20:45.202 --> 02:20:49.163]  Do you know the difference between the millions of millionaires in this country and you?
[02:20:49.683 --> 02:20:50.004]  Simple.
[02:20:50.344 --> 02:20:52.324]  They decided they wanted to be millionaires.
[02:20:52.724 --> 02:20:54.145]  So they went out and did it.
[02:20:54.685 --> 02:20:56.526]  So, do you want to be a millionaire?

[02:21:35.209 --> 02:21:36.210]  This is not
[02:22:11.572 --> 02:22:13.193]  There's no doubt they're the bad guys.
[02:22:14.814 --> 02:22:17.937]  In all their propaganda and all their PSAs, can't change that.
[02:22:18.037 --> 02:22:23.041]  I've been to, I don't know, probably 15 times to courts when they're taking people's children.
[02:22:23.181 --> 02:22:25.723]  And I mean, there will be families crying.
[02:22:25.784 --> 02:22:26.684]  They are in terror.
[02:22:26.724 --> 02:22:27.605]  They are in fear.
[02:22:27.685 --> 02:22:28.506]  They just, it is,
[02:22:29.264 --> 02:22:31.445]  It is worse than any Hollywood movie you could see.
[02:22:33.166 --> 02:22:39.049]  And the children are begging and reaching out, and I mean, the guards are laughing, the judge is laughing, the lawyers are laughing.
[02:22:39.669 --> 02:22:43.491]  And I've been in other... I've been... I've gone to watch criminal trials, murder cases, everybody's serious.
[02:22:44.131 --> 02:22:46.112]  It is a sick culture of filth.
[02:22:47.173 --> 02:22:53.236]  I mean, these are people, the lowest scum of the earth, who enjoy raw power.
[02:22:54.356 --> 02:22:56.097]  And they love hurting families.
[02:22:58.849 --> 02:23:01.050]  Greg Hesson, how do you stay out of their clutches?
[02:23:01.230 --> 02:23:04.632]  I mean, my bottom line is it doesn't matter what's going on.
[02:23:04.772 --> 02:23:08.854]  If you get a knock on the door, don't answer it, because that just means it's administrative.
[02:23:08.954 --> 02:23:13.117]  And I personally, if you've got family in another state, nothing's more important than your children.
[02:23:13.337 --> 02:23:17.559]  Before anything has started, before anything, I mean, pick up, leave your house, everything, just leave.
[02:23:17.939 --> 02:23:21.701]  That's just, I think, the most baseline, safest thing.
[02:23:22.282 --> 02:23:22.822]  What do you say?
[02:23:23.402 --> 02:23:23.742]  Oh, yes.
[02:23:24.343 --> 02:23:24.843]  If you have
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:29.582]  Uh, and inkling or get wind of the fact that they may be coming after you.
[02:23:30.282 --> 02:23:31.162]  That is the first thing.
[02:23:31.703 --> 02:23:36.705]  Is, uh, throw everything in your car and drive.
[02:23:36.905 --> 02:23:37.405]  Speed limit.
[02:23:38.905 --> 02:23:39.886]  And get out of town.
[02:23:39.926 --> 02:23:44.048]  You can always, uh, send agents back to get your things.
[02:23:44.288 --> 02:23:45.888]  You can sell your house if you have to.
[02:23:45.968 --> 02:23:47.109]  You can do anything you can.
[02:23:47.965 --> 02:24:14.561]  uh... from afar but you cannot get your children back and very in many many cases so and by the way you naively think this is still america it isn't okay i want everybody to understand that okay it is very true i mean i'll give you an example up in uh... central massachusetts here at eleven thirty am on a friday night seven people armed uh... two were armed came to uh... a woman's home an eighty five-year-old grandmother
[02:24:15.433 --> 02:24:23.938]  And her granddaughter and the great-grandson, age four, and took the four-year-old away at 11.30 on Friday night.
[02:24:25.519 --> 02:24:28.981]  Three days later, the child was back with the mother.
[02:24:29.782 --> 02:24:33.264]  They said, oops, but they made a mistake.
[02:24:34.258 --> 02:24:36.219]  It really turned out there was no abuse.
[02:24:36.499 --> 02:24:44.463]  But can you imagine the terror that one would feel if, at midnight, you end up getting raided by the SWAT team that way?
[02:24:44.503 --> 02:24:50.205]  And that's typically the way they like to do it on a Friday night, where the court is not open, so you can't do anything about it.
[02:24:50.245 --> 02:24:54.027]  You can't go in and make a petition to the court and say, what's going on here?
[02:24:54.527 --> 02:25:02.971]  So the children are then being able to be kept in captivity all weekend, drugged up, and propagandized so that they can make the proper disclosures for a hearing the next week.
[02:25:04.210 --> 02:25:04.730]  And you're right.
[02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:05.851]  It is not America.
[02:25:06.351 --> 02:25:07.671]  There's no due process.
[02:25:11.133 --> 02:25:12.854]  If you get wind of it, you've got to leave.
[02:25:13.194 --> 02:25:21.257]  If you are put in the position, which you must do if it's at all possible, to find a lawyer who understands this stuff and knows how to fight it,
[02:25:21.764 --> 02:25:24.125]  And doesn't just play ball with these people.
[02:25:24.185 --> 02:25:32.630]  Yeah, Google like, like, fight CPS, you know, or lawyer to fight CPS and Google in your area and then check message boards about what people say about him.
[02:25:33.090 --> 02:25:34.091]  Right.
[02:25:34.231 --> 02:25:34.811]  Or her.
[02:25:35.211 --> 02:25:39.153]  And there's human beings that enjoy fighting demons in every major city.
[02:25:39.834 --> 02:25:46.977]  Well, there are some around and I don't know who they are particularly because I'm sort of just caught in my own little corner of the world fighting them here.
[02:25:47.017 --> 02:25:50.139]  But I've, you know, I've talked with lawyers in other states who are quite
[02:25:51.832 --> 02:25:56.014]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:25:56.054 --> 02:26:10.864]  You know, I'm middle class, and my wife has friends that are middle class, upper middle class in many cases, and I hear every few months about a story about the child jumps off monkey bars in front of everyone, breaks their finger, they take them to the clinic and CPS comes and tries to take them or does take them.
[02:26:11.888 --> 02:26:13.229]  You know, I broke bones as a kid.
[02:26:13.269 --> 02:26:14.849]  My mother fell out of a tree and broke her arm.
[02:26:15.210 --> 02:26:18.591]  Now, my dad, you know, is a dentist, oral surgeon.
[02:26:18.611 --> 02:26:22.092]  I mean, this is just 20 years ago when I was a teenager.
[02:26:22.152 --> 02:26:24.893]  I was at the pool wrestling, chicken fighting on shoulders, you know?
[02:26:25.994 --> 02:26:33.617]  And my shoulder got partially dislocated and I got home and it was spasming and hurting and my dad checked me and said, listen son, he got real serious.
[02:26:33.657 --> 02:26:36.438]  He said, I'm going to take you to a hospital where I know people.
[02:26:36.918 --> 02:26:37.218]  I don't want
[02:26:56.997 --> 02:26:59.399]  To give the impression of hyperbole.
[02:26:59.619 --> 02:27:00.960]  This is really how it is.
[02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:07.385]  It's so easy to extrapolate from a few specific cases to the general public.
[02:27:07.866 --> 02:27:10.668]  Because there's three and a half million of these complaints every year.
[02:27:10.688 --> 02:27:12.069]  This is no joke.
[02:27:12.409 --> 02:27:14.411]  It is so pervasive, it's unbelievable.
[02:27:15.530 --> 02:27:24.095]  And folks, they've already just fed on the poor minority people who are basically, most of them have had their kids taken or are in the system.
[02:27:24.735 --> 02:27:27.457]  Now they're going up to million-dollar houses now and doing this.
[02:27:27.477 --> 02:27:28.498]  I mean, nobody's safe.
[02:27:28.518 --> 02:27:32.000]  All right, we'll be right back, final segment with our guest.
[02:27:36.122 --> 02:27:39.124]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.044 --> 02:27:42.726]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.566 --> 02:27:51.376]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself.
[02:27:51.809 --> 02:27:53.530]  So that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[02:27:54.071 --> 02:27:56.453]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[02:27:56.913 --> 02:28:04.659]  Now there's Night Skin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[02:28:05.199 --> 02:28:11.785]  Night Skin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[02:28:12.245 --> 02:28:17.469]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[02:28:18.130 --> 02:28:19.711]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[02:28:20.171 --> 02:28:25.414]  Try NightSkin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed both inside and out.

[02:28:38.642 --> 02:28:38.922]  Call 1-800-894-3418.

[02:28:45.868 --> 02:28:50.132]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:28:50.392 --> 02:28:55.217]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:55.237 --> 02:28:56.818]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:56.998 --> 02:29:00.381]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[02:29:11.852 --> 02:29:12.072]  Yes!
[02:29:12.112 --> 02:29:14.574]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[02:29:21.960 --> 02:29:23.301]  I use them and love them.
[02:29:23.321 --> 02:29:24.902]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:29:25.182 --> 02:29:26.303]  And I say it big time.
[02:29:26.603 --> 02:29:27.824]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[02:29:27.844 --> 02:29:28.084]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[02:29:38.052 --> 02:29:40.757]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[02:29:45.991 --> 02:29:46.411]  Attention!
[02:29:46.511 --> 02:29:49.332]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:29:49.632 --> 02:29:53.934]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:29:54.254 --> 02:29:54.934]  Listen closely.
[02:29:55.574 --> 02:30:03.057]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[02:30:03.337 --> 02:30:12.100]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[02:30:12.720 --> 02:30:12.860]  Yeah.
[02:30:30.196 --> 02:30:30.596]  Federal Agents!
[02:30:30.616 --> 02:30:30.976]  We are armed!
[02:31:01.538 --> 02:31:06.160]  Bottom line!
[02:31:06.200 --> 02:31:12.463]  The whole social worker system started in England for eugenics to carry out CPS sterilization and breakup of families.
[02:31:13.243 --> 02:31:15.244]  The textbooks say the family's a disease.
[02:31:15.304 --> 02:31:17.065]  That's the term they use to be eradicated.
[02:31:17.085 --> 02:31:20.927]  And a lot of these people get bounties for children they take.
[02:31:21.187 --> 02:31:23.208]  And it is an evil culture.
[02:31:23.228 --> 02:31:25.909]  It does much more evil than it does good.
[02:31:26.821 --> 02:31:29.631]  And anytime you violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution, that's going to happen.
[02:31:30.012 --> 02:31:32.380]  I hope everybody will support Greg Heston and check out...
[02:31:33.246 --> 02:31:37.127]  The information and the horror stories and the info at MassOutrage.com.
[02:31:37.547 --> 02:31:39.147]  Somebody's got to stand up for these children.
[02:31:40.187 --> 02:31:45.288]  Greg, despite all CPS's propaganda, and we're going to take a few calls, do you think we're starting to turn the corner?
[02:31:45.328 --> 02:31:59.691]  I mean, I do see a lot of people now who didn't ten years ago know how bad this was, now do seem to know that this is bad news, and people are, I think, starting to realize that this tattletale society is a bad thing as well, or am I off base?
[02:32:00.771 --> 02:32:04.058]  I have not seen any signs that it's abating, only accelerating.
[02:32:05.938 --> 02:32:13.945]  You know, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the articles from which you actually contacted me in the New American Magazine.
[02:32:13.965 --> 02:32:29.096]  A number of those stories are detailed there, and in the whole scheme that we've sort of spoken in generalities is set out in some detail in the New American Magazine article, and I appreciated they publishing that because it took a lot of courage to put this information out there.
[02:32:29.177 --> 02:32:30.878]  Well, put it in a nutshell for those who didn't read it.
[02:32:31.682 --> 02:32:41.990]  Well, you know, basically the whole process is set out in that article about a case going from tip to nuts and how it works and some of their dirty tricks.
[02:32:42.830 --> 02:32:53.478]  Also, in a second article, I give some details about families that have endured their predatory tactics and how they survived them, and in some cases they're still ongoing.
[02:32:54.184 --> 02:33:01.373]  Well, I know they're grabbing more children and expanding, but my point is that just the people are at least waking up now to the threat.
[02:33:02.314 --> 02:33:13.487]  I think more people may know somebody that had it happen to, or that it happened to them themselves, because you can't make that many complaints every year to CPS without a lot of families being impacted.
[02:33:14.851 --> 02:33:22.338]  So many people have had at least an initial investigation or know somebody that has or even went through something more intensive.
[02:33:22.738 --> 02:33:31.866]  So I agree, there's a lot more families that have been impacted, but this is an issue that has no identifiable national or advocacy organization right now.
[02:33:32.206 --> 02:33:39.492]  So many groups do, whether it's guns or elderly or environment or whatever, there is advocacy organizations all over the city.
[02:33:39.772 --> 02:33:42.094]  This is a group of parents
[02:33:43.416 --> 02:33:43.877]  That's right.
[02:34:02.452 --> 02:34:09.965]  Of just a bunch of scum running around having their way with children and ruining families and the horror and the pain just rips my guts out.
[02:34:09.985 --> 02:34:12.188]  Let's jam a call or two in here.
[02:34:12.248 --> 02:34:15.955]  Stephen Colorado, you're on the air with Greg Hessen of MassOutrage.com.
[02:34:16.641 --> 02:34:18.062]  Yeah, hello Alex, hello Greg.
[02:34:18.342 --> 02:34:19.022]  Two questions.
[02:34:19.403 --> 02:34:23.125]  First one, Alex, you mentioned a CIA program that was meant to break up the family.
[02:34:23.185 --> 02:34:24.226]  What was the name of that again?
[02:34:24.446 --> 02:34:28.928]  There were a lot of different programs, but Gloria Steinem brags that she was given CIA funding.
[02:34:29.769 --> 02:34:32.971]  The Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller Foundations admit
[02:34:33.511 --> 02:34:42.194]  I mean, there's hundreds of papers and documents on it that they started in the 20s to control the women's liberation movement, Margaret Sanger, the eugenicist, and it was really to hurt women.
[02:34:42.214 --> 02:34:43.435]  It was really to break up the family.
[02:34:43.695 --> 02:34:56.519]  The Nazis did it, too, and that's mainline history books about breaking up the family and trying to have people, you know, have multiple partners and just get children under control of the state.
[02:34:56.820 --> 02:34:57.880]  You want to comment on that, Greg?
[02:34:59.355 --> 02:35:01.377]  No, I think you've said it very well.
[02:35:01.757 --> 02:35:04.279]  There are a lot of strains behind the scenes.
[02:35:04.800 --> 02:35:13.367]  The feminists, the homosexuals, a huge amount of this is driven by homosexual advocacy because they want a lot of these children and they get a lot of these children.
[02:35:13.407 --> 02:35:16.590]  So it's not just a group, there's a lot of different
[02:35:18.212 --> 02:35:21.495]  Uh, interests that are clamoring for this system to take over.
[02:35:21.515 --> 02:35:22.196]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:35:22.296 --> 02:35:26.919]  And you know, for folks out there that hear that and go, oh, you're gay bashing or whatever, hey, it's a fact.
[02:35:26.959 --> 02:35:31.663]  They're taking a lot of these kids, a lot of these CPS workers are into this, and they're giving them to these families.
[02:35:31.723 --> 02:35:32.644]  It's really sick.
[02:35:33.025 --> 02:35:33.685]  And it's wrong.
[02:35:34.406 --> 02:35:40.631]  In Massachusetts, one state legislator said that 40% of the children they take go to homosexual families.
[02:35:42.313 --> 02:35:44.815]  I don't know if it's true or not, but that's what the legislators said.
[02:35:45.115 --> 02:35:45.736]  Unbelievable.
[02:35:45.756 --> 02:35:46.757]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[02:35:47.497 --> 02:35:48.858]  Dan in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:35:48.898 --> 02:35:49.299]  Go ahead.
[02:35:50.780 --> 02:35:52.281]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:35:52.321 --> 02:35:53.182]  You're a true patriot.
[02:35:53.502 --> 02:35:57.405]  You know, I wanted to tell you a brief story about myself and a girlfriend that I lived with in Myrtle Beach.
[02:35:57.465 --> 02:36:02.750]  She was the manager at a motel on the Ocean Strip, and I helped her a lot taking care of her 10-month-old child.
[02:36:03.170 --> 02:36:05.752]  We lived in an apartment that was, like, behind the office there.
[02:36:06.052 --> 02:36:10.636]  Anyways, this motel was, like, known for drug activity from the locals that actually lived there.
[02:36:11.124 --> 02:36:14.885]  You know, it wasn't a great establishment, but, you know, we had to maintain and live.
[02:36:15.305 --> 02:36:17.745]  Now, just to iterate, you know, me and my girlfriend did not do drugs.
[02:36:17.805 --> 02:36:19.746]  We were totally clean-cut people.
[02:36:19.766 --> 02:36:20.646]  Yeah, you were poor.
[02:36:20.686 --> 02:36:22.106]  You were poor, and that's not a crime.
[02:36:22.146 --> 02:36:22.486]  Go ahead.
[02:36:22.846 --> 02:36:23.427]  Right, thanks.
[02:36:23.767 --> 02:36:34.209]  Well, one night, you know, we had a fight break out between two druggies in the front of the motel there, and her and I both stepped outside for maybe two minutes at most to break up the fight and call the police.
[02:36:34.749 --> 02:36:37.149]  Well, you know, the baby was asleep inside the office.
[02:36:37.649 --> 02:36:40.130]  Long story short, the next day, CPS shows up,
[02:36:41.065 --> 02:36:44.166]  accuses me and her of abandoning the child.
[02:36:45.207 --> 02:36:48.508]  They claim they got a tip that we were doing drugs.
[02:36:48.688 --> 02:36:52.170]  Yeah, that's because the cop showed up and then later came in and saw the baby.
[02:36:52.450 --> 02:36:56.551]  Now understand this, again, this is how it happens all the time in Austin.
[02:36:57.032 --> 02:37:01.333]  You're out in the car, you forget something, you run in for just a second, whatever, CPS comes.
[02:37:01.874 --> 02:37:04.215]  You want to comment on that, Greg?
[02:37:05.755 --> 02:37:07.396]  Yeah, that happens frequently.
[02:37:07.476 --> 02:37:09.357]  You leave the child
[02:37:10.754 --> 02:37:17.260]  You're just out in the yard doing the gardening, you may run into the convenience store to get a loaf of bread, almost anything.
[02:37:17.380 --> 02:37:20.222]  This sort of abandonment thing is a very common means they have.
[02:37:20.402 --> 02:37:23.565]  And the drug situation that you brought up is also something interesting.
[02:37:24.125 --> 02:37:25.807]  Remember, they're drugging the children.
[02:37:26.628 --> 02:37:37.097]  But if a person, not that I advocate it, but if a person smokes marijuana, that'll be a basis for removing children from the home, and yet they'll give these children far more drugs.
[02:37:37.944 --> 02:37:38.164]  Absolutely.
[02:37:38.244 --> 02:37:39.224]  Dan, we're out of time.
[02:37:39.244 --> 02:37:41.265]  What ended up happening with the baby?
[02:37:41.305 --> 02:37:42.205]  Did you let them do that?
[02:38:04.147 --> 02:38:05.908]  Well, yeah, I mean, we had to protect the child.
[02:38:05.948 --> 02:38:08.811]  We, you know, we were... We're looking for dirt on you.
[02:38:09.071 --> 02:38:10.372]  You have a Fifth Amendment.
[02:38:10.612 --> 02:38:11.413]  This is America.
[02:38:11.453 --> 02:38:12.754]  Look, I appreciate your call.
[02:38:13.154 --> 02:38:13.474]  Thank you.
[02:38:14.115 --> 02:38:14.955]  Oh, man.
[02:38:15.055 --> 02:38:16.176]  See how we've been trained?
[02:38:16.216 --> 02:38:17.317]  I'm not mad at you calling.
[02:38:17.337 --> 02:38:18.398]  Well, no, no, but it's hard.
[02:38:18.418 --> 02:38:21.080]  If you have a... If you have cops coming to your door with guns...
[02:38:21.773 --> 02:38:26.534]  You know, face it, it's not easy to stand up to people like that and say, hey, you can't come in.
[02:38:26.754 --> 02:38:28.995]  They're very menacing, and they demand to be let in.
[02:38:29.015 --> 02:38:30.816]  They don't tell you you have a right to say no.
[02:38:31.176 --> 02:38:32.596]  They say, you have to let us in.
[02:38:32.896 --> 02:38:41.939]  Greg, I've got to get you back up for a full two hours to take calls in the near future, because we've got Becky and Max and tons of other people who want to talk to you, but I've got another guest popping on right now.
[02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:44.179]  The website's MassOutrage.com.
[02:38:44.580 --> 02:38:46.280]  MassOutrage.com.
[02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:49.601]  And I really appreciate you, and we should all pray for you in the work.
[02:38:49.981 --> 02:39:03.207]  You're doing, and people should go get the materials on your site and the information you've learned from trial and error and the many past battles, battle hardened in this fight against the eugenicists and their social planning network, their social de-engineering.
[02:39:03.587 --> 02:39:05.328]  So again, sir, we appreciate you coming on.
[02:39:06.548 --> 02:39:06.888]  Thank you.
[02:39:07.489 --> 02:39:08.009]  Thank you.
[02:39:09.069 --> 02:39:12.011]  Again, every week we try to spend some time on this key subject.
[02:39:12.031 --> 02:39:16.453]  I'm going to try to talk to Becky and Max and a few others in the final segments coming up.
[02:39:17.916 --> 02:39:19.237]  Al-Qaeda likely to attack.
[02:39:19.777 --> 02:39:20.137]  U.S.
[02:39:20.237 --> 02:39:20.937]  Intel says.
[02:39:20.977 --> 02:39:22.538]  A new report just out a few minutes ago.
[02:39:22.898 --> 02:39:27.500]  They've got the fear-mongering and fever pitch gearing us up now for another terror attack.
[02:39:28.361 --> 02:39:30.181]  Heaven help this country and this planet.
[02:39:31.022 --> 02:39:33.383]  But I always enjoy having him up once a month.
[02:39:35.223 --> 02:39:36.424]  You know why I like having him up?
[02:39:37.064 --> 02:39:38.825]  Because I use his products every day.
[02:39:38.845 --> 02:39:40.966]  In the office and at home.
[02:39:42.012 --> 02:39:43.694]  And because you save money.
[02:39:43.714 --> 02:39:55.466]  85% off supermarket prices and you cut the oil companies out that make the chemical detergents that burn your skin and eat your clothes and make your hair fall out and aren't good for your lungs and your children's mucous membranes.
[02:39:56.372 --> 02:40:07.315]  And it's Marty from Calvin Pierceau, World War II vet, started the company with his daddy when he got back from World War II in Oakland, California in 1947, and now he runs it with his son.
[02:40:07.335 --> 02:40:09.935]  And Marty, great to have you on, my friend.
[02:40:10.295 --> 02:40:11.255]  Oh, thank you, Alex.
[02:40:11.335 --> 02:40:13.976]  Always a pleasure talking to you and your listeners.
[02:40:14.276 --> 02:40:19.037]  We're sort of celebrating here our 60th year of business.
[02:40:20.257 --> 02:40:22.638]  Actually, 60th year of going down the drain.
[02:40:23.803 --> 02:40:25.444]  That's right, your business is going down the drain.
[02:40:25.464 --> 02:40:28.206]  We've been in hot water for 60 years, and we're still cooking.
[02:40:29.547 --> 02:40:35.471]  Now Marty, tell folks about some of the sample packs you've got, and why your soap is special.
[02:40:36.571 --> 02:40:51.381]  Well, when we started out our business in 1947, my father, he's a genius, a brain, he suggested, hey son, we should go into the soap business, because it's not available anymore.
[02:40:51.903 --> 02:40:53.663]  Only detergents are being made.
[02:40:54.043 --> 02:40:55.884]  And I looked at him and I said, wait a while.
[02:40:56.284 --> 02:41:00.805]  How are we going to compete with Procter and Gamble, Lever Brothers, Colgate?
[02:41:01.305 --> 02:41:06.006]  These are pin dollar companies and we got maybe $500 worth of benefits.
[02:41:06.446 --> 02:41:07.986]  I mean, that's going to be a rough climb.
[02:41:08.026 --> 02:41:12.987]  He says, no, son, let me instill and teach you four words.
[02:41:13.867 --> 02:41:17.528]  And those four words have been the principle of our success.
[02:41:17.992 --> 02:41:22.153]  In manufacturing and marketing pure soaps, real soaps.
[02:41:22.593 --> 02:41:26.194]  And those four words are, be twice as good.
[02:41:27.294 --> 02:41:28.314]  And that's what we are.
[02:41:28.354 --> 02:41:36.956]  We're twice as good as anything that Procter, Liebler, Colgate put out, and the hundreds of other chemical detergent companies.
[02:41:37.357 --> 02:41:38.157]  And we can prove it!
[02:41:38.617 --> 02:41:47.559]  And we prove it every day with our one-month tote bag, which is our sort of our sampler, which will last an average family four to eight weeks.
[02:41:48.146 --> 02:41:50.629]  And that's got everything you need to get started.
[02:41:51.029 --> 02:41:55.333]  It's only $16 plus shipping to your door.
[02:41:55.734 --> 02:41:57.736]  And it'll give you, it's a six pound package.
[02:41:58.377 --> 02:42:03.802]  It'll give you laundry soap and bath soap and hair soap and dish soap just to try.
[02:42:03.822 --> 02:42:08.907]  Hey Marty, I want to find out if it's our phone system or this, because a lot of the phone calls have been sounding weird.
[02:42:09.128 --> 02:42:10.229]  Are you on a cordless phone?
[02:42:11.130 --> 02:42:11.270]  No.
[02:42:12.481 --> 02:42:12.721]  Okay.
[02:42:12.761 --> 02:42:13.562]  I'm on a hard line.
[02:42:13.922 --> 02:42:17.383]  Alright, well just, uh, it was breaking up a little bit there.
[02:42:17.503 --> 02:42:18.444]  Is that coming in too clear?
[02:42:19.184 --> 02:42:23.086]  Well, it's, I'm not sure what's going on, but we can hear what you're saying.
[02:42:23.126 --> 02:42:26.767]  It's just important information and I want people to be able to hear everything you're going through.
[02:42:26.988 --> 02:42:31.410]  Look, bottom line, if you leave zest or something else under your arms, it's going to burn you.
[02:42:31.750 --> 02:42:39.113]  Calvin Pure Soap doesn't do that because it's vegetable and fruit oils, and it's discounted.
[02:42:39.133 --> 02:42:41.034]  You get organic and it's cheaper.
[02:42:41.694 --> 02:43:05.213]  Instead of buying all that toxic waste that they pawn off as detergents, that they call soaps, and you've got shampoos, you've got dish soaps, you've got your laundry soaps, you've got everything people need, it's what I use, and again, you sent us a year's supply of it when you were just a sponsor on the network many years ago, I guess four years ago now, and my wife, after a year it ran out, and she said, I want more of this, where'd you get it?
[02:43:06.087 --> 02:43:10.989]  And I told people on the network, hey get me some more of that, and then I ended up calling you and you became a sponsor of the show.
[02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:19.153]  Folks, I really hope you'll take advantage of this because it just really is a great product, a great product line, and it's American made.
[02:43:22.539 --> 02:43:25.242]  61 year by next year.
[02:43:25.262 --> 02:43:28.385]  I mean, 60 plus years set up in 1947.
[02:43:30.026 --> 02:43:31.468]  You cannot beat this deal.
[02:43:32.028 --> 02:43:37.233]  And I just hope folks call and get a free catalog or get the tote bag or get a year's supply of soap.
[02:43:37.253 --> 02:43:38.474]  Marty, give them that phone number.
[02:43:39.876 --> 02:43:40.837]  Area code 510-638-7091 or
[02:43:46.750 --> 02:43:48.211]  Our 800 number, which is 800-340-7091.
[02:43:48.231 --> 02:43:48.511]  That's 800-340-7091.
[02:43:48.531 --> 02:43:51.632]  I gotta read you this email I just got in.
[02:43:51.692 --> 02:43:52.593]  From Jenny.
[02:43:52.613 --> 02:43:56.895]  Your soap is an answer to prayer for my two-year-old asthmatic.
[02:43:56.975 --> 02:44:00.376]  His allergies to all kinds of soaps have caused him
[02:44:12.904 --> 02:44:18.348]  To have very dry skin that breaks out in little bumps and gets very itchy.
[02:44:18.768 --> 02:44:21.530]  He's even scratched it until it bleeds.
[02:44:22.010 --> 02:44:29.416]  We've been using your bar soap and shampoo on him for the past week and it's amazing that the change that has occurred.
[02:44:29.916 --> 02:44:34.519]  His skin has cleared up and he's not scratching at all, all the time.
[02:44:34.539 --> 02:44:38.021]  His asthma has been only half as bad as usual.
[02:44:38.041 --> 02:44:40.163]  Thank you very, very much.
[02:44:40.703 --> 02:44:41.484]  Thank you again.
[02:44:42.248 --> 02:44:42.728]  I'm Jimmy.
[02:44:43.069 --> 02:44:46.491]  This is the kind of response we get from people all over the country.
[02:44:47.151 --> 02:44:47.911]  Well, it's simple.
[02:44:47.951 --> 02:44:51.554]  Why don't you explain to people what's in your average bar soap or shampoo?
[02:44:52.714 --> 02:44:56.957]  Well, our soaps are made from vegetable oils and coconut oils.
[02:44:57.297 --> 02:45:00.799]  We don't use perfumes, which are a disaster area.
[02:45:01.279 --> 02:45:02.080]  They're harmful.
[02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:02.940]  They hurt.
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:04.481]  They do more harm than good.
[02:45:04.581 --> 02:45:09.064]  Yeah, perfume is a... Perfume is a... And almonds and cherries.
[02:45:10.347 --> 02:45:15.094]  Yeah, perfume is a catch-all phrase for literally hundreds of different ingredients.
[02:45:17.637 --> 02:45:18.338]  That's correct.
[02:45:18.759 --> 02:45:19.800]  And they're all toxic.
[02:45:20.121 --> 02:45:21.062]  They're all harmful.
[02:45:21.383 --> 02:45:23.586]  They all hurt more than anything you could use.
[02:45:24.156 --> 02:45:27.138]  On your skin, on your hair, on your body, anywhere.
[02:45:27.459 --> 02:45:29.220]  We don't use it, we don't believe in it.
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:36.225]  We want our products to be twice as good as anything you've ever bought or purchased anywhere, anytime.
[02:45:36.586 --> 02:45:44.692]  And we're ready to take on and challenge these big billion dollar corporations that put out nothing but poisons and harmful ingredients.
[02:45:45.072 --> 02:45:50.017]  Well, that's why I love your product, and that's why I like turning my listeners on to it, and you're also a supporter of this broadcast.
[02:45:50.037 --> 02:45:50.898]  You just can't beat it.
[02:45:50.938 --> 02:45:54.741]  You save money, it's organic, it's made in America, and it supports this broadcast.
[02:45:54.761 --> 02:45:54.881]  1-800-340-7091.
[02:45:55.182 --> 02:45:56.142]  It's called the Win-Win-Win-Win-Win-Win-Win.
[02:45:56.162 --> 02:45:56.883]  1-800-340-7091, or 5starsoap.com.
[02:45:56.943 --> 02:45:59.325]  Just the number 5, starsoap.com, or go to InfoWars.com.
[02:45:59.365 --> 02:46:00.366]  There's a big, fat banner
[02:46:11.116 --> 02:46:14.818]  On the left hand side of the page, over to 5starsoap.com.
[02:46:14.858 --> 02:46:19.421]  Again, 5starsoap.com or 1-800-340-7091.
[02:46:19.621 --> 02:46:21.342]  And you've worked it out.
[02:46:21.863 --> 02:46:26.386]  How much will you save compared to supermarket prices?
[02:46:26.446 --> 02:46:26.766]  I know it's 85%.
[02:46:27.066 --> 02:46:31.769]  Because the prices are not only low because they're factory direct,
[02:46:32.173 --> 02:46:36.997]  And their products are all triple concentrated, so you don't waste and use too much.
[02:46:37.237 --> 02:46:38.258]  They'll last longer.
[02:46:38.518 --> 02:46:39.459]  They work better.
[02:46:39.799 --> 02:46:40.800]  You can't find anything like it.
[02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:43.502]  I mean, how much money does that come out to, though, for the average household?
[02:46:44.342 --> 02:46:44.622]  Pardon?
[02:46:45.163 --> 02:46:47.505]  How much money does that come out to for the average household?
[02:46:48.325 --> 02:46:53.189]  Oh, about $3 a week for everything.
[02:46:54.470 --> 02:46:57.732]  But I know that in the past you've done, I mean, the amount of savings.
[02:46:58.032 --> 02:46:59.173]  How much the average person... About 85%.
[02:47:00.618 --> 02:47:02.079]  Yeah, but we've done it.
[02:47:02.099 --> 02:47:03.899]  85% savings of what you're buying in the supermarket.
[02:47:03.919 --> 02:47:16.484]  But before we've done the math on it, because if you look at, the average person spends about, what, 18% of their grocery bill on these chemicals, and then that comes out, I think it's, isn't it over $1,000 a year you save?
[02:47:17.044 --> 02:47:27.488]  Yes, and the average consumer is spending right now about $20 a week in round figures for everything they need in their home, for windows and floors and laundry and bath
[02:47:27.941 --> 02:47:29.943]  And showers and dishes, etc.
[02:47:30.223 --> 02:47:32.486]  From $20, we knock it down to $3.25, which basically breaks down to 85%.
[02:47:39.420 --> 02:47:40.761]  That's the mathematics of it.
[02:47:41.141 --> 02:47:52.588]  Well, it's amazing, and folks, it's 1-800-340-7091, or calvinpuresoap.com, or fivescarsoap.com, and you just can't beat the deal.
[02:47:52.608 --> 02:47:57.331]  And plus, I mean, just read what's on detergents, that also, by the way, eat your clothes.
[02:47:57.771 --> 02:48:00.073]  Real soap, your clothes will last longer too, won't they, Marty?
[02:48:00.834 --> 02:48:04.095]  Well, your clothes will last at least four times as long.
[02:48:04.396 --> 02:48:12.179]  You will have hand-me-downs, which you don't have now, like baby clothes and diapers and underwear and socks and towels.
[02:48:12.519 --> 02:48:14.980]  The longevity is virtually guaranteed.
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:18.302]  Marty, we are flat out of time, my friend.
[02:48:18.322 --> 02:48:18.382]  1-800-340-7091.
[02:48:18.822 --> 02:48:19.522]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:48:19.542 --> 02:48:20.563]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:48:25.525 --> 02:48:26.306]  I'm looking forward to it.
[02:48:26.326 --> 02:48:26.887]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:26.967 --> 02:48:27.208]  You bet.
[02:48:27.248 --> 02:48:29.270]  Let me talk to you off-air here in just a moment.
[02:48:29.771 --> 02:48:30.292]  All right, folks.
[02:48:30.352 --> 02:48:31.113]  Final segment.
[02:48:31.133 --> 02:48:35.679]  I'm going to come back, get into this Bin Laden situation and ramp up this edition.
[02:48:36.159 --> 02:48:36.640]  Stay with us.
[02:48:48.988 --> 02:48:49.449]  It's here!
[02:48:49.669 --> 02:48:54.457]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.818 --> 02:49:02.471]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.146 --> 02:49:10.189]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.589 --> 02:49:22.014]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.334 --> 02:49:25.816]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.296 --> 02:49:28.257]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.557 --> 02:49:32.399]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:58.972 --> 02:50:02.454]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria
[02:50:02.734 --> 02:50:06.935]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:07.235 --> 02:50:11.156]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.

[02:50:18.138 --> 02:50:23.619]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[02:50:46.269 --> 02:50:49.373]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.
[02:50:49.553 --> 02:50:52.296]  We are now offering a critically important $10 package.
[02:50:52.476 --> 02:51:05.091]  The package contains 3 DVDs with 10 different programs, our new 658-page book called The Truth About What Really Happened to the Catholic Church After Vatican II, which is the most comprehensive book ever produced on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[02:51:05.712 --> 02:51:06.072]  I think so.
[02:51:27.831 --> 02:51:30.612]  Well, I wish I had more time because I want to go to Becky and Max and others.
[02:51:30.632 --> 02:51:31.413]  I'm going to get to you.
[02:51:57.341 --> 02:51:58.342]  I wish I had more time for this.
[02:51:58.402 --> 02:51:59.824]  Al Qaeda likely to attack U.S.
[02:51:59.904 --> 02:52:00.464]  intel says.
[02:52:00.504 --> 02:52:04.048]  I mean, if this isn't a propaganda push, number two in Al Qaeda's is going to get us.
[02:52:04.588 --> 02:52:05.950]  Nubin Laden tape is out.
[02:52:05.990 --> 02:52:06.610]  He's going to get us.
[02:52:06.971 --> 02:52:07.992]  They feel it in their gut.
[02:52:08.312 --> 02:52:10.194]  Al Qaeda's rebuilt to pre-911 strength.
[02:52:10.494 --> 02:52:11.755]  All the wars didn't keep us safe.
[02:52:12.396 --> 02:52:15.299]  Chertoff, you've not been vigilant enough in giving your rides up.
[02:52:15.319 --> 02:52:16.981]  You're going to be hit by Al Qaeda.
[02:52:17.001 --> 02:52:21.285]  We'll have reports out on this at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com this evening.
[02:52:22.128 --> 02:52:27.612]  The terrorist network Al-Qaeda will likely leverage its contacts and capabilities in Iraq to mount an attack on U.S.
[02:52:27.672 --> 02:52:30.374]  soil, according to a new National Intelligence Estimate.
[02:52:30.834 --> 02:52:32.716]  It's assets in Iraq.
[02:52:34.117 --> 02:52:37.479]  If there's any real Al-Qaeda Sunnis in Iraq, they're under U.S.
[02:52:37.519 --> 02:52:39.661]  control and are publicly attacking Iran.
[02:52:41.162 --> 02:52:45.245]  Then the media claims Iran is attacking our troops via Al-Qaeda.
[02:52:45.765 --> 02:52:46.846]  Ha ha ha!
[02:52:47.406 --> 02:52:48.887]  Iran is Shiite!
[02:52:49.167 --> 02:52:49.988]  The opposite!
[02:52:52.230 --> 02:52:53.351]  But people just believe it.
[02:52:53.391 --> 02:52:56.453]  It says this image from a video made available by the Intel Center 2007.
[02:52:57.234 --> 02:53:03.899]  Now this is five days, four days after they admit this is an old video 2000.
[02:53:04.900 --> 02:53:07.502]  But they keep recycling knowing the public is dumb.
[02:53:07.522 --> 02:53:14.227]  The declassified key findings be released publicly today were obtained in advance by the AP.
[02:53:15.174 --> 02:53:18.215]  They all had a range of dangers from Al-Qaeda to Lebanese Hezbollah.
[02:53:18.656 --> 02:53:19.176]  Phenomenal.
[02:53:19.216 --> 02:53:20.957]  I mean, it just says we're going to be here.
[02:53:20.977 --> 02:53:21.677]  Give up all your rights.
[02:53:22.237 --> 02:53:22.897]  It's all over!
[02:53:22.917 --> 02:53:26.419]  Meanwhile, the real terrorists are out kidnapping everyone's children.
[02:53:27.099 --> 02:53:28.600]  Becky, where are you calling us from today?
[02:53:28.880 --> 02:53:29.380]  Indiana.
[02:53:29.700 --> 02:53:30.061]  Welcome.
[02:53:30.221 --> 02:53:31.121]  Hey, Alex.
[02:53:31.381 --> 02:53:34.843]  I'm a single mom of four boys, who all happen to be blonde-haired, blue-eyed.
[02:53:35.763 --> 02:53:41.486]  Anyways, I got a knock at my door one day, and it was a woman saying that she was with the FC.
[02:53:42.286 --> 02:53:44.687]  And someone called and said I had no windows in my house.
[02:53:45.279 --> 02:53:48.742]  I didn't know the law that I didn't have to let her in my house.
[02:53:49.162 --> 02:53:51.584]  So of course I let her in and showed her that that was untrue.
[02:53:51.624 --> 02:53:52.684]  I had windows in my house.
[02:53:53.365 --> 02:54:02.432]  And after she gets in, she starts interrogating my kids and interrogating me about... By the way, I've heard that no window thing before.
[02:54:02.492 --> 02:54:05.154]  They just say that, be reasonable, show me.
[02:54:05.614 --> 02:54:06.615]  It's just a way to get in.
[02:54:06.635 --> 02:54:07.936]  There's nothing reasonable about it.
[02:54:08.296 --> 02:54:08.616]  Right.
[02:54:08.856 --> 02:54:11.018]  I know this now, but at the time I didn't.
[02:54:11.753 --> 02:54:18.975]  And anyway, she said that my kids had no shoes on, which I didn't know they were supposed to with, you know, being in their house.
[02:54:19.215 --> 02:54:19.535]  Yeah.
[02:54:19.575 --> 02:54:19.896]  Yeah.
[02:54:20.096 --> 02:54:23.557]  And I said, well, you know, I said I didn't know that there was a law on that.
[02:54:23.637 --> 02:54:35.540]  And then she says that because of me, my house being a mess, which it wasn't, I'd have a home, a homemaker come in for 90 days to make pop-in visits.
[02:54:37.001 --> 02:54:40.502]  So I had to endure this for three months of
[02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.390]  That's right.
[02:54:58.235 --> 02:55:00.736]  And you just look, don't answer the door.
[02:55:01.357 --> 02:55:01.777]  Okay?
[02:55:02.117 --> 02:55:05.579]  And you teach your children, do what I say, the government wants to take you.
[02:55:05.899 --> 02:55:08.080]  Your children will stop misbehaving real quick.
[02:55:08.720 --> 02:55:15.744]  You've got to tell your children, folks, the government's bad, you cannot trust the government, and I've told my children that because you can't.
[02:55:16.684 --> 02:55:18.585]  And this is just the way this country works.
[02:55:19.622 --> 02:55:22.864]  My son was so scared, um, my youngest one's still scared over it.
[02:55:23.165 --> 02:55:24.446]  He called it the Wolf Fairy.
[02:55:24.486 --> 02:55:26.267]  He said, Mommy, is the Wolf Fairy gonna come get us?
[02:55:26.287 --> 02:55:27.388]  Well, that's his spirit knew.
[02:55:27.408 --> 02:55:29.309]  He knew it was an actual demon.
[02:55:29.589 --> 02:55:29.770]  Yeah.
[02:55:30.270 --> 02:55:31.111]  His spirit could see.
[02:55:31.151 --> 02:55:32.031]  It was pure hell.
[02:55:32.291 --> 02:55:33.713]  Children can see right through it.
[02:55:33.993 --> 02:55:34.993]  We lose that as adults.
[02:55:35.054 --> 02:55:36.154]  Children can see evil.
[02:55:36.655 --> 02:55:38.616]  Alright, I, the Wolf Fairy, absolutely.
[02:55:38.676 --> 02:55:40.217]  And hell is what's awaiting them.
[02:55:40.738 --> 02:55:41.458]  I appreciate you.
[02:55:41.478 --> 02:55:42.839]  I'm sorry to Max and everybody else.
[02:55:42.879 --> 02:55:44.360]  Just call me back tomorrow with it, Max.
[02:55:45.321 --> 02:55:46.242]  The Wolf Fairy.
[02:55:48.053 --> 02:55:48.813]  Absolutely.
[02:55:49.013 --> 02:55:50.174]  I call them the Pig Demons.
[02:55:50.734 --> 02:55:51.955]  Pig Demon, Wolf Fairy.
[02:55:52.715 --> 02:55:53.675]  Call it what you like.
[02:55:54.196 --> 02:55:55.136]  I guess she was a wolf.
[02:55:55.156 --> 02:55:58.217]  The demons I've seen have been pigs.
[02:55:58.677 --> 02:56:02.399]  Ladies and gentlemen, we will be back tonight, 9 to midnight central here on the network.
[02:56:02.419 --> 02:56:07.561]  We'll be rebroadcasting continually at InfoWars.com.
