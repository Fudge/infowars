[00:00:05.783 --> 00:00:06.423]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.084 --> 00:00:08.124]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:09.965]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.626 --> 00:00:11.426]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.186 --> 00:00:13.127]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:17.449]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.031]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.941 --> 00:00:31.422]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:31.623 --> 00:00:32.143]  Welcome.
[00:00:32.523 --> 00:00:35.206]  It is August 7, 2007.
[00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:42.752]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours as we are each weekday, Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:00:42.772 --> 00:00:43.533]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:43.573 --> 00:00:44.474]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:44.514 --> 00:00:45.855]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:47.596]  Eastern, my friends.
[00:00:47.817 --> 00:00:51.600]  That's, of course, 9 to noon Pacific.
[00:00:52.857 --> 00:01:08.552]  10 to 1 Mountain, thank you for tuning in across the globe, all of the seven continents as well as the ships at sea, and the weather station down at McMurdle in Antarctica, as well as in the Arctic in the north.
[00:01:10.834 --> 00:01:15.178]  Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics,
[00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:30.991]  The head of the Treasury Department in policy, number two of the Treasury Department, editor of the Wall Street Journal, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, will be joining us coming up in 30 minutes to talk about the police state, the New World Order.
[00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:36.534]  He normally visits us once a month, but so much has been happening, he's been visiting us about twice a month.
[00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:38.775]  We appreciate that, he's coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:01:39.176 --> 00:01:42.578]  Then he hadn't been on in about six, seven months, Tex Mars!
[00:01:43.416 --> 00:01:59.485]  We'll be joining us to talk about a whole host of issues in the second hour, and then Michael Rivero with his monthly visit from WhatReallyHappened.com, my good friend and a fellow Genesis Talk Show host, will be popping in as well and joining us in the third hour.
[00:02:00.106 --> 00:02:02.607]  And we will open the phones up for Tex Mars.
[00:02:03.187 --> 00:02:05.529]  We will open the phones up for Mike Rivero.
[00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.332]  In the meantime, I've got about 20 clips I haven't played in the last week.
[00:02:11.372 --> 00:02:12.533]  I keep sending them to John.
[00:02:13.522 --> 00:02:15.563]  Harman up at Genesis in Minnesota.
[00:02:15.623 --> 00:02:16.804]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[00:02:17.364 --> 00:02:20.846]  We haven't been getting to many of them, so during the break I'm going to go back over a bunch of the clips we've got.
[00:02:21.727 --> 00:02:28.791]  I want to play this Penn and Teller, because Penn and Teller are horrible on 9-11, but then they're correct on global warming.
[00:02:30.071 --> 00:02:36.475]  And so I want to illustrate not just global warming and being man-made, being a fraud, and the global carbon tax,
[00:02:37.245 --> 00:02:41.766]  And how they could get people to sign a petition to ban water, which they indeed did do.
[00:02:42.346 --> 00:02:47.728]  I saw a similar petition many years ago, I think it was on Jay Leno, where they got people to sign a petition to ban salt.
[00:02:48.488 --> 00:02:59.331]  Because if you use the scientific name for salt, it sounds like something that'll eat the paint off your house and give you an orange afro, as they say in Spies Like Us.
[00:03:00.151 --> 00:03:01.272]  And they signed right on to it.
[00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:01.912]  In fact, you can
[00:03:03.468 --> 00:03:11.632]  That's why carbon dioxide has a scary sounding name and we're about to have a global tax to stop it when it is literally the prime engine of life.
[00:03:12.092 --> 00:03:17.755]  Plants are the base engine for the other forms of more complex life.
[00:03:18.155 --> 00:03:21.256]  You learn that in sixth grade biology.
[00:03:21.817 --> 00:03:23.657]  Plants are more important than animals.
[00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:27.559]  The planet would go on without animals.
[00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.140]  It would not do too well without plants.
[00:03:30.263 --> 00:03:55.198]  But the two, it's symbiotic, the two are intertwined, but to have to get up here on air and explain, I know most of you know this, most of you are smarter than I am, but to have to continue to explain that carbon dioxide is a wonderful gas, and has been more than ten times heavier and more frequent, it's one of the more rare gases right now, and it's been directly connected to desertification, the deserts, it's been directly connected to a lot of problems in the oceans,
[00:03:55.985 --> 00:04:00.168]  And that the warming periods are just milk and honey.
[00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:14.579]  The big maxim period that they had during the Stone Age, 9,000 to 4,000 years ago, when it was well over 10 degrees hotter, was again a time of milk and honey.
[00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:24.807]  And when actual civilization first developed, going from the hunter-gatherer to the agrarian, and then from there to the city-state, and now here we are, voila.
[00:04:25.822 --> 00:04:28.023]  But I mean, they've also done mammal studies.
[00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:31.746]  They've been doing these for over 70 years with mice, skinny pigs.
[00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:34.047]  They've done it with birds, too.
[00:04:34.728 --> 00:04:35.548]  And guess what?
[00:04:35.608 --> 00:04:40.451]  You live longer and you're healthier in a higher oxygen environment.
[00:04:40.872 --> 00:04:44.874]  And of course, that is directly driven by carbon dioxide levels.
[00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:49.177]  So, I'd like to have 10 times higher carbon dioxide.
[00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:50.498]  I'm going to be quite frank with you.
[00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:56.129]  I like the idea of supercharged air.
[00:04:56.891 --> 00:04:58.474]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.813]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[00:05:07.113 --> 00:05:09.354]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:16.877]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[00:05:17.218 --> 00:05:20.239]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:23.981]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:33.663]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:05:33.923 --> 00:05:37.424]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:05:37.664 --> 00:05:44.746]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:05:45.026 --> 00:05:46.387]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:09.562]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.943 --> 00:06:17.531]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:25.327]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:25.727 --> 00:06:37.153]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.453 --> 00:06:41.135]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.415 --> 00:06:43.356]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:43.676 --> 00:06:47.538]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:00.894 --> 00:07:03.836]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:03.996 --> 00:07:09.179]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.519 --> 00:07:14.842]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.222 --> 00:07:16.343]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.723 --> 00:07:25.588]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:26.028 --> 00:07:27.649]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:32.031]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[00:07:32.071 --> 00:07:36.714]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:41.676]  Keep it natural.

[00:07:46.078 --> 00:07:50.180]  Or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.602]  Try Cal Bend Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:59.584]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[00:08:02.225 --> 00:08:04.406]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.986 --> 00:08:07.727]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.493 --> 00:08:17.416]  They are getting ready to reintroduce a new blanket amnesty pardon bill.
[00:08:19.277 --> 00:08:20.418]  And don't whine.
[00:08:20.438 --> 00:08:22.159]  I mean, this is the enemy of the Republic.
[00:08:22.239 --> 00:08:24.160]  They're sworn to bring down this country.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:24.680]  Publicly.
[00:08:25.921 --> 00:08:28.022]  CFR's sworn to do it thousands of times.
[00:08:28.763 --> 00:08:32.465]  David Rockefeller's sworn to do it and published a best-selling book saying he'll do it.
[00:08:34.626 --> 00:08:37.428]  And the fact that they're coming back means we've got to whoop them one more time.
[00:08:38.442 --> 00:08:40.523]  So, we'll be going over that.
[00:08:41.804 --> 00:08:47.928]  Also, Fox News uncovers Ron Paul's most shocking skeleton in the closet, and we say that sarcastically.
[00:08:48.869 --> 00:08:49.829]  We'll be going over that.
[00:08:49.909 --> 00:08:51.650]  Romney supporters outnumber Paul's.
[00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.231]  You decide.
[00:08:52.651 --> 00:08:54.812]  ABC News, then misrepresenting again.
[00:08:54.853 --> 00:08:55.873]  We have the video to prove it.
[00:08:56.373 --> 00:09:01.777]  We'll be going over, and it's not just about Ron Paul, it's about learning how to see media distortion.
[00:09:03.189 --> 00:09:10.054]  Also, Georgia, and I'm not talking about Georgia Peaches, I mean over in the Eastern Bloc, former Eastern Bloc, says Russia has attacked them.
[00:09:11.015 --> 00:09:12.256]  This is out of BBC.
[00:09:13.777 --> 00:09:15.778]  And just a bunch of other really important news.
[00:09:15.818 --> 00:09:18.020]  But right now, let's play this Penn and Teller piece.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.861]  Because it's extremely accurate.
[00:09:20.482 --> 00:09:23.364]  But then on the other side, notice they use facts here.
[00:09:23.957 --> 00:09:25.358]  And evidence to disprove.
[00:09:25.638 --> 00:09:30.100]  But when they attack 9-11 Truth-Eaters, they just call us idiots and say we should be physically assaulted.
[00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.142]  But see, Penn and Teller have to say some things that are true on their HBO show.
[00:09:34.842 --> 00:09:35.222]  Or is it?
[00:09:36.263 --> 00:09:37.163]  It's one of those channels.
[00:09:37.203 --> 00:09:38.324]  I think I've seen it once or twice.
[00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:39.965]  It's one of those big cable channels.
[00:09:41.345 --> 00:09:43.506]  Is it HBO or is it Showtime?
[00:09:43.526 --> 00:09:44.227]  There you go.
[00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:45.768]  My memory said no, it's not.
[00:09:46.548 --> 00:09:47.809]  It's not HBO.
[00:09:48.049 --> 00:09:48.749]  It's something else.
[00:09:48.789 --> 00:09:49.369]  Yeah, Showtime.
[00:09:52.392 --> 00:10:03.486]  So they have to mix some truth in with their lies, but what they're saying right here is absolutely accurate and I have seen this done on other TV programs and I personally have experienced it myself.
[00:10:04.327 --> 00:10:06.490]  One time when I was about, I guess it's a college trick,
[00:10:07.259 --> 00:10:13.385]  When I was about 10 or 11, my dad said the scientific name for salt and said, you know, do you want to not have that?
[00:10:13.585 --> 00:10:14.866]  You know, not want to eat that?
[00:10:14.886 --> 00:10:16.047]  Does that sound like poison to you?
[00:10:16.067 --> 00:10:17.088]  And I said, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:17.108 --> 00:10:18.810]  And he said, no, that's that's salt.
[00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.632]  So I learned this, I guess, trick a long time ago.
[00:10:21.692 --> 00:10:26.777]  But this is what they're doing with carbon dioxide with the whole man-made global warming fraud.
[00:10:26.817 --> 00:10:27.177]  Here it is.
[00:10:27.938 --> 00:10:33.043]  We sent one of our pals, Chris McGaha, to a rally to collect signatures for a petition.
[00:10:33.815 --> 00:10:38.479]  She's going to ask people to sign a petition banning dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:43.263]  That's dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:10:44.204 --> 00:10:44.484]  Water.
[00:10:44.765 --> 00:10:45.425]  That's right, water.
[00:10:46.066 --> 00:10:48.728]  And she's not going to lie or even stretch the truth.
[00:10:48.808 --> 00:10:49.409]  Not at all.
[00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:57.636]  She's just going to talk about what water is and what it does with the vocabulary and tone of environmental hysteria.
[00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:01.457]  This is a petition for dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:11:01.497 --> 00:11:05.720]  What it is, is it's a chemical that is found now in reservoirs and in lakes.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.442]  Pesticides, different kind of companies are using this.
[00:11:08.803 --> 00:11:11.605]  Styrofoam companies, nuclear companies.
[00:11:12.346 --> 00:11:16.649]  And now when they use it in pesticides, when we're washing our fruit and things like that, it's not coming out.
[00:11:17.069 --> 00:11:21.273]  Which of course means that it ends up in the grocery stores and in our baby's food and stuff like that.
[00:11:21.953 --> 00:11:24.516]  Causes excessive sweating, excessive urination.
[00:11:24.856 --> 00:11:26.078]  Anything to help the environment.
[00:11:26.258 --> 00:11:27.900]  These people signed.
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.763]  We don't know if they fought, but they signed.
[00:11:31.003 --> 00:11:31.984]  There we are.
[00:11:32.144 --> 00:11:33.606]  Can I get you guys to sign a petition?
[00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:34.547]  What for?
[00:11:34.687 --> 00:11:36.970]  For banning dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:38.151]  Oh yeah, I'll sign that.
[00:11:38.211 --> 00:11:38.992]  Thank you very much.
[00:11:39.572 --> 00:11:42.053]  And our petition woman was getting signatures left and right.
[00:11:42.513 --> 00:11:43.594]  Okay, mostly left.
[00:11:43.934 --> 00:11:46.935]  But man, there's a lot of people against that evil water.
[00:11:47.335 --> 00:11:50.676]  It's everywhere and we just really need to ban it.
[00:11:51.076 --> 00:11:55.538]  These passionate, informed people didn't even need to ask what dihydrogen monoxide is.
[00:11:56.238 --> 00:11:57.959]  They didn't even ask.
[00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:01.960]  Is passion supposed to replace common sense?
[00:12:02.801 --> 00:12:06.042]  We understand the desire to join up and do something important.
[00:12:06.202 --> 00:12:08.323]  It's sexy to save the world.
[00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:26.422]  You gotta spend a couple of minutes to find out if you're really saving the world and not just being herded around by some politically motivated a**hole who may not really care that much about the environment but see this as some chance to raise money for whatever they think is a good idea.
[00:12:27.223 --> 00:12:30.645]  No end justifies the means of lying.
[00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:34.286]  Man, there were a lot of people who signed the petition.
[00:12:34.586 --> 00:12:36.426]  And we're not talking a handful of dopes.
[00:12:36.806 --> 00:12:37.987]  We're talking hundreds.
[00:12:38.427 --> 00:12:43.728]  It causes a lot of urination, vomiting.
[00:12:44.709 --> 00:12:52.591]  Even the head organizer of this rally signed the petition eagerly.
[00:12:53.191 --> 00:12:55.472]  And our petition was still getting signatures.
[00:12:56.272 --> 00:13:01.180]  Companies like pesticide companies, styrofoam companies, nuclear companies, all of these people use it.
[00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:05.147]  Are you concerned about water?
[00:13:05.287 --> 00:13:05.748]  I am.
[00:13:05.888 --> 00:13:09.675]  Is water something that should be banned?
[00:13:11.518 --> 00:13:12.359]  What sort of water?
[00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:13.840]  Water.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:14.500]  Should be banned?
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:14.741]  Yeah.
[00:13:15.221 --> 00:13:16.382]  No, I don't think so.
[00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:17.803]  I think we need to drink water.
[00:13:17.863 --> 00:13:21.325]  I don't know what you mean by water should be banned.
[00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:23.787]  It's a petition to ban water.
[00:13:23.887 --> 00:13:26.489]  It's a hydrogen monoxide.
[00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:27.189]  It's water.
[00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:28.010]  H2O.
[00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:28.870]  No, no, no.
[00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:30.091]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:30.191 --> 00:13:30.351]  Okay.
[00:13:35.755 --> 00:13:36.756]  Yeah, we set these folks up.
[00:13:37.096 --> 00:13:42.660]  But it does show that maybe they're not so much environmentalists as they are joiners of anything.
[00:13:45.142 --> 00:13:55.069]  Now, the call to ban and restrict and tax carbon, carbon dioxide, for a global tax is just as ridiculous.
[00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:04.115]  Just as, I mean, it is one of the three gases, the water is two gases, so I guess there's four gases we need.
[00:14:05.214 --> 00:14:11.218]  The two gases that go into water and then carbon dioxide and oxygen.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.022]  We desperately need those four gases.
[00:14:16.082 --> 00:14:19.184]  That is the basic building blocks of life.
[00:14:19.844 --> 00:14:25.768]  And so when they want to restrict carbon dioxide, ladies and gentlemen, they are literally taxing life.
[00:14:25.828 --> 00:14:26.729]  And they brag about this.
[00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:28.270]  They say it's a fraud in their own documents.
[00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:32.613]  And they say they've got to run a scam on us and we can publish them and show them to you and show you where to get them.
[00:14:34.153 --> 00:14:40.139]  You know, the hippie types out there who mean well, you've invested in this and you'll argue with me.
[00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:41.620]  You'll just say, no, no, no.
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:51.610]  Or a lot of you, like Rothschild did, will say, well, regardless, we need to restrict these and we need to cut back on fossil fuel use and we need to get conscious about the environment.
[00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:55.613]  Well, I think fossil fuels are dirty compared to a lot of other energies.
[00:14:55.713 --> 00:14:56.074]  I agree.
[00:15:00.258 --> 00:15:01.719]  We need to worry about the environment.
[00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:09.384]  There are some serious concerns, but setting up a world government with world taxation power does nothing to address those.
[00:15:09.404 --> 00:15:21.391]  In fact, this is negative, and this is bad, because this then causes people not to address serious environmental crises and serious environmental degradation that is going on big time.
[00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:23.712]  And I care about the environment.
[00:15:23.913 --> 00:15:25.514]  I like little twitty birds and lizards, too.
[00:15:25.914 --> 00:15:27.755]  But let me tell you, I care about my family a lot more.
[00:15:28.487 --> 00:15:34.612]  And the stuff going on in the environment, and my little baby's got good livers, but still, it's not good for him.
[00:15:34.652 --> 00:15:41.317]  And I don't like them breathing the coal-fired plants with the dirty coal here in Texas they've got that are full of mercury.
[00:15:41.838 --> 00:15:42.899]  No, I don't appreciate that.
[00:15:43.319 --> 00:15:46.201]  And I've got scientific studies showing the mercury level.
[00:15:46.482 --> 00:15:47.202]  I mean, it's a fact.
[00:15:47.282 --> 00:15:47.843]  It isn't good.
[00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:48.823]  Okay?
[00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:50.285]  I want to restrict that right now.
[00:15:52.026 --> 00:15:54.868]  But the problem is that it'll explode prices.
[00:15:54.948 --> 00:15:57.851]  And the problem is Bill Clinton laid off use
[00:15:58.778 --> 00:16:12.323]  Millions of acres of national and state land in Utah, which in Canada followed suit across the border, of clean burning coal that has, let me give you this number, almost zero.
[00:16:12.383 --> 00:16:17.125]  It's in the parts per billions of mercury instead of the parts per thousands, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:17.565 --> 00:16:23.047]  You see, the New World Order systematically does insane, horrible things.
[00:16:24.498 --> 00:16:25.018]  D.U.
[00:16:25.178 --> 00:16:27.739]  used in four countries in the atmosphere.
[00:16:28.439 --> 00:16:30.280]  Eight times its safe levels in England.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.981]  Four times its safe levels in the U.S.
[00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:32.941]  We're breathing it.
[00:16:33.881 --> 00:16:35.142]  Thousands and thousands.
[00:16:35.162 --> 00:16:35.662]  What the U.S.
[00:16:35.682 --> 00:16:39.423]  government did, what is it, 16,000 above ground nuclear tests?
[00:16:40.103 --> 00:16:43.605]  I was doing research on that number the other day and I was just blown away by it.
[00:16:44.425 --> 00:16:47.026]  Total, it's over 30,000 tests that have been done above ground.
[00:16:48.286 --> 00:16:49.807]  I mean, they'd have knights out in the
[00:16:50.996 --> 00:16:58.582]  You know, deserts of Arizona and New Mexico and out in the South Pacific where they detonate 10, 15, 20 nukes in the atmosphere.
[00:16:58.822 --> 00:17:03.466]  Not even on the ground, above ground, which is in the atmosphere, but up in the higher atmosphere.
[00:17:04.787 --> 00:17:06.008]  Just seeing what it would do.
[00:17:06.028 --> 00:17:08.810]  Oh, let's see what it'll do to the ozone layer.
[00:17:08.850 --> 00:17:12.152]  Let's see what it'll... You know, hey, I don't want them to use DU.
[00:17:12.713 --> 00:17:14.354]  I don't want them burning dirty coal.
[00:17:15.475 --> 00:17:16.496]  I don't like that, man.
[00:17:16.556 --> 00:17:18.797]  I don't want my kids breathing mercury.
[00:17:20.018 --> 00:17:20.779]  And I'm mad about it.
[00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:22.931]  I'm real mad about it.
[00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:24.132]  Mercury is mooey bad.
[00:17:25.492 --> 00:17:40.358]  I don't like the fact that we've all been conditioned and adopted the use of these cheap plastics which are full of dioxins and other poisons and turn our boys into girls and our girls into little hyper females until their breasts literally rot off of them when they're 30 years old because of all the hormones.
[00:17:41.379 --> 00:17:50.042]  Oh yeah, directly, completely linked in hundreds of studies to those massive levels of estrogen in the women which then break down into other hormone combinations
[00:17:52.515 --> 00:17:54.456]  Your boys are running around like girls.
[00:17:54.936 --> 00:17:59.379]  The hormone then activates, the brains are the same basically, so it activates those areas in the brain.
[00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:09.765]  So your boy's a little girl, and your little girl turns into a whore, and her breasts rot off when she's 30 years old.
[00:18:10.325 --> 00:18:13.507]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen, I've had enough of that!
[00:18:14.347 --> 00:18:16.548]  You better absolutely believe it!
[00:18:16.968 --> 00:18:19.630]  I'm concerned about the environment big time!
[00:18:20.385 --> 00:18:32.318]  And instead everybody's running around having rock concerts and having a great time when they're engaged in cross-species genetic engineering and a thousand other nightmares, folks, that are serious threats to the planet's future.
[00:18:33.199 --> 00:18:35.602]  We actually do have the power to really screw this planet up.
[00:18:36.858 --> 00:18:55.031]  It was born out of high-powered solar flares and ionizing radiation and gamma rays and all forms of spectrum, you name it, and in volcanic, tectonic, colossal, festus-type activities.
[00:18:58.373 --> 00:18:59.774]  But at the same time,
[00:19:01.235 --> 00:19:11.157]  There are things being developed and being used that can really hurt humanity and really screw up the species that are on this globe, the millions of species running and skittering about, including us.
[00:19:12.397 --> 00:19:14.397]  And I know that if they're affected, I'm affected.
[00:19:14.437 --> 00:19:15.878]  There isn't any separation here.
[00:19:16.038 --> 00:19:21.799]  So that's why environmentalism is so powerful and the idea of conservation, because it does make sense and it's legitimate.
[00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:30.400]  And they've taken all of these legitimate, well-founded ideas and basic instincts and they have turned it into a fraud.
[00:19:31.707 --> 00:19:37.609]  To the point of, we've got to explain to people that carbon dioxide is a prime driver.
[00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.110]  Absolute prime driver.
[00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.271]  Of the four gases, it is penultimate.
[00:19:45.032 --> 00:19:45.632]  Penultimate.
[00:19:47.893 --> 00:19:48.714]  Will the elite win?
[00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.454]  Will they continue to run their scam successfully?
[00:19:50.474 --> 00:19:51.115]  Or will they fail?
[00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:53.716]  We'll come back and tell you about the new immigration bill.
[00:19:54.336 --> 00:19:55.796]  Open border, end of America bill.
[00:19:55.836 --> 00:19:56.277]  They're back.

[00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:12.664]  Welcome back my friends.
[00:25:14.225 --> 00:25:20.829]  Dick Cheney's former boss, Ted Kennedy, promised
[00:25:21.892 --> 00:25:45.178]  to reintroduce the bill and said we'll be back they've been back for what six seven years see bush has been in office seven years yeah now and uh he introduced it within weeks i mean within uh february 2001 he had fox up here and called for open borders and total amnesty and then when he got a lot of heat said okay it's not amnesty
[00:25:45.845 --> 00:25:47.685]  In his first State of the Union and his second.
[00:25:48.285 --> 00:25:49.626]  And each bill, you could read it.
[00:25:50.046 --> 00:25:51.706]  And then the last one was even worse!
[00:25:52.466 --> 00:25:54.027]  Oh, you don't like a total amnesty?
[00:25:54.267 --> 00:26:10.470]  How about total welfare, total housing loans, total red carpet, more than what citizens would ever get, just absolute incentives, five years, no federal taxes, retroactive, you don't have to pay, convicted felons, you can stay, aggravated felons.
[00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:11.930]  I mean, it even said it!
[00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:15.711]  You couldn't make stuff up this crazy!
[00:26:17.231 --> 00:26:20.211]  Remember, for the first month when they were trying to pass it, it was secret?
[00:26:20.531 --> 00:26:21.892]  Oh, it's a secret bill!
[00:26:23.592 --> 00:26:26.393]  But trust us, it really cracks down on the illegals!
[00:26:27.773 --> 00:26:30.793]  I mean, the government is so corrupt, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:26:31.213 --> 00:26:32.334]  It's so corrupt!
[00:26:32.394 --> 00:26:35.094]  The lies are so out of control!
[00:26:35.474 --> 00:26:39.495]  They said, oh, it's not amnesty, it gets real tough, but you can't see it!
[00:26:41.295 --> 00:26:43.776]  I mean, I laugh because it's insane!
[00:26:43.796 --> 00:26:46.538]  It's just so over the top!
[00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:48.819]  I mean, the level!
[00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:49.700]  I'm speechless!
[00:26:50.881 --> 00:26:52.381]  And then we finally got the bill.
[00:26:53.402 --> 00:26:56.504]  And they're back with it again.
[00:26:56.524 --> 00:26:59.426]  This time they're promising to make it tough.
[00:27:01.247 --> 00:27:06.371]  They may announce in the next one that all citizens will be killed and illegals will be made kings or something.
[00:27:06.611 --> 00:27:10.313]  I'm being sarcastic, but I mean, how could it get even worse?
[00:27:10.393 --> 00:27:11.274]  And I'm sure it will.
[00:27:11.774 --> 00:27:13.235]  Every version has gotten worse.
[00:27:13.255 --> 00:27:15.137]  Their attitude is, well, we'll just make it worse.
[00:27:17.518 --> 00:27:22.582]  And I think that's so that during debate and things, when the family comes out, they can then take a few things out and get what they originally wanted.
[00:27:23.425 --> 00:27:26.369]  This is JBS up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:27:26.809 --> 00:27:28.652]  New immigration bill in the works.
[00:27:28.712 --> 00:27:32.416]  You can find out about Ron Paul's skeleton up on PrisonPlanet.com too.
[00:27:32.436 --> 00:27:35.380]  I'm being sarcastic, but that's what Fox News is saying.
[00:27:36.258 --> 00:27:38.901]  A new immigration bill in the works.
[00:27:39.362 --> 00:27:50.834]  Senator Arlen Specter, Republican Pennsylvania, has announced that he is ready to unveil an immigration bill designed to replace the now doomed Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act.
[00:27:51.295 --> 00:27:53.257]  Follow this link to the original source.
[00:27:53.798 --> 00:27:56.481]  Effort to revive immigration reform.
[00:27:57.173 --> 00:27:59.495]  And then it goes to the mainstream news article about that.
[00:27:59.876 --> 00:28:08.844]  Senator Arlen Specter must have listened to, as a child, the old adage, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.
[00:28:08.864 --> 00:28:15.651]  And I agree with that adage, but try different approaches, I would add, as a caveat or proviso, addendum.
[00:28:18.257 --> 00:28:33.020]  At last, so it would seem, as the Senator has announced his intention to unveil a new piece of legislation that would replace the Immigration Reform Act of 1639, that failed to pass the Senate in June.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:37.601]  By the way, the headline today is, Spy Chief Uses Reforms to Spy.
[00:28:37.941 --> 00:28:44.442]  You know, again, they call bad things reforms, but that word has been changed in our psychological lexicon to a point where people go along with it.
[00:28:45.775 --> 00:28:57.382]  Until Specter's bill is introduced in the Senate, there is little way of knowing how similar it may be to Senator Ted Kennedy's immigration package that would have, among other things, placed millions of illegal immigrants on a path toward citizenship.
[00:28:57.882 --> 00:28:58.382]  What do you mean?
[00:28:58.422 --> 00:29:00.563]  They were legalized for 12 years immediately.
[00:29:01.524 --> 00:29:06.226]  Never had to visit again, never had to, you're just given cards and can be put on Social Security and Welfare.
[00:29:06.627 --> 00:29:07.047]  One visit.
[00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:07.547]  Boom!
[00:29:07.887 --> 00:29:08.308]  One visit.
[00:29:08.528 --> 00:29:08.808]  Bam!
[00:29:10.561 --> 00:29:23.589]  Among other things, placed millions of illegal immigrants on a path toward citizenship, implemented an enhanced guest worker program, this is the mainstream news, and increased the number of annual H-1B visa applicants.
[00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.832]  We'll be right back, and we've got Dr. Paul Greg Roberts coming up.
[00:29:31.973 --> 00:29:36.296]  And then we've got Tex Mars in the second hour, Mike Rivero in the third.
[00:29:37.296 --> 00:29:50.665]  The websites are JonesReport.com, Infowars.net, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, MartialLaw911.info, and ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:29:50.705 --> 00:29:51.126]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.886 --> 00:29:54.908]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.809 --> 00:29:58.491]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.641 --> 00:30:10.124]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[00:30:10.385 --> 00:30:16.567]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[00:30:16.867 --> 00:30:24.549]  The fact is the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[00:30:24.809 --> 00:30:35.051]  So why not give your liver the help it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors in over 76 countries.

[00:31:01.573 --> 00:31:06.515]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:31:06.835 --> 00:31:08.715]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:31:08.916 --> 00:31:11.957]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:12.137 --> 00:31:15.278]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:15.578 --> 00:31:17.438]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[00:31:17.699 --> 00:31:21.400]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.341]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:31:24.361 --> 00:31:27.622]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy.
[00:31:27.722 --> 00:31:28.062]  I think so.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:49.243]  Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more!

[00:31:53.207 --> 00:31:53.807]  And ask for Packet B.
[00:32:01.559 --> 00:32:04.261]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[00:32:54.571 --> 00:32:55.232]  Do it today!
[00:33:04.955 --> 00:33:05.436]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:07.478]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.959 --> 00:33:10.722]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.862 --> 00:33:15.247]  Ladies and gentlemen, the new Terror Storm is available.
[00:33:24.518 --> 00:33:26.219]  17 minutes of added documentation.
[00:33:26.239 --> 00:33:28.181]  The 9-11 was a complete inside job.
[00:33:28.201 --> 00:33:30.062]  The 7-7 was an inside job.
[00:33:30.083 --> 00:33:42.253]  We caught the BBC reporting 25 minutes before 7 fell that it had fallen in its own footprint due to fires and CNN was also scripting saying the same thing, showing pre-scripting and FEMA admitting they were feeding them that information.
[00:33:42.533 --> 00:33:49.419]  That's just 3 or 4 minutes of the 17 minutes added to the now over 2 hour film with over an hour of extras.
[00:33:49.479 --> 00:33:51.381]  It's about 3 hours and 20 plus minutes total
[00:33:51.801 --> 00:33:55.322]  On one DVD, Terror Storm Special Edition.
[00:33:55.362 --> 00:33:56.343]  The one year anniversary.
[00:33:56.383 --> 00:33:57.303]  I released it a year ago.
[00:33:57.623 --> 00:33:58.704]  This is the second version.
[00:33:58.784 --> 00:33:59.784]  Final version as well.
[00:34:00.064 --> 00:34:00.965]  Call it Final Cut.
[00:34:00.985 --> 00:34:01.805]  Call it Final Version.
[00:34:01.845 --> 00:34:02.705]  Call it Special Edition.
[00:34:03.045 --> 00:34:05.046]  It's just really souped up and beefed up.
[00:34:05.606 --> 00:34:07.427]  And the most powerful film I've ever made.
[00:34:07.847 --> 00:34:09.328]  So Terror Storm Special Edition.
[00:34:09.708 --> 00:34:13.389]  Now available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:14.069]  He's a very busy man.
[00:34:19.034 --> 00:34:21.635]  I always appreciate him coming on the show with us.
[00:34:21.955 --> 00:34:24.276]  Now every few weeks, once a month, so much is happening.
[00:34:25.517 --> 00:34:26.898]  He just basically does it all for free.
[00:34:26.958 --> 00:34:28.678]  I always say, haven't you written a book?
[00:34:28.718 --> 00:34:29.099]  Can't you?
[00:34:29.419 --> 00:34:30.659]  I want to support what you're doing.
[00:34:30.679 --> 00:34:33.220]  No, no, no, no.
[00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.341]  He just puts it out there.
[00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:39.023]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is an economist, a National Syndicate of Columnists for Creator Syndicate.
[00:34:39.424 --> 00:34:45.467]  He serves as an Assistant Secretary of Treasury in the Reagan Administration, earning fame as the father of Reaganomics.
[00:34:45.787 --> 00:34:51.570]  He is a former editor and a columnist for the Wall Street Journal and Businessweek and Scripps Howard News Service.
[00:34:51.590 --> 00:34:55.032]  He is a graduate of Georgia Institute of Technology and he holds a Ph.D.
[00:34:55.292 --> 00:35:03.417]  from the University of Virginia and he was a postgraduate at the University of California, Berkeley and Oxford University where he was a member of the Merton College.
[00:35:04.037 --> 00:35:08.001]  And it just goes on and on, ladies and gentlemen, of all the things he's done.
[00:35:08.021 --> 00:35:10.543]  And we always really enjoy having him on.
[00:35:10.583 --> 00:35:19.230]  Just type Paul Craig Roberts or Dr. Paul Craig Roberts into Google and literally, I don't know, hundreds and hundreds of articles he's written just in the last year or a couple years.
[00:35:19.891 --> 00:35:23.354]  And he's saying this is time to make it or break it.
[00:35:23.374 --> 00:35:25.135]  They're clearly gearing up for martial law.
[00:35:26.216 --> 00:35:30.460]  And there's so much happening in martial law that I can never keep track of it all.
[00:35:31.652 --> 00:35:40.216]  And he also was talking about the economy and the inflation tax and the decision that's been made to destroy the dollar and what we're facing inflation-wise and in the economy.
[00:35:40.236 --> 00:35:42.137]  And he is a top economist, so we're honored to have him.
[00:35:43.078 --> 00:35:44.579]  And a lot of people said, well, Reaganomics didn't work.
[00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:46.520]  Well, it wasn't implemented like he said it should be.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:55.224]  So that you can't, you know, he's actually a, you know, the Von Mises and many other top economists, you know, really tipped their hats a lot of his ideas.
[00:35:55.896 --> 00:36:10.661]  The point is that he is a true paleoconservative, and we appreciate him coming on, but I brought up the point that Deacon Seaney last week, and then two other congressmen, and now another, on the Homeland Security Board,
[00:36:11.711 --> 00:36:17.953]  In Congress, Homeland Security Committee said we'd like to see in the House the continuity of government PDD 51.
[00:36:18.073 --> 00:36:22.414]  I mean 51's there saying for any emergency, economic, anywhere in the world doesn't matter.
[00:36:22.694 --> 00:36:26.235]  Bush is above the Congress now and grants himself Caesar-like powers.
[00:36:26.255 --> 00:36:26.835]  I mean it says it.
[00:36:27.015 --> 00:36:27.895]  PDD 51.
[00:36:28.816 --> 00:36:32.136]  But now he's told the committee you're not allowed to see this.
[00:36:32.717 --> 00:36:34.257]  You're not allowed to even look at this.
[00:36:35.095 --> 00:36:39.179]  And I just sprung this on Dr. Roberts, and he brings up a lot I'm not aware of.
[00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:40.080]  He wasn't aware of this yet.
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:44.764]  I know he's Googling it right now, but Dr. Roberts, what do you think of this new development?
[00:36:45.885 --> 00:36:49.369]  Well, Alex, like I told you, I don't know anything about it.
[00:36:49.429 --> 00:36:50.990]  I'm not up on it.
[00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:54.414]  Let me first correct you on two things.
[00:36:54.594 --> 00:37:00.059]  One, I have never, ever acknowledged that Reaganomics didn't work.
[00:37:00.709 --> 00:37:01.769]  It worked perfectly.
[00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:04.771]  It did exactly what we said it would do.
[00:37:05.391 --> 00:37:08.112]  It got rid of stagflation.
[00:37:08.892 --> 00:37:17.075]  We no longer had to accept rising, ever higher rates of inflation in order
[00:37:18.157 --> 00:37:20.017]  Well, it wouldn't really.
[00:37:20.057 --> 00:37:21.518]  Our program would have worked.
[00:37:44.994 --> 00:37:53.959]  Regardless of the spending, because we changed the policy mix that was causing stagflation.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.102]  Alex, let me finish, dammit.
[00:37:58.602 --> 00:38:05.446]  The spending was causing deficits, but deficits were not the cause of the stagflation.
[00:38:05.486 --> 00:38:13.270]  So, I agree with you that the government prefers to spend and that there's never been as much
[00:38:14.045 --> 00:38:20.711]  Progress in controlling the deficits as the success we had in getting rid of stagflation.
[00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:23.593]  You've not heard of that since we cured it.
[00:38:23.633 --> 00:38:29.058]  You've not heard of worsening trade-offs between employment and inflation.
[00:38:29.138 --> 00:38:31.740]  So it worked.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:32.621]  It did exactly.
[00:38:33.282 --> 00:38:34.503]  I agree with you.
[00:38:34.543 --> 00:38:40.668]  There's a tremendous amount of disinformation about Reaganomics because
[00:38:42.077 --> 00:38:43.538]  Democrats were fighting it.
[00:38:43.558 --> 00:38:45.159]  The left wing was fighting it.
[00:38:45.719 --> 00:38:50.461]  All kind of people who couldn't be bothered to take the time to understand it was fighting it.
[00:38:52.081 --> 00:38:55.443]  But nevertheless, it did work.
[00:38:55.743 --> 00:39:00.525]  And you have to keep in mind that Reagan, how many presidents back was that?
[00:39:00.625 --> 00:39:03.726]  George Bush, George W. Bush, two terms.
[00:39:03.846 --> 00:39:05.847]  Clinton, two terms.
[00:39:05.907 --> 00:39:09.528]  George Herbert Walker Bush, five terms back.
[00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:19.066]  You know, there's nothing that they could do today that they can blame on Reaganomics.
[00:39:19.427 --> 00:39:21.669]  We haven't controlled the policy since.
[00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:43.829]  Well, I'm sorry for repeatedly interrupting you, and I'm actually proud of myself for getting you to blow up on me on air, but I wanted to make sure that the question or my statement was clear, because I mean, I agree with your policies from my layman's view, and I'm saying that it looked like later, though, that they actually got off of that and changed it, and then it was misrepresented.
[00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:44.369]  That's what I meant.
[00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:47.871]  Well, there are all kinds of people who
[00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:52.031]  I certainly agree with you on that.
[00:39:52.071 --> 00:40:04.775]  The other thing I wanted to correct you on, and I'm not a bully trying to beat you up, is this stuff about martial law.
[00:40:05.315 --> 00:40:15.539]  Actually, it seems to me that if they go along the road that they're indicating, it's quite different and worse than martial law.
[00:40:17.168 --> 00:40:46.450]  Would be something under the existing, under the older system, prior to all these new presidential directives, and martial law would have been something subject to constitutional checks, congressional checks, court checks, and would be less draconian than what could happen under the new presidential
[00:40:47.519 --> 00:40:48.620]  Uh, directives.
[00:40:48.820 --> 00:41:10.638]  For example, under the old National Emergency Act, which appears to be superseded by some of the new presidential directives, if the President declared a national emergency and Congress thought that the situation didn't justify it, they could overturn it.
[00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:12.900]  But under the new
[00:41:14.019 --> 00:41:14.420]  Exactly.
[00:41:29.324 --> 00:41:38.809]  People accuse me of over-estimating and over-shedding, but actually, in hindsight, when I analyze old shows or old articles, it's always, always, almost always, worse than what I said.
[00:41:39.249 --> 00:41:43.192]  And I'm looking at this in the old model of a martial law, but you're right.
[00:41:43.532 --> 00:41:44.112]  You're right!
[00:41:44.212 --> 00:41:45.433]  This is even worse!
[00:41:45.493 --> 00:41:50.295]  This is God-Emperor, or what would you say is absolute dictatorship?
[00:41:50.315 --> 00:41:50.936]  What would you call it?
[00:41:52.457 --> 00:41:58.680]  Well, the closest thing to it that we know of, I guess, is dictatorship.
[00:41:59.974 --> 00:42:04.618]  I suppose what you'd call it is unaccountability.
[00:42:04.658 --> 00:42:18.927]  There's no way under the new system to hold the President accountable or to challenge his decisions.
[00:42:19.027 --> 00:42:26.893]  So in that sense, we've never experienced anything like these new directives or orders
[00:42:27.902 --> 00:42:30.264]  And clearly, they're not constitutional.
[00:42:30.284 --> 00:42:40.733]  There's nothing in the Constitution that says the President can, you know, deep-six the Constitution based on his own statement.
[00:42:41.854 --> 00:42:55.386]  So, it may be it's such a draconian move that it just couldn't happen, that people just wouldn't accept it and he might declare it and nobody may pay
[00:42:56.388 --> 00:42:57.109]  Any attention.
[00:42:57.129 --> 00:43:20.286]  He would have to have, whoever used this, would have to have very definite and well-organized supporters to intimidate everyone else, including sections of the military, and silence the courts.
[00:43:21.327 --> 00:43:23.229]  And I just don't think
[00:43:24.862 --> 00:43:28.463]  The neoconservatives are that big of a movement.
[00:43:29.163 --> 00:43:32.104]  Barring a hydrogen weapon or something going off?
[00:43:35.005 --> 00:43:45.187]  Well, that would of course be a good excuse for them to declare this type of thing.
[00:43:46.827 --> 00:43:55.454]  Well, from your study, being inside government and outside as a journalist, looking at it as an editor, they're not making these declarative statements.
[00:43:56.375 --> 00:43:58.337]  Here's how it rolls downhill.
[00:43:58.357 --> 00:44:06.324]  They had former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Myers in front of the committee a few days ago, or late last week, talking about the cover-up of the Pat Tillman killing.
[00:44:07.104 --> 00:44:08.986]  Well, you won't get any opposition from me on that.
[00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.790]  On that statement.
[00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:34.991]  So why are they still?
[00:44:35.111 --> 00:44:35.671]  Why are they?
[00:44:35.691 --> 00:44:36.772]  It's not crazy and crazy.
[00:44:36.832 --> 00:44:38.633]  It's more dangerous and more dangerous.
[00:44:38.893 --> 00:44:45.156]  Now, of course, when Meyers says something like that, I mean, he doesn't know, but what is he going to say when they ask him a question he doesn't have an answer?
[00:44:45.196 --> 00:44:48.298]  He has to say something that gets him off the spot.
[00:44:48.358 --> 00:44:59.103]  So it doesn't mean, like you said, it doesn't mean that he actually has that right or it doesn't mean he even knows.
[00:45:00.135 --> 00:45:27.914]  The reason he did it, of course, was it was already fixed, and the only way he could do anything about it would have been to have gone public at the time, in which case he would have had to resign, or he would have caused a mess, and probably for no real good, because he wouldn't very long have access to the airwaves, but the President and Cheney would.
[00:45:28.675 --> 00:45:37.877]  And so they would control the explanation and somebody would say, oh, well, he had heat stroke or, you know, he was suffering a heart attack or you don't know what they'd tell you.
[00:45:38.557 --> 00:45:47.019]  So he knows that his voice, even as a top general, isn't that big.
[00:45:47.059 --> 00:45:48.499]  It doesn't carry that far.
[00:45:48.519 --> 00:45:49.859]  It doesn't have access.
[00:45:49.959 --> 00:45:52.960]  It's not... Well, let me ask you this question before we get into economics.
[00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.920]  Talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts here today.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.621]  Always honored to have him with us.
[00:45:56.661 --> 00:45:57.721]  Also syndicated columnist.
[00:45:59.904 --> 00:46:13.432]  I mean, I agree with you, this is a big step for the military, the police, everybody to go along with, but the general public still doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground, or even the basic building blocks of our system of government or a society, and I don't think they're gearing up for all of this for nothing.
[00:46:15.233 --> 00:46:18.355]  So, I mean, how would this play out?
[00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:25.659]  I mean, for those in higher up positions who aren't ignorant of the system, who do see all this happening, I mean, do you talk to any of them anymore?
[00:46:25.799 --> 00:46:27.420]  Or, I mean, what do you think they're saying?
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.961]  What do you think the discussions are right now?
[00:46:31.425 --> 00:46:50.533]  Well, you know, a lot of people have left the government, both professionals from the intelligence agencies, officers from the military, and they're quite concerned by these developments.
[00:46:50.593 --> 00:47:00.918]  They see the destruction of the professional cadres and their replacement with brown shirts or political hacks or
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:08.142]  That ignorant people bet on maximizing the power of the regime.
[00:47:08.822 --> 00:47:09.882]  So they're quite concerned.
[00:47:09.922 --> 00:47:26.027]  And I agree with you that there's really no reason for these extraordinary presidential directives and executive orders to be issued if they did not intend to use them.
[00:47:26.047 --> 00:47:31.049]  And so, I mean, we already had a National Emergency Act.
[00:47:32.136 --> 00:47:38.499]  That lets us meet any possible contingency, but still has checks and balances.
[00:47:39.160 --> 00:47:45.743]  And what we're seeing is the removal of all the checks and balances everywhere in the system.
[00:47:45.783 --> 00:47:49.545]  Contingency, catastrophe, or not.
[00:47:50.926 --> 00:48:01.111]  And people who are hell-bent on removing the checks and balances are obviously hell-bent on getting absolute power.
[00:48:02.159 --> 00:48:06.762]  And so I think a lot of people have noticed that and are concerned about it.
[00:48:07.462 --> 00:48:09.524]  And you can say, well, why don't we hear their voices?
[00:48:09.584 --> 00:48:11.825]  And you know that as well as I do.
[00:48:11.845 --> 00:48:14.887]  The media is concentrated.
[00:48:14.967 --> 00:48:16.508]  It's owned by a few corporations.
[00:48:17.448 --> 00:48:19.090]  They can't go against the government.
[00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:23.812]  Why have the big global corporations decided to let the neocons do this?
[00:48:23.872 --> 00:48:25.353]  I mean, they're clearly letting them do it.
[00:48:26.414 --> 00:48:27.695]  Well, they may not know.
[00:48:27.715 --> 00:48:29.376]  Are you talking about the media?
[00:48:29.776 --> 00:48:30.396]  The media, yes.
[00:48:32.351 --> 00:48:38.214]  If you're a big, the big media companies today are so highly concentrated, what is their value?
[00:48:38.694 --> 00:48:40.094]  It's their broadcast licenses.
[00:48:40.755 --> 00:48:43.896]  And those are given to them, free, by the federal government.
[00:48:43.916 --> 00:48:55.100]  So, any of these huge firms that start going on about the government, their broadcast licenses are injected.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.061]  The entire value of the firm.
[00:48:57.161 --> 00:49:01.583]  Also, they will find tremendous pressure put on them
[00:49:02.628 --> 00:49:16.196]  From the Republican Party, the White House, from AIPAC, the American-Israeli Public Affairs Committee, to have people withdraw sponsorship and advertisements, and they would find their advertising revenues collapsing.
[00:49:17.157 --> 00:49:20.959]  So, they don't want to commit suicide, financial suicide.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:31.285]  You could say if all five of them could get together and decide that they would all expose it at the same time, they could break the system.
[00:49:32.048 --> 00:49:32.989]  But that hadn't happened.
[00:49:33.029 --> 00:49:35.352]  They may not perceive the threat.
[00:49:35.512 --> 00:49:45.924]  Alright, let me get in one more question and then we're going to come back in a final segment and talk about what's happening in the economy briefly with you and I meant to get you on about that but this Marshall, well as you said not Marshall Law, this dictatorship development is so serious.
[00:49:47.629 --> 00:50:00.918]  Congress though, I mean obviously they're corrupt and ball off of the same people, but to have the President just say, you're not involved in continuity of government anymore, I give myself powers, I mean that's on its face Caesar Augustus type, crossing the Rubicon behavior.
[00:50:02.319 --> 00:50:05.401]  I mean I would expect, and then Congress did ask to see it and Bush says no.
[00:50:05.941 --> 00:50:10.264]  I mean that is just, what do you think they're really talking about on Capitol Hill right now?
[00:50:12.606 --> 00:50:17.209]  I don't know, the Congress has been amazingly compliant with
[00:50:18.141 --> 00:50:24.544]  The overreaching by the President and I can offer two explanations for that.
[00:50:24.624 --> 00:50:26.105]  I don't know if they're correct.
[00:50:26.265 --> 00:50:34.629]  One is they expect him to be gone shortly and that his departure is better than a big fight.
[00:50:34.969 --> 00:50:36.230]  This is at hand.
[00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:40.412]  And the other is that everyone is still intimidated by 9-11.
[00:50:40.492 --> 00:50:41.373]  We were attacked.
[00:50:41.413 --> 00:50:42.153]  We were attacked.
[00:50:42.233 --> 00:50:44.254]  Bush has got the war on terror.
[00:50:44.294 --> 00:50:45.635]  We have to support the war on terror.
[00:50:46.613 --> 00:50:49.598]  Those two things may be what's in their head.
[00:50:49.678 --> 00:50:51.902]  I think they're making a mistake on both counts.
[00:50:52.583 --> 00:50:53.404]  Stay there.
[00:50:53.444 --> 00:50:53.765]  Stay there.
[00:50:53.785 --> 00:50:54.346]  We've got to break.
[00:50:54.386 --> 00:50:56.689]  Dr. Paul Craig Robertson, the kid of columnists, is our guest.
[00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.411]  Stay with us.
[00:51:04.827 --> 00:51:10.257]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.658 --> 00:51:18.251]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.982 --> 00:51:26.026]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.426 --> 00:51:37.872]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.172 --> 00:51:41.634]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.135 --> 00:51:44.076]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.396 --> 00:51:48.238]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.408 --> 00:52:04.410]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:09.654]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.914 --> 00:52:14.277]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.557 --> 00:52:23.483]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.683 --> 00:52:27.306]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.586 --> 00:52:32.636]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.917 --> 00:52:39.630]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:40.123 --> 00:52:40.784]  What about you?
[00:52:41.424 --> 00:52:46.789]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:07.166 --> 00:53:11.390]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:18.676]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:53:19.116 --> 00:53:25.819]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:53:26.139 --> 00:53:27.740]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:31.242]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:53:31.502 --> 00:53:33.963]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:53:34.263 --> 00:53:41.046]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:53.991]  Former editor over at the Wall Street Journal, father of Reaganomics, joining us.
[00:53:54.051 --> 00:53:56.292]  And these are the times that try men's souls.
[00:54:17.054 --> 00:54:31.203]  You were saying, and we're going to give you five minutes in the next hour to see if you can finish up on the economy, but I want you to be able to finish that thought just briefly, though, because of time constraints, Dr. Roberts, about you believe it's a mistake that Congress is trying to just coast out.
[00:54:31.703 --> 00:54:33.804]  I mean, I think it's a little part of a larger operation.
[00:54:33.824 --> 00:54:42.830]  I think Hillary's going to get all these new powers or whoever else gets in there, some nightmare Democrat, and then we're going to really just continue this dissent, but why do you think it's a mistake?
[00:54:47.091 --> 00:54:55.996]  I think, well, part of the reason could be, if you're right, that somebody will get the powers, whether Bush uses them or not, eventually somebody will use them.
[00:54:57.036 --> 00:54:59.337]  And so that's enough to make a mistake.
[00:54:59.377 --> 00:55:15.226]  But the reason I think it's a more immediate mistake is, it's not clear to me that the Democrats' assumption that Bush is going to step down and let them have an election, I don't, I wouldn't
[00:55:16.015 --> 00:55:44.236]  I would say that that's a hundred percent probability because all he has to do is have a national emergency or catastrophic emergency and he can suspend the election and there are many ways he can have that and of course Cheney and the neocons are determined to attack Iran and the process of attacking Iran depending on Iran's response could very easily produce a national emergency
[00:55:45.137 --> 00:55:49.563]  So we could very easily find that there's not an election.
[00:55:49.863 --> 00:55:53.788]  And if you and others are right, I mean there's no debating that Apex, one of the top three
[00:55:54.925 --> 00:55:57.506]  You know, it was years ago that Admiral Tom Morrow
[00:56:23.985 --> 00:56:27.546]  The Chief of Naval Operations and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff?
[00:56:27.606 --> 00:56:27.886]  Yes.
[00:56:28.286 --> 00:56:33.507]  Who tried to get the truth out about the USS Liberty being attacked by the Israelis?
[00:56:34.328 --> 00:56:43.270]  It was years and years ago that Tom Morrow told the press that no American President can stand up to Israel!
[00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:48.031]  And so, I don't know what more they need to do to take us over.
[00:56:49.651 --> 00:56:52.312]  They can elect whoever they want and defeat whoever they want.
[00:56:53.516 --> 00:57:11.165]  So, I'm not particularly, I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as a dictatorship that they would exercise through Bush as some form of a, you know, formal conspiracy or anything like that, but I think their influences, particularly on our foreign policy, and certainly in the Middle East, is overwhelming.
[00:57:11.745 --> 00:57:13.906]  They are the major player.
[00:57:14.166 --> 00:57:19.209]  Well, my point is the neocons are leading this charge for the dictatorship, so 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:57:21.337 --> 00:57:31.081]  Well, the neocons, they want to shut up critics because they have this hegemonic goal that commits us to a lot of war.
[00:57:31.161 --> 00:57:33.122]  But they can't put that genie back in the bottle.
[00:57:33.182 --> 00:57:38.065]  I mean, the hatred of the New World Order and the neocons is a rising tide.
[00:57:38.085 --> 00:57:46.808]  Yeah, but you know, people who have delusions don't necessarily think that there's any check to their power.
[00:57:46.848 --> 00:57:50.270]  So you think they really believe that Karl Rove line about they control reality?
[00:57:53.495 --> 00:57:55.577]  They could certainly believe it.
[00:57:55.697 --> 00:57:57.478]  I mean, Hitler believed it.
[00:57:57.498 --> 00:57:59.700]  He marched off into Russia.
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:06.806]  Even a great military strategist like Napoleon, probably the greatest the world's ever seen, he marched off into Russia.
[00:58:09.388 --> 00:58:21.217]  If a guy like that can get full of delusions, certainly these two-bit punk neocons who are basically ignorant people of very poor education, they could very easily
[00:58:21.883 --> 00:58:23.464]  You have these kinds of delusions, yeah.
[00:58:23.564 --> 00:58:25.245]  Two-bit punk neocons.
[00:58:25.405 --> 00:58:25.846]  I love it.
[00:58:25.886 --> 00:58:27.687]  Here's something else.
[00:58:27.707 --> 00:58:28.407]  60-second break.
[00:58:28.608 --> 00:58:29.668]  Seventy if you want to be technical.
[00:58:29.948 --> 00:58:30.469]  We'll come back.
[00:58:30.489 --> 00:58:31.970]  You'll have five minutes and we'll let you go.
[00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.171]  Just hit it hard.
[00:58:33.811 --> 00:58:39.235]  I'm going to shut the hell up and let you tell us about where you see the economy going and what's happening with inflation.
[00:58:41.937 --> 00:58:46.159]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.947 --> 00:59:02.111]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.791 --> 00:59:03.592]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.373 --> 00:59:05.274]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.934 --> 00:59:09.698]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.118 --> 00:59:14.182]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.262 --> 00:59:19.825]  All right, former Air Force officer, University of Texas professor, best-selling author.
[00:59:20.186 --> 00:59:21.847]  Tex Meyer's coming up in the next hour.
[00:59:21.867 --> 00:59:24.368]  We'll also have open phones for him.
[00:59:24.388 --> 00:59:27.510]  Then we got Michael Rivera, whatreallyhappened.com joining us in the third hour.
[00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:31.953]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, nationally syndicated columnist for Creator Syndicate.
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:39.926]  Alex, you know, you need to get better connected with your programmers because they told me the reason you wanted me on the show today was to talk about my last column on the economy, the return of the robber barons.
[01:00:01.283 --> 01:00:04.886]  People can find that on counterpunch or vdare.com.
[01:00:06.507 --> 01:00:29.305]  I'll skip over most of that and just point out that according to the latest government statistics on employment in the United States, one-fourth of all the jobs created over the past year, that is from June of 06 through June of 07, one-fourth of these jobs consist of waitresses and bartenders.
[01:00:30.925 --> 01:00:44.553]  So here we are, allegedly a superpower with a high-tech economy, and yet our graduates from our colleges and universities have to find employment as waitresses and bartenders.
[01:00:44.954 --> 01:00:46.855]  Where is the rest of the employment?
[01:00:46.955 --> 01:00:59.002]  Of the total 1.6 million net private sector jobs created over the past year, June through June, leisure and hospitality accounted for 30%.
[01:01:01.698 --> 01:01:05.000]  Education and health services accounted for 35%.
[01:01:07.261 --> 01:01:15.704]  Of that 35%, 100,000 jobs are in educational services and 456,000 are in health care and social assistance.
[01:01:16.365 --> 01:01:23.107]  Principally, ambulatory health care services and hospital support staff.
[01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.308]  That is, this is all
[01:01:25.089 --> 01:01:26.350]  So basically no high-tech?
[01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:54.945]  The U.S.
[01:01:55.005 --> 01:02:01.411]  economy created 51,000 jobs in architectural and engineering services.
[01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:03.693]  Wow!
[01:02:03.733 --> 01:02:05.675]  I've got to have you back on just on this subject.
[01:02:05.735 --> 01:02:08.318]  Man, that is incredible!
[01:02:08.878 --> 01:02:12.001]  It's been like this in the entire 21st century.
[01:02:12.041 --> 01:02:14.263]  This is the 7th year of this.
[01:02:19.170 --> 01:02:26.714]  To get into the inflation, as you probably know, the inflation measures that are used is called core inflation.
[01:02:26.754 --> 01:02:30.196]  The reason they like core inflation is it leaves out food and energy.
[01:02:30.996 --> 01:02:38.040]  So two of the biggest components in people's budgets aren't even measured in core inflation.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:45.424]  Even in the wider measure, which you see less and less, the Consumer Price Index, how do they measure housing?
[01:02:45.444 --> 01:02:46.865]  They don't put housing prices.
[01:02:47.526 --> 01:02:53.288]  They use, as a proxy for housing prices, they use the rental price of housing.
[01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:58.410]  Well, obviously, rental prices are less than mortgages.
[01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:00.371]  Otherwise, people would buy, right?
[01:03:02.091 --> 01:03:07.453]  So, the rental price of housing is another way they keep the measure down.
[01:03:07.613 --> 01:03:13.995]  Another way they do it is, if the price of beef goes up, they assume people switch to something lower priced, like chicken.
[01:03:14.235 --> 01:03:15.736]  Bottom line, where is inflation?
[01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:18.594]  Well, it's much higher than it's reported.
[01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:32.577]  Currently, in the second quarter, the CPI was running at 5.2%, but the rate that they use all the time, that you hear about, is core inflation.
[01:03:32.597 --> 01:03:32.997]  That's only 2.3%.
[01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:43.979]  So you can see, even with all their phony manipulation of the consumer price index, it's still 3 points, 3 percentage points higher.
[01:03:46.618 --> 01:03:47.903]  We're out of time, Doc.
[01:03:48.003 --> 01:03:50.674]  I need to get you back on specifically about this subject.
[01:03:53.601 --> 01:03:58.683]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:03:58.763 --> 01:04:06.065]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:04:06.225 --> 01:04:16.868]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:04:17.049 --> 01:04:21.590]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:26.853]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:04:27.073 --> 01:04:30.015]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:04:30.235 --> 01:04:39.920]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:04:56.568 --> 01:05:02.013]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.393 --> 01:05:10.040]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:17.782]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.183 --> 01:05:29.606]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.408]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.888 --> 01:05:35.808]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.149 --> 01:05:39.990]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:54.272 --> 01:06:01.055]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:07.818]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:18.202]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[01:06:18.682 --> 01:06:22.144]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[01:06:22.444 --> 01:06:25.146]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[01:06:25.767 --> 01:06:28.469]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[01:06:58.169 --> 01:06:58.810]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:00.591]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.251 --> 01:07:02.372]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.013 --> 01:07:03.833]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.574 --> 01:07:06.095]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.155 --> 01:07:09.918]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.318 --> 01:07:12.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.441]  Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.621 --> 01:07:20.724]  I'm going to try to twist Tech's arm and stay in a little bit of the next hour and we'll get Michael Rivera on with his monthly visit with us.
[01:07:21.265 --> 01:07:34.332]  We ran out of time getting into dictatorship and then what's happening with the economy with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, the father of economics, and he said even though he's out of town next week, he would like to come back on because he knows how large the audience is and actually talk about the economy.
[01:07:34.372 --> 01:07:35.413]  That's what he wants to get into.
[01:07:35.433 --> 01:07:40.456]  He says we talk about martial law every time he's on the show and he thinks our audience knows about that.
[01:07:41.056 --> 01:07:47.302]  So we will get into what's happening with the inflation indexes and the plunging dollar with a top economist.
[01:07:47.682 --> 01:07:48.983]  He'll be on with us sometime next week.
[01:07:49.644 --> 01:07:51.526]  Tex Meyers, Air Force officer.
[01:07:52.621 --> 01:08:08.252]  And of course, also best-selling author on multi-fronts, both educational and educational books, and then of course books purely for mainline education, textbooks, and then of course on the New World Order and criminal acts in government.
[01:08:08.692 --> 01:08:11.214]  A great political mind and a good personal friend of mine.
[01:08:11.254 --> 01:08:15.296]  He married myself and my wife and his lovely, wonderful wife, Wanda.
[01:08:15.316 --> 01:08:16.277]  They're just great people.
[01:08:16.677 --> 01:08:18.598]  And he's based right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:08:19.019 --> 01:08:21.160]  And I was on his show yesterday, the taping of it.
[01:08:21.180 --> 01:08:22.321]  I guess that's airing this weekend or
[01:08:22.821 --> 01:08:23.962]  Next weekend on the weekend.
[01:08:25.163 --> 01:08:27.645]  And we're just always honored to have Tex on with us.
[01:08:27.685 --> 01:08:29.046]  Tex, there's so much happening.
[01:08:29.266 --> 01:08:34.750]  I kind of like the theme of your show yesterday about lying government, lying New World Order.
[01:08:35.191 --> 01:08:38.453]  And we could get into that, just the whole culture of delusion and illusion.
[01:08:39.014 --> 01:08:41.115]  Or we could get into some of the new books.
[01:08:41.355 --> 01:08:45.759]  You just published one about the whole Illuminati slash Zionist connection.
[01:08:46.259 --> 01:08:49.782]  I mean, there's just so much going on, so much happening out there.
[01:08:49.822 --> 01:08:51.163]  What do you think is most important?
[01:08:52.081 --> 01:08:54.864]  Well, you know, I think the issue of lying.
[01:08:55.945 --> 01:08:59.027]  You know, some people out there might say, oh no, we're going to get a sermon.
[01:08:59.568 --> 01:09:02.010]  But this is not about a sermon.
[01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:06.553]  Although, you know, even Jesus himself said that he is the truth.
[01:09:07.654 --> 01:09:09.456]  And it's very significant, though.
[01:09:09.476 --> 01:09:18.884]  The whole Big Brother Police State system is based on a lie, and really a network of lies.
[01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:22.645]  That it's like a mosaic that they're putting together.
[01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:27.509]  And they come so fast and furiously, you know, it's almost like a NASCAR race.
[01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:31.293]  You can't keep track of all the drivers of the cars.
[01:09:32.554 --> 01:09:38.059]  But you know one thing, they expect to be at that finish line and bring in their new world order.
[01:09:38.659 --> 01:09:40.201]  So we're going to have to confound them.
[01:09:40.221 --> 01:09:42.182]  We're going to cause a few crack-ups.
[01:09:42.963 --> 01:09:45.946]  And I mean that in a good way because these are very evil
[01:09:47.256 --> 01:09:52.598]  Vehicles, you know, they're not like our friends Jeff Gordon and the others in the NASCAR race.
[01:09:52.818 --> 01:09:54.539]  So we really need to look at this.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:58.360]  Alex, you've done so much on your Terror Storm.
[01:09:58.421 --> 01:09:59.441]  It's an important video.
[01:09:59.701 --> 01:10:00.641]  We shouldn't forget that.
[01:10:00.661 --> 01:10:07.784]  I know you've got another video coming out soon, but this one, Terror Storm, it really lays out the lies.
[01:10:07.804 --> 01:10:10.685]  Now, you see, we have to remember something.
[01:10:11.486 --> 01:10:15.227]  You know, even the Bible talks about having a sure foundation.
[01:10:15.942 --> 01:10:19.083]  Well, Satan also has built a foundation.
[01:10:19.704 --> 01:10:27.687]  Everything that Bush did, everything that Clinton did before him, they built it on a foundation.
[01:10:27.727 --> 01:10:29.468]  They cooked the cake, so to speak.
[01:10:30.128 --> 01:10:31.068]  They did the cooking.
[01:10:31.108 --> 01:10:32.549]  They put in all the ingredients.
[01:10:33.249 --> 01:10:36.791]  And the icing will be their total police state control.
[01:10:37.311 --> 01:10:39.171]  So we've got to mess up that cake.
[01:10:39.211 --> 01:10:40.332]  We've got to get in there and
[01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:44.639]  And take out some of those ingredients and say, hey, wait just a minute.
[01:10:44.659 --> 01:10:46.601]  There's poison in this cake.
[01:10:46.981 --> 01:10:48.842]  This isn't sugar and flour and such.
[01:10:49.123 --> 01:10:50.123]  These are poisons.
[01:10:50.363 --> 01:10:56.849]  And by the way, Tex, would you say that they've got the, well, what's that called, where you squeeze it and it's got the end on it?
[01:10:56.889 --> 01:10:57.889]  You put the icing on?
[01:10:57.909 --> 01:11:03.934]  You know, they've got that pastry tool out right now applying the icing.
[01:11:04.775 --> 01:11:05.795]  Yeah, they really do.
[01:11:05.876 --> 01:11:10.099]  And, you know, I wrote a book some years ago called Circle of Intrigue.
[01:11:11.075 --> 01:11:14.838]  The Hidden Inner Circle of the Global Illuminati Conspiracy Circle of Intrigue.
[01:11:15.439 --> 01:11:21.024]  And I had a whole chapter in there talking about the use of pageantry and illusion.
[01:11:21.985 --> 01:11:23.386]  And both of those go together.
[01:11:24.727 --> 01:11:27.630]  You remember from the time we had the shock and awe?
[01:11:29.151 --> 01:11:33.455]  And we had Bush going up to the ground zero.
[01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:36.963]  And holding on to the shoulder of a fireman.
[01:11:36.983 --> 01:11:43.827]  Then he rode onto the aircraft carrier and declared mission accomplished.
[01:11:44.208 --> 01:11:49.891]  How many hundreds and hundreds of our men and women are dead since the mission was accomplished?
[01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:53.594]  And he just went to the collapsed bridge just to stand there and be our hero.
[01:11:54.694 --> 01:11:55.195]  Exactly.
[01:11:55.495 --> 01:11:56.556]  They do all these things.
[01:11:56.776 --> 01:11:58.497]  Everything that Jessica Lynch, the
[01:11:59.336 --> 01:12:01.418]  Uh, Corporal Pillman.
[01:12:01.819 --> 01:12:09.706]  Everything is based on pageantry, but then you have to mix in the illusion, which means it's all based on a lie.
[01:12:10.507 --> 01:12:18.614]  You know, the Hindus call it Maya, or illusion, and they believe the whole world is basically like a stage.
[01:12:18.954 --> 01:12:20.175]  Everything is scripted.
[01:12:20.216 --> 01:12:24.099]  Well, you know, I'm not a Hindu, but I'm beginning to see
[01:12:25.627 --> 01:12:31.471]  The amazing thing that you have revealed in Terror Storm, that it is pageantry and illusion.
[01:12:31.511 --> 01:12:38.115]  Now, unfortunately, you know, we're inside this great grand theater of illusion.
[01:12:38.595 --> 01:12:46.240]  But when the show's over, when the third act is finished, we're all going to be in a concentration camp if these people have their way.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:52.804]  We're not going to walk out and get in your taxi or certainly your limo or whatever car you have.
[01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:57.781]  Uh, you're not going to be able to get in and go and walk away and say, what a nice movie.
[01:12:58.481 --> 01:13:00.762]  I'm telling you, they're going to wrap you up in the movie.
[01:13:00.782 --> 01:13:06.585]  It's sort of like the story of the guy that was bemused by the cannibals eating up the pot.
[01:13:06.985 --> 01:13:08.226]  And he said, wants to eat.
[01:13:08.286 --> 01:13:08.986]  And they said, you!
[01:13:09.006 --> 01:13:10.747]  You know?
[01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.314]  So this is where we're at now.
[01:13:13.414 --> 01:13:16.335]  Illusion leads to death, to bloodshed.
[01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:26.999]  Well that's what Hitler and Stalin to a certain extent, but Hitler and Goebbels, the nighttime rallies, all the pageantry, constant parades, huge banners everywhere.
[01:13:27.939 --> 01:13:30.660]  But look what it led to, 20 million plus dead Germans alone.
[01:13:31.601 --> 01:13:32.021]  That's right.
[01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:35.862]  You know, I'm working on a book now, Alex, just give your people a little hint.
[01:13:36.142 --> 01:13:38.043]  It's called Monumental Architecture.
[01:13:39.054 --> 01:13:43.537]  Even architecture, even buildings are designed as occult, satanic symbols.
[01:13:44.577 --> 01:13:48.240]  And they are part of this pageantry and illusion cycle.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:51.722]  And again, we go down to the lion.
[01:13:52.202 --> 01:13:58.566]  Today, maybe we can talk about some things, even Pearl Harbor, because I have some astonishing new information.
[01:13:59.164 --> 01:14:03.207]  But I don't think it's been revealed on any national radio program.
[01:14:03.227 --> 01:14:06.369]  I'd like to reveal on your program today for the first time.
[01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:14.576]  Absolutely, but instead of graciously plugging Terror Storm, Codex Magica, you know, we've got it at Infowars.com.
[01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:15.717]  It is the preeminent book.
[01:14:16.317 --> 01:14:26.765]  It's the size of basically the Dallas phone book of documents, photos, how they're doing the symbolism, how they believe that they energize themselves, how they believe it creates
[01:14:27.485 --> 01:14:29.326]  We're good to go.
[01:14:47.335 --> 01:14:47.896]  Right in there.
[01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:54.081]  So I'm very excited, Tex, to hear that you're getting into the... I know you've been into it forever, covering the architecture of all of it.
[01:14:54.121 --> 01:14:57.924]  But before we go any further, you've also got a free newsletter.
[01:14:58.324 --> 01:15:03.108]  People can call and get a free one and then get on the list and have it mailed out to them each month.
[01:15:03.168 --> 01:15:06.070]  A very powerful, always cutting-edge type material.
[01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:07.531]  How do folks call and get the free newsletter?
[01:15:07.571 --> 01:15:11.094]  How do they call and get a copy of your newest book, Codex Magicka?
[01:15:12.309 --> 01:15:15.991]  Alex, of course, you know, they might want to get a preview of the book.
[01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.772]  I appreciate your kindness in mentioning it.
[01:15:18.212 --> 01:15:26.696]  They can go on PowerOfProphecy.com, they can go on InfoWars.com, and I appreciate your organization offering Codex Magicka.
[01:15:26.736 --> 01:15:33.739]  Go on the search engine there, look up Codex Magicka on your book list, or go to MyPowerOfProphecy.com.
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.442]  At the same time, they can actually put on their computer
[01:15:40.589 --> 01:15:59.923]  mailing list to get our newsletter each month just sign up on our home page of PowerProperty.com or they can just call us toll free 1-800-234-9673 and say hey I just heard on the Alex Jones Show you'll send me a free issue and we'll do that we'll send the free issue nobody will ever call.
[01:15:59.943 --> 01:16:03.345]  Now give that number out slow because after you leave I'm going to get 50 phone calls wanting that number.
[01:16:03.365 --> 01:16:04.186]  Give them that number please.
[01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:05.707]  Okay it's toll free 1-800-234-9673
[01:16:09.070 --> 01:16:09.490]  9-6-7-3.
[01:16:09.991 --> 01:16:17.237]  I hope people will wait until after the program because we've got so much exciting information.
[01:16:17.757 --> 01:16:22.421]  For example, you just mentioned, we were just fixing to talk about World War II.
[01:16:23.301 --> 01:16:27.605]  You know, that whole war, of course the Nazis were evil, no doubt about it.
[01:16:28.503 --> 01:16:31.465]  And one of our allies, the Communists, were also evil.
[01:16:31.505 --> 01:16:32.205]  We took sides.
[01:16:32.665 --> 01:16:33.766]  Two scorpions in a bottle.
[01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.967]  We said, okay, we're going to favor this scorpion.
[01:16:36.047 --> 01:16:39.168]  And the Communists killed three times as many, but that was our little buddy.
[01:16:39.969 --> 01:16:42.130]  Yeah, Joseph, you know, Uncle Joseph.
[01:16:42.710 --> 01:16:44.071]  Uncle Joe to FDR.
[01:16:44.391 --> 01:16:46.432]  But everything was based on illusion.
[01:16:46.972 --> 01:16:53.415]  And in Codex Magicka, I have a picture of Sir Winston Churchill, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, our great ally.
[01:16:54.013 --> 01:16:55.274]  I've seen it in mainstream books.
[01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:16.394]  Yeah, Codex Magicka has a picture like that, too, showing him.
[01:17:16.414 --> 01:17:21.941]  Of course, FDR and his Masonic cohort, who was the Secretary of Agriculture, Mr. Henry Wallace, who later ran on the Socialist Worker
[01:17:34.628 --> 01:17:42.772]  Workers' Party ticket for President, but Wallace and he conspired together and brought forth the all-seeing eye and the pyramid on our $1 bill.
[01:17:43.092 --> 01:17:44.153]  Here again, magic!
[01:17:44.633 --> 01:18:00.181]  The new Novus Ordo Seclorum, the new world order, in the midst of chaos and suffering and 50 million people perishing in the flames of World War II, they present forth their goal, their objective, which is the Novus Ordo Seclorum, right on our major
[01:18:00.672 --> 01:18:02.313]  Currency note, the $1 bill.
[01:18:02.633 --> 01:18:04.975]  This is how much they're into witchcraft and magic.
[01:18:05.015 --> 01:18:06.076]  Now, Bush is too.
[01:18:06.536 --> 01:18:07.797]  Member of Order of Skull and Bones.
[01:18:08.237 --> 01:18:09.438]  So was Kerry, of course.
[01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:18.764]  And Hillary, listen, this'll be, if she is elected, it will be the first lesbian witch ever elected president.
[01:18:18.804 --> 01:18:21.867]  We've had first ladies who were lesbian witches.
[01:18:21.907 --> 01:18:25.289]  We had Eleanor Roosevelt, who had a female lover in the White House.
[01:18:25.908 --> 01:18:39.443]  And at Hyde Park, the Presidential Library in New York of Franklin Roosevelt, Eleanor Roosevelt, they have now copies on display of her love letters to her lesbian live-in lover, Miss Hickok.
[01:18:40.063 --> 01:18:40.464]  It's amazing.
[01:18:40.484 --> 01:18:43.287]  Talking about how to kiss your lips and all kinds of junk like that.
[01:18:43.467 --> 01:18:44.288]  Well, we'll stay there.
[01:18:45.129 --> 01:18:45.710]  Text Mars.
[01:18:46.070 --> 01:18:46.851]  We're gonna come right back.
[01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:56.631]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:18:56.952 --> 01:19:01.874]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:19:02.134 --> 01:19:06.496]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:15.700]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:19.502]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:19:19.802 --> 01:19:24.847]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:31.873]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:19:32.353 --> 01:19:32.894]  What about you?
[01:19:33.653 --> 01:19:38.996]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:19:57.378 --> 01:20:00.879]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[01:20:35.515 --> 01:20:37.056]  And remember, if you read the MIDAS Report,
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:56.974]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.714 --> 01:21:02.880]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:21:03.769 --> 01:21:10.653]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:21:11.714 --> 01:21:20.299]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:29.385]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:33.332 --> 01:21:33.592]  Call now.

[01:21:54.315 --> 01:21:54.955]  Morning, neighbor!
[01:21:55.315 --> 01:21:56.996]  Hey, shouldn't you be at work?
[01:21:57.416 --> 01:21:57.736]  I am.
[01:21:57.976 --> 01:21:59.976]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[01:22:00.196 --> 01:22:00.857]  What do you mean?
[01:22:00.877 --> 01:22:03.937]  Well, I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:22:04.177 --> 01:22:06.318]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[01:22:06.458 --> 01:22:07.618]  But I never have to go to work.
[01:22:07.918 --> 01:22:08.838]  So, what do you do?
[01:22:09.138 --> 01:22:10.259]  Not very much at all now.
[01:22:10.539 --> 01:22:12.359]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[01:22:12.379 --> 01:22:13.239]  It's got a funny name.
[01:22:13.299 --> 01:22:15.600]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:17.320]  That is funny.
[01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:22.222]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[01:22:22.762 --> 01:22:24.803]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[01:22:24.823 --> 01:22:27.744]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[01:22:27.924 --> 01:22:28.604]  You should log on.
[01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:30.625]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[01:22:30.805 --> 01:22:32.266]  So, what was that website?
[01:22:32.346 --> 01:22:37.768]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait.
[01:22:37.788 --> 01:22:39.528]  I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[01:22:39.708 --> 01:22:40.749]  You don't need to write it down.
[01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.649]  It's easy to remember.
[01:22:41.909 --> 01:22:44.610]  DidYouRobBillGates.com
[01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:45.230]  Yeah!
[01:22:45.611 --> 01:22:48.173]  DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:22:48.573 --> 01:22:49.234]  That is easy!
[01:22:49.594 --> 01:22:52.276]  It's easy, and the money is awesome!
[01:22:53.437 --> 01:22:55.539]  Big John!
[01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:59.463]  Big John!
[01:22:59.503 --> 01:23:02.065]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:23:02.105 --> 01:23:03.906]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:23:04.507 --> 01:23:07.670]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:23:07.690 --> 01:23:11.113]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to Big John.
[01:23:14.734 --> 01:23:20.357]  Text Mars is our guest coming to you live from Austin, Texas via the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:20.397 --> 01:23:29.502]  This is a short segment so we're going to get into one of the big lies that we saw today and yesterday concerning this planet and what's going on.
[01:23:29.522 --> 01:23:32.964]  Then we're going to get into the Pearl Harbor research that he's done in the next segment.
[01:23:33.724 --> 01:23:35.325]  Text Mohammed Karzai.
[01:23:35.945 --> 01:23:38.326]  This is the Unicol executive they installed.
[01:23:38.447 --> 01:23:39.827]  Literally they've had a staged election.
[01:23:39.847 --> 01:23:41.068]  That's well documented.
[01:23:42.049 --> 01:23:46.012]  And, uh, but he mucked or bumped heads with Lord Bush yesterday.
[01:23:47.493 --> 01:23:47.933]  That's right.
[01:23:48.273 --> 01:24:04.163]  You know, both he and the puppet that we put in office there in Iraq have problems because the people of those countries see who the real oppressor is, and it's Imperial America, and it's Zionist-Brand Israel.
[01:24:04.523 --> 01:24:07.325]  So Karzai has a little problem, but I think it's interesting today.
[01:24:07.405 --> 01:24:08.365]  Talk about a lie.
[01:24:09.146 --> 01:24:10.667]  Karzai was asked by the press
[01:24:11.660 --> 01:24:12.640]  What about Iran?
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:22.543]  Because the propaganda coming out of the Bush administration and the Pentagon is that Iran is the one funding and doing all the dirty work inside of Afghanistan.
[01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:26.264]  Of course, I was asked about this, and he says, no, no, no, no!
[01:24:26.864 --> 01:24:28.924]  Iran is a big help to us!
[01:24:29.464 --> 01:24:31.845]  They're cooperating against the Taliban.
[01:24:32.405 --> 01:24:33.866]  You know, in other words, they're our friends!
[01:24:33.906 --> 01:24:34.946]  They're our allies!
[01:24:35.186 --> 01:24:39.587]  Ahmadinejad, who Bush portrays as some new Hitler,
[01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:43.852]  You know, as Karzai says, they're Afghanistan's friends.
[01:24:44.073 --> 01:24:47.794]  Well, Bush tried to correct it right away and said, oh no, that's not true.
[01:24:49.115 --> 01:24:54.357]  You know, Iran is a problem and, you know, they're destabilizing the Middle East.
[01:24:55.157 --> 01:25:04.521]  Now, this is all part of, of course, the Bush strategy to try to convince the American people that our next big war should be fought against Iran.
[01:25:04.541 --> 01:25:07.422]  So we're going to have another big explosion of bloodshed.
[01:25:08.142 --> 01:25:09.863]  They've already sent this General Berger
[01:25:10.655 --> 01:25:12.096]  Who's a con man, evidently.
[01:25:12.136 --> 01:25:14.357]  He's going to be the new conduit for lies.
[01:25:14.397 --> 01:25:21.400]  You see, they can't trust the military brass on scene there in Iraq.
[01:25:21.460 --> 01:25:23.761]  Because the military's instinct is to win.
[01:25:23.781 --> 01:25:28.003]  Yeah, and you know, there's a number of military people who are not liars.
[01:25:28.023 --> 01:25:30.064]  You know, I was in the Air Force for 20 years.
[01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:31.225]  I retired as an officer.
[01:25:31.665 --> 01:25:33.466]  There's a lot of guys that are patriotic there.
[01:25:33.506 --> 01:25:35.807]  They just don't want to go along with these lies.
[01:25:36.485 --> 01:25:41.008]  But what they do is they groom certain people, they give them stars, they promote them.
[01:25:41.028 --> 01:25:45.731]  You know, they began back in the days of Alexander Haig, who was a desk jockey.
[01:25:45.751 --> 01:25:54.676]  And they give people like Colin Powell and Alexander Haig, and now evidently there's General Berkner, and they become conduits for lies.
[01:25:55.577 --> 01:25:57.058]  So, that's what they have now.
[01:25:57.078 --> 01:26:03.442]  Well, that's just like they created the Office of Special Plans in the Pentagon to lie and create fake intelligence, because the Pentagon wouldn't do it.
[01:26:03.462 --> 01:26:03.862]  That's right.
[01:26:04.649 --> 01:26:09.753]  And, of course, they had neocons running that office, but they took in a couple of officers.
[01:26:09.813 --> 01:26:19.620]  Colonel Franklin, who, of course, now was indicted and admitted he was guilty of spying for Zionist Israel, for AIPAC.
[01:26:19.740 --> 01:26:28.307]  And now two of the officials of AIPAC are going to go on trial, too, for spying, sabotage, you might say, against America, our supposed ally.
[01:26:28.507 --> 01:26:32.650]  But you're right, there's the Office of Special Plans, then the Office of Strategic Influence,
[01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:37.614]  Uh, and when they were found out, they just changed the name of these offices in the Pentagon.
[01:26:38.495 --> 01:26:46.864]  Now, the Office of Strategic Influence publicly said it was planning news and paper news overseas, but it turned out billions in fake news was purchased here domestically.
[01:26:47.965 --> 01:26:48.325]  That's right.
[01:26:48.586 --> 01:26:51.749]  Newspapers, you know, they have these video VNRs, I think they're called.
[01:26:52.287 --> 01:26:53.908]  News releases, video news releases.
[01:26:54.449 --> 01:27:00.213]  It looks like, you know, you're watching like Channel 4 News or something in some city, but really it's all just fake.
[01:27:00.473 --> 01:27:10.420]  They even have an attractive female anchor, an attractive male anchor, and they're chatting about how wonderful the Iraq War is and all the great things that are going on there.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:18.105]  These things have been released and hundreds of TV stations play these thinking that they're coming from some legitimate news source.
[01:27:19.384 --> 01:27:20.845]  So this is an amazing thing.
[01:27:20.865 --> 01:27:25.450]  Hitler and Stalin, you know, it's interesting.
[01:27:26.151 --> 01:27:32.017]  The number one news source during the Communist era in Russia, Alex, was called Pravda.
[01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:33.779]  That was their newspaper.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:38.043]  And Pravda, the Russian word, means truth.
[01:27:38.864 --> 01:27:41.527]  Of course, it was a lie, but it was truth.
[01:27:42.037 --> 01:27:51.240]  And I remember reading the publisher of USA Today, after Gorbachev ended supposedly the Iron Curtain, he went over to visit and he visited Provden.
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:57.802]  They said they were telling the American newsmen, oh we're changed now, we're going to tell the truth here in Russia.
[01:27:58.262 --> 01:28:06.444]  But he noticed that they had not taken down a huge sign in their major newsroom, and it overshadowed
[01:28:07.057 --> 01:28:23.865]  Everything they were doing at Pravda, which supposedly means truth, and it was a quote from Lenin, and basically what he said, and let me paraphrase it, he said, he said, words are more powerful than armaments, than tanks, and guns, and airplanes.
[01:28:24.469 --> 01:28:29.894]  How can we allow people to say bad things about the government, being that words are so powerful?
[01:28:30.614 --> 01:28:31.315]  Stay there, Tex.
[01:28:31.335 --> 01:28:33.157]  We'll continue with this on the other side.
[01:28:33.217 --> 01:28:35.218]  I've got one more little caveat about Iran.
[01:28:35.238 --> 01:28:36.479]  I want to get your take on that.
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:38.181]  We'll get into Pearl Harbor and a lot more.
[01:28:38.541 --> 01:28:42.024]  Best-selling author, pastor, Air Force officer, Tex Marsh.
[01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:45.047]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:47.089]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.009 --> 01:28:50.692]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.917 --> 01:29:03.427]  Ladies, if you've done tons of crunches and hours of cardio to burn off that puffy little pouch of fat under your belly and haven't succeeded, maybe it's because it really isn't fat.
[01:29:03.667 --> 01:29:09.053]  Often that puffiness is simply accumulated gas and undigested food from too many meals.
[01:29:09.233 --> 01:29:15.099]  If that's your problem, Allow Colon and Body Cleanse can help you rid yourself of that buildup and bloat.
[01:29:15.340 --> 01:29:16.421]  Allow Cleanse is quick
[01:29:16.801 --> 01:29:19.303]  Easy and gentle and it really works.
[01:29:19.503 --> 01:29:26.869]  For years Hollywood stars have raved about colon cleansing and how it helps maintain their youthful figure and baby soft skin.
[01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:27.970]  You will too!
[01:29:28.210 --> 01:29:31.233]  Now you can try Aloe Colon and Body Cleanse for free!

[01:30:57.281 --> 01:31:00.844]  Here's Dr. John Matson, a naturopathic doctor and his views on Cardivite.

[01:31:06.350 --> 01:31:11.874]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work, we can just put them on cardivite and things start to work almost right away.
[01:31:12.135 --> 01:31:20.321]  I've had dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them, and what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect.

[01:31:54.933 --> 01:32:00.457]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:32:02.054 --> 01:32:21.853]  There was something so pleasant about that place Even your emotions had an echo in so much space And when you're out there, well out there, yeah I was out of touch But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
[01:32:26.152 --> 01:32:26.613]  Welcome back.

[01:35:05.826 --> 01:35:06.847]  It's a nice newsletter.
[01:35:07.467 --> 01:35:10.709]  Tex is so nice that he helped me duplicate it and do it.
[01:35:10.729 --> 01:35:11.789]  It was too expensive for me to do.
[01:35:11.809 --> 01:35:13.690]  I mean, it's such nice paper, so big.
[01:35:13.750 --> 01:35:16.092]  I tried it out, sent it out to like 10,000 people.
[01:35:16.112 --> 01:35:18.853]  I think Tex sends it out to like, I forget, it's a lot more than I do.
[01:35:19.594 --> 01:35:21.475]  And I use the same printing company, same people.
[01:35:21.535 --> 01:35:24.236]  I mean, these things are, I mean, no expenses spared.
[01:35:24.256 --> 01:35:28.118]  These are really nice newsletters and I hope you get it.
[01:35:28.138 --> 01:35:31.200]  And Tex, go ahead and give folks that number out again to get a free newsletter.
[01:35:31.886 --> 01:35:33.086]  Well thank you Alex.
[01:35:33.146 --> 01:35:37.467]  It will be 1-800-234-9673.
[01:35:37.487 --> 01:35:37.627]  1-800-234-9673.
[01:35:37.667 --> 01:35:43.909]  And simply say I'd like the newsletter and we'll be glad to send that to you.
[01:35:44.229 --> 01:35:47.210]  And again, we're not going to get your phone number and things like that.
[01:35:47.230 --> 01:35:48.130]  We're not going to be calling you.
[01:35:48.150 --> 01:35:51.091]  We're not going to send you, you know, anything about asking for money.
[01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:52.491]  You don't have to worry about that at all.
[01:35:53.198 --> 01:35:53.739]  Absolutely.
[01:35:53.779 --> 01:35:57.581]  In fact, it's just a newsletter you put out and I guess we're able to pay for it.
[01:35:57.601 --> 01:36:01.864]  It's got a few ads or for whatever the great videos and books you've got out at the time are.
[01:36:02.164 --> 01:36:09.849]  Again, folks, every time, I mean, I get the newsletter and every time I sit down, it's great when I'm eating breakfast and, you know, read through it because I learn stuff all the time.
[01:36:09.889 --> 01:36:10.970]  I learn a lot from Tex.
[01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:15.093]  On several of my films, three or four of them, I've gone into his huge archive.
[01:36:15.113 --> 01:36:20.496]  He's got several big rooms just filled to the ceiling with well-archived documents, news articles.
[01:36:21.137 --> 01:36:22.618]  I have rated your archives.
[01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:32.751]  Well, listen, you're always welcome to do that, because I've gotten a lot of information from watching your videos and talking with you over the years, Alex.
[01:36:32.831 --> 01:36:37.852]  But, yeah, of course, my wife here complains that I'm junked up.
[01:36:38.252 --> 01:36:39.852]  I can barely get out of my desk here.
[01:36:39.872 --> 01:36:46.174]  The place is full of archives, as you mentioned, and boxes of books and magazine articles.
[01:36:46.214 --> 01:36:47.655]  And, of course, now I have about 10,000, it appears like,
[01:36:49.628 --> 01:36:53.791]  Books and such are working on this new project I have.
[01:36:53.971 --> 01:36:55.592]  How many books have you written total?
[01:36:56.272 --> 01:36:58.794]  I think I've written 43 books.
[01:36:59.454 --> 01:37:04.578]  Of course, many booklets and video documentaries and things like that, but actual books, I think 43.
[01:37:04.618 --> 01:37:06.959]  I've contributed to a number of others.
[01:37:06.999 --> 01:37:08.340]  This was over many years, of course.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:11.082]  I began by writing high technology books.
[01:37:11.542 --> 01:37:16.245]  I wrote the first encyclopedia of personal home robots.
[01:37:17.045 --> 01:37:21.414]  Believe it or not, it was a main selection of the computer and the electronic book clubs.
[01:37:22.276 --> 01:37:23.379]  So, I wrote a lot.
[01:37:23.399 --> 01:37:26.746]  I wrote the first book on careers with robots.
[01:37:27.415 --> 01:37:43.142]  You also ended up being one of the few people ever to have your book on how to pass some different types of military tests, and then it was only chosen, I mean printed by two publishers, and I think you were the only person they ever chose your book for both publications, right?
[01:37:43.722 --> 01:37:55.907]  Yes, everyone who goes in the military service has to take the ASVAB test, and so we have a book called Barron's How to Prepare for the Armed Forces Test that I authored
[01:37:57.482 --> 01:38:03.685]  But, you know, it's been now 20 years, and I know it was the work of God who put me in this ministry.
[01:38:04.026 --> 01:38:06.487]  And my whole goal has been based on truth.
[01:38:06.607 --> 01:38:07.768]  What is the truth?
[01:38:08.928 --> 01:38:13.051]  And I have found that there's so many fictions, so much history.
[01:38:13.531 --> 01:38:19.355]  You know, Napoleon basically said, history is a set of lies prearranged.
[01:38:19.835 --> 01:38:20.796]  That was Napoleon.
[01:38:20.856 --> 01:38:21.216]  Wow.
[01:38:21.576 --> 01:38:24.498]  A set of lies that are prearranged.
[01:38:25.422 --> 01:38:26.742]  Now, I don't like that.
[01:38:26.762 --> 01:38:34.645]  I don't like to live amidst pre-arranged lies, where everywhere you turn, there's nothing but propaganda.
[01:38:34.985 --> 01:38:36.485]  I was recently reading, you know, H.G.
[01:38:36.545 --> 01:38:39.366]  Wells is quite a fascinating writer.
[01:38:39.406 --> 01:38:40.666]  Remember the Invisible Man?
[01:38:41.206 --> 01:38:43.207]  Top eugenicist.
[01:38:43.787 --> 01:38:45.087]  Yeah, but that is true.
[01:38:45.127 --> 01:38:47.328]  Well, he was an illuminist, of course.
[01:38:48.067 --> 01:38:49.407]  A member of the conspiracy.
[01:38:49.787 --> 01:38:58.970]  He wrote, at the same time he wrote The Invisible Man and The Time Machine that we might enjoy, he also wrote the open conspiracy blueprints for a world revolution.
[01:38:59.830 --> 01:39:01.190]  So he was one of the conspirators.
[01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:02.171]  Now here's the interesting thing.
[01:39:02.191 --> 01:39:05.732]  They called you and me, Alex, conspiracy theorists.
[01:39:06.272 --> 01:39:12.773]  But Wells really gave it away when he said, what this really is, is a conspiracy of the elite.
[01:39:12.993 --> 01:39:15.034]  And listen to what he says, because I think this is so important.
[01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:19.172]  He said, quote, now this is in his book called The Open Conspiracy.
[01:39:19.712 --> 01:39:30.277]  He says, the conspiracy, that's of the elite, must begin as a movement of explanation and propaganda.
[01:39:31.818 --> 01:39:39.422]  So for them to take over the world and bring in their world federation, as Alfred Lord Tennyson called it in his poem, Loxley Hall,
[01:39:40.549 --> 01:39:41.410]  There's two elements.
[01:39:41.650 --> 01:39:45.031]  It must be a movement by the elite, and they have to use explanation.
[01:39:45.252 --> 01:39:49.113]  So they have to explain the way things are supposed to be or are.
[01:39:49.934 --> 01:39:53.616]  What's really happening in Iraq, they're going to explain it to us, Alex.
[01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:55.456]  What's happening in Afghanistan?
[01:39:55.496 --> 01:39:57.037]  What happened with Corporal Tillman?
[01:39:58.358 --> 01:39:59.638]  Private Jessica?
[01:39:59.658 --> 01:40:04.281]  They're going to explain the way they want us to understand it, put their spin on it.
[01:40:04.321 --> 01:40:06.862]  And the second element is propaganda.
[01:40:08.284 --> 01:40:10.806]  And I think those are the two elements that we have now.
[01:40:11.267 --> 01:40:22.375]  They control the mass media, and we're really the only outlets people can believe in as truth, because we don't have any dog in the hunt other than American patriotism.
[01:40:23.336 --> 01:40:26.078]  And a lot of people say, so you're part of the patriot movement.
[01:40:26.959 --> 01:40:37.687]  And I don't know why, as much a patriot as I am, I guess I come from small-town America, and, you know, I'm the kind of guy, when I joined the Air Force at the young age of 18, when I said the Pledge of Allegiance,
[01:40:38.950 --> 01:40:40.051]  I had tears in my eyes.
[01:40:41.051 --> 01:40:42.672]  Because I love this great country.
[01:40:42.932 --> 01:40:47.193]  But as great as that feeling, and I know you're just like that Alex, I've met you many times.
[01:40:48.154 --> 01:40:54.696]  As great as that is, I have to tell you, I love the truth more.
[01:40:54.716 --> 01:40:56.577]  Absolutely.
[01:40:57.362 --> 01:41:02.444]  Because really, a nation that's based on a fabric of lies cannot stand.
[01:41:02.784 --> 01:41:04.765]  Justice be done, though the heavens fall.
[01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:20.351]  And just mentioning a little side point, when you brought up Mohammed Karzai, when Bush is up there in a speech going, they're pure evil, they're helping the Taliban overthrow our government there, Al-Qaeda, and Karzai goes, well actually, they're helping us, they're not bad.
[01:41:20.371 --> 01:41:22.332]  At least on that issue.
[01:41:22.572 --> 01:41:24.833]  I'm not defending any of these regimes.
[01:41:24.853 --> 01:41:26.434]  There's always evil in high places, folks.
[01:41:28.198 --> 01:41:30.520]  Iran is Shiite, folks, okay?
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:38.147]  That's the opposite of Wahhabi, the opposite of what the Pashtuns follow, of what the Taliban slash Al-Qaeda is.
[01:41:38.167 --> 01:41:40.349]  There's the two major brands of Islam.
[01:41:41.107 --> 01:41:45.668]  You know, one is Lex Luthor, the other is Superman, depending on which side of the stripe the Muslim's on.
[01:41:45.908 --> 01:41:47.748]  But the point is, it's black and white.
[01:41:47.768 --> 01:41:49.749]  It's two separate groups.
[01:41:50.369 --> 01:41:55.810]  And so, they get on the news and go, Iran's funding Al-Qaeda insurgency in Iraq.
[01:41:56.430 --> 01:41:58.870]  Iran is the opposite of Al-Qaeda.
[01:41:58.970 --> 01:42:07.332]  And then you actually read the White House announcement a few months ago, what we knew three years ago they were doing, Cy Hearst reported on it, that they're actually using Wahhabists and
[01:42:08.516 --> 01:42:15.170]  You know, real Al Qaeda federated groups who attack Iran in their western province to destabilize.
[01:42:15.451 --> 01:42:19.820]  So in reality, the criminals that run our government are actually using real Al Qaeda.
[01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:22.900]  To attack Iran.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.821]  Iran is always kicking them out.
[01:42:24.981 --> 01:42:30.266]  Iran has been helping go after any of these people in their border regions because they don't like them.
[01:42:30.486 --> 01:42:31.747]  They want to overthrow Iran.
[01:42:32.107 --> 01:42:40.254]  And then Bush has the nerve to lie and say that Iran is behind Al-Qaeda when it's apples and oranges.
[01:42:40.394 --> 01:42:44.578]  And that's so simple, but I try to explain it to people on the street.
[01:42:45.719 --> 01:42:47.440]  It's like people are mesmerized.
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.481]  They can't think.
[01:42:48.661 --> 01:42:49.442]  I don't understand it.
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:56.244]  Well, it is part of the psychodrama, the theater, that's been arranged for us.
[01:42:56.304 --> 01:43:01.348]  Remember, that's the explanation and propaganda that the conspiracy elite are using.
[01:43:01.888 --> 01:43:06.772]  So it is the pageantry and illusion, and most people cannot break away from that.
[01:43:06.792 --> 01:43:11.115]  You know, we were talking earlier about the lie of Pearl Harbor.
[01:43:11.835 --> 01:43:18.440]  Because so many people say to you, and I know they do me too, Alex, and to every person who's in the Patriot Truth Movement, they say,
[01:43:19.367 --> 01:43:26.671]  Surely, you're not suggesting that our government would kill 3,000 people on 9-11.
[01:43:26.851 --> 01:43:27.452]  Surely!
[01:43:28.112 --> 01:43:30.333]  What monsters would do such a thing?
[01:43:30.353 --> 01:43:37.097]  But of course, life is nothing to these evil planners.
[01:43:38.678 --> 01:43:41.599]  And 3,000, that's approximately what also died at Pearl Harbor.
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:46.462]  You know, you mentioned this illusion and the pageantry and how people are mesmerized.
[01:43:47.482 --> 01:43:48.683]  I was just reading a book
[01:43:49.592 --> 01:43:59.217]  recently called, and the title is immaterial, it's a little bit awkward, it's called, Clawson's Commentaries on Morals and Dogma.
[01:43:59.877 --> 01:44:12.783]  Henry C. Clawson was a 33rd degree mason and the sovereign grand commander of all of Freemasonry, beginning in 1969, and he was there for about 20 years or so, okay?
[01:44:13.003 --> 01:44:14.524]  So this is in our lifetimes.
[01:44:15.106 --> 01:44:27.254]  Henry C. Clawson, he wrote this book that really comments on Albert Pike's magic witchcraft text that's the classic textbook for all Masons called Morals and Dogma.
[01:44:27.575 --> 01:44:32.138]  But I noticed on something, I got to page 212 and he was talking about the Wizard of Oz!
[01:44:32.158 --> 01:44:37.061]  Well, what has that got to do with Freemasons and with the Illuminati conspiracy?
[01:44:37.581 --> 01:44:42.585]  He talks about the royal secret that the elite, you know, have.
[01:44:43.123 --> 01:44:44.884]  These God-men, these Olympians.
[01:44:45.645 --> 01:44:51.828]  And he said, you must find it for yourself like Dorothy of the Wizard of Oz wearing magic slippers.
[01:44:52.789 --> 01:44:55.991]  So, you know, they're telling their people, this is magic.
[01:44:56.431 --> 01:44:57.932]  And you've got to be a magician.
[01:44:58.312 --> 01:45:06.738]  And you've got to deceive the people by mesmerizing them, by hypnotizing them, by over and over repeating the same lies.
[01:45:07.598 --> 01:45:10.400]  Now, the interesting thing about this, and you're going to love this, Alex,
[01:45:11.198 --> 01:45:16.922]  This Henry C. Clawson, Sovereign Grand Commander of International Scottish Rite Freemasonry.
[01:45:17.283 --> 01:45:22.907]  By the way, he was also an illustrious, potentate member of the United Lodge of Great Britain.
[01:45:22.947 --> 01:45:24.448]  You know, it all works together, doesn't it?
[01:45:25.369 --> 01:45:27.991]  He was also a member of the Bohemian Club.
[01:45:29.071 --> 01:45:29.151]  Oh.
[01:45:29.172 --> 01:45:30.092]  In San Francisco.
[01:45:30.232 --> 01:45:30.893]  I didn't know that.
[01:45:31.233 --> 01:45:32.294]  Yeah.
[01:45:32.394 --> 01:45:33.235]  But that's not all.
[01:45:33.615 --> 01:45:38.098]  I was looking at this biography in the back about the author on page 213.
[01:45:38.639 --> 01:45:39.339]  You won't believe this.
[01:45:39.359 --> 01:45:40.340]  The guy was an attorney.
[01:45:41.522 --> 01:45:50.769]  He wins the Army in 1942 during World War II, and became a Lieutenant Colonel in the Judge Advocate General's office.
[01:45:51.249 --> 01:45:52.330]  But now listen to this!
[01:45:54.511 --> 01:46:05.539]  He was the personal appointee, it says here, of FDR's Secretary of War, Henry Stimson, on the Army's Pearl Harbor Board!
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:06.460]  Wow!
[01:46:07.156 --> 01:46:34.583]  Now, remember the guy, member of Bohemian Grove, 33rd Degree Mason, went on to become the Sovereign Grand Commander, a corrupt attorney out of San Francisco, and here he is on the Pearl Harbor Board, it says, he also conducted further investigations into the Pearl Harbor disaster, and was rewarded with a Legion of Merit for his judgment.
[01:46:35.203 --> 01:46:35.303]  Oh!
[01:46:36.475 --> 01:46:45.502]  It says, his efforts contributed much to the maintenance of public confidence in what happened at Pearl Harbor.
[01:46:47.124 --> 01:46:47.604]  Oh yes!
[01:46:48.685 --> 01:46:49.305]  How wonderful!
[01:46:49.506 --> 01:47:00.574]  And by the way, in case there were any of these claims that there were communists in the Pentagon and in the White House, you know, such as McCarthy had, they were ready for this.
[01:47:00.894 --> 01:47:05.238]  This guy, Clawson, the head of the Masons, was, listen to this,
[01:47:06.645 --> 01:47:18.392]  He was appointed as Staff Judge Advocate to the Office of the Prosecutor in important court-martial cases, and he was on the Special Presidential Appeal Board for spy trials.
[01:47:19.472 --> 01:47:20.793]  You're accused of being a spy?
[01:47:21.133 --> 01:47:21.834]  Don't worry!
[01:47:21.854 --> 01:47:24.455]  Old Brother Clausen will take care of it!
[01:47:26.276 --> 01:47:28.457]  So everything is cooked by these people.
[01:47:29.318 --> 01:47:30.818]  And this is just an example.
[01:47:30.878 --> 01:47:33.000]  So, was Pearl Harbor a lie?
[01:47:33.060 --> 01:47:33.460]  Of course!
[01:47:34.164 --> 01:47:36.965]  Roosevelt knew they wanted to get us into World War II.
[01:47:37.585 --> 01:47:39.686]  They knew what the Japanese were going to do.
[01:47:39.746 --> 01:47:45.308]  They knew that Berlin, Germany, had a pact with Japan.
[01:47:45.328 --> 01:47:49.769]  And when we declared war on Japan, we were also declaring war on Germany.
[01:47:50.089 --> 01:47:51.149]  This is what they wanted.
[01:47:51.710 --> 01:47:52.630]  The Druid witch!
[01:47:53.556 --> 01:48:10.466]  A pagan priest over in Great Britain, Wynton Churchill, working with the pagan priest of America, FDR, the Freemason, who put the all-seeing eye, and they had old brother Clawson there all ready to go as a staff judge advocate, the personal appointee of the Secretary of War.
[01:48:10.486 --> 01:48:16.510]  And look at how he joins the army and goes right to the top at thousands of times the speed of anybody else.
[01:48:16.590 --> 01:48:20.252]  It's all predestined with these individuals.
[01:48:21.898 --> 01:48:24.679]  Tex, what do they think about our work, from all your years of study?
[01:48:24.719 --> 01:48:31.523]  I mean, I know they're mad at us, I know they've persecuted you, persecuted me, but all that's a blessing, but what do these elites think of us?
[01:48:32.883 --> 01:48:34.604]  I believe they're very worried about us.
[01:48:34.844 --> 01:48:35.985]  I believe they're very concerned.
[01:48:36.025 --> 01:48:40.767]  Just like Lenin said, we cannot allow words against the government.
[01:48:40.787 --> 01:48:47.431]  Remember, Bush even went to the United Nations and said we can't allow these conspiracy theories.
[01:48:47.731 --> 01:48:49.472]  I'm paraphrasing, but you remember it exactly.
[01:48:49.492 --> 01:48:50.252]  Well, that's what he said.
[01:48:50.845 --> 01:48:52.306]  No, we can't allow these things.
[01:48:53.567 --> 01:48:59.593]  And the gal, you know, who was the spokesperson, from Austin, Texas, by the way, I'm sorry, I forget her name now.
[01:49:00.053 --> 01:49:05.338]  She was sent over to the State Department to develop a special office, I call it the Office of Disinformation.
[01:49:05.558 --> 01:49:06.138]  The OD.
[01:49:06.158 --> 01:49:07.980]  The OD of that office.
[01:49:09.032 --> 01:49:13.293]  To try to create news items and news stories, trying to blast people like Alex Jones.
[01:49:13.333 --> 01:49:15.774]  And by the way, let me just add this caveat before I forget it.
[01:49:16.814 --> 01:49:22.576]  One of the things she said is we're liars, you know, Renz is a liar, everybody's evil, there's no 9-11.
[01:49:22.996 --> 01:49:26.457]  But they also said China doesn't take political dissidents' organs.
[01:49:27.077 --> 01:49:28.137]  There was a problem, though.
[01:49:28.557 --> 01:49:31.338]  The State Department, five years before, had done a big paper on it.
[01:49:31.818 --> 01:49:35.719]  So she was even shilling just... Stay there, Tex, I want to hear what you think about
[01:49:36.511 --> 01:49:42.033]  Then we're going to go to Ron Nelson and a couple other callers for Tex Mars.
[01:49:42.414 --> 01:49:47.996]  And we've got Michael Rivero coming up as well in the third hour, so stay with us.
[01:49:56.875 --> 01:50:02.385]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.745 --> 01:50:10.398]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.078 --> 01:50:18.121]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.541 --> 01:50:29.966]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.266 --> 01:50:33.728]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.228 --> 01:50:36.189]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.489 --> 01:50:40.271]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:59.953 --> 01:52:03.076]  Citizens create their own videos about him.
[01:52:03.456 --> 01:52:06.940]  Hi Internet, my name is Rachel and I'm a Ron Paul junkie.
[01:52:06.980 --> 01:52:09.582]  They chant his name in the streets.
[01:52:09.962 --> 01:52:11.344]  Ron Paul for President!
[01:52:11.484 --> 01:52:26.077]  The man so loved by the people that he has sparked an electoral American revolution has now inspired a radio program dedicated to his campaign for the presidency of the United States.
[01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:38.637]  I'm Stephen Vincent, and I host Ron Paul Radio on GCN, Mondays through Fridays, from 3 to 4 Pacific, 5 to 6 Central, and 6 to 7 Eastern.
[01:52:38.958 --> 01:52:42.680]  Ron Paul Radio is the live voice of the freedom message.

[01:52:59.050 --> 01:53:01.771]  Ron, Nelson, Jenny, Aaron,
[01:53:18.451 --> 01:53:19.873]  Johnny, Richard, so many of you.
[01:53:19.893 --> 01:53:24.460]  We're going to get to you here in just a minute or two and hold Tex about 15 over in the next hour if he can do that.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:26.323]  I need to ask him if he can do that.
[01:53:26.623 --> 01:53:27.805]  I keep forgetting during the breaks.
[01:53:28.125 --> 01:53:29.828]  Tex, can you hold over a little bit for the next hour?
[01:53:30.268 --> 01:53:31.089]  I sure can, Alex.
[01:53:31.150 --> 01:53:32.632]  I'm having a good time exposing you.
[01:53:33.596 --> 01:53:41.138]  You know, I've always been thrilled by it, and I'm certainly no saint, but I like to do good.
[01:53:41.158 --> 01:53:42.499]  I have a conscience.
[01:53:42.679 --> 01:53:44.679]  I feel bad when I do things that are bad.
[01:53:44.699 --> 01:53:50.341]  I always liked standing up to bullies.
[01:53:50.401 --> 01:53:53.742]  It's so alien, these people that revel in hurting innocents.
[01:53:53.822 --> 01:53:58.143]  They revel in lining people up and blowing their heads off.
[01:53:58.860 --> 01:54:24.669]  I'd like to like the serial killer up in Missouri, who was the cop and the public official, who enjoyed... And so many times we see that, and when I was asking you about what do the elite think of us, by that I don't mean that as some idiosyncratic, I want to hear about us, but I'm curious, what do they think about our movement from your research?
[01:54:25.725 --> 01:54:30.969]  You know, first of all, remember they have been dismantling the Constitution one piece at a time.
[01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:39.275]  They don't control all the judges, 95%, but that 5% must really stymie, must really anger and baffle them.
[01:54:39.795 --> 01:54:40.796]  The same thing with us.
[01:54:40.916 --> 01:54:42.977]  We have at least some vestiges left.
[01:54:43.477 --> 01:54:48.701]  We really need to grab hold of those things and swing with them like Tarzan, you know, from tree to tree.
[01:54:49.061 --> 01:54:51.643]  There's very little cable or rope left there.
[01:54:52.267 --> 01:55:09.497]  But, uh, I am convinced, I know from my own standpoint, you know, we had the Internal Revenue Service, uh, four years, actually, uh, audit me, uh, in the ministry, and then they turned around and audit me personally for four years.
[01:55:09.897 --> 01:55:18.722]  So, you know, and by the way, the IRS agent admitted that it was a find, it was not something at random, just a computer spit out.
[01:55:19.651 --> 01:55:21.393]  Uh, and he must have been a very high-level guy.
[01:55:21.413 --> 01:55:23.234]  The guy drove a fancy sports car.
[01:55:23.975 --> 01:55:25.977]  And wore a really expensive suit.
[01:55:26.017 --> 01:55:27.958]  That's the IRS agent they sent over here.
[01:55:28.399 --> 01:55:29.800]  Now, they didn't find anything.
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:35.985]  They sort of wasted their time, but it cost me tens of thousands of dollars to find this.
[01:55:36.025 --> 01:55:38.527]  We finally took them to court, and they finally dropped the law.
[01:55:38.547 --> 01:55:41.690]  Well, not to mention your time, and I remember that really tied you up.
[01:55:42.471 --> 01:55:43.592]  It really did, you know.
[01:55:43.772 --> 01:55:45.934]  And of course, these people talk about bullies.
[01:55:46.074 --> 01:55:47.095]  They are just bullies.
[01:55:48.494 --> 01:55:55.619]  But this is what you... Well, you wrote that book about Hillary, Big Sisters, watching you, and it's admitted that they assigned tens of thousands to be audited.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:55:57.801]  Oh, I'll tell you, absolutely.
[01:55:57.821 --> 01:56:03.886]  I remember talking to the Rutherford Institute, and they told me that my telephone was tapped.
[01:56:04.307 --> 01:56:05.307]  But here's the whole point.
[01:56:05.768 --> 01:56:07.249]  Our lives must be visible.
[01:56:07.589 --> 01:56:12.093]  If you're going to fight Big Brother's evil, your life must be invisible.
[01:56:13.019 --> 01:56:15.079]  Again, you mentioned that we're not perfect.
[01:56:15.099 --> 01:56:16.280]  Of course we're not.
[01:56:16.620 --> 01:56:17.760]  We don't claim to be.
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:23.921]  You know, one of the things I really like what you said, that you can't stand bullies, you always fought against bullies.
[01:56:24.801 --> 01:56:26.041]  That's always been me.
[01:56:26.061 --> 01:56:33.083]  You know, I'm not a real courageous guy, but I remember way back in the seventh grade, they had a guy that everybody was picking on.
[01:56:34.143 --> 01:56:36.023]  And finally, I just couldn't take it anymore.
[01:56:36.043 --> 01:56:40.704]  We were out during recess or whatever, and they had about a hundred guys there, it seemed like, picking on him.
[01:56:41.472 --> 01:56:46.734]  Especially a couple bullies that I just walked up, and at the back of my mind I thought, oh boy, I'm in for it now.
[01:56:46.954 --> 01:56:48.055]  Now they're going to beat me up.
[01:56:48.555 --> 01:56:52.516]  But I couldn't take it anymore, and I went up there and I said, why don't you quit picking on this guy?
[01:56:52.896 --> 01:56:54.157]  Pick on me instead.
[01:56:54.437 --> 01:56:56.138]  Now some people say, Tex, you were really brave.
[01:56:56.178 --> 01:56:57.078]  No, I was scared!
[01:56:59.059 --> 01:57:01.260]  But I did it, and you don't want the bullies back down!
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:07.002]  Well, it's a survival instinct for the tribe to stand up against oppressors.
[01:57:07.542 --> 01:57:09.743]  You see a bunch of scum, you can't help it.
[01:57:10.399 --> 01:57:10.880]  That's right.
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:15.003]  And I believe that most people know these things are true, but they're frightened.
[01:57:15.043 --> 01:57:17.846]  But your audience, praise God, are courageous.
[01:57:17.906 --> 01:57:18.286]  They are.
[01:57:18.306 --> 01:57:19.547]  No, they are.
[01:57:19.707 --> 01:57:21.028]  And it's simple.
[01:57:21.148 --> 01:57:25.832]  I mean, growing up, it was a lot of rough stuff when I grew up in Dallas.
[01:57:25.892 --> 01:57:28.154]  I mean, people fought like demons up there.
[01:57:28.194 --> 01:57:31.738]  And I learned real quick, it's just best to go ahead and get it over with.

[01:58:08.329 --> 01:58:13.774]  Already into the third and final hour, just a few minutes left, five minutes, then a couple minutes after the break we'll text Mars.
[01:58:14.274 --> 01:58:16.236]  Let's go to calls for texts.
[01:58:17.328 --> 01:58:19.710]  Let's talk to Tom in New York.
[01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:20.350]  You're on the air.
[01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:21.011]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:58:24.813 --> 01:58:25.373]  Oh, okay.
[01:58:25.413 --> 01:58:27.275]  Then we'll go to Ron in New York next.
[01:58:27.975 --> 01:58:28.816]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:58:28.856 --> 01:58:29.256]  Go ahead.
[01:58:29.276 --> 01:58:29.916]  Hi.
[01:58:30.437 --> 01:58:36.541]  My topic may not exactly be on point completely with what Tex is talking about, but I want to raise an issue.
[01:58:36.641 --> 01:58:38.062]  Ron, you haven't called in about a year.
[01:58:38.102 --> 01:58:38.822]  Good to hear from you.
[01:58:39.203 --> 01:58:39.583]  Thank you.
[01:58:39.603 --> 01:58:40.383]  Thank you very much.
[01:58:40.403 --> 01:58:43.185]  It's tougher to get through to your show now as you get more popular.
[01:58:43.225 --> 01:58:44.326]  Harder and harder and harder.
[01:58:44.746 --> 01:58:45.787]  But I finally made it today.
[01:58:46.893 --> 01:58:57.097]  The topic I'm going to discuss today is in regards to a bill which was formally titled prior to last Thursday, H.R.
[01:58:57.117 --> 01:59:01.919]  2640, which is an expansion of the National Incident Check System in order to purchase firearms.
[01:59:02.518 --> 01:59:04.220]  Which federalizes the departments.
[01:59:04.300 --> 01:59:06.622]  It's the biggest gun control act since 1968.
[01:59:06.942 --> 01:59:10.025]  The NRA supported it, and the average person has no idea.
[01:59:10.285 --> 01:59:17.111]  The BATF, coast to coast, and I've even had NRA board members on to talk about this, is shutting down gun shops everywhere.
[01:59:17.151 --> 01:59:19.092]  There is a reign of anti-gun terror.
[01:59:19.312 --> 01:59:21.715]  Let me get Tex to comment on that.
[01:59:21.855 --> 01:59:23.216]  Tex, you want to comment on what's happening?
[01:59:23.936 --> 01:59:25.217]  Well, I'm glad Ron brought this up.
[01:59:25.257 --> 01:59:26.318]  This is all part of it.
[01:59:26.998 --> 01:59:33.922]  But remember, the Republican Party and George Bush masquerade as defenders of the Second Amendment.
[01:59:33.982 --> 01:59:37.604]  Here again we have what the truth is versus the lie.
[01:59:38.205 --> 01:59:50.692]  So, they have their thugs, you know, at the ATF, the Treasury Department, going around harassing gun shops and such.
[01:59:51.797 --> 01:59:56.179]  At the same time, they're going down and Dick Cheney's shooting somebody in the face.
[01:59:56.940 --> 01:59:58.500]  Maybe we should take away his guns.
[01:59:58.941 --> 02:00:05.884]  But then we leave good American citizens with something to defend ourselves against, the tyrants in Washington, D.C.
[02:00:05.964 --> 02:00:09.726]  Now Ron's a former New York, he's a retired police officer.
[02:00:09.926 --> 02:00:11.027]  You want to comment on this, Ron?
[02:00:11.047 --> 02:00:11.407]  Go ahead.
[02:00:11.747 --> 02:00:12.647]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:00:13.048 --> 02:00:16.529]  It's even worse than people know, and they have played this so cleverly.
[02:00:16.589 --> 02:00:17.710]  They have played this one
[02:00:18.170 --> 02:00:20.552]  Like a black widow playing each strand of its webs.
[02:00:20.732 --> 02:00:23.834]  It's almost diabolical cunning has been used to promote this.
[02:00:24.335 --> 02:00:26.416]  It is no longer called H.R.
[02:00:26.436 --> 02:00:28.238]  2640, by the way, because in the U.S.
[02:00:28.258 --> 02:00:30.599]  Senate Committee last Thursday, U.S.
[02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:35.483]  Senate Judiciary Committee, it was merged with several other unrelated bills.
[02:00:35.953 --> 02:00:36.994]  And they've retitled it.
[02:00:37.254 --> 02:00:40.497]  See, they keep metamorphosizing the bill every time people get a little wild.
[02:00:40.517 --> 02:00:41.117]  Now, wait a minute.
[02:00:41.177 --> 02:00:45.380]  Bush signed an instant check expansion.
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:46.581]  You mean there's another one?
[02:00:46.962 --> 02:00:47.602]  Yes, yep.
[02:00:48.183 --> 02:00:49.444]  Oh my, when does it end?
[02:00:49.504 --> 02:00:50.464]  I can't even keep track.
[02:00:50.565 --> 02:00:52.426]  Hold on, hold on, my friend.
[02:00:52.486 --> 02:00:53.627]  Please, this is unbelievable.
[02:00:53.667 --> 02:00:54.267]  Here's what's happening.
[02:00:54.287 --> 02:00:56.749]  I'm going to put you on hold because Mike Rivera will want to talk about this.
[02:00:57.010 --> 02:00:57.730]  Ron, can you hold this?
[02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:58.511]  I want to give you some time.
[02:00:58.551 --> 02:01:01.493]  Oh, it's absolutely important that I hold and let the country know what you're listening to.
[02:01:02.714 --> 02:01:04.555]  And I want to skip to another caller, I don't want people to have a chance.
[02:01:04.976 --> 02:01:07.678]  Nelson just hung up, so let's go to Jenny in Arizona.
[02:01:07.738 --> 02:01:09.099]  Jenny, you're on the air with Tex Mars.
[02:01:09.539 --> 02:01:10.780]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:11.540 --> 02:01:15.583]  First time caller, so I'm a little nervous, so if you could bear with me a little bit.
[02:01:16.063 --> 02:01:20.807]  First I wanted to say that I wanted to ask if you've ever read a book called A Choice, Not an Echo.
[02:01:21.533 --> 02:01:23.674]  Written by Phyllis Shafley, I believe.
[02:01:23.694 --> 02:01:25.034]  Phyllis Shafley.
[02:01:25.294 --> 02:01:26.035]  I've read the book.
[02:01:26.055 --> 02:01:26.595]  I've interviewed her.
[02:01:27.035 --> 02:01:29.436]  Okay, because my mom always talked about this book.
[02:01:29.476 --> 02:01:32.777]  She said her father used to always talk about it, and so I got it off eBay.
[02:01:32.797 --> 02:01:37.798]  I actually got you a copy, too, so I didn't know if you'd seen it or read it, but it's amazing.
[02:01:37.838 --> 02:01:38.839]  It was written back in the 60s.
[02:01:38.919 --> 02:01:45.081]  It talks all about... She refers to the New World Order as Kingmakers, and she talks about how
[02:01:46.488 --> 02:01:57.593]  She mentions the Bilderbergs and how she mentions possible meeting dates, and I cross-referenced the meeting dates of the Bilderberg meetings that she was discussing, and sure enough it was definite Bilderberg that she was talking about.
[02:01:58.173 --> 02:02:03.855]  And she mentioned David Rockefeller in there, George Romney, the governor of Michigan at the time, father of Mitt Romney.
[02:02:04.115 --> 02:02:05.156]  Oh yeah, total scum.
[02:02:05.576 --> 02:02:13.159]  It was just amazing how she was mentioning how they had the Kingmakers put in Romney to go up against Goldwater.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:16.863]  Because they did not want Goldwater in there no matter what.
[02:02:16.903 --> 02:02:19.405]  And they're running Romney against Paul right now.
[02:02:19.685 --> 02:02:23.229]  Let me get Tex Mars comment on that quickly on the other side.
[02:02:24.390 --> 02:02:26.872]  And then we're going to wrap it up with our guest.
[02:02:26.912 --> 02:02:28.914]  Got to get him back up in the near future.
[02:02:29.314 --> 02:02:32.637]  Final segment with Tex Mars on the other side.
[02:02:32.738 --> 02:02:35.460]  PowerofProphecy.com is the website.
[02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:39.264]  You can link through to it right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:02:46.770 --> 02:02:55.852]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:02:56.093 --> 02:03:07.316]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:03:07.656 --> 02:03:12.477]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[02:03:12.717 --> 02:03:12.857]  I think?
[02:03:31.493 --> 02:03:31.974]  Let's get it!
[02:03:48.835 --> 02:03:54.277]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.638 --> 02:04:02.261]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.972 --> 02:04:10.036]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.436 --> 02:04:21.862]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:22.162 --> 02:04:25.864]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:26.125 --> 02:04:28.066]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.386 --> 02:04:32.248]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:45.473 --> 02:04:52.955]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.

[02:05:11.640 --> 02:05:12.421]  What does this all mean?
[02:05:12.681 --> 02:05:17.044]  Well, this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy, and helps you look younger.
[02:05:17.324 --> 02:05:26.469]  Night Skin is real, and the results are real, and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin, and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.

[02:05:34.955 --> 02:05:35.175]  Call 1-800-894-3462.
[02:05:35.195 --> 02:05:35.475]  That's 1-800-894-3462.
[02:05:35.515 --> 02:05:38.538]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:38.578 --> 02:05:39.839]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:39.859 --> 02:05:40.659]  We are in occupied territory.
[02:06:01.494 --> 02:06:04.477]  I've been running that liner now for 10 years, 9 years.
[02:06:06.018 --> 02:06:07.880]  I don't know if it's 98, 9 years.
[02:06:10.482 --> 02:06:11.903]  And that's what we're facing here.
[02:06:13.284 --> 02:06:14.826]  We are in occupied territory.
[02:06:15.286 --> 02:06:19.710]  Physically, financially, spiritually, geographically.
[02:06:20.190 --> 02:06:27.977]  We need to realize that it is a literal hoax, a fraud, a matrix of propaganda that is then regurgitated by the general public.
[02:06:28.693 --> 02:06:32.334]  And going back to Jenny, and then we're going to finish up with Johnny, and that's going to be it.
[02:06:32.595 --> 02:06:33.735]  We're going to let Tex go.
[02:06:35.136 --> 02:06:35.976]  Johnny in Virginia.
[02:06:36.196 --> 02:06:37.316]  Tex, that's exactly what we're talking about.
[02:06:37.336 --> 02:06:49.441]  These lies, and how it's generational, and how Mitt Romney, you know, she found stuff written back in the 60s about how his daddy was used to hamstring Goldwater, who was a Ron Paul, you know, prototype.
[02:06:50.981 --> 02:06:52.542]  That's exactly what you were talking about earlier.
[02:06:52.582 --> 02:06:54.703]  These key people in key positions, and you can see
[02:06:56.349 --> 02:07:06.575]  We've got a video on PrisonPlanet.com today where it shows ABC photos on ABC's website and shows one Ron Paul person with a sign that says, oh, there were many more Mitt Romney.
[02:07:06.875 --> 02:07:08.916]  Then it shows actual video of those very people.
[02:07:09.317 --> 02:07:14.039]  There are hundreds of Ron Paul people and just a few Mitt Romneys they misrepresent.
[02:07:14.079 --> 02:07:15.220]  Again, it's a lie.
[02:07:16.345 --> 02:07:16.846]  Right there.
[02:07:17.326 --> 02:07:19.548]  So, comments to what Jenny was saying, Tex?
[02:07:20.288 --> 02:07:38.523]  Well, and you know, I can understand why they did, and why Schlafly was correct in her book, A Choice, Not an Echo, because Goldwater wrote his autobiography and he warned people about the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission a little later on.
[02:07:38.823 --> 02:07:41.225]  But he said the CFR is basically a group that
[02:07:41.916 --> 02:07:47.778]  Of influential men who want a new world order, a one world system to end American sovereignty.
[02:07:48.119 --> 02:07:49.499]  So they didn't want Goldwater in there.
[02:07:49.519 --> 02:07:52.560]  And you remember the incredible propaganda they used about him.
[02:07:53.001 --> 02:08:03.665]  They had a little girl in a political ad showing a little girl picking daisies in a beautiful field of daisy flowers and suddenly a new mushroom cloud.
[02:08:04.285 --> 02:08:06.606]  And of course, Mr. Condi Rice,
[02:08:07.222 --> 02:08:11.245]  When people doubted that there were weapons of mass destruction, Alex, what did she bring forth?
[02:08:11.265 --> 02:08:13.526]  She said, we don't want to see a mushroom cloud.
[02:08:13.866 --> 02:08:15.147]  The mushroom cloud!
[02:08:15.607 --> 02:08:17.148]  Boy, I'll always remember that mushroom.
[02:08:17.849 --> 02:08:27.815]  You know, one of the things I was just thinking during the break, and I'd like to just very quickly read, because I think your video documentary, Terror Storm,
[02:08:28.959 --> 02:08:30.160]  Boy, it epitomizes.
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:37.087]  Going back to Phyllis Schlafly and that book in the 60s, this is the book written in 48, by George Orwell, or published in 48, 1984.
[02:08:38.028 --> 02:08:42.973]  And I'd like your comment, Alex, on this.
[02:08:43.053 --> 02:08:46.897]  It talks on page 153 here of the edition I have of George Orwell's 1984.
[02:08:48.365 --> 02:08:57.471]  Remember, the main character, Winston, had a girlfriend named Julia, and she believed that most of the nonsense being put out by the government was a bunch of lies.
[02:08:57.931 --> 02:09:01.494]  Now listen to this quote, and see, I want to know what you think it says.
[02:09:02.014 --> 02:09:09.999]  In some ways, she, that is Julia, was far more acute than Winston and far less susceptible to propaganda.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:10.940]  Once,
[02:09:11.485 --> 02:09:22.515]  When he happened in some connection to mention the war against Eurasia, she startled him by saying casually that, in her opinion, the war was not happening.
[02:09:23.155 --> 02:09:32.924]  The rocket bombs, which fell daily on London, were probably fired by the government itself, just to keep people frightened.
[02:09:33.685 --> 02:09:38.409]  This was an idea that literally had never occurred to him.
[02:09:39.953 --> 02:09:45.117]  And then later he's walking and he notices it never hits government compounds, it just hits the general public.
[02:09:45.578 --> 02:09:47.700]  No, exactly, that's government-sponsored terror.
[02:09:47.820 --> 02:09:51.843]  And you see, Orwell had worked in the secret police in India growing up there.
[02:09:52.263 --> 02:09:56.867]  Then he decided to be a bum for years and to experience it very highly educated, very smart.
[02:09:57.127 --> 02:09:58.168]  Eric Blair was his real name.
[02:09:58.548 --> 02:09:59.990]  Then he fought for the communists.
[02:10:00.030 --> 02:10:02.692]  He found out then they were controlled in Franco-Spain.
[02:10:02.712 --> 02:10:03.773]  He got shot through the throat.
[02:10:04.694 --> 02:10:21.307]  Then he went back and worked for the BBC in propaganda and in that book he figures out, of course then it was known in England that the Milner Group, as Carol Quigley wrote, actually knew Hitler was going to do what he did and financed him so he would, and they knew this in the 30s, would tear everything up so they could bring down Europe.
[02:10:22.468 --> 02:10:27.052]  So Orwell knew all that and that's why the book is so genius because he lays out a lot of their systems.
[02:10:27.553 --> 02:10:31.276]  Anything else you want to add, Jenny, from Arizona?
[02:10:31.736 --> 02:10:44.519]  Yeah, just real quick, there was one other point I wanted to make about, I was reading the Costco magazine this month that I get, and on page 43 it's titled, Meet the Board, and to my surprise, the director since 2003 is William H. Gates, the father of Bill Gates.
[02:10:45.119 --> 02:10:50.340]  So I thought that pretty ridiculous, considering he's a big population thinning advocate, and Costco's all about bulk.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.040]  He's on the board of what?
[02:10:52.700 --> 02:10:54.101]  On the board of Costco.
[02:10:54.881 --> 02:11:00.022]  Oh yeah, well he's also on the board of Planned Parenthood, and Bill Gates is a huge eugenicist.
[02:11:02.500 --> 02:11:03.299]  You look like pure evil.
[02:11:04.505 --> 02:11:06.466]  Well, it's hard to find photos of him.
[02:11:07.426 --> 02:11:09.307]  That ended up on the cutting room floor in Endgame.
[02:11:09.347 --> 02:11:14.430]  We just don't have time to put that in and add all the evidence of how wicked Bill Gates and his daddy are, but thank you.
[02:11:14.450 --> 02:11:21.613]  And listen, I haven't read a choice on an Echo in years, and so if you bought an extra copy, give it to friends or family, or if you're not going to, sure, send it.
[02:11:21.633 --> 02:11:24.174]  It'd be good to have in the library.
[02:11:24.254 --> 02:11:25.495]  I really appreciate your call, Jenny.
[02:11:25.815 --> 02:11:30.857]  One last call, and we're going to go to Mike Rivera, and I appreciate Tex joining us today, and I appreciate Mike coming on.
[02:11:31.497 --> 02:11:32.658]  Johnny in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:11:33.601 --> 02:11:34.541]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:11:34.661 --> 02:11:52.908]  Text, I was wondering if, being that we're all familiar with unconstitutional behavior of government and so forth, if the people were Constitution-minded, and you were charged and arrested and went before a jury of your peers for violating a law that is unconstitutional, would you be convicted?
[02:11:52.928 --> 02:11:56.629]  And second part is, if the people were Constitution-minded,
[02:11:57.099 --> 02:12:01.240]  Wouldn't that turn government completely around, starting at the state level?
[02:12:01.300 --> 02:12:02.461]  Let me just throw something in.
[02:12:03.061 --> 02:12:05.202]  That question is directly for Tex, isn't it?
[02:12:05.342 --> 02:12:05.462]  Yes.
[02:12:05.482 --> 02:12:08.623]  Tex, go ahead.
[02:12:09.083 --> 02:12:10.583]  I'm breaking my habit of interrupting.
[02:12:10.663 --> 02:12:11.744]  It's not a show-off thing.
[02:12:11.804 --> 02:12:16.925]  It's that I get real hyper and then I... Well, I think it's conviction.
[02:12:17.005 --> 02:12:18.846]  It's passion for the truth here.
[02:12:19.768 --> 02:12:22.810]  Well, you know, if I understand the question correct, of course.
[02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:24.811]  You know, people are being convicted.
[02:12:24.851 --> 02:12:26.512]  Look at the two Border Patrol agents.
[02:12:26.892 --> 02:12:29.053]  Because the government brings in lies.
[02:12:29.754 --> 02:12:35.417]  And they use propaganda, as they did in the trial of the Koresh people.
[02:12:36.804 --> 02:12:42.186]  And the judge also instructs the jury on what they've got to do, which he's not supposed to do.
[02:12:42.206 --> 02:12:46.907]  You're supposed to judge the facts and the law, and the jury's the boss, and they even instruct the judge.
[02:12:46.927 --> 02:12:50.409]  Now they've incrementally changed that culture to a fraud.
[02:12:51.249 --> 02:13:00.532]  But expanding on that, the American Bar Association, the last seven years running, their number one thing they call for whenever they meet, generally in Newark or Chicago, is to abolish trial by jury.
[02:13:01.472 --> 02:13:06.973]  So the lawyers themselves, the Guild, are arguing to abolish it, Tex?
[02:13:08.233 --> 02:13:15.515]  They would like that because, you know, they don't want any way that the people can be involved in making judgments and decisions.
[02:13:16.855 --> 02:13:21.516]  But again here, you know, the Constitution has been destroyed piece by piece.
[02:13:21.956 --> 02:13:23.396]  And I want people to remember something.
[02:13:23.616 --> 02:13:26.597]  Our original Constitution did not have a Bill of Rights.
[02:13:27.317 --> 02:13:28.037]  The elite
[02:13:29.006 --> 02:13:39.033]  Even who gave us our Constitution did not include a Bill of Rights, but the people of the United States, the little people, you can call them that if you want to, I like being called a little person.
[02:13:39.053 --> 02:13:39.894]  1789, they demanded it.
[02:13:39.974 --> 02:13:40.594]  That's right.
[02:13:40.674 --> 02:13:45.637]  They said, we're not going to approve this Constitution unless you add ten amendments.
[02:13:46.918 --> 02:13:48.860]  And so, this is very vital for us.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:52.222]  It's not what our founding fathers gave to us.
[02:13:53.354 --> 02:13:58.295]  It's what the people of America demanded and said you're not going to take away from us.
[02:13:58.995 --> 02:13:59.615]  Absolutely.
[02:13:59.915 --> 02:14:01.296]  Thank you for the call, Johnny.
[02:14:01.736 --> 02:14:11.738]  Tex, I know you've been really busy and we're always praying for your ministry and the great work you do, but I'd like to twist your arm to come back on at least once a month with us because we're always so blessed to have you.
[02:14:11.778 --> 02:14:13.978]  Give out the toll-free number to get that free newsletter.
[02:14:14.719 --> 02:14:21.040]  AlexPowerProphecy.com, of course, and InfoWars.com for the book Codex Magicka, but just call us toll-free 1-800
[02:14:22.230 --> 02:14:26.893]  2-3-4-9-6-7-3 and simply say, please send me the newsletter.
[02:14:27.314 --> 02:14:29.595]  Give your address and we'll send it right out to you.
[02:14:29.695 --> 02:14:30.556]  Tell them again please, sir.
[02:14:31.016 --> 02:14:31.196]  Yeah, 1-800...
[02:14:32.847 --> 02:14:34.488]  That's toll free.
[02:14:34.508 --> 02:14:35.149]  2-3-4-9-6-7-3.
[02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:43.254]  Tex, say hi to everybody there at the office, and Wanda, and Mickey, and everybody else, and God bless you, my friend.
[02:14:43.534 --> 02:14:46.536]  Hey, it's been a great pleasure, and God bless you and your wonderful audience, Alex.
[02:14:46.676 --> 02:14:46.996]  You bet.
[02:14:47.036 --> 02:14:48.237]  He is just such a sweetheart.
[02:14:48.277 --> 02:14:50.618]  He's such a dear sweetheart, and his wife is so great.
[02:14:50.638 --> 02:14:51.859]  And, you know, I'm so busy.
[02:14:51.959 --> 02:14:55.582]  I used to go out to dinner every once in a while with Tex, and go over to his house and stuff.
[02:14:56.262 --> 02:14:59.204]  Years ago, I don't know, I haven't seen Tex personally in three years.
[02:14:59.724 --> 02:15:00.765]  He's never even met my daughter.
[02:15:04.355 --> 02:15:09.603]  I'm not whining, that's the type of stuff I've sacrificed, is that I never get to see people anymore.
[02:15:09.643 --> 02:15:10.144]  And you know what?
[02:15:10.184 --> 02:15:13.850]  Speaking of sacrifice, I appreciate Michael Rivero sitting there for the last five minutes.
[02:15:14.370 --> 02:15:15.312]  I got text on late.
[02:15:16.192 --> 02:15:17.833]  And then, so I've got him on late.
[02:15:17.973 --> 02:15:18.893]  He joins us once a month.
[02:15:18.953 --> 02:15:23.594]  It's his own great show, Saturday mornings for two hours here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:15:23.894 --> 02:15:30.596]  It's another syndicated show now, and I'm glad that I twisted his arm into getting into radio because he's got a lot of talent and a great political mind.
[02:15:30.836 --> 02:15:35.738]  WhatReallyHappened.com is the website, and we always love to pick his brain once a month.
[02:15:36.098 --> 02:15:36.878]  We'll be taking your calls.
[02:15:36.898 --> 02:15:38.179]  Come up in about 20 minutes for him.
[02:15:38.199 --> 02:15:39.879]  We've got some calls on gun control and other issues.
[02:15:40.259 --> 02:15:42.320]  But Mike Rivero, always good to have you on, my friend.
[02:15:42.938 --> 02:15:48.719]  Well, always good to be on your show, Alex, and I didn't mind waiting because I like to listen to Tex talk about what he talks about, too.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:50.040]  He's a very interesting fellow.
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:53.281]  A very cheerful individual, as well.
[02:15:53.321 --> 02:15:54.341]  Always makes you happy to talk to him.
[02:15:55.061 --> 02:15:57.682]  Mike, we never talk before you come on air.
[02:15:57.862 --> 02:15:59.542]  What do you think is most important right now?
[02:15:59.582 --> 02:16:01.663]  Give us a prelude, and we'll come back and get into it.
[02:16:02.343 --> 02:16:11.345]  Well, I think right now what is becoming obvious is that Ron Paul's candidacy is really gaining a lot of steam, and I think the mainstream media and the establishment
[02:16:11.764 --> 02:16:21.932]  Are transitioning away from simply saying he's irrelevant to attempting to recast him on issues away from the war.
[02:16:21.952 --> 02:16:33.220]  And whether or not Ron Paul can actually win the White House or not, the reality is that as long as he remains a viable candidate, he is going to make the wars a major issue of the 2008 campaign.
[02:16:33.341 --> 02:16:34.902]  And he's going to inject real issues.
[02:16:35.924 --> 02:16:37.328]  Absolutely, that will be the case.
[02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:41.922]  And the last thing that any of the other candidates want is for the war to be an issue at all.
[02:16:42.452 --> 02:16:52.081]  And the sooner they can get rid of him, the sooner they can go on trying to make global warming, or gay marriage, or immigration, or all these other things... The diversionary football!
[02:16:52.261 --> 02:16:52.742]  Oh, perfect!
[02:16:52.782 --> 02:16:53.322]  I'm glad!
[02:16:53.582 --> 02:16:56.805]  I meant to talk about that this morning when I saw all the hit pieces on Paul.
[02:16:57.065 --> 02:16:59.147]  Then I kind of forgot it in the wash, you know, on air.
[02:16:59.207 --> 02:17:00.809]  You know, with all this other stuff floating around.
[02:17:01.109 --> 02:17:06.194]  But that's in my stack here, you know, where they're going, he did spit millions for shrimp research!
[02:17:06.574 --> 02:17:18.537]  The earmark had been spent, it was being apportioned to his district, and he said, OK, since I've got to have the money, I'll try the private industry for research on how to get shrimp in the Gulf, because there's literally hardly any.
[02:17:18.557 --> 02:17:21.058]  I mean, when I was a kid, there were hundreds of shrimp boats at every port.
[02:17:21.078 --> 02:17:21.798]  Now there's none.
[02:17:22.178 --> 02:17:24.979]  He tries to get shrimp back in the ocean, and now he's evil.
[02:17:24.999 --> 02:17:26.299]  They're saying, oh, he's pork barrel.
[02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:27.740]  Stay there, Mike Rivera.
[02:17:27.920 --> 02:17:28.480]  We'll come back.
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.321]  And, man, I'm glad you brought that up.
[02:17:30.361 --> 02:17:32.541]  We'll talk about Ron Paul on the other side.
[02:17:32.561 --> 02:17:35.502]  I'm glad he mentioned that, because I'd totally forgotten about it.
[02:17:36.163 --> 02:17:39.087]  And we've got a story on prisonpanda.com is our top story up there about this.
[02:17:39.548 --> 02:17:41.351]  So Mike always brings up the key issues.
[02:17:41.391 --> 02:17:42.393]  We'll talk to him on the other side.
[02:17:42.613 --> 02:17:43.515]  WhatReallyHappened.com
[02:17:46.195 --> 02:17:51.419]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:17:51.559 --> 02:17:59.665]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:17:59.905 --> 02:18:06.970]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:08.431]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:18:08.511 --> 02:18:14.396]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:18:14.596 --> 02:18:19.680]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:28.668]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[02:18:28.948 --> 02:18:32.250]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:18:34.172 --> 02:18:34.452]  I think?

[02:19:18.125 --> 02:19:22.528]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders is skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[02:19:22.868 --> 02:19:23.289]  The U.S.
[02:19:23.329 --> 02:19:27.692]  dollar is free falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[02:19:27.792 --> 02:19:29.573]  are now seeking safer alternatives.

[02:19:46.803 --> 02:19:48.864]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[02:19:49.505 --> 02:19:58.431]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[02:19:58.872 --> 02:20:06.077]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[02:20:49.244 --> 02:20:53.488]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[02:20:54.068 --> 02:20:59.753]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[02:21:00.294 --> 02:21:06.420]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?

[02:21:49.678 --> 02:21:51.119]  Strange days are here.
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:21:52.721]  Strange days have found us.
[02:21:53.061 --> 02:22:06.752]  They're going to destroy us.
[02:22:07.973 --> 02:22:11.356]  Yeah, the controlled corporate brainwashing press knows the general public.
[02:22:12.417 --> 02:22:15.019]  Actually has no idea even about how the three branches of government work.
[02:22:15.980 --> 02:22:17.601]  Or the two houses of Congress.
[02:22:18.447 --> 02:22:24.236]  The two bodies or that earmarks and Ron Paul's put a statement out on this.
[02:22:24.276 --> 02:22:25.598]  He's explained this years ago.
[02:22:25.618 --> 02:22:26.720]  This is how earmarks work.
[02:22:27.261 --> 02:22:28.643]  They've spent all this pork money.
[02:22:28.703 --> 02:22:30.506]  He votes against the pork.
[02:22:31.098 --> 02:22:33.721]  Then they say, here's the money secreted to your district.
[02:22:33.741 --> 02:22:37.706]  But he doesn't bring statistically a lot of pork back.
[02:22:37.766 --> 02:22:38.787]  And they always criticize him.
[02:22:39.088 --> 02:22:42.452]  People that run against him always criticize him and say, you didn't bring us any pork.
[02:22:42.992 --> 02:22:45.135]  And he says, yeah, I voted against all these big spending bills.
[02:22:45.475 --> 02:22:50.562]  But then once they apportion the money, even the poultry sum that he gets for that area of South Texas on the coast,
[02:22:51.122 --> 02:22:51.622]  He gets it!
[02:22:52.023 --> 02:22:54.704]  And so he says, okay, I'll try to get shrimp back in the Gulf.
[02:22:54.744 --> 02:22:56.646]  That looks like a good place to spend some money.
[02:22:56.986 --> 02:22:57.586]  Free market.
[02:22:58.087 --> 02:22:59.688]  And he's being crucified for that.
[02:22:59.708 --> 02:23:02.049]  They're calling it a skeleton they uncovered.
[02:23:02.509 --> 02:23:07.193]  Meanwhile, you can have the other candidates involved in every form of corruption you can imagine.
[02:23:07.533 --> 02:23:17.799]  Giuliani with his daddy being a mob boss, and Sintra-Zachary foreign corporations grabbing the roads, and toll roads, and profiteering, and grabbing 9-11 funds in New York.
[02:23:18.080 --> 02:23:19.440]  Mike Rivera, you got the floor.
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:20.221]  Go over it for us.
[02:23:20.951 --> 02:23:26.556]  Well, basically, what it is, is Ron Paul is viewed by the current established order in D.C.
[02:23:26.676 --> 02:23:28.237]  as very much of an outsider.
[02:23:29.018 --> 02:23:43.330]  He is coming in there, he is bringing the real issues to this election, which is the war in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan, the lies that got us into these wars, and as long as he is in the running, then people have to talk about the war.
[02:23:43.991 --> 02:23:45.452]  And coming out of the 2006 elections,
[02:23:47.234 --> 02:23:51.738]  Politicians know the war is a loser for elections and campaigns.
[02:23:51.838 --> 02:23:57.462]  Congress was taken away from the GOP and handed to the Democrats on the basis of opposition to the war.
[02:23:57.762 --> 02:24:03.666]  The Democrats, of course, have turned into this incredible disappointment and everybody's wondering just, you know, how complicit they are.
[02:24:04.007 --> 02:24:06.649]  But nobody wants the war to be an issue going into 2008.
[02:24:07.729 --> 02:24:12.633]  And this is why we've seen the mainstream media continue to insist Ron Paul has no support.
[02:24:13.041 --> 02:24:18.869]  The numbers that he's getting online are just because he's got a few hackers working for him, running up the online polls.
[02:24:19.129 --> 02:24:26.319]  He's not real, he isn't there, and even though the debates he's been in, he clearly walks away in charge of.
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:28.282]  They're desperate to dismiss him.
[02:24:28.302 --> 02:24:37.406]  He's been winning one IP address polls that a lot of experts are saying are more scientific than a Gallup poll or they call a certain subset where they know what answer they're going to get.
[02:24:37.446 --> 02:24:39.927]  He's gone from not showing up to three points on the poll.
[02:24:40.227 --> 02:24:43.248]  He's raised more money than McCain.
[02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:48.791]  Las Vegas is saying he's the only person that can beat a Democrat and the Republicans know that.
[02:24:49.051 --> 02:24:53.713]  They're just meant to basically pass the baton, raise campaign money and keep it themselves.
[02:24:54.013 --> 02:24:56.554]  This is not a real election and he is a spoiler.
[02:24:56.974 --> 02:24:59.196]  It's a tempest in a teapot, and frankly I agree.
[02:24:59.236 --> 02:25:04.219]  We need to get some of that part of the economy of the country back running again.
[02:25:04.259 --> 02:25:06.820]  It's been over-fished, it's been over-harvested.
[02:25:20.325 --> 02:25:22.407]  And yeah, finding ways to revitalize that.
[02:25:22.467 --> 02:25:28.051]  I think I'd rather have my money spent on that than bombing the heck out of foreign countries.
[02:25:28.211 --> 02:25:29.132]  Well, that's what he said.
[02:25:29.172 --> 02:25:31.714]  He said several statements on this in the past.
[02:25:31.734 --> 02:25:33.796]  He said they would use it for CPS.
[02:25:34.076 --> 02:25:35.397]  They would use it for police state.
[02:25:35.417 --> 02:25:36.278]  They'd use it for the war.
[02:25:38.239 --> 02:25:38.840]  Absolutely.
[02:25:39.040 --> 02:25:45.085]  And this is why Ron Paul is really looking at what is wrong with the United States of America.
[02:25:45.669 --> 02:25:50.892]  And, you know, he wants to put the money there, and that is, of course, what everybody else wants to do as well.
[02:25:51.192 --> 02:26:07.402]  But I want to put out this little caution here, and that is that Ron Paul has become as much of a threat to the established pro-war machine as John Kennedy was to the CIA, or Robert Kennedy was to Nixon.
[02:26:07.662 --> 02:26:15.107]  And so I just hope Ron Paul's going to be really very, very careful, because when you become this much of a threat to the established oligarchy,
[02:26:15.818 --> 02:26:19.702]  Uh, you know, bad things can happen, and so I just hope he's got his Kevlar undies on.
[02:26:19.802 --> 02:26:30.052]  No, I, you know, we asked him about that a few months ago, and he spent a full hour with us, and he said that no, he knows they'll try to kill him if he gets big enough, and he said they always, and he listed a bunch of people they'd killed or wounded.
[02:26:31.713 --> 02:26:35.935]  And then Fox News attacked him Sunday because he comes on my show and said, Alex Jones!
[02:26:36.235 --> 02:26:37.415]  You go on with those nuts!
[02:26:37.455 --> 02:26:39.536]  And he said, well, I disagree with you, but I come on with you.
[02:26:39.596 --> 02:26:42.617]  You know, he said, I disagree with Alex on a few things, but I agree with him on other things.
[02:26:42.637 --> 02:26:44.138]  You know, he supports me.
[02:26:44.158 --> 02:26:44.978]  I'm supporting him.
[02:26:44.998 --> 02:26:50.500]  I mean, it just, to tell you, it spooks me out to have them talking about me, Mike.
[02:26:51.321 --> 02:26:52.341]  Well, I can imagine that.
[02:26:52.441 --> 02:26:58.924]  I've also noticed in the last few days that somebody is trying to drag Ron Paul into the middle of the 9-11 debate.
[02:27:00.109 --> 02:27:07.453]  And again, to me, it is just a case of trying to take the war from being center stage issue going into the 2008 election.
[02:27:07.693 --> 02:27:08.954]  And they're desperate to do it.
[02:27:09.234 --> 02:27:11.915]  And because they're desperate, what they're doing is really obvious.
[02:27:12.396 --> 02:27:16.618]  And I think to those of us who have been watching how the mainstream media has been manipulating elections for the last
[02:27:17.239 --> 02:27:18.139]  A couple of decades.
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:21.641]  It's almost laughably obvious, you know, how scared they are.
[02:27:21.861 --> 02:27:22.641]  Well, exactly.
[02:27:22.661 --> 02:27:29.244]  But what's laughable is if 82% of Americans think they were lied to about 9-11, that's just going to make Ron Paul popular.
[02:27:29.904 --> 02:27:32.165]  I mean, they misre... We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:27:32.366 --> 02:27:33.186]  Stay there, Mike Rivera.
[02:27:35.887 --> 02:27:36.807]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.288 --> 02:27:38.888]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.809 --> 02:27:42.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.121 --> 02:27:51.605]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:52.045 --> 02:27:56.268]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:56.689 --> 02:28:03.554]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:03.994 --> 02:28:10.697]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:11.017 --> 02:28:12.638]  There are no reported side effects.

[02:28:45.959 --> 02:28:47.600]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:55.283]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[02:28:55.443 --> 02:29:03.226]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[02:29:03.426 --> 02:29:04.507]  And there's no odor.
[02:29:04.747 --> 02:29:14.773]  Stabilized Allicin gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[02:29:14.833 --> 02:29:23.078]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[02:29:23.338 --> 02:29:28.461]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off.
[02:29:28.701 --> 02:29:37.552]  For more information, visit Garlic, the number 4, yourheart.com, or click on the banner at GCNlive.com, or call Amy personally at 805-595-2711.
[02:29:37.612 --> 02:29:37.853]  That's 805-595-2711.
[02:29:46.079 --> 02:29:48.641]  What's better than a tiny tiger in your tank?
[02:29:48.961 --> 02:29:50.502]  A tornado under your hood!
[02:29:50.862 --> 02:29:56.445]  A tornado is an easy-to-install, maintenance-free air twister designed to increase gas mileage.
[02:29:56.745 --> 02:30:03.829]  I personally commissioned independent tests to verify results in six vehicles and all of them gained MPG with Tornado.
[02:30:03.989 --> 02:30:08.772]  With today's gas prices, it makes sense to cage the gas-saving power of a tornado.
[02:30:08.932 --> 02:30:14.435]  Visit TornadoAir.com or pick up your tornado at Checkers, Shucks and Cragen today.
[02:30:16.438 --> 02:30:20.179]  In today's world of discord and disappointment, one thing's for sure.
[02:30:20.419 --> 02:30:25.220]  Car cover owners are so satisfied, they buy their car covers all over again.
[02:30:25.520 --> 02:30:27.001]  Think car covers are a hassle?
[02:30:27.261 --> 02:30:27.481]  No.
[02:30:27.801 --> 02:30:31.582]  Research shows owners find covers easy to put on and take off.
[02:30:31.982 --> 02:30:33.322]  Are all covers the same?
[02:30:33.582 --> 02:30:33.802]  No.
[02:30:34.082 --> 02:30:37.763]  The standard in car cover fabric is Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:30:38.163 --> 02:30:40.284]  Don't let sun and dust damage your car.
[02:30:40.564 --> 02:30:43.104]  Kimberly Clark's Block-It fabrics got you covered.
[02:30:43.365 --> 02:30:45.125]  That's Block-It by Kimberly Clark.
[02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:59.930]  Ron, Wendy, Mike, Ryan.
[02:30:59.950 --> 02:31:02.831]  Any others that are patiently holding?
[02:31:03.171 --> 02:31:08.753]  Anthony, we're going to get to your calls coming up in about 10 minutes or so.
[02:31:09.494 --> 02:31:12.275]  Michael Rivero is our guest joining us.
[02:31:12.475 --> 02:31:13.395]  Always honored to have him.
[02:31:14.675 --> 02:31:18.297]  I don't know if you've seen this Mitt Romney video we've got up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:18.317 --> 02:31:19.217]  We just got a link to it.
[02:31:20.181 --> 02:31:23.804]  But it shows the debate Sunday, and it shows hundreds of Ron Paul supporters.
[02:31:23.864 --> 02:31:32.869]  I'd say three to one to Mitt Romney, and you see a few other signs in there too, but I mean I'd say two-thirds are Ron Paul.
[02:31:33.390 --> 02:31:47.439]  It shows there's hundreds of people as the camera pans along, and then it shows in the video the very people that ABC News took photos of at the ABC News debate, which they didn't even promote and had in the early morning as everybody knows, and it shows
[02:31:48.500 --> 02:31:52.246]  One Ron Paul supporter, then it cuts to a huge mass of Mitt Romney people.
[02:31:54.068 --> 02:31:56.291]  Shooting from down low and them all squanched together.
[02:31:57.153 --> 02:31:58.815]  Using every trick in the book.
[02:31:59.275 --> 02:32:01.158]  I think that's going to backfire on them.
[02:32:01.178 --> 02:32:03.682]  Trying to claim, oh look he's for pork barrel.
[02:32:03.702 --> 02:32:05.224]  Everybody knows he's against pork barrel.
[02:32:06.071 --> 02:32:08.915]  And, uh, see, they know that's really popular to be against it.
[02:32:09.255 --> 02:32:10.977]  And they hate to even mention that, as Mike was saying.
[02:32:10.997 --> 02:32:13.741]  They want it to be about some football issue that'll never be decided.
[02:32:13.761 --> 02:32:16.084]  I'm not saying abortion and things aren't real issues.
[02:32:16.604 --> 02:32:21.410]  What I'm saying is they never want it to be, on one side or the other, conclusive.
[02:32:21.450 --> 02:32:22.792]  It's meant to just go on forever.
[02:32:23.402 --> 02:32:29.884]  And then, you know, gay marriage distractions and just all of this, you know, I mean, mindless diversions that they get us endlessly.
[02:32:29.944 --> 02:32:33.224]  I mean, the Democrats are going to have a thing about a whole debate about gays.
[02:32:33.284 --> 02:32:36.205]  I mean, I mean, you know, and again, I'm not bashing any group here.
[02:32:36.225 --> 02:32:42.686]  It's like, I mean, are we going to have a meeting about a debate about heterosexuals or, you know, a debate about Christmas trees?
[02:32:42.726 --> 02:32:44.267]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:32:44.887 --> 02:32:49.388]  Mike Rivera, this new video, though, showing this, that's only going to enrage people.
[02:32:50.453 --> 02:32:51.594]  Yeah, absolutely it is.
[02:32:51.874 --> 02:32:59.318]  And again, going back to the fact that the majority of Americans know that we were all lied to about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
[02:32:59.679 --> 02:33:09.044]  They know that the major networks were part and parcel to that lie, that they were complicit in the lie, that they have been very resistant to clarification of that lie.
[02:33:09.404 --> 02:33:12.926]  So not only are they guilty of it, they're basically unrepentant.
[02:33:13.207 --> 02:33:16.549]  They're still trying to perpetuate the lies and keep moving forward.
[02:33:16.769 --> 02:33:18.870]  They're not showing any trace of social conscience.
[02:33:19.284 --> 02:33:27.850]  By going back and saying, well, yeah, it was a lie that Saddam had nuclear weapons, or excuse me, nuclear weapons, the way Bush likes to say it.
[02:33:28.831 --> 02:33:29.651]  On the internets.
[02:33:30.292 --> 02:33:31.492]  Yeah, on the internets.
[02:33:31.673 --> 02:33:33.714]  I know the Google.
[02:33:33.814 --> 02:33:35.595]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:33:35.615 --> 02:33:46.743]  So, anyway, yeah, the majority of the American people are very skeptical, they're very wise to the fact that the mainstream media exists to sell them things.
[02:33:47.143 --> 02:33:48.544]  Including presidential candidates.
[02:33:48.885 --> 02:33:55.810]  And yeah, they're going to see this tape and they're going to realize that, yeah, the media is trying as hard as they can to bury Ron Paul.
[02:33:56.050 --> 02:33:58.252]  And what everybody needs to start asking is why?
[02:33:58.632 --> 02:34:04.337]  Why is this guy so much of... Why is he so terrifying?
[02:34:04.557 --> 02:34:15.066]  Because as you pointed out earlier, a lot of people think Ron Paul is the only candidate who could beat a Democrat like Hillary or Obama, and yet the GOP wants to shy away from him.
[02:34:15.106 --> 02:34:16.087]  And the reason, of course, is
[02:34:16.966 --> 02:34:19.928]  He brings the issue of the war to the election.
[02:34:20.128 --> 02:34:28.674]  And by the way, the GOP candidates, the other ones, to a man, won't even at least put out fake conservative rhetoric.
[02:34:28.975 --> 02:34:30.996]  They're not even trying to win!
[02:34:31.016 --> 02:34:33.738]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:34:33.938 --> 02:34:42.944]  And what was really interesting, going back to that debate with Mitt Romney, when Ron Paul was talking about, you know, why are we over in the Mideast attacking countries that didn't attack us?
[02:34:43.505 --> 02:34:45.906]  And Mitt Romney basically burst in with, well, what about 9-11?
[02:34:47.151 --> 02:34:58.502]  And what we did is, we have the video of Bush admitting that Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11, and we had all of our readers basically just mail that video to Mitt Romney's campaign office to send him a message.
[02:34:58.822 --> 02:35:07.070]  We know that you are misspeaking when you get up there and shout, what about 9-11, when Ron Paul is saying we should end these wars.
[02:35:07.150 --> 02:35:08.592]  But Dick Cheney still doesn't.
[02:35:10.731 --> 02:35:12.692]  Yeah, I'm sure that Dick Cheney still does.
[02:35:13.773 --> 02:35:18.395]  But again, I don't know that that many people are paying attention to him outside the mainstream media.
[02:35:18.836 --> 02:35:19.196]  I agree.
[02:35:19.236 --> 02:35:21.037]  He's a complete joke.
[02:35:21.057 --> 02:35:23.378]  10% approval rating now, down from 12 a month ago.
[02:35:24.078 --> 02:35:26.079]  And no one's ever had a 10%, folks.
[02:35:26.119 --> 02:35:28.901]  I mean, not even Nixon or Spiro Agnew or any of these criminals.
[02:35:30.041 --> 02:35:34.784]  I want to get into economy briefly, war with you briefly, and then take a few calls for Mike Rivera of WhatReallyHappened.com.
[02:35:35.604 --> 02:35:36.985]  But first, Mike,
[02:35:39.206 --> 02:35:42.228]  This martial law situation, you've been looking at that since Clinton was in office.
[02:35:42.248 --> 02:35:45.049]  You had one of the first political websites on the web, even before the drugs report.
[02:35:45.429 --> 02:35:46.590]  So you've been there since the start.
[02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:50.932]  I've never seen such preparation for a terror attack, such pre-hyping.
[02:35:51.252 --> 02:35:54.634]  I've never seen a president sign a PDD saying, I'm above Congress.
[02:35:54.954 --> 02:36:00.417]  And then Congress, now it's up to four members on the Homeland Security Board, write letters and make phone calls.
[02:36:00.737 --> 02:36:07.160]  And Homeland Security says, even though you're high as security clearance, you can't see what our secret plan is.
[02:36:07.780 --> 02:36:12.864]  I mean, that is the presidency announcing dictatorship, and Paul Craig Roberts said that first hour.
[02:36:12.904 --> 02:36:16.907]  This is worse than martial law, because at least Congress would be involved in the Continuity of Government.
[02:36:17.368 --> 02:36:18.629]  I mean, where do you see this going?
[02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:30.899]  I see it going very much in the direction that Bush wants it to go until somebody, and obviously it's not going to be the Congress, stands up to him and whacks him on the nose with a two-by-four and says, don't do that anymore.
[02:36:31.399 --> 02:36:35.062]  And what you're talking about, the media run up to a terrorist attack, if you think back
[02:36:35.889 --> 02:36:43.334]  To 2001, there was a brief interval between all Gary Condit all the time, which was used to distract Americans from U.S.
[02:36:43.774 --> 02:36:58.264]  government announcements of a coming war in Afghanistan, and there was this gap throughout most of August, where we were getting all these news stories about what a terrible person Osama bin Laden was, and how bad al-Qaeda was, and how mean and nasty things that they were planning to do.
[02:36:58.284 --> 02:37:01.526]  And they blow up the Buddhist temples and they're coming to get you any minute, yeah.
[02:37:02.270 --> 02:37:06.233]  And actually, at the time, in August of 2001, I wrote an article at the time.
[02:37:06.253 --> 02:37:07.674]  I said, something is coming up.
[02:37:07.734 --> 02:37:10.275]  They're pre-selling this guy too hard.
[02:37:10.635 --> 02:37:14.518]  Because Osama wasn't actually doing anything in any of these stories.
[02:37:14.538 --> 02:37:16.339]  Yeah, they had to brand him first.
[02:37:16.499 --> 02:37:17.680]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[02:37:17.700 --> 02:37:19.921]  The stories were all about what a bad man he is.
[02:37:20.302 --> 02:37:23.504]  And there wasn't anything in the story that they were reporting.
[02:37:23.544 --> 02:37:24.024]  It wasn't like,
[02:37:24.341 --> 02:37:28.502]  Osama blows up, you know, a bus and burns his lips on the exhaust pipe or something.
[02:37:28.743 --> 02:37:30.643]  It was just, we say he's a bad man.
[02:37:31.303 --> 02:37:32.224]  And they hurt women.
[02:37:32.764 --> 02:37:42.987]  And I remember seeing Gary Hart and Warren Rudman on the CFR Commission that wrote up the Homeland Security Plan before it happened, bragging on Hardball, where they said, something big's coming, life's going to change.
[02:37:43.428 --> 02:37:46.989]  And Matthew started laughing and saying, thank you for sharing this, I'm so honored.
[02:37:47.609 --> 02:37:50.270]  And then they said, yeah, big buildings, there's going to be troops on the streets.
[02:37:50.290 --> 02:37:52.430]  And they were laughing, going, big buildings and laughing.
[02:37:52.690 --> 02:37:56.771]  They actually had a wicked little gang member celebration on TV.
[02:37:57.171 --> 02:38:05.613]  And then I was at the grocery store later that day and I saw Bin Laden on all the magazines, because they know the lowest denominator hits their news by just looking at that.
[02:38:05.933 --> 02:38:08.813]  And I went on there and I said, they're going to attack the World Trade Center.
[02:38:08.833 --> 02:38:10.394]  Because I knew the Feds had bonded before.
[02:38:10.534 --> 02:38:11.554]  Criminals always come back.
[02:38:12.235 --> 02:38:16.009]  And I said, uh, it's gonna happen, and I said, call the White House, tell them don't do it.
[02:38:16.270 --> 02:38:17.936]  I mean, that's how obvious this was, Mike.
[02:38:18.897 --> 02:38:20.298]  It was very obvious back then.
[02:38:20.318 --> 02:38:21.659]  It is equally obvious now.
[02:38:22.720 --> 02:38:34.628]  We're seeing, from where I sit, we're seeing this huge faction fight inside the federal government where there are large portions of the government that don't want to do another 9-11 because they know the American people are not going to buy it.
[02:38:35.008 --> 02:38:39.131]  They don't want to do any more wars because they're seeing that we're losing in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:38:39.151 --> 02:38:41.072]  They think it's an insane idea.
[02:38:41.352 --> 02:38:45.335]  They realize that we're mostly fighting these wars at the behest of a foreign government.
[02:38:45.916 --> 02:38:56.224]  And they don't want to do that anymore, but you've got just these isolated individuals in positions of tremendous power who want to move this thing forward, and they don't care what they have to do to do it.
[02:38:56.545 --> 02:39:09.495]  So it's kind of a scary thing that the future course of our entire history is going to be determined by whichever one of our leaders is the least mentally stable and willing to carry out another staged terror attack.
[02:39:09.595 --> 02:39:12.758]  Now, if this isn't crazy enough, we'll go ahead and finish your point.
[02:39:14.167 --> 02:39:20.733]  No, and basically, you know, those who are willing to do anything to attain power are usually going to be willing to do anything with it.
[02:39:22.475 --> 02:39:27.356]  And as if all this isn't dangerous enough, and really, I mean, I'm freaked out, folks, and I live this every day.
[02:39:27.676 --> 02:39:28.996]  This is really happening.
[02:39:29.796 --> 02:39:32.357]  I mean, he's now announced he's a dictator, publicly.
[02:39:32.897 --> 02:39:35.718]  As if that isn't bad enough, the dollar is in a complete nosedive.
[02:39:35.758 --> 02:39:37.318]  The housing market is starting to implode.
[02:39:37.598 --> 02:39:41.639]  Not just the arms or the jumbo loans, but the whole nine yards.
[02:39:42.379 --> 02:39:44.439]  Quote, good lending risks are now defaulting.
[02:39:44.659 --> 02:39:47.860]  The second biggest lender in mortgages just went belly up yesterday.
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:53.844]  I mean, we've got inflation at 13.6% with the real brokerage houses numbers per annum.
[02:39:54.244 --> 02:39:55.485]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:39:55.505 --> 02:39:59.888]  I mean, Mike Rivera, we are living in just... it's incredible!
[02:40:00.829 --> 02:40:09.535]  It absolutely is, and certainly the economy is a big, big, big problem because Bush and his neocons have been basically printing up the money to spend on their war.
[02:40:10.211 --> 02:40:15.755]  And up until now, they were relying on the exploding real estate market to act as a cash sink.
[02:40:16.135 --> 02:40:22.860]  They would print up the money at the Federal Reserve, they'd spend it on bombs and bullets and weapons, and defense contractors.
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:28.944]  The money would go into circulation, but then it would get soaked up by everybody buying these new, much more expensive homes.
[02:40:29.505 --> 02:40:36.990]  And on paper, it looked like people were getting rich, but they're still in the same $40,000 home their parents had with three bedrooms, two baths, and a leaky roof.
[02:40:37.466 --> 02:40:41.029]  It's the same physical assets, it just costs a lot more.
[02:40:41.249 --> 02:40:48.053]  Listen, four bedroom houses that aren't in dangerous neighborhoods are $600,000 in this town.
[02:40:48.093 --> 02:40:50.975]  I mean, just ten years ago, those houses were $150,000.
[02:40:51.075 --> 02:40:58.981]  It is, and see that jump up in price is what's been soaking up the surplus money that has been printed up to pay for the wars.
[02:40:59.352 --> 02:41:12.800]  But now that the real estate market has busted, and that cash sink is no longer working, now we're going to see all that extra money chasing too few goods and services, and we're going to start to see prices really skyrocket, and inflation's going to get out of control.
[02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:21.686]  And generally, that's what the rule's been about two years for just maniac inflationary printing to be felt, and then it eases in.
[02:41:22.366 --> 02:41:27.189]  But this has been so overboard, I mean, even the easing in is going to be like getting hit in the head with a jackhammer.
[02:41:27.970 --> 02:41:31.113]  It absolutely is, and we're seeing so many foreclosures around here.
[02:41:31.153 --> 02:41:32.935]  I live in a pretty good neighborhood here in Hawaii.
[02:41:33.255 --> 02:41:36.298]  We've got a house up the street, nice house, gone into foreclosure.
[02:41:36.898 --> 02:41:43.864]  I've got friends on the mainland who say there are three foreclosures just on the street where she lives, and it's really going crazy.
[02:41:43.884 --> 02:41:49.730]  We're starting to see TV commercials here where they're saying, we have foreclosed homes for you to buy real, real cheap.
[02:41:50.030 --> 02:41:51.972]  All you have to do is pay the outstanding balance.
[02:41:52.921 --> 02:42:00.122]  You know, it's still a lot of money, but when you see them advertising foreclosure sales on TV, you know it's getting really bad out there.
[02:42:00.894 --> 02:42:04.677]  But meanwhile, there's still a whole other layer of news going, everything's wonderful!
[02:42:04.857 --> 02:42:06.558]  The war on terror is fabulous!
[02:42:06.818 --> 02:42:08.959]  No warrants to spy is good!
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:11.321]  Police in black ski masks is fun!
[02:42:11.341 --> 02:42:15.464]  You know, uh, Prozac and Ritalin with 20% of the population on it!
[02:42:15.704 --> 02:42:17.605]  CPS snatching kids everywhere!
[02:42:17.625 --> 02:42:19.526]  Illegal aliens running all over us!
[02:42:19.766 --> 02:42:20.707]  It's wonderful!
[02:42:20.967 --> 02:42:23.989]  Huge TB, uh, hospitals having to be set up!
[02:42:24.289 --> 02:42:24.850]  Oh, it's good!
[02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:26.751]  Flesh eating back, I mean, it's, you know.
[02:42:27.660 --> 02:42:29.781]  There was a wonderful quote from Jay Leno the other night.
[02:42:29.801 --> 02:42:31.301]  He said, the big story in Washington, D.C.
[02:42:31.361 --> 02:42:34.942]  is not the war in Iraq, not Alberto Gonzales lying to Congress, not healthcare.
[02:42:35.182 --> 02:42:38.483]  The big story everyone's talking about is Hillary Clinton showing a little cleavage.
[02:42:39.043 --> 02:42:42.684]  The United States is 231 years old, but apparently the media is only 13.
[02:42:44.005 --> 02:42:44.625]  Exactly!
[02:42:44.645 --> 02:42:48.226]  But they've also had studies out now that people don't want to see Paris Hilton.
[02:42:48.606 --> 02:42:51.327]  They don't want to see the latest O.J.
[02:42:51.367 --> 02:42:54.428]  or Anna Nicole Schmitz, but the media force feeds it.
[02:42:55.268 --> 02:42:59.134]  Yeah, because that's the media's job to keep everybody dazzled and distracted.
[02:42:59.635 --> 02:43:05.625]  The media today in the United States is fulfilling the same function as the Coliseum filled in Imperial Rome.
[02:43:06.050 --> 02:43:11.611]  It keeps the public distracted so they're not paying attention to what Caligula is doing with his sister in the back room.
[02:43:11.631 --> 02:43:13.052]  Mike, you've been around a long time.
[02:43:13.092 --> 02:43:14.972]  You're a top special effects guy also.
[02:43:14.992 --> 02:43:20.554]  We don't get into that, but the point is, you're a successful fellow, smart guy, and you've been around longer than I have.
[02:43:20.594 --> 02:43:21.254]  You've seen this.
[02:43:21.774 --> 02:43:22.994]  How bad do you think it's going to get?
[02:43:23.094 --> 02:43:23.934]  Big recession?
[02:43:24.335 --> 02:43:25.295]  Huge recession?
[02:43:25.675 --> 02:43:27.455]  Depression that they'll call a recession?
[02:43:29.636 --> 02:43:30.196]  What's going to happen?
[02:43:31.805 --> 02:43:34.707]  I think we're in for a very, very hard time.
[02:43:34.787 --> 02:43:40.150]  I don't know what they'll call it, because the labels sort of get made up based on political necessity at the time.
[02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:56.378]  But because of the over-leveraging and the derivatives situation, I think what we've started to see already in the hedge funds is going to start spreading to a lot of other mutuals and various other investment packages.
[02:43:56.418 --> 02:44:00.540]  And we're going to see a lot of people who've worked their entire lives to build themselves a good retirement,
[02:44:00.831 --> 02:44:01.071]  That's right.
[02:44:18.949 --> 02:44:26.652]  This has been engineered for you to keep you so poor you cannot quit working, which is the real goal of capitalism here.
[02:44:27.172 --> 02:44:32.554]  And this is not free market, this is crony capitalism, or corporatism, fascism, whatever you want to call it.
[02:44:33.054 --> 02:44:35.875]  Understand folks, they brag they engineered the 29 crash.
[02:44:35.975 --> 02:44:40.377]  All I know is the numbers we're talking about here are astronomically worse.
[02:44:40.977 --> 02:44:50.060]  Okay, and we're at a higher private debt ratio than the depth of the depression in November of 33, and we passed that line in January of this year, eight months ago.
[02:44:50.540 --> 02:45:04.065]  So what I want everybody to understand here is that they will not drop the hammer completely on us if we blame them, but if we let them spin it in a hundred news specials that we're a bunch of pig people and we deserve this,
[02:45:04.645 --> 02:45:08.828]  And to a small extent, you know, certainly we played along with it, but no, Mike is right.
[02:45:08.948 --> 02:45:10.750]  This is engineering.
[02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:18.876]  They'll burn a few brokers and a few more Martha Stewart's, but that is just, that is icing on the cake in the propaganda, Mike.
[02:45:19.716 --> 02:45:33.729]  Well, you know, we're already starting to see that because there have already been a couple of news stories put out attempting to say that the reason the bridge collapsed in Minneapolis is because Americans were unwilling to spend the extra highway taxes to take care of our roads.
[02:45:33.829 --> 02:45:35.550]  And hand them over to foreign corporations!
[02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.851]  Yes.
[02:45:36.611 --> 02:45:40.375]  No mention of the half trillion dollars going into Iraq.
[02:45:40.655 --> 02:45:46.100]  No mention of 30 billion going to Israel to get their permission to sell airplanes to Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:46.967 --> 02:45:55.455]  No mention whatsoever of the fact that we have already been paying high taxes, supposedly to take care of our own country, only to see the money taken out.
[02:45:55.795 --> 02:45:56.356]  It's amazing.
[02:45:56.376 --> 02:45:57.397]  We've got to take some calls.
[02:45:57.497 --> 02:45:58.778]  It's just amazing.
[02:45:59.299 --> 02:46:00.039]  This is incredible.
[02:46:00.900 --> 02:46:02.742]  These are the times that try people's souls.
[02:46:02.762 --> 02:46:03.963]  This is not a boring time to be alive.
[02:46:04.243 --> 02:46:07.946]  Ron in New York wanted to call in about a very draconian gun bill.
[02:46:08.086 --> 02:46:08.787]  Another one?
[02:46:08.807 --> 02:46:11.069]  I mean, I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[02:46:11.870 --> 02:46:12.871]  Ron's always a good source.
[02:46:13.571 --> 02:46:15.813]  Retired police officers, I wanted to trust his call.
[02:46:16.333 --> 02:46:17.794]  Tell me what's going on real fast, Ron.
[02:46:18.135 --> 02:46:21.957]  Okay, this is what happened in the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday afternoon.
[02:46:22.518 --> 02:46:26.661]  They took the bill, which you and your audience may know as H.R.
[02:46:26.681 --> 02:46:29.783]  2640, they metamorphosized it for the third time.
[02:46:29.803 --> 02:46:33.446]  It's the trick that they're using to enable deception on the bill.
[02:46:33.926 --> 02:46:39.470]  They merged it with several other unrelated bills, and in fact, they're going to renumber the bill
[02:46:40.143 --> 02:46:41.965]  Uh, it will be given an S designation.
[02:46:42.025 --> 02:46:50.933]  They did this as they were on the cusp of going out the door for vacation to gum up the works, so that- Now they already passed one gun control bill, and then now they've got another one?
[02:46:51.194 --> 02:46:52.855]  They metamorphosized that bill.
[02:46:52.875 --> 02:47:00.983]  This is the second metamorphosis of that bill, because every time the public gets wise to what they're doing, they take another skip and a jump and re-change it.
[02:47:01.063 --> 02:47:03.045]  Now what they've done is they've taken 2640,
[02:47:04.485 --> 02:47:08.426]  They're using stealth, almost clandestine methods of legislating to do this.
[02:47:08.946 --> 02:47:09.186]  Alright?
[02:47:09.226 --> 02:47:12.227]  In fact, there's never been one sentence or word of debate about this.
[02:47:12.527 --> 02:47:14.908]  Well, they said the immigration bill was secret, remember?
[02:47:14.928 --> 02:47:22.430]  Yeah, well, this is even better than that, because most people don't know what's going on, because the methods they're doing are really, really, I spy legislating.
[02:47:22.831 --> 02:47:30.773]  Now, what they've done is they've taken 2640, which was a horrible bill, and they may have, at least this is cursory, tentative information that I've gotten,
[02:47:31.283 --> 02:47:38.087]  Kicked it up a notch and made it worse to where they may have added, I believe, some clauses in the bill that was already a horrible bill.
[02:47:38.428 --> 02:47:40.289]  What's the bill number right now?
[02:47:40.849 --> 02:47:42.370]  It hasn't been... They're using trickery.
[02:47:42.410 --> 02:47:43.851]  They haven't assigned a bill number to it.
[02:47:44.492 --> 02:47:45.232]  This is all fraud.
[02:47:45.272 --> 02:47:48.354]  This is all legislative fraud to keep you in the dark about it.
[02:47:48.774 --> 02:47:50.536]  They're trying to fast-track this bill.
[02:47:50.556 --> 02:47:52.377]  They don't even want there to be debate on it.
[02:47:52.557 --> 02:47:54.698]  I know the title of the bill if you want to know that.
[02:47:54.738 --> 02:47:55.159]  Give it to us.
[02:47:55.379 --> 02:48:00.142]  It will be called the School Safety and Law Enforcement
[02:48:01.081 --> 02:48:04.422]  In the Law Enforcement Improvement Act.
[02:48:04.462 --> 02:48:08.024]  The School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act.
[02:48:08.044 --> 02:48:15.327]  Tell you what Mike, write me up a blurb on email and send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com 2 ways and we'll get it up and I'll call more frequently.
[02:48:15.347 --> 02:48:16.787]  I always love hearing from you.
[02:48:17.147 --> 02:48:22.830]  Mike Rivera, they really have circled the wagons and I think they're going to accelerate their fall.
[02:48:22.870 --> 02:48:23.310]  What do you think?
[02:48:24.008 --> 02:48:31.190]  Yeah, I think they're going to accelerate their fall, but before that, they're going to try and accelerate their establishment of a true dictatorship in this country.
[02:48:31.470 --> 02:48:40.093]  And grabbing the guns has to be a high priority, and what that signals is, they know they're going to push us to the point where a violent revolution seems like the best option.
[02:48:40.373 --> 02:48:42.874]  And that tells us we have not seen the worst of the abuses yet.
[02:48:43.094 --> 02:48:45.815]  Oh my God, it's going to be, it's going to be a bad one.
[02:48:48.869 --> 02:48:54.335]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.735 --> 02:49:02.363]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.058 --> 02:49:10.122]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.522 --> 02:49:21.948]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.248 --> 02:49:25.750]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.211 --> 02:49:28.152]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.472 --> 02:49:32.314]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.711 --> 02:50:48.212]  Do you know how much you can go with solar for under $1,200 now?
[02:50:48.232 --> 02:50:49.852]  Hi, this is Ken Soller.
[02:50:50.052 --> 02:50:54.194]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:50:54.804 --> 02:50:59.687]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[02:51:00.208 --> 02:51:06.632]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[02:51:07.370 --> 02:51:10.072]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:51:10.232 --> 02:51:20.199]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:51:20.479 --> 02:51:24.182]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:51:24.242 --> 02:51:30.726]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:51:30.906 --> 02:51:31.947]  Are you ready to go solar?
[02:51:32.147 --> 02:51:33.108]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[02:51:37.010 --> 02:51:41.071]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[02:51:41.311 --> 02:51:43.671]  That's KenSolar.com.
[02:51:48.452 --> 02:51:49.732]  Folks, I've got a load of phone lines.
[02:51:49.752 --> 02:51:50.693]  We've got five minutes left.
[02:51:50.713 --> 02:51:55.193]  I'm going to try to jam Wendy and Mike and Ryan, maybe, and all these others.
[02:51:55.833 --> 02:51:59.774]  I have to get Mike up more often than once a month and for more than 45 minutes.
[02:52:02.595 --> 02:52:04.015]  Before I go back to Mike Rivero,
[02:52:05.549 --> 02:52:05.989]  Keep playing.
[02:52:06.009 --> 02:52:07.170]  I don't like to hear that in the background.
[02:52:08.091 --> 02:52:14.515]  Before we go back to Mike Rivero, I want to just tell you about efooddirect.com.
[02:52:14.535 --> 02:52:17.317]  That's the website for the J. Michael Stevens Group and Steve Schenck.
[02:52:17.837 --> 02:52:23.621]  It's the highest quality, longest continually operating food company in 26 years here in the United States.
[02:52:23.721 --> 02:52:25.763]  I've bought food from them, gotten food from them twice.
[02:52:27.055 --> 02:52:31.980]  Uh, and uh, it's just the highest quality and they've got some new little boogie packs that are a month's supply.
[02:52:32.560 --> 02:52:36.244]  And they got two month's supplies for one person that just fit in two boxes right in your trunk.
[02:52:36.784 --> 02:52:39.367]  With really tasty meals, high nutrition value.
[02:52:39.807 --> 02:52:42.750]  This stuff is light years ahead of MREs and much less expensive.
[02:52:43.490 --> 02:52:46.073]  Uh, it is just the name in storable foods.
[02:52:46.673 --> 02:52:49.416]  And uh, everybody needs to be getting geared up and ready for whatever comes.
[02:52:49.436 --> 02:52:50.497]  This is insurance you can eat.
[02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:59.106]  1-800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:52:59.206 --> 02:53:01.448]  Call them or check out their website today.
[02:53:01.548 --> 02:53:02.128]  Do not wait.
[02:53:03.369 --> 02:53:06.292]  Mike Rivero, you know, I haven't had enough time.
[02:53:06.352 --> 02:53:09.694]  I hope you'll come on next week again for a full hour, because I want to be able to get to all these calls.
[02:53:09.714 --> 02:53:10.875]  Let's jam in one right now.
[02:53:11.255 --> 02:53:13.277]  Wendy in New York, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:53:13.297 --> 02:53:14.558]  Hi.
[02:53:14.998 --> 02:53:15.599]  Hello, go ahead.
[02:53:16.399 --> 02:53:20.002]  Hi, I just wanted to call and tell you that yesterday, I'm a 9-1-1 activist,
[02:53:21.888 --> 02:53:26.690]  I organized for Rochester 9-11 Truth and yesterday I was arrested at a protest.
[02:53:27.470 --> 02:53:32.352]  My camera was confiscated and everyone in the crowd was harassed.
[02:53:34.213 --> 02:53:36.534]  As far as cameras, they were searching cars for cameras.
[02:53:36.554 --> 02:53:38.495]  They were grabbing cameras out of media.
[02:53:39.542 --> 02:53:44.365]  I had a trespass on and I was the only one that got their camera confiscated.
[02:53:44.645 --> 02:53:51.369]  So now with the new, can't film but for 30 minutes, they were already telling us we couldn't film before, now they're just snatching and grabbing everything.
[02:53:51.989 --> 02:54:00.094]  Yes, I was told that if I didn't identify the other people in the crowd taking pictures I'd be arrested and my camera would be confiscated, which I rely on.
[02:54:00.654 --> 02:54:05.978]  And so they did that, they went ahead and took it and arrested me, charged with trespassing.
[02:54:06.658 --> 02:54:08.339]  Where were you when they charged you with trespassing?
[02:54:09.409 --> 02:54:20.662]  Um, I was on the property, I was on private property, but the problem was I was confronting Randy, I was going in to protest Randy Coole, who is our congressman.
[02:54:21.611 --> 02:54:24.774]  And his office is on private property.
[02:54:24.954 --> 02:54:25.894]  No, no, I understand.
[02:54:25.934 --> 02:54:26.795]  Well, look, they're already on.
[02:54:26.835 --> 02:54:28.696]  Listen, I need to get your name, your info.
[02:54:28.717 --> 02:54:34.341]  I need to give you to Aaron Dykes so we can get a blurb up on JonesReport.com about this.
[02:54:35.542 --> 02:54:43.187]  We don't screen calls because we're all about the First Amendment, but it's also a problem because if I'd have known this, I'd have had you on 30 minutes ago when you first started holding.
[02:54:43.207 --> 02:54:44.308]  And I'm sorry to all the callers.
[02:54:44.368 --> 02:54:45.749]  Because of this, we're now out of time.
[02:54:46.270 --> 02:54:47.230]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:54:47.491 --> 02:54:48.952]  Mike, Ryan,
[02:54:49.712 --> 02:54:51.632]  Andrew and others will get to you first in line.
[02:54:51.993 --> 02:54:55.333]  But stay there, Wendy, because I want to get your name and number and contact info.
[02:54:55.553 --> 02:54:57.794]  But Mike Rivera, we're seeing more and more of this, aren't we?
[02:54:58.554 --> 02:55:05.875]  Yeah, we are, and I think the immediate solution is to always buy really cheap and expensive cameras you can live without when you're going to go to film at these events.
[02:55:05.915 --> 02:55:18.738]  But yeah, it's an indication that the government knows that these kind of stories get out on the Internet, and they can't block the Internet, so they're going to just try and block the citizen investigators and reporters from videotaping these events.
[02:55:19.158 --> 02:55:23.880]  What happens is, they get multiple generation old cameras that are still great, but nobody wants them.
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:31.524]  You can buy a one chip camera from 3 or 4 years ago for like $50 with the chargers and batteries off eBay.
[02:55:32.704 --> 02:55:33.324]  Wendy, stay there.
[02:55:33.344 --> 02:55:34.665]  I'm going to get your info at the end of the show.
[02:55:34.725 --> 02:55:35.946]  Mike, go ahead and continue commenting.
[02:55:36.686 --> 02:55:37.606]  Basically, that's it.
[02:55:37.666 --> 02:55:41.628]  If you're going to be covering these stories, then please send in your videos to Alex Jones and to me.
[02:55:41.668 --> 02:55:42.408]  We'll put them up there.
[02:55:42.709 --> 02:55:48.031]  But use an inexpensive camera because, yes, the police are confiscating and in some cases they're just smashing cameras.
[02:55:50.898 --> 02:55:57.021]  How do you think cops got to the point, well I've seen them on the street do it, where we're bad to have cameras but they're putting cameras on us?
[02:55:58.482 --> 02:56:07.388]  Do those cops have any idea what's going to happen to their bank accounts and everything else, that they're going to get nailed by the same people?
[02:56:08.032 --> 02:56:12.135]  They're probably convinced that if they go along with it that they will not be touched.
[02:56:12.615 --> 02:56:14.757]  You know, it's like that line from the movie Blade Runners.
[02:56:14.777 --> 02:56:16.458]  There's cops and then there's the little people.
[02:56:16.919 --> 02:56:20.741]  And I think there's a lot of that attitude that's starting to take hold inside law enforcement.
[02:56:20.961 --> 02:56:21.522]  I agree, Mike.
[02:56:21.562 --> 02:56:22.062]  God bless you.
[02:56:22.082 --> 02:56:22.883]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:56:25.505 --> 02:56:30.108]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
