[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:04.990]  Television, but I had once or twice actually seen the television show because it's very popular.
[00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.571]  One of the most popular on cable, on FX, Rescue Me.
[00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:10.952]  The star of Rescue Me.
[00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:13.352]  And he plays the fireman Franco on the program.
[00:00:14.093 --> 00:00:17.653]  And he's had a lot of other roles, of course, in television and movies.
[00:00:17.874 --> 00:00:20.894]  But the point is, he has the courage to go public on 9-11.
[00:00:22.135 --> 00:00:27.476]  You know, frankly, Kurt Vonnegut didn't
[00:00:29.838 --> 00:00:33.340]  It was never clear if Kurt Vonnegut wanted his views on 9-11 to be public.
[00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:39.744]  So I didn't make his full views that have been relayed to me and through him to me on 9-11.
[00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.407]  As we put a story out yesterday about was Kurt Vonnegut a 9-11 truther?
[00:00:43.887 --> 00:00:47.469]  The headline probably should have been Kurt Vonnegut was a 9-11 skeptic.
[00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.573]  I found out that he'd seen my films by one of his business partners, his associate.
[00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.134]  Then I got in contact with him.
[00:00:55.194 --> 00:00:57.115]  I sent him more of my films per request.
[00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:04.773]  And Kurt Vonnegut then sent me a signed, you know, one of his lithograph paintings of the open birdcage.
[00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:08.838]  You know, the freedom of the mind, I guess, or freedom of the soul is what it symbolizes, he said.
[00:01:08.858 --> 00:01:10.420]  Or just, you know, freedom.
[00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.550]  And, you know, hand signed.
[00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:18.852]  I just felt like, you know, the guy died two days ago, it was public yesterday, and that's important historically.
[00:01:18.872 --> 00:01:25.674]  I mean, he said the only difference between Bush, this is an exact quote, the only difference between Bush and Hitler is that Hitler was elected.
[00:01:26.214 --> 00:01:33.256]  And he was elected the President, and then he became President and Chancellor, abolished those offices for the office of the FÃ¼hrer.
[00:01:33.836 --> 00:01:36.177]  When von Hindenburg died, he became the Chancellor as well.
[00:01:37.438 --> 00:01:49.133]  So, yes, bottom line, Kurt Vonnegut, another, you know, just an icon, was investigating 9-11 and I can tell you knew that it certainly wasn't what we were told.
[00:01:49.794 --> 00:01:52.978]  But I'm going to leave it at that because some of that stuff that was relayed to me was private.
[00:01:55.592 --> 00:01:58.133]  We deserve to know that, so I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:00.873]  There were a few skeptics on the message board going, what are you doing?
[00:02:00.893 --> 00:02:01.913]  What are you posting this for?
[00:02:02.414 --> 00:02:09.795]  You know, so you claim he sent you this letter and he sent you this little picture, a hand sign.
[00:02:10.075 --> 00:02:10.795]  Oh, I bet.
[00:02:11.596 --> 00:02:17.957]  Well, folks, I mean, it's really true that James Brolin's gone public on 9-11 and Rosie O'Donnell and Charlie Sheen and
[00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:24.844]  And frankly, if I told you the people that I know personally that know about 9-11, it even dwarfs those huge celebrities.
[00:02:25.225 --> 00:02:36.458]  Of the top five biggest people in Hollywood, I personally talked to three of the biggest, okay, who've known for years it's an inside job, but they're not going to go public, and I'm not going to blow their cover.
[00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:37.479]  But I'm going to shut up about that.
[00:02:39.012 --> 00:02:44.855]  Daniel Sanjata has incredible courage, and he joins us now via cell phone.
[00:02:45.355 --> 00:02:46.896]  Are you in Chicago or Los Angeles?
[00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:49.137]  I'm actually in New York City right now.
[00:02:49.638 --> 00:02:50.678]  You're in New York right now.
[00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:53.740]  Well, thanks for listening for three minutes while I babble.
[00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:06.046]  Tell us a little bit about yourself, about your TV show, why you like playing the fireman, some of the easy stuff up front, and then how you woke up to 9-11 and what you think happened and what the repercussions have been of going public.
[00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:06.959]  Sure.
[00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.403]  Well, you know, there really haven't been too many repercussions at this point, Alex.
[00:03:11.463 --> 00:03:22.031]  I think I'm a small enough fish in the pond that my coming out publicly about 9-11 being an inside job has not created any, you know, tremendous, you know, seismic disturbances.
[00:03:23.632 --> 00:03:30.777]  But I did want to say, though, I think it really is getting to a point where it's... I don't know the quote exactly.
[00:03:30.797 --> 00:03:33.279]  I've heard you say it many, many times, though, that
[00:03:33.723 --> 00:03:40.087]  You know, and I'm hoping that you can repeat it for my benefit, maybe for the benefit of your audience members who might also not remember it.
[00:03:40.127 --> 00:03:45.189]  Something about when a patriot first speaks out, it's something that's dangerous.
[00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.930]  Sure, sure.
[00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:46.750]  It's Mark Twain.
[00:03:46.790 --> 00:04:01.138]  I usually flummox it myself, but I mean, the full quote is, a patriot in the beginning is a scarce man, hated and feared and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.979]  That was Mark Twain.
[00:04:02.657 --> 00:04:03.619]  Amen, amen to that.
[00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:18.560]  I think it really is getting to the point where it's, I wouldn't say it's getting to the point where it may cost nothing to be a patriot, but it certainly seems like it's getting to that very critical tipping point where speaking out about 9-11 truth is something that's becoming almost popular to do.
[00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:21.097]  And I don't know what exactly it is.
[00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:26.620]  You know, it's almost like I'm watching this huge dam that seems like it should have broken about three, four months ago.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:35.764]  And maybe when loose change hits theaters this summer, maybe if we can finally get a very public platform for people like Professor Stephen Jones.
[00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:42.631]  Uh, yourself, other people who have come out publicly, Rosie, Charlie, to actually talk about these issues.
[00:04:42.691 --> 00:04:53.203]  Maybe then, maybe then it'll, the dam will completely break and it'll become, we'll have an opportunity to really debate the actual facts of and points of contention in a public arena.
[00:04:53.243 --> 00:04:54.564]  That's what I'm really hoping for.
[00:04:54.584 --> 00:04:56.146]  In terms of my background,
[00:04:58.187 --> 00:04:59.428]  Again, I'm a small fish in the pond.
[00:04:59.508 --> 00:05:01.349]  I'm a working actor in New York City.
[00:05:01.649 --> 00:05:18.036]  The only reason why I felt like me speaking out may possibly be important in any way is because I happen to be representing, me and the other guys on the show, we're representing these heroes, these men and women who died that day and who risk their lives daily doing a job that most of us do not have the courage to do.
[00:05:19.318 --> 00:05:27.514]  And my moral conscience just wouldn't let me, would not let me remain silent considering the grave importance of this particular issue.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.982]  Well, I wouldn't call you a small fish, but I would say this.
[00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:34.765]  I mean, I'm a nobody, but we're all a somebody at the same time.
[00:05:35.486 --> 00:05:46.214]  And it is courage for a school teacher that goes public, or a professor, or a police officer, or a fighter pilot, or somebody with one of the most highly rated TV shows on cable.
[00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:48.336]  I mean, you're not a small fish.
[00:05:48.396 --> 00:05:49.376]  It does take courage.
[00:05:49.957 --> 00:05:52.699]  And you're right that it's getting a little bit safer for people to go public.
[00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:55.141]  I just wish that some of the really huge names
[00:05:56.287 --> 00:05:56.728]  I think so.
[00:06:12.463 --> 00:06:14.284]  I mean, there's just so much going on.
[00:06:14.604 --> 00:06:15.564]  This is do or die.
[00:06:15.804 --> 00:06:18.485]  I mean, these globalists, I mean, they may set off a nuke.
[00:06:18.725 --> 00:06:19.725]  They could start a new war.
[00:06:19.765 --> 00:06:20.905]  They could release bird flu.
[00:06:21.205 --> 00:06:22.966]  I mean, you can't put anything past them.
[00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:27.046]  Give me your response or your angle on what I just said there.
[00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:28.447]  Absolutely.
[00:06:28.587 --> 00:06:32.908]  I mean, I really do think that it's crucial, especially before the 2008 elections.
[00:06:32.948 --> 00:06:38.349]  I mean, I've heard your predictions and I've heard predictions from other pretty credible experts who are very good at kind of analyzing the
[00:06:39.256 --> 00:06:41.258]  The weather patterns, so to speak.
[00:06:42.238 --> 00:06:43.920]  You predicted 9-11.
[00:06:45.181 --> 00:06:50.184]  Other people are now saying that we're militarizing the area right around the borders of Iran.
[00:06:50.625 --> 00:06:59.911]  All of the same indicators are present that were present before 9-11 for some kind of terrible, terrible event.
[00:06:59.951 --> 00:07:04.134]  I agree with you that unless we call enough attention to 9-11,
[00:07:05.074 --> 00:07:24.589]  Unless we're able to bring this out into a public form of debate, it's very possible that we could see another false flag event, or any excuse that would give Bush and his administration a reason to declare a national state of emergency, would then plunge us into a horrible, horrible time in human history.
[00:07:25.049 --> 00:07:26.791]  And I think it's still possible to stop it.
[00:07:26.991 --> 00:07:27.731]  I want to believe that.
[00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:28.412]  I'm an optimist.
[00:07:29.434 --> 00:07:30.535]  I would like to believe so, anyway.
[00:07:49.878 --> 00:07:57.945]  What response have you gotten from people, A, in the whole Hollywood slash New York, Chicago scene?
[00:07:59.166 --> 00:08:04.090]  What response have you gotten from just the general public?
[00:08:04.671 --> 00:08:13.037]  And then, when you're talking to people, and I would imagine you warn them and make the same points you just made here.
[00:08:13.098 --> 00:08:14.339]  Hey, we've got to get the word out now.
[00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:16.000]  Hey, do you know about false flag terror?
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.342]  What do your colleagues say when you talk to them?
[00:08:19.014 --> 00:08:20.196]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:26.362]  There are a couple of my colleagues, people that I've actually worked with on Rescue Me, who at first were, you know, they...
[00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:29.196]  Listen to some of the information.
[00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:33.277]  They tried to, you know, their knee-jerk response was to start offering some excuses.
[00:08:33.317 --> 00:08:34.257]  Well, couldn't it have been that?
[00:08:34.318 --> 00:08:35.138]  And maybe it was this?
[00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:36.898]  And wouldn't everybody have had to have been in on it?
[00:08:36.918 --> 00:08:37.479]  What are you telling me?
[00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.900]  The whole government is in on this conspiracy?
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:51.884]  But after looking at the information a little bit more carefully, soberly kind of comparing the inconsistencies that are being highlighted by very credible experts,
[00:08:53.144 --> 00:08:55.646]  To the official story and what we have been told.
[00:08:56.326 --> 00:09:04.310]  Now there are a number of them who are starting to, who have come to me privately and are voicing their very deep concerns about 9-11.
[00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.631]  Some of these people are firefighters who work with us every day on the show.
[00:09:08.192 --> 00:09:10.833]  A couple of these people are actors who work with us on the show.
[00:09:12.254 --> 00:09:21.538]  But in my personal life, you know, some of the stuff that I've been doing aside from going on Lone Lantern and Resistance Radio and now coming on your show has been just hitting the streets.
[00:09:21.898 --> 00:09:30.924]  Just hitting the streets with leaflets, with DVDs, copies of Loose Change, or 9-11 Mysteries, or Terror Storm, and just, you know, passing out the information.
[00:09:31.645 --> 00:09:40.271]  Sometimes, you know, here in New York City, it's almost like a lot of times you feel like you're preaching to the choir when you're expressing these kind of views.
[00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:43.973]  Not necessarily about 9-11, but you know, it is a very blue state.
[00:09:44.854 --> 00:09:48.957]  But moving past the left-right paradigm, I think that a lot of people are
[00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:50.376]  I think so.
[00:10:17.373 --> 00:10:18.715]  Stay there, stay there Daniel.
[00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.137]  Daniel Sanjata is our guest.
[00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:22.138]  We're honored to have him.
[00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:26.241]  Just an amazing person, whether he wants you to know that or not, it's true.
[00:10:26.261 --> 00:10:27.422]  A lot of courage.
[00:10:28.303 --> 00:10:37.591]  One more individual charging the machine gun nest to try to stop these monsters, ladies and gentlemen, who are absolutely bloodthirsty and completely ruthless.
[00:10:37.831 --> 00:10:40.333]  They must be met with force of information.
[00:10:40.513 --> 00:10:41.114]  We'll be right back.
[00:10:44.162 --> 00:10:49.384]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:10:49.524 --> 00:10:57.626]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:04.928]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:11:05.188 --> 00:11:06.029]  I think so.
[00:11:35.353 --> 00:11:35.573]  888-803-4438.
[00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:40.597]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:42.158]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:44.099]  Gold.
[00:11:44.439 --> 00:11:45.740]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:52.085]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:56.088]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:11:56.428 --> 00:11:58.309]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:11:58.369 --> 00:12:00.611]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:12:00.811 --> 00:12:01.491]  We're good to go.
[00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:25.041]  We're good to go.
[00:12:43.707 --> 00:12:50.210]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:12:50.451 --> 00:12:54.433]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:12:54.713 --> 00:12:56.874]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:12:57.234 --> 00:13:04.278]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:13:04.578 --> 00:13:07.179]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:10.921]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:19.109]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:13:19.490 --> 00:13:21.011]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:33.164]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[00:13:33.665 --> 00:13:35.971]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[00:13:36.372 --> 00:13:41.747]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:13:45.259 --> 00:13:49.382]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:13:49.622 --> 00:13:51.383]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:13:51.643 --> 00:13:57.927]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:13:58.227 --> 00:14:04.311]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:14:04.591 --> 00:14:12.016]  The Biosolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions with no side effects.
[00:14:12.396 --> 00:14:17.319]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[00:14:17.459 --> 00:14:21.002]  Its easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[00:14:21.302 --> 00:14:25.024]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[00:14:25.204 --> 00:14:27.746]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:14:27.866 --> 00:14:28.927]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:14:29.087 --> 00:14:30.248]  Just eliminate the cause.
[00:14:30.388 --> 00:14:32.730]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll free 1-866-885-6625.
[00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.270]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.350]  1-866-885-6625.
[00:14:59.011 --> 00:15:00.472]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:01.052 --> 00:15:05.034]  It is Friday the 13th, but that's a lucky day for 9-11 Truth.
[00:15:05.954 --> 00:15:14.078]  Daniel Sanjata is our guest, and of course he is the main star, the big star on the FX hit program, Rescue Me.
[00:15:14.698 --> 00:15:19.200]  Continuing, talking to your friends, what's the response that you're getting?
[00:15:20.495 --> 00:15:27.980]  I've been getting more candid responses from people, you know, that I'm not approaching, let's say, at work, or strangers that I'm approaching on the street, you know, from friends and family.
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.663]  The response has been less self-censored, shall we say.
[00:15:33.403 --> 00:15:42.529]  Definitely, you know, most of them are completely on board once I actually point out the inconsistencies with the official story, or at least the ones that I've been able to memorize so far.
[00:15:42.569 --> 00:15:44.630]  I mean, there's so many thousands of them.
[00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:55.366]  You know, I also wanted to say, Alex, that I think it is actually perfect for people who happen to have a lot of baggage, let's just say, or maybe the way that they've lived their lives.
[00:15:55.967 --> 00:16:01.989]  It might be preventing them from actually coming out publicly about 9-11 because they're worried about ad hominem attempts at character assassination.
[00:16:02.589 --> 00:16:10.833]  I mean, one of the reasons, for instance, and you pointed this out maybe a week or two ago when Rosie first came out, it's perfect, it's absolutely perfect that she came out.
[00:16:11.113 --> 00:16:28.761]  Because they're going to, obviously, their MO is instead of addressing the actual points that she is trying to, that she's addressing, they will attack you on your past, on the fact that you happen to be maybe a celebrity and therefore why should you even open your mouth about anything of consequence.
[00:16:29.661 --> 00:16:52.948]  That is actually a perfect entree for us to redirect and to say, well, why is it every time we say something about partially evaporated steel columns in the wreckage of Building 7 or, you know, the law of falling bodies and how can buildings collapse at free-fall speed, why every time we bring up some piece of credible science, why do you say something about the fact that, you know, so-and-so happens to be, you know,
[00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:54.866]  We're good to go.
[00:17:08.306 --> 00:17:12.448]  So, you know, it really just makes them look complicit in an obvious cover-up.
[00:17:12.768 --> 00:17:15.089]  It doesn't lend any credibility to their denial.
[00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:15.850]  No, you're right.
[00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:20.032]  I mean, they can't help it, and it blows up completely in their face.
[00:17:20.092 --> 00:17:22.773]  But first off, I'm really honored to find out you're a listener.
[00:17:22.953 --> 00:17:23.834]  I didn't do any pre-interview.
[00:17:23.854 --> 00:17:26.195]  I've never talked to you before until you came on, Daniel.
[00:17:26.235 --> 00:17:27.996]  Alex, I'm a huge fan.
[00:17:28.116 --> 00:17:29.157]  I'm a huge fan of yours.
[00:17:29.377 --> 00:17:29.877]  Absolutely.
[00:17:30.774 --> 00:17:39.400]  Well, that just humbles me because it always shocks me how many people tune into this show to hear me bumble around in my redneck fashion, but thank you so much, my friend.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.822]  But no, I mean, you're absolutely right that
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:53.664]  They ignore it when physicists and scientists and underwriting laboratory engineers who underwrote the buildings come out and say it's a fraud and impossible and a hoax, because they have to.
[00:17:54.364 --> 00:17:58.286]  But still, they take the bait on celebrities because they can't ignore it.
[00:17:58.326 --> 00:17:59.186]  They blow it up.
[00:17:59.506 --> 00:18:03.007]  They try to chill free speech, and then that blows up in their face.
[00:18:03.067 --> 00:18:07.369]  I mean, just at certain levels, this New World Order is really incompetent.
[00:18:08.075 --> 00:18:08.315]  Yeah.
[00:18:08.596 --> 00:18:09.297]  Yeah, they really are.
[00:18:09.477 --> 00:18:09.957]  They really are.
[00:18:09.977 --> 00:18:14.843]  And I think it's that they're operating just on, you know, a really, really old paradigm.
[00:18:14.903 --> 00:18:15.384]  That's it!
[00:18:15.524 --> 00:18:15.904]  That's it!
[00:18:15.924 --> 00:18:18.327]  In terms of, you know, in terms of controlling the public mind.
[00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:27.058]  These are tactics that used to work, but they're not taking into account the telescoping of evolution and the fact that the human species is now beyond the point of their old methods of control.
[00:18:27.278 --> 00:18:28.679]  Wow, you just said that in a great way.
[00:18:28.699 --> 00:18:31.061]  The evolution of technology alone doubling every two years or even faster.
[00:18:45.431 --> 00:18:47.113]  And it's really just gotten away from them.
[00:18:47.133 --> 00:18:55.143]  I mean, they've got a lot of geniuses and high-tech people in their technocracy that I know are giving them new ways to control us, but these old elites are still making the decisions.
[00:18:55.423 --> 00:18:57.205]  I mean, literally, folks, and I'm not knocking old people.
[00:18:57.225 --> 00:18:57.806]  Old people are great.
[00:18:58.066 --> 00:19:02.251]  But it's like 85-year-olds, and I mean, Prince Bernhard was running most of this.
[00:19:02.831 --> 00:19:04.071]  I'm sorry folks, we're going to kick their butt!
[00:19:21.946 --> 00:19:22.566]  That's the truth.
[00:19:23.086 --> 00:19:25.247]  I mean, Alex, how are they marginalizing?
[00:19:25.307 --> 00:19:32.608]  How is it that they're able to prevent the opinions of people like Robert Bowman, Ray McGovern, Kevin Ryan, David Shaler, Stephen Jones?
[00:19:33.008 --> 00:19:38.249]  How are they able to keep such credible expert opinions completely marginalized?
[00:19:38.429 --> 00:19:39.129]  It's something that's hard.
[00:19:39.769 --> 00:19:45.350]  I work in the media, and it's hard for me to fathom how they can ignore what these people are saying.
[00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.710]  I can understand them ignoring me.
[00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.871]  I can understand them ignoring maybe even Rosie or Charlie or whoever.
[00:19:50.345 --> 00:20:07.248]  But when you have people who are obviously in the know, you have retired Air Force pilots, people who train the top guns, who are coming out and saying 9-11 was an inside job, and CNN, BBC, none of the major media news outlets are even giving this, you know, giving it even a moment of attention.
[00:20:07.288 --> 00:20:07.849]  How is that possible?
[00:20:08.743 --> 00:20:18.630]  You know what, when we get back, I'll try to give you my take on it, and I'll get your take, and we'll also take some calls.
[00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:19.210]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.531]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:20.251 --> 00:20:22.573]  And Daniel Sanjata is our guest.
[00:20:22.613 --> 00:20:25.875]  He is the star of the hit TV show on FX, Rescue Me.
[00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:30.098]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and this is the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:34.281 --> 00:20:35.161]  We're on the march.
[00:20:35.662 --> 00:20:37.163]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:20:38.178 --> 00:20:40.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.302]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[00:20:47.662 --> 00:20:50.664]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[00:20:50.964 --> 00:20:53.025]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[00:20:53.345 --> 00:20:57.688]  Now there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[00:20:57.968 --> 00:21:03.531]  SFR Green's Protector reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[00:21:04.051 --> 00:21:05.332]  So do something green.
[00:21:05.572 --> 00:21:09.715]  For a special offer with free shipping, go to GreenGasAdditive.com.

[00:21:15.077 --> 00:21:17.539]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[00:21:18.019 --> 00:21:19.921]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[00:21:20.642 --> 00:21:23.804]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[00:21:24.465 --> 00:21:30.950]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[00:21:31.711 --> 00:21:33.912]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:34.533]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:34.553 --> 00:21:35.013]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:44.085 --> 00:21:49.033]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:21:49.353 --> 00:21:51.236]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:21:51.416 --> 00:21:54.481]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:21:54.661 --> 00:21:57.806]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:21:58.086 --> 00:21:59.949]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:22:00.209 --> 00:22:03.910]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:22:04.190 --> 00:22:06.851]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:22:07.471 --> 00:22:11.732]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:16.254]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:22:16.654 --> 00:22:20.975]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[00:22:21.255 --> 00:22:21.515]  I think so.
[00:22:44.167 --> 00:22:48.169]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:51.831]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:22:52.011 --> 00:22:55.532]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:22:55.753 --> 00:22:59.014]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:22:59.034 --> 00:23:04.457]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we think.
[00:23:05.137 --> 00:23:05.838]  We're good to go.
[00:23:21.557 --> 00:23:26.002]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:23:26.022 --> 00:23:27.464]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:23:27.624 --> 00:23:31.088]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:23:31.108 --> 00:23:32.089]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:23:46.647 --> 00:23:52.689]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:23:53.290 --> 00:23:56.271]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:01.193 --> 00:24:04.414]  Wow, this is a really great interview.
[00:24:04.494 --> 00:24:12.837]  I enjoyed getting the perspectives and talking to Daniel Sanjata, who again has the hit TV show,
[00:24:13.613 --> 00:24:22.396]  One of the stars, one of the most popular stars out there on the hit TV show that's on FX, Rescue Me, where he plays the part of a firefighter.
[00:24:23.196 --> 00:24:25.837]  And they're in New York, I guess, producing the TV show.
[00:24:25.857 --> 00:24:29.478]  They have a chance to talk to a lot of the firefighters in New York.
[00:24:29.558 --> 00:24:38.921]  And I had this experience when I was in New York at several different memorial services over several different anniversaries.
[00:24:38.961 --> 00:24:40.642]  And I've been there to cover the RNC as well.
[00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:41.621]  Yes, sir.
[00:24:55.544 --> 00:24:59.445]  Literally, we're going, oh yeah, we know, and telling us all these facts and statistics and numbers.
[00:24:59.845 --> 00:25:01.325]  Most of the cops knew my name.
[00:25:01.365 --> 00:25:02.505]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[00:25:03.145 --> 00:25:03.726]  Keep it up.
[00:25:03.806 --> 00:25:05.886]  And then they'd turn away and smile at us.
[00:25:06.106 --> 00:25:07.246]  I mean, it was amazing.
[00:25:07.766 --> 00:25:10.667]  That's why I'm going to go back this sixth anniversary on 9-11.
[00:25:10.747 --> 00:25:14.067]  We're just going to have spontaneous demonstrations there on the morning of 9-11.
[00:25:14.368 --> 00:25:17.748]  Hope to see you all there, and I'm sure there'll be more events as well as that develops.
[00:25:18.448 --> 00:25:20.249]  Daniel, what were we talking about before we went to break?
[00:25:20.269 --> 00:25:22.309]  There was some point, and then you got cut off by the break.
[00:25:22.867 --> 00:25:39.284]  Yeah, I was just wondering, Alex, I mean, with your intimate knowledge of the way that the media works and the way that they try to manufacture consent-bound debate, etc., etc., how is it possible that they're marginalizing the opinions of such credible experts as, you know, Robert Bauman, Ray McGovern, and the list goes on?
[00:25:39.324 --> 00:25:43.128]  I mean, people who actually are in the know and whose opinions should be listened to.
[00:25:43.448 --> 00:25:46.071]  Again, I said before we went to the break, I can understand them.
[00:25:46.471 --> 00:26:03.361]  Ignoring somebody like me or marginalizing somebody like Rosie O'Donnell or Charlie Sheen, even though they shouldn't, but when it comes to the people who come from the institutions, that people who worked inside the system, who are coming out publicly saying 9-11 was an inside job, how can they ignore those opinions?
[00:26:03.541 --> 00:26:04.502]  I just don't understand that.
[00:26:04.602 --> 00:26:09.885]  Well, Operation Mockingbird, number one, because
[00:26:11.278 --> 00:26:18.008]  Going back to the 50s, we have the CIA documents where they brag about how they already controlled almost all the major newspapers.
[00:26:18.048 --> 00:26:22.354]  All you've got to do is have the editor of the New York Times, the editor of the Washington Post,
[00:26:23.415 --> 00:26:25.717]  Or the sub-editors at those key papers.
[00:26:25.757 --> 00:26:26.878]  You'll have a whole nest of them.
[00:26:27.298 --> 00:26:28.759]  Key people inside CNN.
[00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:30.421]  I mean, at Fox, it's open.
[00:26:30.461 --> 00:26:38.787]  You've got, on the board of directors, Viet Dinh, who wrote the first Patriot Act and contributed to torture memos.
[00:26:39.387 --> 00:26:40.968]  I mean, at Fox, it's just open.
[00:26:41.008 --> 00:26:46.413]  You've got Tony Snow with the revolving door as the White House Press Secretary, former Fox contributor.
[00:26:46.673 --> 00:26:48.534]  He co-hosts the Rush Limbaugh program.
[00:26:50.347 --> 00:26:57.236]  You've got fellow travelers with the elite system on the left and the right who are all controlled by the same private corporate structures.
[00:26:57.596 --> 00:26:58.878]  Then you've got CIA.
[00:26:59.238 --> 00:27:01.441]  Then you've got thousands of top reporters.
[00:27:02.443 --> 00:27:03.043]  We're good to go.
[00:27:21.992 --> 00:27:31.034]  After he got out of the military from the Defense Department in a CIA contract to go around talking about how martial law is coming, but you know that's what we have to have.
[00:27:31.094 --> 00:27:31.794]  It's too bad.
[00:27:31.814 --> 00:27:33.134]  I mean, that's chilling, folks.
[00:27:33.154 --> 00:27:36.255]  They paid him to go out and say that on all these TV shows.
[00:27:36.575 --> 00:27:38.576]  And at the time, I said, that guy's a spook.
[00:27:38.596 --> 00:27:43.117]  I mean, I saw him on the cover of Cigar Aficionado, you know, wearing CIA cufflinks.
[00:27:43.137 --> 00:27:44.777]  I mean, it's a big joke to these people.
[00:27:45.457 --> 00:27:47.239]  And they think it's all real funny.
[00:27:47.659 --> 00:27:50.642]  And then you've got others who just don't even really consciously think about it.
[00:27:50.882 --> 00:28:05.594]  Hey, Armstrong Williams, we want you to take $240-something thousand dollars just to go say as a black conservative that you're for Head Start, which is really just a big government program to CPS the kids.
[00:28:05.674 --> 00:28:08.536]  Sounds good, you know, to help the kids, but still it's big government.
[00:28:08.576 --> 00:28:09.417]  Why is Bush doing it?
[00:28:09.457 --> 00:28:11.238]  Well, it's corporate welfare.
[00:28:11.278 --> 00:28:11.759]  It's control.
[00:28:12.379 --> 00:28:15.162]  But the point is, that's the lighter end of it.
[00:28:15.642 --> 00:28:20.487]  I mean, $1.8 billion just in fake news for the prescription drug program.
[00:28:21.788 --> 00:28:26.212]  I added up, just propaganda, in the first four years of his administration, the contracts we can find.
[00:28:26.572 --> 00:28:28.574]  Almost $25 billion in fake news.
[00:28:29.114 --> 00:28:30.576]  Brother, that's how they're doing it.
[00:28:30.816 --> 00:28:39.683]  But when a star comes out, they know that they can't contain that, even in the alternative media or in some of the B-tier and C-tier tabloids.
[00:28:40.244 --> 00:28:52.595]  So they go ahead and try to use that as kind of a cultural zeitgeist to demonize it, because they know there's a subconscious envy and general hatred in the public, a love-hate relationship of anyone who's celebrity.
[00:28:53.535 --> 00:28:58.539]  It's hard to even describe how this whole thing is this big cauldron that mixes together, but basically it's being steered
[00:29:14.228 --> 00:29:19.311]  And then of course the big corporate chiefs, a lot of them may have an editor under them who's CIA.
[00:29:19.531 --> 00:29:30.817]  They're not CIA, they're members of the CFR, where they all just get on the same... because they have so many intersecting agendas in their empires that they have to get together and basically try to steer everything.
[00:29:31.137 --> 00:29:33.259]  I mean, that's kind of a nutshell.
[00:29:33.279 --> 00:29:33.899]  Give me your take.
[00:29:34.759 --> 00:29:47.291]  You know, to be honest, the reason why I asked you, Alex, is because I really am having a hard time understanding, and it's hard for me to conceive how, you know, without the inside knowledge that you have, as I said, of the way that the inner workings of the media
[00:29:48.414 --> 00:29:48.714]  Thank you.
[00:30:12.487 --> 00:30:15.851]  The American free press needs to be absolutely ashamed of themselves.
[00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:31.326]  The fact that they can just ignore these things, or if they do address them, address them in such an obviously biased and twisted way, really just, this is, to me, this is an eye-opener, because I really, I was aware of the manufacturer of consent, borrowing a title from Noam Chomsky.
[00:30:31.346 --> 00:30:34.689]  I know you're not a big fan of his, and I'm starting to have serious questions about him myself now.
[00:30:35.351 --> 00:30:41.359]  Well no, I mean I read two of his books, I watched one of his videos, I read a lot of his papers.
[00:30:41.379 --> 00:30:46.105]  I mean if somebody tells me 95% truth but then gives me
[00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:49.461]  False solutions?
[00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:51.642]  You know, the UN is going to save us.
[00:30:51.702 --> 00:30:55.785]  Well, I'm sure there are good people at the UN who mean well at the mid-level and the low-level.
[00:30:55.825 --> 00:30:56.766]  It's like the Red Cross.
[00:30:56.846 --> 00:30:58.687]  I'm not against the Red Cross itself.
[00:30:59.187 --> 00:31:00.208]  There are good people in it.
[00:31:00.288 --> 00:31:10.254]  The leadership is corrupt and knowingly collected blood with AIDS and hepatitis in it and knowingly sold it for blood products, you know, and knowingly steals a lot of the money for themselves.
[00:31:11.966 --> 00:31:14.451]  Noam Chomsky puts out a lot of good info.
[00:31:14.812 --> 00:31:17.276]  It's just that when it comes to 9-11, I've got a clip of him.
[00:31:17.296 --> 00:31:18.318]  He said, so what?
[00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:19.601]  Even if it's true, so what?
[00:31:20.228 --> 00:31:21.669]  Well, what is he talking about?
[00:31:21.829 --> 00:31:22.289]  I saw that.
[00:31:22.329 --> 00:31:23.430]  That was a jaw-dropper.
[00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:25.091]  I couldn't believe he said that.
[00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:28.454]  Because, I mean, I had read a number of his books.
[00:31:28.534 --> 00:31:33.137]  I had seen his most famous documentary, Manufacturing Consent, and some others.
[00:31:33.677 --> 00:31:38.881]  And once I started doing my own 9-11 research, immediately I was like, oh, I wonder what Noam Chomsky has to say about this.
[00:31:38.921 --> 00:31:42.443]  He's probably going to have something scintillating, something penetrating to say about it.
[00:31:42.823 --> 00:31:44.945]  And to hear him say that it doesn't matter.
[00:31:44.965 --> 00:31:46.326]  I mean, I was like, what?
[00:31:46.626 --> 00:31:48.047]  Does he really mean that?
[00:31:48.826 --> 00:31:49.947]  Who does this guy work for?
[00:31:50.027 --> 00:31:52.510]  Whose book am I reading?
[00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:56.574]  He knows 9-11 truth threatens the entire structure.
[00:31:56.594 --> 00:32:05.243]  And you see the left, a lot of these guys are elitist, but they delude themselves so they can sleep with themselves at night so they can get rest, so they don't feel guilty.
[00:32:05.743 --> 00:32:18.756]  Well, yeah, there is always an elite, but we need a loving, guided, you know, kind of Plato elite that understands, and then they just argue over who's going to run the power levers, you see.
[00:32:21.132 --> 00:32:36.325]  Well, you know, I think that's one of the reasons why it's really important that we have people like you doing the work you're doing, other people that you often mention on your show, Gary Franchi at Lone Lantern, Mark Dice with his Resistance Radio, Aaron Russo coming out and making these very important films.
[00:32:36.747 --> 00:32:46.955]  I mean, it really is important that people, as you've said a number of times, stop waiting for orders from headquarters and just join this leaderless resistance of spreading the truth.
[00:32:47.055 --> 00:32:56.223]  I mean, 9-11 is a watershed issue for so many reasons, not the least of which is the larger issues towards which it points, and it's a perfect
[00:32:56.343 --> 00:32:58.864]  You know, they really left themselves overexposed here.
[00:32:59.145 --> 00:33:01.326]  They really, really did with this particular thing.
[00:33:01.366 --> 00:33:07.409]  I think their hubris got the best of them, and we now, you know, it's that proverbial soft spot on the belly of the dragon.
[00:33:07.689 --> 00:33:17.715]  We have to take this opportunity to reveal this horrific truth so that we can then go forward and dismantle all these other horrific truths of which this is but the most obvious precursor.
[00:33:18.095 --> 00:33:23.080]  I totally agree, but there's also a converse, or the reverse of that, or I guess the mirror image of that.
[00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:42.397]  Not only use 9-11 to break up on all the other truths, but if you go, okay, did the government let black men die of, and the evidence shows gave them syphilis when they didn't have enough test subjects, and then allowed them to spread it to literally hundreds of thousands with the Tuskegee experiment over 45 years in Tuskegee, Alabama, and surrounding states.
[00:33:42.857 --> 00:33:46.664]  Did the government radiate tens of thousands of American children in nuclear testing?
[00:33:47.445 --> 00:33:50.370]  Did they know Agent Orange would do this and they still used it?
[00:33:51.111 --> 00:33:52.834]  Did they, in Operation
[00:33:53.775 --> 00:33:59.817]  Gladio, and Gulf of Tonkin, and with the USS Liberty, and Ajax, and Iran.
[00:34:00.078 --> 00:34:03.199]  Did our government stage attacks or claim attacks that didn't happen?
[00:34:03.459 --> 00:34:08.221]  You see, there's so many admissions in history where this has already gone on.
[00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:09.701]  That's what I do with my film Terror Storm.
[00:34:10.161 --> 00:34:18.244]  I don't know if you've seen that film, but we start out, Daniel, showing, for those that haven't seen it, showing the admitted examples.
[00:34:18.425 --> 00:34:19.385]  What did you think of Terror Storm?
[00:34:19.785 --> 00:34:20.865]  I thought it was fantastic.
[00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:33.827]  I mean, you know, and one of the reasons why it's so important is that it gives you, it shows the precedent setting either events or plans that have been made but were not actually carried out, as in the case with Operation Northwood.
[00:34:34.187 --> 00:34:43.349]  It just speaks to, you know, the types of minds that we are dealing with, the kind of things that they will either do or that they will entertain doing in order to advance an agenda.
[00:34:43.569 --> 00:34:46.049]  And it does not stop short of murdering civilians.
[00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.810]  It does not stop short of attacking soft targets.
[00:34:49.230 --> 00:35:02.124]  You know, as you say, firefighters carrying dead children in their arms, as in the case of the Oklahoma City bombing, is something that does get the public really, really upset and willing to do almost anything to protect what they perceive to be security.
[00:35:03.585 --> 00:35:04.947]  So you've looked at Oklahoma.
[00:35:05.007 --> 00:35:06.028]  What's your view on that?
[00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:19.896]  Um, you know, I don't want to... I actually have not done even a tenth of the research on the Oklahoma City bombing as I have done on 9-11, so I'm afraid I can't really speak with any real, you know, with a very informed opinion on that.
[00:35:19.916 --> 00:35:20.936]  But you've got questions.
[00:35:21.496 --> 00:35:22.877]  Oh, serious questions.
[00:35:23.117 --> 00:35:23.937]  Serious questions.
[00:35:23.977 --> 00:35:24.998]  I mean, starting with the...
[00:35:25.838 --> 00:35:37.782]  Following the pattern that I, uh, the path that I took with 9-11, I started in the Oklahoma City bombing, uh, my research regarding that with, um, just the physical inconsistencies, the physical evidence.
[00:35:38.082 --> 00:35:46.145]  You know, how does a truck filled with fertilizer, uh, you know, create the kind of damage that you saw there in the wreckage of the Oklahoma City bombing?
[00:35:46.705 --> 00:35:53.267]  Uh, what about, uh, I don't remember the woman, her name, but you mentioned that there was a woman who worked in the building who saw these guys dressed up in, you know, uh,
[00:35:54.048 --> 00:35:56.749]  I don't know, hazmat suits or something with sticks of grey butter?
[00:35:56.969 --> 00:35:58.950]  Yeah, Jane Graham.
[00:35:59.430 --> 00:36:05.291]  You know, again, I haven't done a lot of research into that, but it sounds just as suspicious in many of the very same ways.
[00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:09.533]  You can see the same fingerprints all over that job as we find all over the 9-11.
[00:36:09.613 --> 00:36:13.554]  Well, I mean, the point I made yesterday is really elementary, but it needs to be made again.
[00:36:14.509 --> 00:36:23.512]  I mean, a lot of us don't consciously think about the different mindset of the military leadership, and that's definitely the type of MO, the type of individuals we're talking about.
[00:36:23.912 --> 00:36:33.816]  I mean, they'll send 10-20,000 troops into a battle, into a position that's untenable or undefended, just to suck in the enemy to attack them.
[00:36:34.455 --> 00:36:36.557]  I mean, that's just a 101.
[00:36:36.938 --> 00:36:38.319]  No guilt goes into it.
[00:36:38.399 --> 00:36:39.781]  No thought goes into it.
[00:36:40.461 --> 00:36:41.743]  No remorse goes into it.
[00:36:41.783 --> 00:36:42.683]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:36:42.984 --> 00:36:44.125]  It's military tactics.
[00:36:44.185 --> 00:36:46.527]  It's what you do in big battle settings.
[00:36:47.048 --> 00:36:49.851]  And so, for that same mindset, those same individuals,
[00:36:50.391 --> 00:36:50.731]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.183]  Wow, it's just such a, you know, it really is, even at this point for me, such a hard pill to swallow.
[00:37:17.463 --> 00:37:24.549]  But, you know, no matter how much my, uh, there's a certain part of me that reacts against this daunting knowledge.
[00:37:24.989 --> 00:37:26.711]  I cannot ignore.
[00:37:26.831 --> 00:37:33.956]  Well, that's number one, because your subconscious, and the same with me, I'm not saying you're afraid, but your subconscious senses the danger, and you, like, pull back from the flame.
[00:37:33.976 --> 00:37:41.222]  The only way to defeat this flame is to grab it and smother it, and it's going to hurt at first, but we're going to be consumed by it if we don't, so we've got to just grapple with it.
[00:37:41.582 --> 00:37:43.885]  And then secondarily, you wouldn't behave like that.
[00:37:43.945 --> 00:37:45.446]  That isn't in your code.
[00:37:45.486 --> 00:37:46.968]  That isn't in your heart and soul.
[00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:48.569]  And so it's just so alien.
[00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:57.499]  But I mean, it's alien to think that Ted Bundy would convince young women to get in the car with him so he could go tie them down and bite chunks out of them for five hours before he raped them and killed them.
[00:37:58.024 --> 00:37:59.145]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:37:59.225 --> 00:38:06.092]  You know, it's really hard to believe that there are people out there in the world like that, and you don't want to believe that they have their hands on the reins of power of your country.
[00:38:06.672 --> 00:38:09.635]  But that is the horrible reality to which we are waking up.
[00:38:09.955 --> 00:38:13.319]  But for them it isn't, you know, the enjoyment of, I guess, biting the chunks out.
[00:38:13.339 --> 00:38:15.501]  I mean, certainly some of them have that same mindset.
[00:38:15.521 --> 00:38:16.442]  It's just cold-blooded.
[00:38:17.002 --> 00:38:18.423]  You know, we always sacrifice people.
[00:38:18.664 --> 00:38:20.005]  There's too many of them anyways, you know.
[00:38:20.643 --> 00:38:22.084]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:38:22.144 --> 00:38:23.725]  According to some people.
[00:38:23.906 --> 00:38:24.986]  Well, that's their whole religion.
[00:38:25.006 --> 00:38:28.269]  I mean, when you study Prince Bernhard and Philip and all this scum.
[00:38:28.469 --> 00:38:29.530]  Let's take a quick call here.
[00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:30.571]  Let's talk to George.
[00:38:31.051 --> 00:38:32.512]  George, where are you calling us from today?
[00:38:33.633 --> 00:38:34.494]  I'm from Indiana.
[00:38:34.854 --> 00:38:35.154]  Welcome.
[00:38:35.174 --> 00:38:36.775]  You're on the air with our guest.
[00:38:37.076 --> 00:38:37.456]  Go ahead.
[00:38:38.036 --> 00:38:38.717]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:38:39.658 --> 00:38:43.561]  Three things on 9-11 I was wondering, or two things on 9-11 and then a comment.
[00:38:44.581 --> 00:38:47.243]  Did they ever have any more information on the stolen 9-11 steal?
[00:38:50.624 --> 00:39:01.254]  Well, I mean, they cut it all up, put GPS trackers on it, wouldn't let the people stop to even have lunch when they took it to the ships, and most of it was taken to China, some to South Korea.
[00:39:02.215 --> 00:39:11.884]  But now they found some in warehouses the government kept for some reason, and we've been able to get samples from those, and that shows that the explosive compounds in there are thermate.
[00:39:11.904 --> 00:39:13.526]  Do you want to comment on that, Daniel?
[00:39:14.311 --> 00:39:15.413]  I don't know much about it.
[00:39:16.654 --> 00:39:18.135]  Actually, it's new information to me.
[00:39:18.195 --> 00:39:22.500]  The fact that they've actually found samples that were kept certainly fits the MO of criminals.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.881]  You know, they just can't help themselves.
[00:39:23.901 --> 00:39:26.284]  They have to keep some trinket of their, you know... Trophy.
[00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:29.487]  Yeah, some kind of trophy from the murder.
[00:39:31.437 --> 00:39:39.305]  Yeah, you know, Alex, have those samples that have been found actually, have we been, for example, has Professor Stephen Jones been given access to those samples?
[00:39:39.786 --> 00:39:40.707]  Well, let me be clear.
[00:39:41.388 --> 00:39:42.669]  Yeah, there were several sites.
[00:39:42.689 --> 00:39:44.231]  There's over 20 of them in the country.
[00:39:44.511 --> 00:39:46.193]  One, I'll just tell you, is in Michigan.
[00:39:46.273 --> 00:39:47.634]  Another's in New Jersey.
[00:39:48.035 --> 00:39:48.936]  Another's in New York.
[00:39:48.956 --> 00:39:50.898]  He's gotten lots of other samples, and some of them
[00:39:51.258 --> 00:39:51.759]  Sure, sure, sure.
[00:40:11.807 --> 00:40:28.675]  I know doing an autopsy now might be difficult to see if there was thermite or thermate left in a body, but they could resume a dog and do an autopsy on that dog and see if there's thermite in the lung of that dog that had to breathe it.
[00:40:30.856 --> 00:40:35.578]  There were femur bones blown 100, 200 yards plus.
[00:40:36.019 --> 00:40:37.359]  They found thousands of body parts.
[00:40:37.379 --> 00:40:39.120]  They just found more last week, the week before that.
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.042]  I mean, bones were being blasted out of bodies.
[00:40:42.082 --> 00:40:43.362]  These explosions were so big.
[00:40:43.862 --> 00:40:47.164]  Again, if a building collapses, number one, it wouldn't fly out hundreds of yards.
[00:40:47.524 --> 00:40:50.466]  Number two, it wouldn't all be burned to a crisp.
[00:40:51.366 --> 00:40:54.988]  And so all there was was little bitty body parts, a few pieces that got
[00:40:55.669 --> 00:40:59.211]  Excuse me, even talking about this for family members that listen, you know, blown across the street.
[00:40:59.731 --> 00:41:00.952]  I mean, it's just like Oklahoma City.
[00:41:00.972 --> 00:41:09.996]  You got a truck bomb that supposedly blows into the building, but the building blows out and blows chunks of it the opposite direction of the truck bomb's main blast on top of buildings across the street.
[00:41:10.917 --> 00:41:15.599]  I mean, it's just, it's just, it's so sloppy how they do this, but again, they count on us
[00:41:16.545 --> 00:41:17.786]  Just buying into all of it.
[00:41:17.806 --> 00:41:18.507]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:18.587 --> 00:41:22.429]  Rory, you're up next, and we can keep our guests another five minutes into the next segment.
[00:41:22.489 --> 00:41:24.291]  We'll take a few more calls, then let him go.
[00:41:24.331 --> 00:41:26.492]  I've got to get him up again in the near future.
[00:41:26.572 --> 00:41:31.416]  I know he's a very busy individual, and Daniel Sanjata is his name.
[00:41:31.436 --> 00:41:37.000]  You can check out his TV program right there on the FX Channel on cable.
[00:41:37.060 --> 00:41:38.141]  It's called Rescue Me.
[00:41:38.501 --> 00:41:39.442]  We'll be right back.
[00:41:46.875 --> 00:41:47.356]  It's here.
[00:41:47.556 --> 00:41:52.300]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:42:00.347]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:42:01.047 --> 00:42:08.090]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:19.915]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:42:20.235 --> 00:42:23.737]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:42:24.197 --> 00:42:26.138]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:42:26.458 --> 00:42:30.300]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:42:43.698 --> 00:42:44.479]  Terrorism.
[00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:45.379]  Terrorism.
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:51.524]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:42:51.785 --> 00:42:53.386]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:42:53.626 --> 00:42:56.108]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:42:56.488 --> 00:43:11.060]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:11.420]  government.
[00:43:11.601 --> 00:43:13.322]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:43:13.542 --> 00:43:19.686]  Yes, it's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:43:19.806 --> 00:43:24.289]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:43:45.278 --> 00:43:48.978]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:43:49.299 --> 00:43:51.519]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:43:52.019 --> 00:43:58.221]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:43:58.381 --> 00:44:03.262]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[00:44:03.482 --> 00:44:12.510]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:44:44.258 --> 00:44:49.823]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:45:05.872 --> 00:45:11.074]  Well, hopefully, next time I'm up in New York, I'll get a chance to meet Daniel Sanjata in person.
[00:45:11.154 --> 00:45:14.795]  Just, you can tell what a personable and intelligent fella he is.
[00:45:15.575 --> 00:45:17.516]  And why he's got all the girls swooning over him.
[00:45:18.176 --> 00:45:20.696]  One of the People Magazine, one of the best-looking people in America.
[00:45:21.097 --> 00:45:22.417]  I just thought I'd throw that out there.
[00:45:22.437 --> 00:45:24.337]  Talk about total pop, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:25.218 --> 00:45:30.039]  But you can... Daniel, before we take a few final calls, how do folks tune into your television show?
[00:45:30.752 --> 00:45:36.356]  Our show, again, I just want to say, and I know you know this, Alex, I didn't really come on the show to necessarily plug Rescue Me.
[00:45:36.576 --> 00:45:37.197]  But why not?
[00:45:37.777 --> 00:45:50.306]  Well, I mean, it's... The show, when we come back on the air, I believe it's Tuesday nights at 9 or 10, and sometimes, you know, listings change, so I would, I guess, tell your viewers to, I guess, check their local listings or what have you.
[00:45:50.874 --> 00:46:07.804]  But, you know, I think that it has, in terms of most of what's on television, I think that there's an inherent social relevance to Rescue Me's premise, and I would love to see them address this directly, although, you know, as FX is a subsidiary of Fox, I don't know if that will happen necessarily.
[00:46:08.284 --> 00:46:11.045]  And you're Rocco on the show, for those who don't know.
[00:46:11.466 --> 00:46:12.406]  Yeah, Franco, Franco.
[00:46:12.546 --> 00:46:13.867]  Franco, I was going for memory.
[00:46:13.907 --> 00:46:15.008]  Franco Rocco, it's okay.
[00:46:15.028 --> 00:46:17.329]  Yeah, I don't watch a lot of TV myself.
[00:46:17.884 --> 00:46:27.629]  But yeah, that's when our show comes on, and I just hope that the fact that we're representing these guys on television will lend some, maybe draw somebody's attention.
[00:46:28.009 --> 00:46:41.956]  And if they hear me say something about 9-11 being an inside job, I really hope they'll do their own research, that they'll go to InfoWars.com, that they'll pick up a copy of Terror Storm, or 9-11 Mysteries, or any of the great documentaries that have been made exposing the inside job that 9-11 obviously was.
[00:46:43.479 --> 00:46:44.260]  Well, fantastic.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.022]  I totally agree with you.
[00:46:45.824 --> 00:46:46.745]  One last question.
[00:46:46.966 --> 00:46:47.928]  I should ask this before.
[00:46:48.188 --> 00:46:49.251]  When did you wake up to 9-11?
[00:46:50.461 --> 00:46:51.801]  You know, it didn't happen immediately.
[00:46:51.861 --> 00:47:02.004]  You know, my best friend, Joey, he actually, on the day, was like, that looked like an inside... He didn't say it looked like an inside job, but he said, these buildings look like those things were brought down by controlled demolition.
[00:47:02.304 --> 00:47:04.145]  He said it from the very beginning, and I was like, no.
[00:47:04.465 --> 00:47:13.307]  I mean, I kind of thought that it was just... I had known... I knew at that point about America's horrific history in terms of our foreign, military, and economic policy, and I kind of looked at it
[00:47:13.867 --> 00:47:16.170]  Uh, as chickens coming home to roost in a certain sense.
[00:47:16.731 --> 00:47:19.394]  Uh, even the targets made sense from that perspective.
[00:47:19.794 --> 00:47:23.739]  But over time, you know, I would hear a little bit of this, I'd hear a little bit of that.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.483]  And I started, you know, the concern started welling up within me.
[00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:32.589]  And I don't remember the exact moment, but it was something about Charlie Sheen having come out publicly.
[00:47:34.191 --> 00:47:38.754]  And then, you know, it's kind of a confluence of circumstances and coincidences.
[00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:43.756]  I also remember you appearing in one of my favorite films by Richard Linklater, Waking Life.
[00:47:43.776 --> 00:47:52.141]  I didn't even know who you were when I saw the film, but in hindsight, when I was putting all these pieces together, I was like, oh, that was Alex Jones.
[00:47:52.201 --> 00:47:56.623]  And then I, you know, listened to the radio that you conducted with Charlie, and it kind of took off from there for me.
[00:47:56.683 --> 00:47:58.124]  I started then doing my own research.
[00:48:00.265 --> 00:48:06.491]  Well, what you're telling us dovetails and fits perfectly with the paradigm I've seen.
[00:48:06.972 --> 00:48:15.060]  It was the time Charlie came along, it was 9-11 Truth had already grown to, and people really resonated with his courage because of his baggage and other things.
[00:48:15.721 --> 00:48:21.267]  Knowing that he had a lot to lose doing this, and it really did trigger a chain reaction
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.401]  And then it was his idea to have the conference.
[00:48:23.421 --> 00:48:26.682]  That got put on C-SPAN four times, built up a big audience by the fourth showing.
[00:48:27.282 --> 00:48:28.543]  All the other things that happened.
[00:48:29.223 --> 00:48:34.305]  And that's now caused Rosie and Ebersole and so many others to go public.
[00:48:34.485 --> 00:48:35.225]  And me.
[00:48:35.625 --> 00:48:37.086]  And Brolin and yourself.
[00:48:37.946 --> 00:48:41.648]  And then now all these pilots and all these CIA people and all these other folks.
[00:48:42.548 --> 00:48:45.369]  There is a mass exodus out of a lie into the truth.
[00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:51.552]  And again, sir, I think you're actually early on in the avalanche that we're going to be seeing.
[00:48:51.572 --> 00:48:56.195]  It looks like an avalanche now, but I assure you, if things continue, it's going to be even bigger.
[00:48:56.555 --> 00:49:01.317]  So, Daniel, I really want to thank you for coming on with us, and I look forward to talking to you again in the near future.
[00:49:01.777 --> 00:49:02.218]  Absolutely.
[00:49:02.238 --> 00:49:04.759]  Thank you for having me, Alex, and God bless you for all the work you're doing.
[00:49:04.799 --> 00:49:05.159]  Be well.
[00:49:05.419 --> 00:49:06.040]  God bless you.
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:11.122]  I'm going to put you on hold here and give you a phone number here in a second for William Rodriguez, because he would like to talk to you.
[00:49:11.402 --> 00:49:12.163]  Again, thank you, Daniel.
[00:49:13.203 --> 00:49:15.427]  Daniel Sanjato spent an hour with us.
[00:49:15.447 --> 00:49:16.128]  We appreciate it.
[00:49:16.369 --> 00:49:18.172]  All right, I promise I'll get your calls out of the way.
[00:49:18.192 --> 00:49:18.913]  Been holding a while.
[00:49:19.153 --> 00:49:21.036]  We start the next hour, then I'll cover tons of news.
[00:49:21.337 --> 00:49:21.737]  Stay with me.
