[00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:06.376]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:08.117]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:09.938]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:11.379]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.060]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:17.404]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:21.967]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:42.165]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:42.925]  Welcome.
[00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:54.968]  It is the 11th day already of May 2007, and we're going to be live here for the next three hours on this Friday edition.
[00:00:55.568 --> 00:00:57.808]  Then coming up this Sunday from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:00:57.868 --> 00:01:04.330]  Central on Mother's Day, I'll be live in studio doing the Sunday edition of this broadcast as well.
[00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:09.020]  Very important news here in the stack in front of us today.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.061]  Let me go over some of it.
[00:01:10.762 --> 00:01:24.959]  But first, we have Dr. Nick Begich joining us for a full hour, maybe even longer, coming up in the second hour today to talk about mind control, the honeybees, what's happening with them.
[00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:35.853]  What's developing with the high-tech drone armies of aircraft that are going to be deployed over the US, Canada, and the rest of Europe and Russia.
[00:01:35.873 --> 00:01:38.974]  In fact, they're already being deployed in the last few years.
[00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:48.118]  Just a host of technology issues with one of the leading experts in the world on general knowledge, wide-spectrum analysis.
[00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:51.919]  And we'll get into the Virginia shooting and a lot more.
[00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:59.125]  With GCN's own Dr. Nick Begich coming up in the second hour today.
[00:02:00.606 --> 00:02:05.330]  In the meantime, I heard about this a few days ago.
[00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.791]  I heard D.B.
[00:02:06.831 --> 00:02:15.837]  Kidd doing a radio interview on another show and she was talking about seeing this video and I made a mental note to watch it but then never did.
[00:02:17.038 --> 00:02:20.761]  And then yesterday I finally got a chance to see the video.
[00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:22.422]  It's in
[00:02:24.642 --> 00:02:28.645]  Washington State and Seattle, the illegal aliens have taken over downtown.
[00:02:29.746 --> 00:02:34.009]  Literally, the traffic is, it was on the news is how we know, backed up for hours.
[00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:40.953]  And I'll bet my bottom dollar, assessing this guy's car, assessing him, that he's somebody who had to get to work.
[00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:45.957]  And he starts flipping them off after they've been blocking traffic for a while.
[00:02:46.497 --> 00:02:50.220]  Something the illegals are doing, yelling, screaming, flipping off, you know, enjoying themselves.
[00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:53.182]  We've all seen the video, the general enjoyment.
[00:02:53.903 --> 00:03:04.552]  And the police come over and drag him out of the car and start banging his face in the concrete until his nose and lips are a massive... I mean, the blood is just pouring out quite nicely.
[00:03:04.572 --> 00:03:09.176]  It's like several faucets, small faucets, pouring forth.
[00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:11.958]  And there's giggling, there's celebrations.
[00:03:12.338 --> 00:03:17.843]  The illegals come right up by the body with the police and have a general celebration of the death of America.
[00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:20.406]  And I'm serious when I say that.
[00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:22.867]  All these videos are all just snapshots.
[00:03:23.227 --> 00:03:26.930]  I've seen stuff, frankly, far worse, but I've never been able to catch it on tape.
[00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.931]  You know, a camera guy is walking off in the wrong direction.
[00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:29.711]  You know what I mean?
[00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:30.912]  There's no way just to catch it all.
[00:03:31.532 --> 00:03:37.676]  You know, I took a video of Luke Rodowski a few weeks ago, where the cops walk up and say, we're going to say you've got a bomb.
[00:03:38.156 --> 00:03:39.957]  We know you don't have one, but you're going to go to jail.
[00:03:40.798 --> 00:03:43.079]  So stop protesting, or we're going to say you've got a bomb.
[00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:44.780]  It's basically what they say.
[00:03:45.453 --> 00:03:51.518]  I mean, now that it'd be like a cop opening up his jacket, pulling out cocaine in front of a camera and saying, I'm going to plant this on you.
[00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:54.020]  Lookie what we got here!
[00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.221]  Everybody saw he had it!
[00:03:58.123 --> 00:03:59.124]  It's a new level.
[00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:04.508]  So, I'm going to first go over this article that's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:06.910]  Illegal immigrants are above the law.
[00:04:08.172 --> 00:04:27.547]  While American citizens, be they white, black, or hispanic, are shoved around, watched, brutalized by a police state that affords protection only to criminals, whether they be George Bush, Alberto Gonzalez, Michael Chertoff, or the 30-plus million illegal aliens.
[00:04:27.647 --> 00:04:30.209]  And if the globalists get amnesty, the country is done.
[00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:30.669]  It's over.
[00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.072]  We then have to go into simple defense mode.
[00:04:37.125 --> 00:04:39.106]  And there's nowhere to evacuate to, by the way.
[00:04:42.308 --> 00:04:49.611]  Alright, um... Well, I guess we get a temp to recruit the illegals, but the race consciousness is just too strong.
[00:04:50.812 --> 00:04:54.414]  They haven't been politically correct brainwashed yet.
[00:04:54.974 --> 00:04:57.095]  They've still got their tribal drive, and...
[00:05:04.605 --> 00:05:10.048]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.408 --> 00:05:18.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave the world.
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.824]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.204 --> 00:05:37.630]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.612]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.834]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:44.174 --> 00:05:47.996]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:01.181 --> 00:06:06.485]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey solar charger.
[00:06:06.685 --> 00:06:08.767]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:06:09.007 --> 00:06:16.132]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:06:16.252 --> 00:06:27.780]  The Berkey solar charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[00:06:28.161 --> 00:06:29.862]  It's multi-voltage capabilities,
[00:06:30.182 --> 00:06:35.544]  Multiple adapters and rechargeable batteries provide for flexible source of auxiliary backup power.
[00:06:35.804 --> 00:06:40.805]  Simply place the Berkey Solar Charger in the sun, plug in your application, and you have power.

[00:07:03.173 --> 00:07:05.135]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer.
[00:07:05.615 --> 00:07:08.297]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[00:07:09.057 --> 00:07:10.178]  For a while, anyway.
[00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:13.861]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:16.823]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:07:17.123 --> 00:07:20.626]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:07:20.986 --> 00:07:23.248]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:07:23.788 --> 00:07:24.509]  What's the name again?
[00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:25.890]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.110]  It's CalX.
[00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:27.631]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:31.622]  What makes Cal-X ointment so different?
[00:07:31.822 --> 00:07:40.165]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:45.748]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:07:45.968 --> 00:07:55.071]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:07:55.772 --> 00:07:56.872]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[00:07:56.932 --> 00:07:57.592]  I'll be right back.
[00:07:57.853 --> 00:07:58.793]  I'm getting some Cal-X.
[00:08:02.523 --> 00:08:08.546]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.146 --> 00:08:12.188]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.609 --> 00:08:16.950]  I forgot to ask John Harmon running the show.
[00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:25.995]  John, that video of the illegals celebrating, they put a sign up about Larry Conquista while the police beat the guy half to death.
[00:08:28.235 --> 00:08:32.298]  When you watch that audio and listen to it, do you think that will be any good for radio?
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.122]  Okay, did you download it?
[00:08:36.462 --> 00:08:37.262]  I ended it last night.
[00:08:40.045 --> 00:08:41.426]  Okay, well you can't miss it.
[00:08:41.486 --> 00:08:42.887]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:43.307 --> 00:08:44.048]  It's the top story.
[00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:47.931]  I was busy during the three-minute breakout doing business, so I did the business on air.
[00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:54.397]  But you really get the behind-the-scenes here, ladies and gentlemen, as we are completely transparent.
[00:08:56.992 --> 00:09:00.914]  If you want to watch the video, you can go up to PrisonPlanet.com and see it.
[00:09:01.394 --> 00:09:15.160]  Illegal immigrants are above the law, while American citizens, be they white, black, or Hispanic, are shoved around, watched, and brutalized by a police state that affords protection only to criminals.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:22.123]  This is by Paul Joseph Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[00:09:24.702 --> 00:09:28.946]  While American citizens are being brutalized, the illegals are by the law.
[00:09:29.046 --> 00:09:32.048]  And that is not a figure of speech.
[00:09:32.609 --> 00:09:34.690]  That is not an overgeneralization.
[00:09:35.631 --> 00:09:39.194]  That is the exact thing that is going on.
[00:09:40.427 --> 00:09:54.779]  Many were shocked and stunned by footage showing pro-illegal alien demonstrators cheer and taunt as police grab a man who stuck his middle finger up at the marchers before slamming his face into the concrete.
[00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:57.641]  But why should we be?
[00:09:57.801 --> 00:10:03.546]  Illegal aliens are a protected underclass and they are seemingly above the law.
[00:10:04.586 --> 00:10:08.870]  Now, before I go any further, I want to go back to what happened in Los Angeles about a week and a half ago.
[00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:20.275]  On May Day, 11 days ago to be precise, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens took to the street and I have done a lengthy investigation.
[00:10:20.555 --> 00:10:23.696]  Day one I said it looked like the police were in the wrong.
[00:10:23.996 --> 00:10:34.041]  We are on record saying even we're for the illegal aliens not being shot up close with rubber bullets and beaten with batons when they're running when there's no reason for it.
[00:10:35.539 --> 00:10:46.286]  But, we did go look at the footage of one group of young skipping school illegals throwing rocks and throwing bottles at police.
[00:10:47.186 --> 00:10:53.771]  And folks, if any other group of blacks or whites or hispanic citizens did that, the police would shoot you with automatic weapons.
[00:10:54.151 --> 00:10:56.592]  You would be run over by actual armored vehicles.
[00:10:56.972 --> 00:11:00.795]  They'd probably have helicopters strafing and call in napalm strikes.
[00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:01.892]  Okay?
[00:11:02.152 --> 00:11:08.420]  I mean, the LAPD will shoot you in the spinal cord, laugh at you, and then drop a bag of crack on you.
[00:11:08.841 --> 00:11:09.802]  I mean, it's on record.
[00:11:10.263 --> 00:11:12.386]  The CIA infiltrated in the mid-60s.
[00:11:12.706 --> 00:11:16.211]  It's been a government testing laboratory ever since.
[00:11:16.792 --> 00:11:18.875]  It is unspeakably corrupt and evil.
[00:11:19.716 --> 00:11:23.021]  Everyone knows if you talk back to LA cops, they'll beat you down.
[00:11:23.321 --> 00:11:25.064]  I don't care if you're in a Mercedes, folks.
[00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.588]  I mean, I've been out to LA many times.
[00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:34.279]  I know a lot of folks in Los Angeles, and you know you don't talk back to the cops in Los Angeles.
[00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:38.622]  Okay, they're not like New York cops acting like gangsters waddling around.
[00:11:38.642 --> 00:11:45.708]  No, they're very quiet, they're very focused, and they're like a pack of wolves, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:46.328 --> 00:11:53.934]  And they know they have the full support of the police department to literally rule as if God over Los Angeles.
[00:11:55.635 --> 00:11:57.417]  It is an occupied territory.
[00:11:58.518 --> 00:12:00.219]  They stood down, of course, during the L.A.
[00:12:00.259 --> 00:12:00.559]  riots.
[00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:02.741]  They were ordered to, to let that carnage take place.
[00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:06.142]  They're just unspeakable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:07.243 --> 00:12:11.568]  And if you run from the police like Rodney King, and people said it was because he was black.
[00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.629]  No!
[00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:17.414]  You run from the LAPD, you're going to get an hour-long beating.
[00:12:17.514 --> 00:12:22.059]  I mean, you might get a Diallo treatment like they do in New York.
[00:12:23.397 --> 00:12:26.300]  I mean, it's just, it's just, we've analyzed the L.A.
[00:12:27.141 --> 00:12:28.783]  Police Department and the Sheriff's Department.
[00:12:29.103 --> 00:12:31.847]  They were the first to be conditioned by the Feds.
[00:12:32.207 --> 00:12:33.589]  They were the first to be federalized.
[00:12:33.609 --> 00:12:37.133]  They were the first major city to have the CIA start running it.
[00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:40.877]  They are heavily in control of the narcotics trade.
[00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:42.860]  And, okay, I've said enough about L.A.
[00:12:44.915 --> 00:12:46.317]  I mean, it doesn't matter, folks.
[00:12:46.337 --> 00:12:54.068]  You get the illegal aliens out there throwing rocks and bottles at cops, they're not going to put up with it like they do in Seattle and other places where this has happened.
[00:12:56.371 --> 00:13:01.058]  The only other police department we've seen in history that is similar is the Dallas Police Department.
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:01.960]  You know, I say L.A.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.541]  is the first to be CIA run.
[00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:07.303]  We saw what happened in 1963 in Dallas, so I might have to correct myself.
[00:13:07.343 --> 00:13:10.104]  But it's been more... Dallas has been more mob run.
[00:13:10.324 --> 00:13:12.025]  People think of Chicago being mob run.
[00:13:12.585 --> 00:13:15.807]  Dallas is mob run, but it's very... it's kept on a low down.
[00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:20.048]  And it's more of a WASP mob, but they did merge the Italian and Jewish Mafia.
[00:13:20.649 --> 00:13:23.610]  And you just watch yourself in Dallas, too.
[00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.071]  I should add that.
[00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:27.772]  But... and I grew up there, let me tell you.
[00:13:28.633 --> 00:13:34.020]  The police run the drugs, they run the prostitution, they run the rackets, and you don't talk back.
[00:13:35.342 --> 00:13:36.844]  That's how it works, and the police will tell you.
[00:13:37.125 --> 00:13:38.366]  No one riots in Dallas.
[00:13:38.867 --> 00:13:44.595]  That's why you don't see those riots in Dallas, because the police have been on record saying, we shoot rioters.
[00:13:46.934 --> 00:13:51.138]  So to make a long story short, you get the illegal aliens out throwing their fit in the streets of L.A.
[00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:53.620]  and the police went wild.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.842]  That's welcome to how citizens are treated.
[00:13:56.322 --> 00:14:03.429]  And you get images of them running down newspaper reporters, running over press, running over families, pepper spraying families.
[00:14:04.128 --> 00:14:05.409]  And frankly, they were restrained.
[00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:07.271]  I mean, normally, they wouldn't even hold back.
[00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:13.856]  They'd run at full force, hit you full force, break your jaw, shoot you in the face at point-blank range, kill people with rubber bullets.
[00:14:13.876 --> 00:14:15.057]  It's happening every few months.
[00:14:15.077 --> 00:14:16.078]  People die of rubber bullets.
[00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.180]  You know, normally, it's point-blank range.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.641]  Here, they are restrained.
[00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:21.943]  They would first warn and then run you over.
[00:14:23.084 --> 00:14:29.169]  Now, you notice that the Larry Conquista mayor, who's openly sworn the death of America in public speeches.
[00:14:29.229 --> 00:14:29.950]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.151]  Just go pull it up.
[00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:34.886]  Uh, you know, this Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[00:14:34.906 --> 00:14:41.111]  Uh, he's having a walk of fine line here, so they're kind of suspending some officers while everybody forgets about it.
[00:14:42.052 --> 00:14:46.876]  And, you know, he's introducing kind of the Mexico style of, you know, just shut up, go to sleep.
[00:14:47.156 --> 00:14:47.937]  Of course, in Mexico!
[00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:51.390]  Uh, they had, uh, people protesting the stolen election.
[00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:53.890]  The cops just pulled up with machine guns, remember?
[00:14:53.911 --> 00:14:56.411]  Shot whole crowds, including American reporters.
[00:14:56.431 --> 00:15:00.452]  There's images of people on the ground, literally with the blood pouring out of their bodies.
[00:15:00.732 --> 00:15:02.013]  Their lifeblood as they die.
[00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:07.134]  So, you know, it's, it's, it's, we're all being inter- I mean, hell, the Lurica cases should be used to this.
[00:15:07.834 --> 00:15:10.875]  I mean, in Mexico, they machine gun you like they do in other areas of the U.S.
[00:15:11.556 --> 00:15:14.236]  So, there's a lot of whining, a lot of griping, a lot of complaining.
[00:15:14.756 --> 00:15:16.637]  And I fully understand what happened is wrong.
[00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:24.248]  Those that were throwing bottles and rocks should have been arrested, but no, no, no, no.
[00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:27.991]  The police are running around saying, double time it, it's time for a rumble.
[00:15:28.351 --> 00:15:30.612]  They like to have a police riot and go wild.
[00:15:31.153 --> 00:15:36.436]  There's nothing like routing families and running over them and stomping on children and stomping on reporters.
[00:15:38.558 --> 00:15:40.219]  So, that's what happened there.
[00:15:40.719 --> 00:15:44.962]  So, we're hearing a lot of whining and complaining, but you got light treatment.
[00:15:44.982 --> 00:15:46.823]  You got the light treatment.
[00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:50.431]  If you'd have been black, you'd have been dead, and we all know that.
[00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:52.492]  If you'd have been white, you'd have been dead.
[00:15:52.932 --> 00:15:59.575]  They got footage of 75-year-old white women being stomped outside their front doors because police have riots in neighborhoods.
[00:15:59.956 --> 00:16:00.836]  That's in the Takeover.
[00:16:01.256 --> 00:16:06.999]  We have young women on the ground where police stomp on them, and you hear pleasure sounds from the cops.
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:10.621]  I mean, breaking bones, folks.
[00:16:10.761 --> 00:16:13.663]  When a full-grown man starts stomping on you, that's how you kill people.
[00:16:15.792 --> 00:16:17.293]  And, you know, just stomping some women.
[00:16:18.254 --> 00:16:19.935]  So, uh, you're lucky.
[00:16:20.555 --> 00:16:21.016]  Alrighty?
[00:16:21.636 --> 00:16:22.577]  Everybody knows that.
[00:16:22.937 --> 00:16:33.724]  If it wasn't that you were so special, and that you were so important to destroying America, if you weren't the actual knife being drawn across the throat, uh, you would have been machine-gunned in the streets, probably.
[00:16:34.085 --> 00:16:34.505]  Alright?
[00:16:34.525 --> 00:16:36.246]  Okay, good.
[00:16:36.306 --> 00:16:37.047]  Now you understand.
[00:16:37.067 --> 00:16:38.748]  Uh, you're very special.
[00:16:39.108 --> 00:16:44.652]  Illegal immigrants are above the law, while American citizens, be they white, black, or Hispanic, are shoved around
[00:16:45.465 --> 00:16:49.148]  Watched and brutalized by a police state that affords protection only to criminals.
[00:16:50.629 --> 00:17:04.741]  Many were shocked and stunned by the footage showing pro-illegal alien demonstrators cheering and taunt as police grab a man who stuck his middle finger up as the marchers before slamming his face into the concrete.
[00:17:05.082 --> 00:17:06.203]  But why should we care?
[00:17:06.923 --> 00:17:07.223]  You know?
[00:17:07.644 --> 00:17:08.565]  Why should we be?
[00:17:08.585 --> 00:17:12.428]  Illegal aliens are protected
[00:17:13.348 --> 00:17:15.850]  Underclass, and they are seemingly above the law.
[00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:16.750]  Well, there's no seemingly.
[00:17:17.250 --> 00:17:27.196]  The video shows pro-illegals, no doubt illegals, screaming and cheering with glee as cops manhandle someone who dare voice an opposing opinion.
[00:17:28.457 --> 00:17:36.382]  While other passengers, while other passerbys vandalize the man's car and verbally taunt him.
[00:17:36.462 --> 00:17:40.124]  And this just goes on and on, the humiliation.
[00:17:40.948 --> 00:17:47.177]  Now, folks, you get within 20 feet of cops arresting somebody, and they will run up to you and arrest you instantly.
[00:17:47.737 --> 00:17:49.820]  Interfering with police procedures.
[00:17:50.281 --> 00:17:51.402]  Interfering with an arrest.
[00:17:51.963 --> 00:17:53.024]  Obstruction of justice.
[00:17:53.565 --> 00:17:54.927]  Interfering with an officer's duties.
[00:17:55.027 --> 00:17:56.089]  You know the writ.
[00:17:57.808 --> 00:18:01.373]  We've heard it by rote a million times and every cop listening knows it.
[00:18:01.954 --> 00:18:02.294]  Not here.
[00:18:02.314 --> 00:18:07.021]  Illegals are running up within two feet of the guy bleeding and the cops just aren't saying a word.
[00:18:07.101 --> 00:18:10.766]  It's just, there's all these cops and the illegals are allowed to celebrate and do whatever they want.
[00:18:11.327 --> 00:18:13.109]  Ha ha ha, they scream and cuss.
[00:18:13.390 --> 00:18:14.171]  Look at you now.
[00:18:15.626 --> 00:18:16.747]  Yeah, look at him now.
[00:18:16.827 --> 00:18:17.447]  Look at him now.
[00:18:17.507 --> 00:18:19.448]  Can't you see you work for the man?
[00:18:19.769 --> 00:18:20.549]  Don't you understand that?
[00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:21.850]  Your children have no future.
[00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:29.775]  If you join America, and if you'd fight for the Republic, and if you'd realize what was happening, you might have some future.
[00:18:29.815 --> 00:18:35.358]  But as it is, we're being thrown into the ring like two pit bulls against each other, and we're both going to lose.
[00:18:36.199 --> 00:18:37.159]  Don't you understand that?
[00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:37.779]  Don't you see that?
[00:18:40.217 --> 00:18:44.923]  In any other case, an individual interfering with an arrest would immediately be confronted and possibly arrested by police.
[00:18:45.384 --> 00:18:48.428]  But not in this instance, because illegal aliens are above the law.
[00:18:48.968 --> 00:18:51.912]  Aliens have already broken the law by entering the country without permission.
[00:18:52.252 --> 00:18:57.860]  They are already criminals, but instead of being treated as such, they are exalted to be god-like status.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:01.060]  Where they are outside of laws that govern the rest of us.
[00:19:01.641 --> 00:19:04.701]  Illegal aliens are not required to have insurance or driver's license.
[00:19:05.001 --> 00:19:11.202]  When police pull them over, and we have lynched articles admitting that, and they can't speak English, the cops just let them go.
[00:19:11.222 --> 00:19:18.504]  This is commonly accepted, and we have talked directly to police who have admitted to the fact that they are ordered to release illegal aliens.
[00:19:18.884 --> 00:19:20.824]  We have newscasts and articles where the illegals say it.
[00:19:21.724 --> 00:19:26.745]  In one law, it's one law for American citizens, and another law for illegal aliens.
[00:19:28.175 --> 00:19:29.436]  The precious illegal aliens.
[00:19:29.836 --> 00:19:41.623]  Illegal aliens can now cash checks, get credit cards and open bank accounts without social security numbers or cards or any other documentation besides an easily obtained card from the government of a different country.
[00:19:42.103 --> 00:19:46.446]  Yet American citizens are shunned if they don't have all their papers in order.
[00:19:47.206 --> 00:19:49.047]  We'll come back and finish up this article.
[00:19:49.107 --> 00:19:49.908]  It goes on and on.
[00:19:50.845 --> 00:19:52.149]  And it's only going to get worse.
[00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:58.645]  They're importing groups to create balkanization, setting up a race war by design.
[00:19:58.985 --> 00:20:00.248]  You're being set up, illegals.
[00:20:02.822 --> 00:20:04.884]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.505 --> 00:20:14.435]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.876 --> 00:20:22.084]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.794 --> 00:20:28.280]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:39.591]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:40.352 --> 00:20:42.374]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:20:42.914 --> 00:20:45.698]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:45.758 --> 00:20:46.078]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:06.406]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[00:21:06.426 --> 00:21:07.688]  dollar has been devaluating.
[00:21:07.848 --> 00:21:11.433]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[00:21:11.713 --> 00:21:14.237]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[00:21:14.637 --> 00:21:16.400]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.043]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[00:21:20.064 --> 00:21:25.728]  If you had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[00:21:25.788 --> 00:21:28.190]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:29.811]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[00:21:37.836 --> 00:21:40.298]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:40.378 --> 00:21:43.321]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[00:21:43.341 --> 00:21:44.061]  Call 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:21:44.101 --> 00:21:46.803]  Take action today while we still accept paper dollars for gold.
[00:21:46.823 --> 00:21:47.464]  That's 1-800-686-2237 extension 169.
[00:22:02.592 --> 00:22:11.657]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:22:11.917 --> 00:22:23.144]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:22:23.484 --> 00:22:28.507]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[00:22:28.527 --> 00:22:28.667]  I think?
[00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:50.658]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:22:51.459 --> 00:22:52.381]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.401 --> 00:22:52.882]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.902 --> 00:22:54.505]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:23:02.017 --> 00:23:02.998]  How are you doing today?
[00:23:03.218 --> 00:23:03.678]  Why ask?
[00:23:03.718 --> 00:23:09.802]  Because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:14.445]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[00:23:14.745 --> 00:23:20.309]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come, and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[00:23:20.609 --> 00:23:25.612]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[00:23:25.853 --> 00:23:32.257]  The powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.

[00:23:35.879 --> 00:23:39.982]  We'll also offer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.
[00:23:40.182 --> 00:23:42.324]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[00:23:42.604 --> 00:23:50.209]  Find out why Mangosteen is known as the Queen of All Fruits and why it's fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[00:23:50.609 --> 00:23:52.050]  Your health is in your hands.
[00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:53.551]  Do something about it today.
[00:23:53.831 --> 00:23:54.051]  Call 800-658-0597.
[00:23:54.071 --> 00:23:54.451]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[00:24:08.729 --> 00:24:12.692]  They want to pass hate crimes laws where if you verbally intimidate somebody, you get arrested.
[00:24:12.712 --> 00:24:15.194]  But of course, that will all be selectively enforced.
[00:24:15.675 --> 00:24:22.320]  As the cops slam your face repeatedly into the concrete and blood pours from your face, the illegals can racially taunt you all they wish.
[00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:25.122]  Go watch the video.
[00:24:25.743 --> 00:24:32.688]  We really can't play it here because it's so much street noise and cussing and screaming that a lot of it isn't really discernible.
[00:24:32.708 --> 00:24:36.812]  You've got to see it with the video up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:24:38.431 --> 00:24:49.436]  Illegal aliens can now cash checks, get credit cards and open bank accounts without a social security number or any other documentation besides an easily obtained card from the government of a different country.
[00:24:49.816 --> 00:24:54.078]  Consular matriculas now over a hundred countries are accepted and literally you can just buy these anywhere.
[00:24:54.098 --> 00:24:55.119]  There's no verification.
[00:24:55.139 --> 00:24:55.739]  There's no nothing.
[00:24:58.155 --> 00:25:01.918]  Yet American citizens are shunned if they don't have all their papers in order.
[00:25:02.398 --> 00:25:08.283]  Organizations like Bank of America reward criminals for entering the country illegally and give them a clear incentive to stay.
[00:25:08.823 --> 00:25:15.028]  In that article of four or five months ago, AP, the headline was, Lenders Aid Try to Aid Immigrants.
[00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:16.149]  It was some headline like that.
[00:25:16.189 --> 00:25:17.250]  I don't remember the exact headline.
[00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.792]  It said, 800 plus lenders.
[00:25:19.872 --> 00:25:21.673]  And it had the quotes from different bank chairmen.
[00:25:21.693 --> 00:25:23.274]  I read it over and over again on air.
[00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:28.464]  Banks aid illegals or banks lend to immigrants.
[00:25:28.504 --> 00:25:29.465]  There's a bunch of articles.
[00:25:29.485 --> 00:25:33.068]  It was the LA Times, AP, Reuters, but AP was the big one.
[00:25:33.428 --> 00:25:40.654]  And it had bank chairman in there going, we know the people are trying to kick them out by giving them houses and loans without ID.
[00:25:40.714 --> 00:25:43.436]  It helps them stay because they're so important.
[00:25:44.837 --> 00:25:48.060]  No, you know that they're working and on welfare on average.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:50.682]  And you know it's all subsidized by the welfare.
[00:25:52.262 --> 00:25:55.404]  In many areas of the country, illegals take out triple of what they contribute.
[00:25:55.424 --> 00:25:56.725]  Those are official government numbers.
[00:25:56.745 --> 00:25:57.465]  You can go pull them up.
[00:25:58.526 --> 00:26:05.690]  But again, it's a subsidy of slave labor wages subsidized by welfare to the corporations who want to do what?
[00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:06.631]  Destroy the middle class.
[00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:11.811]  And I get dumb emails from people going, that's code for white people.
[00:26:11.851 --> 00:26:22.196]  Well, I'm sad for you if you don't see your race, the human race, but your derivation, your group, as ever being part of the middle class.
[00:26:22.356 --> 00:26:27.138]  I'm sorry you see yourself as working class or low class or whatever word you want to put on it.
[00:26:28.904 --> 00:26:30.766]  Everybody should be able to be upwardly mobile.
[00:26:30.806 --> 00:26:33.028]  But I know, let's just all be peons together.
[00:26:33.468 --> 00:26:34.870]  Let's all be in the ghetto together.
[00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.191]  That's just the way.
[00:26:36.472 --> 00:26:39.214]  Anybody who tries to get out of it is a sellout.
[00:26:39.314 --> 00:26:40.536]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:40.716 --> 00:26:42.538]  That's exactly what the globalists want.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:50.346]  It continues, this isn't an issue of race or affording leniency to minorities.
[00:26:51.636 --> 00:27:03.066]  It is a matter of deciding if the law should be applied to everyone who resides in the United States or whether certain segments of the population should be exempt from it and allowed to commit crime without punishment.
[00:27:03.999 --> 00:27:06.741]  And again, I will add, this is all being done to erase the middle class.
[00:27:07.221 --> 00:27:13.846]  But don't worry, because the Bush Administration has a solution for dealing with criminals that have already broken the law by entering the country illegally.
[00:27:14.187 --> 00:27:19.150]  Simply legalize them all with a mass amnesty program, and then of course tell the dumb public it isn't an amnesty.
[00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:23.674]  This is akin to a city mayor dealing with a rash of shootings by legalizing murder.
[00:27:24.174 --> 00:27:26.876]  Eradicate the crime by just taking it off the books.
[00:27:27.336 --> 00:27:35.303]  Meanwhile, border agents who attempt to apprehend drug smugglers attempting to sneak into the United States are jailed and subsequently beaten for violating the illegal alien's rights.
[00:27:35.663 --> 00:27:38.905]  This is the message the Bush administration sends to the Border Patrol.
[00:27:38.986 --> 00:27:41.988]  If you do your job, then you'll be punished for it.
[00:27:43.917 --> 00:27:44.618]  Absolutely.
[00:27:45.338 --> 00:27:58.449]  Why are illegal aliens, who have already broken the law and are criminals, are lavished and coddled by governments and large corporations, while American citizens, be they white, black, or Hispanic, are pushed around, surveilled, and lectured by Big Brother?
[00:27:59.773 --> 00:28:11.180]  The plan is to piggyback the agenda to merge the U.S., Mexico, and Canada into the North American Union onto an openly stated invasion, the Oslon Reconquista, and the radical annexation of the American Southwest.
[00:28:11.681 --> 00:28:17.324]  The plan is to destroy America, folks, to ruin our name, to blow out our currency, to blow out our sovereignty.
[00:28:17.384 --> 00:28:18.085]  It's all happening.
[00:28:18.345 --> 00:28:21.667]  This is... This is the plan to destroy us.
[00:28:21.727 --> 00:28:22.408]  You understand?
[00:28:22.648 --> 00:28:27.351]  This is war, and you're just being used, illegal aliens, like the Nazis used you in 1917 and 1940.
[00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:30.670]  Plan of San Diego.
[00:28:32.551 --> 00:28:33.071]  It goes on.
[00:28:33.531 --> 00:28:36.673]  Oslon Radicals subscribe to bizarre liberation theology.
[00:28:36.953 --> 00:28:42.055]  By the way, we pointed out that we're wearing Plan of San Diego shirts at the Texas Illegal Alien Rallies.
[00:28:42.735 --> 00:28:52.278]  We had the Texas Civil Rights Review come out and say, yes, it is a plan to kill all whites, but you know, whites have been evil and this is needed.
[00:28:52.959 --> 00:28:54.379]  I mean, they just said it!
[00:28:54.639 --> 00:28:56.620]  I'm going, please don't say you're going to kill me!
[00:28:59.216 --> 00:29:01.036]  We should all just live together.
[00:29:03.117 --> 00:29:04.917]  Everybody knows that isn't how it works, folks.
[00:29:06.778 --> 00:29:10.878]  And then I'm bad for going, my God, you're having mass meetings about how you want to kill me?
[00:29:11.438 --> 00:29:12.239]  And my family?
[00:29:12.979 --> 00:29:14.399]  Well, I'm going to be forced to fight you!
[00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.879]  I mean, it's real simple.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:19.980]  Somebody declares war on me, I declare war on them.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.981]  You attack me, I'm going to attack you right back.
[00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:31.113]  And if you want to be used by the New World Order, I just want to give you the newsflash.
[00:29:32.014 --> 00:29:34.496]  You are going to be sacrificed first, okay?
[00:29:34.736 --> 00:29:35.736]  You're being set up.
[00:29:36.037 --> 00:29:44.683]  And when you get sacrificed by the New World Order, when you get obliterated and crushed, the dumb what's left of white America is going to join the New World Order en masse.
[00:29:44.723 --> 00:29:45.803]  That's going to be the wedding.
[00:29:46.824 --> 00:29:47.385]  You understand?
[00:29:47.405 --> 00:29:48.365]  You're being set up.
[00:29:48.765 --> 00:29:50.267]  This is very sophisticated.
[00:29:51.988 --> 00:29:52.968]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.369 --> 00:29:54.890]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.871 --> 00:29:58.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.453 --> 00:30:03.613]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[00:30:03.633 --> 00:30:05.774]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:30:06.134 --> 00:30:09.135]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:30:09.195 --> 00:30:09.875]  is a real thing.
[00:30:09.955 --> 00:30:16.797]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:30:16.957 --> 00:30:22.218]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:30:22.398 --> 00:30:23.159]  We're good to go!
[00:30:49.221 --> 00:30:53.928]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:30:54.208 --> 00:30:57.072]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:30:57.253 --> 00:31:00.918]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:06.173]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:09.514]  Soon, it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:31:09.835 --> 00:31:12.396]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:31:12.756 --> 00:31:17.579]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:31:17.959 --> 00:31:23.322]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:31:23.642 --> 00:31:26.604]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:27.344]  We're good to go.
[00:31:50.191 --> 00:31:55.642]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:31:55.662 --> 00:31:56.103]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:32:01.656 --> 00:32:05.720]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:09.323]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:09.503 --> 00:32:13.026]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:13.246 --> 00:32:16.509]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:16.529 --> 00:32:21.994]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[00:32:22.014 --> 00:32:27.259]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:32:27.639 --> 00:32:28.259]  We're good to go!
[00:32:45.109 --> 00:32:51.073]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com That toll free number again?
[00:32:51.093 --> 00:32:52.334]  1-877-928-8822 Strange days have come
[00:33:19.504 --> 00:33:22.705]  I got a couple audio clips I want to play, then we'll take some calls.
[00:33:22.725 --> 00:33:22.965]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:22.985 --> 00:33:23.105]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:23.125 --> 00:33:24.925]  Let me just put the word out, because I tell it all like it is.
[00:33:24.945 --> 00:33:26.746]  I'll let you know exactly what's in my heart and my mind.
[00:33:26.766 --> 00:33:30.706]  Whether you're black, white, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, northerner, southerner,
[00:33:49.073 --> 00:33:50.114]  Westerner, I don't care.
[00:33:51.234 --> 00:33:52.615]  I want you to live in freedom.
[00:33:52.675 --> 00:33:53.816]  I want you to do well.
[00:33:54.457 --> 00:33:55.857]  I want your family to do well.
[00:33:55.937 --> 00:33:57.258]  I want your children to do well.
[00:33:58.059 --> 00:34:01.601]  I'm here trying to keep you from giving your children mercury-filled shots.
[00:34:02.402 --> 00:34:04.743]  I'm here trying to warn you about the New World Order.
[00:34:05.744 --> 00:34:06.364]  I'm your friend.
[00:34:06.384 --> 00:34:09.066]  Because I know we have Larry Conquistas and people listening.
[00:34:10.407 --> 00:34:12.908]  And I want you to understand that you're being played.
[00:34:12.968 --> 00:34:13.909]  We're all being played.
[00:34:13.929 --> 00:34:16.270]  These phony Republicans that support Bush are being played.
[00:34:16.691 --> 00:34:18.512]  Liberals that support Hillary are being played.
[00:34:20.289 --> 00:34:22.491]  And we have to stop being tribal.
[00:34:22.631 --> 00:34:27.474]  We have to stop, that is, letting ourselves be tribally manipulated.
[00:34:27.494 --> 00:34:31.796]  We have to truly start being tribal as free human beings against the elite.
[00:34:32.477 --> 00:34:37.380]  And the elite, ladies and gentlemen, isn't the middle class side of town that you call the white side of town.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:44.004]  And you think somebody living in a $50,000 car, $200,000 house is the elite.
[00:34:45.064 --> 00:34:49.527]  And anybody that lives in that part of the neighborhood that's got your skin color must be a traitor.
[00:34:51.357 --> 00:34:58.560]  We've got to recognize the true elites, and we've got to realize that they are against all of us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:59.101 --> 00:35:04.863]  They put aspartame in 9,000-plus food products, and all of our children drink and eat it.
[00:35:05.784 --> 00:35:07.925]  They put brainwashing into the television.
[00:35:08.385 --> 00:35:11.026]  You know, they engineer the society to dumb everybody down.
[00:35:12.268 --> 00:35:21.734]  I tell the cops this, that they give you the deadly shots, they give your children the same deadly shots, they give you the same crap food, knowing what it's doing to you, the same GMO food.
[00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:24.356]  Look, we're all in this together.
[00:35:25.817 --> 00:35:27.378]  We're all, and that's what frustrates me.
[00:35:28.279 --> 00:35:31.421]  They got us all divided into black, white, Hispanic, cop,
[00:35:32.475 --> 00:35:36.998]  Non-cop, government, non-government, Catholic, Protestant, Jew, Muslim.
[00:35:37.479 --> 00:35:44.624]  They got us all divided about, oh, they live in North Austin, we live in South Austin, oh, they live in the Bronx, we live in Jersey City.
[00:35:48.106 --> 00:35:48.826]  It doesn't matter.
[00:35:48.846 --> 00:35:51.428]  We're all human beings, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:52.809 --> 00:35:55.031]  Well, you know, I'm a southerner, he's a Yankee.
[00:35:56.712 --> 00:35:58.033]  Well, he's a, he's a hick.
[00:36:01.184 --> 00:36:05.667]  You know, the Californians, all the yuppies think they're the elite and everybody else is dumb.
[00:36:05.687 --> 00:36:11.730]  Let me tell you, people who all think they're the smartest and got all the answers and think somebody else is dumb, you're a fool.
[00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:13.451]  Never judge a book by its cover.
[00:36:17.213 --> 00:36:24.097]  Let me tell you, some dumb yuppie making $200,000 a year who thinks they know everything, doesn't have half the wisdom of some poor
[00:36:27.685 --> 00:36:49.640]  Peasant farmer that just got over the border from Mexico because if you can If the few that can speak English you actually talk to them, they know all about currencies They actually know all about the New World Order and they'll say yeah, I know the young people in your country this yeah, you know the young children of Or the older children of illegal aliens, they're spoiled and they're you know, we know they're brainwashed.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:52.082]  Yeah, we understand how where everybody's being played and
[00:36:56.317 --> 00:36:59.838]  That's mainly, by the way, who's out rioting and attacking people.
[00:37:00.658 --> 00:37:01.638]  There were lots of attacks.
[00:37:01.658 --> 00:37:04.739]  Remember last year when they had the demonstrations all over the country?
[00:37:06.039 --> 00:37:07.680]  Millions all over the country of illegal aliens.
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.880]  There were reports all over.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:09.800]  It'd be in local papers.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:13.041]  Well, some cars got beat up and some cars got burned.
[00:37:13.081 --> 00:37:17.242]  Some people in a car got pulled out and assaulted, but the police did nothing.
[00:37:18.142 --> 00:37:21.303]  Boy, can you imagine if Hispanics would have been jerked out of a car and beaten?
[00:37:21.703 --> 00:37:24.544]  The national news, the Hollywood movies that would have been made about it.
[00:37:25.603 --> 00:37:37.952]  The only reason the establishment has ordered the cops to stand down while whites and blacks, all over LA by the way, blacks are being targeted and killed by the illegal aliens, and they've announced it's a plan to kill them, that's in the plan of San Diego.
[00:37:38.753 --> 00:37:47.039]  It's all kept real quiet though, because again, this is a special group, not because they have some wonderful plans for you, but because you're being used.
[00:37:49.207 --> 00:37:50.349]  It's like a murder weapon.
[00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.976]  Again, a double-edged dagger being used to jam into America's heart.
[00:37:54.377 --> 00:37:56.822]  And when they're done with the murder weapon, folks, they're going to throw you in the lake.
[00:37:59.395 --> 00:38:06.280]  Just like Hitler used the errants of Rome and the brown shirts to come to power, then they had the nine of the long knives and killed tens of thousands of them in a single night.
[00:38:06.801 --> 00:38:07.841]  You're being set up.
[00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:13.646]  When they tell people they're building all these camps, they say it's for you, and they're testing them out with families that are illegal aliens.
[00:38:13.966 --> 00:38:15.988]  And I've been out there, we've been out there protesting it.
[00:38:16.288 --> 00:38:17.969]  This office has been out there protesting it.
[00:38:18.389 --> 00:38:19.710]  We've done video reports on it.
[00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:23.073]  We've said it's wrong to put illegal alien families in camps.
[00:38:24.274 --> 00:38:25.995]  To separate the families from their children.
[00:38:26.576 --> 00:38:27.016]  It's wrong.
[00:38:28.118 --> 00:38:28.378]  See?
[00:38:29.019 --> 00:38:31.621]  And I said for years, it's going to be tested on you.
[00:38:31.881 --> 00:38:32.622]  And what happened?
[00:38:32.962 --> 00:38:37.466]  It was tested on you, and they said in the news, oh, it's for illegal aliens and, of course, citizens.
[00:38:38.647 --> 00:38:40.488]  That was in the Houston Chronicle last January.
[00:38:40.889 --> 00:38:41.749]  How did I know that?
[00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:51.257]  Rex 84, declassified, leaked in 86, says that they would claim they were going to build camps for illegals and illegal alien race riots.
[00:38:51.958 --> 00:38:53.279]  Which they're going to foster, by the way.
[00:38:54.332 --> 00:38:58.514]  And that then it would really be used as a smokescreen to arrest their political opposition.
[00:38:59.234 --> 00:39:07.957]  You see how your leaders, why do you think Ford, and GM, and Miller Brewing, and AT&T, I mean, no one's better financed than Mecha and La Raza.
[00:39:09.198 --> 00:39:09.818]  And Lulek.
[00:39:11.038 --> 00:39:13.679]  Why are you, why is your way paved in gold?
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:20.442]  I mean, you think the cold-blooded corporate chiefs are doing this because they like you and they share your vision of Aslan?
[00:39:20.862 --> 00:39:21.242]  No!
[00:39:21.522 --> 00:39:23.043]  Because you're being set up
[00:39:23.897 --> 00:39:25.238]  Now maybe you like being shut up.
[00:39:25.258 --> 00:39:26.058]  Maybe you don't care.
[00:39:26.278 --> 00:39:31.282]  Maybe just getting crazed out in the streets and waving the Mexican flag and feeling good is all that matters now.
[00:39:32.282 --> 00:39:33.743]  Maybe your children don't matter.
[00:39:35.104 --> 00:39:40.747]  But the Patrons up in Washington are playing you and everybody else like a fiddle.
[00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:44.850]  Like a well-rosined fiddle.
[00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:47.491]  And I can see what they're doing.
[00:39:47.972 --> 00:39:49.212]  And I've got their documents.
[00:39:49.493 --> 00:39:51.774]  And I'm here warning you and telling you.
[00:39:52.893 --> 00:39:59.177]  Your Mexican leaders aren't telling you to go tear out those Planned Parenthoods to picket them and shut them down.
[00:39:59.537 --> 00:40:03.960]  Death mills that call you weeds and scum that are there to kill your Raza.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.302]  I do tell you to stop it and save your Raza.
[00:40:08.462 --> 00:40:10.363]  Your leaders don't care about your Raza.
[00:40:11.204 --> 00:40:14.626]  Your leaders are bought and paid for and there to keep you peeing on.
[00:40:15.606 --> 00:40:16.387]  Same thing with the black
[00:40:17.128 --> 00:40:22.249]  Leaders, they're there to pimp you out and say what you want to hear, but make sure you stay in your place.
[00:40:22.769 --> 00:40:27.551]  Make sure you take your mercury shots and make sure the CPS can grab your kids for medical experiments.
[00:40:27.931 --> 00:40:33.872]  Your leaders are scum, trash, and you know in your gut, right now, that I'm telling you the truth.
[00:40:35.512 --> 00:40:41.694]  So, break your conditioning and fight the New World Order, or you can, I guess, perish and serve your masters.
[00:40:45.729 --> 00:40:50.399]  Many of you won't listen, but later, if the enemy wins, you will wish, you will remember what I said.
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:55.890]  You'll say, oh, I remember that Alex Jones, he said that 15 years ago, and look, it happened.
[00:40:56.331 --> 00:40:57.073]  When you're in a camp.
[00:40:58.843 --> 00:40:59.544]  Absolutely.
[00:40:59.844 --> 00:41:02.425]  Because I told it to you straight.
[00:41:03.086 --> 00:41:04.086]  I did the studying.
[00:41:04.607 --> 00:41:05.607]  I did the research.
[00:41:06.128 --> 00:41:07.649]  I understood the enemy's program.
[00:41:07.909 --> 00:41:13.712]  And I'm here putting myself out up front, ladies and gentlemen, on the front lines to warn you.
[00:41:13.892 --> 00:41:17.214]  But I'm not going to candy it up and I'm not going to dress it up.
[00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:20.837]  Stop declaring war on my people!
[00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.473]  Stop shooting your mouth off about America!
[00:41:24.974 --> 00:41:28.397]  America hasn't been perfect, but it's been the best thing there's been!
[00:41:29.118 --> 00:41:32.161]  Why do you think the New World Order is trying to tear it down?
[00:41:32.762 --> 00:41:35.966]  Because at an intellectual level, I can coldly understand what's happening.
[00:41:36.106 --> 00:41:43.454]  But at my primitive level, a bunch of people beating war drums and screaming for my family's blood gets me very angry.
[00:41:44.094 --> 00:41:45.175]  And gets my blood up!
[00:41:45.555 --> 00:41:47.116]  And makes me stop thinking clearly!
[00:41:47.456 --> 00:41:52.319]  And let me tell ya, if I stop thinking clearly, a lot of other people are gonna stop thinking clearly!
[00:41:52.339 --> 00:42:05.586]  Let me finish up the article Paul Watson wrote, that I'm serious, I want you to go get this article, and I want you to four-wind it.
[00:42:06.506 --> 00:42:09.808]  Just like the article we put together about only Ron Paul can defeat Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.629]  Well, this article is key.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.382]  Legal aliens are above the law.
[00:42:15.884 --> 00:42:26.917]  And it ends with... The plan is to piggyback the agenda to merge the U.S., Mexico, and Canada into a North American Union onto an openly stated invasion.
[00:42:27.738 --> 00:42:31.703]  The Aslan Reconquista and the radical annexation of American Southwest.
[00:42:32.444 --> 00:42:47.088]  Oslon radicals subscribe to a bizarre liberation theology that the Southwest and the Western states are their ancestral homeland and that they are justified in launching a violent and bloody separatist war, including the ethnic cleansing of blacks and whites to reconquer the territory.
[00:42:49.208 --> 00:42:55.970]  Their motives overlap with the global elite, the liberation theology was created by the elite in the fifties, and steer the control them.
[00:42:57.489 --> 00:42:58.370]  The destruction of U.S.
[00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:04.653]  sovereignty and the excuse for total lockdown police state once rioting and race war ensues.
[00:43:05.293 --> 00:43:14.437]  This is why rampant illegal immigration and the protection of illegal criminals who have entered the United States is a deliberate policy of a criminal corporation that has hijacked the U.S.
[00:43:14.457 --> 00:43:14.818]  government.
[00:43:15.158 --> 00:43:17.139]  This is why the illegals are above the law.
[00:43:18.199 --> 00:43:21.361]  The article is, illegal immigrants are above the law.
[00:43:23.918 --> 00:43:29.621]  I told you that Bill Clinton gave a speech in 1994 calling for Homeland Security.
[00:43:30.222 --> 00:43:31.682]  Homeland Security was set up in 1997.
[00:43:31.963 --> 00:43:34.424]  You can just Google this, pull up the documents.
[00:43:34.924 --> 00:43:37.046]  Here is a news piece, a newscast piece.
[00:43:37.984 --> 00:43:44.286]  Where they are talking about how they were setting up Homeland Security and the Pentagon when it was attacked.
[00:43:44.766 --> 00:43:45.126]  Okay?
[00:43:45.546 --> 00:43:49.947]  Because I know most people won't go read the actual documents, but here's a newscast at Bennington.
[00:43:50.007 --> 00:43:50.227]  Okay?
[00:43:50.387 --> 00:43:51.488]  This stuff is all staged.
[00:43:51.508 --> 00:43:52.428]  Here it is.
[00:43:52.468 --> 00:43:53.748]  In fact, there may not be a death toll.
[00:43:53.788 --> 00:44:02.811]  The casualty toll there may be much lower than originally feared for the simple reason that the part of the Pentagon that was struck today by an airliner
[00:44:03.391 --> 00:44:08.152]  Was in fact undergoing renovation and as a consequence not all the offices there were occupied.
[00:44:08.192 --> 00:44:22.916]  James Rosen earlier had passed on a report, interestingly enough, that a couple of the offices in that portion of the Pentagon, portions that were struck, were offices that deal with trying to deal with counter-terrorism.
[00:44:22.996 --> 00:44:25.057]  One is called the Office of Homeland Defense.
[00:44:25.517 --> 00:44:30.378]  It's a newly created office that was slated to get a big budget increase even though Secretary
[00:44:31.403 --> 00:44:33.344]  Where do you think they're going to plant the bomb?
[00:44:34.864 --> 00:44:41.547]  To go with the missile or plant the radio homing beacons, which we've had experts look at it.
[00:44:41.707 --> 00:44:47.949]  It was newly installed with cinder blocks, little receivers and transmitters on top of it.
[00:44:48.449 --> 00:44:50.070]  Of course they struck themselves.
[00:44:52.105 --> 00:44:53.545]  I guess that's the rationale.
[00:44:53.585 --> 00:44:58.387]  Well, we'll just hit the area with the least amount of the Pentagon people in it.
[00:44:58.647 --> 00:45:04.308]  Again, Generals will put thousands of troops in a valley or in an area to lure in the enemy.
[00:45:04.508 --> 00:45:06.388]  They make those decisions every day in a war.
[00:45:07.189 --> 00:45:08.469]  That's how they made the decision.
[00:45:08.509 --> 00:45:09.029]  Yeah, kill 3,000.
[00:45:09.269 --> 00:45:10.910]  Yeah, attack the Pentagon.
[00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:11.990]  Yeah, go ahead and do it.
[00:45:12.930 --> 00:45:16.651]  And see, you can't get that through your head, General Public, and that's why we may lose.
[00:45:17.521 --> 00:45:24.949]  Because you just can't get your mind into their headset, into their mindset, into their views, looking through their eyes, walking in their shoes.
[00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:29.734]  These are people who kidnap over a million women and children a year, okay?
[00:45:31.055 --> 00:45:34.599]  And again, stuff that you see in movies like Hostile, folks, that's the tip of the iceberg.
[00:45:34.639 --> 00:45:35.860]  That stuff's real, okay?
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.161]  That's who we're dealing with.
[00:45:37.201 --> 00:45:37.602]  Here it is.
[00:45:38.283 --> 00:45:39.564]  For those that missed it,
[00:46:07.509 --> 00:46:08.229]  Play it again.
[00:46:08.269 --> 00:46:13.112]  Now again, Homeland Security set up, announced in the early 90s, set up in the late 90s.
[00:46:14.232 --> 00:46:15.092]  It was already built.
[00:46:15.433 --> 00:46:22.075]  They used Y2K that they hyped, that the Navy, that the Naval War College report, remember?
[00:46:22.556 --> 00:46:24.176]  Started the whole hype a year before.
[00:46:24.737 --> 00:46:31.380]  They used that to put in FEMA command bunkers, what they call threat integration centers, where the locals are going to be under CIA control.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:33.140]  We told you years before that would be the plan.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.761]  Now they've announced it.
[00:46:34.901 --> 00:46:36.842]  FEMA, the county, the city, the feds, the state.
[00:46:37.526 --> 00:46:42.732]  Again, the first one they built was in Building 7, right below the CIA offices.
[00:46:42.812 --> 00:46:43.773]  You see how they do this?
[00:46:44.474 --> 00:46:46.096]  Play it again for everybody.
[00:46:46.156 --> 00:46:50.400]  This is the shadow government coming out into plain view, attacking itself.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:50.821]  Here it is.
[00:46:51.522 --> 00:46:53.023]  Well, in fact, there may not be a death toll.
[00:46:53.043 --> 00:47:04.289]  The casualty toll there may be much lower than originally feared for the simple reason that the part of the Pentagon that was struck today by an airliner was, in fact, undergoing renovation.
[00:47:04.369 --> 00:47:07.430]  And as a consequence, not all the offices there were occupied.
[00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:11.012]  James Rosen earlier had passed on a report, interestingly enough,
[00:47:12.034 --> 00:47:22.178]  That a couple of the offices in that portion of the Pentagon, the portions that were struck, were offices that deal with counter-terrorism.
[00:47:22.258 --> 00:47:24.319]  One is called the Office of Homeland Defense.
[00:47:24.779 --> 00:47:33.082]  It's a newly created office that was slated to get a big budget increase, even though Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has been talking about reducing expenditures.
[00:47:33.622 --> 00:47:38.304]  And also there was an office for special operations and low-intensity conflict.
[00:47:38.864 --> 00:47:43.148]  That is shorthand again for dealing with small wars with terrorists around the world.
[00:47:43.608 --> 00:47:50.594]  So, Building 7 blows up and falls without a plane hitting and it's a giant spook nest, the biggest one in the whole state of New York.
[00:47:52.395 --> 00:47:56.939]  Giant spook nest, and of course another spook nest gets hit with the Office of Homeland Security.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.721]  You see, ladies and gentlemen, this is how they roll, this is how they operate.
[00:48:02.261 --> 00:48:05.301]  Let's play a little piece about the supposed pizza men attackers.
[00:48:05.682 --> 00:48:08.382]  What they do is they find mentally unstable people that are infiltrated.
[00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:22.465]  It's always in and around army bases because this is where you've got the operators that they need to infiltrate the groups and they can contain the disinfo by giving military police the orders to put out the light.
[00:48:23.514 --> 00:48:23.934]  I think so.
[00:48:41.087 --> 00:48:44.609]  For those of you who own television sets, I'm sure yesterday you got quite a start.
[00:49:04.751 --> 00:49:06.673]  First, there is breaking news in New Jersey.
[00:49:06.713 --> 00:49:08.134]  Breaking today, our top story.
[00:49:08.174 --> 00:49:08.775]  Breaking news.
[00:49:08.855 --> 00:49:11.477]  An army base said to be a terror target.
[00:49:11.557 --> 00:49:12.738]  Homegrown terrorists.
[00:49:12.878 --> 00:49:14.239]  Jersey jihadists.
[00:49:15.961 --> 00:49:17.922]  My God, the terrorists have alliteration!
[00:49:19.684 --> 00:49:23.227]  Hey, remember how they said, uh, we're fighting them over there, so we wouldn't have to fight them over here?
[00:49:23.247 --> 00:49:25.889]  Uh, I think that might not have been correct.
[00:49:27.350 --> 00:49:30.653]  Is there any place we can go where we won't have to fight them?
[00:49:30.793 --> 00:49:31.354]  Oh, look, where?
[00:49:31.434 --> 00:49:31.654]  Where?
[00:49:31.814 --> 00:49:32.214]  Montreal?
[00:49:34.286 --> 00:49:39.609]  Anyway, here was... Here was the plan.
[00:49:39.669 --> 00:49:53.717]  Six Islamic radicals, apparently from the former Yugoslavia, were plotting to attack a military base called Fort Dix in New Jersey, seemingly unaware that in this country, that is where we keep most of our weapons and people who understand how to use them.
[00:49:55.638 --> 00:49:57.119]  Seriously, why Fort Dix?
[00:49:57.979 --> 00:50:04.782]  One of the defendants, Mr. Tatar, had delivered pizza there from a family pizzeria for a long period of time.
[00:50:06.102 --> 00:50:10.324]  Yes, the only other target they thought about attacking was the Sigma Nu frat house.
[00:50:12.644 --> 00:50:16.546]  Also big pizza eaters, they called it out though because, quote, those guys were super cool.
[00:50:18.479 --> 00:50:25.942]  Alright, now we know KLA was commanded by Bin Laden, 44 million was sent to attack the Serbs, blow up schools and machine gun school buses.
[00:50:26.242 --> 00:50:31.584]  When the Serbs fought back, we had a big attack and they blew Belgrade to bits and dropped DU all over it and let the Muslims take over.
[00:50:32.905 --> 00:50:34.485]  And they brought a lot of these guys over.
[00:50:34.526 --> 00:50:40.268]  The reason they have every few months a planned attack on an army base is to keep morale up for the troops.
[00:50:40.988 --> 00:50:42.129]  It's all part of the mind control.
[00:50:42.709 --> 00:50:48.592]  This is totally staged, as usual, like everything else, and we'll be right back.
[00:50:49.192 --> 00:50:52.173]  So be sure and stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:52.574 --> 00:50:59.297]  We'll jam in a few calls on the other side, and then get Dr. Nick Buggage on the horn with us from Alaska.
[00:51:04.995 --> 00:51:10.445]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.826 --> 00:51:18.439]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.153 --> 00:51:26.218]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.599 --> 00:51:38.027]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.347 --> 00:51:42.010]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.252]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.572 --> 00:51:48.415]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.747 --> 00:52:02.507]  Terrorism!
[00:52:02.668 --> 00:52:03.388]  Terrorism!
[00:52:03.508 --> 00:52:09.592]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:09.832 --> 00:52:11.433]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:11.673 --> 00:52:14.154]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:14.534 --> 00:52:29.123]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:29.143 --> 00:52:29.463]  government.
[00:52:29.643 --> 00:52:31.444]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:52:31.804 --> 00:52:37.727]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:37.867 --> 00:52:42.369]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[00:53:16.457 --> 00:53:21.361]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.561 --> 00:53:30.508]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:16.194 --> 00:54:18.557]  Greg, John, Kerry, George, we'll get to all of you here in a moment.
[00:54:20.078 --> 00:54:24.143]  We're going to hold off baggage until I get to your calls, but let me explain this.
[00:54:25.686 --> 00:54:29.107]  Government can't just launch massive operations instantly.
[00:54:29.507 --> 00:54:33.588]  That's why it's important that 44,000 and 18,000 British troops and U.S.
[00:54:33.608 --> 00:54:46.570]  troops were massed in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Pakistan in the two months before 9-11 and Bush had launch orders on his desk to launch a full invasion of Afghanistan on his desk two days before and had already signed it.
[00:54:48.991 --> 00:54:49.391]  That's Newsweek!
[00:54:51.323 --> 00:54:53.364]  I mean, was he just going to do it out of the blue?
[00:54:53.584 --> 00:54:53.904]  No!
[00:54:53.964 --> 00:54:55.564]  That's just plain view.
[00:54:55.704 --> 00:54:56.805]  Caught red-handed.
[00:54:57.645 --> 00:54:58.765]  They don't even try to hide it.
[00:54:59.706 --> 00:55:02.266]  Of course they set up Homeland Security before 9-11.
[00:55:02.566 --> 00:55:05.187]  Of course they were gearing up the federal takeover of the society.
[00:55:05.427 --> 00:55:08.148]  That's what we witnessed in the late 90's and warned you about.
[00:55:09.188 --> 00:55:11.649]  They've been setting this stuff up for 30 plus years.
[00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:13.169]  We have the executive orders.
[00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.650]  We have Rex 84.
[00:55:13.690 --> 00:55:14.250]  21 years ago.
[00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:15.570]  Declassified 21 years ago.
[00:55:19.255 --> 00:55:21.356]  We can see the whole thing being built.
[00:55:21.676 --> 00:55:22.877]  Nothing's secret they do.
[00:55:23.077 --> 00:55:27.599]  They may have secret documents we haven't seen and secret commands, but we can see the manifestation.
[00:55:28.319 --> 00:55:30.721]  We can see the intelligence and the orders being given.
[00:55:30.941 --> 00:55:32.681]  We can see the enemy fortification.
[00:55:32.882 --> 00:55:37.784]  We can see the structure we face, the juggernaut, being built.
[00:55:38.487 --> 00:55:41.109]  We can read the manuals that they give their minions.
[00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:46.753]  We can read the watered-down, compartmentalized propaganda that the people putting it together are being given.
[00:55:46.953 --> 00:55:48.274]  We can reverse-engineer it.
[00:55:48.534 --> 00:55:49.475]  It's not very hard.
[00:55:51.736 --> 00:55:53.697]  We can see the signature, the footprints.
[00:55:53.758 --> 00:55:54.438]  We see it!
[00:55:54.558 --> 00:55:55.259]  Plain view!
[00:55:55.319 --> 00:55:57.860]  My gosh, it's out of control, big and bad.
[00:56:01.403 --> 00:56:06.086]  And so, you know, we got audio with Tony Snow, always a White House operative, still a White House operative.
[00:56:07.347 --> 00:56:14.153]  Government back when he was shooting his mouth off, putting out the spin.
[00:56:14.633 --> 00:56:16.875]  We just set up Homeland Security to keep you safe.
[00:56:17.356 --> 00:56:18.537]  Lying, lying.
[00:56:18.737 --> 00:56:19.618]  How many times have you heard that?
[00:56:20.138 --> 00:56:21.199]  Shut up in the wake of 9-11.
[00:56:21.259 --> 00:56:24.362]  Homeland Security keeps America safe.
[00:56:25.002 --> 00:56:27.184]  Folks, they had that sucker shut up in 97 publicly.
[00:56:29.165 --> 00:56:35.989]  And then they put in their bunkers nationwide and the cameras, the cameras at that four-way stop in your one-horse town of 200 people.
[00:56:36.489 --> 00:56:37.690]  That's Homeland Security!
[00:56:39.551 --> 00:56:41.833]  Those cops wearing black riot gear and black masks.
[00:56:42.093 --> 00:56:43.013]  Homeland Security!
[00:56:44.034 --> 00:56:44.954]  Under the federal grants.
[00:56:45.675 --> 00:56:48.497]  That's why you see the same uniform from Russia to the U.S.
[00:56:48.537 --> 00:56:48.997]  It's global.
[00:56:50.638 --> 00:56:50.898]  Folks!
[00:56:52.219 --> 00:56:52.439]  Top!
[00:56:53.835 --> 00:56:57.696]  World Order strategists come up with the black uniforms for intimidation.
[00:56:57.976 --> 00:57:05.279]  By the way, I have Reuters today about Russian police admit that the black uniforms and black masks and Darth Vader outfits are to intimidate.
[00:57:06.099 --> 00:57:08.020]  They say it's to intimidate the public.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.901]  Now see, they're being honest about it.
[00:57:11.981 --> 00:57:13.082]  In fact, that's in my stack.
[00:57:13.122 --> 00:57:15.903]  I should get to that, but I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:57:16.163 --> 00:57:17.563]  We're going to come back and go to your calls.
[00:57:18.183 --> 00:57:19.044]  Jam them in quickly.
[00:57:22.728 --> 00:57:23.488]  We'll see what happens.
[00:57:25.128 --> 00:57:29.389]  I just want to go, because you know, the cops will go, oh no, we wear these Darth Vader outfits for our protection.
[00:57:29.449 --> 00:57:31.630]  Yeah, but the whole design is for intimidation.
[00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:36.190]  I mean, I saw Seattle cops with the beta test in 99.
[00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:38.191]  They actually were wearing black capes.
[00:57:39.311 --> 00:57:41.191]  Black capes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:41.211 --> 00:57:43.732]  I mean, they might as well put Nazgul helmets on.
[00:57:44.032 --> 00:57:51.753]  By the way, I do have Miami police on record wearing hockey masks and now some wear SWAT team outfits they say for intimidation with devil horns.
[00:57:52.606 --> 00:57:58.411]  I mean, folks, when the government starts having its people dress up in demon outfits, I mean, they were doing that 3,000 years ago.
[00:57:58.631 --> 00:58:01.214]  They were doing that 1,000 years ago on the steppes of Russia.
[00:58:03.696 --> 00:58:04.276]  I mean, you know.
[00:58:04.857 --> 00:58:07.059]  I mean, the bad guys dress up like Nazgul, okay?
[00:58:07.279 --> 00:58:10.081]  And when they start dressing up like Nazgul, we're in a lot of trouble!
[00:58:11.142 --> 00:58:14.665]  I mean, it doesn't take a lot to understand bad guys wear black and black masks.
[00:58:15.686 --> 00:58:16.867]  I mean, you ever watch the Western?
[00:58:16.887 --> 00:58:17.808]  Do you understand?
[00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:18.348]  Darth Vader?
[00:58:18.368 --> 00:58:20.170]  Do you understand we're in trouble?
[00:58:21.172 --> 00:58:21.632]  Mayday!
[00:58:21.873 --> 00:58:22.273]  Mayday!
[00:58:22.493 --> 00:58:22.853]  Mayday!
[00:58:23.153 --> 00:58:27.436]  By the way, there's not a lot of Terror Storm left, and when it's sold out, it's gone.
[00:58:27.456 --> 00:58:31.519]  The first edition... We're not gonna offer the first edition anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:36.663]  First edition of Terror Storm, available at Amazon.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:58:37.043 --> 00:58:38.604]  Get it while it's still available.
[00:58:38.644 --> 00:58:39.304]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.646 --> 00:58:46.209]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.093 --> 00:58:58.754]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.394 --> 00:59:00.494]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.155 --> 00:59:02.375]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.935 --> 00:59:03.756]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.496 --> 00:59:06.017]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.057 --> 00:59:10.038]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.238 --> 00:59:14.300]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.962 --> 00:59:24.671]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen now into our number two of this Friday transmission against tyranny Dr. Nick baggage coming out in the next segment right now.
[00:59:24.691 --> 00:59:39.505]  Let's go to Greg in Texas Greg you're on the air welcome I Wanted to what you already gave your take on the foiled terror plot so-called in New Jersey I think it's completely absurd having said that I
[00:59:40.406 --> 00:59:43.988]  Let's play devil's advocate for a second and say that this was really going to happen.
[00:59:44.048 --> 00:59:50.352]  Oh yeah, there are real mentally ill Muslims and there are real suicide bombers and real women that go on buses and stab 15 people to death.
[00:59:50.732 --> 00:59:53.233]  I mean, but this fits the same signature.
[00:59:53.734 --> 01:00:00.577]  I mean, they've done this like six or seven times where they claim guys want to attack military bases and it always turns out none of it was true.
[01:00:01.638 --> 01:00:05.400]  Well, let's pretend they weren't being controlled by suggestions or what have you.
[01:00:05.856 --> 01:00:10.359]  And they're acting on their own, and they were really going to get machine guns and attack this base.
[01:00:10.479 --> 01:00:11.180]  They'd have been dead.
[01:00:13.001 --> 01:00:26.671]  With the Department of Homeland Security and the Patriot Act and the illegal wiretaps and the huge intelligence apparatus can't detect these guys, I think perhaps it's time for them to rethink their approach to the so-called war on terror.
[01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:27.792]  Well, be careful!
[01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:31.635]  They are spinning now that it was human intelligence tattletales at Circuit City that did it.
[01:00:31.915 --> 01:00:32.135]  Right.
[01:00:35.319 --> 01:00:40.865]  Also, did you get that story a few weeks ago about Walmart hiring ex-intelligence agents?
[01:00:41.225 --> 01:00:56.001]  Well, we told you that five years ago, we learned it, it came out in the news a few years ago, the FBI and Homeland Security runs their Fayetteville, Arkansas compound, and it's actually, the whole thing's a military front.
[01:00:56.906 --> 01:01:02.047]  I mean, that's why they work with the military to force the RFID, to force universal product code.
[01:01:03.008 --> 01:01:05.668]  I mean, all of it is a deal with China to de-industrialize.
[01:01:06.028 --> 01:01:09.849]  It's a military-industrial complex economy wrecking ball.
[01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:17.291]  I thought that it smacked of Henry Ford and how he ran Ford Motor Company back in the 30s.
[01:01:17.331 --> 01:01:20.292]  Yeah, he had guys that if you struck, they'd go out and shoot you in the street.
[01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:23.213]  I've got film footage of them shooting strikers.
[01:01:25.377 --> 01:01:29.904]  I think a lot of it is probably anti-union strategy.
[01:01:31.246 --> 01:01:34.791]  You know, for them to record conversations and figure out who's trying to organize.
[01:01:34.811 --> 01:01:40.199]  No, no, I understand that, but listen, I'm not just saying that Walmart is a government front.
[01:01:41.076 --> 01:01:41.956]  Nothing that big.
[01:01:42.136 --> 01:01:43.257]  It's the biggest corporation.
[01:01:43.277 --> 01:01:43.977]  It's number two now.
[01:01:44.017 --> 01:01:47.398]  ExxonMobil has been raping so much with the oil that it's number two.
[01:01:48.018 --> 01:01:49.699]  But Walmart, sir, is global.
[01:01:49.979 --> 01:01:51.319]  It's over strategic trade.
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:59.122]  Believe me, they have drills about how to use their warehouse facilities to put people in them.
[01:01:59.722 --> 01:02:01.342]  I knew that before it even got in the news.
[01:02:01.382 --> 01:02:05.384]  My point is that we've gotten that from people and announced it before it was even in the news.
[01:02:05.764 --> 01:02:10.005]  They have the drills where you have the mass inoculation drills in the Walmart parking lot.
[01:02:10.715 --> 01:02:13.938]  Walmart is now like 37% of world retail sales.
[01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:16.340]  It's a fascist organization.
[01:02:18.322 --> 01:02:19.242]  Yeah, well, I get that.
[01:02:19.463 --> 01:02:22.525]  I mean, you know, they're politics and what have you.
[01:02:23.746 --> 01:02:26.789]  But I had no idea that they were that deeply embedded.
[01:02:29.131 --> 01:02:30.552]  Sir, they are a black op.
[01:02:30.612 --> 01:02:33.394]  They've been a black op for at least the last 10 years.
[01:02:35.676 --> 01:02:35.916]  Wow.
[01:02:36.717 --> 01:02:37.718]  Well, that's all I've got.
[01:02:39.085 --> 01:02:40.385]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:40.425 --> 01:02:43.126]  The globalists aren't going to leave anything up to chance.
[01:02:44.207 --> 01:02:44.607]  Okay?
[01:02:45.987 --> 01:03:01.112]  That's why Walmart never gets fined, always gets left alone, is allowed to do whatever it wants with importation, actually owns over 700 slave camps in China, and that's where the kids go to school a few hours a day, and then they go over the rest of the day for 10 hours to work in the factories.
[01:03:01.132 --> 01:03:04.393]  I mean, this is just unspeakable, folks.
[01:03:05.183 --> 01:03:14.170]  I might go on Walmart once a year when I'm in an emergency out of town and it's the only thing I can find and I've got to go buy video tapes or batteries or something and they've got a 24-hour Walmart.
[01:03:15.511 --> 01:03:19.154]  Now, by the way, Target is an intelligence front.
[01:03:19.594 --> 01:03:30.082]  And by the way, we knew this from Target and high-level Target people and now it's come out that their real business is intelligence and selling software and surveillance systems to the federal government.
[01:03:31.603 --> 01:03:32.344]  Just type in
[01:03:33.627 --> 01:03:38.013]  Target Intelligence Agency, or Target Surveillance Technologies.
[01:03:38.673 --> 01:03:41.717]  They actually, uh, it's Defense Department folks.
[01:03:42.358 --> 01:03:43.800]  Target, Walmart, all of it.
[01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:45.882]  Okay, I'm sorry to have to give you the news.
[01:03:46.603 --> 01:03:48.405]  It is so much worse than you were told.
[01:03:48.866 --> 01:03:49.507]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.895 --> 01:04:02.385]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.745 --> 01:04:10.398]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:18.124]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:18.524 --> 01:04:29.929]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.249 --> 01:04:33.911]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:34.231 --> 01:04:36.152]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:36.492 --> 01:04:40.334]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.835 --> 01:04:56.717]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:04:57.077 --> 01:04:59.940]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:06.384]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:57.807]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:05:58.007 --> 01:06:02.169]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:06:02.769 --> 01:06:07.651]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:06:08.151 --> 01:06:14.594]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[01:06:15.325 --> 01:06:18.026]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:06:18.186 --> 01:06:28.150]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:32.131]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:06:32.191 --> 01:06:38.674]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:06:38.854 --> 01:06:39.894]  Are you ready to go solar?
[01:06:40.094 --> 01:06:41.055]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[01:06:44.956 --> 01:06:49.018]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSoler.com.

[01:06:53.901 --> 01:07:01.685]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.705 --> 01:07:05.047]  Dr. Nick Begich will be with us till the bottom of the next hour.
[01:07:05.107 --> 01:07:10.310]  Then we've got Jesse Trinidou, his brother, was murdered by the FBI.
[01:07:11.613 --> 01:07:14.275]  And this blew up with the whole Oklahoma City bombing cover-up.
[01:07:14.695 --> 01:07:16.036]  Big new developments there.
[01:07:16.457 --> 01:07:19.339]  Joining us the last 30 minutes of the transmission today.
[01:07:19.799 --> 01:07:21.961]  We'll tell you more about that real fast.
[01:07:22.381 --> 01:07:26.584]  Lucas in Texas says he's got some big smoking gun on Oklahoma City.
[01:07:27.244 --> 01:07:32.948]  Then I want to go to our guest Nick Begistin to John and Kelly and Kerry and George and everybody else that's holding.
[01:07:33.609 --> 01:07:34.790]  But Lucas, go ahead.
[01:07:34.830 --> 01:07:35.710]  What's the smoking gun?
[01:07:35.951 --> 01:07:36.751]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[01:07:37.071 --> 01:07:40.614]  Well, hey, I found out we started, Dylan and I were trying to identify
[01:07:41.363 --> 01:07:45.245]  Some airplane parts from 9-11 that led me down a different road.
[01:07:45.265 --> 01:07:50.488]  You know how they identified Timothy McVeigh, you know, within an hour?
[01:07:50.928 --> 01:07:55.710]  Because they said they traced the numbers on the axle back to that particular rider truck.
[01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:57.131]  It's impossible.
[01:07:57.611 --> 01:07:58.952]  I just got off the phone with GM.
[01:07:59.612 --> 01:08:04.855]  There is no way to trace a particular truck by any numbers on any axle.
[01:08:05.195 --> 01:08:08.517]  They can find out the make and model, or they can find out what
[01:08:09.488 --> 01:08:11.290]  With possible truck it may have come from.
[01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:12.371]  Well of course they're lying.
[01:08:12.411 --> 01:08:13.412]  They carried out the bombing.
[01:08:13.432 --> 01:08:14.433]  But yeah, that's a good point.
[01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:20.058]  You know, there's no possible way they could have traced it back to Timothy McVeigh using that Ryder truck.
[01:08:20.098 --> 01:08:20.759]  It's impossible.
[01:08:21.659 --> 01:08:27.425]  And that's basically... Which shows within literal minutes they were already saying it was him.
[01:08:27.485 --> 01:08:29.407]  So again, more staged events.
[01:08:30.157 --> 01:08:38.600]  Yeah, I mean, like I said, you can trace it back to, let's say it came from a GMC truck, but there's no identification that ties it back to the VIN number.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:43.081]  No, I understand it would be a general part number, not a VIN number on the actual vehicle.
[01:08:43.481 --> 01:08:44.021]  Exactly.
[01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:48.823]  That's only in two places, generally, with a vehicle.
[01:08:49.083 --> 01:08:55.445]  Listen, write that up, send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com with your discussion with them, and we'll get it posted.
[01:08:55.825 --> 01:08:56.525]  Alright, great, thanks.
[01:08:56.885 --> 01:08:58.386]  God bless you, I appreciate that, Lucas.
[01:08:59.349 --> 01:09:05.774]  Okay, Dr. Nick Baggage, you know, he's got a lengthy bio and his website is earthpulse.com.
[01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:17.643]  We carry his amazing book on mind control and also his video on mind control, and we'll tell you more about those later, but there's the details at infowarriors.com right now.
[01:09:18.003 --> 01:09:20.325]  Dr. Nick Baggage, his father, of course, is a congressman.
[01:09:20.385 --> 01:09:23.167]  His brother is a prominent mayor in Alaska.
[01:09:23.588 --> 01:09:27.811]  He's executive director of the Lay Institute, the Lay Potato Chip Family, five in the world order.
[01:09:29.111 --> 01:09:30.852]  A Texas non-profit corporation.
[01:09:30.892 --> 01:09:35.973]  He is also the publisher and the co-owner of Earth Pulse Press Incorporated, an Alaskan-based organization.
[01:09:36.314 --> 01:09:38.474]  Dr. Begich is the eldest son of the late U.S.
[01:09:38.514 --> 01:09:41.555]  Congressman from Alaska, Nick Begich Sr.
[01:09:41.855 --> 01:09:43.816]  and political activist Peggy Begich.
[01:09:44.236 --> 01:09:46.857]  He has also entered Alaska for his own political activities.
[01:09:47.157 --> 01:09:52.319]  He was twice elected president of both the Alaskan Federation of Teachers and the Anchorage Council of Education.
[01:09:52.719 --> 01:09:56.740]  He has been pursuing independent research in the sciences and politics for most of his life.
[01:09:57.484 --> 01:10:04.129]  And he received his doctorate in traditional medicine from the Open International University of Complementary Medicines in 1994.
[01:10:04.189 --> 01:10:10.133]  He co-authored the Gene Manning book, Angels Don't Play This Harp, Advanced Technologies in Tesla.
[01:10:10.613 --> 01:10:17.078]  Begich has also authored Earth Rising 1 and 2, and it goes on and on and on.
[01:10:17.618 --> 01:10:18.158]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:10:38.384 --> 01:10:49.068]  Dr. Nick Baggage, it is great to have you on with us today, joining us from Anchorage, and he sounds great, he's not on telephone, he's on digital line, because he's a talk show host right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:10:49.388 --> 01:10:50.448]  Doc, good to have you on with us.
[01:10:50.648 --> 01:10:54.849]  Hey, it's always good to be back with you, Alex, and I'm glad to be part of the same network.
[01:10:54.909 --> 01:11:02.752]  It's given us a whole lot more opportunity to get the word out on these issues, and we appreciate it, and we appreciate being on with you today.
[01:11:03.527 --> 01:11:05.668]  Well, I have all that back at you.
[01:11:05.808 --> 01:11:21.553]  Look, I just want to talk about, out of the gate, just give us a thumbnail of some of the issues you think are most important that you want to talk about, but then I first want to get into the Virginia shooting, and it had a lot of telltale signs of a black op, of at least provocateur, if not mind control.
[01:11:21.853 --> 01:11:28.635]  I wanted you to go over the admissions of these patented technologies with electronics and drugs, and a combination of those.
[01:11:28.955 --> 01:11:30.556]  Then I wanted to talk about your take
[01:11:31.056 --> 01:11:39.841]  On the massive honeybee die-off that's not happening in organic or natural colonies, the type that aren't being cultured.
[01:11:40.541 --> 01:11:52.827]  And then I'd like to get into what you think is really happening with global climate change and what you think real threats from your decades of study and conferring with many other experts are.
[01:11:52.887 --> 01:11:56.149]  So those three main areas first, if we can.
[01:11:56.209 --> 01:11:59.931]  But first, tell us later what you'd like to get into, what you think is most important.
[01:12:00.453 --> 01:12:08.164]  Well, you know, one of the things that's happening here that a lot of people are totally unaware of is we have a huge oil and gas scandal brewing.
[01:12:08.445 --> 01:12:16.456]  Two people just pleaded guilty to bribery, conspiracy up here, and they actually are arguing over
[01:12:17.157 --> 01:12:22.081]  The tax take on the last and largest oil and gas fields in the country.
[01:12:22.121 --> 01:12:23.762]  So really important stuff.
[01:12:23.802 --> 01:12:25.924]  It's going to probably implicate U.S.
[01:12:25.964 --> 01:12:27.405]  Senator Ted Stevens.
[01:12:27.425 --> 01:12:31.188]  His son is mentioned in these latest indictments.
[01:12:31.268 --> 01:12:32.429]  There's three new indictments.
[01:12:32.569 --> 01:12:35.011]  One with a seated legislator.
[01:12:36.092 --> 01:12:37.053]  Man, it's a big one.
[01:12:37.273 --> 01:12:43.958]  By the way, the evidence really points towards your father being killed in that mysterious plane crash in uncovering similar things.
[01:12:44.278 --> 01:13:09.646]  That's right and you know that the corruption in government really hasn't changed and I think you know that this whole discussion things that we're going to talk about today are the take look at Nixon's administration what was happening then nothing different than what's happening today in this administration the only difference is the scale and the scale and technology that allows them to go a million miles further in the wrong direction and this is why
[01:13:10.226 --> 01:13:19.757]  For me, the mind control issue, the issue that we're going to be talking about a little bit today, is in fact the most important issue on the table, because it's about freedom of the mind.
[01:13:19.877 --> 01:13:21.899]  Free will is at stake.
[01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:27.926]  And we know, I mean, everyone knows around the world that even God doesn't interfere with free will.
[01:13:28.026 --> 01:13:29.768]  And this is the direction
[01:13:30.408 --> 01:13:37.855]  Of both our government and many others, and I think part of the root of a New World Order is a slave class, and that's us.
[01:13:37.975 --> 01:13:41.678]  And we need to do what we can to avoid this otherwise eventuality.
[01:13:41.978 --> 01:13:43.820]  And let's get into mind control right now.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:49.524]  I just want to add though, every week we have someone who's lost a mother, a father, a brother, a husband to the New World Order.
[01:13:49.925 --> 01:13:53.608]  That's why I tell people out there, this isn't a game, this isn't a joke.
[01:13:54.288 --> 01:13:56.149]  Dr. Baggage has a lot of courage to do what he does.
[01:13:56.269 --> 01:13:58.010]  I do what I do because I've counted the cost.
[01:13:58.310 --> 01:14:01.631]  And I want listeners to not be afraid themselves because you're small fish, folks.
[01:14:02.011 --> 01:14:03.072]  We're on the front lines.
[01:14:03.112 --> 01:14:04.072]  We're walking point.
[01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:12.415]  And I just want you to always remember that this isn't about a social click or a club or a lot of people think this is fun and it's all dandy.
[01:14:12.675 --> 01:14:13.856]  This is about survival.
[01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:17.318]  What we do here literally is look in death in the eye every day.
[01:14:17.718 --> 01:14:21.019]  But we do it because we've counted the cost and we don't want to live as slaves.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:24.361]  And we're doing what people have always done to try to make the future better.
[01:14:24.861 --> 01:14:30.044]  We're standing up and trying to make the world a better place by confronting evil.
[01:14:30.224 --> 01:14:36.867]  And history shows that if you don't confront evil, it feeds on the mass and literally things are much worse for everyone.
[01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:40.489]  And we know it's safer to confront them than not confront them.
[01:14:40.529 --> 01:14:42.690]  But I think people need to realize, Dr. Baggage,
[01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.431]  And I'm not tooting our horns here.
[01:14:44.451 --> 01:14:46.251]  I want people to know, this is a war!
[01:14:46.972 --> 01:14:47.532]  Absolutely.
[01:14:47.592 --> 01:14:49.233]  In fact, the stakes are high.
[01:14:49.273 --> 01:14:53.334]  You know, and right now, what we're seeing, at least in our part of the world, is some hope.
[01:14:53.535 --> 01:14:56.736]  I mean, we watched a 20-year U.S.
[01:14:56.776 --> 01:15:04.999]  Senator, an incumbent Governor, get wiped out by an ethical candidate, an unknown candidate, in a primary, a three-way primary up here.
[01:15:05.039 --> 01:15:07.801]  The woman was outspent, outmaneuvered, out everything.
[01:15:09.281 --> 01:15:13.925]  This state started to shift that direction towards an ethical government.
[01:15:13.945 --> 01:15:19.949]  And we see Ron Paul exploding and winning all the polls, and I just got a Newsweek in here, doesn't even have his name in it.
[01:15:20.169 --> 01:15:22.771]  They're universally blacking him out because they're scared.
[01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:36.560]  Yeah, you know, this is the problem with the establishment, is they're being challenged all around the world, and every single soul that does a step, any step, I mean, each of us have our own circle of influence, whether it's our families, friends,
[01:15:37.060 --> 01:15:45.803]  Take the time and start registering your concerns about some of these issues, because the only way it's going to shift the other direction is when the momentum turns.
[01:15:45.863 --> 01:15:46.924]  And we still have a chance.
[01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:50.725]  I think we still have a very good chance to beat some of this back.
[01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:53.446]  Well, we stand on the shoulders of people like your father.
[01:15:54.053 --> 01:15:56.254]  Well, and you know, there's a lot of good people out there.
[01:15:56.314 --> 01:16:02.936]  Unfortunately, they're not making it into government as we'd like to see them, and it's something that we need to change.
[01:16:02.956 --> 01:16:09.398]  You know, we need to look around our communities and start recruiting those people that we know are of character and helping them get involved.
[01:16:09.678 --> 01:16:18.941]  You know, it's not going to happen by standing still, and I think the step of faith is stepping into what we know to be right and true and acting on it, and each of us can do that in our own ways.
[01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:20.141]  Absolutely.
[01:16:20.221 --> 01:16:26.183]  I think the way to get into Virginia is, instead of going over all the tell-tale signs of black ops, mind control.
[01:16:26.243 --> 01:16:28.743]  I mean, this is a highly developed science.
[01:16:28.823 --> 01:16:31.804]  I don't think really there's anyone out there who's done, who isn't involved in it.
[01:16:32.124 --> 01:16:32.984]  More study on it.
[01:16:33.164 --> 01:16:35.185]  You've written a book, made a film about the subject.
[01:16:35.205 --> 01:16:36.185]  You've written several books on it.
[01:16:36.845 --> 01:16:39.586]  Go over that, just in a nutshell for us, some of the history of it.
[01:16:39.606 --> 01:16:41.626]  Then we're going to go to break in a few minutes and we'll just continue.
[01:16:41.926 --> 01:16:42.527]  All right, great.
[01:16:42.627 --> 01:16:45.249]  And I also want to make sure we mention this conference we held.
[01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:49.573]  We brought together seven of the best scientists in the world on this subject just a few months ago.
[01:16:49.633 --> 01:16:58.861]  But the background of this, going back historically, starts of course with hypnotism as one of the original mind control techniques.
[01:16:58.981 --> 01:17:02.684]  In the Harvard labs in the 1920s, a guy named George Estabrooks
[01:17:03.184 --> 01:17:08.126]  was heavily involved in this to create what we would call today a Manchurian candidate.
[01:17:08.246 --> 01:17:15.888]  His idea was to bring someone to such a deep hypnotic state as to fracture the personality into two very distinct individuals.
[01:17:16.388 --> 01:17:19.909]  One with full knowledge of the other and the other with no knowledge of anything.
[01:17:20.009 --> 01:17:24.890]  So you could send them into the Soviet Union in those days or some other place on the planet.
[01:17:24.930 --> 01:17:30.212]  They could act as a super spy and if they got caught they'd have no recollection of their true identity.
[01:17:30.652 --> 01:17:31.674]  How did you get started?
[01:17:49.135 --> 01:18:13.569]  came out in 1947 and then his book in 1961, which was really about the evolution of the human mind, was an amazing book because it talked about the use of things like LSD as a drug for psychiatric patients, you know, and that was the time, jumping ahead a little bit, where MKUltra was involved in that exact same research.
[01:18:13.609 --> 01:18:18.052]  In fact, when you analyze Esther Brooks' reading, writing rather, against the
[01:18:18.712 --> 01:18:22.197]  When we get back, we're going to go over this, because this is real, and this is a science.
[01:18:36.796 --> 01:18:40.018]  And it's been brought to very high levels right now.
[01:18:40.618 --> 01:18:42.499]  And you can learn to see the tell-tale signs.
[01:18:42.879 --> 01:18:48.481]  There's also the lighter form of just group mind control and the mass hypnotism going on through the television sets.
[01:18:48.901 --> 01:18:50.142]  Dr. Nick Beggett, straight ahead.
[01:18:56.092 --> 01:19:00.233]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:19:00.454 --> 01:19:02.214]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:19:02.474 --> 01:19:08.756]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:19:09.057 --> 01:19:15.179]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:19:15.419 --> 01:19:21.441]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:19:21.741 --> 01:19:23.363]  With no side effects.
[01:19:23.383 --> 01:19:28.148]  The 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:19:28.308 --> 01:19:31.852]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:19:32.133 --> 01:19:35.857]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:19:36.037 --> 01:19:38.580]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:39.761]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.063]  Eliminate the cause!

[01:19:54.844 --> 01:19:56.646]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.706 --> 01:20:01.090]  On May 10, 2007, Gold Spot 673.80 and 1 oz gold coins can be purchased for $694.62, $349.76 for half, and $174.88 for quarter oz coins at $694.62, $349.76, and $174.88.
[01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:17.603]  There has been talk coming from the Council of Foreign Relations of forming an American Union combining Canada, Mexico and the U.S.
[01:20:17.703 --> 01:20:19.104]  and erasing economic borders.
[01:20:19.324 --> 01:20:26.086]  Bush met with Vincent Fox, President of Mexico, Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, discussing a security and prosperity partnership.
[01:20:26.287 --> 01:20:29.828]  The formation of a North American Union will have a great impact on the U.S.
[01:20:29.888 --> 01:20:30.368]  economy.
[01:20:30.628 --> 01:20:35.370]  Jerome R. Corsi published the document, The Plan to Replace the Dollar with the Emerald.
[01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:37.011]  The sovereignty of the U.S.
[01:20:37.271 --> 01:20:37.991]  is under attack.
[01:20:38.451 --> 01:20:41.797]  And Corsi uncovers the secrets and lies that surround the deceit.
[01:20:42.097 --> 01:20:43.319]  Call for your copy today 800-686-2237.
[01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:44.741]  We the people must take a stand.
[01:20:44.801 --> 01:20:45.162]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:45.222 --> 01:20:45.522]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.863 --> 01:20:54.644]  Terrorism!
[01:20:54.784 --> 01:20:55.544]  Terrorism!
[01:20:55.644 --> 01:21:01.709]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:21:01.949 --> 01:21:03.571]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:06.273]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:21:06.673 --> 01:21:21.244]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:21:21.264 --> 01:21:21.604]  government.
[01:21:21.765 --> 01:21:23.526]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:21:23.926 --> 01:21:29.849]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:21:29.989 --> 01:21:34.472]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:21:53.448 --> 01:21:54.289]  Attention gardeners!
[01:21:54.349 --> 01:21:56.712]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[01:21:56.952 --> 01:22:01.296]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers and herbs.
[01:22:01.477 --> 01:22:09.365]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[01:22:09.685 --> 01:22:12.506]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[01:22:12.786 --> 01:22:20.329]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[01:22:20.409 --> 01:22:26.011]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[01:22:26.251 --> 01:22:31.813]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[01:22:32.073 --> 01:22:35.395]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[01:22:35.635 --> 01:22:38.976]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[01:22:39.216 --> 01:22:44.262]  GCN listeners who want to grow dirt cheap superfood should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[01:22:44.282 --> 01:22:47.145]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:22:47.205 --> 01:22:47.386]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:18.838]  By the way, I myself have gotten so conditioned to the martial law, MIT-designed control grid going on around us that I didn't even cover this yesterday at the end of the show, or so far.
[01:23:18.858 --> 01:23:25.243]  Bush changes continuity plan, administration not DHS, would run shadow government.
[01:23:25.983 --> 01:23:31.027]  Just Washington Post, got LA Times calling it shadow government, but they're reporting on it as if it's good.
[01:23:31.567 --> 01:23:33.989]  Oh yeah, the shadow government's doing quite nicely right now.
[01:23:34.878 --> 01:23:35.981]  Tells Congress what to do.
[01:23:36.061 --> 01:23:37.244]  Tells the courts what to do.
[01:23:37.264 --> 01:23:38.828]  It's building FEMA camps.
[01:23:39.069 --> 01:23:39.870]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:23:40.813 --> 01:23:41.935]  Going back to Dr. Nick Baggage.
[01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:44.972]  Continuing with mind control.
[01:23:45.352 --> 01:23:46.973]  You know, you're going over the history.
[01:23:47.053 --> 01:23:49.135]  We should probably also get into the different types.
[01:23:49.155 --> 01:23:51.937]  Because basic peer pressure is a form of mind control.
[01:23:51.957 --> 01:23:52.538]  One of the strongest.
[01:23:52.558 --> 01:23:53.338]  We are mammals.
[01:23:53.618 --> 01:24:00.344]  You know, your dog is under mind control to try to please you by its own genetic code and brain makeup.
[01:24:00.644 --> 01:24:03.286]  And of course, we're very similar to that as the canines familiar us.
[01:24:03.706 --> 01:24:05.668]  But please continue, Doctor, with the history.
[01:24:06.048 --> 01:24:24.663]  Yeah, going back to MKUltra, the publication, June 1975, report to the President by the Commission on CI Activities within the United States, on pages 225 and on, they start talking about the use of LSD and other hallucinogenics, various types of mind control that started
[01:24:25.143 --> 01:24:46.060]  by observations in the Soviet bloc countries is what this says based on drugs or hypnosis and just before we were talking about George Estabrook's ideas about this in terms of behavior modification think about it for a moment people involved in science suggesting that these kinds of drugs be used for psychiatric treatment and it was later that we found out
[01:24:46.756 --> 01:25:08.946]  uh... that there was uh... a guy named cameron in the uh... uh... canada that was actually working with the state-run psychiatric hospitals uh... under contract with the c i a doing uh... exactly this actually abusing uh... there was uh... eighty cases settled by the canadian government and by the c i a owing camera and i i i i i knew about that but then the ship
[01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:13.128]  Five or six years ago on History Channel, a whole special.
[01:25:13.388 --> 01:25:13.588]  Right.
[01:25:13.728 --> 01:25:24.914]  And about how they would like tell people they're going in for psychiatric treatment and take them to Canada and for six months with audio and brainwashing and peyote, PCP, LSD cocktails and they were making whole new people.
[01:25:25.354 --> 01:25:26.475]  Right, exactly right.
[01:25:26.575 --> 01:25:30.078]  And there's actually some cases starting to be resurrected in this area.
[01:25:30.158 --> 01:25:44.571]  The only case that ever got settled in the United States, according to this report to the President, was one case where one of the people involved in the program was given LSD, he was escorted by CIA escort to New York, and mysteriously jumped out of a building.
[01:25:44.611 --> 01:25:45.072]  And although
[01:25:45.612 --> 01:25:46.633]  They did settle that.
[01:25:47.773 --> 01:25:49.334]  Eventually, the CIA settled it.
[01:25:49.374 --> 01:25:54.797]  There's still, to this day, strong indication that he didn't fall out of that building or jump.
[01:25:54.857 --> 01:25:57.258]  He was pushed out of that building to shut him up.
[01:25:57.998 --> 01:26:01.380]  What was really going on, they shredded, according to this presidential report...
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:02.200]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:20.843 --> 01:26:34.113]  All of the parallel programs they needed to initiate the CIA activity, stuff that you couldn't get done in the mainstream academic arenas at that time, all the time, because the mavericks were sort of outside of the institution.
[01:26:34.153 --> 01:26:37.455]  So they had these so-called non-profits.
[01:26:37.495 --> 01:26:39.737]  That one was run by a guy named Schleicher who was
[01:26:40.517 --> 01:26:43.318]  in the Navy for 40 years, the whole time he ran the place.
[01:26:43.718 --> 01:26:47.820]  The Navy, interestingly enough, shows back up on the scene more recently.
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:27:07.926]  We have posted on our website their new protocol on human experimentation which is dated November 6, 2006 and what it suggests and what it says boldly on page 9 is that the Undersecretary of the Navy is the one who has to authorize all, and they use these words, mind control experiments
[01:27:08.426 --> 01:27:09.066]  Humorous!
[01:27:24.774 --> 01:27:31.857]  An RFP, a Request for Proposal, that was issued by the Air Force Research Laboratories.
[01:27:31.957 --> 01:27:39.120]  The announcement title is, Research in Support of Directed Energy Bioeffects Division of the Human Effectiveness Directorate.
[01:27:39.561 --> 01:27:44.023]  And it's their contract announcement BAA 0505 HE.
[01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:49.645]  And it doesn't close until September of 2009, over two years away.
[01:27:49.725 --> 01:27:51.406]  And this is what it's asking for.
[01:27:52.026 --> 01:28:06.376]  The ultimate goal, and I'm quoting, the ultimate goal of such research is to develop a fully articulated theory with supporting predictive models, which will facilitate the inducement of desired behavioral effects in individuals and groups through the use of non-lethal weapons.
[01:28:06.776 --> 01:28:09.498]  And this is their next big solicitation.
[01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:14.341]  That's a complete admission of mass general population civilian mind control.
[01:28:14.701 --> 01:28:16.583]  Absolutely, and there's more.
[01:28:16.683 --> 01:28:19.865]  I mean, Justice's Department... Stay there, let's keep walking through what these
[01:28:20.465 --> 01:28:21.066]  People are doing.
[01:28:21.086 --> 01:28:27.171]  And by the way, if they're openly now announcing it, you can bet it's on the shelf, workable models.
[01:28:27.732 --> 01:28:29.433]  This is just going to be the implementation.
[01:28:30.474 --> 01:28:39.382]  And I remember a few years ago, it was in the Baltimore Sun, DARPA just said, oh yeah, we're working on mind control waves to calm the cities.
[01:28:40.103 --> 01:28:41.924]  Everything will be all right soon.
[01:28:44.206 --> 01:28:45.147]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.167 --> 01:28:47.089]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.092 --> 01:28:50.853]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.514 --> 01:28:56.994]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:28:57.674 --> 01:29:00.575]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[01:29:00.595 --> 01:29:06.277]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:29:07.237 --> 01:29:12.178]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[01:29:13.238 --> 01:29:15.059]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:29:15.459 --> 01:29:16.239]  There may be more.
[01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:24.216]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:32.763]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:33.603 --> 01:29:35.164]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:48.220]  Call now!
[01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:51.201]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.

[01:29:57.944 --> 01:29:58.824]  Look no further!
[01:29:59.104 --> 01:30:01.665]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:30:02.105 --> 01:30:10.548]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.

[01:30:25.104 --> 01:30:28.188]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[01:30:28.268 --> 01:30:28.568]  I think so.
[01:30:54.795 --> 01:30:58.557]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:30:58.937 --> 01:31:06.262]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:31:06.702 --> 01:31:17.648]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:18.188]  Central.
[01:31:18.549 --> 01:31:24.132]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:31:24.472 --> 01:31:30.374]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:31:30.854 --> 01:31:35.596]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:31:35.996 --> 01:31:40.778]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:31:41.218 --> 01:31:42.519]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:31:42.579 --> 01:31:42.999]  Central.
[01:31:43.579 --> 01:31:51.002]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:32:19.857 --> 01:32:21.419]  Dr. Nick Begich is our guest.
[01:32:21.459 --> 01:32:27.048]  The video, Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance.
[01:32:28.044 --> 01:32:28.544]  I've watched it.
[01:32:28.584 --> 01:32:29.144]  It's excellent.
[01:32:29.164 --> 01:32:29.725]  We carry it.
[01:32:29.785 --> 01:32:32.886]  His book on mind control is amazing as well.
[01:32:33.106 --> 01:32:38.048]  And they're available right now at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free.
[01:32:38.088 --> 01:32:39.688]  You can get them individually or together.
[01:32:39.708 --> 01:32:39.768]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:32:49.719 --> 01:32:57.923]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, you can call toll-free and get the video, Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance.
[01:32:58.543 --> 01:33:11.250]  It is so important that you get this new video, Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance, or the book, Controlling the Human Mind, The Technologies of Political Control, or Tools for Peak Performance.
[01:33:12.250 --> 01:33:15.432]  The video, Mind Control, A Brave New World, or Enhancing Human Performance,
[01:33:16.204 --> 01:33:21.428]  And the book, Controlling the Human Mind, The Technologies for Political Control or Tools for Peak Performance.
[01:33:22.069 --> 01:33:24.971]  And they're both amazing books and videos.
[01:33:25.331 --> 01:33:26.312]  I have learned so much here.
[01:33:26.332 --> 01:33:27.653]  And again, I know quite a bit.
[01:33:27.693 --> 01:33:29.054]  I've been studying this for a long time.
[01:33:29.595 --> 01:33:33.017]  But he gets into the documents themselves and has found out so much that I didn't know.
[01:33:33.498 --> 01:33:34.539]  And it's such a big area.
[01:33:34.599 --> 01:33:38.122]  Just, I mean, you know, they have billions and billions spent every year publicly.
[01:33:38.342 --> 01:33:39.503]  Who knows how much secretly?
[01:33:39.963 --> 01:33:43.466]  I guarantee you there's nobody in the government that knows about all of it, even all the projects.
[01:33:44.006 --> 01:33:46.907]  Just the stuff they admit now is just off the charts.
[01:33:46.947 --> 01:33:49.848]  So again, Controlling the Human Mind is the book.
[01:33:50.368 --> 01:33:52.149]  And again, Mind Control is the video.
[01:33:53.529 --> 01:33:57.011]  Big discount when you get them both together at Infowars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:33:57.691 --> 01:34:02.212]  You can also write to me on Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:34:11.033 --> 01:34:15.275]  And you support us by getting the books and videos, and you also support the great work of Dr. Nick Begich.
[01:34:15.715 --> 01:34:26.460]  By the way, there's only less than a thousand left at Amazon.com, less than a thousand left in my office, the two places that have got them, of Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror, the first cut.
[01:34:27.521 --> 01:34:33.804]  A new cut is coming out in late July, so you've got two months to get it, and it probably won't be around in just a few weeks.
[01:34:34.404 --> 01:34:38.426]  Get the original of Terror Storm if you want that collector's item, plus it's a good film.
[01:34:39.717 --> 01:34:44.241]  An excellent film before the second edition that has 17 minutes extra comes out.
[01:34:44.721 --> 01:34:48.985]  Get the original Terror Storm, ladies and gentlemen, at InfoWars.com.
[01:34:49.005 --> 01:34:49.846]  It's been discounted.
[01:34:50.692 --> 01:34:53.953]  And also, you can get it at Amazon.com, where it's been discounted.
[01:34:54.293 --> 01:34:55.833]  Terror Storm, the first edition.
[01:34:56.274 --> 01:35:02.835]  There will never be any more of these from this office, or from Amazon, coming up in just a few months.
[01:35:03.295 --> 01:35:05.856]  So again, InfoWars.com, or you can also write to us.
[01:35:06.296 --> 01:35:08.357]  Again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:08.517 --> 01:35:11.378]  And our guest website, of course, is EarthPulse.com, EarthPulse.com.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:22.061]  We have links to that up on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:22.521 --> 01:35:24.122]  I know we've got a lot of callers holding.
[01:35:24.403 --> 01:35:26.184]  Dr. Begg is going to talk about any subject you want.
[01:35:26.444 --> 01:35:27.364]  We're going to get to you.
[01:35:27.444 --> 01:35:31.106]  I appreciate you being patient.
[01:35:31.126 --> 01:35:31.347]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:31.627 --> 01:35:37.010]  Before we shift gears into the environment and the honeybees and what's really threatening the earth and the people.
[01:35:37.933 --> 01:35:41.336]  No doubt there's problems, but what's this real global tax about?
[01:35:41.376 --> 01:35:42.356]  That's of course a fraud.
[01:35:43.077 --> 01:35:46.980]  Before we shift gears into that in a few minutes, we'll go to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:48.221 --> 01:35:57.348]  But going back to Dr. Nick Baggett's continuing with the history and what they admit and these new, just amazing announcements and pronouncements of open mind control.
[01:35:57.948 --> 01:36:05.274]  There's a really important publication, June 2004, from the Air Force Research Laboratories.
[01:36:05.354 --> 01:36:10.538]  It's in their publication, Technology Horizons, Research for the American Future.
[01:36:10.578 --> 01:36:19.085]  The lead article is called, Controlled Effects, and it's written by the Air Force Directed Energy Directorate at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico.
[01:36:19.105 --> 01:36:24.049]  I'm just going to read a couple of quotes that just grab the whole deal right in a nutshell.
[01:36:24.069 --> 01:36:25.010]  The first one is,
[01:36:25.410 --> 01:36:39.473]  With the advent of directed energy and other revolutionary technologies, the ability to instantaneously project very precise amounts of various types of energy anywhere in the world can become a reality.
[01:36:39.513 --> 01:36:40.873]  And it is a reality today.
[01:36:40.913 --> 01:36:42.213]  And here's the next thing it says.
[01:36:42.713 --> 01:36:52.735]  Controlled personnel effects investigates technologies to make selected adversaries think and act according to our needs
[01:36:53.215 --> 01:37:04.900]  Dominant remote control seeks to control, at a distance, an enemy's vehicles, sensors, communications, information systems, and manipulate them for military purposes.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.541]  It goes on to say, and I quote,
[01:37:07.159 --> 01:37:13.921]  By studying and modeling the human brain and nervous system, the ability to mentally influence or confuse personnel is also possible.
[01:37:14.321 --> 01:37:25.724]  Through sensory deception, it is possible to create synthetic images or holograms to confuse an individual's visual sense, or in a similar manner, confuse his sense of sound, taste, touch, or smell.
[01:37:26.104 --> 01:37:32.125]  In other words, complete hallucinations we wouldn't be able to figure out from reality from the fiction.
[01:37:32.506 --> 01:37:34.186]  That's where they're going with this technology.
[01:37:35.766 --> 01:37:37.587]  And they're openly discussing it.
[01:37:37.627 --> 01:37:39.628]  You know, I don't have the headline of the article in front of me.
[01:37:39.668 --> 01:37:41.528]  I want to say it was five years ago.
[01:37:41.869 --> 01:37:43.329]  I read it on air several times.
[01:37:43.349 --> 01:37:45.750]  It's somewhere in a box.
[01:37:46.250 --> 01:37:47.471]  I save all these stories.
[01:37:47.911 --> 01:37:49.832]  But I never been able to find it doing a search again.
[01:37:49.872 --> 01:38:01.557]  It was a Baltimore Sun article, and it said that just a couple lines that DARPA was studying using some type of broadcast towers to mind control the cities, but it said it was for our good to calm us.
[01:38:01.997 --> 01:38:07.622]  I mean, just open announcements of, oh, we're just nonchalant, we're just gonna mind control you.
[01:38:07.642 --> 01:38:11.044]  I mean, this is the government, folks, openly discussing this.
[01:38:11.104 --> 01:38:11.865]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:38:12.535 --> 01:38:17.058]  Well, one of the things that also came out was an article in Perimeters, a U.S.
[01:38:17.118 --> 01:38:18.379]  Army War College quarterly.
[01:38:18.419 --> 01:38:22.101]  The article was called, The Mind Has No Firewalls, which most people have seen by now.
[01:38:22.121 --> 01:38:23.082]  Yeah, I did see that, yeah.
[01:38:23.542 --> 01:38:26.224]  And, you know, that really gets into a lot of the background.
[01:38:26.244 --> 01:38:31.547]  But one of the really brilliant people in this area is a biophysicist, a friend of mine.
[01:38:31.907 --> 01:38:37.811]  He actually was the former director of the biophysics lab for the USSR Academy of Sciences for ten years.
[01:38:38.331 --> 01:38:43.213]  And Alex Kaverainen has done some incredible work in this area.
[01:38:43.273 --> 01:38:45.274]  He's now 60, a senior scientist.
[01:38:45.874 --> 01:38:47.755]  He's actually living in Finland now.
[01:38:48.436 --> 01:39:00.141]  In fact, the guy probably taught me more about the value of freedom than anyone I know, because after the fall, he settled for $200 a month in income in order to maintain his intellectual integrity and freedom.
[01:39:00.661 --> 01:39:01.122]  That's exactly right.
[01:39:01.142 --> 01:39:04.004]  I had him here for six weeks working with me in Alaska back in the late 90s.
[01:39:04.024 --> 01:39:06.967]  I was with him again at a closed conference that I put together with the Lay Institute in Dallas.
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:29.927]  Seven or eight guys, and these are the best guys I know in the field that I've known for at least 10 years, men and women of science that are recognized around the world.
[01:39:29.967 --> 01:39:42.476]  But the reason they got invited was they had demonstrated in their lives the ability to recover from huge personal losses and maintain their integrity throughout, which was the big criteria for getting invited to the meeting.
[01:39:42.976 --> 01:39:46.940]  But we had, in that meeting, we had Dr. Ben Eastland, the inventor of HAARP.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:54.587]  We had Alexander K. Varenin, the former guy that I just talked about running the USSR Academy of Science Biophysics Division.
[01:39:54.627 --> 01:39:57.189]  We had Rosalie Bertel, a Ph.D.
[01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:58.010]  in Mathematics.
[01:39:58.210 --> 01:39:59.491]  Brilliant woman.
[01:39:59.511 --> 01:40:01.433]  By the way, when is this?
[01:40:01.853 --> 01:40:04.836]  Man, I wish you videotaped this to make a video out of it.
[01:40:04.956 --> 01:40:05.476]  We did.
[01:40:05.557 --> 01:40:07.598]  We videoed all of the sessions.
[01:40:07.618 --> 01:40:09.280]  The minute it comes out, I want to carry it.
[01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:12.123]  Well, we'll make it available, actually, for free, Alex.
[01:40:12.163 --> 01:40:15.327]  It's something that we're going to give you links for that you can get out there.
[01:40:15.387 --> 01:40:15.487]  Good.
[01:40:15.507 --> 01:40:16.248]  We'll put it everywhere.
[01:40:16.568 --> 01:40:21.694]  And the audio from the first day, because we only... I guess that's the good part about having the lay fortune.
[01:40:21.734 --> 01:40:24.077]  Well, I'll tell you, that's a big win for Freedom, isn't it?
[01:40:24.637 --> 01:40:25.298]  It is indeed.
[01:40:25.358 --> 01:40:29.101]  In fact, Dorothy Lay is a wonderful human being.
[01:40:29.161 --> 01:40:33.104]  She's not involved so much in the family business at all.
[01:40:33.284 --> 01:40:38.468]  She did set up this non-profit to really start to get the public educated.
[01:40:38.488 --> 01:40:39.749]  This was our first conference.
[01:40:39.849 --> 01:40:48.455]  We also had Rosalie Bertel, who's one of the brightest in representing victims for radiological and other experiments.
[01:40:48.475 --> 01:40:51.457]  She testified with me in the European Parliament on these issues back in 1998.
[01:40:52.518 --> 01:40:53.379]  We're good to go.
[01:41:04.457 --> 01:41:11.282]  Elizabeth Rauscher, one of the best in biophysics, astrophysics, and geophysics, 273 peer-reviewed papers in her life.
[01:41:11.762 --> 01:41:24.950]  We had two electrophysiologists from Europe, good friends of mine, Reho Mikaela, my mentor in electrophysiology, his daughter, Anu Mikaela, and her husband, Levon Gasparian, both brilliant.
[01:41:25.931 --> 01:41:30.676]  Well, listen, I want to commend you for putting it on the web, but some people are also going to want a DVD.
[01:41:32.117 --> 01:41:38.163]  Man, I wish soon, I guess in a few years, the web will be as good as DVD, but people need that.
[01:41:38.223 --> 01:41:39.465]  They need that on DVD.
[01:41:39.765 --> 01:41:47.433]  I'll tell you, we produced it in a format where we're going to make it available, and because we're a non-profit, we'll make it available, at least on the internet, for free.
[01:41:48.393 --> 01:41:52.696]  We're going to try and figure out a way to make this the most available material out there.
[01:41:52.916 --> 01:41:56.779]  We consider it, when we post it, a public domain.
[01:41:56.839 --> 01:41:58.480]  So anyone is welcome to it.
[01:41:58.540 --> 01:42:02.483]  Alex will be happy to work with you on that because it is an important thing.
[01:42:02.583 --> 01:42:06.125]  It's an important thing to get the issues out.
[01:42:06.625 --> 01:42:13.270]  One of the other things that came up, and this is the most important part of all of this, is not just about mind control.
[01:42:13.979 --> 01:42:17.962]  But it's what they learned about human consciousness itself.
[01:42:18.462 --> 01:42:32.031]  This thing has anchored with me in the last few months because all of this crazy experimentation with drugs was to unleash human capacities that otherwise don't manifest very often.
[01:42:32.071 --> 01:42:33.972]  It's the wrong way to do it, I can tell you that.
[01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:41.528]  The reality is, what they learned about human consciousness, I think, scared the heck out of these guys.
[01:42:41.688 --> 01:42:49.457]  I think they found out that it's not as easy as they think, that once they start messing with it, it gives rise to the basic code of the species for survival.
[01:42:49.838 --> 01:42:51.720]  Now, I'm just guessing at this, what was discovered?
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:43:00.329]  Well, the whole sense of everyone is, is that we're about to see a huge leap in human evolution.
[01:43:00.369 --> 01:43:04.753]  I won't even say evolution, because the real word is, we already have these capabilities.
[01:43:04.794 --> 01:43:05.554]  Yeah, we have them.
[01:43:05.574 --> 01:43:06.055]  They're in us.
[01:43:06.575 --> 01:43:10.019]  They're the things, the gifts of the Spirit that Corinthians talks about.
[01:43:10.079 --> 01:43:10.880]  They're capabilities.
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.041]  Oh, you're talking about accessing them.
[01:43:12.281 --> 01:43:12.982]  Just accessing.
[01:43:13.062 --> 01:43:13.763]  Exactly.
[01:43:13.823 --> 01:43:14.624]  And here's the thing.
[01:43:15.291 --> 01:43:26.238]  If you take fear out of the equation, which is what we're all being whipped up into, and God makes clear about fear and the enemy of fear, it is the wrong thing because it shuts down the brain.
[01:43:26.278 --> 01:43:31.561]  If you look at the EEGs, the actual mapping of the brain in fear, you'll see why.
[01:43:31.942 --> 01:43:36.825]  Because you cannot trigger the anomalous capabilities of the human mind and human spirit.
[01:43:36.845 --> 01:43:42.028]  The lower brain takes over, the alligator-type brain at the bottom takes over, doesn't it?
[01:43:42.228 --> 01:43:50.260]  That's right, plus you get incoherent brain patterns that are not associated with any of the higher states of consciousness and intellectual and creative work.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.589]  We're created in the image of a creator, which means a whole lot more than what we look like, I can guarantee you.
[01:43:56.990 --> 01:43:58.472]  It's about the latent power
[01:43:58.832 --> 01:44:03.796]  The greater things that we're supposed to be doing at the end of this age, and we're at that point.
[01:44:04.077 --> 01:44:22.373]  And I think that's the fear that generated on the other side of this equation, because when the recognition of what each, every one of us is capable of as human beings, when rightly directed, rightly motivated, and with the right spirit behind us, nothing on the face of the earth can stop it.
[01:44:23.013 --> 01:44:25.636]  The move for fear as a standard
[01:44:26.397 --> 01:44:27.458]  Yeah, talk about that.
[01:44:27.518 --> 01:44:31.362]  We hit break and you didn't get into how justice is involved.
[01:44:43.133 --> 01:44:55.843]  Right, because what they did in the 80s, and we track this through our writing, and they brought up this whole protocol for joint development with a priority funding on those things they can use against foreign adversaries and use domestically here at home.
[01:44:56.223 --> 01:45:00.887]  And they said in the early sessions that they need to make sure it was all above board and all open to the public.
[01:45:01.187 --> 01:45:03.989]  And the first meeting they put together was classified.
[01:45:04.009 --> 01:45:05.691]  It was at Johns Hopkins University.
[01:45:06.131 --> 01:45:08.873]  And what they did is the only thing that came out was the agenda.
[01:45:09.234 --> 01:45:11.035]  And that agenda showed clearly
[01:45:11.896 --> 01:45:19.340]  Where they were headed, which was about control of the human being as the ultimate way to pacify communities.
[01:45:19.740 --> 01:45:27.864]  And we've seen a few new inventions come up in the last year that are going to allow this to even happen more effectively.
[01:45:27.944 --> 01:45:32.846]  And one of those technologies that people need to pay attention to is magnetic induction.
[01:45:33.266 --> 01:45:36.950]  Which is a transfer of energy through space for charging up.
[01:45:36.970 --> 01:45:39.452]  Are you going to use it first for charging up cell phones?
[01:45:39.572 --> 01:45:41.154]  That's what the big announcements were for.
[01:45:41.194 --> 01:45:42.175]  So you don't need batteries.
[01:45:42.575 --> 01:45:46.359]  Which means your GPS system, even with the battery out of your phone, still will work.
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:51.885]  And the ability to activate it as a bugging device under roving wiretaps will still work.
[01:45:52.425 --> 01:46:04.930]  And by modulating that electromagnetic frequency that will be put on every cell... Oh, it's going to have to be incredibly powerful transmission to be able to passively, at a distance, charge.
[01:46:05.030 --> 01:46:05.851]  Oh my God!
[01:46:06.071 --> 01:46:08.552]  Well, the thing is... What about frequency pollution?
[01:46:08.992 --> 01:46:16.416]  Absolutely, but they found out they can do it with just 2% loss, which is just as good as wire, hard wire transmission lines for power.
[01:46:16.836 --> 01:46:17.356]  Very effective.
[01:46:17.376 --> 01:46:22.219]  So we're not even talking about data over lines, we're talking about data in the air and power in the air.
[01:46:22.259 --> 01:46:24.760]  This is going to be, this doesn't sound too healthy.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:33.284]  No, and because you can modulate the signal to couple with any part of the human body, whether the liver, lungs, kidney, or the brain, and manipulate
[01:46:33.564 --> 01:46:35.725]  We're talking total body snatcher level!
[01:46:57.119 --> 01:47:08.969]  You know there was some work done by Persinger at Laurentian University in 1995 that he said if we could ever modulate the magnetic field lines of the planet we could manipulate behavior over the entire planet.
[01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:16.876]  That's the kind of stuff we're talking about but the thing about a magnetic system using cell towers for transmission
[01:47:17.376 --> 01:47:42.813]  a magnetic induction is you could regulate to specific areas within certain cell phone tower reach so you could only affect say everything off base you know if you get what I'm saying in other words you could target specific populations at specific times well we know I've got some internal data but he wouldn't come on air he's a top computer software engineer who works in overseas and he says that
[01:47:44.329 --> 01:47:45.810]  Oh, I'm having one of those mind bleeps.
[01:47:45.850 --> 01:47:47.251]  What's the big island?
[01:47:47.551 --> 01:47:48.032]  Singapore.
[01:47:48.692 --> 01:47:58.019]  The Singapore, he says there's massive chemical testing in the water, massive wavelength testing, and they're doing it in certain areas, and that Singapore is the global model.
[01:47:58.039 --> 01:47:59.220]  But he says it's already going on.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:06.605]  Yeah, and you know the things that are also coming, that just got announced, quantum computing, which we've been talking about for years, well that changes
[01:48:07.305 --> 01:48:18.015]  Everything in terms of what's possible in terms of the human mind because it will give People the ability to map brain activity in real time in three dimensions.
[01:48:18.055 --> 01:48:19.076]  You know, this is so important.
[01:48:19.116 --> 01:48:32.949]  I may just suspend calls I'm sorry everybody because I want to just get into mind control and maybe I'll tell you back about the environment things because so much what you're saying I've already Researched and I just say that to let people know this is this is documented but to think about that I mean take University of Texas
[01:48:33.349 --> 01:48:45.943]  I have a friend who works there, he gave me a tour a couple times of the psychology department, the unclassified areas, and it was all monkeys hooked in, just how to flash a TV screen at them to put them into a mesmerized brainwave level.
[01:48:47.052 --> 01:48:50.435]  Everything was DARPA or Justice Department or Defense Department funded.
[01:48:50.815 --> 01:48:53.217]  Everything was how to scan retinas at a distance and control.
[01:48:53.598 --> 01:48:55.459]  It's like it's all how to control us.
[01:48:55.699 --> 01:49:00.003]  This is what I was allowed to see and the general public doesn't even know this stuff exists.
[01:49:00.463 --> 01:49:01.064]  What do we do?
[01:49:01.084 --> 01:49:03.366]  They're just going to put the towers up, doctor, and then it's...
[01:49:04.287 --> 01:49:04.987]  Oh my God!
[01:49:05.007 --> 01:49:11.590]  It's also about capping, keeping us from releasing what otherwise might be the only challenge left.
[01:49:11.670 --> 01:49:12.290]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:14.871]  Keeping us at a lower brainwave level.
[01:49:14.931 --> 01:49:15.492]  Keeping him.
[01:49:16.172 --> 01:49:18.413]  Just what the sodium and stannous fluoride is meant for.
[01:49:18.433 --> 01:49:18.893]  That's right.
[01:49:18.913 --> 01:49:20.294]  Just what the mercury is meant for.
[01:49:20.454 --> 01:49:20.734]  That's right.
[01:49:20.754 --> 01:49:21.914]  Everything is to suppress.
[01:49:22.575 --> 01:49:23.295]  Exactly right.
[01:49:23.395 --> 01:49:25.736]  And you know, when you look at the quantum computing models,
[01:49:26.517 --> 01:49:31.361]  The possibilities for these guys is the most sinister in the history of humankind.
[01:49:31.421 --> 01:49:36.104]  Let's talk about quantum computing models and what that means on the other side.
[01:49:36.164 --> 01:49:37.425]  I'm sorry folks, it's too important.
[01:49:37.445 --> 01:49:38.146]  We're not going to take calls.
[01:49:38.166 --> 01:49:39.126]  I know you've been holding.
[01:49:39.146 --> 01:49:39.747]  I apologize.
[01:49:39.827 --> 01:49:40.728]  It's just we have to do it.
[01:49:41.008 --> 01:49:46.912]  We've only got another half hour or the next hour and I want to just continue on the mind control because it's everywhere.
[01:49:47.192 --> 01:49:48.193]  There's different types of it.
[01:49:48.213 --> 01:49:51.976]  We're talking about sophisticated electronic warfare right now.
[01:49:57.182 --> 01:50:02.651]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:03.031 --> 01:50:10.623]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:18.434]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.814 --> 01:50:30.259]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.559 --> 01:50:34.481]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.521 --> 01:50:36.482]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.782 --> 01:50:40.624]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.133 --> 01:50:59.356]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.496 --> 01:51:07.579]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:14.883]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:15.083 --> 01:51:16.344]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:16.444 --> 01:51:22.329]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.529 --> 01:51:27.613]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.733 --> 01:51:36.601]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.881 --> 01:51:40.163]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:42.325 --> 01:51:42.726]  I think?
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.602]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.822 --> 01:51:59.526]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.846 --> 01:52:08.795]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.935 --> 01:52:13.860]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:14.060 --> 01:52:15.862]  Every time you walk away from your computer,
[01:52:16.082 --> 01:52:16.663]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.822 --> 01:52:35.923]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.
[01:52:36.264 --> 01:52:41.346]  Right now, you can order your NET7 security switch from NET7 Technologies for only $39.95.

[01:53:01.312 --> 01:53:07.053]  Every day, there are multiple articles, I don't even get to, from PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:53:07.673 --> 01:53:11.294]  Smart cameras to tackle abandoned luggage alarms.
[01:53:11.934 --> 01:53:12.815]  All over the U.S.
[01:53:12.835 --> 01:53:18.276]  they're going to put RFID on all the school tests to make sure you're not, quote, cheating where you take them.
[01:53:19.136 --> 01:53:24.217]  Now, the Pentagon and others have said, Walmart forcing adoption as a government front, that
[01:53:25.689 --> 01:53:35.552]  Literally like Google or Yahoo or another big search engine is able to show you all the cyberspace and map that dimension, you know, via these networks.
[01:53:36.412 --> 01:53:54.817]  They're talking about mapping every piece of, you know, in this dimension, every book, every Campbell's soup can, every razor, every car, every part in the car with an RFID that they can then map and track everything in the true three-dimensional world.
[01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:57.010]  And they're doing this.
[01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:58.370]  I mean, I'm seeing it every day.
[01:53:58.410 --> 01:53:59.531]  It's going into everything.
[01:54:00.652 --> 01:54:05.594]  The answer is, politically, seize control of the shadow government before it takes full control of us.
[01:54:06.215 --> 01:54:07.295]  It's about survival.
[01:54:07.595 --> 01:54:15.900]  These are power-mad, arrogant, very dark people who are about selfishness, about feudalism, about controlling the mass, so they can have their monopoly of control.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:18.822]  They're threatened by free human expression, the human spirit.
[01:54:19.142 --> 01:54:20.202]  They must dominate it.
[01:54:20.242 --> 01:54:21.063]  They must poison it.
[01:54:21.718 --> 01:54:22.598]  This is feudalism.
[01:54:22.638 --> 01:54:23.519]  Study feudalism.
[01:54:23.579 --> 01:54:24.359]  Study the serfs.
[01:54:24.819 --> 01:54:25.919]  What the serfs have lived under.
[01:54:25.959 --> 01:54:28.620]  This is a developed system with a high-tech overlay.
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:29.721]  It is so evil.
[01:54:30.241 --> 01:54:32.321]  And the new book is Controlling the Human Mind.
[01:54:32.461 --> 01:54:34.262]  The video is Mind Control.
[01:54:34.282 --> 01:54:36.803]  A Brave New World or Enhancing Human Performance.
[01:54:37.203 --> 01:54:41.124]  Both available right now at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:41.144 --> 01:54:41.824]  Please don't wait.
[01:54:42.184 --> 01:54:42.725]  Get these.
[01:54:42.745 --> 01:54:43.985]  Show them to groups.
[01:54:44.005 --> 01:54:46.446]  Show them to other people.
[01:54:50.894 --> 01:54:52.495]  You know, show it to your church.
[01:54:53.556 --> 01:54:55.498]  We have to become aware of this.
[01:54:55.578 --> 01:54:57.580]  And the media has been very good at making fun of this.
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:58.280]  It doesn't exist.
[01:54:59.221 --> 01:55:06.387]  But then, what, just three or four months ago, the head of the Air Force said, hey, we need to use these microwave guns in the U.S.
[01:55:06.407 --> 01:55:07.428]  on the citizens first.
[01:55:07.789 --> 01:55:10.731]  That way we can get around international laws against using it on enemies.
[01:55:11.132 --> 01:55:13.814]  I mean, they can't use this on foreign troops under international treaty.
[01:55:14.154 --> 01:55:18.398]  So, oh, let's use it on our people to then get around that and claim it's a civilian use.
[01:55:19.329 --> 01:55:22.531]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're already testing stuff.
[01:55:22.571 --> 01:55:23.351]  Everybody knows it.
[01:55:23.371 --> 01:55:25.752]  They're already playing all sorts of games with the skies.
[01:55:25.772 --> 01:55:36.558]  They're already... Dr. Baggish, before we get more into the actual nuts and bolts of this, the mindset of the elite, your decades of studying them, ferreting and digging all this out.
[01:55:37.138 --> 01:55:45.442]  I mean, I've studied them too, and I think I understand their mindset, but it also seems like there's a wanton self-destructiveness that we see with psychopaths and others, because
[01:55:46.249 --> 01:55:56.077]  You know, they know GMO crops with the new amino acids and ring structures are totally toxic to the body and are killing the rats and guinea pigs that are fed it, but they still approve it.
[01:55:56.377 --> 01:56:09.168]  They know that just one variety of Monsanto Bt corn has a live pesticide in it and is hurting everybody and any animals and bees that eat it.
[01:56:09.188 --> 01:56:12.951]  I mean, they know that frequency pollution is hurting us.
[01:56:13.431 --> 01:56:13.991]  They know.
[01:56:14.092 --> 01:56:18.914]  I mean it's almost, and I don't believe in space aliens and all that, but you talk about the devil.
[01:56:18.954 --> 01:56:23.157]  It's like there is a dark force that just wants to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:56:23.337 --> 01:56:27.580]  That wants to vandalize the Earth, screw everything up, problem, reaction, solution.
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:29.501]  The people then wake up to the threat to Earth.
[01:56:29.741 --> 01:56:34.424]  They create a false, you know, let's fix man-made global warming, which it isn't, with a global tax.
[01:56:34.864 --> 01:56:40.452]  Which doesn't help, even if man-made global warming was real, to then fund a huge apparatchik to enslave us further.
[01:56:40.632 --> 01:56:44.778]  I mean, you're speaking to the mindset, the spirit, the essence of these people.
[01:56:45.218 --> 01:56:46.160]  What is their deal?
[01:56:46.781 --> 01:56:50.304]  You know, I think you're absolutely right on target.
[01:56:50.804 --> 01:57:02.013]  In all my experience and almost 50 years of experience meeting a lot of people in high places, they all have a deep philosophical underpinning.
[01:57:02.594 --> 01:57:07.778]  Once you get that, then you see where they come from, and there is a lot of blatantly
[01:57:07.918 --> 01:57:08.699]  Stay there.
[01:57:08.719 --> 01:57:09.179]  Stay there.
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:10.440]  That's science.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:12.042]  Rare reaction or is it equal?
[01:57:12.082 --> 01:57:12.803]  Stay there.
[01:57:12.823 --> 01:57:14.104]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[01:57:33.863 --> 01:57:38.705]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.745 --> 01:57:39.206]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.366 --> 01:57:40.146]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.346 --> 01:57:41.326]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:43.027 --> 01:57:48.470]  You want answers?
[01:57:48.610 --> 01:57:50.151]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.024 --> 01:58:01.687]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.208 --> 01:58:06.331]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.854 --> 01:58:20.183]  Not only chronicling the threats to humanity and the species, but trying to let you understand and show you examples of how much power you do have and how we can resist these tyrants.
[01:58:20.783 --> 01:58:22.044]  This is such an important topic.
[01:58:22.064 --> 01:58:23.064]  I've suspended calls.
[01:58:23.104 --> 01:58:24.805]  We will have a whole show or two next week.
[01:58:24.825 --> 01:58:25.826]  They're nothing but calls.
[01:58:26.226 --> 01:58:31.929]  I've already told my producer about this, and my professor, thinking of Dr. Nick Begich, who's also been a professor.
[01:58:33.009 --> 01:58:40.053]  Dr. Begich, looking at this, please continue with the solutions.
[01:58:42.034 --> 01:58:43.655]  But going back, that's what I've found.
[01:58:44.335 --> 01:58:45.656]  I mean, people really are
[01:58:46.573 --> 01:58:49.033]  When you get to the higher levels, none of them are atheists.
[01:58:49.474 --> 01:59:09.497]  They'll put that out on the surface, but really powerful people are either driven by good, and that's generally the minority, or they're driven by darkness, and they literally thrive off of pain and suffering and the exertion of power, or as O'Brien says in 1984, pressing on the nerve of power for power's sake, ripping apart humanity.
[01:59:10.737 --> 01:59:13.898]  What is this expression, and your study being around these people,
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:17.361]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[01:59:17.621 --> 01:59:18.742]  What's happening here?
[01:59:18.922 --> 01:59:20.122]  You know, it's really simple.
[01:59:20.202 --> 01:59:21.242]  I mean, it's so simple.
[01:59:21.322 --> 01:59:29.565]  It's either people are motivated by their own flesh, I mean, really, in terms of what they do in these combinations that are done in secret.
[01:59:29.605 --> 01:59:30.886]  I mean, you see people that are
[01:59:31.946 --> 01:59:38.169]  You know, they're the whoremongers of the world, or you see those that are motivated by spirit.
[01:59:38.229 --> 01:59:45.833]  And there's a very big difference in these characters in terms of how they manifest with their works in the world, and you see it.
[01:59:46.393 --> 01:59:51.735]  And, you know, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to analyze what someone is doing by their actions.
[01:59:51.795 --> 01:59:52.776]  Forget what they say.
[01:59:52.816 --> 02:00:00.139]  Let's look at what they've done and what they do, and you see the destructive nature of it and the lack of constructive... The fruits!
[02:00:00.619 --> 02:00:01.460]  That's right!
[02:00:21.015 --> 02:00:22.655]  Yeah, you've been trying to get into quantum modeling.
[02:00:22.695 --> 02:00:23.296]  Go ahead.
[02:00:23.576 --> 02:00:26.256]  Everyone is a quantum computer, whether you realize it or not.
[02:00:26.316 --> 02:00:29.337]  Now, let me tell you what a quantum computer can do in the real world.
[02:00:29.817 --> 02:00:44.741]  The latest supercomputers, not quantum computers, they can take 6.6 billion people with a hand calculator, every five seconds, doing a calculation for 60 hours, will do what our average supercomputers today will do in a second.
[02:00:45.639 --> 02:00:46.780]  Think about this.
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:53.887]  6.6 billion people every five seconds doing a calculation for 60 hours does what a supercomputer does in a second.
[02:00:54.328 --> 02:01:00.354]  Now a quantum computer does what all those people do for a trillion years
[02:01:01.343 --> 02:01:02.024]  In one hour.
[02:01:02.604 --> 02:01:03.925]  And we have exponential growth.
[02:01:03.945 --> 02:01:06.347]  You know, they've been saying for 10 years, it's every two and a half years.
[02:01:06.808 --> 02:01:12.412]  Isn't computing and storage data, it's well surpassed the two and a half year deadline?
[02:01:12.432 --> 02:01:12.593]  Oh yes.
[02:01:12.873 --> 02:01:13.193]  Oh yeah.
[02:01:13.273 --> 02:01:23.662]  And when you get quantum computing, and they just announced the very first ones of these for commercial application will be available by 2010, which tells me they're probably at some level already available.
[02:01:23.702 --> 02:01:24.563]  But the fact is,
[02:01:25.223 --> 02:01:33.651]  This will kill every encryption system in the world, instantly can be read, all data links can be sorted.
[02:01:33.951 --> 02:01:38.876]  It'll almost have a form of intelligence that surpasses what we think of as miraculous.
[02:01:38.896 --> 02:01:40.137]  And what are the elites doing?
[02:01:40.177 --> 02:01:40.718]  This is key.
[02:01:41.258 --> 02:01:51.531]  The elites are networking everything, going to pure drone aircraft, and that's another danger when they have these drone aircraft and drone troops and the rest of it.
[02:01:51.771 --> 02:01:56.457]  Then a tiny elite can wage war and do 9-11 style stuff without anybody stopping them.
[02:01:56.858 --> 02:01:58.660]  This is just hell on earth we're talking about.
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:17.572]  It is, and then when you look at the hacking of the human mind with quantum computing, what you'll be able to do is look at what the brain is doing as a person originates a thought, or a feeling, or an emotion, in three dimensions be able to take that and then create a complex signal that will impose it on others.
[02:02:18.153 --> 02:02:19.734]  This is the direction of the science.
[02:02:19.794 --> 02:02:21.355]  And you'll think it's even your own thought!
[02:02:21.615 --> 02:02:23.176]  I mean, these computers
[02:02:24.111 --> 02:02:31.933]  A computer to be assigned to each person or even the millions are so powerful and literally be calculating while your brain works and be relaying the information.
[02:02:32.013 --> 02:02:33.413]  It's just total mind control.
[02:02:34.034 --> 02:02:38.295]  Dr. Nick Beggars, let's talk about the implications of this and how to stop it when we get back.
[02:02:38.355 --> 02:02:39.295]  This is the real world 2007.
[02:02:40.735 --> 02:02:41.976]  Yes, we are in the future.
[02:02:42.016 --> 02:02:43.356]  We're living it now.
[02:02:48.758 --> 02:02:54.223]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.583 --> 02:03:02.210]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.927 --> 02:03:09.972]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.373 --> 02:03:21.801]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.101 --> 02:03:25.564]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:26.084 --> 02:03:27.986]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.346 --> 02:03:32.189]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:45.813 --> 02:03:49.377]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:03:49.417 --> 02:03:49.917]  are located?
[02:03:50.138 --> 02:03:53.521]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:03:53.741 --> 02:03:58.446]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:03:58.726 --> 02:04:03.731]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:04:04.031 --> 02:04:04.352]  I think so.
[02:04:22.651 --> 02:04:23.151]  I think so.
[02:04:45.197 --> 02:04:46.758]  Did you know you have been cheated?
[02:04:46.918 --> 02:04:49.300]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:50.200]  You heard that right.
[02:04:50.300 --> 02:04:52.602]  You owe no debt on your bank-issued credit cards.
[02:04:52.782 --> 02:04:54.043]  You don't have to pay them off.
[02:04:54.203 --> 02:04:55.724]  The banks are defrauding you.
[02:04:55.884 --> 02:04:57.345]  Now is the time to fight back.
[02:04:57.505 --> 02:05:00.147]  You can completely wipe out your credit card debt fast.
[02:05:00.287 --> 02:05:03.669]  The procedure is easy and everything is done legally and within the law.
[02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:05.951]  We have better than a 90% success rate.
[02:05:06.031 --> 02:05:09.153]  Check out 1-2-3nodebt.com.
[02:05:09.353 --> 02:05:11.655]  The process is simple and is non-judicial.
[02:05:11.815 --> 02:05:14.957]  It's an easy letter-writing process that can be done by anyone with a
[02:05:15.077 --> 02:05:15.497]  We're good to go.
[02:05:45.572 --> 02:05:50.596]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.976 --> 02:05:53.257]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:53.598 --> 02:06:12.411]  He's got another interview coming up in about 20 minutes, uh, in, uh, there in Alaska with some corruption in the oil companies.
[02:06:12.771 --> 02:06:15.053]  I'm gonna get him to spend a few minutes on that before he leaves us.
[02:06:16.823 --> 02:06:23.711]  Dr. Nick Begich, we've got a huge Oklahoma City news coming up as well with Jesse Trinidad, the lawyer who blew that wide open because they killed his brother and he discovered it.
[02:06:23.731 --> 02:06:26.574]  A lot of times that's what gets you involved in this stuff, folks.
[02:06:27.776 --> 02:06:34.183]  Let's continue with solutions and ways to fight this, and if technology is accelerating so fast,
[02:06:34.904 --> 02:06:37.145]  I don't even think these elites can keep control of it.
[02:06:38.345 --> 02:06:43.926]  I'll say this, it's going to be a very interesting time ahead of us, isn't it?
[02:06:44.086 --> 02:06:47.207]  I absolutely believe that, because they won't maintain control of it.
[02:06:47.267 --> 02:06:49.388]  It'll slip away from them.
[02:06:49.588 --> 02:06:58.870]  We're going to wait and see, but there's a lot of concern about who ends up pulling the strings behind the scenes, because it's not just governments.
[02:06:59.497 --> 02:07:04.543]  Powerful corporations have just as much access to this technology as anyone else.
[02:07:04.603 --> 02:07:07.206]  Maybe more, because they're the ones developing it in the first place.
[02:07:07.226 --> 02:07:08.908]  It's not happening in government labs.
[02:07:09.128 --> 02:07:11.011]  This is how mass mind control works.
[02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:18.867]  They can put these systems up, start using them, and then the elites will even think they're in control, and it'll be somebody completely else running it.
[02:07:19.168 --> 02:07:21.069]  That's the problem with this mind control.
[02:07:21.449 --> 02:07:21.669]  Right.
[02:07:21.749 --> 02:07:27.972]  In fact, when we went to the European Parliament on this issue back in 1998, we actually got a resolution passed that dealt with it.
[02:07:28.452 --> 02:07:37.436]  We explained to parliamentarians in a closed part of that meeting that the real risk is to them, because elites are the ones who are targeted first.
[02:07:37.476 --> 02:07:40.758]  If you can co-opt the leadership, the rest of the country usually folds.
[02:07:41.278 --> 02:08:05.087]  So, when you think about it, you know, because people are under this illusion of following their leadership and not challenging them when they're out of line, and here's what the European Parliament passed in their resolution, A. Ford, 0005 forward slash 99, and I quote, it calls for an international convention introducing a global ban on all developments and deployments of weapons which might enable any form of manipulation of human beings, because even
[02:08:06.294 --> 02:08:07.035]  And that's the quote.
[02:08:07.055 --> 02:08:18.342]  But even thinking about this, even some of the elites who recognize this threat to themselves understand clearly why it needs to change.
[02:08:18.402 --> 02:08:23.185]  And there are a few good people still stuck in good places, but the problem is they are in the minority.
[02:08:23.805 --> 02:08:26.687]  We need to raise up good leadership, and it may be too late for that.
[02:08:26.747 --> 02:08:28.148]  I mean, we all know that.
[02:08:28.328 --> 02:08:29.989]  Here's a whole other area along the same lines.
[02:08:30.009 --> 02:08:35.312]  Remember two years ago, that Air Force colonel accidentally had a classified braving, the San Francisco Chronicle?
[02:08:35.752 --> 02:08:38.374]  Picked it up about antimatter bombs they've already built.
[02:08:38.795 --> 02:08:39.015]  Right.
[02:08:39.155 --> 02:08:42.938]  And then the top scientists are saying, don't test it, it could blow up the whole solar system.
[02:08:43.339 --> 02:08:47.822]  And they don't care, they still just built it, even though they have no idea what it potentially could do.
[02:08:47.883 --> 02:08:49.264]  I mean, there's just no end to this.
[02:08:49.644 --> 02:08:52.747]  No, and that's why these things have been done in darkness.
[02:08:52.827 --> 02:09:01.054]  I mean, I say keep the technology, you know, the aspect of how to build it secret if you need to, but we ought to be conceptually talking about things so that the risks
[02:09:01.474 --> 02:09:01.654]  I agree.
[02:09:21.639 --> 02:09:21.959]  Yes, we are.
[02:09:44.056 --> 02:09:46.338]  The Virginia Shooter, any areas Dr. Begich?
[02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:47.639]  Yeah, you know, there's a couple things.
[02:09:47.719 --> 02:09:54.883]  First of all, I want to encourage people to support us by getting the book and video and then when they're done with it, send it to their U.S.
[02:09:54.923 --> 02:09:56.024]  Senator or U.S.
[02:09:56.084 --> 02:09:56.704]  Congressman.
[02:09:57.305 --> 02:10:01.687]  You know, some of them are going to be shocked when they read this material and it's very difficult to refute.
[02:10:02.488 --> 02:10:03.248]  But get it to them.
[02:10:03.268 --> 02:10:07.631]  You know, when they get four or five copies of something showing up on a desk, somebody ends up looking at it.
[02:10:07.711 --> 02:10:10.653]  And if they look at our material, because it's so well documented,
[02:10:11.153 --> 02:10:11.454]  I think so.
[02:10:28.857 --> 02:10:38.242]  Where we're pacified as a population, we need freedom of the mind as a fundamental aspect of who we are as human beings preserved, and we need to at least make the effort.
[02:10:38.262 --> 02:10:43.144]  So on the solution side, get the material when you're done with it and get it to your U.S.
[02:10:43.164 --> 02:10:48.927]  Senator, become a committee of one, send it in, and let's see if we can raise their awareness.
[02:10:48.967 --> 02:10:50.508]  We did a little bit in Europe.
[02:10:50.908 --> 02:10:52.569]  We know it can be done in the U.S.
[02:10:52.909 --> 02:10:58.132]  There are still enough people left in the dark who are in government service because the bureaucracy is under it.
[02:10:58.172 --> 02:11:01.354]  That shadow government Alex is talking about is real.
[02:11:01.735 --> 02:11:08.719]  And it is the bureaucracy that just waits for the next accepting administration to go along with whatever their agenda is.
[02:11:09.139 --> 02:11:31.446]  But those agendas move forward year to year, administration to administration, without oversight, without controls, and now billions and billions and billions and to date trillions of dollars of our money have been spent not to free us as a democratic republic, but to enslave us as the most slave class population ever existing on the planet.
[02:11:31.746 --> 02:11:34.987]  We need to stop it, and we need to stop it by becoming educated,
[02:11:35.547 --> 02:11:42.990]  Not just emotionally charged, but educated with the facts that will carry the debate so we can end this direction.
[02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:44.810]  And if we're successful, great!
[02:11:45.271 --> 02:11:50.372]  The challenge is huge, because today we've seen new concepts introduced in warfare.
[02:11:50.452 --> 02:11:52.013]  One of them is preemptive warfare.
[02:11:52.533 --> 02:11:55.194]  Any government can develop these technologies today.
[02:11:55.694 --> 02:12:00.636]  Any independent contractor could develop these technologies today, and many already have.
[02:12:01.116 --> 02:12:07.104]  Who's going to launch the first preemptive war against America or against humanity itself?
[02:12:08.087 --> 02:12:20.416]  And it's an evil force loose on this planet today, and this needs to end, but it'll only end with the good conscious people of this planet starting to ask the very tough questions.
[02:12:20.736 --> 02:12:29.483]  We need a national and an international whistleblower mechanism where we can blow the whistle on corporations and governments that violate these various principles.
[02:12:29.563 --> 02:12:31.284]  We need something that will work.
[02:12:31.804 --> 02:12:48.070]  Whether it's tied to our religious institutions, whether it's tied to ombudsmen that function, we need something that can restore some level of confidence and start to strip away the layers of secrecy that are working against free peoples across this planet right now.
[02:12:48.190 --> 02:12:51.431]  And Dr. Baggage, two points I'd like you to comment on.
[02:12:53.271 --> 02:12:55.132]  More than anything, not just education,
[02:12:57.254 --> 02:13:14.779]  But saying, wait a minute, we've developed too quickly as a species, not suppressing technology, but until it's been tested, vetted, and until it's completely transparent, everything must be transparency, and instead we have everything going the opposite, into total secrecy, then it must be dismantled.
[02:13:15.339 --> 02:13:22.181]  And I think educating people about frequency pollution, which is now the data showing really is causing cancers and mental problems and
[02:13:22.717 --> 02:13:24.198]  Affecting these bee populations.
[02:13:24.619 --> 02:13:25.179]  Exactly.
[02:13:25.679 --> 02:13:30.063]  Until we can do that, we need to slow down.
[02:13:30.883 --> 02:13:31.464]  Absolutely.
[02:13:32.705 --> 02:13:33.525]  Here's the problem.
[02:13:33.545 --> 02:13:44.834]  The elite's main drive, they claim, is to cull our population instead of using these technologies to support us, and instead of using education to slow the growth and then stop it.
[02:13:46.135 --> 02:13:50.279]  Which, you know, clearly, until we can export populations for colonization, it needs to be slowed down.
[02:13:50.799 --> 02:13:54.843]  But once you put those powers in these people's hands, it's going to be used for naught.
[02:13:55.263 --> 02:14:01.929]  They want to use the mass mind control so they can carry out the population reductions and really horrible forms of tyranny.
[02:14:02.309 --> 02:14:05.532]  And this elite has shown themselves to not be fit to clean toilets.
[02:14:05.552 --> 02:14:08.555]  So can you comment on the two points I just made?
[02:14:08.935 --> 02:14:09.516]  Absolutely.
[02:14:09.536 --> 02:14:10.876]  You're dead on right.
[02:14:10.956 --> 02:14:13.338]  I mean it is about ultimately control.
[02:14:13.498 --> 02:14:17.040]  It's about restricting our higher capacities as human beings.
[02:14:17.080 --> 02:14:18.962]  The things that all of us just take for granted.
[02:14:19.022 --> 02:14:20.663]  Our creative efforts, our intellects.
[02:14:21.503 --> 02:14:26.687]  But more than that, in terms of affecting populations, I don't agree with the elites.
[02:14:26.767 --> 02:14:29.589]  I think the planet can support as many people as are born here.
[02:14:29.689 --> 02:14:31.370]  It's a matter of right application
[02:14:31.890 --> 02:14:32.150]  I think?
[02:14:51.256 --> 02:14:52.317]  Where is it all going?
[02:14:52.397 --> 02:14:58.502]  It's going to the greedy, selfish, self-centered, flesh interests of those in charge.
[02:14:58.642 --> 02:15:00.643]  And there's too many of them in charge right now.
[02:15:01.104 --> 02:15:09.730]  You know, when you look at the solution side, ultimately we need to look inside of each of ourselves and start making some of the tougher decisions about who we are.
[02:15:10.071 --> 02:15:12.012]  Not with anxiety, but with confidence.
[02:15:12.112 --> 02:15:14.274]  Recognize our callings, whatever they might be.
[02:15:14.334 --> 02:15:19.558]  Begin to pursue them with vigor and the higher attributes will manifest.
[02:15:19.898 --> 02:15:37.201]  You know, when we're engaged in fear and worry because the economics and social situations and all the stuff thrown at us by the elites from every quarter, we need to start taking stock of who we are as individuals, following our callings, and we will overcome the things that we face in this world.
[02:15:37.521 --> 02:15:43.327]  The things that are working against us right now is this sense of defeat and apathy.
[02:15:43.408 --> 02:15:45.850]  And you know, people say, well, nobody votes, no one gets involved.
[02:15:45.870 --> 02:15:46.211]  You know what?
[02:15:46.291 --> 02:15:52.097]  I say great, because it's a lot easier to convince 6 or 7% of the people you're right than 51%.
[02:15:52.858 --> 02:15:58.144]  The one thing we could be doing everywhere across this country if we want to at least keep the oars in the water,
[02:15:58.764 --> 02:16:11.811]  We should be pushing everywhere we can have initiatives and referendums that we go back to paper ballots, because this is the most corrupted system of all, and where we have that ability to create initiatives, some things should never be automated.
[02:16:12.151 --> 02:16:20.215]  Those things that are the root of democracies and democratic republics as we know them today have to be preserved, which means paper ballots,
[02:16:20.595 --> 02:16:23.096]  With a real audit trail that can be hand-counted.
[02:16:23.376 --> 02:16:25.697]  And who cares if it takes a week to find out who won?
[02:16:26.137 --> 02:16:28.018]  If it's confidence in who won.
[02:16:28.398 --> 02:16:34.241]  The other thing to watch, and the New World Order is going to try and do it here like they did in Australia, is mandatory voting.
[02:16:34.261 --> 02:16:39.503]  Where you have to vote as a requirement to get driver's licenses, access to Social Security, all this stuff.
[02:16:39.523 --> 02:16:41.264]  And if you don't vote, you lose privileges.
[02:16:41.744 --> 02:16:49.888]  And why they want that is because most people who don't care aren't informed and are going to respond to whatever 30-second soundbite they heard on the 6 o'clock news.
[02:16:50.388 --> 02:16:51.609]  And we don't need that kind of voter.
[02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:58.291]  That's going to force the mob, who was never involved, to be involved, and they'll just go with the Coca-Cola style PR campaign.
[02:16:58.651 --> 02:16:59.332]  Exactly right.
[02:16:59.352 --> 02:17:03.493]  And who's going to be able to challenge that and raise the money to run campaigns and challenge that?
[02:17:03.633 --> 02:17:04.133]  Nobody.
[02:17:04.454 --> 02:17:09.776]  And that's why you see what's happened in Australia as an archetype for what can happen here.
[02:17:09.816 --> 02:17:18.179]  The confiscation of guns, the reduction in civil liberties, and then the teeth of it is you either vote, which means you buy our propaganda,
[02:17:18.679 --> 02:17:21.601]  And accept our propaganda or you go without.
[02:17:21.821 --> 02:17:24.422]  And that is not the way of free people.
[02:17:24.882 --> 02:17:25.243]  I agree.
[02:17:25.263 --> 02:17:27.584]  I want to come back to you to talk about the environment a little bit.
[02:17:28.164 --> 02:17:34.888]  And then briefly get into the scandal brewing up there with the oil and gas that supplies much of this country's energy needs.
[02:17:35.448 --> 02:17:36.809]  Dr. Nick Baggage is our guest.
[02:17:36.829 --> 02:17:39.310]  The book is Controlling the Human Mind.
[02:17:39.350 --> 02:17:40.771]  The video is Mind Control.

[02:19:47.549 --> 02:19:48.590]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:51.691]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:19:51.971 --> 02:19:56.114]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:19:56.554 --> 02:19:57.394]  So what do you do?
[02:19:57.694 --> 02:20:02.257]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:20:02.757 --> 02:20:04.879]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:21:49.366 --> 02:21:51.027]  Final segment with Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:21:51.748 --> 02:21:56.752]  You know, he was talking about people that are property or flesh based.
[02:21:56.812 --> 02:21:59.614]  It's not saying you don't want a nice house, or a nice car, or a shelter.
[02:22:00.255 --> 02:22:09.902]  But when you worship it, I mean, I watch politicians, I watch video of global summits, they actually enjoy people worshiping them, and people complimenting them, and they get off on it.
[02:22:09.922 --> 02:22:14.766]  You see them literally putting their teeth together and going, mmm, they're like feeding on it.
[02:22:15.766 --> 02:22:18.047]  And frankly, to me, that's annoying and embarrassing.
[02:22:18.408 --> 02:22:22.590]  I want to just be left alone and go swimming and go out in the woods or spend time with family.
[02:22:22.870 --> 02:22:25.412]  You've got to understand, folks, normal people are like that.
[02:22:25.432 --> 02:22:33.497]  The globalists, these elites, are really an aberrant subspecies that you find in all of these subraces, you know, black, white, it doesn't matter.
[02:22:34.557 --> 02:22:36.339]  Or, you know, all the varieties and derivations.
[02:22:36.999 --> 02:22:44.346]  And it's almost like a malfunctioning humans in more complex societies get in control because they're willing to violate their basic human programming.
[02:22:44.586 --> 02:22:45.947]  Dr. Begich, do you agree with that statement?
[02:22:46.467 --> 02:22:47.168]  I do indeed.
[02:22:47.228 --> 02:22:57.197]  In fact, the elites prefer people to be basically a little dull intellectually and more involved in what satisfies them personally.
[02:22:57.237 --> 02:23:02.261]  I mean, the corruption cases that are going on right here in Alaska, I mean, when people found out how cheap
[02:23:02.839 --> 02:23:07.903]  These politicians sold their votes for, for billions of dollars in tax consequences.
[02:23:07.923 --> 02:23:12.487]  They sold them, you know, for prices that you could have put it in the Sears catalog.
[02:23:12.527 --> 02:23:14.088]  Forget the Neiman Marcus catalog.
[02:23:14.108 --> 02:23:17.031]  You could have put these guys up for sale like a piece of collateral.
[02:23:17.471 --> 02:23:23.496]  I mean, the joke around town has been, hey, if they knew they were so cheap, good people could have bought them for maybe some good outcomes.
[02:23:23.877 --> 02:23:28.040]  The sad story is... Give us a quick briefing August, because you're about to have to go on another show.
[02:23:28.200 --> 02:23:28.740]  That's right.
[02:23:29.060 --> 02:23:36.542]  The thing that has happened here is the oil and gas industry has been caught pushing and bribing, and they've actually confessed.
[02:23:36.802 --> 02:23:43.204]  VECO executives just confessed and pled guilty to bribery and conspiracy.
[02:23:43.284 --> 02:23:47.705]  They pled guilty eight months ago and have been tape recording everyone's conversations.
[02:23:48.145 --> 02:23:55.127]  They just brought down three other legislators in Alaska, two ex-legislators, one of the guys I ran against two years ago, Speaker of the House,
[02:23:55.547 --> 02:23:56.547]  We're good to go.
[02:24:16.674 --> 02:24:17.134]  We're good to go.
[02:24:36.679 --> 02:24:40.984]  Gold, oil, gems, coal, more than Saudi Arabia.
[02:24:51.756 --> 02:24:58.604]  Uh, you know, one politician, uh, relayed to me that they had heard from one of these guys that it was the best legislature money could buy.
[02:24:58.784 --> 02:25:04.230]  And in commenting to a labor union, the guy said, if you had a million dollars, you could own one too.
[02:25:04.810 --> 02:25:06.873]  And this is the problem, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:07.213 --> 02:25:08.053]  Talk about the numbers.
[02:25:08.113 --> 02:25:08.834]  I saw it.
[02:25:09.234 --> 02:25:08.834]  3,000, 5,000.
[02:25:09.414 --> 02:25:11.495]  I mean, chicken feed.
[02:25:11.895 --> 02:25:12.315]  Pennies.
[02:25:12.435 --> 02:25:13.096]  Just pennies.
[02:25:13.296 --> 02:25:20.479]  And my brother, his mayor of Anchorage, is going to be putting forward some legislation on whistleblowing to apply to the private sector.
[02:25:20.499 --> 02:25:29.303]  I've spoken with the Assistant Attorney General yesterday and one of our legislators in Juneau who are going to try and put some legislation, hopefully together, on the same thing.
[02:25:29.483 --> 02:25:32.265]  And you've got to go on air right now to fight these monsters.
[02:25:32.365 --> 02:25:32.645]  I do.
[02:25:32.745 --> 02:25:34.746]  Where are you going to be on locally in Alaska?
[02:25:35.206 --> 02:25:47.555]  I'm on 750 AM with a good friend, Eddie Burke, another conservative here in my community, and then later today I'll be on GCN Live, and we're going to be talking about some of the other issues and some of the issues on mind control.
[02:25:47.835 --> 02:25:50.156]  We'll get back in the subject later on this afternoon.
[02:25:50.277 --> 02:25:53.659]  Okay, Dr. Baggage, the website is earthpulse.com.
[02:25:54.119 --> 02:25:55.059]  Thank you, sir.
[02:26:21.689 --> 02:26:22.953]  I'm looking forward to it, Alex.
[02:26:23.013 --> 02:26:23.695]  Always a pleasure.
[02:26:23.715 --> 02:26:24.578]  My best to everyone.
[02:26:24.638 --> 02:26:26.684]  God bless you and let's keep up the fight.
[02:26:26.745 --> 02:26:27.728]  We've got a long way to go.
[02:26:28.069 --> 02:26:28.650]  Absolutely.
[02:26:29.540 --> 02:26:37.247]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, when I see people just worshipping, I'm not saying you shouldn't have a nice car, but literally worshipping and getting off on the status.
[02:26:37.348 --> 02:26:39.389]  I mean, things to me are a hassle.
[02:26:39.650 --> 02:26:45.575]  Like, I like going out on a boat to fish, but I don't like having to mess with the boat or, you know, even comparing it with other people.
[02:26:46.036 --> 02:26:53.503]  I don't like having to, you know, mess with houses or clothes, because I think, well, it's more effective if I dress nice, but I don't care what people think about me.
[02:26:55.791 --> 02:27:03.553]  You know, it's so alien to me that somebody could screw someone, as they say, to get ahead.
[02:27:04.853 --> 02:27:07.954]  I want people just to want to work with me because I'm a nice, good person.
[02:27:07.974 --> 02:27:09.535]  I'm going to build them up, and they build me up.
[02:27:09.895 --> 02:27:10.995]  But people don't understand that.
[02:27:11.015 --> 02:27:18.237]  They think, the globalists think the pie is one size, and that they've got to control that pie to make sure they dominate it.
[02:27:18.277 --> 02:27:19.937]  They don't know you can make the pie as big as you want.
[02:27:20.723 --> 02:27:23.585]  And that's why I get so frustrated at people in our own movement that are like that.
[02:27:23.625 --> 02:27:24.885]  They just don't understand.
[02:27:25.346 --> 02:27:27.967]  And they see the world through their eyes and think everybody's like them.
[02:27:28.487 --> 02:27:30.128]  No, a lot of us aren't like you.
[02:27:30.568 --> 02:27:31.509]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:36.091 --> 02:27:37.012]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.472 --> 02:27:39.093]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.013 --> 02:27:42.695]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.184 --> 02:27:49.107]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:27:49.267 --> 02:27:54.492]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:27:54.812 --> 02:28:00.137]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:00.517 --> 02:28:01.618]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:28:01.978 --> 02:28:11.063]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:28:11.304 --> 02:28:12.924]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.
[02:28:13.145 --> 02:28:21.990]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.

[02:28:47.767 --> 02:28:49.610]  Signing into the hottest new MLM business?
[02:28:49.870 --> 02:28:51.812]  It's not that that business is not performing.
[02:28:52.013 --> 02:28:54.335]  It's simply that you don't have the proper tools to succeed.
[02:28:54.536 --> 02:28:57.900]  Take it from me, Craig Walcott, producer of Exercise is Suicide.
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:03.026]  Being in the MLM business since 1989, I've learned what it takes to be successful in any business.
[02:29:03.066 --> 02:29:03.787]  We're good to go!
[02:29:31.508 --> 02:29:32.289]  Plus so much more.
[02:29:32.449 --> 02:29:35.431]  Start making the money you expected and the money you deserve right now.

[02:29:45.598 --> 02:29:47.659]  Do you know why you get dark circles under your eyes?
[02:29:48.019 --> 02:29:51.001]  Because blood leaks out of your capillaries and pools under your skin.
[02:29:51.401 --> 02:29:52.002]  I'm not kidding.
[02:29:52.282 --> 02:29:53.483]  It's just like an ugly bruise.

[02:30:39.805 --> 02:30:40.245]  I hurt myself
[02:31:01.909 --> 02:31:09.574]  Today, to see if I still feel.
[02:31:09.915 --> 02:31:19.821]  I focus on the thing, the only thing that's real.
[02:31:20.582 --> 02:31:28.988]  The needle tears the hole, the old familiar sting.
[02:31:30.772 --> 02:31:47.272]  Try to kill it all away But I remember everything What have I become?
[02:31:48.053 --> 02:31:50.335]  My sweetest friend
[02:31:52.834 --> 02:32:09.128]  Everyone I know goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down
[02:32:34.396 --> 02:32:42.878]  I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar's chair.
[02:32:45.299 --> 02:32:53.581]  Full of broken thoughts I cannot repair.
[02:32:55.564 --> 02:33:14.861]  Beneath the stains of time The feelings disappear You are someone else I am still right here
[02:33:16.796 --> 02:33:17.477]  Welcome back.
[02:33:17.537 --> 02:33:25.405]  We're working on getting Jesse Trinidou on, lawyer, brother of a man who was killed by the FBI in custody.
[02:33:25.425 --> 02:33:27.987]  There's been some new developments on this case.
[02:33:28.007 --> 02:33:30.369]  This came out in the Desert News yesterday.
[02:33:30.490 --> 02:33:34.413]  Judges weigh charges of cover-up in death.
[02:33:34.894 --> 02:33:35.955]  Were you able to get the attorney?
[02:33:38.015 --> 02:33:38.616]  Fantastic.
[02:33:38.636 --> 02:33:39.436]  We do now have him.
[02:33:39.857 --> 02:33:42.639]  Judge weighs charges of cover-up in death.
[02:33:43.139 --> 02:33:46.361]  Salt Lake City attorney's quest to prove his brother was murdered.
[02:33:46.842 --> 02:33:47.703]  There's no doubt of that.
[02:33:47.723 --> 02:33:50.865]  It's like asking was an A-bomb dropped on Hiroshima or Nagasaki.
[02:33:51.265 --> 02:34:00.953]  In federal custody, received a bruise from judges in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, who expressed serious concerns over an alleged government cover-up of the case.
[02:34:00.973 --> 02:34:05.196]  And now he's got an affidavit from Nichols and others saying it was a government black-up.
[02:34:05.842 --> 02:34:09.470]  And we already knew all that, just like with E. Howard Hunt, it fits with the exact documents we had.
[02:34:09.751 --> 02:34:10.874]  By the way, Monday, St.
[02:34:10.914 --> 02:34:13.159]  John Hunt, for an hour and a half, take your calls.
[02:34:14.415 --> 02:34:19.880]  This is a terrible case to the 10th Circuit Judge, Robert Henry, during Oral Arguments Wednesday.
[02:34:20.180 --> 02:34:22.462]  The federal government doesn't look well for it.
[02:34:23.022 --> 02:34:33.871]  Attorney Jesse Trinidou said in an investigation into his brother's August 95 death in a federal holding facility in Oklahoma City, he ran across what he claims was a covert effort by the FBI and U.S.
[02:34:33.891 --> 02:34:37.494]  Department of Justice to cover up the circumstances surrounding the death of Kenneth Trinidou.
[02:34:37.914 --> 02:34:41.197]  Folks, I don't want to go into what happened to his brother again, but it was grisly.
[02:34:42.054 --> 02:34:51.804]  And the slitting throats, electrical burns all over the body, and bruises over 90% of the body, and a skull completely crushed in, is not hanging yourself in your cell.
[02:34:51.824 --> 02:34:57.470]  That's like in Clinton, Arkansas, the big machine gun cops off the road and say it was suicides.
[02:34:58.070 --> 02:35:03.816]  In one landfill, they cut the guy's arms and legs and head off, poured gasoline on the body, and said he committed suicide.
[02:35:04.522 --> 02:35:08.084]  I mean, see, there's no end to what they... and they had Fannie Malick certified.
[02:35:08.104 --> 02:35:12.346]  Folks, you can't cut your head and arms and legs off and pour gasoline on yourself.
[02:35:12.566 --> 02:35:14.366]  It's completely impossible!
[02:35:16.007 --> 02:35:28.873]  It's like, cop of the year, Terrence Yakey, stabbed to death, tortured, handcuffs, he told his partner, they're pulling me over, it's FBI guys, they torture him to death in a field, and then they say it's suicide and shoot him in the back of the head.
[02:35:30.126 --> 02:35:33.027]  We had Dr. Nick Bagachon and they murdered his father, the congressman.
[02:35:33.527 --> 02:35:35.088]  He's still up there exposing the corruption.
[02:35:35.428 --> 02:35:36.328]  Last week it was St.
[02:35:36.368 --> 02:35:36.888]  John Hunt.
[02:35:36.908 --> 02:35:38.989]  They killed his mother, blew her plane up.
[02:35:40.189 --> 02:35:43.110]  They clearly killed Jesse Trinidou's brother.
[02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:46.251]  These people are murderers and they kill people.
[02:35:46.892 --> 02:35:48.552]  All the time they think nothing of it.
[02:35:49.072 --> 02:35:50.173]  Let's go to Jesse Trinidou.
[02:35:50.213 --> 02:35:53.954]  I appreciate you taking time out to join us today with these big new developments.
[02:35:53.974 --> 02:35:57.255]  You've had a great victory and I thank all the folks who have been praying for you.
[02:35:57.862 --> 02:36:06.727]  Well, thank you, Mr. Jones, for having me on, and it's not a victory yet, that's just the argument, and the judges haven't decided the case yet, but... But still, I've got a saying, this looks good.
[02:36:07.347 --> 02:36:09.008]  It made me feel good, let's put it that way.
[02:36:10.989 --> 02:36:21.734]  I've never had a... The court obviously had read everything, was well aware of the circumstances of this case, and were all over the government.
[02:36:24.105 --> 02:36:28.429]  Let's go over the circumstances and what upset the court and what you're finally saying.
[02:36:28.730 --> 02:36:31.332]  The affidavit you've gotten, you're asking for a video affidavit.
[02:36:31.572 --> 02:36:32.653]  Recap it for folks.
[02:36:33.735 --> 02:36:37.238]  Well, basically it's trying to find out what happened to my brother.
[02:36:37.278 --> 02:36:40.241]  All the leads took me back to the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:36:41.082 --> 02:36:47.408]  And it now appears that my brother was killed because he fit the description of John Doe II, who was a man named Richard Lee Guthrie.
[02:36:48.132 --> 02:36:51.375]  Who was found dead in federal custody much the same way as my brother.
[02:36:51.395 --> 02:36:54.478]  Yeah, first they grabbed your brother, tortured him to death, then they grabbed Richard Lee Guthrie.
[02:36:54.938 --> 02:37:00.784]  And Guthrie supposedly hangs himself the day before he's going to give a tell-all interview about the Oklahoma City bombing.
[02:37:03.066 --> 02:37:07.329]  They killed those kids in the daycare, why not kill your brother Guthrie?
[02:37:07.349 --> 02:37:09.692]  Please continue.
[02:37:09.932 --> 02:37:13.435]  So what happened is I get
[02:37:16.152 --> 02:37:32.163]  A couple of documents leaked to me that were from the FBI Director, Louis Freeh, to the field office in Oklahoma talking about a sting operation they had at a place called Elohim City and that McVeigh had called Elohim City two days before the bombing looking for more help to carry it out.
[02:37:33.224 --> 02:37:44.151]  I filed a lawsuit to get more of those documents and a federal judge ordered them turned over to me and then now I'm in the process of asking the judge to let me take the deposition of Terry Nichols.
[02:37:46.323 --> 02:37:51.666]  The Inspector General of the United States had supposedly done an investigation of my brother's death, which is unheard of.
[02:37:51.726 --> 02:37:54.127]  The Inspector General doesn't investigate the death of an inmate.
[02:37:54.768 --> 02:38:01.051]  They investigate the Chinese spying and the FBI crime lab in major cases, not something like this.
[02:38:01.992 --> 02:38:04.453]  And he sealed the report of that investigation.
[02:38:04.773 --> 02:38:12.738]  And to my knowledge, it's the only investigation report by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice not involving national security that's been sealed.
[02:38:14.308 --> 02:38:28.996]  And then I found out from talking to people who had been participating in that investigation, had been witnesses and interviewed, that they'd been told a lie, that evidence had been destroyed, and so I filed a complaint against Inspector General Fine.
[02:38:30.036 --> 02:38:31.737]  And I don't hear anything about my complaint.
[02:38:32.377 --> 02:38:38.901]  And then finally, a couple years later, I hear back from them that they dismissed my case.
[02:38:38.961 --> 02:38:40.201]  And I said, well, how could you do that?
[02:38:40.342 --> 02:38:42.983]  They said, well, Inspector General Fine sent us
[02:38:44.223 --> 02:38:46.745]  55 pages of evidence and we felt that it cleared him.
[02:38:46.785 --> 02:38:48.707]  So we dismissed your complaint without telling you.
[02:38:50.288 --> 02:38:51.228]  I want that evidence.
[02:38:51.248 --> 02:38:52.249]  They said you can't have it.
[02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:54.771]  And I said, wait a minute.
[02:38:54.811 --> 02:38:58.594]  This is not just someone who's a border patrolman or an FBI agent.
[02:38:58.614 --> 02:39:05.679]  This is the Inspector General of the United States Department of Justice, one of the most high-ranking, powerful people in our government.
[02:39:06.539 --> 02:39:08.421]  He's charged with serious crimes.
[02:39:09.462 --> 02:39:12.063]  The complaint's dismissed secretly and I can't have the evidence?
[02:39:12.123 --> 02:39:12.864]  They said you can't have it.
[02:39:13.504 --> 02:39:23.988]  So I sued to get it, and that hearing was on that issue of getting the evidence that FINE supposedly submitted to clear his name.
[02:39:25.229 --> 02:39:30.311]  Now, let's recap if we can, what happened with Nichols.
[02:39:30.351 --> 02:39:39.655]  This is huge news, but again it came out, got glazed over, like the Hunt News, just like the BBC News with Building 7, so we're resurrecting that, and then let's get into the new development.
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:48.223]  Well, the amazing thing to me, Mr. Jones, is how no one but you and one or two other people, and most of you, picked up that story.
[02:39:48.683 --> 02:39:55.345]  The significance of the fact that Terry Nichols had written to then-Attorney General Ashcroft and said, I'm willing to tell you everything.
[02:39:56.606 --> 02:40:01.788]  And they immediately, Ashcroft and the Department of Justice issue an order that Nichols is not allowed to talk to the media.
[02:40:01.888 --> 02:40:02.768]  Yeah, they gag him.
[02:40:03.248 --> 02:40:04.369]  I'll tell you who the bad guys are!
[02:40:04.409 --> 02:40:05.169]  Gag that man!
[02:40:06.898 --> 02:40:15.044]  And basically, Mr. Nichols wants to tell what happened and the role of the United States government, especially the FBI, in the bombing.
[02:40:15.084 --> 02:40:18.707]  That they had informants throughout.
[02:40:19.267 --> 02:40:21.128]  There were a lot of people who helped McVeigh.
[02:40:21.589 --> 02:40:25.532]  The informants were actually robbing banks and armored cars with McVeigh to get the money to build the bomb.
[02:40:26.212 --> 02:40:30.055]  One of the informants, I think, was the explosives instructor who taught him how to make the bomb.
[02:40:30.995 --> 02:40:35.799]  And according to Nichols, the detonators came from an FBI informant.
[02:40:38.050 --> 02:40:44.942]  Well, and then also McVeigh talked about how he'd been brought out of the military and brought into secret black ops.
[02:40:44.962 --> 02:40:45.864]  Can you elaborate on that?
[02:40:47.384 --> 02:40:56.351]  All I know is he, and I can't say if it's true or not, but from two different sources, McVeigh told people that he was working for the government.
[02:40:56.671 --> 02:41:01.935]  That he had been recruited and was to go underground and infiltrate the militia patriot movement.
[02:41:02.515 --> 02:41:06.058]  He told Terry Nichols that, and he told a man he was on death row with.
[02:41:06.118 --> 02:41:12.223]  And that's what he did, with no job for years, he roamed all over the country to every gun show, every militia meeting, Waco, he's everywhere.
[02:41:13.233 --> 02:41:40.712]  And I heard something too, and I can't verify this is true or not, maybe someone in your audience will know about it, but I got a call from someone after that, after your story broke on that, telling me about, and I don't know if this is true, that there was an FBI operation in place in the early 1990s when McVeigh supposedly was recruited, and when this man named Strassmeier from Germany showed up in this country called PATCON, P-A-T-C-O-N.
[02:41:41.849 --> 02:41:42.889]  Patriot conspiracy.
[02:41:43.349 --> 02:41:46.210]  The objective was to infiltrate the militia Patriot movement.
[02:41:47.411 --> 02:41:48.271]  I can't find anything about that.
[02:41:48.291 --> 02:41:59.294]  I don't know about that particular name, but I know there was a huge, now declassified, program where if you were at a militia meeting, half the people there were feds, usually leading it and calling for violence.
[02:42:00.374 --> 02:42:03.915]  Well, this is all I know is someone told me that that was an operation in place.
[02:42:04.617 --> 02:42:05.558]  At the time all this was happening.
[02:42:05.578 --> 02:42:15.767]  Well that's how you discredit a movement is you infiltrate it and then lead it into violence and into heinous acts and into robberies in the name of the greater good to then burn the entire name.
[02:42:17.728 --> 02:42:24.834]  Well there's no doubt in my mind that the FBI knew in advance about the plan to blow up the Murrow building and that their people were actually provocateurs.
[02:42:25.114 --> 02:42:25.935]  Well look at how!
[02:42:25.975 --> 02:42:28.057]  Their own informants would try to stop it and they'd arrest them!
[02:42:29.613 --> 02:42:34.439]  I thought what was intriguing about her testimony was that she warned him four months beforehand about it.
[02:42:35.881 --> 02:42:36.722]  And that's on record.
[02:42:36.763 --> 02:42:37.644]  They can't debate that.
[02:42:39.858 --> 02:42:48.746]  Now, as any CIA black-off, they're going to have a lot of confusion and multi-layers, like Kennedy, Cubans, Mafia, CIA, regular hitmen.
[02:42:49.146 --> 02:42:51.628]  Of course they had some Arabs running around, too.
[02:42:51.648 --> 02:42:53.810]  That's just a little added black-off.
[02:42:53.850 --> 02:42:57.293]  I mean, I would expect they'd probably have a traveling circus, too, I mean, added to it.
[02:42:57.633 --> 02:42:58.734]  That's just what they do.
[02:42:59.215 --> 02:43:05.380]  Again, so the general mind can't grasp cloak and dagger, because it's got so many layers and fogs.
[02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:07.020]  I can't yet.
[02:43:07.040 --> 02:43:08.881]  It's still under decision.
[02:43:08.901 --> 02:43:12.522]  Basically, I obtained from Mr. Nichols a series of documents
[02:43:30.491 --> 02:43:36.513]  Implicating the FBI and the FBI informants in the bombing and when I filed them in court, the FBI had them sealed.
[02:43:39.093 --> 02:43:43.794]  But not before some of it did leak out into Utah newspapers.
[02:43:45.235 --> 02:43:49.936]  I tell you, and so we were able to cover it here, and of course that's McVeigh being a black operator.
[02:43:52.116 --> 02:43:53.557]  Can you describe what happened in the courtroom?
[02:43:53.597 --> 02:43:55.217]  How the FBI lawyers are behaving?
[02:43:55.837 --> 02:43:57.617]  What happened in there that isn't in the newspaper?
[02:44:01.691 --> 02:44:18.642]  As I said, the judges were right on top of this case, and they were immediately confronting the FBI lawyers, reminding them that the government had an obligation of truthfulness and candor to the American people, and that the American people had a right to know what the government was doing.
[02:44:20.103 --> 02:44:23.846]  And they didn't feel, I got the sense that they didn't feel like that was happening in this case, and it certainly wasn't.
[02:44:23.906 --> 02:44:26.988]  I mean, they produced to me the evidence that
[02:44:27.854 --> 02:44:30.097]  First of all, they tell the judge that they had given me the evidence.
[02:44:30.137 --> 02:44:34.082]  Well, they gave me 55 pages of which there were 350 words left.
[02:44:34.543 --> 02:44:35.804]  Everything else was blacked out.
[02:44:38.308 --> 02:44:42.994]  And the point I was making is this isn't national security material.
[02:44:43.054 --> 02:44:44.015]  This isn't...
[02:44:44.841 --> 02:44:46.123]  War plans or anything like that.
[02:44:46.143 --> 02:44:54.272]  This is the so-called evidence that the Inspector General for the United States Department of Justice submits to clear himself of serious charges.
[02:44:55.593 --> 02:44:56.755]  But it was war planning.
[02:44:56.795 --> 02:44:58.517]  This is part of the war against the American people.
[02:45:00.638 --> 02:45:07.762]  Well, that may very well be, but the judges certainly didn't seem to be very receptive to that.
[02:45:07.782 --> 02:45:10.423]  Now, the past judges have continually ruled in your favor.
[02:45:11.004 --> 02:45:12.144]  Who are these new judges?
[02:45:12.164 --> 02:45:22.970]  Because a lot of times, you know, judges will act like, for the record, that they were judicious and did way everything, and they'll do a public spanking and then basically slap on the wrist.
[02:45:24.011 --> 02:45:28.213]  What's your feel as an experienced counselor and attorney on where this is going to be going?
[02:45:29.336 --> 02:45:35.562]  Well, you know, you can't predict what the court's going to do, but these are decent people and bright people, and they'd obviously done their homework.
[02:45:36.744 --> 02:45:42.209]  And they certainly didn't seem to be very receptive to what the government had to say.
[02:45:45.292 --> 02:45:46.853]  I think that's part of the times now.
[02:45:46.913 --> 02:45:50.577]  I think after 9-11, immediately, no one wanted to say anything bad about the government.
[02:45:50.597 --> 02:45:51.358]  But I think by now,
[02:45:52.188 --> 02:45:54.869]  We've all come to realize that the government's abused that goodwill.
[02:45:55.289 --> 02:45:59.450]  Yeah, that's what happened, is they had 9-11 and boy, they just took it too far, didn't they?
[02:45:59.470 --> 02:46:04.751]  Because, I mean, I think their credibility's blown, and I don't think when they put Hillary in that that's going to help.
[02:46:05.492 --> 02:46:07.692]  I don't think it's going to help when they put that creature in.
[02:46:07.732 --> 02:46:09.393]  I think people are going to know immediately.
[02:46:09.653 --> 02:46:14.354]  I don't think this tag-team dog-and-pony show of tag-team wrestling is going to work anymore, Mr. Trinidad.
[02:46:15.334 --> 02:46:17.035]  Well, I'm concerned that
[02:46:20.368 --> 02:46:29.783]  The cover-up of the Oklahoma City bombing went right to the White House in the Clinton-Reno administration.
[02:46:29.823 --> 02:46:33.850]  There's no doubt in my mind that to run a cover-up at that level would have to be
[02:46:34.968 --> 02:46:37.371]  Well, I've got to say this for Bush.
[02:46:37.431 --> 02:46:40.514]  They don't go around just killing all the reporters and people that attack him.
[02:46:40.894 --> 02:46:45.599]  I have really been watching, and they've killed some, but it hasn't been one one-hundredth.
[02:46:45.879 --> 02:46:48.482]  The Clintons just murdered anybody that talked about them, basically.
[02:46:48.722 --> 02:46:50.183]  I mean, who really got into real stuff.
[02:46:50.544 --> 02:46:59.052]  I mean, it is concerning to see Hillary approaching... I mean, I think they're just hubris with the Bushes, but with the Clintons, I mean, they're really scary folks.
[02:47:00.292 --> 02:47:06.534]  Well, I think if the true story of the Oklahoma bombing ever got out, those chickens would certainly go home to roost with the Clintons.
[02:47:07.374 --> 02:47:09.835]  We have to do whatever it takes to keep her out of office.
[02:47:09.855 --> 02:47:10.695]  Do you agree with that statement?
[02:47:11.515 --> 02:47:14.116]  I'm not very political, but she's the same.
[02:47:14.496 --> 02:47:15.917]  Mrs. Clinton is not my choice.
[02:47:17.617 --> 02:47:20.498]  Oh man, I tell you, what a horrible choice they're going to give us.
[02:47:21.977 --> 02:47:23.478]  One of these Republicans versus Hillary?
[02:47:24.599 --> 02:47:25.559]  It's got to be Ron Paul.
[02:47:25.879 --> 02:47:31.403]  Well, sir, I just know you're a very busy man, and as this develops, thank you for coming on and giving us updates.
[02:47:31.443 --> 02:47:32.504]  We'll all keep praying for you.
[02:47:32.824 --> 02:47:34.605]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[02:47:35.285 --> 02:47:42.310]  I just think that your listeners should get a hold of the Judiciary Committee for the United States Senate and demand that they do something.
[02:47:42.790 --> 02:47:44.511]  I mean, this story is not a secret anymore.
[02:47:44.991 --> 02:47:51.075]  It's just the major media outlets just won't look at it.
[02:47:52.574 --> 02:47:53.515]  They're afraid of it, I think.
[02:47:53.855 --> 02:48:01.942]  Well, it's up to our listeners, who I ask an awful lot from, to get the stories, to get the articles we put out, to get the newest one and to continue to make it a big story.
[02:48:02.908 --> 02:48:03.968]  We are having an effect.
[02:48:04.028 --> 02:48:09.649]  It is an uphill battle, but we are making progress and none of us are safe while these killers are on the loose.
[02:48:09.990 --> 02:48:12.510]  And they're going to carry out more attacks unless we stop them.
[02:48:13.070 --> 02:48:18.651]  And that's why what you're doing, not just for your brother, but for the rest of the country and the world, is so important.
[02:48:19.071 --> 02:48:20.832]  Jesse Trinidou, thanks for spending time with us.
[02:48:20.852 --> 02:48:21.572]  Have a great weekend.
[02:48:21.992 --> 02:48:22.512]  Thank you, sir.
[02:48:22.992 --> 02:48:23.452]  Take care.
[02:48:24.112 --> 02:48:27.573]  Now, the article's judge weighs charges of cover-up and death.
[02:48:28.553 --> 02:48:30.234]  Desert Morning News came out yesterday.
[02:48:30.294 --> 02:48:31.414]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[02:48:32.742 --> 02:48:33.562]  Now, it's up to you.
[02:48:34.522 --> 02:48:35.883]  You gotta carry the ball, folks.
[02:48:36.683 --> 02:48:37.943]  We're all in this fight together.
[02:48:38.643 --> 02:48:39.703]  You gotta carry the ball.
[02:48:39.923 --> 02:48:41.424]  We'll be right back with the final segment.
[02:48:41.444 --> 02:48:41.904]  Stay with me.
[02:48:42.284 --> 02:48:49.625]  It's here.
[02:48:49.785 --> 02:48:54.586]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:54.946 --> 02:49:02.548]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.283 --> 02:49:10.327]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.727 --> 02:49:22.173]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.473 --> 02:49:25.975]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.415 --> 02:49:28.356]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.696 --> 02:49:32.538]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:45.908 --> 02:50:47.630]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.850 --> 02:50:51.554]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:51.875 --> 02:50:54.097]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.

[02:51:50.004 --> 02:51:52.465]  I'll be back on the radio this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:51:52.505 --> 02:51:54.026]  Central Standard Time.
[02:51:54.566 --> 02:51:56.827]  Hope you'll come out and join us.
[02:51:57.847 --> 02:52:00.068]  In closing, we need to get an article done on this.
[02:52:00.949 --> 02:52:13.214]  There is a shadow government, it has been set up, and now Bush doesn't even trust the Homeland Security Office to run his martial law system under the executive orders and criminal activities.
[02:52:13.234 --> 02:52:15.275]  Now it's being brought directly under the President
[02:52:16.673 --> 02:52:22.758]  I guess you take all the power from the other agencies in Congress illegally, and then you put it into an agency, and then you just remove it to yourself.
[02:52:23.198 --> 02:52:25.880]  I mean, this is the Fuhrer precept here, the Fuhrer principle.
[02:52:26.541 --> 02:52:33.527]  It says, Bush changes continuity plan administration, not DHS, Department of Homeland Security, would run shadow government.
[02:52:33.827 --> 02:52:45.176]  President Bush issued a formal national security directive yesterday, ordering agencies to prepare contingency plans for a surprise decapitating attack for the federal government, and assign responsibility for coordinating such a plan with the White House.
[02:52:46.244 --> 02:52:46.765]  Oh, man.
[02:52:47.485 --> 02:52:53.710]  That makes you be in a lot of danger, Congress, to have that be set up against you.
[02:52:54.490 --> 02:52:57.052]  Caesar has definitely crossed the Rubicon a long time ago.
[02:52:57.112 --> 02:52:58.073]  Now he's entering Rome.
[02:52:58.713 --> 02:53:11.103]  The prospect of a nuclear bomb being detonated in Washington without warning, whether smuggled in by terrorists or a foreign government, has been cited by many security analysts as a rising concern since the September 11, 2001 attacks.
[02:53:13.746 --> 02:53:21.171]  The auditor makes explicit that the focus of federal worst-case planning involves a covert nuclear attack against the nation's capital.
[02:53:21.551 --> 02:53:31.317]  In contrast, with Cold War assumptions, the long-range strike would be preceded by a notice of minutes or hours as missiles were fueled and launched.
[02:53:32.145 --> 02:53:34.108]  Yes, the missiles they handed out to everybody.
[02:53:34.648 --> 02:53:44.982]  As a result of the systematic, and it says asymmetric, threat of environment, adequate warning of potential emergencies could pose, significant risk to the homeland might not be available, and therefore all...
[02:53:45.695 --> 02:53:49.517]  Contingency planning shall be based on the assumption that no such warning will be received.
[02:53:49.897 --> 02:53:51.618]  Statute 72 page paragraph.
[02:53:52.179 --> 02:53:54.740]  So instead of being decentralized, it's totally centralized.
[02:53:54.760 --> 02:53:57.181]  The opposite of what you want for decapitation.
[02:53:57.962 --> 02:54:02.524]  This is the worst thing you want for a real decapitation attack by an outside group.
[02:54:02.824 --> 02:54:06.366]  It's perfect if it's going to be run by the executive, controlled by the New World Order.
[02:54:06.386 --> 02:54:12.510]  And it's all talk about nukes, but the real meat and potatoes is the formation of this.
[02:54:14.002 --> 02:54:19.785]  The statement added emphasis on, will be well placed upon geographic dispersion of leadership, staff, and infrastructure.
[02:54:19.805 --> 02:54:20.285]  And it goes on.
[02:54:20.785 --> 02:54:29.229]  After the 2001 attacks, Bush has signed up 100 senior civilian managers to rotate secretly locations outside Washington for weeks or months at a time to ensure the nation's survival.
[02:54:30.510 --> 02:54:32.571]  That's why Cheney disappears for weeks at a time.
[02:54:33.851 --> 02:54:43.036]  And it goes on to say, um, it has now evolved into a shadow government, a shadow government that evolved based on long-standing continuity of operations.
[02:54:44.312 --> 02:54:45.032]  And I'm out of time.
[02:54:45.413 --> 02:54:49.554]  It gets into the real meat and potatoes here in the last 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 paragraphs.
[02:54:49.935 --> 02:54:52.996]  That's up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:54:54.757 --> 02:54:57.458]  In closing, I am honored to be your host.
[02:54:57.638 --> 02:54:58.879]  I am humbled to be your host.
[02:54:59.639 --> 02:55:02.840]  I do my best job here, and I want to thank all of the best job I can.
[02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:06.042]  I certainly fall down every day, and I appreciate you helping me.
[02:55:06.642 --> 02:55:10.944]  And if it wasn't for you, the listeners, we would not be able to do what we do, and it wasn't for Jesus Christ.
[02:55:12.043 --> 02:55:13.163]  I wouldn't be able to do what I do.
[02:55:13.924 --> 02:55:17.687]  And Yahweh, I just appreciate all of you out there.
[02:55:17.707 --> 02:55:20.109]  And I appreciate and I need your prayers.
[02:55:20.229 --> 02:55:21.430]  My staff needs your prayers.
[02:55:21.450 --> 02:55:22.752]  I want to thank my crew.
[02:55:22.772 --> 02:55:23.832]  I want to thank the network.
[02:55:24.193 --> 02:55:26.094]  Genesis, I want to thank everybody out there.
[02:55:26.114 --> 02:55:28.436]  We all need to work together against the New World Order.
[02:55:28.456 --> 02:55:30.678]  None of us are going to agree with everything each other say.
[02:55:31.519 --> 02:55:39.626]  But we have to move forward and know that we need to reduce the size of government, get local control, create transparency, and punish the perpetrators of terror attacks
[02:55:40.348 --> 02:55:41.909]  Remove the mercury from the vaccines.
[02:55:42.429 --> 02:55:43.930]  You know, save the bee population.
[02:55:43.990 --> 02:55:44.791]  Basic stuff.
[02:55:45.531 --> 02:55:47.532]  And we can have a lot better world, a lot safer world.
[02:55:47.592 --> 02:55:52.235]  If not, you know, the other choice is not a choice at all.
[02:55:52.275 --> 02:55:53.275]  Total dehumanization.
[02:55:53.635 --> 02:55:54.356]  A new dark age.
