[00:00:05.469 --> 00:00:06.089]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:07.830]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.650]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.110]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.871 --> 00:00:12.771]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.431 --> 00:00:17.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:21.733]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:29.375]  Well, well, well.
[00:00:34.029 --> 00:00:35.830]  It is Friday the 13th.
[00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.391]  We'll be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:45.914]  And we're going to have wide open phones until the third hour today.
[00:00:45.954 --> 00:00:52.557]  We're going to get into the third and final part on eugenics from the 60s on.
[00:00:52.597 --> 00:01:00.721]  We went back into the 1840s and its genesis right through to its public peak
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:09.645]  In the early 1930s and then to its going underground and taking over almost every major science.
[00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:15.368]  Well, most of the modern sciences were already founded by the eugenicists for eugenics.
[00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:19.791]  First computers were developed by eugenicists for eugenicists.
[00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:27.235]  And we'll be walking through all of that through the recent past and the present and the future.
[00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:32.012]  Coming up in about an hour and a half.
[00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:40.274]  In the meantime, we're going to have open phones today.
[00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:44.675]  I'd like to give first-time crawlers a chance to get involved on air at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:44.755]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:44.775 --> 00:01:48.275]  We have a clip with Keith Uberman going after Michael Chertoff on his gut-belly feeling on the terror.
[00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:08.906]  We also have a Democratic Senator saying that impeachment is on the table for George Bush, but you have to look at the source of this statement.
[00:02:10.306 --> 00:02:17.331]  Also, we have the mother who was thrown off with her toddler son.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:45.093]  Because he was saying bye-bye plane as it was taking off and there are eyewitnesses to this and of course we have several eugenics clips one of them oldest Huxley author of the brave new world written in 1932 as if it was written today the science is so accurate saying that well his book is what the elite actually were planning to do by the year 2000 that's why it was so accurate he gave that speech
[00:02:45.888 --> 00:03:00.610]  In 1962, or 30 years after he penned Brave New World, Ron Paul, US is in danger of staged terror.
[00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:03.320]  Said that here yesterday.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:12.184]  It's a very important article, not just towards getting the word out about Ron Paul and the serious issues he covers, but also in stopping a staged terror attack.
[00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:22.730]  We'll be going over that first when we get back and how it dovetails with all the federal fear-mongering about how we've all got to brace because Al-Qaeda has rebuilt itself.
[00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:25.661]  and is infiltrated the U.S.
[00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:28.642]  and is about to hit us and hit us hard.
[00:03:28.682 --> 00:03:36.067]  We better give up all of our freedoms or Al-Qaeda will literally destroy each and every one of us, hunt us down and kill us.
[00:03:37.828 --> 00:03:38.829]  LCI Ada.
[00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.090]  So Ron Paul, U.S.
[00:03:41.291 --> 00:03:43.832]  in great danger of staged terror.
[00:03:45.033 --> 00:03:49.036]  Barbara Boxer, this is as close as we've ever come to a dictatorship.
[00:03:49.756 --> 00:03:51.277]  She also came out and said that
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.764]  El Presidente might get impeached, but it's a waffling statement.
[00:03:57.705 --> 00:04:01.168]  And that's from pressure from the Democratic constituency that's finally waking up.
[00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:07.094]  And again, as I alluded to AP reporting today, Al Qaeda works to plant U.S.
[00:04:07.255 --> 00:04:10.238]  operatives, brace for total doom.
[00:04:11.878 --> 00:04:17.219]  It's all coming up today after this first break that we're about to have.
[00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:31.623]  Don't forget the websites, the auxiliaries that are growing are Infowars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, MartialLaw911.info.
[00:04:31.843 --> 00:04:41.245]  And then the two heavy hitters, PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:04:42.896 --> 00:04:56.498]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break as we attempt to mobilize the planet against the psychopathic elite's plan to kill at least 80% of us in the near future.
[00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:07.425]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:09.708]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:17.719]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:25.444]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.864 --> 00:05:37.271]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.591 --> 00:05:41.154]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.554 --> 00:05:43.515]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:47.678]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:03.928 --> 00:06:06.710]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.133]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.553 --> 00:06:12.394]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.714 --> 00:06:17.277]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.757 --> 00:06:19.879]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:35.074]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.114 --> 00:06:42.181]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:00.854 --> 00:07:03.775]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:09.178]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.478 --> 00:07:14.780]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.301]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:25.565]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:07:25.985 --> 00:07:27.606]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.

[00:08:00.122 --> 00:08:06.127]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:06.747 --> 00:08:09.790]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:10.710]  It is...
[00:08:19.202 --> 00:08:37.887]  Very satisfying to me that I was a lone voice in the wilderness whenever Bill Clinton was in office and we saw massive preparation.
[00:08:39.087 --> 00:08:41.148]  Many of us were lone voices out there.
[00:08:42.928 --> 00:08:45.989]  Massive preparations for classical martial law.
[00:08:48.442 --> 00:09:01.594]  The old-timers were concerned back in the 60s and 70s and the 80s, long before I came along, because they would read the executive orders, the declassified versions.
[00:09:01.634 --> 00:09:03.656]  They would read presidential decision directives.
[00:09:04.256 --> 00:09:05.337]  They'd been in the military.
[00:09:05.377 --> 00:09:06.578]  They had seen the preparation.
[00:09:06.618 --> 00:09:12.684]  There has been a long, methodical, very well thought out,
[00:09:13.909 --> 00:09:23.393]  Disciplined, incremental construction of now what forms an ultra-massive complex or archipelago.
[00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:39.999]  For those who don't know what an archipelago is, it's why Alexander Shultz and Neitzin described the camps, the labor camps, thousands of them across Russia in the Stalin era and then going right up into the 90s and they're back in operation today.
[00:09:44.907 --> 00:09:49.391]  Alexander Shelton each is credited described as a gulag archipelago.
[00:09:50.932 --> 00:09:56.256]  It's kind of like the Florida Keys is a archipelago.
[00:09:56.316 --> 00:09:58.558]  It's a little string of islands.
[00:09:59.178 --> 00:10:00.319]  Hundreds of them.
[00:10:02.021 --> 00:10:06.164]  Or you go down to Belize and there is a archipelago of islands.
[00:10:08.426 --> 00:10:12.249]  And a great continents of prisons have been built here.
[00:10:14.162 --> 00:10:16.408]  Hundreds of strings of archipelagos.
[00:10:19.294 --> 00:10:22.662]  Seven million people in the system, four million behind bars.
[00:10:24.105 --> 00:10:36.493]  And thousands of other camps sitting idly with fresh coats of paint and a security guard at the front gate waiting for the fateful day to hold more than 10 million Americans.
[00:10:36.553 --> 00:10:41.295]  That's the capacity they're at at what you could call medium security facilities.
[00:10:41.716 --> 00:10:48.160]  They could hold 30, 40, 50 million in limited security sports stadium type arrangements.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.142]  Where you just herd people in and then shoot them when they try to exit.
[00:10:52.622 --> 00:10:53.603]  And that works quite well.
[00:10:57.085 --> 00:10:59.966]  You saw folks trying to walk out on the overpasses in New Orleans.
[00:11:02.347 --> 00:11:09.731]  Of course, we reported at the time correctly that the police had opened fire on innocent crowds of people and killed them.
[00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:11.332]  Now they've been convicted.
[00:11:11.352 --> 00:11:13.473]  It was all made up at the time.
[00:11:13.513 --> 00:11:16.354]  They claimed it was vigilantes firing on people.
[00:11:17.554 --> 00:11:17.955]  Looters.
[00:11:21.416 --> 00:11:24.197]  But we got the accurate reports from police and others that were there.
[00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:25.398]  And we got
[00:11:26.627 --> 00:11:28.569]  First-hand accounts from my witnesses.
[00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:32.932]  But I'm already digressing here today, which I'm the king of.
[00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:43.500]  My point is, is that I'd go on air in 96, 97, 98, 99, and I made three police state films.
[00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:53.949]  And I went and showed the Marines training with foreign armies, admitting that this was for domestic operations in the coming terror attacks on America.
[00:11:55.675 --> 00:11:58.376]  And I saw the role players saying, I'm an American.
[00:11:58.836 --> 00:12:07.720]  And then the Mr. Jones, the plainclothes Marine Corps liaison would come over and prod me and tell me I wasn't supposed to see that.
[00:12:09.261 --> 00:12:10.602]  Then we sent in cameramen.
[00:12:10.622 --> 00:12:15.904]  So they had the media tours of the drills they were doing at the former bases and off base.
[00:12:15.924 --> 00:12:17.005]  They would cordon off streets.
[00:12:17.645 --> 00:12:19.506]  And they would also have general public tours.
[00:12:21.872 --> 00:12:23.993]  And then they would have local government official tours.
[00:12:24.053 --> 00:12:34.756]  We sent in spies to both and got them showing the government tour how they were going to have people get on their knees and shoot them in the back of the head.
[00:12:36.036 --> 00:12:37.897]  We have that on video, by the way.
[00:12:37.937 --> 00:12:41.558]  You didn't stop us, Marine Corps, from defending this country.
[00:12:41.978 --> 00:12:45.759]  And you will never stop us with your treasonous masters.
[00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:47.880]  You're going to be going to prison
[00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:55.150]  So we witnessed what they were truly doing.
[00:13:01.714 --> 00:13:03.115]  And we came back and we warned you.
[00:13:03.175 --> 00:13:05.377]  And a lot of people saw those videos.
[00:13:07.438 --> 00:13:20.147]  And it was so concerning to them that we got hundreds of emails, scores of calls, calls on air saying that I had hired the troop carrying ship Coronado.
[00:13:20.167 --> 00:13:21.848]  It's an aircraft carrier.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:22.860]  We're good.
[00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:54.080]  And their proof was, again, people who are in fear and don't want to admit this is happening, their brains will skip around trying to rationalize, trying to make an excuse.
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:58.504]  They will watch it looking for something to say that isn't true.
[00:13:58.524 --> 00:14:08.693]  And in the film I pointed out that the Marines hired thousands, let's be accurate, hundreds of thousands of Marines, hundreds of role players.
[00:14:10.262 --> 00:14:12.743]  Who would scream, I'm an American, please know not to camp.
[00:14:13.044 --> 00:14:19.487]  And so people seized on that and wrote little internet stories saying, oh no, it was all actors, the Marines weren't real either.
[00:14:20.507 --> 00:14:22.889]  Because I pointed out in the film that they hired role players.
[00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:28.632]  Now, they could have easily gone to the Marine Corps' website, Urban Warrior, 1999.
[00:14:32.094 --> 00:14:34.495]  Or they could have gone to the hundreds and hundreds.
[00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:40.314]  Of city takeover drills the Marines did in a couple year period then, and are still doing.
[00:14:42.515 --> 00:14:47.619]  They could have gone to the microfilm and FISH and pulled it up.
[00:14:47.659 --> 00:14:49.040]  They could have searched on the web.
[00:14:49.701 --> 00:14:50.721]  They didn't do that!
[00:14:52.362 --> 00:14:53.804]  They just said, I'm a liar!
[00:14:55.345 --> 00:15:03.631]  And that I have control of aircraft carriers, helicopters, jets, warrior fighting vehicles,
[00:15:09.528 --> 00:15:33.318]  At the time I told the Hollywood director about it, Rick Linklater, saw Police State 2000, he called me and he said, we were already friends, and he said, this is an incredible documentary, you know, I was telling some people, he was on a movie set, about it, he was out in LA, I was telling some folks on the set about it, some of them had been actors there, and had been hired by the Marines to play the part of Americans, and they confirmed it, and he goes, my gosh, this is scary!
[00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:39.360]  And I said, well, people don't believe it's real, they think all of it was actors.
[00:15:40.177 --> 00:15:47.839]  He said, that's ridiculous, this would cost 50 million dollars, even if you had the military helping you.
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.101]  But see, none of that even matters to those that are in denial.
[00:15:54.401 --> 00:16:05.164]  It's the same thing where they'll email me every day, you know, check the big message boards, I check them for great leads and infos, there's such great writers and thinkers and researchers on there, I find stuff every day.
[00:16:06.371 --> 00:16:34.129]  You know, links they put up and things, but I'll see people in there going, it's not true, there's no North American Union, Ron Paul didn't agree with Alex that we're in danger of stage terror, Cindy Sheehan didn't say it, it's all made up, there's no preparation for martial law, and then you click on these people's favorite stories they like to post, you go to their page on Digg, and there I have little celebration pages about, oh look,
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.801]  It's in the local newspaper.
[00:16:37.921 --> 00:16:40.802]  A man was arrested for talking about 9-11 truth.
[00:16:41.142 --> 00:16:47.985]  The police arrested him saying he was mentally ill for bringing some DVDs by the police station.
[00:16:48.005 --> 00:16:49.605]  This is a new story I just learned of last night.
[00:16:50.746 --> 00:16:51.446]  Happened in May.
[00:16:52.946 --> 00:16:53.547]  Didn't know about it.
[00:16:53.567 --> 00:16:54.507]  I'm sure there's hundreds we don't.
[00:16:55.127 --> 00:16:56.708]  And he just went by
[00:16:57.708 --> 00:17:04.751]  The police station gave him some DVDs and they later came back and arrested him saying he was mentally ill because he believed the government was involved.
[00:17:04.771 --> 00:17:08.533]  And this guy was having a celebration on his site for it.
[00:17:08.993 --> 00:17:25.741]  So he's on our dig page for the Ron Paul story, or was it Cindy Sheehan, I forget, saying that none of this exists and there isn't a police state and we're not in danger.
[00:17:27.099 --> 00:17:32.882]  And then I go to his subpage for his favorite articles he's dug, that he's posted.
[00:17:33.943 --> 00:17:38.445]  And it's a celebration of people having their free speech violated and being arrested for thought crime.
[00:17:38.465 --> 00:17:44.108]  I mean, there he is, celebrating hardcore police state.
[00:17:45.709 --> 00:17:55.594]  And then he's over on... For those that don't know how this works, we post an article, or somebody posts an article we've written, on dig.com, D-I-G-G dot com.
[00:17:57.006 --> 00:18:00.327]  People voted up or down to the main page, and millions of people have a chance to read it.
[00:18:01.087 --> 00:18:06.549]  It's a very effective chink of the Newell-Loehr info-armor to get stuff out nationally.
[00:18:06.589 --> 00:18:09.369]  It's hundreds of times bigger than the Drudge Report in its rankings.
[00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:16.171]  But there are people that come on and dig us down and try to keep us off the main page, and that comment.
[00:18:17.751 --> 00:18:23.833]  And they'll deny there's a police state, but then again, you go to their page on Digg, and it's a celebration of the police state.
[00:18:26.149 --> 00:18:27.509]  Ha ha, look at this idiot.
[00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:32.371]  He was handing out 9-11 truth stuff and the police arrested him saying he's mentally ill.
[00:18:32.411 --> 00:18:33.631]  Isn't that great?
[00:18:33.931 --> 00:18:35.171]  We ought to go after all of them.
[00:18:35.211 --> 00:18:36.292]  We ought to arrest all of them.
[00:18:40.393 --> 00:18:45.274]  And that's the hardcore denial that we're talking about.
[00:18:45.294 --> 00:18:48.354]  They'll deny Amnesty is Amnesty.
[00:18:48.615 --> 00:18:50.535]  They'll deny Bush was for the assault weapons ban.
[00:18:50.915 --> 00:18:54.456]  They'll deny that the biggest gun control law since 1968 was passed a month ago.
[00:18:55.265 --> 00:18:56.926]  They'll deny North American Union.
[00:18:57.466 --> 00:18:58.747]  They'll deny SPP.
[00:18:59.888 --> 00:19:09.194]  They'll deny that the White House put out a press release saying they're using a mainline Al-Qaeda group, two of them, to attack Iran while they accuse Iran of being Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:09.794 --> 00:19:11.676]  They can't even grasp the statement I just made.
[00:19:12.096 --> 00:19:13.076]  Basic and simple.
[00:19:14.237 --> 00:19:20.761]  They've got a made-up, myopic, almost religious worldview, and they will go down with the ship, folks.
[00:19:20.781 --> 00:19:22.402]  They will do whatever they're told.
[00:19:22.783 --> 00:19:24.604]  They will believe whatever they're told.
[00:19:26.428 --> 00:19:28.749]  And don't think we're out of the woods when some Democrats get elected.
[00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:34.070]  It's gonna be the same mindset of people just with a liberal paint job.
[00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:38.051]  Coke and Pepsi, that's about as big a difference as there is.
[00:19:38.491 --> 00:19:39.211]  Ford and Chevy.
[00:19:41.552 --> 00:19:43.553]  And it'll be a reign of terror with these guys.
[00:19:45.233 --> 00:19:55.816]  I mean, when people watch video of Marines trying to put you and your family in camps and blow your heads off, and they say it's fake without even trying to check it out, we got a problem.
[00:20:00.174 --> 00:20:02.256]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:02.877 --> 00:20:11.807]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:12.248 --> 00:20:19.456]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:20.169 --> 00:20:25.674]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:20:26.154 --> 00:20:36.983]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:20:37.744 --> 00:20:39.746]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:21:00.442 --> 00:21:06.571]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live with an urgent message regarding Ed and Elaine Brown and their brave stand against the IRS.
[00:21:07.232 --> 00:21:17.346]  WTPRN.com and GCNLive.com join together to organize and promote the Live Free or Die concert on Saturday, July 14th in Plainfield, New Hampshire.
[00:21:17.606 --> 00:21:28.231]  Aside from a day of great music from bands like Poker Face, Dave Von Kleist, Blue Eyed Fools, Paperback Radio, and many more, the true purpose of this event is to come to the defense of Ed and Elaine Brown.
[00:21:28.431 --> 00:21:32.293]  Friends, we're also in need of donations to cover costs of staging this historic event.
[00:21:32.513 --> 00:21:39.456]  Ed and Elaine Brown have put their lives on the line to stand up to the IRS's tyranny, so please give generously to help this concert become a success.
[00:21:39.716 --> 00:21:49.427]  Join me, Randy Weaver, and more surprise guests on July 14th to become part of this effort to defend the Browns, as it is literally a matter of life and death.
[00:21:49.568 --> 00:21:56.636]  Again, go to WTPRN.com or GCNlive.com and click on the Live Free or Die banner for all the information.
[00:21:56.836 --> 00:21:57.477]  I hope to see you there.
[00:22:00.931 --> 00:22:05.433]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:05.773 --> 00:22:09.875]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:10.155 --> 00:22:10.695]  We listened.
[00:22:11.015 --> 00:22:15.997]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:16.257 --> 00:22:16.757]  We listened.
[00:22:17.137 --> 00:22:20.179]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:20.599 --> 00:22:21.139]  We listened.
[00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:25.641]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:26.522]  We listened.
[00:22:26.862 --> 00:22:32.107]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:22:32.508 --> 00:22:33.869]  Again, we listened.
[00:22:34.249 --> 00:22:35.831]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:22:36.011 --> 00:22:41.577]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:22:42.017 --> 00:22:44.659]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[00:22:44.859 --> 00:22:45.039]  Only $279.
[00:22:45.079 --> 00:22:45.700]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:45.980]  That's 888-03-4438.

[00:22:47.681 --> 00:22:48.641]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:58.777 --> 00:23:01.878]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.
[00:23:02.058 --> 00:23:04.799]  We are now offering a critically important $10 package.

[00:23:18.243 --> 00:23:20.084]  You also get another 335-page book and other material.

[00:23:24.807 --> 00:23:28.169]  The last word monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.
[00:23:28.369 --> 00:23:35.095]  At the website you can watch all of our videos for free, read sample chapters of the new book and other articles, or call us 24 hours a day at 1-800-275-1126.

[00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:50.429]  The price of the whole package is $10, which includes media mail shipping.

[00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:56.475]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com
[00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:07.636]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:08.237 --> 00:24:11.241]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.505 --> 00:24:18.050]  By the way, since I've been talking about police state in such length,
[00:24:19.073 --> 00:24:22.175]  My three original police state films are in the DVD box set.
[00:24:22.235 --> 00:24:24.036]  Three DVDs for $34.95.
[00:24:25.277 --> 00:24:29.759]  That is 45% off the regular price and available at InfoWars.com.
[00:24:29.779 --> 00:24:33.021]  I hope you'll get the DVDs and burn copies forever.
[00:24:34.542 --> 00:24:36.263]  Because now people are receptive.
[00:24:36.283 --> 00:24:39.785]  Now they don't just say, oh, that's a fake aircraft carrier.
[00:24:39.805 --> 00:24:41.146]  Those are fake helicopters.
[00:24:41.606 --> 00:24:43.047]  Our Marines aren't doing that.
[00:24:43.067 --> 00:24:45.548]  No, usually they've already had them in their town doing the drill.
[00:24:46.209 --> 00:24:48.190]  Yeah, those guys pulled me over!
[00:24:48.877 --> 00:24:50.778]  We got video of that in Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:24:51.819 --> 00:24:54.581]  Yeah, there were Marines took over my city all!
[00:24:54.601 --> 00:24:57.503]  Man, oh, that video's real!
[00:24:58.184 --> 00:24:59.985]  See, this isn't 1999.
[00:25:00.426 --> 00:25:02.667]  This isn't Kansas anymore, Toto.
[00:25:04.469 --> 00:25:05.610]  But it is good.
[00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:09.933]  It's not good that all these bad things are happening, but at least it's good that people are responding and awake.
[00:25:09.973 --> 00:25:15.457]  I mean, like a year and a half ago, Bob Woodward, of all people,
[00:25:16.115 --> 00:25:21.617]  He gave a big speech in San Antonio at a college and said, Bush wants to become a dictator, we should go under martial law.
[00:25:23.078 --> 00:25:36.663]  And there have just been hundreds of prominent law professors and scholars and conservatives and people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and just so many others that have said this country's in grave danger and yes, the preparations have been made.
[00:25:37.343 --> 00:25:40.144]  And then Tommy Franks, it turned out, was on CIA payroll.
[00:25:41.164 --> 00:25:43.125]  Apart all that illegal funding of media people.
[00:25:43.891 --> 00:25:49.495]  When he was also a Fox News analyst going on, going, I'm real sorry to say it, but it's what the people want.
[00:25:50.516 --> 00:25:52.938]  Martial law and military form of government.
[00:25:53.438 --> 00:25:55.380]  The Constitution will be set aside.
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:56.040]  That's a quote.
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:26:01.044]  When I'm set aside the Constitution, let me put on a fake Midland accent for you.
[00:26:01.064 --> 00:26:02.785]  You can trust me.
[00:26:04.546 --> 00:26:05.567]  And people went, what?
[00:26:05.587 --> 00:26:08.189]  Remember, that was three years ago.
[00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:10.671]  He made the rounds saying that.
[00:26:13.155 --> 00:26:14.056]  Floating the balloon.
[00:26:14.136 --> 00:26:15.317]  I mean, they're telegraphing it.
[00:26:15.677 --> 00:26:19.460]  They're saying, martial law, and then they funded it, set it up.
[00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:21.702]  I mean, it's in place last year.
[00:26:22.542 --> 00:26:23.403]  Now into this year.
[00:26:23.763 --> 00:26:25.244]  Now already seven months into this year.
[00:26:28.347 --> 00:26:29.988]  And does that mean they're going to pull the trigger?
[00:26:30.629 --> 00:26:31.870]  No, it doesn't mean they're going to pull the trigger.
[00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:37.454]  But it means they got their finger on it, folks, and they are not completely sane.
[00:26:39.281 --> 00:26:40.581]  And they're backs against a wall.
[00:26:40.621 --> 00:26:41.982]  Now they were going to pull the trigger.
[00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:44.403]  If we went along with them, they were going to go all the way.
[00:26:45.223 --> 00:26:48.644]  So don't think that since we're fighting them, it's forcing them to do it.
[00:26:49.364 --> 00:26:51.625]  It's kind of like they're going to attack us.
[00:26:51.865 --> 00:26:52.845]  Well, there's nothing like it.
[00:26:52.965 --> 00:26:53.686]  It's like a fight.
[00:26:57.947 --> 00:27:00.928]  As soon as somebody starts taking a swing at you, you don't have to let them connect.
[00:27:02.308 --> 00:27:06.730]  And we can either stand here and let them just cold cock us with our shields down or
[00:27:08.564 --> 00:27:12.787]  We could see the New World Order rearing back to punch us and we started exposing it.
[00:27:13.727 --> 00:27:15.168]  And so we're ducking the punch.
[00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.291]  But it looks like they're going to go ahead and swing.
[00:27:20.892 --> 00:27:30.718]  And we all know in our gut we're going to wake up one morning with a city nuked or bioweapons released and whether it's Hillary Clinton or George Bush or it could even be the President after her, though I doubt it.
[00:27:30.778 --> 00:27:32.539]  It's sooner rather than later.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.281]  And they're going to make the announcement.
[00:27:37.316 --> 00:27:43.920]  And a lot of people at first, who are even awake, are going to be in fear and they're going to say, look, I just want law and order.
[00:27:44.901 --> 00:27:49.623]  I'll go along with them for now, hoping that the martial law isn't too bad.
[00:27:49.783 --> 00:27:59.089]  And if you don't hit the streets at the minute they do this, if you don't call and talk radio the second they do this, of course that will be taken over for a few days or longer with government broadcast.
[00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:02.451]  If you don't take action the second that develops,
[00:28:05.234 --> 00:28:09.175]  Then they're going to be able to, in an organized fashion, move against the populace, and then they're going to win.
[00:28:10.115 --> 00:28:17.997]  I mean, they could even stage a terror attack, and then if we don't respond correctly, they'll even... I mean, they could even hype down the nuking of a major city.
[00:28:18.877 --> 00:28:19.117]  Really!
[00:28:19.177 --> 00:28:28.699]  I mean, if they were to, say, blow 20, 30 city blocks away and radiate the rest of, you know, half a town, and the public didn't respond the way they wanted, you wouldn't even hear about it in the news three weeks later.
[00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:29.959]  They would hype it down.
[00:28:31.724 --> 00:28:33.686]  That's how slick they are!
[00:28:35.187 --> 00:28:58.865]  So, they're studying us coldly, calculating, they are measuring us, they are tracking everything we do, they're studying our psychology, they're sampling with their NSA systems the chatter, what the feeling of the population is, is there a positive mention of the government or a negative mention?
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.664]  And they know that about 90% of people are really freaked out now.
[00:29:05.144 --> 00:29:13.491]  And because once we got to the 70% last year, remember I told you it would just take just a matter of months for it to accelerate to 80, then 90%?
[00:29:15.312 --> 00:29:17.614]  It's now 90 plus percent against open borders.
[00:29:18.235 --> 00:29:20.296]  It's now 80 plus percent against gun control.
[00:29:21.077 --> 00:29:25.861]  It's now... In every demographic the people have woken up.
[00:29:26.361 --> 00:29:28.523]  Now they don't have all the details, but they're awake now.
[00:29:29.634 --> 00:29:40.737]  So when we get back, we'll tell you about what Ron Paul said here yesterday that's getting a lot of attention, and it should, and how it's satisfying to have been called a kook about the police state, and now people aren't laughing anymore, are they?
[00:29:49.258 --> 00:29:50.179]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.639 --> 00:29:52.279]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.179 --> 00:29:55.860]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.170 --> 00:30:02.091]  Where do you think one of the most toxic places on earth is?
[00:30:02.391 --> 00:30:03.631]  The answer may surprise you.
[00:30:03.811 --> 00:30:04.791]  It's in your body.
[00:30:05.051 --> 00:30:08.872]  The colon is a natural breeding ground for disease-producing germs.
[00:30:09.152 --> 00:30:13.274]  It may not sound like a very appealing subject, but it should not go ignored.

[00:31:02.247 --> 00:31:06.950]  Did you know that the Bible forecasts signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[00:31:07.531 --> 00:31:14.236]  The Book of Revelation says that world travel, quickly and efficiently, would be one sign, and also knowledge would increase.
[00:31:14.716 --> 00:31:15.277]  We're good to go.
[00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.450]  516-8736.

[00:31:59.496 --> 00:32:03.445]  Hi, my name's Don Whiskin and for over seven years I've been telling people about Cardivite.
[00:32:03.746 --> 00:32:07.295]  Here's Dr. John Mattson, a naturopathic doctor, and his views on Cardivite.
[00:32:09.215 --> 00:32:12.756]  I'm making my job so much easier, because your products just make it so simple, right?
[00:32:12.796 --> 00:32:18.337]  To fool around with a lot of exotic things that don't work, we can just put them on cardivite and things start to work almost right away.
[00:32:18.597 --> 00:32:33.720]  I've had dozens and dozens of patients with heart problems who have corrected them, and what it's doing, there's so much garlic in there that has a yeast killing effect, that yeast is a big problem in the gut, pushes the liver hard, it also has metal chelating effect, and most of the other herbs in there I find that
[00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:35.942]  To learn more call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at heartdrop.com
[00:33:09.917 --> 00:33:25.206]  At a glance, I looked at you But just to say it, I felt brand new For you I look at you If I made a pass at you What would you say that we went through?
[00:33:40.177 --> 00:33:41.037]  Welcome back.
[00:33:41.097 --> 00:33:50.059]  Thank you, Jimmy Vaughn, for bringing us in.
[00:33:50.319 --> 00:33:51.519]  You know, it's really simple.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:56.120]  Very simple.
[00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:03.322]  They're not going to be able to carry this stuff out unless they get our consent, our acquiescence, and we're not going to give it to them.
[00:34:04.463 --> 00:34:21.851]  And for those of you that are thinking about going along with all this, you think you're going to join it, make money off of it, serve it, or you're just afraid and you fall down in front of any force, the best way to meet an unreasonable force, it'd be one thing if they were trying to, you know, bring us liberty and freedom.
[00:34:21.951 --> 00:34:22.771]  They're not, folks.
[00:34:23.592 --> 00:34:25.793]  The New World Order is bringing us tyranny.
[00:34:26.373 --> 00:34:28.134]  The New World Order is bringing us enslavement.
[00:34:28.614 --> 00:34:32.476]  The New World Order are a bunch of cold-blooded freaks, a bunch of control freaks.
[00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:43.094]  And they're trying to destroy our country's sovereignty, its borders, its culture, its economic system, and they've done a really good job of it.
[00:34:43.634 --> 00:34:46.876]  I mean, the country is in decline by every indicator.
[00:34:47.917 --> 00:34:52.599]  The country is in decline by every single indices.
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:59.723]  And it's not just in moderate decline, it is in deep, deep, deep decline.
[00:35:00.443 --> 00:35:01.384]  And I don't like that.
[00:35:02.146 --> 00:35:03.367]  I like the United States.
[00:35:03.407 --> 00:35:05.449]  This is where my family's from.
[00:35:07.131 --> 00:35:13.838]  I didn't have a family at Georgetown in the first settlement, but I had on two different sides of my family.
[00:35:14.318 --> 00:35:19.443]  Family at Plymouth Rock on the Mayflower.
[00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:23.847]  One was a carpenter and one a barrel maker.
[00:35:24.668 --> 00:35:25.309]  Nothing fancy.
[00:35:26.221 --> 00:35:32.222]  And I had family at every level intimately of the war for independence in Texas.
[00:35:32.702 --> 00:35:33.822]  And I love this country.
[00:35:35.083 --> 00:35:36.243]  And I love my heritage.
[00:35:37.843 --> 00:35:41.504]  And I had a lot of ancestors in the Revolutionary War.
[00:35:41.524 --> 00:35:43.904]  I had ancestors, as we've looked it up, who died.
[00:35:44.765 --> 00:35:45.405]  Quite a few of them.
[00:35:47.185 --> 00:35:51.406]  And I like the Bill of Rights.
[00:35:51.446 --> 00:35:52.326]  I like the Constitution.
[00:35:55.129 --> 00:35:56.070]  I've been to other countries.
[00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:57.151]  I like the United States.
[00:35:59.953 --> 00:36:08.799]  And I really like the fact that we were once a free country where a man could walk with his head high regardless of what his family name was or where he was from or how much money he had.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.982]  And the people were innocent until proven guilty.
[00:36:14.243 --> 00:36:17.285]  And the cops didn't act like shiftless gang members.
[00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.547]  They acted respectful and professional.
[00:36:24.085 --> 00:36:26.446]  I don't like seeing our great republic go down the toilet.
[00:36:27.707 --> 00:36:29.048]  And I'm going to be quite frank with you.
[00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:33.550]  It's not just that I have some romantic love affair with this country, though I do.
[00:36:35.031 --> 00:36:37.252]  It's a lot deeper than just some romanticism.
[00:36:40.234 --> 00:36:41.655]  This is where my family lives.
[00:36:42.055 --> 00:36:43.576]  This is where my children live.
[00:36:43.676 --> 00:36:44.917]  This is where we have roots.
[00:36:46.057 --> 00:36:46.938]  There's nowhere to run.
[00:36:46.978 --> 00:36:48.018]  This is a world government.
[00:36:49.379 --> 00:36:50.280]  There's nowhere to hide.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:52.701]  Our backs are against the wall.
[00:36:55.322 --> 00:36:57.383]  We don't have another homeland.
[00:36:59.063 --> 00:37:00.604]  We don't have another place to go.
[00:37:00.624 --> 00:37:05.306]  And it's the same thing for the British as the trader.
[00:37:06.966 --> 00:37:10.848]  Gordon Brown tries to bring them under EU control without a vote.
[00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:16.610]  It's the same thing in Germany, Russia, China, Mexico.
[00:37:17.450 --> 00:37:19.691]  We're all controlled by the same New World Order central banks.
[00:37:20.551 --> 00:37:22.812]  Japan, South Korea,
[00:37:25.796 --> 00:37:38.080]  The New World Order, Italy, Chile, Brazil, we are under New World Order attack.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:38.920]  It's free humanity.
[00:37:40.741 --> 00:37:41.921]  And we have to realize that.
[00:37:41.941 --> 00:37:51.624]  We have to first realize there's an enemy, that they're attacking us, and that they use phony enemies so they can corral us under their control to not notice that they're the true enemy.
[00:37:52.392 --> 00:37:55.875]  Now, I know we got Jim and David and Jonathan and Jeremiah.
[00:37:56.155 --> 00:37:59.177]  Paul wasn't able to get on yesterday at the end of the show, so I'm going to go to him first in a minute.
[00:37:59.437 --> 00:38:02.479]  Let me just scan through some of this stuff real fast.
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:03.280]  Where is it here?
[00:38:09.324 --> 00:38:10.345]  Drives me crazy, folks.
[00:38:10.385 --> 00:38:12.727]  I get big stacks of news in here and don't ever cover 10% of it.
[00:38:13.007 --> 00:38:15.409]  And I start trying to scan through it and there's no way to get to all of it.
[00:38:18.015 --> 00:38:19.397]  Ron Paul, U.S.
[00:38:19.717 --> 00:38:22.359]  in great danger of staged terror.
[00:38:25.182 --> 00:38:36.774]  Congressman and presidential candidate warns of economic collapse precipitated by bombing of Iran.
[00:38:38.331 --> 00:38:40.452]  Presidential candidate Ron Paul says the U.S.
[00:38:40.512 --> 00:38:56.300]  is in great danger of a staged terror attack or a Gulf of Tonkin style provocation, while also warning that a major collapse of the American economy is on the horizon and could be precipitated by the bombing of Iran and the closure of the Persian Gulf.
[00:38:57.921 --> 00:39:04.965]  Speaking to the Alex Jones Show, the Texas Congressman was asked his opinion on Cindy Sheehan's recent comments
[00:39:05.675 --> 00:39:06.355]  That the U.S.
[00:39:06.395 --> 00:39:25.967]  is in danger of a staged terror attack or a Gulf of Tonkin-style provocation that will validate the neocon agenda and lead to the implementation of an infrastructure of martial law that Bush recently signed into law via executive order, as well as public pronouncements from prominent officials that the West needs terrorism to save a doomed foreign policy.
[00:39:27.428 --> 00:39:31.310]  He responded to my statement by saying, I think we are in great danger of it,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:32.920]  Responded the Congressman.
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.861]  We're in great danger in many ways.
[00:39:35.241 --> 00:39:47.185]  The attack on our civil liberties here at home, the foreign policy that is in shambles, and our obligations overseas, and commitment which endangers our troops and our national defense.
[00:39:49.586 --> 00:39:58.489]  Every day we're in worse shape and right now there's an orchestrated effort to blame the Iranians for everything that's gone wrong in Iraq and we're
[00:39:59.511 --> 00:40:13.302]  I'm quite concerned that the attack will be on Iran and that that will jeopardize so many more of our troops, so I would say that we're in much greater danger than we ever were four or five years ago, asserted Paul.
[00:40:14.583 --> 00:40:15.123]  Did you hear that?
[00:40:15.243 --> 00:40:16.304]  Greater danger of terror.
[00:40:18.126 --> 00:40:25.912]  The presidential candidate expressed his despair that the situation in Iraq will not change until there is a total collapse of the American economy.
[00:40:26.522 --> 00:40:37.046]  There's no way we can afford what we're doing, whether it's domestic spending or the international spending, and very few people talk about the real cost of economical speaking.
[00:40:37.627 --> 00:40:48.031]  This is unsustainable and it will be a threat to our dollar, said Paul, adding that the onset of the meltdown could be sparked by the bombing of Iran and the closure of the Persian Gulf.
[00:40:48.451 --> 00:40:52.513]  The congressman added that the collapse was in the early stages with a major
[00:40:53.323 --> 00:41:05.053]  Indication being a reduction in the living standards of the middle class Americans, but that one single major world event could change things overnight and precipitate a major downturn.
[00:41:06.167 --> 00:41:13.816]  Paul added that there had not been a national discussion on monetary policy in many, many years and that the increasingly bleak outlook for the U.S.
[00:41:13.876 --> 00:41:21.825]  economy was also bringing more attention to solutions the Congressman has proposed for reducing the burden of the mammoth national deficit.
[00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:23.828]  Paul said the national debt
[00:41:24.938 --> 00:41:37.006]  The national and world events, especially the degrading situation in Iraq, were attracting support for his presidential campaign due to his resolute opposition on embracing a non-interventionist foreign policy.
[00:41:37.386 --> 00:41:46.512]  The Congressman concluded by summarizing that record lows in approval ratings for Bush, Cheney, and Congress showed that the American people are alive and well and disgusted
[00:41:48.115 --> 00:41:50.037]  Yet they haven't had good alternatives.
[00:41:50.097 --> 00:41:51.017]  It's justifiable.
[00:41:51.398 --> 00:41:54.040]  They're looking for true answers and options.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.964]  And quite frankly, I think that's probably one of the reasons why our campaign is growing by leaps and bounds right now.
[00:42:02.266 --> 00:42:07.250]  Now, the people who are also on Digg, who dug it down and are trying to stop it from hitting the main page.
[00:42:07.811 --> 00:42:08.491]  You gonna let them do that?
[00:42:09.792 --> 00:42:13.955]  They are also saying Ron Paul didn't say this when there's an MP3 right there.
[00:42:15.417 --> 00:42:17.158]  But again, they just deny everything.
[00:42:17.834 --> 00:42:18.514]  Deny, deny.
[00:42:18.555 --> 00:42:19.435]  What did Bill Clinton say?
[00:42:19.455 --> 00:42:22.677]  You deny, deny, deny, deny, deny, and then deny again.
[00:42:25.619 --> 00:42:26.219]  What was the quote?
[00:42:26.359 --> 00:42:27.119]  Always deny.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.861]  Deny, deny, deny, deny, and then deny again.
[00:42:33.043 --> 00:42:34.223]  Let's get one thing straight.
[00:42:34.283 --> 00:42:36.645]  I did not have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[00:42:36.725 --> 00:42:38.326]  I don't appreciate you saying that.
[00:42:42.168 --> 00:42:43.409]  It's the same thing with these people.
[00:42:43.449 --> 00:42:47.391]  They just... and Americans somehow got convinced that lying was okay.
[00:42:48.163 --> 00:42:54.229]  Folks, if they'll lie about a war, they'll lie about the value of your dollar, and they'll lie about your pension funds.
[00:42:54.269 --> 00:42:55.250]  I mean, do you understand that?
[00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:57.872]  Lying isn't good.
[00:43:01.756 --> 00:43:06.620]  I'm trying to eradicate lying in my life, and don't say you don't lie out there, folks.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.242]  It's inbred into us.
[00:43:09.252 --> 00:43:11.794]  But I'm trying to get to the point of, my wife says, does this look good?
[00:43:11.814 --> 00:43:15.777]  In the past, you know how women are, they don't want to, they ask you that, but they don't want to know the truth.
[00:43:16.357 --> 00:43:17.138]  No, it doesn't look good.
[00:43:17.678 --> 00:43:20.300]  I just won't, I'm trying to get more and more blunt with everybody.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.342]  And I'm not even, I'm getting to the point where I don't even tell white lies anymore.
[00:43:25.524 --> 00:43:33.689]  And if I catch myself exaggerating, I'll go, oh, that's an exaggeration around the office, or I'll, uh, that's just what I'm doing.
[00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:35.651]  It's just better, it's more honest.
[00:43:36.457 --> 00:43:39.039]  But I mean, instead we've got a culture that is the complete opposite.
[00:43:39.079 --> 00:43:44.883]  It's just lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie.
[00:43:50.208 --> 00:43:51.689]  Let's play a clip here.
[00:43:51.709 --> 00:43:53.050]  This is Barbara Boxer.
[00:43:53.070 --> 00:43:54.251]  I'm with Ed Schultz yesterday.
[00:43:54.931 --> 00:44:00.395]  Now again, she did everything she could to vote for proposals for martial law, police state.
[00:44:02.697 --> 00:44:05.099]  She did all she could to use Oklahoma City to take our liberties.
[00:44:06.764 --> 00:44:08.626]  Barbara Boxer is as bad as it gets.
[00:44:09.627 --> 00:44:19.255]  But here's Air America and those other groups trying to always foist these establishment AIPAC minions on the American people.
[00:44:20.396 --> 00:44:22.478]  Now, she's being forced to talk like this now.
[00:44:22.558 --> 00:44:24.219]  She just said a few months ago, no impeachment.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.440]  Just like Pelosi.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.562]  Because there's a revolt in their own party.
[00:44:29.864 --> 00:44:31.786]  And I say, good for the Democrats, continue to revolt.
[00:44:32.226 --> 00:44:34.488]  But don't let this type of talk pacify you.
[00:44:35.231 --> 00:44:36.971]  We want to see impeachment now.
[00:44:37.611 --> 00:44:44.593]  I mean, when the President had implemented memos saying they could torture children and they were above the law, goodbye, you're gone, right there.
[00:44:45.113 --> 00:44:49.734]  There's hundreds, no, no, no, no, thousands of reasons to impeach these people.
[00:44:53.094 --> 00:44:57.435]  But see, the Democratic Party has no moral standing to call for all this because they're the same group, they're criminal.
[00:44:58.095 --> 00:45:03.196]  It's like Hillary Clinton criticizing the pardons when they were pardoning Coke dealers and
[00:45:03.977 --> 00:45:11.082]  Foreign intelligence agents and... I mean, openly, they had a meeting saying one million dollars for pardon.
[00:45:11.122 --> 00:45:12.123]  I mean, it was public.
[00:45:12.924 --> 00:45:15.966]  And then, by the way, Republicans, that doesn't give you a defense to defend Bush.
[00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:17.827]  See, both of them think it cancels out.
[00:45:18.107 --> 00:45:23.651]  Well, they're pardoning cocaine dealers and money launderers and Mossad agents like Mark Rich.
[00:45:24.052 --> 00:45:30.076]  So, we're allowed to pardon someone in White House
[00:45:31.187 --> 00:45:32.008]  Criminal actions.
[00:45:32.068 --> 00:45:34.770]  And they say, oh, it was just a lying to the FBI.
[00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:36.131]  That's not what that was about.
[00:45:36.171 --> 00:45:40.354]  It was about, run by, by the way, the Attorney General, who says they're above the law.
[00:45:41.916 --> 00:45:46.920]  It was about all sorts of criminal activity and shredding documents and lying.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:48.861]  But look, I'm already digressing and I want to get to your calls.
[00:45:49.122 --> 00:45:50.523]  Here is Barbara Boxer yesterday.
[00:45:50.563 --> 00:45:54.286]  The good news is they're now having to talk about Bush being a dictator.
[00:45:54.586 --> 00:45:58.149]  You know, Drudge picked up the story that, oh, look, they're talking about impeachment.
[00:45:58.409 --> 00:45:59.530]  That's not the story here.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:02.381]  I mean, it's important, but it's an addendum.
[00:46:03.402 --> 00:46:05.263]  It's an added bonus.
[00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:09.545]  What's important here is everywhere people are talking about martial law now.
[00:46:09.866 --> 00:46:12.127]  Cindy Sheehan's talking about 9-11 inside job.
[00:46:12.487 --> 00:46:14.368]  She's talking about martial law, stage terror.
[00:46:14.929 --> 00:46:16.330]  Ron Paul's talking about it.
[00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:19.812]  You see, it's becoming mainline.
[00:46:21.633 --> 00:46:23.974]  And yes, folks, Cindy Sheehan is as mainline as it gets.
[00:46:24.054 --> 00:46:28.597]  I mean, she's got approval ratings of 40 plus percent in polls.
[00:46:29.244 --> 00:46:35.009]  She isn't at 12% like Shani, so don't give me your, oh she's not mainline, or Ron Paul isn't mainline.
[00:46:35.469 --> 00:46:36.430]  Let's go ahead and go to the tape.
[00:46:37.709 --> 00:46:40.471]  They want impeachment put back on the table.
[00:46:40.511 --> 00:46:43.252]  They want impeachment on the table as a bargaining chip.
[00:46:43.292 --> 00:46:46.694]  Because, for instance, the Scooter Libby commuting to the Senate.
[00:46:47.054 --> 00:46:53.478]  What happened today with Sarah Taylor saying that she's been instructed by the President not to say anything.
[00:46:53.798 --> 00:47:00.142]  Alberto Gonzales, the story about how he was briefed about the Patriot Act, then lied a week later in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[00:47:00.462 --> 00:47:02.063]  I mean, when is enough is enough?
[00:47:02.403 --> 00:47:04.124]  Yeah, I mean, you left out a bunch of things.
[00:47:04.764 --> 00:47:10.187]  Spying on citizens without a warrant, going around FISA on and on.
[00:47:10.567 --> 00:47:14.469]  Look, I have always said it should be on the table, and I've always said it.
[00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:17.970]  I mean, what I... It was such an interesting thing.
[00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:22.852]  I was on a book tour, and I ran into John Dean of Watergate fame.
[00:47:23.373 --> 00:47:32.117]  He was on the book tour that I was on for his book, and it was right after we discovered that the administration was spying on our people without a warrant.
[00:47:33.656 --> 00:47:42.839]  He just said, he looked at me and basically just said, as far as he could see, unless there was some explanation for this, this was impeachable.
[00:47:42.879 --> 00:47:53.122]  And I've always said that you need to keep it on the table and you need to look at these things because now people are dying because of this administration.
[00:47:54.043 --> 00:47:55.883]  You know, that's the truth.
[00:47:56.243 --> 00:47:57.844]  And they won't change course.
[00:47:58.413 --> 00:48:00.334]  They are ignoring the Congress.
[00:48:00.374 --> 00:48:05.276]  They keep signing these signing statements, which means that he's decided not to enforce the law.
[00:48:05.296 --> 00:48:08.878]  This is as close as we've ever come to a dictatorship.
[00:48:09.118 --> 00:48:15.722]  You know, when you have a situation where Congress is stepped on, that means the American people are stepped on.
[00:48:15.782 --> 00:48:18.483]  So I don't think that you can take anything off the table.
[00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:23.534]  Because, in fact, the Constitution doesn't permit us to take these things off the table.
[00:48:23.574 --> 00:48:31.961]  Would you counsel Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid to put it on the table and make a statement before everybody goes home in August?
[00:48:32.001 --> 00:48:35.184]  Because they're going to get an earful from the American people when they go home.
[00:48:35.564 --> 00:48:38.667]  Well, you know, I don't presume to tell people what to do.
[00:48:38.687 --> 00:48:40.229]  I have made my statement.
[00:48:40.329 --> 00:48:42.010]  And, of course, if asked, I will say.
[00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.431]  And I've been out there.
[00:48:43.451 --> 00:48:45.233]  I'm out here again today, I think.
[00:48:45.731 --> 00:48:49.113]  You know, John Conyers is, this is where impeachment starts.
[00:48:49.533 --> 00:48:54.295]  When, when Humberto Gonzales, when it came out that he, you know, fired these U.S.
[00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:58.517]  attorneys, that, you know, it was politics being played with it.
[00:48:58.777 --> 00:49:03.060]  I, I thought then we should look into impeachment hearings.
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:06.721]  So I don't think it should be taken... Now I want to make it clear.
[00:49:08.662 --> 00:49:09.423]  Crystal clear.
[00:49:10.563 --> 00:49:12.064]  There are no American people now.
[00:49:12.717 --> 00:49:15.599]  You see, we want to become American people again.
[00:49:15.619 --> 00:49:16.739]  We have to get the country back.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:20.241]  The banking system is run by offshore systems.
[00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:22.482]  They have overturned the Bill of Rights.
[00:49:22.502 --> 00:49:24.023]  They federalized your local police.
[00:49:24.883 --> 00:49:26.144]  They federalized everything.
[00:49:27.525 --> 00:49:35.289]  And now that last little veil of playland, of pretend like they have it, is disappearing.
[00:49:37.790 --> 00:49:40.872]  And when illegal aliens, when we got mayors on tape,
[00:49:42.393 --> 00:49:47.436]  In San Diego, going, Oh, well, you know, don't complain at me at the City Council.
[00:49:47.596 --> 00:49:50.217]  I mean, we tell the cops not to arrest you for DWIs.
[00:49:51.718 --> 00:50:01.343]  I mean, when the illegal aliens don't have to have IDs to have bank accounts or housing loans and can drive around drunk driving or do whatever they want, but citizens are shoved around by goon-like cops.
[00:50:02.103 --> 00:50:03.284]  I mean, you're not citizens.
[00:50:05.865 --> 00:50:07.006]  When you don't have those
[00:50:08.516 --> 00:50:08.916]  Rights?
[00:50:09.637 --> 00:50:10.557]  You're not a citizen.
[00:50:11.077 --> 00:50:12.998]  We're just some mining operation.
[00:50:13.018 --> 00:50:14.879]  We're like a mining pit or something.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.120]  That's what the globalist says.
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:18.181]  That's what globalism is.
[00:50:18.241 --> 00:50:19.101]  It's no more countries.
[00:50:19.481 --> 00:50:27.665]  It's big multinational corporations and banks running the governments and just sucking the countries dry and knocking down any protections of the nation.
[00:50:27.685 --> 00:50:31.067]  I mean, there's not much left of the country, is my point.
[00:50:32.247 --> 00:50:35.229]  And we're not going to get our sovereignty back until the illusion
[00:50:38.123 --> 00:50:38.563]  He's gone.
[00:50:39.724 --> 00:50:44.066]  All right, we'll get to many of your calls and a lot more news when we get back.
[00:50:45.787 --> 00:50:47.408]  It is Friday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:47.448 --> 00:50:48.829]  Big eugenics report coming up.
[00:50:48.909 --> 00:50:49.310]  Stay with us.
[00:51:02.288 --> 00:51:05.469]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:07.730]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:08.091 --> 00:51:15.734]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:23.503]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:23.883 --> 00:51:35.308]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:35.628 --> 00:51:39.089]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:41.530]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:41.850 --> 00:51:45.692]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:51:59.193 --> 00:52:02.374]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:02.394 --> 00:52:06.435]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:06.576 --> 00:52:09.136]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:09.196 --> 00:52:11.517]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:11.717 --> 00:52:20.140]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:21.541]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:52:21.681 --> 00:52:25.742]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:25.762 --> 00:52:26.403]  We're good to go!
[00:52:46.101 --> 00:52:49.125]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:52:49.145 --> 00:52:50.788]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.808 --> 00:52:51.769]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.788 --> 00:53:04.910]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:06.891]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:53:07.171 --> 00:53:13.455]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:53:13.735 --> 00:53:19.878]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:53:20.118 --> 00:53:21.959]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:53:22.219 --> 00:53:22.659]  I think so.
[00:53:44.814 --> 00:53:46.514]  Let's go to Paul in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:53:46.534 --> 00:53:47.235]  Thanks for holding, Paul.
[00:53:47.275 --> 00:53:48.075]  You're on the air.
[00:54:15.613 --> 00:54:17.915]  I just had a couple of historical questions, if I can.
[00:54:18.636 --> 00:54:19.277]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:54:20.658 --> 00:54:24.721]  One is about the Freemasons, like George Washington era.
[00:54:26.143 --> 00:54:33.569]  King George III, I think he had a few sons, and after he was defeated, apparently his sons turned to Freemasonry.
[00:54:33.589 --> 00:54:36.472]  Is that when it started to get infiltrated by British royalty?
[00:54:39.148 --> 00:54:41.229]  I think it was always infiltrated.
[00:54:41.249 --> 00:54:52.215]  I mean, to get into masonry, and I've probably read, I don't know, 15, 20 books on the subject, and I wouldn't even claim to be that much of an expert on it.
[00:54:52.235 --> 00:55:05.343]  I mean, really, masonry itself is just a secret vehicle for private networks and intelligence agencies themselves
[00:55:06.687 --> 00:55:13.629]  Which are so old, they have occultic trappings because they literally come out of antiquity to operate inside.
[00:55:13.729 --> 00:55:18.791]  So, that's like saying the FBI are all murdering killers.
[00:55:19.271 --> 00:55:19.791]  Well, no.
[00:55:19.811 --> 00:55:24.272]  A lot of them are out investigating bank robberies and, you know, crimes and murders.
[00:55:24.713 --> 00:55:29.554]  But at the top, they've been vetted, and yeah, they are extremely criminal.
[00:55:30.654 --> 00:55:32.255]  And history and the facts have shown that.
[00:55:33.374 --> 00:55:34.535]  It's the same thing with masons.
[00:55:34.595 --> 00:55:36.757]  I mean, George Washington was a good guy.
[00:55:37.217 --> 00:55:38.858]  George Washington was a very brave person.
[00:55:39.719 --> 00:55:41.360]  George Washington did amazing things.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:46.083]  And before he died, he criticized, you know, quote, black masonry.
[00:55:46.123 --> 00:55:47.224]  That doesn't mean black people, folks.
[00:55:47.244 --> 00:55:50.506]  You know, this dark form of masonry that was taking over.
[00:55:51.067 --> 00:55:55.090]  And really, that was just he got high enough level as, you know, president
[00:55:55.650 --> 00:55:57.090]  Do you see how that works?
[00:55:57.110 --> 00:55:57.951]  Right.
[00:55:57.991 --> 00:55:58.291]  Okay.
[00:56:23.819 --> 00:56:33.906]  Speaking of that, this is Friday the 13th when the Knights Templars all got whacked, and then, well, a bunch of them got whacked all over Europe and Spain and France and Germany, so they ran to Scotland.
[00:56:34.527 --> 00:56:35.927]  And then that became the headquarters.
[00:56:36.628 --> 00:56:39.170]  And then you could say they kind of took over in England from that point.
[00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.471]  Okay.
[00:56:41.351 --> 00:56:47.055]  My next question is, I've been reading up about the Titanic, and I saw that J.P.
[00:56:47.075 --> 00:56:48.336]  Morgan funded the entire thing.
[00:56:49.167 --> 00:56:49.407]  Yes.
[00:56:49.547 --> 00:56:54.929]  And some people said that... And the guy that did the investigation of it was a copy of Genesis, but sorry, go ahead.
[00:56:55.449 --> 00:57:02.971]  Okay, yeah, um, they said, uh, I read something, a lot of people who are opposed to the bankers, international bankers and Federal Reserve had died on that ship.
[00:57:03.791 --> 00:57:05.152]  And, and things like J.P.
[00:57:05.172 --> 00:57:08.213]  Morgan was scheduled to be on that ship, but he canceled at the last minute.
[00:57:09.233 --> 00:57:15.895]  Um, I mean, I know it's, it's almost 100 years ago, but is there a possibility that it wasn't an iceberg?
[00:57:17.216 --> 00:57:25.860]  Being funded by JP Morgan, all these anti-international bankers going down with the ship, and then the Federal Reserve gets set up a year later.
[00:57:26.861 --> 00:57:33.344]  It is true that a large portion of the British and U.S.
[00:57:33.504 --> 00:57:38.167]  elite, and a lot of it was the old line elite, did go down on that ship.
[00:57:38.267 --> 00:57:42.769]  It was an unbelievable concentration of elite, but I don't think the captain
[00:57:43.872 --> 00:57:51.455]  And his first mates who, by the way, died would go along with that to sacrifice those people.
[00:57:51.855 --> 00:57:54.297]  Then the question is, was there a big bomb in the ship or something?
[00:57:54.877 --> 00:57:55.437]  I don't know.
[00:57:55.497 --> 00:57:56.678]  There's not enough information.
[00:57:56.698 --> 00:57:59.059]  I have seen those theories.
[00:58:00.339 --> 00:58:03.240]  And it was, you know, almost a hundred years ago.
[00:58:03.901 --> 00:58:05.761]  So I really just don't go there.
[00:58:05.781 --> 00:58:07.782]  I mean, I stick to the things I can prove.
[00:58:07.802 --> 00:58:08.403]  Okay.
[00:58:08.723 --> 00:58:09.703]  And one more thing.
[00:58:10.023 --> 00:58:11.464]  You have that Tiananmen Memorial.
[00:58:12.276 --> 00:58:13.177]  A few weeks back.
[00:58:13.197 --> 00:58:22.761]  I don't know if you know this, but in China, in Chengdu, the city is, there was a newspaper that ran a tribute to the mothers of the people who died at Tiananmen.
[00:58:23.661 --> 00:58:27.523]  Either the same day or the next day, the editor was arrested at that newspaper.
[00:58:28.364 --> 00:58:28.844]  Oh yeah!
[00:58:28.904 --> 00:58:31.185]  No, no, there's active rebellion all over China.
[00:58:31.245 --> 00:58:34.066]  It's not free, like our media tells us now.
[00:58:34.446 --> 00:58:34.987]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:35.007 --> 00:58:35.747]  We'll be right back.

[00:58:55.393 --> 00:58:56.033]  Big Brother.
[00:58:56.694 --> 00:58:57.754]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:58.454 --> 00:58:59.615]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.235 --> 00:59:01.036]  You want answers?
[00:59:01.796 --> 00:59:02.677]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:02.697 --> 00:59:07.019]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.559 --> 00:59:11.661]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.843 --> 00:59:17.624]  We're already into hour number two.
[00:59:18.365 --> 00:59:20.946]  Darren Dykes is going to be in studio coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:29.642]  For the big report on Eugenics Part 3 from 1960 onward.
[00:59:32.243 --> 00:59:34.003]  We're taking your calls right now.
[00:59:34.503 --> 00:59:35.964]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[00:59:36.604 --> 00:59:38.524]  Let's talk to Jim in Michigan.
[00:59:38.564 --> 00:59:39.445]  Jim, thanks for holding.
[00:59:40.665 --> 00:59:42.206]  Well, thanks for having me on, Alex.
[00:59:42.286 --> 00:59:43.726]  I really appreciate it.
[00:59:45.166 --> 00:59:45.486]  You bet.
[00:59:45.527 --> 00:59:46.507]  I appreciate you calling, sir.
[00:59:46.547 --> 00:59:47.107]  What's on your mind?
[00:59:47.960 --> 01:00:00.449]  Well, I'd like to start with the fact that I was kind of turned on to government corruption and such in the mid to late 80s with a... Actually, it was a band called Queensryche.
[01:00:00.489 --> 01:00:02.971]  Had an album out called Operation Mindcrime.
[01:00:03.611 --> 01:00:05.092]  Yeah, that's really political.
[01:00:05.132 --> 01:00:12.277]  In fact, I remember about a year or two ago, I never really realized that they were playing a triple shot on a local radio station
[01:00:13.496 --> 01:00:17.959]  of Queensryche, and three songs in a row were just anti-New World Order.
[01:00:17.979 --> 01:00:18.619]  It blew me away.
[01:00:18.639 --> 01:00:19.220]  Exactly.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:24.163]  I was thinking something like Revolution Calling would be great bumper music for you.
[01:00:25.783 --> 01:00:28.305]  No, they certainly know what's going on, and they knew back in the 80s.
[01:00:28.885 --> 01:00:33.688]  Yeah, and I'm like, you know, these guys couldn't have come up with this stuff right off the top of their heads.
[01:00:33.708 --> 01:00:35.770]  There's got to be something underneath.
[01:00:36.290 --> 01:00:38.151]  So from there I started doing research.
[01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:41.413]  I read William Cooper's book, Behold a Pale Horse.
[01:00:44.048 --> 01:00:46.229]  And that just blew me away as well.
[01:00:46.289 --> 01:00:48.871]  Some of the stuff that's in that book is unbelievable.
[01:00:50.992 --> 01:00:52.273]  A lot of it is documented.
[01:00:53.234 --> 01:00:54.695]  And he's got it right in the book.
[01:00:57.496 --> 01:00:58.297]  Anything else, sir?
[01:00:59.097 --> 01:01:06.282]  Yeah, the Politics of Piercities, the shows that aired on BBC a while back, are really awesome.
[01:01:06.362 --> 01:01:11.565]  And, you know, from there I went, I found your show about a year ago and I've been listening to it.
[01:01:11.605 --> 01:01:13.446]  I've got the InfoWars stickers and
[01:01:14.275 --> 01:01:18.716]  9-11 was an inside job, stickers on my car.
[01:01:19.916 --> 01:01:21.236]  What type of response do you get?
[01:01:21.896 --> 01:01:29.038]  You know, it's kind of sometimes good, sometimes bad, sometimes indifferent.
[01:01:29.138 --> 01:01:29.778]  It all depends.
[01:01:29.798 --> 01:01:37.239]  Do you ever have like guys with big American flags made by Chinese slaves, like drive up beside you and give you a dirty look?
[01:01:37.899 --> 01:01:38.879]  My next door neighbor.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:41.780]  My next door neighbor.
[01:01:42.729 --> 01:01:48.292]  He saw that on my car and since then, I mean, he would come outside and he never speaks to me anymore.
[01:01:48.812 --> 01:01:50.473]  I'm like, Steve, what's going on?
[01:01:50.533 --> 01:01:51.154]  How are you doing?
[01:01:52.074 --> 01:01:59.218]  And, uh, he just, I noticed the bumper sticker on your car and I tried to explain things to him and he just kind of blew me off.
[01:01:59.258 --> 01:02:00.999]  So I figure, well, you know, it's your life.
[01:02:01.039 --> 01:02:02.079]  You can do what you want.
[01:02:02.239 --> 01:02:06.061]  So he said, I noticed the bumper sticker on your car.
[01:02:06.582 --> 01:02:06.842]  Yeah.
[01:02:07.552 --> 01:02:11.834]  Now imagine, see, Americans in the past would love to debate, love to argue.
[01:02:12.294 --> 01:02:14.795]  That man would respect your right to have that opinion.
[01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:17.736]  But see now, oh, I better not talk to him.
[01:02:18.036 --> 01:02:18.417]  You know why?
[01:02:18.437 --> 01:02:19.817]  Because he knows that's big medicine.
[01:02:20.217 --> 01:02:21.478]  He knows that's powerful.
[01:02:21.538 --> 01:02:22.859]  He knows deep down it's true.
[01:02:23.199 --> 01:02:23.919]  He's upset.
[01:02:23.939 --> 01:02:26.120]  Listen, I got some neighbors.
[01:02:27.105 --> 01:02:27.385]  Yeah.
[01:02:48.749 --> 01:02:49.209]  Exactly.
[01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:51.671]  I've gotten that reaction myself.
[01:02:52.212 --> 01:02:57.496]  I was in one of the local water... Look, look, they're like dumb Nazi followers, man.
[01:02:57.816 --> 01:03:01.779]  They're not going to know until their country's in ruins and they're bankrupt, okay?
[01:03:02.259 --> 01:03:05.622]  It's all going to come out later and they're going to be, Gee, we didn't know!
[01:03:06.062 --> 01:03:08.604]  Gee, we didn't... You know, because they don't know anything.
[01:03:09.064 --> 01:03:09.464]  Exactly.
[01:03:09.504 --> 01:03:13.367]  They think patriotism is mindlessly worshipping Bill O'Reilly, the pervert.
[01:03:14.068 --> 01:03:14.688]  Oh, geez.
[01:03:15.089 --> 01:03:16.870]  Don't even get me started on that guy.
[01:03:17.901 --> 01:03:19.462]  But it's just unbelievable.
[01:03:19.842 --> 01:03:24.964]  I'll be in town at one of the local watering holes, talking to people, trying to spread the word.
[01:03:25.664 --> 01:03:37.670]  And, you know, sometimes the reaction will be good, and I'll get them a copy of Terror Storm, or a copy of one of your other DVDs, and everything will go great.
[01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:43.813]  But one thing I would really like to know is... Stay there, I'll quickly finish up with you, then I'll get to everybody else.
[01:03:43.833 --> 01:03:46.794]  We'll go to David, Jonathan, Jeremiah, and many others.
[01:03:51.298 --> 01:03:56.263]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:03:56.564 --> 01:03:58.826]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[01:03:58.886 --> 01:04:06.334]  Our Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box, so it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:04:06.694 --> 01:04:09.697]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:04:10.017 --> 01:04:13.441]  So effective, you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:04:13.761 --> 01:04:23.104]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:04:23.364 --> 01:04:26.866]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:04:27.106 --> 01:04:34.228]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:04:34.488 --> 01:04:35.849]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[01:04:36.929 --> 01:04:39.770]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:04:50.518 --> 01:04:54.121]  It's here.
[01:04:54.322 --> 01:04:59.086]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:04:59.446 --> 01:05:07.053]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:07.768 --> 01:05:14.831]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:15.231 --> 01:05:26.656]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:30.638]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:30.918 --> 01:05:32.899]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:33.199 --> 01:05:37.041]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:05:37.641 --> 01:05:45.094]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:05:50.842 --> 01:05:52.563]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:05:52.723 --> 01:05:54.064]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:54.204 --> 01:05:57.046]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:05:57.406 --> 01:06:00.168]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:00.708 --> 01:06:07.452]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:07.992 --> 01:06:15.617]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.
[01:06:16.597 --> 01:06:20.280]  LibertyStickers.com can even customize your own bumper stickers.

[01:06:36.673 --> 01:06:36.853]  Call 877-873-9626.
[01:06:36.893 --> 01:06:37.173]  That's 877-873-9626.
[01:06:37.193 --> 01:06:38.933]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:38.953 --> 01:06:40.134]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:01.425 --> 01:07:12.669]  Coming up, we're going to play about six minutes of Aldous Huxley, a speech he gave shortly before his death in Berkeley, California, where he talks about the invisible government, the oligarchy, the New World Order.
[01:07:13.109 --> 01:07:26.014]  His book, Brave New World, of course, is written in 32, where they scientifically inject you with mercury and other chemicals to brain damage you when you're a baby.
[01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:29.357]  Where they radiate you as in the womb to control you.
[01:07:29.377 --> 01:07:32.317]  They have subclasses where the elite dumbs down.
[01:07:32.357 --> 01:07:38.859]  See, eugenics told the public they wanted to make the race better, which itself was misguided.
[01:07:39.499 --> 01:07:42.219]  But in reality, they want to create subspecies.
[01:07:42.259 --> 01:07:43.740]  And we have Bertrand Russell on record.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.520]  We literally have thousands of quotes.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:47.701]  Folks, we have so much evidence of what they're doing.
[01:07:48.921 --> 01:07:50.581]  Well, I just want to say, don't listen to me.
[01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:51.982]  Be sure and take your injections.
[01:07:52.042 --> 01:07:53.742]  They really want to help you.
[01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:55.831]  Let me just tell you that.
[01:07:56.112 --> 01:07:58.032]  Maybe I'll use reverse psychology on you.
[01:07:58.552 --> 01:08:03.154]  I mean, folks, learning what I've learned, again, I mean, I've said I don't know everything.
[01:08:04.574 --> 01:08:05.295]  I don't know much.
[01:08:06.455 --> 01:08:11.737]  And the more I learn, the more I realize the old saying's true, that the more I learn, the more I learn how much I don't know.
[01:08:13.297 --> 01:08:18.059]  But I knew about eugenics, and I knew they wanted to kill 80% of us, and I knew I had all these documents, and I knew
[01:08:19.503 --> 01:08:25.185]  But I didn't fully understand how big it was and how they're in every major power position.
[01:08:27.725 --> 01:08:34.887]  And, you know, because you still got that idea in the back of your head, okay, they say this and they do this, but they're not really meaning to do it.
[01:08:35.887 --> 01:08:38.948]  And then you just find out that it's just unlimited writings.
[01:08:39.428 --> 01:08:43.930]  I mean, I could find the documents and the quotes and the books, I think, as fast as they're writing them.
[01:08:44.490 --> 01:08:45.930]  So it's inexhaustible.
[01:08:46.330 --> 01:08:48.811]  You just, and it's just everywhere.
[01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:54.454]  I mean, we're just randomly surfing around the web last night and Aaron goes, what's that?
[01:08:54.474 --> 01:08:58.215]  And we click on some horrible famous eugenics quotes from Bertrand Russell.
[01:08:59.256 --> 01:09:07.978]  And then, you know, there's a video clip at the state of Texas saying that children have bad gene pools and must be put on drugs.
[01:09:08.058 --> 01:09:12.079]  I mean, it's just... Alright, I'm already getting off into it.
[01:09:12.559 --> 01:09:13.639]  It's actually blown me away.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:17.821]  Every time I think I can't be blown away, the New World Order just blows me away.
[01:09:17.901 --> 01:09:18.421]  I mean, they're just...
[01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:22.420]  The absolute spawn of hell.
[01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:28.523]  They are directly out of the depths of the blackest hole in Hades, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:29.063 --> 01:09:33.946]  These people eat, breathe, sleep, live to create misery.
[01:09:34.086 --> 01:09:36.068]  They love hurting you.
[01:09:36.748 --> 01:09:39.750]  They love hurting children especially.
[01:09:40.530 --> 01:09:43.492]  They are, and they just revel in it.
[01:09:46.019 --> 01:09:50.681]  And there's quotes like, Soon our scientific dictatorship will be in complete control.
[01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.542]  A revolt against the New World Order.
[01:09:54.322 --> 01:09:54.982]  I'm paraphrasing.
[01:09:55.022 --> 01:09:55.983]  I'll read it when Aaron gets in here.
[01:09:56.003 --> 01:09:56.943]  I don't have the quote in front of me.
[01:09:56.963 --> 01:09:57.623]  I haven't printed it off.
[01:10:00.344 --> 01:10:01.945]  This is like one in the morning we're reading this.
[01:10:03.285 --> 01:10:07.367]  Soon the scientific dictatorship of the New World Order will be invincible.
[01:10:08.307 --> 01:10:13.409]  A revolt by the population, by the plebiscites, will
[01:10:15.908 --> 01:10:22.532]  Be the same threat as sheep revolting against humans for the consumption of mutton.
[01:10:22.892 --> 01:10:23.812]  Mutton's sheep.
[01:10:27.014 --> 01:10:27.935]  Baby sheep, isn't it?
[01:10:28.035 --> 01:10:28.655]  Juvenile sheep?
[01:10:32.717 --> 01:10:35.139]  In other words, you people are like farm animals.
[01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:37.220]  There's nothing you can do!
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:44.644]  That's from a Nobel Prize winner, literally, you know, globalist, writing the book on it all, and I mean, it's just...
[01:10:45.330 --> 01:10:49.472]  And you just find out, and meanwhile they prance around, you know, all these people are Time 100.
[01:10:51.854 --> 01:10:54.856]  Russell, Sanger, Hitler, it doesn't matter.
[01:10:55.776 --> 01:11:02.380]  But a lot of them, they just say, oh, loving, liberal, helping children, helping blacks.
[01:11:03.453 --> 01:11:07.815]  And you read, you know, them, I'm gonna get the blacks and the weeds, I can't wait to tell them!
[01:11:07.835 --> 01:11:12.236]  And then they're on Time Magazine, oh, so loving, oh!
[01:11:12.756 --> 01:11:16.317]  I mean, folks, do you have any idea how out of control it is?
[01:11:16.538 --> 01:11:17.498]  How over the top?
[01:11:17.538 --> 01:11:18.218]  No, I guess you don't.
[01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:19.679]  I guess I don't either.
[01:11:19.759 --> 01:11:29.322]  It's just, it's so... I mean, to have them calling a sheep and saying that it's like sheep revolting against their owners for the eating of mutton.
[01:11:33.502 --> 01:11:35.824]  Hey Aaron, I see you walking around out there in case you're not listening.
[01:11:36.544 --> 01:11:37.545]  Get that Bertrand Russell.
[01:11:37.585 --> 01:11:38.305]  I think it's in the printer.
[01:11:38.325 --> 01:11:39.166]  I think it's in your printer.
[01:11:39.186 --> 01:11:39.846]  I think I printed it.
[01:11:40.406 --> 01:11:41.127]  Oh, headache.
[01:11:42.027 --> 01:11:43.709]  Can't wait till endgame's done, folks.
[01:11:43.789 --> 01:11:45.950]  I am kind of frazzled.
[01:11:46.050 --> 01:11:49.772]  I just say this so you know why I sound a little different lately.
[01:11:49.792 --> 01:11:53.695]  You know, I get home at three in the morning and then, you know, get up at seven.
[01:11:54.675 --> 01:11:56.857]  You don't really sleep right and you do it day after day.
[01:11:56.877 --> 01:11:57.998]  You just start getting, you know.
[01:11:58.638 --> 01:11:59.519]  I actually feel good.
[01:11:59.559 --> 01:12:00.159]  I just feel kind of
[01:12:01.846 --> 01:12:06.889]  Yeah, my last question was, I've got a friend, my best friend in the world, I'd do anything for him, but he's a dyed-in-the-wool, hardcore conservative.
[01:12:32.148 --> 01:12:34.289]  And he says, OK, OK, you tell me all this stuff.
[01:12:34.710 --> 01:12:36.691]  You say you're trying to open my eyes to it.
[01:12:37.031 --> 01:12:39.713]  You say Bush is a puppet and all this other stuff.
[01:12:40.453 --> 01:12:41.334]  Who runs Bush?
[01:12:42.475 --> 01:12:44.676]  And I was at a loss for words.
[01:12:45.437 --> 01:12:46.577]  I didn't know where to go with it.
[01:12:47.198 --> 01:12:47.978]  Who runs Bush?
[01:12:49.599 --> 01:12:51.200]  Well, I mean, have you ever studied history?
[01:12:52.281 --> 01:12:52.521]  Yeah.
[01:12:54.262 --> 01:12:59.206]  Well, I mean, even Julius Caesar was controlled by about an anvil of less than 10 men.
[01:13:00.347 --> 01:13:07.929]  Who owned all the major sectors of the Roman economy and the largest lands, and had the most slaves on their vineyards and properties.
[01:13:09.329 --> 01:13:12.510]  And it's special interest, it's games.
[01:13:12.550 --> 01:13:15.291]  Explain to him, ask him if he's ever seen The Godfather.
[01:13:16.011 --> 01:13:16.231]  Right.
[01:13:16.571 --> 01:13:23.273]  Based on, the names are changed, but only slightly, from real stories and stuff that came out in Lacosa Nostra hearings.
[01:13:24.412 --> 01:13:27.754]  You know, it all started when they busted that farmhouse having a mafia meeting.
[01:13:28.094 --> 01:13:39.501]  That was only one small sector of global mafia, but the Italians had become very powerful and were starting to even vie against the WASP and Jewish mafia, which are inseparable, you can't even, it's the same group.
[01:13:40.521 --> 01:13:43.543]  I mean, people said, well, it's this group or that group, they're all intermarried, it's the same people.
[01:13:45.024 --> 01:13:50.107]  And they tried to come in and push them out, and it was like, uh-uh, we're telling people you exist, and we're burning you.
[01:13:50.874 --> 01:13:51.355]  And they did.
[01:13:51.755 --> 01:13:53.376]  And I mean, now they're just low-level street thugs.
[01:13:53.396 --> 01:13:54.697]  You know, the Italian Mafia is nothing.
[01:13:54.978 --> 01:13:57.900]  Or any of the real families, you know, went into, quote, legitimate business.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.421]  They own the banks that launder the drug money.
[01:13:59.681 --> 01:14:00.922]  They don't actually ship the drugs in.
[01:14:02.043 --> 01:14:04.405]  So, that's the way you explain it to them.
[01:14:04.586 --> 01:14:08.949]  You know that scene in The Godfather 1, where there's like 15 guys around the table?
[01:14:09.550 --> 01:14:15.815]  The boss is from all the main cities, but then there's the one boss, who's from the most powerful family?
[01:14:16.996 --> 01:14:18.357]  And he basically calls the shots?
[01:14:18.417 --> 01:14:21.138]  Well, okay, globally there's about a hundred of them.
[01:14:21.539 --> 01:14:24.260]  And they go to the Bilderberg Group, and they actually hold court.
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:29.583]  And I mean, there's queens and kings and Rothschilds and Rockefellers there, and they get down.
[01:14:29.743 --> 01:14:31.204]  They set the policy for the next year.
[01:14:32.364 --> 01:14:39.308]  And they'll have 25 conciliaries, 25 jumping jacks there, who are basically imperial legates.
[01:14:40.251 --> 01:14:40.471]  No, I don't.
[01:14:59.248 --> 01:15:10.337]  Uh, Emperor's Leggats, and there'd generally only be one of them, they were usually a really old, trusted man who wasn't on a big power trip anymore, but had been in major seats of power, and then the Leggats would be dispatched to speak for the Emperor.
[01:15:10.357 --> 01:15:14.060]  You know, they'd hold their arms up and say, I'm gonna lay it out to you.
[01:15:14.601 --> 01:15:14.901]  Okay?
[01:15:15.141 --> 01:15:18.003]  There are 25 Imperial Leggats, on average.
[01:15:18.384 --> 01:15:22.006]  There are 25 Imperial Leggats, there are 100 global owners, okay?
[01:15:22.307 --> 01:15:23.308]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:15:23.688 --> 01:15:24.709]  That's how it works, okay?
[01:15:25.549 --> 01:15:27.551]  George Bush runs absolutely nothing.
[01:15:29.190 --> 01:15:30.111]  Yes, I'm calling today.
[01:15:55.548 --> 01:16:00.031]  I got a bullhorn the other day from a local tool shop.
[01:16:02.513 --> 01:16:06.135]  Any advice you could give me towards what I need to do?
[01:16:06.155 --> 01:16:10.358]  Do I need to be in a group of some sort to be able to use it?
[01:16:10.378 --> 01:16:12.920]  Because I kind of don't want to be all alone.
[01:16:13.687 --> 01:16:20.837]  Okay, you lawfully, in a major public place, around a courthouse or government building, can use a bullhorn.
[01:16:20.857 --> 01:16:23.621]  You don't want to do it in neighborhoods where they can claim a noise ordinance.
[01:16:24.102 --> 01:16:26.165]  But really, if you have your shoulders down,
[01:16:27.445 --> 01:16:32.607]  And if you are acting insecure, they will come over and arrest you.
[01:16:32.907 --> 01:16:37.249]  There'll be no law by the time they slam your face in the concrete, they'll claim that was an assault on them.
[01:16:37.269 --> 01:16:38.349]  Doesn't matter if it's video of it.
[01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:46.653]  They'll assault you, kick you severely in the stomach, billy club you to the head, slam your face, drag it up and down the concrete, and then they will say that was an assault on them.
[01:16:46.973 --> 01:16:49.094]  Publicly, on video.
[01:16:49.114 --> 01:16:49.694]  That's the new freedom.
[01:16:50.475 --> 01:16:53.478]  Of course, that's a very small chance that would happen to you, but you have to know that is a factor.
[01:16:53.919 --> 01:16:55.261]  You're just calm, but direct.
[01:16:55.661 --> 01:16:56.222]  It's my right.
[01:16:56.262 --> 01:16:56.802]  First Amendment.
[01:16:56.842 --> 01:16:57.383]  I'm out here.
[01:16:57.704 --> 01:16:59.566]  This is not a march or demonstration.
[01:16:59.586 --> 01:17:00.547]  This is my free speech.
[01:17:00.947 --> 01:17:08.537]  See, they use semantical games, like, under the new New York film rule, for commercial Hollywood filming, you've got to have a permanent insurance.
[01:17:09.136 --> 01:17:15.399]  Well, being a news camera out there or a demonstration or someone engaging in free speech, you aren't under that.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:20.742]  Well, it's the same thing with these March permits and the rest of it, which have all been thrown out of court, but they're still trying.
[01:17:21.143 --> 01:17:22.603]  I have cops show up and say, we're going to arrest you.
[01:17:22.623 --> 01:17:24.044]  I go, go ahead, I'm going to sue you personally.
[01:17:24.304 --> 01:17:27.546]  And by the way, you'll probably beat it, officer, but I'm still going to sue you personally.
[01:17:27.566 --> 01:17:28.367]  You're going to have to hire a lawyer.
[01:17:28.967 --> 01:17:35.691]  So, you can either do the right thing and leave my First Amendment alone and stop attacking America, or you can do what you have to.
[01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:36.251]  Now, go ahead.
[01:17:37.377 --> 01:17:39.720]  And in every case, they've gotten religion.
[01:17:40.801 --> 01:17:44.864]  And because it's, again, it's like running over a deer in the road.
[01:17:45.645 --> 01:17:48.527]  They're bigger, they're more powerful, they've got more power behind them.
[01:17:49.188 --> 01:17:51.710]  But, just like I do in my car driving down the highway.
[01:17:52.191 --> 01:17:54.653]  And they're going to win a fight running over me.
[01:17:55.197 --> 01:17:57.040]  But do they want to dent up their car?
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:17:59.684]  Do they want to splatter my blood all over them?
[01:18:00.024 --> 01:18:10.079]  You see, when somebody's ready to go to jail, when somebody's ready to be tasered, when somebody's ready and confident, it isn't the image of confidence, it is true confidence,
[01:18:11.079 --> 01:18:18.841]  Then, these guys all operate off fear pheromones, because in their own system, it's all basically shimmy and chimpanzee psychology.
[01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:20.181]  I don't say that as an insult.
[01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:21.521]  That's how most humans operate.
[01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:25.822]  In the same, go to the king, ape, kneel before, touch the hand.
[01:18:25.842 --> 01:18:27.823]  They do that with each other.
[01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:32.143]  The lower level ones are subservient to the higher ups, and it goes up the chain.
[01:18:32.604 --> 01:18:34.544]  And so, you let them know, I'm in command.
[01:18:35.064 --> 01:18:35.465]  Okay?
[01:18:35.905 --> 01:18:36.706]  I'm in command.
[01:18:37.087 --> 01:18:38.228]  I'm not breaking any laws.
[01:18:38.568 --> 01:18:41.251]  You are trying to break a law by trying to violate my rights.
[01:18:41.572 --> 01:18:42.593]  Now, you've been warned.
[01:18:42.973 --> 01:18:43.514]  Back off!
[01:18:44.154 --> 01:18:44.495]  Okay?
[01:18:45.196 --> 01:18:47.138]  And I'd get with a few friends and do it on your first time.
[01:18:51.263 --> 01:18:55.868]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:18:56.068 --> 01:19:00.512]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.

[01:19:38.118 --> 01:19:39.359]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[01:19:39.539 --> 01:19:40.800]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:19:43.641 --> 01:19:45.106]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:45.147 --> 01:19:46.391]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:50.825 --> 01:19:51.285]  Gold.
[01:19:51.606 --> 01:19:52.887]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:59.251]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:19:59.431 --> 01:20:03.254]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:03.614 --> 01:20:05.495]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:20:05.555 --> 01:20:07.837]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:20:07.977 --> 01:20:15.162]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[01:20:15.162 --> 01:20:16.002]  We're good to go.
[01:20:38.370 --> 01:20:39.391]  By calling 800-686-2237.
[01:20:41.612 --> 01:20:45.754]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.575]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.256 --> 01:20:55.379]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegels, a Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis After Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[01:20:55.739 --> 01:21:03.983]  Develop the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[01:21:04.063 --> 01:21:05.384]  Defense tabs block virus
[01:21:05.384 --> 01:21:06.004]  We're good to go!
[01:21:30.811 --> 01:21:31.031]  I think so.
[01:21:50.362 --> 01:21:53.085]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[01:21:53.525 --> 01:21:55.808]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[01:21:56.108 --> 01:21:59.191]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[01:21:59.672 --> 01:22:01.834]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[01:22:01.994 --> 01:22:03.375]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[01:22:03.656 --> 01:22:07.760]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:11.223]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[01:22:11.524 --> 01:22:12.745]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[01:22:13.966 --> 01:22:22.233]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[01:22:22.594 --> 01:22:25.296]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[01:22:25.656 --> 01:22:32.983]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[01:22:33.343 --> 01:22:38.887]  To order Live52 and for the best source of research herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[01:22:38.907 --> 01:22:41.148]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:22:41.168 --> 01:22:45.031]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:01.733 --> 01:23:08.475]  We're only about 10 minutes away from Aaron Dykes in the studio with Part 3, the final part of the eugenics analysis.
[01:23:10.415 --> 01:23:13.616]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeremiah in Ohio.
[01:23:13.656 --> 01:23:14.836]  You're on the air, Jeremiah.
[01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.097]  I got an interesting message.
[01:23:17.157 --> 01:23:19.538]  I got from the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[01:23:19.978 --> 01:23:22.638]  She left a message on our answering machine.
[01:23:22.658 --> 01:23:23.338]  Would you like to hear it?
[01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:27.620]  You mean one of those automated messages they send out millions of?
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.220]  What is she talking about?
[01:23:29.998 --> 01:23:32.799]  I'm saying to vote for me, I would change history.
[01:23:32.819 --> 01:23:33.679]  Would you like to hear it?
[01:23:34.739 --> 01:23:35.559]  No, that's okay.
[01:23:35.919 --> 01:23:41.360]  I'm sure she already tried to change history with total socialized health care and blowing up federal buildings.
[01:23:42.341 --> 01:23:46.101]  I mean, why do you think there's something we really need to hear here?
[01:23:46.121 --> 01:23:49.702]  This sounds like straight out of 1984.
[01:23:49.802 --> 01:23:51.102]  For real, it does.
[01:23:51.543 --> 01:23:52.883]  Well, let me hear a little bit of it.
[01:23:53.183 --> 01:23:56.904]  And if the audio comes across well, if it telegraphs well, we'll play all of it.
[01:23:57.044 --> 01:23:57.324]  Go ahead.
[01:24:01.434 --> 01:24:06.858]  You see, I don't mind people doing this, but it never works well.
[01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:09.180]  Yeah, we're not going to do it.
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:10.701]  Listen, thanks for the call, my friend.
[01:24:10.721 --> 01:24:19.167]  I mean, people all the time want to call them with messages or video clips off TV, and it just... Who's up next?
[01:24:21.809 --> 01:24:23.330]  Mike in Kansas, you're on the air.
[01:24:23.390 --> 01:24:23.831]  Go ahead.
[01:24:24.831 --> 01:24:25.392]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:26.553 --> 01:24:29.014]  I'm kind of in a pickle and I was wondering if you could help me.
[01:24:30.126 --> 01:24:32.568]  I ran into something I really don't know how to handle.
[01:24:32.688 --> 01:24:34.870]  It seems like a vital piece of the puzzle.
[01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:37.913]  Well, let me see if I can, with my limited intellect, help you.
[01:24:37.953 --> 01:24:38.314]  Go ahead.
[01:24:39.475 --> 01:24:44.659]  Alright, well this is kind of far out, and the problem is there's not a whole lot of documentation out on that.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:47.402]  Okay, well just put it in a nutshell for me, sir.
[01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:55.929]  Alright, you remember how Aaron Russo said that Nick Rockefeller told him that
[01:24:57.168 --> 01:25:01.631]  That one of their goals was to have a microchipped society.
[01:25:02.912 --> 01:25:04.894]  Yes, you said that Nick Rockefeller told him that.
[01:25:05.414 --> 01:25:14.421]  Right, and then you had, uh, uh, Winthrop Rockefeller was the governor of Arkansas from 67 to 71, by the way.
[01:25:14.601 --> 01:25:25.149]  But anyways, I ran into some people, uh, that appear to be in some sort of a black ops deal or something, uh, back in the 70s, uh,
[01:25:27.046 --> 01:25:38.610]  ABC News stumbled onto what appears to me to have all the hallmarks of a black operation when they interviewed some people who had went to a land development in Arkansas.
[01:25:39.311 --> 01:25:40.451]  Where was Arkansas?
[01:25:41.632 --> 01:25:51.135]  Arkansas is a nest of money laundering, drug dealing, every form of corruption per square foot after Manhattan or L.A.
[01:25:51.255 --> 01:25:51.896]  or Miami.
[01:25:51.956 --> 01:25:55.517]  I mean Arkansas is in the top five most corrupt places on the planet.
[01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.261]  I agree with you.
[01:25:58.461 --> 01:26:05.162]  And of course, it's good, friendly Christian Baptists who all want to stay in their little prayer closets and ignore what's going on.
[01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:06.903]  It's a perfect place to run your evil op.
[01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.444]  Well, here's what happened.
[01:26:09.844 --> 01:26:17.506]  These people that ABC News was interviewing claimed they went to this land development and they had signed some papers that they hadn't read.
[01:26:17.966 --> 01:26:25.608]  Anyway, they also claimed on this show that after they signed those papers that they hadn't read,
[01:26:27.451 --> 01:26:34.895]  There's all sorts of scams going on.
[01:26:34.915 --> 01:26:38.397]  The Clintons ran all sorts of land scams.
[01:26:38.477 --> 01:26:39.818]  Whitewater, all the rest of it.
[01:26:41.379 --> 01:26:43.660]  Madison Guaranteed Savings, I mean all of that.
[01:26:45.221 --> 01:26:47.042]  Hubbell and the rest of them.
[01:26:47.362 --> 01:26:48.243]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:49.801 --> 01:26:56.687]  People call in all the time and they go, you're going to be amazed by this, and then it's just mainline stuff that we know has been going on for a long time.
[01:26:56.707 --> 01:27:15.684]  But when you talk about black ops, true black ops, FBI black ops, CIA black ops, have been running all sorts of scams out of Arkansas that we've run into for raising money, fake stock deals, you name it, that have been going on all over the place.
[01:27:20.262 --> 01:27:28.981]  I mean Arkansas is just a really dangerous place because you got a lot of really poor people who just want to go to church and work in the factory and keep their mouth shut.
[01:27:29.767 --> 01:27:34.391]  And then you've got really centralized wealth and a few families that are running on the state.
[01:27:34.751 --> 01:27:36.433]  And they invite in the mafia and the elites.
[01:27:36.493 --> 01:27:39.515]  I mean, Arkansas going back to, you know, 1910, 1920s.
[01:27:39.675 --> 01:27:42.818]  Al Capone would come down from Chicago.
[01:27:43.418 --> 01:27:45.780]  They would have big mafia meetings there out of New York.
[01:27:46.301 --> 01:27:47.382]  The horse racing there.
[01:27:48.222 --> 01:27:49.203]  Of course, that's admitted in the town.
[01:27:49.223 --> 01:27:51.825]  There's all the photos of all the gangsters at the horse track.
[01:27:52.486 --> 01:27:53.807]  And that was the big party place.
[01:27:55.007 --> 01:27:58.649]  And the prostitution is big in Little Rock and in Hot Springs.
[01:27:59.049 --> 01:28:00.149]  Hot Springs is really bad.
[01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:02.730]  Beautiful place, by the way.
[01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:06.372]  Growing up, my parents vacationed there a few times and took me along.
[01:28:07.733 --> 01:28:09.493]  They've got the mineral baths.
[01:28:11.474 --> 01:28:18.157]  Right there at the hotels, you'll have the swimming pool and a natural jacuzzi with the hot water coming right out of the ground, the spring water.
[01:28:21.585 --> 01:28:22.406]  It's like Mexico.
[01:28:22.426 --> 01:28:24.266]  The richest man in the world now is from Mexico.
[01:28:24.286 --> 01:28:25.107]  He's no longer Bill Gates.
[01:28:25.127 --> 01:28:28.509]  And of course, that's just the nouveau riche, the new rich.
[01:28:29.289 --> 01:28:30.930]  Their profits are still public.
[01:28:31.730 --> 01:28:32.951]  Gates and these guys are nothing.
[01:28:33.631 --> 01:28:36.253]  But at least the publicly richest man in the world is now Mexican.
[01:28:36.753 --> 01:28:38.974]  And they are the richest country per capita in the world.
[01:28:41.455 --> 01:28:42.356]  We're on the march.
[01:28:42.836 --> 01:28:44.437]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.357 --> 01:28:48.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.721 --> 01:28:52.141]  Attention!
[01:28:52.261 --> 01:28:55.062]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:28:55.362 --> 01:28:59.662]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:28:59.982 --> 01:29:00.663]  Listen closely.
[01:29:00.683 --> 01:29:08.784]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:29:09.084 --> 01:29:17.825]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:29:18.165 --> 01:29:21.086]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[01:29:21.326 --> 01:29:23.667]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:29:23.947 --> 01:29:33.410]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:29:33.610 --> 01:29:39.232]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:39.432 --> 01:29:42.994]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:29:43.234 --> 01:29:46.575]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[01:29:51.764 --> 01:29:54.305]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:54.945 --> 01:30:01.607]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:30:02.768 --> 01:30:05.049]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:30:05.869 --> 01:30:12.091]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:21.074]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:30:22.108 --> 01:30:29.992]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:30:32.774 --> 01:30:33.254]  Call now.

[01:30:51.377 --> 01:30:55.641]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:30:55.901 --> 01:31:00.746]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:00.986 --> 01:31:02.347]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:02.507 --> 01:31:05.870]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?

[01:31:17.641 --> 01:31:20.103]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:31:20.143 --> 01:31:22.465]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[01:31:26.289 --> 01:31:27.230]  No animal testing.
[01:31:27.490 --> 01:31:28.811]  I use them and love them.
[01:31:28.831 --> 01:31:30.433]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:31:30.713 --> 01:31:31.834]  And I say it big time.
[01:31:32.114 --> 01:31:33.715]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:33.836 --> 01:31:34.176]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[01:31:47.365 --> 01:31:53.306]  Look out your window, baby, and see your light's a catch.
[01:31:54.127 --> 01:32:02.128]  Bandit playing dixie, man got his hand out to catch.
[01:32:15.587 --> 01:32:15.807]  John.
[01:32:49.874 --> 01:33:00.081]  Well, first he's in the background, and then he's in the front.
[01:33:00.141 --> 01:33:06.185]  Both eyes are looking like they're on a rabbit hunt.
[01:33:06.205 --> 01:33:12.470]  Nobody says cheese to him, not even the chief of police.
[01:33:25.399 --> 01:33:30.520]  That's right, sometimes Satan looks fair, but can't you feel how foul?
[01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:36.741]  You know, the devil had a brand.
[01:33:36.761 --> 01:33:39.562]  Let's say Twinkies.
[01:33:40.862 --> 01:33:41.422]  Cupcakes.
[01:33:42.623 --> 01:33:44.383]  You wouldn't be a devil on the cover.
[01:33:44.403 --> 01:33:45.583]  You'd be a little angel.
[01:33:46.664 --> 01:33:48.244]  But you gotta realize, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:33:49.543 --> 01:33:59.548]  Alright, Aaron Dykes has done two different reports here on air with us in the last week and a half concerning eugenics.
[01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:13.234]  And just a recap for audiences out there that are watching this later at PrisonPlanet.tv on the web, who might not have seen the first two parts, or for listeners that might not have heard the first two parts, I'm making a film called Endgame.
[01:34:13.254 --> 01:34:15.155]  We're going to have it done in just a couple weeks.
[01:34:16.454 --> 01:34:23.418]  Then it'll take a month or so to get it mastered and then mass produced so we can sell it and get it out to you and put it on the web.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:31.283]  In the process, I meant to end the film with eugenics because I knew eugenics was a guiding force.
[01:34:31.343 --> 01:34:33.464]  I knew that a lot of top New World Order people were eugenicists.
[01:34:33.884 --> 01:34:35.945]  I knew the Bilderberg Group was founded by a eugenicist.
[01:34:36.586 --> 01:34:40.628]  I knew that computers were invented by eugenicists for eugenicists.
[01:34:41.366 --> 01:34:42.266]  I knew that H.G.
[01:34:42.306 --> 01:34:44.287]  Wells was a eugenicist, the Queen of England was.
[01:34:44.627 --> 01:34:51.490]  I mean, I knew that it was important and powerful and a guiding force, one of the main guiding pillars or supporting systems.
[01:34:52.351 --> 01:35:03.235]  I have to say it's THE pillar and THE guiding force and they're still operating, they have more power than ever, they control every major scientific discipline.
[01:35:05.556 --> 01:35:07.417]  It is basically the elite religion
[01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:17.877]  And in part one and two, we went from back in the 1840s when it first developed out of Darwin's theory of evolution of the species.
[01:35:18.778 --> 01:35:22.081]  And we're not saying he was a eugenicist, but later his children and grandchildren were.
[01:35:22.101 --> 01:35:31.489]  The point is that got seized on because it already made sense to the elite who were already into breeding, had already instinctively witnessed breeding with animals and plants and hybridization.
[01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:39.573]  But actually, they didn't like hybridization, they liked purification in their eyes, which actually, now with science, you know, actually causes problems, the opposite.
[01:35:40.573 --> 01:35:59.001]  But then by 1950 or so, eugenics just becomes more of an attitude of killing people is good, world population reduction is good, reducing the numbers of the useful idiots, or the useless feeders, depending on which term they used, or the eaters.
[01:36:01.619 --> 01:36:14.658]  And so many of the famous people we read about, like Margaret Sanger and others, you know, writing letters to the heir of Ivory Soap, Mr. Gamble.
[01:36:15.299 --> 01:36:27.568]  Later, a Procter & Gamble saying, we need to get rid of these black weeds, we need to recruit black leaders who will help us, because blacks don't trust us, because they're going to get wise of the fact that we want to exterminate them.
[01:36:27.588 --> 01:36:30.090]  I mean, we have literally hundreds of quotes like that.
[01:36:30.110 --> 01:36:31.391]  I mean, these are published.
[01:36:31.431 --> 01:36:32.592]  These are not our opinions.
[01:36:33.553 --> 01:36:35.294]  This is in their university papers.
[01:36:35.734 --> 01:36:38.176]  This is in the stuff that they gave the university after they died.
[01:36:39.037 --> 01:36:40.158]  And this stuff is all available.
[01:36:43.095 --> 01:36:46.841]  The Nazis coming over here after World War II weren't bringing eugenics here.
[01:36:47.262 --> 01:36:49.004]  The eugenics came from England and the U.S.
[01:36:49.345 --> 01:36:50.407]  They were just coming home.
[01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:53.191]  They were coming to the Mecca.
[01:36:54.513 --> 01:36:56.316]  And they fit in like a hand and glove.
[01:36:57.225 --> 01:37:01.209]  And it wasn't just Nazis over rocketry, it was Nazis over genetics.
[01:37:01.349 --> 01:37:10.880]  And you know, then you learn the head of the Cold Springs Harbor, the eugenics records office after World War II, becomes the discoverer of DNA and Nobel Prize winner in the 50s.
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:13.643]  Well, he won in the 63, discovered it in the mid-50s.
[01:37:14.584 --> 01:37:15.304]  That's Watson.
[01:37:16.225 --> 01:37:17.587]  And he's still alive today.
[01:37:18.676 --> 01:37:24.278]  And, you know, open eugenics pushing, but then saying it isn't eugenics, but then you read what he says, it's the same thing.
[01:37:24.498 --> 01:37:26.678]  You find that IBM started the Human Genome Project.
[01:37:26.718 --> 01:37:32.500]  They didn't just fund the Nazis and give them the punch card computers, and that's what the tattoo numbers were entered into.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:36.341]  You learn that then they did it in race studies here in the U.S.
[01:37:36.361 --> 01:37:38.582]  in the 20s, and in Jamaica in 28.
[01:37:39.782 --> 01:37:41.563]  You learn that folks, they literally
[01:37:42.714 --> 01:37:45.076]  Every time, I go, let's just randomly spot check this person.
[01:37:45.336 --> 01:37:48.478]  Let's spot check the head of this agency, and it'll be a top eugenicist.
[01:37:48.819 --> 01:37:50.580]  Let's spot check the head of that agency.
[01:37:51.461 --> 01:38:08.133]  And then we have news articles from just the last few years here in Texas where the New Freedom Initiative, where they want to drug half the children, the government says, the government says, they come out and
[01:38:11.388 --> 01:38:12.529]  Oh, it's just, I forgot what I said.
[01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.889]  When you coughed there.
[01:38:13.909 --> 01:38:15.030]  Not that you coughed.
[01:38:15.090 --> 01:38:16.491]  It's not bad that you coughed there.
[01:38:16.611 --> 01:38:18.031]  I just lost my train of thought.
[01:38:18.052 --> 01:38:18.812]  I haven't had any sleep.
[01:38:20.073 --> 01:38:21.193]  What was I getting into just now?
[01:38:23.855 --> 01:38:24.235]  We don't know?
[01:38:25.615 --> 01:38:26.576]  General Eugenics.
[01:38:26.596 --> 01:38:27.997]  I mean... It doesn't even matter anymore.
[01:38:28.017 --> 01:38:29.077]  I don't even know why the hell we're here.
[01:38:29.718 --> 01:38:30.458]  These people don't care.
[01:38:30.498 --> 01:38:31.038]  They don't listen.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:38.122]  Let's just play this old as Huxley tape.
[01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:46.280]  Why don't you describe what people are about to hear with this Aldous Huxley audio, where it came from, some of the points he made.
[01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:49.521]  Of course, it's a 45-minute speech with 30-40 minutes of questions.
[01:38:49.841 --> 01:38:50.822]  We can't play all that.
[01:38:51.222 --> 01:38:56.364]  Back in 2000, I did play the entire speech and questions when I was doing a nighttime radio show here on the network.
[01:38:56.944 --> 01:39:01.706]  But just go ahead, Aaron, walk us through this Huxley clip as an introduction, then we'll get into all the meat and potatoes.
[01:39:02.262 --> 01:39:20.476]  This is Aldous Huxley, of course, the author of Brave New World, and he's discussing mind control and society control, not in terms of would you do something on humanitarian grounds, not in terms of is there a scientific dictatorship, but what kind will we have?
[01:39:20.856 --> 01:39:23.078]  Will it be Brave New World or 1984?
[01:39:23.579 --> 01:39:29.183]  And he ultimately argues for his own vision, because, as you'll see, he says it's more economical.
[01:39:30.154 --> 01:39:41.528]  And you know he thinks systematic control coercion will work better than what he refers to as terrorism, which of course is just a matter of fact in the 1984 world.
[01:39:42.469 --> 01:39:43.370]  Pretty chilling stuff.
[01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:44.471]  Mind control.
[01:39:44.731 --> 01:39:49.297]  So we're going to go ahead and play this clip from 1962 by Aldous Huxley, his brother.
[01:39:49.989 --> 01:39:55.334]  was the founder of the World Wildlife Fund, with the top Nazi, Prince Bernhard, founder of the Bilderberg Group.
[01:39:55.354 --> 01:39:56.595]  Again, the connections go on and on.
[01:39:56.835 --> 01:39:59.658]  They have over a thousand front environmental groups.
[01:40:00.939 --> 01:40:10.327]  They're one of the biggest landowners in the world, and they openly are founded for eugenics, by eugenicists, to carry on and to educate the public about why they need to die, basically.
[01:40:10.847 --> 01:40:16.953]  And we're now seeing that all with the carbon tax, and humans are the problem, and how we need a one-child policy, or a tax on more than one child.
[01:40:17.653 --> 01:40:37.120]  So, here is the brother of Julian Huxley, the first Director General of UNESCO at the United Nations, openly saying, and of course he gets more into it in his book, the book that he wrote many years later about Brave New World, and he also covers it in a speech that, no, no, no, this is what the elite's planning, that's why he wrote this book.
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:40.421]  I mean, he wrote a book written in 1932 about microchips in people's brains, 1932.
[01:40:41.654 --> 01:40:43.195]  Uh, forced drugging of the population.
[01:40:43.476 --> 01:40:49.441]  And then, of course, we have Bertrand Russell right here with quotes about how they're gonna, with injections, brain damage the children, which they've done quite nicely.
[01:40:51.442 --> 01:40:55.606]  I mean, they're doing it to you and telling you how they're doing it to you.
[01:40:56.446 --> 01:41:04.653]  And I don't agree with them, and I hate them, and you know, they're a bunch of evil creeps, but in a way, they've even got a point, because the general public likes to be injected with deadly poison.
[01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:12.953]  I mean, I mean, you know, because they keep saying, they write, well, we're telling you we're going to hurt you and kill you and see it's because you're scum, you don't even care.
[01:41:13.693 --> 01:41:15.674]  You know, look at how you run around like a bunch of fools.
[01:41:17.335 --> 01:41:20.016]  And when I've talked to New World Order people, they've said, they don't want your help, pal.
[01:41:20.036 --> 01:41:21.197]  That's what, they don't even watch.
[01:41:21.237 --> 01:41:22.437]  They're not going to want your warning.
[01:41:22.917 --> 01:41:23.778]  That's how they are.
[01:41:23.798 --> 01:41:27.379]  I mean, you want to speak before we play this Huxley clip about that psychology they have?
[01:41:27.419 --> 01:41:29.120]  It's, they just openly tell you.
[01:41:30.282 --> 01:41:32.084]  I'm looking at this Bertrand Russell right now.
[01:41:32.144 --> 01:41:34.846]  The top quote is, many people would sooner die than think.
[01:41:35.346 --> 01:41:36.227]  In fact, they do.
[01:41:36.847 --> 01:41:48.196]  And then the quote you were just talking about, diet, injections, and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider desirable.
[01:41:48.837 --> 01:41:56.063]  And any serious criticism of the powers will become psychologically impossible, which will be the exact same thing Huxley's talking about.
[01:41:56.083 --> 01:41:58.765]  Now read the next quote about how we're a bunch of sheep, piece of trash.
[01:42:01.437 --> 01:42:02.017]  Here, give it to me.
[01:42:02.077 --> 01:42:02.778]  I know where it is on there.
[01:42:08.401 --> 01:42:09.002]  I've got it right here.
[01:42:09.982 --> 01:42:19.008]  Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species.
[01:42:19.088 --> 01:42:30.895]  Just as we've heard many times before, a revolt of the plebes, he calls us plebes, will become as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[01:42:32.398 --> 01:42:35.759]  In other words... I want you to read that slowly again because I was fumbling around for the papers.
[01:42:36.119 --> 01:42:37.579]  Read that quote slowly.
[01:42:38.039 --> 01:42:50.363]  Gradually, by selective breeding, the congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they become almost different species.
[01:42:51.143 --> 01:42:54.344]  A revolt of the plebes... plebes... Plebiscites.
[01:42:54.384 --> 01:42:55.084]  General public.
[01:42:55.304 --> 01:42:55.704]  That's you.
[01:42:56.514 --> 01:42:58.134]  Would become as unthinkable?
[01:42:58.235 --> 01:43:04.936]  A revolt of the plebes is as unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating mutton.
[01:43:05.336 --> 01:43:06.637]  We are sheep to them.
[01:43:07.077 --> 01:43:07.777]  We are ruled.
[01:43:07.977 --> 01:43:14.459]  Now, now, before I ever read all these quotes and found literally hundreds of books where they laugh about it and call us slaves all day, I've seen some of this.
[01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:18.160]  I organically, independently, for years have said it's another species.
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.241]  They are literally an aberrant, malfunctioning,
[01:43:24.762 --> 01:43:33.406]  It's just like H.G.
[01:43:33.426 --> 01:43:36.827]  Wells all over again, the sub-human species in the time machine.
[01:43:36.867 --> 01:43:37.487]  The Morlocks.
[01:43:37.848 --> 01:43:42.810]  Yeah, it's supposed to be a reference to the plebes, or us, or the general public in the future.
[01:43:42.850 --> 01:43:43.570]  And he later said that.
[01:43:43.590 --> 01:43:46.131]  He wrote more non-fiction books than he wrote fiction.
[01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:52.036]  I mean, this is the guy who they openly said was their, you know, Illuminati futurist.
[01:43:52.296 --> 01:43:55.439]  And then the eugenics people... He was writing about A-bombs in 1915?
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:56.621]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:56.981 --> 01:44:02.067]  No, just that eugenics conferences, they would joke about it, about the time machine, and just as H.G.
[01:44:02.107 --> 01:44:04.089]  Wells said... No, we have their quotes.
[01:44:04.830 --> 01:44:14.116]  I mean, to tell them, it's not only selective breeding, not only weeding people out through forced sterilization, but it's the stratification, the caste system of races.
[01:44:14.376 --> 01:44:15.217]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[01:44:15.237 --> 01:44:20.660]  I mean, for the general public, when they were selling eugenics to Mom and Pa at the church, it was, we're going to make everybody better.
[01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:21.381]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:44:21.861 --> 01:44:26.184]  The horror you find, imagine being this evil, is that they're actually saying, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:44:26.624 --> 01:44:29.806]  There's too many smart people, we're actually going to brain damage them and hurt them.
[01:44:30.899 --> 01:44:35.520]  And then you wonder why there's a plague on our boys as they sit there drooling in the corner.
[01:44:36.161 --> 01:44:37.001]  And I know you won't listen to me.
[01:44:37.021 --> 01:44:38.441]  You're going to give your next kid shots.
[01:44:39.342 --> 01:44:43.783]  And there's basis in the stratification way back in Galton's so-called science.
[01:44:44.183 --> 01:44:53.486]  He would talk about the probability and he would match up people of similar grades when people of similar grades quote-unquote would breed together.
[01:44:54.786 --> 01:45:01.588]  You know, the statistical difference in intelligence depending upon the grades, but he would always want people from the same grades breeding together.
[01:45:01.608 --> 01:45:04.728]  None of this intermixing that actually does make us better.
[01:45:05.209 --> 01:45:11.930]  He wants to stratify and have a ruling class and an underclass of, you know, different tiers just as in Brave New World.
[01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:14.091]  And again, we've actually looked at the new real genetic studies.
[01:45:14.331 --> 01:45:14.971]  It's the random.
[01:45:16.321 --> 01:45:22.303]  Traditionally, it has been possible to suppress individual freedom through the application of physical coercion through the appeal of ideologies
[01:45:45.798 --> 01:45:54.340]  Through the manipulation of man's physical and social environment, and more recently through the techniques, the cruder techniques of psychological conditioning.
[01:45:55.560 --> 01:46:07.802]  The ultimate revolution, about which Mr. Huxley will speak today, concerns itself with the development of new behavioral controls, which operate directly upon the psychophysiological organisms of man.
[01:46:08.402 --> 01:46:12.823]  That is, the capacity to replace external constraint by internal compulsions.
[01:46:16.961 --> 01:46:32.494]  And here I would like briefly to compare the parable of Brave New World with another parable which was put forth more recently in George Orwell's book 1984.
[01:46:32.674 --> 01:46:44.684]  I'm inclined to think that the scientific dictatorships of the future, and I think there are going to be scientific dictatorships in many parts of the world,
[01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:54.158]  We'll be probably a good deal nearer to the Brave New World pattern than to the 1984 pattern.
[01:46:54.198 --> 01:47:06.450]  They will be a good deal nearer not because of any humanitarian qualms in the scientific dictators, but simply because the Brave New World pattern is probably a good deal more efficient than the other.
[01:47:07.068 --> 01:47:26.518]  But if you can get people to consent to the state of affairs in which they are living, the state of servitude, the state of being, having their differences ironed out and being made amenable to mass production methods on the social level, if you can do this, then you have
[01:47:27.936 --> 01:47:42.284]  You are likely to have a much more stable, a much more lasting society, a much more easily controllable society than you would if you were relying wholly on clubs and firing squads and concentration camps.
[01:47:43.304 --> 01:47:54.750]  In the past, we can say that all revolutions have essentially aimed at changing the environment in order to change the individual.
[01:47:55.150 --> 01:47:55.611]  Today,
[01:47:57.210 --> 01:48:10.140]  We are faced, I think, with the approach of what may be called the ultimate revolution, the final revolution, where a man can act directly on the mind-body of his fellows.
[01:48:10.581 --> 01:48:16.786]  It's exceedingly difficult to see how pure terrorism can function indefinitely.
[01:48:16.826 --> 01:48:25.753]  It can function for a fairly long time, but I think sooner or later you have to bring in an element of persuasion, an element of
[01:48:26.383 --> 01:48:29.385]  of getting people to consent to what is happening to them.
[01:48:30.065 --> 01:48:54.020]  Well, it seems to me that the nature of the ultimate revolution with which we are now faced is precisely this, that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques which will enable the controlling oligarchy, who have always existed and presumably always will exist, to
[01:48:56.132 --> 01:48:59.895]  Get people actually to love their servitude.
[01:49:00.456 --> 01:49:09.504]  People can be made to enjoy a state of affairs which, by any decent standard, they ought not to enjoy.
[01:49:10.064 --> 01:49:18.512]  Well, as I say, we now know the reason why these techniques worked, and there is no doubt at all that we can, if we want to,
[01:49:23.292 --> 01:49:33.815]  We're gonna back that up, come back and play a few more minutes of it.
[01:49:33.855 --> 01:49:35.376]  I mean, there's hours of it, folks.
[01:49:36.576 --> 01:49:37.997]  And remember, this is for the public.
[01:49:39.177 --> 01:49:39.557]  Okay?
[01:49:40.037 --> 01:49:42.858]  When you read their actual writings, they just said they're gonna kill most of us.
[01:49:43.939 --> 01:49:44.259]  Alright?
[01:49:44.499 --> 01:49:45.159]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.857 --> 01:49:59.323]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:59.704 --> 01:50:07.312]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:08.024 --> 01:50:15.068]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:15.488 --> 01:50:26.894]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.214 --> 01:50:30.716]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:31.176 --> 01:50:33.157]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:33.457 --> 01:50:37.279]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:50.535 --> 01:50:55.617]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:55.677 --> 01:51:02.979]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:03.139 --> 01:51:13.782]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:13.963 --> 01:51:18.504]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:18.804 --> 01:51:23.786]  Unbelievably, they even remove small microparticulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:51:24.006 --> 01:51:26.927]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:36.971]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:51:50.450 --> 01:51:57.932]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[01:51:58.092 --> 01:52:00.592]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[01:52:00.652 --> 01:52:06.814]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.
[01:52:07.034 --> 01:52:10.175]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.
[01:52:10.375 --> 01:52:12.835]  In 12 hours, it will stimulate collagen production.
[01:52:13.095 --> 01:52:16.376]  And in 12 hours, it will promote elastin growth in your skin.
[01:52:16.616 --> 01:52:17.397]  What does this all mean?
[01:52:17.657 --> 01:52:22.021]  Well, this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy and helps you look younger.
[01:52:22.302 --> 01:52:31.471]  Night Skin is real, and the results are real, and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin, and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:52:31.751 --> 01:52:34.413]  It's easy, and in 12 hours, you'll see it works.
[01:52:34.634 --> 01:52:35.975]  Try it risk-free today.

[01:52:41.318 --> 01:52:41.538]  That's 1-800-894-3462.
[01:52:41.558 --> 01:52:42.939]  Now I know I've been making this point.
[01:52:42.959 --> 01:52:44.019]  I'm gonna make it again.
[01:52:44.039 --> 01:52:44.279]  There are...
[01:53:02.797 --> 01:53:04.218]  Probably more than 300 books.
[01:53:04.298 --> 01:53:05.419]  It's a wild guesstimation.
[01:53:05.499 --> 01:53:09.402]  We have scanned through and looked up hundreds.
[01:53:11.364 --> 01:53:27.956]  I mean, we're talking about from the 1850s through now, thousands of eugenicists writing books, let's be conservative, hundreds, where top people in every field, I mean, the heads of nuclear programs, the heads of the Genome Project, the heads of everything, saying they want to kill you.
[01:53:28.517 --> 01:53:31.359]  And I mean saying you're not, life has no sanctity.
[01:53:31.969 --> 01:53:35.991]  And they say, so if it's no sanctity for a baby, there's no sanctity for adults.
[01:53:36.071 --> 01:53:37.272]  I mean, they just say it.
[01:53:38.172 --> 01:53:40.333]  But see, they decide you don't have sanctity.
[01:53:40.994 --> 01:53:42.414]  They, they're the scientists.
[01:53:42.454 --> 01:53:43.115]  They know best.
[01:53:43.535 --> 01:53:49.058]  They literally are saying we're lab rats, and that we're a scourge on the earth and they're going to kill us.
[01:53:49.078 --> 01:53:50.438]  Well, I've got news for you, New World Order.
[01:53:50.999 --> 01:53:59.863]  I understand you've got a thought process and a governing system that rationalizes all the things you do, and you have this whole system.
[01:54:00.737 --> 01:54:03.380]  I'm not part of your system, and I'm not going quietly into the night.
[01:54:03.861 --> 01:54:12.073]  You and your, you know, your twit, gentleman, you know, lab coat folks, you can go right into the fires of hell, as far as I'm concerned.
[01:54:13.286 --> 01:54:25.236]  Let's go back to Aldous Huxley, A Brave New World, whose family were taught eugenicists, going back to Darwin, openly getting into how the game is really played, how people love their brainwashing.
[01:54:25.476 --> 01:54:32.482]  See, and a lot of you, even though they tell you, you can't, you love George Bush, you love Hillary, you just can't help it.
[01:54:33.263 --> 01:54:35.024]  And that's why a lot of us are going to die.
[01:54:35.305 --> 01:54:36.966]  Thanks to you being weak.
[01:54:37.286 --> 01:54:39.428]  Here it is.
[01:54:39.448 --> 01:54:53.799]  The recent history of brainwashing, both as applied to prisoners of war and to the lower personnel within the Communist Party in China,
[01:54:54.606 --> 01:55:07.590]  We see that the Pavlovian methods have been applied systematically and evidently with extraordinary efficacy and has got so deep that it's very difficult for it ever to be rooted out.
[01:55:08.343 --> 01:55:22.896]  And these methods, I think, are a real refinement on the older methods of terror, because they combine methods of terror with methods of acceptance.
[01:55:23.376 --> 01:55:34.066]  But we now, I think, know pretty clearly the sort of statistical structure of a population in regard to its suggestibility.
[01:55:34.804 --> 01:55:42.206]  Quite clearly, if everybody were extremely unsuggestible, organized society would be quite impossible.
[01:55:43.367 --> 01:55:51.009]  And if everybody were extremely suggestible, then dictatorship would be absolutely inevitable.
[01:55:51.049 --> 01:56:02.253]  I mean, it's very fortunate we have people who are moderately suggestible in the majority, and who therefore preserve us from dictatorship, but do permit organized society to
[01:56:03.825 --> 01:56:04.546]  To be formed.
[01:56:05.326 --> 01:56:16.810]  After all, we've had the most incredible example in recent years of what can be done by efficient methods of suggestion and persuasion.
[01:56:16.830 --> 01:56:18.711]  All right, stop right there.
[01:56:18.731 --> 01:56:24.634]  We're going to come back in the next hour, play the last two minutes of it, and then get into the modern history of eugenics, and then the future, where we're going.
[01:56:25.114 --> 01:56:27.215]  The modern history, the present, and the future.
[01:56:27.695 --> 01:56:30.456]  We're the full hour with Aaron Dykes, but I wanted to play this clip.
[01:56:30.476 --> 01:56:32.037]  We've got one more clip from a 1930
[01:56:33.712 --> 01:56:37.635]  Two film, or is it four?
[01:56:37.655 --> 01:56:48.244]  1934 film, Tomorrow's Children, where they were promoting a CPS grabbing people's children and sterilizing them and taking them to facilities where they would be drugged until death, of course.
[01:56:48.264 --> 01:56:53.569]  Not very advertised today for you, but that's where these cores of evil come from.
[01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:56.051]  It didn't just fall off a turnip truck last week.
[01:56:56.811 --> 01:56:59.294]  But you listen to Mr. Snakeman, he's actually for all this.
[01:56:59.534 --> 01:57:01.916]  He's there selling this
[01:57:02.842 --> 01:57:10.284]  to the top sociologist in psychology and psychiatry, a master's and PhD students at Berkeley.
[01:57:11.825 --> 01:57:19.087]  Packed room, and he said, of course we've got to have the suggestibility for some of the ordered society.
[01:57:19.107 --> 01:57:21.568]  I mean, he's a little bit reasonable.
[01:57:22.808 --> 01:57:29.210]  See, I mean, and now these very people run the media and the culture, and they go, there's no New World Order, there's no...
[01:57:31.033 --> 01:57:35.700]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:47.444 --> 01:57:48.085]  Big Brother.
[01:57:48.765 --> 01:57:49.786]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.526 --> 01:57:51.647]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.307 --> 01:57:53.108]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.869 --> 01:57:54.789]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:59.392]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.612 --> 01:58:03.735]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.657 --> 01:58:09.479]  I'll tell you, it is a sobering realization.
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:13.182]  Hard akin to jumping into ice cold water.
[01:58:14.783 --> 01:58:16.404]  When you come to full grip,
[01:58:17.268 --> 01:58:18.789]  And I don't think I've even done that completely yet.
[01:58:18.849 --> 01:58:20.510]  It's hard for me to even grasp it.
[01:58:21.130 --> 01:58:41.260]  That the ruling elite of the planet love killing innocent people, love dumbing people down, love poisoning children, love the fact that there are tens of millions of autistic children now in the West, lives completely ruined, families ruined, families put through hell, and that they're putting cancer viruses in us, and they love it!
[01:58:42.101 --> 01:58:46.523]  It's fun, and they're going to keep doing it, and I think you're going to keep watching ball games,
[01:58:47.634 --> 01:58:51.216]  You're going to laugh at me and you're just not going to read the books written by them or find out they run everything.
[01:58:51.497 --> 01:58:52.577]  Okay, fine.
[01:58:52.617 --> 01:58:53.918]  Let's go back to Aaron Dykes.
[01:58:54.018 --> 01:59:00.322]  Aaron, let's... this little last part here of Aldous Huxley and then we will get into the analysis.
[01:59:00.743 --> 01:59:01.163]  Here it is.
[01:59:01.983 --> 01:59:06.386]  ...of suggestion and persuasion in the form of Hitler.
[01:59:07.027 --> 01:59:13.551]  Anybody who's read, for example, Burke's Life of Hitler comes forth from this with
[01:59:14.609 --> 01:59:29.541]  A sort of horrified admiration for this infernal genius who really understood human weaknesses, I think, almost better than anybody, and who exploited them with all the resources then available.
[01:59:29.561 --> 01:59:31.223]  I mean, he knew everything.
[01:59:31.263 --> 01:59:40.250]  I mean, for example, he knew intuitively this Pavlovian truth that conditioning installed in a state of stress or fatigue
[01:59:41.416 --> 01:59:44.519]  It goes much deeper than conditioning installed at other times.
[01:59:45.079 --> 01:59:49.342]  This was why all his big speeches were organized.
[01:59:50.443 --> 01:59:51.324]  Do a Google search.
[01:59:51.364 --> 02:00:05.835]  We've probably covered three dozen of these in the last few years, where they now have school drills, not just with the SWAT teams unannounced running in, putting guns at children's heads as young as seven years, six years of age, while they cry and wet themselves.
[02:00:07.003 --> 02:00:13.454]  Now in public schools, they will not let them have a snack, make them stay in the classroom, defecate and urinate in trash cans.
[02:00:13.975 --> 02:00:14.676]  You think I'm joking?
[02:00:14.696 --> 02:00:15.357]  Type it into Google.
[02:00:15.397 --> 02:00:16.139]  It's all over the news.
[02:00:16.439 --> 02:00:18.603]  I mean, I've probably seen 30, 40 articles on that alone.
[02:00:19.665 --> 02:00:30.178]  No lunch, and then at about three o'clock, after no food all day, these children are never gone, really, without eating that long, so they're, you know, somebody who's used to not eating all day, sometimes can handle the blood sugar.
[02:00:30.218 --> 02:00:31.480]  The kids feel horrible headaches.
[02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:32.061]  They're crying.
[02:00:32.581 --> 02:00:34.684]  They are defecating in front of each other.
[02:00:34.704 --> 02:00:37.367]  I mean, this is hardcore mind control.
[02:00:37.948 --> 02:00:38.509]  Hardcore.
[02:00:39.552 --> 02:00:42.155]  And don't laugh, yuppies, seeing this on the web, Larry.
[02:00:42.236 --> 02:00:43.417]  You go Google it.
[02:00:43.737 --> 02:00:45.279]  You pull up mainstream news.
[02:00:45.319 --> 02:00:49.865]  And then, of course, you will then do double-think, sub-conditioning, and convince yourself it was good.
[02:00:50.105 --> 02:00:50.666]  I understand.
[02:00:51.607 --> 02:00:52.728]  But catch yourself in that.
[02:00:53.029 --> 02:00:53.789]  Now you're denying it.
[02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:57.414]  Go find out it's true, and then catch your brain, instantly shift, and tell you it's alright.
[02:00:58.201 --> 02:01:01.784]  And maybe you can notice the mind control you're under that Huxley's laughing at you about right now.
[02:01:02.085 --> 02:01:03.346]  See, I want you to be free.
[02:01:03.526 --> 02:01:04.066]  I want to be free.
[02:01:04.106 --> 02:01:05.287]  I'm telling you you've been conned.
[02:01:05.648 --> 02:01:06.689]  But anyways, I'm digressing.
[02:01:07.329 --> 02:01:15.196]  After the no food, the urinating, the defecating in front of each other, the humiliation, the stink in the classrooms, then the SWAT team shit.
[02:01:16.588 --> 02:01:24.552]  Then the SWAT, and in some cases then, they then after that bring in cake and ice cream and the officers are all friendly, and then it's all a big happy time.
[02:01:24.692 --> 02:01:28.073]  Folks, that is as hardcore mind control as it gets.
[02:01:28.113 --> 02:01:30.995]  And I can't believe the cops are so dumb that they don't know.
[02:01:31.015 --> 02:01:31.795]  I mean, can you imagine?
[02:01:32.776 --> 02:01:36.978]  Aaron, I'm just bringing this up off the top because it sounds so incredible, people won't check it out and they won't believe me.
[02:01:37.178 --> 02:01:39.999]  Have you ever run into those stories where they gotta go to the bathroom in the trash cans?
[02:01:40.971 --> 02:01:43.772]  Uh, yeah, I think I found that story when I first started working here.
[02:01:44.252 --> 02:01:50.755]  And one of my friends from high school told me recently she was in a drill where they pointed guns at her face in the hall.
[02:01:51.295 --> 02:01:52.736]  You know, something she works in a school.
[02:01:53.496 --> 02:01:54.697]  This was when she was in high school.
[02:01:54.897 --> 02:01:55.217]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:56.217 --> 02:01:57.638]  But imagine seven year olds.
[02:01:58.638 --> 02:02:00.039]  I mean, folks, I'm a full grown man.
[02:02:00.880 --> 02:02:03.364]  And I've never been in the military, so I guess I haven't been conditioned to it.
[02:02:03.864 --> 02:02:11.635]  But, you know, I've been in like, you know, out in the national parks and everything, in these primitive bathrooms, where there's a toilet right there, and somebody walks in while you're using the bathroom.
[02:02:11.875 --> 02:02:17.323]  I mean, I'm a man, and I'm pretty... I'm not tough, but I don't like... I like privacy while I'm using the bathroom.
[02:02:17.703 --> 02:02:20.045]  Can you imagine these kids having to go to the bathroom?
[02:02:20.625 --> 02:02:25.508]  By the way, they've got these unisex bathrooms at a lot of public schools now, where they make you all go in the bathroom together.
[02:02:25.528 --> 02:02:29.711]  See, this is all meant to break down our normal human mammalian activities.
[02:02:30.131 --> 02:02:30.532]  Stay there.
[02:02:30.892 --> 02:02:32.713]  Folks, they're torturing your children right now.
[02:02:43.157 --> 02:02:48.259]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:02:48.319 --> 02:02:55.641]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:02:55.781 --> 02:03:06.444]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:03:06.605 --> 02:03:11.146]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:03:11.446 --> 02:03:16.431]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:03:16.632 --> 02:03:19.575]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:19.815 --> 02:03:29.565]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black virgin elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:03:42.994 --> 02:03:51.480]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:59.445]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:00.177 --> 02:04:07.219]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:19.043]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:19.363 --> 02:04:22.845]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:23.325 --> 02:04:25.225]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:25.586 --> 02:04:29.427]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:46.073 --> 02:04:47.213]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[02:04:47.393 --> 02:04:51.515]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:04:52.139 --> 02:04:57.023]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[02:04:57.544 --> 02:05:03.969]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[02:05:04.708 --> 02:05:07.410]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:05:07.570 --> 02:05:17.537]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:05:17.817 --> 02:05:21.540]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:05:21.580 --> 02:05:28.084]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:05:28.244 --> 02:05:29.285]  Are you ready to go solar?
[02:05:29.485 --> 02:05:30.446]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.

[02:05:42.900 --> 02:05:47.946]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:48.307 --> 02:05:50.590]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:52.635 --> 02:05:59.040]  Let's finish up with Huxley, and then we'll go to Aaron Dyke.
[02:05:59.100 --> 02:06:01.081]  Here's the rest of Huxley.
[02:06:01.261 --> 02:06:04.363]  This was why all his big speeches
[02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:19.561]  We're organized at night.
[02:06:20.702 --> 02:06:37.494]  In this field of pure persuasion, I think we do know much more than we did in the past, and obviously we now have mechanisms for multiplying the demagogues' voice and image in a quite hallucinatory way.
[02:06:37.534 --> 02:06:40.016]  I mean, the television and the radio.
[02:06:40.937 --> 02:06:43.238]  Hitler was making enormous use of the radio.
[02:06:43.299 --> 02:06:46.461]  He could speak to millions of people simultaneously.
[02:06:48.687 --> 02:06:50.068]  And we've got a lot more of that.
[02:06:50.388 --> 02:06:52.009]  You can find that on Berkley's website.
[02:06:52.029 --> 02:06:54.971]  Just type, what, Huxley, Berkley speech?
[02:06:55.631 --> 02:06:56.692]  How did you find it again, Aaron?
[02:06:57.072 --> 02:06:58.053]  Huxley, Berkley.
[02:06:58.093 --> 02:06:58.513]  The year was 1962.
[02:06:58.753 --> 02:07:03.376]  That might help, but it definitely came up pretty quickly in the searches there.
[02:07:03.836 --> 02:07:05.077]  And there's even work stuff in there.
[02:07:05.097 --> 02:07:06.638]  It's just we don't have time to play it all.
[02:07:06.658 --> 02:07:07.938]  You want to play tomorrow's children's?
[02:07:07.998 --> 02:07:08.979]  It's one of the trouble to upload.
[02:07:09.039 --> 02:07:10.420]  It's about four minutes long.
[02:07:11.368 --> 02:07:14.111]  Well, it's a pretty good clip on... Let's describe this first.
[02:07:14.131 --> 02:07:14.871]  Describe it for people.
[02:07:15.212 --> 02:07:18.314]  It's kind of a boil down of the forcible sterilization law.
[02:07:18.334 --> 02:07:20.496]  Of course, it's a movie, so it's a bit dramatized.
[02:07:21.237 --> 02:07:28.644]  But you'll see how social workers tell you they are the ones who are going to make the decision if your family is going to be sterilized.
[02:07:29.144 --> 02:07:32.928]  And you'll see that the judge will make the decision not based on
[02:07:34.012 --> 02:07:36.413]  And the guy makes the parallel of it being a crime.
[02:07:36.433 --> 02:07:40.995]  She hasn't been proven guilty yet, and the judge says, but your children could be bad.
[02:07:41.435 --> 02:07:44.476]  You may be healthy, but your children could be bad, couldn't they?
[02:07:44.516 --> 02:07:46.677]  Therefore, we must forcibly sterilize you.
[02:07:46.837 --> 02:07:47.937]  Now, we've watched the whole film.
[02:07:47.977 --> 02:07:51.139]  It's only about 55 minutes long, and it's a pro-eugenics film.
[02:07:51.159 --> 02:07:51.899]  The way they do it is,
[02:07:52.908 --> 02:08:05.585]  The family does have several crippled children and another brother is in jail and so the social workers come by and grab them and take them to be sterilized at the facilities and to be institutionalized.
[02:08:06.517 --> 02:08:10.199]  But she's really an orphan and really comes from a high-blood family.
[02:08:10.419 --> 02:08:13.841]  She's beautiful, not like the scum that deserve to be sterilized.
[02:08:14.322 --> 02:08:16.983]  And it's perfect psychology.
[02:08:17.003 --> 02:08:21.926]  So it's like, it's saying eugenics is good, but oh, in her case, we don't want it to happen to her.
[02:08:22.446 --> 02:08:25.888]  And it shows people locked up in facilities, being castrated.
[02:08:26.749 --> 02:08:29.750]  It's got the social workers going and grabbing people.
[02:08:32.964 --> 02:08:33.844]  Don't know which clip you got.
[02:08:33.884 --> 02:08:38.046]  Did you get the main clip where she's at the house explaining you're going to be sterilized too?
[02:08:38.486 --> 02:08:40.406]  And then do you have the clip where she's in front of the judge?
[02:08:40.686 --> 02:08:41.887]  Exactly, that's what we're going to hear.
[02:08:42.147 --> 02:08:42.847]  Okay, here it is.
[02:08:45.888 --> 02:08:47.188]  Excuse everybody, where's Mom?
[02:08:47.829 --> 02:08:48.809]  She didn't take sick again.
[02:08:49.529 --> 02:08:50.289]  Are you Alice Mason?
[02:08:51.390 --> 02:08:51.790]  Uh, yes.
[02:08:52.190 --> 02:08:53.170]  But where are Mom and the kids?
[02:08:53.850 --> 02:08:56.031]  Well, they're all safe, so there's nothing for you to worry about.
[02:08:56.571 --> 02:08:57.152]  Now sit down.
[02:08:57.652 --> 02:08:58.332]  I want to talk to you.
[02:09:01.207 --> 02:09:03.127]  I'm Mrs. Wright of the Welfare Association.
[02:09:03.727 --> 02:09:05.248]  You're 17, aren't you, Alice?
[02:09:06.068 --> 02:09:07.888]  Yes, but what have you done with my folks?
[02:09:08.488 --> 02:09:10.429]  Well, we're trying to help them, Alice, and you too.
[02:09:11.389 --> 02:09:13.309]  They were taken to the hospital this afternoon.
[02:09:13.509 --> 02:09:13.989]  Hospital?
[02:09:14.409 --> 02:09:15.710]  Wasn't one of them sick this morning?
[02:09:16.570 --> 02:09:17.610]  My isn't working, is she?
[02:09:18.430 --> 02:09:18.970]  Where's Pa?
[02:09:19.550 --> 02:09:21.031]  He's gone to the hospital too, Alice.
[02:09:21.871 --> 02:09:22.911]  I don't see what for.
[02:09:22.931 --> 02:09:25.411]  You're sure you didn't put him in jail?
[02:09:25.431 --> 02:09:26.411]  Of course not.
[02:09:26.712 --> 02:09:28.012]  I said we were trying to help them.
[02:09:28.212 --> 02:09:29.032]  You better tell her.
[02:09:30.239 --> 02:09:31.119]  So she'll understand.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:36.142]  Well, we thought it necessary to present your family's case to the state medical commission.
[02:09:36.882 --> 02:09:40.924]  After an examination, they decided it was but one important action to take.
[02:09:41.745 --> 02:09:44.526]  To have your entire family sterilized.
[02:09:45.087 --> 02:09:45.847]  Why, what's that?
[02:09:46.327 --> 02:09:47.608]  I don't know what you're talking about!
[02:09:47.628 --> 02:09:49.929]  Well, we investigated your family's history, Alice.
[02:09:50.970 --> 02:09:53.731]  And those of the past three generations have been feeble-minded.
[02:09:54.591 --> 02:09:57.553]  Some genital cripples, or a vitriol broken.
[02:09:58.627 --> 02:10:01.749]  Instead of improving, each generation is more of a problem.
[02:10:02.530 --> 02:10:08.294]  Now, in this state, we have a law which provides for such people to have an operation so there won't be any more children.
[02:10:09.175 --> 02:10:09.675]  I see.
[02:10:10.456 --> 02:10:13.899]  Now, we've placed your brothers in institutions where they'll be properly cared for.
[02:10:13.919 --> 02:10:16.080]  I'm going to go back to your job, too.
[02:10:16.521 --> 02:10:18.102]  I'll arrange to have them held open for you.
[02:10:18.542 --> 02:10:20.183]  But I'm keeping my job.
[02:10:20.264 --> 02:10:21.384]  I'm not going anywhere.
[02:10:21.404 --> 02:10:23.866]  Now, you're going to the hospital, too, Ralph.
[02:10:24.647 --> 02:10:25.948]  But there's nothing wrong with me.
[02:10:26.668 --> 02:10:27.229]  Perhaps not.
[02:10:28.763 --> 02:10:32.444]  You wouldn't want to marry such a fine young man and be ashamed of the children you have.
[02:10:32.964 --> 02:10:35.764]  And you mean they're going to stop me from having children ever?
[02:10:37.345 --> 02:10:37.845]  Exactly.
[02:10:39.025 --> 02:10:39.945]  I'm all right, I tell you.
[02:10:39.965 --> 02:10:41.065]  I won't go to any hospital.
[02:10:41.305 --> 02:10:43.966]  Now, Alex, you must be reasonable.
[02:10:44.126 --> 02:10:50.207]  Now, we got a court order that besides your parents gave permission, you'll get a chance to tell your side of it in court.
[02:10:50.907 --> 02:10:51.987]  I won't go, I tell you.
[02:10:52.487 --> 02:10:54.007]  We don't want any trouble with you, young woman.
[02:10:54.568 --> 02:10:56.928]  If you refuse to go, the officer here will take you by force.
[02:11:00.589 --> 02:11:00.909]  All right.
[02:11:01.429 --> 02:11:02.350]  Maybe I'd better go.
[02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:04.650]  You might be transferring me in court.
[02:11:05.590 --> 02:11:05.951]  Sure.
[02:11:06.031 --> 02:11:06.591]  Of course.
[02:11:07.671 --> 02:11:09.632]  You don't mind if I go to my room and get some things?
[02:11:10.412 --> 02:11:10.972]  I'll need them.
[02:11:11.312 --> 02:11:12.152]  Go right ahead.
[02:11:13.613 --> 02:11:14.353]  Alice Mason!
[02:11:15.213 --> 02:11:18.474]  Come on, Jim.
[02:11:22.495 --> 02:11:23.596]  Are you interested in this case?
[02:11:23.676 --> 02:11:24.316]  Yes, Your Honor.
[02:11:24.776 --> 02:11:26.496]  I'm Dr. Brooks of the county hospital.
[02:11:26.796 --> 02:11:28.557]  This is Jim Baker, Miss Mason's fiance.
[02:11:29.628 --> 02:11:30.889]  What testimony have you to offer?
[02:11:31.349 --> 02:11:34.850]  In the case of Miss Mason, I can see no reason for the operation that's been recommended.
[02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:36.431]  The girl is perfectly normal.
[02:11:36.931 --> 02:11:38.812]  She's hard-working and has a good reputation.
[02:11:39.132 --> 02:11:40.972]  Do you know anything about her family background?
[02:11:41.513 --> 02:11:42.313]  Yes, Your Honor, I do.
[02:11:42.533 --> 02:11:44.194]  There are several other children, aren't there?
[02:11:44.494 --> 02:11:44.734]  Yes.
[02:11:45.094 --> 02:11:45.934]  What is their condition?
[02:11:47.415 --> 02:11:50.796]  One is a cripple, two others might be classed as feeble-minded.
[02:11:50.996 --> 02:11:52.417]  Isn't the oldest son in jail?
[02:11:53.072 --> 02:11:54.153]  Well, yes, I believe so.
[02:11:54.613 --> 02:11:59.415]  And knowing all that, you still contend that this girl should be allowed to bring more people like that into the world?
[02:11:59.756 --> 02:12:01.136]  She's sound, Your Honor.
[02:12:01.437 --> 02:12:02.617]  She's not anything like the rest.
[02:12:03.298 --> 02:12:05.979]  Surely she should be given a chance to work out her own salvation.
[02:12:06.119 --> 02:12:07.420]  I can't agree with you, Doctor.
[02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:08.941]  Suppose she is normal.
[02:12:09.561 --> 02:12:12.222]  The chances are that her children will inherit the family faith.
[02:12:12.683 --> 02:12:13.383]  Isn't that possible?
[02:12:14.303 --> 02:12:16.405]  But, Your Honor, I... I'm sorry, Doctor.
[02:12:16.965 --> 02:12:19.046]  Three generations of unfit are enough.
[02:12:19.866 --> 02:12:20.787]  Petition not allowed.
[02:12:23.059 --> 02:12:28.102]  That's actually an Oliver Wendell Holmes quote that they have the judge deliver.
[02:12:29.143 --> 02:12:29.744]  Isn't it Aaron?
[02:12:30.984 --> 02:12:37.369]  Oliver Wendell Holmes from the Buck vs. Bell case in 1927 where they upheld forcible sterilization.
[02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:45.864]  Now, again, this is a public face that they're going to just sterilize the bad people, which we're not saying we're for, you know, bad in quotes.
[02:12:46.184 --> 02:12:50.287]  Really, they want to dumb down their competition and actually hurt everybody.
[02:12:50.747 --> 02:12:59.072]  It's the opposite of even, I mean, it's horrible enough to say they want to do this because they know how to run things and want to help us, but in truth, they're just, it's so diabolical.
[02:13:00.578 --> 02:13:09.502]  Well, sure, you see the plan to separate the population into a caste system, have divergent species, but that's not what's put forward in propaganda, of course.
[02:13:10.023 --> 02:13:20.628]  Of course, in the 20s and before that, they were promoting a better society, how everyone was going to be uplifted, just as you see with the transhuman movement today.
[02:13:21.388 --> 02:13:24.810]  It's going to be for everyone, but we'll soon find out that it won't be for everyone.
[02:13:25.050 --> 02:13:28.232]  And the Pentagon in 2000, it was written in 98, but they released it in 2000, wrote
[02:13:29.594 --> 02:13:34.003]  They got real mad at the Federation of American Scientists because they declassified it to them but they weren't supposed to release it.
[02:13:34.544 --> 02:13:38.572]  And they said, we're going to use fads and media to make brain chips cool.
[02:13:39.548 --> 02:13:44.133]  And they said, we'll first get chips under the skin, then we're going to get brain chips, and we're just going to make it stylish.
[02:13:44.554 --> 02:13:47.236]  And then the old timer parents will go, no, no, don't do that, it's Big Brother.
[02:13:47.577 --> 02:13:49.098]  Shut up, I'm going into the operation.
[02:13:49.319 --> 02:13:50.039]  It's my right.
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:51.241]  There's been rules written.
[02:13:51.501 --> 02:13:56.246]  And then we've had transhumanist, I mean, top scientists, and they go, well, you just won't be able to have a job.
[02:13:56.266 --> 02:14:01.632]  You know, you don't have to have the chip, just like you don't have to have the national ID card, but don't leave your house without it.
[02:14:02.210 --> 02:14:03.551]  Now, Alex, it will be cool.
[02:14:03.571 --> 02:14:07.172]  We won't have to open doors or, uh, you know, check into things.
[02:14:07.192 --> 02:14:11.714]  We'll just have this cool little chip under our arm and... But these friends will control it, though.
[02:14:12.954 --> 02:14:14.715]  Jimmy, let's say angels ran the government.
[02:14:15.175 --> 02:14:17.996]  Yeah, then maybe it would be cool to have a brain chip so I could dial into my computer.
[02:14:18.457 --> 02:14:26.660]  But the point is, is that it fully compromises the basic, uh, of what a human species is, and then this elite, everything they've done is basically evil.
[02:14:27.597 --> 02:14:29.819]  I mean, these people folks are bad news, you understand?
[02:14:29.839 --> 02:14:31.060]  Well, that's the problem.
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:37.746]  It's always an ethical debate of, well, there are some moral issues, so we have to make sure we keep ethics in check.
[02:14:37.806 --> 02:14:40.888]  We're going to safeguard, and really it's to codify moving forward.
[02:14:40.908 --> 02:14:42.910]  It's like IBM saying, we promise
[02:14:42.910 --> 02:14:47.555]  Yes, we won't use the genetic data of our 130,000 employees against you.
[02:14:47.835 --> 02:14:48.876]  But give us your blood!
[02:14:49.196 --> 02:14:51.919]  And then, I see it in National Geographic a few months ago.
[02:14:52.339 --> 02:14:59.887]  Oh, IBM and National Geographic are going all over the world to get the Human Migratory Pass to see how the three subraces are all interrelated.
[02:14:59.947 --> 02:15:01.208]  Negro, Anglo, and Asian.
[02:15:01.948 --> 02:15:04.270]  And, uh, oh, guess what?
[02:15:04.371 --> 02:15:17.502]  It just so happens, I know IBM was doing studies for the Pentagon, the problem with race-specific bioweapons is we've all got the same traits, so they have to get basic genetic markers so they can use a bioweapon on the Arabs that won't kill Jews or Caucasians.
[02:15:17.922 --> 02:15:26.385]  And I guarantee you this migratory trait test they're advertising all over the place and I knew it and I went and researched the last few days and sure enough all the nexus points are there.
[02:15:26.665 --> 02:15:35.909]  It's a huge bioweapons research project right out in plain view and you're giving them your blood to find out your genome and your history and your migratory background.
[02:15:35.929 --> 02:15:36.889]  Are you insane?
[02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.610]  Go ahead Aaron.
[02:15:37.690 --> 02:15:46.353]  And of course we spot check for IBM members who do pop up at the Cold Springs Harbor where eugenics... All top command positions.
[02:15:47.262 --> 02:16:03.135]  The Eugenics Records Office, IBM checks out there, and the Human Genome Project, which is led by James Watson, the guy who discovered DNA and discovered it was a double helix and is still in operation today, not only works out of the Cold Springs Harbor, but opened a school there.
[02:16:03.195 --> 02:16:05.036]  The first graduating class, I believe, was 2004.
[02:16:05.477 --> 02:16:07.238]  And he was the head of it!
[02:16:08.010 --> 02:16:09.411]  Yeah, he's currently the head of it now.
[02:16:10.072 --> 02:16:11.973]  But before that, he was the head of Cold Springs Harbor.
[02:16:12.353 --> 02:16:28.006]  And he also says, well, I may have been working there during the whole thing, but I'm not a eugenicist, but I do believe there's no sanctity of life, and that arguments against controlling genetics and sterilizing all this are... No, I mean, I'm for it.
[02:16:28.526 --> 02:16:28.986]  That's right.
[02:16:29.006 --> 02:16:35.071]  So it's like saying, I'm not for putting an ax into your head, but I am for putting a hatchet into your head.
[02:16:35.151 --> 02:16:36.012]  I mean, it's the same thing.
[02:16:36.730 --> 02:16:47.504]  Yeah, it's a case in point of how we have this ethical debate, and he says he wrote up the ethics into the Genome Project so people wouldn't accuse him of being a quasi-eugenicist.
[02:16:47.804 --> 02:16:51.589]  But here's the point, it's a eugenics facility that it's been being run out of from the start.
[02:16:55.689 --> 02:16:59.132]  Aaron, we would just say, let's randomly pick this person's name and see if they're eugenicists, and they would be.
[02:16:59.152 --> 02:17:01.695]  I mean, it was just, we were just randomly, it was, it's everywhere!
[02:17:02.155 --> 02:17:03.757]  I've never seen such connections!
[02:17:04.037 --> 02:17:06.139]  Folks, we have found out the key, I'm telling you.
[02:17:06.459 --> 02:17:09.302]  This, this, uh, Aaron, I mean, no, I'm serious, we've discovered it!
[02:17:09.682 --> 02:17:17.229]  There's so much information coming in, we thought it was gonna be five or ten minutes, now I don't know if it's gonna be the whole film, uh, in endgame or what, but...
[02:17:18.288 --> 02:17:20.009]  Yeah, we're just drowning in information.
[02:17:20.089 --> 02:17:21.671]  It's absolutely incredible.
[02:17:22.111 --> 02:17:25.434]  They run, I mean, would you say they run 95% of the scientific community?
[02:17:25.734 --> 02:17:28.996]  They're completely infused everything you know to be science today.
[02:17:30.097 --> 02:17:31.578]  Computers were invented for eugenics.
[02:17:32.459 --> 02:17:37.703]  Yeah, we found documents for 1928, a Jamaican cross race study.
[02:17:37.823 --> 02:17:38.964]  We got a break, we'll be right back.
[02:17:43.152 --> 02:17:46.174]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:17:46.475 --> 02:17:51.398]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:17:51.659 --> 02:17:56.022]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:17:56.302 --> 02:18:05.229]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:09.052]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:18:09.332 --> 02:18:14.379]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:18:14.659 --> 02:18:21.408]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:18:21.889 --> 02:18:22.269]  What about you?
[02:18:23.175 --> 02:18:28.537]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[02:18:28.577 --> 02:18:29.737]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:29.757 --> 02:18:31.638]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:18:31.658 --> 02:18:34.218]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:18:49.890 --> 02:18:54.713]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:18:54.914 --> 02:18:57.655]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:18:57.696 --> 02:18:58.816]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:19:00.157 --> 02:19:04.760]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:19:05.681 --> 02:19:12.946]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:19:13.947 --> 02:19:16.989]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:19:19.139 --> 02:19:22.580]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:24.840]  Call for your copy today.
[02:19:25.100 --> 02:19:27.301]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:28.361 --> 02:19:34.202]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:19:34.903 --> 02:19:35.303]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:35.363 --> 02:19:35.563]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:43.482 --> 02:19:45.423]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[02:19:45.863 --> 02:19:47.604]  Look, up there in the sky.
[02:19:48.024 --> 02:19:49.324]  It's Non-X-Man.
[02:19:49.344 --> 02:19:50.905]  He's in a dive.
[02:19:51.185 --> 02:19:53.186]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:19:53.486 --> 02:19:54.246]  Let's go look.
[02:19:56.467 --> 02:19:59.648]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[02:20:00.068 --> 02:20:01.409]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:20:01.629 --> 02:20:02.049]  Take them out.
[02:20:02.688 --> 02:20:03.349]  Let's see.
[02:20:03.369 --> 02:20:07.974]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:20:08.314 --> 02:20:08.795]  Don't worry.
[02:20:09.236 --> 02:20:10.757]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:20:11.378 --> 02:20:15.803]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:20:16.344 --> 02:20:18.406]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[02:20:18.526 --> 02:20:21.229]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:20:23.351 --> 02:20:25.994]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:20:26.474 --> 02:20:29.958]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:20:30.478 --> 02:20:41.609]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:20:43.025 --> 02:20:45.447]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:46.068 --> 02:20:51.352]  Are radical Islamic nations seeking to gain control of the Security Council of the United Nations?
[02:20:51.692 --> 02:20:53.494]  What would be their purpose for doing so?
[02:20:54.094 --> 02:20:58.578]  For a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine, just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[02:20:58.978 --> 02:20:59.159]  Call now!
[02:21:12.999 --> 02:21:15.440]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:21:15.921 --> 02:21:19.782]  Did you know that the prophecies of the Bible are far in advance of today's news?
[02:21:20.403 --> 02:21:23.604]  It discusses a coming economic system called the Mark of the Beast.
[02:21:24.365 --> 02:21:29.527]  You can receive a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine by calling our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:29.827 --> 02:21:30.507]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:21:30.527 --> 02:21:30.708]  Call now.
[02:21:52.896 --> 02:21:55.717]  The elite, again, have always had disdain for the general public.
[02:21:56.877 --> 02:21:59.378]  Now they've scientifically found a rationale for it.
[02:21:59.398 --> 02:22:02.798]  It's the end of World War II, the Nazis come over here.
[02:22:03.479 --> 02:22:08.400]  There are more than 20,000 tests conducted, chemicals, biologicals sprayed.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:16.482]  Uranium, I even found the isotopes last night that's specifically put in pills and gave to thousands of people on base.
[02:22:16.502 --> 02:22:17.942]  They give them to troops, their wives.
[02:22:17.962 --> 02:22:21.523]  Let me find the actual numbers here.
[02:22:22.668 --> 02:22:33.833]  Pregnant wives of GIs were given vitamins by base doctors that actually consisted of highly radioactive Uranium-239 and Plutonium-241, resulting in violent miscarriages.
[02:22:34.593 --> 02:22:37.094]  And people know about the Atomic Soldiers Project, Chad.
[02:22:37.114 --> 02:22:39.975]  They'd put our troops in chambers and kill them with nerve gas.
[02:22:40.655 --> 02:22:47.118]  And more than just testing nerve gas on troops, it was to see if they had scientific cores that would do it when need be.
[02:22:47.873 --> 02:22:55.160]  Like they have helicopter corps do practice biological spraying with Subtilis Globigi all over the US routinely.
[02:22:55.380 --> 02:22:56.241]  And they even announce it.
[02:22:56.301 --> 02:23:04.629]  That way when they tell the troops to put these spray bottles on and go spray and it's gas that will kill everybody or gas that will release a bioweapon, they'll do it.
[02:23:04.649 --> 02:23:06.691]  So see there's lots of reasons they do this.
[02:23:06.791 --> 02:23:09.414]  Aaron, bring us through the 60s right through the present.
[02:23:09.434 --> 02:23:11.496]  When we come back, let's get into transhumanism in the future.
[02:23:12.506 --> 02:23:19.328]  Well, in the 60s, of course, it became that phase of quietly doing it, doing it so no one would notice.
[02:23:20.008 --> 02:23:29.791]  You heard Aldous Huxley say he has a horrified admiration for Hitler, and there's an interesting quote... And then he went on to say he's been in mental facilities.
[02:23:29.811 --> 02:23:33.812]  I don't know if we played that, where they already had wires in their heads, remote controlling them in the 60s.
[02:23:35.006 --> 02:23:36.427]  Yeah, that's very much the case.
[02:23:37.467 --> 02:23:49.552]  You'll see that Francis Galton said in a eugenics essay called Definition, Scope, and Aims, I see no impossibility in eugenics becoming a religious dogma among mankind.
[02:23:50.253 --> 02:23:52.134]  A religious dogma among mankind.
[02:23:52.574 --> 02:23:55.235]  But its details must first be worded out
[02:23:56.091 --> 02:24:01.016]  Well, sedulously in the study, overzeal leading to hasty action would do harm.
[02:24:01.196 --> 02:24:12.387]  And we saw Buddhist monks last week at Live Earth, and the Vatican, having meetings at sacred sites, saying it's now of the Lord we must reduce carbon footprint.
[02:24:12.768 --> 02:24:16.972]  Yeah, I think that concert would fall under overzeal in my opinion, but I could be wrong.
[02:24:17.572 --> 02:24:28.199]  Yeah, he warns of overzeal and says holding out expectations for a near golden age would disappoint and certainly be falsified and cause the science to be discredited.
[02:24:28.559 --> 02:24:36.344]  The first and main point is to secure the general intellectual acceptance of eugenics as a hopeful and most important study.
[02:24:36.764 --> 02:24:42.388]  Then let its principles work into the heart of the nation who will gradually give practical effect to them
[02:24:42.928 --> 02:24:43.788]  We're good to go.
[02:25:06.034 --> 02:25:12.136]  And it becomes population control as opposed to forcible sterilization, although that very much continues.
[02:25:12.156 --> 02:25:17.538]  Sustainability, environmentalism, all these terms, and they get all these good people working for them that have no idea.
[02:25:17.598 --> 02:25:20.819]  Meanwhile, the elite, though, have a penchant for actually hurting the environment.
[02:25:21.271 --> 02:25:22.191]  I mean, these people are nuts.
[02:25:22.231 --> 02:25:29.175]  They love genetic engineering, toxic waste dumping, all these bad things they do, and then they're simultaneously, though, saying they're doing it for the Earth.
[02:25:29.495 --> 02:25:32.636]  Ah, but it's all these mouths to feed that are causing all the problems.
[02:25:33.116 --> 02:25:40.420]  I actually pulled up a document today from the UNESCO publication, I think the year was 1974, and the big headline was 1 plus 1 equals 3.
[02:25:40.460 --> 02:25:41.780]  200,000 new mouths to feed every day.
[02:25:47.643 --> 02:25:59.242]  And it's all about how we need to control... And now we found their documents where it's really about not letting Africa and Asia, but mainly Africa, develop and these people starving to death because of it, because of environmental policies.
[02:26:00.109 --> 02:26:05.932]  Yeah, in fact, forcible sterilization continued in the United States for a long time.
[02:26:05.972 --> 02:26:11.695]  In some states, even until the 80s, and other Western nations continued through the mid-70s and even later.
[02:26:11.715 --> 02:26:18.979]  And you discover, it's still going on right now, bigger than ever, when you talk to yuppies or liberals or even conservatives, people who have been universally studied, they don't know why.
[02:26:18.999 --> 02:26:20.540]  They go, well, shouldn't we reduce?
[02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:21.300]  Shouldn't we sterilize?
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:21.881]  You know, it's hard.
[02:26:22.621 --> 02:26:26.225]  Sounds mean, but I'm intellectual enough to make the hard decision.
[02:26:26.545 --> 02:26:29.628]  I mean, so many of you listening, this is what was discussed.
[02:26:29.989 --> 02:26:38.918]  I remember going to college, it didn't matter if it was algebra, it didn't matter if it was sociology, anthropology, psychology, it didn't matter if it was Texas history.
[02:26:38.938 --> 02:26:42.121]  They would just get up in front of the class and say, we must reduce world population.
[02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:46.031]  We must, and this is the religion!
[02:26:46.511 --> 02:26:47.551]  Well, that's the double think.
[02:26:47.611 --> 02:26:57.713]  We've decided that the Nazi regime, the Nazi way of doing things is so horrible, yet we have a science that supposedly justifies literally eliminating the entire third world.
[02:26:57.733 --> 02:26:59.253]  It's like Time Magazine, everybody.
[02:26:59.473 --> 02:27:01.454]  Margaret Sanger loves women and blacks.
[02:27:01.534 --> 02:27:02.574]  Oh, she's so good.
[02:27:02.894 --> 02:27:04.234]  She really stood up for women.
[02:27:04.594 --> 02:27:07.835]  Meanwhile, she's talking about sterilizing women and blacks who are subhuman.
[02:27:08.673 --> 02:27:09.854]  Oh, they love blacks.
[02:27:10.194 --> 02:27:11.334]  Well, that's the religion of it.
[02:27:11.394 --> 02:27:12.295]  Get with the feel.
[02:27:12.915 --> 02:27:14.275]  Uh, the body is a temple.
[02:27:14.315 --> 02:27:18.037]  You know, we have to cut out the, uh, the negative aspects of our population.
[02:27:18.657 --> 02:27:21.619]  That's how we're going to, uh, attain the heavenliness.
[02:27:21.839 --> 02:27:24.240]  Oh, Margaret Sanger's so liberal.
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:29.222]  Meanwhile, I mean, if you were us and we were talking about killing all the blacks, we'd be Nazis, but not her.
[02:27:29.522 --> 02:27:30.982]  No, no, no, it's liberal.
[02:27:31.423 --> 02:27:32.843]  Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
[02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:34.664]  We're on the march.
[02:27:35.124 --> 02:27:36.665]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.649 --> 02:27:40.333]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.268 --> 02:27:47.850]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[02:27:48.250 --> 02:27:51.172]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[02:27:51.492 --> 02:27:54.073]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[02:27:54.433 --> 02:27:59.255]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[02:27:59.635 --> 02:28:04.998]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[02:28:05.298 --> 02:28:08.259]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[02:28:08.459 --> 02:28:09.019]  We're good to go.
[02:28:31.847 --> 02:28:32.087]  We're good.
[02:28:43.743 --> 02:28:45.464]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:28:45.604 --> 02:28:46.945]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:28:47.105 --> 02:28:49.927]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:28:50.288 --> 02:28:53.050]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:28:53.590 --> 02:29:00.335]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:29:49.165 --> 02:29:57.007]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues too.
[02:29:57.488 --> 02:30:02.809]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts,
[02:30:03.584 --> 02:30:09.587]  Now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[02:30:09.667 --> 02:30:10.167]  Central.
[02:30:10.547 --> 02:30:16.890]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated but never duplicated.
[02:30:17.629 --> 02:30:23.955]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[02:30:24.495 --> 02:30:29.580]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[02:30:30.340 --> 02:30:35.845]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[02:30:36.226 --> 02:30:37.607]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[02:30:37.687 --> 02:30:39.749]  Central with The Divided Kingdom.
[02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:50.873]  They railed against the crown.
[02:30:51.953 --> 02:30:53.735]  They railed against the crown.
[02:30:55.496 --> 02:31:01.860]  Another ragtag band declaring independence.
[02:31:02.020 --> 02:31:04.942]  They laid their bodies down.
[02:31:05.002 --> 02:31:06.623]  They laid their bodies down.
[02:31:07.589 --> 02:31:09.890]  I salute the renegades!
[02:31:11.111 --> 02:31:12.111]  And the lives they lead!
[02:31:12.612 --> 02:31:13.892]  Far ahead of...
[02:31:44.668 --> 02:31:46.128]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:47.089 --> 02:31:48.949]  When it comes to heroes, Renegades are mine.
[02:31:48.969 --> 02:31:50.970]  We're about to get back into the future of eugenics.
[02:31:51.290 --> 02:31:52.210]  The current and future.
[02:31:53.371 --> 02:31:58.192]  But first off, ladies and gentlemen, bad nutrition is a breeding ground for illness due to stress and anxiety.
[02:31:58.212 --> 02:32:01.113]  And I'm telling you, you need to get the best green food out there.
[02:32:01.333 --> 02:32:03.153]  Aaron, you took it just this morning, didn't you?
[02:32:03.674 --> 02:32:04.614]  As a matter of fact, I did.
[02:32:04.634 --> 02:32:06.254]  And you're losing weight big time, by the way.
[02:32:06.274 --> 02:32:10.335]  And again, it doesn't have a bunch of stuff to speed you up so you don't eat.
[02:32:10.356 --> 02:32:11.796]  It just has all the nutrients so you're not hungry.
[02:32:12.435 --> 02:32:12.655]  Yes, sir.
[02:32:27.688 --> 02:32:30.050]  The free supply we've got, he's imbibing in it.
[02:32:30.451 --> 02:32:40.561]  The point is, give him a call at 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, or enerfood.com, enterfood.com, or 1-866-762-9238.
[02:32:40.581 --> 02:32:45.025]  We've got a lot of other great products there as well, be sure and check them out.
[02:32:45.346 --> 02:32:50.671]  There's also 84 different types of minerals in ionic form, in chelicine from blacklisted herb.
[02:32:50.691 --> 02:32:51.572]  They've got a lot of the
[02:32:52.152 --> 02:32:56.976]  Really interesting stuff on their side and this stuff comes from the mountains of Tibet and Nepal.
[02:32:57.036 --> 02:33:00.719]  It is a mineral deposit that gives you a lot of trace minerals.
[02:33:00.739 --> 02:33:10.147]  You need a very important mineral to take and get the stuff out of the mountains or out of the sea and this is a particularly powerful stuff and they got a deal where it's free to try.
[02:33:10.947 --> 02:33:11.228]  Buy that.
[02:33:11.248 --> 02:33:12.909]  If you don't like it, you can just mail it back.
[02:33:13.533 --> 02:33:16.696]  But this isn't where you give them your credit card and you get a call and get them to reverse that.
[02:33:17.237 --> 02:33:17.417]  No.
[02:33:17.697 --> 02:33:18.678]  There's no credit card number.
[02:33:18.738 --> 02:33:19.198]  No nothing.
[02:33:19.559 --> 02:33:20.299]  It's free to try.
[02:33:20.760 --> 02:33:23.122]  If you don't like it, you just mail it back.
[02:33:23.142 --> 02:33:24.403]  Or you don't have to mail it back.
[02:33:24.443 --> 02:33:25.825]  You just don't pay the first invoice.
[02:33:25.865 --> 02:33:28.607]  And when you want to order second, you pay with the first invoice.
[02:33:28.647 --> 02:33:30.209]  So, it's a great deal.
[02:33:31.209 --> 02:33:35.231]  Let's get your name and number, your address, where to mail it to, with an invoice.
[02:33:35.291 --> 02:33:37.531]  And if you want more, you order more and pay for the first invoice.
[02:33:37.932 --> 02:33:42.013]  Give blacklistedherb.com a call at 877-327-0365.
[02:33:42.033 --> 02:33:50.296]  It's Solutions from Science, blacklistedherb.com, 877-327-0365.
[02:33:50.696 --> 02:33:53.957]  And I really haven't plugged them all day because I've been too busy ranting and raving about the news.
[02:33:54.398 --> 02:33:55.078]  Here's the plug.
[02:33:55.814 --> 02:33:58.196]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.tv right now.
[02:33:59.176 --> 02:34:00.237]  17 minutes of added footage.
[02:34:00.257 --> 02:34:00.237]  17!
[02:34:00.758 --> 02:34:02.119]  That's a mini-film right there.
[02:34:02.439 --> 02:34:06.442]  On 7-7, 9-11, the BBC reporting on 7 falling before it did.
[02:34:06.842 --> 02:34:11.025]  So much more in the new Terror Storm Final Cut Special Edition.
[02:34:11.585 --> 02:34:14.788]  The whole thing's been remastered, new video added, new audio throughout.
[02:34:15.569 --> 02:34:17.571]  It's just a lot stronger film now.
[02:34:18.011 --> 02:34:24.337]  Available on DVD, now shipping it out to you at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:34:24.357 --> 02:34:26.279]  You can call and get your DVD out of it within over an hour.
[02:34:31.063 --> 02:34:32.304]  We're good to go.
[02:34:54.037 --> 02:34:56.740]  Uh, right now we have three up and there'll be more on the way.
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:35:00.123]  Okay, so there's a bunch of different varieties and whatever you want up there.
[02:35:00.523 --> 02:35:02.365]  And Aaron's the guy doing that too, so he knows all about it.
[02:35:03.586 --> 02:35:04.527]  You have done well.
[02:35:05.087 --> 02:35:11.333]  Anyways, uh, we, uh, I already told you, we're not, I'm making this resolution, we're not working as hard after Endgame comes out.
[02:35:11.934 --> 02:35:14.937]  We're gonna cut back to eight hours a day for a few months, be like a vacation.
[02:35:16.378 --> 02:35:18.800]  But anyways, it's all up on PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[02:35:20.074 --> 02:35:22.725]  And you can go there and download it and burn it to dust and get it out of people that way.
[02:35:22.765 --> 02:35:24.371]  I mean, I just want this film to get out to people.
[02:35:24.907 --> 02:35:25.727]  That is the goal here.
[02:35:26.347 --> 02:35:28.468]  Aaron, my friend, you have the floor now.
[02:35:28.488 --> 02:35:29.728]  We've got about 25 minutes left.
[02:35:29.768 --> 02:35:35.810]  Let's go through some more of how the environmental movement, the one-child policy, China's under it.
[02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:36.871]  Now they want that here.
[02:35:36.931 --> 02:35:39.491]  Now they're announcing, oh, a tax on two children.
[02:35:39.571 --> 02:35:40.532]  That's one child.
[02:35:40.852 --> 02:35:42.932]  All these groups announcing you should only have one child.
[02:35:43.252 --> 02:35:46.193]  We need to reduce the population to 1 billion, 500 million, Ted Turner.
[02:35:46.413 --> 02:35:47.634]  They're all saying it now.
[02:35:47.914 --> 02:35:51.475]  This is their, we've got now the state of Texas last year,
[02:35:52.267 --> 02:35:53.127]  We're going to put this in the film.
[02:35:53.728 --> 02:35:54.748]  We don't just have the AP article.
[02:35:54.768 --> 02:35:55.689]  We went and got the video.
[02:35:55.709 --> 02:35:56.369]  Thanks, Dr. Breeding.
[02:35:56.769 --> 02:36:04.874]  Where they're sitting there saying, well, the state's psychiatrists, well, we're putting more than two-thirds of the kids on drugs because they come from a bad gene pool.
[02:36:05.414 --> 02:36:07.375]  Of course, no science, no tests, no dishes.
[02:36:07.555 --> 02:36:11.057]  We're putting you on deadly drugs because we say you're a bad gene pool.
[02:36:11.438 --> 02:36:17.961]  Aaron, walk us through the last bit of history, then the present, and then let's get into transhumanists.
[02:36:20.083 --> 02:36:32.549]  Yeah Alex, all this stuff is so scary and even normal people, by normal I mean not informed, glued into the television, not paying attention to things, know how scary some of these privacy things are.
[02:36:32.909 --> 02:36:34.270]  And they're only accelerating.
[02:36:34.330 --> 02:36:41.654]  Now we have Tony Blair just left office looking for antisocial behavior disorders in babies.
[02:36:42.454 --> 02:36:46.195]  The pre-screening baby is going to tell you which babies can be born and not.
[02:36:46.595 --> 02:36:57.059]  And even though the social workers, the same that were founded in England for sterilization and eugenics, are now fully realizing the dream of eugenics, actually prenatally in the womb they're watching the babies.
[02:36:57.219 --> 02:36:57.439]  Go ahead.
[02:36:58.129 --> 02:37:09.253]  We're at this phase and it's absolutely nightmarish, but at the same time we're faced with another utopian dilemma, another chance to buy into the new utopia.
[02:37:10.253 --> 02:37:10.713]  And why?
[02:37:10.733 --> 02:37:11.694]  The question is why.
[02:37:11.774 --> 02:37:12.934]  Why because we could.
[02:37:12.994 --> 02:37:14.715]  Why because we discovered something new.
[02:37:14.955 --> 02:37:18.316]  They brought you the world wars.
[02:37:18.336 --> 02:37:19.356]  They brought you Hitler.
[02:37:19.576 --> 02:37:21.057]  They brought you all sorts of nightmares.
[02:37:21.097 --> 02:37:22.377]  Now they're bringing you something new.
[02:37:22.738 --> 02:37:23.618]  Will you embrace it?
[02:37:23.738 --> 02:37:23.998]  Go ahead.
[02:37:24.708 --> 02:37:28.310]  As soon as you discover how to split the atom, we immediately create a bomb out of it.
[02:37:28.650 --> 02:37:36.214]  As soon as you rediscover Mendel's theory and have the slightest clue of heredity that you actually can't control yet, you immediately launch eugenics.
[02:37:36.634 --> 02:37:51.762]  And now, as soon as genetics heats up and more things become possible, immediately we talk about transcending the human body into a new age, a spiritual age of data, and there's all kinds of... It's really a total bondage.
[02:37:51.862 --> 02:37:52.582]  Total bondage.
[02:37:53.411 --> 02:37:53.771]  It is.
[02:37:55.132 --> 02:38:02.574]  We're talking about people like Francis Fukuyama, talking about the end of history and the beginning of a new age in spiritual.
[02:38:02.594 --> 02:38:06.096]  We're talking about Ray Kurzweil, age of spiritual machines.
[02:38:06.196 --> 02:38:09.057]  Ray Kurzweil, can you live long enough to live forever?
[02:38:09.097 --> 02:38:11.938]  And if you've read 20 eugenics books, you read it and you go, it's the same stuff!
[02:38:12.498 --> 02:38:13.579]  They just changed the labels.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:19.086]  Yeah, it's the promotion of this great myth of how humanity is going to live forever and transcend.
[02:38:19.106 --> 02:38:28.776]  But when you read their actual, when Bill Joy went to one of their meetings with 214 members of the technocracy, he described it in 2000, April issue of Wired Magazine.
[02:38:28.797 --> 02:38:31.620]  This is a guy, back then he was worth $4 billion, we looked him up, I don't know about him now.
[02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:32.540]  I think so.
[02:38:53.366 --> 02:39:01.349]  If you're going to be one of these who live forever, it's going to be a money thing, it's going to be a technology thing, and basically the third world hasn't got a prayer.
[02:39:01.709 --> 02:39:04.591]  Most of us in the United States... See, I put that in Rotaterra and people laughed at me.
[02:39:04.631 --> 02:39:05.711]  This is all they talk about.
[02:39:06.218 --> 02:39:19.667]  There's probably, what, 50, 60, 70 books we saw scanning in the last few days with all the top elite about, you know, we've got to get rid of the third world, only elites can have the life extension, what's going to happen when the public finds out we've got this?
[02:39:20.107 --> 02:39:23.830]  Because they know you don't read books, folks, so they're openly talking about you.
[02:39:24.190 --> 02:39:26.031]  They have now got this stuff.
[02:39:26.291 --> 02:39:28.953]  They're saying if you're 40 years old right now, folks, you ain't going to die.
[02:39:29.876 --> 02:39:34.282]  Now, regardless if you believe in that or not, or if it's real, they can certainly extend it greatly.
[02:39:34.542 --> 02:39:35.563]  They don't want you to have access.
[02:39:35.603 --> 02:39:41.530]  And the point is, they believe it, and they're racing for a world government so they can have the monopoly of the life extension.
[02:39:41.711 --> 02:39:44.895]  It's still a question of Pandora's box and why do it.
[02:39:45.375 --> 02:39:49.200]  Even if it is possible to live forever, it's going to require calling out
[02:39:49.998 --> 02:39:57.688]  As you draw in the nets, you're going to cull out the vast majority of people, and only the elites are going to be, if this is even true, will be the ones to take the lead.
[02:39:57.728 --> 02:40:03.015]  I mean, really, it's just a fusion of whatever's left in the biological memories into a supercomputer.
[02:40:03.436 --> 02:40:05.579]  And so it'll be a new species, that's actually true.
[02:40:06.279 --> 02:40:17.892]  Uh, but, uh, the point is, is that, is, is that the elite that's shown they're totally bloodthirsty and can care less about any... See, so many of you out there who have degrees, are pretty smart, you make $100,000, $300,000 a year, you think you're a member of the elite.
[02:40:17.912 --> 02:40:19.033]  Let me give you a newsflash, you're not.
[02:40:19.293 --> 02:40:23.238]  And so you hear this, you go, oh, well that, you know, that makes sense, the elite will have access.
[02:40:23.818 --> 02:40:26.300]  Do you understand, folks, you're not going to be cut into this.
[02:40:26.501 --> 02:40:38.131]  A. B. The elite that have raced to now be at the penultimate point of actually in grasp of this are a bunch of inbred scum who I don't think deserve to carry the mantle of humanity to the stars.
[02:40:38.511 --> 02:40:38.752]  Aaron?
[02:40:39.072 --> 02:40:44.797]  Ray Kurzweil has already war-gamed out that the creation of nanotechnology is only going to lead to new problems.
[02:40:44.817 --> 02:40:47.219]  It's going to lead to nanotechnology wars.
[02:40:47.239 --> 02:40:49.641]  It's going to lead to a takeover by nanobots.
[02:40:49.661 --> 02:40:49.942]  We'll be
[02:40:50.820 --> 02:40:54.843]  Slaves to nano-creatures, little tiny particles inside of us.
[02:40:54.883 --> 02:40:57.044]  Why shouldn't we control destiny and not allow this?
[02:40:57.825 --> 02:41:00.547]  Why shouldn't we strictly control this?
[02:41:00.867 --> 02:41:05.670]  Because then people will argue, oh see, that's what the elite would actually have people like you out there to say that and bring it under control.
[02:41:05.710 --> 02:41:14.737]  No, I mean total transparency, publicly have a national, international, global debate about this, and then have serious, strict, open control.
[02:41:14.757 --> 02:41:18.239]  See, only total openness can stop this, but they're actually going in the opposite direction.
[02:41:18.479 --> 02:41:19.780]  Oh, but they're not hiding, Alex.
[02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:21.562]  They always present the moral argument.
[02:41:21.902 --> 02:41:22.883]  There could be issues.
[02:41:22.943 --> 02:41:25.965]  But then they say there is no morals.
[02:41:26.186 --> 02:41:41.819]  Morals aside, I want what humans are to slowly develop and to move forward, and not to radically, dangerously bring in things that most of the statisticians say will have a probability of destroying us, and then they bring in a thousand developments
[02:41:42.199 --> 02:41:45.901]  Which are going to be doubling every two minutes, and then every five seconds, and then every second.
[02:41:46.182 --> 02:41:49.784]  I mean, we don't need to bring this in, which is guaranteed to destroy us.
[02:41:50.264 --> 02:41:52.746]  Alex, it's just like the eugenics from a hundred years ago.
[02:41:53.166 --> 02:41:58.069]  They thought they had it nailed immediately, and of course we find out that... They also have over-confidence.
[02:41:58.249 --> 02:41:59.490]  That's not the way it works.
[02:42:00.071 --> 02:42:04.533]  And they're still pursuing the general ideas, when we know they don't know what they're talking about.
[02:42:04.553 --> 02:42:05.294]  Now... Exactly.
[02:42:05.314 --> 02:42:09.737]  They're integrating old false science with just new overlays, with whatever's new.
[02:42:10.457 --> 02:42:26.186]  Because you're going to realize the people running things are 80, 90 years old, like David Rockefeller, they still own the money, they're in control, and they have the advisors and think tanks of certain schools, so we actually have a 80 to 90 to 100 year old model running everything in a hyper-technology explosive development paradigm.
[02:42:26.426 --> 02:42:31.649]  Even if our hidden scientific dictatorship has learned from its mistakes and has corrected itself,
[02:42:32.250 --> 02:42:34.733]  To be on a currently great path.
[02:42:34.773 --> 02:42:37.096]  We have such acceleration of developments.
[02:42:37.537 --> 02:42:38.979]  So many new things to learn about.
[02:42:39.079 --> 02:42:41.262]  And we have humans trying to make a predictability curve.
[02:42:41.302 --> 02:42:42.484]  We can't even adjust to it now.
[02:42:43.005 --> 02:42:43.345]  I'm sorry.
[02:42:43.365 --> 02:42:44.206]  It already may be too late.
[02:42:44.226 --> 02:42:44.627]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:45.211 --> 02:42:48.592]  Well, not at all, but we have so many new developments, how can we ever commit to them?
[02:42:48.632 --> 02:42:52.034]  We haven't got a clue if they really pan out the way they think we do.
[02:42:52.254 --> 02:43:05.379]  And it's a bunch of chicken-necked little wines, and I'm not saying we're bringing wines back, you know what I mean, wine slurpers who think it's elegant to drink wine, stumbling around at Nature Conservancy meetings going, we'll soon deal with them, oh yes, hmm, how's your properties doing?
[02:43:05.399 --> 02:43:08.100]  I mean, these people are not even that hard-working either, we've discovered.
[02:43:08.700 --> 02:43:09.140]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:10.764 --> 02:43:18.714]  I want to count on that example with James Watson, who has been working very hard in genetics, again, doing his research.
[02:43:18.774 --> 02:43:21.737]  Former head of the whole eugenics office building, yeah.
[02:43:21.817 --> 02:43:25.562]  His entire operation is still at the Cold Springs Harbor, which is where eugenics started.
[02:43:26.753 --> 02:43:31.275]  And he has a quote here, you know, kind of targeted at our niche of people.
[02:43:31.455 --> 02:43:51.643]  He's talking about such individuals who believe that genetically impaired fetuses have as much right to exist as those destined for healthy, productive lives, quote, but such arguments present no validity to those of us who see no evidence for the sanctity of life, believing instead that human as well as other forms of life are the products
[02:43:52.123 --> 02:43:55.905]  Not of God's hand, but of the evolutionary process operating under Darwin.
[02:43:56.686 --> 02:43:58.027]  And that's fine and good.
[02:43:58.047 --> 02:43:59.267]  He's going to reject God.
[02:44:00.688 --> 02:44:16.117]  But he goes further to take away our human rights inherent under the Constitution by saying, that's not to say humans don't have rights, but the rights don't come from God, but instead from social contracts among humans who realize that human societies must operate under rules
[02:44:16.517 --> 02:44:19.878]  They'll offer stability and predictability in day-to-day existence.
[02:44:20.139 --> 02:44:20.879]  Elite monopoly.
[02:44:20.919 --> 02:44:26.281]  Where's that sick quote where he says that we don't have any right to life, so they can go ahead and engineer us or kill us?
[02:44:26.661 --> 02:44:27.762]  Where he says there's no sanctity.
[02:44:27.782 --> 02:44:28.722]  That was a really evil one.
[02:44:29.362 --> 02:44:40.827]  Yeah, he says there's no sanctity, and in fact the prevailing emotion must be largely one of relief at not having to be called to give love and support to an infant who can never lead a normal life, he goes on to say.
[02:44:42.548 --> 02:44:46.049]  But once you go over that slope, and he even says he calls it a slippery slope, it's over.
[02:44:46.909 --> 02:44:49.110]  Once you start saying we can just kill people, folks, it's over.
[02:44:49.390 --> 02:44:50.591]  Well, that's another quote he has.
[02:44:50.631 --> 02:44:58.235]  He says, once you have the ability to pre-screen fetuses, just as an example of the many things going on in genetics, you can never stop.
[02:44:58.935 --> 02:44:59.575]  That's his idea.
[02:44:59.615 --> 02:45:01.116]  You can't stop once you've discovered it.
[02:45:01.416 --> 02:45:03.517]  Well, I mean, let's get into the future.
[02:45:03.898 --> 02:45:08.580]  What they're setting up, what they're saying, what their agenda is right now, with the global warming movement as its front.
[02:45:10.376 --> 02:45:21.370]  Well, we're going to buy into this global warming idea as a reason to cut back on humanity itself, not just our patterns of consumption, but the numbers of humans.
[02:45:22.279 --> 02:45:32.782]  And people who want to feel good and buy into global warming are totally ignoring the calling off of the third world that they believe is necessary to get us back down to quote, sustainable numbers.
[02:45:33.262 --> 02:45:41.264]  Well, what I found with intellectuals, pseudo-intellectuals, which are the dominant breed, is that they get one idea and they fixate on it.
[02:45:41.284 --> 02:45:50.326]  They lock in on that one idea, and then it's that theory, that idea, and then they make everything in the world and all their research conform and comply to that.
[02:45:51.121 --> 02:45:54.182]  Instead, in my studies, I've always found that it's actually a little mix of everything.
[02:45:54.482 --> 02:46:06.145]  A lot of theories have a lot of basis in reality, but the universe is so complex and varied and diverse that it's a much more complex tapestry than just that.
[02:46:06.325 --> 02:46:12.727]  And when I read by Kurzweil and Joy and literally hundreds of these top people, billionaires,
[02:46:13.576 --> 02:46:19.997]  This is all they talk about, and they say, robotics, development, nanotech, we're not going to need human populations for manufacturing.
[02:46:20.898 --> 02:46:23.798]  Are we going to give them baubles and entertainment, or are we just going to go ahead and kill everybody?
[02:46:23.858 --> 02:46:26.119]  Humans, and why the future doesn't need us anymore.
[02:46:26.479 --> 02:46:28.119]  Yeah.
[02:46:28.159 --> 02:46:35.121]  That was that particular paper, but they just repeat it, and Joy goes to the meeting, and they're all talking about intriguing him out, because that's where it's going, folks.
[02:46:35.141 --> 02:46:40.422]  They're saying, wow, see, we always wanted to kill everybody anyways, and now it makes sense, we don't even need them.
[02:46:40.802 --> 02:46:42.022]  You see, I mean, it's like our economy.
[02:46:43.115 --> 02:46:48.848]  Close to 80% of all the federal, state, and county, city, water district, school district money has been invested in offshore corporations.
[02:46:48.908 --> 02:46:52.576]  None of it goes to pay for teachers, or pensions, or schools, or paint, or kids.
[02:46:53.866 --> 02:46:56.448]  And now, in just the next few years, it'll be close to 100%.
[02:46:56.628 --> 02:46:59.329]  See, they don't even need your tax money anymore.
[02:46:59.369 --> 02:47:01.491]  They've sucked everything out of us.
[02:47:01.551 --> 02:47:07.734]  Now they're just grabbing up the parks, the infrastructure, the power plants, the oceans, the rivers, and they're militarizing the police against us.
[02:47:08.215 --> 02:47:09.135]  And, I mean, you can see it.
[02:47:09.175 --> 02:47:12.097]  The free market system was not really free market.
[02:47:12.137 --> 02:47:14.799]  It was a banking fraud to get everybody into debt.
[02:47:15.199 --> 02:47:16.620]  Now they've fully got us into debt.
[02:47:16.660 --> 02:47:20.102]  Now the police state comes in in the next phase, and then it's the controlled culling.
[02:47:21.189 --> 02:47:28.411]  And lo and behold, I just organically saw their... See, nothing's really secret, because you can have a secret meeting at the New World Order level, but then you've got to implement it.
[02:47:28.691 --> 02:47:38.214]  And then I could see the different pieces and see the implementation, you know, basically in a unified field theory of the political and sociological system, just from studying enough data points.
[02:47:38.654 --> 02:47:43.796]  Then, to learn that they actually wrote it all down, and they're using exact terms that I organically used,
[02:47:44.396 --> 02:47:46.877]  Again, it shows me, man, we are in deep trouble, folks.
[02:47:47.157 --> 02:47:48.418]  And they're actually saying it.
[02:47:48.438 --> 02:47:52.060]  Aaron, from your study, how long do you think it will take until they release the first mega-plagues?
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:57.982]  I think they're going to release smaller plagues in controlled fashion to condition us to be under stricter control, and then mega-plagues after that.
[02:47:58.262 --> 02:48:01.163]  But I think we could be as close as only 10 years away from mega-plagues.
[02:48:02.164 --> 02:48:03.264]  The technology is there.
[02:48:03.304 --> 02:48:05.425]  I don't know when they plan to implement it.
[02:48:06.506 --> 02:48:07.726]  But I know they want us gone.
[02:48:08.167 --> 02:48:10.448]  We're not going to fit into the long-term scheme.
[02:48:10.468 --> 02:48:12.148]  By mega-plagues, I mean millions dead, folks.
[02:48:12.368 --> 02:48:13.549]  The first few will be millions dead.
[02:48:15.248 --> 02:48:17.850]  Well, as soon as they make Africa happen, that's the first spot.
[02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:18.791]  They've already run that off.
[02:48:18.831 --> 02:48:23.314]  They've got some countries, half the population's already died of one of the cocktail diseases.
[02:48:23.694 --> 02:48:26.476]  They've had international studies by other private groups that go, we don't understand.
[02:48:26.896 --> 02:48:32.480]  Children of women that never had, you know, children that never had sex or women that only had one partner have got AIDS.
[02:48:33.201 --> 02:48:36.303]  And, of course, they found the needles have been specially encapsulated in them.
[02:48:36.323 --> 02:48:38.304]  But that was, of course, an all in big accident.
[02:48:38.764 --> 02:48:39.405]  Oh, they're right back.
[02:48:46.500 --> 02:48:49.663]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:50.044 --> 02:48:51.966]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:52.326 --> 02:48:59.974]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:00.672 --> 02:49:07.715]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:08.115 --> 02:49:19.540]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:19.860 --> 02:49:23.342]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:23.822 --> 02:49:25.783]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:26.083 --> 02:49:29.925]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:43.604 --> 02:49:48.569]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:49:48.869 --> 02:49:54.314]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:49:54.354 --> 02:49:58.638]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[02:49:58.978 --> 02:50:02.000]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:50:02.321 --> 02:50:05.744]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[02:50:06.064 --> 02:50:15.410]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:19.173]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:19.413 --> 02:50:26.538]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:50:40.608 --> 02:50:50.556]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself so that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[02:50:51.076 --> 02:50:53.458]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[02:50:53.938 --> 02:51:01.605]  Now there's Night Skin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[02:51:02.185 --> 02:51:08.773]  Night Skin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[02:51:09.233 --> 02:51:16.722]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage, all while you get a good night's sleep.

[02:51:50.858 --> 02:51:53.960]  We are definitely riding the storm.
[02:51:54.180 --> 02:51:55.981]  Into this world we're born.
[02:51:56.001 --> 02:52:00.664]  Final segment I'll be live on the radio Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:52:00.764 --> 02:52:03.166]  Central, time 5 to 7 Eastern, 2 to 4.
[02:52:14.966 --> 02:52:15.686]  We're good to go!
[02:52:40.853 --> 02:52:48.339]  And we restream the show 21 hours a day as well on the weekend 24 hours a day Friday show you can hear again on Saturday at InfoWars.com.
[02:52:48.379 --> 02:52:58.967]  Remember, we grow, we reach people, we're able to fight these monsters and maybe some small chance, well we can certainly win with God's help, but no chance without God to beat this new world order.
[02:53:01.229 --> 02:53:06.213]  Aaron Dyche, in closing here, anything other key tidbits?
[02:53:06.233 --> 02:53:07.254]  There's so much here.
[02:53:08.314 --> 02:53:13.358]  Alex, the new eugenics is not going to be what we saw in the past century.
[02:53:13.418 --> 02:53:20.764]  The new eugenics is going to be screening your babies for genetic markers, and if it doesn't meet the cut, negative eugenics are gone.
[02:53:21.445 --> 02:53:23.427]  So it is going to be negative and positive eugenics.
[02:53:23.467 --> 02:53:25.008]  And they're already pressuring people.
[02:53:25.648 --> 02:53:26.829]  In fact, I was just reading a study.
[02:53:28.190 --> 02:53:32.314]  Two-thirds of the time when they tell a woman they think the baby's got Down syndrome, it doesn't really.
[02:53:33.176 --> 02:53:34.137]  You see, but go ahead.
[02:53:34.277 --> 02:53:35.918]  But that's just going to be for the plebes.
[02:53:35.938 --> 02:53:38.139]  That's the new negative eugenics for the plebes.
[02:53:38.179 --> 02:53:40.721]  If you don't make the cut, your baby's not going to be alive.
[02:53:40.741 --> 02:53:42.622]  But the elite's going to get the extra therapy.
[02:53:42.722 --> 02:53:44.443]  It's going to be a new certification.
[02:53:44.483 --> 02:53:52.108]  If you don't get the life extension, if you can't pay for memory implants, if you can't pay to have the genetic markers.
[02:53:52.148 --> 02:53:53.429]  And it's going to be a status thing.
[02:53:53.929 --> 02:53:55.550]  They're going to have rock stars getting it.
[02:53:55.990 --> 02:53:56.430]  See everybody?
[02:53:56.450 --> 02:53:57.891]  Oh my gosh, I wish I could have it.
[02:53:58.271 --> 02:54:01.213]  Oh look, American Idol Season 24.
[02:54:02.034 --> 02:54:03.154]  They got awards with it.
[02:54:03.654 --> 02:54:04.675]  They got the prize.
[02:54:04.835 --> 02:54:06.416]  Full augmentation!
[02:54:06.976 --> 02:54:19.003]  It's going to be status of augmentation and just like films like Gattaca, that stratification, that part of society is going to be a new Nazi breed of if you don't strive to a particular image of perfection,
[02:54:19.863 --> 02:54:35.389]  You can't compete, and you can't really... And they're already saying that, well, if you want a job in defense or anywhere else, like the Mexican Attorney General making them get chips or Special Forces having to get them, oh, well, you don't have to have it, but then, yeah, you gotta have it because a terrorist, well, because of the threat, and, you know, kind of like we're on their show, those people, they don't want it.
[02:54:36.920 --> 02:54:43.842]  Yeah, and Kurzweil also talks about the kind of new bio-plagues, the data plagues, the nanobot plagues.
[02:54:44.302 --> 02:54:52.204]  There's all sorts of monstrous things that face us, even if we are allowed into this new digital age of, you know... Well, let's be clear.
[02:54:52.384 --> 02:55:02.166]  They've already, for hundreds of years, kept their technology advance, their mysteries, their secrets, in kind of technological spires that are above the general architecture and landscape.
[02:55:02.745 --> 02:55:04.487]  So they're at least 20-30 years ahead.
[02:55:04.527 --> 02:55:07.630]  That's what we know of in technological spires right now.
[02:55:07.650 --> 02:55:19.701]  With technology doubling in data storage every year now, it's gone every two years, and with other general technologies doubling every three years on average, they probably have hyper-warped to technological levels we might not even be able to comprehend at this point.
[02:55:20.707 --> 02:55:21.348]  Yeah, things do work.
[02:55:21.368 --> 02:55:23.189]  I think that's why there's the arrogance now, yeah.
[02:55:23.790 --> 02:55:25.351]  Things work incriminately like that.
[02:55:25.431 --> 02:55:28.854]  You can also play it off of H.G.
[02:55:28.894 --> 02:55:33.298]  Wells predicting the atom bomb in 1915, not used until 1945.
[02:55:33.918 --> 02:55:35.179]  Big coincidence there.
[02:55:35.540 --> 02:55:40.484]  Brave New World, 1932, those kind of things only becoming public now.
[02:55:41.465 --> 02:55:47.710]  And what they're telling us now through Kurzweil and others may only be just the tip of the horrible new iceberg.
[02:55:48.604 --> 02:55:51.399]  Just what they admit is enough to have them all indicted and arrested.
[02:55:52.165 --> 02:55:53.566]  I mean, it's bad.
[02:55:53.606 --> 02:55:55.968]  But it's just... Well, good job, Aaron.
[02:55:56.008 --> 02:55:56.488]  Part 3.
[02:55:56.809 --> 02:56:05.355]  When Endgame's done, I'm going to have you back in for maybe a two-hour show where we just, with notes, maybe even clips from the film, walk absolutely through the whole system.
[02:56:05.575 --> 02:56:08.597]  Now, Endgame's about Bilderberg, about the international banking system, the highways.
[02:56:09.158 --> 02:56:11.980]  You know, the first two-thirds of the film give you their infrastructure.
[02:56:12.240 --> 02:56:15.623]  And then we give you the coup de grace, that they're coming for you and your family.
[02:56:15.643 --> 02:56:16.363]  They're coming for me.
[02:56:16.603 --> 02:56:17.624]  They're coming for my family.
[02:56:18.104 --> 02:56:19.325]  It's Mortal Kombat.
