[00:00:05.524 --> 00:00:06.165]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:07.886]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.587 --> 00:00:09.708]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.348 --> 00:00:11.169]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:13.831]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:17.174]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.674 --> 00:00:21.757]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.142 --> 00:00:38.564]  I tell you, Ron Paul is really something else.
[00:00:38.945 --> 00:00:39.665]  Great American.
[00:00:41.287 --> 00:00:45.931]  We were just setting him up for the show next week and they were, oh, we'll just have him on July 4th.
[00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.975]  He'll be working on July 4th doing a bunch of radio interviews.
[00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:53.938]  And I said, well, you know what, my family, I never spend enough time with them.
[00:00:54.198 --> 00:00:55.339]  I'm taking off July 4th.
[00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:58.182]  I think we all deserve that holiday.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.003]  I'll have a great rebroadcast for you, but I mean that's just classic Congressman Ron Paul that he will be working on July 4th.
[00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:09.205]  We've got him coming on July 5th next week.
[00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:11.726]  Congressman Ron Paul will be joining us.
[00:01:11.746 --> 00:01:22.951]  We'll also have the aftermath of the Iowa situation where he's been blocked from speaking, but we'll be there basically stealing the spotlight back.
[00:01:24.065 --> 00:01:28.366]  Snatching victory from the jaws of defeat because of the Republican censorship.
[00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:34.508]  Okay, I'm starting the show kind of off in left field, but here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:35.148 --> 00:01:40.670]  It is the 28th day already of June 2007.
[00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.471]  The year will be more than half elapsed now in just a few days.
[00:01:45.791 --> 00:01:46.451]  Unbelievable.
[00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:47.812]  It still feels like 2002 or 2003 to me.
[00:01:49.887 --> 00:01:51.128]  Well, it is Friday.
[00:01:51.188 --> 00:01:52.828]  We are going to have open phones today.
[00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:54.509]  I have a lot of important audio clips.
[00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.830]  We're going to be playing as well.
[00:01:57.931 --> 00:02:00.192]  The toll-free number to join us, Open Lines.
[00:02:00.612 --> 00:02:02.953]  But first-time callers, we'll go to the head of the line.
[00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:05.615]  That way we can have our cake and eat it, too.
[00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:10.857]  Have new callers, but also have folks that don't routinely call, but want to call in as well, and regular callers.
[00:02:10.877 --> 00:02:11.457]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:11.557 --> 00:02:13.518]  If you disagree, though, you even trump first-time callers.
[00:02:13.538 --> 00:02:15.379]  You go to the head of the line.
[00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:25.801]  So it goes, you know, I guess in this new class system, it's generally just open phones, but occasionally I want to give new people a chance to call in.
[00:02:25.821 --> 00:02:27.823]  If you disagree, you can get in first.
[00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:29.624]  Just tell the folks answering the phones.
[00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:32.205]  If you're a first-time caller, you're next.
[00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:37.068]  And if you're a regular caller, I'm sorry, you go in steerage because you've already had a chance to be on many, many times.
[00:02:37.128 --> 00:02:39.349]  We do appreciate your calls as well.
[00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.391]  Just want to give new people a chance to get on board here.
[00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.450]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:53.436]  I want to finish up the El Cenizo clip we never finished yesterday where many towns in Texas fly the Mexican flag.
[00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:56.038]  English is not allowed in court proceedings.
[00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:59.761]  Again, that was in the San Antonio Express News eight years ago.
[00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:03.023]  CNN's done a whitewash of it, but it's still pretty damning.
[00:03:04.457 --> 00:03:12.441]  We also have a report from a MIT scientist about the controlled demolitions of the World Trade Center complex.
[00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:14.262]  We'll be... Tower 1 and 2 and 7.
[00:03:15.123 --> 00:03:17.284]  We'll be going over that today.
[00:03:17.304 --> 00:03:19.425]  I had this four days ago.
[00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:24.028]  My producer pointed it out, and I said, yeah, that's interesting, but it's part of the course police state-wise.
[00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:33.233]  But it's now gotten more attention, and photos have surfaced, taken from camera phones, before the video camera got there.
[00:03:34.676 --> 00:03:59.086]  with video camera on the phone got there the officer with extreme enjoyment for no reason was just going from youth to youth choking them and uh... basically foaming at the mouth like they did little pot-bellied bullies always do that and uh... whereas he got in trouble in school doing that choking little girls and things now they can do it with enjoyment
[00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.111]  I know I'm supposed to sit here and go, I appreciate this officer.
[00:04:03.551 --> 00:04:05.592]  He was fought in Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:07.113 --> 00:04:18.057]  But I'm sorry, a choking 11-year-old girl, choking 12-year-old boys, who are politely sounding like adults, saying, it's a girl.
[00:04:18.597 --> 00:04:19.597]  Why are you doing that?
[00:04:19.657 --> 00:04:20.438]  That's not nice.
[00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:21.538]  Please stop.
[00:04:22.421 --> 00:04:22.741]  Huh?
[00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.082]  You got a problem?
[00:04:24.102 --> 00:04:30.027]  He runs over and starts grabbing other people and slamming them down going, I'm an officer!
[00:04:30.047 --> 00:04:31.989]  You're actually going to hear that.
[00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:34.030]  That imitation I always do.
[00:04:35.612 --> 00:04:38.053]  I got an IQ of 75!
[00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:39.535]  I got a gun!
[00:04:39.995 --> 00:04:41.836]  We're going to kill this country!
[00:04:41.957 --> 00:04:42.877]  Yeah!
[00:04:42.897 --> 00:04:44.479]  Alright!
[00:04:44.679 --> 00:04:48.642]  You guys will be chanting death to America.
[00:04:51.477 --> 00:04:52.818]  Alright, when we get back, we'll get into all that.
[00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:57.539]  We got Ron Paul on Fox News yesterday with Cavuto, talking about the Brown family.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.280]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:07.463]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:05:07.843 --> 00:05:09.784]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:05:10.144 --> 00:05:17.787]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.487 --> 00:05:25.529]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:37.353]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.673 --> 00:05:41.175]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.615 --> 00:05:43.575]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.896 --> 00:05:47.757]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:09.378]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:07:09.678 --> 00:07:15.000]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:16.461]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:25.968]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[00:08:01.904 --> 00:08:04.085]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:07.426]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:09.998 --> 00:08:22.167]  Alright, we're going to be getting back into the complete amnesty bill, the treason bill, and the open assault on talk radio.
[00:08:23.088 --> 00:08:26.050]  The war drums beating loudly as well as on the internet.
[00:08:26.791 --> 00:08:32.035]  Every form, every avenue of free speech under attack.
[00:08:32.235 --> 00:08:35.958]  From the churches and their free speech right down to the internet.
[00:08:36.636 --> 00:08:37.276]  And talk radio.
[00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.116]  I want to go over that.
[00:08:38.136 --> 00:08:46.759]  I've got a lot of science and financial technology news that's been building up all week and a lot of new developments today that I've absolutely got to get to.
[00:08:47.539 --> 00:08:52.601]  We're also going to have open phones at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:59.082]  But last night I was up here watching footage from our Perry protest a few weeks ago that I'm going to put in the endgame.
[00:08:59.102 --> 00:09:00.983]  In fact, that's how we end the film.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:09.243]  And I wasn't going to put it in the film, I haven't even put it on YouTube yet because frankly we don't have some score to settle with local police.
[00:09:10.844 --> 00:09:18.667]  We're about getting our mission done fighting the globalists, but I'm just tempted to put it in the extras because we've got good audio of it.
[00:09:20.228 --> 00:09:24.990]  Of this police sergeant coming over.
[00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:30.573]  I don't know what the designation is when it's the three stripes
[00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:36.401]  I don't know what type of sergeant that is in the Austin Police Department, but this sergeant comes over.
[00:09:37.542 --> 00:09:39.443]  We know his name, but what's the point of him putting it out?
[00:09:39.463 --> 00:09:41.284]  We're not here to hurt you, you fool.
[00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:43.305]  Just let us live our lives.
[00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:52.009]  And he comes over, and we're all standing there on the sidewalk, not blocking traffic, not blocking the road.
[00:09:52.029 --> 00:09:56.831]  And he comes over and he says, I want you guys to go or I'm going to have to arrest you.
[00:09:58.487 --> 00:10:00.767]  And I was real friendly to the police up until that point.
[00:10:01.308 --> 00:10:13.670]  And I've told this story a few times, and I started, uh... I told the crowd that they were going to try to take the First Amendment head-on and that get all their faces on video camera so that we could file official oppression charges on them.
[00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:23.552]  And then, uh... a captain shows up and he comes over and tells me that if we block any sidewalk or any of the streets, we're going to be arrested.
[00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:27.013]  Now, the other guy, they'd already started massing paddy wagons and
[00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.272]  Over 100 police and we're telling us they were coming to arrest us.
[00:10:30.912 --> 00:10:37.795]  And then a reporter runs over to them and says, Oh, Alex is saying on a bullhorn, you just threatened to arrest everyone.
[00:10:37.815 --> 00:10:39.456]  And he says, Oh, that's not true.
[00:10:39.496 --> 00:10:40.156]  That's a lie.
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.460]  Now that's when I got mad.
[00:10:42.861 --> 00:10:46.782]  Not only did you attack the literal underbelly of America.
[00:10:47.282 --> 00:10:50.303]  I mean, if we don't have the First Amendment, we're Communist Russia or Communist China.
[00:10:51.204 --> 00:10:52.084]  We're Nazi Germany.
[00:10:52.344 --> 00:10:53.524]  I mean, that is a big deal.
[00:10:53.624 --> 00:10:56.626]  A lot of people fought and died for that First Amendment.
[00:10:56.906 --> 00:11:01.427]  That literally is the first ten amendments.
[00:11:01.487 --> 00:11:03.668]  That literally is the beginning of the Bill of Rights.
[00:11:03.768 --> 00:11:05.909]  It is the numero uno.
[00:11:05.989 --> 00:11:08.730]  It is the heart of the United States.
[00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:16.318]  And the police were so shocked that I would get mad that they were threatening to take us to jail.
[00:11:16.358 --> 00:11:17.999]  You know, we're human beings.
[00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:19.920]  We have families.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:21.720]  We have value.
[00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.622]  I have to talk to you like you talk to psychopaths.
[00:11:25.622 --> 00:11:31.524]  Whenever they kidnap some child, the police get on the news and they say, Little Jenny has parents that love her.
[00:11:32.285 --> 00:11:34.145]  This is her little dog Spot.
[00:11:34.586 --> 00:11:36.106]  She loves her grandmother.
[00:11:36.846 --> 00:11:38.027]  She has feelings.
[00:11:39.051 --> 00:11:44.653]  And sometimes the people, if they're not complete psychopaths, and have any humanity left, will let the child go.
[00:11:46.993 --> 00:11:49.114]  Well, I mean, a lot of times cops are about to arrest us.
[00:11:49.614 --> 00:11:52.995]  They could be in Chicago, or New York, or wherever, and I'll say, you know, I have a family.
[00:11:53.675 --> 00:11:54.616]  I'm a human being.
[00:11:55.196 --> 00:11:56.616]  I'm just out here on the street.
[00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.737]  Would you want your mother to be treated like this?
[00:11:59.777 --> 00:12:00.818]  Or your son?
[00:12:00.878 --> 00:12:01.698]  Or your father?
[00:12:01.718 --> 00:12:08.500]  Well, let me just tell the cops, we're out there because Rick Perry went to Istanbul, Turkey,
[00:12:09.289 --> 00:12:12.091]  To be bought and sold on the market like a prostitute.
[00:12:13.312 --> 00:12:14.213]  To be bid on.
[00:12:14.313 --> 00:12:15.274]  Literally, that's what they do.
[00:12:16.054 --> 00:12:18.556]  He went there to present himself to the global elite.
[00:12:18.797 --> 00:12:25.902]  He's handing over the power plants, the water, the reservoirs, the roads.
[00:12:26.623 --> 00:12:29.085]  We are in complete and total implosion here.
[00:12:29.285 --> 00:12:30.746]  I mean, it is literally the end of the state.
[00:12:33.188 --> 00:12:34.409]  As far as infrastructure goes.
[00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.711]  I mean, this is red-level crisis.
[00:12:37.822 --> 00:12:38.963]  You cannot put it in words.
[00:12:39.624 --> 00:12:43.887]  You think I like having to go out on a hot summer day and go out there and put up with you?
[00:12:44.828 --> 00:12:47.130]  You think I enjoy having to put up with you?
[00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:48.071]  You think I like it?
[00:12:48.491 --> 00:12:56.858]  You think I like yuppies laughing at us when Perry was at some fundraiser ball and flipping us off and thinking, you think I like that?
[00:12:57.179 --> 00:12:58.019]  I don't enjoy it!
[00:13:00.141 --> 00:13:03.264]  You think I like having to smell your bad breath when you get up in my face, cops?
[00:13:03.644 --> 00:13:04.265]  I don't like it!
[00:13:06.042 --> 00:13:17.165]  I don't like having to watch you guys and your gang mentality stoop to each other and the lower level cops come up subserviently to the bigger cops like it's some type of, you know, monkey, king, rat behavior.
[00:13:17.425 --> 00:13:18.585]  You think I like seeing that?
[00:13:18.845 --> 00:13:21.466]  No, I don't even like looking at you, okay?
[00:13:23.666 --> 00:13:31.188]  I'm out there because a criminal has hijacked my state and only got 37% of the vote because he staged that whole four-way election.
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.702]  I'm out there because we don't have anywhere to run.
[00:13:36.742 --> 00:13:38.383]  We don't have any new world to go to.
[00:13:38.623 --> 00:13:41.045]  We don't have any free country to go to, or I would leave.
[00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:42.986]  It's that bad.
[00:13:43.546 --> 00:13:44.467]  I love this country.
[00:13:44.807 --> 00:13:50.111]  We were out there because we're trying to draw attention to the treason of the Governor of Texas.
[00:13:54.433 --> 00:14:00.117]  We're out there resisting with the salt of the earth, best citizens in this state, in this county, in this city.
[00:14:00.517 --> 00:14:01.558]  Wonderful people.
[00:14:04.151 --> 00:14:12.334]  Of every race, color, and creed, Hispanic, black, white, doesn't matter, who all have red blood in their veins and love their children and love their country.
[00:14:13.015 --> 00:14:19.057]  And here you come over, and we got video of you before he came over just looking at me with disgust and just shaking his head.
[00:14:19.077 --> 00:14:23.099]  Hey, I look at you with disgust and I shake my head at you!
[00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:31.222]  Shaking your head, looking at me like I'm some kind of criminal, shocked that people would be out there with a bullhorn.
[00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:34.519]  How do you think this country was born?
[00:14:35.099 --> 00:14:37.041]  What do you think they did in the Boston Tea Party?
[00:14:37.221 --> 00:14:40.344]  They did a lot more than just go out and yell at the governor.
[00:14:45.247 --> 00:14:47.950]  So y'all sit there and look at me with disgust, shaking your heads.
[00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:49.010]  I mean, it just shocks me.
[00:14:49.391 --> 00:14:50.672]  Like, we're the bad guys.
[00:14:51.312 --> 00:14:56.376]  Not the criminal, openly, publicly attending international crime summits.
[00:14:56.556 --> 00:14:57.217]  That's what it is.
[00:14:57.517 --> 00:14:59.258]  Huge mafia commission meeting.
[00:15:00.119 --> 00:15:01.040]  The global mafia.
[00:15:02.404 --> 00:15:06.446]  Selling out your children's future and you're looking at me with disgust.
[00:15:06.966 --> 00:15:07.666]  But that's fine.
[00:15:08.046 --> 00:15:19.051]  I was friendly and congenial and tried to comply with requests that you made that were frankly unreasonable until you came over and then you said, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:23.653]  And at that point, you're trying to literally decapitate this country.
[00:15:24.213 --> 00:15:28.898]  You are there, death by a thousand cuts, stabbing this country in the heart.
[00:15:29.319 --> 00:15:30.720]  You've set the precedent nationwide.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.781]  They arrest people all over.
[00:15:32.021 --> 00:15:36.706]  They say, oh, you're not allowed to demonstrate, you're not allowed to protest, you're not allowed to hand out flyers down the street.
[00:15:36.886 --> 00:15:39.409]  They're telling churches you're not allowed to have political views.
[00:15:42.172 --> 00:15:43.173]  When the Bill of Rights says,
[00:15:45.865 --> 00:15:50.667]  Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[00:15:50.707 --> 00:15:52.108]  You have nothing to say, nothing to do.
[00:15:52.148 --> 00:16:01.451]  You can't tax, you can't regulate, you have nothing to do with churches or with the press or with the right to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.
[00:16:04.873 --> 00:16:07.494]  But you go around and tell people that and other people go along with you and
[00:16:08.647 --> 00:16:09.627]  So I got up in Canada.
[00:16:09.647 --> 00:16:12.548]  We had the cops in front of the Brook Street Hotel for Bilderberg last year.
[00:16:13.148 --> 00:16:14.948]  Just come up in the night and go, you can't park here.
[00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:16.068]  We're going to arrest you.
[00:16:16.148 --> 00:16:16.769]  We have that on tape.
[00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:19.089]  And I go, but the sign says parking right here.
[00:16:19.129 --> 00:16:20.849]  I said, uh, go ahead and arrest me.
[00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:25.010]  And I was so tired.
[00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.991]  I didn't even threaten her with the customary, I'm going to sue you, which I would do.
[00:16:28.511 --> 00:16:29.691]  Believe me, I don't like spending the money.
[00:16:29.711 --> 00:16:30.971]  I don't like having to do the right thing.
[00:16:31.411 --> 00:16:32.311]  I just have to do it.
[00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.352]  And I understand you're all run by the queen up there.
[00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:35.852]  So, you know,
[00:16:38.091 --> 00:16:39.472]  But the point is, there was the sign.
[00:16:39.492 --> 00:16:45.193]  We were clearly parked all day, and the earlier police were real nice during the day, but at night, you know, it was some women cops.
[00:16:45.233 --> 00:16:47.934]  I'm not bashing women cops, but for some reason they're always ten times worse.
[00:16:48.654 --> 00:17:00.778]  You just thought you'd just, you know, color a law, just make stuff up, just herd the cattle, herd the slaves, as if your family and you were going to have a good life in a society where people just get ordered around.
[00:17:01.458 --> 00:17:03.739]  Hell, I might as well move to Guatemala or China then.
[00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.407]  But then it wasn't enough.
[00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:10.188]  Then the police had to lie.
[00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.311]  And say that they never threatened to arrest us.
[00:17:15.072 --> 00:17:16.493]  When we have it on three different cameras.
[00:17:19.195 --> 00:17:20.656]  Leave now, we're going to have you arrested.
[00:17:21.136 --> 00:17:22.477]  Okay, go ahead and have us arrested.
[00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:24.299]  Okay, I'm going to call in more people who are going to do it.
[00:17:25.399 --> 00:17:29.282]  But the quote is, that's just stupid.
[00:17:32.865 --> 00:17:33.986]  And then he turns and says,
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.441]  I'll just have to call in more people then and arrest you all.
[00:17:39.002 --> 00:17:42.184]  And then he goes right over to the press and tells them the opposite.
[00:17:42.224 --> 00:17:44.766]  See, that's how these people operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:46.927 --> 00:17:53.331]  And I had one of those reporters up there from Plainfield with the Brown case just go, yeah, the cops were going to raid it.
[00:17:53.891 --> 00:17:55.832]  Yeah, I know that, but they have to lie.
[00:17:55.852 --> 00:17:56.953]  I mean, that's just what they do.
[00:17:57.533 --> 00:17:59.334]  You know, that's the operation.
[00:17:59.394 --> 00:18:02.076]  I said, but you're not supposed to lie for them.
[00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:04.237]  You're supposed to report on what the facts are.
[00:18:05.197 --> 00:18:07.217]  She goes, well, we just disagree on that.
[00:18:07.897 --> 00:18:08.778]  And I guess we do.
[00:18:08.798 --> 00:18:13.138]  Folks, when everybody starts lying, you go into tyranny real fast.
[00:18:13.598 --> 00:18:16.019]  And then, eh, why not lie about taking your pension fund?
[00:18:16.299 --> 00:18:17.959]  Why not lie about taking your bank account?
[00:18:18.259 --> 00:18:20.960]  Why not, why shouldn't politicians just get together and take your property?
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.741]  You see, we have liberty and freedom because the world's a dangerous place.
[00:18:28.541 --> 00:18:33.622]  And it's normally a bunch of king rats feeding on the population, and that's why societies never have
[00:18:34.987 --> 00:18:38.289]  Wealth, or industry, or success, or creativity.
[00:18:38.609 --> 00:18:42.331]  Because once a society goes bad, the average person goes, why should I build and make something?
[00:18:42.611 --> 00:18:43.732]  They'll just come take it from me.
[00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:45.393]  And things fall apart real quick.
[00:18:45.753 --> 00:18:48.854]  And you've got lots of little thugs in their little uniforms walking.
[00:18:48.974 --> 00:18:50.155]  And that's what we're turning into.
[00:18:50.555 --> 00:18:51.416]  That's the new jobs.
[00:18:51.476 --> 00:18:53.837]  It's just cops everywhere, millions of them feeding on us.
[00:18:54.737 --> 00:18:56.698]  And they're just going to hire millions more, they're now saying.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.080]  There were 300,000 of them 15 years ago.
[00:19:02.987 --> 00:19:04.708]  They got well over a million cops now.
[00:19:04.768 --> 00:19:06.509]  They're talking about hiring two million more!
[00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:14.352]  And so we get footage out of Arkansas with clean cut.
[00:19:14.912 --> 00:19:18.774]  And it'd be wrong if they were arresting people with blue mohawks or pink mohawks.
[00:19:19.634 --> 00:19:20.595]  I mean, so what?
[00:19:21.175 --> 00:19:22.115]  They're human beings too.
[00:19:22.715 --> 00:19:26.717]  But these are... These are children.
[00:19:27.778 --> 00:19:29.698]  But their press is reporting one's 11, one's 12, one's 13.
[00:19:32.324 --> 00:19:33.665]  And they're just out skateboarding.
[00:19:36.047 --> 00:19:39.570]  And, uh, like a skateboard's an Al-Qaeda weapon.
[00:19:41.212 --> 00:19:42.413]  And, I mean, they don't even resist.
[00:19:42.433 --> 00:19:46.056]  And the cop's just sitting there choking them, going... You can actually see him enjoying it.
[00:19:46.717 --> 00:19:47.057]  Oh, yeah.
[00:19:47.097 --> 00:19:48.578]  And he's just choking with pleasure.
[00:19:48.598 --> 00:19:50.160]  I mean, there are people who like to choke children.
[00:19:51.301 --> 00:19:53.262]  And they go get badges and guns, and they do it.
[00:19:54.003 --> 00:19:55.324]  So, it's coming up.
[00:19:55.384 --> 00:19:58.227]  I mean, most of us, we don't enjoy that, but some people do.
[00:20:02.685 --> 00:20:04.727]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.368 --> 00:20:14.297]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.737 --> 00:20:21.945]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.643 --> 00:20:28.147]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:20:40.215 --> 00:20:42.237]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:20:45.998 --> 00:20:51.761]  Hi, this is Tom Andrew with Midas Resources, your source for gold and silver.

[00:21:30.392 --> 00:21:36.956]  Precious metals has always preserved purchasing power during times of confiscatory taxation and rampant inflation.
[00:21:37.594 --> 00:21:44.176]  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan predicts a recession of alarming magnitude due to increasing budget and trade deficits.
[00:21:44.797 --> 00:21:51.879]  Listen folks, the current economic system is like a game of financial musical chairs.
[00:21:51.899 --> 00:21:52.519]  1-800-606-1294.

[00:23:01.221 --> 00:23:03.602]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[00:23:04.143 --> 00:23:05.603]  After a pedicure they look great.
[00:23:05.944 --> 00:23:09.786]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[00:23:10.226 --> 00:23:12.427]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:23:12.847 --> 00:23:16.189]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.051]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:23:19.551 --> 00:23:20.592]  What's that name again?
[00:23:21.012 --> 00:23:22.173]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:23:22.573 --> 00:23:23.713]  It's CalX.
[00:23:24.134 --> 00:23:25.975]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:23:26.335 --> 00:23:28.176]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:37.551]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:23:38.011 --> 00:23:43.714]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:23:44.114 --> 00:23:55.238]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:23:55.894 --> 00:23:57.015]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[00:23:57.335 --> 00:23:57.996]  I'll be right back.
[00:23:58.116 --> 00:23:59.877]  I'm getting some callux for my heels.
[00:24:06.542 --> 00:24:22.755]  So, not only do the Austin police, despite all the lawsuits the city and the state have lost for arresting demonstrators, this city in New York where freedom has been totally destroyed, men, they not only try to falsely arrest us,
[00:24:24.418 --> 00:24:26.199]  And intimidate us in color of law.
[00:24:26.539 --> 00:24:27.219]  That's a big deal.
[00:24:27.239 --> 00:24:28.200]  Again, I'm a human being.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.661]  I mean, I am a human being.
[00:24:31.061 --> 00:24:34.203]  I deserve the same rights and the same respect you deserve.
[00:24:35.543 --> 00:24:36.724]  Again, I am a human being.
[00:24:36.824 --> 00:24:38.945]  I demand you think of me that way.
[00:24:39.065 --> 00:24:41.026]  I demand you get out of your gang mentality.
[00:24:42.466 --> 00:24:48.929]  You ought to read your own gang mentality little handbooks, your own gang psychology handbooks and look in the mirror.
[00:24:49.229 --> 00:24:50.930]  Again, that's how they manipulate you and control you.
[00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:52.551]  By the way, your bosses could care less about you.
[00:24:53.308 --> 00:24:54.729]  It's all about petty power trips.
[00:24:56.910 --> 00:25:02.173]  And then you try to lie about us and say we're liars.
[00:25:03.094 --> 00:25:04.955]  While you attack the First Amendment.
[00:25:06.295 --> 00:25:09.677]  Well, uh, the officer has been placed on paid leave, of course.
[00:25:10.618 --> 00:25:12.959]  The Hot Springs, Arkansas, beautiful little town.
[00:25:13.359 --> 00:25:14.720]  Great place, been there many times.
[00:25:15.861 --> 00:25:21.264]  And, uh, scenic, and I mean this is just some young teenagers
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:46.653]  Now there's camera phone photos, and before the video starts it's even worse, but the camera phone photos are clear, and he just tackles the first one and starts choking him, and then the camera phone starts getting video at that point, but there's photos before that, and literally the person's got their hands out, they're intelligently, not resisting, this is a really smart 12 year old, and the girl's 11.
[00:25:47.996 --> 00:25:51.999]  I mean, most adults wouldn't know to do that, because he would have gotten an assault charge on top of it.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:59.285]  Sitting there, taking the child, I mean, and this is a full grown, big man, choking the child with full force on the carotid arteries.
[00:26:01.047 --> 00:26:03.889]  Of course, who may not be resisting this, may be passed out.
[00:26:04.509 --> 00:26:11.675]  Then, a young man, call him a child, but it sounds like an adult with a lot more wisdom out of the mouths of babes.
[00:26:11.695 --> 00:26:13.717]  He said, why are you choking him?
[00:26:14.177 --> 00:26:15.218]  We're just skateboarding.
[00:26:16.107 --> 00:26:17.288]  I don't think so.
[00:26:38.675 --> 00:26:43.217]  And he goes, and literally makes this noise and leaps at her.
[00:26:43.557 --> 00:26:46.298]  And I mean, children will run, folks, if they're scared.
[00:26:46.598 --> 00:26:48.698]  She turns and goes, and she doesn't get far.
[00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:50.359]  He grabs her and starts choking her.
[00:26:50.379 --> 00:26:55.661]  And then another young man is going, why are you choking a girl now?
[00:26:56.501 --> 00:26:57.942]  Why are you doing this?
[00:27:00.683 --> 00:27:04.004]  And the whole time he's going, I've got it!
[00:27:04.484 --> 00:27:05.944]  I'm an officer!
[00:27:06.325 --> 00:27:07.305]  You, you, you!
[00:27:08.817 --> 00:27:10.518]  And he keeps saying they've done something.
[00:27:10.558 --> 00:27:14.880]  And of course, some of them ran in fear after he starts choking people out with pleasure.
[00:27:15.761 --> 00:27:17.121]  He's a psychopath, folks!
[00:27:18.342 --> 00:27:19.282]  Let's play part of the tape.
[00:27:19.302 --> 00:27:20.343]  We'll come back and play the rest.
[00:27:20.623 --> 00:27:22.564]  You've got to go to prisonplanet.com and watch it.
[00:27:23.465 --> 00:27:24.145]  But here it is.
[00:27:28.604 --> 00:27:29.284]  It's like a yo-yo.
[00:27:29.304 --> 00:27:29.784]  Turn over.
[00:27:29.844 --> 00:27:30.624]  It's like a yo-yo.
[00:27:30.704 --> 00:27:32.665]  He's riding a skateboard.
[00:27:32.785 --> 00:27:34.945]  Turn over on your belly now.
[00:27:34.965 --> 00:27:35.525]  What is that?
[00:27:35.565 --> 00:27:38.146]  What is it?
[00:27:38.246 --> 00:27:40.766]  He was riding a skateboard.
[00:27:40.926 --> 00:27:42.367]  He was riding a skateboard?
[00:27:42.387 --> 00:27:43.907]  Did I tell you to stop?
[00:27:44.127 --> 00:27:46.227]  You told me to keep going?
[00:27:46.887 --> 00:27:47.588]  That's the way it is.
[00:27:47.808 --> 00:27:48.608]  That's the way it is.
[00:27:48.668 --> 00:27:50.148]  And this is where we're coming from.
[00:27:50.208 --> 00:27:51.788]  In the Mali City Orchard.
[00:27:51.848 --> 00:27:52.368]  He's tugging.
[00:27:52.428 --> 00:27:53.229]  He's riding a skateboard.
[00:27:53.249 --> 00:27:55.229]  This cop just choked him and I gotta take care of it.
[00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.469]  Come here.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.761]  Oh, and you're running from the police?
[00:27:58.801 --> 00:27:59.282]  That's not true!
[00:27:59.582 --> 00:28:00.142]  That's not good!
[00:28:00.162 --> 00:28:01.023]  This is not good, ma'am.
[00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:01.303]  Hit pause.
[00:28:01.343 --> 00:28:02.844]  Now you hear him go, this is not good.
[00:28:03.044 --> 00:28:07.767]  I mean, these young people, again, shouted more adult than most of these 45-year-old yuppies you see.
[00:28:19.373 --> 00:28:24.637]  By the way, you can hear on the tape some sicko lady going, good, they shouldn't be out here skateboarding.
[00:28:24.957 --> 00:28:27.019]  You should submit to them.
[00:28:27.099 --> 00:28:29.721]  I mean, literally, these people are demons.
[00:28:30.481 --> 00:28:31.402]  They want slavery.
[00:28:31.442 --> 00:28:32.463]  They want to live under tyranny.
[00:28:32.483 --> 00:28:33.424]  They hate America.
[00:28:33.464 --> 00:28:33.844]  Here it is.
[00:28:38.567 --> 00:28:47.194]  Now, you got people videotaping this, and the kids start getting scared.
[00:28:47.234 --> 00:28:47.454]  They go,
[00:28:48.163 --> 00:28:48.723]  Let's leave.
[00:28:48.743 --> 00:28:49.724]  Uh-uh.
[00:28:49.804 --> 00:28:52.986]  You stay right there, you're under arrest too!
[00:28:53.266 --> 00:28:55.628]  Back to the tape.
[00:28:55.708 --> 00:28:59.851]  I'm not running, I'm standing right here.
[00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:03.213]  I didn't even know you came out.
[00:29:03.253 --> 00:29:03.693]  Where is it?
[00:29:20.086 --> 00:29:20.827]  Okay, pause.
[00:29:21.587 --> 00:29:23.068]  When we get back, we'll play the really bad part.
[00:29:23.088 --> 00:29:27.350]  You gotta see the video to really catch it, but you can, you'll get to hear the cop flipping out on a power trip.
[00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:33.774]  I mean, literally, just, they're mentally ill people with guns and badges, and the government's told them, attack the public.
[00:29:34.694 --> 00:29:36.615]  I mean, again, state police used to be nice at the Capitol.
[00:29:36.816 --> 00:29:37.736]  They're not nice anymore.
[00:29:38.056 --> 00:29:39.437]  It's just all letting us know.
[00:29:39.977 --> 00:29:40.918]  Of course, the cops don't know.
[00:29:40.978 --> 00:29:42.479]  Firing banks are taking over the U.S.
[00:29:42.819 --> 00:29:45.861]  They're getting ready for total tyranny, and they're just being ordered to act like this.
[00:29:45.901 --> 00:29:46.381]  They don't know why.
[00:29:51.403 --> 00:29:54.445]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.325 --> 00:29:58.106]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:06.686 --> 00:31:08.568]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:31:08.768 --> 00:31:11.812]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:31:11.992 --> 00:31:15.136]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:31:15.436 --> 00:31:17.258]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:31:17.558 --> 00:31:17.918]  We're good to go.
[00:31:34.003 --> 00:31:38.325]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.

[00:32:03.233 --> 00:32:04.053]  Come on, Bill.
[00:32:04.294 --> 00:32:06.115]  Two weeks ago, you were riding a bicycle.
[00:32:06.315 --> 00:32:09.458]  And today, you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[00:32:09.818 --> 00:32:10.378]  What did you do?
[00:32:10.499 --> 00:32:11.299]  Rob Bill Gates?
[00:32:11.399 --> 00:32:12.120]  No, John.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.381]  I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[00:32:13.661 --> 00:32:19.206]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:19.506 --> 00:32:25.791]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[00:32:26.131 --> 00:32:28.333]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[00:32:28.593 --> 00:32:29.914]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week.
[00:32:32.276 --> 00:32:32.636]  Whoa!
[00:32:33.077 --> 00:32:34.277]  What was that website again?
[00:32:34.357 --> 00:32:37.859]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.280]  Now write this down, John.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:43.743]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[00:32:43.883 --> 00:32:44.463]  Thanks, Bill.
[00:32:44.724 --> 00:32:45.944]  I'm going there right now.
[00:32:46.345 --> 00:32:47.025]  Check, please.
[00:32:48.806 --> 00:32:50.247]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[00:32:50.727 --> 00:32:51.328]  Sure, John.
[00:32:51.568 --> 00:32:55.930]  Don't forget, it's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:32:56.251 --> 00:32:57.912]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[00:32:58.092 --> 00:32:58.372]  Deal.
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.347]  Some folks are born with a silver spoon in their mouth.
[00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:17.033]  Yeah, don't they help themselves?
[00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:33.533]  And when the band plays, hell to the chiefs, Lord knows, they point the cannon at you.
[00:33:33.554 --> 00:33:34.114]  Stop that!
[00:33:34.154 --> 00:33:36.757]  God, it ain't me.
[00:33:36.837 --> 00:33:38.159]  It ain't me, no.
[00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:41.062]  I ain't no sinner, that's all.
[00:33:41.142 --> 00:33:42.043]  You hear me?
[00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:52.037]  It ain't me, no It ain't me, no I ain't the fortunate one
[00:33:59.807 --> 00:34:00.268]  We're good.
[00:34:18.549 --> 00:34:47.041]  It ain't me, no It ain't me, no I ain't no millionaire, no It ain't me, no It ain't me, no I ain't no fortunate one Some folks I know Inherit the fame of life Only to spin you off to war
[00:34:48.922 --> 00:35:02.313]  You know, I'm going to tell a story right now.
[00:35:02.813 --> 00:35:12.921]  I'm going to get back into the skateboarding.
[00:35:18.709 --> 00:35:33.313]  I guess it was about a year and a half ago, my mother was with one of her friends at dinner and her daughter's husband had his cop friend, a UT cop friend there at dinner.
[00:35:35.753 --> 00:35:39.434]  And my mom was like, oh he was real nice, he kept asking questions about you.
[00:35:40.454 --> 00:35:46.876]  And then he said, oh I just know I'll get to meet Alex one day, I just have a feeling we're going to run into him.
[00:35:47.805 --> 00:35:49.266]  My mom was like, oh, isn't that nice?
[00:35:49.306 --> 00:35:52.228]  And I was like, mother, that's the whole psychology.
[00:35:52.288 --> 00:35:56.550]  Just like some gang member with tats all over him in the east side.
[00:35:58.171 --> 00:36:01.593]  It's the thing of the marks you don't know what they're saying.
[00:36:02.653 --> 00:36:06.155]  Clearly he was saying, is that a cop tell me this in high school?
[00:36:07.116 --> 00:36:08.336]  Oh, we're going to get you.
[00:36:08.356 --> 00:36:09.717]  And I'm like, I don't do anything wrong.
[00:36:11.218 --> 00:36:12.379]  Oh, we're going to get you.
[00:36:12.559 --> 00:36:13.179]  Don't worry.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:16.441]  We'll get you one way or the other.
[00:36:18.661 --> 00:36:25.644]  That was because I was exposing the Rockwell Police Department and the Sheriff's Department trafficking narcotics a couple years after I'd been telling everybody about it.
[00:36:26.024 --> 00:36:28.125]  When I found out they dealt the drugs, I thought everybody should know.
[00:36:28.145 --> 00:36:33.947]  Then they gave my dad a call and said, we're going to kill your son if you don't shut him up.
[00:36:34.707 --> 00:36:37.068]  My dad didn't really tell me why we were moving to Austin.
[00:36:37.849 --> 00:36:40.610]  He just said, we're moving, and years later told me about it.
[00:36:41.430 --> 00:36:43.531]  I mean, see, this is the life I've lived, folks.
[00:36:46.437 --> 00:36:51.360]  I was shocked cops would pull me over, pull my friends over, and want to look for drugs when I didn't use drugs.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.842]  I had friends who smoked pot and stuff, and I had friends who went to jail for pot.
[00:36:55.882 --> 00:36:57.103]  I'm like, are those drug dealers?
[00:36:58.184 --> 00:37:04.027]  Because I knew drug dealers from people I'd grown up with and people I knew as brothers had grown up and were the local pot dealers or whatever.
[00:37:04.047 --> 00:37:08.690]  And I knew they were buying it from the sheriff and the police and buying the stuff a lot.
[00:37:08.890 --> 00:37:10.030]  And I was like, what?
[00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:11.571]  They're sending people to jail?
[00:37:11.591 --> 00:37:14.493]  I mean, I had cops pull me over one time and I went,
[00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:17.037]  I actually had a six-pack under this seat.
[00:37:18.217 --> 00:37:20.558]  Had one of those Chevy Silverados, a little compartment under it.
[00:37:21.399 --> 00:37:21.919]  Under the seat.
[00:37:21.939 --> 00:37:24.420]  I hadn't drunk it yet, I was gonna pick my girlfriend up.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.042]  And I just told the cop, I said, I don't use drugs and you guys sell it!
[00:37:28.482 --> 00:37:29.662]  I go, you're a drug dealer!
[00:37:29.962 --> 00:37:32.143]  And he just said, you shut your mouth!
[00:37:32.824 --> 00:37:33.844]  Who told you that?
[00:37:33.864 --> 00:37:36.725]  And he just went, just get out of here!
[00:37:36.745 --> 00:37:39.367]  We weren't supposed to play along with you?
[00:37:39.387 --> 00:37:42.288]  We're supposed to play along like you're the good guys?
[00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:48.757]  And so this UT cop's sitting there telling my mom, oh I just know we'll see Alex someday.
[00:37:49.217 --> 00:37:51.059]  I'll run into him at UT sometime.
[00:37:52.141 --> 00:37:53.382]  She said he was like laughing.
[00:37:53.402 --> 00:37:56.085]  And I'm like, don't you understand that's what gang members do.
[00:37:56.666 --> 00:37:58.969]  Oh, you know, our gang will run into you sometime.
[00:38:00.845 --> 00:38:01.727]  Like it's real funny.
[00:38:01.807 --> 00:38:02.548]  Listen, you understand?
[00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:03.991]  I could be killed tomorrow.
[00:38:04.191 --> 00:38:05.193]  I could be killed next month.
[00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:06.255]  You could put me in prison.
[00:38:06.455 --> 00:38:07.316]  You could ruin me.
[00:38:07.357 --> 00:38:08.839]  I want all my enemies to know this.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:11.464]  I have made the choice to do what I'm doing.
[00:38:12.025 --> 00:38:13.748]  I win no matter what you do.
[00:38:14.815 --> 00:38:15.976]  That's what I tell cops.
[00:38:15.996 --> 00:38:17.977]  You go ahead and you arrest me with false charges.
[00:38:18.397 --> 00:38:20.758]  You go ahead and beat me, taser me, do whatever you want.
[00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:21.418]  I win.
[00:38:21.679 --> 00:38:22.479]  Do you understand?
[00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:24.480]  I win no matter what you do.
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:26.301]  I have made the decision.
[00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:28.722]  I have made the decision to fight you.
[00:38:28.742 --> 00:38:31.744]  I have made the decision to stand up against you.
[00:38:31.764 --> 00:38:33.985]  I have made the decision to fight evil.
[00:38:35.025 --> 00:38:35.866]  I'm in control.
[00:38:36.606 --> 00:38:37.326]  You understand that?
[00:38:37.607 --> 00:38:39.828]  And I don't, it isn't that I even need to be in control.
[00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:41.088]  I realized that a few months ago.
[00:38:41.108 --> 00:38:41.809]  It was like an epiphany.
[00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:42.389]  I went, wait a minute.
[00:38:43.463 --> 00:38:45.544]  It was like, you know, the Holy Spirit spoke to me.
[00:38:45.564 --> 00:38:46.204]  I mean, literally.
[00:38:46.485 --> 00:38:47.165]  That's what it is.
[00:38:47.585 --> 00:38:55.449]  We make the decision to do the right thing, and we're not in control of our lives and what's going to happen to us, but we're at least in control of doing the right thing.
[00:38:57.281 --> 00:38:59.022]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall.
[00:38:59.482 --> 00:39:05.405]  I just know that duty is mine, consequence belongs to God, I'm doing the right thing, and you cannot win.
[00:39:05.605 --> 00:39:10.348]  You can torture me to death, you can pull my teeth out with pliers, you can kill my family.
[00:39:10.608 --> 00:39:22.834]  The point is, I have made the decision to do what I'm doing, and I'm never stopping, and I'm going to the end, and frankly it's an adventure, and I am honored to be doing what I'm doing, and I don't want people to cry for me,
[00:39:23.634 --> 00:39:27.137]  You know, they kill me, set me up, whatever.
[00:39:28.437 --> 00:39:32.280]  I want you to just know that's a sign of our strength and a sign of our victories to come.
[00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:34.802]  And a sign of the strength of this species.
[00:39:34.822 --> 00:39:38.824]  Let me tell you what's going to happen.
[00:39:38.844 --> 00:39:44.268]  They're going to keep beating kids up and macing people for no reason and pushing people around and doing all the things they do.
[00:39:45.931 --> 00:39:53.336]  And the martial law is going to get worse and worse, and all their face scanning cameras and all the rest of the junk isn't going to inhibit the people from fighting back against them.
[00:39:53.596 --> 00:39:57.819]  And they're going to have their own Lexington, their own Concords, they're going to have their own Kent States.
[00:39:58.819 --> 00:39:59.920]  They're going to kill people.
[00:40:01.381 --> 00:40:04.243]  And folks, they are going to get completely defeated.
[00:40:04.563 --> 00:40:04.903]  Okay?
[00:40:05.324 --> 00:40:06.724]  Just like V for Vendetta, folks.
[00:40:07.865 --> 00:40:08.886]  How it all starts.
[00:40:09.206 --> 00:40:11.047]  Dig out of the computer, where V's talking.
[00:40:11.287 --> 00:40:13.409]  We only played that once back when it came out a few years ago.
[00:40:14.229 --> 00:40:14.949]  Well, a year and a half ago.
[00:40:14.969 --> 00:40:15.850]  I want to play that again.
[00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:21.752]  Maybe the part where V's talking to the good police, trying to explain to them, you know, why didn't you come forward before?
[00:40:22.072 --> 00:40:23.412]  I was waiting for you, Inspector.
[00:40:23.452 --> 00:40:24.312]  I was waiting for you.
[00:40:24.332 --> 00:40:28.114]  I mean, I know there are good police out there, and we are waiting for you, Inspector.
[00:40:28.154 --> 00:40:29.074]  We're waiting for you.
[00:40:29.374 --> 00:40:32.395]  We're waiting for the good Officer Jack McClams out there.
[00:40:32.895 --> 00:40:37.177]  For those of you that aren't wink-minded, that aren't gang members, and look, I spend all day on the cops.
[00:40:37.417 --> 00:40:38.137]  I really shouldn't.
[00:40:38.577 --> 00:40:40.078]  You're just brain
[00:40:42.177 --> 00:40:46.359]  Screwed, propagandized, just like the general public, just like everybody else.
[00:40:46.859 --> 00:40:52.082]  And hell, I know you deal with drunks, and criminals, and drug addicts all day, and scum, and family violence.
[00:40:52.102 --> 00:40:54.183]  I mean, I'm not saying the society's perfect either.
[00:40:55.643 --> 00:40:58.425]  But things are going in the wrong direction, and what's happening is wrong.
[00:40:58.465 --> 00:41:00.186]  And you know you're there to collect money, mainly.
[00:41:00.826 --> 00:41:04.528]  You know you're there to collect money for the state, which is then handed to foreign private corporations.
[00:41:05.988 --> 00:41:06.989]  And I watch video
[00:41:09.002 --> 00:41:14.166]  Every time I say pink or blue mohawks, I get calls from friends of mine who are into that.
[00:41:14.226 --> 00:41:15.387]  I don't care what you wear.
[00:41:15.407 --> 00:41:18.609]  I don't care what your outfits are.
[00:41:18.629 --> 00:41:20.330]  I don't care what your hair looks like.
[00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.011]  My point is that means nothing to me.
[00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:27.034]  I'm just trying to get people to be about who they are and what they do in life.
[00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:40.875]  Instead of America being about, I'm a yuppie and I got a $5,000 set of golf clubs and a $100,000 car and a $3,000,000 house and that's my identity and I don't care about anything else.
[00:41:41.515 --> 00:41:51.879]  Or the good old boy who's got his lariat in the back of his truck, doesn't know how to rope a calf, but got a lariat and a big cowboy hat and his girlfriend rides right next to him and he's got George W. stickers all over his car and
[00:41:53.166 --> 00:41:58.191]  George Bush to him is God and a good conservative and America's doing just fine when it isn't doing just fine.
[00:41:58.432 --> 00:42:01.715]  Again, you're in your own little costume feeling good off on your own.
[00:42:01.735 --> 00:42:06.440]  I mean, that's very childlike to dress up in costumes and dress up in outfits.
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:13.287]  And again, it is a manifestation of people that are play acting.
[00:42:15.754 --> 00:42:17.274]  And I understand the power of play acting.
[00:42:17.314 --> 00:42:18.235]  I mean, I've done it in my own life.
[00:42:18.515 --> 00:42:23.816]  I had the Watson boys here a few years ago, and they went and bought some cowboy hats as a joke.
[00:42:23.856 --> 00:42:28.957]  And you put them in cowboy hats, they went from quiet introverts to wild extroverts.
[00:42:28.997 --> 00:42:31.278]  You've got to watch the video of them online.
[00:42:31.298 --> 00:42:37.139]  It was a little funny skit we did where they talk about how they're real Texans like George W. Bush and beat me up.
[00:42:37.459 --> 00:42:38.039]  It's pretty funny.
[00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:40.880]  And they went wild when those hats were on them.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:43.081]  It's like cops go wild when they're in black uniforms.
[00:42:43.481 --> 00:42:44.521]  And I know a lot of people wear
[00:42:45.524 --> 00:42:48.306]  certain outfits or have certain jewelry or certain haircuts because they like it.
[00:42:48.907 --> 00:42:50.428]  And that's just an accessory to who they are.
[00:42:50.448 --> 00:42:51.408]  I'm not saying you're bad.
[00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:55.611]  I'm not, you know, I'm not knocking any of those people.
[00:42:55.992 --> 00:43:04.137]  I just make the point that when you let your child dress like that, the police even alert on them ten times worse.
[00:43:06.019 --> 00:43:13.244]  You're basically dressed up in the prey animal outfit in the tribal conditioning and the very primitive brainwashing the police have been through
[00:43:14.119 --> 00:43:18.583]  And the police have been conditioned that skateboards are criminal, skateboards are evil, skateboards are of the devil.
[00:43:19.023 --> 00:43:23.026]  When skateboarding is the most popular thing, it's more popular than baseball and football put together now.
[00:43:24.908 --> 00:43:27.590]  Most popular sport in the country for people 18 and younger.
[00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.172]  But the cops have been told it's evil.
[00:43:30.452 --> 00:43:32.333]  They have handbooks saying skateboarding is evil.
[00:43:33.674 --> 00:43:35.736]  And so you see people skateboarding down the street.
[00:43:36.443 --> 00:43:41.445]  And the cop just starts going nuts, arresting everybody, flipping out, because to him, these are the bad guys.
[00:43:41.825 --> 00:43:42.765]  Now, he's in trouble.
[00:43:42.885 --> 00:43:46.527]  If these kids had Mohawks, folks, this guy wouldn't be getting ready to be fired.
[00:43:47.847 --> 00:43:49.548]  Now, again, I don't care about the Mohawk.
[00:43:49.628 --> 00:43:49.928]  Great.
[00:43:50.568 --> 00:43:52.549]  Have a purple one.
[00:43:52.769 --> 00:43:53.749]  Does it matter to me?
[00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.730]  I see Mohawks and think, oh, that looks kind of neat.
[00:44:00.071 --> 00:44:00.872]  I mean, I don't care.
[00:44:01.612 --> 00:44:04.453]  The point is, is that they're alerting on you.
[00:44:07.532 --> 00:44:08.833]  Again, it's all psychology.
[00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:12.794]  And so you've got these young people who have done nothing, and they're being reasonable.
[00:44:13.274 --> 00:44:14.134]  They're being nice.
[00:44:14.154 --> 00:44:15.355]  They're like, why are you doing this?
[00:44:15.615 --> 00:44:18.016]  And it enrages him, and then he attacks them.
[00:44:18.916 --> 00:44:23.018]  He is a cop, assaulting 11, 12, and 13 year olds.
[00:44:24.318 --> 00:44:25.739]  That's their ages, it's now in the news.
[00:44:26.619 --> 00:44:27.659]  11, 12, and 13 year olds.
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.420]  Assaulting them.
[00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:31.101]  I mean, he is cranking.
[00:44:31.141 --> 00:44:34.322]  Folks, you can see him with aggressive force,
[00:44:38.034 --> 00:44:39.314]  Cranking down on their necks, folks.
[00:44:39.334 --> 00:44:40.535]  You can kill somebody like that.
[00:44:41.776 --> 00:44:42.736]  Kill somebody real quick.
[00:44:43.617 --> 00:44:44.738]  Just assaulting children.
[00:44:46.719 --> 00:44:48.440]  You're supposed to do that behind closed doors.
[00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.241]  If you really want to do that, go be a CPS worker.
[00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:52.062]  See, you did it out on the street.
[00:44:52.462 --> 00:44:53.663]  So let's go ahead and finish up that tape.
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:57.921]  If you don't mind going, there's a skateboard in front of you.
[00:44:57.981 --> 00:44:59.082]  You know what's in it?
[00:44:59.142 --> 00:44:59.302]  You.
[00:44:59.382 --> 00:45:00.522]  Here, buddy, just get yours.
[00:45:00.562 --> 00:45:00.762]  Hey!
[00:45:00.802 --> 00:45:01.362]  What the f**k?
[00:45:01.522 --> 00:45:02.003]  Sir!
[00:45:02.063 --> 00:45:04.503]  He's riding a skateboard!
[00:45:04.824 --> 00:45:06.564]  What is wrong with you?
[00:45:06.684 --> 00:45:08.065]  He's riding a skateboard!
[00:45:08.085 --> 00:45:09.805]  Sir, you need to f**king... Hey!
[00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:10.426]  You crazy!
[00:45:16.149 --> 00:45:19.352]  Sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir, sir!
[00:45:19.372 --> 00:45:21.093]  Sir, it's okay.
[00:45:21.133 --> 00:45:21.633]  Get back!
[00:45:21.833 --> 00:45:23.154]  Okay, just, it's okay.
[00:45:23.194 --> 00:45:24.755]  I'm riding a skateboard.
[00:45:24.775 --> 00:45:25.956]  Get your arms behind your back.
[00:45:26.516 --> 00:45:26.656]  Sir!
[00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:29.358]  I was riding a skateboard.
[00:45:29.398 --> 00:45:30.239]  Sir, please.
[00:45:30.299 --> 00:45:31.900]  Put it down.
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:33.561]  Okay, okay, it's okay.
[00:45:33.601 --> 00:45:35.122]  Get your arms behind your back.
[00:45:35.302 --> 00:45:36.223]  Okay, okay.
[00:45:36.263 --> 00:45:38.384]  There's people out there riding people, doing drugs.
[00:45:38.404 --> 00:45:39.425]  Get your arms behind your back.
[00:45:39.685 --> 00:45:42.107]  And you worry about kids riding pieces of wood down the street.
[00:45:42.127 --> 00:45:43.788]  You don't take your hands behind that back, you understand me?
[00:45:43.808 --> 00:45:44.288]  Yes, sir.
[00:45:44.308 --> 00:45:45.009]  Or I'll spray you.
[00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.634]  Can I get my hat?
[00:45:48.654 --> 00:45:49.957]  Nope, you ain't gonna need it.
[00:45:49.997 --> 00:45:50.377]  Why not?
[00:45:50.758 --> 00:45:53.182]  Because you're going to jail.
[00:45:53.743 --> 00:45:54.584]  For riding a skateboard?
[00:45:54.725 --> 00:45:55.606]  For resisting arrest.
[00:45:55.967 --> 00:45:57.209]  Disorderly conduct.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:04.105]  Interference with a law enforcement officer.
[00:46:04.145 --> 00:46:05.947]  Well, when you resist, that's what happens.
[00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:07.188]  She wasn't even worried about it was she?
[00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:07.908]  She wanted to fight.
[00:46:07.928 --> 00:46:09.810]  So I don't want to hear it.
[00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:10.731]  Keep your hands behind your back.
[00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:11.291]  Don't move.
[00:46:11.331 --> 00:46:12.272]  You understand me?
[00:46:12.372 --> 00:46:14.134]  I'm going to roll you on one side.
[00:46:14.174 --> 00:46:16.756]  You're going to put your knees up underneath it.
[00:46:16.776 --> 00:46:17.537]  You understand?
[00:46:17.577 --> 00:46:17.797]  And, uh...
[00:46:27.555 --> 00:46:30.257]  I mean, you could see him savagely attacking children.
[00:46:30.778 --> 00:46:31.758]  Just out of the clear blue.
[00:46:31.798 --> 00:46:34.340]  And for them sitting there going, Sir, please calm down.
[00:46:34.380 --> 00:46:35.161]  He attacks them.
[00:46:36.962 --> 00:46:38.143]  And the girl doesn't resist.
[00:46:38.183 --> 00:46:39.484]  He begins charging her.
[00:46:39.504 --> 00:46:40.685]  Because she's saying, Stop!
[00:46:40.705 --> 00:46:41.065]  Stop!
[00:46:41.105 --> 00:46:41.746]  You're hurting him.
[00:46:42.186 --> 00:46:43.167]  He doesn't like hearing that.
[00:46:43.207 --> 00:46:45.088]  She doesn't like hearing he's hurting a human.
[00:46:46.629 --> 00:46:48.110]  I'm self-righteous.
[00:46:48.171 --> 00:46:49.151]  I'm going to attack you.
[00:46:50.392 --> 00:46:53.495]  And all she's able to do is turn to run by the time he reaches her.
[00:46:53.515 --> 00:46:53.995]  And boom!
[00:46:54.648 --> 00:46:58.611]  The concussion hits her and he just cranks her with full force, slinging.
[00:46:59.252 --> 00:47:04.175]  And folks, if they'd have broke her neck, it'd have been even worse.
[00:47:04.335 --> 00:47:05.416]  Who knows what they'd have done then.
[00:47:05.476 --> 00:47:06.837]  Guns probably would have gotten planted.
[00:47:08.739 --> 00:47:09.179]  You name it.
[00:47:09.499 --> 00:47:11.841]  But luckily one of these youth got away with the phone.
[00:47:14.163 --> 00:47:18.466]  And again folks, I think some of these cops, the guy looks pretty rookie.
[00:47:19.258 --> 00:47:20.979]  Don't you know, you can kill somebody.
[00:47:21.019 --> 00:47:25.623]  You grab somebody around the neck and you start jerking them around with force, you can kill them.
[00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.464]  People die all the time.
[00:47:29.486 --> 00:47:36.151]  And, uh... You know, I don't like what happened on that video.
[00:47:36.271 --> 00:47:43.916]  I'm sure a lot of you have seen the video of the cop starts bumping the guy's car and just going crazy and runs up and just sprays the guy with mace.
[00:47:44.237 --> 00:47:46.078]  And the guy just snaps and kills the cop.
[00:47:46.118 --> 00:47:48.600]  And it said some citizen came by and saw that and killed that guy.
[00:47:50.919 --> 00:47:53.881]  Argument for the Second Amendment, but the point is, people are just going to start snapping.
[00:47:54.601 --> 00:48:01.004]  I mean, cops snap all the time, just because their wife just grabbed at them on the cell phone and pulled out a gun and gunned a whole, you know, people down in a car.
[00:48:01.384 --> 00:48:03.385]  Cops try to cover it up, but it doesn't usually work too well.
[00:48:05.426 --> 00:48:06.467]  I mean, it's scary, man.
[00:48:06.527 --> 00:48:11.850]  Shaved head cops with tattoos all over them, with skull tattoos and devil tattoos all over them, stomping around.
[00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:12.630]  You see them everywhere.
[00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:20.494]  And I mean, they're on power trips and they're definitely on steroids, which permanently causes brain alterations.
[00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:26.480]  Those guys go into rages even after they're off steroids.
[00:48:28.341 --> 00:48:34.883]  There have been federal reports about the group in this country that is most on steroids is police.
[00:48:37.264 --> 00:48:45.288]  I guess after professional wrestlers, the study didn't look at that, but professional wrestlers, they die at like age 44 on average because they're on roids and they're all nuts.
[00:48:46.208 --> 00:48:48.869]  You got a bunch of cops looking just like them and acting just like them.
[00:48:49.189 --> 00:48:53.031]  And they're into it, just running around like maniacs on steroids and
[00:48:54.497 --> 00:49:00.239]  You know, and we're just little pathetic Americans just trying to get by and trying to live with a bunch of nuts running around.
[00:49:02.619 --> 00:49:10.622]  I know a fella, is a manager at Home Depot, and the cop that did it, big ol' huge guy, got promoted after this.
[00:49:11.082 --> 00:49:12.402]  He was already an officer.
[00:49:14.463 --> 00:49:16.063]  Pulls him over and he says, what are these?
[00:49:17.924 --> 00:49:20.325]  And the fella says, those are my hand controls.
[00:49:20.405 --> 00:49:21.805]  And he's paralyzed from the chest down.
[00:49:22.699 --> 00:49:23.960]  And he said, get out of the car.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.262]  And he said, well, uh, okay.
[00:49:26.362 --> 00:49:28.363]  I've got to, uh, my wife's beside me.
[00:49:28.403 --> 00:49:29.184]  She's got to get out.
[00:49:29.965 --> 00:49:31.686]  He didn't even go in and he says, get out.
[00:49:32.346 --> 00:49:32.887]  He's like, okay.
[00:49:32.907 --> 00:49:37.130]  And he starts opening the door and his wife trying to get up and to, to, to get the wheelchair out of the back.
[00:49:37.170 --> 00:49:39.452]  And he says, get in the car for cussing at her.
[00:49:40.112 --> 00:49:41.133]  And he says, sure.
[00:49:41.193 --> 00:49:42.054]  I'm, I'm paralyzed.
[00:49:43.755 --> 00:49:49.559]  The cops started cussing, grabbed him by the hair and drug him out on the ground and started slamming his head into the ground.
[00:49:50.540 --> 00:49:51.581]  Just having a rage.
[00:49:52.483 --> 00:49:55.905]  I mean, we're not here for you to go into rages on.
[00:49:55.945 --> 00:49:56.285]  We're not.
[00:49:56.525 --> 00:49:58.046]  We're human beings.
[00:50:02.908 --> 00:50:07.290]  We're not here because you watch 24 all day and fantasize about being a tough guy.
[00:50:09.011 --> 00:50:10.032]  And we're tired of it.
[00:50:10.712 --> 00:50:12.233]  And you make good police look bad.
[00:50:12.253 --> 00:50:16.595]  I mean, I know there's good police all over this country that help old ladies change tires and are
[00:50:17.176 --> 00:50:44.462]  doing the right thing and they're usually quiet and just do their job but I mean I'm telling you folks more and more they're a bunch of wild-eyed goons or at best they're like smiley face frat boys and everything's real funny but at least they're not completely evil let me tell you when I see some big shaved head guy breathing heavy with devil tats all over him with giant biceps I just in my heart I go that's tyranny right there that's an enemy of the Republic
[00:50:46.326 --> 00:50:46.927]  So know that.
[00:50:47.008 --> 00:50:48.631]  You're on the wrong side of history.
[00:50:49.132 --> 00:50:50.554]  You're on the wrong side of God.
[00:50:50.574 --> 00:50:55.664]  And you have enmity against your fellow man and you will have terrible lives.
[00:50:56.125 --> 00:50:57.408]  Well come back and start taking your calls.
[00:51:03.448 --> 00:51:06.632]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.

[00:51:09.296 --> 00:51:16.886]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.614 --> 00:51:24.658]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.078 --> 00:51:36.524]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.804 --> 00:51:40.706]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:42.708]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.028 --> 00:51:46.890]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:56.159 --> 00:54:56.960]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.982]  And there's no debating that.
[00:54:59.042 --> 00:54:59.623]  God bless you.
[00:54:59.643 --> 00:55:02.986]  And I want to thank all the PrisonPlanet.tv members as well.
[00:55:04.146 --> 00:55:06.849]  Let's talk to Will in Missouri, because he disagrees.
[00:55:06.929 --> 00:55:07.909]  He goes ahead of the line.
[00:55:07.949 --> 00:55:08.430]  Go ahead, Will.
[00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:10.451]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking the call.
[00:55:10.551 --> 00:55:12.433]  I disagree on a point of information.
[00:55:12.533 --> 00:55:29.567]  Basically, in the beginning of the broadcast, you came out and stated that, I don't remember spending so much information between now and then, how exactly you phrased it, but that Ron Paul's campaign or participation in the Iowa Tax Relief Forum was
[00:55:30.879 --> 00:55:31.179]  I don't know.
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.561]  Do you recall the word you used or how you said it?
[00:55:33.581 --> 00:55:35.402]  It was like he was being blocked from it or something?
[00:55:35.562 --> 00:55:37.783]  How many angels can dance on the head of a pin, sir?
[00:55:37.823 --> 00:55:41.225]  You can't tell me what you disagree with, and I can't respond to it.
[00:55:41.725 --> 00:55:44.027]  Please listen to me, because I can tell you what I disagree with.
[00:55:44.447 --> 00:55:52.091]  Because in the American Free Press, they also have an article here that says, Representative Ron Paul's campaign being sabotaged in Iowa.
[00:55:52.531 --> 00:55:57.414]  And then they listed the telephone numbers for the Iowa Tax Relief Group.
[00:55:57.878 --> 00:56:04.142]  So I contacted them yesterday and left a message for Ed Faler to contact me back, which he did.
[00:56:04.522 --> 00:56:07.044]  And it was about only about five or ten minutes before he called me back.
[00:56:07.164 --> 00:56:07.884]  Just tell your story.
[00:56:08.264 --> 00:56:08.524]  I am.
[00:56:08.945 --> 00:56:21.492]  And so what he told me basically was that of all of the various vitriol and violent type phone calls and emails that he received, I was one of the first persons that had a, you know, a cogent inquiry.
[00:56:21.552 --> 00:56:22.713]  And so he did call me back.
[00:56:23.193 --> 00:56:24.374]  And so while we were talking,
[00:56:24.878 --> 00:56:38.629]  I asked him if he'd had a position statement, you know, basically regarding their decision not to include Dr. Paul in the debate, and what he said was that they had a meeting on March the 5th where they selected the candidates that would be in the forum.
[00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:41.672]  And they had two criteria that they used to make that selection.
[00:56:42.552 --> 00:56:47.216]  First was that the candidates had to have a 1% or better showing on a poll.
[00:56:47.576 --> 00:56:50.739]  When I asked him which poll it was, he wasn't able to give me the answer to that.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.782]  And then they also had to have an exploratory committee.
[00:56:53.802 --> 00:56:56.303]  I'm going to stop you, but I'll put him on hold, okay?
[00:56:58.965 --> 00:57:04.728]  This guy he's talking about is, nationally, John McCain's chief strategist.
[00:57:05.689 --> 00:57:08.370]  Ron Paul, in the Las Vegas odds, is surging.
[00:57:08.931 --> 00:57:11.872]  Ron Paul has won hundreds of major polls.
[00:57:12.473 --> 00:57:17.996]  He's been restricted from nine-tenths of state polls and national polls.
[00:57:18.556 --> 00:57:19.377]  So he's been cheated.
[00:57:20.289 --> 00:57:23.051]  And so this is just a bunch of hyperbole.
[00:57:23.451 --> 00:57:26.393]  The caller cannot say what he disagrees with.
[00:57:26.413 --> 00:57:28.234]  I'm going to give him one more chance.
[00:57:28.254 --> 00:57:30.976]  Okay, they did exclude him.
[00:57:31.996 --> 00:57:33.757]  Okay, they have put out a press release.
[00:57:34.358 --> 00:57:39.881]  Okay, so I don't know what is being being disagreed with here.
[00:57:40.161 --> 00:57:41.102]  He has been barred.
[00:57:41.142 --> 00:57:42.863]  They've got all the other candidates coming.
[00:57:43.918 --> 00:57:48.605]  Uh, and, uh, so, that's the bottom line, and I don't know the whole point of this.
[00:57:48.625 --> 00:57:49.025]  Go ahead.
[00:57:49.426 --> 00:57:52.991]  Okay, well, the point of it is, is that it was not an attack on Ron Paul.
[00:57:53.431 --> 00:57:55.895]  It was at a time period that they made their selection.
[00:57:56.494 --> 00:58:04.059]  And that there have been Democrat candidates invited to come as well, and that most of them have not returned their invitation.
[00:58:04.099 --> 00:58:06.040]  What does that have to do with disagreeing with something I said?
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.201]  What did I say that was wrong?
[00:58:07.341 --> 00:58:14.326]  Well, I think what we need to do is make sure that when we say that, you know, he's being barred or blocked... He was barred!
[00:58:14.366 --> 00:58:14.666]  Yeah!
[00:58:14.946 --> 00:58:16.527]  They requested to go and they said no.
[00:58:16.587 --> 00:58:17.228]  Thanks for the call.
[00:58:17.528 --> 00:58:17.988]  You know what?
[00:58:18.008 --> 00:58:19.950]  I mean, that is incredible spin!
[00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:25.073]  You can't even say what I'm wrong about, because I'm not wrong!
[00:58:26.952 --> 00:58:28.613]  Believe me, I'm wrong about stuff every day.
[00:58:30.434 --> 00:58:30.835]  Alright?
[00:58:30.915 --> 00:58:33.156]  I mean, it's just... It doesn't even matter.
[00:58:33.196 --> 00:58:34.938]  Don't worry, America's gone, okay?
[00:58:35.198 --> 00:58:35.978]  That makes you happy.
[00:58:35.998 --> 00:58:36.659]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:40.701 --> 00:58:44.944]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.009 --> 00:58:57.670]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.330 --> 00:58:59.391]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.091 --> 00:59:01.192]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.853 --> 00:59:02.673]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.434 --> 00:59:04.374]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.015 --> 00:59:08.998]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.178 --> 00:59:13.301]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.501 --> 00:59:21.026]  If you just type Ron Paul's name into Google and click News, you'll see headlines like, Ron Paul and the Internet Nazis!
[00:59:21.426 --> 00:59:23.228]  Ron Paul's no conservative!
[00:59:23.268 --> 00:59:24.489]  Ron Paul's bad!
[00:59:24.549 --> 00:59:25.229]  Ron Paul!
[00:59:25.649 --> 00:59:26.270]  Ron Paul!
[00:59:27.305 --> 00:59:30.047]  We had a caller, Will, who I got mad at.
[00:59:30.087 --> 00:59:31.768]  I'm not trying to be personally mean to you, Will.
[00:59:32.469 --> 00:59:33.109]  But you heard him.
[00:59:33.149 --> 00:59:34.330]  Everybody was listening last hour.
[00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:37.472]  He calls in, he goes, Well, I disagree with something you said, and I kept saying, What is it?
[00:59:37.532 --> 00:59:37.872]  What is it?
[00:59:38.272 --> 00:59:46.377]  Well, I talked to the guy up there in Iowa, and he called me back, and he was, you just liked it that some bigwig called you back and was friendly to you.
[00:59:47.078 --> 00:59:49.620]  Well, you're the first reasonable person who's called me, Will.
[00:59:50.940 --> 00:59:54.683]  You know, we just made the decision because he doesn't really show in the polls to have him here.
[00:59:56.076 --> 00:59:57.717]  But he's not really barred.
[00:59:57.737 --> 01:00:00.218]  See, minimal gymnastics.
[01:00:01.799 --> 01:00:07.622]  Ron Paul, if they would give him attention, would clearly end up winning the Republican nomination.
[01:00:07.902 --> 01:00:11.284]  He's popular with Democrats, he's popular with Republicans, he's popular with Libertarians.
[01:00:11.784 --> 01:00:17.747]  Ron Paul wins every major debate in the polls, when they have the debates, and then everyone attacks him.
[01:00:19.828 --> 01:00:20.829]  It's just amazing spin.
[01:00:20.849 --> 01:00:21.909]  He has been barred.
[01:00:21.929 --> 01:00:23.270]  He did request to be part of it.
[01:00:24.227 --> 01:00:26.028]  Okay, of this Iowa meeting.
[01:00:26.948 --> 01:00:29.870]  And I just, when I hear spin, it gives me a headache.
[01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:31.491]  I'm going to be quite frank with you.
[01:00:33.132 --> 01:00:35.353]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in California.
[01:00:35.373 --> 01:00:35.833]  You're on the air.
[01:00:35.853 --> 01:00:36.433]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:00:37.174 --> 01:00:38.414]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:00:38.434 --> 01:00:40.716]  Doing a little better after that last call on May.
[01:00:42.036 --> 01:00:44.718]  Hey, I got a little bit of beef with you, but I think you're going to like this one.
[01:00:45.738 --> 01:00:49.040]  So on your website, you've got America's last hope for Ron Paul.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:53.182]  You know, you're putting a target on his back with that sort of statement.
[01:00:54.082 --> 01:01:15.497]  Yeah, what we've got is a nation of armchair quarterbacks where most people have been trained in a procrastination mode to simply nitpick anyone who's taking action and then never really take action themselves and then engage in mental gymnastics to attack anyone taking action so that you never have to take action.
[01:01:16.443 --> 01:01:18.404]  Okay, well you're talking to the wrong guy there.
[01:01:18.444 --> 01:01:21.765]  I've been taking plenty of action almost as long as you have, so you're talking to the wrong guy.
[01:01:22.186 --> 01:01:23.706]  I'm just telling you... Don't worry, don't worry.
[01:01:23.726 --> 01:01:32.990]  They devalue your dollar, and you're calling into a show where we have a banner up on the website trying to promote Ron Paul, and you're saying somehow we're bad.
[01:01:33.010 --> 01:01:36.052]  No, I'm trying to give you positive advice.
[01:01:36.072 --> 01:01:37.652]  You're playing right into the fly-off, dude.
[01:01:38.233 --> 01:01:38.693]  You know it.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.021]  Well, you know what?
[01:01:41.061 --> 01:01:44.042]  You put out a deal like that where you say that you're the last hope.
[01:01:44.062 --> 01:01:45.203]  What do you think they're going to do?
[01:01:45.523 --> 01:01:46.824]  They take down our last hope.
[01:01:47.284 --> 01:01:50.226]  Deflate us emotionally.
[01:01:50.246 --> 01:01:55.950]  Well, I think the statement could be taken to the last hope in this election in this spectrum.
[01:01:56.290 --> 01:01:59.532]  But it's not America's last hope.
[01:01:59.572 --> 01:02:00.893]  And that's what Watson put up there.
[01:02:00.973 --> 01:02:01.874]  But I actually like it.
[01:02:02.654 --> 01:02:04.715]  And it's actually been adopted by a lot of people out there.
[01:02:04.735 --> 01:02:05.476]  And I think it's great.
[01:02:06.716 --> 01:02:12.078]  You notice that after we said that, the Ron Paul campaign, that's been up for months, started saying, uh, hope for America.
[01:02:12.598 --> 01:02:15.739]  So, uh, I really appreciate, uh, your, your call.
[01:02:16.819 --> 01:02:18.419]  But see what's going on here, folks.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:31.083]  We're not talking about how they're coming up and now telling churches coast to coast not to talk about politics, not to talk about issues, don't talk about immigration, don't talk about the war, when that's their total First Amendment right to do that.
[01:02:32.426 --> 01:02:35.007]  We're not talking about how they're saying they want to start restricting talk radio.
[01:02:35.448 --> 01:02:37.429]  Or how they want to shut down free speech on the web.
[01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:39.490]  It's about Alex Jones.
[01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:42.471]  And I understand the psychology.
[01:02:42.571 --> 01:02:45.293]  I mean, I get up here on air and I bring up a lot of bad things that are happening.
[01:02:45.653 --> 01:02:48.474]  People get frustrated with the things and kind of kill the messenger.
[01:02:51.681 --> 01:02:54.943]  But at the same time, you know, we have to show people how bad it is.
[01:02:55.063 --> 01:03:01.148]  It's like the committees of correspondence in the decade that led up to 1776 and the kickoff of the Revolutionary War.
[01:03:01.488 --> 01:03:10.554]  They listed, and they corresponded, and they documented the criminal activity, and they impeached the credibility of the illegitimate government led by King George III.
[01:03:12.076 --> 01:03:13.497]  And that's what we're doing here.
[01:03:14.737 --> 01:03:16.379]  There's a whole other thing to this.
[01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:19.441]  I have my website, PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:03:21.261 --> 01:03:22.462]  And I do what I do.
[01:03:23.022 --> 01:03:24.923]  It's not like communal property here.
[01:03:25.764 --> 01:03:34.329]  And, uh, everybody's always telling me, I gotta promote this, I gotta push that, I gotta have this person on, I gotta... No, it's my show, my website, so you're welcome to call into it.
[01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:42.033]  But, uh, also, you can get overly into how everything's a Psy-Op, and how everything can be used for a Psy-Op.
[01:03:42.533 --> 01:03:43.474]  Just take action.
[01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.495]  Just get involved.
[01:03:45.955 --> 01:03:46.936]  None of us are gonna be perfect.
[01:03:46.956 --> 01:03:49.517]  If you worry about being perfect all day, you're never gonna get anything done.
[01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:50.858]  We'll come back, take more calls.
[01:03:55.834 --> 01:04:01.299]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:01.659 --> 01:04:09.306]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.986 --> 01:04:17.030]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.450 --> 01:04:28.956]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.176 --> 01:04:32.678]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.139 --> 01:04:35.080]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:39.242]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:52.745 --> 01:04:55.907]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:55.947 --> 01:04:59.989]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:02.670]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:05.071]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:05.251 --> 01:05:13.695]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:13.775 --> 01:05:15.076]  The Brookie light is different.
[01:05:15.216 --> 01:05:19.258]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:19.318 --> 01:05:19.959]  We're good to go!
[01:05:39.633 --> 01:05:44.937]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.

[01:06:57.250 --> 01:06:57.891]  Big Brother.
[01:06:58.551 --> 01:06:59.632]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.313 --> 01:07:01.453]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.094 --> 01:07:02.895]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.655 --> 01:07:04.516]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.916 --> 01:07:09.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.523]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.284 --> 01:07:17.546]  Everyone will want to go to PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:07:18.187 --> 01:07:25.613]  Momentous news, if it is not another disinfo move, which it clearly could be.
[01:07:27.563 --> 01:07:35.466]  This will be the first major legislative defeat for Bush on one of his big New World Order agenda issues, items.
[01:07:36.566 --> 01:07:38.347]  Senate blocks immigration bill.
[01:07:38.967 --> 01:07:45.389]  The Senate drove a stake Thursday through President Bush's plan to legalize millions of unlawful immigrants.
[01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.731]  Likely postponing.
[01:07:48.751 --> 01:07:49.531]  You heard that likely?
[01:07:49.551 --> 01:07:52.172]  You heard that five times last month.
[01:07:52.854 --> 01:08:08.423]  Major action on immigration until after the 2008 elections, but Democrats are saying they may add pieces of the bill onto other bills as riders, then like a Lego set, put it all together on the other side.
[01:08:10.063 --> 01:08:10.944]  So the fight's not over.
[01:08:11.986 --> 01:08:22.992]  The bill's supporters fell 14 votes short of the 60 needed to limit debate and clear the way for final passage of the legislation, which critics assailed as offering amnesty to illegal aliens.
[01:08:23.632 --> 01:08:27.734]  The vote was 14 to 53 in favor of limiting the debate.
[01:08:28.314 --> 01:08:31.516]  Why didn't the AP just go read the bill and see where it says amnesty?
[01:08:31.956 --> 01:08:33.457]  They have to say, oh critics claim
[01:08:35.029 --> 01:08:46.796]  Senators in both parties said the issue is so volatile that Congress is highly unlikely to revisit it this fall or next year when the presidential election will increasingly dominate American politics.
[01:08:47.196 --> 01:08:58.262]  Yeah, they don't want to make it a political issue so we'll get somebody elected who'll defend our borders and our sovereignty from a highly nationalistic foreign groups who openly say this belongs to Mexico.
[01:08:59.588 --> 01:09:07.681]  A similar effort collapsed in the Congress last year and the House has not bothered with an immigration bill this year awaiting Senate action.
[01:09:09.255 --> 01:09:22.725]  The vote was a stinging setback for Bush who advocated the bill as an imperfect but necessary fix for current immigration practices in which many illegal immigrants used forged documents or lamped visas to live and work in the United States.
[01:09:22.865 --> 01:09:31.932]  No, we have a federal and state governments and many city governments that have a two-tiered system where citizens have the book thrown at them for having a crooked toenail.
[01:09:32.012 --> 01:09:38.617]  We get white glove inspections by the police while the illegals can basically do no wrong and are above the law.
[01:09:40.473 --> 01:09:41.414]  That's what's going on.
[01:09:45.197 --> 01:09:54.965]  This is a great victory, because earlier in the week, a lot of experts were saying it could pass the Senate and then pass the House, because the Democrats now dominate both chambers.
[01:09:56.566 --> 01:10:02.892]  But you made the phone calls, you wrote the letters, you traveled to D.C., you demonstrated, you went into the Capitol halls.
[01:10:02.992 --> 01:10:08.056]  Most importantly, when your Senators and House members came back to their districts, you went to the
[01:10:09.099 --> 01:10:10.780]  Library, when they were there giving a speech.
[01:10:11.181 --> 01:10:12.381]  You went to the local church.
[01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:15.403]  You went to the grocery store where they were having a meet and greet.
[01:10:15.484 --> 01:10:19.166]  You went to the coffee and cookie meetings on Sunday nights.
[01:10:19.766 --> 01:10:21.408]  You got in their faces!
[01:10:22.088 --> 01:10:23.889]  And it's that physical action.
[01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:27.612]  They're humans too, and that gets to them, folks.
[01:10:29.173 --> 01:10:31.154]  This is a major victory.
[01:10:32.315 --> 01:10:35.697]  Now, they may play some trick in the next few days or next week.
[01:10:35.978 --> 01:10:36.458]  Believe me.
[01:10:37.703 --> 01:10:43.789]  This is their past activity, but this is great news, and please go to PrisonPlanet.com and get this article out to everybody.
[01:10:44.049 --> 01:10:49.614]  We need to get a story up on PrisonPlanet.com basically about how this saga played out and where we're going in the future.
[01:10:50.254 --> 01:10:53.557]  I've heard two different neocons this morning putting out basic disinfo.
[01:10:53.978 --> 01:10:59.823]  I don't know whether they're just stupid or whether this is consciously disinfo, saying that
[01:11:03.647 --> 01:11:07.969]  The Republicans were for this, and Democrats were for this, because they want Hispanic votes.
[01:11:11.190 --> 01:11:12.971]  And because Mexican-Americans want this.
[01:11:14.111 --> 01:11:16.652]  Basic Gallup polls show that is not the case.
[01:11:18.093 --> 01:11:26.136]  So it's very dangerous to have talk radio going along with CNN and Fox with the hoax that Hispanics want open borders.
[01:11:28.457 --> 01:11:33.259]  Here's an example, when Bob Dole was running against Bill Clinton, of the tactic they're using, and I'll go to your calls,
[01:11:35.649 --> 01:11:41.492]  Only about five percent, I remember reading the numbers, of women more so were going to vote for Bill Clinton than for Bob Dole.
[01:11:41.732 --> 01:11:51.878]  But they ran headlines across the country, part of a psyops, clearly, saying women support Clinton.
[01:11:53.319 --> 01:11:54.559]  Women lean towards Clinton.
[01:11:54.619 --> 01:11:55.580]  Women like Clinton.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.922]  And saying the poll numbers show he was way ahead.
[01:11:59.222 --> 01:12:03.284]  And then women heard that and said, oh, well I better be for Clinton then.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.742]  I'm not debating Bob Dole, Bill Clinton.
[01:12:06.982 --> 01:12:08.083]  That was staged as well.
[01:12:08.524 --> 01:12:12.047]  Bob Dole had no intention of being president and just didn't even basically campaign.
[01:12:13.308 --> 01:12:15.290]  Just like Republicans aren't campaigning right now.
[01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:16.671]  It's just to be given to Hillary.
[01:12:17.913 --> 01:12:19.294]  They just passed the baton.
[01:12:19.314 --> 01:12:20.335]  It's called power sharing.
[01:12:23.419 --> 01:12:25.580]  I know you know that, but we have new listeners that don't, folks.
[01:12:26.501 --> 01:12:27.961]  The country doesn't yet understand that.
[01:12:27.981 --> 01:12:32.884]  They're starting to understand that, with Congress with a 14% approval rating and the President in the mid-twenties now.
[01:12:32.904 --> 01:12:35.265]  I mean, this is the first time, again, both parties are out of favor.
[01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:39.287]  They usually double-team us and trick us with good cop, bad cop.
[01:12:40.467 --> 01:12:42.729]  And I know you know that, but that's key for those that don't.
[01:12:43.869 --> 01:12:44.910]  This is literal theater.
[01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:46.250]  The ultimate theater.
[01:12:47.291 --> 01:12:48.791]  This is about global power, folks.
[01:12:48.811 --> 01:12:49.772]  You better believe there's theater.
[01:12:53.527 --> 01:12:58.048]  And so, neocons are saying, yeah, yeah, you know, Bush was doing this because he wanted Hispanics to like him.
[01:13:00.349 --> 01:13:07.491]  Putting out the hoax that Hispanics don't care about America and don't want sovereignty and aren't upset about illegal aliens.
[01:13:08.011 --> 01:13:17.154]  The media is making this a racial issue instead of an economic issue and a national issue, a nationalistic issue.
[01:13:19.354 --> 01:13:20.955]  But everybody should be really pleased
[01:13:21.938 --> 01:13:26.359]  And really excited about this, but it doesn't mean... Now this was the big move this week.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.900]  And now they have lost a lot of steam.
[01:13:32.201 --> 01:13:36.082]  So... Good job, folks, and thank God.
[01:13:37.543 --> 01:13:38.863]  Let's go to Chris in Mass.
[01:13:38.903 --> 01:13:39.583]  Chris, you're on the air.
[01:13:39.603 --> 01:13:42.944]  It's my first time caller.
[01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:51.527]  I wanted to know what you think of net neutrality because I saw Ron Paul on G4TV's Attack of the Show and
[01:13:52.185 --> 01:13:54.586]  He said that he voted against net neutrality.
[01:13:54.626 --> 01:13:57.467]  I just want to know what your thoughts are on net neutrality.
[01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:01.348]  Well, you misunderstood Congressman Ron Paul.
[01:14:02.448 --> 01:14:15.092]  Ron Paul, consistently, he voted against the biggest gun control legislation since 1968, the Gun Control Act.
[01:14:16.272 --> 01:14:19.513]  And then Neocons put out this info that he was for gun control.
[01:14:21.209 --> 01:14:25.390]  He has voted against the 150 plus million dollar lobbying package.
[01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:27.711]  That's how much the AP reported was spent.
[01:14:27.731 --> 01:14:29.052]  It said more than 150 mil.
[01:14:29.312 --> 01:14:29.732]  We don't know.
[01:14:29.772 --> 01:14:31.092]  They just said over 150 mil.
[01:14:31.932 --> 01:14:33.953]  On trying to end net neutrality.
[01:14:34.453 --> 01:14:48.958]  And Ron Paul went on the floor and championed and actually led several caucuses with the Liberty Committee leading that to defeat it narrowly by four votes in the House.
[01:14:50.939 --> 01:14:52.520]  Was it four votes or six?
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:14:57.502]  Just a few votes, so... I guess I did misunderstand him.
[01:14:58.583 --> 01:15:01.284]  Alright, well, uh... But listen, don't believe me!
[01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:13.771]  I want you to go to the House of Representatives website, and I want you to go find that bill, and you can find the record of the yays and nays.
[01:15:15.111 --> 01:15:15.952]  What's the bill called?
[01:15:17.608 --> 01:15:23.929]  It was a Telecommunications Regulatory Act last year.
[01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:25.430]  No, I don't remember the number.
[01:15:25.450 --> 01:15:26.510]  It had several different versions.
[01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:29.771]  You can do a little bit of poking around.
[01:15:30.511 --> 01:15:32.331]  I can find it in about two minutes.
[01:15:32.991 --> 01:15:34.832]  It was all over the news.
[01:15:38.833 --> 01:15:39.733]  My memory is failing me.
[01:15:39.753 --> 01:15:42.474]  It was the big telecommunications package.
[01:15:42.534 --> 01:15:44.454]  It had hundreds of things in it.
[01:15:45.248 --> 01:15:47.370]  But in it, it had the end of net neutrality.
[01:15:47.790 --> 01:15:50.592]  Which for those who don't know what that means, it would be the end of the internet.
[01:15:51.253 --> 01:16:02.261]  I mean, if you have a high-level backbone provider, and there's only about 50 of them in this country, and only a few hundred worldwide, just when they're down, large sections of the web is down.
[01:16:03.302 --> 01:16:03.602]  Okay?
[01:16:03.923 --> 01:16:05.584]  And that would just be one of them being down.
[01:16:06.385 --> 01:16:06.725]  Okay?
[01:16:06.745 --> 01:16:08.146]  Because it all is interconnected.
[01:16:08.807 --> 01:16:10.468]  We're talking about companies
[01:16:11.224 --> 01:16:29.155]  Going out and making you pay as a website, and again it would be under their contractual auspices, where if they wanted to let you pay, they wouldn't even be forced to let you pay them, to then let your traffic go over their backbone.
[01:16:30.256 --> 01:16:34.419]  And again, then they argue, well see we're not being paid for this.
[01:16:34.439 --> 01:16:36.660]  Well they're being paid by all the internet connections they sell.
[01:16:39.073 --> 01:16:41.615]  And it's been hugely profitable for the big phone companies.
[01:16:42.335 --> 01:16:45.497]  So, I mean, would you like to comment on what you thought you heard Ron Paul say?
[01:16:51.118 --> 01:16:58.023]  Basically, he asked him, well, you're such a big thing on the internet, then why did you vote against net neutrality?
[01:16:58.043 --> 01:17:03.086]  And he said that, well, he said that, um, I think the video's on his website.
[01:17:03.547 --> 01:17:07.209]  I could look at it right now, but I'm looking for the telecommunications bill.
[01:17:08.450 --> 01:17:10.251]  RonPoll2008.com?
[01:17:10.812 --> 01:17:11.072]  Yes.
[01:17:12.653 --> 01:17:16.636]  It's actually the first video on the little scroll of videos he has.
[01:17:16.756 --> 01:17:19.498]  G4TV, attack of the show.
[01:17:20.746 --> 01:17:26.635]  No, he said that it had some regulations in it, and I didn't know what regulations those were.
[01:17:26.655 --> 01:17:29.599]  And I kind of got confused.
[01:17:29.699 --> 01:17:32.023]  It is at RonPaul2008.com, John.
[01:17:32.063 --> 01:17:32.784]  Will you go grab that?
[01:17:34.557 --> 01:17:35.358]  It's a top link.
[01:17:35.418 --> 01:17:35.718]  Okay.
[01:17:36.358 --> 01:17:47.086]  I watched Ron Paul on C-SPAN live debate against the bill, and the bill, sir, was not for net neutrality.
[01:17:47.106 --> 01:17:47.886]  It was the opposite.
[01:17:48.627 --> 01:17:49.868]  So it just sounds like... I believe you.
[01:17:50.048 --> 01:17:50.708]  I believe you.
[01:17:50.828 --> 01:17:51.689]  You're getting me wrong.
[01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:53.710]  Well, I don't want you to believe me.
[01:17:53.730 --> 01:17:54.411]  I appreciate your call.
[01:17:55.452 --> 01:17:56.853]  I want you to go find out for yourself.
[01:17:57.393 --> 01:18:00.295]  I haven't watched this video yet, but we will play it coming up.
[01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:03.911]  I mean hell, don't vote for Ron Paul then.
[01:18:04.292 --> 01:18:09.555]  Go vote for Rudolph Giuliani.
[01:18:10.756 --> 01:18:11.576]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:18:12.837 --> 01:18:20.943]  You heard the guy last hour saying that I was wrong, that Ron Paul hadn't been barred from the Iowa panel.
[01:18:22.004 --> 01:18:23.865]  He said they just aren't having him.
[01:18:24.765 --> 01:18:26.487]  But I'm like, that is barred.
[01:18:26.567 --> 01:18:27.407]  They barred him.
[01:18:27.447 --> 01:18:28.148]  They blocked him.
[01:18:28.788 --> 01:18:29.709]  They didn't invite him.
[01:18:30.758 --> 01:18:32.060]  Kind of a lawyerly debate.
[01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:39.227]  But they did invite, you know, it is a Christian group that's sponsoring it, of course, so they did invite Giuliani.
[01:18:40.829 --> 01:18:46.115]  Maybe if he was for abortion, maybe if Ron Paul was for abortion, he would have gotten invited.
[01:18:46.155 --> 01:18:49.018]  But he's not, so the Christians didn't invite him.
[01:18:52.765 --> 01:18:57.867]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:18:57.927 --> 01:19:05.249]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:19:05.389 --> 01:19:16.052]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:19:16.213 --> 01:19:20.774]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:19:21.054 --> 01:19:26.041]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[01:19:26.261 --> 01:19:29.185]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:29.425 --> 01:19:39.238]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:19:50.024 --> 01:19:50.524]  That's $667.28, $329.30, and $164.65.
[01:20:07.714 --> 01:20:13.756]  70% of China's 1 trillion reserves are in dollar, now purchasing 250,000 barrels of oil per day from Iran in euro.
[01:20:13.856 --> 01:20:17.518]  Japanese refiners buy 550,000 barrels, switching dollar to yen.
[01:20:17.578 --> 01:20:18.518]  Bad news for U.S.
[01:20:18.578 --> 01:20:19.018]  currency.
[01:20:19.259 --> 01:20:21.439]  China and Japan hold large positions in dollar.
[01:20:21.599 --> 01:20:22.960]  Trading equals permanent loss.

[01:20:53.197 --> 01:20:54.918]  Government is best, which governs least.

[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.382]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:20:59.742 --> 01:21:02.504]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:21:03.045 --> 01:21:09.790]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:23:16.943 --> 01:23:21.925]  We've got Ron Paul on Neil Camuto yesterday, talking about the Brown family.
[01:23:21.945 --> 01:23:22.566]  That's coming up.
[01:23:25.587 --> 01:23:30.789]  Also, we're going to play the clip of Ron Paul talking about net neutrality.
[01:23:31.469 --> 01:23:33.310]  Find out what exactly is going on here.
[01:23:35.031 --> 01:23:39.593]  And then we will also continue with your calls.
[01:23:39.633 --> 01:23:41.734]  We have Michael, who's a friend of mine, who called in.
[01:23:42.856 --> 01:23:46.359]  Who is, uh, I don't want to get the terms mixed up, but he's paralyzed from the chest down.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:48.500]  The cop didn't believe it.
[01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:52.743]  Thought his hand controls were weapons or something and beat him up pretty bad in front of his wife.
[01:23:53.584 --> 01:24:03.531]  So we'll get him to pop in and talk about that since I mentioned it last hour with this cop beating up these, uh, 11 and 12 year old kids who were politely saying, please stop, sir.
[01:24:03.932 --> 01:24:04.892]  Please don't choke us.
[01:24:05.533 --> 01:24:07.634]  We're sorry, sir, for skateboarding.
[01:24:07.674 --> 01:24:08.995]  And the cop just goes nuts.
[01:24:09.596 --> 01:24:10.997]  But praise God, good news.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:18.903]  They took Raymond Schwab's son from him and said, you shouldn't be involved in 9-11 Truth.
[01:24:19.683 --> 01:24:23.045]  Cops out on the road, of course, made phone calls and tried to CPS his child.
[01:24:23.405 --> 01:24:29.248]  Just this summer, they're in an RV, they have an RV following them, they walk across the country, anti-war, 9-11 Truth.
[01:24:29.828 --> 01:24:35.310]  We got cops on video saying that by protesting the war, they're protesting the troops' rights.
[01:24:35.610 --> 01:24:36.431]  That's how they twist it.
[01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:39.032]  You're hurting our troops' rights by protesting.
[01:24:39.597 --> 01:24:43.279]  They try to tell them we'll charge you with felony for videotaping the cops when they come up to you.
[01:24:45.061 --> 01:24:46.382]  They went to the CPS meeting.
[01:24:46.402 --> 01:24:48.203]  They've seized the child for weeks now.
[01:24:48.663 --> 01:24:52.746]  They were just yesterday talking about forced drugging the seven-year-old because he's crying.
[01:24:52.766 --> 01:24:55.908]  And when you cry, taken from your mother and father, that's mental illness.
[01:24:55.928 --> 01:24:56.768]  So then they drug you.
[01:24:57.009 --> 01:24:59.150]  Then they get double and then triple the federal money.
[01:25:00.231 --> 01:25:01.932]  They literally drug almost all of them.
[01:25:01.992 --> 01:25:02.912]  It's over 90%.
[01:25:04.013 --> 01:25:07.255]  Really bad stuff's been happening to the young boy in CPS custody.
[01:25:07.275 --> 01:25:08.136]  We don't want to get into that.
[01:25:09.166 --> 01:25:11.788]  But supposedly now they're going to get the child back in two weeks.
[01:25:12.268 --> 01:25:13.588]  Raymond, this is wonderful news.
[01:25:13.628 --> 01:25:16.510]  Tell folks what happened in that Kansas family courtroom.
[01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:18.191]  What developed today?
[01:25:19.231 --> 01:25:19.952]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:25:20.072 --> 01:25:23.533]  We sat outside the courtroom and waited and waited and waited.
[01:25:23.573 --> 01:25:24.794]  My attorney never showed up.
[01:25:25.114 --> 01:25:25.975]  Court appointed.
[01:25:26.755 --> 01:25:34.459]  And all of a sudden all the case managers came out and said that the case had been postponed until September, months from now.
[01:25:35.023 --> 01:25:39.084]  My wife broke down in tears, you know, started crying out why she didn't understand.
[01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:48.828]  And I just, you know, the righteous indignation of the Lord rose up in me and I started telling them all that I was going public, I wasn't going to be nice any longer.
[01:25:48.848 --> 01:25:53.329]  I gathered all the social workers around and, you know, they knew.
[01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:57.150]  They were sitting there dumbfounded as I told them, you know these things are false.
[01:25:57.571 --> 01:26:00.111]  You know these allegations are false.
[01:26:00.131 --> 01:26:01.552]  You guys have seen the evidence.
[01:26:01.952 --> 01:26:04.053]  I can't believe that someone can't just walk in there and
[01:26:05.311 --> 01:26:11.755]  Say something to the judge, file a motion, do something, and then all of a sudden they called an emergency meeting.
[01:26:12.055 --> 01:26:20.541]  They made me leave the courthouse because people were frightened that I was angry that they were making a stay for months with my son in foster care.
[01:26:21.221 --> 01:26:33.709]  They came out and said that they set it for July 12th and two weeks for dismissal, that there are legal reasons why they had to do it that way, that the state of Kansas has no jurisdiction over us.
[01:26:34.508 --> 01:26:37.210]  Standing there with the case manager, the county attorney came up.
[01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:43.655]  She didn't know that I was the stepfather and told the case worker that she was confident the case was going to be dismissed.
[01:26:44.096 --> 01:26:55.445]  She said she didn't even want to sign the order in the first place, but the head county attorney obviously had a grudge against us and forced her to sign it, is what she said, which that's interesting information to know.
[01:26:55.605 --> 01:26:56.786]  I'd like to speak to that man.
[01:26:58.644 --> 01:27:04.092]  For all intents and purposes, the case manager looked at her and said, how good are the odds you think this case is going to be thrown out?
[01:27:04.112 --> 01:27:04.613]  And she says, 100%.
[01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:08.711]  And I was the county attorney that filed in the first place.
[01:27:09.051 --> 01:27:11.052]  Okay, so let's be clear here.
[01:27:11.472 --> 01:27:13.412]  Your wife is a genetic mother.
[01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:18.014]  The boy hasn't been with his father in many, many, many years.
[01:27:18.634 --> 01:27:22.615]  This is just a whole separate case where you guys are out there and they call CPS on you.
[01:27:23.035 --> 01:27:25.356]  And so this is just really, really exciting news.
[01:27:26.757 --> 01:27:27.577]  Now you did it.
[01:27:27.757 --> 01:27:33.059]  I advise you to turn the other cheek and be friendly to them because they feel like it's all gang mentality.
[01:27:33.099 --> 01:27:34.299]  They feel like they've been dissed.
[01:27:34.859 --> 01:27:37.702]  They may try to create new charges or something even worse.
[01:27:38.042 --> 01:27:51.313]  It's important with these gang members to now not make them feel that they've been dissed and to just shake their hand and be friendly and then there's a good chance they may end the kidnapping.
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:52.740]  I agree.
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:56.702]  Alex, the last time that you spoke about this, before I came on the show, the day before I came on the show, they called me and
[01:28:19.637 --> 01:28:24.998]  I guess the first time people called, they believed it was me and my family making these prank calls.
[01:28:25.438 --> 01:28:27.639]  And they said, now we know it's not you.
[01:28:27.939 --> 01:28:29.139]  We're very, very sorry.
[01:28:29.179 --> 01:28:31.700]  We're going to recommend your son gets placed back in your care.
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:32.780]  I didn't believe them then.
[01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.741]  I was like... Stay there, stay there.
[01:28:35.781 --> 01:28:38.221]  Let's finish up on the other side, then I'll get into Ron Paul and all your calls.
[01:28:42.942 --> 01:28:43.902]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.343 --> 01:28:45.843]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.864 --> 01:28:49.531]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.342 --> 01:28:56.866]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Deagle of the Nutri-Medical Report here on Genesis.

[01:29:57.953 --> 01:30:05.236]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Border, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:30:05.256 --> 01:30:16.660]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network, Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:17.180]  Central.
[01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:23.142]  Formidable Alex Jones says, this is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:30:23.482 --> 01:30:29.384]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:30:29.865 --> 01:30:34.626]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:30:35.007 --> 01:30:39.788]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:41.529]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:30:41.589 --> 01:30:42.009]  Central.
[01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:50.012]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, trumpetsmen.org.
[01:30:53.092 --> 01:30:59.913]  You want to lose weight, but there's no way you want to resort to pills or shakes that are full of chemicals or drugs with harmful side effects.
[01:31:00.416 --> 01:31:01.677]  We know diets don't work.
[01:31:01.977 --> 01:31:03.838]  That's why there's the Fat Loss Patch.
[01:31:04.018 --> 01:31:11.041]  The Fat Loss Patch is a self-adhesive dietary aid worn daily that slowly releases all natural ingredients into the skin.
[01:31:11.241 --> 01:31:21.886]  The result is a safe and easy way for you to increase your energy levels, maintain a healthy body weight, incur those horrible sugar cravings, all without irritating side effects or loss of muscle.
[01:31:22.086 --> 01:31:25.007]  Just peel it off, stick it on, and live your life!
[01:31:25.487 --> 01:31:28.309]  The Patch is safe, effective, and clinically tested.
[01:31:28.449 --> 01:31:33.311]  Also, the Fat Loss Patch is the most unique product and business opportunity to ever hit the U.S.
[01:31:33.451 --> 01:31:34.612]  and international markets.
[01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:35.993]  Join as a U.S.
[01:31:36.093 --> 01:31:40.455]  or European customer or distributor in this much-needed and fast-growing business.
[01:31:40.755 --> 01:31:44.837]  For more information, visit PatchMeeting.com or call Judy at 800-766-2133.
[01:31:44.917 --> 01:31:45.117]  That's 800-766-2133.
[01:31:56.615 --> 01:31:57.478]  Yeah.
[01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:11.181]  Let's get out of here.
[01:32:11.421 --> 01:32:15.222]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[01:32:15.723 --> 01:32:17.823]  Said a joker to the dean.
[01:32:20.064 --> 01:32:22.144]  There's too much confusion.
[01:32:24.465 --> 01:32:28.266]  I can't get no relief.
[01:32:28.586 --> 01:32:31.647]  Business man there, drink my wine.
[01:32:32.927 --> 01:32:34.668]  Come and dig my earth.
[01:32:36.429 --> 01:32:44.635]  I want to be clear, though, folks.
[01:32:44.655 --> 01:32:49.138]  You only turn to the chief some of the time.
[01:32:49.178 --> 01:32:52.000]  See, people don't know how to read the incredible knowledge in the Bible.
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:53.501]  Not claiming I do, either.
[01:32:53.941 --> 01:33:00.986]  But over time, it's just a time to live, a time to die, a time to reap, a time to show, a time to cry, a time to fight.
[01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:08.507]  And I guess that just comes with wisdom, which I don't have a lot of it, but I've got more than the general public, and I do feel my wisdom growing.
[01:33:08.527 --> 01:33:13.371]  And I've learned that the New World Order has wisdom, but they just use it for evil.
[01:33:15.712 --> 01:33:20.756]  Going back to Raymond Schwab, who, again, doing a walk across the country for 9-11 Truth and against the war.
[01:33:20.816 --> 01:33:21.516]  Very polite.
[01:33:22.837 --> 01:33:23.738]  Very upright.
[01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:25.879]  Very respectful.
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:29.262]  And it has illustrated this country as a complete police state.
[01:33:30.013 --> 01:33:33.578]  And all the prayers I know helped.
[01:33:35.020 --> 01:33:37.303]  Believe me, folks, I can feel your prayers for me.
[01:33:37.443 --> 01:33:42.070]  And people out there who are worldly or don't, who have never experienced
[01:33:43.353 --> 01:33:47.315]  I mean, even the mathematics of Einstein showed thousands of dimensions.
[01:33:47.735 --> 01:33:53.177]  The eye has not seen, the ear not heard the things that are going on that are not seen.
[01:33:53.738 --> 01:33:59.920]  Anyone who doesn't know that there's things not seen in this limited spectrum that we witness is blind.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:07.143]  We only see in a tiny area of the spectrum of the light wavelength, and that's just in this dimension.
[01:34:07.924 --> 01:34:10.965]  And I don't want to get off into all this, because this is a news program,
[01:34:12.037 --> 01:34:13.098]  But I believe in prayer.
[01:34:13.198 --> 01:34:13.939]  I know it's real.
[01:34:14.179 --> 01:34:15.841]  Scientific studies have shown it's real.
[01:34:16.542 --> 01:34:22.570]  Not just if someone themselves is praying and believes it when they're sick, but when others, and they don't even know, are praying for them.
[01:34:23.631 --> 01:34:24.272]  It's the same thing.
[01:34:24.292 --> 01:34:25.554]  They've done studies with plants.
[01:34:27.164 --> 01:34:28.845]  And people praying for plants.
[01:34:29.585 --> 01:34:30.105]  It's incredible.
[01:34:30.165 --> 01:34:33.187]  These are scientific university studies, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:33.407 --> 01:34:34.807]  There's something going on here.
[01:34:35.367 --> 01:34:37.508]  And again, who knows what's going to happen.
[01:34:37.528 --> 01:34:38.589]  We're not out of the woods yet on this.
[01:34:38.609 --> 01:34:39.509]  We need to continue to pray.
[01:34:39.889 --> 01:34:42.330]  And obviously there's so many hundreds of families that call me every day.
[01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:45.912]  I literally knew Raymond, already had him on as a guest.
[01:34:46.412 --> 01:34:47.292]  We can help Raymond.
[01:34:47.372 --> 01:34:51.814]  If we sat here and tried to help every family with CPS taking their children, a couple things would happen.
[01:34:52.489 --> 01:34:57.831]  We would ask you to call and make phone calls so much that when we did ask, no one would call anymore.
[01:34:58.792 --> 01:34:59.772]  We're already doing it too much.
[01:34:59.832 --> 01:35:00.732]  Call on immigration.
[01:35:00.772 --> 01:35:01.753]  Call for this family.
[01:35:02.213 --> 01:35:03.153]  Call on this issue.
[01:35:03.193 --> 01:35:04.094]  Call on that issue.
[01:35:07.215 --> 01:35:08.195]  That we can't do that.
[01:35:08.475 --> 01:35:12.557]  And the whole show can't be people's children being taken because there's so much other stuff going on.
[01:35:13.197 --> 01:35:15.758]  And I have to just discern what I need to cover and what I need to do.
[01:35:15.818 --> 01:35:17.319]  Not that I do the best job either.
[01:35:18.419 --> 01:35:20.500]  But I want to go to your calls and all these clips we've got
[01:35:21.488 --> 01:35:25.150]  With all this news, I've not been getting to all the news lately, there's just so much of it.
[01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:28.311]  Raymond, though, the power of prayer, it really does work.
[01:35:30.912 --> 01:35:32.613]  I thank everybody that's emailed us.
[01:35:32.673 --> 01:35:35.615]  I do want to say, I just sat down with my wife, she's still pretty distraught.
[01:35:35.675 --> 01:35:38.876]  They're not going to allow her to have unsupervised visits for the next two weeks.
[01:35:38.896 --> 01:35:42.718]  They're going to isolate her somewhat from him, which does concern me.
[01:35:44.819 --> 01:35:48.040]  And with what happened, I give all glory to my Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:49.081]  It's nothing we've done.
[01:35:49.688 --> 01:35:56.732]  I do thank you for your help and everyone that's been praying for us because this has been a tremendous battle.
[01:35:57.692 --> 01:35:59.633]  The walk for truth is going to continue.
[01:35:59.673 --> 01:36:00.974]  I'm on my way to Indiana.
[01:36:01.374 --> 01:36:03.495]  My wife is going to stay with safe people here.
[01:36:04.182 --> 01:36:06.164]  Until the 12th, I'm going to come back and pick her up.
[01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:07.205]  So we're not out of the water.
[01:36:07.245 --> 01:36:08.526]  Our family's still split up.
[01:36:08.866 --> 01:36:24.420]  We still have a huge financial burden from this, but the Lord has been providing tremendously and we just need covering and prayer and for people just to keep an eye out because it's through us stopping these things and not allowing them to happen that we're continuing to win this fight and keep people informed.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:28.023]  And I do pray for all the other families out there that haven't had
[01:36:28.482 --> 01:36:31.663]  The blessing that I have, I don't know why God works the way He does.
[01:36:31.743 --> 01:36:35.785]  I'm not Him, but I know much more horrible things have happened to other people.
[01:36:35.845 --> 01:36:37.025]  My heart goes out to them.
[01:36:37.406 --> 01:36:38.726]  They're in my prayers as well.
[01:36:38.766 --> 01:36:43.688]  I've been very humbled through this whole experience, and we'll let you guys know what happens on the 12th.
[01:36:44.828 --> 01:36:47.850]  Well, as I told you during the last break, you're not out of the woods yet.
[01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:48.910]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:49.330 --> 01:36:50.971]  Because they're gonna try now.
[01:36:52.199 --> 01:36:54.320]  They may try now to get your son.
[01:36:55.021 --> 01:36:56.682]  They do this in many cities and towns.
[01:36:56.722 --> 01:36:58.243]  I don't know if they're this evil where you're at.
[01:36:59.283 --> 01:37:00.964]  Total wickedness has not descended yet.
[01:37:00.984 --> 01:37:03.065]  A lot of them are evil, they just don't know it.
[01:37:03.085 --> 01:37:06.868]  A lot of times they will deny food and water until they sign statements.
[01:37:08.369 --> 01:37:10.610]  That's standard, by the way.
[01:37:10.690 --> 01:37:11.050]  Torture.
[01:37:11.811 --> 01:37:15.032]  I'm not trying to scare people, folks, but they do torture small children.
[01:37:15.453 --> 01:37:16.213]  They don't even call it that.
[01:37:16.233 --> 01:37:17.454]  They call it pain compliance.
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:22.163]  And, uh, I mean, they'll have cops bend arms back, everything else.
[01:37:22.303 --> 01:37:23.364]  It's in public view.
[01:37:23.664 --> 01:37:26.386]  They just give evil things normal sounding names.
[01:37:27.227 --> 01:37:28.187]  And it's not a good sign.
[01:37:28.207 --> 01:37:32.691]  They don't want your child to have any... Well, now they're saying supervised visits?
[01:37:33.771 --> 01:37:46.501]  They're gonna give her supervised... Before they were allowing her to meet with him at the Boys and Girls Club and for him to come, she was actually staying at a crisis center, because in times past, this man that was trying to get, um, the child that threatened to kill her, beat her up,
[01:37:47.085 --> 01:37:49.466]  I mean, he's a very violent man, or was.
[01:37:49.546 --> 01:37:50.906]  I can't say that today.
[01:37:52.366 --> 01:37:54.627]  So they took her back in because she had nowhere to live.
[01:37:54.707 --> 01:37:58.768]  We couldn't bring everything back here quite yet because we're not planning on staying in Kansas.
[01:37:58.788 --> 01:38:00.248]  They tried to get me to move back here.
[01:38:00.288 --> 01:38:01.048]  I told them I wouldn't.
[01:38:01.068 --> 01:38:03.969]  Yeah, you guys have your home and everything in Colorado.
[01:38:04.229 --> 01:38:08.010]  They did this in Kansas, and so you're not going to let them stop you on the walk.
[01:38:08.190 --> 01:38:10.410]  They make her stay there, so she's staying there in the town.
[01:38:10.671 --> 01:38:12.071]  Okay, Raymond Schwab, God bless you.
[01:38:12.091 --> 01:38:12.851]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:38:13.511 --> 01:38:14.011]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:38:14.391 --> 01:38:16.612]  Absolutely amazing stuff happening out there.
[01:38:19.634 --> 01:38:22.835]  Let's go to Michael in Austin, Texas.
[01:38:23.335 --> 01:38:27.377]  He's the fellow last hour I was talking about with the already officer.
[01:38:27.417 --> 01:38:32.638]  He was already an officer, police officer, but I forget his position then.
[01:38:32.698 --> 01:38:34.019]  Now he's moved up even higher.
[01:38:34.499 --> 01:38:35.620]  I believe a supervisor.
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:39.661]  And yeah, he didn't know what hand controls were for somebody who's paralyzed.
[01:38:40.422 --> 01:38:41.442]  Hey Alex, always a pleasure.
[01:39:09.466 --> 01:39:20.250]  What's ironic is my wife and I were taking a small mini-vacation in Hot Springs, Arkansas about a week ago, and they were having a parade through the town and all these guys were blocking off traffic.
[01:39:20.890 --> 01:39:23.971]  You want to talk about being in a scene from They Live?
[01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:28.493]  I mean, these guys are pretty serious thugs.
[01:39:30.373 --> 01:39:33.214]  Well, see, we don't screen calls, so I didn't know that was what you were calling in about.
[01:39:33.335 --> 01:39:34.555]  Well, this happened a week ago.
[01:39:36.594 --> 01:39:38.555]  It looks like a parade is going on.
[01:39:38.615 --> 01:39:44.098]  You may have been there while this was... Hot Springs is a great little town to vacation in, so you were there.
[01:39:44.218 --> 01:39:45.259]  I mean, how were they behaving?
[01:39:45.299 --> 01:39:45.899]  How were they acting?
[01:39:45.919 --> 01:39:48.100]  It's like, Al-Qaeda's everywhere, all crazy-dyed.
[01:39:48.120 --> 01:39:48.721]  What were they doing?
[01:39:49.241 --> 01:39:49.982]  I was scared.
[01:39:50.062 --> 01:39:55.364]  We were looking for the hot mineral bath in the resort that gives the hot mineral bath.
[01:39:55.525 --> 01:39:57.586]  I was scared to ask directions from these guys.
[01:39:58.266 --> 01:40:00.307]  I mean, that's the front that they put on.
[01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:03.429]  A very militaristic front.
[01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:17.391]  Something of greater importance, personally, that I wanted to talk to you about is that my wife received a knock and talk at our home the day after the 9-11 Truth Symposium that I saw you.
[01:40:17.411 --> 01:40:25.752]  A couple of guys in a black truck, Dodge truck with a topper on it, supposedly cops, came to knock on the door.
[01:40:25.972 --> 01:40:34.354]  I wasn't home, and said that they had some sort of tip about me growing marijuana in my home.
[01:40:35.279 --> 01:40:43.822]  Scared my wife, told her that they wanted to be real quiet, real subtle, didn't want to disturb the neighbors, but wanted to come in the home and look around.
[01:40:44.922 --> 01:40:46.482]  She refused them in doing that.
[01:40:47.823 --> 01:40:55.585]  You need to, uh, everybody needs at least a $5 disposable 35mm with flash by the front door.
[01:40:56.551 --> 01:40:59.092]  I mean, even if you have a video camera, you'll have to fumble around and get it.
[01:40:59.132 --> 01:41:03.593]  It's best to just have the 35mm or to know how your cell phone works.
[01:41:04.173 --> 01:41:09.055]  I say that because every time I fumble around and try to use the video camera on it, I have to remember how to do it.
[01:41:09.375 --> 01:41:13.176]  But, I mean, it's like quick draw, like you're a gunslinger with those video cameras.
[01:41:13.636 --> 01:41:17.738]  For those that don't know, it started about 8 years ago in Phoenix.
[01:41:17.858 --> 01:41:18.818]  It spread to Dallas.
[01:41:19.463 --> 01:41:40.790]  They had a Dallas Morning News article last year where it said hundreds of homes a day in one of the suburbs, and it's an up-class area, they just come to the door, knock-knock, and when the wife's home alone, they case it, and they say, and you're probably not being singled out, sir, this is just tyranny for everybody, and they intimidate the woman and say, let us in, let us search, everything will be alright.
[01:41:41.631 --> 01:41:45.872]  And a lot of times it's in upscale areas too, a lot of times they'll drop
[01:41:46.497 --> 01:41:47.198]  We're good to go.
[01:42:15.010 --> 01:42:20.733]  Soon, maybe you couldn't get through on the air, but I wish I could get your wife on, who I've met, just a lovely person.
[01:42:20.993 --> 01:42:25.755]  Tell me, and again, you guys are, again, I'm not saying clean-cut people are better than anybody.
[01:42:25.795 --> 01:42:31.497]  My point is that it's Christian clean-cut families who are having the biggest attacks.
[01:42:32.437 --> 01:42:40.301]  And so my point is, in the past they did it to minorities and others they thought society would accept it with, wrongly.
[01:42:40.881 --> 01:42:43.322]  Now they're doing it to everybody, but describe the knock and talk.
[01:42:45.776 --> 01:42:47.518]  They beat on the door very loudly.
[01:42:47.598 --> 01:42:48.358]  I was not home.
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:55.043]  They asked her who she was, told her that they had a tip that I was growing marijuana in the home.
[01:42:56.585 --> 01:42:59.086]  They supposedly ran her driver's license.
[01:42:59.687 --> 01:43:05.491]  She told them that that would not be allowed, that she works for a Christian foster care agency.
[01:43:07.433 --> 01:43:11.836]  And they basically, you know, asked about me, where I worked.
[01:43:13.442 --> 01:43:16.203]  And where I could be found and asked if they could come in and look around.
[01:43:16.243 --> 01:43:17.823]  Now why didn't she get their ID?
[01:43:19.144 --> 01:43:20.144]  Uh, that's a good question.
[01:43:20.164 --> 01:43:22.205]  They didn't leave any card or anything.
[01:43:22.225 --> 01:43:31.727]  Um, you know what's ironic is I went out to the mailbox a few days ago and a marked police car pulled up behind me and it turned out to be a friend of mine.
[01:43:31.987 --> 01:43:34.648]  One of the good guys, one of the few good guys left.
[01:43:35.328 --> 01:43:36.409]  And I asked him about it.
[01:43:36.909 --> 01:43:37.929]  I told him what happened.
[01:43:38.973 --> 01:43:42.375]  He said, well somebody must have been calling in a prank on you.
[01:43:42.435 --> 01:43:46.576]  I said, well I don't have any enemies that I know of that are alive, joking around.
[01:43:46.596 --> 01:43:51.298]  He said, well except for Commander McNeil, and started laughing.
[01:43:52.219 --> 01:43:55.240]  He's a real tough guy, beats up people.
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:57.281]  You're paralyzed from where down?
[01:43:58.281 --> 01:43:59.842]  From about the top of my legs down.
[01:44:01.522 --> 01:44:08.690]  Commander McNeil got very angry because he couldn't yank me out of the car because I held myself against the steering wheel.
[01:44:08.730 --> 01:44:12.014]  He ripped my shirt, put a dent in my brand new truck.
[01:44:14.318 --> 01:44:15.819]  Just, just thug mentality.
[01:44:15.839 --> 01:44:16.739]  I, I, I don't.
[01:44:16.839 --> 01:44:20.861]  Now again, he asked what, because I'm going from memory five years ago, but he said, what are these?
[01:44:20.901 --> 01:44:21.921]  You got hand controls.
[01:44:22.281 --> 01:44:24.962]  I had sticks, uh, attached to the pedals.
[01:44:25.002 --> 01:44:26.483]  Cause my truck was brand new.
[01:44:26.563 --> 01:44:32.345]  My, my hand controls were going to be installed the first of the next week, a couple of days from when it happened.
[01:44:33.045 --> 01:44:38.667]  And he saw the sticks and I told him, I said, this is what I'm driving with my, you know, I'm having my hand controls installed Monday.
[01:44:38.687 --> 01:44:39.928]  I'm in a wheelchair.
[01:44:40.985 --> 01:44:46.187]  And you know, you originally taught me, Alex, that I had rights.
[01:44:46.507 --> 01:44:48.228]  You know, that I could stand up for myself.
[01:44:48.648 --> 01:44:51.449]  And I just let my opinion be known to this thug.
[01:44:52.049 --> 01:44:54.930]  And he ripped my shirt, tried to pull me out of the vehicle.
[01:44:54.950 --> 01:45:00.652]  You know, long story short, we tried to file a report with Internal Affairs.
[01:45:00.793 --> 01:45:01.973]  Nothing was done about it.
[01:45:02.903 --> 01:45:11.007]  The only sense of satisfaction we ever got from it was when Mike Hanson chased this guy down with a video camera when he was campaigning for sheriff.
[01:45:12.368 --> 01:45:20.112]  And that's why I wanted to take my hat off to these guys, Luke Rudowsky and these other truth squads out there with video cameras, because that's where the power is.
[01:45:20.172 --> 01:45:22.633]  You shine the light on these roaches and they scatter.
[01:45:23.193 --> 01:45:25.494]  And I just want to take my hat off to you guys.
[01:45:28.015 --> 01:45:30.997]  Now what did this, because he got promoted to commander after he did that, didn't he?
[01:45:31.568 --> 01:45:35.430]  Yeah, well my... So he was a supervisor then and then he got promoted?
[01:45:35.650 --> 01:45:39.292]  That's right, he was a supervisor of a certain section of Austin.
[01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:40.253]  Now he's commander.
[01:45:40.293 --> 01:45:47.837]  Well, my police officer friend told me the other day that he's supposedly over the narcotics division now.
[01:45:48.117 --> 01:45:50.379]  So I don't know if he's connected with this or not.
[01:45:51.361 --> 01:45:52.281]  It doesn't really matter.
[01:45:52.301 --> 01:46:02.744]  To go on the record, I've got a countertop herb garden with some Italian basil, some purple basil, some chives, and a couple of houseplants that look pretty sickly.
[01:46:03.224 --> 01:46:04.504]  And I'm not scared of you guys.
[01:46:04.564 --> 01:46:08.665]  And if you come and kick my door in and shoot my dog, I'm going to defend my home.
[01:46:09.545 --> 01:46:15.127]  And if I live through defending my home, I'm going to sue the pants off of you.
[01:46:15.367 --> 01:46:17.187]  I'm not scared of you guys any longer.
[01:46:17.867 --> 01:46:20.008]  I'm empowered.
[01:46:20.546 --> 01:46:21.986]  And the truth is on our side.
[01:46:22.747 --> 01:46:24.307]  Well, it is, Michael.
[01:46:24.347 --> 01:46:25.067]  God bless you.
[01:46:25.327 --> 01:46:45.352]  I mean, it's important what they look like, because if they were, uh, look like they were in really good shape, I mean, I could tell you right off if they were Pentagon, because they do have Pentagon guys, and they do drive black SUVs and Broncos, and they do go around harassing peace groups, 9-11 groups, there's literally tens of thousands of them.
[01:46:45.892 --> 01:46:48.773]  I mean, there are entire battalions in some states.
[01:46:49.469 --> 01:46:49.949]  I don't think so.
[01:47:15.026 --> 01:47:17.407]  They just... I mean, it's hell on earth, man.
[01:47:17.447 --> 01:47:20.368]  The country is literally a cesspit of evil.
[01:47:21.289 --> 01:47:23.410]  And the only people that are left alone are the illegal aliens.
[01:47:23.530 --> 01:47:26.731]  I literally sometimes wish I was an illegal alien Mexican so I could just be left alone.
[01:47:27.572 --> 01:47:28.292]  Seriously, folks.
[01:47:28.332 --> 01:47:31.833]  I literally sometimes wish that my name was like Paco Garcia or something.
[01:47:32.534 --> 01:47:34.194]  I mean, just so I could be left alone.
[01:47:34.815 --> 01:47:36.836]  And it's scary.
[01:47:36.876 --> 01:47:42.118]  And just to know that they ship the junk in so they can then run around and put everybody in prison for using it.
[01:47:43.605 --> 01:47:50.048]  Yeah, and I told the story of my buddy who I knew in college.
[01:47:50.468 --> 01:47:53.689]  He lived in apartments of mine and they didn't even drink or smoke.
[01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:54.949]  They were fitness addicts.
[01:47:56.430 --> 01:48:04.793]  He and his girlfriend now married and they had the carpet cleaner in their house and she was growing like orchids or something for botany class at UT.
[01:48:05.433 --> 01:48:10.155]  Nothing looked anywhere like marijuana but just the grow lights and so the SWAT team hit them.
[01:48:12.472 --> 01:48:14.493]  But at least there, they thought there was something.
[01:48:15.633 --> 01:48:24.396]  I mean, the bigger news is that you pay a carpet cleaner, you pay somebody to be in your house, and they're there just spying on you.
[01:48:25.076 --> 01:48:27.697]  America, land of the cowards, home of the snitches.
[01:48:29.877 --> 01:48:31.558]  But again, they do it to women.
[01:48:32.618 --> 01:48:34.558]  All over the country, they show up.
[01:48:34.598 --> 01:48:36.199]  My wife doesn't, by the way, answer the door.
[01:48:37.059 --> 01:48:38.139]  Not that she put up with her bull.
[01:48:38.179 --> 01:48:39.780]  Now, did they demand her license?
[01:48:40.871 --> 01:48:41.251]  They did.
[01:48:41.271 --> 01:48:47.253]  At her house, you know, she should have never opened the door, and she should have called the police on them.
[01:48:47.873 --> 01:48:50.874]  Of course, then they might just claim she's resistant and put a couple slugs in her.
[01:48:51.414 --> 01:48:52.094]  I'm serious, folks.
[01:48:52.114 --> 01:48:53.055]  They grease people now.
[01:48:53.115 --> 01:48:54.935]  I mean, there's some of them that are hardcore killers.
[01:48:55.675 --> 01:49:00.697]  And you need to call the police department about that, and you need to demand to know what detail.
[01:49:00.717 --> 01:49:01.917]  Are you in the county or the city?
[01:49:02.857 --> 01:49:04.218]  I'm in the city in South Austin.
[01:49:04.578 --> 01:49:04.758]  Yeah.
[01:49:06.337 --> 01:49:09.719]  Yeah, it was... God, these people are pure wickedness.
[01:49:09.759 --> 01:49:11.520]  And they think they're good.
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:12.981]  That's what's so sick about it.
[01:49:13.921 --> 01:49:15.522]  And so they ran her license.
[01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:17.283]  We hear there's marijuana.
[01:49:18.704 --> 01:49:24.027]  I have to give praise to my wife, props to my wife, because she handled herself very well.
[01:49:24.087 --> 01:49:28.029]  She said, I do not feel comfortable with you guys coming in here with my husband not here.
[01:49:28.049 --> 01:49:32.591]  She did a good job, but you say, what are you guys doing trying to violate the Fourth Amendment?
[01:49:32.971 --> 01:49:34.092]  I need your names right now.
[01:49:36.528 --> 01:49:42.255]  And uh, it's good to have like a metal door, screen door in front of you so you don't, cause they'll, they'll, what they'll do is they'll assault you.
[01:49:42.936 --> 01:49:44.338]  And then they'll say you assaulted them.
[01:49:45.019 --> 01:49:48.423]  So metal doors are very, very important when you're dealing with these hardcore criminals.
[01:49:49.124 --> 01:49:50.205]  Alright my friend, good to hear from you.
[01:49:50.225 --> 01:49:51.347]  We'll come back and take more calls.
[01:49:56.025 --> 01:50:01.527]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.888 --> 01:50:09.531]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.225 --> 01:50:17.287]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:17.668 --> 01:50:29.131]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.411 --> 01:50:32.913]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:35.313]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:35.634 --> 01:50:39.495]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:50:40.075 --> 01:50:47.543]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:50:53.118 --> 01:50:56.300]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:50:56.340 --> 01:51:00.383]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:51:00.503 --> 01:51:03.064]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:51:03.124 --> 01:51:05.466]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:51:05.646 --> 01:51:14.091]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:51:14.151 --> 01:51:15.472]  The brookie light is different.
[01:51:15.612 --> 01:51:19.735]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:51:19.935 --> 01:51:20.696]  We're good to go!
[01:51:40.026 --> 01:51:43.068]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[01:51:43.088 --> 01:51:44.969]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:44.989 --> 01:51:46.170]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:52.839 --> 01:51:54.561]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:54.781 --> 01:51:58.505]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:58.805 --> 01:52:07.754]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:07.914 --> 01:52:12.819]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.019 --> 01:52:14.701]  Every time you walk away from your computer,
[01:52:14.741 --> 01:52:15.361]  We're good to go.
[01:52:31.087 --> 01:52:31.988]  This is the end
[01:53:02.235 --> 01:53:07.337]  I have a stack of news today of sheriffs, police chiefs caught running the narcotics in their town.
[01:53:08.397 --> 01:53:09.357]  I'm not even going to cover it.
[01:53:09.397 --> 01:53:10.318]  Everybody knows that.
[01:53:13.099 --> 01:53:15.680]  Most major police chiefs deal drugs.
[01:53:15.940 --> 01:53:16.260]  Most.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:20.002]  I'd say, you can't really put a number, I'd say 60% are drug dealers.
[01:53:20.982 --> 01:53:22.843]  Big city cops, they're on the take.
[01:53:23.463 --> 01:53:25.104]  But in a lot of your small towns, they're the dealers.
[01:53:25.144 --> 01:53:28.165]  And they will still put your children, though, in the local lockup.
[01:53:29.779 --> 01:53:32.041]  Well, all their deputies drive around in brand new Corvettes.
[01:53:32.141 --> 01:53:33.002]  I've had enough of it.
[01:53:33.462 --> 01:53:45.071]  Then you show up at a Christian family's home of a guy who broke his back years ago, and you've already beat him up once for being paralyzed, and then you want to know about drugs in his house.
[01:53:45.111 --> 01:53:46.112]  Just shut up!
[01:53:47.813 --> 01:53:50.295]  And I'm telling the young people, do not use their drugs.
[01:53:50.876 --> 01:53:54.238]  Stop using any illegal drugs, and don't use their prescription drugs either.
[01:53:54.278 --> 01:53:55.199]  It's all their products.
[01:53:55.579 --> 01:53:56.120]  Don't use it.
[01:53:58.487 --> 01:54:06.349]  It's just so rich, though, that they deal them, and then they... Oh, it's just unbelievable.
[01:54:07.529 --> 01:54:09.330]  We'd like to search your house.
[01:54:09.390 --> 01:54:12.251]  Why don't you let us in?
[01:54:12.791 --> 01:54:14.451]  Violating the Fourth Amendment!
[01:54:15.011 --> 01:54:16.012]  Through intimidation!
[01:54:16.032 --> 01:54:19.033]  Just like Lawson Cops said, you're not allowed to demonstrate in Austin anymore.
[01:54:19.053 --> 01:54:20.193]  We're gonna arrest you if you don't leave.
[01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:21.513]  Well, go ahead and arrest me!
[01:54:21.993 --> 01:54:24.154]  See, they were engaging in a crime right there, folks.
[01:54:27.196 --> 01:54:27.977]  Several crimes.
[01:54:28.057 --> 01:54:29.178]  I can go over them if you'd like.
[01:54:29.218 --> 01:54:30.099]  But see, they think it's normal.
[01:54:30.119 --> 01:54:31.560]  Well, we're allowed to commit crimes.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:32.821]  We're allowed to lie on the stand.
[01:54:32.841 --> 01:54:36.965]  And we're... You know, your bosses are allowed to take your pension funds, too.
[01:54:37.005 --> 01:54:37.445]  And they will.
[01:54:37.506 --> 01:54:37.946]  Don't worry.
[01:54:38.266 --> 01:54:40.128]  And when you're whining about the system, just remember it.
[01:54:44.052 --> 01:54:47.675]  Folks, bad nutrition is a breeding ground for illness due to stress and anxiety.
[01:54:48.556 --> 01:55:03.371]  And I'm telling you, you need to get a major boost, and that's with InterFood, the best green food out there with all these great kelp and barley leaf and rose hemps and all these key vitamins and nutrients and minerals.
[01:55:03.431 --> 01:55:05.814]  It's great stuff, and I take it every day.
[01:55:05.834 --> 01:55:07.476]  E-N-E-R-Food.com.
[01:55:07.496 --> 01:55:08.417]  Remember our sponsors.
[01:55:08.937 --> 01:55:10.319]  E-N-E-R-Food.com.
[01:55:11.209 --> 01:55:11.990]  Or 1-866-762-9238.
[01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:15.852]  Call them.
[01:55:15.972 --> 01:55:19.995]  Get an introductory order of Interfood.
[01:55:20.035 --> 01:55:20.655]  Try it out.
[01:55:20.915 --> 01:55:23.257]  Because the food has been debased of its value.
[01:55:24.117 --> 01:55:25.518]  And that's why you're always hungry, hungry, hungry.
[01:55:25.538 --> 01:55:29.821]  You've got to eat, eat, eat to get the nutrients you need out of more food and junk calories.
[01:55:29.841 --> 01:55:31.161]  866-762-9238 or ENERFOOD.COM
[01:55:37.944 --> 01:55:39.906]  I want to tell you about another great sponsor we have.
[01:55:40.807 --> 01:55:42.028]  They will use food as a weapon.
[01:55:42.048 --> 01:55:42.529]  The U.N.
[01:55:42.569 --> 01:55:43.029]  has said it.
[01:55:43.410 --> 01:55:44.351]  The Pentagon has said it.
[01:55:44.371 --> 01:55:46.293]  Just type into Google, food as a weapon.
[01:55:46.313 --> 01:55:51.819]  You'll get all these Pentagon plans to use food as a weapon against the American people and how they use it overseas.
[01:55:52.299 --> 01:55:55.482]  You've got a couple years of storable food you're willing to hold up in your house.
[01:55:55.543 --> 01:55:59.607]  No matter how bad martial law is, enough of us do it, they won't be able to take us down.
[01:56:01.087 --> 01:56:02.508]  And so it's very inexpensive.
[01:56:02.548 --> 01:56:03.308]  It's high quality.
[01:56:03.328 --> 01:56:04.708]  It's the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:56:04.748 --> 01:56:08.650]  Give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[01:56:08.670 --> 01:56:08.810]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:56:08.910 --> 01:56:13.691]  Don't end up like folks in New Orleans having to go to the Superdome.
[01:56:14.052 --> 01:56:19.333]  Also, with wildfires, hurricanes, natural disasters, it's good to have high quality, storable foods that last 10 years.
[01:56:19.353 --> 01:56:19.554]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:56:19.834 --> 01:56:20.214]  Or eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:56:20.234 --> 01:56:20.974]  That's eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:56:21.014 --> 01:56:21.914]  We have a big fat banner on the
[01:56:30.600 --> 01:56:35.883]  Right-hand side of PrisonPlanet.com to all of the sponsors, so be sure and check out eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:56:36.783 --> 01:56:39.584]  I have been so busy today, I've spent about 30 seconds plugging my films.
[01:56:41.205 --> 01:56:49.109]  And I got so many calls, I got five audio clips I want to play, tons of news, I can never get to it all, and I end up just cutting out and plugging my videos.
[01:56:51.130 --> 01:56:56.032]  And I shouldn't be doing that because it's one of the biggest parts of the solution in this fight against the New World Order.
[01:56:56.880 --> 01:57:08.326]  Go check out the online video and bookstore Infowars.com, order the new edition of Terror Storm, or order America, Freedom to Fascism, or Riddle in Stone, or any of the great books and videos we carry about other great researchers.
[01:57:09.086 --> 01:57:12.608]  Infowars.com, or call toll free and they can take your order.
[01:57:12.628 --> 01:57:13.128]  888-253-3139.
[01:57:13.148 --> 01:57:15.169]  Or get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, only 15 cents a day.
[01:57:22.310 --> 01:57:24.932]  Fifteen cents a day, all my films, TV shows, everything.
[01:57:25.432 --> 01:57:26.413]  Great activist tool.
[01:57:26.473 --> 01:57:28.014]  Burn them to death, give them to people.
[01:57:28.514 --> 01:57:31.016]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with a third hour.
[01:57:31.036 --> 01:57:36.760]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.081 --> 01:57:37.881]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.162 --> 01:57:53.345]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.026 --> 01:57:54.827]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.567 --> 01:57:56.488]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.508 --> 01:58:00.771]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.332 --> 01:58:05.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:05.655 --> 01:58:10.339]  Okay, I'm going to try to blast through ten more calls.
[01:58:10.359 --> 01:58:10.940]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:12.621 --> 01:58:17.405]  Then I have five audio clips, probably fifteen incredible top news stories I haven't gotten to.
[01:58:19.890 --> 01:58:21.452]  Who's up first here at all these calls?
[01:58:23.313 --> 01:58:26.136]  John in California, then Jacob, Michael, Lucas, and others.
[01:58:26.176 --> 01:58:27.357]  Go ahead, John, you're on the air.
[01:58:27.877 --> 01:58:28.958]  Hey, Alex, great job.
[01:58:29.359 --> 01:58:36.946]  Listen, I just wanted to make a couple quick comments and then a question in regards to that Ed Fehler guy who called in, that Will guy.
[01:58:37.406 --> 01:58:45.073]  You know, they don't even mention, they keep on trying to gloss over the lie that Thompson wasn't even a declared candidate before, and they invited him to talk.
[01:58:45.859 --> 01:58:47.641]  No, just another member of the NWO.
[01:58:48.081 --> 01:58:55.227]  I can't believe somebody called in defending the exclusion of Ron Paul from the debate and claiming that we're making it up that he's been excluded.
[01:58:55.407 --> 01:58:57.329]  That's like saying amnesty doesn't exist.
[01:58:57.729 --> 01:58:59.050]  I mean, it's just their tactic.
[01:58:59.150 --> 01:59:00.131]  Oh, we're not doing that.
[01:59:00.251 --> 01:59:00.651]  That's right.
[01:59:00.671 --> 01:59:01.772]  Deny, deny, deny.
[01:59:01.792 --> 01:59:03.374]  You know, that's what a thug will do.
[01:59:03.434 --> 01:59:08.058]  They'll deny until the second they're behind bars, and then once they're out from behind bars, they'll deny it again.
[01:59:10.058 --> 01:59:16.362]  One thing, though, you might be a little bit mistaken on with that public officer that was threatening you and violating a public trust by doing so.
[01:59:16.542 --> 01:59:17.582]  You need to expose him.
[01:59:18.163 --> 01:59:18.663]  You really do.
[01:59:18.683 --> 01:59:21.304]  You need to expose his name, his public badge number.
[01:59:21.925 --> 01:59:30.389]  That's the only thing that's going to keep him from doing it in the future, and that's the only thing that's going to allow people to keep track of him as he tries to become a politico later in life.
[01:59:31.293 --> 01:59:32.494]  You know, you're probably right.
[01:59:32.834 --> 01:59:38.676]  I just have gotten to the point where I've realized that we can actually, especially locally in Austin, we can crush people.
[01:59:39.336 --> 01:59:41.337]  And I don't take pleasure in crushing people.
[01:59:41.897 --> 01:59:43.958]  And I've analyzed the guy.
[01:59:43.998 --> 01:59:44.758]  He is a liar.
[01:59:44.798 --> 01:59:46.599]  Yeah, it's not an issue of crushing people.
[01:59:46.639 --> 01:59:47.339]  I mean, they're adults.
[01:59:47.499 --> 01:59:50.560]  They've already... But if I attack him, it will... Who knows?
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:51.781]  They may actually promote him, though.
[01:59:51.801 --> 01:59:54.842]  We've actually... Either it crushes them or they promote them for being able...
[01:59:56.392 --> 02:00:00.537]  Listen, I want to make a comment and I want you to comment on it.
[02:00:00.657 --> 02:00:06.285]  You know, we've kind of lost six years remonstrating with power and the only thing they ever respect is direct action back.
[02:00:08.374 --> 02:00:16.003]  I'm just wondering, I mean, you keep on talking about these sub-orders from the New World Order and not really talking about the big powers behind it.
[02:00:16.403 --> 02:00:20.547]  You're pretty well-read, so I'm pretty sure you've read the stuff by Avro Manhattan.
[02:00:20.608 --> 02:00:23.731]  I mean, do you put any credence behind that information?
[02:00:23.771 --> 02:00:28.276]  It seems that a lot of people in the States are being attacked, or Protestant, or Protestant Christians.
[02:00:29.551 --> 02:00:33.693]  Well, I mean, you see Tony Blair becoming a Catholic so he can later be EU chief.
[02:00:34.433 --> 02:00:37.574]  And I mean, there's no debate that the Catholic Church is evil now.
[02:00:38.435 --> 02:00:40.456]  Then people want to debate how long it's been evil.
[02:00:40.516 --> 02:00:42.056]  I mean, the point is, it doesn't matter.
[02:00:42.477 --> 02:00:44.878]  We know that the Pope's calling for one world government.
[02:00:45.178 --> 02:00:46.598]  The last Pope called for it.
[02:00:47.339 --> 02:00:51.520]  And we know that definitely the Vatican's part of the world power structure.
[02:00:52.221 --> 02:00:52.621]  I just
[02:00:53.667 --> 02:00:56.109]  Everybody obsesses over whether who's the most powerful.
[02:00:56.129 --> 02:00:57.811]  The Vatican, Israel, the British.
[02:00:58.211 --> 02:00:59.612]  It's all the same club, man.
[02:01:00.253 --> 02:01:02.915]  And so, I mean, that's what I've found.
[02:01:03.456 --> 02:01:10.502]  And so, I think the Patriot Movement spends about half its energy debating who the most powerful people in the New World Order are.
[02:01:11.691 --> 02:01:13.853]  And, I mean, we're here exposing them.
[02:01:13.893 --> 02:01:20.297]  We don't pull punches on Ratzinger, or on Rothschild, or Rockefeller, or Queen Beatrix, or any of these people.
[02:01:20.757 --> 02:01:21.797]  They're all on the same team.
[02:01:21.817 --> 02:01:23.458]  They've combined forces against the people.
[02:01:24.019 --> 02:01:28.221]  And then you see Protestant leaders calling for amnesty, and saying, worship Israel.
[02:01:28.261 --> 02:01:29.902]  I mean, it's all pretty much the same crew.
[02:01:30.583 --> 02:01:33.785]  And so, I just don't think that it, a lot of people have their heritage.
[02:01:34.548 --> 02:01:39.774]  And so I'm not going to just sit here and attack people's heritage when it does nothing politically in this fight.
[02:01:40.195 --> 02:01:51.168]  I'm just trying to go, hey, we don't want a North American Union, we don't want gun control, and plus a lot of the Jew-bashers, it's a religion, I know that's New World Order control, the extreme branch of that.
[02:01:52.409 --> 02:02:03.372]  Uh, just as much as the Jewish groups are, the Zionist groups, uh, and I know that also some of the folks that say everything's a Catholic conspiracy have lied about me and said a lot of things about me that aren't true.
[02:02:03.752 --> 02:02:06.832]  Some of the big leaders of the, you know, the Catholics run everything movement.
[02:02:07.213 --> 02:02:12.254]  And so that kind of scares you away from something if the leaders of it are a pack of liars.
[02:02:13.294 --> 02:02:14.874]  Uh, I mean, they just make stuff up, man.
[02:02:15.534 --> 02:02:17.795]  And so, uh, I mean, with me, there's nothing hidden.
[02:02:18.610 --> 02:02:20.531]  With me, what you get is what you got.
[02:02:20.611 --> 02:02:23.452]  I mean, Alex Jones doesn't pull punches.
[02:02:24.032 --> 02:02:24.612]  I'm right here.
[02:02:25.552 --> 02:02:28.974]  And so, it becomes a non-issue.
[02:02:29.574 --> 02:02:32.895]  The Catholic Church is a giant branch of the New World Order.
[02:02:33.575 --> 02:02:35.776]  There is no debating it.
[02:02:35.836 --> 02:02:37.296]  I mean, no Catholic will deny that.
[02:02:37.336 --> 02:02:41.238]  They know that the Pope said all the religions are the same and called for one world government.
[02:02:41.578 --> 02:02:42.578]  Doesn't get any worse than that.
[02:02:47.845 --> 02:02:53.332]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:53.693 --> 02:03:01.323]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.020 --> 02:03:09.063]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:09.463 --> 02:03:20.888]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.208 --> 02:03:24.690]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.170 --> 02:03:27.111]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:27.431 --> 02:03:31.273]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:41.531 --> 02:04:46.313]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[02:04:46.333 --> 02:04:48.694]  I'm seeing Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[02:04:48.834 --> 02:04:51.795]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[02:04:51.875 --> 02:04:52.555]  is a real thing.
[02:04:52.615 --> 02:04:59.478]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh and never before available garlic.
[02:04:59.638 --> 02:05:04.900]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[02:05:05.060 --> 02:05:05.821]  We're good to go!
[02:05:31.883 --> 02:05:35.565]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[02:05:35.605 --> 02:05:40.689]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[02:05:40.829 --> 02:05:43.610]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[02:05:46.152 --> 02:05:52.156]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:52.776 --> 02:05:55.758]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.285 --> 02:06:02.287]  ...of MIT engineer Jeff King talking about the controlled demolition of the towers.
[02:06:02.607 --> 02:06:16.714]  There are now literally close to 400, I know it was close to 400 a few months ago when I counted it up, engineers with engineering, structural engineering, electrical engineering, you know, all sorts of engineering degrees,
[02:06:17.603 --> 02:06:20.964]  Not just physicists and others saying it's a total control demolition.
[02:06:21.404 --> 02:06:23.085]  The video is up on prisonplanet.com.
[02:06:23.125 --> 02:06:24.585]  We're going to play the audio of it.
[02:06:25.226 --> 02:06:28.587]  Also, I'm not going to play the Ron Paul on the technology show.
[02:06:28.647 --> 02:06:29.507]  It's eight minutes long.
[02:06:29.887 --> 02:06:32.688]  He's defending net neutrality, defending internet freedom.
[02:06:33.208 --> 02:06:34.829]  The caller who saw that was confused.
[02:06:34.849 --> 02:06:36.829]  It's like Ron Paul two years ago.
[02:06:36.910 --> 02:06:40.991]  The NRA member gave him a bad mark for Second Amendment because he wouldn't go
[02:06:42.705 --> 02:06:47.769]  For a handgun liability protection bill because it had gun registration in it.
[02:06:50.251 --> 02:06:57.517]  So they added gun control onto it as riders, so he said no, then the NRA came in and said he's anti-gun and gave him a bad mark.
[02:06:59.379 --> 02:07:05.884]  When we were trying to beat a bunch of gun laws in Texas in 2000 folks, the NRA came out and lobbied against us.
[02:07:06.004 --> 02:07:07.465]  I was there with the NRA lobbyist.
[02:07:08.386 --> 02:07:09.687]  Okay, I've watched it happen.
[02:07:10.484 --> 02:07:12.405]  They helped pass the 68 Gun Control Act.
[02:07:12.705 --> 02:07:26.172]  They helped pass the thing two weeks ago, which federalizes everything, and then now if you've ever had any type of mental problem, even if it was something where they told you, you'll get better tuition if you sign up for this, or you'll get, you know, they got all these hundreds of new designations.
[02:07:26.212 --> 02:07:26.713]  No guns!
[02:07:28.994 --> 02:07:31.956]  Incredible funding to now integrate all the databases.
[02:07:32.076 --> 02:07:32.856]  Horrible news!
[02:07:34.997 --> 02:07:36.678]  One step closer to gun confiscation.
[02:07:36.758 --> 02:07:38.339]  Bigger than the 68 Gun Control Act.
[02:07:39.033 --> 02:07:40.434]  And Ron Paul voted against that too.
[02:07:40.494 --> 02:07:42.996]  So see, they also play games with things.
[02:07:43.757 --> 02:07:45.298]  And that's basically what the reporter does.
[02:07:45.338 --> 02:07:50.022]  Yeah, Ron Paul's voted against things that are called net neutrality bills.
[02:07:50.623 --> 02:07:51.443]  But they're not that.
[02:07:52.044 --> 02:07:54.126]  It's like Bush saying this isn't amnesty, but it is.
[02:07:55.487 --> 02:07:56.568]  I have studied his votes.
[02:07:57.048 --> 02:07:58.810]  The John Birch Society studied his votes.
[02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:00.651]  Anybody can study his votes.
[02:08:00.691 --> 02:08:02.012]  He's got a perfect voting record.
[02:08:02.413 --> 02:08:02.853]  Perfect.
[02:08:04.414 --> 02:08:07.517]  It's perfect if you're a constitutionalist or libertarian.
[02:08:08.081 --> 02:08:08.961]  A paleoconservative.
[02:08:10.082 --> 02:08:11.983]  And so there's a lot of games being played.
[02:08:12.003 --> 02:08:12.823]  I don't have time to play.
[02:08:12.843 --> 02:08:14.564]  Go to Ron Paul's own website if you want to watch it.
[02:08:15.905 --> 02:08:17.546]  Caller called about it earlier and I said I'd play it.
[02:08:17.586 --> 02:08:18.366]  We just don't have time.
[02:08:18.806 --> 02:08:20.427]  Let's go ahead.
[02:08:21.407 --> 02:08:22.008]  Who's up next?
[02:08:23.088 --> 02:08:23.929]  I'm going to move quick here.
[02:08:23.969 --> 02:08:24.789]  Jacob in Nevada.
[02:08:24.809 --> 02:08:25.129]  Go ahead.
[02:08:25.149 --> 02:08:26.910]  Hey Alex.
[02:08:27.010 --> 02:08:29.671]  Thanks for taking my call and thanks for waking everybody up.
[02:08:29.851 --> 02:08:30.052]  Sure.
[02:08:30.092 --> 02:08:30.372]  Welcome.
[02:08:30.392 --> 02:08:30.912]  What's on your mind?
[02:08:31.502 --> 02:08:37.024]  Well, I'd like to talk about a book that's on the Ron Paul reading list too, Traitor Giuliani.
[02:08:37.444 --> 02:08:47.889]  It's called Imperially Hubris by Michael Schur, who was... Yeah, that's the CIA guy that kind of puts out the whitewash that we cause terrorism, you know?
[02:08:48.409 --> 02:08:48.969]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:08:49.669 --> 02:08:52.090]  Basically, that book has three main points.
[02:08:52.771 --> 02:08:53.931]  One of them being the U.S.
[02:08:53.991 --> 02:08:55.892]  influence in the Middle East, support of Israel,
[02:08:56.676 --> 02:08:59.898]  Is basically the cause of all the terrorist attacks and stuff like that.
[02:08:59.918 --> 02:09:06.322]  Well, it stimulates all the real asymmetrical military attacks that we're under, yes, that are called terrorism.
[02:09:07.342 --> 02:09:17.248]  Yeah, the other two things are he pretty much trashes the administration and the high-level CIA for handling Afghanistan and Iraq.
[02:09:17.868 --> 02:09:23.692]  And then he also basically paints Bin Laden as like a mythical figure in Islam.
[02:09:24.582 --> 02:09:26.844]  Talks about, you know, huge internet following and all this stuff.
[02:09:26.984 --> 02:09:29.365]  I was just kind of curious what your take is.
[02:09:29.385 --> 02:09:30.266]  I've read the book and it's 98% bull.
[02:09:30.306 --> 02:09:30.886]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:30.906 --> 02:09:31.767]  What is Ron Paul doing there?
[02:09:38.544 --> 02:09:42.586]  It's one of the few things you can actually criticize him on, but I understand why he's doing it.
[02:09:42.947 --> 02:09:44.467]  He's playing their game, okay?
[02:09:44.487 --> 02:09:52.192]  And I'm not going to get into what I've talked about with Ron Paul privately or when he on air has said clearly our government stages terror events and has staged them and may stage them.
[02:09:52.392 --> 02:09:54.573]  We've got articles up with the text and the audio.
[02:09:55.774 --> 02:09:56.775]  So Ron Paul knows.
[02:09:56.795 --> 02:10:00.136]  You heard his campaign manager yesterday say, the stuff you talk about's true.
[02:10:00.637 --> 02:10:01.617]  There is a conspiracy.
[02:10:03.138 --> 02:10:04.979]  So Ron Paul's on board, okay?
[02:10:05.339 --> 02:10:06.200]  He knows what's going on.
[02:10:07.188 --> 02:10:18.118]  But when he knows that when Giuliani attacks him on being soft on terror, that he can point towards, not the 9-11 attack so much, as what he's saying is true is, P-2-O-G, the Pentagon, wants this.
[02:10:18.318 --> 02:10:33.572]  They admit, the whole office of P-2-O-G, 6.2 billion funding a year, goes out and kills, it says, innocent family members of Muslims to make Arab men join resistance groups to widen conflicts for destabilization of the Middle East and Central Asia.
[02:10:35.028 --> 02:10:38.890]  The defense contractors have got to have an excuse to move forces in there and sell weapon systems.
[02:10:39.971 --> 02:10:44.614]  And they found Arabs, or firecrackers, and are ready to go get in a fight.
[02:10:46.175 --> 02:10:47.555]  They got a lot of heart, folks.
[02:10:47.775 --> 02:10:50.137]  They may not be the best until they get trained.
[02:10:50.917 --> 02:10:51.357]  Can't blame them.
[02:10:51.377 --> 02:10:53.038]  They weren't brought up, a lot of them weren't brought up with guns.
[02:10:53.078 --> 02:10:57.181]  I get off of the old joke in the Army of, thank God they can't aim a rifle.
[02:10:57.201 --> 02:10:59.262]  But they're learning how to aim rifles now.
[02:11:00.478 --> 02:11:09.442]  And so they just go over there and stir up the hornet's nest to feed some more of our young men in too, so they can come back and learn how to run checkpoints and arrest families, so they can come back here and do that.
[02:11:09.462 --> 02:11:11.603]  And that's really what it's all about.
[02:11:13.964 --> 02:11:21.308]  And so, yes, it's true that the invasion and the occupation is stimulating military resistance, which is called terrorism.
[02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:27.991]  And so that part of what the CIA writer, the expert on Bin Laden, says is true.
[02:11:28.769 --> 02:11:30.250]  And when Ron Paul says that, it's true.
[02:11:30.750 --> 02:11:39.633]  But the rest of the book generally, which I sped read, stuff like that I just scanned through, it's not worth the paper it's written on.
[02:11:40.294 --> 02:11:43.395]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:11:44.515 --> 02:11:45.836]  Let's talk to Peter in Canada.
[02:11:45.856 --> 02:11:46.436]  You're on the air.
[02:11:48.017 --> 02:11:48.177]  Alex.
[02:11:48.517 --> 02:11:48.757]  Hi.
[02:11:49.237 --> 02:11:49.698]  Hi.
[02:11:49.738 --> 02:11:51.058]  Two quick things.
[02:11:51.698 --> 02:11:57.781]  You've mentioned in the past before how in Arkansas, back when Clinton was governor,
[02:11:58.550 --> 02:12:06.802]  Uh, there was a body that was actually recovered from the landfill that had all the limbs and its head completely decapitated and it was ruled a suicide.
[02:12:07.683 --> 02:12:10.528]  Yeah, I think that was one of the private detectives on Clinton.
[02:12:10.548 --> 02:12:11.389]  I forget all the names.
[02:12:11.469 --> 02:12:13.211]  It's in, there's three videos.
[02:12:13.231 --> 02:12:14.694]  There's the Clinton Chronicles,
[02:12:15.387 --> 02:12:16.007]  Clinton Chronicles 2.
[02:12:16.107 --> 02:12:17.307]  Then there's one other.
[02:12:17.348 --> 02:12:17.988]  I can't remember the name.
[02:12:18.008 --> 02:12:24.469]  This is like stuff I was putting on local access TV in the mid-1990s.
[02:12:25.950 --> 02:12:28.890]  But yeah, I've interviewed former Arkansas State Police.
[02:12:28.930 --> 02:12:30.751]  I've interviewed locals.
[02:12:30.931 --> 02:12:32.431]  I've interviewed the guy that got tortured.
[02:12:32.451 --> 02:12:33.451]  I forget his name too.
[02:12:33.491 --> 02:12:36.092]  The two state police came over and tortured him almost to death.
[02:12:36.112 --> 02:12:36.992]  He's now in a wheelchair.
[02:12:37.012 --> 02:12:40.873]  Remember he videotaped Jennifer Flowers, her apartment when Clinton went in.
[02:12:45.054 --> 02:12:57.183]  There were several bodies that had the arms and legs cut off, but in one case they cut arms, legs, head off, put them in a plastic bag, poured gasoline on them in a landfill, I forget who that was, and then... That was like Houdini.
[02:12:58.104 --> 02:13:01.287]  Yeah, and I mean, you'd have to go watch those videos and pull that out.
[02:13:01.587 --> 02:13:08.472]  When stuff starts getting that old sometimes, my memory's not what it used to be, but somebody can probably call in and get in and tell us some of those names.
[02:13:08.532 --> 02:13:09.633]  It wasn't just one person.
[02:13:10.758 --> 02:13:17.783]  Uh, they ruled it suicide, uh, with the kids on the tracks that had been stabbed and tortured and had been cut up, too.
[02:13:17.883 --> 02:13:19.284]  So, I mean, they just do it over and over again.
[02:13:19.304 --> 02:13:25.028]  Yeah, I take it that ruling was, uh, uh, compliments of Fannie... Fannie Malick.
[02:13:25.188 --> 02:13:29.371]  Fannie Malick, uh, who was the local examiner there in Mena with all the murders.
[02:13:30.092 --> 02:13:32.814]  But there were other cases where they'd, like, shoot up a car and there'd be,
[02:13:34.008 --> 02:13:36.530]  I forget, it was something like a hundred bullet holes or something.
[02:13:36.930 --> 02:13:44.797]  You know, all over the car, they just machined down the hole, you know, and the local cop, or another local cop, they poisoned him with anthrax, weaponized anthrax.
[02:13:46.438 --> 02:13:47.719]  I mean, that was in the news.
[02:13:47.759 --> 02:13:48.700]  We have the newscast.
[02:13:49.580 --> 02:13:52.523]  It's ridiculous.
[02:13:52.843 --> 02:13:54.044]  Oh, quickly, the other thing.
[02:13:54.684 --> 02:14:01.470]  You know how you've mentioned that when you've gone out to Hollywood and you've talked to some heavies out there and they know about New World Order and 9-11?
[02:14:02.441 --> 02:14:05.161]  But for obvious reasons, they're afraid to go public.
[02:14:05.922 --> 02:14:15.223]  What are the chances of getting some of these people to, at the very least, say, give Ron Paul's campaign a little, you know, much-needed exposure?
[02:14:15.383 --> 02:14:16.524]  Yeah, it'd be nice if they did.
[02:14:16.564 --> 02:14:17.604]  I appreciate your call.
[02:14:17.684 --> 02:14:20.184]  I mean, I don't even know if Ron Paul wants Hollywood People's endorsement.
[02:14:20.484 --> 02:14:21.364]  I don't think he cares.
[02:14:21.384 --> 02:14:26.205]  I mean, the only reason Hollywood endorsements are good is because it gets a lot of attention to a subject.
[02:14:27.265 --> 02:14:28.786]  People say, well, what does their opinion matter?
[02:14:28.846 --> 02:14:30.206]  Well, they're their citizen, too.
[02:14:31.189 --> 02:14:31.669]  How you doing Alex?
[02:14:31.689 --> 02:14:32.109]  Hey man.
[02:14:32.149 --> 02:14:33.470]  First, a comment and question.
[02:14:33.490 --> 02:14:34.770]  I saw one of your old broadcasts.
[02:14:56.658 --> 02:15:05.366]  With you at the anti-gun control rally, I think it was in Austin, where they're chanting, uh, no more, no more, Hitler was for gun control!
[02:15:05.786 --> 02:15:07.128]  I thought that was hilarious.
[02:15:07.268 --> 02:15:08.549]  Yeah, no, I led the march.
[02:15:08.589 --> 02:15:09.830]  I got in front of their march.
[02:15:10.731 --> 02:15:15.355]  And, uh, and, uh, led their march saying, here come the Nazis for gun control.
[02:15:15.956 --> 02:15:18.658]  Needless to say, they didn't have another anti-gun march after that.
[02:15:19.239 --> 02:15:22.442]  I went to every million mom, every one of their little marches and ruined them.
[02:15:24.863 --> 02:15:28.325]  These old women trying to ram us with a car, and the police arrested them.
[02:15:28.385 --> 02:15:30.987]  It's... Funny.
[02:15:31.368 --> 02:15:36.291]  But I was wondering, what exactly happened between you and Greg Sispinski?
[02:15:36.311 --> 02:15:43.057]  Because I know they exaggerate a lot of the Vatican involvement, but a lot of stuff that they say is true, so I thought it was weird.
[02:15:43.097 --> 02:15:44.698]  I don't listen to him or watch him.
[02:15:44.738 --> 02:15:45.999]  I literally don't pay attention.
[02:15:46.519 --> 02:15:46.839]  I don't know.
[02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:48.521]  Somebody called me and said he was bashing me.
[02:15:48.621 --> 02:15:51.783]  I really don't even care, sir, and I appreciate your call.
[02:15:52.444 --> 02:15:52.684]  Listen.
[02:15:54.045 --> 02:16:01.571]  I think every day when I go to bed about how blessed my life's been and how wonderful my wife and family are and just how much I love God.
[02:16:03.012 --> 02:16:09.297]  And my idea of living high on the hog was eating some cheese enchiladas with beef tips on it about five minutes ago.
[02:16:11.719 --> 02:16:14.781]  And so I'm not in this to be a big shot or a bigwig.
[02:16:14.861 --> 02:16:18.404]  I need to stay big to stay alive right now, but that's basically it.
[02:16:19.064 --> 02:16:19.945]  A lot of other people
[02:16:22.370 --> 02:16:27.475]  Just spend their entire lives attacking me, because they hate my name being brought up to them every day.
[02:16:27.515 --> 02:16:29.176]  They hate hearing my name constantly.
[02:16:29.697 --> 02:16:32.859]  They hate... I mean, they ought to be glad I'm waking up a lot of people with your help.
[02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:41.127]  And I've been trailblazing this thing, and I've been, by sheer force of will, and the energy God gives me, beating my brains out.
[02:16:41.187 --> 02:16:43.689]  I mean, folks, I got home at 3 o'clock in the morning last night.
[02:16:44.670 --> 02:16:46.351]  I mean, I work savagely.
[02:16:47.512 --> 02:16:50.255]  And I try to talk about that to be an example to you.
[02:16:50.956 --> 02:16:53.797]  I mean, I savagely fight the info war, okay?
[02:16:53.817 --> 02:16:55.317]  And I can do it a lot smarter than I'm trying to.
[02:16:56.997 --> 02:16:59.078]  And I just... I've learned to be fearless.
[02:17:00.198 --> 02:17:05.919]  And that's why people have rallied to what we're doing, and now we have encouraged... I'm very proud of it.
[02:17:05.939 --> 02:17:07.019]  I'm not a prideful person.
[02:17:07.059 --> 02:17:12.281]  I'm very proud of all the people we've woken up and all the people we've gotten to become activists and leaders.
[02:17:13.501 --> 02:17:18.842]  It's sad to me a lot of times to see some of them turn against me later, but that's like a father having his son turn against him.
[02:17:19.634 --> 02:17:22.635]  You know, when the kid's 15 years old, they come back later and apologize.
[02:17:22.675 --> 02:17:24.955]  It's okay.
[02:17:26.936 --> 02:17:34.477]  So, again, this movement hasn't been as successful as it could because they can't help themselves.
[02:17:34.497 --> 02:17:39.398]  They're in it for the wrong reasons and all they do is sit on the telephone attacking other members of the Patriot community.
[02:17:39.959 --> 02:17:40.779]  We don't do that.
[02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:41.819]  Okay?
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:54.868]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:17:55.128 --> 02:18:06.358]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:18:06.699 --> 02:18:11.763]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[02:18:11.783 --> 02:18:12.403]  Sure, no problem.
[02:18:12.643 --> 02:18:19.305]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:18:19.505 --> 02:18:26.327]  Black Berkey elements flow 1.5 to 2 times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:26.587 --> 02:18:28.367]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:18:28.627 --> 02:18:30.688]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements
[02:18:30.748 --> 02:18:32.390]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:33.291]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.311 --> 02:18:33.672]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.692 --> 02:18:35.074]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:18:47.737 --> 02:18:51.421]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:51.821 --> 02:18:57.246]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:57.706 --> 02:18:58.787]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:18:58.827 --> 02:19:02.871]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:03.511 --> 02:19:16.844]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:16.864 --> 02:19:22.649]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:22.949 --> 02:19:28.835]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:19:29.576 --> 02:19:30.917]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.057 --> 02:19:35.603]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[02:19:36.044 --> 02:19:36.645]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.705 --> 02:19:38.848]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[02:19:38.868 --> 02:19:38.928]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:47.802 --> 02:19:50.883]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.
[02:19:51.083 --> 02:19:53.825]  We are now offering a critically important $10 package.
[02:19:53.985 --> 02:20:06.550]  The package contains 3 DVDs with 10 different programs, our new 658-page book called The Truth About What Really Happened to the Catholic Church After Vatican II, which is the most comprehensive book ever produced on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[02:20:07.250 --> 02:20:07.611]  I think so.
[02:20:29.352 --> 02:20:34.697]  Well, you can mail in your order to us at Most Holy Family Monastery, 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York, 14735.
[02:20:35.538 --> 02:20:39.442]  The price of the whole package is $10, which includes media mail shipping.
[02:20:39.462 --> 02:20:43.085]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[02:20:43.366 --> 02:20:45.508]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com
[02:20:46.943 --> 02:20:49.684]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[02:20:50.124 --> 02:20:52.405]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[02:20:52.705 --> 02:20:55.786]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[02:20:56.266 --> 02:20:58.426]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[02:20:58.586 --> 02:20:59.967]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[02:21:00.227 --> 02:21:04.348]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[02:21:04.688 --> 02:21:07.809]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[02:21:08.089 --> 02:21:09.330]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[02:21:10.570 --> 02:21:18.837]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[02:21:19.198 --> 02:21:21.900]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[02:21:22.260 --> 02:21:29.567]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[02:21:29.927 --> 02:21:31.609]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now!
[02:22:15.129 --> 02:22:17.710]  We're good to go.
[02:22:42.009 --> 02:22:43.390]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:43.410 --> 02:22:44.111]  All right.
[02:22:44.952 --> 02:22:46.213]  I gotta start getting into these clips.
[02:22:46.233 --> 02:22:58.843]  Now, I could talk for hours about this, but basically Cavuto gets Ron Paul on and talking about the Brown family in New Hampshire, and he keeps saying, well, how will we run the country?
[02:22:59.043 --> 02:23:00.284]  You're not for any taxes.
[02:23:01.325 --> 02:23:04.108]  And Ron Paul says, we didn't have the income tax until 1913.
[02:23:04.148 --> 02:23:08.311]  And by the way, they didn't start really using it and charging it until
[02:23:09.739 --> 02:23:11.119]  During World War II and then after.
[02:23:11.139 --> 02:23:12.640]  It was only about 2% until then.
[02:23:13.460 --> 02:23:15.120]  Ron Paul's like, how do we build this capital?
[02:23:15.300 --> 02:23:16.140]  How do we do any of this?
[02:23:18.001 --> 02:23:18.761]  This is a fact.
[02:23:18.801 --> 02:23:19.941]  This isn't a wives tale.
[02:23:19.961 --> 02:23:21.421]  You can put this in your pipe and smoke it.
[02:23:22.002 --> 02:23:23.122]  You can go research this.
[02:23:24.222 --> 02:23:28.343]  The income tax goes to pay the debt to the private banks that own the country.
[02:23:29.003 --> 02:23:30.043]  Why do we pay the banks?
[02:23:30.103 --> 02:23:34.804]  Because they bought off the government and had the government hand over the power to issue money and credit to them.
[02:23:34.824 --> 02:23:38.805]  It'd be like if I showed up and paid off the mayor of Austin
[02:23:39.617 --> 02:23:40.798]  To make me the king of Austin.
[02:23:40.818 --> 02:23:43.139]  He couldn't legally do it, but if the people bought into it, he could.
[02:23:43.459 --> 02:23:45.020]  And then I just claimed I owned everything.
[02:23:46.760 --> 02:23:50.062]  The income tax is paid to foreign banks, predominantly.
[02:23:51.022 --> 02:23:52.123]  It doesn't run anything.
[02:23:52.163 --> 02:23:54.144]  Ronald Reagan's own commission showed that in 81.
[02:23:54.184 --> 02:23:54.364]  Okay?
[02:23:57.191 --> 02:23:58.192]  It doesn't run anything.
[02:23:58.212 --> 02:23:59.713]  There are hundreds of other taxes.
[02:24:00.014 --> 02:24:05.238]  What do you think property tax and all the other taxes and all the other things you pay into the federal government?
[02:24:05.478 --> 02:24:06.539]  There are hundreds of taxes.
[02:24:06.559 --> 02:24:07.861]  A lot of them are unconstitutional too.
[02:24:08.281 --> 02:24:10.063]  But there are quite a few that aren't constitutional.
[02:24:10.783 --> 02:24:14.246]  By the way, the income tax first showed up in the Communist Manifesto.
[02:24:15.748 --> 02:24:18.090]  Again, because it was written by the globalists as a way to consolidate.
[02:24:18.290 --> 02:24:24.175]  They said, we want a central bank, an income tax, a property tax, public schools, get you in the system.
[02:24:24.821 --> 02:24:26.362]  Again, it's bigger than just communism.
[02:24:26.602 --> 02:24:31.105]  That's one flavor of the New World Order, and they want this in place.
[02:24:31.786 --> 02:24:36.509]  But Cavuto knows he's got an idiot audience who's sitting back going, how are we going to have money?
[02:24:36.529 --> 02:24:38.631]  We don't have the income tax.
[02:24:39.831 --> 02:24:40.232]  Here it is.
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:45.461]  Okay, well this is Ed Brown.
[02:24:45.521 --> 02:24:49.303]  He and his wife have been convicted of tax evasion for refusing to pay Uncle Sam.
[02:24:49.323 --> 02:24:54.106]  They're holed up in their New Hampshire home, threatening violence if the feds come to arrest them.
[02:24:54.566 --> 02:24:55.547]  This is Ron Paul.
[02:24:55.587 --> 02:24:59.409]  He is a Republican congressman from Texas, and he's running for President of the United States.
[02:24:59.489 --> 02:25:05.413]  And he says that those people who won't pay their taxes should be compared to Gandhi and Martin Luther King.
[02:25:05.793 --> 02:25:06.834]  He's here to explain.
[02:25:08.194 --> 02:25:11.576]  Alright, these guys are holed up in there, and they're heroes to you.
[02:25:11.817 --> 02:25:12.337]  Right, Congressman?
[02:25:13.041 --> 02:25:13.381]  Wrong.
[02:25:13.701 --> 02:25:13.961]  Wrong.
[02:25:14.021 --> 02:25:16.862]  I've never said that because I preach non-violence.
[02:25:16.902 --> 02:25:20.363]  That's what Martin Luther King preached, and that's what Gandhi preached.
[02:25:20.383 --> 02:25:22.684]  That's what Lysander Spooner preached.
[02:25:23.144 --> 02:25:25.225]  So no, I don't advocate violence at all.
[02:25:25.305 --> 02:25:33.908]  And people who resist the law and challenge bad laws, which I think the IRS is, they're capable of passing and regulating bad laws.
[02:25:34.368 --> 02:25:40.330]  So people have an obligation if they feel that there's an injustice to stand up, that they have to bear the consequences.
[02:25:40.470 --> 02:25:46.252]  So, Congressman, you're not saying Ed and Elaine Brown can be compared to Gandhi?
[02:25:46.532 --> 02:25:47.252]  I never said that.
[02:25:47.292 --> 02:25:49.332]  Matter of fact, I know very little about that case.
[02:25:49.433 --> 02:25:50.473]  I've never talked to them.
[02:25:50.573 --> 02:25:51.673]  I don't know the details.
[02:25:52.293 --> 02:25:55.674]  And I think that there's been some misstatements made about that.
[02:25:55.774 --> 02:26:01.876]  Okay, so these statements that you did apparently link to that, you're saying that is not the case?
[02:26:02.825 --> 02:26:04.926]  No, because I've never advocated violence.
[02:26:05.246 --> 02:26:08.648]  I don't believe in violence, but I believe in civil disobedience.
[02:26:09.069 --> 02:26:13.251]  But you have to do that with the realization that you could end up in prison.
[02:26:13.591 --> 02:26:16.913]  You know, we're talking about laws that are unjust laws.
[02:26:16.933 --> 02:26:20.295]  We're talking about an unconstitutional approach to collecting taxes.
[02:26:20.315 --> 02:26:21.816]  So you don't believe anyone should pay taxes?
[02:26:25.063 --> 02:26:28.187]  Well, I think if you don't like the tax law, you should change it.
[02:26:28.227 --> 02:26:30.690]  That's why I run for Congress, and that's why I run for the presidency.
[02:26:30.970 --> 02:26:36.157]  To get rid of the IRS, because the assumption... These guys are doing way better though, Congress, and they don't want to pay taxes.
[02:26:37.714 --> 02:26:39.196]  Well, I don't want to pay it either.
[02:26:39.276 --> 02:26:40.557]  I'd like to get rid of the IRS.
[02:26:40.617 --> 02:26:42.098]  I want to get rid of the income tax.
[02:26:42.158 --> 02:26:44.060]  I want to repeal the 16th Amendment.
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:57.513]  But you have to realize, and let me finish if you will, the system has worked unconstitutionally because everybody who challenges the law is considered guilty because they have to prove themselves innocent.
[02:26:57.553 --> 02:26:58.914]  They start off with a guilty plea.
[02:26:58.934 --> 02:27:00.496]  That's the way the tax code works.
[02:27:01.116 --> 02:27:07.841]  And what I challenge it on constitutional basis, I challenge it on economic basis, and I just don't think it's part of the American spirit.
[02:27:07.861 --> 02:27:10.423]  We've only had this income tax for a small number of years.
[02:27:10.483 --> 02:27:12.204]  Okay, Congressman, I want to be clear.
[02:27:12.364 --> 02:27:14.766]  So you're saying you're against
[02:27:15.882 --> 02:27:16.242]  Taxes.
[02:27:16.562 --> 02:27:17.003]  Stay there.
[02:27:17.123 --> 02:27:19.104]  See, see, Cavuto keeps going, taxes.
[02:27:19.404 --> 02:27:22.466]  No, this private tax for the Federal Reserve.
[02:27:23.046 --> 02:27:28.950]  It's only been around since 1913, and we've only been paying about 2% since the late 1940s.
[02:27:29.590 --> 02:27:31.672]  Okay, Cavuto, and you know that, you pig.
[02:27:35.334 --> 02:27:36.354]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.735 --> 02:27:38.336]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.356 --> 02:27:41.958]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.088 --> 02:27:51.211]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:27:51.431 --> 02:27:53.192]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:27:53.472 --> 02:27:59.756]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:28:00.037 --> 02:28:06.161]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:28:06.421 --> 02:28:08.262]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:28:08.522 --> 02:28:08.882]  I think so.
[02:28:31.031 --> 02:28:32.052]  Eliminate the cause!

[02:28:38.296 --> 02:28:39.176]  1-866-885-6625.

[02:29:44.986 --> 02:29:49.029]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:49.250 --> 02:29:52.652]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:52.832 --> 02:29:56.335]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:56.575 --> 02:29:59.838]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:29:59.858 --> 02:30:05.302]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:30:05.342 --> 02:30:10.567]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal form it's like Cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:11.207 --> 02:30:11.608]  Thank you.
[02:30:22.379 --> 02:30:26.863]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:26.883 --> 02:30:28.245]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:28.425 --> 02:30:32.249]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:33.169]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[02:31:00.457 --> 02:31:08.259]  Your own personal Jesus.
[02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:10.960]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[02:31:11.520 --> 02:31:12.860]  Someone who cares.
[02:31:16.443 --> 02:31:23.888]  Alright, continuing with these clips.
[02:31:24.248 --> 02:31:28.170]  So Cavuto just keeps leaving it real simple, and these propagandists know that.
[02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:34.754]  They're playing the lowest common denominator, the general public, to just hear they don't want to pay their taxes.
[02:31:35.334 --> 02:31:36.354]  Sounds like Ted Kennedy.
[02:31:36.374 --> 02:31:44.419]  Again, if you really listen to Fox News, and take the, you know, some of the basic buzzwords out, and then listen to everything else we're saying, it's like it's
[02:31:45.248 --> 02:31:46.990]  It's like it's Hillary Clinton or something.
[02:31:47.950 --> 02:31:50.633]  But again, they just say they're conservative so it fools everyone.
[02:31:51.934 --> 02:31:56.798]  So here is Cavuto, like he's shocked, like, oh, so you don't think anybody should have to pay their taxes?
[02:31:56.818 --> 02:32:00.662]  You don't think they have to pay their fair share of their taxes?
[02:32:01.582 --> 02:32:05.426]  When every dime of the income tax, every dime,
[02:32:06.724 --> 02:32:09.225]  Goes to pay interest on the national debt.
[02:32:09.505 --> 02:32:10.326]  Why is there a debt?
[02:32:10.346 --> 02:32:13.787]  Because to issue currency, the government agrees to go into debt.
[02:32:14.267 --> 02:32:16.368]  When the government just issued the currency before for free.
[02:32:17.549 --> 02:32:18.569]  As a mode of exchange.
[02:32:19.029 --> 02:32:20.510]  This is how the money changers took over.
[02:32:21.130 --> 02:32:22.511]  And Cabuto knows this.
[02:32:23.331 --> 02:32:24.572]  He does an economics show.
[02:32:25.012 --> 02:32:25.892]  An economy show.
[02:32:26.253 --> 02:32:28.113]  He leaves it real simple.
[02:32:28.874 --> 02:32:30.454]  Again, just snickering.
[02:32:31.015 --> 02:32:33.236]  Laughing at the fools that watch it and believe it.
[02:32:33.576 --> 02:32:35.116]  Loving the deception.
[02:32:35.517 --> 02:32:36.237]  Let's go back to it.
[02:32:37.924 --> 02:32:38.745]  No, I didn't say that.
[02:32:39.165 --> 02:32:45.589]  But I'm against the income tax, and I'm against most taxes, but I'm for limited government.
[02:32:45.649 --> 02:32:47.690]  I'm for limited government, and the taxes are there.
[02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:58.137]  I'm sorry, sir, I want to stick on message here, because these folks, Ed and Elaine Brown have said, and I quote here, all police officers today in this nation are mercenaries.
[02:32:58.317 --> 02:33:01.639]  Talking about the threat that the police might try to force them out of their home.
[02:33:02.100 --> 02:33:03.921]  They are all guns for hire.
[02:33:04.481 --> 02:33:05.422]  Alright, stop, stop.
[02:33:05.802 --> 02:33:08.183]  Number one, he lied about what Ron Paul said about the Browns.
[02:33:08.903 --> 02:33:10.164]  Now he's lying about the Browns.
[02:33:10.184 --> 02:33:11.045]  They said it on the show.
[02:33:11.085 --> 02:33:11.985]  I have the AP quotes.
[02:33:12.365 --> 02:33:19.829]  He said the federal marshals and anybody out there sneaking around their property are mercenaries and they went on to say that a lot of our police are good people and aren't.
[02:33:20.730 --> 02:33:26.353]  Another lie from Fox News, the anti-American scum channel that's behind Hillary Clinton.
[02:33:26.413 --> 02:33:26.933]  Back to them.
[02:33:28.306 --> 02:33:30.288]  Well, those words that I wouldn't use.
[02:33:30.328 --> 02:33:33.652]  I don't know anything about what they're up against, because I don't know the case.
[02:33:33.772 --> 02:33:36.836]  I'm just opposed to the tax system, and I want to change it.
[02:33:36.896 --> 02:33:38.998]  Some people will do it my way, legislatively.
[02:33:39.098 --> 02:33:43.824]  Others will do it by practicing civil disobedience, but they have to realize what the consequence could be.
[02:33:44.464 --> 02:33:52.250]  And, uh, just think of it, see if you can comprehend how Martin Luther King tried to change some very bad laws, and I think we have some very bad tax laws, and I wouldn't change them.
[02:33:52.270 --> 02:34:04.279]  But, Congressman, if everyone in the country were to say, uh, I'm, I'm practicing my, my civil right here to say taxes are wrong, I'm not going to pay them, pretty soon we wouldn't be able to pay for that building.
[02:34:04.619 --> 02:34:07.141]  See, pretty soon we wouldn't be able to pay for that building you're sitting in.
[02:34:07.181 --> 02:34:08.082]  Back it up ten seconds.
[02:34:08.102 --> 02:34:09.803]  I don't think we'll be able to hear that, sorry.
[02:34:11.687 --> 02:34:18.972]  See, again, if people don't pay their taxes... See how it's a possessive term he's using?
[02:34:19.012 --> 02:34:20.333]  It's all psychological warfare.
[02:34:20.913 --> 02:34:21.934]  Their taxes.
[02:34:22.374 --> 02:34:29.499]  Oh, if people don't pay their taxes... Yeah, I think a lot of these constitutional taxes are way too high.
[02:34:29.519 --> 02:34:36.324]  Because it funds all the CPS and for cops to come knock on your door and just say, mind if we search for drugs?
[02:34:37.708 --> 02:34:39.669]  Treating you like you're guilty until proven innocent?
[02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:41.631]  Yeah, the government's got way too much money.
[02:34:42.351 --> 02:34:45.994]  And now they've gotten so corrupt, they're just handing over the whole infrastructure to foreign banks.
[02:34:46.514 --> 02:34:48.075]  Folks, we're in crisis mode!
[02:34:48.675 --> 02:34:50.516]  What can't the illegal aliens get about that?
[02:34:50.577 --> 02:34:52.558]  That they're being used by the new world order to bring down America.
[02:34:52.918 --> 02:34:54.539]  What can't the cops get about this?
[02:34:54.579 --> 02:34:57.281]  The government's gone bad, you need to stop going along with it!
[02:34:58.965 --> 02:35:00.846]  What can't you get through your head?
[02:35:01.307 --> 02:35:02.328]  Back to Ron Paul!
[02:35:02.348 --> 02:35:14.717]  I think we have some very bad tax laws, and I wouldn't say... But, Congressman, if everyone in the country were to say, uh, I'm practicing my civil right here to say taxes are wrong, I'm not going to pay them.
[02:35:15.237 --> 02:35:18.579]  Pretty soon, we wouldn't be able to pay for that building you're standing in.
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:22.302]  We wouldn't be able to pay for your... We wouldn't be able to pay for pretty much anything.
[02:35:22.622 --> 02:35:23.603]  Well, what did they do before 1913?
[02:35:23.763 --> 02:35:26.185]  How did you think they built this building?
[02:35:26.684 --> 02:35:28.505]  You think they'd build it with the income tax?
[02:35:28.805 --> 02:35:34.326]  They'd build it with borrowed money in the 20th century and the Federal Reserve when they print the money when they need it.
[02:35:34.626 --> 02:35:37.067]  So yes, I'm challenging that whole system.
[02:35:37.167 --> 02:35:48.950]  Alright, so if we get rid of the income tax, if everyone in the country takes some sort of pride in what Ed and Elaine Brown are doing by saying they object to income tax.
[02:35:49.071 --> 02:35:50.351]  Everyone did that at the same time.
[02:35:50.931 --> 02:35:52.491]  We'd be in a hurtin' way, wouldn't we?
[02:35:52.872 --> 02:35:57.793]  Well no, we'd be in a, probably in a way where the politicians would have to respond to the people.
[02:35:58.113 --> 02:36:10.656]  If everybody's doing it, it means that the government's not responding to the will of the people, and the will of the people right now, on the side of, they're disgusted with our taxes, and they're disgusted with the IRS, and they're disgusted with the monetary system.
[02:36:10.676 --> 02:36:16.617]  But is the solution, Congressman, to say, I honorably object to paying my taxes, so I won't?
[02:36:17.077 --> 02:36:18.197]  Is that the solution?
[02:36:18.438 --> 02:36:20.278]  Do you endorse that solution?
[02:36:20.638 --> 02:36:32.267]  This is what, yes I do, in the Martin Luther King tradition, in the Lysander Spooner tradition, in the tradition of Gandhi, because they practiced peaceful resistance in order to bring about changes.
[02:36:32.327 --> 02:36:37.170]  And they have brought about miraculous changes in our society over the many, many years.
[02:36:37.610 --> 02:36:39.212]  So there's nothing wrong with that.
[02:36:39.292 --> 02:36:40.933]  I mean, that's in the American spirit.
[02:36:42.694 --> 02:36:47.198]  If you were president of the United States, would your first statement be on January 20th?
[02:37:04.227 --> 02:37:06.790]  You don't have to pay income taxes, nor should you.
[02:37:07.471 --> 02:37:17.101]  No, I wouldn't do that, but I would certainly work with the Congress the proper way and get the Congress to pass a law to change it and to repeal the 16th Amendment.
[02:37:17.502 --> 02:37:21.426]  So no, a president, you're always making the assumption that a president is an authoritarian.
[02:37:22.407 --> 02:37:23.208]  We'll get back.
[02:37:23.228 --> 02:37:23.829]  Paris Hilton.
[02:37:47.777 --> 02:37:50.759]  Again, I've got a Fox News clip we had yesterday.
[02:37:50.779 --> 02:37:51.479]  I never played it.
[02:37:51.499 --> 02:37:53.841]  It was up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:37:53.861 --> 02:37:54.681]  Don't have time to play it.
[02:37:55.362 --> 02:38:00.605]  Where they just argue that, well, Cheney is above the law and Bush is above the law because they are the executive.
[02:38:00.705 --> 02:38:03.266]  So we disagree with Cheney saying he's outside the executive.
[02:38:03.586 --> 02:38:09.490]  But then they argued on Brett Hume, well, maybe because they are the Supreme Lawmakers, maybe they can say they're outside now.
[02:38:10.130 --> 02:38:11.891]  I mean, it was so sick.
[02:38:12.772 --> 02:38:15.273]  I mean, folks, this is dictatorship.
[02:38:15.293 --> 02:38:15.994]  You understand?
[02:38:17.196 --> 02:38:22.062]  Again, it's one thing to have a dictatorship and then to see them implement it in a classical way, which they're gearing up to do.
[02:38:22.782 --> 02:38:26.126]  What do you think going from 300,000 to a million plus cops is all about?
[02:38:26.967 --> 02:38:28.228]  Most of them battle-hardened.
[02:38:30.131 --> 02:38:32.513]  They're not here to play tiddlywinks, okay?
[02:38:33.354 --> 02:38:34.876]  This is very serious, folks.
[02:38:38.119 --> 02:38:38.280]  Now,
[02:38:40.032 --> 02:38:40.993]  I want to play some other clips.
[02:38:41.013 --> 02:38:43.395]  I don't know if I'm going to be able to play this 9-11 clip, but I have this other clip.
[02:38:43.855 --> 02:38:45.137]  This is Network World.
[02:38:45.217 --> 02:38:47.239]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:38:47.679 --> 02:38:52.784]  Lawyers in a how-to video as in how to avoid hiring an American.
[02:38:53.144 --> 02:38:54.626]  This is actually up on JonesReport.com.
[02:38:54.646 --> 02:38:55.807]  I haven't gone up on Prison Planet yet.
[02:38:56.428 --> 02:39:01.933]  Lawyers in a how-to video as in how to avoid hiring an American.
[02:39:04.005 --> 02:39:06.527]  And they're talking about how to not hire Americans.
[02:39:06.747 --> 02:39:09.830]  This is a big corporate job seminar.
[02:39:10.911 --> 02:39:21.900]  And it's just like the guy that has that show Real Money, Kramer, went on a TV show and said how he breaks the law every day, and how he teaches people how to break the law, and how they short the market, and how they destroy stocks.
[02:39:22.361 --> 02:39:23.341]  I mean, folks, let me tell you something.
[02:39:24.642 --> 02:39:27.545]  When I say the government ships in the narcotics, they ship it in.
[02:39:28.416 --> 02:39:34.280]  And then they try to wage war on the smaller cartels that are shipping in maybe 10-15% of it that they don't get a cut of.
[02:39:35.861 --> 02:39:40.325]  When I tell you the government kidnaps children and runs snuff films and does all that, I got mainstream news.
[02:39:41.085 --> 02:39:44.908]  Let me tell you folks, if you actually research... I was thinking about that in the shower this morning.
[02:39:44.928 --> 02:39:47.790]  I'm sitting there taking a shower, hurrying to wash my hair, get out, brush my teeth, go to work.
[02:39:47.810 --> 02:39:51.472]  And I'm just thinking, God, the New World Order is so evil, they're so bad.
[02:39:52.833 --> 02:39:53.894]  How do I warn people?
[02:39:53.934 --> 02:39:55.155]  How do I get folks to wake up?
[02:39:55.215 --> 02:39:56.336]  How do I get them to take action?
[02:39:57.535 --> 02:39:58.935]  I just started thinking about FBI agents.
[02:39:58.975 --> 02:40:04.837]  I was just like... I mean, it's really true that Dying Corp and Halliburton run giant kidnapping rings.
[02:40:05.617 --> 02:40:08.838]  And I was thinking, God, I got those Senate hearings where they're admitting it in testimony.
[02:40:09.538 --> 02:40:17.260]  And I was thinking, God, they're doing all these crimes, and Cheney's Cheney's above the law, and all these no-bid contracts to offshore corporations.
[02:40:17.301 --> 02:40:22.522]  And I was just thinking, God, and I just thought about... I just pictured an FBI agent listening to my show.
[02:40:24.358 --> 02:40:29.700]  And I just thought, well, I'll go on there today and I'll challenge them to just check out what I'm saying.
[02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:33.802]  And then I realized a lot of these guys, they don't even challenge what I say.
[02:40:33.822 --> 02:40:40.165]  They know it's true, but they've just decided to, I guess, be on the winning team and they think this is good or something.
[02:40:41.065 --> 02:40:41.846]  I don't know, man.
[02:40:41.906 --> 02:40:42.666]  I'm freaked out.
[02:40:42.686 --> 02:40:44.567]  I mean, I don't know how you couldn't be freaked out.
[02:40:45.007 --> 02:40:46.347]  These people freak me out.
[02:40:47.848 --> 02:40:49.849]  But all I know how to do is stand up and fight something.
[02:40:51.795 --> 02:40:53.696]  I mean, I know running won't keep me safe.
[02:40:53.736 --> 02:41:00.038]  Believe me, fight or flight, if I thought running would keep me safe, and if I thought running would be the way to handle things, I'd run.
[02:41:00.798 --> 02:41:01.998]  You can't run from these people.
[02:41:02.018 --> 02:41:02.819]  There's nowhere to run.
[02:41:02.839 --> 02:41:05.259]  They've already seen to that.
[02:41:05.359 --> 02:41:06.300]  You can only fight them.
[02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:10.781]  And going along with them and keeping your head down is the worst possible course.
[02:41:11.441 --> 02:41:13.742]  These are the bloodiest killers you can imagine.
[02:41:13.762 --> 02:41:15.423]  They've got to be met head on.
[02:41:18.670 --> 02:41:22.452]  I'm sure a lot of you have been in fights in your life or had a lot of bad things happen.
[02:41:22.492 --> 02:41:23.892]  It's like being in a burning building.
[02:41:23.912 --> 02:41:24.593]  There's no way out.
[02:41:24.633 --> 02:41:29.375]  You're three stories up, four stories up, and you know you're going to probably break both your legs and maybe even die.
[02:41:30.776 --> 02:41:33.238]  But you're going to burn up if you don't jump out.
[02:41:33.278 --> 02:41:34.458]  You just go ahead and jump out.
[02:41:35.018 --> 02:41:36.479]  My back's against the wall, folks.
[02:41:37.440 --> 02:41:39.581]  Even if you don't know your back's against the wall, it's against it.
[02:41:42.581 --> 02:41:46.285]  I want to tell the police and military, they put the same stuff in your food they put in ours.
[02:41:46.725 --> 02:41:48.307]  And in my opinion, they're poisoning it.
[02:41:48.567 --> 02:41:50.028]  They're doing it a thousand different ways.
[02:41:50.949 --> 02:41:53.671]  And in my opinion, these people openly say they want to kill most of us.
[02:41:54.652 --> 02:41:55.553]  That's what I was thinking about.
[02:41:55.573 --> 02:41:56.194]  I was picturing...
[02:41:57.555 --> 02:42:14.706]  If I had the time individually to sit down with every FBI agent who's still got a soul, or every cop, or every BATF and go, look, here's Henry Kissinger saying they want to kill half of us to start with, and how they need to forcibly sterilize, and how the soldiers are crap, and here's all these documents.
[02:42:15.660 --> 02:42:18.141]  A lot of them would just say it wasn't real and would refuse to look at it.
[02:42:18.721 --> 02:42:20.021]  Others would say, yeah, so what?
[02:42:20.061 --> 02:42:21.102]  Maybe that's what we need.
[02:42:21.142 --> 02:42:23.102]  And others would say, okay, it's bad.
[02:42:23.122 --> 02:42:24.223]  What am I supposed to do about it?
[02:42:24.523 --> 02:42:26.263]  I don't know what you're supposed to do about it!
[02:42:26.543 --> 02:42:27.804]  I don't know what to do about it!
[02:42:30.285 --> 02:42:31.225]  I want to be your friend.
[02:42:31.265 --> 02:42:32.185]  I want to respect you.
[02:42:32.205 --> 02:42:33.105]  I want to admire you.
[02:42:33.426 --> 02:42:34.086]  I can't!
[02:42:36.567 --> 02:42:38.387]  I want everything to go back to being good.
[02:42:38.447 --> 02:42:39.727]  I want everything to be nice.
[02:42:40.088 --> 02:42:41.008]  I don't like this.
[02:42:43.272 --> 02:42:48.773]  I don't like having to get up here and call you criminals, but you've got to recognize you're involved in criminal activity.
[02:42:49.034 --> 02:42:50.934]  Government is completely out of control!
[02:42:51.794 --> 02:42:52.514]  Completely!
[02:42:57.956 --> 02:43:10.719]  I mean, I glaze over it every day when I say that government... The UN has been caught kidnapping and trafficking from 2000 to 2002 alone in 1.1 million children and women in Central Europe alone.
[02:43:11.986 --> 02:43:13.047]  That's a BBC headline.
[02:43:13.588 --> 02:43:18.172]  Folks, when you start thinking about those numbers, but it's like the other numbers of 200 million killed by governments last century.
[02:43:18.913 --> 02:43:20.434]  This stuff's always ongoing.
[02:43:20.474 --> 02:43:22.256]  They got massacres going all over the world.
[02:43:22.276 --> 02:43:23.077]  The UN's running.
[02:43:24.838 --> 02:43:25.979]  I'm freaked out, folks.
[02:43:27.921 --> 02:43:28.942]  I'm real freaked out.
[02:43:31.284 --> 02:43:35.428]  And I can't even get my mind around 200 million killed.
[02:43:38.010 --> 02:43:41.953]  Let me plug a few sponsors and then I'm going to play this audio clip and try to get to the last one we've got.
[02:43:44.275 --> 02:43:48.558]  Solutions from Science in Thomas, Illinois has made this offer as easy to swallow as possible.
[02:43:48.998 --> 02:43:57.084]  So I've asked Solutions from Science to send you a three-month supply of their product called Shilicene and open a special line of credit for my listeners so you don't have to pay up front.
[02:43:57.524 --> 02:43:59.345]  It's pretty easy to have some sent to you.
[02:44:00.186 --> 02:44:04.109]  Just go to their website and get some and of course don't pay anything right now.
[02:44:04.901 --> 02:44:06.022]  No credit card, nothing.
[02:44:06.062 --> 02:44:08.383]  Just address, name, they'll send you an invoice.
[02:44:08.403 --> 02:44:12.444]  If you want more in three months, pay for what you got and get your second amount.
[02:44:13.085 --> 02:44:14.425]  Blightless at Herbs.com.
[02:44:14.465 --> 02:44:17.626]  It's in 84 different types of minerals in ionic form.
[02:44:18.327 --> 02:44:19.067]  And I've been taking it.
[02:44:19.287 --> 02:44:21.128]  I'm not going to sell anything here I'm not taking.
[02:44:21.488 --> 02:44:23.009]  I took it before I took them as a sponsor.
[02:44:23.469 --> 02:44:24.089]  It's good stuff.
[02:44:24.629 --> 02:44:26.270]  Here's what they mean by that.
[02:44:26.310 --> 02:44:30.272]  Solutions from Science won't even let you pay with a credit card if you don't want to.
[02:44:31.198 --> 02:44:32.619]  They don't want you to run up your credit card.
[02:44:32.679 --> 02:44:41.022]  No, ladies and gentlemen, they are so confident that you'll like it and really have good effects and nutritive effects from it, that they're going to send it to you and then you can pay if you want more.

[02:45:06.876 --> 02:45:12.939]  Hundreds of great products, and their best-selling one is LIV52, the world's best-selling liver support formula, period.
[02:45:12.959 --> 02:45:16.801]  It's clinically proven to be very beneficial for the liver.
[02:45:17.061 --> 02:45:24.945]  A herbal registered drug in 45 countries, endorsed by over 200,000 healthcare professionals, over 300 clinical trials and research studies.
[02:45:26.346 --> 02:45:36.412]  Lipitude neutralizes all kinds of toxins and poisons from the food you eat, the water you drink, and the air you breathe, even prescription medications, which are all sources of detrimental effects on the liver.

[02:45:40.695 --> 02:45:42.255]  Man, I really haven't properly plugged it all day.
[02:45:42.376 --> 02:45:44.257]  I'm going to try to do it right now.
[02:45:44.277 --> 02:45:46.058]  I get sick of talking about them, frankly.
[02:45:55.558 --> 02:45:56.599]  I just wish you'd buy them.
[02:45:57.760 --> 02:46:00.243]  Because it's how we fund this operation, but that's secondary.
[02:46:01.004 --> 02:46:02.685]  The main thing is, these are powerful videos.
[02:46:02.705 --> 02:46:04.087]  I mean, my Police State Trilogy.
[02:46:05.328 --> 02:46:08.931]  I've got Marines training to put you and your family in camps and take your children from you.
[02:46:09.632 --> 02:46:09.952]  Okay?
[02:46:11.214 --> 02:46:11.994]  That's in Police State 2000.
[02:46:13.076 --> 02:46:16.219]  I got Delta Force trying to rob police chiefs and blowing up buildings.
[02:46:16.899 --> 02:46:17.440]  In Texas.
[02:46:18.561 --> 02:46:19.522]  Terrorizing the public.
[02:46:20.248 --> 02:46:20.809]  By design.
[02:46:20.849 --> 02:46:24.292]  Now they've announced what we told you back in 99 what it was for.
[02:46:24.772 --> 02:46:26.294]  Military occupation of the U.S.
[02:46:27.475 --> 02:46:29.457]  Those three films, 45% off.
[02:46:29.597 --> 02:46:30.297]  All three films.
[02:46:30.317 --> 02:46:32.359]  You can get all three films together in a box set.
[02:46:32.379 --> 02:46:33.440]  45% off.

[02:46:40.607 --> 02:46:42.469]  Not a fancy name, but powerful info.
[02:46:42.949 --> 02:46:47.533]  Find out about the double set of books and how foreign corporations literally own 75% of the country.
[02:46:47.833 --> 02:46:48.954]  When I made the film, it was 70%.
[02:46:49.174 --> 02:46:50.035]  Now it's over 75%.
[02:46:51.436 --> 02:46:53.157]  There's no reason to even have free markets.
[02:46:53.218 --> 02:46:54.759]  Once they get to about 90%, it's over.
[02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:57.861]  You better get that DVD.
[02:46:57.901 --> 02:47:04.467]  You need to get all the other great DVDs I carry about other researchers, like Loose Change 2nd Edition or 9-11 Demolitions.

[02:47:09.024 --> 02:47:09.825]  Riddles in stone.

[02:48:10.967 --> 02:48:14.590]  It's PrisonPlanet.tv, a factory of resistance.

[02:48:34.093 --> 02:48:40.175]  Final segment, I'm going to come back and play this clip where the lawyer is teaching everybody how to get around the law and not hire U.S.
[02:48:40.195 --> 02:48:40.696]  citizens.
[02:48:42.616 --> 02:48:53.561]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:53.921 --> 02:49:01.544]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.239 --> 02:49:09.302]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.702 --> 02:49:21.147]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.427 --> 02:49:24.949]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.409 --> 02:49:27.330]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.670 --> 02:49:31.512]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.764 --> 02:49:49.865]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:49:49.925 --> 02:49:57.227]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[02:49:57.387 --> 02:50:07.669]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[02:50:08.209 --> 02:50:12.750]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:50:13.030 --> 02:50:18.034]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water, like food coloring particles.
[02:50:18.234 --> 02:50:21.176]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:21.396 --> 02:50:31.203]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[02:50:44.907 --> 02:50:46.608]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:46.828 --> 02:50:50.549]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:50.869 --> 02:50:59.793]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:59.953 --> 02:51:04.835]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.055 --> 02:51:14.059]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:14.399 --> 02:51:20.401]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.
[02:51:20.661 --> 02:51:22.142]  Turn your internet on and off.
[02:51:22.162 --> 02:51:22.762]  I think so.
[02:51:56.059 --> 02:51:56.939]  It's really simple.
[02:51:57.019 --> 02:52:11.043]  Foreign interests came in, bought up the country, took over our banking system, took over the Federal Reserve, set it up, and they're in the final phases of looting us out right now, and they're going to leave behind a big police state so we can't come after them.
[02:52:11.063 --> 02:52:13.503]  You understand cops, military, FBI?
[02:52:13.523 --> 02:52:19.445]  You're just a rearguard retreat group.
[02:52:19.485 --> 02:52:23.666]  You're just defending the retreat in the orderly implosion of the country.
[02:52:24.566 --> 02:52:25.446]  So enjoy yourselves!
[02:52:28.641 --> 02:52:29.841]  This is out of Network World.
[02:52:29.881 --> 02:52:31.622]  It's up on JonesReport.com.
[02:52:31.682 --> 02:52:36.644]  Lawyers in a how-to video as in how to avoid hiring an American.
[02:52:36.684 --> 02:52:47.388]  Watch this video and keep in mind the next time you hear a high-ranking tech industry titan such as Bill Gates complain that he simply cannot find qualified American employees and therefore the country needs more HB1 visas.
[02:52:48.092 --> 02:52:58.934]  You'll see a panel discussion that looks like a sit-down with the families of the Sopranos, only instead of talking about organized crime, these lawyers are discussing the ins and outs of helping employers, besides the immigration law.
[02:52:59.534 --> 02:53:03.195]  And that's globalism, not just that it's good for the companies, they want to destroy the middle class here.
[02:53:05.155 --> 02:53:08.415]  And they always say the illegal aliens want to pick, you know, strawberries and things.
[02:53:08.435 --> 02:53:12.136]  The main deal in that immigration bill was unlimited, skilled visas.
[02:53:14.396 --> 02:53:15.817]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to the tape.
[02:53:15.837 --> 02:53:16.117]  Here it is.
[02:53:18.755 --> 02:53:21.336]  So, we're now in the recruitment phase.
[02:53:21.536 --> 02:53:24.198]  We're starting out the perm process.
[02:53:24.338 --> 02:53:32.522]  We've spoken with the HR manager, we've spoken with the employee, we've spoken with the immigration specialist, and we are ready to roll here.
[02:53:32.942 --> 02:53:34.683]  We're starting the recruitment campaign.
[02:53:35.383 --> 02:53:38.044]  And the person calls in and speaks to Jen Pack.
[02:53:38.504 --> 02:53:41.646]  Jen, what type of recruitment is required for the perm process?
[02:53:42.006 --> 02:53:50.191]  The last required recruitment step is two Sunday advertisements in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of employment.
[02:53:50.772 --> 02:53:54.914]  In the Pittsburgh area, we typically use the Post Gazette or the Tribune Review.
[02:53:56.295 --> 02:54:06.181]  Now, the wage that's being offered to the foreign national as part of the green card process must only be included in the internal posting, and that's the document that you hang on the bulletin board.
[02:54:06.402 --> 02:54:08.483]  So, again, putting all that together,
[02:54:09.044 --> 02:54:18.943]  What is our, if we would have a sort of a standard three options, what do we typically use as our three other recruitment sources?
[02:54:20.314 --> 02:54:21.195]  That's fine.
[02:54:21.215 --> 02:54:31.020]  It would be the newspaper's website when posted there in conjunction with the typical print ad.
[02:54:31.481 --> 02:54:34.683]  A local newspaper and employer's website.
[02:54:34.723 --> 02:54:36.724]  Those are the ones that I see most often.
[02:54:37.004 --> 02:54:44.268]  Yeah, because our goal here, of course, is to meet the requirements, number one, but also do so as inexpensively as possible.
[02:54:45.046 --> 02:54:46.288]  Keeping in mind our goal.
[02:54:46.548 --> 02:54:50.833]  And our goal is clearly not to find a qualified and interested U.S.
[02:54:50.873 --> 02:54:51.193]  worker.
[02:54:52.114 --> 02:54:57.280]  And, you know, that, in a sense, that sounds funny, but it's what we're trying to do here.
[02:54:58.855 --> 02:55:06.422]  We are complying with the law fully, but our objective is to get this person a green card and to get through the labor certification process.
[02:55:06.923 --> 02:55:12.809]  So certainly we are not going to try to find the place where the applicants are going to be the most numerous.
[02:55:13.189 --> 02:55:17.254]  We're going to try to find a place where, again, we're complying with the law and hoping
[02:55:17.754 --> 02:55:21.917]  And likely not to find qualified and interested worker applicants.
[02:55:21.977 --> 02:55:33.503]  So that's the process that we will go through with you from the beginning on where Jen or Jen or somebody else on our team will go over with you what three options are we going to select.
[02:55:33.724 --> 02:55:34.284]  Okay.
[02:55:35.184 --> 02:55:37.206]  So they can claim they can't find workers.
[02:55:37.226 --> 02:55:40.067]  It's the same thing with polls that don't show Ron Paul.
[02:55:40.948 --> 02:55:46.031]  Literally an old lady who's had two strokes and doesn't even know her name anymore, she's the one who gets the poll questions.
[02:55:47.495 --> 02:55:48.596]  I mean, that's how they run these polls.
[02:55:48.616 --> 02:55:50.478]  They have certain areas, they know certain demographics.
[02:55:52.419 --> 02:55:53.340]  They're slick, folks.
[02:55:54.361 --> 02:55:56.703]  But again, they're like feeding on what's left of the carcass.
[02:55:56.743 --> 02:55:58.665]  It's all like in a 24-hour turnaround now.
[02:55:58.685 --> 02:56:01.087]  They're not even thinking about a year ahead.
[02:56:02.288 --> 02:56:04.730]  I mean, when the Depression comes, it's going to be so massive.
[02:56:05.210 --> 02:56:08.193]  There'll just be cops everywhere in black uniforms ruling over us.
[02:56:08.994 --> 02:56:10.535]  But they're ruling over a dead body.
[02:56:10.555 --> 02:56:14.018]  I mean, they're ruling over a pile of donkey poo.
[02:56:14.258 --> 02:56:15.059]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:56:15.831 --> 02:56:17.572]  God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:17.592 --> 02:56:18.952]  Another huge show tomorrow.
[02:56:19.232 --> 02:56:20.393]  Thank you all for tuning in.
[02:56:20.433 --> 02:56:20.893]  Take care.
