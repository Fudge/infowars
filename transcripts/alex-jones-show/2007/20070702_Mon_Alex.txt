[00:00:05.507 --> 00:00:09.731]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.372 --> 00:00:11.172]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.933 --> 00:00:12.814]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.495 --> 00:00:17.158]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.698 --> 00:00:21.782]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:39.177]  It is already the second day of July 2007.
[00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:42.679]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:54.424]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we will continue to watch all the new terror developments, just as we covered the London bombings of two years ago in 2005.
[00:00:54.464 --> 00:00:55.205]  On July 7th, the 7-7 bombings.
[00:01:00.402 --> 00:01:05.365]  The question is, will there be more bombings on 7-7-7?
[00:01:05.985 --> 00:01:10.467]  Feds gear up for summer of all fear-mongering.
[00:01:12.208 --> 00:01:14.229]  The great summer of fear-mongering.
[00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.172]  It's always a secret report, but then the Feds leak it.
[00:01:18.732 --> 00:01:19.853]  Secret document.
[00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:20.273]  U.S.
[00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:20.793]  fears.
[00:01:21.293 --> 00:01:23.975]  Terror-spectacular!
[00:01:25.456 --> 00:01:28.017]  They use words like that to get to your mind.
[00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.509]  I've got a lot of analysis to go over today on this.
[00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.709]  We'll obviously open the phones up and take your calls.
[00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.531]  I have never seen such fear-mongering as we are now seeing on this subject, watching Fox News.
[00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:44.272]  Here's a quote.
[00:01:46.072 --> 00:01:58.275]  A fiery inferno, a fiery holocaust, deep black, billowing smoke, thousands could have died
[00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:02.547]  Untold carnage!
[00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:05.049]  Spectacular!
[00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.492]  Summer of terror!
[00:02:08.072 --> 00:02:09.954]  Brace in fear!
[00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:18.022]  Wall to wall, complete and total, absolute fear mongering.
[00:02:18.182 --> 00:02:22.467]  And if you look at the real definitions of terrorism, it is using an action, a
[00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:24.243]  We're good to go.
[00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.072]  From the western world, you are 400 times more likely to die in an automobile accident than you are from terrorism.
[00:02:56.953 --> 00:02:57.733]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:02:57.813 --> 00:02:59.534]  They're hyping it.
[00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:03.315]  And back, of course, in the 1970s when we had over 130 real terror attacks in the U.S.
[00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:10.336]  It got almost no play in the newspapers.
[00:03:10.376 --> 00:03:12.537]  I mean, these were attacks on police stations.
[00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:15.239]  These were attacks killing cops.
[00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.600]  The majority of the attacks were on police.
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.542]  And it was all kept very, very quiet because they were real.
[00:03:22.562 --> 00:03:26.024]  And when it's real, you don't hype it.
[00:03:26.864 --> 00:03:28.725]  Because that's what terrorists want.
[00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:30.826]  Yeah, I'm going to go over some history of this today.
[00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:33.027]  We should write an article about this and explain this to people.
[00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:36.669]  This is 101 Basic Terrorism History.
[00:03:37.313 --> 00:03:43.496]  But first we'll go over all the latest developments concerning this and how they're saying brace for Baghdad, USA.
[00:03:44.217 --> 00:03:52.661]  There's going to be bombings on a weekly basis and it's the new life, but there's no calls to deport the Muslims, no calls to slow down their immigration here.
[00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.362]  Now again, I'm not even attacking Muslims.
[00:03:55.402 --> 00:04:00.645]  My point here is that this was a real threat, a true organic threat, and the state cared.
[00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:04.547]  They wanted to keep us safe because they love us so much.
[00:04:05.547 --> 00:04:16.114]  They would be completely halting Muslim immigration, Middle Eastern, Central Asian immigration, Muslim Asian immigration, Southeast Asian Muslim immigration.
[00:04:16.894 --> 00:04:22.518]  No, they're accelerating it at every level and reapplying political correctness to everyone.
[00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:28.401]  So, we'll go over the skinning today on this and then get into the real news.
[00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:32.564]  Are they getting ready for bigger stage terror attacks in the United States and England?
[00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:33.705]  And I think the answer is
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.800]  Unfortunately, yes.
[00:04:38.781 --> 00:04:40.561]  Unless we get the word out on who's behind this.
[00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:41.641]  This is the big move.
[00:04:42.402 --> 00:04:48.763]  We'll put all the pieces of the puzzle together on the other side and talk about Joe Lieberman.
[00:04:49.343 --> 00:04:50.363]  Lieberman calls.
[00:04:51.303 --> 00:04:57.385]  Well, we'll tell you what he says will keep you safe on the other side of this break.
[00:04:58.085 --> 00:04:58.505]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.398 --> 00:05:09.845]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.225 --> 00:05:17.855]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:25.600]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:37.426]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.746 --> 00:05:41.668]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.688 --> 00:05:43.649]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.811]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:11.144]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as Triamethylenes, Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.384 --> 00:06:22.609]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.091]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury and aluminum are
[00:06:28.131 --> 00:06:28.671]  No problem.
[00:06:28.912 --> 00:06:35.537]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:35.777 --> 00:06:42.603]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:42.883 --> 00:06:44.644]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:46.886]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements

[00:07:03.194 --> 00:07:07.338]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:07:07.558 --> 00:07:09.319]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:15.865]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:07:16.165 --> 00:07:22.290]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:07:22.531 --> 00:07:24.292]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:24.552]  We're good.
[00:07:47.137 --> 00:07:48.178]  Eliminate the cause!

[00:08:05.712 --> 00:08:06.352]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:08.093]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.794 --> 00:08:09.935]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:11.375]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.136 --> 00:08:12.996]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.697 --> 00:08:17.619]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:22.002]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:57.889]  Well, the emergency alert system that controls every radio and TV station in the country, it's a device wired in by FEMA by law, put in in 1996, accidentally took over yesterday and reported that we were being attacked and freaked everybody out.
[00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.791]  Make no mistake, that was not a mistake.
[00:09:02.566 --> 00:09:05.508]  And so we'll be going over that today.
[00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:19.138]  Really, this London bombing situation is the opening salvo in the next phase of the New World Order's War on Liberty, which they smokescreen under the War on Terror.
[00:09:20.979 --> 00:09:26.583]  Now, I've talked a lot about this in the past, but let me just briefly recap it and then get into the latest developments here.
[00:09:28.408 --> 00:09:33.012]  There are four different types of terror and several sub-designations under each type.
[00:09:33.752 --> 00:09:36.094]  This is my own charting system.
[00:09:36.114 --> 00:09:48.244]  The mainstream media would tell you there's one type, evil terrorists that have long fangs and sneak around in the shadows under your bed or in your closet or around the campfire at night.
[00:09:48.844 --> 00:09:57.471]  But in the real world, there is pure state-sponsored, New World Order spectacular, to use the government's own term,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:07.567]  Buildings turning into powder, jets all off course, 20 plus hijackings, NORAD stand down, big spectacular events.
[00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:15.053]  Gulf of Tonkins, USS Liberties, 9-11s, OKCs.
[00:10:19.496 --> 00:10:23.259]  And then you've got the next type and that is the Provocateur.
[00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:25.941]  There's many different sub-designations of that.
[00:10:26.644 --> 00:10:29.665]  And I know most of you know this, but we need to make sure the general public understands this.
[00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:55.354]  And that's either where you've got a Mossad, Shin Bet, MI6, MI5, CIA, Defense Intelligence, FBI, going out and funding a known Muslim or other terrorist group leader who then sub-pays another go-between who goes out and recruits zealots who go out and get a truck bomb.
[00:10:55.374 --> 00:10:55.974]  But usually they
[00:10:56.866 --> 00:11:12.559]  For somebody dumb enough to be shut up, they can never build their own bomb, they can never get their own detonators, they don't know how, so usually they send in FBI or Shin Bet or Mossad informants who end up commanding them, building all the devices, the weapons, and then even, in a lot of cases, deploying the weapons.
[00:11:13.712 --> 00:11:24.380]  And again, there's case after case after case, declassified, front page of the paper, Dallas Morning News, Jerusalem Post, ABC Nightly News.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.441]  I mean, it's all out there.
[00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:26.902]  I've listed all the cases.
[00:11:28.038 --> 00:11:46.833]  Just three weeks ago, a headline, Jerusalem Post, Shin Bet behind hijacking terror, setting up the Idi Amin, hijacking with Amin, totally staged to demonize the Palestinians so there wouldn't be a peace accord, declassified, we already knew that and already told you, but now it's declassified in public.
[00:11:48.114 --> 00:11:50.897]  I mean, as if people didn't know that, Idi Amin,
[00:11:52.107 --> 00:12:13.555]  Of course, it's part of the history books, but even if you go watch the movie The Last King of Scotland, which is very historical, excellent film, very disturbing, don't take your children to it, about Idi Amin in Uganda, the general, the accordion playing general, and that Scottish doctor who wrote a book about it,
[00:12:15.004 --> 00:12:21.989]  In the film, it shows Mossad running things, but oh, he has a fight with them at the end, and then hates them.
[00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.192]  Mossad helped put Idi Amin in power.
[00:12:26.193 --> 00:12:29.935]  And when he was called on to do a duty, you better believe Idi Amin did it.
[00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:33.258]  Now, we already knew that, but now it's declassified.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:39.743]  And people go, wait a minute, Benjamin Netanyahu's brother died in the raid.
[00:12:41.155 --> 00:12:42.175]  Yuri Netanyahu.
[00:12:42.435 --> 00:12:42.935]  That's right.
[00:12:42.975 --> 00:12:45.476]  They didn't tell the Israeli commandos going in it was staged either.
[00:12:45.716 --> 00:12:47.096]  That's what government does.
[00:12:47.576 --> 00:12:49.757]  They didn't tell the firefighters and cops.
[00:12:49.977 --> 00:12:51.937]  They sent in to the World Trade Centers either.
[00:12:51.957 --> 00:12:54.138]  This isn't a game folks.
[00:12:54.298 --> 00:12:55.398]  I'm putting my life on the line.
[00:12:55.618 --> 00:12:57.379]  Come on the air and put this together.
[00:12:59.959 --> 00:13:02.760]  None of us are safe with these people running things.
[00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:09.890]  There have been like five other examples of admitted state-sponsored terror in the last month since that came out on the Idi Amin deal.
[00:13:10.991 --> 00:13:12.171]  We just mention them here now.
[00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:13.871]  I mean, we just move on.
[00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:15.192]  There's so much evidence.
[00:13:18.792 --> 00:13:22.113]  So, you've got purely state-sponsored spectaculars.
[00:13:22.193 --> 00:13:29.135]  Then you've got the provocateur options where they cook the bomb, train the drivers, run the whole lot.
[00:13:30.359 --> 00:13:49.936]  Or you've got terror that was never really meant to happen, kind of like, I guess you could call it, stillbirth terror, where they go out and find street kids, they profile them off their welfare checks, who are mildly retarded, and the government brings in informants and agents and rents a warehouse or a house.
[00:13:50.516 --> 00:14:11.260]  And tells them, hey, free food, free pizza, free money, free marijuana, just, just, just, you get another 20 grand when you go videotape the FBI building in Miami, and they go videotape it, and they announce, Army of Al Qaeda, set to destroy America, and remember it was on the news, we were facing total destruction, an army assault, systematic and deadly.
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:17.262]  And it turns out they're ages 14 to 18, every one of them on city welfare, registered retarded.
[00:14:18.322 --> 00:14:19.302]  Black street kids.
[00:14:20.296 --> 00:14:22.597]  By the way, part of a Christian Rastafarian group.
[00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:30.942]  Black Street Kids, the ultimate army, set to destroy... I mean, remember?
[00:14:31.742 --> 00:14:34.143]  They were an army to wage jihad!
[00:14:34.423 --> 00:14:37.085]  They wore uniforms, they were incredible, it turns out.
[00:14:37.705 --> 00:14:40.186]  They were literally children with an FBI agent leading them.
[00:14:41.727 --> 00:14:47.090]  You get more money when you take this video camera, let me show you how to use it, and you go videotape this building, you understand?
[00:14:48.078 --> 00:14:54.805]  Or it's Muslim kids up in Toronto shooting their mouths off at the local bars when they're listening to their hip-hop music.
[00:14:55.285 --> 00:14:59.349]  And the informant gets them to shoot their mouth off by, yeah, we ought to kill some people.
[00:14:59.409 --> 00:14:59.830]  Yeah, we ought to.
[00:15:00.130 --> 00:15:01.852]  And then, boom, they deliver the fertilizer.
[00:15:02.172 --> 00:15:04.534]  You go into jail for the rest of your lives.
[00:15:05.955 --> 00:15:09.519]  So you've got the just totally staged stuff where it's never meant to really be an event.
[00:15:12.182 --> 00:15:14.587]  And there's several different types of other provocative actions.
[00:15:14.627 --> 00:15:21.402]  You've got global corporations that go out and stage events and then they just bust patsies that had nothing to do with it.
[00:15:21.923 --> 00:15:22.905]  They literally hired a
[00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:28.330]  You know, do office paperwork around the office and they plant stuff on them.
[00:15:28.791 --> 00:15:31.191]  And Operation Northwest describes how to frame Patsy.
[00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:31.892]  We have U.S.
[00:15:31.912 --> 00:15:34.313]  government documents and manuals on how to frame Patsy.
[00:15:34.613 --> 00:15:35.653]  It's all very detailed.
[00:15:35.833 --> 00:15:37.394]  There's a lot of other subsections to it.
[00:15:37.434 --> 00:15:40.235]  We have many case examples of each variety.
[00:15:40.575 --> 00:15:46.537]  And then you've got real terrorism, which is just asymmetrical warfare, desperation resistance.
[00:15:48.453 --> 00:15:49.834]  And then there's two different types of that.
[00:15:49.974 --> 00:15:55.119]  Generally, these people are, you know, don't have the skills or the focus to do it.
[00:15:55.139 --> 00:15:56.059]  They're not cold-blooded.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.241]  They're very emotional, so they make a lot of mistakes.
[00:15:58.782 --> 00:16:09.090]  And generally, the intelligence agencies are fully aware of what they're doing and open all the doors, grease the skids, hold back local police to let it go forward.
[00:16:10.311 --> 00:16:12.693]  And hundreds of these have been stopped in the U.S.
[00:16:12.753 --> 00:16:17.577]  and overseas in the last 15 years because of security.
[00:16:18.596 --> 00:16:18.916]  Hundreds.
[00:16:19.537 --> 00:16:22.218]  And it's a woman going on a bus, stabbing people.
[00:16:22.559 --> 00:16:27.982]  It's somebody detonating a bomb that's usually crude and might kill them or injure somebody.
[00:16:29.443 --> 00:16:34.226]  Most of the stuff you see in Israel is just stuff blown all over the street and it's some high-powered C4 attack.
[00:16:34.286 --> 00:16:36.027]  It's not a real suicide bombing.
[00:16:36.047 --> 00:16:40.150]  That's come out in Jerusalem Post, Haratz, and other major publications.
[00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:45.053]  You know, Israel, quote, created hundreds of fake Al-Qaeda commandos and had them carrying out attacks.
[00:16:48.911 --> 00:16:50.472]  Why would they want to do that?
[00:16:50.813 --> 00:16:54.175]  Well, number one, it's admitted to all the neocons listening.
[00:16:54.215 --> 00:16:56.277]  So you see, number one, it's admitted.
[00:16:56.297 --> 00:17:00.000]  AP, UPI, Jerusalem Post, Heratz, many other publications.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.662]  So it's not up to us to say why they did it.
[00:17:02.702 --> 00:17:03.462]  Well, we know why.
[00:17:03.883 --> 00:17:05.664]  Why did Hitler fire bomb his own Reichstag?
[00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:07.866]  It's called control.
[00:17:08.747 --> 00:17:10.008]  It's called fear.
[00:17:10.448 --> 00:17:11.749]  It's called legitimizing.
[00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:18.000]  All over the country, people are sick of cops in black uniforms shoving us around, bossing us around, yelling at us.
[00:17:18.381 --> 00:17:19.482]  Checkpoints everywhere.
[00:17:19.502 --> 00:17:24.628]  The government's approval rating, Cheney's has now dropped to 9% in Gallup.
[00:17:24.969 --> 00:17:26.570]  Plunged from 12 two weeks ago.
[00:17:26.971 --> 00:17:28.493]  This is now a complete free fall.
[00:17:28.573 --> 00:17:29.454]  No one has ever had a 12%.
[00:17:29.734 --> 00:17:30.235]  Now it's at 9.
[00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:37.206]  Bush dropped from 30 to 26 and now is 24 points.
[00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:39.727]  They are in free fall mega plunge.
[00:17:40.167 --> 00:17:43.628]  Congress dropped from a 14 percent to an 11.
[00:17:43.888 --> 00:17:50.091]  They are in free fall absolute complete mayday plunge right now.
[00:17:50.251 --> 00:17:51.191]  Thank God!
[00:17:53.152 --> 00:17:54.392]  The paradigm is shattering.
[00:17:54.412 --> 00:17:56.093]  The people are waking up and boom!
[00:17:56.473 --> 00:17:57.594]  The terrorists are going to get us.
[00:17:57.634 --> 00:17:58.694]  But then I'm confused
[00:17:59.665 --> 00:18:08.453]  Because this is so shoddy, so ridiculous, so pathetic, that frankly, my gut, all of my past studying tells me this is real terror in England.
[00:18:10.094 --> 00:18:21.384]  It is the rare example, kind of like there are hundreds of different species of sparrow, and most of them are very common, but there's a few sparrows.
[00:18:22.024 --> 00:18:26.288]  I'm not planning to be an ornithologist, but I do like to read about birds in my off time, when I have time.
[00:18:26.937 --> 00:18:30.200]  And there's a few types of sparrows right here in Central Texas that are very, very rare.
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.382]  And then this is kind of like that.
[00:18:32.402 --> 00:18:33.643]  Oh, it's Greenland!
[00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:34.123]  Oh, my!
[00:18:34.503 --> 00:18:35.144]  Oh, everyone stop!
[00:18:35.924 --> 00:18:37.306]  Don't breathe, it may fly away!
[00:18:37.386 --> 00:18:39.027]  Look, it's a real one!
[00:18:39.728 --> 00:18:40.648]  My goodness!
[00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:44.011]  But then, it's the perfect timing of Gordon Brown coming in.
[00:18:44.932 --> 00:18:51.097]  It's the perfect timing of him saying, we need all these new anti-terror laws, totally abolishing any freedoms the British had left.
[00:18:52.078 --> 00:18:54.920]  On paper, they still have those freedoms, they're free men and women.
[00:18:55.928 --> 00:18:59.511]  And there's a great history of liberty there, which is now being erased with the Magna Carta.
[00:19:01.132 --> 00:19:03.774]  And so, right on time, Brown calls for this.
[00:19:04.135 --> 00:19:04.855]  It happens.
[00:19:06.196 --> 00:19:09.839]  It's just perfect timing with everything that's happening.
[00:19:12.962 --> 00:19:14.083]  When I say it's real,
[00:19:16.577 --> 00:19:25.920]  I am 95% sure that you're going to see, it's going to come out that doors were open, that they knew about these guys, and by the way, I said that last night, it's actually out in the news today.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.721]  Buried in the news articles, it admits, okay, they were watching them, they knew about them, there have been warnings.
[00:19:31.741 --> 00:19:33.242]  Remember the government-specific threats?
[00:19:33.902 --> 00:19:37.203]  Oh, on clubs and airports.
[00:19:37.763 --> 00:19:38.203]  Remember?
[00:19:39.963 --> 00:19:45.725]  See, so this is basically, open the door, you're probably going to find there's a Wahhabiist who's known MI6 above them.
[00:19:47.026 --> 00:19:48.428]  But these guys are real.
[00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:51.832]  I mean, they really think they're fighting a crimson jihad.
[00:19:52.653 --> 00:19:53.894]  Good job, idiots!
[00:19:55.236 --> 00:19:56.737]  Now you've empowered the New World Order.
[00:19:56.757 --> 00:20:00.161]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:04.711]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.331 --> 00:20:14.280]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.721 --> 00:20:21.928]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:28.146]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:21:01.559 --> 00:21:01.999]  Gold.
[00:21:02.339 --> 00:21:03.640]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:09.983]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:21:10.163 --> 00:21:13.985]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:21:14.345 --> 00:21:16.226]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:21:16.266 --> 00:21:18.567]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:21:18.707 --> 00:21:25.930]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every
[00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:26.971]  We're good to go.

[00:22:01.274 --> 00:22:06.497]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:22:06.637 --> 00:22:14.722]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:21.886]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.

[00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:53.809]  Do it today!
[00:23:53.829 --> 00:23:55.750]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:24:13.268 --> 00:24:14.729]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:21.052]  All right, getting back into the situation that we are facing right now.
[00:24:21.292 --> 00:24:31.457]  Just out of the blue, magically, right when the approval ratings are plunging, Tony Blair had to step down with cash for honors, bribes documented.
[00:24:31.477 --> 00:24:34.038]  He's talking about restricting free speech.
[00:24:34.458 --> 00:24:36.919]  He signs England on to Europe.
[00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:38.120]  He tried for
[00:24:39.484 --> 00:24:39.885]  I think so.
[00:24:53.581 --> 00:24:54.622]  Let me just make all that clear.
[00:24:55.122 --> 00:24:57.483]  Getting all these dates, I'm scrambling those.
[00:24:57.703 --> 00:25:09.490]  Tony Blair got into office in 1997 to 2007, and he started pushing from 2000, when Europe was officially formed, with the EU, right through 2007, last week, when he left office.
[00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:17.474]  And Gordon Brown came into office, unelected, parliamentarily appointed,
[00:25:18.427 --> 00:25:22.215]  And this is the guy who openly calls for world government, new world order.
[00:25:22.536 --> 00:25:27.085]  He wants Britons to be allowed to be secretly arrested and secretly held.
[00:25:28.627 --> 00:25:31.048]  I mean, you talk about Nazi Germany, you talk about Russia.
[00:25:31.328 --> 00:25:32.528]  These are the things we're talking about.
[00:25:33.088 --> 00:25:40.910]  Meanwhile, it came out that Tony Blair made secret deals to bring in unlimited levels of immigrants from the Middle East.
[00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:51.953]  He would always give speeches about getting tough, but then it was shown that he made a deal with France to allow them to board the trains and come in unmolested and bypass customs entirely.
[00:25:52.893 --> 00:25:55.415]  Now I caught that on video long before it was admitted.
[00:25:55.435 --> 00:25:58.877]  I'll never forget about 2000 I was watching ITN.
[00:25:59.297 --> 00:26:03.639]  For some reason ITN TV at that time was on PBS 2 here in Austin.
[00:26:03.679 --> 00:26:04.580]  It's not on anymore.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:11.724]  And it said, locals are complaining as the channel train exits.
[00:26:12.424 --> 00:26:18.628]  Every night thousands of illegal immigrants pull in and the police are ordered to stand down
[00:26:19.386 --> 00:26:23.149]  So that there's not an issue, or that there's no crises caused.
[00:26:23.189 --> 00:26:27.252]  There's some bumbling, you know, comment about, so there's not any type of fracas.
[00:26:27.593 --> 00:26:28.233]  Something like that.
[00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:31.576]  And they just show thousands of people rushing, cheering.
[00:26:31.976 --> 00:26:34.838]  They like, they jump off the trains and go, ahhh!
[00:26:35.079 --> 00:26:37.260]  And I'll never forget watching them charge, screaming.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.882]  And I was like, what on earth is that?
[00:26:39.282 --> 00:26:40.003]  So let's be clear.
[00:26:40.443 --> 00:26:47.569]  They build the channel, and then the entire population of the Middle East, that's moved into France, starts just pouring through.
[00:26:49.144 --> 00:26:50.085]  I mean that figuratively.
[00:26:50.105 --> 00:26:55.730]  Just, you know, huge hordes just pouring through and battle-roaring as they scream running.
[00:26:59.213 --> 00:27:04.117]  Meanwhile, you're on the streets of England, folks, and you're just walking around talking to people, videotaping.
[00:27:04.137 --> 00:27:07.460]  Cops run up, real snivelly, get right in your face.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:08.441]  Let me see your name.
[00:27:08.481 --> 00:27:09.702]  Let me see your ID.
[00:27:10.242 --> 00:27:11.904]  Don't you aim that camera at me.
[00:27:12.224 --> 00:27:14.646]  You're being put in a terrorist database.
[00:27:14.666 --> 00:27:16.948]  It's a terrorist database.
[00:27:18.078 --> 00:27:21.701]  Meanwhile, they see somebody with a burka covering the whole body.
[00:27:21.721 --> 00:27:22.902]  They literally go, Hello, ma'am.
[00:27:23.102 --> 00:27:23.582]  Good to see you.
[00:27:24.203 --> 00:27:26.665]  Thank you.
[00:27:27.165 --> 00:27:27.625]  Literally.
[00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:29.447]  Again, that's political correctness.
[00:27:29.507 --> 00:27:33.930]  It's like the illegal aliens running around here, waving their foreign flags, screaming La Reconquista.
[00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.131]  The police are in order.
[00:27:35.171 --> 00:27:35.931]  Don't arrest them.
[00:27:35.951 --> 00:27:36.432]  Stand down.
[00:27:36.492 --> 00:27:36.952]  Let them drive.
[00:27:37.192 --> 00:27:38.433]  Let them do whatever they want.
[00:27:38.493 --> 00:27:39.134]  It's in the news.
[00:27:39.814 --> 00:27:42.877]  But citizens are just like, Get over there, boy.
[00:27:42.917 --> 00:27:44.518]  We run things around here.
[00:27:45.419 --> 00:27:48.640]  I mean, it's just total domination training us to be slaves.
[00:27:50.861 --> 00:27:53.382]  And again, I'm not here attacking Muslims, okay?
[00:27:53.402 --> 00:27:55.783]  But there's propaganda on both sides.
[00:27:55.823 --> 00:28:06.407]  The claim that Muslims don't want to take over and don't want to make everybody convert to Islam and want to kiss us and love on us and are little sweet, angelic, peace-driven creatures is a lie.
[00:28:07.348 --> 00:28:10.689]  There's about 10% of the Muslim population that's extremely radical.
[00:28:11.309 --> 00:28:13.330]  I'd say another 20% that are somewhat radical.
[00:28:14.572 --> 00:28:20.153]  The majority of Muslims are very reasonable people who, frankly, don't like the extremists in their own ranks.
[00:28:21.234 --> 00:28:22.014]  This is the same thing.
[00:28:22.074 --> 00:28:35.177]  Most Christians aren't these fake televangelists, weird mutation of Southern Baptists that literally, I've seen Hagee say, Israel's better than America, Jews are better than everyone, we must worship them.
[00:28:35.197 --> 00:28:36.477]  I mean, that guy's a cult leader.
[00:28:37.577 --> 00:28:40.398]  He's completely, it's embarrassing to watch him.
[00:28:41.198 --> 00:28:42.599]  I have seen him!
[00:28:44.399 --> 00:28:49.381]  Last year I was at a beach house, I told a story, and I was watching Hagee, and my mouth was hanging open.
[00:28:49.661 --> 00:28:57.083]  Then I heard him on WAI one night, driving around, they play in there on the weekends, and he was saying worse stuff.
[00:28:57.143 --> 00:29:00.124]  I mean, it was literally fruitcake land.
[00:29:01.505 --> 00:29:03.546]  It was completely insane.
[00:29:04.066 --> 00:29:07.687]  Do not say that's what the majority, or even a minority of Christians think like.
[00:29:08.527 --> 00:29:10.868]  I mean, it is cocoa for cuckoo puffs.
[00:29:13.530 --> 00:29:15.111]  Cocoa for cuckoo puffs, I know.
[00:29:16.672 --> 00:29:18.473]  Not completely over the edge, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:19.213 --> 00:29:20.634]  But let me get really serious here.
[00:29:20.654 --> 00:29:24.076]  When we get back, I'm going to try to just state it as clearly as I can.
[00:29:25.337 --> 00:29:27.138]  This could be the trial balloon.
[00:29:27.578 --> 00:29:30.860]  This could be the opening salvo in the next big wave of terror attacks.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.141]  That's what the government's saying.
[00:29:33.121 --> 00:29:37.744]  And we'll break down where we're going, what we face as a society.
[00:29:38.925 --> 00:29:41.548]  We'll tell you what Lieberman wants and a lot more.
[00:29:41.568 --> 00:29:46.333]  And we'll also take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:46.834 --> 00:29:47.575]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:47.595 --> 00:29:50.278]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.500]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.961 --> 00:29:54.583]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.484 --> 00:29:58.167]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.511 --> 00:30:05.816]  If you've ever wanted to grow the absolute best-tasting fruits and vegetables imaginable, here's some exciting news!
[00:30:06.016 --> 00:30:08.699]  There's a new product designed to make growing delicious produce easy.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.302]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's dynamite in the garden.
[00:30:11.523 --> 00:30:18.390]  Proto-Gro is a bioactive superfood for plants that works by providing true broad-spectrum nutrition, allowing plants to achieve their full genetic expression.
[00:30:18.571 --> 00:30:19.672]  What does this mean in the garden?
[00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:22.415]  It means mouth-watering fruits and vegetables, brilliantly colored flowers,
[00:30:22.435 --> 00:30:22.955]  We're good to go!
[00:30:47.085 --> 00:30:48.486]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:30:48.526 --> 00:30:50.967]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:50.987 --> 00:30:53.709]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:31:11.744 --> 00:31:18.488]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:05.192]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:32:05.412 --> 00:32:08.814]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:32:08.994 --> 00:32:12.496]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:32:12.736 --> 00:32:15.938]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:32:15.958 --> 00:32:21.482]  This basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[00:32:21.502 --> 00:32:26.725]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[00:32:27.365 --> 00:32:27.766]  Thank you!
[00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.044]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:32:48.064 --> 00:32:48.986]  That toll free number again?
[00:32:49.006 --> 00:32:49.066]  1-877-928-8822.
[00:33:15.074 --> 00:33:21.918]  Feds gear up for a summer of all out fear mongering.
[00:33:21.958 --> 00:33:24.600]  Spectacular is the word they used.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:31.203]  Summer attacks expected as emergency alert drills invade TV and radio.
[00:33:31.363 --> 00:33:34.986]  We're going to be playing that later.
[00:33:35.006 --> 00:33:39.088]  The fake emergency alert terror attack drill.
[00:33:40.329 --> 00:33:42.670]  All of us on the heels of martial law funded
[00:33:44.102 --> 00:33:44.963]  I've never done that before.
[00:33:45.003 --> 00:33:46.083]  It's fully funded for 2007.
[00:33:46.504 --> 00:33:49.566]  And on into 2008.
[00:33:50.867 --> 00:33:53.709]  We're openly saying that the President is above all laws.
[00:33:54.209 --> 00:33:56.771]  The Vice President is above the executive branch.
[00:33:57.872 --> 00:33:59.533]  He has autonomy from all.
[00:33:59.553 --> 00:34:03.056]  He is literally Vice Roy Governor of the New World Order.
[00:34:03.996 --> 00:34:06.138]  And we are entering the twilight zone.
[00:34:06.158 --> 00:34:10.481]  So I'm going to break all that down coming up here in just a few minutes and how it dovetails.
[00:34:10.821 --> 00:34:11.982]  Please call everyone you know.
[00:34:12.910 --> 00:34:17.691]  Because the information I'm going to be covering in about five minutes is of the utmost importance.
[00:34:20.672 --> 00:34:25.933]  Now I'd like to go to Luke Radowski, speaking of attacks on freedom.
[00:34:27.133 --> 00:34:32.054]  New York cops already come up to you and say you're not allowed to videotape and there has to be some imaginary permit.
[00:34:32.214 --> 00:34:34.375]  There is no law, there is no regulation, they just make it up.
[00:34:34.775 --> 00:34:36.995]  And the New York Times shows that, that they've been arresting people.
[00:34:37.455 --> 00:34:39.996]  I mean AP reporters, American Spectator reporters,
[00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:44.288]  UPI reporters, I've seen them arrest other reporters.
[00:34:44.308 --> 00:34:52.514]  A reporter can be in a suit, mainstream, and they just run up like goons, like literal pit bulls, and just say, all right, what are you doing here?
[00:34:52.534 --> 00:34:54.855]  And I mean, you can be in Central Park, and I'm a reporter.
[00:34:55.496 --> 00:34:57.137]  Hey, handcuffs, get them.
[00:34:57.237 --> 00:35:00.239]  I mean, it's just like, it's letting us know.
[00:35:00.459 --> 00:35:02.060]  They've been told to act like this, folks.
[00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:05.963]  And it's letting us know who the boss is.
[00:35:07.143 --> 00:35:10.587]  And all over the country, they're giving people felony arrests for videotaping the cops.
[00:35:11.147 --> 00:35:12.809]  Nine times out of ten, it gets thrown out of court.
[00:35:12.989 --> 00:35:17.694]  Hundreds of court cases saying it's illegal, it's a false arrest, official oppression, that it's First Amendment.
[00:35:17.975 --> 00:35:18.655]  They don't care.
[00:35:18.856 --> 00:35:20.738]  They've got our tax money to pay the suits off.
[00:35:21.098 --> 00:35:23.140]  They just go, hey, Mac, we don't care.
[00:35:24.221 --> 00:35:25.923]  Because they want to set the precedent.
[00:35:26.584 --> 00:35:29.487]  And Bloomberg, who owns his own media empire, one of the biggest in the world,
[00:35:30.735 --> 00:35:32.697]  Now wants to ban basically all photography.
[00:35:32.717 --> 00:35:37.420]  And I've actually got the city rules that they are now claiming they're going to try to put into effect.
[00:35:39.441 --> 00:35:40.943]  They had a secret comment period.
[00:35:40.983 --> 00:35:41.563]  No one was told.
[00:35:41.583 --> 00:35:45.726]  They had a meeting quote for public comment and said no one showed up because they never publicized it.
[00:35:46.206 --> 00:35:54.973]  And so Luke Rudowsky and WeAreChange.org and ReportersForInfoWars.com are going to be going down to Bloomberg's media offices for the city
[00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:56.550]  Thanks for having me.
[00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:37.199]  Thanks for having me, and again, that's today, 4 p.m., in front of the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater, and Broadcasting, at 116-97 Broadway, at the entrance of 53rd Street.
[00:36:37.479 --> 00:36:38.941]  And I hope everybody comes out.
[00:36:38.961 --> 00:36:41.224]  This is unpermitted because we don't need permits.
[00:36:41.265 --> 00:36:42.186]  We don't need permission.
[00:36:42.642 --> 00:36:43.483]  We're good.
[00:36:57.822 --> 00:37:00.643]  It will make filming illegal.
[00:37:01.284 --> 00:37:04.025]  What we do, our YouTube video, is not possible.
[00:37:04.045 --> 00:37:07.947]  And that's why we have to fight this, because this is a blatant attack on the First Amendment.
[00:37:07.967 --> 00:37:09.708]  A blatant attack on freedom of the press.
[00:37:09.908 --> 00:37:12.489]  And with this charity, they always put it into some procedure.
[00:37:12.849 --> 00:37:19.913]  Well, if you can jump through 20 flaming hoops and pay a million dollar insurance fee, then you can have a camera.
[00:37:19.933 --> 00:37:24.055]  And it says people, even with cameras in the satchels, tourist.
[00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:29.999]  Uh, are not allowed for more than 10 minutes to even be in line, or at the Empire State's building with cameras.
[00:37:30.379 --> 00:37:32.660]  It will all be selectively enforced.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:43.165]  And they admitted that when they've been arresting reporters and others, that they then tell them, well you gotta have a permit, and then major news agencies go to get a permit from New York, and they say we don't offer permits.
[00:37:43.605 --> 00:37:45.966]  It's kind of like what they did with the guns 30 years ago.
[00:37:45.986 --> 00:37:48.907]  They said, well, you've got to have a permit, and then they just don't offer them.
[00:37:49.007 --> 00:37:59.671]  When you go, they say there's no such permit, and literally the only permits in New York City for handguns are for people who give more than $30,000 to different campaigns of city council members.
[00:37:59.711 --> 00:38:05.813]  I mean, only mob bosses and rich people, and it's been in the news, are allowed to have guns.
[00:38:06.033 --> 00:38:07.174]  It's the same thing.
[00:38:08.454 --> 00:38:14.616]  Understand, folks, in America, they put cameras on us, they track us, the cops are out sneering, videotaping, and laughing.
[00:38:14.796 --> 00:38:15.356]  They have U.S.
[00:38:15.436 --> 00:38:17.376]  Army on the streets of New York that have videotaped us.
[00:38:17.596 --> 00:38:20.797]  I mean, regular army, laughing at us and cussing at us on tape.
[00:38:20.817 --> 00:38:23.698]  I have military, it's in the new film, screaming and cussing at us.
[00:38:24.038 --> 00:38:28.239]  Just running up from 20 feet away, cussing and saying, you're not allowed to videotape me.
[00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.220]  I mean, as if they're gods.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.941]  This is so they can have their way with the public in New York.
[00:38:36.508 --> 00:38:41.573]  We've already had New York police try to call YouTube and others and tell them to take videos down.
[00:38:42.274 --> 00:38:43.475]  They are afraid of us.
[00:38:43.636 --> 00:38:49.182]  In America, they're saying you can't videotape them.
[00:38:49.582 --> 00:38:51.444]  They want to do their crimes in the dark, Luke.
[00:38:52.216 --> 00:38:57.658]  The New York City Police Department puts up cameras every day on New York City corners, on New York City streets.
[00:38:57.939 --> 00:39:00.580]  The New York City Police Department has a camera in each police car.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:11.404]  The New York City Police Department, whenever there's a protest or demonstration, has a camera, has videographers, video recording the protesters, video recording anybody that's out there, anybody that's a leader.
[00:39:11.785 --> 00:39:14.826]  And we can't record them back now with Mayor Bloomberg's law.
[00:39:14.866 --> 00:39:15.506]  This is criminal.
[00:39:15.546 --> 00:39:18.588]  I mean, I can't understand how blamed these people could get.
[00:39:18.888 --> 00:39:21.209]  They could record us and we can't record them?
[00:39:21.569 --> 00:39:21.749]  I mean,
[00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.151]  And they still tell us.
[00:39:23.271 --> 00:39:26.452]  I mean, even right now, without this law, they tell us we can't record them.
[00:39:26.732 --> 00:39:31.214]  I mean, if you look at that one video when we had that police officer call us terrorists while recording them.
[00:39:31.595 --> 00:39:33.896]  I mean, think what would have happened if we had that law.
[00:39:33.916 --> 00:39:37.217]  We would have been thrown in jail for just recording this conversation.
[00:39:37.257 --> 00:39:40.199]  We probably would have been set up by the Sibberstein's goons.
[00:39:40.419 --> 00:39:44.681]  We probably would have been sent to jail if it wasn't for me keeping a camera on these guys.
[00:39:45.049 --> 00:39:46.749]  The camera keeps us safe.
[00:39:46.789 --> 00:39:47.690]  People don't understand that.
[00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:49.610]  The camera is the new weapon of the revolution.
[00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:51.830]  Let me explain how they're doing under jurisdiction.
[00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.091]  This isn't even a law.
[00:39:53.491 --> 00:40:00.612]  This is a policy of the New York Film and Media Department claiming you're under entertainment licenses.
[00:40:01.452 --> 00:40:04.373]  So again, you are news gathering, First Amendment.
[00:40:06.994 --> 00:40:08.234]  What's the term they use?
[00:40:08.934 --> 00:40:10.774]  The leftists always do it and it's very effective.
[00:40:11.034 --> 00:40:14.075]  Where they have a monitor there with a video camera
[00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:31.185]  wearing maybe an orange jacket that says you know free speech monitor or police monitor and then that's what you put them in an orange you know highway reflector outfit very clean sign needs to be professional looking that says police monitor
[00:40:31.947 --> 00:40:32.548]  I don't know.
[00:40:49.826 --> 00:40:51.908]  And they'll use that video in court.
[00:40:51.948 --> 00:40:55.610]  They'll go, look, I assaulted him and hurt my fist when I punched the slave.
[00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:57.291]  I mean, the scum citizen.
[00:40:57.932 --> 00:41:05.477]  And Luke, tell folks again how they come out there today, how they stand up for America, that our founding fathers literally fought and died for.
[00:41:05.777 --> 00:41:08.779]  They are attacking the heart of the country head on.
[00:41:08.799 --> 00:41:14.463]  I had Austin Goons trying to tell me I couldn't protest, I couldn't videotape just a few weeks ago.
[00:41:14.823 --> 00:41:16.724]  I told them, go ahead and arrest me, scum.
[00:41:16.744 --> 00:41:19.046]  And I called them degenerate scum.
[00:41:19.626 --> 00:41:23.867]  That was very nice until they started doing that, and I said, you will not kill America!
[00:41:24.187 --> 00:41:24.668]  Scum!
[00:41:24.708 --> 00:41:26.828]  You are degenerate scum!
[00:41:28.149 --> 00:41:38.131]  Yeah, man, we have to stand up, and if we don't protest out there, and we don't let them see how many people are opposed against us, why even, you know, resist it?
[00:41:38.171 --> 00:41:43.293]  We have to resist it by going out there in the streets and showing Mayor Bloomberg that we're not going to stand for this.
[00:41:43.832 --> 00:41:47.835]  And even if this law passes, I'll be the first one to break it in New York City.
[00:41:47.855 --> 00:41:49.116]  Well, it isn't a law, Luke.
[00:41:49.156 --> 00:41:50.537]  You need to make it clear on record.
[00:41:50.978 --> 00:41:51.878]  It's not even a law.
[00:41:51.978 --> 00:42:05.749]  It's just these bureaucracies, just like the Declaration of Independence said, that the king would just create all these new agents to go out and eat out our substance, and then they would just make rules as they went along.
[00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:09.452]  It's like Dick Cheney saying, I am above the law.
[00:42:09.812 --> 00:42:13.495]  I have executive privilege, but when I choose, I am outside the executive.
[00:42:15.089 --> 00:42:17.891]  Folks, you understand, folks, we are on the precipice.
[00:42:18.351 --> 00:42:19.512]  This is not a drill.
[00:42:19.792 --> 00:42:20.973]  This is not a game.
[00:42:21.253 --> 00:42:22.934]  They're doing it everywhere.
[00:42:23.054 --> 00:42:25.416]  The country is in critical.
[00:42:25.836 --> 00:42:28.198]  It's redlining right now.
[00:42:28.778 --> 00:42:34.762]  If we had the EKG on the country right now, you would literally have a flatline.
[00:42:35.022 --> 00:42:40.246]  We need to get paddles on the country's chest right now and defibrillate the heart now, folks.
[00:42:40.996 --> 00:42:44.577]  And again, this isn't natural death and natural heart disease of the country.
[00:42:45.017 --> 00:42:47.898]  This is like the country was electrocuted and it turned our heart off.
[00:42:48.238 --> 00:42:52.599]  We need to use that electricity to re-energize it with a bolt of lightning right to the heart.
[00:42:53.539 --> 00:42:57.480]  Luke, again, that's coming up in 3 hours and 15 minutes or so.
[00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:59.141]  People, be there right at the start.
[00:42:59.381 --> 00:43:02.122]  This isn't like a party where you're fashionably late.
[00:43:03.102 --> 00:43:05.263]  You need to get out there now.
[00:43:05.543 --> 00:43:06.643]  Tell folks where it is, Luke.
[00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:13.166]  It's on 1697 Broadway at the entrance of 53rd Street.
[00:43:13.386 --> 00:43:15.548]  But we can't let these criminals get away with this.
[00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:19.150]  The protest information and the address is located on We Are Change.
[00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:21.171]  Again, 4 o'clock at 1697 Broadway.
[00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.772]  697 Broadway at the entrance of 53rd Street.
[00:43:25.093 --> 00:43:26.193]  They're here in New York City.
[00:43:26.233 --> 00:43:30.317]  Now Luke, Luke, I know you like to edit nice little pieces and put music on and stuff.
[00:43:30.657 --> 00:43:35.080]  Can't you just tonight run in there with the raw footage, take 20 minutes, throw it on Google?
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:37.602]  I mean, because we need to get this out as soon as possible.
[00:43:38.450 --> 00:43:40.291]  Because this is going to draw major attention.
[00:43:40.331 --> 00:43:40.791]  You watch.
[00:43:41.171 --> 00:43:44.513]  You're going to have a nice run-in with the goons as usual and we need to show people.
[00:43:44.833 --> 00:43:49.395]  There you are demonstrating for the freedom of the press and free speech and showing the goons.
[00:43:49.635 --> 00:43:51.376]  We'll get an article out on it by tomorrow.
[00:43:51.596 --> 00:44:01.160]  It'll be huge news and that may be able then to get enough attention in mainstream media to shame the scumbag criminal mayor into backing off.
[00:44:02.259 --> 00:44:13.324]  I hope he does back off, and I hope a lot of people do show up today and send them a message that these criminals, they're not Americans, they're not patriots, these criminals, scum, will not get away with destroying our freedoms.
[00:44:13.464 --> 00:44:15.685]  And again, they are scum!
[00:44:16.145 --> 00:44:17.506]  Again, we're Americans!
[00:44:17.886 --> 00:44:18.286]  Okay?
[00:44:18.406 --> 00:44:21.948]  They're coming directly for our basic freedoms now!
[00:44:22.308 --> 00:44:28.651]  If you think the Second Amendment, if you think the Tenth Amendment, if you think any of this is going to stand, when they're doing things like this, you've got another thing coming.
[00:44:29.111 --> 00:44:33.436]  Folks, they are attacking the Bill of Rights, systematically driving it into the ground.
[00:44:33.636 --> 00:44:38.141]  They passed massive gun control three weeks ago, the biggest since the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[00:44:38.342 --> 00:44:39.643]  The average person doesn't even know.
[00:44:39.923 --> 00:44:43.688]  We, by the narrowest of margins, defeated amnesty for now.
[00:44:44.631 --> 00:44:45.732]  Which is a holding action.
[00:44:45.772 --> 00:44:47.754]  They swear they're coming back in the next few months.
[00:44:48.154 --> 00:44:54.940]  We are in tooth and nail, front line, last ditch, fixed bayonets, trench warfare, folks.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.361]  We have been overrun.
[00:44:56.602 --> 00:44:59.144]  We are fighting to the death here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:00.101 --> 00:45:03.403]  And you know, we're fighting 100 to 1 because so many of you won't get involved in the fight.
[00:45:03.723 --> 00:45:06.424]  You know what's going on, but you've decided to sit there and be a spectator.
[00:45:07.044 --> 00:45:08.305]  You cannot be a spectator.
[00:45:08.325 --> 00:45:09.325]  There are no bleachers.
[00:45:09.605 --> 00:45:11.846]  You are all in the road, on the field, with us.
[00:45:12.226 --> 00:45:16.128]  Whether you like it or not, you're going to be run over by this system, or you're going to stand up against it.
[00:45:16.348 --> 00:45:20.530]  And I know if somebody's going to come against me, I'm going to at least go head up against them.
[00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:23.571]  Luke, bottom line, people need to be there today!
[00:45:24.386 --> 00:45:26.967]  You need to be there, you need to stand up, and you need to dissent.
[00:45:28.288 --> 00:45:29.048]  Don't consent.
[00:45:29.408 --> 00:45:29.908]  Dissent.
[00:45:30.169 --> 00:45:31.309]  Don't consent with the system.
[00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:32.950]  Don't allow Bloomberg to do this.
[00:45:33.050 --> 00:45:33.470]  Be there.
[00:45:33.810 --> 00:45:35.211]  Show him you mean business.
[00:45:35.471 --> 00:45:38.432]  Show him you're there, and your role is to stand up for America.
[00:45:38.472 --> 00:45:42.054]  Your role is to stand up for the First Amendment, for the Second Amendment, and for all the amendments.
[00:45:42.314 --> 00:45:47.556]  And tell him that you're American, and he's scum, and we have to be out there, and I hope to see everybody out there at 4 o'clock today.
[00:45:48.457 --> 00:45:53.739]  Absolutely, and I keep telling my web guys to put a link all weekend up to the site
[00:45:54.324 --> 00:45:56.026]  I'm telling people, this is the time to act.
[00:45:56.046 --> 00:45:56.867]  If you don't act now,
[00:46:13.925 --> 00:46:16.067]  You know, there's nothing to save.
[00:46:16.207 --> 00:46:17.789]  I mean, we have to take this country back.
[00:46:17.849 --> 00:46:25.075]  There's criminals within our government, there's criminals outside our government trying to destroy everything this country stands for, trying to destroy the Bill of Rights.
[00:46:25.396 --> 00:46:31.441]  And unless we stand up, unless we get involved, unless we get active, we are going to take this country back.
[00:46:31.481 --> 00:46:32.862]  We have to get involved.
[00:46:33.163 --> 00:46:34.584]  We have to get educated first.
[00:46:35.066 --> 00:46:39.309]  When you're educated, when you have that education, that education is pointless unless we use it.
[00:46:39.609 --> 00:46:40.669]  So let's start using it.
[00:46:40.949 --> 00:46:46.353]  I've been doing this for about three and a half to four years and I'm telling you, I feel so good, so gratified doing this.
[00:46:46.693 --> 00:46:48.694]  It feels so good just reaching out to somebody.
[00:46:48.974 --> 00:46:49.494]  It's simple.
[00:46:49.695 --> 00:46:50.635]  It's not even that hard.
[00:46:50.895 --> 00:46:52.016]  Just reach out to somebody.
[00:46:52.336 --> 00:46:53.137]  Give him a DVD.
[00:46:53.457 --> 00:46:54.298]  Talk to him about 9-11.
[00:46:54.318 --> 00:46:56.200]  Talk to him about some of the evidence.
[00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:57.521]  Talk to him about Building 7.
[00:46:57.621 --> 00:46:58.161]  Absolutely.
[00:46:58.201 --> 00:46:59.302]  We gotta get aggressive.
[00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:01.004]  Listen to this Patrick Henry quote.
[00:47:01.604 --> 00:47:09.972]  Are we at last brought to such humiliating and debasing degradation that we cannot be trusted with arms for our defense?
[00:47:10.472 --> 00:47:15.517]  That's what they were confiscating the guns in 1775 before the thumping started of the British.
[00:47:16.371 --> 00:47:17.052]  And it continues.
[00:47:17.112 --> 00:47:17.732]  Here's another one.
[00:47:17.772 --> 00:47:18.834]  I know not what course.
[00:47:18.854 --> 00:47:20.395]  I think these are all broken down into shorter ones.
[00:47:20.435 --> 00:47:20.635]  Yeah.
[00:47:20.976 --> 00:47:25.440]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:47:26.822 --> 00:47:28.783]  These are all the little short broken up quotes.
[00:47:29.264 --> 00:47:32.968]  I'm going to try to find the big quote here.
[00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:34.229]  Keep going.
[00:47:34.878 --> 00:47:40.984]  Yeah, another thing I wanted to say is I hope to see everybody in New York City this anniversary of Not 1107.
[00:47:41.645 --> 00:47:47.791]  This weekend, we're going to be doing a weekend of five-day events here in New York City, full of street actions everywhere.
[00:47:47.811 --> 00:47:51.354]  And we're going to do the same thing we did last year, and that's take over Ground Zero.
[00:47:51.694 --> 00:47:53.356]  Give out hundreds of thousands
[00:47:53.763 --> 00:47:56.424]  of DVDs, talk to people, educate people.
[00:47:56.444 --> 00:47:59.124]  That's right, take this by Bloomberg as a challenge.
[00:47:59.484 --> 00:48:06.666]  I want everybody who maybe made a hundred copies of Loose Change 2nd Edition or Terror Storm or whatever a year ago, make another hundred copies.
[00:48:06.766 --> 00:48:07.927]  Get aggressive.
[00:48:08.107 --> 00:48:09.967]  Put bumper stickers all over your cars.
[00:48:10.327 --> 00:48:11.687]  Get aggressive, folks.
[00:48:11.787 --> 00:48:15.788]  Don't... They're afraid and they know that we're coming at them.
[00:48:16.029 --> 00:48:21.790]  And they know that their arrogance and their aplomb and their chutzpah and their bravado and their macho
[00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:23.912]  Bologna isn't working anymore.
[00:48:24.272 --> 00:48:25.494]  Look, God bless you.
[00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:26.855]  We'll be praying for you folks.
[00:48:26.935 --> 00:48:30.960]  Join him out there at four o'clock, three hours from now, there in New York City.
[00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.021]  Take care my friend.
[00:48:33.542 --> 00:48:34.183]  You bet my friend.
[00:48:35.725 --> 00:48:38.688]  It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.
[00:48:39.725 --> 00:48:43.169]  Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace.
[00:48:43.769 --> 00:48:45.411]  The war has actually begun.
[00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:51.397]  The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms.
[00:48:51.858 --> 00:48:53.780]  Our brethren are already in the field.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.442]  Why stand we here idle?
[00:48:57.003 --> 00:48:58.665]  What is it that gentlemen wish?
[00:48:59.821 --> 00:49:07.643]  What would they have, as life so dear or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?
[00:49:08.083 --> 00:49:10.184]  Forbid it, almighty God!
[00:49:10.784 --> 00:49:19.406]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me death!
[00:49:20.566 --> 00:49:20.846]  March 23rd, 1775.
[00:49:25.515 --> 00:49:26.396]  I'm going to read that again.
[00:49:26.616 --> 00:49:30.039]  It is vain, sir, to extenuate the matter.
[00:49:30.459 --> 00:49:33.962]  Gentlemen may cry, peace, peace, but there is no peace!
[00:49:34.162 --> 00:49:35.523]  They're attacking us!
[00:49:35.763 --> 00:49:37.125]  We're under attack!
[00:49:38.326 --> 00:49:38.966]  I added that.
[00:49:40.007 --> 00:49:41.788]  The war has actually begun.
[00:49:42.489 --> 00:49:48.014]  The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms.
[00:49:48.594 --> 00:49:50.456]  Our brethren are already in the field.
[00:49:50.956 --> 00:49:52.577]  Why stand we here idle?
[00:49:52.978 --> 00:49:54.419]  What is it that gentlemen wish?
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.360]  What would they have?
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:03.122]  Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of change and slavery?
[00:50:03.142 --> 00:50:06.583]  Now see, an American today is so spoiled they don't know what change and slavery are.
[00:50:06.883 --> 00:50:12.224]  They knew back then, folks, it's not fun to be purchased at the price of change and slavery.
[00:50:12.664 --> 00:50:14.044]  Forbid it, Almighty God!
[00:50:14.584 --> 00:50:19.565]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:50:20.826 --> 00:50:22.226]  I want to find the full quote
[00:50:23.433 --> 00:50:25.735]  Because he talks about we can hear the chains clinking.
[00:50:27.836 --> 00:50:28.777]  Where's that full quote?
[00:50:28.797 --> 00:50:30.618]  This is driving me completely up the wall.
[00:50:37.963 --> 00:50:40.265]  Guard with jealous attention the public liberty.
[00:50:40.945 --> 00:50:43.867]  Suspect everyone who approaches that jewel.
[00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:49.171]  Unfortunately nothing will preserve it but downright force.
[00:50:49.972 --> 00:50:52.774]  Whenever you give up that force, you're ruined.
[00:50:52.974 --> 00:51:01.639]  Oh sir, we should have fine times indeed, if to punish tyrants it were only sufficient to assemble the people.
[00:51:04.841 --> 00:51:10.345]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.705 --> 00:51:18.350]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.031 --> 00:51:26.095]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.495 --> 00:51:37.921]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.221 --> 00:51:41.923]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:44.144]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.464 --> 00:51:48.306]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.959 --> 00:52:05.521]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:52:05.561 --> 00:52:06.081]  are located?
[00:52:06.281 --> 00:52:09.663]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:53:01.576 --> 00:53:03.297]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:03.517 --> 00:53:07.219]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been murderized.
[00:53:07.539 --> 00:53:09.761]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:10.281 --> 00:53:16.484]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:16.644 --> 00:53:21.507]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:21.727 --> 00:53:30.751]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[00:54:02.693 --> 00:54:06.936]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex
[00:54:08.507 --> 00:54:10.849]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:10.869 --> 00:54:19.354]  I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience.
[00:54:20.234 --> 00:54:24.317]  I know of no way of judging the future, but by the past.
[00:54:25.538 --> 00:54:27.419]  Unbelievable quotes from Patrick Henry.
[00:54:27.459 --> 00:54:28.340]  I'm here just reading them.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.822]  You know what I meant yesterday to read a bunch of New World Order quotes?
[00:54:31.922 --> 00:54:33.543]  I'm going to read those in the third hour today.
[00:54:35.556 --> 00:54:47.283]  And I had David Bay and his filmmaker for Riddles in Stone, Mr. Pinto, coming on, but I'm going to reschedule them because of all this terror news and all the things we're facing because I do want to take your calls and we've got loaded lines.
[00:54:48.283 --> 00:54:54.347]  So we'll just, if it's alright with him, we'll just reschedule those guys until Friday or Thursday or something.
[00:54:56.068 --> 00:55:04.653]  I do want to, in the third hour, I do want to read Founding Father quotes versus quotes by the New World Order.
[00:55:06.443 --> 00:55:07.404]  So you can get the idea.
[00:55:07.945 --> 00:55:10.547]  I mean, they openly talk about killing you, enslaving you.
[00:55:12.369 --> 00:55:16.073]  They talk of you with disdain, how they want to destroy liberty, and man, they're doing it!
[00:55:16.674 --> 00:55:19.277]  And they got all these idiots that work for them, who love power.
[00:55:22.581 --> 00:55:28.943]  I'm going to start the next hour for about 10 minutes and get into the summer of spectacular terror, the federal fear-mongering.
[00:55:29.023 --> 00:55:30.064]  Are they getting ready to move?
[00:55:30.644 --> 00:55:32.805]  Is this the kickoff of the war with Iran?
[00:55:32.865 --> 00:55:34.025]  This is very serious.
[00:55:34.486 --> 00:55:36.066]  Their approval ratings are in free fall.
[00:55:36.146 --> 00:55:38.547]  We are... This is a very dangerous time.
[00:55:38.567 --> 00:55:41.408]  Another crossroads that we're passing right now.
[00:55:42.288 --> 00:55:44.229]  We're at a key juncture.
[00:55:44.249 --> 00:55:45.910]  And then I'm going to open the phones up.
[00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:49.171]  And then in the third hour, I'm going to spend much of that hour with quotes.
[00:55:50.011 --> 00:55:50.972]  Because they need to be heard.
[00:55:51.012 --> 00:55:51.692]  They need to be seen.
[00:55:56.392 --> 00:56:04.599]  I do want to encourage everyone to realize that in the fight against the New World Order, shows like this need your support.
[00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:14.688]  The way you support us is by getting my documentary films and the other books and videos that other great researchers and filmmakers have produced at InfoWars.com.
[00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:19.473]  Go peruse the video and bookstore on the Secure Online Shopping Cart or
[00:56:21.033 --> 00:56:21.733]  Call toll free.
[00:56:21.773 --> 00:56:26.154]  They can answer your questions about different titles, different films, different combo packs and specials.
[00:56:26.194 --> 00:56:32.476]  We have some of my films like American Dictators as low as $5.95 a piece, American Freedom to Fascism as low as $9.95.
[00:56:32.876 --> 00:56:37.017]  You can get Terrorist Farm as low as $9.95 when you get them in a combo together.
[00:56:37.597 --> 00:56:40.758]  You can get my Police State Trilogy for 45% off all three films for $34.95.
[00:56:44.264 --> 00:56:50.926]  All available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:56:50.946 --> 00:56:58.429]  And that's how you fund us here on our operation against the New World Order as well.
[00:56:58.449 --> 00:57:00.090]  888-253-3139.
[00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:06.052]  But the real reason is these videos will inform you to a higher level and you can give them to other people when you're done watching them.
[00:57:06.712 --> 00:57:09.173]  Or, do the best thing, make copies of them.
[00:57:10.293 --> 00:57:12.414]  You see, that's our main goal here is getting the word out.
[00:57:13.251 --> 00:57:28.337]  We're on a mission, and I'm asking you to make copies of my documentaries of Terror Storm, of Road to Tyranny, of The Order of Death, of the Police State films, and to get them out to people, and to get them out to people right now.
[00:57:29.398 --> 00:57:37.241]  I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart to take action, and to take action now in the fight against the Globalist.
[00:57:38.282 --> 00:57:38.682]  Please.
[00:57:40.683 --> 00:57:45.568]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:46.169 --> 00:57:50.934]  You don't have to wait, though, to call and order the DVDs or go on the phone if you wish.
[00:57:50.954 --> 00:57:55.498]  If you have a PrisonPlanet.tv membership, they're in really high quality for download.
[00:57:55.558 --> 00:57:56.579]  I mean, it's really crisp.
[00:57:57.340 --> 00:58:01.685]  You can burn them to disc or DVD and they just look almost as good as regular DVD.
[00:58:02.994 --> 00:58:07.317]  Especially the last six months or so, we've really gotten good at the quality of uploading them.
[00:58:07.698 --> 00:58:12.681]  We're going to re-encode some of the older stuff, because Prison Planet's now over three years old?
[00:58:12.741 --> 00:58:13.401]  That's incredible.
[00:58:14.862 --> 00:58:15.663]  Man, that's amazing.
[00:58:15.703 --> 00:58:16.484]  Is it two or three years?
[00:58:16.504 --> 00:58:18.845]  I think it's three.
[00:58:19.906 --> 00:58:21.967]  But side issue, PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:58:21.987 --> 00:58:22.267]  It is a
[00:58:26.614 --> 00:58:28.075]  Armory in the Info War.
[00:58:28.295 --> 00:58:37.900]  Just info weapons on every subject waiting for you to access the armory and begin the Info War in your sector.
[00:58:41.402 --> 00:58:46.045]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.609 --> 00:58:58.270]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.930 --> 00:58:59.971]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.691 --> 00:59:01.812]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.452 --> 00:59:03.273]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.033 --> 00:59:04.954]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.594 --> 00:59:09.256]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.777 --> 00:59:13.899]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.902 --> 00:59:26.467]  Every time I read passages by Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine, particularly those two men, it just strikes my heart.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:44.443]  At the foresight, the precision, the acuity, the sharpness at which they just say it in so few words, Patrick Henry quote, the great object is that every man be armed.
[00:59:44.943 --> 00:59:53.625]  The great object, that is the object, that is the grail, the heart of the matter, because then tyranny
[00:59:54.392 --> 00:59:59.254]  Literally, cannot thrive, cannot even live, cannot even exist.
[01:00:03.675 --> 01:00:07.336]  Absolutely amazing from Patrick Henry.
[01:00:07.356 --> 01:00:08.476]  There's some other quotes.
[01:00:09.197 --> 01:00:12.037]  We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth.
[01:00:12.598 --> 01:00:17.279]  For my part, I am willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.
[01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:19.620]  There's another one.
[01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.160]  The great object of this is that every man be armed.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:23.961]  Everyone who is able may have a gun.
[01:00:25.562 --> 01:00:31.547]  They had that University of Chicago professor put out that lie claiming no one owned guns in America was anti-gun.
[01:00:32.848 --> 01:00:34.409]  It was just all fabrications.
[01:00:34.949 --> 01:00:36.551]  It turned out he did it because he's anti-gun.
[01:00:36.611 --> 01:00:37.411]  Just a bunch of crooks.
[01:00:39.953 --> 01:00:41.014]  Trying to steal our liberty.
[01:00:43.696 --> 01:00:45.217]  Look at these quotes, they're so beautiful.
[01:00:46.578 --> 01:00:47.579]  I love this one up here.
[01:00:47.599 --> 01:00:53.844]  About when they try to take freedom, when they approach the jewel
[01:00:54.691 --> 01:00:55.912]  Rise up and crush them.
[01:00:56.573 --> 01:00:57.734]  There are several different quotes here.
[01:00:57.754 --> 01:00:58.815]  I'm looking at hundreds of them.
[01:00:58.835 --> 01:01:01.277]  I'm trying to find that one about the jewel.
[01:01:03.179 --> 01:01:09.405]  Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of change and slavery?
[01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:11.227]  Forbid it, Almighty God.
[01:01:11.247 --> 01:01:15.451]  I know not what course others may take, but as for me,
[01:01:16.357 --> 01:01:18.197]  Give me liberty or give me death.
[01:01:18.277 --> 01:01:20.038]  That is such a liberating statement.
[01:01:20.538 --> 01:01:22.418]  And to truly commit to that is liberating.
[01:01:22.438 --> 01:01:23.619]  You're not really alive, folks.
[01:01:23.639 --> 01:01:24.859]  Do you try to stand in the light?
[01:01:24.879 --> 01:01:26.239]  At least try.
[01:01:26.259 --> 01:01:27.480]  It doesn't mean any of us are perfect.
[01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.780]  And just say, I'm not afraid.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:31.081]  I'm going to head up against you.
[01:01:34.401 --> 01:01:36.022]  Virtue, morality, and religion.
[01:01:36.522 --> 01:01:38.022]  This is the armor, my friend.
[01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:41.143]  And this alone that renders us invincible.
[01:01:44.085 --> 01:01:46.026]  These are the tactics we should study.
[01:01:46.287 --> 01:01:48.028]  If we lose these, we are conquered.
[01:01:48.428 --> 01:01:49.309]  Fallen indeed!
[01:01:49.869 --> 01:01:53.892]  So long as our manners and principles remain sound, there is no danger.
[01:01:54.432 --> 01:01:55.813]  The New World Order knows that, folks.
[01:01:55.833 --> 01:02:09.883]  That's why they try to turn us into a bunch of gibbering, petty fools chasing after baubles and trinkets and logos of power instead of the true power of good and righteousness that beats in all of our hearts if we ask God in.
[01:02:10.959 --> 01:02:14.060]  That's something I just said, but the point is it's true what he's saying.
[01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:17.881]  That is the treasures, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:22.743]  The good you've done, the people you love, working for your family.
[01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:24.803]  And again, I'm not up here on some high horse.
[01:02:25.003 --> 01:02:25.884]  I've got a lot of problems.
[01:02:25.964 --> 01:02:33.606]  I'm trying to be a good person, and I'm trying to be a moral person, and I'm trying my best, and I have a desire
[01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:46.732]  If you don't have that desire in you to fight evil in yourself and in the world and to be a good person and to help people, and if it doesn't feel good to you to help the infirm, if it doesn't feel good to you to love your wife and love your family.
[01:02:46.752 --> 01:02:58.415]  I mean, my God, I was just sitting in the backyard with the green grass and butterflies flying around and flowers and the blue sky and I was just like, the wonder of life, just everything around us.
[01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:04.342]  The design and beauty of a monarch butterfly.
[01:03:07.765 --> 01:03:10.767]  Just looking at it and just thinking about everything that went into it.
[01:03:14.770 --> 01:03:16.371]  The delicateness, all of it.
[01:03:17.352 --> 01:03:24.617]  We've got a bunch of goons in black uniforms stomping around, bossing us around to keep us safe from the terrorists.
[01:03:30.871 --> 01:03:34.574]  When we get back, I'll give you a brief synopsis of the Summer of Terror.
[01:03:34.614 --> 01:03:35.795]  The Feds are promising us.
[01:03:36.275 --> 01:03:37.476]  Are they making their move?
[01:03:38.277 --> 01:03:38.617]  Yes.
[01:03:39.698 --> 01:03:48.744]  In my heart, I'm now sure that unless we put out the full effort now, as we did last year, they are going to hit us and hit us hard.
[01:03:49.545 --> 01:03:50.766]  They could hit us within the week.
[01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:51.967]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:56.341 --> 01:04:01.849]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:09.821]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:10.532 --> 01:04:17.596]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:17.996 --> 01:04:29.422]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.722 --> 01:04:33.384]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:33.685 --> 01:04:35.646]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:35.966 --> 01:04:39.808]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:53.166 --> 01:04:53.947]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.087 --> 01:04:54.828]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.928 --> 01:05:01.015]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:01.255 --> 01:05:02.857]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:03.097 --> 01:05:05.580]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.961 --> 01:05:12.568]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[01:05:12.568 --> 01:05:13.669]  We're good to go.

[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.301]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[01:05:55.741 --> 01:05:56.021]  Look!
[01:05:56.422 --> 01:05:57.482]  Up there in the sky!
[01:05:57.902 --> 01:05:59.203]  It's Non-X-Man!
[01:05:59.603 --> 01:06:00.764]  He's in a dive!
[01:06:01.064 --> 01:06:03.065]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[01:06:03.365 --> 01:06:04.126]  Let's go look!
[01:06:06.347 --> 01:06:09.529]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[01:06:09.949 --> 01:06:11.290]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[01:06:11.490 --> 01:06:11.930]  Take them out!
[01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:13.252]  Let's see.
[01:06:13.272 --> 01:06:17.853]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:06:18.193 --> 01:06:18.653]  Don't worry.
[01:06:19.113 --> 01:06:20.614]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:21.254 --> 01:06:25.675]  Use it on your toenails regularly, and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:06:26.195 --> 01:06:28.275]  Oh, I will, Non-X Man.
[01:06:28.395 --> 01:06:31.136]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:06:33.236 --> 01:06:35.877]  Don't let Non-X Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:06:36.357 --> 01:06:39.837]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed, Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:06:40.338 --> 01:06:42.038]  It's in the foot care aisle at Supercenters.
[01:06:46.873 --> 01:07:00.499]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:04.161]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.841 --> 01:07:05.822]  We are live.
[01:07:05.842 --> 01:07:10.844]  It is the second day of July 2007 and as we approach the
[01:07:12.114 --> 01:07:14.336]  Birthday of our country, what will it be?
[01:07:14.356 --> 01:07:15.917]  232 years old.
[01:07:17.338 --> 01:07:23.122]  The New World Order is moving with every savage invention of wicked tyranny they can.
[01:07:23.142 --> 01:07:30.147]  Their siege engines are assailing our walls, tearing down the final blocks of freedom, but
[01:07:30.808 --> 01:07:32.529]  We do hear the trumpet and the cavalry.
[01:07:32.669 --> 01:07:38.371]  Their assault has woken and awoken the sleeping giant that is America.
[01:07:38.791 --> 01:07:40.412]  And the people are waking up.
[01:07:40.472 --> 01:07:42.472]  And so the enemy is screaming out against us.
[01:07:42.873 --> 01:07:48.255]  Saying we want to shut down free speech on the internet, talk radio, videotaping, police having cameras.
[01:07:49.435 --> 01:07:52.236]  Just absolute assault.
[01:07:52.816 --> 01:07:53.997]  It is not going to work.
[01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:57.258]  You're just showing everyone who and what you are.
[01:08:01.818 --> 01:08:02.198]  All right.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.943]  These events in England are opportunistic.
[01:08:06.963 --> 01:08:19.854]  They come at a perfect time for Gordon Brown as massive resistance mounts against him, forcing England to join the EU when now over 90 percent, a few weeks ago I was saying 80 plus, now it's over 90 percent in major multiple polls.
[01:08:21.015 --> 01:08:26.620]  Now the people are really mad because they weren't able to vote on it and Brown's just doing it with Blair's final action.
[01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:32.142]  Merging them under the EU control, something the EU, when they got a vote two years ago, said no to.
[01:08:32.623 --> 01:08:40.450]  The member countries said no, but the bureaucracy promising Blair big jobs is bringing him in later to be the head of the EU.
[01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:42.752]  That's why he's converted over to Catholicism last week.
[01:08:43.903 --> 01:08:48.025]  His last day in office meeting with the Pope, Ratzinger, Benedict.
[01:08:48.745 --> 01:08:50.826]  So, this is serious.
[01:08:51.746 --> 01:08:56.087]  And last week, I've got the BBC article right here, Gordon Brown, Mr. New World Order.
[01:08:56.107 --> 01:08:58.928]  I mean, this guy's worse than Blair, if that's possible.
[01:08:59.089 --> 01:08:59.929]  Many times worse.
[01:09:00.989 --> 01:09:03.410]  And he just radiates evil, not just his actions.
[01:09:04.611 --> 01:09:08.592]  Few of them have that shark eye look, that great white look, and he's got it.
[01:09:09.719 --> 01:09:12.442]  The Stygian depths of hell literally glare back from his eyes.
[01:09:12.502 --> 01:09:15.025]  But side issue, Gordon Brown means business.
[01:09:15.846 --> 01:09:20.751]  And he comes in and just magically these events start happening.
[01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:22.733]  Just magically.
[01:09:24.855 --> 01:09:27.018]  And then they issue the challenge to the British people.
[01:09:27.158 --> 01:09:29.060]  Do you have the courage?
[01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:32.584]  Or will you allow these Al-Qaeda attacks
[01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:49.582]  to make you cowardly tell the British government to pull out of the Iraq war or will you have the British stiff upper lip and the British Sheffield steel you're known for and will you rally when Britannia is under the blitz?
[01:09:52.883 --> 01:09:53.823]  That's what they've said.
[01:09:53.843 --> 01:09:55.784]  That's what they've done.
[01:09:58.374 --> 01:09:59.855]  Total reverse psychology.
[01:09:59.935 --> 01:10:02.437]  Brown's approval rating just came out today.
[01:10:02.838 --> 01:10:05.339]  Went up a full 10 points.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.823]  He came in unelected as the replacement for the resigning Blair.
[01:10:11.395 --> 01:10:31.669]  And elections are coming up, they're going to set in the next few years, and just magically this happens and his ratings go up, they rally behind him, and of course the majority of the British people we've talked to and gotten emails from know it's pure bull, know it's a stage deal, but all the old ladies they show on the news going, well we'll carry on like Britannians always do.
[01:10:33.550 --> 01:10:34.391]  You know, with that cliché.
[01:10:35.612 --> 01:10:39.175]  Step up and lay up in the face of a fiery holocaust.
[01:10:39.575 --> 01:10:41.476]  Thousands could have died.
[01:10:42.177 --> 01:10:47.000]  And then we hear in the media that they never heard of a plan.
[01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:48.541]  They never knew there was anything going on.
[01:10:48.561 --> 01:10:51.043]  What happens is, there's good people in Scotland Yard.
[01:10:51.083 --> 01:10:52.964]  There's good people in MI6 and MI5.
[01:10:53.244 --> 01:10:54.945]  There's good people in local police departments.
[01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:56.526]  They heard about the preparations of this.
[01:10:56.907 --> 01:10:59.609]  So the warnings of a month ago first came out in England.
[01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.330]  Yeah, we're hearing there's plans to attack nightclubs.
[01:11:02.711 --> 01:11:03.131]  Look out.
[01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:09.770]  That's because there's a lot of good cops that say, and this is happening in every case, just like in 9-11, hey, I'm not going along with this.
[01:11:10.331 --> 01:11:15.757]  And they start warning people unofficially, then they officially have to come out and say, okay, yes, there's a threat.
[01:11:17.639 --> 01:11:22.084]  Then they go out and provocateur these patsies to talk about
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:41.410]  From their Caribbean homes, with no logistics, no bombs, no nothing, with informants leading the groups to talk about blowing up JFK, blowing up fuel lines, driving vehicles into them, planting bombs on them, and then all the experts look at it and go, well, that'd cause a big fire, but probably wouldn't even kill anybody.
[01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:44.411]  Because that's not how gasoline burns or explodes.
[01:11:44.431 --> 01:11:51.035]  I mean, they have whole refineries blow up and, you know, they keep the personnel about 100 yards away and generally they don't even die.
[01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:57.330]  They blow up in Houston or Corpus Christi or, you know, Louisiana or Mississippi.
[01:11:57.350 --> 01:12:02.951]  I mean, those things are hundreds of times bigger than JFK fueling terminals.
[01:12:02.991 --> 01:12:09.693]  Plus, gasoline and petrochemicals they're mixing are highly explosive compared to kerosene, which is jet fuel.
[01:12:09.713 --> 01:12:12.114]  People think of jet fuel as, wow, that must be explosive.
[01:12:12.794 --> 01:12:21.117]  No, it's, you can, don't try it, because every once in a while it might detonate, but they've done the test where you take a full vat of jet fuel and stick lit matches in it.
[01:12:22.131 --> 01:12:23.372]  Unless you aerosolize it.
[01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:30.317]  You could take jet fuel in your mouth and spit it out into a blip match and it might ignite.
[01:12:30.797 --> 01:12:34.299]  It's got to be aerosolized in an oxygen-rich environment.
[01:12:34.439 --> 01:12:36.761]  But I'm digressing here.
[01:12:37.541 --> 01:12:39.022]  And please don't put kerosene in your mouth.
[01:12:39.102 --> 01:12:40.363]  It tastes horrible and is poisonous.
[01:12:40.403 --> 01:12:42.244]  My point is, you'd have to aerosolize it.
[01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:49.009]  You know, like somebody taking Bacardi 2929 or whatever it's called and spitting it out.
[01:12:50.928 --> 01:12:54.050]  You can't get it to light with a match unless you aerosolize it.
[01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:56.751]  But I'm just trying to use real-world examples here.
[01:12:56.792 --> 01:12:57.792]  It's just basic science.
[01:13:00.234 --> 01:13:02.615]  So that's the backdrop of what's going on.
[01:13:03.075 --> 01:13:05.977]  And then, this is ABC News last night.
[01:13:08.318 --> 01:13:09.439]  Secret documents!
[01:13:09.679 --> 01:13:09.959]  U.S.
[01:13:10.019 --> 01:13:11.780]  Fears Terrorist Spectacular Plan.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:16.123]  I remember before the 2004 election, they used ABC and the Christian Science Monitor
[01:13:17.057 --> 01:13:17.918]  Which I have U.S.
[01:13:17.938 --> 01:13:22.781]  government documents from the 60s saying those are basically CIA-run front companies.
[01:13:22.801 --> 01:13:26.743]  That's where they put out their disinfos, Christian Science Monitor, U.S.
[01:13:26.783 --> 01:13:28.884]  News & World Report, ABC News.
[01:13:29.465 --> 01:13:30.485]  Secret document, U.S.
[01:13:30.545 --> 01:13:32.446]  Fears Terror Spectacular Plan.
[01:13:32.887 --> 01:13:36.229]  Official cites resemblance to warnings and intelligence before 9-11.
[01:13:37.992 --> 01:13:40.835]  So they're saying, oh, we got the same chatter before 9-11.
[01:13:41.616 --> 01:13:46.661]  You mean where you ordered FBI agents in Dallas, Phoenix, Oklahoma City, Minneapolis, St.
[01:13:46.701 --> 01:13:56.532]  Paul, Chicago, New York, San Diego, San Francisco to stand down with your patsies running around creating their ledger, their history?
[01:13:56.672 --> 01:13:57.553]  You mean then?
[01:14:00.390 --> 01:14:06.435]  And now they got cops all over the place running around jabbing and poking and yelling at people to keep us safe, of course.
[01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:07.916]  It's all for our own good.
[01:14:08.396 --> 01:14:09.217]  A secret U.S.
[01:14:09.257 --> 01:14:19.565]  law enforcement report prepared for the Department of Homeland Security warns that an al-Qaeda is planning a terrorist spectacular this summer, according to a senior official with access to the document.
[01:14:20.086 --> 01:14:25.450]  This is reminiscent of the warnings and intelligence we were getting in the summer of 2001, the official told ABC News.
[01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:27.712]  I thought you never heard of any plan that was out of the blue.
[01:14:29.082 --> 01:14:29.322]  U.S.
[01:14:29.362 --> 01:14:46.486]  officials have kept the information secret and Homeland Security Secretary and known Mossad agent, I added that part, Michael Chertoff said today on ABC News that this weekend that George Devinopoulos, that the United States did not have any specific credible evidence that there's an attack focused on the United States at this point.
[01:14:46.826 --> 01:14:54.648]  And they have to say that because if they are planning an attack, they're having to block FBI and police and everybody else and defense intelligence like Abel Danger.
[01:14:54.868 --> 01:14:58.529]  They're having to fight with their own good people to let it go forward right now.
[01:14:59.207 --> 01:14:59.707]  Tooth and nail.
[01:14:59.727 --> 01:15:01.087]  There's probably hits going on.
[01:15:01.107 --> 01:15:02.748]  You name it, they're really moving.
[01:15:03.368 --> 01:15:05.388]  To keep people quiet, to make sure it goes ahead.
[01:15:05.788 --> 01:15:09.109]  And so, Chertoff can't admit specific knowledge of the Love Cup ability.
[01:15:09.409 --> 01:15:11.710]  They always say, oh, but it's not specific.
[01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:19.931]  And I just feel in my gut, we've all been saying we feel the tension, you know, like nothing we've felt in the last five and a half years.
[01:15:20.552 --> 01:15:21.752]  You see, and now this starts.
[01:15:23.032 --> 01:15:27.033]  But then I don't want to get on air and say, call the White House, call Fox News, call them all, and
[01:15:27.722 --> 01:15:29.683]  Tell them, you know, don't carry out a terror attack.
[01:15:31.263 --> 01:15:33.824]  I did that right before 9-11 and unfortunately I was right.
[01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:39.986]  So accurate that people now are seeing on the web in places that I'm behind 9-11, which is pretty ridiculous.
[01:15:40.666 --> 01:15:42.046]  Or that I'm a globalist or something.
[01:15:42.086 --> 01:15:44.007]  No, I was able to look at all the pieces and put it together.
[01:15:45.167 --> 01:15:55.090]  It's like a good cop who's been following a serial killer for 20 years and studying everything they do can pretty much guess when they're going to strike again or when the probability goes up or what area it's going to be.
[01:15:55.734 --> 01:15:56.555]  It's real simple, folks.
[01:15:56.635 --> 01:15:57.555]  I live this stuff.
[01:15:58.296 --> 01:15:59.497]  It's like you're a baseball fan.
[01:15:59.517 --> 01:16:00.338]  You live your team.
[01:16:00.358 --> 01:16:01.559]  You know what they're going to call next.
[01:16:02.559 --> 01:16:04.441]  You know what the pitch is going to be.
[01:16:04.821 --> 01:16:06.502]  I've been watching that pitcher for 10 years.
[01:16:09.725 --> 01:16:17.331]  I'm telling you, they're in a wind-up right now, and they are intending to throw a high-speed curveball.
[01:16:18.672 --> 01:16:20.713]  And I don't know if they're going to throw it.
[01:16:20.753 --> 01:16:21.434]  They might wait.
[01:16:21.494 --> 01:16:22.615]  They might throw a foul.
[01:16:23.371 --> 01:16:26.435]  They might decide to do something at the last minute, but they're in the wind-up right now.
[01:16:27.236 --> 01:16:30.541]  They're in the wind-up, and they right now are intending to throw that ball.
[01:16:30.821 --> 01:16:35.047]  I can feel it in my gut, and I can see it with all the available information.
[01:16:41.713 --> 01:16:44.575]  But at the same time, again, this is also a tactic they use.
[01:16:44.615 --> 01:16:46.336]  They may hold back.
[01:16:46.856 --> 01:16:53.860]  If we push and expose them, then they hold back, and then it's a catch-22, and you go, hey, you said there was going to be an attack, and then that's misrepresented.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:17:03.566]  No, I'm saying we, I mean, when the government's saying there's probably going to be a summer spectacular, I mean, right before 2004, they said we will be nuked.
[01:17:05.147 --> 01:17:05.407]  U.S.
[01:17:05.427 --> 01:17:06.988]  News & World Report, Dick Cheney told them that.
[01:17:08.527 --> 01:17:11.009]  Now, I got on air and I said, I don't think that's going to happen then.
[01:17:11.049 --> 01:17:12.010]  And I got criticized.
[01:17:13.571 --> 01:17:20.896]  And I saw disinfo agents, we all know who they are, saying Houston would be nuked and, you know, these people would call me up and I'd talk to them on the phone and pure fad.
[01:17:20.916 --> 01:17:23.798]  I mean, you could just hear the hissing voice and all the rest of it.
[01:17:24.078 --> 01:17:25.879]  You guys are pretty easy to pick out.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.601]  And I saw the disinfo going on.
[01:17:28.641 --> 01:17:30.662]  I said, no, no, not no, no.
[01:17:31.223 --> 01:17:32.744]  So many times I'm like, no, no, no.
[01:17:34.239 --> 01:17:36.540]  I've been telling you the last month, man, get ready for something.
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:37.540]  They're going to pull something.
[01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:38.681]  Everybody can feel it.
[01:17:38.701 --> 01:17:39.481]  Everybody can see it.
[01:17:39.761 --> 01:17:41.541]  I see them doing the preparatory phase again.
[01:17:42.002 --> 01:17:44.562]  Then they said, oh, we're going to have car bombings all over the country.
[01:17:45.483 --> 01:17:46.603]  We're going to be attacked.
[01:17:46.763 --> 01:17:47.923]  England, the U.S.
[01:17:48.084 --> 01:17:49.384]  Oh, Iran's going to be behind it.
[01:17:49.404 --> 01:17:50.524]  We need to attack them.
[01:17:51.465 --> 01:17:53.505]  Then Bush's approval rating drops even further.
[01:17:54.706 --> 01:17:57.887]  The EU merger deal with England starts getting in deep trouble.
[01:17:59.307 --> 01:18:02.548]  Let us hope they're just doing this to try to get their approval ratings up and just
[01:18:03.209 --> 01:18:06.791]  Stay in a holding pattern and not have their governments collapse.
[01:18:07.771 --> 01:18:09.872]  Let us hope that they're just going to back off now.
[01:18:10.792 --> 01:18:12.313]  Right now, I don't see that, folks.
[01:18:12.513 --> 01:18:16.054]  I see big attacks.
[01:18:16.535 --> 01:18:16.995]  Big ones.
[01:18:18.095 --> 01:18:21.437]  I mean, I mean Chicago nuked, New York nuked.
[01:18:21.597 --> 01:18:26.259]  I mean, if we're left, it'll be small and just some radiation attack.
[01:18:26.439 --> 01:18:26.959]  Dirty bombs.
[01:18:28.482 --> 01:18:31.363]  I mean, I mean news footage of a smoking city, folks.

[01:18:34.265 --> 01:18:36.186]  Sticking up like scarecrows.
[01:18:37.166 --> 01:18:39.187]  Hushed metal skeletons.
[01:18:40.108 --> 01:18:41.928]  I mean, bio-attacks.
[01:18:41.969 --> 01:18:42.429]  You name it.
[01:18:43.949 --> 01:18:45.090]  I mean, these people are ruthless.
[01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:45.910]  They mean business.
[01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:47.331]  They may be getting ready to launch.
[01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:48.652]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.672 --> 01:18:49.072]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.439 --> 01:18:58.002]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:18:58.402 --> 01:19:01.344]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:19:01.665 --> 01:19:04.226]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:19:04.587 --> 01:19:09.410]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:15.174]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:19:15.474 --> 01:19:18.416]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:19:18.616 --> 01:19:19.176]  We're good to go.

[01:20:26.212 --> 01:20:27.293]  Erosion accelerates.
[01:20:27.473 --> 01:20:30.015]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of U.S.
[01:20:30.195 --> 01:20:32.097]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[01:20:32.277 --> 01:20:34.799]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[01:20:34.980 --> 01:20:35.920]  Why attack Iran?

[01:21:53.402 --> 01:21:58.367]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegel with the Nutri-Medical Report here on Genesis After Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[01:21:58.707 --> 01:22:06.935]  Develop the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[01:22:07.035 --> 01:22:10.138]  Defense tabs block virus and bacterial entry into your tissues.
[01:22:10.319 --> 01:22:13.882]  Immunotate blocks the tissues by improving your host defenses by increasing
[01:22:13.882 --> 01:22:14.483]  We're good to go!
[01:22:38.763 --> 01:22:40.124]  I was a highwayman
[01:23:00.746 --> 01:23:09.169]  Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side.
[01:23:10.349 --> 01:23:13.590]  Many a young maid lost her marbles to my trade.
[01:23:16.251 --> 01:23:20.452]  Many a soldier shed his white blood on my blade.
[01:23:20.532 --> 01:23:25.674]  The masters hung me in the spring of twenty-five.
[01:23:27.446 --> 01:23:29.327]  But I am still alive.
[01:23:30.388 --> 01:23:35.230]  I was a sailor.
[01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:38.792]  I was born upon the tide.
[01:23:38.812 --> 01:23:44.015]  With the sea I did abide.
[01:23:45.216 --> 01:23:49.138]  I sailed a schooner around the Horn of Mexico.
[01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:55.001]  I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow.
[01:23:57.594 --> 01:24:03.039]  And when the odds broke off, they said that I got killed.
[01:24:03.079 --> 01:24:04.980]  But I'm living still.
[01:24:09.724 --> 01:24:10.885]  I was a dam builder.
[01:24:12.006 --> 01:24:16.330]  Across a river deep and wide.
[01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:19.092]  Where steel and water did collide.
[01:24:19.212 --> 01:24:24.657]  A place called Porter on the wild cardinal.
[01:24:27.296 --> 01:24:32.879]  I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below.
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:37.002]  They buried me in that gray tent that knows no sound.
[01:24:37.242 --> 01:24:40.544]  But I am still around.
[01:24:41.044 --> 01:24:44.826]  I'll always be around.
[01:24:44.947 --> 01:24:46.828]  And here's a Johnny Cash.
[01:24:46.928 --> 01:24:53.792]  Hey, you gotta... Gotta think about how transitory life is when we face challenges like we do now.
[01:24:57.227 --> 01:25:00.290]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:22.125 --> 01:25:31.010]  Now, again, we may be able to expose the New World Order on this, and they're testing right now, they're seeing how the fear-mongering works.
[01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:44.417]  The Republican memo from two years ago said that the Republican Party may completely die, may completely fail, that the whole New World Order agenda may stall if they didn't have massive terror attacks in the U.S.
[01:25:45.117 --> 01:25:47.699]  Their entire agenda is failing right now.
[01:25:48.179 --> 01:25:49.640]  They need the attacks.
[01:25:51.776 --> 01:25:58.201]  And I tend, with my analysis, to think it's going to be Miami, Dallas, Denver.
[01:25:58.541 --> 01:25:59.702]  CFR has said that.
[01:26:00.222 --> 01:26:01.503]  That's one reason I believe that.
[01:26:03.685 --> 01:26:06.527]  But again, they just love New York and they love L.A.
[01:26:07.468 --> 01:26:09.049]  You never know where the New World Order is going to hit.
[01:26:10.385 --> 01:26:15.589]  Now, they may be able to provocateur Muslims, whose, again, whose handlers are government informants or agents.
[01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:16.329]  They never know that.
[01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:22.693]  They may even be cooking some big bomb up, right now, like they did in 1993, but those never seem to go off good for them.
[01:26:23.454 --> 01:26:29.758]  And the type of people that are so dumb that they can provocateur are usually so inept that you see the type of thing you just saw in England.
[01:26:30.419 --> 01:26:33.861]  But that shows that the globalists are trying to activate these cells.
[01:26:36.286 --> 01:26:43.087]  And again, it's not my opinion that our government, the British government, the Israeli government, the Russian government, they've all been caught sock-puppeting Muslims.
[01:26:46.268 --> 01:26:47.148]  It's really that simple.
[01:26:47.868 --> 01:26:53.429]  And the Muslims aren't sophisticated enough to know, up the chain of command, they're actually being financed by Israel, the U.S.
[01:26:53.469 --> 01:26:53.889]  or England.
[01:26:54.969 --> 01:26:57.810]  But that's been declassified, that's come out, that's mainstream news.
[01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:05.671]  Hundreds of bombings in Israel carried out, headline, by fake Al-Qaeda groups created by Mossad and Shin Bet.
[01:27:06.508 --> 01:27:10.529]  The whole Idi Amin deal, totally staged, now declassified.
[01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:12.830]  That is declassified!
[01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:16.551]  What do the police listening not understand about that?
[01:27:17.452 --> 01:27:30.676]  When there were real terror attacks, 130 of them plus, in the 1970s, mainly against police in this country, by real communists, it was not in the news, it was not a big news item.
[01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:32.185]  Because that was real.
[01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:35.947]  You don't give real terrorism attention.
[01:27:36.167 --> 01:27:39.049]  That's the whole point of the terrorism, is to get the attention.
[01:27:39.970 --> 01:27:41.531]  Only the terrorists want attention.
[01:27:41.911 --> 01:27:48.776]  Now, who fear mongers this, and literally uses every verb they can, and every word they can, to make it sound as scary as possible?
[01:27:51.912 --> 01:27:57.456]  It'd be like having a daffodil in your hand and going, the deadly cobra had acid dripping from its steel jaws.
[01:27:57.836 --> 01:28:03.380]  I mean, that's about the level of hyping, or showing a dachshund and saying, the creature could defeat Godzilla.
[01:28:04.621 --> 01:28:06.202]  That's how they're hyping this up.
[01:28:06.322 --> 01:28:14.768]  I mean, they are just hyping and hyping and announcing, Al-Qaeda's yet to hit us with bio-weapons, with chemicals, with nukes!
[01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:17.790]  It's gonna be bigger than 9-11!
[01:28:18.131 --> 01:28:21.253]  It's gonna be spectacular!
[01:28:23.852 --> 01:28:25.632]  When we come back, I promise, we're going to go to your calls.
[01:28:26.393 --> 01:28:27.553]  It's been a lot of important news.
[01:28:27.633 --> 01:28:28.873]  I'll tell you what Lieberman's doing.
[01:28:29.293 --> 01:28:31.194]  Out of the gates.
[01:28:31.214 --> 01:28:31.754]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:33.415 --> 01:28:34.255]  On this subject.
[01:28:35.055 --> 01:28:36.495]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.777 --> 01:28:44.777]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.797 --> 01:28:46.798]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.718 --> 01:28:50.399]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.403 --> 01:28:57.485]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[01:29:13.715 --> 01:29:14.195]  I think so.
[01:29:35.954 --> 01:29:41.297]  Well, you can mail in your order to us at Most Holy Family Monastery, 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, New York, 14735.

[01:29:59.649 --> 01:30:04.792]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:09.882]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:30:10.322 --> 01:30:18.987]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[01:30:19.787 --> 01:30:25.130]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[01:30:40.703 --> 01:30:41.304]  Just call right now.
[01:30:55.311 --> 01:30:56.152]  Come on, Bill.
[01:30:56.372 --> 01:31:01.574]  Two weeks ago you were riding a bicycle, and today you're showing up in your new car and telling me you're buying a house?
[01:31:01.894 --> 01:31:03.395]  What did you do, rob Bill Gates?
[01:31:03.495 --> 01:31:05.476]  No, John, I didn't rob Bill Gates.
[01:31:05.756 --> 01:31:11.299]  What I did do is visit the website www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:11.579 --> 01:31:17.882]  That's where I learn how to make $3,000 to $9,000 each and every week, starting with my very first week.
[01:31:18.202 --> 01:31:20.363]  It's a simple program that does all the work for you.
[01:31:20.663 --> 01:31:24.106]  I'm already up to $25,000 just going on my third week!
[01:31:24.366 --> 01:31:24.746]  Whoa!
[01:31:25.167 --> 01:31:26.308]  What was that website again?
[01:31:26.328 --> 01:31:29.951]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:31:30.271 --> 01:31:31.372]  Now write this down, John.
[01:31:31.532 --> 01:31:35.835]  You should go there and learn how this program can help you become financially independent, too.
[01:31:35.995 --> 01:31:36.556]  Thanks, Bill.
[01:31:36.836 --> 01:31:38.017]  I'm going there right now.
[01:31:38.437 --> 01:31:39.078]  Check, please!
[01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:42.317]  Uh, you got this one, right, Bill?
[01:31:42.817 --> 01:31:43.417]  Sure, John.
[01:31:43.638 --> 01:31:48.021]  Don't forget, it's www.didyourobbillgates.com.
[01:31:48.321 --> 01:31:50.003]  Next time, you'll be buying me lunch.
[01:31:50.183 --> 01:31:50.523]  Deal.
[01:31:54.246 --> 01:31:57.389]  Well, you were sleeping.
[01:31:57.829 --> 01:31:59.030]  They took it all away.
[01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:03.113]  They came and took it all away.
[01:32:11.864 --> 01:32:15.766]  The place is where you used to place me.
[01:32:15.886 --> 01:32:21.770]  It was an inside joke, rather well-connected.
[01:32:23.291 --> 01:32:28.614]  You're a little frozen, so merrily rejected.
[01:32:28.674 --> 01:32:33.997]  It was an inside joke, like it always is.
[01:32:35.578 --> 01:32:39.100]  Chalk it up, to this desert.
[01:32:39.935 --> 01:32:43.497]  In the name of fighting terror, you can't videotape the police.
[01:32:43.857 --> 01:32:47.959]  In the name of fighting terror, you've got to be frisked from there on the streets.
[01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:53.322]  In the name of fighting terror, the feds have to put in cameras in your neighborhood.
[01:32:54.662 --> 01:32:58.004]  In the name of fighting terror, you have to be a slave.
[01:33:01.026 --> 01:33:07.709]  In the name of fighting terror, the government has to be secretive about where all the trillions of dollars go to private corporations.
[01:33:08.769 --> 01:33:11.150]  And there can't be investigations of their corruption.
[01:33:11.711 --> 01:33:13.892]  And the President has to be above the law.
[01:33:17.773 --> 01:33:20.135]  Have you noticed that they're announcing they're above the law?
[01:33:20.175 --> 01:33:21.595]  They've openly funded martial law.
[01:33:21.615 --> 01:33:23.816]  It says for insurrection and resistance.
[01:33:24.617 --> 01:33:25.777]  What is their planning to do?
[01:33:25.797 --> 01:33:29.439]  They think it's going to make all the yuppies get out in the streets and resist them.
[01:33:29.479 --> 01:33:30.119]  Don't forget.
[01:33:30.139 --> 01:33:37.163]  The International Bank of Settlements last week saying global depression could occur.
[01:33:39.053 --> 01:33:42.537]  And they're going to engineer it, but only if they think they can get away with it, see?
[01:33:42.837 --> 01:33:46.401]  So they will mesh a terror attack with the beginning of the Depression.
[01:33:47.162 --> 01:33:49.483]  To sabotage and go, Al-Qaeda hitting us!
[01:33:49.824 --> 01:33:50.344]  Triggered it!
[01:33:50.464 --> 01:33:51.665]  Oh, it's all their fault!
[01:33:51.705 --> 01:34:04.973]  And you'll even love your government more as they take your home and pension funds and learn to care about them so they can win and win the con and run game on us over and over again, giggling and snickering.
[01:34:05.453 --> 01:34:15.019]  But they will not drop the hammer, they will not kick the guillotine lever unless they think you're gonna buy it and run to their arms like a complete schmuck again.
[01:34:16.221 --> 01:34:21.662]  And they're testing and listening and sampling and polling and focus grouping right now!
[01:34:22.463 --> 01:34:26.104]  In fact, it came out, what, three years ago, the White House did big focus groups.
[01:34:27.324 --> 01:34:33.646]  Spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on national focus group tests of how you'd respond if there was another terror attack.
[01:34:34.086 --> 01:34:38.247]  The question was favorably or unfavorably to the President and their policies.
[01:34:40.267 --> 01:34:41.508]  And it was inconclusive.
[01:34:41.528 --> 01:34:45.749]  It was basically 50-50, and so they, hmm, let's try to recraft.
[01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:51.251]  And if they think he'll buy it, they'll lovingly kill a whole bunch of us.
[01:34:51.491 --> 01:34:53.092]  For the greater good, of course.
[01:34:54.052 --> 01:34:56.293]  For their New World Order, because they know best.
[01:34:56.673 --> 01:34:58.074]  They're the ones that are ruthless.
[01:34:58.534 --> 01:34:59.975]  They have the will to do it.
[01:35:00.335 --> 01:35:00.935]  We don't.
[01:35:01.815 --> 01:35:07.137]  We're going directly to Frank, Todd, Nima, Wesley, Tony, and others here in just a moment.
[01:35:10.038 --> 01:35:17.141]  I do want to tell the listeners about InnerFood.
[01:35:18.712 --> 01:35:24.095]  That nutrition is a breeding ground for illness, distress and anxiety, not to mention the loving chemtrails.
[01:35:24.215 --> 01:35:26.836]  Ask yourself, what is your diet like?
[01:35:26.876 --> 01:35:31.798]  Processed foods and even good organics don't have the nutritional values that you need today's world.
[01:35:32.079 --> 01:35:32.579]  Think about it.
[01:35:32.659 --> 01:35:36.721]  Have you forgotten that you are supposed to feel good and energetic all day long?
[01:35:37.021 --> 01:35:39.022]  And if not, you aren't getting the nutrition you need?
[01:35:39.402 --> 01:35:42.964]  Stop wishing you had more energy and focus and make it happen today.
[01:35:43.584 --> 01:35:52.132]  With one simple phone call to 1-866-762-9238 or visit them on the web at ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:35:52.152 --> 01:35:53.313]  That's ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:35:53.633 --> 01:35:55.735]  That's 1-866-762-9238.
[01:35:55.855 --> 01:35:57.796]  I take it every day.
[01:35:57.856 --> 01:35:58.777]  It's awesome stuff.
[01:35:59.218 --> 01:36:01.299]  ENERFOOD.COM.
[01:36:01.319 --> 01:36:02.681]  The best green food out there.
[01:36:02.721 --> 01:36:03.561]  Go check out the website.
[01:36:03.902 --> 01:36:06.384]  Find out all the great stuff they've got to offer for you.
[01:36:07.634 --> 01:36:14.880]  And then on top of that, there's a great company that's a sponsor of ours with this 84 different types of minerals in ionic form.
[01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:20.725]  The main ingredient, it's got a bunch in it, is the shellacate out of the Nepal-Tibetan Mountains there.
[01:36:21.646 --> 01:36:25.389]  We call them Nepal-Tibetan Mountains, it's the Himalayas, folks.
[01:36:26.135 --> 01:36:30.059]  Solutions from Science in Thomas, Illinois made this offer as easy to swallow as possible.
[01:36:30.479 --> 01:36:39.167]  So I've asked Solutions from Science to send you a three-month supply of their product called Shilicene and open a special line of credit for my listeners so you don't have to pay up front.
[01:36:39.547 --> 01:36:41.569]  It's very easy to do and have some sent to you.
[01:36:41.609 --> 01:36:42.730]  No credit card, no nothing.
[01:36:43.210 --> 01:36:44.972]  You just give them your name, address.
[01:36:44.992 --> 01:36:46.073]  It's in your three-month supply.
[01:36:46.393 --> 01:36:48.435]  And if you like it in three months, you pay for it and order more.
[01:36:49.887 --> 01:36:51.848]  You can't beat that deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:51.868 --> 01:36:52.928]  The Nothing Down.
[01:36:53.428 --> 01:36:55.469]  For my listeners, you've got to tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:36:55.749 --> 01:36:57.090]  Blacklistedherb.com.
[01:36:57.130 --> 01:36:58.330]  Blacklistedherb.com.
[01:36:58.630 --> 01:37:00.751]  Big fat banner on PrisonPlanet.com if you missed it.
[01:37:01.311 --> 01:37:02.151]  Or you can simply call 877-327-0365.
[01:37:02.171 --> 01:37:02.211]  877-327-0365.
[01:37:02.251 --> 01:37:03.692]  Great ionic mineral pack there for you.
[01:37:03.752 --> 01:37:04.472]  Alright, let's go to your calls.
[01:37:04.512 --> 01:37:05.432]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:37:19.722 --> 01:37:20.544]  I said I'd get to this.
[01:37:20.564 --> 01:37:23.329]  Let me cover this and then I'll go to your calls, because I've been promising for an hour to cover this.
[01:37:24.772 --> 01:37:28.238]  Lieberman calls for wider use of surveillance cameras.
[01:37:28.279 --> 01:37:30.302]  Now again, this is about making the elite secure.
[01:37:31.215 --> 01:37:43.300]  If there's armed resistance in the country, and to track you and trace you, and if you run when CPS is trying to take your children, or if you resist when they're trying to take your farmer land, this is the total Pentagon-designed control grid.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:44.660]  It's already in place.
[01:37:44.980 --> 01:37:54.384]  They just now want to claim they need more of Homeland Security control cameras, reading your lips, tracking your face, tracking your walk, everything you do, microphones going in coast to coast.
[01:37:54.964 --> 01:37:58.026]  Total Big Brother cameras in the school bathrooms, in the schools.
[01:37:58.447 --> 01:38:00.508]  Your child yells at someone, they go to jail.
[01:38:00.648 --> 01:38:01.809]  Maximum enforcement.
[01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:06.072]  Now, the military industrial complex federally pays bounties for children snatched.
[01:38:06.573 --> 01:38:09.174]  Literally, the CPS workers get bonuses for children taken.
[01:38:09.415 --> 01:38:11.756]  They're expanding and doubling the quota each year.
[01:38:11.856 --> 01:38:13.137]  Yes, doubling each year.
[01:38:13.478 --> 01:38:14.758]  Hell on Earth has been released.
[01:38:14.839 --> 01:38:17.160]  Over a million, four children grabbed each year.
[01:38:17.761 --> 01:38:18.541]  The Soviets did it.
[01:38:18.561 --> 01:38:19.222]  The Nazis did it.
[01:38:19.262 --> 01:38:20.202]  It's now happening here.
[01:38:20.222 --> 01:38:22.044]  Euthanasia is now happening under other names.
[01:38:22.364 --> 01:38:23.745]  The point is, we're in bad trouble.
[01:38:25.086 --> 01:38:34.948]  Senator Joe Lieberman, this is from the Hill, Democrat, Connecticut, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, said Sunday he wants more widely used surveillance cameras across the country.
[01:38:35.468 --> 01:38:37.669]  The Brits have got something smart going on in England.
[01:38:38.229 --> 01:38:40.189]  Yeah, they put in a control grid and they staged the terror.
[01:38:40.590 --> 01:38:50.912]  And it was part of why, I believe, they were able so quickly to apprehend suspects in the terrorist acts over the weekend, and that's why we have cameras all over London and other
[01:38:51.992 --> 01:38:52.933]  Of their major cities.
[01:38:52.973 --> 01:38:56.255]  Lieberman, you mean every four-way stop in every town like we have here?
[01:38:56.715 --> 01:38:58.716]  I think it's just common sense to do that here.
[01:38:59.076 --> 01:39:03.359]  Much more widely he added, and of course, we can do it without compromising anybody's real privacy.
[01:39:03.619 --> 01:39:04.600]  They always say that.
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.682]  Oh, we're going to track everything you do, but that doesn't compromise your privacy.
[01:39:08.902 --> 01:39:11.124]  But we won't put them on the border, and the border's going to stay wide open.
[01:39:11.524 --> 01:39:12.845]  And we're going to pump in more Muslims.
[01:39:13.405 --> 01:39:20.749]  Lieberman lamented the petty partisan fighting in Congress and called on his colleagues to join together to upgrade the nation's electronic surveillance capabilities.
[01:39:21.150 --> 01:39:21.370]  See?
[01:39:22.142 --> 01:39:24.643]  And we got a president saying he's above the law, and a vice president.
[01:39:24.683 --> 01:39:29.325]  We got Lieberman, known foreign agent of Israel, dancing on America's grave, giggling at us.
[01:39:29.725 --> 01:39:36.688]  Right now, we're at a partisan gridlocker with the question of whether the American government can listen to conversations of fellow emails of non-citizens.
[01:39:36.868 --> 01:39:38.669]  They listen to everything already, Lieberman!
[01:39:38.849 --> 01:39:45.171]  He's just trying to legitimize that, see, going, we don't have the security we need because we can't listen to everyone, to the non-citizens.
[01:39:45.191 --> 01:39:46.532]  They're listening to everything already!
[01:39:47.305 --> 01:39:50.188]  See, they're just trying to sell you what's already in place, okay?
[01:39:50.488 --> 01:39:52.349]  You little criminal dirtbag, and you know it.
[01:39:53.410 --> 01:40:00.136]  He said on ABC's this week, that's wrong, we've got to solve that problem, to pass a law to give people working for us the ability to protect us.
[01:40:00.916 --> 01:40:07.962]  Lieberman, who is more closely aligned with the GOP than the Democrats, says he causes with Iraq and many national security issues.
[01:40:10.644 --> 01:40:16.009]  You might say in Iraq, we've got the enemy on the run, but for some reason in Washington, a lot of politicians are on the run.
[01:40:16.966 --> 01:40:17.566]  To retreat?
[01:40:18.507 --> 01:40:19.928]  Another lie from you, you punk!
[01:40:19.948 --> 01:40:23.710]  Why don't you leave the United States, okay?
[01:40:25.871 --> 01:40:26.892]  Frank in Miami.
[01:40:27.773 --> 01:40:28.753]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:40:33.136 --> 01:40:33.476]  Frank!
[01:40:33.796 --> 01:40:34.717]  Sir, you're there!
[01:40:35.837 --> 01:40:37.018]  Hark there, Frank!
[01:40:37.118 --> 01:40:37.378]  Alright.
[01:40:37.879 --> 01:40:38.479]  Yep, you there?
[01:40:39.420 --> 01:40:39.940]  Let's let him go.
[01:40:41.226 --> 01:40:42.127]  Let's go to Todd.
[01:40:42.568 --> 01:40:43.608]  Todd, where are you calling us from?
[01:40:43.889 --> 01:40:46.070]  Hey, Alex, I'm calling from Minnesota.
[01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:46.971]  It's great talking to you.
[01:40:47.031 --> 01:40:50.474]  I've got a lot of great things to report concerning Ron Paul down in Iowa.
[01:40:51.094 --> 01:40:56.098]  First, I'd like to take about 45 seconds and bring attention to the worst Ron Paul hit piece I have ever seen.
[01:40:56.118 --> 01:40:58.019]  It's very easy to find.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.382]  Simply Google News, type in Haters of America.
[01:41:01.742 --> 01:41:02.723]  It's going to pop right up.
[01:41:03.163 --> 01:41:04.985]  This is from the American Chronicle.
[01:41:05.797 --> 01:41:10.638]  Edmund Soon-Codd, he has a master's degree in development economics.
[01:41:11.238 --> 01:41:12.758]  He's a former UN representative.
[01:41:13.599 --> 01:41:13.779]  Oh!
[01:41:14.099 --> 01:41:16.919]  Oh yeah, I mean my goodness, he is completely slamming Ron Paul.
[01:41:16.979 --> 01:41:24.061]  He's saying all this is... Well everyone knows the UN's good, and is pro-America, but Ron Paul is evil.
[01:41:24.361 --> 01:41:28.082]  I'm not going to read the article, but I'm going to take about 20 seconds to highlight what's in it.
[01:41:28.522 --> 01:41:32.042]  Our imagined threats, we're making them up, and it's making us hostile.
[01:41:32.502 --> 01:41:35.383]  Ron Paul's caveman economics in an age of Star Wars.
[01:41:35.848 --> 01:41:37.910]  All Ron Paul supporters are American haters.
[01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:40.312]  The public's happy he wasn't invited to Iowa.
[01:41:40.813 --> 01:41:44.256]  And there's no difference between left-wing truthers and Ron Paul supporters.
[01:41:44.316 --> 01:41:47.680]  And all of us are idiots because we don't understand the Federal Reserve.
[01:41:47.780 --> 01:41:49.101]  And in fact, he goes on to say...
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.643]  It's our constitutional duty to financially support the United Nations.
[01:41:54.484 --> 01:42:02.312]  Why don't you, because he's a good conservative and Ron Paul isn't, why don't you, by the way, police manuals now say it's illegal to have an anti-UN sticker on your car.
[01:42:02.853 --> 01:42:03.434]  I'm not kidding.
[01:42:04.134 --> 01:42:05.256]  Yes, that's America Today.
[01:42:05.716 --> 01:42:09.020]  Why don't you write an article for us and send it to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:09.961]  Aaron with two A's.
[01:42:10.781 --> 01:42:12.962]  And we'll get that up immediately.
[01:42:12.982 --> 01:42:16.303]  I mean, listeners, you just go ahead and do that.
[01:42:16.583 --> 01:42:23.425]  Do you have any comments about him saying we're going to have a huge summer of spectacular terror attacks and that the President may have to declare martial law for our safety?
[01:42:24.686 --> 01:42:30.287]  Well, my comments are, regardless of what one believes, one does need to look at the facts.
[01:42:30.868 --> 01:42:34.449]  And that through our government, everything is in place.
[01:42:35.309 --> 01:42:38.170]  That it's technically possible to completely go into martial law.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:46.742]  And Tommy Frank said, while on CIA payroll it turned out, now before I even ever saw that, I said, look he's wearing CIA cufflinks on TV.
[01:42:47.422 --> 01:42:50.003]  He's wearing CIA cufflinks on the cover of Cigar Fishing Auto.
[01:42:50.043 --> 01:42:55.984]  He says, oh the people want martial law and military government after the next attack.
[01:42:56.404 --> 01:43:03.866]  And he just again, breaking the ice with people, and it turned out he was on payroll of the government to go around and say that on CNN and Fox and everywhere.
[01:43:04.146 --> 01:43:06.327]  I mean folks, they're planning to make a move, okay?
[01:43:07.412 --> 01:43:10.233]  They got that criminal, and he is a criminal out there saying that.
[01:43:10.533 --> 01:43:11.153]  That's treason.
[01:43:11.754 --> 01:43:13.354]  Out there saying that on TV.
[01:43:13.734 --> 01:43:14.574]  He's a piece of filth.
[01:43:15.095 --> 01:43:16.615]  Look, they're planning it, okay?
[01:43:17.435 --> 01:43:20.977]  Because they want these pigs, they want to just sit over the... everything.
[01:43:20.997 --> 01:43:22.117]  They want to just suck us dry.
[01:43:22.137 --> 01:43:22.997]  They're a bunch of crooks.
[01:43:23.378 --> 01:43:24.578]  They're just bank robbers, folks.
[01:43:24.598 --> 01:43:25.358]  That's all they are.
[01:43:25.618 --> 01:43:26.779]  But they do it through the government.
[01:43:26.819 --> 01:43:27.159]  Go ahead.
[01:43:27.739 --> 01:43:28.339]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:43:28.359 --> 01:43:30.200]  I went down to Iowa yesterday.
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:31.540]  Man, was it great.
[01:43:31.900 --> 01:43:33.721]  I have never seen so many Ron Paul supporters.
[01:43:33.761 --> 01:43:36.262]  I knew I was in the right place because that's all I saw.
[01:43:36.903 --> 01:43:37.924]  Ron Paul supporters.
[01:43:38.084 --> 01:43:41.488]  They reported that there was maybe 800 in attendance for the main event.
[01:43:42.009 --> 01:43:42.710]  I didn't see them.
[01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:45.433]  The only people I saw were a handful of senior citizens.
[01:43:46.194 --> 01:43:48.196]  Mean and hateful, most of them.
[01:43:48.849 --> 01:43:54.590]  And they're just afraid that they just want somebody to tell them everything's alright.
[01:43:54.971 --> 01:43:56.091]  Watch Fox News.
[01:43:56.191 --> 01:43:56.751]  Absolutely.
[01:43:58.011 --> 01:43:59.252]  TV triggers Alzheimer's.
[01:43:59.272 --> 01:44:00.072]  That's been documented.
[01:44:00.092 --> 01:44:02.432]  Regardless of what reports are saying, these are the facts.
[01:44:02.632 --> 01:44:04.393]  I know the room held a thousand people.
[01:44:04.753 --> 01:44:06.733]  Almost every seat in the house was filled.
[01:44:06.773 --> 01:44:09.134]  There may have been like one in the middle where you can't hear.
[01:44:09.154 --> 01:44:10.454]  We have Ron Paul coming on Thursday.
[01:44:10.714 --> 01:44:12.055]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:44:13.755 --> 01:44:16.936]  The breakdown of the Ron Paul deal is this, because I have press reports of it.
[01:44:17.862 --> 01:44:18.923]  Mainstream press reports.
[01:44:19.643 --> 01:44:27.968]  At first they were having the main event, there was 500 people, then it was 400, then 200, then 100 by the end of it, and then like a thousand people for Ron Paul.
[01:44:28.389 --> 01:44:36.374]  Everybody left and went to Ron Paul's deal, and they totally took over and it backfired on the neocons in a big way, and now they're in panic mode.
[01:44:37.014 --> 01:44:39.996]  And I haven't seen this article about haters of America, but I've seen a bunch of others.
[01:44:40.919 --> 01:44:43.261]  Where they call him a caveman on economics.
[01:44:43.641 --> 01:44:50.946]  Well the fancy new modern stuff has got our dollar devalued at 13.6% per annum in the last 10 years averaged.
[01:44:51.727 --> 01:44:54.408]  Now the dollar is worth less than 1 cent what it was in 1913.
[01:44:54.869 --> 01:45:00.713]  Inflation is just completely blasting at full tilt boogie.
[01:45:01.891 --> 01:45:04.873]  We are in the edge of absolute financial collapse.
[01:45:05.874 --> 01:45:07.095]  I hope it doesn't happen.
[01:45:07.135 --> 01:45:13.499]  I hope they keep pumping the balloon up forever, because it's going to be so devastating if and when it pops that it will just shatter the mind.
[01:45:14.800 --> 01:45:18.902]  Total martial law has been geared up, and Ron Paul's got a fiscal plan.
[01:45:19.383 --> 01:45:26.868]  The man is a scholar, and a lot of top Austrian school of economics people have looked at it as a way to gear us out of this.
[01:45:28.008 --> 01:45:30.190]  Basically like trying to take a drug addict off heroin.
[01:45:31.458 --> 01:45:37.143]  We're in crisis mode, folks, and the government says, no, we're not going to get off heroin, we're just going to supply more higher dosages of it.
[01:45:37.904 --> 01:45:43.949]  And, okay, just, you know, go from one balloon to ten balloons a day.
[01:45:43.969 --> 01:45:51.836]  It's like Rush Limbaugh started out on one Oxycontin a day and at the end was at a hundred Oxycontins a day that would kill at least three full-sized horses.
[01:45:52.377 --> 01:45:53.097]  That was in the news.
[01:45:53.638 --> 01:45:55.039]  That's what your liver can gear up to.
[01:45:55.757 --> 01:45:59.979]  And the country literally is on the equivalent of like 150 Oxycontins a day, okay?
[01:46:00.359 --> 01:46:03.160]  We've gone above Rush Limbaugh levels, that's the analogy.
[01:46:03.841 --> 01:46:05.842]  And I mean, there's a certain point you OD, folks.
[01:46:06.522 --> 01:46:08.923]  And they've now prescribed even more Oxycontin for the country.
[01:46:09.243 --> 01:46:10.864]  I mean, I don't know how far this can go.
[01:46:10.884 --> 01:46:12.725]  I don't know how much we can handle.
[01:46:13.105 --> 01:46:15.466]  I don't know how strong our liver is.
[01:46:15.926 --> 01:46:17.847]  There's people who can drink a jug of whiskey every day.
[01:46:18.167 --> 01:46:19.428]  But it finally brings them down.
[01:46:20.223 --> 01:46:25.228]  And, you know, there's people that can drink four packs of cigarettes a day and drink, you know, three bottles of wine a day.
[01:46:25.849 --> 01:46:26.589]  I certainly couldn't.
[01:46:27.690 --> 01:46:29.772]  And, I mean, I don't know how far this country can go.
[01:46:31.073 --> 01:46:32.555]  But we're going to get cut down by this.
[01:46:33.996 --> 01:46:36.899]  And the elite is acting like they know we're about to implode.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:41.463]  Every major corporation is racing to get offshore.
[01:46:42.304 --> 01:46:44.006]  Every major corporation is panicking.
[01:46:44.985 --> 01:46:53.610]  Every major corporation is looting everything, running every scam, running up every form of derivative.
[01:46:53.971 --> 01:46:56.732]  They're openly on TV admitting everything in the stock market is a scam.
[01:46:56.752 --> 01:47:00.535]  They're just running around, foaming at the mouth, grabbing everything they can.
[01:47:01.315 --> 01:47:12.482]  They're acting like somebody's house is on fire, and they're trying to get the silver and the jewelry out, and they're running into a burning house, literally throwing stuff out the window right now, and then trying to climb down on a rope.
[01:47:13.504 --> 01:47:16.196]  And then greedily going back in in a fire suit to grab more.
[01:47:16.216 --> 01:47:18.465]  And the average yuppie's just stumbling around with...
[01:47:20.050 --> 01:47:45.879]  iPhones, and I don't blame you, I want one too, and just running around drinking Starbucks, and beautifying, getting collagen injections in your lips, and you're running five miles a day, and you're out in your bikini, and God love you, go enjoy Barton Springs, but I'm just telling you folks, we are in red level, 10 alarm fire, insane land, with the government saying brace for terror attacks.
[01:47:46.699 --> 01:47:49.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to Todd in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:47:50.231 --> 01:47:50.972]  All right, talk to Todd.
[01:47:50.992 --> 01:47:54.173]  Let's talk to Nima in wherever you're calling from.
[01:47:54.193 --> 01:47:54.794]  Where are you calling from?
[01:47:55.374 --> 01:47:56.915]  I'm calling from Toronto, Canada.
[01:47:56.975 --> 01:47:57.695]  Welcome, go ahead.
[01:47:58.656 --> 01:48:00.237]  I'm a first-time caller, Alex.
[01:48:00.897 --> 01:48:06.781]  I'm from Iran, and I live in Canada for 20 years now.
[01:48:07.801 --> 01:48:11.784]  And when I left the country, I was 12 years old.
[01:48:14.867 --> 01:48:20.171]  Three months ago, I decided to go back to Iran and visit my family for the first time.
[01:48:21.212 --> 01:48:27.717]  And when I went there, I was shocked how much Iran has changed.
[01:48:29.779 --> 01:48:39.226]  Under the sanctions and everything that is happening in Iran, they're still managing to build the country the best they could.
[01:48:40.127 --> 01:48:43.949]  At first, I'm from Tehran, the capital city, and when I got there,
[01:48:45.166 --> 01:48:47.287]  It is growing.
[01:48:47.927 --> 01:48:49.268]  The economy is growing.
[01:48:49.288 --> 01:49:05.854]  And the globalists cannot wait to bomb every power plant, every power station, every water treatment facility, every university, anything that quote has scientific value, every major bridge, and then just bomb you every few months for the next 50 years, just like Iraq's been for 17.
[01:49:06.214 --> 01:49:08.675]  That's right, almost 17 years of love.
[01:49:10.473 --> 01:49:13.154]  I'm gonna hold you over, sir, you've been holding, I want you to be able to make your points.
[01:49:13.755 --> 01:49:26.080]  But yeah, Serbia built itself up, any country that builds itself up, Somalia just built itself up to getting on its knees at least, not on its belly, so they had to be attacked in a CIA op.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:26.901]  Stay there!
[01:49:27.441 --> 01:49:36.265]  You see, and the Gordon was saying this, I mean, I have their official declassified documents, where they say we cannot allow any independent nations that aren't controlled by our money power, we will bombard you.
[01:49:37.273 --> 01:49:44.724]  And they don't care whether you're an Orthodox Christian, Serbs, or they don't care if you're Muslim, Iranians.
[01:49:44.764 --> 01:49:49.831]  They are going to drop tens of thousands of 2,000 pound bombs on you.
[01:49:50.432 --> 01:49:52.095]  And if you fight back, you'll be called terrorists.
[01:49:56.704 --> 01:50:02.170]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.531 --> 01:50:10.159]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.859 --> 01:50:17.921]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.321 --> 01:50:29.763]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.044 --> 01:50:33.564]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.004 --> 01:50:35.965]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.265 --> 01:50:40.046]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:54.588 --> 01:51:03.655]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:03.916 --> 01:51:15.145]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.485 --> 01:51:20.309]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:51:20.529 --> 01:51:20.689]  I think?
[01:51:39.872 --> 01:51:40.173]  We're good.
[01:51:53.672 --> 01:51:55.393]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:51:55.613 --> 01:51:59.315]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:51:59.635 --> 01:52:01.857]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:02.377 --> 01:52:08.580]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.740 --> 01:52:13.623]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.863 --> 01:52:14.243]  We're good.
[01:52:31.772 --> 01:52:32.633]  That's right!
[01:53:02.666 --> 01:53:04.206]  Alright, Nima in Canada.
[01:53:04.226 --> 01:53:07.547]  Hadn't been back to Iran since he was a child.
[01:53:07.607 --> 01:53:08.727]  Went back to visit family.
[01:53:10.128 --> 01:53:14.189]  And, uh, describe what you saw when you were, uh, when you went back to Iran.
[01:53:15.929 --> 01:53:29.112]  I saw, like, uh, I was shocked because, uh, under the sanctions, uh, usually when you have sanctions in your country, uh, the majority of people are poor or, uh, you know what I'm talking about.
[01:53:29.608 --> 01:53:33.711]  But they built a subway system.
[01:53:34.451 --> 01:53:38.613]  Tehran looks like Rome, like Europe, you know?
[01:53:39.814 --> 01:53:41.215]  It's very sophisticated.
[01:53:41.475 --> 01:53:46.118]  A lot of people move there to get a job, to go to work.
[01:53:46.818 --> 01:53:54.623]  And I decided to talk to, become a private journalist, a civilian journalist, as you call it.
[01:53:55.224 --> 01:53:59.266]  So I talked to a lot of Iranians on the streets, at homes,
[01:54:01.601 --> 01:54:11.126]  You know, about Ahmadinejad, what they think about the United States, the majority of Iranians are pro-American, you know, because we are Persian, we are not Arabs, you know?
[01:54:11.987 --> 01:54:23.994]  And when I talked to them, most of these people are university educators, doctors, professors, lawyers, and they told me what George Bush is thinking!
[01:54:24.134 --> 01:54:25.515]  We are pro-America!
[01:54:25.775 --> 01:54:29.277]  Why, in God's name, does he want to attack Iran?
[01:54:29.970 --> 01:54:37.796]  And you give the right-wing conservative government that is in power right now a lot of privilege.
[01:54:38.577 --> 01:54:44.341]  Because, you know, most Iranians... Like, the country is split 50-50.
[01:54:44.822 --> 01:54:49.506]  Like, 50% are in the side because Iran is a true democracy right now.
[01:54:49.546 --> 01:54:53.569]  It's an Islamic democracy, but it is a democracy with constitution.
[01:54:54.549 --> 01:54:58.933]  And in the Middle East, we have more rights in Iran than they have in Israel.
[01:54:59.723 --> 01:55:07.089]  Believe it or not, because in the media, in the web... Well, I know, in Israel, it's illegal for a Jew to marry any non-Jew.
[01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:13.694]  There's no media freedom, and if you're caught preaching the gospel anywhere, you're arrested and spend six years in prison.
[01:55:14.614 --> 01:55:17.356]  And Pastor Hagee gets on TV and defends that.
[01:55:18.157 --> 01:55:28.805]  And Alex, one thing that was surprising to me was, I went to one neighborhood, there was Jews, Christians, Muslims, people from different nationalities.
[01:55:29.461 --> 01:55:35.966]  Living in the same neighborhood, and I... Well, doesn't Iran have the biggest Jewish population of any Muslim country?
[01:55:36.766 --> 01:55:39.048]  Yes, and I talked to a lot of Jews.
[01:55:39.168 --> 01:55:46.853]  We have three Jewish people that are in the government right now, working for the Islamic Republic of Iran government.
[01:55:47.754 --> 01:55:55.179]  And I talked to them, and one of them told me, I said, is it true that Ahmadinejad, he wants to kill Jews and things like that?
[01:55:55.737 --> 01:55:57.778]  He said, it's a bunch of lies.
[01:55:58.018 --> 01:55:59.959]  Nobody has a problem with Ahmadinejad.
[01:56:00.039 --> 01:56:04.740]  Ahmadinejad is a former professor at the University of Tehran.
[01:56:05.781 --> 01:56:08.342]  And he's just been in power for two years.
[01:56:08.402 --> 01:56:13.444]  He said, why in God's name the West wants to attack us?
[01:56:13.864 --> 01:56:15.605]  We don't have any problem with the West.
[01:56:15.625 --> 01:56:21.347]  Well, that's because they've taken his comment about wiping the Zionists off the map and then they've turned that into wiping Israel off.
[01:56:22.094 --> 01:56:23.615]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:56:24.096 --> 01:56:35.805]  Even Ahmadinejad, when I was interviewing him in Iran, he clarified it like 50 times, and then the press never runs with that here.
[01:56:35.825 --> 01:56:37.046]  Well, I know this.
[01:56:38.371 --> 01:56:42.875]  They're saying that if the globalists attack your homeland, that you're not allowed to fight back.
[01:56:43.396 --> 01:56:44.977]  And that's the most amazing statement.
[01:56:45.017 --> 01:56:46.879]  I mean, Americans listening to this should go, wait a minute.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:51.223]  Even if you hate Iran, you can't find it on a map, but somebody told you to hate them, so you do.
[01:56:51.864 --> 01:56:53.805]  You probably think it's, you know, like in the Middle East.
[01:56:54.186 --> 01:56:55.247]  Not even in the Middle East, folks.
[01:56:56.208 --> 01:56:57.469]  I've talked to neocons on the street.
[01:56:57.569 --> 01:56:59.170]  I mean, they think it's in Saudi Arabia.
[01:56:59.210 --> 01:57:01.953]  These people, I mean, literally know nothing.
[01:57:02.806 --> 01:57:06.609]  Exactly, because they think all Iranians are brown faced.
[01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:12.614]  In Iran, we have people, my grandfather, he has blue eyes and you know, he's white.
[01:57:12.954 --> 01:57:19.799]  The word Aryan is out of Latin for Iranian.
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:23.962]  Iranian means Aryan, that's what it means in the language.
[01:57:24.202 --> 01:57:27.805]  Listen, I appreciate you coming on the show, thank you for calling in.
[01:57:28.125 --> 01:57:30.187]  We'll be right back with more of your calls to have you on.
[01:57:33.314 --> 01:57:38.224]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.861 --> 01:57:50.502]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.162 --> 01:57:52.223]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.943 --> 01:57:54.024]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.685 --> 01:57:55.505]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.286 --> 01:57:57.247]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.827 --> 01:58:01.530]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:06.093]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:17.577 --> 01:58:18.558]  Yeah, it's real simple.
[01:58:18.638 --> 01:58:19.919]  Iran's got a lot of oil.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:21.400]  They're modernizing.
[01:58:21.441 --> 01:58:22.582]  They're a first-world nation.
[01:58:23.382 --> 01:58:29.888]  They've got brains just as good as any brains, I mean, genetically, as anybody in the West.
[01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:35.673]  And they've got to be bombarded with ongoing thousands of Saudis.
[01:58:37.735 --> 01:58:40.237]  And that's not a Saudi Arabian, for neocon listeners.
[01:58:40.257 --> 01:58:41.499]  It's sorties.
[01:58:42.239 --> 01:58:42.940]  Aircraft attacks.
[01:58:44.326 --> 01:58:45.807]  We are taking calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:45.927 --> 01:58:50.370]  The feds have started a whole new salvo.
[01:58:50.390 --> 01:58:53.952]  I've never seen them fairmonger like this in the last three years.
[01:58:54.453 --> 01:58:56.874]  Remember all the fake terror alerts they got caught putting out?
[01:58:56.914 --> 01:59:01.797]  I mean, even the White House press secretary admitted they were putting out fake terror alerts for political aim.
[01:59:01.817 --> 01:59:03.819]  We got documents and memos on it.
[01:59:04.459 --> 01:59:06.220]  That's yelling fire in a theater right there.
[01:59:06.340 --> 01:59:07.241]  There's that facet.
[01:59:08.997 --> 01:59:20.246]  And then clearly these appear to be real live terrorists, real live idiots, but then it turns out, as usual, that the police knew, put out warnings, but were basically ordered to stand down.
[01:59:20.286 --> 01:59:26.450]  We know that two weeks ago they knew this was coming and these gasoline idiots were going to carry out some type of attack.
[01:59:27.351 --> 01:59:37.599]  Now again, and that's what P2OG says, the Pentagon plan says, we'll go in the Middle East, we'll go into Central Asia, we'll bombard these people, and then when they fight back we're going to call it terrorism.
[01:59:38.436 --> 01:59:39.616]  Now, I'm not condoning what they did.
[01:59:39.656 --> 01:59:40.197]  It's terrible.
[01:59:40.297 --> 01:59:41.677]  It's going to be used for a police state.
[01:59:42.197 --> 01:59:48.119]  But, I mean, you're 400 times more likely to be killed in a car wreck than you are to terrorism.
[01:59:48.199 --> 01:59:50.400]  Why are they saying, re-engineer our whole society?
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:51.781]  We can't question the government.
[01:59:51.801 --> 01:59:53.001]  We've all got to be slaves.
[01:59:53.521 --> 01:59:54.902]  That itself is terrorism.
[01:59:55.082 --> 02:00:00.784]  Using fear to get people to do what you want is terrorism, and the media and the government are engaging in terrorism.
[02:00:02.204 --> 02:00:05.365]  Let's go to Wesley in Idaho, then we'll go to Tony, Robert, and others.
[02:00:05.705 --> 02:00:07.186]  Wesley, you're on the air, and thanks for holding.
[02:00:07.748 --> 02:00:15.450]  Greetings Alex, I heard you about a week ago on Jeff Rent's program talking about music.
[02:00:15.550 --> 02:00:24.313]  I know that you know that music has a powerful effect on spirit, mind and body.
[02:00:24.453 --> 02:00:30.354]  So you are playing ACDC, Guns N' Roses, Jim Morrison?
[02:00:32.875 --> 02:00:33.075]  Hello?
[02:00:34.009 --> 02:00:34.690]  You're on the air, sir.
[02:00:35.090 --> 02:00:46.458]  Okay, well, I have to calm down listening to Chopin and Bach because we can't be too anxious or excited.
[02:00:46.798 --> 02:00:50.641]  We have to approach this thing with some peace and calm.
[02:00:52.602 --> 02:00:55.044]  That's just my comment, okay?
[02:00:55.064 --> 02:00:57.426]  No, no, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[02:00:59.113 --> 02:01:05.138]  Basically, this show needs to be on mainline commercial AM and FM stations.
[02:01:05.238 --> 02:01:11.643]  And there is a sound, there is a look, where the information isn't compromised here on the show.
[02:01:12.783 --> 02:01:14.605]  But we do have a lot of classical music.
[02:01:16.566 --> 02:01:22.431]  Let me think, about 8-9 years ago I sent all this classical music up there and 90% of it was never put into rotation.
[02:01:22.771 --> 02:01:24.052]  It was a different crew up there at the time.
[02:01:25.503 --> 02:01:31.248]  Since then, there is a lot of classical music, there is a lot of TV theme music, and I am intending to put all that in.
[02:01:31.749 --> 02:01:39.916]  And it's just kind of the library that the network's got of, you know, energetic music, and we got some country music in there.
[02:01:40.656 --> 02:01:43.579]  But, you know, I don't know how to explain this.
[02:01:43.999 --> 02:01:49.524]  If something comes up dressed in a devil outfit, and I'm not saying that music is, but something comes up dressed up in a devil outfit,
[02:01:50.778 --> 02:01:52.439]  Uh, it's probably not the best.
[02:01:52.459 --> 02:01:55.060]  What you really gotta watch out is a thing coming up at an angel.
[02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:58.001]  So the devil comes disguised as an angel of light.
[02:01:59.542 --> 02:02:02.463]  And you got all these Pastor Hagees and the rest of them out there.
[02:02:02.483 --> 02:02:11.366]  I mean, they wouldn't be heard, you know, playing country music, much less, uh, I don't know, Leonard Skinner or whatever.
[02:02:11.886 --> 02:02:16.228]  I mean, I don't, or, or, some other music like that, or Johnny Cash.
[02:02:18.286 --> 02:02:26.111]  And I'll take Johnny Cash over Pastor Hagee or some fake group of pervert, you know, preachers.
[02:02:28.413 --> 02:02:31.295]  Statistically, they're one of the highest groups of that after CPS.
[02:02:31.315 --> 02:02:32.095]  I just thought I'd add that.
[02:02:32.736 --> 02:02:33.736]  That's why I made that statement.
[02:02:33.776 --> 02:02:39.060]  So, so, you know, we may look foul, but don't we feel fair?
[02:02:40.141 --> 02:02:41.281]  We're on the side of the good guys.
[02:02:41.301 --> 02:02:41.902]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.547 --> 02:02:51.752]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:52.113 --> 02:02:54.016]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:02:54.416 --> 02:03:02.068]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:02.737 --> 02:03:09.799]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:10.179 --> 02:03:21.643]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.923 --> 02:03:25.844]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:25.884 --> 02:03:27.825]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:28.145 --> 02:03:31.926]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:51.331 --> 02:03:55.472]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:55.912 --> 02:03:56.753]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.053 --> 02:04:01.614]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.114 --> 02:04:04.236]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:04.736 --> 02:04:05.617]  Sheltering in Place!

[02:04:45.442 --> 02:04:47.924]  Do you know that you can go solar for under $1200 bucks now?
[02:04:48.464 --> 02:04:49.565]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[02:04:49.765 --> 02:04:53.887]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:04:54.514 --> 02:04:59.398]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[02:04:59.899 --> 02:05:06.344]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[02:05:07.080 --> 02:05:09.782]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[02:05:09.942 --> 02:05:19.909]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[02:05:20.189 --> 02:05:23.892]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[02:05:23.952 --> 02:05:30.436]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[02:05:30.616 --> 02:05:31.657]  Are you ready to go solar?

[02:05:45.646 --> 02:05:51.210]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:04.402 --> 02:06:05.983]  Tony in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:06:06.023 --> 02:06:06.764]  Thanks for holding.
[02:06:06.924 --> 02:06:08.385]  How you doing, Alec?
[02:06:08.605 --> 02:06:08.846]  Good, sir.
[02:06:08.866 --> 02:06:17.733]  Hey, I just wanted you to know that I'm sitting here in my Levi blue jeans with my copy of the Constitution in my back pocket and my cell, my prepaid cell phone over in the corner.
[02:06:18.493 --> 02:06:21.416]  And it warms my heart to hear you talking about Thomas Paine.
[02:06:22.870 --> 02:06:39.494]  You've got almost every terrorist... For those that don't know, the FBI training manual that goes out to the police department says, blue jeans, prepaid cell phone, pocket constitutions, land rights advocate, second amendment advocate.
[02:06:39.994 --> 02:06:42.975]  It says if you have an anti-UN sticker, go ahead and arrest you.
[02:06:43.415 --> 02:06:44.636]  That's in one of the training manuals.
[02:06:44.676 --> 02:06:46.296]  It says if they have it, just go ahead and bring them in.
[02:06:46.994 --> 02:06:49.354]  It actually says, just go ahead and bring him in!
[02:06:49.595 --> 02:06:52.795]  I mean, if that isn't tyranny on its face, I don't know what is.
[02:06:52.815 --> 02:06:57.496]  Yeah, I agree with you, but I tell you, like I say, it warms my heart to hear you talking about Thomas Paine.
[02:06:57.516 --> 02:07:00.336]  He is the most underrated founding father in this country.
[02:07:01.997 --> 02:07:03.677]  Everybody should get Common Sense and read it.
[02:07:05.037 --> 02:07:12.879]  Well, I read it when I was about 16 years old, and uh... I believe that's the one that says that to participate in a corrupt
[02:07:14.502 --> 02:07:16.263]  The system only gives it power, isn't it?
[02:07:16.483 --> 02:07:17.584]  Doesn't he say that in there somewhere?
[02:07:17.944 --> 02:07:18.965]  I believe he does, yeah.
[02:07:19.485 --> 02:07:25.989]  So, if you're voting, if you're paying taxes, in this corrupt government that we have, you are part of the problem.
[02:07:27.790 --> 02:07:43.179]  Well, you know, but they tried for close to 20 years to fix things peaceably, and then they quietly, but continually documented the crimes of the government, and that it was illegitimate, and then they just waited for the thugs to abuse the people like they always do,
[02:07:44.293 --> 02:07:46.274]  And that's what caused their defeat.
[02:07:46.934 --> 02:07:52.396]  And then they were willing for eight years to, on average, fight six to one against the British.
[02:07:52.736 --> 02:07:53.136]  That's right.
[02:07:53.196 --> 02:08:00.158]  Well, remember when the revolution started, before the revolution actually started, only a third of the Americans wanted to fight it.
[02:08:00.518 --> 02:08:01.339]  Less than that, sir.
[02:08:01.399 --> 02:08:03.679]  Three percent started it, five percent won it.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:04.420]  Right.
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:06.780]  And most were sitting in the middle.
[02:08:07.061 --> 02:08:11.362]  You know, some were loyal to the king, some were revolutionary, and most of the people were sitting in the middle.
[02:08:12.245 --> 02:08:22.871]  And today, I think, what we need to do is not so much concentrate on the people who are setting their ways, that watch Fox News, that, you know, believe Bush has got a direct phone line to God.
[02:08:22.911 --> 02:08:27.294]  We need to worry about those people in the middle that can still be convinced and have a little bit of an open mind.
[02:08:27.314 --> 02:08:31.677]  We need to talk to them and get them to start opening their eyes a little bit.
[02:08:31.697 --> 02:08:36.439]  I hear you, my friend, and I appreciate you calling into the show.
[02:08:36.479 --> 02:08:39.001]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Robert in California.
[02:08:40.595 --> 02:08:41.535]  Hello sir, how are you doing?
[02:08:41.635 --> 02:08:42.475]  Good, thanks for holding.
[02:08:43.355 --> 02:08:55.358]  Yeah, you know, like you, I'm lamenting on the way our situation of the state is at times, but I had a friend of mine call me and she recently woke up to this, as I have since 1939.
[02:08:55.498 --> 02:08:59.938]  I've been trying to tell people since, you know, what's been going on behind the scenes.
[02:09:01.319 --> 02:09:09.120]  She had a dream, and the dream was that her and a group of people came upon this body that was representative of the United States of America.
[02:09:11.638 --> 02:09:21.646]  They said, well, you know, all of a sudden the authorities are at the door and saying, oh, you know, they're going to, they're going to, you know, get mad because, and there was a whole bunch of people out there saying, bring him out, bring him out.
[02:09:22.426 --> 02:09:24.408]  And, you know, they're going, what are they going to do?
[02:09:24.428 --> 02:09:25.689]  They find out if he's dead.
[02:09:26.530 --> 02:09:33.375]  And, um, all of a sudden, um, the spirit of America came and says, just dress me up, you know, and just pretend I'm alive.
[02:09:33.435 --> 02:09:35.076]  And that's what they did to get out of the house.
[02:09:35.096 --> 02:09:38.438]  And it's pretty much what a New World Order is sort of doing.
[02:09:38.498 --> 02:09:40.240]  It's dressed up this dead body.
[02:09:41.294 --> 02:09:45.377]  Trying to say that it's alive, nor for them to get by.
[02:09:45.397 --> 02:09:48.559]  No, that's it.
[02:09:48.900 --> 02:09:57.246]  Listen folks, when I say 75% of water districts, schools, federal, that's an average, and that's about a year old.
[02:09:57.266 --> 02:09:58.186]  It's accelerating.
[02:09:58.527 --> 02:09:59.948]  It should be almost 80% by now.
[02:09:59.968 --> 02:10:04.231]  I've got to have the experts back on, including the former head auditor.
[02:10:04.927 --> 02:10:05.427]  We're good to go.
[02:10:27.179 --> 02:10:55.557]  To pay in even more money and investments in corporate welfare to them, and they've transferred most of the wealth out, now they're handing over, and I mean handing over, they're not even paying for it, the infrastructure, the roads, the highways, the schools, the national parks, and they're even, as collateral, the people pledged as taxpayers in the future, and I've read the documents, that is not an urban legend, folks, and we are completely, I mean, when you get up to 80%, that's complete, I mean, they own this country lock, stock, and barrel, but they got it through fraud!
[02:10:56.241 --> 02:10:57.441]  And so it's not legitimate.
[02:10:57.481 --> 02:11:02.262]  So they need a police state to enforce it, and they got a bunch of brainwashed idiots that'll do it.
[02:11:02.962 --> 02:11:15.544]  And now they're saying, no free speech, no protest, we're going to shut down the web, we're not going to let you videotape us, we're going to take your children for any reason we wish, no due process, and the President's above the law.
[02:11:15.804 --> 02:11:18.225]  I mean, folks, that's really happening!
[02:11:19.005 --> 02:11:20.185]  I just can't believe it!
[02:11:20.825 --> 02:11:22.385]  It's really happening!
[02:11:22.405 --> 02:11:25.206]  I mean, it's just unbelievable!
[02:11:25.746 --> 02:11:26.926]  Anything else you want to add there?
[02:11:27.567 --> 02:11:29.487]  Well, you know, and you're exactly right.
[02:11:29.527 --> 02:11:34.949]  It is, it is unbelievable, but I, you know, I don't think they're necessarily handing it over.
[02:11:34.989 --> 02:11:41.111]  I think these people bought it back door a long time ago and now they're just coming to take possession of it.
[02:11:41.251 --> 02:11:45.132]  And, um, you know, recently I just went out and purchased another rifle.
[02:11:45.172 --> 02:11:47.773]  There's a nice little collector rifle, a bayonet on it.
[02:11:47.833 --> 02:11:52.835]  And, you know, um, I didn't really feel the need to purchase any more weapons, but, uh,
[02:11:53.740 --> 02:12:03.324]  You know, it's time to get armed and I've been preparing, you know, with water filters and extra food and trying to get my family, you know, just to live the daily life.
[02:12:03.404 --> 02:12:04.845]  But, you know, be prepared for that.
[02:12:05.005 --> 02:12:07.986]  And don't ever get your neighbors and family to fully believe you.
[02:12:08.426 --> 02:12:10.767]  Tell them what's going to happen and then when it happens, they'll know.
[02:12:10.787 --> 02:12:17.810]  You see, remember, there are billions of seeds in the Infowar that we planted globally and that you planted lovingly.
[02:12:18.450 --> 02:12:21.172]  And again, the tyranny is the water and sunshine, okay?
[02:12:21.212 --> 02:12:22.192]  It has that same effect.
[02:12:22.759 --> 02:12:28.838]  And it is going to be explosive resistance when they make their final moves, if they're stupid enough to.
[02:12:29.977 --> 02:12:30.478]  Exactly.
[02:12:30.618 --> 02:12:44.469]  And also, we must be having an effect on Ron Paul's campaign because I've seen more and more hit pieces and more stuff that he's said in the past, what they're dredging up and trying to put their particular spin on it.
[02:12:45.009 --> 02:12:58.340]  So, if we just keep to our guns... He once had an aide that wrote an article, and well at the time Ron Paul retracted it, 15 years ago, but that doesn't matter.
[02:12:59.667 --> 02:13:00.128]  Exactly.
[02:13:00.208 --> 02:13:05.751]  So we're doing good, and we are winning the war as far as the information.
[02:13:06.232 --> 02:13:19.620]  And almost everybody I talk to, whether it's a man on the street buying my groceries, buying whatever I feel like that day, or whoever I come across eating lunch on the outside of things, I said, have you heard about Ron Paul?
[02:13:22.402 --> 02:13:28.606]  And then Ron Paul is a palatable, conservative doorway for people to enter into the rabbit hole.
[02:13:29.326 --> 02:13:29.607]  Yes.
[02:13:30.148 --> 02:13:34.836]  And sooner or later we will have an effect, at least if not in this America, in the next.
[02:13:35.738 --> 02:13:36.299]  Absolutely.
[02:13:36.379 --> 02:13:37.902]  Oh yeah, we're going the full course.
[02:13:37.942 --> 02:13:38.884]  We're going the distance.
[02:13:39.485 --> 02:13:39.705]  Yes.
[02:13:40.026 --> 02:13:40.767]  We're going all the way.
[02:13:40.787 --> 02:13:41.568]  I appreciate your call.
[02:13:42.139 --> 02:13:43.539]  I mean, we're going all the way, folks.
[02:13:43.819 --> 02:13:54.381]  You have to understand, even if you want to serve this system, even if you want to go along with it and lie to yourself and make excuses, or maybe you're smart, but evil, or really cowardly deep down, you just decide to be evil.
[02:13:54.481 --> 02:13:59.482]  A lot of cowards are afraid and they decide to gut up and then go, I'm for it then.
[02:14:00.283 --> 02:14:02.163]  Now, that's kind of the attitude I've seen out there.
[02:14:02.183 --> 02:14:04.903]  There's a lot of smart people who just go, okay, it is bad.
[02:14:05.404 --> 02:14:06.464]  I'm just going to join it then.
[02:14:06.484 --> 02:14:07.684]  That'll be a better position for me.
[02:14:09.133 --> 02:14:12.056]  You're getting swept along with this like everybody else.
[02:14:12.096 --> 02:14:13.297]  This thing is indiscriminate.
[02:14:13.677 --> 02:14:14.858]  Tyranny is hungry.
[02:14:15.699 --> 02:14:23.345]  It puts psychopaths and criminals in positions of power because they will follow the immoral orders of their commanders.
[02:14:24.085 --> 02:14:29.150]  But they're also allowed to collect booty, tribute from the host population.
[02:14:29.570 --> 02:14:30.831]  It's always been that way.
[02:14:30.951 --> 02:14:32.292]  It will always be that way.
[02:14:32.833 --> 02:14:38.077]  And finally, the corruption, even if they win the first wave, will get so bad that it will fall apart.
[02:14:39.213 --> 02:14:40.033]  It will fall apart.
[02:14:41.094 --> 02:14:59.518]  The corruption by 1989 in China had gotten so ridiculous with Communist Party members living in huge palaces and owning factories and walking around with jewels hanging off of them, and literally killing people for their organs, that the Communists and a bunch of Conservatives and Libertarians, but even mainline Communists said, this isn't a Communist system.
[02:15:00.079 --> 02:15:05.240]  Hundreds of thousands went out and got mowed down and shot and killed, you know, 14,000 of them, but millions went out on the streets.
[02:15:05.896 --> 02:15:10.019]  But that caused the Chinese to have to do a bunch of reforms and back off a lot.
[02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:15.082]  You see, they lost that thing, going out and shooting all those crowds.
[02:15:15.122 --> 02:15:15.803]  They lost there.
[02:15:18.164 --> 02:15:19.726]  And the New World Order is going to do that here.
[02:15:21.347 --> 02:15:23.048]  Don't you worry, folks.
[02:15:23.934 --> 02:15:38.654]  But see, they're thinking, well, we can put in cameras and control grids and have a big enough social service net to tie everybody up in taxes, you have enough bureaucrats and police to be able to assault the public, and they've got incremental computer models about how they're going to do it.
[02:15:39.155 --> 02:15:40.537]  I mean, it's cold-blooded!
[02:15:41.115 --> 02:15:47.437]  And of course, the average cop or CPS worker doesn't even know about those models, or the federal funds, or the consortium meeting documents we've got.
[02:15:47.757 --> 02:15:50.158]  I mean, you're working for some cold-blooded people!
[02:15:50.278 --> 02:15:52.099]  I mean, let me give you the newsflash!
[02:15:52.379 --> 02:15:53.959]  There's some cold-blooded mothers!
[02:15:55.520 --> 02:16:00.022]  And, um... I just can't believe it's this real.
[02:16:01.522 --> 02:16:02.242]  It's real, folks.
[02:16:02.662 --> 02:16:04.743]  But, you know, wishing and hoping isn't going to change it.
[02:16:04.783 --> 02:16:06.984]  In fact, what was it that Patrick Henry said?
[02:16:07.004 --> 02:16:09.925]  About a lot of people don't want to know the truth?
[02:16:11.647 --> 02:16:14.289]  We are apt to shut our eyes against the painful truth.
[02:16:15.050 --> 02:16:19.093]  For my part, I'm willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst, and to provide for it.
[02:16:20.314 --> 02:16:20.754]  Exactly.
[02:16:20.994 --> 02:16:26.138]  My analogy is, you're walking around a field at night, and it's got a bunch of 20-foot pits in it.
[02:16:26.158 --> 02:16:28.540]  You can fall and break your leg in, or worse.
[02:16:29.340 --> 02:16:33.944]  Am I a fearful, bad person that I say you need a flashlight and be careful out there?
[02:16:34.784 --> 02:16:36.226]  No, I'm trying to be in power.
[02:16:36.286 --> 02:16:37.426]  I'm trying to be in control.
[02:16:37.887 --> 02:16:39.388]  I'm trying to be in charge of my life.
[02:16:40.507 --> 02:16:41.467]  I want to be empowered.
[02:16:42.008 --> 02:16:43.808]  I want to control my life.
[02:16:43.988 --> 02:16:47.329]  I want to have the power in my life, so I can protect myself and my family.
[02:16:48.169 --> 02:16:51.170]  They want to be in power, folks, over us, controlling us.
[02:16:51.511 --> 02:16:54.231]  And they tell you, oh, there's no such thing as pits.
[02:16:54.912 --> 02:16:58.793]  Just wander out in that field, and they'll listen to Alex Jones.
[02:16:59.153 --> 02:17:08.656]  He's a conspiracy theorist, because they know you're an expert on ball games and how to act tough, and that's about it.
[02:17:10.309 --> 02:17:15.510]  Or women are all in this big mass psychology of feeling inadequate and believe in Madison Avenue.
[02:17:18.811 --> 02:17:26.133]  And so you're all off in this delusional fruitcake land while there's some hardcore killers who kill 200 million people.
[02:17:27.073 --> 02:17:31.294]  Folks, I've been studying them like I never have before for Endgame and I mean it makes me stagger some nights.
[02:17:31.635 --> 02:17:34.495]  Some nights we'll all sit around here shaking our heads going, my God!
[02:17:34.915 --> 02:17:36.176]  It was worse than we thought!
[02:17:36.196 --> 02:17:37.036]  I mean, these people are
[02:17:37.634 --> 02:17:40.080]  There's so much evil, how do you even present it all?
[02:17:40.942 --> 02:17:42.806]  I mean, it's just all out in the open!
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:52.102]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.462 --> 02:17:56.544]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.844 --> 02:17:57.404]  We listened.
[02:17:57.704 --> 02:18:02.687]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.947 --> 02:18:03.447]  We listened.
[02:18:03.827 --> 02:18:06.868]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:07.289 --> 02:18:07.809]  We listened.
[02:18:08.289 --> 02:18:12.353]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.733 --> 02:18:13.214]  We listened.
[02:18:13.554 --> 02:18:18.798]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:19.219 --> 02:18:20.560]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.940 --> 02:18:22.522]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:18:22.702 --> 02:18:28.267]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:18:28.707 --> 02:18:31.329]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[02:18:31.549 --> 02:18:31.750]  Only $279.
[02:18:31.810 --> 02:18:32.390]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[02:18:32.430 --> 02:18:32.670]  That's 888-03-4438.
[02:18:32.730 --> 02:18:34.352]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:18:34.372 --> 02:18:35.332]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:46.801 --> 02:18:47.842]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.262 --> 02:18:53.727]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:54.308 --> 02:18:54.808]  That's right.
[02:18:55.128 --> 02:18:57.410]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:57.971 --> 02:19:04.897]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:05.453 --> 02:19:13.157]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:13.577 --> 02:19:18.380]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.062 --> 02:19:24.086]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:24.867 --> 02:19:29.010]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:29.390 --> 02:19:29.631]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.651 --> 02:19:31.592]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:31.652 --> 02:19:31.953]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:32.253 --> 02:19:32.533]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.972 --> 02:19:47.915]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:19:48.075 --> 02:19:53.300]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:58.905]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:19:59.305 --> 02:20:00.426]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:00.787 --> 02:20:09.695]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:20:10.095 --> 02:20:11.697]  Now compare a Calvin Pure Soap.
[02:20:11.938 --> 02:20:16.123]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.

[02:20:45.214 --> 02:20:46.975]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:20:47.075 --> 02:20:48.355]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:48.575 --> 02:20:51.396]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:51.756 --> 02:20:54.517]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[02:20:55.057 --> 02:21:01.779]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:21:59.270 --> 02:22:03.032]  Now FEMA controls every radio and TV station so the Pentagon can take over.
[02:22:03.052 --> 02:22:07.195]  In the past stations were instructed to tune to a local station that was under FEMA control.
[02:22:07.775 --> 02:22:09.697]  Now it's all stations under FEMA control.
[02:22:09.777 --> 02:22:11.017]  Cable, TV, everything.
[02:22:11.978 --> 02:22:21.284]  And they've got hubs to take over the web and shut down most websites and big sites will all be under federal control and reroute to a homeland security domain.
[02:22:23.709 --> 02:22:25.810]  Listen to this newscast about what accidentally happened.
[02:22:25.830 --> 02:22:26.311]  Here it is.
[02:22:26.971 --> 02:22:36.056]  On at the airwaves on Chicago radio and TV stations today, including CBS 2, a lot of viewers were frightened by a signal that sounded like an emergency alert.
[02:22:36.436 --> 02:22:37.877]  Here's CBS 2's Katie McCall.
[02:22:38.678 --> 02:22:41.279]  If you were watching CBS 2 at 7.30 this morning, you heard something unusual.
[02:22:48.982 --> 02:22:55.487]  An emergency alert system message, normally issued to viewers about a federal emergency, went out during the early show.
[02:22:55.847 --> 02:22:57.508]  Jan Hergesheimer was watching.
[02:22:58.028 --> 02:23:03.392]  I was actually thinking of calling all my relatives and waking them up and telling them to get down in the basement.
[02:23:03.732 --> 02:23:11.978]  She thought the country was under attack, but instead of instructions, she, like millions of Illinois TV viewers, heard a WGN radio sports program.
[02:23:16.382 --> 02:23:20.385]  Over at WCKG Radio, Gary Meyer was preparing to go on the air.
[02:23:20.585 --> 02:23:23.508]  He also heard WGN and received this printout.
[02:23:24.129 --> 02:23:27.712]  And it said that this is not a test, this is a real alert.
[02:23:28.263 --> 02:23:31.725]  That the President's going to talk in a few minutes, so do not disarm this alert.
[02:23:32.145 --> 02:23:36.287]  WGN was broadcast because it is the designated emergency alert station.
[02:23:36.587 --> 02:23:37.467]  They didn't even know what to do.
[02:23:38.028 --> 02:23:47.552]  It turns out the Illinois Office of Emergency Management was testing a new satellite warning system, and instead of sending out an internal test code, a real message went out.
[02:23:47.872 --> 02:23:50.753]  It's still under investigation as to how that message went out.
[02:23:51.554 --> 02:23:56.416]  All you see was alerted right away that it wasn't a true emergency.
[02:23:57.242 --> 02:24:03.047]  Unfortunately, those messages are automatic, so there was no way for stations like ours to override the alert.
[02:24:03.427 --> 02:24:08.352]  We're glad viewers like Jan emailed our website so we could tell her there was no emergency.
[02:24:08.732 --> 02:24:10.193]  Katie McCall, CBS2 News.
[02:24:10.213 --> 02:24:14.757]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to have Aaron do a blurb on this for JonesReport.com.
[02:24:14.777 --> 02:24:17.600]  By the way, that site's just exploding thanks to the hard work he's been doing on it.
[02:24:18.601 --> 02:24:24.766]  It was like number 12,000 on the web last week, and I think it's averaged like 60,000 now on the web, which is a big site.
[02:24:26.643 --> 02:24:30.107]  Uh, by any stretch, and he's just been building on it for a year now.
[02:24:31.228 --> 02:24:38.215]  We'll have Aaron put together a piece on that with a clip from Police State 2000, where I show you the EAS system.
[02:24:38.735 --> 02:24:40.778]  By the way, that was a drill.
[02:24:40.838 --> 02:24:42.419]  They have the satellite system in by 98.
[02:24:43.590 --> 02:25:02.073]  They retrofitted at the tower by federal law under regulatory commission of the FCC that all the wires, the last transmission wires that go into the antenna at the tower have it with a receiver and then it's double backed up if your broadcast booth isn't
[02:25:02.668 --> 02:25:04.549]  And your control room isn't at location.
[02:25:05.090 --> 02:25:09.792]  The last wires, uh, certified, FCC comes and checks it by our engineer.
[02:25:09.812 --> 02:25:12.514]  It was very expensive to put in, by the way, for every station that had to do it.
[02:25:12.934 --> 02:25:15.836]  Some cases it cost over $50,000 that the station had to pay for.
[02:25:15.856 --> 02:25:17.657]  This is very expensive equipment.
[02:25:18.337 --> 02:25:21.920]  Uh, and you, they had to put it in in the chain so it's the last piece of equipment.
[02:25:22.780 --> 02:25:25.082]  And they get little Homeland Security teletypes.
[02:25:25.162 --> 02:25:26.222]  I have one of the manuals.
[02:25:26.763 --> 02:25:28.303]  It's all about martial law.
[02:25:29.064 --> 02:25:30.685]  And they were testing out the satellite.
[02:25:32.251 --> 02:25:38.476]  And so it took over all the stations, TV, radio, everything.
[02:25:40.497 --> 02:25:41.478]  And they're in Chicago.
[02:25:41.498 --> 02:25:43.899]  And everybody got real scared.
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:46.501]  Well, you better be scared.
[02:25:46.521 --> 02:25:49.803]  You got a government getting ready for the President to come on and make some announcements.
[02:25:50.564 --> 02:25:53.646]  They're just doing a little test with El Presidente in where?
[02:25:54.327 --> 02:25:56.068]  In Chicago.
[02:25:58.777 --> 02:26:02.019]  Let me just tell you folks, Larry Silverstein bought the Sears Tower.
[02:26:04.841 --> 02:26:05.961]  That's just classic.
[02:26:08.783 --> 02:26:13.486]  There's no end to these people and there's no end to what... Now they funded martial law last year, it's funded for this year.
[02:26:14.026 --> 02:26:14.707]  Official funding.
[02:26:15.207 --> 02:26:18.529]  They said for civil disobedience or mass revolts or any type of resistance.
[02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:21.271]  The president preemptively has dissolved the governors.
[02:26:21.331 --> 02:26:22.612]  They actually are puppets now.
[02:26:23.772 --> 02:26:26.014]  He is also then on May 9th, a month ago,
[02:26:26.866 --> 02:26:28.628]  A month and a half ago, a day that lived in infamy.
[02:26:29.268 --> 02:26:30.410]  The biggest thing I've ever seen.
[02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:32.952]  Said Congress isn't even in continuity of government.
[02:26:33.132 --> 02:26:34.894]  Now, he doesn't have the authority to say that, but he did it.
[02:26:35.475 --> 02:26:37.497]  Just like Dick Cheney said, I'm above everything.
[02:26:38.658 --> 02:26:39.979]  I'm outside of everything.
[02:26:40.019 --> 02:26:40.920]  I'm outside of the law.
[02:26:41.401 --> 02:26:42.582]  I'm outside of the executive.
[02:26:45.044 --> 02:26:46.466]  They're putting up test balloons.
[02:26:46.626 --> 02:26:48.868]  Now, the good news is he's got a 9% approval rating.
[02:26:51.900 --> 02:26:55.042]  The question is, will you love them again if they hurt you?
[02:26:55.602 --> 02:26:57.203]  Like a woman who gets beaten by her husband.
[02:26:58.784 --> 02:27:02.786]  Is he going to let Cheney whack you upside the head a couple more times?
[02:27:02.846 --> 02:27:03.486]  He probably will.
[02:27:04.167 --> 02:27:09.109]  Run back to his arms, jump in his arms, festoon your vehicles with George Bush stickers again.
[02:27:09.129 --> 02:27:10.230]  Or Hillary.
[02:27:10.830 --> 02:27:13.932]  When that woman gets in, you better believe they're going to let some terror roll.
[02:27:13.952 --> 02:27:15.793]  So you learn to love her properly.
[02:27:18.397 --> 02:27:26.281]  Big article up on PrisonPlanet.com about this being a propaganda coup for the Bush administration, and one of these guys is an Iraqi-born doctor.
[02:27:27.961 --> 02:27:29.842]  We're going into the next phase of the game.
[02:27:29.862 --> 02:27:31.983]  Gordon Brown is in command.
[02:27:35.765 --> 02:27:36.685]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.146 --> 02:27:38.746]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.687 --> 02:27:42.348]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.973 --> 02:27:48.696]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[02:27:49.156 --> 02:27:51.439]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[02:27:51.739 --> 02:27:54.822]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[02:27:55.303 --> 02:27:57.465]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[02:27:57.625 --> 02:27:59.006]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[02:27:59.267 --> 02:28:03.391]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[02:28:03.731 --> 02:28:06.854]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[02:28:07.135 --> 02:28:08.376]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[02:28:09.577 --> 02:28:17.864]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[02:28:18.224 --> 02:28:20.926]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[02:28:21.286 --> 02:28:28.592]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol, and prescription medications.
[02:28:28.972 --> 02:28:34.580]  To order LIV52 and for the best source of researched herbal products, visit research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482.
[02:28:34.601 --> 02:28:36.824]  That's research-herbs.com or call 1-800-973-1482 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:28:47.046 --> 02:28:48.266]  This is Elizabeth Border.
[02:28:48.827 --> 02:28:49.487]  News Alert!
[02:28:49.987 --> 02:28:54.209]  Twice a month you can now get the Divided Kingdom's brand new newsletter.
[02:28:54.649 --> 02:28:55.269]  Concise?
[02:28:55.509 --> 02:28:56.129]  Hard-hitting?
[02:28:56.489 --> 02:28:59.451]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[02:28:59.491 --> 02:29:00.951]  War in Iran?
[02:29:00.971 --> 02:29:03.152]  A coming One World Church?
[02:29:03.912 --> 02:29:09.217]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.
[02:29:09.717 --> 02:29:17.164]  For a free sample copy of the Divided Kingdom dossier, write to Post Office Box 8, Bethlehem, Maryland, 21609.
[02:29:19.506 --> 02:29:25.752]  A yearly subscription is only $50 for a newsletter that comes not once, but twice every month.
[02:29:26.272 --> 02:29:31.834]  Get the spiritual support you need right now for your free sample copy to P.O.
[02:29:31.874 --> 02:29:35.215]  Box 8 Bethlehem, MD 21609.
[02:29:35.676 --> 02:29:41.258]  Once again, for your free copy of the Divided Kingdom Dossier newsletter, write to P.O.
[02:29:41.298 --> 02:29:42.578]  Box 8 Bethlehem, MD 21609.
[02:29:46.298 --> 02:29:46.719]  Attention!
[02:29:46.839 --> 02:29:49.643]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[02:29:49.943 --> 02:29:54.249]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:29:54.570 --> 02:29:55.251]  Listen closely.
[02:29:56.212 --> 02:30:01.319]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product considered to be the single most
[02:30:01.459 --> 02:30:01.839]  I don't know.
[02:30:18.533 --> 02:30:27.997]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now, a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[02:30:28.177 --> 02:30:33.820]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:37.581]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[02:30:37.821 --> 02:30:41.143]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[02:30:55.285 --> 02:30:59.126]  I want to read some famous globalist quotes and some founding father quotes as well.
[02:31:02.808 --> 02:31:04.728]  But, in fact, I left those in the other room.
[02:31:05.609 --> 02:31:10.030]  Can you guys, so I don't have to jump up and run and get them, can you bring me the founding father quotes, please?
[02:31:10.510 --> 02:31:10.930]  Thank you.
[02:31:11.831 --> 02:31:15.432]  Along with the New World Order quotes, or I guess I can Google them up again.
[02:31:15.452 --> 02:31:21.014]  I tend to print them off and walk around leaving little doblets of articles about the office.
[02:31:24.813 --> 02:31:30.637]  If you go up to PrisonPlanet.com, you can read the AP article, device similar to a pipe bomb explodes at Disney.
[02:31:31.797 --> 02:31:35.540]  Then you read down deeper and it was somebody threw some fireworks in a trash can.
[02:31:37.141 --> 02:31:40.783]  You're going to have all sorts of reports of Al-Qaeda attack in the next few days, folks.
[02:31:41.463 --> 02:31:43.244]  They've got the public so cowardly.
[02:31:43.745 --> 02:31:47.647]  You're 400 times more likely to die in a car wreck than to be killed by terrorists.
[02:31:47.667 --> 02:31:49.008]  That's what 9-11 averaged in.
[02:31:49.068 --> 02:31:50.248]  It's basically impossible.
[02:31:50.288 --> 02:31:52.250]  It's unknown if it wasn't for 9-11.
[02:31:53.823 --> 02:31:55.865]  And those numbers they average in.
[02:31:56.686 --> 02:31:57.467]  And they don't care.
[02:31:57.487 --> 02:32:03.333]  Just a public running around, cowering in fear, flopping around on their backs, begging anyone in a black uniform to save them.
[02:32:03.833 --> 02:32:06.056]  You better watch the folks in black uniforms.
[02:32:06.096 --> 02:32:07.057]  That's what history shows.
[02:32:09.359 --> 02:32:11.902]  But at first the police said that it blew up a big
[02:32:12.975 --> 02:32:16.137]  Garbage dump and that was splashed all over TV in the last 20 minutes.
[02:32:16.517 --> 02:32:19.099]  Al-Qaeda hits and they hit hard.
[02:32:19.739 --> 02:32:22.220]  It blew the trash dump to pieces.
[02:32:22.341 --> 02:32:26.703]  An inferno of incredible destruction.
[02:32:26.983 --> 02:32:29.245]  A Fox News alert.
[02:32:29.725 --> 02:32:30.505]  That's just it.
[02:32:30.545 --> 02:32:31.906]  A pipe bomb explodes.
[02:32:31.966 --> 02:32:33.007]  Incredible.
[02:32:33.107 --> 02:32:34.147]  Oh my gosh.
[02:32:34.988 --> 02:32:36.049]  It's so deadly.
[02:32:36.069 --> 02:32:38.330]  Then it turns out
[02:32:39.071 --> 02:32:40.472]  Well, it was a smaller device.
[02:32:40.752 --> 02:32:43.994]  It was a small trash can, uh, and it only damaged it in the next report.
[02:32:44.014 --> 02:32:48.016]  Uh, it may have been some firecrackers and there was some smoke.
[02:32:49.657 --> 02:32:53.139]  Oh my gosh, in an alley, some people set off some fireworks!
[02:32:53.339 --> 02:32:54.000]  No!
[02:32:54.420 --> 02:32:55.320]  Oh, please!
[02:32:55.721 --> 02:32:57.021]  Take all my freedom!
[02:32:57.081 --> 02:32:58.502]  No!
[02:32:58.722 --> 02:33:01.344]  Oh, the firecrackers!
[02:33:01.444 --> 02:33:02.404]  Please, no!
[02:33:03.265 --> 02:33:04.166]  Not Al-Qaeda!
[02:33:07.196 --> 02:33:14.483]  Meanwhile, the banks are totally devaluing the currency, the country's plunging, the borders are completely wide open, and the sovereignties are just totally dying.
[02:33:14.523 --> 02:33:15.444]  But that's not a problem.
[02:33:16.945 --> 02:33:22.290]  Cops are beating innocent people up coast to coast, they're framing folks industrially everywhere.
[02:33:22.310 --> 02:33:26.333]  I mean, it's just... I can't even get into the police corruption and city corruption.
[02:33:26.373 --> 02:33:31.338]  It's so off the chart, it's not even to be... It's... it's... it's... it's fathomless.
[02:33:34.167 --> 02:33:34.848]  What's happening?
[02:33:35.328 --> 02:33:36.329]  I know we got a bunch of calls.
[02:33:36.349 --> 02:33:37.870]  I also want to get into these famous quotes.
[02:33:38.410 --> 02:33:42.694]  Let me get into the famous quotes here in just a moment.
[02:33:42.714 --> 02:33:43.894]  I'm not going to read too many of these.
[02:33:43.914 --> 02:33:50.820]  Maybe I should just have like a whole day, a whole show where... No, no, no.
[02:33:50.880 --> 02:33:53.302]  This is a write-up on China.
[02:33:54.923 --> 02:33:58.025]  The quotes I need is a bit... There's a big stack in there.
[02:33:58.065 --> 02:33:59.326]  This is a voiceover for Endgame.
[02:33:59.967 --> 02:34:01.228]  There's a stack in there of
[02:34:03.726 --> 02:34:07.149]  Founding Father quotes and there's another New World Order quote stack.
[02:34:07.169 --> 02:34:08.050]  Ah, it doesn't matter.
[02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:11.933]  I'll have to get up and wander off, I guess, on air to find it.
[02:34:12.574 --> 02:34:17.178]  I want to tell you about a couple sponsors here.
[02:34:18.799 --> 02:34:20.100]  One of them is eFoods Direct.
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:21.802]  I've got a year's supply of food from them.
[02:34:21.842 --> 02:34:25.265]  It's excellent, high quality, clean food, 99% organic.
[02:34:25.565 --> 02:34:27.887]  I can't say 100% because I have to get all these extra certifications.
[02:34:27.907 --> 02:34:27.927]  3-3.
[02:34:27.947 --> 02:34:28.227]  Last 10 years,
[02:34:30.746 --> 02:34:34.808]  And it's just wonderful stuff and this is how they control us with food.
[02:34:35.209 --> 02:34:36.409]  That's how tyranny is going to get you.
[02:34:36.429 --> 02:34:41.172]  They can shut the economy down, and they've done this before, and just type food as a weapon into Google.
[02:34:41.212 --> 02:34:43.233]  You can read all about it, what our government says they'll do.
[02:34:43.693 --> 02:34:46.175]  You need to get at least a year's supply of food for every member of your family.
[02:34:46.195 --> 02:34:48.416]  800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:34:48.456 --> 02:34:48.696]  Great folks.
[02:34:56.204 --> 02:34:59.566]  And you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:34:59.586 --> 02:35:01.147]  I love that catchphrase because it's true.
[02:35:01.867 --> 02:35:06.250]  And I've got three different waves of affordable food I've got, going back eight years.
[02:35:06.350 --> 02:35:08.251]  Well, I just got some more from eFoodsDirect.
[02:35:08.271 --> 02:35:14.994]  They are the name, longest continual company in the nation, 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:35:16.075 --> 02:35:19.657]  I mean, now, obviously, is the time to make those type of purchases.
[02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:22.558]  It doesn't mean you may not ever use it, but you can eat that insurance.
[02:35:22.939 --> 02:35:23.919]  You can eat that investment.
[02:35:24.860 --> 02:35:25.400]  It's good stuff.
[02:35:25.993 --> 02:35:28.935]  Then, of course, there's also Researched Herbs with a great product line.
[02:35:29.416 --> 02:35:38.102]  One of their many products, well-documented, well-known, you know, these are well-researched, hence researchedherbs.com, is LIB52.

[02:36:15.570 --> 02:36:16.550]  I've really plugged since then.
[02:36:34.279 --> 02:36:35.100]  I don't know what to say.
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:37.321]  I've got a great website, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:36:37.421 --> 02:36:38.902]  I want to thank all of you that are members.

[02:36:49.389 --> 02:36:51.250]  It is an armory of resistance.
[02:36:51.350 --> 02:36:51.610]  It is a
[02:36:54.759 --> 02:36:57.401]  Oh, what's the term they always call people who've got more than five guns?
[02:36:57.461 --> 02:36:58.162]  An arsenal.
[02:36:58.442 --> 02:37:00.664]  But it's a real arsenal in the Info Wars.
[02:37:01.505 --> 02:37:03.146]  Go there, whatever topic, it's there.

[02:37:14.275 --> 02:37:16.597]  This is... this is... this is...
[02:37:17.225 --> 02:37:17.745]  Two books.
[02:37:17.926 --> 02:37:18.406]  All that stuff.

[02:37:52.039 --> 02:37:52.439]  Thank you.
[02:37:52.479 --> 02:37:53.560]  We couldn't operate without you.
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:55.121]  It pays the bills.
[02:37:56.282 --> 02:37:56.822]  Just barely.
[02:37:56.862 --> 02:37:58.103]  The summer is always a tough time.
[02:37:59.524 --> 02:38:02.146]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:38:02.326 --> 02:38:03.427]  We've added bigger servers.
[02:38:03.667 --> 02:38:04.928]  I'm even going to add more servers.
[02:38:05.658 --> 02:38:09.501]  Servers that cost like three or four thousand dollars a month on top of everything I've already got.
[02:38:09.522 --> 02:38:11.123]  I've already got like six or seven servers.
[02:38:11.163 --> 02:38:14.646]  I mean it's it's expensive folks to pay for all this.
[02:38:14.666 --> 02:38:15.647]  That's where all the money goes.
[02:38:16.548 --> 02:38:20.391]  But keep supporting us because we're having a big effect.

[02:38:39.725 --> 02:38:41.408]  Okay, I want to read famous quotes here.
[02:38:52.327 --> 02:38:53.927]  I want to read some famous quotes.
[02:38:54.187 --> 02:38:55.308]  Oh, by the way, I forgot about Israel.
[02:38:55.328 --> 02:38:59.689]  They also got caught in the 80s staging a fake attack on their British embassy.
[02:38:59.709 --> 02:39:00.569]  That's mainstream news.
[02:39:00.609 --> 02:39:01.409]  I just thought I'd throw that in.
[02:39:01.669 --> 02:39:09.371]  The British have been caught staging firecracker attacks on embassies, too, when they, quote, want to increase security to, quote, get the local government to pay more attention.
[02:39:09.651 --> 02:39:12.632]  That's probably what this... This is either kids with a firecracker or that.
[02:39:13.012 --> 02:39:13.692]  Probably kids.
[02:39:14.352 --> 02:39:15.813]  It was an Al-Qaeda hit!
[02:39:18.979 --> 02:39:24.882]  They'll probably say bottle rockets or missiles or roman candles or laser beams.
[02:39:24.982 --> 02:39:28.503]  I saw a flying saucer with bin Laden flying it.
[02:39:28.783 --> 02:39:30.044]  He was going to attack me.
[02:39:30.424 --> 02:39:33.905]  I just want more cops in black masks to run checkpoints but not at the border.
[02:39:34.146 --> 02:39:35.246]  Keep me safe!
[02:39:35.286 --> 02:39:41.489]  Let me read you some quotes because these are important.
[02:39:42.289 --> 02:39:44.230]  Now there's hundreds of these but I'm going to read Carol quickly.
[02:39:44.290 --> 02:39:45.170]  I started these yesterday.
[02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:46.751]  I never got to all of them on the Sunday show.
[02:39:49.025 --> 02:39:50.566]  I'm thinking about taking off tomorrow.
[02:39:51.287 --> 02:39:52.087]  I may not do it now.
[02:40:20.856 --> 02:40:22.618]  Again, he went on to establish NASA.
[02:40:23.879 --> 02:40:32.746]  He was a scientist, degreed scientist, who applied, who also had a Master's, or I guess PhD in History, and applied scientific approach to history.
[02:40:33.006 --> 02:40:34.487]  Very cold-bloodedly, by the way.
[02:40:34.507 --> 02:40:39.071]  And he was allowed into the Globalist Archives, the Bilderberg Archives, for two years.
[02:40:40.312 --> 02:40:47.558]  And by the way, last time I was rereading some of it, because we were shooting video of the pages, and it was just every page, especially once you get to like page 950,
[02:40:48.937 --> 02:40:50.858]  It's just exactly how everything runs.
[02:40:51.138 --> 02:40:56.842]  He's got how the British funded Hitler, so he'd blow everything up and tear everything up.
[02:40:56.862 --> 02:40:58.343]  I mean, it's just all there, man!
[02:40:58.583 --> 02:41:00.564]  These people don't play games!
[02:41:00.864 --> 02:41:03.286]  They're in control because they're ruthless, okay?
[02:41:05.327 --> 02:41:09.089]  And they're behind these Muslim terrorists, you can absolutely guarantee it.
[02:41:11.171 --> 02:41:16.674]  Quotes, there does exist and has existed for a generation an international anglophile network.
[02:41:17.794 --> 02:41:21.695]  Which operates, to some extent, in the way the radical right believes the communist act.
[02:41:21.715 --> 02:41:32.739]  In fact, this network, which may identify as the Roundtable, which we may identify as the Roundtable groups, has no aversion to cooperating with the communists, or any other groups, and frequently does so.
[02:41:33.379 --> 02:41:37.281]  I know of its operations of this network, because I have studied it for nearly 20 years.
[02:41:38.462 --> 02:41:43.565]  And was permitted for two years in the early 1960s to examine its papers and secret records.
[02:41:44.105 --> 02:41:49.769]  I have no aversion to it or most of its aims and have, for much of my life, been close to it and many of its instruments.
[02:41:50.329 --> 02:41:55.492]  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies.
[02:41:56.032 --> 02:42:04.197]  In general, my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.
[02:42:05.831 --> 02:42:10.572]  The argument that the two parties should... Now that's from Tragedy and Hope, page 950.
[02:42:11.413 --> 02:42:12.733]  Here's 1247.
[02:42:14.253 --> 02:42:33.139]  The argument that the two parties should represent opposing ideals and policies, one, perhaps of the right and the other of the left, is a foolish idea acceptable only to the... only to the doctor-tative and the doctor-tare and the academic thinkers.
[02:42:33.857 --> 02:42:45.432]  Instead, the two parties should be almost identical, so that the American public can, quote, throw the rascals out at any election without leading to any profound or extreme shifts of policy.
[02:42:46.653 --> 02:42:51.680]  So even by the 60s, when he wrote this, late 60s, you know, they're saying, there's no difference, folks.
[02:42:52.629 --> 02:42:53.970]  It's only on the surface.
[02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:55.090]  They vacation together.
[02:42:55.130 --> 02:42:56.271]  They have investments together.
[02:42:56.291 --> 02:43:04.034]  There's some real fighting, but only over petty issues to see who gets to be the minions or the button pushers.
[02:43:04.054 --> 02:43:05.574]  They're just button pushers in Congress.
[02:43:08.355 --> 02:43:09.816]  I mean, this is on the record.
[02:43:11.557 --> 02:43:12.377]  But you've got
[02:43:15.299 --> 02:43:35.226]  The doctoratare and the academic who are just in their own little doctrines, their own little... And man, they've got all these complex algorithms and discussions and it's all in a false matrix of just discussing... It's like going to a Shakespearean play and discussing the real life of the players as if the play is a real world.
[02:43:36.507 --> 02:43:37.647]  It's like Dungeons and Dragons.
[02:43:37.707 --> 02:43:41.788]  I mean, there's people who have whole universes built up in their heads about their D&D pieces.
[02:43:42.429 --> 02:43:43.529]  Or their fantasy football.
[02:43:44.750 --> 02:43:46.272]  And they'll get in fistfights over it.
[02:43:46.572 --> 02:43:48.594]  People commit suicide over fantasy football.
[02:43:49.015 --> 02:43:50.116]  It ain't real, man!
[02:43:50.136 --> 02:43:51.498]  Okay?
[02:43:51.558 --> 02:43:52.979]  It is not real!
[02:43:53.420 --> 02:43:56.063]  What does it take to get it through your head?
[02:43:56.323 --> 02:43:58.646]  It isn't, oh, they're pretty similar, or oh... No!
[02:43:58.726 --> 02:44:00.167]  They vacation together!
[02:44:00.408 --> 02:44:01.269]  They live together!
[02:44:01.449 --> 02:44:02.410]  They're married!
[02:44:03.311 --> 02:44:04.132]  It's mafia!
[02:44:06.164 --> 02:44:21.050]  Look at families where the wife, like Mary Madeline, is a Republican, and then Carville's the Democrat, where you've got the two Bennett brothers, one's a liberal, one's a conservative, because when you've got families that are raised into all this, they can't have both of them, so they split them up!
[02:44:21.650 --> 02:44:23.451]  It is totally staged!
[02:44:23.651 --> 02:44:24.611]  Do you understand that?
[02:44:24.831 --> 02:44:26.532]  Completely staged!
[02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:40.058]  The powers of financial capitalism had another far-reaching aim, nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands, able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole.
[02:44:40.879 --> 02:44:47.144]  The system was to be controlled as a feudalist... Where's my next page?
[02:44:47.184 --> 02:44:47.464]  Here it is.
[02:44:47.924 --> 02:44:56.630]  Feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world, acting in concert by secret arrangements, arrived at frequent private meetings and conferences.
[02:44:57.011 --> 02:44:57.411]  Bilderberg.
[02:44:58.735 --> 02:45:02.458]  The apex of the system was to be the Bank of International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
[02:45:02.718 --> 02:45:04.340]  They're the folks saying we're going into a depression.
[02:45:05.581 --> 02:45:07.422]  A private, which means they want that to happen.
[02:45:07.603 --> 02:45:09.324]  They got a needle out trying to pop the bottle.
[02:45:09.564 --> 02:45:11.266]  Pop, pop, pop.
[02:45:12.146 --> 02:45:18.932]  And we're so irrational and so brainwashed it's actually, people have such irrational exuberance it's actually that they trained us to have to get into debt.
[02:45:19.212 --> 02:45:21.214]  Now they're like, well now we're saying don't be.
[02:45:21.715 --> 02:45:24.177]  Their propaganda works so good it's not even working.
[02:45:25.778 --> 02:45:26.859]  You gotta love it sometimes.
[02:45:27.549 --> 02:45:28.910]  They did too good a job.
[02:45:29.310 --> 02:45:40.639]  The apex of the system was to be the Bank of International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, a private bank owned and controlled by the world's central banks, which themselves are private corporations.
[02:45:41.179 --> 02:45:56.111]  Each central bank sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans, to manipulate foreign exchange rates, to influence the level of economic activity in the country, and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world.
[02:45:57.990 --> 02:45:59.211]  That's from Tragedy and Hope.
[02:46:00.292 --> 02:46:04.656]  And then they've got two quotes here from the Anglo-American Establishment.
[02:46:05.116 --> 02:46:07.618]  Now they broke the plates on the other book and got real mad at it.
[02:46:07.638 --> 02:46:12.422]  The Anglo-American Establishment, I read many years ago, it's got an American flag in the middle of a British flag.
[02:46:13.823 --> 02:46:17.866]  It is a little more propagandistic, but it admits a lot of truths.
[02:46:18.487 --> 02:46:19.688]  And it's long quotes here.
[02:46:19.868 --> 02:46:20.749]  This is from Wikipedia.
[02:46:20.769 --> 02:46:22.911]  I actually own both the books, and these are real quotes.
[02:46:22.931 --> 02:46:23.631]  I mean, I have the books.
[02:46:24.512 --> 02:46:25.693]  You can read this on Wikipedia.
[02:46:26.377 --> 02:46:32.681]  And it talks about how the British government had reached a fantastic idea that they could kill two birds with one stone.
[02:46:33.802 --> 02:46:35.663]  And it goes on to say how they set up Germany.
[02:46:35.683 --> 02:46:38.425]  Let me find the exact quotes here.
[02:46:39.706 --> 02:46:41.027]  They funded Hitler.
[02:46:41.067 --> 02:46:41.527]  Let me see.
[02:46:42.768 --> 02:46:43.688]  Oh, it's too long a quote.
[02:46:43.728 --> 02:46:44.729]  Just go read it for yourself.
[02:46:46.348 --> 02:46:48.190]  You can go read this for yourself.
[02:46:48.730 --> 02:46:49.170]  Listen to this.
[02:46:49.531 --> 02:46:53.634]  No country that values its safety should allow what the Milner Group accomplished in Britain.
[02:46:54.074 --> 02:47:03.342]  That is, that a small number of men should be able to wield such power in administration and politics, should be given almost complete control over the publication of the documents relating to their actions.
[02:47:03.842 --> 02:47:07.165]  See, he's all for elitism, but he says you've got to watch the elite.
[02:47:07.205 --> 02:47:08.766]  The elite has to regulate itself better.
[02:47:09.086 --> 02:47:10.607]  And they adopted what Quigley said.
[02:47:10.727 --> 02:47:13.950]  They all have, quote, transparency now, and they do watch each other now.
[02:47:14.679 --> 02:47:18.522]  Because see what happens is these guys are such crooks they always run wild personally.
[02:47:19.042 --> 02:47:29.690]  He said, we should be able to exercise such influence over the avenues of information and create public opinion and should be able to monopolize so complete the writing and teaching of history of their own period.
[02:47:31.252 --> 02:47:40.719]  And again it goes into the events of 36 by which Hitler re-militarized the Rhineland was the most crucial event in the whole of history.
[02:47:42.111 --> 02:48:00.897]  of appeasement, so long as the territory west of the Rhine and a strip of 50 kilometers on the west bank of the river were demilitarized, and provided in the Treaty of Versailles, and the Locarno Pacts, Hitler would never have dared to move against Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland.
[02:48:01.257 --> 02:48:05.158]  He would not have dared because when Western Germany, unfortified and
[02:48:06.664 --> 02:48:14.866]  Denied of German soldiers, France could have easily driven into the Ruhr industrial area and crippled Germany so that it would be impossible to go eastward.
[02:48:15.686 --> 02:48:27.009]  And by that date, certain members of the Milner Group, that's the Bank of London folks, of the British Conservative government had reached a fantastic idea, we'll come back and finish this, to get into how they set up Hitler.
[02:48:28.949 --> 02:48:33.310]  Just like they run all the Pakistanis, they're got out running around blowing stuff up.
[02:48:34.858 --> 02:48:35.719]  That's why they win.
[02:48:36.019 --> 02:48:36.680]  They're ruthless.
[02:48:37.380 --> 02:48:38.821]  And you buy into it.
[02:48:38.861 --> 02:48:40.222]  James Bond's a terrorist.
[02:48:42.484 --> 02:48:45.627]  It's here.
[02:48:45.827 --> 02:48:50.611]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:50.971 --> 02:48:58.617]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.309 --> 02:49:06.354]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:06.754 --> 02:49:18.181]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.501 --> 02:49:22.004]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.464 --> 02:49:24.425]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:24.725 --> 02:49:28.568]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:44.870 --> 02:49:47.652]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:47.932 --> 02:49:52.075]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:52.515 --> 02:49:53.356]  So what do you do?
[02:49:53.656 --> 02:49:58.219]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:49:58.699 --> 02:50:00.821]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:01.321 --> 02:50:16.011]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:16.051 --> 02:50:23.116]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:50:41.829 --> 02:50:43.549]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:43.769 --> 02:50:47.470]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:47.790 --> 02:50:49.990]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:50.510 --> 02:50:56.712]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:50:56.872 --> 02:51:01.772]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:01.972 --> 02:51:10.934]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:11.334 --> 02:51:17.335]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[02:51:43.784 --> 02:51:45.125]  Look, we're out of time.
[02:51:45.185 --> 02:51:48.869]  I know I got loaded phone lines and I let you down.
[02:51:48.889 --> 02:51:53.172]  But we'll take your calls tomorrow and the next day.
[02:52:09.398 --> 02:52:19.164]  We'll keep going as long as we can, until our loving government sets off nukes, or whatever they're gonna do, and then we'll see him in suits, address the country with a tear in his eye, and we'll all learn to love him again.
[02:52:20.745 --> 02:52:21.786]  Learn to love our leader.
[02:52:21.806 --> 02:52:25.848]  Oh, it's so nice to have such leaders.
[02:52:26.409 --> 02:52:27.569]  Thought I'd read a few more quotes.
[02:52:27.589 --> 02:52:29.130]  I mean, there's literally thousands of these.
[02:52:29.150 --> 02:52:34.634]  But in the event I'm reincarnated, I would like to return as a
[02:52:35.709 --> 02:52:38.931]  Deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.
[02:52:39.351 --> 02:52:41.492]  His Royal Highness Prince Philip.
[02:52:45.315 --> 02:52:47.416]  And that was in the French News Agency.
[02:52:48.716 --> 02:52:50.437]  I've got Audubon Magazine.
[02:52:50.477 --> 02:52:53.979]  A world population of 250 million to 300 million people.
[02:52:54.039 --> 02:52:57.241]  A 95% decline from present levels would be ideal.
[02:52:57.822 --> 02:52:58.422]  Ted Turner.
[02:52:59.343 --> 02:53:05.146]  But then he doesn't want the black children to die and he gives a billion dollars for special injections.
[02:53:05.973 --> 02:53:07.335]  Can you put two and two together?
[02:53:08.856 --> 02:53:12.861]  With some African countries, half of them have AIDS now, or whatever that weapon is they're using on them.
[02:53:12.881 --> 02:53:15.384]  They've caught them putting sterilization hormones in the shots.
[02:53:15.764 --> 02:53:16.505]  Let's just try.
[02:53:16.525 --> 02:53:18.928]  They wouldn't hurt 3,000 of us on 9-11.
[02:53:19.048 --> 02:53:23.573]  It's just, every writing they write, they say they want to kill us, but they don't.
[02:53:24.354 --> 02:53:25.496]  They're good, though.
[02:53:26.570 --> 02:53:31.312]  They're so upset they're going to take all our rides because some people are burning some cars!
[02:53:31.332 --> 02:53:33.193]  I mean, firecrackers are going off!
[02:53:33.453 --> 02:53:36.635]  We have to give up all our rides because they just don't want us to get hurt!
[02:53:37.375 --> 02:53:38.796]  They love us so much!
[02:53:41.077 --> 02:53:43.598]  We are on the verge of a global transformation.
[02:53:43.678 --> 02:53:47.940]  All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.
[02:53:50.370 --> 02:53:55.740]  It is the sacred principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter to which the American people will henceforth pledge their allegiance.
[02:53:56.241 --> 02:54:00.648]  President George W. Bush, addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, February 1st, 1990.
[02:54:02.563 --> 02:54:12.489]  But this present window of opportunity during which a truly peaceful, that means everyone enslaved, and independent world order might be built will not be open for long.
[02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:21.114]  Already there are powerful forces at work that threaten to destroy all our hopes and efforts to erect an enduring structure of global interdependence.
[02:54:21.635 --> 02:54:26.878]  David Rockefeller speaking to the Business Council for the United Nations, September 14th, 1994 on C-SPAN.
[02:54:29.224 --> 02:54:31.966]  In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete.
[02:54:32.506 --> 02:54:34.867]  All states will recognize a single global authority.
[02:54:35.328 --> 02:54:40.250]  National sovereignty and all the freedoms that go with it, I added, wasn't such a great idea.
[02:54:40.390 --> 02:54:46.314]  After all, Strobe Talbot, President Clinton's Deputy Secretary of State, has quoted in Time Magazine, July 20th, 1992.
[02:54:48.455 --> 02:54:53.418]  We shall have world government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent.
[02:54:54.568 --> 02:54:57.330]  Statement by Council on Foreign Relations C.F.R.
[02:54:57.390 --> 02:55:01.614]  member James Warburg to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17, 1950.
[02:55:02.234 --> 02:55:07.098]  And I interviewed people, staffers, who were there.
[02:55:07.158 --> 02:55:09.300]  One of the fellows, I forget his name, he just died a few years ago.
[02:55:09.360 --> 02:55:10.541]  He was there when that happened.
[02:55:10.921 --> 02:55:13.203]  And Warburg pointed his finger right at them.
[02:55:13.463 --> 02:55:14.224]  Can you imagine?
[02:55:15.005 --> 02:55:17.847]  We shall have world government whether or not you like it!
[02:55:19.328 --> 02:55:21.110]  By conquest or consent.
[02:55:21.150 --> 02:55:23.992]  Just, let me tell you, there was a little bit of resistance still then.
[02:55:24.662 --> 02:55:33.424]  We're going to have it whether or not you like it.
[02:55:33.684 --> 02:55:35.545]  Bill Clinton said this on MTV.
[02:55:36.005 --> 02:55:43.386]  When we got organized as a country, we wrote a fairly radical constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans.
[02:55:43.766 --> 02:55:45.847]  And so a lot of people say there's too much personal freedom.
[02:55:47.330 --> 02:55:49.971]  When personal freedom is being abused, you have to move to limit it.
[02:55:50.371 --> 02:55:58.534]  That's what we did with the announcement I made last week on the public housing projects, about how we're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that, try to make people safer in their communities.
[02:55:58.954 --> 02:56:00.515]  President Bill Clinton, March 22nd, 1994.
[02:56:02.315 --> 02:56:05.737]  We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans.
[02:56:06.157 --> 02:56:07.877]  Bill Clinton, USA Today, March 11th, 1993, page 2A.
[02:56:11.716 --> 02:56:14.139]  If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:56:14.219 --> 02:56:19.446]  Just so long as, heh heh heh, I'm the dictator, George Bush, December 18, 2000, CNN.
[02:56:19.786 --> 02:56:20.727]  God bless you all!
