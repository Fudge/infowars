[00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:06.250]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.971]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:09.812]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.453 --> 00:00:11.253]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.014 --> 00:00:12.914]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.595 --> 00:00:17.277]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.778 --> 00:00:21.901]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:33.129]  A lot has happened.
[00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:34.350]  A lot is happening.
[00:00:35.715 --> 00:00:36.535]  In our world.
[00:00:39.457 --> 00:00:42.718]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:43.758 --> 00:00:46.800]  It is already Friday, ladies and gentlemen, the 22nd day of June 2007.
[00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.040]  We have a big news day lined up for you.
[00:00:53.451 --> 00:00:58.973]  Also, we're going to have open phones throughout the three hours of the broadcast.
[00:00:58.993 --> 00:01:04.074]  We only have one guest, many guests, joining us later in the second hour.
[00:01:04.735 --> 00:01:14.998]  The toll-free number to join us, whether you want to talk about the Brown ongoing standoff in New Hampshire and some new developments there, or the ongoing saber-rattling for the attack on Iran, the U.S.
[00:01:15.038 --> 00:01:20.940]  and Israel, announcing earlier this week they finalized their bombardment plans for the country.
[00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.451]  The CIA is now saying they're to air decades of dirty laundry.
[00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:27.071]  That'll be decades of whitewashes.
[00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:28.291]  Or who knows?
[00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:30.592]  They might release some more Northwoods documents about U.S.
[00:01:30.612 --> 00:01:34.113]  government plans to carry out terror attacks against the American people.
[00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:35.253]  Who knows?
[00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:51.216]  Also, we will get into some more of the global warming fear-mongering that's going on, and the open public assault now on talk radio, the Internet, any venue where you might
[00:01:51.972 --> 00:02:04.284]  I have some type of free speech that can truly be engaged in, uncensored and unwashed and unpolished by the New York and London as well as Los Angeles propaganda masters.
[00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:14.254]  That is all coming up today in the next three hours and much more, but I always love just having open phones because it's like the Wheel of Fortune, you spin it,
[00:02:15.047 --> 00:02:22.312]  And it's just, callers bring up issues that are so important, so interesting, with so many different angles and facets.
[00:02:22.972 --> 00:02:27.275]  And we're going to be taking calls throughout the three hours of airtime today at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:27.295 --> 00:02:27.455]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:27.476 --> 00:02:30.778]  I want to thank everybody that came out to Brave New Books here in Austin.
[00:02:39.272 --> 00:02:47.035]  Two days ago, everybody that came out for the sneak peek of Endgame last night, if you saw the first hour of the film, tell me what you thought of it.
[00:02:49.196 --> 00:02:54.718]  My wife saw it, and she's seen clips of it, but she hasn't seen what we've done together all at one time.
[00:02:54.738 --> 00:02:58.739]  She said that she understood the history, but we might need to make it clear when we shift
[00:02:59.486 --> 00:02:59.926]  I don't think so.
[00:03:12.905 --> 00:03:13.306]  We're good to go.
[00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:34.287]  You're raising that point, and because I do want to get your feedback.
[00:03:34.347 --> 00:03:50.093]  I did get quite a bit of your feedback last night, but not as much as I would have wanted to, because the people asking questions had questions about other issues and questions about what's happening in the world, not just with the film and the limited spectrum of information that it focuses on.
[00:03:52.276 --> 00:03:55.778]  So we'll be taking your calls on that subject as well.
[00:03:56.638 --> 00:03:58.459]  Yes, I didn't talk about it Wednesday.
[00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.880]  I mentioned it yesterday on air Thursday.
[00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:07.783]  Really, one of the top documentary filmmakers in the world was here in town.
[00:04:08.443 --> 00:04:09.324]  He's in the top tier.
[00:04:09.704 --> 00:04:11.385]  I would say right below Michael Moore.
[00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:18.068]  And of course, their first big film was Brothers Keeper, which I remember seeing on PBS six, seven years ago that just blew me away.
[00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.349]  We're good to go.
[00:04:40.954 --> 00:04:44.217]  When they first called me a few weeks ago, I'm sick of doing TV interviews.
[00:04:44.277 --> 00:04:47.461]  I told them no and hung up the phone on them before they told me who they were.
[00:04:47.481 --> 00:04:49.243]  Because I'm trying to finish the endgame.
[00:04:49.684 --> 00:04:53.768]  But I'm really glad that they called back and I had a chance to get to know them.
[00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:55.350]  I'm glad I did it.
[00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.111]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:04.369 --> 00:05:09.855]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:17.824]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.556 --> 00:05:25.579]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:37.424]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.724 --> 00:05:41.245]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.705 --> 00:05:43.626]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.966 --> 00:05:47.808]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:48.388 --> 00:05:55.397]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.443 --> 00:06:06.669]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:14.918]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:06:15.158 --> 00:06:22.226]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:06:22.386 --> 00:06:23.667]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:29.652]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:06:29.832 --> 00:06:34.936]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:06:35.036 --> 00:06:43.924]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:06:44.184 --> 00:06:47.486]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:06:49.648 --> 00:06:53.570]  I need to get my feet in shape for summer!
[00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:56.592]  But every time I get a pedicure, my feet look great.
[00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:10.050]  For a while, anyway.
[00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:13.734]  Then I have to go right back again because they get dry so quickly.
[00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.677]  Listen, haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:07:16.978 --> 00:07:20.481]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:07:20.842 --> 00:07:23.124]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:07:23.664 --> 00:07:24.365]  What's the name again?
[00:07:24.385 --> 00:07:25.747]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:07:26.147 --> 00:07:26.968]  It's CalX.
[00:07:27.188 --> 00:07:27.468]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:07:29.813 --> 00:07:31.474]  What makes Kallax Ointment so different?
[00:07:31.695 --> 00:07:40.041]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:07:41.042 --> 00:07:45.626]  For soft, silky feet that look great in sandals, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Kallax Ointment.
[00:07:45.826 --> 00:07:54.933]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Car Drug, H-E-B Grocery Stores, Medicine Shop Pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:07:55.653 --> 00:07:56.754]  Hey, there's a drug store!
[00:07:56.814 --> 00:07:57.475]  I'll be right back.
[00:07:57.735 --> 00:07:58.676]  I'm getting some Kallax.
[00:08:01.345 --> 00:08:06.868]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.515 --> 00:08:34.896]  Alright, I said we're going to have open phones today, and we're going to do it.
[00:08:35.116 --> 00:08:42.978]  We're going to go to your calls right now at 1-800-259-9231, and we will cover all the latest global warming, taxation, hysteria.
[00:08:43.578 --> 00:08:48.139]  We will get into the open preparations for war against Iran between Israel and the United States.
[00:08:48.959 --> 00:08:51.299]  We will cover some new developments at the Brown property.
[00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:54.440]  Brown Sympathizer arrested after sending an email.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:00.161]  Also, CIA to air decades of its dirty laundry, and much, much more.
[00:09:01.249 --> 00:09:03.591]  It's all coming up today.
[00:09:05.172 --> 00:09:06.574]  Right now, let's go to the calls.
[00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:09.516]  John in Texas.
[00:09:09.676 --> 00:09:10.477]  You're on the air.
[00:09:10.577 --> 00:09:10.977]  Welcome.
[00:09:11.718 --> 00:09:12.138]  Hi, Alex.
[00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:12.979]  Hi.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.884]  I want to talk, say that I think I have a slight advantage on you, that I was born in 1949.
[00:09:19.004 --> 00:09:23.648]  And the America that I grew up in, the 1950s and early 60s, is dead.
[00:09:27.162 --> 00:09:31.204]  I tell people we used to take our cap guns to school and play cowboys and Indians.
[00:09:31.224 --> 00:09:35.106]  We used to have snowball fights and the teachers used to get out there and have snowball fights with us.
[00:09:36.327 --> 00:09:41.589]  The fact that my dad made $100 a week and we supported a whole family.
[00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:44.671]  We had a three bedroom house and an acre and a half of land.
[00:09:44.931 --> 00:09:49.093]  My mother stayed home and all the other mothers stayed home to take care of the kids.
[00:09:50.153 --> 00:09:50.954]  That's all gone.
[00:09:51.394 --> 00:09:52.254]  It didn't die.
[00:09:52.274 --> 00:09:52.835]  It's been murdered.
[00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:53.235]  What happened?
[00:09:57.452 --> 00:10:18.333]  By design, they went into our normal tribal society, operating as human beings have been operating for tens of thousands of years, and they scientifically, with psychiatrists and sociologists and anthropologists, scientifically ripped it limb from limb with premeditated avarice and extreme pleasure.
[00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:21.040]  And you can see the police, I mean, we're going into a police state.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.962]  You can see it all, everything, what's going on in the schools and everything, and the older generations can see this.
[00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.783]  I mean, I don't see why they're so blind.
[00:10:29.164 --> 00:10:37.868]  It's just... Well, they watch the news and the cop shows that create the illusion of all this violence to create fear, but let me expand on all the points you made.
[00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:42.270]  Yeah, I mean, you could make $10,000 a year, $5,000 a year back in the 60s.
[00:10:46.094 --> 00:10:51.236]  And live in a really nice house, have two cars, go on vacations, put people through college.
[00:10:52.536 --> 00:10:54.957]  The dollar has been completely debased.
[00:10:55.538 --> 00:11:00.239]  It has been completely devalued right in front of our eyes, and the average American doesn't even know what that means.
[00:11:00.659 --> 00:11:03.901]  That's how brainwashed and brain-damaged we've been.
[00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:13.164]  My father would, and this is in the mid-1960s, would, in high school, before he went to college,
[00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:18.017]  Would walk right in with a shotgun into school, stick it in his locker.
[00:11:19.009 --> 00:11:22.572]  And, uh, or they would go get dropped off closer to school and ride in on the bus.
[00:11:22.592 --> 00:11:23.692]  It was a pretty good size school.
[00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:31.918]  And they, you know, would go walk right out the front door of the school and go jump in the back of a pickup truck with their coaches and go shoot quail or doves, whatever.
[00:11:32.418 --> 00:11:34.860]  You didn't have that type of crime, even in the big cities.
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.181]  You didn't have people shooting each other.
[00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:39.243]  It was the mindset that changed.
[00:11:39.283 --> 00:11:40.403]  It was the brainwashing.
[00:11:40.704 --> 00:11:48.469]  And now that we have drills and lockdowns, we do have mass shootings and we have police who stand down every time for an average of three hours plus.
[00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:59.176]  And now, of course, the illegal aliens are all exempt from the laws and exempt from the DWIs and the checkpoints and the driver's license, showing it's all a fraud.
[00:11:59.336 --> 00:12:01.217]  We're all under total control.
[00:12:01.978 --> 00:12:05.600]  And, yeah, we are openly going into complete slavery.
[00:12:06.441 --> 00:12:15.867]  Whereas it took 30, 40 years to bring us from being a free, happy nation to being this enslaved nation, now it's going to just take a few years to take us even deeper into what you'd call hardcore
[00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:17.409]  Tyranny.
[00:12:17.929 --> 00:12:19.970]  And see, first it's you can't play dodgeball.
[00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.230]  You can't give out trophies for who the winners are or who did good.
[00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:27.571]  You can't hurt feelings.
[00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:28.831]  That's the public excuse.
[00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:30.891]  It's about destroying independence.
[00:12:31.352 --> 00:12:32.852]  And oh, now you can't shake hands.
[00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:34.312]  Now you can't have high fives.
[00:12:34.772 --> 00:12:35.952]  Now you can't hug.
[00:12:35.972 --> 00:12:39.813]  You know, a girl wakes up with her boyfriend.
[00:12:39.833 --> 00:12:40.493]  She's crying.
[00:12:40.553 --> 00:12:41.533]  Her friend hugs her.
[00:12:41.973 --> 00:12:43.334]  She goes to jail.
[00:12:43.914 --> 00:12:45.474]  See, it's all zero
[00:12:47.074 --> 00:12:52.899]  Tolerance, or your parents don't know, they send an aspirin to school because you're sick.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:56.982]  In fact, a lot of times when I was a kid, they'd still send me to school, but I just had a little bit of a fever.
[00:12:57.523 --> 00:12:57.943]  Boom!
[00:12:58.203 --> 00:13:00.345]  Oh, we caught you in your lunchbox with some Tylenol.
[00:13:00.826 --> 00:13:02.007]  Jail time!
[00:13:02.027 --> 00:13:07.551]  Or we're going to send you to the criminal school, you know, the juvenile delinquent school.
[00:13:08.172 --> 00:13:15.278]  And then you get in more trouble with basic jail guards watching you, trying to give you demerits to get you in the system.
[00:13:15.758 --> 00:13:17.701]  And then it's all color of law here in Austin.
[00:13:17.721 --> 00:13:18.862]  They don't even have real courts.
[00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:24.148]  They have this family court where they lie and say that three tardies is a criminal absence.
[00:13:25.095 --> 00:13:44.782]  When the state law doesn't even say that, and the judge is screaming them in portable buildings, literally it's a prison system, and then have the parents sign them over to probation through color of law, mass fraud, mass judicial corruption, just wanton evil everywhere, Pentagon-designed cameras scanning our faces, tracking everything we do.
[00:13:45.563 --> 00:13:46.223]  Absolutely.
[00:13:46.803 --> 00:13:48.844]  We've gone from milk and honey
[00:13:49.634 --> 00:14:01.285]  To a happy, free nation, to what we are today, just a knock-kneed, shaking, cowardly public, vowing to men in black uniforms with submachine guns.
[00:14:02.006 --> 00:14:11.475]  If you look at our economy now today, too, when I was a kid you could go to a store and for a nickel you could buy a candy bar, pop with a dime, you could take your girl to the show for a buck fifty, and now what's it cost now?
[00:14:11.555 --> 00:14:14.598]  Man, you almost have to carry a wheelbarrow full of money with you to do anything.
[00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:23.953]  For one person to go and take a date to the movies and buy popcorn, a couple drinks, maybe one thing of candy, $30.
[00:14:24.314 --> 00:14:27.758]  That's a lot of control Alex.
[00:14:27.818 --> 00:14:31.422]  Actually more than that because tickets are now $9 a lot of places.
[00:14:31.462 --> 00:14:32.183]  Let's say on average $8.50.
[00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:45.239]  So we're talking 16, 17 bucks or so for the tickets, and then two drinks is up to about 23, and one candy, 30, and a popcorn, 35 bucks.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.903]  And I can't understand why people can't say, well, how did we get to this?
[00:14:51.063 --> 00:14:53.205]  Why did we go from there to here?
[00:14:53.265 --> 00:14:55.307]  Why they can't put the pieces of the puzzle together?
[00:14:55.467 --> 00:14:56.908]  No, they like black uniforms.
[00:14:56.948 --> 00:14:58.309]  They like 50 million abortions.
[00:14:58.509 --> 00:14:59.450]  They like being slaves.
[00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:00.351]  Yeah.
[00:15:01.171 --> 00:15:02.012]  Well, that's all I got, Alex.
[00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.609]  Thank you.
[00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.630]  Appreciate it, John.
[00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:06.791]  A really good point he made.
[00:15:07.011 --> 00:15:08.912]  And this is how it works.
[00:15:10.813 --> 00:15:12.874]  You see, once you jump off the cliff, you fall.
[00:15:13.034 --> 00:15:14.255]  And now we're almost to the bottom.
[00:15:15.176 --> 00:15:16.817]  And things accelerate from this point.
[00:15:17.637 --> 00:15:28.243]  You see, all the horrible changes you've seen, telescope down the last 50 years, you're going to see more changes in the next 5 years than you've seen in the last 50.
[00:15:30.729 --> 00:15:34.372]  And then you'll see more change in the next 5 years after that than you've seen in the 50 before it.
[00:15:36.934 --> 00:15:38.276]  And it's going to get bad.
[00:15:40.037 --> 00:15:45.562]  You see, because just 10 years ago, that dollar had about 25% of the value it had in 1913.
[00:15:45.602 --> 00:15:46.002]  Now it's gone.
[00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.912]  In actual devaluation, less than one cent.
[00:15:54.952 --> 00:15:56.792]  Ron Paul will say three, four cents.
[00:15:57.192 --> 00:15:58.532]  That's a five, six year old number.
[00:15:58.572 --> 00:15:59.472]  He's very conservative.
[00:15:59.512 --> 00:16:02.133]  No, it's less than one cent.
[00:16:02.153 --> 00:16:03.453]  But let's say it's four cents.
[00:16:04.813 --> 00:16:07.134]  That was all done by design.
[00:16:08.034 --> 00:16:16.576]  And they devalued the dollar globally by half against the pound, close to half against the euro, since Bush got into office.
[00:16:16.996 --> 00:16:18.176]  Public decision was made.
[00:16:18.196 --> 00:16:18.876]  It was announced.
[00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:36.686]  By the Treasury Secretary, of the second Secretary he got in, O'Neill really wasn't going along with it, that occasionally happens, and so they give you a 5, 6, 7, 8 percent tax cut depending on which bracket you're in, but they
[00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:40.631]  Would you rather have that tax cut or would you rather not have your money devalued by half?
[00:16:41.091 --> 00:16:42.612]  I don't know if people can still do the math.
[00:16:42.952 --> 00:16:45.874]  I know yuppies do the little smile and they stick their tongue out between their teeth.
[00:16:45.914 --> 00:16:46.454]  I mean, I've seen it.
[00:16:46.494 --> 00:16:48.235]  It's like a trained brainwashing thing.
[00:16:48.255 --> 00:16:49.476]  They go, ooh, and they'll laugh.
[00:16:49.496 --> 00:16:50.156]  You tell them that.
[00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:51.837]  They'll go, ooh, sure, ooh.
[00:16:52.398 --> 00:16:55.379]  And they stick their tongue out like, just a little bit.
[00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:56.180]  I've just noticed it.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:06.846]  It's some kind of pathological thing they do that when you confront them with really serious stuff that we can turn around and stop, they'll just giggle, they'll laugh at you, and they'll do this little childlike grin and they'll just stick
[00:17:06.886 --> 00:17:08.987]  They're tight, I don't know.
[00:17:09.307 --> 00:17:10.367]  It's funny!
[00:17:10.387 --> 00:17:12.548]  FEMA camps are funny!
[00:17:12.568 --> 00:17:18.471]  And they think if they laugh about it, well I'm delusional, I'm a yuppie, I'm like Karl Rove.
[00:17:18.991 --> 00:17:23.112]  I just make my reality in my brain and everything's alright.
[00:17:23.132 --> 00:17:27.234]  Can you imagine what a founding father would think of that type of scum?
[00:17:28.134 --> 00:17:30.075]  That type of willful trash?
[00:17:30.795 --> 00:17:34.717]  Who want to be dumb, who want to be conned, who want to be gamed.
[00:17:36.039 --> 00:17:37.560]  It's one thing to be conned and not know about it.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.481]  It's another thing to go willfully, oh, I love it!
[00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.643]  And that's the thing, we could have turned this around.
[00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:47.285]  We can still turn this around.
[00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:49.626]  The globalists won't pull the final punches.
[00:17:50.286 --> 00:17:56.149]  They won't pull the rug out from under us completely if they know that we know what they're doing and that we're going to blame them.
[00:17:56.809 --> 00:18:00.591]  Frankly, with Congress with a 14% approval rating, they may not do it now completely.
[00:18:01.303 --> 00:18:03.084]  Frankly, we may have victory.
[00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:04.525]  We can't guarantee that right now.
[00:18:04.945 --> 00:18:06.006]  At least somewhat of a victory.
[00:18:06.046 --> 00:18:07.527]  A soccer landing is a victory.
[00:18:09.148 --> 00:18:11.150]  Not giving them their full will is a victory.
[00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.812]  I mean, in the past, they'd have Congress right now with a 60% bashing Bush.
[00:18:15.432 --> 00:18:16.673]  That's always been the paradigm.
[00:18:17.454 --> 00:18:21.236]  And Bush, you know, would be at a 25% like he is.
[00:18:21.897 --> 00:18:30.022]  And then he would leave office, and they'd put a Democrat in, and we'd blame the Democrat, and we'd put a Republican Congress back in, and they'd keep double-teaming us and playing that
[00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:32.272]  Good cop, bad cop game.
[00:18:33.832 --> 00:18:35.333]  Well, that's not the way it is now.
[00:18:36.473 --> 00:18:38.854]  Now people know, man, you're a bunch of crooks.
[00:18:39.475 --> 00:18:45.617]  You got a 14% approval rating and Dick Cheney has got, what, a 12 in some polls and a 9 in some others.
[00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:48.358]  Hillary's got like an 18.
[00:18:49.999 --> 00:18:50.439]  You see?
[00:18:51.159 --> 00:18:56.121]  You've totally, I mean, the people at least now are finally going, wait, we're being lied to.
[00:18:56.341 --> 00:18:57.382]  They don't have all the details.
[00:18:58.098 --> 00:19:03.279]  But finally, a lot of the slack jog smiley face yuppies I talk to aren't smiling anymore.
[00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:05.019]  They're going, yeah, yeah, I'm worried, yeah.
[00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:06.680]  I know what you're talking about.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.280]  My brother, the cop's beating to death.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:16.961]  Yeah, my neighbor, the CPS took their child because the child fell off a trampoline and broke their foot.
[00:19:17.541 --> 00:19:18.242]  They had witnesses.
[00:19:18.302 --> 00:19:18.902]  It was a party.
[00:19:18.922 --> 00:19:19.642]  They don't care.
[00:19:19.882 --> 00:19:20.962]  They took all their kids.
[00:19:21.122 --> 00:19:22.982]  This stuff's scary.
[00:19:23.302 --> 00:19:24.963]  Listen, I didn't used to believe you.
[00:19:25.103 --> 00:19:26.163]  You better believe it.
[00:19:26.838 --> 00:19:28.839]  It's going on all over the place.
[00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.941]  What do you think this is what we do on air here?
[00:19:31.982 --> 00:19:33.042]  This isn't a game.
[00:19:33.342 --> 00:19:34.343]  It isn't a drill.
[00:19:34.363 --> 00:19:35.624]  It isn't a joke.
[00:19:36.244 --> 00:19:38.026]  We're not playing tiddlywinks here.
[00:19:39.006 --> 00:19:46.371]  There are people running things that if they get their way, they're going to kill most of us.
[00:19:47.772 --> 00:19:49.213]  Do you understand that?
[00:19:49.633 --> 00:19:50.634]  Do you read me?
[00:19:51.326 --> 00:19:55.390]  That's what's at the end of the tunnel if they have their way.
[00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.892]  That's just the bottom of the pit.
[00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:04.543]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:20:05.164 --> 00:20:14.094]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:20:14.535 --> 00:20:21.743]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:14.242]  Welcome back!
[00:25:16.824 --> 00:25:19.586]  Alright, let me go through an analogy.
[00:25:19.807 --> 00:25:20.647]  You know, I love those.
[00:25:21.248 --> 00:25:23.009]  Remember the old Looney Tunes programs?
[00:25:24.611 --> 00:25:25.852]  You'd watch on Saturday morning?
[00:25:26.849 --> 00:25:28.430]  Most people in my age group will remember that.
[00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:32.752]  You know, you're 40, 30, in between those ages.
[00:25:34.453 --> 00:25:40.177]  It had Bugs Bunny, Yosemite Sam, Daffy Duck, Elmer Fudd.
[00:25:41.757 --> 00:25:53.304]  They had one cartoon where it showed the different personalities using basic psychology, and there's actual studies on this, but it's common sense, how they put Yosemite Sam
[00:25:54.790 --> 00:26:00.754]  Or they'd put, in this particular episode, Yosemite Sam and Elmer Fudd in different hats.
[00:26:01.675 --> 00:26:08.779]  One would be a Sherlock Holmes hat, the other would be a policeman hat, the other would be a hunter's hat, or a conductor's hat.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:19.186]  And, you know, they were showing, you know, children's program, how they, I mean, children could understand how when you put on a different hat, you would tend to take on a different persona.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:29.265]  Well, the feds in the late 90's put out federal legislation and they went out and issued black Darth Vader riot gear to all the police across the country in federal training.
[00:26:30.186 --> 00:26:37.770]  And they provocateured one event in Seattle run by the military with hired 50 thugs they brought in, black brigade anarchists.
[00:26:39.531 --> 00:26:44.274]  Please don't email me talking to him about black people, black brigade anarchists, that's the name of them.
[00:26:45.436 --> 00:26:49.920]  The yuppie liberals think the word black connotation in anything must be race.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.082]  That's how they've trained not to listen to what you're talking about.
[00:26:52.102 --> 00:26:55.906]  They're mainly just looking to be politically correct and then shift off all other thinking processes.
[00:26:56.547 --> 00:26:58.809]  There's the Green Brigade, the Red Brigade, and the Black Brigade.
[00:26:58.889 --> 00:26:59.089]  Okay.
[00:27:00.282 --> 00:27:08.508]  Going back to the Black Brigade hired by the government, they came in and did all their burning and attacking and the rest of their behavior, and the police were told to stand down.
[00:27:08.528 --> 00:27:10.709]  Of course, the police weren't part of the conspiracy.
[00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:21.657]  Consciously, they were being used, and then they felt humiliated and follow-ordered, and they'd whine and walk over with the body language of a little dog that had been stomped onto their commanders.
[00:27:22.518 --> 00:27:27.999]  They'd have the Nelly commander out there walking around, you know, in their regular police uniform, out there ordering.
[00:27:28.019 --> 00:27:36.382]  I mean, literally, you see these big guys walk up, like little dogs stooped, begging to be able to fight back when they were getting hit in the head with bottles and cracked over the head.
[00:27:36.422 --> 00:27:41.863]  And the police chief, obviously, in on it, would Nellily, you know, you can't.
[00:27:41.903 --> 00:27:43.524]  And they would, the police would throw fits.
[00:27:43.604 --> 00:27:48.645]  And it was just, you're so pathetic and so manipulatable.
[00:27:49.105 --> 00:27:52.727]  You know, they teach you how to lie to the public, but you know your bosses lie to you all day.
[00:27:52.747 --> 00:27:54.088]  Okay?
[00:27:54.368 --> 00:27:56.149]  What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[00:27:56.949 --> 00:28:02.732]  And then, there were all these 50 plus thousand peaceful demonstrators trying to tackle and trying to stop the anarchists.
[00:28:03.032 --> 00:28:07.594]  The cops would get the orders to go in and stop that, and actually would restrain people from stopping them.
[00:28:07.894 --> 00:28:11.356]  Oh no, I've been told to stop fighting, is what they were told.
[00:28:12.086 --> 00:28:18.609]  But really it was to stop the anarchists from not being able to do their photo op for the international media.
[00:28:18.909 --> 00:28:20.610]  This is all in police state 2, the takeover.
[00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:22.831]  And maybe police like having game run on them.
[00:28:22.871 --> 00:28:24.072]  Okay, fine, then be kind.
[00:28:24.232 --> 00:28:24.832]  Enjoy yourselves.
[00:28:25.352 --> 00:28:26.733]  Don't listen to me, you know, what do I know?
[00:28:27.553 --> 00:28:33.276]  And so Delta Force was running all this out of the hotel, and that came out in the news later.
[00:28:33.866 --> 00:28:55.120]  And then after a day of this, after the news of the image of zit-faced hired hippies running around burning things, neo-hippies, fascist hippies, they're such a thing, that's what they are, running around burning things and knocking out windows and burning trash cans, they pulled back, went into government housing under police protection, one block from the police station.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.621]  People questioned it and said, why is that happening?
[00:28:57.701 --> 00:29:01.504]  And then, boom, the cops were told, attack anyone and everyone.
[00:29:02.134 --> 00:29:05.416]  I mean, they were in neighborhoods pulling women out of cars, stomping on them.
[00:29:05.736 --> 00:29:07.717]  They were macing families and babies.
[00:29:07.757 --> 00:29:13.139]  They were shooting people with rubber bullets ten feet away and, I mean, just blowing chunks of flesh off.
[00:29:13.479 --> 00:29:17.321]  They were running down crowds and yelling, Who's the boss now?
[00:29:17.381 --> 00:29:19.082]  You think it's funny what you did?
[00:29:19.102 --> 00:29:21.883]  And it was the very people trying to stop the anarchist.
[00:29:22.344 --> 00:29:29.507]  All the anarchists sat, bivouacked in complete pleasure in their own government-provided five-story facility.
[00:29:32.216 --> 00:29:38.998]  In all of his black uniforms and rubber bullets and the rest of it, those are training aids to fire real bullets at us in the near future.
[00:29:39.298 --> 00:29:40.579]  We'll come back, I'll tell you more about it.
[00:29:51.462 --> 00:29:52.382]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.842 --> 00:29:54.463]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.363 --> 00:29:58.064]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:04.240]  We would all love to live in a world with clean air and water.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.961]  A world in which our produce is grown naturally.
[00:30:07.261 --> 00:30:10.342]  Without the use of pesticides and other harmful chemicals.
[00:30:10.842 --> 00:30:12.982]  But the truth is, we don't live in such a world.
[00:30:13.142 --> 00:30:14.543]  These toxins enter our bodies.
[00:30:14.803 --> 00:30:18.904]  And the organ in our body that works hard to eliminate these toxins is the liver.
[00:30:19.244 --> 00:30:22.365]  Which is one of the most complex and important organs in the human body.
[00:30:22.645 --> 00:30:23.886]  With more than 500 vital functions.
[00:30:25.126 --> 00:30:33.414]  Give your liver the helping hand it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula in over 76 countries.
[00:30:33.754 --> 00:30:36.457]  And it's backed by over 300 clinical trials and studies.
[00:30:36.817 --> 00:30:44.144]  LIV52 is the most researched herbal formula that helps neutralize toxins from food, water, air, alcohol and prescription medications.

[00:31:02.481 --> 00:31:09.264]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two book set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[00:31:09.624 --> 00:31:16.026]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[00:31:16.507 --> 00:31:26.410]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:30.352]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[00:31:30.652 --> 00:31:33.334]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[00:31:33.974 --> 00:31:36.656]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.

[00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:03.149]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:32:03.169 --> 00:32:05.330]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:08.671]  Allicin, a national antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:32:08.731 --> 00:32:09.411]  is a real thing.
[00:32:09.491 --> 00:32:16.353]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:32:16.493 --> 00:32:21.774]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:32:21.834 --> 00:32:22.694]  We're good to go!
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.702]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:32:52.782 --> 00:32:57.564]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:32:57.685 --> 00:33:00.486]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:33:01.346 --> 00:33:04.348]  Way up, go north to Alaska.
[00:33:04.368 --> 00:33:06.409]  Way up, go north to Alaska.
[00:33:06.449 --> 00:33:10.211]  North to Alaska, go north, the rest is home.
[00:33:10.251 --> 00:33:12.332]  North to Alaska, go north, the rest is home.
[00:33:18.875 --> 00:33:35.208]  Big Sam left Seattle in the year of ninety-two With George Pratt, his partner, and brother Billy, too They crossed the Yukon River and found the bonanza gold
[00:33:35.968 --> 00:33:46.438]  Below that old white mountain, just a little southeast of Nome, Sam crossed the majestic mountains to the valleys far below.
[00:33:47.359 --> 00:33:57.889]  He talked to his team of huskies as he mushed on through the snow, with the northern lights a-runnin' wild in the land of the midnight sun.
[00:34:11.318 --> 00:34:13.099]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:13.119 --> 00:34:18.702]  We're going to go right back to James and Brandon and Rosie and Bruce and Ben and others here in just a moment.
[00:34:20.444 --> 00:34:23.625]  I do hope that you will all patronize us.
[00:34:24.786 --> 00:34:27.368]  I hope that you will support us.
[00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:34.224]  Be patrons of Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:34:34.244 --> 00:34:37.587]  It's always a fine line between patronize and patronizes.
[00:34:37.607 --> 00:34:39.549]  Getting stuck on that, patronizes.
[00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:54.302]  Thank you so much for all the support that you do give us and that support is vital to our continual operation and the things we do here in the Infowar as we wage war on the front lines of this battle.
[00:34:55.698 --> 00:34:59.859]  I have made 15 films and now I guess 15 and a half you could say.
[00:35:00.999 --> 00:35:09.001]  We have the second edition of Terror Storm with 17 minutes of added new footage.
[00:35:09.021 --> 00:35:15.262]  We also remastered all the audio, added more music, more video throughout the different sections of the film total.
[00:35:15.602 --> 00:35:18.483]  So a lot of it, a lot of it is new.
[00:35:21.693 --> 00:35:24.514]  And it is available right now at InfoWars.com.
[00:35:24.554 --> 00:35:27.035]  It will not ship out to the middle of next month.
[00:35:27.075 --> 00:35:32.357]  We have it in stock, but again, because of the national distribution of it, we can't release it until then, until it's nationally released.
[00:35:33.038 --> 00:35:34.798]  But that will be later next month.
[00:35:35.078 --> 00:35:41.701]  But you can pre-order it now, and your order will be shipped out to you via UPS first, once we're able to ship them to you.
[00:35:41.721 --> 00:35:45.723]  So you can pre-order Terror Storm 2nd Edition.
[00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:46.663]  It is the final cut.
[00:35:46.683 --> 00:35:51.085]  There will be no more editions, but it is the 2nd Edition, and it is a special edition.
[00:35:51.593 --> 00:35:53.053]  I'm trying to think of the proper term for it.
[00:35:53.073 --> 00:35:55.414]  I guess really special edition is the final cut.
[00:35:56.374 --> 00:35:58.295]  It's actually one of the History of Government Sponsored Terror.
[00:35:58.815 --> 00:36:10.537]  We did get in from the distributor another 40 or 50 copies that they had left of the old Terror Storm so we can fill some more orders of that but only in combo deals.
[00:36:11.118 --> 00:36:17.439]  It's kind of a problem because you know this is our best seller and it's how we support ourselves but we're waiting to sell the new one.
[00:36:18.075 --> 00:36:23.859]  A lot of people don't particularly want to order it when it's on back order or when we can't ship it to you.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.162]  And so they want the old Terror Storm, which is an excellent addition.
[00:36:28.682 --> 00:36:31.164]  And then we were sold out of that, so we really couldn't offer it.
[00:36:31.184 --> 00:36:36.807]  But now we can offer some of the old Terror Storm, and every copy that goes out will be signed.
[00:36:37.788 --> 00:36:42.411]  Every copy that we send out will have a little signed card with it to make it a collector's item.
[00:36:43.348 --> 00:36:47.431]  And of course, we also carry America, Freedom to Fascism, Loose Change Second Edition.
[00:36:48.011 --> 00:36:52.895]  We also carry Riddles in Stone, 9-11 Mysteries, Demolitions.
[00:36:53.135 --> 00:36:54.416]  All of these are important films.
[00:36:55.036 --> 00:36:56.938]  And these aren't some bootlegs we made out here.
[00:36:56.958 --> 00:37:02.522]  These are the films, the hardcover color case that we ordered from the filmmakers themselves.
[00:37:02.982 --> 00:37:04.643]  So you support the Loose Change crew.
[00:37:04.703 --> 00:37:07.005]  You support Aaron Russo and his family.
[00:37:07.665 --> 00:37:09.567]  You support the folks that made
[00:37:10.094 --> 00:37:23.205]  9-11 Demolitions, you support the people that made Part 1 and 2 of America's Secret Beginnings, and Part 2 is incredible, Riddles in Stone, The Occult Architecture and Layout of Washington, D.C.
[00:37:24.586 --> 00:37:29.930]  It is all available right now at InfoWars.com or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:31.912]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Japan.
[00:37:32.132 --> 00:37:33.133]  Thanks for holding, James.
[00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:40.081]  Thank you very much for taking my call, Mr. Jones.
[00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:43.023]  What are you doing over in Japan?
[00:37:44.283 --> 00:37:48.326]  I am teaching English, actually, but I'm a Canadian citizen.
[00:37:48.486 --> 00:38:00.873]  Actually, I called you tonight about an article that I just finished researching and writing that maybe I hope you can put up on presentplanet.com regarding the new Canadian no-fly list, which was implemented this Monday, June 18th.
[00:38:02.443 --> 00:38:11.913]  I'm sure you know it goes back to the US-Canada Smart Border Declaration that was signed by Foreign Affairs Minister John Manley and Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge back in December 2001.
[00:38:11.953 --> 00:38:17.379]  Sure, and this is part of the whole North American Union Travel Pass.
[00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:19.020]  Of course, exactly.
[00:38:19.281 --> 00:38:25.267]  In fact, if you go to the August 2006 Report to Leaders of the SDP, you'll find one of their initiatives
[00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:29.495]  was on the no-fly list being implemented in all three countries.
[00:38:29.776 --> 00:38:34.539]  And the implementation date on that initiative was, surprise, surprise, June 2007.
[00:38:35.159 --> 00:38:40.623]  And here we are in June 2007, so it seems pretty obvious it's all part of the North American Union.
[00:38:42.244 --> 00:38:48.508]  But I wanted to let your listeners know that there is one bright ray of hope in this, and it's basically the Canadian equivalent of Ron Paul.
[00:38:49.529 --> 00:38:53.111]  Her name is Connie Fogel, and she's with the Canadian Action Party.
[00:38:53.797 --> 00:38:58.520]  And I would commend her to you as perhaps a potential guest on your program in the future.
[00:38:59.821 --> 00:39:03.022]  If your listeners are interested... Well, I believe we've interviewed Connie Vogel.
[00:39:03.743 --> 00:39:04.423]  Oh, okay.
[00:39:04.443 --> 00:39:05.724]  I was not aware of that, actually.
[00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:09.686]  But I am aware of her fine work, and the organization's fine work.
[00:39:09.706 --> 00:39:10.707]  We should get her back on.
[00:39:11.427 --> 00:39:12.508]  Yeah, I would recommend it.
[00:39:12.608 --> 00:39:19.572]  I did an interview with her for my own website, actually, recently, and she had some very enlightening things to say about the no-fly list in Canada.
[00:39:19.652 --> 00:39:20.793]  Oh, good.
[00:39:20.813 --> 00:39:23.094]  Tell us about your website so we can read the news article there.
[00:39:23.832 --> 00:39:28.557]  Okay, actually, my website is www.corbetreports.com.
[00:39:28.657 --> 00:39:31.940]  That's C-O-R-B-E-T-T-reports.com.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.023]  Sure, I've been on that page.
[00:39:34.043 --> 00:39:34.683]  It's a good page.
[00:39:35.324 --> 00:39:36.265]  Yeah, thank you very much.
[00:39:36.325 --> 00:39:39.348]  Well, it's my podcast, so I have done an interview with Ms.
[00:39:39.388 --> 00:39:44.033]  Vogel, and I have a weekly episode, and this week's episode is about the no-fly list in Canada.
[00:39:45.074 --> 00:39:45.294]  Good.
[00:39:45.314 --> 00:39:46.035]  Anything else?
[00:39:46.295 --> 00:39:47.016]  They're from Japan.
[00:39:48.275 --> 00:39:50.956]  Uh, not much happening in Japan, I'm afraid.
[00:39:51.317 --> 00:39:56.980]  I love my Japanese friends dearly, but questioning authority is not exactly a trait the Japanese are known for, I'm afraid.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.282]  So, not a lot of 9-11 truth action happening right now.
[00:40:01.622 --> 00:40:07.045]  Yes, they were put under imperial conditioning a long time ago, but they certainly are great people.
[00:40:07.465 --> 00:40:09.946]  We've got to break their conditioning, and I think that's going to happen.
[00:40:11.067 --> 00:40:11.907]  Thank you for calling.
[00:40:12.347 --> 00:40:15.189]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brandon in Florida.
[00:40:15.269 --> 00:40:16.309]  Brandon, you're on the air.
[00:40:16.329 --> 00:40:17.070]  Hello.
[00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:19.452]  Honored to talk to you.
[00:40:20.652 --> 00:40:27.515]  Did you know that in public schools, they actually handed out envelopes in public schools.
[00:40:27.575 --> 00:40:31.577]  They wanted us to swab our cheek for DNA.
[00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:35.578]  They also wanted to have our fingerprints.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.120]  I'm sure, of course.
[00:40:40.681 --> 00:40:41.421]  Oh yeah?
[00:40:42.201 --> 00:40:42.441]  Yeah.
[00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:44.682]  They actually kept enforcing it a lot, actually.
[00:40:45.183 --> 00:40:46.183]  Well, let me bring this up.
[00:40:47.521 --> 00:40:51.342]  First, five, six, seven years ago, around the country, they would claim it was voluntary.
[00:40:51.963 --> 00:41:00.786]  Now they say, well, if you want to be part of after-school programs, or on the football team, or the band, or park in the parking lot, it's our policy you do this.
[00:41:01.166 --> 00:41:08.108]  It's no law, it's just the New World Order feds that run our local schools have just ordered it.
[00:41:08.148 --> 00:41:10.149]  But let's go to England, where there are a few steps ahead.
[00:41:11.709 --> 00:41:13.210]  Last year, they began announcing
[00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:18.641]  To the elementary students, oh, we're going to play James Bond today!
[00:41:19.501 --> 00:41:37.032]  And they said, come to the cafeteria, and they had retina scanners, face scanners, and swabs for DNA, and the police there, and they said, you're all being enrolled as secret MI6 agents of the Crown, and kids love secret things, and they said, don't tell your parents!
[00:41:37.372 --> 00:41:39.773]  It's part of the James Bond game!
[00:41:40.654 --> 00:41:42.735]  And, now this was all over the papers when it broke,
[00:41:43.727 --> 00:41:49.672]  A lot of the papers defended it and said it was good to deceive the children and deceive the parents, and it was illegal to do.
[00:41:49.692 --> 00:41:51.974]  But again, that was nationwide.
[00:41:51.994 --> 00:42:01.721]  Again, the government illegally, secretly, nationwide, teaching children to be deceptive in light of their parents, and then enrolling them in the National DNA Database.
[00:42:02.181 --> 00:42:07.926]  And Blair leaving office last week said that, just a few days ago actually, maybe it wasn't late, it was Monday,
[00:42:08.582 --> 00:42:09.282]  Well, you know what?
[00:42:09.322 --> 00:42:09.762]  It's a high school.
[00:42:39.031 --> 00:42:58.603]  It's probably more enforced, you know, in the elementary school, you know, because, you know, the kids, obviously, would do something like that, but it wasn't really paid, you know, much paid attention to in our high school, because, you know, we're older and, you know, we don't, but, you know, that's really about it.
[00:42:58.644 --> 00:43:05.508]  I just wanted to bring that to your attention, because, you know, I just want to also talk to you about the European Union thing.
[00:43:06.748 --> 00:43:07.628]  Doesn't exist.
[00:43:07.928 --> 00:43:09.089]  The neocons say so.
[00:43:09.649 --> 00:43:12.450]  Neither does the blue sky every day and the stars in the evening.
[00:43:12.610 --> 00:43:13.450]  You're insane, sir.
[00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:17.251]  And by the way, we're not taking DNA at your school.
[00:43:17.552 --> 00:43:23.674]  Now, if you like it, they'll admit they are and they'll say it's good, but if you start complaining, they'll just say it doesn't exist and send by a man with a machine gun.
[00:43:23.694 --> 00:43:26.414]  Of course, I'm being a little sarcastic here, but that's what it's leading to.
[00:43:26.855 --> 00:43:34.117]  Tell me specifically, did they have this, the teacher go, okay, I've got 25 kits for all of you.
[00:43:34.853 --> 00:43:48.436]  Jim Johnson, Corey Tillman, I'm making up names, John Doe, just come right up here, the school nurse is here to assist, and this is for your safety.
[00:43:49.597 --> 00:43:56.638]  Yeah, you know, they just passed them out, and they said, you know, of course with all this stuff happening, kidnapping, you know, they just passed them out.
[00:43:56.678 --> 00:43:59.959]  Yeah, kidnapping's actually down in the last 20 years now.
[00:44:00.439 --> 00:44:02.159]  It happened about 18 years, a few years has passed.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.120]  Kidnapping hit an all-time high.
[00:44:05.387 --> 00:44:05.927]  No, no, no.
[00:44:05.968 --> 00:44:07.228]  They just passed it out.
[00:44:07.308 --> 00:44:08.689]  You know, I just wanted to...
[00:44:36.043 --> 00:44:39.125]  Now, was there a representative there from the local lodge?
[00:44:39.185 --> 00:44:41.927]  Was it part of the National CHIPS program?
[00:44:42.007 --> 00:44:43.929]  No, I actually haven't heard anything.
[00:44:44.929 --> 00:44:47.772]  I just wanted to bring that to your attention.
[00:44:47.792 --> 00:44:48.512]  Tell me how they did it.
[00:44:48.552 --> 00:44:49.633]  Tell me how they just passed them out.
[00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:51.494]  They actually passed them out once.
[00:44:53.419 --> 00:44:55.480]  And then they passed them out again a few months ago.
[00:44:55.921 --> 00:44:57.622]  Did everyone submit properly?
[00:44:58.022 --> 00:44:58.822]  No, I don't think so.
[00:44:58.842 --> 00:45:00.783]  I think they just kind of shrugged it off, but who knows?
[00:45:00.823 --> 00:45:03.725]  You know, maybe in the younger schools... Well, that's what school's about.
[00:45:03.785 --> 00:45:08.548]  DNA kits, and men with black uniforms, and barbed wire fences, and men being frisked.
[00:45:08.568 --> 00:45:09.228]  You know, that's freedom.
[00:45:09.629 --> 00:45:11.970]  Okay, well, you had a question about the European Union.
[00:45:12.739 --> 00:45:15.400]  Yeah, I mean, that does exist, of course, right?
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.781]  No, it doesn't exist, sir.
[00:45:17.821 --> 00:45:19.161]  There's no move towards global government.
[00:45:19.181 --> 00:45:20.601]  There's no such thing as a new world order.
[00:45:20.982 --> 00:45:22.442]  President Bush never talked about it.
[00:45:22.462 --> 00:45:23.362]  That's an urban legend.
[00:45:23.702 --> 00:45:25.523]  China doesn't kill dissidents for organs.
[00:45:26.423 --> 00:45:28.224]  The Bill of Rights doesn't exist.
[00:45:28.984 --> 00:45:31.285]  The Bill of Rights is evil and doesn't exist.
[00:45:31.305 --> 00:45:39.607]  No, I mean, obviously, sir, the EU exists, just like the North American Union exists, but they just keep denying it exists so the public doesn't even know that it's a military tactic.
[00:45:39.947 --> 00:45:41.048]  They'll say there's no amnesty.
[00:45:41.088 --> 00:45:41.848]  It's total amnesty.
[00:45:42.907 --> 00:45:46.048]  They'll say, we're coming home from the war in six months, it's four plus years later.
[00:45:46.329 --> 00:45:47.889]  It's just all lies, totally criminal.
[00:45:48.509 --> 00:45:49.130]  Sure, sure.
[00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:56.473]  I'm just wondering, like, you know, they got the Euro, I'm just, you know, I'm surprised that England is still on the pound.
[00:45:56.493 --> 00:45:57.753]  Is that correct?
[00:45:59.134 --> 00:46:00.034]  They're still on the pound?
[00:46:00.154 --> 00:46:00.375]  Yes.
[00:46:01.035 --> 00:46:10.639]  Yeah, see, that's what's kind of surprising me, because, you know, you have all the Euro, they're trying to unite Europe, which I think they already have, of course, because they've got the same currency, but I'm just
[00:46:11.649 --> 00:46:27.935]  That's because England, compared to the continent, hasn't had Hitler and Napoleon and other people running things, and William of Orange, and they've got a bigger history of freedom.
[00:46:30.925 --> 00:46:35.127]  They don't have electronic voting machines in yet, though they're moving now to replace all those.
[00:46:35.687 --> 00:46:40.710]  Then it won't matter if the polls show 85% or 89% are against the Euro.
[00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:46.452]  The polls will still show that, but magically on Vote Day, everyone will vote for the Euro.
[00:46:47.853 --> 00:46:50.855]  Sure, I mean, they keep voting it down too, right?
[00:46:50.875 --> 00:46:53.656]  But as soon as the special new machines are in,
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:01.282]  As soon as those are in, they'll come to their senses and magically vote.
[00:47:01.302 --> 00:47:02.922]  They'll all be microchipped, probably.
[00:47:03.422 --> 00:47:04.542]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[00:47:04.562 --> 00:47:06.223]  I mean, that's how late in the game this is.
[00:47:07.263 --> 00:47:09.583]  Let's talk to Rosie in Connecticut.
[00:47:09.603 --> 00:47:09.963]  Welcome.
[00:47:10.884 --> 00:47:11.544]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:11.804 --> 00:47:12.184]  Hi.
[00:47:12.604 --> 00:47:13.184]  Hi.
[00:47:13.444 --> 00:47:14.805]  Calling from the Constitution State.
[00:47:14.825 --> 00:47:15.225]  Absolutely.
[00:47:15.365 --> 00:47:16.085]  What's on your mind?
[00:47:18.944 --> 00:47:27.572]  Yeah, I've been observing something for the last 20 years with one friend 20 years ago in Stanford, Connecticut, and now I have another friend in Rutland, Vermont.
[00:47:28.733 --> 00:47:39.663]  I would call them artist patriots, because they're people who really love their country, love this country, but in the name of the arts, they're trying to help their artist friends.
[00:47:39.743 --> 00:47:41.765]  Well, the FBI would call that al-Qaeda.
[00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:42.770]  I think.
[00:47:44.410 --> 00:48:08.756]  Well, I just am concerned about the safety of my friend, because what has happened is he's discovered, just like another friend did 20 years ago, he's gone through it all over again, I'm watching it all over again, he's trying to help this community, the town calls together these creative economy meetings, which are just wasting the time and hopes and dreams of the artists, and they have no intention of
[00:48:09.315 --> 00:48:12.196]  Really doing anything with the artists, except using them.
[00:48:12.216 --> 00:48:26.522]  I would like to know, I guess, is there anyone that you know of that is maybe doing a documentary specifically about patriotism and the arts movement and how they're being taken advantage of?
[00:48:26.542 --> 00:48:31.964]  Yeah, the city, under federal funds, all over the nation, will, until there's an art fair,
[00:48:32.751 --> 00:48:41.676]  And then they might give him some paltry sums, and it's basically to put out pro-New World Order propaganda, or whatever the propaganda of the city is, whatever it's putting out.
[00:48:41.756 --> 00:48:42.556]  Lamb grabs.
[00:48:43.037 --> 00:48:43.577]  Exactly.
[00:48:43.737 --> 00:48:45.298]  That's exactly what happens everywhere.
[00:48:45.358 --> 00:48:46.138]  Child-grabbing.
[00:48:46.158 --> 00:48:48.780]  Yeah, well, let's just look at the Soviet Union or Russia.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:54.723]  The artists are then basically brought in to, you know, soon they'll be building statues of George Bush to bow down to, probably.
[00:48:57.026 --> 00:49:00.670]  That would be good to show how the government's co-opted the arts.
[00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:04.814]  I mean, they've always tried to do that.
[00:49:05.895 --> 00:49:10.639]  Not only is it good to show it, but it's actually, I think, would grab people's attention in a different way.
[00:49:10.679 --> 00:49:12.781]  Because here you see these long-haired patriots.
[00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:13.322]  They're artists.
[00:49:13.482 --> 00:49:15.724]  And it's the oxymoron, you know, artist patriot.
[00:49:15.744 --> 00:49:19.508]  But I think that's a really good vehicle for
[00:49:23.608 --> 00:49:31.911]  Well, that's what's happening is that the artists out there, regardless of what color they are or how long their hair is, whether they have dreadlocks or are bald-headed, I don't care.
[00:49:32.431 --> 00:49:39.734]  They are out there putting out art on the internet and spray-painting on the wall and putting out books.
[00:49:39.754 --> 00:49:40.535]  It's beautiful.
[00:49:40.575 --> 00:49:41.995]  That's why we're having such an effect.
[00:49:44.196 --> 00:49:48.378]  I'm just talking about grants money, talking about money.
[00:49:49.005 --> 00:49:54.987]  They're finding out that money is being put into real estate projects like grant money.
[00:49:55.047 --> 00:49:55.787]  That's one thing.
[00:49:56.007 --> 00:49:59.568]  Oh yeah, well I mean everybody knows the government is looting all the arts funds.
[00:49:59.768 --> 00:50:00.328]  Exactly.
[00:50:00.368 --> 00:50:08.810]  That's one way, but also, you know, they can't figure out why nothing ever moves forward, why they're even meeting with, you know, the state.
[00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.171]  Well that's called Delphi.
[00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:11.251]  Delphi technique.
[00:50:12.508 --> 00:50:20.454]  They'll have meetings that are pointless just to hear what you have to say, to make you expend your energy to feel like they're listening to you or you have an effect.
[00:50:20.794 --> 00:50:23.435]  And they'll agree with you and say, that's great, let me pass that on.
[00:50:23.455 --> 00:50:28.339]  And then you're back there a year later and nothing's changed and they say, that's great, I'll move that on.
[00:50:28.359 --> 00:50:30.220]  And they actually have handbooks.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:34.563]  These are public handbooks in public relations and city management.
[00:50:36.138 --> 00:50:37.319]  Is how to pacify you.
[00:50:37.959 --> 00:50:42.282]  But then the general public thinks that no one tries to pacify and there's no propaganda.
[00:50:42.883 --> 00:50:44.104]  They're taught out of handbooks.
[00:50:45.264 --> 00:50:54.991]  So you ought to get one of those handbooks, and print a lot of the manuals up offline, and take that and say, hey, you're using techniques out of a brainwashing manual, and then they go, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[00:50:55.492 --> 00:50:56.933]  I mean, they're scum, folks.
[00:50:56.953 --> 00:50:57.473]  They're everywhere.
[00:50:57.493 --> 00:50:58.073]  They're all around us.
[00:50:58.093 --> 00:50:58.594]  They're the enemy.
[00:51:04.714 --> 00:51:07.897]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.237 --> 00:51:10.139]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.539 --> 00:51:18.166]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:25.923]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.323 --> 00:51:37.728]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.048 --> 00:51:41.590]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.971]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.271 --> 00:51:48.053]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:54:34.441 --> 00:54:37.805]  It's so easy to give in sometimes.
[00:54:49.568 --> 00:54:50.189]  Welcome back.
[00:54:50.229 --> 00:54:52.070]  We're going to be going to more of your calls.
[00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:55.052]  We do have Raymond Schwab joining us.
[00:54:59.876 --> 00:55:05.341]  Raymond Schwab had his son taken by CPS.
[00:55:05.381 --> 00:55:10.345]  The police called CPS on him and they called back to one of the towns.
[00:55:10.385 --> 00:55:11.866]  They somehow learned where they were going to be.
[00:55:11.926 --> 00:55:13.107]  They took his son away.
[00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:18.112]  For being part of 9-11 Truth, telling them that's illegal, that's not allowed.
[00:55:18.552 --> 00:55:19.892]  This is all on video, by the way.
[00:55:21.192 --> 00:55:25.894]  And then they gave the child to a grandmother, his wife's mother.
[00:55:25.914 --> 00:55:30.955]  And then CPS was trying to take the 7-year-old boy away from her.
[00:55:31.615 --> 00:55:36.156]  And then he came on the show, and we talked about the people that did it, and they called him and told him.
[00:55:36.176 --> 00:55:37.456]  They said, that's it.
[00:55:37.936 --> 00:55:38.516]  You're punished.
[00:55:38.956 --> 00:55:40.117]  She said, they punish you.
[00:55:40.137 --> 00:55:41.177]  Of course, that's totally illegal.
[00:55:42.941 --> 00:55:47.482]  But they're so used to doing things that are unlawful that they think it's normal.
[00:55:47.963 --> 00:55:50.824]  Well, you should have kept your mouth shut.
[00:55:51.564 --> 00:55:53.404]  We're fully taking the child now.
[00:55:53.984 --> 00:55:55.565]  That ought to teach you, boy.
[00:55:57.266 --> 00:56:00.987]  I mean, that is literally what we're talking about here.
[00:56:01.287 --> 00:56:04.088]  There ain't nobody beats this town in Kansas.
[00:56:06.648 --> 00:56:08.709]  We run things around here, boy.
[00:56:12.231 --> 00:56:16.613]  And that is literally the type of evil we see in this nation today.
[00:56:17.814 --> 00:56:19.054]  We also have the police on tape.
[00:56:19.074 --> 00:56:19.815]  We're going to be playing it.
[00:56:20.735 --> 00:56:24.997]  Now they walk up to them on a street corner and say they can't preach in America.
[00:56:27.118 --> 00:56:28.379]  And there's nobody even around them.
[00:56:28.399 --> 00:56:30.020]  They're just standing there on the side of the road.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:31.381]  Rural area.
[00:56:32.121 --> 00:56:32.801]  Edge of a little town.
[00:56:34.082 --> 00:56:37.203]  And they just walk and they say, you're not allowed to be out here preaching.
[00:56:37.223 --> 00:56:38.424]  And they said, I've got a First Amendment.
[00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.354]  How about I charge you with a felony for wiretapping, boy?
[00:56:45.095 --> 00:56:48.117]  How about I ruin your life with some false charges?
[00:56:48.298 --> 00:56:52.081]  Because I sleep real good at night when I do that.
[00:56:55.303 --> 00:56:57.245]  I mean, that's literally the spirit of these people.
[00:56:57.845 --> 00:57:00.327]  So we'll be playing that for you, coming up in the next hour.
[00:57:00.928 --> 00:57:03.310]  We'll take some calls in the next segment and get Mr. Schwab on.
[00:57:04.477 --> 00:57:05.297]  We all need to pray for.
[00:57:05.317 --> 00:57:08.498]  I do want to tell you about our research herbs and one of their great products, LIV52.
[00:57:08.618 --> 00:57:12.420]  It is the world's best-selling liver support formula, period.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:21.823]  LIV52 neutralizes all kinds of toxins and poisons from the food you eat, the water you drink, the air you breathe, and prescription medications, which are all sources of detrimental effects on the liver.
[00:57:22.263 --> 00:57:24.324]  It improves the functional efficiency of the liver.
[00:57:24.764 --> 00:57:32.627]  LIV52 is a unique all-natural complex of multi-ingredient formula, safe and effective whether you've been diagnosed
[00:57:33.605 --> 00:57:33.945]  I think so.
[00:57:53.783 --> 00:57:56.565]  Live52 ensures optimal liver function.
[00:57:56.945 --> 00:57:59.106]  Endorsed by over 200,000 healthcare professionals.
[00:57:59.566 --> 00:58:01.688]  Over 300 clinical trials and research studies.
[00:58:02.108 --> 00:58:05.770]  Approximately 2 billion tablets and 13 million syrup bottles.
[00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:08.271]  Live52 are sold every year worldwide.
[00:58:08.832 --> 00:58:10.253]  Live52ResearchServes.com or 1-800-845-3841.
[00:58:10.333 --> 00:58:12.474]  We will start the second hour in 70 seconds after this break.
[00:58:24.225 --> 00:58:27.366]  And, uh, we will take a few more calls and we'll get Raymond Schwab on.
[00:58:28.226 --> 00:58:32.287]  Soviet Union, they would take your children's punishment for your political activities.
[00:58:32.967 --> 00:58:33.887]  That was under Lenin.
[00:58:33.927 --> 00:58:37.508]  By Stalin's time, they just dropped by and blew your head off and raped your wife.
[00:58:37.868 --> 00:58:38.648]  That's coming soon.
[00:58:38.668 --> 00:58:39.688]  You know that, all of you do.
[00:58:41.649 --> 00:58:45.889]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.452 --> 00:58:58.113]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.773 --> 00:58:59.834]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.534 --> 00:59:01.675]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.316 --> 00:59:03.116]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.877 --> 00:59:04.758]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.778 --> 00:59:09.101]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.622 --> 00:59:13.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.086 --> 00:59:24.593]  In the United States, in many areas, if you protest against the war, or you hold up a 9-11 truth sign, you gotta know, that's why we gotta protest.
[00:59:24.753 --> 00:59:25.494]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:59:27.129 --> 00:59:29.470]  They will send CPS to take your children.
[00:59:31.832 --> 00:59:34.973]  Total proof of absolute darkness setting upon the country.
[00:59:35.413 --> 00:59:36.814]  That's coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:37.234 --> 00:59:38.795]  Let's talk to Bruce in Colorado.
[00:59:38.815 --> 00:59:39.676]  Bruce, you're on the air.
[00:59:39.716 --> 00:59:40.356]  Thanks for holding.
[00:59:41.136 --> 00:59:42.357]  Hello, Alex.
[00:59:42.577 --> 00:59:51.522]  I want to tell people about a county resolution that they can use in their own county, which I have on my website.
[00:59:52.482 --> 00:59:55.744]  It's being reworded in Virginia and in Florida.
[00:59:57.328 --> 01:00:00.669]  Um, it's got to do with the Patriot Act, but not just that.
[01:00:00.729 --> 01:00:10.573]  It's got to do with CPS abuses, Military Commissions Act, and a whole host of other things in a reference to Jack McClann, his video, and his organization.
[01:00:11.234 --> 01:00:12.114]  What is this again?
[01:00:12.994 --> 01:00:18.316]  Uh, it's about a resolution that people can use around the country for their county.
[01:00:18.717 --> 01:00:19.797]  A county resolution.
[01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:21.572]  Oh, that's great.
[01:00:21.612 --> 01:00:27.196]  Kind of like the UN Free Zone Resolutions or the Anti-Unpatriot Act Act, yeah.
[01:00:27.656 --> 01:00:28.457]  Yes, exactly.
[01:00:28.497 --> 01:00:38.864]  But not just the Patriot Act, it's also a lot of other issues that I just... Basically a redeclaration of independence for your community, and that's excellent.
[01:00:38.884 --> 01:00:39.745]  Where do we find one?
[01:00:42.887 --> 01:00:44.028]  Hey, Bruce, you there, bro?
[01:00:45.489 --> 01:00:46.430]  He just dropped, okay.
[01:00:48.104 --> 01:00:49.465]  Let's go to Derek in Texas.
[01:00:49.485 --> 01:00:50.286]  Derek, you're on the air.
[01:00:50.326 --> 01:00:50.686]  Go ahead.
[01:00:50.706 --> 01:00:54.090]  Hey Alex, thanks a lot for all your great work you've done.
[01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.191]  No, thanks for calling.
[01:00:55.211 --> 01:00:55.751]  Go ahead.
[01:00:56.532 --> 01:01:02.959]  Yes, Destroyed by Design woke me up and I've woken a lot of other people up by dropping your name to people in the media.
[01:01:03.219 --> 01:01:05.241]  When did you see America Destroyed by Design?
[01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:13.463]  I was in Austin working about a year ago, and I was asking a guy in the gym, I was like, who in the media actually knows the truth about 9-11?
[01:01:13.843 --> 01:01:17.624]  And this guy's eyes got really big, and he goes, you gotta hear this guy Alex Jones.
[01:01:18.764 --> 01:01:30.688]  So I went over to his place, and we watched America Destroyed by Design together, and although I knew some of the things about the United Nations being communist, I just had a pile of bricks, and you were like the mortar that built the wall.
[01:01:31.988 --> 01:01:33.128]  Well, I'm flattered.
[01:01:33.168 --> 01:01:34.129]  That's my first film.
[01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:35.289]  I'm a lot skinnier there.
[01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:37.731]  About 175 pounds.
[01:01:39.072 --> 01:01:43.415]  I made that film 11 years ago, released it 10 years ago, and it's still a good video.
[01:01:44.676 --> 01:02:02.207]  Yeah, and the foundation to really what's going on with the Morgan-Carnegie-Rockefeller triangle that pretty much established world government 100 years ago with their different trade acts and financing, World War I, World War II, and so forth.
[01:02:03.288 --> 01:02:03.568]  I agree.
[01:02:04.398 --> 01:02:09.479]  But basically, I want to plug a Ron Paul event tomorrow morning in Palestine, Texas, if I may.
[01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:10.159]  Sure!
[01:02:10.819 --> 01:02:14.580]  That's out in East Texas, right outside of, is that Freestone County?
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:16.520]  I'm not sure.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:27.882]  I live in Falls County, the middle of Texas, but I'm on meetup.com, and a guy emailed me, asked me to come, and I'm going to sponsor some events later on this year in Falls County.
[01:02:28.342 --> 01:02:32.783]  But to those that live in Central Texas... Is Ron Paul going to be at this?
[01:02:33.593 --> 01:02:34.053]  No, no, no.
[01:02:34.113 --> 01:02:35.434]  Ron Paul's not going to be at this.
[01:02:35.474 --> 01:02:41.098]  This is actually to celebrate a local community football player who's in the NFL.
[01:02:41.678 --> 01:02:43.279]  But there's going to be a lot of Ron Paul.
[01:02:43.699 --> 01:02:47.121]  At least the guy that emailed me indicated there's going to be a lot of Ron Paul.
[01:02:47.141 --> 01:02:47.722]  Okay, alright.
[01:02:47.782 --> 01:02:49.623]  Well listen, I really appreciate it.
[01:02:49.683 --> 01:02:50.203]  Anything else?
[01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.865]  Call Linda with the Sean Hannity.
[01:02:53.945 --> 01:02:56.447]  All your callers, call Linda with the Sean Hannity Show.
[01:02:56.914 --> 01:02:59.275]  Tell her that you want to talk about Fred Thompson.
[01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:09.199]  It is a lie, it's deceitful, but that will get you in, and then when you go in and talk about Fred Thompson, turn it around, drop Ron Paul, and have some fun with that.
[01:03:09.879 --> 01:03:11.640]  Yeah, they're certainly getting upset over there.
[01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:15.562]  We took over that show a few weeks back, and good job all the listeners for doing that.
[01:03:16.182 --> 01:03:19.143]  Yeah, Fred Thompson is attacking anybody on 9-11 Truth.
[01:03:19.804 --> 01:03:22.985]  Fred Thompson is anti-gun, he is pro-war.
[01:03:24.005 --> 01:03:25.066]  He's pro-amnesty.
[01:03:25.506 --> 01:03:26.587]  He's a fake conservative.
[01:03:26.607 --> 01:03:27.528]  He's an actor, folks.
[01:03:28.709 --> 01:03:30.631]  And they're putting him in there.
[01:03:30.651 --> 01:03:31.611]  He's now the frontrunner.
[01:03:32.933 --> 01:03:33.573]  And he's a ringer.
[01:03:34.073 --> 01:03:36.856]  The guy's pretty much dying of cancer.
[01:03:36.876 --> 01:03:37.937]  He's got really bad cancer.
[01:03:39.258 --> 01:03:41.580]  He's meant to go in there and drop the ball so Hillary can get it.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.902]  Sean Hannity's show talks about how they're trying to stop Hillary.
[01:03:45.423 --> 01:03:47.304]  Fox News is behind Hillary.
[01:03:47.845 --> 01:03:49.046]  She's a total operative.
[01:03:54.987 --> 01:04:06.256]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:04:06.457 --> 01:04:14.343]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:04:14.343 --> 01:04:15.083]  We're good to go!
[01:04:37.793 --> 01:04:40.337]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[01:04:40.397 --> 01:04:41.038]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:41.398]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:43.962]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:04:56.090 --> 01:05:01.574]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:01.934 --> 01:05:09.579]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.262 --> 01:05:17.325]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:29.130]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:32.972]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.412 --> 01:05:35.373]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.673 --> 01:05:39.515]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:55.651 --> 01:05:57.292]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[01:05:57.493 --> 01:06:01.617]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[01:06:02.228 --> 01:06:07.112]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:14.058]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more!
[01:06:14.793 --> 01:06:17.495]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[01:06:17.655 --> 01:06:27.622]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[01:06:27.902 --> 01:06:31.605]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[01:06:31.665 --> 01:06:38.149]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[01:06:38.329 --> 01:06:39.370]  Are you ready to go solar?

[01:06:52.959 --> 01:06:58.043]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.363 --> 01:07:00.645]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:11.582 --> 01:07:27.812]  If you go up to InfoWars.com, we are posting, and as we speak, I said posted hours ago, I don't know why it hasn't been posted.
[01:07:33.712 --> 01:07:36.173]  But we're going to be posting videos so it's easy to find.
[01:07:36.613 --> 01:07:47.217]  There are now dozens and dozens, I don't know, 30, 40, I don't know how many of these videos up and on the web, but they've sent us a lot of different videos that we're going to be using in a 9-11 Truth video.
[01:07:47.237 --> 01:07:55.861]  I'm going to make a film next year about the 9-11 Truth movement, about the different people involved in it.
[01:07:55.921 --> 01:07:58.662]  I'm going to be telling the story of Elliot Nash.
[01:08:00.703 --> 01:08:11.907]  Of course, the gentleman whose son has now been taken away from him for being involved in 9-11 Truth, and that's Raymond Schwab, Elliot Nash of Bates Shalom Ministries.
[01:08:11.927 --> 01:08:17.649]  They're just lay pastors marching across the country, and every few days their family drives out to meet him.
[01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:21.391]  It was during the summer, in their RV, a seven-year-old son.
[01:08:21.411 --> 01:08:24.932]  It's his wife's genetic son.
[01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:26.953]  It's his stepson.
[01:08:27.805 --> 01:08:28.745]  Very sweet little boy.
[01:08:29.226 --> 01:08:35.628]  What a great education to be during the summer instead of sitting around watching video games and eating Kraft macaroni and cheese with MSG in it.
[01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:40.610]  To be driving across the country and experiencing this and seeing this.
[01:08:41.231 --> 01:08:44.892]  All that CPS showed up and said you shouldn't have a child out here.
[01:08:44.932 --> 01:08:46.173]  You're not allowed to protest.
[01:08:46.193 --> 01:08:49.194]  You're not allowed to... They have cops everywhere saying turn your cameras off.
[01:08:49.234 --> 01:08:50.034]  I'm going to arrest you.
[01:08:50.054 --> 01:08:51.515]  You're not allowed to protest.
[01:08:51.635 --> 01:08:52.395]  Over and over again.
[01:08:53.476 --> 01:08:56.237]  You guys make sure and be sure and send me everything new you've got.
[01:08:57.054 --> 01:08:58.815]  Because it's definitely going to go in the documentary.
[01:08:59.675 --> 01:09:05.557]  And this story will be told, and the people involved in these crimes will be brought to justice, whether it's in this world or by God.
[01:09:06.937 --> 01:09:09.838]  And it's just so amazing what they're doing.
[01:09:09.878 --> 01:09:12.299]  But I know your wife's really freaked out.
[01:09:12.659 --> 01:09:18.701]  Just to recap, we talked about off-air, and Raymond's fine with talking about this, and we'll talk about the free speech issues.
[01:09:20.902 --> 01:09:24.783]  He was on with us a few weeks ago when they had come to the wedding,
[01:09:26.218 --> 01:09:28.682]  In Kansas, they had grabbed a seven-year-old.
[01:09:28.702 --> 01:09:31.847]  The mother was crying, but she let him take the child.
[01:09:31.947 --> 01:09:32.989]  I don't know if I can handle that.
[01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:34.571]  He was crying.
[01:09:35.112 --> 01:09:39.920]  A bunch of armed police, they took the child and then the child in court went to the grandmother.
[01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:49.349]  And the CPS was there interrogating the grandmother saying, trying to say she wasn't good and I said you watch next, they'll take the child from the grandmother because they don't want you in the family.
[01:09:49.549 --> 01:09:52.272]  They have to act like they allow that to be checked into.
[01:09:52.312 --> 01:10:01.820]  You can have family that are Nobel Prize winning doctors and if the CPS takes your child and say your father and mother who are both Nobel Prize winners want the child, you usually can't get them.
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:14.364]  I mean, they don't want family getting a child, and they want to send them to the system, and then when they cry, they say they're depressed, they put them on drugs, then they get hundreds of thousands in government funds instead of tens of thousands a year.
[01:10:15.864 --> 01:10:22.467]  Then if they can put you on enough drugs, you start having seizures or have medical problems, they can then commit you, and then the massive cash begins to flow.
[01:10:22.807 --> 01:10:25.247]  I mean, it's hardcore evil, folks.
[01:10:27.759 --> 01:10:31.102]  They called, when we gave their number out, sparingly.
[01:10:31.122 --> 01:10:32.984]  We just mentioned where they were at and who they were.
[01:10:33.004 --> 01:10:34.485]  Didn't even really say call.
[01:10:34.505 --> 01:10:35.586]  We just said, well, that's the number.
[01:10:35.626 --> 01:10:36.747]  We didn't push it, to my point.
[01:10:37.568 --> 01:10:38.529]  They got some phone calls.
[01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:45.135]  And they called very peaceful, Raymond Schwab up and said, oh, you've done it now.
[01:10:45.395 --> 01:10:46.636]  You've given our number out.
[01:10:47.857 --> 01:10:48.418]  That's it.
[01:10:48.458 --> 01:10:50.039]  This is going to make it bad on your case.
[01:10:50.199 --> 01:10:52.301]  We're just going to punish you through your son now.
[01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.578]  And he said, well, what do you expect me to do?
[01:10:56.258 --> 01:11:01.001]  And now they've taken the son completely into foster care, into the camp.
[01:11:01.021 --> 01:11:06.743]  This is public child kidnapping, folks, and it's institutionalized.
[01:11:07.304 --> 01:11:10.145]  And they've said to him, you know, you do what you got to do.
[01:11:10.185 --> 01:11:12.366]  You go back on air, but that just makes it tough on your son.
[01:11:12.946 --> 01:11:20.110]  So just openly punishing a seven-year-old and literally holding a seven-year-old captive and for ransom.
[01:11:20.846 --> 01:11:22.988]  Uh, to submit, but then Raymond said, what do I do?
[01:11:23.008 --> 01:11:24.068]  You're taking him anyways.
[01:11:24.088 --> 01:11:26.230]  And they're just like, you're dangerous.
[01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:28.611]  The people you've got calling are dangerous.
[01:11:28.972 --> 01:11:30.313]  You just keep your mouth shut.
[01:11:30.353 --> 01:11:32.294]  Basically, let them do what they're doing.
[01:11:34.335 --> 01:11:37.458]  It's just, it's, it's so obvious who the bad guys are.
[01:11:38.738 --> 01:11:42.701]  And when you watch these cops on the video, on Google Video, there's hours of it.
[01:11:43.121 --> 01:11:46.724]  Every mile or two, they pull up and go, what's that sign?
[01:11:48.045 --> 01:11:49.786]  Well, it's a sign saying that we're against the war.
[01:11:50.675 --> 01:11:51.776]  In other words, I'm Christian.
[01:11:52.357 --> 01:11:53.258]  That's your opinion.
[01:11:53.618 --> 01:11:55.280]  Listen, people don't like seeing it.
[01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:56.781]  Put that sign away.
[01:11:56.841 --> 01:11:57.863]  Give me your licenses.
[01:11:57.883 --> 01:11:59.024]  Let me check everything.
[01:11:59.404 --> 01:12:00.105]  We've aired this here.
[01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:03.711]  Another guy runs out with a gun in his belt.
[01:12:03.771 --> 01:12:04.791]  No badge, nothing.
[01:12:05.211 --> 01:12:06.372]  Get me back up out of here!
[01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:07.212]  Oh my God!
[01:12:07.232 --> 01:12:08.992]  Oh my God!
[01:12:09.252 --> 01:12:11.713]  Don't get that camera off of me!
[01:12:11.733 --> 01:12:11.773]  Oh!
[01:12:12.493 --> 01:12:13.554]  You know, just freaking out.
[01:12:13.694 --> 01:12:15.514]  I'm telling you right now!
[01:12:15.594 --> 01:12:18.655]  I'm gonna... Starts menacing him as they put the camera down, but you hear him on tape.
[01:12:18.775 --> 01:12:19.435]  That's better!
[01:12:19.755 --> 01:12:20.475]  Oh, that's better!
[01:12:20.635 --> 01:12:21.196]  Good!
[01:12:21.576 --> 01:12:22.136]  Good!
[01:12:22.156 --> 01:12:23.876]  I mean, they're almost that bad, folks.
[01:12:24.156 --> 01:12:24.997]  This is America.
[01:12:25.377 --> 01:12:26.097]  Oh, yeah!
[01:12:26.257 --> 01:12:27.217]  Oh, yeah!
[01:12:27.978 --> 01:12:29.538]  And so they're walking from Colorado.
[01:12:30.592 --> 01:12:45.692]  Across the country to D.C., they're in Illinois, and this is the latest video of that, but Raymond Schwab, I know you're here to talk about the First Amendment, your wife doesn't right now want, she's saying, you know, let's give it a week, see what these people do, pray God they do the right thing and at least give the child back to the grandmother.
[01:12:50.552 --> 01:12:55.194]  You know, they're telling you to get off their back, but they've taken your son, and they're just shocked!
[01:12:55.575 --> 01:12:56.715]  Why are you upset?
[01:12:56.735 --> 01:12:58.476]  This is completely normal!
[01:12:59.197 --> 01:13:10.963]  But just first, describe what's happened now with the political retribution by the Commissariat, the son being taken, your son being taken, because you didn't properly submit and lick boots.
[01:13:11.563 --> 01:13:11.843]  Sure.
[01:13:12.383 --> 01:13:13.484]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[01:13:13.964 --> 01:13:15.305]  I do have to be a little careful.
[01:13:15.345 --> 01:13:16.846]  We ended up taking everything off the website as well.
[01:13:18.335 --> 01:13:19.796]  Just for the time being.
[01:13:19.937 --> 01:13:23.419]  Basically, when I came back... They told you to take everything off the website!
[01:13:23.439 --> 01:13:24.320]  This is America!
[01:13:24.340 --> 01:13:25.961]  We got your son!
[01:13:26.161 --> 01:13:27.642]  Take it off!
[01:13:27.963 --> 01:13:29.664]  Get rid of your first amendment!
[01:13:29.724 --> 01:13:30.765]  We got him!
[01:13:30.985 --> 01:13:32.446]  I'm sorry, it's just so evil!
[01:13:32.806 --> 01:13:41.173]  But I do want to specify... Some people have been calling one person named Suzanne, and she wasn't one that had been doing part of this.
[01:13:41.313 --> 01:13:44.475]  She had been following a court order, and she's terrified.
[01:13:45.256 --> 01:13:47.718]  Some people have been barraging just her alone.
[01:13:48.106 --> 01:13:50.587]  When it's really not her that has the power to do anything.
[01:13:51.107 --> 01:13:53.508]  But when I did come back, I had all these people call me.
[01:13:54.029 --> 01:14:00.231]  And, you know, even our attorney pretty much told me, you know, we don't care about what you guys are doing.
[01:14:00.591 --> 01:14:01.552]  It's not important.
[01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:02.592]  Come back here.
[01:14:03.452 --> 01:14:04.653]  Stay in a homeless shelter.
[01:14:04.693 --> 01:14:05.813]  We don't care if you have a place.
[01:14:05.853 --> 01:14:07.654]  This is my defense attorney, okay?
[01:14:07.834 --> 01:14:08.995]  You shouldn't have went on the radio.
[01:14:09.035 --> 01:14:10.255]  You shouldn't have talked to anybody.
[01:14:10.295 --> 01:14:10.936]  Now let's be clear.
[01:14:10.976 --> 01:14:12.556]  You guys live in Colorado.
[01:14:12.716 --> 01:14:16.618]  They have a child snatching in Kansas, and they're saying you've got to come there.
[01:14:16.988 --> 01:14:22.150]  Yeah, I gotta come there, and even though we don't have any support anywhere to live, they said, we'll go to a crisis center.
[01:14:22.490 --> 01:14:24.651]  And I was like, and that's gonna prove what?
[01:14:24.771 --> 01:14:27.613]  That we're, you know... I know, now listen, listen, listen, listen.
[01:14:27.813 --> 01:14:31.875]  And of course, you're lawyers from the local area and plays golf with these people, right?
[01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:33.195]  Absolutely.
[01:14:33.295 --> 01:14:35.216]  What's his name, Billy Jean or something?
[01:14:35.416 --> 01:14:41.559]  Well, let me tell you, you go here so we can say that you're bankrupt and so that we can say you're destitute and...
[01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:45.039]  You'll never see the child again!
[01:14:45.119 --> 01:14:45.579]  Ha ha!
[01:14:45.839 --> 01:14:47.860]  Oh listen, I'm your defense lawyer!
[01:14:48.141 --> 01:14:52.483]  Let me tell you something you need to do, so you never see the boy again!
[01:14:52.503 --> 01:14:57.745]  I mean, folks, this is literally, this is why I get so angry.
[01:14:57.965 --> 01:14:59.166]  Oh, please continue with the story.
[01:14:59.566 --> 01:15:04.849]  Oh, another thing she recommended is I said, she represents my wife, and she said she wouldn't talk to me.
[01:15:05.578 --> 01:15:09.501]  And because I know what they're doing, and I kept coming in there and saying, you can't do that, don't do that.
[01:15:09.521 --> 01:15:10.482]  I'm making them do their job.
[01:15:10.502 --> 01:15:12.284]  They're trying to make her wife sign documents, aren't they?
[01:15:12.304 --> 01:15:13.425]  She told me to go away.
[01:15:13.565 --> 01:15:16.187]  She said, what, your poor little wife can't handle this situation?
[01:15:16.207 --> 01:15:20.571]  Sir, they've got special cops they call in to choke women into signing documents.
[01:15:20.891 --> 01:15:23.894]  I have seen police choking women in Austin.
[01:15:24.154 --> 01:15:25.335]  This is the hell, folks.
[01:15:25.435 --> 01:15:26.116]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:15:26.316 --> 01:15:31.240]  No, I'm telling you, they wanted to isolate her by herself and pat her on the back and get her to do all this stuff, but
[01:15:31.698 --> 01:15:39.100]  I stayed in there with her and they pretty much told me, you just leave your wife here alone with three other children and you go ahead and keep walking across the country.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:40.621]  Can't she handle herself?
[01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:41.421]  She has no car.
[01:15:41.721 --> 01:15:42.401]  She had no money.
[01:15:42.561 --> 01:15:48.063]  You know, it's like they just wanted to split my entire family apart and this was my defense attorney.
[01:15:48.564 --> 01:15:53.666]  And then the other people were saying, oh you're dangerous, you shouldn't have went on the air, you shouldn't have talked about it.
[01:15:53.706 --> 01:15:55.467]  Why you're standing up against us!
[01:15:55.527 --> 01:15:56.628]  That's illegal!
[01:15:56.948 --> 01:15:58.969]  He's speaking out in America!
[01:15:59.449 --> 01:16:00.649]  Oh my God!
[01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.351]  And that's exactly, you know, pretty much what they told me.
[01:16:03.391 --> 01:16:08.913]  Just sit down, shut up, you know, grease your butt, and don't make any waves.
[01:16:08.973 --> 01:16:09.714]  That's what they told me.
[01:16:09.994 --> 01:16:10.594]  And I told them,
[01:16:11.246 --> 01:16:12.287]  You guys aren't helping me.
[01:16:12.347 --> 01:16:13.768]  I have no one to advocate.
[01:16:14.349 --> 01:16:20.654]  The day after it happened, my attorney went on a week vacation while they're giving us UAs.
[01:16:21.155 --> 01:16:22.516]  They're not going to help you.
[01:16:23.197 --> 01:16:25.319]  They tell you, we might give you the child.
[01:16:25.859 --> 01:16:27.440]  Come to our psychiatrist.
[01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:29.022]  Go to our homeless shelter.
[01:16:29.382 --> 01:16:30.623]  Say you're homeless.
[01:16:31.064 --> 01:16:32.425]  Sign this document.
[01:16:32.465 --> 01:16:33.266]  I mean, it's all
[01:16:33.966 --> 01:16:36.269]  The case against you, they're not your advocates.
[01:16:36.309 --> 01:16:37.991]  They're there to get major cash.
[01:16:38.191 --> 01:16:44.739]  Well, we have a hearing on June 28th and they're going to try to throw it all out on jurisdiction.
[01:16:44.779 --> 01:16:50.545]  The case manager that's been getting the most calls called me up pretty fearful yesterday.
[01:16:50.565 --> 01:16:54.249]  I guess a lot of viewers called and expressed their displeasure.
[01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:58.881]  Um, you know, I wish they'd call, like, the county attorney or the S.R.S.
[01:16:58.941 --> 01:17:00.342]  and not this woman, necessarily.
[01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:06.808]  But, anyway, she, um, she said that she was recommending, you know, they, all of them keep saying, we just want you out of this state.
[01:17:06.868 --> 01:17:07.469]  Just get out of here.
[01:17:07.489 --> 01:17:08.170]  And I'm like, fine.
[01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:10.212]  Just get out of here, boy!
[01:17:10.552 --> 01:17:12.214]  You won't cause a problem!
[01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:19.661]  It's always like that when somebody shanghais you, draws first blood, that is a take in your child, and they're always shocked if you fight back.
[01:17:20.473 --> 01:17:30.557]  Well, there were so many times in a physical fight, some bully would, you know, jump out of a car, run up and punch you in the face, and when they're on the ground bleeding, they'll start crying, What'd you do?
[01:17:30.598 --> 01:17:32.058]  My teeth are knocked out!
[01:17:32.318 --> 01:17:34.819]  And it's the same thing, figuratively, with them.
[01:17:35.180 --> 01:17:37.501]  All we did was kidnap your child!
[01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:39.641]  What, you got a problem with us?
[01:17:39.902 --> 01:17:41.502]  Just get out of here, boy!
[01:17:41.522 --> 01:17:43.003]  And I said that to them.
[01:17:43.644 --> 01:17:45.466]  But leave your child with us!
[01:17:45.566 --> 01:17:46.207]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.621]  I'd go to federal prison.
[01:18:00.281 --> 01:18:02.922]  I do not use examples of that, the Hawaiian claim.
[01:18:03.322 --> 01:18:05.784]  Did you hear him threaten our people?
[01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:07.484]  I sure did!
[01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:11.366]  Send out a SWAT team in!
[01:18:11.686 --> 01:18:12.927]  Get him right now!
[01:18:13.007 --> 01:18:13.427]  I'm sorry.
[01:18:13.867 --> 01:18:22.251]  Well, I trust in the Lord, Alex, and we're just, so far, Devin has been protected, and, you know, my wife went visiting this morning.
[01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:25.193]  I removed my other children out of the state of Kansas.
[01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:26.754]  We're no longer there with my wife.
[01:18:26.774 --> 01:18:27.534]  She's by herself.
[01:18:27.990 --> 01:18:29.971]  I didn't want to give them an opportunity to come after me.
[01:18:30.011 --> 01:18:30.751]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:18:30.791 --> 01:18:33.052]  Get your other children as far away from those demons.
[01:18:34.353 --> 01:18:35.333]  Oh my God.
[01:18:35.413 --> 01:18:36.914]  It's just hell on earth, folks.
[01:18:36.934 --> 01:18:37.814]  This is only the beginning.
[01:18:38.955 --> 01:18:40.615]  This is only the beginning of their hell.
[01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:42.016]  Stay there.
[01:18:42.036 --> 01:18:43.356]  I want to talk about this filth.
[01:18:44.197 --> 01:18:46.358]  And then I want these enemies of the Republic.
[01:18:46.838 --> 01:18:51.400]  And then I want to get into the latest attack on free speech.
[01:18:53.857 --> 01:18:54.278]  Attention!

[01:19:53.306 --> 01:19:59.532]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:59.973 --> 01:20:07.761]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.101 --> 01:20:15.949]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.269 --> 01:20:21.011]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.351 --> 01:20:26.052]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.572 --> 01:20:30.434]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:30.914 --> 01:20:31.934]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:20:56.583 --> 01:20:57.103]  are located?

[01:21:54.819 --> 01:21:56.079]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:56.299 --> 01:21:59.140]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:02.261]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:02.801 --> 01:22:09.544]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:22:39.295 --> 01:22:43.197]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:43.317 --> 01:22:44.917]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:12.970 --> 01:23:17.931]  Look, I get all obnoxious to do these hillbilly accents, because I've seen it.
[01:23:18.972 --> 01:23:29.494]  Believe me, and I know I've told this story quite a few times lately, because it's in my mind forever, that we knew this young family that CPS had been harassing before she even had the baby.
[01:23:30.014 --> 01:23:39.757]  No criminal record, he was an auto mechanic, they were living in a really cheap apartment, and then she thought, oh, I'll get some welfare, you know, to help when we have the baby, because it's all advertised.
[01:23:40.797 --> 01:23:42.458]  This was a nice little couple.
[01:23:42.858 --> 01:23:46.100]  They were blue-collar, but they were real sweet people.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:49.602]  We tried to stop them from harassing them.
[01:23:50.502 --> 01:23:54.264]  All of a sudden, they call up Mike Hanson crying.
[01:23:56.225 --> 01:23:57.826]  The cop takes the cell phone away, by the way.
[01:23:58.886 --> 01:23:59.807]  No law, no arrest.
[01:23:59.847 --> 01:24:01.227]  They just don't be contacting people.
[01:24:01.247 --> 01:24:01.848]  They took it away.
[01:24:02.388 --> 01:24:05.450]  We rushed down to the city hospital downtown.
[01:24:09.588 --> 01:24:37.849]  We're walking down the hall, and we have the video camera, we just walk right in, and we open the door, and it was like, Mike's behind me though, he's probably about 10 feet behind me, and as I open the door, she's crying, and the cop has got his hand squeezing on the back of her neck, and then he just looks up, it's like you catch a vampire over somebody's neck, with blood, and I mean, he looked up with his look, and she's crying,
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:42.742]  And they've made the husband go outside, he's running over beside me, and he's going, baby, baby, baby!
[01:24:42.962 --> 01:24:54.367]  And it's this cesarean, you know, baby, perfect little face, you see it there, suckling from her, and the cop is squeezing her neck, saying, sign it, sign it!
[01:24:54.527 --> 01:24:59.089]  And I mean, I'm just, folks, the country is gone, okay?
[01:24:59.767 --> 01:25:01.808]  And he just looked up and said, Get that camera off!
[01:25:01.848 --> 01:25:03.008]  Get out of here!
[01:25:03.628 --> 01:25:05.109]  I have you arrested!
[01:25:05.469 --> 01:25:07.689]  He just came walking right out with pleasure.
[01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:11.050]  He's one of these special cops that's assigned to the CPS there at the hospital.
[01:25:11.571 --> 01:25:12.531]  Does it all day long.
[01:25:12.551 --> 01:25:14.731]  And I was just like, my mouth was hanging up.
[01:25:14.751 --> 01:25:15.872]  I was like, Oh my God!
[01:25:16.272 --> 01:25:18.493]  And folks, I've never cried like that.
[01:25:18.533 --> 01:25:22.894]  When I went outside and was driving home, I even called into some radio talk shows, freaking out, I was going to help the baby.
[01:25:23.514 --> 01:25:33.485]  I mean because that was a big that's when I became a lot more aggressive and a lot more ruthless and a lot more Realizing they are evil scum now.
[01:25:33.505 --> 01:25:36.027]  I know we got our guest here and I'm rambling on I want to take calls later.
[01:25:36.047 --> 01:25:39.351]  So let's let's go back to Raymond Schwab
[01:25:40.422 --> 01:25:42.364]  It's just, what I can't believe is how they're shocked.
[01:25:42.384 --> 01:25:44.405]  They're like, we're taking your child for no reason?
[01:25:44.786 --> 01:25:46.147]  Why are you upset with that?
[01:25:46.607 --> 01:25:58.437]  But finish up with that and let's get into the next segment to the audio of the video that's now up on InfoWars.com of what happened to you guys when they told you it was wiretapping the videotape police.
[01:25:59.498 --> 01:26:07.064]  Sure, and you know Alex, it has been a situation where I've been back and forth, you know, before we decided, when we got this video,
[01:26:07.512 --> 01:26:09.198]  I decided to continue on with the walk.
[01:26:09.258 --> 01:26:11.747]  My wife said, continue on with the walk till we know what's going on.
[01:26:11.767 --> 01:26:12.851]  Devin's in a safe place.
[01:26:12.891 --> 01:26:13.694]  And I was like, okay.
[01:26:14.167 --> 01:26:23.209]  And even then they were telling me, see one hand they're saying, you better stay, and then the other people were telling me, if you go, it's going to look like you're abandoning your wife, and I'm like, well, what am I supposed to do?
[01:26:23.229 --> 01:26:24.370]  Am I supposed to work?
[01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.830]  Not work?
[01:26:24.850 --> 01:26:25.950]  Do you want me to live in a homeless shelter?
[01:26:26.310 --> 01:26:27.971]  It's like the whole thing is arranged.
[01:26:28.131 --> 01:26:34.413]  Plus you're on this mission, you know, this walk, you want to complete this spiritual walk, exposing the war on 9-11.
[01:26:34.713 --> 01:26:42.075]  Yeah, not to mention, to do this walk, we, you know, I sold my business, I had a successful business, I still believe in what we're doing.
[01:26:42.195 --> 01:26:43.375]  You're doing this on faith, yes.
[01:26:43.755 --> 01:26:46.137]  Absolutely, and I believe the same as you.
[01:26:46.157 --> 01:26:54.325]  This country is in such a level of peril that we wanted to put this issue about 9-11, about the evangelicals... And your walk has done that!
[01:26:54.445 --> 01:27:00.270]  By them persecuting you, by them doing this, it's going to draw a thousand times the light it ever would have.
[01:27:00.831 --> 01:27:02.072]  And that's how it works, Alex.
[01:27:02.132 --> 01:27:05.255]  I just hope my child isn't sacrificed for
[01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:12.966]  For what these people are continuing to do, but, you know, her family told me, is it worth what you're doing losing your children?
[01:27:13.006 --> 01:27:17.472]  And I told them, we're going to lose our children anyways if we don't stop these people.
[01:27:18.353 --> 01:27:19.195]  It doesn't matter.
[01:27:19.215 --> 01:27:21.037]  We've already lost them, folks.
[01:27:21.117 --> 01:27:22.359]  America just doesn't know it.
[01:27:22.539 --> 01:27:23.981]  They just haven't come for years yet.
[01:27:25.174 --> 01:27:27.495]  And that's my point exactly.
[01:27:27.515 --> 01:27:29.836]  And I'm going to fight to the bitter end.
[01:27:30.316 --> 01:27:31.496]  I'm going to be there for my son.
[01:27:31.536 --> 01:27:37.118]  If on the 28th of June they continue to hold him in the state of Kansas, Elliot's going to continue walking.
[01:27:37.158 --> 01:27:39.799]  He's going to join with another group that just left from Chicago.
[01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:41.560]  And I'm done.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.161]  I'm going to be back as support.
[01:27:43.201 --> 01:27:44.441]  I'm going to fight for my family.
[01:27:44.701 --> 01:27:46.842]  But they're not going to silence us and we're not going to stop.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:52.661]  Well, that's good, my friend, and make sure we get all those videos before they steal them from you or something.
[01:27:52.881 --> 01:27:53.701]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:27:53.741 --> 01:27:57.422]  We put them in safe places, Alex, as soon as we get away with them.
[01:27:57.782 --> 01:27:59.602]  We get them somewhere where they can't be seized.
[01:27:59.922 --> 01:28:05.424]  Now I'm going to bring Elliot Nash up for just a second, then we'll come back to both of you in the next segment.
[01:28:06.004 --> 01:28:07.284]  Elliot, what is it like for you?
[01:28:07.344 --> 01:28:09.484]  Has this been educational, this walk, for you?
[01:28:09.504 --> 01:28:14.425]  Yeah, I think it's expected that we're going to go through persecution.
[01:28:14.505 --> 01:28:17.346]  Jesus said, when you follow him, you will be persecuted.
[01:28:17.998 --> 01:28:21.639]  And really we need to be praying for these people because they know no better.
[01:28:21.659 --> 01:28:24.980]  They're wicked, and they're dead in their sins, and they're not our enemy.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:29.421]  The devil's our enemy, and he has them right where he wants them, so I'm not surprised.
[01:28:31.162 --> 01:28:32.262]  Well, you're absolutely right.
[01:28:32.282 --> 01:28:39.644]  You're not going to get persecuted in these big mega churches wearing fancy suits, folks, and pinky rings, and talking about the rapture all day.
[01:28:39.664 --> 01:28:41.845]  You're going to be persecuted when you start fighting evil.
[01:28:43.645 --> 01:28:44.565]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.045 --> 01:28:46.546]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.543 --> 01:28:50.324]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:53.317 --> 01:29:57.879]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:29:58.299 --> 01:30:01.220]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:30:01.540 --> 01:30:04.101]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:30:04.481 --> 01:30:09.283]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:30:09.684 --> 01:30:15.046]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:30:15.346 --> 01:30:18.307]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:30:18.487 --> 01:30:19.068]  We're good to go.
[01:30:41.907 --> 01:30:42.347]  We're good to go.
[01:30:53.826 --> 01:30:54.226]  Attention!
[01:30:54.346 --> 01:30:57.147]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[01:30:57.447 --> 01:31:01.748]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[01:31:02.068 --> 01:31:02.748]  Listen closely.
[01:31:02.768 --> 01:31:10.871]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[01:31:11.171 --> 01:31:19.933]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity, energy, memory, and even reproductive health.
[01:31:20.253 --> 01:31:23.114]  Yet, because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country,
[01:31:23.414 --> 01:31:25.756]  No health or healing claims can be made at this time.
[01:31:26.036 --> 01:31:35.503]  However, it is still legal to own this compound, and right now a very small amount is being made available to GCN listeners in what's being called the most amazing and unusual offer ever made on radio.
[01:31:35.703 --> 01:31:41.327]  To claim your supply, set aside for GCN listeners, simply go to www.blacklistedherb.com.
[01:31:41.528 --> 01:31:45.110]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[01:31:45.330 --> 01:31:48.673]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com, or call 877-327-0365.
[01:31:55.457 --> 01:32:01.360]  I want to be clear about something.
[01:32:01.460 --> 01:32:13.344]  Our guests are not walking across the country, Elliot Nash and Raymond Schwab, and mooning the police, or yelling at people, or being obnoxious.
[01:32:13.364 --> 01:32:20.747]  They politely walk down, you know, major highways, state farm roads, by corn fields and wheat fields.
[01:32:21.858 --> 01:32:31.726]  And about half the cops are completely obnoxious, aggressive, hateful, openly saying they have no rights, demanding, poking, prodding at them, threatening them.
[01:32:32.507 --> 01:32:39.012]  Then when the RV shows up, threatening to take his child, harassing him, just hellish.
[01:32:40.549 --> 01:33:04.592]  When they're in a small town standing on a street corner with a sandwich board sign that the Iraq war is bad, cops walk up and say you're not allowed to do that and they go first amendment and they go get out of here get out of our town and they're just you know nice clean-cut guys standing there and they also try to go into the churches and the churches say no we're supposed to lay down to evil and go along with the new world order and they have preachers on tape I mean it shows you
[01:33:06.523 --> 01:33:08.284]  A nation of effeminate scum.
[01:33:08.725 --> 01:33:10.566]  It's not even right to say effeminate, because they're not effeminate.
[01:33:10.586 --> 01:33:18.231]  It's like a... But men that try to be weaklings, who try to be effeminate, it's like false effeminate.
[01:33:18.271 --> 01:33:18.931]  It's really weird.
[01:33:18.951 --> 01:33:19.772]  I don't know how to explain it.
[01:33:19.792 --> 01:33:21.433]  I don't know what term you would use for it.
[01:33:22.694 --> 01:33:23.374]  Nellying.
[01:33:23.895 --> 01:33:27.357]  I don't know what you would call it, but you just always see it in our eyes.
[01:33:27.377 --> 01:33:29.378]  They're like little pig demons or something.
[01:33:30.819 --> 01:33:33.401]  And I just personally have had enough of it.
[01:33:34.555 --> 01:33:52.013]  I haven't had time to watch most of it they've sent us and we've got it piled up over here for when we do make a film and guys get me everything I want it all because it'll be a big part of the film where we cover what's happening to Luke where they're threatening to plant to say he has bombs and saying we know you don't have bombs but we'll say you do and send you to jail
[01:33:53.078 --> 01:33:54.518]  To police threatening to arrest him.
[01:33:54.558 --> 01:33:56.019]  I mean, this is all across the country.
[01:33:56.479 --> 01:34:02.061]  Two weeks ago in Austin, I had the cops say, you can't protest on the street corner, on the sidewalk, on the city streets.
[01:34:02.701 --> 01:34:03.501]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:34:03.961 --> 01:34:06.402]  And then lie and say they didn't say that to the media.
[01:34:06.942 --> 01:34:09.063]  And then mask the riot police to come arrest us.
[01:34:09.423 --> 01:34:11.244]  And I had to threaten to sue every one of those cops.
[01:34:11.304 --> 01:34:13.564]  I said, now listen, I'm a man of my word.
[01:34:13.584 --> 01:34:14.485]  I'm going to sue you.
[01:34:14.505 --> 01:34:17.505]  And you'll probably end up winning the case, but it's going to cost you money.
[01:34:17.946 --> 01:34:19.126]  I'm going to sue you individually.
[01:34:20.097 --> 01:34:26.560]  In the case where they're arguing and having a mutiny, and I heard, and we had cameras up close, and cops going, listen, they got a right to be here, Captain.
[01:34:27.221 --> 01:34:28.721]  We don't want to do that.
[01:34:28.981 --> 01:34:29.882]  He's going to sue us!
[01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:31.783]  You're right I'm going to.
[01:34:32.403 --> 01:34:33.384]  Look, I got rights.
[01:34:33.584 --> 01:34:34.484]  I'm a human being.
[01:34:34.504 --> 01:34:35.485]  Do you understand that?
[01:34:35.505 --> 01:34:36.505]  This is America!
[01:34:37.086 --> 01:34:39.767]  What is it you can't understand about that?
[01:34:40.687 --> 01:34:42.248]  What is your major problem?
[01:34:42.728 --> 01:34:44.469]  I shouldn't have to threaten to sue you.
[01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:47.931]  You should get out of our way and let us live!
[01:34:50.206 --> 01:34:51.026]  I just can't believe it.
[01:34:51.046 --> 01:34:52.027]  I'm going to go back to my guest.
[01:34:53.087 --> 01:35:06.674]  Anything else you want to add, Elliot Nash, or of course, the man whose son's been grabbed, Raymond Schwab, about the audio we're about to hear?
[01:35:06.694 --> 01:35:16.539]  I recommend that you watch the video, but what happens in the video is we were preaching the gospel at a New Age sort of festival.
[01:35:16.559 --> 01:35:18.560]  We didn't go into the festival to be respectful.
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:19.240]  We went outside.
[01:35:19.901 --> 01:35:21.962]  And I would like to point out something, Alex.
[01:35:22.002 --> 01:35:25.404]  There's a website called the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.
[01:35:41.178 --> 01:35:46.581]  And on that website, they have the state-by-state summaries of the laws for wiretapping and eavesdropping.
[01:35:46.901 --> 01:35:53.064]  And under Illinois, it specifically says that a camera is not an eavesdropping device.
[01:35:53.584 --> 01:35:56.966]  Well, let me just stop right there, okay, because I've been through this myself.
[01:35:57.626 --> 01:36:00.708]  Nationwide, they're telling them, and the cops are believing it.
[01:36:01.844 --> 01:36:04.506]  That you can be on the street corner videotaping things.
[01:36:04.586 --> 01:36:07.068]  You can have them pull you over and start videotaping them.
[01:36:07.688 --> 01:36:11.051]  And they will arrest you and they will throw felony charges down on you.
[01:36:11.971 --> 01:36:13.352]  And most people don't know their rights.
[01:36:13.412 --> 01:36:15.534]  The lawyers will actually go plea bargain you.
[01:36:15.694 --> 01:36:16.435]  You pay the lawyer.
[01:36:16.495 --> 01:36:20.117]  He goes and plea bargains to something federally and at every state level.
[01:36:20.197 --> 01:36:20.958]  It's on the books.
[01:36:22.159 --> 01:36:32.789]  That if someone does not have a reason to believe that they had privacy, a reasonable expectation of privacy, then it's not wiretapping.
[01:36:32.849 --> 01:36:36.612]  Also, wiretapping is intercepting a transmission.
[01:36:37.093 --> 01:36:41.537]  Wiretapping would be if you tap into somebody's phone without permission.
[01:36:41.977 --> 01:36:45.000]  Or if you planted a camera in somebody's house because you're a pervert stalker.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.281]  That's wiretapping.
[01:36:46.321 --> 01:36:48.443]  Or if the police do it unlawfully.
[01:36:49.911 --> 01:36:55.693]  I mean, so it's just absolutely amazing that they do things like this.
[01:36:56.354 --> 01:36:59.014]  And they know, they know it's a lie.
[01:36:59.695 --> 01:37:02.576]  That's why they didn't arrest you when you refused to turn your camera off.
[01:37:02.896 --> 01:37:05.837]  It was all just, let's see if we can bully these people.
[01:37:06.297 --> 01:37:17.781]  Which shows premeditated knowledge that they are committing official oppression and human rights and constitutional right violations, civil rights, whatever statute you want to go after them on.
[01:37:18.459 --> 01:37:19.700]  And it shows this darkness.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:20.361]  Please continue.
[01:37:22.442 --> 01:37:47.042]  Well, I just encourage everyone to watch the video, Alex, and we've placed on our website the phone number for the Von Dahlia Police Department that people can call and express their concern for their police state tactics, and we also just received a petition in the email from another organization called Believers Against the War, and apparently they put out a press release to call the mayor of the city to publicly apologize for what they did.
[01:37:48.399 --> 01:37:53.780]  I think it's encouraging for people to spread this video around and let people see what's going on.
[01:37:55.321 --> 01:37:55.941]  Well, I agree.
[01:37:55.981 --> 01:38:07.544]  Before we play the audio of the video, tell us, for the listeners, if you want, if it's okay, the name of your son, the name of your wife, so our listeners can pray for you, and also tell us how we can support you guys.
[01:38:08.685 --> 01:38:17.307]  The name of my son is Devin, and my wife's name is Amelia, and you know, prayer is the greatest support, and we do have
[01:38:18.317 --> 01:38:23.123]  A donation button on our website if people want to donate financially to the walk.
[01:38:23.523 --> 01:38:25.505]  It's www.bateshaloministries.org.
[01:38:26.146 --> 01:38:28.168]  They can always call these people.
[01:38:28.208 --> 01:38:37.619]  I want to wait till after the 28th to see if they give my son back, but people can politely call even the county attorney and express that they're being observed and it's not
[01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:39.229]  Just doing it in darkness.
[01:38:39.269 --> 01:38:40.610]  They can support us in that manner.
[01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:42.891]  Our contact information is on the website.
[01:38:43.571 --> 01:38:44.512]  Just keep us in prayer.
[01:38:44.552 --> 01:38:45.772]  We've been split apart.
[01:38:46.092 --> 01:38:48.513]  I'm separate from my wife now with my other three children.
[01:38:48.553 --> 01:38:49.694]  We're still trying to film.
[01:38:50.114 --> 01:38:51.614]  We just created another video.
[01:38:52.135 --> 01:38:56.977]  And, you know, we're still trying to move forward because we're not going to let these forces stop us.
[01:38:57.037 --> 01:39:01.358]  So, if you can go to the website, bayshalomministries.org, you can donate through that.
[01:39:01.398 --> 01:39:02.019]  Give us a call.
[01:39:02.079 --> 01:39:02.879]  Send us an email.
[01:39:03.299 --> 01:39:04.560]  Just let us know you're out there.
[01:39:06.041 --> 01:39:07.081]  Yeah, we're going to keep fighting.
[01:39:07.702 --> 01:39:15.965]  Well, this is exactly what happened to the apostles and followers of Jesus whenever they tried to preach the word all across the old world.
[01:39:16.585 --> 01:39:19.247]  And it just shows what a wicked Roman system we have become.
[01:39:19.267 --> 01:39:22.628]  I agree Alex.
[01:39:22.668 --> 01:39:27.230]  Now again, tell people this specific town, where this took place in Illinois.
[01:39:27.250 --> 01:39:30.271]  This was Bondalia, Illinois.
[01:39:30.291 --> 01:39:31.292]  It's a really small town.
[01:39:31.312 --> 01:39:34.433]  I think they sent out every police on duty that day.
[01:39:36.198 --> 01:39:38.880]  Well, no doubt they watch 24 and think Al Qaeda is everywhere.
[01:39:38.900 --> 01:39:48.067]  I was on the state capitol yesterday, and I mean just five years ago, just two years ago, the state troopers down there were nice and friendly and at least business-like.
[01:39:48.507 --> 01:39:51.710]  Now they're all crazed and bugging their eyes out and yelling at us.
[01:39:51.790 --> 01:39:55.092]  And I was like, hey, the capitol's all shut down today.
[01:39:55.112 --> 01:39:55.693]  What's going on?
[01:39:55.773 --> 01:39:56.753]  No comment!
[01:39:56.854 --> 01:39:57.594]  Bugging their eyes out.
[01:39:57.614 --> 01:39:59.335]  I'm like, man, just get a life!
[01:40:00.805 --> 01:40:02.727]  They just take themselves so seriously.
[01:40:03.127 --> 01:40:05.169]  But oh, if they see any illegal alien, they just bow down.
[01:40:05.229 --> 01:40:13.555]  Yes sir, I want to bless you, but oh my God, if I find some family, I'll make them pull their stuff out and then not even help them load it back in the car when I search them.
[01:40:13.835 --> 01:40:16.858]  Which we've caught on video, and they had state police run over and tell us to turn the camera off.
[01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:19.680]  I mean, I'm just, this country's so gone, folks.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:20.561]  This is America!
[01:40:20.581 --> 01:40:22.902]  It's not supposed to be a third world cesspit!
[01:40:23.563 --> 01:40:24.624]  I just can't believe it!
[01:40:25.896 --> 01:40:32.660]  Don't you fools know all your burgers and your houses and your cars and your bass boats are because we were a free nation?
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.101]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:34.121 --> 01:40:40.124]  I was going to say, Alex, if they watch the film, they'll notice two of the officers realize I think they're doing something wrong.
[01:40:40.504 --> 01:40:50.290]  As I spoke with them, they kind of walked away because I told them that I didn't want to speak to them anymore, that they were harassing me and they had no reason to stand there surrounding me with their hands on their tasers.
[01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:54.132]  The one officer I had the most conflict with was right in my face the whole time.
[01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:55.900]  I was completely polite with him.
[01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.181]  He wouldn't even shake my hand after we were finished.
[01:40:58.241 --> 01:41:00.701]  I stuck my hand out and said, I don't disrespect you.
[01:41:01.041 --> 01:41:03.342]  And he just said, put his hand behind his back.
[01:41:04.022 --> 01:41:05.222]  I asked for all of their names.
[01:41:05.342 --> 01:41:07.522]  The chief was writing them down on a piece of paper.
[01:41:07.542 --> 01:41:08.683]  He said, just take the paper.
[01:41:08.703 --> 01:41:13.844]  Well, that's why, I mean, a cop walks up to me or pulls me over, and a lot of police have pulled me over.
[01:41:13.864 --> 01:41:15.564]  I'm kind of a speed bug.
[01:41:16.444 --> 01:41:18.865]  And they're nice.
[01:41:18.965 --> 01:41:19.345]  I'm nice.
[01:41:19.445 --> 01:41:21.205]  I'm very nice and polite and congenial.
[01:41:21.767 --> 01:41:27.628]  But man, as soon as they start trying to destroy the Bill of Rights, I get real serious and real cold, real fast.
[01:41:28.628 --> 01:41:32.469]  I actually got mad a few weeks ago because it was just such a lying going on.
[01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:39.870]  But it's just, they don't appreciate the respect is the thing.
[01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:44.971]  Because it is better if you're respectful when you disagree with them because it's more effective, it's stronger, it's more real.
[01:41:46.172 --> 01:41:47.852]  But a lot of times that just makes them even madder.
[01:41:48.456 --> 01:41:49.998]  Because they're bullies, folks.
[01:41:50.018 --> 01:41:52.761]  Guaranteed, people like this were the bullies in school.
[01:41:53.762 --> 01:42:04.033]  And, you know, by the time they got to about 16, 17, 18, they'd messed with the wrong person, and then they thought, well, I've got to be in a bully position where I'm superior now, where I've got a gun.
[01:42:04.813 --> 01:42:05.214]  You see?
[01:42:05.234 --> 01:42:08.938]  Because these bullies end up getting their clocks clean, and they just go get a badge and a gun.
[01:42:09.614 --> 01:42:15.139]  They're like, my God, I beat up this 12-year-old and his 16-year-old brother, the same age as me, kicked my butt.
[01:42:15.659 --> 01:42:17.721]  And they get real upset and they go, I'm gonna be a cop.
[01:42:17.741 --> 01:42:18.802]  And that's basically how it works.
[01:42:19.122 --> 01:42:20.203]  Let's go ahead and go to this clip.
[01:42:20.243 --> 01:42:20.744]  Here it is.
[01:42:22.585 --> 01:42:25.948]  There's still be that man today.
[01:42:26.068 --> 01:42:28.370]  I know there could be out here, but I want to yell at you.
[01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.910]  Yell at you.
[01:42:28.950 --> 01:42:29.731]  Yell at you.
[01:42:29.811 --> 01:42:30.632]  How you doing, guys?
[01:42:30.972 --> 01:42:31.813]  Good, how are you?
[01:42:31.973 --> 01:42:32.914]  I see your identification.
[01:42:33.454 --> 01:42:33.795]  I know.
[01:42:35.592 --> 01:42:38.113]  If I haven't done anything wrong, I'm not going to give you my ID.
[01:42:38.133 --> 01:42:39.154]  I'm not going to ask you again.
[01:42:39.654 --> 01:42:40.615]  That wasn't a request.
[01:42:40.775 --> 01:42:41.795]  Well, what have I done wrong?
[01:42:41.815 --> 01:42:44.077]  I want to see your identification.
[01:42:44.097 --> 01:42:45.137]  What have I done wrong?
[01:42:45.157 --> 01:42:48.199]  You've alarmed and upset some people here.
[01:42:48.239 --> 01:42:49.600]  I want to see your identification.
[01:42:49.740 --> 01:42:59.045]  Is that against the law?
[01:42:59.125 --> 01:43:02.887]  I'm not familiar with either one of you, and I want to see your identification.
[01:43:03.396 --> 01:43:06.478]  If I haven't broken the law, I'm not going to give it to you.
[01:43:06.598 --> 01:43:10.921]  If you can't tell me a law which I have broken, then I will not give you my papers.
[01:43:20.707 --> 01:43:25.550]  I respect what you do, but I also have to hold you accountable to the Constitution, which is the law of the land.
[01:43:27.216 --> 01:43:29.117]  What are you protesting?
[01:43:29.357 --> 01:43:30.857]  We're just preaching the gospel.
[01:43:31.237 --> 01:43:31.777]  The gospel?
[01:43:32.458 --> 01:43:45.762]  It must be like you're protesting those rights, those guys overprotecting your rights.
[01:43:47.542 --> 01:43:50.183]  I'm protesting Christian rights.
[01:43:50.203 --> 01:43:51.063]  Stop right there.
[01:43:51.704 --> 01:43:53.324]  Back that up ten seconds.
[01:43:54.724 --> 01:43:56.225]  They have an anti-war sign.
[01:43:58.175 --> 01:43:59.876]  And so, see, he twists it in his mind.
[01:43:59.916 --> 01:44:04.899]  Looks to me like you're protesting the rights of the guys that are over there protecting those rights.
[01:44:06.460 --> 01:44:14.425]  Looks to me like you're protesting the rights of those guys that are over there protecting those rights.
[01:44:14.445 --> 01:44:21.610]  See, in his head, he just decided, this is some one of them hippies that doesn't want the war.
[01:44:21.690 --> 01:44:23.871]  He's trying to take the men's rights.
[01:44:24.491 --> 01:44:26.813]  Let me tell this pot-bellied cop who's
[01:44:27.572 --> 01:44:30.053]  Practice that tough, fake Clint Eastwood voice.
[01:44:30.893 --> 01:44:31.654]  I'm not asking.
[01:44:31.674 --> 01:44:32.814]  Let me see those papers right now.
[01:44:33.094 --> 01:44:34.675]  Let me tell you something, okay?
[01:44:37.336 --> 01:44:41.838]  A year ago, and this is troops giving a poll in front of their officers, so you can bet it was 90%.
[01:44:41.878 --> 01:44:44.679]  70% said they want out and the war is a fraud.
[01:44:47.299 --> 01:44:50.381]  Now, I've talked to the troops coming back, and I mean, I've talked to officers, too.
[01:44:50.802 --> 01:44:51.482]  They hate it.
[01:44:51.943 --> 01:44:53.304]  They know it's New World Order.
[01:44:53.624 --> 01:44:55.165]  They understand the whole thing.
[01:44:55.205 --> 01:44:57.567]  They know it's a laboratory for war fighting.
[01:44:57.607 --> 01:44:59.148]  They know it's meant to go into Iran.
[01:44:59.668 --> 01:45:07.194]  So, you, as a cop, want to sit there and imagine that you're with the troops and you're defending them over there because they're gallant and they love the war.
[01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:08.215]  Baloney!
[01:45:09.976 --> 01:45:11.257]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:45:11.497 --> 01:45:12.538]  They know it's a lie.
[01:45:12.918 --> 01:45:16.581]  And they know we're going to be there in 20 years because of people like you running this country.
[01:45:17.623 --> 01:45:17.963]  Okay?
[01:45:18.823 --> 01:45:24.165]  So stop wrapping yourself in the name of the Tribes, and stop doing what you're doing.
[01:45:24.945 --> 01:45:27.546]  Let's go ahead and go back to the tape.
[01:45:27.626 --> 01:45:29.887]  We're just preaching the gospel.
[01:45:30.267 --> 01:45:30.907]  The gospel?
[01:45:31.248 --> 01:45:31.508]  Yeah.
[01:45:31.528 --> 01:45:36.529]  Well, it looks to me like you're protesting those rights of those guys over there protecting your rights.
[01:45:46.933 --> 01:45:48.294]  I'm protesting Christians.
[01:45:48.614 --> 01:45:50.634]  I'm not protesting war.
[01:45:50.874 --> 01:45:54.216]  Jesus said there will be wars and rumors of wars, but do not be troubled.
[01:45:55.256 --> 01:45:56.796]  Okay, I'm a religious man too.
[01:45:57.157 --> 01:45:58.737]  I believe you have your rights.
[01:45:59.097 --> 01:46:04.419]  And I'm not here to cause a scene, I'm just here to do my job.
[01:46:04.519 --> 01:46:07.920]  I've been called here to check you guys, okay?
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:11.781]  I'm not making unreasonable requests just to see your identification.
[01:46:11.862 --> 01:46:14.402]  You may be wanted on a warrant or something for all I know.
[01:46:14.482 --> 01:46:14.923]  I'm not.
[01:46:15.183 --> 01:46:15.863]  Stop right there!
[01:46:17.392 --> 01:46:18.333]  They always say that.
[01:46:18.433 --> 01:46:21.935]  I mean, no, they'll have a checkpoint in the middle of nowhere with a hundred cars backed up.
[01:46:21.975 --> 01:46:22.516]  I've been at them.
[01:46:22.936 --> 01:46:26.359]  And I've been sent 50 plus tapes from people that have been at them.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:29.421]  Sometimes it's out of the squad cars.
[01:46:29.441 --> 01:46:30.602]  I don't know where this stuff comes from.
[01:46:32.319 --> 01:46:36.824]  And they'll just be randomly, and they'll walk up and they'll go, well why do you want to search my car?
[01:46:36.884 --> 01:46:38.185]  Why do you want my driver's license?
[01:46:38.686 --> 01:46:41.489]  You stop me here, you don't know what I've done wrong, it's random.
[01:46:41.969 --> 01:46:43.051]  What's your due process?
[01:46:43.071 --> 01:46:44.632]  And they'll go, get out of the car!
[01:46:45.333 --> 01:46:46.334]  We got one of them!
[01:46:46.774 --> 01:46:50.178]  I've got state police in Virginia on tape saying we got one of them.
[01:46:50.759 --> 01:46:54.763]  And they find a pocket constitution and you'd thought they'd found a kilo of cocaine.
[01:46:57.638 --> 01:47:05.402]  And, I mean, this guy is halfway reasonable compared to some of them until they start getting into the threats about wiretapping and threatening felonies on people.
[01:47:06.522 --> 01:47:13.406]  You see, they try to escalate the bull for people standing on a sidewalk in front of a pagan festival.
[01:47:14.006 --> 01:47:18.288]  And again, even if you're a pagan out there and don't like them protesting you, the point is, it's their first amendment right.
[01:47:18.308 --> 01:47:18.648]  Here it is.
[01:47:18.668 --> 01:47:23.711]  You may be wanted on a warrant or something for a one-time thing.
[01:47:24.455 --> 01:47:25.075]  How do I know that?
[01:47:25.095 --> 01:47:26.355]  I don't know who you are.
[01:47:26.395 --> 01:47:29.276]  Well, if I haven't broken the law, you have no right to request my papers.
[01:47:29.536 --> 01:47:31.336]  This is the United States of America.
[01:47:31.356 --> 01:47:34.677]  This is not China or Communist Russia.
[01:47:36.157 --> 01:47:38.438]  If you can tell me a law that I've broken... Can you do me a favor?
[01:47:38.478 --> 01:47:39.578]  Will you shut your camera off?
[01:47:39.838 --> 01:47:41.018]  You don't have permission to record.
[01:47:41.478 --> 01:47:42.879]  Well, this is for my protection.
[01:47:42.899 --> 01:47:44.119]  Do you have the auto on that?
[01:47:44.599 --> 01:47:45.159]  The audio?
[01:47:45.339 --> 01:47:45.519]  Yes.
[01:47:45.579 --> 01:47:45.719]  Yes.
[01:47:45.879 --> 01:47:48.200]  You don't have permission to record my audio.
[01:47:48.860 --> 01:47:49.260]  Why is that?
[01:47:49.280 --> 01:47:50.280]  That's a felony in Illinois.
[01:47:52.677 --> 01:47:58.385]  For you to record my conversation without my permission is a felony.
[01:47:58.866 --> 01:48:03.352]  No, when I'm telling you you can't do it, it's a felony.
[01:48:03.693 --> 01:48:06.016]  You can check into it.
[01:48:06.056 --> 01:48:07.218]  Yeah, I'm just asking.
[01:48:20.918 --> 01:48:24.060]  Can I see your ID, sir?
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:24.280]  Yeah.
[01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:25.841]  And have you got that thing going again?
[01:48:25.901 --> 01:48:28.082]  Well, I wasn't picking up the audio from over here.
[01:48:30.063 --> 01:48:31.264]  This is for my protection.
[01:48:31.384 --> 01:48:33.245]  Okay, for your protection.
[01:48:33.285 --> 01:48:36.947]  Please shut it off, because I don't want my audio being recorded.
[01:48:37.027 --> 01:48:39.088]  And that is a Class 2 felony, I'm telling you.
[01:48:39.108 --> 01:48:41.870]  This is the last time I'm going to give you a warning.
[01:48:44.570 --> 01:48:50.313]  Okay, and then it cuts to the video edit they put up on the web.
[01:48:50.513 --> 01:48:51.854]  So, so there you have it.
[01:48:51.954 --> 01:48:53.335]  They are in a public place.
[01:48:53.415 --> 01:48:58.818]  They are approached by police who festoon their cars and their bodies with cameras and put them everywhere.
[01:48:58.838 --> 01:49:02.301]  And he says, if I say it's wiretapping, it is.
[01:49:03.141 --> 01:49:06.003]  No, you've come into someone's face in a public place.
[01:49:06.823 --> 01:49:11.086]  Now, if he snuck into the bushes in your backyard while you were barbecuing,
[01:49:11.889 --> 01:49:18.271]  And recorded you and your financial planner having a discussion about where you were going to invest your pension money when you retired.
[01:49:18.951 --> 01:49:23.893]  And then you caught him in your bushes with a telescopic microphone recording your conversation.
[01:49:24.193 --> 01:49:27.794]  You might be able to get a wiretapping charge.
[01:49:28.114 --> 01:49:29.454]  You certainly could get a stalking.
[01:49:30.755 --> 01:49:32.615]  We've got the laws, you twit!
[01:49:33.415 --> 01:49:34.296]  You understand that?
[01:49:34.476 --> 01:49:36.876]  We're not all dumb like the general public is.
[01:49:37.097 --> 01:49:38.577]  And we're waking up the general public.
[01:49:40.251 --> 01:49:46.594]  You're the one committing a crime of official oppression and threatening people with false charges and about 20 other things.
[01:49:47.635 --> 01:49:48.295]  It's you!
[01:49:48.895 --> 01:49:51.056]  It's you that broke the law, boy!
[01:49:53.858 --> 01:49:56.999]  It's here.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:50:01.982]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.342 --> 01:50:09.986]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.669 --> 01:50:17.711]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.111 --> 01:50:29.533]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.854 --> 01:50:33.354]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.814 --> 01:50:35.735]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.075 --> 01:50:39.856]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:51:59.231 --> 01:52:01.452]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:52:01.973 --> 01:52:08.177]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:52:08.337 --> 01:52:13.241]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[01:52:13.441 --> 01:52:22.388]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.

[01:53:02.749 --> 01:53:05.790]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:09.131 --> 01:53:10.012]  Inner food, folks.
[01:53:10.052 --> 01:53:11.472]  The best green food out there.
[01:53:11.512 --> 01:53:12.373]  I take it every day.
[01:53:12.453 --> 01:53:13.153]  It's awesome.
[01:53:16.514 --> 01:53:18.596]  You need to give them a call, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:18.636 --> 01:53:20.798]  You need to check out their fine products.
[01:53:20.878 --> 01:53:24.841]  Not just their inner food, but their coffee and all the other products that they have.
[01:53:24.901 --> 01:53:27.183]  It's just amazing stuff.
[01:53:28.424 --> 01:53:33.689]  The FDA and Big Pharma are conspiring to deprive you of the nutrition, energy, and good health that you're entitled to.
[01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:36.531]  Are they concerned about the stress and anxiety levels in your life?
[01:53:36.571 --> 01:53:37.352]  You bet they are.
[01:53:37.912 --> 01:53:43.677]  Because the more you have, the sicker you will be, and the more drugs they can sell you.

[01:54:01.822 --> 01:54:05.204]  We're not going to be shipping them until next month, later next month.
[01:54:14.221 --> 01:54:21.537]  We have the second edition, the final cut to the special edition, whatever you want to call it, of my new terror storm, the History of Government Sponsored Terror.
[01:54:21.557 --> 01:54:22.138]  It's excellent.
[01:54:22.599 --> 01:54:24.343]  We also have America, Freedom to Fascism.
[01:54:25.106 --> 01:54:34.550]  Riddles in Stone, 9-11, Mysteries Demolitions, some of the other great books and videos that we've made or that we've produced or that we carry by other great researchers.
[01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:41.293]  The toll free number is 888-253-3139 to order the books and films.
[01:54:41.733 --> 01:54:44.814]  You can ask about the discounts when you call some of the package deals we've got.
[01:54:45.712 --> 01:54:48.513]  For a limited time, you can still order the original Terror Storm.
[01:54:48.533 --> 01:54:51.413]  We're sending a signed letter, a card with each one.
[01:54:51.433 --> 01:54:52.113]  888-253-3139.
[01:54:52.413 --> 01:54:59.155]  Never forget PrisonPlanet.tv, a wonderful activist tool.
[01:54:59.175 --> 01:55:00.095]  15 cents a day.
[01:55:01.375 --> 01:55:06.696]  And you can download all my films, burn them to disk, DVD, give them to people.
[01:55:06.796 --> 01:55:07.736]  Great activist tool.
[01:55:08.256 --> 01:55:12.337]  My weekly TV reports, my in-studio reports, the Sunday show, we videotape that.
[01:55:13.398 --> 01:55:16.402]  I put my films out several weeks before they're released on DVD there.
[01:55:16.502 --> 01:55:19.185]  Endgame will be there first, coming up in a few months.
[01:55:19.225 --> 01:55:30.278]  PrisonPlanet.tv and your support makes everything we do possible here and that means all the other people we bring up to air so you get a chance to support them as well so it's all part of a larger platform and support system
[01:55:31.334 --> 01:55:34.655]  Kind of a mothership that we form here in the fight against the New World Order.
[01:55:34.975 --> 01:55:42.618]  We are definitely one of the capital ships, one of the aircraft carriers, launching our salvos and sorties into enemy territory 24-7.
[01:55:43.758 --> 01:55:47.940]  So again, get the books, the videos, check them out at the online video bookstore, InfoWars.com.
[01:55:49.651 --> 01:55:57.498]  And if you want to support us in other ways, however you want to support us, you can write to us at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:55:58.058 --> 01:56:01.901]  And we can do a lot more, folks, if we have more support.
[01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:05.004]  So support us by buying the books and videos, however it makes it easier.
[01:56:05.044 --> 01:56:11.649]  You want to send us some RF, some Federal Reserve notes, before they plant the RFIDs in them.
[01:56:12.250 --> 01:56:18.495]  Or if you want to send us some of the checks, whatever, it doesn't matter.
[01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:20.770]  I don't think so.
[01:56:46.363 --> 01:56:54.811]  You can write to us at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 or order via InfoWars.com.
[01:56:55.271 --> 01:56:56.873]  We're going to break, start the third hour.
[01:56:56.893 --> 01:57:00.196]  I'm just going to keep our guest on for five more minutes to talk about what happened in this case.
[01:57:02.038 --> 01:57:08.764]  Not just having the child snatched for the political beliefs, but now cops saying I'm going to charge you with a felony.
[01:57:09.344 --> 01:57:11.566]  I want to talk about how that ended when we get back in about 70 seconds.
[01:57:13.081 --> 01:57:16.304]  And then we're going to open the phones up again for the rest of the third hour.
[01:57:17.545 --> 01:57:20.187]  And I do have some other news I want to get into that I mentioned earlier.
[01:57:20.207 --> 01:57:22.970]  There's a big report up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:57:23.590 --> 01:57:27.513]  New 9-11 study has direct links to government, Pentagon, black ops.
[01:57:28.514 --> 01:57:30.035]  And I got an article here about RFID.
[01:57:30.075 --> 01:57:30.896]  That's why I said that.
[01:57:30.916 --> 01:57:31.737]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:33.518 --> 01:57:37.422]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.762 --> 01:57:38.623]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.947 --> 01:57:50.608]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.268 --> 01:57:52.309]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:54.151]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.811 --> 01:57:55.612]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.373 --> 01:57:57.253]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.954 --> 01:58:01.657]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.118 --> 01:58:04.460]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:58:05.360 --> 01:58:06.140]  Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:11.642]  NORCOM is announcing that they're going to run anti-terror ops against the American people.
[01:58:12.382 --> 01:58:14.523]  All misdemeanors are acts of terrorism.
[01:58:14.543 --> 01:58:15.283]  We'll be getting into that.
[01:58:15.824 --> 01:58:18.464]  Survey says customers not ready for RFID.
[01:58:18.504 --> 01:58:20.185]  It is in trouble globally.
[01:58:20.205 --> 01:58:22.086]  We're going to be going over that.
[01:58:22.146 --> 01:58:23.246]  I've got a bunch of other news here.
[01:58:24.847 --> 01:58:28.088]  But right now we're talking to the men from Beit Shalom Ministries.
[01:58:28.108 --> 01:58:32.069]  We're walking across the country exposing that Christians really shouldn't be for this unjust war.
[01:58:33.098 --> 01:58:46.744]  And the 9-11 is an inside job and Raymond Schwab had his son snatched by CPS because of this in another town in another state when they were at a wedding as punishment for him doing this walk.
[01:58:47.564 --> 01:58:53.186]  Now they told him shut up or they're going to keep him in foster care and not give him back openly.
[01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:55.327]  Just shut up and do what's right or we'll punish the child.
[01:58:55.347 --> 01:58:56.508]  And that's how they operate in America.
[01:58:57.328 --> 01:58:58.969]  And that's how they operated under Stalin too.
[01:58:59.818 --> 01:59:00.078]  Well, Alex,
[01:59:26.264 --> 01:59:33.846]  The only reason we shut it off is because we had just gotten into Illinois and we hadn't had an opportunity to examine the law, she was saying.
[01:59:33.866 --> 01:59:35.426]  We always tell them if they give us the law, we will.
[01:59:35.446 --> 01:59:36.707]  That law is nowhere, okay?
[01:59:36.747 --> 01:59:40.108]  I've looked at all the states, like you said, they've got websites that track it all.
[01:59:40.408 --> 01:59:45.009]  They arrested that guy on felonies up in Pennsylvania, now they're having to drop it and apologize.
[01:59:45.029 --> 01:59:47.889]  They came up to his car, he videotapes them, they arrest him.
[01:59:48.129 --> 01:59:54.271]  It's a bunch of bull, it's a bunch of goons trying to just buffalo us and set the precedent that we don't have any freedom.
[01:59:55.376 --> 02:00:05.181]  And we realize that now, and we made a determination that if it does occur again, we're just going to press the issue until, you know, they have to act upon their threat.
[02:00:05.721 --> 02:00:09.703]  Now what they're going to do is they're going to charge you with resisting, so you've got to go.
[02:00:10.712 --> 02:00:13.194]  Completely jellyfish when that happens.
[02:00:13.214 --> 02:00:16.996]  They may still stomp you good, taser you, even release a dog on you.
[02:00:17.016 --> 02:00:23.359]  We've got video of this where folks lay down, they let dogs attack, they triple taser, then they charge you with assaulting, though you never touch them.
[02:00:23.700 --> 02:00:25.320]  And the false charges are too thick.
[02:00:25.981 --> 02:00:30.824]  They have juries made up of their brothers and sisters, and they just come out and say, kill America, and they drop the gavel.
[02:00:32.565 --> 02:00:33.125]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:36.881]  Uh, and you know, there was just a lot of conversation.
[02:00:36.901 --> 02:00:40.022]  Um, you know, we had a conversation with the people that were complaining.
[02:00:40.222 --> 02:00:45.764]  We actually had someone come up to us beforehand and say, you better get out of here now or else.
[02:00:46.264 --> 02:00:53.906]  And you know, we, I tried to plead with them and say, you realize, and I understand this isn't only about the police, it's about the people in this country.
[02:00:53.946 --> 02:00:59.128]  I told him why, if you believe in freedom, would you,
[02:01:00.091 --> 02:01:05.454]  Initiate police removing peaceful protesters preaching the gospel in your area.
[02:01:05.574 --> 02:01:06.255]  Why would you do that?
[02:01:07.316 --> 02:01:13.139]  You know, and you can hear them in the background saying, we know they can be here, but there's always the but, but we don't want to see this.
[02:01:13.179 --> 02:01:14.740]  Get out, you know, get out of our faith.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:19.483]  But, um, for the most part, we, we eventually complied, gave our ID.
[02:01:19.503 --> 02:01:25.787]  I mean, we do believe that God has established the authorities and we try our best to, uh, we're not going to submit to do evil.
[02:01:26.562 --> 02:01:31.826]  But, you know, we are going to try to come to peaceful resolutions as much as depends on us.
[02:01:32.827 --> 02:01:41.494]  But I did warn them that there would be further action with what we were doing if they were wrong, and they assured me that nothing was going to happen to them.
[02:01:44.176 --> 02:01:47.259]  Elliot, do you have anything to add?
[02:01:47.699 --> 02:01:50.121]  Well, like you said earlier, the country is gone.
[02:01:50.261 --> 02:01:52.964]  There's no hope left, and we're guilty until proven innocent.
[02:01:53.979 --> 02:02:02.005]  If we're guilty, if he thinks that we could have, you know, if we have a warrant out for our arrest, then why doesn't he check everybody else at the festival?
[02:02:02.185 --> 02:02:14.393]  Just because we're protesting, they came to us, and what it boils down to is they hate the truth, they hate the light, whether it be the truth about the war, or 9-11, or our risen Lord, Jesus Christ.
[02:02:14.573 --> 02:02:16.335]  What was this, a magic Christmas?
[02:02:16.795 --> 02:02:18.596]  I mean, a magic crystal sale?
[02:02:19.717 --> 02:02:20.698]  Actually, it was a...
[02:02:21.733 --> 02:02:23.615]  It was an American-type celebration.
[02:02:23.655 --> 02:02:33.446]  They had like old, uh, we filmed some drum corps dressed up like, um, revolutionary drummers in the Patriot Army.
[02:02:34.007 --> 02:02:36.149]  So it's pretty, uh, interesting.
[02:02:36.169 --> 02:02:37.751]  But they also had Indian dancers.
[02:02:37.771 --> 02:02:38.792]  Well, I want to hear about this.
[02:02:38.812 --> 02:02:39.713]  You said it was New Age.
[02:02:39.733 --> 02:02:40.814]  I want to hear about it.
[02:02:41.075 --> 02:02:42.997]  Just a few more minutes and then we'll go to your calls, folks.
[02:02:47.449 --> 02:02:51.932]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:02:52.292 --> 02:02:56.374]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:02:56.674 --> 02:02:57.215]  We listened.
[02:02:57.535 --> 02:03:02.517]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:03:02.798 --> 02:03:03.278]  We listened.
[02:03:03.658 --> 02:03:06.700]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:03:07.120 --> 02:03:07.660]  We listened.
[02:03:08.121 --> 02:03:12.163]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:03:12.543 --> 02:03:13.043]  We listened.
[02:03:13.384 --> 02:03:18.628]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:03:19.028 --> 02:03:20.389]  Again, we listened.
[02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:22.331]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:03:22.531 --> 02:03:28.076]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:03:28.536 --> 02:03:31.178]  Get the Berkey Lite at the American Water Purifier.
[02:03:31.379 --> 02:03:31.579]  Only $279.
[02:03:31.639 --> 02:03:32.219]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[02:03:32.259 --> 02:03:32.500]  That's 888-03-4438.
[02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:34.181]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:03:34.201 --> 02:03:35.162]  Now yet available in Iowa.
[02:03:47.595 --> 02:03:50.757]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:03:51.097 --> 02:03:53.058]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:03:53.418 --> 02:04:01.082]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:01.762 --> 02:04:08.805]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.206 --> 02:04:16.109]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:04:16.573 --> 02:04:20.616]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:20.936 --> 02:04:24.439]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:24.899 --> 02:04:26.580]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:31.123]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.435 --> 02:04:48.718]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[02:04:48.958 --> 02:04:53.801]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:04:54.061 --> 02:04:55.402]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:04:55.562 --> 02:04:58.945]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?

[02:05:19.354 --> 02:05:20.295]  No animal testing.
[02:05:20.535 --> 02:05:21.855]  I use them and love them.
[02:05:21.875 --> 02:05:23.476]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[02:05:23.756 --> 02:05:24.916]  And I say big time.

[02:05:46.305 --> 02:05:51.848]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:13.991 --> 02:06:17.234]  Alright, we've got a lot of phone lines and I appreciate our guest holding with us.
[02:06:17.274 --> 02:06:18.235]  Bates Cologne Ministries.
[02:06:18.295 --> 02:06:21.318]  Links to them up on InfoWars.com right now.
[02:06:21.338 --> 02:06:22.119]  End of the video.
[02:06:22.139 --> 02:06:24.081]  The police coming up.
[02:06:24.141 --> 02:06:25.583]  I want to see your ID.
[02:06:25.603 --> 02:06:26.684]  No, no crimes were committed.
[02:06:27.064 --> 02:06:28.205]  You don't have probable cause.
[02:06:28.245 --> 02:06:29.567]  I'm not guilty until proven innocent.
[02:06:29.967 --> 02:06:30.868]  Let me see your ID.
[02:06:31.849 --> 02:06:32.850]  Turn that camera off.
[02:06:32.890 --> 02:06:33.671]  Don't record me.
[02:06:34.271 --> 02:06:37.855]  That's a second degree felony violation of wiretapping.
[02:06:39.432 --> 02:06:45.838]  No, wiretapping is without a warrant what your criminal president does with impunity against the American people.
[02:06:46.379 --> 02:06:47.600]  And then nothing happens to him.
[02:06:47.960 --> 02:06:49.161]  That's wiretapping, Bubba.
[02:06:51.624 --> 02:06:52.945]  I've actually looked at the laws.
[02:06:52.965 --> 02:06:53.906]  I know the laws.
[02:06:56.545 --> 02:07:15.110]  Now, a couple states, New York, Connecticut, and I think two more have passed it, but I want to say, because I'm going from memory, I looked it up about a year ago, have passed wiretapping where if you call somebody on the telephone and you're recording the private conversation, that that is an intercept.
[02:07:16.091 --> 02:07:17.671]  But those have even been thrown out of court.
[02:07:18.611 --> 02:07:20.492]  So that's about as wide as it's gotten.
[02:07:21.747 --> 02:07:24.748]  And I've had cops walk up to me and go, you can't tape me, that's wiretapping.
[02:07:24.788 --> 02:07:26.909]  And I just go, you know what, I'm going to continue.
[02:07:27.689 --> 02:07:37.492]  And by the way, I happen to know that you're misconstruing what the wiretapping law is and you have no reasonable expectation of privacy here.
[02:07:37.532 --> 02:07:38.392]  You're in my face.
[02:07:38.912 --> 02:07:41.413]  If you don't like being on camera, just get out of my face.
[02:07:42.013 --> 02:07:44.294]  You like trying to do what you do in the dark.
[02:07:44.874 --> 02:07:50.016]  And I really am upset by you trying to violate the Bill of Rights and lie to me right now and lie to yourself.
[02:07:52.481 --> 02:07:55.002]  I mean, I added to the Austin Cop, I said, and you're a scumbag.
[02:07:55.022 --> 02:07:58.663]  I said, you're a scumbag, degenerate, liar.
[02:07:59.504 --> 02:08:00.064]  And he was!
[02:08:00.864 --> 02:08:13.688]  He walked up to a peaceful demonstration, about a hundred people, in front of the Omni Hotel, where Governor Rick Perry was on the program note to be there, and he was there, by the way, they lied and said he wasn't, and later we proved he was there, and we heard him announcing him inside on the loudspeaker.
[02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:19.230]  First, the cops walked up and said, hey, you guys need to go, this is the wrong place, you've got the wrong place to go, we have the HEB
[02:08:21.227 --> 02:08:25.829]  Golf Classic handout right here.
[02:08:25.849 --> 02:08:28.851]  It says Rick Perry.
[02:08:30.112 --> 02:08:31.232]  Governor's office told us we'd be here.
[02:08:31.272 --> 02:08:38.376]  We know people that work at this hotel that issued the invitations to him and his family and that he is coming.
[02:08:38.416 --> 02:08:38.896]  He is here.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:52.704]  And the cops said, okay, whatever Mr. Conspiracini walks off, and you know, the other cops are nice enough, and they just follow their orders, and he comes back over, and we got this from three camera angles, we haven't put it on YouTube yet, we've been so busy finishing Endgame, but it'll get up there, don't worry.
[02:08:52.724 --> 02:08:55.185]  I'll put it on local TV, too.
[02:08:55.205 --> 02:08:59.106]  I don't even have to say a word, it's all, it's all voiced by the cops.
[02:08:59.647 --> 02:09:01.887]  Listen, I need you to go ahead and go, or you're going to be arrested.
[02:09:02.768 --> 02:09:03.708]  I don't want to have to arrest you.
[02:09:05.214 --> 02:09:08.556]  And I get on the bullhorn and I say, the police have now threatened to arrest us if we don't leave.
[02:09:08.576 --> 02:09:11.758]  And I did their intimidation for me, but I wasn't going to not tell our people.
[02:09:11.778 --> 02:09:15.861]  I wasn't going to just let them stand there and maybe get arrested.
[02:09:15.901 --> 02:09:17.302]  And so I said, for those that want to go, go.
[02:09:17.342 --> 02:09:19.884]  For those that want to stay, stay.
[02:09:19.904 --> 02:09:21.425]  About 40 of our 100 people left.
[02:09:22.446 --> 02:09:25.568]  We even then got cops on tape going, hey, that worked pretty good when you said that.
[02:09:25.588 --> 02:09:26.548]  Look, a bunch of them left.
[02:09:27.629 --> 02:09:30.131]  And it was kind of a celebration of deception and laughing.
[02:09:30.531 --> 02:09:32.552]  You know, deceiving, destroying America is fun.
[02:09:32.612 --> 02:09:33.333]  It's very enjoyable.
[02:09:34.245 --> 02:09:35.466]  And, uh, it's all pleasurable.
[02:09:36.286 --> 02:09:46.530]  And, uh, then all of a sudden more cops show up, paddy wagons show up, they mass about a hundred police, they're all getting, having arguments and discussing what they should do, and all of a sudden this reporter runs over to him.
[02:09:46.550 --> 02:09:49.431]  I mean, I've told this like five times, and I'm telling it more to tell right now because it's important.
[02:09:49.811 --> 02:09:51.652]  He runs over and he goes, hey, the cops say you're lying.
[02:09:51.692 --> 02:09:53.912]  They say that he didn't threaten to arrest you.
[02:09:54.733 --> 02:10:00.935]  And I walk right over with the camera and I go, did you just tell the reporter that you didn't threaten to arrest us and we didn't leave?
[02:10:01.355 --> 02:10:03.336]  And he goes, that's right, I didn't threaten to arrest anybody.
[02:10:04.102 --> 02:10:10.246]  He looks right at the cameras, right at the press, and I just said, you are degenerate scum!
[02:10:11.187 --> 02:10:22.955]  Not only do you try to violate my Bill of Rights, that our forefathers fought and died for, that is the heart of America, then you go lie to the newspaper about me!
[02:10:23.895 --> 02:10:27.698]  You are degenerate scum, and that is degenerate!
[02:10:29.631 --> 02:10:32.012]  You don't just try to butcher the Bellarites!
[02:10:32.433 --> 02:10:36.615]  You go around bearing false witness on people, and you think it's funny!
[02:10:36.635 --> 02:10:38.076]  It isn't funny!
[02:10:38.096 --> 02:10:41.518]  Alright, I'm sorry.
[02:10:41.578 --> 02:10:45.000]  Gentlemen, just in closing comments, what happened after the tapes went off?
[02:10:45.281 --> 02:10:46.461]  Closing comments on what happened.
[02:10:48.022 --> 02:10:51.884]  We went to the police station, and they were trembling.
[02:10:51.925 --> 02:10:57.548]  We said we were an independent media organization, that we were going to post that contact on the web, and they couldn't cite a law.
[02:10:58.021 --> 02:11:06.967]  They actually said, eavesdropping, and basically they're just trying to intimidate us, bully us out of... Wait a minute, so you turned your cameras off, but you went to the police station to complain?
[02:11:08.007 --> 02:11:08.247]  Right.
[02:11:09.908 --> 02:11:13.491]  And they were trembling, because again, we're a nation of cowards now.
[02:11:13.751 --> 02:11:15.832]  The general public are cowards, the cops are cowards.
[02:11:16.152 --> 02:11:19.895]  It shocked them that actual slaves would come in and complain.
[02:11:19.915 --> 02:11:24.778]  Yeah, and also the officer that was giving me the hardest time,
[02:11:26.525 --> 02:11:37.829]  Came in while I was talking to the lieutenant and the lieutenant was actually more reasonable then because the people weren't watching him and he told me, look, I've been doing this for 30 years and he said, I do agree with some of where you're coming from.
[02:11:37.869 --> 02:11:39.230]  He said, I've seen it all change.
[02:11:39.590 --> 02:11:40.750]  It's not the same today.
[02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:44.391]  Um, almost like he's just trying to get out with his skin alive.
[02:11:44.671 --> 02:11:45.212]  You know what I mean?
[02:11:45.232 --> 02:11:48.813]  Just from the, the way law enforcement has changed.
[02:11:48.853 --> 02:11:51.674]  But at the same time I told him, but you got to understand what you're doing is wrong.
[02:11:52.424 --> 02:12:00.941]  And, uh, the other officer came in and saw me and took off his glasses and his eyes got all big like, this guy actually is going to follow through with this and, you know, I told him when I was talking to him...
[02:12:01.741 --> 02:12:04.443]  He got my face and he kept saying, why would you want to do this?
[02:12:04.823 --> 02:12:06.144]  What are the point of these signs?
[02:12:06.204 --> 02:12:07.425]  And I just asked him point blank.
[02:12:07.465 --> 02:12:09.066]  I said, are you Christian, sir?
[02:12:09.506 --> 02:12:12.328]  And he said, I don't feel obligated to discuss my religion with you.
[02:12:12.348 --> 02:12:21.434]  And I said, well, then neither do I. Well, that's the incredible thing is they'll ask you questions and then you say something back and they act like, oh, how dare you ask me a question?
[02:12:21.454 --> 02:12:23.576]  And it's none of your business, cop.
[02:12:23.656 --> 02:12:24.757]  What sign he's got?
[02:12:24.777 --> 02:12:25.777]  This is America.
[02:12:26.118 --> 02:12:28.019]  What is it about that you can't get?
[02:12:29.577 --> 02:12:32.700]  I just ask people to pray for them and pray for this country.
[02:12:33.381 --> 02:12:48.615]  And again, as I've said before, Alex, this isn't only about the police, it's about the people of this country that are allowing themselves to be enslaved and allowing the police to do this and calling the police and wanting to have this dominant police state system over them so they can just
[02:12:49.085 --> 02:12:54.888]  Watched Friends and Sidney Popcorn and just ignored that our country is going into the toilet and we're losing everything.
[02:12:54.908 --> 02:12:55.328]  Oh, no, no, no.
[02:12:55.368 --> 02:12:55.728]  I agree.
[02:12:55.748 --> 02:13:04.272]  The greater evil was the scum that called the cops, thinking it's illegal to protest, and the cops are still obligated to show off once they get there.
[02:13:05.472 --> 02:13:08.634]  I mean, the Austin cops had the Omni Hotel saying, arrest them, get them out of here.
[02:13:09.234 --> 02:13:13.216]  And they had to look powerless because they couldn't do what the corporate people said.
[02:13:13.516 --> 02:13:15.537]  But let me tell you, the Austin cops made the right decision.
[02:13:16.454 --> 02:13:23.779]  They made the right decision to not, you know, it's sad that I had to threaten them with lawsuits for them to do the right thing, but they did the right thing.
[02:13:24.359 --> 02:13:37.308]  We had officers in Johnson County, Kansas, the church called the police on us that we were out in front of, and the officers told them, we are here to defend their rights and to make sure that they don't break the law concerning your church, but we're not going to do anything about them.
[02:13:37.348 --> 02:13:39.170]  And they told me that, you know,
[02:13:40.174 --> 02:13:43.336]  They were going to make sure we didn't get harassed, and they were going to make sure everybody was safe.
[02:13:43.756 --> 02:13:52.141]  But, you know, there are officers out there... So in that town, in that town in Kansas, they knew what the Bill of Rights says and how they're supposed to operate?
[02:13:52.201 --> 02:14:01.727]  They were defenders of the Bill of Rights and the defenders of our rights to stand there on the sidewalk and speak the truth of what's going on in this country, and I respect them for that.
[02:14:01.867 --> 02:14:06.930]  What percentage of the hundreds of protests you've done now, or I don't know how many you've done, is it a hundred yet?
[02:14:08.095 --> 02:14:15.361]  Uh, we constantly, we walk with our signs everywhere, so this is a... I mean, how many businesses, uh, churches have you stood in front of?
[02:14:15.421 --> 02:14:16.823]  I mean, I'm just trying to get a ballpark.
[02:14:16.903 --> 02:14:17.583]  Under a hundred.
[02:14:17.603 --> 02:14:18.804]  Fifty?
[02:14:18.844 --> 02:14:19.605]  Sixty something?
[02:14:19.625 --> 02:14:20.045]  Sure, sure.
[02:14:20.065 --> 02:14:20.686]  We've done a lot.
[02:14:20.966 --> 02:14:21.407]  We've done a lot.
[02:14:21.427 --> 02:14:23.408]  Okay, let's say fifty churches you've stood in front of.
[02:14:23.929 --> 02:14:26.491]  How many of them have the police behave themselves?
[02:14:28.793 --> 02:14:29.093]  Wow.
[02:14:29.674 --> 02:14:30.414]  Not very many.
[02:14:30.474 --> 02:14:34.598]  Most of them, most of them are very aggressive towards us and offended.
[02:14:35.528 --> 02:14:48.217]  One actually called us off-duty and posed as a police officer on duty saying that we were going to get arrested for making threats when all we threatened is we called and told them we were going to protest in front of their church.
[02:14:48.537 --> 02:14:51.779]  That's now a threat in America worthy of criminal investigation.
[02:14:51.799 --> 02:15:01.326]  Then I found out he wasn't even on duty and was actually... What about the goon on tape running around with stains on his shirt with a gun in his belt?
[02:15:03.227 --> 02:15:04.408]  Yeah, that guy was off-duty.
[02:15:05.491 --> 02:15:11.354]  That guy was off-duty and when we went to talk to the sheriff about him, the sheriff just said, uh, that's how we do things around here.
[02:15:11.875 --> 02:15:15.076]  And, uh, you know, we proceeded to tell the sheriff, uh, I don't care how you do things around here.
[02:15:15.096 --> 02:15:22.900]  This is the United States of America and, uh, you can't just have off-duty officers in plainclothes stuffing guns in their pants, uh, getting out and IDing people.
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:26.542]  We had camera equipment, you know, and he could have been anybody.
[02:15:27.022 --> 02:15:34.126]  And it's, uh, I can say for the most part, and this is why we've been more resistant as we've walked, is that, um, we're seeing that,
[02:15:35.038 --> 02:15:44.745]  Across, this is across the board in every city in every state that we've been in and there are very few that actually just come up and say, hey, I was just seeing if you guys are okay.
[02:15:44.865 --> 02:15:46.726]  Okay, don't ID us, don't ask for anything.
[02:15:47.006 --> 02:15:53.691]  But there still are officers out there that know they're not there to police everybody and check their ID and do random searches.
[02:15:53.911 --> 02:15:56.092]  You know, they're there to enforce the law.
[02:15:56.573 --> 02:15:59.134]  And so, you know, I praise the Lord for those officers.
[02:15:59.214 --> 02:16:04.578]  But it is, I would say the percentage of contacts that are unconstitutional that we have is probably
[02:16:05.123 --> 02:16:06.144]  Around 90 percent.
[02:16:08.325 --> 02:16:10.186]  It'll get worse and worse before it gets better.
[02:16:10.306 --> 02:16:14.408]  Alright, gentlemen, thank you so much for spending time with us and we'll pray for you and your family.
[02:16:15.188 --> 02:16:15.568]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:15.608 --> 02:16:16.028]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:16:16.068 --> 02:16:16.809]  The Lord bless you.
[02:16:17.089 --> 02:16:17.749]  You too, guys.
[02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:22.952]  And get me all those videos because then I know what to work with when I make this next film.
[02:16:22.972 --> 02:16:25.473]  It'll probably end up being 20 minutes of a two-hour film I'm going to make.
[02:16:26.093 --> 02:16:31.296]  Just showing different facets of the 9-11 Truth Movement and the unbelievable persecution.
[02:16:31.883 --> 02:16:35.906]  It'll be a film about 9-11, be a film about the police state, and a film about the state of this country.
[02:16:37.127 --> 02:16:40.069]  And just about activism in America.
[02:16:45.052 --> 02:16:46.133]  It tears my guts out.
[02:16:47.734 --> 02:16:48.675]  It really does.
[02:16:49.816 --> 02:16:53.298]  To know that we're in, I mean, we don't have a good future ahead of us.
[02:16:56.140 --> 02:16:58.762]  Because they're going in the opposite direction of liberty.
[02:17:00.345 --> 02:17:03.266]  And a lot of these officers, they think they're really helping the country.
[02:17:03.306 --> 02:17:04.726]  They think acting like this is good.
[02:17:06.687 --> 02:17:07.167]  And it's not.
[02:17:09.547 --> 02:17:15.028]  And the 30 million extra illegals that are going to pour in on top of what's already here with this amnesty will bankrupt the states even worse.
[02:17:15.088 --> 02:17:18.169]  And then they tell the cops, go out and route even more tickets.
[02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:21.110]  I mean, frankly, I don't like having to look at your face.
[02:17:22.443 --> 02:17:31.553]  You know, when the illegal aliens are driving past me drunk at 90 and you let them go and I'm five miles over the speed limit and you give me a ticket and want to search my car and want to breathe on me with your green teeth.
[02:17:31.573 --> 02:17:34.396]  I'm like one cop in Pleasanton.
[02:17:35.237 --> 02:17:37.159]  Guaranteed to have the IQ of a maggot.
[02:17:38.501 --> 02:17:42.826]  I'm one of the government ships in the narcotics, but you're all high and mighty on us, aren't you?
[02:17:47.682 --> 02:17:51.826]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:17:52.046 --> 02:17:53.807]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:17:54.067 --> 02:18:00.373]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:18:00.653 --> 02:18:06.778]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:18:07.019 --> 02:18:08.780]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:09.060]  We're good.
[02:18:23.797 --> 02:18:26.579]  Hi, this is Tom Andrew with Midas Resources, your source for gold and silver.

[02:18:56.109 --> 02:19:00.192]  Significant daily gains in precious metals are not uncommon during volatile times.

[02:21:56.451 --> 02:22:08.335]  Alright, I'm going to have a news blitz coming up before the show ends and right now we're going right to your calls.
[02:22:08.415 --> 02:22:09.275]  Who's up first here?
[02:22:11.776 --> 02:22:13.457]  Joshua in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[02:22:13.517 --> 02:22:13.997]  Go ahead.
[02:22:15.057 --> 02:22:15.877]  Yes, Alex.
[02:22:16.218 --> 02:22:19.078]  Thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to speak to you.
[02:22:19.098 --> 02:22:19.979]  Thanks for calling in.
[02:22:20.019 --> 02:22:20.579]  What's on your mind?
[02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:28.976]  Well, first I want to give my heart out prayer to Raymond and his family because we are also going through a similar situation.
[02:22:31.238 --> 02:22:38.443]  I wanted to tell you and your listeners what has happened to my brother and what the so-called justice system has done to him.
[02:22:38.463 --> 02:22:41.825]  Alright, what have the criminal forces done?
[02:22:41.865 --> 02:22:42.446]  Tell us about it.
[02:22:43.006 --> 02:22:48.050]  His wife took his one-year-old kid in with a bruise on his head and
[02:22:50.194 --> 02:22:52.995]  Accused him, you know, of inflicting the bruise.
[02:22:53.996 --> 02:22:56.036]  Well, see, that's because the country's falling apart.
[02:22:56.056 --> 02:22:56.777]  Doesn't that fool?
[02:22:56.997 --> 02:23:02.479]  She had no idea what was going to happen to her, but all these ads in women's magazines tell you that the men are all evil.
[02:23:02.539 --> 02:23:03.560]  Report them immediately.
[02:23:03.640 --> 02:23:03.880]  Okay.
[02:23:04.080 --> 02:23:05.260]  Yeah, you watch Fox News.
[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:10.382]  You know, men are just stupid Homer Simpsons and, you know, family guy.
[02:23:10.483 --> 02:23:14.604]  Anyway, so my brother had no idea that warrant was even out for his arrest.
[02:23:15.124 --> 02:23:18.686]  He wasn't even there at the time the supposed accusation happened.
[02:23:19.491 --> 02:23:28.314]  He ended up turning himself in and spent a year in a county jail, you know, waiting for his speedy trial that we are all given.
[02:23:29.595 --> 02:23:37.117]  Once the trial came, what was very interesting was, see, we're very poor, so we couldn't hire, you know, an attorney.
[02:23:37.197 --> 02:23:38.298]  We had a public defender.
[02:23:39.238 --> 02:23:47.621]  The judge in the case was a ex-girlfriend of my half-brother's father, who was a chief of police.
[02:23:48.559 --> 02:23:58.001]  Now, there was no jury, and I'm not a big, fancy lawyer, but I know that if any member of the jury had any kind of relationship with the defendant, they wouldn't be on the jury.
[02:23:58.521 --> 02:24:00.181]  But why was there a judge?
[02:24:00.281 --> 02:24:01.522]  Why did they have a jury trial?
[02:24:02.702 --> 02:24:04.702]  Well, that's a whole other story.
[02:24:04.722 --> 02:24:06.302]  Because people perish for lack of knowledge.
[02:24:06.322 --> 02:24:08.183]  You guys know nothing, or didn't know anything else.
[02:24:08.423 --> 02:24:10.203]  Well, this happened ten years ago.
[02:24:10.243 --> 02:24:13.964]  He's been sitting in prison right now for ten years, but it gets worse than this.
[02:24:14.932 --> 02:24:15.792]  So there was no jury.
[02:24:15.852 --> 02:24:18.634]  I was very young at the time, so I have no idea what's going on, you know.
[02:24:20.274 --> 02:24:27.317]  The wife, after, you know, being in relationship with the... with his... You gotta finish the story.
[02:24:27.337 --> 02:24:28.618]  You gotta finish the story.
[02:24:29.018 --> 02:24:29.378]  I'm sorry.
[02:24:29.798 --> 02:24:32.519]  Gave him a 60-year sentence for a bruise.
[02:24:33.720 --> 02:24:43.224]  Two 30-year consecutive sentences for child abuse, one being a bruise and the other being the accusation of him spanking his child.
[02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:49.093]  He has spent 10 years in prison with the 60 year sentence on top of it.
[02:24:50.113 --> 02:24:56.236]  And I just thought that I should probably let you and your listeners know that this does happen all over the country.
[02:24:56.276 --> 02:24:56.716]  Oh, I know.
[02:24:56.957 --> 02:24:57.737]  Write up your case.
[02:24:57.757 --> 02:24:58.257]  Send it to us.
[02:24:58.277 --> 02:24:58.898]  We'll post it.
[02:24:59.278 --> 02:25:00.138]  His name, everything.
[02:25:00.178 --> 02:25:01.119]  I appreciate your calls.
[02:25:01.139 --> 02:25:03.220]  Send it all to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:06.721]  2 A's or Submissions at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:06.762 --> 02:25:07.602]  That is now up.
[02:25:07.622 --> 02:25:09.563]  We're checking that and getting those up.
[02:25:12.338 --> 02:25:13.099]  I'm not trying to be rude.
[02:25:13.139 --> 02:25:14.760]  I seem to hurry through all the other victims.
[02:25:15.240 --> 02:25:22.026]  Oh yeah, there are people who serve 50 years in jail for marijuana.
[02:25:23.547 --> 02:25:26.270]  And then they'll have other cases where they serve a month and they'll put that on the news.
[02:25:26.330 --> 02:25:30.213]  A murderer served four years and somebody who spanked their child served 20.
[02:25:30.373 --> 02:25:32.535]  And then spanking isn't even illegal.
[02:25:33.936 --> 02:25:36.618]  And I mean, my wife talks to yuppies all the time.
[02:25:36.678 --> 02:25:39.621]  I mean, who are well-to-do, middle class, make hundreds of thousands a year.
[02:25:40.385 --> 02:25:45.531]  And they can have 50 witnesses at the playground that the child fell off the jungle gym and broke their finger or foot.
[02:25:45.711 --> 02:25:46.512]  They don't care.
[02:25:46.532 --> 02:25:48.775]  They walk in, the judge just laughs.
[02:25:49.836 --> 02:25:51.118]  You got witnesses, huh?
[02:25:51.838 --> 02:25:58.766]  I've got case officers here that have sworn out affidavits that they think you're a danger.
[02:25:58.786 --> 02:25:59.848]  Now listen.
[02:26:00.876 --> 02:26:02.558]  Your child's in our custody right now.
[02:26:03.179 --> 02:26:06.382]  Sign these forms and I'll allow you to visit in the next month.
[02:26:07.343 --> 02:26:07.964]  Don't cry.
[02:26:08.605 --> 02:26:10.547]  You cry, I'm going to hold you in contempt.
[02:26:11.008 --> 02:26:14.692]  And then the judge has to, like, feel like an evil pleasure.
[02:26:15.353 --> 02:26:15.934]  We're good to go.
[02:26:39.666 --> 02:26:48.009]  And I mean, and Judge Jean Meir will actually pause and go, mmm, oh, and just actually have evil pleasure spasms on the bench.
[02:26:48.049 --> 02:26:48.950]  You've got to go see her.
[02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:50.630]  You think I'm kidding?
[02:26:50.970 --> 02:26:53.031]  Go see Judge Jean Meir in court, folks.
[02:26:54.192 --> 02:26:56.132]  I haven't seen her in years because I couldn't handle it anymore.
[02:26:56.152 --> 02:27:02.915]  I've been down there like five times, and I mean, she'll sit there while people are crying, and she'll go, mmm, oh, it's like she's getting the energy or something.
[02:27:03.735 --> 02:27:05.476]  Mmm, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[02:27:07.012 --> 02:27:09.094]  And then the eyes are just like, so evil.
[02:27:09.354 --> 02:27:15.358]  I mean, it's just... And they've got their special little Nelly bailiffs that run the whole op.
[02:27:17.599 --> 02:27:20.842]  It is, uh... It is bad, folks.
[02:27:21.642 --> 02:27:24.024]  But one has to see it for themselves to know it.
[02:27:25.024 --> 02:27:27.086]  And I mean, she's just there, feeding.
[02:27:28.046 --> 02:27:30.168]  Feeding and feeding and feeding.
[02:27:35.985 --> 02:27:38.986]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.006 --> 02:27:42.707]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.809 --> 02:27:50.770]  Hello, I'm Dr. Bill Diegels, a Nutromedical Report here on Genesis after Alex Jones 2-4 Monday to Friday.
[02:27:51.111 --> 02:27:59.354]  Develop the first line of defense kit to block pathogenic infective organisms to give you day-to-day protection as well as infection protection against biological and chemical weapons.
[02:27:59.434 --> 02:28:00.654]  Defense tabs block virus
[02:28:00.694 --> 02:28:01.235]  We're good to go.
[02:28:18.294 --> 02:28:23.535]  Defense wipes will kill all the pathogenic viruses and bacteria on contact and are safe for you and your loved ones.
[02:28:23.655 --> 02:28:31.196]  So get a first-line defense kit and protect yourself from daily pathogens and from civil defense from biological, chemical, and toxic weapons.

[02:28:36.357 --> 02:28:38.318]  That's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com or call us at 888-212-8871.
[02:28:38.338 --> 02:28:40.118]  Stay well and protect your loved ones today!
[02:28:46.374 --> 02:28:46.994]  Morning, neighbor!
[02:28:47.014 --> 02:28:47.715]  Hey!
[02:28:48.135 --> 02:28:49.056]  Shouldn't you be at work?
[02:28:49.476 --> 02:28:49.796]  I am.
[02:28:50.056 --> 02:28:52.038]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[02:28:52.258 --> 02:28:52.918]  What do you mean?
[02:28:52.938 --> 02:28:56.000]  Well, I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:58.382]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[02:28:58.522 --> 02:28:59.683]  But I never have to go to work.
[02:28:59.963 --> 02:29:00.903]  So, what do you do?
[02:29:01.204 --> 02:29:02.304]  Not very much at all now.
[02:29:02.604 --> 02:29:04.426]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[02:29:04.446 --> 02:29:05.306]  It's got a funny name.
[02:29:05.346 --> 02:29:08.088]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:29:08.408 --> 02:29:09.409]  That is funny.
[02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:14.273]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[02:29:14.833 --> 02:29:16.915]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[02:29:17.075 --> 02:29:19.797]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[02:29:19.998 --> 02:29:20.678]  You should log on.
[02:29:20.818 --> 02:29:22.700]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:24.321]  So, what was that website?
[02:29:24.421 --> 02:29:31.387]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait, I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[02:29:31.747 --> 02:29:32.788]  You don't need to write it down.
[02:29:32.848 --> 02:29:33.729]  It's easy to remember.
[02:29:33.970 --> 02:29:37.314]  DidYouRobBillGates.com Yeah!
[02:29:37.674 --> 02:29:41.318]  DidYouRobBillGates.com That is easy!
[02:29:41.659 --> 02:29:42.159]  It's easy?
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:44.302]  And the money is awesome!
[02:29:46.161 --> 02:29:50.204]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:29:50.424 --> 02:29:53.827]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:29:54.007 --> 02:29:57.510]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:29:57.750 --> 02:30:01.013]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:30:01.033 --> 02:30:06.497]  This basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we see.
[02:30:06.537 --> 02:30:11.762]  When we do our program, you know, in herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill.
[02:30:12.142 --> 02:30:12.843]  We're good to go.
[02:30:23.556 --> 02:30:28.040]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:30:28.080 --> 02:30:29.441]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:30:29.601 --> 02:30:33.985]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[02:30:34.105 --> 02:30:35.806]  That toll-free number again, 1-877-928-8822.
[02:30:35.847 --> 02:30:40.811]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:02.185 --> 02:31:08.733]  All right, we're going to go to Ava and Ben and Kathy and Rob.
[02:31:08.793 --> 02:31:10.675]  I'll at least get to those four calls before the show ends.
[02:31:10.735 --> 02:31:12.417]  I've got a few articles on RFID.
[02:31:13.610 --> 02:31:18.171]  On how they want to use Cribs domestically, now admitting it, what we've already known for years, according to this Northcom.
[02:31:18.732 --> 02:31:21.492]  Some other key news here, but I did want to get the sponsor.
[02:31:21.512 --> 02:31:24.893]  He's been a sponsor for a couple months now, and I had a chance to talk to him.
[02:31:25.413 --> 02:31:28.454]  About three years ago, he tried to get in touch with me, never could, about being a sponsor.
[02:31:28.474 --> 02:31:32.836]  I'm glad I finally contacted him, because my wife got some samples of it and loved it.
[02:31:33.596 --> 02:31:34.996]  Everybody I knew was talking about it.
[02:31:35.136 --> 02:31:40.798]  I'd eaten green foods before, and they'd either give me a stomachache, or make me feel high as a kite, like I had ten cups of coffee, or
[02:31:41.542 --> 02:31:42.062]  We're good to go.
[02:31:58.283 --> 02:32:03.869]  It is just fantastic to have Mr. Sinclair, Steve Sinclair, on with us from InnerFood.
[02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:16.962]  Tell us how you got into the company, what the company is, what is in, just one of your products, your main product, InnerFood, in these nice little cases that it comes in.
[02:32:17.904 --> 02:32:20.245]  Well, thanks Alex for having me on.
[02:32:20.305 --> 02:32:33.989]  It's great to be on the show and the InnerFood, the way we got started, we had just been having green drinks and had kind of the same experience you had and there was a lot of junk showing up in a lot of the products.
[02:32:34.849 --> 02:32:42.712]  So, we decided to do something better and, you know, most people, you know, they take a lot of healthy things and people tell them, well,
[02:32:43.396 --> 02:32:47.220]  You know, over two or three months it'll work and, you know, it's an incremental thing.
[02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:48.581]  Nobody ever realizes it.
[02:32:49.362 --> 02:32:55.088]  And, you know, we looked at, you know, the American lifestyle and people are stressed out.
[02:32:55.368 --> 02:33:01.174]  They don't have good nutrition because of all the processed foods and even fresh foods doesn't have the content that it used to.
[02:33:02.516 --> 02:33:11.424]  And so we came up with something that people can really feel immediately, the energy boost, and then over time, you know, it does do all of those things to your body.
[02:33:11.464 --> 02:33:13.325]  We've got 20 different ingredients in it.
[02:33:14.146 --> 02:33:25.776]  You know, spirulina, chlorella, vegetarian nutritional yeast, your B vitamin, you know, the dulse, kelp, barley grass, wheat grass, alfalfa leaves, spinach, rose hips, beetroot,
[02:33:26.832 --> 02:33:40.123]  Orange peel, winter cherry root, and some other adaptogenic herbs that help to, you know, straighten out your liver, your digestive system, your adrenals, which, you know, as you probably know, most of our adrenals are burned up.
[02:33:41.505 --> 02:33:45.388]  So, you know, we kind of formed our company around that one product.
[02:33:46.068 --> 02:33:51.493]  You know, with the coconut milk powder, that's another product that, you know, it's a
[02:33:53.297 --> 02:33:57.839]  You know, it's a fat that's not stored in your body, but it's burned as energy.
[02:33:58.599 --> 02:34:01.440]  It increases metabolism, just like the inner foods.
[02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:04.381]  Oh yeah, my wife loves the coconut stuff.
[02:34:04.922 --> 02:34:10.324]  Oh yeah, well you know that's... You know, you're talking about losing weight, not even really trying.
[02:34:11.024 --> 02:34:16.486]  Not getting hungry, that's because it's supplying nutrition, and it's increasing your metabolism.
[02:34:18.007 --> 02:34:21.108]  So it's just burning off that fat that you have right now.
[02:34:22.199 --> 02:34:32.042]  So, we're just trying to keep everybody up in their energy and, you know, when your body's healthy and you have good nutrition, your immune system's being fed, you know, the whole thing.
[02:34:32.102 --> 02:34:40.425]  And then, you know, we've come up with that Nutri-Cafe, the coffee product that, you know, if you're going to drink coffee, you might as well drink a healthy coffee.
[02:34:40.445 --> 02:34:48.067]  And we put compounds in there that actually do boost your immune system and help you have a little bit increased performance level.
[02:34:48.167 --> 02:34:51.828]  It helps you assimilate oxygen a little bit better, so it increases stamina.
[02:34:52.799 --> 02:34:55.720]  And we've just been adding products that are central around that.
[02:34:56.281 --> 02:35:09.346]  Immune assist, you know, for Hep C, HIV, and just a general immune boost, and then another one for critical care for cancer type stuff.
[02:35:10.107 --> 02:35:14.909]  You know, we're just trying to supply really quality products that actually work.
[02:35:16.489 --> 02:35:17.830]  That's our main goal.
[02:35:22.057 --> 02:35:28.402]  How do people get the main product, Interfude, and how long will a keg of it last them?
[02:35:29.442 --> 02:35:30.083]  How do you take it?
[02:35:30.143 --> 02:35:30.843]  Explain it to people.
[02:35:31.224 --> 02:35:32.244]  Well, thanks Alex.
[02:35:32.505 --> 02:35:33.766]  It's two-year shelf life.
[02:35:34.986 --> 02:35:42.132]  And, you know, one of the best ways to get a really great price is to go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on our banner.

[02:35:47.836 --> 02:35:51.038]  The Interfude and the Coconut Powder Combo, we call it.

[02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:26.160]  I think so.

[02:37:02.715 --> 02:37:04.576]  Mainly the Interfood, again, is a central product.
[02:37:04.616 --> 02:37:05.417]  The other stuff's great.
[02:37:07.819 --> 02:37:09.180]  The other products that he was talking about, 866-762-9238.

[02:37:10.381 --> 02:37:10.421]  866-762-9238.

[02:37:29.054 --> 02:37:32.575]  866-762-9238 or enerfood.com.
[02:37:33.055 --> 02:37:36.377]  Well, Mr. Sinclair, thank you for coming on, and it's great to have you as a sponsor.
[02:37:36.797 --> 02:37:39.658]  Well, thank you, and it's a privilege to be a sponsor.
[02:37:39.698 --> 02:37:40.899]  We need to get the word out.
[02:37:40.979 --> 02:37:49.763]  We need people to get interested in what's going on, find out the facts for themselves, and take some action.
[02:37:50.496 --> 02:37:51.016]  Absolutely.
[02:37:51.056 --> 02:37:51.937]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:37:51.977 --> 02:37:52.317]  Take care.
[02:37:52.337 --> 02:37:53.037]  Thank you, sir.
[02:37:53.217 --> 02:37:53.417]  Bye-bye.
[02:37:54.138 --> 02:37:56.519]  And just one more final word on the inner food.
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.401]  My wife loves it.
[02:38:01.761 --> 02:38:07.263]  I have never been a big vitamin person, and I tried all the other green drinks, and they taste horrible, even with orange juice or apple juice.
[02:38:07.663 --> 02:38:16.987]  This stuff doesn't taste wonderful, but it tastes the best of anything I've had in orange juice or apple juice, and it gives you scary amounts of energy because it's just nutrients.
[02:38:17.027 --> 02:38:18.628]  It's not a bunch of speed fillers.
[02:38:19.278 --> 02:38:20.839]  Like a lot of the other things that make you sick.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:23.061]  And I'm taking it.
[02:38:23.241 --> 02:38:23.722]  I like it.
[02:38:23.742 --> 02:38:24.502]  I forgot today.
[02:38:24.522 --> 02:38:26.024]  I probably take it three times a week.
[02:38:26.064 --> 02:38:27.044]  I need to make myself.
[02:38:27.064 --> 02:38:27.745]  I'm not in the habit.
[02:38:28.165 --> 02:38:32.709]  I'm not hungry in the morning and then I'm not even really thirsty in the morning and then I usually get hungry by about lunch.
[02:38:32.729 --> 02:38:34.110]  I need to keep it here at work is what I need to do.
[02:38:34.130 --> 02:38:35.791]  I'm just mixing it with apple juice like I do at home.
[02:38:36.232 --> 02:38:41.096]  Because when I do take it, and I have felt the difference in the last month taking it, it's just amazing stuff.
[02:38:41.316 --> 02:38:42.457]  And I know you're in the same way.
[02:38:42.477 --> 02:38:45.159]  We're too busy to think about ourselves, but we need to make
[02:38:45.865 --> 02:38:48.208]  Time to do this.
[02:38:48.228 --> 02:38:51.611]  866-762-9238 or enerfood.com.
[02:38:51.992 --> 02:38:54.454]  Give them a call right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:38:54.915 --> 02:38:57.597]  Alright, let's go back to the calls as promised.
[02:38:58.478 --> 02:39:00.000]  And who's up next again?
[02:39:00.020 --> 02:39:01.662]  I keep getting my call lists mixed up here.
[02:39:02.903 --> 02:39:04.825]  Ava in British Columbia, you're on the air.
[02:39:05.486 --> 02:39:06.567]  Hey there, how's it going?
[02:39:06.787 --> 02:39:07.648]  Great, thanks for holding.
[02:39:08.579 --> 02:39:09.420]  Oh, no problem.
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:17.985]  Hey, I just wanted to let you know that I can really identify with your caller, the ones who are having trouble with the Child Protective Services.
[02:39:18.125 --> 02:39:22.067]  I'm a survivor of that whole mind game.
[02:39:22.187 --> 02:39:22.627]  The year was 1985.
[02:39:23.048 --> 02:39:26.930]  I was raised in an upper middle class home, so of course this knows no
[02:39:27.412 --> 02:39:28.933]  Socio-economic boundary.
[02:39:28.953 --> 02:39:31.474]  It doesn't matter if you're from a blue-collar family.
[02:39:31.494 --> 02:39:32.894]  That's why we always make this point.
[02:39:32.914 --> 02:39:34.115]  That's why we always make this point.
[02:39:34.295 --> 02:39:41.918]  Is that when the government starts doing no-due process and kidnappings to the middle class and the rich folks, we're in deep decline.
[02:39:41.938 --> 02:39:42.238]  Go ahead.
[02:39:42.258 --> 02:39:47.080]  I was raised in a nice home on the lakeshore, upper middle class family in Canada, the whole bit.
[02:39:47.140 --> 02:39:50.041]  And we have what's called the Children's Aid Society up here.
[02:39:50.081 --> 02:39:51.182]  Same thing as CPS.
[02:39:51.902 --> 02:39:53.302]  And confluence of events.
[02:39:53.382 --> 02:39:54.463]  Parents were divorcing.
[02:39:54.523 --> 02:39:57.064]  I was truant from school, although I was a straight-A student.
[02:39:57.526 --> 02:40:01.927]  They interfered in our lives due to truancy laws at the time.
[02:40:02.328 --> 02:40:03.548]  Education wasn't as progressive.
[02:40:03.568 --> 02:40:04.648]  Nobody was homeschooling.
[02:40:05.509 --> 02:40:06.709]  They said it was against the law.
[02:40:06.749 --> 02:40:11.570]  They ended up taking me out of my home and put me in their quote-unquote system, which was a total culture shock, obviously.
[02:40:13.151 --> 02:40:19.373]  Anyway, ended up in one of those experimental places, run through the hospital for emotionally challenged youth.
[02:40:19.393 --> 02:40:24.154]  You know, I was always a counter-revolutionary from the time that I was born, I think.
[02:40:24.194 --> 02:40:25.815]  I knew what was going on and called them out.
[02:40:26.445 --> 02:40:35.308]  Anyway, um, I'll never forget the day that I stood there in front of the administrator and he said to me, you're not leaving this place until you think the way that we say that you should think.
[02:40:36.308 --> 02:40:39.329]  Literally said that to me and I'm 12 years old and I said, you know what?
[02:40:39.869 --> 02:40:44.931]  I'll die here before I think the way that you want me to think and you're going to let me go.
[02:40:45.467 --> 02:40:46.487]  I fought for my freedom.
[02:40:46.527 --> 02:40:47.108]  I resisted.
[02:40:47.128 --> 02:40:47.828]  It took me a year.
[02:40:47.848 --> 02:40:49.909]  I was 12 years old.
[02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:52.309]  They ended up at the very end of this.
[02:40:52.349 --> 02:40:52.990]  It wasn't a sin.
[02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:54.190]  I committed no crime.
[02:40:54.250 --> 02:40:55.590]  I was only a 12-year-old little girl.
[02:40:56.111 --> 02:40:59.652]  They ended up, the staff members, of course, were just completely brainwashed.
[02:40:59.772 --> 02:41:00.012]  I mean,
[02:41:00.712 --> 02:41:04.473]  I knew that they had no, they were just kids really in their early 20s.
[02:41:04.553 --> 02:41:06.573]  I mean, you know, just fresh out of college.
[02:41:06.613 --> 02:41:08.874]  And most of them were abused.
[02:41:09.114 --> 02:41:10.194]  Most of them were abused.
[02:41:11.414 --> 02:41:13.715]  And so they're getting back at daddy or mommy.
[02:41:14.235 --> 02:41:16.996]  And see, everybody is the bad daddy or mommy.
[02:41:17.456 --> 02:41:19.076]  And so they're punishing everyone.
[02:41:19.556 --> 02:41:21.157]  They are the mental patients, but go ahead.
[02:41:21.177 --> 02:41:22.777]  But I'm a 12 year old little girl.
[02:41:23.257 --> 02:41:35.322]  But I mean, at this point, I mean, I was born a warrior and I looked into the eyes of sheer unmitigating evil when I looked into the eyes of that director and they made it clear, you're not leaving here until we fix your mind.
[02:41:35.442 --> 02:41:38.243]  So how did it end?
[02:41:39.243 --> 02:41:46.126]  Um, you know, they ended up, ultimately, I mean, there were incidents where I was injected with haloperidol, which is the strongest anti-psychotic drug at the time.
[02:41:46.166 --> 02:41:48.026]  I don't know if you're aware of what that is.
[02:41:48.887 --> 02:41:50.267]  I basically fought for my freedom.
[02:41:50.287 --> 02:41:52.468]  I was sent to a behavioral modification facility.
[02:41:53.061 --> 02:41:54.403]  This tore my family apart.
[02:41:54.443 --> 02:41:56.084]  Devastated mother, sister, father.
[02:41:56.425 --> 02:41:57.826]  We're still all split up to this day.
[02:41:57.926 --> 02:42:00.028]  Then they sent you to a brainwashing facility.
[02:42:00.048 --> 02:42:01.149]  Yeah, they just devastated.
[02:42:01.209 --> 02:42:03.552]  But, you know, I'm basically a rogue.
[02:42:03.592 --> 02:42:04.793]  I mean, I fought for my freedom.
[02:42:04.853 --> 02:42:05.494]  I said, you know what?
[02:42:06.855 --> 02:42:09.336]  I'll die before I let you have my mind.
[02:42:09.777 --> 02:42:13.278]  I understand when I was 12 I probably would have challenged him too.
[02:42:13.798 --> 02:42:15.579]  It's better, and I'm not saying you're bad.
[02:42:15.619 --> 02:42:18.240]  In fact, I admire you and I'm sure it made you stronger what you went through.
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:21.101]  Instead of letting them destroy you, you can actually use it as a lesson.
[02:42:21.942 --> 02:42:25.883]  The thing is, at the time, you're young and you've got that fighting spirit.
[02:42:25.943 --> 02:42:26.764]  I know, exactly.
[02:42:27.164 --> 02:42:29.205]  I would have done the same thing, but today being an adult,
[02:42:29.765 --> 02:42:40.709]  You just play their game, tell them what they want to hear, and know the whole time they're enemies, and that you're going to get into a position in life to defend others and lead a charge against them.
[02:42:41.329 --> 02:42:45.010]  All of that is how we're going to get the high ground, and then we're going to punish them.
[02:42:45.570 --> 02:42:53.753]  And we're going to do it through the Bill of Rights and through the Constitution, but it's when you're in their clutches, it's best to just give them no energy.
[02:42:54.696 --> 02:42:57.197]  I absolutely have to do that, and I was fighting a battle for myself.
[02:42:57.277 --> 02:43:00.337]  These parents, though, I want to let you know that it's a perpetuating cycle.
[02:43:00.818 --> 02:43:08.720]  I ended up, I'm 35 now, and I have a beautiful son, but they attempted in later years to interfere in my life just to gain.
[02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.461]  These people just tend to, I mean, they have some kind of a sonar device, I swear.
[02:43:13.041 --> 02:43:16.642]  And I basically prevented them from doing that by taking a really hard-line stance.
[02:43:16.682 --> 02:43:21.783]  But what I want to say to these people is what somebody said to me when I was forced to fight for my child.
[02:43:22.532 --> 02:43:23.893]  Um, you know, just ridiculous charges.
[02:43:23.953 --> 02:43:24.774]  I was a vegetarian.
[02:43:24.794 --> 02:43:26.455]  They said he needs meat, some kind of thing.
[02:43:26.515 --> 02:43:27.616]  Bullshit trumped up charges.
[02:43:28.397 --> 02:43:30.539]  I hear you, ma'am, but I'm going to let you go.
[02:43:30.599 --> 02:43:33.501]  Listen, I really appreciate your call and thank you for calling into the show.
[02:43:33.521 --> 02:43:48.693]  Uh, yeah, I mean, look, but the whole thing is we don't need to get, here's the deal, I yell and scream and get mad and get aggressive, but out then in the real world, we need to be cold about it because when we get all excited and angry and you did wrong, they're just waiting for us to make the wrong move.
[02:43:50.115 --> 02:43:50.355]  Okay?
[02:43:51.889 --> 02:43:54.291]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ben in Chicago.
[02:43:54.351 --> 02:43:55.011]  Ben, you're on the air.
[02:43:55.031 --> 02:43:57.053]  Hi, can you hear me?
[02:43:57.793 --> 02:43:58.634]  Yes, Ben, go ahead.
[02:43:58.654 --> 02:44:03.317]  Hi, I just had a couple books and an observation I wanted to share.
[02:44:04.017 --> 02:44:07.320]  A couple books, some ammo for the Info War, if you will.
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:11.302]  The first book, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America.
[02:44:11.583 --> 02:44:19.348]  Charlotte Isserby, Deputy Director of the Department of Education, opened meetings about how they were going to brainwash and destroy America's youth's minds.
[02:44:20.382 --> 02:44:20.842]  Exactly.
[02:44:20.862 --> 02:44:26.466]  I mean, if you look at this as like a war... They have actual handouts showing how they're going to turn us into zombies.
[02:44:26.486 --> 02:44:27.507]  They actually say it.
[02:44:27.987 --> 02:44:30.729]  She has Department of Education internal documents.
[02:44:30.769 --> 02:44:31.690]  It is not our opinion.
[02:44:31.710 --> 02:44:33.511]  It is to turn us into zombies.
[02:44:33.531 --> 02:44:33.912]  Go ahead.
[02:44:34.672 --> 02:44:34.852]  Right.
[02:44:34.872 --> 02:44:45.660]  I mean, if you look at it like a war between, I don't know, like the elites and the masses, you know, the first thing in a war you can, you know, confuse the enemy, shut down their, you know, command and control center.
[02:44:46.140 --> 02:44:49.863]  So, you know, they're dumb and, I mean, like the book says, deliberate
[02:44:50.593 --> 02:44:51.793]  The deliberate dumbing down.
[02:44:52.054 --> 02:44:53.874]  Scientifically focused.
[02:44:54.654 --> 02:44:54.814]  Right.
[02:44:54.834 --> 02:44:58.356]  I mean, going back a hundred years, it's very interesting.
[02:44:58.456 --> 02:45:09.659]  They took the freest, most intelligent, highest test scores, the majority of the inventions, almost all the wealth, the most dynamic, beautiful people in the world and turned us into demon creatures.
[02:45:09.739 --> 02:45:10.019]  Yes.
[02:45:10.959 --> 02:45:11.840]  Yeah.
[02:45:12.700 --> 02:45:18.842]  The other book, Programmed to Kill, the politics of serial murder.
[02:45:19.502 --> 02:45:20.823]  That's by David McGowan.
[02:45:22.804 --> 02:45:31.650]  It's a well-researched book, and it's sort of an insight into some of the depravity that's out there.
[02:45:31.770 --> 02:45:35.812]  And shows like 24 and all this are meant to program us to be psychopaths.
[02:45:37.153 --> 02:45:38.174]  Well, yeah.
[02:45:38.254 --> 02:45:43.617]  This book really gets into more like some of the weird ties that you'll see between
[02:45:44.521 --> 02:45:48.744]  Uh, you know, the government and various brainwashing programs and some of the... No, I know.
[02:45:48.804 --> 02:45:50.265]  I've actually read a synopsis of the book.
[02:45:50.305 --> 02:45:53.727]  I haven't read it, but, you know... Yeah, I mean, it's very...it's very weird.
[02:45:53.767 --> 02:46:03.893]  Like, for example, the link between Henry Lee Lucas, the only guy that Bush pardoned from death row, and, you know, his links to the Bush family.
[02:46:04.994 --> 02:46:07.716]  Uh, very, very in-depth.
[02:46:08.656 --> 02:46:09.617]  It's sick, my friend.
[02:46:10.137 --> 02:46:11.098]  I appreciate your call.
[02:46:11.118 --> 02:46:11.538]  Anything else?
[02:46:12.883 --> 02:46:14.684]  Just one more point.
[02:46:16.964 --> 02:46:22.506]  If you look at, like I said, sort of a war between the elites and the masses.
[02:46:22.546 --> 02:46:30.048]  The elites, they don't care so much about getting more money, but they want to obtain and secure their power.
[02:46:31.669 --> 02:46:38.871]  One way, though, that they can weaken us is to make our money situation worse.
[02:46:39.531 --> 02:46:42.312]  For example, the immigration bill, it'll cost
[02:46:42.896 --> 02:46:49.300]  Upwards of two trillion dollars, but... I mean, when you look at already the debt that the U.S.
[02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:56.445]  has in both public and private, that's around, one number I saw from last year, it was 87 trillion.
[02:46:56.965 --> 02:46:59.547]  That's like $300,000 a person.
[02:47:00.027 --> 02:47:01.368]  Sure, I appreciate your call.
[02:47:02.809 --> 02:47:11.134]  Yeah, legalizing the illegal aliens, the 30 million, letting them bring in their family members to be initially legalized, the states are already completely bankrupt.
[02:47:12.660 --> 02:47:16.062]  But with more federal mandates, more federal mandates to totally take over.
[02:47:17.864 --> 02:47:24.208]  They're bankrupt, and then they tell the cops, go out, write more tickets, grab more children, you won't have your jobs, blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:24.849 --> 02:47:28.411]  And they go, we gotta go out and do it, or we won't have jobs, and that's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:47:29.372 --> 02:47:32.614]  It's all, it's just, it's cold-blooded.
[02:47:33.635 --> 02:47:41.080]  And the new old order says, yeah, we're the elite, we're in the positions of power, we are having the effect, we are the ones that are taking over.
[02:47:42.217 --> 02:47:45.599]  And we're doing this because we have a right to rule.
[02:47:47.100 --> 02:47:51.362]  We're doing this because we're going to win.
[02:47:51.782 --> 02:47:56.685]  And by hook or by crook, they see it as a strength.
[02:47:57.726 --> 02:48:01.408]  They see it as an attribute that they're completely ruthless.
[02:48:03.048 --> 02:48:05.710]  And they see you and I as weak because we love.
[02:48:07.364 --> 02:48:12.665]  And they got a bunch of brainwashed do-gooders out there serving them who can't see the forest for the trees.
[02:48:13.505 --> 02:48:17.006]  Who can't see the big picture of what they're involved in.
[02:48:20.166 --> 02:48:25.887]  And if there's any solace to the bad things that are happening and the even worse things to come, it's this.
[02:48:26.987 --> 02:48:32.508]  So much of the scum that serves this system is going to be crushed first by their own masters.
[02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:35.709]  So many of the good old boys that went along with this
[02:48:36.491 --> 02:48:40.693]  And the liberals and the rest of them are going to be caught in their own trap.
[02:48:41.653 --> 02:48:43.734]  We'll be right back, we'll talk to Kathy and Rob.
[02:48:43.754 --> 02:48:54.039]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.419 --> 02:49:02.022]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.734 --> 02:49:09.797]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.197 --> 02:49:21.622]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.922 --> 02:49:25.443]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:25.883 --> 02:49:27.824]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.144 --> 02:49:31.926]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:55.277]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[02:49:55.537 --> 02:50:06.767]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw, stagnant pond water, into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[02:50:07.087 --> 02:50:12.812]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:50:13.032 --> 02:50:19.676]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:19.916 --> 02:50:26.739]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:28.781]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:50:29.021 --> 02:50:31.102]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[02:50:31.142 --> 02:50:31.402]  Get it?
[02:50:31.442 --> 02:50:32.103]  We're good to go.
[02:50:45.242 --> 02:50:46.964]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:50:47.184 --> 02:50:50.889]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:50:51.209 --> 02:50:53.431]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[02:50:53.952 --> 02:51:00.159]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:51:00.319 --> 02:51:05.205]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[02:51:05.405 --> 02:51:14.413]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:51:14.754 --> 02:51:20.739]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[02:51:46.449 --> 02:51:49.171]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.191 --> 02:51:53.133]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.935 --> 02:52:08.841]  Up on PrisonPlanet.com and JonesReport.com we have the Hillary Clinton clip where Senator talks about her and Boxer talking about how they've got to restrict and shut down talk radio.
[02:52:08.861 --> 02:52:11.802]  And of course the neocons are all jumping on that.
[02:52:11.842 --> 02:52:13.383]  What about Trent Lott saying that?
[02:52:13.894 --> 02:52:17.175]  What about Tony Blair saying restrict the internet news?
[02:52:17.275 --> 02:52:20.117]  I mean, they're all doing it across political parties.
[02:52:20.157 --> 02:52:21.537]  It isn't a left-right situation.
[02:52:21.917 --> 02:52:30.321]  But they do want to shut down and start restricting free speech because alternative talk radio is starting to take over in small ways, but getting inroads into mainstream talk radio.
[02:52:31.581 --> 02:52:35.103]  And the majority of callers are now anti-New World Order, pro-Ron Paul.
[02:52:35.943 --> 02:52:41.085]  And so the neocons can't gauge or control it anymore, and so you see Republicans calling for its restriction.
[02:52:41.716 --> 02:52:42.357]  We're good to go.
[02:53:02.982 --> 02:53:06.125]  Out of UK, customers not ready for RFID.
[02:53:06.645 --> 02:53:14.272]  It says that 80 plus percent of companies are adopting RFID, but that the people are almost universally against it.
[02:53:15.132 --> 02:53:16.113]  That's some good news.
[02:53:16.854 --> 02:53:19.796]  I'll have to cover it all Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:53:19.836 --> 02:53:24.761]  I'll be live Central Standard Time out of the studios of News Radio 590, KLBJ.
[02:53:25.621 --> 02:53:28.364]  And I do want to thank everybody that came out to the event last night.
[02:53:28.464 --> 02:53:30.405]  The Alamo Draft House, I want to thank them as well.
[02:53:30.465 --> 02:53:31.026]  Great folks.
[02:53:31.986 --> 02:53:33.648]  And let's take a few calls.
[02:53:33.668 --> 02:53:35.149]  Let's talk to Kathy in Virginia.
[02:53:35.189 --> 02:53:35.809]  Thanks for holding.
[02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.970]  You're on the air, Kathy.
[02:53:37.291 --> 02:53:38.472]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:53:38.792 --> 02:53:40.834]  I have two quick questions and a quick comment.
[02:53:41.678 --> 02:53:43.459]  What kind of secret stuff is going on?
[02:53:43.499 --> 02:53:46.021]  What's going on at the School of the Americas in Georgia?
[02:53:46.101 --> 02:53:46.741]  What is that all about?
[02:53:46.781 --> 02:53:51.804]  They train Latin Americans with torture manuals, how to torture children in front of their parents.
[02:53:52.365 --> 02:53:59.929]  This is in the manuals, how to hook electrodes to them, how to kill people, how to execute people and cover it up, how to stage terror attacks.
[02:54:00.910 --> 02:54:02.471]  Basically, that's just one school.
[02:54:02.491 --> 02:54:06.814]  They have schools in Alabama and other areas where they train Arabs and mainly Al-Qaeda.
[02:54:07.194 --> 02:54:10.456]  And I have articles, AP, back in the late 90s with them, quote, training Al-Qaeda.
[02:54:11.217 --> 02:54:20.773]  Uh, so, uh, they have those facilities, too, and, uh, you know, they trained Saddam in 58 when he was 18 years old how to kill and assassinate and put him into power 20-something years later.
[02:54:21.494 --> 02:54:22.937]  And, uh, they just trained terrorists.
[02:54:23.627 --> 02:54:26.449]  And I want to clarify something that you've been saying.
[02:54:27.649 --> 02:54:38.756]  Satellite TV receiver boxes and HDTVs, do they have like listening devices or hidden cameras in there so that when you have them in your bedroom, they're able to watch you like through some kind of secret device?
[02:54:38.796 --> 02:54:40.217]  Yeah, well there's nothing secret about it yet.
[02:54:40.277 --> 02:54:41.697]  Digital cable does.
[02:54:41.917 --> 02:54:43.018]  Not all satellite does.
[02:54:43.038 --> 02:54:46.060]  There's some two-way satellite, but computers do it.
[02:54:47.486 --> 02:54:54.211]  And computers now come standard with cameras and microphones, and yeah, the government, whoever else wants to, dials in and watches you and listens to you with those.
[02:54:54.711 --> 02:55:10.681]  Okay, and just a quick comment, and that is, the listeners that are really, really mad at the government, I urge them to go to USAJOBS.gov and join the people that are trying to serve the public properly and honestly, and get a job and come to Washington, or look for a job in your local area.
[02:55:10.921 --> 02:55:11.982]  Join the federal workforce.
[02:55:12.757 --> 02:55:13.678]  Yeah, that is a way.
[02:55:13.738 --> 02:55:17.880]  I mean, because the government's gotten so corrupt that all the good people get out, we don't need that to happen.
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:19.241]  Yeah, don't drive us away.
[02:55:19.441 --> 02:55:20.201]  We're still trying.
[02:55:20.221 --> 02:55:21.262]  I hear you.
[02:55:21.482 --> 02:55:23.603]  I know everybody's not bad in the government, and God bless you.
[02:55:23.903 --> 02:55:24.924]  All right, we're almost out of time.
[02:55:24.964 --> 02:55:27.385]  Real fast, Rob in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[02:55:28.105 --> 02:55:29.466]  Yeah, Alex, thanks.
[02:55:29.586 --> 02:55:32.308]  I wanted to commend you for your body of work.
[02:55:32.868 --> 02:55:40.272]  I've looked at all your films and all of your other videos, and your passion just comes through just so strong.
[02:55:40.876 --> 02:55:41.436]  Well, thank you.
[02:55:41.756 --> 02:55:44.258]  I do not like what's happening, so there is passion.
[02:55:45.418 --> 02:55:54.742]  Well, the one thing I wanted to comment on was, it's just incredible the fact that there is so much corruption.
[02:55:55.542 --> 02:56:01.125]  There's not enough courts in this country to have all these people go on trial, all these corrupt politicians.
[02:56:01.705 --> 02:56:05.547]  The Department of Justice turns their back on known
[02:56:06.463 --> 02:56:08.685]  Profiteering from these defense contractors.
[02:56:08.705 --> 02:56:13.309]  There was a post up on, uh, I don't know where I saw it, Rents or, uh... Are you kidding?
[02:56:13.369 --> 02:56:18.232]  I mean, it's in the AP that Halliburton will get 20 million bucks for a $500 blue tarp.
[02:56:18.352 --> 02:56:20.975]  I mean, it's just... It's so... That's what I mean.
[02:56:21.015 --> 02:56:22.055]  It's just, it's off the chart.
[02:56:22.115 --> 02:56:22.876]  God bless you all.
