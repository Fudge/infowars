[00:00:05.752 --> 00:00:06.392]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.053 --> 00:00:08.113]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:09.954]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:11.395]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:13.056]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:17.538]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.898 --> 00:00:21.981]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:36.788]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome!
[00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.134]  It is the final day of the first month of 2007, the 31st day of January 2007.
[00:00:44.754 --> 00:00:46.836]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:46.876 --> 00:01:00.627]  He hasn't been doing a lot of radio interviews the last six months or so, since he was basically targeted at his university, Brigham Young, there in Salt Lake City, Utah.
[00:01:01.307 --> 00:01:03.529]  He is an award-winning physicist,
[00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:06.323]  Great family man and a wonderful patriot.
[00:01:06.743 --> 00:01:08.024]  I'm friends with he and his wife.
[00:01:08.584 --> 00:01:13.568]  Dr. Stephen E. Jones will be joining us in the second hour.
[00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:25.016]  And yes, health permitting, Aaron Russo, battling cancer for four plus years, just had surgery again last week.
[00:01:25.834 --> 00:01:35.417]  Will be joining us in the third hour to talk about Ron Paul's candidacy for president, the Federal Reserve, the IRS, the New World Order in general.
[00:01:37.958 --> 00:01:42.339]  So Stephen Jones in the second hour, Aaron Russo in the third hour.
[00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.700]  We will be taking calls throughout the broadcast today, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.402]  I've been promising to get into some detail about the whole global warming
[00:01:53.442 --> 00:02:19.902]  PR campaign that has reached just fever pitch is not the word crescendo is not the word because it's intensifying and I wanted to just walk through some of the examples every day I print 5, 6, 7, 10 articles where they're engaging in different public relations stunts and today I printed five different ones off and then driving in listening to Genesis Communications
[00:02:20.886 --> 00:02:43.611]  I heard Derrick Brownfield on the air reading a report from Judicial Watch that got the actual documents through a Freedom of Information Act request where they said, we'll use environmental governance and PR to claim the North American Union is about saving the environment.
[00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:49.553]  So they're saying they're using it as a fraud to sell the people.
[00:02:51.098 --> 00:02:53.300]  Literally wallowing in evidence of this.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.542]  So we'll be breaking that down.
[00:02:57.063 --> 00:03:02.007]  But first, when we return, I want to play a clip from Paula Zahn singing in last night.
[00:03:02.988 --> 00:03:07.491]  What I do is, I don't know why I'm going into this detail, but I kind of pull a double shift.
[00:03:07.852 --> 00:03:16.639]  I usually go home from about 5.30 to 8 and spend three hours or so with my children today.
[00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:17.920]  I'd like to spend all day with them.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.541]  And then when they go to sleep,
[00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.671]  I kissed my wife goodbye.
[00:03:22.592 --> 00:03:24.113]  Really, I've worked so hard.
[00:03:24.173 --> 00:03:25.895]  No time to really spend with her.
[00:03:26.756 --> 00:03:27.336]  It's crazy.
[00:03:27.356 --> 00:03:29.358]  You only live once, but we've got to save the country.
[00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:42.049]  And then I kissed her goodbye and I drive back up here to the office and work on the new film or take care of phone calls and work until usually about midnight or one in the morning.
[00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.391]  But I don't know why I'm telling that story.
[00:03:45.277 --> 00:03:47.439]  I'm just trying to get you to think about commitment.
[00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.681]  Think about the commitment I've made.
[00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:51.183]  You could make one-one-hundredth of that commitment.
[00:03:51.483 --> 00:03:52.765]  We'd probably save this country.
[00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:53.545]  I know a lot of you have.
[00:03:53.585 --> 00:03:56.228]  But Kevin Smith, the point is there's never really a rest.
[00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:57.269]  I'm glad Kevin called.
[00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:00.052]  He was at the office and he said, tune in to Paula Zahn right now.
[00:04:00.152 --> 00:04:00.772]  It was like 7.30.
[00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:07.078]  So we started recording at the house and my children got a rare view of television.
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.481]  Paula Zahn.
[00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.553]  And basically how if you think 9-11 is an inside job, you're an anti-Semite.
[00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:24.058]  So we're going to play that clip coming up in the next segment.
[00:04:24.838 --> 00:04:27.220]  And I'm going to comment on some different individuals.
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:36.005]  Then later, Keith Olbermann had a great fact check piece at the end of his show yesterday.
[00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:40.347]  His news program will play that as well.
[00:04:41.687 --> 00:04:46.688]  And as I mentioned, get into the whole global warming Kyoto propaganda.
[00:04:47.928 --> 00:04:51.189]  It's all coming up on the other side.
[00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.911]  Websites are JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:04.997]  It's here!
[00:05:05.217 --> 00:05:09.958]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.358 --> 00:05:18.020]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:25.741]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:33.003]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:37.542]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.883 --> 00:05:40.065]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to Terror Storm.
[00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:54.525]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:05:54.845 --> 00:05:57.627]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:05:57.908 --> 00:06:02.051]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:02.491 --> 00:06:03.312]  So what do you do?
[00:06:03.632 --> 00:06:08.196]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:08.676 --> 00:06:10.798]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:11.298 --> 00:06:25.987]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:26.047 --> 00:06:33.152]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:33.472 --> 00:06:36.614]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:06:38.295 --> 00:06:42.338]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:42.618 --> 00:06:45.360]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.582]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:51.624 --> 00:06:54.025]  Attention, attention everyone!
[00:06:54.125 --> 00:06:56.587]  A brand new invention just released.
[00:06:56.647 --> 00:07:01.350]  It's called Wrist Ease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[00:07:02.012 --> 00:07:08.816]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[00:07:09.356 --> 00:07:22.224]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:26.666]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[00:07:27.127 --> 00:07:31.089]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:37.195]  And Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[00:07:37.596 --> 00:07:40.599]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[00:07:40.979 --> 00:07:47.586]  That's Wristease, W-R-I-S-T-E-A-S-E, Wristease.com.
[00:07:47.746 --> 00:07:49.608]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.223]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:59.824 --> 00:08:02.866]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.591 --> 00:08:14.672]  Alright, second segment for those just joining us.
[00:08:14.712 --> 00:08:21.236]  We do have Aaron Russo battling cancer, joining us from his home in Los Angeles, California.
[00:08:22.196 --> 00:08:23.836]  And he's feeling up to it.
[00:08:24.116 --> 00:08:47.300]  He is scheduled for the third hour today again to talk about Ron Paul for president, his film America, Freedom to Fascism, and to take your phone call so you get a chance to talk to Aaron Russo, who we all hope and pray beats cancer, but it's just good to be able to get him on the show while we have him here with us.
[00:08:49.661 --> 00:08:50.781]  There's also a lot of
[00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:56.395]  Hyper propaganda going concerning global warming right now, climate change.
[00:08:57.936 --> 00:09:07.167]  Whether you believe in global warming or not, the point is the official solutions are not solutions, they're global taxes that have nothing to do with the real problems we face.
[00:09:07.207 --> 00:09:08.969]  So we're going to break that down.
[00:09:09.824 --> 00:09:17.888]  And we do have Professor Stephen A. Jones, who has been on a hiatus from talk radio for months and months, joining us in the second hour.
[00:09:18.408 --> 00:09:24.431]  Okay, let's go ahead and get into 9-11 first, though, before we run out of time in this hour, and we have guests joining us.
[00:09:27.592 --> 00:09:35.236]  Paula Zahn, the little propagandist, the trollop that gets up on television and spews her propaganda every night,
[00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:37.553]  I don't
[00:09:54.056 --> 00:09:56.078]  The question was, was it an inside job?
[00:09:56.098 --> 00:09:56.078]  36%.
[00:09:56.138 --> 00:10:02.083]  This is like eight months ago in a Scripps Howard Ohio University highly scientific poll.
[00:10:02.103 --> 00:10:04.645]  36% believe total inside job.
[00:10:06.246 --> 00:10:08.868]  68% believe they're being lied to and there's a cover-up.
[00:10:10.069 --> 00:10:11.931]  And then again we have Angus and Reed.
[00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:20.418]  Now, five months ago almost, an extremely scientific commission by ABC News and the Wall Street Journal. 84%
[00:10:24.005 --> 00:10:31.174]  of thousands sampled with a plus-or-minus rate of three plus-or-minus percentage points.
[00:10:31.194 --> 00:10:32.255]  So it could be 81.
[00:10:33.216 --> 00:10:35.118]  It could be as high as 87.
[00:10:35.158 --> 00:10:38.883]  I believe they're being lied to about 911.
[00:10:41.065 --> 00:10:42.667]  So Paul is on.
[00:10:43.108 --> 00:10:44.069]  It's over half
[00:10:45.692 --> 00:10:48.795]  If you average those numbers together, then no, it's an inside job.
[00:10:48.975 --> 00:10:54.280]  And a lot more than that, who know they're being lied to, are frankly just scared to tell a pollster on the telephone.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.681]  I've studied polling technology.
[00:10:56.262 --> 00:10:56.382]  It's 101.
[00:10:57.163 --> 00:11:04.750]  If you look into it, that a really controversial, scary question, people will tend to go with the less controversial answer.
[00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.194]  So if you're getting 36% saying total inside job, it is probably more like double that.
[00:11:09.694 --> 00:11:10.495]  And here's an example.
[00:11:10.595 --> 00:11:11.356]  Nielsen ratings.
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:30.665]  Nielsen, they have found, is not very accurate, and they hook a machine in to your television box, to your cable box, to your satellite, depending on which system you have, and they monitor what you watch, and the score is created out of that.
[00:11:32.637 --> 00:11:54.907]  But they have found that people tend to then have another television that they really watch the type of programming, you know, Sex and the City, or HBO, Real Sex, or whatever people are watching, they found that what's being watched on the Nielsen box isn't necessarily what's being, and it's the same thing with Arbitron Ratings and so many others.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:12:04.304]  That's why they found that computer cookies are so accurate and that's what industry is really switching over to is the last really six, seven years.
[00:12:05.364 --> 00:12:14.449]  They've had cookies longer but it's become predominant the last six, seven years is because that is showing exactly what you're really visiting and what you're really into.
[00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:25.355]  An example of this is when you go to Amazon.com and you've ordered there before and you'll notice that let's say you bought a romance novel and then it'll show you on the main page just for you.
[00:12:26.391 --> 00:12:27.072]  We're good to go.
[00:12:51.696 --> 00:12:52.817]  Let's just be clear about this.
[00:12:52.857 --> 00:12:55.438]  I've interviewed Christopher Bolin several times years ago.
[00:12:55.959 --> 00:12:58.720]  I think he's done good reporting on the past on a host of issues.
[00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:08.826]  We defended him when he was brutalized, clearly targeted by the government in the mafia city of Chicago.
[00:13:08.846 --> 00:13:20.873]  And of course I was thanked for that by his cohorts who, I don't think Chris is bad, I think he doesn't know who he runs with to the incredible line.
[00:13:23.705 --> 00:13:25.546]  As bad as it gets, slander.
[00:13:26.206 --> 00:13:29.148]  I mean, things I won't even repeat here on air, just off the charts.
[00:13:30.589 --> 00:13:35.972]  And still, though, I will tell you that Chris is, I think, a genuine person.
[00:13:35.992 --> 00:13:41.155]  And all he's saying is that Israel clearly was in a support role of 9-11.
[00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:45.317]  And on the show, on the program,
[00:13:46.491 --> 00:13:47.251]  That you're about to hear.
[00:13:47.291 --> 00:13:51.953]  I'm going to write notes while it plays, and have time to do it last night, and then I'll comment on it after, and let you comment on it after.
[00:13:53.934 --> 00:14:06.879]  They also have, you know, American Jews, who I really feel sorry for, you know, one of them whose son died, saying, show me the facts, show me where Jews got warnings, show me, and you know, my son died, how dare you?
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:09.340]  And indeed, Jews did die.
[00:14:10.781 --> 00:14:13.682]  But where does that story come from, that Jews were told to get out of the building?
[00:14:14.362 --> 00:14:15.963]  It comes from Haratz.
[00:14:16.673 --> 00:14:18.355]  It comes from Jerusalem Post.
[00:14:18.955 --> 00:14:20.657]  It comes from Newsweek.
[00:14:22.358 --> 00:14:34.308]  Four hours before the attacks, the Instant Message Company, based in Tel Aviv, next door to Shin Bet, Israeli Internal Intelligence, literally next door, and its U.S.
[00:14:34.388 --> 00:14:39.913]  base was in the World Trade Center towers, they had thousands of employees,
[00:14:41.275 --> 00:14:50.100]  They admit, and it shows they weren't part of it, because when they got asked about it, they said, yes, we got a warning to get out of the building.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:56.203]  We IM'd and called all of our employees and told them, get out of the building, don't go to work.
[00:14:56.303 --> 00:14:59.105]  If you're there, get out, because they're 24 hours a day operations.
[00:15:00.205 --> 00:15:01.406]  And they said, if you're there, get out.
[00:15:01.546 --> 00:15:03.227]  If you're going in, don't go.
[00:15:04.702 --> 00:15:12.969]  Now clearly, and of course people pick apart and lie about what I say, I just said Israel clearly is involved in certain aspects of the attack.
[00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:23.418]  What I'm saying is, Odigo, the instant message company, now under a new name, it's been bought, did on record, that's where that story mainly came from.
[00:15:24.139 --> 00:15:26.020]  did go public and say we were warned.
[00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:35.506]  If they were part of it, they wouldn't have said, their CEO wouldn't have said, yeah, it's weird, we got told here in Israel to get our people out.
[00:15:37.587 --> 00:15:45.252]  See, that's all I'm saying is that they wouldn't have gone public and admitted that if they were part of it.
[00:15:45.332 --> 00:15:49.455]  Clearly someone in Israel who had knowledge or was involved did warn them.
[00:15:50.776 --> 00:15:52.777]  But you also have Arabs
[00:15:53.971 --> 00:16:08.799]  Pointing up by name school children saying those towers won't be there next week and you clearly had the buildings at half capacity that normally there were double the amount of people in that building when at that time in the morning when it got hit.
[00:16:09.787 --> 00:16:13.029]  Cops were on record saying they were told don't go in.
[00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:26.059]  Port Authority workers, other people, a whole bunch of CEOs that were based in the building had been told to have a special meeting with Warren Buffett at Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska.
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:33.945]  And indeed they were there and Bush strangely flew in for a secret meeting with over 130 top CEOs.
[00:16:35.446 --> 00:16:38.128]  Something like 40 of them would have been in the towers that day.
[00:16:38.188 --> 00:16:39.229]  I mean this is bizarre.
[00:16:40.527 --> 00:16:44.410]  So, this is a very, very important story.
[00:16:46.812 --> 00:16:52.297]  Because you do have dancing Israelis jumping up and down on top of the building videotaping what happened.
[00:16:52.397 --> 00:16:56.140]  I've interviewed the sheriff of Bergen County
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:02.621]  I have talked to him.
[00:17:02.641 --> 00:17:06.423]  I had him on about his cold microchip, the entire population.
[00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:09.365]  I was pushing Verichip, but I brought that up while he was on.
[00:17:09.645 --> 00:17:14.268]  Frankly, I got him on for one reason, and then I really was... told him another.
[00:17:14.928 --> 00:17:18.050]  But it was honest, because I did want to talk about the microchips, too.
[00:17:19.331 --> 00:17:20.592]  So we've been covering this.
[00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:26.456]  We've been covering this since day one, and I've been attacked by the ADL on their website for it.
[00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:35.091]  I am not going to sit here and say that Israel ran the entire attacks.
[00:17:36.311 --> 00:17:37.512]  Now let's be clear about this.
[00:17:38.812 --> 00:17:51.275]  It's like if three people robbed a bank, and one guy was black from say Angola, another guy was white from Germany, and another guy was Jewish from Israel.
[00:17:52.495 --> 00:17:55.356]  Now, I'm going after everybody involved.
[00:17:55.556 --> 00:17:57.136]  I want to bust all three of them.
[00:17:57.981 --> 00:18:11.376]  But the way the COINTELPRO operatives work and the way they work is, no, you've got to say it's just the Vatican, you've got to say it's just the Jews, you've got to say it's just Dick Cheney, or it's just Bush, or it's just the Pentagon, or it's the Russians, or it's the whatever.
[00:18:12.745 --> 00:18:13.785]  Clearly, U.S.
[00:18:13.845 --> 00:18:22.907]  intelligence, private corporations, British and Israelis, from the evidence, including the Bush family, and Cheney, were all involved.
[00:18:22.947 --> 00:18:35.129]  This was a concerted effort at black-op levels, in compartmentalized sectors, and if you study anything about intelligence operations, you'll learn that Western intelligence, basically at the top, is the same people.
[00:18:36.589 --> 00:18:40.090]  So I'm just simply saying there wasn't one Jewish bank robber.
[00:18:40.876 --> 00:19:02.229]  There were other people involved and clearly Israelis were involved and had a lot to gain to get the war on terror going and get the Iraq war going and Benjamin Netanyahu is running around saying we're going to get nuked, give up all of your rights, Newt Gingrich is saying it simultaneously, there's going to be attacks and I have no doubt
[00:19:03.078 --> 00:19:11.504]  I mean, British intelligence has been caught staging terror, the Israelis are constantly getting caught doing it, our government is constantly getting caught doing it, clearly they're all involved.
[00:19:11.544 --> 00:19:15.247]  So we're here, as we've always said, saying that there's involvement.
[00:19:16.668 --> 00:19:27.036]  But, it is wildly unpopular, and it's not the truth, to say that just Israel did this, and people instinctively know that Israel couldn't make NORAD stand down and
[00:19:28.363 --> 00:19:32.105]  CIA insider trading and mashing tens of thousands of U.S.
[00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:34.086]  troops to invade Afghanistan in the months before.
[00:19:34.566 --> 00:19:35.226]  People know that.
[00:19:35.767 --> 00:19:40.349]  And so people say, it's not Cheney, it's not Bush, it's the Jews!
[00:19:41.529 --> 00:19:47.092]  When they do that, it's not true, and it damages this movement, and demonizes us.
[00:19:47.412 --> 00:19:49.713]  And that's why CNN has them on.
[00:19:50.374 --> 00:19:51.254]  Stay with us, we'll play it.

[00:21:37.774 --> 00:21:40.976]  Ted Anderson for Midas, January 31st, 2007.
[00:21:41.357 --> 00:21:41.437]  Gold 652.
[00:21:41.697 --> 00:21:45.900]  Ounce gold coins are at 673.20, 339.15 for half, 169.58 for quarter.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.541]  Ounce coins at 673.20, 339.15, and 169.58.
[00:22:07.294 --> 00:22:09.155]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[00:22:09.215 --> 00:22:10.055]  Fiat currency.
[00:22:10.396 --> 00:22:14.637]  1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[00:22:14.958 --> 00:22:17.899]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[00:22:17.919 --> 00:22:21.380]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[00:22:21.541 --> 00:22:24.182]  1998, gold jumps 2 thirds over the Russian ruble.
[00:22:24.382 --> 00:22:27.723]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[00:22:27.803 --> 00:22:32.465]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[00:22:32.625 --> 00:22:33.906]  Could government let this happen?
[00:22:34.026 --> 00:22:35.987]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[00:22:36.247 --> 00:22:43.250]  Midas has Nick Bereshov's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[00:22:43.270 --> 00:22:45.010]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[00:22:45.071 --> 00:22:46.191]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:46.531]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.952 --> 00:22:55.454]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:56.015 --> 00:23:04.081]  Did you know the syndicated columnist Charlie Reese once wrote a stinging indictment against the internationalists who have captured our federal government for their own purposes?
[00:23:04.881 --> 00:23:09.865]  He reported that the present government of the United States is systematically undoing our independence.
[00:23:10.592 --> 00:23:18.042]  He said that agreeing to belong to the World Trade Organization and taking orders from it was a deliberate sacrifice of our national sovereignty.
[00:23:18.863 --> 00:23:22.608]  He said the United Nations represents the same threat to our sovereignty.
[00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:26.814]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass.
[00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:32.058]  And offer you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:32.618 --> 00:23:34.199]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:34.259 --> 00:23:34.599]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:34.659 --> 00:23:35.019]  Call now.
[00:23:35.039 --> 00:23:36.680]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:17.356 --> 00:24:19.177]  I'll tell you what I like about the piece, though.
[00:24:20.338 --> 00:24:22.639]  All four of the people on the show are, like, panicked.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:26.541]  They know that people aren't buying their lies anymore.
[00:24:27.822 --> 00:24:41.390]  And so they're trying to wed the view that Israel did this all on its own to the rest of the 9-11 Truth Movement so they can desperately then claim that anybody that does it is anti-Semitic.
[00:24:42.452 --> 00:24:45.494]  The Christopher Lin did a pretty good job of not being roped in by him.
[00:24:45.994 --> 00:24:49.877]  That's why they probably only used 30 seconds of him in like an 8 minute piece.
[00:24:49.937 --> 00:24:52.739]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:58.743]  So, let's go ahead and play part of this, and we'll come back and comment on that, and then we'll play the rest of it.
[00:24:58.763 --> 00:25:00.804]  It's about 7 minutes long, 8 minutes long.
[00:25:01.464 --> 00:25:03.946]  Here it is, CNN Paula's on, last night.
[00:25:03.986 --> 00:25:05.067]  Listen to all the buzzwords.
[00:25:06.363 --> 00:25:11.306]  We have all heard some absolutely incredible 9-11 conspiracy theories.
[00:25:11.366 --> 00:25:12.746]  The web, of course, is full of them.
[00:25:12.786 --> 00:25:17.949]  But tonight, we're bringing one out that feeds on racism out in the open.
[00:25:18.009 --> 00:25:30.656]  We were absolutely shocked by one recent poll that found out that one in every three Americans believe the terror attacks were not the work of America's enemies, but some sort of inside job.
[00:25:31.176 --> 00:25:37.878]  And Deborah Farrakh found a smaller percentage who believe in even uglier theories.
[00:25:38.698 --> 00:25:41.819]  This 9-11 attack was not by 19 Arabs.
[00:25:41.879 --> 00:25:43.199]  It was not by Muslims.
[00:25:43.599 --> 00:25:45.640]  They talk about a Jewish plot.
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.500]  Everywhere you look, you find a Zionist agent.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.022]  A conspiracy by Israeli intelligence.
[00:25:53.422 --> 00:25:56.102]  Or by Zionist moles in the Bush administration.
[00:25:56.122 --> 00:25:58.643]  Allegedly calling the shots in the Middle East.
[00:25:59.369 --> 00:26:04.050]  Websites, magazines, documentaries, radio programs.
[00:26:04.311 --> 00:26:08.912]  Dozens of them disputing the fact that Al-Qaeda was behind the 9-11 attacks.
[00:26:09.132 --> 00:26:11.653]  It was done by a group of Zionists.
[00:26:12.093 --> 00:26:15.314]  Are you suggesting that Al-Qaeda had nothing to do with it?
[00:26:15.514 --> 00:26:20.855]  That this was all part of a large conspiracy, Zionist or otherwise?
[00:26:21.216 --> 00:26:25.957]  Al-Qaeda is, in my opinion, has been exploited.
[00:26:27.327 --> 00:26:30.211]  I question whether such a group even exists.
[00:26:30.832 --> 00:26:35.220]  Chicago writer Christopher Boleyn is one of the conspiracy theorists.
[00:26:35.801 --> 00:26:40.449]  I believe that there are Israeli elements that are connected to Mossad.
[00:26:41.502 --> 00:26:42.722]  that are involved in this attack.
[00:26:43.262 --> 00:26:47.623]  There's no physical evidence to support claims that Jews were behind 9-11.
[00:26:48.203 --> 00:26:57.605]  But the speculation and rumors, mostly discounted here in the U.S., have gained momentum in Muslim countries, where they're discussed and believed.
[00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:03.326]  Deborah Lauder is with the Jewish-run Anti-Defamation League.
[00:27:03.546 --> 00:27:10.047]  What's most troubling is when it reaches the Internet and goes into the Muslim Arab world, we have this cross-fertilization of hate.
[00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:12.269]  And this is something we've never seen before.
[00:27:12.709 --> 00:27:16.432]  A whole web of beliefs has grown to support this conspiracy theory.
[00:27:16.852 --> 00:27:20.355]  Listen to these Americans interviewed on Iranian television.
[00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:25.039]  This is a big plot to take control of us, to start war.
[00:27:25.539 --> 00:27:32.365]  One of the beliefs is that some 4,000 Israelis or Jews in the New York City area were warned by instant messages.
[00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:34.747]  Not to go to work on 9-11.
[00:27:35.147 --> 00:27:40.891]  For Wilton Sexor, a retired police sergeant who is Jewish, the claim is outrageous.
[00:27:40.911 --> 00:27:47.136]  The remains consisted of a piece of bone, two and a half inches long and about an inch long.
[00:27:47.476 --> 00:27:49.117]  About the size of your index finger.
[00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:50.238]  And that's all they ever found?
[00:27:50.258 --> 00:27:50.999]  That's all they ever found.
[00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:53.861]  Sexor's son Jason died in the towers.
[00:27:54.441 --> 00:27:56.623]  He says Jason received no warning.
[00:27:57.302 --> 00:28:00.547]  Neither did some 400 Jews who died in the tragedy.
[00:28:00.908 --> 00:28:04.112]  Give me the names of the 4,000 Jews who stayed home.
[00:28:04.573 --> 00:28:06.156]  Show me something.
[00:28:06.897 --> 00:28:08.219]  There is nothing to show.
[00:28:09.033 --> 00:28:15.916]  This is a total, ridiculous, asinine rumor that was started by anti-Semites.
[00:28:16.296 --> 00:28:21.058]  I think that conspiracy theories in general really do work a bit like a game of telephone.
[00:28:21.638 --> 00:28:26.980]  You know, they are told and retold and tend to get more and more far out in the telling.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.381]  When you imply that somehow
[00:28:30.442 --> 00:28:34.526]  Israelis were involved in the attack on the World Trade Center in the Pentagon.
[00:28:35.247 --> 00:28:40.212]  People are going to look at you, critics will say, you are an anti-Semite, are you?
[00:28:40.593 --> 00:28:42.275]  No, I'm not an anti-Semite.
[00:28:43.356 --> 00:28:52.706]  This is the main charge that's leveled against me and has been for years, even before 9-11, because I am a critic
[00:28:53.394 --> 00:28:54.534]  of Zionist policies.
[00:28:55.054 --> 00:28:57.855]  That's a very common technique among anti-Semites.
[00:28:58.035 --> 00:28:59.515]  They will twist things.
[00:28:59.715 --> 00:29:00.796]  I'm not an anti-Semite.
[00:29:00.836 --> 00:29:13.859]  I just believe X, Y, Z. Anti-Semitic or not, the question now, will this 9-11 conspiracy theory become like the Kennedy assassination, analyzed for generations as an unsolved mystery?
[00:29:14.479 --> 00:29:16.979]  Debra Fairich, CNN, New York.
[00:29:17.079 --> 00:29:17.459]  All right.
[00:29:18.259 --> 00:29:20.360]  That's the first part, and then Paula Zahn
[00:29:21.698 --> 00:29:23.779]  And her minions come back and start babbling.
[00:29:24.639 --> 00:29:28.221]  So we'll analyze Part 1 for a few minutes when we get back, then I'll play Part 2.
[00:29:29.622 --> 00:29:30.282]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:30.302 --> 00:29:31.102]  Stay with us.
[00:29:42.468 --> 00:29:43.388]  We're on the march.
[00:29:43.868 --> 00:29:45.469]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:46.390 --> 00:29:49.091]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:56.270]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.

[00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:11.618]  Let me tell you something about the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company.

[00:30:52.816 --> 00:30:53.376]  Hi, Michelle.
[00:30:53.416 --> 00:30:54.777]  I haven't seen you on the bus for a while.
[00:30:55.077 --> 00:30:56.117]  Did they change your shift?
[00:30:56.277 --> 00:30:56.757]  No, Lori.
[00:30:56.777 --> 00:30:58.297]  I finally quit my job.
[00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:00.738]  I'm working at home now, and I love it.
[00:31:01.138 --> 00:31:02.038]  No more commuting.
[00:31:02.498 --> 00:31:04.719]  And I'm home when the kids get out of school.
[00:31:04.879 --> 00:31:05.739]  Working at home?
[00:31:06.159 --> 00:31:06.760]  Doing what?
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:07.980]  It's a long story.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.401]  It all started when I discovered the website EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[00:31:11.641 --> 00:31:13.961]  Oh, Michelle.
[00:31:14.021 --> 00:31:16.702]  You didn't fall for one of those internet deals, did you?
[00:31:16.922 --> 00:31:19.863]  Well, I looked into several, and this one is for real.
[00:31:20.203 --> 00:31:21.103]  Are you sure?
[00:31:21.123 --> 00:31:26.406]  I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[00:31:26.646 --> 00:31:26.986]  Really?
[00:31:27.186 --> 00:31:30.748]  I've joined the Success Team and their major advertising co-op.
[00:31:31.008 --> 00:31:35.450]  Our business is fully automated, which gives me more money and the time to enjoy it.
[00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:37.811]  I'll be earning money while we're skiing this winter.
[00:31:37.971 --> 00:31:39.132]  What was that website again?
[00:31:39.292 --> 00:31:41.933]  Earnmoneyathome123.com.
[00:31:42.013 --> 00:31:43.034]  Here, write it down.
[00:31:43.114 --> 00:31:43.594]  Good idea!
[00:31:44.085 --> 00:31:46.267]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[00:31:46.547 --> 00:31:48.308]  Maybe we can go skiing this winter, too.
[00:31:48.568 --> 00:31:51.530]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com is a global opportunity.
[00:31:52.331 --> 00:31:58.355]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:31:58.375 --> 00:32:00.557]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for
[00:32:06.869 --> 00:32:08.410]  Globalism is nationalism.
[00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.792]  Start reading The Nationalist Times each month.
[00:32:11.032 --> 00:32:16.436]  The Nationalist Times promotes a common sense, intelligent, and passionate alternative to the reigning party line.
[00:32:16.736 --> 00:32:25.423]  Published monthly since 1985, The Nationalist Times is a 20-page newspaper featuring outstanding writers and columnists who don't believe in taboos or sacred cows.
[00:32:25.723 --> 00:32:26.023]  I think so.
[00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.991]  Welcome back!
[00:33:03.432 --> 00:33:05.573]  Glad you joined us.
[00:33:08.094 --> 00:33:12.316]  Okay, let's just go through some notes I just wrote on part one of that.
[00:33:14.337 --> 00:33:20.439]  There's a rumor that instant messages were seen and were sent to Jews.
[00:33:21.980 --> 00:33:26.302]  Well, Odigo was an Israeli company and most of their employees were Jewish, but
[00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:32.923]  If you actually read the article, they warned all the employees, whether you were a European or African or Semitic.
[00:33:34.824 --> 00:33:37.165]  And they did give them a warning.
[00:33:38.085 --> 00:33:43.948]  And I think CNN went a little too far thinking people are so stupid, they're not going to do a Google search.
[00:33:44.008 --> 00:33:52.092]  And by the way, it's in my film Road to Tyranny, it's in Masters of Terror, it's in Marshall Law.
[00:33:52.912 --> 00:33:54.653]  You see, I made the first film on 9-11.
[00:33:56.115 --> 00:34:03.580]  Early 2002, and I've made the most films on the subject of any filmmaker, and I put it in there day one.
[00:34:05.542 --> 00:34:07.743]  So, it's all right there.
[00:34:09.485 --> 00:34:22.534]  Odigo, the instant messaging company, did contact its employees from Tel Aviv, transatlantically, to New York City, the Dutch founded city.
[00:34:23.832 --> 00:34:25.933]  And that is the bottom line.
[00:34:26.253 --> 00:34:28.635]  So that's why you're losing all your viewers.
[00:34:28.715 --> 00:34:30.015]  That's why you're discredited.
[00:34:30.396 --> 00:34:34.058]  Because people now are checking into what you have to say.
[00:34:36.299 --> 00:34:37.760]  And I agree with Christopher Bolin.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.460]  That's exactly what I've always said.
[00:34:39.621 --> 00:34:45.884]  Criminal elements associated with Mossad clearly were involved in some type of roles in the attacks.
[00:34:47.088 --> 00:34:58.031]  The art students, the jumping up and down, Israeli shadowing the supposed Al-Qaeda operatives from San Diego to Miami to Maine.
[00:35:00.431 --> 00:35:02.472]  Clearly there's some involvement here.
[00:35:03.972 --> 00:35:14.875]  But I don't want to partition the guilt through some vitriolic Jew-hating, and there are a lot of people who just hate Jews, and they want it to all be about Israel.
[00:35:14.915 --> 00:35:15.355]  If somebody
[00:35:16.056 --> 00:35:19.238]  Slips on a banana peel, a Jew must have done it.
[00:35:21.379 --> 00:35:23.740]  At a certain point, it really gets ridiculous.
[00:35:25.661 --> 00:35:28.262]  Notice CNN is putting this on Paula Zahn's program.
[00:35:28.382 --> 00:35:30.823]  Notice they're giving this massive coverage.
[00:35:31.483 --> 00:35:44.930]  And almost every program they do about 9-11 is either space beams, lasers, pods, no planes hitting the World Trade Centers, which is ridiculous, or
[00:35:46.477 --> 00:35:46.997]  Jews!
[00:35:48.258 --> 00:35:51.160]  That way the general public hears it and it's discredited.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.381]  But I'll tell you, the mainstream media is so discredited, this isn't even going to work.
[00:35:55.862 --> 00:35:58.864]  People are more sophisticated than that.
[00:36:00.065 --> 00:36:02.726]  I have a lot of fans at CNN in the bowels of it.
[00:36:02.766 --> 00:36:04.007]  People that actually work there.
[00:36:06.768 --> 00:36:08.329]  I've had a lot of discussions with them.
[00:36:08.949 --> 00:36:09.270]  A.J.
[00:36:09.330 --> 00:36:13.552]  Hammer was a former talk show host from New York.
[00:36:14.508 --> 00:36:16.410]  And I didn't know him, but I knew some of the producers.
[00:36:17.170 --> 00:36:18.512]  They know me, I talked to them.
[00:36:19.833 --> 00:36:23.636]  And they got top ratings off having me on, but it was the showbiz show.
[00:36:25.258 --> 00:36:30.763]  And there were higher-ups in CNN that thought because it was Charlie Sheen that it would just discredit 9-11.
[00:36:30.803 --> 00:36:39.711]  But as soon as it backfired and those polls came out with 83% on CNN, that same number keeps coming up in the mid-80s, mid to low 80s.
[00:36:41.713 --> 00:36:45.836]  And they said, yeah, we're going to have you on every day now for the next week and all these others on.
[00:36:45.856 --> 00:36:49.038]  But then they tried to get Chairman Keene on, who canceled.
[00:36:50.659 --> 00:36:59.024]  And then I talked to some of the producers and they said, oh my gosh, we were told that it isn't even about viewers, that you're not to go back on and this story is dead.
[00:37:00.986 --> 00:37:07.730]  And then I'd been contacted by some of the producers for Anderson Cooper and Paula Zahn.
[00:37:09.778 --> 00:37:11.539]  Going, oh man, we know it's an inside job.
[00:37:11.619 --> 00:37:12.139]  Absolutely.
[00:37:12.179 --> 00:37:12.979]  Listen, I listened to the show.
[00:37:12.999 --> 00:37:13.920]  I heard that guest the other day.
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.420]  Listen, I'm trying to get you on.
[00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.241]  I think we're going to get you on.
[00:37:17.321 --> 00:37:18.982]  Oh man, the higher-ups called.
[00:37:19.022 --> 00:37:19.822]  You're not coming on.
[00:37:19.842 --> 00:37:32.408]  Because they don't want me on talking about CIA insider trading and Building 7 not being hit by a plane coming down and Operation Northwoods, the official government plan to carry out attacks very similar to 9-11.
[00:37:32.848 --> 00:37:36.249]  They don't want me on talking about how the hijackers were trained covertly at U.S.
[00:37:36.289 --> 00:37:37.610]  military bases with the evidence.
[00:37:39.432 --> 00:37:42.653]  Or how the Israelis were shadowing them, obviously protecting them.
[00:37:42.693 --> 00:37:47.494]  They don't want real, hardcore, meat and potatoes, verified stuff.
[00:37:48.214 --> 00:37:59.097]  They want either highly insinuary, polarizing issues, to where even if you think 9-11 is an inside job, if it gets anti-semitism attached to it, a lot of people will shut up.
[00:38:00.297 --> 00:38:05.638]  Or if ridiculous, you know, directed energy weapons, space beams, gets integrated with it.
[00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:08.259]  It is a poison pill.
[00:38:09.395 --> 00:38:12.077]  And it's done by design.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:15.920]  By a lot of people.
[00:38:16.161 --> 00:38:19.684]  And I'm not saying Mr. Bolin because what he said was true.
[00:38:20.544 --> 00:38:21.945]  And he's done real reporting.
[00:38:23.146 --> 00:38:26.729]  And I've interviewed him, I don't know, four or five times many years ago.
[00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:38.299]  But as soon as people drift into the clutches of people that are either completely psychopathic or agents out of the pit of hell, you've got to disassociate.
[00:38:40.396 --> 00:38:42.757]  People that say unspeakable things about my family.
[00:38:43.797 --> 00:38:44.457]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:38:44.497 --> 00:38:44.877]  You look.
[00:38:44.917 --> 00:38:52.119]  As soon as people do that, I am loved because people know my track record and folks then basically blow their own feet off.
[00:38:52.919 --> 00:38:57.160]  Which is sad because I would like to see more people in the fight.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.321]  As I say, I believe a rising tide lifts all ships.
[00:39:03.281 --> 00:39:05.582]  So, I mean, there's so many other notes here.
[00:39:06.664 --> 00:39:10.707]  The, you know, an even uglier theory is that the Jews did it.
[00:39:13.068 --> 00:39:20.012]  And for those that are exposing the Israeli involvement, it isn't the Jews, it is criminal intelligence networks.
[00:39:20.052 --> 00:39:33.480]  You know, when I get up here and, like we did yesterday in a tale that British intelligence clearly carried out the 7-7 bombings with witnesses, and we go over all of it, and give you exclusives, does BBC come on and go,
[00:39:36.588 --> 00:39:37.369]  Angloism!
[00:39:38.830 --> 00:39:39.891]  Anti-Anglican!
[00:39:41.232 --> 00:39:43.874]  Well, no, they don't do that there because it'd be too ridiculous.
[00:39:46.076 --> 00:39:50.859]  We haven't had this built-in guilt put into us about criticizing Anglo-Saxons.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:40:01.868]  But I remember when everybody was criticizing the 3,000, now it's 6,000 plus, front companies in the late 1990s and communist spies and generals in the Commerce Department.
[00:40:03.138 --> 00:40:08.821]  In secret document rooms, running fax machines back to Beijing, and the murder of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.
[00:40:10.101 --> 00:40:12.622]  They said, on the CNN, is it racism?
[00:40:12.762 --> 00:40:13.663]  Anti-Asian?
[00:40:14.043 --> 00:40:14.383]  No!
[00:40:14.423 --> 00:40:16.344]  We don't like spies in our country!
[00:40:16.864 --> 00:40:18.585]  We don't like a President selling us out!
[00:40:22.207 --> 00:40:29.450]  Or, when I get up here and criticize Putin for clearly staging bombing attacks in his own country in 1999 to become popular as Vice President, to then be elected,
[00:40:30.183 --> 00:40:37.287]  The Volante Award against Chechnya, and we don't get calls or TV programs going, it's anti-Russian, anti-Slav.
[00:40:38.828 --> 00:40:41.330]  We're simply going where the facts take us.
[00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:59.380]  So, I get to have the peanut gallery of toothless white supremacists screaming for my blood, because I don't say that, you know, when there's a volcanic eruption, Jews caused it, or when you wreck your car, Jews caused it, or when you get a cold, Jews caused it, or when you don't have, you know, just all of this stuff, Jews caused it.
[00:41:00.313 --> 00:41:08.535]  And then I also get to have the ADL and the intelligence report put out every quarter by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:41:08.635 --> 00:41:10.995]  I get to have them lie about me and twist things.
[00:41:11.395 --> 00:41:12.096]  I'm sick of it!
[00:41:12.416 --> 00:41:15.396]  I'm just here covering the news and the facts.
[00:41:16.416 --> 00:41:19.637]  Trying to bring people together against the New World Order.
[00:41:21.718 --> 00:41:23.278]  That's what I've always attempted to do.
[00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:30.521]  And it's just so destructive, the space beams and the no-planes and the Jews did it all.
[00:41:30.942 --> 00:41:32.764]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:41:33.084 --> 00:41:37.408]  Here's part two of the piece from Paula Zahn as we analyze this propaganda.
[00:41:38.209 --> 00:41:40.652]  With our out-in-the-open panel, sure they have plenty to say about this.
[00:41:40.772 --> 00:41:42.894]  Lauren, Michael DeRoy, welcome back.
[00:41:43.707 --> 00:41:47.673]  Alright, so let's start with the resident Jew on our panel here.
[00:41:47.753 --> 00:41:52.319]  I mean, you hear this stuff and it just makes you sick to your stomach.
[00:41:52.359 --> 00:41:57.886]  There is absolutely no evidence that anybody other than Al-Qaeda was involved with this attack.
[00:41:58.387 --> 00:41:59.729]  How upsetting is this to you?
[00:42:00.888 --> 00:42:03.712]  Look, we've been kicked around for 2,000 years.
[00:42:03.792 --> 00:42:07.436]  The face you're looking at's got a lot of anger in it because of that.
[00:42:08.197 --> 00:42:09.198]  That's not a way to live.
[00:42:09.298 --> 00:42:12.162]  Wandering around the globe, never having a home.
[00:42:12.422 --> 00:42:16.247]  It's pretty difficult because every time there's trouble, we're scapegoated.
[00:42:16.267 --> 00:42:20.252]  We're not the only ones that are scapegoated, but we're scapegoated by people who are frightened.
[00:42:20.732 --> 00:42:21.673]  They don't care.
[00:42:21.893 --> 00:42:22.933]  They are paranoid.
[00:42:23.234 --> 00:42:25.255]  You cannot debunk this theory.
[00:42:25.535 --> 00:42:31.998]  It is madness as well as idiocy to think that the Jews brought down the World Trade Center on 9-11.
[00:42:32.339 --> 00:42:36.281]  But you cannot argue logic to someone who is mentally ill.
[00:42:36.801 --> 00:43:01.805]  What frightens me is that the whole nation is frightened, and that fear is being fueled by this administration, and by the media, not you, just the opposite, I congratulate you, and I'm grateful for it, seriously, to bring this stuff out, because it is in those times that Jews, like other minorities, better get scared, better get angry, better fight for what's right, and try and convince people
[00:43:02.592 --> 00:43:07.333]  Courage is the cure for paranoia, not racism.
[00:43:07.933 --> 00:43:12.594]  Is this just a smear campaign for anti-Semites?
[00:43:12.654 --> 00:43:13.834]  I think it's... I agree with Michael.
[00:43:13.874 --> 00:43:17.195]  I mean, the blame the Jews theme is something that goes back about 2,000 years.
[00:43:17.215 --> 00:43:18.675]  I mean, it's a really hearty varietal.
[00:43:19.055 --> 00:43:22.136]  But look, I mean, we know who pulled off 9-1-1.
[00:43:22.476 --> 00:43:24.696]  Richard Minner writes about it in his book, Disinformation.
[00:43:25.016 --> 00:43:27.997]  He quotes directly from Osama bin Laden, who says,
[00:43:28.397 --> 00:43:33.522]  On a tape we found, we calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy who would be killed based on the position of the tower.
[00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:37.586]  We had notifications since the previous Thursday that the event would take place that day.
[00:43:37.827 --> 00:43:38.267]  Unquote.
[00:43:38.287 --> 00:43:40.209]  Says Osama Bin Laden himself.
[00:43:40.289 --> 00:43:42.351]  But I think that Bin Laden is still here.
[00:43:42.371 --> 00:43:43.152]  Bin Laden is country.
[00:43:43.192 --> 00:43:43.512]  We know now.
[00:43:43.532 --> 00:43:47.516]  But my point is that we have a government that has led us into a war.
[00:43:47.817 --> 00:43:49.939]  And most Americans, even the smart of us,
[00:43:50.519 --> 00:43:51.160]  Smartest of us.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:54.542]  Sit around and go, now why again are we here in the war?
[00:43:54.722 --> 00:44:03.109]  And when there are blanks, we often fill in the blanks and those blanks are filled in by misinformation, urban legends, we create stories and people believe things.
[00:44:03.129 --> 00:44:04.850]  You're talking about a very unpopular war.
[00:44:04.890 --> 00:44:05.771]  We're talking about 9-11.
[00:44:07.052 --> 00:44:11.597]  No, but what I'm talking about is the war is based upon what our government told us, this fear that we have from 9-11.
[00:44:11.637 --> 00:44:15.282]  This will get worse as the unrest in the Middle East gets worse.
[00:44:15.602 --> 00:44:17.124]  This problem will not go away.
[00:44:17.484 --> 00:44:24.092]  And the reason it won't go away is because we don't have an administration as we once did that said and counseled us
[00:44:24.452 --> 00:44:27.073]  We have nothing to fear, but fear itself.
[00:44:27.353 --> 00:44:28.653]  We have just the opposite.
[00:44:28.953 --> 00:44:42.776]  We have an administration that fuels fear, that puts up the sign every day, that tells us, be frightened, stay scared, be worried, and so we are suspicious, we are xenophobic, and we don't like anybody that's different from us.
[00:44:42.816 --> 00:44:48.938]  How concerned are you that these conspiracy theories will take even deeper hold?
[00:44:49.358 --> 00:44:55.741]  Look, I think it's entirely possible the kind of people who are spreading this sort of stuff will continue to blame the Jews for anything that can go wrong.
[00:44:56.061 --> 00:45:08.287]  I think it's very important, as this war on terror continues, to point out exactly who the bad guys are, which are Islamofascists who want you, you, you, and me dead, and want people dead around the country, and they're engaged in tremendous violence, killing thousands of people all around the world.
[00:45:08.607 --> 00:45:12.668]  Starting with, well even before 9-1-1, the 93 attack, the attack on the USS Cole.
[00:45:12.708 --> 00:45:15.188]  This is a really serious enemy we need to identify.
[00:45:15.208 --> 00:45:19.169]  Yes it is, but there are reasons why people are open to belief theories.
[00:45:19.189 --> 00:45:19.769]  That's my point.
[00:45:19.809 --> 00:45:30.211]  There are reasons why people are open to belief theories and these reasons will not change unless our government more actively works to inform us of what the real truth is so people are not here playing guessing games.
[00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:33.532]  Lauren Lake, Michael Gross, DeRoy Murdoch, fascinating discussion.
[00:45:33.812 --> 00:45:34.172]  Thank you.
[00:45:35.553 --> 00:45:39.697]  Your anger was palpable during that piece as well.
[00:45:39.777 --> 00:45:40.478]  Well understood.
[00:45:40.979 --> 00:45:42.900]  Larry King Live's coming up in just a few minutes.
[00:45:43.181 --> 00:45:45.783]  Hey Larry, you're going to talk to the owners of Barbaro tonight?
[00:45:46.444 --> 00:45:48.526]  Yeah, well, who wouldn't be angry with that list?
[00:45:48.606 --> 00:45:49.527]  I know, I know.
[00:45:49.807 --> 00:45:50.968]  But you know, it's astonishing.
[00:45:51.008 --> 00:45:58.856]  Wasn't it a statistic that one in three Americans believe not that particular conspiracy theory, but one of many?
[00:45:59.626 --> 00:46:03.828]  The old Goebbels theory, you can tell a lie long enough, more people will believe it.
[00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.551]  Ah yes, tell a lie enough, more people will believe it.
[00:46:09.531 --> 00:46:23.419]  Like, there's no proof that there were instant messages sent when it was in Newsweek, Associated Press, Haraj, Jerusalem Post, and a bunch of other publications where the CEO of the company going, yeah, we got a warning to get our people out.
[00:46:24.619 --> 00:46:27.621]  That's where that comes from, from the company,
[00:46:29.474 --> 00:46:31.054]  That's where it comes from, Larry!
[00:46:32.215 --> 00:46:33.755]  The old Goebbels Theory.
[00:46:34.175 --> 00:46:35.716]  Tell a lie often enough.
[00:46:36.456 --> 00:46:37.376]  The Big Lie Theory.
[00:46:38.497 --> 00:46:39.077]  Amazing.
[00:46:39.117 --> 00:46:40.677]  Yeah, your Big Lie Theory.
[00:46:42.078 --> 00:46:51.340]  And notice that one fellow on the show holds up some book that, oh, we founded tape, the military founded tape of Bin Laden taking credit.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.701]  Kind of like the fat Bin Laden tape whose nose grew an inch.
[00:46:55.081 --> 00:46:55.902]  He gained over 150 pounds.
[00:46:57.654 --> 00:47:02.057]  You could do a face scan and tell it wasn't him, but they tried to blur it so you couldn't get a good face scan.
[00:47:02.458 --> 00:47:06.981]  So, three different universities in the U.S., Canada, and France did voice prints.
[00:47:07.061 --> 00:47:15.848]  Again, they took real admitted Bin Laden tapes, television tapes, from the past, from the mid-90s, and they took those and they made a voice print of it.
[00:47:16.468 --> 00:47:15.848]  100%.
[00:47:16.488 --> 00:47:18.630]  Then they ran the other one through, didn't match.
[00:47:19.231 --> 00:47:21.372]  Then they had linguists listen, didn't match.
[00:47:22.393 --> 00:47:23.234]  It's not Bin Laden.
[00:47:23.334 --> 00:47:23.734]  It's fake.
[00:47:24.355 --> 00:47:25.536]  Remember the White House memo?
[00:47:25.936 --> 00:47:27.517]  Plans to plant WMDs.
[00:47:27.597 --> 00:47:28.997]  Plans to stage their discovery.
[00:47:29.317 --> 00:47:31.278]  Plans to have defectors come out and say they saw them.
[00:47:32.119 --> 00:47:33.399]  Lying to us.
[00:47:33.739 --> 00:47:34.560]  So that's a lie.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:45.685]  Also, it's CNN actually pushing this, hoping, because in major polls it's about 7% of the population, and that's quite a bit, now believes Israel carried out the attacks.
[00:47:46.986 --> 00:47:49.547]  Of the 36% that believe it's a total inside job.
[00:47:49.987 --> 00:47:51.848]  Of the 84% that believe they're being lied to.
[00:47:53.095 --> 00:47:59.982]  And so they're really hoping to push this so this becomes the dominant idea that if you talk about it you're just an anti-Semite.
[00:48:00.523 --> 00:48:01.684]  So it's very sophisticated.
[00:48:02.084 --> 00:48:07.730]  And notice they keep equating, it was four times in that talk, 9-11 inside job equals racism.
[00:48:08.383 --> 00:48:09.164]  Equals pogroms.
[00:48:09.304 --> 00:48:10.104]  Equals racism.
[00:48:10.364 --> 00:48:17.889]  We played the leftists out at the Capitol Saturday at an anti-war march going, the problem is the Bilderbergs.
[00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:20.030]  It's these 9-11 truth people.
[00:48:20.091 --> 00:48:20.911]  It's racism.
[00:48:20.951 --> 00:48:21.171]  See?
[00:48:21.692 --> 00:48:24.553]  And the guy goes, in the speech he goes, you know, I'm screwing this up.
[00:48:24.593 --> 00:48:25.434]  I'm reading this wrong.
[00:48:26.014 --> 00:48:26.975]  Somebody else had written it.
[00:48:29.496 --> 00:48:33.899]  So we've got the talking point now where you go, hey, Building 7 had bombs in it and it doesn't fit with mathematics.
[00:48:34.279 --> 00:48:34.400]  Oh!
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:36.441]  Oh, you're a racist, huh?
[00:48:37.576 --> 00:48:39.576]  Oh, we see what you're doing.
[00:48:39.596 --> 00:48:42.717]  In fact, can you dig that up, that minute and a half clip we played yesterday, John?
[00:48:44.538 --> 00:48:45.838]  Where he's out there at UT.
[00:48:46.298 --> 00:48:48.718]  By the way, I was invited to speak at that, and I said, OK, I'll come speak.
[00:48:48.738 --> 00:48:53.939]  And I told my producer, I said, watch, I'll be canceled because they'll say I'm a racist.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:01.161]  And sure enough, they sent us an email saying that, that we were canceled because 9-11 Truth and all of us are, it's really racism.
[00:49:01.201 --> 00:49:01.341]  See?
[00:49:02.102 --> 00:49:05.066]  See, I mean, this is a PR talking point.
[00:49:05.567 --> 00:49:08.852]  And here is some well-meaning dupe reading it.
[00:49:09.032 --> 00:49:09.412]  Here it is.
[00:49:11.155 --> 00:49:17.965]  I come today to talk to you about the plague of racist violence that currently afflicts the world today.
[00:49:19.259 --> 00:49:30.950]  And I want you all to ask yourselves for a minute, how is it possible that 2% of the world's population controls more wealth than 60% of the world's population?
[00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:39.517]  How is it possible that this group, outnumbered by hundreds to one, can maintain this system?
[00:49:39.958 --> 00:49:43.221]  Well, the answer is right in front of our faces.
[00:49:45.023 --> 00:50:04.876]  There are those who would tell us that it is because there are masons hiding in our closets, and Bilderbergers hiding under our beds, and there are vast conspiracies to concoct attacks like 9-11 to increase the grip of power that the ruling class has on our world.
[00:50:04.916 --> 00:50:07.878]  But in fact, it's right in front of your face.
[00:50:08.598 --> 00:50:10.880]  The problem is, is racism.
[00:50:11.824 --> 00:50:13.385]  And what is racism exactly?
[00:50:15.827 --> 00:50:19.869]  I'm going to be referring to my notes a lot because I didn't memorize this.
[00:50:22.371 --> 00:50:33.397]  Okay, well first of all, the ruling class needs racism to create fear and mistrust between people of different races just as they use homophobia and sexism.
[00:50:33.417 --> 00:50:33.898]  Okay.
[00:50:34.958 --> 00:50:36.379]  So that's what they're doing right there.
[00:50:36.459 --> 00:50:37.280]  They're promoting it.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.001]  They're bringing the term out and attaching it.
[00:50:41.388 --> 00:50:42.408]  There's no ruling elite.
[00:50:42.528 --> 00:50:45.309]  The problem's the ruling elite.
[00:50:45.329 --> 00:50:45.689]  9-11 truth.
[00:50:45.949 --> 00:50:46.509]  Racism!
[00:50:46.789 --> 00:50:47.309]  Racism!
[00:50:47.489 --> 00:50:48.049]  Racism!
[00:50:48.789 --> 00:50:49.309]  Racism!
[00:50:49.690 --> 00:50:50.210]  Racism!
[00:50:55.471 --> 00:50:55.991]  It's here.
[00:50:56.171 --> 00:51:00.912]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:01.312 --> 00:51:08.913]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:09.662 --> 00:51:16.707]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:28.534]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:28.854 --> 00:51:32.337]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:32.817 --> 00:51:34.738]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:35.078 --> 00:51:38.921]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:02.162 --> 00:52:04.643]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:05.043 --> 00:52:19.607]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:19.647 --> 00:52:19.947]  government.
[00:52:20.127 --> 00:52:21.908]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.

[00:52:28.371 --> 00:52:32.852]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:53:56.267 --> 00:53:57.808]  This show is documented.

[00:54:10.334 --> 00:54:12.775]  Bunch of big updates on 9-11 and the movement itself.
[00:54:13.459 --> 00:54:14.560]  That is coming up.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:21.246]  We've got Aaron Russo joining us in the third hour now, battling cancer, talking about Ron Paul's run for president, and to take your phone calls.
[00:54:21.846 --> 00:54:23.027]  I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[00:54:23.047 --> 00:54:24.108]  I've made 15 films.
[00:54:24.148 --> 00:54:36.579]  My latest documentary is Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror from what happened with Hitler right through our government staging terror attacks, Gulf of Tonkin, what happened in Iran through 9-11, 7-7, we go to England, and so much more.
[00:54:40.213 --> 00:54:42.295]  68 minutes of extras on the film.
[00:54:43.095 --> 00:54:47.419]  If you haven't gotten Terror Storm, you need to purchase it via Infowars.com.

[00:56:09.654 --> 00:56:09.874]  How are you?
[00:56:37.009 --> 00:56:41.113]  I got you on the air here in Pensacola area back in 1999.
[00:56:41.733 --> 00:56:42.974]  We had a good six-year run.
[00:56:43.114 --> 00:56:45.016]  They changed their programming and dropped you.
[00:56:45.176 --> 00:56:51.401]  I am trying now to get you on another stronger AM station close to Pensacola.
[00:56:52.509 --> 00:56:54.351]  And I haven't had much success yet.
[00:56:54.692 --> 00:56:58.056]  Well, you know, we're getting about four affiliates a week lately.
[00:56:58.897 --> 00:57:04.603]  And, I mean, Emma's Communications has put me on stations like KLBJ, 590 in Austin, award winning.
[00:57:05.164 --> 00:57:10.591]  We just went on the big Emma station that's up in Norfolk, Virginia, that covers four states.
[00:57:12.321 --> 00:57:14.562]  When I say Clear Channel, I don't mean it's owned by Clear Channel.
[00:57:14.782 --> 00:57:19.083]  The term Clear Channel means, you know, day and night, 50,000 watts, blasting out.
[00:57:19.863 --> 00:57:28.465]  And, uh, you know, a bunch of other, just, uh, Jacksonville, there's a station around the Georgia-Florida border that covers Jacksonville and, like, three other big towns.
[00:57:28.845 --> 00:57:33.586]  I need, in fact, I need to get all those call letters and start plugging them, because we got them last week, and even more are coming in.
[00:57:33.626 --> 00:57:35.647]  So, it's you, the listeners, that make it happen.
[00:57:35.687 --> 00:57:36.047]  Thank you.
[00:57:36.627 --> 00:57:38.667]  That's what I wanted the listeners to understand.
[00:57:38.688 --> 00:57:40.468]  Now, I'm calling about Terror Storm Alex.
[00:57:41.067 --> 00:57:44.548]  I ordered it a few months back and I've been having some trouble getting it.
[00:57:44.988 --> 00:57:50.750]  I sent you an email last week and a follow-up snail mail this week that should arrive.
[00:57:50.890 --> 00:58:03.315]  We are now shipping the day after we get it, but we had about two months ago a computer crash and it totally fried everything and it caused for like three weeks.
[00:58:04.575 --> 00:58:06.416]  And then we just played tag and all this.
[00:58:06.436 --> 00:58:08.396]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to give you the back line.
[00:58:09.217 --> 00:58:10.377]  In fact, I'm going to do this.
[00:58:11.317 --> 00:58:12.918]  Because we get like one of these calls a week.
[00:58:13.078 --> 00:58:14.018]  There's like 50 people.
[00:58:14.038 --> 00:58:15.379]  We just can't seem, we're just juggling.
[00:58:15.399 --> 00:58:21.021]  And it just keeps, and I'm going to give you a back number right now, sir, and we're going to get that to you right now.
[00:58:21.381 --> 00:58:24.842]  We just lost like, I don't know, what's a week of orders?
[00:58:24.902 --> 00:58:26.943]  It was like a couple hundred.
[00:58:27.343 --> 00:58:28.484]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:29.004]  Stay with us.
[00:58:32.145 --> 00:58:36.727]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:48.035 --> 00:58:48.675]  Big Brother.
[00:58:49.336 --> 00:58:50.376]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:51.097 --> 00:58:52.198]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:52.878 --> 00:58:53.678]  You want answers?
[00:58:54.439 --> 00:58:55.419]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.662]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:00.182 --> 00:59:02.524]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:04.261]  Alex Jones.
[00:59:04.281 --> 00:59:07.203]  Alright, we're now into the second hour.
[00:59:26.684 --> 00:59:37.030]  We've got Dr. Steven Jones coming up in just about eight minutes to join us with some big new developments on 9-11 Truth and talk about the movement itself and what our main goal should be in his opinion, which I respect.
[00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:39.391]  We've got Aaron Russo joining us in the hour after that.
[00:59:39.411 --> 00:59:41.812]  I've got a bunch of other audio clips, tons of news.
[00:59:41.872 --> 00:59:43.813]  I want to expose global warming as a fraud.
[00:59:43.833 --> 00:59:47.736]  A lot more coming up later in this hour.
[00:59:48.216 --> 00:59:52.378]  Right now, let's go to Linda in Rhode Island.
[00:59:52.478 --> 00:59:53.179]  You're on the air.
[00:59:53.219 --> 00:59:53.879]  Thanks for holding.
[00:59:55.976 --> 00:59:56.876]  They've got their radio up.
[00:59:56.896 --> 00:59:58.056]  Let's put them on hold.
[00:59:58.096 --> 00:59:59.357]  We'll go back to them later.
[00:59:59.737 --> 01:00:02.837]  Brian, where are you calling from?
[01:00:03.237 --> 01:00:04.478]  I'm calling from Indiana, Alex.
[01:00:04.538 --> 01:00:04.878]  Welcome.
[01:00:04.898 --> 01:00:05.438]  You're on the air.
[01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:06.298]  Alright.
[01:00:06.338 --> 01:00:07.618]  First time, long time, Alex.
[01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:09.819]  I wanted to get your take on a couple of things.
[01:00:09.859 --> 01:00:13.760]  Here in Indiana, we've got, of course, a real globalist for Governor Mitch Daniels.
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.240]  He's selling off our highways and all our infrastructure.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:22.901]  They've got the Indiana Commerce Connector coming through and people are upset about that.
[01:00:22.941 --> 01:00:23.842]  I'm trying to wake them up.
[01:00:23.902 --> 01:00:25.562]  That's part of the North American Union, we know.
[01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:28.366]  We've got this other thing people here are upset about.
[01:00:28.406 --> 01:00:30.649]  It's called the Rockies Express Pipeline.
[01:00:30.689 --> 01:00:34.394]  It's a 42-inch natural gas pipeline.
[01:00:34.534 --> 01:00:39.881]  It goes from the Rocky Mountain region of Wyoming to the eastern edge of Ohio.
[01:00:39.941 --> 01:00:42.103]  I just wanted to get your take on what that is.
[01:00:42.144 --> 01:00:43.145]  Is that another part
[01:00:43.792 --> 01:00:46.933]  of the North American Union being implemented, or what is that really?
[01:00:47.474 --> 01:00:54.817]  You know, I vaguely read about that, so I can't speak with any expertise, or I'm not really informed on it, so I can't really comment.
[01:00:55.397 --> 01:01:09.123]  But, when people hear that the main I-35 Trans-Nav-to-Highway, and that's only one of 83, it's just the first big one there, the other ones are just taking over existing interstate highways,
[01:01:09.969 --> 01:01:15.735]  People hear it's 10 miles wide, or they're going to grab land on 5 miles, and in some cases 10 miles on each side.
[01:01:16.175 --> 01:01:17.877]  They say, well, what's going to be there?
[01:01:18.317 --> 01:01:34.012]  There's going to be power lines, there's going to be oil lines, gas pipelines, trains, international zone, basically, with different countries running different legs of the zones inside each other's nations.
[01:01:34.804 --> 01:01:37.707]  Okay, so that's what they're doing.
[01:01:37.767 --> 01:01:44.133]  It's part of integrating our infrastructure, integrating our economies, integrating our laws, integrating everything.
[01:01:44.233 --> 01:01:53.881]  Energy, that's, you know, we've now through FOIA requests gotten documents out of the North American Summit they had last year in Canada in secret, and they're in there.
[01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.723]  I have it from Judicial Watch.
[01:01:55.783 --> 01:01:57.825]  This is their internal documents.
[01:01:58.526 --> 01:02:01.068]  The whole meeting was about how the main focus was
[01:02:02.586 --> 01:02:05.631]  Number one, how to keep it secret from the American, Canadian, and Mexican people.
[01:02:06.052 --> 01:02:07.494]  It's if they're talking about how to lie.
[01:02:08.195 --> 01:02:12.582]  Then they talk about how to use people's concern about the environment to push it and global warming.
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:18.885]  And then they talk about how to integrate everything, and it was mainly big CEOs there deciding how to then push it.
[01:02:19.306 --> 01:02:34.019]  And that's why you then hear the Weather Channel and CNN, and they're going to turn the Eiffel Tower off to make everybody think there's no power, and all these symbols, and you know, big PR campaigns when Prince Charles won't fly on a jet because, you know, just one time, of course.
[01:02:34.340 --> 01:02:35.961]  Just to, oh, see, there's no energy.
[01:02:36.301 --> 01:02:38.884]  It's getting you ready to, quote, sacrifice
[01:02:39.264 --> 01:02:40.425]  through global taxation.
[01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:45.689]  They talk about a well-head oil tax, an energy tax in the US, Canada, and Mexico.
[01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:48.892]  Just basically taxes for the world government.
[01:02:49.545 --> 01:02:55.727]  Another thing about our Governor Mitch Daniels, he's also pushing real hard for all-day kindergarten.
[01:02:55.787 --> 01:03:01.730]  Is that just another example of them wanting to indoctrinate the children at a younger age for a longer period of time?
[01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:08.452]  Yes, the feds for 20 years have been saying they want children in government care from age 2 to 18.
[01:03:08.552 --> 01:03:15.335]  Now they want the schools to go until 8 o'clock at night, so lazy parents can go to the bar instead of spending even a couple hours with their children.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.600]  Yes, exactly.
[01:03:21.841 --> 01:03:22.341]  Good points.
[01:03:22.361 --> 01:03:23.342]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:24.022 --> 01:03:24.603]  Absolutely.
[01:03:24.643 --> 01:03:30.227]  Dr. Steven Jones coming up and we'll go to Linda, Steve, Chris, and many others.
[01:03:30.888 --> 01:03:33.109]  On the other side, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.231]  It's already Wednesday, the 31st of January, 2007.
[01:03:46.869 --> 01:03:47.289]  It's here!
[01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:52.273]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:52.653 --> 01:04:00.319]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:00.999 --> 01:04:08.045]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:15.330]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spies,
[01:04:15.805 --> 01:04:19.847]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:20.167 --> 01:04:23.828]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:24.128 --> 01:04:26.009]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:26.389 --> 01:04:30.311]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:37.515 --> 01:05:38.679]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:43.217 --> 01:05:47.779]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:51.121]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:05:51.441 --> 01:05:54.003]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:05:54.363 --> 01:05:59.185]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:05:59.565 --> 01:06:04.948]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:06:05.248 --> 01:06:09.550]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act, which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:06:11.051 --> 01:06:15.713]  Many people believe, parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:06:16.033 --> 01:06:22.296]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the beast, take notice.
[01:06:22.656 --> 01:06:24.276]  It says, worship the beast.
[01:06:24.557 --> 01:06:27.178]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:06:27.438 --> 01:06:32.660]  For a better understanding of this very important topic, and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.000]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[01:06:39.288 --> 01:06:44.913]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:58.284 --> 01:07:01.126]  What are the goals of the 9-11 truth community?
[01:07:01.386 --> 01:07:03.208]  An article written back in December by Stephen E. Jones.
[01:07:03.228 --> 01:07:04.729]  We're going to be discussing that.
[01:07:06.232 --> 01:07:20.556]  We're also going to talk about some of the new research he's been doing concerning the controlled demolitions of the North and South Tower and the 47-story skyscraper, Building 7, hundreds and hundreds of yards away that collapsed perfectly, not even really damaging buildings, 25 feet away from it.
[01:07:21.556 --> 01:07:29.358]  And again, other people have savaged Dr. Jones with no evidence or facts.
[01:07:29.818 --> 01:07:31.218]  It's all very suspect.
[01:07:32.639 --> 01:07:34.319]  I mean, you would think a child
[01:07:36.365 --> 01:07:40.449]  You would think a child would know that particle beams didn't blow up the towers.
[01:07:40.489 --> 01:07:43.872]  You would think a child would know that was classic controlled demolition of Building 7.
[01:07:44.953 --> 01:07:50.798]  You would know that a, you know, a child would know that thousands of witnesses saw aircraft and aircraft did indeed hit the towers.
[01:07:51.602 --> 01:07:53.103]  This is all by design, folks.
[01:07:53.123 --> 01:07:54.083]  This is not by mistake.
[01:07:54.343 --> 01:07:55.843]  We're not going to get off into all that today.
[01:07:55.863 --> 01:08:03.546]  We're talking about the real science that Dr. Jones has brought forward and others have brought forward, and that's what makes the establishment so upset.
[01:08:03.606 --> 01:08:11.749]  And how do we keep this movement based in science and facts and reality so that we can win the fight and the battle for this republic?
[01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:14.990]  Thanks for coming on, Mr. Jones.
[01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:17.631]  Well, I'm glad to be here with you again, Alex.
[01:08:19.253 --> 01:08:20.354]  You can just call me Steve.
[01:08:21.475 --> 01:08:23.376]  Well, I know we're friends, but I do respect you.
[01:08:23.956 --> 01:08:25.577]  You know, a lot has happened.
[01:08:26.398 --> 01:08:27.779]  First off, how's the family doing?
[01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:29.360]  The family's doing well.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.540]  I appreciate that.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:32.942]  Yeah, we're doing just fine.
[01:08:33.002 --> 01:08:39.346]  You know, we feel along those lines that we've been pretty blessed over the last several years.
[01:08:39.426 --> 01:08:48.112]  We've had real estate opportunities come along, and so we did invest in some real estate, and now with this
[01:08:49.085 --> 01:08:49.926]  Early Retirement.
[01:09:07.239 --> 01:09:07.759]  Well, I have a Ph.D.
[01:09:07.799 --> 01:09:09.080]  in Physics from Vanderbilt University.
[01:09:37.406 --> 01:09:50.272]  I spent quite a bit of time at Stanford University at the Linear Accelerator Center, where I did my research, and then postdoctoral work at Cornell University and Los Alamos National Laboratory.
[01:09:51.553 --> 01:09:59.537]  And then I've taught in the University of Idaho system, as well as Brigham Young University.
[01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:06.340]  And my 9-11 research began just about two years ago now.
[01:10:07.216 --> 01:10:12.040]  You know, I've had various nudges, Alex, from people to look at this.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:16.704]  And when I first looked at the collapse of Building 7, I was pretty well hooked.
[01:10:17.484 --> 01:10:26.792]  You know, you look at that and you say, as you mentioned earlier in the program, it just looks so much like controlled demolition.
[01:10:26.812 --> 01:10:31.916]  We've all seen buildings brought down by explosives, and this looks just like that, top down.
[01:10:32.156 --> 01:10:36.680]  And I grabbed my stopwatch and timed the fall.
[01:10:37.259 --> 01:10:49.689]  of the building and calculated how long it should take for an object dropped off the roof to fall, which is six seconds and the fall of the corner of the roof as it begins to steady decline, six and a half seconds.
[01:10:50.209 --> 01:11:03.599]  Then I was timing control demolitions and they also are about at about freefall speed because you see you move the material out of the way using explosives so that the roof then can fall at nearly freefall speed.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:05.981]  So it all hung together as
[01:11:07.128 --> 01:11:08.009]  Control Demolition
[01:11:18.939 --> 01:11:19.339]  That's right.
[01:11:39.182 --> 01:11:39.602]  Excellent.
[01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:43.085]  Because I'd like to go through the basic science.
[01:11:43.125 --> 01:11:53.594]  These are actual laws that have been demonstrated literally millions, if not billions of times in industry alone.
[01:11:54.035 --> 01:12:02.402]  We know that steel, if it's non-structural, the most base type, that barely registers on the scale as being steel, 2,700
[01:12:05.566 --> 01:12:09.072]  74 degrees, the strongest structural steel at around 3300, correct?
[01:12:10.842 --> 01:12:13.203]  Yeah, to melt steel is right.
[01:12:13.223 --> 01:12:16.864]  It's right around 2,800 Fahrenheit, 1,500 centigrade.
[01:12:17.224 --> 01:12:23.965]  Yeah, so how does 1,800 degree jet fuel, and that's with oxygen added, it wasn't burning that hot, do that?
[01:12:24.546 --> 01:12:28.967]  Here's the firefighters talking about the molten foundry.
[01:12:29.007 --> 01:12:29.387]  Here it is.
[01:12:30.007 --> 01:12:32.828]  You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel.
[01:12:33.528 --> 01:12:35.528]  Molten steel running down the channel rails.
[01:12:35.948 --> 01:12:36.989]  Like you're in a foundry.
[01:12:38.974 --> 01:12:39.555]  I don't know.
[01:12:52.109 --> 01:12:53.530]  We're good to go!
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:21.785]  Shattered perfectly, and then we have the video and photos of them shaved off with even melted edges around them.
[01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:25.487]  Boy, how does jet fuel do that, Doctor?
[01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:27.729]  Well, it doesn't.
[01:13:27.849 --> 01:13:30.231]  That's the point, of course, Alex.
[01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:35.354]  I go into this in my paper, which is at journalof911studies.com.
[01:13:35.715 --> 01:13:36.555]  Now it's available.
[01:13:36.575 --> 01:13:44.381]  It's also published in David Ray Griffin's book, The 9-11 American Empire, Intellectuals Speak Out, Volume 1.
[01:13:45.299 --> 01:14:02.892]  And so yeah exactly this molten metal that comes out is very clearly orange in color and there's a lot of it and as you quoted I love that clip I have put that in my paper here recently so people can find it there as well to click on it.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:10.422]  But yeah, many observers reported seeing this molten metal in the rubble underneath the towers.
[01:14:10.442 --> 01:14:12.843]  But what do firefighters know about fire?
[01:14:14.764 --> 01:14:15.604]  Quite a lot, I hope.
[01:14:16.805 --> 01:14:19.706]  Yeah, and they weren't, you know, they weren't terribly concerned.
[01:14:19.726 --> 01:14:31.510]  Those firefighters going into the buildings weren't worried that they were just going to totally collapse because a total collapse had never happened before due to fire or damage, you know, and so they were in there.
[01:14:32.202 --> 01:14:39.185]  And a great surprise, of course, when one of these steel frame skyscrapers came down for the first time due to fire.
[01:14:40.045 --> 01:14:47.369]  And then you have Building 7, seven hours after the towers came down, and it comes down, straight down, and very rapidly.
[01:14:47.429 --> 01:14:59.814]  I mean, it's just, as you look at this, and that's what I find, Alex, as I talk to other scientists, if I can just get them to read my paper, to look at the data, they have a completely different attitude about these
[01:15:00.649 --> 01:15:05.132]  Questions and the need for an in-depth investigation of 9-11.
[01:15:05.553 --> 01:15:09.135]  Not like the 9-11 omission.
[01:15:09.456 --> 01:15:12.358]  Okay, it's commission, but mostly omission.
[01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:17.421]  I mean, look, the 9-11 commission report doesn't even mention the collapse of Building 7.
[01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:19.643]  What an omission.
[01:15:20.023 --> 01:15:21.064]  It's just remarkable.
[01:15:21.304 --> 01:15:26.128]  Anyways, I get scientists to look at the data, and they're much more sympathetic to the
[01:15:26.843 --> 01:15:30.806]  to the call for further studies and further investigation.
[01:15:57.583 --> 01:16:07.889]  I mean, for those that aren't scientists, or those that aren't firefighters, or those that aren't engineers, can you explain to them how 1800 degrees doesn't turn steel into molten slag?
[01:16:07.909 --> 01:16:10.851]  Yeah, it obviously doesn't.
[01:16:11.191 --> 01:16:14.093]  And yes, I talked to scientists.
[01:16:14.293 --> 01:16:23.338]  You know, for instance, I had a reaction of a professor here at the University, and he
[01:16:23.877 --> 01:16:27.500]  His gut reaction, his initial reaction was, well, this is crazy.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:32.124]  I mean, how could you possibly think that this could be an inside job?
[01:16:32.144 --> 01:16:36.107]  And I said, well, look, read my paper and then get back to me.
[01:16:36.447 --> 01:16:44.293]  You know, I mean, that's why we, as scientists, write papers is so people can look at the data themselves, sort it out, think about it.
[01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:46.715]  I said, so do, you know, act like a scientist here.
[01:16:47.116 --> 01:16:48.597]  Read my paper and respond.
[01:16:49.097 --> 01:16:49.718]  So he did.
[01:16:50.378 --> 01:16:52.380]  And his attitude changed completely.
[01:16:53.035 --> 01:16:53.595]  I was just like a 180.
[01:16:53.855 --> 01:16:58.356]  And in particular about Building 7, he said I cannot explain it.
[01:17:00.957 --> 01:17:02.397]  It needs further investigation.
[01:17:03.698 --> 01:17:09.579]  But now they've tried to treat you like Galileo saying the world is round and try to send you to Siberia, but that's not working.
[01:17:10.479 --> 01:17:17.401]  Well, it is cold here actually, but not Siberia, Alex.
[01:17:17.881 --> 01:17:22.422]  I feel like the retirement was probably the best thing to do.
[01:17:23.152 --> 01:17:26.853]  I mean it was offered to me and I realize they're under some pressure.
[01:17:26.873 --> 01:17:32.115]  It's pretty obvious as you read the newspaper articles what was happening last fall.
[01:17:33.356 --> 01:17:42.379]  And so it just seemed better for me and this way I can devote full time and I can speak out freely and teach people what I'm learning.
[01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:43.603]  And so on.
[01:17:43.763 --> 01:17:45.524]  So I think it's worked out pretty well.
[01:17:45.564 --> 01:18:01.111]  Well, there's been attempts to bias people in our supposed own movement to debunk what you've said and then just more evidence comes out reaffirming and reconfirming and testing what you've said and you've only been proven right over and over again and they've been made to look like complete clowns.
[01:18:02.111 --> 01:18:03.932]  And I know you're a gentleman and don't like to talk about that.
[01:18:03.972 --> 01:18:07.553]  Neither do I. It's just it's it's so it's so it's so transparent.
[01:18:07.794 --> 01:18:08.894]  This is not by accident.
[01:18:09.834 --> 01:18:10.815]  Well, you know,
[01:18:12.063 --> 01:18:20.946]  As scientists again, and I appreciate your, keep coming, we keep coming back to this, we use the scientific method, we can sort out the wheat from the chaff.
[01:18:21.866 --> 01:18:27.587]  And these ideas that space, or beams, ray beams from space knock down the towers.
[01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:32.949]  Well, and the idea that there are no commercial, no real commercial deaths.
[01:18:33.089 --> 01:18:34.149]  Stay there, we've got a break.
[01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:37.030]  Finish on the other side, then we'll get into the goals of this movement.
[01:18:39.304 --> 01:18:44.385]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:18:44.445 --> 01:18:51.746]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:18:51.906 --> 01:19:02.528]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:19:02.748 --> 01:19:07.289]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:19:07.569 --> 01:19:12.552]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[01:19:12.773 --> 01:19:15.715]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:15.935 --> 01:19:25.801]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.

[01:19:37.369 --> 01:19:37.789]  I think so.
[01:19:54.342 --> 01:19:56.184]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[01:19:56.264 --> 01:19:57.105]  Fiat currency.
[01:19:57.845 --> 01:20:01.989]  1920s, the German mark explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:20:02.009 --> 01:20:03.850]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:20:04.931 --> 01:20:08.414]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:20:08.574 --> 01:20:11.196]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:20:11.416 --> 01:20:14.139]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:20:14.379 --> 01:20:19.523]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:20:19.663 --> 01:20:20.944]  Could government let this happen?
[01:20:21.084 --> 01:20:23.006]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:20:23.266 --> 01:20:30.276]  Midas has Nick Bereshov's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:20:30.316 --> 01:20:32.058]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:20:32.098 --> 01:20:33.280]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:33.580]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.056 --> 01:20:47.688]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[01:20:48.509 --> 01:20:53.455]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[01:20:54.176 --> 01:21:00.164]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and in World War I and World War II?
[01:21:00.884 --> 01:21:09.314]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.

[01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:42.824]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:42.844 --> 01:22:46.705]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:48.746 --> 01:22:52.947]  Tomorrow evening, 7.30 to 10 p.m.
[01:22:53.467 --> 01:22:55.108]  at the UT Union Ballroom.
[01:22:55.148 --> 01:22:59.889]  Beautiful building right there beneath the big tower and the fountains.
[01:23:00.969 --> 01:23:02.410]  It holds a thousand people.
[01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:05.390]  I just started promoting it Monday, so we'll probably have about 500.
[01:23:06.091 --> 01:23:06.931]  Please come.
[01:23:06.951 --> 01:23:12.012]  We're going to have Georgetown Priest, former city council member, expert on 9-11, speaking about 9-11 and the war.
[01:23:12.032 --> 01:23:13.133]  We're going to have Jack Blood there.
[01:23:13.153 --> 01:23:14.553]  They're both going to give 30-minute speeches.
[01:23:15.482 --> 01:23:19.325]  And then I'm going to speak for an hour.
[01:23:20.826 --> 01:23:26.551]  And then for 45 minutes or so, I'm going to get all three of us up there on stage and take your questions.
[01:23:27.212 --> 01:23:28.913]  So that is the roster.
[01:23:29.293 --> 01:23:30.694]  Hope to see you there tomorrow night.
[01:23:31.535 --> 01:23:35.618]  Going back to Professor Stephen Jones, Doctor Stephen Jones, Physicist Stephen Jones.
[01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:42.744]  Steve, continuing was a few points you wanted to finish up about the space beam people and the no-plane people.
[01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:44.746]  Pretty transparent what that's all about.
[01:23:45.266 --> 01:23:46.847]  There has been a lot of talk lately about ideas that
[01:24:13.789 --> 01:24:22.436]  Well, they function to distract, and actually, as you mentioned, discredit much of the basic strong material that we have that challenges the official story of 9-11.
[01:24:23.977 --> 01:24:34.966]  And some of these ideas, such as the notion that ray beams from space knock the towers down, and real commercial jets did not hit the towers.
[01:24:35.447 --> 01:24:41.672]  You know, it's okay to raise a hypothesis, but it should be done in a civil fashion, first of all.
[01:24:42.466 --> 01:24:48.609]  And then, we should be able to look at the data and sort through.
[01:24:48.769 --> 01:24:54.092]  I mean, if the data goes against the hypothesis, then we should say, well, I guess that one we have to abandon.
[01:24:54.112 --> 01:24:55.633]  Let's take the next one.
[01:24:56.313 --> 01:24:59.695]  And this is what we do, of course, in the Journal of 9-11 Studies.
[01:24:59.735 --> 01:25:04.278]  There are papers on each of these topics that we've mentioned.
[01:25:04.298 --> 01:25:10.261]  The Ray Beams from Space, the idea of no-plane-hit-the-towers theory,
[01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:13.841]  There's a paper by Salter regarding that.
[01:25:14.782 --> 01:25:16.783]  Hypothesis, a very good paper.
[01:25:17.244 --> 01:25:21.367]  And then also the idea about mini-nukes in the towers.
[01:25:22.227 --> 01:25:26.551]  There's a letter, a letter A, in the Journal of 9-1-1 Studies.
[01:25:26.591 --> 01:25:35.778]  So, and you know, these folks, I invite them to write replies, say, look, maybe we overlooked some data, but that's the way we should do this, not by, gosh,
[01:25:38.443 --> 01:25:49.472]  Yeah, I mean an academic in England wrote up a paper that was pretty scientific, so we posted it talking about where there are many nukes.
[01:25:49.532 --> 01:25:59.559]  I mean, look at everything, but if people just scream and yell and say, you must believe us now or you're a traitor, then they have no evidence but swelling up like a toad.
[01:26:01.401 --> 01:26:07.946]  Exactly, that's the point Alex, and so as we sort through and then home in on that
[01:26:08.567 --> 01:26:16.572]  Now the goals then, finding the truth, yes, sorting through various pieces of evidence and bringing new evidence forth.
[01:26:16.592 --> 01:26:20.654]  You mentioned these firefighters talking about the flowing molten metal.
[01:26:20.834 --> 01:26:21.935]  I thought that was just exciting.
[01:26:21.955 --> 01:26:24.876]  And that just came out recently as far as I could see.
[01:26:25.877 --> 01:26:31.100]  And the flowing metal out of the South Tower, that was about a year ago now, that that really hit.
[01:26:32.381 --> 01:26:35.763]  And as we absorb that and look at that data,
[01:26:36.667 --> 01:26:37.227]  Overwhelming.
[01:26:37.367 --> 01:26:41.028]  All the new data that comes out affirms your basic scientific research.
[01:26:41.188 --> 01:26:42.068]  Because it's the facts.
[01:26:42.428 --> 01:26:44.069]  Yeah, it has done that.
[01:26:44.189 --> 01:26:56.911]  And I've just written a paper I'm kind of excited about just in the last few days, finished up a paper which will be coming out regarding the information that we're getting from the dust, the World Trade Center dust.
[01:26:57.271 --> 01:27:05.193]  And so this is analyses, solid work then with microscopes and electron microscopes and
[01:27:06.042 --> 01:27:07.523]  X-ray fluorescence and so on.
[01:27:07.683 --> 01:27:09.763]  That paper will be coming out.
[01:27:09.783 --> 01:27:14.365]  You talked about the goals, Alex, and that's so important.
[01:27:14.385 --> 01:27:21.207]  In this letter, in the Journal of 911 Studies, my letter C, I do talk about goals.
[01:27:22.427 --> 01:27:25.588]  Of course, I encourage everyone to think, you know, what are the goals?
[01:27:27.068 --> 01:27:31.590]  It seems to me that the first goal that we need to get now is
[01:27:33.444 --> 01:27:42.066]  Getting the government, NIST, FBI, EPA to release data that we know that they have that relates to 9-11.
[01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:46.728]  And just releasing that data, that's actually my first goal for this year.
[01:27:46.748 --> 01:27:49.008]  If I had a New Year's resolution, that would be it.
[01:27:49.028 --> 01:27:58.811]  I want to do all I can to get the release of those photographs and videos and other information from NIST and the other
[01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:00.368]  ...government groups.
[01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:04.269]  We know, for instance, that NIST has over 6,800 photographs.
[01:28:04.329 --> 01:28:07.590]  They said that in their report.
[01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:10.271]  And over 300 hours of videos.
[01:28:10.291 --> 01:28:12.151]  Well, we want to get those and look at them.
[01:28:12.532 --> 01:28:12.892]  Stay there.
[01:28:12.912 --> 01:28:13.592]  We've got a break again.
[01:28:13.672 --> 01:28:15.312]  Long segment coming up to detail.
[01:28:15.732 --> 01:28:17.933]  Goals that you think are important that I agree with.
[01:28:17.993 --> 01:28:19.273]  I've read your report.
[01:28:19.914 --> 01:28:24.115]  We'll be right back and we'll also try to get you to give us a preview of the DUS study.
[01:28:24.655 --> 01:28:25.115]  Stay with us.
[01:28:29.602 --> 01:28:32.584]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:33.525 --> 01:28:36.187]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:40.026 --> 01:28:44.007]  I found this company online and they have this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[01:28:44.227 --> 01:28:47.769]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[01:28:48.049 --> 01:28:52.130]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:53.370]  I was so amazed.
[01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:56.431]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[01:28:56.611 --> 01:28:58.492]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[01:28:58.892 --> 01:29:04.074]  Saltlywellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[01:29:04.554 --> 01:29:10.478]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan salt.
[01:29:10.738 --> 01:29:12.459]  I figured it would clean really well.
[01:29:12.719 --> 01:29:15.922]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[01:29:16.102 --> 01:29:19.984]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[01:29:20.244 --> 01:29:21.765]  Plus, the service was great.
[01:29:22.066 --> 01:29:26.749]  If you're interested in natural homeopathic time-tested remedies, visit soleilwellness.com.
[01:29:30.051 --> 01:29:37.515]  That's S-O-L-A-Y Wellness dot com, or call 312-224-2710.
[01:29:37.535 --> 01:29:37.956]  312-224-2710.
[01:29:39.777 --> 01:29:43.399]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:29:43.619 --> 01:29:44.480]  Look no further!
[01:29:44.780 --> 01:29:47.362]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:56.067]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:29:56.127 --> 01:29:56.768]  We're good to go.
[01:30:13.971 --> 01:30:14.311]  I don't know.
[01:30:41.522 --> 01:30:45.664]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[01:30:45.884 --> 01:30:47.645]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[01:30:47.905 --> 01:30:54.187]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[01:30:54.488 --> 01:31:00.610]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[01:31:00.850 --> 01:31:06.873]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions
[01:31:07.173 --> 01:31:13.577]  With no side effects, the 2006 Biosolutions Plus is the easiest to operate frequency instrument ever developed.
[01:31:13.737 --> 01:31:17.260]  It's easy reference guide will allow you to begin using the instrument within minutes.
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.282]  Simple step-by-step instructions using pictures are easy to follow.
[01:31:21.463 --> 01:31:24.004]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:24.124 --> 01:31:25.145]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:25.145 --> 01:31:25.585]  I think so.
[01:31:51.556 --> 01:31:54.920]  We'll be taking a few calls from Professor Jones before he leaves us here at the end of the hour.
[01:32:08.897 --> 01:32:15.101]  And what the IRS is doing in the North American Union in America, Freedom to Fascism, available at Infowars.com.
[01:32:15.542 --> 01:32:27.610]  We've got big discounts on it and other films we carry, other books we carry, and the 15 films I've made, of course, they're at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139 or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:32:38.971 --> 01:32:59.165]  Going back to Dr. Stephen Jones, continuing with demanding and trying to get NIST to release all these hundreds of hours of video and these thousands of photographs, please continue with what you think are really goals that are serious and can move forward the investigation.
[01:32:59.605 --> 01:33:03.868]  Alright, let me mention another area that I'm curious about, Alex.
[01:33:03.928 --> 01:33:07.571]  I haven't studied the Pentagon strike as much, but
[01:33:08.004 --> 01:33:20.591]  We know that there are videos that were seized by the FBI just shortly after the Pentagon was hit from, for instance, the nearby hotels and the Virginia Department of Transportation.
[01:33:21.092 --> 01:33:23.233]  We'd like to see the release of those too, I would say.
[01:33:23.753 --> 01:33:24.614]  That would be a goal.
[01:33:24.794 --> 01:33:26.055]  Let's get these data.
[01:33:26.515 --> 01:33:30.337]  We hope for increased transparency in our government and openness.
[01:33:30.938 --> 01:33:33.299]  But look what's coming out now on
[01:33:34.236 --> 01:33:48.819]  What the government, the administration, I should say, did relative to scientific studies of global warming, you know, and apparently suppressing some of those reports.
[01:33:49.059 --> 01:33:51.599]  It's the same thing here, except more so.
[01:33:51.799 --> 01:34:01.001]  I mean, we know that these photographs and videos are being held by NIST and the FBI, taken from
[01:34:03.041 --> 01:34:13.626]  Private individuals are, well, I wouldn't say taken, at government taxpayer expense, they were collected, in other words, from private individuals.
[01:34:13.706 --> 01:34:18.548]  In many cases, these 6,000 plus photographs that were taken that day.
[01:34:19.028 --> 01:34:28.432]  Particularly, we'd like to see the photos of Building 7, and NIST has been very reluctant to release these photos.
[01:34:29.448 --> 01:34:32.530]  You know, if there's nothing to hide, then let's get this on the table.
[01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:56.663]  So yes, I was contacted by a person who has been in with one of the presidential candidates, and the interest there is not a statement that they necessarily come down one way or the other about what happened on 9-11, but they do agree that the government should exercise
[01:34:58.570 --> 01:35:07.293]  more transparency and allow these photos and videos to be released to the public and to scientists and engineers in particular.
[01:35:07.333 --> 01:35:11.995]  We'll take a close look and let's, you know, get these data on the table.
[01:35:12.795 --> 01:35:23.799]  This is a new development, of course, that can really affect our movement with these candidates showing interest in some of our goals, at least, releasing data being one of them.
[01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:25.300]  Really pleased to
[01:35:26.014 --> 01:35:31.357]  You know, it's funny that you brought up global warming, just totally changing subjects.
[01:35:31.537 --> 01:35:33.178]  I've never asked you your opinion of it.
[01:35:33.198 --> 01:35:34.639]  I don't know your view on it.
[01:35:34.659 --> 01:35:37.621]  And you just brought that up.
[01:35:37.661 --> 01:35:48.467]  Let me, from my layman's study of this, tell you where I come from, Dr. Jones, and then give us your take on it.
[01:35:49.929 --> 01:35:51.470]  There's massive hype right now.
[01:35:51.991 --> 01:35:55.193]  Prince Charles won't fly his jet to a meeting because of the Earth.
[01:35:55.573 --> 01:35:58.455]  They're going to turn the Eiffel Tower off at night because of the Earth.
[01:36:00.197 --> 01:36:03.219]  The NFL is going to do a bunch of stuff to not destroy the Earth.
[01:36:03.977 --> 01:36:09.360]  And the message is that it's not all the chemicals and biologicals being developed and dumped.
[01:36:09.380 --> 01:36:10.461]  It's all our cars.
[01:36:10.921 --> 01:36:21.228]  And then the solution, whether you believe it's real or not, is a global tax on fossil fuels, a North American Union, and we now have their internal documents, and control.
[01:36:21.288 --> 01:36:25.490]  So we know that their solution, whether the problem's real or not, isn't a solution.
[01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:29.052]  They're just using it as a way to get more control.
[01:36:31.825 --> 01:36:39.336]  I know the ice core samples from 12,000 years ago show that we have these heating and cooling cycles.
[01:36:40.077 --> 01:36:45.866]  I know that clearly we have got the climate change getting colder in some areas, hotter than others.
[01:36:46.711 --> 01:36:50.753]  They're saying the Earth is, what, a degree and a half hotter than it was a hundred years ago on average.
[01:36:51.233 --> 01:36:54.494]  We know certain parts of the ocean are getting hotter, other parts are getting colder.
[01:36:55.274 --> 01:36:57.915]  We know that ice shelves are always breaking off and rebuilding.
[01:36:58.335 --> 01:37:08.239]  We know all this is going on, but the big thing that I've seen from NASA and from all the big university studies and the different satellites and observatories
[01:37:09.534 --> 01:37:23.932]  Is that they thought the last 11 year plus sun cycle, almost 12 year sun cycle, was the biggest emissions ever of different types of radiation from the sun, you know, all forms, the entire band, the entire spectrum.
[01:37:24.645 --> 01:37:31.711]  And they know from, they can examine the moons that were ice that are now melting around Saturn and Jupiter.
[01:37:31.731 --> 01:37:33.653]  They know that Mercury is hotter.
[01:37:33.673 --> 01:37:37.657]  They know that the entire solar system, including even the Kuiper belt,
[01:37:40.599 --> 01:37:42.400]  That's a tough question actually.
[01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:50.284]  Of course my point, I'll try to address that, but I want to just emphasize that my point was that the administration is suppressing
[01:38:08.694 --> 01:38:15.679]  Some of these papers that scientists are objecting to, you know, sort of a censorship almost of their papers.
[01:38:15.759 --> 01:38:19.301]  And this is what I'm concerned about relative to 9-11.
[01:38:19.401 --> 01:38:21.042]  Let's open this up.
[01:38:21.062 --> 01:38:23.864]  Let's get the data out from NIST, for example.
[01:38:23.884 --> 01:38:25.025]  Get it on the table.
[01:38:25.065 --> 01:38:28.127]  Let's discuss it without stigmas attached.
[01:38:28.167 --> 01:38:35.732]  You know, let's look at these data and have a free go at the information, which is what we should have.
[01:38:37.868 --> 01:38:42.471]  And Bush is doing the same thing with climate evidence.
[01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:45.132]  So you're just saying whatever it is, it needs to come out.
[01:38:45.733 --> 01:38:46.713]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:46.813 --> 01:38:57.140]  And to be honest, on the global warming, I have not probed the data sufficiently to come to a conclusion as to whether it's man-made or not.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:04.925]  But I do agree with you that there are entities and efforts to turn this sort of
[01:39:05.979 --> 01:39:08.261]  Anything that scares people, it seems like.
[01:39:09.021 --> 01:39:15.326]  They'll turn that into an excuse for diminishing freedoms and expanding the North American Union.
[01:39:15.426 --> 01:39:20.350]  Finally, this New World Order that does seem to be a goal that the other side has.
[01:39:20.550 --> 01:39:26.595]  We should have our goals and pursue them fairly focused, such as getting the information on exposing
[01:39:27.185 --> 01:39:29.466]  These activities, as you're doing a great job.
[01:39:30.106 --> 01:39:35.828]  Well, Dr. Jones, on the global warming front, it's like they flipped a switch four or five months ago.
[01:39:36.168 --> 01:39:46.092]  The Weather Channel, the Super Bowl, everybody, the French, I mean, it's just everyone's saying it's real now, it's over, we've got to have a global tax to save us.
[01:39:46.452 --> 01:39:55.175]  And then we just got, a few months ago, I have them right here, Judicial Watch got the actual minutes of our leaders, the Canadian and Mexican leaders, and a bunch of CEOs,
[01:39:55.695 --> 01:39:56.356]  We're good to go.
[01:40:14.406 --> 01:40:22.113]  Let's get the data out, let people look at it, and not use these scare tactics, which are just getting a little bit annoying, aren't they?
[01:40:22.133 --> 01:40:23.814]  They are, but there's clearly no debate.
[01:40:23.855 --> 01:40:26.016]  I mean, I know you read a lot of the papers that are out there.
[01:40:26.036 --> 01:40:29.700]  I mean, it's all over the place that the sun is really going crazy.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:30.621]  That's right.
[01:40:31.121 --> 01:40:33.523]  That's exactly right, and it could very well be.
[01:40:33.543 --> 01:40:39.909]  In fact, I talked to an expert in this area here, the same Dr. Peterson.
[01:40:40.498 --> 01:40:46.482]  His feeling was that it's the sun, really, cycling that is causing this current global warming.
[01:40:48.063 --> 01:40:48.863]  And gee whiz!
[01:40:48.923 --> 01:40:50.064]  What's the big heat source?
[01:40:50.785 --> 01:40:52.946]  Other than geothermal, it's the sun!
[01:40:53.486 --> 01:40:55.007]  It's mainly the sun, that's for sure.
[01:40:55.548 --> 01:40:56.869]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:58.730 --> 01:40:59.790]  Give out your website again.
[01:40:59.810 --> 01:41:02.092]  We've got links to it up on InfoWars.com.
[01:41:02.392 --> 01:41:03.313]  Great, thank you.
[01:41:04.273 --> 01:41:07.956]  Well, I'm associated with this group now, Scholars for 9-11 Truth and Justice.
[01:41:10.407 --> 01:41:18.049]  We're trying to emphasize the goals here and stick with the scientific evidentiary facts as best we can.
[01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:23.430]  And the website is stj911.org.
[01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:33.612]  And also we're of course encouraging people to read the papers in journalof911studies.com.
[01:41:33.813 --> 01:41:35.693]  There's an excellent paper that's been overlooked there.
[01:41:35.733 --> 01:41:39.534]  I think by many it's by Joseph Firmage and he talks about
[01:41:41.179 --> 01:41:44.000]  Data beyond just the hard physical evidence.
[01:41:44.241 --> 01:41:45.821]  I just thought that was an excellent paper.
[01:41:45.861 --> 01:41:46.982]  I'd recommend people reading.
[01:41:47.242 --> 01:41:48.423]  What about the dust data?
[01:41:48.463 --> 01:41:49.663]  Can you give us a hint of that paper?
[01:41:49.683 --> 01:41:51.944]  Yeah, let me give you a little heads up.
[01:41:52.024 --> 01:41:56.586]  So I did talk about this some at University of California, Berkeley in November.
[01:41:56.687 --> 01:41:59.068]  And so now I'm trying to put this on paper.
[01:41:59.848 --> 01:42:03.250]  And it is, of course, as a scientist, it's fascinating.
[01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:09.493]  We're getting into looking for forensic evidence that would point to the use of
[01:42:10.816 --> 01:42:14.739]  Pyrotechnics, in other words, accelerants in the building.
[01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:28.210]  And of course, I'm referring particularly to thermite and thermate, which would produce molten iron as well as aluminum oxide powder as an end product.
[01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:32.313]  There'd be sulfur around to make this hot molten iron cut through steel.
[01:42:33.034 --> 01:42:37.317]  Now you melt the steel too, you know, and cut through the steel.
[01:42:39.659 --> 01:42:40.080]  There's the
[01:42:40.894 --> 01:42:44.797]  Explosive form of thermite, which is called super thermite.
[01:42:45.737 --> 01:42:51.241]  And that goes back to the early 90s discussions of that and how to make it in large quantities.
[01:42:51.281 --> 01:42:52.582]  So now patented.
[01:42:53.482 --> 01:42:54.343]  It is patented.
[01:42:54.363 --> 01:42:54.523]  Yeah.
[01:42:55.144 --> 01:43:01.208]  The dust does show, of course, we're trying to sort out from building materials.
[01:43:01.228 --> 01:43:02.148]  That's the tricky part.
[01:43:02.709 --> 01:43:10.634]  But the dust does show very high levels of iron and sulfur and aluminum as well as well as zinc.
[01:43:11.403 --> 01:43:18.246]  Barium, barium is a toxic substance, and manganese.
[01:43:19.586 --> 01:43:23.127]  And so, and by the way, this is not just my study of the dust.
[01:43:23.187 --> 01:43:31.310]  I do have a sample, which I talked about in the paper, and the chain of custody is described and very well established.
[01:43:31.511 --> 01:43:33.351]  So let's walk through this and then continue.
[01:43:33.391 --> 01:43:35.292]  I don't want to interrupt, but this is important.
[01:43:36.085 --> 01:43:43.113]  We've got the firefighters on multiple occasions saying explosions, bombs going off, hundreds of other witnesses, emergency workers.
[01:43:43.414 --> 01:43:48.379]  We have the buildings being pulverized into fine dust, which even if it did collapse wouldn't happen.
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:49.901]  We have Building 7 falling.
[01:43:49.921 --> 01:43:55.428]  We have firefighters saying molten steel running down the channel rails like a steel foundry or the inside of a volcano.
[01:43:56.388 --> 01:44:03.751]  We have the high-altitude aircraft infrared scan showing 2,700 over 3,000 degrees.
[01:44:03.811 --> 01:44:04.672]  Totally impossible.
[01:44:04.932 --> 01:44:08.213]  Three, four, five weeks after in huge molten pits.
[01:44:09.093 --> 01:44:14.756]  And then we have you getting two separate samples, which you do have chain of custody of, but you don't want to blow your sources on that.
[01:44:14.796 --> 01:44:16.436]  But now you do have chain of custody.
[01:44:16.456 --> 01:44:19.818]  You are announcing and publishing on DUSH showing the exact same thing.
[01:44:20.398 --> 01:44:21.719]  And it just goes from there.
[01:44:21.739 --> 01:44:22.459]  I mean, this is just...
[01:44:23.099 --> 01:44:39.247]  In science, for those that don't know, if you just continually confirm, confirm, confirm, confirm, confirm, confirm, confirm, confirm, confirmation after confirmation, and it fits in with patented systems, I mean, it's getting pretty clear.
[01:44:39.707 --> 01:44:45.429]  It is getting very clear, and certainly enough to motivate this investigation that we're calling for.
[01:44:45.509 --> 01:44:47.811]  And I'm glad to see presidential candidates saying,
[01:44:49.281 --> 01:44:55.164]  Maybe there's something here that will help boost my campaign, distinguish it from the other guys.
[01:44:55.484 --> 01:45:01.928]  I want to get the truth about 9-11, where I encourage them to speak along those lines.
[01:45:02.148 --> 01:45:05.710]  Let me go back to those other guys, since you bring that up, some of the people that are discrediting things.
[01:45:09.830 --> 01:45:35.087]  Very rare a blue moon that you or I get invited on national TV or we do it gets cancelled because we'll lay out facts, you'll do it in a calm fashion, I'll do it in a riveting fashion, but then you'll do it in a very convincing fashion, but then people that look like complete absolute buffoons are just constantly out there, but by the way, people are seeing through them.
[01:45:35.695 --> 01:45:35.895]  Yeah.
[01:45:36.535 --> 01:45:38.916]  It's an interesting point, Alex.
[01:45:38.996 --> 01:45:41.097]  And by the way, your style I really enjoy.
[01:45:41.577 --> 01:45:42.577]  It's just different from mine.
[01:45:42.597 --> 01:45:44.498]  We complement each other, you know.
[01:45:44.658 --> 01:45:45.658]  Well, it sounds obnoxious.
[01:45:45.698 --> 01:45:46.298]  I say riveting.
[01:45:46.318 --> 01:45:49.960]  But, you know, I mean, I compellingly lay out evidence, and so do you.
[01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:50.700]  Yeah.
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.120]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:46:04.004]  By the way, one piece of evidence that I emphasize is this sulfidation that has been reported by... It was in the FEMA report, Appendix C, and then NIST
[01:46:04.552 --> 01:46:16.636]  And, you know, in this appendix they say, look, we see high temperature, quote for it, severe high temperature corrosion attack on the steel, including sulfidation, with subsequent intergranular melting.
[01:46:17.276 --> 01:46:21.557]  And then they say no clear explanation for the source of the sulfur has been identified.
[01:46:22.118 --> 01:46:23.818]  So now, you know, that's a big red flag.
[01:46:24.018 --> 01:46:26.859]  That's another confirmation on all your independent research.
[01:46:27.099 --> 01:46:28.920]  It is totally another confirmation.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:31.301]  And, you know, so what does NIST do?
[01:46:31.321 --> 01:46:32.541]  They just ignore that.
[01:46:34.940 --> 01:46:37.782]  And I just am amazed that they can get away with that.
[01:46:37.842 --> 01:46:42.525]  But you know, as scientists, you say, wait, you have to face up to these data.
[01:46:42.785 --> 01:46:59.035]  And by the way, critics of me very rarely, I don't recall anyone saying, well, well, I guess I can think of one guy, but his explanation was not very good about the sulfidation, you know, and the, and also the liquid metal pouring out of the tower and, and so on.
[01:47:00.478 --> 01:47:10.181]  We have these very suspicious characters focusing their attack on you because you've got evidence that's scientific and destroys the whole story.
[01:47:10.941 --> 01:47:12.661]  Yeah, I agree with you, it does.
[01:47:12.941 --> 01:47:16.782]  And it's kind of disturbing.
[01:47:16.802 --> 01:47:20.223]  I hate to see it too, it's in the movement.
[01:47:20.263 --> 01:47:23.824]  But if we can just get together and say, okay, we're going to sort through some of this.
[01:47:23.864 --> 01:47:26.445]  Let's not let the weaker evidence hold us back.
[01:47:26.485 --> 01:47:27.405]  We're going to put that off.
[01:47:27.961 --> 01:47:39.783]  We've written up articles about it now, and explained why we're not going to keep being distracted by the no planes hitting the towers idea, or the space beams, you know, the beams from space.
[01:47:40.924 --> 01:47:49.025]  We've written papers about that now, so let's put them aside, because let's focus on what's going to get us to the goal of justice here, and peace.
[01:47:49.785 --> 01:47:51.306]  Well, take the space beams.
[01:47:51.446 --> 01:47:52.826]  I mean, take the space beams.
[01:47:53.385 --> 01:47:53.585]  Sure.
[01:47:53.765 --> 01:48:03.172]  Instead of there being no evidence for it, there's actually the contrary, because I've actually interviewed former heads of direct energy weapons programs, former heads of Star Wars.
[01:48:03.312 --> 01:48:06.915]  I've actually been somewhat of a buff, finding it was interesting since I was a teenager.
[01:48:07.416 --> 01:48:10.078]  Direct energy weapons don't act like this, don't do this.
[01:48:10.618 --> 01:48:12.739]  It doesn't, it isn't consistent with the collapses.
[01:48:13.100 --> 01:48:13.980]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:14.321 --> 01:48:17.643]  Instead of there being no evidence, there's only evidence to the contrary.
[01:48:17.963 --> 01:48:18.644]  That's correct.
[01:48:18.864 --> 01:48:19.284]  That's correct.
[01:48:20.419 --> 01:48:22.541]  As we look at the evidence, we sort things out.
[01:48:22.601 --> 01:48:24.462]  We say, okay, this goes on the shelf now.
[01:48:24.842 --> 01:48:26.683]  We're done with the space beam.
[01:48:26.904 --> 01:48:29.245]  Well, for instance, looking at the North Tower.
[01:48:29.705 --> 01:48:31.767]  Alex, you and I have looked at that a number of times.
[01:48:31.807 --> 01:48:35.870]  A beam from above, from space, has to start at the tippy top.
[01:48:36.230 --> 01:48:38.992]  There's no way you can skip 15 floors and start down
[01:48:39.728 --> 01:48:41.389]  I can imagine, you know, a beam from space.
[01:48:41.529 --> 01:48:56.554]  Well, more than that, all the laser studies show they have to go through mirrors, and even lasers the sizes of huge buildings can barely even shoot down a missile, and there's also atmospheric inversion, which distorts.
[01:48:56.594 --> 01:49:05.697]  You're shooting through the equivalent of 30 feet of water and about 3 inches of rock that is actually in the atmosphere, aerosolized.
[01:49:05.757 --> 01:49:06.718]  It's ridiculous!
[01:49:07.958 --> 01:49:08.999]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:09.019 --> 01:49:14.961]  You know how hard it is for us to shoot down a missile with our ABM system, and now they want to shoot down a building.
[01:49:15.762 --> 01:49:17.923]  You see?
[01:49:18.643 --> 01:49:21.385]  Okay.
[01:49:22.005 --> 01:49:24.546]  Well, now they're trying to say it was ground-based weapons.
[01:49:25.126 --> 01:49:28.068]  Yeah, I've heard that too, but, you know, similar problems.
[01:49:28.288 --> 01:49:33.130]  Their problem is getting enough power to do all this destruction they want to do with it.
[01:49:33.170 --> 01:49:34.531]  Well, also, you would see it.
[01:49:34.711 --> 01:49:35.651]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:42.654 --> 01:49:45.835]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:46.176 --> 01:49:48.116]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:48.476 --> 01:49:56.140]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:50:03.883]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:04.263 --> 01:50:11.146]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[01:50:11.641 --> 01:50:15.683]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:16.003 --> 01:50:19.504]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:19.964 --> 01:50:21.885]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:22.225 --> 01:50:26.147]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:39.534 --> 01:50:44.736]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:44.896 --> 01:50:52.979]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:50:53.239 --> 01:51:00.281]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:00.481 --> 01:51:01.741]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:01.841 --> 01:51:07.742]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:07.922 --> 01:51:13.003]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:13.123 --> 01:51:21.985]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:51.464]  Welcome back!
[01:53:19.449 --> 01:53:21.251]  Professor Stephen Jones is our guest.
[01:53:21.311 --> 01:53:24.634]  I hope to keep him just five minutes to the next hour so I have time to get to all your calls.
[01:53:25.234 --> 01:53:33.462]  Professor, anything else you wanted to add before we go to Steve, Chris, Michael, and others that are patiently holding to talk to you?
[01:53:33.902 --> 01:53:35.164]  Yeah, let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:53:35.444 --> 01:53:36.084]  Fantastic.
[01:53:36.145 --> 01:53:37.886]  Chris in West Virginia, thanks for holding.
[01:53:38.206 --> 01:53:39.848]  You're on the air with Stephen Jones.
[01:53:40.128 --> 01:53:40.388]  Hi.
[01:53:40.469 --> 01:53:41.329]  Hi, Dr. Jones.
[01:53:41.349 --> 01:53:41.750]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:42.845 --> 01:53:49.270]  Um, I just wanted to comment, really, I called in quite a while ago, and, um, I've been on hold, but... That's fine, sir, go ahead.
[01:53:49.390 --> 01:54:12.147]  Okay, but everything that you've been saying, uh, pretty much with the whole 9-1-1 truth movement, and, uh, ties in with this whole thing with CNN, and, uh, what Paula Zahn has said, and, uh... Yeah, Space Beams, Jews, uh, no planes, you know, it's just... Yeah, that's right, that's what... They're basically saying that since they can't credibly discredit the truth movement, it must be racially motivated.
[01:54:12.765 --> 01:54:35.920]  I find that it's despicable, and it's evil, and rather than, of course, they cannot debunk any of the facts that you guys have presented, so... Yeah, Professor Jones isn't saying who did it, he's just going, look, we're being lied to, and that's how you have to scientifically approach this, first proving the whole story's a fraud, then you can find out who did it.
[01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.361]  Right, exactly.
[01:54:39.454 --> 01:54:46.098]  Well, it seems to me that, um, you know, when there's, when there's no way to debunk something, they can't refute the facts, basically.
[01:54:46.318 --> 01:54:52.821]  And it seems like, so they're resorting to this, this racism card, like with some sort of Trump card or an ace up their sleeve.
[01:54:52.922 --> 01:54:53.962]  Basically, they have nothing.
[01:54:54.002 --> 01:54:56.844]  They're also promoting it, then they introduce it into the mind.
[01:54:57.044 --> 01:55:04.368]  Well, they introduce it into the mind and also it becomes one of these, uh, it falls under the umbrella of one of these hate crime laws and then take it from there.
[01:55:04.933 --> 01:55:07.455]  You know, it becomes an attack on freedom of speech.
[01:55:07.575 --> 01:55:12.719]  There's been a call to say 9-11 Truth in Europe and the US should be banned because it is racism.
[01:55:12.759 --> 01:55:17.643]  I mean, and we played a UT Liberals this weekend protesting saying, no more 9-11 Truth!
[01:55:18.404 --> 01:55:19.004]  Racism!
[01:55:19.425 --> 01:55:20.305]  That's despicable.
[01:55:20.385 --> 01:55:23.928]  I mean, anyone, that's saying that anyone seeking the truth is a racist.
[01:55:24.048 --> 01:55:26.350]  It's not going to work, but Professor Jones, you want to comment?
[01:55:27.251 --> 01:55:31.214]  Well, no, but I do agree with the caller that this is a
[01:55:32.177 --> 01:55:34.318]  A despicable approach that they are using.
[01:55:34.579 --> 01:55:57.152]  And it is interesting that these media people are focusing on, again, these ideas that we've been talking about that tend to discredit the movement and try to associate in the public's mind, oh, this is, you know, crazy beings from space or somehow, you know, some ethnic group involved.
[01:55:58.169 --> 01:55:58.949]  It's just, it is.
[01:55:59.350 --> 01:56:02.951]  It's disturbing to see that happen, but I guess it's predictable.
[01:56:03.532 --> 01:56:11.596]  We need to work to get the truth out without being distracted, I think, by these efforts.
[01:56:12.376 --> 01:56:24.462]  I think if you guys continue, you know, you just continue to stand your ground, present the facts as you have been presenting them, and not waver one way or the other, whether they attack you personally or they attack you with some sort of racial trump card,
[01:56:25.551 --> 01:56:26.692]  I think, you know, victory.
[01:56:26.852 --> 01:56:27.572]  You guys will win.
[01:56:27.852 --> 01:56:28.212]  I hear it.
[01:56:28.252 --> 01:56:29.152]  We're all going to win.
[01:56:29.653 --> 01:56:30.433]  Chris, thank you.
[01:56:30.733 --> 01:56:32.914]  I would just add that look at the polls.
[01:56:32.974 --> 01:56:34.814]  Eighty-four percent believe they're being lied to.
[01:56:35.134 --> 01:56:37.055]  Thirty-six percent believe total inside job.
[01:56:37.275 --> 01:56:39.696]  Professor Jones, these tactics aren't working.
[01:56:40.416 --> 01:56:40.696]  Right.
[01:56:40.796 --> 01:56:41.857]  No, you're right.
[01:56:41.937 --> 01:56:49.639]  And hopefully what we're seeing now is desperation tactics that others will see through.
[01:56:49.659 --> 01:56:52.400]  Well, it's like calling Galileo a heretic.
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:53.881]  Yep, exactly.
[01:56:53.901 --> 01:56:54.401]  It didn't work.
[01:56:55.049 --> 01:56:55.970]  No, it didn't work.
[01:56:56.010 --> 01:56:59.032]  Finally, the truth does cut its way through, you know.
[01:56:59.932 --> 01:57:00.793]  Like a space beam!
[01:57:05.115 --> 01:57:06.336]  We've got a 70 second break.
[01:57:06.416 --> 01:57:07.557]  Five more minutes on the other side.
[01:57:07.577 --> 01:57:08.317]  Can you do it, Professor?
[01:57:08.578 --> 01:57:08.778]  Sure.
[01:57:09.118 --> 01:57:12.100]  Okay, and then we're going to get Aaron Russo on from Los Angeles.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:15.382]  We'll be right back with more of your phone calls.
[01:57:19.338 --> 01:57:23.399]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:23.419 --> 01:57:24.300]  More than... Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:57:38.903 --> 01:57:40.004]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:40.644 --> 01:57:41.485]  You want answers?
[01:57:42.245 --> 01:57:43.106]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:43.126 --> 01:57:47.729]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:47.989 --> 01:57:52.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:57:52.952 --> 01:57:56.815]  Final segment with Professor of Physics, Dr. Stephen Jones.
[01:57:57.855 --> 01:58:04.840]  And then we've got Aaron Russo, fighting cancer, joining us from Los Angeles, California, talking about Ron Paul's presidential run, State of the Union,
[01:58:06.051 --> 01:58:06.912]  Global warming.
[01:58:06.932 --> 01:58:09.213]  We're going to cover it all this next hour and open phones.
[01:58:09.594 --> 01:58:11.675]  Two final calls for Professor Jones.
[01:58:12.095 --> 01:58:13.616]  Michael in Ohio, then Anthony.
[01:58:14.097 --> 01:58:15.858]  Michael, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:58:16.738 --> 01:58:17.979]  Yes, how you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:58:18.359 --> 01:58:19.120]  Just fine, thanks.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:21.421]  Good, and how you doing, Mr. Alex Jones?
[01:58:21.581 --> 01:58:24.423]  I'm okay, man.
[01:58:24.483 --> 01:58:25.004]  Good, good.
[01:58:25.914 --> 01:58:27.855]  I just want to commend you for your fine work.
[01:58:28.255 --> 01:58:32.937]  I've actually heard of you before, Dr. Stephen Jones, from the Theosophical Society.
[01:58:33.358 --> 01:58:36.179]  Now, I don't know why they mention you, but they praise you, too.
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:38.820]  And that's a secret society.
[01:58:39.861 --> 01:58:40.681]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:58:40.881 --> 01:58:42.342]  Yeah, that's what they say.
[01:58:42.402 --> 01:58:43.142]  That's what they say.
[01:58:43.202 --> 01:58:51.026]  I mean, that's not what it is, but I just wanted to ask you a couple questions, you and Alex, a couple questions.
[01:58:52.727 --> 01:58:53.848]  I've been doing research with 9-11.
[01:58:55.191 --> 01:58:57.152]  I've been doing research with secret societies.
[01:58:57.252 --> 01:59:18.003]  I've been doing my own powerful research and I've come to the conclusion that, you know, the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg, you know, they all have a part in what goes on as what's been going on, but I want to know who would be the most powerful societies.
[01:59:18.864 --> 01:59:21.005]  Okay, well this is my expertise, let me just tell you.
[01:59:21.778 --> 01:59:43.714]  The Bilderberg Group is 125 of the most powerful people in the world, but really only about 50 of them are the real power brokers, and then they direct the shadow governments, like the Royal Institute of International Affairs in England, or the Council on Foreign Relations with 4,000 members here domestically, and then most of them are just compartmentalized and are just sharing in the power structure and don't have the whole picture.
[01:59:44.074 --> 01:59:46.316]  So people think, well, does this group or does that group run it?
[01:59:47.877 --> 01:59:54.401]  The five or six big groups that are out there are all chaired by 15 or 20 people, and they're all members of the other groups.
[01:59:54.901 --> 02:00:10.612]  So these are just different management arms, like the Trilateral Commission mainly focuses in on economic integration between Japan, Europe, and the U.S., and then the CFR just manages the U.S., so it's just different components of the same machine.
[02:00:10.632 --> 02:00:13.113]  It's one watch you're looking at, and it's different parts.
[02:00:13.153 --> 02:00:13.994]  Thank you for the call.
[02:00:14.314 --> 02:00:15.395]  You want to comment on that, Professor?
[02:00:16.129 --> 02:00:18.591]  No, you're the expert on that.
[02:00:19.131 --> 02:00:20.992]  I find it fascinating, but let's go ahead.
[02:00:21.573 --> 02:00:23.454]  Last caller here, Anthony in New York.
[02:00:23.474 --> 02:00:23.914]  Go ahead.
[02:00:24.634 --> 02:00:28.897]  Dr. Jones, I'm a great admirer of yours, and a quick comment.
[02:00:29.277 --> 02:00:31.059]  Illegitimous non-carborundum.
[02:00:31.979 --> 02:00:39.304]  Let me say, we have up here in the 20th Congressional District in Upstate New York a new Congresswoman Gillibrand.
[02:00:39.324 --> 02:00:44.627]  She held a town hall meeting for the first time in the history of our district this past Monday, January 29, 2007.
[02:00:46.471 --> 02:00:50.932]  And I got the second question on the floor in front of the television cameras and the newspaper reporters.
[02:00:51.593 --> 02:00:55.014]  I stood up and said, when will Congress investigate what happened to Building 7?
[02:00:55.254 --> 02:00:58.555]  And three buildings came down.
[02:00:58.915 --> 02:01:03.216]  I mentioned Dr. Stephens Jones' work in finding a thermate.
[02:01:03.596 --> 02:01:08.018]  I urged her to contact Dr. Jones to find out the truth about it.
[02:01:08.478 --> 02:01:12.099]  I mentioned no airplane hit Building 7.
[02:01:13.092 --> 02:01:26.717]  How NIST changed its reports online, Larry Silverstein's comment in the free-fall speech, and ended with a question saying, when will Congress have a real open scientific investigation?
[02:01:26.737 --> 02:01:27.337]  And what did they do?
[02:01:27.417 --> 02:01:28.618]  Quickly, because I want to hear the rest of it.
[02:01:28.778 --> 02:01:29.198]  What happened?
[02:01:30.418 --> 02:01:37.761]  There was a round of applause from a chunk of the audience, and she had a very serious look on her face
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:41.462]  And she said, uh, that I don't know the answer to that.
[02:01:41.563 --> 02:01:43.984]  I don't know about that issue, but I will look into it.
[02:01:44.084 --> 02:01:46.406]  And she was taking notes while I was speaking.
[02:01:46.666 --> 02:01:47.427]  Let me just say this.
[02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:51.810]  If all of us go do that, we're going to force this to go even more big time.
[02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:53.992]  And they can't stop us if people do what you did.
[02:01:54.012 --> 02:01:54.972]  And I commend you, Anthony.
[02:01:55.153 --> 02:01:57.534]  You got the last word, Professor Jones, in the last 30 seconds.
[02:01:58.175 --> 02:02:02.238]  Well, I just also commend Anthony and others who are
[02:02:03.191 --> 02:02:09.735]  Doggedly continuing to bring up these questions and raising these now to the candidates for president.
[02:02:10.495 --> 02:02:23.303]  I mean we are going to have opportunities to keep bringing these ideas and these questions to the public and let's keep doing it and get that information out of the government so we can clear all this up.
[02:02:23.603 --> 02:02:24.623]  Good speaking with you.
[02:02:24.663 --> 02:02:27.585]  Look forward to seeing you outside Phoenix on the 23rd.
[02:02:27.625 --> 02:02:28.125]  God bless.
[02:02:28.546 --> 02:02:29.066]  Sounds great.
[02:02:29.106 --> 02:02:29.706]  Thanks Alex.
[02:02:30.367 --> 02:02:30.747]  Take care.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:33.541]  Good morning, honey.
[02:02:33.901 --> 02:02:39.906]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:40.786]  Yeah.
[02:02:41.166 --> 02:02:42.588]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[02:02:42.948 --> 02:02:46.350]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel berkey system.
[02:02:46.811 --> 02:02:48.312]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[02:02:48.752 --> 02:02:50.473]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[02:02:50.854 --> 02:02:52.615]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[02:02:52.835 --> 02:02:53.696]  Honey, cheer up.
[02:02:54.076 --> 02:02:56.339]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:02:56.599 --> 02:02:56.920]  What?
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:07.853]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[02:03:08.134 --> 02:03:12.960]  You know, this is a terrific cabin, and wow, have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[02:03:13.280 --> 02:03:14.481]  Don't ruin your vacation.
[02:03:14.561 --> 02:03:16.382]  Get a Travel Berkey today for only $209.
[02:03:16.422 --> 02:03:17.142]  Or get a Sport Berkey for only $39.
[02:03:17.182 --> 02:03:17.402]  Call 888-803-4438.
[02:03:17.422 --> 02:03:17.602]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:03:17.642 --> 02:03:18.803]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:03:18.843 --> 02:03:20.064]  Travel Berkey not available in Iowa.
[02:03:34.398 --> 02:03:34.818]  It's here!
[02:03:35.058 --> 02:03:39.841]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:40.202 --> 02:03:47.866]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:48.526 --> 02:03:55.591]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:55.991 --> 02:04:02.835]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:04:03.368 --> 02:04:07.411]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:07.712 --> 02:04:11.234]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:11.675 --> 02:04:13.576]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:13.937 --> 02:04:17.860]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:31.374 --> 02:04:32.255]  It's no secret.
[02:04:32.515 --> 02:04:37.998]  Aluminum itself adversely affects the blood-brain barrier and is capable of causing DNA damage.
[02:04:38.179 --> 02:04:42.922]  Research has even shown that aluminum salts used in antiperspirants have detrimental effects.
[02:04:43.282 --> 02:04:45.564]  So why are you still using traditional deodorant?
[02:04:45.784 --> 02:04:48.365]  Well, there is an alternative and it's called No-BO.
[02:04:48.606 --> 02:04:56.771]  No-BO eliminates the bacterial growth which causes odor and does not interfere with perspiration, which is important for allowing your body to expel toxins.
[02:04:56.951 --> 02:05:01.194]  There are no chemicals, aluminum, preservatives, or petroleum-based ingredients in No-BO.
[02:05:01.474 --> 02:05:07.696]  Just natural ingredients like grapeseed oil, arrowroot powder, silica, vitamin E, tea tree oil, and geranium.
[02:05:07.876 --> 02:05:12.017]  No-BO's job is to destroy the bacteria that causes the odor while soothing your skin.
[02:05:12.197 --> 02:05:16.558]  You can use No-BO under your arms, on tough foot odors, or for athlete's foot.
[02:05:16.718 --> 02:05:20.679]  No-BO is guaranteed 100% or receive a full refund.
[02:05:21.039 --> 02:05:23.579]  Visit No-BO.com to order.
[02:05:23.699 --> 02:05:26.520]  That's No-BO.com or call 850-723-8599.
[02:05:31.087 --> 02:05:38.813]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:42.175 --> 02:05:46.378]  In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth was a revolutionary act.
[02:05:46.859 --> 02:05:51.182]  George Orwell, you know, we hadn't seen each other's films, they weren't out, they came out around the same time.
[02:05:51.602 --> 02:05:55.005]  Both our films use that as a tag, showing we're on the same page.
[02:05:55.045 --> 02:05:56.626]  It's Aaron Russo's America
[02:05:57.296 --> 02:06:00.697]  Freedom to Fascism available at Infowars.com.
[02:06:00.717 --> 02:06:03.858]  We're going to go to him in a few minutes, but I first want to talk about this film.
[02:06:05.139 --> 02:06:07.919]  This is a movie that you must see.
[02:06:07.959 --> 02:06:10.500]  This is a movie the government must keep you from seeing.
[02:06:10.520 --> 02:06:12.921]  That's what Mike Rivera of What Really Happened said.
[02:06:12.941 --> 02:06:18.603]  A thought-provoking clarion call for the masses to wake up before it's too late.
[02:06:19.494 --> 02:06:26.437]  And that's Cam Williams, the Black Star News, a CBF News reviewer, said it's the scariest film you'll see all year.
[02:06:27.217 --> 02:06:29.438]  See the cinematic call to arms.
[02:06:29.798 --> 02:06:32.159]  That was Jeff Craig's 60-second preview.
[02:06:33.199 --> 02:06:37.521]  The scariest film you'll see this year makes Fahrenheit 9-11 look like Bambi.
[02:06:38.341 --> 02:06:39.502]  It is so important.
[02:06:39.642 --> 02:06:42.863]  Silence is golden, but when it threatens your freedom, it's yellow.
[02:06:44.439 --> 02:06:55.824]  Determined to find the law that requires American citizens to pay income tax, producer Aaron Russo, the Rose in Trading Places, set out on a journey to find the evidence.
[02:06:57.165 --> 02:07:00.486]  Neither left nor right wing, the startling examination of government
[02:07:01.744 --> 02:07:08.269]  Exposes the systematic erosion of civil liberties in America through interviews with U.S.
[02:07:08.329 --> 02:07:14.054]  Congressmen, former IRS Commissioner, and former IRS and FBI agents, tax attorneys, and authors.
[02:07:14.414 --> 02:07:25.182]  Russo connects the dots between money creation, one world government, and immigration, computerized voting, federal income tax, and the National Identity Card, which becomes law in May of 2008.
[02:07:26.023 --> 02:07:27.524]  Really already in place, but does become law.
[02:07:28.024 --> 02:07:32.006]  The federal ID card will use radio frequency identification technology.
[02:07:32.426 --> 02:07:37.069]  This is striking evidence of the evolving police state in America.
[02:07:37.129 --> 02:07:41.231]  The authorized final cut, even more powerful than what you saw in theaters.
[02:07:42.311 --> 02:07:44.772]  In fact, I saw it and I was like, whoa, the film was great.
[02:07:44.813 --> 02:07:45.813]  This is dynamite.
[02:07:46.513 --> 02:07:49.615]  And so crystal clear, so compelling, so powerful.
[02:07:50.735 --> 02:07:53.477]  In their own words, you need to have this.
[02:07:54.620 --> 02:07:56.961]  So many of us are deep in fighting the New World Order.
[02:07:57.001 --> 02:07:58.802]  We know all the little subtle intricacies.
[02:08:00.082 --> 02:08:04.684]  This has a lot of that, but it's also made for people who maybe see Terror Storm and can't believe it.
[02:08:05.084 --> 02:08:07.545]  Or maybe see 9-11 Mysteries Demolitions.
[02:08:07.725 --> 02:08:11.447]  Or people who see Loose Change 2nd Edition who are older and can't grasp it.
[02:08:12.047 --> 02:08:17.009]  This sucker, just across the board, I'm hearing about it everywhere, the buzz.
[02:08:18.005 --> 02:08:31.075]  I think it's going to end up eclipsing Loose Change 2nd Edition, because I saw that buzz building for a year, two years, and then going supernova, and I think that I'm seeing a bigger growth rate on America Freedom to Fascism than I saw there.
[02:08:31.756 --> 02:08:34.638]  And I saw it, I knew that was going to happen, so it's exciting.
[02:08:35.178 --> 02:08:37.820]  Of course, it may not dwarf Loose Change Final Edition.
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:40.382]  I just want to see things become bigger and bigger successes.
[02:08:40.702 --> 02:08:41.583]  I revel
[02:08:42.404 --> 02:08:43.724]  In Aaron Russo's success.
[02:08:43.924 --> 02:08:47.706]  I revel in his honesty and his dynamic nature.
[02:08:48.146 --> 02:08:51.047]  And I'm just so honored to count him a good personal friend.
[02:08:51.827 --> 02:08:57.989]  And the fact that we have got very similar views on the world and philosophies.
[02:08:58.649 --> 02:09:09.132]  And I want you, if you've seen it on Google Video, which he put it up, authorized for everybody, and you thought it was compelling and powerful, support this filmmaker.
[02:09:10.131 --> 02:09:14.953]  And you support us as well when you purchase it from Infowars.com.
[02:09:15.013 --> 02:09:26.637]  And I'm asking you, April 19th, I always think of Waco and Oklahoma City and 1776, April 15th is coming up and order it now.
[02:09:26.777 --> 02:09:27.958]  Order 3 or 4 copies.
[02:09:28.058 --> 02:09:29.218]  Order 10 if you can afford it.
[02:09:29.658 --> 02:09:29.958]  Order 100!
[02:09:30.018 --> 02:09:35.020]  And we've got bulk discounts if you want that.
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.121]  Get it out to people.
[02:09:37.887 --> 02:09:41.549]  You know, Aaron hasn't even made his money back on over a million dollars in advertising.
[02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:43.150]  Very expensive to put it in theaters.
[02:09:44.351 --> 02:09:49.353]  He was fighting and in very bad health when it got distributed.
[02:09:49.694 --> 02:09:50.814]  I don't want to get into the back side.
[02:09:50.834 --> 02:09:53.696]  He doesn't like to whine, but there was sabotage, clearly.
[02:09:54.749 --> 02:10:01.612]  So he hasn't even begun to get his money back on this, and Aaron, you need to support him.
[02:10:01.652 --> 02:10:07.755]  You need to go to InfoWars.com right now, and you need to order as many of these as you can afford.
[02:10:07.775 --> 02:10:10.095]  And you go, oh, but I want to make copies.
[02:10:10.216 --> 02:10:13.637]  I tell you that with mine, he says do it, but the point is, he needs your support.
[02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:14.860]  Okay?
[02:10:15.601 --> 02:10:17.042]  And I need your support.
[02:10:17.082 --> 02:10:19.064]  And we need to get this film out to the people.
[02:10:19.324 --> 02:10:26.030]  There's nothing like it in the big, pretty, professionally designed, color, you know, hard case, with the DVD, with the color cover.
[02:10:26.430 --> 02:10:27.511]  Give it as a gift.
[02:10:28.272 --> 02:10:30.453]  Give it to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[02:10:31.594 --> 02:10:33.276]  Get one for yourself on the shelf.
[02:10:33.951 --> 02:10:43.718]  This is an important document about our nation, and about the world, and about who we face, and this thing is really kicking off the revolution.
[02:10:44.239 --> 02:10:49.983]  I mean, so much is built up to this, but I see this as a seminal work.
[02:10:51.064 --> 02:10:52.485]  I mean, this is a grand slam.
[02:10:52.525 --> 02:10:53.786]  This is a royal flush.
[02:10:54.186 --> 02:10:56.048]  This is out of the park times ten.
[02:10:57.088 --> 02:10:59.810]  This thing is so valuable.
[02:11:00.471 --> 02:11:01.672]  I don't want you to wait.
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:05.242]  You know, I rarely talk like this, and I think I never talk like this.
[02:11:05.342 --> 02:11:11.005]  You need to call the toll-free number right now, even if you already have a copy, and order more.
[02:11:11.025 --> 02:11:11.625]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:11:11.645 --> 02:11:14.647]  888-253-3139, or order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[02:11:25.362 --> 02:11:38.413]  at Infowars.com or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:11:39.374 --> 02:11:46.540]  And when he was on with us a month ago, tough guys, you know, just vetting up and coming on the air.
[02:11:46.780 --> 02:11:49.823]  Gone through a lot, believe me, and I know you want me to talk about it, so I'm not going to.
[02:11:50.652 --> 02:12:12.419]  You know, he said, and I said, we need you to, from now and in the next few months to April 15th, set up every weekend on a Saturday or a Sunday or a Wednesday night, have four or five of your friends over, have a whole block party over, tell people, you know, free spaghetti and pizza or you got the barbecue pit out, get your neighbors over and say, I want you to see this and don't act like it's all creepy and weird and this is scary.
[02:12:12.679 --> 02:12:14.259]  That's not how you do it to win people over.
[02:12:14.279 --> 02:12:15.600]  You go, hey man, you need to see this.
[02:12:15.620 --> 02:12:16.560]  This is the revolution.
[02:12:17.196 --> 02:12:28.584]  Pop America Freedom to Fascism in, and you can get it for $19.95 from Infowars.com, and when you do, we encourage you to get it, $9.95, half price on TerrorStorm.
[02:12:29.345 --> 02:12:32.567]  Two hour film, 16 minutes of extras, the history of government sponsored terror.
[02:12:32.967 --> 02:12:36.790]  This is the other side of the story, how they're terrorizing us to keep us under their system.
[02:12:37.779 --> 02:12:44.704]  Get America Freedom to Fascism right now, do not wait, and support this filmmaker and support what we're doing here as well.
[02:12:45.104 --> 02:13:04.717]  Aaron, I kept you on hold there while I put that plug, the longest and biggest plug I ever did, it's because I'm seeing something very special with your film right now, and I think a year from now it's going to be 50 times bigger than it is right now, and it's already blockbuster huge in the alternative media and breaking into the general culture.
[02:13:05.018 --> 02:13:06.879]  Aaron Russo, what do you say to that?
[02:13:07.905 --> 02:13:09.526]  First of all, I want to say thank you, Alex.
[02:13:09.906 --> 02:13:11.187]  I'm glad to be on your show.
[02:13:11.727 --> 02:13:12.607]  I'm glad to be here.
[02:13:12.627 --> 02:13:13.748]  I'm glad to be alive.
[02:13:13.768 --> 02:13:25.174]  You know, I've been fighting big battles for my health, and I honor you and respect you and thank you for everything you're doing and the cause that we both so deeply believe in.
[02:13:25.294 --> 02:13:29.956]  That's of the utmost importance to me, knowing that there are people out there besides myself
[02:13:30.732 --> 02:13:34.075]  I believe as deeply as I do what we have to do to win this country back.
[02:13:34.275 --> 02:13:40.680]  And you've been a true patriot and a true hero and I certainly appreciate everything you're doing.
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:45.163]  I appreciate your discussing my film in the glowing terms you discuss it.
[02:13:45.183 --> 02:13:46.644]  It means a lot to me.
[02:13:47.525 --> 02:13:49.266]  But I'm only saying it because it's the truth.
[02:13:49.546 --> 02:13:50.887]  Oh, I understand that.
[02:13:51.087 --> 02:13:52.608]  And you know the wild buzz.
[02:13:53.169 --> 02:13:53.789]  I understand.
[02:13:53.809 --> 02:13:59.654]  We went to number four on Google yesterday, or today, by the way, which is huge.
[02:14:00.745 --> 02:14:04.608]  Somehow the world is just spreading and spreading and spreading all over the place.
[02:14:05.508 --> 02:14:08.990]  And the movie is taking on a life of its own.
[02:14:09.010 --> 02:14:11.272]  It's spreading across the country like wildfire.
[02:14:11.312 --> 02:14:19.997]  People are learning the truth about the income tax, about the Federal Reserve, about the New World Order, and ways to stop it, what the solutions are.
[02:14:20.637 --> 02:14:22.698]  And so I'm very, very gratified.
[02:14:22.738 --> 02:14:25.520]  I mean, I've made big movies, you know, like Trading Places.
[02:14:25.936 --> 02:14:31.699]  With Eddie Murphy and The Rose, with Bette Midler, and I've done All It Teaches with Nick Nolte, I've done all those things.
[02:14:32.299 --> 02:14:35.300]  But truly, for me, this is the most important work I've ever done.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:38.001]  It means more to me than anything else I've ever done.
[02:14:38.021 --> 02:14:45.545]  All my years of managing Bette Midler or Manhattan, all the success I've had in my life, this movie is the epitome for me.
[02:14:46.392 --> 02:14:51.454]  And I can just thank God and the Lord that the people are receiving it the way they are.
[02:14:51.474 --> 02:14:59.757]  And I certainly hope that everybody listening to the show will spread the word and get a copy and tell all their friends about it and just keep
[02:15:00.367 --> 02:15:03.328]  Keep the word going as to what's really happening in this country.
[02:15:03.348 --> 02:15:06.608]  Well, they pulled the stops out, and I know you're the winner type.
[02:15:06.648 --> 02:15:11.950]  You don't like to talk about it because you're already moved past it, but behind the scenes, I know you don't want to get into it.
[02:15:12.190 --> 02:15:14.190]  You have gone through incredible sabotage.
[02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:15.470]  But it didn't work, did it?
[02:15:16.271 --> 02:15:17.491]  No, nothing's going to stop me.
[02:15:17.531 --> 02:15:18.031]  You know that.
[02:15:18.151 --> 02:15:19.591]  I mean, until death comes.
[02:15:20.392 --> 02:15:23.272]  And I don't expect to die shortly.
[02:15:24.012 --> 02:15:25.873]  I've been fighting a battle with cancer.
[02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:28.550]  This is my fourth time.
[02:15:29.091 --> 02:15:34.052]  Last Friday we got the whole listening audience to pray for you and I guarantee you millions prayed for you.
[02:15:34.472 --> 02:15:37.273]  Well, it's working because I'm feeling very, very good.
[02:15:37.313 --> 02:15:38.473]  I feel very strong.
[02:15:39.153 --> 02:15:42.534]  I got some great news about the cancer.
[02:15:43.455 --> 02:15:48.356]  As I said before, you know, I don't want to curse it, but... Yeah, the big one has suddenly turned to jelly.
[02:15:49.016 --> 02:15:55.178]  Well, three times in the past I thought the cancer was gone, but we just got rid of the tumors and then got rid of the cancer.
[02:15:55.732 --> 02:16:15.258]  And I've taken a different approach to defeating it this time, and it appears it's not done by any stretch, and I'm not counting my chickens before they hatch, but I have a number of tumors in my body, but the big tumor that's attached to my bladder, the middle of it is
[02:16:16.584 --> 02:16:22.908]  It's like a tear necrotic, which means that it's like a donut, in the middle of it's starting to die from the medicines I'm taking.
[02:16:23.188 --> 02:16:28.311]  And so, we're very hopeful that what's happening there will happen throughout the rest of the term.
[02:16:28.331 --> 02:16:32.973]  And let's be clear, you're not taking chemo, you're taking... No, I don't do chemo, I don't do radiation.
[02:16:32.993 --> 02:16:39.257]  I work with Dr. Stan Laspaczynski out of Houston, Texas, and he has his own methods.
[02:16:39.277 --> 02:16:42.539]  And I work with him, and it's working very well for me right at the moment.
[02:16:43.440 --> 02:16:45.241]  And I'm very pleased about it.
[02:16:45.641 --> 02:16:47.482]  And I feel strong.
[02:16:47.542 --> 02:16:49.022]  I feel like I'm going to win this battle.
[02:16:49.602 --> 02:16:55.244]  I mean, when I say I feel strong, I don't feel like I felt when I was 100% healthy, but I feel strong.
[02:16:55.284 --> 02:16:56.465]  You know, I feel okay.
[02:16:57.185 --> 02:17:03.307]  And if I don't exert myself too much, I can have these phone calls and do these interviews and do the things I want to do.
[02:17:03.327 --> 02:17:07.669]  But I expect in a little bit of time, I'll be able to go out and start making movies again.
[02:17:07.749 --> 02:17:11.350]  I'm working on a new story for a new movie now.
[02:17:12.285 --> 02:17:14.106]  And I'm very, very excited about.
[02:17:15.326 --> 02:17:18.087]  And it sort of parallels what's happening in America today.
[02:17:18.187 --> 02:17:20.468]  But this is not a documentary.
[02:17:20.508 --> 02:17:21.808]  This is a fictional movie.
[02:17:21.988 --> 02:17:22.788]  Stay there, Aaron.
[02:17:22.808 --> 02:17:23.629]  We've got a break.
[02:17:23.649 --> 02:17:24.649]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:25.229 --> 02:17:27.570]  We'll talk about Ron Paul for president and a lot more.

[02:18:40.129 --> 02:18:42.050]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:18:42.550 --> 02:18:43.410]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:43.450 --> 02:18:44.050]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:18:44.090 --> 02:18:44.430]  A 5% increase.
[02:18:51.365 --> 02:18:57.286]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[02:18:57.406 --> 02:19:00.607]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:19:01.387 --> 02:19:03.728]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:19:03.748 --> 02:19:06.988]  A 16% increase in real money.

[02:19:35.830 --> 02:19:40.914]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[02:19:41.775 --> 02:19:45.718]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[02:19:46.318 --> 02:19:54.665]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?

[02:21:56.963 --> 02:21:57.804]  Welcome back.

[02:22:02.766 --> 02:22:03.987]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:22:04.287 --> 02:22:07.008]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:19.292 --> 02:22:22.174]  Don't forget we have a free podcast every day when the three hours ends.
[02:22:22.835 --> 02:22:24.436]  You just sign up for it for free.
[02:22:24.476 --> 02:22:30.060]  Just click on the subscribe and it sends it to you for free each day to your iPod or MP3 player device.
[02:22:31.741 --> 02:22:33.602]  We've got a big event coming up tomorrow.
[02:22:33.622 --> 02:22:40.287]  I'll tell you about before the show ends at the UT Student Union with George Humphreys, Jack Blood, myself.
[02:22:41.468 --> 02:22:42.689]  They just had me coming out to speak.
[02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:43.720]  We're good to go.
[02:23:09.855 --> 02:23:14.578]  But you just said to go get the word out, to go to New Hampshire, to have a last stand, to try to get the word out.
[02:23:14.598 --> 02:23:18.080]  And Ron Paul, of course you immediately got behind him before I even talked to you.
[02:23:18.140 --> 02:23:19.842]  I immediately got behind him a few weeks ago.
[02:23:20.782 --> 02:23:26.526]  And he's anti-war, he's anti-New World Order, he's pro-Second Amendment, he's for our sovereignty.
[02:23:26.546 --> 02:23:28.187]  I mean, he is a statesman.
[02:23:28.207 --> 02:23:36.953]  Ron Paul is the only man that I can endorse for the presidency of the United States.
[02:23:37.393 --> 02:23:38.674]  There's no one else running.
[02:23:39.127 --> 02:23:41.247]  They can get my full and complete support.
[02:23:41.708 --> 02:23:50.089]  I mean, the truth was that before I came down with this cancer, I was thinking about doing it myself because I didn't know where else to turn.
[02:23:50.109 --> 02:23:54.190]  You know, not that I wanted to do it, but I felt the country really needed it.
[02:23:55.030 --> 02:24:02.472]  But once Ron Paul announced and said he was going to do it, I dropped my own thinking about it and immediately told my whole organization.
[02:24:02.492 --> 02:24:07.353]  I sent out a letter to all my email people and said, I am backing Ron Paul 100%.
[02:24:08.780 --> 02:24:32.414]  I expect, you know, I hope and expect that everybody in my organization will support Ron Paul and we want to interface with his organization because the whole idea is to go up to New Hampshire and to Iowa and to make a really strong showing to win or come in second in those states and all of a sudden Ron Paul will be on everybody's lips across America and if the whole freedom movement
[02:24:33.055 --> 02:24:42.078]  Can get behind Ron Paul and not get divided between the Constitution Party and the Libertarian Party and the Reform Party and all the other parties.
[02:24:42.478 --> 02:24:49.159]  And everybody puts their effort behind one man, Ron Paul, who is far and away the best candidate we can put out there.
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:54.621]  And we start sending trailers up to New Hampshire and we have volunteers on the streets.
[02:24:54.969 --> 02:24:59.111]  We can turn this country around, because Ron Paul can win in New Hampshire.
[02:24:59.451 --> 02:25:24.280]  If the whole Freedom Movement actually does their job, and stops just talking about it, and starts taking action, and we all get to New Hampshire and volunteer, and hand out the DVDs to the people, the Freedom to Fascism DVDs to the people in New Hampshire, where Ron Paul is featured on that DVD, and they get to see who this man is, and we have offices up there, and we're handing out DVDs and flyers and pamphlets,
[02:25:24.921 --> 02:25:28.463]  The truth is, there's no strong Republican running.
[02:25:28.843 --> 02:25:33.004]  I don't care about Rudy Giuliani, or McCain, or Mitt Romney.
[02:25:33.064 --> 02:25:34.365]  Or even Tom Tancredo.
[02:25:34.385 --> 02:25:35.565]  He's nothing compared to Paul.
[02:25:35.926 --> 02:25:37.306]  Nothing compared to Paul.
[02:25:37.406 --> 02:25:39.727]  Ron Paul dwarfs Tom Tancredo.
[02:25:40.127 --> 02:25:44.129]  And Tom Tancredo's best issue is immigration.
[02:25:44.844 --> 02:25:48.988]  And Ron Paul is just as strong on it as he is, but yet strong on all the other issues.
[02:26:05.718 --> 02:26:07.259]  He's saying he's going to do it.
[02:26:07.660 --> 02:26:09.301]  There is no excuse.
[02:26:09.361 --> 02:26:10.242]  He's a doctor.
[02:26:10.542 --> 02:26:11.763]  He's a Vietnam veteran.
[02:26:11.783 --> 02:26:15.286]  He has a constitutionalist voting record.
[02:26:15.606 --> 02:26:17.127]  He's good on every issue.
[02:26:17.568 --> 02:26:22.152]  And they rewrote his district, the Republicans did, Tom DeLay, openly trying to defeat him.
[02:26:22.432 --> 02:26:28.617]  And in a super-liberal district, he won by 65%, as big as he won last time in a conservative district.
[02:26:29.077 --> 02:26:30.338]  And here's the kicker.
[02:26:30.838 --> 02:26:33.380]  CNN has listed the six Republican candidates.
[02:26:33.841 --> 02:26:35.502]  They will not list Ron Paul.
[02:26:35.562 --> 02:26:36.983]  They will not talk about it.
[02:26:37.303 --> 02:26:39.024]  They will not discuss him.
[02:26:39.064 --> 02:26:40.466]  He's a serious candidate.
[02:26:40.786 --> 02:26:43.248]  And it's because they're scared to death of him.
[02:26:43.548 --> 02:26:45.950]  So that's an indicator right there that they know he can win.
[02:26:46.290 --> 02:26:49.652]  They wouldn't discuss... The same way they wouldn't talk about me or my movie.
[02:26:49.952 --> 02:26:52.514]  My movie didn't get one review on national television.
[02:26:52.774 --> 02:26:53.035]  Okay?
[02:26:53.275 --> 02:26:56.177]  Here I have Academy Award nominations, Emmys, and Tonys.
[02:26:56.536 --> 02:26:58.237]  Not one review on national television.
[02:26:58.477 --> 02:27:00.118]  The same thing they're going to do to Ron Paul.
[02:27:00.378 --> 02:27:05.761]  Because anybody who believes in the Constitution and understands constitutional government, they're not going to support.
[02:27:06.202 --> 02:27:06.362]  Alright?
[02:27:06.422 --> 02:27:07.543]  That's why it's up to us.
[02:27:08.703 --> 02:27:10.104]  We can turn it around.
[02:27:10.384 --> 02:27:18.329]  The beauty of this is that we have enough people in America, enough patriots and freedom-loving people, that we can go to New Hampshire.
[02:27:18.389 --> 02:27:19.229]  We can do it!
[02:27:19.269 --> 02:27:19.910]  We got a break!
[02:27:19.930 --> 02:27:20.930]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:22.111 --> 02:27:23.052]  We're on the march.
[02:27:23.492 --> 02:27:25.013]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:26.028 --> 02:27:28.772]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:31.955 --> 02:27:33.657]  Shelley, you look ex... Oh, wait!
[02:27:33.797 --> 02:27:34.899]  Why did you turn that down?
[02:27:34.919 --> 02:27:37.462]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:27:37.827 --> 02:27:42.490]  Well, I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:45.092]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:27:45.352 --> 02:27:46.553]  I can do something like that.
[02:27:46.573 --> 02:27:51.997]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night, and you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:27:52.057 --> 02:27:53.859]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:27:53.979 --> 02:27:56.240]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:57.241]  I guess you're right.
[02:27:57.621 --> 02:27:58.302]  Why don't we try it?
[02:27:58.482 --> 02:28:00.463]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:28:00.904 --> 02:28:05.287]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer, and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:28:05.567 --> 02:28:06.908]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:28:07.349 --> 02:28:11.652]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:28:11.913 --> 02:28:15.195]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[02:28:18.958 --> 02:28:19.839]  Are you a hot sleeper?
[02:28:20.059 --> 02:28:21.340]  Is your partner a hot sleeper?
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:22.821]  The BedFan is the answer.

[02:28:29.586 --> 02:28:31.828]  That's bed, F-A-N, dot com.
[02:28:32.432 --> 02:28:32.972]  It's a fact.
[02:28:33.153 --> 02:28:37.597]  You can legally eliminate credit card debt, which has been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:28:38.037 --> 02:28:43.242]  Since its creation in 1913, the Federal Reserve has not been held responsible for its own debt.
[02:28:43.522 --> 02:28:46.725]  So why should you, the hard-working American, be harassed for yours?
[02:28:46.985 --> 02:28:54.092]  There's a double standard when it comes to being responsible for debt, and unlike the Federal Reserve, the people of this country can't print more money when needed.
[02:28:54.452 --> 02:29:01.660]  Day of Jubilee has created a successful program designed for people that want to stop harassing calls and threatening letters from bill collectors.
[02:29:02.080 --> 02:29:03.922]  We also do credit restoration.
[02:29:04.383 --> 02:29:09.548]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated
[02:29:09.548 --> 02:29:09.888]  I think so.
[02:29:32.237 --> 02:29:34.599]  Attention, attention everyone!
[02:29:34.619 --> 02:29:37.181]  A brand new invention just released.
[02:29:37.241 --> 02:29:41.945]  It's called Wristease, the new patented portable ergonomic wrist support.
[02:29:42.606 --> 02:29:49.427]  Wristease comforts your wrists from the sometimes painful tasks of typing, writing, using a mouse or adding machine.
[02:29:49.967 --> 02:30:02.829]  Unlike most conventional wrist pads that are either attached to a mouse pad or lay flat in front of your keyboard, Wristease is totally portable and ideal for laptop users and technicians who are constantly on the go.
[02:30:03.290 --> 02:30:07.270]  Wristease is perfect for children doing homework or playing video games.
[02:30:07.730 --> 02:30:11.711]  Wristease provides the proper comfort and support for all ages and
[02:30:12.291 --> 02:30:17.815]  Wristease provides comfort for victims of carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive injuries.
[02:30:18.195 --> 02:30:21.217]  You can order Wristease now at Wristease.com.
[02:30:21.597 --> 02:30:22.818]  That's Wristease.

[02:30:28.361 --> 02:30:30.983]  Once again, Wristease.com.
[02:30:40.565 --> 02:30:44.630]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio.
[02:30:47.781 --> 02:30:52.785]  George Strait was singin' the seashores of old Mexico.
[02:30:54.126 --> 02:30:58.409]  It sounded so good, I got an idea.
[02:30:58.449 --> 02:31:02.452]  I'm gonna go there since they're all over here.
[02:31:02.812 --> 02:31:07.115]  The Lonestar State should be renamed Texico.
[02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:36.715]  So long Texas, hello Mexico I'm gonna swim the Rio Grande at El Paso I'm leaving tonight, I ain't gonna pack I'm only taking the clothes on my back So long Texas, hello Mexico
[02:31:43.434 --> 02:31:51.942]  I'll drive a rattle-trap car with no liability.
[02:31:53.223 --> 02:31:59.509]  I'll demand equal rights, though I'm there illegally.
[02:32:02.405 --> 02:32:06.628]  I'll protest in the streets till they finally grant them.
[02:32:06.688 --> 02:32:09.810]  Sing English words to their national anthem.
[02:32:10.150 --> 02:32:11.571]  Hey, Vincente!
[02:32:11.791 --> 02:32:17.895]  What's right for your people should be right for me.
[02:32:17.935 --> 02:32:23.099]  There's no controlling that tide that keeps rolling across the line.
[02:32:24.780 --> 02:32:30.824]  This old Texas cowboy feels like my home state's no longer mine.
[02:32:44.606 --> 02:32:45.267]  Welcome back!
[02:32:45.967 --> 02:32:49.129]  Aaron Russo is our guest, Derek, Steve, Jeff, Joseph, others.
[02:32:49.749 --> 02:32:58.874]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes for Aaron Russo, the director, the producer of America Freedom to Fascism, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:32:58.894 --> 02:33:00.835]  Aaron, continuing,
[02:33:01.625 --> 02:33:10.812]  When I talked to you a few weeks ago, you said it was very suspicious, and you've been involved in politics a while, and I think it is too, what Tom Tancredo, how he announced, when he announced.
[02:33:12.953 --> 02:33:13.834]  You want to comment on that?
[02:33:14.234 --> 02:33:16.276]  Well, I mean, I don't have any hard facts.
[02:33:16.356 --> 02:33:23.361]  I just know that I thought it was odd that Ron Paul announced, and then Tom Tancredo, who was going to run as a Constitution Party member, I was told.
[02:33:23.914 --> 02:33:28.758]  And now that he's running as Republican, that wouldn't surprise me to take votes away from Ron Paul.
[02:33:29.218 --> 02:33:30.179]  Look, here's the point.
[02:33:30.559 --> 02:33:32.261]  I don't want to talk about Tom Sancredo.
[02:33:32.641 --> 02:33:39.846]  I want to talk about Ron Paul and the fact that the American people, the freedom people of America, can take the bull by the horns right now.
[02:33:40.207 --> 02:33:42.969]  We have the ability to put Ron Paul into office.
[02:33:43.449 --> 02:33:50.234]  Because we can go into New Hampshire, it's a small state, and we have enough people in the freedom movement to make a difference in New Hampshire.
[02:33:50.555 --> 02:33:53.497]  If we win New Hampshire with Ron Paul, and we back him,
[02:33:53.823 --> 02:33:55.444]  And we really got our butts out there.
[02:33:56.305 --> 02:33:59.147]  It's going to send a shock throughout the whole country.
[02:33:59.428 --> 02:34:00.488]  And nobody can ignore it.
[02:34:00.548 --> 02:34:04.732]  They can't ignore Ron Paul once he comes in first or second in New Hampshire.
[02:34:05.032 --> 02:34:15.601]  And we have enough people in this freedom movement, if they get busy and they make contributions to his campaign, you know, and they get out to New Hampshire and start volunteering and start handing out DVDs
[02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:24.035]  The people of Freedom From Fascism, the DVDs, with Ron Paul in the DVD, and people learn what's happening in America and New Hampshire.
[02:34:24.335 --> 02:34:27.221]  We can win New Hampshire, because it's a small state.
[02:34:27.839 --> 02:34:28.199]  I think?
[02:34:47.273 --> 02:34:48.554]  To take it on now.
[02:34:48.834 --> 02:34:50.276]  He's put himself on the line.
[02:34:50.596 --> 02:34:52.257]  As I was going to if he didn't do it.
[02:34:52.617 --> 02:35:00.524]  He's put himself on the line and it's up to us to show him the respect and support him and to try and take America back and to win this republic.
[02:35:00.824 --> 02:35:04.587]  It's time to restore the American Republic to what it's supposed to be.
[02:35:04.907 --> 02:35:07.629]  I'm sick and tired of what's happening to this country.
[02:35:08.070 --> 02:35:09.451]  And it's time to take it back.
[02:35:09.931 --> 02:35:13.434]  And we have to do everything we can do in our power to do that.
[02:35:13.774 --> 02:35:15.596]  And everybody out there has to take part.
[02:35:16.061 --> 02:35:16.861]  Don't sit back.
[02:35:17.242 --> 02:35:17.882]  Take part.
[02:35:18.282 --> 02:35:20.603]  Get online, make donations to his campaign.
[02:35:20.943 --> 02:35:22.644]  Go up to New Hampshire and volunteer.
[02:35:23.044 --> 02:35:26.846]  Go to his campaign offices and tell them you want to volunteer.
[02:35:27.186 --> 02:35:28.146]  Let's organize.
[02:35:28.386 --> 02:35:30.487]  Let's all galvanize behind Ron Paul.
[02:35:30.828 --> 02:35:32.428]  Not behind the Libertarian Party.
[02:35:32.768 --> 02:35:34.569]  Not behind the Constitution Party.
[02:35:34.869 --> 02:35:36.370]  Not behind the Reform Party.
[02:35:36.901 --> 02:35:43.682]  But behind the man who can win, as a Republican, who's going to get attention if he wins New Hampshire, or comes in second.
[02:35:43.982 --> 02:35:46.143]  And we have the ability to do that.
[02:35:46.223 --> 02:35:50.504]  By the way, when I talked to you, Aaron, you were going to run as a Republican, and you had a reason for that.
[02:35:51.084 --> 02:36:01.086]  Yeah, I was going to run as a Republican because they can ignore the Constitution Party, they can ignore the Libertarian Party, they can ignore the Reform Party, but the media can't ignore the Republican Party.
[02:36:01.446 --> 02:36:05.147]  And whoever runs as a Republican, the Republican Party can be taken over.
[02:36:05.267 --> 02:36:05.747]  It's weak.
[02:36:06.414 --> 02:36:12.097]  And if Ron Paul wins in New Hampshire, it'll be press all over the world.
[02:36:12.137 --> 02:36:23.582]  By the way, you started the Constitution Party, and let's tell them right now, anybody in the Constitution Party that feels another candidate against Ron Paul, I'm done with that party in the future.
[02:36:23.622 --> 02:36:28.285]  And anybody, the Libertarians, don't support Ron Paul, you've made a major enemy.
[02:36:28.525 --> 02:36:29.525]  What do you say to that, Aaron?
[02:36:29.905 --> 02:36:30.766]  I agree with that.
[02:36:30.806 --> 02:36:33.327]  I think it's time to put apart party politics.
[02:36:33.717 --> 02:36:34.497]  Put them aside.
[02:36:34.518 --> 02:36:42.242]  It's time to back the man who stands for the principles of freedom, and to restore the Republic to what it's supposed to be.
[02:36:42.502 --> 02:36:43.763]  I don't care about parties.
[02:36:43.823 --> 02:36:53.989]  And I'm going to tell the Democrats out there, Ron Paul's against this war, and you better support him instead of your bloodthirsty, war hawk Democrat, she-devil, Hillary!
[02:36:54.650 --> 02:36:55.270]  Exactly.
[02:36:55.290 --> 02:36:58.652]  I mean, Hillary's just bought and paid for by the Rockefeller family.
[02:36:58.872 --> 02:37:00.513]  He's a banshee.
[02:37:00.813 --> 02:37:01.794]  You know, the whole thing,
[02:37:02.753 --> 02:37:04.634]  We've got to take the country back.
[02:37:05.234 --> 02:37:16.259]  And the thing that's so beautiful, and the reason I was going to run, was because we can take over... Look, when I ran for governor in Nevada, I took over the Republican Party in Nevada.
[02:37:16.379 --> 02:37:17.460]  I was able to do that.
[02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:19.961]  And you got, what, 37% of the vote?
[02:37:20.221 --> 02:37:21.521]  Yeah, a little less than 30%.
[02:37:21.601 --> 02:37:23.102]  It wasn't even that.
[02:37:23.422 --> 02:37:25.403]  I took over the inner workings of the party.
[02:37:25.882 --> 02:37:31.383]  I actually took over the control of the Central Committee, the Las Vegas Party.
[02:37:31.683 --> 02:37:33.104]  We had control of the party!
[02:37:33.764 --> 02:37:34.164]  Okay?
[02:37:34.644 --> 02:37:37.965]  And the fact is, is that we can take over the Republican Party.
[02:37:38.025 --> 02:37:45.506]  If Ron Paul goes to New Hampshire and comes in first or second, it's going to be a shot heard around the world.
[02:37:45.906 --> 02:37:50.087]  And the truth is, there's enough people in the Freedom Movement that can make that happen.
[02:37:50.467 --> 02:37:54.388]  We go to New Hampshire and Iowa, and Ron Paul does well in those two places,
[02:37:55.474 --> 02:37:57.815]  Because, you know, it's going to be an explosion.
[02:37:57.855 --> 02:38:00.675]  Well, we need to fight to win and believe we can win, and we can win.
[02:38:00.815 --> 02:38:10.698]  But, even if he doesn't win, if he gets into the Republican debates, that will energize the debate and inject real issues.
[02:38:11.158 --> 02:38:18.000]  And the fact is, if he comes in first or second, and he's going to be in the debates, they can't keep him out at that point.
[02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:19.260]  It's too public.
[02:38:20.051 --> 02:38:21.952]  They can keep the Libertarian Party out.
[02:38:22.212 --> 02:38:23.693]  They can keep the Constitution Party out.
[02:38:23.913 --> 02:38:25.855]  They can't keep the Republican Party out.
[02:38:26.655 --> 02:38:27.175]  That's the plan.
[02:38:27.215 --> 02:38:30.718]  We have a congressman who's running who believes in everything we believe in.
[02:38:31.538 --> 02:38:32.779]  You've got to back the guy.
[02:38:33.099 --> 02:38:34.500]  Hell with the Constitution Party.
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:35.961]  I started that party.
[02:38:35.981 --> 02:38:38.042]  You know, give it up.
[02:38:38.522 --> 02:38:39.843]  Go with Ron Paul.
[02:38:40.484 --> 02:38:41.704]  I ran as a Libertarian.
[02:38:42.005 --> 02:38:42.505]  Give it up.
[02:38:42.865 --> 02:38:44.066]  Back Ron Paul.
[02:38:44.781 --> 02:38:45.742]  That's what it's about.
[02:38:45.762 --> 02:38:47.322]  It's about backing the man.
[02:38:47.722 --> 02:38:51.384]  We have a situation now, and we can make a difference.
[02:38:51.924 --> 02:38:53.925]  And the strategy is so important.
[02:38:54.306 --> 02:38:55.906]  You know, strategy is everything.
[02:38:56.307 --> 02:38:57.587]  And timing is everything.
[02:38:57.887 --> 02:38:59.188]  We have our opportunity.
[02:38:59.628 --> 02:39:02.009]  And I just thank God that I'm not the one who has to run.
[02:39:02.610 --> 02:39:06.071]  As you know, I was talking to you about you running as VP with me.
[02:39:06.091 --> 02:39:09.493]  Because I was preparing to run because we had to do something.
[02:39:10.188 --> 02:39:12.349]  You know, but Ron Paul's a better choice than I am.
[02:39:12.529 --> 02:39:13.129]  Absolutely.
[02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:14.630]  You know, so let's go for it.
[02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:16.431]  Let everybody out there just go for it.
[02:39:16.531 --> 02:39:20.553]  Well, plus, you were going, yeah, I've got these new big movie deals, but I guess I won't do them.
[02:39:20.593 --> 02:39:22.473]  I'll run for president even with cancer.
[02:39:23.174 --> 02:39:28.776]  And now you're glad that, you know, bigger, more powerful... I didn't know I had the cancer when I was going to run.
[02:39:28.836 --> 02:39:30.517]  I didn't know I had the cancer at that point.
[02:39:30.537 --> 02:39:31.697]  Well, I'm talking about a month ago.
[02:39:31.717 --> 02:39:32.938]  You were going, I'm still going to run.
[02:39:32.998 --> 02:39:34.879]  I'm going to remember those discussions.
[02:39:34.939 --> 02:39:38.380]  Once Ron Paul announced, that was it.
[02:39:38.460 --> 02:39:39.121]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:39:40.171 --> 02:39:44.133]  You know, it's very, very clear what we have to do, what the Freedom Movement has to do.
[02:39:44.213 --> 02:39:45.234]  It has to galvanize.
[02:39:45.614 --> 02:39:47.135]  It can't be at odds with each other.
[02:39:47.475 --> 02:39:52.118]  Anybody who says, don't vote for Ron Paul, vote for someone else, they're not part of the Freedom Movement.
[02:39:52.358 --> 02:39:53.399]  They're disinformation.
[02:39:54.219 --> 02:39:56.240]  You know, we have our opportunity right now.
[02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:57.401]  We have our best choice.
[02:39:57.961 --> 02:39:58.742]  Get behind it.
[02:39:59.162 --> 02:40:02.063]  Don't be set aside by all the nonsense.
[02:40:02.704 --> 02:40:03.224]  Go for it.
[02:40:03.584 --> 02:40:04.085]  Absolutely.
[02:40:04.125 --> 02:40:05.365]  Let's go to some phone calls.
[02:40:05.746 --> 02:40:08.127]  Derek in Texas, you're on the air with Aaron Russo.
[02:40:09.279 --> 02:40:10.820]  Hey Aaron, God bless you, sir.
[02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:12.021]  Thank you, Derek.
[02:40:12.061 --> 02:40:12.701]  Thank you, buddy.
[02:40:12.741 --> 02:40:13.301]  How you doing?
[02:40:13.841 --> 02:40:14.122]  Fine.
[02:40:14.162 --> 02:40:18.624]  Me and my family and I encourage all of Alex's audience to pray to God for your life.
[02:40:19.404 --> 02:40:20.265]  Oh, you're so sweet.
[02:40:20.305 --> 02:40:21.065]  Thank you very much.
[02:40:21.105 --> 02:40:23.026]  Well, I guess the prayers are working.
[02:40:23.246 --> 02:40:24.106]  Please don't stop.
[02:40:25.007 --> 02:40:26.968]  You know, because it seems to be working for me.
[02:40:27.028 --> 02:40:28.108]  I'm feeling really good.
[02:40:28.148 --> 02:40:30.870]  I'm feeling strong and I'm going to beat this thing.
[02:40:30.910 --> 02:40:32.671]  I'm going to beat this and I'm going to win.
[02:40:33.371 --> 02:40:35.272]  And all your prayers are so helpful to me.
[02:40:35.936 --> 02:40:40.280]  And knowing that everybody's doing that, that people love me for that, I can't tell you what it means to me.
[02:40:40.680 --> 02:40:42.322]  And God bless you, thank you so much.
[02:40:43.563 --> 02:40:45.324]  Uh, three things I would like to bring up.
[02:40:45.544 --> 02:40:50.669]  Uh, one is David Rivera's book, uh, The New World Order, Final Warning, A History of the New World Order.
[02:40:50.689 --> 02:40:51.710]  Are you familiar with that work?
[02:40:52.230 --> 02:40:53.551]  No, I've not read the book, no, sir.
[02:40:53.651 --> 02:40:54.192]  I've heard of it.
[02:40:55.175 --> 02:40:57.738]  It's a tremendously powerful weapon to help our cause.
[02:40:58.438 --> 02:41:09.229]  The second is that the United Nations bought and paid for the hockey-fit graft that everyone's justifying global warming with in 1998, and it's Rockefeller-funded, and that's something that people need to be reminded of.
[02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:11.051]  The oil companies are behind big oil.
[02:41:11.091 --> 02:41:12.812]  Gregg Pallas, the Liberals, told you that.
[02:41:12.853 --> 02:41:14.114]  BBC got the documents.
[02:41:15.094 --> 02:41:41.724]  They are, the sun's heating up, that's causing climate change, that's the actual scientific readings, and we have now, actually have it here, Freedom of Information Act request from the North American Summit, secret meeting in Canada last year, this is on Judicial Watch's own website, and it says, North American activists plotted stealth strategy, the tales of secret meeting released as part of a FOIA request, and they say they're going to use the phony global warming to push the North American Union.
[02:41:42.604 --> 02:41:42.824]  Right.
[02:41:43.479 --> 02:41:48.742]  Third and final weapon that we can use is finite element analysis software to debunk 9-11.
[02:41:49.142 --> 02:41:54.045]  Both the World Trade Center towers, I've done this myself, I'm an engineer, and I did this work as an undergrad.
[02:41:54.406 --> 02:41:58.428]  We can also do the same thing to the Pentagon to prove that what happened did not happen.
[02:41:58.848 --> 02:42:05.692]  All it takes is an accurate model, reasonable load conditions, and it can be proven that the pancake theory cannot happen on these buildings.
[02:42:06.433 --> 02:42:07.353]  Period.
[02:42:07.414 --> 02:42:09.755]  Yeah, the question is, I'm sure it can be proven.
[02:42:10.214 --> 02:42:11.295]  I'm sure we all know the truth.
[02:42:11.615 --> 02:42:13.015]  How do you get it publicized?
[02:42:13.056 --> 02:42:13.636]  That's the point.
[02:42:13.656 --> 02:42:16.017]  How do you get the world to wake up to that?
[02:42:16.057 --> 02:42:20.259]  You aggressively promote the alternative media that's already exploding, but not fast enough.
[02:42:20.559 --> 02:42:21.520]  Thanks for the call, Derek.
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:24.121]  Steve, in North Carolina, you're on the air.
[02:42:25.362 --> 02:42:30.524]  Hey, just want to say I've bought two copies of America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:42:31.045 --> 02:42:32.766]  One I mailed home to my family in Indiana.
[02:42:34.264 --> 02:42:35.784]  Is circulating around here.
[02:42:36.565 --> 02:42:40.506]  I'm in the Marine Corps, and it's circulating around my squadron right now.
[02:42:40.526 --> 02:42:41.766]  A lot of people are getting to view it.
[02:42:42.266 --> 02:42:43.787]  I've got people coming up asking me.
[02:42:44.427 --> 02:42:48.288]  I've had the Sergeant Major come up and ask me about Loose Change.
[02:42:48.668 --> 02:42:49.789]  You know, he wants to check it out.
[02:42:49.969 --> 02:42:50.589]  Where's the website?
[02:42:50.609 --> 02:42:51.129]  He can view it.
[02:42:51.449 --> 02:42:54.030]  I told him I've got a copy of American Freedom to Fashion.
[02:42:54.110 --> 02:42:55.570]  Please give him a Terror Storm.
[02:42:55.690 --> 02:42:57.051]  Please give him a Terror Storm, too.
[02:42:57.471 --> 02:43:01.352]  I'm calling in on the 1st after I get paid to buy another couple copies of
[02:43:02.432 --> 02:43:05.794]  End results film and then I'm calling and I'm going to get the Terror Storm DVD.
[02:43:06.235 --> 02:43:09.837]  Also, I just want to let you guys know kind of what we're up against here in the military.
[02:43:09.997 --> 02:43:19.384]  A lot of people are informed, but there's no... Right against this right here, I've got a class that I'm required to take called Terrorism Awareness.
[02:43:20.024 --> 02:43:24.247]  And it says right here in the book, never assume that your surveillance are men.
[02:43:24.267 --> 02:43:27.790]  Talking about terrorism, terrorists watching at all times.
[02:43:27.830 --> 02:43:28.250]  Terrorism,
[02:43:29.065 --> 02:43:36.448]  It's not a phenomenon of only the male gender, not only are terrorists recognizable by any features that they would display.
[02:43:36.468 --> 02:43:38.589]  They could very easily be women or children.
[02:43:39.229 --> 02:43:40.770]  You know, terrorists can be women and children.
[02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:46.192]  Oh yeah, they're telling towns that have got like a hundred people in it, don't trust your neighbors, they could be terrorists.
[02:43:46.512 --> 02:43:48.472]  It's just all part of pushing a police state.
[02:43:48.753 --> 02:43:50.333]  We know who's really behind the terrorism.
[02:43:50.913 --> 02:43:57.576]  Exactly, and it goes through special interest groups, abortion, anyone who opposes abortion, animal rights,
[02:43:58.044 --> 02:43:59.405]  Property rights, does it list them?
[02:43:59.886 --> 02:44:01.287]  I'm very curious about some of them.
[02:44:01.507 --> 02:44:11.054]  Environmentalists, it goes through and says anyone who belongs to those groups, as a result, such groups are labeled as terrorist groups.
[02:44:11.215 --> 02:44:14.037]  I want you to make me a Xerox copy of that, I want you to send it to me.
[02:44:14.417 --> 02:44:25.586]  And the reason is, if you see Terror Storm, we show manuals from North Carolina, Texas, Arizona, and several other places where they say, land rights activists, terrorists.
[02:44:26.429 --> 02:44:28.150]  Uh, where they say, gun owners, terrorists.
[02:44:28.470 --> 02:44:32.532]  And you've just got a variant of that, but this is what they're teaching the Marines.
[02:44:33.172 --> 02:44:34.733]  And, uh, Aaron, you want to comment on this?
[02:44:34.913 --> 02:44:36.334]  Yeah, I'm very curious about something.
[02:44:36.714 --> 02:44:41.476]  When you show the film to other Marines of the major, what are their responses to the film, to Freedom to Fascism?
[02:44:42.197 --> 02:44:44.418]  Um, they're, they're always positive.
[02:44:44.438 --> 02:44:47.699]  They're always, you know, well, what's the next step I've got?
[02:44:47.939 --> 02:44:54.583]  Especially, uh, at the lower levels, I, you know, I have 5 or 10 guys come over to my room and watch it on my, uh, laptop computer.
[02:44:56.055 --> 02:44:56.235]  No.
[02:44:57.597 --> 02:44:59.358]  And they want to know, what do we do next?
[02:44:59.378 --> 02:45:00.820]  In other words, they understand the truth.
[02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:05.584]  They spread the word to the next group and then have them force multiply that out to the next group.
[02:45:06.285 --> 02:45:06.645]  Exactly.
[02:45:07.106 --> 02:45:10.189]  Therefore, basically voting out the people who are in control now.
[02:45:10.589 --> 02:45:12.150]  And that's where I offer up Ron Paul.
[02:45:13.257 --> 02:45:14.018]  Right, exactly.
[02:45:14.058 --> 02:45:14.979]  It's a ripple effect.
[02:45:15.319 --> 02:45:19.422]  You gotta get those people who see the film to show it to others, to keep spreading it around.
[02:45:19.442 --> 02:45:25.187]  Look, a legitimate government wouldn't be teaching the Marine Corps that the American people and children are terrorists, okay?
[02:45:25.207 --> 02:45:31.212]  I have FEMA on tape teaching Kansas City police and firemen and sheriff's deputies that, quote, all Christians are terrorists.
[02:45:31.532 --> 02:45:34.295]  I mean, this stuff's so crazy, folks, I know you don't believe me hearing it.
[02:45:34.575 --> 02:45:37.337]  I'm telling you, we got it on video, not just the manuals.
[02:45:37.397 --> 02:45:38.899]  This is off the charts.
[02:45:39.279 --> 02:45:41.501]  Only terrorists would teach you that!
[02:45:42.699 --> 02:45:45.680]  This is the Activism Tool, which is useful.
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:56.382]  Calling into other radio programs and asking them every time they mention Hillary Clinton, mention Ron Paul, just tape it up I guess on their teleprompter or their script, whatever they're reading off of.
[02:45:56.602 --> 02:45:58.323]  Well, Steve, do me a favor.
[02:45:58.463 --> 02:45:59.583]  Will you make me a copy?
[02:45:59.603 --> 02:46:00.543]  What's the name of the manual?
[02:46:01.243 --> 02:46:04.304]  It's Terrorism Awareness from the Marine Corps Institute.
[02:46:05.204 --> 02:46:07.065]  Yeah, and really all that is is an ADL.
[02:46:07.345 --> 02:46:08.605]  That's why I can tell you what it says.
[02:46:09.306 --> 02:46:14.811]  To Terrorism Awareness Marine Corps Institute.
[02:46:15.152 --> 02:46:27.504]  We can probably find a manual online, but... If you type in MCI into Google, just MCI, you can click on the Marine Corps Institute website where you can order the manuals if you're a Marine.
[02:46:28.304 --> 02:46:32.909]  You put in your information and you can get them mailed to you and take the classes.
[02:46:33.601 --> 02:46:34.641]  Or you can take them online.
[02:46:35.522 --> 02:46:37.163]  So it's restricted.
[02:46:37.183 --> 02:46:40.964]  Then I need you to make me a copy of that.
[02:46:41.445 --> 02:46:47.407]  Or if you just want to send me the manual with a note, we'll send you a couple free TerraStorms for the price of the manual.
[02:46:47.607 --> 02:46:49.208]  Will you get that to me immediately, please?
[02:46:49.748 --> 02:46:50.268]  Yes, I will.
[02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:52.790]  Alright, God bless you, sir.
[02:46:52.810 --> 02:46:53.870]  God bless you, Steve.
[02:46:53.910 --> 02:46:54.750]  Thank you very much.
[02:46:54.771 --> 02:46:55.851]  Steve, anything else you want to add?
[02:46:56.971 --> 02:46:58.892]  No, I just want to thank you both for the work you're doing.
[02:46:59.132 --> 02:47:00.113]  You've got a lot of support here.
[02:47:00.646 --> 02:47:01.286]  Well, I know.
[02:47:01.366 --> 02:47:03.407]  I mean, I got troops all over... Spread this throughout all the Marines.
[02:47:03.427 --> 02:47:04.728]  Spread this through the Marine Corps.
[02:47:05.108 --> 02:47:05.929]  As best you can.
[02:47:06.029 --> 02:47:11.932]  Oh, listen, Aaron, we ship videos every day into camps in Iraq to Marines and Army soldiers.
[02:47:12.452 --> 02:47:14.833]  Steve, promise me that you'll send it to me.
[02:47:15.814 --> 02:47:16.934]  It'll be in the mail tomorrow, Alex.
[02:47:17.074 --> 02:47:18.335]  Okay, do you have my mailing address?
[02:47:19.869 --> 02:47:21.470]  No, is it not on your website?
[02:47:21.530 --> 02:47:22.671]  It is.
[02:47:22.691 --> 02:47:28.114]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:47:30.075 --> 02:47:32.756]  And put a note in there saying Alex says give this to him now.
[02:47:33.577 --> 02:47:37.599]  And we'll put it up on the site and scans of it and write an article, okay?
[02:47:38.464 --> 02:47:39.244]  All right, no problem, Max.
[02:47:39.645 --> 02:47:41.985]  Thank you, because we've got it from all the law enforcement.
[02:47:42.025 --> 02:47:43.806]  We don't have it from the Marine Corps.
[02:47:44.346 --> 02:47:45.327]  Pretty scary, Aaron.
[02:47:46.027 --> 02:47:46.927]  It's unbelievable.
[02:47:46.968 --> 02:47:48.768]  It's like everybody's living in the Matrix.
[02:47:49.108 --> 02:47:51.369]  They've created a Matrix that the world is living in now.
[02:47:51.870 --> 02:47:53.230]  And we've got to break that Matrix.
[02:47:54.010 --> 02:47:55.011]  People have to know the truth.
[02:47:55.451 --> 02:47:57.012]  They have to see the reality of what's happening.
[02:47:57.032 --> 02:48:02.114]  Well, I've got to tell you, almost every soldier I run into on the streets is already a fan of the truth, and they know what's going on.
[02:48:02.734 --> 02:48:04.955]  And then you see the high-level officers, they just look sad.
[02:48:04.975 --> 02:48:06.916]  It's scary.
[02:48:07.136 --> 02:48:07.636]  It's scary.
[02:48:08.743 --> 02:48:12.547]  I feel sorry for these poor boys who are going over to Iraq and dying for nothing.
[02:48:13.368 --> 02:48:15.250]  Yeah, and then being trained that we're all terrorists.
[02:48:16.151 --> 02:48:17.472]  Well, the criminals run the government.
[02:48:17.492 --> 02:48:21.656]  They're not going to get away with it thanks to American Freedom from Fascism, Terror Storm, and films of that nature.
[02:48:22.177 --> 02:48:22.858]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:22.918 --> 02:48:23.538]  Final segment.
[02:48:34.813 --> 02:48:37.976]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:38.316 --> 02:48:40.237]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:40.638 --> 02:48:48.304]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:48.964 --> 02:48:56.030]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:48:56.430 --> 02:49:03.296]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:49:03.792 --> 02:49:07.833]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:08.133 --> 02:49:11.674]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:12.114 --> 02:49:14.035]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:14.375 --> 02:49:18.296]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:27.623 --> 02:50:30.284]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[02:50:31.425 --> 02:50:31.885]  Dad!
[02:50:32.492 --> 02:50:33.253]  Can we stop?
[02:50:33.573 --> 02:50:35.114]  We need to go to the bathroom.
[02:50:35.534 --> 02:50:35.774]  What?
[02:50:36.134 --> 02:50:36.515]  Again?
[02:50:36.915 --> 02:50:38.536]  We just stopped two hours ago.
[02:50:38.596 --> 02:50:39.616]  Honey, let's stop.
[02:50:39.897 --> 02:50:43.039]  Because I gave the kids their Spark Berkey water bottles.
[02:50:43.259 --> 02:50:44.539]  Why did you do that?
[02:50:44.760 --> 02:50:47.041]  Because they can't drink and talk at the same time.
[02:50:47.181 --> 02:50:50.563]  And that way we don't have to listen to them singing, Are we there yet?
[02:50:50.863 --> 02:50:51.884]  Are we there yet?
[02:50:51.984 --> 02:50:53.065]  For the entire trip.
[02:50:53.305 --> 02:50:53.705]  Hmm.
[02:50:54.246 --> 02:50:55.506]  I didn't think about that.
[02:50:55.987 --> 02:50:57.007]  Great idea.
[02:50:57.287 --> 02:50:59.829]  Yeah, and it's cheap entertainment for the kids.
[02:51:00.225 --> 02:51:02.690]  Bottled water costs around 75 cents a bottle.
[02:51:02.890 --> 02:51:07.278]  And using our Berkey Sport Bottles, it costs us less than two and a half cents per refill.
[02:51:07.579 --> 02:51:07.880]  Honey!
[02:51:08.686 --> 02:51:09.947]  You're terrific!
[02:51:10.327 --> 02:51:11.828]  Oh, honey, so are you!
[02:51:11.928 --> 02:51:15.349]  You're the one that bought the family our Sport Berkey Water Bottles!
[02:51:15.629 --> 02:51:16.410]  Now can we stop?
[02:51:16.910 --> 02:51:17.651]  I need to go too.
[02:51:17.951 --> 02:51:22.393]  Get your Berkey Sport Purification Bottle for only $39 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:53.422 --> 02:51:54.122]  Welcome back.
[02:51:54.683 --> 02:51:56.443]  Final segment with Aaron Russo.
[02:51:57.224 --> 02:51:57.784]  Pray for him.
[02:51:57.804 --> 02:51:59.745]  Get his DVD at Infowars.com.
[02:51:59.765 --> 02:52:02.106]  The new film, America, Freedom to Fascism.
[02:52:02.146 --> 02:52:03.186]  Get him out to everybody.
[02:52:03.206 --> 02:52:03.886]  Toll-free number, 888-253-3139.
[02:52:04.206 --> 02:52:05.327]  Coming up tomorrow night, 730 to 1030.
[02:52:05.407 --> 02:52:07.088]  We want to go that long.
[02:52:07.108 --> 02:52:08.988]  I'm going to give an hour-long speech.
[02:52:16.406 --> 02:52:22.593]  And, of course, Jack Blood will give a 30-minute, former city council member and anti-new order crusader, George Humphreys, will give a 30-minute speech.
[02:52:23.214 --> 02:52:28.960]  And then we will have roughly about 45 minutes at the end to take a bunch of questions.
[02:52:29.501 --> 02:52:31.262]  So it's going to be a great event at the UT.
[02:52:33.074 --> 02:52:37.156]  Yeah, real quick, I just want to say that you guys are two great patriots.
[02:53:00.956 --> 02:53:16.628]  My question for both of you is, not only would they obviously put all kinds of roadblocks in front of us, but what kind of effect would a 9-11 movie, let's say written and produced by Alex Jones and you and Oliver Stone, what kind of effect do you think that would have?
[02:53:18.510 --> 02:53:19.651]  I'm not sure I understand the question.
[02:53:19.691 --> 02:53:21.592]  He's saying should we make a movie with Oliver Stone.
[02:53:21.652 --> 02:53:24.034]  I think Oliver Stone's gone over to the other side, my friend.
[02:53:24.054 --> 02:53:25.435]  Oh, I don't know.
[02:53:25.615 --> 02:53:26.356]  I don't know.
[02:53:26.896 --> 02:53:28.658]  I mean, we could make a movie about 9-11.
[02:53:28.678 --> 02:53:30.119]  The question is how do you fund it?
[02:53:31.267 --> 02:53:38.630]  I'm actually working on a movie now that I think is even better than 9-11 that's incisive about a solution on how to fix things in America.
[02:53:38.650 --> 02:53:46.053]  I'm not going to get into it today, but the question I deal with is how do you fund these movies and get them distributed if they're so expensive?
[02:53:47.073 --> 02:53:49.254]  To make a good 9-11 film, you have to have at least 25 mil.
[02:53:49.894 --> 02:53:53.535]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joseph in New Mexico.
[02:53:53.575 --> 02:53:54.156]  Go ahead, Joseph.
[02:53:55.056 --> 02:54:00.298]  What an honor and a privilege it is to speak to two men of true integrity and valor.
[02:54:01.643 --> 02:54:03.705]  Mr. Russo, you know what?
[02:54:04.306 --> 02:54:07.909]  I got the greatest prayer warrior praying for you right now.
[02:54:07.929 --> 02:54:08.529]  That's my mother.
[02:54:08.549 --> 02:54:13.093]  I wish you the best.
[02:54:13.273 --> 02:54:14.014]  And you know what?
[02:54:14.054 --> 02:54:16.256]  When I grow up, I want to be just like you and Alex.
[02:54:17.397 --> 02:54:18.098]  Very sweet.
[02:54:18.178 --> 02:54:19.098]  Thank you so much.
[02:54:19.599 --> 02:54:21.060]  That's very kind of you to say that.
[02:54:21.140 --> 02:54:24.063]  You don't know how much those comments mean to me.
[02:54:24.083 --> 02:54:24.563]  They really do.
[02:54:24.603 --> 02:54:25.504]  They mean an awful lot.
[02:54:26.205 --> 02:54:27.105]  God bless you, sir.
[02:54:27.406 --> 02:54:28.106]  God bless you, sir.
[02:54:29.557 --> 02:54:29.857]  I don't
[02:54:47.390 --> 02:54:58.760]  And as we challenge people to get America freedom to fascism, and show it to everybody in their area like that young Marine is doing, and having an effect in the battle for this Republic, I commend you, I salute you, and thanks for your support for Ron Paul.
[02:54:59.120 --> 02:55:02.403]  I'm right there with you, the exact same view, and God bless, my friend.
[02:55:02.824 --> 02:55:03.404]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:55:03.764 --> 02:55:05.066]  April 15th is coming.
[02:55:05.466 --> 02:55:07.828]  The movie is even more important this coming season.
[02:55:08.228 --> 02:55:10.430]  Go out, order the movie from InfoWars.
[02:55:10.911 --> 02:55:11.792]  Go on Google.
[02:55:11.832 --> 02:55:13.333]  Listen, everybody out there, please.
[02:55:13.769 --> 02:55:15.710]  You know, we're number four today on Google.
[02:55:15.990 --> 02:55:17.010]  Let's go to number one.
[02:55:17.350 --> 02:55:23.232]  If everybody out there will go to Google and put the movie on on Google Video, maybe we'll go to number one tomorrow.
[02:55:23.973 --> 02:55:24.293]  Okay?
[02:55:24.393 --> 02:55:25.813]  Order the movie from InfoWars.
[02:55:26.193 --> 02:55:27.314]  God bless everybody.
[02:55:27.654 --> 02:55:28.814]  Thank you for your prayers.
[02:55:28.954 --> 02:55:29.715]  I love you all.
[02:55:29.995 --> 02:55:34.556]  Let's restore the Republic and support Ron Paul to the very fullest we can.
[02:55:34.896 --> 02:55:35.317]  All right.
[02:55:35.577 --> 02:55:36.137]  I agree.
[02:55:36.177 --> 02:55:36.617]  God bless.
[02:55:36.657 --> 02:55:37.297]  Take care, Aaron.
[02:55:37.577 --> 02:55:38.198]  Thank you, buddy.
[02:55:38.358 --> 02:55:39.038]  Talk to you soon.
[02:55:39.815 --> 02:55:41.096]  Another powerful transmission.
[02:55:41.116 --> 02:55:43.157]  I want to thank everybody at Genesis for running the show.
[02:55:43.197 --> 02:55:45.279]  The sponsors, the listeners, God above.
[02:55:45.819 --> 02:55:49.082]  My family, my team, Kevin Smith, everybody here at the office.
[02:55:49.722 --> 02:55:52.704]  The Project for New American Citizen is putting on the big event.
[02:55:53.044 --> 02:55:57.367]  Alex Jones Live at the UT Ballroom with George Humphreys and Jack Blood.
[02:55:57.528 --> 02:55:58.428]  I've invited them along.
[02:55:59.249 --> 02:56:00.990]  I don't want to steal all the spotlight.
[02:56:01.010 --> 02:56:03.132]  And it's going to be a great event.
[02:56:03.152 --> 02:56:04.473]  I hope to see you there tomorrow.
[02:56:04.733 --> 02:56:06.674]  We'll see you back on the radio tomorrow as well.
[02:56:07.014 --> 02:56:07.495]  Take care.
[02:56:11.957 --> 02:56:16.201]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
