[00:00:00.683 --> 00:00:01.363]  He stands for truth.
[00:00:01.383 --> 00:00:02.564]  He stands for justice.
[00:00:02.764 --> 00:00:03.845]  He stands for what's right.
[00:00:03.865 --> 00:00:07.406]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:08.847]  Call Alex now, toll free.
[00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:29.709]  At 877-590-5525.
[00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.836]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:45.906]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:46.506 --> 00:00:46.906]  Welcome.
[00:00:47.086 --> 00:00:54.329]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live February 11, 2007 Sunday edition.
[00:00:54.889 --> 00:01:05.294]  I'm a syndicated radio talk show host Monday through Friday, and I, in the last three or four months, have started this new Sunday broadcast in association with MS Communications and Genesis Communications.
[00:01:06.334 --> 00:01:13.017]  I know a lot of new affiliates are turning us on last week and this week, so I'll spend a few minutes telling you a little bit about myself.
[00:01:13.726 --> 00:01:15.507]  Coming up later in this hour.
[00:01:16.048 --> 00:01:18.630]  But first off, Putin says U.S.
[00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.451]  wants to dominate the world.
[00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:35.282]  And we'll break down exactly what this inflammatory speech, the most inflammatory that he's given since he became the president in Russia back in late 1999 when he replaced Boris Yeltsin.
[00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:36.482]  Also, U.S.
[00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:37.043]  forces
[00:01:37.808 --> 00:01:41.651]  Show evidence of Iranian arms in Iraq.
[00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:46.915]  This is out of Reuters, but you read deeper into the story, there really is no evidence being shown.
[00:01:46.935 --> 00:02:00.705]  The editor and publisher of the Watchdog Group has done an analysis of this, and it's actually the very same New York Times reporter that put out the lies about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq that is saying this today.
[00:02:00.765 --> 00:02:03.287]  So we'll be breaking that down for you.
[00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:12.476]  Plus, I saw preliminary numbers coming out of the Governmental Accounting Office late in 2006 on this subject.
[00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:15.318]  Now we have the official final numbers.
[00:02:16.616 --> 00:02:34.145]  2006 personal savings dropped to a 74 year low, but you actually read into the numbers, it's the biggest low in recorded modern economic history in the United States, lower than the depths of the depression, the previous record in late
[00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:53.916]  1933 recognized as the bottom point in the modern United States economic history, and we'll talk more about what's coming in 2007, some of the real economic indicators that affect your pocketbook, your savings, the very value of our currency, the good old greenback.
[00:02:55.537 --> 00:02:58.079]  But first let me spend just a minute or two talking about who I am.
[00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:00.555]  I am a constitutionalist.
[00:03:00.676 --> 00:03:04.477]  I don't look at things on the scale of left versus right.
[00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:21.461]  In fact, until about a hundred years ago, that was not the scale that was used by the American people, or anyone in the Western world, or on the planet for that matter, to judge a political system, a leader, a king, a parliament, a legislature.
[00:03:22.111 --> 00:03:26.317]  The benchmark that was used was liberty versus tyranny.
[00:03:27.118 --> 00:03:31.004]  Was the government working for elites or was it working for the people?
[00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:37.013]  And I'm a constitutionalist and I know that both political parties, the Republicans and Democrats,
[00:03:37.944 --> 00:03:43.928]  For at least 60 years, have been completely bought and paid for by multinational corporations.
[00:03:44.008 --> 00:03:54.334]  Of the 100 biggest economies in the world, the Forbes 100 biggest economies, 46 of them, up from 42 in 2005, 46 of them now, and the numbers coming out at the end of 2006, are corporations.
[00:04:00.484 --> 00:04:03.046]  And they don't operate, many of them, in a free market fashion.
[00:04:03.086 --> 00:04:19.237]  They operate in a governmental fashion, in a predatory fashion, crony capitalism or monopoly capitalism, actually seeking to destroy middle classes, destroy markets, in a consolatory phase, in an attempt to consolidate.
[00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:23.640]  So, basically, I'm here wanting the Bill of Rights and Constitution back.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.161]  I'm a counter-revolutionary.
[00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:30.164]  These globalist interests have come in and bought off and paid off and controlled most of our state.
[00:04:31.265 --> 00:04:54.786]  politicians at the state level and federal, and are lobbying the government piecemeal, incrementally, but now we're deep into it, to sign over our national sovereignty into these unelected, unaccountable, international bodies which serve at the behest of these 46 major corporations and their allied crime syndicates that are working in unison.
[00:04:55.592 --> 00:05:02.337]  So, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, George Bush, Jeb Bush, Newt Gingrich, they're not going to save you.
[00:05:02.357 --> 00:05:03.278]  They're not even leaders.
[00:05:03.598 --> 00:05:04.259]  They're puppets.
[00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.400]  They're nobodies.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.540]  They run nothing.
[00:05:06.841 --> 00:05:13.526]  And we're here to get you to think outside the box and begin to realize that so we can get back into a liberty culture.
[00:05:13.946 --> 00:05:21.592]  We'll also have wide open phones this afternoon, this evening, depending on which time zone you're listening to us in across the United States and Canada.
[00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:30.678]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-590-5525, 877-590-5525, or locally in Central Texas, if you're listening to the station we broadcast out of the bowels of, and that's KLBJ 590, and that's 836-0590.
[00:05:30.738 --> 00:05:30.978]  Alright!
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:55.453]  Before I get into the latest war news and the war drums beating for Iran and World War III on the horizon, before we break down what's happening with the economy or what Putin's saying, and before we go to your calls, I wanted to spend a few minutes talking about the surveillance society.
[00:05:56.774 --> 00:05:59.897]  Now, we've had lie detectors around for over 65 years.
[00:06:01.913 --> 00:06:05.275]  And for the last 20, they've been completely and totally discredited.
[00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:18.421]  And just in the last few years, there is hardly any court in the land, state or federal, or for that matter, in even civil proceedings, where lie detector tests are admissible.
[00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:27.926]  Well, that hasn't stopped corporations and the government and different law enforcement agencies from producing more modern forms of quackery and black box frauds.
[00:06:28.566 --> 00:06:56.899]  They have come out with all sorts of fancy new systems that supposedly passively scan your brain for heat signatures and neuron brain electrochemical emissions and they're coming out with all sorts of new cameras that measure how fast you blink your eyes or what facial expressions you make and almost all the major studies out there that are independent by universities and government show this is even more of a fraud than the classical lie detector
[00:06:57.893 --> 00:07:01.816]  Following your blood pressure and your heartbeat.
[00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:06.239]  That is, you can trick people into admitting they're lying.
[00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:17.286]  It's more of a fraud device, and you could argue in some cases there is some uses of it, but because it cannot prove guilt within a shadow of a doubt, it's totally worthless.
[00:07:17.326 --> 00:07:26.012]  Well, moving away from the classical lie detector, they now have systems that the companies selling them can't even basically describe how they work.
[00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:32.621]  And they even tried to use these in court cases the last few years in the US, Canada, the UK, and of course Europe.
[00:07:32.961 --> 00:07:35.363]  And it's been thrown out in almost every single case.
[00:07:35.983 --> 00:07:37.284]  But that isn't stopping them.
[00:07:38.085 --> 00:07:46.151]  Cameras in New York, cameras in London, cameras in Chicago are now being fitted as of the last month with federal grants.
[00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:58.198]  with face scanning systems that pick up different facial expressions that supposedly show that you're angry or planning something violent or being deceptive.
[00:07:58.859 --> 00:08:05.002]  They are putting in passive MRIs at five US airports.
[00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:10.846]  They put some in in 2002, now they're expanding, that passively supposedly scan for your brainwaves.
[00:08:11.406 --> 00:08:15.929]  And then they come and question you saying, well the brain scan shows you might be a terrorist.
[00:08:17.392 --> 00:08:21.156]  I mean, how ridiculous, how transparent is this?
[00:08:21.176 --> 00:08:24.460]  This is just an excuse to claim that they have probable causes.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:32.909]  This is an excuse to catch wider and wider groups of people in a drag debt, in a massive drag debt, and it has nothing to do with a free society.
[00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:49.379]  And don't forget, the Associated Press late last year reported that our borders are still completely wide open, basically, and that illegal aliens at 800 plus major lending institutions in this country don't even need to show any form of ID to get bank accounts, housing loans, or car loans.
[00:08:49.959 --> 00:08:55.081]  But they're going to fit the airports and the streets with brain scanners for the citizens.
[00:08:55.121 --> 00:08:57.022]  This is a complete and total joke.
[00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:04.172]  And I have our Associated Press, Reuters, and I have a London Guardian reports here in front of me.
[00:09:04.232 --> 00:09:05.252]  Here's the London Guardian.
[00:09:05.572 --> 00:09:06.552]  Came out on Friday.
[00:09:06.972 --> 00:09:09.853]  The brain scan that can read people's intentions.
[00:09:10.713 --> 00:09:12.594]  Now, see, that's a deceptive headline right there.
[00:09:13.334 --> 00:09:16.995]  And it's being billed everywhere as just, oh my gosh, we know when you're lying now.
[00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:17.875]  It's not a crime.
[00:09:18.135 --> 00:09:19.396]  And then here's another one when we get back.
[00:09:19.716 --> 00:09:23.557]  The tiny airplane spy that spots bombers in the blink of an eye.
[00:09:24.077 --> 00:09:27.058]  Every seat to be
[00:09:28.285 --> 00:09:32.147]  You're fitted with a micro camera scanning your face the entire time you're on an aircraft.
[00:09:32.708 --> 00:09:34.028]  Oh, that's not tyranny.
[00:09:34.529 --> 00:09:35.409]  We'll be right back.
[00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:37.811]  Stay with us.
[00:10:03.599 --> 00:10:09.086]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:10:09.447 --> 00:10:17.056]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:10:17.771 --> 00:10:24.835]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:10:25.235 --> 00:10:36.641]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:40.883]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:10:40.903 --> 00:10:42.864]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:47.026]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:11:00.374 --> 00:11:05.898]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:11:07.058 --> 00:11:11.881]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:11:12.081 --> 00:11:14.823]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:11:14.863 --> 00:11:15.944]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:11:17.313 --> 00:11:21.894]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:30.096]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[00:14:40.221 --> 00:14:44.323]  Coming up, after the bottom of the hour, news and messages.
[00:14:44.363 --> 00:14:44.943]  So stay with us.

[00:14:46.524 --> 00:14:48.765]  Any issue, any news item, any question, any comment.
[00:14:49.065 --> 00:14:50.746]  You want to call up and get in my face?
[00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:51.847]  You agree with me?
[00:14:51.927 --> 00:14:53.688]  Hey, we don't screen your calls.
[00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:57.129]  We just get you on air and we're ready to defend our ideas here.
[00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:58.270]  Alright.
[00:14:58.837 --> 00:15:10.686]  So I remember about eight, nine years ago, finding out about federal and state grants to put cameras and microphones in public schools, to put up fences around them, to start searching the children, training them how to be prisoners.
[00:15:10.766 --> 00:15:22.896]  And then, about five years ago, it started in Tennessee and New York, you'd hear about cameras in the bathrooms, or cameras in the school showers, and a visiting team would come and be taking showers, you know, in the seventh grade.
[00:15:23.096 --> 00:15:23.997]  One case in Tennessee,
[00:15:24.697 --> 00:15:27.120]  And the other girl saw the cameras and ran out screaming.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.422]  And the school said, what's the big deal?
[00:15:29.442 --> 00:15:31.564]  Of course we have cameras in the showers.
[00:15:31.604 --> 00:15:33.786]  And of course it's recorded onto a computer hard drive.
[00:15:33.826 --> 00:15:39.412]  And it turned out that the school was quote, sharing it around the country with other principals and people.
[00:15:39.932 --> 00:15:46.699]  And all over the nation, rest stops have put first cameras in the bathroom areas and then now in the stalls themselves.
[00:15:46.719 --> 00:15:47.160]  I mean, that's 1984.
[00:15:48.761 --> 00:16:00.149]  That's the ultimate vision of a police state to people back in the 40s, late 40s, like George Orwell, pen name George Orwell, real name Eric Blair, was in the future, cameras in the bathrooms.
[00:16:00.229 --> 00:16:12.597]  Well, in George Orwell's 1984, they didn't have cameras that scanned your facial movements, and they had AI software looking to see if you're trying to be deceptive, or if you're trying to hide something.
[00:16:12.877 --> 00:16:14.298]  And again, it's total quackery.
[00:16:14.398 --> 00:16:16.520]  It violates the Fourth Amendment.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:18.361]  It violates privacy.
[00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:22.383]  And I have a UK Mail on Sunday report here.
[00:16:22.803 --> 00:16:24.264]  I have another one out of Reuters.
[00:16:25.044 --> 00:16:27.225]  Two separate reports, yesterday and today.
[00:16:27.605 --> 00:16:31.867]  The tiny airplane spy that spots bombers in the blink of an eye.
[00:16:32.147 --> 00:16:41.892]  Tiny cameras the size of a fingernail linked to specialist computers are to be used to monitor the behavior of airline passengers as part of the war on terrorism.
[00:16:41.952 --> 00:16:44.373]  And it says Britain, Germany, the US,
[00:16:45.214 --> 00:16:51.982]  Huge funding to put these in and have them on every seat, watching you the entire time.
[00:16:52.362 --> 00:16:59.690]  And if you don't think planes don't already have cameras in them, watching just the general areas, you need to do some research.
[00:17:00.011 --> 00:17:00.812]  All of them do now.
[00:17:01.312 --> 00:17:02.913]  Except for some of the smaller commuter planes.
[00:17:03.294 --> 00:17:04.535]  But this is Big Brother!
[00:17:04.915 --> 00:17:08.357]  And now they're talking about having cameras that watch you and all the cars.
[00:17:08.658 --> 00:17:15.943]  Toyota last year said, well, so kids don't get locked in the car, we'll have a cell phone built in, that's what OnStar is, basically into all the cars.
[00:17:16.603 --> 00:17:25.710]  And if the car gets too hot and there's pressure sensors showing people are still sitting in it, it will dial police and then show them the video image.
[00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:29.453]  Well, you know good and well they're going to use that outside of just that use.
[00:17:30.443 --> 00:17:36.048]  All the new computers that are coming out for Mac and most of the new PCs have built-in cameras right above the screen.
[00:17:36.668 --> 00:17:39.491]  They're in the outside, on the edge, on the border.
[00:17:39.531 --> 00:17:42.954]  My wife bought a new Mac and sure enough there's the camera, there's the microphone.
[00:17:43.254 --> 00:17:46.556]  And I warned you, they're going to use that to watch you and listen to you with keyboard computers.
[00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:49.999]  Google comes out four months ago, months after I made the prediction.
[00:17:50.019 --> 00:17:50.740]  Not hard to do.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.501]  If they've got it, they will use it.
[00:17:52.862 --> 00:17:55.924]  Just type in Google to use cameras and microphones to watch and listen to you.
[00:17:56.064 --> 00:17:56.805]  And they said, don't worry.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.081]  People aren't going to be watching you.
[00:18:01.121 --> 00:18:05.342]  Computers will be logging every word that's said, and then we'll use that to advertise at you.
[00:18:05.602 --> 00:18:12.484]  Imagine if somebody knocked on your door, and said, I'm going to put cameras and microphones in your house and watch you, and then I'll pay you to do this.
[00:18:12.504 --> 00:18:13.985]  99.9% would say way... I mean, way more than 99% of it.
[00:18:18.346 --> 00:18:22.607]  Maybe one out of a thousand might say, okay, go ahead, watch me in my house.
[00:18:22.987 --> 00:18:27.988]  But Google just does it, and it's announced, and very few people seem to even pay attention.
[00:18:28.348 --> 00:18:34.810]  Now to show how much our culture has changed, and I wouldn't say how accepting people have gotten of this.
[00:18:35.090 --> 00:18:40.591]  People don't like it, but they have a feeling of they can't change it, they can't fight it, that's just the way it is.
[00:18:41.091 --> 00:18:46.412]  But here is a little minute and a half clip or so from
[00:18:47.412 --> 00:18:51.314]  The program Mayberry.
[00:18:51.454 --> 00:18:52.294]  What's the name of the show?
[00:18:53.835 --> 00:18:54.435]  Andy Griffith.
[00:18:54.475 --> 00:18:55.855]  I made a big mistake today, folks.
[00:18:56.195 --> 00:18:57.016]  It's my birthday today.
[00:18:57.056 --> 00:18:58.156]  My wife said, go ahead and take a nap.
[00:18:58.176 --> 00:18:58.997]  We'll take care of the kids.
[00:18:59.357 --> 00:19:09.361]  I went to sleep about 1.30, woke up about 3, got up here to the studio, and this is one of the rare occasions where my photographic memory, of course, I would need a photographic memory to know the name of the show is Andy Griffith, would not be working.
[00:19:09.681 --> 00:19:11.762]  So I'm a little bit dodgy here, but I'm starting to wake up.
[00:19:11.822 --> 00:19:12.642]  I drank some coffee.
[00:19:13.122 --> 00:19:15.083]  Yeah, here's Andy Griffith from
[00:19:15.823 --> 00:19:16.444]  Wait a minute!
[00:19:16.484 --> 00:19:17.485]  What are you talking about?
[00:19:17.525 --> 00:19:18.906]  We bugged Mr. Brake's cell!
[00:19:38.038 --> 00:19:38.638]  You what?
[00:19:38.978 --> 00:19:40.899]  We bugged this guy with Arnold's tape recorder.
[00:19:41.059 --> 00:19:42.039]  Just listen to this, Paul.
[00:19:42.099 --> 00:19:42.999]  I can't listen to that.
[00:19:43.140 --> 00:19:45.020]  But Paul... Opie, I can't listen to that.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.020]  I'm not permitted.
[00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:47.761]  But Paul, you don't understand.
[00:19:47.781 --> 00:19:49.922]  Opie, I can't listen to this.
[00:19:50.862 --> 00:19:52.822]  Now, I told you about eavesdropping.
[00:19:53.062 --> 00:19:54.223]  But Paul, this is different.
[00:19:54.523 --> 00:19:55.503]  Yes, it's worse.
[00:19:56.223 --> 00:19:59.124]  You overheard a conversation that was supposed to be private.
[00:19:59.524 --> 00:20:01.325]  Now, I can't be a party to that.
[00:20:01.705 --> 00:20:04.786]  But Paul, if you just listen to this... Opie, I can't listen.
[00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.405]  Pa, you're wasting the tape!
[00:20:06.465 --> 00:20:08.226]  That's what I mean to do.
[00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:12.928]  You bugged a conversation between a lawyer and his client.
[00:20:13.888 --> 00:20:17.629]  Now that's violating one of the most sacred rights of privacy.
[00:20:18.169 --> 00:20:18.790]  But Pa!
[00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:19.730]  No buts.
[00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:26.352]  But if it helps the law... Opie, the law can't use this kind of help.
[00:20:27.813 --> 00:20:34.035]  Because whether a man is guilty or innocent, we have to find that out by due process of law.
[00:20:36.091 --> 00:20:40.772]  And then that protects the people, as well as the culture, as well as the precious state.
[00:20:41.443 --> 00:20:50.167]  And throughout history, it's always going to be the state and the powerful financial interests that use the state as its tool of control that are going to abuse the population.
[00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:55.229]  The government is always the most dangerous thing in history to populations.
[00:20:55.289 --> 00:20:57.810]  Go read what the Founding Fathers had to say.
[00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:03.053]  I mean, Ceausescu in Romania 30-something years ago had cameras and microphones on the street corners.
[00:21:03.473 --> 00:21:04.653]  Nothing near to what we have.
[00:21:04.773 --> 00:21:05.354]  I mean, I remember in 1998
[00:21:07.356 --> 00:21:13.100]  I saw the federal grant for $844,000 a year to put up hundreds of microphones around Austin.
[00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.702]  And the federal grant said microphones to listen to people.
[00:21:15.962 --> 00:21:19.705]  Now, when they put it on the cover of the Statesman, they said, gunshot detectors.
[00:21:21.566 --> 00:21:27.931]  Did you ever hear about anybody getting busted off the now thousands of microphones, quote, gunshot detectors they put up?
[00:21:28.011 --> 00:21:28.331]  No.
[00:21:28.832 --> 00:21:34.996]  They wire into the emergency management fusion centers paid for by FEMA, really the local regional
[00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:39.421]  Governorships that control our populations.
[00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:48.426]  This is a MIT, and MIT magazines bragged about it, military pentagon designed control grid over the people.
[00:21:48.546 --> 00:21:51.088]  And I'm moving faster because I've got so much evidence of this.
[00:21:52.089 --> 00:21:53.890]  Are cameras in bathrooms freedom?
[00:21:58.405 --> 00:22:02.847]  TV shows, like 24, where every other episode they torture people's children to get answers.
[00:22:02.907 --> 00:22:14.172]  And in the real world, the Attorney General writes memos saying they can torture people to death, and his deputy, John Yoo, writes memos saying they can torture children in front of their parents.
[00:22:15.392 --> 00:22:15.913]  You don't believe me?
[00:22:15.933 --> 00:22:18.434]  Just type in John Yoo, torture memos, torture children.
[00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:21.195]  You'll get mainstream reports, but again, back of the paper.
[00:22:22.035 --> 00:22:26.057]  So we've gone from Mayberry RFA, but our border was controlled then,
[00:22:26.886 --> 00:22:28.047]  We had real security then.
[00:22:28.548 --> 00:22:33.093]  Two cameras in school bathrooms, Google watching and listening to you.
[00:22:33.513 --> 00:22:35.315]  Everything you do being tracked and traced.
[00:22:35.896 --> 00:22:36.596]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:22:36.616 --> 00:22:40.841]  The websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and JonesReport.com.
[00:22:41.481 --> 00:22:48.309]  We're going to come back, go to some of your calls, then get into all the war news in Iraq and the war drums beating for an attack on Iran.
[00:22:49.009 --> 00:22:49.470]  Stay with us.
[00:23:00.535 --> 00:23:01.616]  How are you feeling today?
[00:23:01.636 --> 00:23:08.961]  I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[00:23:09.061 --> 00:23:13.544]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call Mangosteen.
[00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:19.929]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[00:23:20.169 --> 00:23:25.091]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potentials of this amazing fruit.
[00:23:25.411 --> 00:23:32.053]  This powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.
[00:23:32.313 --> 00:23:35.494]  You can have the 22-page e-booklet absolutely free.
[00:23:35.654 --> 00:23:40.175]  We'll also refer you a website with links to actual testimonials and product information.
[00:23:40.395 --> 00:23:42.536]  Could this fruit help you in your quest for total health?
[00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:46.317]  Find out why Magosteen is known as the Queen of All Fruits.
[00:23:46.357 --> 00:23:46.697]  I think so.
[00:24:01.269 --> 00:24:02.970]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:24:03.130 --> 00:24:04.370]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:07.452]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:24:07.812 --> 00:24:10.573]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:24:11.113 --> 00:24:17.856]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:24:47.066 --> 00:24:47.246]  Call 877-873-9626.
[00:24:47.306 --> 00:24:47.686]  That's 877-873-9626.
[00:24:59.969 --> 00:25:04.916]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:25:05.236 --> 00:25:07.118]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:25:07.319 --> 00:25:10.363]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:25:10.543 --> 00:25:13.687]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:25:13.987 --> 00:25:15.830]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:25:16.090 --> 00:25:19.792]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:25:20.092 --> 00:25:22.733]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:25:22.753 --> 00:25:27.616]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:25:27.856 --> 00:25:32.158]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:25:32.558 --> 00:25:36.881]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, packet B, the unholy alliance.
[00:25:37.201 --> 00:25:41.443]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:25:41.783 --> 00:25:45.465]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars,
[00:25:45.945 --> 00:25:46.386]  We're good.
[00:25:59.944 --> 00:26:02.626]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:26:02.926 --> 00:26:04.988]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:26:05.208 --> 00:26:07.749]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:12.573]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[00:26:12.673 --> 00:26:13.273]  Here's why.
[00:26:13.653 --> 00:26:19.918]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:26:20.178 --> 00:26:26.682]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[00:26:26.822 --> 00:26:28.263]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal
[00:26:29.364 --> 00:26:30.525]  And 100% ethical.
[00:26:30.745 --> 00:26:34.987]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:26:35.447 --> 00:26:39.550]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game.
[00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.651]  And above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:26:43.071 --> 00:26:43.792]  Get control.
[00:26:43.912 --> 00:26:44.532]  Get relief.
[00:26:44.732 --> 00:26:45.473]  Get some sleep.
[00:26:45.773 --> 00:26:46.774]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[00:26:46.814 --> 00:26:47.734]  That's www.outand90.com.
[00:26:47.834 --> 00:26:48.314]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:26:48.554 --> 00:26:48.795]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:06.093]  You're listening to GCN.
[00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:10.334]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:27:11.594 --> 00:27:14.135]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:16.856 --> 00:27:18.056]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:27:22.457 --> 00:27:27.098]  Waging war on corruption and yes, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.773]  Think about how far we've come in this country.
[00:27:31.934 --> 00:27:33.995]  How many liberties and freedoms have been eroded.
[00:27:34.955 --> 00:27:37.476]  And is the government and corporate interests in collusion?
[00:27:38.117 --> 00:27:39.257]  Are they slowing down?
[00:27:39.337 --> 00:27:47.741]  No, they're accelerating their program of total surveillance over the American people and the people of the world.
[00:27:48.262 --> 00:27:55.085]  I am glad to report to you, though, that every poll that's coming out, every indicator, every person I talk to on the street for that matter, or on talk radio,
[00:27:55.993 --> 00:28:01.856]  He is aware that everything is not perfect in the state of Denmark.
[00:28:02.416 --> 00:28:07.459]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to some of your calls, and then I'm going to get into the new developments concerning Iran and Iraq.
[00:28:07.499 --> 00:28:18.264]  You know that the military-industrial complex, if you listen to the show you know, planned all along an official Pentagon and Israeli document to invade Iraq, then to invade Iran and Syria.
[00:28:18.911 --> 00:28:26.274]  Whether you're for the war or not, the point is the American people have been lied to, not just about WMDs, but about the intentions all along.
[00:28:27.017 --> 00:28:35.722]  Many of our troops are starting their fourth tour in Iraq, and over 650,000 Iraqis have died in the last three and a half years of occupation.
[00:28:35.762 --> 00:28:38.783]  But we'll bring you up to speed on what's happening with the new developments.
[00:28:39.123 --> 00:28:55.872]  Reports that U.S.-led forces have shown evidence of Iranian arms trafficking in Iraq, but the source of this is the same New York Times reporter who was caught making up stories about WMDs four years ago on the eve of the
[00:28:57.102 --> 00:28:57.602]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[00:28:57.623 --> 00:28:59.024]  I'm just calling from Vancouver.
[00:28:59.044 --> 00:29:02.366]  I've been watching about the Olympics that are going to happen here in a couple years.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:22.302]  I've noticed some things that have been fairly disturbing.
[00:29:22.402 --> 00:29:30.529]  I've been researching what you've been talking about for quite a few years, and I noticed that every time you find a new level, there's just another level underneath.
[00:29:31.729 --> 00:29:38.015]  There's massive global social planning going into the whole police state grid over society.
[00:29:38.575 --> 00:29:39.676]  Exactly, exactly.
[00:29:39.716 --> 00:29:42.518]  And I think I've found another little facet of that.
[00:29:42.658 --> 00:29:45.080]  It has to do with, have you heard of Cascadia?
[00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:47.042]  No, I haven't.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:30:01.688]  It's basically part of British Columbia, part of Seattle, Washington, and they want to turn it into a new province in the future, which I think might be the beginning of the North American Union.
[00:30:04.096 --> 00:30:05.678]  I don't think so.
[00:30:18.797 --> 00:30:22.460]  has basically ratified without Congress's approval.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.281]  They've ordered the bureaucracies to follow it.
[00:30:25.282 --> 00:30:32.547]  Bush, what Reagan took us out of, signed back on to the United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization, UNESCO.
[00:30:32.567 --> 00:30:40.833]  I remember he sent his wife two years ago over to France to sign back onto it, which then sets the policy through that treaty to
[00:30:41.873 --> 00:31:08.950]  order our entire society and under that there are buffer zones 75 miles on both sides of the Canadian and Mexican border that puts that into a type of multinational zone and yes I am aware that not just on the western border of Canada with the United States but across the entire border that that we see this munialization or this merger this integration it's all part of the North American Union
[00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.990]  Yes, exactly, sir.
[00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:16.212]  And it just feels to me this is sort of like how a boxer kind of slips the jab, you know what I mean?
[00:31:16.692 --> 00:31:31.996]  It just seems like this is how one of the methods they're going to use to slip the North American Union by saying, oh, it's about sports, it's about, you know, community, getting us together and that sort of thing, and then using it and twisting it into something that goes kind of what their agenda is all about.
[00:31:32.566 --> 00:31:44.750]  Well, I suggest you go to judicialwatch.org's website, WorldNetDaily, Associated Press, Human Events, all reported on it in January of this year.
[00:31:44.810 --> 00:31:54.374]  Just a few weeks ago, they finally got the FOIA request issued, complied with, by the State Department and the Justice Department.
[00:31:55.374 --> 00:32:03.856]  And that concerned a meeting in mid-September in the western area of Canada called the North American Union Summit.
[00:32:04.256 --> 00:32:06.557]  And we've got thousands of pages.
[00:32:06.637 --> 00:32:08.097]  I've read through hundreds of them now.
[00:32:08.137 --> 00:32:10.617]  I'm not going to lie to you and tell you I read them all.
[00:32:10.938 --> 00:32:12.858]  But Judicial Watch highlighted some of the key areas.
[00:32:12.898 --> 00:32:14.658]  Go read them on their website.
[00:32:14.718 --> 00:32:16.279]  It said we've got to do this by stealth.
[00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:18.679]  We've got to merge the countries of the North American Union.
[00:32:18.699 --> 00:32:21.660]  We've got to merge the military, the police, the trade.
[00:32:22.503 --> 00:32:32.792]  The regulations, and we can use the hoax of global warming to push a North American Union carbon tax to fund the North American Union.
[00:32:32.812 --> 00:32:35.294]  I mean, you ought to go read this stuff, okay?
[00:32:35.655 --> 00:32:38.037]  I mean, it is just incredible.
[00:32:38.564 --> 00:32:48.112]  And you had the heads of the state departments of all three countries, you had unelected people like George Shultz there, one of the big kingmakers, you had Mexican and Canadian officials and all these corporate chiefs.
[00:32:48.412 --> 00:32:56.198]  They're writing up the agreements because we were put into the North American Union in March of 2005 up at Crawford, Texas.
[00:32:56.218 --> 00:32:59.581]  It was in between Crawford and Waco, there at that Air Force base.
[00:33:00.221 --> 00:33:16.008]  Then Paul Martin, Prime Minister of Canada, and of course, Vicente Fox, the then President, and of course, the current President, George W. Bush, treasonously signed us into the North American Union, the Security and Prosperity Partnership, which clearly says, and by the way, we only got the first five pages.
[00:33:17.148 --> 00:33:21.310]  The entire agreement is not made public, and they said that that's classified.
[00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:30.138]  But now with four-year releases from meetings about the agreement, we know they are forming the North American Union right now.
[00:33:30.318 --> 00:33:32.039]  And again, Lou Dobbs is even covering it.
[00:33:32.459 --> 00:33:34.400]  I was a cook to talk about this ten years ago.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.161]  Now Lou Dobbs is covering it.
[00:33:37.901 --> 00:33:40.442]  Let's go ahead and talk to Julie.
[00:33:40.482 --> 00:33:43.163]  She's calling from San Antonio, Texas.
[00:33:43.443 --> 00:33:43.983]  You're on the air.
[00:33:44.063 --> 00:33:44.663]  Thanks for holding.
[00:33:45.704 --> 00:33:46.284]  Cuckoo.
[00:33:46.904 --> 00:33:47.564]  Footloops.
[00:33:48.245 --> 00:33:48.645]  Cuckoo.
[00:33:49.946 --> 00:33:51.148]  What do you want to say, Jacket?
[00:33:51.508 --> 00:33:51.989]  Cuckoo!
[00:34:00.422 --> 00:34:04.384]  And said, and told the call screener, you don't have to lie to get on air here, okay?
[00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:08.387]  On my weekday show, we just asked your name and where you're calling from.
[00:34:08.407 --> 00:34:17.652]  Here out of the KLBJ studios syndicating the Sunday show, you know, they ask what you want to talk about, but you can talk about whatever you want, and if you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[00:34:18.293 --> 00:34:20.714]  But if you just call in being stupid, we're going to hang up on you.
[00:34:21.224 --> 00:34:28.605]  I mean, you called into my show, what, Tuesday or Wednesday, and I let you go for like a minute or so saying cuckoo and Froot Loops over and over again.
[00:34:28.966 --> 00:34:31.366]  Specifically, what am I saying that isn't true?
[00:34:31.886 --> 00:34:34.467]  Specifically, what is it that we're making up?
[00:34:34.567 --> 00:34:36.447]  What is it we're saying that's crazy?
[00:34:37.627 --> 00:34:39.848]  The people who attack us don't have any information.
[00:34:40.148 --> 00:34:43.308]  They can't counter us in a substantive fashion.
[00:34:44.269 --> 00:34:45.909]  Let's go ahead and
[00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:50.172]  Talk to Keith in New Jersey.
[00:34:50.672 --> 00:34:51.952]  Keith, you're on the air.
[00:34:52.073 --> 00:34:52.853]  Thank you for holding.
[00:34:52.953 --> 00:34:53.293]  Welcome.
[00:34:53.913 --> 00:34:55.034]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:34:55.094 --> 00:34:57.275]  First of all, I'd like to say happy 33rd birthday.
[00:34:57.335 --> 00:34:58.736]  And no, that's not a Masonic code.
[00:34:59.416 --> 00:35:01.677]  I want to show you a couple of things that's real quick.
[00:35:02.290 --> 00:35:06.752]  Number one, I noticed you were talking about the whole Google thing, how they hide cameras and microphones.
[00:35:07.052 --> 00:35:07.813]  Well, they don't hide them.
[00:35:08.053 --> 00:35:14.616]  It's in almost all the new PCs and Macs, and most of the old ones, and it's a huge multi-hundred page report Google put out.
[00:35:14.636 --> 00:35:18.917]  Their stock went up, saying they're going to use the cameras and microphones to listen and record.
[00:35:18.978 --> 00:35:21.259]  If a dog's barking, you'll get ads for dog food.
[00:35:21.519 --> 00:35:23.159]  The computers can even recognize that.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:30.683]  Every word you're saying, what TV you're watching, to go into... I mean, people pay for that type of data, but again,
[00:35:31.323 --> 00:35:32.323]  This is just off the charts.
[00:35:32.723 --> 00:35:33.623]  Well, it's easy to disable.
[00:35:33.663 --> 00:35:35.384]  Number one, just put duct tape over the camera.
[00:35:35.404 --> 00:35:42.945]  Number two, if you have an old headphone, cut off the plug, plug it into the mic jack, and that'll disable the internal microphone.
[00:35:43.645 --> 00:35:45.626]  Another thing, a couple things I wanted to ask you.
[00:35:46.046 --> 00:35:51.187]  Number one, in your weekday show, you have this reggae song where the guy says, I'm not the senator's son.
[00:35:51.207 --> 00:35:52.407]  I wanted to know the name of the track.
[00:35:52.807 --> 00:35:58.708]  Number two, I wanted to know how do I contact other affiliates so I can get you on the East Coast because
[00:35:59.204 --> 00:36:01.446]  I have to either listen to the internet or call into your show.
[00:36:02.326 --> 00:36:09.292]  Number three, I was watching a while back a Disney show called Gargoyles where they talk about the Illuminati.
[00:36:09.772 --> 00:36:14.115]  One thing I couldn't understand, which I did kind of like, is the Shakespearean theme.
[00:36:14.556 --> 00:36:26.885]  It wasn't until I got a DVD from your website, Infowars.com, called America's Secret Destiny, that it finally made sense why they would talk about the Illuminati and then have a Shakespearean theme on top of that.
[00:36:27.899 --> 00:36:29.520]  Okay, a lot of questions there.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.841]  When we get back, I'll try to briefly answer them as best I can.
[00:36:34.861 --> 00:36:40.943]  Then we'll continue with your calls from around the country and the North American Union up into Canada.
[00:36:41.603 --> 00:36:44.284]  PrisonPlanet.com, JonesReport.com are the websites.
[00:36:44.584 --> 00:36:47.005]  We'll also cover looming World War III.
[00:36:47.025 --> 00:36:49.006]  That's what it could turn into with Iran.
[00:36:49.126 --> 00:36:49.766]  We'll be right back.
[00:37:00.691 --> 00:37:04.733]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[00:37:04.933 --> 00:37:08.334]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[00:37:08.514 --> 00:37:12.016]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[00:37:12.262 --> 00:37:15.464]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[00:37:15.484 --> 00:37:20.988]  The basic tenet of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the diseases that we've seen.
[00:37:21.028 --> 00:37:30.654]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jogs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[00:37:30.794 --> 00:37:32.075]  It's a well thought out formula.
[00:37:32.115 --> 00:37:37.559]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:42.504]  You'll find I think that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[00:37:42.524 --> 00:37:43.946]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[00:37:44.106 --> 00:37:47.590]  For more information call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.heartdrop.com.
[00:37:47.610 --> 00:37:48.591]  That toll free number again 1-877-928-8822.
[00:38:02.808 --> 00:38:03.528]  Pinch me, Bill.
[00:38:03.808 --> 00:38:04.749]  I can't believe it.
[00:38:05.169 --> 00:38:07.970]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:10.851]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:13.112]  I know what you mean, John.
[00:38:13.532 --> 00:38:17.233]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[00:38:17.813 --> 00:38:21.635]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:21.695 --> 00:38:23.275]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[00:38:23.756 --> 00:38:28.617]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[00:38:28.937 --> 00:38:30.018]  And I owe it all to you.
[00:38:30.598 --> 00:38:33.899]  Because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[00:38:33.979 --> 00:38:37.021]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[00:38:37.041 --> 00:38:38.361]  I want to tell everybody.
[00:38:38.581 --> 00:38:41.943]  Because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[00:38:42.323 --> 00:38:43.984]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[00:38:44.264 --> 00:38:46.905]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[00:38:47.045 --> 00:38:53.247]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[00:38:53.508 --> 00:38:54.348]  What a concept!
[00:39:03.792 --> 00:39:04.813]  Hey, it's me.
[00:39:05.073 --> 00:39:06.995]  I got something, man, I want you to look at.
[00:39:07.015 --> 00:39:07.736]  What?
[00:39:08.196 --> 00:39:08.917]  What is it now?
[00:39:09.357 --> 00:39:11.840]  It's called OneYearToRetire.net.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.103]  When you get home, I want you to go to OneYearToRetire.net.
[00:39:15.163 --> 00:39:16.524]  Come on, you gotta be kidding.
[00:39:16.965 --> 00:39:18.046]  One year to retire?
[00:39:18.286 --> 00:39:21.009]  When are you gonna get it through your head that there is no quick fix?
[00:39:21.369 --> 00:39:22.070]  No free lunch?
[00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:22.871]  I know.
[00:39:23.231 --> 00:39:23.992]  I agree with you.
[00:39:24.132 --> 00:39:25.073]  This isn't like that.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.263]  It's an ingenious system that's designed to help you retire in one year.
[00:39:29.283 --> 00:39:34.769]  I was skeptical too, but the system is free, and when I looked at it, I was sure it would work.
[00:39:35.389 --> 00:39:36.250]  What have you got to lose?
[00:39:36.290 --> 00:39:36.810]  It's free.
[00:39:37.251 --> 00:39:42.255]  Well... All you have to do is go to OneYearToRetire.net and get a free system.
[00:39:42.816 --> 00:39:43.817]  It only takes a minute.
[00:39:44.017 --> 00:39:46.179]  You've got nothing to lose and everything to gain.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.743]  Go to OneYearToRetire.net That's OneYearToRetire.net
[00:39:51.992 --> 00:39:52.453]  Or call 888-200-0265.
[00:39:52.514 --> 00:39:52.694]  That's 888-200-0265.
[00:40:02.443 --> 00:40:06.585]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[00:40:06.805 --> 00:40:08.566]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[00:40:08.826 --> 00:40:15.108]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[00:40:15.408 --> 00:40:21.531]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[00:40:21.771 --> 00:40:23.632]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[00:40:23.892 --> 00:40:24.252]  I think so.
[00:40:46.398 --> 00:40:48.839]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:41:13.648 --> 00:41:27.042]  Coming to you from the capital of Texas, broadcasting the truth coast to coast and worldwide, this is the Alex Jones Show!
[00:41:27.102 --> 00:41:35.070]  In the first 20 minutes of the show, of the broadcast, I was talking about the police state, the violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[00:41:35.942 --> 00:41:39.984]  And for those that don't like due process, for those that don't like the Bill of Rights, you're not an American.
[00:41:40.484 --> 00:41:42.085]  That's what makes America, America.
[00:41:42.465 --> 00:41:45.846]  Is our Constitution, our Bill of Rights, our Declaration of Independence.
[00:41:46.066 --> 00:41:47.527]  And I'm a Constitutionalist.
[00:41:47.707 --> 00:41:52.169]  I defend this country's sovereignty and what makes this nation great.
[00:41:52.749 --> 00:42:03.318]  And all I hear from Barack Obama and Newt Gingrich and Hillary Clinton and George Bush is violate the First Amendment, violate the Second Amendment, violate our Constitution, flush it down the toilet.
[00:42:03.759 --> 00:42:04.800]  And they're the problem.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.544]  And we need to reverse the New World Order stranglehold they have on this country and the world.
[00:42:10.322 --> 00:42:12.043]  Now, the last caller was asking about affiliates.
[00:42:12.444 --> 00:42:16.426]  I've only got about 63 stations currently during my weekday show.
[00:42:16.466 --> 00:42:21.730]  That sounds like a lot, and we reach a couple million people a day, and I'm very proud and blessed to do that.
[00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:23.811]  But it's what you'd call a medium-sized syndicated show.
[00:42:25.132 --> 00:42:33.918]  But of course, you've heard George Norrie on the show talk about how it is the number one show on the internet with Shoutcast and all the other big rating services.
[00:42:34.658 --> 00:42:36.180]  And the future is the Internet.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:40.043]  That's why PrisonPlanet.com is bigger than DallasMorningNews.com, RushLimbaugh.com.
[00:42:40.243 --> 00:42:42.565]  And I've got nine websites, folks, and all of them are huge.
[00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:46.689]  You asked about affiliates on the East Coast.
[00:42:46.709 --> 00:42:50.372]  I think we've only got like five affiliates so far in the last three or four months we've started this show.
[00:42:50.572 --> 00:42:51.293]  But that's really great.
[00:42:51.313 --> 00:42:53.895]  We've got, that is, five affiliates on the East Coast.
[00:42:53.996 --> 00:42:54.976]  It's a total of 14 stations.
[00:42:56.481 --> 00:43:01.046]  In the country and a bunch of others in the process of signing on to pick up the broadcast.
[00:43:01.066 --> 00:43:07.492]  So this is kind of a regional specialty show, but we're on from California to upstate New York, so I guess you really can't even call it regional.
[00:43:07.572 --> 00:43:10.094]  It's a growing, developing, syndicated program.
[00:43:10.114 --> 00:43:12.176]  But be glad you can listen on the web.
[00:43:12.216 --> 00:43:16.060]  I'm blessed that we're able to be on the web and reach millions of people every week over the internet.
[00:43:16.680 --> 00:43:23.903]  And we're also blessed that wireless in people's cars is now going to be standard in the next few years with the new cars.
[00:43:24.263 --> 00:43:34.668]  So you'll just be able to tune into the internet, radio, hear whatever you want, have millions of choices of whatever audio or music you want to listen to, talk radio, sports, you name it.
[00:43:34.988 --> 00:43:36.649]  That's the revolution that's taking place.
[00:43:36.689 --> 00:43:39.970]  In fact, near the end of the broadcast, in the second hour,
[00:43:40.811 --> 00:43:48.856]  I want to talk about some of the new developments in the explosion of the new media and what the establishment is doing to try to shut down and restrict the web.
[00:43:48.896 --> 00:43:50.997]  We've got several reports on that today.
[00:43:51.297 --> 00:43:52.398]  We'll be going over.
[00:43:52.758 --> 00:43:58.421]  To answer the caller's second question about occult symbolism in television and media.
[00:43:59.486 --> 00:44:00.107]  It's everywhere.
[00:44:00.167 --> 00:44:01.227]  Number one, it sells.
[00:44:01.447 --> 00:44:02.128]  People like it.
[00:44:03.149 --> 00:44:10.514]  Number two, there is an elite agenda with all of these symbols and this occultism, and it is very dominant in corporate America.
[00:44:10.574 --> 00:44:13.716]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the list goes on and on.
[00:44:14.076 --> 00:44:20.841]  And yeah, most children's programming you see, if you flip around the dial, it's just full of this occultic stuff, and I think it's very dangerous.
[00:44:21.428 --> 00:44:24.549]  And very, very damaging, and parents should be aware of that.
[00:44:24.609 --> 00:44:30.352]  I mean, the fastest growing religion in this country is the whole spectrum of the occult.
[00:44:30.932 --> 00:44:32.833]  And there's a thousand flavors of it, plus.
[00:44:34.394 --> 00:44:39.576]  I'm a Christian, and I just think it's terrible, but the churches in this country aren't really doing much to counter that.
[00:44:39.616 --> 00:44:42.117]  They're too busy warmongering for World War III.
[00:44:42.137 --> 00:44:44.458]  Alright, so many callers here.
[00:44:45.278 --> 00:44:49.140]  Who to go to next?
[00:44:49.787 --> 00:44:53.028]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Austin.
[00:44:53.228 --> 00:44:54.168]  Mike, you're on the air.
[00:44:54.248 --> 00:44:54.628]  Welcome.
[00:44:55.629 --> 00:44:55.989]  Hi, Alex.
[00:44:56.009 --> 00:44:59.330]  Thanks for taking my call today.
[00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:00.330]  I had a quick question.
[00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:02.250]  I told the screener briefly.
[00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:06.952]  I listen to a lot of talk radio on my headset at work.
[00:45:06.972 --> 00:45:11.053]  I have a little portable radio I put in my pocket, and I listen to all kinds of different talk radio.
[00:45:11.093 --> 00:45:19.015]  I've just heard snippets of Michael Savage, who, as a lot of people know, was one of the major drum beaters before the war.
[00:45:20.033 --> 00:45:37.483]  And now I've heard just snippets of him during the week where he's now coming out vehemently against troop escalation and against the President's policy and saying, this can't fix it, we need to think of something else, troop escalation isn't the answer.
[00:45:38.023 --> 00:45:47.328]  And I was wondering if you had any insight as to why someone like that, who was such a major drum-beater for the war, is now
[00:45:48.363 --> 00:45:58.471]  You know, on air saying people who oppose the government should be censored, should be locked away, is now such a, has done, it seems, at least to a certain extent, such a complete 180.
[00:45:59.171 --> 00:46:00.532]  Sure, sure, let me break that down.
[00:46:00.832 --> 00:46:01.953]  It's a very good question.
[00:46:02.774 --> 00:46:03.354]  Great call.
[00:46:04.615 --> 00:46:06.937]  I'm not in the business of bashing other talk show hosts.
[00:46:07.537 --> 00:46:15.864]  I love it when Limbaugh and Hannity and Neil Bortz now on a weekly basis spend, take time out to attack me.
[00:46:17.205 --> 00:46:17.565]  I love it.
[00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:24.322]  I mean, I consider myself a real bedrock, classical, paleo-conservative.
[00:46:24.642 --> 00:46:29.284]  And what you see as modern conservatives, there's no comparison.
[00:46:29.644 --> 00:46:31.705]  These are, in my opinion, not real conservatives.
[00:46:32.225 --> 00:46:36.907]  But of the lot, Michael Savage really has no redeeming values.
[00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:41.689]  And for people that are shocked by me saying that, you need to listen a little bit more carefully.
[00:46:43.627 --> 00:46:45.708]  Because, and first you need to investigate people.
[00:46:46.048 --> 00:46:52.792]  Can you imagine if I'd written a couple best-selling books as a beatnik in the 60s with things I can't even mention on the air?
[00:46:54.112 --> 00:46:55.053]  Can you imagine?
[00:46:55.773 --> 00:46:57.134]  I mean, this guy's got quite a history.
[00:46:57.274 --> 00:46:58.375]  I'm just going to leave it there, folks.
[00:46:58.435 --> 00:46:59.455]  It's unbelievable.
[00:47:00.016 --> 00:47:00.936]  That's all I'm going to say.
[00:47:01.736 --> 00:47:02.037]  Okay?
[00:47:02.157 --> 00:47:02.757]  I'm just going to leave it.
[00:47:02.837 --> 00:47:04.758]  It's just, you better do some looking around.
[00:47:06.027 --> 00:47:06.728]  About this guy.
[00:47:07.248 --> 00:47:13.851]  And I've heard him, I quit listening a few years ago, I mean I monitor talk radio to hear what's going on, so every once in a while I'll still tune in.
[00:47:14.791 --> 00:47:21.874]  But openly saying anyone who disagrees with the government is aiding terrorists, he's being put in a camp, and we shouldn't be fed unless we work.
[00:47:21.934 --> 00:47:23.655]  So he's for forced labor camps.
[00:47:23.955 --> 00:47:28.617]  Newt Gingrich is saying ban the First Amendment, restrict free speech, you shouldn't be able to be against the war.
[00:47:28.878 --> 00:47:29.738]  That's because they're losing.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:33.823]  78% of Americans in major polls, two major polls, this is 78.
[00:47:33.943 --> 00:47:36.325]  They're between 75 and 82 depending on the poll.
[00:47:36.345 --> 00:47:37.026]  So I just say 78.
[00:47:37.226 --> 00:47:43.552]  So I saw two major, one was Mason Dixon, another was Reuters, commissioned a poll by Zogby.
[00:47:43.692 --> 00:47:44.213]  But 78.
[00:47:45.594 --> 00:47:52.101]  70% a year ago the troops wanted to come home, now it's 75 in polls done by the BBC and other groups in Iraq.
[00:47:53.018 --> 00:48:07.545]  And so, you're going to see that type of flip-flopping as they realize that their entire conservative audience has figured out this war is bad for America, bad for the world, that it was built on a lie, and that it is just getting our troops killed for no good reason.
[00:48:07.965 --> 00:48:13.928]  And every major CIA report coming out says it actually escalates things to have 140,000, now they've gone up to 160-plus thousand troops there.
[00:48:19.202 --> 00:48:21.223]  So, and I've heard what he's saying.
[00:48:21.243 --> 00:48:22.684]  He says, let's just nuke them instead.
[00:48:22.764 --> 00:48:24.145]  Don't get our troops killed over there.
[00:48:24.645 --> 00:48:26.486]  Which is what Israel is actually starting to talk about.
[00:48:26.726 --> 00:48:27.507]  Yeah, nuclear war.
[00:48:27.527 --> 00:48:29.368]  Let's just preemptively start bombing people with nukes.
[00:48:29.648 --> 00:48:30.909]  You've all heard it on talk radio.
[00:48:30.929 --> 00:48:32.049]  Glass parking lot.
[00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:36.492]  They can't find Iraq on a map or Afghanistan on a map, but they can say glass parking lot.
[00:48:36.792 --> 00:48:41.275]  So they repeat it over and over again without looking at the global ramifications of the
[00:48:41.955 --> 00:48:47.197]  Socioeconomic ramifications at America's standing and what that'll do to the dollar.
[00:48:47.978 --> 00:48:53.000]  It's just, across the political spectrum, the gurus, the experts, everybody's saying don't do it.
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:56.521]  Now, somebody who is against the troop escalation is Oliver North.
[00:48:56.541 --> 00:48:57.422]  I've interviewed him many times.
[00:48:57.922 --> 00:49:05.065]  And he's saying, wait a minute, if we put 21,000 extra troops, and now Bush has said 40-plus thousand, it's actually going to be 20-plus thousand there supporting the 20,000 others.
[00:49:06.568 --> 00:49:14.353]  That if you put more troops in undefended little machine gun nests all over Baghdad and a few other cities, that it's going to rapidly escalate the number of dead troops.
[00:49:14.654 --> 00:49:18.496]  And a month into this escalation, huge increases, record levels.
[00:49:18.916 --> 00:49:22.519]  This is the highest level in the last three and a half plus years of dead troops.
[00:49:23.989 --> 00:49:25.790]  And the number of dead troops is really over 11,000.
[00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:28.570]  These are official numbers from last year.
[00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:29.611]  I'm sure they're much worse now.
[00:49:29.851 --> 00:49:32.151]  Because you have to die in country.
[00:49:32.571 --> 00:49:38.713]  If you're med-vac'ed into Rammstein in Germany or into England, and you die there, it doesn't count as a combat casualty.
[00:49:39.313 --> 00:49:40.414]  It counts as a complication.
[00:49:40.874 --> 00:49:43.234]  So it's 3,200 and something now.
[00:49:43.514 --> 00:49:44.755]  They're always messing with that number.
[00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:45.595]  Here's an example.
[00:49:46.475 --> 00:49:48.836]  The war in Vietnam and Indochina
[00:49:49.466 --> 00:49:54.427]  Backing up the French, this is mainstream history, just go look it up in the encyclopedia, really started in 1958.
[00:49:54.667 --> 00:49:56.367]  That's when U.S.
[00:49:56.387 --> 00:49:57.528]  advisors and backing started.
[00:49:57.848 --> 00:50:11.070]  The war didn't kick off, and it never got officially declared, but it didn't really kick off and wasn't called a war until 1964 and the stage, now declassified, Gulf of Tonkin, the government, LBJ staged an attack on our destroyers, now declassified.
[00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:18.492]  The tape's been released by the National Library, the Presidential Library and Museum here at UT in Austin.
[00:50:19.827 --> 00:50:27.932]  But between 58 and 64, in those six years, guess how many U.S.
[00:50:28.052 --> 00:50:29.593]  troops conservatively died?
[00:50:29.654 --> 00:50:30.314]  Last week I said 4,000.
[00:50:30.554 --> 00:50:31.935]  That didn't sound right.
[00:50:31.955 --> 00:50:32.435]  I was going from there.
[00:50:32.455 --> 00:50:34.056]  I went and looked it up.
[00:50:34.076 --> 00:50:42.342]  6,000 plus troops died in that six years, or roughly 1,000 a year, and they kept it completely secret.
[00:50:42.882 --> 00:50:46.445]  So, there's nothing new about this for propaganda purposes.
[00:50:46.905 --> 00:50:48.406]  And again, that's totally un-American.
[00:50:48.446 --> 00:50:50.888]  This stuff started in Vietnam.
[00:50:50.948 --> 00:50:58.414]  Look, remember two years ago, governmental accounting office, non-partisan, the headline 1.6 billion in fake news ruled illegal?
[00:50:58.975 --> 00:51:04.058]  The White House paying reporters to put out lies, paying for fake news, paying for propaganda.
[00:51:04.098 --> 00:51:04.599]  Remember that?
[00:51:04.639 --> 00:51:05.119]  Don't believe me?
[00:51:05.139 --> 00:51:07.681]  Type in 1.6 billion fake news into Google.
[00:51:07.701 --> 00:51:11.684]  You'll get Reuters, AP, Boston Globe, Washington Post, Washington Times.
[00:51:11.704 --> 00:51:12.405]  It was huge news.
[00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:16.111]  That is so un-American, that is so dangerous.
[00:51:16.311 --> 00:51:21.916]  So, the real number, 11,000 plus dead U.S.
[00:51:21.956 --> 00:51:22.277]  troops.
[00:51:22.937 --> 00:51:23.278]  Alright?
[00:51:23.958 --> 00:51:27.121]  And now that's accelerating with the troop escalation.
[00:51:27.722 --> 00:51:29.243]  Why did they escalate the troops?
[00:51:29.743 --> 00:51:32.166]  Why, when all the military advisors said don't do it?
[00:51:32.426 --> 00:51:33.807]  Why did Karl Rove cook it up?
[00:51:34.568 --> 00:51:37.430]  When we get back, I'll briefly describe and break down why.
[00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:38.111]  It's a stunt.
[00:51:38.877 --> 00:51:39.197]  Okay?
[00:51:39.597 --> 00:51:44.059]  And then we'll go to more of your calls and get into the latest Iraq and Iran news, I promise, in the next hour.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.960]  The future of the Internet and so much more.
[00:51:46.341 --> 00:51:46.981]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:51:47.001 --> 00:51:49.182]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:51:50.683 --> 00:51:51.604]  Hi, Ted Anderson here.
[00:51:51.624 --> 00:51:58.769]  I'm happy to announce that the audience has increased over 200% this year, and our advertisers have sent testimonials complimenting the responsiveness.
[00:51:59.029 --> 00:52:01.911]  Sponsorship is critical at both local and national levels.

[00:52:22.144 --> 00:52:23.145]  Looking for profits?
[00:52:23.225 --> 00:52:24.626]  Looking for safety and security?
[00:52:25.067 --> 00:52:28.169]  The $10 Olympic commemorative gold coin offers both.
[00:52:28.209 --> 00:52:35.775]  This low mintage collector coin with a total series mintage under $600,000 has sold at four times its current price.
[00:52:35.835 --> 00:52:39.558]  Falling dollar values and inflation make this likely to happen again.
[00:52:39.598 --> 00:52:41.119]  Secure your position today.

[00:52:50.913 --> 00:52:51.993]  Are you looking?

[00:53:13.158 --> 00:53:14.679]  He stands for what's right.
[00:53:15.099 --> 00:53:17.901]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:53:18.902 --> 00:53:21.883]  Call Alex now, toll free at 877-590-5525.
[00:53:22.264 --> 00:53:31.949]  Now live from Austin, Texas, here's Alex Jones.
[00:53:36.652 --> 00:53:38.353]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:38.553 --> 00:53:39.554]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:53:40.939 --> 00:53:54.127]  At the end of the last hour, we had a caller asking, why have all the military experts, all the analysts, even people that are pro-war, Oliver North, you name it, why are they saying, don't escalate the number of troops in Iraq?
[00:53:54.947 --> 00:53:55.688]  But Bush is.
[00:53:57.749 --> 00:53:58.769]  It makes more targets.
[00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:06.554]  You put 20,000 plus troops there, in asymmetrical warfare, it actually increases the insurgency.
[00:54:08.468 --> 00:54:10.990]  It actually angers the population to a greater level.
[00:54:11.511 --> 00:54:17.356]  It puts the troops in undefended sub-police stations all over those Iraqi cities, predominantly Baghdad.
[00:54:17.916 --> 00:54:20.038]  And sure enough, a month into this, the number of U.S.
[00:54:20.058 --> 00:54:25.543]  troops has ballooned to the highest number ever in a weekly average.
[00:54:26.704 --> 00:54:27.645]  Why did Bush do that?
[00:54:27.705 --> 00:54:28.466]  Well, it's simple.
[00:54:28.526 --> 00:54:30.968]  You've got the American people with a
[00:54:32.941 --> 00:54:41.465]  Basic landslide for the Democrats, who of course are even more pro-war in many cases than Bush, but with a mandate saying, get us out of Iraq.
[00:54:41.765 --> 00:54:43.506]  Almost 80% of Americans want us out.
[00:54:44.626 --> 00:54:45.627]  And what does Bush do?
[00:54:45.667 --> 00:54:46.867]  He increases the troops.
[00:54:46.967 --> 00:54:56.151]  So now the debate is about the 21,000, which they now admit is 40-plus thousand increase, instead about drawing down the troops and decreasing the numbers.
[00:54:56.171 --> 00:54:56.852]  So it's a trick.
[00:54:57.312 --> 00:55:01.614]  Now they debate the increase instead of debating a decrease.
[00:55:02.174 --> 00:55:03.455]  It's about escalation.
[00:55:03.875 --> 00:55:13.939]  The Pentagon plan from 2002, as reported by Reuters, the Israeli plan that was written off of from 1983, the official Israeli battle plan, was to have U.S.
[00:55:13.959 --> 00:55:27.744]  troops go into Iraq, break it into three parts, play the three racial, ethnic groups, slash religious groups, Shiite, Sunni, Kurd, off against each other, build permanent bases, which they've been doing,
[00:55:28.314 --> 00:55:30.376]  They're building over 30 giant bases.
[00:55:30.396 --> 00:55:32.157]  Some of them hold 6,000 people.
[00:55:32.177 --> 00:55:35.580]  They're building one in Baghdad that holds over 6,000 when it's done.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:37.221]  First it was 3,000, now they're saying 6,000.
[00:55:37.482 --> 00:55:39.483]  This permanent, quote, embassy.
[00:55:40.504 --> 00:55:45.949]  Official Pentagon plans say they'll be there in 30 years, but they lied and said the troops will be back by Christmas.
[00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:47.270]  It was another lie!
[00:55:47.630 --> 00:55:50.933]  Even if you're for this war, are you for always being lied to?
[00:55:52.814 --> 00:55:57.098]  So the troops have cynically, for political uses, been increased
[00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:03.993]  Knowing it'll kill more of them, knowing it'll actually make things degenerate, which is an excuse to stay there.
[00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:13.178]  The longer the troops stay there, the more money the defense contractors make, over $100 billion a year, and the more they can stir things up to widen the war.
[00:56:13.939 --> 00:56:21.463]  Now, I'm no fan of Iran, and in major polls, almost 70% of Iranians don't like the mullahs, and don't like Ahmadinejad.
[00:56:23.465 --> 00:56:25.367]  And he's in great danger of being overthrown.
[00:56:25.407 --> 00:56:31.974]  And there have been major reports, I'm sure you've seen them, it's been all over the news the last month that have come out, where all the analysts in the U.S.
[00:56:31.994 --> 00:56:45.187]  and the U.K., all of them, the CIA included, with their threat assessments are saying, if Ahmadinejad is attacked, that's the Iranian president, folks, who himself is a puppet, the Supreme Ayatollah really runs things there,
[00:56:46.068 --> 00:56:48.910]  If they're attacked, it will actually strengthen the hardliners.
[00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:54.954]  That's why the hardliners are saying, please attack us, please bomb us, doing everything they can to get attacked.
[00:56:55.614 --> 00:56:58.096]  Because it will actually strengthen their regime.
[00:56:59.417 --> 00:57:01.118]  And I don't want to hear they're going to have nukes.
[00:57:01.178 --> 00:57:08.122]  The CIA's assessment last year said that they wouldn't have a basic A-bomb, an atomic bomb, much less a hydrogen bomb, for ten years.
[00:57:08.162 --> 00:57:09.743]  So we've got nine more years.
[00:57:10.023 --> 00:57:13.946]  But let's take the Israeli estimate of four and a half to five years.
[00:57:15.692 --> 00:57:18.421]  All right, or the State Department assessment of seven years.
[00:57:19.344 --> 00:57:20.828]  Meanwhile, Pakistan...
[00:57:21.624 --> 00:57:26.748]  has a slew, a whole stable, of A-bombs and hydrogen bombs.
[00:57:27.328 --> 00:57:29.250]  We know North Korea's got some primitive weapons.
[00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:31.351]  China openly threatens to nuke us.
[00:57:31.411 --> 00:57:32.432]  Oh, you didn't know about that?
[00:57:32.732 --> 00:57:33.613]  Just type into Google.
[00:57:34.294 --> 00:57:39.277]  Last year, their head general, their supreme military commander, called a press conference one morning.
[00:57:39.337 --> 00:57:47.684]  Over a hundred Western media, Wall Street Journal, BBC, ABC News, most of them didn't even run with it, but it was in hundreds of papers, especially in Asia.
[00:57:47.964 --> 00:57:49.425]  They said, here's a big map
[00:57:50.265 --> 00:57:51.165]  And we've got 214 U.S.
[00:57:51.205 --> 00:57:52.766]  cities targeted.
[00:57:52.966 --> 00:57:55.607]  We will kill more than half your population.
[00:57:56.067 --> 00:58:01.228]  We have Long March Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles with hundreds of warheads.
[00:58:02.109 --> 00:58:08.511]  Over 50 of the missiles, each warhead 12-24, each missile with over 12-24 warheads in its MERV package.
[00:58:08.691 --> 00:58:15.413]  When it comes back into the atmosphere, the nose cone pops off on the second or third stage, depending on the missile they're using, and 12-24 weapons
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:26.582]  A lot of times it's half real warheads, half dummies to fool the SDI, Directed Energy Weapons and Missile Systems, Anti-Missile Systems.
[00:58:27.162 --> 00:58:33.504]  So we have a country with a billion, three hundred million population, a bigger economy than the U.S.
[00:58:33.544 --> 00:58:34.464]  It's now surpassed us.
[00:58:34.764 --> 00:58:36.264]  It holds one trillion in U.S.
[00:58:36.304 --> 00:58:37.564]  debt and U.S.T.
[00:58:37.604 --> 00:58:42.485]  bills, openly threatening to nuke the United States.
[00:58:44.266 --> 00:58:44.786]  Not a threat.
[00:58:45.419 --> 00:58:51.802]  But then we have Ahmadinejad, who has nothing.
[00:58:52.423 --> 00:58:59.306]  And they're talking about using bunker-busting mini-nukes, tactical nukes on them, and talking about our troops invading the western area of Iraq.
[00:58:59.726 --> 00:59:05.289]  Look, the neocons, the globals, the Democratic Party, the corporations that own this nation, want war.
[00:59:06.047 --> 00:59:07.328]  They want World War III.
[00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:18.939]  They financed the previous wars to consolidate, to have huge calamities, to get us into a war with Iran, so we start losing, even worse than we're losing now, so there will be a massive escalation.
[00:59:19.179 --> 00:59:21.181]  That's why they've got draft bills reintroduced.
[00:59:21.402 --> 00:59:23.043]  That's why they've got all this set up.
[00:59:24.364 --> 00:59:25.185]  And it's horrible.
[00:59:28.108 --> 00:59:30.230]  And that's my bottom line on that.
[00:59:31.275 --> 00:59:34.097]  Let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[00:59:34.117 --> 00:59:36.978]  I want to hurry through them now, then I want to get into the new information on Iran.
[00:59:38.179 --> 00:59:49.565]  Meet the new propaganda, same as the old propaganda about how they're supposedly, they've tracked the C4 chemical derivative and they say it matches with some of the C4 being produced in Iran.
[00:59:50.106 --> 00:59:52.087]  And so there you go, we've got to attack them.
[00:59:53.502 --> 00:59:55.923]  Right when the fleets of carriers are ready to attack.
[00:59:55.983 --> 00:59:57.144]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:59:57.184 --> 00:59:58.084]  We'll break it down later.
[00:59:58.444 --> 00:59:59.825]  Who's been holding the longest here?
[01:00:01.105 --> 01:00:05.827]  Let's go ahead and talk to TJ in Wisconsin.
[01:00:06.567 --> 01:00:08.628]  And thank you for calling, sir.
[01:00:09.048 --> 01:00:10.189]  You are on the air.
[01:00:11.029 --> 01:00:11.710]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:00:11.790 --> 01:00:13.090]  I called in to wish you a happy birthday.
[01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.011]  I know it's your 33rd.
[01:00:14.491 --> 01:00:15.031]  Well, thank you.
[01:00:15.851 --> 01:00:16.972]  I was on the line.
[01:00:17.072 --> 01:00:17.672]  I was listening to you.
[01:00:17.712 --> 01:00:19.433]  You reminded me when you brought up the police state.
[01:00:19.493 --> 01:00:22.434]  Now, I know you've been to New York, and I just moved out to Wisconsin from New York.
[01:00:23.132 --> 01:00:29.314]  Ever since 9-11, New York City has military in the city doing the job of New York City Police Officer.
[01:00:29.354 --> 01:00:36.755]  Hey listen, I had regular Army on video, it's on YouTube, we put it up for free, at the 9-11 Remembrance in September.
[01:00:36.895 --> 01:00:42.997]  We're at By Madison Square Garden, we're just videotaping crowds, and troops run up screaming saying, turn your cameras off!
[01:00:43.177 --> 01:00:44.457]  And I said, no, it's America!
[01:00:44.837 --> 01:00:45.938]  Go ahead and do whatever you're going to do!
[01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:50.939]  And I had cameras on the balcony of a restaurant, my guys were out shooting me down the street, and
[01:00:52.123 --> 01:00:53.707]  I am screaming and cussing, U.S.
[01:00:53.747 --> 01:00:54.508]  military troops.
[01:00:56.232 --> 01:01:03.307]  That's not a free society, folks, in banana boat republics, in third world dictatorships, in armpits.
[01:01:03.866 --> 01:01:06.187]  You have troops running around acting like this.
[01:01:06.227 --> 01:01:07.607]  We should be so ashamed.
[01:01:08.067 --> 01:01:12.488]  And now, 20% of the Army ground force in Iraq are illegal aliens hired by our government.
[01:01:12.848 --> 01:01:17.490]  Now they've announced that by 2010, they want to have half the ground force be foreigners.
[01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:21.151]  They've expanded the huge recruiting offices all over the third world.
[01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:22.391]  And we will have a government
[01:01:23.081 --> 01:01:32.010]  With foreign troops oppressing the American people and the New York Daily News reported what last week that from 2002 they had 99,000 stops and frisks and now it was 500 plus thousand in 2000
[01:01:38.977 --> 01:01:40.659]  And I've been there.
[01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:43.281]  I mean, they just randomly stop and search everybody.
[01:01:43.301 --> 01:01:44.623]  It has nothing to do with fighting terror.
[01:01:44.863 --> 01:01:46.384]  It's about you knowing you're a slave.
[01:01:46.645 --> 01:01:52.370]  There have been reports where a pregnant woman sits down on the sidewalk because she's going into labor.
[01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:54.612]  They arrest her, saying you're not allowed to sit on the edge.
[01:01:55.133 --> 01:01:57.215]  You sit too long on a bench, they arrest you.
[01:01:57.535 --> 01:01:59.237]  It's called maximum enforcement.
[01:01:59.957 --> 01:02:01.478]  They're banning trans fats.
[01:02:01.498 --> 01:02:03.799]  They're trying to ban smoking in your own house.
[01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:09.901]  Just all of this nanny state literally hanging over you, letting you know government's boss, government's God.
[01:02:10.341 --> 01:02:13.043]  Meanwhile, all these other crimes are being committed everywhere.
[01:02:15.784 --> 01:02:16.844]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:02:16.864 --> 01:02:17.424]  Good to hear from you.
[01:02:17.444 --> 01:02:20.466]  Thanks for the good wish there for the birthday.
[01:02:20.646 --> 01:02:20.926]  Kevin?
[01:02:21.813 --> 01:02:22.874]  Tony, Scott, and others.
[01:02:23.334 --> 01:02:24.714]  You're straight ahead on the other side.
[01:02:25.234 --> 01:02:28.516]  Then I'll get in to the latest developments on Target Iran.
[01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:30.477]  Will it kick off World War III?
[01:02:30.657 --> 01:02:32.277]  We're living in very perilous times.
[01:02:32.637 --> 01:02:33.898]  Most people are asleep right now.
[01:02:33.938 --> 01:02:34.858]  Hey, the Democrats won.
[01:02:34.898 --> 01:02:35.319]  We're safe.
[01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:36.299]  Everything's fine.
[01:02:36.779 --> 01:02:41.201]  That pack of criminals works for the very same global corporations that are not free market.
[01:02:41.401 --> 01:02:43.102]  They're trying to set up a world dictatorship.
[01:02:44.162 --> 01:02:45.103]  We're in worse trouble.
[01:02:45.343 --> 01:02:45.983]  We'll be right back.
[01:02:55.430 --> 01:03:00.894]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:01.274 --> 01:03:08.899]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:03:09.597 --> 01:03:16.662]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:03:17.062 --> 01:03:28.510]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:03:28.791 --> 01:03:32.293]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:03:32.753 --> 01:03:34.695]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:03:35.015 --> 01:03:38.878]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:03:47.284 --> 01:03:48.385]  Ted Anders from Hermidas.
[01:03:48.465 --> 01:03:48.706]  February 9, 2007.
[01:03:48.766 --> 01:03:49.827]  Gold is at $660.70.
[01:03:49.927 --> 01:03:52.228]  Onscore coins are $682.07, $343.59 for half, $171.79 for quarter.
[01:03:52.248 --> 01:03:52.609]  That's $682.07, $343.59 and $171.79.
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:09.142]  1971, Nixon closes the gold window.
[01:04:09.202 --> 01:04:10.062]  Fiat currency.
[01:04:10.823 --> 01:04:14.646]  1920s, the German market explodes from 75 to 23 trillion.
[01:04:14.966 --> 01:04:17.908]  1995, gold doubles against the Mexican peso.
[01:04:17.928 --> 01:04:21.110]  1997, gold increases 82% over the Indonesian rupee.
[01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:23.552]  1998, gold jumps two-thirds over the Russian ruble.
[01:04:24.413 --> 01:04:27.115]  2002, the Argentine peso loses a fifth of its value to gold.
[01:04:27.135 --> 01:04:32.518]  2006, the last superpower, the USA's mighty dollar, loses over half to gold and other raw goods.
[01:04:32.679 --> 01:04:33.939]  Could government let this happen?
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.021]  Without immediate backing, how much will it lose?
[01:04:36.281 --> 01:04:43.312]  Midas has Nick Bereshov's report covering the loss of purchasing power, fat tail events, bull market economic vulnerabilities, and gold-oil relationship.
[01:04:43.352 --> 01:04:45.054]  You've lost half of your purchasing power.
[01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.056]  Call 800-686-2237 before the rest disappears.
[01:04:46.076 --> 01:04:46.296]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:04:52.975 --> 01:04:55.676]  Do you owe back taxes to the IRS or to the state?
[01:04:56.216 --> 01:04:57.596]  You are not alone.
[01:04:58.157 --> 01:05:01.818]  Nationwide tax relief is here and we can get you a fresh start.
[01:05:02.378 --> 01:05:07.320]  I'm Richard Boggs, founder and CEO of one of the largest tax resolution firms in the country.

[01:05:24.433 --> 01:05:29.921]  If you owe more than $20,000 in any IRS or state taxes, you've got a serious tax problem.
[01:05:30.322 --> 01:05:31.283]  So get serious.
[01:05:31.584 --> 01:05:32.926]  Call Nationwide Tax Relief.

[01:05:44.678 --> 01:05:44.919]  That's 1-800-958-2677.
[01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:54.866]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?
[01:05:55.226 --> 01:06:02.209]  Since January of 2006, RxDrugCard.com members have saved an average of $33 per prescription filled.
[01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:03.670]  That's over 46% savings!
[01:06:04.070 --> 01:06:06.351]  The average savings for generic drugs was over 71%.
[01:06:08.212 --> 01:06:16.643]  RxDrugCard.com is the only major discount prescription drug plan that offers a price lookup page so you can get an idea of your discounted price before you enroll.
[01:06:16.943 --> 01:06:20.227]  RxDrugCard.com is for anyone who pays for their own prescriptions.

[01:06:54.099 --> 01:06:55.960]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:06:57.701 --> 01:07:03.905]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:07:04.025 --> 01:07:05.726]  Raging for the truth.
[01:07:05.926 --> 01:07:07.407]  Exposing corruption.
[01:07:07.988 --> 01:07:11.430]  Dismantling a false left-right paradigm.
[01:07:11.590 --> 01:07:13.951]  He's Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.312 --> 01:07:21.476]  By the way, if you disagree with anything I've said here today, if you disagree, you go to the head of the line.
[01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:27.914]  Unlike a lot of syndicated shows, or even local shows around the country, where they censor out people that disagree, I want it.
[01:07:28.355 --> 01:07:33.198]  I want to expose the ideas of people out there that are wrong.
[01:07:33.398 --> 01:07:34.619]  Or, who knows, you might be right.
[01:07:35.079 --> 01:07:36.360]  I don't plan to have all the answers.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:36.661]  877-590-5525.
[01:07:36.681 --> 01:07:37.061]  That's 877-590-5525.
[01:07:37.121 --> 01:07:37.201]  Or 836-0590.
[01:07:37.221 --> 01:07:39.703]  We really are on the edge of going into World War III.
[01:07:39.743 --> 01:07:41.404]  And I want to break that down in some detail.
[01:07:41.424 --> 01:07:42.425]  I don't have much time left.
[01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:54.376]  In the two segments after this one and some of the new developments and we will do that.
[01:07:54.716 --> 01:07:56.579]  But right now let's go back to your calls.
[01:07:56.599 --> 01:07:59.162]  The local number is 836-059.
[01:07:59.402 --> 01:08:01.665]  Let's see who's been holding the longest here.
[01:08:02.466 --> 01:08:06.972]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tony in Arlington and Tony you're on the air.
[01:08:07.052 --> 01:08:07.653]  Thanks for holding.
[01:08:09.039 --> 01:08:10.059]  Hey Alex, happy birthday!
[01:08:10.259 --> 01:08:13.640]  Thank you, everybody keeps... I shouldn't have let folks know it was my birthday, but thank you.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:17.201]  Real quick, I know we're in a hurry, Alex.
[01:08:17.441 --> 01:08:19.021]  I want to talk about Dennis Kucinich.
[01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:32.623]  January 27th, at a peace rally, he admittedly made a comment about looking into the truth of 9-11, and I guess since then he's backtracked, and I wanted to ask your opinion on that and reason for the backpedaling.
[01:08:33.003 --> 01:08:35.724]  Also, do you see anything
[01:08:36.474 --> 01:08:48.383]  In regards to another C-SPAN event, like the Scholar's 9-11 Truth, when you basically hosted that, that was great, and I wanted to get your opinion on it, if you think you'd be able to put that together.
[01:08:48.403 --> 01:09:01.532]  And the last thing, do you ever foresee basically Terror, Storm, or Martial Law on the big screen, like a nationwide mainstream film?
[01:09:01.712 --> 01:09:02.653]  Because I think that really
[01:09:03.379 --> 01:09:03.819]  I hear you.
[01:09:03.839 --> 01:09:04.259]  Good questions.
[01:09:04.279 --> 01:09:05.380]  Let me answer the second question first.
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:07.800]  Terror Storm has been in quite a few theaters around the country.
[01:09:23.647 --> 01:09:26.069]  And Marshall Law aired in a lot of theaters as well.
[01:09:27.130 --> 01:09:30.472]  My new film that I'm working on will be ready at the end of the summer.
[01:09:30.552 --> 01:09:34.995]  We do intend to have open up in maybe 10-15 cities around the country.
[01:09:35.356 --> 01:09:43.982]  But I'll be honest with you, quite frankly, just so folks get to come to the premieres and for the media reviews and attention that that will cause to the DVD release.
[01:09:44.022 --> 01:09:49.646]  And Terror Storm, my latest film, went to number 8 a few months ago and it's been in the top couple hundred ever since.
[01:09:50.646 --> 01:10:00.330]  And spent weeks and weeks in the top 20 at Amazon.com, the history of government-sponsored terror, TerrorStorm, which is very well documented.
[01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:06.272]  But I am working behind the scenes a little bit, I guess in an advisory consulting.
[01:10:07.472 --> 01:10:10.673]  I'm consulting a little bit on the script and things, but I'm not really at liberty to talk about that.
[01:10:10.953 --> 01:10:17.096]  I'm really honored that I've even been invited to be involved by the Loose Change crew and some other people that are involved with it out in Hollywood.
[01:10:17.636 --> 01:10:18.196]  One of the biggest
[01:10:19.248 --> 01:10:20.709]  Uh, mid-level studios.
[01:10:20.749 --> 01:10:24.151]  I mean, it's a Class A studio, but it's one of the new ones that's emerged in the last five, six years.
[01:10:24.391 --> 01:10:25.132]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:10:25.152 --> 01:10:28.073]  Let's just say a big dot-com billionaire started it.
[01:10:28.333 --> 01:10:29.594]  I'm gonna leave it at that, okay?
[01:10:29.754 --> 01:10:30.775]  I'm really not gonna talk about it.
[01:10:31.395 --> 01:10:37.419]  Uh, there's a good chance in the next four or five months, maybe even sooner, you're gonna see Loose Change, you know, putting in maybe a thousand screens.
[01:10:37.439 --> 01:10:41.821]  That's a major Class A opening, and a bunch of my footage is in it, and I'm just so honored.
[01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:44.863]  I know the Loose Change crew religiously listens in upstate New York.
[01:10:45.661 --> 01:10:46.982]  And I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:10:47.002 --> 01:10:50.905]  I don't want to get off into big screen movie talk all day.
[01:10:51.425 --> 01:10:55.668]  Of course, I'm in the film Scanner Darkly with Keanu Reeves, Renona Ryder and Woody Harrelson and others.
[01:10:55.728 --> 01:10:56.829]  And I'm also in Waking Life.
[01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:58.130]  But that's a separate deal.
[01:10:58.270 --> 01:10:59.551]  Richard Linklater, great director.
[01:10:59.571 --> 01:11:01.132]  Austin Knight, good friend of mine.
[01:11:01.632 --> 01:11:05.915]  But I don't really ever try to get in these movies or do these things.
[01:11:05.956 --> 01:11:07.076]  It just falls in my lap.
[01:11:07.116 --> 01:11:09.038]  So hey, I take it and I do it.
[01:11:09.078 --> 01:11:15.062]  And I've been lucky, blessed enough to be in two films, two major, one put out by Fox Searchlight, the other by Warner Brothers.
[01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.760]  I'm a workaholic, folks.
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:18.560]  I make documentary films.
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.901]  I've written a book.
[01:11:20.941 --> 01:11:22.522]  I've made 15 documentaries.
[01:11:22.542 --> 01:11:23.722]  I do talk radio.
[01:11:38.668 --> 01:11:51.980]  And, of course, do a lot of other things, run a bunch of big news websites, because I want to defend this republic, and I want to shift out of the left-right paradigm into the liberty versus tyranny paradigm, the real paradigm that actually counts.
[01:11:52.961 --> 01:11:54.242]  And then what was his other question?
[01:11:54.302 --> 01:11:58.046]  I have to keep asking the guys in there today, because I'm a bit dingy for some reason.
[01:11:58.606 --> 01:12:00.167]  He had a... Yeah, C-SPAN!
[01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:13.638]  Yeah, C-SPAN aired our two-hour 9-11 Neocon Agenda Symposium an unprecedented four times, and it got a huge viewership because by the third and fourth showings, four days in a row, it just built and built and built.
[01:12:13.678 --> 01:12:21.163]  C-SPAN has said on their website it was the most viewed, most ordered program they've ever had.
[01:12:22.265 --> 01:12:23.866]  Okay, so we broke the mold there.
[01:12:23.886 --> 01:12:26.847]  And there have been a few little 9-11 events that have aired on C-SPAN.
[01:12:26.867 --> 01:12:30.629]  They just haven't gotten the attention or they haven't been aired four times.
[01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:34.811]  There is the equivalent of their Frontline or Nightline.
[01:12:35.231 --> 01:12:43.415]  It's the main BBC channel in the UK, aired in several hundred countries, including some cable systems and satellite systems here in the US.
[01:12:44.036 --> 01:12:49.788]  It is a, what, two-hour special that's going to be airing consecutively the next two Sundays on BBC in the UK.
[01:12:50.149 --> 01:12:54.158]  And the intro, the ad they're running for it, I forget the name of it.
[01:12:55.205 --> 01:12:58.286]  Remember the BBC six months ago, or four or five months ago, when we first started this show?
[01:12:58.726 --> 01:13:01.146]  When we were just developing it for syndication, it was in studio here.
[01:13:01.567 --> 01:13:07.108]  They followed me around for like a week, and it's a big, big program, and you might be able to watch that coming up next week.
[01:13:07.168 --> 01:13:11.329]  It's Sunday night in the UK, and then it'll air in the next week here in the US.
[01:13:11.369 --> 01:13:18.290]  But I don't want to spend all day talking about myself, but it is important that it's coming out, so I hope that answers your question.
[01:13:18.851 --> 01:13:23.432]  Okay, now let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Boston, Mass.
[01:13:23.472 --> 01:13:24.152]  Thanks for holding.
[01:13:24.172 --> 01:13:24.712]  You're on the air.
[01:13:25.436 --> 01:13:27.237]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:13:27.477 --> 01:13:54.144]  There's a photo that's not a new photo, but it's not been seen by most Americans, and I think it's... I was hoping to get your reaction, because I believe this photo is devastating in a way of giving an argument to link all the way back to Castro, the Bay of Pigs, the JFK assassination, the Vietnam, the Laos drug running, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Meena Clinton's Arkansas drug running,
[01:13:54.665 --> 01:13:59.593]  Right up through 9-11 and Gary Webb's murder.
[01:14:00.209 --> 01:14:02.170]  And this election with Bush and Clinton.
[01:14:03.051 --> 01:14:08.114]  Well, the Bushes and the Clintons have worked together since Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar.
[01:14:08.414 --> 01:14:09.715]  He's a CIA operative.
[01:14:10.115 --> 01:14:12.657]  The 1992 election was completely staged.
[01:14:13.037 --> 01:14:18.781]  And I've interviewed scores of top DEA and CIA officers who were at MENA and saw Bill Clinton there.
[01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.242]  And it goes on and on.
[01:14:21.282 --> 01:14:21.983]  They've named names.
[01:14:22.043 --> 01:14:22.783]  It's on record.
[01:14:23.043 --> 01:14:25.525]  It's even been on Discovery Channel and History Channel.
[01:14:25.685 --> 01:14:27.246]  And it's just off the charts.
[01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:28.287]  It's totally staged.
[01:14:29.207 --> 01:14:32.289]  Look at Rupert Murdoch being behind the Hillary campaign.
[01:14:32.309 --> 01:14:34.331]  He's been behind her secretly for at least five years.
[01:14:34.711 --> 01:14:35.472]  Roger Ailes.
[01:14:36.293 --> 01:14:37.674]  This is a government operation.
[01:14:38.494 --> 01:14:42.437]  Look at how we have Bush Sr.
[01:14:42.457 --> 01:14:44.179]  calling Bill Clinton his surrogate son.
[01:14:44.219 --> 01:14:47.341]  They vacation together just like they vacationed with the Bin Ladens.
[01:14:48.093 --> 01:14:50.615]  That's FBI agent Robert Wright and Judicial Watch on record.
[01:14:50.795 --> 01:14:52.556]  We've been threatened with arrest, we'll tell you what we know.
[01:14:53.216 --> 01:14:57.979]  At the National Press Club they said, on C-SPAN, here's a letter, we'll be arrested, we'll tell you what we know.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.042]  All we can tell you is, the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[01:15:04.503 --> 01:15:06.485]  Again, folks, it's so bad.
[01:15:07.185 --> 01:15:08.766]  Things are so out of control.
[01:15:09.086 --> 01:15:11.127]  We have a global mafia running things.
[01:15:12.548 --> 01:15:13.449]  I mean, do you think the biggest
[01:15:14.221 --> 01:15:16.043]  Here's Putin saying, Putin says the U.S.
[01:15:16.063 --> 01:15:17.044]  wants to dominate the world.
[01:15:17.384 --> 01:15:18.365]  You got it wrong, Putin.
[01:15:18.606 --> 01:15:23.971]  The global corporations that control America want to use us to dominate the world for them.
[01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:30.798]  While they're busy funding terror groups to create the pretext
[01:15:32.077 --> 01:15:34.861]  To have this global domination and invasion.
[01:15:35.422 --> 01:15:39.848]  Alright, my websites again are JonesReport.com, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:44.595]  We'll continue with calls and get into the kickoff of World War III that could be coming up on the other side.

[01:17:52.578 --> 01:17:53.139]  Hi, Michelle.
[01:17:53.179 --> 01:17:54.520]  I haven't seen you on the bus for a while.
[01:17:54.841 --> 01:17:55.862]  Did they change your shift?
[01:17:56.042 --> 01:17:56.543]  No, Lori.
[01:17:56.823 --> 01:17:58.064]  I finally quit my job.
[01:17:58.325 --> 01:18:00.507]  I'm working at home now, and I love it.
[01:18:00.908 --> 01:18:01.809]  No more commuting.
[01:18:02.269 --> 01:18:04.492]  And I'm home when the kids get out of school.
[01:18:04.652 --> 01:18:05.513]  Working at home?
[01:18:05.913 --> 01:18:06.534]  Doing what?
[01:18:06.834 --> 01:18:07.755]  It's a long story.
[01:18:08.056 --> 01:18:11.139]  It all started when I discovered the website EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:18:12.961 --> 01:18:16.463]  Oh, Michelle, you didn't fall for one of those internet deals, did you?
[01:18:16.664 --> 01:18:19.666]  Well, I looked into several, and this one is for real.
[01:18:19.966 --> 01:18:20.906]  Are you sure?
[01:18:21.086 --> 01:18:26.170]  I didn't quit my job until I was sure, and now I'm making way more money working at home.
[01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.750]  Really?
[01:18:26.970 --> 01:18:30.513]  I've joined the Success Team and their major advertising co-op.
[01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:35.216]  Our business is fully automated, which gives me more money and the time to enjoy it.
[01:18:35.496 --> 01:18:37.577]  I'll be earning money while we're skiing this winter.
[01:18:37.738 --> 01:18:38.898]  What was that website again?
[01:18:39.058 --> 01:18:40.479]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:18:40.559 --> 01:18:41.640]  Here, write it down.
[01:18:42.861 --> 01:18:43.442]  Good idea!
[01:18:43.822 --> 01:18:46.024]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com.
[01:18:46.304 --> 01:18:48.066]  Maybe we can go skiing this winter, too.
[01:18:48.326 --> 01:18:51.269]  EarnMoneyAtHome123.com is a global opportunity.
[01:18:51.889 --> 01:18:57.915]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:18:58.476 --> 01:19:00.998]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American economy.
[01:19:03.769 --> 01:19:04.150]  I don't know.
[01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.569]  I think so.
[01:19:56.401 --> 01:20:00.643]  You're listening to GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:20:03.464 --> 01:20:06.486]  Corruption never had a worse enemy.
[01:20:07.286 --> 01:20:09.487]  You're locked into the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:12.336 --> 01:20:18.639]  Alright, let me cover some news I promised to get to, then we'll go to Scott and John and Mark and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:20:18.839 --> 01:20:20.700]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-590-5525.
[01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:27.984]  That's 877-590-KLBJ after our alma mater, I guess, where we broadcast out of here.
[01:20:28.004 --> 01:20:29.864]  NewsRadio 590-KLBJ.
[01:20:30.505 --> 01:20:33.886]  Local number here in Centrale, Texas, 836-0590.
[01:20:35.107 --> 01:20:36.928]  I could spend a whole show on this, but
[01:20:37.805 --> 01:20:39.887]  We don't really have any real manufacturing.
[01:20:40.387 --> 01:20:43.810]  It's a shadow of what it was 50 years ago, 30 years ago, even 10 years ago.
[01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:48.254]  Well, they told us that we'd be a service economy, but even that is constricting.
[01:20:48.734 --> 01:20:51.657]  But the mainstream media is always telling us how great the economy is.
[01:20:51.697 --> 01:20:54.399]  They use all these phony numbers about unemployment.
[01:20:54.459 --> 01:20:57.742]  They don't even count those that have been off the rolls for six months or longer.
[01:20:57.762 --> 01:21:02.405]  They only put winners in the S&P and the NASDAQ and the Dow Jones Industrial 30.
[01:21:03.827 --> 01:21:06.509]  The dollar has been devalued by close to 50 percent.
[01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:11.393]  It moved between 47 and 50 percent in the last few months against the Euro.
[01:21:11.694 --> 01:21:15.858]  Even worse shape against British sterling, the strongest currency in the world, and it should be.
[01:21:15.878 --> 01:21:20.842]  That's where the globalist crime syndicate, those that rule us, are based.
[01:21:21.663 --> 01:21:29.430]  You have to understand, the same people getting rid of our borders, the same people setting up the North American Union, the same elites that are dismantling our Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:42.155]  Are the folks that have set up a financial system that has the corporate system, the private systems, the city, county, state, and federal at the highest debt ratios ever.
[01:21:42.956 --> 01:21:51.439]  Meanwhile, every other major institution, governmental institution, including universities, keeps a double set of books which is primarily in stocks and bonds investments.
[01:21:52.379 --> 01:21:54.760]  And it's called the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.121]  You want to go down the rabbit hole deep, look into that.
[01:21:58.303 --> 01:22:01.946]  But this is the Associated Press.
[01:22:02.266 --> 01:22:05.749]  2006 personal savings dropped to 74 year low.
[01:22:05.889 --> 01:22:14.776]  People once again spent everything they made and then some last year pushing the personal savings rate to the lowest level since the Great Depression more than seven decades ago.
[01:22:14.836 --> 01:22:23.023]  In fact it beat that number from late 1933 at the worst point during the Great Depression.
[01:22:23.563 --> 01:22:25.244]  And where does this quote debt come from?
[01:22:25.284 --> 01:22:27.206]  The private run-for-profit Federal Reserve
[01:22:28.109 --> 01:22:28.449]  I don't know.
[01:22:45.979 --> 01:22:51.624]  Into a bank, they get to loan out on average with fractional reserve banking ten times that amount.
[01:22:52.024 --> 01:23:00.091]  So that's why when you're broke and poor, they send you a credit card every week in the mail, but once you're out of debt, you don't get credit cards sent to you maybe once or twice a year.
[01:23:01.132 --> 01:23:05.376]  I mean, I've had credit cards before that I didn't use or that I paid off immediately, and they said, we're canceling you.
[01:23:05.596 --> 01:23:06.377]  And I called and said, why?
[01:23:06.397 --> 01:23:08.559]  And they said, you're not the type of customer we want.
[01:23:09.019 --> 01:23:10.961]  They want young people to get into debt,
[01:23:12.202 --> 01:23:15.404]  And do this because it was created out of nothing.
[01:23:15.464 --> 01:23:22.931]  Understand, less than 15 private families own the private stock of the Federal Reserve and they control the issuance of credit.
[01:23:23.151 --> 01:23:26.494]  So they issue credit out of nothing and then get real assets out of it.
[01:23:26.534 --> 01:23:28.236]  So they want you to be in debt.
[01:23:28.656 --> 01:23:29.897]  The system has been set up.
[01:23:29.937 --> 01:23:34.481]  The economic system is a fraud from what it was previous to 1913.
[01:23:34.561 --> 01:23:41.486]  So, literally, nothing is a bigger scam than what you're told by the mainstream media on how our economic system works.
[01:23:41.586 --> 01:23:43.288]  It is a total scam.
[01:23:44.028 --> 01:23:54.777]  And they want to go ahead and kick off World War III, just like the globalists that clearly involved the 9-11, orchestrated 9-11, right as the stock market was correcting in late 2001.
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:00.544]  They've openly said they wanted to invade Iran for over two decades.
[01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:20.904]  I guess now it would be 28 years since the Ayatollahs came to power in 1979 and they want to widen it and escalate it and have a draft and again put more and more of our economy through the military-industrial complex system and because that's a controlled economy
[01:24:21.644 --> 01:24:28.294]  And if you look at who owns the big defense contractors, it's again predominantly Federal Reserve stockholding families.
[01:24:28.354 --> 01:24:29.856]  And these are the classic names you know.
[01:24:30.297 --> 01:24:30.918]  Rockefeller.
[01:24:31.838 --> 01:24:32.979]  We're talking about Rothschild.
[01:24:32.999 --> 01:24:36.542]  We're talking about the Queen of England, who owns British Petroleum predominantly.
[01:24:36.582 --> 01:24:37.923]  She owns a majority stock.
[01:24:38.243 --> 01:24:39.864]  Or the Queen of the Netherlands, Queen Beatrix.
[01:24:39.904 --> 01:24:41.265]  They go to globalist meetings.
[01:24:41.766 --> 01:24:43.447]  We've gotten their minutes out of the meetings.
[01:24:44.287 --> 01:24:46.049]  I've gone and covered it at Bilderberg Group.
[01:24:46.449 --> 01:24:50.872]  And they literally set the world's policies because they control the issuance of money.
[01:24:51.133 --> 01:24:53.715]  They're not out trying to, quote, make money in business.
[01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:55.076]  They literally make the money.
[01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:56.837]  They literally issue the money.
[01:24:57.939 --> 01:25:00.881]  And, we were led to war with lies of Yellow Cake.
[01:25:00.901 --> 01:25:07.225]  We were led to war with lies of WMDs, and Don Rumsfeld knew, and Dick Cheney knew, right where they were at.
[01:25:08.265 --> 01:25:10.227]  Then they said they were wrong, they screwed up.
[01:25:10.427 --> 01:25:10.687]  No!
[01:25:10.767 --> 01:25:12.388]  We have the White House Memo.
[01:25:12.428 --> 01:25:14.389]  Type White House Memo into your search engine.
[01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:18.692]  We have the actual minutes of that meeting, leaked by British Intelligence.
[01:25:18.712 --> 01:25:22.194]  The White House has said it's accurate, and wants to arrest whoever released it.
[01:25:22.654 --> 01:25:27.357]  And it's George Bush and Tony Blair, the Prime Minister of England, meeting
[01:25:28.175 --> 01:25:32.057]  A few months before the war, saying we've got to stage a WMD fine, we've got to get U.S.
[01:25:32.117 --> 01:25:36.780]  planes shot down, we've got to have defectors claim they saw WMDs.
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:37.680]  Lying!
[01:25:37.820 --> 01:25:39.481]  Premeditated lying!
[01:25:40.082 --> 01:25:49.367]  Even if you think being red, white, and blue means you go attack third world countries, and that's why you're a man, because you're into war, and you've got to support the government, even if it's butchering the Bill of Rights and the borders.
[01:25:49.827 --> 01:25:53.649]  You know, a lot of you really got your heads, well, 27% of you got your heads screwed on crooked.
[01:25:54.326 --> 01:26:02.448]  And you think 78% of us who are against the war, you think we're a bunch of ninnying weaklings because we're not for your bloodthirsty conquest.
[01:26:03.228 --> 01:26:05.969]  This is an unjust, undeclared fraud.
[01:26:06.209 --> 01:26:08.270]  They've lied to us in every respect.
[01:26:08.610 --> 01:26:13.271]  It's about to be four years in March, just a couple months away, that we've been in Iraq!
[01:26:14.591 --> 01:26:22.073]  And it's going to go on and on and on, and they always intended to stay there for all intents and purposes forever, just like any other country that's been invaded.
[01:26:22.887 --> 01:26:28.270]  And they keep lying to us and planting fake news in all of this garbage.
[01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:29.871]  And now, senior U.S.
[01:26:29.891 --> 01:26:38.055]  defense officials say they have evidence, but unnamed and they won't give the evidence, of some of the deadliest weapons being used against U.S.
[01:26:38.095 --> 01:26:42.017]  forces in Iraq to the highest levels of the Iranian government.
[01:26:42.097 --> 01:26:43.037]  Oh, now it's the highest levels.
[01:26:43.397 --> 01:26:48.260]  But Congressional Democrats are warning the administration to go slow in making its case.
[01:26:49.891 --> 01:26:54.914]  Don't worry, they're a bunch of hawks themselves, and they're owned by the very same lobby, so don't worry.
[01:26:55.154 --> 01:27:00.937]  You're going to get your World War III, and you're going to get to, I guess, have your rite of passage with our foreign troop army.
[01:27:01.177 --> 01:27:05.399]  I guess that our military is becoming foreign nationals from Mexico and the Philippines and...
[01:27:07.486 --> 01:27:08.227]  The Ukraine.
[01:27:08.247 --> 01:27:11.190]  I guess I'll have to go out at 4th of July parades and just salute them.
[01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:15.454]  And I guess if they come and take my guns like they did in New Orleans, I'll have to say, oh, thank you foreign troops!
[01:27:15.714 --> 01:27:16.976]  Oh my gosh, you're so patriotic!
[01:27:17.036 --> 01:27:17.916]  I'm a bad American!
[01:27:18.057 --> 01:27:19.298]  Holy foreigners are good!
[01:27:19.358 --> 01:27:19.999]  Oh, I love you!
[01:27:20.459 --> 01:27:24.563]  I mean, just think of how Orwellian, off the charts, crazy this is.
[01:27:24.603 --> 01:27:26.245]  They're announcing a North American Union.
[01:27:26.525 --> 01:27:28.447]  Our military is being converted to foreign troops.
[01:27:29.047 --> 01:27:31.390]  They're butchering the Bill of Rights.
[01:27:33.394 --> 01:27:37.475]  Here's Reuters, U.S.-led forces show evidence of Iranian arms in Iran.
[01:27:37.495 --> 01:27:38.716]  Then you read, there's no evidence.
[01:27:38.856 --> 01:27:46.959]  U.S.-led forces in Iraq presented on Sunday what officials said was a growing body of evidence of Iranian weapons being used to kill their soldiers.
[01:27:47.399 --> 01:27:54.061]  And there's no doubt that Iran is funding some of the insurgents in the fight against the other branch of Islam.
[01:27:54.081 --> 01:27:55.421]  They've always been killing each other.
[01:27:55.681 --> 01:27:58.762]  There's no doubt that Iran's not helping Hezbollah against Israel.
[01:27:59.203 --> 01:28:00.363]  Sure, there's no doubt of that.
[01:28:01.437 --> 01:28:15.221]  And Cy Hirsch reported two years ago, and it's now been admitted that thousands of Special Forces troops of the US have been in and out of Iraq, excuse me, Iran, carrying out operations, military operations.
[01:28:15.241 --> 01:28:16.942]  They have bombings and shootings.
[01:28:16.962 --> 01:28:19.603]  I mean, there's already a war going on over there right now.
[01:28:19.643 --> 01:28:21.023]  I mean, what do you expect, folks?
[01:28:21.203 --> 01:28:23.884]  They're just stirring up a hornet's nest on purpose.
[01:28:23.904 --> 01:28:26.045]  But you can't believe anything you're hearing from these people.
[01:28:27.159 --> 01:28:34.799]  Here's editor and publisher, New York Times, reporter who got Iraq WMDs wrong now highlights Iran claims.
[01:28:36.107 --> 01:28:45.411]  New York, Saturday's New York Times featured an article posted at the top of its website Friday that suggests very strongly that Iran is supplying the deadliest weapon.
[01:28:45.632 --> 01:28:49.553]  See, the New York Times being in the loop, they're not liberal or conservative folks.
[01:28:49.593 --> 01:28:53.335]  It's a government operation, just like Hearst Publishing and Yellow Journalism.
[01:28:53.375 --> 01:28:54.776]  Go look it up in your encyclopedia.
[01:28:55.016 --> 01:28:56.657]  You probably got them in the attic or in the garage.
[01:28:56.677 --> 01:28:57.277]  Go pull them out.
[01:28:57.477 --> 01:28:59.138]  Look up Yellow Journalism online.
[01:28:59.918 --> 01:29:02.599]  And New York Times is synonymous with it, right along with Hearst Publishing.
[01:29:02.919 --> 01:29:06.700]  That suggests very strongly, see they're saying it Friday and the military comes out Sunday.
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:10.140]  The deadliest weapon aimed at American troops in Iraq.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:10.921]  And what is it?
[01:29:10.981 --> 01:29:19.703]  It's IEDs and they claim that the explosives in there are linked back to the plastic explosive production in Iran.
[01:29:20.103 --> 01:29:24.944]  And so now, see, the aircraft carriers are all lined up ready to attack and here's the evidence!
[01:29:26.104 --> 01:29:30.725]  This is like all the other evidence we've been shown time and time again that turns out to be a fraud.
[01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:32.426]  I have no doubt this is manufactured evidence.
[01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:37.387]  But I also have no doubt that Iran isn't funding, quote, some of the insurgency.
[01:29:38.867 --> 01:29:40.508]  We'll be right back for the final segment.
[01:29:40.528 --> 01:29:42.788]  Take some final calls and get into the future of the web.
[01:29:42.808 --> 01:29:44.169]  They're trying to shut that down too.
[01:29:44.269 --> 01:29:44.649]  Stay with us.
[01:29:52.890 --> 01:29:54.591]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:29:54.771 --> 01:29:56.112]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:29:56.252 --> 01:29:59.093]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.

[01:30:54.419 --> 01:30:56.341]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[01:30:56.561 --> 01:31:00.504]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[01:31:01.045 --> 01:31:02.726]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:31:02.987 --> 01:31:03.507]  I have to

[01:31:55.723 --> 01:31:57.925]  Does everything turn into an argument with your kid?

[01:32:52.466 --> 01:32:57.109]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:57.930]  have diabetes.
[01:32:58.210 --> 01:33:05.155]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[01:33:05.315 --> 01:33:09.839]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[01:33:10.039 --> 01:33:12.861]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[01:34:02.272 --> 01:34:04.753]  Crushing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:34:07.434 --> 01:34:08.595]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:34:10.157 --> 01:34:12.018]  Alright folks, final segment.
[01:34:12.098 --> 01:34:14.399]  I'm here Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:34:14.639 --> 01:34:18.341]  syndicated out of the studios of NewsRadio 590 KLBJ.
[01:34:18.381 --> 01:34:25.545]  To the great folks running the show, Trey and Paul, to all the listeners, to the sponsors, to the affiliates out there, I salute you.
[01:34:26.165 --> 01:34:26.805]  I thank you.
[01:34:26.845 --> 01:34:31.768]  And to all the kooks that are still buying the government line, we are the majority on every issue.
[01:34:31.788 --> 01:34:34.409]  84% believe we're being lied to about 9-11.
[01:34:34.789 --> 01:34:38.671]  91% in Gallup polls when our border is controlled.
[01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:41.454]  78% want our troops out of Iraq.
[01:34:42.357 --> 01:34:46.567]  On every issue, Congress has a 14% approval rating, Cheney has a 12%.
[01:34:48.096 --> 01:34:49.577]  Hillary has about an 18 percent.
[01:34:49.637 --> 01:34:51.858]  We know who the enemies of America are.
[01:34:52.218 --> 01:35:03.222]  And the same ones that want to get us into World War III for the profit and the power, just like Hitler wanted to attack countries, are the same people getting rid of our sovereignty, and the same ones destroying our currency, and they will be defeated.
[01:35:03.502 --> 01:35:04.603]  Let's blast through.
[01:35:04.623 --> 01:35:06.223]  I've only got time to take five calls.
[01:35:06.243 --> 01:35:09.164]  We'll talk to Rome, Scott, John, Mark, and Rodney.
[01:35:10.005 --> 01:35:12.946]  Then we'll go to Rodney here next after I've talked to Scott and
[01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.552]  John and Mark, they've been holding the longest real fast.
[01:35:16.672 --> 01:35:19.073]  Let's go ahead and talk to John.
[01:35:19.393 --> 01:35:21.134]  Welcome sir, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:35:22.075 --> 01:35:23.596]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:35:23.616 --> 01:35:25.717]  I'm calling from Philadelphia, PA and I enjoy your show.
[01:35:26.358 --> 01:35:27.098]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:35:28.239 --> 01:35:29.460]  I just wanted to speak to you briefly.
[01:35:32.079 --> 01:35:32.259]  I don't
[01:35:48.331 --> 01:35:49.351]  Well, let me explain, sir.
[01:35:49.412 --> 01:35:51.432]  That's the Patriot Act, H.R.
[01:35:52.033 --> 01:35:54.274]  3162, passed October 27, 2001.
[01:35:55.394 --> 01:35:58.976]  They have used it in tens of thousands of non-terror-related cases.
[01:35:59.956 --> 01:36:03.538]  They couldn't get to know your customer to make you do all these background checks to get a bank account.
[01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.639]  They couldn't make you do all this to get jobs.
[01:36:05.919 --> 01:36:07.760]  They changed the federal law
[01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:11.162]  Only if you're an illegal alien do you not have to show ID and do all this.
[01:36:11.542 --> 01:36:13.404]  They, the corporations, have made a decision.
[01:36:13.684 --> 01:36:15.305]  The Justice Department doesn't prosecute.
[01:36:15.625 --> 01:36:17.427]  They're first class citizens.
[01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:19.048]  We're second and third class citizens.
[01:36:19.228 --> 01:36:27.414]  Did you see the AP a few months ago where they reported that 800 major lending institutions don't make illegal aliens show ID to get bank accounts or housing loans?
[01:36:28.034 --> 01:36:30.736]  Yes, and as a matter of fact, I worked for Bank of America.
[01:36:31.477 --> 01:36:32.697]  Oh, tell us all about it.
[01:36:32.718 --> 01:36:33.258]  Go ahead.
[01:36:33.298 --> 01:36:33.938]  You've got the floor.
[01:36:33.958 --> 01:36:34.219]  Tell us.
[01:36:34.779 --> 01:36:36.060]  Yeah, well, Bank of America
[01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:41.793]  They had a program where illegal aliens could send back money to Mexico.
[01:36:42.634 --> 01:36:51.639]  I forgot what the program was called, but it was encouraged, and as a matter of fact, managers were advised to go into Hispanic communities to promote this program.
[01:36:51.719 --> 01:36:54.261]  Yeah, you've got to show three forms of ID, but they don't.
[01:36:54.301 --> 01:37:00.484]  Again, nothing to do with security, the border's wide open, 2,000 less Border Patrol today than there were in 2001.
[01:37:00.545 --> 01:37:00.785]  Exactly.
[01:37:05.302 --> 01:37:08.763]  So, I mean, explain to people what you have to go through now, but again, this is the Patriot Act.
[01:37:09.503 --> 01:37:10.684]  Sure, I'll be more than happy to.
[01:37:11.904 --> 01:37:14.625]  I applied to an insurance company for a mid-level position.
[01:37:15.385 --> 01:37:22.747]  It's not a high-level position, and I was sent through an employment background screening company.
[01:37:22.807 --> 01:37:33.250]  I don't know if I can give you the name of it, but I received a packet back that is about an inch thick, and they ran criminal background, driver's license background, credit background,
[01:37:33.846 --> 01:37:38.429]  And again, I'm not near nuclear weapons or carrying a gun.
[01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:39.490]  No, I understand.
[01:37:40.311 --> 01:37:43.353]  Listen, I appreciate you're on board with us and I'm sorry you're going through all this.
[01:37:44.434 --> 01:37:46.756]  It's just off the charts what's happening.
[01:37:46.796 --> 01:37:48.577]  It's the surveillance society, sir.
[01:37:49.057 --> 01:37:51.359]  Again, no Fourth Amendment, no due process.
[01:37:51.659 --> 01:37:54.021]  The government's doing it, the corporations are doing it.
[01:37:55.002 --> 01:38:01.026]  Under the new National ID Card that becomes law next year, the REAL ID Act, already passed in 2005, becomes law three years later.
[01:38:01.984 --> 01:38:07.828]  If you have bad credit, you get a yellow rating on your national ID, and then they claim you have no due process, no Bill of Rights.
[01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:09.209]  It's total criminality.
[01:38:09.529 --> 01:38:11.411]  Rodney in Texas, welcome sir.
[01:38:11.431 --> 01:38:16.694]  Hey, Alex, God has blessed you with another beautiful birthday.
[01:38:16.754 --> 01:38:18.776]  I am blessed, thank you.
[01:38:19.736 --> 01:38:30.804]  Let me tell you, I did a little research while you were talking about this Iranian connection that the White House is putting out, and I went to the Washington Times, today's edition,
[01:38:31.684 --> 01:38:36.397]  And isn't there Steven Hadley, the guy that was appointed over the NSA?
[01:38:36.657 --> 01:38:39.385]  He's saying that it's overstated.
[01:38:39.485 --> 01:38:40.608]  It's all fabricated.
[01:38:41.852 --> 01:38:44.573]  It's the same people that gave you aluminum tubes.
[01:38:44.693 --> 01:38:50.954]  Listen, 1.6 billion from 2004 to 2005 alone paying for fake news.
[01:38:51.254 --> 01:38:57.216]  They admit CENTCOM has thousands of military people blogging domestically, posing as regular citizens.
[01:38:57.456 --> 01:38:58.876]  I mean, this is propaganda world!
[01:38:59.556 --> 01:39:02.337]  I mean, no one should be... This is not the Soviet Union!
[01:39:03.328 --> 01:39:14.214]  Well, I just wanted to call in and put that out there so people can go and check that everything that you're saying is true because when I read that I said, I don't even see how the Bush administration can sit.
[01:39:14.254 --> 01:39:26.461]  They don't say, they don't give the proof that it's Iranian plastic explosives being used in the IEDs, they don't say where they got it, and the people putting this out are the same reporters who were on the government operations before.
[01:39:27.181 --> 01:39:29.863]  Now, another story that caught my attention
[01:39:30.541 --> 01:39:48.327]  In USA Today's Friday's edition, they were talking about this new surge in the Ku Klux Klan rallies as a result of the illegals coming... And they're trying to say if you're... Yeah, so 91% of Americans, including almost 70% of Hispanics, now are Klan members, if you're against getting rid of our borders.
[01:39:48.951 --> 01:39:50.352]  Yeah, and it's so ridiculous.
[01:39:50.372 --> 01:39:52.053]  It's not going to work, Rodney.
[01:39:52.093 --> 01:39:56.297]  They never say anything about LaRosa and LaMatcha and all of these others.
[01:39:56.397 --> 01:39:59.859]  And did you see what was right next to it on the cover of USA Today Friday?
[01:39:59.879 --> 01:40:02.261]  Have you got past all the Anna Nicole train wreck?
[01:40:02.662 --> 01:40:02.802]  No.
[01:40:02.822 --> 01:40:03.542]  What did it say?
[01:40:04.143 --> 01:40:09.587]  Autism went from 1 in 20,000 24 years ago to 1 in 168 and now it's below 1 in 150 from the mercury and the vaccines.
[01:40:15.531 --> 01:40:20.614]  Oh, yes, I did see that story, but I really... Actually, you had it here in the stack because you don't have time to get to it.
[01:40:20.634 --> 01:40:21.935]  That's why I talk so fast.
[01:40:21.955 --> 01:40:23.096]  How am I supposed to cover all this?
[01:40:23.756 --> 01:40:29.119]  Well, anyway, I just want to say God bless you on your 33rd birthday, and I hope that you have many more.
[01:40:29.399 --> 01:40:33.462]  Rodney, God bless you, and you live long and prosper, as Spock says, too.
[01:40:33.922 --> 01:40:34.722]  Good to hear from you.
[01:40:35.383 --> 01:40:37.544]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rome.
[01:40:38.487 --> 01:40:39.628]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, buddy.
[01:40:39.648 --> 01:40:40.750]  I was going to say, when we declare amnesty,
[01:40:53.630 --> 01:40:55.793]  Well, let me just stop you.
[01:40:55.813 --> 01:40:58.617]  You say you disagree, but now you're saying you agree with me.
[01:40:58.717 --> 01:41:01.721]  I'm against the open borders and the illegal immigration.
[01:41:09.751 --> 01:41:12.333]  And we have way too much legal immigration.
[01:41:12.353 --> 01:41:13.573]  We've really got 30 million.
[01:41:13.613 --> 01:41:14.574]  That's a bad number.
[01:41:14.794 --> 01:41:16.075]  That's like a 7-year-old number.
[01:41:16.115 --> 01:41:17.516]  It's not 12 to 14 million.
[01:41:17.556 --> 01:41:18.436]  Lou Dobbs will tell you.
[01:41:18.736 --> 01:41:20.537]  It's over 30 million illegal aliens.
[01:41:20.937 --> 01:41:24.479]  Under the, quote, guest worker program, it's not an amnesty.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.841]  Unlimited skilled and unskilled visas.
[01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:29.402]  Anyone who's here is legal for 6 years.
[01:41:29.462 --> 01:41:30.683]  If you can get here, you're legal.
[01:41:30.883 --> 01:41:33.385]  And you can bring up to 65 family members in.
[01:41:33.605 --> 01:41:34.885]  Now, that's in the legislation.
[01:41:35.446 --> 01:41:36.786]  So, we agree here, brother.
[01:41:36.847 --> 01:41:37.947]  It's the debt of this country.
[01:41:38.207 --> 01:41:39.288]  Now, what do you disagree with?
[01:41:39.813 --> 01:41:47.658]  Well, I was just going to say, if I have a lot of babies from different women, can I get a lot of food stamps?
[01:41:48.118 --> 01:41:50.119]  It's all selectively enforced, sir.
[01:41:50.780 --> 01:41:54.482]  And if you're South African or German, you basically can't get into this country.
[01:41:54.522 --> 01:42:00.365]  But if you are from Africa or Latin America or China, it's an open door.
[01:42:01.046 --> 01:42:02.066]  But what do you disagree with?
[01:42:02.106 --> 01:42:02.546]  I want to hear it.
[01:42:03.167 --> 01:42:08.270]  Well, I guess the only thing I disagree with is the fact that you're not on Larry King's show.
[01:42:09.145 --> 01:42:09.906]  I'm Alex and happy 33rd.
[01:42:09.966 --> 01:42:10.547]  It's been a long time.
[01:42:30.592 --> 01:42:42.474]  There are so many things that you've mentioned lately that I wanted to talk about, but on this autism thing, we were just talking on the radio and we've been talking about these kind of things for a really long time.
[01:42:43.385 --> 01:42:45.807]  About Rick Perry and his incredible arrogance.
[01:42:46.227 --> 01:42:53.553]  Live cancer virus that he claims there's a law you gotta take, then people looked, as I said, no law, it's a health department recommendation.
[01:42:54.054 --> 01:43:00.179]  And his spokesperson said that it was an executive order and there's nothing you can do about it now.
[01:43:00.659 --> 01:43:02.140]  Well, are they going to impeach this guy?
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.583]  And his former chief of staff is a Merck employee.
[01:43:05.923 --> 01:43:06.144]  Right.
[01:43:06.664 --> 01:43:10.127]  Well, anyway, on the other subject, a long time ago,
[01:43:11.032 --> 01:43:18.477]  I watched a video of a talk that was given by, remember that other guy, the black guy that ran for president that no one remembers, Alan Keyes?
[01:43:18.517 --> 01:43:18.738]  Yes.
[01:43:19.398 --> 01:43:25.102]  He made a lot of sense and he was talking about the impeachment and the debauchery of Bill Clinton.
[01:43:25.865 --> 01:43:33.167]  Oh yeah, he's a globalist agent.
[01:43:33.487 --> 01:43:37.169]  Bro, we're out of time.
[01:43:37.229 --> 01:43:40.049]  Call me back on the syndicated show during the week or back next Sunday.
[01:43:40.269 --> 01:43:41.870]  The last minute I got left, let me tell you this.
[01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:45.391]  There is no law you have to take any vaccines.
[01:43:45.531 --> 01:43:46.531]  Babies, anybody.
[01:43:46.992 --> 01:43:47.172]  Okay?
[01:43:47.192 --> 01:43:48.432]  There is no law.
[01:43:49.233 --> 01:43:57.835]  It is a recommendation to the state health departments and the schools tell you it's a law because they get thousands of dollars, thousands of their federal and state funding is attached to that.
[01:43:58.195 --> 01:43:59.435]  So it's a giant fraud.
[01:44:00.256 --> 01:44:03.817]  And they totally take poor people's kids because they can't defend themselves, don't know their rights.
[01:44:03.857 --> 01:44:06.697]  Well, I know a well-to-do, wealthy family here in town.
[01:44:06.717 --> 01:44:09.058]  They have well-to-do, wealthy friends.
[01:44:09.498 --> 01:44:13.119]  They went and had a baby at Seton, at one of their spin-off clinics.
[01:44:13.259 --> 01:44:13.859]  This is Friday.
[01:44:14.568 --> 01:44:16.830]  And they said, no, you're not giving the newborn baby any shots.
[01:44:17.070 --> 01:44:19.212]  They said, CPS will take your children then.
[01:44:19.552 --> 01:44:20.733]  And then we had to get on the phone.
[01:44:20.753 --> 01:44:22.474]  They had to explain the media was coming down there.
[01:44:22.494 --> 01:44:23.635]  And they said, oh, we were wrong.
[01:44:23.655 --> 01:44:25.016]  There's no law that won't take your kid.
[01:44:25.977 --> 01:44:27.538]  Folks, they take kids every day.
[01:44:28.639 --> 01:44:31.461]  It's got to be every week in Austin, but every few minutes in this country.
[01:44:31.541 --> 01:44:35.364]  I mean, I've been to the hospital when they're taking people's kids for non-existent laws.
[01:44:35.684 --> 01:44:36.585]  It's totally criminal.
[01:44:36.865 --> 01:44:38.086]  See you back here next week.
[01:44:38.326 --> 01:44:40.668]  InfoWars.com, Google Terror Storm.

[01:45:19.041 --> 01:45:22.222]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
