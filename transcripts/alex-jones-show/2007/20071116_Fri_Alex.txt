[00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.023]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:11.465]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:13.166]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.806 --> 00:00:17.730]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.113]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:28.618]  Lock S-foils in attack position, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.658 --> 00:00:30.580]  We're going in against the Death Star.
[00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.762]  We're going in against the New World Order.
[00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.595]  The enemy has declared war on the American people.
[00:00:39.635 --> 00:00:43.258]  They've made a public declaration repeatedly in the last month.
[00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:51.845]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a key point in the enemy's attack pattern in my analysis, and many others see it for exactly what it is.
[00:00:51.865 --> 00:01:05.656]  This is a big, fat red balloon going up in a big, fat way, and we're going to be tracking that and documenting all of this in the next three hours on this very important
[00:01:07.043 --> 00:01:11.828]  November 16th, 2007, Friday, Transmission Against Tyranny.
[00:01:11.848 --> 00:01:22.599]  A lot of people say, look at the size of that thing, and I say, ladies and gentlemen, cut the chatter and go into the trenches and engage the enemy, because we are going to bring them down.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.927]  And they know it, and they have analyzed our attack pattern, and they know there is a great danger to their New World Order.
[00:01:30.487 --> 00:01:49.572]  They realize it's all about ideas and initiative, and the minute you figure out we can bring these criminals to justice, the minute you figure out that we can arrest the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the minute you figure out the elite can be defeated, once they've been exposed as the terrorists they are, that the New World Order can be brought down.
[00:01:52.793 --> 00:01:54.854]  We've got a big show lined up for you today.
[00:01:54.894 --> 00:02:10.904]  Coming up in the second hour, Jesse Benton, Communications Director for Ron Paul's 2008 campaign, is going to be joining us to talk about how they've declared Ron Paul's supporters, all libertarians and anti-war activists, as Al-Qaeda, and they have said the U.S.
[00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:13.126]  military needs to be used against us.
[00:02:13.606 --> 00:02:21.751]  An enemy declaration of high treason against the republic for which it stands, ladies and gentlemen, this is Red Level.
[00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.420]  And I had him on last Friday.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.125]  I want to do a repeat of that again today because there wasn't enough time in the 45 minutes of transmission that we had with him in that hour.
[00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:38.291]  Steve Quayle will be joining us again to help us analyze these very serious indicators coming up as well.
[00:02:38.311 --> 00:02:42.734]  So Jesse Benton, Ron Paul 2008 campaign, Steve Quayle in the third hour.
[00:02:43.495 --> 00:02:50.440]  And we do have Ron Paul, our champion, joining us next Wednesday to let you know about that.
[00:02:53.021 --> 00:03:04.526]  Alright, let me just run down some of the news that we'll be covering and then I'll get into the enemy's main attack pattern that is a very, very serious announcement that they've made.
[00:03:05.627 --> 00:03:14.171]  Israel is slamming the IAEA for failing to expose Iran and Iran is saying they are owed an apology.
[00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:27.767]  Because of this, the IAEA says they have, quote, fully complied with world government control and UN occupation, and that they are not developing any systems for nuclear weapons.
[00:03:28.387 --> 00:03:44.637]  And the CIA, again, says it's eight and a half years until they were left alone, until they could build even a crude atomic device with no, even medium-range delivery system for it, but the neocons are saying war must start now,
[00:03:45.477 --> 00:03:52.322]  Uh, that, uh, just like they said Saddam had secret space weapons that could knock out all the power in the U.S.
[00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:52.922]  Remember that?
[00:03:52.982 --> 00:03:58.967]  Or he could fire nuclear missiles in 45 minutes and vaporize Airstrip One, Britannia.
[00:03:59.547 --> 00:04:03.670]  I mean, just unmitigated lies to a public who can't find the U.S.
[00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.973]  on the globe, doesn't know how many continents there are, doesn't know the difference between the Arctic and the Antarctic.
[00:04:08.853 --> 00:04:10.875]  Uh, doesn't even know what a pinguino is.
[00:04:11.395 --> 00:04:21.784]  They basically don't know their head from a stinking hole in the ground, and that's why they've been able to engage in the type of ridiculous sophistry and propaganda of a Python-esque level.
[00:04:24.946 --> 00:04:31.051]  But, um, again, Iran is saying, look, we fully submitted to you, and it's just nothing is good enough for you people.
[00:04:31.937 --> 00:04:36.600]  And they're just counting on the public, men, completely and totally abjectly ignorant.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:37.641]  So we'll go over some of that.
[00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:43.645]  Complaints flood CNN after Beck smears Ron Paul supporters as terrorists.
[00:04:45.126 --> 00:04:46.567]  We'll be getting into that first.
[00:04:46.747 --> 00:04:48.568]  This is really important, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:48.868 --> 00:04:58.755]  We're going to be breaking it down in the next segment, right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[00:05:01.681 --> 00:05:03.081]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.202]  A new world order.
[00:05:05.922 --> 00:05:10.144]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new world order.
[00:05:10.824 --> 00:05:12.605]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:05:13.625 --> 00:05:15.906]  So their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.426 --> 00:05:18.907]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.607 --> 00:05:26.949]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.952 --> 00:05:34.955]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.416 --> 00:05:38.898]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:41.780]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.001]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.021 --> 00:05:43.761]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:44.862]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.082 --> 00:05:45.502]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.522 --> 00:05:47.083]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:07:01.318 --> 00:07:08.789]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:15.460]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:15.980]  I'm good.
[00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:40.156]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.

[00:08:01.016 --> 00:08:06.040]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.421 --> 00:08:08.742]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:13.366 --> 00:08:23.895]  There are two key articles up on prisonplanet.com and a third, even more important, coming out via infowars.net in the next three hours.
[00:08:25.582 --> 00:08:32.545]  Neo-con attack on Ron Paul greasing the skids for the implementation of H.R.
[00:08:32.565 --> 00:08:32.545]  1955.
[00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:44.049]  The other headline, complaints flood CNN after Beck smears Ron Paul supporters as terrorists.
[00:08:47.006 --> 00:08:57.275]  Now, the articles by Kurt Nemo and the articles by Paul Watson are excellent, but again, they do not actually give you the full seriousness.
[00:08:57.355 --> 00:09:07.343]  Though they look shocking and scary and are all documented and are unbelievable, it is not one-tenth as bad as it actually is.
[00:09:09.224 --> 00:09:11.947]  It is very hard to even explain.
[00:09:12.467 --> 00:09:14.669]  I was here with a writer yesterday who was interviewing me.
[00:09:16.241 --> 00:09:18.722]  And, uh, for a publication, a major publication.
[00:09:19.703 --> 00:09:40.273]  And, uh, he'd done a lot of research and was aware of this, and we were out there for about an hour and a half just trying to even grasp, out at the coffee shop across the street outside, trying to even grasp and chronicle all of the checklist that the establishment's going down, gearing up for total, absolute, open dictatorship and maximum tyranny.
[00:09:42.013 --> 00:09:42.934]  It is so huge.
[00:09:46.014 --> 00:09:47.916]  It is so single-minded.
[00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:52.159]  It is clearly in train.
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.121]  That is, it is rolling down the track.
[00:09:55.201 --> 00:09:56.602]  It is happening.
[00:09:57.643 --> 00:09:59.885]  Now, they are blowing their cover.
[00:10:00.005 --> 00:10:04.368]  Everyone is waking up and hating them, but they're still moving forward.
[00:10:04.529 --> 00:10:07.511]  I mean, the Communist Chinese are hated in China, but they still are in control.
[00:10:08.445 --> 00:10:17.313]  And it's clear that the New World Order crowd is absolutely going for broke and is uncloaking themselves for the entire world to see.
[00:10:17.353 --> 00:10:26.560]  They've taken off their clown suit and now everyone can see them for the Nazgul Ringwraith Grim Reapers that they truly are.
[00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:36.629]  So let me just calmly try to give you an overview of what's going on and why this is such a big deal, what I've seen happen in the last four weeks.
[00:10:38.670 --> 00:11:01.122]  It is the public manifestation of something I discovered 12 years ago, something that I've been obsessed with for 12, 13 years on air, the police state, the training manuals that patriots and Christians and gun owners are terrorists, and the covert program to build FEMA camps and relocation centers, and now recruiting the police, the military,
[00:11:02.042 --> 00:11:08.947]  City leaders, county leaders, state leaders, 26,000 preachers to pacify the public.
[00:11:09.028 --> 00:11:28.642]  It is a covert black ops operation going on for at least four decades and growing very slowly, very methodically, dotting every I, crossing every T. A creeping death that now is no longer creeping, is now racing like wild mustangs
[00:11:29.502 --> 00:11:32.325]  Uh, on the North Dakota plains.
[00:11:36.209 --> 00:11:36.790]  It's happening.
[00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:45.959]  And then to have them publicly announce it, and publicly switch, uh, the
[00:11:47.173 --> 00:12:14.157]  Talking points to a continual beacon, a continual blurping, a continual bleating of the fact that any American that does not fully support the end of liberty and freedom, the Constitution, Bill of Rights, if you don't support open borders, if you don't support endless fraudulent wars, black holes of corruption and graft and money laundering, if you don't support trillions missing from the Pentagon, if you don't support
[00:12:14.557 --> 00:12:17.360]  Bid rigging and corruption and private mercenary armies.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:33.315]  If you don't support total vaccine liability protection for all the makers and forced inoculations and just wall-to-wall checkpoints and cameras in school bathrooms and microphones on street corners and taser deaths every day, then you are Al Qaeda!
[00:12:34.847 --> 00:12:44.034]  Now again, they've privately been training the police, the military, the FBI, setting up local CIA offices in the FEMA threat matrix integration centers.
[00:12:44.094 --> 00:12:46.116]  They call it threat matrix integration centers.
[00:12:46.576 --> 00:12:48.577]  Locally, you know them as emergency management centers.
[00:12:49.878 --> 00:12:54.342]  They have been integrating all of this, and we told you that when they started announcing on the news
[00:12:55.519 --> 00:13:19.114]  uh... that people that question the government and didn't like the government were terrorists that uh... that was a preparatory uh... generally two to three months uh... prep phase for massive stage terror attacks to drive you back into the black arms the black wings of your new world order controllers so they have now fully swung their main guns around
[00:13:20.425 --> 00:13:25.809]  They got your tribal fervor going of the outsider, the people that look different, the people in caves.
[00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.472]  Average Americans, again, didn't even know where Afghanistan was.
[00:13:29.872 --> 00:13:32.114]  They think it's in the Middle East, not Central Asia.
[00:13:32.494 --> 00:13:37.118]  It's some foggy cave dweller that is creeping around under tables and hiding in bushes.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:47.647]  But now they're swinging around with this huge apparatus that they've built here so lovingly and crafted and prepared.
[00:13:49.364 --> 00:14:00.113]  They are now swinging this huge juggernaut of anti-American tyranny towards the American people, and the government is now declaring us the enemy openly.
[00:14:00.553 --> 00:14:18.147]  They are now saying, well, the majority of Americans hate us and don't trust us, and there's evil terrorists capitalizing on that, and they're against the war, and they're libertarians, and they're liberals, and they're conservatives, and they're the American people, and only 11% of the people like us, and they're terrorists!
[00:14:18.487 --> 00:14:18.967]  The people?
[00:14:19.507 --> 00:14:21.288]  I mean, oh, so 89% of us are terrorists.
[00:14:21.308 --> 00:14:22.188]  I mean, that's what they said!
[00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:40.915]  O'Reilly, Hanovey, Beck, but it's other programs, and it's a massive talking point, and last night I was riveting off all of these different facets and points to Paul Watson, and he started adding a bunch I'd forgotten about.
[00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:41.855]  See, that's the problem.
[00:14:41.895 --> 00:14:44.236]  You can't... This is a huge 30-40 year program.
[00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:50.126]  With everything they learned from past dictatorships, how do you describe something this big?
[00:14:50.226 --> 00:14:52.406]  You could teach 30 master's courses.
[00:14:53.086 --> 00:14:55.427]  You could teach PhD courses on this.
[00:14:55.487 --> 00:14:56.607]  And they actually do, by the way.
[00:14:56.907 --> 00:14:58.468]  Just how to run the ops and how to do it.
[00:15:00.008 --> 00:15:01.408]  And Paul said, well, of course.
[00:15:01.608 --> 00:15:03.789]  I said, this is clearly a Republican talking point.
[00:15:03.809 --> 00:15:05.129]  This is clearly out of the White House.
[00:15:05.549 --> 00:15:06.969]  This is clearly... He goes, well, of course it is.
[00:15:06.989 --> 00:15:14.891]  Don't you remember the memo from the State Department public declaration last year that 9-11 conspiracy terrorists and anti-war people should be lumped in and called terrorists?
[00:15:15.546 --> 00:15:16.426]  No, we're good to go.
[00:15:36.754 --> 00:15:39.756]  There's spooks everywhere, folks.
[00:15:39.817 --> 00:15:40.857]  Camps everywhere.
[00:15:41.157 --> 00:15:42.518]  Foreign troops everywhere.
[00:15:42.619 --> 00:15:46.221]  Aggravated felons just swelling the ranks of the military.
[00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:46.982]  Foreigners.
[00:15:47.582 --> 00:15:48.162]  Swelling.
[00:15:48.202 --> 00:15:51.905]  I mean, you couldn't make it up in a science fiction horror movie.
[00:15:52.846 --> 00:15:59.931]  It is the worst, most abominable amalgamation of every tyranny ever invented by man put into one.
[00:16:02.473 --> 00:16:04.074]  And then you look at the crew running this,
[00:16:04.907 --> 00:16:10.712]  They're either got Neo-Nazi connections, or weirdo Zionist connections, or hardcore Trotskyite connections.
[00:16:11.893 --> 00:16:17.858]  Their grandfathers and mothers and grandmothers and brothers were all commissariat mass murderer killers.
[00:16:17.878 --> 00:16:19.119]  I mean, go right down the line.
[00:16:19.179 --> 00:16:25.485]  I mean, literally hiring Marcus Wolf, the head of the Stasi, to come over here and help set this up four years ago.
[00:16:26.005 --> 00:16:28.427]  I mean, you couldn't make that up!
[00:16:29.648 --> 00:16:31.510]  Who could think this stuff up?
[00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:32.922]  You couldn't!
[00:16:32.982 --> 00:16:36.785]  No one would believe it if you wrote a Tom Clancy book where all this was happening.
[00:16:36.845 --> 00:16:40.987]  They are throwing everything at us, including the kitchen sink.
[00:16:41.087 --> 00:16:43.768]  I mean, they are inventing new things.
[00:16:43.828 --> 00:16:48.571]  They have got thousands of programs going at the same time, not even knowing if they'll work.
[00:16:48.891 --> 00:16:54.875]  Just in unison, they are rushing for the finish line, literally dumping a tsunami on us.
[00:16:56.275 --> 00:16:59.177]  And now the propaganda has heated up in a big way.
[00:17:02.338 --> 00:17:16.837]  And now they have geared up massively against the American people and they are making statements, I'm hearing Bortz, I'm hearing Savage, I am seeing them on TV, and folks, it's everywhere now.
[00:17:17.618 --> 00:17:25.340]  That the American people are terrorists, and that the American people need to have the military used on them.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:38.483]  Now remember three years ago, when Tommy French retired, I knew he was on the payroll, and they've admitted they're paying billions in secret funding for people to propagandize, and later it came out he's being paid almost 500 grand a year to go give speeches saying,
[00:17:39.608 --> 00:17:42.532]  Gee, Willikers, I don't like it, but it's what the people want.
[00:17:42.573 --> 00:17:43.694]  It will keep us safe.
[00:17:44.635 --> 00:17:46.759]  Martial law is coming after the next attack.
[00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:47.760]  It's what you need.
[00:17:49.222 --> 00:17:52.246]  And then they pass it in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act.
[00:17:52.727 --> 00:17:55.972]  Shame for insurrection and rebellion by the American people.
[00:17:57.339 --> 00:18:05.921]  And then they... Bush signs the Continuity of Government PDD 51 in May 9th of this year, saying he is a dictator and Congress has no authority.
[00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:18.643]  And then a couple months later, a few months ago, in Ottawa, in Montebello, he publicly signed Continuity of Government during massive terror attacks or bioweapons releases under UN control.
[00:18:19.444 --> 00:18:20.344]  Publicly released.
[00:18:20.364 --> 00:18:21.464]  Jerome Corsi came on.
[00:18:21.884 --> 00:18:22.484]  We covered it.
[00:18:22.604 --> 00:18:23.444]  This is real!
[00:18:24.765 --> 00:18:25.705]  This is happening!
[00:18:26.448 --> 00:18:27.549]  They're doing it!
[00:18:28.009 --> 00:18:31.191]  The Houston Chronicle has reported the FEMA camps.
[00:18:31.311 --> 00:18:32.432]  I know it's unbelievable.
[00:18:32.652 --> 00:18:33.773]  It's happening.
[00:18:34.193 --> 00:18:39.157]  They're testing the water to see if you bite, to see if you buy into it.
[00:18:39.997 --> 00:18:45.681]  You know, even if you believe the official 9-11 story, that Al-Qaeda attacked us, they came from Saudi Arabia.
[00:18:47.542 --> 00:18:48.843]  Well, why'd we go into Afghanistan?
[00:18:48.863 --> 00:18:49.924]  Why'd we go into Iraq?
[00:18:50.084 --> 00:18:51.665]  Well, why are they talking about Iran now?
[00:18:52.206 --> 00:18:54.267]  Well, they're not just going to say the Iranians did it now.
[00:18:54.287 --> 00:18:55.748]  They're going to say the American people are.
[00:18:56.542 --> 00:18:57.883]  And they are saying that.
[00:18:58.843 --> 00:19:00.524]  So this is a big deal.
[00:19:02.005 --> 00:19:11.090]  They built this whole police state, they built this whole anti-terrorist system, left the borders open, everybody knew it was a fraud, and now they're saying, oh yeah, guess who the terrorists are?
[00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:12.170]  You!
[00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.792]  89% of the American people.
[00:19:16.593 --> 00:19:17.533]  You're against the war.
[00:19:18.794 --> 00:19:20.375]  You think 9-11's an inside job.
[00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:23.878]  You're against corruption that's going on.
[00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:25.659]  You're criticizing the government.
[00:19:26.159 --> 00:19:32.104]  You are aiding the terrorists, and the military's job is to take you on.
[00:19:33.385 --> 00:19:34.425]  That's what Glenn Beck said.
[00:19:36.327 --> 00:19:38.368]  I mean, they're out in the open now.
[00:19:38.849 --> 00:19:40.650]  They've gone down the whole checklist.
[00:19:42.231 --> 00:19:46.154]  They have set the whole thing up, and these guys are making their move.
[00:19:46.841 --> 00:19:54.367]  I mean, you're seeing actual Joseph Goebbels, actual Heinrich Himmlers, actual Lenins and Stalins and Maos in the making.
[00:19:54.847 --> 00:19:55.468]  They want it.
[00:19:55.568 --> 00:19:57.449]  They're going for it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:58.110 --> 00:20:01.252]  These are absolute, total criminals.
[00:20:01.592 --> 00:20:02.553]  Ted Anders for Midas.
[00:20:02.613 --> 00:20:02.933]  November 16, 2007.
[00:20:02.993 --> 00:20:03.194]  Gold 793.90.
[00:20:03.254 --> 00:20:05.295]  Hansco coins can be purchased for $817.94, $403.15 for half, $201.58 for quarter.
[00:20:05.315 --> 00:20:05.615]  That's $817.94, $403.15, and $201.58.
[00:20:16.218 --> 00:20:18.919]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[00:20:18.959 --> 00:20:20.739]  The bond market continues to slump.
[00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:21.239]  J.P.
[00:20:21.279 --> 00:20:24.240]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.481]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[00:20:26.561 --> 00:20:31.462]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[00:20:31.502 --> 00:20:33.943]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[00:20:34.063 --> 00:20:38.464]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[00:20:38.824 --> 00:20:39.224]  The U.S.
[00:20:39.264 --> 00:20:43.625]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[00:20:43.725 --> 00:20:45.486]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[00:20:45.946 --> 00:20:48.708]  Economist Rody Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[00:20:48.988 --> 00:20:50.128]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.

[00:21:01.854 --> 00:21:04.315]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:04.855 --> 00:21:10.818]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[00:21:11.018 --> 00:21:17.400]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:29.905]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.

[00:23:03.078 --> 00:23:08.482]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:23:08.922 --> 00:23:13.665]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:23:14.065 --> 00:23:16.687]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:23:17.187 --> 00:23:20.590]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:25.673]  The truth is, is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:23:26.133 --> 00:23:29.316]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:23:29.916 --> 00:23:32.758]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.671]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:23:35.711 --> 00:23:37.811]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:23:37.831 --> 00:23:38.171]  U.S.
[00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:39.892]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:23:39.912 --> 00:23:40.212]  Call 888-8XANADU.
[00:23:40.232 --> 00:23:41.092]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:23:41.112 --> 00:23:41.792]  Ask for George.
[00:24:02.275 --> 00:24:16.042]  Alright, here are the basic facts.
[00:24:16.062 --> 00:24:20.044]  99% of the time in history, you get dictatorships, you get corrupt elites ruling over you.
[00:24:20.064 --> 00:24:24.947]  They generally use crises or the threat of the outside enemy where they're really promulgated to do it.
[00:24:26.096 --> 00:24:35.303]  And the sons of Nazi agents and Zionist agents and the Communist 4th International that Stalin kicked out of Russia all came here.
[00:24:35.744 --> 00:24:36.785]  This is them saying it.
[00:24:37.225 --> 00:24:38.466]  Again, I'm not making this up.
[00:24:38.926 --> 00:24:39.787]  This sounds crazy.
[00:24:39.847 --> 00:24:40.247]  It's true.
[00:24:40.267 --> 00:24:46.312]  I mean, you can hear Glenn Beck talk about it like it's some badge of honor with the Horowitz and the rest of them.
[00:24:47.073 --> 00:24:48.754]  And they came over here and they took over.
[00:24:48.854 --> 00:24:51.556]  They are hardcore, okay?
[00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:53.257]  I mean, you saw 9-11.
[00:24:54.158 --> 00:24:55.259]  These people don't play games.
[00:24:56.318 --> 00:25:00.723]  And they got their little minions out there that are useful idiots or whatever, and they're compartmentalized.
[00:25:02.185 --> 00:25:04.868]  And every one of them to a man is a former Trotskyite or beatnik.
[00:25:05.109 --> 00:25:06.050]  Savage, all of them.
[00:25:08.072 --> 00:25:09.594]  I just wish you would be educated folks.
[00:25:09.614 --> 00:25:11.096]  You'd know how serious these people are.
[00:25:11.836 --> 00:25:12.197]  Okay?
[00:25:13.118 --> 00:25:14.780]  And they're in place now.
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:32.676]  And they have told you Al Qaeda is going to kill you, give your rights up, launch all these wars, let the private corporations loot the treasury, let all types of corruption, you know, let Halliburton trucks that are worth $20,000 old junkers be sold for $15 million, bought by the U.S.
[00:25:32.716 --> 00:25:33.117]  government.
[00:25:33.217 --> 00:25:36.520]  I mean, just blue tarps that cost $5 million.
[00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:45.233]  Uh, tens of billions of dollars per month and hundred dollar bills on pallets funding warlords to actually kill our troops and keep the war going.
[00:25:45.533 --> 00:25:46.553]  I told you about this years ago.
[00:25:46.593 --> 00:25:48.234]  Now it's even come out in the mainstream news.
[00:25:48.794 --> 00:25:50.214]  It's so diabolical.
[00:25:50.274 --> 00:25:51.475]  It's order out of chaos.
[00:25:52.095 --> 00:25:54.695]  They go in and just create a war zone like Vietnam.
[00:25:55.036 --> 00:25:57.456]  Don't let anybody win it and just dump money into it.
[00:25:59.097 --> 00:25:59.877]  And that's what they want.
[00:25:59.917 --> 00:26:02.798]  They want chaos so they can rob and loot and do whatever they want.
[00:26:02.838 --> 00:26:04.698]  So they've got their little operatives up there.
[00:26:04.738 --> 00:26:07.439]  These little sharp-eyed, uh, sharp-tongued demons.
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:18.127]  And to have Glenn Beck and Bortz and all of them, I've been hearing it for four weeks, say, you just wait till the terrorists hit.
[00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:24.151]  And all of you that have been against us going into Iran, you're all going to get locked up because you're aiding the terrorists.
[00:26:24.191 --> 00:26:25.232]  And then they cackle.
[00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:32.618]  And it's all in, I mean, how obvious does it get when Republican memos say they need terror attacks?
[00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:35.821]  And then they come out and they pass 404
[00:26:38.650 --> 00:27:05.531]  Of the 435 members of the House, it's now in the Senate, the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act, and it says, we're going to decide what lies about the government, and they said 9-11 truth, they've now said that, we said they would say that, sure enough, because we knew it was a Republican memo from before, last year, and then of course the State Department statement, it's a talking point, it's an admitted, that's the headline for you, is White House puts out talking point that those that criticize war are terrorists.
[00:27:07.202 --> 00:27:07.562]  That's it!
[00:27:07.882 --> 00:27:17.685]  I mean, they have, the government has done what this whole anti-terror grid was about, is they've now swiveled it around to the real target that it was all along.
[00:27:17.705 --> 00:27:20.585]  You know, they tell us the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:27:23.166 --> 00:27:25.347]  The terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:27:25.947 --> 00:27:32.748]  And then the government does everything it can to take all of our basic freedoms while, if you believe there's a real outside terror threat, doing everything they can to leave that wide open.
[00:27:34.009 --> 00:27:34.889]  See, it didn't hold water.
[00:27:35.814 --> 00:27:39.097]  And so now they're just saying, hey, we'll just go to a national security dictatorship.
[00:27:40.058 --> 00:27:41.659]  We'll just have executive rule.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.201]  To keep you safe, of course.
[00:27:43.681 --> 00:27:47.144]  And then anyone that disagrees with us is aiding terrorists, so you're not allowed to speak.
[00:27:47.565 --> 00:27:50.167]  And then you have a congressional body, they're on the verge of passing.
[00:27:50.467 --> 00:27:55.232]  Meanwhile, Homeland Security Committees are having simultaneous meetings.
[00:27:58.639 --> 00:28:07.363]  Simultaneous meetings of the Homeland Security Intelligence Information Sharing Errors of Risk Assessment on the same talking points the State Department put out through the White House.
[00:28:07.643 --> 00:28:10.024]  The White House put it out through them last year.
[00:28:10.284 --> 00:28:10.984]  We have a link to that.
[00:28:11.044 --> 00:28:11.504]  It's public.
[00:28:11.904 --> 00:28:15.366]  And it says 9-11 Truth Groups and they mix us in with Al Qaeda.
[00:28:15.866 --> 00:28:19.167]  And what do they show in the PowerPoint presentation last week in Congress?
[00:28:19.548 --> 00:28:26.270]  They show architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, the scientists and experts and engineers that are scaring the establishment.
[00:28:26.711 --> 00:28:35.554]  They show their website and name and other 9-11 site names in between video clips of Al-Qaeda training and say they all work together.
[00:28:36.675 --> 00:28:39.936]  Now again, to a halfway intellectual person, that's ridiculous.
[00:28:40.757 --> 00:28:46.500]  But to a public who literally, folks, doesn't know what their state capital is, literally, they know nothing.
[00:28:48.161 --> 00:28:50.922]  They watch the Sopranos and football and that's it.
[00:28:51.322 --> 00:28:54.284]  They hear that, folks, about 11% are going to believe it.
[00:28:54.824 --> 00:28:56.325]  That's their 11% that will buy anything.
[00:28:57.566 --> 00:28:59.706]  Pollsters say about 20% they call brain dead.
[00:29:01.567 --> 00:29:02.907]  But you can argue what number it is.
[00:29:02.967 --> 00:29:13.049]  And they'll man the FEMA camps, they'll put on the black uniforms, and so it's going to be a minority, but that has the quote, authority of the government just running around having their way with us.
[00:29:13.649 --> 00:29:14.709]  I say it's not going to work.
[00:29:15.829 --> 00:29:23.991]  Hitler had about half the public when he first got in, then he brainwashed and got about 90% approval ratings, and then by the end he was very unpopular, but he'd kill anybody that spoke up.
[00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:28.280]  I don't think, looking at history and studying this, they're going to get away with it.
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.400]  But they'll be able, though, to bring it in at least.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:32.740]  And then the U.S.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:34.181]  is just going to completely collapse.
[00:29:35.801 --> 00:29:39.001]  Like Mike Rivera says, just like the Soviet Union.
[00:29:41.122 --> 00:29:41.562]  I know this.
[00:29:41.622 --> 00:29:42.722]  We're in for hell on earth.
[00:29:42.922 --> 00:29:46.963]  We are in for just toe-to-toe combat with actual commissars.
[00:29:50.863 --> 00:29:51.824]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.844 --> 00:29:53.744]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.763 --> 00:29:57.453]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.002 --> 00:30:02.843]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:02.983 --> 00:30:08.165]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:30:08.345 --> 00:30:09.686]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:30:09.946 --> 00:30:18.130]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:24.132]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:24.252 --> 00:30:26.013]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:26.093 --> 00:30:28.194]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:28.394 --> 00:30:28.815]  I think so.
[00:30:43.697 --> 00:30:43.977]  We're good.
[00:31:00.865 --> 00:31:04.186]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[00:31:04.506 --> 00:31:09.507]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[00:31:09.907 --> 00:31:15.048]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:31:15.288 --> 00:31:15.868]  Here's why.
[00:31:16.068 --> 00:31:24.070]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:24.970]  We're good to go.
[00:31:42.819 --> 00:31:44.380]  You must pay a small shipping charge.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.440]  To get your DVD, simply call 888-213-1455.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:46.700]  That's 888-213-1455.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.741]  If the line is busy, please keep trying to call back.
[00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:49.961]  That number again is 888-213-1455.
[00:32:00.525 --> 00:32:01.426]  Storable Food!
[00:32:01.646 --> 00:32:02.446]  Storable Food!
[00:32:30.265 --> 00:32:30.565]  I think so.
[00:33:01.529 --> 00:33:06.631]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:07.351 --> 00:33:09.632]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:10.912 --> 00:33:12.813]  Alright!
[00:33:28.556 --> 00:33:32.480]  In the second hour, the Ron Paul Campaign Communication Director joins us.
[00:33:33.101 --> 00:33:38.026]  CNN has said that Ron Paul supporters are working for Al Qaeda, that the U.S.
[00:33:38.066 --> 00:33:41.850]  military should be used against us, that we are treasonous traitors.
[00:33:42.891 --> 00:33:47.576]  They have lumped in anti-war activists, liberals, libertarians, Lou Rockwell,
[00:33:48.517 --> 00:33:55.220]  This is a talking point, and we actually dug out the State Department White House Memorandum from last year, declassified.
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:59.442]  We have a declassified version saying they were going to call opposition terrorists.
[00:33:59.943 --> 00:34:02.044]  They are not the unthinkable that's happening.
[00:34:02.084 --> 00:34:04.345]  We've seen all their preparation over the years for this.
[00:34:05.453 --> 00:34:14.377]  The internal police flyers, remember in Phoenix, under Clinton, saying gun owners, constitutionalists, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:34:14.397 --> 00:34:16.657]  Constitution, are terrorists.
[00:34:16.978 --> 00:34:21.519]  We have FEMA in Kansas City, the police and firemen, saying the Founding Fathers are bad.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:28.562]  In this Glenn Beck news piece, they said, it's horrible, it's like 1776, the Founding Fathers were violent.
[00:34:28.842 --> 00:34:33.244]  And they said, yes, they're gonna get violent, these people are dangerous, they're McVeighs.
[00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:46.259]  The bigger issue here is, if this is a talking point, and it is, is the establishment going to stage events and try to blame it on Ron Paul supporters or on patriots?
[00:34:46.319 --> 00:34:47.620]  And they did it with OKC.
[00:34:48.121 --> 00:34:57.188]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have continual analysis in the second and third hour on this, and we're going to open the phones up after Jesse Benton is on with us in 30 minutes.
[00:34:57.809 --> 00:35:01.352]  Then Steve Quayle joins us, as he did last Friday, to cover this.
[00:35:01.392 --> 00:35:03.634]  This is absolutely incredible.
[00:35:04.779 --> 00:35:11.601]  Now is the time to go to PrisonPlanet.com and order Luce Shane's final cut and get it out to people so they know who carried out the attacks.
[00:35:12.002 --> 00:35:15.903]  And now you'll understand, as we always told you, to set up a police state against the American people.
[00:35:16.403 --> 00:35:21.825]  They are now announcing the entire apparatus of anti-terror is meant for dissenters.
[00:35:22.605 --> 00:35:24.366]  89% of the American people in major polls.
[00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:29.228]  They admit in these newscasts that the people don't trust the media or the government.
[00:35:29.768 --> 00:35:37.172]  Support just like in Romania for Ceausescu or support just like in Italy for El Duce or Mussolini.
[00:35:37.532 --> 00:35:38.433]  It's imploding.
[00:35:38.653 --> 00:35:39.273]  They know it.
[00:35:39.654 --> 00:35:46.237]  They're either going to back off and still fail or they're going to do what dictators and scum always does and go forward.
[00:35:48.510 --> 00:36:02.173]  If we don't intimidate them right back in the Info War, with an Info War Info Bomb, not violent, but Info War, and if we don't let them know we're fully aware of their attack pattern now, as I did right before 9-11, people didn't listen, it happened.
[00:36:02.713 --> 00:36:05.073]  If we don't expose them now, they're gonna move.
[00:36:05.354 --> 00:36:08.454]  I can tell you I have never been so upset.
[00:36:08.614 --> 00:36:12.075]  I have never, never seen anything on this clearer.
[00:36:13.479 --> 00:36:19.124]  I want you to go to PrisonPlanet.com and I want you to get Loose Change Final Cut in Endgame and I want you to make copies of Endgame.
[00:36:19.684 --> 00:36:24.028]  I don't own Loose Change, so you can't do that, but Endgame, I want you to get it.
[00:36:24.128 --> 00:36:25.149]  I want you to make copies.
[00:36:25.169 --> 00:36:28.592]  I want you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:36:28.632 --> 00:36:29.592]  I want you to make copies.
[00:36:30.213 --> 00:36:37.059]  Alright, I got Steve Shank on, ladies and gentlemen, and he is a great sponsor, but he's here to give you information in this segment because
[00:36:38.203 --> 00:36:40.084]  I don't tell you to do things I don't believe in.
[00:36:40.144 --> 00:36:41.005]  I say buy gold.
[00:36:41.105 --> 00:36:43.567]  I say quit drinking fluoride and pesticide water.
[00:36:44.908 --> 00:36:48.210]  I put out basic research information that's real.
[00:36:48.310 --> 00:36:50.252]  This is where I've gotten my storable foods.
[00:36:50.812 --> 00:36:57.457]  He's got a show here on Sunday nights right after my Sunday show from 6 to 8 right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:36:58.644 --> 00:37:02.027]  He is the longest continual operating affordable foods company in the nation.
[00:37:02.427 --> 00:37:05.709]  This is high-quality, dried foods.
[00:37:05.769 --> 00:37:09.692]  This is not that junk made out of soybeans.
[00:37:10.413 --> 00:37:18.399]  And again, we need to get prepared for depressions, recessions, wars, major food prices going up.
[00:37:18.779 --> 00:37:24.984]  Bottom line, this is high-quality investment insurance that you will use, that you can eat.
[00:37:25.684 --> 00:37:28.886]  And with the way inflation's working, you will guaranteed make your money back.
[00:37:29.206 --> 00:37:32.588]  These are tasty foods, high-nutrition foods.
[00:37:33.008 --> 00:37:35.450]  Steve Schenck, things are more serious than ever.
[00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.812]  We need to not be like folks in New Orleans or other areas.
[00:37:38.832 --> 00:37:42.514]  The feds say they'll use food as a weapon to make you turn your guns in.
[00:37:43.534 --> 00:37:48.057]  The more of us are prepared and independent, less of a chance they have for triggering this, Steve.
[00:37:48.789 --> 00:37:57.136]  Well, that's absolutely true, Alex, but the interesting thing that we've got is the most fascinating article that I've read in the last little bit.
[00:37:58.076 --> 00:37:59.197]  It was titled this way.
[00:37:59.618 --> 00:38:04.462]  Gas stations vie for food against grocery stores.
[00:38:05.362 --> 00:38:16.191]  What they're doing is they're turning our food into gas, and we'll be able to drive to the gas station, but we won't be able to drive to the grocery store, but we won't be able to buy anything when we get there.
[00:38:16.934 --> 00:38:26.860]  Now, all your listeners know that we announced this Christmas, or this Holiday Supply, not Christmas, but Holiday Supply, on the last program that we were together on.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:38.026]  And what I'm telling folks is this food that we've set aside is disappearing very quickly because we had a buy on it prior to the price increases that hit like crazy.
[00:38:39.247 --> 00:38:44.229]  I know a lot of people are ordering for their family and they're wanting to get it there by Christmas.
[00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:45.150]  Here's your deadline.
[00:38:46.016 --> 00:38:50.602]  You got to get your orders to us before Thanksgiving.
[00:38:50.622 --> 00:38:54.267]  In other words, the Wednesday, next Wednesday is your cutoff.
[00:38:54.748 --> 00:39:01.978]  If you're going to get those shipments out to your families by Christmas as Christmas gifts, you got to get them there.
[00:39:02.278 --> 00:39:03.440]  Before the cost increase.
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.221]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:05.822 --> 00:39:09.664]  And the thing is, is that what we've done is we've put together a special package for folks.
[00:39:10.145 --> 00:39:17.410]  Now, we've still got the Patriot Pack, which is the two-month grab-and-go, and that one is moving out very quickly, too.
[00:39:17.931 --> 00:39:22.474]  Now, folks, this is not a move to get you to buy from us.
[00:39:23.335 --> 00:39:25.997]  I guarantee you, just as sure as I'm sitting here looking ugly,
[00:39:26.522 --> 00:39:32.125]  That every morsel of food we can get our hands on at the warehouse here at the task force is going to go.
[00:39:32.305 --> 00:39:34.486]  It's not a matter of whether we can sell the junk.
[00:39:34.926 --> 00:39:36.727]  It's a matter of whether you... junk.
[00:39:36.927 --> 00:39:38.167]  That wasn't a good thing to say, Alex.
[00:39:38.207 --> 00:39:40.828]  But anyway, it's not a matter of whether we can move this stuff.
[00:39:41.789 --> 00:39:45.230]  It's a matter of getting it while it's available.
[00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:52.033]  And like I say, for Christmas, you've got to get the orders in by this coming Wednesday.
[00:39:52.334 --> 00:39:52.554]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:59.441]  And realize we've got an avalanche of phone calls.
[00:39:59.961 --> 00:40:01.282]  I need you to be patient.
[00:40:01.862 --> 00:40:06.225]  If you call in and we don't get right to you right away, that's fine.
[00:40:06.425 --> 00:40:09.447]  Give it a shot and make sure that we get the message.
[00:40:09.907 --> 00:40:13.209]  Our little gals will answer the phone and we'll get the message and we'll get back to you.
[00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:14.169]  Honest, we will.
[00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:16.050]  But you've got to get those orders in.
[00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:24.035]  Now, those of you that missed that deadline, we're going to print up certificates that we'll mail out as soon as your order comes in.
[00:40:24.778 --> 00:40:31.445]  To you and you can give them to your friends and neighbors and family or whoever you're ordering for and have them yourself.
[00:40:31.845 --> 00:40:38.371]  You can wrap them up, put them under the Christmas tree and that will be your gift and the shipment will come out after the holidays.
[00:40:39.092 --> 00:40:41.114]  But the fact is, is that you gotta move on.
[00:40:41.194 --> 00:40:43.076]  Now, here's the situation Alex.
[00:40:44.497 --> 00:40:49.242]  We can't, we have a lot of, almost all of your listeners that are attuned to putting in food
[00:40:49.756 --> 00:40:50.917]  are telling me the same story.
[00:40:50.937 --> 00:40:54.300]  They're saying all my friends and relatives and everybody that I know think I'm nuts.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:55.641]  I'm the Lone Ranger.
[00:40:56.322 --> 00:40:59.965]  But you see, these people can't relate to anything in the past.
[00:41:00.526 --> 00:41:04.970]  We have never had a situation in this country where food was in danger.
[00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:10.534]  We have not had the situation where poisoned food was being imported by our enemies.
[00:41:11.455 --> 00:41:11.776]  Okay?
[00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:16.640]  We've never had a situation where genetically poisoned food was being created here
[00:41:17.219 --> 00:41:20.725]  By supposedly our friends, the corporate agriculture groups.
[00:41:21.506 --> 00:41:26.194]  And we've never had a situation where there was going to be no food from American farmers.
[00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:28.439]  Well, I know this.
[00:41:28.639 --> 00:41:31.260]  Mainstream news says that food prices are up about 15%.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.661]  They're going to go up even more next year.
[00:41:34.041 --> 00:41:41.425]  There are shortages of even grains to feed the cattle, because they have been putting it into ethanol.
[00:41:41.925 --> 00:41:44.727]  So we know that there are major price increases coming.
[00:41:45.447 --> 00:41:51.290]  I know that the UN has said in the third world, because of ethanol production out of Brazil and Africa and other places,
[00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:57.672]  It's even going to be worse here because a lot of our people are familiar with the concept of the genetic alteration and the poisoning that's the result of it.
[00:41:57.692 --> 00:41:58.892]  We have cancer, we have diabetes,
[00:42:14.713 --> 00:42:15.554]  We're good to go.
[00:42:31.653 --> 00:42:33.774]  Absolutely, and the thing that we're dealing with, Alex,
[00:42:56.387 --> 00:42:59.328]  Is that people can't discern it.
[00:42:59.368 --> 00:43:03.889]  They can't look at that potato and realize that it is different.
[00:43:03.929 --> 00:43:11.110]  The only result that they'll have is that their bodies will be totally attacked and their immune systems are destroyed.
[00:43:11.530 --> 00:43:15.671]  Now, the whole thing that we're dealing with right now is we're dealing with water.
[00:43:15.731 --> 00:43:17.592]  We have a worldwide famine.
[00:43:17.932 --> 00:43:23.193]  In the United States, we've got people praying all over this country for water.
[00:43:23.888 --> 00:43:26.449]  We've got governors praying, and by the way, it worked.
[00:43:27.170 --> 00:43:30.172]  Well, that's true, but I'll guarantee you one thing.
[00:43:31.212 --> 00:43:43.259]  Within the first three months of this next year, if folks don't listen to what you're saying and what we're trying to talk about with getting a supply of food in so that they have control of their destiny a little bit,
[00:43:44.122 --> 00:43:46.405]  The prayers will not be for water.
[00:43:46.945 --> 00:43:52.551]  They will be, very simply, give us this day some daily bread.
[00:43:52.912 --> 00:43:54.033]  Give them the numbers, Steve.
[00:43:54.073 --> 00:43:54.994]  I don't want to wait.
[00:43:55.014 --> 00:43:56.195]  Give them the number on the websites.
[00:43:56.595 --> 00:43:57.036]  Okay, it's 800-409-5633.
[00:43:57.056 --> 00:43:57.096]  800-409-5633.
[00:44:03.863 --> 00:44:09.166]  And I'll guarantee you'll get a little gal out of Arkansas that's answering the phones for us.
[00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:10.506]  We've got a whole bunch of them.
[00:44:11.227 --> 00:44:12.247]  And be patient.
[00:44:12.267 --> 00:44:14.508]  We will get back to you.
[00:44:15.168 --> 00:44:18.210]  If you have web access, please go to that.
[00:44:19.042 --> 00:44:23.985]  It has all the information, pricing, and everything like that, and we can handle it twice as fast.
[00:44:24.025 --> 00:44:25.306]  Your orders will get in right away.
[00:44:25.706 --> 00:44:29.628]  The website is efoodsdirect.com.
[00:44:29.968 --> 00:44:34.991]  That's the letter E-F-O-O-D-S-D-I-R-E-C-T dot com.
[00:44:35.972 --> 00:44:37.193]  And get up on there.
[00:44:37.233 --> 00:44:38.593]  You'll have a lot of information.
[00:44:38.613 --> 00:44:39.234]  Give them the number.
[00:44:39.254 --> 00:44:39.294]  800-409-5633.
[00:44:40.014 --> 00:44:40.154]  Anyway.
[00:44:45.225 --> 00:45:00.637]  The whole point that we're making, folks, and Alex, I guess I'm really on a campaign with regard to this foolishness of the corn, because let me just give you a couple of pieces of information, and I think it'll be useful.
[00:45:01.077 --> 00:45:05.561]  Do you realize that in a country which is severely short of water,
[00:45:07.682 --> 00:45:16.640]  That corn that they're planting right now depletes the water 25% faster than the ground can bring back up groundwater.
[00:45:17.159 --> 00:45:22.580]  It's depleting our soil 12 times faster than any other crop that you can plant.
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:38.404]  And the idiots that are trying to get this going are now declaring that in addition to the genetic alteration of our foodstuffs, they are going to genetically alter the corn even more so they can get more of it to grow and plant more of it in crops.
[00:45:38.924 --> 00:45:43.685]  Iowa produces 20 percent of all of the corn that's produced in this country.
[00:45:43.885 --> 00:45:44.426]  One-fifth.
[00:45:45.226 --> 00:45:45.966]  And right now
[00:45:46.724 --> 00:45:58.034]  They are in a situation where they, flat out, are having to import corn to feed their livestock because they're wasting so much of our food shoving it into gas tanks.
[00:45:58.174 --> 00:46:00.476]  Well, Steve, let me just give people the basics.
[00:46:00.876 --> 00:46:03.199]  There's talk of massive recession or depression.
[00:46:03.859 --> 00:46:05.941]  There's open talk of war with Iran.
[00:46:06.261 --> 00:46:09.564]  There's open talk of $200 a barrel of oil.
[00:46:09.924 --> 00:46:10.965]  It's gone almost up to $100.
[00:46:11.466 --> 00:46:13.628]  Regardless, look, it's a good move.
[00:46:14.228 --> 00:46:16.190]  It's smart to get water filters.
[00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:18.332]  It's smart to stop eating GMO.
[00:46:18.412 --> 00:46:20.394]  It's smart to not vaccinate your children.
[00:46:20.754 --> 00:46:22.816]  It's smart to have storable foods.
[00:46:22.936 --> 00:46:24.238]  We don't do this because we're in fear.
[00:46:24.598 --> 00:46:27.321]  We do this because we're good stewards and want to take care of our families.
[00:46:29.082 --> 00:46:31.725]  I have a year's supply of food at a bug out point I can go to.
[00:46:31.745 --> 00:46:33.687]  I have a year's supply of food at my house here in Austin.
[00:46:34.247 --> 00:46:35.008]  Yes, we are.
[00:46:54.418 --> 00:46:55.299]  And it could get worse.
[00:46:55.619 --> 00:46:58.182]  But bottom line, this is just a good insurance policy.
[00:46:58.222 --> 00:47:00.724]  I mean, this food is inexpensive, but it's high quality.
[00:47:00.804 --> 00:47:01.385]  I've gotten it.
[00:47:01.865 --> 00:47:12.736]  I mean, explain to people briefly the difference between your food and a lot of the other food, which will nourish you, but it's just, you know, got a lot of sugar and junk in it, or it's made out of the soybean product.
[00:47:12.776 --> 00:47:13.937]  Your stuff isn't that.
[00:47:14.297 --> 00:47:15.619]  Tell them about your food.
[00:47:16.252 --> 00:47:31.765]  Well, basically, the whole concept behind this, Alex, is the suppliers that we work with take food raw, straight out of the garden, and they dry it down with a low heat process so it's still enzyme active, and they store it in such a way that it has a 12 to 15 year shelf life.
[00:47:32.145 --> 00:47:38.991]  And when people eat this stuff, they will actually be eating better than the food that they can order out of the grocery store.
[00:47:39.011 --> 00:47:40.172]  So it's vacuum sealed?
[00:47:40.812 --> 00:47:43.313]  Well, it's actually a CO2 pack.
[00:47:43.353 --> 00:47:58.437]  They take a number 10 can, which is about a gallon, and they fill it with the dried food, it's dried ground, very, very dry, and then they infuse CO2, which eliminates the oxygen out of the can, and then they seal that bugger, and you've got a 12 to 15 year shelf life.
[00:47:58.477 --> 00:48:07.419]  And that's why you can get so much food out of such small containers, because it's all been dried down, and then just added to the water.
[00:48:08.075 --> 00:48:08.976]  Yep, absolutely.
[00:48:09.436 --> 00:48:15.480]  And the main concept here is, you know, you said that you're not saying that all of this will happen.
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:17.541]  Well, I'll tell you what I'm telling folks.
[00:48:17.641 --> 00:48:19.302]  I'm at the supply end of the food chain.
[00:48:19.422 --> 00:48:28.008]  I see things that you can't imagine, Alex, that are so offensive with eliminating our food supply in this country.
[00:48:28.809 --> 00:48:43.512]  I will tell you exactly that by the third month of this next year there will be many many families, a percentage, a high percentage of the families in this country who will not make enough money on their jobs in the day to buy the food that they will eat that day.
[00:48:44.012 --> 00:48:51.457]  Well, I mean, the mainstream media is saying that there is really big food shortages, and it's hard to believe this is actually happening.
[00:48:51.497 --> 00:48:52.717]  It's like a perfect storm.
[00:48:52.757 --> 00:48:54.759]  The bees, half of them dying in the country.
[00:48:55.519 --> 00:48:58.301]  The oil price is going up, so it's more to ship the food.
[00:48:59.101 --> 00:49:02.503]  The petrochemicals go into the fertilizers, so it's more to fertilize them.
[00:49:02.764 --> 00:49:04.164]  The water prices are up.
[00:49:04.485 --> 00:49:06.146]  The dollar's been devalued.
[00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:09.468]  I mean, you add all this together, it is, I guess, the facts.
[00:49:09.568 --> 00:49:11.529]  I just am hoping it's not that bad.
[00:49:12.049 --> 00:49:25.898]  Well, it comes down to the fact that unless people get their food supply in, there will come a point, and it's not very far away, it's very, very, very soon,
[00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:32.936]  Uh, that they will either not be able to afford it, but it will not be, or it will not be there.
[00:49:32.976 --> 00:49:50.172]  Well, there's no doubt with the massive inflation that we've got more and more old folks eating dog food and the rest of it, which is just filled with all sorts of toxic things, and every week or two I see an article about a whole meat plant that also makes dog food in the same plant, you know, shipping out to hundreds of thousands of cans of botulism.
[00:49:50.413 --> 00:49:51.694]  That was barely in the news.
[00:49:52.334 --> 00:49:56.416]  They're on CNBC saying mercury and lead and toys are good for you.
[00:49:56.816 --> 00:50:16.646]  I mean it's just it's it's getting and I'm not kidding folks we played that newscast they say it's good for the country I mean it's it's like mass mental illness has seized us and I just know with all these questions out there I know I was prepared years ago I'm getting more prepared and I know I've talked to you off-air Steve you are having a lot of trouble you did do massive food buys a few months ago and
[00:50:18.584 --> 00:50:21.046]  I just hope that we can still have you as a sponsor next year.
[00:50:21.066 --> 00:50:23.427]  I hope you've got food to sell.
[00:50:24.008 --> 00:50:25.369]  Let me put it this way.
[00:50:25.469 --> 00:50:28.911]  A lot of folks put in gold and silver, and that's a wise move.
[00:50:29.411 --> 00:50:32.914]  But when they ask me, I tell them to put in food first, because here's the deal.
[00:50:33.507 --> 00:50:38.430]  The only thing that folks that put in gold and silver will use it to buy is food.
[00:50:38.891 --> 00:50:40.351]  Give him your number.
[00:50:40.371 --> 00:50:51.979]  800-409-5633 800-409-5633 efoodsdirect.com And we got big links at the top of prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:50:52.359 --> 00:50:53.760]  Steve, it's scary.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.621]  I can't say I disagree with you.
[00:50:55.641 --> 00:50:56.722]  Thank you so much for coming on.
[00:50:57.102 --> 00:50:58.083]  Hey, have a good one, Larry.
[00:50:58.563 --> 00:50:59.003]  God bless you.
[00:50:59.023 --> 00:50:59.864]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[00:51:01.385 --> 00:51:02.746]  It is a big idea
[00:51:03.835 --> 00:51:04.916]  A new world order.
[00:51:05.616 --> 00:51:09.858]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful group of governments.
[00:51:10.519 --> 00:51:12.260]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:15.601]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[00:51:16.122 --> 00:51:18.503]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.307 --> 00:51:26.658]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:29.663 --> 00:51:34.610]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:38.572]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:38.972 --> 00:51:41.493]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world, doesn't he?
[00:51:41.533 --> 00:51:42.674]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:42.694 --> 00:51:43.454]  They're not after money.
[00:51:43.474 --> 00:51:44.555]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:44.755 --> 00:51:45.515]  They're after power.
[00:51:45.735 --> 00:51:46.876]  That's what they're after, you see.
[00:51:46.896 --> 00:51:51.438]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.081]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:58.401 --> 00:51:59.462]  You have been warned.
[00:52:00.592 --> 00:52:03.754]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:52:03.794 --> 00:52:07.837]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:52:07.977 --> 00:52:10.539]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:52:10.599 --> 00:52:12.920]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:52:13.101 --> 00:52:21.546]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:52:21.626 --> 00:52:22.927]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:52:23.067 --> 00:52:27.090]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:52:27.110 --> 00:52:27.570]  We're good to go!
[00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:50.543]  Let's get the Advanced Berkey Light Purifier for only $279 by calling New Millennium.
[00:52:50.563 --> 00:52:52.185]  888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:52.205 --> 00:52:53.146]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:00.228 --> 00:53:03.149]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:53:03.309 --> 00:53:08.470]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:53:08.830 --> 00:53:14.091]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:14.551 --> 00:53:15.672]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:16.032 --> 00:53:24.974]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:53:25.354 --> 00:53:26.956]  Now compare Calben Pure Soap.

[00:54:05.797 --> 00:54:06.637]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:54:06.717 --> 00:54:16.440]  If you missed that number, see if eFoodsDirect, it's 800-409-5633, 1-800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com.
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:18.401]  And look, I'm just giving you advice that I follow.
[00:54:18.681 --> 00:54:20.302]  It's a good company, high quality food.
[00:54:20.322 --> 00:54:21.202]  It's where I get my food.
[00:54:21.262 --> 00:54:26.504]  I'm going to buy for all of my family, I think those two-month boogie packs.
[00:54:26.564 --> 00:54:28.404]  And my family isn't laughing now.
[00:54:28.424 --> 00:54:31.125]  I mean, they're pretty smart, but at least people have that as a supplement.
[00:54:32.242 --> 00:54:33.943]  I don't know if it's all going to unravel like that.
[00:54:33.963 --> 00:54:52.914]  I know they're admitting food shortages, and I've seen in the news that one field of corn, the amount that it takes, the amount of hectares or acres it takes of corn to produce the fuel for a car for a year, is the amount of food people would eat, seven people would eat in a year, per car.
[00:54:54.122 --> 00:55:02.489]  And yeah, he was talking about during the break, going, I wish I'd have told him about this, and I did see this in the news, how they're genetically engineering new corn crops that aren't even edible.
[00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:04.531]  They're just for fuel.
[00:55:05.071 --> 00:55:13.719]  And then he mentioned how hemp is many, many, many times better for the conversion you get for ethanol, but they won't let you grow it here.
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:21.205]  And again, that's hemp that doesn't have THC in it, that won't get you, quote, stoned, as the potheads call it.
[00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:25.976]  It's just, it's amazing, the perfect storm of things that are happening.
[00:55:26.958 --> 00:55:28.860]  On the good side, things are going to be rough next year.
[00:55:29.541 --> 00:55:30.422]  They're already getting rough.
[00:55:31.103 --> 00:55:39.575]  On the bad side, I just know this, little hole-in-the-wall breakfast places, you know, one person eating is ten bucks and it was five bucks a year ago.
[00:55:41.107 --> 00:55:43.469]  So it's a lot of things conspiring together.
[00:55:43.489 --> 00:55:46.751]  That's why I got him back up here on the show.
[00:55:46.851 --> 00:55:50.713]  Okay, the big news of the day, the news that I'm going to be talking about.
[00:55:50.773 --> 00:55:52.635]  Let's just get Jesse Benton on right now.
[00:55:52.675 --> 00:55:54.676]  Let's get him on right when I start the next hour.
[00:55:56.217 --> 00:55:57.298]  Jesse Benton, Ron Paul 2008.
[00:55:59.099 --> 00:56:02.261]  He's their spokesman, media coordinator.
[00:56:04.870 --> 00:56:22.653]  I've got to calm down and go through this slowly, but the first time you're going to hear his take, it'll be humble and gentlemanly and, well, we wish they wouldn't call Ron Paul supporters terrorists and say we're in bed with Al-Qaeda and Islamic fascists, and we wish they wouldn't talk about using the military against us and saying Ron Paul's dividing America.
[00:56:22.673 --> 00:56:27.014]  I mean, think of the outrageousness!
[00:56:27.094 --> 00:56:34.355]  I mean, it's one thing to say Iraq was behind 9-11 when they weren't, even if you believe the official story, and to say Iran's behind it when they're the opposite group.
[00:56:35.089 --> 00:56:36.330]  They're Shiite, not Sunni.
[00:56:37.290 --> 00:56:39.691]  Al-Qaeda, if you believe that it even exists, is Sunni.
[00:56:41.372 --> 00:56:48.995]  But to say the American people, when 89% disagree with Congress now, that's the Gallup poll.
[00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:51.576]  And many other polls show the exact same number.
[00:56:53.197 --> 00:56:54.197]  But it's upwards of 90%.
[00:56:54.257 --> 00:56:54.818]  Now let's say it's 80%.
[00:56:55.978 --> 00:56:56.378]  Let's give them 20%.
[00:56:56.418 --> 00:56:56.378]  80%.
[00:56:56.478 --> 00:56:57.559]  Let's be conservative.
[00:56:57.599 --> 00:56:58.219]  We're all terrorists?
[00:57:03.402 --> 00:57:06.745]  But all you dirty Trotskyites, you know everything?
[00:57:06.765 --> 00:57:10.248]  All you dirty foreigners that came over here?
[00:57:10.268 --> 00:57:12.890]  And I'm sorry, that's what these Soviets are.
[00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:16.053]  I'm not talking about the Russian people or Poles or anybody like that.
[00:57:16.093 --> 00:57:18.695]  I mean the dirty New World Order types.
[00:57:18.775 --> 00:57:24.200]  I mean, Madeleine Albright's father admittedly killed over a million people and ran the Czechoslovakian purges.
[00:57:25.174 --> 00:57:26.114]  That's mainstream news.
[00:57:26.134 --> 00:57:26.695]  It was in the news.
[00:57:26.995 --> 00:57:33.798]  She got in trouble when 60 Minutes was at her house because somebody saw all these stolen paintings from people in Czechoslovakia on the walls.
[00:57:33.918 --> 00:57:35.058]  People that were sent to death camps.
[00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:43.582]  And you got Chertoff's family running ops in Russia and leading back to the new Attorney General.
[00:57:43.622 --> 00:57:45.682]  I mean, you couldn't make this type of stuff up.
[00:57:48.664 --> 00:57:54.086]  And then you got little simpletons, little government pimps
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:01.045]  Like Glenn Beck, who established his cred being anti-New World Order a little bit, and then now has completely flipped.
[00:58:01.845 --> 00:58:11.513]  Well, I don't know about the North American Union, but criticizing the government in a time of war aids Al-Qaeda, and you're with Al-Qaeda, and you groups, I think, are dangerous, like McVeigh, and you're planning to kill people.
[00:58:11.813 --> 00:58:13.134]  You're just out of the blue.
[00:58:13.154 --> 00:58:14.195]  He just pulls it out of a hat.
[00:58:14.235 --> 00:58:15.116]  He didn't pull it out of a hat.
[00:58:15.376 --> 00:58:16.957]  It's a White House memo.
[00:58:19.339 --> 00:58:21.241]  It's a White House plan.
[00:58:26.178 --> 00:58:29.121]  We're going to get Jesse Benton on to talk about this and I'm going to go through analysis on it.
[00:58:29.481 --> 00:58:30.882]  Take your phone calls as well.
[00:58:31.563 --> 00:58:35.166]  WeAreChange.org in New York has done a great job confronting Larry Silverstein.
[00:58:35.226 --> 00:58:38.529]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and WeAreChange.org right now too.
[00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:39.670]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:58:56.872 --> 00:59:01.056]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:59:01.696 --> 00:59:02.537]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.277 --> 00:59:04.238]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.839 --> 00:59:08.642]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.022 --> 00:59:13.165]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.569 --> 00:59:19.611]  We've got the Super Double
[00:59:20.811 --> 00:59:24.634]  Heather Moneybomb coming up the 16th and 17th of December.
[00:59:24.654 --> 00:59:36.762]  They raised the record $4.2 million in pre-election time, pre-nomination time, pre-primary time.
[00:59:37.362 --> 00:59:38.403]  Searching for that word.
[00:59:39.244 --> 00:59:41.986]  We need a continual stream of support to Ron Paul.
[00:59:42.026 --> 00:59:42.786]  I know that's happening.
[00:59:42.806 --> 00:59:46.168]  I see his money raising is right on cue for what it was before the Moneybomb.
[00:59:46.209 --> 00:59:47.990]  We need to double that.
[00:59:48.667 --> 00:59:50.008]  To 10 million.
[00:59:50.068 --> 01:00:00.776]  I know we can at least get 8 million on those two days, the 16th and 17th, and a sign bomb and a demonstration bomb, rally bomb, on that Saturday.
[01:00:01.416 --> 01:00:04.458]  And so, more articles at PrisonPlanet.com coming out on that.
[01:00:05.079 --> 01:00:09.402]  Also, I know the Ron Paul campaign has launched their own video contest.
[01:00:09.482 --> 01:00:11.043]  We're launching one of those as well.
[01:00:11.363 --> 01:00:12.484]  You need to launch your own.
[01:00:13.024 --> 01:00:16.847]  But to shut up and actually go to Jesse Benton, I'm frothing here with excitement,
[01:00:17.487 --> 01:00:17.667]  I think?
[01:00:32.475 --> 01:00:39.001]  They are in bed, quote, with Islamo-fascists and aiding terrorists and he hopes we're not going to stage any events.
[01:00:39.101 --> 01:00:43.505]  I mean, this is outrageous defamation and slander.
[01:00:43.866 --> 01:00:46.588]  Jesse Benton, Communications Director, RonPaul2008.com.
[01:00:46.608 --> 01:00:47.810]  We'll have him into the next segment with us.
[01:00:48.270 --> 01:00:50.172]  But sir, right now, what did you think of seeing this?
[01:00:50.934 --> 01:00:53.455]  Well, you know, I would like to say this.
[01:00:53.895 --> 01:00:58.177]  I think it was David Horowitz that was really saying the really over-the-top stuff.
[01:00:59.578 --> 01:01:07.001]  Mr. Horowitz, he's just a slanderer, and I think he has absolutely zero credibility, if he wants to go ahead and attack Ron.
[01:01:07.381 --> 01:01:16.225]  I think the ironic thing about Mr. Beck is that he says so many of the things that Ron Paul supporters and Dr. Paul himself talk about all the time, so we can't have the
[01:01:16.565 --> 01:01:22.787]  We can't have the federal government printing money out of thin air that both political parties have sold out to corporatists.
[01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:30.650]  So it really strikes me as a little bit ironic that he feels the need to attack Ron like that.
[01:01:33.835 --> 01:01:54.358]  But this is a major turning point, because I have seen similar statements about the anti-war crowd, which is the majority of Americans, libertarian groups, you know, even if you don't agree with it, 9-11 truth groups, they have the First Amendment right, and I'm seeing this as a talking point, sir, and then we discovered a White House talking point to the State Department declassified last year,
[01:01:54.898 --> 01:01:56.700]  Well, uh, you know, Ron does say time and time again that, uh,
[01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:14.613]  One of the greatest threats that we face right now is the threat that we're imposing on ourselves.
[01:02:15.494 --> 01:02:22.019]  Our need to feel hyper-secure is putting a great strain on our civil liberties, the freedoms that have made America so great.
[01:02:22.359 --> 01:02:25.522]  And that's probably the biggest challenge that we face right now.
[01:02:26.943 --> 01:02:32.087]  Well, Ron Paul on this show many times and on national television has repeatedly said that we're in danger of martial law.
[01:02:32.107 --> 01:02:35.209]  The John Warner Defense Authorization Act funds martial law.
[01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:38.332]  I mean, inside the campaign, are you guys talking about this?
[01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:45.581]  You know, Ron does talk about that, and it's not the central issue of our campaign, per se.
[01:02:45.621 --> 01:03:00.064]  We're trying to spread the message of freedom, peace, and prosperity, but the groundwork is being laid for martial law in the future, and just think all you Republicans out there that have handed these tools over to Bush, because he's our guy.
[01:03:00.384 --> 01:03:06.985]  Think about what could happen under Hillary Clinton if we don't have the protection of posse comitatus.
[01:03:07.765 --> 01:03:16.550]  You know, if Hillary Clinton can declare a state of national emergency over something just like an outbreak of a flu epidemic, that should really scare the crap out of a lot of Republicans.
[01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:17.911]  That is an excellent point.
[01:03:17.951 --> 01:03:19.371]  You know, I forget to make that one.
[01:03:19.772 --> 01:03:24.454]  That is a really central point, is that these powers don't go away, they just accrue.
[01:03:24.954 --> 01:03:26.315]  Right, exactly, exactly.
[01:03:26.675 --> 01:03:33.879]  And, you know, it's one thing, you know, it's Republicans, we have our guy in there right now, but just think, you know, we're not always going to have a Republican president.
[01:03:33.899 --> 01:03:36.921]  How are Republicans going to think when we've got a Democrat in there?
[01:03:37.748 --> 01:03:38.288]  Absolutely.
[01:03:38.308 --> 01:03:48.755]  Jesse Benton, stay with us a few minutes on the other side to talk more about this piece and also strategies and how people can really help the Ron Paul 2008 campaign that, I don't have to tell Jesse Benton, has taken off like a rocket.
[01:03:48.775 --> 01:03:49.735]  It's incredible.
[01:03:49.795 --> 01:03:50.196]  Stay with us.
[01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:54.398]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:56.539]  A new world order.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:01.282]  In the near future, birth is dominated by power.
[01:04:01.382 --> 01:04:03.884]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:04:04.104 --> 01:04:07.126]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:04:07.754 --> 01:04:10.197]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:10.917 --> 01:04:18.245]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:21.257 --> 01:04:26.260]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:26.741 --> 01:04:30.223]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:33.105]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:33.145 --> 01:04:34.306]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:34.326 --> 01:04:35.086]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.106 --> 01:04:36.187]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:36.387 --> 01:04:37.148]  They're after power.
[01:04:37.368 --> 01:04:38.509]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:05:48.112 --> 01:05:50.755]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:05:51.997 --> 01:05:55.318]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:05:55.658 --> 01:06:02.559]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:06:02.939 --> 01:06:15.421]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:06:15.661 --> 01:06:18.302]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:06:18.662 --> 01:06:24.844]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:06:25.084 --> 01:06:30.225]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:06:30.465 --> 01:06:38.727]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:06:38.927 --> 01:06:39.567]  And the best part?
[01:06:39.807 --> 01:06:41.808]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:06:42.068 --> 01:06:44.330]  Simply go to 321relief.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:06:44.350 --> 01:06:45.471]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.491 --> 01:06:46.812]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:46.832 --> 01:06:47.192]  To be clear,
[01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:13.429]  Glenn Beck in three different clips I've seen on YouTube in the last month has said, Ron Paul, you know, he's like a book.
[01:07:13.449 --> 01:07:14.289]  Look at his cover.
[01:07:14.349 --> 01:07:15.530]  The people aren't buying.
[01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:16.391]  He's not good.
[01:07:16.471 --> 01:07:17.492]  People don't want him.
[01:07:17.832 --> 01:07:19.433]  He's obviously an enemy of Ron Paul.
[01:07:19.954 --> 01:07:21.515]  He's a fake libertarian.
[01:07:21.975 --> 01:07:25.218]  He'll talk about a few issues, but then not actually give you solutions to them.
[01:07:25.258 --> 01:07:30.122]  He'll say he's against the North American Union, but then basically then push people that are for it.
[01:07:31.221 --> 01:07:32.223]  But David Horowitz.
[01:07:32.243 --> 01:07:33.806]  We were just talking about David Horowitz.
[01:07:34.468 --> 01:07:37.694]  I mean, in this Beck thing, he comes out and says the military's got to deal with this.
[01:07:37.774 --> 01:07:38.355]  It's their oath.
[01:07:40.149 --> 01:07:43.911]  Mainline libertarian groups are in bed with Islamofascists.
[01:07:44.811 --> 01:07:47.132]  The Founding Fathers, oh, they're so dangerous.
[01:07:47.152 --> 01:07:48.873]  They even lumped the Founding Fathers in.
[01:07:49.553 --> 01:07:59.638]  Watching this clip yesterday, Jesse Bitton from the Ron Paul 2008 campaign communications director, I couldn't believe I was watching it.
[01:07:59.678 --> 01:08:02.399]  I mean, this was... How dumb do they think the public are?
[01:08:03.716 --> 01:08:15.706]  Well, you know, David Horwitz, I can't link this directly to him, but on a website that he runs, they had a phony event on a date that didn't exist.
[01:08:15.766 --> 01:08:29.478]  I believe it was September, it was supposed to be a rally on September 31st, obviously there is no system for September 31st, an event that was never planned, but it was supposed to be Ron Paul, Dennis Kucinich, and Indy Sheehan at an anti-war rally.
[01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:42.885]  And these things were on a website that Horace runs, and flyers were printed off and handed out on college campuses as just a real blatant, ugly propaganda tool to try to smear Ron Paul.
[01:08:42.965 --> 01:08:51.930]  So, I don't know exactly what actions people are trying to grind, but it's pretty clear that they're desperate to try to stop Ron, and they'll do whatever it takes in there.
[01:08:52.391 --> 01:08:57.013]  Yeah, the sites that carried it were Front Page Magazine, that's the main little... That's it.
[01:08:58.911 --> 01:09:00.012]  Well, they've got a problem, though.
[01:09:00.032 --> 01:09:01.714]  They've been posing as conservatives.
[01:09:01.994 --> 01:09:04.356]  They've always been elitists and command and controllers.
[01:09:04.737 --> 01:09:10.362]  The whole Straussian school that the neocons follow is for a command and control system.
[01:09:10.723 --> 01:09:12.004]  And I think they've got a problem.
[01:09:12.084 --> 01:09:15.167]  I think that they've revealed themselves as fake conservatives.
[01:09:15.927 --> 01:09:17.628]  Well, I think they're heartbreak conservative.
[01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:23.172]  I mean, the last time I checked, conservatism meant you stood for limited government, for smaller government.
[01:09:23.512 --> 01:09:24.933]  These people, they want big government.
[01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.134]  They want the Patriot Act.
[01:09:26.154 --> 01:09:26.994]  They want control.
[01:09:27.054 --> 01:09:28.155]  They want wiretapping.
[01:09:28.175 --> 01:09:29.656]  They want expanded entitlement.
[01:09:30.096 --> 01:09:37.381]  And they want to be able to impose their version of morality onto the American people through the force of the federal government.
[01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:39.182]  That doesn't sound very conservative to me.
[01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:40.957]  I think?
[01:10:12.238 --> 01:10:19.083]  Well, I just think that's a really big reach, and I'd like to think that Mr. Beck isn't really serious about that.
[01:10:19.543 --> 01:10:25.127]  We're actually working to find out a mutual time in the schedules that we can get Ron on with Glenn.
[01:10:25.167 --> 01:10:31.311]  We've been actually doing that for a while, and it just fell through a couple times because of really difficult scheduling.
[01:10:31.331 --> 01:10:37.795]  So I'm confident and very hopeful that when Ron and Glenn Beck sit down and actually talk, that it'll be positive.
[01:10:39.876 --> 01:10:44.218]  I think Glenn Beck's got enough of a conservative backbone to be able to stand up.
[01:10:44.258 --> 01:10:48.640]  It's this David Horowitz, I think, that just really takes it too far, and it's pretty unconscionable.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.120]  Well, it's dangerous, too.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:57.963]  I mean, there are a lot of nut cases out there, and you start saying libertarians and anti-war people are aiding terrorists, some nuts might do something.
[01:10:58.023 --> 01:11:05.026]  I mean, they're the ones talking about how we're violent, we might do something violent when we've done... Libertarians and anti-war people have done nothing violent.
[01:11:07.026 --> 01:11:08.087]  I mean, that's outrageous.
[01:11:08.947 --> 01:11:10.968]  I think so too.
[01:11:11.869 --> 01:11:21.774]  Accusing people of being violent or being terrorists because they don't fully support and embrace all the actions of our federal government is just preposterous.
[01:11:21.794 --> 01:11:27.136]  A true patriot is always questioning his government.
[01:11:27.176 --> 01:11:29.137]  A government doesn't supply freedom and liberty.
[01:11:29.178 --> 01:11:32.759]  A government is usually an obstacle to freedom and liberty.
[01:11:32.799 --> 01:11:35.781]  A government is supposed to be as limited and small as possible.
[01:11:36.381 --> 01:11:53.343]  And, you know, we're supposed to try to restrain our government, so conservatives that look to government to solve our problems and think that, you know, opposition or questioning of the policies of our government is unpatriotic, they really just need to re-examine what patriotism really is.
[01:11:53.883 --> 01:12:01.848]  Well, also, it's clear that when you're over the target, you get the flak, the old World War II saying, from the bombers over the German targets in Europe.
[01:12:02.788 --> 01:12:16.137]  The fact that there's clearly a White House talking point, we even have it back to September 2006, saying, call people who are against administration policies terrorists, say they're with terrorists.
[01:12:16.617 --> 01:12:20.119]  It's a clear talking point now with O'Reilly and Hannity and Beck.
[01:12:20.659 --> 01:12:23.402]  I think you're hitting the nail right on the head there, Alex.
[01:12:23.422 --> 01:12:24.863]  The attacks are ratcheting it up.
[01:12:24.903 --> 01:12:25.624]  It's going to get worse.
[01:12:25.644 --> 01:12:27.045]  There are going to be more attacks.
[01:12:27.065 --> 01:12:27.906]  They're going to be more vicious.
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:51.708]  I think that one thing that's particularly positive about this is that they haven't been able to attack Ron personally because they don't have anything they can attack him on personally.
[01:12:51.948 --> 01:12:56.712]  So they're trying to attack people that are close to him or people that pretend to be close to him.
[01:12:56.732 --> 01:13:07.202]  You know, with the campaign we've got some people to try to latch on that really aren't associated with the campaign and whose views aren't affiliated with ours.
[01:13:07.902 --> 01:13:08.724]  We're good to go.
[01:13:19.355 --> 01:13:24.738]  Well Jesse, expanding on that, are you calling for Horowitz to retract and apologize?
[01:13:24.778 --> 01:13:32.402]  Also his front page mag coming out and claiming that Paul is with Kucinich and Sheehan at imaginary events that never existed?
[01:13:33.602 --> 01:13:40.146]  We tried to reach out and contact them and his staff when this was going on and we didn't receive any reply.
[01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:44.608]  No, we're not going to ask to retract.
[01:13:44.648 --> 01:13:45.989]  We're not even going to dignify it.
[01:13:46.429 --> 01:13:49.570]  We'll just let people know, address it as it comes up.
[01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:55.994]  But I wouldn't expect him to offer any retraction or apology, so I'm not even going to waste my breath.
[01:13:56.713 --> 01:14:05.961]  Now, I'm sure you know, Zogby came out yesterday, the head of Zogby, the owner, and said that Ron Paul could win New Hampshire.
[01:14:06.501 --> 01:14:22.135]  Can you give us the numbers you're getting there now, and what the trends are showing, and what we as grassroots activists from the entire political spectrum that are supporting Dr. Paul and this campaign of liberty and freedom, this message of freedom, what can we do?
[01:14:22.915 --> 01:14:26.639]  Well, you know, I hate to say it, but just keep doing what you're doing.
[01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:32.484]  I mean, this really, everything is growing wildly with the paid media, the earned media, the grassroots outreach.
[01:14:32.524 --> 01:14:33.564]  It's really been tremendous.
[01:14:33.685 --> 01:14:37.348]  And I'll put a little bit of perspective on it for you, Alex.
[01:14:37.448 --> 01:14:42.112]  You know, it's probably going to be about 200,000 people to come out and vote in this New Hampshire primary.
[01:14:42.372 --> 01:14:44.474]  The 220,000 came out in 2000.
[01:14:44.514 --> 01:14:48.077]  I expect the Republican primary to be a little bit depressed this year.
[01:14:48.097 --> 01:14:49.058]  So probably about 200,000 total voters.
[01:14:51.101 --> 01:14:56.545]  So, to win this thing, Ron Paul probably needs about 45 to 50,000 raw votes.
[01:14:56.605 --> 01:14:58.946]  That's all we need to do, turnout.
[01:14:59.367 --> 01:15:04.991]  50,000 people to vote for Ron Paul in New Hampshire on probably January 8th.
[01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:08.213]  I think that makes it seem a lot more attainable, a lot more winnable.
[01:15:08.653 --> 01:15:22.096]  So, every single person that we can touch and contact and urge to go vote, every single credible New Hampshire Republican or Independent that we can touch and reach out to and spread the message and say, please go vote for Dr. Paul.
[01:15:22.116 --> 01:15:25.777]  You know, the future of America depends on you going and voting for Dr. Paul.
[01:15:25.837 --> 01:15:28.177]  All we need to do is get 50,000 of these folks out.
[01:15:28.478 --> 01:15:30.198]  That makes it sound a lot more winnable, doesn't it?
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:40.167]  Well, if you live around New Hampshire, on the states bordering it, or you live in New Hampshire, ladies and gentlemen, we have thousands of listeners in New Hampshire from this show alone.
[01:15:40.267 --> 01:15:55.558]  If you will get the signs, get the stickers, knock on 50 doors a weekend, if you will do this for America, we can vault Ron Paul into the first or second place position, and then from there, they're already having to admit he's a first-tier candidate now.
[01:15:55.918 --> 01:15:57.660]  And the final question, the money bomb.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.201]  Or the huge fundraising that took place.
[01:16:00.601 --> 01:16:08.603]  We need to point out that Horowitz, again, was disingenuous and said that Ron Paul worships Guy Fawkes, basically, and that Ron Paul chose this day.
[01:16:08.943 --> 01:16:12.604]  When, by the way, it was chosen because of V for Vendetta, not even that date.
[01:16:12.664 --> 01:16:14.065]  Remember the 5th of November.
[01:16:14.085 --> 01:16:15.565]  So that's a misrepresentation as well.
[01:16:15.805 --> 01:16:16.966]  Ron Paul didn't do that.
[01:16:16.986 --> 01:16:18.146]  The campaign didn't run that.
[01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:20.627]  The campaign wasn't even aware of it until a few weeks before.
[01:16:20.667 --> 01:16:21.247]  Is that accurate?
[01:16:21.787 --> 01:16:22.507]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:22.707 --> 01:16:24.148]  We found out about it on the internet.
[01:16:24.548 --> 01:16:25.188]  We didn't choose it.
[01:16:25.208 --> 01:16:28.489]  I think it was actually a very clever marketing technique.
[01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:32.089]  What do you think of the money bomb idea for the 16th and 17th?
[01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:33.950]  I think it sounds like a great idea.
[01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:40.471]  I hope we have an even better day, an even better money bomb than we did on the 5th.
[01:16:40.831 --> 01:16:48.153]  And I'd also encourage people to remember that the campaign, in addition to these bombs and these bursts and one-day surges,
[01:16:48.513 --> 01:16:51.914]  We also need a steady money stream too to be able to run our operations.
[01:16:52.135 --> 01:16:57.517]  We've really ramped up our paid media based on our hope to really have a great fundraising quarter.
[01:16:57.557 --> 01:17:00.618]  So, you know, pay attention to the money bomb, to the money surge.
[01:17:00.638 --> 01:17:02.098]  Hope you participate in that also.
[01:17:02.299 --> 01:17:08.901]  Hope that people will continue to dedicate and have their friends or neighbors that they donate to on a regular basis.
[01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:10.662]  How much are you spending in New Hampshire?
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:17.927]  Well, I can just say we had a 1.1 million dollar media buy and we bumped our staff up to over 10 now.
[01:17:18.067 --> 01:17:19.448]  So we're putting out a lot of money.
[01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:21.750]  There's a lot of other expenses to go on too.
[01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.692]  So you've got 10 in New Hampshire?
[01:17:24.113 --> 01:17:24.934]  10 in New Hampshire, yes.
[01:17:26.035 --> 01:17:27.716]  New Hampshire's just going great.
[01:17:29.013 --> 01:17:49.694]  But what about, I mean I know that you can't get into managing the offices and that's the danger, because then they can put out things that aren't officially, you know, in Ron Paul's policy and his campaign platform, but what about just people not waiting for orders from headquarters, but going to the sound of the guns and setting up their own offices and going wild in New Hampshire?
[01:17:50.792 --> 01:18:02.677]  You know, I have always, the entire campaign, Dr. Paul has been just amazed and flattered and humbled by the tremendous independent grassroots supporters activity.
[01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:13.322]  And if folks want to go ahead and do that, you know, with their own creativity and energy, you know, the campaign would certainly not stand in their way.
[01:18:13.362 --> 01:18:16.763]  We just continue to be amazed by what people are doing out there on their own.
[01:18:17.532 --> 01:18:19.394]  And then what are the other key states coming up?
[01:18:20.115 --> 01:18:23.978]  Well, of course there's Nevada, which is a caucus state, early caucus state.
[01:18:23.998 --> 01:18:25.600]  We're focused a lot of energy out there.
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:28.342]  And then South Carolina is our final big focus state.
[01:18:29.183 --> 01:18:42.516]  Okay, I'm going to let you go, Jesse, but I want to talk to you for 30 seconds during the break about other guests from the campaign I can get on and find out who's official and who isn't, because I've got a few names bumping around here I want to get on as we intensify the last month and a half run up to New Hampshire.
[01:18:53.875 --> 01:18:57.695]  As many people know, ever since President Nixon took us off the gold standard, the U.S.
[01:18:57.735 --> 01:18:59.016]  dollar has been devaluating.
[01:18:59.156 --> 01:19:02.736]  What people don't know, however, is how this directly affects your personal finances.
[01:19:03.016 --> 01:19:05.537]  Is there a way to prevent your portfolios from losing value?
[01:19:05.937 --> 01:19:07.697]  The answer to all of this is gold and silver.
[01:19:08.017 --> 01:19:10.298]  They have both maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years.
[01:19:11.378 --> 01:19:21.823]  If you had had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept them both until now, your cash would actually have the buying power of only $4,800.
[01:19:22.103 --> 01:19:25.805]  But your gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000.
[01:19:25.865 --> 01:19:28.946]  The answer to protecting your assets is simple.
[01:19:29.146 --> 01:19:31.608]  Call me, John Ballman, today at 1-800-686-2237, extension 169.
[01:19:31.708 --> 01:19:34.669]  Get all your questions answered before your money is worth zero.
[01:19:34.689 --> 01:19:34.849]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:41.852]  We're good to go.
[01:20:08.527 --> 01:20:09.047]  I think so.
[01:20:35.452 --> 01:20:40.418]  Remember, vacuum packaging this food will have at least a five-year shelf life stored in a cool, dark, dry place.
[01:20:40.618 --> 01:20:43.782]  Holidays are coming, and this would make a perfect gift for friends and family.
[01:20:43.842 --> 01:20:48.427]  Call today, 908-691-2608 at hempusa.org.
[01:20:48.588 --> 01:20:52.132]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:53.396]  Hi, Ken.
[01:20:53.437 --> 01:20:54.217]  It's Judy again.
[01:20:54.237 --> 01:20:58.761]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:02.043]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[01:21:02.283 --> 01:21:04.165]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[01:21:04.425 --> 01:21:06.507]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[01:21:06.687 --> 01:21:12.791]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[01:21:12.992 --> 01:21:18.296]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[01:21:18.556 --> 01:21:21.418]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[01:21:21.538 --> 01:21:22.479]  Go KenSolar!
[01:21:23.749 --> 01:21:25.290]  Get the best of both worlds.
[01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:30.793]  Solar power for your household essentials and a backup generator all-in-one.

[01:21:36.896 --> 01:21:39.578]  Lower your electric bill and be prepared year-round.

[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.902]  See the complete solar power generator kit at KenSolar.com.
[01:21:47.062 --> 01:21:50.884]  Order your solar power generator from Ken's website at KenSolar.com.
[01:21:53.105 --> 01:21:54.945]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:55.085 --> 01:22:00.266]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:22:00.426 --> 01:22:01.787]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:22:02.047 --> 01:22:10.208]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:22:10.428 --> 01:22:16.209]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:22:16.229 --> 01:22:18.110]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:20.290]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:24.735]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:22:24.895 --> 01:22:27.038]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:22:27.118 --> 01:22:34.906]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.448]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:59.751 --> 01:23:03.013]  Alright, coming up in the next segment, we're going to try to open the phones up.
[01:23:03.653 --> 01:23:07.635]  I want to briefly recap the key information we were just discussing.
[01:23:08.935 --> 01:23:16.839]  What this means, if they're now trying to say that anybody that disagrees with the war, or says 9-11 is an inside job, or is a libertarian, is Al-Qaeda.
[01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:28.565]  They're saying we are completely in bed with Islamofascism, Beck agreeing, Beck talking bad about the Founding Fathers, Beck saying Crip should be used against the American people.
[01:23:29.525 --> 01:23:31.086]  This is just outrageous.
[01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:32.687]  O'Reilly's saying similar things.
[01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.108]  Others saying similar things.
[01:23:35.049 --> 01:23:46.255]  This means a major strategy shift, and the White House is trying to test to see if the public will bite on using the huge anti-terror mechanism that's been built against the original target it was intended for.
[01:23:46.295 --> 01:23:48.336]  I kept telling you, it's not about Iraq.
[01:23:48.356 --> 01:23:49.257]  It's not about Iran.
[01:23:49.297 --> 01:23:50.257]  That's small potatoes.
[01:23:50.578 --> 01:23:52.158]  The big prize is the U.S.
[01:23:52.238 --> 01:23:58.122]  You seize this, you've got an engine for war, an engine for a draft, an engine for people to suck off of and loot.
[01:23:59.324 --> 01:24:01.685]  And these are just hardcore crooks that run the New World Order.
[01:24:01.705 --> 01:24:03.886]  These are cold-blooded privateers.
[01:24:03.926 --> 01:24:05.246]  These are cold-blooded pirates.
[01:24:05.926 --> 01:24:09.227]  They're symbols of the Jolly Roger.
[01:24:10.188 --> 01:24:14.069]  And they are coming against us in a big way.
[01:24:14.129 --> 01:24:19.511]  They are setting up federal committees to go after people's speech and have terror speech.
[01:24:20.431 --> 01:24:24.092]  They claim it influences someone or discredits the government, that it's Al-Qaeda.
[01:24:25.113 --> 01:24:27.313]  And this memo's been out for a while.
[01:24:27.394 --> 01:24:27.854]  Remember the
[01:24:30.929 --> 01:24:34.126]  Deputy Attorney General in California, under Lockerbie,
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:35.700]  Bill Lockerbie.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.746]  Now that's back when they were telling us torture was good on the news, and that banning speech was good, when the public was still fooled by them.
[01:25:12.786 --> 01:25:15.148]  You know, back when they still had 75% approval ratings.
[01:25:15.188 --> 01:25:15.869]  Now it's the opposite.
[01:25:15.889 --> 01:25:16.710]  They've got 11%.
[01:25:17.370 --> 01:25:19.032]  And so they want to push this.
[01:25:19.092 --> 01:25:21.574]  They want to say, no more First Amendment.
[01:25:21.594 --> 01:25:23.896]  They want to say, we're going to put you in prison.
[01:25:23.916 --> 01:25:29.420]  And they also are putting all this out now, saying we're terrorists, to scare us into shutting up.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:30.201]  A chilling effect.
[01:25:31.391 --> 01:25:32.652]  Imagine being me, folks.
[01:25:32.712 --> 01:25:33.632]  You're scared to speak out.
[01:25:33.652 --> 01:25:35.273]  Can you imagine being Alex Jones?
[01:25:37.134 --> 01:25:39.015]  The enemy's fully aware of what I do.
[01:25:39.516 --> 01:25:46.880]  You say my name to Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity, they look like they've just been, you know, seen a 500-pound goblin.
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.281]  I mean, they literally have fear in them, and I don't like that.
[01:25:50.662 --> 01:25:52.523]  Powerful, evil people are afraid of me.
[01:25:53.063 --> 01:25:54.224]  Believe me, I don't like it.
[01:25:54.824 --> 01:25:58.586]  But it's like when somebody starts attacking you, you learn this getting in fistfights growing up.
[01:25:59.924 --> 01:26:00.225]  I don't know.
[01:26:17.429 --> 01:26:18.010]  I don't think so.
[01:26:36.679 --> 01:26:45.363]  Red coat, co-agitators, whatever you want to call them, running around on television, British aristocracy.
[01:26:45.403 --> 01:26:49.245]  I mean, Churchill was like fifth in line to be the King of England, folks.
[01:26:49.785 --> 01:26:50.426]  He's royalty.
[01:26:50.466 --> 01:26:52.306]  I'm not bashing Churchill himself.
[01:26:52.346 --> 01:27:03.992]  My point is to have true minions to the crown, true aid to camp to the real enemies of this society.
[01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:11.044]  The parasites that have been nesting for hundreds of years on top of the great British people and the great people of Ireland and Scotland.
[01:27:11.804 --> 01:27:14.645]  And now just, I mean, this is who we had wars with.
[01:27:15.085 --> 01:27:21.968]  They've even given us their red coat affectation towards hating the French and Freedom Fries and Freedom Toast.
[01:27:22.028 --> 01:27:27.770]  I was in a restaurant a few months ago and I went down to the beach and it was called Freedom Toast for the French Toast.
[01:27:27.810 --> 01:27:29.471]  I mean, just mindlessness.
[01:27:30.371 --> 01:27:32.392]  Just mindless, complete idiocy.
[01:27:37.023 --> 01:28:05.497]  I want you to go to PrisonPlanet.com right now, and I want you to get the story, Complaints Flood CNN After Beck Smears Ron Paul Supporters As Terrorists, Neocon And Ex-Marxist Demonize Founding Fathers Ron Paul Supporters As Terrorists, An Outrageous Attack On Free Speech, Urge Use Of Military Against Domestic Enemies, Anti-War Left, Libertarians, Talking Points Have Roots In September 2006 White House Strategy Document, Demands For Retraction Flood CNN Sponsors For Boycott.
[01:28:07.438 --> 01:28:11.379]  And, uh, look, Beck's already committing political suicide.
[01:28:12.099 --> 01:28:14.660]  Ron Paul is popular across the base.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:20.141]  Ron Paul is popular when he is in every poll where people are able to hear him speak.
[01:28:20.181 --> 01:28:21.761]  He's won every poll but one on Fox.
[01:28:22.141 --> 01:28:23.202]  He got second place there.
[01:28:24.642 --> 01:28:28.363]  And they are scared to death of Ron Paul.
[01:28:29.243 --> 01:28:31.724]  And people stop saying he can't win or the game's rigged.
[01:28:31.784 --> 01:28:32.584]  Hey, we're gonna fight.
[01:28:34.042 --> 01:28:38.724]  We're gonna fight this thing, and we're just gonna turn it over to God and ask for problems.
[01:28:38.744 --> 01:28:39.604]  Okay?
[01:28:40.104 --> 01:28:41.585]  That's it.
[01:28:43.065 --> 01:28:44.006]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.026 --> 01:28:46.066]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.987 --> 01:28:49.688]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:52.771 --> 01:29:00.238]  Hi, I'm Lynette Brooks, founder of MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse combining the healing power of flaxseed with the detoxification of bentonite clay.
[01:29:00.558 --> 01:29:06.583]  In a perfect world, we would eat natural healthy foods, but the foods we eat today are not the foods nature intended for us.
[01:29:07.023 --> 01:29:08.645]  Fast food is toxic food.
[01:29:09.065 --> 01:29:12.706]  I've been producing MediCleans for over 20 years, and customers from across the U.S.
[01:29:12.726 --> 01:29:21.069]  say that MediCleans helps your body detoxify from fast foods as well as other environmental poisons, such as heavy metals and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.950]  For centuries, flax has been known as nature's superfood.
[01:29:24.430 --> 01:29:31.432]  Even the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:29:31.952 --> 01:29:35.936]  A one month supply of MediCleanse is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:29:36.056 --> 01:29:41.902]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com for only $22.95 plus shipping and handling.
[01:29:42.062 --> 01:29:42.963]  Or call me today at 1-800-317-9547.
[01:29:43.043 --> 01:29:43.243]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:29:43.303 --> 01:29:45.024]  Radiant Health has never been easier!
[01:29:52.532 --> 01:29:57.477]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[01:29:57.797 --> 01:29:59.659]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[01:29:59.859 --> 01:30:02.902]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[01:30:03.102 --> 01:30:06.225]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[01:30:06.545 --> 01:30:08.387]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[01:30:08.647 --> 01:30:12.352]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[01:30:12.633 --> 01:30:15.296]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible!
[01:30:15.917 --> 01:30:20.223]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[01:30:20.423 --> 01:30:24.669]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
[01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:29.433]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[01:30:29.753 --> 01:30:33.996]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[01:30:34.336 --> 01:30:40.201]  You will receive information regarding America in prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[01:30:40.521 --> 01:30:42.963]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[01:30:43.143 --> 01:30:43.644]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[01:30:43.664 --> 01:30:44.765]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[01:30:52.589 --> 01:30:56.050]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:58.391]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:30:58.531 --> 01:31:00.991]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:31:01.252 --> 01:31:05.613]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[01:31:05.653 --> 01:31:06.333]  Here's why.
[01:31:06.733 --> 01:31:12.675]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:31:12.895 --> 01:31:18.917]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[01:31:19.137 --> 01:31:20.057]  But they're not cheating.
[01:31:20.297 --> 01:31:24.302]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:31:24.503 --> 01:31:28.848]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:31:28.928 --> 01:31:36.458]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:31:36.478 --> 01:31:37.039]  Get control.
[01:31:37.299 --> 01:31:37.859]  Get relief.
[01:31:37.939 --> 01:31:38.620]  Get some sleep.
[01:31:38.740 --> 01:31:41.941]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[01:31:42.061 --> 01:31:45.442]  That's www.OutIn90.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:31:45.462 --> 01:31:45.642]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:32:04.657 --> 01:32:09.242]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[01:32:10.684 --> 01:32:13.087]  I won't even turn my head.
[01:32:15.570 --> 01:32:21.556]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[01:32:21.616 --> 01:32:23.378]  I'll be gone like I said.
[01:32:26.005 --> 01:32:30.928]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[01:32:30.968 --> 01:32:35.291]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[01:32:35.652 --> 01:32:40.275]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin' cousin moan.
[01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:41.455]  Understand.
[01:32:41.936 --> 01:32:44.458]  Understand, you old man.
[01:32:44.538 --> 01:32:46.379]  I'm tired of your bad mouthing.
[01:32:47.199 --> 01:32:49.581]  Understand, you old man.
[01:32:50.842 --> 01:32:52.263]  Ha ha ha!
[01:32:52.283 --> 01:32:53.844]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:57.584 --> 01:32:59.586]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[01:32:59.606 --> 01:33:00.607]  until 2 p.m.
[01:33:01.487 --> 01:33:02.808]  Central Standard Time.
[01:33:02.948 --> 01:33:06.271]  We're live back from 9 to midnight right here on the Genesis Network.
[01:33:06.711 --> 01:33:08.593]  We streamed on the internet right when the show ends.
[01:33:08.613 --> 01:33:09.954]  You missed me in the first and second hour.
[01:33:10.434 --> 01:33:16.119]  We stream consecutively until the next show comes up the next day or on the weekend until I'm back live from 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:16.159 --> 01:33:19.261]  Central with the syndicated show we've now been doing for about 8-9 months.
[01:33:19.701 --> 01:33:21.463]  How time flies.
[01:33:25.433 --> 01:33:31.195]  Okay, uh, we're going to take some calls from John and Kevin and John and John and John and everybody else.
[01:33:32.136 --> 01:33:33.776]  Uh, John, John, and still more Johns.
[01:33:33.876 --> 01:33:41.920]  But, uh, before I do that, uh, look, I don't know what I have to say or do or... This is an information war.
[01:33:43.678 --> 01:33:45.278]  And we're in a fight of our lives.
[01:33:46.219 --> 01:33:55.061]  And weapons in this fight are things like Loose Change Final Cut, an all-new film, the preeminent 9-11 film, incredible interviews, new revelations, eyewitnesses.
[01:33:56.221 --> 01:33:59.442]  It's $19.95 for the DVD on InfoWars.com.

[01:34:26.804 --> 01:34:29.845]  Dozens and dozens and dozens of other films I've been authorized to post.
[01:34:30.325 --> 01:34:37.528]  There is so much on PrisonPlanet.tv, more than three and a half years now, up and running at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:37.548 --> 01:34:39.609]  I do want to thank all the members there for all they do.
[01:34:40.089 --> 01:34:52.854]  By the way, coming up on the 28th of November, we're talking about a week and a half from now, we're going to post in-game 1.5 of all the extra interviews and clips and behind-the-scenes things.
[01:34:52.915 --> 01:34:53.955]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:34:56.400 --> 01:34:58.642]  For PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[01:34:58.702 --> 01:35:03.406]  So know that Endgame 1.5 is really a film in and of itself.
[01:35:04.286 --> 01:35:06.908]  We'll have articles about it in the next week or so to tell you more about it.
[01:35:06.968 --> 01:35:08.930]  For PrisonPlanet.tv members.

[01:35:41.602 --> 01:35:45.504]  And a factory, a fulcrum, an armory of resistance.
[01:35:45.964 --> 01:35:47.145]  I want you to go get in game.
[01:35:47.165 --> 01:35:48.806]  I want you to burn at the disc and give it to people.

[01:36:21.251 --> 01:36:24.073]  You can get your tickets by calling 972-980-8877.
[01:36:35.069 --> 01:36:37.690]  And that is the Freedom Law School, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:44.994]  Freedom Law School's 2007 Texas Justice, Peace, and Freedom Conference, Friday, November 16th, 9 a.m.
[01:36:45.014 --> 01:36:45.314]  to 5 p.m.
[01:36:45.334 --> 01:36:51.637]  There will be a class on the Constitution presented by Freedom Law School's Dream Team members.
[01:36:52.344 --> 01:36:53.145]  We're good to go.
[01:37:17.663 --> 01:37:18.584]  We're good to go!
[01:37:46.796 --> 01:37:47.477]  We're good to go!
[01:38:06.299 --> 01:38:06.780]  We're good to go!
[01:38:28.278 --> 01:38:29.098]  We're good to go.
[01:38:52.916 --> 01:39:22.166]  Okay, I know I keep talking about this, because is it a big deal to you, I hope these calls I'm about to go to are calling in about this, is it a big deal to you that top neocons from Fox to CNN to Michael Savage to Neil Borch to all of them have the talking point, and it's an admitted White House talking point, to say if you disagree with the government, you're a terrorist, you're aiding terrorists, and if you're against the war, you're a terrorist, and they say, oh, it's horrible, the American people don't trust the government anymore.
[01:39:22.845 --> 01:39:24.566]  And they're terror groups that are domestic.
[01:39:24.846 --> 01:39:26.847]  These libertarians may stage attacks!
[01:39:27.987 --> 01:39:31.809]  They actually are saying that and inbound-bounding the Founding Fathers.
[01:39:32.830 --> 01:39:34.210]  And these guys are so arrogant!
[01:39:35.191 --> 01:39:42.794]  And they run around writing memos about how they want terror attacks to happen and how great they are and how they're going to get us once the attacks happen because we're going to make it happen.
[01:39:43.254 --> 01:39:44.535]  I mean, these people are evil!
[01:39:46.531 --> 01:39:54.534]  And now, in the blink of an eye, suddenly, we have the White House memos, and the White House talking points, and the State Department statements, and the new laws they're trying to pass, and the new commissions.
[01:39:54.994 --> 01:39:59.656]  They're saying, hey, the enemy terrorists are the American people.
[01:39:59.996 --> 01:40:02.157]  The American people are the terrorists.
[01:40:02.197 --> 01:40:05.198]  The American people are the enemy of the government.
[01:40:05.238 --> 01:40:08.739]  And then we play that FEMA piece when we're on the news saying, yeah, we've recruited
[01:40:09.922 --> 01:40:17.545]  The 26,000 preachers to tattle on people and tell them to submit to gun confiscation and go to FEMA camps and let them split up your families.
[01:40:17.565 --> 01:40:18.626]  We got the FEMA documents.
[01:40:18.646 --> 01:40:20.667]  We told you that a year before it came out in the news.
[01:40:22.007 --> 01:40:24.568]  And they're saying, well, the government's needs versus the people.
[01:40:24.628 --> 01:40:25.949]  See, they've separated it now.
[01:40:25.989 --> 01:40:28.150]  We're government and the corporations that own it are God.
[01:40:32.091 --> 01:40:33.372]  I mean, this is off the charts.
[01:40:34.477 --> 01:40:35.077]  Think about it.
[01:40:35.137 --> 01:40:37.578]  They are now making what we always told you.
[01:40:37.678 --> 01:40:55.366]  Because all the private training of police and military and the groups and the ADL training everybody and the FBI training manuals and the SWAT training and all the rest of it, and the videos cops have sent us of big classrooms where they're teaching them the founding fathers are terrorists, that the American people are evil terrorists, and we've got to take all their freedoms.
[01:40:55.826 --> 01:40:56.867]  We have it on video!
[01:40:57.447 --> 01:41:00.771]  And then pulling a woman over, she's got a pocket constitution, so let's arrest her.
[01:41:01.051 --> 01:41:02.933]  This pocket constitution may be illegal.
[01:41:03.253 --> 01:41:07.277]  One state trooper walks over with Abby Newman and asks the other state trooper, is she allowed to have this?
[01:41:07.317 --> 01:41:07.998]  Is this illegal?
[01:41:08.378 --> 01:41:11.741]  And he goes, that may be contraband, or maybe she's allowed to have that.
[01:41:12.442 --> 01:41:14.544]  You can't make it up.
[01:41:14.684 --> 01:41:18.188]  State police that have sworn an oath to it, and they think it's illegal.
[01:41:19.289 --> 01:41:21.251]  Well, they'd been through training where they were told it was illegal.
[01:41:22.586 --> 01:41:24.567]  I mean, they're taking low-grade morons, folks.
[01:41:24.607 --> 01:41:25.867]  I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[01:41:26.287 --> 01:41:37.211]  There are a lot of smart cops, a lot of smart military, but when I was in New York the last three times, I see the troops they've got deployed on the streets with M-16s, and folks, I walk up and talk to them, and it's sad.
[01:41:37.311 --> 01:41:39.852]  One time I had a camera going, but it's so embarrassing I won't put it on the web.
[01:41:40.632 --> 01:41:44.613]  And the guy literally was Down Syndrome.
[01:41:45.193 --> 01:41:46.394]  And you think I'm joking.
[01:41:46.414 --> 01:41:48.974]  You know, there's mild chromosome anomalies.
[01:41:49.015 --> 01:41:50.335]  He had one of those disorders.
[01:41:51.672 --> 01:42:02.400]  He literally had the eyes, the face, the nose, the tongue, the teeth, all the things with the extra chromosomes, and there's a bunch of other abnormalities, but he was one of those chromosomal disorders.
[01:42:03.261 --> 01:42:10.286]  And he was like... And I was just going, oh my God.
[01:42:13.601 --> 01:42:15.283]  And these state police are almost like that.
[01:42:15.303 --> 01:42:18.787]  They're like, you ain't allowed to have these, you see?
[01:42:19.508 --> 01:42:20.329]  I don't know.
[01:42:20.389 --> 01:42:22.411]  Let's go ahead and arrest her for it.
[01:42:22.431 --> 01:42:24.253]  If it's on, it's their squad car video.
[01:42:24.273 --> 01:42:32.323]  Remember Kelly Rushing handed out a Ron Paul Neocon speech called Neocon where he laid out how they're a bunch of Trotskyites in 2003?
[01:42:34.128 --> 01:42:39.211]  I get faxed to local newspapers saying, like it was normal, that Kelly Rushing was arrested.
[01:42:49.267 --> 01:42:49.928]  Oh, the Rushings.
[01:42:50.068 --> 01:42:52.730]  Oh, yes, here in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[01:42:52.830 --> 01:42:55.011]  Yeah, I heard about him getting arrested.
[01:42:55.051 --> 01:42:55.872]  It's very bizarre.
[01:42:56.332 --> 01:42:59.655]  He gave a state police officer a Ron Paul video and wrote a tyranny.
[01:42:59.675 --> 01:43:00.956]  And I talked to the judge.
[01:43:01.416 --> 01:43:05.099]  They charged him for the Ron Paul C-SPAN video and my video.
[01:43:05.119 --> 01:43:06.920]  They charged him with threats against the government.
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:09.342]  They said, you're not allowed to distribute anti-police propaganda.
[01:43:10.672 --> 01:43:14.814]  And that was Road to Tyranny, showing the cops arrest people for prior constitutions.
[01:43:15.774 --> 01:43:21.216]  And I called the judges home and people went to court and they threw the book at him and the jury found him not guilty.
[01:43:21.976 --> 01:43:26.638]  But they were about to put him in jail for two counts of terroristic threats, saying the videos were threats to law enforcement.
[01:43:27.178 --> 01:43:27.739]  Ron Paul.
[01:43:28.479 --> 01:43:30.440]  Folks, let me tell you something.
[01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.820]  They've done a job on people.
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:33.701]  Remember the guy in
[01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:35.500]  What was it?
[01:43:35.540 --> 01:43:36.060]  Tennessee?
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.941]  Owned the big lumber mill?
[01:43:38.961 --> 01:43:39.541]  One of the richest?
[01:43:39.621 --> 01:43:42.342]  And my point is, these are prominent people they're arresting.
[01:43:42.942 --> 01:43:45.242]  Put a sign up saying our justice system's a joke?
[01:43:46.002 --> 01:43:48.063]  Has it been in the news that his wife was on drugs?
[01:43:48.103 --> 01:43:48.863]  His younger wife?
[01:43:49.483 --> 01:43:50.503]  And she'd gotten the kids?
[01:43:50.563 --> 01:43:53.624]  And so he put a sign up saying the justice system's a joke?
[01:43:53.764 --> 01:43:55.624]  He was outside the jurisdiction in the county?
[01:43:56.024 --> 01:44:03.026]  The judge sent the police to arrest him and the judge told the paper, you're not allowed to be disrespectful of the judiciary.
[01:44:03.556 --> 01:44:11.459]  Now the judge got kicked off the bench later, but the point is, they think it's illegal to criticize them.
[01:44:12.459 --> 01:44:16.361]  They think it's illegal to give out a Ron Paul video.
[01:44:16.761 --> 01:44:19.982]  They think it's illegal to have a pocket constitution.
[01:44:20.891 --> 01:44:25.355]  That's why we put pocket constitutions in every video order that comes through our websites.
[01:44:26.116 --> 01:44:30.259]  In every single cotton-picking order.
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:34.443]  Because it is not Al-Qaeda, the Constitution is not Al-Qaeda.
[01:44:34.783 --> 01:44:36.585]  But they know the public is so dumb now.
[01:44:36.725 --> 01:44:37.565]  Those that aren't awake.
[01:44:38.046 --> 01:44:38.666]  Two worlds.
[01:44:39.968 --> 01:44:40.968]  Those that are awake, those aren't.
[01:44:40.988 --> 01:44:42.670]  They know the public is so dumb down.
[01:44:43.590 --> 01:44:48.213]  But we don't have just FBI training manuals saying the Constitution and those that talk about it are terrorists.
[01:44:48.734 --> 01:44:50.575]  Those that make frequent references to it are terrorists.
[01:44:50.595 --> 01:44:51.136]  That's a quote.
[01:44:52.497 --> 01:44:57.280]  We have the video of them being trained by FEMA, and we have it being carried out on the street.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:00.502]  We have the entire chain.
[01:45:02.044 --> 01:45:10.790]  The NAP reported in one area of Michigan, they went into elementary students, told them get on buses, they threw smoke bombs on, took them off, threw fake blood on them, and said we are the homeschooled
[01:45:12.708 --> 01:45:16.470]  Group against public education, and they screamed, we're now going to kill you.
[01:45:17.130 --> 01:45:18.031]  That was in the AP.
[01:45:19.732 --> 01:45:23.393]  See, the Fed and then the school said, we're sorry, parents are mad.
[01:45:24.594 --> 01:45:29.036]  We were funded by the fans to do that.
[01:45:29.196 --> 01:45:30.797]  See how diabolical?
[01:45:31.918 --> 01:45:35.219]  See, the globalists have a chance of succeeding because they're so over the top, folks.
[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:35.820]  They're so
[01:45:36.954 --> 01:45:49.425]  The arrogance, the chutzpah, the aplomb, the bravado, the macho-ness of this is just... Train cops the Constitution's illegal?
[01:45:50.266 --> 01:45:52.227]  Train them Ron Paul's illegal?
[01:45:53.308 --> 01:45:56.371]  Train them that signs in your yards are illegal?
[01:46:00.355 --> 01:46:01.275]  We're one inch.
[01:46:01.496 --> 01:46:04.158]  We're two seconds from midnight.
[01:46:05.825 --> 01:46:08.487]  And now they announce that if you disagree with the President, you're a terrorist.
[01:46:09.507 --> 01:46:12.109]  Alright, let's go to John in Missouri.
[01:46:12.129 --> 01:46:13.069]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:46:14.490 --> 01:46:15.111]  Yeah, Alex?
[01:46:15.391 --> 01:46:15.671]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:16.251 --> 01:46:26.317]  Yes, I have a couple questions for you, but I heard this morning that yesterday the head of the Republican Party called Ron Paul in to have a talk with him.
[01:46:26.357 --> 01:46:26.998]  Did you hear that?
[01:46:28.894 --> 01:46:33.916]  No, I didn't, but I know about a month and a half ago he got invited to the elite Republican dinner in D.C.
[01:46:34.076 --> 01:46:35.877]  and only four Republican candidates did.
[01:46:35.897 --> 01:46:37.757]  Uh-huh.
[01:46:37.877 --> 01:46:43.399]  Okay, and then what do you think about this Liberty Dollar being raided?
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.880]  Well, we put a story out on that yesterday.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:47.761]  It just shows how criminal the government's gotten.
[01:46:48.713 --> 01:46:51.054]  Oh yeah, and I just want to make a comment.
[01:46:51.474 --> 01:46:53.074]  I'm the one that called a few weeks ago.
[01:46:53.194 --> 01:46:54.695]  I don't think we have time.
[01:46:54.715 --> 01:46:58.056]  I think we ought to go up there and arrest them for treason and take over.
[01:46:58.076 --> 01:47:05.718]  Well, they would use that as an excuse to say, see, look, we're violent and declare martial law and bring in their foreign troops that are 20% of our military now.
[01:47:06.258 --> 01:47:09.241]  Yeah, I understand, but I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:47:09.261 --> 01:47:13.524]  I mean, all we're doing is talking, and they're just doing... Well, you know what?
[01:47:13.564 --> 01:47:13.964]  You know what?
[01:47:14.004 --> 01:47:15.405]  Have you noticed they want violence?
[01:47:15.726 --> 01:47:21.630]  Have you noticed they're preparing people so they can stage an event or copycat or provocateur one of our people into that?
[01:47:21.991 --> 01:47:26.114]  Now, if they're wanting that in strategy, do you think that's a good idea to do what they want?
[01:47:26.841 --> 01:47:27.482]  No, no.
[01:47:42.538 --> 01:47:42.738]  Right.
[01:47:42.758 --> 01:47:43.399]  I understand.
[01:47:43.579 --> 01:47:43.959]  You're right.
[01:47:43.979 --> 01:47:46.061]  I appreciate your call, John.
[01:47:46.141 --> 01:47:46.741]  I gotta jump here.
[01:47:46.801 --> 01:47:48.222]  Joe in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[01:47:48.242 --> 01:47:48.463]  Go ahead.
[01:48:09.716 --> 01:48:10.176]  Hey Alex.
[01:48:10.476 --> 01:48:10.656]  Hi.
[01:48:10.676 --> 01:48:16.498]  Today I had a talk with our Vice Chancellor who subtly warned me not to say fire in a theater.
[01:48:17.078 --> 01:48:25.560]  Joe, you call in every few months and you have problems at your college in Wisconsin and it's always the... I mean, it's fine, but I mean... Well, no, this is... We're on the verge of martial laws.
[01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.360]  I mean, what did you say?
[01:48:26.480 --> 01:48:27.760]  They're trying to violate your free speech?
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:34.802]  The right of rejection of the person listening trumps my right of free speech because it may not be pleasant for them.
[01:48:35.987 --> 01:48:37.609]  Yeah, that's how they do it.
[01:48:37.649 --> 01:48:41.314]  They say, you have free speech, but not if it hurts someone's feelings.
[01:48:41.814 --> 01:48:48.924]  So I just wanted to know, as a journalist, what irrefutable morality do I have to inform people?
[01:48:49.024 --> 01:48:51.968]  Not call to action, not panic, not any of that.
[01:48:52.771 --> 01:48:56.974]  Not fire in a theater, but what jurisprudence and morality do I use as a journalist?
[01:49:14.108 --> 01:49:15.249]  These people are bullies.
[01:49:15.329 --> 01:49:19.213]  Everything they do is about manipulating and controlling and cowing us.
[01:49:19.673 --> 01:49:20.414]  Stop caring.
[01:49:20.454 --> 01:49:21.555]  Get arrogant like they are.
[01:49:21.575 --> 01:49:22.716]  And by arrogant, I don't mean that.
[01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:23.917]  I mean aggressive.
[01:49:24.678 --> 01:49:24.998]  Okay?
[01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:26.219]  Stop being cowed.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:27.140]  Okay?
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:28.001]  And then move on.
[01:49:28.021 --> 01:49:29.923]  You know, I know you're constantly fighting for years.
[01:49:29.963 --> 01:49:32.065]  You've called it the main thing of this university.
[01:49:32.105 --> 01:49:33.766]  Move on and wake somebody else up somewhere.
[01:49:33.966 --> 01:49:36.689]  Little communist Soviet brainwashing cesspit.
[01:49:37.538 --> 01:49:42.100]  Move on and stop trying to, you know, find angels in a pit of pigs.
[01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.161]  I mean, you know, I mean, I don't know what to say to you, sir.
[01:49:45.501 --> 01:49:46.721]  Pamphleteer the place!
[01:49:50.422 --> 01:49:51.823]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:51.843 --> 01:49:53.943]  A new world order.
[01:49:54.664 --> 01:49:59.225]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by another world government.
[01:49:59.265 --> 01:50:01.326]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:50:02.366 --> 01:50:04.527]  Both their objective being world domination.
[01:50:05.157 --> 01:50:07.598]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:08.339 --> 01:50:15.663]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:18.672 --> 01:50:23.673]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:24.133 --> 01:50:27.634]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:27.994 --> 01:50:30.535]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[01:50:30.575 --> 01:50:31.715]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:31.735 --> 01:50:32.455]  They're not after money.
[01:50:32.495 --> 01:50:33.576]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:33.776 --> 01:50:34.556]  They're after power.
[01:50:34.776 --> 01:50:35.776]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:50:44.278 --> 01:50:44.778]  Endgame.
[01:50:44.798 --> 01:50:46.979]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:50:47.440 --> 01:50:48.584]  You have been warned.
[01:50:49.244 --> 01:50:54.328]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:50:54.388 --> 01:51:01.713]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems, and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[01:51:01.853 --> 01:51:12.521]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[01:51:12.681 --> 01:51:17.224]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:51:17.244 --> 01:51:17.804]  I don't know.
[01:51:35.558 --> 01:51:35.878]  We're good.
[01:51:49.059 --> 01:51:51.180]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:54.621]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:51:54.861 --> 01:51:59.423]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:51:59.803 --> 01:52:02.424]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:52:02.884 --> 01:52:09.627]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:52:09.847 --> 01:52:10.067]  Yeah!
[01:52:10.087 --> 01:52:15.330]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:17.411]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:52:17.911 --> 01:52:21.232]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:52:21.753 --> 01:52:25.154]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:52:25.194 --> 01:52:32.178]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:52:32.538 --> 01:52:37.900]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:52:39.121 --> 01:52:40.641]  I'm on a lonesome highway, I'm east Omaha,
[01:53:16.342 --> 01:53:44.812]  You think about the woman The girl you knew the night before But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' But your thoughts will soon be wanderin' The way they always do When you're ridin' sixteen hours There's nothin' much to do And you don't feel much like ridin'
[01:53:45.888 --> 01:53:46.591]  Let's do it for the show
[01:54:18.806 --> 01:54:19.426]  Welcome back.
[01:54:19.466 --> 01:54:22.548]  Glad that you decided to join us in the battle for the republic.
[01:54:23.429 --> 01:54:26.971]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:54:26.991 --> 01:54:28.832]  Joe, you're a really nice guy from Wisconsin.
[01:54:28.872 --> 01:54:30.033]  I'm sorry if I was being rude to you.
[01:54:30.573 --> 01:54:38.117]  I just, for two, three years, I think it's four years, you call in with the same thing about them harassing you, being mean to you, violating your free speech.
[01:54:38.217 --> 01:54:38.938]  Sue the punks!
[01:54:40.856 --> 01:54:43.438]  They're trying to violate your free speech and stuff of the things.
[01:54:43.518 --> 01:54:44.839]  Hand out thousands of pamphlets.
[01:54:44.879 --> 01:54:45.539]  Let them arrest you.
[01:54:45.559 --> 01:54:46.360]  Then you've got a cause.
[01:54:46.380 --> 01:54:48.081]  I mean, I'm not going to give you advice.
[01:54:48.701 --> 01:54:50.623]  I just, we're talking about martial law here.
[01:54:50.683 --> 01:54:55.966]  I just want callers every once in a while to talk about the issues I'm bringing up.
[01:54:56.647 --> 01:54:57.768]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:54:58.628 --> 01:55:01.630]  They're trying to say anybody that disagrees with the government is a terrorist.
[01:55:02.511 --> 01:55:03.431]  They are the terrorists.
[01:55:04.412 --> 01:55:05.473]  By the very definition.
[01:55:06.353 --> 01:55:07.935]  John in Amsterdam, you're on the air.
[01:55:07.975 --> 01:55:08.315]  Go ahead.
[01:55:09.246 --> 01:55:09.906]  Yes, thank you.
[01:55:09.926 --> 01:55:11.327]  Do me a good show, Alex.
[01:55:11.907 --> 01:55:24.111]  I have one of the tools that I used for finding the New World Order Agenda for the last four years is using a Paltalk Voice chat room and the title of that room is 9-1-1 was an inside job for the New World Order Agenda.
[01:55:24.731 --> 01:55:25.012]  Yes, I think.
[01:55:39.548 --> 01:55:41.270]  Let's be clear, they haven't changed the law.
[01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:53.841]  They passed in the House where they want to start deciding what books are burned and literally what's restricted and what speech could make people not love their sweet government and how it's all terrorism and how 9-11 truth are terrorists.
[01:55:54.141 --> 01:55:55.863]  So they're doing that and they're saying it.
[01:55:55.883 --> 01:55:57.724]  They haven't been able to bring it forward yet.
[01:55:58.205 --> 01:55:59.446]  They're totally discredited.
[01:55:59.486 --> 01:56:00.487]  They're falling apart.
[01:56:00.527 --> 01:56:01.608]  They're cornered rats.
[01:56:02.248 --> 01:56:03.489]  That's what makes them so dangerous.
[01:56:03.509 --> 01:56:27.345]  But CENTCOM admits, the Pentagon admits, the government admits they've spent tens of billions, 1.8 billion on one buy package a few years ago, to pay for fake media and fake reporters, and they do have minions and operatives, whole office buildings filled with them across the world, engaging in propaganda ops, just like China, and so they're all over spamming and COINTELPRO-ing and lying, and that only means we're kicking their hind in.
[01:56:28.519 --> 01:56:32.542]  Did you know that even in the chat room, certain words you're not allowed to use anymore?
[01:56:32.702 --> 01:56:43.811]  It's kind of a blacklist of words... Yeah, thousands and thousands of libraries, colleges ban PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com, corporations ban it, that's been all over the news.
[01:56:44.091 --> 01:56:53.479]  Yeah, they have filtering software just like China, but it's being done on a system, different internet systems, Comcast is being sued over this by people.
[01:56:53.919 --> 01:56:55.440]  Yes, they are censoring everywhere.
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:56:56.481]  Right now it's being phased in.
[01:56:57.426 --> 01:56:58.047]  It's something else.
[01:56:58.087 --> 01:57:01.972]  I want to talk about this Big Brother scenario that is happening in America.
[01:57:02.012 --> 01:57:03.735]  It's also happening in the Netherlands, by the way.
[01:57:04.436 --> 01:57:11.125]  I have a wonderful statement for people who are skeptical about, you know, we are warning the people about this.
[01:57:12.026 --> 01:57:29.313]  You know, even if you see yourself as pro-Big Brother and pro-New World Order and everything is okay and wonderful is nice and the government is nice, you have to understand that if Big Brother is there... Stay there, I want you to finish your comment from Amsterdam in 70 seconds.
[01:57:31.594 --> 01:57:32.955]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:57:32.995 --> 01:57:35.736]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:57:46.101 --> 01:57:50.305]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:50.945 --> 01:57:51.766]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.527 --> 01:57:53.447]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.088 --> 01:57:57.991]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.272 --> 01:58:02.395]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:13.224]  We are now already into hour number three in this worldwide Friday Transmission.
[01:58:15.108 --> 01:58:16.149]  The 16th day of November, 2007.
[01:58:17.110 --> 01:58:25.537]  We've got, as he did last Friday, Steve Quayle joining us coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:25.557 --> 01:58:28.900]  We'll have open phones continually through the interview and a ton of news I haven't gotten to yet.
[01:58:30.221 --> 01:58:34.084]  John in Amsterdam was talking about, even if you love Big Brother, please continue.
[01:58:34.881 --> 01:58:46.066]  Yes, even if you are pro-Big Brother or pro-New World Order, you have to realize that in the future they can create illegal laws, as they do already, and they make you a criminal even that you're not knowing about it.
[01:58:46.106 --> 01:58:49.648]  So let's say that you're doing everything as well, have nothing to hide.
[01:58:50.128 --> 01:58:52.550]  You know this mantra that people use as an argument?
[01:58:52.970 --> 01:58:54.290]  It's a silly statement, by the way.
[01:58:54.731 --> 01:58:59.473]  But if people really think that they love Big Brother, it's okay, it's for our protection,
[01:59:00.737 --> 01:59:09.486]  I think it's for protecting the elite for the future, because if we are going to rebel and being angry about and upset, they want to have Big Brother to protect them.
[01:59:09.566 --> 01:59:10.607]  It's not to protect us.
[01:59:11.148 --> 01:59:17.955]  But yes, they can change the laws in the future and make criminals, so-called criminals, or criminalized criminals.
[01:59:17.975 --> 01:59:19.837]  Who controls the criminals in government?
[01:59:20.237 --> 01:59:21.138]  See, that's the whole point.
[01:59:23.157 --> 01:59:29.484]  So if people are realizing this, that we live in a high-tech society that can, you know, change around.
[01:59:29.545 --> 01:59:34.911]  And I think that Orwellian state fascist New World Order is going to happen in the States.
[01:59:35.451 --> 01:59:37.454]  And you have to be really stupid if you don't see it.
[01:59:38.575 --> 01:59:40.798]  Are people waking up in your country?
[01:59:41.957 --> 01:59:43.498]  Oh, for sure, yes.
[01:59:43.758 --> 01:59:49.221]  You know, more and more people in the Netherlands are totally fed up with the Big Brother scenario.
[01:59:49.321 --> 01:59:52.862]  Even the voting machines, court cases, we have won.
[01:59:52.882 --> 01:59:57.225]  You know, we have fought the battle against the voting machines and we won the battle.
[01:59:57.605 --> 01:59:59.646]  We have to change, they have to change everything.
[01:59:59.666 --> 02:00:02.007]  Now, the next elections will be only with pencil.
[02:00:03.126 --> 02:00:03.727]  God bless you.
[02:00:03.767 --> 02:00:05.229]  And see, that's what we're doing here, too.
[02:00:05.269 --> 02:00:06.451]  We're beginning to fight.
[02:00:06.851 --> 02:00:07.372]  They're mad.
[02:00:07.412 --> 02:00:07.953]  They're upset.
[02:00:07.993 --> 02:00:09.695]  They can be defeated.
[02:00:10.116 --> 02:00:11.057]  Just like Hitler.
[02:00:11.978 --> 02:00:13.360]  Just like Ceausescu.
[02:00:13.461 --> 02:00:14.562]  Just like Mussolini.
[02:00:14.943 --> 02:00:16.184]  Just like so many before them.
[02:00:16.204 --> 02:00:18.387]  Just like the British Empire was beaten in the U.S.
[02:00:18.768 --> 02:00:20.070]  We are going to beat them!
[02:00:22.150 --> 02:00:28.394]  By the way, Google Laptop Brigade and Ron Paul, door-to-door, and people showing video of Ron Paul.
[02:00:28.554 --> 02:00:33.757]  That is an excellent tip, because this is the power to show the people how they can have a change of heart.
[02:00:33.797 --> 02:00:37.840]  Because if you show something on a laptop, door-to-door, people are waking up.
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:39.681]  They are.
[02:00:39.721 --> 02:00:40.621]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:00:40.641 --> 02:00:41.302]  Good to hear from you.
[02:00:41.322 --> 02:00:43.443]  We'll take more calls when we get back with Steve Quayle.
[02:00:43.463 --> 02:00:48.206]  Last night I was on CFRB, Big Toronto Station, going across Eastern Canada.
[02:00:49.051 --> 02:00:59.755]  I've been on there two or three times before, and they took about ten calls while I was on, and I think seven of the ten said, oh, we like you, Alex, and we like the work you do, and we know about the New Old Order, but shouldn't we get rid of 80 percent?
[02:00:59.815 --> 02:01:00.855]  Don't we need to get rid?
[02:01:00.875 --> 02:01:02.295]  Don't we need to kill people?
[02:01:02.315 --> 02:01:05.877]  I mean, this is a mainstream view.
[02:01:05.937 --> 02:01:10.158]  People don't know why they've been inculcated kind of in the Moonraker scenario.
[02:01:11.252 --> 02:01:12.774]  Uh, but you've been inculcated.
[02:01:12.794 --> 02:01:13.835]  You have been brainwashed.
[02:01:13.855 --> 02:01:16.457]  You have been, uh, this has been put into your mind.
[02:01:16.497 --> 02:01:17.358]  I mean, who's gonna die?
[02:01:17.378 --> 02:01:25.525]  Are you gonna look at these African children, these Latin American children, the children here, uh, being implanted with the viruses, being poisoned, all the death, all the sterilization.
[02:01:25.545 --> 02:01:26.766]  Are you gonna, I mean, are you gonna go do it?
[02:01:27.627 --> 02:01:30.209]  You gonna go put a .45 in the little black kid's head and blow it off?
[02:01:30.690 --> 02:01:36.475]  I mean, if there's so many of us, I don't want you to commit suicide, but before you say kill somebody else, I suggest you go find
[02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:46.375]  I mean, before you go kill children or call for global extermination, if it's so bad, I suggest you find a tall building and make sure nobody's beneath you and throw yourself off.
[02:01:46.415 --> 02:01:50.097]  Now, I'm not, that's a figure of speech, I don't mean that, but that's, that's the comparison here.
[02:01:51.318 --> 02:01:57.422]  I mean, uh, you know, nobody's stopping you from that big ol' bottle of sleeping pills you got, uh, uh, in the cabinet there.
[02:01:57.482 --> 02:01:58.342]  Just, just stop it!
[02:01:59.223 --> 02:02:01.625]  Don't you understand, you fools, who think like that?
[02:02:01.965 --> 02:02:02.845]  This is for you!
[02:02:03.986 --> 02:02:05.047]  Don't you understand that?
[02:02:05.107 --> 02:02:06.748]  Can't you get that through your noggin?
[02:02:08.346 --> 02:02:09.407]  Caller after caller.
[02:02:09.447 --> 02:02:10.147]  Oh, I like you.
[02:02:10.447 --> 02:02:12.108]  I don't like the New World Order.
[02:02:12.208 --> 02:02:13.308]  I know this is all true.
[02:02:13.368 --> 02:02:14.048]  Oh, endgame.
[02:02:14.489 --> 02:02:17.850]  But, I mean, don't we need to... It's a horrible thing to say, but don't we need to kill 80%?
[02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:20.031]  I mean, isn't it hurting the Earth?
[02:02:20.051 --> 02:02:21.452]  Don't we need global taxes?
[02:02:21.512 --> 02:02:24.213]  I mean, don't we... I mean, you were brainwashed.
[02:02:24.233 --> 02:02:25.373]  You were brainwashed.
[02:02:26.394 --> 02:02:27.954]  I mean, think about what you're saying.
[02:02:28.014 --> 02:02:29.235]  That's what Hitler wanted.
[02:02:29.555 --> 02:02:34.197]  He wanted a global Germania, and so then he could go around killing the lesser races.
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:36.281]  Don't you understand?
[02:02:36.781 --> 02:02:38.583]  You're in the crosshairs, you fools!
[02:02:41.886 --> 02:02:43.307]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:43.327 --> 02:02:45.429]  A new world order.
[02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:50.373]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:02:51.034 --> 02:02:52.795]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:53.856 --> 02:02:56.098]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:02:56.639 --> 02:02:59.041]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:02:59.817 --> 02:03:07.177]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:10.154 --> 02:03:15.137]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:15.618 --> 02:03:19.120]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:19.480 --> 02:03:22.002]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:22.042 --> 02:03:23.203]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:23.223 --> 02:03:23.963]  They're not after money.
[02:03:23.983 --> 02:03:25.064]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:25.264 --> 02:03:26.045]  They're after power.
[02:03:26.265 --> 02:03:27.386]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:05:54.303 --> 02:05:58.265]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.485 --> 02:06:02.548]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:07.242]  All right, I want to jam a lot of colds into the shower with Steve Quayle.
[02:06:07.622 --> 02:06:10.864]  We have links to his sign-up on Infowars.com.
[02:06:11.384 --> 02:06:13.385]  SteveQuayle.com in a few files.
[02:06:13.405 --> 02:06:18.308]  I've interviewed about Steve many times over the years, and I've interviewed him many times over the years.
[02:06:18.328 --> 02:06:21.730]  I guess we've been talking to each other on air for about, off and on, for about 10 years.
[02:06:21.770 --> 02:06:23.951]  He's been on air about 15, 16 years.
[02:06:24.011 --> 02:06:24.752]  I've been on air about 13 years.
[02:06:25.979 --> 02:06:27.080]  Yeah, maybe he's been on longer.
[02:06:27.100 --> 02:06:32.923]  I used to hear Steve 10 years ago talking about global eugenics and extermination plans and all.
[02:06:34.283 --> 02:06:36.064]  I thought he meant well, but I didn't think it was that bad.
[02:06:36.444 --> 02:06:39.586]  And now, so much of the books he wrote, the things he talked about, really are true.
[02:06:39.626 --> 02:06:43.188]  It's another visionary who we enjoy having here on the show with us.
[02:06:43.528 --> 02:06:49.551]  Steve, I don't know if you heard me earlier, right at the end of the last segment, but last night I was on CFRB Big Station.
[02:06:50.412 --> 02:06:50.872]  I don't know.
[02:07:05.656 --> 02:07:29.593]  Oh, I agree with you about the New World Order, and I like you, and I've seen your videos, but we do need to kill 80% of people, and, you know, we do need to reduce the population, and the public, this is like, quote, common sense to people, and when Dr. Pianca gives a speech to the Texas Academy of Scientists and says we need 90% to be killed sooner rather than later, as fast as possible, he gets a standing ovation.
[02:07:29.894 --> 02:07:32.816]  The news is, not that he said it, the news is he got the standing ovation.
[02:07:32.836 --> 02:07:34.317]  I mean, can you just
[02:07:34.981 --> 02:07:44.345]  Talk about where these ideas came from, where they're pushing, why they love death, and then try to explain to the people that have bought into this elite mindset, they're not part of the elite.
[02:07:44.745 --> 02:07:51.108]  They're going to be killed or be diseased or be implanted with the cancer or the poisons themselves.
[02:07:51.588 --> 02:08:02.753]  And even if they were members of the elite, or those that would be spared in this ongoing project that's intensifying, they need to look into the eyes of these children and women and men that are dying, and need to humanize that.
[02:08:02.813 --> 02:08:04.294]  This is great wickedness, Steve.
[02:08:04.938 --> 02:08:09.181]  Well, Alex, first of all, you've nailed it in so many of your broadcasts.
[02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:12.404]  It's about population reduction, and I'm appalled.
[02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:17.768]  Now, what I would say is that, with due respect to the Canadian listeners, they have bought the lie.
[02:08:18.208 --> 02:08:25.834]  When you disassociate the uniqueness of man's creation from the Creator God, when you take the literal
[02:08:26.374 --> 02:08:27.996]  We're good to go.
[02:08:41.909 --> 02:08:47.232]  Between he who died to redeem mankind and those who seek to destroy mankind.
[02:08:47.512 --> 02:08:48.333]  You know, it's fascinating.
[02:08:48.433 --> 02:09:04.782]  When we deal with eugenics, when we deal with every form of genetic manipulation, what you've got is you ultimately get the starting point that they, the Luciferians, the Elitists, want to absolutely destroy all memory of the living God.
[02:09:04.802 --> 02:09:06.483]  They want to take, obviously, the Bible out.
[02:09:06.523 --> 02:09:08.984]  They want to recreate the
[02:09:09.444 --> 02:09:14.845]  The children that are being born in their new world globe speak and their new world idolatry.
[02:09:15.285 --> 02:09:27.088]  So when you dehumanize and, if you will, deculturize any of the roots of America's founding and those who honored us, that gave us a system, listen, they acknowledge God.
[02:09:27.308 --> 02:09:32.489]  All you have to read is Peter Marshall's book, The Light and the Glory, and most people, I think, Alex, have forgotten that.
[02:09:32.529 --> 02:09:35.070]  But going to the basics of your question,
[02:09:35.630 --> 02:09:49.936]  It's a war between God and the Devil, and the Luciferians openly worship Lucifer, openly sacrifice to Lucifer, and they're using all of their, what I coined a word a number of years ago, almost a decade ago, called technecadence, okay?
[02:09:50.436 --> 02:09:52.277]  And that's technological decadence.
[02:09:52.617 --> 02:09:55.218]  That technecadence to absolutely
[02:09:55.758 --> 02:09:59.121]  Go after and destroy the last messages of every human being.
[02:09:59.181 --> 02:10:06.026]  By the way, a top transhumanist that's in Endgame talks about, we are suicidal nihilists, we love death.
[02:10:06.747 --> 02:10:10.990]  It's the ultimate expression of power for us to destroy the whole planet.
[02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:13.392]  And he says we're lusting after just killing.
[02:10:13.412 --> 02:10:17.335]  And I guess it is the final phase of decadence.
[02:10:17.635 --> 02:10:20.818]  We saw it with Roman emperors and others.
[02:10:21.498 --> 02:10:36.389]  You know, it's a mental sickness, a spiritual sickness, but for listeners who are secular, listeners who are atheists that are listening, even if you don't believe in God, and Steve and I don't believe, we know, and even if you don't believe in good and evil, you know, you don't believe in the devil, but the devil believes in you.
[02:10:37.470 --> 02:10:41.833]  The thing I want to point out to people and get your take on here is that just take Dr.
[02:10:43.271 --> 02:11:08.090]  I was on his own website, UT Biology Department, and I was, he's one of the top biologists there, I was reading it, and he says, it's him dressed up as a druid, priest, and he talks about Lucifer, and he says, and I also, he has his buffalo bull named Lucifer, and it's all this weird occult stuff on there, and every time you look into a Peter Singer, every time you look into a Prince Philip, a Ted Turner,
[02:11:08.630 --> 02:11:25.049]  Every time a more strong every not not part of the time not 80% of the time not 90% They're always pushing agnostic atheism humanism, but when you actually look at them and the UN Chapel and the rest of it they are and I know I'm
[02:11:25.709 --> 02:11:26.870]  You're laying it out well, Alex.
[02:11:44.633 --> 02:11:46.875]  We can't separate, you know, atheists and agnostics.
[02:11:46.895 --> 02:11:50.898]  You know, the idea that we're a secular society is total bull manure.
[02:11:50.998 --> 02:11:51.638]  It's crap.
[02:11:51.678 --> 02:11:55.121]  The bottom line is men have a spiritual nature to them.
[02:11:55.141 --> 02:12:00.625]  They're either going to manifest that nature in acknowledging the God of Heaven, or they're going to worship Lucifer.
[02:12:00.686 --> 02:12:09.833]  Isn't it fascinating that even when you look at the opponents of Christianity, like the gentleman that you're talking about, who's a Druidic priest.
[02:12:09.853 --> 02:12:11.054]  Now let's talk about the Druids.
[02:12:11.074 --> 02:12:12.575]  They worship the God of forces.
[02:12:13.075 --> 02:12:32.297]  Right out of the book of Daniel, they obviously practice human sacrifice, so when someone's willing to slay a child, and Alex, if you and I or the listeners could even get a glimpse from the God's viewpoint of all the blood that's shed in their sacrifices, then they can understand that the people, even who don't believe in God, aren't
[02:12:34.417 --> 02:12:42.099]  By the way, we've seen all these weird Clinton and Bush cryptic speeches after a war, and Bush will get a creamy-eyed look and talk about dark forces of evil.
[02:12:42.139 --> 02:12:44.240]  That Pentagon speech is some road to tyranny.
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:50.241]  Dark forces of evil that feed on human suffering, and he literally begins to almost glow like a little green demon.
[02:12:50.561 --> 02:12:55.582]  And then, you know, he talks about the great sacrifice and starts licking his lips.
[02:12:56.113 --> 02:13:16.566]  Absolutely, and you know, let me just share this, multi-starred active-duty generals have talked at length and spoken at length about what goes on in the secret labyrinths below, you know, notable, very, very prominent architectural places around the world.
[02:13:16.646 --> 02:13:21.749]  Now, here's the thing, the blood sacrifice, the Bible, look, I'm not going to preach, but I'm just saying that the Bible keeps
[02:13:23.263 --> 02:13:24.785]  The life is in the blood, okay?
[02:13:39.369 --> 02:13:40.390]  Global religion.
[02:13:40.790 --> 02:13:42.911]  And see, we're being set up for the Antichrist.
[02:13:43.091 --> 02:13:47.713]  Obviously the Bible teaches that the Antichrist is going to make war on the saints.
[02:13:48.153 --> 02:13:53.536]  And when you see, you have just defined something that I think very few people can even realize.
[02:13:53.576 --> 02:13:57.038]  When they're talking about sacrifice, let me tell you what a top Luciferian
[02:13:57.338 --> 02:14:05.901]  He told me, big-time CIA devil worshipper, he says, when we talk about God, Steve, we talk about Lucifer.
[02:14:06.321 --> 02:14:17.766]  He said, when you see the politicians that he named them all off, and they're the ones everybody sees on their television, he says, when they talk about God, or the Lord, they're not talking about God and Jesus.
[02:14:17.806 --> 02:14:21.107]  Now, as a good example of that, remember Alex Bush when he did his first
[02:14:22.209 --> 02:14:23.270]  I don't know.
[02:14:42.746 --> 02:14:43.807]  I don't think so.
[02:14:58.115 --> 02:14:58.515]  Are you
[02:15:18.203 --> 02:15:20.924]  to Lucifer that brings him literally on the planet to rule.
[02:15:21.264 --> 02:15:46.336]  And they believe that with the absence of all Christians and any relationship to the God of the Bible, His mandate, His laws, or His precepts, that they will have basically a technological bliss in which they'll live forever, download their memories, they'll never die, they'll never have to face the judgment, and boy, from there on out, people should really start to realize that all transhumanists, all of them that are talking about spiritual machines,
[02:15:46.796 --> 02:15:59.442]  Listen, we've been experiencing through science fiction, we've been prepped through all the years of whether it was starting out, you know, when... Well, what does Revelation talk about that they bring into the temple is that it's a living machine that does wonders.
[02:15:59.922 --> 02:16:00.503]  Absolutely.
[02:16:00.603 --> 02:16:05.005]  Actually, it's a... and this is something that I think everyone should realize that
[02:16:05.625 --> 02:16:11.929]  On my website, and I know on your website too, but on my website I try and feature stories about robotics.
[02:16:12.009 --> 02:16:24.678]  Right now the big deal is, and you probably are aware of this, but they're now talking about creating robots that are so lifelike that what will be the legal standing of the robot, especially if she's female and you're male and you're having sex with it.
[02:16:24.838 --> 02:16:25.598]  I'm not kidding you.
[02:16:26.139 --> 02:16:27.760]  I'm not making this stuff up, folks.
[02:16:28.060 --> 02:16:34.484]  The bottom line is, is that now it's going to this, Alex, these people have the deaf
[02:16:34.884 --> 02:16:48.862]  Well even mainstream news is talking about how they're already cloning humans and cloning other primates and they're keeping it somewhat, but they say that now they're going to clone literal replicants for people and claim it's a machine because man made it, but really it's just a human.
[02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:55.023]  Well, right, and you know, this is something that I think that most people... By the way, will those clones, those aren't going to have souls, are they?
[02:16:55.043 --> 02:16:55.563]  Or what do you think?
[02:16:55.884 --> 02:16:58.305]  No, well, that's the question, you know.
[02:16:58.325 --> 02:16:59.986]  A soul, let me define a soul.
[02:17:00.066 --> 02:17:02.947]  The Bible teaches mind, will, intellect, and emotion.
[02:17:03.108 --> 02:17:08.270]  The soul is what the Spirit of God, when it's regenerated, in the body relates to.
[02:17:08.631 --> 02:17:11.892]  So they'll have a persona, but it will be a demonic persona.
[02:17:11.952 --> 02:17:13.693]  It will not be a human persona.
[02:17:13.833 --> 02:17:15.454]  It's like when people ask me about the giants.
[02:17:15.494 --> 02:17:16.575]  When the giants die,
[02:17:17.015 --> 02:17:23.237]  Those spirits of the giants, which were not human and not all angels, those are what became demons on the earth.
[02:17:23.717 --> 02:17:28.999]  Well, yeah, that's what it talks about in the incredible stuff in Genesis and Ezekiel.
[02:17:29.119 --> 02:17:29.899]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:29.919 --> 02:17:30.619]  This is wild stuff.
[02:17:30.639 --> 02:17:32.340]  We're talking about what the globalists believe, folks.
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:34.841]  Whether you believe it or not, they do believe this.
[02:17:41.627 --> 02:17:45.551]  Ted Andrews for Midas November 16, 2007 Gold 793.90 Hansco Coins can be purchased for $817.94, $403.15 per half, $201.58 per quarter.
[02:17:45.591 --> 02:17:46.171]  That's $817.94, $403.15 and $201.58.
[02:17:56.249 --> 02:17:58.951]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[02:17:58.991 --> 02:18:00.792]  The bond market continues to slump.
[02:18:00.972 --> 02:18:01.272]  J.P.
[02:18:01.312 --> 02:18:04.293]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[02:18:04.313 --> 02:18:06.535]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[02:18:06.595 --> 02:18:11.497]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[02:18:11.557 --> 02:18:13.979]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[02:18:14.099 --> 02:18:18.521]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[02:18:18.861 --> 02:18:19.282]  The U.S.
[02:18:19.322 --> 02:18:23.664]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[02:18:23.764 --> 02:18:25.565]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[02:18:25.985 --> 02:18:28.747]  Economist Rudy Boyd published the report, Bubble Leaking.
[02:18:29.007 --> 02:18:30.228]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[02:18:30.328 --> 02:18:35.951]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.

[02:18:42.756 --> 02:18:45.578]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:18:45.618 --> 02:18:52.322]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled, Unlimited Access?
[02:18:53.101 --> 02:19:00.063]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, B.I.
[02:19:00.523 --> 02:19:01.204]  Lennon, on them.
[02:19:02.044 --> 02:19:06.725]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[02:19:07.346 --> 02:19:11.267]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.

[02:19:41.576 --> 02:19:43.277]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[02:19:43.537 --> 02:19:45.218]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[02:19:45.418 --> 02:19:49.439]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[02:19:49.639 --> 02:19:52.681]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[02:19:52.861 --> 02:19:56.702]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[02:19:56.843 --> 02:19:59.244]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[02:19:59.344 --> 02:20:02.585]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[02:20:02.585 --> 02:20:02.985]  I think so.
[02:20:18.456 --> 02:20:18.796]  I think so.
[02:20:41.576 --> 02:20:43.058]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.
[02:20:43.399 --> 02:20:48.907]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[02:20:49.387 --> 02:20:57.319]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[02:20:57.739 --> 02:20:58.039]  I think so.
[02:21:21.369 --> 02:21:26.012]  That's 1-800-275-1126 or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[02:21:26.132 --> 02:21:30.034]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[02:21:30.074 --> 02:21:31.895]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[02:21:47.096 --> 02:21:54.241]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[02:21:56.543 --> 02:22:01.926]  This is the end, my only friend.
[02:22:02.247 --> 02:22:07.871]  The end of our elaborate love.
[02:22:07.971 --> 02:22:10.452]  Monday through Friday, we're here live, 11 a.m.
[02:22:10.573 --> 02:22:11.073]  until 2 p.m.
[02:22:11.113 --> 02:22:13.014]  Back Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:22:13.054 --> 02:22:16.777]  Central, syndicated as well, not just on AM and FM or satellite or internet.
[02:22:17.643 --> 02:22:24.347]  At TruthNews.us and InfoWars.com, but also on the Global Shortwave, WWCR.
[02:22:24.367 --> 02:22:26.448]  We also re-air on WWCR 9 to Midnight.
[02:22:26.889 --> 02:22:32.992]  And Steve Quayle's show is on from 6 to 8, and also on Global Shortwave, the Internet, and AM and FM stations out there.
[02:22:33.973 --> 02:22:44.459]  Steve, I want to come back and take calls in the next longer segment and talk more about them saying the American people are terrorists and they're against the war, 9-11 Truth, and your take on them shifting gears into this.
[02:22:46.576 --> 02:22:50.221]  I mean, I remember reading the United Nations Biological Diversity Assessment.
[02:22:50.241 --> 02:22:52.684]  It's actually in Road to Tyranny.
[02:22:53.424 --> 02:22:56.188]  This is an official UN government-sponsored document.
[02:22:57.100 --> 02:23:03.224]  And they say in there, oh, we need to bring back human sacrifice and wars to reduce population.
[02:23:03.244 --> 02:23:04.805]  This is what Mother Earth needs.
[02:23:05.265 --> 02:23:11.169]  They don't even hide their religion, but then we're not supposed to talk about the fact that they're religious.
[02:23:11.789 --> 02:23:22.676]  Like, they tell us religion doesn't exist, and that our beliefs don't exist, and that we're bad, but then they're so upset about us and no other group, but then they're totally, totally religious.
[02:23:25.526 --> 02:23:30.150]  Well, absolutely, and it's kind of like Dylan's song, you gotta serve somebody, okay?
[02:23:30.610 --> 02:23:34.694]  And see, the deal is, Alex, is that this is what I think people have got to understand.
[02:23:34.754 --> 02:23:35.134]  The war.
[02:23:35.174 --> 02:23:37.376]  Now, I want to talk about what Glenn Beck did.
[02:23:37.797 --> 02:23:39.999]  What he did is a form of terrorism.
[02:23:40.259 --> 02:23:41.520]  And let me say this, dude.
[02:23:41.620 --> 02:23:43.842]  Intentionally put fear into a group of people.
[02:23:44.322 --> 02:23:47.065]  He's calling everybody that's talking about the Constitution.
[02:23:47.105 --> 02:23:47.745]  This is amazing!
[02:23:48.126 --> 02:23:50.488]  He goes on and talks about the Constitution.
[02:23:50.928 --> 02:23:55.731]  And then he absolutely does probably one of the most provocative things that's ever been done.
[02:23:55.811 --> 02:24:00.293]  Look, if this would have been done by somebody on the left, we would have been screaming, and we're screaming now.
[02:24:00.573 --> 02:24:03.835]  But for what he has done, he is vilifying people.
[02:24:04.375 --> 02:24:08.978]  So that means now it's okay to basically dismiss, quote, the Ron Paul supporters.
[02:24:09.038 --> 02:24:11.679]  I don't think it's going to go this way, but this is what he's saying.
[02:24:12.039 --> 02:24:13.500]  And then ultimately destroy them.
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:17.402]  And if people argue with my little formula, identify, vilify, nullify, destroy,
[02:24:17.802 --> 02:24:22.707]  He did say, Alex, as you are aware, it's on your website, that the bottom line is the U.S.
[02:24:22.747 --> 02:24:26.091]  military may be called out to have to do something about these people.
[02:24:26.491 --> 02:24:35.181]  That infuriates me, that he's calling for the death of people that are standing up for the Constitution, that believe in this country, and how dare he?
[02:24:35.621 --> 02:24:37.762]  He is an... and then Horowitz?
[02:24:37.842 --> 02:24:38.543]  Come on!
[02:24:38.903 --> 02:24:43.685]  That guy's like, you know, coming from a Marxist background.
[02:24:44.005 --> 02:24:45.106]  He should know better.
[02:24:45.246 --> 02:24:46.126]  Shame on him!
[02:24:46.526 --> 02:24:49.888]  And I think, Alex, the thing is, is that these people are religious.
[02:24:50.648 --> 02:24:52.129]  They're very much spiritual.
[02:24:52.569 --> 02:24:56.111]  They believe that Gaia is Mother Earth and that she is a goddess.
[02:24:56.658 --> 02:25:02.020]  The Goddess Gaia must be appeased, and the only way you appease the Goddess is with human sacrifice.
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:03.941]  Well, I noticed this, and then I looked into it.
[02:25:03.981 --> 02:25:05.761]  I kept noticing in England or D.C.
[02:25:05.801 --> 02:25:18.186]  or Austin, everywhere they have war memorials, they put a big Goddess up on a capitol or on a pedestal looking down, and then I went and hooked it up, and sure enough, that's a sacrifice to the Goddess, putting the war-dead monument in front of her.
[02:25:18.706 --> 02:25:23.008]  Absolutely, and Goddess worship is coming back big time, and ladies and gentlemen,
[02:25:23.464 --> 02:25:30.591]  You're seeing now, those, and look Alex, just take it, like you said earlier, you can take it out of the religious realm, but these people are death set.
[02:25:30.631 --> 02:25:40.922]  They have their ceremonies, they have their books they read, you know, the book of the dead, God in his infinite mercy gives us the book of life, they, and seriously, I'm not kidding you, they get the book of death.
[02:25:41.563 --> 02:25:44.586]  The point that I think that people have got to understand, this is a war!
[02:25:45.106 --> 02:25:58.569]  And if everybody, I know that you linked to it on your website, I was just on your website, the CNN, everyone should send CNN their comments on how incredibly, I don't even know the word, terrorizing
[02:25:59.494 --> 02:26:17.854]  Well, they're openly following White House memos, they're all doing it now in unison, saying they want to turn the huge apparatus they built to fight foreign terrorists against the American people, and they even start talking bad about, oh, Americans have this history of rebelling, oh, the Founding Fathers, it's bad!
[02:26:18.634 --> 02:26:25.919]  And he's actually got a Brit on there talking about how they actually badmouth the Founding Fathers and mix them in with Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:25.959 --> 02:26:27.100]  I mean, this is crazy!
[02:26:27.360 --> 02:26:30.542]  I mean, how arrogant are they, Steve, to think that they can sell this to people?
[02:26:31.007 --> 02:26:34.249]  Well, they're not only arrogant, in my opinion, they're demon-possessed, okay?
[02:26:34.289 --> 02:26:36.630]  And when I say possessed, I want to make this clear.
[02:26:36.650 --> 02:26:40.613]  That's not a liberty or a metaphor I'm taking with the English language.
[02:26:40.973 --> 02:26:45.595]  There are other entities controlling their speech, their thoughts, and their deeds.
[02:26:46.016 --> 02:26:54.200]  But isn't it amazing that these entities that... Remember this, the Antichrist is going to make war by supposedly being a man of peace, okay?
[02:26:54.661 --> 02:26:56.922]  And isn't that what we're seeing right now, you know?
[02:26:57.362 --> 02:27:04.370]  Is that fascinating that as supposedly the peace movement's out there, more people are dying, more men, more women, more children?
[02:27:04.630 --> 02:27:14.741]  And I gotta tell you Alex, I have been told by high-ranking military officials that the guys that are controlling everything are into Luciferian worship.
[02:27:14.801 --> 02:27:17.084]  This is for men who have been tortured.
[02:27:17.564 --> 02:27:22.669]  Under the current plans that are in the White House, you know?
[02:27:23.029 --> 02:27:23.630]  It's amazing.
[02:27:23.890 --> 02:27:28.774]  If you settle for torture, you yourself are going to be on the end of the torturer's hand.
[02:27:28.855 --> 02:27:29.715]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:32.218 --> 02:27:33.178]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.199 --> 02:27:35.280]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:38.864]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.097 --> 02:27:47.583]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:48.023 --> 02:27:52.247]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:52.668 --> 02:27:59.535]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:27:59.955 --> 02:28:06.681]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:07.001 --> 02:28:08.602]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:28:08.902 --> 02:28:12.085]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:12.365 --> 02:28:14.827]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[02:28:29.077 --> 02:28:30.838]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.

[02:29:04.275 --> 02:29:04.896]  I don't know.
[02:29:23.336 --> 02:29:23.796]  We're good to go.
[02:29:42.818 --> 02:29:49.640]  This is Elizabeth Border, author of the two books set, America Attacked and Chaos and Chemtrails.
[02:29:50.020 --> 02:29:56.422]  I wrote these books because I believe that every American should have the vital chemtrails research info.
[02:29:56.902 --> 02:30:06.804]  I was much heartened and encouraged when a radio listener recently wrote me, quote, you are truly a great writer, so clear and powerful and thorough in your communication.
[02:30:07.284 --> 02:30:10.745]  You have the strength to forge ahead in the midst of darkness.
[02:30:11.045 --> 02:30:13.727]  And you also believe in the power of goodness and truth.
[02:30:14.347 --> 02:30:17.049]  I hope you listeners will order these crucial books.
[02:30:17.610 --> 02:30:21.893]  Send your check for $32 post-pay to Radio Liberty P.O.

[02:30:27.336 --> 02:30:27.396]  1-800-544-8927.
[02:30:49.679 --> 02:30:50.940]  Welcome back.
[02:30:50.960 --> 02:30:58.446]  Thank you for joining us on this important Friday edition.
[02:31:19.148 --> 02:31:21.430]  Jim, Mike, Robert, Art, Pat.
[02:31:22.451 --> 02:31:24.212]  We're going to get to all of you with Steve Quayle.
[02:31:24.232 --> 02:31:26.373]  Be sure to visit his website, SteveQuayle.com.
[02:31:26.794 --> 02:31:32.718]  We have links to his website up on Infowars.com right now.
[02:31:32.898 --> 02:31:35.100]  And also, he is a prolific author.
[02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:37.702]  We'll tell you about some of his books.
[02:31:37.722 --> 02:31:40.904]  Well, I noticed that my Infowars.com does not have him.
[02:31:41.644 --> 02:31:49.211]  Posted up there, so I'll make sure that Steve Quayle's link gets put up there and we'll also give you the spelling.
[02:31:49.451 --> 02:31:49.872]  Interesting.
[02:31:50.812 --> 02:31:58.299]  Before we go back to our guest, I wanted to let listeners know that we have a great sponsor.
[02:31:58.339 --> 02:32:01.262]  It's a thick book, but an easy read and it comes with three CDs.
[02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:05.482]  Everything you ever wanted to know about getting out of debts, debts, how they work.
[02:32:05.502 --> 02:32:08.083]  This is just the mainline info, but most people don't know this.
[02:32:08.663 --> 02:32:09.883]  I thought I knew a lot about this stuff.
[02:32:09.983 --> 02:32:11.144]  I learned a lot.
[02:32:11.184 --> 02:32:18.367]  This is good sound info, and I hope that you will check in to the Debtor's Secret Weapon.
[02:32:18.407 --> 02:32:18.987]  That's the book.
[02:32:19.007 --> 02:32:22.309]  It comes with three CDs with text and audio.
[02:32:22.429 --> 02:32:25.130]  One of them has like 60-something hours of presentations of audio.
[02:32:25.828 --> 02:32:38.297]  The book, Debtor's Secret Weapon, and it's very interesting too, it's not boring, three audio CDs, outn90.com, outn90.com, the website is outn90, that's just O-U-T-I-N-90.com, or 877-327-0365, 877-327-0365.
[02:32:48.917 --> 02:32:51.578]  And how to stop getting harassing phone calls.
[02:32:51.618 --> 02:32:54.559]  Understand how creditors will try to seize your assets and how to keep them from doing it.
[02:32:54.919 --> 02:32:56.819]  How to keep your assets but lose your debts.
[02:32:57.239 --> 02:33:01.061]  Learn how to obtain good credit regardless of your past credit history.
[02:33:01.081 --> 02:33:05.582]  877-327-0365 or outin90.com.
[02:33:05.602 --> 02:33:12.464]  There's a banner also up on prisonplanet.com if you miss that phone number or if you miss that web address outin90.com.
[02:33:12.504 --> 02:33:16.105]  You can just go to prisonplanet.com and find the banner on the right hand side right there.
[02:33:22.505 --> 02:33:26.766]  I got a bunch of callers here, and we've got Steve Quayle on with us, who we could have on for 10 hours.
[02:33:26.786 --> 02:33:28.546]  I want to start having him on more often.
[02:33:29.666 --> 02:33:31.447]  And we've got Luke Rudowsky waiting in the wings.
[02:33:31.487 --> 02:33:37.468]  They confronted, this video's up on prisonplanet.com, Larry Silverstein, the owner, who said that they gave the order to pull the building.
[02:33:37.508 --> 02:33:45.730]  Now we have firefighters and police and emergency workers we've interviewed, not just the video of them that day saying, get back, they're going to blow the building up, get back, they're going to blow the building up.
[02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:47.490]  We now have those actual interviews.
[02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:49.751]  Some of those are in loose change, final cut that just came out.
[02:33:51.904 --> 02:34:19.444]  Shifting gears into government-sponsored terror in 9-11, having BBC report 25 minutes before it fell exactly how it would fall with the exact official story shows false start scripting, and now with the vast majority of Americans and major polls believing it's an inside job, and with the credibility of the establishment imploding, and now they're desperately saying we're all terrorists because we don't believe them anymore, where do you see all this going, Steve?
[02:34:20.137 --> 02:34:26.204]  Well, again, I see a very, very dangerous future, and I'm talking in the next year.
[02:34:26.244 --> 02:34:27.466]  I'm not talking beyond that.
[02:34:27.526 --> 02:34:29.328]  I've got to tell you, Alex, you're on a 9.
[02:34:29.408 --> 02:34:29.748]  I'm on a 9+.
[02:34:30.929 --> 02:34:33.352]  I don't see this thing going past October of next year.
[02:34:33.372 --> 02:34:36.075]  I'm not saying it's the end of the world, but I am telling you this.
[02:34:36.196 --> 02:34:39.479]  The bottom line is that, remember, one of the famous news
[02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:43.421]  Magnus made the statement, the news is what we say it is.
[02:34:43.861 --> 02:34:50.444]  That's why you have your website, I have my website, others have all the wonderful websites out there that are trying to tell people the real news.
[02:34:50.484 --> 02:34:55.125]  But the bottom line is, I think that the Luciferians are going to make their move really quick.
[02:34:55.165 --> 02:34:58.186]  Now the question is, do they do it through a financial collapse first?
[02:34:58.246 --> 02:35:00.487]  Do they do it through a red flag?
[02:35:00.747 --> 02:35:02.488]  Listen, I've got to tell you Alex, there are
[02:35:02.868 --> 02:35:09.731]  There are men that live in your area, a lot of retired special operations people and stuff that know what's going on.
[02:35:09.772 --> 02:35:10.432]  But you know what?
[02:35:10.492 --> 02:35:15.134]  The people in this country have got to wake up and vote the scum out.
[02:35:15.514 --> 02:35:22.578]  And I can tell you, I think that quite candidly, as I said last night, that Ron Paul is a mirror to what this country used to be.
[02:35:23.038 --> 02:35:29.402]  And for anybody that calls, someone who believes in the Constitution of Terrorists, then those same people will be there.
[02:35:29.482 --> 02:35:31.764]  They'll call for your execution, you see?
[02:35:32.064 --> 02:35:34.365]  And that's what I don't think people understand.
[02:35:34.726 --> 02:35:35.666]  This thing is escalating.
[02:35:35.726 --> 02:35:44.592]  It's no longer in the realm of just, you know, they don't consider the people that want the truth or tell the truth as pains in the butt.
[02:35:44.732 --> 02:35:48.414]  Now they see them as a target of opportunity to be exterminated.
[02:35:48.475 --> 02:35:50.556]  And I don't make that claim lightly.
[02:35:50.956 --> 02:35:58.099]  I've been told by too many people for too many years, having absolutely hundreds and hundreds of contacts all around the world.
[02:35:58.119 --> 02:36:00.741]  The only way I can validate or verify is the same way you do it, Alex.
[02:36:00.761 --> 02:36:04.262]  You've got to get two or three witnesses unknown to each other that tell you the same thing.
[02:36:04.582 --> 02:36:08.004]  And if you see it happening, and it's coming down, then you've got to sound the alarm.
[02:36:08.044 --> 02:36:12.526]  Now, what people are doing with the alarm, I've got to be honest with you, frustrates me immensely.
[02:36:12.826 --> 02:36:18.449]  Because there should be at least 20 or 30 million people up in arms over Glenn Beck's statement.
[02:36:18.749 --> 02:36:21.593]  There should have been that many up in arms over saying... Well, I agree.
[02:36:21.813 --> 02:36:24.476]  Steve Watson's doing a big report that really boils it all down.
[02:36:24.556 --> 02:36:26.118]  Paul's done an excellent report on it.
[02:36:26.398 --> 02:36:28.601]  We need to email these out to everybody now.
[02:36:28.661 --> 02:36:32.406]  We have the links up on prisonplanet.com and truthnews.us.
[02:36:32.426 --> 02:36:34.108]  Kurt Nemo's done some good stories on this.
[02:36:34.788 --> 02:36:44.477]  And we need to let people know, they're now saying the American people, anti-war, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, are working with Al Qaeda, that the military needs to be used against us.
[02:36:44.837 --> 02:36:47.559]  I'm glad you're freaking out over this because that's a normal response.
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:53.625]  I'm about to go to Luke Radowsky here for a quick report on confronting Larry Silverstein, but here's an example.
[02:36:53.725 --> 02:36:54.706]  I don't want to say you're right.
[02:36:54.746 --> 02:36:59.710]  I don't want to think I'm right with what I see, or all these confluence of things coming together, but here's an example.
[02:37:02.187 --> 02:37:25.854]  My dad's good friend is a prominent lawyer here in town, you know, top 10 Texas Monthly Best Lawyers and he's done some legal work for me and I was over his office and I was setting up some corporations and things a few weeks ago and he was dealing with some business tax issues and so I was at this other big prominent office with him, all these big tax experts
[02:37:26.514 --> 02:37:30.918]  And I didn't even know all these are top lawyers in Austin and this is one of the wealthiest cities in Texas.
[02:37:30.998 --> 02:37:46.750]  I'm a small little nothing client and it turned out one of the owners of this big firm was a big fan and this lady was a big fan and these lawyers they're all coming in and telling me they're going man we used to think you were nuts but they said they said we can't tell you our clients are but billionaires
[02:37:47.390 --> 02:37:48.091]  Are you kidding me?
[02:38:04.039 --> 02:38:08.605]  Well, they're planning the, and I want to say this, they're planning a sacrifice.
[02:38:08.645 --> 02:38:11.910]  Can I tell you what an active duty four-star general told me?
[02:38:12.390 --> 02:38:18.919]  He specifically said, Steve, they are planning to take out 200 billion Americans.
[02:38:19.537 --> 02:38:20.938]  Now, I said, can that be?
[02:38:20.958 --> 02:38:27.002]  A friend of mine, Alex, a totally different realm of the service, Admiral, same story told.
[02:38:27.502 --> 02:38:47.675]  The bottom line is, is that, the only way to do that, by the way, you can't do it effectively with nuclear weapons, you can add, but the best way they're going to do it is through the stuff I've been screaming about, genetically altered viruses that have become cocktails where you're combining Ebola and you're combining smallpox, Ebola pox, or variations, and then you electromagnetically
[02:38:48.115 --> 02:38:56.639]  Supercharge them, and obviously if they're worried about electromagnetic fields attacking the human immune system, well, I better not say that word.
[02:38:56.839 --> 02:39:10.965]  Well, if you do, you know, subject these lethal pathogens to a certain pulsed frequency, I mean, it's just like, it's just like, Alex, all they gotta do is just add something to the spray they've already attacked us with for all these years.
[02:39:11.025 --> 02:39:12.346]  And you know what makes me craziest?
[02:39:12.848 --> 02:39:34.101]  Is that the chemtrail thing is still so poo-pooed, yet, as you've said, you said it yesterday, all the cancers, all the respiratory diseases, all the early deaths, all the senility, all the Parkinson's, everything that's gone on, and man, if you just look at that chart, it starts at the same time the spring starts, and you know, the bottom line is, I've had them laugh at me, I've actually had conversations
[02:39:34.454 --> 02:39:40.822]  With the devils that are doing this, and they said, you know, go ahead, quail, scream at your lungs.
[02:39:40.902 --> 02:39:41.743]  They laugh at me.
[02:39:41.783 --> 02:39:45.207]  They said, go ahead, Christian, try and get their attention.
[02:39:45.247 --> 02:39:47.570]  But you know what he said, Alex, that really did get to me?
[02:39:48.010 --> 02:39:49.292]  He said, you don't get it.
[02:39:49.492 --> 02:39:50.473]  You just don't get it.
[02:39:50.694 --> 02:39:51.855]  They don't care.
[02:39:52.075 --> 02:39:54.078]  And we're killing them, and they don't care.
[02:39:54.693 --> 02:39:58.295]  That is a conversation I had with a high-ranking Luciferian.
[02:40:14.202 --> 02:40:16.703]  Yeah, we all do what we can, and Silverstein had it coming for quite a while.
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:49.524]  And, uh, it actually came at an awkward moment because we really weren't prepared for having Silverstein there.
[02:40:49.764 --> 02:40:51.765]  We never knew he was even going to be there talking.
[02:40:52.185 --> 02:40:55.987]  It was just a public event, and he just showed up right in front of his building.
[02:40:56.427 --> 02:41:02.191]  And, uh, we had great guys like Alex and Brian, you know, seize the opportunity and take advantage of his talk.
[02:41:02.531 --> 02:41:06.313]  And as you can see in the video, he was going to give a long talk, and as soon as he heard
[02:41:06.741 --> 02:41:11.386]  You know, us questioning him about 9-11, he looked at us, and then he said, OK, I gotta go, and bye.
[02:41:11.627 --> 02:41:16.893]  And he just left, and he ran away, and he knew what we were about.
[02:41:18.533 --> 02:41:26.901]  Well you're literally, you guys are 10 feet from him and one of the fellows got right in his face with a sign, that's not too clear on the video but they talk about it on the video.
[02:41:27.401 --> 02:41:29.023]  I mean he looks like a deer in the headlights.
[02:41:29.083 --> 02:41:37.671]  Last weekend Sean Hannity got confronted by some of our listeners that he did a fabulous job and he was laughing at them until they said InfoWars.com and then he looked scared.
[02:41:38.011 --> 02:41:39.513]  Why do you think they're so scared Luke?
[02:41:40.063 --> 02:41:40.884]  Because we're winning.
[02:41:40.924 --> 02:41:42.905]  Because we're winning this informational warfare.
[02:41:42.965 --> 02:41:46.247]  Because we're doing the job that the mainstream media is not doing.
[02:41:46.887 --> 02:41:52.311]  Tom and Matt from We Are Change Upstate New York, they did an excellent job confronting Sean Hannity.
[02:41:52.411 --> 02:41:54.392]  I mean, he just looked petrified.
[02:41:54.412 --> 02:41:55.092]  He looked scared.
[02:41:55.332 --> 02:42:00.456]  And I think it was a beautiful moment when Matt handed him the Constitution and said, you should read this.
[02:42:00.896 --> 02:42:03.077]  And he just looked ashamed.
[02:42:03.357 --> 02:42:06.139]  I mean, it's just amazing what everybody's doing.
[02:42:06.599 --> 02:42:08.961]  And we're just seizing the opportunity and making the best out of it.
[02:42:09.992 --> 02:42:16.896]  WeAreChange.org raised over $11,000, gave it directly to first responder groups, the Feel Good Foundation and others.
[02:42:17.736 --> 02:42:22.319]  And again, Luke, I just commend you and WeAreChange New York, a great example to everybody.
[02:42:22.719 --> 02:42:35.306]  Steve Quayle, how important is it that young people and others across the nation are confronting these evildoers, these New World Order people everywhere, and why do they, when we even confront them politely, why do they look so scared?
[02:42:36.010 --> 02:42:40.534]  Because, basically, they know the threats that hang over their heads.
[02:42:40.594 --> 02:42:45.258]  Listen, they're either bought off or threatened off, Alex, and I gotta commend the young people.
[02:42:45.738 --> 02:42:47.219]  God bless them, and I mean that.
[02:42:47.299 --> 02:42:53.084]  These are the young men that are taking up, and the young women, and, you know, I'm 56, okay?
[02:42:53.124 --> 02:43:04.874]  So, obviously, anybody younger than that is young to me, but the point is that they are absolutely terrified, because, see, everything you've said, their program, ladies and gentlemen, the word television programming,
[02:43:05.274 --> 02:43:08.977]  Doesn't exist because for entertainment, it's the program.
[02:43:09.337 --> 02:43:19.224]  And the thing that I think people are recognizing now, especially young people, I know 17, 18, 19-year-old kids that get it, and I know basically PhDs that don't.
[02:43:19.604 --> 02:43:24.647]  So, you know, I think Alex, what's wonderful is young people are grabbing their future, okay?
[02:43:25.048 --> 02:43:28.330]  Rather than let these bunch of devils destroy everything,
[02:43:28.650 --> 02:43:43.937]  They're starting to rise up, and I salute those that do that, because again, Silverstein, whether he sees the deer in the headlights, or Sean Hannity, or any of these guys, look, do you really think Glenn Beck's going to give up his $50 million a year contract, or $50 million over three year contract?
[02:43:44.357 --> 02:43:53.462]  Heck no, and isn't it interesting, right after the contract, listen, I want everyone to realize this, right after the announcement of that new contract was on the front page of Grudge, then all this happens?
[02:43:53.782 --> 02:43:54.062]  Hmm.
[02:43:54.628 --> 02:43:55.489]  Cause and effect?
[02:43:55.969 --> 02:43:57.030]  Alex, the big money.
[02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:58.472]  Listen, what they don't buy.
[02:43:58.532 --> 02:43:59.453]  Here's another statement.
[02:43:59.793 --> 02:44:02.215]  Steve, who they don't buy, they kill.
[02:44:02.235 --> 02:44:07.580]  Who they don't kill immediately, they will launch the biggest character assassination ever.
[02:44:07.880 --> 02:44:19.231]  And the bottom line is, Alex, these young people, and again, you know, I'm just so amazed in a great way that they're taking up that cause because, see, this is the thing you and I talked about last night.
[02:44:19.591 --> 02:44:30.649]  The Luciferians, we call them Lucys, cannot stand the truth because everything that they base their entire existence on is based on a lie.
[02:44:30.669 --> 02:44:31.750]  And you know what it basically is?
[02:44:32.071 --> 02:44:33.373]  They shall be as gods.
[02:44:33.453 --> 02:44:34.495]  And that's why they use
[02:44:34.795 --> 02:44:36.155]  The power of their money!
[02:44:36.175 --> 02:44:43.057]  Well, I get embarrassed when I go to an event and everybody's praising me, and I feel weird, but I always notice the globalists love award ceremonies.
[02:44:43.077 --> 02:44:45.757]  They actually enjoy being given baubles and awards.
[02:44:46.237 --> 02:44:48.078]  They love being little demigods.
[02:44:48.498 --> 02:44:53.599]  Luke, I want to get you on, coming up this weekend or next week, to talk about this incredible information.
[02:44:53.639 --> 02:44:55.399]  WeAreChange.org.
[02:44:55.519 --> 02:44:57.539]  Good job, and I salute all of you, my friend.
[02:44:57.779 --> 02:45:00.280]  We're never going to stop, and it's our future that we're fighting for.
[02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:01.320]  Absolutely.
[02:45:01.360 --> 02:45:03.582]  Luke, thank you for coming on with that quick report.
[02:45:03.942 --> 02:45:07.084]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Quayle dot com.
[02:45:07.524 --> 02:45:09.045]  And spell that out for him, Steve.
[02:45:09.425 --> 02:45:14.508]  Sure, it's just S-T-E-V-E-Q-U-A-Y-L-E dot com.
[02:45:14.828 --> 02:45:18.550]  Or just Google Steve Quayle and then his Q-Files website will pop up.
[02:45:18.590 --> 02:45:19.771]  Let's take a few calls here.
[02:45:20.491 --> 02:45:22.172]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jim in New York.
[02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:23.093]  Jim, thanks for holding.
[02:45:24.454 --> 02:45:25.014]  Hello, Alex.
[02:45:25.314 --> 02:45:25.574]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:25.594 --> 02:45:28.396]  This is Jim from New York and there's a couple of things I wanted to say.
[02:45:28.456 --> 02:45:29.917]  I'm very angry at this thing with the
[02:45:30.450 --> 02:45:31.330]  I don't know.
[02:45:31.350 --> 02:45:33.011]  I'm not totally convinced.
[02:45:33.271 --> 02:45:33.991]  I know what you say.
[02:45:59.673 --> 02:46:02.414]  You know, and part of me agrees with that.
[02:46:02.474 --> 02:46:08.217]  Now, I'm not saying I have any smart, right answers, but I think there's a point where you wait too long and that's it.
[02:46:08.577 --> 02:46:17.241]  You know, you can buy all, with the way they invade your computers, your phones, your this, your that, you buy all the gold you want, and then they just come to your house like gangsters and take it from you.
[02:46:17.817 --> 02:46:19.619]  So what are you going to do?
[02:46:20.679 --> 02:46:23.021]  We get on the road every day and get run over and die.
[02:46:23.041 --> 02:46:25.663]  It doesn't mean we're 100% going to win the fight.
[02:46:26.804 --> 02:46:30.267]  You do what you can to protect yourself and you're never perfectly safe.
[02:46:30.287 --> 02:46:31.528]  We're not trying to be safe.
[02:46:31.568 --> 02:46:34.230]  We're trying to position ourselves to be independent.
[02:46:35.143 --> 02:46:42.348]  Well, first of all, the bottom line is that, you know, we've got to do what we can to protect our families and protect our brethren.
[02:46:42.408 --> 02:46:56.177]  And I mean brethren, the people that you care about, Alex, that I care about, our listeners, our supporters for all these years, you know, those are the people that I feel are absolutely motivated to do everything I can to help in any way, shape,
[02:46:57.057 --> 02:47:01.059]  But I think the bottom line is that I don't think people understand what I said.
[02:47:01.559 --> 02:47:04.240]  These guys, I used to believe you could turn around.
[02:47:04.420 --> 02:47:05.401]  I don't, okay?
[02:47:05.761 --> 02:47:08.342]  I believe what we're doing is we're buying people time.
[02:47:08.442 --> 02:47:21.247]  I believe, just like the good, when I say, and there are wonderful, wonderful military people that are fighting to keep the Luciferians who control other aspects of the military at bay, but there comes a point
[02:47:21.767 --> 02:47:24.129]  When you cannot fight the judgment of God.
[02:47:24.169 --> 02:47:26.951]  And this is one thing that I think is lacking in most discussions.
[02:47:27.312 --> 02:47:28.733]  Look, I'm not ashamed to say it.
[02:47:28.833 --> 02:47:30.694]  I've been saying it for 15 years.
[02:47:31.135 --> 02:47:34.998]  If this country doesn't turn around and repent, we're going to get judged.
[02:47:35.058 --> 02:47:37.080]  And I believe we've crossed the red line, Alex.
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:38.361]  That's my own personal opinion.
[02:47:38.641 --> 02:47:42.604]  And I believe that's what makes all your warnings before different than the ones now.
[02:47:42.944 --> 02:47:44.766]  Because you know something's changed.
[02:47:44.826 --> 02:47:45.907]  Everybody I talk to, Alex,
[02:47:46.247 --> 02:47:52.531]  And I'm talking about people that have been in the fight for longer than I have are saying, you know, and I want to make this clear.
[02:47:52.711 --> 02:47:53.952]  This is not hopeless.
[02:47:54.032 --> 02:47:56.494]  This is prophecy being fulfilled.
[02:47:56.574 --> 02:48:00.797]  But you've got to realize that your hope has to be in someone greater than you.
[02:48:01.057 --> 02:48:02.958]  And that's why I'm not ashamed of Jesus.
[02:48:03.278 --> 02:48:04.880]  You know, the second Psalm says this.
[02:48:16.367 --> 02:48:17.827]  That's the attack on Christians.
[02:48:18.067 --> 02:48:19.368]  That's why it's happening.
[02:48:20.368 --> 02:48:28.669]  I agree with you, but in the churches themselves, the world looks at churches and thinks that's Pastor Hagee saying Jesus is the Messiah.
[02:48:30.629 --> 02:48:31.390]  It's pretty amazing.
[02:48:31.410 --> 02:48:34.170]  We're going to have to move quick for Mike, Robert, Art, and Pat.
[02:48:34.190 --> 02:48:35.350]  We'll try to get you all in.
[02:48:35.370 --> 02:48:38.631]  30, 40 seconds apiece of comment from Steve on each one.
[02:48:39.171 --> 02:48:40.291]  But I want to hear from you.
[02:48:40.491 --> 02:48:41.651]  I'll just try to jam it all in.
[02:48:42.371 --> 02:48:43.752]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:43.772 --> 02:48:45.852]  A new world order.
[02:48:46.599 --> 02:48:51.761]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:51.821 --> 02:48:53.702]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:54.382 --> 02:48:56.583]  Isn't their objective being world domination?
[02:48:57.103 --> 02:48:59.564]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:00.305 --> 02:49:07.768]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:07.788 --> 02:49:15.611]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:15.991 --> 02:49:19.573]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:19.953 --> 02:49:22.474]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:22.534 --> 02:49:23.674]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:23.694 --> 02:49:24.455]  They're not after money.
[02:49:24.475 --> 02:49:25.535]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:25.735 --> 02:49:26.516]  They're after power.
[02:49:26.736 --> 02:49:27.536]  That's what they're after.
[02:49:27.876 --> 02:49:32.438]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:50:04.102 --> 02:50:13.452]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:50:13.712 --> 02:50:17.216]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:50:17.456 --> 02:50:24.564]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:51:31.901 --> 02:51:32.282]  Day after day
[02:51:53.604 --> 02:51:59.547]  Steve Quayle.com's the website.
[02:51:59.647 --> 02:52:11.274]  I went through a key analysis in the first hour of this whole police state move declaring basically 80 plus percent of America terrorists and saying the military should be used against us.
[02:52:12.254 --> 02:52:13.795]  A major escalation.
[02:52:13.835 --> 02:52:15.376]  It's been done all over by these people.
[02:52:15.476 --> 02:52:16.216]  Very serious.
[02:52:16.256 --> 02:52:20.739]  So the show restarts in about five minutes at Infowars.com with the screens if you missed it.
[02:52:22.957 --> 02:52:26.300]  Robert is hung up, so let's go to Mike in Canada and then Art and Pat.
[02:52:26.680 --> 02:52:27.881]  Mike, you're on the air with Steve Quayle.
[02:52:27.921 --> 02:52:28.242]  Go ahead.
[02:52:28.662 --> 02:52:29.403]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:52:29.843 --> 02:52:30.083]  Good.
[02:52:30.824 --> 02:52:31.725]  Keep up the good work, buddy.
[02:52:31.745 --> 02:52:33.766]  A couple things I just wanted to talk about here.
[02:52:34.067 --> 02:52:39.411]  Up in Canada, they've been running a lot of commercials recently about preparing for 72 hours, urging residents.
[02:52:40.132 --> 02:52:43.054]  Yeah, that way the government can say, see, we told you to get ready.
[02:52:43.234 --> 02:52:44.375]  They're doing the same thing here.
[02:52:44.455 --> 02:52:46.037]  It's, you know, get ready now.
[02:52:47.057 --> 02:52:48.098]  Get set, get ready.
[02:52:48.559 --> 02:52:48.859]  Steve?
[02:52:49.747 --> 02:52:52.569]  Well, I mean, a 72-hour kit is ridiculous.
[02:52:52.609 --> 02:52:54.910]  I'm telling people they better prepare for the duration.
[02:52:54.990 --> 02:53:00.533]  My definition of the duration is absolutely the worst-case scenario for a minimum of one year.
[02:53:00.933 --> 02:53:07.477]  I can tell you the powers that be believe that they'll starve everyone in the United States into submission in under six months, especially when they cut the power.
[02:53:07.797 --> 02:53:08.998]  That's been told to me, Alex.
[02:53:09.418 --> 02:53:25.420]  By the way, the IMF documents that Stiklis brought out, they call it the IMF riot, it's at the end of my book, this is Mayfring News, where they do in Argentina, other places, once they crash an economy, they turn the power and water off to cause total cratering.
[02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:26.460]  Absolutely.
[02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:40.046]  So, you know, when I hear this from all of the powers that, and I say powerful men who still love this country, you know, they call me, and I'm sure they do the same thing to you, and they say, warn the people, warn the people, warn the people.
[02:53:40.326 --> 02:53:41.606]  These are people that have children.
[02:53:41.626 --> 02:53:43.907]  These are people that have grandchildren, and they're scared to death.
[02:53:43.947 --> 02:53:45.548]  I want to go back on something else, Alex.
[02:53:46.108 --> 02:53:56.651]  Because of the business I'm in and how long I've been in it, and I know a lot of people around the world, I can tell you unequivocally that the billionaires and the guys with the hundreds of millions are fleeing right now.
[02:53:56.851 --> 02:53:57.632]  No, I know they are.
[02:53:58.012 --> 02:53:58.772]  Art, anything else?
[02:53:58.852 --> 02:53:59.772]  I mean, Mike, anything else?
[02:54:02.033 --> 02:54:02.493]  He's gone.
[02:54:02.593 --> 02:54:03.273]  Art in Kansas.
[02:54:03.293 --> 02:54:03.834]  You're up next.
[02:54:03.854 --> 02:54:04.254]  Go ahead.
[02:54:04.274 --> 02:54:05.874]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:06.174 --> 02:54:06.414]  Hi.
[02:54:06.875 --> 02:54:13.316]  That bumper music you just played, the Fools on the Hill, that's the only song the Beatles ever wrote about Congress.
[02:54:15.749 --> 02:54:25.317]  Uh, this, uh, I wish you would get in touch with Tex Mars and do a show on the Noahide laws, because I think that's where all these execution laws are leading to.
[02:54:25.958 --> 02:54:27.920]  That would be the ultimate sacrifice.
[02:54:29.361 --> 02:54:29.861]  Interesting.
[02:54:29.921 --> 02:54:30.942]  Any comments on that, Steve?
[02:54:31.223 --> 02:54:32.564]  Well, I think absolutely.
[02:54:32.584 --> 02:54:41.852]  I mean, under the Noahide laws, as the caller has identified, uh, anybody who confesses Jesus as Lord is a heretic, and they intend to cut their heads off.
[02:54:41.932 --> 02:54:43.173]  Am I not correct, caller?
[02:54:45.538 --> 02:54:45.798]  Art?
[02:54:46.118 --> 02:54:54.804]  Madeleine Albright a while ago, her father was the head of the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia, and they had to get out because the people were catching on to them.
[02:54:55.145 --> 02:54:58.247]  So she just shows up here as our Secretary of State.
[02:54:58.487 --> 02:55:00.208]  No, I know, you couldn't make this stuff up.
[02:55:00.248 --> 02:55:00.889]  Thank you, Art.
[02:55:01.129 --> 02:55:02.930]  Pat in New York, last caller, go ahead.
[02:55:02.950 --> 02:55:09.895]  Thank you for taking my phone call, and thank you also for standing side by side with us all fighting the New World Order.
[02:55:09.915 --> 02:55:10.675]  I appreciate that.
[02:55:11.744 --> 02:55:14.168]  Yeah, Steve, this is a slam dunk.
[02:55:14.469 --> 02:55:15.250]  This is great.
[02:55:15.290 --> 02:55:16.853]  I hope you have him back on again, Alex.
[02:55:17.033 --> 02:55:21.060]  I want to make a comment also.
[02:55:22.444 --> 02:55:37.587]  Not only do we need to know what these Luciferians think, I am a born-again Christian, I'm a believer in Christ, but these Christians today, I'll give you for instance, Hosea 8.4 says, they have set up kings, but not by me, they have made princes, and I knew it not.
[02:55:37.887 --> 02:55:47.229]  Now that flies right in the face of Romans 13, but yet, none of the Christian brothers that I know will even get into that verse.
[02:55:47.549 --> 02:55:48.969]  We're out of time, Steve Quayle?
[02:55:49.708 --> 02:55:50.910]  Well, I agree with the caller.
[02:55:50.950 --> 02:55:55.134]  The bottom line is Christians say God says his people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[02:55:55.515 --> 02:56:01.401]  Thank you, Alex, for what you do to inform the people of this country what awaits them if they don't stand up.
[02:56:02.222 --> 02:56:04.004]  SteveQuayle.com.
[02:56:04.084 --> 02:56:05.246]  Thank you for coming on, Steve.
[02:56:05.606 --> 02:56:06.427]  You're more than welcome.
[02:56:07.743 --> 02:56:12.266]  All right, the transmission restarts at InfoWars.com right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:12.286 --> 02:56:16.108]  I'll be back live this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m., and Ron Paul's on the show next week.
[02:56:16.428 --> 02:56:19.870]  Now get out there and take on the new old order and get Endgame out to everybody.
[02:56:23.612 --> 02:56:25.673]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:56:26.233 --> 02:56:29.055]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
