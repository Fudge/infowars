[00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:06.440]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.101 --> 00:00:08.201]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.861 --> 00:00:09.962]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.622 --> 00:00:11.443]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.183 --> 00:00:13.083]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.764 --> 00:00:17.725]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.946 --> 00:00:22.067]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:34.313]  Another very important broadcast transmission against tyranny lined up for you today.
[00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:42.479]  He did his maiden voyage in talk radio on the subject of 9-11 being an inside job about a month ago.
[00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:47.462]  He's Warren Cucurillo, lead guitarist and of course the main songwriter.
[00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:49.099]  I think so.
[00:01:08.173 --> 00:01:19.537]  That he's not allowed to put all of it out here on air, but he's going to put some of it out here on air about the New World Order and coming fascism to the United States.
[00:01:20.398 --> 00:01:26.920]  So, Warren Cucurillo coming up, joining us from New York, he's there on business, opening a new big restaurant in New York, normally in L.A.
[00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:36.824]  A good time for him to be on vacation, or working vacation, because L.A., parts of it, and parts of San Diego County and to Malibu are on fire
[00:01:37.936 --> 00:01:39.057]  Right now, as you know.
[00:01:39.618 --> 00:01:43.001]  So, Warren Cucurillo joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:01:43.021 --> 00:01:52.329]  And, of course, Jesse Benton, the media relations head, press secretary for the Ron Paul 2008 campaign.
[00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.130]  Ron Paul is now a first-tier candidate.
[00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:55.412]  Unbelievable!
[00:01:55.432 --> 00:01:58.835]  The mainstream media admits he's now first-tier and could win
[00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:04.180]  And came in number three above Fred Thompson in a poll of conservatives.
[00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:10.427]  Very important poll they do every two years in the presidential and of course the off-year congressional election.
[00:02:11.728 --> 00:02:14.191]  Huge situation that came out over the weekend.
[00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:20.758]  A lot of censorship, a lot of Fox News attacking Paul now or simply ignoring him in their papers.
[00:02:21.838 --> 00:02:23.399]  Not even mentioning they got 3rd place.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.484]  Mentioning 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, but not 3rd.
[00:02:28.524 --> 00:02:29.464]  Not even mentioning him.
[00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:31.046]  Kind of memory-holing him.
[00:02:31.366 --> 00:02:35.729]  We got Jesse Benton coming on in the last 30 minutes of the show today.
[00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:39.833]  We'll also have some open phones in this hour and into the next with Warren Cucurillo.
[00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:42.875]  By the way, he's just a great guy.
[00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:43.696]  So much energy.
[00:02:43.736 --> 00:02:44.196]  So smart.
[00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:45.097]  I love talking to him.
[00:02:45.117 --> 00:02:47.539]  I'm going to have him on routinely here on the show.
[00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.561]  Listeners like him too.
[00:02:51.397 --> 00:02:53.578]  Kind of like I like to have an Aaron Russo on once a month or so.
[00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:55.198]  I guess they're both from Brooklyn.
[00:02:55.218 --> 00:02:56.139]  Just interesting fellas.
[00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.580]  My main editor, Rob Jacobson, is from Brooklyn.
[00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.481]  I like folks from Brooklyn.
[00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:02.001]  They're interesting.
[00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.562]  Got a lot of pizazz, as they say.
[00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:08.864]  I ran into Willie Nelson last night.
[00:03:09.764 --> 00:03:12.905]  And let me tell you, there are a few people that I get really excited about.
[00:03:12.925 --> 00:03:16.286]  I mean, I'm a big Willie Nelson admirer.
[00:03:16.326 --> 00:03:17.207]  I wouldn't even call it a fan.
[00:03:17.507 --> 00:03:18.547]  And not so much of his music.
[00:03:18.647 --> 00:03:19.688]  I love his music.
[00:03:20.228 --> 00:03:20.608]  I love it.
[00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.039]  I love him in The Highwayman, that's the best.
[00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:26.700]  You know, he wrote Crazy that Patsy Cline did.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.681]  I think he sold that song for $50.
[00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:31.641]  I looked it up on Wikipedia, that's what they say, I remember hearing that.
[00:03:33.122 --> 00:03:37.883]  But for $50, he struggled for 20 years and never quote made it.
[00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:39.623]  Then he moved to Austin.
[00:03:40.063 --> 00:03:45.965]  He was born right outside Austin, like two counties up, promise, kind of out by Waco, a little bit east of Waco.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.561]  This is an amazing individual.
[00:03:50.601 --> 00:03:53.823]  Came to Austin in the 70s, made it huge, now he's a world icon.
[00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.426]  He's Elvis level now for a living individual.
[00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:00.088]  And I ran into him.
[00:04:00.148 --> 00:04:08.474]  He was at the Alamo Draft House last night, but it wasn't like when I met Jimmy Vaughn for the first time five years ago, not five and a half years ago when I was premiering Road to Tyranny.
[00:04:08.514 --> 00:04:09.074]  That was nice.
[00:04:09.114 --> 00:04:09.775]  He came to see it.
[00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.037]  He was there to see another movie, but
[00:04:14.235 --> 00:04:15.697]  Uh, well I'll tell you the story.
[00:04:15.717 --> 00:04:18.559]  It turns out he is, he said he likes the work we do.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.742]  And his wife said that too, so that was, that was neat.
[00:04:22.603 --> 00:04:25.345]  But of course we had a camera going out there in the audience.
[00:04:25.746 --> 00:04:28.889]  His wife didn't like that too much, but we didn't even get any footage of Willie, so that's fine.
[00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.131]  But uh, it was, it was, it was really amazing.
[00:04:32.152 --> 00:04:35.054]  You're just all of a sudden having Willie Nelson walk up behind the counter.
[00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:36.896]  All of a sudden people go, oh!
[00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:40.010]  And I look over and it's Willie Nelson sticking his hand out.
[00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:42.931]  That was amazing.
[00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:46.732]  I have to tell you, a few things, stars struck me.
[00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:50.913]  I mean, I've met a lot of big Hollywood stars and frankly, I can almost care less.
[00:04:52.313 --> 00:04:54.354]  But Willie Nelson, my goodness.
[00:04:55.094 --> 00:04:57.395]  I mean, this is the Texas ambassador to the planet.
[00:04:57.855 --> 00:04:58.795]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.915 --> 00:04:59.675]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:59.735 --> 00:05:00.295]  A new world order.
[00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:10.412]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:11.113 --> 00:05:14.115]  It's known as the Bilderberg Movement.
[00:05:14.175 --> 00:05:16.216]  Their objective being world domination.
[00:05:16.737 --> 00:05:19.198]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:27.284]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.273 --> 00:05:35.276]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.717 --> 00:05:39.219]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.121]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:43.302]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.322 --> 00:05:44.082]  They're not after money.
[00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:45.183]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.383 --> 00:05:45.803]  They're after power.
[00:05:45.844 --> 00:05:47.244]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:59.720]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:08.247]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:10.909]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:17.115]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.
[00:07:17.335 --> 00:07:20.478]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.
[00:07:20.678 --> 00:07:23.161]  In 12 hours, it will stimulate collagen production.
[00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:26.664]  And in 12 hours, it will promote elastin growth in your skin.
[00:07:26.924 --> 00:07:27.685]  What does this all mean?
[00:07:27.965 --> 00:07:32.327]  Well this is the stuff that makes your skin firm and healthy and helps you look younger.
[00:07:32.608 --> 00:07:41.753]  Night Skin is real and the results are real and it contains only proven ingredients that work to lighten age spots, smooth the skin and help diminish the appearance of wrinkles.
[00:07:42.053 --> 00:07:44.695]  It's easy and in 12 hours you'll see it works.
[00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:46.276]  Try it risk-free today!
[00:07:46.496 --> 00:07:48.797]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:30.134 --> 00:08:32.575]  Yeah, I ran into Willie Nelson last night.
[00:08:33.436 --> 00:08:37.138]  When I was giving my speech, he came into the theater.
[00:08:38.522 --> 00:08:40.224]  Here is the big news that we have in front of us today.
[00:09:06.213 --> 00:09:10.254]  IMF chief warns, dollar may suffer abrupt fall.
[00:09:11.575 --> 00:09:19.097]  If you care about your savings, if you care about the economy at all, that is just a horrific, horrifying statement.
[00:09:22.198 --> 00:09:34.061]  Connelisa Rice, we have confirmed that Israel is requesting their loan payments, which is basically just given to them, and their aid payments in Euros.
[00:09:34.969 --> 00:09:38.511]  Well, that's a very nice confidence vote of Israel in the United States.
[00:09:38.571 --> 00:09:38.971]  Thank you.
[00:09:39.952 --> 00:09:48.676]  But, I mean, after all, a year and a half ago, Cheney dumped all of his currency assets into the euro and dumped the dollar.
[00:09:48.716 --> 00:09:54.680]  So, when your vice president's buying a house in Dubai and they've moved Halliburton there and he's dumped the dollar, why not?
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.280]  I mean, you know.
[00:09:57.894 --> 00:09:59.336]  Oh man, it sucks treason.
[00:09:59.897 --> 00:10:01.319]  So we'll get into that.
[00:10:01.379 --> 00:10:01.939]  Here's another one.
[00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.622]  Iran breaks with the US dollar.
[00:10:03.862 --> 00:10:07.607]  There's lots of anger on television and TV and radio.
[00:10:08.167 --> 00:10:14.496]  If there's any discussion of people dumping the dollar, people go, it's Iran!
[00:10:14.576 --> 00:10:15.417]  They did it!
[00:10:16.624 --> 00:10:29.193]  You know, for the few yuppies and good ol' boys and fake conservatives and fake establishment liberals out there who might know what it means to have a plunging dollar, it's, you know, the talk on talk radio and everywhere is it's those dirty Iraners!
[00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:30.974]  Them Arabs!
[00:10:30.994 --> 00:10:31.935]  Of course, they're not even Arabs.
[00:10:31.975 --> 00:10:33.736]  Kill them Arab Iranians!
[00:10:34.576 --> 00:10:37.418]  And all they're doing is doing what the rest of the world is doing, dumping dollars.
[00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:42.482]  I mean, I guess they did do it a year and a half after the Vice President, and that's why they're bad, but he's not!
[00:10:43.405 --> 00:10:45.185]  See, that's double-speak and double-think.
[00:10:45.205 --> 00:10:47.146]  You ever wanted to know what double-think is?
[00:10:47.586 --> 00:10:54.788]  If you're out there agreeing with Cheney dumping the dollar, but Iran's bad, see, you're double-thinking.
[00:10:56.928 --> 00:10:58.048]  You're fooling yourself.
[00:10:58.088 --> 00:11:00.209]  You're lying to yourself.
[00:11:00.249 --> 00:11:02.909]  You're consciously deciding not to face that.
[00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:05.270]  So Iran breaks
[00:11:06.716 --> 00:11:07.597]  With the U.S.
[00:11:07.717 --> 00:11:08.057]  dollar.
[00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:14.582]  And the money news that I chronicle each day here at the beginning of the show just gets worse from that point.
[00:11:14.902 --> 00:11:22.147]  The good news is Glenn Beck did a big diatribe last night demonizing 9-11 Truth and attacking us and attacking others for going into Bill Maher's show.
[00:11:22.467 --> 00:11:23.948]  They're panicking all over TV.
[00:11:24.589 --> 00:11:26.310]  And he had a big poll, a push poll.
[00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:31.394]  A push poll is where he told folks, you know, it's all kooky, it's dumb, it's crazy, they're liars, what do you think?
[00:11:32.014 --> 00:11:32.915]  And 66% said they disagree.
[00:11:35.525 --> 00:11:37.007]  Uh, that it's, uh, kooky.
[00:11:37.907 --> 00:11:40.350]  And, uh, 34% agree it's kooky.
[00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:44.013]  And that's the number we... on the low end.
[00:11:44.073 --> 00:11:50.759]  It's always mid-60s at the floor and the ceiling of 84%, believing it's a cover-up and a lie.
[00:11:51.619 --> 00:11:57.805]  So, any way you slice it, any poll I've seen for the last two years... Now, three, four years ago, it was only 45%, and 48%, and 52%, and 55%, and it grew.
[00:12:02.212 --> 00:12:08.994]  And so three, four years ago, yeah, but the last two years it's 64 is the lowest it goes and 84 is as high.
[00:12:09.815 --> 00:12:16.717]  So yeah, you got 20% of the people or less who still believe the official fable.
[00:12:17.942 --> 00:12:21.664]  And so, you can call us all crazy all day long, it isn't working.
[00:12:22.144 --> 00:12:25.345]  But, and that's scientific polls, unscientific polls, they all show the same thing.
[00:12:25.665 --> 00:12:28.747]  I mean, that's what governments study, is indexes of polls.
[00:12:28.767 --> 00:12:31.488]  They don't just look at one or two polls, they look at baskets of them.
[00:12:32.008 --> 00:12:37.910]  And the basket of ongoing scientific and non-scientific polls show the same thing.
[00:12:38.831 --> 00:12:40.792]  They keep showing the same picture.
[00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:42.913]  Depending on the demographic you talk to, 64% up to 84%.
[00:12:47.318 --> 00:12:48.338]  What do you think of them apples?
[00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:54.779]  And I know you know that, but have you told your neighbors that?
[00:12:54.799 --> 00:12:56.060]  Have you shown them all these polls?
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:15.943]  And we have an area on Prison Planet, I think a year ago we did an article where we had, I think it was like 20 something polls, I forget, a whole page after page of polls, screenshots of scientific, unscientific, Zogby, Scripps, Howard, Mason, Dixon, Angus and Reed, and then
[00:13:16.969 --> 00:13:19.010]  They were showing the same thing as the non-scientific.
[00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:26.913]  And frankly, I think these internet IP polls are just as scientific as the phone polls that they call scientific.
[00:13:26.933 --> 00:13:28.813]  The big firms, of course, call them scientific.
[00:13:30.174 --> 00:13:46.220]  But if you've got an IP address where it only lets you vote once off your IP, and that is, you know, 70% of the public's got computers, they're surfing the web every day, and they're out there voting, and it's only one vote per person, that's how all these polls are, what's not scientific about that?
[00:13:46.903 --> 00:13:47.343]  We're good to go.
[00:14:10.208 --> 00:14:14.659]  You and McGregor angered at Britain's insane anti-state says he may leave England because of it.
[00:14:15.361 --> 00:14:17.586]  And he goes through why he's upset about tyranny.
[00:14:18.931 --> 00:14:19.731]  Well, why not?
[00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:21.632]  They're banning knives in England.
[00:14:21.652 --> 00:14:23.912]  They arrest you if someone's assaulting you in your house.
[00:14:23.952 --> 00:14:24.653]  You defend yourself.
[00:14:24.853 --> 00:14:27.193]  They're putting tracker chips on all the cars that go into London.
[00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.214]  They've got telescreens that shout at everyone.
[00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:32.175]  They're going to make you go to the doctor each year.
[00:14:32.215 --> 00:14:33.015]  They're trying that here.
[00:14:33.335 --> 00:14:36.976]  And now, make all staff exercise for an hour, says top health advisor.
[00:14:37.236 --> 00:14:43.698]  See, in England, sounds reasonable, but the road to hell is paved with control freak intentions.
[00:14:44.058 --> 00:14:45.219]  It's not going to end there.
[00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:46.199]  This is all eugenics.
[00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:49.691]  In Britain, law has long arms.
[00:14:49.811 --> 00:14:53.134]  Eagle Eyes, LA Times, with the telescreens that shout at you.
[00:14:53.154 --> 00:14:54.515]  They're now in all over the country.
[00:14:56.397 --> 00:14:59.859]  So we'll go over why Ewan McGregor and others are just flat sick of it.
[00:15:05.784 --> 00:15:10.308]  Israel's saying that they must deal with primitive threats and that time is running out to strike Iran.
[00:15:10.328 --> 00:15:15.793]  Meanwhile, China is testing space weapon and launching moon satellite, Reitz Group says.
[00:15:17.801 --> 00:15:21.242]  Uh, Cheney's saying they've got to go ahead and start the war.
[00:15:21.302 --> 00:15:22.823]  Bush is talking about World War III.
[00:15:23.263 --> 00:15:27.864]  Bush is running around saying that, uh, where is it in my stack?
[00:15:29.205 --> 00:15:30.385]  I don't think I got that printed.
[00:15:30.445 --> 00:15:31.646]  I thought I, oh, here it is.
[00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:32.186]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:15:34.126 --> 00:15:39.328]  Uh, Bush says that Iran can strike
[00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:43.299]  The United States, and then he says another couple sentences and says, by 2015.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:47.341]  And then the quote they put out is, Iran can hit the U.S.
[00:15:47.361 --> 00:15:47.841]  with missiles.
[00:15:48.442 --> 00:15:49.882]  That was the same thing they did with Iraq.
[00:15:49.902 --> 00:15:58.266]  They said, Iran can hit England in 15 minutes, they can hit all of Europe, I mean Iraq, and we've just got to attack them.
[00:15:58.286 --> 00:16:03.508]  They've got missiles, they've got special space beams, EMP devices that'll just knock us back to Stone Age.
[00:16:03.528 --> 00:16:05.349]  I mean, it was total Buck Rogers made up.
[00:16:06.457 --> 00:16:09.560]  I mean, it's questionable even if our black ops government has that stuff.
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.022]  And Iraq admittedly had nothing.
[00:16:12.062 --> 00:16:17.347]  I mean, they had tinker toy scuds that could barely hit Israel a hundred and something miles away, 120 miles away.
[00:16:18.348 --> 00:16:25.554]  And the inspectors had gone in and blown up all the scuds that could shoot any further than 70 miles so they couldn't hit any of their neighbors other than Saudi Arabia.
[00:16:26.035 --> 00:16:28.637]  So, Jordan and Iran couldn't hit Israel.
[00:16:29.784 --> 00:16:30.304]  Doesn't matter.
[00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:39.310]  By the time they were done, the public was running around in fear, looking to the skies for Iraqi missiles that are going to hit us, you know, 8,000 miles away.
[00:16:41.211 --> 00:16:42.232]  Facts didn't matter.
[00:16:42.352 --> 00:16:43.332]  Info didn't matter.
[00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:44.993]  Nothing matters.
[00:16:45.013 --> 00:16:47.155]  They just don't.
[00:16:47.335 --> 00:16:51.117]  And now Bush is saying they're going to have nuclear missiles within days.
[00:16:51.437 --> 00:16:52.298]  They're going to kill us.
[00:16:52.378 --> 00:16:53.639]  Israel is saying they're going to kill us.
[00:16:54.634 --> 00:16:59.037]  The CIA's own report says eight and a half years, so they could even have a bomb, much less a delivery system.
[00:16:59.557 --> 00:17:00.938]  It doesn't matter.
[00:17:00.958 --> 00:17:03.159]  They've gotta have a war now!
[00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.161]  And Bush can land on an aircraft carrier!
[00:17:09.923 --> 00:17:12.624]  And strut around with a giant codpiece and act tough.
[00:17:12.684 --> 00:17:18.448]  I mean, I just don't know how much more of this we can deal with as a society.
[00:17:23.647 --> 00:17:31.009]  Oh, by the way, before I forget and get into other news, I'm going to be at all the showings, okay?
[00:17:31.449 --> 00:17:33.810]  People didn't like it, and here's the deal.
[00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:39.772]  Tomorrow night, I'm doing my own local TV show while the movie's showing.
[00:17:40.832 --> 00:17:42.753]  So, I've got to go start up the live series again.
[00:17:42.793 --> 00:17:45.133]  So, I can't be there for that, but I'll be there at the end.
[00:17:45.474 --> 00:17:49.815]  We're just going to have a 20-minute speech and 10-minute question and answer at the end of it when it ends at like 9.20.
[00:17:51.872 --> 00:17:54.693]  So I'll go to two TV shows and drive over there and give a speech.
[00:17:54.813 --> 00:17:55.474]  I love seeing it.
[00:17:55.534 --> 00:17:56.094]  I enjoy it.
[00:17:56.654 --> 00:17:58.435]  I'll be there Wednesday night at the end.
[00:17:59.116 --> 00:18:02.397]  Tonight I'm going to be there at the first and I'll give a 25-30 minute speech.
[00:18:04.058 --> 00:18:05.879]  Because I'm not going to do the question and answer after it.
[00:18:06.679 --> 00:18:11.641]  Because I'm going to be on South African Radio this afternoon and More Radio tonight and I'm not whining.
[00:18:12.762 --> 00:18:14.823]  I just can't do everything.
[00:18:15.526 --> 00:18:15.726]  I don't
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.582]  Regardless, I want to see you tonight at the Alabama Draft House.
[00:18:40.602 --> 00:18:42.062]  There are still some tickets left.
[00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:44.664]  I know there's a few tickets left for tonight online.
[00:18:44.684 --> 00:18:45.564]  They're almost sold out.
[00:18:45.904 --> 00:18:47.645]  And they hold back 20 tickets for the door.
[00:18:48.946 --> 00:18:55.829]  Then there was a standby line of about 15 people, and out of 250 tickets sold, about 15 people didn't show up.
[00:18:56.050 --> 00:18:57.730]  So every person got seated.
[00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.631]  It was perfect.
[00:18:58.811 --> 00:19:02.633]  Every person got seated from those that didn't show up, so people got their seats.
[00:19:02.793 --> 00:19:03.573]  It's been standby.
[00:19:04.234 --> 00:19:05.394]  It's perfect.
[00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:06.295]  It worked perfect tonight.
[00:19:07.481 --> 00:19:16.305]  Last night, uh, tonight, uh, I don't know, last night they said there were 20, 30 tickets left for online sales, and they hold back like 20 for the hour before, so you can still get them at the door right now.
[00:19:17.026 --> 00:19:20.567]  And, uh, tomorrow night there is a bunch of tickets left, but I've never had a show that hasn't sold out.
[00:19:20.587 --> 00:19:21.988]  We'll see if this will be the first one tomorrow.
[00:19:22.708 --> 00:19:25.029]  I hope to see you there, and I'll be there again tomorrow.
[00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:34.834]  And then it doesn't show for another week at the Alamo, here in Austin, where you see, there was other, wasn't just Willie Nelson there last night, there was these other stars there.
[00:19:35.795 --> 00:19:36.516]  Not even with him.
[00:19:36.536 --> 00:19:37.477]  I tell you, it's something else.
[00:19:38.117 --> 00:19:39.158]  Austin's happening, folks.
[00:19:39.499 --> 00:19:40.580]  The Alamo Draft House really is.
[00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:47.086]  Then, coming up with the 6th, 7th, 8th, I don't know, whatever the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are.
[00:19:47.606 --> 00:19:48.567]  Week after next.
[00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:50.089]  Three more showings.
[00:19:50.129 --> 00:19:51.090]  I'll be there at all of them.
[00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:52.871]  Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:19:53.232 --> 00:19:56.575]  Endgame hits Prison Planet.tv Thursday night.
[00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:02.417]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.517 --> 00:20:07.279]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.459 --> 00:20:15.242]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.522 --> 00:20:20.884]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:21.104 --> 00:20:28.066]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.366 --> 00:20:33.711]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:33.971 --> 00:20:38.696]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:39.056 --> 00:20:46.643]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:46.983 --> 00:20:53.227]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.527 --> 00:20:54.688]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:54.968]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.054 --> 00:21:04.136]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:04.756 --> 00:21:13.704]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:14.144 --> 00:21:21.330]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:22.043 --> 00:21:27.548]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:21:28.028 --> 00:21:38.857]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:21:39.617 --> 00:21:41.699]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:21:42.199 --> 00:21:43.881]  For more information, call 702-953-0267 or visit
[00:21:49.345 --> 00:21:50.546]  We're good.
[00:22:01.597 --> 00:22:02.778]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, M.D.
[00:22:02.878 --> 00:22:05.159]  I'm the Nutramedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:22:05.299 --> 00:22:08.280]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:09.000]  is a real thing.
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:15.983]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:22:16.103 --> 00:22:21.365]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:22:21.545 --> 00:22:22.286]  We're good to go!
[00:22:48.348 --> 00:22:51.830]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:52.311]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:22:52.371 --> 00:22:54.452]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.222]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:23:04.462 --> 00:23:06.584]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:23:06.724 --> 00:23:09.185]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:23:09.445 --> 00:23:13.788]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:23:13.828 --> 00:23:14.509]  Here's why.
[00:23:14.929 --> 00:23:20.852]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:23:21.093 --> 00:23:27.096]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:23:27.336 --> 00:23:28.197]  But they're not cheating.
[00:23:28.477 --> 00:23:29.338]  We're good to go.
[00:23:59.097 --> 00:24:07.561]  Oh, here's a good one from Johnny Cash.
[00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:10.483]  We'll play a little bit of this and then I'm going to get into what's happening to the dollar.
[00:24:11.743 --> 00:24:13.824]  We could play taps for the dollar right now, couldn't we?
[00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:28.402]  Call him drunk and by the hand, he won't answer anymore.
[00:24:28.522 --> 00:24:34.045]  Not the whiskey drinkin' Indian, nor the marine that went to war.
[00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:37.707]  Get around me people, there's a story I would tell.
[00:24:45.504 --> 00:24:49.385]  About a brave young Indian, you should remember well.
[00:24:50.026 --> 00:25:01.810]  From the land of the Pima Indians, a proud and noble band, who farmed the Phoenix Valley in Arizona land.
[00:25:01.910 --> 00:25:11.273]  Down the ditches a thousand years, the waters grew Irish people's crops, till the white man stole their water rights, and the sparkling water stopped.
[00:25:12.697 --> 00:25:17.699]  Now Ira's folks were hungry, and their land grew crops of weeds.
[00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:22.541]  When war came, Ira volunteered, and forgot white man's greed.
[00:25:22.861 --> 00:25:29.164]  Call him drunken, Ira ain't his evil actor anymore.
[00:25:29.604 --> 00:25:34.446]  Not the whiskey-drinking Indian, nor the Marine that went to war.
[00:25:37.398 --> 00:25:39.239]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:39.279 --> 00:25:40.920]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:26:06.801 --> 00:26:09.986]  IMF chief warns dollar may suffer abrupt fall.
[00:26:24.101 --> 00:26:40.346]  The head of the International Monetary Fund, Rodrigo Rato, warned Monday that there are risks of an abrupt fall in the dollar linked to a loss of confidence in dollar assets.
[00:26:41.917 --> 00:26:51.526]  There are risks that an abrupt fall in the dollar could either be triggered by, or itself trigger, a loss of confidence in the dollar assets, Rado told the IMF Board of Governors.
[00:26:51.566 --> 00:26:58.191]  He also appeared to suggest that Europeans could take steps to temper the strong appreciation of the euro.
[00:26:58.211 --> 00:26:59.312]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:27:00.854 --> 00:27:02.575]  They're always talking out of both sides of their mouth.
[00:27:02.595 --> 00:27:05.998]  They've already had the head of the IMF and the World Bank two weeks ago come out in bad mouth.
[00:27:06.479 --> 00:27:08.921]  The dollar, knowing full well what it would do.
[00:27:10.842 --> 00:27:13.705]  Now they've had Cheney dumping the dollar publicly a year and a half ago.
[00:27:13.745 --> 00:27:20.031]  They've had for four years a public policy, but it's been before that, to weaken the dollar.
[00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:27.498]  It's been a slow, continual slide, as the Financial Times of London said two years ago, so the public doesn't realize it.
[00:27:27.818 --> 00:27:32.663]  So their quote is in a panic, so the elite can reorganize their assets without a crash
[00:27:33.423 --> 00:27:39.069]  Of the world economy, just a slow decline of the American economy.
[00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:47.759]  So they just want to kind of sneak in at night while we're asleep and just real gently put the pillow over our face and real gently press it down.
[00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:48.800]  There, there, there.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.981]  Don't struggle.
[00:27:50.202 --> 00:27:50.982]  There.
[00:27:51.163 --> 00:27:52.284]  There you go.
[00:27:52.304 --> 00:27:53.886]  There you go.
[00:27:54.767 --> 00:28:01.092]  And then when we notice it, they'll blame it on Iran, or they'll blame it on some terror attack that happens right on the day it loses 20%.
[00:28:01.312 --> 00:28:12.021]  You know, there'll be some distraction that'll really come a day after the plunge, but the public will blame it and just run around screaming and waving American flags made in China by slaves.
[00:28:15.544 --> 00:28:18.607]  So, that's the bottom line of what's developing there.
[00:28:22.538 --> 00:28:31.040]  And now to come out and say, oh, it could plunge, and then have that all over the AP, all over Reuters, all over the news, and then it continues to plunge further.
[00:28:33.121 --> 00:28:48.665]  With gold up over $750-something an ounce, and oil going up above $90, and going back up and back down, I mean, it's just, it's extremely important economic news and information.
[00:28:50.706 --> 00:29:05.619]  There is a risk that the exchange rate appreciation in countries with flexible exchange rates, including the Euro area, could hurt their growth aspects, and that in these circumstances, protectionist pressures would worsen, he said, on the final day of the annual meeting of the IMF and the World Bank.
[00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:10.890]  Now, Venezuela a month ago dumped the dollar completely.
[00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:15.051]  Iran has completed a two-year project to completely convert out of the dollar.
[00:29:15.711 --> 00:29:20.773]  Our good buddies, the Saudis, are no longer pegged to their currency of the dollar and are dumping it.
[00:29:21.233 --> 00:29:22.613]  The Chinese are dumping it.
[00:29:22.653 --> 00:29:23.854]  The Russians are dumping it.
[00:29:23.874 --> 00:29:25.034]  The Germans are dumping it.
[00:29:25.294 --> 00:29:26.474]  The British are dumping it.
[00:29:26.494 --> 00:29:27.835]  The French are dumping it.
[00:29:28.095 --> 00:29:29.155]  The Dutch are dumping it.
[00:29:29.175 --> 00:29:31.476]  The Japanese public is dumping it.
[00:29:31.496 --> 00:29:32.716]  The Africans are dumping it.
[00:29:32.936 --> 00:29:34.436]  The Latin Americans are dumping it.
[00:29:34.457 --> 00:29:35.737]  The Canadians are dumping it.
[00:29:36.779 --> 00:29:39.601]  And the average football, yep, he's playing fantasy football.
[00:29:40.262 --> 00:29:41.943]  The men act like little boys.
[00:29:41.983 --> 00:29:48.168]  They run around and giggle and snicker and wear their jerseys when they're 50 years old and eat hot pockets in front of the TV.
[00:29:52.071 --> 00:29:53.132]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.472 --> 00:29:55.113]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.994 --> 00:29:58.716]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.693 --> 00:30:03.815]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[00:30:04.176 --> 00:30:07.259]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:30:07.499 --> 00:30:12.064]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:30:12.445 --> 00:30:15.067]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[00:30:15.548 --> 00:30:22.295]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:30:22.735 --> 00:30:27.958]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:30:28.419 --> 00:30:30.060]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.862]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:30:34.442 --> 00:30:37.784]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[00:30:37.824 --> 00:30:44.809]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:50.552]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.

[00:31:50.621 --> 00:31:50.941]  That's 1-800-875-4254.
[00:32:01.565 --> 00:32:02.226]  It's a fact.
[00:32:02.446 --> 00:32:09.911]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:32:10.051 --> 00:32:18.917]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:32:19.177 --> 00:32:29.724]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:32:29.984 --> 00:32:36.047]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:32:36.267 --> 00:32:41.269]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:32:41.469 --> 00:32:45.951]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:32:46.112 --> 00:32:47.912]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:32:47.972 --> 00:32:48.152]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:32:53.735 --> 00:32:53.996]  I'm good.
[00:33:31.372 --> 00:33:33.273]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:33.313 --> 00:33:34.233]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:35.373 --> 00:33:36.994]  Central Standard Time.
[00:33:37.074 --> 00:33:37.694]  We're live.
[00:33:39.655 --> 00:33:40.315]  You know what, John?
[00:33:40.335 --> 00:33:44.937]  I hate to put you on the spot, but for two weeks I've been wanting to air that clip.
[00:33:46.277 --> 00:33:51.939]  You know the clip with David Aiken and myself and some other fellow talking?
[00:33:52.499 --> 00:33:54.100]  Because it really makes a lot of good points.
[00:33:55.470 --> 00:34:09.121]  And at the end of it, I really haven't aired it yet because I don't like to air things which are flattering myself, but at the end, you know, they've got this speaker, who I haven't identified yet, in this little montage that was put together, but the audio's great, the video's even better.
[00:34:13.665 --> 00:34:23.173]  And he's talking about how it's an illusion, how we keep ourselves in these boxes.
[00:34:24.602 --> 00:34:38.172]  And how we really are blessed that there's even people like me or like you or like anybody who's questioning the official narrative on history and science and everything.
[00:34:39.373 --> 00:34:47.699]  And that I remember being a teenager or before that being concerned with what people thought about me and being horrified, you know, when I was like 10 or 12 years old.
[00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.420]  I got over it by then.
[00:34:49.421 --> 00:35:11.357]  You know, going into a restaurant in front of a bunch of people, kind of being shy, and then I just recognize and read the accounts and the publications out there about psychology that most adults are scared to death, totally insecure, feel bad, and that they want to go along and get along and dress like everybody else and talk like everybody else and do what everybody else is doing because they're scared.
[00:35:11.997 --> 00:35:16.020]  And the first part of being free is just not caring anymore what people think.
[00:35:18.537 --> 00:35:20.538]  I mean, what people think about petty issues.
[00:35:20.638 --> 00:35:31.201]  I do care what people think who I respect, who are activists and who are humanitarians and who are great artists or people that have a drive and a dedication to help others.
[00:35:31.221 --> 00:35:35.482]  I mean, why do so many people want to be involved in charities or involved in helping others?
[00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:40.564]  Are involved in trying to put water systems in in Africa for poor tribes people.
[00:35:40.784 --> 00:35:47.889]  Why would some rich guy who owns a couple car dealerships get religion and suddenly move to Africa and dig the wells himself and pay for it?
[00:35:48.490 --> 00:35:49.911]  And get malaria for that matter?
[00:35:50.191 --> 00:35:53.974]  Because you realize that that feels good because it's what you're designed to do as a human.
[00:35:54.794 --> 00:35:59.098]  It's not some touchy-feely, gooey, sappy, wimpy thing.
[00:35:59.158 --> 00:36:02.140]  It's that that's what you're designed to do in life.
[00:36:04.329 --> 00:36:27.157]  In the hierarchy of needs, going back to human development, the tribal situation, when you became an elder, a leader, you know, a full-grown 35-40 year old male, you had an intense desire after you'd had your jousts and your battles for position, and after you had, you know, gotten your mate, and after you'd done all these things, then you realized it was really about the tribe.
[00:36:27.517 --> 00:36:28.878]  And then you start having a more
[00:36:30.186 --> 00:36:32.688]  Deeply ingrained sense of the species.
[00:36:32.708 --> 00:36:34.029]  I don't know how to describe it.
[00:36:34.109 --> 00:36:35.110]  It's overpowering.
[00:36:35.811 --> 00:36:37.272]  It's an intense drive.
[00:36:37.712 --> 00:36:38.973]  You want to protect innocence.
[00:36:39.514 --> 00:36:40.855]  You don't just want to protect your children.
[00:36:40.875 --> 00:36:42.136]  You want to protect all children.
[00:36:42.536 --> 00:36:44.658]  I remember being, you know, like 18, 20 years old.
[00:36:44.738 --> 00:36:46.799]  I guess I got on the air when I was about 20.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.562]  But just wondering, even before that, what's all this for the children?
[00:36:50.622 --> 00:36:51.443]  For the children?
[00:36:51.543 --> 00:36:52.404]  Oh, it's for the children.
[00:36:52.784 --> 00:36:56.367]  And the media and the corporations, they misuse that and misapply it.
[00:36:57.586 --> 00:37:04.195]  But I was saying to myself, it's so obvious that they're just using this as propaganda, the children, the children.
[00:37:04.776 --> 00:37:05.357]  And they were.
[00:37:05.577 --> 00:37:09.763]  But now I understand why they use it, because once you mature,
[00:37:11.522 --> 00:37:19.985]  And even yuppies and people who aren't awake to the New World Order, they still love their children and care about other children and have this instinctive pull to protect the weak.
[00:37:20.465 --> 00:37:27.988]  But when Jesus is talking about suffering the little children, and he goes on to describe that it's the widows, it's the orphans, it's the weak, it's the cripples.
[00:37:29.228 --> 00:37:31.089]  It's people who can't take care of themselves.
[00:37:31.129 --> 00:37:35.050]  But a New World Order wolf, they want to go in and kill a blind person.
[00:37:35.737 --> 00:37:43.122]  They want to go in and institutionalize some little girl who's born with a cleft palate instead of taking care of her and test drugs and chemicals on her until she dies.
[00:37:44.383 --> 00:37:50.167]  They want to, and the tens of thousands of cases, or I've looked at their cases individually and hundreds of them.
[00:37:50.987 --> 00:38:00.094]  I mean, I've focused in on individuals, you know, in these reports and stories and documents, you know, say they did this to 400,000 women, but, you know, here's one case.
[00:38:00.594 --> 00:38:01.394]  Here's another case.
[00:38:01.434 --> 00:38:02.175]  I've looked at hundreds.
[00:38:03.147 --> 00:38:09.549]  And you personalize and you're like, yeah, I'm scared they'll arrest me and trump something up at a deep fundamental level.
[00:38:09.569 --> 00:38:12.609]  I have that concern in one layer of my psyche.
[00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:14.510]  But that's one little layer.
[00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:20.251]  That's one little part of me that I encapsulate and control and that gets smaller and smaller in me every day.
[00:38:21.852 --> 00:38:23.792]  And it isn't even courage.
[00:38:23.892 --> 00:38:26.333]  It is an understanding
[00:38:28.667 --> 00:38:31.608]  That I have a responsibility to do good.
[00:38:31.688 --> 00:38:36.109]  I have a responsibility to defend people and it's not a burden, it's a blessing.
[00:38:38.129 --> 00:38:39.770]  And why should I be scared of dying?
[00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:41.770]  Why should I be scared of them killing me?
[00:38:43.091 --> 00:38:43.471]  I'm not.
[00:38:43.491 --> 00:38:47.792]  99% of my psyche is just filled up with
[00:38:49.344 --> 00:38:56.370]  The fact that I have a duty to protect those that are being enslaved and being abused, and I can image them in my mind.
[00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:57.592]  Imagine the things going on.
[00:38:57.632 --> 00:38:59.253]  The starving Iraqi families right now.
[00:38:59.793 --> 00:39:03.877]  The starving families in Somalia and Rwanda ongoing.
[00:39:04.438 --> 00:39:07.340]  The mother having her newborn baby taken away for medical experiments.
[00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.964]  You know, they kill it and put it in for malnourished and sell it or use it for body parts.
[00:39:11.004 --> 00:39:11.484]  That's admitted.
[00:39:11.504 --> 00:39:12.425]  I mean, I image that.
[00:39:12.465 --> 00:39:13.566]  Can you imagine that?
[00:39:14.438 --> 00:39:22.205]  And it means that I can't spend my time on ball games or dressing cool or acting studly or even going on trips and vacations and seeing things.
[00:39:22.525 --> 00:39:23.145]  I love travel.
[00:39:23.186 --> 00:39:27.669]  I love seeing beautiful mountains and rivers and forests.
[00:39:27.709 --> 00:39:28.830]  I love going to museums.
[00:39:29.171 --> 00:39:31.993]  I love going to art expositions.
[00:39:32.053 --> 00:39:34.535]  I'd love to go do that and drink a glass of wine.
[00:39:35.936 --> 00:39:41.861]  I can't do it, folks, because I know what they're doing to innocent people right now.
[00:39:41.961 --> 00:39:42.502]  And I know.
[00:39:44.045 --> 00:39:46.668]  That I've got to fight them because it's my very core.
[00:39:46.728 --> 00:39:47.789]  All right, I'm already I got calls.
[00:39:47.809 --> 00:39:48.450]  I want to go to your calls.
[00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:50.772]  I got a bunch of news, but let's just play this clip.
[00:39:52.394 --> 00:39:53.795]  And I forget the name of the clip.
[00:39:53.835 --> 00:39:54.376]  I sent it to you.
[00:39:54.396 --> 00:39:55.297]  Do you know the title of this?
[00:39:57.119 --> 00:40:01.463]  Well, we've linked to it up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com before.
[00:40:02.524 --> 00:40:06.088]  I know that you can type in game Alex Jones into YouTube and then hit
[00:40:07.003 --> 00:40:09.405]  View count, and it's like the 10 or 15th thing in there.
[00:40:09.425 --> 00:40:10.966]  You know, it's right around in there.
[00:40:10.986 --> 00:40:17.890]  You can type Alex Jones Endgame keyword into YouTube, and then click view count, you know, ranking according to how many views it's had.
[00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:26.536]  And, you know, one will say 130,000 views, one will say 40,000 views, and you'll get down, I think it has like 3,000 views when I saw it again a week ago.
[00:40:29.178 --> 00:40:30.258]  So just get it out to folks.
[00:40:31.879 --> 00:40:34.281]  I should just be able to tell people the name of it, but I don't remember.
[00:40:34.321 --> 00:40:35.382]  I just keep forgetting to play it.
[00:40:36.937 --> 00:40:41.479]  Ladies and gentlemen, you bear heavy responsibilities these days.
[00:40:46.181 --> 00:40:50.162]  We laugh at sheep, because sheep just hold everyone in front.
[00:40:50.262 --> 00:40:51.322]  Oh, stupid sheep!
[00:40:52.043 --> 00:40:59.125]  We humans have out-sheeped the sheep, because at least the sheep need a sheepdog to keep them in line.
[00:40:59.766 --> 00:41:03.227]  Humans keep each other in line, and they do it by
[00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:05.851]  We're good to go.
[00:41:22.272 --> 00:41:28.257]  You then realize how small a box you've actually been living in.
[00:41:28.377 --> 00:41:32.820]  Most people have no idea the incredible threat we're under by the global elite.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:41.046]  I mean, how am I supposed to sit here and explain to you the whole world they set up to carry out eugenics operations?
[00:41:41.206 --> 00:41:45.129]  I have discovered that there is a whole parallel government operating.
[00:41:45.149 --> 00:41:47.691]  I have discovered through the whole New World Order.
[00:41:47.711 --> 00:41:49.513]  I have discovered all their documents.
[00:41:49.613 --> 00:41:50.373]  I have posted them.
[00:41:50.453 --> 00:41:51.114]  I have covered them.
[00:41:52.182 --> 00:41:55.567]  You know, you created the Star Reserve in 1913 through lies.
[00:41:56.028 --> 00:41:59.032]  You created 9-11, which is another lie.
[00:41:59.613 --> 00:42:01.976]  Through 9-11, you ended up fighting a war on terror.
[00:42:01.996 --> 00:42:05.001]  And now all of a sudden you're going through Iraq, which was another lie.
[00:42:05.501 --> 00:42:06.743]  And now they're going through Iran.
[00:42:07.504 --> 00:42:10.725]  It is perfectly possible for a man to be out of prison and yet not free.
[00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:15.325]  To be under no physical constraint and yet to be psychologically captive.
[00:42:15.505 --> 00:42:23.407]  The nature of psychological compulsion is such that those who act under constraint remain under the impression that they are acting of their own initiative.
[00:42:23.427 --> 00:42:27.168]  The victim of mind manipulation does not know that he is a victim.
[00:42:27.608 --> 00:42:31.548]  To him, the walls of his prison are invisible and he believes himself to be free.
[00:42:31.608 --> 00:42:35.369]  That he is not free is only apparent to other people.
[00:42:36.121 --> 00:42:37.943]  His servitude is strictly objective.
[00:42:39.884 --> 00:42:44.548]  I'm just warning you, person to person, you better start researching my slides.
[00:42:44.568 --> 00:42:50.093]  You better start looking into what world government and what neo-feudalism and what serfdom means.
[00:42:51.062 --> 00:42:57.105]  Ron Paul and others have pointed out that Hitler and Stalin and people didn't have the nerve to put stuff like this down on paper.
[00:42:57.265 --> 00:42:58.786]  They just did it!
[00:42:58.846 --> 00:43:03.108]  Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe.
[00:43:03.368 --> 00:43:06.250]  The survival of our friends is in danger.
[00:43:08.311 --> 00:43:12.532]  The ultimate goal is to get everybody in this room chipped into the chew with an RFID chip.
[00:43:13.252 --> 00:43:16.453]  And have all money be on those chips and everything on those chips.
[00:43:17.093 --> 00:43:21.755]  And if anybody wants to protest what we do or violate what we want, we just turn off that chip.
[00:43:22.155 --> 00:43:29.257]  Because somebody can sell you something but you don't have to buy it.
[00:43:31.177 --> 00:43:33.938]  When you understand that you've bought into it, that these people have no power at all.
[00:43:34.528 --> 00:43:35.229]  They do have control.
[00:43:35.609 --> 00:43:36.650]  But you have the power.
[00:43:37.611 --> 00:43:39.512]  You give it away.
[00:43:39.652 --> 00:43:47.059]  The fact that we, as ordinary people, even have an Alex Jones, or anyone, is a miracle to me.
[00:43:47.299 --> 00:43:48.020]  It is brilliant!
[00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:55.046]  So when you're getting pessimistic, for a moment think that it's extremely recent times that we've even had the privilege of discovering this.
[00:43:55.947 --> 00:43:57.428]  That is a very recent phenomenon.
[00:43:58.633 --> 00:44:01.815]  And we did find the name of it is, This is the Sound of Revolution.
[00:44:01.835 --> 00:44:03.876]  You type that into Google or YouTube, you'll find it.
[00:44:03.896 --> 00:44:04.977]  This is the Sound of Revolution.
[00:44:05.017 --> 00:44:06.358]  It's even more powerful than the video.
[00:44:06.878 --> 00:44:09.020]  This guy, Aaron Russo, myself, David Icke.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.901]  I don't know who that other fellow's voice is, but I appreciate the kind words.
[00:44:11.941 --> 00:44:13.522]  But it's all of us together.
[00:44:15.383 --> 00:44:16.864]  I mean, I want to build people up.
[00:44:17.064 --> 00:44:19.326]  I want to build up other leaders in this movement.
[00:44:19.346 --> 00:44:20.607]  That's all I've ever tried to do.
[00:44:21.547 --> 00:44:22.908]  And we've built up a lot of people.
[00:44:23.608 --> 00:44:25.410]  We try to give a lot of people a hand up.
[00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.231]  And other people have helped me.
[00:44:28.146 --> 00:44:28.786]  Get the word out.
[00:44:29.247 --> 00:44:30.608]  And it helped build up what I do.
[00:44:31.108 --> 00:44:33.709]  And it's about exposing this new world order.
[00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:36.251]  We're not going to survive if we don't.
[00:44:37.552 --> 00:44:52.041]  Literally, we're going to see more and more economic calamity, more and more wars, controlled bioweapons releases that we'll claim are organic, organically released, that have just developed, or that some terrorists put out.
[00:44:52.821 --> 00:44:54.022]  They're saying this is going to happen.
[00:44:54.042 --> 00:44:55.322]  They're saying they're going to do it.
[00:44:55.903 --> 00:44:57.624]  You can read it right there, plainly.
[00:44:58.939 --> 00:45:00.799]  There's slight veils, slight between the lines.
[00:45:00.819 --> 00:45:03.060]  You know, they say terrorists will release race-specific bio-weapons.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:10.062]  They say it will magically pop up, or it's going to happen, or millions will die from the flu, and all of the super-flu.
[00:45:10.122 --> 00:45:11.462]  I mean, they're behind it.
[00:45:11.522 --> 00:45:12.602]  They're creating it.
[00:45:12.622 --> 00:45:18.364]  They're even then separately in other documents saying, yeah, we want to use race-specific bio-weapons to kill, you know, large numbers of people.
[00:45:18.959 --> 00:45:22.720]  And they're not going to do that until they've got their emergency management system in place globally.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.121]  They're not going to go to the full-bore attacks.
[00:45:25.481 --> 00:45:31.723]  They're going to have little bio-releases that help get the protocols in place, help get the cadres trained.
[00:45:32.884 --> 00:45:34.224]  But you can see them doing it.
[00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:38.385]  You can see them constructing this global guillotine for humanity.
[00:45:39.246 --> 00:45:43.167]  And I'm watching them do it, and I'm just screaming, please, people, pay attention!
[00:45:44.238 --> 00:45:46.039]  This is more important than fantasy football.
[00:45:46.119 --> 00:45:55.103]  I turned around on two different talk radio stations in traffic yesterday, driving up to the Alamo Draft House at night for the showing that we had last night, another one tonight.
[00:45:56.024 --> 00:46:06.189]  And two different talk stations have their sports shows in that time of evening, and they were both talking about fantasy football and real serious about it.
[00:46:06.229 --> 00:46:07.210]  I mean, come on!
[00:46:07.690 --> 00:46:11.632]  Men aren't supposed to be 40 years old, 50 years old.
[00:46:11.652 --> 00:46:13.553]  You're not supposed to be playing fantasy football after you're 12.
[00:46:15.174 --> 00:46:16.655]  That's what boys play.
[00:46:16.675 --> 00:46:33.347]  I mean, if you had your whole life squared away, and your whole society squared away, and the society wasn't unraveling, and the families weren't unraveling, and if we weren't in crisis on every front, and everything was fine and beautiful and blue skies, maybe you could play a little fantasy football.
[00:46:34.548 --> 00:46:37.390]  But they're euthanizing old people all over the world, right here in the U.S.
[00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:43.034]  They're doing horrible things to foster children, and just some evil is advancing everywhere.
[00:46:44.514 --> 00:46:47.655]  And your men are sitting around talking about fantasy football.
[00:46:48.055 --> 00:46:50.395]  By the way, Endgame comes out in three days.
[00:46:50.595 --> 00:46:53.255]  Thursday night, at midnight, or a little bit before.
[00:46:53.275 --> 00:46:57.196]  Hit PrisonPlanet.tv for PrisonPlanet.tv members.

[00:47:09.058 --> 00:47:10.178]  And Endgame's going to be up there.
[00:47:10.558 --> 00:47:11.579]  My weekly TV report.
[00:47:11.639 --> 00:47:13.859]  Thousands of pieces of media we put up in the last three and a half years there.
[00:47:14.491 --> 00:47:14.891]  We're good to go.
[00:47:45.427 --> 00:48:00.654]  I guarantee you all the orders that come in by this weekend are going to be shipped out by the middle of next week and the orders that came in the last week and the week before that are already packaged and ready sitting there in the front going to ship out Monday.
[00:48:01.234 --> 00:48:06.236]  So get your orders in now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:07.185 --> 00:48:17.069]  I just want to say that with the new people we've got here, Tim and Weldon doing the shipping and customer service with Mike, it's gone from being horrible because we were so small.
[00:48:17.489 --> 00:48:22.131]  I just had to spend the money and went ahead and just did and got better people who work more and do a better job.
[00:48:26.493 --> 00:48:29.454]  It's gone from being a C- to an A+.
[00:48:30.235 --> 00:48:31.355]  I think a lot of you have noticed that.
[00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:33.296]  I never really commend them like I should.
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.442]  I want to promote Weldon, but I don't want him to get too big and get out of here.
[00:48:37.482 --> 00:48:38.022]  Actually, I do.
[00:48:38.382 --> 00:48:39.723]  Weldon's got a great country band.
[00:48:41.264 --> 00:48:41.564]  What is it?
[00:48:41.604 --> 00:48:43.125]  Weldon Henson and the Possum Bellies?
[00:48:43.625 --> 00:48:44.246]  Actually, it's what is it?
[00:48:44.306 --> 00:48:48.448]  Weldon Henson and the Hillbilly Outlaws or something like that.
[00:48:48.468 --> 00:48:49.689]  I've got to play some of his music here.
[00:48:49.749 --> 00:48:52.770]  His first album's coming out soon, and it's really good stuff.
[00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.251]  I think Weldon's going to hit it big.
[00:48:54.491 --> 00:48:55.172]  I really do.
[00:48:55.252 --> 00:49:00.054]  Of course, I don't want to lose my producer, too, because Craig Kincaid is his bassist.
[00:49:00.135 --> 00:49:00.815]  He plays the bass.
[00:49:01.983 --> 00:49:03.604]  Alright, now I'm really digressing.
[00:49:03.624 --> 00:49:05.704]  When we come back, I'm going to go right to Joe, right to William.
[00:49:05.724 --> 00:49:07.145]  I promise I'm going to give you both plenty of time.
[00:49:07.205 --> 00:49:07.845]  Others are holding.
[00:49:08.265 --> 00:49:18.528]  Warren Cucurillo is going to be on with us from Duran Duran and Frank Zappa's band and everything else with some breaking news on Frank Zappa, 9-11, and a lot more from New York.
[00:49:18.548 --> 00:49:19.629]  We really appreciate him.
[00:49:19.649 --> 00:49:24.210]  I spilled hot sauce all over my articles, folks.
[00:49:24.250 --> 00:49:26.111]  I flail around out here in the studio.
[00:49:26.131 --> 00:49:30.332]  With talk radio, you turn into a pig because you've got to eat in three-minute breaks.
[00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:35.502]  I'm in here trying to eat breakfast tacos during the break and splattering hot sauce everywhere.
[00:49:35.522 --> 00:49:36.883]  I sound a little distracted earlier.
[00:49:38.345 --> 00:49:43.288]  But, uh, it's just, it's all insane.
[00:49:43.328 --> 00:49:44.789]  Everything's insane these days.
[00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:48.932]  I'm more reflective today.
[00:49:48.972 --> 00:49:50.814]  I'm more reflective than I've been in a long time.
[00:49:53.596 --> 00:49:56.358]  And I just think it's because I've really been meditating.
[00:49:56.838 --> 00:49:59.200]  By meditating, I don't mean that in the Eastern sense, but I've been
[00:50:00.376 --> 00:50:06.620]  Really thinking about what matters and just every day I'm blown away with how blessed I am.
[00:50:06.660 --> 00:50:23.591]  I mean I am just unbelievably dumbstruck, dumbfounded, just absolutely like a bolt of lightning has hit me every day to just walk outside and see just sterling fall weather and
[00:50:24.562 --> 00:50:33.529]  Titanium blue skies and big green trees and happy people and little fat dogs waddling by and just everything just amazes me.
[00:50:34.009 --> 00:50:36.712]  I just... I want that to be clear.
[00:50:37.892 --> 00:50:40.495]  That I don't see the world as dark and bad.
[00:50:40.675 --> 00:50:42.216]  I see the New World Order as dark and bad.
[00:50:42.556 --> 00:50:45.819]  A big festering cancer right in the middle of Valhalla.
[00:50:46.940 --> 00:50:48.221]  Right in the middle of heaven.
[00:50:49.862 --> 00:50:51.063]  Turning heaven into hell.
[00:50:52.592 --> 00:50:57.554]  And every fiber of my soul and my very cells cry out against it.
[00:50:57.734 --> 00:50:58.114]  That's all.
[00:50:58.334 --> 00:50:58.694]  That's all.
[00:50:58.834 --> 00:50:59.134]  Simple.
[00:51:02.095 --> 00:51:03.515]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:04.596 --> 00:51:05.636]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.356 --> 00:51:10.917]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:11.238 --> 00:51:13.958]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:51:14.058 --> 00:51:16.339]  Both their objective being world domination.
[00:51:16.839 --> 00:51:19.260]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:20.021 --> 00:51:27.374]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.358 --> 00:51:35.361]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.842 --> 00:51:39.324]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.704 --> 00:51:42.226]  Bill of Regents makes great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:42.266 --> 00:51:43.407]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.447 --> 00:51:44.127]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.147 --> 00:51:45.288]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.508 --> 00:51:46.249]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.469 --> 00:51:47.309]  That's what happens here.
[00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:55.815]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:55.975 --> 00:51:58.617]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslaving.
[00:51:58.877 --> 00:52:00.357]  You have been warned.
[00:52:01.017 --> 00:52:04.038]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:52:04.358 --> 00:52:09.279]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.519 --> 00:52:13.880]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:23.081]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:23.301 --> 00:52:26.882]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:27.202 --> 00:52:32.226]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.526 --> 00:52:39.231]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:40.411]  What about you?
[00:52:41.051 --> 00:52:46.415]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:53:00.942 --> 00:53:01.222]  Hemp.
[00:53:01.463 --> 00:53:03.504]  The superfood for you and your family.
[00:53:03.885 --> 00:53:07.168]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[00:53:07.648 --> 00:53:07.928]  Hemp.
[00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:11.091]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[00:53:11.432 --> 00:53:11.732]  Hemp.
[00:53:12.072 --> 00:53:18.538]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[00:53:18.878 --> 00:53:22.141]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[00:53:22.401 --> 00:53:26.005]  The protein powder, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[00:53:26.565 --> 00:53:30.907]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.
[00:53:31.267 --> 00:53:37.669]  Loaded with potassium, magnesium, calcium, essential fatty acids, amino acids, and nutrients not available in other plants.
[00:53:38.010 --> 00:53:42.291]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[00:53:42.511 --> 00:53:44.372]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[00:54:53.346 --> 00:54:55.408]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air, sir.
[00:54:55.428 --> 00:54:57.089]  Welcome, thanks for holding.
[00:54:57.129 --> 00:54:59.791]  Then William, Nick and others.
[00:54:59.811 --> 00:54:59.951]  Hello.
[00:54:59.971 --> 00:55:00.011]  Hi.
[00:55:00.031 --> 00:55:01.012]  What's going on, Alex?
[00:55:01.032 --> 00:55:03.073]  We are doing a worldwide transmission in defense of liberty.
[00:55:20.376 --> 00:55:20.656]  Great.
[00:55:21.196 --> 00:55:24.537]  Hey, I'm just now starting to get... Sorry, my throat's a little hoarse.
[00:55:24.557 --> 00:55:24.977]  That's okay.
[00:55:25.017 --> 00:55:25.478]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:55:26.358 --> 00:55:28.278]  I'm just now starting to get into the information.
[00:55:28.299 --> 00:55:30.679]  I learned it from Infowars.com.
[00:55:31.159 --> 00:55:36.621]  I've been asking myself a lot of questions, you know, because it seems crazy that all this stuff is really happening.
[00:55:37.561 --> 00:55:38.862]  But I was watching the news last night.
[00:55:38.922 --> 00:55:45.664]  I see where Bush is trying to veto a bill that stops poor people from getting heat in the United States.
[00:55:46.164 --> 00:55:47.224]  Have you heard of this?
[00:55:48.305 --> 00:55:48.845]  Tell me about it.
[00:55:49.406 --> 00:56:04.335]  It's some kind of bill where the poor people of the United States, I forget exactly what it is, I heard it on CNN last night, where he's wanting to veto the bill and do away with the bill, where it would keep some of the population here from getting heat.
[00:56:05.399 --> 00:56:07.101]  No, I'm not aware of it.
[00:56:07.141 --> 00:56:07.881]  Well, I know this.
[00:56:07.961 --> 00:56:15.088]  I mean, you know, a Blackwater employee on average can get $150,000 for a 7-month tour, but we can't give old ladies free heating.
[00:56:15.308 --> 00:56:15.788]  Right, right.
[00:56:15.868 --> 00:56:17.170]  And that's exactly what I'm getting at.
[00:56:17.490 --> 00:56:19.672]  And then we've got the health issue with the kids.
[00:56:20.472 --> 00:56:21.473]  He wants to do away with this.
[00:56:21.513 --> 00:56:26.578]  He doesn't want our young kids to have health insurance, people that can't afford it.
[00:56:27.136 --> 00:56:32.702]  And then in the same hand, he's turning around and he's wanting $42.3 billion for this war in Iraq?
[00:56:32.722 --> 00:56:35.906]  Well, I mean, it's over $100 billion every six months now.
[00:56:35.926 --> 00:56:35.906]  $190?
[00:56:35.986 --> 00:56:38.228]  I don't remember exactly.
[00:56:38.288 --> 00:56:41.752]  No, he wants a supplemental of, I think it's $44 billion is what I've got here.
[00:56:44.486 --> 00:56:47.108]  I've been asking myself, can this stuff really be serious?
[00:56:47.188 --> 00:56:52.511]  I mean, it's just, uh... Well, let me just tell you... Joe, Joe, it's more sophisticated, okay?
[00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:57.414]  Okay, and you're trying to even look at it now, so that's the first step, is knowing there's a problem.
[00:56:57.434 --> 00:56:58.095]  Let me just tell you something.
[00:56:59.015 --> 00:57:04.279]  Bush has to act like he isn't for big government, for conservative and libertarian constituents.
[00:57:04.419 --> 00:57:08.741]  It would sound great to have health care for children.
[00:57:08.781 --> 00:57:09.482]  Here's the problem.
[00:57:10.166 --> 00:57:19.548]  The state is run by eugenicists, and every time we've had state-controlled health care, as they now have in England, they carry out eugenics, which they're now starting to do again.
[00:57:19.568 --> 00:57:23.649]  Hitler had it, and so you can't give them that much control.
[00:57:23.689 --> 00:57:30.511]  If we had a crew-free market, there would be then massive charity, and people 50 years ago, 100 years ago, didn't go without health care.
[00:57:30.991 --> 00:57:31.452]  We're good to go.
[00:57:47.505 --> 00:57:49.086]  It is a parasitic system.
[00:57:49.787 --> 00:57:54.590]  Look, if you don't have insurance, a birth, I saw these numbers, is over $20,000.
[00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:57.952]  If you have insurance, it's only about $5,000 for your average birth.
[00:57:58.292 --> 00:58:02.095]  So they penalize you, too, for not having insurance to force you in.
[00:58:02.135 --> 00:58:04.116]  The central banks own the insurance companies.
[00:58:04.416 --> 00:58:05.877]  So it's a scam there as well.
[00:58:06.638 --> 00:58:10.360]  What we need is state laws against fraud.
[00:58:10.801 --> 00:58:14.083]  And the fraud is that health care prices are set.
[00:58:14.948 --> 00:58:16.410]  And set by the medical companies.
[00:58:16.450 --> 00:58:24.677]  I'm not saying government does it, but that they have to set a price at a place, just like a restaurant sells a hamburger for the same price to everybody else.
[00:58:25.237 --> 00:58:26.879]  One hospital can have another price, that's fine.
[00:58:27.239 --> 00:58:35.086]  But that hospital isn't going to charge some poor woman $20,000 because she doesn't have insurance, and then charge some rich yuppie $5,000 because they've got it.
[00:58:35.546 --> 00:58:36.927]  Let me try to explain this, okay?
[00:58:37.168 --> 00:58:37.548]  Stay there.
[00:58:41.778 --> 00:58:46.884]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.347 --> 00:59:01.550]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:03.011]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.771 --> 00:59:05.272]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.332 --> 00:59:09.294]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.535 --> 00:59:13.637]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.757 --> 00:59:15.398]  Warren Cuccarillo!
[00:59:27.364 --> 00:59:37.073]  The lead guitarist for Duran Duran, and of course their lead writer, also was in the Frank Zappa's band, is going to be joining us.
[00:59:38.855 --> 00:59:48.544]  I was talking to him this weekend, and he was telling me about a Frank Zappa interview, one of his friends, a journalist came in, that has never been published.
[00:59:50.185 --> 00:59:52.908]  And he's just gonna give you a paragraph or two.
[00:59:54.153 --> 00:59:56.375]  When you call him in a minute, remind him because we talked about that Sunday.
[00:59:56.395 --> 00:59:57.135]  I don't know if he remembers that.
[00:59:57.175 --> 00:59:58.476]  I want to talk about that Frank Zappa thing.
[00:59:59.477 --> 01:00:06.182]  Oh, and John, did you get when I sent you yesterday, a minute before today, Frank Zappa in 1982 on CNN?
[01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:17.171]  I sent it actually Sunday night and it's got time codes where the two comments I want are.
[01:00:18.572 --> 01:00:20.013]  Can you look in your records or
[01:00:21.249 --> 01:00:22.969]  I'll try to go into my memory and remember.
[01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:26.530]  I want to say it's like halfway in.
[01:00:28.911 --> 01:00:31.411]  Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:31.431 --> 01:00:32.331]  18 minutes.
[01:00:32.351 --> 01:00:34.232]  18 minutes, 20 seconds in.
[01:00:34.272 --> 01:00:36.372]  He talks about fascism coming in the U.S.
[01:00:36.992 --> 01:00:38.653]  And there's another clip earlier in there.
[01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:39.413]  It doesn't matter.
[01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:42.293]  Now, let's go to William in Arkansas.
[01:00:42.353 --> 01:00:43.313]  William, you're on the air.
[01:00:43.394 --> 01:00:43.794]  Go ahead.
[01:00:43.814 --> 01:00:45.554]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:46.047 --> 01:00:46.748]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[01:00:47.048 --> 01:00:48.129]  Hey, how you doing, buddy?
[01:00:48.189 --> 01:00:49.390]  It's so good to hear you.
[01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:52.072]  You're a true patriot, that's all I gotta say.
[01:00:52.092 --> 01:00:59.238]  No, I just wanted to run it by you about this news article I've seen in the American Family Voice.
[01:00:59.338 --> 01:01:02.320]  They're a newspaper out of Russellville, Arkansas.
[01:01:02.621 --> 01:01:03.401]  Yes, sir, tell me about it.
[01:01:04.482 --> 01:01:08.565]  It says, Chinese Secret Society Challenges Illuminati.
[01:01:09.106 --> 01:01:10.507]  What it is, is basically
[01:01:13.396 --> 01:01:23.101]  The Chinese have a secret society of 6 million members, including 1.8 million Asian gangsters and 100,000 professionals.
[01:01:23.121 --> 01:01:25.842]  Yeah, that's the former Forbes writer, Benjamin Fulford.
[01:01:26.082 --> 01:01:41.330]  Yes, yes, and I was just reading that about how they've targeted the Illuminati, and they've got a list of these people's names, you know, and it was really, you know, inspiring to see that, you know, something, you know,
[01:01:42.034 --> 01:01:44.896]  They're not going to get away with this New World Order, you know?
[01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:46.997]  That's basically what I wanted to do.
[01:01:47.077 --> 01:01:51.419]  Well, I hope that's the truth, and I don't know if it's true.
[01:01:51.439 --> 01:01:59.964]  I really, I believe that Benjamin Fulver believes what he's saying, and I think a lot of it, I don't think, I know a lot of it is true of what he's saying.
[01:02:00.424 --> 01:02:08.449]  Some of it, quite a bit of it, I'd say 30% of it, and I've listened to hours of it and read it, can't be documented.
[01:02:09.884 --> 01:02:12.626]  But I know there is a worldwide plan for eugenics and extermination.
[01:02:13.267 --> 01:02:19.352]  That's what my new film, you know, a year and a half, really more than that, In the Making, has been about.
[01:02:19.412 --> 01:02:21.074]  He's just gone public, what, the last two months.
[01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:23.276]  And now it's a hot topic.
[01:02:23.316 --> 01:02:25.678]  I made the film and suddenly it's coming out perfect time.
[01:02:25.838 --> 01:02:27.980]  This is a big issue everywhere.
[01:02:29.461 --> 01:02:29.862]  And so,
[01:02:31.603 --> 01:02:33.784]  I'm glad that Pulpert's out there.
[01:02:33.864 --> 01:02:35.504]  I have emailed him and asked him over and over again.
[01:02:35.524 --> 01:02:38.505]  He says he's not doing any interviews right now, so we're certainly trying to get him on.
[01:02:38.885 --> 01:02:39.625]  Anything else, William?
[01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:42.625]  No, I just want to say you're too patriotic.
[01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:43.926]  No, my friend, you are.
[01:02:43.966 --> 01:02:44.646]  God bless you.
[01:02:45.046 --> 01:02:47.286]  Spread the word about the show there in Arkansas.
[01:02:47.386 --> 01:02:48.667]  Nick in Pennsylvania.
[01:02:48.687 --> 01:02:49.147]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:02:50.307 --> 01:02:50.827]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:51.027 --> 01:02:52.368]  My name's Nicholas Kazinka III.
[01:02:52.488 --> 01:02:59.189]  I'm from Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and I'm trying to get together a screening of Aaron Russo's
[01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:02.312]  America Freeing the Fascism in our local theater.
[01:03:03.653 --> 01:03:04.894]  Now, Alex, are you there?
[01:03:05.274 --> 01:03:05.694]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:06.355 --> 01:03:06.955]  Okay, sorry.
[01:03:08.316 --> 01:03:17.103]  Now, I've already talked to the people at the theater, and it costs $600 to basically rent a theater to host a private screening.
[01:03:17.283 --> 01:03:18.764]  How many seats does it have?
[01:03:19.484 --> 01:03:20.805]  It has a capacity of 250 people.
[01:03:22.446 --> 01:03:24.287]  That's a little high, that's a little high.
[01:03:26.049 --> 01:03:29.611]  Well listen sir, you've got to talk to the people that do that over at Freedom to Fascism.
[01:03:29.771 --> 01:03:30.832]  I don't run any of that or anything.
[01:03:31.092 --> 01:03:37.456]  We do sell the DVD at Infowars.com, but I can't actually organize each little event here on air.
[01:03:37.496 --> 01:03:39.658]  The whole show would just be that, but I wish you luck.
[01:03:39.718 --> 01:03:41.459]  Once you get it set up, give us a call back and plug it.
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.240]  It's the most I can do, my friend.
[01:03:43.801 --> 01:03:48.264]  Alright, Warren Cuccarillo, an amazing individual, coming up on the other side of this quick break.
[01:03:53.689 --> 01:03:55.091]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.111 --> 01:03:57.213]  A new world order.
[01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:02.159]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.582]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[01:04:04.802 --> 01:04:07.905]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:04:08.446 --> 01:04:10.849]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:11.608 --> 01:04:19.136]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:26.925]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.425 --> 01:04:30.907]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.287 --> 01:04:33.789]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the World Government.
[01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:35.009]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.770]  They're not after money.
[01:04:35.790 --> 01:04:36.870]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.071 --> 01:04:37.811]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.051 --> 01:04:39.092]  That's what they're after.

[01:05:52.566 --> 01:05:55.509]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:05:55.669 --> 01:06:00.834]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:06:01.194 --> 01:06:06.499]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.

[01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:17.267]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.

[01:07:09.777 --> 01:07:13.861]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:25.464 --> 01:07:28.046]  Lauren Cucurillo is our guest.
[01:07:29.907 --> 01:07:31.788]  Lead guitarist for Duran Duran.
[01:07:31.808 --> 01:07:34.450]  Of course, also with Frank Zappa's band before that.
[01:07:35.091 --> 01:07:37.833]  And he wrote many of the greatest hits of Duran Duran.
[01:07:38.213 --> 01:07:40.695]  I'm a big fan of Duran Duran, as people know.
[01:07:41.435 --> 01:07:44.598]  And then to have this guy be a 9-11 truther in such an articulate one is great.
[01:07:45.258 --> 01:07:50.602]  He also owns some of the hottest restaurants out in California, and now opened one in New York.
[01:07:51.511 --> 01:07:51.952]  I don't know.
[01:08:08.946 --> 01:08:12.987]  Just like our beloved Aaron Russo and Rob Jacobsen who works here in my office.
[01:08:13.007 --> 01:08:14.388]  Just great, great folks from Brooklyn.
[01:08:14.428 --> 01:08:17.309]  I like people from Brooklyn every time I run into them or around them.
[01:08:17.329 --> 01:08:18.969]  We're going to be talking about Benjamin Fulford.
[01:08:19.049 --> 01:08:20.490]  It's funny that Collar just mentioned that.
[01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.351]  That's one of the things Warren wants to talk about.
[01:08:23.071 --> 01:08:24.531]  And also Blackwater.
[01:08:24.571 --> 01:08:25.392]  Warren's got comments.
[01:08:25.492 --> 01:08:34.995]  I haven't talked enough about Blackwater and just the whole Mercenary Society and the fact that New York City a week ago, we just blazed over this, said, yeah, last year they said we're looking at bombs in the buildings.
[01:08:35.275 --> 01:08:37.876]  And then now they come out and say, it was actually earlier this year, and they say,
[01:08:38.958 --> 01:08:41.547]  Yeah, we don't know why 7-1 or 2 fell.
[01:08:41.988 --> 01:08:43.493]  Science doesn't make sense.
[01:08:44.095 --> 01:08:45.039]  We can't explain it.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:47.801]  I mean, you're not going to see that on the History Channel.
[01:08:48.081 --> 01:08:53.544]  You're not going to see that in Popular Mechanics, Yellow Journalism, Hearst Publishing, because they can't deal with it.
[01:08:53.564 --> 01:08:54.585]  They're just going to make stuff up.
[01:08:54.905 --> 01:08:56.946]  Warren, it is great to have you back, my friend!
[01:08:57.146 --> 01:08:58.367]  It's a pleasure to be back.
[01:08:58.807 --> 01:09:01.548]  Let's talk about Popular Mechanics for a second, Alex.
[01:09:01.828 --> 01:09:05.931]  Have you seen Pull It Revisited yet on YouTube?
[01:09:06.171 --> 01:09:07.651]  Yes, it really breaks down their fraud.
[01:09:07.671 --> 01:09:08.552]  Why don't you tell folks about it?
[01:09:09.233 --> 01:09:14.358]  Well, everybody should have a look at this because there's an individual, I think he's Canadian, and he just makes phone calls.
[01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:17.581]  And he's got quite a dry wit, I have to say.
[01:09:18.062 --> 01:09:24.467]  But he calls up every demolition company he can get the numbers of and asks them about the term pullet.
[01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:28.011]  Is that a term that's used in your business to bring down a building?
[01:09:28.631 --> 01:09:30.633]  And he got it from everyone.
[01:09:30.673 --> 01:09:31.914]  And it's all there on YouTube.
[01:09:31.994 --> 01:09:33.376]  It's being pullet revisited.
[01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:36.939]  And you can see everything that the Popular Mechanics guys have said.
[01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:37.319]  You know what?
[01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:38.961]  There's a couple different versions of that.
[01:09:39.061 --> 01:09:49.110]  John, why don't you go find a shorter one that just has the highlights, pullet revisited, and hit view count to see if you can get the top ones.
[01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:50.091]  Because that's the incredible thing.
[01:09:50.391 --> 01:09:53.614]  In the same PBS documentary, when we first broke this, and we did break it,
[01:09:54.114 --> 01:09:58.955]  And by breaking, a listener pointed it out and said, it was just on TV, Silverteen says you blew it, we put it out.
[01:09:59.215 --> 01:10:03.116]  And I had the truth movement saying I was exaggerating and it didn't mean pull it.
[01:10:03.556 --> 01:10:12.939]  And I went, in the next scene in the film, they have the control demolition firm out there blowing up the other buildings months later, going, we're getting ready to blow the building up, pull it!
[01:10:13.259 --> 01:10:17.880]  And then it's a term, I mean... Warren, this is insane, go ahead.
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:19.040]  It's completely insane.
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:20.821]  There's also a clip up there where
[01:10:21.622 --> 01:10:28.432]  Actually shows control demolition ain't taking I think in the Midwest This phone is ring.
[01:10:28.452 --> 01:10:36.223]  I told him to hold my calls Anyway, you can hear this this huge explosion like the same one that was heard by those guys who were on the telephone and
[01:10:36.724 --> 01:10:38.725]  Remember those three cops I think they were?
[01:10:38.745 --> 01:10:42.386]  They were on the phone and somebody wanted to say to his mother that he was okay.
[01:10:42.626 --> 01:10:43.186]  Absolutely!
[01:10:43.526 --> 01:10:45.686]  You hear this huge, huge explosion.
[01:10:46.307 --> 01:10:48.927]  And this footage they showed from Controlled Demolition, Inc.
[01:10:48.987 --> 01:10:53.188]  doing their job in the Midwest somewhere, there is this identical sound.
[01:10:53.228 --> 01:10:59.870]  There is no questioning it's the exact same charges that they used to take the basements out.
[01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:02.311]  And it has to be heard to be believed.
[01:11:02.351 --> 01:11:05.792]  There's nothing more damaging than that.
[01:11:06.372 --> 01:11:06.793]  We're good to go.
[01:11:24.184 --> 01:11:25.866]  I'm going to bring up some more good news here.
[01:11:25.886 --> 01:11:27.008]  I don't watch a lot of television.
[01:11:27.028 --> 01:11:29.291]  I kind of watch it in the aggregate, you know, condensed.
[01:11:29.311 --> 01:11:30.472]  People send me YouTube clips.
[01:11:30.833 --> 01:11:34.698]  So I do watch TV, but I don't sit down, you know, normally and just watch mindless television.
[01:11:35.158 --> 01:11:37.481]  I was at my mother's house yesterday, popping by to say hi.
[01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:38.403]  I hadn't seen her in a few weeks.
[01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:49.580]  And to make a long story short, there is Tucker Carlson on there, the little neocon, who's now rolled over and says he supports Ron Paul and stuff because he sees the writing on the wall.
[01:11:50.421 --> 01:11:58.949]  And he's got a Washington Post writer and their political analyst on, and they say, yeah, a large portion of the public now thinks the government did it.
[01:12:00.090 --> 01:12:00.951]  What are we going to do?
[01:12:01.051 --> 01:12:02.292]  Nobody believes us anymore.
[01:12:02.313 --> 01:12:03.514]  Tucker said this on the air.
[01:12:04.376 --> 01:12:04.776]  Oh, yeah.
[01:12:04.936 --> 01:12:11.220]  And he was basically panicking and bemoaning the fact that the government was totally hated by the entire public.
[01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:13.000]  And, I mean, they were scared.
[01:12:13.021 --> 01:12:14.101]  And I see this more and more.
[01:12:14.141 --> 01:12:21.845]  They're starting to realize, and they're getting desperate, by the way, the debunkers and people, that we're not going to stop and that we actually have woken the people up.
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:32.527]  Yeah, well, in the words of Jordan Maxwell, he says, don't ever forget the people who were paid to lie to you, telling you everything was just fine.
[01:12:32.827 --> 01:12:33.728]  And this is what happened.
[01:12:34.148 --> 01:12:35.830]  Remember their names and their faces.
[01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:42.234]  They're the ones who, you know, need to be to go down in history as the ultimate liars.
[01:12:42.554 --> 01:12:49.039]  People like the late great Peter Jennings, and Dan Rather, and all those other guys.
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:51.281]  They're just paid liars.
[01:12:53.877 --> 01:12:55.278]  So what are we going to do about it?
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:06.289]  I think, personally, I think guys like O'Reilly and all these other people, like Hannity, if they really looked into what would happen on that day, they'd probably be the most vocal.
[01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:09.272]  But they're just too loyal to their paychecks.
[01:13:09.472 --> 01:13:12.895]  They don't want to wind up on another network somewhere.
[01:13:14.815 --> 01:13:16.297]  In the middle of nowhere, you know?
[01:13:16.357 --> 01:13:17.498]  They want to be where they are.
[01:13:17.538 --> 01:13:19.641]  They want their ratings to go up and up and up.
[01:13:20.182 --> 01:13:22.785]  Well, their ratings should be going down and down and down.
[01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:23.306]  They are!
[01:13:23.346 --> 01:13:24.407]  They are starting to plunge.
[01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:30.835]  Well, people need to turn off their television sets because that is the most poisonous tool that they have to use against us.
[01:13:32.654 --> 01:13:39.599]  Well, just to see them panicking and admitting that people are taking over, did you see the footage of the folks taking over Bill Maher's show for five minutes?
[01:13:40.099 --> 01:13:48.405]  Well, I spent most of the evening last night with the New York We Are Change guys, with Luke and John Paul and Danny Padilla, everybody was there, Danny.
[01:13:49.586 --> 01:13:57.471]  And, yeah, well, Bill Maher is on the fast track to having more enemies than Larry Silverstein and Bill O'Reilly combined.
[01:13:57.831 --> 01:13:59.933]  I got a great idea for Bill Maher, actually.
[01:14:00.919 --> 01:14:07.465]  What we should do is, and we've got some already, we've got some supermodel babes hooked up in the movement now, right?
[01:14:07.945 --> 01:14:10.668]  And they're just there to seduce these scums.
[01:14:11.148 --> 01:14:17.093]  And then, who knows, maybe a knockout drop, who knows, maybe some very compromising photos, who knows what we can get out of them.
[01:14:17.534 --> 01:14:26.702]  But Giuliani and Bill Maher and who else, whoever's got that wild penis thing going on where they just gotta get on top of everybody they see, use their power some more,
[01:14:27.614 --> 01:14:30.555]  The next girl they sleep with might be one of ours.
[01:14:31.455 --> 01:14:32.636]  So remember that, guys.
[01:14:33.176 --> 01:14:37.177]  The next girl you sleep with might just be able to get all the dirt on you we need.
[01:14:37.477 --> 01:14:42.779]  You know, Warren, I have never, you know, I mean, that's taken the gloves off big time.
[01:14:43.759 --> 01:14:49.801]  But the point is that it's getting to that point in special ops, in the military, police.
[01:14:50.421 --> 01:14:52.982]  I mean, I was there at the 9-11 symposium we had in L.A.
[01:14:53.022 --> 01:14:53.462]  last year.
[01:14:54.082 --> 01:15:02.601]  And there was Charlie Sheen's bodyguard, who's an LAPD detective off-duty, and there were these other cops there, and he said, look, everybody on the force knows it's an inside job.
[01:15:02.882 --> 01:15:03.984]  And then I... Why is there no strikes?
[01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:16.401]  Well, I was expanding on this, and then, when they showed up, and the security guards had arrested one of the people from We Are Change, the cops said, take them out of those handcuffs, they're allowed to heckle, and let them go.
[01:15:16.461 --> 01:15:28.708]  But the point is, is that it's really starting to happen, and I had cops outside, who were there, guarding the hotel, coming up and shaking my hand, in uniform, in Los Angeles.
[01:15:28.768 --> 01:15:32.490]  They are not, so, I mean, something amazing is happening here.
[01:15:33.451 --> 01:15:46.765]  Well, thanks to you and everyone else in the movement, people like Tarpley and Maxwell and David Icke, all these guys, man, you're so ahead of the curve and I don't know how you guys were so out of the darkness.
[01:15:47.867 --> 01:15:49.528]  It's amazing that you've actually
[01:15:50.269 --> 01:15:50.750]  We're good to go.
[01:16:19.171 --> 01:16:26.355]  Different people who have data that needs to be processed, and it doesn't come out in the American press, so more and more people know that now.
[01:16:26.555 --> 01:16:30.897]  Also, the average person, they've made education not classical anymore in the last 50 years, 60 years.
[01:16:31.137 --> 01:16:33.379]  They've made it so dry and boring, nobody gets into it.
[01:16:33.759 --> 01:16:38.702]  It's fun to randomly see what some executive that Bush is meeting with's history is.
[01:16:39.142 --> 01:16:41.263]  It's fun to learn factoids.
[01:16:41.343 --> 01:16:45.045]  I mean, it's so addictive to really turn your brain on, Warren.
[01:16:45.645 --> 01:17:06.839]  Yeah, I mean, you know, hopefully within a few months, many, many people will know what Freemasonry is, and they'll know what Skull and Bones is, and Cap and Gown, and they'll understand that if we're going to elect someone, well, we know there's a selection process going on now, but if we get back to electing people, they should not be affiliated with these organizations in any way, shape, or form.
[01:17:07.299 --> 01:17:11.682]  You know, their level of secrecy right now is like around the level of the bad ventriloquist, you know?
[01:17:12.442 --> 01:17:13.563]  It's not secret anymore.
[01:17:15.066 --> 01:17:20.494]  So, you know, we just, we're gonna do a background check on a guy who wants to, you know, work for a cable company?
[01:17:20.534 --> 01:17:21.655]  What about our politicians?
[01:17:22.546 --> 01:17:25.870]  Well, you know, they exempt themselves from Social Security.
[01:17:26.250 --> 01:17:29.914]  They exempt themselves from hundreds, and I mean hundreds, of their own laws.
[01:17:29.934 --> 01:17:34.579]  I don't think the average person out there realizes just how criminal these people are.
[01:17:34.939 --> 01:17:36.120]  Yeah, they can't accept it.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.843]  They don't want to know, you know, Santa Claus Syndrome and all that.
[01:17:38.963 --> 01:17:40.565]  You know, it could never happen.
[01:17:40.585 --> 01:17:41.566]  It's our government.
[01:17:42.307 --> 01:17:44.149]  You know, look at him smiling with his family.
[01:17:44.489 --> 01:17:45.050]  Come on!
[01:17:46.138 --> 01:17:47.279]  It goes way beyond that.
[01:17:47.339 --> 01:17:49.641]  These guys have alternate agendas.
[01:17:49.982 --> 01:17:52.104]  They have foreign allegiance.
[01:17:52.184 --> 01:17:54.606]  They're not loyal to the United States of America.
[01:17:54.706 --> 01:17:57.229]  Well, what was the term, the equation?
[01:17:57.269 --> 01:18:01.153]  It was, you said, power and secrecy, or trust and secrecy?
[01:18:01.213 --> 01:18:02.394]  Secrets and authority.
[01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:04.428]  Secrets and authority.
[01:18:04.468 --> 01:18:05.909]  Just, you know, the Catholic priesthood.
[01:18:06.269 --> 01:18:07.029]  We know all about it.
[01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:17.511]  If it was not investigated, our hearts and souls and our brains would never... We wouldn't even want to go there because... And now the full magnitude can't even be believed because it's so big.
[01:18:18.352 --> 01:18:24.473]  Yeah, well, when we're talking about, first of all, 9-11 was their biggest broad daylight blunder ever.
[01:18:25.487 --> 01:18:26.648]  There's way too much footage.
[01:18:26.668 --> 01:18:28.290]  There's not one Zapruder film.
[01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:33.195]  We've got lots of footage, and we've got lots of experts, and they're tearing it apart.
[01:18:33.835 --> 01:18:35.117]  The myth is gone.
[01:18:36.298 --> 01:18:44.986]  And by the way, folks, NIFS, the federal government, says that science can't explain why all the buildings fell, unless there were boom-booms in the buildings.
[01:18:45.046 --> 01:18:46.948]  And there were big boom-booms.
[01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.831]  We're going to come back and talk about Benjamin Holford and a lot more.
[01:18:53.286 --> 01:18:56.927]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:18:57.207 --> 01:19:00.748]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.

[01:19:53.698 --> 01:19:56.079]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.081]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:19:58.421 --> 01:20:02.263]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:20:02.683 --> 01:20:04.885]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:20:05.325 --> 01:20:08.647]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:20:09.047 --> 01:20:11.529]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:20:12.029 --> 01:20:13.089]  What's that name again?
[01:20:13.470 --> 01:20:14.650]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:16.191]  It's CalX.
[01:20:16.612 --> 01:20:18.453]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:20:18.793 --> 01:20:20.634]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:20:21.408 --> 01:20:30.034]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:20:30.475 --> 01:20:36.179]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing CalX ointment.
[01:20:36.579 --> 01:20:47.707]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Phyllo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:20:48.354 --> 01:20:49.454]  Hey, here's the drugstore.
[01:20:49.794 --> 01:20:50.455]  I'll be right back.
[01:20:50.595 --> 01:20:52.335]  I'm getting some callots for my heels.
[01:20:53.555 --> 01:20:59.037]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:20:59.477 --> 01:21:03.698]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:21:04.118 --> 01:21:10.980]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:21:11.420 --> 01:21:18.125]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:21:18.445 --> 01:21:20.066]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:21:20.366 --> 01:21:23.548]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:21:23.829 --> 01:21:26.270]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:21:26.591 --> 01:21:27.731]  BioSolutions has over 550
[01:21:28.792 --> 01:21:29.313]  We're good to go.
[01:21:53.459 --> 01:21:54.941]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond.

[01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:36.015]  Well, maybe once we meet, give me a sign In case my breathing even grows to be high Yes, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you do, you
[01:23:36.542 --> 01:23:45.424]  Warren Cuccarillo, he wrote many of the songs for Duran Duran, also their lead guitarist, and he came all the way out to New York
[01:23:46.493 --> 01:23:47.033]  We're good to go.
[01:24:16.844 --> 01:24:18.085]  He was formerly with Forbes.
[01:24:18.105 --> 01:24:18.725]  He wasn't fired.
[01:24:18.765 --> 01:24:20.647]  He quit, saying Forbes wouldn't let him print it.
[01:24:21.427 --> 01:24:28.873]  Now he's been assigned for many years in Japan, and he said that the Asians have learned about a plan to exterminate the majority of them.
[01:24:28.893 --> 01:24:31.515]  Well, that's in Jane's Weapons Quarterly that they have these weapons.
[01:24:32.256 --> 01:24:37.480]  And the Chinese said they want to use them, so I mean, who knows what the Chinese mafia knows.
[01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.248]  Uh, and that they don't want to die.
[01:24:40.608 --> 01:24:42.829]  See, I mean, this Endgame stuff's big, okay?
[01:24:42.869 --> 01:24:43.970]  I mean, this is the big issue.
[01:24:44.230 --> 01:24:54.916]  You may, it may not be big on, you know, television or with, uh, you know, people like Pat Robertson or, or liberals, conservatives, doesn't matter, but it's big in the real world, and that's what Endgame's all about.
[01:24:55.296 --> 01:24:57.077]  So I'm glad, suddenly, this is all a huge issue.
[01:24:57.097 --> 01:24:59.038]  I mean, it's, it's all over television, not just Fulford.
[01:24:59.318 --> 01:25:07.443]  I mean, they're talking about how the, but saying it's good in the media that we all need to die, and this is, Warren, this is some crazy stuff, uh, but it, unfortunately, proved to be stranger than fiction.
[01:25:07.463 --> 01:25:08.043]  What do you think of it?
[01:25:08.383 --> 01:25:16.474]  Well, everyone in the truth movement knows that truth is definitely stranger than fiction, and that's something we never wanted to admit because we are trusting, loving individuals.
[01:25:16.994 --> 01:25:19.317]  But this Fulford guy is very interesting.
[01:25:19.778 --> 01:25:24.183]  His lineage is very impressive, actually.
[01:25:24.244 --> 01:25:25.906]  His great-grandfather,
[01:25:26.466 --> 01:25:28.126]  Was a man named G.T.
[01:25:28.367 --> 01:25:31.307]  Fulford, who was at the time one of the richest men in the world.
[01:25:31.347 --> 01:25:34.948]  He was the largest individual shareholder of GE.
[01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:39.709]  At this time, he was funding Nikola Tesla.
[01:25:40.789 --> 01:25:47.851]  And throughout his dealings with Tesla, all of a sudden, G.T.
[01:25:47.891 --> 01:25:49.551]  Fulford is suicided.
[01:25:49.831 --> 01:25:52.192]  Not suicided, he's in a car accident.
[01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:55.313]  It's like something out of the Clinton Chronicles, you know?
[01:25:56.254 --> 01:25:58.998]  Exactly.
[01:25:59.619 --> 01:26:06.928]  Benjamin's grandfather at the time was only three, and the family knew that it was a Rockefeller thing.
[01:26:06.988 --> 01:26:08.570]  They knew the Rockefellers were behind it.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:15.142]  By the way, folks, the Rockefellers were known as pure evil at the time, all over, everywhere.
[01:26:15.402 --> 01:26:19.624]  I mean, they would go into encampments of miners and machine gun hundreds.
[01:26:19.724 --> 01:26:22.466]  I mean, just check into Rockefeller massacres.
[01:26:22.506 --> 01:26:23.446]  Type that into Google.
[01:26:23.766 --> 01:26:26.408]  Colorado, Wyoming, Texas.
[01:26:26.848 --> 01:26:29.709]  I mean, they would send in mercenaries and just exterminate everybody.
[01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:31.130]  So that's why they were so well-known.
[01:26:31.150 --> 01:26:33.752]  They would just kill their business rivals, hunt them down.
[01:26:33.812 --> 01:26:34.672]  And this was all over.
[01:26:34.732 --> 01:26:36.113]  And they just said, there's nothing you can do.
[01:26:36.193 --> 01:26:36.453]  Go ahead.
[01:26:36.913 --> 01:26:40.175]  So his grandfather, like his great-grandfather was G.T.
[01:26:40.215 --> 01:26:43.878]  Fulford, his grandfather was only three at the time of G.T.
[01:26:43.918 --> 01:26:50.422]  Fulford's death, and as it turns out, the Rockefellers managed to swindle the entire fortune.
[01:26:51.463 --> 01:26:55.105]  So I don't know the details of that, he got into it briefly, but there was, you know,
[01:27:00.191 --> 01:27:02.294]  Well, they ended up getting Henry Ford's cash.
[01:27:02.935 --> 01:27:03.496]  Well, there you go.
[01:27:03.556 --> 01:27:07.402]  See, I don't know all this stuff, but I'm just listening to Benjamin, so he's got this background.
[01:27:08.081 --> 01:27:12.002]  And it's almost like divine justice, you know, that's what's happening right now.
[01:27:12.342 --> 01:27:13.983]  Now, let's shoot to where we're at.
[01:27:14.363 --> 01:27:18.844]  This guy is a finance man, and he's also an investigative journalist.
[01:27:18.884 --> 01:27:27.606]  Like you said, he was working for Forbes for eight years, and he quit because, I mean, he was given quite a lot of leeway, a lot more than you would get in the United States as an investigative journalist in these days.
[01:27:28.106 --> 01:27:31.227]  And he, you know, since he's a finance man, he was following the money.
[01:27:31.247 --> 01:27:35.468]  And as we all know, when you follow the money trail, you're going to find out what's going on.
[01:27:36.248 --> 01:27:37.269]  Yeah, it's great to be here.
[01:27:58.456 --> 01:28:01.097]  Yeah, the Sony stands for Standard Oil New York.
[01:28:26.722 --> 01:28:27.422]  It really does.
[01:28:27.442 --> 01:28:29.643]  Stay there, stay there.
[01:28:29.683 --> 01:28:31.965]  Oh yeah, the Rockefellers really own Mishi Bishi, all of it.
[01:28:32.265 --> 01:28:34.386]  In fact, I mean, we have the documents on that, I'm not just saying it.
[01:28:34.646 --> 01:28:40.609]  And they didn't get all the Ford fortune, they were able to get control of the Ford Foundation, which is 24 Bill today.
[01:28:43.350 --> 01:28:46.351]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.252 --> 01:28:49.953]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.901]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:28:58.281 --> 01:29:01.242]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:29:01.542 --> 01:29:04.103]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:29:04.483 --> 01:29:09.284]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:29:09.685 --> 01:29:15.046]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:29:15.346 --> 01:29:18.307]  In 2005, President Bush signed the Real ID Act.
[01:29:18.507 --> 01:29:19.067]  We're good to go.
[01:29:41.898 --> 01:29:42.138]  We're good.
[01:29:53.544 --> 01:29:57.808]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:29:58.068 --> 01:30:02.973]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:03.173 --> 01:30:04.494]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:30:04.674 --> 01:30:08.017]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:31:14.919 --> 01:31:18.601]  Gravity does the work with the SacroWegi under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[01:31:18.781 --> 01:31:20.843]  Help correct posture to help relieve the pain.
[01:31:23.067 --> 01:31:26.070]  You can even sit on the Sacrowegi at the computer or while traveling.
[01:31:26.250 --> 01:31:30.673]  This device has been helping people for the past 15 years, yet the cost is still just $29.95.

[01:31:56.989 --> 01:32:00.856]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:07.971 --> 01:32:16.593]  Coming up in one hour, we've got Ron Paul's media head, good ol' Jesse Benton joining us.
[01:32:16.613 --> 01:32:19.034]  Let's talk about Ron Paul, now admittedly a first-tier candidate.
[01:32:19.054 --> 01:32:19.674]  Can you believe it?
[01:32:20.034 --> 01:32:24.075]  He went from could-never-win-ha-ha-ha to a first-tier candidate.
[01:32:24.275 --> 01:32:25.556]  You did it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:25.636 --> 01:32:28.396]  You did it, as Ron Paul said here, and I'm very proud of it.
[01:32:28.436 --> 01:32:29.457]  I'm not bragging.
[01:32:29.497 --> 01:32:30.297]  I'm bragging on you.
[01:32:31.340 --> 01:32:48.376]  Ron Paul said, without prompting, a few months ago, he said, we get the biggest response from your show, and he went on to say that the majority of people that come up to him across the country, and this was two months ago, it's probably going to shift as he gets even more and more, say, I heard about you on Alex Jones.
[01:32:48.416 --> 01:32:52.260]  I mean, that makes me realize, man, I better do a good job.
[01:32:53.621 --> 01:32:55.323]  I mean, the millions of listeners we have now.
[01:32:55.922 --> 01:32:58.603]  I better really do my research.
[01:32:58.783 --> 01:32:59.844]  It's a great responsibility.
[01:33:00.124 --> 01:33:01.584]  But I want to just state, I'm not perfect.
[01:33:01.624 --> 01:33:02.444]  I'm an average guy.
[01:33:03.785 --> 01:33:06.606]  Heavy is the crown, you know, doing something like this.
[01:33:06.766 --> 01:33:08.667]  And I want you to know that I believe in you.
[01:33:08.967 --> 01:33:10.627]  You're smarter than I am in most cases.
[01:33:10.948 --> 01:33:11.788]  Go be your own leaders.
[01:33:12.307 --> 01:33:13.688]  I mean, look at Warren Cuccarillo.
[01:33:13.788 --> 01:33:18.611]  So intelligent, so accomplished in so many other fields, and he's now fighting hardcore.
[01:33:19.432 --> 01:33:22.854]  He's always been involved in important issues, but really hardcore for the Truth Movement.
[01:33:23.254 --> 01:33:24.235]  We're so honored to have him.
[01:33:24.435 --> 01:33:28.278]  Before we go back to Warren Cuccarillo, I want to tell you that you need to visit InfoWars.com.
[01:33:28.298 --> 01:33:31.300]  We've got a link to his MySpace page right up there.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:33.501]  He'd like to meet you, talk to you there.
[01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:35.743]  He says he's met a lot of great people coming on this show and other shows.
[01:33:36.183 --> 01:33:37.364]  So again, we're very thankful for that.
[01:33:37.744 --> 01:33:39.225]  And I also want to just tell the listeners,
[01:33:41.212 --> 01:33:43.335]  In game is less than three days away.
[01:33:44.216 --> 01:33:45.879]  Thursday night at midnight.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.140]  Who knows?
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:49.303]  It might even pop up a little bit earlier, but we'll see.
[01:33:49.944 --> 01:33:50.986]  Thursday night.
[01:33:51.758 --> 01:34:04.784]  At midnight, it's going to be up there in three super high-quality flash formats, two QuickTimes, two Windows files, and they're super high-quality and they're perfect to get on disk to give to people for educational, non-profit purposes.
[01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:11.388]  The InfoWars starts, a new salvo, a new major offensive starts October 26th.
[01:34:11.948 --> 01:34:14.049]  It's October 23rd, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:34:14.855 --> 01:34:16.777]  I mean, there's only one more full day.
[01:34:16.897 --> 01:34:17.578]  That's tomorrow.
[01:34:17.778 --> 01:34:19.119]  Part of this day, part of Thursday.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:25.426]  Only one more full day until this is up on the web for members.
[01:34:26.987 --> 01:34:29.770]  PrisonPlanet.tv and it's 15 cents a day for members.
[01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:31.792]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:34:32.404 --> 01:34:36.227]  We've got a really nice counter distribution network and other distribution network.
[01:34:36.267 --> 01:34:39.349]  That means it's downloading it faster than T1 speeds.
[01:34:39.729 --> 01:34:43.712]  Now if your connection isn't good it won't, but I mean it'll come down slow, but most people it's really fast.
[01:34:43.912 --> 01:34:45.093]  It's just so beautiful now.
[01:34:45.433 --> 01:34:46.834]  And this is almost DVD quality.
[01:34:46.854 --> 01:34:48.355]  I don't watch it.
[01:34:48.395 --> 01:34:49.816]  The web's going to put us out of business soon.
[01:34:49.836 --> 01:34:55.399]  Everybody rips it seven ways to Sunday and there's no reason to even get the DVD in the future, but the DVD for now does look better than the web.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:57.621]  Then you get the nice case and it supports us.
[01:34:58.602 --> 01:35:02.486]  Get the DVD at Infowars.com and it will be shipping Monday.
[01:35:02.646 --> 01:35:03.687]  We're packaging them all up.
[01:35:03.707 --> 01:35:04.688]  They start shipping Monday.
[01:35:05.949 --> 01:35:08.492]  So if you order today, your stuff's going to be shipped out on Monday.
[01:35:09.373 --> 01:35:11.675]  And again, the endgame blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:35:11.695 --> 01:35:15.258]  We've got deals where you can get 10 of them and they're like $10 a piece.
[01:35:15.699 --> 01:35:16.740]  That's half off.
[01:35:17.506 --> 01:35:20.187]  And I just want to move a bunch of these and get them out to people.
[01:35:20.687 --> 01:35:22.227]  This needs to be a hit.
[01:35:22.648 --> 01:35:24.108]  And that's why I've been promoting it so much.
[01:35:24.148 --> 01:35:27.889]  So PrisonPlanet.tv or call toll free to order the DVD at 888-253-3139.
[01:35:27.909 --> 01:35:28.089]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:29.630]  Or you can write to me.
[01:35:29.690 --> 01:35:32.070]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:35:45.938 --> 01:35:48.979]  Or order the DVDs via InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:35:48.999 --> 01:35:56.561]  Warren, thank you for holding during that obnoxious plug for the endgame, but why don't you plug your MySpace?
[01:35:56.581 --> 01:35:57.882]  This is a great MySpace, I've seen it.
[01:35:58.222 --> 01:36:03.684]  I just think, you know, I love being in contact with people in the movement, and my MySpace page is the best place to do it.
[01:36:03.724 --> 01:36:06.524]  It's just MySpace.com slash Warren Cucurula.
[01:36:08.605 --> 01:36:15.067]  Everybody around the world is starting to find out what the ultimate reality checkpoint is, Alex, and that's InfoWars.com.
[01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:18.800]  So, let's get back to Benjamin Fulford for a second.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:19.700]  Absolutely!
[01:36:19.980 --> 01:36:41.546]  This last book that he put out that he was in fear for his life over was dealing heavily into the SARS issue, the bird flu virus, and he found out a lot of information and was convinced that this was a an attempt to take out hundreds of thousands of Asians.
[01:36:41.626 --> 01:36:45.187]  This was a biospecific pathogen
[01:36:46.443 --> 01:36:58.666]  And it was engineered... Now, by the way, that had already come out in some mainstream papers around the world, with scientists saying that it looked like that, and that it wasn't meant... You know, 100,000 sounds like a lot, but that was only a test to see how it would spread.
[01:36:58.686 --> 01:37:01.927]  It was a lower-grade model of something more horrible to come.
[01:37:02.067 --> 01:37:02.387]  Go ahead.
[01:37:02.627 --> 01:37:14.170]  Well, we all know on page 60 of the PNAC document, there's a reference to developing biospecific germs and stuff, you know, so that's an ugly thing, so...
[01:37:15.231 --> 01:37:29.644]  When the Chinese Secret Society got a hold of him, first of all, he got approached by a Freemason, high-ranking Freemason, came to him and offered him the job of Minister of Finance of Japan for death.
[01:37:31.046 --> 01:37:36.651]  The next day, he gets a call from someone who says he's in a Chinese secret society.
[01:37:37.111 --> 01:37:50.362]  He meets the guy, he still doesn't know if he's for real or not, and the second meeting he had he knew it was for real because the people that he was at the meeting with were, you know, either heavy gangsters or people that he saw in the papers every day.
[01:37:50.802 --> 01:37:57.067]  So he's talking about people as high up as the Politburo level in the Chinese government.
[01:37:57.939 --> 01:38:03.128]  And these guys came to him because they are, and as they should be, just like we are all angry.
[01:38:03.269 --> 01:38:05.072]  More angry than Peter Finch and Network.
[01:38:05.733 --> 01:38:05.853]  He...
[01:38:06.878 --> 01:38:16.447]  These guys are very concerned that their race is one of the ones that is being targeted with genome-specific pathogens to take them out.
[01:38:16.807 --> 01:38:24.714]  Now, if I was Chinese or Indian or, you know, in a country that has a lot of people, I would be very, very concerned.
[01:38:24.734 --> 01:38:33.602]  So here comes this society that's been around for a while, just like the other secret societies in the West, and these guys are
[01:38:35.345 --> 01:38:37.487]  They're not playing around, okay?
[01:38:37.527 --> 01:38:44.454]  We're talking about six million members with a hundred thousand assassins.
[01:38:45.194 --> 01:38:56.665]  So the deal they put on the table to the Illuminati, let's call them, was, um, and this ties in with something else that I found out about two, three months ago through a peace movement.
[01:38:57.406 --> 01:39:00.389]  I was told that the neocons are
[01:39:01.314 --> 01:39:07.057]  They know the jig is up, and they want to just fade off away into the background.
[01:39:07.418 --> 01:39:09.539]  And I'm saying, unacceptable!
[01:39:09.899 --> 01:39:11.560]  There must be full accountability!
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:18.324]  Then I found out who was funding these guys, this peace organization, and it was the Rothschilds, and I tore them a new A-hole over that.
[01:39:18.844 --> 01:39:25.488]  But, Fulford, in his interview, mentions a serious split between the Rothschilds
[01:39:26.303 --> 01:39:28.424]  And the Rockefellers in Europe.
[01:39:28.464 --> 01:39:31.086]  That's why Iraq's not going exactly the way they wanted it to go.
[01:39:31.826 --> 01:39:37.069]  And he said that's why we're seeing a lot of this, what we call... By the way, that's stuff that we've all reported.
[01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:41.691]  We reported about how the neocons through the back doors are funding the peace movements.
[01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:43.272]  We reported something that's accurate.
[01:39:43.592 --> 01:39:47.395]  We reported years ago that there was a Bilderberg Group split.
[01:39:47.675 --> 01:39:49.756]  Jim Tucker, for five years, has been reporting that.
[01:39:49.776 --> 01:39:51.597]  This is before the war, actually about six now.
[01:39:52.337 --> 01:39:56.781]  And so a lot of that information is, you know, what he's repeating, is checking out.
[01:39:56.801 --> 01:39:57.122]  Go ahead.
[01:39:57.142 --> 01:40:02.186]  So that would be people with no morals versus people with some morals, maybe, okay?
[01:40:02.266 --> 01:40:08.432]  Or, well, or elites that think the neocon plan is too accelerated and endangers the apple cart.
[01:40:09.139 --> 01:40:14.723]  Yeah, so the other side is just going full hog on the global warming thing and the global tax and all that.
[01:40:15.064 --> 01:40:30.575]  But anyway, so here he is with these guys and they put this proposal down which I thought was, you know, if you read it, it's kind of depressing in a way because the first line is, you can keep your mansions and your servants, okay?
[01:40:30.956 --> 01:40:34.879]  Because I think all of them, all their assets should be seized and they should be hung.
[01:40:35.559 --> 01:40:38.620]  You know, and this should have been going on since the early 1900s.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:44.042]  You know, like the Morgans and whoever, the Astors, anybody who was like caught out.
[01:40:44.082 --> 01:40:47.583]  But we know our justice system doesn't prosecute these people because it's owned.
[01:40:48.243 --> 01:40:50.384]  So we have a big problem with the Department of Justice.
[01:40:50.444 --> 01:40:59.686]  We know there's like limited justice or no justice for the majority of people and the elites are, you know, they just have a free pass.
[01:41:00.467 --> 01:41:00.907]  But anyway,
[01:41:02.313 --> 01:41:11.799]  The alternative to their, like, five-point kind of peacemaking plan between the two secret societies is death.
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:25.248]  And they're starting at the top of the pyramid in this hypothetical situation where they wouldn't be willing to talk and sort it all out, you know, peacefully.
[01:41:26.108 --> 01:41:28.290]  They said they're just going to start at the top of the pyramid
[01:41:29.139 --> 01:41:35.243]  And start killing individuals like David Rockefeller, and they're looking for all the male descendants of all these families.
[01:41:35.743 --> 01:41:38.065]  And they say there's probably about 10,000 of them.
[01:41:38.445 --> 01:41:42.007]  So we have 100,000 assassins, that's 10 assassins per each.
[01:41:44.389 --> 01:41:45.910]  And he said, this is not a threat.
[01:41:46.350 --> 01:41:47.271]  It's a promise.
[01:41:48.131 --> 01:41:53.335]  If we don't sit down and talk and work this out and save lives, where no one dies,
[01:41:54.648 --> 01:41:59.214]  I've never talked about this on air, but I've been contacted back six years ago by different Japanese folks.
[01:42:10.229 --> 01:42:10.690]  We're good to go.
[01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.750]  We're good to go.
[01:42:59.791 --> 01:43:03.134]  Endgame news on whatistheendgame.com, endgamethemovie.com.
[01:43:03.434 --> 01:43:11.179]  We've got a section with, as this news comes out, where suddenly it's coming out in the media that, hey, you know, the head of the genome is basically a Nazi.
[01:43:11.479 --> 01:43:13.260]  Hey, you know, there's plans to use race weapons.
[01:43:13.561 --> 01:43:15.702]  Hey, this book calls for killing everybody.
[01:43:16.022 --> 01:43:18.104]  Hey, and it's both pro and negative.
[01:43:18.124 --> 01:43:22.767]  It's like, it's suddenly all coming out, and I don't just think that's by accident.
[01:43:23.568 --> 01:43:25.649]  I have to ask myself, what's going on?
[01:43:25.689 --> 01:43:27.030]  What do you think's happening right now?
[01:43:27.930 --> 01:43:32.275]  Well, we know it's about death and ultimate control, so yes.
[01:43:33.516 --> 01:43:38.782]  I just don't understand why these stories aren't pounded in the media, you know, like front page, because this is genocide.
[01:43:39.042 --> 01:43:49.694]  Well, the race-specific weapon against the Arabs and Central Asians, they all have the same gene type, you know, the same variety of Homo sapiens sapiens, they're Asians.
[01:43:50.514 --> 01:43:51.694]  Native Americans are Asians.
[01:43:51.714 --> 01:43:53.475]  They have the Mongolian spots on their backs.
[01:43:53.515 --> 01:43:56.476]  They came across the Siberian land bridge there.
[01:43:57.076 --> 01:43:58.216]  I mean, they've done the DNA.
[01:43:58.236 --> 01:43:59.856]  They are Asians.
[01:43:59.876 --> 01:44:02.257]  That's why you go down to southern Mexico where they're really pure natives.
[01:44:02.277 --> 01:44:03.297]  They've got slant eyes.
[01:44:03.597 --> 01:44:04.138]  It's Asians.
[01:44:04.758 --> 01:44:17.341]  And it's been Jane's Weapons Quarterly, the biggest weapons publication in the world that all governments use, says, they put out an alert six years ago warning that race-specific bioweapons have been made by South Africa, Israel, the U.S., and others.
[01:44:18.041 --> 01:44:27.835]  And now they're all being passed around, and so I really don't doubt that Asian leadership is really worried, because they better be worried, folks.
[01:44:28.135 --> 01:44:29.917]  They better be very worried.
[01:44:30.158 --> 01:44:31.600]  Just like the American people should be.
[01:44:33.639 --> 01:44:42.928]  Later on in the interview, Fulford calls out to Rupert Murdoch and says, Rupert, you've got a lot of Asian ties, deep Asian ties.
[01:44:42.968 --> 01:44:46.452]  He named two people, one I think in the Japanese cabinet and the other in the Chinese.
[01:44:46.952 --> 01:44:49.715]  He said to find out these details and you'll know what I'm saying is true.
[01:44:51.935 --> 01:45:00.920]  No, I mean he's naming the people, and I mean regardless, and I believe Fulford believes what he's saying, I believe he was contacted by groups, I believe that these groups do exist.
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:06.363]  I don't know if they're as powerful as they say, but I know they're quite large, and I know they basically run Japan and China.
[01:45:07.084 --> 01:45:10.906]  The big issue that I don't hear Fulford discuss, I've only heard two of the shows and read some of it.
[01:45:11.647 --> 01:45:12.248]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:45:26.138 --> 01:45:31.562]  My big concern is, in 1972, they had secret delegations with Kissinger, Bush Sr.
[01:45:31.582 --> 01:45:43.250]  and others go to China, this is all declassified public now, and this is an endgame, and they went to China and they said, we'll give you IMF World Bank loans, we'll build you up, we'll make you the industrial giant, we'll empower your leadership,
[01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:45.551]  You've just got to put in a one-child policy.
[01:45:45.611 --> 01:45:46.471]  Here's how we want it.
[01:45:46.771 --> 01:45:53.974]  And the Rockefeller Population Fund, publicly, wrote the plan for China, and the Communist Chinese adopted it.
[01:45:53.994 --> 01:45:56.895]  And we know the Communist system was financed by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers.
[01:45:57.355 --> 01:46:01.676]  So my question is, we know the Chinese leadership sold out of the New World Order.
[01:46:02.197 --> 01:46:05.978]  And I know the Chinese leadership of the inner party is intertwined with the mafia.
[01:46:06.438 --> 01:46:11.500]  And so that's where I have a problem here, is that the Chinese leadership
[01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:12.920]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:46:33.245 --> 01:46:36.766]  Because that's my problem with the story, and that's my only problem with it.
[01:46:36.906 --> 01:46:38.226]  Because I already know it's all true.
[01:46:38.446 --> 01:46:42.567]  I can put Endgame out and prove how they're planning it with their own documents, and then it isn't.
[01:46:42.627 --> 01:46:43.128]  Trust me.
[01:46:43.748 --> 01:46:44.428]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:46:44.688 --> 01:46:45.208]  Yeah, I do.
[01:46:45.268 --> 01:46:52.590]  But he did say that these secret societies, they did fight against the communists with Cenk Aşık, and they lost.
[01:46:54.988 --> 01:46:59.077]  Sure, sure, but I mean my question is, so what's happening, so maybe I missed that then.
[01:46:59.317 --> 01:47:02.223]  So they certainly do, well that's a great answer, we need to do an article on that.
[01:47:02.564 --> 01:47:05.030]  So he's saying that they are aware that the communists are controlled.
[01:47:05.675 --> 01:47:31.848]  Yes, and he said, he also said that these guys, because they're dangerous and they're scary, the secret society people, but he said their bottom line is they don't want death, you know, they kind of have some things that you can actually get behind, you know, they actually seem to have some kind of moral code, which is, you know, very encouraging, even though they are dangerous individuals who, you know, they'll stop at nothing, just like the other side would, but they have seem to have a much stronger moral backbone.
[01:47:33.599 --> 01:47:39.921]  And they need to be concerned because, like I said, India and China, and forget about the Middle East.
[01:47:40.001 --> 01:47:41.561]  I mean, you know, we're already killing them.
[01:47:41.601 --> 01:47:43.262]  It's insanity, these racist wars.
[01:47:43.322 --> 01:47:46.683]  But, you know, we should be using our technology to save lives.
[01:47:46.743 --> 01:47:55.005]  If we can make general, specific things that can help groups of people, you know, and help them avoid diseases that they might be susceptible to, you know.
[01:47:55.385 --> 01:47:56.566]  Well, you know what's happening.
[01:47:56.766 --> 01:48:07.416]  I mean, they test these on little orphans, and they test them on people in institutions, and then pass on the developments they get to the elite for use, and then the public doesn't get it.
[01:48:09.258 --> 01:48:20.749]  Yeah, well, you know, whatever's going on there right now behind the scenes, like everything's going on behind the scenes anyway, the things that are happening in Europe and America are all behind the scenes, and very little people, very few people are aware of it.
[01:48:21.708 --> 01:48:25.670]  Now we see that there is an opposing force that's also behind the scenes.
[01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:30.612]  Now, we don't know if it's going to be sorted out that way, so nothing should stop on our front.
[01:48:30.692 --> 01:48:38.795]  You know, everybody needs to be doing, you know, we need to be harassing Bill Maher and all those guys every day until this thing is over.
[01:48:39.075 --> 01:48:39.896]  Well, I know this.
[01:48:39.996 --> 01:48:47.919]  The establishment's getting scared, and up on PrisonPlanet.com, Paul Watson just put this out, it's 80 plus percent now in his own poll
[01:48:48.819 --> 01:49:00.493]  Uh, with Glenn Beck, that little fake neocon on CNN, in his own poll saying that we're not crazy thinking 9-11 is an inside job, but in there he's saying on the TV show, are we like McVeigh?
[01:49:00.614 --> 01:49:01.374]  Are we terrorists?
[01:49:01.735 --> 01:49:02.996]  Get it straight, punk!
[01:49:03.237 --> 01:49:04.899]  We're the ones exposing the...
[01:49:05.459 --> 01:49:11.760]  McVeigh, that that was an inside job, and now that's in mainstream newspapers coming out in FBI documents.
[01:49:12.120 --> 01:49:16.161]  Okay, and that the Southern Poverty Law Center was running the Nazi camp in Elohim City.
[01:49:16.461 --> 01:49:17.441]  Jigs up, buddy!
[01:49:17.761 --> 01:49:21.522]  Don't you dare try to say 9-11 truths behind terrorism!
[01:49:21.702 --> 01:49:22.862]  Boy, that's not gonna work!
[01:49:23.562 --> 01:49:24.502]  Yeah, we're like McVeigh.
[01:49:24.542 --> 01:49:26.803]  The only thing we blow up is myths.
[01:49:27.863 --> 01:49:28.243]  I love it.
[01:49:28.283 --> 01:49:28.883]  I'm stealing it.
[01:49:30.023 --> 01:49:32.604]  Oh my gosh, Warren, that is another gold nugget right there.
[01:49:32.664 --> 01:49:34.344]  And we have no FBI funding!
[01:49:36.242 --> 01:49:39.064]  He just laid a major golden egg.
[01:49:39.084 --> 01:49:41.906]  The only thing the truth of it blows up is myths.
[01:49:42.186 --> 01:49:43.146]  I'm expropriating it.
[01:49:43.166 --> 01:49:52.552]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.992 --> 01:49:56.674]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:49:57.574 --> 01:49:59.916]  Earth is dominated by our power.
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:02.822]  It's known as the Bilderberg Effect.
[01:50:03.463 --> 01:50:05.684]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:06.245 --> 01:50:08.707]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:09.428 --> 01:50:16.754]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:19.764 --> 01:50:24.747]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:25.248 --> 01:50:28.710]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:29.090 --> 01:50:31.612]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:50:31.652 --> 01:50:32.813]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:32.833 --> 01:50:33.533]  They're not after money.
[01:50:33.553 --> 01:50:34.674]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:35.635]  They're after power.
[01:50:35.875 --> 01:50:36.655]  That's what they're after.
[01:50:37.036 --> 01:50:45.241]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:45.781 --> 01:50:46.202]  Endgame.
[01:50:46.502 --> 01:50:48.203]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:50:48.543 --> 01:50:49.604]  You have been warned.

[01:51:53.452 --> 01:51:56.733]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[01:51:57.193 --> 01:51:57.473]  Hemp.
[01:51:57.873 --> 01:52:00.634]  Used for food, clothing and shelter since time began.
[01:52:00.974 --> 01:52:01.294]  Hemp.
[01:52:01.615 --> 01:52:08.097]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:52:08.437 --> 01:52:11.678]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:52:11.958 --> 01:52:15.479]  The protein powder, seeds and oil are available through hempusa.org.
[01:52:16.139 --> 01:52:20.461]  Recommended daily intake of this food source will allow the body to heal itself from many ailments.

[01:52:27.565 --> 01:52:31.867]  Hemp can be stored with a long shelf life as a life-sustaining food source for you and your family.
[01:52:32.067 --> 01:52:33.948]  Could this be the government's best-kept secret?

[01:52:51.454 --> 01:53:02.896]  Yeah, I'll take a gamble for the truth.
[01:53:03.236 --> 01:53:04.536]  For standing up for what's right.
[01:53:04.576 --> 01:53:05.476]  To fight tyranny.
[01:53:05.496 --> 01:53:07.656]  You fool, I'll tell you how to play.
[01:53:07.897 --> 01:53:09.137]  You win, you lose.
[01:53:09.197 --> 01:53:09.937]  I'll be too late.
[01:53:12.077 --> 01:53:15.318]  Warren Cucurillo is our guest.
[01:53:16.378 --> 01:53:18.118]  Lead guitarist for Duran Duran.
[01:53:19.139 --> 01:53:24.200]  Written many of their best-selling songs.
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:25.840]  Successful restauranteur.
[01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:34.582]  And it's incredible that he also was in Frank Zappa's band.
[01:53:35.103 --> 01:53:36.443]  That's where he got really discovered.
[01:53:37.708 --> 01:53:41.450]  They're in good old Brooklyn, New York.
[01:53:41.570 --> 01:53:42.831]  All right, let's go back to Warren.
[01:53:43.511 --> 01:53:45.372]  By the way, I did see Willie Nelson last night.
[01:53:45.472 --> 01:53:47.673]  No, he was not there to see endgame at the Alamo.
[01:53:48.554 --> 01:53:55.958]  I was giving my speech, I walk out and they go, Willie Nelson just walked up and was looking at your stuff and saying he was going to come back later and get some of it.
[01:53:56.478 --> 01:53:57.398]  And I went, incredible!
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:01.861]  And then the thing let out ended.
[01:54:02.839 --> 01:54:08.223]  About 10 o'clock, I'm out there, and Aaron already had a camera out there to tape me talking to the crowd and stuff.
[01:54:08.243 --> 01:54:08.963]  We always do that.
[01:54:12.446 --> 01:54:16.089]  But then Aaron didn't get me on tape because he was off doing something else, filming the crowd.
[01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:26.576]  And all of a sudden, I look over and he comes over kind of behind the tables, comes beside the table and over to me, and sticks his hand out and says, and I said, oh hey, here, have some of these films.
[01:54:26.596 --> 01:54:27.517]  I happen to have a few endgames.
[01:54:27.557 --> 01:54:29.118]  I wasn't selling them yet because they're not out yet.
[01:54:29.358 --> 01:54:30.319]  But I said, here are some endgames.
[01:54:30.339 --> 01:54:30.599]  Here's this.
[01:54:31.403 --> 01:54:33.024]  And he says, well, I like your work.
[01:54:33.884 --> 01:54:35.905]  And then his wife is like, come on, we gotta go.
[01:54:35.945 --> 01:54:36.886]  The crowd's starting to get around him.
[01:54:36.906 --> 01:54:39.287]  And they start going, and I start following out, and he's already gone ahead.
[01:54:39.307 --> 01:54:41.348]  She'd stopped, and I talked to her, got her car.
[01:54:41.368 --> 01:54:42.168]  I'm gonna try to get him on.
[01:54:42.328 --> 01:54:42.748]  We'll see.
[01:54:43.509 --> 01:54:47.951]  I'm probably too dangerous for him to come on the show, but, uh, and she said, yeah, we like your work.
[01:54:48.031 --> 01:54:48.491]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:54:49.031 --> 01:54:50.071]  But I don't know what that means.
[01:54:50.151 --> 01:54:51.712]  But who knows with Willie Nelson?
[01:54:51.732 --> 01:54:54.053]  If we got Willie Nelson on our side, I know he's anti-war.
[01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:57.395]  By the way, they threatened to not play his music on the radio stations.
[01:54:57.435 --> 01:54:58.555]  He just said, go ahead, don't.
[01:54:59.176 --> 01:54:59.976]  He goes, I don't care.
[01:55:00.620 --> 01:55:08.225]  I'm going to say, you know, that's the incredible thing, Warren, is how they banned the Dixie Chicks on all those stations for a while.
[01:55:08.265 --> 01:55:09.406]  They only made them bigger, by the way.
[01:55:09.726 --> 01:55:19.692]  I mean, the fact that in this country that they try to censor people with threats of blacklisting, I mean, that's right out of, you know, the Red Hunts or something.
[01:55:20.052 --> 01:55:22.634]  And remember, everything they're signing is so safe.
[01:55:22.854 --> 01:55:25.016]  You know, the censorship starts right there.
[01:55:25.656 --> 01:55:27.817]  You know, when they sign an act, you know, they know they're safe.
[01:55:28.658 --> 01:55:30.019]  They don't want anybody controversial.
[01:55:31.872 --> 01:55:35.054]  Well, I mean, it's scary that they tried to bully Willie Nelson.
[01:55:35.074 --> 01:55:37.576]  They tried to bully others in country music who were going against him.
[01:55:37.636 --> 01:55:44.661]  I mean, you know, they... It's the question of do you care more about having your song on the radio or saving your people, saving your country?
[01:55:44.981 --> 01:55:46.021]  That's the thing, you know?
[01:55:46.162 --> 01:55:47.743]  It's Peter Finch and Network.
[01:55:47.783 --> 01:55:49.124]  People need to watch that movie.
[01:55:49.544 --> 01:55:51.125]  And then they need to watch Aviva Vendetta.
[01:55:53.260 --> 01:55:56.823]  Well, I mean, that's why I respect him like Willie Nelson so much, because he just doesn't care.
[01:55:57.263 --> 01:56:00.466]  Well, I've got a couple of people on my list for you, Alex.
[01:56:00.986 --> 01:56:02.967]  Over the next few weeks, I'll be speaking to them.
[01:56:03.088 --> 01:56:05.870]  I've got an email of somebody that I'm going to send him a letter tonight.
[01:56:07.191 --> 01:56:09.733]  Two very, very, very big actors.
[01:56:10.873 --> 01:56:11.334]  Very big.
[01:56:11.354 --> 01:56:14.836]  Yeah, you know the truth is going to be at your throat to give you those numbers.
[01:56:14.877 --> 01:56:16.918]  Please, I want those big guests.
[01:56:18.099 --> 01:56:20.461]  Oh, Lord Cucarillo, give it to me.
[01:56:20.561 --> 01:56:21.962]  One of them is a fellow Texan.
[01:56:23.209 --> 01:56:25.593]  And the other one was in the British Secret Service.
[01:56:38.664 --> 01:56:40.967]  Let's see, can we talk about martial law for a second, Alex?
[01:56:40.987 --> 01:56:42.829]  Because you have dark hair or blonde hair?
[01:56:45.892 --> 01:56:46.593]  One of each.
[01:56:47.234 --> 01:56:48.235]  Oh my gosh.
[01:56:48.355 --> 01:56:48.835]  One of each.
[01:56:49.176 --> 01:56:50.097]  I'm going to shut up.
[01:56:50.117 --> 01:56:51.899]  We've got 20 minutes with you in the next hour.
[01:56:52.159 --> 01:56:54.361]  I want to get into Zappa, but what were you about to say?
[01:56:54.802 --> 01:56:55.483]  Yeah, martial law.
[01:56:55.503 --> 01:56:57.144]  9-11 happens, okay?
[01:56:59.232 --> 01:57:00.592]  Three states were attacked.
[01:57:01.453 --> 01:57:02.613]  Absolute mayhem.
[01:57:03.433 --> 01:57:06.695]  Our president comes on TV and tells us what?
[01:57:07.275 --> 01:57:08.415]  To go shopping.
[01:57:09.315 --> 01:57:09.676]  Okay?
[01:57:09.916 --> 01:57:10.856]  I remember that, yes.
[01:57:10.976 --> 01:57:12.797]  He told us to go shopping.
[01:57:12.877 --> 01:57:13.657]  Get out there.
[01:57:13.717 --> 01:57:14.657]  Go to the movies.
[01:57:14.737 --> 01:57:15.658]  Go shopping.
[01:57:16.458 --> 01:57:19.359]  So what is all this preparation for martial law?
[01:57:19.399 --> 01:57:21.499]  The worst attack on American soil ever.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:22.420]  What happened?
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:25.841]  Americans got together and helped all they could.
[01:57:25.881 --> 01:57:26.821]  They sent their money.
[01:57:26.921 --> 01:57:27.261]  Stay there.
[01:57:27.281 --> 01:57:27.501]  Stay there.
[01:57:27.522 --> 01:57:28.462]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:57:31.050 --> 01:57:35.692]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:35.712 --> 01:57:36.012]  Big Brother.
[01:57:47.765 --> 01:57:48.825]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:49.546 --> 01:57:50.626]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:51.306 --> 01:57:52.107]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.867 --> 01:57:54.788]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:54.808 --> 01:57:58.109]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.629 --> 01:58:02.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.213 --> 01:58:19.597]  Oh man, the stuff that Warren Cucurillo just laid on me during that 72nd break, I am literally, my heart is beating.
[01:58:20.998 --> 01:58:28.022]  Because I know a few big Hollywood people, not as many as Warren does by a long shot, and I know they all know about 9-11, I know it's hot in L.A.
[01:58:28.042 --> 01:58:39.087]  and all over the world for years, but none of them will go public, but Charlie, who's got so much courage, he just told me huge people that he's confirmed know all about it, but that's all I can say, and that they might go public.
[01:58:39.207 --> 01:58:40.548]  I just, it blows me away.
[01:58:41.838 --> 01:58:43.839]  I mean, the New World Order scared Warren.
[01:58:43.859 --> 01:58:44.600]  That's what I was saying.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:48.823]  I've been watching television when they talk about 9-11 truth, and they're scared now.
[01:58:49.303 --> 01:58:55.287]  If we're going to fly that United States flag, it has to be at least the home of the brave.
[01:58:56.348 --> 01:59:00.570]  You know, we're not exactly as free as we once were, but we are braver than ever.
[01:59:02.111 --> 01:59:02.572]  That's it.
[01:59:02.992 --> 01:59:04.273]  Oh, another great line!
[01:59:04.293 --> 01:59:06.094]  Okay, so here we go.
[01:59:06.855 --> 01:59:17.566]  Everybody knows, everybody in media, any guy walking down the street knows that the 9-11 omission report was a complete whitewash, including Lee Hamilton.
[01:59:18.187 --> 01:59:18.347]  Right?
[01:59:19.164 --> 01:59:20.644]  So, you know, Bill Maher must know that.
[01:59:21.125 --> 01:59:26.726]  Bill Maher must know that there's very, very serious questions about what happened to our brothers and sisters on that day.
[01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:33.848]  So, does he not understand what it means to stand up for the fallen, to be the voices of those who are gone?
[01:59:34.008 --> 01:59:35.108]  Does he not understand that?
[01:59:35.448 --> 01:59:38.609]  Don't we need to find out everything about that day and what led to their deaths?
[01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:47.352]  How could he be so shallow as to diss the truth with his audience getting out to that many people?
[01:59:47.772 --> 01:59:48.312]  Okay, maybe
[01:59:49.091 --> 02:00:05.659]  A few people in this media mess after that confrontation on his show live, maybe a few people would have looked it up and got onto the right side of what's going on, but a lot of other people are just going, oh yeah, those crazy morons, give them some Paxil.
[02:00:06.246 --> 02:00:21.046]  You know, and it's like they just get on with their day and just thinking it's just more negativity in the sheeple's heads to go, you know, for the people who are actually trying to save all of us and make people aware of what's going on right under their feet.
[02:00:21.781 --> 02:00:28.343]  And you know, you've got a guy like Bill Maher and you've got another guy like Jon Stewart who are making jokes about it and demeaning it.
[02:00:28.764 --> 02:00:30.864]  Well, if you think that's bad, we're going to get the clip.
[02:00:30.904 --> 02:00:32.905]  By the way, it's up on Infowars.net, Jon, grab it.
[02:00:33.745 --> 02:00:38.287]  Beck, 9-11 truthers, insane, these are quotes, dangerous anarchists, the kind of group
[02:00:38.647 --> 02:00:42.169]  Yeah, if you're going to say we're like them, at least try and get us some FBI funding then.
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:11.261]  You know, believe me, we're just blowing up myths.
[02:01:11.301 --> 02:01:12.781]  We should be able to get funding for that.
[02:01:13.841 --> 02:01:14.301]  Exactly.
[02:01:15.042 --> 02:01:19.643]  If the terrorist funded, whether it's 7-7, 9-11, OKC, then why not?
[02:01:19.663 --> 02:01:24.083]  Does Anderson Cooper still have that keeping them honest thing on his show?
[02:01:24.103 --> 02:01:25.424]  Because I don't watch TV anymore.
[02:01:25.744 --> 02:01:27.324]  A few months ago, I did still see it.
[02:01:27.364 --> 02:01:28.984]  You have a little CIA operative, admittedly.
[02:01:29.024 --> 02:01:31.225]  Yeah, well, I have a little message for him.
[02:01:32.634 --> 02:01:34.897]  I don't care if you're a top or a bottom or whatever.
[02:01:35.418 --> 02:01:37.682]  I just want to know who's keeping you honest.
[02:01:38.282 --> 02:01:41.908]  You guys better start representing the people or the people will be your downfall.
[02:01:42.455 --> 02:01:45.396]  Well, Anderson Cooper strutting around acting tough is pretty funny.
[02:01:45.616 --> 02:01:46.657]  But is he a top or a bottom?
[02:01:46.917 --> 02:01:47.957]  Uh-huh, I think you know the answer.
[02:01:47.977 --> 02:01:49.458]  But the point, Alcala, we got children.
[02:01:49.478 --> 02:01:50.218]  Let's be careful.
[02:01:50.838 --> 02:01:52.119]  No, I mean, seriously, though.
[02:01:52.459 --> 02:01:56.640]  Anderson Cooper, admittedly, was inducted into the CIA, and then he claims, oh, he quit.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:58.001]  No, he didn't quit.
[02:01:58.041 --> 02:01:58.901]  He's an operative.
[02:01:58.921 --> 02:02:02.082]  Did you know that he is the heir to the Astor fortune?
[02:02:02.522 --> 02:02:09.865]  I know that, and I also know that he spent quite a lot of time in Burma at the time when all other journalists were in the Balkans.
[02:02:11.192 --> 02:02:12.212]  What was he doing in Burma?
[02:02:14.133 --> 02:02:19.134]  Well, he's a spook and a half, and, uh... Perhaps a luck and fewtly.
[02:02:20.294 --> 02:02:23.215]  Oh my gosh, Warren Cookerill, ladies and gentlemen, he's out of control.
[02:02:23.795 --> 02:02:24.735]  He is something else.
[02:02:24.755 --> 02:02:25.836]  He's pure rock and roll.
[02:02:26.436 --> 02:02:28.916]  And he is fighting for liberty and freedom.
[02:02:28.996 --> 02:02:29.636]  God bless him.
[02:02:30.117 --> 02:02:35.198]  We'll be right back, right here, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:35.358 --> 02:02:39.139]  Endgame hits PrisonPlanet.tv in two days!
[02:02:42.392 --> 02:02:43.812]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:43.832 --> 02:02:45.933]  A New World Order.
[02:02:46.633 --> 02:02:51.074]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:51.134 --> 02:02:53.294]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[02:02:53.574 --> 02:02:56.595]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[02:02:57.135 --> 02:02:59.596]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:00.316 --> 02:03:07.658]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:15.652]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[02:03:19.995 --> 02:03:22.497]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[02:03:22.557 --> 02:03:23.718]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:23.738 --> 02:03:24.438]  They're not after money.
[02:03:24.458 --> 02:03:25.559]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:25.799 --> 02:03:26.520]  They're after power.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:27.780]  That's what they're after.

[02:04:41.508 --> 02:04:43.349]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:04:43.489 --> 02:04:48.652]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:04:48.672 --> 02:04:50.193]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:04:50.453 --> 02:04:58.618]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:04:58.858 --> 02:05:04.581]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:05:04.741 --> 02:05:06.522]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:05:06.582 --> 02:05:08.744]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:05:08.764 --> 02:05:13.167]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:05:13.307 --> 02:05:15.448]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:05:15.528 --> 02:05:22.073]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular
[02:05:24.707 --> 02:05:28.969]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:29.069 --> 02:05:31.630]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:54.364 --> 02:06:06.314]  Well, I think you can tell, listeners, that I'm really enjoying this interview, and I can sit here and look at the web stats and stream stats and tell that you're enjoying it, because we've got all-time record streams of folks tuning in right now.
[02:06:06.334 --> 02:06:10.077]  Now, Warren Cucurillo, right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:10.397 --> 02:06:14.560]  Don't forget, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, hits the Internet Thursday night.
[02:06:14.681 --> 02:06:17.143]  It's supposedly Friday morning, but I'm going to put it out a few hours early.
[02:06:17.203 --> 02:06:22.427]  Thursday night, starting right, we might even release it earlier than midnight.
[02:06:22.467 --> 02:06:23.688]  I just can't wait to get it out.
[02:06:24.569 --> 02:06:26.710]  But just watch for it Thursday afternoon, Thursday night.
[02:06:27.811 --> 02:06:29.611]  And it's going to be available first on the web.
[02:06:29.852 --> 02:06:30.532]  You can order right now.
[02:06:30.572 --> 02:06:31.552]  We ship it out Monday.
[02:06:31.572 --> 02:06:33.693]  End game on DVD.
[02:06:35.094 --> 02:06:38.616]  I want to get into Frank Zappa in the 20 minutes that we've got left with you, Warren.
[02:06:40.657 --> 02:06:44.879]  You Sunday mentioned that he had been on Crossfire back in 82.
[02:06:46.793 --> 02:06:49.976]  And, uh, sure enough, he was being cripple-teamed when he was on the show.
[02:06:50.056 --> 02:06:58.003]  I found the 22-minute interview with Frank Zappa, who, by the way, called himself a conservative, and pointed out that these other people that claim to be conservative really weren't conservative.
[02:06:58.023 --> 02:07:02.186]  He was kind of like a Ron Paul, uh, before his, uh, time.
[02:07:02.827 --> 02:07:05.409]  And it's just too bad that, uh, Frank died of cancer, what, in 92, 93?
[02:07:05.930 --> 02:07:07.511]  He was also a classical composer.
[02:07:08.052 --> 02:07:09.573]  Uh, tell us about Frank Zappa.
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:12.480]  Well, you know, Frank was so ahead of the game.
[02:07:12.740 --> 02:07:27.004]  Alex, you know, his first album, Freak Out, in 1966, he had a song called Hungry Freaks Daddy, and a song called Who Are The Brain Police, which deal with mind control and, you know, false government, you know, government lies.
[02:07:27.084 --> 02:07:35.546]  On his second album, he had a song called Plastic People, and there's a line that says, take a day, walk around, watch the Nazis run your town, then go home and check yourself.
[02:07:35.706 --> 02:07:37.186]  You think we're singing about someone else?
[02:07:38.243 --> 02:07:43.269]  You know, he has a song called I Am The Slime in 1973, all about television.
[02:07:43.729 --> 02:07:48.175]  You know, I'm the tool of the government and industry, too, and I am destined to rule and regulate you.
[02:07:48.995 --> 02:07:51.238]  You know, it's unbelievable what he was saying.
[02:07:51.258 --> 02:07:58.006]  And, you know, if he was as popular as, let's say, John Lennon as far as radio play goes, because Frank was pretty much blacklisted from radio.
[02:07:58.783 --> 02:07:59.523]  And with good reason.
[02:07:59.563 --> 02:08:02.965]  You'd think the people who are controlling media, they didn't want those kind of words out there.
[02:08:02.985 --> 02:08:04.806]  They didn't want people singing those lines.
[02:08:04.866 --> 02:08:09.389]  By the way, was it Czechoslovakia or Romania that hired him to run the economics?
[02:08:09.409 --> 02:08:10.349]  I mean, he was a genius.
[02:08:10.389 --> 02:08:15.872]  His dad had been like a, you know, chemical scientist for the highest levels in secret Pentagon ops.
[02:08:16.192 --> 02:08:19.013]  You know, he had probably like 170 IQ, Frank did.
[02:08:19.534 --> 02:08:21.815]  And the point is, is that suddenly the U.S.
[02:08:21.835 --> 02:08:24.136]  government threatened him, threatened the government.
[02:08:24.156 --> 02:08:25.937]  I saw this in mainstream articles I pulled up.
[02:08:26.197 --> 02:08:27.698]  And then suddenly Frank dies of cancer.
[02:08:28.159 --> 02:08:33.532]  He was threatened by... well, not threatened, but he was friends with Buckler Powell.
[02:08:34.367 --> 02:08:37.009]  And he was dealing with the Czechoslovakians.
[02:08:37.029 --> 02:08:41.273]  He was also setting up trade deals with the Russians.
[02:08:41.353 --> 02:08:42.554]  And he was very involved.
[02:08:42.614 --> 02:08:47.177]  And he took about a year and a half off from music and was just doing these business deals.
[02:08:47.237 --> 02:08:48.158]  And he was really into it.
[02:08:48.178 --> 02:08:50.020]  He's probably one of the greatest guys that could ever do it.
[02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:54.924]  Because he believes that if you want to have peace in the world, everybody should just start selling things to each other.
[02:08:55.564 --> 02:08:56.745]  We don't have to blow each other up.
[02:08:57.586 --> 02:09:01.049]  I've been going and listening to him, and he sounds like Ron Paul.
[02:09:01.509 --> 02:09:02.710]  That threat you were talking about?
[02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:05.350]  Yes.
[02:09:06.770 --> 02:09:08.752]  I actually pulled up the very news articles.
[02:09:08.772 --> 02:09:24.603]  I didn't believe it when I saw it on Wikipedia, and I went and did a Google search, and there were the news articles, mainstream clippings and things, where they threatened sanctions on Czechoslovakia, and it was also Romania and other countries, if they made him the head of the head economic minister.
[02:09:25.243 --> 02:09:25.684]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:25.704 --> 02:09:28.706]  His exact line was, you're either with the United States government or you're with Zappa.
[02:09:46.452 --> 02:09:49.173]  It's like you're either with us or you're with the false flag cover engineers.
[02:09:49.353 --> 02:09:56.936]  Well, you know, privately talking to Aaron Russo, he thought that they may have, I don't want to get into private medical stuff, but he had an exam and then suddenly got the cancer.
[02:09:57.256 --> 02:10:00.698]  He thought, he'd been threatened, he thought they may have given him the cancer that killed him.
[02:10:01.018 --> 02:10:04.980]  We know, going back to the 40s, they had cancer that they can give you that's communicable.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.181]  That's mainstream television amidst that now.
[02:10:08.181 --> 02:10:11.683]  It's very curious that within months of him doing that, he suddenly gets cancer.
[02:10:12.216 --> 02:10:20.699]  Yeah, well, I can't even go there, but believe me, I've thought about it a lot, and I would never completely ace it out.
[02:10:20.739 --> 02:10:21.959]  We know what happened to John Lennon.
[02:10:23.420 --> 02:10:25.460]  That was World Vision.
[02:10:25.860 --> 02:10:37.444]  Two shooters, the John Lennon and the Reagan shooters, both worked for World Vision, which has been caught running CIA mind-control ops mainstream under third-world missionary covers.
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.384]  And the head of it was John Hinckley Jr.'
[02:10:42.364 --> 02:10:48.849]  's father, was the head of World Vision.
[02:10:49.770 --> 02:10:53.653]  And then he goes, I mean folks, how much more obvious does this get?
[02:10:55.695 --> 02:10:59.839]  I don't know what's going on Alex, but let's look at Zappa's interview here from 1991, February 9th.
[02:11:02.023 --> 02:11:06.124]  Interview with an Austrian activist journalist named Stefan Sesnauer.
[02:11:06.244 --> 02:11:07.924]  Now stop right there, because this is big.
[02:11:07.964 --> 02:11:11.065]  This has never before been heard, and this gentleman just gave us to you.
[02:11:11.085 --> 02:11:15.325]  You're not authorized to publish the whole thing, but you're authorized to talk about some of the premises for us.
[02:11:16.545 --> 02:11:21.526]  Well, Stefan was a friend of one of Frank's tech guys.
[02:11:22.627 --> 02:11:27.247]  And, you know, he always wanted to do an interview with Frank, and Stefan's a pretty brilliant guy himself.
[02:11:27.367 --> 02:11:31.228]  So I was very pleased to get this in my hands in the first question.
[02:11:32.359 --> 02:11:35.640]  Is George Bush is promoting a New World Order.
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:38.621]  Didn't Hitler use that phrase the last time?
[02:11:39.221 --> 02:11:41.021]  And Frank says, exactly.
[02:11:41.742 --> 02:11:47.343]  The thing is that the people in the United States know so little about history that nobody went, what the blank are you talking about?
[02:11:47.363 --> 02:11:56.266]  The first the first day that he said New World Order seems to me that there may be some slight differences in the design between Hitler's New World Order and George Bush's.
[02:11:56.706 --> 02:11:58.566]  But there are some strong similarities, too.
[02:11:58.606 --> 02:12:00.847]  And every time he used that expression, I go crazy.
[02:12:03.191 --> 02:12:04.853]  That was the first question of the interview.
[02:12:05.013 --> 02:12:10.598]  Can you read a little more where it gets into how he explains the system?
[02:12:11.839 --> 02:12:14.662]  Let me just continue with what you read to me over the phone, but just go ahead.
[02:12:14.962 --> 02:12:20.247]  Yeah, the next question was, I just read today in the paper that he's trying to change the atomic plant laws in America.
[02:12:20.687 --> 02:12:25.311]  It took us a long time to reduce the output and now he's lobbying the industry to open it up.
[02:12:26.152 --> 02:12:26.993]  You want to hear his answer?
[02:12:28.014 --> 02:12:28.334]  Go ahead.
[02:12:29.932 --> 02:12:46.177]  He's trying to create what they call a national energy policy, but his policy is so non-creative that basically all he is suggesting is that we build more nuclear plants and start drilling in all the offshore locations and all the protected wildlife areas that people have struggled for the last 20 years to have these wildlife areas set aside.
[02:12:46.557 --> 02:12:52.519]  And now because there is a war, all he has to do is make the suggestion and they'll drill anywhere and build all these nuclear plants.
[02:12:53.211 --> 02:12:56.555]  The fact is no one has found a way to dispose of spent nuclear fuel.
[02:12:56.575 --> 02:12:58.257]  There's no safe way to dispose of it.
[02:12:58.657 --> 02:13:01.741]  And the operation of these facilities have been proven unsafe over time.
[02:13:02.121 --> 02:13:03.543]  And they have a limited lifespan.
[02:13:03.863 --> 02:13:06.967]  What is it, 30 years before the entire facility becomes radioactive?
[02:13:07.447 --> 02:13:09.510]  And that's not a very progressive energy policy.
[02:13:11.122 --> 02:13:23.334]  There was another quote I think you read to me out of there just about what this new order is going to look like, but you want to talk to your friend and did he specify when it could be published or if it ever will be?
[02:13:23.774 --> 02:13:24.835]  I'm not sure if it ever was out.
[02:13:24.895 --> 02:13:30.641]  I wasn't able to find it on the internet, so that's something, but I'm going to try and get in touch with him when I get back and see what we can do.
[02:13:31.261 --> 02:13:38.347]  Well, Warren, you just continue to bring bombshell after bombshell here, and we'll certainly at least get that blurb out on the New World Order.
[02:13:38.947 --> 02:13:43.010]  So Frank recognized what the New World Order really is and what it stands for.
[02:13:44.151 --> 02:13:46.293]  Yeah, oh, here's an interesting one here, actually.
[02:13:46.573 --> 02:13:47.374]  This is an interesting one.
[02:13:47.394 --> 02:13:49.576]  Let me get this one here.
[02:13:51.117 --> 02:13:54.760]  Do you think education under the Reagan administration got poorer and poorer?
[02:13:56.713 --> 02:13:59.314]  I think it already started to fall apart under Nixon.
[02:13:59.634 --> 02:14:11.258]  If you look at the situation in the US, the whole thing could be corrected if the people in this country were better educated, if there was a better mental health situation, because people with good mental health don't do wars, and people with good educations won't vote for a war.
[02:14:11.458 --> 02:14:15.559]  They won't support the idea of solving problems in this way, because I can't imagine any circumstance
[02:14:16.019 --> 02:14:17.760]  In which you could logically say that the U.S.
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:18.680]  will win this war.
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:20.000]  He's talking about the first Gulf War.
[02:14:20.460 --> 02:14:22.301]  You can't win it if you kill Saddam Hussein.
[02:14:22.341 --> 02:14:22.981]  He still wins.
[02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:23.801]  He becomes a hero.
[02:14:24.201 --> 02:14:27.862]  And they sold the idea to the American public with statements like one senator.
[02:14:28.302 --> 02:14:30.523]  His name was Daniel Inouye.
[02:14:30.743 --> 02:14:31.663]  The guy from Hawaii.
[02:14:32.104 --> 02:14:35.404]  He said the war might last five days and there may be a few hundred casualties.
[02:14:35.885 --> 02:14:37.085]  That's the way they were talking.
[02:14:37.305 --> 02:14:44.587]  And I think we're looking at at least two years with 25 to 50 years of occupation and constant world terrorism.
[02:14:45.322 --> 02:14:46.203]  As a result of it.
[02:14:47.044 --> 02:14:48.446]  There's your new world order.
[02:14:49.487 --> 02:14:50.709]  Unbelievable!
[02:14:50.869 --> 02:14:53.152]  Frank Zappa interview with who?
[02:14:53.652 --> 02:14:54.814]  Stefan Ceznana.
[02:14:55.484 --> 02:14:58.505]  N-V-E-N-O-N-E-R.
[02:14:59.026 --> 02:15:02.147]  And it doesn't say, he didn't tell you if it was ever published.
[02:15:02.227 --> 02:15:05.649]  It sounds like it wasn't if it doesn't have a line there of where it came from.
[02:15:06.409 --> 02:15:07.970]  Let's play a little clip, a little short clip.
[02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:10.411]  Let's play him talking about the Hellfire Club.
[02:15:10.431 --> 02:15:12.532]  They're talking about the federal government censoring music.
[02:15:12.872 --> 02:15:15.634]  He says, oh, you mean words, because then it'll be everything.
[02:15:15.974 --> 02:15:18.855]  And then he goes, oh yes, Benjamin Franklin, the Hellfire Club.
[02:15:19.115 --> 02:15:21.136]  I mean, nobody was talking about the Hellfire Club in 1982.
[02:15:21.196 --> 02:15:21.577]  Here it is.
[02:15:23.849 --> 02:15:32.582]  Would you look in the camera and tell them with a straight face that you think the Founding Fathers had in mind the kind of garbage you sing and write when they drafted the First Amendment?
[02:15:32.602 --> 02:15:33.904]  Do you really believe that, Mr. Zappa?
[02:15:34.798 --> 02:15:35.659]  I don't think it applies.
[02:15:35.699 --> 02:15:37.840]  The Founding Fathers, one thing, kept slaves.
[02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:41.081]  And take a look at what Benjamin Franklin used to do over at the Hellfire Club.
[02:15:41.242 --> 02:15:44.083]  But you have repeatedly... Not exactly a bunch of swell guys.
[02:15:44.383 --> 02:15:46.484]  Okay, that's one of the clips.
[02:15:46.624 --> 02:15:48.445]  Let's go ahead and play the other clip.
[02:15:48.465 --> 02:15:54.028]  This is him talking about how we're going to be in a fascist dictatorship in this country, how we're moving towards that.
[02:15:54.449 --> 02:15:57.790]  ...of our civil government to help protect our families.
[02:15:57.830 --> 02:15:58.651]  How could you oppose that?
[02:15:58.931 --> 02:16:00.592]  Does the government have any purpose, Frank?
[02:16:00.812 --> 02:16:02.452]  Yeah, there's a number of purposes.
[02:16:02.532 --> 02:16:05.414]  I'm not going to give you a civics lesson here, but I'll tell you one thing.
[02:16:05.474 --> 02:16:10.676]  We must not see eye to eye on the idea of a government that must forbid things in order to protect us.
[02:16:10.696 --> 02:16:10.816]  Really?
[02:16:10.836 --> 02:16:11.576]  What is the government's role?
[02:16:11.596 --> 02:16:12.656]  You've told me several times.
[02:16:12.716 --> 02:16:14.277]  What about national defense?
[02:16:14.297 --> 02:16:16.098]  Yeah, I consider this national defense, pal.
[02:16:16.838 --> 02:16:20.720]  Families are under attack from people like you with these lyrics.
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:22.261]  John, you don't have to buy them.
[02:16:22.741 --> 02:16:25.783]  Could I make a statement about national defense?
[02:16:25.843 --> 02:16:26.103]  Yeah.
[02:16:26.163 --> 02:16:28.844]  The biggest threat to America today is not communism.
[02:16:28.924 --> 02:16:31.846]  It's moving America toward a fascist theocracy.
[02:16:32.206 --> 02:16:36.248]  And everything that's happened during the Reagan administration is steering us right down that pipe.
[02:16:36.608 --> 02:16:54.774]  Oh, Mr. Zaffer, do you really think... I mean, all kidding aside, in this country, with the permissiveness that we are moving toward a fascist theography... You think things like this will ever be permitted?
[02:16:55.314 --> 02:17:00.635]  We're going to re-record that and play it again later in this hour or tomorrow, because somebody at the computer recorded it with those breaks.
[02:17:00.675 --> 02:17:02.396]  We didn't edit that.
[02:17:02.816 --> 02:17:03.576]  But there it is!
[02:17:03.616 --> 02:17:06.117]  You mentioned that to me Sunday, and we found it, Warren.
[02:17:06.657 --> 02:17:11.680]  Well, when I heard those lines, it blew my mind because that's a very, very long time ago.
[02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:13.321]  We're talking 25 years ago.
[02:17:14.481 --> 02:17:17.383]  And if people were listening, we know Kennedy warned us.
[02:17:17.403 --> 02:17:18.684]  We know Roosevelt warned us.
[02:17:18.704 --> 02:17:19.684]  We know everybody.
[02:17:19.784 --> 02:17:22.566]  Eisenhower warned us.
[02:17:22.706 --> 02:17:27.469]  I don't know what's with complacency and how long have these people been bought and paid for.
[02:17:27.489 --> 02:17:30.390]  It's just disgusting and it's all ending now.
[02:17:31.411 --> 02:17:32.211]  Absolutely.
[02:17:32.471 --> 02:17:33.352]  It's all over.
[02:17:34.486 --> 02:17:36.488]  Warren Cuccarillo, final segment with him.
[02:17:36.848 --> 02:17:38.789]  He's an amazing individual on the other side.
[02:17:42.192 --> 02:17:45.854]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[02:17:46.115 --> 02:17:49.697]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[02:17:49.937 --> 02:17:52.119]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial

[02:18:43.405 --> 02:18:46.008]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:46.568 --> 02:18:51.633]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[02:18:52.474 --> 02:18:56.458]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[02:18:57.038 --> 02:19:05.406]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[02:19:06.427 --> 02:19:16.876]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:17.817 --> 02:19:19.358]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:19.378 --> 02:19:19.739]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:19:32.699 --> 02:19:47.964]  If you own a business, you may know that incorporating can be a smart way to protect yourself and your assets.
[02:19:48.144 --> 02:19:51.485]  So the question is, why haven't you incorporated your business yet?
[02:19:51.665 --> 02:19:52.185]  My business?
[02:19:52.606 --> 02:19:53.626]  It's too small.
[02:19:53.706 --> 02:19:58.808]  The simple truth is, no matter how small your business, you run the risk of losing your personal assets.
[02:19:59.028 --> 02:20:00.108]  Your car, your home,
[02:20:02.615 --> 02:20:05.578]  Incorporating is very complicated.
[02:20:06.138 --> 02:20:08.680]  Actually, incorporating is easy and fast.
[02:20:08.900 --> 02:20:10.361]  You can do it in just 10 minutes.
[02:20:10.562 --> 02:20:13.304]  Call now for your free guide from the Company Corporation.
[02:20:13.324 --> 02:20:13.764]  1-800-331-1461.
[02:20:13.964 --> 02:20:18.088]  I need a lawyer to incorporate.
[02:20:18.128 --> 02:20:19.669]  That's really expensive.
[02:20:20.189 --> 02:20:21.811]  You don't need a lawyer to incorporate.
[02:20:22.031 --> 02:20:23.412]  Use the Company Corporation.
[02:20:23.512 --> 02:20:25.234]  They don't offer legal or financial advice.
[02:20:25.274 --> 02:20:26.855]  They just make incorporating simple.
[02:20:27.035 --> 02:20:29.477]  Their only mission is to help people like you incorporate
[02:20:33.217 --> 02:20:33.337]  1-800-331-1461.
[02:20:33.397 --> 02:20:33.597]  That's 1-800-331-1461.
[02:20:33.617 --> 02:20:33.837]  1-800-331-1461.
[02:20:33.857 --> 02:20:34.818]  It is a big idea.
[02:20:34.838 --> 02:20:36.018]  A new world order.
[02:20:36.038 --> 02:20:39.419]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful government.
[02:20:39.459 --> 02:20:41.500]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:47.542]  Both their objective being world domination.
[02:20:47.622 --> 02:20:52.244]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:21:00.895 --> 02:21:08.233]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:21:11.232 --> 02:21:16.235]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:21:16.696 --> 02:21:20.158]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:21:20.558 --> 02:21:23.060]  Bill Burdick is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:21:23.120 --> 02:21:24.281]  Most people have no idea.
[02:21:24.301 --> 02:21:25.061]  They're not after money.
[02:21:25.081 --> 02:21:26.142]  They have all the money they need.
[02:21:26.322 --> 02:21:27.103]  They're after power.
[02:21:27.343 --> 02:21:28.464]  That's what they're after, isn't it?
[02:21:28.484 --> 02:21:36.689]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:36.789 --> 02:21:39.591]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:21:40.011 --> 02:21:41.012]  You have been warned.
[02:21:41.194 --> 02:21:41.319]  Yeah.
[02:22:06.428 --> 02:22:08.750]  Final segment with Warren Cucarillo.
[02:22:08.770 --> 02:22:11.692]  We've got a link to him up on InfoWars.com.
[02:22:15.475 --> 02:22:19.438]  Again, big story up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:22:19.798 --> 02:22:23.381]  Beck, 9-11 Truthers, insane, dangerous, terrorists!
[02:22:23.401 --> 02:22:26.883]  Because we say you're the terrorists, because we know who really is behind it.
[02:22:28.665 --> 02:22:32.167]  Warren, finishing up with some 9-11 info, Zappi info.
[02:22:32.187 --> 02:22:33.248]  You wanted to talk about Blackwater.
[02:22:33.268 --> 02:22:34.169]  We never got to it, but go ahead.
[02:22:34.713 --> 02:22:40.696]  Yeah, well, you know, you heard Frank say it 25 years ago, heading towards a fascist theocracy, and where are we now?
[02:22:41.377 --> 02:22:46.479]  So the American people and the people of the world need to know that this is Orwell that does not end well.
[02:22:48.901 --> 02:22:55.104]  You only need half of the right side of your brain working to discern that, okay?
[02:22:55.464 --> 02:22:57.465]  Orwell, that does not end well.
[02:22:58.086 --> 02:22:59.526]  So let's get active.
[02:22:59.667 --> 02:23:00.827]  Let's get out there.
[02:23:01.508 --> 02:23:04.009]  And, you know, 9-11 truthers are insane.
[02:23:04.854 --> 02:23:19.844]  Well, let me tell you, ladies and gentlemen, when I saw Building 7 come down after Rosie O'Donnell mentioned it on television, the first thing that came into my mind is, does the secret government have many buildings rigged just like this all over the country?
[02:23:20.465 --> 02:23:31.592]  So I thought, do we need to get a list together and see, like, where there's some more dodgy security firms that might be run by somebody along the lines of Marvin P. Bush or one of their cronies?
[02:23:32.168 --> 02:23:32.448]  You know?
[02:23:33.189 --> 02:23:34.070]  What's going on?
[02:23:34.090 --> 02:23:40.135]  But all of that's a coincidence, and he ran the stuff at the Boston Logan, but everything's fine.
[02:23:40.555 --> 02:23:41.496]  Everything's fine.
[02:23:41.616 --> 02:23:44.939]  And what about when, you know, when they make their excuses to us?
[02:23:45.019 --> 02:23:55.428]  Like when we hear, you know, I failed you, your government failed you, and then there's no communication between all the different, you know, CIA and NSA and FBI.
[02:23:55.788 --> 02:23:57.289]  And what do they ask us for?
[02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:59.191]  How can they sort it all out, Alex?
[02:23:59.864 --> 02:24:02.032]  Give us more funding!
[02:24:03.357 --> 02:24:05.183]  That's what they asked for, isn't it?
[02:24:05.828 --> 02:24:06.568]  More money!
[02:24:07.029 --> 02:24:11.210]  Give us more money, and then we can communicate better with the other agents.
[02:24:11.270 --> 02:24:18.333]  And then the FBI agents that ordered, agents who requested hundreds of times they're going to fly planes into buildings, they get demoted or fired.
[02:24:18.373 --> 02:24:25.676]  The ones that blocked them get record cash bonuses, and General Myers, who did the NORAD Staddown, gets made chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:24:26.076 --> 02:24:26.837]  Yes, that's right.
[02:24:26.857 --> 02:24:32.279]  When you follow the money trail, and you see who gets promoted, you know who was doing their job that day.
[02:24:32.839 --> 02:24:37.680]  Now, it looks like in the mainstream media that they said, oh, sorry, we didn't do our job that day.
[02:24:37.940 --> 02:24:43.521]  Then they get promoted, so you know that the job they did was the one they were supposed to be doing, because that's what they got paid and promoted for.
[02:24:43.601 --> 02:24:44.081]  That's right.
[02:24:44.101 --> 02:24:46.442]  In the past, when somebody did a bad job, everybody got fired.
[02:24:46.482 --> 02:24:49.062]  Now it's, oh, no, anyone who tried to stop it is demoted.
[02:24:49.302 --> 02:24:50.783]  Anyone who helped is promoted.
[02:24:51.403 --> 02:24:52.523]  Key Bono.
[02:24:52.543 --> 02:24:54.504]  Who benefits?
[02:24:55.324 --> 02:24:55.824]  Key Bono.
[02:24:57.976 --> 02:24:58.556]  Absolutely.
[02:24:58.616 --> 02:25:08.999]  In closing, the whole Blackwater thing, this mercenary society, hundreds of thousands of them taking over, now operating domestically, I mean, they've got private armies now.
[02:25:09.019 --> 02:25:09.999]  This is total mafia.
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:23.023]  What surprised me about Blackwater is when it was reported on the news, people are so dumbed down and brainwashed when they started talking about, oh, mercenary group Blackwater that has, did they have nuclear?
[02:25:24.195 --> 02:25:25.216]  Do they use nukes as well?
[02:25:25.456 --> 02:25:25.756]  Oh, no.
[02:25:25.816 --> 02:25:26.797]  Well, not that we know of.
[02:25:26.817 --> 02:25:27.698]  Oh, I thought I read something.
[02:25:27.818 --> 02:25:30.100]  Anyway... I'm just saying, they're a very, very suspicious group.
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:36.044]  Yeah, but what happened is, the American people just was like, oh, yeah, you know, with the water cooler, oh, yeah, black water's in Iraq.
[02:25:36.685 --> 02:25:37.806]  Like, what's black water?
[02:25:38.586 --> 02:25:39.487]  Where's the oversight?
[02:25:39.547 --> 02:25:40.868]  Where is Eric Prince?
[02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:44.251]  When does a security firm become a private army?
[02:25:44.736 --> 02:25:47.638]  And why do we need a private army in Iraq?
[02:25:47.958 --> 02:25:49.199]  We've got National Guard.
[02:25:49.239 --> 02:25:50.560]  We've got loads of troops.
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:26:04.308]  Well, this is a total conflict of interest throughout history, because it lets the government then pay its cronies, and not even its military, and they pay them 150-something grand, 60 grand apiece, on average, and the troops get 25 grand and no medical half the time.
[02:26:04.608 --> 02:26:05.749]  I mean, think of folks!
[02:26:05.909 --> 02:26:07.150]  Mercenaries are dirty!
[02:26:07.410 --> 02:26:08.310]  It's a dirty thing.
[02:26:08.350 --> 02:26:09.311]  It's never been allowed.
[02:26:09.771 --> 02:26:13.033]  Any billionaire can now put together his own private army?
[02:26:13.053 --> 02:26:14.794]  That's a pretty scary thing.
[02:26:14.914 --> 02:26:16.035]  Who's watching these guys?
[02:26:16.075 --> 02:26:19.016]  We had six nuclear weapons put on an airplane, flown across the country.
[02:26:31.301 --> 02:26:36.972]  And, uh, you know, these are the guys who are watched by our, you know, the government, right?
[02:26:36.992 --> 02:26:41.019]  With all these, you know, how many levels of security they'd have to go through to get those bombs on that plane.
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:42.823]  So we know it wasn't an accident.
[02:26:43.425 --> 02:26:49.207]  Well, you're right, and Blackwater's operatives, this is Spookville, this is the Sovietization of America.
[02:26:49.247 --> 02:26:50.607]  I mean, it doesn't get any dirtier.
[02:26:50.907 --> 02:26:54.368]  Have you heard how they're hiring aggravated felons for the military and illegal aliens now?
[02:26:54.728 --> 02:26:58.730]  I mean, everything Stalin did, everything Hitler did, the government is doing it.
[02:26:59.110 --> 02:27:02.871]  But, I mean, they haven't had mercenaries since Germany had them 200 years ago.
[02:27:03.291 --> 02:27:06.552]  Frank Coccarello, it's MySpace, give them the website again.
[02:27:07.535 --> 02:27:11.238]  www.myspace.com slash Warren Cucurullo.
[02:27:11.258 --> 02:27:12.900]  Did you just call me Frank Cucurullo?
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:14.361]  No, I just called you Warren.
[02:27:14.541 --> 02:27:15.382]  Did I call you Frank?
[02:27:16.182 --> 02:27:17.563]  I think you called me Frank Cucurullo.
[02:27:17.623 --> 02:27:18.604]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:27:18.624 --> 02:27:19.785]  Frank you, Frank you very much.
[02:27:20.346 --> 02:27:21.967]  Hey, stay there.
[02:27:21.987 --> 02:27:22.768]  I want to talk to you during the break.
[02:27:22.788 --> 02:27:23.909]  I appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:27:24.189 --> 02:27:26.751]  Folks, we're going to have Ron Paul as a spokesman on the other side.
[02:27:32.235 --> 02:27:33.176]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.637 --> 02:27:35.138]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.127 --> 02:27:38.989]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.712 --> 02:27:44.654]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach.
[02:27:45.094 --> 02:27:46.795]  Look, up there in the sky.
[02:27:46.815 --> 02:27:48.557]  It's Non-X-Man.
[02:27:48.957 --> 02:27:50.098]  He's in a dive.
[02:27:50.418 --> 02:27:52.420]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach.
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:53.501]  Let's go look.
[02:27:55.702 --> 02:27:58.885]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel.
[02:27:59.285 --> 02:28:00.626]  Stop hiding them in the sand.
[02:28:00.846 --> 02:28:01.267]  Take them out.
[02:28:01.900 --> 02:28:02.581]  Let's see.
[02:28:02.601 --> 02:28:07.205]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[02:28:07.526 --> 02:28:08.006]  Don't worry.
[02:28:08.467 --> 02:28:09.988]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:28:10.609 --> 02:28:15.013]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[02:28:15.554 --> 02:28:17.616]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[02:28:17.736 --> 02:28:20.439]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[02:28:22.563 --> 02:28:25.225]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[02:28:25.686 --> 02:28:29.148]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[02:28:29.689 --> 02:28:40.798]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[02:28:41.926 --> 02:28:48.887]  When my son started having behavior problems, the total transformation techniques were like the instruction manual on how to deal with him.
[02:28:49.128 --> 02:28:50.368]  We got immediate results.
[02:28:50.708 --> 02:28:55.429]  Ever wish your kid came with an instruction manual when he's disrespectful, defiant, or even abusive?
[02:28:55.709 --> 02:28:56.509]  Do you know how to fix it?
[02:28:56.929 --> 02:29:02.310]  I'm behavioral therapist James Lehman, and I'll show you how to change your child's behavior right now with the Total Transformation.

[02:29:29.168 --> 02:29:29.268]  1-800-373-0402.
[02:29:29.308 --> 02:29:29.488]  Call now.
[02:29:35.612 --> 02:29:35.732]  1-800-373-0402.
[02:29:35.752 --> 02:29:35.812]  1-800-373-0402.
[02:29:35.832 --> 02:29:37.133]  Hi, Steve Shank, Fearless Task Force.
[02:29:37.153 --> 02:29:39.193]  Sure, you've got a mortgage and credit cards.
[02:29:39.214 --> 02:29:42.655]  Your debt creation is probably the smartest thing you've ever done.
[02:29:42.795 --> 02:29:45.736]  How would it be to find $75,000, $150,000, $200,000 or more you never knew you had?
[02:29:58.527 --> 02:30:02.951]  Now the task force has strategies to make these debts into virtual savings accounts.
[02:30:03.511 --> 02:30:05.853]  Ben Franklin said, a penny saved is a penny earned.
[02:30:06.473 --> 02:30:14.940]  By doing nothing more than you're doing right now, because you've used your credit, the right strategies can make the debt part of your financial life the smartest thing you've ever done.
[02:30:15.460 --> 02:30:18.162]  Oh, by the way, your strategies cost you nothing out of pocket.
[02:30:18.823 --> 02:30:21.605]  Go ahead and check out the debt elimination scams if you'd like to.
[02:30:22.145 --> 02:30:26.609]  You wouldn't take money from a loan shark, so you may not want to give your money to a debt shark,
[02:30:27.321 --> 02:30:30.863]  For an understanding of what a financial genius you truly are, call 800-409-5633.
[02:30:30.963 --> 02:30:32.084]  On the web, MyDebtFreePath.com.
[02:30:32.104 --> 02:30:32.144]  800-409-5633.
[02:30:32.184 --> 02:30:32.944]  This is the end.
[02:30:32.964 --> 02:30:33.745]  Beautiful prayer.
[02:30:57.083 --> 02:31:04.828]  I'll tell you this.
[02:31:07.970 --> 02:31:14.194]  You'll be, in the next few days and next few weeks, be hearing some very
[02:31:21.158 --> 02:31:22.539]  Big guest on this show.
[02:31:26.482 --> 02:31:28.644]  And you know with big guests, I sneak attack you.
[02:31:28.984 --> 02:31:29.865]  They just pop up.
[02:31:31.026 --> 02:31:33.227]  By the way, we're working on getting Ron Paul on the next few weeks.
[02:31:33.287 --> 02:31:37.751]  I'd like to get him on before this November 5th date, where they want to raise tens of millions on one day alone.
[02:31:38.751 --> 02:31:44.155]  Their trajectory, the congressman agreed the last few times he was on the last two months, he's on track to win the nomination.
[02:31:44.195 --> 02:31:46.097]  If it continued, well I've got some
[02:31:47.069 --> 02:31:47.870]  Bad news for you.
[02:31:48.090 --> 02:31:50.591]  It didn't continue the trajectory, and I'm being sarcastic.
[02:31:51.031 --> 02:31:52.552]  It went up even higher.
[02:31:53.052 --> 02:31:54.233]  So he got even better.
[02:31:55.193 --> 02:32:06.379]  The trajectory, that is from where you shoot your bullet to your target, before it was on target, if it continued to hit and get the nomination, the question is, well, could we continue that momentum?
[02:32:06.679 --> 02:32:07.840]  Well, you just turboed it.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.661]  You just went up even faster.
[02:32:10.701 --> 02:32:12.202]  Now, we can't guarantee it'll continue.
[02:32:12.242 --> 02:32:12.962]  We gotta push it.
[02:32:13.703 --> 02:32:15.844]  Only you can guarantee that's gonna take action.
[02:32:17.620 --> 02:32:27.484]  Individually out there, and they want to raise tens of millions on one day to freak the media out, and it would be a propaganda coup in the info war, but I don't care.
[02:32:27.524 --> 02:32:28.925]  Just don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[02:32:29.325 --> 02:32:30.005]  Get the money in.
[02:32:30.025 --> 02:32:32.927]  I know my family's given a lot of money.
[02:32:33.047 --> 02:32:33.947]  Just put it to you that way.
[02:32:35.301 --> 02:32:37.063]  A thousand here, a thousand there.
[02:32:37.083 --> 02:32:38.423]  My parents, a thousand here, a thousand there.
[02:32:38.864 --> 02:32:41.485]  And of course, you, the listeners, the Congressman, said he's gotten quite a bit here.
[02:32:41.505 --> 02:32:44.327]  But robpaul2008.com, we're giving a run for their money.
[02:32:44.567 --> 02:32:58.376]  And yeah, there's fraudulent machines in parts of the country, and yeah, there's scams, but if he's winning in polls, and if he's raising the most money, and if he's out there, and if the exit polls show something, just because they're cheating on the field doesn't mean we still can't play this game.
[02:32:58.616 --> 02:32:59.537]  Because we don't have a choice.
[02:33:00.137 --> 02:33:01.418]  The game's going to go on regardless.
[02:33:01.458 --> 02:33:02.619]  We've got to take the field.
[02:33:03.631 --> 02:33:05.412]  Jesse Benton is an amazing individual.
[02:33:05.452 --> 02:33:12.656]  He is the media coordinator, the press secretary there for the Ron Paul 2008.com campaign.
[02:33:13.457 --> 02:33:14.517]  And you've heard him many times here.
[02:33:14.537 --> 02:33:19.300]  We're going to get the campaign head on in the next week as well, and the congressman in the next two weeks, hopefully.
[02:33:19.900 --> 02:33:21.001]  We always appreciate his visits.
[02:33:22.001 --> 02:33:24.663]  But Ron Paul,
[02:33:26.154 --> 02:33:33.860]  One, I watch this every two years, whether it's off election or the big national presidential election, every two years.
[02:33:34.581 --> 02:33:46.770]  This is one of the key polls of Christian conservatives, and it was of tens of thousands, or 6,000, and he came in a healthy third place ahead of Fred Thompson and others.
[02:33:47.251 --> 02:33:47.931]  Giuliani got 2%.
[02:33:49.615 --> 02:33:50.135]  Ron Paul got 15%.
[02:33:51.476 --> 02:33:57.879]  And the New York Post, owned by Rupert Murdoch, did a story about everybody but him, and didn't even mention third place.
[02:33:58.319 --> 02:33:59.499]  And a bunch of other media did that.
[02:33:59.519 --> 02:34:01.040]  I don't have time to go over all of it.
[02:34:01.640 --> 02:34:09.884]  But Ron Paul said last week, we said last week, that suddenly everybody said he's first tier, he could win the nomination, Vegas odds even got better for him, only he can beat Hillary.
[02:34:10.224 --> 02:34:17.547]  But then, Rupert Murdoch and Fox are covering that up, and there's new counterattacks against him, and they're trying to ignore him.
[02:34:18.427 --> 02:34:20.009]  So, Jesse Benton, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:34:20.549 --> 02:34:21.029]  My pleasure, Al.
[02:34:21.049 --> 02:34:21.790]  It's great to be with you.
[02:34:22.290 --> 02:34:24.052]  Thanks for holding on to that diatribe.
[02:34:24.092 --> 02:34:26.574]  Comments on my paltry analysis?
[02:34:27.719 --> 02:34:30.440]  Well, you know, I think you're hitting the nail right on the head, Alex.
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:37.343]  I think that we are, you know, a lot of things that we're doing are being overlooked by the corporate mainstream media.
[02:34:37.963 --> 02:34:41.184]  And that's not to say that we're not getting more and more attention, because we are.
[02:34:41.464 --> 02:34:44.866]  And we're getting a lot of attention because people just really can't ignore this money we're pulling in.
[02:34:45.446 --> 02:34:51.188]  You know, $5.4 million in the bank, $1.7 million so far online this quarter alone on Pace.
[02:34:51.836 --> 02:34:55.739]  To hit our very, very aggressive goals that we're setting.
[02:34:56.079 --> 02:34:59.421]  So people, they're not able to ignore us quite like they might like to.
[02:35:00.341 --> 02:35:02.062]  But, you know, I think you're right.
[02:35:02.102 --> 02:35:10.308]  When people don't report on a legitimate third place finish in a very important straw poll amongst social conservatives, you've got to scratch your head a little bit.
[02:35:10.388 --> 02:35:16.852]  Now, I mean, I've been following politics for 15 years, not as long probably as you, but I've been following this poll in the last couple cycles.
[02:35:16.912 --> 02:35:17.872]  Isn't this a key poll?
[02:35:17.932 --> 02:35:20.654]  Isn't this always anticipated by the party?
[02:35:21.314 --> 02:35:22.355]  Yes, it's very important.
[02:35:22.395 --> 02:35:27.136]  The Family Research Council is one of the most esteemed groups among social conservatives, and rightfully so.
[02:35:27.156 --> 02:35:30.978]  They do a lot of great work, and they bring a lot of really great people to their convention.
[02:35:30.998 --> 02:35:39.681]  You had 2,300 really top social conservative activists at this thing, and between the on-the-ground voting and the online voting,
[02:35:40.041 --> 02:35:55.977]  Dr. Paul pulled in 15% and I think that speaks strongly because I think more and more social conservatives are turning on to the notion and the idea that the best way to protect their religious freedom and their traditional American values is limited government, keeping the federal government out of there.
[02:35:56.357 --> 02:36:00.020]  You know, the federal government's trying to tell our ministers what they can say from the pulpit.
[02:36:00.060 --> 02:36:03.382]  They're trying to tell us how social conservatives need to raise their children.
[02:36:03.723 --> 02:36:08.546]  So, the best way to protect their turf and their values and what they care about is limited government.
[02:36:08.606 --> 02:36:11.729]  And Ron Paul is the only candidate that's really talking about limited government.
[02:36:13.226 --> 02:36:29.235]  Also, people are saying that Mitt Romney may have stacked the deck with his people because he's waffled on abortion, and his scores aren't even very good, and so they think that even more of that may erode as social conservatives actually find out the straight scoop on Mitt.
[02:36:29.255 --> 02:36:34.678]  I mean, Ron, Paul, the doctor, the congressman, I mean, he's got the conservative record.
[02:36:34.718 --> 02:36:35.579]  He should have won.
[02:36:36.685 --> 02:36:50.149]  Yeah, I absolutely agree with you, and I think the more that people turn on and the more that people discover just how powerful limited government and the Constitution is at protecting their religious freedoms, the more that people are going to come to Dr. Paul.
[02:36:50.849 --> 02:36:56.570]  I'll admit, Mike Huckabee is very good at communicating with that kind of crowd.
[02:36:57.531 --> 02:37:01.972]  He was a Baptist minister for 20 years, and he really knows how to speak their language.
[02:37:02.392 --> 02:37:07.215]  He does share a lot of the social values, and he can be a very attractive candidate to them.
[02:37:07.275 --> 02:37:14.540]  So, you know, I think that it really, when it comes down to it, I think it's Dr. Paul and Governor Huckabee competing for that audience.
[02:37:15.001 --> 02:37:26.268]  And since I think that Dr. Paul, just based on fundraising and national grassroots support, is a much more viable candidate, I think as Governor Huckabee starts to fade away, I think that social conservatives are just going to flock to Ron.
[02:37:26.308 --> 02:37:27.209]  He's the only candidate.
[02:37:27.349 --> 02:37:27.609]  That's right.
[02:37:27.629 --> 02:37:33.131]  Huckabee was a very close second, so if you take his numbers and polls, he's going to win.
[02:37:33.151 --> 02:37:39.073]  I mean, Huckabee had 27.1, very close, right behind Romney, 27.6.
[02:37:39.113 --> 02:37:44.155]  You get 27 and 15, you're talking about a whopping victory for Ron Paul.
[02:37:44.355 --> 02:37:44.916]  Absolutely.
[02:37:45.296 --> 02:37:50.738]  And, you know, I just really think that when social conservatives really look at Mitt Romney's
[02:37:51.158 --> 02:37:55.082]  I think we both agree on who the real viable candidate for the long term is amongst those two.
[02:38:08.473 --> 02:38:11.775]  That's right, because he's anti-war and can get the Democrat and Liberal votes.
[02:38:11.835 --> 02:38:13.496]  He is the Libertarian.
[02:38:13.776 --> 02:38:20.380]  He's a Christian conservative, a veteran, a doctor, and he'll control and defend our borders and defend our currency.
[02:38:20.601 --> 02:38:22.222]  I mean, he covers every key issue.
[02:38:22.262 --> 02:38:23.823]  He didn't start this week or last month.
[02:38:24.043 --> 02:38:25.444]  He started 30-something years ago.
[02:38:25.524 --> 02:38:31.387]  Sure, and I don't want to discourage Governor Huckabee, but he doesn't have the best record amongst fiscal conservatives.
[02:38:31.467 --> 02:38:32.288]  He's a loser.
[02:38:32.708 --> 02:38:39.572]  He raised the Arkansas sales tax some 37 percent, raised the cigarette tax... These are fake!
[02:38:39.592 --> 02:38:48.056]  He's one of those... Look, I mean, you're not going to tell it like it is, and I understand you're being a good guy, but let's face it, he's one of these fake Christian conservatives.
[02:38:48.256 --> 02:38:51.337]  He's not a real conservative, and I'm tired of these fakes!
[02:38:51.838 --> 02:38:56.400]  Well, he's certainly not a fiscal conservative, and I'll defend that up and down.
[02:38:56.420 --> 02:39:02.243]  I think he's a good man, and I think he's got some good principles he stands on, but he's not a fiscal conservative, that's pretty clear.
[02:39:03.474 --> 02:39:06.838]  I like him a lot more than Rudolph Giuliani, but that's not saying much.
[02:39:06.858 --> 02:39:09.962]  I mean, talk about Giuliani being a dead duck.
[02:39:09.982 --> 02:39:11.063]  2% of the vote?
[02:39:12.104 --> 02:39:19.393]  Well, yeah, you know, social conservatives, they're just not finding their candidate in Rudy Giuliani.
[02:39:19.853 --> 02:39:23.976]  And if you just want to look at, you just want to stack the men up against each other.
[02:39:24.216 --> 02:39:42.209]  You know, Dr. Paul's been married to the same woman for 50 years, lives the values that he preaches, and Rudy Giuliani has his well-documented social problems, and I think it's just pretty clear who the better man and the better social conservative is amongst those two.
[02:39:43.847 --> 02:39:44.610]  Absolutely.
[02:39:44.630 --> 02:39:50.169]  I mean, it means something when your grown children won't talk to you.
[02:39:51.013 --> 02:40:05.948]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I hate to judge someone based on their social life or their personal life, on which I don't have full information, but you do make your personal life an open book when you decide to run for office, and based on the information we have, it doesn't paint a very good picture.
[02:40:05.968 --> 02:40:09.172]  Well, look, I mean, it's one thing if you've had a divorce.
[02:40:09.512 --> 02:40:10.793]  I mean, that happens.
[02:40:11.054 --> 02:40:12.335]  There's great people who've had divorces.
[02:40:12.535 --> 02:40:14.237]  But the point is, the family hates him.
[02:40:15.299 --> 02:40:26.026]  And he's a piece of crud, and I know we're done talking about Giuliani, it's just that any Republican that thinks he has any chance of beating Hillary, and even if he did, he's worse than her.
[02:40:26.106 --> 02:40:28.467]  I mean, it's hard to have this bad a candidate.
[02:40:28.688 --> 02:40:37.033]  Well, I can say this, just from some of the people that I've talked to, some big power players behind the scenes, even involved with other campaigns that I'm still friendly with,
[02:40:37.413 --> 02:40:46.362]  They say that the conservative wing of the Republican Party basically has one overall riding mission, and that is to make sure that Rudy Giuliani is not the nominee.
[02:40:46.763 --> 02:40:54.691]  I just don't see how he makes a viable candidate if you've got the real conservatives, the people that really care, the social conservatives, the fiscal conservatives.
[02:40:54.711 --> 02:40:55.832]  What does your data show?
[02:40:55.852 --> 02:40:58.595]  Does it show that social conservatives are about 60% of the party?
[02:41:00.056 --> 02:41:13.081]  Boy, you know, I don't know how to speculate exactly on that because, you know, how different people identify, but, you know, it has been proven that if you can't motivate the social conservative base to turn out in GOTV efforts, you're not going to win.
[02:41:13.241 --> 02:41:13.961]  They're the engine!
[02:41:14.801 --> 02:41:16.544]  Yeah, they're very much, they are the engine.
[02:41:16.764 --> 02:41:21.530]  They're organized, they're civically minded, you know, they just tend to really care.
[02:41:21.871 --> 02:41:27.379]  And if you can't get them to the polls a la 2006, you're not, you're not, Republicans are not going to do well.
[02:41:27.739 --> 02:41:31.765]  By the way, they are now turning their backs finally on the war and realizing they were lied to.
[02:41:32.285 --> 02:41:33.506]  Yeah, I think they are.
[02:41:33.686 --> 02:41:37.669]  And, you know, one aspect of being conservative is loyalty, Alex.
[02:41:37.849 --> 02:41:41.252]  And, you know, conservatives are naturally very loyal to their leaders.
[02:41:41.292 --> 02:41:47.757]  So it's taken conservatives a little longer than some others to really get their brain wrapped around just how bad this war is.
[02:41:47.897 --> 02:41:53.241]  But how many gay porn stars does Bush have to have in the White House till the Christian conservatives stop supporting?
[02:41:54.045 --> 02:41:56.047]  Well, I think you're seeing them stop.
[02:41:56.127 --> 02:41:57.388]  I think you're seeing a shift right now.
[02:41:57.428 --> 02:42:07.015]  I think you're seeing people really start to wake up to this thing and realize that it's bankrupting our future generations, it's been just a debacle, and that we need to get out.
[02:42:07.295 --> 02:42:15.562]  I think the loyalty has come from a good place for so long, but that loyalty, even amongst conservatives, has an end, and I think we're starting to hit that point right now.
[02:42:16.303 --> 02:42:20.805]  Talkin' to Jesse Benton from the RonPaul2008.com campaign.
[02:42:20.825 --> 02:42:27.768]  Tell us about the actual fundraising goal, the date it is, how people should give to make sure we get the amount.
[02:42:28.128 --> 02:42:30.569]  Well, right now, we have a goal.
[02:42:30.589 --> 02:42:33.110]  We want to raise about $3 million this month.
[02:42:33.470 --> 02:42:39.533]  We've raised about $1.7 million online so far, another couple hundred grand in checks.
[02:42:40.093 --> 02:42:45.677]  So, we're going to try to make a big push at the end of the month and get up to $3 million raised for the month of October.
[02:42:46.037 --> 02:42:50.199]  That would keep us on pace to continue to grow and raise $12 million for the quarter.
[02:42:50.659 --> 02:42:56.103]  Well, I've also heard you were talking earlier about a project Independent Supporters are putting together on November 5th.
[02:42:56.623 --> 02:43:05.108]  That sounds pretty interesting, and I can't really give too much information about that as it's not our project, but I think it's pretty readily available online.
[02:43:05.128 --> 02:43:06.209]  Yeah, what is it?
[02:43:06.289 --> 02:43:08.170]  Is it $14 or $18 million on November 5th?
[02:43:08.730 --> 02:43:09.351]  Boy, I don't know.
[02:43:09.411 --> 02:43:19.258]  I've heard anywhere from a million to ten million, but I heard they've got several thousand people signed up to give anywhere from $100,000 to $1,000 on November 5th in remembrance of Guy Fawkes Day.
[02:43:20.399 --> 02:43:23.702]  That would be a real cool boost to the campaign.
[02:43:23.722 --> 02:43:25.743]  I certainly encourage people to take a look at that.
[02:43:25.944 --> 02:43:32.929]  In the meantime, I encourage people to donate on our online portal right now on our webpage, RonPaul2008.com.
[02:43:34.304 --> 02:43:38.649]  You know, another thing too, Alex, I mean, it's been the fundraising that has gotten us all this earned media.
[02:43:38.669 --> 02:43:44.575]  I mean, Ron's going to be on tonight's show with Jay Leno on the 30th, Good Morning America, front page of the Washington Post.
[02:43:45.456 --> 02:43:47.017]  Just huge earned media we've been getting.
[02:43:47.237 --> 02:43:48.699]  Much more positive media too.
[02:43:48.959 --> 02:43:50.321]  And that is because of the fundraising.
[02:43:50.381 --> 02:43:55.306]  If we can keep this fundraising pace up, we can keep it growing like we anticipated, earned media will come too.
[02:43:55.646 --> 02:43:58.689]  Well, this is a Cinderella story.
[02:43:58.909 --> 02:44:01.371]  This is a come-from-behind underdog.
[02:44:01.511 --> 02:44:05.535]  I mean, when the mainstream media... What was the shift about a week and a half, two weeks ago?
[02:44:05.595 --> 02:44:09.238]  Suddenly, Fox, CNN, MSNBC said, he's first tier.
[02:44:09.358 --> 02:44:10.039]  He could win.
[02:44:10.059 --> 02:44:14.603]  I mean, think, he's come this far when they would laugh at him, ignore him, say he couldn't win.
[02:44:14.843 --> 02:44:16.685]  Now they're saying he can win.
[02:44:17.185 --> 02:44:26.147]  We better look for really sick dirt being manufactured, and I hope you guys have got some really serious people watching your campaign.
[02:44:26.527 --> 02:44:28.348]  I know you've got to have infiltration going on.
[02:44:28.668 --> 02:44:29.348]  I'm sure we do.
[02:44:29.808 --> 02:44:30.508]  I'm sure we do.
[02:44:30.548 --> 02:44:36.290]  We've got a lot of people that want to throw negative stuff at us right now, but we're working hard.
[02:44:36.330 --> 02:44:37.190]  We've got support.
[02:44:37.450 --> 02:44:42.271]  I'm parallel to support around the country, and of course, Dr. Paul is a man of extreme courage.
[02:44:42.912 --> 02:44:47.439]  Extreme inner strength and he's ready to carry the weight of all these attacks on his shoulders.
[02:44:48.743 --> 02:44:57.467]  Well, plus they bounce off because the guy is just incredibly humble and you can really get the vibe when you know him in person.
[02:44:58.067 --> 02:45:01.089]  I tell you, being humble is just such a powerful attribute.
[02:45:01.129 --> 02:45:03.450]  I'm trying to be more humble myself.
[02:45:03.830 --> 02:45:09.032]  It's kind of hard to do sometimes because I'm so young and still dumb, but it's just so amazing.
[02:45:09.252 --> 02:45:12.994]  What's it like getting to work around Ron Paul just day after day, week after week?
[02:45:13.494 --> 02:45:15.915]  I don't want this to sound corny, but it really is an honor.
[02:45:16.195 --> 02:45:22.197]  I realize how personally blessed I am to get to work for such an important cause, get to work for your hero.
[02:45:22.297 --> 02:45:24.258]  I'm no one special.
[02:45:24.418 --> 02:45:26.299]  I just happen to be in the right place at the right time.
[02:45:26.319 --> 02:45:31.141]  There are dozens of people that have the same skills as me and can do an equally good job.
[02:45:31.341 --> 02:45:34.342]  I just realize how blessed I am to be around someone with just so much integrity.
[02:45:34.730 --> 02:45:49.601]  I mean, when you're feeling a little flustered, a little stressed out, all you have to do is just kind of sit back and just think for a minute about Ron, what he's doing, what he's done for 30 years, what he's taken upon himself, and all that just goes away.
[02:45:49.681 --> 02:45:50.921]  It's just the ultimate motivation.
[02:45:51.042 --> 02:45:55.565]  Plus, he's 72 years old, working the schedule that would kill a 25-year-old.
[02:45:55.745 --> 02:45:55.985]  I know.
[02:45:56.005 --> 02:46:00.248]  Well, he's 72, he looks 52, and he acts like he's 42.
[02:46:00.728 --> 02:46:02.610]  He's got just incredible personal energy.
[02:46:02.670 --> 02:46:04.211]  He's amazingly healthy and fit.
[02:46:04.682 --> 02:46:08.024]  I tell you, there's nothing more embarrassing than when he and I are walking to an interview.
[02:46:08.084 --> 02:46:11.266]  I'm 30 years old, Alex, and I'm not too unfit.
[02:46:11.286 --> 02:46:18.030]  I used to be a little bit of an athlete, and we're walking along, and I'm having to jog to keep up with him walking because he's walking so fast.
[02:46:18.070 --> 02:46:22.033]  That is pretty embarrassing when your 72-year-old boss is smoking you down the hallway.
[02:46:22.916 --> 02:46:25.457]  No, I mean, look, he's presidential material.
[02:46:25.817 --> 02:46:27.517]  He is founding father material.
[02:46:27.818 --> 02:46:36.680]  We, I mean, but it's, God's giving us Ron Paul at this key juncture with all this evil rising against this country, with the country in so much economic trouble, so much military trouble.
[02:46:37.120 --> 02:46:38.781]  I mean, America is being offered
[02:46:39.461 --> 02:46:41.022]  Well, I sure hope so, Alex.
[02:46:57.807 --> 02:46:58.928]  I'd make a bold prediction.
[02:46:59.448 --> 02:47:06.330]  If we do, and if America embraces Ron, as I hope that they do, and as we need to do, in 50 years there are going to be statues of Ron Paul.
[02:47:06.390 --> 02:47:15.634]  Ron Paul is going to be on, well, he's going to be on, hopefully, gold minted coins or gold-backed currency that the United States is enjoying.
[02:47:16.014 --> 02:47:17.354]  He's going to be in textbooks.
[02:47:17.394 --> 02:47:19.055]  He's going to be talked about with Alexa.
[02:47:22.198 --> 02:47:30.729]  Well, we talked about the danger and he says he knows he's in danger as he gets bigger and bigger, but he knows that if they do do something, God forbid, that that even makes him even bigger.
[02:47:31.815 --> 02:47:42.623]  Yeah, well, the danger factor is something I try not to think about too much, because it is a little scary, but you can't live your life based on fear.
[02:47:42.943 --> 02:47:44.684]  We can't run this campaign based on fear.
[02:47:45.084 --> 02:47:49.848]  And again, Ron is extremely brave, has incredible courage and conviction, and that carries him forward.
[02:47:50.488 --> 02:47:55.309]  In closing, did you see the Rupert Murdoch papers claiming that it's still a fake campaign last week?
[02:47:55.329 --> 02:47:56.869]  Oh, I missed that one.
[02:47:57.189 --> 02:47:59.510]  They're saying that again, aren't they?
[02:47:59.550 --> 02:48:03.651]  I mean, how can we have more MySpace people than any other, all the candidates combined?
[02:48:03.851 --> 02:48:10.352]  You should go talk to some of our 60,000 meetup group members across the country that are actively engaged in grassroots sport.
[02:48:10.372 --> 02:48:16.853]  I mean, all these signs and sign waving and literature being handed out, that's not just coming by itself.
[02:48:17.725 --> 02:48:19.767]  Jesse Benton, thank you for all your great work.
[02:48:19.787 --> 02:48:20.527]  We're praying for you.
[02:48:20.568 --> 02:48:21.328]  We salute you.
[02:48:21.728 --> 02:48:23.750]  I look forward to talking to other great folks from the campaign.
[02:48:23.770 --> 02:48:26.472]  Mike, congratulations to all of you, and Godspeed.
[02:48:26.633 --> 02:48:27.674]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:48:28.194 --> 02:48:29.195]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:48:29.275 --> 02:48:30.015]  Great people.
[02:48:30.356 --> 02:48:34.960]  And they haven't turned their back on us, even though the media has tried to make a big issue out of it, because they're loyal.
[02:48:35.440 --> 02:48:36.261]  And we're loyal to them.
[02:48:36.281 --> 02:48:37.602]  We're loyal to Dr. Paul.
[02:48:37.902 --> 02:48:39.283]  And I know you're loyal to him as well.
[02:48:39.764 --> 02:48:40.564]  I salute you.
[02:48:42.406 --> 02:48:43.807]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:44.888 --> 02:48:45.889]  A new world order.
[02:48:46.619 --> 02:48:51.820]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:51.860 --> 02:48:53.661]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:54.321 --> 02:48:56.582]  Both their objective being world domination.
[02:48:57.122 --> 02:48:59.582]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:00.303 --> 02:49:07.625]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:10.655 --> 02:49:15.639]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:16.119 --> 02:49:19.581]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:19.982 --> 02:49:22.483]  Bill Burdick is making great progress for the world government.
[02:49:22.543 --> 02:49:23.704]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:23.724 --> 02:49:24.465]  They're not after money.
[02:49:24.485 --> 02:49:25.565]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:25.766 --> 02:49:26.486]  They're after policy.
[02:49:26.746 --> 02:49:27.867]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:51:40.029 --> 02:51:47.472]  Or do you feel the same?
[02:51:48.272 --> 02:51:53.274]  Will it make it easier on you now?
[02:52:08.511 --> 02:52:10.132]  You've got someone to blame.
[02:52:11.793 --> 02:52:21.658]  You said one love, one life, when it's one need in the night.
[02:52:23.459 --> 02:52:25.820]  One love, we get to share it.
[02:52:27.561 --> 02:52:31.183]  It leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it.
[02:52:44.458 --> 02:52:46.218]  Did I disappoint you?
[02:52:48.679 --> 02:52:53.641]  Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
[02:52:54.201 --> 02:52:56.602]  You act like you never had love.
[02:52:59.023 --> 02:53:01.344]  And you want me to go without.
[02:53:01.464 --> 02:53:03.464]  Ha ha, no sir, I'm not going without.
[02:53:04.245 --> 02:53:05.005]  Too late.
[02:53:06.061 --> 02:53:09.184]  Tonight!
[02:53:09.244 --> 02:53:20.275]  Yeah, I gotta tell ya, I think Johnny Cash does a lot better job singin' one than you two does in a little U.N.
[02:53:20.335 --> 02:53:22.077]  minion Bono of Bono.
[02:53:22.237 --> 02:53:23.799]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:53:25.157 --> 02:53:29.679]  There's an incredible article on Infowars.net, prisonpanda.com, as well as jonesreport.com.
[02:53:30.040 --> 02:53:35.362]  Beck, 9-11 troopers, insane, dangerous anarchists, the kind of group Timothy McVeigh would come from.
[02:53:35.763 --> 02:53:38.884]  CNN host lays in a truth movement in vicious attack.
[02:53:39.264 --> 02:53:51.771]  CNN host Glenn Beck viciously attacked a 9-11 truth movement last night on his headline, Prime Show, which has horrible ratings, he's a total loser, describing the whole movement as insane and branding 9-11 activists as dangerous anarchists.
[02:53:53.653 --> 02:53:59.078]  Beck signaled out 9-11 Truthers in a segment in response to the infiltration in Realtown with Bill Maher.
[02:53:59.218 --> 02:54:00.959]  We are changed protesters last week.
[02:54:01.259 --> 02:54:03.741]  Bill Maher to be thanking people for all the attention he's getting.
[02:54:04.262 --> 02:54:14.370]  In a piece that would normally associate with the Fair and Balanced Fox News, Beck featured two guests who both argued against 9-11 Truth, as well as throwing in his own two cents.
[02:54:14.691 --> 02:54:17.273]  But they had a poll, and right now it's over 80 percent.
[02:54:17.313 --> 02:54:20.195]  Earlier it was 60-something percent in the first hour.
[02:54:21.436 --> 02:54:22.317]  So go vote in the poll.
[02:54:23.502 --> 02:54:25.783]  But he's telling his people to all go vote in it.
[02:54:26.123 --> 02:54:29.745]  He sells them for 20 minutes attacking, and then says, go vote, and he fails.
[02:54:35.507 --> 02:54:40.249]  By the way, 9-11's only one salvo in their ongoing attack.
[02:54:40.269 --> 02:54:46.991]  We're going to be showing endgame for the big picture, and what the big brass ring is they're going after at the end of the road.
[02:54:49.012 --> 02:54:51.353]  And it is so important.
[02:54:52.501 --> 02:54:55.243]  For everybody out there.
[02:54:55.524 --> 02:54:57.646]  By the way, I'm about to be on South African Radio in 30 minutes.
[02:54:58.066 --> 02:55:03.711]  I'm going to tell Aaron, just at JonesReport.com, to put a link to their station in Cape Town.
[02:55:05.452 --> 02:55:06.393]  It's a big, big show.
[02:55:07.734 --> 02:55:08.735]  So you can tune into that.
[02:55:08.755 --> 02:55:11.197]  I'm going to put a link on JonesReport.com.
[02:55:11.237 --> 02:55:15.201]  In 30 minutes, you can tune in and listen to me in Cape Town and be like, that's kind of cool.
[02:55:17.197 --> 02:55:19.179]  We might crash their servers though, but who knows.
[02:55:19.980 --> 02:55:22.782]  That'll be up on JonesReport.com in the next 15 minutes.
[02:55:22.802 --> 02:55:24.683]  You can find the link and tune into that.
[02:55:24.784 --> 02:55:33.291]  Or if you missed any of the first hour where I got into what's happening with the dollar, what's going on when I ran into Willie Nelson last night, I talk about that the first of the show.
[02:55:33.331 --> 02:55:34.432]  It starts again in about
[02:55:36.098 --> 02:55:37.678]  A minute and a half at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:37.938 --> 02:55:43.239]  If you missed that, we re-stream in 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com consecutively with a podcast.
[02:55:43.479 --> 02:55:48.820]  I'll be out at the Gallimau Draft House tonight, 7 o'clock, giving a speech.
[02:55:48.840 --> 02:55:54.341]  7 o'clock this evening of our End Game, and then it shows again tomorrow, and then we take off a week and it shows three more times again.
[02:55:54.641 --> 02:55:57.002]  I want to see you tonight there at End Game.
[02:55:57.282 --> 02:56:01.482]  Hits the web at PrisonPlanet.tv in two and a half days.
[02:56:01.682 --> 02:56:03.183]  Thursday night it goes up.

[02:56:13.818 --> 02:56:15.099]  It ships on Monday.
