[00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:06.210]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.931]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.631 --> 00:00:09.772]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.393 --> 00:00:11.233]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:12.954]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.535 --> 00:00:17.198]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.738 --> 00:00:21.821]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.762 --> 00:00:41.824]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this Wednesday, the 21st day of February 2007.
[00:00:42.344 --> 00:00:46.545]  We'll be here with you live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:50.346]  You don't want to miss any of the broadcast coming up in the middle of the second hour.
[00:00:50.366 --> 00:00:54.347]  We'll be getting into a move in New Mexico that looks like it may pass.
[00:00:56.977 --> 00:01:00.179]  to start impeachment proceedings at the state level.
[00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:09.303]  That's another way that impeachment can be triggered against the lying puppet-in-chief, George W. Bush.
[00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:24.350]  We also have Dr. Deagle joining us, Bill Deagle of Genesis Communications, to talk about the bird flu, is it coming or isn't it, all the hype surrounding that, the Merck vaccine, and so much more.
[00:01:25.589 --> 00:01:30.170]  We'll have open phones throughout the broadcast, but the really good news, there's a lot of good news today.
[00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.591]  Merck ends push for mandatory shots for girls.
[00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:36.932]  At least it's good news on the surface.
[00:01:36.952 --> 00:01:37.772]  We'll break it down.
[00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:40.673]  The Merck CEO is stepping down.
[00:01:41.973 --> 00:01:45.374]  Merck is suspending lobbying for the vaccine.
[00:01:47.811 --> 00:01:53.913]  But Perry, Governor Rick Perry, stands by the live cancer virus vaccine.
[00:01:54.233 --> 00:02:03.516]  So we'll be breaking down that entire new chapter in the fight against forced inoculation with live viruses.
[00:02:05.564 --> 00:02:14.310]  In other news, Christine Ebersole has been in national television shows, big roles in major movies.
[00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:21.475]  She has a top Broadway hit that she produces and stars in right now on Broadway in New York.
[00:02:22.811 --> 00:02:35.316]  And about two weeks ago, she went on The View national television show on ABC, swooning over Genesis Communications' own John Connor, who does a Sunday night radio show.
[00:02:35.836 --> 00:02:40.117]  He's now doing a weekday show on the Genesis World Report with four other co-hosts.
[00:02:40.497 --> 00:02:42.098]  It's a great roundtable program.
[00:02:44.011 --> 00:02:48.013]  And I never bothered to call John and find out if he was trying to get in touch with her.
[00:02:49.734 --> 00:02:50.934]  I didn't try to contact her.
[00:02:50.974 --> 00:02:59.658]  I should have, because now I've learned that she's a fan of this show, a fan of my documentary films, and that's one of the things that led her into 9-11 Truth and into John's work.
[00:03:00.078 --> 00:03:05.701]  And John got her successfully to come on his Sunday night program he does, his one-hour news report.
[00:03:06.301 --> 00:03:06.742]  Yes, we are.
[00:03:26.138 --> 00:03:27.179]  Ten, I would say.
[00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:36.365]  Nine out of ten comments are extremely positive, mirroring the national polls we've seen, where 80-plus percent of the American people believe they're being lied to about 9-11.
[00:03:36.925 --> 00:03:43.930]  But she's the first prominent woman to go public who is in the whole Hollywood-slash-New York scene.
[00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:54.317]  She's very articulate, and she went further than Charlie Sheen or David Lynch or Ed Asner or many other Hollywood folks that have now gone public.
[00:03:55.443 --> 00:04:00.209]  No, she came right out and said total inside job, Silverstein pulled it.
[00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:12.162]  We're going to play a 10-minute excerpt that John Connor edited out of his hour-long interview with her coming up at the bottom of this hour in about 25 minutes from now.
[00:04:12.262 --> 00:04:14.484]  We'll break down that story for you.
[00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:19.067]  More good news and bad news, but good news that more people are going public.
[00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:21.729]  The dam on the 9-11 cover-up is breaking.
[00:04:22.209 --> 00:04:24.390]  Also more fabulous news today.
[00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.473]  Oregon Senate introduces anti-NAU, North American Union, resolution.
[00:04:31.374 --> 00:04:32.314]  Bad news, though.
[00:04:32.734 --> 00:04:41.939]  The neocons, like Cliff Kincaid, who poses as an anti-New World Order person, comes out with North American Union conspiracy exposed.
[00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.060]  Why, he just discovered it!
[00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:46.127]  And it's all the Democrats, of course.
[00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:49.248]  And more good news.
[00:04:49.528 --> 00:04:54.531]  Some even bigger good news that we'll tell you about on the other side.
[00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:57.072]  Impeachment in New Mexico.
[00:04:58.072 --> 00:04:59.933]  Iraq troop withdrawals.
[00:05:04.352 --> 00:05:09.821]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:17.773]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:18.522 --> 00:05:25.567]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:25.967 --> 00:05:37.375]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.696 --> 00:05:41.158]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:41.638 --> 00:05:43.640]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.783]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:00.931 --> 00:06:09.178]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.802]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:23.011]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.814]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:06:27.114 --> 00:06:32.159]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:39.145]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:06:39.648 --> 00:06:40.308]  What about you?
[00:06:40.948 --> 00:06:46.310]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:47.450]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.531]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:54.012]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:07:15.882 --> 00:07:16.122]  We're good.
[00:07:31.255 --> 00:07:31.695]  I think so.
[00:08:02.407 --> 00:08:08.436]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.057 --> 00:08:12.041]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:29.233 --> 00:08:44.420]  Not only is the state of New Mexico on the verge of moving for impeachment proceedings against the President of the United States, we have the British now announcing a timetable.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.821]  Now we'll see if this is a stunt.
[00:08:47.071 --> 00:08:48.311]  to pull their troops out.
[00:08:48.391 --> 00:09:16.477]  But even if it's a stunt, it shows that with now 90 percent, and we have the polls, it's 78 here in the U.S., with 90 percent in British polls on average, it's in the high 80s, early 90s depending on which poll you look at, scientific polls, wanting their troops home, knowing the war is a fraud, that's going to make it a lot harder for the Brits to help the globalists launch an attack on Iran,
[00:09:18.138 --> 00:09:27.561]  And it shows, now that they've had to set a timetable for total withdrawal, it shows that they're having to respond to the people's will.
[00:09:30.402 --> 00:09:35.624]  And on issue after issue after issue, we see the New World Order crumbling, we see them failing.
[00:09:36.564 --> 00:09:47.408]  All over the nation, legislatures are considering introducing legislation right now, from the state of Texas to Oregon, and Oregon has now done it,
[00:09:48.251 --> 00:09:52.375]  to have state resolutions against the North American Union.
[00:09:53.576 --> 00:10:10.291]  36 states, it was 32 two weeks ago, 36 states are now introducing legislation and several have passed laws refusing to go along with the National ID Card Act, known as Real ID.
[00:10:11.926 --> 00:10:13.528]  And there's so many other issues.
[00:10:13.668 --> 00:10:20.336]  States are taking action to block their cities from being sanctuary cities for illegal aliens.
[00:10:20.616 --> 00:10:23.019]  The 800 plus sanctuary cities.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:31.028]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, Merck has ended its push for mandatory shots for girls.
[00:10:33.072 --> 00:10:36.714]  Merck is suspending its entire lobbying effort.
[00:10:37.154 --> 00:10:42.798]  Merck's CEO is also retiring after 17 years stepping down.
[00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:50.322]  And there's clear indicators that because there was no pre-announcement or build-up as there would normally be with retirement, that no, she's stepping down.
[00:10:50.662 --> 00:10:53.384]  She's stepping down in the very immediate future.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:57.941]  But Rick Perry, arrogant, only got what?
[00:10:58.302 --> 00:11:01.043]  33% of the vote in the state of Texas?
[00:11:01.083 --> 00:11:03.764]  An open border gun control advocate?
[00:11:04.324 --> 00:11:06.885]  A total piece of blackmailed slime?
[00:11:06.905 --> 00:11:10.647]  They blackmail him with all the skeletons he's got in his closet?
[00:11:11.427 --> 00:11:15.309]  The guy ramming through the North American Union, the trans-Texas corridors?
[00:11:16.704 --> 00:11:24.507]  The NAFTA superhighway, the man handing over our infrastructure to the Dutch and the British and the Germans and the Arabs and the Spanish.
[00:11:26.008 --> 00:11:31.510]  The creature says he doesn't care, he's still going forward with it.
[00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:32.531]  And you know why?
[00:11:32.591 --> 00:11:38.313]  Because he's on their payroll, up one side and down the other, and by one state,
[00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:47.005]  Saying it's mandated that kicks in the federal immunity from damage from this vaccine.
[00:11:47.605 --> 00:12:01.337]  We spent two hours with three guests, a victim, and then we also had the president of the Texas-based Eagle Forum, that branch, the Eagle Forum, and Mr. Papantonio, the expert trial lawyer who's litigated against these individuals.
[00:12:02.038 --> 00:12:05.741]  So let's go through the Merck news first, then we'll go through all the other good news.
[00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:13.109]  Merck ends push for mandatory shots for girls, this out of the New York Times today.
[00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:32.433]  Reacting to a furor in public health circles, that's right, doctors and medical experts, saying don't take it, it's very dangerous and all the adverse reactions that were coming out, and reacting to shows like this one and the threats of lawsuits,
[00:12:33.155 --> 00:12:51.996]  Reacting to a furor in public health circles, Merck said Thursday, Tuesday, today's Wednesday, that it would stop trying to get state legislatures to mandate the use of its new cervical cancer vaccine.
[00:12:52.694 --> 00:13:04.140]  At least 20 states are considering making use of the vaccine mandatory for schoolgirls and the governor of Texas Rick Perry has already done so through an executive order.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:17.386]  Part of the state rush to embrace the new vaccine has been fueled by Merck lobbying that began even before federal regulators approved the product last year.
[00:13:18.667 --> 00:13:21.168]  Now let's just analyze those first two paragraphs.
[00:13:22.578 --> 00:13:27.643]  It says making use of the vaccine mandatory for schoolgirls.
[00:13:28.124 --> 00:13:33.810]  And it goes on to say Texas Governor Rick Perry has already done so through an executive order.
[00:13:35.011 --> 00:13:38.955]  Now I know I've been parroting this now for the last month since the story broke big time.
[00:13:41.118 --> 00:13:53.330]  And for listeners who are tired of hearing me say this, I'm sorry, we have to warn all the new listeners that just tuned in that are driving down the road in Illinois or New York or Kansas or Missouri or Texas or Southern California.
[00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:57.854]  There is no law anywhere in the U.S.
[00:13:57.914 --> 00:14:00.377]  that anyone has to take vaccines.
[00:14:01.428 --> 00:14:08.958]  There are recommendations that it be added to the state health department's list of recommended.
[00:14:09.379 --> 00:14:16.969]  Then the schools say they have a policy that you have to take the shots to attend school.
[00:14:17.129 --> 00:14:17.770]  No law.
[00:14:18.642 --> 00:14:31.726]  And then states have had to pass laws, because the school's kicking people out, stating that no, the school has to give you a waiver, but still that's all procedural, and the courts of the world, you don't even have to file that.
[00:14:32.847 --> 00:14:43.270]  Where criminal penalties kick in is when they fraudulently and criminally racketeer, because they're getting funds to do this from state and federal and private interest,
[00:14:44.446 --> 00:14:50.531]  When they get 98% or higher inoculation in a school, massive funds kick in.
[00:14:51.331 --> 00:14:57.676]  So they're panicking over the fact that in some schools, upwards of 30% of the students are not vaccinated.
[00:14:58.917 --> 00:15:00.278]  Because the word is out.
[00:15:00.418 --> 00:15:04.862]  So this is a giant fraud, a huge hoax.
[00:15:05.702 --> 00:15:07.664]  Listeners, tell everyone
[00:15:09.275 --> 00:15:11.336]  Print off the vaccine waiver forms.
[00:15:11.416 --> 00:15:13.557]  Print off the news articles exposing this.
[00:15:13.657 --> 00:15:26.864]  Tell people that have children because they're having massive autoimmune responses, bleeding, Crohn's disease, horrible things, seizures.
[00:15:27.757 --> 00:15:40.903]  When people take this shot, and it's been the same thing with a bunch of other vaccines, because they're filled with viruses and DNA fragments, and they go into the gut, and they cause all sorts of problems.
[00:15:40.923 --> 00:15:52.128]  They go into the brain, they go into the organs, they go into the vascular structure, into the capillaries and arterioles, and into the arteries and veins, and they cause massive problems.
[00:15:52.469 --> 00:15:53.549]  There have been so many trips.
[00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:55.090]  I've interviewed so many fathers and mothers.
[00:15:55.450 --> 00:16:02.736]  Who's son takes the anthrax shot, and a week later, turns into a soup, and it looks like they died from Ebola.
[00:16:03.196 --> 00:16:06.138]  And the Army says, yep, the vaccine killed you, sorry!
[00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:11.663]  I mean, you're gonna take stuff that can make you bleed out, like an Ebola victim?
[00:16:12.341 --> 00:16:13.381]  I mean, that's what happens.
[00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:25.564]  Blood starts pouring out your nose, pouring out every place where you ever had a cut in your life, opens up like accelerated scurvy, blood starts pouring out of every orifice, pouring out of your ears, pouring out of your hide-in.
[00:16:26.984 --> 00:16:27.584]  You want that?
[00:16:27.624 --> 00:16:31.845]  How many newscasts have I played where the troops bleed out, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:16:32.345 --> 00:16:34.425]  You're going to go take shots where you bleed out?
[00:16:34.945 --> 00:16:37.806]  You want to turn into a mass of jello?
[00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:40.907]  And they have total immunity.
[00:16:41.127 --> 00:16:43.607]  The vaccine makers do not get in any trouble.
[00:16:46.208 --> 00:16:50.490]  Well, the word got out on this, and you watch, Merkel will be back in a few months.
[00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:56.792]  They know there's a huge crest of opposition and anger from state legislatures, governors, Republicans, Democrats.
[00:16:57.072 --> 00:16:58.352]  People are hopping mad.
[00:16:59.413 --> 00:17:00.653]  It's all over television.
[00:17:01.667 --> 00:17:04.548]  And so they're claiming now they're going to cease lobbying.
[00:17:05.009 --> 00:17:06.629]  I don't believe that for 10 seconds.
[00:17:06.649 --> 00:17:08.190]  They're going to pull back for a few months.
[00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.152]  We're going to be waiting for them, continuing our education process.
[00:17:12.472 --> 00:17:16.154]  And when they come back out, and you watch, they will, we'll be there exposing them.
[00:17:16.454 --> 00:17:17.334]  Take the state of Texas.
[00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:19.795]  Perry says he doesn't care if they're, quote, ceasing lobbying.
[00:17:20.116 --> 00:17:25.238]  He's going to continue lying and saying it's the law that you've got to take this.
[00:17:27.703 --> 00:17:28.243]  Listen to this.
[00:17:28.283 --> 00:17:31.944]  The vaccine is aimed at the sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical cancer.
[00:17:32.804 --> 00:17:33.664]  But there's a problem.
[00:17:33.704 --> 00:17:39.445]  It only covers four of the 127 papillomaviruses that can cause cancer.
[00:17:39.765 --> 00:17:40.966]  It doesn't even help you.
[00:17:41.246 --> 00:17:46.447]  These young women think they've got protection now, and they're going to run out and have unsafe sex.
[00:17:49.307 --> 00:17:51.288]  And it's all unsafe, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:52.128 --> 00:17:53.868]  Condoms break, condoms come off.
[00:17:54.488 --> 00:17:57.309]  I don't want to go off into a whole VD dissertation here.
[00:17:58.232 --> 00:18:03.055]  uh... but uh... that armor's got plenty of chinks in it.
[00:18:03.776 --> 00:18:07.058]  Merck suspends lobbying for vaccines out of the Associated Press.
[00:18:07.178 --> 00:18:16.364]  Merck & Co, bowing to pressure from parents and medical groups, is immediately suspending its lobbying campaign to persuade state legislatures.
[00:18:16.764 --> 00:18:19.826]  But by the way, neocon websites say I'm lying.
[00:18:20.286 --> 00:18:23.628]  There's no lobbying because Perry's a Republican.
[00:18:24.249 --> 00:18:25.509]  It must be a lie.
[00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:26.450]  I'm a dirty liberal.
[00:18:28.689 --> 00:18:30.810]  Mm-hmm, yeah.
[00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:44.894]  Bowing to pressure from parents and medical groups, Merck is immediately suspending its lobbying campaign to persuade state legislators to mandate that adolescent girls get the company's new vaccine against cervical cancer as a requirement for school attendance.
[00:18:46.454 --> 00:18:49.775]  And again, the hoax that you've got to take vaccines is in that article.
[00:18:51.075 --> 00:18:53.136]  This is a supposed anti-Merck article.
[00:18:53.216 --> 00:18:53.736]  No, it's not.
[00:18:55.268 --> 00:19:10.688]  I mean that is criminal to have a company come in and lobby and pay money to have the government come out and try to bluff you into taking something that at the bare minimum doesn't even protect you and on the bad side makes you bleed out like somebody who's got Ebola.
[00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:20.667]  The drug maker which announced the change Tuesday had been criticized for quietly funding the campaign via a third party.
[00:19:21.108 --> 00:19:22.348]  See how they use shill groups?
[00:19:22.969 --> 00:19:23.829]  Women in government.
[00:19:24.190 --> 00:19:32.375]  To require 11 and 12 year old girls, by the way it was really 9, old girls to get three dose vaccine in order to attend school.
[00:19:32.956 --> 00:19:37.439]  And it is in the news now that each regimen they're now saying
[00:19:38.507 --> 00:19:40.828]  We'll be upwards of three hundred dollars.
[00:19:40.868 --> 00:19:42.268]  What's three times three hundred?
[00:19:42.748 --> 00:19:45.329]  Nine hundred smackers.
[00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:54.651]  Nine hundred dollars to take something that there's a good chance is going to ruin your girl's life.
[00:19:55.631 --> 00:19:57.871]  Let me tell you, they're still going to line up for it, folks.
[00:19:58.552 --> 00:20:00.252]  These parents are totally evil.
[00:20:02.338 --> 00:20:03.319]  Good morning, honey.
[00:20:03.659 --> 00:20:09.665]  Wow, the weather is beautiful, the cabin is terrific, and it's the first day of our vacation!
[00:20:09.945 --> 00:20:10.546]  Yeah.
[00:20:10.946 --> 00:20:12.367]  Honey, is there something wrong?
[00:20:12.728 --> 00:20:16.131]  Yeah, I just realized we forgot to pack the travel brookie system.
[00:20:16.591 --> 00:20:18.093]  I can't drink this cabin water.
[00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:20.235]  And what am I going to do when I'm out on the lake?
[00:20:20.615 --> 00:20:22.377]  Now the whole vacation is ruined.
[00:20:22.597 --> 00:20:23.498]  Honey, cheer up!
[00:20:23.859 --> 00:20:26.122]  I brought our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:20:26.402 --> 00:20:26.703]  What?
[00:20:27.143 --> 00:20:37.618]  Yeah, I know you're picky about not having pathogenic bacteria, organic chemicals, heavy metals or foul tastes and odors in the water, so I packed our Sport Berkey Purifiers!
[00:20:37.918 --> 00:20:38.159]  You know?
[00:20:38.599 --> 00:20:40.060]  This is a terrific cabin!
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:41.141]  And, wow!
[00:20:41.321 --> 00:20:42.762]  Have you noticed the beautiful weather?
[00:20:43.063 --> 00:20:44.244]  Don't ruin your vacation.

[00:20:48.827 --> 00:20:50.449]  Travel Berkey now available in Iowa.
[00:20:50.529 --> 00:20:51.389]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:51.469 --> 00:20:52.430]  Here for the 2007 Red Book.
[00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:12.992]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:13.193 --> 00:21:15.935]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:17.075]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:18.436 --> 00:21:23.039]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:31.225]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[00:21:32.226 --> 00:21:35.268]  Midas Resources is offering the red buck and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[00:21:37.418 --> 00:21:40.882]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[00:21:41.843 --> 00:21:43.124]  Call for your copy today.
[00:21:43.364 --> 00:21:45.586]  It's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:46.648 --> 00:21:52.494]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[00:21:53.194 --> 00:21:53.595]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.615 --> 00:21:53.835]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:00.945 --> 00:22:03.386]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:03.907 --> 00:22:13.612]  Did you know that in 1975, 32 senators and 92 representatives signed the Declaration of Interdependence, which stated that we must bring about a new world order?
[00:22:13.792 --> 00:22:18.375]  It called for the surrender of our national sovereignty to international organizations.
[00:22:18.575 --> 00:22:23.658]  It called for the redistribution of the wealth from America to third and fourth world countries.
[00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:33.037]  This is the same New World Order call for by former President George Herbert Walter Bush 210 times at the start of the Iraqi War 1990-1991.
[00:22:35.683 --> 00:22:43.428]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:22:44.069 --> 00:22:45.530]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:45.910]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:46.210]  Call now.
[00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:49.052]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:23:02.005 --> 00:23:04.047]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:04.688 --> 00:23:13.597]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:14.057 --> 00:23:21.265]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:21.977 --> 00:23:27.462]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:27.963 --> 00:23:38.793]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:39.533 --> 00:23:41.595]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:23:42.116 --> 00:23:43.537]  For more information, call 702-953-0278.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:47.140]  We're good.
[00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:31.035]  Welcome back.
[00:24:33.796 --> 00:24:34.896]  I could spend all day on this.
[00:24:34.956 --> 00:24:36.556]  I'm not going to do it.
[00:24:36.576 --> 00:24:40.998]  We're going to open the phones up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:41.018 --> 00:24:46.479]  The websites are InfoWars.com, JonesReport.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:52.201]  But Merck is saying they're suspending all their lobbying, which is tens of millions of dollars worth.
[00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:56.193]  The Merck CEO is retiring after 17 years.
[00:24:57.795 --> 00:25:03.281]  She was a key figure in 2005 with the corporate restructuring after the Vioxx disaster.
[00:25:04.531 --> 00:25:09.095]  And they clearly plan to use this mandated hoax vaccine.
[00:25:09.395 --> 00:25:09.915]  It's a hoax.
[00:25:09.955 --> 00:25:11.557]  It doesn't help you with the cancer.
[00:25:12.117 --> 00:25:15.200]  It's a hoax in that it's very dangerous.
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.022]  It's a hoax in that it's the law that you have to take it.
[00:25:18.042 --> 00:25:18.762]  That's not true.
[00:25:19.263 --> 00:25:20.684]  Hoax, hoax, hoax, hoax, hoax, hoax.
[00:25:20.724 --> 00:25:21.445]  It's everything hoax.
[00:25:21.705 --> 00:25:22.445]  Everything staged.
[00:25:23.006 --> 00:25:25.268]  As usual, these people thinking we're a bunch of idiots.
[00:25:26.188 --> 00:25:31.733]  And now it's imploding around them, but in closing, Rick Perry says he's not going to stop.
[00:25:32.153 --> 00:25:33.034]  You're going to take it.
[00:25:34.597 --> 00:25:40.742]  Come hell or high water, Perry stands by anti-cancer vaccine mandate.
[00:25:41.442 --> 00:25:54.633]  Governor Rick Perry defended his executive order requiring 6th grade girls to be vaccinated against the virus that causes most cases of cervical cancer, saying Tuesday that he believes with all my heart that he was right.
[00:25:55.574 --> 00:26:00.998]  I do not understand why people would not take this opportunity to use this vaccine to the benefit of our children.
[00:26:02.242 --> 00:26:04.524]  He does believe with all his heart that it's the right decision.
[00:26:05.405 --> 00:26:08.948]  Governor Perry's executive order was not about a company.
[00:26:09.249 --> 00:26:13.012]  It was about saving lives and preventing women from contracting cancer.
[00:26:13.293 --> 00:26:19.338]  Perry's spokeswoman, Krista Moody, said after the announcement,
[00:26:22.702 --> 00:26:32.886]  Continuing here, on Monday, House lawmakers in Austin held a lengthy hearing to take testimony on Perry's mandate and left early Tuesday without taking action on a bill that would override Perry's order.
[00:26:33.386 --> 00:26:35.207]  And that's a show that doesn't really do that either.
[00:26:35.687 --> 00:26:41.609]  Many of the committee members raised questions about the vaccine's safety, efficacy, and cost.
[00:26:42.907 --> 00:26:52.371]  For the life of me, when the CDC and other experts come forward and say that it's safe, it's been tested, and it's available, why in the world would we not make it available?
[00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:53.072]  Perry said.
[00:26:53.192 --> 00:26:53.512]  Okay.
[00:26:53.852 --> 00:27:00.775]  Well, the CDC hasn't said it's completely safe, and neither has the FDA, and neither have the different watchdog groups.
[00:27:01.855 --> 00:27:02.736]  It's real simple.
[00:27:02.836 --> 00:27:05.177]  We don't believe anything you say anymore.
[00:27:05.197 --> 00:27:06.237]  Do you understand that, punk?
[00:27:06.978 --> 00:27:07.698]  Do you understand that?
[00:27:08.666 --> 00:27:10.947]  Do you understand we know you're a pack of criminals?
[00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:12.067]  Do you understand that?
[00:27:12.527 --> 00:27:14.088]  We know you're getting rid of our borders.
[00:27:14.168 --> 00:27:16.068]  We know you're bringing in the North American Union.
[00:27:16.388 --> 00:27:18.069]  We know you're destroying our sovereignty.
[00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:24.811]  We know that state and federal government is completely controlled by foreign interests and is sucking all of our money out into international scams.
[00:27:25.151 --> 00:27:27.231]  We know the dollar's been devalued by half.
[00:27:27.691 --> 00:27:29.072]  We know the war is a fraud.
[00:27:29.312 --> 00:27:31.333]  We know you're New World Order trash!
[00:27:32.673 --> 00:27:35.154]  And all your tricks aren't going to turn that around again.
[00:27:35.194 --> 00:27:36.174]  Do you understand that?
[00:27:39.227 --> 00:27:44.075]  We are going to defend this republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:27:44.255 --> 00:27:44.816]  Period.
[00:27:46.239 --> 00:27:48.182]  We are never going to stop.
[00:27:49.019 --> 00:27:56.042]  And we have exposed your vaccine, and we're going to expose every other major operation you're running.
[00:27:56.382 --> 00:27:57.622]  Here it is from the JBS.
[00:27:57.803 --> 00:28:01.424]  Oregon Senate introduces anti-NAU resolution.
[00:28:01.444 --> 00:28:03.285]  This is up on PrismPlanet.com.
[00:28:03.945 --> 00:28:07.166]  Opposition to the North American Union continues to grow in state legislatures.
[00:28:07.606 --> 00:28:17.150]  Oregon is the newest state to introduce legislation that would urge the United States Congress to withdraw from the Security and Prosperity Partnership, SPP, and the further development of the North American Union.
[00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.731]  The resolution, Senate Joint
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:29.445]  Memorial 5 was introduced by Senator Gary George and is co-sponsored by two other state senators and four representatives in part the resolution reads.
[00:28:29.765 --> 00:28:30.966]  Then they walk through it.
[00:28:31.546 --> 00:28:34.567]  And they're telling the House of Representatives federally to override this.
[00:28:35.048 --> 00:28:36.988]  The House was not involved.
[00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:38.409]  The Senate was not involved.
[00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.012]  Unelected bureaucrats are setting the policies and the regulatory
[00:28:44.884 --> 00:28:50.428]  Edicts, the mandates to merge Canada, the U.S.
[00:28:50.468 --> 00:28:51.708]  and Mexico, period.
[00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:53.209]  They tried to deny it.
[00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:57.432]  We got the SPP.gov documents in the four-year releases.
[00:28:57.472 --> 00:28:58.773]  And this is the stuff they would release.
[00:28:58.793 --> 00:29:00.013]  They only released about half of it.
[00:29:00.414 --> 00:29:02.955]  And they opened the meeting with, we've got to keep this secret.
[00:29:03.275 --> 00:29:05.077]  How we're setting up a North American Union.
[00:29:05.297 --> 00:29:08.679]  We've got to use the environmental front groups as a way to push a regional tax.
[00:29:09.259 --> 00:29:13.124]  We've got to use our friends in the media and corporations and all these big CEOs were there.
[00:29:13.445 --> 00:29:14.106]  Hundreds of them.
[00:29:14.146 --> 00:29:16.048]  Members of the media sworn to secrecy.
[00:29:18.371 --> 00:29:18.812]  Red-handed!
[00:29:18.832 --> 00:29:19.933]  Red-handed!
[00:29:23.596 --> 00:29:24.777]  What do the Republicans do?
[00:29:24.857 --> 00:29:27.979]  They play a little trick here to try to spin this.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:37.967]  We'll break it down briefly on the other side, get into the British announcing a total pull-out of Iraq, and much more good news, and then straight to your calls.
[00:29:38.527 --> 00:29:39.468]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:29:39.648 --> 00:29:43.771]  This is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:44.071 --> 00:29:46.653]  More news and information on the other side.
[00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:48.014]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:29:51.602 --> 00:29:52.522]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.002 --> 00:29:54.603]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.623 --> 00:29:58.304]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.644 --> 00:30:05.245]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:30:05.485 --> 00:30:06.345]  Look no further!

[00:30:35.828 --> 00:30:36.168]  I don't know.
[00:30:55.031 --> 00:31:06.040]  Times are tough right now, but there are a lot of different ways to get ourselves out of this mess.

[00:32:01.408 --> 00:32:05.370]  I found this company online and they had this really unique variety of salt wellness products.
[00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:09.172]  I read some of the articles and ended up ordering this beautiful salt lamp.
[00:32:09.432 --> 00:32:13.493]  According to the company, they said that the salt crystal lamps gently purify indoor air.
[00:32:13.794 --> 00:32:14.734]  I was so amazed.
[00:32:14.974 --> 00:32:17.815]  I put it in the baby's room and it made a perfect nightlight.
[00:32:17.996 --> 00:32:19.876]  Both my husband and I could tell the difference.
[00:32:20.257 --> 00:32:25.459]  Soleilwellness.com is a unique company that offers salt wellness products from around the world.
[00:32:25.939 --> 00:32:31.844]  So, I went back to the site and ordered their Soleil Simple Natural Cleaning Products, also made with Himalayan Salt.
[00:32:32.124 --> 00:32:33.846]  I figured it would clean really well.
[00:32:34.106 --> 00:32:37.269]  The natural cleaning products worked wonderfully and there was no scent.
[00:32:37.469 --> 00:32:41.372]  This company has so many products my whole family can enjoy and feel better with.
[00:32:41.653 --> 00:32:43.094]  Plus, the service was great.

[00:32:52.418 --> 00:32:52.458]  312-224-2710.
[00:33:11.381 --> 00:33:15.884]  In 1814 we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[00:33:16.185 --> 00:33:21.188]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town in New Orleans.
[00:33:21.608 --> 00:33:24.090]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.772]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:33:27.012 --> 00:33:32.016]  We fired once more and they began to run it on down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:33:34.941 --> 00:33:40.363]  We looked down a river and we see the British come and there must have been a hundred of them beating on the drum.
[00:33:40.603 --> 00:33:43.064]  They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring.
[00:33:43.344 --> 00:33:45.764]  We stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.
[00:33:45.844 --> 00:33:48.545]  We fired our guns and the British kept a coming.
[00:33:48.785 --> 00:33:51.226]  There wasn't as many as there was a while ago.
[00:33:51.486 --> 00:33:54.147]  We fired once more and they began to runnin'.
[00:33:54.247 --> 00:33:56.488]  On down to Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.
[00:34:01.254 --> 00:34:01.774]  We're good to go.
[00:34:26.169 --> 00:34:26.610]  I think so.
[00:34:41.477 --> 00:34:42.237]  Welcome back.
[00:34:42.277 --> 00:34:42.938]  That's right.
[00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:48.961]  No man in the wrong can stand up against a fellow that's in the right and keeps on a coming and that's what we do every day.
[00:35:09.176 --> 00:35:10.337]  That's the bottom line.
[00:35:10.357 --> 00:35:14.741]  A little bit of absolute, pure, grade-A hick music for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:35:15.122 --> 00:35:17.384]  I guess that's what I am deep down inside.
[00:35:18.084 --> 00:35:20.667]  Okay, we're going to go to your calls, but I promise to cover this 9-11 news first.
[00:35:20.787 --> 00:35:30.636]  I'm going to have open phones throughout the second hour, throughout the end of this hour, and then even into the third hour with Dr. Diegel, who's going to be joining us.
[00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:34.677]  But we have the Oregon Resolution saying no.
[00:35:34.837 --> 00:35:38.338]  We have other states talking about introducing similar legislation.
[00:35:38.978 --> 00:35:42.799]  Massive news item in the alternative press forcing the mainstream media to report.
[00:35:43.339 --> 00:35:45.699]  And then along comes Cliff Kincaid.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:56.762]  Now I remember 10, 15 years ago watching videos of Cliff Kincaid fighting the UN and fighting Bill Clinton and why he's a good guy.
[00:35:58.368 --> 00:36:05.998]  And then he comes out after 9-11 and 9-11 Truths is a bunch of liberal kooks and basically George Bush is good and the Republicans are going to save us.
[00:36:06.498 --> 00:36:09.102]  And he's written this article for Accuracy in Media.
[00:36:10.083 --> 00:36:10.423]  Yeah.
[00:36:11.525 --> 00:36:12.806]  And this is how they spin it.
[00:36:12.826 --> 00:36:13.287]  Listen to this.
[00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:15.451]  North American Union!
[00:36:15.751 --> 00:36:17.513]  Conspiracy exposed!
[00:36:18.273 --> 00:36:21.315]  Oh, thank goodness you've discovered it for us!
[00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:35.105]  A top Democratic Party foreign policy specialist said on Friday that a very small group of conservatives is unfairly accusing him of being at the center of a vast conspiracy to implement the idea of a North American Union by stealth.
[00:36:35.406 --> 00:36:36.847]  He called the charges absurd!
[00:36:38.169 --> 00:36:50.334]  Robert Pasture, a former official of the Carter Administration and director of the North American Studies at American University, made the remarks in an all-day February 16th conference devoted to the development of the North American legal system.
[00:36:51.174 --> 00:36:58.937]  The holding of a conference was itself evidence that the comprehensive process is underway to merge economies and perhaps the social and political systems of the three nations.
[00:36:59.517 --> 00:37:00.758]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:37:02.698 --> 00:37:05.860]  And it goes on to say that Pasture wants a North American community.
[00:37:07.975 --> 00:37:12.556]  We learn in the article it's a Democratic conspiracy, it's the Liberals.
[00:37:14.416 --> 00:37:16.657]  No, Mr. Kincaid.
[00:37:17.577 --> 00:37:24.358]  The Council on Foreign Relations is actually made up of more Republicans than it is Democrats, but it's non-partisan.
[00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:34.220]  The heads of banking, the heads of industry, the heads of media, the heads of academia, the heads of government, state, federal, and key local leaders.
[00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:35.421]  Over 4,000 members now.
[00:37:37.504 --> 00:37:40.306]  And they put out the bi-monthly publication Foreign Affairs.
[00:37:40.386 --> 00:37:45.170]  Their leadership is also the leadership of Bilderberg, Trilateral, and other key groups.
[00:37:45.210 --> 00:37:52.736]  But it's the major roundtable management arm of the global government system in North America.
[00:37:53.917 --> 00:37:55.598]  And they have other interlocking councils.
[00:37:56.258 --> 00:37:57.339]  It's a corporate structure.
[00:37:57.399 --> 00:37:59.701]  It's a mafia kingpin structure.
[00:38:01.042 --> 00:38:04.425]  It's a business piracy structure.
[00:38:05.105 --> 00:38:06.046]  It's a commission.
[00:38:07.001 --> 00:38:08.002]  And this is what they do.
[00:38:09.463 --> 00:38:17.347]  And so, when the Democrats were in power, oh, the New World Order's all a Democratic thing, and then Republicans get in power, and still, it's a Democrat thing.
[00:38:18.388 --> 00:38:23.131]  When you do that, you fool conservatives into thinking the Republican Party is going to save them.
[00:38:23.391 --> 00:38:31.336]  You keep the false left-right, Matrix-like, false reality going, and you put more life into it.
[00:38:32.027 --> 00:38:42.588]  George Bush took Robert Pasture's entire Towards a North American Community plan written by a Council on Foreign Relations committee.
[00:38:44.242 --> 00:39:02.346]  That was then implemented word for word into the Security and Prosperity Partnership Agreement of March of 2005 now being implemented at the North American Union Summit they had last September in Canada and again we have the four year documents on that.
[00:39:02.666 --> 00:39:08.207]  It is North American Union and the number one first issue was how to keep integration
[00:39:08.948 --> 00:39:12.931]  And that's a quote, secret from the public.
[00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:14.512]  The heads of the Mexican, U.S.
[00:39:14.772 --> 00:39:23.158]  and Canadian government meeting with over 200 CEOs and CFOs and others and key media on how to keep the public in the dark.
[00:39:23.678 --> 00:39:37.987]  Now if that doesn't make you mad, if that isn't treason, if that isn't larceny, if that isn't racketeering, if that isn't collusion, if that isn't extortion, if that isn't fraud, if that isn't a conspiracy, I don't know what is.
[00:39:40.749 --> 00:39:43.810]  Agenda number two was a North American Union tax.
[00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:45.031]  What are they going to use?
[00:39:45.211 --> 00:39:47.512]  The toll roads and a carbon tax.
[00:39:47.572 --> 00:39:49.632]  Going after transportation and mobility.
[00:39:49.933 --> 00:39:51.833]  Something our society is totally built on.
[00:39:53.194 --> 00:39:53.914]  You know, that's it.
[00:39:54.094 --> 00:39:55.535]  I've told my producer this before.
[00:39:55.735 --> 00:39:58.576]  I want Cliff Kincaid on the show.
[00:39:59.136 --> 00:40:01.817]  I want Cliff Kincaid on the show.
[00:40:02.398 --> 00:40:07.920]  I want him to come on here for an hour and spew his baloney.
[00:40:09.156 --> 00:40:18.346]  To me, there's frankly nothing worse than somebody that acts like they're anti-New World Order, but over and over again does this and criticizes me and others, and I'm frankly sick of it.
[00:40:18.787 --> 00:40:20.669]  I never changed, Mr. Kincaid.
[00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.590]  You did.
[00:40:22.151 --> 00:40:24.974]  I'm still a Constitutionalist like I was 12 years ago.
[00:40:25.735 --> 00:40:28.418]  You, I don't know what you call yourself, but
[00:40:29.088 --> 00:40:39.434]  You know, these neocon followers have got to report on the North American Union, so they spin it and say it's a Democratic Party conspiracy.
[00:40:39.674 --> 00:40:41.595]  Oh, the Democratic Party is firmly behind it.
[00:40:41.875 --> 00:40:42.836]  Totally traitorous.
[00:40:43.056 --> 00:40:44.237]  Absolute scum.
[00:40:44.677 --> 00:40:46.758]  Enemies of the American people and the world.
[00:40:47.118 --> 00:40:48.719]  Bought and paid for by the same interest.
[00:40:49.319 --> 00:40:53.742]  And when you play into this thing that there's some choice
[00:40:54.677 --> 00:41:01.743]  You just continue the illusion and the fraud, and maybe you're just an idiot, but you come off like a smart fellow.
[00:41:04.185 --> 00:41:06.447]  I've had enough, and I want him on.
[00:41:07.308 --> 00:41:11.772]  So, I just remembered I've been asking for him for months, and I want him on the show.
[00:41:12.633 --> 00:41:20.820]  The other good news, and we'll get into this 9-11 clip, Cheney says British troop withdrawal is a positive sign.
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:21.981]  You talk about spin,
[00:41:23.556 --> 00:41:25.597]  Tell soldiers in Tokyo the U.S.
[00:41:25.617 --> 00:41:27.538]  will not withdraw until the job is done.
[00:41:27.598 --> 00:41:30.419]  So he says, oh yes, this is a good thing.
[00:41:30.479 --> 00:41:31.779]  We'll break that down later.
[00:41:32.419 --> 00:41:46.225]  First off, let's go ahead and play a clip of a lady who has just a ton of courage and who I commend for what she's done.
[00:41:47.986 --> 00:41:49.046]  Christine Ebersold.
[00:41:50.077 --> 00:41:51.457]  I'm trying to find my article here.
[00:41:51.477 --> 00:41:55.419]  I've got a New York Post article concerning this.
[00:41:55.459 --> 00:41:55.839]  Here it is.
[00:41:56.719 --> 00:42:00.800]  New York Post slams Ebersole for becoming 9-11 truther.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.061]  Add Christine Ebersole to the list of kooks.
[00:42:04.641 --> 00:42:06.962]  Yeah, 36% of Americans in a 9-month-old poll.
[00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:11.083]  84% I believe it's a cover-up in a 5-month-old poll.
[00:42:11.423 --> 00:42:11.603]  True.
[00:42:12.364 --> 00:42:17.065]  Add Christine Ebersole to the list of kooks who say 9-11 terror attacks were an inside job.
[00:42:17.825 --> 00:42:19.646]  The Grey Gardens star went on
[00:42:21.056 --> 00:42:28.301]  Writer John Connor's radio show, right here on Genesis I would add, the other night to say that she agrees with him that a corrupt faction of the U.S.
[00:42:28.341 --> 00:42:29.962]  government is to blame.
[00:42:30.842 --> 00:42:48.193]  I think we want to look at our government as sort of like a benevolent father that's going to take care of us and be kind to us and treat us well and I think it's too much for people to conceptualize and I'm sure that's what helped the people in Nazi Germany, Ebersole said.
[00:42:51.028 --> 00:43:06.345]  Now, if you go to Christine Ebersole's website, if you go there, I think it's ChristineEbersole.com, I had that here in front of me, too.
[00:43:06.365 --> 00:43:08.827]  I asked for it again, but I don't have it.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.661]  I want you to go on there and support her.
[00:43:12.701 --> 00:43:20.289]  I haven't said this yet, but we were looking at it, like 90% of the people on her guestbook, her little message board, are supporting her, telling her great job.
[00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:25.915]  She was really excited yesterday, a few days after she went on Connor's show.
[00:43:26.996 --> 00:43:35.204]  She told Connor on the support she was getting, but then she went in for a Broadway show and her publicist and other people
[00:43:36.368 --> 00:43:39.269]  Are you know saying hey, you know, you better quit this.
[00:43:39.309 --> 00:43:49.613]  Hey, this could cause people to protest you You know what she's already jumped off the cliff and she's There's a safety net down there.
[00:43:49.693 --> 00:44:00.576]  The only way she won't have a safety net if she doesn't pull her parachute and Continue to stand her ground what she's doing But she's pretty freaked out right now.
[00:44:00.616 --> 00:44:05.098]  So we should all pray for because she was extremely bold
[00:44:07.205 --> 00:44:09.507]  In her statements that we're going to play.
[00:44:09.527 --> 00:44:11.929]  In fact, let's play the first half of it now.
[00:44:11.949 --> 00:44:13.590]  We'll play the second five minutes.
[00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:14.451]  This is condensed.
[00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:15.752]  John edited this together.
[00:44:16.372 --> 00:44:21.116]  This is from his Sunday night radio show that he does right here on Genesis.
[00:44:22.017 --> 00:44:24.159]  Here is the first half of that.
[00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:32.806]  There's some people that I work with, some people at work, that I think are upset about my
[00:44:35.572 --> 00:44:58.321]  Talking about 9-11 and president with an inside job and you know they're worried about my career and worried about you know what's gonna happen and things like that and I don't think people really want to really take in the reality that our government could do us harm.
[00:44:59.921 --> 00:45:01.362]  And I think that's what they're saying.
[00:45:01.422 --> 00:45:05.984]  It's just really a matter of just taking in that reality.
[00:45:06.244 --> 00:45:18.891]  I think we want to look at our government as sort of like a benevolent father that's going to take care of us and be kind to us and treat us well.
[00:45:19.271 --> 00:45:22.953]  I think it's too much for people to even conceptualize.
[00:45:22.973 --> 00:45:25.775]  And I'm sure that happened to the people in Mr. Jones.
[00:45:27.308 --> 00:45:28.149]  We're going to take a break.
[00:45:28.169 --> 00:45:29.991]  We'll be back in just a minute and get into how you woke up.
[00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:31.572]  This is Resistance Radio, John Carr.
[00:45:31.792 --> 00:45:34.535]  You know, things just weren't adding up.
[00:45:35.415 --> 00:45:50.409]  And I think just, I mean, for me, I know it's really hard to say, John, what's the exact sort of epiphany that I had where I just realized that it was the government that did harm to its own people.
[00:45:51.269 --> 00:45:54.192]  But I think
[00:45:55.103 --> 00:46:01.845]  Maybe what a deciding one was when my dentist sent me a link to Lose Change.
[00:46:03.486 --> 00:46:16.610]  And when I saw that, everything that I feared or everything that I intuitively felt was confirmed by watching Lose Change.
[00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:17.570]  And you suspected?
[00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:18.631]  Yeah.
[00:46:20.564 --> 00:46:31.693]  Christine, if we were friends and you had never approached me about this subject, if I was still an ignorant zombie, how would you go about educating me?
[00:46:31.713 --> 00:46:32.394]  What would you say?
[00:46:32.414 --> 00:46:41.001]  I'd ask about World Trade Center number 7.
[00:46:43.163 --> 00:46:43.723]  Number 1.
[00:46:43.943 --> 00:46:49.268]  I think that's really, to me, the most obvious.
[00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:50.830]  Blunder.
[00:46:52.170 --> 00:47:10.854]  Because Silverstein said publicly that we had talked with the fire department and we felt that World Trade Center 7 was so badly damaged that we decided to take it down or take it out.
[00:47:12.074 --> 00:47:15.895]  Take it out, I guess that's the term that's used for controlled demolition.
[00:47:17.616 --> 00:47:19.476]  Now, you cannot put
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:24.663]  Controlled demolition devices in a building in an afternoon.
[00:47:24.683 --> 00:47:27.266]  That's just not possible.
[00:47:29.007 --> 00:47:33.451]  So, how do you... Of course, they never even mention it.
[00:47:33.771 --> 00:47:37.054]  You know, they talk about the Twin Towers collapsing.
[00:47:37.694 --> 00:47:39.235]  That's never even mentioned.
[00:47:39.255 --> 00:47:41.097]  Apparently it wasn't even brought up in the report.
[00:47:42.338 --> 00:47:43.479]  The 9-11 Commission report.
[00:47:43.499 --> 00:47:45.280]  So, to me, that's... Oh, no.
[00:47:47.777 --> 00:47:48.798]  How do you explain that?
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:59.292]  If somebody says publicly, the owner of the building says publicly, that the fire department, we talked about it and they decided to take it out.
[00:48:01.555 --> 00:48:03.197]  What do you think about Cheney's stand down order?
[00:48:07.366 --> 00:48:09.426]  They always morph their way out of that one.
[00:48:09.566 --> 00:48:12.467]  The list is unbelievable.
[00:48:12.547 --> 00:48:14.327]  It's unbelievably long.
[00:48:14.447 --> 00:48:20.168]  What do you think about Operation Northwoods and all the warnings from all the foreign different countries?
[00:48:20.188 --> 00:48:21.629]  Well, you see, that's another thing.
[00:48:21.729 --> 00:48:31.110]  They think that Operation Northwoods, well, just because they wrote it and because Lemaitre was fired by Kennedy doesn't mean that they would do it.
[00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.370]  I mean, it's just nuts.
[00:48:33.231 --> 00:48:35.471]  People can't face reality.
[00:48:36.388 --> 00:48:37.469]  It's too difficult.
[00:48:38.309 --> 00:48:39.230]  It's just too much.
[00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:45.173]  Now they want to do the DNA sampling of immigrants.
[00:48:45.233 --> 00:48:46.774]  I mean, come on, what's next?
[00:48:47.615 --> 00:48:50.336]  We'll all get implanted with those chips.
[00:48:52.298 --> 00:48:54.519]  And it's just a way of controlling people.
[00:48:54.539 --> 00:48:59.242]  I think of Bush's affiliation with the Skull and Bones and the Bohemian Grove.
[00:49:00.314 --> 00:49:14.960]  Yeah, that's another thing that's just really so disturbing, is that, you know, of course, people want to make this a left-right issue, and, you know, a Christian-Muslim issue, and he makes a mockery of Christianity.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:19.762]  It just is, it's really disgraceful.
[00:49:20.422 --> 00:49:23.484]  And, you know, again, everybody gets, everybody's fooled.
[00:49:23.504 --> 00:49:26.785]  They call themselves Christians who, they're worshiping a false god!
[00:49:27.757 --> 00:49:30.739]  And that's exactly what George Bush is doing!
[00:49:31.659 --> 00:49:38.002]  You know, the god of money, the god of power, the god of, you know, science to give us a nuclear bomb.
[00:49:38.643 --> 00:49:42.945]  I mean, it's, um, it's quite disgraceful.
[00:49:42.985 --> 00:49:47.327]  But the whole thing about, you know, Bohemian Grove, I had never heard of that until I'd gone to your website.
[00:49:48.267 --> 00:49:53.210]  And when I saw that, you know, he certainly, for a man who calls himself, you know,
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.180]  Saved by Jesus and all that stuff.
[00:49:56.341 --> 00:50:04.662]  You know, burning mock human effigies, mock human sacrifices is not worshipping God!
[00:50:04.682 --> 00:50:08.463]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:50:08.483 --> 00:50:10.583]  He's completely hijacked the Republican Party.
[00:50:10.603 --> 00:50:14.944]  This is not a Republican-Democratic issue and that's why it doesn't matter.
[00:50:15.024 --> 00:50:23.106]  You know, people I'm seeing are known as, what I say, a progressive thinker, you know,
[00:50:24.769 --> 00:50:26.311]  Liberal, as it were.
[00:50:27.051 --> 00:50:29.453]  But I'm always screaming, don't call me a Democrat!
[00:50:29.753 --> 00:50:30.674]  I'm not a Democrat!
[00:50:31.354 --> 00:50:32.575]  You know, there's no Democrats.
[00:50:32.836 --> 00:50:34.757]  There is no two-party system.
[00:50:35.197 --> 00:50:36.218]  Clinton took care of that.
[00:50:37.339 --> 00:50:48.668]  Now, by the way, we have discovered that Ella Lemonsir was rehired in 1974 and came into the Ford administration when Cheney came in.
[00:50:49.668 --> 00:50:51.089]  And he's part of that whole nest.
[00:50:51.169 --> 00:50:57.394]  So now, we're only talking about 25, 30 years ago with Northwoods.
[00:50:57.574 --> 00:50:58.675]  That's now been confirmed.
[00:50:58.695 --> 00:51:06.701]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.041 --> 00:51:08.962]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:09.342 --> 00:51:16.968]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.668 --> 00:51:24.730]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:36.572]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.853 --> 00:51:40.333]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:40.813 --> 00:51:42.754]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.074 --> 00:51:46.935]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:02.846]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:52:03.166 --> 00:52:05.948]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?

[00:54:04.207 --> 00:54:15.887]  Christine Ebersole, the first prominent Hollywood woman to go public in a very articulate and riveting fashion being savaged by the neocon New York Post and
[00:54:17.131 --> 00:54:25.735]  She's getting nothing but positive feedback, but she's also being basically throttled by insiders telling her that she needs to back off and shut up.
[00:54:26.155 --> 00:54:27.876]  We need to pray for and support her.
[00:54:28.456 --> 00:54:33.798]  Now again, it's really clear if you listen to the full hour, but this is what he edited together on the web, so it's an mp3 we grabbed.
[00:54:33.818 --> 00:54:35.739]  It's a little bit fuzzy, but it's pretty good audio.
[00:54:35.779 --> 00:54:36.419]  Here's the rest of it.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.741]  There is no two-party system.
[00:54:39.221 --> 00:54:40.161]  Clinton took care of that.
[00:54:40.181 --> 00:54:41.962]  He was the best Republican president we ever had.
[00:54:43.092 --> 00:54:45.854]  I mean, you know, they've absolutely brought everything to the center.
[00:54:46.594 --> 00:54:50.917]  And, you know, now there's infiltrating Republicans and the Democrats in each other's party.
[00:54:51.577 --> 00:54:52.658]  No one has a spine.
[00:54:53.098 --> 00:54:56.681]  No one can stand up, I mean, to this regime.
[00:54:57.901 --> 00:55:03.725]  It's absolutely, it's so influenced by, you know, the pharmaceuticals.
[00:55:03.865 --> 00:55:11.370]  I mean, just of all the lobbies that go into, you know, the making of the New World Order, nobody has a leg to stand on.
[00:55:12.126 --> 00:55:14.907]  Especially if they're interested in getting re-elected.
[00:55:17.447 --> 00:55:19.088]  They go along to get along.
[00:55:19.588 --> 00:55:22.729]  Yeah.
[00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:28.070]  We shared some of our personal religious beliefs over the phone when we spoke privately.
[00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:30.451]  Do you mind to share those with the audience?
[00:55:30.811 --> 00:55:31.551]  No, not at all.
[00:55:34.692 --> 00:55:38.913]  I grew up, I was raised a Unitarian, which is
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:46.663]  Which basically teaches that all roads lead to Rome.
[00:55:46.823 --> 00:55:56.387]  It emphasizes the brotherhood of man and that concentrically it's all an expression of our Creator.
[00:55:58.128 --> 00:56:07.311]  But I think probably because my name is Christine, which means most devout Christian or follower of Christ,
[00:56:10.856 --> 00:56:38.809]  My spiritual beliefs and my spiritual convictions from pretty early on was aware that for me Christ is the greatest example of what we should aspire to
[00:56:40.029 --> 00:56:41.690]  How to live our lives on this earth.
[00:56:43.230 --> 00:57:06.641]  And that's why, you know, for George Bush and all of these people that call themselves Christians and they absolutely do not adhere to his basic principle and precept was that, you know, you love your God with all your heart and soul and mind and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:57:07.581 --> 00:57:09.322]  And love your enemies.
[00:57:09.932 --> 00:57:10.392]  How about that?
[00:57:10.412 --> 00:57:12.313]  That was absolutely radical.
[00:57:12.713 --> 00:57:13.273]  Radical!
[00:57:13.913 --> 00:57:17.374]  And to me, Jesus is alive today.
[00:57:17.394 --> 00:57:22.096]  To me, that Christ is living in each of us.
[00:57:23.036 --> 00:57:30.778]  In each of us that practice the principles of life and how he lived his life.
[00:57:30.798 --> 00:57:32.279]  But he is an enemy combatant.
[00:57:33.139 --> 00:57:34.700]  Jesus Christ is an enemy combatant.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:36.020]  Right on.
[00:57:37.897 --> 00:57:38.817]  Right on.
[00:57:38.997 --> 00:57:41.018]  You're speaking some powerful truth there, Christina.
[00:57:41.078 --> 00:57:42.719]  I just want to thank you again for joining us.
[00:57:42.759 --> 00:57:43.759]  Thanks for having the courage.
[00:57:44.339 --> 00:57:47.700]  Thanks for plugging theresistancemanifesto.com on national television.
[00:57:48.781 --> 00:57:50.601]  We've got about 30 seconds to go here.
[00:57:50.621 --> 00:57:52.082]  Is there anything else you want to share with everybody?
[00:57:52.582 --> 00:58:00.185]  Well, I just really applaud the work that you're doing, and I just appreciate you so much, and power to the resistance.
[00:58:01.045 --> 00:58:01.965]  Awesome.
[00:58:02.546 --> 00:58:03.386]  God bless, Christine.
[00:58:03.406 --> 00:58:04.286]  Christina Eppersole.
[00:58:04.686 --> 00:58:06.207]  Look her up on christineeppersole.com.
[00:58:07.122 --> 00:58:10.623]  My mom's a big fan of yours, so I just want to thank you for joining us.
[00:58:12.043 --> 00:58:13.064]  We'll keep in touch, Christine.
[00:58:13.084 --> 00:58:13.864]  This is John Connor.
[00:58:13.884 --> 00:58:15.744]  You've been listening to... Alright, folks.
[00:58:16.285 --> 00:58:17.945]  That's John Connor's Sunday night program.
[00:58:17.965 --> 00:58:19.766]  He's now doing a Monday through Friday show.
[00:58:19.806 --> 00:58:26.607]  It's a roundtable program, but he's the master host there on Friday nights now for two hours here on GCN as well.
[00:58:26.667 --> 00:58:28.788]  So Friday and Sunday nights, you can always catch John.
[00:58:29.168 --> 00:58:32.129]  He pops in Monday through Friday on the rest of that show with Webster Tarpley.
[00:58:33.004 --> 00:58:36.126]  And of course, Gary Franchi and Dan Abramson.
[00:58:36.486 --> 00:58:38.027]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:40.008 --> 00:58:45.992]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.032 --> 00:58:50.614]  Hello!
[00:58:56.438 --> 00:58:57.098]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.738 --> 00:58:58.839]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.499 --> 00:59:00.620]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:02.041]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.834 --> 00:59:04.736]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.756 --> 00:59:08.339]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.579 --> 00:59:12.683]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.765 --> 00:59:18.247]  Now into the second hour.
[00:59:18.288 --> 00:59:24.473]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we're going to have a quick update on the move in the state of New Mexico to impeach George W. Puppet Bush.
[00:59:25.859 --> 00:59:29.721]  We're about to go to your phone calls in this hour.
[00:59:29.741 --> 00:59:30.981]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:31.461 --> 00:59:32.242]  More good news.
[00:59:32.282 --> 00:59:34.142]  The Brits announcing they're going to pull their troops out.
[00:59:34.182 --> 00:59:38.724]  They're suspending the big lobbying effort for the live cancer virus vaccine.
[00:59:38.764 --> 00:59:42.246]  Merck's putting out a bunch of other good news as well.
[00:59:42.266 --> 00:59:44.127]  We'll be going over in more detail right now.
[00:59:44.227 --> 00:59:45.647]  Roger in Key West, Florida.
[00:59:45.687 --> 00:59:46.427]  Thank you for holding.
[00:59:49.069 --> 00:59:49.249]  Hello?
[00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:50.069]  Yes, sir.
[00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.429]  Go ahead.
[00:59:51.009 --> 00:59:51.229]  Hi.
[00:59:51.830 --> 00:59:52.670]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:53.250]  Good.
[00:59:53.650 --> 00:59:54.751]  Called a couple times before.
[00:59:55.806 --> 00:59:58.667]  I usually agree with everything you say.
[00:59:59.067 --> 01:00:02.088]  I just have a little bit of a bone to pick with you.
[01:00:02.108 --> 01:00:12.311]  You know, you keep on talking of the New World Order and the damage that they're causing and, you know, we need to wake up.
[01:00:12.991 --> 01:00:13.831]  And I agree with you.
[01:00:14.191 --> 01:00:17.652]  I wholeheartedly believe that... Do me a favor, talk right into your telephone.
[01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:19.133]  I'm sorry, can you hear me now?
[01:00:19.173 --> 01:00:19.653]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:00:20.273 --> 01:00:23.034]  Alright, I just believe that, you know,
[01:00:23.806 --> 01:00:32.191]  This new world order does exist, but I think it's time that you and other media people start to expose who they are.
[01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:33.411]  Who are these people?
[01:00:33.451 --> 01:00:35.472]  Who are the individuals who are behind it?
[01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:36.513]  Who are controlling it?
[01:00:37.373 --> 01:00:38.094]  Who's at the wheel?
[01:00:39.014 --> 01:00:43.417]  Well, I'm making a film right now about that, but we list who the top families are.
[01:00:43.457 --> 01:00:46.999]  We list who top the heads of CFR, Trilateral Commission are.
[01:00:47.019 --> 01:00:49.260]  I mean, it's the old classic names.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.281]  It's the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:01:00.888]  I mean, it's the Dutch royalty, the British royalty, there's some rich Saudis, there's some rich Japanese, but mainly it's rich families out of Europe.
[01:01:00.948 --> 01:01:02.890]  It's King Juan Carlos of Spain.
[01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:10.337]  I mean, these guys love to put out propaganda about how they don't have any power, but if you actually research it, they are the richest people in the world.
[01:01:11.197 --> 01:01:13.399]  Yeah, but how do we go about contacting them?
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:17.924]  I mean, I'm not talking paparazzi stalking outside their gates or their doors or whatever,
[01:01:18.604 --> 01:01:24.288]  You know, flooding their phones, email... Well, I mean, I've gone to Bilderberg Group meeting and confronted them.
[01:01:24.308 --> 01:01:26.269]  I've been to CFR meetings and confronted them.
[01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:29.151]  I've had a lot of guests on who go and confront them.
[01:01:29.191 --> 01:01:29.832]  We do that.
[01:01:29.892 --> 01:01:31.033]  I don't know what you're criticizing.
[01:01:31.113 --> 01:01:32.113]  I can't do it all, man.
[01:01:32.534 --> 01:01:35.456]  People think I'm like magic and know everything and can do everything.
[01:01:35.556 --> 01:01:35.956]  I can't.
[01:01:36.897 --> 01:01:37.477]  And I know that.
[01:01:37.637 --> 01:01:41.780]  I would just... maybe if you provided that information more to the public.
[01:01:43.305 --> 01:01:48.812]  Well, you know, there's different views on exactly who is the most powerful in the ruling elite, but you can definitely find out who's in the upper crust.
[01:01:49.313 --> 01:01:55.040]  And just Google, you know, who rules the New World Order, who are the masters of the New World Order, and then go do your own research.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:55.981]  But we know, look,
[01:01:58.074 --> 01:02:04.155]  Of 100 of the biggest economies, 46, it was 44, now it's 46 of them are corporations.
[01:02:04.615 --> 01:02:06.316]  And you have the private shareholders of those.
[01:02:06.336 --> 01:02:09.016]  You have the private shareholders of the private central banks.
[01:02:09.296 --> 01:02:10.677]  That's who owns and runs things.
[01:02:10.957 --> 01:02:12.677]  And they've got a new world order agenda.
[01:02:13.197 --> 01:02:19.799]  Sometimes I think there's too much focus on who they are, we know who they are, instead of fighting their institutions and their programs.
[01:02:20.059 --> 01:02:23.999]  Like fighting this forced inoculation, fighting the North American Union.
[01:02:24.119 --> 01:02:26.800]  I'm fighting their agenda as well as exposing them.
[01:02:27.466 --> 01:02:29.328]  It seems like they use those as chess pieces, though.
[01:02:29.348 --> 01:02:30.869]  They sit back and watch how they're moved.
[01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:34.232]  And then if it's fought at one level, they're like six moves ahead.
[01:02:34.512 --> 01:02:35.473]  No, they're not.
[01:02:35.493 --> 01:02:36.914]  Sir, we're starting to beat them.
[01:02:38.015 --> 01:02:42.919]  And we just need to get boots on the ground, you know, fight for the Second Amendment, fight for controlling our borders.
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:48.084]  Pick something they're pushing and go fight that agenda, and then don't worry about winning.
[01:02:48.124 --> 01:02:49.425]  You'll win if you just fight.
[01:02:49.945 --> 01:02:54.149]  Well, here's an example that I thought that we had a good chance on winning on.
[01:02:54.933 --> 01:02:59.656]  And I thought it would have really taken him down hard, like some of the higher... Okay, go ahead and say it.
[01:02:59.696 --> 01:03:00.496]  What is it?
[01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:01.777]  The conspiracy to silence.
[01:03:03.538 --> 01:03:04.518]  With Larry King.
[01:03:05.019 --> 01:03:16.405]  I mean, the things that went on in Boys Town, and the higher levels of government in the White House, and the congressional push to oust that show off Discovery Channel back in 94.
[01:03:17.842 --> 01:03:19.422]  Yeah, and we've posted links to that.
[01:03:19.482 --> 01:03:21.123]  We've had guests on many times.
[01:03:21.183 --> 01:03:23.063]  We've covered what they're into, what they do.
[01:03:23.523 --> 01:03:24.644]  It has been coming out.
[01:03:25.684 --> 01:03:31.505]  But, you know, something that horrible, you're probably not going to get the people, general public, to ever accept that that's fully going on.
[01:03:31.525 --> 01:03:32.906]  And look, just have a good attitude.
[01:03:32.986 --> 01:03:33.846]  I appreciate your call.
[01:03:34.506 --> 01:03:36.987]  I mean, I understand you want to see it all beat overnight.
[01:03:37.027 --> 01:03:40.848]  You want to see, you know, one big champion defeat the New World Order.
[01:03:41.508 --> 01:03:44.209]  But they didn't build their system overnight.
[01:03:44.249 --> 01:03:45.469]  We're not going to defeat it overnight.
[01:03:46.104 --> 01:03:49.245]  Just, uh, there's too much talk about even how to beat it.
[01:03:49.365 --> 01:03:50.425]  Just to start fighting them!
[01:03:51.966 --> 01:03:58.247]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:58.587 --> 01:04:00.528]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:00.888 --> 01:04:08.490]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:09.238 --> 01:04:16.301]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:16.681 --> 01:04:28.106]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.426 --> 01:04:31.888]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:32.388 --> 01:04:34.329]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:38.491]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:51.963 --> 01:04:57.186]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:04:57.326 --> 01:05:05.431]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:05:05.671 --> 01:05:12.735]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:05:13.676 --> 01:05:20.160]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:25.444]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:05:25.564 --> 01:05:34.450]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:37.993]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:05:52.941 --> 01:05:55.502]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here with an important question.
[01:05:55.662 --> 01:05:57.823]  When was the last time you used pure soap?
[01:05:58.104 --> 01:06:08.209]  I mean the hard to find kind that's all natural and not full of corrosive toxins and chemicals and detergents that just dry out your skin and have been connected to very serious health problems?
[01:06:08.509 --> 01:06:10.830]  Let me tell you something about the Calbin Pure Soap Company.

[01:06:51.752 --> 01:06:57.756]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:59.157 --> 01:07:04.581]  Alright, Woody, George, Danny, Paula, Ryan, we're gonna get to all of you.
[01:07:06.326 --> 01:07:09.049]  There is a move at the state levels to impeach George Bush.
[01:07:09.069 --> 01:07:11.992]  We'll have a guest on for about 10-15 minutes at the bottom of the hour.
[01:07:12.012 --> 01:07:14.735]  Then we'll continue with open phones.
[01:07:15.776 --> 01:07:17.978]  There is just so much good news that's happening.
[01:07:17.998 --> 01:07:27.328]  I also want to get in this hour to the British troop pullout, which Dick Cheney then tried to spin and say, look, it means we're doing good.
[01:07:29.168 --> 01:07:30.969]  So we'll go over all of that.
[01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:35.332]  But before we go back to your calls, once a month I have him up and I always enjoy talking to him.
[01:07:35.372 --> 01:07:37.234]  I know our listeners love hearing from him.
[01:07:37.994 --> 01:07:38.615]  He's Marty.
[01:07:39.075 --> 01:07:43.058]  He is the owner of Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:07:43.818 --> 01:07:44.519]  Marty Schachter.
[01:07:44.659 --> 01:07:47.201]  And they started it back, what, in 1947?
[01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:50.643]  So this is their 60th year.
[01:07:50.663 --> 01:07:53.465]  It is organic soap.
[01:07:54.366 --> 01:07:55.527]  No animal fats.
[01:07:56.347 --> 01:07:57.428]  It's nothing but organic.
[01:07:58.344 --> 01:08:05.829]  Products, organic, naturally grown products, coconut oil, and extracts of plants.
[01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:09.992]  And I've told the story, and I always tell it when he comes on, but I'll just tell it briefly.
[01:08:10.593 --> 01:08:14.015]  He was sponsoring on Genesis about, I guess, four or five years ago.
[01:08:14.976 --> 01:08:23.662]  First time he'd ever advertised, he started selling directly to consumers instead of the hospitals and to hotels, finer hospitals and hotels.
[01:08:24.278 --> 01:08:27.941]  Because they were saving 85% off and they knew what real soap was.
[01:08:29.362 --> 01:08:35.066]  And I've actually seen in one nice hotel, I believe it was in New York or DC one time, I saw Calvin Pierce soap.
[01:08:35.086 --> 01:08:40.270]  Because you can never forget the cherry slash almond oil smell just of the bar soap.
[01:08:40.470 --> 01:08:48.056]  And they've got shampoo, they've got stuff to clean your clothes, your dishes, and they sell direct to you.
[01:08:48.076 --> 01:08:50.178]  See it was advertising on the network and
[01:08:51.698 --> 01:08:55.281]  One of the folks that worked at the network said, hey, this fellow wants to send you some free samples.
[01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:56.041]  So I said, okay.
[01:08:56.061 --> 01:08:57.362]  Well, a year's supply came.
[01:08:58.063 --> 01:09:00.504]  And about a year and a half later, my wife says, where'd you get that soap?
[01:09:00.584 --> 01:09:01.425]  I want some more.
[01:09:01.465 --> 01:09:02.326]  It really works good.
[01:09:02.386 --> 01:09:04.888]  And I go, yeah, it's great bar soap, isn't it?
[01:09:04.928 --> 01:09:05.888]  Great for washing the clothes.
[01:09:06.489 --> 01:09:09.331]  So we called Marty and we're trying to buy some.
[01:09:09.351 --> 01:09:10.832]  Here comes another free year's supply.
[01:09:11.784 --> 01:09:16.065]  And I was running out of that now, and I thought, you know, why not just call him up and get him as a sponsor of this show?
[01:09:16.105 --> 01:09:16.906]  I believe in the product.
[01:09:16.946 --> 01:09:17.726]  It's made in America.
[01:09:17.986 --> 01:09:18.726]  It's family owned.
[01:09:18.766 --> 01:09:20.047]  He supports Truth Radio.
[01:09:20.307 --> 01:09:24.988]  He supports Patriot Radio, Constitutional Radio, Resistance Radio, whatever you want to call it.
[01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:26.349]  Freedom Radio.
[01:09:27.269 --> 01:09:28.509]  You can't really put a handle on it.
[01:09:29.109 --> 01:09:29.810]  Why not have him?
[01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:30.710]  I mean, I believe in it.
[01:09:32.260 --> 01:09:34.221]  And I endorse very few products.
[01:09:34.241 --> 01:09:35.921]  You know, it's not magical.
[01:09:35.981 --> 01:09:37.122]  It won't make your hair grow back.
[01:09:37.162 --> 01:09:38.082]  It won't make you live forever.
[01:09:38.102 --> 01:09:52.867]  It's just high quality, made in America, out in Oakland, California, soap products, without all the toxic chemicals and things that are in the detergents and things that the chemical companies predominantly own, Procter & Gamble and other big, there's only two or three big soap companies.
[01:09:53.228 --> 01:09:54.048]  It's not really soap.
[01:09:54.148 --> 01:09:55.328]  It eats holes in your clothes.
[01:09:55.628 --> 01:09:56.149]  It's toxic.
[01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:57.129]  It causes rashes.
[01:09:57.964 --> 01:10:04.889]  I mean, the hundreds of ingredients, it's petrochemical, why are you doing it and paying 85% more on average?
[01:10:05.309 --> 01:10:13.055]  Marty, they need to give you a call, they need to go to your website, they need to get the sampler pack or free catalog, or they need to order a year's supply, don't they?
[01:10:13.636 --> 01:10:20.861]  Yes, that's the way to deprogram them from the corporations like Procter, Lever and Colgate
[01:10:21.348 --> 01:10:27.810]  that have literally hypnotized and brainwashed a consumer for over 60 years.
[01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:29.811]  And we have to deprogram it.
[01:10:29.931 --> 01:10:36.713]  It's not easy, but we've got pure soaps that work twice as good as anything they've ever bought before.
[01:10:38.314 --> 01:10:41.435]  And they could just get a free catalog right away.
[01:10:41.455 --> 01:10:43.816]  All they got to do is call me toll free 1-800
[01:10:45.623 --> 01:10:45.843]  3-4-0-7-0-9-1.
[01:10:45.923 --> 01:10:46.604]  That's 800-3-4-0-7-0-9-1.
[01:10:46.724 --> 01:10:51.329]  And open your eyes to a whole new world of cleanliness.
[01:10:59.787 --> 01:11:01.028]  Homeland cleanliness.
[01:11:01.328 --> 01:11:07.252]  Well, I like to give my listeners opportunities to hear sponsors that are based in reality.
[01:11:07.552 --> 01:11:11.715]  High quality films and books and materials to be informed and to save this country.
[01:11:12.075 --> 01:11:14.757]  High quality made in America or Britain if you choose.
[01:11:15.197 --> 01:11:17.759]  Water filtration systems that I personally use.
[01:11:18.119 --> 01:11:25.644]  And high quality, made in America, good old-fashioned soap that isn't made out of petrochemicals or pig tallow or beef tallow.
[01:11:26.024 --> 01:11:27.565]  Tell folks what's in your different soaps.
[01:11:27.605 --> 01:11:28.626]  Go over some of the products.
[01:11:28.886 --> 01:11:32.568]  Well, basically, we're only talking four basic products.
[01:11:33.109 --> 01:11:37.191]  Bath soap, hair soap, dish soap, and laundry soap.
[01:11:37.491 --> 01:11:40.733]  And they'll do 200 jobs with our book of instructions.
[01:11:41.174 --> 01:11:50.099]  Don't have to buy the window cleaner, and the floor cleaner, and the pre-soaps, and the after soaps, and the sweater wash, and all the chemicals, and solvents, and pastes.
[01:11:50.467 --> 01:11:54.429]  And liquids that do more harm than good and cost an arm and a leg.
[01:11:54.469 --> 01:12:03.513]  And the subs come triple concentrate and that's putting it lightly so you have little dispensers that we use in my home and my office that then dilute it for you.
[01:12:04.154 --> 01:12:04.814]  Exactly.
[01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:17.380]  It's a whole new world of cleanliness from 60 years ago that we as a family and we are a family owned company and I started this with my father in 1947 and we're still active
[01:12:20.134 --> 01:12:25.275]  And we really appreciate to do something for you that no one else is doing.
[01:12:25.495 --> 01:12:31.136]  And you've got the state of California organic certificates, which is the hardest in the 50 states to get.
[01:12:31.176 --> 01:12:33.937]  This is totally organic product.
[01:12:34.077 --> 01:12:35.797]  This is absolutely fabulous.
[01:12:35.817 --> 01:12:43.119]  And by the way, before we knew about you, we would go to Whole Foods and buy their organic soaps, which all
[01:12:44.172 --> 01:12:46.273]  I mean, compared to yours, stink to high heaven.
[01:12:46.854 --> 01:12:47.774]  I don't know what's in them.
[01:12:48.074 --> 01:12:50.516]  I can't believe your stuff isn't on their store shelves.
[01:12:50.936 --> 01:12:55.679]  And it costs like double or triple what the toxic detergents cost.
[01:12:56.119 --> 01:13:00.301]  How is yours organic, made in America, family owned, and it's 85% off?
[01:13:00.381 --> 01:13:01.082]  I know the answer.
[01:13:01.362 --> 01:13:02.923]  It's direct to the consumer.
[01:13:03.163 --> 01:13:04.084]  There's no middleman.
[01:13:04.404 --> 01:13:05.666]  Almost no advertising.
[01:13:05.926 --> 01:13:07.428]  Folks, you need to take advantage of this.
[01:13:07.488 --> 01:13:08.269]  Give Marty a call.
[01:13:08.289 --> 01:13:08.569]  800-340-7091.
[01:13:08.589 --> 01:13:08.949]  800-340-7091.
[01:13:08.969 --> 01:13:17.499]  If you hear this rebroadcast tonight or tomorrow morning, write it down.
[01:13:17.899 --> 01:13:18.900]  Call him tomorrow.
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:21.103]  Give him your business hours and also give out the websites.
[01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:26.391]  Did we lose, Marty?
[01:13:26.672 --> 01:13:27.052]  Oh, no!
[01:13:27.253 --> 01:13:27.393]  Oh!
[01:13:27.553 --> 01:13:28.895]  Oh, I thought you were still on!
[01:13:29.035 --> 01:13:36.584]  No, no, uh, well, I was saying to you, Marty... Website is Five Star... Soap.
[01:13:37.105 --> 01:13:39.268]  FiveStarsoap.com.
[01:13:40.143 --> 01:13:42.725]  Five the number or five the letter makes no difference.
[01:13:43.145 --> 01:13:45.427]  FiveStarsSoap.com.
[01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:46.928]  You'll see it all there.
[01:13:47.288 --> 01:13:50.250]  We're happy to share our good fortune with you.
[01:13:50.270 --> 01:13:55.794]  FiveStarsSoap.com or 1-800-340-7091.
[01:13:56.114 --> 01:13:58.836]  FiveStarsSoap.com or CalvinPureSoap.com.
[01:13:59.016 --> 01:14:05.680]  We have a big fat banner on the left hand side of Infowars.com over there and a text banner on PrisonPlanet.com or give them a call 800-340-7091.
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:06.080]  FiveStarsSoap.com.
[01:14:10.063 --> 01:14:12.084]  Marty, thank you for spending time with us again today.
[01:14:12.424 --> 01:14:12.764]  Thank you.
[01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:14.265]  I've just got a poem for you.
[01:14:14.625 --> 01:14:15.705]  I always love to hear them.
[01:14:16.146 --> 01:14:19.767]  I'm dedicating this to my hero, Alex Jones.
[01:14:19.927 --> 01:14:23.489]  A bee's a busy little soul.
[01:14:24.089 --> 01:14:26.790]  He has no time for birth control.
[01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:33.093]  That is why, in times like these, we have so many sons of bees.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:49.330]  Now, last week, or excuse me, last month when you were on with us, I didn't get the limerick or the pun or the joke about potato or tomato cans and Lincoln.
[01:14:49.630 --> 01:14:50.610]  None of us understood that.
[01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:52.211]  Can you break that down for us?
[01:14:52.271 --> 01:15:04.840]  In the 1800s, they think it's from one of the stories of Abraham Lincoln at that time, and it just goes like, drinking beer from a tomato can could never kill a man.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:09.963]  Drinking beer won't kill a man, but an old tomato can.
[01:15:11.624 --> 01:15:12.885]  Alright, now I get it Marty.
[01:15:13.766 --> 01:15:14.687]  Listen, God bless you.
[01:15:14.707 --> 01:15:15.247]  Good to talk to you.
[01:15:15.267 --> 01:15:16.228]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:15:16.328 --> 01:15:16.968]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:15:17.249 --> 01:15:17.429]  Bye.
[01:15:17.749 --> 01:15:18.570]  There goes Marty.
[01:15:18.850 --> 01:15:19.810]  He's just a character.
[01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:21.752]  And folks, it really is good soap.
[01:15:21.812 --> 01:15:25.014]  It really is a good quality product without all the toxic stuff.
[01:15:25.034 --> 01:15:32.420]  Give him a call 800-340-7091 or link through at Infowars.com there at the banner to their websites.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.120]  They've got two of them.
[01:15:34.637 --> 01:15:36.518]  Just call and get a free catalog, bare minimum.
[01:15:37.018 --> 01:15:38.539]  Let's go to Woody in Texas.
[01:15:38.599 --> 01:15:39.980]  Woody, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:40.620]  Thanks for holding.
[01:15:41.321 --> 01:15:41.981]  Hello, Alex.
[01:15:42.101 --> 01:15:42.401]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:42.822 --> 01:15:46.344]  I've got a quick comment on the vaccination and a question about the 9-11.
[01:15:46.424 --> 01:15:46.684]  Sure.
[01:15:46.704 --> 01:15:58.991]  The thing I heard from you that I'm glad you're taking up this issue on the vaccination because I have a daughter and I think Perry's just gone way overboard, you know, pushing this down our throats and I'm going to make sure she doesn't get that.
[01:16:00.011 --> 01:16:00.872]  So I thank you for that.
[01:16:01.900 --> 01:16:11.447]  The question I've got on the World Trade Center, I heard something a month or so ago where you mentioned an engineer in Texas who made a comment.
[01:16:11.787 --> 01:16:16.991]  You played a clip about him evaluating it and saying it was controlled demolition.
[01:16:17.031 --> 01:16:20.334]  And I'm an engineer myself, a structural engineer here in Austin.
[01:16:20.974 --> 01:16:25.357]  So I was kind of interested in that, you know, from a professional point of view.
[01:16:25.397 --> 01:16:26.438]  And I wondered if you could
[01:16:28.396 --> 01:16:32.639]  Give me some contact information so I might be able to talk to him a little bit about that.
[01:16:32.819 --> 01:16:33.800]  Well, I don't know.
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:38.164]  I have a good friend, Kevin Booth, who moved to California two years ago.
[01:16:38.764 --> 01:16:43.368]  He owns a big ranch with his sister out in Fredericksburg.
[01:16:44.508 --> 01:16:49.953]  I would go out there sometimes and hang out or go hunting or do whatever or ride horses.
[01:16:51.027 --> 01:16:52.948]  Look at their pigs in the backyard, you know, whatever.
[01:16:53.048 --> 01:16:53.649]  Pet the dog.
[01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:56.331]  And so I've known Jimmy Wright for years.
[01:16:56.531 --> 01:16:58.492]  That's his sister's husband.
[01:16:58.612 --> 01:16:59.533]  It's his brother-in-law.
[01:17:00.317 --> 01:17:07.181]  And he lives in New York half the time, the ranch the other half the time, and I haven't even seen Jimmy in about two years, but I know him real well.
[01:17:07.561 --> 01:17:14.825]  Jimmy was working in New York that day, so I called him and got him on, and that was Jimmy Wright as the towers had just collapsed.
[01:17:14.905 --> 01:17:16.966]  I mean, we had him on like an hour after they'd fallen.
[01:17:17.687 --> 01:17:25.211]  I mean, he worked at the World Financial Center literally a hundred yards away from the South and North Tower.
[01:17:26.047 --> 01:17:26.467]  We're good to go.
[01:17:40.065 --> 01:17:41.366]  Who saw their internal reports.
[01:17:41.386 --> 01:17:45.169]  They've done a year-long secret test, including it was basically impossible.
[01:17:45.749 --> 01:17:50.273]  And then there's been a bunch of other... You need to go to the Journal of 9-11 Studies.
[01:17:50.753 --> 01:17:51.814]  I believe it's .org.
[01:17:52.414 --> 01:17:54.276]  Dr. Steven Jones' group.
[01:17:54.616 --> 01:17:55.957]  There's hundreds of engineers.
[01:17:56.317 --> 01:17:59.619]  And a bunch of them are structural engineers on record.
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:02.581]  But I don't have Jimmy's number here at the office.
[01:18:02.662 --> 01:18:03.742]  I know it's at my house.
[01:18:04.723 --> 01:18:07.465]  But I don't really feel like I'm at liberty to hand out his phone number.
[01:18:08.371 --> 01:18:09.392]  Okay well I understand.
[01:18:09.432 --> 01:18:14.415]  Maybe you could give him my number sometime and if he has time he could give me a call.
[01:18:15.435 --> 01:18:16.296]  Well he was there.
[01:18:16.496 --> 01:18:22.159]  I mean he came on my show for like 30 minutes that day so his testament is on record.
[01:18:22.339 --> 01:18:25.981]  We were just playing some of the things I was saying day one on 9-11.
[01:18:26.401 --> 01:18:29.243]  I did eight hours of broadcast that day and they're all on the web.
[01:18:29.263 --> 01:18:30.244]  Somebody discovered them.
[01:18:30.264 --> 01:18:30.944]  We couldn't find them.
[01:18:31.835 --> 01:18:37.359]  What I still haven't been able to find is my July 25th program, Operation Expose the Government Terrorist.
[01:18:37.999 --> 01:18:39.860]  And I've been told there's people that have that out there.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:41.161]  Well, then send it in.
[01:18:41.181 --> 01:18:42.502]  Because we want it.
[01:18:42.842 --> 01:18:43.663]  Anything else, Woody?
[01:18:43.903 --> 01:18:44.543]  Well, that's it.
[01:18:44.683 --> 01:18:45.004]  Thank you.
[01:18:45.424 --> 01:18:45.844]  Thank you.
[01:18:46.404 --> 01:18:46.665]  Woody?
[01:18:47.125 --> 01:18:47.285]  Yes?
[01:18:47.565 --> 01:18:47.905]  Stay there.
[01:18:47.925 --> 01:18:49.446]  I want to ask you what it looked like to use.
[01:18:49.607 --> 01:18:50.167]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:52.603 --> 01:18:55.486]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:18:55.846 --> 01:18:58.709]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:18:58.949 --> 01:19:05.154]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:19:05.515 --> 01:19:12.841]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:19:13.021 --> 01:19:17.085]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:19:47.326 --> 01:19:54.928]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:19:55.348 --> 01:20:00.809]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.890]  That's right.
[01:20:02.210 --> 01:20:05.090]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:20:05.891 --> 01:20:11.972]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:20:12.532 --> 01:20:20.240]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:25.465]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:20:26.144 --> 01:20:31.166]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:31.946 --> 01:20:36.087]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:20:36.467 --> 01:20:36.727]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:36.747 --> 01:20:38.668]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:20:38.728 --> 01:20:39.048]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:20:39.328 --> 01:20:39.608]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:52.513 --> 01:20:54.975]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:55.696 --> 01:20:59.319]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[01:20:59.959 --> 01:21:03.842]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[01:21:04.543 --> 01:21:13.110]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[01:21:14.073 --> 01:21:21.276]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.

[01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:46.723]  Alright, welcome back.
[01:22:46.743 --> 01:22:49.084]  Just briefly, because I want to get to all the other callers.
[01:22:49.104 --> 01:22:49.845]  Thanks for holding, Woody.
[01:23:07.368 --> 01:23:15.293]  You say you're a structural engineer, looking at 9-11, looking at Building 7, collapsing the way it did with the central column falling and then imploding.
[01:23:15.834 --> 01:23:16.954]  What does it look like to you?
[01:23:18.295 --> 01:23:19.116]  I really couldn't say.
[01:23:19.136 --> 01:23:25.780]  It does have some similarities to a controlled demolition, but the report, I've been looking that over and I wanted to get more information.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:27.141]  The FEMA report, I mean.
[01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:30.043]  And it is a very complex building.
[01:23:30.083 --> 01:23:32.625]  The structural system has some unusual features in it.
[01:23:32.865 --> 01:23:34.106]  Well, you're talking about Tower 1 or 2 or 7?
[01:23:36.787 --> 01:23:37.608]  Both of them, actually.
[01:23:37.928 --> 01:23:52.283]  The two towers are unique for that time of construction, and seven also has some unique features in the way the columns are offset on the lower floors that makes it kind of vulnerable.
[01:23:53.857 --> 01:23:55.398]  But, you know, I wanted to get more information.
[01:23:55.458 --> 01:24:00.359]  What do you think about all the firefighters and police saying, we've been told to get back, they're going to bring it down, it's coming down?
[01:24:00.379 --> 01:24:01.200]  On building 7?
[01:24:01.240 --> 01:24:01.580]  Yeah.
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:07.822]  I did hear that clip, and it seemed like he was saying that there wasn't much hope to save it, and that they needed to get them out.
[01:24:07.882 --> 01:24:10.423]  There's a bunch of clips that have had other firemen and police on.
[01:24:10.443 --> 01:24:11.484]  We've got more coming on.
[01:24:11.504 --> 01:24:12.044]  Yeah.
[01:24:12.344 --> 01:24:18.306]  They're saying they were told to get back, they're going to bring it down, it's coming down, that building's going to blow up.
[01:24:18.706 --> 01:24:22.968]  And that other police were told they're bringing it down to save the other buildings.
[01:24:23.628 --> 01:24:26.210]  Could you set demolitions in a burning building?
[01:24:28.031 --> 01:24:29.372]  I'm not a demolition expert.
[01:24:29.412 --> 01:24:33.375]  That's why I was hoping that this engineer you had might have some more information on that.
[01:24:33.495 --> 01:24:37.899]  But what you were telling me seemed to be his first impression of it, of the thing.
[01:24:38.279 --> 01:24:39.019]  Yeah.
[01:24:39.039 --> 01:24:40.601]  No, no, we had him on.
[01:24:40.661 --> 01:24:46.165]  That was, I was re-airing like 30 minutes from my first hour I did on 9-11.
[01:24:46.645 --> 01:24:48.867]  And that was just a side issue that we had Jimmy on.
[01:24:49.287 --> 01:24:50.168]  I appreciate your call.
[01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:58.186]  Yeah, underwriting laboratories that underwrote the buildings said that it was nearly impossible.
[01:24:58.227 --> 01:25:01.008]  They couldn't understand how it happened, okay?
[01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:05.150]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Florida.
[01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:06.091]  George, you're on the air.
[01:25:06.871 --> 01:25:07.692]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:25:08.112 --> 01:25:08.392]  Good.
[01:25:08.452 --> 01:25:09.073]  What's on your mind?
[01:25:09.533 --> 01:25:13.415]  Well, first comment, I'd like to say George Bush is no more Christian than Anton LaVey.
[01:25:14.591 --> 01:25:16.171]  That's a guy from the Church of Satan.
[01:25:16.271 --> 01:25:24.333]  Who, by the way, I now have a video clip of him, an old film clip, saying they do mock human sacrifices, and that's what he tells Satanists to do.
[01:25:24.673 --> 01:25:26.354]  What are they doing at Bohemian Grove?
[01:25:27.234 --> 01:25:28.534]  Mock human sacrifices.
[01:25:28.814 --> 01:25:30.035]  It's very Christian.
[01:25:30.835 --> 01:25:39.617]  Yeah, but anyway, I'm one of those people, like I said, I live in Florida, and one thing I found out, my legislature is useless in this state.
[01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:51.287]  I'm trying to push for the repeal of the 17th Amendment, push for a resolution acknowledging that the 17th Amendment along with the 16th Amendment is not law.
[01:25:51.588 --> 01:25:53.811]  There's no law, no ratification.
[01:25:54.574 --> 01:25:55.155]  Well, that's right.
[01:25:55.195 --> 01:26:01.000]  They never properly ratified to give us an income tax, and they never properly ratified to take the Senators from the states.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:10.289]  Previously, the state legislatures that were elected by the people, then they would vote and appoint the Senators and could recall them, and it gave the states the Trump card.
[01:26:11.009 --> 01:26:25.974]  And it's just all part of this federalization and we need, there are moves by the way to reverse that, several states, what Arizona's looking at and so is Nevada at making their senators be elected by the legislature.
[01:26:26.794 --> 01:26:37.357]  Well, one thing I'd like to say to the Florida legislature, the only thing on their legislative agenda is basically make Viagra for seniors at discount prices from Canada.
[01:26:37.617 --> 01:26:39.978]  Yeah, it's more quote, benefits to pay the public off.
[01:26:41.576 --> 01:26:43.677]  Which is really a government payoff to Big Pharma.
[01:26:43.737 --> 01:26:44.597]  It's not for the people.
[01:26:44.617 --> 01:26:51.658]  They don't do any welfare program unless it helps the government and helps destroy families and helps make us dependent and centralize control.
[01:26:52.478 --> 01:26:54.198]  But it's not that they're useless.
[01:26:54.218 --> 01:26:55.279]  They're useless to you.
[01:26:55.699 --> 01:27:06.481]  For the big global corporations that own most legislatures, lock, stock and barrel, and then control many of the others, I mean, it's working quite well.
[01:27:06.501 --> 01:27:09.061]  I mean, when they say jump, they say, how high?
[01:27:10.168 --> 01:27:16.302]  Well right now it's more like the biggest crisis in Florida is the high prices for the homeowners insurance.
[01:27:17.104 --> 01:27:19.770]  And the homeowners insurance companies are backed up by bankers.
[01:27:20.365 --> 01:27:32.614]  Well, if people took the money, over 15 years on average, I've seen this broken down, of what you pay for insurance, and you've got 5% yield back on it, you could fix your home in almost all cases and end up with more money.
[01:27:32.994 --> 01:27:42.741]  By the way, the insurance companies, and I've talked to big claims adjusters and people that have worked the industry for a long time, they pay most of the 5, 10, 20 thousand dollar claims.
[01:27:43.042 --> 01:27:45.904]  But most of the claims above $100,000 don't get paid.
[01:27:46.704 --> 01:27:47.825]  Or they get them reduced.
[01:27:48.405 --> 01:27:49.006]  It's a scam.
[01:27:50.131 --> 01:27:50.431]  Mm-hmm.
[01:27:50.951 --> 01:27:58.613]  But the other thing that's on the legislative agenda is they find new and creative ways to suspend a person's license that don't have nothing to do with driving.
[01:27:59.533 --> 01:28:03.734]  They claim it's still a privilege and I haven't found nothing in the law in Florida that claims to see it's a privilege.
[01:28:03.894 --> 01:28:05.934]  You know, that's a policy.
[01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:10.615]  It's like Rick Perry says, you've got to take the vaccine, it's the law.
[01:28:10.895 --> 01:28:14.976]  There's no law, it's a policy, a directive of the state health department
[01:28:15.456 --> 01:28:20.861]  To say it's recommended, then the school says you have to with no law.
[01:28:21.221 --> 01:28:22.842]  Driving is not a privilege.
[01:28:23.143 --> 01:28:28.427]  The Supreme Court and state courts have ruled, but they tell the cops it is, so they parrot it.
[01:28:28.707 --> 01:28:33.671]  Just like when the cops come with CPS to take your children because you didn't vaccinate, there's no law.
[01:28:33.912 --> 01:28:37.675]  They still take your children because they're total scum.
[01:28:42.334 --> 01:28:45.315]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.335 --> 01:28:49.017]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.398 --> 01:28:54.499]  Hey Jane, how's it going?
[01:28:54.859 --> 01:28:56.800]  Gosh, I'm not doing so well.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.981]  Even though I'm doing everything I'm supposed to do, my blood sugar is way out of control.
[01:29:01.481 --> 01:29:03.162]  Oh Jane, I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:29:03.422 --> 01:29:05.463]  I have to monitor my blood sugar again.
[01:29:08.047 --> 01:29:10.849]  That would help control my blood sugar that really works.
[01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:12.550]  Have you tried Sucroblast?
[01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:18.373]  For millions of Americans who can't keep their high blood sugar levels off their minds, there's Sucroblast.
[01:29:18.933 --> 01:29:23.295]  Sucroblast is the all-natural way to help keep your high blood sugar levels under control.

[01:29:43.018 --> 01:29:46.879]  I'm going to call Sucreblast to set up a free consultation right now!
[01:29:47.219 --> 01:29:49.300]  Excellent Jane, you'll be glad you did.
[01:29:52.441 --> 01:29:54.242]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:55.582]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:29:55.803 --> 01:29:58.644]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:29:59.004 --> 01:30:01.725]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:30:02.288 --> 01:30:09.035]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:30:51.548 --> 01:30:54.249]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:30:54.529 --> 01:30:56.590]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:59.351]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[01:30:59.791 --> 01:31:04.153]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there's a very real chance that you'll now be able to do it.
[01:31:04.273 --> 01:31:04.853]  Here's why.
[01:31:04.873 --> 01:31:11.476]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[01:31:11.776 --> 01:31:18.264]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating, but they're not.
[01:31:18.424 --> 01:31:22.148]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[01:31:22.369 --> 01:31:26.594]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[01:31:27.074 --> 01:31:34.259]  Learn how to finally teach those financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:35.420]  Get control.
[01:31:35.540 --> 01:31:36.141]  Get relief.
[01:31:36.341 --> 01:31:37.101]  Get some sleep.
[01:31:37.381 --> 01:31:38.382]  Go to www.outand90.com.
[01:31:38.422 --> 01:31:39.343]  That's www.outand90.com.
[01:31:39.463 --> 01:31:39.943]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[01:31:40.163 --> 01:31:40.404]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:31:40.444 --> 01:31:41.644]  Well, you were sleeping.
[01:31:58.240 --> 01:32:02.903]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here live.
[01:32:28.829 --> 01:32:30.451]  Don't forget, I'm a documentary filmmaker.
[01:32:30.511 --> 01:32:31.572]  I've made 15 films.
[01:32:31.632 --> 01:32:35.735]  The latest is Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:32:36.036 --> 01:32:43.042]  The film starts with 30 minutes of our government admitting they've staged terror attacks to blame it on foreign enemies and start wars.
[01:32:43.362 --> 01:32:45.444]  Then we'd go into 7-7 in London.
[01:32:45.945 --> 01:32:47.226]  We were there right after it happened.
[01:32:47.246 --> 01:32:54.913]  9-11, the latest developments, the Iraq War, the staged intelligence, the build-up to the attack on Iran.
[01:32:55.891 --> 01:32:56.972]  It is really my best film.
[01:32:57.012 --> 01:32:58.012]  People are blown away by it.
[01:32:58.292 --> 01:33:09.418]  Have it on DVD plus the 68 minutes of extras from the 9-11 Neocon Agenda 9-11 Summit that we had out in California that over 1,200 people attended last year.
[01:33:09.458 --> 01:33:15.801]  That's the extras over three hours on one DVD available at Infowars.com.
[01:33:15.821 --> 01:33:17.222]  Get America Freedom to Fascism.
[01:33:17.542 --> 01:33:19.823]  And when you get it, you can get Terror Storm for half price.
[01:33:20.324 --> 01:33:24.626]  We've launched a bunch of new products that I'll tell you about briefly in the next hour.
[01:33:25.973 --> 01:33:44.788]  About six, seven years ago, I'll just briefly do it, I had a much smaller staff and could never get a lot of things done I wanted to because my friend Rod Moses, who used to do the streaming for Genesis, sold on a site, he doesn't anymore, these transmitters that were something like half a watt.
[01:33:44.808 --> 01:33:49.311]  They'd cover your whole neighborhood that you could plug into your computer, but it was a card.
[01:33:50.212 --> 01:33:54.976]  Well, we found some units, and we're going to carry several other brands too, but we've got one up there right now,
[01:33:55.812 --> 01:34:00.455]  That goes out about 100 feet unobstructed, about 40 to 70 feet inside a building.
[01:34:00.755 --> 01:34:04.498]  So it would go up a few floors inside an office building or inside an apartment building.
[01:34:05.299 --> 01:34:06.920]  You can pick a frequency that's open.
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.823]  That's better to pick one on the dial that doesn't have another station on it, then it'll go out twice as far.
[01:34:12.423 --> 01:34:17.687]  And I was told by the company that produced this that you can then get like an FM
[01:34:18.743 --> 01:34:19.243]  We're good to go!
[01:34:36.929 --> 01:34:37.549]  Plug it in.
[01:34:37.969 --> 01:34:40.090]  It'll go all over your house and into your yard.
[01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:41.891]  It's water resistant.
[01:34:41.911 --> 01:34:46.992]  You can even stick it right outside your window under an eave and it would broadcast further down the street.
[01:34:47.372 --> 01:34:51.554]  You can even tell four or five of your neighbors, hey, you can hear this little station right around here locally.
[01:34:51.834 --> 01:34:52.754]  You can just plug it in.
[01:34:52.794 --> 01:35:05.618]  It's perfect for people that have computers that have a cable modem because you can just leave the computer on and just stream the internet 24-7 for free off of InfoWars.com.
[01:35:06.318 --> 01:35:07.179]  We've tested these.
[01:35:25.751 --> 01:35:26.232]  I don't know.
[01:35:38.433 --> 01:35:39.254]  They're $69.
[01:35:39.874 --> 01:35:44.717]  They're up on Infowars.com and that's the lowest price we've seen on them.
[01:35:44.737 --> 01:35:44.717]  $69.
[01:35:44.897 --> 01:35:47.199]  Great little FM transmitters.
[01:35:47.599 --> 01:35:53.443]  You can drop by Radio Shack and for $20 buy an FM antenna that clips onto it and strings out.
[01:35:53.483 --> 01:35:54.644]  And you can double or triple.
[01:35:54.964 --> 01:35:56.905]  People played with this and gotten different results.
[01:35:56.945 --> 01:35:57.786]  You can tinker with it.
[01:35:58.226 --> 01:36:00.407]  But it's just a great system.
[01:36:00.467 --> 01:36:01.628]  It's FCC approved.
[01:36:02.008 --> 01:36:03.890]  Get it today at Infowars.com.
[01:36:05.482 --> 01:36:08.804]  You can also call toll free to get all my films, the books, the videos we carry.
[01:36:08.824 --> 01:36:10.926]  It's not just our titles by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:36:10.946 --> 01:36:12.307]  You can also write to us.
[01:36:17.313 --> 01:36:27.016]  to get the FM transmitter or the films or the books at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:36:28.456 --> 01:36:29.636]  So take advantage of that.
[01:36:30.076 --> 01:36:37.958]  Also we're adding four new, three of them are 9-11 videos, one of them is a great film about the Iraq War.
[01:36:38.098 --> 01:36:44.280]  Four new films are going up on the website tonight on the secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:36:46.138 --> 01:37:05.142]  Danny, Paul, Ryan, and others, we're going to get to your calls here in a few minutes, but first I want to go to Leland Lerman, who runs a great website, mothermedia.org, and it's a very well done site, done kind of a newspaper style, I guess it's kind of like a PDF file.
[01:37:05.742 --> 01:37:07.983]  Very good to print out and distribute to people.
[01:37:08.869 --> 01:37:10.390]  Oh, it's great to be here, Alex.
[01:37:34.947 --> 01:37:49.218]  Just in a thumbnail sketch, nutshell, tell us about yourself, about the website, and how important this fight in New Mexico is, because we just saw one state pull out of the National ID Card, Real ID Act, and now 36 have signed on to do it.
[01:37:49.899 --> 01:37:52.981]  We've now seen a couple of states pass laws against RFID.
[01:37:53.362 --> 01:37:57.365]  Now 40 plus other states, including Texas, are introducing legislation.
[01:37:57.765 --> 01:38:04.430]  Legislation just got introduced in the Legislature of Texas to block biometric face scanning cameras being used by the police.
[01:38:04.690 --> 01:38:09.193]  My point is, we can win at the local level and cause domino effects.
[01:38:09.553 --> 01:38:15.197]  Over 600 counties and cities and several states, what six states now, have thrown out the Patriot Act.
[01:38:15.517 --> 01:38:17.078]  Tell us about what we can do here.
[01:38:18.098 --> 01:38:30.306]  Well, in 2004, when the election was stolen in Ohio, I and my colleagues grafted around for ideas, and we realized that states control the process of election systems and technology.
[01:38:30.726 --> 01:38:38.011]  And so we went to the state legislature, and over the course of two years, we secured the first all-paper ballot law in New Mexico.
[01:38:38.231 --> 01:38:42.614]  All elections are now mandatory on paper with optical scanning machines.
[01:38:42.674 --> 01:38:45.016]  Therefore, you can recount them by hand if necessary.
[01:38:45.703 --> 01:38:47.845]  So you took action, had a major victory.
[01:38:48.165 --> 01:38:48.766]  Right, exactly.
[01:38:49.226 --> 01:38:58.234]  So I was thrilled, and I noticed that legislators at the state level and also at the national level enormously in need of citizen support for important initiatives.
[01:38:58.475 --> 01:39:01.778]  And I was entirely taken aback by the fact
[01:39:03.038 --> 01:39:07.181]  That they did not give me any problems with coming to their offices and asking them for their time.
[01:39:07.762 --> 01:39:11.365]  And, in fact, sometimes they would turn around and ask me for their support on other things.
[01:39:11.485 --> 01:39:25.896]  So I found out that, ultimately, the citizens in the United States of America have way more power than they think, and the lack of initiative at actually getting into the state capitol buildings is most of the problem that the population faces.
[01:39:27.137 --> 01:39:43.833]  After that victory and the subsequent ongoing breaches of the Constitution by the Executive Branch, I determined that it was necessary to attempt to bring impeachment proceedings against the President, and I was very excited to find that one could do so in a state legislature.
[01:39:43.873 --> 01:39:46.176]  This is the key point for people to understand.
[01:39:46.756 --> 01:40:03.185]  Impeachment proceedings can be brought by state legislatures under Jefferson's Rules of the House, Section 603, and you can get a very good rundown on the entire Jefferson's Rules of the House, the manual of parliamentary procedure that's been used for the last 200 years.
[01:40:04.425 --> 01:40:06.947]  Uh, at impeachbush.tv.
[01:40:07.427 --> 01:40:12.891]  They also had a terrific resolution that was tailored specifically to states and invokes Jefferson's rules of the House.
[01:40:13.431 --> 01:40:15.533]  I modified it for the purposes of New Mexico.
[01:40:15.653 --> 01:40:25.760]  I brought it to my favorite state senator, Jerry Ortiz Pino, after reading a couple of editorials in the mainstream press, including Louis Lapham's editorial in favor of impeachment, and I believe John Nichols.
[01:40:29.442 --> 01:40:34.366]  Well, we've got to stop Bush.
[01:40:34.406 --> 01:40:39.670]  He's clearly a puppet, but the people that are behind him literally could turn out being worse than Hitler.
[01:40:39.710 --> 01:40:40.851]  They're going for broke.
[01:40:40.911 --> 01:40:43.933]  We've got to preemptively remove this criminal now.
[01:40:44.313 --> 01:40:48.316]  Yeah, that's exactly how we feel and we're all, everybody's all in an enormous leak.
[01:40:48.917 --> 01:40:49.818]  We're good to go.
[01:41:02.061 --> 01:41:09.726]  And ultimately defusing all popular support for any bogus war in a foreign nation.
[01:41:09.826 --> 01:41:16.550]  And even Zbigniew Brzezinski, globalist architect, is saying that the government may stage an event in the U.S.
[01:41:16.590 --> 01:41:17.811]  to blame it on Iran.
[01:41:18.071 --> 01:41:20.573]  That was two and a half weeks ago before the Senate.
[01:41:20.993 --> 01:41:22.294]  I mean, this is getting serious.
[01:41:22.494 --> 01:41:25.216]  Well, Zbig would know, and as we know, some
[01:41:26.197 --> 01:41:32.209]  Elderly statesmen like Spigney F. Brzezinski and Admiral Chester Ward is a very important
[01:41:34.262 --> 01:41:57.279]  Precursor to Zbig, they join the Council on Foreign Relations because it's, you know, exciting, and it's elite, and it appears to have the stamp of approval of the international community, and ultimately they find out that the program is diabolical, and if it weren't for Chester Ward, we would not know, from an insider's perspective, that the Council on Foreign Relations is dedicated to the destruction of the sovereignty of the United States of America.
[01:41:57.919 --> 01:42:13.646]  I think it's possible that Zbigniew Brzezinski is, in his later years, actually beginning to question all that he has served all these years, and there can be no question that his blame on Iran has a subtext that will not have been perpetrated by Iran.
[01:42:14.446 --> 01:42:15.366]  No, that's what he said.
[01:42:15.406 --> 01:42:16.947]  He's clearly saying a staged event.
[01:42:16.967 --> 01:42:17.767]  We've got the quote.
[01:42:19.824 --> 01:42:27.090]  Specifically, how far have you gotten the impeachment proceedings right now with the resolution being introduced in New Mexico?
[01:42:27.570 --> 01:42:32.513]  Well, we were thrilled at the massive numbers of citizens who showed up for the introduction.
[01:42:32.533 --> 01:42:37.237]  We were similarly thrilled when even more people showed up for our first committee hearing in rules.
[01:42:37.917 --> 01:42:41.240]  In rules, we won 5-0 in a straight party-line vote.
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:44.342]  None of the Republicans even came to the hearing.
[01:42:45.122 --> 01:42:48.705]  One could say they're panicked or they're trying to
[01:42:49.853 --> 01:42:54.657]  They're trying to put the proceedings down and make it something that's a non-issue.
[01:42:54.677 --> 01:42:56.638]  That was their explicit statement in the press.
[01:42:56.658 --> 01:42:58.480]  They didn't want to dignify it with a comment.
[01:42:59.939 --> 01:43:19.088]  But the people who are actually pushing the impeachment resolution forward are extremely active, and I have here in the Roundhouse with me today several excellent activists, David Luckey, Terrence McCarthy, Arwin Gwyneth, and we have people on the ground here finding the Senators, pulling them off the floor, asking for their vote, asking them to go and talk to the swing votes.
[01:43:19.128 --> 01:43:24.490]  We are doing absolutely everything that we possibly can to get our upcoming vote in public affairs through.
[01:43:25.149 --> 01:43:35.835]  We have a difficulty because a very conservative district, or so-called conservative district, down in Las Cruces is typically aligned with the Republicans.
[01:43:36.354 --> 01:43:43.978]  Senator Mary Kay Papin, however, has moved from not going to support the resolution to taking everything under advisement.
[01:43:44.038 --> 01:44:02.348]  So we have actually pushed the swing vote back up onto the fence, and we think that with another excellent turnout in public affairs, we will be able to convince Senator Mary Kay Papin from the Las Cruces, as well as the Aztec Senator, I believe he's Aztec, from Grant, David Ulibarri.
[01:44:04.248 --> 01:44:09.133]  And again, that's the name of his region, his Aztec?
[01:44:09.534 --> 01:44:11.535]  He's an Aztec Indian.
[01:44:11.576 --> 01:44:12.617]  He is a Native American.
[01:44:13.137 --> 01:44:15.960]  And his region... Okay, when you said Aztec, I didn't know what you were talking about.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:16.680]  Okay, I got you now.
[01:44:16.841 --> 01:44:23.907]  Well, there is an Aztec region of New Mexico, but this gentleman, David Ulibarri, Senator David Ulibarri, has not... Now I understand.
[01:44:23.948 --> 01:44:24.528]  Now I understand.
[01:44:24.568 --> 01:44:26.290]  I thought you were saying that was his district.
[01:44:26.710 --> 01:44:30.912]  Now, again, we need to get this going in other states as well.
[01:44:31.273 --> 01:44:32.613]  Well, we have it going in other states.
[01:44:32.693 --> 01:44:35.575]  Both Vermont and Washington have impeachment resolutions moving.
[01:44:35.995 --> 01:44:50.563]  In our state, in New Mexico, we got eight senators to sign on to the original introduction, including the majority whip, Senator Mary Jane Garcia, also from Doña Ana County, and we've been asking her to please go talk to her colleague from the region, Mary Kay Papin, for asking for her vote.
[01:44:50.923 --> 01:44:55.326]  Now, in Vermont, there were 20 representatives who signed on to the impeachment resolution.
[01:44:55.946 --> 01:45:01.632]  That resolution looks to be facing difficulty in judiciary, just as we are facing difficulty in public affairs.
[01:45:01.653 --> 01:45:17.730]  And that's not how these legislatures are supposed to work, but they've changed the rules over the hundreds of years, where you can just have a few committee chairmen block everything, and you've got the junior legislators and the junior congressmen and women, and it becomes another centralized system.
[01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:19.841]  Well, there's something to that.
[01:45:19.901 --> 01:45:26.465]  However, our fortunate position is that the chairman of all the committees through which we have to go have signed our bill.
[01:45:27.126 --> 01:45:28.347]  So they are not blocking.
[01:45:28.387 --> 01:45:30.328]  In fact, they are expediting passage of this bill.
[01:45:30.348 --> 01:45:36.312]  However, I will tell you that the impeachment resolution is the equivalent of a nuclear football in the New Mexico legislature.
[01:45:36.372 --> 01:45:42.095]  The majority leader on the House side, Ken Martinez, says that he supports it in principle, but he doesn't want it to be a showstopper.
[01:45:42.496 --> 01:45:46.338]  The New Mexico legislature, because it's not a very rich state, does not go full-time.
[01:45:46.718 --> 01:45:47.599]  We only have
[01:45:48.684 --> 01:45:52.867]  Sixty days in order to get legislation passed, and then we have to wait until the next year.
[01:45:52.907 --> 01:45:53.767]  Sure, I understand.
[01:45:53.807 --> 01:45:56.989]  Well, nothing's more important than impeaching Bush.
[01:45:57.009 --> 01:46:08.236]  They stall all the time, they filibuster endlessly, and they didn't even show up to the committee hearing, and we offered them an extra week before we would hear the bill if they would come and show up, but they still didn't show up, even though we offered them an extra week.
[01:46:08.476 --> 01:46:15.901]  What about Council on Foreign Relations Bilderberg Group attendee and Bohemian Grove Governor Bill Richardson?
[01:46:16.935 --> 01:46:20.477]  Governor Richardson, unfortunately, is completely out of the picture on this.
[01:46:20.517 --> 01:46:30.042]  We do keep him informed of the topic, but we neither expect his support nor do we need it because it's a Senate joint resolution and it does not require the signature.
[01:46:30.062 --> 01:46:32.684]  But if the governor came out in support of it, that would certainly help.
[01:46:33.667 --> 01:46:34.127]  Oh, of course.
[01:46:34.167 --> 01:46:35.988]  I mean, everybody wants to know what the governor thinks.
[01:46:36.048 --> 01:46:44.292]  I mean, if you go to talk to Senator Bingaman's people, or Representative Udall's people, or Senator Altamirano's people, they always want to know what the governor has to say.
[01:46:44.492 --> 01:46:49.635]  I've been asking for a statement from the governor, but since he's running for president, I don't expect anything.
[01:46:51.039 --> 01:46:57.964]  Well, we have to impeach Bush alone for lying about WMDs, for trying to dissolve our borders.
[01:46:58.384 --> 01:47:04.849]  You know, I didn't know this about you, Leland Lerman, but your dad wrote that first book with Ron Paul over 30 years ago?
[01:47:05.169 --> 01:47:16.818]  You know, I'm really glad that you bring that up because my relationship with my family politically is extremely sensitive as a result of the fact that although we share some ground in the paleoconservative realm, my father has
[01:47:18.242 --> 01:47:19.003]  I think?
[01:47:35.131 --> 01:47:36.532]  How could anybody now support the war?
[01:47:36.572 --> 01:47:42.997]  Bush lied on every front telling the troops they'd be back by Christmas, but the documents come out they plan to have them there 30 years.
[01:47:43.057 --> 01:47:44.058]  It's just endless lying.
[01:47:57.788 --> 01:48:14.219]  You know, I took a look at the New York Sun, which is a newspaper that my dad reads, and it's a neoconservative newspaper, and they recently published an editorial attempting to exonerate Doug Fyfe based on a new General Accounting Office report, and I don't know how they do it.
[01:48:14.479 --> 01:48:19.603]  They somehow managed to wrap themselves in the flag, or some other type of ideology,
[01:48:20.745 --> 01:48:22.966]  Regardless of whether or not it's an ideology.
[01:48:22.986 --> 01:48:26.408]  But the people running this war are the ones destroying our sovereignty.
[01:48:28.089 --> 01:48:34.432]  I completely understand that, which is why I've kept my father informed about Ron Paul's run for president.
[01:48:34.512 --> 01:48:37.674]  I've asked him if he would please support Ron Paul's run for president.
[01:48:39.115 --> 01:48:44.097]  But I'm afraid that some of my dad's alliances are very old.
[01:48:46.824 --> 01:48:51.788]  He's a Yale University class of 1960, and he knows many of the major players.
[01:48:51.808 --> 01:48:58.073]  Sure, I mean, this is his friends, this is his culture, and that's how a lot of people get, you know, drug along into all of this.
[01:48:59.014 --> 01:49:01.096]  In closing, how do we support you?
[01:49:01.156 --> 01:49:05.119]  How do we help the New Mexicans get this impeachment through?
[01:49:05.559 --> 01:49:10.303]  All New Mexicans need to call Senator Mary K. Papin and Senator David Ulibarri.
[01:49:10.703 --> 01:49:13.105]  You can call the New Mexico State House at 986-505-4000.
[01:49:15.691 --> 01:49:19.254]  9-8-6-4-3-0-0 and ask for any Senator you want.
[01:49:19.294 --> 01:49:21.996]  We also need support with the Majority Leader Michael Sanchez.
[01:49:22.537 --> 01:49:26.200]  Once again, call Senators Mary Kay Papen and David Ulibarri at 505-9-8-6-4-3-0-0.
[01:49:29.597 --> 01:49:34.081]  And then briefly, the procedure, if you were able to get New Mexico to do this, it would then kick it off?
[01:49:34.421 --> 01:49:35.062]  Yes, it will.
[01:49:35.102 --> 01:49:39.686]  All we need is one member of the House, and there's three that I've got in my sights.
[01:49:39.806 --> 01:49:42.969]  One who was already introduced in the future resolution of the Minnesota State Legislature.
[01:49:43.009 --> 01:49:46.652]  We think somebody in the Federal House will pick it up if it passes through the Senate.
[01:49:46.692 --> 01:49:47.112]  Stay there!
[01:49:47.172 --> 01:49:50.255]  Briefly on the other side, I need to go to calls, but I want to talk about the procedure here.
[01:49:55.347 --> 01:49:58.550]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:58.891 --> 01:50:00.792]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:01.193 --> 01:50:08.780]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:09.528 --> 01:50:16.592]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:16.972 --> 01:50:28.418]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:28.718 --> 01:50:32.360]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:32.661 --> 01:50:34.602]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:34.942 --> 01:50:38.784]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:52.057 --> 01:50:55.059]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:55.379 --> 01:51:00.303]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:00.563 --> 01:51:04.926]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:05.206 --> 01:51:14.132]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:14.332 --> 01:51:17.935]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:18.235 --> 01:51:23.280]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:23.560 --> 01:51:30.266]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:30.774 --> 01:51:31.435]  What about you?

[01:52:46.086 --> 01:52:48.587]  George Bush can be impeached.
[01:52:48.647 --> 01:53:00.933]  There's talk at the federal level and movements at the state level.
[01:53:14.625 --> 01:53:16.267]  And I don't want to hear we can't do it.
[01:53:16.627 --> 01:53:19.370]  We might as well just roll over and die if we're going to have that attitude.
[01:53:21.292 --> 01:53:24.455]  Leland Lerman is our guest from mothermedia.org.
[01:53:25.056 --> 01:53:33.184]  In closing, can you go through the procedures, either the federal procedure or the state procedure to remove this would-be dictator?
[01:53:34.072 --> 01:53:40.338]  Sure, everybody should take a look at the impeachbush.tv website for the details, but the basics are this.
[01:53:40.818 --> 01:53:48.685]  If the resolution passes a single state legislature, it is then sent under seal of that state's secretary of state and sent to the federal
[01:53:49.346 --> 01:54:01.911]  House of Representatives in Washington where, under Jefferson's rules of the House, only one member of Congress needs to introduce that resolution with requests for impeachment proceeding privilege.
[01:54:02.231 --> 01:54:07.173]  Impeachment proceedings are a privileged proceeding under parliamentary procedure.
[01:54:07.253 --> 01:54:10.595]  In other words, if there's reason to impeach, all other business
[01:54:11.155 --> 01:54:11.976]  We're good to go.
[01:54:26.571 --> 01:54:47.443]  So, we are hoping that Representative Ron Paul will invoke our resolution, Representative Tom Udall is a sort of distant hope, and then there's a senator, a representative from Minnesota who introduced an impeachment resolution in the state legislature in Minnesota and subsequently went on to be elected to the National House of Representatives, and we're also hoping that he would help us.
[01:54:48.303 --> 01:54:50.805]  But we still have a long way to get through here in New Mexico.
[01:54:51.678 --> 01:54:58.747]  Now, the impeachment privilege will only give us one hour of mandatory debate on the floor.
[01:54:59.228 --> 01:55:05.095]  Nevertheless, we consider that a significant public relations as well as procedural victory.
[01:55:05.856 --> 01:55:09.561]  And furthermore, once the resolution hits the House floor,
[01:55:10.385 --> 01:55:22.641]  Uh, whether or not it gets impeachment privilege proceedings, it will immediately get assigned to the House Judiciary Committee where John Conyers has already written a massive dossier on impeachable offenses.
[01:55:23.342 --> 01:55:27.428]  So, we think that although Conyers has suggested that he's more interested right now in
[01:55:28.028 --> 01:55:33.609]  Ending the war in Iraq and preventing war with Iran, we think that Conyers is very sympathetic to impeachment.
[01:55:33.649 --> 01:55:39.471]  We just think that it's a second priority after preventing war with Iran and pulling out of Iraq.
[01:55:39.511 --> 01:55:54.234]  Bill Clinton needed to be impeached for lying to a grand jury and impeached for missile secrets and murders and all the rest of it, but compared to George Bush, and I supported the impeachment of Clinton, we must have an impeachment
[01:55:55.536 --> 01:55:56.076]  Of Bush.
[01:55:56.717 --> 01:55:58.137]  Some will say he's just a puppet.
[01:55:58.157 --> 01:55:59.318]  We'll just get Democrats.
[01:55:59.398 --> 01:56:00.078]  It doesn't matter.
[01:56:00.098 --> 01:56:01.258]  Then we'll impeach them.
[01:56:01.278 --> 01:56:01.899]  Right.
[01:56:02.059 --> 01:56:02.839]  Absolutely.
[01:56:03.279 --> 01:56:07.421]  There's no question that we will... We are not trying to put Nancy Pelosi in office.
[01:56:07.481 --> 01:56:08.281]  It will never happen.
[01:56:08.321 --> 01:56:12.983]  The Vice President will resign and the President will appoint a new Vice President and the Vice President will become President.
[01:56:13.003 --> 01:56:16.785]  The point is you cannot allow a precedent like this to pass.
[01:56:18.965 --> 01:56:21.488]  It absolutely must be addressed at the federal level.
[01:56:22.049 --> 01:56:25.893]  Nobody can violate the Constitution and be found guilty in federal court.
[01:56:25.953 --> 01:56:33.762]  In ACLU v. National Security Agency, Judge Anna Diggs-Taylor of Detroit District Court, Federal District Court, found that the Bush Administration
[01:56:34.002 --> 01:56:36.924]  Well, he also signed a secret agreement, SPP, in March of 2005.
[01:56:36.964 --> 01:56:38.305]  We've now gotten segments of that.
[01:56:38.445 --> 01:56:39.066]  It's high treason.
[01:56:39.106 --> 01:56:40.487]  He has destroyed the United States.
[01:56:56.175 --> 01:57:08.645]  Well, you know, I've went around and around with some of the people in the 9-11 truth movement on whether or not it was essential to put a treason charge in the impeachment proceedings, and the general consensus was that it would divide the constituency.
[01:57:08.825 --> 01:57:14.110]  So although I mentioned the fact that 9-11 was a pretext for a pre-planned aggressive war on
[01:57:15.229 --> 01:57:18.651]  Afghanistan and the South Asian region.
[01:57:19.391 --> 01:57:23.414]  I do so with deference to our other constituents who are convinced.
[01:57:23.594 --> 01:57:23.774]  Sure.
[01:57:23.874 --> 01:57:26.175]  Leland Lerman, our prayers go with you.
[01:57:26.655 --> 01:57:28.276]  Everybody should support what you're doing.
[01:57:28.316 --> 01:57:29.237]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:57:29.837 --> 01:57:30.437]  Thank you, sir.

[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:51.062]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:51.783 --> 01:57:52.904]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:53.545 --> 01:57:54.366]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.127 --> 01:57:56.109]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.690 --> 01:58:00.575]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:00.876 --> 01:58:04.942]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.287 --> 01:58:10.731]  Dr. William Beagle is going to be joining us coming up in about seven minutes for the balance of the show.
[01:58:10.751 --> 01:58:19.538]  We'll cover a host of issues starting out with this live cancer virus vaccine, getting into the war, getting into the British troop withdrawal, so much more.
[01:58:19.558 --> 01:58:23.902]  But right now, let's get some of these calls out of the way they've been holding.
[01:58:24.322 --> 01:58:27.104]  Danny in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[01:58:27.184 --> 01:58:29.126]  Then Paula, Ryan, and others.
[01:58:29.166 --> 01:58:29.746]  Go ahead, Danny.
[01:58:30.347 --> 01:58:30.827]  Hi, Alex.
[01:58:30.947 --> 01:58:32.329]  It's great to talk to you again, man.
[01:58:32.509 --> 01:58:33.169]  Good to talk to you.
[01:58:33.309 --> 01:58:33.990]  Always an honor.
[01:58:34.623 --> 01:58:38.705]  Um, I want to start off by, uh, saying thank you to Christina Ebersole.
[01:58:38.865 --> 01:58:42.166]  That was a wonderful interview and it took great courage.
[01:58:42.706 --> 01:58:53.151]  And I just want to, uh, make a couple of points, uh, related to the caller you had from Key West about, you know, pointing out the, the real criminals and the big boys behind all of this.
[01:58:53.851 --> 01:58:54.871]  That has been done.
[01:58:55.132 --> 01:59:03.455]  You know, I want to reference people to go ahead and look for your work, you know, where you, where you had the big morning, uh, protest session over there in Ottawa.
[01:59:04.369 --> 01:59:06.691]  That's one of my favorite pieces of work of yours.
[01:59:06.751 --> 01:59:08.052]  I mean, it's excellent.
[01:59:08.692 --> 01:59:13.275]  I mean, you capped off that session, you know, by saying you have been defeated.
[01:59:13.295 --> 01:59:14.476]  And that's in my heart.
[01:59:14.536 --> 01:59:15.137]  I believe that.
[01:59:15.697 --> 01:59:18.239]  When you spoke all those words, that came from God.
[01:59:18.759 --> 01:59:19.720]  God spoke through you.
[01:59:20.401 --> 01:59:24.023]  And, you know, that's the one really who's helping us to defeat this.
[01:59:24.043 --> 01:59:24.483]  That's God.
[01:59:24.523 --> 01:59:27.065]  Everybody's got to keep that in their mind and in their heart and their soul.
[01:59:27.205 --> 01:59:27.866]  Amen to that.
[01:59:28.699 --> 01:59:38.101]  And with that covered, Joe, people should go look into that if they haven't seen it, and then also the Aaron Russo interview that you recently put online.
[01:59:38.301 --> 01:59:39.482]  About Nick Rockefeller?
[01:59:39.662 --> 01:59:42.563]  Yes, right there, 11 months before 9-11.
[01:59:42.783 --> 01:59:45.803]  Oh, by the way, we're going to put that scan up on JonesReport.com.
[01:59:46.163 --> 01:59:48.824]  Aaron sent us a photo of him with Nick Rockefeller.
[01:59:49.084 --> 01:59:51.565]  That's going up on JonesReport.com the next hour.
[01:59:52.005 --> 01:59:55.666]  That was an excellent piece of work right there, and I pushed that on my little blogger.
[01:59:56.641 --> 01:59:59.223]  Right now, I'm trying to get a real good site up and running.
[01:59:59.263 --> 02:00:01.044]  I'll call you again when I get that going.
[02:00:01.084 --> 02:00:01.985]  It's going to be like a portal.
[02:00:02.525 --> 02:00:05.087]  I'm trying to get some more stuff in there and get it all set up.
[02:00:05.107 --> 02:00:08.690]  It's a lot of work, but I'm going to have a lot of links for people and information.
[02:00:09.951 --> 02:00:12.112]  I encourage people to go look at that information.
[02:00:12.493 --> 02:00:22.360]  With that, I also want to say that people are always saying, hey, they want to look for someone to defeat this overnight.
[02:00:22.440 --> 02:00:24.141]  It's not going to happen just like you said earlier.
[02:00:24.981 --> 02:00:26.623]  These people didn't put this together overnight.
[02:00:27.083 --> 02:00:31.827]  But, people need to get out there in the streets, you know, and be out there and get active.
[02:00:32.087 --> 02:00:32.888]  Be aggressive!
[02:00:32.948 --> 02:00:37.692]  I mean, just everybody do something, and together we... I mean, together it's unstoppable.
[02:00:38.133 --> 02:00:40.795]  Be a leader, because we have to all be leaders in this.
[02:00:40.815 --> 02:00:42.116]  This is not about one leader.
[02:00:42.136 --> 02:00:43.978]  It's not about any one man doing it.
[02:00:43.998 --> 02:00:46.360]  This is a cohesive, massive effort.
[02:00:46.921 --> 02:00:50.504]  And if... Here's the way I see it with the prominent people coming out, Alex.
[02:00:51.024 --> 02:00:51.805]  I see it like this.
[02:00:52.877 --> 02:01:09.670]  Christina Ebersole, you know, was encouraged to do what she's done because she's running into things like John Connor and she's a fan of your show and she's hearing different things, but in my opinion, Alex, I think that, and I'm sure a lot of people understand this, that we are the ones that have to shine right now.
[02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:16.375]  The prominent people, they have to face smearing and all these things that the mainstream media does to them and it's very hard for them to do this.
[02:01:16.615 --> 02:01:20.378]  They could be sitting in their home right now listening to this and they know what's going on.
[02:01:20.819 --> 02:01:22.961]  But they're not going to come out because they fear for all those things.
[02:01:23.481 --> 02:01:36.211]  But if they see, on every corner, somebody out there with a bullhorn, somebody passing out DVDs, somebody doing things like what John Connor, what you, and what all these other warriors are doing, then that's going to only encourage them.
[02:01:36.231 --> 02:01:41.615]  They're going to come out, you know, they're going to trickle out faster because they're going to say, hmm, look at all these people out there.
[02:01:41.815 --> 02:01:42.616]  Oh, they're not going to look.
[02:01:42.696 --> 02:01:43.156]  Exactly.
[02:01:43.196 --> 02:01:44.317]  The dam's already broken.
[02:01:44.357 --> 02:01:46.058]  And that's just already wide open.
[02:01:46.258 --> 02:01:47.499]  You know, it's wide open.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:49.581]  And in closing, I don't want to take up too much time.
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:58.350]  Can you, uh, I tell family members all the time about the vaccinations and I'm worried about people having little newborns and things in my family and friends.
[02:01:59.291 --> 02:02:00.352]  What do you recommend?
[02:02:00.392 --> 02:02:03.075]  I tell people, hey, I don't recommend any of these vaccinations.
[02:02:03.375 --> 02:02:08.621]  My children have had zero vaccines inoculations.
[02:02:09.022 --> 02:02:10.684]  Zero, zero, zero.
[02:02:11.263 --> 02:02:15.106]  That's what I believe in, and I've had others argue with me and say, hey, that can't be true.
[02:02:15.126 --> 02:02:17.628]  Well, then the other side says, you'll get our kids sick.
[02:02:17.688 --> 02:02:24.034]  No, you go take your deadly poison and then you're supposedly covered now from it.
[02:02:24.314 --> 02:02:31.000]  In fact, the problem is they take their deadly vaccine and then they get, quote, herd immunity and sheep out all the weird stuff.
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:34.843]  But we've got a medical doctor coming on right now to talk about that, Dr. William Deagle.
[02:02:35.403 --> 02:02:37.385]  Joining us on the other side, thank you for the call.
[02:02:37.485 --> 02:02:38.466]  Great call, Danny.
[02:02:38.966 --> 02:02:41.968]  Ryan, Paula, others, we'll get to you, but first, Dr. Ziegle.
[02:02:41.988 --> 02:02:50.494]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:02:50.835 --> 02:02:52.776]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:02:53.156 --> 02:03:00.722]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:01.471 --> 02:03:08.537]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:03:08.937 --> 02:03:20.366]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.667 --> 02:03:24.149]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:03:24.610 --> 02:03:26.551]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:03:26.892 --> 02:03:30.735]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:03:44.382 --> 02:03:47.925]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:03:47.985 --> 02:03:48.485]  are located?
[02:03:48.705 --> 02:03:52.088]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:03:52.308 --> 02:03:57.031]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:03:57.291 --> 02:04:02.295]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[02:04:02.555 --> 02:04:03.136]  We're good to go.
[02:04:21.254 --> 02:04:21.894]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.805 --> 02:04:49.927]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:04:50.167 --> 02:04:51.928]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:04:52.188 --> 02:04:58.472]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:04:58.772 --> 02:05:04.895]  Using this similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.135 --> 02:05:06.996]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:05:07.236 --> 02:05:07.536]  I think?
[02:05:23.692 --> 02:05:25.553]  Using pictures are easy to follow.
[02:05:25.733 --> 02:05:28.275]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:05:28.395 --> 02:05:29.496]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:29.756 --> 02:05:30.777]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:30.937 --> 02:05:33.298]  For more information, call BioSolutions toll-free 1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:33.319 --> 02:05:33.879]  That's 1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:33.899 --> 02:05:33.959]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:05:33.999 --> 02:05:37.061]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:37.121 --> 02:05:38.342]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.882]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:05:56.942 --> 02:05:57.842]  until 2 p.m.
[02:05:58.322 --> 02:06:05.667]  We're here live, retransmitted over the network satellites and internet system from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time, then from 1 a.m.
[02:06:06.147 --> 02:06:06.948]  to 4 a.m.
[02:06:06.988 --> 02:06:09.750]  Central Time, nine hours a day on Genesis.
[02:06:10.570 --> 02:06:15.193]  And then I restream my show 24 hours a day at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:15.633 --> 02:06:21.897]  The three hours played consecutively and you can also subscribe for free at InfoWars.com.
[02:06:23.524 --> 02:06:26.687]  Tens upon tens of thousands of people every month now subscribing.
[02:06:26.747 --> 02:06:30.750]  It's just building up to quite a mass of people to the free podcast.
[02:06:30.770 --> 02:06:37.595]  You just go to Infowars.com, click subscribe, and it automatically downloads into your iPod or MP3 player.
[02:06:37.775 --> 02:06:38.856]  Very easy to do.
[02:06:38.876 --> 02:06:41.358]  You can also link through at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:06:42.356 --> 02:06:49.380]  Another way to reach people is with these little quarter watt or whatever they are, less than a quarter watt FM transmitters.
[02:06:49.420 --> 02:06:54.442]  Now you can hook up another antenna to these and triple their broadcast power up to 300, 400 feet.
[02:06:55.182 --> 02:06:59.344]  But outside they go about 100 feet, inside 40 to 70 feet.
[02:06:59.705 --> 02:07:01.125]  They'll go through a few walls.
[02:07:01.485 --> 02:07:05.527]  So you can be in your apartment complex, pick a frequency on the FM that doesn't have anything on it.
[02:07:05.828 --> 02:07:10.690]  It'll override other stuff, but just not as far if it's on a frequency that already has a station.
[02:07:11.668 --> 02:07:36.554]  And you just broadcast on this, and it will go a couple floors above you, and a couple below you, and a couple of apartment rooms over from you, or it'll broadcast into a large office, and you could just, it's a small little water-resistant unit, little black unit, you just dial in the frequency you want it on, and you plug in the little four-volt adapter, you get a six-volt adapter at Radio Shack for five bucks,
[02:07:37.254 --> 02:07:38.515]  That doubles the power.
[02:07:38.575 --> 02:07:42.296]  Little secrets, but again, we can't sell these units with that.
[02:07:43.296 --> 02:07:46.698]  With a 6-volt adapter, it doubles the power.
[02:07:46.738 --> 02:07:53.660]  Then you can hook a little FM extender, you know, coiled antenna that you loop out, and then that can double it.
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:57.802]  So I guess you could have a quadrupling there, conservatively, going out 400, 500 feet.
[02:07:57.962 --> 02:08:02.723]  You have to tinker with it though, but by itself, you know, 40 to 100 feet, depending
[02:08:04.873 --> 02:08:05.754]  Great new system.
[02:08:05.834 --> 02:08:10.578]  It's available for $69 at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:11.118 --> 02:08:21.966]  Right now we have it in black, white, and gray, and discover the freedom of sending a wireless broadcast of any audio music, audio streaming, audio mp3, audio, etc.
[02:08:21.986 --> 02:08:24.708]  to any FM radio anywhere in your home office.
[02:08:26.530 --> 02:08:30.553]  And all you got to do is just plug it into the audio jack and it broadcasts.
[02:08:31.113 --> 02:08:31.614]  You could just
[02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:42.421]  Stream Genesis 24 hours a day or stream InfoWars 24 hours a day or stream music 24 hours a day and have your own radio station and not be tied to your computer.
[02:08:43.302 --> 02:08:46.463]  So again, that's available at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:46.503 --> 02:08:47.503]  Something new we've added.
[02:08:47.863 --> 02:08:52.865]  We've also added BlackInfoWars.com ball caps.
[02:08:52.945 --> 02:08:53.785]  Really nice hats.
[02:08:53.805 --> 02:08:55.946]  We looked at a bunch of different hats before we chose this one.
[02:08:56.566 --> 02:08:56.986]  It says
[02:08:58.132 --> 02:09:09.756]  InfoWars.com on the front above the bill and on the back on the loop, you know, where you adjust the hat size, it says 9-11 equals inside job.
[02:09:10.476 --> 02:09:12.297]  Great way to meet like-minded people.
[02:09:12.397 --> 02:09:18.459]  Great way to tell the truth and broadcast the truth when you just walk around at the shopping mall or on the street or at the gym.
[02:09:18.999 --> 02:09:21.860]  Those new ball caps available at InfoWars.com.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:23.060]  Folks kept asking for them.
[02:09:23.381 --> 02:09:23.981]  You've got them.
[02:09:24.121 --> 02:09:24.521]  All right!
[02:09:25.814 --> 02:09:27.775]  Going to Dr. William Deagle.
[02:09:28.576 --> 02:09:30.137]  He's been on Genesis in the past.
[02:09:30.217 --> 02:09:34.720]  Now he's rejoined the Genesis team and he's on weekdays 2 to 4 p.m.
[02:09:34.820 --> 02:09:37.902]  Central Standard Time here with us.
[02:09:37.922 --> 02:09:39.322]  He's a medical doctor.
[02:09:39.342 --> 02:09:42.264]  He's worked in the military, worked in private practice, worked in the U.S.
[02:09:42.304 --> 02:09:44.726]  He now resides in Canada with a practice
[02:09:45.446 --> 02:09:46.087]  Yes, we are.
[02:10:02.165 --> 02:10:10.008]  Human papilloma virus causing bleed-outs, Crohn's-type diseases, autoimmune responses.
[02:10:10.048 --> 02:10:13.649]  The pediatricians and others are saying yes, the vaccines are doing this.
[02:10:14.329 --> 02:10:16.050]  Dr. Diegel, thank you for joining us.
[02:10:16.670 --> 02:10:20.712]  Thanks Alex, and I hope everybody will check out the reference articles.
[02:10:20.852 --> 02:10:23.713]  I've actually posted it up on Nutramedical in the news section.
[02:10:24.711 --> 02:10:41.336]  And I want to hit the high points because there's a lot of information that the news media and the medical profession are talking about, including I posted up on this article that I posted on Nutramedical, the statement by Jan Orient, who belongs to the American Association of American Physicians and Surgeons.
[02:10:41.936 --> 02:10:48.679]  Her statement on February 11th in Irvine, Texas, basically the top of the article is, hands off our kids.
[02:10:50.934 --> 02:11:04.577]  Then I've also posted a Dr. Hauerstein references to a dozen or so major websites on why vaccines are dangerous, but I want to kind of focus on a few points because I want people to take a couple of things away from this and then we can expand on it.
[02:11:05.197 --> 02:11:10.198]  The first thing is it puts a live virus into 8 to 12 year old girls.
[02:11:10.918 --> 02:11:17.359]  This is not a dead virus and people, including doctors, you see most doctors are not trained in basic science.
[02:11:17.399 --> 02:11:20.000]  I did bacteriology research before I went into medicine.
[02:11:20.931 --> 02:11:23.614]  And they don't understand there's no such thing as attenuation.
[02:11:24.715 --> 02:11:33.865]  When you put a virus in someone, depending on their body's immune status and their selenium and other levels in their body, that virus can activate, mutate, recombine with anything else in the body.
[02:11:34.745 --> 02:11:38.809]  So number one, when you're putting a live cancer virus, you're putting a cancer virus in.
[02:11:38.929 --> 02:11:41.931]  And lo and behold, we're seeing massive autoimmune reactions.
[02:11:42.191 --> 02:11:42.452]  Right.
[02:11:42.592 --> 02:11:55.843]  And number two, you're increasing the risk of disease in patients already affected, because you now have someone who could be infected, and now you're putting a tremendous immune challenge by putting this, and it's loaded with what's called adjuvants, and they are all
[02:11:56.463 --> 02:12:01.149]  A-L-L, triple, high, 19 foot letter, all toxins.
[02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:04.494]  So that can domino effect and trigger other health problems.
[02:12:04.814 --> 02:12:05.395]  Absolutely.
[02:12:05.415 --> 02:12:12.084]  They can cause an immune collapse because the cytokines in there, which are these inflammatory molecules, can make them have a cardiorespiratory collapse.
[02:12:13.806 --> 02:12:31.506]  Well, even the Food and Drug Administration, as you know, and this was in the Washington Times and AP two weeks ago, reported adverse reactions of autoimmune responses, rashes, bleeding, convulsions, seizures, collapse.
[02:12:31.846 --> 02:12:42.055]  Yeah, in fact, it's probably, as far as I know, just going back to the literature over the last week or so, just reviewing all the literature on this, it seems to be the highest rate I've ever seen for a vaccine.
[02:12:42.096 --> 02:12:46.920]  And I've been in practice now about 30 years, and I've never seen one quite like this.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:57.510]  I've been through, you know, meningitis epidemics where I got the vaccine, I've researched all these things, and I've seen in my own kids, and I stopped many years ago giving vaccines because I saw the effects in my own patients.
[02:12:58.270 --> 02:13:05.234]  It has mercury, aluminum, preservatives, toxins, and these new vaccines they have coming out also have unstable DNA.
[02:13:05.254 --> 02:13:18.942]  Now people have to realize this, when you have the DNA in a vaccine, whether it's from fetal retinal cells or larval insect DNA, this DNA is unstable, it's not bound, and it can get in your cells and be carried into your cells of your gut, and so the pair
[02:13:19.002 --> 02:13:28.390]  And am I correct in saying that another big problem is there's always pre-existing viruses in any live tissue culture and they don't even do scans for those.
[02:13:28.410 --> 02:13:28.970]  No, no they don't.
[02:13:28.991 --> 02:13:31.613]  And those can mutate and recombine.
[02:13:31.913 --> 02:13:33.214]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:13:34.555 --> 02:13:36.717]  And you're right on, Alex, because you always do your research.
[02:13:37.257 --> 02:13:42.160]  This virus, often these vaccines are a witch's brew of other viruses.
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:48.665]  For example, as long ago as 1954, they found that the Salk vaccine contained monkey viruses or cancer viruses.
[02:13:49.325 --> 02:13:54.449]  We know that the SV40, simian virus 40, has been in the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and still is.
[02:13:55.203 --> 02:13:57.044]  And it's contaminating and has contaminated.
[02:13:57.064 --> 02:13:59.786]  It's an oncogenic virus that might not even turn into cancer.
[02:14:00.046 --> 02:14:00.966]  Here's a brief story.
[02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:09.271]  About two years ago, I met the pediatrician and he says, don't say my name, but it's true.
[02:14:09.291 --> 02:14:11.392]  You know, doctors every year volunteer.
[02:14:11.412 --> 02:14:12.072]  You're supposed to.
[02:14:12.452 --> 02:14:13.553]  He was down at a city clinic.
[02:14:13.573 --> 02:14:15.434]  He said they were giving the inner city kids
[02:14:16.204 --> 02:14:24.770]  Twenty-plus year old illegal oral polio vaccine that's banned in this country because all of it has SV40 in it.
[02:14:25.050 --> 02:14:26.951]  And he said, I can't believe it, you were right!
[02:14:27.492 --> 02:14:28.012]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:28.312 --> 02:14:34.877]  Yeah, it's a form of molecular genocide and it's actually a vaccine-mediated genocide and of course they've shielded
[02:14:35.458 --> 02:14:45.887]  The President, and what you'll find at direct links, for example, in the state of Colorado, Dr. Ned Collage, who's not only the President of the Board of Medical Examiners, but also is the head of the state vaccine program.
[02:14:46.367 --> 02:14:58.878]  And if you don't order your little vaccines on your patients, what they're trying to do now is get the states of each state to report the doctor and say it's substandard care if he won't force his patients one way or the other to take these deadly vaccines.
[02:14:59.338 --> 02:15:03.060]  They want to give as many as 27 vaccines to newborns.
[02:15:03.480 --> 02:15:05.101]  Right now, and it's an obscenity.
[02:15:05.141 --> 02:15:06.722]  They're going in and trying to grab kids.
[02:15:06.742 --> 02:15:07.943]  You have it on your show all the time.
[02:15:08.443 --> 02:15:11.945]  But there's even more serious things, and this is one of the things that people need to realize.
[02:15:11.985 --> 02:15:12.866]  When you have a weak host,
[02:15:13.800 --> 02:15:24.568]  And you inject them with a vaccine, like these vaccines, the average time, this is from Dr. Russell Blaylock and other experts, it upregulates some pathways in the brain, called peroxynitrate pathways.
[02:15:25.069 --> 02:15:31.854]  And it makes their brain inflamed and their nervous system for two years after just one set of these toxic vaccines.
[02:15:32.134 --> 02:15:39.900]  And when they hit them with multiple vaccines, they break down the blood-brain barrier, so these viruses not only migrate to the other areas, but they get into their central nervous system.
[02:15:40.549 --> 02:15:40.970]  We know that.
[02:15:41.370 --> 02:15:50.183]  It causes chronic fatigue and it also... Now it's now coming out that this shot is causing Crohn's-like bleeding and autoimmune responses in the upper and lower intestine.
[02:15:50.563 --> 02:15:50.784]  Right.
[02:15:50.844 --> 02:15:56.011]  So what it does is it cross-reacts with other pathogens we call stealth pathogens that are in everybody.
[02:15:56.972 --> 02:15:58.153]  There's a cause of disease.
[02:15:58.193 --> 02:16:05.139]  We know that Saccharomyces cerevisiae is tied in with Crohn's disease, so there's probably some degree of what we call adjuvant reactions.
[02:16:05.199 --> 02:16:21.754]  In other words, you have these heavy metals, all these toxins, all these other adjuvants to amplify the effect of the virus DNA, and now all of a sudden the body's going crazy attacking body proteins in the lamina propria of your small bowel, attacking the brain, the nervous system, inflaming your brain, your meninges,
[02:16:22.394 --> 02:16:23.414]  It's just obscene.
[02:16:23.575 --> 02:16:27.116]  And the thing is, if people like me speak up, guess what happens?
[02:16:27.216 --> 02:16:29.036]  The State Board yanks their license.
[02:16:29.096 --> 02:16:30.497]  They put them through living hell.
[02:16:30.997 --> 02:16:33.838]  Because they don't want to have doctors like me saying the truth.
[02:16:34.278 --> 02:16:35.138]  And I'm a scientist.
[02:16:35.178 --> 02:16:36.139]  I've been doing this for years.
[02:16:36.199 --> 02:16:37.199]  I can show the references.
[02:16:37.239 --> 02:16:38.840]  I've got tons of information here.
[02:16:39.280 --> 02:16:40.300]  I posted on this link.
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:42.641]  And it is beyond obscenity.
[02:16:43.161 --> 02:16:46.682]  What they have as a plan in Operation BioShield, 275 plus vaccines,
[02:16:49.142 --> 02:16:50.224]  They're in three categories.
[02:16:50.384 --> 02:16:52.407]  Number one, the old style of disease vaccines.
[02:16:53.208 --> 02:16:55.011]  Then they have the quote, the cancer vaccines.
[02:16:55.031 --> 02:16:56.853]  And this isn't a cancer vaccine, by the way.
[02:16:57.334 --> 02:17:02.522]  This vaccine is a vaccine supposedly against human papillomavirus, only four strains.
[02:17:03.197 --> 02:17:09.640]  But they had third categories, what's called psychotronic immunological vaccines that actually form plaque in different areas of the brain.
[02:17:09.700 --> 02:17:12.502]  Now that's the one that was in the BBC and London Times last year.
[02:17:12.522 --> 02:17:17.905]  They're trying to make every school-aged child take a live virus that attacks brain tissue.
[02:17:17.945 --> 02:17:19.205]  Folks, mainstream news.
[02:17:19.685 --> 02:17:22.027]  Dr. Deagle, let's talk about the three groups when we get back.
[02:17:23.107 --> 02:17:27.529]  By the way, Merck's claiming they're withdrawing the promotion and lobbying for the vaccine.
[02:17:27.569 --> 02:17:28.650]  I don't believe that for a minute.
[02:17:29.510 --> 02:17:30.371]  But this is a victory.
[02:17:30.999 --> 02:17:33.821]  They're trying to give us a fake victory so we'll go to sleep.
[02:17:33.841 --> 02:17:37.364]  We have to intensify the exposure of this.
[02:17:37.705 --> 02:17:41.808]  We'll do it with Dr. William Deagle on the other side, another great Genesis host.
[02:17:45.962 --> 02:17:47.003]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:17:47.323 --> 02:17:50.125]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:50.385 --> 02:17:54.528]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:54.969 --> 02:17:55.789]  So what do you do?
[02:17:56.109 --> 02:18:00.673]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:01.173 --> 02:18:03.295]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:18:44.491 --> 02:18:45.592]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[02:18:45.652 --> 02:18:46.033]  February 12, 2007.
[02:18:46.093 --> 02:18:46.373]  Gold 6.57.
[02:18:46.553 --> 02:18:48.434]  90 ounce gold coins are at 6.79.18, 3.40.215 for half, 1.71.08 for quarter ounce.
[02:18:48.474 --> 02:18:48.795]  That's 6.79.18, 3.40.215, and 1.71.08.
[02:18:48.875 --> 02:18:56.140]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11,110 was signed with the authority to strip the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government and interest.
[02:19:12.432 --> 02:19:15.713]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[02:19:15.793 --> 02:19:19.234]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[02:19:19.314 --> 02:19:22.335]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[02:19:22.595 --> 02:19:25.496]  Midas has the Kennedy vs. Fed document.
[02:19:25.556 --> 02:19:26.017]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:26.097 --> 02:19:30.898]  Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[02:19:31.058 --> 02:19:31.779]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:31.939 --> 02:19:38.021]  If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:38.041 --> 02:19:38.221]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:44.963 --> 02:19:47.445]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.205 --> 02:19:50.866]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:51.587 --> 02:20:07.695]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[02:20:08.692 --> 02:20:13.913]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:20:14.733 --> 02:20:22.655]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:23.675 --> 02:20:24.195]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:24.495]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:35.419 --> 02:20:36.440]  The call is free.
[02:20:36.660 --> 02:20:42.083]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year's subscription to News Watch Magazine.
[02:20:44.264 --> 02:20:49.207]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:20:49.528 --> 02:20:51.409]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:20:51.609 --> 02:20:54.651]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:20:54.831 --> 02:20:57.973]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:20:58.273 --> 02:21:00.094]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[02:21:00.374 --> 02:21:00.735]  We're good to go.
[02:21:16.838 --> 02:21:21.160]  The Bible says, we'd like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[02:21:21.480 --> 02:21:25.722]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[02:21:26.062 --> 02:21:31.945]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy, tyrants and wars, the new world order, and much more.
[02:21:32.245 --> 02:21:34.666]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:21:34.886 --> 02:21:35.366]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:21:35.386 --> 02:21:36.487]  That's 1-888-211-1715, and ask for Packet B.
[02:21:58.681 --> 02:21:59.242]  Welcome back!
[02:22:19.003 --> 02:22:22.384]  By the way, it's going up in five minutes on JonesReport.com.
[02:22:22.964 --> 02:22:36.647]  I asked Aaron Russo for a photo of him with Nick Rockefeller, who he was friends with for years, who said they openly wanted to forcibly reduce world population, who said that there was going to be a big attack in the next year, that they'd be going into Afghanistan.
[02:22:38.207 --> 02:22:39.127]  We have the photo.
[02:22:39.227 --> 02:22:39.768]  It's going up.
[02:22:39.848 --> 02:22:41.028]  You want it, you got it.
[02:22:41.108 --> 02:22:41.648]  There it is.
[02:22:42.883 --> 02:22:44.664]  Let's go back to Dr. William Deagle.
[02:22:45.044 --> 02:22:49.386]  Yeah, that third type of vaccine, a couple years ago, I saw all over the British press how great it was.
[02:22:49.406 --> 02:22:54.147]  No more opiate addiction, no more narcotic addiction, no more nicotine addiction.
[02:22:54.768 --> 02:23:09.533]  You just take this vaccine and then I read deeper and it said it's a wonderful new development and the whole new science of vaccines is shifting into live viruses and the virus goes in and it said destroys the receptors that would pick this up.
[02:23:09.553 --> 02:23:10.854]  Well, those are the same receptors
[02:23:11.694 --> 02:23:14.858]  That the drugs mimic that pick up the natural endorphins.
[02:23:14.918 --> 02:23:16.680]  Like, I got a rush yesterday.
[02:23:16.720 --> 02:23:20.204]  We were up here exposing and warning people not to take this vaccine.
[02:23:20.224 --> 02:23:21.205]  I like saving people.
[02:23:21.305 --> 02:23:22.086]  I get off on it.
[02:23:22.246 --> 02:23:23.768]  It's my... I'm a good guy.
[02:23:24.703 --> 02:23:36.433]  I get a big thrill here when I hear that their CFO at Merck is resigning, when I hear that they're cancelling their lobbying, trying to force the states to force people to take it.
[02:23:36.893 --> 02:23:39.155]  I get excited when the British are pulling out of Iraq.
[02:23:39.195 --> 02:23:39.815]  I get excited.
[02:23:40.236 --> 02:23:41.236]  I mean, that's natural.
[02:23:41.577 --> 02:23:44.259]  Dr. Deagle, explain what that third type does.
[02:23:45.023 --> 02:23:52.931]  The third vaccine is what it does is the virus literally attaches to brain proteins and there's 29 main brain proteins.
[02:23:52.971 --> 02:23:58.796]  I work with an immunology lab where we've done research for years with Dr. Aristo Vajdani in Beverly Hills, California.
[02:23:59.357 --> 02:24:07.365]  And when you add heavy metals, when you add viruses, they attach to those proteins or those receptors and then they make the body's immune system say this is not self.
[02:24:07.925 --> 02:24:16.211]  So the T-killer cells, the immune cells, the plasma cells migrate in there and they generate inflammatory molecules, they create plaque, and they literally destroy those structures.
[02:24:16.691 --> 02:24:18.712]  So they literally turn you into a cyborg.
[02:24:19.173 --> 02:24:21.674]  They turn you into a machine from a human being.
[02:24:22.195 --> 02:24:23.496]  And that's what their intent is.
[02:24:23.536 --> 02:24:25.997]  Their intent is to turn us into machines.
[02:24:26.057 --> 02:24:28.539]  Now, they need to connect the dots a little further.
[02:24:28.939 --> 02:24:29.860]  Why would they do this?
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:31.781]  And why would doctors not speak up?
[02:24:31.801 --> 02:24:37.445]  They don't speak up because they're afraid, because they're being treated as administrative citizens instead of sovereign citizens.
[02:24:38.085 --> 02:24:41.568]  And they're terrifying doctors through all these processes.
[02:24:41.608 --> 02:24:45.651]  Now insurance carriers are reporting doctors that won't even report their patients.
[02:24:45.671 --> 02:24:52.236]  So they're making us all, if you want to call it, a medical spitz nuts army, literally reporting our own people.
[02:24:52.676 --> 02:24:54.938]  These vaccines are being tested this year.
[02:24:55.318 --> 02:24:59.901]  I've been told in DPS Children in Britain and CPS in America in the Northeast.
[02:25:00.182 --> 02:25:03.144]  I don't have all the details of exactly where, but I do have sources.
[02:25:03.784 --> 02:25:06.886]  And the vaccines are being used, of course, on child protection kids.
[02:25:07.166 --> 02:25:11.628]  The most dangerous place to be if your child is under child protection in America... Now, let's be clear.
[02:25:11.728 --> 02:25:12.708]  This isn't Dr. Deagle.
[02:25:12.728 --> 02:25:19.872]  This is the London Independent, the London Times, the BBC, telling you how wonderful... This is about two years ago now.
[02:25:19.932 --> 02:25:22.533]  They said, oh, we're going to make it the law.
[02:25:23.579 --> 02:25:26.681]  That every child has to take this, so they'll never be addicted to drugs.
[02:25:27.202 --> 02:25:36.789]  And then scientists went, oh yes, it's a live virus that creates plaques in the brain to block the chemical reaction that these drugs cause.
[02:25:37.910 --> 02:25:44.015]  Folks, you're literally talking about destroying brain tissue, targeted lobotomies.
[02:25:44.992 --> 02:25:46.553]  I mean, this is off the charts!
[02:25:46.613 --> 02:25:54.757]  This is just... I mean, I can't... This is Twilight Zone, Body Snatcher, Outer Limits, weird, in your face, and it's just calmly announced.
[02:25:55.037 --> 02:25:56.778]  Live viruses that eat your brain.
[02:25:57.078 --> 02:25:57.919]  Oh, it's so good!
[02:25:57.939 --> 02:26:13.227]  Yeah, this is literally out of the pit of hell, and the problem is that people don't believe it because they think it's so otherworldly, and it's not spoken of, and most people don't realize that most doctors don't have the science background that people like Dr. Russell Blaylock or myself
[02:26:14.087 --> 02:26:14.988]  We're good to go.
[02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:34.401]  from these vaccines.
[02:26:34.781 --> 02:26:42.446]  They're going to be required, when they tried three years ago to force all the doctors in America to take the vaccine against the smallpox, guess what?
[02:26:42.546 --> 02:26:45.449]  The doctors went back to the literature and everybody says, we're not doing it.
[02:26:45.809 --> 02:26:49.872]  But six doctors in Massachusetts ponied up and said, yeah, give me a shot.
[02:26:50.512 --> 02:26:52.754]  Two or three of them dropped dead from sudden heart attacks.
[02:26:52.794 --> 02:26:57.437]  They found if males had silent vascular disease within the next 48 to 72 hours, they were
[02:26:59.708 --> 02:26:59.968]  Dead.
[02:27:00.429 --> 02:27:00.769]  And why?
[02:27:00.789 --> 02:27:04.172]  Because it created an autoimmune inflammation in the arteries, correct?
[02:27:04.412 --> 02:27:04.732]  Right.
[02:27:04.752 --> 02:27:05.393]  And exactly.
[02:27:05.413 --> 02:27:07.915]  And that's where a proxynitrate reaction produced unstable plaque.
[02:27:07.935 --> 02:27:10.957]  Who was the famous NBC reporter who dropped dead five hours?
[02:27:10.997 --> 02:27:12.078]  He was like 40 years old.
[02:27:12.118 --> 02:27:13.319]  He took the shot in Baghdad.
[02:27:13.359 --> 02:27:13.700]  Boom.
[02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:14.040]  Gone.
[02:27:14.320 --> 02:27:14.761]  That's right.
[02:27:14.781 --> 02:27:16.602]  I don't remember his name, but I heard the same story.
[02:27:16.622 --> 02:27:17.643]  And they said, yeah, the vaccine killed him.
[02:27:17.663 --> 02:27:18.303]  And guess what we say?
[02:27:18.324 --> 02:27:20.565]  You know what I said to the state health department in Colorado?
[02:27:20.625 --> 02:27:24.248]  I said, you might as well come on down and get the cough syrup, because I'm not taking it.
[02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:26.510]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:26.791 --> 02:27:27.711]  Let's talk about
[02:27:29.591 --> 02:27:32.653]  How we stop these people, and let's talk about the eugenics program.
[02:27:34.714 --> 02:27:35.654]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.115 --> 02:27:37.736]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.636 --> 02:27:41.418]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:46.721]  Government is best, which governs least.
[02:27:46.801 --> 02:27:48.041]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:27:48.282 --> 02:27:51.103]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:27:51.463 --> 02:27:54.185]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:27:54.762 --> 02:28:01.488]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:28:31.256 --> 02:28:33.678]  Shelly, you look ex... Oh wait, why did you turn that down?
[02:28:47.298 --> 02:28:49.499]  I get so tired of that girl's squeaky voice.
[02:28:49.959 --> 02:28:54.401]  I'm sure the bed fan works, but that squeaky voice... Well, what's the bed fan?
[02:28:54.581 --> 02:28:56.982]  It's a fan that helps hot sleepers stay cool at night.
[02:28:57.242 --> 02:28:58.423]  I can do something like that.
[02:28:58.443 --> 02:29:00.824]  This menopause thing is really getting to me at night.
[02:29:00.964 --> 02:29:03.825]  And you know how I am about doing that hormone therapy thing.
[02:29:03.865 --> 02:29:05.666]  Besides, you're a hot sleeper yourself.
[02:29:05.766 --> 02:29:08.007]  You're always throwing the covers off in the middle of the night.
[02:29:08.367 --> 02:29:09.008]  I guess you're right.
[02:29:09.368 --> 02:29:10.048]  Why don't we try it?
[02:29:10.208 --> 02:29:12.149]  Just think how nice it'll be to sleep through the night.
[02:29:12.583 --> 02:29:16.946]  Yeah, and just think how nice it'll be this summer and all the money we can save on air conditioning.
[02:29:17.226 --> 02:29:18.587]  I know where we can get some more information.
[02:29:19.007 --> 02:29:23.270]  Sleep Disorder Centers across the country recommend that you must stay cool to get a good night's sleep.
[02:29:23.510 --> 02:29:26.753]  The BedFan will keep you cool and give you the restful sleep you deserve.

[02:30:32.728 --> 02:30:34.829]  For the last three months, myself, Rob Jacobson,
[02:31:01.789 --> 02:31:03.430]  It's a project for New American Citizen.
[02:31:03.971 --> 02:31:06.573]  Young men from UT have been going down to the libraries.
[02:31:07.534 --> 02:31:09.475]  UT, City of Austin Central.
[02:31:10.496 --> 02:31:13.459]  When you actually in your hand have the New York Times.
[02:31:15.043 --> 02:31:37.864]  When you have books published by the Rockefellers from the 20s, the 30s, the 40s, the 50s, the 60s, the 70s, where they say they've got to reduce world population, and where all they do in their, quote, spare time is sit on the boards of eugenics bodies to reduce population, and you find out that they went in and bought up all the major cancer research facilities in 1910, 1920, 1930,
[02:31:40.766 --> 02:31:45.188]  That they pioneered modern vaccines and the makers and really own most of the companies.
[02:31:45.688 --> 02:31:52.191]  And you find out the tens of thousands that died when they tried this vaccine or the hundreds of thousands that got sick when they did that vaccine.
[02:31:52.811 --> 02:31:56.273]  And you find out that's why they've got total immunity federally.
[02:31:56.653 --> 02:31:59.274]  That's why they're able to... This is a eugenics program.
[02:32:00.575 --> 02:32:01.556]  We've caught the U.N.
[02:32:01.576 --> 02:32:04.678]  sterilizing women all over the world in the mid-90s.
[02:32:04.758 --> 02:32:05.799]  It was in mainstream news.
[02:32:05.839 --> 02:32:11.442]  They were caught adding a female hormone, binding it to the tetanus pathogen, that then sterilized the women.
[02:32:12.483 --> 02:32:12.823]  Okay?
[02:32:13.864 --> 02:32:17.867]  Again, I'm not saying there couldn't be some good vaccine properly made that might help.
[02:32:17.887 --> 02:32:20.428]  I'm going to ask Dr. Deagle as a medical doctor what he thinks of that.
[02:32:20.688 --> 02:32:24.191]  The point is, if someone... I'm sure milk's good.
[02:32:24.211 --> 02:32:24.711]  I like milk.
[02:32:25.091 --> 02:32:25.952]  Cold, frosty milk.
[02:32:27.523 --> 02:32:37.412]  But if some particular company, twenty times, had put cyanide in milk and killed people, whether it was an accident or on purpose, would you ever drink from that company?
[02:32:37.452 --> 02:32:37.632]  No.
[02:32:38.053 --> 02:32:39.334]  One time they'd be out of business.
[02:32:40.075 --> 02:32:42.317]  This is thousands of times with these companies.
[02:32:42.357 --> 02:32:43.838]  I mean, Bayer knowingly?
[02:32:43.878 --> 02:32:45.219]  They just got convicted in court?
[02:32:45.379 --> 02:32:46.541]  Their own documents came out?
[02:32:47.461 --> 02:32:48.743]  And of course it was by design.
[02:32:48.783 --> 02:32:51.165]  They knew they were buying blood that had HIV and hepatitis.
[02:32:51.920 --> 02:32:54.202]  They said, just to make more money, they didn't care.
[02:32:54.222 --> 02:32:54.663]  No, no, no.
[02:32:54.703 --> 02:32:56.144]  It's part of a larger program.
[02:32:56.584 --> 02:32:59.207]  That's how you don't have a conscience, is you believe it's good.
[02:32:59.627 --> 02:33:01.048]  This is totally psychopathic.
[02:33:01.849 --> 02:33:15.101]  And Bayer got, they were doing it in America, Canada, England, New Zealand, but they got caught in Australia, Bayer Pharmaceutical, knowing that millions of lots of this blood product, Factor VIII, were filled with HIV every
[02:33:16.642 --> 02:33:19.847]  Dosage, and every person that took it got AIDS.
[02:33:20.568 --> 02:33:23.092]  Tens of thousands died alone in Canada.
[02:33:23.432 --> 02:33:24.834]  Tens of thousands in the US.
[02:33:25.155 --> 02:33:26.918]  Thousands and thousands all over Europe.
[02:33:26.938 --> 02:33:28.219]  They also went to France.
[02:33:28.941 --> 02:33:30.403]  People went to jail, by the way, in France.
[02:33:31.627 --> 02:33:44.151]  Dr. Deagle, people need to get their minds around this and understand I have the mainstream news articles where John D. Rockefeller funded Hitler, where he funded the Nazi party from the time it was set up in the early twenties.
[02:33:44.691 --> 02:33:46.572]  I actually have them now!
[02:33:46.912 --> 02:33:47.612]  Dr. Deagle?
[02:33:48.152 --> 02:33:51.835]  Yes, you're 1000% correct.
[02:33:52.335 --> 02:34:14.890]  I spoke March 16, 1997 in Zurich, Switzerland to the Human Life International and after my two-hour talk against human fetal tissue transplantation for diabetes in China and Colorado and elsewhere around the world and for Parkinson's disease and cyborg research which they tried to induct me to do at UCLA in 1978 at the VA Wadsworth Hospital.
[02:34:18.943 --> 02:34:19.403]  Guess what?
[02:34:19.764 --> 02:34:32.220]  They had sat me down for another two hours and gave me a huge mountain of documents right from the World Health Organization and their eugenics program including, number one, they had the actual details in 1997 of
[02:34:33.822 --> 02:34:55.289]  They had taken Sub-Saharan African women, just as you said, they gave them a vaccine for tetanus and they went back every month and revaccinated them and measured, drew bloods to measure antibodies against human chorionic and atropine so they couldn't carry a pregnancy and in their documents which they gave me, they said there were 185 million excess Sub-Saharan Africans.
[02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:59.651]  They also gave me documents on the AIDS virus as a retrovirus.
[02:35:00.251 --> 02:35:09.494]  And interestingly, I was asked to go back and take a year off in medical school in 1974 and go to Uganda under the CIA when I was in medical school.
[02:35:09.514 --> 02:35:18.576]  They tried to recruit me right out of my medical school to take a year off and do a virology PhD working on retroviruses for the CIA, which turned out later to be the AIDS virus.
[02:35:19.116 --> 02:35:25.081]  And in the early 80s, when I saw my hemophiliac patients dying of this syndrome, I was wondering what the heck was going on.
[02:35:25.441 --> 02:35:29.084]  I was one of the first whistleblowers that saw this situation and notified the U.S.
[02:35:29.144 --> 02:35:33.528]  and Canadian governments and the Red Cross about the tainted blood.
[02:35:33.568 --> 02:35:36.891]  And I knew where the blood source was coming because I tracked it down and found out that these
[02:35:37.341 --> 02:35:41.343]  Maniacs were collecting blood from people who were known IV drug addicts.
[02:35:42.003 --> 02:35:43.664]  All of these things are done on purpose.
[02:35:44.284 --> 02:35:46.385]  The doctors don't check anything out.
[02:35:46.425 --> 02:35:48.206]  And if they do, they're terrified to speak.
[02:35:48.406 --> 02:35:48.807]  I'm not.
[02:35:48.827 --> 02:35:50.167]  I have only a forward gear.
[02:35:50.187 --> 02:35:57.071]  The Hemophilia Society got robbed and the doctor that was working at the prison there in Arkansas, where they were getting a bunch of the blood, got firebombed.
[02:35:57.451 --> 02:35:57.671]  Right.
[02:35:58.071 --> 02:36:03.634]  And what they do now is they also gave me plans for building the avian flu into a world pandemic.
[02:36:04.509 --> 02:36:08.172]  Why did the Army in the early 90s go dig up dead frozen whalers in the permafrost near the North Pole?
[02:36:25.211 --> 02:36:25.812]  Yeah, well they did.
[02:36:25.832 --> 02:36:27.313]  The Army loves us.
[02:36:27.873 --> 02:36:28.414]  Yeah, right.
[02:36:28.534 --> 02:36:39.504]  What they've done now is after 9-11, they went from BSL-3, which is biosafety level 2, to biosafety level 4 plus at university labs all across the United States.
[02:36:39.524 --> 02:36:41.746]  Three dozen labs part of BioShield.
[02:36:41.786 --> 02:36:42.667]  Tell folks about that.
[02:36:42.907 --> 02:36:45.608]  Well, BioShield, what they've done now is they've done two things.
[02:36:45.628 --> 02:36:54.332]  They've taken labs that had low levels of security and were dealing with relatively, you know, garden-variety dangerous viruses and bacteria in their laboratories that are affiliated with universities.
[02:36:54.712 --> 02:36:59.474]  And then what they did was, oh, properly improving their facilities for, like, negative-pressure facilities that have lockdown.
[02:36:59.514 --> 02:36:59.814]  That's right.
[02:36:59.894 --> 02:37:05.577]  University of Texas at Galveston is doing Level 4 in a Level 2 facility.
[02:37:05.777 --> 02:37:07.758]  Right, now here's what a Level 2 facility is.
[02:37:07.798 --> 02:37:15.484]  The guy that trained me, I trained in bacteriology back in the early seventies, the guy that trained me was a senior bacteriologist working with the U.S.
[02:37:15.524 --> 02:37:27.932]  military on the T-virus project and one day he was sick in 10 years and all of his buddies died in the facility because it went through BSL-4 lockdown, which means the facility automatically locks down when there's a breach of containment.
[02:37:28.353 --> 02:37:32.275]  The virus escaped and everybody, all his friends were incinerated and foamed at 2,000 degrees.
[02:37:33.576 --> 02:37:34.417]  That's what happens.
[02:37:34.657 --> 02:37:35.637]  They don't have this now.
[02:37:36.017 --> 02:37:49.784]  They have let these viruses, not only that, a year ago, the Russian BioLabs actually delivered all of their deadly viruses they've made over the last 70 years to the Bethesda, Maryland, and they're being distributed to universities right across America.
[02:37:49.804 --> 02:37:50.284]  Exactly!
[02:37:50.304 --> 02:37:51.264]  Remember two years ago?
[02:37:51.284 --> 02:37:54.486]  And these stories are every day, but it just got big two years ago.
[02:37:55.106 --> 02:38:02.698]  When the super flu got mailed to thousands of facilities, just regular FedEx?
[02:38:02.938 --> 02:38:04.120]  Yeah, it was a test kit.
[02:38:04.180 --> 02:38:05.782]  It was like, these people are nuts.
[02:38:05.902 --> 02:38:10.710]  Now, they've been testing on macaque monkeys in Winnipeg, Manitoba at the National
[02:38:11.430 --> 02:38:12.971]  Bacteriology, Virology Lab.
[02:38:13.631 --> 02:38:17.333]  They know, and here's a real story you need to know.
[02:38:18.254 --> 02:38:27.238]  I had on my show, both in Genesis when I was over at RBN for a while, I had Henry L. Nyman on my program roughly every two to four weeks for almost two years.
[02:38:28.039 --> 02:38:37.283]  And last summer I finally put the data together because I've been checking the actual genetic sequences and found all the lethal gene sequences of the 1918 flu showed up
[02:38:39.603 --> 02:38:41.725]  in the H5N1.
[02:38:42.765 --> 02:38:56.234]  Not only did they show up, it appeared when you look at the mapping, the map coincides with the flight path of British Airways jets over Asia and China, from Qinghai Game Reserve in Xinjiang to other areas of China where the first outbreaks occurred.
[02:38:57.032 --> 02:39:03.537]  If you look at the genetic genotype maps of where it's spread geologically... Well, scientists have also gone public saying it looks like it's been engineered.
[02:39:03.898 --> 02:39:05.679]  Right, well it has been, and I have the proof.
[02:39:05.719 --> 02:39:06.500]  Now here's what happened.
[02:39:06.940 --> 02:39:17.849]  When I finally presented all the documents, including the fact that I received the actual documents from scientists and doctors who smuggled it out of the Basel, Switzerland, WHO, March 16, 1997, they gave me the actual documents.
[02:39:21.039 --> 02:39:22.380]  Dr. Nyman freaked out.
[02:39:22.621 --> 02:39:28.085]  He won't come back on my show, because he knows that I know this thing can recombine, and it can.
[02:39:28.105 --> 02:39:31.048]  They made it into what's called a killer bees virus.
[02:39:31.068 --> 02:39:36.893]  This virus has a thing called a recombinant area in what's called the cleavage site of the H gene.
[02:39:36.913 --> 02:39:37.934]  There's eight genes.
[02:39:38.661 --> 02:39:52.766]  This cleavage site has six polybasic amino acids, which means it can enter any tissue of any mammal, that's any mammal, from rats to humans to whatever, and can grow in brain tissue, liver, anywhere, not just the respiratory tract.
[02:39:53.166 --> 02:39:56.327]  This was not present in 1971 at the University of Edinburgh.
[02:39:56.727 --> 02:39:58.067]  It has the same lethal genes.
[02:39:58.147 --> 02:40:03.309]  It's like winning the lottery with the same numbers on a different continent and a different virus, eighty-some years later.
[02:40:03.969 --> 02:40:06.210]  And when I presented all the data, he was
[02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:07.770]  Completely in shock.
[02:40:08.251 --> 02:40:17.514]  He realized that I knew that what was going on here is that we have a completely weaponized plague virus on the loose that may spontaneously turn into a global plague.
[02:40:17.534 --> 02:40:32.400]  But I was told in the actual documents by these doctors, and they were terrified when they gave me this data back in 1997, that their estimates that when this plague is released, and you called it that once, I guess a year ago, the Zychronian 12 plague, it'll kill at least two billion.
[02:40:33.166 --> 02:40:33.966]  That's their plan.
[02:40:34.426 --> 02:40:37.728]  The Russians have been saying 1 to 3 billion, but here's the thing.
[02:40:38.748 --> 02:40:42.489]  Now, the question is, has it mutated to go to humans because there hasn't been that many deaths?
[02:40:42.669 --> 02:40:43.970]  It will spontaneously.
[02:40:44.010 --> 02:40:57.895]  There's two amino acids in position 226 and 228 on the gene sequence of the H gene, and all they need is those amino acid substitution changes, which can occur by recombination with, say, H9N2 in the Middle East, like in Iraq or Yemen.
[02:40:58.893 --> 02:41:01.715]  Or the H3N2.
[02:41:01.915 --> 02:41:10.120]  In other words, there's those five basic amino acids, the lock and key to the cell receptor binding domain in human cells that's going to make this leap.
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:11.501]  And we don't know when.
[02:41:11.681 --> 02:41:15.483]  I don't know whether it's six months or two years, but I can tell you it's getting really damn close.
[02:41:16.304 --> 02:41:19.686]  And the problem is it could happen spontaneously, but it's an excellent cover.
[02:41:20.206 --> 02:41:25.969]  For a virus that you know they bio-engineered, they know that they released it, they know that eventually it was going to mutate.
[02:41:26.489 --> 02:41:28.751]  Well here's the question, the government isn't stupid.
[02:41:29.131 --> 02:41:40.977]  Why are they mailing out tens of thousands of super weaponized flu to be mailed to level 1 and 2 universities, to be in FedEx and UPS trucks everywhere.
[02:41:41.297 --> 02:41:43.238]  That came out a few years ago.
[02:41:43.598 --> 02:41:48.441]  Is that just a cover so when it does break out they can say, oh well that was just an accident.
[02:41:48.661 --> 02:42:02.009]  Yes, in fact, their plans, and I had this read from the inside from lots of different sources, Dr. Isley, the World Constituent Parliament Association in Colorado, the Snowmass Colorado, you know, all the World Watch Institute.
[02:42:02.409 --> 02:42:08.493]  I get the documents from the inside and from the people inside secure classified facilities in the U.S.
[02:42:08.533 --> 02:42:10.494]  government and above government organizations.
[02:42:11.244 --> 02:42:17.189]  They plan on reducing the world population 90 to 95 percent and they're getting ready to do it soon.
[02:42:17.390 --> 02:42:18.731]  And I'm not kidding when I say this.
[02:42:18.811 --> 02:42:19.912]  I'm not an extremist.
[02:42:19.952 --> 02:42:20.993]  I'm a positive person.
[02:42:21.393 --> 02:42:27.619]  But I can't, in all honesty, just sit aside practicing medicine and trying to be a good boy and not disturb the
[02:42:27.779 --> 02:42:42.906]  Well, regardless, we have the 1973 declassified CIA memorandum to the IMF and World Bank ordering the five most populous third world nations to forcibly sterilize half their women or not receive any funds as part of the Regiment Agreement.
[02:42:43.766 --> 02:42:45.127]  And so it's all in there.
[02:42:45.308 --> 02:42:53.233]  And we know that Australia in the late 50s put a biosterilization weapon in wheat and corn shipments to Asia.
[02:42:53.714 --> 02:42:56.516]  And we know that this is diabolical.
[02:42:56.596 --> 02:42:59.658]  What do you think is really behind this Merck vaccine?
[02:43:00.799 --> 02:43:08.944]  Well, the Merck vaccine, here's a couple of things, and I've talked about this with Dr. Blalock numerous times and checked all the science of it.
[02:43:09.344 --> 02:43:13.887]  These vaccines are to, number one, destroy the health of the population.
[02:43:14.348 --> 02:43:16.629]  They're to destroy... So they're soft kill weakeners?
[02:43:16.909 --> 02:43:19.452]  Right, basically this is a form of molecular genocide.
[02:43:19.833 --> 02:43:31.788]  They will, now this is the most important missing fact that no one's reported on, but if you take a virus and you put it into a weakened host with free radicals from, for example, now they're trying to pass this Codex Alimentarius.
[02:43:32.168 --> 02:43:33.049]  That's right.
[02:43:48.865 --> 02:44:10.364]  And they admitted that in the tanks where they inexpensively mass-breed these, already being spread on most of your things like bologna and sausages and things that they consider to be high problems with bacteria, it admitted that the problem is, and this is just the first problem, that the bacteria that they breed the viruses on secrete, that they defecate, and it's highly toxic.
[02:44:10.384 --> 02:44:13.207]  That's what makes you sick, folks, when you get food poisoning is the bacteria.
[02:44:13.547 --> 02:44:15.409]  It's their excretions are highly toxic.
[02:44:15.889 --> 02:44:16.891]  And 7 of 9 banned pesticides.
[02:44:16.911 --> 02:44:21.216]  Some of them are so lethal that if you give it to children under 5, 95% are dead within 48 hours.
[02:44:31.028 --> 02:44:46.733]  They're going to force nations to put hormones in all animal products irradiated with a hundred thousand times lethal dosages sprayed with sulfur fluoride that will calcify your basal ganglia of your brain and fry your pineal gland and your ability for your higher centers to work.
[02:44:47.493 --> 02:44:48.394]  This is unbelievable.
[02:44:48.434 --> 02:44:48.714]  This is
[02:44:49.914 --> 02:44:53.277]  Worse, this makes the Nazi death camps look like a party.
[02:44:53.317 --> 02:44:56.079]  Well, I'm a very observant person, and I go all over the country.
[02:44:56.279 --> 02:45:04.586]  Everyone I know, people that run five miles a day, people that swim a mile every morning, people that have never been sick, everyone in Vermont is coughing and hacking, not just in Austin.
[02:45:04.946 --> 02:45:06.728]  They say it's allergies all over the country.
[02:45:06.848 --> 02:45:08.209]  Everybody's constantly sick.
[02:45:08.609 --> 02:45:11.011]  People I know who've never been sick are sick all the time.
[02:45:11.371 --> 02:45:12.252]  What is going on?
[02:45:12.732 --> 02:45:13.833]  Well, there's a couple things.
[02:45:13.893 --> 02:45:17.937]  The first thing is that there is worldwide spread of depleted uranium.
[02:45:18.057 --> 02:45:29.868]  And since the Gulf War, every person in the world is breathing the equivalent of four to eight times the maximum uranium nanoparticle dust that is allowed by the Environmental Protection Agency for Uranium.
[02:45:29.929 --> 02:45:33.332]  And the detectors have picked it up from four to eight times is what I saw.
[02:45:33.632 --> 02:45:33.792]  Right.
[02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:50.271]  Same thing with the attack on Belgrade.
[02:45:50.311 --> 02:45:50.532]  Right.
[02:46:04.868 --> 02:46:06.811]  And the problem is that people don't understand.
[02:46:06.851 --> 02:46:10.335]  We not only have that, we have these third world countries with no environmental standards.
[02:46:10.355 --> 02:46:12.478]  90% of the trash in the world is burned.
[02:46:12.738 --> 02:46:24.132]  Then we have tens of thousands of private bioengineering labs randomly splashing DNA for new drug developments and plant developments in cross-species chimera development, which creates new amino acids.
[02:46:24.452 --> 02:46:38.383]  And now conclusive proof came out in the London Independent that the generally eaten genetically modified potatoes are completely toxic and creating massive spikes in cancers and over half the rats that eat these potatoes within three months develop fatal cancers.
[02:46:38.683 --> 02:46:42.186]  Right, and what's happening is when they insert genes they have now foods
[02:46:42.726 --> 02:46:54.835]  That in your grocery store have genes from as many as six different genera, phyla, and species which generate new amino acids, new toxic byproducts from these new weird metabolic processes that never before... Amino acids that have never existed!
[02:46:55.316 --> 02:47:01.861]  Never existed in history, on any life form on the planet, and on top of that, these are going to cause an explosion.
[02:47:01.881 --> 02:47:09.967]  What I see, if this is introduced, and this is according to Dr. Reema Laboe and Major General Stubblebine and their panel of expert doctors around the world,
[02:47:10.587 --> 02:47:13.169]  And AIDS has already killed how many million in Africa?
[02:47:27.635 --> 02:47:29.456]  Oh gosh, it's many millions.
[02:47:29.516 --> 02:47:32.537]  I mean, we have an entire generation of people that are gone.
[02:47:32.597 --> 02:47:34.698]  I know in Nigeria it's killed 20 million alone.
[02:47:34.938 --> 02:47:36.038]  Yeah, it's obscene.
[02:47:36.058 --> 02:47:41.080]  And they're well on their way to wiping out the 185 million quote excess Sub-Saharan Africans.
[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:44.082]  Some areas of Africa have upwards of 40% HIV infection.
[02:47:45.782 --> 02:47:55.150]  Right, and of course this vaccine was made specifically bioengineered to be not race specific, but could be much more lethal in the black races.
[02:47:55.210 --> 02:47:56.071]  We've seen it, I've seen it.
[02:47:56.091 --> 02:48:02.015]  They've done studies here where blacks that are sexually promiscuous as whites are upwards of 10 times more likely to get AIDS.
[02:48:02.256 --> 02:48:09.181]  Yes, and they have bioengineered species specific weapons as long ago as the early 1970s.
[02:48:10.780 --> 02:48:20.108]  And Dick Cheney said in the PNAC September 2000 Rebuilding America's Defenses documents that they need to use the press to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[02:48:20.308 --> 02:48:21.329]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:48:21.429 --> 02:48:27.814]  And it combines with the quote, non-lethal weapons, the radiation, the ELF, everything.
[02:48:27.934 --> 02:48:29.555]  Our world is falling apart.
[02:48:29.995 --> 02:48:31.697]  And we need to stop it with the truth.
[02:48:33.667 --> 02:48:36.228]  Man, you read the Bible, it talks about two-thirds being dead.
[02:48:36.268 --> 02:48:37.609]  I hope that's not what's gonna happen.
[02:48:37.949 --> 02:48:41.651]  Final segment with Dr. Deagle on the other side as we continue to investigate.
[02:48:41.671 --> 02:48:50.696]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:51.056 --> 02:48:52.977]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:48:53.357 --> 02:49:00.981]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:01.696 --> 02:49:08.740]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:09.140 --> 02:49:20.546]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.866 --> 02:49:24.448]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:24.848 --> 02:49:26.769]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:27.109 --> 02:49:30.871]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:51:46.875 --> 02:51:52.900]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:56.522]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:58.744 --> 02:52:02.987]  By exposing what the New World Order is doing, we may be able to back them off from launching this.
[02:52:03.067 --> 02:52:03.748]  That's why we're here.
[02:52:04.651 --> 02:52:05.672]  Discussing it today.
[02:52:05.712 --> 02:52:11.175]  I mean, it's hard for me to believe they openly announced viruses that attack your brain for your own good.
[02:52:11.635 --> 02:52:12.375]  But it's real.
[02:52:12.856 --> 02:52:19.259]  By the way, huge breaking development going up on JonesReport.com right now, along with that Aaron Russo and Nick Rockefeller photo.
[02:52:19.999 --> 02:52:20.660]  Affidavit.
[02:52:20.700 --> 02:52:22.281]  McVeigh had high-level help.
[02:52:22.461 --> 02:52:24.242]  Salt Lake City Tribune.
[02:52:24.742 --> 02:52:25.623]  Pamela Mason.
[02:52:25.643 --> 02:52:29.685]  According to Oklahoma City Bombing Conspirator, ranking officials were involved in the attack.
[02:52:30.245 --> 02:52:31.646]  Salt Lake City article.
[02:52:33.705 --> 02:52:48.714]  has now gotten the information that the city bombing conspirator Terry Nichols is a high-ranking FBI official apparently was directly directing Timothy McVeigh in the plot to blow up the government building and might have changed the original target of the attack according to a new affidavit filed in a U.S.
[02:52:49.054 --> 02:52:49.895]  court in Utah.
[02:52:50.295 --> 02:52:54.037]  Just more evidence coming out there of government-sponsored terror.
[02:52:55.078 --> 02:52:56.579]  We'll do a big report on this tomorrow.
[02:52:56.599 --> 02:52:58.060]  I get guest on with this tomorrow.
[02:52:58.600 --> 02:53:01.702]  It'll all be up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:53:02.581 --> 02:53:05.583]  Aaron is in there posting it right now on JonesReport.com.
[02:53:06.284 --> 02:53:17.413]  I hope that everybody will visit InfoWars.com and PrisonPundit.com and get my film Terror Storm, get America Freedom from Fascism, get these new little FM transmitters that plug into your audio jack and broadcast the truth to your neighbors.
[02:53:17.853 --> 02:53:20.535]  Take action, support us, we're going to win this fight with God's help.
[02:53:20.915 --> 02:53:29.382]  Dr. Deagle, in closing, it's encouraging to see the people now have no trust for the government and are across the board refusing these vaccines.
[02:53:30.511 --> 02:53:36.497]  I talked to doctors who say in their delivery rooms upwards of 40-50% of the parents are refusing vaccines now.
[02:53:36.957 --> 02:53:38.899]  The people don't trust the government anymore.
[02:53:39.019 --> 02:53:40.520]  I think they've really gone too far.
[02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:41.261]  What do you say to that?
[02:53:41.681 --> 02:53:54.413]  Absolutely, and I think also the medical profession, what I'm doing is I'm working with constitutional law experts that are actually working together to destroy this sham of administrative law that's trying to neutralize health professionals, dentists,
[02:53:54.853 --> 02:54:03.176]  I have cases we're working on right now, real cases of, for example, one dentist in Florida that lost two babies and she herself is sick and the state of Florida is harassing her.
[02:54:04.236 --> 02:54:05.336]  All these things are going to happen.
[02:54:05.376 --> 02:54:08.277]  What we're going to say is we're going to bring back constitutional rights.
[02:54:08.557 --> 02:54:10.438]  We're going to have professionals come out of the closet.
[02:54:10.658 --> 02:54:23.762]  We're going to give them a backbone so they can stand up to the regulatory bodies that are not using proper rules of evidence when they try to discipline them so that they can make them behave as good little Dr. Mangalas and that they need to get a life.
[02:54:24.362 --> 02:54:32.470]  And I will not live in a country or a world where I'm literally become a minion for the globalists that want to kill my family and myself.
[02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:40.137]  Well now they're announcing that doctors and nurses all have to be total tattletales, watching everyone, threatening you, finding out your political beliefs.
[02:54:40.598 --> 02:54:41.819]  They're opening our mail.
[02:54:41.899 --> 02:54:42.860]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:54:43.220 --> 02:54:45.861]  Yeah, in fact, here's what they're doing, and they started in Ohio.
[02:54:45.881 --> 02:54:54.486]  They're going to have the doctors report to the insurance carriers that patients are not taking the vaccines, not taking the cholesterol-lowering agents, which, by the way, cause heart failure.
[02:54:54.506 --> 02:55:00.929]  Remember the case of the guy who said he doesn't drink and drive, but he drinks a six-pack every night, and the doctor called DMV and they withdrew his license?
[02:55:00.989 --> 02:55:01.890]  No judge, no jury?
[02:55:02.250 --> 02:55:02.430]  Yeah.
[02:55:02.530 --> 02:55:05.533]  Well, listen, what they're doing is they're turning the doctors into doc cops.
[02:55:05.793 --> 02:55:07.254]  It's the same thing with pain medicine.
[02:55:07.635 --> 02:55:10.097]  There are now 50 million Americans that suffer in pain.
[02:55:10.417 --> 02:55:14.881]  Many millions commit suicide over a period of years because they can't get access.
[02:55:14.921 --> 02:55:15.321]  But guess what?
[02:55:15.341 --> 02:55:16.362]  They have a war on drugs.
[02:55:16.823 --> 02:55:20.886]  And pain doctors are going to jail and prison all the time just for doing their job.
[02:55:21.226 --> 02:55:23.208]  And meanwhile, the government's shipping in narcotics.
[02:55:23.468 --> 02:55:23.688]  Right.
[02:55:23.748 --> 02:55:32.535]  In fact, I took care of the pilots flying the C-130s out of Peterson Air Force Base in Buckley, the largest reserve Air Force base, and they're shipping it in by the pallet loads.
[02:55:32.875 --> 02:55:36.037]  The Department of Justice, the DEA, they are criminals.
[02:55:36.257 --> 02:55:38.059]  Power out your website, Dr. Diegel.
[02:55:38.399 --> 02:55:44.563]  Nutramedical, N-U-T-R-I, medical.com, and clayandiron, just like the book of Daniel, C-L-A-Y-A-N-D-I-R-O-N.com,
[02:55:47.185 --> 02:55:49.046]  Or they can call 888-212-8871.
[02:55:49.066 --> 02:55:51.766]  Thanks a lot, Alex, and thank you everyone.
[02:55:51.826 --> 02:55:55.608]  Get informed, get active, take an issue, and get moving on it now.
[02:55:55.888 --> 02:55:56.528]  You better jump.
[02:55:56.548 --> 02:55:58.528]  Your show's coming up here in just a few minutes on Genesis.
[02:55:58.568 --> 02:55:59.709]  Thank you for joining us, Dr. Deagle.

[02:56:01.729 --> 02:56:03.030]  Really appreciate him joining us.
[02:56:03.050 --> 02:56:05.491]  Don't forget, Genesis Communications has a new website.
[02:56:05.851 --> 02:56:07.951]  It's GCNRadio.net.
