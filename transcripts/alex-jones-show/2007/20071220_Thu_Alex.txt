[00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:09.925]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:11.425]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:13.066]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:17.508]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:22.030]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.353]  Well, here's the headline.
[00:00:32.794 --> 00:00:35.295]  Congress slams the Second Amendment.
[00:00:38.217 --> 00:00:38.858]  They've done it.
[00:00:39.158 --> 00:00:43.661]  They have passed the biggest gun control law fully.
[00:00:44.002 --> 00:00:46.123]  Not just out of the House, but now out of the Senate.
[00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:51.107]  In modern history, at least since the 1968 Gun Control Act.
[00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:54.250]  It is Thursday, the 20th day of December, 2007.
[00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.652]  Congress slams Second Amendment.
[00:01:01.744 --> 00:01:02.164]  The U.S.
[00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:15.690]  Congress has approved the first major gun control legislation in more than a decade, broadening background checks for gun buyers in the wake of a deadly campus shooting earlier this year by a mentally ill student.
[00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:19.531]  What does this really mean?
[00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:30.636]  It expands the federal database control, and it allows the government to take now 20% of the population that's been given some type of psychological designation,
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.543]  It'll of course expand that in the future and restrict your gun ownership rights.
[00:01:37.103 --> 00:01:39.924]  This has been dubbed the Veterans and Police Disarmament Act.
[00:01:40.605 --> 00:01:44.667]  Just like a bunch of police lost their jobs when they passed the Domestic Violence Act.
[00:01:45.947 --> 00:01:59.214]  That just means that the standard operating procedure of your wife putting a restraining order on you when she initiates a divorce, no violence, no threats be needed, that you can't own guns and you lose your job.
[00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:04.163]  And of course, a lot of people snickered about that and said it wasn't going to happen, and it indeed did.
[00:02:05.644 --> 00:02:08.886]  The Supreme Court ruled that that was unconstitutional.
[00:02:08.986 --> 00:02:09.687]  They don't care.
[00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:10.547]  It continues.
[00:02:11.508 --> 00:02:16.371]  And if you don't like it, they'll have some men dropped by with automatic weapons that'll take care of you, if you resist.
[00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:18.051]  No one to the who's cow.
[00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:21.954]  So a reign of terror is upon us.
[00:02:22.134 --> 00:02:25.596]  I predict the Supreme Court is going to rule early next year.
[00:02:26.778 --> 00:02:30.299]  They're set to hear the Second Amendment for the first time since the 30s.
[00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.801]  This is all planned out, and they will rule against the Second Amendment.
[00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.643]  You know, I told Larry Pratt a month ago, I said, I think this is going to pass.
[00:02:39.663 --> 00:02:45.525]  And he said, no, we've got this senator in there, and we're blocking it, and it looks like we've beaten it.
[00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:46.886]  And I said, I don't think you're right.
[00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:47.786]  I said that on air.
[00:02:49.487 --> 00:02:54.749]  And they're going to go after it in the Supreme Court, too.
[00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.550]  And there's a reason all of this is happening.
[00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.411]  There's a big reason all of this is happening.
[00:03:02.311 --> 00:03:03.791]  They're announcing torture's good.
[00:03:03.811 --> 00:03:05.472]  They're announcing there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:03:05.532 --> 00:03:06.932]  They're announcing there's no border.
[00:03:07.613 --> 00:03:08.953]  They're announcing all of this.
[00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:11.394]  They're making their move right now.
[00:03:12.614 --> 00:03:13.794]  It's happening right now.
[00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:16.155]  They're taking the mask off.
[00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:17.315]  They're taking the gloves off.
[00:03:17.356 --> 00:03:18.776]  They're dropping the curtain.
[00:03:19.916 --> 00:03:21.817]  Incidentally, I wasn't going to do the show today.
[00:03:22.197 --> 00:03:25.378]  I really shouldn't have done the show the last two days with the really bad sore throat and earaches.
[00:03:26.625 --> 00:03:30.086]  But when I saw this news this morning about the Second Amendment, I had to come in.
[00:03:31.447 --> 00:03:37.069]  And, uh, I'm just letting you know I'm sick, so if you wonder if there's a new talk show host doing a show, no, it's not.
[00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.909]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.611]  Plus, I feel so bad, it's worse to sit in bed.
[00:03:42.631 --> 00:03:46.112]  I don't know how to explain it, getting up and moving around.
[00:03:46.132 --> 00:03:48.493]  But I think I'm doing it to my detriment.
[00:03:48.533 --> 00:03:52.214]  I was having earaches last night so bad, I couldn't sleep.
[00:03:57.168 --> 00:04:06.432]  But I'm here live, ladies and gentlemen, and I should get my... I feel like when an engine hasn't been started in a while, I should get into my form and get cranking, get moving.
[00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:18.258]  Coming up here, ladies and gentlemen, throughout the transmission today, we're going to try to get Larry Pratt on to comment, or maybe JP, I thought we'd get Aaron Zellman to pop in and talk about this.
[00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:23.160]  And I've been telling you, the Second Amendment's under attack like never before.
[00:04:24.581 --> 00:04:26.242]  I've been trying to raise the alarm bells.
[00:04:27.202 --> 00:04:30.184]  I've been trying to warn people and talk more about it the last few months.
[00:04:31.645 --> 00:04:36.788]  Brace yourselves for a Supreme Court ruling against the Second Amendment.
[00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:43.432]  They're coming, they're not playing games, and they're going to move against us in a big way.
[00:04:44.593 --> 00:04:46.314]  And they're going to turn the police loose on us.
[00:04:47.415 --> 00:04:49.636]  So brace yourselves for impact next year.
[00:04:50.517 --> 00:04:53.719]  Brace yourselves for a whole other string of state shootings as well.
[00:04:54.614 --> 00:04:57.195]  The New World Order is moving right now!
[00:05:01.737 --> 00:05:03.138]  It is a big idea.
[00:05:03.158 --> 00:05:05.258]  A New World Order.
[00:05:05.959 --> 00:05:10.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.662]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:13.682 --> 00:05:15.923]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.463 --> 00:05:18.864]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.646 --> 00:05:26.985]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:34.986]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:38.909]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:41.831]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:43.032]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.072 --> 00:05:43.812]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.832 --> 00:05:44.893]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.113 --> 00:05:45.834]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.094 --> 00:05:47.235]  That's what they're after, you see.

[00:06:56.993 --> 00:06:59.615]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:06.244]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:14.493]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:07:14.753 --> 00:07:21.800]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.881]  We're good to go!
[00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:49.640]  We're good to go.
[00:08:19.631 --> 00:08:25.554]  All right, we're back live here, ladies and gentlemen, on this Thursday, 20th day of December, 2007 edition.
[00:08:27.335 --> 00:08:29.256]  By the way, I'm not going to be at that drug war premiere tonight.
[00:08:29.316 --> 00:08:30.037]  I just can't do it.
[00:08:30.617 --> 00:08:31.938]  I did a TV show last night.
[00:08:32.018 --> 00:08:35.159]  Didn't feel too good driving home at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.083]  But, uh, I was just invited to that, so I'm sorry if that was part of the billing and I'm going to be there.
[00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:41.823]  I'm not going to be there.
[00:08:42.703 --> 00:08:45.605]  Um, Congress slams Second Amendment.
[00:08:47.225 --> 00:08:47.886]  The U.S.
[00:08:48.046 --> 00:08:57.994]  Congress has approved the first major gun control legislation in more than a decade, broadening background checks, i.e.
[00:08:58.095 --> 00:09:06.302]  federal control, for gun buyers in the wake of a deadly campus shooting earlier this year by a mentally ill student.
[00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:09.404]  Now, he'd already been adjudicated mentally ill.
[00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:10.886]  It had already been put in the database.
[00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:14.576]  And you're never going to stop these people.
[00:09:14.596 --> 00:09:18.418]  They've had shootings in the last two weeks at bus stops and shopping malls.
[00:09:19.599 --> 00:09:21.179]  You can't put a cop on every corner.
[00:09:21.199 --> 00:09:24.901]  And then sometimes they go crazy and shoot people.
[00:09:25.442 --> 00:09:26.522]  They're human beings too.
[00:09:27.183 --> 00:09:34.367]  The legislation approved Wednesday by the Senate provides government funds to improve the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.
[00:09:35.327 --> 00:09:38.589]  The main way gun purchases are monitored in America.
[00:09:39.474 --> 00:09:39.794]  That's right.
[00:09:59.602 --> 00:10:10.312]  It's their own special federal court system run by them, and maybe one out of a thousand people who have their brain eaten by this stuff get a quiet payout of a couple hundred grand.
[00:10:14.996 --> 00:10:16.498]  If you're able to run this gauntlet.
[00:10:16.778 --> 00:10:17.879]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.225]  Remember Bill Clinton put the names of hundreds of thousands of veterans of Vietnam, Desert Storm,
[00:10:25.808 --> 00:10:26.308]  We're good to go!
[00:10:56.164 --> 00:10:57.404]  You know, one of these drugs on you.
[00:10:57.844 --> 00:11:10.228]  Because you went to the insurance company and your psychologist or psychiatrist put in a false diagnosis.
[00:11:10.248 --> 00:11:12.328]  Most of the diseases are just totally made up.
[00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:15.449]  There's no scientific testing to prove it.
[00:11:15.489 --> 00:11:16.430]  It's total quackery.
[00:11:16.770 --> 00:11:18.110]  And you thought it was cute and funny.
[00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.231]  No, you're not going to be able to own guns anymore.
[00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:26.509]  That's a very broad definition in here.
[00:11:31.892 --> 00:11:35.995]  Existing laws prevent mentally ill people and convicted felons from legally owning firearms.
[00:11:36.035 --> 00:11:36.215]  See?
[00:11:36.715 --> 00:11:37.515]  Mentally ill.
[00:11:39.256 --> 00:11:44.740]  But many states lack the funds to keep their information up to date and report it to the NICS.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.762]  So see, now all those reports, all those
[00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:52.870]  I know a lot of people went to college and they go, hey, you need to go through financial aid.
[00:11:52.910 --> 00:11:54.531]  We've seen you've got some low test scores here.
[00:11:55.312 --> 00:11:57.013]  And then people go through financial aid.
[00:11:57.073 --> 00:11:58.914]  I've read about this and been told about it.
[00:11:58.934 --> 00:12:02.896]  And they tell them, oh, just go see the college psychologist.
[00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:07.939]  You're having a date here with them on this date.
[00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:09.200]  And then you go to some facility.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:17.005]  And then they, no judge, no jury, but they adjudicate that you've got ADHD or that you're bipolar.
[00:12:18.843 --> 00:12:20.064]  You're like, hey, goody!
[00:12:22.145 --> 00:12:24.086]  I'm getting half my tuition paid for!
[00:12:24.946 --> 00:12:26.207]  Nothing comes for free.
[00:12:27.647 --> 00:12:28.828]  Nothing comes for free.
[00:12:29.528 --> 00:12:35.031]  If they can't get you on welfare, if they can't get you in the criminal justice system, they're going to adjudicate you mentally ill.
[00:12:36.532 --> 00:12:43.195]  The measure, the first gun legislation approved since 94, passed by voice vote in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.
[00:12:44.355 --> 00:12:45.336]  By the way, that's not true.
[00:12:45.376 --> 00:12:46.396]  They expanded NICS in 2000.
[00:12:48.323 --> 00:12:54.448]  A credible federal database to provide accurate background checks benefits everyone, said Senator Patrick Leahy.
[00:12:54.468 --> 00:12:57.470]  Really, this is a federal database in all the local police departments, period.
[00:12:58.331 --> 00:13:02.875]  One of the co-sponsors of the bill that arose following the deadliest campus shooting in U.S.
[00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:03.255]  history.
[00:13:04.056 --> 00:13:05.277]  Now, don't hold your breath.
[00:13:05.337 --> 00:13:06.978]  Bush says he's going to sign this.
[00:13:08.499 --> 00:13:11.421]  He also said he would sign the assault weapons ban.
[00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:13.583]  But don't tell a Bush supporter that.
[00:13:13.603 --> 00:13:14.524]  They'll call you a liar.
[00:13:16.215 --> 00:13:27.241]  Their fantasy land, and living in that fantasy land, and continuing that candy land fantasy land, is more important to them than our Second Amendment heritage and the very linchpin of liberty.
[00:13:28.262 --> 00:13:31.083]  These people make me literally sick.
[00:13:31.703 --> 00:13:33.024]  They're always smiley-faced.
[00:13:33.344 --> 00:13:34.445]  They're always doe-eyed.
[00:13:34.745 --> 00:13:36.126]  They always think they're conservative.
[00:13:36.346 --> 00:13:38.107]  They're enemies of the Republic.
[00:13:40.885 --> 00:13:48.409]  Improving the background check system and culling erroneous records will help curb the number of firearms that get into the hands of troubled individuals.
[00:13:48.849 --> 00:13:50.910]  See, now it's troubled individuals.
[00:13:51.551 --> 00:13:52.171]  Lay, he said.
[00:13:52.611 --> 00:13:55.913]  In April, a mentally deranged gunman shot and killed 31 people.
[00:13:55.953 --> 00:13:57.754]  He was on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[00:13:59.355 --> 00:14:00.595]  He'd been in psychiatric care.
[00:14:01.116 --> 00:14:05.418]  And then himself at Virginia Tech University, the police stood down for more than three hours, I would add.
[00:14:09.864 --> 00:14:13.026]  Sparking widespread calls for tighter gun control laws.
[00:14:13.046 --> 00:14:13.787]  Yeah, every time.
[00:14:13.847 --> 00:14:14.867]  Just always more, more, more.
[00:14:16.908 --> 00:14:23.432]  The shooter, South Korean-born Cho, 23, an English major, brought two handguns.
[00:14:23.452 --> 00:14:26.795]  He would have the police and professors recognize that he was mentally disturbed.
[00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:36.220]  The campus shooter made it clear that the background check system for potential gun buyers needs to have better information, better technology, and clearer standards.
[00:14:36.801 --> 00:14:38.902]  It's Representative John Dingell.
[00:14:39.611 --> 00:14:42.973]  A Democrat who co-authored the bill that passed in the House in June.
[00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:51.719]  The measure, which added a number of changes after the House version passed, was supported by the powerful gun lobby, who have supported every gun bill in U.S.
[00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:52.099]  history.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.760]  Every gun bill that's passed.
[00:14:54.501 --> 00:15:00.565]  The National Rifle Association, or the National Registry of American Firearm Owners.
[00:15:01.505 --> 00:15:02.426]  I'm being sarcastic there.
[00:15:02.446 --> 00:15:04.007]  Let me think of a good acronym to make fun of them.
[00:15:08.169 --> 00:15:09.770]  Roundup of Arms.
[00:15:10.711 --> 00:15:11.871]  What's a good acronym for them?
[00:15:12.171 --> 00:15:17.234]  See, but you can't tell a good ol' boy that the NRA is the actual father of gun control.
[00:15:18.315 --> 00:15:19.576]  They're not ready to learn that.
[00:15:20.737 --> 00:15:22.698]  They can't believe that Bush is going to sign this.
[00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:25.940]  They will when they hear he signs it say they support it, though.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.181]  See, they want to feel like they're winners.
[00:15:28.681 --> 00:15:31.963]  So they just agree with whatever wins, you see.
[00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:36.606]  They've got it all figured out, don't they?
[00:15:37.848 --> 00:15:51.619]  That's why you're going to have your dollar destroyed and your 401k is destroyed and that's why you're going to end up complete slaves and you're still going to love the mainstream media and the people that did it to you while it happens.
[00:15:55.962 --> 00:16:01.387]  The measure which added a number of changes after the House version passed was supported by the powerful
[00:16:02.595 --> 00:16:05.277]  Gun control, anti-gun organization, I would add.
[00:16:05.477 --> 00:16:06.057]  They don't say that.
[00:16:06.337 --> 00:16:14.922]  Powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association, NRA, and now awaits President George W. Bush's signature to become law.
[00:16:16.163 --> 00:16:22.867]  The end product is a win for American gun owners, the NRA said in a statement describing the measure as pro-gun legislation.
[00:16:23.007 --> 00:16:24.347]  Oh yeah, sure it is.
[00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:29.070]  Expanded federal control and an attack on veterans and gun owners.
[00:16:30.051 --> 00:16:30.391]  Police.
[00:16:31.943 --> 00:16:32.923]  Number of safeguards.
[00:16:32.943 --> 00:16:34.784]  I love those.
[00:16:34.804 --> 00:16:38.244]  Kind of like they're going to build a border fence and they just cut the funding out of that.
[00:16:39.364 --> 00:16:47.186]  Yesterday, too, while you're busy sucking your thumbs and that rather than acting stylish and putting your W stickers on your cars.
[00:16:47.966 --> 00:16:57.807]  A number of safeguards were built in legislation so that people who have overcome a disqualifying mental illness or disability may reclaim their rights.
[00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.488]  Oh, they may at the discretion of the federal board.
[00:17:01.255 --> 00:17:04.616]  I've got ownership through federal relief from disabilities programs.
[00:17:05.616 --> 00:17:21.639]  Kind of like New York said 50 years ago, don't worry, you can get a permit, and then it's been in the news, you've got to give on average about $30,000 for political campaigns, and then really all that has guns are billionaires and known mafia dons.
[00:17:22.479 --> 00:17:24.980]  They're all licensed in New York City.
[00:17:27.954 --> 00:17:31.998]  And that Mob Boss daily run in Chicago.
[00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:33.999]  Big gun control boy up there.
[00:17:35.981 --> 00:17:39.384]  Anywhere you got Chess Pit, Mob Boss is running things.
[00:17:39.424 --> 00:17:41.745]  You think Mob Bosses want their slaves armed?
[00:17:45.268 --> 00:17:46.049]  Makes me sick.
[00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:50.653]  Look, I declare war on the NRA in the Info War.
[00:17:50.693 --> 00:17:51.994]  I'm going to write article after article.
[00:17:52.374 --> 00:17:53.375]  I'm going to expose them.
[00:17:55.617 --> 00:17:58.280]  I am going to try to make sure they lose as many members as possible.
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:17:59.981]  I told you to join gun owners.
[00:18:01.362 --> 00:18:04.945]  I told you, folks, and I know we don't have... I wish we had more people.
[00:18:05.005 --> 00:18:06.527]  I wish... I know you're the salt of the earth.
[00:18:07.347 --> 00:18:08.428]  And I know you fight hard.
[00:18:09.229 --> 00:18:10.670]  But I told you this was going to pass.
[00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:11.851]  And let me just tell you right now.
[00:18:13.152 --> 00:18:14.834]  See, Larry Pratt won't even be pessimistic.
[00:18:15.014 --> 00:18:16.535]  I know what they're writing on the wall, okay?
[00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:19.498]  Let me tell you what else is going to... Everything's passing right now.
[00:18:24.181 --> 00:18:25.942]  I'll tell you what's going to pass next year.
[00:18:26.662 --> 00:18:30.404]  The Supreme Court, and it's going to be hailed as pro-gun, just like this was.
[00:18:31.164 --> 00:18:33.886]  Now let me tell you exactly what's going to happen.
[00:18:33.906 --> 00:18:34.866]  Do you want me to tell you exactly?
[00:18:35.066 --> 00:18:36.427]  And I'm not being arrogant here!
[00:18:37.187 --> 00:18:39.008]  I just want people to listen to me!
[00:18:39.329 --> 00:18:41.009]  I don't want to lose our Second Amendment!
[00:18:42.190 --> 00:18:44.971]  I know, but everybody else has got it all figured out.
[00:18:46.512 --> 00:18:48.213]  Everybody's got it all figured out but me.
[00:18:51.058 --> 00:18:54.199]  Well, let me just tell you what this country bumpkin says is going to happen, okay?
[00:18:56.739 --> 00:19:01.980]  They're going to come in and say, oh, you've got a right to own firearms under restrictions by law.
[00:19:03.341 --> 00:19:05.621]  With reasonable restrictions by law.
[00:19:05.661 --> 00:19:07.902]  Now, the second amendment is the big law.
[00:19:08.562 --> 00:19:11.222]  It's the big ten commandments, the first ten amendments.
[00:19:11.903 --> 00:19:16.824]  It's the one that can't be superseded or amended or blocked by any branch of government or anyone.
[00:19:18.004 --> 00:19:18.304]  Okay?
[00:19:19.972 --> 00:19:21.072]  And back then they knew what it meant.
[00:19:21.292 --> 00:19:24.753]  When you got out of prison, if you'd been arrested with guns, they gave you your guns back.
[00:19:26.133 --> 00:19:28.234]  They had a lot lower crime rate back then, by the way, too.
[00:19:29.574 --> 00:19:31.734]  But if you'd done something violent, you were going to hang high for it.
[00:19:34.355 --> 00:19:37.735]  Now, when we get back, I'll tell you what's going to happen.
[00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:40.356]  A new reign is upon us.
[00:19:42.096 --> 00:19:47.157]  And, uh, get ready for scores of states and cities to come after your guns.
[00:19:47.842 --> 00:19:52.446]  We're gonna call it the War on Illegal Guns, and it's gonna make the drug war look like a tea party.
[00:19:53.546 --> 00:19:54.027]  Get ready!
[00:19:55.128 --> 00:19:56.268]  Hell is gonna be released!
[00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.890]  Ted Anders from Midas, December 20th, 2007.
[00:19:57.930 --> 00:20:02.293]  Gold 797, 10 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $821.20, $404.75 for half, $202.38 for quarter.
[00:20:02.413 --> 00:20:02.773]  That's $821.20, $404.75, and $202.38.
[00:20:16.064 --> 00:20:19.347]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[00:20:19.647 --> 00:20:23.851]  He's been branded by special interest groups as Dr. No, refusing to bend his values.
[00:20:24.231 --> 00:20:28.215]  I could only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[00:20:28.595 --> 00:20:30.417]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:32.599]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[00:20:32.879 --> 00:20:38.883]  The ideas of strong currency, ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[00:20:39.143 --> 00:20:45.927]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[00:20:46.267 --> 00:20:47.147]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[00:20:47.207 --> 00:20:48.068]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:56.694]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[00:20:56.834 --> 00:20:57.094]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:20:57.214 --> 00:20:58.795]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[00:21:16.008 --> 00:21:21.932]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:21:22.192 --> 00:21:28.176]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:21:28.416 --> 00:21:29.377]  But they're not cheating.
[00:21:29.597 --> 00:21:31.599]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.101]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:21:38.201 --> 00:21:45.703]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:21:45.743 --> 00:21:46.364]  Get control.
[00:21:46.584 --> 00:21:47.144]  Get relief.
[00:21:47.224 --> 00:21:47.904]  Get some sleep.
[00:21:48.024 --> 00:21:51.225]  Go to www.OutIn90.com.
[00:21:51.345 --> 00:21:54.726]  That's www.OutIn90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:54.986]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:05.211]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.832 --> 00:22:14.762]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:15.223 --> 00:22:22.411]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:23.115 --> 00:22:28.597]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:29.097 --> 00:22:39.920]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.741]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:43.261 --> 00:22:44.681]  For more information, call 702-953-7000.
[00:22:50.452 --> 00:22:51.593]  We're good.

[00:23:45.999 --> 00:23:48.961]  These radios are not available anywhere else and for a limited time.
[00:23:49.162 --> 00:23:49.842]  So call now.
[00:23:50.062 --> 00:23:50.242]  Dial 877-817-9829.
[00:23:50.262 --> 00:23:53.105]  That's 877-817-9829 and get your Sony GT-160S AM-FM shortwave radio and CD player from the power...
[00:24:20.888 --> 00:24:27.212]  By the way, we're going to have Daniel Espelin joining us from Spain tomorrow with more info on the plot to kill Ron Paul.
[00:24:31.795 --> 00:24:34.737]  Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman are joining us in the third hour today.
[00:24:34.757 --> 00:24:40.561]  We're going to have wide open phones in the meantime at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:40.761 --> 00:24:45.544]  Let me break down how this is going to happen.
[00:24:47.665 --> 00:24:50.127]  Remember, this shows both parties are together.
[00:24:51.465 --> 00:25:02.168]  They vote together on open borders, they vote together on amnesty, they vote together on the wars, they vote together on every issue and every policy that the globalists want in place.
[00:25:02.188 --> 00:25:16.052]  In fact, the government, state, local, federal, is consistently on the polar opposite end of where the people are and, it just so happens, where the Constitution and Bill of Rights are.
[00:25:16.696 --> 00:25:21.559]  That's what happens in the Constitutional Bill of Rights when the people are given a choice as to what they choose.
[00:25:22.919 --> 00:25:29.763]  Though the public's dumbed down and doesn't know the basics of how society operates, they know they're being lied to and they know that they want more freedom.
[00:25:31.944 --> 00:25:38.287]  And so we're going to end up probably with Hillary Clinton, unless there's a miracle and Ron Paul gets elected and we should push for that as hard as we can.
[00:25:39.348 --> 00:25:43.850]  Imagine Hillary with all three branches of the government under her control.
[00:25:46.286 --> 00:25:50.750]  You go, well, wait a minute, they've got, you know, seven of the nine Republicans in the Supremes.
[00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.592]  They keep voting almost exactly as Hillary does.
[00:25:55.413 --> 00:25:56.354]  Just like Bush does.
[00:25:57.175 --> 00:26:04.120]  I mean, he'll have some rhetoric about stem cells, or rhetoric about global warming, and then meanwhile he's signing on to all of it.
[00:26:05.642 --> 00:26:06.042]  That's it.
[00:26:06.082 --> 00:26:07.603]  They'll have a few football issues.
[00:26:09.885 --> 00:26:13.468]  But now, don't go in gun shops and tell them this is more gun control.
[00:26:13.488 --> 00:26:14.909]  They'll tell you to get out of their shop.
[00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:19.490]  They'll tell you, hail Bush, repeatedly, and they will just stick their head in the dirt.
[00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:20.390]  At least some of them will.
[00:26:21.791 --> 00:26:22.891]  And they've already given in.
[00:26:22.911 --> 00:26:27.833]  You talk to gun shop owners and go, yeah, we know it's going to be banned soon, whatever, I'm moving into a vitamin business.
[00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:32.254]  Or I'm moving into a fish bait business, huh?
[00:26:32.894 --> 00:26:34.735]  Yeah, I know, we're going to lose it, huh?
[00:26:34.755 --> 00:26:35.835]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:37.915]  And that's why we're losers.
[00:26:37.975 --> 00:26:40.636]  That's why we're losing this country, is it's that type of attitude.
[00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:42.937]  They're just dirtbag little merchants.
[00:26:43.692 --> 00:26:44.672]  Who just want to make money.
[00:26:44.732 --> 00:26:45.893]  Not all of them, but a lot of them.
[00:26:46.433 --> 00:26:51.974]  And I've had gun shops gripe at me and say, how dare you say the NICS is a registration system?
[00:26:52.275 --> 00:26:53.615]  That scares people off.
[00:26:55.695 --> 00:26:57.436]  It does register you as a gun owner.
[00:26:58.256 --> 00:27:01.337]  And they can, whenever they want, get those records and they'll find out exactly what you want.
[00:27:01.657 --> 00:27:03.498]  And now this expands those databases.
[00:27:04.758 --> 00:27:06.499]  Instead of 160, 170 million gun owners,
[00:27:12.282 --> 00:27:24.688]  Getting involved, getting mobilized, getting our Second Amendment back, you decided to just cowardly roll over, and, I better not make waves, the BATF might come in here, they do that to gun shops that speak up!
[00:27:24.708 --> 00:27:27.409]  My boot are going home with them!
[00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:30.231]  Well, as soon as you have that attitude, it's over!
[00:27:31.031 --> 00:27:31.591]  You understand?
[00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:40.656]  As soon as you roll over, as soon as you bend over, as soon as you start trying to lick boots, people are gonna, people that like to have their boots licked, are gonna come up and say, okay, lick my boots!
[00:27:41.718 --> 00:27:43.420]  Get down in the dust and lick my boots.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:43.641]  There.
[00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:44.301]  Good.
[00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:45.523]  Lick the bottom of the boot.
[00:27:45.923 --> 00:27:47.165]  Lick it real clean.
[00:27:47.225 --> 00:27:48.306]  Oh, yes, sir.
[00:27:49.147 --> 00:27:50.129]  Oh, I love you.
[00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:51.691]  Oh, I love you, Bug.
[00:27:51.751 --> 00:27:52.832]  I love you, Hillary.
[00:27:53.172 --> 00:27:53.933]  Oh, yes, sir.
[00:27:56.345 --> 00:28:01.167]  I'll buy all the little police stickers you mail out that are from fake police fraternal groups.
[00:28:01.187 --> 00:28:02.688]  The cops don't even care that you have them.
[00:28:02.968 --> 00:28:07.150]  I'll stick them all over my car to show the cops I like them.
[00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:08.510]  Leave me alone.
[00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.011]  I want to grovel to the system.
[00:28:11.391 --> 00:28:12.332]  Please!
[00:28:12.812 --> 00:28:13.873]  Please!
[00:28:17.054 --> 00:28:19.695]  Nothing will help you cowardly chicken neck!
[00:28:20.552 --> 00:28:24.334]  The more you submit to the new world order, the worse it's gonna get.
[00:28:24.815 --> 00:28:27.216]  And that's my one dark solace.
[00:28:27.236 --> 00:28:29.338]  And I shouldn't be a dark person, but I have that side.
[00:28:29.678 --> 00:28:34.981]  It's with all you cowardly trash that helped destroy my beloved republic.
[00:28:35.642 --> 00:28:40.965]  All of you that went along with the 50 million abortions and the open borders and the sellouts of our industry.
[00:28:41.365 --> 00:28:46.709]  You're gonna be poor and broke and destitute on top of being stupid.
[00:28:48.633 --> 00:28:59.021]  And so you're gonna pay for all you've done, you dirtbag, mainline, chicken-necked, know-it-all liberals, you scumbag, fake conservatives.
[00:29:01.763 --> 00:29:04.044]  I'm so upset about what's happening to this country.
[00:29:04.084 --> 00:29:07.927]  I'm so disgusted seeing it all by the book come down.
[00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:11.690]  I'm not talking to 90% of my audience.
[00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.752]  I'm talking to that 10% that listens because they hate me.
[00:29:15.598 --> 00:29:19.259]  I'm talking about that 10% that won't admit how deep the tyranny has gotten.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:28.221]  Well, you just remember next year, they're going to come out and say, yeah, you got a second amendment when prescribed by law.
[00:29:29.482 --> 00:29:32.783]  And they're going to pass DC style gun bans, coast to coast.
[00:29:34.883 --> 00:29:35.883]  And you're going to submit.
[00:29:37.104 --> 00:29:38.204]  You'll turn your guns in.
[00:29:39.238 --> 00:29:42.380]  A lot of these good old boys out there will start saying, well, maybe we don't need them.
[00:29:42.821 --> 00:29:45.643]  I'd still have a shotgun if I have all my paperwork in order.
[00:29:47.003 --> 00:29:47.724]  They'll submit.
[00:29:52.047 --> 00:29:52.968]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.448 --> 00:29:55.049]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:58.672]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.641 --> 00:30:07.306]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH-balanced alkaline environment.
[00:30:07.486 --> 00:30:12.650]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:17.994]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[00:30:18.294 --> 00:30:21.857]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[00:30:22.077 --> 00:30:22.497]  I'm good to go!
[00:30:49.133 --> 00:30:51.536]  Up to the pH of 10, with only 10 drops.
[00:30:51.896 --> 00:30:58.083]  Order your bottle of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops now by going directly to alkavision.com.
[00:30:58.364 --> 00:30:59.785]  Again, that's alkavision.com.
[00:31:01.129 --> 00:31:02.609]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Dimon.
[00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:08.451]  You can now get the most important package ever on what has happened to the Catholic Church in the last 50 years.
[00:31:08.931 --> 00:31:16.874]  Find out how this massive crisis concerning the Catholic Church happened, what happened, and how the Bible predicted it would take place in the last days.
[00:31:17.374 --> 00:31:20.975]  The package contains 6 DVDs that contain 10 different programs.
[00:31:21.295 --> 00:31:21.635]  I think so.
[00:31:51.215 --> 00:31:54.898]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:31:54.938 --> 00:31:56.580]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:32:01.011 --> 00:32:01.411]  Attention!
[00:32:01.532 --> 00:32:04.334]  This is an extremely urgent GCN Health News Bulletin.
[00:32:04.634 --> 00:32:08.938]  If you're interested in suppressed natural cures, this will be the most important message you will ever hear.
[00:32:09.258 --> 00:32:09.939]  Listen closely.
[00:32:10.599 --> 00:32:18.065]  77 GCN listeners are needed immediately to test an amazing blacklisted herbal product, considered to be the single most powerful traditional remedy on Earth.
[00:32:18.346 --> 00:32:24.811]  In fact, medical studies in other countries have been conducted on the astonishing effects this rare mineral-like compound has had on arthritis, obesity,
[00:32:24.991 --> 00:32:25.331]  I think so.
[00:32:48.687 --> 00:32:52.249]  Shipments will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you move quickly.
[00:32:52.489 --> 00:32:55.771]  That's www.blacklistedherb.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:32:55.791 --> 00:32:57.713]  Congressman Paul, welcome to the program, sir.
[00:33:04.278 --> 00:33:04.738]  Thank you, Glenn.
[00:33:04.778 --> 00:33:05.479]  Nice to be with you.
[00:33:05.619 --> 00:33:06.600]  Okay.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:23.350]  You're on the campaign trail, which is the reason why you're not in the studio now, and I want to get to some of your more controversial positions later on in the program, but I thought we would start on a few of the things that I almost never see anybody talk about with you, the real things that most conservatives do agree with you on.
[00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:27.613]  I want to start by playing a clip of something you said just last week in the debate in Iowa.
[00:33:30.295 --> 00:33:33.759]  Reread the oath of office, take it seriously, obey the Constitution.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.903]  We are well defended against all enemies foreign.
[00:33:37.123 --> 00:33:41.428]  We should be much more careful about defending against the enemies domestic.
[00:33:42.329 --> 00:33:46.814]  Who, sir, do you believe are the enemies domestic?
[00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:50.688]  I don't see them as individuals or personalities.
[00:33:50.748 --> 00:33:54.693]  I see it as a philosophic danger endorsed by the status quo.
[00:33:54.793 --> 00:34:03.363]  Most members of Congress, most members who have been in the executive branch over the years, the undermining of our personal economic liberties, our personal liberties, our privacy.
[00:34:03.383 --> 00:34:07.548]  There's been a special erosion of these privacy issues since 9-11.
[00:34:08.809 --> 00:34:11.671]  So something's been ingrained in our system.
[00:34:11.751 --> 00:34:17.594]  Economic liberty is very, very important, but that's been undermined for 70 or 80 years, especially since the Depression.
[00:34:17.614 --> 00:34:21.216]  So I see him in philosophic terms rather than in personality terms.
[00:34:22.657 --> 00:34:23.978]  Let me go to the UN.
[00:34:24.018 --> 00:34:25.539]  You say the UN shouldn't even exist.
[00:34:27.725 --> 00:34:30.927]  Well, I don't have any saying about whether they should exist or not.
[00:34:30.987 --> 00:34:34.349]  I just am arguing that it's not in our best interest to be in the U.N.
[00:34:34.369 --> 00:34:36.250]  The very first thing the U.N.
[00:34:36.290 --> 00:34:39.632]  did after World War II was they took us to war.
[00:34:39.692 --> 00:34:42.173]  I mean, Truman went to war, didn't even tell the Congress.
[00:34:42.213 --> 00:34:44.115]  And, you know, we're still in Korea.
[00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:46.476]  And, you know, the Constitution is very clear.
[00:34:46.516 --> 00:34:47.957]  Only Congress can declare war.
[00:34:47.977 --> 00:34:49.338]  A lot of men died over there.
[00:34:49.398 --> 00:34:51.619]  So I don't like going to war under the U.N.
[00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:51.999]  banner.
[00:34:52.259 --> 00:34:53.640]  You say the choice is very clear.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.021]  We either follow the Constitution or submit to U.N.
[00:34:56.041 --> 00:34:56.822]  global governance.
[00:34:57.663 --> 00:34:58.825]  I happen to agree with you, sir.
[00:34:58.845 --> 00:35:00.387]  I mean, I see the Lost Treaty.
[00:35:00.467 --> 00:35:08.158]  I see the issue of global warming as nothing but trying to entangle us and the rest of the world into one world government.
[00:35:08.558 --> 00:35:09.780]  Would you agree or disagree with that?
[00:35:10.766 --> 00:35:11.807]  No, no, I agree with it.
[00:35:11.847 --> 00:35:13.728]  I think our trade agreements do the same thing.
[00:35:13.768 --> 00:35:22.755]  You know, whether it's the WTO or, you know, the World Bank or the IMF or NAFTA or CAPTA, these are taking away our sovereignty.
[00:35:23.796 --> 00:35:29.340]  Even today, the WTO today was telling us that we shouldn't pass this agriculture bill.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:35.005]  I'll probably, you know, not vote for the agriculture bill, but should I do it because the WTO tells me not to?
[00:35:35.405 --> 00:35:40.569]  So I don't like this undermining of our national sovereignty, and we've allowed this to
[00:35:41.309 --> 00:35:59.197]  You have said, though, that this is not some, if I may quote you, it is not as much a sinister conspiracy, the knowledge is out there, if you just look for it, you realize that our national sovereignty is under threat, but I have to tell you, we're going to get into economics here in a few minutes, but when you look at both parties,
[00:35:59.837 --> 00:36:00.778]  You will see them.
[00:36:00.838 --> 00:36:03.681]  I mean, look at the budget that has recently come out.
[00:36:04.282 --> 00:36:10.087]  You'll see that they are almost intentionally sabotaging us every step of the way.
[00:36:10.448 --> 00:36:20.197]  How else could you explain some of the things that are going on at the border with the lost treaty, with our budget, our monetary policies?
[00:36:20.538 --> 00:36:23.821]  I mean, how do you say it's not a sinister conspiracy?
[00:36:24.762 --> 00:36:37.033]  Yeah, I guess it may be semantics that we're dealing with, but I see it as a conspiracy in the sense that some people believe in globalism, some people believe in the North American Union, I don't.
[00:36:37.213 --> 00:36:41.597]  It used to be more secretive, you know, the New World Order was talked about 30 or 40 years ago.
[00:36:42.277 --> 00:36:43.998]  And nobody would say it out in open.
[00:36:44.038 --> 00:36:51.383]  Now they talk about the New World Order, so it's not as secretive and it's not as conspiratorial as it was 50 or 60 years ago.
[00:36:51.743 --> 00:36:54.885]  People believe in internationalism and I think they're very sincere.
[00:36:54.905 --> 00:36:57.867]  They just think the world would be better off if we had one world government.
[00:36:58.327 --> 00:36:58.707]  I don't.
[00:36:58.767 --> 00:37:02.129]  I mean, I don't even like the size of our federal government, let alone one world government.
[00:37:02.149 --> 00:37:03.990]  I want government to be local.
[00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:09.754]  I've tried to explain this in a chapter, the last chapter of... So there you go.
[00:37:11.267 --> 00:37:17.750]  Glenn Beck will say he's against the New World Order, but then he will support almost every policy of it.
[00:37:18.190 --> 00:37:20.512]  He will support the politicians that are pushing it.
[00:37:21.452 --> 00:37:27.415]  And then two weeks ago, he would say Ron Paul supporters are domestic enemies, and later he brings that up.
[00:37:29.756 --> 00:37:40.061]  So, there's Glenn Beck saying he's against all these things, but then saying the people that are fighting it are violent, and then later in the show he says, I'm getting threats by your listeners.
[00:37:41.946 --> 00:37:44.648]  I'm getting threats by your supporters.
[00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:49.332]  Well, any radio show, any TV show of any size is going to get threats.
[00:37:49.372 --> 00:37:50.572]  I mean, we get them every day.
[00:37:51.273 --> 00:37:52.334]  I'm going to kill you.
[00:37:52.474 --> 00:37:53.154]  I'm going to this.
[00:37:53.234 --> 00:37:53.695]  I'm going to that.
[00:37:54.836 --> 00:37:56.257]  And you know, most of those aren't serious.
[00:37:56.277 --> 00:37:57.317]  There's been a few that have been.
[00:37:57.918 --> 00:37:59.379]  But the point is, Beck knows that.
[00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:01.941]  And so he goes on air and he goes, your supporters.
[00:38:01.961 --> 00:38:04.883]  I mean, he could have even been one of Beck's people doing that for all we know.
[00:38:04.903 --> 00:38:10.127]  Kind of like black folks putting swastikas on their own dorms or Jews doing it.
[00:38:10.848 --> 00:38:17.312]  And nine times out of ten they end up catching it, and it is the very person claiming that this is being done to them that's doing it.
[00:38:18.433 --> 00:38:24.136]  So I would say Beck is one of the main people we should look at in all this.
[00:38:24.597 --> 00:38:29.620]  But Beck complains of threats, yet wanted to kill Michael Moore.
[00:38:32.642 --> 00:38:35.804]  This is from PrisonPlanet.com by Stephen Paul Watson yesterday.
[00:38:37.043 --> 00:38:40.245]  That complains of threats yet wanted to kill Michael Moore.
[00:38:40.285 --> 00:38:44.827]  This is what an incredible hypocrite this guy is.
[00:38:45.848 --> 00:38:53.432]  Ron Paul appeared on Glenn Beck's CNN show last night for a full hour in what was, it has to be said, a fair interview.
[00:38:54.224 --> 00:39:08.415]  Rare as that concept has been in the past, where Beck is concerned, however, Beck couldn't resist straying away from Paul's campaign issues towards the end of the interview in order to complain that he was receiving several death threats from people who claimed to support Paul.
[00:39:08.875 --> 00:39:10.617]  And by the way, I disagree with the Watsons.
[00:39:10.637 --> 00:39:11.677]  I don't think it was a fair interview.
[00:39:13.979 --> 00:39:17.342]  And again, I say that because he did some unfair things in there and
[00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:18.815]  That's what Beck does.
[00:39:18.835 --> 00:39:27.439]  He'll act real normal to get that huge audience that tuned in to get him hooked and then he'll be back to saying people that need to be arrested by next week.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:42.526]  The thinly veiled attack was clearly designed to suggest that Ron Paul's supporters are dangerous and that this reflects on his policies, a smear tactic Beck has previously used and one that most likely landed him with said threats in the first place.
[00:39:44.547 --> 00:39:46.188]  A bemused Ron Paul was of course
[00:39:47.268 --> 00:39:52.772]  According to condemning any threat of violence despite not having any knowledge of what Beck was referring to.
[00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:58.836]  However, now you notice Beck didn't come out two weeks ago and said he was getting threats.
[00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.798]  He talked about how people should be put in camps.
[00:40:01.398 --> 00:40:03.039]  He said we were with Islamofascists.
[00:40:03.079 --> 00:40:04.801]  He said we should have the military used on us.
[00:40:05.861 --> 00:40:06.822]  How we were violent.
[00:40:07.182 --> 00:40:11.485]  And then now he says he has emails that he's gotten since then proving what he said.
[00:40:12.226 --> 00:40:16.589]  Well, it's violent, Beck, to say we should be arrested or have the military used on us.
[00:40:17.185 --> 00:40:18.306]  You are a petty tyrant.
[00:40:18.846 --> 00:40:22.769]  Believe me, folks, Beck would wear a black uniform and be very happy to rule over all of us.
[00:40:23.410 --> 00:40:23.730]  Okay?
[00:40:25.171 --> 00:40:35.258]  But me and Ron Paul was... because, I mean, look, you get one of these mainline New World Order people on CNN or even Fox where they're out in the open, establishment, we just know they're the enemy.
[00:40:35.959 --> 00:40:40.702]  Beck is particularly evil because he cloaks and decloaks right in front of us.
[00:40:41.488 --> 00:40:48.054]  He puts on the sheep's clothing, and then poof, there's the wolf again, and then the sheep's clothing's back, and then poof, there's the wolf again.
[00:40:48.074 --> 00:40:49.936]  It's like a cloaking device.
[00:40:50.256 --> 00:40:51.097]  On and off, on and off.
[00:40:51.117 --> 00:40:53.600]  And I mean, he's like blinking like a Christmas tree light.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.481]  It's blinking so fast, like a pulsar.
[00:40:56.823 --> 00:41:01.307]  The muse Rob Hall was, of course, cornered into condemning any threat of violence.
[00:41:01.707 --> 00:41:02.648]  That's a lawyer tactic.
[00:41:02.688 --> 00:41:03.249]  I'd have gone back.
[00:41:03.289 --> 00:41:04.430]  Don't use that lawyer tactic.
[00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.671]  Everybody gets threats on the Internet.
[00:41:07.122 --> 00:41:28.284]  Despite not having any knowledge of what Beck was referring to, however, it is quite impossible to have any sympathy for Beck, given the fact that not only does he regularly regurgitate the kill those darn Islamos before they kill us mantra, but also personally threaten to kill people whose views he condemns, namely, those of filmmaker Michael Moore.
[00:41:28.911 --> 00:41:39.119]  Credit goes to Blogspot, Real Truth Hell Online, reporting out that on May 17, 2005, Beck on his radio show said the following, Hang on!
[00:41:39.399 --> 00:41:41.081]  Let me just tell you what I'm thinking.
[00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:43.343]  I'm thinking about killing Michael Moore.
[00:41:44.123 --> 00:41:48.967]  And I'm wondering if I could kill him myself, or if I would need to hire somebody to do it.
[00:41:49.067 --> 00:41:50.608]  No, I think I could.
[00:41:50.628 --> 00:41:56.253]  I think he could be looking me in the eye, you know, and I could just be choking
[00:41:57.006 --> 00:41:58.787]  The life out of him.
[00:41:58.927 --> 00:41:59.528]  Is that wrong?
[00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:05.532]  I stopped wearing my, what would Jesus band do, and I lost all sense of right and wrong now.
[00:42:05.972 --> 00:42:13.938]  I used to be able to say, yeah, I'd kill Michael Moore, and then I'd see that little band, what would Jesus do, and then I'd realize, oh no, you wouldn't want to kill Michael Moore.
[00:42:14.498 --> 00:42:18.901]  Or at least you wouldn't choke him to death, and you know, well, I'm not sure.
[00:42:20.142 --> 00:42:21.383]  By the way, we have the audio.
[00:42:22.304 --> 00:42:23.385]  People aren't going to believe that.
[00:42:23.445 --> 00:42:25.266]  Just go get the scumbag's audio, John.
[00:42:25.896 --> 00:42:26.817]  It's on Prison Planet.
[00:42:26.897 --> 00:42:30.319]  It's Beck Complains of Threats.
[00:42:30.359 --> 00:42:32.400]  You can find that.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.720]  It's still on the main page, my friend.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:34.381]  Thank you, John.
[00:42:34.981 --> 00:42:37.883]  We'll actually just play that for people because they won't believe it if we just read it.
[00:42:41.185 --> 00:42:50.530]  Imagine having Michael Medved say that I've heard twice, and I'm told it's a weekly occurrence, that I should be arrested, investigated, incarcerated, that I should be imprisoned.
[00:42:51.591 --> 00:42:52.491]  That guy's powerful.
[00:42:52.511 --> 00:42:53.952]  He's on like 300 radio stations.
[00:42:54.949 --> 00:42:56.571]  He's on some of the biggest stations in the country.
[00:42:57.652 --> 00:42:58.552]  Do you know what that's like?
[00:43:00.654 --> 00:43:03.897]  That he publicly goes to the White House and is given talking points.
[00:43:04.958 --> 00:43:09.202]  That he admittedly is an operative for the Republican Party.
[00:43:10.263 --> 00:43:11.204]  Do you know what that's like?
[00:43:12.365 --> 00:43:13.687]  And I know Medford's smart, folks.
[00:43:13.727 --> 00:43:15.008]  He knows what happened on 9-11.
[00:43:15.268 --> 00:43:15.849]  He's not stupid.
[00:43:16.229 --> 00:43:17.350]  He's cold-blooded.
[00:43:17.731 --> 00:43:18.151]  I've met him.
[00:43:19.665 --> 00:43:25.767]  And I walked over and I said, Mr. Medved, if you aren't seeing the big radio hall there, and he started yelling, it's Alex Jones!
[00:43:25.807 --> 00:43:27.228]  He thinks the President murders people!
[00:43:27.648 --> 00:43:28.308]  Secret Service!
[00:43:28.529 --> 00:43:29.209]  Secret Service!
[00:43:29.609 --> 00:43:33.651]  And I knew that I didn't want to get my credentials pulled because if Lord Medved said so, what happened?
[00:43:34.191 --> 00:43:37.812]  And as I walked away, he just nodded and said, during the break, he goes, that's right.
[00:43:38.352 --> 00:43:38.933]  That's right.
[00:43:38.973 --> 00:43:39.813]  You just run.
[00:43:39.833 --> 00:43:41.854]  And he knew he had the power.
[00:43:41.914 --> 00:43:43.495]  He knew his wickedness on Earth.
[00:43:43.995 --> 00:43:46.976]  He knew he's got the dark force of the New World Order behind him, and he knew.
[00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:49.376]  He knows.
[00:43:49.416 --> 00:43:50.576]  He's cunning and evil.
[00:43:51.757 --> 00:43:52.717]  So is Neil Bortz.
[00:43:53.197 --> 00:43:54.598]  They're all there to fool you.
[00:43:54.658 --> 00:44:01.240]  They know mainline America is libertarian, mainline America is conservative, mainline America wants truth and freedom and liberty.
[00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.481]  They know the left's all waking up and joining the ranks of the freedom lovers.
[00:44:07.241 --> 00:44:12.883]  They know huge exoduses of the right, despite what they've tried, are getting out of the political control paradigm.
[00:44:18.968 --> 00:44:19.428]  They know.
[00:44:20.909 --> 00:44:22.430]  And so they have these talking points.
[00:44:23.131 --> 00:44:31.215]  I mean, again, it chilled into my bones Saturday night to hear that Neil Bortz best of as I drove to the store, saying Alex Jones is like Tim McVeigh.
[00:44:31.756 --> 00:44:33.717]  Alex Jones is like Charlie Manson.
[00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:35.178]  Alex Jones is dangerous.
[00:44:39.621 --> 00:44:40.841]  I'm dangerous.
[00:44:41.161 --> 00:44:42.602]  I'm overthrowing the country.
[00:44:42.662 --> 00:44:44.363]  I'm undermining the nation.
[00:44:44.644 --> 00:44:46.385]  Like Glenn Beck said, these people are dangerous.
[00:44:46.805 --> 00:44:48.626]  On his radio show, he said, this is Alex Jones.
[00:44:49.494 --> 00:44:50.994]  Why do you interview him, George Norrie?
[00:44:51.614 --> 00:44:55.795]  Listen, you know, and they and that strata of upper echelon talk show hosts are chastising him.
[00:44:55.815 --> 00:44:57.355]  He's got to be commended for even having me on still.
[00:44:57.375 --> 00:44:58.536]  I'm surprised I'm on any anymore.
[00:44:59.876 --> 00:45:01.016]  They've attacked him nationally.
[00:45:01.076 --> 00:45:02.636]  I've seen Fox News attack Norrie over it.
[00:45:05.697 --> 00:45:07.617]  Alex Jones is dangerous.
[00:45:08.237 --> 00:45:09.297]  You bet I'm dangerous.
[00:45:09.397 --> 00:45:11.378]  I know your bosses are a bunch of murderers.
[00:45:12.878 --> 00:45:14.978]  And somebody's got to have the guts.
[00:45:16.539 --> 00:45:18.119]  But again, it isn't even guts with me.
[00:45:18.891 --> 00:45:20.471]  You find out they're a bunch of killers.
[00:45:21.011 --> 00:45:26.793]  You find out they've tested radiological, chemical, biological, thousands of times on us.
[00:45:27.633 --> 00:45:33.854]  You find all this stuff out, and you find out they think we're cattle, and you find out they're testing on us all the time.
[00:45:33.874 --> 00:45:38.255]  You find out they hate us all, whether you're in the military, the police, or an auto mechanic.
[00:45:38.935 --> 00:45:40.976]  You find out this ruling elite thinks they're God.
[00:45:42.616 --> 00:45:46.597]  I mean, what am I supposed to do?
[00:45:46.617 --> 00:45:47.817]  What am I supposed to do?
[00:45:49.278 --> 00:45:50.178]  I can't shut up.
[00:45:50.899 --> 00:45:51.779]  I'll never shut up.
[00:45:51.859 --> 00:45:55.340]  And now, I told Larry Pratt they were going to pass that gun bill.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:56.260]  You heard me on there.
[00:45:57.241 --> 00:45:59.442]  I told you we've never been in a greater threat than we are now.
[00:45:59.462 --> 00:46:00.362]  They're making their move.
[00:46:01.582 --> 00:46:02.523]  They're making their move.
[00:46:03.443 --> 00:46:07.744]  They didn't triple the size of the BATF and get them a building twice its size in D.C.
[00:46:08.345 --> 00:46:10.445]  that just opened last year to play TiddlyWinks.
[00:46:13.746 --> 00:46:17.988]  The Supreme Court's taken up gun restriction bill.
[00:46:18.942 --> 00:46:20.743]  And they're going to rule against the Second Amendment.
[00:46:20.903 --> 00:46:21.943]  Brace yourselves.
[00:46:22.703 --> 00:46:32.226]  I told you they were going to pass this latest legislation for total federal registration, control, banning about one-third of our military and one-third of our police from running firearms.
[00:46:34.206 --> 00:46:36.807]  They're going to try to selectively enforce and still let cops keep it.
[00:46:38.788 --> 00:46:39.708]  That's even in the bill.
[00:46:40.148 --> 00:46:43.649]  Republicans had that added in because law enforcement groups were freaking out.
[00:46:44.629 --> 00:46:46.410]  But it just shows you where this is going.
[00:46:50.993 --> 00:46:53.834]  And the article about it even says, oh, it's pro-gun.
[00:46:54.555 --> 00:46:56.396]  The Infernal NRA.
[00:46:57.476 --> 00:47:01.118]  Founded for gun control, by and for gun control.
[00:47:01.138 --> 00:47:06.701]  And you just can't get an NRA member to understand that.
[00:47:07.802 --> 00:47:12.564]  A lot of them have, and that's why they've lost over a million members, but you need to go join Gunners of America.
[00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:17.351]  You need to get involved in the Second Amendment fight.
[00:47:17.372 --> 00:47:19.093]  You need to form groups locally now.
[00:47:19.453 --> 00:47:20.133]  They're coming.
[00:47:20.234 --> 00:47:25.797]  I'm a watchman on the wall, and I'm telling you, I see a big army coming at us, like I've never seen before.
[00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:31.581]  All right, who's up first here?
[00:47:31.621 --> 00:47:32.722]  We'll start taking calls now.
[00:47:32.742 --> 00:47:34.323]  I've got a bunch of other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:47:35.484 --> 00:47:37.145]  Gordon in California, you're on the air.
[00:47:37.165 --> 00:47:39.067]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:40.027 --> 00:47:40.648]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:47:41.228 --> 00:47:41.689]  Very good.
[00:47:43.171 --> 00:47:45.893]  I wanted to talk about vaccines and also Ron Paul.
[00:47:47.473 --> 00:47:55.098]  I noticed that they're trying to attack Ron Paul about him accepting a $500 donation from a white supremacist.
[00:47:56.799 --> 00:47:57.799]  Yeah, Don Black.
[00:47:58.159 --> 00:47:58.640]  So what?
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:00.401]  Exactly, so what?
[00:48:00.481 --> 00:48:03.082]  But, you know, it's just a headline that catches your attention.
[00:48:03.582 --> 00:48:04.903]  I think it's pathetic, all the attacks.
[00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:09.826]  I mean, if it was a Chinese communist general running death camps, he could give a million.
[00:48:10.729 --> 00:48:13.631]  I mean, Ron Paul said he doesn't agree with Mr. Black's views.
[00:48:15.152 --> 00:48:18.234]  And he's not going to get in the business of nitpicking.
[00:48:18.554 --> 00:48:20.215]  They told him, send my donation back.
[00:48:20.775 --> 00:48:21.616]  And he hasn't done it.
[00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:24.618]  And Ron Paul says, hey, I'm going to use this money for what I want.
[00:48:25.218 --> 00:48:30.361]  People who don't agree with Mr. Black's views, I don't, should be happy he gave the money.
[00:48:31.042 --> 00:48:34.144]  Yeah, the fact that it's a news story just shows how weak their arguments are.
[00:48:34.184 --> 00:48:35.484]  By the way, that's an old story.
[00:48:35.504 --> 00:48:36.525]  That's been out for two months.
[00:48:36.605 --> 00:48:39.467]  But now, I put Ron Paul into Google.
[00:48:40.552 --> 00:48:42.574]  This morning, and there were hundreds.
[00:48:42.634 --> 00:48:43.495]  In fact, I can do it right now.
[00:48:43.575 --> 00:48:47.798]  I think it was 179 mainstream stories with that headline.
[00:48:48.239 --> 00:48:50.160]  So that's a big push right now.
[00:48:50.641 --> 00:48:54.824]  But they know the general idiot public, the same ones that think the NRA isn't a gun control group.
[00:48:55.344 --> 00:48:58.567]  So they just can't... They'll hear that, and, oh, he's with a white supremacist.
[00:48:58.827 --> 00:49:00.609]  He was with a gold heist.
[00:49:01.009 --> 00:49:03.211]  He was with a... That's what they do.
[00:49:04.872 --> 00:49:07.815]  And then another thing, I went to Safeway to check out their flu vaccines.
[00:49:08.462 --> 00:49:08.582]  That's
[00:49:27.327 --> 00:49:28.507]  Isn't mercury bad for you?
[00:49:28.527 --> 00:49:31.188]  And she said, no, it's fine, you know, as long as you're not allergic to it.
[00:49:31.208 --> 00:49:45.693]  But every week, knowingly, Dr. Dean Adele, nationwide, every, because I listen every week, because I'm driving in Sunday when he's rebroadcasting locally, and the last few weeks, like the last five weeks, every week, he just announces there is no mercury in vaccines.
[00:49:45.753 --> 00:49:46.993]  It's an insane conspiracy.
[00:49:47.533 --> 00:49:49.754]  It's not, now he knows as a medical doctor,
[00:49:50.496 --> 00:50:00.142]  In all the vaccines, in fact, the AP reported two years ago that they quadrupled, on average, actually five times.
[00:50:00.622 --> 00:50:01.642]  What would five times be?
[00:50:05.104 --> 00:50:06.405]  Five times the level.
[00:50:06.425 --> 00:50:07.726]  They just said, oh, you don't like it?
[00:50:07.786 --> 00:50:09.147]  How about five times?
[00:50:10.828 --> 00:50:11.568]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:12.509 --> 00:50:17.411]  Well, yeah, I mean, they also said, well, you know, if you have a young child or if you're an old person, you're worried about this.
[00:50:17.491 --> 00:50:18.452]  We do have vaccines
[00:50:18.985 --> 00:50:20.286]  Especially made without the mercury.
[00:50:20.346 --> 00:50:21.567]  I think you have to pay extra for it.
[00:50:21.587 --> 00:50:22.688]  Yeah, that's what I've always said.
[00:50:23.048 --> 00:50:29.493]  See, when they say there's no more mercury vaccines, they make small lots by federal regulation.
[00:50:29.794 --> 00:50:36.399]  That's what they changed six years ago, where you can send off for them and pay on average three times as much and get them.
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:38.721]  Anything else?
[00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:41.984]  No, she just said it's fine if you're not allergic to mercury.
[00:50:42.004 --> 00:50:42.624]  I thought, what?
[00:50:42.664 --> 00:50:43.365]  I'm not allergic.
[00:50:44.626 --> 00:50:45.266]  Allergic?
[00:50:45.626 --> 00:50:46.007]  Stay there.
[00:50:46.027 --> 00:50:46.847]  I want to hear more about this.
[00:50:46.968 --> 00:50:47.448]  Allergic?
[00:50:48.129 --> 00:50:59.298]  That's like, if you're not allergic to being shot in the head with a .45 hollow point, then go ahead and shoot yourself in the head with a .45 hollow point if you're not allergic.
[00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:03.341]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:03.361 --> 00:51:05.463]  A new world order.
[00:51:06.183 --> 00:51:10.426]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:12.848]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:51:13.909 --> 00:51:16.071]  Both their objective being world domination.
[00:51:16.676 --> 00:51:19.100]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:19.862 --> 00:51:27.194]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:35.203]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:35.663 --> 00:51:39.125]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:39.525 --> 00:51:42.026]  Bill of Rights is making great progress for the world government.
[00:51:42.066 --> 00:51:43.247]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:44.027]  They're not after money.
[00:51:44.047 --> 00:51:45.088]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:45.308 --> 00:51:46.048]  They're after power.
[00:51:46.289 --> 00:51:47.129]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:55.773 --> 00:51:56.634]  Endgame.
[00:51:56.934 --> 00:51:58.595]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:51:58.955 --> 00:52:00.115]  You have been warned.
[00:52:02.756 --> 00:52:07.277]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.617 --> 00:52:11.698]  You asked us to make a water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:11.998 --> 00:52:12.558]  We listened.
[00:52:12.858 --> 00:52:17.839]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.119 --> 00:52:18.599]  We listened.
[00:52:18.979 --> 00:52:22.020]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:22.960]  We listened.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:27.504]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:27.885 --> 00:52:28.365]  We listened.
[00:52:28.725 --> 00:52:33.951]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.371 --> 00:52:35.732]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:36.093 --> 00:52:37.674]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:37.874 --> 00:52:43.420]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:46.502]  Get the Berkey Light, the American Water Purifier.

[00:53:00.211 --> 00:53:03.134]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:53:03.294 --> 00:53:08.519]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:53:08.839 --> 00:53:14.144]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:53:14.524 --> 00:53:15.665]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:16.026 --> 00:53:24.994]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:53:25.334 --> 00:53:26.954]  Now compare Calvin Pure Soap.

[00:54:25.745 --> 00:54:30.311]  You know, let me just tell you what I'm thinking.
[00:54:30.531 --> 00:54:31.933]  I'm thinking about killing Michael Moore.
[00:54:32.573 --> 00:54:38.741]  And I'm wondering if I could kill him myself or if I would need to hire somebody to do it.
[00:54:39.141 --> 00:54:39.822]  I think I could.
[00:54:39.842 --> 00:54:41.905]  I think he could be looking me in the eye.
[00:54:42.405 --> 00:54:42.726]  You know?
[00:54:43.046 --> 00:54:44.448]  And I could just be choking the life out of him.
[00:54:44.748 --> 00:54:45.309]  Is this wrong?
[00:54:46.443 --> 00:54:51.166]  I stopped wearing my What Would Jesus Band do, and I've lost the old sense of right and wrong now.
[00:54:51.467 --> 00:54:56.010]  I used to be able to say, yeah, I'd kill Michael Moore, and then I'd see the little band, What Would Jesus Do?
[00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.431]  And then I'd realize, oh, he wouldn't kill Michael Moore.
[00:54:58.812 --> 00:55:01.153]  At least he wouldn't choke him to death, and, you know.
[00:55:01.453 --> 00:55:02.994]  Well, I'm not sure.
[00:55:06.577 --> 00:55:13.842]  Now even if you hate Michael Moore, and I've confronted him about covering up 9-11's, saying it was just an accident,
[00:55:14.645 --> 00:55:19.730]  But the government was just idiots instead of carrying out the attacks, but I wouldn't call for killing.
[00:55:23.373 --> 00:55:33.863]  And these talk show hosts, Neil Bortz, Michael Medved, it is my wish that if anybody ever does shoot and kill me, one of these nuts and they're out there, that they be questioned.
[00:55:34.003 --> 00:55:35.264]  The cops will try to cover it up.
[00:55:36.167 --> 00:55:38.548]  And there's a good chance they would have heard about this.
[00:55:38.608 --> 00:55:41.130]  It'll be some mainline right-wing lunatic.
[00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:46.572]  I want to make sure that these guys are all sued for it.
[00:55:48.053 --> 00:55:54.797]  And if Michael Moore ever gets blown away, it'll probably be Glenn Beck calling for it over and over again on his radio show.
[00:55:55.997 --> 00:55:59.579]  Yeah, go on the air, talk to 15 million people, and tell them a bunch of times.
[00:55:59.619 --> 00:56:01.160]  He did it a bunch of times, by the way.
[00:56:01.798 --> 00:56:07.581]  To go kill Michael Moore, how great it would be to kill Michael Moore, fantasizing about killing Michael Moore.
[00:56:07.601 --> 00:56:15.704]  And then he gets up on TV and says that Ron Paul supporters are terrorists and are dangerous and need to have the military used against us.
[00:56:18.906 --> 00:56:24.268]  Bob and Richard and everybody else, I'm going to move quicker to your calls now, but going back to Gordon in California.
[00:56:25.137 --> 00:56:28.540]  Yeah, mercury is deadly poison to your tissues and your brain.
[00:56:28.961 --> 00:56:30.882]  You don't need to, quote, be allergic to it.
[00:56:30.922 --> 00:56:33.464]  It's not like it's daisies or something.
[00:56:33.825 --> 00:56:34.205]  Gordon?
[00:56:35.266 --> 00:56:36.727]  Yeah, and how would you know you're allergic?
[00:56:36.767 --> 00:56:38.389]  I mean, that's the question she was asking me.
[00:56:38.429 --> 00:56:41.692]  Well, you know, if you're allergic, we have these other options for you.
[00:56:42.672 --> 00:56:44.114]  But, I mean,
[00:56:45.347 --> 00:56:46.488]  Is it like lead?
[00:56:46.708 --> 00:56:50.870]  Are some people allergic to lead and others, you know, they can take small amounts?
[00:56:51.930 --> 00:56:58.393]  Well, in a sick way, there's a ribbon of truth, kind of a little edge of truth to it.
[00:56:59.114 --> 00:57:06.197]  Men, males have, on average, more violent responses to mercury than females.
[00:57:06.954 --> 00:57:08.075]  But it's bad for everybody.
[00:57:08.135 --> 00:57:08.715]  Very deadly.
[00:57:09.396 --> 00:57:10.977]  And it's just absolute baloney.
[00:57:11.417 --> 00:57:14.419]  But, I mean, at least you didn't say like CBS News says.
[00:57:14.959 --> 00:57:17.281]  Have you ever heard the clip where they say mercury is good for your brain?
[00:57:17.301 --> 00:57:19.822]  No.
[00:57:20.163 --> 00:57:24.065]  Now, do you believe me that CBS News Nationwide reported that?
[00:57:24.725 --> 00:57:25.686]  No, that's hard to believe.
[00:57:25.746 --> 00:57:26.687]  Okay, pull it up.
[00:57:26.787 --> 00:57:27.547]  Pull it up, John.
[00:57:27.707 --> 00:57:28.088]  Pull it up.
[00:57:28.588 --> 00:57:30.749]  I've heard you're not supposed to eat tuna because there's mercury.
[00:57:30.849 --> 00:57:32.370]  Well, that doesn't matter now, sir.
[00:57:32.891 --> 00:57:36.393]  I have an MSNBC report saying lead in toys is good for children.
[00:57:37.891 --> 00:57:39.492]  You know what, we're going to play both of them and queue them up.
[00:57:39.552 --> 00:57:40.153]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:40.933 --> 00:57:43.015]  When we start the next hour, I'll play those.
[00:57:43.355 --> 00:57:44.196]  I know you don't believe it.
[00:57:44.296 --> 00:57:45.056]  I don't believe it either.
[00:57:45.616 --> 00:57:47.878]  But let me tell you, they told people lead was good for children?
[00:57:47.898 --> 00:57:48.619]  They believe it now.
[00:57:49.939 --> 00:57:53.742]  And they tell the general public that mercury is good for your brain and part of the nutritious breakfast?
[00:57:54.723 --> 00:57:57.044]  They'll go out and start taking mercury pills.
[00:57:57.945 --> 00:57:59.706]  These people don't play games, okay?
[00:58:00.186 --> 00:58:02.428]  The generals, a certain segment of the public,
[00:58:04.088 --> 00:58:08.511]  The government could pour a glass of cyanide in front of them and say, that is cyanide.
[00:58:08.571 --> 00:58:09.332]  It is nutritious.
[00:58:09.372 --> 00:58:09.672]  Drink it.
[00:58:09.872 --> 00:58:11.894]  And they would say, oh, absolutely, government.
[00:58:12.394 --> 00:58:14.676]  Oh, I love it.
[00:58:15.476 --> 00:58:17.858]  I mean, hell, they think the NRA is a pro-gun group.
[00:58:18.178 --> 00:58:19.620]  They're the father of gun control.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:21.061]  Literally.
[00:58:21.181 --> 00:58:21.741]  Literally.
[00:58:22.582 --> 00:58:23.863]  I don't believe anything.
[00:58:24.847 --> 00:58:29.870]  Imagine the big gun control group, and you give your money to them, and they lobby for gun control.
[00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.851]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:58:32.631 --> 00:58:35.113]  Oh, it's driving me insane!
[00:58:36.613 --> 00:58:38.474]  Back to the second hour.
[00:58:43.177 --> 00:58:45.278]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:45.798 --> 00:58:48.980]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:57.947 --> 00:59:02.129]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.769 --> 00:59:03.610]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:05.271]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.931 --> 00:59:09.693]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.113 --> 00:59:14.235]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.035 --> 00:59:26.941]  We've probably played this clip 30 plus times in the last four years or so.
[00:59:28.001 --> 00:59:31.203]  And John just went and got the computer, and it's been corrupted.
[00:59:33.644 --> 00:59:36.405]  But luckily, it's online, so we're finding it again.
[00:59:36.966 --> 00:59:46.191]  It's local CBS News, but it was a national news feed, and this aired all over the country, where they said Mercury, the new study show, is good for your brain.
[00:59:47.791 --> 00:59:49.472]  Of course, the study didn't really say that.
[00:59:50.033 --> 00:59:51.173]  It doesn't matter to these people.
[00:59:51.833 --> 00:59:54.615]  And there was one a few months ago where MSNBC was saying that
[00:59:56.081 --> 01:00:00.183]  Poison food and lead paint on toys was good for America?
[01:00:02.443 --> 01:00:03.784]  He's trying to find that right now.
[01:00:04.444 --> 01:00:07.465]  Because I know if we can't play it for you, you're not going to believe us.
[01:00:07.665 --> 01:00:08.286]  Who would believe it?
[01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:12.567]  But Murphy's Law is both those clips have been corrupted.
[01:00:13.428 --> 01:00:15.528]  Out of thousands on the computer, it's those clips.
[01:00:16.809 --> 01:00:21.871]  Shalob V. Bob in Florida, then we'll go to Richard and many others.
[01:00:21.911 --> 01:00:22.491]  Go ahead, Bob.
[01:00:25.154 --> 01:00:25.474]  Hello!
[01:00:25.775 --> 01:00:26.195]  Hello!
[01:00:26.215 --> 01:00:28.317]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:00:28.417 --> 01:00:28.777]  Good, sir.
[01:00:29.558 --> 01:00:30.939]  I'm glad to meet you.
[01:00:30.959 --> 01:00:31.360]  Thank God.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.784]  I've actually just came across you for the first time like a month ago.
[01:00:35.804 --> 01:00:42.530]  And it's I got your name and your website from a guy out of Canada.
[01:00:43.471 --> 01:00:50.998]  And I've been putting together a website for the past two years on all this information and really never kind of came across your information.
[01:00:52.011 --> 01:01:01.377]  But, and it's funny, you know, again I was listening to you the other day, and was hearing how you were saying you felt like you were unappreciated and alone, and I tell you, you're not.
[01:01:02.217 --> 01:01:02.937]  You're not at all.
[01:01:04.078 --> 01:01:15.685]  Well, I mean I've been under the weather so that tends to lean towards dark thoughts, but at the same time, I know I'm not alone with the listeners or individuals out there, but
[01:01:16.858 --> 01:01:17.498]  You're right.
[01:01:17.518 --> 01:01:18.299]  You're right.
[01:01:18.319 --> 01:01:19.859]  I talk to people about it all the time.
[01:01:19.879 --> 01:01:20.540]  They just do not get it.
[01:01:44.508 --> 01:01:45.208]  I know, I know.
[01:01:45.308 --> 01:01:49.910]  And you know, what we really need to do is duplicate you times a million to get this word out.
[01:01:51.151 --> 01:01:54.212]  I mean, so many people... A million toad-like creatures!
[01:01:55.073 --> 01:01:55.933]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:56.874 --> 01:01:57.414]  Imagine that.
[01:01:57.454 --> 01:01:58.674]  Imagine you everywhere.
[01:02:01.356 --> 01:02:02.636]  But it would make a big impact.
[01:02:02.696 --> 01:02:04.597]  And people, when they hear it, they think you're nuts.
[01:02:05.077 --> 01:02:07.258]  But when they see it, the whole attitude changes.
[01:02:08.499 --> 01:02:09.379]  And that's the thing.
[01:02:09.399 --> 01:02:12.801]  There's so many people that are blinded to what's really going on out there
[01:02:13.359 --> 01:02:23.685]  That it's, you know, even me, I mean, you know, after 9-11, I paid real close attention, but when I came across these theories, I thought it was impossible.
[01:02:23.866 --> 01:02:25.667]  Not in the United States, not in America.
[01:02:25.907 --> 01:02:26.627]  It's impossible.
[01:02:27.087 --> 01:02:30.049]  Until I woke up and I looked at the evidence.
[01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:34.752]  And just, you know, you can't dispute what you see.
[01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:38.535]  It's basic common sense in most of the stuff that's out there.
[01:02:38.915 --> 01:02:40.856]  But it's stuff you'll never see on the television.
[01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:42.490]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:02:42.530 --> 01:02:43.490]  I appreciate your call.
[01:02:44.051 --> 01:03:09.197]  You know, the big thing I see as the greatest threat facing us is the unchecked, out-of-control genetic engineering that's going on, the cross-species splicing of plant-animal together, the admissions that it's giving rise to superviruses and superbacteria that are already among us.
[01:03:10.450 --> 01:03:16.455]  And you look at all the bad spin-off side effects of things that were primitive, like antibiotics.
[01:03:19.437 --> 01:03:20.638]  Or things along those lines.
[01:03:21.479 --> 01:03:24.822]  And then you start trying to magnify what it's going to do.
[01:03:27.224 --> 01:03:28.905]  All the things they're engaging in.
[01:03:32.348 --> 01:03:34.029]  The world really is out of control.
[01:03:34.049 --> 01:03:36.191]  The globalists control the world financial system.
[01:03:36.211 --> 01:03:37.192]  They think they're in control.
[01:03:38.183 --> 01:03:44.846]  When you really get down to brass tacks with what they're doing, they are out of control.
[01:03:46.187 --> 01:03:46.807]  Out of control.
[01:03:48.248 --> 01:03:53.010]  But don't worry, they're going to have a checkpoint to search your car to make sure your driver's license is in order.
[01:03:54.151 --> 01:03:55.551]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:55.571 --> 01:03:57.672]  A new world order.
[01:03:58.393 --> 01:04:02.655]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a power of governments.
[01:04:03.283 --> 01:04:05.024]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[01:04:05.044 --> 01:04:08.346]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[01:04:08.906 --> 01:04:11.367]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:12.088 --> 01:04:19.412]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:22.432 --> 01:04:27.435]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:27.896 --> 01:04:31.358]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:31.758 --> 01:04:34.280]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.461]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:35.481 --> 01:04:36.261]  They're not after money.
[01:04:36.281 --> 01:04:37.342]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:37.562 --> 01:04:38.283]  They're after power.
[01:04:38.523 --> 01:04:39.564]  That's what they're after.

[01:05:49.326 --> 01:05:51.947]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.869]  Terrorism!
[01:05:54.009 --> 01:05:54.770]  Terrorism!
[01:05:54.870 --> 01:06:00.933]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallouts, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:06:01.193 --> 01:06:02.774]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:06:03.034 --> 01:06:05.515]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:05.895 --> 01:06:20.463]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:06:20.503 --> 01:06:20.823]  government.
[01:06:21.003 --> 01:06:22.704]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:29.068]  Yes, it's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:06:29.208 --> 01:06:33.711]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.040]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.681 --> 01:07:00.761]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.442 --> 01:07:02.562]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.203 --> 01:07:04.023]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.784 --> 01:07:05.664]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.684 --> 01:07:10.167]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:14.670]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.093 --> 01:07:21.654]  Okay, here is a clip.
[01:07:24.159 --> 01:07:33.542]  I don't know why I get into this detail, but most of the stuff you see on local ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX, local affiliates, they're pre-packaged.
[01:07:33.582 --> 01:07:34.862]  The video's pre-packaged.
[01:07:35.323 --> 01:07:37.103]  The teleprompter text is pre-packaged.
[01:07:38.324 --> 01:07:40.864]  It's important to understand this was a national program.
[01:07:42.245 --> 01:07:48.967]  But they had the local anchors read off the teleprompter as the video played.
[01:07:50.687 --> 01:07:52.348]  Fred Cantu and Sheila Mathers.
[01:07:54.466 --> 01:07:59.928]  And I googled this three or four years ago, the headline, and found it in every CBS affiliate in the country.
[01:08:02.249 --> 01:08:08.612]  So a lot of times you think it's the local anchors you quote trust, because Americans don't trust national anchors, but they tend to trust locals.
[01:08:09.292 --> 01:08:10.973]  Those locals are like puppets, folks.
[01:08:10.993 --> 01:08:17.215]  They're just repeating what was put in their mouth about half the time, and almost always if it's a national story.
[01:08:18.101 --> 01:08:20.863]  Again, why can't locals report on national stories from their own position?
[01:08:21.204 --> 01:08:23.205]  Because they might do a story about mercury being bad.
[01:08:23.545 --> 01:08:32.512]  But if it's all the medical stuff is handed down from CBS Broadcast Center, literally founded by the Central Intelligence Agency, you're going to have control.
[01:08:32.572 --> 01:08:33.973]  So, listen carefully.
[01:08:34.013 --> 01:08:38.437]  They say, mercury-containing vaccines help your brain.
[01:08:40.106 --> 01:08:42.549]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:46.134]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[01:08:46.735 --> 01:08:48.798]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses?
[01:08:48.898 --> 01:08:51.522]  A new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[01:08:57.632 --> 01:09:03.614]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[01:09:04.074 --> 01:09:10.517]  There have been warrants by concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[01:09:10.977 --> 01:09:17.940]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[01:09:20.341 --> 01:09:22.702]  Okay, now here is a more recent one.
[01:09:22.722 --> 01:09:23.742]  There's a whole bunch of these.
[01:09:24.733 --> 01:09:31.447]  Here's a more recent one about how poison in food and lead in toys is good for America and how dare you criticize it?
[01:09:32.099 --> 01:09:38.063]  About inflation, that's another interesting point because a lot of people like to say, uh, scaremonger about China, right?
[01:09:38.083 --> 01:09:40.685]  A lot of politicians, and I know you talk about that issue all the time.
[01:09:41.025 --> 01:09:43.026]  I think people should be careful what they wish for on China.
[01:09:43.046 --> 01:09:51.872]  You know, if China were to revalue its currency, or if China is to start making, say, toys that don't have lead in them, or food that isn't poisonous, their costs of production are going to go up.
[01:09:51.932 --> 01:09:55.434]  And that means prices at Walmart here in the United States are going to go up too.
[01:09:55.534 --> 01:09:58.056]  So, I would say China is our greatest friend right now.
[01:09:58.076 --> 01:10:01.078]  They're keeping prices low, and they're keeping prices for mortgages low too.
[01:10:02.745 --> 01:10:14.308]  And then they responded, and you can watch the longer clip online on MSNBC, that was the CNBC financial contributor, that lady works for CNBC, and they respond to her like that was a normal statement.
[01:10:14.328 --> 01:10:16.689]  And by the way, she was told to say that.
[01:10:16.769 --> 01:10:18.489]  See, they're testing now.
[01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:22.210]  They're testing with the absurd right now.
[01:10:23.191 --> 01:10:32.033]  And a lot of the public are going, hey, torture's good, secret arrest is good, no more warrants are good, lead is good, mercury is good.
[01:10:33.072 --> 01:10:34.332]  Open borders are good.
[01:10:35.152 --> 01:10:37.593]  And so they've just, I mean, it's like Fox News.
[01:10:38.213 --> 01:10:49.616]  I've been sent clips we can't even play here now on their overnight show where they're talking about all forms of disgusting, I mean, things I can't even mention here on air.
[01:10:49.816 --> 01:10:51.796]  And it's all sex.
[01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:56.377]  And it's for all these poor people with Alzheimer's, literally getting Alzheimer's, who are just watching that.
[01:10:56.897 --> 01:10:58.618]  So they get to shake their heads at all of it.
[01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:00.298]  It's all programming.
[01:11:02.028 --> 01:11:02.888]  And they're just doing it.
[01:11:04.049 --> 01:11:08.070]  And then they have morning shows where they say, torture people to death, it's good, ha ha ha.
[01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:10.311]  I mean, folks, that's about you.
[01:11:10.911 --> 01:11:20.154]  See, as soon as you accept that, you know, the old-fashioned fuddy-duddies who built this country could march up a hill and all of them get killed, but just a couple.
[01:11:20.835 --> 01:11:29.698]  Or they could drag through the snow giant guns off a mountaintop they took and literally walk 20 miles a day through the snow, leaving a bloody track behind them.
[01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:30.398]  You can't do that.
[01:11:31.061 --> 01:11:35.382]  But they get real freaked out and upset over somebody saying they were going to spy on them.
[01:11:35.422 --> 01:11:39.883]  They get real freaked out and upset over somebody telling them Mercury was good for them.
[01:11:40.263 --> 01:11:43.144]  They get real freaked out and upset over somebody coming after their guns.
[01:11:44.204 --> 01:11:45.985]  And you tell them, oh, just be reasonable.
[01:11:46.365 --> 01:11:49.746]  All these neocons that are always pushing and losing our rights.
[01:11:49.766 --> 01:11:51.046]  Oh, it's no big deal.
[01:11:51.066 --> 01:11:52.306]  We're not losing any of our freedoms.
[01:11:52.386 --> 01:11:52.866]  Oh, come on.
[01:11:52.907 --> 01:11:53.607]  It's reasonable.
[01:11:53.987 --> 01:11:55.127]  You haven't lost all your rights.
[01:11:55.167 --> 01:11:55.587]  Come on.
[01:11:57.448 --> 01:11:58.688]  See, it's always that attitude.
[01:12:01.798 --> 01:12:02.859]  Bob in Florida.
[01:12:07.061 --> 01:12:07.801]  Bob in Florida.
[01:12:07.821 --> 01:12:08.341]  You're on the air.
[01:12:08.361 --> 01:12:08.722]  Go ahead.
[01:12:09.222 --> 01:12:09.702]  Hey, Alex.
[01:12:09.762 --> 01:12:10.322]  It's Bob again.
[01:12:10.342 --> 01:12:10.783]  How you doing?
[01:12:11.023 --> 01:12:11.283]  Good.
[01:12:11.363 --> 01:12:11.883]  What's on your mind?
[01:12:12.383 --> 01:12:16.105]  So, one of the questions I had for you was, how did you get into this?
[01:12:16.145 --> 01:12:17.946]  How did you stumble across all this information?
[01:12:18.006 --> 01:12:19.107]  Obviously, you've been doing it a long time.
[01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:20.267]  What do you mean, Bob, again?
[01:12:20.287 --> 01:12:21.128]  Were you still on hold?
[01:12:22.054 --> 01:12:23.035]  I was talking to you.
[01:12:23.395 --> 01:12:24.476]  I'm going to let you go, sir.
[01:12:24.937 --> 01:12:27.439]  I don't control hanging up on the phone calls.
[01:12:27.959 --> 01:12:28.800]  I'm down here in Texas.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:29.641]  They're up in Minnesota.
[01:12:29.941 --> 01:12:31.302]  It's like doing a remote every day.
[01:12:32.103 --> 01:12:32.984]  I'm not mad at you.
[01:12:33.064 --> 01:12:34.065]  I'm just really sick.
[01:12:34.245 --> 01:12:36.287]  I've got a really bad headache and fever.
[01:12:36.307 --> 01:12:37.988]  I just can't handle it.
[01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:40.190]  I thought I'd already been to that caller.
[01:12:42.032 --> 01:12:43.013]  How did I get into this?
[01:12:44.113 --> 01:12:44.814]  Here's another thing.
[01:12:46.115 --> 01:12:47.837]  I've got to do a Frequently Asked Questions.
[01:12:48.567 --> 01:12:52.829]  On InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, because I probably get that five, ten times a week.
[01:12:55.731 --> 01:12:58.632]  And things you get asked over and over again become pet peeves.
[01:12:59.993 --> 01:13:06.416]  But... I mean, who cares how I got involved, you know?
[01:13:10.658 --> 01:13:12.799]  Anyways, I probably shouldn't even be on the air today, folks.
[01:13:13.239 --> 01:13:14.340]  Sorry if I'm sounding rude.
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.501]  I just, I really get sick of telling that story.
[01:13:17.836 --> 01:13:19.337]  Richard in Denver, you're on the air.
[01:13:19.878 --> 01:13:22.761]  Hey Alex, I probably shouldn't be on the air either.
[01:13:23.261 --> 01:13:26.084]  I got the sinus thing happening to me too.
[01:13:26.785 --> 01:13:33.872]  I wanted to, on that note, recommend chopping up some lemons and putting them in boiling water.
[01:13:34.573 --> 01:13:39.358]  Throw a towel over it and inhale those vapors because it will clear out the sinus stuff.
[01:13:40.496 --> 01:13:43.359]  Um, that's just a homeopathic remedy.
[01:13:43.719 --> 01:13:48.183]  I know there's no big drug involved or anything, but it actually works really well.
[01:13:48.443 --> 01:13:48.623]  Yeah.
[01:13:49.184 --> 01:13:55.249]  Um, listen, uh, you know, those guys that say that, uh, that, you know, we aren't losing all our rights.
[01:13:55.329 --> 01:13:56.410]  We still have our rights.
[01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:58.832]  Well, they're partially correct.
[01:13:58.892 --> 01:14:00.433]  We still have the third amendment.
[01:14:00.613 --> 01:14:04.857]  And, and so no soldier can come and stay in my house by God.
[01:14:05.966 --> 01:14:07.047]  And that's still in effect.
[01:14:07.087 --> 01:14:08.448]  Actually, that's not the case.
[01:14:08.528 --> 01:14:16.933]  In New Orleans and surrounding areas, if you watch Marine Corps training drills, which are here in the U.S., they make a point of training to take over people's homes and kick you out.
[01:14:18.963 --> 01:14:19.504]  Amazing.
[01:14:19.684 --> 01:14:20.404]  I can't believe it.
[01:14:20.444 --> 01:14:21.745]  So the third is gone, too.
[01:14:21.805 --> 01:14:22.625]  That's incredible.
[01:14:22.746 --> 01:14:27.709]  Well, they specifically train, the government trains to attack and overturn the Bill of Rights.
[01:14:27.749 --> 01:14:28.629]  That's their main enemy.
[01:14:29.250 --> 01:14:30.750]  NORTHCOM and the U.S.
[01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:32.912]  military's main enemy is the American people.
[01:14:33.212 --> 01:14:38.075]  Well, I'm sitting here looking at the amendments and, you know, I went through all of them.
[01:14:38.135 --> 01:14:42.758]  I know that the Fifth Amendment due process went out during the War on Drugs when they started
[01:14:43.371 --> 01:14:47.616]  Seizing people's property without any trials whatsoever.
[01:14:47.636 --> 01:14:49.358]  Yeah, no judge, no jury.
[01:14:49.698 --> 01:14:57.867]  And then it came out, the Dallas Police Department thousands of times would just pull over a nice car, throw a bag of chalk in the back, and they would just take it.
[01:14:58.067 --> 01:14:59.989]  And the officers were living in $3 million homes.
[01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:01.111]  It's a great new system.
[01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.172]  And they give it to the locals.
[01:15:03.192 --> 01:15:03.952]  Take Seattle.
[01:15:03.992 --> 01:15:04.652]  Take Seattle.
[01:15:05.132 --> 01:15:08.313]  In the finest area of town, more than half the bars are owned by cops.
[01:15:08.753 --> 01:15:11.054]  Because the cops will sell each other crack.
[01:15:11.434 --> 01:15:12.654]  Now, they don't even sell it to someone.
[01:15:12.694 --> 01:15:15.775]  And then they take the bar, and then the cops own it themselves.
[01:15:15.795 --> 01:15:16.255]  But go ahead.
[01:15:16.635 --> 01:15:17.816]  Well, there it is.
[01:15:17.896 --> 01:15:18.776]  That's exactly it.
[01:15:18.856 --> 01:15:21.397]  And now they're doing it on prostitution.
[01:15:21.477 --> 01:15:26.658]  I mean, they've expanded that to where if you get caught doing any number of crimes, they'll take your car.
[01:15:27.258 --> 01:15:28.679]  And it goes on and on.
[01:15:29.839 --> 01:15:41.905]  You know, just listening to you, I had a couple of other quick things, you know, about the mercury and about people saying, well, genetically modified organisms are not a problem, this is good for us.
[01:15:41.945 --> 01:15:45.687]  You know, Monsanto keeps telling us this, and those are the people that gave us
[01:15:47.968 --> 01:15:48.389]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:05.703 --> 01:16:13.025]  Well, I don't have time to keep up on all of it, but I do want you to know something, and maybe this will hearten you a little bit, Alex.
[01:16:13.205 --> 01:16:20.187]  I'm going out to buy my first shotgun for myself and one for my son today.
[01:16:20.687 --> 01:16:31.190]  Even though I'm not feeling well, I'm going to go out and, you know, I'm one of these old liberal, you know, anti-gun types from a long time.
[01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:40.855]  You know, I kind of subscribe to Einstein's philosophy that you can't simultaneously prepare for war and promote peace.
[01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:46.097]  I understand, but this is a phenomenon of liberals going out and arming themselves.
[01:16:46.298 --> 01:16:54.402]  Well, my son pointed out to me, and quite rightly so, that it is my duty as a citizen
[01:16:54.932 --> 01:16:55.553]  To be armed.
[01:16:56.514 --> 01:17:01.919]  It's not because I'm worried about somebody breaking into my house or anything like that.
[01:17:02.519 --> 01:17:08.625]  It's because it's my duty as a citizen of the United States of America to have a weapon.
[01:17:09.086 --> 01:17:12.109]  And so I'm going to do this as a civic duty.
[01:17:12.689 --> 01:17:18.275]  And it is a message to my government that they've gone too far.
[01:17:18.994 --> 01:17:24.636]  And they continue to go too far, and I would encourage anybody that doesn't have a weapon to go out and buy one.
[01:17:25.116 --> 01:17:26.176]  I agree, and God bless you.
[01:17:26.196 --> 01:17:26.937]  Good to hear from you.
[01:17:26.977 --> 01:17:31.218]  Be sure and go out and take a training seminar with that shotgun.
[01:17:31.958 --> 01:17:36.480]  And the main thing is go over safety over and over again, but I'm sure your son's professional and smart about it.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:44.363]  But just always keep it aimed at the ground, and go out and shoot it over and over again until you get familiar with it.
[01:17:44.403 --> 01:17:45.263]  It's really no big deal.
[01:17:45.965 --> 01:17:52.790]  Hollywood gives you this image of a 12-gauge as this big powerful thing that, you know, the old lady pulls the trigger and she flies back through the wall.
[01:17:54.411 --> 01:18:02.417]  The key is you just pull that butt of that gun into your shoulder and it's nothing.
[01:18:04.159 --> 01:18:12.585]  I mean, I've seen people freaking out shooting 7mm Magnums and super high-powered rifles and 50 cals and I don't know what they're talking about.
[01:18:13.433 --> 01:18:16.274]  As long as you pull that sucker into your shoulder, it does nothing.
[01:18:17.695 --> 01:18:24.798]  Now, if you take a high-powered rifle, and you hold that thing about a centimeter off your shoulder, it is going to knock the living tar out of you.
[01:18:27.679 --> 01:18:35.483]  But, I mean, 50 cal with no padding just pushes.
[01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:36.763]  Just nothing.
[01:18:38.304 --> 01:18:39.925]  So there's a lot of other myths out there, too.
[01:18:41.574 --> 01:18:45.477]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more Your Calls.
[01:18:46.237 --> 01:18:48.679]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:18:48.699 --> 01:18:50.660]  Ted Anders from Midas, December 20th, 2007.
[01:18:50.780 --> 01:18:53.202]  Gold 79710 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $821.20, $404.75 for half, $202.38 for quarter.
[01:18:54.162 --> 01:18:54.483]  That's $821.20, $404.75, and $202.38.
[01:19:08.095 --> 01:19:11.377]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[01:19:11.697 --> 01:19:15.899]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[01:19:16.279 --> 01:19:20.242]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.443]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[01:19:22.963 --> 01:19:24.644]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[01:19:24.924 --> 01:19:30.905]  The ideas of strong currency ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[01:19:31.185 --> 01:19:37.947]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[01:19:38.307 --> 01:19:39.167]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[01:19:39.187 --> 01:19:39.487]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.507 --> 01:19:42.528]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[01:19:42.688 --> 01:19:42.988]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:19:43.048 --> 01:19:44.448]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[01:19:54.321 --> 01:19:55.222]  Ho, ho, ho!
[01:19:55.342 --> 01:19:57.184]  Santa, when I grow up, I want to be an inventor!
[01:19:57.504 --> 01:19:58.345]  Oh, no, little girl.
[01:19:58.385 --> 01:19:58.786]  Not that.
[01:19:58.846 --> 01:19:59.707]  Not in Utah.
[01:19:59.747 --> 01:20:01.148]  You could end up like Paul Pantone.
[01:20:01.168 --> 01:20:02.009]  Who is Pantone?
[01:20:02.049 --> 01:20:08.676]  Paul Pantone invented a wonderful system called DEEP to double or triple gas mileage and reduce car pollution by over 90%.
[01:20:09.417 --> 01:20:12.080]  Many people are experimenting with it all over the world today.
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:12.420]  Wow!
[01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:17.944]  Then Paul refused to sell control of Geek to some very bad men, so you know what they did?
[01:20:18.004 --> 01:20:18.784]  What, Santa?
[01:20:18.824 --> 01:20:23.648]  They conspired with more bad men in court to destroy Paul and swipe Geek anyway.
[01:20:23.948 --> 01:20:27.230]  They lied about Pantone and framed him for securities fraud.
[01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:27.951]  Oh dear!
[01:20:28.171 --> 01:20:30.693]  His lawyer sold out and said Paul was crazy.
[01:20:31.093 --> 01:20:35.536]  Then Judge Royal Hanson was bad and sent Paul Pantone to the Utah State Mental Hospital.
[01:20:36.036 --> 01:20:39.460]  Hanson ordered Paul to take deadly drugs that also ruin his thinking.
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:44.125]  Hanson even refused to let Paul have the good lawyer Paul's friends found to help save him.
[01:20:44.305 --> 01:20:46.808]  Santa, isn't everyone supposed to have the lawyer they want?
[01:20:46.868 --> 01:20:48.650]  Judge Royal Hanson doesn't think so.
[01:20:48.770 --> 01:20:49.431]  Oh my!
[01:20:49.471 --> 01:20:52.634]  So Paul got an appeal and refused to take the bad drugs.
[01:20:52.895 --> 01:20:56.719]  The people at the state hospital didn't like that and treated Paul very badly.
[01:20:57.339 --> 01:20:59.482]  They made him walk on a broken foot for over a year.
[01:20:59.682 --> 01:21:01.564]  They drilled into his teeth and didn't fill them.
[01:21:01.885 --> 01:21:06.129]  He was even strapped into a chair with very little pain medicine as the dentist drilled.
[01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:09.253]  Many teeth rotted, fell out, or broke in half.
[01:21:09.674 --> 01:21:15.921]  Paul caught a deadly disease called Hepatitis C. The hospital didn't give Paul any medicine to treat it.
[01:21:16.764 --> 01:21:26.410]  So Paul Pantone, the inventor who tried to help everyone, now spends every day an innocent prisoner in pain, dying from neglect and abuse at the Utah State Hospital.
[01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.850]  Santa!
[01:21:27.050 --> 01:21:27.671]  Yes, child?
[01:21:27.731 --> 01:21:30.673]  Will you send a lump of coal for Christmas to the people who did this?
[01:21:30.793 --> 01:21:32.514]  That's a very good idea.
[01:21:32.694 --> 01:21:34.095]  Can I send a lump of coal too?
[01:21:34.355 --> 01:21:39.962]  For more information on what you can do, see www.geetfriends.net.
[01:21:40.202 --> 01:21:43.666]  That's www.geetfriends.net.
[01:21:43.686 --> 01:21:44.147]  Or call 510-594-4338.
[01:21:44.247 --> 01:21:44.467]  That's 510-594-4338.
[01:21:53.968 --> 01:21:55.829]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:55.969 --> 01:22:01.130]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:02.651]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:22:02.931 --> 01:22:11.094]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:22:11.314 --> 01:22:17.096]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:22:17.116 --> 01:22:18.996]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:22:19.076 --> 01:22:21.177]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:22:21.357 --> 01:22:21.677]  I think so.
[01:22:36.448 --> 01:22:36.928]  We're good to go.
[01:23:05.814 --> 01:23:09.295]  Short segment, long segment coming up with Daniel Estillant.
[01:23:09.415 --> 01:23:18.397]  Daniel, we're going to get off the Ron Paul thing here in a minute, but obviously now we've got to do an article at TruthNews.us and PrisonPlanet.com because I brought this up six months ago to the congressman.
[01:23:18.417 --> 01:23:23.778]  He said, yeah, if I get big enough, if this movement gets big enough, it was already exponentially growing then.
[01:23:23.818 --> 01:23:25.319]  He saw where the trajectory was going.
[01:23:25.719 --> 01:23:27.219]  He said they've killed a lot of people.
[01:23:27.259 --> 01:23:28.479]  He said they've shot a lot of people.
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:29.900]  That's a real danger.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:34.581]  And coming from you, who's not a man of rumors, this is a big concern.
[01:23:35.639 --> 01:23:43.843]  So if they're not scared of him getting killed and causing an explosion in the freedom movement, why then are these intelligence agents upset?
[01:23:43.924 --> 01:23:45.124]  Because they like Ron Paul?
[01:23:45.144 --> 01:23:47.025]  Or because they see it as evil?
[01:23:47.726 --> 01:23:48.526]  Or they didn't tell you?
[01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:56.225]  Well, I think Alex, more than anything else, the intelligence people are patriots.
[01:23:56.305 --> 01:23:57.206]  I know a lot of them.
[01:23:57.246 --> 01:23:58.747]  You probably know quite a few as well.
[01:23:59.168 --> 01:24:06.995]  And as you know, the people who join the intelligence community, more than anything else, they love their country and they want to serve their country.
[01:24:07.495 --> 01:24:27.408]  And what they're seeing, you know, with the Bilderbergers and such, is this creation of a global network of giant cartels, more powerful than any nation on the planet, destined to control the necessities of life of the rest of humanity, who do not work for the country and do not represent our and their interests.
[01:24:27.768 --> 01:24:33.231]  Which is why they're so absolutely paranoid of what might happen if this man gets eliminated.
[01:24:33.551 --> 01:24:35.993]  Because again, we have to do something now.
[01:24:36.013 --> 01:24:37.694]  We're at the end of the end.
[01:24:37.714 --> 01:24:39.434]  This isn't the beginning of the end.
[01:24:39.775 --> 01:24:49.300]  Unless we can do something over a very short term, the window of opportunity to get this world back is closing rapidly.
[01:24:49.907 --> 01:24:50.828]  Let's explain that.
[01:24:50.928 --> 01:24:52.309]  They are monopoly men.
[01:24:52.329 --> 01:24:57.674]  I've got Aaron Dykes coming in for like five minutes later because he's just written a big article about, we know Rick Perry went to Bilderberg.
[01:24:58.255 --> 01:25:02.019]  Now the mainstream news is talking about him being Giuliani's running mate.
[01:25:02.759 --> 01:25:06.583]  They're both involved, Giuliani's over the North American Union Highway System.
[01:25:07.624 --> 01:25:11.948]  His law firm literally has the contract with Sentra with the roads being handed over.
[01:25:12.028 --> 01:25:13.890]  These are the, we see the corporate
[01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:19.060]  Interlocking structures literally stepping into the positions of government administration.
[01:25:19.361 --> 01:25:20.864]  I mean, they're openly taking over.
[01:25:20.884 --> 01:25:21.606]  Can you speak to that?
[01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:23.119]  Well, absolutely.
[01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:38.843]  I mean, you're looking at the oligarchy, which is basically, essentially, a private criminal enterprise, which stretches across the globe, operating through a network of government agencies, private institutions, and both publicly owned and private corporations and financial institutions.
[01:25:39.223 --> 01:25:45.365]  Now, this extended network, and you and I have talked about this before, stretches all the way back to the Middle Ages.
[01:25:45.425 --> 01:25:49.726]  Again, this is what used to be called the family's fondio funds.
[01:25:50.293 --> 01:26:02.562]  You know, oligarchical families and their monies pulled together for maximum effect and deployed through a network of financial institutions, which hide their origins from the unsuspecting public.
[01:26:02.922 --> 01:26:09.087]  And again, unless people see it, they don't believe it, which is what the mass media entertainment has done to us.
[01:26:09.547 --> 01:26:16.472]  And they will laugh in our face, the people, because they can't see that beyond the reality of a television set.
[01:26:16.912 --> 01:26:21.097]  There is another reality, far more terrifying and far more real.
[01:26:21.378 --> 01:26:25.543]  And that is what you and I have been doing, trying to get this reality out.
[01:26:28.306 --> 01:26:30.328]  How do you see this collision playing out?
[01:26:30.409 --> 01:26:36.416]  Because the globalists now recognize that they're facing more and more opposition, but they seem to be accelerating their program.
[01:26:38.115 --> 01:26:54.582]  Well, I think again, Alex, to go back to the tried-and-true cliché, I think it's the people are leading this fight, and the European Constitution, which was actually not a constitution, it's a watered-down version of a constitution, was signed yesterday, I believe, in Lisbon.
[01:26:54.882 --> 01:26:59.584]  It only goes to show you that they couldn't ram it through the Europeans.
[01:27:00.024 --> 01:27:12.951]  Because the French and the Dutch said absolutely no, so what they've done is they've created another version which basically bypasses people's votes and goes right to the technocrats and their opinion making.
[01:27:12.971 --> 01:27:16.212]  That's dictatorial system.
[01:27:16.252 --> 01:27:17.513]  That's dictatorship right there.
[01:27:18.594 --> 01:27:40.867]  Well, you know, if you read the European press, what they're basically telling you is that we are very, very lucky, we the people in Europe, that we don't have to worry about these trivial, tridle, you know, piddly things such as the Constitution, and we can just go on and do our things and let the bureaucrats and the politicians take care of all these other things which we supposedly don't want anything to do with.
[01:27:41.307 --> 01:28:01.065]  Of course, that is not exactly the case, because again, the European Constitution, or whatever this document that they're calling it is, it has destroyed the concept of nation-states, it has destroyed the concept of national constitutions, because now, as of this very moment, the European Constitution takes precedence
[01:28:01.565 --> 01:28:10.391]  Well, it certainly is.
[01:28:11.191 --> 01:28:15.995]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[01:28:16.175 --> 01:28:17.876]  How they created Europe by stealth.
[01:28:18.036 --> 01:28:24.100]  Now they're fully getting rid of the last vestiges of national sovereignty and any liberty or transparency.
[01:28:25.083 --> 01:28:27.364]  It's the same thing they're doing with the American Union.
[01:28:27.384 --> 01:28:36.166]  I want you to talk about, as you did on Coast to Coast AM a month ago with me, and George, about how they've already got Blackwater up there running security in Canada.
[01:28:36.426 --> 01:28:42.748]  The merger is already happening with our guest Daniel Estill and his new book, published in the U.S.
[01:28:44.269 --> 01:28:45.189]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.649 --> 01:28:47.270]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.170 --> 01:28:50.891]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.207 --> 01:28:59.712]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.132 --> 01:29:04.376]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:04.797 --> 01:29:11.663]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:12.103 --> 01:29:18.805]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:19.125 --> 01:29:20.725]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:29:21.025 --> 01:29:24.206]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.486 --> 01:29:26.947]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:29:27.247 --> 01:29:33.989]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.429 --> 01:29:37.111]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:29:41.193 --> 01:29:42.974]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:29:54.193 --> 01:29:58.474]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:29:58.714 --> 01:30:03.595]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:05.116]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:30:05.316 --> 01:30:08.676]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:14.098]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[01:30:20.439 --> 01:30:22.861]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.

[01:30:29.105 --> 01:30:30.046]  No animal testing.
[01:30:30.306 --> 01:30:31.627]  I use them and love them.
[01:30:31.647 --> 01:30:33.228]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:30:33.528 --> 01:30:34.669]  And I say it big time.
[01:30:34.949 --> 01:30:36.430]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:36.831]  That's 1-800-340-7091.

[01:30:46.417 --> 01:30:49.102]  Again, that number, 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:30:54.093 --> 01:30:57.434]  Attention GCN listeners who suffer from excruciating joint pain.
[01:30:57.754 --> 01:31:04.656]  If you're interested in suppressed but amazingly effective traditional arthritis remedies, this will be the single most important message you'll ever hear.
[01:31:05.036 --> 01:31:17.519]  Recently, a scientist who specializes in ancient medicine has discovered a 3,000 year old arthritis remedy that has been proven in studies not only to relieve joint pain and inflammation, but also to build damaged cartilage as well.
[01:31:17.759 --> 01:31:20.400]  And the amazing thing is just how fast it works.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:26.944]  Now, because the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made for this ancient remedy.
[01:31:27.184 --> 01:31:32.327]  However, it is still legal to own it, and right now, a small amount is available to my listeners.
[01:31:32.567 --> 01:31:40.831]  Keep in mind, shipments get filled on a first-come, first-served basis, so it's important that you take immediate action by going to 321relief.com.
[01:31:41.031 --> 01:31:41.672]  And the best part?
[01:31:41.912 --> 01:31:43.913]  My listeners pay absolutely nothing today.
[01:31:44.153 --> 01:31:46.434]  Simply go to 321release.com or call 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:31:46.454 --> 01:31:49.216]  We just played a little bit of my interview with Daniel Eskalon.
[01:32:12.648 --> 01:32:15.970]  Well, I was trying to get my throat back in order to go on air.
[01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:19.852]  Again, why am I doing the show while I've got a really bad sore throat and earaches?
[01:32:21.473 --> 01:32:22.333]  Who knows why?
[01:32:22.353 --> 01:32:29.077]  I mean, really because the Second Amendment is under big-time attack, and it is the 20th day of December 2007.
[01:32:29.137 --> 01:32:34.660]  We've got Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:32:35.925 --> 01:32:50.904]  For those that don't know, Congress slams the Second Amendment, passes a huge expansion of federal gun control on to anybody who's ever had post-traumatic stress disorder, anybody who's ever had ADHD, all these fake disorders.
[01:32:50.924 --> 01:32:52.125]  They create hundreds a year.
[01:32:52.185 --> 01:32:53.627]  Literally, one year they create like 150 new ones.
[01:32:56.252 --> 01:33:00.294]  They've got lots of disorders for not trusting authority or questioning the government.
[01:33:00.614 --> 01:33:02.074]  That's mental illness now.
[01:33:02.114 --> 01:33:03.575]  We're all mentally ill.
[01:33:04.115 --> 01:33:06.876]  You don't like your mercury pills?
[01:33:07.317 --> 01:33:08.757]  You're insane!
[01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:13.499]  We really are living in complete and total la-la land.
[01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.760]  I've got some other important reports here.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:21.042]  Karl Rove worried about Ron Paul momentum.
[01:33:21.082 --> 01:33:22.923]  That's an interesting story up on the site.
[01:33:23.633 --> 01:33:31.418]  Also, experts say world population will explode by 2025 with influx of megacities of 10 million people or more.
[01:33:31.438 --> 01:33:40.625]  But Taj Mahal is saying they're not going to accept American dollars anymore because they're too debased in value.
[01:33:41.525 --> 01:33:43.306]  They will only accept the rupee.
[01:33:44.407 --> 01:33:47.189]  See, no longer the world reserve currency, now dying.
[01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:54.162]  If you tell the average arrogant yuppie that, they just snicker at you and go, yeah!
[01:33:56.183 --> 01:33:57.943]  They think sneering is half the battle.
[01:33:59.004 --> 01:34:02.205]  FBI agents skip court orders to spy on cell phone users.
[01:34:02.265 --> 01:34:08.027]  Wired Magazine, they're just now getting around to telling everybody that they don't use warrants in regular cases either.
[01:34:08.368 --> 01:34:09.508]  Of course they don't!
[01:34:10.248 --> 01:34:11.509]  Whoever told you they did?
[01:34:14.776 --> 01:34:21.640]  So, also FBI now admits to evidence used to connect Oswald to Kennedy assassination was bogus.
[01:34:24.201 --> 01:34:36.388]  Karl Rove is not just worried about Ron Paul, he's worried about Iran, and there's another top CIA agent saying the US and Israel are still considering hitting Iran before the next election.
[01:34:36.728 --> 01:34:38.509]  And I think that's still on the table, though
[01:34:39.523 --> 01:34:45.949]  Globally, it's very unpopular, and though they're trying to de-escalate in some quarters, Israel's saying they may go ahead and hit Iran.
[01:34:46.569 --> 01:34:57.999]  If Iran as much as fires a BB gun back at them, the defense treaty with Israel will kick in, the media will say, how dare Iran fire back as their country's bombed into oblivion.
[01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:00.962]  See, where's common sense gone, too?
[01:35:01.722 --> 01:35:06.226]  A lot of Americans will say, how dare them Iranians fire back?
[01:35:06.446 --> 01:35:06.987]  I've never...
[01:35:07.845 --> 01:35:09.547]  You'll say, well, where is Iran on the map?
[01:35:09.587 --> 01:35:10.727]  And he'll say, right there!
[01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:12.229]  In part Australia.
[01:35:12.889 --> 01:35:14.110]  Jet Island right there!
[01:35:14.130 --> 01:35:16.332]  They're the ones that did it!
[01:35:16.832 --> 01:35:18.313]  With them kangaroos!
[01:35:21.156 --> 01:35:23.978]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:35:24.018 --> 01:35:26.340]  I got a story here by Kurt Nimmo that's excellent that I will cover.
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:29.842]  Borg Hive Mine Technology, now nearly Main Street.
[01:35:30.903 --> 01:35:32.204]  So, that's some of what's coming up.
[01:35:32.224 --> 01:35:34.766]  You know, I guess callers thought I was going to rebroadcast.
[01:35:35.987 --> 01:35:36.768]  I was actually, uh,
[01:35:38.197 --> 01:35:38.897]  Throwing a fit.
[01:35:39.738 --> 01:35:42.119]  So, uh, if you would like to call back in on air, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:42.139 --> 01:35:42.199]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:35:42.219 --> 01:35:44.980]  And, uh, just have your question and comment ready when we go to you.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.860]  Because, uh, I'm kind of in pea brain mode today.
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:46.940]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:36:07.882 --> 01:36:10.463]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[01:36:13.424 --> 01:36:15.725]  And we'll take some of your phone calls.
[01:36:16.266 --> 01:36:20.848]  Coming up the next hour, Congress slams Second Amendment.
[01:36:21.528 --> 01:36:22.088]  Again, the U.S.
[01:36:22.128 --> 01:36:36.154]  Congress has approved the first major gun control legislation in more than a decade, broadening background checks, it's really federal registration, and adding anyone who's quote, been troubled, any type of psychological designation,
[01:36:38.311 --> 01:36:43.695]  Which they hand out like lollipops when you got your hair cut when you were a kid.
[01:36:44.656 --> 01:36:48.559]  It's just, oh, you're this, you're that, you've got this problem, you've got that problem.
[01:36:49.159 --> 01:36:51.661]  Oh, this is great, I get these happy pills for no reason.
[01:36:52.322 --> 01:36:54.864]  And it's all paid for by my insurance.
[01:36:54.884 --> 01:36:57.346]  Yeah, it's paid for by your insurance, Mac.
[01:36:58.947 --> 01:37:00.048]  You're being sucked in.
[01:37:00.108 --> 01:37:01.909]  You're being institutionalized.
[01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:05.012]  You're being brought in to the control grid.
[01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:07.994]  Before I go to some of your calls, I just want to briefly mention
[01:37:09.153 --> 01:37:29.479]  That we do have PrisonPlanet.tv and for 15 cents a day you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a monthly membership $5.95 a month or get the yearly membership during the month of December we have a special going
[01:37:30.251 --> 01:37:36.532]  A super sale, 5.3 months, over 5 months free, of PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:37:46.014 --> 01:37:48.515]  You can burn it as a disc or DVD and give it to friends and family.
[01:37:49.775 --> 01:37:52.196]  Of course, there's also Terror Storm.
[01:37:53.496 --> 01:37:55.416]  First and second edition is up there.
[01:37:55.897 --> 01:37:57.457]  All of my other films, the other 15 films,
[01:37:58.832 --> 01:38:01.374]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my weekly TV reports.
[01:38:01.394 --> 01:38:02.695]  We put up two reports this week.
[01:38:03.476 --> 01:38:04.817]  Two more going up next week.
[01:38:05.917 --> 01:38:08.079]  There is just so much at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:38:08.119 --> 01:38:13.883]  In April it will be four years of operation of PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:38:14.664 --> 01:38:16.305]  Okay, who should I go to first here?
[01:38:18.887 --> 01:38:20.568]  Skip in California.
[01:38:20.608 --> 01:38:21.669]  You're on the air, Skip.
[01:38:24.211 --> 01:38:27.934]  Hey, I just saw a film on
[01:38:28.704 --> 01:38:35.768]  Yeah, in the other thing I want to say, the biggest thing to get the word out is that I've seen so far the Ron Paul meetup groups
[01:38:59.507 --> 01:39:05.030]  Members of my group have taken copies of Freedom to Fascism and gone to the Republican groups in the area.
[01:39:06.011 --> 01:39:12.455]  And when they showed up at these meetings, some of the members will laugh and say, oh, you like Ron Paul's head crazy.
[01:39:13.075 --> 01:39:17.598]  Well, then they've given them copies of Freedom to Fascism and said, well, I tell you what, just watch this.
[01:39:17.698 --> 01:39:21.681]  If you don't agree, then I won't go to the meeting and I won't come here anymore.
[01:39:21.701 --> 01:39:26.424]  And now some of those people in the Republican groups are members of our group.
[01:39:27.358 --> 01:39:30.880]  Well, that's what's so great about this Ron Paul revolution that's happening right now.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:36.023]  It comes at the perfect time as people are more angry and disgruntled and upset with the system than ever.
[01:39:36.863 --> 01:39:53.952]  And so there's tens of thousands of these meet-up groups that have formed, hundreds of thousands of members, and you can go on and form local groups to defend the Second Amendment, or form local groups to defend the national sovereignty against the border invaders.
[01:39:54.784 --> 01:39:57.745]  There is so much we can do and now is the time.
[01:39:59.425 --> 01:39:59.845]  That's right.
[01:40:00.746 --> 01:40:02.286]  I just wanted to throw an idea out there.
[01:40:02.646 --> 01:40:09.588]  One of the ideas that we came up with at my group was for $70 around there you can get a remote controllable blimp.
[01:40:10.688 --> 01:40:19.811]  And what we want to do is start getting those that come like the Ron Paul blimp and then take them to different farmers markets or wherever you
[01:40:20.948 --> 01:40:23.430]  Uh, campaign for Ron Paul and fly it around.
[01:40:23.490 --> 01:40:26.472]  It'll get, uh, the attention of kids that see it, will want to try it out.
[01:40:26.832 --> 01:40:29.814]  And, you know, maybe some of their parents will come over and talk to you about Ron Paul.
[01:40:30.314 --> 01:40:37.819]  But I also thought, what a great way to go to, like, any kind of a rally for Giuliani or Fred Thompson or something and have Ron Paul blimp there.
[01:40:38.420 --> 01:40:40.141]  It's just going to attract attention to us.
[01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:49.347]  And you're talking about, they've even got the little ones, but they're still like, you know, eight, nine feet long, that you can just pump up with helium and then run up at any event.
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:50.900]  Yep.
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:52.500]  Good idea, I think.
[01:40:53.321 --> 01:40:54.221]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:40:54.241 --> 01:40:55.541]  I appreciate your call, my friend.
[01:40:56.141 --> 01:40:57.822]  Mark in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:41:00.083 --> 01:41:00.983]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:41:02.223 --> 01:41:03.123]  I'm doing okay.
[01:41:03.643 --> 01:41:06.904]  Okay, I just wanted to read something to you.
[01:41:07.044 --> 01:41:11.225]  I had come across somebody slamming Ron Paul on Google.
[01:41:11.906 --> 01:41:13.046]  I mean, on YouTube.
[01:41:13.872 --> 01:41:21.399]  And so I wrote him a little letter, and I said, hey, you know, this guy's defending your Constitution, giving you the right to say these things, you know?
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:34.571]  And he went ahead and emailed me back, and he says, you say all these things, but you fail to see the idea of a one-world government, despite many people suffering during the current economic slowdown crisis.
[01:41:35.092 --> 01:41:38.615]  I actually predicted it, and have made a lot of money from it.
[01:41:39.369 --> 01:41:56.942]  Then he goes on to say that he can't wait for a disaster or something to happen so he can have more years of Bush Cheney, and he wants to see us go to war with Iran and Syria, and then he signed it that he's a banker, Lawrence Silverstein, in New York.
[01:41:59.304 --> 01:42:01.726]  Yeah, I've seen that individual on the web.
[01:42:01.786 --> 01:42:08.771]  I think that's a pun, or I think it's like kind of a tongue-in-cheek deal where they go out and say outrageous things in the name of Larry Silverstein.
[01:42:10.006 --> 01:42:10.206]  Yeah.
[01:42:10.406 --> 01:42:12.268]  There's actually a website doing that, sir.
[01:42:14.009 --> 01:42:22.216]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring that up because he's saying things like Ron Paul hates Jews and stuff like that.
[01:42:22.977 --> 01:42:26.700]  I just thought that's, you know, definitely... Yeah, no, I know the website.
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:27.220]  It's fake.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:35.027]  It's a, I believe, analyzing a white supremacist who is, because he writes all the stuff like he's an Israeli.
[01:42:35.988 --> 01:42:37.689]  And it's just off the top crazy.
[01:42:38.189 --> 01:42:39.990]  And there's no way it's real.
[01:42:40.350 --> 01:42:40.950]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:45.212]  But I'm glad you called about it, though, because I've looked at it and analyzed it.
[01:42:46.812 --> 01:42:47.772]  Very outrageous.
[01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:49.353]  It's a Ron Paul supporter.
[01:42:50.934 --> 01:42:52.494]  And probably a white supremacist.
[01:42:53.735 --> 01:42:55.135]  I've got an idea who it is, too.
[01:42:55.155 --> 01:42:57.656]  I haven't looked up who it's registered with, but I bet I know.
[01:42:58.456 --> 01:42:59.497]  Bob in Arizona.
[01:42:59.517 --> 01:43:00.157]  You're on the air.
[01:43:00.217 --> 01:43:00.517]  Welcome.
[01:43:01.858 --> 01:43:02.078]  Yes.
[01:43:03.258 --> 01:43:03.418]  Hi.
[01:43:06.604 --> 01:43:06.864]  Uh-huh.
[01:43:09.405 --> 01:43:10.085]  Can I help you, sir?
[01:43:10.965 --> 01:43:12.365]  Yes, is this Alex Jones?
[01:43:12.465 --> 01:43:13.326]  Yes, sure is, uh-huh.
[01:43:14.206 --> 01:43:15.506]  Oh, yes, for a minute there, it clicked.
[01:43:15.546 --> 01:43:16.706]  It sounded like I lost the connection.
[01:43:16.726 --> 01:43:17.566]  I was on a cell phone.
[01:43:17.586 --> 01:43:21.387]  Okay, well listen, Bob in Arizona, you are definitely on air, I assure you.
[01:43:22.007 --> 01:43:33.230]  I want to thank you and Ron Paul for the wonderful work that you're doing, and I've been keeping you, Alex, and your family in my prayers just so some of those goon squads doesn't come after you and cause you some trouble.
[01:43:34.494 --> 01:43:35.815]  Well, I appreciate that.
[01:43:35.835 --> 01:43:38.036]  Because I know the kind of evil that they are.
[01:43:38.056 --> 01:43:38.656]  They're nasty.
[01:43:38.676 --> 01:43:42.058]  They're just, you know, they wouldn't hesitate in killing any of us.
[01:43:42.398 --> 01:43:44.279]  They dress in basic black, what does that tell you?
[01:43:44.599 --> 01:43:44.980]  Right out of 1938.
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:49.222]  You know, so it's just terrifying.
[01:43:49.802 --> 01:44:01.969]  And the question that I wanted to ask, I saw the interview last night with Ron Paul, he was on Glenn Beck, and I was amazed at how Glenn Beck seems to be turning around, maybe he's seen
[01:44:04.431 --> 01:44:05.552]  He's always done that.
[01:44:05.612 --> 01:44:06.533]  It's pure deception.
[01:44:07.394 --> 01:44:07.694]  It is?
[01:44:07.754 --> 01:44:09.976]  Well, boy, it was a fantastic interview, though.
[01:44:10.016 --> 01:44:14.520]  I mean, it was really... You got to hear Ron Paul actually speak for a change instead of getting cut off.
[01:44:15.721 --> 01:44:17.543]  And I agree totally with what he's saying.
[01:44:17.563 --> 01:44:18.363]  He's a smart man.
[01:44:18.704 --> 01:44:20.645]  I just pray to God he doesn't get himself killed.
[01:44:20.665 --> 01:44:30.554]  You know, it's just... When somebody's out there speaking the truth, you know, it's just... So, I'm keeping you and Ron Paul and your family in my prayers.
[01:44:31.195 --> 01:44:34.596]  And just go get them, Alex, and just don't let up until we win.
[01:44:34.876 --> 01:44:35.636]  You too, my friend.
[01:44:35.656 --> 01:44:36.396]  Good to hear from you.
[01:44:37.156 --> 01:44:46.698]  I have no doubt that I'd be in prison or dead if it wasn't for your prayers, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm very thankful for all of those, and I'm very thankful to all of our sponsors, listeners, affiliates, everybody.
[01:44:47.318 --> 01:44:59.541]  Good old John Harmon running the show, Craig Kincaid producing here in Austin, Texas, everybody in my office, Mike Nelson and Weldon and Aaron and Rob and
[01:45:01.542 --> 01:45:11.687]  Amanda, so many other people, Michelle, the Watsons, Duane, everybody.
[01:45:14.048 --> 01:45:16.790]  Let's go ahead and talk to Olive in California.
[01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:18.270]  Olive, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:20.711]  Hi, Mr. Alex Jones.
[01:45:20.872 --> 01:45:27.355]  I just wanted to let you know that I've been listening for a little while and I am a practicing witch.
[01:45:28.266 --> 01:45:39.769]  You talk a lot about the occult because of its involvement with the New World Order, and I wanted to just throw out there the actual definition of magic by Aleister Crowley.
[01:45:40.469 --> 01:45:41.929]  It means anything hidden.
[01:45:42.589 --> 01:45:42.849]  Huh?
[01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:43.990]  Anything hidden.
[01:45:44.710 --> 01:45:45.530]  Anything hidden?
[01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:47.431]  What do you mean by that?
[01:45:47.471 --> 01:45:47.771]  I'm sorry.
[01:45:47.791 --> 01:45:49.211]  Well, I mean the occult means hidden.
[01:45:49.878 --> 01:45:50.799]  Yes, yes.
[01:45:50.899 --> 01:45:54.802]  The actual definition of occult means mystery or hidden knowledge.
[01:45:55.623 --> 01:46:11.496]  But the word magic, as defined by Aleister Crowley, is a science and art of causing change to occur, the conformity with will, as your own personal will, using means not currently understood by traditional Western science.
[01:46:12.356 --> 01:46:18.381]  And in going with that, I also saw an article that your people have posted about the
[01:46:20.493 --> 01:46:21.114]  I'm going to
[01:46:44.491 --> 01:46:49.735]  In a perverse way to get to their means and hurting people.
[01:46:49.875 --> 01:46:57.402]  So you're taking the light path and they're doing the dark thing and that's what you are saying?
[01:46:57.762 --> 01:47:07.950]  Well, yeah, and the other day when we were talking about lesser magic and about white magic and black magic and how there needs to be a balance and I do agree with that.
[01:47:07.970 --> 01:47:09.832]  No, that's what the New World Order says.
[01:47:10.372 --> 01:47:11.353]  Okay, okay.
[01:47:12.314 --> 01:47:34.800]  Well, I just wanted to throw out there that the skull and crossbones has been used for a very long time as a symbol of ancient crossroads and crossing over and ancestral worship and giving homage to your ancestors and reading the article and seeing that the individuals
[01:47:35.419 --> 01:47:37.080]  Do you know what Aleister Crowley did to his son?
[01:48:02.230 --> 01:48:15.899]  Yeah, I mean, he was not a good person, and he's actually a controversy within the Wiccan and Pagan community because of the fact that, of all the knowledge that he brought, he was just such a horrible person.
[01:48:15.959 --> 01:48:27.147]  He used to beat his own servants, and to say somebody, do what thy will, but harm none, and him turn around and not walk the walk of what he had just said.
[01:48:27.247 --> 01:48:30.249]  He said, do as thou will, that is the whole of the law.
[01:48:30.769 --> 01:48:36.234]  That's some added baloney that liberals today add to what he said.
[01:48:36.274 --> 01:48:37.735]  He didn't say harm none.
[01:48:37.755 --> 01:48:41.699]  Well, yeah, that's Gardnerian and Alexandrian right there.
[01:48:43.672 --> 01:48:49.294]  Yeah, I'm just a little nervous talking because so many people... No, but my point is, Aleister Crowley was extremely wicked.
[01:48:49.314 --> 01:48:59.977]  And I get people who are in the occult and the rest of it saying, well, I'm a good person and I'm into helping people and you shouldn't say that our roots are in human sacrifice.
[01:49:00.497 --> 01:49:02.158]  Every major pagan movement
[01:49:03.141 --> 01:49:09.668]  From even Midwestern Indians, Native Americans, to the Aztecs, to the Druids, different populations.
[01:49:09.688 --> 01:49:10.629]  I completely agree with that.
[01:49:10.689 --> 01:49:12.271]  They all sacrifice people.
[01:49:12.892 --> 01:49:14.213]  They all sacrifice people.
[01:49:14.253 --> 01:49:22.442]  And I'm telling you, the New World Order, in their own writings, believes in this and believes that there are too many people and they need to kill 80% of us.
[01:49:24.211 --> 01:49:27.433]  And I believe that's a beautiful thing they're doing, and I don't think it's beautiful at all.
[01:49:27.773 --> 01:49:28.574]  And I agree with you.
[01:49:28.634 --> 01:49:44.085]  I think that that's completely horrible, and there's a common idea within the Wiccan community that, yes, there are too many people in the world, and that the earth needs to be treated better, and the only way that can happen is... Well, stay there.
[01:49:44.105 --> 01:49:46.707]  I want to hear what you have to say, but I don't want to cut you off.
[01:49:46.727 --> 01:49:47.568]  We've got the break here.
[01:49:48.168 --> 01:49:49.769]  We'll be right back with more of your calls.
[01:49:49.809 --> 01:49:51.711]  We've got Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman coming up.
[01:49:54.392 --> 01:49:55.793]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:55.813 --> 01:49:57.915]  A new world order.
[01:49:58.635 --> 01:50:02.819]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:03.519 --> 01:50:06.322]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:06.342 --> 01:50:08.603]  Won't their objective be world domination?
[01:50:09.144 --> 01:50:11.526]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:12.310 --> 01:50:19.797]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:22.679 --> 01:50:27.624]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:28.124 --> 01:50:31.588]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:31.968 --> 01:50:34.490]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the World Government.
[01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:35.692]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:35.712 --> 01:50:36.472]  They're not after money.
[01:50:36.492 --> 01:50:37.573]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:37.774 --> 01:50:38.494]  They're after power.
[01:50:38.755 --> 01:50:39.756]  That's what they're after, you see.

[01:51:53.360 --> 01:51:54.241]  Storable Food!
[01:51:54.461 --> 01:51:55.241]  Storable Food!
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:23.580]  I think so.
[01:52:55.007 --> 01:53:00.930]  Hopefully I'll be better tomorrow.
[01:53:01.150 --> 01:53:03.551]  And back in the saddle.
[01:53:21.548 --> 01:53:39.967]  We replayed a little clip of Eskildon earlier, because I meant to mention that he will be back on tomorrow live from Spain with more intel on the higher circles of the New World Order discussing what would happen if they killed Ron Paul.
[01:53:42.169 --> 01:53:45.112]  Let's go back to Olive and then we'll go to James.
[01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:47.751]  And others that are patiently holding.
[01:53:49.413 --> 01:54:03.064]  Listen, I'm not here to bash Catholics or Protestants any more than I'm here to bash people that are openly into, you know, old time religion, as you guys like to call it.
[01:54:03.584 --> 01:54:04.625]  All that pagan stuff.
[01:54:05.385 --> 01:54:08.468]  I mean, most of these mainline Christian churches are pagan themselves.
[01:54:09.068 --> 01:54:09.809]  I am a Christian.
[01:54:10.695 --> 01:54:12.876]  And I do believe in, you know, Jesus.
[01:54:12.916 --> 01:54:20.720]  They can put out movies and claim it's, you know, just a repeat of earlier gods and all the rest of it.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:29.984]  All I know is the people I've ever been around who are into the occult are a bunch of power-hungry, grasping, unhappy, scamming ne'er-do-wells.
[01:54:30.965 --> 01:54:33.006]  And I ran into it repeatedly when I was growing up.
[01:54:33.969 --> 01:54:49.396]  And I just wrote the New World Orders into it, and I know so many people who claim that they're into goodness and good magic and all this stuff, but then they're always big fans of Aleister Crowley, who, if you ask me, was just a big nerd, needed to be slapped upside the head.
[01:54:50.216 --> 01:55:02.422]  And so, you know, I mean, that's basically just what it comes down to, is that I'm not here bashing people or attacking people or even trying to judge people.
[01:55:03.274 --> 01:55:10.659]  I just, I tend to agree with what Anton LaVey said, and he was, and I don't like Anton LaVey, by the way.
[01:55:10.859 --> 01:55:14.702]  I'm saying I agree with what he said about there's no difference.
[01:55:15.002 --> 01:55:20.306]  I mean, if you're going to be into this stuff, you might as well just go all the way, because it's all part of the same system.
[01:55:21.027 --> 01:55:22.448]  And then you talk about balance.
[01:55:22.528 --> 01:55:32.815]  Well, that's how they get you over into, openly, you know, I mean, a world of a bunch of self-centered people doing as thou wilt.
[01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:38.133]  And feeding on other people and getting off on the power of dominating other people.
[01:55:38.193 --> 01:55:39.173]  It's hellish!
[01:55:40.154 --> 01:55:42.916]  And that's the ultimate expression of the New World Order.
[01:55:42.956 --> 01:55:44.337]  I mean, they're such control freaks.
[01:55:44.377 --> 01:55:47.659]  They want to kill the majority of us to control the future.
[01:55:47.879 --> 01:55:48.559]  But just go ahead.
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:54.783]  Well, what I think is really interesting, from some of the point of view
[01:55:55.530 --> 01:55:55.810]  Of course.
[01:56:07.842 --> 01:56:10.624]  Not like the fact that I have the potential to hurt people.
[01:56:11.104 --> 01:56:12.785]  The devil did not make me do that.
[01:56:13.325 --> 01:56:13.826]  I lied.
[01:56:14.046 --> 01:56:16.367]  I had the power to do that and I chose to do that.
[01:56:16.707 --> 01:56:31.156]  Now, I don't necessarily like myself when that happens or when I think bad thoughts about other people, but I have taken that power away from some other demigod or the devil, the Christian devil, and have put that
[01:56:31.677 --> 01:56:32.539]  I don't know.
[01:56:39.686 --> 01:56:50.655]  That would be Pan, and the Christian devil was created by the Catholic Church in order to... No, there were always devils.
[01:56:50.675 --> 01:56:52.716]  There's always been the devil.
[01:56:53.637 --> 01:56:57.800]  I mean, that'd be Pluto, or I mean, there's a lot of... Hades.
[01:56:57.941 --> 01:56:59.842]  Yeah, exactly, same God.
[01:57:00.122 --> 01:57:01.744]  Hades with the Greeks, Pluto with the Romans.
[01:57:02.284 --> 01:57:03.525]  I mean, there's always a devil.
[01:57:03.845 --> 01:57:06.127]  There's always a God that likes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:57:06.147 --> 01:57:08.529]  Yeah, but God created devil.
[01:57:10.154 --> 01:57:12.155]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[01:57:55.203 --> 01:57:56.044]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.784 --> 01:57:57.745]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.345 --> 01:58:02.048]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.528 --> 01:58:06.611]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.505 --> 01:58:15.646]  A horrible blow against the very heart of the Second Amendment has taken place.
[01:58:16.446 --> 01:58:20.067]  Round 2 of decapitation is coming up in March of next year.
[01:58:21.407 --> 01:58:23.548]  Brace for enemy bombardment.
[01:58:23.588 --> 01:58:24.068]  Get ready.
[01:58:24.628 --> 01:58:25.428]  Mobilize.
[01:58:25.468 --> 01:58:26.749]  The NRA is the enemy.
[01:58:27.329 --> 01:58:29.009]  Operating to neutralize our people.
[01:58:29.549 --> 01:58:32.250]  Larry Pratt and Aaron Zellman coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:33.590 --> 01:58:37.531]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to James in Ohio.
[01:58:37.591 --> 01:58:38.351]  James, go ahead.
[01:58:38.371 --> 01:58:40.712]  Nice shot there, Alex.
[01:58:41.451 --> 01:58:41.811]  Welcome.
[01:59:02.405 --> 01:59:03.906]  Yeah, he was railroaded.
[01:59:04.166 --> 01:59:05.027]  Yeah, he was railroaded.
[01:59:05.047 --> 01:59:07.868]  Well, he would get up and talk about the trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[01:59:08.388 --> 01:59:10.269]  He'd talk about government-sponsored terror.
[01:59:10.289 --> 01:59:14.592]  He used to have a thing where, on the floor, he would do a beam-me-up-Scotty thing.
[01:59:14.632 --> 01:59:15.812]  Beam-me-up-Scotty, yeah.
[01:59:16.233 --> 01:59:18.794]  And he would just let loose on the IRS.
[01:59:18.814 --> 01:59:19.354]  No, no, no, no.
[01:59:19.374 --> 01:59:23.216]  They put felon criminals on the stand to lie against him and send him to jail.
[01:59:23.417 --> 01:59:24.137]  Oh, yes.
[01:59:24.297 --> 01:59:31.601]  One of my college professors ended up being the jury foreman on his first trial, which he beat the government.
[01:59:32.307 --> 01:59:33.127]  And it was pretty cool.
[01:59:33.147 --> 01:59:33.507]  That's right.
[01:59:33.527 --> 01:59:35.168]  He had to do double jeopardy, though.
[01:59:36.968 --> 01:59:37.749]  They were after him.
[01:59:38.109 --> 01:59:41.209]  But no, I just think he would be an awesome running mate for Ron Paul.
[01:59:41.810 --> 01:59:46.711]  I don't know how they would be with him being a convicted felon and all that.
[01:59:46.751 --> 01:59:53.893]  Well, I like Traficant, but he's not elegant and genteel or as well-read as Paul.
[01:59:54.493 --> 01:59:56.574]  And he was a Democrat.
[01:59:57.174 --> 01:59:58.314]  He is for the common man.
[01:59:58.594 --> 02:00:00.975]  Well, he certainly... James Traficant was a great guy.
[02:00:01.758 --> 02:00:02.639]  I mean, he's still alive.
[02:00:02.679 --> 02:00:03.700]  He's in prison right now.
[02:00:04.480 --> 02:00:06.743]  Another thing, I had just recently been turned on.
[02:00:06.883 --> 02:00:08.264]  I've been listening about six months.
[02:00:08.624 --> 02:00:13.769]  I really don't get a chance to hear you where I'm from, but I'm a truck driver, so I get to get across country.
[02:00:14.289 --> 02:00:16.171]  And I watched a video.
[02:00:16.191 --> 02:00:17.232]  I don't know if you remember.
[02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:21.956]  It was where a Greyhound bus was stopped and, you know, searched.
[02:00:22.056 --> 02:00:23.918]  Yeah, that's Police State 2, the takeover.
[02:00:24.859 --> 02:00:25.099]  Right.
[02:00:25.872 --> 02:00:33.218]  Well, this was just a little clip I've seen on YouTube, and you spoke of an EOD form?
[02:00:34.279 --> 02:00:39.043]  Yeah, that's why you need to see the full film, by getting the Police State Trilogy.
[02:00:39.063 --> 02:00:43.026]  I mean, I never talk about those first three big films I made.
[02:00:43.046 --> 02:00:51.293]  I mean, first I made America Destroyed by Design, and then I made Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:00:51.813 --> 02:00:55.136]  Total, total, it's over seven hours.
[02:00:55.762 --> 02:00:58.503]  Right, and you have links to that article and what not in that document.
[02:01:24.369 --> 02:01:27.392]  And I tried to get to that document and I can't get it.
[02:01:28.012 --> 02:01:28.873]  The links are broke.
[02:01:28.893 --> 02:01:31.916]  I was wondering is there a way I could get a copy?
[02:01:32.657 --> 02:01:36.360]  Yeah, you know that sounds like InfoWars.com.
[02:01:36.901 --> 02:01:46.870]  You're talking about something from 1998 and the last time I checked on InfoWars.com those links were good and those links were up.
[02:01:47.758 --> 02:01:54.600]  Uh, but, uh, you can read the documents right off the film, and even call the military phone numbers or check the names on it.
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:59.901]  You can see the FBI pull up and give us the document, and see the troops, so it's confirmed as real.
[02:02:00.621 --> 02:02:02.702]  Uh, but I haven't Google-searched that in a long time.
[02:02:02.722 --> 02:02:07.643]  You know, that's probably in one of my three... Well, I'm sorry, now I have four storage buildings.
[02:02:07.663 --> 02:02:09.483]  I don't know why I'm losing a lot of money with them.
[02:02:10.184 --> 02:02:12.344]  Uh, but I do have that document somewhere.
[02:02:12.364 --> 02:02:14.445]  Uh, but what I'll do is a Google-search.
[02:02:14.485 --> 02:02:16.045]  I've got a sneaking suspicion.
[02:02:16.793 --> 02:02:18.675]  That you just didn't know where to look.
[02:02:19.215 --> 02:02:21.056]  Because a few months ago I happened to look that up again.
[02:02:21.096 --> 02:02:21.957]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:21.977 --> 02:02:23.818]  In fact, let me just do that right now.
[02:02:23.878 --> 02:02:25.039]  Larry Pratt is coming up.
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.901]  Then we got Aaron Zellman of JPFO coming on.
[02:02:28.562 --> 02:02:30.143]  I predicted they'd pass this bill.
[02:02:30.964 --> 02:02:33.626]  I predict, and I was right of course, unfortunately.
[02:02:33.646 --> 02:02:35.527]  I'm usually right about 99% of the time.
[02:02:36.187 --> 02:02:39.430]  And I predict the Supreme Court's going to rule against the Second Amendment next March.
[02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:42.532]  We'll see what Larry Pratt thinks of gun owners of America.
[02:02:42.832 --> 02:02:44.554]  The Second Amendment has never needed you more.
[02:02:46.573 --> 02:02:47.974]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:47.994 --> 02:02:50.115]  A New World Order.
[02:02:50.815 --> 02:02:55.057]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:55.697 --> 02:02:57.458]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[02:02:58.519 --> 02:03:00.780]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.781]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:04.501 --> 02:03:11.825]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:14.853 --> 02:03:19.856]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:20.317 --> 02:03:23.779]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:24.159 --> 02:03:26.681]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[02:03:26.741 --> 02:03:27.902]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:27.922 --> 02:03:28.682]  They're not after money.
[02:03:28.702 --> 02:03:29.743]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:29.963 --> 02:03:30.724]  They're after power.
[02:03:30.944 --> 02:03:31.804]  That's what happens here.
[02:03:32.105 --> 02:03:36.648]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[02:03:43.612 --> 02:03:44.653]  You have been warned.

[02:04:46.917 --> 02:04:49.138]  Hey, Dad, we need your help finishing the Christmas tree.
[02:04:49.318 --> 02:04:49.958]  Okay, boys.
[02:04:50.178 --> 02:04:53.319]  I just got a few more Uncivil Liberties DVDs to ship out today.
[02:04:53.519 --> 02:04:55.240]  Why do you guys make Uncivil Liberties?
[02:04:55.340 --> 02:04:58.480]  You know how we like to look at those cool illustrations on rents.com?
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.941]  Yeah, David, these rock.
[02:05:00.141 --> 02:05:01.281]  I like the chips one.
[02:05:01.441 --> 02:05:03.002]  Well, those aren't chocolate chips.
[02:05:03.282 --> 02:05:07.963]  Those are little tracking devices the government wants to put under our skin someday to track us.
[02:05:08.103 --> 02:05:10.244]  You mean the government's not the good guys?
[02:05:10.464 --> 02:05:11.765]  Well, they should be the good guys.
[02:05:11.865 --> 02:05:14.448]  They're supposed to do what we the people say they should do.
[02:05:14.628 --> 02:05:19.133]  But these days, the people are too busy watching their favorite TV shows to keep an eye on the government.
[02:05:19.253 --> 02:05:20.634]  You mean like SpongeBob?
[02:05:20.955 --> 02:05:21.755]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:05:22.116 --> 02:05:27.561]  So we made on civil liberties to help remind everyone to keep an eye on what's happening, not to fall asleep.
[02:05:27.781 --> 02:05:28.262]  Asleep?
[02:05:28.702 --> 02:05:30.224]  It's not even bedtime yet!
[02:05:30.744 --> 02:05:31.385]  Exactly.
[02:05:32.286 --> 02:05:35.929]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[02:05:47.159 --> 02:05:53.165]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.785 --> 02:05:56.768]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.579 --> 02:06:11.225]  A caller called in the last segment and he'd seen on YouTube a video clip from Police State to the Takeover where there are troops out on the streets running a checkpoint.
[02:06:11.245 --> 02:06:12.605]  They're searching a Greyhound bus.
[02:06:13.085 --> 02:06:14.626]  They tell our camera guy to get back.
[02:06:15.166 --> 02:06:17.467]  The FBI pulls up and goes, here's a form for the media.
[02:06:17.847 --> 02:06:19.488]  And then it says, not for distribution.
[02:06:20.048 --> 02:06:24.110]  We're in secret operation in 77 counties assisting in all law enforcement.
[02:06:24.490 --> 02:06:26.191]  Total violation of positive commentators.
[02:06:27.031 --> 02:06:30.572]  Let me go in the film to show Marines who've been secretly trained for it and a lot more.
[02:06:31.333 --> 02:06:38.676]  Sure enough, this article's been up since 1998 and it's martial law is here.
[02:06:41.397 --> 02:06:42.617]  Martial law has begun.
[02:06:42.637 --> 02:06:53.702]  It's a three on the Richter scale and I go there and the I-35 video capture images are good, the article about it is good, but the link to the Army document
[02:06:54.959 --> 02:06:55.719]  Is dead.
[02:06:55.819 --> 02:06:57.960]  Now we did take text out of it and post it.
[02:06:58.901 --> 02:07:03.782]  So I've got to ask my webmaster to see if he can find that.
[02:07:04.563 --> 02:07:08.264]  Man, I tell you what, I just get really tired of stuff like this.
[02:07:10.705 --> 02:07:15.687]  This is my... I mean, this is a treasure trove of information on InfoWars.com.
[02:07:16.347 --> 02:07:18.768]  And yep, the EOD documents are dead.
[02:07:21.838 --> 02:07:24.719]  I will definitely get that back up.
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:27.061]  But, you know, we're not perfect.
[02:07:27.561 --> 02:07:29.062]  It's still enshrined in the film.
[02:07:29.742 --> 02:07:30.862]  Close-ups of the documents.
[02:07:31.323 --> 02:07:34.624]  Going to Larry Pratt, we thought we'd beaten it for the year.
[02:07:36.345 --> 02:07:42.468]  Larry said they could still try to sneak it back sometime in the dead hours before Christmas, as they tend to do.
[02:07:42.528 --> 02:07:46.370]  And we've got a big Supreme Court ruling coming up on the Second Amendment next year.
[02:07:47.077 --> 02:07:49.558]  Larry Pratt is with GunOwners.org.
[02:07:50.158 --> 02:07:55.340]  I keep telling you, listeners, that the media isn't telling you the Second Amendment's under attack.
[02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:56.761]  They've gotten a lot slicker about it.
[02:07:57.441 --> 02:08:01.742]  Now they tell you, hey, we support the Second Amendment, and that means we're going to restrict it.
[02:08:02.683 --> 02:08:06.764]  And they call this a new bill, pro-gun, here in this AFP article.
[02:08:07.845 --> 02:08:11.326]  And so it's a very dark time for the Second Amendment, and the big battle's heating up.
[02:08:11.366 --> 02:08:12.426]  Larry Pratt, thanks for coming on.
[02:08:12.906 --> 02:08:14.527]  Alex, thank you very much for having me on.
[02:08:15.316 --> 02:08:16.838]  Break down exactly what happened, sir.
[02:08:18.019 --> 02:08:24.325]  Well, yesterday afternoon, Schumer prevailed in the United States Senate.
[02:08:24.885 --> 02:08:29.329]  He was able to get this thing through with hardly any changes.
[02:08:30.190 --> 02:08:34.074]  The way it came over from the House, he was able to get it through the Senate.
[02:08:34.334 --> 02:08:35.275]  No recorded vote.
[02:08:36.205 --> 02:08:44.049]  And within minutes, it must have caused a nosebleed for whoever took it over to the House side, because they would have moved so fast.
[02:08:44.549 --> 02:08:51.073]  They got it over there, and it was through the House and on its way to the President, where the doubt was he'll sign it.
[02:08:51.993 --> 02:08:54.715]  And that was all done before the House adjourned.
[02:08:55.535 --> 02:09:03.139]  When I realized that the Senate had approved it, I got a hold of the newly elected Congressman Paul Brown.
[02:09:03.923 --> 02:09:11.689]  Well, I ran into him, I caught up with him, I should say, on the phone at the airport.
[02:09:12.569 --> 02:09:16.893]  And he had no idea that this thing had gone through, nor had I at that time.
[02:09:17.673 --> 02:09:26.800]  And we discussed, bless our hearts, a strategy that we would implement when the House of Representatives got back on January 15 to try to stop it there.
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:29.982]  Well, it had already been put through.
[02:09:30.042 --> 02:09:31.103]  They didn't want any more
[02:09:31.590 --> 02:09:43.013]  Time for debate, any more time for public awareness of just how seriously they have hurt the right to keep and bear arms of so many people, particularly veterans.
[02:09:43.794 --> 02:09:45.754]  And it's just an amazing thing.
[02:09:46.354 --> 02:09:58.438]  The big concession that was arrived at in the United States Senate dealt with, if your name has been put on the list that you can't buy a gun when an instant background check is done,
[02:09:59.791 --> 02:10:05.777]  You'll be able to get your name out of the list, or at least let's put it this way, you'll be able to try.
[02:10:05.837 --> 02:10:19.190]  You'll be able to sue the government and that means you can go pay for a lawyer, you can go pay for a psychiatrist, you can pay for any other expert witnesses that you might need in order to try to get your name out.
[02:10:20.014 --> 02:10:32.408]  Keep in mind, being able to sue the government, that is a special privilege that they have to grant to you, so that was a change, but you will have to prove your innocence.
[02:10:32.588 --> 02:10:39.777]  You will have to prove that you're not mentally defective, which will be the way they're going to be zapping so many of these folks.
[02:10:40.377 --> 02:10:45.679]  You will have to prove beyond... Well, they're now saying troubled, and they're saying any mental disorder.
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:46.360]  Sure.
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:11:01.606]  If they think that you might be a danger to yourself or to others, if you've been so ruled by some psychiatrist or the Veterans Administration, then you're toast, and you're going to have to prove that you're not.
[02:11:03.007 --> 02:11:06.128]  If somebody hasn't had experience dealing with
[02:11:06.668 --> 02:11:20.446]  The court system, it may be difficult to appreciate just how terrible a burden this is, but the reason that we are a different country in terms of our judicial process
[02:11:20.945 --> 02:11:31.951]  What really makes us stand apart from all the non-English speaking countries of the world is that when the government has a beef against you, they have to bring the charges.
[02:11:32.051 --> 02:11:36.373]  They have to prove that you are guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
[02:11:36.413 --> 02:11:44.197]  And that's why the Soviet Union and everybody else love to use psychiatry as a tool against political dissidents because they can just say, in fact they have
[02:11:44.787 --> 02:11:47.369]  There's scores of new designations in the last decade.
[02:11:47.389 --> 02:11:48.510]  There's multiple a year.
[02:11:48.570 --> 02:11:48.771]  Yes.
[02:11:49.051 --> 02:11:51.073]  Where, oh, you don't trust the government.
[02:11:51.673 --> 02:11:58.279]  Oh, you have this disorder where you have opposition to authority.
[02:11:58.620 --> 02:11:59.701]  You're mentally ill.
[02:11:59.761 --> 02:12:01.782]  You believe in a global government conspiracy.
[02:12:01.802 --> 02:12:03.604]  You know, they have mental illnesses for that now.
[02:12:03.904 --> 02:12:05.246]  We're all mentally ill, Larry.
[02:12:05.506 --> 02:12:06.767]  Ron Paul's mentally ill.
[02:12:06.947 --> 02:12:07.247]  Sure.
[02:12:07.468 --> 02:12:10.971]  And the charge itself establishes guilt.
[02:12:11.932 --> 02:12:27.024]  And then you have to prove, and it's not as if you've been accused of having punched somebody in the nose or done something that was a violent crime, which is what used to be the threshold for depriving somebody of the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:12:27.484 --> 02:12:35.410]  No, if you might be a danger, now that charge alone is what puts your rights off limits.
[02:12:35.631 --> 02:12:38.393]  Well, that goes back to your neighbors here yelling and screaming.
[02:12:38.433 --> 02:12:39.133]  They call the cops.
[02:12:39.153 --> 02:12:43.517]  The cops will tell you they're supposed to arrest somebody because they get federal money just for making the arrest.
[02:12:43.537 --> 02:12:44.698]  They don't care if it doesn't stick.
[02:12:45.741 --> 02:12:51.385]  Uh, and you know, now they're talking about verbal things being abusive and getting arrested for yelling at someone.
[02:12:51.405 --> 02:12:57.109]  So, and this goes back to people when they would get a divorce, and on average, the lawyer goes,
[02:12:58.021 --> 02:12:59.142]  All I can say is we need another Congress.
[02:12:59.622 --> 02:13:00.323]  This Congress is clearly
[02:13:23.473 --> 02:13:25.475]  Not interested in going on the record.
[02:13:25.775 --> 02:13:28.197]  They're not interested in protecting the people's liberties.
[02:13:29.038 --> 02:13:30.799]  These guys need to be thrown out.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:41.128]  We are in real trouble and what they're able to do is do these things right at the end of the session and the NRA is there to run cover for them.
[02:13:41.688 --> 02:13:44.350]  And to say that, well, it was a pro-gun measure anyway.
[02:13:44.570 --> 02:13:48.392]  We got the necessary improvements in it to make it so that we liked it.
[02:13:48.633 --> 02:13:51.935]  Well, believe me, they've been pushing this bill all along.
[02:13:52.415 --> 02:14:01.421]  They came out publicly for it as it left the House of Representatives when they got this so-called improvement that you can try to get your name out.
[02:14:02.181 --> 02:14:09.786]  Listen, even if you were somehow able to prove that you were not a danger to yourself and others,
[02:14:10.613 --> 02:14:12.994]  That doesn't mean that your name is going to come out of the list.
[02:14:13.114 --> 02:14:20.457]  They can just fool around and fool around and fool around, and after a year goes by, the bill says you're considered denied.
[02:14:21.197 --> 02:14:23.398]  And so now, no judge, no jury.
[02:14:23.858 --> 02:14:30.280]  They've created kind of an extra-jurisdictional system that doesn't even have judges involved.
[02:14:30.320 --> 02:14:31.461]  Now let's expand on this.
[02:14:32.228 --> 02:14:33.370]  Because you bring up the key here.
[02:14:33.410 --> 02:14:37.995]  The NRA brought in this bill, supported it from the start, when it was even worse.
[02:14:38.576 --> 02:14:42.140]  Now they claim, oh, we took it and fixed it in the Senate.
[02:14:42.521 --> 02:14:47.106]  So now good old boys can say, at least the NRA made it a little better.
[02:14:47.146 --> 02:14:48.889]  They had to compromise.
[02:14:49.429 --> 02:14:52.271]  The NRA is one of the most powerful lobbies in this country.
[02:14:52.291 --> 02:14:54.052]  If they wanted this thing dead, it would have been dead.
[02:14:54.393 --> 02:14:55.453]  They laid the egg.
[02:14:55.533 --> 02:14:57.175]  They fed the baby.
[02:14:57.535 --> 02:14:59.056]  They took care of this little creature.
[02:15:00.277 --> 02:15:04.720]  Larry, you guys have finally, Gunners of America, done the right thing and I appreciate it because you've been really
[02:15:05.370 --> 02:15:08.372]  You know, really above the fray and gentlemanly about it.
[02:15:08.712 --> 02:15:13.654]  You've written an open letter to gun owners laying out the history that the NRA is a bunch of gun grabbers.
[02:15:13.694 --> 02:15:15.755]  I don't mean the members, but the leadership.
[02:15:16.115 --> 02:15:20.878]  Recap that for people so they can understand what it's going to take to get back on the offensive.
[02:15:21.138 --> 02:15:24.860]  Because as long as Judas Iscariot is our leader, we're going to lose.
[02:15:25.825 --> 02:15:29.306]  Yeah, you don't want Benedict Arnold remaining as your general.
[02:15:31.587 --> 02:15:37.930]  Carol McCarthy, as far as this latest defeat is concerned, called it.
[02:15:37.970 --> 02:15:41.791]  She said, this bill would not have moved had it not been for the NRA.
[02:15:41.991 --> 02:15:43.432]  I think those are her exact words.
[02:15:44.032 --> 02:15:49.234]  But this is something that's been on the NRA's mind from the very beginning, and according to their own
[02:15:49.833 --> 02:15:50.654]  We're good to go.
[02:15:58.682 --> 02:16:08.986]  That the NRA has, from its very beginning in 1872, supported reasonable and effective, I think were the two adjectives he used, gun control.
[02:16:10.206 --> 02:16:14.508]  So, obviously, they think the Brady Instant Check is effective.
[02:16:14.548 --> 02:16:22.911]  They think that because people on many occasions are kept from buying a gun at a store, that somehow that keeps criminals from getting guns.
[02:16:24.435 --> 02:16:28.799]  Excuse me, how does that work in England when there really aren't any more stores left?
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:36.766]  If you're not a farmer wanting to buy a single shot shotgun or a hunter wanting to buy a bolt-action single shot rifle,
[02:16:38.136 --> 02:16:39.517]  You're not going to get a gun in England.
[02:16:39.537 --> 02:16:45.824]  And by the way, that's got to stay at the local hunting lodge and be locked up and you have to have some person over you.
[02:16:46.184 --> 02:16:49.348]  No, in fact, their crime rate exploded after they banned the guns.
[02:16:49.808 --> 02:16:50.169]  It did.
[02:16:50.189 --> 02:16:51.350]  It has exploded.
[02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:52.792]  It continues to explode.
[02:16:53.152 --> 02:16:55.835]  All the while the British pistol team in the Olympics
[02:16:56.895 --> 02:17:00.436]  They have to fly over to Belgium in order to practice.
[02:17:00.837 --> 02:17:05.378]  That's how draconian the gun ban is, and yet crime did explode.
[02:17:05.778 --> 02:17:13.061]  What in the world are we smoking that makes us think that the Brady Instant Check is going to keep guns out of the wrong hands?
[02:17:13.141 --> 02:17:14.521]  Well, Larry Pratt, you know that.
[02:17:14.561 --> 02:17:15.942]  You know the government and the media.
[02:17:15.982 --> 02:17:17.422]  It's about enslaving the people.
[02:17:17.702 --> 02:17:19.283]  They know it's not about keeping us safe.
[02:17:19.743 --> 02:17:23.264]  The problem is even gun owners seem to share this happy notion
[02:17:23.684 --> 02:17:26.605]  That if we pass a law, that'll keep bad things from happening.
[02:17:28.186 --> 02:17:30.346]  Well, gun owners think the NRA is pro-gun.
[02:17:30.366 --> 02:17:33.027]  They don't know that it literally is the father of gun control.
[02:17:33.047 --> 02:17:35.408]  The progenitor of all of our nightmares.
[02:17:36.008 --> 02:17:37.529]  They just can't understand it.
[02:17:38.089 --> 02:17:38.829]  Well, get ready!
[02:17:40.069 --> 02:17:44.031]  You were given a post-traumatic stress disorder designation 20 years ago.
[02:17:44.091 --> 02:17:44.691]  No more guns.
[02:17:46.135 --> 02:17:51.121]  Ted Anders from Midas December 20th 2007 gold 797 10 ounce gold coins can be purchased for $821.20 $404.75 for half $202.38 for quarter that's $821.20 $404.75 and $202.38
[02:18:00.074 --> 02:18:03.356]  For years, Ron Paul has taken the position to uphold constitutional rights.
[02:18:03.676 --> 02:18:07.858]  He's been branded by special interest groups as doctrinal, refusing to bend his values.
[02:18:08.238 --> 02:18:12.221]  I can only imagine the pressure applied by Congress as he stands alone for these principles.
[02:18:12.601 --> 02:18:14.422]  He has given up a medical career for this.
[02:18:14.922 --> 02:18:16.603]  Ron Paul is running for president.
[02:18:16.903 --> 02:18:22.887]  The ideas of strong currency ending the war, defending the Constitution, and protecting civil liberties are catching on.
[02:18:23.167 --> 02:18:29.952]  As a thank you, GCNlive.com, Midas Resources, and I would like to send you a free copy of the Ron Paul Family Cookbook.
[02:18:30.272 --> 02:18:31.153]  Call 800-686-2237 for your free copy.
[02:18:31.173 --> 02:18:31.473]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:31.493 --> 02:18:34.515]  I hope his values are touching your heart as deep as they are mine.
[02:18:34.655 --> 02:18:34.976]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:35.036 --> 02:18:36.637]  Thanks again for supporting Ron Paul.
[02:18:45.928 --> 02:18:47.609]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[02:18:47.870 --> 02:18:49.571]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[02:18:49.751 --> 02:18:53.774]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[02:18:53.974 --> 02:18:57.017]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[02:18:57.197 --> 02:19:01.040]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:03.562]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[02:19:03.682 --> 02:19:09.987]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices, restaurants, retail, warehouses, construction, and more.
[02:19:10.087 --> 02:19:15.791]  TWRadios.com is the Internet's leading two-way radio provider, with same-day shipping on top name
[02:19:15.811 --> 02:19:16.271]  We're good to go.
[02:19:47.202 --> 02:19:50.984]  As the old saying goes, if you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.
[02:19:51.164 --> 02:19:56.667]  But if you give him a Berkey system, you give him the ability to obtain purified water for a lifetime.
[02:19:56.987 --> 02:20:02.090]  This year, when giving Christmas gifts, instead of unwanted trinkets, give a meaningful and substantial gift.
[02:20:02.390 --> 02:20:07.372]  Berkey systems are ideal for every member of your family, especially the young ones in college.
[02:20:07.612 --> 02:20:11.193]  Unlike other water filtration systems, Berkey purifiers are portable.
[02:20:11.233 --> 02:20:15.534]  They require no plumbing, and the elements don't have to be replaced every four to six months.
[02:20:15.954 --> 02:20:22.377]  Perfect for anyone on a tight budget, and more importantly, if there's an unexpected emergency, your loved ones will be prepared.
[02:20:22.717 --> 02:20:26.478]  That's because Berkey systems are able to purify raw, untreated water.
[02:20:26.898 --> 02:20:29.699]  Check out our Christmas specials at Berkeywater.com.
[02:20:29.839 --> 02:20:35.501]  With one of our quantity specials, you not only get a discount, but at month's top, you can get gifts for the entire family.
[02:20:35.521 --> 02:20:37.502]  That's Berkeywater.com or call 888-03-4438.
[02:20:37.522 --> 02:20:37.862]  That's 888-03-4438.
[02:20:44.659 --> 02:20:48.901]  The holidays are here, and that means extra food and extra weight gain.
[02:20:49.061 --> 02:20:51.603]  Why not make your New Year's resolution to eat healthier?
[02:20:51.803 --> 02:20:56.545]  And the easiest and most delicious way to start is with your new Excalibur Dehydrator.
[02:20:56.565 --> 02:21:00.747]  The Excalibur Dehydrator makes eating healthy not only easy, but fun.
[02:21:00.847 --> 02:21:04.169]  You can use it with your favorite fruit, vegetables, fish, and meat.
[02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:10.196]  And the Excalibur Dehydrator cuts out the unnecessary salt, fat, and preservatives found in most grocery store foods.
[02:21:10.396 --> 02:21:16.263]  You can also use the Excalibur Dehydrator to make your own herbs and spices in the comfort of your own kitchen.
[02:21:16.383 --> 02:21:18.605]  It's so easy your whole family can use it.
[02:21:18.785 --> 02:21:22.690]  Oh, and don't forget, the Excalibur Dehydrator makes the perfect Christmas gift.
[02:21:22.890 --> 02:21:23.471]  I was a highway man.
[02:21:53.183 --> 02:22:21.668]  Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her marbles to nitrate Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five But I am still alive
[02:22:22.583 --> 02:22:24.044]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:27.266 --> 02:22:29.247]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:22:29.267 --> 02:22:30.007]  to 2 p.m.
[02:22:30.047 --> 02:22:31.888]  Central Time, that's 12 and 3 p.m.
[02:22:31.929 --> 02:22:36.511]  Eastern, defending a republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:22:36.751 --> 02:22:51.620]  The attack on the Second Amendment on gun dealers, on gun shops, on gun shows, on gun owners, on the size of the BATF, on importation, on ammo, at the federal, state level, lawsuits,
[02:22:53.121 --> 02:22:53.661]  I track it.
[02:22:53.681 --> 02:22:56.523]  I go to gunowners.org and I track it.
[02:22:56.983 --> 02:23:00.926]  And you notice the last three or four months, I went out and I started getting Larry Pratt on a bunch.
[02:23:00.966 --> 02:23:01.706]  I put links up.
[02:23:02.406 --> 02:23:04.087]  I said, folks, the attack is on.
[02:23:04.307 --> 02:23:06.429]  I guess you think I'm just saying that for fun.
[02:23:06.449 --> 02:23:13.793]  And we're not going to see the repercussions in the next couple of years as this is implemented, but the big thing is next year, the Supreme Court
[02:23:14.989 --> 02:23:16.251]  And don't think they're not political.
[02:23:16.271 --> 02:23:19.034]  We've got to put pressure on the Republicans, the Democrats, all of them.
[02:23:19.414 --> 02:23:23.458]  We've got to tell Congress to supersede the Supreme Court if they rule.
[02:23:24.440 --> 02:23:26.762]  And again, it'll be something like this.
[02:23:27.523 --> 02:23:31.027]  Oh, you've got a Second Amendment right, but it can be curtailed by law.
[02:23:31.427 --> 02:23:31.968]  Under law.
[02:23:32.933 --> 02:23:36.375]  And then they come in with laws saying, well, we can curtail you.
[02:23:36.816 --> 02:23:38.557]  That'll be hailed as pro-gun.
[02:23:38.577 --> 02:23:40.318]  It'll actually be a death knell.
[02:23:40.678 --> 02:23:43.160]  Larry Pratt, do you agree with that analysis that we're facing that danger?
[02:23:43.900 --> 02:23:45.821]  That's what is actually happening.
[02:23:45.881 --> 02:23:51.545]  That's what the passage of the McCarthy-Schumer bill yesterday was all about.
[02:23:51.565 --> 02:23:54.747]  It was another step in that very direction that you're talking about.
[02:23:55.473 --> 02:23:58.114]  And it was hailed as a pro-gun measure.
[02:23:58.134 --> 02:23:59.574]  It's rather ironic.
[02:23:59.614 --> 02:24:05.116]  If you go to the NRA website, you'll see them celebrating all the wonderful things that the bill does.
[02:24:05.436 --> 02:24:14.238]  If you go to the Brady campaign website, you'll see them congratulating the Congress for having passed their piece of gun control.
[02:24:14.678 --> 02:24:16.299]  Now, who's mistaken?
[02:24:17.635 --> 02:24:21.598]  You know, that ought to just make everybody ask a question.
[02:24:21.999 --> 02:24:25.702]  How in the world can Yin and Yang both be the same?
[02:24:26.022 --> 02:24:28.284]  No, they're both Yang.
[02:24:28.464 --> 02:24:29.104]  You're the Yin.
[02:24:30.045 --> 02:24:32.047]  They are both anti-gun.
[02:24:32.767 --> 02:24:33.828]  I'm going to put the call out again.
[02:24:33.848 --> 02:24:36.710]  You've got an online bookstore at gunowners.org.
[02:24:37.171 --> 02:24:38.392]  This is excellent materials.
[02:24:38.552 --> 02:24:39.573]  You've got membership.
[02:24:39.853 --> 02:24:41.414]  A yearly membership is very inexpensive.
[02:24:41.494 --> 02:24:42.495]  I suggest a lifetime.
[02:24:42.975 --> 02:24:44.937]  You need the capital to lobby and fight.
[02:24:46.120 --> 02:24:50.342]  You've held back so much, and you're the only national gun group we've got.
[02:24:51.863 --> 02:24:54.484]  We've got JPFO coming up there, Greg, but more of a think tank.
[02:24:55.685 --> 02:24:59.847]  I'm going to put the call out again for people to support you, Larry, or maybe they just want to go ahead and roll over.
[02:25:00.588 --> 02:25:03.889]  Give out the toll-free number of people to call and become members, or tell folks about the bookstore.
[02:25:04.369 --> 02:25:08.512]  Well, the toll-free number is 888-6GUNS.
[02:25:08.632 --> 02:25:12.594]  That's 888-886 and then G-U-N-S.
[02:25:13.134 --> 02:25:15.335]  If they go to GunOwners.org, they can go down and
[02:25:15.776 --> 02:25:29.406]  They'll see a tab for our foundation, which is where the bookstore is, and books that I've written, books that John Lott, the great scholar about, well, one of his books says it all, More Guns, Less Crime.
[02:25:30.567 --> 02:25:32.288]  Stuff on the history of the Second Amendment.
[02:25:32.368 --> 02:25:39.794]  And I know the audience knows that, but your mother, your father, your neighbor, your son, your daughter, we have to go convert people, or we're going to lose it, folks!
[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:51.609]  Because the schools are certainly going against us with this insane, it's worse than insane, with this evil zero tolerance business.
[02:25:51.989 --> 02:25:54.991]  Well, it's like you bring a plastic knife to cut your food and you get arrested.
[02:25:55.232 --> 02:26:00.456]  Well, yeah, this little girl, about ten years old, took a piece of steak and a steak knife
[02:26:01.136 --> 02:26:07.741]  to school and she was caught cutting the steak with her knife and for that she was charged with a felony.
[02:26:07.941 --> 02:26:10.283]  Well, they charge them with felonies now for playing tag.
[02:26:10.303 --> 02:26:10.944]  You didn't know that?
[02:26:12.045 --> 02:26:12.445]  I'm sure.
[02:26:12.465 --> 02:26:13.466]  No, no, they call it assault.
[02:26:13.566 --> 02:26:14.406]  I'm not kidding, Larry.
[02:26:15.307 --> 02:26:16.428]  Give them a toll-free number.
[02:26:16.448 --> 02:26:23.273]  I mean, if anybody wants to aid the only real gun group we've got, I mean, I'm telling you it's coming down, Larry.
[02:26:23.714 --> 02:26:24.454]  It's coming down.
[02:26:24.654 --> 02:26:25.595]  It's a triple-8.
[02:26:26.916 --> 02:26:27.597]  Let me start again.
[02:26:27.637 --> 02:26:28.697]  Sorry, I had a frog in my throat.
[02:26:28.717 --> 02:26:28.737]  888-886
[02:26:31.187 --> 02:26:34.368]  G-U-N-S, triple eight, double eight, six guns.
[02:26:35.709 --> 02:26:40.331]  Again, for folks that missed it, that's 888-886-GUNS.
[02:26:40.651 --> 02:26:41.071]  That's it.
[02:26:41.091 --> 02:26:45.573]  888-886-GUNS, or gunowners.org.
[02:26:45.593 --> 02:26:48.295]  At least go sign up for the free legislative updates.
[02:26:48.395 --> 02:26:49.355]  Call those phone numbers.
[02:26:49.795 --> 02:26:53.497]  Will it do any good to call the White House and tell that gun grabber not to sign this?
[02:26:54.272 --> 02:26:59.595]  Well, I don't think we should say nothing could help, so please go ahead and do that.
[02:27:00.956 --> 02:27:12.062]  I think it's frankly going to be a hard sell, but he ought to hear from the folks, because if he doesn't hear from anybody, then he'll use that as a justification for what he ends up doing.
[02:27:13.183 --> 02:27:16.285]  Well, we need to target every member of Congress that went for this and get them out.
[02:27:16.825 --> 02:27:18.406]  Republican, Democrat, it doesn't matter.
[02:27:18.466 --> 02:27:19.627]  We need to get them out of office, don't we?
[02:27:20.405 --> 02:27:25.590]  Yeah, I think we need a wholesale cleaning and this will be a chance to do it in 2008.
[02:27:26.131 --> 02:27:28.073]  Larry Pratt, have a great Christmas.
[02:27:28.113 --> 02:27:28.834]  Thank you for the time.
[02:27:29.094 --> 02:27:30.095]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:27:30.135 --> 02:27:33.979]  We'll be right back with Aaron Zellman of Jews to Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[02:27:36.502 --> 02:27:39.505]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.525 --> 02:27:43.129]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.593 --> 02:27:48.434]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:27:48.574 --> 02:27:53.737]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:27:53.757 --> 02:27:55.278]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:27:55.538 --> 02:28:03.703]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:28:03.943 --> 02:28:09.667]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:28:09.827 --> 02:28:11.608]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:28:11.668 --> 02:28:13.810]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:28:13.970 --> 02:28:18.253]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:28:18.393 --> 02:28:20.515]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:28:20.615 --> 02:28:28.461]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[02:28:32.966 --> 02:28:34.527]  Heart and Body Extract 866-295-5305 or hbextract.com.
[02:28:34.607 --> 02:28:36.730]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network.
[02:28:49.742 --> 02:28:53.063]  Let's ask the question that the Bush regime hopes you will never ask.
[02:28:53.444 --> 02:28:56.365]  That is, is the USA already bankrupt?
[02:28:56.645 --> 02:29:03.007]  As the world's biggest debtor nation, we are borrowing in excess of 80% of the world's net savings.
[02:29:03.107 --> 02:29:07.529]  That's $2 billion per day to finance the biggest deficit in history.
[02:29:07.749 --> 02:29:12.111]  Our creditors are becoming increasingly concerned that the debt can never be repaid.
[02:29:12.271 --> 02:29:17.633]  Japan and China, two of the largest holders of US debt, are looking to greatly reduce their exposure to dollars.
[02:29:18.113 --> 02:29:20.656]  In fact, China has privately hinted that a U.S.
[02:29:20.696 --> 02:29:24.959]  attack on Iran could result in China's dumping massive amounts of U.S.
[02:29:25.020 --> 02:29:25.880]  Treasury bonds.
[02:29:26.141 --> 02:29:30.765]  To find out more about this, call for a free report on the coming dollar collapse.
[02:29:30.945 --> 02:29:32.586]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[02:29:32.606 --> 02:29:34.188]  That's 1-8888-XANADU or 1-8888-XANADU and ask for George.
[02:29:45.660 --> 02:29:46.321]  It's a fact.
[02:29:46.541 --> 02:29:54.006]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:29:54.146 --> 02:30:03.012]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:30:03.272 --> 02:30:13.819]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:30:14.079 --> 02:30:20.141]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:30:20.361 --> 02:30:25.383]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:30:25.563 --> 02:30:30.045]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:30:30.205 --> 02:30:32.005]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:30:32.065 --> 02:30:32.326]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:30:32.346 --> 02:30:32.766]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:30:32.866 --> 02:30:34.686]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:30:41.929 --> 02:30:44.930]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[02:30:44.950 --> 02:31:10.900]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus
[02:31:12.089 --> 02:31:32.044]  On the thing The only thing that's real The needle tears a hole The old familiar sting Try to kill it
[02:31:33.377 --> 02:31:41.580]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:44.901]  Thank you for joining us today.
[02:31:45.241 --> 02:31:49.203]  It's still not too late to give the gift of truth this Christmas, this holiday.

[02:32:38.235 --> 02:32:41.156]  And then let me give you the Christmas present, because I know my audience is so honest.
[02:32:41.616 --> 02:32:42.977]  You can use the same passcode.
[02:32:43.641 --> 02:32:43.901]  I think so.
[02:33:06.229 --> 02:33:06.910]  We're good to go.
[02:33:25.553 --> 02:33:27.936]  The Globalists are pulling out all the stops.
[02:33:27.956 --> 02:33:28.237]  They are
[02:33:44.111 --> 02:33:46.492]  Saying torture's good, secret arrest is good.
[02:33:46.552 --> 02:33:58.295]  Yeah, we're spying on Bin Laden, and the next week, yeah, we've been spying on you for decades, no warrants, and yeah, the NSA took over every major phone company in 96 and has whole offices in each phone company.
[02:33:58.936 --> 02:34:09.239]  And yeah, we've got face-scanning cameras going in from Dallas to New York, in the schools, we're reading your lips, we're recording everything you say, AI computers are chronicling for keywords, live time,
[02:34:10.139 --> 02:34:11.940]  Uh, the Pentagon put in the plan.
[02:34:11.980 --> 02:34:13.720]  Yeah, the troops are trying to take your guns.
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:15.541]  Yeah, they're building FEMA camps.
[02:34:16.401 --> 02:34:26.304]  And then, sure, we're going to go ahead and say anybody who's ever had any type of mental illness or even any mental designation that they've handed out to over 100 million Americans, you can't own guns anymore.
[02:34:27.310 --> 02:34:28.851]  Military, police, you name it.
[02:34:29.392 --> 02:34:32.054]  And then now the Supreme Court's going to rule on the Second Amendment.
[02:34:32.074 --> 02:34:36.598]  And you watch, they'll say it's pro-gun, but they'll say you got a right unless prescribed by law.
[02:34:37.038 --> 02:34:38.399]  And that'll actually be anti-gun.
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:40.862]  So the ultimate attack is now on.
[02:34:41.382 --> 02:34:42.923]  Republicans won't tell you about it.
[02:34:44.304 --> 02:34:45.686]  NRA is behind it all.
[02:34:46.566 --> 02:34:48.508]  Now there's one big national gun group.
[02:34:48.548 --> 02:34:50.109]  That's gunowners.org.
[02:34:50.129 --> 02:34:50.970]  We just had them on.
[02:34:51.430 --> 02:34:53.372]  Now a hardcore think tank group.
[02:34:53.432 --> 02:34:55.594]  Group's got a lot of members that does lobby as well.
[02:34:56.269 --> 02:35:04.894]  And that's JPFO, Jews Preservation of Firearms Ownership, and their director, Aaron Zellman, is our guest, also a documentary filmmaker and author in his own right.
[02:35:04.914 --> 02:35:07.975]  Some of their books and materials are also on the Gun Owners website.
[02:35:08.456 --> 02:35:10.056]  Aaron Zellman, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:35:10.677 --> 02:35:11.257]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:35:11.297 --> 02:35:12.438]  It's good to talk to you again.
[02:35:12.878 --> 02:35:18.581]  We are, uh, it just gets worse and worse by the minute, but the enemy's gotten more stealthy now.
[02:35:18.641 --> 02:35:22.723]  Instead of just saying they want to disarm us, they say, oh no, it's pro-gun, and do it.
[02:35:23.083 --> 02:35:24.004]  Break down what's happened.
[02:35:25.703 --> 02:35:46.041]  Well, if you take a look at this particular bill today that was passed, this travesty, this was a combined effort between the NRA and Carol McCarthy and Charlie Schumer to appear to be doing something good, but in reality it brings about a great deal of evil.
[02:35:47.262 --> 02:35:52.166]  I'll just give you one example that has really concerned me for many months since this bill was introduced.
[02:35:54.093 --> 02:36:04.978]  If someone is considered to have a mental health problem of some sort, I haven't seen a clear definition of what a mental health problem is.
[02:36:06.058 --> 02:36:09.800]  Does that mean somebody who was depressed for a week because there was a death in the family?
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:12.141]  They got a few pills from their doctor?
[02:36:12.801 --> 02:36:14.342]  Or does it mean something much more severe?
[02:36:16.293 --> 02:36:18.695]  Well, we've actually heard them in the debate say what it is.
[02:36:19.196 --> 02:36:22.899]  When you've had a cesarean section or been in a car wreck, they come up and ask you questionnaires.
[02:36:22.979 --> 02:36:23.700]  Are you depressed?
[02:36:24.080 --> 02:36:26.923]  They use that to have CPS grab your shoulder and you don't even know it.
[02:36:27.483 --> 02:36:29.245]  But they're also saying they're going to use that.
[02:36:29.265 --> 02:36:36.732]  No, they say any, if you've ever been on medication, any designation, that they are going to, you know, if they feel like it, say no gun.
[02:36:37.752 --> 02:36:39.414]  Well, let's take this one step forward.
[02:36:40.055 --> 02:36:40.375]  Because
[02:36:41.451 --> 02:36:55.179]  Yeah, you said no gun, but this really opens a door for the ATF to come smashing the door down, actually, in your home, because let's say you owned guns prior to someone saying you have a mental health issue.
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:36:57.821]  Well, that means you can't keep the guns you have.
[02:36:59.942 --> 02:37:05.546]  So this will give a whole new emphasis to ATF to justify their budget and their thuggery.
[02:37:05.606 --> 02:37:07.467]  Well, that's why they tripled in size, yeah.
[02:37:08.467 --> 02:37:11.029]  And that's why they have a billion-dollar-a-year budget and growing.
[02:37:12.092 --> 02:37:27.851]  And so I think that this bill, that this treachery on behalf of the NRA and the usual group of gun haters, should be a red flag to everybody who's listening to your program, that the battle has started.
[02:37:28.872 --> 02:37:31.055]  The battle to destroy the Second Amendment
[02:37:31.590 --> 02:37:34.311]  The war on guns isn't full force.
[02:37:51.475 --> 02:37:58.741]  I mean, at every level, Schwarzenegger passing this thing where they've got a stamp on all the bullets, that'll cause that to be adopted nationwide.
[02:37:59.061 --> 02:38:01.263]  So you have the same analysis.
[02:38:01.303 --> 02:38:02.103]  This is the big one.
[02:38:02.423 --> 02:38:06.426]  The battle of Armageddon for the Second Amendment has begun?
[02:38:07.307 --> 02:38:07.928]  Absolutely.
[02:38:07.948 --> 02:38:18.055]  In fact, we did a mailing about a month ago to our membership, telling our members that it won't make any difference who wins election, the presidential election, assuming we still have one.
[02:38:21.639 --> 02:38:22.339]  We have enemies.
[02:38:23.360 --> 02:38:25.342]  I don't think Ron Paul's going to win, by the way.
[02:38:25.362 --> 02:38:32.650]  That's probably going to upset some people, but the reality of the situation is that whoever gets in the White House is going to be our enemy.
[02:38:35.793 --> 02:38:44.482]  The Supreme Court, by the way, I think will prove to be our enemy, because they may decide to say, well, yes, you have a right to gun ownership, but
[02:38:45.137 --> 02:38:47.059]  The government has a right to regulate.
[02:38:47.579 --> 02:38:49.421]  Yeah, that's what they're going to say, and then it's all over.
[02:38:49.941 --> 02:38:58.068]  It's all over with, because the regulation could also include taxation.
[02:38:58.088 --> 02:39:00.650]  $200 a year, but you buy your machine guns, $200.
[02:39:01.430 --> 02:39:11.479]  But suppose they decide to have a yearly tax on guns, and they'll probably say also for ammunition, because they'll accuse that of being part of the global warming problem.
[02:39:12.219 --> 02:39:13.080]  Every time you have a
[02:39:13.635 --> 02:39:16.540]  The gun discharging of a carbon footprint, so they will say.
[02:39:17.421 --> 02:39:18.904]  So yeah, the battle is on.
[02:39:18.984 --> 02:39:28.099]  And anybody who thinks, well, now we're going to win the day and things are going to turn out okay, they need to take an anti-naive pill.
[02:39:30.071 --> 02:39:33.673]  You know, I totally agree with you, and I can see it in all their actions.
[02:39:33.733 --> 02:39:34.374]  It's not just that.
[02:39:34.414 --> 02:39:35.234]  It's the borders.
[02:39:36.015 --> 02:39:36.835]  It's the wars.
[02:39:36.915 --> 02:39:37.656]  It's everything.
[02:39:38.016 --> 02:39:50.124]  The establishment now doesn't care if 90 plus percent are against the NAFTA highway, or if 90 plus percent are against open borders, or if 80 percent are against a war, or if 75 percent are against gun control.
[02:39:50.484 --> 02:39:51.825]  They just don't care now.
[02:39:51.885 --> 02:39:55.107]  They just say, sit down, shut up, we're doing it.
[02:39:55.928 --> 02:39:59.249]  Well, they're even smarter than that.
[02:39:59.289 --> 02:40:04.372]  If you'll notice, this entire piece of legislation was passed on a voice vote.
[02:40:05.512 --> 02:40:09.954]  There is no record of who voted for this travesty.
[02:40:11.195 --> 02:40:14.916]  And the NRA was delighted to have it handled that way.
[02:40:16.917 --> 02:40:20.659]  So we have a record of the NRA committing this, having a helping hand.
[02:40:21.832 --> 02:40:23.794]  In destroying the Second Amendment today.
[02:40:23.914 --> 02:40:29.880]  We don't have a record of which of these criminals in Congress voted.
[02:40:30.020 --> 02:40:31.822]  I'm not sure how they voted.
[02:40:32.282 --> 02:40:44.374]  My assumption is that every single person in Congress voted for it, and they're all a bunch of criminals, and if people don't wake up in the United States and smell the coffee, it's going to be over with before they can blink their eyes.
[02:40:45.245 --> 02:40:49.226]  But see, the enemy in the past would admit they wanted our guns and admit they were coming.
[02:40:49.526 --> 02:40:50.666]  Now they've gotten slick.
[02:40:50.706 --> 02:40:51.927]  They just deny everything.
[02:40:52.247 --> 02:40:55.808]  Or they mislabel anti-gun as it gets as pro-gun.
[02:40:55.828 --> 02:40:56.908]  Yeah, of course.
[02:40:57.588 --> 02:40:57.888]  Of course.
[02:40:58.088 --> 02:41:00.949]  You know, last year I was in a gun shop buying a shotgun.
[02:41:01.669 --> 02:41:03.450]  And it's the big one, McBride's here in town.
[02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:07.931]  And this guy walks over from behind the counter and he goes, I don't appreciate you saying bushes.
[02:41:08.666 --> 02:41:10.407]  Well, first of all, I have to correct you on one thing, Alex.
[02:41:10.427 --> 02:41:11.368]  You're saying these guys think.
[02:41:11.408 --> 02:41:12.749]  First of all, they don't think.
[02:41:12.769 --> 02:41:13.130]  They believe.
[02:41:13.170 --> 02:41:14.310]  So people who believe that we're wrong,
[02:41:38.399 --> 02:41:38.680]  Thank you.
[02:41:50.357 --> 02:41:57.039]  I just hope they love the Second Amendment more than the stupid Republican Party and their W stickers and their NRA memberships.
[02:41:57.059 --> 02:41:59.620]  You know, my battle plan is to destroy the NRA.
[02:42:00.161 --> 02:42:07.943]  They are a larcenous group who pose as pro-gun while, I've got the whole history, always pushing the 68, the 33,
[02:42:10.624 --> 02:42:12.405]  They're always behind everything.
[02:42:12.465 --> 02:42:13.485]  They're the Judas Code.
[02:42:13.865 --> 02:42:15.026]  And really, you've got to have that.
[02:42:15.046 --> 02:42:21.988]  If you've got 160 million gun owners, and you're trying to fool them into oblivion, you've got to have some group posing as their saviors, don't you?
[02:42:23.088 --> 02:42:34.612]  Well, that's true, but I would like to tell people on the front page of our website at JPFO.org, there is a section that says that JPFO and NRA have different views on the BATFE.
[02:42:36.067 --> 02:42:43.290]  And the NRA sent a letter to one of our members making it very clear they oppose abolishing the ATF.
[02:42:44.030 --> 02:42:45.851]  We have that letter posted on our site.
[02:42:46.351 --> 02:42:47.571]  People need to go read that.
[02:42:48.052 --> 02:42:50.652]  And we have our four-page response to their letter.
[02:42:51.273 --> 02:42:52.553]  People need to read that too.
[02:42:53.754 --> 02:42:57.235]  But the NRA is on record as opposing abolishing
[02:42:57.987 --> 02:43:00.789]  The most criminal organization in America, the ATF.
[02:43:01.009 --> 02:43:10.356]  And by the way, the controlled corporate media that poses as liberal always attacks the NRA, knowing that that fools conservatives into thinking, oh, they must be good.
[02:43:10.376 --> 02:43:15.260]  Just like they attack Huckabee for a cross behind him and, oh, is it okay to be Christian?
[02:43:15.280 --> 02:43:16.841]  And then Christians go, of course it is!
[02:43:17.161 --> 02:43:19.343]  This is all base manipulation, isn't it, Aaron?
[02:43:19.863 --> 02:43:22.425]  Well, I'd call it a gentleman's agreement of the worst kind.
[02:43:23.877 --> 02:43:26.799]  Well, what's your battle plan, Aaron Zellman of JPFO.org?
[02:43:26.959 --> 02:43:29.360]  What should we do to have any chance?
[02:43:29.400 --> 02:43:32.922]  Because I see... I mean, this is devastating what's happened.
[02:43:32.942 --> 02:43:35.223]  I mean, the incoming... nukes are incoming.
[02:43:36.984 --> 02:43:38.825]  They're screaming back in on re-entry.
[02:43:39.185 --> 02:43:41.986]  The public's running around, you know, playing patty cake.
[02:43:44.027 --> 02:43:47.889]  Well, there's a number of things JPFO has been trying to do, and we're going to continue doing them.
[02:43:48.029 --> 02:43:49.610]  One, we've been trying to educate people.
[02:43:50.373 --> 02:43:53.838]  About how gun control does not belong in a civilized society.
[02:43:54.498 --> 02:43:56.901]  That's through the film that you've been selling for.
[02:43:56.921 --> 02:43:58.303]  It's called Innocence Betrayed.
[02:43:58.323 --> 02:44:01.988]  Showing the connection between gun registration and confiscation.
[02:44:02.692 --> 02:44:07.936]  Well, I think that it's time then for people to say they're not going to put up with it anymore.
[02:44:07.976 --> 02:44:11.178]  As an educational group, we can't tell people how to vote or not vote.
[02:44:31.317 --> 02:44:38.420]  But surely someone out there can put two and two together and realize that they've got to do something different for this coming election.
[02:44:39.260 --> 02:44:41.941]  That's about as far as I can go on that issue, please understand.
[02:44:42.802 --> 02:44:49.164]  One of the things that we've been trying to reach people on also is the criminality of a government agency known as the ATF.
[02:44:49.764 --> 02:44:51.545]  And we have a new film out called The Gang.
[02:44:52.386 --> 02:45:00.909]  And The Gang chronicles and documents how damn criminal this agency is and how this information should be brought forward to every
[02:45:01.357 --> 02:45:02.057]  I don't know.
[02:45:18.777 --> 02:45:22.219]  And I think it's not just JPFO's game plan, it's got to be everybody's game plan.
[02:45:22.499 --> 02:45:23.600]  Well, we know what happened.
[02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:29.483]  We kicked their hind in the last five, six years in gun control in a thousand different running battles.
[02:45:29.883 --> 02:45:36.047]  And so they went underground, beefed up their regulation system, started going after guns on the regulatory side.
[02:45:36.447 --> 02:45:38.789]  And the gun owners' grips will tell you it's been worse than ever.
[02:45:39.189 --> 02:45:41.090]  And now they're launching their big salvos.
[02:45:41.710 --> 02:45:47.834]  I mean, what do we do when the Supreme Court comes out and exactly, it'll be held as pro-gun, it'll say, you've got a right,
[02:45:48.394 --> 02:45:50.755]  And that right is for us to have those handed over.
[02:45:50.775 --> 02:45:54.397]  You know, you've got a right to own a gun, but we get to regulate it, and then it's over.
[02:45:54.437 --> 02:45:55.178]  It's New York City.
[02:45:55.638 --> 02:45:56.658]  Well, then there is no right.
[02:45:58.019 --> 02:45:59.180]  You don't regulate a right.
[02:45:59.740 --> 02:46:03.522]  So, I think they will show their hands that they've been dishonest.
[02:46:04.242 --> 02:46:11.326]  But again, I fear that there are just an awful lot of gun owners in America, Alex, who just are fast asleep.
[02:46:11.386 --> 02:46:12.306]  I call them quackers.
[02:46:13.507 --> 02:46:17.369]  They're more interested in going duck hunting than they are in preserving the Second Amendment.
[02:46:19.568 --> 02:46:20.149]  Yeah, they don't.
[02:46:21.090 --> 02:46:29.457]  And frankly, a lot of gun owners have become our enemy because they're just so fast asleep, or to put it bluntly, incredibly stupid.
[02:46:31.219 --> 02:46:32.560]  You know, I don't think they understand.
[02:46:32.640 --> 02:46:36.884]  It's not just about losing their quack hunting gun, their 10 gauge.
[02:46:37.445 --> 02:46:39.727]  What happens, Aaron, when governments take guns?
[02:46:40.848 --> 02:46:44.732]  Well, as we've shown people, you know, in our film, Innocence Betrayed,
[02:46:46.641 --> 02:47:02.212]  Uh, when governments take guns, they're able to demonize a group of people, they're able to determine if that group of people will live or die, and they're able to control the entire society because no one can resist effectively.
[02:47:04.213 --> 02:47:13.439]  I think, and I think assuming that there's going to be some computer genius working within the government that's going to pull the right plug at the right time and shut the government down.
[02:47:13.459 --> 02:47:15.281]  I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:47:15.301 --> 02:47:17.522]  There'll be some thug next to them with a gun to their head.
[02:47:17.542 --> 02:47:20.244]  If they're even suspected of doing that.
[02:47:22.515 --> 02:47:27.437]  Yeah, there's no doubt, though, that this isn't just going to be some old-fashioned tyranny or a soft tyranny.
[02:47:27.777 --> 02:47:34.199]  They're building the blackest, most wicked thing I've ever seen, and it's clearly for chewing up flesh, Aaron.
[02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:39.361]  Well, aside from that, I think this is also for total domination.
[02:47:40.722 --> 02:47:51.666]  I think they really do want a society full of robots, so to speak, who just do as they're told to do and take their pills and go to work and then come home and take another pill and
[02:47:52.512 --> 02:47:54.314]  Yeah, and just turn on the boob tube.
[02:47:55.134 --> 02:47:58.137]  So I think it's really even more than just what you're talking about.
[02:47:58.177 --> 02:48:06.343]  This is very far-reaching, where they want, in my opinion, and I think yours too, they want a society that is totally subservient.
[02:48:07.124 --> 02:48:14.830]  Well, that's what they've got with a certain segment, but people are rising up and waking up at record levels.
[02:48:16.491 --> 02:48:17.832]  Well, not enough.
[02:48:20.234 --> 02:48:22.036]  We've got 300 million people in this country.
[02:48:22.597 --> 02:48:23.077]  Think about it.
[02:48:23.097 --> 02:48:25.258]  How many are really rising up and waking up?
[02:48:25.398 --> 02:48:25.838]  A million?
[02:48:27.078 --> 02:48:27.638]  Two million?
[02:48:27.799 --> 02:48:31.220]  Yeah, two or three million, but that's more than the 500,000 a few years ago.
[02:48:31.780 --> 02:48:33.780]  Aaron Zellman, final segment with you straight ahead.
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:35.621]  I want to hear more about your ideas for solutions.
[02:48:36.321 --> 02:48:37.341]  Now, you've heard it from Larry Pratt.
[02:48:37.361 --> 02:48:37.941]  You've heard it from me.
[02:48:37.961 --> 02:48:39.042]  You've heard it from Aaron Zellman.
[02:48:39.542 --> 02:48:40.242]  This is it.
[02:48:40.342 --> 02:48:42.843]  The biggest attack we've ever seen.
[02:48:43.203 --> 02:48:44.763]  And they bought off the NRA.
[02:48:44.803 --> 02:48:45.504]  They always had them.
[02:48:46.624 --> 02:48:48.024]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:49.105 --> 02:48:50.105]  A new world order.
[02:48:50.848 --> 02:48:55.070]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:57.911]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:58.551 --> 02:49:00.812]  Could their objective be world domination?
[02:49:01.352 --> 02:49:03.793]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:04.533 --> 02:49:11.876]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:14.887 --> 02:49:19.871]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:20.371 --> 02:49:23.813]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:24.194 --> 02:49:26.715]  Bill of Rights makes great progress for the world government.
[02:49:26.755 --> 02:49:27.916]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:27.956 --> 02:49:28.697]  They're not after money.
[02:49:28.717 --> 02:49:29.777]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:29.998 --> 02:49:30.718]  They're after power.
[02:49:30.958 --> 02:49:32.099]  That's what they're after, you see.

[02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:47.181]  Federal agents!
[02:51:47.402 --> 02:51:49.244]  We are armed!
[02:51:49.284 --> 02:51:51.948]  Look, my police state films cover it.
[02:51:51.968 --> 02:51:53.170]  Now it's admitted.
[02:52:01.189 --> 02:52:07.691]  They have been training the military secretly for at least two and a half decades since 1988.
[02:52:08.691 --> 02:52:10.872]  That's the far back documents we've got in Eyewitnesses.
[02:52:11.492 --> 02:52:13.853]  To go door to door and take your guns in America.
[02:52:13.933 --> 02:52:17.474]  They've been aiding police in police uniforms.
[02:52:18.215 --> 02:52:20.455]  There's a huge shadow government operating.
[02:52:20.495 --> 02:52:22.236]  Now NORTHCOM is in full command.
[02:52:23.216 --> 02:52:25.417]  They work for big foreign corporate interest.
[02:52:27.398 --> 02:52:29.339]  The country is imploding financially.
[02:52:29.359 --> 02:52:31.480]  They're coming in with their gun control next year.
[02:52:31.500 --> 02:52:33.881]  Aaron Zellman is our guest.
[02:52:33.921 --> 02:52:35.901]  I hope you'll join JPFO.
[02:52:35.921 --> 02:52:40.103]  I hope you'll get involved with JPFO.
[02:52:40.163 --> 02:52:44.665]  Because being involved, you get the monthly letters and the emails, and now you're part of a group.
[02:52:44.705 --> 02:52:46.265]  That's the first step in taking action.
[02:52:46.545 --> 02:52:49.086]  But I go down and beat legislation to the Texas Legislature.
[02:52:49.486 --> 02:52:50.827]  You know, and they say nobody can beat it.
[02:52:51.357 --> 02:52:52.297]  With you, the listeners.
[02:52:52.797 --> 02:52:54.178]  We all have to do this.
[02:52:54.258 --> 02:52:55.258]  And Aaron, you're right.
[02:52:55.298 --> 02:52:57.139]  I mean, I guess that's the solution.
[02:52:57.199 --> 02:52:59.860]  People think they've got to fix everything with one fell swoop.
[02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:00.120]  No.
[02:53:00.540 --> 02:53:06.082]  It's just getting up off our hind ends and taking that first step towards trying to figure out what to do.
[02:53:06.902 --> 02:53:08.382]  And the answer is, what should we do?
[02:53:08.442 --> 02:53:10.623]  I guess just accelerate our education?
[02:53:10.643 --> 02:53:16.865]  I think the first step we've got to do, once people realize that they've got to do something,
[02:53:17.882 --> 02:53:21.905]  They better start talking to everyone in their family and everyone they work with and all of their neighbors.
[02:53:23.507 --> 02:53:28.831]  They've got to reach out to those people they can reach out to quickly and efficiently.
[02:53:29.812 --> 02:53:32.594]  And convince them to come on board.
[02:53:33.215 --> 02:53:36.718]  Get them to stop feeling and believing and start thinking.
[02:53:38.099 --> 02:53:40.961]  And start thinking about a harsh reality.
[02:53:41.662 --> 02:53:45.565]  That a great evil is certainly coming our way.
[02:53:46.792 --> 02:53:53.117]  You know, people are very concerned about putting out little brush fires, but they're not paying attention to the armored column that's coming our way.
[02:53:53.157 --> 02:53:57.641]  And this is something that, you know, our enemies have been very clever at.
[02:53:57.681 --> 02:54:03.466]  They've got us worried about this effect or that effect or this event, but we're not paying attention to the armored column.
[02:54:05.367 --> 02:54:05.868]  I see it.
[02:54:06.168 --> 02:54:08.610]  I mean, that's been my take the last four months.
[02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:11.873]  I've said, I see them like powering up a huge gun.
[02:54:13.253 --> 02:54:27.239]  And, you know, like a Death Star, they're powering it up, aiming it, they're saying what they're going to do, and the average Joe's running around going, I'm the NRA, everything's good, and they just can't believe the NRA is a vicious anti-gun organization.
[02:54:28.359 --> 02:54:39.584]  Well, I think they've proven that, and I think that once they went on record as saying they were opposed to abolishing the ATF, and also acknowledging that when they had the opportunity to do so, they didn't want to,
[02:54:41.111 --> 02:54:47.375]  That's all I needed to hear from the NRA, that they have become the enemy of the Second Amendment.
[02:54:48.415 --> 02:54:51.777]  And I think anybody that supports that organization, shame on them.
[02:54:52.678 --> 02:54:53.398]  Shame on them.
[02:54:55.719 --> 02:54:57.620]  Well, I knew they were anti-gun ten years ago.
[02:54:57.640 --> 02:54:59.982]  People get mad at me, but now folks aren't getting mad.
[02:55:00.042 --> 02:55:00.922]  Now they know the truth.
[02:55:01.682 --> 02:55:05.625]  Aaron, how do folks get involved with Gun Owners of America?
[02:55:05.645 --> 02:55:07.946]  Obviously, you're involved with them, but also with JPFO.
[02:55:09.045 --> 02:55:12.387]  Well, Gunners of America is an excellent organization for lobbying.
[02:55:12.407 --> 02:55:16.048]  A no-compromise lobby group, and I encourage people to support them.
[02:55:17.189 --> 02:55:27.133]  JPFO, JPFO.org, is a group that's focused on giving people what we call intellectual ammunition, so that you can educate people and wake them up.
[02:55:27.793 --> 02:55:32.275]  So, in fact, they can better appreciate the efforts of Gunners of America when they're lobbying.
[02:55:32.876 --> 02:55:34.677]  So people understand the issue.
[02:55:35.197 --> 02:55:35.877]  Absolutely.
[02:55:35.997 --> 02:55:37.678]  Fire out the website and the number.
[02:55:39.471 --> 02:55:40.311]  Uh, 800-869-1884.
[02:55:40.331 --> 02:55:40.611]  800-869-1884.
[02:55:40.671 --> 02:55:47.976]  And the website again is JPFO.org.
[02:55:48.316 --> 02:55:56.962]  Aaron Zellman, as this develops in the new year, we want to have you on several times as we watch the Supreme Court in March prepare to fire on us.
[02:55:57.602 --> 02:55:58.183]  God bless you.
[02:55:58.223 --> 02:55:58.943]  Have a great holiday.
[02:55:59.303 --> 02:55:59.584]  Thank you.
[02:55:59.604 --> 02:56:00.284]  You too, Alex.
[02:56:01.325 --> 02:56:02.926]  Alright, we're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:02.986 --> 02:56:04.407]  I want to apologize to all the stations.
[02:56:04.447 --> 02:56:05.988]  I sound like a toad.
[02:56:06.906 --> 02:56:08.647]  I've been sick, but at least I'm here.
[02:56:09.087 --> 02:56:11.888]  And I'll be back tomorrow, unless I'm really sick.
[02:56:12.028 --> 02:56:17.130]  I almost didn't come today, but wild horses can't drag me away, so God, please heal me.
[02:56:18.451 --> 02:56:22.352]  And the retransmission starts now if you missed the first hour at Infowars.com.
