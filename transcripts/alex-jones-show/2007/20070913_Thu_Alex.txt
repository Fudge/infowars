[00:00:05.817 --> 00:00:10.000]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-ups.
[00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:11.461]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.222 --> 00:00:13.143]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:17.466]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:22.109]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:26.893]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.972]  It is already the 13th day of September 2007.
[00:00:30.512 --> 00:00:32.875]  We'll be live here for the next 2 hours and 59 minutes 24 seconds.
[00:00:40.883 --> 00:00:43.785]  A lot of very big breaking news today.
[00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:48.009]  Headline up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:52.652]  9-11 first responders are WTC demolition countdown.
[00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:56.075]  We have this in triplicate from a whole slew of sources.
[00:00:56.495 --> 00:00:59.397]  That is coming up later in this hour.
[00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:10.166]  I'm also going to try to calmly run down chronological events of what developed while I was in New York Friday through Wednesday morning for the sixth anniversary.
[00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:14.314]  We're going to have open phones today for two different groups of people.
[00:01:14.334 --> 00:01:21.588]  9-11 Truth demonstrators, or 9-11 Truth so-called wannabe debunkers.
[00:01:21.628 --> 00:01:23.071]  You can always call in and disagree with us.
[00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:31.900]  I also want to hear from folks with their take, their angle on what's happening with the escalating Edna Lane Brown situation in New Hampshire.
[00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:37.341]  Headline, Associated Press, four associates of Ed Brown were arrested yesterday.
[00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:40.782]  We now have more details than what you'll see in the news.
[00:01:41.162 --> 00:01:42.182]  We'll be going over that.
[00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:48.143]  Marshals, again, four associates of Tex, evading couple in their words, arrested.
[00:01:50.444 --> 00:01:51.364]  Also, we will
[00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:59.601]  Get into General Petraeus and his propaganda on the war front and where that situation is going.
[00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:07.167]  And the dollar hits all-time lows yet again, each week hitting all-time lows as the downward plunge accelerates.
[00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.974]  The toll-free number to join us on air if you're involved with the Browns or the Browns would like to call in.
[00:02:14.994 --> 00:02:16.255]  Their numbers are constantly changing.
[00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:16.956]  We tried their numbers.
[00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:17.576]  They don't work.
[00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:20.519]  They're also welcome to call in.
[00:02:22.006 --> 00:02:23.146]  The toll-free number is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:23.246]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:23.286 --> 00:02:36.429]  I have to tell you that this whole Ed and Elaine Brown situation from the very start, as myself and Jack McClam have discussed, is a situation where you're stuck between a rock and a hard place and
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.223]  There's so many thoughts that have gone through my mind yesterday since I got off the airplane in Austin, Texas at 5 o'clock, right as the arrest news were breaking.
[00:02:57.903 --> 00:03:13.969]  And what I learned last night and several hours of phone calls this morning, so when we get back from break, I'm going to walk through all of that by first reading through some of the news stories and then breaking down where I think all of this is going, where I would like it to go, but unfortunately where I see it going.
[00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.331]  And just to see if the listeners have any ideas of how to avert this or
[00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:29.602]  Or how to try to stop this situation that again is spiraling ever downward, just like the Iraq War, just like our economy.
[00:03:30.942 --> 00:03:32.663]  But there is, of course, the silver lining.
[00:03:32.723 --> 00:03:34.564]  People are waking up to government-sponsored terror.
[00:03:34.584 --> 00:03:37.345]  They're waking up to corruption of the New World Order.
[00:03:37.626 --> 00:03:42.008]  We're seeing distrust of the corrupt government intensifying by the minute.
[00:03:42.728 --> 00:03:44.449]  And it's all coming to a head.
[00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:45.950]  Everything is accelerating.
[00:03:47.702 --> 00:03:48.643]  This is intensifying.
[00:03:49.123 --> 00:03:51.545]  Again, later I'll get into my rest Friday night.
[00:03:52.806 --> 00:04:01.012]  Hard to believe that was, what, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 full days ago, but I can now for the first time calmly go over it on the air.
[00:04:01.893 --> 00:04:08.918]  Other days I'd be calling in while walking with a protest of a thousand people all over New York where we strode.
[00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.601]  And then of course trying to call in from the airport yesterday with Bob.
[00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:17.044]  I can now calmly go through everything that happened and talk about the great successes we had.
[00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:25.288]  In getting the truth out of the fact of 9-11, also new breaking developments there on the 9-11 front.
[00:04:25.688 --> 00:04:33.135]  The story up on PrisonPlanet.com is so huge, but I'll get into that after we cover the tragic Ed and Elaine Brown story.
[00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:38.500]  9-11 first responders heard WTC demolition countdown.
[00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:40.807]  All this and a lot more.
[00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:43.648]  If you're looking for the info war, you found it.
[00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.710]  You're now on the very front lines.
[00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.611]  You're now at the tip of the spear.
[00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:51.913]  And I'm your wartime broadcaster in the battle for the Republic.
[00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:06.622]  Black Berkey purification elements are more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:05:06.682 --> 00:05:14.006]  These awesome elements are used in Berkey purification systems and they can also be used to upgrade most other gravity filtration systems.
[00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:24.811]  They can purify raw, untreated water by removing pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, trihalomethanes, and chemicals such as chlorine, atrazine, styrene, and MTBE.
[00:05:24.972 --> 00:05:29.514]  These elements also reduce unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:05:29.794 --> 00:05:34.801]  Unbelievably, they even remove small micro-particulate from water like food coloring particles.
[00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:37.945]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:47.978]  Moreover, because they are recleanable, black Berkey elements are more economical than the standard disposable elements, providing fresh, pure water for less than two cents per gallon.
[00:05:48.038 --> 00:05:52.907]  Get a 2-pack for only $99 or a 4-pack for only $188 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:52.947 --> 00:05:54.910]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:06:04.492 --> 00:06:10.002]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.362 --> 00:06:17.975]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.692 --> 00:06:25.735]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:37.560]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.382]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.822 --> 00:06:43.803]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:44.103 --> 00:06:47.945]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:02.018 --> 00:07:06.382]  The Digestive Tract, a natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[00:07:06.782 --> 00:07:11.767]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[00:07:12.187 --> 00:07:14.069]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[00:07:14.773 --> 00:07:21.797]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[00:07:22.257 --> 00:07:27.200]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[00:07:27.521 --> 00:07:32.904]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[00:07:33.064 --> 00:07:35.425]  You'll feel lighter and you'll feel clean inside.
[00:07:35.525 --> 00:07:39.388]  And when you remove the waste buildup with AlloCleanse, you'll have more energy.
[00:07:39.648 --> 00:07:43.250]  Energy to use on other things besides worrying about constipation.
[00:07:43.749 --> 00:07:48.592]  For a risk-free trial of Allocleanse, call 1-800-890-3525.
[00:07:48.812 --> 00:07:52.214]  Call in now to find out how you can get two free gifts with your order.
[00:07:52.374 --> 00:07:54.675]  Try Allocleanse risk-free by calling 1-800-890-3525.
[00:07:54.695 --> 00:07:54.915]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[00:08:01.132 --> 00:08:06.175]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.555 --> 00:08:08.856]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:18.921 --> 00:08:21.543]  Alright, we're live back from the Big Apple.
[00:08:23.582 --> 00:08:31.286]  Back from New York City, 6th anniversary of the tragic 9-11 terror attacks, the black-off attacks.
[00:08:33.107 --> 00:08:36.769]  I am back in Austin, Texas here.
[00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.610]  We'll be live for the next 2 hours 55 minutes.
[00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:47.294]  We're going to have open phones throughout the broadcast later, specifically on 9-11, 6th anniversary and the Edna Lane Brown escalations.
[00:08:48.586 --> 00:08:49.587]  It cannot be ignored.
[00:08:49.607 --> 00:08:54.609]  It must be covered here, though the whole thing is spiraling continually out of control.
[00:08:54.629 --> 00:08:56.069]  I want to pray for everybody involved.
[00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:00.771]  Coming up, 9-11 First Responder, her WTC7 demolition countdown.
[00:09:01.251 --> 00:09:02.112]  We'll be going over that.
[00:09:02.132 --> 00:09:03.352]  That is huge news.
[00:09:03.432 --> 00:09:12.836]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com and needs to be gotten out to everybody because we've compiled all the different rescue workers and emergency workers and police and firemen on tape.
[00:09:14.236 --> 00:09:17.358]  We were told to get back that the government was going to blow up Building 7.
[00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:28.918]  So the cover up there and the weakest link in the official conspiracy theory is now unraveling rapidly as everything else seems to be.
[00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:37.543]  Before I get into the Edna Lane Brown situation and the four arrests that have been made, let me just get into the general discussion of everything that's transpired.
[00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:48.230]  In the last year, we learned of Edna Lane Brown, who I'd interviewed long before the latest convictions came down.
[00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:56.620]  And we all know that the IRS is a private collection agency for the private Federal Reserve.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.681]  We know it is a fraud of unconstitutional tax.
[00:09:59.001 --> 00:09:59.662]  That's been proven.
[00:09:59.702 --> 00:10:00.382]  It's not debatable.
[00:10:01.843 --> 00:10:16.552]  But I get criticized because I have made the decision to have former Treasury agents like Joe Bancheron, who after he went public for several years and exposed it, they came at gunpoint and arrested him and took him to jail, and the jury found him not guilty.
[00:10:17.052 --> 00:10:18.233]  I mean, they tried to put him in prison.
[00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:23.139]  They have arrested Sherry Jackson, IRS agent, who's been exposing them.
[00:10:23.219 --> 00:10:24.359]  I mean, they arrest you!
[00:10:26.439 --> 00:10:37.101]  And so while I have these great heroes on the air, I've made the public declarative statement, just as Aaron Russo has done, that I pay the unconstitutional tax.
[00:10:37.962 --> 00:10:39.962]  And that's because I have to choose my battles.
[00:10:41.162 --> 00:10:44.523]  Napoleon made the mistake of fighting on three fronts.
[00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:53.014]  Hitler made the mistake, I'm not comparing myself to them, it's just a military analogy, made the mistake of fighting on several fronts.
[00:10:54.254 --> 00:10:58.516]  And I choose where I'm going to fight and how and where I'm going to fight.
[00:10:58.596 --> 00:10:59.797]  I like to choose the place.
[00:10:59.857 --> 00:11:01.597]  I like to choose the issue.
[00:11:03.938 --> 00:11:09.781]  Those that want to fight the income tax, I think it's a laudable goal, but you should know that you're dealing with a mafia.
[00:11:10.421 --> 00:11:12.682]  You should know you're dealing with hardcore criminals.
[00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:28.566]  You should know you're dealing with an elite that bombed Serbia from one end to the other with depleted uranium, that purposefully have been bombing Iraq for 16 plus years, and have blown out all of its infrastructure and over 3 million people, that's an official number, have died.
[00:11:28.927 --> 00:11:31.287]  Their number's gone from 25 million to 22 million.
[00:11:31.827 --> 00:11:34.028]  That's the census.
[00:11:34.268 --> 00:11:37.269]  700 plus thousand in the last four years just from combat-related deaths.
[00:11:40.191 --> 00:11:40.992]  Collateral damage.
[00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:44.054]  They don't care about you, and they don't care about your life.
[00:11:44.434 --> 00:11:49.437]  They don't care about these cops who take their kids in to get the shots full of mercury and cancer viruses.
[00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:52.119]  They don't care about any of us.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:02.966]  And so, people say, oh, we're in tyranny, and then they get so shocked when they put themselves wide open in the crosshairs of the enemy, and they get crushed.
[00:12:03.046 --> 00:12:06.469]  They are always amazed when it happens.
[00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:12.400]  All I've ever said is, know what you're getting into.
[00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:15.861]  Know what you're facing.
[00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:22.723]  And there's a few areas where they're guaranteed to come after you.
[00:12:25.684 --> 00:12:33.066]  And if you don't pay the income tax and shoot your mouth off and talk about it, they are going to come after you.
[00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:35.867]  Maybe in one year, it may be in five years, it may be in ten years.
[00:12:36.627 --> 00:12:39.849]  And you'll end up like poor Sim Cannon of Arrow Custom Plastics.
[00:12:39.869 --> 00:12:40.910]  She really did nothing wrong.
[00:12:41.431 --> 00:12:44.453]  He just said, I'm not making my employees pay taxes.
[00:12:44.473 --> 00:12:45.474]  They can pay what they want.
[00:12:45.954 --> 00:12:47.735]  It's not my job to be an indentured servant.
[00:12:49.096 --> 00:12:52.479]  And sure, you violate your Fifth Amendment when you sign a 10-W form.
[00:12:55.601 --> 00:12:56.742]  When you sign those tax forms.
[00:12:57.062 --> 00:12:57.663]  It's all true.
[00:12:57.723 --> 00:12:58.383]  It's all a fraud.
[00:12:58.403 --> 00:12:59.064]  It's all criminal.
[00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:04.928]  But I, as a leader,
[00:13:06.124 --> 00:13:14.149]  In news and information, try to always at least be honest with my audience about where certain decisions will lead.
[00:13:18.092 --> 00:13:23.195]  And some of you want to have a violent, fiery confrontation with the minions of the New World Order.
[00:13:25.176 --> 00:13:32.401]  Some of you want to get into a conflict, or at least you think you want to get into a conflict, until it actually starts happening.
[00:13:33.461 --> 00:13:33.922]  And then you
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:38.721]  Scream bloody murder and I don't blame you.
[00:13:40.861 --> 00:13:43.982]  Tyranny and enslavement and bondage and oppressment.
[00:13:46.643 --> 00:13:48.103]  Oppression is a terrible thing.
[00:13:52.404 --> 00:13:54.145]  So many years ago I studied the law.
[00:13:54.185 --> 00:13:55.065]  I looked at what was happening.
[00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:58.566]  I made the decision to be a radio broadcaster, documentary filmmaker.
[00:14:00.319 --> 00:14:13.965]  And to do everything I can in the information war to peacefully try to point out the crimes of the New World Order and then destroy their support with the population to discredit them with the truth.
[00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:22.448]  And that has been the most effective thing in my own 12 plus years of experience and the most effective thing I've seen in history.
[00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:39.570]  When you're able to get the word out, when you're able to have committees of correspondence and chronicle the crimes of the New World Order, and when you're able to reach millions of people on the internet every week, that is extremely effective.
[00:14:40.894 --> 00:14:42.595]  That's why they're racing to shut down the web.
[00:14:42.615 --> 00:14:44.397]  That's why they're racing to stop free speech.
[00:14:44.637 --> 00:14:46.859]  That's why they're trying to stop demonstrations all over the country.
[00:14:47.259 --> 00:14:52.563]  And every time they do it, it blows up in their face because everyone can look at it and know that that's tyranny.
[00:14:52.944 --> 00:14:54.905]  And that proves our very point.
[00:14:56.527 --> 00:15:01.170]  When I got arrested for something that's a non-arrestable offense, the police had to admit it and apologized.
[00:15:02.552 --> 00:15:05.394]  That made the system and the establishment look bad.
[00:15:06.094 --> 00:15:07.556]  And that made our numbers grow.
[00:15:08.096 --> 00:15:10.298]  And dozens of TV stations and networks
[00:15:11.295 --> 00:15:25.342]  And newspapers, from the New York Post, the New York Daily News, the Fox News, to every local Austin TV station, it's hundreds, it's all over the country, saw that and mainstream news said I was arrested for spreading 9-11 truth.
[00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:27.623]  And they were pretty much positive articles, many of them.
[00:15:29.244 --> 00:15:33.566]  We are converting people to be patriots and to be constitutionalists right now.
[00:15:35.214 --> 00:15:46.900]  Now, when Ed and Elaine Brown were wrongfully convicted, I supported them and said that I didn't want them to be arrested, didn't want them to go to prison, didn't want them to be killed, didn't want them to end their lives, or to have their lives ended.
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:58.586]  I didn't want their lives to end at the hands of the hired federal constabulary that works for the New World Order, literal mercenaries, whether they know it or not.
[00:16:00.507 --> 00:16:03.649]  And as things deteriorated, I heard lots of fiery rhetoric about
[00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:33.653]  armed conflict uh... discussions about how the authorities uh... would be attacked if the browns were attacked and i cautioned everyone that that's what the new world order wants let me just be clear about this it's a simple tactics do you think david rockefeller and zbigniew brzezinski and ward rothschild and george bush hillary clinton
[00:16:34.941 --> 00:16:44.383]  Do you think they care if five or six FBI agents and a hostage rescue team or an assault team die going into the Browns' house?
[00:16:46.123 --> 00:16:46.804]  No, they love it.
[00:16:48.344 --> 00:16:51.284]  Do you think they care that 15,000 U.S.
[00:16:51.304 --> 00:16:51.985]  troops are dead?
[00:16:52.005 --> 00:16:56.686]  You know, they now say it's up to 4,000 official numbers, but that means you died in country.
[00:16:57.446 --> 00:17:01.907]  If you die after you've been taken out to Rammstein or to another base, it doesn't count.
[00:17:01.947 --> 00:17:02.547]  It's well over 15,000.
[00:17:05.305 --> 00:17:06.005]  You think they care?
[00:17:06.045 --> 00:17:06.685]  No, they don't care.
[00:17:10.086 --> 00:17:30.191]  And so, it will not hurt the New World Order if the feds, the federal marshals with a gaggle of FBI locals, go into Edwin Brown's house and shoot the place up, and we have some new wounded knee, like they had last century.
[00:17:30.551 --> 00:17:32.732]  They had a wounded knee before that, the century before last.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.343]  Do you think that's going to hurt the New World Order?
[00:17:38.363 --> 00:17:39.724]  No, as Jack McClam said here.
[00:17:39.744 --> 00:17:40.765]  In fact, you know what?
[00:17:40.805 --> 00:17:41.246]  Call Jack.
[00:17:41.286 --> 00:17:42.346]  Let's get him on in the second hour.
[00:17:43.147 --> 00:17:46.110]  If we can, I'm going to get like a 20-minute take on all this from him.
[00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.591]  I'm sure it'll be the same as mine.
[00:17:47.651 --> 00:17:53.576]  It's common sense and comes from research understanding, Officer Jack McClam, that that will help the New World Order.
[00:17:53.616 --> 00:18:01.063]  It won't help those Federal Marshals' wives when they don't come home or when they get paralyzed from a .50 caliber bullet going through them.
[00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:05.912]  It won't help Ed and Elaine Brown if they lie dead in a pool of blood.
[00:18:06.233 --> 00:18:11.216]  Every time I talk about Ed and Elaine Brown being dead, people get mad in the patient room and go, don't talk about that!
[00:18:11.436 --> 00:18:13.258]  What do you mean, don't talk about the reality?
[00:18:13.778 --> 00:18:15.299]  Don't talk about what the stakes are here?
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:17.241]  I'll talk about whatever I want to talk about!
[00:18:20.299 --> 00:18:25.141]  Quite frankly, I think having parties up there downplays the seriousness of all of this.
[00:18:25.381 --> 00:18:33.744]  And I know people want to put a good face on it and say, oh, it's all happy and everything's great up there while a Homeland Security helicopter flies around at 40 feet above the ground, but it's not!
[00:18:35.625 --> 00:18:40.767]  And frankly, if I'm going to talk about something like that, I've got to tell my listeners, when you do go up there, it's very serious!
[00:18:41.987 --> 00:18:45.528]  And you could end up getting an aiding and abetting charge put on you!
[00:18:45.788 --> 00:18:47.069]  You could end up going to prison!
[00:18:49.947 --> 00:18:52.188]  I'm not here to send my listeners to prison.
[00:18:52.828 --> 00:18:54.569]  I don't want that on my soul.
[00:18:54.809 --> 00:18:59.190]  I don't want that on my reap what you sow, karma, whatever you want to call it.
[00:18:59.371 --> 00:19:00.951]  I don't need that type of stuff in my life.
[00:19:03.692 --> 00:19:07.153]  Every piece of advice I give you is because it comes right out of my heart and soul.
[00:19:08.614 --> 00:19:11.675]  I literally get tears in my eyes every day when desperate phone calls come in.
[00:19:11.695 --> 00:19:12.455]  There's hundreds of them.
[00:19:12.495 --> 00:19:13.496]  I can't even keep track of it.
[00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:16.577]  With women crying as their children are being taken by these monsters.
[00:19:17.566 --> 00:19:20.507]  Old people being euthanized, and people having their land taken.
[00:19:20.547 --> 00:19:25.029]  I can't even hardly listen to all the messages in the time I've got, much less call them back, much less help them!
[00:19:25.489 --> 00:19:27.290]  Believe me, I hate this criminal government!
[00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:28.730]  And I hate what it's doing!
[00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:30.031]  And I know it's wicked!
[00:19:33.352 --> 00:19:37.053]  But many of the people serving it are literally brainwashed, like the general public.
[00:19:37.474 --> 00:19:40.815]  And they can't see the forest or the trees, but we're starting to wake them up as well.
[00:19:43.015 --> 00:19:53.385]  And the last thing we need is some big violent confrontation to kick off a new string of domestic terrorism operations, which they're then going to point at the American people.
[00:19:54.666 --> 00:19:58.190]  I'm going to break this down, give you the latest developments, and a lot more.
[00:19:58.750 --> 00:19:59.231]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.565 --> 00:20:04.567]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:09.810]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:20:10.071 --> 00:20:14.413]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:23.639]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.462]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:20:27.742 --> 00:20:32.785]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:20:33.066 --> 00:20:39.810]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:40.671]  What about you?
[00:20:41.588 --> 00:20:47.290]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:21:02.222 --> 00:21:05.124]  Ted Anderson from MIDAS, September 13, 2007.
[00:21:05.185 --> 00:21:12.531]  Gold 70740, owns gold coins can be purchased for $729.71, $379.90 for half, $179.95 per quarter.
[00:21:12.551 --> 00:21:16.154]  That's $729.71, $359.90, and $179.95.
[00:21:17.014 --> 00:21:22.999]  The Chinese government has begun a campaign of economic threats against the U.S., hinting liquidation of its vast holdings of U.S.
[00:21:23.059 --> 00:21:27.343]  Treasuries, responding to Washington's trade sanctions, forcing Yan revolution.
[00:21:27.683 --> 00:21:36.131]  Communist Party bodies are warning that Beijing may use its 1.33 trillion reserves as a political weapon causing bond yields to spike, hammering the U.S.
[00:21:36.171 --> 00:21:38.774]  housing market and throwing the economy into a recession.
[00:21:39.054 --> 00:21:42.918]  Russia, Switzerland and several other countries have reduced their holdings due to this threat.
[00:21:43.098 --> 00:21:49.504]  Economist Ambrose Evans Pritchard published the report, China Threatens Nuclear Option of Dollar Sales.
[00:21:49.844 --> 00:21:53.371]  Call for the report today, 800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.391 --> 00:21:56.577]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[00:21:56.677 --> 00:21:56.918]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.958 --> 00:21:57.138]  That's 800-686-22...
[00:22:02.512 --> 00:22:04.573]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:05.213 --> 00:22:14.115]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:14.555 --> 00:22:21.757]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:22.486 --> 00:22:27.991]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:22:28.471 --> 00:22:39.300]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:22:40.061 --> 00:22:42.063]  Laser technology at its best.
[00:22:42.623 --> 00:22:45.405]  For more information call 702-953-0267 or visit www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:22:45.445 --> 00:22:45.786]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:23:01.224 --> 00:23:03.185]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:23:03.445 --> 00:23:06.505]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:23:06.765 --> 00:23:11.547]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:23:11.867 --> 00:23:14.587]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:23:14.847 --> 00:23:19.508]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[00:23:19.788 --> 00:23:21.709]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:32.132]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[00:23:32.492 --> 00:23:37.193]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:23:37.553 --> 00:23:41.094]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars!
[00:23:41.314 --> 00:23:43.454]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[00:23:43.774 --> 00:23:45.935]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[00:23:46.115 --> 00:23:47.897]  We'll even refund the shipping charge!
[00:23:48.218 --> 00:23:51.322]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[00:23:51.542 --> 00:23:52.443]  What are you waiting for?
[00:23:52.624 --> 00:23:53.304]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[00:23:53.405 --> 00:23:53.725]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[00:23:53.765 --> 00:23:53.925]  Today!
[00:24:18.785 --> 00:24:19.686]  I've studied history.
[00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:25.954]  We're winning the info war for the hearts and minds of the people.
[00:24:27.115 --> 00:24:37.027]  The globalists will probably stage more events to try to push their whole agenda of an unfolding police state, but then we've already blocked them and put them into check.
[00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:40.791]  Not in checkmate yet, but in check.
[00:24:40.851 --> 00:25:05.969]  We're right on their tail in this fight, because now, in major polls, for Feds listening, you can Google it right now, Scripps Howard News Service polls, Gallup polls, Angus and Reed polls, Mason-Dixon polls, Zogby polls, the lowest polls now have 65% believing the government could have been involved and that they know there's a cover-up.
[00:25:06.502 --> 00:25:09.444]  That's paraphrasing almost the exact poll from last week.
[00:25:12.045 --> 00:25:17.948]  As high as 84% in the Angus & Reed last year believe there's a cover-up.
[00:25:18.268 --> 00:25:19.449]  There should be a new investigation.
[00:25:19.949 --> 00:25:22.450]  Now, boys, that's who you're working for.
[00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.811]  You have not won the info war.
[00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:25.672]  You have lost.
[00:25:26.872 --> 00:25:29.394]  And I know most of you weren't involved in blowing up those buildings.
[00:25:30.234 --> 00:25:35.377]  But when I was at Ground Zero, Bullhorning, two days ago, there were hundreds of police
[00:25:36.497 --> 00:25:44.641]  And they would look at me and I'd say you know it's an inside job and over half of them would nod at me and would wink and some of them had tears in their eyes.
[00:25:45.221 --> 00:25:51.824]  Other higher-ups though were angry because they've made the compromises to move up the chain.
[00:25:53.005 --> 00:26:03.870]  Firemen were saluting us and I was saying you know about the countdown for seven because many of the same police and firemen are still
[00:26:04.841 --> 00:26:10.589]  In the same precinct, right there near Ground Zero, and they were nodding their heads, and I started seeing tears come out of some of their eyes.
[00:26:12.392 --> 00:26:14.514]  Because they were thinking, oh my God.
[00:26:15.556 --> 00:26:19.762]  You see, because even though they were there and heard the countdown to blow up Building 7, it was bringing it back.
[00:26:20.483 --> 00:26:21.424]  Making it real.
[00:26:22.136 --> 00:26:24.196]  And then I brought up what's been all over New York papers.
[00:26:24.957 --> 00:26:28.837]  We told you that it was deadly poison and now thousands have died, tens of thousands are sick.
[00:26:29.358 --> 00:26:31.678]  And the federal government lied about it and that's now come out.
[00:26:31.998 --> 00:26:38.940]  And then even AP reported that 45% of the victims' remains were dug out, bone fragments, you name it.
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:45.581]  And then the city didn't even dump them in a hole and put a plaque on it at some Arlington Cemetery or something.
[00:26:45.901 --> 00:26:46.141]  No.
[00:26:47.841 --> 00:26:49.942]  No, they took them and they put them in potholes.
[00:26:51.405 --> 00:26:53.926]  And the cops knew about that and they started getting really freaked out.
[00:26:54.506 --> 00:27:02.870]  And I even saw some of the ones that were laughing started getting really upset and then looking at me like the wind was taking out of their sails because I was talking right to them as a man.
[00:27:03.531 --> 00:27:05.151]  I wasn't talking to them like I hated them.
[00:27:05.512 --> 00:27:07.773]  I wasn't talking to them like I wanted to have a fight with them.
[00:27:08.093 --> 00:27:10.294]  I wasn't talking to them like they weren't human beings.
[00:27:10.814 --> 00:27:15.236]  I was coming across that thin blue line and telling them, you know you work for crooks.
[00:27:16.037 --> 00:27:18.998]  And they were literally near ground zero putting new asphalt in
[00:27:19.841 --> 00:27:23.044]  And the news has reported that that's where they're literally getting the mix.
[00:27:23.645 --> 00:27:31.132]  The aggregate mix for the asphalt is literally dead firemen, EMTs, victims in the towers, and cops.
[00:27:33.474 --> 00:27:35.355]  That's how cold-blooded these people are.
[00:27:35.375 --> 00:27:37.137]  It's some kind of sick joke.
[00:27:37.958 --> 00:27:39.940]  To literally take their bones.
[00:27:42.282 --> 00:27:45.385]  To literally take their bones.
[00:27:47.904 --> 00:27:48.705]  And put them in there.
[00:27:49.285 --> 00:28:15.605]  We were in a cab, driving, for the last event I did Tuesday night at a church, in a really nice area in New York, in an uptown area, and there were big piles of asphalt, they were putting out asphalt on the road at night, and the car stopped, and we had our cameras put up, but I leaned out and I looked, and again, it's admitted, AP, that most of the aggregate material is from the towers.
[00:28:16.946 --> 00:28:19.187]  And folks, I know what bone fragments look like.
[00:28:19.247 --> 00:28:20.667]  And I said, oh, we're going to come back there in a minute.
[00:28:20.687 --> 00:28:21.607]  We were late getting to the church.
[00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:22.607]  I was with William Rodriguez.
[00:28:23.148 --> 00:28:23.988]  And we didn't come back.
[00:28:24.168 --> 00:28:25.568]  Somebody's got to go over there and look at this.
[00:28:26.308 --> 00:28:28.269]  And folks, I know what bone looks like.
[00:28:28.329 --> 00:28:29.249]  Burned, charred bone.
[00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:30.189]  There was bone.
[00:28:30.949 --> 00:28:35.510]  Or there was white stone that was carved like bone fragments in there.
[00:28:38.111 --> 00:28:39.812]  I mean, you talk about a spiritual experience.
[00:28:39.992 --> 00:28:41.552]  I was looking at the bones.
[00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:43.378]  The bones.
[00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:44.678]  And that's what AP reported.
[00:28:44.698 --> 00:28:46.339]  They went out and it was bones being dumped.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:47.780]  Bones are in it.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:51.523]  There's been video and photos out of the landfill where they dumped it all and there's just bones.
[00:28:51.563 --> 00:28:53.884]  I mean, some of them are whole parts of femurs.
[00:28:55.565 --> 00:28:56.566]  Pieces of skulls.
[00:28:58.887 --> 00:29:05.331]  Some of the people weren't completely burned up that fell and had things crush them and their shirts and teeth and gold fillings.
[00:29:05.411 --> 00:29:10.635]  And they didn't even take it out to some park and dig a hole and dump it.
[00:29:11.644 --> 00:29:13.966]  Put a fence around it and a plaque or a memorial.
[00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:18.051]  I mean, that's what they think about you.
[00:29:19.452 --> 00:29:20.894]  That's what they think about you.
[00:29:20.914 --> 00:29:24.557]  When we get back, I'll get into the Ed and Elaine Brown situation.
[00:29:24.617 --> 00:29:25.358]  I'm already getting off into 9-11.
[00:29:25.518 --> 00:29:27.861]  There's so much I want to talk about, what we experienced there.
[00:29:27.881 --> 00:29:30.363]  And I know your calls are there as well.
[00:29:30.383 --> 00:29:34.868]  A lot of audio clips coming up today as well from some of the things that happened there in New York.
[00:29:38.809 --> 00:29:45.897]  We'll be right back after this break and get into the really big news of 9-11 first responders, our WTC7 demolition countdown.
[00:29:46.338 --> 00:29:47.058]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.144 --> 00:29:55.147]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.048 --> 00:29:58.732]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.043 --> 00:30:03.884]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:09.205]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:30:09.365 --> 00:30:10.706]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:30:10.986 --> 00:30:19.148]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:30:19.368 --> 00:30:25.090]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:27.052]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:30:27.112 --> 00:30:29.274]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:30:29.314 --> 00:30:33.659]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:36.021]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:30:36.081 --> 00:30:42.688]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio burning.
[00:30:45.191 --> 00:30:45.691]  I feel great!
[00:31:04.599 --> 00:31:06.180]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:06.761]  Really?
[00:31:06.981 --> 00:31:07.401]  What is it?
[00:31:07.621 --> 00:31:08.081]  How does it work?
[00:31:08.282 --> 00:31:14.866]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[00:31:15.026 --> 00:31:17.308]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[00:31:17.508 --> 00:31:22.832]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[00:31:23.152 --> 00:31:23.633]  That's it?
[00:31:23.933 --> 00:31:25.455]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[00:31:25.715 --> 00:31:26.416]  It is easy.
[00:31:26.616 --> 00:31:33.343]  Plus, the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[00:31:33.624 --> 00:31:35.125]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[00:31:35.446 --> 00:31:36.146]  That's amazing!
[00:31:36.567 --> 00:31:41.933]  And, the bentonite clay and mediclines eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[00:31:42.213 --> 00:31:42.554]  Well, how?
[00:31:42.774 --> 00:31:43.875]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[00:31:44.155 --> 00:31:46.999]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[00:31:47.079 --> 00:31:50.283]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[00:31:50.423 --> 00:31:53.847]  For only $22.95 plus shipping, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.
[00:31:54.027 --> 00:31:54.628]  Or call them at 1-800-317-9547.
[00:31:54.648 --> 00:31:54.848]  That's 1-800-317-9547.
[00:31:54.868 --> 00:31:55.168]  Call today.
[00:32:02.797 --> 00:32:04.498]  Are you tired of frequent urination?
[00:32:04.918 --> 00:32:07.139]  Do you drink a ton of water and still feel thirsty?
[00:32:07.479 --> 00:32:10.541]  The quantity of water you drink is not the key to hydration.
[00:32:10.701 --> 00:32:13.663]  The key to hydration is the correct clustering of water.
[00:32:13.843 --> 00:32:17.344]  When water has the ideal cluster, your cells will readily absorb it.
[00:32:17.485 --> 00:32:23.868]  Some companies sell concentrated versions of this kind of water, making you spend up to $70 per month to treat your water.
[00:32:24.288 --> 00:32:28.330]  Or you can purchase the MRET Activator from Cocoon Nutrition.
[00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.931]  I think so.
[00:32:48.712 --> 00:32:51.997]  Go to M-R-E-T activatedwater.com.
[00:32:52.017 --> 00:32:55.663]  That's M-R-E-T activatedwater.com.
[00:32:55.823 --> 00:32:56.344]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[00:33:09.043 --> 00:33:22.131]  Look at your young men fighting Look at your women in crying Look at your young men dying The way they've always done before
[00:33:33.571 --> 00:33:38.512]  Look at the hate we're breeding.
[00:33:38.712 --> 00:33:41.813]  Look at the fear we're feeding.
[00:33:42.193 --> 00:33:45.835]  Look at the lives we're leading.
[00:33:45.895 --> 00:33:49.016]  The way we've always done before.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.520]  And listen to this line.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.941]  He remembers when they killed the President.
[00:34:32.562 --> 00:34:34.964]  He remembers when they shot Kennedy.
[00:34:37.545 --> 00:34:39.686]  Listen to this part.
[00:34:39.766 --> 00:34:42.728]  I guess Guns N' Roses knew this, what, 15, 16, 17 years ago?
[00:34:59.377 --> 00:35:04.338]  Well, back home then, when they shot the men who said, peace could last forever.
[00:35:04.498 --> 00:35:08.079]  And in my first memories, they shot Kennedy.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:13.181]  I went numb when I learned to see, so I never felt forfeited.
[00:35:13.221 --> 00:35:21.483]  Now we've got the wall of deceit to remind us all, that you can't trust freedom when it's not in your hand.
[00:35:21.503 --> 00:35:23.984]  When everybody's fighting for their pride,
[00:35:25.384 --> 00:35:26.165]  Absolutely.
[00:35:27.646 --> 00:35:31.307]  I remember my first memories were when they shot Kennedy.
[00:35:32.528 --> 00:35:35.530]  I went numb when I learned the scene.
[00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.472]  Yeah, you don't have freedom when it's not in your hands.
[00:35:44.814 --> 00:35:47.636]  The people running this new world order are bringing down our country.
[00:35:47.656 --> 00:35:51.298]  And the people running this war are the ones getting rid of our borders and getting rid of our sovereignty.
[00:35:53.132 --> 00:35:57.975]  And they use our patriotism against us just long enough to destroy our country.
[00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:03.119]  Our name, our currency, our government, our system, everything.
[00:36:03.139 --> 00:36:05.861]  It's being destroyed right now by the New World Order.
[00:36:05.881 --> 00:36:13.726]  Alright, let me hurriedly get into the situation with Ed and Elaine Brown, then into the 9-11 intro, then I promise your calls.
[00:36:13.746 --> 00:36:19.890]  I'm told we got Julie who disagrees, Anthony wants to talk about the Browns, Steve, Ryan, Juan, everybody.
[00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:20.511]  We'll get to you.
[00:36:22.077 --> 00:36:23.058]  Four arrested.
[00:36:24.339 --> 00:36:26.601]  Four associates of Ed Brown have been arrested.
[00:36:27.481 --> 00:36:36.268]  Concord, New Hampshire Associated Press, four men accused of helping obstruct justice in the case of convicted tax evaders, Ed and Elaine Brown, have been arrested.
[00:36:36.869 --> 00:36:37.189]  U.S.
[00:36:37.309 --> 00:36:45.135]  Marshal Stephen Monier said Wednesday, and they put out more today, but it's basically the same statement, Monier said the men are
[00:36:46.807 --> 00:36:50.388]  Serino Reno Gonzalez, known as Reno, 30, of Alice, Texas.
[00:36:50.808 --> 00:36:53.249]  Daniel Riley, 40, of Albany, New York.
[00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:55.810]  Jason Gerard, 22, of Brookhaven, New York.
[00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:59.651]  And Robert Wolfe, 50, of Randolph, Vermont.
[00:37:00.031 --> 00:37:08.133]  Charges range from accessory after the fact to possession and use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.
[00:37:10.279 --> 00:37:12.841]  I don't know what that crime of violence could be.
[00:37:12.901 --> 00:37:19.787]  There hasn't been any violence out there other than the Feds tasering Riley and then shooting at him and then lying about it and now admitting to it.
[00:37:21.388 --> 00:37:23.870]  Officials, and by the way, that was an escalation.
[00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:25.692]  I don't want another Waco there.
[00:37:25.812 --> 00:37:27.633]  I don't want you going in and killing the Browns.
[00:37:28.033 --> 00:37:29.314]  You shouldn't want to go in there.
[00:37:30.055 --> 00:37:31.216]  It's over taxes!
[00:37:32.997 --> 00:37:38.662]  I mean, look, Feds, I know it's all like deer hunting for you and it's the excitement of your life and you like it and I understand all that.
[00:37:38.682 --> 00:37:39.643]  You need to go
[00:37:41.015 --> 00:37:45.278]  Get into kickboxing or ultimate fighting if you really want to get into fights, or go play paintball.
[00:37:46.378 --> 00:37:52.962]  I mean, if they had some kid kidnapped in there, or they'd robbed a bank, or they'd shot a cop, or they'd killed an old lady, go in there!
[00:37:53.923 --> 00:38:00.306]  But even if you think the tax thing is the law, you shouldn't be risking your own lives to go in there over this!
[00:38:03.948 --> 00:38:04.669]  It's stupid!
[00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:08.711]  But your bosses sure want you to go in, they sure want, and you almost did a few months ago.
[00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:11.384]  But people got wise to it so you backed off.
[00:38:11.724 --> 00:38:24.329]  You didn't have those armored vehicles all massed down the street and guys in ghillie suits all in the woods with their Remington 700s to play a game of checkers or something.
[00:38:24.369 --> 00:38:27.291]  You were there to move in.
[00:38:27.531 --> 00:38:29.712]  And the FBI doesn't want people knowing.
[00:38:30.712 --> 00:38:31.913]  They're running the whole operation.
[00:38:31.933 --> 00:38:34.734]  They don't want another black guy like they had at Waco and Ruby Ridge.
[00:38:37.102 --> 00:38:40.684]  But at the same time they want to project the image that they're in control and they're the bosses.
[00:38:41.824 --> 00:38:47.487]  You're not in control of 30 million illegal aliens in this country that are recruited into the military even when they're aggravated felons.
[00:38:48.627 --> 00:38:58.852]  You're not in control of the amnesty plan that would have given 30 million illegal aliens, and we read the subsection here on air, amnesty for not paying income taxes going back at least five years.
[00:38:59.492 --> 00:39:04.194]  MS-13 gang members with felonies to be given amnesty if they signed a pledge.
[00:39:06.221 --> 00:39:08.023]  But the Browns can't sign the pledge.
[00:39:09.124 --> 00:39:12.026]  The Browns can't plea bargain.
[00:39:12.606 --> 00:39:17.811]  The Browns can't be given a presidential pardon through Congress, like 30 million illegals were.
[00:39:18.351 --> 00:39:23.816]  No, the Browns, because they're patriots, because they know about the New World Order, they've got to be punished.
[00:39:25.123 --> 00:39:36.146]  And you sit around for years reading law enforcement magazines that say arrest people that have anti-UN stickers, and shut down protests, and the Second Amendment's bad, and you started to believe this propaganda.
[00:39:39.928 --> 00:39:46.410]  But from common sense, you shouldn't go in there.
[00:39:49.210 --> 00:39:51.131]  You shouldn't go in there after this man and woman.
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:59.243]  We should all pray for the Browns and we should also pray that God move the hearts of the federal marshals and the FBI and others.
[00:40:02.425 --> 00:40:10.970]  And that they just be like Saul of Tarsus on the road to Damascus, that they see the light and realize they're working for the wrong side.
[00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:21.316]  Now, there are some passages here in the two different articles I have from the head federal marshal in this case where he says that this has gone from being a tax case
[00:40:22.717 --> 00:40:48.910]  To make something much more serious, because of all the talk, and the patrols, and the people in the perimeter, and the .50 caliber rifles, and the talk of, and we've all heard it on the air, in the blogs, of going after feds, and the judge, and all this, after the fact, if something happens to the Browns.
[00:40:51.892 --> 00:40:56.334]  If we want to de-escalate this, that is the last thing that should have been done.
[00:40:57.855 --> 00:41:11.722]  And I've been saying that since day one with this, and now you've all heard that I'm not good, and Alex is a wimp, and we need to go ahead and have a revolution, and let's start a shooting war,
[00:41:12.722 --> 00:41:18.065]  Folks, it's going to help the New World Order if people start popping cops and start shooting judges.
[00:41:18.546 --> 00:41:21.488]  That is exactly what the Feds have been wanting all along.
[00:41:21.868 --> 00:41:29.413]  They've had to go out and infiltrate militia groups and create fake groups like Viper Militia and create Klan groups and try to get them to blow stuff up.
[00:41:29.533 --> 00:41:31.194]  They want that!
[00:41:31.747 --> 00:41:37.229]  And that's why the FBI is criminal, because you've been caught doing it over and over again, and we've covered the cases.
[00:41:37.509 --> 00:41:38.789]  It's been in mainstream news.
[00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.870]  I'm sick of your provocateuring.
[00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:47.752]  I'm tired of you trying to start a fight with the American people while we're overrun by illegal aliens.
[00:41:49.533 --> 00:42:00.977]  On the other hand, I've smelled a gigantic stinking rat surrounding this Edna Lane Brown situation from the start, and I can't ferret out exactly where it is.
[00:42:01.781 --> 00:42:03.264]  But I've got a pretty good idea.
[00:42:06.389 --> 00:42:10.175]  And that's why I didn't sit there and promote these concerts.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:31.127]  Not because they shouldn't be able to have a concert, not because they shouldn't be able to have people out there, but because folks are bringing their families and their children out there, and if adults are going out there, that's one thing, but you don't bring children into this, folks, when there's a Homeland Security helicopter over, and people in ghillie suits in the woods, a lot of them killers who like to kill people, okay?
[00:42:31.287 --> 00:42:32.467]  That's why they took the job.
[00:42:34.368 --> 00:42:39.630]  Most of them are veterans who are addicted to combat, the most addicting thing in the world, and they want more of it.
[00:42:42.651 --> 00:42:43.291]  That's simple.
[00:42:43.571 --> 00:42:45.472]  Women and children aren't involved in wars.
[00:42:45.872 --> 00:42:48.632]  And if the patriots and some people want a war, that's fine.
[00:42:49.012 --> 00:42:56.734]  But do not declare the front lines in a war a place to have women and children.
[00:42:57.874 --> 00:43:02.895]  And by me saying that's fine, that's your business, that's your life, I don't think it's a good idea.
[00:43:03.295 --> 00:43:04.076]  I don't agree with it.
[00:43:04.596 --> 00:43:10.497]  It will help the New World Order if any feds or any cops get killed.
[00:43:14.401 --> 00:43:16.663]  It means nothing to them!
[00:43:18.344 --> 00:43:33.878]  When Terence Yakey, cop of the year, exposed the feds were in there with bombs on 9-11, he was the first cop in the building, they took him out in the field and they tortured him for hours, they shot him in the back of the head, and they slid his wrist and they stabbed him all over his body and tortured him, before they killed him.
[00:43:35.739 --> 00:43:38.682]  When a local doctor who responded shot his mouth off, they killed him.
[00:43:42.242 --> 00:43:47.283]  And after all this plays out, many years from now, a lot of you Feds out there are going to wish you'd stood with the American people.
[00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:49.264]  You're going to wish you hadn't been part of all this.
[00:43:49.284 --> 00:43:50.564]  Because I know the mindset.
[00:43:50.584 --> 00:43:52.185]  I know exactly how they program you.
[00:43:52.445 --> 00:43:54.165]  I know exactly what goes through your head.
[00:44:02.607 --> 00:44:09.929]  But the worst, you know, if the Feds went in there and engaged the Browns, and God forbid did something to them, that would certainly backfire on them.
[00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:14.295]  And
[00:44:30.553 --> 00:44:47.807]  Really pushing for an end to the war, really pushing for good things, and the feds will just go in and infiltrate and start another group right beside them, and the leaders of the groups, the weathermen, you name it, they admit half of them are feds, just like the IRA, they would command them to carry out all types of terror attacks, and then they'd go in and arrest all the peaceful people.
[00:44:52.921 --> 00:44:54.802]  This is how they work and how they operate.
[00:44:55.123 --> 00:44:59.866]  And over the years watching this, I have to watch this happen over and over and over and over again.
[00:45:00.286 --> 00:45:07.911]  I have to watch people tell me, no, I'm going to dress up in camo outfits and march around and I'm going to talk about how I'm going to have armed conflict.
[00:45:08.251 --> 00:45:11.654]  And then you're surprised when the BATF buries a pipe bomb on your property.
[00:45:14.075 --> 00:45:15.116]  You played right into their hands.
[00:45:19.233 --> 00:45:24.118]  I mean, I was just out engaging in my First Amendment on the sidewalk, and I got arrested last Friday.
[00:45:24.398 --> 00:45:27.761]  I mean, you get arrested even when you don't want to get arrested, and I assure you, I didn't like it.
[00:45:28.302 --> 00:45:33.607]  I don't like having the handcuffs put on too high, where my shoulders are about to pull out of their sockets, and the cops knew what they were doing.
[00:45:33.987 --> 00:45:39.532]  I don't like having them crushed on so hard, I had bruises all over my hands, and one of them still swole up.
[00:45:39.913 --> 00:45:44.317]  I didn't like being put in a cell that had overflowed toilet with, you know what, all over the floor.
[00:45:48.032 --> 00:45:53.457]  I don't want to have this end up with the feds going in there and having a big firefight and people get killed on both sides
[00:46:13.286 --> 00:46:17.849]  And then, yeah, the atmosphere's right for... I see it happening this time.
[00:46:18.169 --> 00:46:23.472]  I think you're going to end up getting some feds killed after the fact, which is horrible.
[00:46:24.412 --> 00:46:27.494]  Again, does nothing for the cause of liberty and freedom.
[00:46:28.135 --> 00:46:31.456]  They'll now have poster children on the news, which, you feds better be smart.
[00:46:31.837 --> 00:46:33.538]  That's exactly what you're being set up for.
[00:46:33.838 --> 00:46:34.998]  You're expendable in all this.
[00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:35.719]  You're being used.
[00:46:42.865 --> 00:46:47.246]  And then they're just going to have more checkpoints and more crackdowns and more patriots being arrested.
[00:46:49.327 --> 00:46:58.530]  And then all after the fact, you're going to find out a bunch of the people shooting their mouths off, calling for war, are going to be Feds.
[00:47:02.191 --> 00:47:10.033]  Just like with the incident at the Ugandan airport in the mid-70s with Idi Amin, when they sent in the Israeli commandos at the airport,
[00:47:12.463 --> 00:47:17.006]  And a bunch of them got killed, including Netanyahu's brother?
[00:47:17.026 --> 00:47:20.508]  Oh, that was real for them!
[00:47:20.868 --> 00:47:28.853]  But now the Jerusalem Post and the BBC report, the documents have been declassified, that it was staged.
[00:47:29.273 --> 00:47:40.440]  That through Mossad, Idi Amin was funded to stage that, to then send in commandos and get them killed, to then demonize the peace process that was ongoing and try to blind the PLO.
[00:47:42.341 --> 00:47:43.861]  See, this is sophisticated.
[00:47:44.582 --> 00:47:49.103]  And these FBI agents and marshals, you're just like the Israeli commandos.
[00:47:49.803 --> 00:47:51.603]  Make no mistake.
[00:47:52.883 --> 00:47:59.545]  Oh, and the kidnappers there at the airport, they thought they were doing good.
[00:47:59.565 --> 00:48:02.726]  And I'm not comparing apples and oranges.
[00:48:02.766 --> 00:48:04.806]  I'm not comparing the Browns to those people.
[00:48:04.826 --> 00:48:05.807]  The Browns are being attacked.
[00:48:05.847 --> 00:48:06.467]  They've done nothing.
[00:48:06.707 --> 00:48:07.467]  They've been surrounded.
[00:48:07.487 --> 00:48:08.667]  I understand their psychology.
[00:48:09.167 --> 00:48:11.168]  I understand why they're saying what they're saying.
[00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:14.797]  I have a response.
[00:48:14.817 --> 00:48:17.618]  I mean, it's so amazing that I'm able to predict terror attacks.
[00:48:17.678 --> 00:48:20.138]  I'm able to break down what's going to be in the President's speech.
[00:48:20.278 --> 00:48:21.478]  I know their modus operandi.
[00:48:21.518 --> 00:48:22.819]  I understand their game plan.
[00:48:23.139 --> 00:48:24.279]  I've got a pretty good mind.
[00:48:24.339 --> 00:48:26.239]  I've been intensely studying this for years.
[00:48:27.699 --> 00:48:29.360]  And I give people advice all day long.
[00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:32.140]  Advice is valuable.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:39.281]  Other patriots, other truth-tellers, other people in the truth movement, the freedom movement, libertarians, whatever you want to call it, all those groups.
[00:48:39.701 --> 00:48:43.202]  And people hardly ever listen to any advice I give them.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:46.060]  They don't!
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:46.720]  They don't listen!
[00:48:48.541 --> 00:48:50.482]  They've always got it all figured out!
[00:48:54.243 --> 00:48:55.583]  They always know everything!
[00:48:59.505 --> 00:49:06.067]  And they get sucked into a macho... macho mentality of shooting their mouth off.
[00:49:07.508 --> 00:49:08.408]  I mean, here's an example.
[00:49:08.468 --> 00:49:14.490]  People at events out at the Browns will all just sit around campfires with their guns with the woods right there.
[00:49:16.463 --> 00:49:26.628]  That means if the Feds wanted to move in when that was happening, that you'd already have a gun in your hand, and they could then argue that they had a right to sniper every single one of you sitting there.
[00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:33.151]  And that's what they do.
[00:49:37.253 --> 00:49:38.013]  You understand that?
[00:49:41.395 --> 00:49:43.876]  I mean, that's the craziest thing I've ever heard of.
[00:49:47.148 --> 00:49:50.850]  I mean, it's one thing if people that are out there and committed and are going to stay and want to have an Alamo.
[00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:53.771]  If they want to do that, that is their prerogative.
[00:49:54.832 --> 00:50:12.160]  But if you just think this is like you're going on a tourist trip, and this is like you're visiting some folk event, and so you're going to put on lederhosen when you go out to the little German town,
[00:50:12.916 --> 00:50:15.557]  Or a Polish outfit, because you're going to get into the scene.
[00:50:15.877 --> 00:50:17.937]  Hey, this isn't a carnival, okay?
[00:50:18.697 --> 00:50:19.618]  This is life and death.
[00:50:20.618 --> 00:50:24.579]  And this thing could spiral out of control any time.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.181]  When I've been in similar situations trying to defuse things, like with the Gray family in North Texas.
[00:50:33.881 --> 00:50:36.381]  They had COINTELPRO in there telling them not to trust me, of course.
[00:50:38.582 --> 00:50:39.262]  I didn't have a gun.
[00:50:41.411 --> 00:50:43.313]  Because I'm not a combatant in this.
[00:50:44.114 --> 00:50:47.237]  And if they're gonna kill me, they're gonna martyr me.
[00:50:47.257 --> 00:50:49.980]  You understand that?
[00:50:50.481 --> 00:50:53.244]  You only face what you take with you.
[00:51:04.506 --> 00:51:07.708]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.048 --> 00:51:09.990]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:17.995]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:18.692 --> 00:51:25.734]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.135 --> 00:51:37.558]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.858 --> 00:51:41.420]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.760]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:44.101 --> 00:51:47.942]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:03.064 --> 00:52:07.567]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:52:07.908 --> 00:52:12.011]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:52:12.291 --> 00:52:12.851]  We listened.
[00:52:13.151 --> 00:52:18.135]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:52:18.415 --> 00:52:18.896]  We listened.
[00:52:19.276 --> 00:52:22.318]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:52:22.738 --> 00:52:23.259]  We listened.
[00:52:23.719 --> 00:52:27.782]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:52:28.182 --> 00:52:28.663]  We listened.
[00:52:29.003 --> 00:52:34.246]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.028]  Again, we listened.
[00:52:36.368 --> 00:52:37.949]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[00:52:38.149 --> 00:52:43.713]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:52:44.153 --> 00:52:46.794]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[00:52:46.994 --> 00:52:47.194]  Only $279.

[00:54:03.709 --> 00:54:05.651]  In constant sorrow, through his days,
[00:54:24.533 --> 00:54:28.917]  I'm the man of constant sorrow.
[00:54:29.037 --> 00:54:35.642]  I've seen trouble all my days.
[00:54:35.722 --> 00:54:42.487]  I'm a bit fairway healthy boy, Kentucky.
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:47.942]  The place where I was born and raised.
[00:54:47.982 --> 00:54:50.683]  The place where he was born and raised.
[00:55:12.561 --> 00:55:17.185]  Six long years I've been in trouble.
[00:55:17.285 --> 00:55:22.050]  No pleasure here on earth I found.
[00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:24.112]  Born in this world.
[00:55:34.762 --> 00:55:41.184]  Welcome back.
[00:55:46.945 --> 00:55:47.385]  Alright.
[00:55:48.245 --> 00:55:52.586]  I've covered much of the Brown case.
[00:55:52.686 --> 00:55:53.667]  A local loss tonight.
[00:55:55.827 --> 00:55:57.727]  A friend of mine, I've gotten to know him over the last year.
[00:55:57.747 --> 00:55:59.068]  Seen him at events for several.
[00:56:01.028 --> 00:56:02.289]  Just doing camera work.
[00:56:03.329 --> 00:56:03.989]  Terry Melton.
[00:56:05.012 --> 00:56:05.512]  We're good to go.
[00:56:27.333 --> 00:56:29.234]  According to their skewed parameters.
[00:56:29.714 --> 00:56:30.735]  The bottom line is this.
[00:56:31.235 --> 00:56:35.957]  The Feds go around trying to stir militia groups up and stir other groups up and create groups in many cases.
[00:56:36.417 --> 00:56:39.179]  Trying to get them to carry out violent acts because they need it and they want it.
[00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:42.620]  And I've got to tell you from past M.O.'
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.022]  's I've seen where they wanted instant confrontations.
[00:56:45.562 --> 00:56:51.825]  I'm seeing these Federal Marshals, I don't agree with what they're doing, but I've been seeing them taking a little bit different approach from that.
[00:56:54.691 --> 00:56:59.412]  At least up until they flew that helicopter over the last party they had, the Homeland Security helicopter.
[00:56:59.432 --> 00:57:00.932]  That was a clear provocation.
[00:57:01.352 --> 00:57:02.853]  Then you had the shooting in the woods.
[00:57:04.393 --> 00:57:08.074]  All of it's just bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[00:57:10.874 --> 00:57:20.636]  But, historically, the Marshals and the Feds are such snakes that... I was thinking about this morning, getting on the telephone and trying to call these guys up.
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:22.361]  We've tried to call the sheriff.
[00:57:22.381 --> 00:57:23.182]  I've tried to get a hold of him.
[00:57:23.222 --> 00:57:24.643]  Jack McClain's talked to him before.
[00:57:25.403 --> 00:57:26.904]  I just don't know where all this is going.
[00:57:27.425 --> 00:57:34.650]  It just, basically every avenue I look down, every possible future, probable future here, ends very badly.
[00:57:35.411 --> 00:57:37.172]  And it ends very badly for the feds.
[00:57:37.933 --> 00:57:42.096]  I know that's why the FBI's trying to keep their name out of all this, but their names are out there and it's known.
[00:57:48.211 --> 00:57:49.531]  We'll talk to listeners next hour.
[00:57:49.551 --> 00:57:51.392]  I'll go to your calls immediately when we start the next hour.
[00:57:51.472 --> 00:57:54.973]  Then I'll get into 9-11 and the huge developments there.
[00:57:55.554 --> 00:57:56.634]  Just so important.
[00:57:57.694 --> 00:58:01.856]  So many areas that I want to get into in the next hour.
[00:58:01.896 --> 00:58:03.336]  But I'm going to move to your calls quickly, folks.
[00:58:03.556 --> 00:58:06.557]  We don't have a long time to ramble and battle on like I tend to do.
[00:58:07.258 --> 00:58:13.580]  I just want to hear your take on what's happening with the Browns, your take on the 9-11, if you were there for the 6th anniversary, what you saw, what you witnessed.
[00:58:15.515 --> 00:58:16.776]  We're going to move on to the next person.
[00:58:16.796 --> 00:58:17.136]  Okay?
[00:58:17.156 --> 00:58:18.796]  I'm going to take three calls in the next five-minute segment.
[00:58:19.237 --> 00:58:21.057]  And I'm going to take about six, seven calls in that next segment.
[00:58:21.598 --> 00:58:30.862]  I'm going to get through your calls, and I'm going to get into 9-11 first responder, her WTC7 countdown demolition, and all the other witnesses we've integrated into this one story.
[00:58:31.522 --> 00:58:37.664]  And I challenge people to look at this story, read it, check out the facts, and then tell me the Globalist didn't blow up that building.
[00:58:38.165 --> 00:58:38.785]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.897 --> 00:58:46.947]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:46.967 --> 00:58:47.108]  Hello?
[00:58:57.711 --> 00:58:58.371]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.031 --> 00:59:00.072]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.792 --> 00:59:01.892]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.572 --> 00:59:03.372]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.133 --> 00:59:05.013]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.033 --> 00:59:09.434]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.874 --> 00:59:13.995]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.995 --> 00:59:17.356]  We are now into our number two.
[00:59:17.376 --> 00:59:21.737]  There have been four arrests, four aiding and abetting, obstructing justice, you name it.
[00:59:24.585 --> 00:59:29.788]  That is coming up concerning the Elaine Brown tax case up in New Hampshire outside Plainfield.
[00:59:30.548 --> 00:59:31.689]  Taking your calls right now on that.
[00:59:31.729 --> 00:59:35.791]  Coming up later, 9-11 First Responder, her WTC7 demolition countdown.
[00:59:35.851 --> 00:59:36.812]  Very important news.
[00:59:37.292 --> 00:59:40.954]  Right now, let's talk to Anthony in Arizona and Steve Bryan, Juan and others.
[00:59:41.394 --> 00:59:42.455]  Anthony, you're on the air.
[00:59:42.495 --> 00:59:42.855]  Welcome.
[00:59:43.576 --> 00:59:47.438]  Hi, I just wanted to comment on the Elaine and the Brown... Elaine and...
[00:59:48.556 --> 00:59:50.477]  Ed Brown situation.
[00:59:50.497 --> 01:00:00.041]  For all the idiots out there who want to start a shooting war, let me just remind you that this is high-tech, okay?
[01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:08.624]  These people have spy satellites on the population, they have infrared, they have night vision, they can pinpoint your location.
[01:00:08.864 --> 01:00:13.386]  If you're hiding under a rock, and that's not how it's done, folks,
[01:00:14.187 --> 01:00:17.392]  What people need to understand is it's a mind war.
[01:00:17.453 --> 01:00:17.953]  It's an info war.
[01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:18.394]  It's simple.
[01:00:18.434 --> 01:00:22.061]  We're winning the info war so they won't escalate it into a shooting war.
[01:00:22.862 --> 01:00:24.723]  Well, that's exactly like you're saying.
[01:00:25.203 --> 01:00:27.744]  You know, you're playing into the hands of the enemy.
[01:00:27.944 --> 01:00:28.745]  That's what they want.
[01:00:29.285 --> 01:00:44.512]  They want, when half of the population is now asleep, they want a shooting war because they know that half the population is going to follow the propaganda on the TV, on the news, and the other half are going to be marginalized, and they win.
[01:00:45.092 --> 01:00:45.953]  That's how they win.
[01:00:46.233 --> 01:00:52.278]  Well, and that's what's happening now, because they know when you reach half, and we've reached that, that we're soon going to convert to reality the other half.
[01:00:52.338 --> 01:00:53.919]  They're in desperate damage control mode.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.524]  Also, you know, to remind everybody, just, you know, just, here's a reality check.
[01:01:00.325 --> 01:01:06.510]  If you go up against, you know, such overwhelming force, you're asking for it.
[01:01:07.105 --> 01:01:11.608]  So, you know, this is not how it's done, and that's the last resort.
[01:01:12.208 --> 01:01:15.610]  The last, the absolute last resort.
[01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:20.553]  But it is the last resort for Ed and Elaine Brown now, because they were wrongfully convicted.
[01:01:20.573 --> 01:01:23.715]  The IRS is a fraud, and people are trying to defend them.
[01:01:24.095 --> 01:01:32.200]  My whole point is here, we don't want to preemptively escalate all this into the next phase, and we need cooler minds to prevail on both sides.
[01:01:32.904 --> 01:01:35.006]  Well, Alex, you know, you're absolutely right.
[01:01:35.026 --> 01:01:38.950]  That's some of the best, you know, advice I've heard from any person.
[01:01:39.431 --> 01:01:52.584]  But before I go, I just want to ask you just one question about, I want your take on the Air Force standing down this Friday, the entire Air Force, the fighter jets and the bombers standing down.
[01:01:52.644 --> 01:01:53.665]  What is your take on that?
[01:01:54.307 --> 01:01:56.268]  Steve Watson has done detailed analysis.
[01:01:56.328 --> 01:02:03.132]  I've been marching around protesting for four days in New York and read some news on the internet a few nights, but don't know much.
[01:02:03.413 --> 01:02:07.095]  There's a story up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.net on the right hand side.
[01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:12.278]  In the news and focus section, false flag terror fears on 14th is apparent hoax.
[01:02:14.722 --> 01:02:24.327]  It goes on to say, a military stand-down scheduled for this Friday has kick-started a buzz across the blogosphere that some kind of false flag attack may be planned in the immediate aftermath of the 6th anniversary.
[01:02:24.387 --> 01:02:29.470]  Wild connections and suggestions have started to be made that have little or no basis in reality.
[01:02:30.071 --> 01:02:37.575]  A disconcerting trend that can be damaging the 9-11 truth movement and those who have set out to expose false flag terrorism for real.
[01:02:38.135 --> 01:02:50.586]  Earlier this week, the Air Force Times reported that September 14th air combat command bases, consisting of about 100,000 active duty airmen, would be standing down training flights and many other operations as part of a country-wide safety day.
[01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:57.572]  And that means that they're going to go over safety and double-checking all the equipment, and that's pretty routine from the research Steve's done.
[01:02:57.852 --> 01:03:04.538]  But I was trying to read over this this morning, and you can go there and find full details there on InfoWars.net.
[01:03:05.498 --> 01:03:15.809]  Well, you know, Alex, the thing that you listeners have to be reminded of time and time again is, you know, this is a well-planned effort against the American people.
[01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:25.360]  These people on the other side, the enemy against us, who are trying to destroy our Constitution, our representative form of government, they know what they're doing.
[01:03:26.067 --> 01:03:32.248]  And all it takes is one trigger-happy idiot to go out and ruin it for everybody.
[01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:34.369]  Well, I mean, it'll take more than that.
[01:03:34.429 --> 01:03:37.009]  But if it starts going, it's gonna be bad.
[01:03:37.049 --> 01:03:38.529]  I mean, I appreciate your call.
[01:03:38.570 --> 01:03:40.230]  People are sick and tired of being sick and tired.
[01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:42.450]  And I'm not saying they don't have a reason to be mad.
[01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:44.631]  I mean, this thing can powder keg really fast.
[01:03:45.431 --> 01:03:47.531]  And that's what I'm worried about.
[01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:50.992]  And this Ed and Elaine Brown thing's got the best chance of being the trigger for it.
[01:03:54.384 --> 01:04:03.452]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:04:03.712 --> 01:04:14.942]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:04:15.283 --> 01:04:20.107]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:04:20.247 --> 01:04:20.527]  I think so.
[01:04:39.318 --> 01:04:42.442]  Just get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:04:43.243 --> 01:04:44.164]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:04:44.184 --> 01:04:44.965]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:46.527]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:04:56.287 --> 01:05:01.753]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.113 --> 01:05:09.761]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.447 --> 01:05:17.513]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:17.913 --> 01:05:29.322]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.663 --> 01:05:33.165]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:35.547]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:35.868 --> 01:05:39.711]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.812 --> 01:06:00.976]  Hi, I'm David, and if you wake up at night to urinate like I was, then you'll want to take advantage of this special risk-free offer.
[01:06:01.196 --> 01:06:09.201]  If you have dribbling, burning, or pain during or after urination, then you may have a condition known as benign prostate enlargement.
[01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:12.123]  This is potentially serious and can get worse with age.

[01:06:19.107 --> 01:06:23.649]  Beta Prostate contains natural ingredients that help support a healthy prostate.

[01:06:53.989 --> 01:06:59.591]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:00.351 --> 01:07:05.512]  Alright, I promised to get through your calls, and we are, but Jack McClan, I wanted to get him on later, but he could only join us now.
[01:07:05.532 --> 01:07:07.333]  He has important appointments he has to go to.
[01:07:07.953 --> 01:07:18.836]  For 27 years, he's had Aid and Abet newsletter, police and military against the New World Order, tens of thousands of members across the country, and they're there educating policemen, military men and women,
[01:07:20.385 --> 01:07:23.668]  I'm going to get to Steve, Brian, Juan, and others coming up.
[01:07:23.708 --> 01:07:26.490]  Jack's only with us for this segment, so I promise we're going to get to all of you.
[01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:27.351]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:07:27.671 --> 01:07:28.752]  Tons of calls coming up.
[01:07:29.392 --> 01:07:32.014]  From day one, I've said I'm trying to de-escalate.
[01:07:32.075 --> 01:07:35.297]  I'm trying to get the Browns to talk.
[01:07:35.397 --> 01:07:37.079]  I'm trying to get the Feds to talk.
[01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:38.620]  I'm trying to get the Feds to back down.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:41.722]  That's when we came in and said, do not rush in there.
[01:07:41.762 --> 01:07:43.364]  Do not kill them.
[01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:47.867]  The Browns have gotten the most notoriety and attention, and I've got them on coast-to-coast AM.
[01:07:47.887 --> 01:07:48.788]  I've only tried to help them.
[01:07:49.582 --> 01:08:03.073]  But with my advice, and with the spotlight I've had to shine on this, I've also said that I've seen it over and over again with the militias and everybody else, where there's all this talk and then people get killed or people go to prison.
[01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:12.020]  And now this has a chance of really escalating because the country's so awake now because of our work, all of you out there, that the country wants to have a fight with the feds.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:17.024]  And we're having such an effect in the info war right now that I've been trying to de-escalate
[01:08:17.657 --> 01:08:18.578]  And stop this from happening.
[01:08:18.598 --> 01:08:23.321]  That's why the Feds carry out terror attacks, is because they want to escalate it into a violent zone.
[01:08:23.641 --> 01:08:24.942]  They want to declare martial law.
[01:08:24.982 --> 01:08:26.583]  The PDD 51 has been signed.
[01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:28.164]  It's all locked and loaded and ready.
[01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:38.031]  And just basic strategy from every angle, every avenue I look down, it's best to keep this from escalating to any type of armed confrontation.
[01:08:38.951 --> 01:08:39.712]  With both sides.
[01:08:40.392 --> 01:08:43.875]  And now they've arrested four people, the AP reports,
[01:08:45.501 --> 01:08:47.242]  Four associates of Ed Brown arrested.
[01:08:47.282 --> 01:08:50.484]  Four men accused of helping obstruct justice in the case of convicted tax evaders.
[01:08:50.544 --> 01:08:51.825]  Ed and Elaine Brown have been arrested.
[01:08:51.925 --> 01:08:52.106]  U.S.
[01:08:52.166 --> 01:08:58.950]  Marshal Steven Monier said yesterday, Monier said the men are Serino Reno Gonzalez, 30, of Alice, Texas.
[01:08:58.990 --> 01:09:00.671]  Daniel Riley, 40, of Albany, New York.
[01:09:01.092 --> 01:09:03.193]  Jason Gerard, 22, of Brookhaven, New York.
[01:09:03.493 --> 01:09:05.655]  And Robert Wolfe, 50, of Randolph, Vermont.
[01:09:06.195 --> 01:09:14.621]  Charges reign from accessory after the fact of possession and use of a firearm in retaliation and in relation to a crime of violence.
[01:09:15.865 --> 01:09:17.626]  Jack McClan, what does that sound like to you?
[01:09:19.386 --> 01:09:23.527]  Well, Alex, it doesn't sound good at all, brother.
[01:09:24.268 --> 01:09:41.953]  What we don't want to have happen in America right now, because we're winning, using the First Amendment to awaken so many people, is we don't want violence to start, because if it's on our side, then immediately we'll be under martial law,
[01:09:43.027 --> 01:09:51.751]  And Bush has the foreign troops and he's got all the people ready to go, the soldiers ready to go.
[01:09:51.831 --> 01:09:56.813]  We're getting reports that soldiers are being trained right now for martial law in America.
[01:09:56.833 --> 01:10:02.996]  And whole battalions are being prepared for martial law in America.
[01:10:03.816 --> 01:10:09.279]  We're praying that God will grant us the First Amendment for some time yet because we're winning.
[01:10:10.079 --> 01:10:12.400]  And if any of us start shooting,
[01:10:13.605 --> 01:10:26.663]  Uh, Alex, it's going to be terrible because Bush will declare martial law and say we're all Al-Qaeda or domestic terrorists, which they've already listed as that, and that we've got to be cleaned out.
[01:10:27.987 --> 01:10:30.709]  We'll be under martial law and the First Amendment will be gone forever.
[01:10:30.729 --> 01:10:35.153]  And then that will escalate, that will then escalate an even bigger response.
[01:10:35.653 --> 01:10:45.561]  If only 1% of the American people who are gun owners fight of 150 million gun owners, that's 1.5 million soldiers, combatants in a guerrilla war the globalists can't win.
[01:10:45.601 --> 01:10:48.824]  All this talk about, they're so high-tech, we can't beat them.
[01:10:49.404 --> 01:10:56.130]  Small groups individually can't beat them, but if it does start a guerrilla insurgency, which believe me folks, I've looked at it, could really start.
[01:10:56.730 --> 01:11:02.136]  In that next phase, you're going to have the police and military wiped out, and then now we've got... I was wrong.
[01:11:02.756 --> 01:11:10.564]  Endgame, you know, the part that was made a few months ago in the middle of the film about over 140,000 foreign troops now in our military.
[01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:14.088]  AP two weeks ago reported, too late for me to put it in the film,
[01:11:15.789 --> 01:11:19.151]  100,000 non-Americans now in the forces.
[01:11:19.451 --> 01:11:20.712]  Folks, that's over a third.
[01:11:21.092 --> 01:11:29.497]  We're talking about record levels, and we've now discovered that they're holding back most of those units made up entirely of Mexicans.
[01:11:29.957 --> 01:11:31.278]  They're in Mexican units.
[01:11:31.338 --> 01:11:33.619]  They're in Nicaraguan, El Salvadoran units.
[01:11:34.179 --> 01:11:35.780]  And that's the main force.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.282]  Then you've got groups made up out of Czechoslovakian.
[01:11:39.522 --> 01:11:41.163]  You've got groups made up of Ukrainian.
[01:11:41.183 --> 01:11:42.584]  This is now mainstream news, by the way.
[01:11:43.164 --> 01:11:54.608]  You've got groups made up, of course, of Filipino, and they will... Jack, please speak to the feds, though, about being calm.
[01:11:54.948 --> 01:11:56.868]  I don't think they understand how they're being set up.
[01:11:58.089 --> 01:11:59.129]  No, they sure don't.
[01:11:59.369 --> 01:12:00.730]  All of them are being set up.
[01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:07.452]  I deal with brainwashed federal agents every week here that we communicate with.
[01:12:07.772 --> 01:12:11.513]  Our state police and local police are totally brainwashed.
[01:12:12.509 --> 01:12:23.796]  And they believe that we have Al Qaeda and we have domestic terrorists among us and all Bush has to do is point his finger at us and they're going to come in on us and kill us or try to.
[01:12:24.616 --> 01:12:40.986]  And so we've got to keep the calm, Alex, as long as we can because, as you said, they are so afraid if they can't get us shooting, get us in the shooting war soon, that we're going to overcome them and we are!
[01:12:41.567 --> 01:13:03.475]  You know, and so, by keeping calm and utilizing the First Amendment, and praying that God doesn't allow Bush and his criminal cronies to do another false flag operation in America, we still have time to awaken hundreds of thousands, if not millions, more Americans onto the side of God and liberty.
[01:13:03.595 --> 01:13:08.817]  And that's why they're in a race to go ahead and escalate something now, because they know the clock is running out on them.
[01:13:08.837 --> 01:13:10.958]  All these scandals, all this corruption's coming out.
[01:13:11.949 --> 01:13:12.429]  That's right.
[01:13:12.469 --> 01:13:23.457]  They want us to start shooting and I have soldiers and police officers contacting me weekly here thinking it's time we should go get our guns and start marching on Washington.
[01:13:24.298 --> 01:13:25.379]  Totally irrational.
[01:13:26.479 --> 01:13:28.361]  But they're so frustrated.
[01:13:29.021 --> 01:13:31.943]  They're so frustrated to see what's going on with their country.
[01:13:32.323 --> 01:13:38.768]  They're being sent out of the country to bring democracy to nations which are not
[01:13:39.266 --> 01:13:41.467]  That don't have anything to do with America at all.
[01:13:41.727 --> 01:13:43.648]  Whoever shoots first.
[01:13:43.789 --> 01:13:51.913]  We're losing our freedoms here in America and the police and soldiers that I deal with are totally frustrated and want to go clean out, clean house.
[01:13:52.293 --> 01:13:53.534]  Whoever shoots first.
[01:13:53.574 --> 01:13:54.254]  Don't do it!
[01:13:54.415 --> 01:13:55.075]  Don't do it!
[01:13:55.695 --> 01:14:01.819]  Jack, do you agree that whoever shoots first loses and then whoever has the coolest brain is going to win?
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:05.841]  Well, it's always been that way in a fight.
[01:14:06.673 --> 01:14:26.987]  You know, whenever you get in a fist fight with somebody, but I believe that if this war does get going tomorrow, which God, I pray it doesn't to God, but if it did, I still think we'd win in the end, Alex, because we've got millions and millions and millions of Americans.
[01:14:27.568 --> 01:14:28.568]  Oh yeah, there's no doubt.
[01:14:28.628 --> 01:14:29.309]  There's no doubt.
[01:14:29.349 --> 01:14:33.452]  It's just we're going to, the longer we can hold, the bigger the victory and the faster.
[01:14:34.318 --> 01:14:45.825]  That's right, and the more people we have on our side awake, and every week, I don't know if you have an estimate or not, but I'd say 100,000 people a week, if not more, are waking up.
[01:14:46.645 --> 01:14:48.046]  I agree with that number.
[01:14:49.027 --> 01:15:03.515]  And so, we need weeks yet, and months yet, and so what they want us to do is they want to instigate something like with the Browns for us to start shooting, and once that starts,
[01:15:04.192 --> 01:15:11.657]  We're going to have momentum moving through the Patriot community of others who want to pick up their guns and go, because I talk to them all the time.
[01:15:12.478 --> 01:15:16.041]  And so, that's exactly what they're trying to push us into, Alex.
[01:15:16.141 --> 01:15:25.487]  It's a fool's game, because we're winning our non-violent redress right now, and they don't want to allow that to happen, of course.
[01:15:27.029 --> 01:15:29.190]  Basically, they want to overturn the chessboard.
[01:15:29.891 --> 01:15:30.111]  Right.
[01:15:30.611 --> 01:15:30.811]  Yeah.
[01:15:32.202 --> 01:15:32.402]  Yes.
[01:15:45.177 --> 01:15:46.818]  Hopefully, stop everything.
[01:15:47.379 --> 01:16:05.753]  In closing, Jack McClam, can you speak specifically to the Feds that are listening right now, who are being given orders to clearly escalate this with the helicopter a few months ago, and the people in the woods, and now arresting four people that have been friends with the Browns.
[01:16:06.273 --> 01:16:08.014]  That's a clear escalation.
[01:16:08.034 --> 01:16:09.476]  Do you have any advice for them?
[01:16:09.536 --> 01:16:11.137]  Because I clearly see this as a trap.
[01:16:12.004 --> 01:16:13.845]  It truly is.
[01:16:14.205 --> 01:16:14.925]  It truly is.
[01:16:15.045 --> 01:16:22.368]  All of you federal agents out there, and some of you we speak to every month here at our two-fleet military association.
[01:16:23.369 --> 01:16:28.330]  I just want to tell you that this system that's being set up, you're not aware of it.
[01:16:28.791 --> 01:16:30.391]  You think you see the big picture.
[01:16:30.431 --> 01:16:34.573]  You're told you see the big picture, and the private citizens don't.
[01:16:35.213 --> 01:16:37.514]  But that's not true, brothers and sisters out there.
[01:16:38.055 --> 01:16:42.277]  What this is, is a system of the super-rich and the super-poor.
[01:16:42.297 --> 01:16:42.978]  And guess who?
[01:16:43.478 --> 01:16:48.861]  You don't qualify for the super-rich there, federal agents, brother and sister agents out there.
[01:16:48.881 --> 01:16:55.024]  So, your families are going to be enslaved and America is going to be destroyed.
[01:16:55.584 --> 01:17:00.086]  And you're going to be so sorry for the part you played in that, but it's going to be too late.
[01:17:00.847 --> 01:17:04.889]  So I just tell you to step back and study and read and listen.
[01:17:05.464 --> 01:17:13.930]  Listen to GCN, listen to Alex Jones, Jack Blood, these programs for a few weeks, federal agents, and you will know the truth.
[01:17:14.150 --> 01:17:16.511]  And the truth will set us free here in America.
[01:17:17.152 --> 01:17:20.534]  So I'm just warning you, don't be conned.
[01:17:20.634 --> 01:17:22.035]  You're being conned right now.
[01:17:22.135 --> 01:17:23.716]  We talk to you every week here.
[01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:33.523]  And it's very sad that we have so many of our brothers and sisters that we haven't been able to reach yet.
[01:17:34.079 --> 01:17:47.123]  The vast majority we haven't reached yet that are just totally brainwashed into thinking you, Alex, and me, and those of us that are the true patriots in America today, active patriots in America, are the enemy of this nation.
[01:17:47.744 --> 01:17:52.145]  And they're told we're trying to use the Constitution to destroy America.
[01:17:52.785 --> 01:17:53.846]  And it is not true!
[01:17:54.846 --> 01:17:57.807]  But that's what our police and soldiers are being told.
[01:18:00.473 --> 01:18:05.915]  I was on the plane with an airline pilot yesterday, and we talked for four hours.
[01:18:07.296 --> 01:18:12.018]  He was a really smart guy, but by the end of it, I started convincing him, because I knew so much history.
[01:18:12.478 --> 01:18:14.079]  He said, I don't even talk to most people.
[01:18:14.099 --> 01:18:15.319]  He was reading the big thick history books.
[01:18:15.659 --> 01:18:18.380]  Well, we started talking, and I knew all about it, and he was pretty amazed.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:20.261]  He said, most people didn't know about history.
[01:18:20.981 --> 01:18:22.882]  He was reading a thousand year history of the Greeks.
[01:18:25.623 --> 01:18:29.186]  I just got really into the mindset of these guys and the psychology in that discussion.
[01:18:29.546 --> 01:18:30.947]  I'm going to talk about that later if I have time.
[01:18:31.187 --> 01:18:31.967]  Calls are coming up.
[01:18:32.007 --> 01:18:33.629]  Jack McClam, thanks for popping in with us.
[01:18:34.029 --> 01:18:34.689]  Okay, brother.
[01:18:34.729 --> 01:18:37.031]  God bless you for all you're doing for America.
[01:18:37.691 --> 01:18:40.473]  Just keep your powder dry, but keep calm.
[01:18:41.174 --> 01:18:44.276]  And don't be pushed into a violent confrontation.
[01:18:44.316 --> 01:18:44.756]  I agree.
[01:18:44.956 --> 01:18:45.477]  I agree.
[01:18:45.657 --> 01:18:46.057]  Take care.
[01:18:46.317 --> 01:18:48.339]  Yeah, they want to push us into defending ourselves.
[01:18:49.339 --> 01:18:49.840]  That's what they want.
[01:18:53.863 --> 01:18:59.086]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:18:59.226 --> 01:19:07.309]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:19:07.570 --> 01:19:14.613]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:19:14.813 --> 01:19:16.094]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:19:16.154 --> 01:19:22.059]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:19:22.259 --> 01:19:27.343]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:19:27.443 --> 01:19:36.330]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:40.113]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:19:41.834 --> 01:19:42.114]  I think?
[01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:55.683]  This is a market alert from Midas Resources.
[01:19:56.063 --> 01:20:06.047]  Since August 9th, the Fed has created and injected $200 billion into the financial markets to keep them afloat, ignoring the hyperinflationary hangover that is the sure result.
[01:20:06.547 --> 01:20:12.069]  Data released by the New York Federal Reserve shows that foreign central banks have cut their stash of U.S.
[01:20:12.129 --> 01:20:18.812]  Treasuries by $48 billion since late July, with falls of $32 billion in the last two weeks alone.
[01:20:19.312 --> 01:20:21.313]  Could China be quietly dumping the dollar?
[01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:29.382]  The quality of your life depends on the quality of your currency, and the quality of the dollar is poor, because the quantity is so high.
[01:20:29.742 --> 01:20:35.547]  Printing money out of thin air has disastrous results, victimizing middle-class citizens and discouraging savings.
[01:20:36.108 --> 01:20:40.611]  If you have been considering precious metals as a hedge against inflation, you need to act now.
[01:20:41.012 --> 01:20:43.574]  Procrastination is the mother of lost opportunities.
[01:20:44.034 --> 01:20:46.195]  Call me, Tom Andrew at 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:47.696 --> 01:20:52.559]  That's 1-800-606-1294.
[01:20:53.479 --> 01:20:58.962]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:20:59.403 --> 01:21:03.625]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:21:04.045 --> 01:21:10.909]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:21:11.349 --> 01:21:18.051]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:21:18.371 --> 01:21:19.992]  There are no reported side effects.
[01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.473]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:21:23.733 --> 01:21:26.194]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[01:21:26.494 --> 01:21:33.236]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:21:33.676 --> 01:21:36.359]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:21:40.044 --> 01:21:40.404]  That's 866-885-6625.
[01:21:40.424 --> 01:21:42.227]  Once again, that's 866-885-6625 for BioSolutions.
[01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:55.747]  Oh, what a beautiful day for the beach!
[01:21:56.208 --> 01:21:56.488]  Look!
[01:21:56.888 --> 01:21:57.929]  Up there in the sky!
[01:21:57.949 --> 01:21:59.690]  It's Non-X-Man!
[01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:01.191]  He's in a dive!
[01:22:01.211 --> 01:22:03.513]  He must have found some ugly toenails on the beach!
[01:22:03.813 --> 01:22:04.594]  Let's go look!
[01:22:06.815 --> 01:22:09.997]  I'm Non-X-Man and your toenails need Non-X nail gel!
[01:22:10.417 --> 01:22:11.758]  Stop hiding them in the sand!
[01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:12.379]  Take them out!
[01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.710]  Let's see.
[01:22:13.730 --> 01:22:18.293]  Oh, I'm so embarrassed.
[01:22:18.653 --> 01:22:19.113]  Don't worry.
[01:22:19.573 --> 01:22:21.094]  Now there's Non-X Nail Gel.
[01:22:21.714 --> 01:22:26.137]  Use it on your toenails regularly and they'll look fantastic when you're barefoot.
[01:22:26.677 --> 01:22:28.738]  Oh, I will Non-X Man.
[01:22:28.858 --> 01:22:31.560]  Well, I'm off to find more ugly toenails.
[01:22:33.701 --> 01:22:36.342]  Don't let Nonox Man find you with unsightly toenails.
[01:22:36.802 --> 01:22:40.283]  Buy diabetic-friendly, money-back-guaranteed Nonox Nail Gel.
[01:22:40.803 --> 01:22:52.028]  It's in the foot care aisle at Super Setters, Walgreens, CVS, Long's, Meijer, Giant Eagle, Car Drug, Snyder's, Duane Reade, Bilo, and Rite Aid.
[01:22:54.109 --> 01:23:00.712]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.084 --> 01:23:05.885]  Okay, I'm going to start shifting into 9-11 after we take some calls.
[01:23:07.125 --> 01:23:10.365]  Just huge news there, and I want to go over what happened in New York.
[01:23:11.526 --> 01:23:14.506]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[01:23:16.907 --> 01:23:19.067]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in New York.
[01:23:19.107 --> 01:23:20.087]  You're on the air, Steve.
[01:23:20.127 --> 01:23:20.727]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:20.767 --> 01:23:21.107]  Welcome.
[01:23:22.168 --> 01:23:23.168]  Hello, Alex.
[01:23:23.368 --> 01:23:23.688]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:24.448 --> 01:23:27.148]  Hey, thank you for being there with us.
[01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:29.749]  We're all together.
[01:23:30.302 --> 01:23:31.924]  At 9-11 Truth, that was great.
[01:23:31.984 --> 01:23:36.508]  I was the guy who told you that InfoWars outranked MSNBC.com.
[01:23:37.008 --> 01:23:38.870]  And it's still on the decline.
[01:23:40.131 --> 01:23:42.394]  And InfoWars is still on the steady decline.
[01:23:44.055 --> 01:23:45.517]  I wanted to... Oh, I'm so hoarse.
[01:23:46.838 --> 01:23:55.066]  I wanted to tell you, while we're in front of the Federal Reserve, one of the scariest things I saw was when the cops, they were in the...
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:24:24.138]  They were in the car, and he looked like he was angry, got out of the car, went into the trunk, and pulled up a whole mess of handcuffs, these wiretie handcuffs, went into the car and started, like, cursing under his breath as he was assembling them, as if, like, he wanted to definitely arrest a few people, and I was like, oh no, this is... I got scared, you know, I got... I can't lie, I got scared a little bit.
[01:24:24.696 --> 01:24:38.864]  Well, for those that don't know, we were marching all over Wall Street and up the Federal Reserve and all over the city there in the southern end of the island or the peninsula of Manhattan.
[01:24:40.565 --> 01:24:40.805]  Yes.
[01:24:41.806 --> 01:24:42.186]  Oh, man.
[01:24:42.346 --> 01:24:47.809]  This cop had a personal vendetta.
[01:24:47.829 --> 01:24:48.550]  He wanted to.
[01:24:49.090 --> 01:24:50.471]  He was just itching.
[01:24:51.351 --> 01:24:53.933]  Most of the cops were really great, and I was talking to a lot of them.
[01:24:54.691 --> 01:24:59.173]  And, uh, you know, some of them were saying, you know, you obviously know more than us.
[01:24:59.193 --> 01:25:00.294]  You know, we don't have time.
[01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:01.814]  We're working 15 hour days a year.
[01:25:01.834 --> 01:25:04.936]  A lot of police say great job and nod their heads and tell us keep it up.
[01:25:05.096 --> 01:25:06.136]  But then you'd have the few.
[01:25:06.196 --> 01:25:10.818]  It was like all the other cops weren't arresting me for being down there at Fox Studios on the sidewalk.
[01:25:11.159 --> 01:25:13.159]  But then the commander comes in and says, arrest him.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.061]  And then they had to admit, well, you shouldn't have been arrested, but didn't didn't matter.
[01:25:17.701 --> 01:25:18.442]  I could beat the rap.
[01:25:18.482 --> 01:25:19.322]  I couldn't beat the ride.
[01:25:21.043 --> 01:25:21.463]  Correct.
[01:25:22.344 --> 01:25:22.784]  Anyway, um,
[01:25:23.972 --> 01:25:24.933]  We had a great time.
[01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.134]  I was yelling at the top of my lungs.
[01:25:27.955 --> 01:25:28.935]  I was exhausted.
[01:25:30.896 --> 01:25:34.218]  The rain was immense, but we still prevailed.
[01:25:34.518 --> 01:25:35.279]  We still prevailed.
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:41.242]  I would like to applaud all the guys that were with me and with you and with us.
[01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:41.923]  Great job.
[01:25:42.663 --> 01:25:43.364]  Thank you very much.
[01:25:43.424 --> 01:25:44.284]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:25:44.304 --> 01:25:45.145]  It was good seeing you there.
[01:25:45.185 --> 01:25:46.005]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:25:46.025 --> 01:25:47.966]  Let's talk to Brian in Philly.
[01:25:47.986 --> 01:25:48.927]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:25:50.593 --> 01:25:52.214]  Hey Alex, it was great to be there with you.
[01:25:52.234 --> 01:25:52.974]  I don't know if you remember me.
[01:25:53.014 --> 01:25:56.717]  I was the tall guy with the shaved head, the American flag bandana.
[01:25:56.737 --> 01:25:57.998]  We talked on camera for a little while.
[01:25:58.058 --> 01:25:58.839]  Yes, I remember you.
[01:25:59.399 --> 01:26:01.621]  Yeah, you know what?
[01:26:01.861 --> 01:26:08.426]  Other than that, I did see a couple of police doing exactly what the last caller said, putting together those makeshift zip tie handcuffs.
[01:26:08.446 --> 01:26:13.469]  But for the most part, I truly felt that the police who were escorting us weren't just escorting us.
[01:26:13.509 --> 01:26:15.471]  I really felt like they were with us that day.
[01:26:16.221 --> 01:26:21.626]  And I know the commanders were so genuine and patting me on the shoulder and saying, what else can we do for you?
[01:26:21.706 --> 01:26:24.508]  And I was like, and I was looking in their eyes and it wasn't an act.
[01:26:24.548 --> 01:26:25.589]  It wasn't like a fake good guy.
[01:26:25.609 --> 01:26:28.212]  I was like, they were being sicky sweet nice.
[01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:41.559]  It was so energizing, because... I mean, I listened to you yesterday... I mean, one of the commanders kept coming over when I'd have my hammock on a railing, and he'd, like, pat on it and rub on it, and tell me, you know, he appreciated how nice we all were.
[01:26:41.579 --> 01:26:43.080]  I was like, oh, this is ridiculous!
[01:26:43.521 --> 01:26:45.102]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[01:26:45.222 --> 01:26:49.785]  Usually, it starts grinding on you, and you get pessimistic day in and day out.
[01:26:49.965 --> 01:26:55.169]  Now, I'm so energized by the fact that I saw that all those first responders and all those police officers
[01:26:55.909 --> 01:26:57.290]  I truly believe they're on our side.
[01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:05.012]  Like, after what I witnessed that day, and what we did that day, there's no doubt in my mind that the resistance is way larger than 51%.
[01:27:05.072 --> 01:27:16.415]  Listen, I was there bullhorning at Ground Zero, and I was looking at, like, half the cops, and I was going, you were here, you knew about the countdown for 7, and they were nodding their heads, and got watery eyes.
[01:27:16.855 --> 01:27:19.896]  I knew they were feeling the chill I was feeling on my spine.
[01:27:24.697 --> 01:27:25.638]  You know, truth does that.
[01:27:43.806 --> 01:27:46.748]  Wow, what a great URL, my friend.
[01:27:47.249 --> 01:27:48.190]  Great meeting you there.
[01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:51.652]  Yeah, I mean, there's so many facets of what Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[01:27:52.093 --> 01:27:53.574]  Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[01:27:54.094 --> 01:27:55.315]  Not Friday, I was there Saturday.
[01:27:55.335 --> 01:27:55.996]  I keep saying Friday.
[01:27:56.416 --> 01:28:04.923]  Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and I left Wednesday, but four days there in New York.
[01:28:05.023 --> 01:28:07.164]  I mean, street actions, demonstrations everywhere.
[01:28:07.765 --> 01:28:12.849]  And it was only at Rock Studios, because we were chanting and taking over the television, even though we were off property.
[01:28:13.684 --> 01:28:20.910]  And, uh, the police were being real nice and that commander pulled up, jumped out of the car, ran up and said, come here with me!
[01:28:20.930 --> 01:28:24.393]  And he took me over and I said, yes sir, what's going on?
[01:28:24.413 --> 01:28:27.536]  And he said, hands behind your back, you're going to jail.
[01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:30.518]  And it completely blew up in his face.
[01:28:31.499 --> 01:28:38.865]  And, uh, when I walked out of the precinct in the booking room, he was being griped at in the corner.
[01:28:43.749 --> 01:28:46.753]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.694 --> 01:28:50.357]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:57.913]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:28:58.154 --> 01:29:02.997]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:03.017 --> 01:29:04.598]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:04.759 --> 01:29:08.161]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:29:53.670 --> 01:29:55.512]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:29:55.652 --> 01:30:00.837]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:30:00.997 --> 01:30:02.338]  But the symptoms are there.
[01:30:02.619 --> 01:30:10.786]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:30:11.006 --> 01:30:16.752]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:18.674]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:30:18.754 --> 01:30:20.896]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:30:20.916 --> 01:30:25.281]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:30:25.461 --> 01:30:27.603]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:30:27.684 --> 01:30:35.572]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:30:36.564 --> 01:30:37.144]  We're good.
[01:30:53.055 --> 01:30:57.619]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:30:58.039 --> 01:31:00.961]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:31:01.281 --> 01:31:03.863]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:31:04.224 --> 01:31:09.047]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:31:09.427 --> 01:31:14.791]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:31:15.092 --> 01:31:18.054]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:31:18.234 --> 01:31:18.794]  We're good to go.
[01:31:41.702 --> 01:31:44.143]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:31:44.163 --> 01:31:45.904]  There was something so terrible about that place.
[01:31:46.024 --> 01:31:48.325]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[01:32:11.121 --> 01:32:25.322]  And when you're out there, without care, yeah I was out of touch But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much
[01:32:40.417 --> 01:32:41.097]  Possibly.
[01:32:43.618 --> 01:32:46.820]  My heroes have always lived their lives out on a limb.
[01:33:12.535 --> 01:33:14.319]  Oh, oh, oh.
[01:33:31.791 --> 01:33:32.652]  Just like me!
[01:33:32.672 --> 01:33:37.357]  Just like me!
[01:33:39.178 --> 01:33:53.011]  My love has a heart to the lines I wanna lend And all I remember is thinking I wanna be like them
[01:34:04.467 --> 01:34:05.448]  My heroes!
[01:34:48.527 --> 01:34:52.089]  My heroes have always lived their lives out on a limb.
[01:34:52.109 --> 01:34:54.970]  And when I grew up, I wanted to be like them.
[01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:58.992]  We're going to go to more of your calls and get into all this 9-11 news here in just a few minutes.

[01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:49.108]  And it's great after you read it to give to others to wake them up or leave them in the dental office or the hair salon or at work.

[01:36:33.204 --> 01:36:36.604]  Terror Storm Special Edition, the final cut, is now out.
[01:36:37.045 --> 01:36:39.225]  17 minutes of added information on the BBC reported.
[01:36:39.890 --> 01:36:45.152]  That building 7 fell in its own footprint from fire, 25 minutes before anything collapsed.
[01:36:46.113 --> 01:36:51.155]  That's just about 3 or 4 minutes of the added 17 minutes in this history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:36:51.495 --> 01:36:55.216]  An absolute must-see, available at InfoWars.com, a hard copy on DVD.

[01:37:38.365 --> 01:37:42.626]  Some of these things we even lose money on, frankly, like the citizen rule books we put for free in every order.

[01:38:38.524 --> 01:38:38.905]  Go ahead.
[01:38:38.925 --> 01:38:40.986]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[01:38:41.066 --> 01:38:42.227]  It's a pleasure being on your show.
[01:38:42.247 --> 01:38:43.448]  I hope you can hear me okay.
[01:38:43.608 --> 01:38:44.469]  I hear you loud and clear.
[01:38:44.509 --> 01:38:44.769]  Welcome.
[01:38:45.757 --> 01:38:46.157]  Excellent.
[01:38:46.817 --> 01:38:55.381]  Okay, your first caller also mentioned what I wanted to ask you, actually, which is concerning the stand-down order that is going to take place tomorrow.
[01:38:55.401 --> 01:39:04.844]  Yes, we've written an article for InfoWars.net, and Steve Watson's done the analysis, and I concur with his analysis.
[01:39:04.884 --> 01:39:07.906]  You go ahead and just say whatever you want.
[01:39:09.645 --> 01:39:10.225]  Yeah, okay.
[01:39:10.305 --> 01:39:21.252]  I have an article, two articles actually in front of me right here, that says on the 5th of September there was a B-52 bomber flying from one point of the United States to the other.
[01:39:21.433 --> 01:39:29.057]  Flew to Minot and back down in Minot's, the disposal center, and they left the... I mean, there's nukes on planes all the time in the air.
[01:39:30.178 --> 01:39:30.478]  Oh, really?
[01:39:30.718 --> 01:39:34.721]  Because they say like... No, no, there's news articles saying there's never nukes in the air, and that's not true.
[01:39:35.973 --> 01:39:41.277]  Yeah, but they said the pilots didn't have any idea they were carrying nukes from point A to B and stuff like this.
[01:39:42.038 --> 01:39:47.022]  Yes, that's because they were supposed to offload the nukes at the decommissioned center at Minot.
[01:39:47.663 --> 01:39:48.984]  I ought to get Weldon Henson in here.
[01:39:49.024 --> 01:39:52.727]  He was in the Air Force for, what, five years and serviced the bombers.
[01:39:53.427 --> 01:39:59.653]  And he read all the articles a few weeks ago when that came out and just said that it was a screw-up and that he'd seen things like that before.
[01:39:59.673 --> 01:40:01.774]  It's amazing.
[01:40:01.834 --> 01:40:04.897]  I thought I was going to surprise you with this article, but you have it all
[01:40:06.821 --> 01:40:07.902]  No, I don't have it all figured out.
[01:40:07.942 --> 01:40:09.644]  It could be something, but I don't think it is.
[01:40:10.185 --> 01:40:11.706]  And now we're hearing about a stand down.
[01:40:12.367 --> 01:40:21.456]  They always have a day of safety where they stand down and go back through safety, look at everything on the planes, because that's what causes, well, number one, it's pilot error.
[01:40:21.496 --> 01:40:23.538]  Secondarily, it's equipment malfunction.
[01:40:27.758 --> 01:40:28.859]  That would be it.
[01:40:28.999 --> 01:40:33.783]  I just wanted to say I have a small group called InfoWarriors here in Germany.
[01:40:35.004 --> 01:40:37.547]  A small group, but fastly growing.
[01:40:37.567 --> 01:40:48.676]  And your TerrorStorm movie is synchronized in German, so everybody here in Germany can enjoy your work of art as well.
[01:40:48.956 --> 01:40:53.080]  You can type TerrorStorm in German after it and it pops up on Google, right?
[01:40:53.996 --> 01:40:57.217]  Yes, somebody actually synchronized it in German.
[01:40:57.597 --> 01:41:02.779]  Can you say the Info-War will prevail against the forces of the New World Order in German?
[01:41:08.700 --> 01:41:09.901]  Say that again, one more time.
[01:41:09.941 --> 01:41:12.662]  Just say the Info-War will prevail against the forces of the New World Order.
[01:41:12.682 --> 01:41:13.922]  I love it!
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.401]  A lot of folks waking up over in Germany.
[01:41:22.441 --> 01:41:25.042]  We get hundreds of thousands of visitors a month from Germany alone.
[01:41:25.362 --> 01:41:28.284]  And it's thanks to people like you out there, my friend Juan.
[01:41:28.464 --> 01:41:30.225]  I salute you and I appreciate your fine work.
[01:41:32.005 --> 01:41:32.446]  I'll go ahead?
[01:41:33.346 --> 01:41:33.546]  Yes.
[01:41:34.026 --> 01:41:34.607]  I'm done.
[01:41:34.747 --> 01:41:36.207]  Alright, thank you sir.
[01:41:37.768 --> 01:41:39.769]  Good to hear from you there in Germany.
[01:41:39.969 --> 01:41:41.690]  Alright, let me get into this right now.
[01:41:42.030 --> 01:41:43.191]  Here's the quote you're about to hear.
[01:41:43.211 --> 01:41:45.292]  Let's play the clip from singing in with the cops.
[01:41:46.892 --> 01:41:50.756]  In front of Building 7, 200 yards in front, saying, get back, get back, get back.
[01:41:50.796 --> 01:41:52.157]  The building is about to come down.
[01:41:52.538 --> 01:41:53.379]  They're going to bring it down.
[01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:53.839]  Here's the quote.
[01:41:54.079 --> 01:41:55.020]  Keep an eye on that building.
[01:41:55.060 --> 01:41:56.161]  It'll be coming down soon.
[01:41:56.422 --> 01:41:57.663]  The whole thing is about to blow up.
[01:41:57.703 --> 01:41:59.064]  That building is about to blow up.
[01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:00.125]  Okay?
[01:42:00.646 --> 01:42:02.147]  Now that is what you're about to hear.
[01:42:02.167 --> 01:42:05.911]  You can watch the video in the story of Paul Watson's death on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:42:05.951 --> 01:42:06.692]  That's old news.
[01:42:06.952 --> 01:42:10.175]  I'm going to walk through this first with the new news to have it in context.
[01:42:10.215 --> 01:42:10.556]  Here it is.
[01:42:11.348 --> 01:42:20.530]  Keep your eye on that building.
[01:42:20.670 --> 01:42:22.011]  It'll be coming down.
[01:42:22.111 --> 01:42:23.231]  Alright guys.
[01:42:23.311 --> 01:42:28.752]  We are walking back to the building.
[01:42:38.323 --> 01:42:47.327]  Just in the last few seconds, another building, building number 7, one of the buildings in support of the World Trade Center Towers has collapsed.
[01:42:49.328 --> 01:42:49.668]  All right.
[01:42:50.968 --> 01:42:52.249]  Keep an eye on that building.
[01:42:52.309 --> 01:42:53.449]  It'll be coming down soon.
[01:42:53.489 --> 01:42:54.870]  That whole thing is about to blow up.
[01:42:54.890 --> 01:42:56.150]  That building is about to blow up.
[01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:56.851]  Now, that's CNN.
[01:42:56.931 --> 01:43:00.032]  And that was live that day.
[01:43:00.072 --> 01:43:01.993]  They re-aired that on the second anniversary.
[01:43:02.033 --> 01:43:07.255]  They aired just the whole day over again, as I saw MSNBC doing in my hotel room when I got home at about 2 in the morning.
[01:43:08.169 --> 01:43:12.933]  About one in the morning, I guess on September 12th by then, but from September 11th.
[01:43:14.194 --> 01:43:18.737]  Now it's two police officers and they're waving everybody back, saying it's about to come down.
[01:43:21.519 --> 01:43:27.524]  I've talked to a bunch of firefighters, police, emergency workers, EMTs who all said and saw the same thing.
[01:43:27.544 --> 01:43:30.706]  There's other videos of police saying get back, it's about to come down.
[01:43:30.746 --> 01:43:32.047]  It was on NPR locally.
[01:43:34.275 --> 01:43:38.378]  9-1-1 First Responders, Her WTC7 Demolition Countdown.
[01:43:39.278 --> 01:43:43.061]  This is the new article from Hall Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:43:43.121 --> 01:43:47.163]  Dig it, get it out to everybody, email it, post it on your MySpace.
[01:43:47.203 --> 01:43:48.184]  Help us get it out, please.
[01:43:48.584 --> 01:43:50.445]  Print it off in the office, hand it out, get it out!
[01:43:50.465 --> 01:43:55.489]  9-1-1 First Responder, Her WTC7 Demolition Countdown.
[01:43:56.569 --> 01:44:00.392]  Former Air Force Special Operations, Research and Rescue Expert, Witnessed Officials,
[01:44:01.164 --> 01:44:01.644]  We're good to go.
[01:44:27.009 --> 01:44:45.660]  ...named Mike, who told Loose Change producer Dylan Avery that hundreds of emergency rescue personnel were told over bullhorns that Building 7, a 47-story skyscraper adjacent to the Twin Towers, was not hit by a plane that imploded symmetrically later in the afternoon on 9-11, was about to be pulled, and that a 20-second radio countdown preceded its collapse.
[01:44:46.301 --> 01:44:56.307]  That account was backed up by another Ground Zero rescue worker who went on record, we've had her here and played clips here, with her full name, Volunteer EMT Indra
[01:44:57.762 --> 01:45:07.448]  C. described to a radio show how she learned that WTC7 was going to be brought down and the context was clear that it was to be deliberately demolished.
[01:45:07.928 --> 01:45:21.416]  In addition, former New York PD officer Craig Bartmer described hearing bombs, I've met him personally, interviewed him, never been seen because I did the interview and put it in the 9-11 film I'm going to make yet, to tear down the building as he fled the collapse.
[01:45:22.424 --> 01:45:32.347]  Now another Ground Zero first responder has shed more light on how he heard the countdown moments before attempting to escape the collapse of Building 7 as a stampede ensued.
[01:45:32.367 --> 01:45:33.407]  And there's a bunch of other people.
[01:45:33.467 --> 01:45:34.608]  It goes through enlistment.
[01:45:37.008 --> 01:45:49.072]  Now imagine if we went before a grand jury and had these firefighters and police and EMTs and medical workers all saying this and then we had video, which we do, of a policeman saying, get back, it's about to come down.
[01:45:49.699 --> 01:45:55.984]  And then we have other emergency workers saying, and then we have Larry Silverstein saying, we gave the order to pull it, and gave the order to watch it come down.
[01:45:57.525 --> 01:45:59.647]  I mean, this is an open and shut case!
[01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:10.056]  And I was there with ground zero cops, talking about this, and I mean, I was looking at them, most of them were nodding, and looking at me going, mm-hmm, yeah.
[01:46:10.576 --> 01:46:12.297]  And you could see tears in their eyes.
[01:46:13.498 --> 01:46:15.960]  Imagine working every day, knowing the government blew it up!
[01:46:16.601 --> 01:46:17.642]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:46:18.302 --> 01:46:19.203]  It's incredible!
[01:46:21.408 --> 01:46:26.650]  Let me tell you, the hole in the dam is getting bigger and bigger and more and more water is pouring in and there's cracks forming everywhere.
[01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:27.930]  It's going to burst.
[01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:29.851]  That's why they want to attack Iran.
[01:46:29.871 --> 01:46:31.252]  That's why they want to escalate martial law.
[01:46:31.272 --> 01:46:33.372]  That's why they want to get something going on with the Browns.
[01:46:34.033 --> 01:46:34.573]  Before then...
[01:46:38.681 --> 01:46:49.704]  Former Air Force Special Operations Research and Rescue expert Kevin McPadden traveled to Ground Zero completely of his own accord and spent the next four days searching through the rubble and nearby buildings for survivors.
[01:46:49.744 --> 01:46:59.406]  In a speech given at this week's 9-11 Truth Events in New York City, McPadden describes the shocking details of what he witnessed shortly before the WTC7 implosion into his own footprint.
[01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:04.067]  Now I've known about McPadden and been so busy and there were so many other witnesses I've never even interviewed him.
[01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:11.834]  But I was going to give my speech, and I thought, why not, I've been talking to Kevin McPadden off to the side, why not get him up here and to talk about it?
[01:47:12.995 --> 01:47:16.958]  Then I went for an hour to my hotel room, and I interviewed him there right after, and he told it in more detail.
[01:47:16.978 --> 01:47:24.022]  Because you notice he talks about how he could tell it was a countdown, and they were all acting upset, and the firemen were upset, and then he took his hand off, and then he said, run for your lives.
[01:47:24.062 --> 01:47:29.586]  What he didn't add there, but he did on video with us later, was that he, it, was they heard the three, two,
[01:47:30.464 --> 01:47:40.270]  And they could tell it was already a countdown, it was right by him, you could hear the pulse, you know, the mer-mer-mer-mer, you know, the countdown, and everybody started running, and others reported that they were on down the road, saying it openly.
[01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:42.371]  And then you do see, we have the video of the cops saying it.
[01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:48.014]  Say, I mean, we have this in triplicate, quadruplicate, on top of triplicate, on top of quadruplicate.
[01:47:52.757 --> 01:47:59.601]  They were busy pushing them back and forth, a couple of vets that were there, they got the vibe that something was coming down, said McPadden.
[01:48:00.416 --> 01:48:02.197]  This is a quote from the video you're about to hear.
[01:48:03.018 --> 01:48:04.199]  We started asking questions.
[01:48:04.239 --> 01:48:05.500]  Everybody started asking questions.
[01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:11.304]  The next thing you know, there was a Red Cross representative pacing back and forth in front of the crowd, holding his hand over the radio.
[01:48:11.845 --> 01:48:15.047]  I couldn't hear what it was saying, but it was, like, pulsed.
[01:48:15.607 --> 01:48:18.670]  Whatever the speech was on, there was a pulse.
[01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:22.693]  And that means to me, most likely, it was a countdown.
[01:48:22.713 --> 01:48:23.573]  But then he goes on.
[01:48:24.734 --> 01:48:25.595]  This is in front of a crowd.
[01:48:25.615 --> 01:48:28.537]  To say that when they did take the hand off, they heard the countdown.
[01:48:29.218 --> 01:48:41.264]  But he took his hand off, this is a quote, at the last three seconds, and he gave this heartfelt look, like just, run for your life, because he didn't want to bring it on his conscience.
[01:48:41.864 --> 01:48:48.348]  He didn't want to go to his grave with that, and then we had a couple of seconds to get our heads together, said McPadden.
[01:48:48.388 --> 01:48:50.589]  And to be clear, this isn't in front of a crowd, a transcript of that.
[01:48:50.829 --> 01:48:54.531]  When we put the video out of the full interview, when he's calm going over it, he screamed, run for your lives.
[01:48:54.551 --> 01:48:56.752]  He looked real sad, and then he screamed, run for your lives.
[01:48:57.634 --> 01:49:01.977]  McPadden then describes the frantic attempts to escape as the building began to collapse.
[01:49:05.839 --> 01:49:13.745]  In the taped interview with us after the event, McPadden made it clear that he and onlookers clearly heard the 3-2-1 from the radio before the building collapsed.
[01:49:13.765 --> 01:49:16.506]  He said it was about three seconds after that that they heard BOOM!
[01:49:16.586 --> 01:49:16.967]  BOOM!
[01:49:17.027 --> 01:49:17.327]  BOOM!
[01:49:17.367 --> 01:49:18.548]  and then the shaking ground.
[01:49:22.856 --> 01:49:24.657]  We'll be releasing that tape over the next week.
[01:49:24.697 --> 01:49:26.858]  We also talked to other first responders.
[01:49:26.878 --> 01:49:27.999]  We just got off planes last night.
[01:49:28.019 --> 01:49:30.000]  We got to dump it in the computer, put it on the web, upload it.
[01:49:30.500 --> 01:49:32.602]  We also talked to other first responders who verified the story.
[01:49:32.982 --> 01:49:45.569]  McPatton's account, when added with the testimony of other first responders, clearly shows that officials knew the building was about to be brought down and a planned demolition and that they made a conscious effort or were ordered to hide the fact from the first responders.
[01:49:45.989 --> 01:49:51.893]  Though at the very end, onlookers were given a brief warning which enabled them to escape to safety.
[01:49:56.647 --> 01:50:02.093]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:02.473 --> 01:50:10.122]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:10.791 --> 01:50:17.854]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.254 --> 01:50:29.679]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.979 --> 01:50:33.501]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:33.941 --> 01:50:35.882]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.202 --> 01:50:40.064]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:11.421]  We haven't had time to get it off our tapes and put it up.
[01:53:12.970 --> 01:53:15.053]  I'm told that Elaine Brown just called in.
[01:53:15.093 --> 01:53:19.500]  I want to give her plenty of time to talk about what's going on, the rest of these four men.
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:24.683]  Uh, so I'd ask her to just hold there for just a moment because I've got Weldon Henson in here.
[01:53:24.703 --> 01:53:27.265]  Weldon, just in two minutes, you were in the Air Force, what, five years?
[01:53:27.705 --> 01:53:28.246]  Six years.
[01:53:28.366 --> 01:53:28.746]  Six years?
[01:53:28.826 --> 01:53:29.187]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:29.207 --> 01:53:30.327]  I didn't have your mic up yet.
[01:53:31.028 --> 01:53:34.590]  Uh, and I, from my memory, I remember the Air Force every year stands down for a safety day.
[01:53:35.131 --> 01:53:42.076]  And some people have kind of mixed this info in with that and are saying it means there's going to be an attack on Friday because there's going to be a stand down tomorrow.
[01:53:42.096 --> 01:53:43.657]  Can you explain to people that that standard?
[01:53:44.762 --> 01:53:46.104]  Let's clear some things up.
[01:53:46.664 --> 01:53:52.269]  You have standard down days, what they call them, safety days, no matter what, a certain amount per year.
[01:53:53.330 --> 01:53:58.395]  I could clearly see maybe this one being one because of the incident with the weapons on the V-52.
[01:53:58.475 --> 01:54:01.498]  Well, that's why they do safety deals every year when they shut down.
[01:54:01.658 --> 01:54:02.419]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:02.439 --> 01:54:03.359]  It happens all the time.
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:10.346]  And this could be one that, yes, and even whenever there's a mishap, a major mishap, such as what happened last month,
[01:54:11.068 --> 01:54:12.569]  Um, they'll shut down, yeah.
[01:54:12.609 --> 01:54:13.769]  That's standard procedure.
[01:54:13.789 --> 01:54:15.710]  They'll shut down on, and Friday is when they do it.
[01:54:15.730 --> 01:54:17.530]  Now, you've been around nukes and B-52s.
[01:54:17.570 --> 01:54:19.011]  Explain what Minot does.
[01:54:19.851 --> 01:54:29.034]  Uh, Minot is just, uh, one of the wings, B-52 bomber wings, and it's a place where usually they, you know, they hold a lot of the nuclear weapons up there, so.
[01:54:29.474 --> 01:54:30.314]  That's where it was going.
[01:54:30.354 --> 01:54:32.175]  That's also disposal, isn't it?
[01:54:32.255 --> 01:54:33.495]  Right in that area, yeah.
[01:54:33.595 --> 01:54:35.536]  I've never been to Minot myself, but, uh,
[01:54:36.539 --> 01:54:37.999]  But yeah, I mean, everybody knows that.
[01:54:38.059 --> 01:54:41.441]  How could you see nukes being put on a plane and then forgotten to be taken off?
[01:54:41.681 --> 01:54:42.401]  Different aircrew?
[01:54:43.481 --> 01:54:56.945]  Um... I could never see them being loaded accidentally, but I could see it maybe happening when they come in and, you know, they file reports when they come in, they have all their post-flight stuff, maybe some pages got mixed up or something.
[01:54:57.565 --> 01:55:01.186]  I've never heard of it happening, but it's amazing some of the things that happen.
[01:55:01.847 --> 01:55:04.788]  You'd be surprised, you know, with the wrong things happening.
[01:55:04.848 --> 01:55:06.088]  I mean, it just happens all the time.
[01:55:06.818 --> 01:55:13.264]  But my memory was correct that every year, because I hear about it every year, they have safety stand downs in the Army, the Navy, the Marines.
[01:55:13.284 --> 01:55:14.125]  We have them all the time.
[01:55:15.026 --> 01:55:27.237]  And even when something happens like a mishap, as if like this, I could clearly see this being a down day for everyone to go through, you know, inventory training or something, mishap training for nuclear, you know, security or something.
[01:55:28.297 --> 01:55:29.397]  You have your standard days.
[01:55:29.577 --> 01:55:39.780]  I mean, they have so many days a year where they have standard training days, safety days, and then anytime an incident happens, like say someone on the flight line falls off a ladder, well then guess what?
[01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:47.082]  That whole wing is going down on that maybe a Friday somewhere in the future for a complete, you know, aircraft ladder training day, safety day.
[01:55:47.102 --> 01:55:48.802]  I mean, it's totally normal.
[01:55:50.299 --> 01:55:53.881]  That's just like when this office turns into a pigsty, we'll have a whole day of cleaning it.
[01:55:55.862 --> 01:55:56.702]  Oh yeah, sometimes.
[01:55:57.022 --> 01:55:58.843]  Hey, Weldon, thanks for coming in and talking to us.
[01:55:58.863 --> 01:56:00.324]  I'm glad we could clear some things up.
[01:56:00.364 --> 01:56:00.884]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:56:00.964 --> 01:56:03.865]  Thank you, yeah, because we try to be credible here and actually cover real issues.
[01:56:05.886 --> 01:56:12.889]  Oh boy, I guess, um, see I had Weldon already sitting here right when I went on air and then heard that Elaine was there and I wanted to finish with Weldon and we lost her connection.
[01:56:12.909 --> 01:56:13.930]  Are you able to call her back?
[01:56:16.388 --> 01:56:17.169]  Did you get her number?
[01:56:17.209 --> 01:56:19.111]  Because we've been trying it and we're about to go to her.
[01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:26.699]  Well, we'll see what happens with that and see what she has to say about the latest developments that are going on there.
[01:56:26.859 --> 01:56:28.501]  Did you get the new number when she called in?
[01:56:29.522 --> 01:56:30.323]  Okay, just call that.
[01:56:32.884 --> 01:56:35.027]  We'll see where we'll get Elaine Brown on with an update.
[01:56:35.087 --> 01:56:36.929]  For those that don't know, four people were arrested.
[01:56:37.169 --> 01:56:40.193]  We have a big new development here that we just discovered right during the last break.
[01:56:40.213 --> 01:56:41.295]  That's why things are so crazy.
[01:56:41.635 --> 01:56:44.359]  Why I wasn't back in the studio to hear that Elaine was there until I got on air.
[01:56:45.019 --> 01:56:46.822]  I was out in the hall talking to Matt Kazee.
[01:56:48.183 --> 01:56:52.304]  That is out in the hall on the phone, talking to Matt Kazee of 9-11 Truth up in Virginia, who was at 9-11.
[01:56:52.344 --> 01:56:53.244]  I saw him.
[01:56:53.904 --> 01:56:56.245]  And Mr. Riley, who got arrested, was also up there.
[01:56:56.285 --> 01:56:57.305]  I saw him and shook his hand.
[01:56:57.345 --> 01:57:00.606]  Danny Riley, who got tasered by the police before and grabbed and shot at.
[01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:07.087]  And he said that... And I'd heard they got grabbed in New York, quote, ducking in from the rain.
[01:57:07.127 --> 01:57:11.308]  That was the only piece of info I got from somebody who was detained with Danny Riley.
[01:57:11.348 --> 01:57:15.809]  Now we've confirmed that the cops followed after Danny Riley
[01:57:16.810 --> 01:57:19.612]  and others and said we're going to take him down once he leaves the crowd.
[01:57:19.632 --> 01:57:20.953]  I wish people would have told me that then.
[01:57:21.674 --> 01:57:27.378]  So it's all craziness here as we continue to report from all the different angles and different developments of what's going on.
[01:57:28.078 --> 01:57:28.899]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:57:28.919 --> 01:57:30.840]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:33.402 --> 01:57:38.066]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.864 --> 01:57:50.505]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.165 --> 01:57:52.226]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.926 --> 01:57:54.027]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.708 --> 01:57:55.508]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.269 --> 01:57:58.170]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.190 --> 01:58:01.493]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.033 --> 01:58:06.136]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.336 --> 01:58:10.800]  Alright, we're now into hour number two.
[01:58:10.840 --> 01:58:14.722]  I'm going to continue after we talk to Elaine Brown and Matt Kazee.
[01:58:16.564 --> 01:58:18.145]  You said I had Matt Kazee on the line, correct?
[01:58:19.125 --> 01:58:20.346]  Okay, good.
[01:58:20.366 --> 01:58:23.288]  9-11 first responder, WTC7 demolition countdown.
[01:58:23.528 --> 01:58:24.829]  This adds to all the other evidence.
[01:58:24.849 --> 01:58:28.492]  We're going to play that audio of him speaking out about it from the video coming up.
[01:58:29.533 --> 01:58:34.797]  But for those that just joined us, four associates of Ed and Elaine Brown arrested.
[01:58:34.817 --> 01:58:35.838]  AP headline.
[01:58:37.159 --> 01:58:39.360]  And we're going to go back through some of this right now.
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:44.144]  Elaine, thank you for calling into the show when we requested it because your numbers are always changing.
[01:58:44.164 --> 01:58:45.405]  We're unable to get a hold of you.
[01:58:46.305 --> 01:58:48.407]  Can you tell us exactly what you know about what's happened?
[01:58:50.021 --> 01:58:56.465]  We were told, late yesterday afternoon, we found out that four of our friends had been arrested by the Federal Marshals.
[01:58:57.406 --> 01:59:00.948]  One in Texas, one in Missouri, one in New York, one in Vermont.
[01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:11.616]  Danny Riley, you know, the one who was shot at by the Federal Marshals in Taser back in June, was arrested in New York.
[01:59:13.135 --> 01:59:18.419]  And from what I understand, the charges on him are all total fabrications.
[01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:22.482]  One is accessory after the fact.
[01:59:22.602 --> 01:59:37.274]  There is impeding or doing harm to a federal officer, offenses against the United States, and possession of a weapon relating to a violent crime.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:40.060]  But no violent crime has been committed.
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:40.660]  I saw that.
[01:59:40.880 --> 01:59:41.581]  How can they do that?
[01:59:42.141 --> 01:59:42.641]  Exactly.
[01:59:42.681 --> 01:59:47.102]  The only violence has been when the marshal shot at and tasered Danny Riley.
[01:59:47.142 --> 01:59:49.642]  That's the only violence that's happened at all.
[01:59:49.662 --> 01:59:53.843]  So, I mean, this is all probably bogus charges.
[01:59:53.863 --> 02:00:01.584]  They're just meant to intimidate and harass and keep people fearful from sticking firm and doing what's right.
[02:00:01.724 --> 02:00:05.425]  How did you ascertain that these are the charges on Riley?
[02:00:07.180 --> 02:00:10.741]  Sean Krenop just called and told me.
[02:00:11.521 --> 02:00:16.483]  He phoned the clerk of court in New York, in Albany.
[02:00:17.123 --> 02:00:23.605]  Now apparently Danny and Bob are scheduled to appear in federal court here in Concord today.
[02:00:23.625 --> 02:00:27.986]  So Danny is being transported from New York down to New Hampshire.
[02:00:29.497 --> 02:00:32.118]  What about Reno from Texas?
[02:00:32.878 --> 02:00:34.499]  I don't know anything about Reno.
[02:00:34.519 --> 02:00:44.062]  Jason was arrested in Missouri, which means he was arrested right out of... We just lost Elaine again.
[02:00:44.082 --> 02:00:45.843]  Go ahead and get her back on.
[02:00:46.283 --> 02:00:47.383]  Now, here's Mackenzie.
[02:00:47.403 --> 02:00:51.565]  I wish somebody... I'm not griping, but I wish somebody would have told me this when I was in New York.
[02:00:51.845 --> 02:00:52.385]  I saw
[02:00:53.132 --> 02:00:58.156]  Danny Riley shook his hand once, talked to him again in the days we were there, saw him on 9-11.
[02:00:58.476 --> 02:01:00.078]  In fact, I saw him twice that day.
[02:01:00.718 --> 02:01:20.394]  Then it started raining, we all got broken up, and supposedly he was walking off away from the crowd with a cinematographer who's from Austin, who was just covering the event, and of course that is, even a fellow you'll see in the credits of Endgame, he's done some great video work for us here in Austin, and he
[02:01:21.977 --> 02:01:25.979]  Got detained with him, but he wouldn't talk much on the phone to Aaron Dykes last night or this morning.
[02:01:25.999 --> 02:01:26.859]  He's pretty freaked out.
[02:01:26.880 --> 02:01:30.041]  I don't even like to even say his name on air, but it's all over the news.
[02:01:30.121 --> 02:01:45.849]  I'll try to give him some privacy, but it's Terry Melton, and he said that they ducked in out of the rain and that the police came up and pulled guns on him and had him get down, and then he was taken in and brutally interrogated and screamed at, told he was going to go to prison and he didn't do this and that.
[02:01:46.873 --> 02:02:00.161]  And by the end of it, the Feds will try to turn some of these people to claim that the Browns have Godzilla under their house, and flying saucers, and ray guns, and we're planning to take over Mars.
[02:02:00.221 --> 02:02:04.823]  I mean, it's just unbelievable propaganda.
[02:02:07.045 --> 02:02:10.066]  And I'm just trying to stop any type of escalation.
[02:02:10.087 --> 02:02:10.787]  Do we have Mackenzie?
[02:02:13.121 --> 02:02:14.363]  Matt, we're about to break.
[02:02:14.383 --> 02:02:15.064]  Just stay there.
[02:02:15.084 --> 02:02:17.748]  When we come back, I want to find out exactly what you saw.
[02:02:18.409 --> 02:02:21.253]  We just talked to you for 30 seconds back during a break.
[02:02:22.009 --> 02:02:25.773]  Paul Bedlam breaks loose around here as news continues to develop.
[02:02:26.234 --> 02:02:27.655]  I want to continue with your phone calls.
[02:02:27.715 --> 02:02:28.316]  Get into Building 7.
[02:02:28.376 --> 02:02:29.557]  Huge bombshell news.
[02:02:29.577 --> 02:02:34.462]  Spend some time today recapping the incredible things that happened in New York for the 6th anniversary.
[02:02:35.043 --> 02:02:36.404]  You were looking for the Info War.
[02:02:36.464 --> 02:02:38.867]  You were looking for the front lines in the fight for liberty and freedom.
[02:02:39.407 --> 02:02:41.069]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have found it.
[02:02:41.490 --> 02:02:42.451]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:42.871 --> 02:02:44.473]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:02:45.555 --> 02:02:46.296]  Terrorism!
[02:02:46.456 --> 02:02:47.216]  Terrorism!
[02:02:47.316 --> 02:02:53.400]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[02:02:53.640 --> 02:02:55.241]  Alarming words for our time!
[02:02:55.481 --> 02:02:57.963]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:02:58.343 --> 02:03:12.912]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:12.952 --> 02:03:13.292]  government.
[02:03:13.452 --> 02:03:15.233]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:03:15.613 --> 02:03:21.536]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:21.656 --> 02:03:26.158]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[02:03:26.418 --> 02:03:33.140]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:34.641]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at
[02:03:48.024 --> 02:03:51.206]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:03:51.547 --> 02:03:53.488]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[02:03:53.848 --> 02:04:01.534]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.194 --> 02:04:09.259]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:09.639 --> 02:04:16.544]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying,
[02:04:17.020 --> 02:04:21.081]  Secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:21.361 --> 02:04:24.842]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:25.342 --> 02:04:27.263]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:27.603 --> 02:04:31.524]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:04:44.671 --> 02:04:52.157]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry, and I'm a plastic surgeon, and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[02:04:52.317 --> 02:04:54.819]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[02:04:54.859 --> 02:05:01.024]  It's called Night Skin, and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels, and without a facelift.
[02:05:01.264 --> 02:05:04.407]  In 12 hours, it will make your skin seem smoother.

[02:05:56.655 --> 02:05:57.515]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.535 --> 02:06:01.916]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.396 --> 02:06:06.517]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.077 --> 02:06:16.699]  Alright, Matt, real fast, tell what you saw on 9-11 there at Ground Zero during the demonstrations with the 9-11 truthers.
[02:06:18.274 --> 02:06:26.637]  Because I got Elaine Brown on hold, and I want to get her story, but this may help her with a piece of it right now, before her phone cuts out again.
[02:06:26.697 --> 02:06:28.798]  What did you witness happen to Danny Riley?
[02:06:29.278 --> 02:06:39.182]  Sure, I was working with Terry Melton as a cinematographer on the 11th, and we went to go grab some lunch, Terry Melton and Danny Riley and I, and we walked about a block.
[02:06:39.202 --> 02:06:46.445]  I had my friend, Paul, who was with me, and he came up and told me that while
[02:06:47.369 --> 02:06:50.550]  There was a big crowd of people around you, and actually, Danny was talking to you.
[02:06:51.070 --> 02:06:54.570]  He heard some of the police talking about how they really wanted to arrest somebody.
[02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:59.571]  One of the guys said, well, hold on, when he gets away from the crowd, we'll take him down.
[02:07:00.191 --> 02:07:07.393]  Now, we came, and we told a few people, we told Aaron, this was right about the same time that the cops were pushing the camera back in Aaron's face.
[02:07:08.173 --> 02:07:12.614]  And, I mean, it's hard to get up close to you, Alex, with all those... No, I'm not blaming anybody.
[02:07:12.654 --> 02:07:14.674]  I just don't know how I didn't get told about it, but go ahead.
[02:07:15.628 --> 02:07:17.408]  And so, we went off to lunch.
[02:07:17.528 --> 02:07:27.090]  As we're going off to lunch, my friend is staying there at Ground Zero, and he noticed that the cops are getting on the cell phones, and something's going on.
[02:07:27.130 --> 02:07:27.991]  So he followed them.
[02:07:28.111 --> 02:07:29.531]  Now, he didn't know I was going to lunch.
[02:07:29.591 --> 02:07:30.351]  We went off to eat.
[02:07:30.671 --> 02:07:33.092]  Terry Melton tells me that people are following us.
[02:07:33.712 --> 02:07:40.873]  So I go out ahead of them when we're leaving the diner and across the street, and I notice two cops clocking me.
[02:07:41.313 --> 02:07:44.374]  It was one in blue and one in a white shirt with a blue hat.
[02:07:45.129 --> 02:07:46.451]  I don't think so.
[02:08:03.639 --> 02:08:04.179]  I confirmed.
[02:08:04.199 --> 02:08:05.480]  We watched the video last night.
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:07.440]  We do have these guys on tape.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:16.783]  We do have the guy who was absolutely saying... So did they grab Terry Melton and Danny Reilly that day, right after that?
[02:08:17.283 --> 02:08:17.563]  Yes.
[02:08:17.743 --> 02:08:24.165]  As far as I... The first thing I heard was that they went back home to Danny's place and they got him there.
[02:08:24.225 --> 02:08:25.865]  But now they may have gotten him before.
[02:08:25.945 --> 02:08:27.145]  It was in Coho's, New York.
[02:08:27.225 --> 02:08:28.546]  I'm not sure exactly where that is.
[02:08:28.846 --> 02:08:32.627]  Because the word we got is talking to Melton for a minute was
[02:08:33.775 --> 02:08:39.624]  It was raining, they ducked in some place to get out of the rain with the camera and got grabbed and later that afternoon it was raining.
[02:08:40.126 --> 02:08:48.990]  Yes it was, and that sounds pretty close because if these police were saying that as soon as they get away from the crowd, we're going to go ahead and take them down, then that had to be what happened.
[02:08:49.010 --> 02:08:52.511]  Well, he thinks they're listening to his phone, so he won't say much over it.
[02:08:53.451 --> 02:08:58.993]  All Terry Melton has done is videotape things, so of course they'll probably make something up.
[02:08:59.174 --> 02:08:59.994]  Let's all pray for him.
[02:09:00.214 --> 02:09:01.334]  Let's go to Elaine Brown.
[02:09:01.414 --> 02:09:02.555]  Stay right there, Mackenzie.
[02:09:02.855 --> 02:09:05.076]  Elaine, does that fit any pieces of the puzzle for you?
[02:09:06.414 --> 02:09:10.775]  Well, I knew Terry and Danny had been arrested in New York.
[02:09:10.835 --> 02:09:16.417]  I didn't know if it was in Albany, where Danny lives, or if it was in New York City.
[02:09:18.038 --> 02:09:19.778]  But, you know, that fits in okay.
[02:09:20.018 --> 02:09:24.040]  Elaine, I agree with you that the feds are trying to scare people here doing this.
[02:09:24.380 --> 02:09:27.121]  But the point is, it is a scary situation.
[02:09:27.181 --> 02:09:28.301]  This is real.
[02:09:28.441 --> 02:09:31.162]  As you know, you're right in the middle of it, like no one else is.
[02:09:32.503 --> 02:09:33.404]  Yeah, it is.
[02:09:33.564 --> 02:09:35.967]  I mean, why else would they do all this?
[02:09:36.567 --> 02:09:42.133]  You know, the simple thing is, you know, years ago all they had to do was show the law and all of this would be avoided.
[02:09:42.674 --> 02:09:45.577]  But maybe they wouldn't have had all this fun if they had done that.
[02:09:45.917 --> 02:09:48.039]  Because I'm sure these guys are having a good old time.
[02:09:51.144 --> 02:09:51.905]  I don't know.
[02:09:52.085 --> 02:09:56.509]  It's a horrible thing when the government just runs rampant like this.
[02:09:56.970 --> 02:10:05.658]  You know, the Declaration of Independence tells us that when the government no longer serves the needs of the people, it's time to remove it and institute a new one.
[02:10:05.718 --> 02:10:07.180]  And that's what we have to do.
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:13.165]  We need a Third Continental Congress to get us back to where we're supposed to be.
[02:10:13.266 --> 02:10:15.488]  Go back to the Articles of Confederation.
[02:10:16.298 --> 02:10:17.859]  Elaine, I have a question for you.
[02:10:17.879 --> 02:10:35.326]  If they were going to give 30 million illegal aliens, they said 14 million, it doesn't matter 14 million or 30 million, it was in the congressional bill that almost passed, total amnesty for no income taxes for five years retroactively, why then, if they wanted to de-escalate this, why couldn't they do that for U.S.
[02:10:35.366 --> 02:10:35.806]  citizens?
[02:10:36.526 --> 02:10:37.586]  Right, exactly.
[02:10:37.867 --> 02:10:39.367]  Exactly right, Alex.
[02:10:43.869 --> 02:10:44.729]  What can you say?
[02:10:44.829 --> 02:10:55.318]  It's all part of the cronal activity that just pervades our entire government system, from the local level all the way up to the feds.
[02:10:56.018 --> 02:10:58.120]  And we've got to change it, everybody.
[02:10:58.180 --> 02:11:02.683]  We have got to change it, or we are really going to be in total slavery.
[02:11:02.964 --> 02:11:04.405]  I'm really worried about these guys.
[02:11:05.105 --> 02:11:09.629]  They've got these trumped-up charges that they probably made up on the spot.
[02:11:10.939 --> 02:11:14.522]  That has nothing to do with anything that these gentlemen have done.
[02:11:14.882 --> 02:11:15.983]  Well, I know this, Elaine.
[02:11:16.003 --> 02:11:21.167]  They can half-bake the other charges, but this one's clearly a fraud.
[02:11:21.227 --> 02:11:25.250]  Possession and use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.
[02:11:26.471 --> 02:11:31.055]  Now, there has been no crime of violence other than them tasering him and shooting at him.
[02:11:31.415 --> 02:11:33.717]  They've now admitted to that, and that's like the Davidians.
[02:11:33.737 --> 02:11:35.218]  They were found not guilty of murder,
[02:11:36.339 --> 02:11:37.019]  We're good to go.
[02:11:51.989 --> 02:11:53.390]  But they still are in prison!
[02:11:53.670 --> 02:11:56.492]  I think most of them just got out after 12, 13 years.
[02:11:56.613 --> 02:11:58.334]  Or I guess even longer now.
[02:11:58.694 --> 02:12:05.159]  So this is absolutely amazing that they would come up... I mean, are these feds this stupid?
[02:12:06.040 --> 02:12:07.881]  I guess they just don't care of the charge.
[02:12:08.201 --> 02:12:09.762]  It's just absolutely ridiculous.
[02:12:09.802 --> 02:12:13.825]  I mean, what would they say Danny had done with a firearm in the commission of a violent crime?
[02:12:14.566 --> 02:12:14.766]  Right.
[02:12:15.547 --> 02:12:15.727]  Right.
[02:12:15.767 --> 02:12:17.968]  Where's the violent crime other than what they did?
[02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:19.990]  Like we just said, you know?
[02:12:21.358 --> 02:12:23.119]  Well, how is Dad handling all this?
[02:12:24.359 --> 02:12:28.661]  Well, we're just kind of sitting and waiting for information to come in.
[02:12:30.021 --> 02:12:31.562]  No further information about them.
[02:12:32.422 --> 02:12:34.203]  We really don't know much at this point.
[02:12:35.203 --> 02:12:45.887]  So, hopefully by later today, after Bob and Danny have been into federal court here in Concord, we'll know more details.
[02:12:45.987 --> 02:12:50.269]  And hopefully we'll learn something about Jason, too, through a mutual friend.
[02:12:54.693 --> 02:12:55.835]  I'm really worried about them.
[02:12:56.455 --> 02:13:01.721]  I mean, we know what kind of criminals these marshals in courts are.
[02:13:02.402 --> 02:13:09.150]  You know, when the marshals actually say, we know the Browns committed no crimes, but we're going to go and get them anyway, we're told to.
[02:13:09.510 --> 02:13:10.892]  What does that tell you, everybody?
[02:13:11.383 --> 02:13:12.343]  That they're mercenaries.
[02:13:12.363 --> 02:13:13.384]  They're not law enforcement.
[02:13:13.404 --> 02:13:14.724]  They're not enforcing any laws.
[02:13:15.284 --> 02:13:16.564]  In fact, they're breaking laws.
[02:13:16.604 --> 02:13:24.487]  Now, the report is that Reno Gonzalez got arrested in Texas, and that the person that was with him told the press that they beat him up.
[02:13:24.787 --> 02:13:26.387]  Have you gotten any information on that?
[02:13:26.967 --> 02:13:27.327]  Really?
[02:13:27.427 --> 02:13:27.628]  No.
[02:13:27.648 --> 02:13:32.809]  This is the first I've heard of anything regarding Reno, other than that he had been arrested.
[02:13:33.504 --> 02:13:33.984]  No kidding.
[02:13:34.164 --> 02:13:47.009]  What do you think about the new statement by, quote, this was a tax case, Monier said Wednesday, that's the head marshal in the case, but over the last seven months the Browns have allegedly obstructed justice and encouraged others to assist them.
[02:13:47.369 --> 02:13:52.010]  Ed Brown has threatened to kill law enforcement and other government officials, so our message to the Browns is clear.
[02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:54.391]  Do the right thing, call us, and surrender peacefully.
[02:13:54.731 --> 02:13:56.672]  He's claiming now it's been escalated.
[02:13:56.692 --> 02:14:02.534]  I mean, where do you think he's getting this statement that Ed has threatened to kill federal officers?
[02:14:03.823 --> 02:14:05.464]  Ed has never threatened anyone.
[02:14:05.744 --> 02:14:06.585]  Ed has warned.
[02:14:06.885 --> 02:14:13.950]  He has told them, if you come at me and try to harm me or my wife, then I will defend.
[02:14:14.090 --> 02:14:16.331]  If you try to kill me, I will kill you.
[02:14:16.351 --> 02:14:17.232]  That's it.
[02:14:17.272 --> 02:14:18.132]  That's not a threat.
[02:14:18.453 --> 02:14:19.193]  That's a warning.
[02:14:19.893 --> 02:14:20.534]  A threat is
[02:14:20.922 --> 02:14:21.622]  I'm going to kill you.
[02:14:21.642 --> 02:14:24.963]  The warning is, if you try to kill me, I'm going to kill you.
[02:14:25.244 --> 02:14:37.968]  What about the reports we're getting that different individuals all over the country plan, I guess to kick off the second revolution like Lexington and Concord, if they go in and gun you guys down?
[02:14:39.865 --> 02:14:41.286]  I'm sorry, you broke up there.
[02:14:41.326 --> 02:14:42.066]  Say that again, please.
[02:14:42.466 --> 02:14:57.472]  Elaine, what about the reports we keep seeing on blogs and the internet and hearing about how there's a big army of people that plan to go out for federal judges and federal marshals and FBI and other people involved in the case that the second revolution may kick off if they go in on you guys?
[02:14:58.853 --> 02:15:09.177]  Well, we know there are people out there who have made the claim that if any harm comes to us, they will reciprocate to those who have caused the harm.
[02:15:09.707 --> 02:15:13.688]  That has nothing to do with us, but that's what we have been told.
[02:15:13.709 --> 02:15:18.050]  So that has nothing to do with you guys?
[02:15:18.970 --> 02:15:20.011]  Nope.
[02:15:20.371 --> 02:15:33.696]  In fact, I know of one case where a gentleman from somewhere in the Midwest called the marshals, gave them his name, address, and phone number, said, if you kill the Browns, I am going to come there and I am going to kill you.
[02:15:35.214 --> 02:15:36.415]  Again, I have no idea who did that.
[02:15:36.455 --> 02:15:36.915]  Sure, sure.
[02:15:36.935 --> 02:15:39.958]  Well, Elaine, let's just all pray that all of this ends peacefully.
[02:15:40.178 --> 02:15:41.318]  How could this end peacefully?
[02:15:41.659 --> 02:15:46.582]  I mean, what would it take for you to... I mean, what would they need to do for you guys to come out?
[02:15:48.384 --> 02:15:51.346]  Dismiss the case.
[02:15:51.466 --> 02:15:52.226]  That's the only way.
[02:15:56.509 --> 02:15:57.750]  Well, I hear you.
[02:15:57.971 --> 02:16:03.194]  I certainly hope that they would do that because... Yeah.
[02:16:03.274 --> 02:16:03.995]  That's the only way.
[02:16:04.625 --> 02:16:06.086]  You know, this is a land of peace.
[02:16:06.486 --> 02:16:08.187]  We have committed no crime.
[02:16:08.988 --> 02:16:10.189]  We have broken no law.
[02:16:11.390 --> 02:16:17.774]  And because we are living souls and we are not part of their corporation, we're not under their jurisdiction.
[02:16:17.794 --> 02:16:18.995]  We answer to God's laws.
[02:16:19.055 --> 02:16:19.535]  That's all.
[02:16:20.776 --> 02:16:24.258]  And here we stand and that is our position, Alex.
[02:16:25.819 --> 02:16:30.042]  Well, we need to pray for Danny Riley and Reno and everybody that's been arrested.
[02:16:30.082 --> 02:16:32.624]  I heard that Mr. Wolf, the militia commander, may be released.
[02:16:33.784 --> 02:16:34.465]  He's been released?
[02:16:35.089 --> 02:16:36.230]  No, I heard he may be released.
[02:16:36.250 --> 02:16:37.670]  That's floating around.
[02:16:38.310 --> 02:16:40.211]  Oh, well, that's the first I've heard of that.
[02:16:40.251 --> 02:16:40.671]  I don't know.
[02:16:40.691 --> 02:16:41.952]  I don't know.
[02:16:44.233 --> 02:16:49.455]  So you have any other tidbits of info that you've gotten about the four arrestees?
[02:16:50.175 --> 02:16:51.456]  I have absolutely nothing, Alex.
[02:16:51.476 --> 02:16:55.538]  Some of the things you've told me today are news to me.
[02:16:55.978 --> 02:16:58.279]  As you know, I don't have much communication ability.
[02:16:59.750 --> 02:17:04.691]  Well, I think it's important to keep communication lines open with the feds.
[02:17:04.791 --> 02:17:06.532]  I mean, are you guys ever talking to them anymore?
[02:17:06.552 --> 02:17:06.592]  No.
[02:17:07.812 --> 02:17:14.673]  I mean, since they shut off our mail, our internet, our phone, how are they going to contact us?
[02:17:15.754 --> 02:17:19.115]  Steven Moynia, we have never spoken with Mr. Moynia.
[02:17:19.575 --> 02:17:20.875]  He has never contacted us.
[02:17:23.658 --> 02:17:26.280]  There was the FBI agent dressed like a hillbilly that didn't come in.
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.542]  He's the real commander behind all this from what we've got.
[02:17:29.163 --> 02:17:34.187]  Elaine, we've got to break quickly, but I've got a few other questions I'd like to ask you.
[02:17:34.207 --> 02:17:34.808]  Can you stay with us?
[02:17:35.308 --> 02:17:35.649]  Okay.
[02:17:35.929 --> 02:17:36.269]  Thank you.
[02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:40.073]  Be right back with Elaine Brown from New Hampshire.
[02:17:40.093 --> 02:17:40.513]  Stay with us.
[02:17:47.424 --> 02:17:58.694]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:17:58.914 --> 02:18:02.397]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:18:02.677 --> 02:18:06.879]  Cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:18:07.159 --> 02:18:17.864]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide and it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:18:18.084 --> 02:18:23.567]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:18:23.807 --> 02:18:30.150]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or
[02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:32.771]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[02:18:32.831 --> 02:18:33.472]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[02:18:33.512 --> 02:18:35.412]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:18:35.452 --> 02:18:36.413]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:47.433 --> 02:18:48.474]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:48.875 --> 02:18:54.361]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:18:54.942 --> 02:18:55.442]  That's right.
[02:18:55.743 --> 02:18:58.646]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:18:59.447 --> 02:19:05.534]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:19:06.067 --> 02:19:13.771]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:19:14.211 --> 02:19:19.014]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:19:19.697 --> 02:19:24.700]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:25.500 --> 02:19:29.642]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:19:30.022 --> 02:19:30.242]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:30.262 --> 02:19:32.203]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:19:32.284 --> 02:19:32.584]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:32.884 --> 02:19:33.164]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:46.041 --> 02:19:54.088]  Hi, this is Jeff Rentz, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[02:19:54.468 --> 02:20:03.776]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[02:20:04.156 --> 02:20:08.460]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:21.051]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineralite compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[02:20:21.331 --> 02:20:26.275]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[02:20:26.655 --> 02:20:30.018]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[02:20:30.379 --> 02:20:31.900]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:34.362]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[02:20:34.382 --> 02:20:35.443]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[02:20:36.704 --> 02:20:38.545]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[02:20:39.366 --> 02:20:44.490]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[02:20:45.290 --> 02:20:46.331]  Hey, Jack Blood here.
[02:20:46.551 --> 02:20:52.555]  I think that if we could see the germs' potential biohazards all around us in our daily surroundings, we would turn into Howard Hughes.
[02:20:52.856 --> 02:20:57.059]  We try not to think about it, primarily because we might think there's nothing we can do about it.
[02:20:57.379 --> 02:20:58.119]  Not so fast.
[02:20:58.199 --> 02:20:59.480]  Now there is a solution.
[02:20:59.660 --> 02:21:03.843]  I'm talking about Hazurid Complete Protection Kit, available now at Hazurid.com.
[02:21:04.924 --> 02:21:13.632]  This is the single solution that is tame enough to safely conquer everyday household and business cleaning chores, yet strong enough to decontaminate biological hazards.
[02:21:13.832 --> 02:21:18.336]  Hazurid fights infectious disease and unsurpassed odor, mold, and allergens.
[02:21:18.416 --> 02:21:22.980]  This is an amazing, state-of-the-art disinfectant with a no-questions-asked guarantee.
[02:21:23.121 --> 02:21:27.024]  Safe for kids and pets, and indispensable for your home, car, or business.
[02:21:27.104 --> 02:21:29.126]  Wherever you go, take Hazurid with you.
[02:21:29.286 --> 02:21:33.047]  Call them now to order 800-675-0323.
[02:21:33.107 --> 02:21:36.028]  That's 800-675-0323.
[02:21:36.188 --> 02:21:39.750]  Or go to the web, www.hazarid.com.
[02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:42.711]  H-A-Z-A-R-I-D, hazarid.com.
[02:21:42.931 --> 02:21:43.991]  Tell them Jack Blood sent you.
[02:21:52.394 --> 02:21:55.695]  Boy, I guess this song goes both ways for the Browns and the Feds.
[02:21:56.575 --> 02:21:58.136]  Meanwhile, the Globalists just laugh.
[02:22:10.728 --> 02:22:15.769]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:15.909 --> 02:22:17.589]  Elaine Brown's our guest.
[02:22:17.689 --> 02:22:28.051]  I'm going to get into Building 7 and 9-11 news in the last 30 minutes.
[02:22:37.088 --> 02:22:39.691]  I want Mackenzie to be able to pop in with some final comments as well.
[02:22:40.311 --> 02:22:45.476]  Elaine, where do you see all this going?
[02:22:48.800 --> 02:22:50.241]  Alex, so many people ask that.
[02:22:50.401 --> 02:22:51.402]  I have no idea.
[02:22:51.623 --> 02:22:53.044]  We're sitting here in peace.
[02:22:53.665 --> 02:22:56.267]  We have friends come to visit us in peace.
[02:22:56.447 --> 02:22:57.388]  We do nothing.
[02:22:57.408 --> 02:23:00.912]  There's no violence here.
[02:23:01.956 --> 02:23:04.837]  There's just, we're on the land that belongs to the Lord.
[02:23:04.938 --> 02:23:08.579]  We're just peaceful people sitting here, minding our own business.
[02:23:09.059 --> 02:23:13.801]  Okay, Alex, I have a guest here.
[02:23:14.382 --> 02:23:17.303]  Let's let him tell you what it's like here right now.
[02:23:18.664 --> 02:23:19.604]  Hi Alex.
[02:23:21.045 --> 02:23:22.185]  Welcome, who's this?
[02:23:22.845 --> 02:23:23.986]  I'm just a guest.
[02:23:24.346 --> 02:23:26.527]  I've been here since Tuesday night.
[02:23:27.849 --> 02:23:31.571]  I was at Ground Zero right before Danny and everybody got arrested there.
[02:23:31.591 --> 02:23:32.931]  I left there to come here.
[02:23:33.532 --> 02:23:39.815]  But we're just sitting around and it's probably one of the most boring places that anybody could imagine.
[02:23:39.975 --> 02:23:45.617]  There's nothing going on and what they're saying is just so much total bull.
[02:23:47.778 --> 02:23:52.100]  I don't know where they're going to go with what they're thinking and trying to convince everybody of.
[02:23:55.673 --> 02:23:56.734]  That's what's going on here.
[02:23:56.854 --> 02:23:59.095]  We're just sitting around.
[02:23:59.335 --> 02:24:05.699]  My only hope is that violence never occurs in any of this because it can be used for a police state expansion.
[02:24:05.759 --> 02:24:09.882]  It can also hurt the Browns and others.
[02:24:11.203 --> 02:24:16.586]  And to see these four men arrested and to now have the string of charges placed on them
[02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:19.271]  It's upsetting.
[02:24:19.531 --> 02:24:21.012]  Is Ed Brown there by the phone?
[02:24:21.192 --> 02:24:22.232]  Yeah, Alex, I'm here.
[02:24:22.272 --> 02:24:23.373]  I just heard your statement.
[02:24:23.393 --> 02:24:25.775]  Yeah, Alex, it doesn't make any difference.
[02:24:26.295 --> 02:24:30.057]  You can't be responsible, number one, for anybody else's action except our own.
[02:24:30.498 --> 02:24:31.298]  That's number one.
[02:24:31.879 --> 02:24:33.580]  How many people they arrest in correction?
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:35.201]  That's a police state mentality.
[02:24:35.221 --> 02:24:36.481]  That's what they do, is it not?
[02:24:37.562 --> 02:24:37.822]  Yes.
[02:24:38.443 --> 02:24:38.903]  Well, okay.
[02:24:38.923 --> 02:24:43.466]  So, I mean, if they arrest 100 people because of Brown's interest, well, what am I supposed to do about that?
[02:24:45.249 --> 02:24:46.950]  I'm not saying you're supposed to do anything.
[02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:51.632]  I'm just trying to find some way out of this.
[02:24:53.133 --> 02:24:54.774]  We know what's wrong, what's happened to you.
[02:24:55.234 --> 02:25:12.363]  We know they want a confrontation, but at the same time... The only way, you say, a way out of this is if those people on the federal side would turn themselves into the closest local convenient prison and end the nonsense and the criminal activity that they're conducting.
[02:25:13.717 --> 02:25:20.481]  Because I'm not going to change, my wife is not going to change, other people around the country are not going to change and become criminals because they say so.
[02:25:21.941 --> 02:25:31.807]  Ed, what do you think of this statement by Monier, the federal marshal, saying this was a tax case, but over the last seven months the Browns have allegedly obstructed justice and encouraged others to assist them.
[02:25:31.867 --> 02:25:37.010]  Ed Brown has threatened to kill law enforcement and other government officials, so our message to the Browns is clear.
[02:25:37.450 --> 02:25:39.571]  Do the right thing, call us, and surrender peacefully.
[02:25:41.012 --> 02:25:43.333]  Do the right thing and go hang yourself, Mr. Monier.
[02:25:43.925 --> 02:25:50.312]  You're a criminal from day one, along with all of your agents, along with the judge and every other federal agent involved in this case so far.
[02:25:50.852 --> 02:25:51.733]  You've broken the law.
[02:25:52.434 --> 02:25:53.575]  You continue to break the law.
[02:25:53.795 --> 02:25:56.518]  We have done not a single solitary thing to sit here
[02:25:57.060 --> 02:26:01.522]  And make a few statements, and none of the statements were violent or aggressive.
[02:26:01.542 --> 02:26:03.402]  They just were from a defensive position.
[02:26:03.562 --> 02:26:04.703]  We have warned everybody.
[02:26:05.103 --> 02:26:06.263]  Outside of that, we've done nothing.
[02:26:06.443 --> 02:26:07.404]  Well, Ed, I know this.
[02:26:07.564 --> 02:26:08.184]  Ed, I know this.
[02:26:08.304 --> 02:26:17.527]  It certainly is a false charge to claim that Danny, Riley, and others had possession and use of a firearm in relation
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:19.641]  Uh, to the crime of violence.
[02:26:19.661 --> 02:26:20.381]  Where's the violence?
[02:26:21.002 --> 02:26:22.442]  You know, I think they arrested them.
[02:26:41.644 --> 02:26:41.904]  Yes.
[02:26:41.924 --> 02:26:43.426]  They can do whatever they want to do.
[02:26:43.466 --> 02:26:46.028]  It's not my concern or my affair.
[02:26:46.088 --> 02:26:49.791]  I'm sorry that my four of my friends here now have been picked up.
[02:26:49.811 --> 02:26:50.672]  I wouldn't allow it.
[02:27:07.947 --> 02:27:10.328]  Uh, for myself, they do what they're gonna do.
[02:27:10.769 --> 02:27:11.709]  Well Ed, stay there!
[02:27:11.989 --> 02:27:12.490]  Stay there!
[02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:17.192]  Because we've got a quick break, we'll be back in three minutes, and I'd like to be able to talk to you a few more minutes.
[02:27:17.632 --> 02:27:25.077]  I know you're very busy, but I know you've got a few more things you'd like to say, and my mind is racing here with so many questions I want to ask you.
[02:27:25.777 --> 02:27:29.219]  And we will get it more into the 9-11 anniversary if not today, tomorrow, folks.
[02:27:29.239 --> 02:27:32.581]  This is just breaking, and we go where the breaking important news is.
[02:27:36.053 --> 02:27:39.054]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.074 --> 02:27:42.735]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.857 --> 02:27:48.097]  This is Elizabeth Border.

[02:30:40.292 --> 02:30:41.453]  Let's go back to Ed Brown.
[02:30:55.985 --> 02:30:57.486]  Outside Plainfield, New Hampshire.
[02:30:57.586 --> 02:30:58.947]  Ongoing standoff.
[02:31:02.550 --> 02:31:03.410]  Very brave people.
[02:31:04.151 --> 02:31:07.493]  You know that's for sure, and we've been praying for them, and I just pray this ends peacefully.
[02:31:08.914 --> 02:31:15.519]  Ed, you know that the federal marshals are brainwashed minions of the New World Order, and they really believe the tax system, they believe all the fraud.
[02:31:15.999 --> 02:31:17.440]  They really believe mercury's good.
[02:31:17.600 --> 02:31:21.363]  MSNBC now says that lead in children's toys is good.
[02:31:21.563 --> 02:31:22.103]  I'm not kidding.
[02:31:22.123 --> 02:31:23.384]  You can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:31:24.539 --> 02:31:28.663]  They believe the lie, and you know it's not going to hurt the New World Order if they get hurt.
[02:31:28.763 --> 02:31:30.384]  It's not going to hurt the New World Order if you get hurt.
[02:31:31.365 --> 02:31:37.330]  And I thought they were trying to de-escalate things until they flew that helicopter so dangerously low over the crowd.
[02:31:37.930 --> 02:31:39.912]  That was extremely dangerous in that wooded area.
[02:31:41.493 --> 02:31:43.255]  I mean, even behind a hill, folks.
[02:31:43.275 --> 02:31:46.037]  They had it down behind the hill just a hundred yards from their house.
[02:31:48.239 --> 02:31:50.581]  These are provocative moves by the Feds.
[02:31:50.601 --> 02:31:51.541]  This is not a good sign.
[02:31:51.561 --> 02:31:51.902]  Do you agree?
[02:31:54.680 --> 02:31:55.521]  Ah, yes, I agree.
[02:31:58.283 --> 02:32:00.905]  Any comments on how they're trying, why they're trying to escalate?
[02:32:01.906 --> 02:32:02.206]  Sure.
[02:32:02.967 --> 02:32:03.967]  To scare the rest of you.
[02:32:06.309 --> 02:32:06.709]  That's all.
[02:32:07.710 --> 02:32:08.531]  Keep you all in line.
[02:32:08.651 --> 02:32:09.291]  Do what you're told.
[02:32:10.893 --> 02:32:11.733]  That's the only reason.
[02:32:12.974 --> 02:32:21.000]  It's all a... I just got through reading the protocols of the one of the elders of Zion again, and all of what they're doing today are in those protocols.
[02:32:23.122 --> 02:32:23.402]  Hmm.
[02:32:23.883 --> 02:32:24.303]  Interesting.
[02:32:26.957 --> 02:32:32.962]  I mean, I know you don't like to look off into the future, but how long is this going to go on?
[02:32:34.883 --> 02:32:40.428]  As long as they keep breaking the law, I'm going to keep obeying the law and do exactly what the law says as far as the timetable is concerned.
[02:32:40.448 --> 02:32:40.848]  Who knows?
[02:32:41.609 --> 02:32:43.590]  Until they do the right thing.
[02:32:43.631 --> 02:32:47.293]  Have you had any feds creeping around your house again?
[02:32:47.313 --> 02:32:48.815]  I have no idea.
[02:32:48.835 --> 02:32:50.416]  The dog hasn't spotted anything.
[02:32:50.436 --> 02:32:51.797]  She's gone on alert a few times.
[02:32:53.198 --> 02:32:56.441]  What have you done in the past whenever the dog alerts or you think somebody's in the woods?
[02:32:58.260 --> 02:32:59.781]  No, I have a lot of things in the woods.
[02:33:01.643 --> 02:33:03.004]  No, we didn't have the dog before.
[02:33:03.224 --> 02:33:05.145]  That's right, I did not have the dog before.
[02:33:05.165 --> 02:33:06.606]  I only had the dog a short time, Alex.
[02:33:09.108 --> 02:33:18.135]  But in the past, I mean, not the distant past, but the recent, last few months, there hasn't been any other incidences since the firing of guns?
[02:33:18.215 --> 02:33:20.617]  No, there hasn't been.
[02:33:21.557 --> 02:33:27.442]  And like I told Mr. Moynihan anyway, you know, way back when, I said, hey, or somebody, I said, I forget who it was,
[02:33:28.055 --> 02:33:29.016]  Well, yeah, somebody.
[02:33:29.536 --> 02:33:34.579]  I said, hey, maybe if they're sneaking around the woods and stuff, then maybe I'll just start taking random shots into the woods.
[02:33:34.920 --> 02:33:35.680]  Just for the heck of it.
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:36.741]  I live way out in the woods.
[02:33:36.761 --> 02:33:39.163]  There's nothing in my woods except wildlife.
[02:33:39.963 --> 02:33:43.405]  And the wildlife, the deer and the bear and the moose usually let me know that they're there.
[02:33:43.425 --> 02:33:45.807]  So if there's any other stuff, maybe I'll just take a shot here and there.
[02:33:46.327 --> 02:33:46.988]  For the heck of it.
[02:33:48.849 --> 02:33:51.271]  Maybe I'll target practice on certain leaves in the trees.
[02:33:52.692 --> 02:33:54.953]  It's a peaceful land here.
[02:33:54.993 --> 02:33:55.834]  There is no problems.
[02:33:55.854 --> 02:33:57.215]  This land has no ghosts.
[02:33:58.366 --> 02:34:04.471]  I am not going to tolerate tomfoolery from administration in this country or any other country against this nation.
[02:34:04.491 --> 02:34:13.998]  I am a United States Constitution arranger bound by oath and conviction as a man of honor to stand by and protect this nation and its laws at any and all cost and I'm going to do that.
[02:34:15.012 --> 02:34:16.994]  And I understand your stand, and I admire it.
[02:34:17.595 --> 02:34:25.081]  My concern, and many other people's concern, is that they would like to have a bloody escalation with you to then cause reprisals.
[02:34:25.101 --> 02:34:28.525]  This is the higher-ups above the people they're sitting against you who don't get the full picture.
[02:34:28.825 --> 02:34:30.867]  I have nothing to do with me at all, Alex.
[02:34:30.967 --> 02:34:32.608]  Whatever happens here, happens here.
[02:34:33.149 --> 02:34:38.173]  Whatever happens here is between any criminal element and myself, or my wife and myself.
[02:34:38.534 --> 02:34:39.735]  Of course, my dog and my cat.
[02:34:40.512 --> 02:34:44.475]  That's why I've taken the safeties off here to give them the invitation to go ahead and do their thing.
[02:34:44.715 --> 02:34:45.716]  They're welcome to do so.
[02:34:45.736 --> 02:34:52.080]  We're not here trying to hide anything or put any big barricades up or obstacles in their way.
[02:34:52.140 --> 02:34:52.841]  It's wide open.
[02:34:54.622 --> 02:34:55.522]  So, go ahead.
[02:34:56.663 --> 02:34:58.204]  It's wide open?
[02:34:58.224 --> 02:35:00.166]  You were saying you had things in the woods, though.
[02:35:00.606 --> 02:35:01.226]  Yeah, so what?
[02:35:03.348 --> 02:35:04.268]  It's still wide open.
[02:35:05.209 --> 02:35:06.310]  They're still welcome to come in.
[02:35:07.116 --> 02:35:18.097]  Well, I've tried to keep this from getting violent, and I've tried to shed as much light on your plight as I can, but can you understand how
[02:35:19.196 --> 02:35:37.087]  Myself and others are having great success in a peaceful information war, one which you wage as well, to wake up America and why we might not, I understand they're coming at you, you're not coming at them, but you might understand why we want to de-escalate this because we don't want this to turn into some type of mass shooting war.
[02:35:39.268 --> 02:35:44.251]  We don't either, but I can't help what happens in this country, what happens in history.
[02:35:44.884 --> 02:35:47.125]  I mean, you can't save a nation with words.
[02:35:47.245 --> 02:35:48.166]  I've never seen it done.
[02:35:48.546 --> 02:35:49.706]  It wasn't done with Gandhi.
[02:35:49.766 --> 02:35:52.287]  Gandhi in India, right?
[02:35:52.888 --> 02:35:54.849]  He lost millions of people by doing it that way.
[02:35:54.889 --> 02:35:55.849]  He wouldn't have done it that way.
[02:35:55.869 --> 02:35:57.270]  He would have done it with guns if he had them.
[02:35:57.710 --> 02:35:58.730]  But they didn't have the weapons.
[02:35:58.750 --> 02:36:02.072]  Actually, he was beaten and jailed and tortured quite a bit.
[02:36:02.452 --> 02:36:02.892]  Of course.
[02:36:04.113 --> 02:36:09.815]  But I'm talking about the way they took over the country again and gained their freedom again, to some degree.
[02:36:09.835 --> 02:36:13.137]  It was the way that Gandhi did it.
[02:36:16.665 --> 02:36:18.607]  I really don't think Gandhi said that, though.
[02:36:22.850 --> 02:36:23.510]  Ed, listen.
[02:36:24.071 --> 02:36:31.136]  I mean, I've seen this stuff come and go, and I've seen it happen over and over again, and we don't want a new Waco.
[02:36:31.256 --> 02:36:34.859]  I know the feds are despicable and wicked and liars and evil and it's a fraud.
[02:36:35.679 --> 02:36:36.580]  I understand all that.
[02:36:36.620 --> 02:36:38.361]  I'm not arguing with you about that.
[02:36:39.362 --> 02:36:40.323]  I'm simply stating
[02:36:41.349 --> 02:36:43.131]  Yeah, they haven't so far.
[02:36:43.191 --> 02:36:46.733]  They just keep coming in with their little toys and stuff.
[02:37:06.736 --> 02:37:09.037]  Have there been any other aircraft or helicopters in there?
[02:37:09.057 --> 02:37:16.219]  About two or three times a week that little white Cessna that's parked down in Lebanon Airport, uh, flies over here.
[02:37:17.419 --> 02:37:18.740]  Outside of that, no, it's very quiet.
[02:37:18.760 --> 02:37:19.760]  It's very quiet up here.
[02:37:19.980 --> 02:37:21.561]  All the commotion is outside.
[02:37:21.581 --> 02:37:22.161]  I understand.
[02:37:22.441 --> 02:37:31.524]  Do you think the helicopter that was flying dangerously low for hours, uh, a few months ago there during the festivities was trying to get somebody to shoot at it?
[02:37:32.664 --> 02:37:32.864]  Sure.
[02:37:33.204 --> 02:37:34.184]  That was my first thought.
[02:37:35.045 --> 02:37:36.165]  Just by the way he was acting.
[02:37:36.847 --> 02:37:42.169]  I have to tell the Feds, that was really bad, foolish, dangerous for the pilot, dangerous for the people on the ground.
[02:37:43.910 --> 02:37:47.091]  They're paid half a million bucks a year anyway, the pilot and those other folks.
[02:37:48.092 --> 02:37:51.073]  That's the risk they take, that's why they get the high paying jobs.
[02:37:52.874 --> 02:37:55.375]  There's nobody here that would have fired a shot anyway, but I know of.
[02:37:55.995 --> 02:37:57.576]  Nobody has any interest in doing any of that.
[02:37:58.376 --> 02:38:01.057]  I understand, they were doing that trying to have you fire a shot.
[02:38:01.795 --> 02:38:07.641]  What I'm worried about is that the Feds might provoke her or something and at least shoot blanks or something at their own helicopter as a pretext to go in.
[02:38:23.740 --> 02:38:24.761]  Well, anything else?
[02:38:24.881 --> 02:38:26.282]  You've got the floor, Ed Brown.
[02:38:26.563 --> 02:38:29.225]  In the next two minutes, whatever you'd like to state, go ahead.
[02:38:29.245 --> 02:38:30.046]  I really don't.
[02:38:30.066 --> 02:38:32.448]  I don't have much to say in any of these two, except one.
[02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:36.051]  Well, yeah, my name is not Ed Brown.
[02:38:36.151 --> 02:38:37.152]  It hasn't been for a long time.
[02:38:37.172 --> 02:38:38.773]  We're trying to get folks to understand that.
[02:38:39.154 --> 02:38:43.938]  By the United States corporate government's method, that's what they do to you.
[02:38:44.538 --> 02:38:45.960]  They give everything in uppercase.
[02:38:45.980 --> 02:38:50.884]  In my case, it was Edward Lewis Brown, all in uppercase, the straw man they created.
[02:38:51.738 --> 02:38:57.263]  But my name is Edward Lewis under the laws, the laws that I operate under, of the Klan Brown.
[02:38:57.903 --> 02:39:00.285]  My wife is Elaine Ellis of the Klan Brown.
[02:39:01.346 --> 02:39:02.727]  Totally separate entities here.
[02:39:03.108 --> 02:39:05.189]  We just have to be of that Klan, that's all.
[02:39:06.350 --> 02:39:10.714]  But who we actually are under the eyes of the Creator, it makes us living souls.
[02:39:12.495 --> 02:39:14.257]  We are not ever part of their fiction.
[02:39:14.277 --> 02:39:14.717]  They know that.
[02:39:14.737 --> 02:39:19.461]  I mean, they separated the rest of the ties and contracts we had anyway.
[02:39:20.675 --> 02:39:22.857]  So we're not concerned about what a fiction does.
[02:39:23.217 --> 02:39:24.838]  We're not concerned about what they do.
[02:39:25.298 --> 02:39:27.320]  We'll do what the law tells us to do, and that's all.
[02:39:27.340 --> 02:39:36.566]  We're going to sit here like we are, very quietly, like a couple of old hill folks, just quietly looking, watching the world go by, and minding our own business.
[02:39:37.306 --> 02:39:39.208]  Well, you understand my position.
[02:39:40.411 --> 02:40:07.738]  Or do you understand my position, do you agree or disagree with it, that I understand they're trying to scare people, but at the same time I have a responsibility as trying to be a good shepherd for people to take my advice, to give my advice, that I really think women and children coming in and massing there and being there because of these wolves, that that really is a front line in the fight against the New World Order, and I don't really know if that's a place for women and children to be, Ed.
[02:40:10.023 --> 02:40:14.549]  Again, that's up to the men of the families and the mothers and fathers of the families.
[02:40:15.851 --> 02:40:16.592]  I have no say.
[02:40:16.652 --> 02:40:24.504]  I do understand what your position is, Alex, but again, most of the people that I know and that come here are not, shall I say, timid people?
[02:40:25.581 --> 02:40:27.603]  They're not concerned about that.
[02:40:27.643 --> 02:40:32.486]  They know that everybody must face freedom, and that the children must see that you have to fight for it.
[02:40:32.926 --> 02:40:33.587]  It's not a given.
[02:40:33.867 --> 02:40:50.739]  I understand what you're saying, and we see the escalation intensifying, and I don't like the rubber going down, but I understand you didn't create that road, you didn't create the juggernaut that's rolling down it menacingly, and that this whole thing is just spiraling downwards, and I just pray that there's some type of way to end this peacefully.
[02:40:51.179 --> 02:40:52.960]  I don't even see it spiraling downwards.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:53.981]  I don't understand that.
[02:40:54.594 --> 02:40:55.875]  I don't see anything at all.
[02:40:56.335 --> 02:41:02.179]  All I've ever said to these people from day one, way back ten plus years ago, is show me the law and I'll pay the taxes.
[02:41:02.199 --> 02:41:08.283]  They would never be... No, I know, but they have escalated it by arresting people and now charging them with... That's up to them.
[02:41:08.303 --> 02:41:11.105]  They want to be the monsters that they're appearing to be in the public eye.
[02:41:11.386 --> 02:41:12.366]  That's totally up to them.
[02:41:12.426 --> 02:41:14.608]  It has nothing at all to do with my wife or my self-care.
[02:41:14.928 --> 02:41:15.228]  Nothing.
[02:41:15.548 --> 02:41:16.129]  I understand.
[02:41:16.209 --> 02:41:19.631]  Ed, can I have you back up tomorrow for a longer update?
[02:41:21.112 --> 02:41:21.653]  Uh, yeah.
[02:41:21.673 --> 02:41:22.033]  What time?
[02:41:23.459 --> 02:41:25.481]  First, 30 minutes into the show.
[02:41:25.501 --> 02:41:26.902]  1130 Central, 1230 Eastern.
[02:41:26.942 --> 02:41:28.944]  Yeah, that's clear.
[02:41:29.885 --> 02:41:35.650]  Okay, we'll call this same number, and if you've got a new number or we don't call you, please call into the board.
[02:41:36.110 --> 02:41:36.610]  Thank you, Ed.
[02:41:36.650 --> 02:41:37.932]  We're praying for you and your wife.
[02:41:38.452 --> 02:41:38.912]  Thank you, sir.
[02:41:39.433 --> 02:41:39.733]  Bye-bye.
[02:41:40.093 --> 02:41:40.414]  You bet.
[02:41:40.434 --> 02:41:45.638]  I meant to have Luke Rodowski on to talk about the incredible things that happened in the four days of demonstrations in New York.
[02:41:45.818 --> 02:41:49.982]  I have the Kevin McPadden interview about the bombs in the buildings.
[02:41:51.980 --> 02:42:02.663]  And the countdown, and I read on Dig the comments from people calling us idiots, calling us morons, saying this isn't proof of bombs in the buildings, saying popular mechanics has debunked us.
[02:42:03.183 --> 02:42:07.284]  We have video of police saying, get back, they're going to blow the building up.
[02:42:08.004 --> 02:42:13.325]  We have eyewitnesses, police, firemen, medics, emergency workers, saying there was a countdown.
[02:42:13.585 --> 02:42:18.247]  We have the owners saying they gave the order to pull it, and they watched the building come down.
[02:42:18.307 --> 02:42:19.547]  You're living in denial.
[02:42:22.458 --> 02:42:24.198]  You're living in total and complete denial.
[02:42:24.238 --> 02:42:27.559]  I've got two sponsors, and we're going to go to Luke Brodowski.
[02:42:27.879 --> 02:42:31.760]  These sponsors make this podcast possible, and we go out and find the best sponsors possible.

[02:43:27.702 --> 02:43:36.870]  And speaking of foods for your body, if everything goes to Hades in a hand basket, you need to be prepared to at least have, per person in your family, a two month supply.
[02:43:37.150 --> 02:43:39.993]  Then you can supplement it with other food supplies and get four to six months out of it.
[02:43:40.393 --> 02:43:41.654]  I recommend that to everybody.
[02:43:41.754 --> 02:43:42.655]  Very inexpensive.
[02:43:42.695 --> 02:43:43.716]  Hundreds and hundreds of meals.
[02:43:43.976 --> 02:43:45.318]  About a dollar and a half a piece.
[02:43:45.618 --> 02:43:48.080]  Fifty percent more than the average person needs in calories.
[02:43:48.100 --> 02:43:48.921]  These are big meals.
[02:43:49.988 --> 02:43:52.711]  They're the longest operating company in the U.S.
[02:43:52.911 --> 02:43:54.833]  It's the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[02:43:55.454 --> 02:43:57.056]  Steve Schenck doing a fabulous job.

[02:44:32.763 --> 02:44:33.604]  Everything's going wild.
[02:44:33.644 --> 02:44:35.105]  Everything's going crazy right now.
[02:44:35.665 --> 02:44:37.046]  Again, just to see people
[02:44:38.380 --> 02:44:44.082]  Denying that this is, all this together, all these firemen, police, video of them saying it as it happens.
[02:44:44.702 --> 02:44:50.845]  A video of the head of Democracy Now!, Amy Goodman, down there getting the word.
[02:44:50.865 --> 02:44:51.825]  You see them all freaked out.
[02:44:51.845 --> 02:44:52.866]  You see them start running.
[02:44:53.306 --> 02:44:54.666]  And then the building starts falling.
[02:44:54.746 --> 02:44:57.487]  I mean, we have eyewitnesses that were there when it was happening.
[02:44:57.907 --> 02:44:59.448]  Over the radio, the countdown.
[02:44:59.748 --> 02:45:01.509]  They take their hand off the radio.
[02:45:01.809 --> 02:45:03.790]  Three, two, one, run for your lives!
[02:45:03.810 --> 02:45:03.930]  Boom!
[02:45:05.149 --> 02:45:07.470]  And now a video of Kevin McPadden on top of it.
[02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:08.910]  It's absolutely bomb.
[02:45:08.930 --> 02:45:13.392]  I mean, it's just a bombshell.
[02:45:13.492 --> 02:45:15.113]  It is huge.
[02:45:15.173 --> 02:45:16.113]  And I'm almost speechless.
[02:45:16.193 --> 02:45:18.334]  It's just so big, hidden in plain view right there.
[02:45:19.574 --> 02:45:22.215]  Luke, I want to get you up for at least 30, 40 minutes tomorrow.
[02:45:22.255 --> 02:45:23.055]  Maybe a full hour.
[02:45:23.075 --> 02:45:24.436]  I want to go over everything that happened.
[02:45:24.456 --> 02:45:25.576]  I meant to take calls on it.
[02:45:25.836 --> 02:45:27.877]  Then the Ed and Elaine Brown situation escalated.
[02:45:30.658 --> 02:45:33.980]  You've been out there, you've covered the story for We Are Change as a reporter.
[02:45:34.401 --> 02:45:35.541]  Comments on everything, Luke.
[02:45:36.022 --> 02:45:39.744]  I mean, first I just want to, you know, send out my prayers for Jason Reno and Danny.
[02:45:39.764 --> 02:45:43.466]  I hope the best, I wish the best for them for the situation that happens for them.
[02:45:43.807 --> 02:45:44.867]  It's a sad situation.
[02:45:44.887 --> 02:45:50.191]  We all need to stand behind these two American patriots because they're putting themselves on the line more than anybody else.
[02:45:50.531 --> 02:45:58.757]  But as far as, as far as, you know, Kevin McPadden, he's a proud member of We Are Change and he's only one of the many people who destroyed the official version of 9-11.
[02:45:59.757 --> 02:46:04.500]  I mean, we have Kevin McFadden, we have Craig Barber, we have David Miller, we have John Schroeder.
[02:46:04.820 --> 02:46:17.428]  And now, on that Tuesday night on 9-11-07, when William Rodriguez came to Judson Church and presented those two groundbreaking eyewitness testimonies that totally disfute the... Tell them!
[02:46:17.608 --> 02:46:18.889]  Break that down for folks!
[02:46:18.909 --> 02:46:19.930]  That's another huge breaking!
[02:46:19.990 --> 02:46:20.490]  I forgot!
[02:46:20.510 --> 02:46:21.270]  Tell them!
[02:46:21.290 --> 02:46:22.051]  That was amazing!
[02:46:22.091 --> 02:46:27.094]  I mean, William Rodriguez came with a video of two people who survived 9-11, who were in those buildings.
[02:46:28.855 --> 02:46:39.283]  And one of the guys, one of the eyewitnesses said that there was bombs going off in the elevators on the top floors of the Detroit Towers before the plane even hit the building.
[02:46:39.763 --> 02:46:44.186]  Now one of them was his supervisor in the building, and tell him the names, go over it, Luke.
[02:46:44.467 --> 02:46:51.732]  I don't have the names in front of me, but the second person was the supervisor from William Rodriguez, who basically just clarified his story and admitted it.
[02:46:52.072 --> 02:46:56.916]  I mean, we have William Rodriguez, we have John Frodo, we have the supervisor, we have Philippe David,
[02:46:57.216 --> 02:46:59.637]  Totally destroying the official story of 9-11.
[02:46:59.657 --> 02:47:01.877]  You have the Commission report ignoring these individuals.
[02:47:02.197 --> 02:47:04.718]  You have the story of 9-11 breaking through the truth.
[02:47:05.018 --> 02:47:07.559]  It's coming out and we are getting justice for all these people.
[02:47:07.839 --> 02:47:11.640]  And this is a great time to be alive because this is really groundbreaking stuff.
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:18.242]  I mean, what are they going to do as hundreds and hundreds of firefighters and police and emergency workers talk about the countdown for the bombs?
[02:47:18.302 --> 02:47:19.162]  I mean, what are they going to do?
[02:47:19.882 --> 02:47:20.783]  They can't do nothing.
[02:47:20.803 --> 02:47:24.065]  I mean, we have Craig Barber saying that he saw bombs go off in the building.
[02:47:24.105 --> 02:47:29.948]  We have the Loose Change guys interviewing two people who were inside those buildings who said that there was bombs exploding in those buildings.
[02:47:29.968 --> 02:47:31.129]  Those people can't come out yet.
[02:47:31.549 --> 02:47:35.031]  But, it's just, it's the story, the official story of 9-11.
[02:47:35.091 --> 02:47:37.912]  Well, one of them was the deputy head of emergency management.
[02:47:37.972 --> 02:47:38.793]  His name is out now.
[02:47:39.854 --> 02:47:40.775]  Yeah, these people are out.
[02:47:40.855 --> 02:47:43.378]  I mean, the story of 9-11, the truth is coming out.
[02:47:43.739 --> 02:47:44.399]  We are winning.
[02:47:44.660 --> 02:47:46.041]  We are fighting the info war.
[02:47:46.061 --> 02:47:50.747]  The London Guardian finally came out and said there's a cover-up and it could be an inside job.
[02:47:51.328 --> 02:47:56.274]  I mean, again, this is an amazing time to be alive because the truth is literally coming out.
[02:47:56.621 --> 02:47:58.362]  The mainstream media cannot ignore us.
[02:47:58.622 --> 02:48:00.263]  The government can't cover this up anymore.
[02:48:00.303 --> 02:48:02.125]  We have the truth on our side.
[02:48:02.205 --> 02:48:03.906]  I mean, this is really groundbreaking stuff.
[02:48:03.966 --> 02:48:17.575]  If anybody out there had any doubts about this, these people, like Kevin McPadden and the two people William Rodriguez fought for, these people, you know, should reassure us so much now.
[02:48:17.595 --> 02:48:19.356]  I mean, there's no way, man.
[02:48:19.436 --> 02:48:21.898]  I mean, we have truth and justice on our side.
[02:48:27.159 --> 02:48:32.043]  The universe builds and leans and bends towards justice and the truth.
[02:48:32.143 --> 02:48:35.886]  It literally bends towards justice and justice is going to come out.
[02:48:36.186 --> 02:48:40.930]  We're going to expose the fact that it's an inside job and nothing can stop that now.
[02:48:41.010 --> 02:48:42.051]  Stay with us, Luke Rudowsky.
[02:48:42.391 --> 02:48:43.492]  Final segment straight ahead.
[02:48:48.769 --> 02:48:51.913]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:48:52.314 --> 02:48:54.236]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.597 --> 02:49:02.227]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:02.938 --> 02:49:09.981]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.381 --> 02:49:21.806]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.126 --> 02:49:25.968]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.088 --> 02:49:28.049]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.349 --> 02:49:32.131]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:39.463 --> 02:50:53.768]  Hi, this is Jeff Rents, and if you're interested in suppressed and natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[02:50:54.148 --> 02:51:03.451]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[02:51:03.811 --> 02:51:08.133]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[02:51:08.613 --> 02:51:20.724]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineralite compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory, and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery, and arthritis.
[02:51:21.004 --> 02:51:25.948]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[02:51:26.328 --> 02:51:29.691]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound, and the best part?
[02:51:30.072 --> 02:51:31.573]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[02:51:31.633 --> 02:51:34.035]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[02:51:34.055 --> 02:51:35.977]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[02:51:36.377 --> 02:51:36.717]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[02:51:36.737 --> 02:51:37.338]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[02:51:58.729 --> 02:52:03.251]  We didn't have time to play the Kevin McPadden audio clip, but we have our own hour-long interview with him.
[02:52:03.271 --> 02:52:12.775]  We're going to be posting in the next few days up on PrisonPlanet.tv for members, and then it can be four wins from that point, but it's in higher quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:52:12.795 --> 02:52:24.421]  I mean, all of this together, in the aggregate, there's so many people going forward saying bombs going off, they were told to get back, we have cops on video saying it, and then
[02:52:25.382 --> 02:52:32.805]  On Dig, they go dig us down and bury the story and say, I just don't believe it, it's all a lie, you're just making all this up.
[02:52:34.366 --> 02:52:36.647]  And they refuse to even read it or watch the video clips.
[02:52:38.527 --> 02:52:40.668]  And we have cops saying, get back, they're going to blow it up.
[02:52:41.188 --> 02:52:41.949]  It's coming down.
[02:52:42.669 --> 02:52:49.732]  Then we have the media getting scripted early and false, false startings saying, Building 7 is going to come down before it did, or saying it had come down.
[02:52:50.382 --> 02:52:53.163]  I mean, Luke, it just becomes mind-blowing at a certain point.
[02:52:53.583 --> 02:52:57.524]  The official story is officially disproven at this point right now.
[02:52:57.564 --> 02:53:00.105]  I mean, there's nothing else the mainstream media can do.
[02:53:00.125 --> 02:53:01.365]  We have the truth on our side.
[02:53:01.405 --> 02:53:02.306]  We're doing our job.
[02:53:02.606 --> 02:53:05.447]  The media is complicit for not doing their job.
[02:53:05.507 --> 02:53:09.548]  I'm telling you right now, they belong in jail for treason for not covering this up.
[02:53:09.868 --> 02:53:11.288]  And to me, we are winning.
[02:53:11.368 --> 02:53:13.129]  It's a beautiful time to be alive.
[02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:16.330]  And I don't know about you, man, but I'm excited because we're kicking some butt.
[02:53:17.893 --> 02:53:18.553]  Well, we are.
[02:53:18.634 --> 02:53:21.956]  Just in a minute or two, break down what happened over the four days.
[02:53:22.256 --> 02:53:22.856]  Five days.
[02:53:23.256 --> 02:53:33.403]  The five days were amazing because Friday we had about 200 people outside David Rockefeller's house and we were chanting that 9-11 was a Rockefeller job and we definitely sent the message to him.
[02:53:33.703 --> 02:53:40.027]  Then we went to the CFR, we went to CCN, CNN, CBS, Fox 5 News and we definitely made our voices heard.
[02:53:40.387 --> 02:53:41.908]  Saturday was a great street action.
[02:53:41.928 --> 02:53:44.470]  I think Saturday was one of the best days when you came here, Alex.
[02:53:44.810 --> 02:53:48.072]  Well, we were at Times Square, just sending our message to the people.
[02:53:48.092 --> 02:53:53.675]  We were in the center of the world at Times Square, and we were letting everybody know that 9-1-1 was an inside job.
[02:53:53.875 --> 02:53:56.656]  Yeah, we now have all the, uh, Geraldo clips.
[02:53:56.676 --> 02:53:57.176]  We're going to play them.
[02:53:57.196 --> 02:53:57.717]  I'm going to do it today.
[02:53:57.737 --> 02:53:58.537]  We'll play them tomorrow.
[02:53:58.977 --> 02:54:02.959]  We now have all these other speeches and clips from other people speaking, myself speaking.
[02:54:03.460 --> 02:54:07.041]  Yeah, I mean, break down what that arrest was like, but taking over Fox, that was wonderful.
[02:54:07.322 --> 02:54:09.863]  Yeah, that was wonderful, and that really came out of nowhere, man.
[02:54:09.903 --> 02:54:13.745]  It was really like the Spirit was with us, because this was never planned.
[02:54:14.005 --> 02:54:16.827]  We just saw him on the Titans run, and we knew he was going live.
[02:54:16.867 --> 02:54:19.528]  He was in the area, and out of nowhere, we were like, alright, let's go.
[02:54:19.848 --> 02:54:25.952]  And it was the last minute decision, and we went, and it was really monumental, man, because they never go live.
[02:54:26.312 --> 02:54:40.140]  Fox 5 never goes live outside, and it really, we really took advantage of the situation and remade it ours, and we sent the message right to Fox 5, and we really, you know, disputed them, and what they did to you was really... You keep calling it Fox 5, that was national television!
[02:54:40.723 --> 02:54:41.844]  Yeah, Fox 5 News.
[02:54:42.304 --> 02:54:44.365]  And everybody saw us.
[02:54:44.425 --> 02:54:45.546]  Everybody heard our message.
[02:54:45.886 --> 02:54:48.608]  And the beautiful thing about it is, they couldn't do nothing about it.
[02:54:48.628 --> 02:54:51.870]  Geraldo couldn't even continue his program without being disrupted by us.
[02:54:52.230 --> 02:54:55.373]  And everybody heard us, and that's the beautiful part about it.
[02:54:55.673 --> 02:54:59.475]  And then the police got so mad, they really arrested you for no reason.
[02:55:00.376 --> 02:55:04.038]  They were supposed to issue you a warning about the sound device.
[02:55:04.258 --> 02:55:06.220]  They didn't issue a warning, they just arrested you.
[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:08.301]  That's unconstitutional, and that's un-American.
[02:55:08.741 --> 02:55:22.948]  And after that happened, we had about two, three hundred people just line up two by two, and we marched as an army, as Info Wars, as troops, and we were so organized and dedicated, we just marched about ten, fifteen blocks to the police precinct where they had you at.
[02:55:23.248 --> 02:55:25.089]  We lined up in front of the police precinct.
[02:55:25.329 --> 02:55:28.751]  The police officer never saw something like this in our lives.
[02:55:29.011 --> 02:55:30.772]  They all came out to the police precinct.
[02:55:30.892 --> 02:55:33.153]  It was like that scene in Malcolm X.
[02:55:33.713 --> 02:55:39.455]  Exactly, we all stood up, we all lined up and we started screaming, you know, let him go and free Alex Jones.
[02:55:39.515 --> 02:55:41.736]  And he even told me you were hearing it inside the precinct.
[02:55:42.136 --> 02:55:43.797]  Loud and clear, it was historical.
[02:55:44.257 --> 02:55:45.217]  My friend, we're out of time.
[02:55:45.237 --> 02:55:46.097]  We'll talk to you tomorrow.
[02:55:46.117 --> 02:55:47.998]  I apologize that we didn't go over all the 9-11 info.
[02:55:48.018 --> 02:55:50.679]  We covered about half of it today, the big building 7 news.
[02:55:51.659 --> 02:55:58.682]  But we're going to chronicle it all tomorrow, play the clips, unless there's some new horrid development or these arrests.
[02:55:58.782 --> 02:56:02.823]  And I tell you, I'm praying for the men that were arrested falsely.
[02:56:03.650 --> 02:56:08.292]  These are clearly false charges by the Federal Marshals and the FBI.
[02:56:09.032 --> 02:56:11.113]  Using a weapon in a violent crime?
[02:56:12.274 --> 02:56:13.855]  Read the exact charge.
[02:56:14.275 --> 02:56:17.336]  Possession and use of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence.
[02:56:18.256 --> 02:56:19.637]  Just a fraud on its face.
[02:56:20.177 --> 02:56:21.158]  God bless you all.
