[00:00:05.612 --> 00:00:06.254]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:07.979]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.701 --> 00:00:09.805]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:11.229]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:13.012]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:17.234]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.774 --> 00:00:21.875]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:43.268]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[00:00:43.348 --> 00:00:47.031]  It is another live edition right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:47.551 --> 00:00:52.495]  I'm Alex Jones, your wartime broadcaster in the battle for our Republic.
[00:00:53.275 --> 00:00:55.697]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:56.318 --> 00:00:59.200]  It is the 26th day of September 2007.
[00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:10.349]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, father of Reaganomics, chief economist for the first and second Reagan White House,
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:21.943]  Number two, at the Department of Treasury, will be joining us to walk through the financial unraveling that we have just begun to enter into.
[00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:23.263]  We're only on the edges.
[00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:35.486]  The first circle of Hades, and it's clear we'll be traveling to the frozen landscapes of the ninth circle, if this continues in the next couple of years.
[00:01:37.003 --> 00:01:43.345]  This is the slow, incremental, final decline of the United States according to globalist public designs.
[00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:46.286]  He is coming up in one hour and a half.
[00:01:47.326 --> 00:01:52.848]  Coming up in one hour for 30 minutes, we'll be joined with our monthly visit by Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:56.649]  We've been having him on more than once a month lately because so much is happening.
[00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.051]  He's very gracious to come on, syndicated columnist, former editor of Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:02.293 --> 00:02:10.479]  To talk about the economy and what we face at the hands of the central banks and the decisions that they have made.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:20.607]  In the meantime, every few months I have to come on air and basically publicly pillory myself.
[00:02:22.388 --> 00:02:23.770]  And this is why it's important.
[00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.294]  People all the time catch me in mistakes or I get numbers wrong or dates wrong.
[00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:30.915]  Yes, I'm a human being.
[00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:31.976]  I am fallible.
[00:02:33.946 --> 00:02:35.227]  I try to be accurate.
[00:02:35.247 --> 00:02:40.568]  I am more accurate than the vast majority of news reporters and pundits and political analysts.
[00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.510]  I'm a fierce constitutionalist, but it doesn't mean that I'm perfect.
[00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.110]  Far from it.
[00:02:47.211 --> 00:02:49.572]  And I drop the ball big time.
[00:02:49.992 --> 00:02:51.412]  Now, you drop the ball too.
[00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:56.054]  And I illustrate the dropping of the ball so that we don't drop the ball in the future.
[00:02:58.172 --> 00:03:09.336]  I've become so marinated in corruption and evil that I begin to swim in its ether and basically, I don't like the environment, but I accept the geopolitical environment as it gets darker and darker.
[00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:12.117]  That is, I accept it at a subconscious level.
[00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:22.420]  We have to reaffirm and consciously take control of our action against the New World Order and learn to recognize incredible threats to our liberties and freedoms when they arise.
[00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:26.262]  But we've been fighting this so long that
[00:03:29.153 --> 00:03:33.837]  You almost just get it in your mind that it's a foregone conclusion, and we cannot allow that to happen.
[00:03:33.897 --> 00:03:36.459]  We have to stay steely, stay focused.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.487]  Now, I dropped the ball semi the last two weeks with the new blanket amnesty bill, and you notice the media is not having a big debate about it.
[00:03:45.507 --> 00:03:47.288]  They're not having a big to-do about it.
[00:03:47.328 --> 00:03:54.174]  That's almost a shill within a shill, because they try to pass it by having a big public fight about it and lying about what it really does.
[00:03:55.339 --> 00:04:05.403]  And then, finally, when they really make a big push for it, they don't have a national debate about it, and then we don't hear the clamor of the enemy coming in silently in the night, and so we let it happen.
[00:04:06.843 --> 00:04:08.544]  I quasi-dropped the ball.
[00:04:08.604 --> 00:04:18.028]  Basically, I caught the ball, ran with it 20 yards, and then fumbled and dropped it, but then recovered it on the issue of the illegal aliens and this new push to end the U.S.
[00:04:18.068 --> 00:04:19.168]  sovereignty, and that's what it is.
[00:04:20.348 --> 00:04:23.550]  We've covered that some, not one-tenth as much as I should.
[00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:27.894]  I feel like somebody should slap me upside the head.
[00:04:27.934 --> 00:04:29.575]  This is life and death for this country.
[00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:39.162]  But I get so used to fighting it, so continually, you know, dealing with it, and fighting it, and battle after battle after battle, the enemy, quote, wears us out.
[00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:40.402]  We can't let them do that.
[00:04:41.723 --> 00:04:43.304]  But that's not where I dropped the ball.
[00:04:44.045 --> 00:04:45.526]  That's not the big fumble.
[00:04:46.427 --> 00:04:52.511]  I fumbled when I grabbed it from the center, and it went right into enemy hands, and it looks like
[00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:56.847]  They're on the one yard line about to score in sudden death overtime.
[00:04:57.668 --> 00:04:59.268]  It's bad, we'll cover when we get back.
[00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:02.310]  Terrorism.
[00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.210]  Terrorism.
[00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.373]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:05:09.633 --> 00:05:11.234]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:05:11.454 --> 00:05:13.955]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:05:14.315 --> 00:05:20.998]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne
[00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:22.039]  We're good to go.
[00:05:42.392 --> 00:05:47.757]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:49.859]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:09.495]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:17.502]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.012 --> 00:06:24.397]  Terror was that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:24.797 --> 00:06:36.206]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:40.069]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:40.509 --> 00:06:42.451]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:46.614]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:05.383]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself.
[00:07:05.802 --> 00:07:07.543]  So that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[00:07:08.064 --> 00:07:10.445]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[00:07:10.926 --> 00:07:18.652]  Now there's Night Skin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[00:07:19.192 --> 00:07:25.777]  Night Skin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[00:07:26.237 --> 00:07:31.461]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[00:07:32.122 --> 00:07:33.743]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[00:07:34.183 --> 00:07:35.144]  Try Night Skin today.
[00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:39.407]  And see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed, both inside and out.
[00:07:39.768 --> 00:07:43.771]  Try Night Skin risk-free by calling 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:47.434]  Night Skin is guaranteed to renew your skin overnight.
[00:07:47.715 --> 00:07:49.937]  Turning back the clock has never been this easy.
[00:07:50.297 --> 00:07:52.239]  Try Night Skin risk-free today.
[00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:52.919]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:53.179]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[00:08:05.194 --> 00:08:05.814]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.494 --> 00:08:07.575]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:09.376]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.036 --> 00:08:10.856]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.597 --> 00:08:12.517]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.158 --> 00:08:17.099]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.339 --> 00:08:21.481]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:29.045]  Alright, coming up in an hour and 25 minutes, we're gonna have, uh,
[00:08:30.712 --> 00:08:37.914]  Paul Craig Roberts, former Wall Street Journal editor, chief economist, Reagan White House, father of economics, coming on to talk about the economy, where it's going.
[00:08:37.974 --> 00:08:46.896]  Fellow Reserve and others say it's going to go down a long way over a long period of time, which is exactly what other globalist publications have stated two years ago.
[00:08:46.916 --> 00:08:50.717]  So they're just following their continued attack pattern, their continued operation against us.
[00:08:50.757 --> 00:08:51.677]  We'll break that down.
[00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:55.498]  Larry Pratt joins us in about an hour from now.
[00:08:55.518 --> 00:08:56.858]  He joins us in the second hour.
[00:08:57.439 --> 00:08:58.659]  Gun owners of America,
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:06.205]  I learned about this last Thursday, and for some reason didn't cover it Friday.
[00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:11.169]  Then I briefly spent about two minutes on it Sunday.
[00:09:11.189 --> 00:09:15.673]  I rarely feel like slapping myself.
[00:09:15.753 --> 00:09:17.034]  I literally feel like it.
[00:09:17.054 --> 00:09:17.594]  I'm angry.
[00:09:18.035 --> 00:09:21.898]  Because this is the most key central issue there is.
[00:09:22.799 --> 00:09:24.080]  It is the jewel of liberty.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:24.620]  Arms.
[00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.003]  When it all boils down to bedrock, to the very basis,
[00:09:28.641 --> 00:09:32.603]  That is your last-ditch parachute.
[00:09:33.304 --> 00:09:34.104]  It's firearms.
[00:09:34.284 --> 00:09:42.468]  And it's the capacity to use them and the will to use them in defense of your family, your community, from Nazi thugs and the like.
[00:09:43.629 --> 00:09:44.529]  The Commissariat.
[00:09:46.691 --> 00:09:47.911]  And I did not cover this.
[00:09:48.111 --> 00:09:49.972]  And I know that you're not that upset about it.
[00:09:50.012 --> 00:09:51.493]  I know that I don't hear much talk about it.
[00:09:53.014 --> 00:09:56.075]  I don't hear weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth.
[00:09:56.156 --> 00:09:56.736]  This is
[00:09:57.859 --> 00:10:02.963]  The biggest move we have ever seen against the Second Amendment in the United States.
[00:10:03.003 --> 00:10:04.885]  This is the worst bill we've ever seen.
[00:10:05.345 --> 00:10:06.866]  Bush says he will sign it.
[00:10:08.007 --> 00:10:10.810]  The Bush White House has been lobbying for it.
[00:10:11.971 --> 00:10:25.602]  They didn't triple the funding of the BATF and double the number of officers that the ATF has because they wanted to play Parcheesi.
[00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:29.612]  Or because they wanted to play badminton.
[00:10:30.232 --> 00:10:31.113]  This is not a game.
[00:10:33.474 --> 00:10:36.035]  And I read the bill finally last night.
[00:10:36.075 --> 00:10:39.597]  I'd only read subsections from gun owners last Thursday and then Sunday.
[00:10:40.257 --> 00:10:42.618]  And it was staggering in its implications.
[00:10:42.658 --> 00:10:47.180]  Now, I'm going to get into this article here in a moment.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.963]  Then we have massive news on the planned extermination of 80% of Humanity Front.
[00:10:53.303 --> 00:10:55.144]  It's now becoming total mainstream news.
[00:10:56.872 --> 00:11:00.934]  I wanted to make the Endgame film ten years ago, but never got around to it.
[00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:11.758]  Was too busy making police state films, martial law films, government-sponsored terror films, and then now was the time to make this film on eugenics and the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:11:12.239 --> 00:11:18.481]  And then as if someone flipped a switch in the last month, it suddenly has become a huge issue.
[00:11:18.501 --> 00:11:20.142]  It must be God working.
[00:11:20.754 --> 00:11:35.703]  You know, having me wait for some reason until this time, because now the enemy's being open about it, now the public's starting to talk about it, people are really paying attention to what I say right now on this issue, and Endgame couldn't be coming out at a better time.
[00:11:36.964 --> 00:11:37.765]  So I'm going to get into that.
[00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:42.928]  Paul Watson has a big article right now, if humans are a virus, then what is the Endgame?
[00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:54.331]  And we'll be breaking that down coming up in the next few minutes.
[00:11:57.233 --> 00:11:59.334]  But right now, let me get into the top story.
[00:12:00.455 --> 00:12:01.356]  Better late than never.
[00:12:01.476 --> 00:12:10.723]  And what happens is, and they have psychological studies on this, and even Clinton talked about it, and you know, they said, don't get refugee fatigue.
[00:12:10.783 --> 00:12:17.928]  Remember when he was wanting to hype everybody up to go into Serbia, and they were putting out, 90 plus percent of it was propaganda about the Serbs?
[00:12:18.658 --> 00:12:20.078]  They certainly weren't being friendly.
[00:12:20.118 --> 00:12:21.379]  Neither were the Croats or the Muslims.
[00:12:21.399 --> 00:12:23.699]  They've all been killing each other for hundreds of years.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:32.922]  But they would show UN refugee camps with people behind barbed wire and point video at it and say, look at them in concentration camps of the Serbs.
[00:12:32.982 --> 00:12:36.623]  And it was UN camps and they were sick people with diseases.
[00:12:36.663 --> 00:12:42.625]  They would have, they'd pick two or three people out of the camp and set them up against the fence and videotape them with their shirts off and pay them in food.
[00:12:43.325 --> 00:12:44.625]  They did that in the early 90s.
[00:12:44.665 --> 00:12:47.146]  The cover of Time Magazine you saw was that.
[00:12:47.995 --> 00:12:51.216]  And they did it again in the late nineties with the Serb attack.
[00:12:52.436 --> 00:12:53.557]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:12:53.817 --> 00:12:56.938]  Clinton said, listen, you don't care anymore about the images we're showing.
[00:12:56.978 --> 00:12:58.358]  The polls show you don't want the war.
[00:12:58.858 --> 00:13:00.539]  Don't get refugee fatigue.
[00:13:00.719 --> 00:13:02.820]  And they talk a lot about that in policy papers.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.280]  How their propaganda wears out.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.801]  Their, oh, the terrorists are going to get you.
[00:13:07.881 --> 00:13:09.241]  Oh, there's a boogeyman under the counter.
[00:13:09.542 --> 00:13:11.262]  See, even their fake disinfo.
[00:13:11.862 --> 00:13:12.602]  That wears out.
[00:13:12.682 --> 00:13:14.083]  Well, the truth wears out too.
[00:13:15.356 --> 00:13:40.363]  You make phone calls hundreds of times, you go to pro-US, anti-open borders rallies, you call into talk shows, you get upset about things, and after a while, after fighting it now for twenty years, and some of you longer, and the general public the last six years, seven years as Bush tries to do it each year, you finally just kind of, oh man, I've heard enough about it, or the same thing with gun control.
[00:13:41.007 --> 00:13:47.973]  They're always hitting, they're always attacking, from a hundred different angles to the point of where you're just like, again?
[00:13:48.053 --> 00:13:49.154]  You're doing it again?
[00:13:49.174 --> 00:13:55.819]  And Bush came into office, and what about Lister?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.501]  No one could be worse than Clinton.
[00:13:58.402 --> 00:14:08.330]  Alex, I know Bush is blocking Dan Burton from trying to prosecute Clinton and trying to have congressional hearings about Pardongate and Chinagate, but just let's just see what Bush does.
[00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:19.225]  And then he restricted the First Amendment with campaign finance reform, and then he started pushing gun control, he started increasing funding for BATF, and people said, oh, well at least he ain't Clinton!
[00:14:22.187 --> 00:14:34.855]  Until the point now where the NRA, which is completely compromised and controlled, will at least tell you, and Bob Barr on this show and other places has said, he's an NRA board member, former congressman, that Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton.
[00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:36.496]  And why is he?
[00:14:37.532 --> 00:14:40.254]  Tripling the size of the BATF, baby, that's why.
[00:14:40.694 --> 00:14:50.741]  That's A. B, all sorts of importation through executive orders and through regulatory fiat, just policy, they're blocking all sorts of importation.
[00:14:52.193 --> 00:15:06.104]  They're funding BATF programs in most major high schools, where the feds deputize a local deputy and the county gets $200,000 on average, the deputy's only $35,000 a year, the school gets a little bit of it, he goes in and has a semester, quote, law enforcement class.
[00:15:06.465 --> 00:15:08.186]  You think, oh, that's interesting for my son or daughter.
[00:15:08.246 --> 00:15:08.466]  No, no, no.
[00:15:08.727 --> 00:15:10.008]  It's all a spy class.
[00:15:10.088 --> 00:15:15.532]  We have the curricula, where they teach them, turn your parents in, what kind of guns they have, what's in the medicine cabinet.
[00:15:15.692 --> 00:15:17.234]  I mean, this is right out of Eastern Germany.
[00:15:17.994 --> 00:15:20.156]  This is more Soviet than Soviet.
[00:15:20.849 --> 00:15:22.870]  The Germans took the Soviet model to a new level.
[00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:29.932]  Merging the Nazi and Communist Russian system made quite a hybrid.
[00:15:29.952 --> 00:15:31.313]  Let me tell you, you ought to go study it.
[00:15:31.373 --> 00:15:31.733]  I have.
[00:15:33.613 --> 00:15:43.296]  So, all that's going on, and they're raiding gun shops everywhere, and they're shutting people down, they're raiding homes, and they're raiding veterans, and they're doing all this.
[00:15:43.737 --> 00:15:47.578]  Right when Bill Clinton, and here's the big news, right when Bill Clinton left office,
[00:15:52.289 --> 00:15:53.691]  80 plus thousand vets.
[00:15:54.251 --> 00:15:55.793]  And we heard about this before it was in the news.
[00:15:56.213 --> 00:15:58.716]  I started getting calls going, listen, I don't even have a misdemeanor.
[00:15:58.776 --> 00:16:00.678]  Alex, I haven't got a speeding ticket in my life.
[00:16:00.698 --> 00:16:03.701]  You know, I'm living here in Southern Alabama.
[00:16:03.741 --> 00:16:04.561]  I'm living here in Georgia.
[00:16:04.581 --> 00:16:05.442]  I'm living here in Florida.
[00:16:05.462 --> 00:16:06.283]  I'm living here in Texas.
[00:16:06.303 --> 00:16:07.104]  I got the same calls.
[00:16:07.504 --> 00:16:08.425]  I'm a grandfather.
[00:16:08.465 --> 00:16:09.106]  I went to buy
[00:16:10.015 --> 00:16:13.956]  I always tell this story until it just becomes like a nomenclature example.
[00:16:13.976 --> 00:16:14.736]  But this is a true story.
[00:16:14.756 --> 00:16:15.396]  I remember the caller.
[00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:16.497]  It was a bunch of them.
[00:16:16.897 --> 00:16:17.837]  I want to buy him a 22.
[00:16:18.137 --> 00:16:19.097]  He's 11 years old.
[00:16:19.117 --> 00:16:20.538]  And they said, no, you can't.
[00:16:20.878 --> 00:16:21.618]  You're on the list.
[00:16:21.658 --> 00:16:22.618]  And they won't tell me why.
[00:16:22.678 --> 00:16:23.838]  And the guy calls back a month later.
[00:16:24.219 --> 00:16:29.980]  Well, they say I collapsed, you know, after four days of not sleeping during the Tet Offensive.
[00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:34.361]  And the guy ended up sending me the paperwork he got from the feds and his lawyers later.
[00:16:34.381 --> 00:16:35.381]  And we had him as a guest.
[00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.181]  Forget his name.
[00:16:36.201 --> 00:16:36.722]  I could get him on.
[00:16:36.742 --> 00:16:38.182]  That was seven years ago, eight years ago now.
[00:16:40.513 --> 00:16:42.415]  And he can't own guns to this day!
[00:16:44.557 --> 00:16:45.037]  It's over!
[00:16:46.178 --> 00:16:50.802]  He collapsed after four days of not sleeping during the Tet Offensive, as a lot of people did.
[00:16:50.822 --> 00:16:56.067]  And when you go in, the Army, with those psychiatrists and psychologists, will just give you a designation.
[00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:07.056]  And they have given close to a million vets, since Vietnam, post-traumatic stress disorder designation.
[00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:12.469]  And I'm not saying that people don't get shocked, don't get messed up from war.
[00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:15.551]  But they shouldn't lose their right to own guns.
[00:17:16.651 --> 00:17:18.773]  And it doesn't mean they're going to go out and do something violent.
[00:17:19.153 --> 00:17:22.194]  It just means that they are emotionally wore out.
[00:17:24.235 --> 00:17:24.776]  But now,
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:30.505]  Just a few years ago, in one year alone, a hundred new psychological designations.
[00:17:30.945 --> 00:17:37.591]  If you believe there's a government corruption, they have several designations for that, saying you're insane, and you need to be drugged and lose your rights.
[00:17:38.132 --> 00:17:50.263]  So now you know why it's been in the news that when somebody goes to college, they say, oh, go see student aid, and you go see student aid, and they say, hey, go see this
[00:17:51.249 --> 00:17:57.151]  State psychologist, here's a department that's free, and if you get a designation, you're gonna get free tuition.
[00:17:58.071 --> 00:18:08.114]  I know a lot of people talk to me about this, and I've read about it in the news for over a decade, and you think it's free, and you go, and they go, yeah, you've got this, you've got that, now your school's free, how's that sound?
[00:18:08.374 --> 00:18:11.215]  You're like, man, this is really good deal, thank you!
[00:18:11.655 --> 00:18:15.856]  And you get your new designation, and you tell people about it, you get on some pills!
[00:18:16.977 --> 00:18:17.937]  You go to buy a gun,
[00:18:20.214 --> 00:18:23.116]  And they're already doing it without a law, you understand.
[00:18:24.217 --> 00:18:26.899]  Well, that's what the new system is.
[00:18:27.339 --> 00:18:46.674]  If they can't get you on welfare to get you in the system, or they can't get you in the military to take your liberties and freedoms and put you under admiralty under contract law, and if they can't get you on welfare, or they can't get you on probation, or they can't get you into their system, they're going to do it by giving you a psychological designation.
[00:18:48.303 --> 00:19:02.459]  And with 20% of the public, that's the new numbers have gone up from 15 to right around 20% of the American people on some type of mind-altering drug prescription, every one of them was given a psychological designation.
[00:19:03.764 --> 00:19:17.229]  And if you have a psychological designation, and again, the vast majority of the time, there's nothing even wrong with you, it's normal to get depressed, it's normal to get upset, it's normal, if you're not living your life right, you're not helping people, to be depressed.
[00:19:17.269 --> 00:19:21.291]  Listen, you feel like crap, because you're not helping people.
[00:19:22.031 --> 00:19:29.914]  You're not volunteering at soup kitchens, like I'm gonna be doing this Christmas, and I'm not saying I'm a good, special person, but that's, my soul needs that.
[00:19:31.235 --> 00:19:31.535]  Okay?
[00:19:33.044 --> 00:19:38.688]  You feel bad because your subconscious brain is mad at you for not visiting your father in the nursing home.
[00:19:40.849 --> 00:19:45.752]  You feel bad because you don't have courage and you need to take courage.
[00:19:47.273 --> 00:19:48.714]  You can get courage.
[00:19:49.215 --> 00:19:49.695]  It's in you.
[00:19:49.735 --> 00:19:50.896]  You have to reach down and get it.
[00:19:52.577 --> 00:19:54.018]  You don't need deadly drugs.
[00:19:54.038 --> 00:19:57.420]  Alright, when we get back, we'll tell ya, it is the literal end of the Second Amendment.
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.280]  No other way to put it.
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:19:59.041]  When we get back,
[00:20:02.288 --> 00:20:13.558]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.

[00:22:01.587 --> 00:22:03.628]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:13.174]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:22:13.614 --> 00:22:20.838]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:22:21.548 --> 00:22:27.054]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:23:00.917 --> 00:23:02.759]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:23:02.899 --> 00:23:08.085]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:23:08.265 --> 00:23:09.606]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:23:09.866 --> 00:23:18.035]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:23:18.275 --> 00:23:23.981]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:25.943]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:23:26.003 --> 00:23:28.146]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:23:28.286 --> 00:23:32.552]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:23:32.732 --> 00:23:34.895]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:23:34.955 --> 00:23:41.644]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio down.
[00:23:44.099 --> 00:23:45.981]  I want you to listen to me very carefully.
[00:23:46.081 --> 00:23:47.042]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:23:47.062 --> 00:23:47.562]  This is not hyperbole.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:18.822]  This is a federal database, just like the no-fly list, where it's secret.
[00:24:20.242 --> 00:24:30.207]  But you can't be taken off the list, where they can add anybody they want now, not just for misdemeanors, but for any psychological designation.
[00:24:30.527 --> 00:24:38.750]  Any designation with 20% of the country at least with psychological designations.
[00:24:39.030 --> 00:24:42.552]  20% of the country now on drugs, and then they say, oh,
[00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:49.259]  You're on drugs, you can't own a gun.
[00:24:50.179 --> 00:24:56.203]  By the way, we told police officers that when they passed the family violence, see how they keep adding things on?
[00:24:56.783 --> 00:25:04.108]  Oh, well if you beat your children with tire irons, or you stab your wife with a butcher knife, you can't own a gun.
[00:25:04.188 --> 00:25:05.249]  Well, that's reasonable.
[00:25:05.769 --> 00:25:07.670]  You shouldn't be able to own a gun if you're beating your wife.
[00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:11.973]  But the law actually stated that if any restraining order has been issued,
[00:25:13.439 --> 00:25:14.519]  That you can't own a gun.
[00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:19.521]  And tens of thousands of police officers, of course, most of them, snickered and giggled.
[00:25:19.561 --> 00:25:23.462]  I remember in 2000, I remember it was all very funny.
[00:25:23.482 --> 00:25:26.603]  Actually, a lot of cops were upset about it.
[00:25:26.643 --> 00:25:27.263]  They didn't believe us.
[00:25:28.123 --> 00:25:28.723]  But some didn't.
[00:25:30.344 --> 00:25:31.664]  And I remember them calling into the talk show.
[00:25:31.684 --> 00:25:32.724]  I remember hearing them on other shows.
[00:25:33.805 --> 00:25:35.785]  And they lost their peace officer's license.
[00:25:36.045 --> 00:25:36.406]  Boom!
[00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:37.186]  Gone.
[00:25:38.546 --> 00:25:38.846]  Gone.
[00:25:38.866 --> 00:25:39.967]  Your certificate, gone.
[00:25:40.367 --> 00:25:41.487]  Lost your job.
[00:25:43.357 --> 00:25:55.107]  Because you'd been in a divorce, and your wife, when she went to get the divorce, and this is standard, this is in most, more than half of the divorces, the woman gets a restraining order.
[00:25:55.927 --> 00:26:06.856]  Because then she takes control of the house, she takes control of the goods, and if she can just tell the judge, yes, we've screamed at each other, I'm scared of him.
[00:26:07.697 --> 00:26:12.241]  And who in a fight, who hasn't, even the most perfect relationship, hasn't yelled, hasn't screamed?
[00:26:13.121 --> 00:26:19.544]  My experience, not with my wife, but girlfriends in the past, is generally the women like to get their hands on you, and then you gotta hold them down.
[00:26:19.604 --> 00:26:21.625]  But the point is, it doesn't matter.
[00:26:27.048 --> 00:26:33.151]  If they go tell the judge, and that's all they do, that I'm scared, it doesn't matter if you've never touched her.
[00:26:34.452 --> 00:26:36.973]  Your peace officer's license is gone!
[00:26:37.513 --> 00:26:39.474]  Now, you thought that was bad.
[00:26:39.992 --> 00:26:44.755]  And the troops thought it was bad when Clinton, just by fiat, put 86,000 names on there.
[00:26:46.836 --> 00:26:49.278]  This is close to a million vets.
[00:26:50.999 --> 00:26:58.083]  This is all of them that ever were given PTSD or any other psychological designation, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:01.471 --> 00:27:04.893]  And they've been doing this since the 40s, using psychiatrists to label people.
[00:27:05.393 --> 00:27:30.745]  I mean, there were famous cases of aircraft, and there's been Discovery Channel and History Channel shows about it, even there on the Hitler Channel, where a B-17 part would be malfunctioning, 50 cals would be blowing up, throttles, sticks would be sticking, flaps would be having problems because of bed rigging and corruption in the factories, people would gripe, and they'd give whole groups, you know, oh, well, you've got a psychosis.
[00:27:31.294 --> 00:27:33.216]  And then later it came out that there were army documents.
[00:27:33.396 --> 00:27:37.099]  They were just giving that to people to say they were crazy so they wouldn't have to fix the aircraft.
[00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:38.240]  I mean, it's an old trick.
[00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:39.901]  The Soviets pioneered it in the 20s.
[00:27:40.802 --> 00:27:41.622]  The Germans did it.
[00:27:42.083 --> 00:27:44.565]  Well, this is the new tyranny of the psychiatrist.
[00:27:48.007 --> 00:27:49.569]  And this is how they get you into the system.
[00:27:50.569 --> 00:27:54.052]  Now, it's being called the Veterans Disarmament Act.
[00:27:54.773 --> 00:27:55.914]  That's not the name of the bill.
[00:27:55.934 --> 00:27:57.955]  That's what gun owners is giving it to get the word out.
[00:27:57.975 --> 00:27:58.796]  It's worse than that.
[00:28:00.563 --> 00:28:01.243]  It's always worse.
[00:28:02.164 --> 00:28:05.145]  It's the Veterans and Law Enforcement Disarmament Act.
[00:28:05.786 --> 00:28:09.328]  It is basically, I mean, this will disarm 20% of the public.
[00:28:10.288 --> 00:28:12.649]  And they're not going to stop with just not being able to buy them anymore.
[00:28:13.049 --> 00:28:16.411]  Then you're going to get raided, as they're already doing in Illinois, New York, and other areas.
[00:28:17.792 --> 00:28:18.952]  People are getting raided all the time.
[00:28:18.972 --> 00:28:20.873]  Before this is even law, they're doing it.
[00:28:20.913 --> 00:28:24.235]  Just saying, well, you've got a psychological designation, we interpret it.
[00:28:24.535 --> 00:28:27.117]  Remember the guy a few weeks ago, no criminal record, done nothing wrong?
[00:28:28.837 --> 00:28:29.658]  He was in Indiana.
[00:28:30.572 --> 00:28:32.873]  He had two guns and over a thousand rounds of ammo.
[00:28:32.893 --> 00:28:36.553]  They called a thousand rounds a stockpile of ammo.
[00:28:37.514 --> 00:28:40.334]  And he told his neighbors, look out, the economy is going to collapse.
[00:28:40.794 --> 00:28:42.415]  It's being orchestrated by the New World Order.
[00:28:42.535 --> 00:28:43.495]  I never could get a hold of the guy.
[00:28:43.595 --> 00:28:44.655]  Guaranteed he's a listener.
[00:28:45.235 --> 00:28:46.155]  It's all over the news.
[00:28:46.195 --> 00:28:49.336]  He was just reporting to his idiot neighbors that can't find the U.S.
[00:28:49.396 --> 00:28:49.756]  on a map.
[00:28:49.996 --> 00:28:50.896]  They called the police.
[00:28:51.297 --> 00:28:54.377]  They came and busted him and took his guns and called it an arsenal.
[00:28:56.898 --> 00:28:57.658]  That's what they do!
[00:28:58.968 --> 00:29:02.109]  And it said he thinks the government's orchestrating a financial collapse.
[00:29:02.169 --> 00:29:02.709]  It's illegal.
[00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:03.329]  Arrest him!
[00:29:07.771 --> 00:29:11.272]  So if you go up to PrisonPlanet.com you can link through and find this.
[00:29:11.332 --> 00:29:11.872]  It's HR 2640.
[00:29:11.952 --> 00:29:13.493]  Let me say that again.
[00:29:13.873 --> 00:29:14.993]  House Resolution 2640.
[00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:21.915]  When we get back I'm going to read this entire article by gun owners.
[00:29:21.955 --> 00:29:22.876]  I'm just going to walk through it.
[00:29:24.376 --> 00:29:24.896]  This is it!
[00:29:27.077 --> 00:29:27.217]  And
[00:29:29.048 --> 00:29:30.589]  Do you think they're gonna care, police?
[00:29:30.609 --> 00:29:33.810]  Because you got a PTSD when you got out from the first Gulf War?
[00:29:34.431 --> 00:29:37.752]  Or people who just became cops who had a tour in the first, second Gulf War?
[00:29:38.833 --> 00:29:42.295]  The other cops are just gonna turn their backs on you when you get, uh, lose your certificate.
[00:29:44.776 --> 00:29:45.476]  Just remember that.
[00:29:50.699 --> 00:29:51.599]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:53.700]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.601 --> 00:29:57.322]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.985 --> 00:30:05.246]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[00:30:05.506 --> 00:30:10.347]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:10.587 --> 00:30:11.928]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:12.108 --> 00:30:15.588]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Cal Bend Pure Soaps?

[00:32:01.165 --> 00:32:02.326]  I'm Dr. Bill Deagle, MD.
[00:32:02.346 --> 00:32:04.527]  I'm the Nutrimedical Report here on Genesis.
[00:32:04.847 --> 00:32:07.829]  Allicin, a natural antibiotic from Allomax Nutraceuticals U.S.
[00:32:07.889 --> 00:32:08.590]  is a real thing.
[00:32:08.650 --> 00:32:15.534]  This amazing molecule is a stabilized antimicrobial antipathogenic killer for fresh, never before available garlic.
[00:32:15.674 --> 00:32:20.938]  Allicin molecule is biologically active against all bacterial pathogens, viruses, fungi, parasites,
[00:32:21.098 --> 00:32:21.838]  We're good to go!
[00:32:47.924 --> 00:32:51.631]  Secure online ordering is available at Nutramedical.com or call 888-212-8871.
[00:32:51.651 --> 00:32:52.894]  That number again, 888-212-8871.
[00:32:52.914 --> 00:32:55.018]  The most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[00:33:25.291 --> 00:33:25.952]  Oh yeah!
[00:33:54.503 --> 00:33:59.444]  Welcome back, glad you joined us.
[00:34:02.985 --> 00:34:05.285]  Larry Pratt coming up in about 25 minutes.
[00:34:05.325 --> 00:34:13.527]  We're about to get back into what this Second Amendment killing psychological police state control grid is really going to do and read through the bill.
[00:34:15.147 --> 00:34:20.408]  Before I do that, I wanted to remind my listeners that they can get specials
[00:34:21.246 --> 00:34:29.588]  That nobody else can get by going to PrisonPlanet.com, looking on the right-hand side where most of our sponsors are, where it says Interfood.
[00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:31.949]  You'll see a little flashing banner that says Interfood.
[00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:34.210]  You click on there, you get 10% off.
[00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:37.451]  You buy in bulk, you get an additional 20% off.
[00:34:37.531 --> 00:34:38.731]  That's really a great deal.
[00:34:40.752 --> 00:34:47.814]  And I take Interfood about five days a week now, and it really cuts back on my cravings because if you eat junky food,
[00:34:49.213 --> 00:34:51.115]  Most foods have been debased of its minerals and vitamins.
[00:34:51.135 --> 00:34:52.737]  You're still hungry because you want the vitamins.
[00:34:53.177 --> 00:34:55.780]  So you need to eat more to get it out of a debased food product.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.182]  Well, not when you eat inner food, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:58.242 --> 00:35:11.296]  Balanced energy all day long, greater stamina, weight loss, 20 power-packed ingredients, greater mental clarity, reduced food cravings, healthy radiant skin, helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels, improve liver function, healthy blood sugar, immune system support, improve digestion,
[00:35:12.071 --> 00:35:14.972]  Detoxing effects, colon cleansing, this is the real deal.
[00:35:15.312 --> 00:35:20.394]  The highest quality green food out there at a great price, and they're patriots, and they're supporters of this show.
[00:35:20.454 --> 00:35:21.094]  You can't beat it.
[00:35:21.114 --> 00:35:22.555]  866-762-9238, 866-762-9238, or innerfood.com.
[00:35:22.575 --> 00:35:28.017]  And I also want to tell you about another fine sponsor in the information war.
[00:35:28.037 --> 00:35:29.097]  And that's Newswatch Magazine.
[00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:44.790]  Newswatch Magazine has been around since August of 1980.
[00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:48.391]  That's 27 years.
[00:35:49.912 --> 00:35:53.693]  Newswatch Magazine woke up members of my family that helped wake me up.
[00:35:54.593 --> 00:35:56.314]  It's based just south of Dallas.
[00:35:56.414 --> 00:35:59.174]  It is a glossy, Time Magazine-style magazine.
[00:35:59.975 --> 00:36:04.796]  And I'm telling you, David J. Smith is a true scholar of the New World Order.
[00:36:04.856 --> 00:36:07.917]  He knew about it back in the 50s when he went to college.
[00:36:09.097 --> 00:36:11.920]  And, uh, it's just a magazine you've got to get, and it's free!
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.141]  Twelve issues, free.
[00:36:13.522 --> 00:36:17.025]  The way they pay for it is there's some ads in the back for books and videos they've got that are excellent.
[00:36:17.306 --> 00:36:19.928]  So, you know, you get the magazine, be sure and support them.
[00:36:20.008 --> 00:36:21.910]  But it's just no hassles, no nothing.
[00:36:22.211 --> 00:36:24.873]  You call them, they get your address, they mail it to you.
[00:36:25.434 --> 00:36:25.734]  Boom.
[00:36:26.115 --> 00:36:26.435]  Done.
[00:36:26.996 --> 00:36:30.940]  If you haven't subscribed to it for free, and again, even if you
[00:36:33.368 --> 00:36:34.589]  Already know all about the New World Order.
[00:36:34.629 --> 00:36:35.409]  You don't know everything.
[00:36:35.509 --> 00:36:40.791]  And secondarily, get them and read them and then leave at the dental office, at work, at the hair salon, at church.
[00:36:41.692 --> 00:36:42.872]  That's how we're going to win this fight.
[00:36:42.992 --> 00:36:43.953]  One mind at a time, folks.
[00:36:43.973 --> 00:36:45.314]  And it's going to take you taking action.
[00:36:45.674 --> 00:36:47.595]  That's why we're starting to win, because you are taking action.
[00:36:47.615 --> 00:36:47.715]  1-800-516-8736.
[00:36:47.735 --> 00:36:47.835]  1-800-516-8736.
[00:36:47.855 --> 00:36:47.915]  1-800-516-8736.
[00:36:47.975 --> 00:36:51.636]  Or just write to them and tell them your name and where you want your free subscription mailed.
[00:36:51.656 --> 00:36:52.517]  That's a year's subscription.
[00:37:02.006 --> 00:37:02.366]  P.O.
[00:37:02.406 --> 00:37:17.197]  Box 36, Waxahachie, Texas 75168 or check them out online at NewsWatchMagazine.org NewsWatchMagazine.org or 1-800-516-8736 Fabulous folks!
[00:37:18.078 --> 00:37:22.241]  And I gotta put a plug in here for myself PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:37:24.287 --> 00:37:31.953]  All 16 of my films, Terror Storm, Final Cut, in super high quality, now on a content distribution network for super fast downloads and streaming downloads.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:33.681]  A bunch of different formats.
[00:37:33.941 --> 00:37:45.711]  Go there, burn them to disk, burn them to DVD all day long on any subject from vaccines to the police state to the economy to the pedophile rings that run the government to the United Nations agenda 21.
[00:37:45.791 --> 00:37:46.431]  It's all there.
[00:37:46.532 --> 00:37:56.800]  Hundreds and hundreds of topics from the weekly TV show, the weekly Sunday show we videotape, and the guests we videotape here in studio, and the eugenics reports, and my book, Paul Watson's book, and e-books.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:57.461]  Burn them to disk.
[00:37:57.501 --> 00:37:58.281]  Just get them out!
[00:37:58.682 --> 00:38:00.243]  It is a fulcrum of resistance.
[00:38:01.511 --> 00:38:04.492]  And we charge 15 cents a day so we can pay for the bandwidth and the webmasters.
[00:38:05.452 --> 00:38:06.172]  And that's what it does.
[00:38:06.252 --> 00:38:09.353]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv, get yourself a membership there today.
[00:38:09.373 --> 00:38:10.954]  I want to thank those that are members.
[00:38:10.974 --> 00:38:18.656]  You're call-to-old free to get any hard copies of my books, the books we carry, the DVDs we carry, the 9-11 Inside Job t-shirts, InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:38:18.676 --> 00:38:18.996]  Again, 888-253-3139.
[00:38:29.668 --> 00:38:32.170]  By the way, I've got a big announcement coming up in ten minutes, so stay with us.
[00:38:33.251 --> 00:38:34.351]  In the final segment of this hour.
[00:38:34.471 --> 00:38:35.212]  Big announcement.
[00:38:35.612 --> 00:38:37.473]  Stay with us for that.
[00:38:37.714 --> 00:38:40.455]  I wanted to do it earlier, but I haven't done it yet, because I've got to cover this.
[00:38:43.838 --> 00:38:44.178]  Okay.
[00:38:45.479 --> 00:38:45.759]  So.
[00:38:48.261 --> 00:38:51.843]  And mind you, the House already passed this, but in the session closed, so they're back.
[00:38:52.164 --> 00:38:55.506]  So they already passed the biggest gun control act since 1968.
[00:38:55.546 --> 00:38:55.906]  Really bigger.
[00:38:57.791 --> 00:39:00.472]  And then, they're back with it to try to fully pass it now.
[00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:03.214]  Urgent alert!
[00:39:03.394 --> 00:39:07.516]  Anti-Gonzalez trying to ram disarmament bill through Senate.
[00:39:08.096 --> 00:39:09.297]  Immediate action required.
[00:39:09.337 --> 00:39:11.778]  Again, they're calling it the Victim Disarmament Act.
[00:39:11.798 --> 00:39:13.279]  They're calling it the Veterans Disarmament Act.
[00:39:13.579 --> 00:39:14.259]  Folks, it's worse.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:19.182]  It's like when Patriots said, oh, this amnesty bill is really an amnesty.
[00:39:19.202 --> 00:39:19.822]  They're lying.
[00:39:19.842 --> 00:39:21.003]  And they said, no, the bill's secret.
[00:39:21.043 --> 00:39:23.284]  And when we got it, it was worse than amnesty.
[00:39:24.458 --> 00:39:30.000]  It was a pardon, a presidential, congressional pardon for 30 million illegal aliens, aggravated felons.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:30.760]  I mean, it was in there.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.040]  It said aggravated felons.
[00:39:34.361 --> 00:39:37.922]  MS-13, this is worse than what gun owners are saying.
[00:39:37.962 --> 00:39:38.802]  I've read the bill now.
[00:39:39.923 --> 00:39:40.523]  The new version.
[00:39:42.703 --> 00:39:44.644]  Gun owners of America, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:39:47.401 --> 00:39:57.033]  You'd think that when rabid anti-gun legislators, like Charles Schum, Representative Carolyn McCarthy, joined together to pass anti-gun legislation, it would raise a few red flags.
[00:39:57.774 --> 00:40:01.839]  But these two New York Democrats are currently planning to roll over gun owners with H.R.
[00:40:01.859 --> 00:40:06.045]  2640 legislation, which would bar you from owning guns if...
[00:40:08.351 --> 00:40:15.355]  And they're doing this from that black op they pulled up there in Virginia Tech in that victim disarmament zone, no guns allowed, so nobody could protect themselves.
[00:40:15.795 --> 00:40:18.756]  And the cops were told to stand down by the feds for more than three hours.
[00:40:21.137 --> 00:40:27.321]  Again, you will be banned from owning guns if you are a battle-scarred veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:40:29.422 --> 00:40:31.743]  As a kid, you were diagnosed with ADHD.
[00:40:32.083 --> 00:40:33.063]  Yeah, it bans you.
[00:40:33.704 --> 00:40:34.104]  Period.
[00:40:34.944 --> 00:40:36.085]  ADHD, all of it.
[00:40:36.545 --> 00:40:37.906]  Post-traumatic stress disorder.
[00:40:38.527 --> 00:40:47.584]  Not to mention the fact that your ailing grandfather could have his entire gun collection seized based only on a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, and there goes the family inheritance.
[00:40:50.461 --> 00:40:52.983]  They're doing that in Chicago right now and surrounding areas.
[00:40:53.343 --> 00:40:56.225]  Gun owners have been desperately fighting this bill for several months.
[00:40:56.605 --> 00:41:05.051]  You'll remember that it passed in the House with an unrecorded voice vote in June and was later passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee also without a recorded vote.
[00:41:05.291 --> 00:41:06.972]  I know Paul Watson's writing an article.
[00:41:06.992 --> 00:41:08.013]  I hope he adds.
[00:41:08.033 --> 00:41:11.075]  I hope he goes back to how they added the amendment.
[00:41:11.815 --> 00:41:14.377]  First they get the federal control, the background check.
[00:41:15.191 --> 00:41:21.216]  Then they fool everybody and go, oh, we'll make an incident on a five day waiting period, but just let us stop wife beaters.
[00:41:21.777 --> 00:41:23.238]  And again, it wasn't wife beaters.
[00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:30.464]  And I know that in that first year, more than 10,000 cops alone lost their peace officers license.
[00:41:30.824 --> 00:41:32.506]  Again, this is hard core folks.
[00:41:32.526 --> 00:41:34.507]  This is going to make that look pale.
[00:41:36.249 --> 00:41:38.331]  By the way, you're a cop listing right now and you have PTSD, baby.
[00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:44.259]  You're gonna get the message after this passes within six months that your job's gone.
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:45.340]  Just watch.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.361]  Just watch!
[00:41:50.104 --> 00:41:52.466]  Gun owners have been desperately fighting this bill for several months.
[00:41:52.486 --> 00:42:01.513]  You'll remember that it passed in the House and was an unrecorded voice vote in June and was later passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee also without a recorded voice vote.
[00:42:03.735 --> 00:42:04.476]  Suddenly I can't talk.
[00:42:04.516 --> 00:42:05.156]  I'm so stunned.
[00:42:05.437 --> 00:42:08.239]  Senator Schumer, an un-American dual citizen,
[00:42:09.219 --> 00:42:20.986]  Is pushing hard to pass the legislation, dubbed the Veteran Disarmament Act, so he is circulating an agreement which would waive the Senate rules in order to bring up and pass the bill.
[00:42:21.006 --> 00:42:22.506]  So they're playing tricks.
[00:42:23.047 --> 00:42:26.809]  The agreement could come about in the next few hours or the next couple days.
[00:42:27.369 --> 00:42:37.655]  This agreement is extremely diabolical as it would eliminate the ability of pro-gun senators to offer amendments which would clean up the legislation and would grease the skids for immediate passage.
[00:42:39.921 --> 00:42:42.882]  Now, I don't even know why gun owners isn't just saying, no new thing.
[00:42:43.263 --> 00:42:50.926]  Look, if somebody's been deemed by a court incompetent and mentally ill, you know, out of their gourd, insane, you can't own a gun.
[00:42:51.206 --> 00:42:56.829]  They're saying, oh, but with this guy at Virginia, that had happened and he could still buy a gun.
[00:42:56.889 --> 00:42:58.570]  See, it's all going into the federal database.
[00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:01.811]  Hey, I need to be able to have guns to protect myself.
[00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:03.472]  That guy's going to get a gun regardless.
[00:43:06.064 --> 00:43:07.024]  But there is good news.
[00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:10.445]  In order for Schumer's agreement to prevail, he must get unanimous consent.
[00:43:10.465 --> 00:43:13.105]  This means just one single vote can block it.
[00:43:13.565 --> 00:43:13.886]  Action!
[00:43:14.326 --> 00:43:15.626]  Please contact two U.S.
[00:43:15.646 --> 00:43:21.487]  Senators right now and urge them to object to Senator Chuck Schumer, who is a traitor and a treasonous piece of filth.
[00:43:22.067 --> 00:43:23.767]  It is treason to come and say, ban our guns.
[00:43:24.028 --> 00:43:26.428]  It is treason to sell us out of the North American Union.
[00:43:26.688 --> 00:43:27.908]  These are the real traitors.
[00:43:29.168 --> 00:43:31.609]  Ending the country, ending the Bill of Rights is treason.
[00:43:32.705 --> 00:43:34.126]  By the way, we almost had a revolution.
[00:43:34.146 --> 00:43:38.109]  A few years after the country got set up, they tried to get rid of the Bill of Rights, and people marched on Washington.
[00:43:38.149 --> 00:43:41.191]  So, people want jurisprudence and precedent.
[00:43:41.231 --> 00:43:41.571]  There it is.
[00:43:41.611 --> 00:43:42.832]  I'm not saying do that now.
[00:43:43.113 --> 00:43:44.954]  My point is, he really is a treasonous traitor.
[00:43:45.394 --> 00:43:49.057]  But he's not really a traitor or treasonous because he's not even really a U.S.
[00:43:49.097 --> 00:43:49.737]  citizen, so.
[00:43:51.058 --> 00:43:53.800]  Unanimous consent agreement to steamroll H.R.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.842]  2640, the McCarthy anti-gun bill.
[00:44:03.248 --> 00:44:09.051]  You can use the pre-written message below and send it as an email by visiting GOA Legislative Action Center.
[00:44:10.231 --> 00:44:20.215]  Dear Senator, currently anti-gun zealot Chuck Schumer is trying to get unanimous consent to steamroll the Senate in connection with Carolyn McCarthy's anti-gun bill H.R.
[00:44:20.235 --> 00:44:20.215]  2640.
[00:44:20.816 --> 00:44:23.397]  If this bill is passed, an American will be barred from owning guns.
[00:44:23.517 --> 00:44:24.657]  If he is a U.S.
[00:44:24.677 --> 00:44:29.539]  veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or several hundred other designations, I would add.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:31.020]  I've read the bill.
[00:44:32.043 --> 00:44:38.668]  As a kid he was diagnosed with ADHD in connection with the ID program, as it's called.
[00:44:39.909 --> 00:44:51.717]  Not to mention the fact that an ailing grandfather could have his entire gun collection seized based only on a diagnosis of Alzheimer's from a Medicare home health provider, and there goes the entire family inheritance.
[00:44:53.078 --> 00:44:57.300]  Gun owners don't support this legislation, better known as the Veterans Disarmament Act.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:09.724]  The military order of the Purple Heart is opposed to it, having stated on June 18th of this year that for the first time the legislation enacted would statutorily impose a lifetime gun ban on battle-scarred veterans.
[00:45:10.785 --> 00:45:16.407]  Please place a hold on the McCarthy Bill and object to any unanimous consent agreement to discharge the bill.
[00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:19.328]  And the reason there's so much danger is it's a pork barrel bill.
[00:45:19.428 --> 00:45:20.168]  It's a rider.
[00:45:20.649 --> 00:45:21.669]  And they want this passed.
[00:45:22.533 --> 00:45:24.093]  Now listen to me and listen good!
[00:45:26.673 --> 00:45:29.995]  I didn't think to pull up the Senate phone numbers online.
[00:45:30.096 --> 00:45:30.696]  You can do it.
[00:45:30.736 --> 00:45:32.497]  Just type in Senate phone numbers.
[00:45:32.577 --> 00:45:33.518]  US Senate phone numbers.
[00:45:34.038 --> 00:45:35.719]  If you don't have a computer, practice.
[00:45:35.779 --> 00:45:40.663]  I can get the number for you, but why don't you practice not being spoon-fed everything like a baby bird.
[00:45:41.063 --> 00:45:44.626]  Why don't you fly out of the nest for yourself and go to Google.
[00:45:44.906 --> 00:45:46.187]  I don't care if you don't have a computer.
[00:45:46.227 --> 00:45:48.929]  Go to the library and say, I need help getting on a computer.
[00:45:48.989 --> 00:45:50.129]  I want to learn how to use it.
[00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.711]  Give me the Senate phone number.
[00:45:52.031 --> 00:45:53.092]  Call information.
[00:45:54.412 --> 00:45:55.073]  Take a step.
[00:45:55.746 --> 00:45:56.947]  I'll give you the number, fine.
[00:45:56.987 --> 00:45:57.547]  I'll dig it up.
[00:45:57.607 --> 00:45:58.408]  I just forgot to get it.
[00:46:00.389 --> 00:46:01.290]  Just please!
[00:46:03.592 --> 00:46:08.415]  Don't waste your time calling that sniveling, demon-possessed pig Chuckie Schumer.
[00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:09.236]  I mean, just look at him!
[00:46:09.276 --> 00:46:11.638]  He looks like a commissar or something, right?
[00:46:11.658 --> 00:46:12.698]  Well, I guess that's what he is.
[00:46:13.219 --> 00:46:14.660]  And our Homeland Security head is...
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.682]  And the new Attorney General is, and we're surrounded.
[00:46:17.702 --> 00:46:24.007]  Homeland Security hired Marcus Wolfe, the former head of the SCSI, the former head of the KGB is a consultant for Homeland Security.
[00:46:24.568 --> 00:46:28.030]  Again, you cannot make this stuff up.
[00:46:28.711 --> 00:46:30.192]  It is so off the charts.
[00:46:30.272 --> 00:46:32.174]  It is so la-la land.
[00:46:32.254 --> 00:46:35.377]  It is so huge.
[00:46:37.919 --> 00:46:38.579]  And it's crazy.
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.603]  People say, well, why are there Nazis and grandsons of top Nazis in the government?
[00:46:42.643 --> 00:46:42.983]  Why are there
[00:46:44.255 --> 00:46:48.620]  You know, Madeleine Albright's big commissary have killed over a million people.
[00:46:49.241 --> 00:46:50.082]  Mainstream news.
[00:46:51.363 --> 00:46:56.429]  Again, they get fascists, they get communists, they get, I mean, just anybody.
[00:46:56.690 --> 00:46:58.151]  They come from these sick families.
[00:46:58.872 --> 00:46:59.693]  I know you don't believe me.
[00:46:59.713 --> 00:47:02.937]  Some new listeners, just type in Trotskyites in the White House.
[00:47:03.516 --> 00:47:11.499]  And you'll find out the neocons ran the 4th Communist International in the 50's and decided to then pose as conservatives and take over the Republican Party.
[00:47:11.899 --> 00:47:13.939]  It's William Crystal's father in all of them.
[00:47:14.119 --> 00:47:18.501]  There was an article yesterday in the mainstream news about this top neocon that visits with Bush every week.
[00:47:19.761 --> 00:47:20.221]  Where's he?
[00:47:20.241 --> 00:47:20.962]  Let me find that.
[00:47:20.982 --> 00:47:21.842]  I actually mentioned that.
[00:47:22.582 --> 00:47:23.302]  Why should I mention?
[00:47:23.342 --> 00:47:24.103]  I forget his name.
[00:47:24.143 --> 00:47:24.883]  It's hard to pronounce.
[00:47:29.938 --> 00:47:32.479]  Pud Horowitz, the little demon on Bush's shoulder.
[00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:35.020]  But that isn't the mainstream one, that's a Curtain Emo.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.101]  Sorry, it's not a think process.
[00:47:38.781 --> 00:47:40.122]  That was a mainstream article about him.
[00:47:40.462 --> 00:47:47.045]  The point is, is that they're all sons, grandsons of top commissariats out of Russia?
[00:47:47.585 --> 00:47:52.787]  I mean, folks, these are actually the grandsons of people that led the Red Terror.
[00:47:56.528 --> 00:47:58.349]  Sixty million killed.
[00:48:00.646 --> 00:48:02.128]  And they run everything!
[00:48:02.148 --> 00:48:09.997]  I mean, do you realize that if they get our guns, they're gonna do what they did in Russia?
[00:48:10.197 --> 00:48:11.739]  I'm not joking with you!
[00:48:14.312 --> 00:48:15.433]  I'm begging you, police.
[00:48:15.533 --> 00:48:18.575]  I'm begging FBI who listen to this show and make jokes about everything.
[00:48:19.216 --> 00:48:20.597]  Just go Google search it.
[00:48:20.617 --> 00:48:23.459]  I know you know you're under a police state, so you're scared to do it.
[00:48:23.499 --> 00:48:24.840]  See, I'll talk to cops.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.961]  They'll go, I don't want to search that.
[00:48:26.001 --> 00:48:26.782]  I know they're watching.
[00:48:27.702 --> 00:48:28.423]  But I'm a cook.
[00:48:28.503 --> 00:48:30.064]  You know they're watching, but I'm a cook.
[00:48:31.445 --> 00:48:34.548]  Or people on the street will say, Alex, you're paranoid.
[00:48:34.568 --> 00:48:35.248]  You're scared.
[00:48:35.268 --> 00:48:36.929]  And they'll come over and talk.
[00:48:36.989 --> 00:48:38.110]  Well, I don't want anybody to hear me.
[00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.551]  They might.
[00:48:38.611 --> 00:48:39.732]  And I go, oh, you're scared?
[00:48:39.992 --> 00:48:41.453]  But what I'm saying doesn't exist.
[00:48:44.022 --> 00:48:47.986]  I'm begging you, I'm begging you if you're in the government, please research these people.
[00:48:48.366 --> 00:48:50.488]  I know it sounds nuts, it's true!
[00:48:51.569 --> 00:48:52.249]  It's true!
[00:48:55.532 --> 00:49:02.158]  And they write memos about how torturing children is okay, and how they can have absolute dictatorship and how they're above the law.
[00:49:02.238 --> 00:49:07.002]  I mean, these people don't play games, folks.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:17.067]  And you've got all these drunk, fat, happy, entertained to death zombie Americans who don't know which end is up and they're just like lambs to the slaughter.
[00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.931]  You better read Alexander Schultz and Eason.
[00:49:21.951 --> 00:49:25.615]  I want to play this audio clip for the next subject I'm about to get into right now.
[00:49:26.836 --> 00:49:29.718]  This won a German film festival last year.
[00:49:30.399 --> 00:49:32.541]  This type of stuff is everywhere now in the media.
[00:49:32.621 --> 00:49:35.744]  This shows humans as demons that go around
[00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:43.203]  Defecating all over the planet, and destroying everything, and that we must die, and that going to space is evil.
[00:49:43.603 --> 00:49:47.325]  This is what they're showing in public schools all over the world right now.
[00:49:47.425 --> 00:49:48.445]  This is the endgame.
[00:49:48.465 --> 00:49:48.965]  Here it is.
[00:49:49.846 --> 00:49:53.867]  Our Earth.
[00:49:54.268 --> 00:49:56.369]  Healthy, strong, and full of life.
[00:49:56.429 --> 00:49:56.869]  But wait!
[00:49:57.349 --> 00:49:58.429]  What's that you've got there?
[00:49:59.630 --> 00:50:01.891]  It looks like you've got a case of the humans!
[00:50:02.791 --> 00:50:06.273]  To be a healthy Earth, all of your elements must be in equilibrium.
[00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:13.390]  However, these parasites slaughter all other forms of life.
[00:50:16.611 --> 00:50:18.252]  Guzzle your natural resources.
[00:50:21.713 --> 00:50:28.115]  And poison your atmosphere.
[00:50:28.235 --> 00:50:30.416]  Once contracted, humans act quickly.
[00:50:30.816 --> 00:50:35.838]  They multiply over 300,000 a day, consuming anything that crosses their path.
[00:50:41.079 --> 00:50:42.740]  Earth is just the start.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:45.082]  Who knows what's next?
[00:50:48.384 --> 00:50:51.265]  It's a hundred times more evil and wicked at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:51.285 --> 00:50:54.907]  You can watch it right now in the article Paul Watson has just written about it.
[00:50:55.388 --> 00:50:57.349]  If humans are a virus, then what is the endgame?
[00:50:57.369 --> 00:50:57.889]  Stay with us.
[00:50:57.929 --> 00:50:58.830]  We'll come back and cover it.
[00:51:03.721 --> 00:51:06.906]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:07.246 --> 00:51:09.189]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:09.570 --> 00:51:17.201]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:17.890 --> 00:51:24.933]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:25.333 --> 00:51:36.758]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.078 --> 00:51:40.720]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:43.001]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:47.143]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:02.281]  Terrorism!

[00:52:10.563 --> 00:52:13.024]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:13.404 --> 00:52:19.286]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was
[00:52:19.326 --> 00:52:27.971]  This video was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:52:28.012 --> 00:52:28.352]  government.

[00:52:30.693 --> 00:52:36.617]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:52:36.737 --> 00:52:41.180]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:53:00.228 --> 00:53:01.269]  Hey, Jack Blood here.
[00:53:01.509 --> 00:53:07.495]  I think that if we could see the germs' potential biohazards all around us in our daily surroundings, we would turn into Howard Hughes.
[00:53:07.796 --> 00:53:12.000]  We try not to think about it primarily because we might think there's nothing we can do about it.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:13.061]  Not so fast.
[00:53:13.141 --> 00:53:14.422]  Now there is a solution.
[00:53:14.603 --> 00:53:18.947]  I'm talking about Hazurid Complete Protection Kit, available now at Hazurid.com.
[00:53:19.087 --> 00:53:28.571]  This is the single solution that is tame enough to safely conquer everyday household and business cleaning chores, yet strong enough to decontaminate biological hazards.
[00:53:28.771 --> 00:53:33.293]  Hazurid fights infectious disease and unsurpassed odor, mold, and allergens.

[00:53:57.889 --> 00:53:58.950]  Tell them Jack Blood sent you.
[00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:06.536]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:07.197 --> 00:54:09.459]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.675]  John, I forgot to tell you out there.
[00:54:12.695 --> 00:54:13.896]  Go ahead and get Pratt on.
[00:54:13.916 --> 00:54:14.636]  Let's go ahead and line him up.
[00:54:14.656 --> 00:54:15.957]  I want to start with him immediately.
[00:54:15.977 --> 00:54:17.958]  In five minutes when we start the next hour.
[00:54:18.038 --> 00:54:18.438]  Thank you.
[00:54:18.918 --> 00:54:21.820]  Then Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us on the economic front.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.821]  Coming up the last 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:54:23.861 --> 00:54:27.123]  Then third hour open phones and all the other news I haven't gotten to yet.
[00:54:30.444 --> 00:54:36.888]  Again, urgent anti-gun zealots trying to ram Disarmament Veterans and Police Disarmament Act through the Senate right now.
[00:54:38.115 --> 00:54:41.157]  Even mainline veterans groups are saying this is disarmament of the veterans.
[00:54:41.177 --> 00:54:41.697]  Just wait!
[00:54:42.498 --> 00:54:47.080]  In a way, it'll just wake people up if they pass it, but this is what they're trying to do.
[00:54:48.701 --> 00:54:55.785]  Alright, Paul Watson has got a big article up right now on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:57.466]  It's also on InfoWars.com.
[00:54:58.787 --> 00:55:01.288]  If humans are a virus, then what is the endgame?
[00:55:01.883 --> 00:55:05.726]  Global warming cult fronts as camouflage for depopulation agenda.
[00:55:06.086 --> 00:55:10.389]  This is the most important message that we can get out to anyone out there.
[00:55:10.530 --> 00:55:11.330]  This is the key.
[00:55:11.891 --> 00:55:13.672]  This is what we've got to get out to everyone.
[00:55:15.053 --> 00:55:16.294]  This is what Endgame covers.
[00:55:16.414 --> 00:55:28.283]  And suddenly, it's hundreds of news articles the last month, TV shows, programs, cartoons, children's cartoons, saying we've got to get rid of humans, they're a cancer, they're killing the earth, we've got to get rid of them.
[00:55:28.643 --> 00:55:31.045]  This is the next phase of eugenics.
[00:55:32.299 --> 00:55:34.120]  And they're pushing it right out in the open.
[00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.681]  Humans are not a disease.
[00:55:35.701 --> 00:55:36.581]  They're not a cancer.
[00:55:36.621 --> 00:55:38.502]  Some of these technologies are very dangerous.
[00:55:38.942 --> 00:55:45.906]  And the real technologies that are causing problems, like open cross-species genetic engineering, is a cancer.
[00:55:46.766 --> 00:55:48.147]  But the elite are doing that.
[00:55:48.567 --> 00:55:53.950]  No, no, this is about your carbon footprint, globally taxing you, one-child policies to control you.
[00:55:54.010 --> 00:55:55.591]  It's a good article Paul has written.
[00:55:56.357 --> 00:55:57.317]  But here's the twist.
[00:55:57.477 --> 00:56:02.339]  There are two new in-game trailers we just launched today.
[00:56:03.719 --> 00:56:05.220]  Two new sneak peeks.
[00:56:06.620 --> 00:56:07.820]  A minute and a half a piece.
[00:56:08.181 --> 00:56:09.281]  Wait, I forget how long these are.
[00:56:09.321 --> 00:56:09.821]  It'll show me.
[00:56:11.682 --> 00:56:12.682]  Oh, they're each a minute long.
[00:56:13.122 --> 00:56:17.403]  We've got the five minute trailer up there that we put up a few weeks ago that's gotten close to 100,000 views.
[00:56:17.863 --> 00:56:19.404]  And we just launched today two
[00:56:20.931 --> 00:56:25.873]  Minute-long trailers from other scenes in the film and next week.
[00:56:25.893 --> 00:56:32.777]  We're going to put out two more trailers, and then that's it but Those are your sneak peeks.
[00:56:32.937 --> 00:56:39.700]  They're up there right now, but also ask you to for win those on YouTube You want to email out the YouTubes?
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:46.623]  But if you've got a good internet connection you can watch these in the quality that InfoWars.net viewers get to see films like
[00:56:47.446 --> 00:56:50.828]  Terror Storm Final Cut and Endgame when it comes out later next month.
[00:56:52.749 --> 00:56:54.510]  I mean, it is TV quality.
[00:56:54.610 --> 00:57:04.376]  I want you to go read the article Paul's done and it has links to whatistheendgame.com, endgamethemovie.com.
[00:57:05.297 --> 00:57:08.119]  There are links to the new sites.
[00:57:09.935 --> 00:57:12.916]  EndgameTheMovie.com or what is the Endgame.
[00:57:12.936 --> 00:57:18.158]  You can go there and you can watch all of the trailers.
[00:57:20.359 --> 00:57:22.279]  You can see the new trailers.
[00:57:22.819 --> 00:57:31.662]  We've got an Endgame in the news, a bunch of video clips and news reports where they say get rid of the population, get rid of everybody, just in their own words.
[00:57:31.702 --> 00:57:33.543]  We call it Endgame News is there.
[00:57:34.303 --> 00:57:36.224]  Aaron, in the next few weeks,
[00:57:37.279 --> 00:57:39.621]  He's going to create a whole history section.
[00:57:40.822 --> 00:57:45.727]  He's been working on it with a timeline and documents and kind of a bibliography for the film.
[00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:52.273]  But the individual that built this website is Kurt Nemo.
[00:57:53.454 --> 00:57:55.036]  And we have hired Kurt Nemo.
[00:57:55.076 --> 00:57:56.037]  He's part of the team.
[00:57:56.097 --> 00:57:57.078]  I hired him about a month ago.
[00:57:57.890 --> 00:58:06.714]  He's going to be launching next week, we'll announce it then, a new news website that's going to have Kurt's own flair and his personality and his unique perspective.
[00:58:06.855 --> 00:58:08.375]  It's close to mine, but not exactly the same.
[00:58:08.956 --> 00:58:10.496]  A very intelligent individual.
[00:58:10.536 --> 00:58:12.417]  We've been scanning for people to join the team.
[00:58:12.757 --> 00:58:17.360]  Frankly, very few, I think, get the full spectrum and have the general knowledge.
[00:58:19.081 --> 00:58:21.862]  So we've got Kurt Nimmo on the team.
[00:58:21.882 --> 00:58:25.804]  He'll be running a new flagship attack website going after the New World Order.
[00:58:26.625 --> 00:58:27.645]  Out of our ship works.
[00:58:28.766 --> 00:58:35.067]  And he also did the Endgame website and he's been working with Aaron Dykes who did the trailers with Rob Jacobson.
[00:58:35.547 --> 00:58:37.748]  We'll be right back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:41.048 --> 00:58:45.289]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:55.132 --> 00:58:55.792]  Big Brother.
[00:58:56.453 --> 00:58:57.533]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:58.214 --> 00:58:59.354]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.015 --> 00:59:00.795]  You want answers?
[00:59:01.575 --> 00:59:02.556]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.116 --> 00:59:06.698]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.299 --> 00:59:11.461]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.444 --> 00:59:19.385]  I read the bill in the last Congress.
[00:59:19.465 --> 00:59:20.546]  I read it this Congress.
[00:59:21.426 --> 00:59:22.567]  It's worse this time.
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:28.683]  It will ban anyone who ever had ADHD or hundreds of other psychological designations.
[00:59:29.643 --> 00:59:34.926]  Close to a million vets in the last 40 years that have been given post-traumatic stress disorder designations.
[00:59:34.966 --> 00:59:36.227]  They hand them out like hotcakes.
[00:59:36.727 --> 00:59:38.087]  Will be banned from owning guns.
[00:59:38.168 --> 00:59:39.068]  Clinton already did it to 86,000 vets.
[00:59:42.216 --> 00:59:49.421]  And Larry Pratt from Gun Owners of America joins us right now, ladies and gentlemen, on the website gunowners.org.
[00:59:49.942 --> 00:59:51.463]  Go to the legislative alert system.
[00:59:51.623 --> 01:00:00.569]  We are on the verge of Chuckie Schumer being able to pass this, one senator standing in their way, but this is a red-level alert.
[01:00:01.289 --> 01:00:03.731]  Larry Pratt, do you agree with that statement that this is a red-level alert?
[01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:08.554]  Oh, that's absolutely on the money.
[01:00:09.195 --> 01:00:10.416]  This is something that
[01:00:11.488 --> 01:00:16.949]  If it hadn't been for the diligence of Senator Coburn right now, this thing would have gone on its way.
[01:00:16.969 --> 01:00:20.590]  Exactly, in fact, explain that.
[01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:23.690]  They almost passed this, but he just blocked them.
[01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:27.611]  Well, there's two versions of the bill in the Senate right now.
[01:00:28.151 --> 01:00:29.471]  One came over from the House.
[01:00:29.971 --> 01:00:35.812]  That was passed without the voice vote, with a voice vote, no recorded vote, no debate.
[01:00:36.352 --> 01:00:40.753]  Carol McCarthy, representative of Long Island, New York, that's her bill.
[01:00:41.682 --> 01:00:44.883]  And the Senate, Senator Leahy, introduced his own bill.
[01:00:45.783 --> 01:00:48.943]  And that bill has been heard in the Judiciary Committee.
[01:00:49.663 --> 01:00:55.905]  And there's been a turf battle over a provision that wasn't in the McCarthy bill between Leahy and Kennedy.
[01:00:56.545 --> 01:01:00.025]  And that was helping, because until they resolved it, the bill wasn't going to go anywhere.
[01:01:00.545 --> 01:01:05.426]  So Schumer decided, nuts with them, he's going to take the McCarthy bill and move it.
[01:01:06.446 --> 01:01:10.087]  And he was seeking to get unanimous consent, just like they had in the House.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:15.744]  But this time, we had somebody that was able to be there in time to say, I object.
[01:01:16.004 --> 01:01:20.627]  And it hasn't quite happened yet, but that's what's in store for us this afternoon.
[01:01:20.647 --> 01:01:31.915]  At some point, they're going to force Coburn to show whether he can come up with 40 people to go with him on stopping the bill.
[01:01:32.035 --> 01:01:38.119]  And the way, the only way right now he can do it is through some killer amendments, because the bill itself
[01:01:38.889 --> 01:01:48.595]  Is viewed by almost everybody in the whole Congress as, oh, this is okay because both the Brady campaign and the NRA support it, so what's your problem?
[01:01:49.176 --> 01:01:58.542]  Well, the amendments themselves show what the problem is, and if they pass, they got the bill, and if they pass, they'll probably just pull the bill down.
[01:01:58.602 --> 01:02:02.585]  Now, Larry, I know you're a classy guy, but we have to admit who the problem is.
[01:02:02.745 --> 01:02:05.587]  I read two years ago, in that federal court case in D.C.,
[01:02:06.678 --> 01:02:09.246]  Where the NRA argued that all guns should be registered.
[01:02:09.266 --> 01:02:10.169]  I read it.
[01:02:10.450 --> 01:02:10.691]  On air.
[01:02:11.537 --> 01:02:18.261]  We know they push for the 68 Gun Control Act, so did Charlton Heston, who I've interviewed, but I have the TV clips where they used him.
[01:02:18.281 --> 01:02:20.602]  Oh, let's stop criminals from having guns.
[01:02:21.163 --> 01:02:24.445]  Again, enemies close, friends close, enemies closer.
[01:02:24.465 --> 01:02:27.907]  I mean, let's just admit it, the NRA is infiltrated and controlled.
[01:02:28.127 --> 01:02:37.112]  When we were about to beat gun bills in Texas in 99, they came out and attacked us because we didn't want to ban people 18 and under from being able to go hunting with their grandfathers.
[01:02:37.993 --> 01:02:40.235]  I mean, look, the NRA is an enemy organization.
[01:02:40.295 --> 01:02:43.658]  Not their members, but let's just face it, it's a Judas goat.
[01:02:44.238 --> 01:02:48.302]  The only disagreement I would have is that I think they've always been this way.
[01:02:48.342 --> 01:02:51.985]  They were set up as a chartered organization by Congress.
[01:02:52.526 --> 01:03:01.714]  Union officers wanted to improve the marksmanship of Northern soldiers following the War of Lincoln's Aggression, and as a result, we got
[01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:12.075]  Uh, the NRA set up and Franklin Orth, who was their president in 68, said, we've always been for reasonable, workable gun control legislation.
[01:03:12.595 --> 01:03:16.777]  So, they haven't really changed since their very beginning.
[01:03:16.817 --> 01:03:20.059]  They've looked at themselves as a handmaiden of the government.
[01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:25.733]  Not as an adversary to the government, which was the whole idea that the founders had.
[01:03:26.234 --> 01:03:31.899]  When they set up the government, they knew that they were dealing with fire, and they wanted to have power divided.
[01:03:32.019 --> 01:03:32.499]  Exactly.
[01:03:32.559 --> 01:03:38.144]  The only way to disarm the American people is to control the organization that leads them.
[01:03:38.745 --> 01:03:41.127]  Stay there, Larry Pratt, Governors of America.
[01:03:41.527 --> 01:03:45.590]  One more segment with him to break down this Second Amendment-killing bill.
[01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:46.251]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:52.498 --> 01:03:53.560]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.664]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:03:56.925 --> 01:04:01.091]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:01.511 --> 01:04:02.312]  So what do you do?
[01:04:02.332 --> 01:04:07.240]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:09.841]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:04:10.321 --> 01:04:25.026]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:25.066 --> 01:04:32.109]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:04:32.469 --> 01:04:36.891]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[01:04:53.749 --> 01:04:59.237]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:04:59.598 --> 01:05:07.249]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:07.927 --> 01:05:15.049]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:15.369 --> 01:05:26.792]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:27.112 --> 01:05:30.653]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:31.053 --> 01:05:33.054]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:33.334 --> 01:05:37.175]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.021]  Hemp, the superfood for you and your family.
[01:05:53.422 --> 01:05:56.663]  Hemp has nutritional values that far exceed any known plant.
[01:05:57.176 --> 01:05:57.396]  Hemp.
[01:05:57.837 --> 01:06:00.579]  Used for food, clothing, and shelter since time began.
[01:06:00.959 --> 01:06:01.199]  Hemp.
[01:06:01.579 --> 01:06:08.064]  This God-given food source is controlled by your government, making it not legal to grow for American people and farmers, but legal to import.
[01:06:08.385 --> 01:06:11.647]  Our founding fathers grew hemp because they knew of the benefits it offered.
[01:06:11.927 --> 01:06:15.350]  The protein powders, seeds, and oil are available through hempusa.com.
[01:06:15.370 --> 01:06:15.570]  I think so.
[01:06:34.145 --> 01:06:40.371]  Call today at 908-691-2608 and see what the powder, seeds, and oil can do for you.

[01:06:51.921 --> 01:06:57.966]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:58.546 --> 01:07:01.549]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.735 --> 01:07:10.317]  Joining us from Virginia, right outside D.C., a true defender of the Second Amendment, Larry Pratt.
[01:07:11.857 --> 01:07:12.417]  You heard him.
[01:07:12.437 --> 01:07:19.500]  NRA set up basically as a military training auxiliary arm during the Civil War for martial law.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.061]  And they helped get the 1968 Gun Control Act passed.
[01:07:24.141 --> 01:07:27.502]  And you tell gun owners that, you tell NRA members that, they don't believe it.
[01:07:28.283 --> 01:07:32.644]  See, it's our job as real Second Amendment defenders to explain how they're Judascoats.
[01:07:33.422 --> 01:07:36.423]  It's just like the Red Cross involved in all the corruption all the time.
[01:07:36.664 --> 01:07:40.305]  We're not saying you're bad because you volunteered and gave money or went and helped people.
[01:07:40.365 --> 01:07:40.926]  You're good.
[01:07:41.586 --> 01:07:43.527]  But it's the upper echelon.
[01:07:43.547 --> 01:07:44.948]  It's like you give money to the United Way.
[01:07:45.468 --> 01:07:46.148]  You're not bad.
[01:07:46.248 --> 01:07:46.648]  They are.
[01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:47.269]  They've been caught.
[01:07:49.090 --> 01:07:53.632]  They're pushing gun control, folks, and you try to tell people that, they can't believe it.
[01:07:53.952 --> 01:08:01.856]  And so the biggest threat here is that the group with four or five million members, or whatever it is now, people run there for help, and then they don't really help.
[01:08:01.876 --> 01:08:02.656]  They put out rhetoric.
[01:08:03.285 --> 01:08:07.512]  And then you've got groups like Governors of America, that's the second biggest group, but it's tiny in comparison.
[01:08:07.532 --> 01:08:12.681]  Then you've got other little auxiliary groups like Jews and Preservation of Firearms Ownership, that's no compromise.
[01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:17.820]  By the way, Larry, reading this bill, this would ban cops, too.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:22.401]  Just like the family violence or the wife-beater stuff.
[01:08:22.921 --> 01:08:28.582]  If a woman just says she thinks she's endangered, she's never been touched, they go get a restraining order, you lose your Second Amendment.
[01:08:29.662 --> 01:08:32.903]  We told cops that would happen back in 99-2000, it did.
[01:08:33.323 --> 01:08:38.924]  So when you say veterans disarmament, I mean, that's true, but isn't it much, much worse than that, Larry?
[01:08:39.284 --> 01:08:39.604]  It is.
[01:08:40.204 --> 01:08:53.648]  We have admittedly focused on the veteran because he's the guy that's been in harm's way, who's going to be rewarded for having put his life on the line by having his Second Amendment rights taken away from him.
[01:08:53.668 --> 01:08:57.729]  His records will be put in without a court order.
[01:09:01.348 --> 01:09:04.993]  Without any kind of warrant be put into the don't buy a gun list.
[01:09:05.533 --> 01:09:11.401]  83,000 like you were mentioning already have been and a billion bucks in the bill says
[01:09:11.906 --> 01:09:15.127]  Anybody else that hasn't yet been put in would be put in.
[01:09:15.587 --> 01:09:16.707]  And you're absolutely right.
[01:09:17.087 --> 01:09:19.108]  It'll go well beyond veterans.
[01:09:19.208 --> 01:09:27.470]  It'll be the kid that was given some psychiatric drug because he had a fisticuff on the school grounds.
[01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:30.591]  Somebody that was in a domestic situation.
[01:09:31.271 --> 01:09:36.253]  All it takes is a psychiatrist to say that you might be a danger to somebody else.
[01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:38.954]  You don't have to get convicted of anything.
[01:09:39.014 --> 01:09:40.054]  It's not necessary.
[01:09:40.574 --> 01:09:42.075]  Bye-bye gun rights.
[01:09:42.695 --> 01:09:55.059]  And once this lack of due process gets this kind of a toehold in this bill, obviously it's not going to stay there, and the time could well come when people will just be plain locked up.
[01:09:55.259 --> 01:09:57.540]  Now, by the way, Clinton already did this with $83,000.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:58.781]  I was misquoting $86,000.
[01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:00.661]  My memory fails now, folks.
[01:10:00.721 --> 01:10:05.363]  He didn't have to... You're point's quite correct, and it was his Veterans Administration that did that.
[01:10:05.623 --> 01:10:07.184]  And so this has happened before.
[01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.385]  I mean, I've had guests on.
[01:10:08.646 --> 01:10:09.627]  It's even been in the news.
[01:10:09.647 --> 01:10:22.878]  I know countless veterans who have no criminal record, but went to see the Army psychologist after they collapsed in 1972, or 1969, or 1991, and from heat exhaustion in some cases.
[01:10:23.098 --> 01:10:25.280]  And they just, basically everybody just gets it put on.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.342]  And they say, oh, you get three days off.
[01:10:27.402 --> 01:10:28.563]  You've got to take these pills.
[01:10:29.023 --> 01:10:38.634]  We've got a letter on our website at gunowners.org from a retired judge who was talking about some fellas his age that he knows.
[01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:41.057]  They're all Vietnam vets.
[01:10:41.197 --> 01:10:43.239]  The ones he's talking about all have
[01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:49.628]  This post-traumatic stress disorder, and they go see a veteran administration counselor from time to time.
[01:10:49.968 --> 01:10:59.916]  Well, evidently their names haven't got put into the list yet, but what's concerning them is that here they have had careers for 40 years, but most of them are probably retired now.
[01:11:00.316 --> 01:11:02.078]  They've got concealed carry permits.
[01:11:02.118 --> 01:11:02.858]  They've been vetted.
[01:11:02.938 --> 01:11:08.443]  They don't have any crime for 40 years in their background, and yet if this measure passes,
[01:11:09.545 --> 01:11:12.912]  And they've got people that want to come after them, is the point.
[01:11:13.313 --> 01:11:17.562]  Oh, probably the next time they go to renew their CCW, their concealed carry permit,
[01:11:18.052 --> 01:11:23.457]  Not only can you not have your permit renewed, do you have any guns at home?
[01:11:23.737 --> 01:11:25.139]  Those are illegal!
[01:11:25.319 --> 01:11:30.964]  Now, by the way, in New York, in Illinois, in places where they have state laws like this, they're already raiding old people.
[01:11:31.004 --> 01:11:32.005]  I see it in the news every week.
[01:11:32.345 --> 01:11:33.687]  Yes.
[01:11:34.107 --> 01:11:43.696]  And in Maryland, for example, if you want to buy a gun, you have to sign a release to the state police so that they can go at your medical records.
[01:11:44.524 --> 01:11:51.970]  No warrants, just, in order to exercise a constitutionally protected right, you have to sign away your privacy.
[01:11:51.990 --> 01:12:00.016]  Now, where is the hue and cry about... Well, that's how it started in New York, see, and then by the time it ends, no one can have a gun.
[01:12:00.437 --> 01:12:09.584]  Well, the amendments that Coburn's going to make them vote on, one would be no data going into the database without a court order.
[01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:12.607]  That takes away what the Veterans Administration did.
[01:12:13.007 --> 01:12:22.750]  In fact, the names that are already in there have to come out on pain of financial penalty for the FBI and the Veterans Administration.
[01:12:23.310 --> 01:12:26.791]  And lastly, the major amendment that he has is
[01:12:27.431 --> 01:12:33.034]  You have to be adjudicated in the old-fashioned sense of a real court, not a psychiatrist.
[01:12:33.655 --> 01:12:34.375]  Let's be clear.
[01:12:34.695 --> 01:12:35.255]  Let's be clear.
[01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:38.317]  We want the common law, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, due process.
[01:12:38.337 --> 01:12:43.520]  We don't want Napoleonic or Roman civil law where they just say, we say so.
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:44.600]  Amen.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:47.262]  That's what this ballgame is all about.
[01:12:47.302 --> 01:12:55.066]  We're talking about due process, basic protections of the rights of individuals against the mighty power of the government.
[01:12:56.407 --> 01:13:00.530]  By the way, the NRA says, wow, but these veterans can get an expungement.
[01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:05.734]  Okay, that's an amendment that came from the House measure as it was leaving the House.
[01:13:05.774 --> 01:13:07.655]  Yeah, and good luck getting an expungement.
[01:13:07.975 --> 01:13:12.439]  Okay, folks, I know people who are falsely on these lists or misdemeanors keep from getting guns.
[01:13:12.719 --> 01:13:13.840]  It's basically impossible.
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.962]  And the reason is because even when
[01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:25.435]  It was possible before Charlie Schumer shut off funding for it, but now it would be possible again, for a while at least, with this new measure.
[01:13:25.936 --> 01:13:28.738]  That means that you're going to have to prove your innocence.
[01:13:28.818 --> 01:13:36.144]  Now, in a real trial, you have to be proven guilty by the government, and they have to do that behind the scenes.
[01:13:36.164 --> 01:13:36.824]  No, this is a new system.
[01:13:36.905 --> 01:13:38.526]  I'm going to explain this to police listening.
[01:13:39.145 --> 01:13:42.787]  The family courts, the traffic courts, they didn't exist until 60 years ago.
[01:13:42.827 --> 01:13:44.068]  They're not real.
[01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:46.249]  And see, now it's all these other news.
[01:13:46.289 --> 01:13:47.090]  It's not even courts.
[01:13:47.190 --> 01:13:48.651]  It's the computer says.
[01:13:49.051 --> 01:13:50.332]  A psychiatrist says.
[01:13:50.552 --> 01:13:51.993]  A tribunal of any kind.
[01:13:52.113 --> 01:13:56.356]  By the way, psychiatrists have the highest rate of any professional group of suicide.
[01:13:56.376 --> 01:13:58.117]  For some reason, next it's dentists because of the stress.
[01:13:59.157 --> 01:14:02.479]  Maybe it's all the mercury that they put in the air when they do those drills.
[01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:03.620]  Exactly.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.301]  But my point is, they're so nuts.
[01:14:07.466 --> 01:14:10.850]  Look at how the Soviet Union used the psychiatrist.
[01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:15.595]  That would be the end of the road for what we're starting on right here.
[01:14:15.936 --> 01:14:26.108]  Now you only lose your right to keep and bear arms with this lack of due process and the possibility that a psychiatric diagnosis toasts your rights.
[01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:31.229]  But the next step would be, gee, we better have some preventive detentions here.
[01:14:31.529 --> 01:14:34.090]  Hey, Doc, that guy looks dangerous, right, Doc?
[01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:43.852]  By the way, Texas this year at a special session tried to pass it where a doctor or a nurse at a hospital can have you committed indefinitely, instantly.
[01:14:44.092 --> 01:14:46.933]  No judge, no cops, no jury, no nothing.
[01:14:46.953 --> 01:14:53.935]  No facing your accuser, no bringing your own witnesses, nobody arguing on your behalf, just goodbye.
[01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:59.501]  Very, very close to what was happening in the Soviet Union and in Nazi Germany.
[01:14:59.881 --> 01:15:07.009]  They prostituted medicine to that point, and they became an adjunct to the secret police, basically.
[01:15:07.129 --> 01:15:09.251]  No, that's it, and one of the strongest arms of it.
[01:15:09.511 --> 01:15:14.777]  In fact, with Hitler, it started with the psychiatrist killing the infirm, killing the old, killing the retarded.
[01:15:15.177 --> 01:15:17.039]  And then, oh, they're mentally ill.
[01:15:17.119 --> 01:15:17.659]  Kill them.
[01:15:17.699 --> 01:15:19.621]  And then, oh, he's a political dissident.
[01:15:19.941 --> 01:15:25.586]  They started saying psychiatrists could tell if you were lying, and so they could admit that in court.
[01:15:25.686 --> 01:15:26.287]  It's incredible.
[01:15:26.967 --> 01:15:34.914]  That is the ballgame that we're talking about right now, that Senator Coburn is preparing to do battle for to hold this thing off.
[01:15:34.934 --> 01:15:36.356]  Now, I'm glad we've got one senator.
[01:15:36.476 --> 01:15:38.297]  I mean, I just can't believe the NRA
[01:15:39.990 --> 01:15:44.333]  In federal court rulings, he's trying to get them to say everybody should have to register their guns.
[01:15:44.814 --> 01:15:46.775]  I can't believe... Folks, I read it on air!
[01:15:47.056 --> 01:15:51.219]  Directly from the fine law, directly from the federal filings.
[01:15:51.399 --> 01:15:53.360]  You remember that a year and a half ago, two years ago?
[01:15:53.921 --> 01:15:54.161]  Right.
[01:15:54.421 --> 01:16:04.669]  Well, technically they weren't contesting the underlying law if the present one goes away, but it was... The fact of the matter is, if you look at their overall record,
[01:16:05.510 --> 01:16:18.805]  They have, as Franklin Orr said back in 1968, supported every, since the beginning, since their beginning in 1871, that was his statement, they have supported workable and effective gun control legislation.
[01:16:20.286 --> 01:16:21.267]  They are the fathers.
[01:16:21.287 --> 01:16:23.889]  The NRA is the father of gun control.
[01:16:23.909 --> 01:16:36.757]  You know, Larry, in the few minutes we've got left, and I want to come back and plug your membership, try to get people to join, because you need soldiers and you need financial support right now more than ever, but run through some of the NRA history for those that don't know.
[01:16:37.618 --> 01:16:41.500]  Well, we had a guy go down to the archives the other day.
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:47.144]  We were looking for something on behalf of something our attorneys at the foundation are doing.
[01:16:47.972 --> 01:16:52.820]  And he ran across a letter from, I think his name was Cummins, at the NRA.
[01:16:53.482 --> 01:17:05.190]  Arguing that the National Firearms Act, that was still a proposal at that time, hadn't been enacted in 1934, didn't go far enough and basically he was proposing what we would now call a semi-auto ban.
[01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:08.553]  Now was Cummins the head of the NRA or a board member at that time?
[01:17:09.253 --> 01:17:15.618]  You know, I'm going to have to take a look when I get an actual copy of the letter, but he was speaking for the NRA.
[01:17:16.138 --> 01:17:18.700]  So an official NRA letter to the government.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.261]  Exactly right.
[01:17:20.301 --> 01:17:21.242]  Who was that letter to again?
[01:17:21.842 --> 01:17:36.338]  Uh, it was to, I believe it was to, it may have been to the Attorney General, because that's where a guy was looking around for stuff, but the fact of the matter is that they didn't think that the Socialist Administration of Roosevelt went far enough.
[01:17:36.738 --> 01:17:37.539]  Oh my goodness!
[01:17:37.939 --> 01:17:42.064]  And so, that kind of, happily, they sort of backed off from that.
[01:17:42.444 --> 01:17:43.205]  We're good to go.
[01:18:07.965 --> 01:18:10.547]  But now it's electronic and now it's accessible.
[01:18:10.887 --> 01:18:11.868]  Now it's a dragnet.
[01:18:12.548 --> 01:18:15.130]  Now folks, I want fake conservatives to listen.
[01:18:15.650 --> 01:18:17.612]  Everything Larry Pratt's saying is documented.
[01:18:18.072 --> 01:18:21.534]  Do you understand the father of gun control is the NRA?
[01:18:21.554 --> 01:18:23.095]  Do you understand they were for the 68?
[01:18:23.375 --> 01:18:25.617]  They were for what happened in the late 90s.
[01:18:25.657 --> 01:18:26.137]  They're behind this.
[01:18:27.618 --> 01:18:40.443]  And then they have the fake liberal media attack them, and then that fools you into supporting them, just like the Federal Reserve paid newspapers to write articles against the Federal Reserve Act, claiming that the bankers were against the Federal Reserve Act.
[01:18:40.983 --> 01:18:42.324]  See, that's how they trick you.
[01:18:42.604 --> 01:18:44.405]  Larry Pratt, this is so historical.
[01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:45.265]  Stay with us.
[01:18:45.385 --> 01:18:47.246]  Please tell us more on the other side.
[01:18:52.711 --> 01:18:57.194]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:18:57.535 --> 01:19:01.618]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:19:01.918 --> 01:19:02.478]  We listened.
[01:19:02.778 --> 01:19:07.762]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:08.523]  We listened.
[01:19:08.923 --> 01:19:11.945]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:19:12.386 --> 01:19:12.906]  We listened.
[01:19:13.346 --> 01:19:17.431]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:19:17.811 --> 01:19:18.292]  We listened.
[01:19:18.632 --> 01:19:23.878]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:19:24.299 --> 01:19:25.660]  Again, we listened.
[01:19:26.021 --> 01:19:27.562]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[01:19:28.143 --> 01:19:30.744]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[01:19:30.764 --> 01:19:30.924]  Only $279.
[01:19:30.964 --> 01:19:31.984]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:19:32.004 --> 01:19:32.624]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:32.784 --> 01:19:34.845]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:19:34.885 --> 01:19:35.625]  Available in Iowa.
[01:19:50.382 --> 01:19:54.046]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:54.446 --> 01:19:59.872]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:00.333 --> 01:20:01.414]  It makes me wonder if a U.S.
[01:20:01.454 --> 01:20:05.499]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:19.466]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:19.946 --> 01:20:25.269]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:25.549 --> 01:20:31.452]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:20:32.212 --> 01:20:33.453]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:33.474 --> 01:20:35.175]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:20:35.195 --> 01:20:35.555]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:35.616 --> 01:20:37.657]  Exercise your legal rights to trade metals privately.
[01:20:37.677 --> 01:20:37.737]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:49.739 --> 01:20:51.461]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:20:51.841 --> 01:20:55.204]  If it happens, you want to be ready to give your loved ones a fighting chance.
[01:20:55.484 --> 01:20:59.927]  Do not rely on someone else to come through for you at a time when it could be about life and death.
[01:21:00.308 --> 01:21:05.292]  Your best chance is Safe Castle Royal, the premier crisis preparedness buyer's club out there.
[01:21:05.632 --> 01:21:12.678]  Members get everything at rock-bottom pricing, with at least 20% off everything in our store all the time, and free shipping to the lower 48.
[01:21:13.158 --> 01:21:16.581]  Emergency storage food, prefab shelters and safe rooms,
[01:21:16.681 --> 01:21:16.961]  I think so.
[01:21:32.759 --> 01:21:34.700]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:39.322]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[01:21:56.749 --> 01:21:57.670]  Symptoms are there.
[01:21:57.950 --> 01:22:06.120]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:12.087]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:22:12.247 --> 01:22:14.008]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:22:14.089 --> 01:22:16.250]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:22:16.370 --> 01:22:20.614]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:22:20.794 --> 01:22:22.936]  I recommend Fartin Body Extract to everyone.
[01:22:23.016 --> 01:22:30.102]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:32.600]  We're good to go.
[01:23:00.528 --> 01:23:05.254]  Before we get into the history of the NRA with Larry, I'm going to be back on for a full hour to do this soon.
[01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:11.080]  Larry, I've told the listeners to call to join, but I don't think I've
[01:23:11.770 --> 01:23:12.951]  Point out how serious it is.
[01:23:12.991 --> 01:23:15.894]  The NRA isn't just conflicted and compromised.
[01:23:15.934 --> 01:23:16.655]  Larry's been nice.
[01:23:16.675 --> 01:23:20.338]  They're only conflicted in that they want to act like they're pro-Second Amendment to fool you.
[01:23:20.878 --> 01:23:23.541]  They are enemies of the Republic, period.
[01:23:23.561 --> 01:23:26.003]  And as they were exposed, they got more hardcore.
[01:23:26.483 --> 01:23:31.228]  And then we saw, you know, Bob Barr on the show, NRA board members say, Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton.
[01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:35.251]  They have supported the last three big gun initiatives even before that.
[01:23:35.572 --> 01:23:36.893]  But in the 30s, in the
[01:23:37.837 --> 01:23:40.581]  Sixties, and in the 1990s, and then now.
[01:23:40.601 --> 01:23:42.583]  So there's four big initiatives.
[01:23:43.425 --> 01:23:48.411]  And, uh, Governors of America is the next biggest group, and they're tiny in comparison.
[01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:49.933]  You could change that.
[01:23:50.073 --> 01:23:51.014]  You could become members.
[01:23:51.094 --> 01:23:54.619]  A membership, and you get the newsletter, and all the benefits of that.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.041]  Twenty bucks.
[01:23:56.801 --> 01:23:58.363]  How much to be a lifetime member, Larry?
[01:23:59.143 --> 01:23:58.363]  500.
[01:24:00.084 --> 01:24:00.465]  You know what?
[01:24:00.805 --> 01:24:01.966]  I'm going to become a member.
[01:24:02.447 --> 01:24:03.728]  I'm a little cash-strapped right now.
[01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:07.511]  I'm not going to become a lifetime right now, but those that are should become a lifetime.
[01:24:07.552 --> 01:24:11.916]  These guys will proudly on an airplane tell me they're a lifetime member of the NRA, and I don't even want to...
[01:24:13.490 --> 01:24:19.153]  I'm not kidding when I say this, folks.
[01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:20.473]  They're Judascoats.
[01:24:20.893 --> 01:24:28.696]  People need to call Larry Pratt right now, and you need to become lifetime members, or bare minimum, a yearly member for $20.
[01:24:29.337 --> 01:24:30.317]  They need the money.
[01:24:30.577 --> 01:24:32.018]  They are fighting tooth and nail.
[01:24:32.278 --> 01:24:35.339]  The NRA is telling you to go with the victim disarmament bill.
[01:24:35.639 --> 01:24:36.539]  Larry, how do they call you?
[01:24:36.559 --> 01:24:37.300]  How do they become members?
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:39.541]  Well, they can call at toll-free number 888-622-9000.
[01:24:42.203 --> 01:24:49.810]  And if they get on the internet, that's the easiest way.
[01:24:49.850 --> 01:24:51.251]  Go to gunowners.org.
[01:24:52.052 --> 01:24:53.934]  And there's really two places to join.
[01:24:54.054 --> 01:24:56.016]  One's a freebie, an email alert list.
[01:24:56.376 --> 01:25:00.820]  And I really need to be sending email to the Senate right now.
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:02.762]  Not, you know, this evening.
[01:25:03.203 --> 01:25:03.443]  Now.
[01:25:04.077 --> 01:25:09.080]  Because this is coming down and the Senate needs to know they're starting to shake things loose by what they're doing.
[01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:09.720]  You know what?
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:11.001]  I'm going to put my money where my mouth is.
[01:25:11.021 --> 01:25:13.582]  Just like I've given to Ron Paul about four times, my dad has.
[01:25:13.922 --> 01:25:15.223]  I'm going to become a lifetime member.
[01:25:15.243 --> 01:25:15.963]  500 bucks.
[01:25:16.264 --> 01:25:22.427]  What will you do with that 500 bucks when I call 888-6GUNS?
[01:25:22.447 --> 01:25:23.968]  888-6GUNS or GunOwners.org?
[01:25:24.648 --> 01:25:29.631]  Well, one of the things that I would very much like to see us do is get into the YouTube generation.
[01:25:30.622 --> 01:25:33.163]  A little call it a home studio.
[01:25:33.223 --> 01:25:34.423]  A weekly news report.
[01:25:34.443 --> 01:25:36.364]  Just put a background behind you to the weekly report.
[01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:37.724]  Something like that.
[01:25:37.764 --> 01:25:45.226]  Also, when something comes up in a local city, San Francisco is always doing something nutty, to be able to respond to that.
[01:25:45.266 --> 01:25:49.167]  And by the way, for an organization, you've got to have an extra webmaster, a video guy.
[01:25:49.227 --> 01:25:50.487]  It's going to take some money, folks.
[01:25:50.927 --> 01:25:56.009]  It's a researcher, or two or three, to be able to keep up with all that, to get the
[01:25:57.029 --> 01:25:59.512]  Well, we're well into the third decade.
[01:26:16.445 --> 01:26:20.208]  Folks, I'm telling you, the NRA needs to be arrested, the leadership, or a treasonist.
[01:26:20.288 --> 01:26:23.130]  And when I say that, I mean, this is espionage.
[01:26:23.651 --> 01:26:28.114]  The people, we ought to dig them up, people from the 30s, the 60s, that was treason.
[01:26:28.154 --> 01:26:34.899]  To pose as conservatives, and then to try to pass gun control, and to successfully do it, and now to support this, I mean, I'm serious.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.361]  Chuckie Schumer needs to be tried for treason.
[01:26:37.562 --> 01:26:38.883]  Because I've had enough, man.
[01:26:38.923 --> 01:26:40.264]  This is our guns.
[01:26:40.544 --> 01:26:41.825]  They want to have their way with us.
[01:26:42.205 --> 01:26:43.485]  Triple 8, 8-8, 6 guns.
[01:26:43.585 --> 01:26:47.466]  And I'm sorry to be that hardcore, Larry, but I mean, we need to start talking about treason here.
[01:26:48.126 --> 01:26:52.247]  Well, I very much appreciate your support, and that means a lot.
[01:26:52.307 --> 01:26:58.508]  And I think because you've got such a large and faithful listenership, that that could really help.
[01:26:58.588 --> 01:27:05.270]  And I hope people will at least do something today, send some email, because nobody else is talking about this.
[01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:08.811]  The NRA's not asking their folks to support a gun control measure.
[01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:10.611]  We're the only group that's out there
[01:27:11.158 --> 01:27:17.401]  Hustling the grassroots, asking, will you please let these guys know that this is gun control?
[01:27:17.561 --> 01:27:21.943]  Because otherwise, all we're hearing from the NRA is, no problem, don't worry.
[01:27:21.963 --> 01:27:25.205]  Again, I'm not saying the members of the NRA are great.
[01:27:25.325 --> 01:27:34.829]  I'm telling you the leadership, not the whole board, but over the history, there have been traitors in there who knowingly lied and told people it was good and got gun control passed.
[01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:38.671]  And Larry, I want to get you up the next few days to do the history because we're out of time.
[01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:43.774]  But 888-886-GUNS, 888-886-GUNS.
[01:27:44.094 --> 01:27:45.295]  Or gunowners.org.
[01:27:45.395 --> 01:27:46.476]  Gunowners.org.
[01:27:46.516 --> 01:27:49.538]  But in the minute we've got left, just a little bit more history on the NRA.
[01:27:50.358 --> 01:27:57.763]  Well, it was started in 1871, and they for a long time were just simply a shooting organization.
[01:27:57.823 --> 01:28:02.606]  They didn't get started into the political arena directly until 1976, when
[01:28:05.009 --> 01:28:14.252]  Interestingly enough, Gun Owners of America was also organized at that time because we saw that the NRA wasn't doing anything in the political arena.
[01:28:14.272 --> 01:28:23.575]  The 1968 Gun Control Act had come and gone and the BATF was running out of control during all that time and really very little was being done to stop it.
[01:28:24.635 --> 01:28:28.176]  And now you've got a letter from back in the 30s where they're writing to the
[01:28:29.165 --> 01:28:33.029]  Secretary, they're writing to the Attorney General saying, hey, we need more gun control.
[01:28:33.049 --> 01:28:35.953]  We need, yeah, more guns to end.
[01:28:36.754 --> 01:28:37.434]  It's incredible.
[01:28:37.454 --> 01:28:38.956]  Alright, God bless you, Larry Pratt.
[01:28:38.976 --> 01:28:39.857]  Let me talk to you during the break.
[01:28:41.258 --> 01:28:42.219]  We're on the march.
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:44.282]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:45.163 --> 01:28:47.846]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:59.415]  Hi, this is Jeff Rents, and if you're interested in suppressed natural cures and rare exotic remedies, this may be the most important message you'll hear for a long time.
[01:28:59.796 --> 01:29:09.104]  There's an opportunity right now for a limited number of listeners to acquire an amazing, blacklisted, naturally occurring compound with very unusual ionic properties.
[01:29:09.464 --> 01:29:13.788]  In fact, it's considered the single most important remedy in all of Ayurvedic medicine.
[01:29:14.268 --> 01:29:26.354]  Medical studies have been conducted abroad on the effects this rare mineral-like compound has on energy, diabetes, tumors, ulcers, memory and brain function, not to mention reproductive health, exercise recovery and arthritis.
[01:29:26.654 --> 01:29:31.537]  Because of the rules governing nutritional supplements in this country, no health or healing claims can be made.
[01:29:31.957 --> 01:29:34.499]  However, it's still quite legal to own this compound.
[01:29:34.559 --> 01:29:35.319]  And the best part?
[01:29:35.679 --> 01:29:37.200]  My listeners pay nothing down.
[01:29:37.260 --> 01:29:38.941]  Simply go to blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:39.101 --> 01:29:41.043]  That's blacklistedherb.com.
[01:29:41.183 --> 01:29:41.703]  Or call 815-259-4552.
[01:29:41.963 --> 01:29:42.503]  That's 815-259-4552 for details.
[01:29:50.447 --> 01:29:52.409]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:29:52.669 --> 01:29:55.712]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:29:55.993 --> 01:30:00.697]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:30:01.077 --> 01:30:03.820]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:08.745]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[01:30:09.025 --> 01:30:10.927]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:30:11.407 --> 01:30:21.356]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology, and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[01:30:21.716 --> 01:30:26.420]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:30.303]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars!
[01:30:30.543 --> 01:30:32.685]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[01:30:33.005 --> 01:30:35.147]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[01:30:35.327 --> 01:30:40.530]  We'll even refund the shipping charge, share the oil company's secret, and get SFR now.
[01:30:40.751 --> 01:30:41.651]  What are you waiting for?
[01:30:41.831 --> 01:30:44.853]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[01:30:45.854 --> 01:30:49.216]  That's 1-888-873-7371.
[01:30:49.376 --> 01:30:49.776]  Today!
[01:30:50.317 --> 01:30:54.920]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:58.162]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[01:30:58.522 --> 01:31:01.103]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[01:31:01.463 --> 01:31:06.284]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[01:31:06.664 --> 01:31:12.026]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[01:31:12.326 --> 01:31:15.287]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[01:31:15.487 --> 01:31:17.028]  Which goes into effect May 11, 2008.
[01:31:18.148 --> 01:31:22.870]  Many people believe that this will be the Mark of the Beast because of the restrictive measures included.
[01:31:23.050 --> 01:31:27.171]  Which seems to parallel the no buying and selling of Revelations 13-17.
[01:31:27.491 --> 01:31:33.773]  In Revelations 14-9, speaking of the Mark of the Beast, it says, If any man worship the Beast, take notice.
[01:31:34.113 --> 01:31:35.734]  It says, Worship the Beast.
[01:31:36.014 --> 01:31:38.615]  This issue is about worship, not economics.
[01:31:38.755 --> 01:31:41.217]  Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have another kiss.
[01:32:09.435 --> 01:32:20.860]  We just had Larry Pratt on.
[01:32:20.900 --> 01:32:24.882]  They were set up in 1976 because the NRA was selling us out.
[01:32:25.242 --> 01:32:27.443]  They pushed the 68 gun control act.
[01:32:28.824 --> 01:32:31.705]  They pushed the Brady system.
[01:32:31.805 --> 01:32:34.586]  They, quote, compromise.
[01:32:35.106 --> 01:32:36.367]  They're the Judas Iscariot.
[01:32:37.211 --> 01:32:43.614]  And, uh, you need to go join Gun Owners of America 888-886, and then guns.
[01:32:44.454 --> 01:32:45.734]  Or just go to GunOwners.org.
[01:32:45.794 --> 01:32:53.077]  I'm telling you, you need to join, you need to support them, so we can get a real organization with enough members to fight for the Second Amendment, while they're trying to disarm our veterans right now.
[01:32:53.097 --> 01:33:03.921]  And we've got that posted, and the bill posted, HR 2640, any post-traumatic stress disorder, any ADHD, all these fake designations, no gun ownership anymore!
[01:33:05.322 --> 01:33:05.742]  Period!
[01:33:06.517 --> 01:33:09.961]  On the verge of passing right now and Bush says he'll sign it.
[01:33:10.962 --> 01:33:23.654]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now and go to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former editor of the Wall Street Journal, father of ergonomics, chief economist at the Treasury, number two there, and I really, he's a gracious person.
[01:33:23.674 --> 01:33:25.816]  I wish he had a book he was pitching, I wish he had a newsletter.
[01:33:25.836 --> 01:33:26.577]  No, just for free,
[01:33:27.448 --> 01:33:29.349]  And again, most people have to make a living.
[01:33:29.369 --> 01:33:29.969]  He's retired.
[01:33:29.989 --> 01:33:36.112]  It's just so gracious he comes on all the time, all these shows and everything he does, and he hasn't even pitched anything but liberty and freedom.
[01:33:36.692 --> 01:33:45.396]  And I wanted to get his take on Greenspan saying the dollar's plunging, pushing for that before it plunged even further, saying it was going to plunge, knowing it would do that.
[01:33:46.056 --> 01:33:46.916]  Well, Alex, I wouldn't know
[01:34:14.176 --> 01:34:22.399]  If there were some motivations of the sort you described, I wouldn't know anything about that.
[01:34:23.579 --> 01:34:42.806]  I do agree that Greenspan's low interest rates created a housing bubble, caused people to get in financial difficulties.
[01:34:45.098 --> 01:34:51.984]  And they use that to keep the economy going, I guess, you know, for Bush.
[01:34:53.426 --> 01:35:10.881]  And I think that they're now using easy money to bail out the financial institution holding the troubled subprime derivatives.
[01:35:11.932 --> 01:35:13.854]  Many of which seem to be leveraged.
[01:35:15.135 --> 01:35:25.123]  And that the consequence of this new dose of liquidity will be further pressure on the dollar.
[01:35:27.065 --> 01:35:39.516]  And of course, I don't see how it's in their interest to put further pressure on the dollar because it might not take a whole lot more to knock it
[01:35:40.568 --> 01:35:54.960]  out of its reserve currency role, and if it loses its reserve currency role, there's no way we can finance the domestic government budget deficit or the enormous U.S.
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:55.841]  trade deficit.
[01:35:55.861 --> 01:35:57.983]  So I don't see how it benefits them.
[01:35:58.043 --> 01:36:07.070]  I think it's more likely to happen from their stupidity and incompetence and their inability to see how things
[01:36:08.397 --> 01:36:14.846]  are connected as opposed to some master plan in which they can see how everything is connected.
[01:36:15.567 --> 01:36:19.072]  I just don't remember people in Washington being that intelligent.
[01:36:19.913 --> 01:36:26.041]  Generally, they were not aware of the consequences of their actions.
[01:36:27.342 --> 01:36:37.810]  Well, the Financial Times of London said that the big central banks are basically, I can send you the article, recklessly trying to blow things out.
[01:36:37.870 --> 01:36:42.994]  They issued the credit so that the brokerage houses and smaller banks would then get over and extended.
[01:36:43.254 --> 01:36:47.317]  Then the big banks wouldn't buy that paper, which we know they've not been doing for two months.
[01:36:47.557 --> 01:36:51.120]  Then that bankrupts them and they get it all for basically chicken feed.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:56.384]  And then the Financial Times said that basically it's very dangerous and that it could cause a crash.
[01:36:56.944 --> 01:37:01.728]  They said we agree with a slow decline of the U.S., but we don't like this fast decline.
[01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:15.858]  Well, I don't see how it's in the interest of the powers that be to destroy their base, which is the U.S.
[01:37:16.939 --> 01:37:25.645]  So I think that what's basically happening is that in efforts to bail out
[01:37:26.198 --> 01:37:35.742]  The only reason the United States government can borrow abroad is because of the reserve currency status.
[01:37:35.822 --> 01:37:41.025]  It's the only reason people finance our huge trade and budget deficits.
[01:37:56.169 --> 01:38:02.791]  And so, if we lose that, then we're just a banana republic.
[01:38:03.051 --> 01:38:25.099]  Dr. Roberts, we had Bernanke, the current Fed Chairman, we had the former Fed Chairman Greenspan, and the one before him, Volcker, all simultaneously, not this last weekend, but the weekend before last, as you know, announced that the dollar was going to go down and be replaced by the Euro, announced that housing was going to plunge, announced that we were going to have horrible inflation, maybe even stagflation.
[01:38:26.002 --> 01:38:34.091]  As you talked about a month ago on the show, and they know that even if that was true, by saying it was going to make it worse, then they look like heroes on Monday.
[01:38:34.371 --> 01:38:36.253]  They cut it, as you know, 50 basis points.
[01:38:36.754 --> 01:38:42.120]  It looked like a schizophrenic move, but now they get to kill the economy, but then also claim they saved it short term.
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.941]  Well, I've been predicting the dollar's demise, as you know, for some time now.
[01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:12.775]  Those reasons, but for other reasons as well.
[01:39:13.315 --> 01:39:20.539]  But sir, we've got China threatening to do it, and then it's like Greenspan and Bernanke go, OK, we'll just do it first!
[01:39:21.780 --> 01:39:23.501]  I mean, does that not what it looks like?
[01:39:24.542 --> 01:39:27.624]  Well, it may look like that, but I don't think that's what it is.
[01:39:27.644 --> 01:39:39.311]  And it may well be Greenspan and his crew covering up for their own
[01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:50.790]  Uh, failures or manipulations in order to keep Bush riding high while he fought a war.
[01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:52.531]  Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:39:52.551 --> 01:39:57.995]  You're saying that since it's going to go down, they're now jumping in and making the announcement like they heralded it.
[01:39:58.416 --> 01:39:59.376]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:00.898 --> 01:40:07.543]  I think that the low interest rates were to keep the economy going for two reasons.
[01:40:08.621 --> 01:40:10.241]  We're good to go.
[01:40:38.928 --> 01:40:45.032]  The entire Bush presidency has been based on consumers going deeper in debt.
[01:40:45.332 --> 01:40:46.633]  Oh, I agree with that analysis.
[01:40:46.653 --> 01:40:48.174]  And household equity.
[01:40:48.194 --> 01:40:51.556]  So I think that's what they were doing.
[01:40:51.616 --> 01:40:59.561]  The consequences for the dollar were there the whole time, as I pointed out.
[01:40:59.621 --> 01:41:05.605]  And the real problem with the dollar is the offshoring, because we are now so dependent
[01:41:06.844 --> 01:41:12.327]  on goods made abroad, primarily by American firms who relocated abroad.
[01:41:12.347 --> 01:41:14.368]  But when they come back in, they count as imports.
[01:41:15.489 --> 01:41:26.675]  So we have these tremendous trade deficits that we don't still make enough in the United States to sell the balance.
[01:41:27.415 --> 01:41:35.099]  And so what finances trade deficits is the fact that the dollars reserve currency, so people are willing to hold it
[01:41:35.856 --> 01:41:36.096]  Yes.
[01:42:04.654 --> 01:42:09.899]  I just saw it the other day, sir.
[01:42:09.999 --> 01:42:16.205]  It's at 59 point something.
[01:42:16.265 --> 01:42:18.206]  So, it's going to come down.
[01:42:19.007 --> 01:42:24.532]  Greenspan said that the Euro could be a substitute.
[01:42:24.572 --> 01:42:27.275]  We've talked about that trouble, too, Alex.
[01:42:27.355 --> 01:42:30.638]  The Euro is a currency.
[01:42:31.954 --> 01:42:34.474]  of a political unit that doesn't really exist.
[01:42:34.855 --> 01:42:37.735]  It's a quasi-existence.
[01:42:37.835 --> 01:42:50.397]  I mean, the notion of Europe as a political entity is something that some of them have been pushing for, but it's still separate countries.
[01:42:50.417 --> 01:42:54.758]  And England is a part of the EU, but it's not a part of the Euro.
[01:42:55.978 --> 01:42:59.359]  Other countries are in the Euro, but they don't have
[01:43:02.001 --> 01:43:03.582]  They haven't become states.
[01:43:04.082 --> 01:43:16.547]  Well, as you know, sir, that's the European Union's argument that as the dollar declines, that will force people to recognize and strengthen the euro, which it's done from opening at 80 to the dollar, and now at 142 plus against the dollar.
[01:43:16.807 --> 01:43:30.172]  There's no doubt that a weakening dollar is strengthening the euro, but going back to your point about them using this salve, or this drugging, to speed up the economy artificially on debt, while they completed their de-industrialization and their globalization,
[01:43:31.273 --> 01:43:33.135]  I mean, where do you see it then fleshing out?
[01:43:33.155 --> 01:43:37.599]  I don't want to get into your two police brutality articles you read in the last couple of weeks.
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:49.712]  Alex, it's wonderful how you can just sort of lump all these things together.
[01:43:49.752 --> 01:43:51.854]  You're right, there are some connections.
[01:43:54.028 --> 01:44:07.457]  I think the police brutality has always been a problem.
[01:44:07.797 --> 01:44:18.483]  I just wanted to see where you now think with this new economic data coming in, forecasting with a clearer picture, if you can give us an estimation of what you see happening in the economy.
[01:44:19.264 --> 01:44:20.125]  Oh, in the economy?
[01:44:20.825 --> 01:44:22.366]  Yes sir, and then get into police state.
[01:44:24.284 --> 01:44:51.247]  Well, it's not clear how the economy can be kept going now because the consumers are so maxed out in debt and the principal asset that most of them have in homes are now aren't selling, are falling in price.
[01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:59.172]  And there's no more equity in that asset for them to bleed out and spend.
[01:44:59.232 --> 01:45:09.537]  So where will the purchasing power in the consumer's hands come from to keep driving the economy?
[01:45:09.597 --> 01:45:19.922]  I don't see where that is unless the owners of capital start sharing the productivity gains
[01:45:21.169 --> 01:45:21.469]  I think so.
[01:45:39.375 --> 01:45:40.616]  In fact, we're seeing the reverse.
[01:45:40.656 --> 01:45:46.277]  We're seeing actual salaries stay the same or go down when they're averaged in with inflation.
[01:45:47.018 --> 01:45:50.038]  So we're seeing all the forecasts from decades ago.
[01:45:50.078 --> 01:45:57.221]  If we don't have any jobs or any manufacturing, at a certain point, Americans won't be able to buy these goods anymore because they won't have jobs.
[01:45:57.521 --> 01:46:02.022]  And the argument was, well, we've got the dollar, but then now the dollar is being debased.
[01:46:02.102 --> 01:46:04.343]  So it's unbelievable.
[01:46:04.603 --> 01:46:08.424]  Well, when they go to buy these foreign goods in Wal-Mart,
[01:46:11.842 --> 01:46:24.393]  As long as the Chinese keep their currency pegged to the dollar, the American consumer won't really experience the ruin.
[01:46:25.233 --> 01:46:33.901]  But the minute we, for some reason, the American authorities keep beating up on the Chinese not to peg,
[01:46:35.003 --> 01:46:35.544]  I don't think so.
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.901]  But see, Robert, you just hit the nail on the head right there.
[01:46:48.041 --> 01:46:50.163]  Okay, we've got Greenspan bad-mouthing the dollar.
[01:46:50.603 --> 01:46:55.948]  For two years, they've been bad-mouthing the over-value of real estate, trying to pop that cash sink.
[01:46:56.949 --> 01:47:00.592]  They're running around trying to get the Chinese to do something that'll hurt the American people.
[01:47:00.832 --> 01:47:02.793]  They're busy shipping all our jobs overseas.
[01:47:03.134 --> 01:47:07.958]  I mean, they're not accidentally just doing all these things exactly right to hurt us.
[01:47:08.338 --> 01:47:11.300]  I mean, it can't be an accident that they're doing the entire exact thing.
[01:47:11.341 --> 01:47:12.582]  Well, it actually can be.
[01:47:17.604 --> 01:47:29.491]  You see, most of them in Washington, they still think in terms of free trade, and they think that free trade is always good and it doesn't hurt anybody and it fits both sides.
[01:47:29.971 --> 01:47:35.895]  They've not figured out that offshore production is not anything to do with trade.
[01:47:36.135 --> 01:47:39.077]  It's with labor arbitrage, as we've talked about before.
[01:47:39.717 --> 01:47:40.958]  But they can't figure that out.
[01:47:42.651 --> 01:47:46.313]  And every time I tell them, it just kind of goes over their heads.
[01:47:46.433 --> 01:47:49.114]  It's not anything they've been able to get their minds around.
[01:47:49.134 --> 01:47:54.277]  So they think, oh, we have always benefited from free trade.
[01:47:54.797 --> 01:47:55.898]  It always works.
[01:47:56.558 --> 01:48:05.662]  And they think that the only trouble is that the dollar is out of adjustment because the Chinese have fixed the price of their currency.
[01:48:06.143 --> 01:48:09.544]  And therefore, if they could just get the Chinese currency
[01:48:12.313 --> 01:48:18.717]  At a market rate, the dollar then would go down.
[01:48:18.937 --> 01:48:21.958]  But the Chinese are actually trying to keep their market.
[01:48:22.038 --> 01:48:24.900]  I want to tell you what they think, Alec.
[01:48:25.940 --> 01:48:28.021]  I'm not trying to defend it, I'm telling you what they think.
[01:48:29.002 --> 01:48:39.567]  So, they think then, if the dollar went down, we would sell more to China, but we'd buy less, and therefore the trade would go into balance.
[01:48:40.256 --> 01:48:54.745]  Now, so what they're trying to do is superimpose a free market way of thinking over what is not free market, but offshore production.
[01:48:54.785 --> 01:48:59.707]  The American firms have simply relocated their production somewhere else.
[01:49:00.928 --> 01:49:06.051]  Or, they've relocated a lot of it, which comes back in as imports.
[01:49:06.111 --> 01:49:08.853]  So, there's no way
[01:49:09.744 --> 01:49:22.328]  We can escape, the consumer cannot escape a lower real living standard from a Chinese revaluation.
[01:49:22.368 --> 01:49:24.869]  They just don't understand that.
[01:49:25.009 --> 01:49:26.290]  Well, I mean, I'm going to lay down to this.
[01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.830]  We've got a break.
[01:49:27.090 --> 01:49:27.590]  We've got a break.
[01:49:27.710 --> 01:49:28.991]  Dr. Roberts, come back and tell us what you think.
[01:49:29.011 --> 01:49:29.891]  We're on the other side.
[01:49:30.671 --> 01:49:34.293]  And just in closing, to simplify it, I want to get your take on this when we get back.
[01:49:35.293 --> 01:49:37.954]  It's not free trade if it's a slave state.
[01:49:38.951 --> 01:49:40.811]  That's how we live our standard of living.
[01:49:41.672 --> 01:49:42.632]  It's really simple.
[01:49:42.752 --> 01:49:59.155]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:49:59.495 --> 01:50:07.136]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:07.842 --> 01:50:14.888]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:15.288 --> 01:50:26.697]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:27.038 --> 01:50:30.681]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:31.001 --> 01:50:32.902]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:33.263 --> 01:50:37.086]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:50.593 --> 01:50:55.817]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:55.957 --> 01:51:04.062]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:04.302 --> 01:51:11.367]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:11.547 --> 01:51:12.828]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:12.908 --> 01:51:18.790]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:18.990 --> 01:51:24.072]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:24.192 --> 01:51:33.056]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:33.336 --> 01:51:36.837]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:51:50.147 --> 01:51:50.547]  Attention!
[01:51:50.727 --> 01:51:52.648]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[01:51:52.869 --> 01:51:57.112]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:51:57.292 --> 01:52:00.234]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:52:00.454 --> 01:52:01.395]  The answer is easy.
[01:52:01.535 --> 01:52:07.039]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees.
[01:52:07.039 --> 01:52:07.459]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.773 --> 01:52:34.634]  I thought that a parasitic dream would never come back.
[01:52:34.654 --> 01:52:35.914]  That painted my hands and face blue.
[01:53:03.583 --> 01:53:10.106]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our guest.
[01:53:10.146 --> 01:53:20.571]  We were just talking during the break, and it's a short term versus long term goals.
[01:53:20.611 --> 01:53:21.651]  Short term, it's good.
[01:53:31.515 --> 01:53:32.796]  Alright Alex, it's not a question.
[01:54:00.942 --> 01:54:07.664]  That the American firms can't compete with Chinese firms because Chinese firms have slave labor.
[01:54:07.724 --> 01:54:09.264]  That's not the problem at all.
[01:54:09.304 --> 01:54:13.346]  We're not trying to compete with Chinese firms.
[01:54:13.906 --> 01:54:28.850]  The problem is that the American firms have relocated in China and are themselves using the cheap Chinese labor to make the American brand names that they sell in the States.
[01:54:30.129 --> 01:54:49.332]  So they simply have replaced the American workforce with a Chinese workforce so that the American consumers of the products no longer are making those products.
[01:54:49.352 --> 01:54:55.373]  So they're deprived of the incomes associated with the production of those products.
[01:54:55.413 --> 01:54:57.774]  So this has nothing to do with trade.
[01:54:57.894 --> 01:54:58.594]  It has to do
[01:54:59.850 --> 01:55:09.535]  with the offshoring of production for our home markets in order to take advantage of lower costs abroad.
[01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:15.318]  So it's not a trade argument at all.
[01:55:15.378 --> 01:55:29.266]  And that's why protection wouldn't be an answer because normally we think of protection as protecting domestic firms from foreign firms' products.
[01:55:32.904 --> 01:55:47.573]  But the domestic firms are the ones that are making the products abroad and are bringing them back in so the terrorists would go against the domestic firms and they would be opposed and lobby against them and prevent their passage in Congress.
[01:55:47.633 --> 01:55:52.056]  So that is the situation that we really face.
[01:55:52.136 --> 01:55:55.338]  It's a dilemma for economic theory because
[01:55:55.987 --> 01:56:08.134]  There's no longer any connection between the profit motive of the corporations, of American corporations, and the general welfare of the population.
[01:56:08.514 --> 01:56:10.495]  All it did was end game.
[01:56:11.056 --> 01:56:20.601]  All it did was make it to where the power got centralized more in those global corporations and it weakened the nation-state, which is what the globalists say they want.
[01:56:21.382 --> 01:56:22.322]  Well, look, what...
[01:56:24.620 --> 01:56:37.491]  In economic theory, there is a connection between the profit motive of firms and the general welfare of the population.
[01:56:38.872 --> 01:56:45.158]  But when the firms are based offshore, that connection is broken.
[01:56:45.778 --> 01:56:51.103]  So all of the assumptions about how capitalism
[01:56:51.835 --> 01:56:53.976]  No, it's nothing of that.
[01:56:54.716 --> 01:56:58.657]  And I don't think it has anything to do with One Worldism.
[01:56:59.017 --> 01:57:01.658]  I think it has to do with the short term thinking
[01:57:22.029 --> 01:57:26.935]  Of CEOs who are themselves short term, and not many of them last very long.
[01:57:26.975 --> 01:57:27.436]  Well, stay there.
[01:57:27.456 --> 01:57:28.357]  We'll be back in one minute.
[01:57:28.377 --> 01:57:28.778]  Stay there.

[01:57:51.105 --> 01:57:51.906]  You want answers?
[01:57:52.686 --> 01:57:53.567]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:53.587 --> 01:57:57.890]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:58.431 --> 01:58:02.534]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:03.335 --> 01:58:09.339]  We have the former editor of the Wall Street Journal, Father of Reganomics, Dr. Paul Greg Robertson, will be with us into the end of the next segment.
[01:58:09.359 --> 01:58:11.361]  Appreciate him spending so much time with us today.
[01:58:12.572 --> 01:58:25.999]  And I'm going to get into the big environmental movement being funded by the neo-eugenicists openly calling for massive reductions in human population, more big developments on that front, a bunch of other economic news, and we'll also take some calls in the last 30 minutes if we have time.
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.681]  Dr. Roberts, this is a short segment, so is the next one.
[01:58:29.461 --> 01:58:33.603]  I was there questioning your view on what's happening in China.
[01:58:33.623 --> 01:58:34.244]  I mean, I agree
[01:58:35.164 --> 01:58:47.120]  From what I've studied, that it's certainly the short term by the CEOs adds to this frenzy and this, you know, eat, drink and be merry, tomorrow we die when the Chinese and the Japanese and others don't think like that.
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:49.082]  They think in decades and generations.
[01:58:50.043 --> 01:58:53.728]  But I'm going off what Globalist and the CFR put out.
[01:58:54.406 --> 01:58:56.287]  And they talk about the U.S.
[01:58:56.327 --> 01:59:03.830]  losing power being good, and they talk about it being divided up, and moving things to the third world, and how it helps them, and all this spin.
[01:59:04.590 --> 01:59:09.392]  But you seem to think that it's all driven by the make money today attitude.
[01:59:10.853 --> 01:59:21.738]  How do you put that together with the huge neoconservative Council on Foreign Relations push for American hegemony?
[01:59:23.536 --> 01:59:32.599]  Well, I put it together with... You can't simultaneously have the ruling class claiming hegemony over the world and destroying the basis of its hegemony.
[01:59:32.859 --> 01:59:34.340]  How do they tie their shoelaces then?
[01:59:34.360 --> 01:59:38.261]  I mean, either they're super smart or they're complete morons.
[01:59:38.321 --> 01:59:38.601]  Yeah.
[01:59:38.921 --> 01:59:46.344]  Well, I think that there's very little danger in them intentionally destroying their power base.
[01:59:47.233 --> 01:59:53.298]  There's a great deal of danger, and the fools doing it because they don't know the consequences of their actions.
[01:59:53.398 --> 01:59:57.361]  So you think it's mega-hubris, just insane, and arrogance?
[02:00:00.544 --> 02:00:02.445]  It's a drive for hegemony.
[02:00:04.006 --> 02:00:05.788]  The Romans had it.
[02:00:06.208 --> 02:00:12.233]  Some small part of the British had it for a while, and it was enough to create the British Empire.
[02:00:12.313 --> 02:00:16.256]  The French Jacobins had a form of it, the French Revolution.
[02:00:16.866 --> 02:00:21.648]  Leading to the Napoleonic Wars and the conquest of all of Europe.
[02:00:22.649 --> 02:00:32.173]  So these types of hegemonic drives appear, and in the United States, their home is the neoconservative ideology.
[02:00:34.094 --> 02:00:38.216]  So I think that that is a danger.
[02:00:38.396 --> 02:00:42.578]  In fact, in my opinion, it's a greater danger than some kind of a one-world plot.
[02:00:42.898 --> 02:00:46.100]  So regardless of what's driving and behind it, we're in deep trouble?
[02:00:46.627 --> 02:00:47.848]  We're in trouble.
[02:00:47.888 --> 02:00:49.108]  We agree on that.
[02:00:49.829 --> 02:01:09.140]  And all I was explaining is that I think we can more easily address it if we see that it's the product of folly rather than, you know, very clever super humans who are bringing about some long brood plan of
[02:01:10.043 --> 02:01:15.967]  Alex, you have to remember that for the dollar to plunge, there has to be somewhere for people to go to get out of it.
[02:01:15.987 --> 02:01:17.507]  They have to be able to get out of it.
[02:01:35.314 --> 02:01:37.555]  How bad do they want to get out of it?
[02:01:37.635 --> 02:01:41.076]  Are they willing to pay $1.50 for a euro?
[02:01:41.116 --> 02:01:43.876]  Are they willing to pay $2?
[02:01:45.737 --> 02:01:48.418]  Are they willing to pay $3 for a British Pound?
[02:01:50.038 --> 02:01:58.520]  And so it may be that at some point those prices of those currencies become unbelievable.
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:02:01.441]  So it's not always easy
[02:02:02.355 --> 02:02:07.298]  To get out of the dollar, particularly since it's not a really good alternative.
[02:02:07.919 --> 02:02:13.603]  The Euro itself, as I said, it doesn't really have a European state.
[02:02:15.504 --> 02:02:19.266]  And not only that, they also suffer from offshoring.
[02:02:19.727 --> 02:02:20.667]  No, absolutely.
[02:02:21.168 --> 02:02:22.749]  Stay there, Dr. Paul Kirk Roberts.
[02:02:22.809 --> 02:02:24.230]  Final segment with you.
[02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:25.571]  Appreciate all your time.
[02:02:25.611 --> 02:02:26.832]  I want to get into the two articles.
[02:02:26.872 --> 02:02:28.733]  You did one about the tasering and now a new one.
[02:02:29.683 --> 02:02:37.151]  dealing with police brutality and I want to shift gears into that subject and get your historical perspective on that.
[02:02:37.191 --> 02:02:39.073]  We really appreciate him joining us today.
[02:02:39.453 --> 02:02:40.955]  PrisonPlanet.com is the website.

[02:03:04.776 --> 02:03:14.120]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:03:14.380 --> 02:03:17.881]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:03:48.117 --> 02:03:50.039]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:50.439 --> 02:03:58.046]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:03:58.757 --> 02:04:05.820]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:06.220 --> 02:04:17.665]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:17.945 --> 02:04:21.607]  Terror Storm is a definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:21.907 --> 02:04:23.868]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:24.188 --> 02:04:28.030]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:33.571 --> 02:05:33.852]  That's 1-800-894-3596.
[02:05:42.136 --> 02:05:47.739]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:06:08.928]  Well, we've kept Dr. Roberts into the second hour because we've been getting into the economics of the world and we can debate about why they're doing it, their exact motivations, but we know they're globalists, we know they want one world government, we know they've got a lot of hubris, so we can debate all day why they're doing it.
[02:06:09.368 --> 02:06:10.829]  The fact is we know it is happening.
[02:06:11.445 --> 02:06:21.051]  But we were just talking, Dr. Roberts, and you were getting into hubris, and I saw a Haratz article yesterday with a big Tel Aviv professor.
[02:06:21.111 --> 02:06:25.074]  I saw another article out of Israel with one of their connections saying, look, the U.S.
[02:06:25.134 --> 02:06:25.734]  is plunging.
[02:06:25.754 --> 02:06:26.755]  Their dollar's falling.
[02:06:26.775 --> 02:06:29.276]  Our neocon strategy has failed.
[02:06:29.296 --> 02:06:31.057]  And by the way, one of these guys was a neocon.
[02:06:31.457 --> 02:06:33.439]  He said the world now totally hates us.
[02:06:33.899 --> 02:06:35.380]  We're going to be a banana republic.
[02:06:37.374 --> 02:06:39.916]  There were discussions about Sarkozy's A Paper Tiger.
[02:06:40.397 --> 02:06:43.459]  So Israel's even writing articles about, hey, we're in trouble.
[02:06:43.499 --> 02:06:49.164]  I think they're starting to realize things didn't go well on the Eastern Front, as you were just alluding to during the break.
[02:06:50.085 --> 02:06:55.649]  But the people inside the Knesset, the people inside, I think Downing Street's backed off a bit, aren't as arrogant.
[02:06:56.410 --> 02:06:59.893]  But right now in the White House, they're just more arrogant than ever.
[02:07:00.193 --> 02:07:02.115]  And you were talking about that psychology, Dr. Roberts.
[02:07:03.451 --> 02:07:22.238]  Okay, you know, if you are the President, and you're in the White House, and every time you walk by people snap to attention, and the Secret Service is guarding you, and everybody's spawning all over you, and you lose your judgment.
[02:07:22.298 --> 02:07:27.740]  You become so full of self-importance and hubris that
[02:07:29.042 --> 02:07:32.863]  You think you're infallible and that you're invulnerable and all the rest.
[02:07:32.903 --> 02:07:36.464]  Now you see, that doesn't happen to everybody.
[02:07:36.504 --> 02:07:38.785]  I don't think that happened to Ronald Reagan.
[02:07:40.346 --> 02:07:43.106]  And I don't think it happened to Jimmy Carter.
[02:07:44.367 --> 02:07:47.628]  But it certainly happened to George W. Bush.
[02:07:47.968 --> 02:07:51.269]  It appears to have happened to Richard Nixon and to LBJ.
[02:07:52.509 --> 02:07:57.911]  So if you're of a certain personality type, you lose all sense of proportion.
[02:07:59.033 --> 02:08:01.614]  And that's what we have with the guy there now.
[02:08:02.375 --> 02:08:04.215]  Well, talk about Reagan, because he's just interesting.
[02:08:04.275 --> 02:08:07.137]  I mean, you knew him, and of course you were in the government at that time.
[02:08:07.797 --> 02:08:09.498]  What was Ronald Reagan like behind the scenes?
[02:08:10.358 --> 02:08:22.043]  Well, you have to remember, Reagan was born before our time, and he grew up in a time that's gone, and it's hard for us to understand that, and the people that it produced.
[02:08:22.784 --> 02:08:27.426]  And we try to understand them in our terms, and it doesn't really work.
[02:08:29.022 --> 02:08:41.351]  Reagan wasn't full of himself, but he was full of respect for the Constitution, for the office of the Presidency, but not him as President.
[02:08:41.411 --> 02:08:46.154]  He never went into the Oval Office without a suit and tie.
[02:08:49.317 --> 02:08:56.101]  It was just a sign of his respect that this office is America, it ain't me.
[02:08:58.809 --> 02:09:03.493]  And so those kind of people I think are gone.
[02:09:03.553 --> 02:09:09.558]  Most people today, if they get something, they want to flaunt it, you know, and associate it with them personally in some way.
[02:09:09.578 --> 02:09:19.986]  Well, Bush just drips with arrogant hubris and snickering... Well, you have to understand, this was the no-good failure who never made good.
[02:09:20.787 --> 02:09:21.588]  Now he's president.
[02:09:22.909 --> 02:09:25.531]  I mean, you know, this is the guy who never could
[02:09:26.092 --> 02:09:26.932]  Do anything right.
[02:09:27.032 --> 02:09:29.493]  I mean, not even his National Guard service.
[02:09:29.553 --> 02:09:33.094]  So, um, you know, his businesses.
[02:09:33.194 --> 02:09:37.015]  I mean, he's always being bailed out by his dad or some friends of his dad.
[02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:42.957]  And, uh, so, and not only, and not only now is he president, but he's independent of his dad.
[02:09:44.077 --> 02:09:49.419]  You know, he doesn't listen to his father's advice or to his father's advisor's advice.
[02:09:49.659 --> 02:09:51.719]  All these people would have kept him out of this trouble.
[02:09:51.739 --> 02:09:54.160]  But so he's, he's just a,
[02:09:55.643 --> 02:09:58.485]  He wasn't fit to be in the office.
[02:09:59.186 --> 02:10:00.727]  But we were going to talk about police brutality.
[02:10:00.747 --> 02:10:01.628]  Sure, we've got a few minutes.
[02:10:01.648 --> 02:10:03.189]  Let's get into the last two articles you've done.
[02:10:03.610 --> 02:10:08.173]  Well, I don't... Well, I mean, you did one on the guy getting tasered, and then the other one.
[02:10:08.193 --> 02:10:10.295]  But just, I mean, any areas you want to discuss?
[02:10:10.875 --> 02:10:16.700]  Well, in the one today, I discussed it in a general sense.
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:21.544]  And I say that America's police brutality has become a pandemic.
[02:10:22.378 --> 02:10:29.702]  And I actually referenced the selection of the most outrageous recent cases that you have up on Prison Planet as videos.
[02:10:30.583 --> 02:10:42.330]  And what we've seen happen is that police brutality has crossed the line between using excessive force against a resisting Rodney King, for example.
[02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:43.730]  I mean, he did resist.
[02:10:45.591 --> 02:10:49.974]  But it's crossed the line from using excessive force against people who resist
[02:10:50.798 --> 02:10:53.180]  To using it against people who don't resist.
[02:10:53.761 --> 02:11:00.147]  The elderly, women, students, even public officials.
[02:11:00.187 --> 02:11:10.096]  The other day, a city councilman in Indiana, I think it was, pushed the ground and
[02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:13.952]  Beaten the head with a billy stick and hospitalized.
[02:11:14.372 --> 02:11:14.952]  I interviewed him.
[02:11:14.992 --> 02:11:16.453]  They did attack him from behind.
[02:11:16.474 --> 02:11:16.974]  Yeah.
[02:11:17.654 --> 02:11:18.575]  And they admit they did.
[02:11:18.615 --> 02:11:22.058]  And then they charged him for them attacking him from behind.
[02:11:22.338 --> 02:11:22.578]  Yeah.
[02:11:22.918 --> 02:11:24.400]  And that's another point I make.
[02:11:24.460 --> 02:11:32.666]  They always charge their victims because that then provides an excuse for what they did.
[02:11:35.188 --> 02:11:39.031]  There's absolutely no way to hold these people accountable.
[02:11:39.151 --> 02:11:40.392]  Usually, they get off.
[02:11:42.073 --> 02:11:43.274]  But they should be arrested.
[02:11:43.314 --> 02:11:48.855]  When a police officer assaults someone, that's assault.
[02:11:48.935 --> 02:11:50.676]  That is a crime.
[02:11:50.716 --> 02:11:52.817]  The police have no right to assault people.
[02:11:53.797 --> 02:11:57.258]  They're not allowed any more than you are allowed.
[02:11:58.478 --> 02:12:02.760]  Well, Dr. Roberts, according to the Founding Fathers, isn't it worse when someone in authority does something?
[02:12:03.614 --> 02:12:04.075]  Isn't it what?
[02:12:04.575 --> 02:12:13.903]  Isn't it, according to the Founding Fathers, worse when someone in authority does something because they did it in that office, and there's that greater tyrannical danger?
[02:12:15.104 --> 02:12:18.827]  Yes, of course, and it also discredits the office.
[02:12:21.670 --> 02:12:29.777]  But, you see, the day police attack Americans in university libraries, remember the UCLA student who's tasered for no reason?
[02:12:30.445 --> 02:12:34.526]  Except that he's studying in the library and he didn't have his ID card.
[02:12:34.586 --> 02:12:35.606]  And then he couldn't get up.
[02:12:35.646 --> 02:12:37.826]  They're shocking him seconds after they already shocked him.
[02:12:37.866 --> 02:12:38.626]  He can't get up.
[02:12:39.167 --> 02:12:40.847]  They're saying get up, but he can't get up.
[02:12:41.627 --> 02:12:45.268]  I think he was actually walking out when they grabbed him and began tasering him.
[02:12:45.548 --> 02:12:50.388]  Yes sir, but then, but then seconds after tasering, he can't get up because he's electrocuted.
[02:12:50.408 --> 02:12:53.509]  We know that this is unjustified brutality.
[02:12:53.689 --> 02:12:57.490]  And the question is, why, why is it going on?
[02:12:57.530 --> 02:12:58.450]  And it's everywhere.
[02:12:58.490 --> 02:12:59.630]  I mean, I mentioned a lot of it.
[02:13:00.316 --> 02:13:01.237]  A lot of the cases.
[02:13:01.917 --> 02:13:13.764]  And I think it's going on because the Bush administration has made it clear that it doesn't protect the Constitution or civil liberties.
[02:13:13.844 --> 02:13:23.550]  In fact, the main accomplishment of the Bush administration has been to attack the Constitution and destroy civil liberties.
[02:13:23.610 --> 02:13:29.934]  So then why should local police respect them when they see the Attorney General of the United States, the President, the Vice President,
[02:13:30.444 --> 02:13:37.546]  They don't defend civil liberties, so the police feel they have an open court.
[02:13:37.726 --> 02:13:49.289]  And as you know, Doctor, in Asia and in Africa, dictators are now attacking peaceful monks, and saying no free speech zones, and doing this saying, hey, America does it!
[02:13:49.990 --> 02:13:58.472]  Yeah, well we do do it, and it's because the police attract people with authoritarian personalities.
[02:13:59.452 --> 02:14:03.733]  You know, the police don't attract nice, reasonable people.
[02:14:03.753 --> 02:14:04.754]  They attract bullies.
[02:14:05.114 --> 02:14:07.895]  People who have authoritarian personalities.
[02:14:07.995 --> 02:14:12.456]  And they can't wait to use their authority.
[02:14:12.496 --> 02:14:13.917]  They want to use it.
[02:14:14.937 --> 02:14:22.679]  And so, even if you're going to comply with them, they get kind of disappointed that you don't resist.
[02:14:22.719 --> 02:14:23.580]  They beat you up anyhow.
[02:14:25.273 --> 02:14:31.458]  We also have the law and order conservatives who are always making apologies for police brutality.
[02:14:31.958 --> 02:14:32.319]  Always!
[02:14:32.419 --> 02:14:42.347]  Even in the case of the councilman who was beaten up that you interviewed, when the local TV put it online, what did the public think?
[02:14:43.447 --> 02:14:46.310]  About 27% said, well, he got what he deserved.
[02:14:46.930 --> 02:14:51.614]  So there's always a minority of authoritarians in the population
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:53.341]  Protect the police.
[02:14:53.381 --> 02:14:57.724]  But don't they understand in the end it's going to destroy the office and the name of the good cops?
[02:14:57.905 --> 02:14:59.626]  Because there are the types that get in to be bullies.
[02:14:59.666 --> 02:15:00.967]  There's also... It already has, Alex.
[02:15:01.468 --> 02:15:06.972]  You should see all the emails I have from policemen who've left the service because they said they can't take it.
[02:15:07.653 --> 02:15:13.638]  And they also say that the police are so corrupt that an honest cop is in danger if he's on the force.
[02:15:14.498 --> 02:15:17.581]  Because the corrupt ones can't stand him and they set him up.
[02:15:18.522 --> 02:15:19.783]  So, it's already
[02:15:20.600 --> 02:15:30.643]  Happened, and we're getting now, essentially, not only authoritarians, but criminals, who behave criminally in the police force.
[02:15:30.703 --> 02:15:43.808]  And then we have the law that the Law and Order Conservatives passed that makes it a serious felony with a long prison sentence for assaulting a police officer.
[02:15:44.733 --> 02:15:46.695]  So what does it mean to assault a police officer?
[02:15:46.715 --> 02:15:49.717]  It doesn't mean you come up to a guy and knock him upside the head.
[02:15:49.777 --> 02:15:53.420]  It means if he's starting to beat your brains out with a belly club.
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:55.962]  And you raise your hand to block, they charge.
[02:15:56.682 --> 02:15:58.364]  And you defend yourself.
[02:15:58.584 --> 02:16:13.736]  Or if you disarm him, maybe you're Mike Tyson's or maybe you're a karate martial artist and you take the nightstick away from him and say, no, if his backup hasn't already shot you dead,
[02:16:14.625 --> 02:16:17.806]  You'll be arrested for assaulting the police.
[02:16:17.946 --> 02:16:24.309]  Well, I see the reports of like, blind 94-year-old women getting beat up because the cop says get up and she can't hear him.
[02:16:25.769 --> 02:16:27.170]  Yeah, they beat up anybody.
[02:16:27.190 --> 02:16:29.991]  You know, you may have it on your prison planet.
[02:16:30.031 --> 02:16:32.272]  Just the other day, there was a 70-year-old woman.
[02:16:32.312 --> 02:16:34.673]  They beat her up because she hadn't worn her lock.
[02:16:36.054 --> 02:16:41.796]  So, they beat up people all the time, but what you notice is
[02:16:42.605 --> 02:16:44.126]  The witnesses just stand there.
[02:16:44.146 --> 02:16:45.066]  They don't interfere.
[02:16:45.266 --> 02:16:46.267]  They don't do anything.
[02:16:47.467 --> 02:16:49.828]  And everybody says, oh, let the police handle it.
[02:16:49.848 --> 02:16:55.631]  When they were beating the councilman unconscious, the other city councilman just stood there.
[02:16:57.252 --> 02:16:58.832]  They could have ordered the police off.
[02:16:59.272 --> 02:17:02.654]  They stood there and some stupid woman said, oh, let the police handle it.
[02:17:03.434 --> 02:17:11.418]  So people, Americans, are so differential now to authority that even the concept
[02:17:12.017 --> 02:17:17.138]  of self-defense or of stopping these types of brutal actions.
[02:17:17.158 --> 02:17:17.959]  They don't even have it.
[02:17:17.999 --> 02:17:19.199]  It's not even in their head.
[02:17:19.339 --> 02:17:22.240]  Well, sir, I've already kept you 20 minutes over the time you had to leave.
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:23.380]  We got a three-minute break.
[02:17:23.620 --> 02:17:25.060]  I don't want to twist your arm.
[02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:29.762]  Do you want to talk about solutions to the police or is this the end of the interview?
[02:17:30.642 --> 02:17:33.182]  I think that we can let it go.
[02:17:33.263 --> 02:17:36.723]  Just remember, years ago, New York wanted to have civilian review boards.
[02:17:37.023 --> 02:17:37.404]  Stay there.
[02:17:37.444 --> 02:17:37.824]  We got it.
[02:17:37.884 --> 02:17:38.144]  Hold on.
[02:17:38.164 --> 02:17:38.944]  Let me talk to you during the break.

[02:19:31.705 --> 02:19:35.728]  The value of your hard-earned money is being lost in a global game of chess.
[02:19:35.828 --> 02:19:37.749]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:19:37.829 --> 02:19:40.751]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:41.871 --> 02:19:47.355]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:19:47.795 --> 02:19:52.037]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:19:52.458 --> 02:19:59.322]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:19:59.742 --> 02:20:06.446]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:20:06.767 --> 02:20:08.388]  There are no reported side effects.

[02:20:41.730 --> 02:20:44.673]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:20:44.833 --> 02:20:50.058]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:20:50.358 --> 02:20:55.623]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:20:56.063 --> 02:20:57.184]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:20:57.545 --> 02:21:06.513]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:21:06.853 --> 02:21:08.475]  Now compare a cowbend pure soap.

[02:21:42.348 --> 02:21:46.571]  Body Union's our big business man.
[02:21:46.991 --> 02:21:49.694]  And it's going down like a dinosaur.
[02:21:57.485 --> 02:22:01.147]  Oh, I'm flattered.
[02:22:01.167 --> 02:22:12.893]  It's a story for LewRockwell.com and he sourced PrisonPlanet.com's new police brutality epidemic section we built.
[02:22:15.094 --> 02:22:16.134]  I appreciate that.
[02:22:16.174 --> 02:22:17.955]  Dr. Roberts is real sweet to me on there.
[02:22:17.975 --> 02:22:23.378]  He's always getting mad at me on there because he likes to make his points and he talks like an old turtle.
[02:22:24.504 --> 02:22:25.525]  It takes his time.
[02:22:26.465 --> 02:22:29.447]  But I've always got these breaks up ahead of me.
[02:22:30.107 --> 02:22:31.187]  But he's a really good guy.
[02:22:31.428 --> 02:22:32.848]  And he knows about the One World Government.
[02:22:32.888 --> 02:22:33.929]  He's talked about that on air.
[02:22:33.969 --> 02:22:35.069]  He knows they're doing that.
[02:22:35.630 --> 02:22:39.992]  He just can't believe they'd want to destroy the country, and he can't believe how sophisticated it is.
[02:22:40.752 --> 02:22:41.332]  But I'm sorry.
[02:22:41.372 --> 02:22:44.054]  I've got David Rockefeller's own documents, Kissinger's, all of it.
[02:22:44.114 --> 02:22:45.694]  They talk about the instability.
[02:22:46.014 --> 02:22:48.136]  They talk about how the CEOs are running wild.
[02:22:48.176 --> 02:22:49.176]  They're below them.
[02:22:49.536 --> 02:22:51.097]  See, they're the capital above them.
[02:22:52.117 --> 02:22:55.098]  And yeah, what happens when there's nobody to buy the products from China?
[02:22:55.138 --> 02:22:56.558]  Well, they just sell to other people then.
[02:22:56.918 --> 02:23:01.219]  It's all about bringing down the U.S., blowing out the economy, consolidating everything.
[02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:05.540]  You notice on every front they're doing whatever hurts Americans.
[02:23:06.381 --> 02:23:20.204]  And I want to be clear, every time we get into the police being out of control, and I'm sorry, a deaf and blind woman, 94, being beaten because the cop's so dumb he thinks she won't get up, it's illegal to taser or beat somebody because they won't get up or do what you say.
[02:23:21.292 --> 02:23:24.033]  See, that's now called resisting.
[02:23:24.093 --> 02:23:26.154]  Or taser somebody because they won't give a urine sample.
[02:23:26.194 --> 02:23:28.374]  Or taser somebody because they've chained themselves to something.
[02:23:28.575 --> 02:23:29.795]  That's called torture, Bubba.
[02:23:31.275 --> 02:23:37.538]  Now, I know there are other people who joined the police force, not because they're authoritarians, but because they were soldiers, and that's what they do now.
[02:23:38.278 --> 02:23:39.758]  Or their daddy was a cop.
[02:23:39.878 --> 02:23:42.459]  I mean, take Bob Dacey's son.
[02:23:42.739 --> 02:23:44.080]  He's down in Houston.
[02:23:44.540 --> 02:23:47.081]  Nice guy, big guy, football player type.
[02:23:48.019 --> 02:23:54.584]  I've noticed he's a little kid, he's not a bad guy, and he's got a guard dog attitude, or a sheep dog attitude.
[02:23:54.624 --> 02:23:55.965]  He wants to go after bad guys.
[02:23:56.425 --> 02:23:57.606]  I mean, I have that instinct.
[02:23:57.986 --> 02:23:58.667]  I'm not a bully.
[02:23:59.267 --> 02:24:00.828]  I like beating bullies up, actually.
[02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:05.031]  There's nothing like a bully starting something they can't finish, and they're crying when you're done with them.
[02:24:05.672 --> 02:24:07.253]  Bullies always cry when you're done with them.
[02:24:07.894 --> 02:24:10.515]  You get them on the ground, start kicking them upside the head, they start begging.
[02:24:11.656 --> 02:24:14.979]  But, or you start stomping their ribs in.
[02:24:15.039 --> 02:24:16.780]  I'm sorry, I'm getting off on a side issue.
[02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:42.994]  uh... but uh... he's not a bad cop he wants to be a guardian type and he went to the big law enforcement school out in east texas san houston state and the whole thing was we serve the united nations we serve the one world government i mean bob brought in the textbook point blank said constitutionalists are evil guns are bad in the people's hands we serve the new world order i mean it's just and he was like uh...
[02:24:43.777 --> 02:24:44.837]  Hey, Dad, look at this!
[02:24:45.257 --> 02:24:47.858]  He already knew all about it because we've been teaching him about it.
[02:24:47.898 --> 02:24:48.678]  He's not bad.
[02:24:48.698 --> 02:24:51.419]  I know all the cops aren't bad, but the system is bad.
[02:24:51.439 --> 02:24:54.220]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:25:02.602]  When you're in New York at a park videotaping an interview and the cops run up and threaten to beat your head in, that's not right, folks!
[02:25:03.922 --> 02:25:05.302]  And Dr. Roberts had to go.
[02:25:05.322 --> 02:25:06.263]  He had a meeting he had to go to.
[02:25:06.303 --> 02:25:08.063]  He was already late, but he wanted to tell people that
[02:25:08.897 --> 02:25:16.560]  He remembered back in the eighties all the police brutality in New York and William F. Buckley and all the fake conservatives were saying, oh no, you can't second-guess the police.
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:17.160]  Don't do that.
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:17.700]  Don't do that.
[02:25:17.740 --> 02:25:18.240]  Don't do that.
[02:25:19.801 --> 02:25:21.481]  That happened in Rome's decline.
[02:25:21.501 --> 02:25:29.444]  You get different groups of the provincial police in Rome who get out of control and start running all the corruption and just become mob bosses.
[02:25:29.924 --> 02:25:31.825]  And it even became a problem for higher-ups.
[02:25:32.445 --> 02:25:33.385]  I mean, that's history.
[02:25:33.425 --> 02:25:34.465]  That's human nature.
[02:25:35.706 --> 02:25:35.846]  And
[02:25:38.229 --> 02:25:41.070]  I mean, I had Austin cops a few months ago were out protesting.
[02:25:41.610 --> 02:25:48.854]  Perry treasonously going to Istanbul in violation of federal law for a secret meeting, governmental meeting.
[02:25:49.794 --> 02:25:50.874]  Ended up being in the newspaper.
[02:25:51.835 --> 02:25:52.955]  These just say it didn't exist.
[02:25:53.355 --> 02:25:57.457]  Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, Austin American Statesman, News 8, KI.
[02:25:59.318 --> 02:25:59.938]  So how's that?
[02:25:59.998 --> 02:26:03.159]  Now at least it's public and the cops walked up and said, we're going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[02:26:03.199 --> 02:26:04.360]  And I said, I don't need a permit.
[02:26:05.282 --> 02:26:10.306]  This isn't a free speech zone, that's all unconstitutional, and you know the state's been losing lawsuits over that officer.
[02:26:10.806 --> 02:26:12.647]  And he said, nevertheless, I'm going to arrest you if you don't leave.
[02:26:13.448 --> 02:26:14.068]  All on video.
[02:26:15.049 --> 02:26:19.852]  We haven't put that on the web yet, because I've got such big fish to fry, I'm not trying to make cops look bad.
[02:26:20.212 --> 02:26:21.613]  I just feel sorry for you, actually.
[02:26:23.615 --> 02:26:25.296]  I do, I'm not even trying to burn you.
[02:26:26.256 --> 02:26:29.459]  And then he walks over to the media and says, that's a lie, I didn't threaten to arrest anybody.
[02:26:31.340 --> 02:26:32.861]  Got you all on tape, lying.
[02:26:35.580 --> 02:26:45.268]  I mean, you're not the New World Order, but you're certainly carrying out what they're doing, and that's why Dr. Roberts is talking about this.
[02:26:46.889 --> 02:26:52.895]  And he was personal friends with Ronald Reagan, and father of Reaganomics, and at the White House every week, folks.
[02:26:53.095 --> 02:26:54.176]  This is not some liberal.
[02:26:54.496 --> 02:27:00.641]  I know cops think they're conservative and think they're Ronald Reaganites, and it's the opposite.
[02:27:02.322 --> 02:27:02.983]  It's the opposite.
[02:27:03.829 --> 02:27:04.950]  When you do that.
[02:27:05.410 --> 02:27:07.931]  I mean, cops get so mad when they pull me over and I want to search your car.
[02:27:07.951 --> 02:27:08.972]  And I'm like, no!
[02:27:09.412 --> 02:27:11.553]  And they get real mad and they go, look man, it's America!
[02:27:12.714 --> 02:27:13.715]  Well, what do you got to hide?
[02:27:13.815 --> 02:27:14.795]  Nothing, buddy!
[02:27:15.215 --> 02:27:16.396]  It's a free country!
[02:27:17.016 --> 02:27:19.218]  I don't have the drugs your bosses ship in!
[02:27:21.459 --> 02:27:25.161]  Now go get a drug dog and let's spend two hours here.
[02:27:26.342 --> 02:27:27.002]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:32.330 --> 02:27:33.270]  We're on the march.
[02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:35.451]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:36.251 --> 02:27:39.051]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.212 --> 02:27:44.592]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:27:45.132 --> 02:27:46.592]  After a pedicure they look great.
[02:27:46.952 --> 02:27:50.773]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:27:51.213 --> 02:27:53.414]  Haven't you heard about Kalex Ointment?
[02:27:53.834 --> 02:27:57.174]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:27:57.574 --> 02:28:00.035]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:28:00.535 --> 02:28:01.535]  What's that name again?
[02:28:01.980 --> 02:28:03.141]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:28:03.542 --> 02:28:04.703]  It's Calex.
[02:28:05.124 --> 02:28:06.946]  C-A-L-E-X.
[02:28:07.307 --> 02:28:09.149]  What makes Calex ointment so different?
[02:28:09.938 --> 02:28:18.560]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:24.702]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[02:28:25.102 --> 02:28:36.225]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:28:36.866 --> 02:28:37.967]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[02:28:38.307 --> 02:28:38.987]  I'll be right back.
[02:28:39.108 --> 02:28:40.849]  I'm getting some callots for my heels.
[02:28:43.330 --> 02:28:45.031]  Are you tired of frequent urination?
[02:28:45.452 --> 02:28:47.673]  Do you drink a ton of water and still feel thirsty?
[02:28:48.013 --> 02:28:51.075]  The quantity of water you drink is not the key to hydration.
[02:28:51.235 --> 02:28:54.197]  The key to hydration is the correct clustering of water.
[02:28:54.378 --> 02:28:57.880]  When water has the ideal cluster, your cells will readily absorb it.
[02:28:58.260 --> 02:28:59.121]  We're good to go.
[02:29:23.499 --> 02:29:23.979]  We're good to go.
[02:29:41.914 --> 02:29:42.454]  Hey, Emily!
[02:29:42.735 --> 02:29:43.575]  Wow, you look great!
[02:29:43.815 --> 02:29:44.636]  I feel great!
[02:29:44.856 --> 02:29:46.658]  I've been using MediCleanse Colon Cleanse.
[02:29:46.938 --> 02:29:47.238]  Really?
[02:29:47.458 --> 02:29:47.878]  What is it?
[02:29:48.099 --> 02:29:48.559]  How does it work?
[02:29:48.759 --> 02:29:55.344]  MediCleanse is a natural fiber therapy with ground flaxseed, psyllium, and bentonite clay that eliminates toxins from your body.
[02:29:55.504 --> 02:29:57.786]  MediCleanse is easy to use without being intrusive.
[02:29:57.986 --> 02:30:03.310]  You take two tablespoons of MediCleanse powder, mix with water or juice, drink, and it does all the work for you.
[02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:04.111]  That's it?
[02:30:04.411 --> 02:30:05.933]  It sounds so easy and convenient.
[02:30:06.193 --> 02:30:06.894]  It is easy.
[02:30:07.095 --> 02:30:13.803]  Plus the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[02:30:14.103 --> 02:30:15.605]  It helps with all of those ailments?
[02:30:15.926 --> 02:30:16.627]  That's amazing!
[02:30:17.047 --> 02:30:22.414]  And the bentonite clay and MediCleanse eliminates viruses and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[02:30:22.694 --> 02:30:23.014]  Well, how?
[02:30:23.234 --> 02:30:24.334]  Where can I buy MediCleanse?
[02:30:24.635 --> 02:30:27.455]  A one-month supply is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[02:30:27.555 --> 02:30:30.736]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com.
[02:30:30.876 --> 02:30:34.317]  For only $22.95 plus shipping, MediCleanse is shipped directly to you.

[02:30:35.477 --> 02:30:35.918]  Call today.
[02:30:53.817 --> 02:30:58.383]  Don't call my name out your window when I'm leaving.
[02:30:59.844 --> 02:31:02.247]  I won't even turn my head.
[02:31:04.730 --> 02:31:08.795]  Don't send your kinfolks to give me no talking.
[02:31:10.377 --> 02:31:12.539]  I'll be gone like I said.
[02:31:15.182 --> 02:31:20.146]  You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[02:31:20.166 --> 02:31:24.388]  Lay there in your bed and keep your mouth shut till I'm gone.
[02:31:25.029 --> 02:31:29.391]  Don't give me that old familiar cryin' cussin' moan.
[02:31:38.694 --> 02:31:40.074]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:40.634 --> 02:31:43.695]  Alright, I won't have time to hit a smattering of three or four tops.
[02:31:43.715 --> 02:31:45.295]  Of course, we haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:31:46.055 --> 02:31:49.516]  And to talk to Crystal, Chris, Anthony, and Cal.
[02:31:49.596 --> 02:31:50.736]  I'll take those five calls.
[02:31:51.376 --> 02:31:53.737]  All the time we're going to have, I'm going to hit a few other little issues here.
[02:31:55.997 --> 02:31:59.118]  Right now, I want to tell you about a wonderful sponsor, eFoods Direct.
[02:32:00.151 --> 02:32:00.852]  It's the website.
[02:32:00.892 --> 02:32:05.556]  It's the J. Michael Stevens Group, the oldest continual operating storable foods company in the nation.
[02:32:05.616 --> 02:32:11.521]  The meals are 50% bigger than what the government says a meal is.
[02:32:11.541 --> 02:32:12.382]  They're big meals.
[02:32:12.902 --> 02:32:14.184]  They're the highest quality.
[02:32:14.664 --> 02:32:16.946]  It's where I've chosen to get storable foods twice.
[02:32:17.987 --> 02:32:22.271]  They last more than 10 years when properly stored, but guaranteed to last 10 years.
[02:32:23.644 --> 02:32:26.325]  Give them a call and get a free brochure.
[02:32:26.966 --> 02:32:29.307]  Give them a call and order a two-month supply.
[02:32:29.347 --> 02:32:30.767]  They've got those for each person.
[02:32:30.807 --> 02:32:31.648]  Emergency supply.
[02:32:31.688 --> 02:32:35.890]  Two boxes that easily fit in the back of your trunk with room to spare.
[02:32:37.210 --> 02:32:39.271]  You should at least have the two-month emergency kit.
[02:32:39.791 --> 02:32:41.012]  They've got a bunch of other great items.
[02:32:41.052 --> 02:32:41.772]  Just give them a call.
[02:32:41.792 --> 02:32:43.213]  They're wonderful folks.
[02:32:43.233 --> 02:32:44.113]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:44.754 --> 02:32:47.735]  The criminals running our government have said they'll use food as a weapon.
[02:32:48.917 --> 02:32:51.658]  And there's going to be a depression or a recession or whatever.
[02:32:52.138 --> 02:32:53.659]  For college kids, this is great.
[02:32:54.219 --> 02:32:56.619]  For police, it's great to have at your station.
[02:32:56.699 --> 02:32:58.200]  I mean, everybody should have storable food.
[02:32:58.500 --> 02:32:59.760]  You're nuts if you don't.
[02:32:59.780 --> 02:32:59.940]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:59.980 --> 02:33:00.601]  Ants store food.
[02:33:00.621 --> 02:33:01.301]  Squirrels store food.
[02:33:05.817 --> 02:33:08.179]  Grasshoppers don't and they die when the winter comes.
[02:33:08.199 --> 02:33:16.924]  1-800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com or check out their banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:16.944 --> 02:33:19.466]  Just absolutely fabulous folks.
[02:33:20.327 --> 02:33:24.710]  Let's go ahead now and go to Debbie Morrow for about five minutes and I'm going right to your calls in the news.
[02:33:25.090 --> 02:33:26.371]  Hadn't had Debbie on in a while.
[02:33:26.471 --> 02:33:31.214]  Debbie, I guess about six, seven years ago they had the idea at New Millennium Concepts
[02:33:32.785 --> 02:33:34.406]  They were the national distributors.
[02:33:34.486 --> 02:33:37.967]  Anybody who got them in the US, they were the national distributor for British Barking.
[02:33:39.428 --> 02:33:44.709]  And they only sold to the camping supply places, and the military, and the missionaries, and big groups.
[02:33:45.930 --> 02:33:46.310]  In bulk.
[02:33:46.470 --> 02:33:53.833]  And they said, why don't we sell directly, this was about 8 or 9 years ago now, to the Patriot Movement, to the people that are preparedness folks.
[02:33:54.273 --> 02:33:56.514]  And so basically, you get a wholesale price.
[02:33:58.197 --> 02:34:02.619]  But if I bought like 20 of these, I think I'd get them for like $20, $30 cheaper than what they're selling them to you for.
[02:34:02.979 --> 02:34:03.620]  Let me give you an idea.
[02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:04.800]  That's the type of discount you're getting.
[02:34:05.201 --> 02:34:06.681]  You're getting near wholesale.
[02:34:07.442 --> 02:34:07.762]  Okay?
[02:34:07.822 --> 02:34:09.803]  I mean, buying one of these would be $300, $199.
[02:34:09.883 --> 02:34:13.245]  Buying one that's $249 would be $350.
[02:34:13.805 --> 02:34:17.607]  That's the type of discounts you're getting going directly to them.
[02:34:17.687 --> 02:34:22.989]  And they also make the American Berkey that university studies have shown is a new standard.
[02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:25.051]  Electron microscopes can find nothing.
[02:34:25.991 --> 02:34:27.072]  That's what we use in the office.
[02:34:27.172 --> 02:34:27.832]  Use it in my home.
[02:34:29.050 --> 02:34:33.372]  You know, because the kids like to go, and at night they don't want to go to the kitchen to get water.
[02:34:33.392 --> 02:34:34.793]  We've got one in the bathroom with a cup.
[02:34:34.833 --> 02:34:36.313]  That's what they drink of in the bathroom.
[02:34:36.733 --> 02:34:38.734]  And we've got two of them in the house at the office.
[02:34:39.294 --> 02:34:39.855]  They're everywhere.
[02:34:40.595 --> 02:34:44.717]  And it's what I believe in, and they're super discounted for Alex Jones listeners.
[02:34:44.977 --> 02:34:50.139]  You get a free gift, a sports bottle that's a filter, doesn't purify it, but cleans it, makes it safe to drink.
[02:34:51.812 --> 02:34:53.893]  The Berkeys are purifiers, the big ones.
[02:34:54.594 --> 02:34:58.837]  Potassium iodate, sheltering in place DVDs, prudent places DVD, free gifts.
[02:34:59.538 --> 02:35:02.881]  That's what you get for being our listeners when you give Debbie a call.
[02:35:03.181 --> 02:35:04.502]  Debbie, it's good to have you on with us.
[02:35:04.862 --> 02:35:06.984]  Hi there, thanks for having me.
[02:35:07.224 --> 02:35:19.254]  Well, thank you for coming on and thank you to Millennium is also the global sponsor, because I couldn't do it if it wasn't for them, of our six hours a day global outreach with WWCR, the biggest and best shortwave channel in the world.
[02:35:20.533 --> 02:35:38.168]  Well, we really love sponsoring you, Alex, and we believe in what you're doing there, and we appreciate all of your listeners who, you know, are working so hard to, you know, work on keeping America free and keeping their own free choice.
[02:35:38.268 --> 02:35:41.791]  And that's what we at Berkeywater are all about, is free choice.
[02:35:42.571 --> 02:35:49.197]  And one way that you can be, you know, sure that you're getting your good drinking water is to make your own.
[02:35:52.074 --> 02:36:00.150]  Well, I totally agree with you, and I was just here during the break, while you were talking, I was reading the headline on PrisonPlanet.com
[02:36:01.721 --> 02:36:09.243]  Where all these elitists, all these children's cartoons, all these programs are saying we're a virus, we've got to kill off the humans, humans are bad.
[02:36:09.543 --> 02:36:11.363]  We know the government's run by eugenicists.
[02:36:11.763 --> 02:36:18.725]  Why would we trust them to drink the fluoride, the arsenic, the lead, the mercury, the dead bacteria that are in the water?
[02:36:18.805 --> 02:36:20.385]  You see, the water only kills those.
[02:36:21.145 --> 02:36:24.746]  The fluoride and... Well, the fluoride doesn't do that.
[02:36:24.806 --> 02:36:27.727]  The chlorine only kills those bacteria.
[02:36:28.587 --> 02:36:29.267]  Why then
[02:36:30.861 --> 02:36:32.102]  Do we still drink them?
[02:36:32.142 --> 02:36:37.966]  I mean, again, that's why bladder cancer and kidney cancer and urethra cancer is all off the charts now.
[02:36:38.787 --> 02:36:40.448]  There's thousands of things in the water.
[02:36:40.828 --> 02:36:44.951]  I believe passionately in these products, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:36:45.532 --> 02:36:47.013]  Again, they're sponsors of the show.
[02:36:47.113 --> 02:36:48.193]  It's a discounted price.
[02:36:48.233 --> 02:36:50.775]  They've got the highest quality American and British.
[02:36:50.835 --> 02:36:52.817]  Lexan, stainless steel, whatever you want.
[02:36:53.097 --> 02:36:53.937]  It's discounted.
[02:36:55.496 --> 02:37:01.468]  It's a great deal and it stops them from being able to hit you with their main system of poison.
[02:37:01.528 --> 02:37:07.059]  Now, before you were ever a sponsor five, six years ago, I bought from you guys shower filters.
[02:37:08.120 --> 02:37:12.045]  And then just a year ago I thought, I've had this for three years, I'm supposed to replace this.
[02:37:12.145 --> 02:37:14.428]  Even I forget and I got new ones from you.
[02:37:14.788 --> 02:37:21.037]  Your elements are about three times the size of some I bought before I had you guys as sponsors at Home Depot.
[02:37:21.538 --> 02:37:25.403]  Why are the elements, what's the difference in the shower filters you sell and what's at Home Depot?
[02:37:26.463 --> 02:37:32.727]  Well, you know, I don't know what's at Home Depot so much, but our shower filters are really, really fantastic.
[02:37:33.727 --> 02:37:50.175]  The media that's inside the shower filters will actually reduce the chlorine up to 95%, but it turns the chlorine into like an inert product and makes it go away down the drain.
[02:37:50.595 --> 02:37:51.916]  Now, they don't touch fluoride.
[02:37:51.976 --> 02:37:53.417]  Unfortunately, there isn't any
[02:37:53.977 --> 02:37:59.620]  There's a lot of product out there that we're aware of in a shower filter that will touch, you know, the fluoride.
[02:38:01.301 --> 02:38:04.863]  The filter is really easy to install.
[02:38:04.883 --> 02:38:08.105]  You don't have to change out any plumbing normally.
[02:38:09.266 --> 02:38:16.590]  Sometimes you might need to use a little pliers thing to loosen up your shower head or some little tape, you know, water tape.
[02:38:16.730 --> 02:38:17.950]  I mean, it's really great.
[02:38:19.352 --> 02:38:28.138]  The KDF media that's in them works kind of like a catalytic converter does in your automobile, you know?
[02:38:28.738 --> 02:38:41.586]  It keeps you from getting all of that... And even if you take a bath, even if you take a bath, all you do is run the hose up, you know, put that type of attachment on it, you know, it's got the hose sprayer, and then you just fill the tub up that way.
[02:38:41.926 --> 02:38:44.008]  If you love your children, folks, they're inhaling
[02:38:44.708 --> 02:38:50.174]  All the trihalomethanes and toxins that are in the water, they're breathing all of this garbage.
[02:38:50.575 --> 02:38:52.077]  Believe me, I used it.
[02:38:52.177 --> 02:38:53.558]  Believe me, I looked into it.
[02:38:54.059 --> 02:38:55.641]  Don't let them drink the poison water.
[02:38:55.781 --> 02:38:56.662]  Don't let them breathe it.
[02:38:56.882 --> 02:38:58.243]  Your skin is the biggest organ.
[02:38:58.364 --> 02:38:59.525]  It also absorbs it.
[02:38:59.985 --> 02:39:04.270]  If you care about your family, you better start using these now.
[02:39:07.092 --> 02:39:07.693]  888-803-4438.
[02:39:07.713 --> 02:39:10.614]  888-803-4438.
[02:39:10.935 --> 02:39:11.735]  Give her a call.
[02:39:11.755 --> 02:39:12.816]  888-803-4438.
[02:39:13.936 --> 02:39:17.719]  Or go to InfoWars.com, the secure online shopping cart.
[02:39:17.959 --> 02:39:19.039]  The orders come in every day.
[02:39:19.079 --> 02:39:20.200]  We fax them over to Debbie.
[02:39:20.580 --> 02:39:21.861]  She ships them out to you.
[02:39:22.081 --> 02:39:24.403]  She gives them to their shipping department at the warehouse.
[02:39:25.223 --> 02:39:29.686]  Again, InfoWars.com, secure online shopping cart and video and bookstore.
[02:39:30.586 --> 02:39:34.329]  Right there at Infowars.com or 888-803-4438.
[02:39:34.690 --> 02:39:37.332]  In the comments section, tell us what free gift you want.
[02:39:37.652 --> 02:39:42.656]  Same thing at Berkeywater.com, exact same place, order from them, exact same prices, exact same products.
[02:39:42.916 --> 02:39:48.260]  Do you still have those little $35 value LED flashlights you're throwing in as free gifts?
[02:39:48.740 --> 02:39:49.241]  We do.
[02:39:49.301 --> 02:39:54.925]  If somebody wants the flashlight, they can get that or they can get the Berkey Sport bottles or Potassium Iodate.
[02:39:55.365 --> 02:40:01.249]  And the one thing, Alex, I really want to talk to everybody about, don't wait for the holiday rush because we're already in it.
[02:40:01.969 --> 02:40:22.541]  I mean, we're at the end of summer and the calls are coming in just furiously and if people want to get these for whatever reason, holiday presents, whatever reason, you've been sitting around thinking about getting one, I'm telling you, get your orders in because it is taking us a little bit longer to get shipping out now because we're getting busier and busier.
[02:40:23.482 --> 02:40:23.742]  888-803-4438.
[02:40:25.945 --> 02:40:26.886]  Berkeywater.com.
[02:40:26.926 --> 02:40:28.027]  Infowars.com.
[02:40:28.287 --> 02:40:29.268]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[02:40:29.609 --> 02:40:30.430]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:40:30.490 --> 02:40:32.252]  Y'all have a great day and love you guys.
[02:40:32.512 --> 02:40:32.913]  You bet.
[02:40:33.113 --> 02:40:38.499]  And folks, if you aren't going to buy water filters from them who are sponsors at lower prices, highest quality, fine.
[02:40:38.619 --> 02:40:38.799]  Don't.
[02:40:39.600 --> 02:40:41.041]  Just get a high-quality filter.
[02:40:41.402 --> 02:40:48.988]  And I'm going to tell you, a $50 charcoal filter takes out some of the dead bacteria and a little bit of chlorine bound to them.
[02:40:49.448 --> 02:40:50.969]  It does not cut out the fluoride.
[02:40:51.009 --> 02:40:52.390]  It does not cut out the arsenic.
[02:40:52.430 --> 02:40:53.671]  It does not cut out the lead.
[02:40:54.192 --> 02:40:54.952]  It does nothing.
[02:40:55.353 --> 02:41:01.317]  And if you've got a two, three-year-old cheap filter, even an expensive one, hooked up to your sink, it's more poisonous.
[02:41:01.337 --> 02:41:01.958]  Let me explain.
[02:41:02.358 --> 02:41:03.179]  It builds up
[02:41:03.954 --> 02:41:06.816]  And then when it starts breaking down, you get masses of it.
[02:41:06.956 --> 02:41:08.557]  Replace old filters.
[02:41:08.938 --> 02:41:10.138]  I care about my listeners.
[02:41:10.539 --> 02:41:12.080]  I get off on helping people.
[02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:14.001]  That's just how I operate.
[02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:15.682]  That's why I feel good about myself.
[02:41:16.002 --> 02:41:16.963]  Life is just too good.
[02:41:17.604 --> 02:41:18.324]  Oh, I just love it.
[02:41:18.604 --> 02:41:21.566]  You see, I'm not one of these decadent yuppies that's unhappy, folks.
[02:41:21.847 --> 02:41:23.207]  I'm telling you, you can be happy too.
[02:41:23.288 --> 02:41:24.769]  Start trying to be a good guy.
[02:41:25.389 --> 02:41:28.131]  But that doesn't mean have your energies misdirected into evil.
[02:41:28.931 --> 02:41:32.714]  Because if you're doing evil, even if you think it's good, you're not going to get that same feeling.
[02:41:32.734 --> 02:41:34.055]  I'm telling you, it's a spiritual thing.
[02:41:34.415 --> 02:41:37.378]  You've got to be helping people, and when you help others, it helps you!
[02:41:37.718 --> 02:41:37.918]  See?
[02:41:38.098 --> 02:41:39.740]  You help yourself, and it helps the show!
[02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:42.442]  I'm telling you, get the Berkeys!
[02:41:42.462 --> 02:41:43.182]  888-803-4438.
[02:41:43.282 --> 02:41:45.544]  I'm out of control.
[02:41:45.564 --> 02:41:46.765]  Alright, who's up first here?
[02:41:46.785 --> 02:41:47.826]  I'm going to go to your calls right now.
[02:41:47.866 --> 02:41:48.426]  Who's up first?
[02:41:49.787 --> 02:41:50.888]  Crystal in Missouri.
[02:41:50.968 --> 02:41:51.809]  Crystal in Missouri.
[02:41:51.829 --> 02:41:52.870]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[02:41:52.890 --> 02:41:54.011]  Yeah, hi.
[02:41:54.391 --> 02:41:56.993]  Um, I'm, you know, Independence is Germantown.
[02:41:57.013 --> 02:41:58.114]  I don't know if you've been there.
[02:41:58.891 --> 02:42:00.192]  But what's the topic?
[02:42:00.252 --> 02:42:01.493]  Anything I can say, right?
[02:42:02.494 --> 02:42:04.355]  Pardon me, I'm going to be frank with you.
[02:42:04.375 --> 02:42:05.035]  Maybe I'm dumb.
[02:42:05.315 --> 02:42:06.516]  I'm not understanding what you're saying.
[02:42:07.337 --> 02:42:09.498]  Well, the topic, you can say anything you want.
[02:42:09.558 --> 02:42:10.799]  Ask any questions today.
[02:42:10.919 --> 02:42:11.360]  Yes, ma'am.
[02:42:11.780 --> 02:42:18.084]  Yeah, well, way back, you know, when we adopted Hawaii, you know, they didn't tell us about that.
[02:42:18.124 --> 02:42:19.065]  We didn't have to say so.
[02:42:19.125 --> 02:42:25.489]  And I think late night radio, they're saying that the Mexicans are merging over and I believe that'll happen.
[02:42:25.509 --> 02:42:26.350]  Do you agree with that?
[02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:40.363]  Yes, just like Hawaii, they went and killed the Queen's Guard and put her at gunpoint and took it, the globalists are using the illegal aliens, and they say this, to create the North American Union and overrun the U.S.
[02:42:40.603 --> 02:42:41.923]  where it's no longer the U.S.
[02:42:42.543 --> 02:42:44.103]  Yep, I think that'll happen.
[02:42:44.363 --> 02:42:46.244]  Oh, that's probably stated by the CFR, yes.
[02:42:46.484 --> 02:42:50.084]  Because there's already a third here, and of course that's been going on for 30 years.
[02:42:50.765 --> 02:42:52.485]  But why do they keep talking about the
[02:42:53.483 --> 02:42:59.046]  Uh, electrical wiring under and building the bridges and building the wall higher.
[02:42:59.106 --> 02:43:07.090]  It's just another part of the religion lies or something that the government's trying to tell us, I guess.
[02:43:07.170 --> 02:43:07.670]  I don't know.
[02:43:09.111 --> 02:43:21.117]  I'm not sure about that, but, um, well, um, your first topic later was about the, when they pull us over, they pull us over because they can make money off of us.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.681]  I don't believe they pull over the immigrants for the same reason.
[02:43:24.701 --> 02:43:25.862]  Well, no, I mean, the police admit.
[02:43:25.962 --> 02:43:37.006]  I've had Austin cops tell me, and there's been good sheriffs on the news that say, look, I arrest carloads of illegal aliens, they'll even have marijuana on them, and the citizen we charge, we're just told, release them, and the feds say we're not picking them up.
[02:43:37.486 --> 02:43:44.789]  And I've been to court watching where the illegal aliens in Austin get a $50 fine for no driver's license, and they even get ticketed, and citizens get the book thrown at them.
[02:43:45.150 --> 02:43:45.830]  Absolutely.
[02:43:45.890 --> 02:43:47.270]  In the same way with the marches.
[02:43:47.871 --> 02:43:50.992]  They got them all at one time, all they gotta do is process them and
[02:43:51.488 --> 02:43:53.171]  And go through them real easy right there, right?
[02:43:53.231 --> 02:43:55.033]  Yeah, the government's totally criminal and lawless.
[02:43:55.053 --> 02:43:56.315]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:56.395 --> 02:43:57.337]  Chris in Kentucky.
[02:43:57.377 --> 02:43:58.218]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:43:58.258 --> 02:43:58.579]  Welcome.
[02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:00.842]  Yes, thanks Alex.
[02:44:01.002 --> 02:44:06.811]  I was in a few weeks ago in southern Tennessee down there in the Lewis County area, which is a pretty impoverished area.
[02:44:07.469 --> 02:44:12.634]  And the newspaper they have in our county is that there's this massive drug war they're doing with the feds.
[02:44:13.014 --> 02:44:15.116]  And I'm like, my gosh, here we go.
[02:44:15.176 --> 02:44:25.845]  Everybody's poor, a bunch of people are drug addicts robbing people to get money because they make the drugs illegal, jacks up the price so people steal to get them instead of giving them treatment, which in Europe has made it go down by 40%.
[02:44:27.206 --> 02:44:31.649]  Again, they put up billboards all over Europe 20 years ago saying, don't smoke, smoking went up.
[02:44:32.089 --> 02:44:33.030]  They went in with the D.A.R.E.
[02:44:33.090 --> 02:44:35.852]  program and it showed statistically it made kids get on drugs.
[02:44:36.092 --> 02:44:39.254]  They passed out all the types of drugs, making them think about the drugs.
[02:44:39.454 --> 02:44:41.996]  They did suicide education starting 20 years ago.
[02:44:42.416 --> 02:44:49.521]  Suicide exponentially increased because now 12 year old girls were thinking about how to choke themselves because they were shown.
[02:44:49.541 --> 02:44:52.182]  Again, these are scientific studies.
[02:44:52.222 --> 02:44:54.824]  The cops that are doing the D.A.R.E.
[02:44:54.864 --> 02:44:56.305]  program think they're helping.
[02:44:57.091 --> 02:45:00.353]  They don't know diabolical government psychiatrists came up with it.
[02:45:00.973 --> 02:45:03.734]  Yeah, there's no county territorial anything anymore.
[02:45:03.794 --> 02:45:04.795]  They just let them all in.
[02:45:04.835 --> 02:45:06.675]  They're all going to have one big police state.
[02:45:06.896 --> 02:45:08.556]  And there's a couple of deputies I know down there.
[02:45:08.576 --> 02:45:09.117]  They're good guys.
[02:45:09.177 --> 02:45:13.259]  And it's time to educate them because I'm going back down in a couple of weeks and I'm taking several copies of Terror Storm.
[02:45:13.319 --> 02:45:13.939]  I'm handing them out.
[02:45:13.979 --> 02:45:15.099]  It's time to wake these people up.
[02:45:15.139 --> 02:45:17.701]  Well, the key is we need to stop thinking drugs are cool.
[02:45:17.841 --> 02:45:20.462]  Anybody you know using drugs needs to be shunned.
[02:45:21.362 --> 02:45:22.423]  Drugs are not cool.
[02:45:22.483 --> 02:45:24.283]  It's what pathetic losers do.
[02:45:24.664 --> 02:45:29.166]  They destroy your life and there's nothing gangland or stylish about it.
[02:45:29.206 --> 02:45:30.386]  People, get off drugs.
[02:45:30.406 --> 02:45:31.647]  You want to beat the New World Order?
[02:45:31.967 --> 02:45:33.867]  Don't use their Ritalin, their Prozac.
[02:45:33.908 --> 02:45:35.448]  Don't use their Mota.
[02:45:35.848 --> 02:45:38.009]  Don't use their cocaine.
[02:45:38.629 --> 02:45:39.810]  Don't use their heroin.
[02:45:39.850 --> 02:45:41.070]  Don't use their ecstasy.
[02:45:41.171 --> 02:45:43.712]  Don't use any of it.
[02:45:44.032 --> 02:45:46.713]  Do not use the enemy's drugs ever!
[02:45:47.393 --> 02:45:53.658]  And see, if you tell your children, oh, you're too young to use that, or that's too cool, or you let them watch Hollywood that makes it cool, they're going to use it.
[02:45:53.958 --> 02:45:58.141]  You explain to them it's an enemy substance put out to get them ensnared.
[02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:01.704]  You know, you may have mice in your backyard, even though they aren't in your house.
[02:46:02.084 --> 02:46:06.768]  Go set a mouse trap up and show your child, this is drugs, this is cheese, this is an analogy.
[02:46:07.028 --> 02:46:11.271]  This mouse you're going to see in here tomorrow morning is just like you when you use drugs.
[02:46:11.612 --> 02:46:15.835]  They put it out for you to come eat the cheese, and then they snap the trap on your head.
[02:46:16.710 --> 02:46:17.430]  Dress nice.
[02:46:17.510 --> 02:46:18.210]  Be focused.
[02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:19.411]  Don't talk.
[02:46:19.671 --> 02:46:21.091]  Don't hang out with the bad kids.
[02:46:21.151 --> 02:46:22.111]  Don't get in trouble.
[02:46:22.571 --> 02:46:25.472]  This is a prison grid meant to get us all into the system.
[02:46:25.732 --> 02:46:29.752]  Stay absolutely focused and straight, and they're still going to come after you.
[02:46:29.772 --> 02:46:31.353]  That's exactly right.
[02:46:32.373 --> 02:46:34.353]  And I just, like I said, I'm going to take action.
[02:46:34.373 --> 02:46:37.874]  They're good guys, but they're going to be brainwashed really bad.
[02:46:37.954 --> 02:46:39.614]  And listen, we take action with the people.
[02:46:40.034 --> 02:46:42.195]  Folks, don't stand there and do something.
[02:46:42.255 --> 02:46:42.735]  I'm doing it.
[02:46:43.175 --> 02:46:43.695]  Absolutely.
[02:46:43.715 --> 02:46:44.515]  You keep it up, Chris.
[02:46:45.789 --> 02:46:47.670]  Let's talk to Anthony in Minnesota.
[02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:48.691]  You're on the air, welcome.
[02:46:50.151 --> 02:46:50.912]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:46:51.012 --> 02:46:51.692]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:46:52.112 --> 02:46:52.692]  Thanks for calling.
[02:46:53.493 --> 02:46:54.273]  Not too bad.
[02:46:54.893 --> 02:47:02.617]  Hey, I just wanted to let people know, get these armchair internet quarterbacks out that sit around and just watch videos all day.
[02:47:03.437 --> 02:47:05.178]  You need to get out and do some action.
[02:47:05.198 --> 02:47:10.101]  I mean, when we got out of Geraldo's show out there in New York, it was a priming set.
[02:47:11.345 --> 02:47:16.151]  You only need one or two people to get out there, confront your congressmen, confront your senators.
[02:47:16.271 --> 02:47:25.903]  And we had John Conyers came to Minneapolis and he flat out told us that he didn't care what we thought or what we wanted and just to keep on these people.
[02:47:28.849 --> 02:47:30.010]  Well, we're in dark days.
[02:47:30.030 --> 02:47:31.751]  They're getting ready to start World War III.
[02:47:31.771 --> 02:47:37.434]  They are intentionally, I mean, they knew the policies would do this, killing the dollar, killing the nation.
[02:47:37.474 --> 02:47:39.776]  That's going to hurt every cop and every military man out there.
[02:47:39.796 --> 02:47:43.258]  They're trying to ban many police and veterans from owning guns.
[02:47:43.698 --> 02:47:46.260]  Again, people who think you're part of the system, you're not.
[02:47:46.600 --> 02:47:47.921]  You're there to be used up.
[02:47:48.701 --> 02:47:53.364]  And their fraudulent electronic voting machines are in over a third of the country now.
[02:47:53.744 --> 02:47:56.066]  I mean, we're in a life and death battle for this republic.
[02:47:57.173 --> 02:47:57.493]  We are.
[02:47:57.533 --> 02:48:10.623]  It's like you say, I mean, it's terminal velocity and like you said earlier, I mean, it's basically like they're on the one yard line getting ready to score and if people don't get up and rise up and do something about it, they've already won.
[02:48:11.623 --> 02:48:13.865]  Exactly, but there's always another game.
[02:48:13.985 --> 02:48:17.328]  It just means we go deeper into the tyranny, it's going to get that much worse.
[02:48:17.848 --> 02:48:20.230]  It just means that we have to go in another circle.
[02:48:20.630 --> 02:48:22.972]  We have to get deeper into Hades before folks wake up.
[02:48:23.612 --> 02:48:26.094]  And yeah, they're on the one yard line of going into a deeper circle.
[02:48:26.761 --> 02:48:29.447]  We used Dante's analogy.
[02:48:30.369 --> 02:48:32.253]  I'd say we're about circle number three.
[02:48:32.955 --> 02:48:34.558]  Get ready for circle number four.
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:37.084]  They plan to take us to number nine.
[02:48:45.174 --> 02:48:50.621]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:50.982 --> 02:48:58.632]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:48:59.304 --> 02:49:06.346]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:06.766 --> 02:49:18.190]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:22.171]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:22.471 --> 02:49:24.412]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:24.732 --> 02:49:28.573]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:52:10.716 --> 02:52:11.877]  I meant to get into every day.
[02:52:11.897 --> 02:52:15.839]  I meant to get to the prisonplanet.com live questions for the forum.
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:20.502]  I printed off like a hundred of them this morning.
[02:52:23.254 --> 02:52:24.174]  And I want to get into all these.
[02:52:24.194 --> 02:52:27.775]  Maybe I should just spend an hour tomorrow trying to answer questions from the PrisonPlanet.com forum.
[02:52:28.055 --> 02:52:28.735]  It's a great place.
[02:52:28.755 --> 02:52:30.355]  We get a lot of news, tips, and info there.

[02:52:35.596 --> 02:52:46.038]  I want to thank all the folks that are in there and the fine work they do, and the great job that our moderators are doing, not letting the stalkers completely take it over, as many other forums allow.
[02:52:50.059 --> 02:52:51.999]  My new documentary is coming out.
[02:52:52.697 --> 02:52:55.920]  You'll be able, in about a week, to start pre-orders.
[02:52:56.580 --> 02:52:59.423]  Around October 1st or so, we're going to put it up so we can pre-order it.
[02:52:59.983 --> 02:53:03.466]  And then it'll ship out in the last week of October.
[02:53:03.747 --> 02:53:05.248]  So you'll get it around November 1st.
[02:53:05.809 --> 02:53:14.917]  But that way, if your pre-order's in for endgame, it'll already be packaged, it'll already be, they're on their way here right now, thousands of them on a crate from the manufacturer.
[02:53:15.197 --> 02:53:17.599]  They'll be packaged, they'll be ready, they'll be ready to ship out to you.
[02:53:20.316 --> 02:53:21.477]  But you can't pre-order it yet.
[02:53:21.537 --> 02:53:24.478]  And PrisonPlanet.TV, it'll be available October 26th.
[02:53:25.258 --> 02:53:26.278]  October 26th.
[02:53:27.279 --> 02:53:28.699]  Before you can even get the DVD.
[02:53:29.220 --> 02:53:32.081]  It's going to be up on PrisonPlanet.TV in super high quality.
[02:53:32.381 --> 02:53:38.643]  And if you want to see how quality PrisonPlanet.TV is, go to the article, If Humans Are Viruses, Then What Is The Endgame?
[02:53:40.024 --> 02:53:44.906]  And in that, Paul has YouTube clips to the two new trailers for Endgame we put out today.
[02:53:45.286 --> 02:53:46.386]  You saw the one a few weeks ago.
[02:53:46.426 --> 02:53:46.967]  It's almost got 100,000 views.
[02:53:49.147 --> 02:53:50.469]  The new ones are out today.
[02:53:51.430 --> 02:53:59.979]  But then you can also click on a link and see members' quality that you'll be able to see Endgame in, in the three different bandwidth qualities we have.
[02:54:00.019 --> 02:54:03.303]  And I mean, it's like, the highest quality looks like DVD, folks.
[02:54:03.383 --> 02:54:04.724]  It's ridiculously good.
[02:54:06.206 --> 02:54:09.930]  So that's what PrisonPlanet.tv members are going to get.
[02:54:11.525 --> 02:54:13.826]  You can burn copies of them, folks, and give them out to people.
[02:54:15.227 --> 02:54:16.888]  So that's the whole goal here.
[02:54:16.908 --> 02:54:18.049]  I want this thing to explode.
[02:54:18.329 --> 02:54:21.531]  So please go get our article of Humans or Viruses and What is the Endgame.
[02:54:21.831 --> 02:54:29.876]  It's got all this new information and The Globalist is basically openly admitting it in the article with the two new trailers in it at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[02:54:30.817 --> 02:54:33.218]  Again, if humans are the virus, what is the endgame?
[02:54:33.278 --> 02:54:34.879]  Top story, PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:54:35.399 --> 02:54:37.361]  There's another article Paul did that's very important.
[02:54:37.941 --> 02:54:41.023]  Gun Bill rewrites law to disarm more Americans.
[02:54:42.914 --> 02:54:45.237]  And it gets into this incredible new gun law.
[02:54:45.277 --> 02:54:47.120]  People need to know about that as well.
[02:54:48.021 --> 02:54:50.845]  Let's go ahead and go to one more caller.
[02:54:50.925 --> 02:54:52.707]  Cal in San Francisco.
[02:54:52.747 --> 02:54:53.088]  Go ahead.
[02:54:53.729 --> 02:54:54.890]  Hey there, Alex.
[02:54:54.950 --> 02:54:56.991]  Tomorrow they're going to vote on the Hate Crimes Bill 2067.
[02:54:58.792 --> 02:55:01.113]  It really abridges the freedom of speech.
[02:55:01.414 --> 02:55:02.794]  They're attacking everything, aren't they?
[02:55:03.195 --> 02:55:03.495]  What's that?
[02:55:03.775 --> 02:55:04.735]  They're attacking everything.
[02:55:04.936 --> 02:55:13.781]  They're attacking everything, but tomorrow they're voting on it, and we have a couple hours left to call your senator today and demand a no vote, and if they ask how they're voting, if it's yes, ask them
[02:55:14.625 --> 02:55:17.647]  How they feel they could, you know, get rid of the Article 1 of the Constitution.
[02:55:17.667 --> 02:55:20.950]  Um, but there's two phone numbers you could call to call your senator.
[02:55:21.070 --> 02:55:26.174]  All you do is you call, you say, I'd like to speak to my representative, they ask you what state you're from, and they will put you through.
[02:55:26.194 --> 02:55:28.095]  The two numbers are 1-877-851-6437.
[02:55:28.135 --> 02:55:28.376]  That's 877-851-6437.
[02:55:38.821 --> 02:55:39.541]  Or you can call 202-225-3121.
[02:55:39.561 --> 02:55:45.084]  Alright, we're out of time.
[02:55:45.124 --> 02:55:45.784]  I appreciate it.
[02:55:45.804 --> 02:55:46.284]  Anything else?
[02:55:46.764 --> 02:55:46.964]  That's it.
[02:55:46.984 --> 02:55:47.965]  Just wanted to get the word out.
[02:55:48.125 --> 02:55:50.486]  Call today because they're only there for a couple more hours.
[02:55:50.566 --> 02:55:50.966]  I hear you.
[02:55:51.006 --> 02:55:52.326]  Thank you, Cal from Cal.
[02:55:52.907 --> 02:55:57.108]  And while you're at it, you tell them no to the Veteran and Police Disarmament Bill.
[02:55:57.769 --> 02:55:58.349]  That's what it does.
[02:55:59.148 --> 02:56:13.422]  ADD, Post Traumatic Stress, any other designation, no more Peace Officer Certificate, no more Law Enforcement Certificate, no more Instant Check, no more guns, it's in the bill, and they're moving, they're moving hard, they're moving fast against us right now.
[02:56:14.823 --> 02:56:20.349]  By the way, if you missed the first hour, a lot of key info on population reduction, it's starting over at InfoWars.com right now.
[02:56:21.869 --> 02:56:26.535]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
