[00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:09.913]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:11.395]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.135 --> 00:00:14.057]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.077 --> 00:00:17.340]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.965]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.943 --> 00:00:44.386]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen, welcome, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:44.506 --> 00:00:49.471]  It is the 28th day, the 28th day of November 2007.
[00:00:49.551 --> 00:00:56.157]  We were going to have Naomi Wolf on yesterday to talk about the 10 steps to fascism, the 10 easy steps.
[00:00:56.477 --> 00:00:56.677]  I think so.
[00:01:14.145 --> 00:01:30.039]  And then John Taylor Gatto, who is a historian and really an expert, because I've researched it in great depth myself, so when I've heard him speak on the radio and read some of his writings, we tell you it's very accurate, getting in, and he knows a lot of stuff I didn't know even, but I went and looked into,
[00:01:31.323 --> 00:01:49.147]  Concerning really the secret history of American education and how they took us from the most intelligent, most informed, most wealthy, on average, most successful people on earth, and turned us into the lowest test scores, lowest IQ, dumbest, some of the dumbest people on the planet, on average.
[00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:59.330]  That's not saying all of us individually are as Americans, but it shows how this process was carried out with great, great skill.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:11.752]  Now, we are also going to get into several pieces that I want to comment on and to break down from MSNBC.
[00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:27.013]  And the individuals over there, and the way they're implying that Bush is just an idiot and a moron, which at a certain level is not very articulate compared to a John F. Kennedy or somebody like that, or a Bill Clinton.
[00:02:28.013 --> 00:02:33.515]  But you think he's attacking Bush, and at a certain level they are, but it's partisan.
[00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:42.098]  And as much as I like some of the people that are out there doing that, like John Stewart,
[00:02:43.574 --> 00:02:45.715]  Or, of course, Countdown with Keith Uberman.
[00:02:46.215 --> 00:02:49.517]  At the end of the day, all of that's going to stop when Hillary gets into office.
[00:02:50.237 --> 00:02:54.519]  And so we need to discuss the next level of all this and where this is going.
[00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:12.348]  Also, speaking of Ron Paul, I saw quite a few articles, I read them for about an hour last night, on Ron Paul, even a Washington Post detailed story explaining why Ron Paul is so popular and why all the trends show that libertarian ideas, true paleoconservative ideas, are going to get more and more popular.
[00:03:13.016 --> 00:03:17.555]  And how the Republican Party went into Congress in 1994 claiming they were going to be the
[00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:26.181]  A party of small government and freedom, and they've become the exact opposite, just like their cohorts, their partners in crime, the Democrats.
[00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:44.649]  Now, we've all said this ourselves, but when the Washington Post and the LA Times and a bunch of other newspapers were saying basically the exact same thing, get used to it, the establishment has totally blown their credibility, major societal upheaval and political revolution is in the air.
[00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.931]  There is now a public admission, I mean, I probably
[00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:49.525]  I don't know.
[00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:52.127]  Eight, nine articles and I wasn't reading all of them last night.
[00:03:52.267 --> 00:03:57.530]  It was just every other article I looked at from big publications were basically saying the same thing.
[00:03:59.171 --> 00:04:02.973]  And that's why the establishment is really getting freaked out and upset right now.
[00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:12.358]  And that's why the establishment is moving to try to build straw men, to try to discredit us.
[00:04:12.558 --> 00:04:14.599]  That's why they're putting out more and more hit pieces.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.481]  That's why they're spinning what we say and what we do.
[00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:38.984]  And, bottom line, bottom line, we need to get ready for this, because we have the momentum, we have the common sense, we have the people on our side, and more and more every day as the population wakes up, but it's still going to be a very, very dangerous road we go down.
[00:04:39.742 --> 00:04:48.168]  But it's safer to be awake and aware and fighting back instead of just laying supine prostrate on our backs going along with this.
[00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:50.390]  Ton of news straight ahead.
[00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.994]  Again, three big guests today on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:56.955]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.455 --> 00:04:58.636]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:58.676 --> 00:04:59.957]  A new world order in the near future.
[00:05:07.922 --> 00:05:08.923]  Earth is dominating.
[00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:12.787]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[00:05:12.967 --> 00:05:16.071]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:19.074]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:27.162]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:35.129]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.092]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:39.452 --> 00:05:41.974]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[00:05:42.014 --> 00:05:43.175]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:43.935]  They're not after money.
[00:05:43.955 --> 00:05:45.036]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:46.017]  They're after power.
[00:05:46.237 --> 00:05:47.257]  That's what they have to do.

[00:06:56.979 --> 00:06:59.581]  Celebrating 18 years of dedication.
[00:07:00.777 --> 00:07:03.159]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.181]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:06.982]  Then I have to go because my quick clip.
[00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:09.545]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[00:07:09.965 --> 00:07:13.308]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[00:07:13.708 --> 00:07:16.170]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[00:07:16.671 --> 00:07:17.731]  What's that name again?
[00:07:18.112 --> 00:07:19.293]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[00:07:19.673 --> 00:07:20.854]  It's CalX.
[00:07:21.254 --> 00:07:23.096]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[00:07:23.436 --> 00:07:25.298]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[00:07:26.064 --> 00:07:34.686]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[00:07:35.106 --> 00:07:40.828]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:52.351]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Schneider's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[00:07:53.012 --> 00:07:54.113]  Hey, here's a drug store.
[00:07:54.433 --> 00:07:55.113]  I'll be right back.
[00:07:55.234 --> 00:07:56.975]  I'm getting some callux for my heels.
[00:08:00.057 --> 00:08:06.081]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:06.701 --> 00:08:09.743]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.244 --> 00:08:11.304]  Alright!
[00:08:20.638 --> 00:08:32.941]  Before I get into all the Ron Paul and police state and war news and economy news, I want to play this clip of Keith Uberman's countdown where he basically implies that Bush is a buffoon and an idiot.
[00:08:34.562 --> 00:08:38.843]  No, he's a very, very wicked, cunning individual, kind of like a rattlesnake is.
[00:08:39.363 --> 00:08:45.685]  He is a bumbling fool from so much drug abuse and alcoholism and the rest of it.
[00:08:46.926 --> 00:08:50.869]  That much is clear, but overall, it just makes it all a joke.
[00:08:51.669 --> 00:09:05.178]  And while it's fun to laugh at the things that Bush does, and I've done it myself, so I'm not even really attacking Oberman here, the fact that they continue to make it just a joke really waters down just how serious it is.
[00:09:05.218 --> 00:09:14.064]  And the second clip is a better report from Oberman, and I'm just trying to not even critique Oberman, I'm trying to illustrate the fact that we all think people like Oberman and
[00:09:15.531 --> 00:09:23.294]  Colbert and others are our little buddies, but I've seen them be very one-sided and friendly towards the Democrats.
[00:09:23.474 --> 00:09:26.055]  I mean, Naomi Wolf's supposedly going to be on with us in the next hour.
[00:09:26.496 --> 00:09:30.257]  She worked for the Clintons, and she's writing this thing about how we're going into a fascist dictatorship.
[00:09:30.597 --> 00:09:33.358]  It's true, but the Clintons are involved.
[00:09:33.478 --> 00:09:35.679]  So, we have to realize it's both parties.
[00:09:35.719 --> 00:09:39.541]  And I know you as the listeners know that, but the general public still isn't fully aware of that.
[00:09:39.821 --> 00:09:42.562]  So here is Keith Olbermann.
[00:09:43.055 --> 00:09:48.581]  Good evening, this is Tuesday, November 27, 343 days until the 2008 presidential election.
[00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:53.346]  Mispronunciations and faux pas are not the exclusive province of the dummy.
[00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:56.249]  Two-time presidential candidate, intellectual, U.N.
[00:09:56.289 --> 00:10:03.276]  Ambassador Adlai Stevenson once told the world body that under Fidel Castro, human rights in Cuba, quote, have been circumcised.
[00:10:03.916 --> 00:10:05.318]  He meant circumscribed.
[00:10:05.993 --> 00:10:08.874]  But in our fifth story on the Countdown, everybody screws up words.
[00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:11.455]  This, however, is getting ridiculous.
[00:10:11.915 --> 00:10:23.720]  During his cameo at the Israeli-Palestinian conference in Maryland today, the President had less luck with the names of the participants than Czech President Václav Havel did with Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa in 1998.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:32.144]  With no new American proposals or promises to actually help facilitate the peace process, the rhetoric of progress ringing hollow at the U.S.
[00:10:32.184 --> 00:10:33.965]  Naval Academy in Annapolis this morning.
[00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.926]  And so did the pronunciation ring hollow.
[00:10:37.247 --> 00:10:42.870]  The President, flanked by leaders from Israel and the Palestinian territories, tried to convey an air of import and gravitas.
[00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:46.291]  Even putting on glasses before he embarrassed everybody.
[00:10:48.312 --> 00:10:52.735]  The representatives of the government of the State of Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organization.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:03.783]  Represented respectively by Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas in his capacity as Chairman of the PLO Executive Committee.
[00:11:05.843 --> 00:11:07.024]  Elmo was not there.
[00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:11.865]  That would be Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and President Mahmoud Abbas he's talking about.
[00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:14.806]  Mark McGuire and Sammy Shuster.
[00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:20.083]  But why remember names when the only reason for being there was to secure a photo opportunity for posterity?
[00:11:20.123 --> 00:11:23.645]  Though incredibly, Mr. Bush even needed help to do that properly.
[00:11:25.186 --> 00:11:27.587]  Congratulations for your strong leadership.
[00:11:29.289 --> 00:11:29.849]  Appreciate it.
[00:11:43.522 --> 00:11:49.929]  Thus, with the help of a man whose name he can't pronounce and whose company he quit after a mere three hours, President Bush got his photo op.
[00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.354]  We're joined now by our own Richard Wolff, Senior White House Correspondent for Newsweek Magazine.
[00:11:54.414 --> 00:11:55.114]  Richard, good evening.
[00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:57.097]  Good to be with you, Keith.
[00:11:57.817 --> 00:12:03.003]  Well, in any event, the President could only spend 120 minutes in Annapolis, if that much,
[00:12:03.958 --> 00:12:06.682]  This afternoon he made time to grant an interview to the Associated Press.
[00:12:06.722 --> 00:12:13.470]  He said he's been, quote, very engaged up to the moment in the peace process and that he's concerned that it won't work.
[00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:17.675]  So why has he avoided going to the countries and why did he leave after three hours today?
[00:12:18.897 --> 00:12:20.417]  Well, there are a couple of ways to look at this.
[00:12:20.798 --> 00:12:29.080]  First of all, any peace process at all, after seven years of nothing under this administration, is to be welcomed.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.280]  And it is a significant step forward.
[00:12:33.401 --> 00:12:42.183]  But look, if this president can achieve this much, doing relatively little, then imagine what he could achieve actually engaging with this.
[00:12:42.823 --> 00:12:52.353]  So, as this moves forward, remember this is the beginning of this, not the end, there is scope for him to actually become much more fully engaged than he has.
[00:12:52.533 --> 00:13:01.342]  The White House says he's been making phone calls, he's been doing stuff, but we all know from his language, from his schedule, that's not the case.
[00:13:02.243 --> 00:13:04.445]  He could do a lot more and he could achieve a lot more.
[00:13:04.745 --> 00:13:17.775]  But when the AP pressed him on what he thinks is very engaged, according to his own terms today about the Mideast Peace Mission, Mr. Bush replied, I work the phones, I listen, I encourage, I have meetings, I do a lot of things.
[00:13:18.035 --> 00:13:20.077]  He ran out of specifics after meetings?
[00:13:20.457 --> 00:13:24.560]  Why didn't he just go back to that line from the debates three years ago that it's all hard work?
[00:13:27.402 --> 00:13:35.549]  Every model that has happened before with American presidents getting involved in the Middle East, whether it's Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton, has been about personal engagement.
[00:13:35.569 --> 00:13:41.333]  I have no doubt that Secretary Rice will fully immerse herself in this, but it does require leadership.
[00:13:41.873 --> 00:13:49.800]  The way the president has looked at this, the way he expressed it today, was as a bilateral negotiation between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.461]  Well, yeah, the two countries have to work things out.
[00:13:51.861 --> 00:13:55.004]  But it's been bilateral for seven years, and bilateral has meant war.
[00:13:55.444 --> 00:14:01.330]  So really, it does require, in the words of one very close American ally, it requires babysitting.
[00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.633]  There is only one babysitter that can happen here, and that's the United States of America.
[00:14:05.213 --> 00:14:06.194]  And it goes on and on.
[00:14:06.475 --> 00:14:14.122]  The bigger issue here is the establishment engages in a tactic I call putting things into a process.
[00:14:15.448 --> 00:14:36.399]  And where you have untenable events, and both sides killing each other, and the Palestinians living in absolute degradation, the Israeli population living in fear under military censors and control, this just endlessly stretches it out, and it's meant to go on and on, and it's not meant to have any real peace process, but they constantly make the public think that.
[00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:41.922]  Just like with Iraq, they keep saying, oh, well, we'll be able to tell you when we can pull out next year.
[00:14:43.431 --> 00:14:50.036]  But if you actually read the Pentagon War Plans, they intend to be there for at least 30 years and to build
[00:14:51.104 --> 00:14:53.346]  What, six giant permanent bases?
[00:14:53.406 --> 00:14:54.726]  Thirty smaller bases?
[00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:55.947]  One of them, the biggest U.S.
[00:14:56.007 --> 00:14:56.928]  Embassy in the world?
[00:14:56.948 --> 00:14:58.669]  It'll hold 3,000 people?
[00:14:58.709 --> 00:14:59.710]  A giant command base?
[00:14:59.730 --> 00:15:09.836]  And now they're saying, oh, 50,000 troops are basically going to stay there forever, because the Iraqi government has just now asked us to stay, and has just now asked us to build bases.
[00:15:10.396 --> 00:15:20.423]  They've been building bases since day one, and then now they act like the puppet government has made this decision and told us to stay, and so it doesn't matter what the American people want.
[00:15:21.235 --> 00:15:22.916]  Speaking of that, do you have that Fox News clip?
[00:15:25.538 --> 00:15:27.340]  No, there's another Fox News clip I sent you.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:33.504]  I forgot to ask if you had it, where Fox News is talking about how we're not going to end the war, how we're going to keep troops there.
[00:15:33.524 --> 00:15:35.786]  Yeah, let's go ahead and play that one.
[00:15:35.806 --> 00:15:42.691]  It's another example of how they put it into a process and then keep stretching it out to another year, another year, another year, another year.
[00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:44.613]  That's how they run these occupations.
[00:15:44.633 --> 00:15:44.973]  Here it is.
[00:15:45.692 --> 00:15:52.835]  President Bush and Iraqi leader Nouri al-Maliki have signed a deal setting a foundation for the long-term relationship between the U.S.
[00:15:52.875 --> 00:15:53.395]  and Iraq.
[00:15:53.815 --> 00:15:57.596]  The pact will be negotiated next year and is supposed to be finalized by July.
[00:15:58.016 --> 00:16:09.000]  Senior Iraqi officials say Iraq will offer America military bases outside major Iraqi cities in return for security guarantees against both foreign threats and internal attacks.
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.621]  The plan calls for a long-term U.S.
[00:16:11.681 --> 00:16:12.642]  force of about 50,000 troops
[00:16:14.102 --> 00:16:16.484]  Down from the current figure of more than 160,000.
[00:16:16.564 --> 00:16:22.347]  So there's the announcement on Fox News.
[00:16:22.367 --> 00:16:25.128]  Now we told you a year before the war that was the plan.
[00:16:25.209 --> 00:16:39.577]  Not because we are riding around in gypsy caravans and have crystal balls, but because the Pentagon and the Israeli war planners had said as early as 1983 this was the plan.
[00:16:39.637 --> 00:16:41.338]  Break Iraq in three to four parts,
[00:16:42.399 --> 00:16:50.190]  Show sectarian violence, spread rebellion and discord and destabilization into the rest of the region, all part of a balkanization strategy.
[00:16:51.736 --> 00:16:56.499]  All part of a divide-and-conquer strategy.
[00:16:56.999 --> 00:16:58.380]  And that's exactly what they've done.
[00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:15.229]  Now, compare that to this Keith Olbermann report that is very illuminating, and does point out the hypocritical nature of Fox News and others concerning 9-11, and those of us that even dare talk about prior knowledge, or letting it happen, or Bush knew, here it is.
[00:17:16.112 --> 00:17:22.757]  First person in the world to bronze, the Bathtub Head himself, John Gibson, host of Fox Noises, is the big, I'm sorry, co-host.
[00:17:22.817 --> 00:17:24.998]  Now how's that working out for him?
[00:17:25.559 --> 00:17:31.083]  After the Scott McCullin, Freudian slip, Gibby reiterates, whoever out of Valerie Flames should get a medal, and who is I?
[00:17:31.163 --> 00:17:32.744]  Carl World, I'd pin it on him myself.
[00:17:33.404 --> 00:17:34.625]  Bathtub Head's explanation?
[00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:42.391]  He knows the inside story, that she was part of a, quote, anti-Bush cabal inside the CIA, something that should be rooted out.
[00:17:43.343 --> 00:17:46.129]  John, you do realize that you're such a non-insider.
[00:17:46.509 --> 00:17:50.557]  You've just exhausted your knowledge on the subject by successfully spelling CIA.
[00:17:52.469 --> 00:18:04.453]  Our runner-up, Rudolph Giuliani, buying those rationalizations by the carload lot, trying now to take back his 1972 presidential vote for George McGovern by telling the Weekly Standard, quote, I had traditionally been a Democrat.
[00:18:04.573 --> 00:18:05.714]  It was almost like a reflex mode.
[00:18:06.194 --> 00:18:13.557]  I actually remember saying to myself, if I was a person really deciding who should be president right now, I'd probably vote for Nixon, because then the country would be safer with Nixon.
[00:18:13.977 --> 00:18:15.157]  My concern was the Soviets.
[00:18:15.537 --> 00:18:16.178]  Foreign policy.
[00:18:16.438 --> 00:18:17.238]  Strong military.
[00:18:18.406 --> 00:18:20.767]  So, you were for Nixon before you were against him?
[00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:25.470]  My, Rudy, 344 days to the election, you've already run out of BS?
[00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:37.916]  But our winner, the New York Post, mocking the Ohio University poll, showing that 62% of Americans agree that it is either very likely or somewhat likely that the government failed to heed warnings about 9-11.
[00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:46.501]  You know, like the Intel Roundup titled, Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S., or the flight school warning from Phoenix, or the tenant briefing.
[00:18:47.111 --> 00:18:50.152]  So this is what the clowns at the New York Post put up as their headline about this.
[00:18:50.872 --> 00:18:51.733]  Blame U.S.
[00:18:51.753 --> 00:18:54.114]  for 9-11 idiots in majority!
[00:18:55.174 --> 00:18:56.355]  Ah, but how big a majority?
[00:18:56.555 --> 00:18:58.275]  And who are those blame U.S.
[00:18:58.295 --> 00:18:59.236]  for 9-11 idiots?
[00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:01.677]  Same newspaper, New York Post, April 12, 2002.
[00:19:01.877 --> 00:19:03.317]  Front page.
[00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:04.277]  Bush, no!
[00:19:04.958 --> 00:19:08.219]  Prez was warned of possible hijackings before terror attacks!
[00:19:10.732 --> 00:19:22.681]  See, anybody can throw somebody under a bus, even a president under a bus, but it takes particularly elastic morality to pretend you have pulled him out from under the bus and then to start yelling at others as if they did it.
[00:19:23.262 --> 00:19:26.785]  The New York Post, your best defense against dog droppings.
[00:19:27.245 --> 00:19:34.210]  Today's worst persons in the world!
[00:19:34.331 --> 00:19:38.614]  But still, still, it's a joke.
[00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:43.332]  See, they present it as a joke.
[00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:55.998]  When Fox News talks about how they've got cameras on police cars scanning all your plates, or cameras in school bathrooms, or door-to-door gun searches, they'll say it's bad, but they'll laugh about it.
[00:19:56.899 --> 00:19:57.459]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.985 --> 00:19:59.445]  Gold.
[00:19:59.765 --> 00:20:01.046]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:20:01.286 --> 00:20:07.389]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:20:07.589 --> 00:20:11.391]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:20:11.751 --> 00:20:13.632]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:20:13.692 --> 00:20:15.993]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:20:16.133 --> 00:20:23.777]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as a common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[00:20:24.217 --> 00:20:24.638]  We're good to go.
[00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:44.612]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:20:44.932 --> 00:20:46.973]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:20:46.993 --> 00:20:53.875]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.

[00:20:59.872 --> 00:21:01.733]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:02.334 --> 00:21:11.279]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:11.719 --> 00:21:18.924]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:25.145]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:21:58.564 --> 00:22:02.006]  Attention, this is Jack Blood with an urgent GCN News Bulletin.
[00:22:02.226 --> 00:22:04.367]  Do you desperately need to get out of debt fast?
[00:22:04.487 --> 00:22:06.948]  Would you like to make some of your debts disappear completely?
[00:22:07.228 --> 00:22:11.571]  If so, and you're a GCN listener, there is a very real chance you will now be able to do it.
[00:22:11.611 --> 00:22:12.291]  Here's why.
[00:22:12.711 --> 00:22:18.634]  A new manual has just been published that reveals how you can get out of debt in 90 minutes without any loans or bankruptcy whatsoever.
[00:22:18.874 --> 00:22:24.877]  The insider secrets revealed allow you to get out of debt so fast and so completely that it makes some people feel like they're cheating.
[00:22:25.097 --> 00:22:26.038]  But they're not cheating.
[00:22:26.258 --> 00:22:30.261]  The secrets taught in the manual are 100% legal and 100% ethical.
[00:22:30.461 --> 00:22:34.784]  It's just that bankers, debt collectors, and credit card companies don't want you to know about these loopholes.
[00:22:34.884 --> 00:22:42.389]  Learn how to finally teach financial vultures some humility by beating them at their own game, and above all, learn how to bail out for a soft landing.
[00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:43.049]  Get control.
[00:22:43.269 --> 00:22:43.830]  Get relief.
[00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:44.590]  Get some sleep.
[00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.913]  Go to www.outin90.com.
[00:22:48.033 --> 00:22:51.415]  That's www.outin90.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:22:51.435 --> 00:22:51.615]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:22:58.598 --> 00:23:03.159]  We at The Bible Says want to alert the world to the topic of the Mark of the Beast.
[00:23:03.559 --> 00:23:06.500]  Soon it will be upon us as an overwhelming surprise.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.380]  The world is pressing toward a forced one-world religion.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:14.561]  The real issue behind this is the union of church and state nullifying our First Amendment.
[00:23:14.941 --> 00:23:20.302]  Americans will have to give up their peculiar beliefs and accept what the new world religious leaders prescribe.
[00:23:20.622 --> 00:23:23.583]  In 2005, President Bush signed the REAL ID Act.
[00:23:23.763 --> 00:23:24.344]  We're good to go.
[00:23:47.165 --> 00:23:52.637]  For a better understanding of this very important topic and to receive your three free books and a free DVD, call 1-888-211-1715.
[00:23:52.657 --> 00:23:53.098]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[00:24:23.647 --> 00:24:51.418]  Wake up boys, there's a light at the window I can hear someone knocking on the door
[00:24:53.254 --> 00:25:02.121]  There are voices in the street And the sound of running feet And they whisper the word... Alex!
[00:25:03.783 --> 00:25:22.978]  There are men coming down from the valley There are tall ships flying off the coast And they carry the light in the dark of the night Like a whisper in the wind
[00:25:26.624 --> 00:25:53.692]  Bring my gun and a handful of silver By the sea we will gather for the fight It's been so many years So many tears We have lost once before Now we'll settle the score When our cannons will roar Revolution!
[00:25:57.566 --> 00:25:59.488]  Let me shift gears now to another subject.
[00:26:00.028 --> 00:26:02.090]  This is from the Associated Press.
[00:26:02.311 --> 00:26:03.332]  Athens, Greece.
[00:26:03.572 --> 00:26:04.152]  Big brother.
[00:26:05.534 --> 00:26:11.760]  Head of Greek Privacy Watchdog resigns over police use of cameras to monitor protests.
[00:26:12.674 --> 00:26:19.980]  The head of Greece's Privacy Watchdog, their government watchdog group, resigned Monday over the government's use of traffic cameras.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.441]  So they first put them in for traffic, then it's for spying.
[00:26:22.822 --> 00:26:27.585]  To monitor demonstrations, raising the stakes in a heated dispute over civil liberties.
[00:26:28.546 --> 00:26:35.211]  Now, even in Communist China, the government has gotten in trouble because it's so much seen as Big Brother.
[00:26:35.792 --> 00:26:37.593]  Even in China, where they arrest you for your speech.
[00:26:38.622 --> 00:26:46.128]  That the general public, though, see, they can arrest you over there by claiming you violated the government's code, and they go after you.
[00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:50.752]  But then they also say, but if you aren't under suspicion, you shouldn't be watched.
[00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:54.995]  They have more of a Fourth Amendment over there than we have here now.
[00:26:56.136 --> 00:27:06.805]  And there were articles months ago about that in China, where they've been forced to take down cameras in parks and other areas, because lo and behold, the Chinese population protested and sued and
[00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:08.751]  We're good to go.
[00:27:30.091 --> 00:27:39.198]  His powerful data protection authority's regulations by using closed circuit cameras for surveillance at a Central Athens protest Saturday despite a ban.
[00:27:39.238 --> 00:27:40.099]  Now let's stop right there.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.924]  Under federal and state laws, the police aren't allowed to run your plates unless they have probable cause.
[00:27:46.965 --> 00:27:47.345]  They think
[00:27:48.290 --> 00:28:15.827]  That you might be driving drunk or and it's pretty easy Level, I mean, I mean, there's not much there but but but still they're supposed to have some probable cause to run your plates Under the next system We were reading this article out of Popular mechanics of all places pushing how great this is you're staying Mike here at the office of you know, there are logins that we pulled it up in there indeed is and
[00:28:17.108 --> 00:28:23.693]  And so I'm illustrating here how they have face scanning cameras, millions of cameras all over the country, small towns have federally installed cameras.
[00:28:24.653 --> 00:28:29.597]  They told the general public ten years ago, oh these are just for traffic, but yeah, dual use, they're for spying on the public.
[00:28:29.937 --> 00:28:30.938]  Now they admit they are.
[00:28:31.218 --> 00:28:33.440]  Cameras in school bathrooms, cameras in the schools.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:35.581]  I mean, no one can deny this is Big Brother.
[00:28:36.282 --> 00:28:37.963]  The cameras hooked into the police departments.
[00:28:38.823 --> 00:28:42.166]  No privacy, no due process, no nothing, guilty until proven innocent.
[00:28:42.826 --> 00:28:43.867]  And now I have an article
[00:28:44.867 --> 00:28:52.416]  Here, out of the Palm Beach Post, that is talking about how they have the cameras that shout orders at you at the beach.
[00:28:52.456 --> 00:28:57.962]  If you start kissing or holding hands, it's a quote, anti-sex cameras, but also a quote to fight crime.
[00:28:58.162 --> 00:28:59.504]  So now they shout orders at you.
[00:28:59.524 --> 00:29:02.948]  They want you to know the cameras are there, and they have this oppressive control.
[00:29:04.776 --> 00:29:06.677]  But here it is out of Poplar Mechanics.
[00:29:06.737 --> 00:29:08.658]  I've been telling you about this for about eight, nine years.
[00:29:08.678 --> 00:29:13.000]  Because I would see the federal grants and state grants for this and it was never in the news then.
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:22.184]  The last four or five years it has been in the news that Houston, Austin, San Diego, LA, New York, a bunch of cities have gotten it.
[00:29:23.425 --> 00:29:23.785]  And it is
[00:29:25.026 --> 00:29:31.590]  Police cars with cameras on both sides that can read hundreds of plates a second, and they're running everybody's plates, and they got cameras on the poles doing it.
[00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:44.057]  And so this is Big Brother, and we got Jesse Benton from the Ron Paul campaign coming up, but after we have him on, I'm gonna get back into all this, and look at how in China they see what it is, in Greece they see what it is, but in England and the U.S.
[00:29:44.117 --> 00:29:47.619]  and other places, where we've always had liberty, we don't know tyranny when we see it.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.461]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.481 --> 00:29:52.402]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.438 --> 00:29:56.114]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:59.355 --> 00:30:02.296]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[00:30:02.456 --> 00:30:07.657]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[00:30:07.977 --> 00:30:13.258]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:30:13.698 --> 00:30:14.839]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:15.179 --> 00:30:24.101]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[00:30:24.501 --> 00:30:26.083]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.541]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:31:58.886 --> 00:32:04.372]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:04.812 --> 00:32:09.036]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:09.477 --> 00:32:16.324]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:16.764 --> 00:32:23.468]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:23.788 --> 00:32:25.389]  There are no reported side effects.
[00:32:25.689 --> 00:32:28.870]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:31.612]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:32:31.912 --> 00:32:33.052]  BioSolutions has over 550
[00:32:34.093 --> 00:32:34.373]  I think so.
[00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:35.123]  Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me I sit down with Big Brother Don't like those RFID's
[00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:42.198]  I got the blues about my freedom.
[00:33:43.179 --> 00:33:47.080]  Got the blues about tyranny.
[00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:51.442]  I got the blues about my freedom.
[00:33:52.403 --> 00:33:57.885]  Got the blues about tyranny.
[00:33:58.265 --> 00:34:03.048]  I sat down with Big Brother and the National ID.
[00:34:07.256 --> 00:34:31.475]  Don't want a chip in my wallet Chip in my car And if I want to travel It's nobody's business how far Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me I said shame on big brother Always tracking and tracing me
[00:34:35.174 --> 00:34:58.566]  Don't wanna chip in my mother Chip in my wife Chip in my babies Stay out of our lives Don't want no shackles Don't want no shackles on me I sit down with big brother No more slavery
[00:35:30.982 --> 00:35:33.323]  Now do you want a chip in your forehead?
[00:35:33.343 --> 00:35:35.403]  A chip in your arm?
[00:35:36.323 --> 00:35:40.024]  Always tweaking your brain and causing you harm.
[00:35:40.284 --> 00:35:42.364]  Don't want no shackles.
[00:35:43.745 --> 00:35:45.845]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[00:35:49.586 --> 00:35:54.287]  I sat down with Big Brother in the good old USA.
[00:35:58.832 --> 00:36:02.075]  I said, down with Big Brother!
[00:36:04.237 --> 00:36:06.579]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:08.841 --> 00:36:11.203]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:16.287]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:18.029 --> 00:36:19.811]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:20.631 --> 00:36:22.813]  Don't want a spy chip in me.
[00:36:25.094 --> 00:36:25.714]  Everybody!
[00:36:25.974 --> 00:36:29.495]  I said down with Big Brother!
[00:36:31.936 --> 00:36:36.317]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:36.557 --> 00:36:40.738]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:41.138 --> 00:36:44.059]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:45.659 --> 00:36:47.440]  Down with Big Brother!
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:50.140]  It's all about liberty!
[00:36:57.375 --> 00:36:58.897]  Welcome back ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:58.957 --> 00:37:14.071]  I've got Naomi Wolf coming up next hour if the time zone bug doesn't continue to get our guest as well as Jesse Benton and John Taylor Gatto with the secret history of education all coming up in the second and third hour.
[00:37:15.172 --> 00:37:20.517]  Right now let me just go ahead and get back into this report
[00:37:24.582 --> 00:37:28.423]  Top 5 Next Generation Cop Car Gadgets.
[00:37:29.404 --> 00:37:30.104]  And it says number 3.
[00:37:30.144 --> 00:37:33.745]  This is Popular Mechanics, good old Hearst Publishing, telling us how great it is.
[00:37:33.785 --> 00:37:43.368]  Now, notice, this is in the news a decade after it started being tested, five years after it's been put in, in a whole string of states that I knew about.
[00:37:43.388 --> 00:37:51.031]  In fact, it says, what, New Jersey, it says Texas, I know it's in California,
[00:37:52.467 --> 00:37:54.488]  And I've seen it on Austin cars.
[00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:57.531]  I've seen it on... It's got actually four cameras.
[00:37:58.071 --> 00:38:02.654]  It's black pods around the sirens on each end.
[00:38:04.975 --> 00:38:10.879]  And it says here that it reads all of your license plates and runs them.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.043]  In about 20 milliseconds, the officer gets results in near real time.
[00:38:17.584 --> 00:38:19.185]  So we're going to be getting into that
[00:38:20.098 --> 00:38:25.321]  A little bit later, and then illustrate just how serious these Big Brother tools are.
[00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:45.010]  You're being searched, you're being scanned, and it's also been incorporated into the cameras that are on the light poles and everywhere, because if those are digital cameras, they're able to run them in to the quote, threat matrix centers, county emergency management centers that have FEMA and the feds within them, hooked into the Pentagon, hooked into the Department of Transportation,
[00:38:45.911 --> 00:38:51.093]  I'll never forget one morning my dad called me about five years ago and said, turn to C-SPAN, turn to C-SPAN about 7 a.m.
[00:38:51.473 --> 00:39:07.238]  and I turned it on and they had the federal head of the Department of Transportation on bragging and they were flipping around the different cameras around the country showing how the feds had put these systems in and I saw other cities my dad said that before I flipped over there they were showing Austin Roads.
[00:39:07.913 --> 00:39:13.662]  And then flipping to downtown Austin and showing people walking around and bragging about the federal control.
[00:39:13.682 --> 00:39:15.725]  But you don't have to believe me about that C-SPAN program.
[00:39:15.926 --> 00:39:18.209]  You can just go Google it and pull the news articles up.
[00:39:18.570 --> 00:39:19.651]  So this is the control.
[00:39:19.671 --> 00:39:23.017]  And this is the control that Congressman Ron Paul
[00:39:23.835 --> 00:39:28.876]  We'll attempt to reverse as president and I don't know what to say.
[00:39:28.896 --> 00:39:31.036]  It's just a meteoric rise continues.
[00:39:31.316 --> 00:39:37.998]  So we got Jesse Benton on, the Head Communications Director, Director Communications, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:39:38.398 --> 00:39:39.258]  Jesse's on the road.
[00:39:39.278 --> 00:39:40.718]  We're very thankful for your time, Jesse.
[00:39:41.598 --> 00:39:41.918]  Thanks, Al.
[00:39:41.938 --> 00:39:42.859]  It's great to be with you.
[00:39:43.739 --> 00:39:44.599]  Where are you right now?
[00:39:44.619 --> 00:39:50.380]  I am in sunny Clearwater, Florida, here for the CNN YouTube-based debate that's happening tonight.
[00:39:52.192 --> 00:39:59.399]  Tell us, in the run-up, what some of the issues the Congress is planning to focus on are.
[00:40:01.101 --> 00:40:08.708]  Well, tonight, you know, Rob's going to talk about freedom like he normally does, and I think tonight's debate is going to have an interesting little twist.
[00:40:08.828 --> 00:40:16.816]  I don't know how many of your listeners checked out the Democratic YouTube debate, but it's all going to be questions that are submitted by
[00:40:17.476 --> 00:40:30.586]  Regular people out there in America through YouTube videos, and I think it really gives Ron a great opportunity to be able to address the concerns of real Americans that have taken the time to make these videos and submit these questions.
[00:40:31.426 --> 00:40:43.395]  I mean, that's just great, and anytime that Ron can get closer to the American people, he just really shines, and people just realize he's the one that's really defending the best interests of the American people.
[00:40:44.918 --> 00:40:45.879]  Well, he certainly is.
[00:40:46.259 --> 00:40:48.500]  Jesse, we're very thankful for your hard work as well.
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.060]  How are you holding up to the schedule?
[00:40:51.101 --> 00:40:55.063]  Believe me, just being around Dr. Paul is all the motivation anybody needs.
[00:40:55.163 --> 00:40:56.983]  It's such an honor and a privilege.
[00:40:57.063 --> 00:40:58.364]  I'm nobody special.
[00:40:58.404 --> 00:41:03.406]  I'm just lucky enough to have the greatest job in the world and working for the best politician in my generation.
[00:41:03.786 --> 00:41:07.008]  Jesse, I know that you probably had to step away somewhere.
[00:41:07.028 --> 00:41:08.088]  Where are you right now?
[00:41:10.646 --> 00:41:14.167]  We are at a funder in a restaurant down in Clearwater, Florida.
[00:41:14.187 --> 00:41:15.708]  Just having a private little fundraiser.
[00:41:15.728 --> 00:41:18.309]  You know, just more people getting together.
[00:41:18.329 --> 00:41:20.510]  You know, we have people on the internet getting together to give money.
[00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:28.913]  We have people that want to step up and talk to Dr. Paul and are willing to part with their hard-earned Federal Reserve notes to have lunch with Dr. Paul.
[00:41:28.953 --> 00:41:30.174]  So, I've just stepped away.
[00:41:30.814 --> 00:41:32.194]  Jesse, we're not going to keep you too long.
[00:41:32.254 --> 00:41:36.416]  Is there a way you can step into another office because the echo is so bad you're almost unintelligible?
[00:41:37.139 --> 00:41:39.021]  He echoed it so bad I'm unintelligible.
[00:41:39.101 --> 00:41:40.002]  Is this any better?
[00:41:40.362 --> 00:41:41.163]  That is a lot better.
[00:41:41.864 --> 00:41:42.084]  Is it?
[00:41:42.144 --> 00:41:42.524]  Oh, great.
[00:41:42.705 --> 00:41:43.666]  Okay.
[00:41:43.926 --> 00:41:44.466]  I apologize.
[00:41:44.526 --> 00:41:45.287]  It was bad before.
[00:41:45.748 --> 00:41:46.649]  Yeah, problem solved.
[00:41:46.669 --> 00:41:48.270]  I don't know what you did, brother, but it did it.
[00:41:53.155 --> 00:41:54.596]  Let's talk strategy.
[00:41:54.957 --> 00:41:57.960]  Let's talk what you need the troops listening right now to do.
[00:41:59.051 --> 00:42:05.133]  Well, I think everybody realized just how important November the 5th was.
[00:42:05.593 --> 00:42:07.994]  It was amazing to see what the grassroots was able to do.
[00:42:09.014 --> 00:42:10.394]  You had a big role in that, Alex.
[00:42:10.554 --> 00:42:14.835]  It was amazing what you were able to do and all the grassroots supporters out there were able to do.
[00:42:17.436 --> 00:42:22.938]  No, you know, the publicity that we got from having this unprecedented fundraising day, November 5th, was amazing.
[00:42:23.438 --> 00:42:27.979]  The money that we were able to pull in over $4 million in one day, record-setting day, was incredible.
[00:42:28.439 --> 00:42:33.661]  And I guess it looks like people are organizing another amazing event for November 16th.
[00:42:34.401 --> 00:42:35.141]  The campaign is
[00:42:35.581 --> 00:42:41.006]  Well, that's why Trevor Lyman came up with the idea for a surge on the last day of November, this Friday, to try to go to that $12 million mark.
[00:42:41.046 --> 00:42:45.629]  That'll get massive press that a month early, Ron Paul would break his $12 million record.
[00:43:03.684 --> 00:43:04.425]  Yeah, you're right.
[00:43:04.445 --> 00:43:05.866]  We've heard about this other money surge.
[00:43:22.819 --> 00:43:23.340]  We're good to go.
[00:43:40.119 --> 00:43:41.219]  Absolutely.
[00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:43.060]  I mean, I cannot put into words how incredible this is.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.800]  Last night, Jesse, I spent about
[00:44:08.266 --> 00:44:09.226]  It's almost embarrassing.
[00:44:09.266 --> 00:44:10.227]  It was more than an hour.
[00:44:11.307 --> 00:44:15.408]  Late night reading, just typing Ron Paul into Google and clicking news.
[00:44:15.908 --> 00:44:18.889]  Thousands of new articles just in the last few days.
[00:44:20.029 --> 00:44:26.931]  I read 20 or so, and more than half of them, Washington Post, LA Times, were saying the same thing.
[00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:30.132]  They were saying both parties have blown their credibility.
[00:44:30.412 --> 00:44:33.192]  The Republicans came in in 94 as a small government.
[00:44:33.513 --> 00:44:34.393]  They did the opposite.
[00:44:35.513 --> 00:44:35.873]  Yes, we are.
[00:44:51.042 --> 00:45:18.719]  Ron Paul may not win, and we believe he will, and he has a shot, but regardless, this is only the start of a total realignment towards libertarian slash paleo-conservative values, and to me, and I had to quit reading, Jesse, I mean, it was article after article after article basically capitulating and saying, we're not kooks, we're the mainstream, there's been a major realignment, the liberals are waking up and becoming libertarian, conservatives are rediscovering their roots, can you speak to that?
[00:45:20.058 --> 00:45:23.582]  You know, Alex, I think you're hitting the nail right on the head there.
[00:45:23.622 --> 00:45:25.904]  We have such amazing traditions in America.
[00:45:26.245 --> 00:45:28.187]  Liberty is such a new concept.
[00:45:28.227 --> 00:45:29.889]  We've had 5,000 years of tyranny.
[00:45:29.909 --> 00:45:30.970]  We've had 200 years of liberty.
[00:45:35.755 --> 00:45:36.755]  That started here in America.
[00:45:36.815 --> 00:45:40.336]  Liberty is a new revolutionary idea that we started in America.
[00:45:40.576 --> 00:45:45.817]  We have such amazing traditions in America of limited government, personal freedom, personal responsibility.
[00:45:46.057 --> 00:45:54.059]  We've strayed away from that, but we haven't gone so far that we can't easily right the ship if we follow the Constitution, follow men like Ron Paul.
[00:45:54.559 --> 00:45:57.160]  And I think Americans are really just waking up to that.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:02.061]  We can restore our American traditions, restore our revolution of freedom,
[00:46:02.681 --> 00:46:04.042]  And we can do it.
[00:46:04.102 --> 00:46:04.623]  It's not hard.
[00:46:04.663 --> 00:46:11.348]  We can look to our answers in the Constitution, in our great American traditions, and we can get this country back on track.
[00:46:12.849 --> 00:46:18.674]  Now, Jesse, Lyman and others have come up with the idea for this blimp, but that costs $300,000.
[00:46:19.134 --> 00:46:20.616]  I think it'll be a great publicity stunt.
[00:46:20.656 --> 00:46:21.336]  I'm all for it.
[00:46:22.197 --> 00:46:24.158]  I am personally maxed out on giving.
[00:46:24.639 --> 00:46:30.243]  My wife is close to maxed out on giving, but she's going to give again Friday for this November 30th surge.
[00:46:31.464 --> 00:46:44.816]  But what do you think of the idea, because I've looked into it before, it's between $300 and $500, $1,000 if you want to have the plane stop and refuel, to have Cessnas over bowl games this weekend, the next weekend, and the weekend after that.
[00:46:45.396 --> 00:46:49.820]  People, every major city, just Google it, you know, aerial advertising.
[00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:55.565]  Today I'm going to call, just like I said I was going to get that poll, I did that with Zogby, a fair poll.
[00:46:56.705 --> 00:47:00.427]  I'm going to buy airplanes on it because it's so inexpensive comparatively.
[00:47:00.827 --> 00:47:09.292]  I'm going to buy airplanes on at least three dates coming up in the next two weeks, the next three weeks, and then one coming up in the primaries.
[00:47:09.612 --> 00:47:14.454]  And I want everybody else to buy airplanes that say RonPaul2008.com.
[00:47:14.694 --> 00:47:19.777]  I'll even buy the jumbo longer banners and have them fly over bowl games and over big concerts.
[00:47:19.817 --> 00:47:20.437]  What do you think of that?
[00:47:21.117 --> 00:47:22.959]  I think it sounds like a wonderful idea, Alex.
[00:47:23.039 --> 00:47:27.863]  And you know what's been so amazing about this campaign is the grassroots support like this.
[00:47:28.144 --> 00:47:35.170]  You know, the campaign is about freedom and the message about freedom and the way this campaign has run has been about freedom.
[00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:39.254]  It's been so much bigger than our little campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia.
[00:47:39.514 --> 00:47:40.315]  It's so much huger.
[00:47:40.355 --> 00:47:41.496]  It's about the grassroots.
[00:47:41.556 --> 00:47:45.139]  It's about people like you that are coming up with these amazing, spontaneous,
[00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:46.420]  Creative ideas.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:56.326]  Freedom unleashes the creativity and the power of the human and the American spirit, and that's what's driving these wonderful ideas.
[00:47:56.867 --> 00:48:09.676]  So many people are coming up with these terrific, creative ideas on their own, independent of the campaign, cooperating with the campaign, supporting the campaign, supporting Dr. Paul, and supporting freedom, and that is our ace in the hole.
[00:48:09.736 --> 00:48:11.597]  That is what the other campaigns can't buy.
[00:48:13.787 --> 00:48:14.568]  Absolutely.
[00:48:14.648 --> 00:48:16.630]  Now, Jesse, give me your political instincts.
[00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:23.195]  I mean, you've shown to be very cunning when it comes to getting the message of liberty and freedom out there.
[00:48:24.557 --> 00:48:36.427]  I told Trevor, when we kind of conceived of this new offensive, and we kind of brainstormed here on air, that I thought it should be the 15th and 16th to try to raise $5 million each day, and I predict
[00:48:36.987 --> 00:48:37.468]  What do you think?
[00:48:37.488 --> 00:48:38.208]  Two day or one day money bomb?
[00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:11.470]  You know, one thing that I have noticed is with this thermometer or this live contribution counter, it really does build momentum over time.
[00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:17.175]  When we first really started to gain traction, it was at the end of last quarter, we were trying to raise $500,000 in one week.
[00:49:19.396 --> 00:49:20.877]  And, gosh, think how far we've come.
[00:49:20.897 --> 00:49:24.800]  We're talking about $10 million over the course of a couple days, and that's for a realistic goal.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:28.722]  But, you know, we saw it start to take off, and it fed on itself.
[00:49:28.782 --> 00:49:30.763]  The momentum created other momentum.
[00:49:30.803 --> 00:49:32.505]  People get excited to see the meter go up.
[00:49:32.525 --> 00:49:34.346]  They get excited to see their contribution.
[00:49:34.386 --> 00:49:34.886]  Exactly!
[00:49:35.046 --> 00:49:35.887]  One day's too short.
[00:49:35.907 --> 00:49:36.547]  We need two days.
[00:49:38.028 --> 00:49:45.453]  You know, it's going to be up to the grassroots out there, but for my two cents, two days sounds like a smart idea.
[00:49:46.562 --> 00:49:52.847]  Well, that's what Trevor wants to do, but he's kind of going with the blogs and forums, but I think that once they hear what you have to say, they might listen to it.
[00:49:52.947 --> 00:49:59.573]  Regardless, we want to get the hype going Saturday, get the media paying attention, instead of them just paying attention at the end of the second day.
[00:49:59.893 --> 00:50:06.899]  And I would think that $4.2 million, wouldn't you say we got a quadrupling for the campaign in just massive media coverage?
[00:50:07.619 --> 00:50:08.780]  Oh, we sure did, gosh.
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:13.463]  You know, we were covered on virtually every single mainstream media outlet.
[00:50:13.803 --> 00:50:14.884]  It was just incredible.
[00:50:15.564 --> 00:50:22.789]  I am at a loss to estimate the value of that, but, you know, it was just incredible, the coverage, the Fable coverage.
[00:50:22.809 --> 00:50:31.134]  People were blown away, and, you know, as you know, our biggest obstacle we still have to overcome is nationwide
[00:50:31.938 --> 00:50:32.339]  It is a big idea.
[00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:03.310]  A New World Order!
[00:51:04.011 --> 00:51:08.232]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[00:51:08.912 --> 00:51:10.653]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[00:51:10.993 --> 00:51:13.994]  Isn't their objective to be world domination?
[00:51:14.534 --> 00:51:16.975]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:51:17.696 --> 00:51:25.058]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:51:28.047 --> 00:51:33.031]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:51:33.491 --> 00:51:36.993]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:51:37.354 --> 00:51:39.895]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:51:39.935 --> 00:51:40.896]  Most people have no idea.
[00:51:40.916 --> 00:51:41.817]  They're not after money.
[00:51:41.837 --> 00:51:42.937]  They have all the money they need.
[00:51:43.158 --> 00:51:43.918]  They're after power.
[00:51:44.158 --> 00:51:45.179]  That's what they're after.

[00:51:56.809 --> 00:51:57.979]  You have been warned.
[00:51:58.835 --> 00:51:59.615]  Terrorism!
[00:51:59.755 --> 00:52:00.516]  Terrorism!
[00:52:00.596 --> 00:52:06.678]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:52:06.918 --> 00:52:08.519]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:52:08.759 --> 00:52:11.240]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:26.205]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:52:58.448 --> 00:53:08.120]  In a world of government oppression and tyranny, the struggle between freedom and fascism comes a story about two people who are faced with the challenge to stand up and do the right thing for liberty.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.167]  The whole country's on a bus, a crazy driver, but the passengers can't get hold of the wheel.
[00:53:13.507 --> 00:53:14.889]  We're all gonna go over the cliff.

[00:54:12.347 --> 00:54:16.911]  Jesse Benton, Communications Director, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:54:17.011 --> 00:54:18.513]  I tell ya, he is a blessed man.
[00:54:18.573 --> 00:54:22.937]  Imagine being able to be the Communications Director in one of the most legendary campaigns ever.
[00:54:23.057 --> 00:54:31.024]  I mean, any way you cut it, they're making campaign history, and we're doing it together, changing the rules of how this is done, showing the New World Order.
[00:54:31.384 --> 00:54:32.365]  We're not going along with them.
[00:54:32.625 --> 00:54:35.568]  Jesse, in the few minutes we've got left with you here as you're out there in the field,
[00:54:36.008 --> 00:54:40.594]  We were talking during the break, and I guess the info I had was correct.
[00:54:40.654 --> 00:54:51.768]  You need money now to be able to budget it out for the rest of this month, but if you get $5-10 million on the 15th and 16th, you're going to be able to spend that coming up in January and February in the primaries.
[00:54:52.443 --> 00:54:53.484]  Yeah, oh, absolutely.
[00:54:53.524 --> 00:55:01.068]  I mean, every dollar we get is a blessing, and if we have another record-setting day on the 15th and 16th, that is nothing but good stuff.
[00:55:01.388 --> 00:55:04.890]  However, you know, we do need money in the meantime, because we're setting our budgets now.
[00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:06.631]  How much can we spend in the state?
[00:55:06.671 --> 00:55:07.611]  I'm in Florida right now.
[00:55:07.891 --> 00:55:08.792]  How much can we spend here?
[00:55:08.812 --> 00:55:10.012]  We want to hire some new staff.
[00:55:10.293 --> 00:55:14.475]  We want to think about how much paid media we can do down here, and we're making those budgets now.
[00:55:14.575 --> 00:55:17.096]  So, you know, the 15th and the 16th is phenomenal.
[00:55:18.317 --> 00:55:20.218]  We also need money now as well.
[00:55:21.132 --> 00:55:27.616]  Now, for folks that don't know, this week in a lot of these first primary states is the deadline to switch Republican.
[00:55:27.896 --> 00:55:33.259]  If you were a Libertarian or a Democrat, people need to switch over now and then give us some of the basic states.
[00:55:34.019 --> 00:55:40.963]  Yeah, well, you need to know the rules of your local state, and we've got all those guidelines on our website, RonPaul2008.com.
[00:55:44.185 --> 00:55:52.369]  We've got the rules for your specific state as far as voting requirements, registration dates, all that, open, closed primaries, caucuses, things like that.
[00:55:52.609 --> 00:56:03.534]  We've also, Alex, got guidelines on how to become a delegate, and that is one of the most important things that you could do to support the Ron Paul campaign out there, is to become a Ron Paul delegate.
[00:56:03.874 --> 00:56:07.955]  That is what really is going to drive this thing.
[00:56:08.216 --> 00:56:10.797]  We need as many Ron Paul delegates as possible.
[00:56:12.407 --> 00:56:17.488]  Absolutely, and again, what are the most important battleground states, and give us some of those dates, Jesse.
[00:56:18.469 --> 00:56:21.469]  Let's see, right now we've got the Iowa Caucus, January 3rd.
[00:56:21.509 --> 00:56:24.830]  We've got New Hampshire, primary, January 8th.
[00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:32.172]  Then on the 19th, we've got the Nevada primary, and then I believe on the 24th will be South Carolina.
[00:56:33.703 --> 00:56:34.664]  All very critical.
[00:56:35.484 --> 00:56:37.825]  We think we're playing extremely well on all those.
[00:56:38.125 --> 00:56:42.868]  If I botched any of those dates, I'm sure I'm going to hear about it.
[00:56:42.928 --> 00:56:45.469]  Those are the four early ones that are coming up.
[00:56:46.014 --> 00:56:46.814]  Hard on us now.
[00:56:47.094 --> 00:56:49.515]  We're four weeks out here.
[00:56:49.575 --> 00:56:53.416]  We're four weeks out from when we're going to start voting.
[00:56:54.016 --> 00:56:55.177]  This thing is coming up on us.
[00:56:55.497 --> 00:56:57.157]  We've got to start getting ready.
[00:56:57.357 --> 00:57:01.059]  Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina, we're playing hard in those.
[00:57:01.099 --> 00:57:03.319]  We're spending millions and millions.
[00:57:03.799 --> 00:57:05.940]  And here's a football analogy.
[00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:08.721]  You guys are on the one yard line.
[00:57:08.821 --> 00:57:10.121]  I mean, you are right up there.
[00:57:10.141 --> 00:57:12.702]  You've got three feet to go, but you're on fourth down.
[00:57:13.002 --> 00:57:15.423]  We need to give the full effort now to get the touchdown.
[00:57:16.224 --> 00:57:17.085]  You're absolutely right.
[00:57:17.145 --> 00:57:22.988]  I mean, if we had six or eight more months, I have no question in my mind that we would win this campaign.
[00:57:23.448 --> 00:57:26.789]  And we could also be a little bit more leisurely in our approach.
[00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:28.290]  But right now, you're absolutely right.
[00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:29.931]  It's the fourth quarter.
[00:57:29.991 --> 00:57:30.912]  The clock is ticking.
[00:57:31.132 --> 00:57:32.132]  We're out of timeouts.
[00:57:32.192 --> 00:57:39.496]  We have to put everybody out there that cares about freedom, has to put their full effort into this thing right now, because we're going to run out of time if we don't.
[00:57:39.696 --> 00:57:42.458]  Yeah, folks, don't wish later that you wouldn't have been part of history.
[00:57:42.498 --> 00:57:48.303]  I don't normally get up here and electioneer, but it's my free speech right, and I'm doing it because RonPaul2008.com needs your help.
[00:57:48.603 --> 00:57:50.424]  A lot of our listeners aren't on the computer.
[00:57:50.444 --> 00:57:54.467]  Give them the toll-free number, Jesse.
[00:57:54.487 --> 00:57:55.648]  1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:59.271]  Got a staff standing by ready to help you out if you're not on the internet.
[00:57:59.291 --> 00:57:59.971]  1-800-RON-PAUL.
[00:58:00.412 --> 00:58:02.133]  Ron Paul's schedule for those that aren't on the internet.
[00:58:02.153 --> 00:58:03.274]  Where's he going to be in the next few days?
[00:58:04.035 --> 00:58:04.495]  Let's see.
[00:58:04.515 --> 00:58:08.218]  We're in Florida right now, then we'll be heading to New Hampshire over the weekend.
[00:58:09.292 --> 00:58:12.013]  And we need people to be in Iowa and New Hampshire right now.
[00:58:12.033 --> 00:58:13.954]  If you live in those states, you are blessed.
[00:58:14.254 --> 00:58:15.734]  We need you to knock on doors.
[00:58:15.754 --> 00:58:18.536]  Do they need to call the campaign to get tips on how to canvas?
[00:58:20.936 --> 00:58:24.278]  We're completely happy to help you out with any canvassing tips you want.
[00:58:24.318 --> 00:58:25.778]  Call the campaign, email us.
[00:58:26.078 --> 00:58:27.939]  We've also got plenty of guidelines online.
[00:58:28.259 --> 00:58:29.860]  And get in touch with your local meetup group.
[00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:36.562]  If you're not signed up at a meetup group, join one and get together with other people that care about canvas.
[00:58:36.822 --> 00:58:37.943]  Thank you so much, Jesse.
[00:58:39.969 --> 00:58:41.310]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:44.933]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:55.490 --> 00:58:56.130]  Big Brother.
[00:58:56.791 --> 00:58:57.892]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:58.572 --> 00:58:59.693]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.333 --> 00:59:01.154]  You want answers?
[00:59:01.894 --> 00:59:02.815]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:03.475 --> 00:59:07.117]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:07.658 --> 00:59:11.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:12.581 --> 00:59:16.543]  Yeah, this is history of the Rockwall 2008 campaign.
[00:59:17.364 --> 00:59:18.845]  I never got to this yesterday.
[00:59:19.739 --> 00:59:26.161]  But I'm going to cover this now, then I'm going to get into all the Big Brother developments that we haven't covered in detail in a while.
[00:59:26.201 --> 00:59:27.722]  Very important, some new developments there.
[00:59:29.023 --> 00:59:32.924]  Naomi Wolf is joining us today on this Wednesday edition, the 28th day of November 2007.
[00:59:36.545 --> 00:59:45.789]  But it was very suspicious last week when Ron Paul, last Tuesday, was in Las Vegas.
[00:59:46.838 --> 00:59:47.538]  I don't think so.
[01:00:10.874 --> 01:00:16.675]  Turns out MSNBC went and contacted him and got him to come as part of a stunt, and the media spun it.
[01:00:17.255 --> 01:00:21.216]  Again, some people here in the background, oh, the pimps are for him.
[01:00:24.177 --> 01:00:29.658]  And there's a big story up on Infowars.net that Steve Watson did covering that.
[01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:32.478]  But there's other examples of this.
[01:00:34.339 --> 01:00:39.920]  It happened last Wednesday into Thanksgiving, and it was on CBS News, AP, it was everywhere.
[01:00:42.483 --> 01:00:43.964]  And they do this over and over again.
[01:00:43.984 --> 01:00:45.485]  And this is an example of dirty tricks.
[01:00:45.785 --> 01:00:47.066]  First, they read the Liberty Dollar.
[01:00:47.126 --> 01:00:52.991]  No doubt they did that to demonize Ron Paul now and associate him with quote, counterfeiting and illegal money, when it wasn't counterfeiting or illegal.
[01:00:53.031 --> 01:00:55.713]  And even the search warrant, you know, is now bearing that out.
[01:00:57.074 --> 01:01:01.337]  And even NPR and CNN have made fun of the fads.
[01:01:02.237 --> 01:01:03.698]  So they're losing that PR battle.
[01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:06.220]  But we have a shopping cart here.
[01:01:06.821 --> 01:01:09.923]  And every day, there's two or three, sometimes more, fraudulent orders.
[01:01:10.689 --> 01:01:15.110]  And they'll come in and order something, but you can always tell because it'll be the same address over and over again.
[01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:18.651]  We just learn to spot them, and then we just refund them back.
[01:01:18.891 --> 01:01:23.312]  Well, usually they haven't even run through, so we just delete them, because we have to process them and run them through.
[01:01:24.232 --> 01:01:27.413]  And I've talked to people who run other shopping carts.
[01:01:27.473 --> 01:01:34.815]  I mean, you could be selling seeds, you could be selling baby strollers, you could be selling coffee, every major shopping cart out there of any size.
[01:01:35.422 --> 01:01:37.023]  Anybody who's got one's had this happen.
[01:01:37.383 --> 01:01:38.823]  Has people test credit cards?
[01:01:39.523 --> 01:01:45.065]  Amazon reportedly has tens of thousands of credit cards tested a day on them, because they're the biggest out there.
[01:01:45.705 --> 01:01:58.850]  Well, Ron Paul had $3,000 of fraudulent charges, gifts, last week, and then they noticed it, and so they contacted the bank credit card it was, and said, here's your money back.
[01:01:59.210 --> 01:02:02.371]  Because with their political contribution, it does process it, because they use the PayPal.
[01:02:04.342 --> 01:02:15.389]  And the media then had headlines like, Ron Paul involved in bank fraud, and then it would say later, oh it was a shopping cart and there were a couple of fraudulent orders testing cards.
[01:02:16.983 --> 01:02:18.945]  But then I heard it on talk radio.
[01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:20.126]  Look at these Ron Paul people.
[01:02:20.687 --> 01:02:21.227]  Look at them.
[01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:22.088]  They're involved.
[01:02:22.128 --> 01:02:24.090]  A white supremacist gave $500.
[01:02:25.551 --> 01:02:27.593]  That nut Alex Jones gives them money.
[01:02:28.654 --> 01:02:29.495]  And look at that.
[01:02:29.535 --> 01:02:32.718]  He's involved with criminal gold and silver coins.
[01:02:33.459 --> 01:02:34.239]  Oh, look at him.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.981]  Bank heists now.
[01:02:36.802 --> 01:02:37.983]  Fraudulent donations.
[01:02:38.003 --> 01:02:39.925]  These Ron Paul people are criminals.
[01:02:42.282 --> 01:02:43.362]  See how they do that?
[01:02:43.462 --> 01:02:44.463]  See how they play?
[01:02:45.243 --> 01:02:46.323]  They bring people.
[01:02:46.483 --> 01:02:47.203]  MSNBC.
[01:02:47.223 --> 01:02:48.944]  Tucker Carlson brings the brothel head.
[01:02:49.044 --> 01:02:49.964]  Contacted him.
[01:02:50.584 --> 01:02:53.145]  AP, it turns out, was told that, but still ran with the fraud.
[01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:55.825]  This is what they do.
[01:02:57.246 --> 01:03:02.527]  Or, Ron Paul's campaign just contacts the bank, because they'd already processed the contributions.
[01:03:02.547 --> 01:03:03.727]  It says, here's $3,000 back.
[01:03:04.608 --> 01:03:05.588]  We think these are fraudulent.
[01:03:05.608 --> 01:03:06.568]  The bank said, oh yes they are.
[01:03:06.628 --> 01:03:07.048]  Thank you.
[01:03:07.308 --> 01:03:07.948]  Quite routine.
[01:03:07.988 --> 01:03:09.829]  The bank said, oh yeah, they're just testing cards.
[01:03:10.726 --> 01:03:11.566]  We have this problem.
[01:03:12.027 --> 01:03:12.867]  It's a big problem.
[01:03:13.868 --> 01:03:15.188]  And, uh, that's the end of it.
[01:03:16.329 --> 01:03:20.251]  But by the time the media got it, people just heard, Ron Paul, bank fraud?
[01:03:20.691 --> 01:03:22.272]  Ron Paul, coins?
[01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.013]  Ron Paul, prostitutes?
[01:03:24.373 --> 01:03:25.774]  Ron Paul, white supremacist?
[01:03:26.994 --> 01:03:30.196]  Again, another example of the type of dirty tricks they play.
[01:03:30.416 --> 01:03:35.379]  So just be ready for more, and try to educate people around you about that if they bring it up to you.
[01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:37.940]  You can give them the mainstream articles.
[01:03:38.979 --> 01:03:43.522]  Because the mainstream had to admit a few days ago that, okay, the media brought the pimp.
[01:03:44.083 --> 01:03:45.984]  We'll be right back to get into Big Brother and a lot more.
[01:03:46.004 --> 01:03:50.707]  Stay with me.
[01:03:51.648 --> 01:03:53.069]  It is a big idea.
[01:03:54.110 --> 01:03:55.170]  A new world order.
[01:03:55.891 --> 01:04:00.154]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:04:00.794 --> 01:04:02.576]  It's known as the Bilderbergs.
[01:04:03.616 --> 01:04:05.778]  Put their objective being world domination.
[01:04:06.385 --> 01:04:08.809]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:04:09.570 --> 01:04:16.902]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:04:19.895 --> 01:04:24.896]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:04:25.356 --> 01:04:28.857]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:04:29.217 --> 01:04:31.738]  Bill Burgess makes great progress toward a world government.
[01:04:31.778 --> 01:04:32.938]  Most people have no idea.
[01:04:32.958 --> 01:04:33.678]  They're not after money.
[01:04:33.698 --> 01:04:34.819]  They have all the money they need.
[01:04:35.019 --> 01:04:35.799]  They're after policy.
[01:04:35.999 --> 01:04:36.999]  That's what they're after, isn't it?

[01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:52.731]  America is the fattest nation on the planet.
[01:05:52.831 --> 01:05:59.333]  The obesity epidemic kills over 300,000 Americans each and every year, and this number continues to rise at an alarming rate.
[01:05:59.493 --> 01:06:02.593]  With fast food chains everywhere, eating right is not an easy task.
[01:06:02.813 --> 01:06:05.954]  It's time to stop eating those unhealthy meals and fattening snacks.
[01:06:06.214 --> 01:06:08.875]  Assured that you and your family do not become a statistic.

[01:06:50.857 --> 01:06:53.500]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:54.061 --> 01:06:56.843]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:15.682 --> 01:07:25.811]  The Associated Press is reporting that a high-level government minister in Greece has stepped down.
[01:07:25.851 --> 01:07:42.425]  In fact, if you go to PrisonPlanet.com in the Police States section at the top, it's the fifth story down, and they're stepping down because the police in Greece are illegally using the traffic cameras to spy on the general public and watch demonstrations and protests and track the population.
[01:07:43.977 --> 01:08:01.252]  In China, several months ago, major cities had to remove cameras in public places because, again, China says, you're not allowed to criticize the Communist Party, you're not allowed to do that, and we'll arrest you and make you spend years in a gulag, in a forced labor camp, either in a factory.
[01:08:01.653 --> 01:08:05.856]  They have millions in their factories and millions on their rice farms and other plantations.
[01:08:06.177 --> 01:08:08.879]  We have photos of that and news articles on that in Endgame.
[01:08:10.072 --> 01:08:12.616]  But they at least kind of play fair.
[01:08:12.656 --> 01:08:13.478]  It's a horrible system.
[01:08:13.498 --> 01:08:14.139]  I'm not defending it.
[01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:24.675]  But the public looked at the code and said, but you're not allowed to surveil us without having probable cause, without having a reason to investigate us.
[01:08:25.387 --> 01:08:33.352]  And so, all over China, they have been removing cameras in parks and public places because the public says, we don't like being surveilled.
[01:08:33.432 --> 01:08:41.317]  So, there's big demonstrations, government ministers resigning over spying with the traffic cameras in Greece.
[01:08:42.238 --> 01:08:47.221]  Also in Russia, I've seen reports of all places, a horrible police state.
[01:08:47.521 --> 01:08:49.262]  I mean, that's how big a deal it is.
[01:08:49.322 --> 01:08:50.543]  People know that's Big Brother.
[01:08:51.468 --> 01:09:02.474]  Now, compare that to the US, where for at least a decade, we've seen news reports of not just cameras in the school classrooms, but cameras not just in the bathrooms, but in the bathroom stalls.
[01:09:02.954 --> 01:09:08.037]  Just type into Google, uh, cameras in school bathrooms, and you'll get hundreds of reports.
[01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:21.870]  And then, remember the case that was in Tennessee about four years ago, that was the worst I'd ever seen, where the visiting basketball, girls basketball team in eighth grade, went into the showers at the field house after the game.
[01:09:23.271 --> 01:09:27.913]  And there was cameras in the showers, and the girls did what was normal.
[01:09:27.953 --> 01:09:33.937]  They threw their clothes on, ran out screaming, there was parents throwing fits, police had to be called.
[01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:38.239]  And I'll never forget, this was all over the Tennessee papers,
[01:09:39.048 --> 01:09:42.130]  The principal saying, what's the big deal?
[01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.132]  There could be illegal stuff going on in the showers.
[01:09:45.172 --> 01:09:47.033]  We have to have video cameras hooked into there.
[01:09:47.333 --> 01:09:57.179]  And then it turned out they were hooked into the police department, then it turned out that they did a police investigation of themselves, and that they had had file swapping as far away as North Carolina.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:58.920]  Go look it up.
[01:10:01.001 --> 01:10:03.463]  And then now you see the reports from Sacramento,
[01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:25.471]  California to New York, New York, where they have, it's all over the country, I see these every couple days now, where the cameras in the classrooms, in the bathrooms, in the halls, in the lunchrooms are wired live into the police department and they're getting federal and state and sometimes private corporate grants to do this.
[01:10:27.213 --> 01:10:35.262]  And then you add to that that Google announced last year, people couldn't believe it, and they went to our story on Prison Planet and found the links to Google's press release.
[01:10:35.342 --> 01:10:42.570]  Google bragged and their stock went up and said, yeah, we've developed two different software packages, the one we're implementing out of Tel Aviv.
[01:10:43.587 --> 01:11:06.013]  Israel, developed by a research project we funded there, where the microphone in the, which is in almost all new computers, many of the older computers, will listen for key words, listen to a dog barking, and you'll have dog food ads flash up on your screen, it'll listen to what you're watching on television, and then tailor packaging around that, and it was just no big deal!
[01:11:06.033 --> 01:11:11.734]  I remember telling you more than ten years ago, because an engineer at Time Warner here locally told me,
[01:11:13.422 --> 01:11:15.203]  He said, Alex, you say you've got cable.
[01:11:15.964 --> 01:11:21.928]  Have you noticed the new Scientific Atlantic cable boxes have a microphone on them, but there's no application to use them at this time?
[01:11:21.948 --> 01:11:22.468]  And I said, yeah.
[01:11:22.488 --> 01:11:24.090]  And he said, well, that's two-way.
[01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:28.353]  And then three Super Bowls ago, Chicago Tribune.
[01:11:28.393 --> 01:11:29.814]  I'm just giving you some background first.
[01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.856]  Three Super Bowls ago, or was it four?
[01:11:34.517 --> 01:11:35.918]  It'll be four, I guess, in a couple months.
[01:11:36.860 --> 01:11:37.860]  How time flies.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:46.382]  Remember when Janet Jackson had the on-purpose, by design, I guess you'd call it false flag wardrobe malfunction?
[01:11:46.782 --> 01:11:48.843]  You can clearly see her just pull it out.
[01:11:49.843 --> 01:11:52.383]  And she even had it, you know, festooned with decorations.
[01:11:53.524 --> 01:11:56.304]  With, I guess it was Timberlake or somebody she was dancing around with.
[01:11:56.364 --> 01:12:04.826]  And T-Vobe, the DVR system, one of the many DVR systems, the most popular, that lets you pause, rewind, you know, fast forward, save your favorite programs.
[01:12:05.996 --> 01:12:16.162]  Tebow announced, hey, 2.3 million record replays that day of that.
[01:12:16.282 --> 01:12:18.583]  And the Chicago Tribune rightly went, well, wait a minute.
[01:12:19.123 --> 01:12:25.747]  How do you know how many people rewound and replayed her breasts coming out?
[01:12:27.628 --> 01:12:29.769]  And they went, oh, yeah, well, don't worry.
[01:12:29.789 --> 01:12:33.191]  We just have computers that analyze the data you're viewing habits.
[01:12:34.938 --> 01:12:45.903]  You see, Nielsen asks you and pays you hundreds of dollars a year, Nielsen ratings, to stick a box on your television to then monitor what you watch and then they sell that data.
[01:12:48.104 --> 01:12:55.068]  But Time Warner and of course TiVo and a hundred plus other companies don't.
[01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:56.589]  And it's the same thing.
[01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:59.390]  If somebody came to your house and knocked on your door
[01:13:00.916 --> 01:13:09.938]  And said, I'd like to pay you $100 to put cameras and microphones up in your house and watch and listen to you, everything you do, just to, for marketing data.
[01:13:11.038 --> 01:13:12.859]  But don't worry, people won't be watching you.
[01:13:12.899 --> 01:13:16.880]  Computers will be recording it and collating the data for your basic psychological algorithm.
[01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:20.920]  You would say, get off my front porch.
[01:13:21.321 --> 01:13:21.621]  They'd say, $1,000.
[01:13:21.661 --> 01:13:22.001]  You'd say, no.
[01:13:25.149 --> 01:13:30.054]  $2,000.
[01:13:25.389 --> 01:13:30.054]  Maybe some people are such warriors or exhibitionists, they would like it.
[01:13:30.334 --> 01:13:34.938]  The point is most of us would say, no, no, no, a million dollars isn't enough.
[01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:36.500]  But see, TiVo
[01:13:37.387 --> 01:13:40.728]  Google, all the rest of them, they don't ask.
[01:13:40.808 --> 01:13:41.528]  They just do it.
[01:13:41.648 --> 01:13:43.228]  And then I write articles about it.
[01:13:43.588 --> 01:13:45.268]  Steve Watson writes articles about it.
[01:13:45.549 --> 01:13:47.109]  Kurt Nemo writes articles about it.
[01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:49.129]  Paul Watson writes articles about it.
[01:13:49.789 --> 01:13:54.110]  And we're called crazy kooks because we can read the newspaper.
[01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:59.291]  The Palm Beach Post, in fact I thought I had it here on the stack.
[01:13:59.311 --> 01:13:59.911]  I looked during the break.
[01:13:59.971 --> 01:14:00.351]  I don't.
[01:14:00.371 --> 01:14:04.152]  Let me just launch another browser and pull that up.
[01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.541]  I want to illustrate to people that we're not making this stuff up.
[01:14:07.981 --> 01:14:17.864]  The Palm Beach Post reported that they're putting in cameras that watch with AI, artificial intelligence software, and it is artificially intelligent.
[01:14:18.424 --> 01:14:21.125]  It acts and makes decisions on its own.
[01:14:21.725 --> 01:14:29.288]  Kissing, holding hands, hugging, that is a prelude to sex on the beach, and they know how to sell to the public dirty sex is going on.
[01:14:29.308 --> 01:14:30.408]  We've got to stop it.
[01:14:31.428 --> 01:14:32.229]  We're good to go.
[01:14:58.948 --> 01:15:00.909]  BeachCamera.com.
[01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:01.750]  That's another one.
[01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:03.011]  Let me click News here.
[01:15:03.051 --> 01:15:05.292]  I'm just doing this to illustrate that you can get this for yourself.
[01:15:07.233 --> 01:15:07.553]  Here it is.
[01:15:07.593 --> 01:15:08.434]  Palm Beach Post.
[01:15:08.534 --> 01:15:11.016]  Patrols not cameras for beach surveillance.
[01:15:11.976 --> 01:15:16.019]  And it says that the talking cameras are $5,500 a piece.
[01:15:16.419 --> 01:15:18.180]  They're wired into the police station.
[01:15:19.201 --> 01:15:22.923]  And they will watch what you do and then shout orders at you.
[01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:30.429]  Now, this is the exact same thing that England, four years ago, put in a couple thousand in London.
[01:15:30.849 --> 01:15:34.211]  Now, last time I checked, there were hundreds of thousands.
[01:15:34.812 --> 01:15:38.393]  They've even got these in Sheffield, where Paul Watson lives, his brother Steve's in London.
[01:15:39.154 --> 01:15:47.178]  And if you accidentally, a piece of paper falls out of your backpack, or papers are on the hood of your car, or blow out, I mean this happens to me every week,
[01:15:48.027 --> 01:15:49.048]  And this has even been in the news.
[01:15:49.188 --> 01:15:50.088]  It starts shouting.
[01:15:50.509 --> 01:15:55.472]  And it says, I'm taking photos of you with a digital driver's license and ID systems.
[01:15:55.532 --> 01:15:56.353]  It has your face.
[01:15:56.633 --> 01:15:58.254]  They will even shout and tell you that.
[01:15:58.835 --> 01:16:01.156]  Now some of them are hooked into the software to know who you are.
[01:16:01.176 --> 01:16:04.358]  Of course, they've also been malfunctioning in places.
[01:16:04.739 --> 01:16:05.919]  Where did I see a malfunctioning?
[01:16:05.979 --> 01:16:06.300]  It was in...
[01:16:09.588 --> 01:16:12.790]  I remember it used to be photographic and it used to be perfect and I can't remember.
[01:16:12.850 --> 01:16:13.831]  It's uh... Tampa!
[01:16:13.871 --> 01:16:14.151]  Tampa!
[01:16:14.171 --> 01:16:14.451]  Tampa!
[01:16:14.492 --> 01:16:14.772]  Tampa!
[01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:17.914]  Yeah, malfunctioning with the face scans and arresting and SWAT teaming.
[01:16:18.174 --> 01:16:25.379]  Some guy's out eating at a corner cafe and it face scans him as a big criminal so they SWAT team him and it's the wrong guy.
[01:16:25.419 --> 01:16:28.722]  Another guy is a construction worker working on the street in Tampa.
[01:16:28.742 --> 01:16:29.242]  They got him.
[01:16:29.282 --> 01:16:31.584]  But, side issue here.
[01:16:32.344 --> 01:16:37.428]  See, I ought to just generalize here, but I want people to know I'm specifically going off articles and documents and news.
[01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:40.422]  Okay, let me just read it here.
[01:16:42.122 --> 01:16:44.824]  Patrols Not Cameras for Beach Surveillance.
[01:16:47.105 --> 01:16:48.666]  This is Saturday, November 24th.
[01:16:51.987 --> 01:17:00.472]  It says, the stories about Senator Larry Craig and Representative Bob Allen, if they have a reason to sell it to you, must really have gotten to someone in Martin County.
[01:17:01.672 --> 01:17:07.135]  What else explains the nutty idea to put cameras on beaches to scare or catch people looking for sex?
[01:17:08.129 --> 01:17:13.411]  And then it goes on to say, uh, consider the cost and consider what they want to do.
[01:17:13.471 --> 01:17:18.934]  They say it's the equivalent of 30 sheriff's deputies, 20 firefighters in next year's budget.
[01:17:19.914 --> 01:17:25.817]  Uh, but they say it doesn't matter that the new cameras shout orders at you and track and watch what you're doing.
[01:17:25.857 --> 01:17:26.497]  You can go read it.
[01:17:26.737 --> 01:17:28.658]  Patrol's not cameras for beach surveillance.
[01:17:28.678 --> 01:17:33.440]  There's actually 515 articles on it.
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.381]  Google will tell you how many there are that match that.
[01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:35.381]  515.
[01:17:35.421 --> 01:17:36.542]  Just go read it for yourself.
[01:17:38.599 --> 01:17:46.745]  So, they're putting these in, and they're in Tampa, they're in Palm Beach...
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:55.106]  And I've seen federal grants for them going back six, seven years ago in other parts of the country, but haven't heard about them being used yet.
[01:17:55.466 --> 01:17:56.287]  It's like Texas.
[01:17:56.447 --> 01:18:01.531]  Austin got an $844,000 a year grant consecutively for the next six years.
[01:18:01.631 --> 01:18:08.537]  I didn't look to see if in 2004 it ended, to put up microphones, thousands of microphones per $844,000.
[01:18:09.758 --> 01:18:14.962]  And now all I know is most of the cameras in Austin have shotgun mics.
[01:18:15.562 --> 01:18:27.025]  And then I went to the company that sold it to Austin, mentioned in the bids they put out after the grant, and they bragged you could click on audio and listen to people 200 yards away.
[01:18:27.065 --> 01:18:29.365]  And it was demonstrations of that.
[01:18:30.906 --> 01:18:33.346]  So where I live, now I never heard about them using them yet.
[01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:34.527]  I don't know what they're doing.
[01:18:34.547 --> 01:18:36.527]  I mean, I know it's a military control grid.
[01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.928]  MIT admits they designed it, you know, the overall grid.
[01:18:40.106 --> 01:18:43.570]  They also have hidden camera and microphone boxes they've sold by the millions.
[01:18:43.851 --> 01:18:44.451]  The millions.
[01:18:45.453 --> 01:18:47.095]  When we come back, I'll tell you about something even worse.
[01:18:53.269 --> 01:18:54.310]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:18:54.711 --> 01:19:00.196]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:19:00.777 --> 01:19:01.257]  That's right.
[01:19:01.577 --> 01:19:03.880]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:11.347]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:19:11.903 --> 01:19:19.611]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:19:20.051 --> 01:19:24.836]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:19:25.530 --> 01:19:30.535]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:31.336 --> 01:19:35.480]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:19:35.841 --> 01:19:36.081]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:36.101 --> 01:19:38.043]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:19:38.123 --> 01:19:38.403]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:19:38.724 --> 01:19:38.984]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:51.425 --> 01:19:53.087]  You wear a seatbelt in your car.
[01:19:53.367 --> 01:19:54.649]  At home, you lock the doors.
[01:19:54.929 --> 01:19:56.651]  How about when you use your cell phone?
[01:19:56.851 --> 01:19:58.032]  How do you protect yourself?
[01:19:58.333 --> 01:20:03.959]  EMFs, or electromagnetic frequencies, act like an invisible pollution that surrounds us every day.
[01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:10.346]  Studies link EMFs to many ailments, from stress to depression, anxiety, decreased mental performance,
[01:20:13.789 --> 01:20:18.593]  More than ever, we are fatigued, sick, emotionally depleted and generally stressed out.
[01:20:18.734 --> 01:20:23.318]  Have you ever thought about the impact on your health from exposure to EMFs using your cell phone?
[01:20:23.498 --> 01:20:30.405]  Studies show that 30 minutes a day on a cell phone over the span of one year is equivalent to sticking your head in a microwave for 30 minutes.
[01:20:31.065 --> 01:20:37.369]  Installing the BioPro cell phone chip utilizes patented noise field technology to block harmful EMF pollution.
[01:20:37.589 --> 01:20:38.449]  Still not convinced?
[01:20:38.609 --> 01:20:44.553]  Go to ElectroPollution.org right now to purchase the extremely affordable BioPro cell chip.
[01:20:44.653 --> 01:20:46.834]  It attaches easily to the outside of your phone.
[01:20:47.114 --> 01:20:50.116]  Educate and protect yourself at ElectroPollution.org
[01:20:51.349 --> 01:20:53.472]  Gasoline prices are out of control!
[01:20:53.832 --> 01:20:56.896]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:20:57.156 --> 01:21:01.741]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:21:02.102 --> 01:21:04.725]  Very few customers even know such products exist.
[01:21:05.265 --> 01:21:11.953]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing the oil companies have run, yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:21:12.393 --> 01:21:17.616]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:21:18.076 --> 01:21:19.717]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:21:20.237 --> 01:21:23.519]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:21:24.099 --> 01:21:27.441]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the U.S.
[01:21:27.481 --> 01:21:33.885]  was so incredibly strong that we're allowing GCN listeners to receive a free bottle when one is purchased at our regular price of $9.99.
[01:21:34.825 --> 01:21:40.228]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings, we'll refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:21:40.548 --> 01:21:41.849]  Share the oil company's secrets
[01:21:41.869 --> 01:21:43.432]  Call 800 and get SFR now!
[01:21:43.692 --> 01:21:44.193]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.
[01:21:44.213 --> 01:21:44.794]  That's 888-873-7371 today!
[01:21:51.112 --> 01:21:52.793]  Do you need an easier way to stay in touch?
[01:21:53.073 --> 01:21:54.754]  A two-way radio may be for you.
[01:21:54.954 --> 01:21:58.976]  Two-way radios provide short-range communication with no recurring service charges.
[01:21:59.177 --> 01:22:02.218]  Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hunting, and skiing.
[01:22:02.378 --> 01:22:06.221]  Great for amusement parks, cruises, or just keeping up with the kids around the neighborhood.
[01:22:06.361 --> 01:22:08.762]  Two-way radios can also make your business more efficient.
[01:22:08.882 --> 01:22:12.124]  Cut costs while increasing productivity in doctor and dental offices.
[01:22:12.244 --> 01:22:12.504]  I think so.
[01:22:28.038 --> 01:22:28.699]  We're good to go.
[01:22:58.215 --> 01:23:03.719]  Every move we make, they're watching us, cracking us, getting psychological profiles on us.
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:05.641]  Land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:23:06.141 --> 01:23:10.284]  Every breath you take.
[01:23:10.524 --> 01:23:14.147]  Every move you make.
[01:23:14.367 --> 01:23:15.988]  Every point you make.
[01:23:16.108 --> 01:23:19.131]  Every step you take.
[01:23:19.191 --> 01:23:22.113]  I'll be watching you.
[01:23:22.253 --> 01:23:25.636]  Every single day.
[01:23:26.016 --> 01:23:27.117]  Every word you say.
[01:23:39.963 --> 01:23:43.325]  I'm going to get into the police cars, tracking everything we do.
[01:23:44.807 --> 01:23:45.127]  Next.
[01:23:45.387 --> 01:23:47.268]  First, Coco Mojo.
[01:23:48.089 --> 01:23:52.532]  The healthy immune system boosting hot chocolate, inner health botanicals, new product.
[01:23:52.953 --> 01:23:56.836]  Makers of Interfood, which we all dig here in the office.
[01:23:57.156 --> 01:23:58.757]  Best green food out there, bar none.
[01:23:58.797 --> 01:23:59.378]  Best tasting.
[01:23:59.698 --> 01:24:00.819]  Mix it with your juice in the morning.
[01:24:01.239 --> 01:24:04.201]  Now they have a hot chocolate that has some of these great ingredients.
[01:24:04.902 --> 01:24:08.445]  Just the purified essence of these great plants.
[01:24:10.245 --> 01:24:12.368]  Herbs, absolutely amazing.
[01:24:12.448 --> 01:24:14.591]  Coco Mojo, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:14.631 --> 01:24:22.843]  Great for this holiday season and a great way to get your children to take these, well they're more than just vitamins, they're the actual makeup of the foods.
[01:24:24.275 --> 01:24:24.916]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:24:45.812 --> 01:24:47.554]  And if you buy in bulk, get an additional 20% off.
[01:24:47.574 --> 01:24:47.614]  866-762-9238.
[01:24:47.634 --> 01:24:48.876]  866-762-9238, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:48.896 --> 01:24:49.576]  It is inner food.
[01:24:49.596 --> 01:24:52.820]  Also, when you talk about food, there is eFoods Direct, the great folks at the J. Michael Stevens Group.
[01:25:08.013 --> 01:25:12.577]  And they're the longest continually operating storable foods company in the nation.
[01:25:12.637 --> 01:25:14.838]  It's where I've chosen to get food, buy food twice.
[01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:21.343]  It lasts more than 10 years when stored in a climate controlled area, 10 years when not in your garage or attic or wherever where it's hot.
[01:25:21.663 --> 01:25:23.625]  They're freeze-dried, so they're very contained.
[01:25:23.905 --> 01:25:25.626]  A lot of food in small containers.
[01:25:26.066 --> 01:25:29.269]  You can store your supply for one person in a small area.
[01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:33.112]  Just call and get a free brochure or order their two-month supply to test it out.
[01:25:33.132 --> 01:25:33.652]  1-800-409-5633.
[01:25:33.672 --> 01:25:33.872]  With these
[01:25:36.847 --> 01:25:39.048]  Dangerous times we're in, these uncertain times.
[01:25:39.088 --> 01:25:40.529]  It's a very important thing to do.
[01:25:40.549 --> 01:25:44.251]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com.
[01:25:44.652 --> 01:25:48.674]  Huge banners at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:25:48.694 --> 01:25:51.095]  Naomi Wolf is our scheduled guest in the next segment.
[01:25:51.115 --> 01:25:51.876]  We'll see if she's there.
[01:25:54.117 --> 01:25:55.758]  Again, this is a story
[01:25:57.896 --> 01:26:02.459]  That is out of Popular Mechanics, which is the police state advertisement magazine.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:16.330]  But if you just type in plate reading cop cars, or plate reading cameras, you'll remember this first got in the news six years ago, headlined, Florida Town Runs Plates of All Who Enter.
[01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:19.792]  I believe that's the exact headline, but that'll pull it up for you.
[01:26:21.473 --> 01:26:26.037]  And I had already seen the federal grants in Indiana,
[01:26:27.279 --> 01:26:33.904]  Texas, Ohio, California, New York, Michigan, at that, even before that.
[01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:48.815]  And I told people, here's the federal grants, here's the federal orders, you the great listeners would go around on the federal websites where they publish in the Federal Register all the things they're buying, all the grants they're doing, it's you that does all the research, and I'd cover it, people wouldn't believe me,
[01:26:50.413 --> 01:27:06.683]  Now, I have friends who've gotten in the system for no driver's license or for protesting and who, you know, are battling court cases and it's been in the news with other people I don't know, other states and here in Texas where you're driving down the road, folks, and the minute
[01:27:08.024 --> 01:27:10.947]  That you drive by a car, that's why they swing around and pull you over.
[01:27:11.007 --> 01:27:12.608]  You'll notice they'll have the four cameras.
[01:27:12.628 --> 01:27:16.913]  Two on the front aimed out to the sides and two on the back of the sirens aimed out.
[01:27:16.933 --> 01:27:20.437]  There's a photo here in this Popular Mechanics story for this month.
[01:27:21.077 --> 01:27:26.483]  The top five new generation cop car gadgets.
[01:27:26.843 --> 01:27:30.187]  And number three is automatic license plate recognition cameras.
[01:27:31.756 --> 01:27:36.619]  In any appraisal of high-tech policing, you're bound to brush up against Big Brother-worthy technology.
[01:27:36.979 --> 01:27:51.448]  Case in point, Automatic License Plate Recognition, or ALPR, which is essentially cameras that run every plate they see, according to Brian Shockley, Vice President of Marketing for the Tennessee-based PIPSC Technology, the leading manufacturer.
[01:27:51.468 --> 01:27:53.169]  There's a bunch of them, ALPR.
[01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:56.151]  The most common configuration is a three-camera system.
[01:27:56.171 --> 01:27:57.072]  The one I'm looking at is four.
[01:27:57.552 --> 01:28:00.634]  All of the cameras have a fixed position at focal length.
[01:28:02.642 --> 01:28:12.872]  With two facing forward, one scanning the lane to the right of the car, the other the left lane, and the side-mounted camera to the right of the car, the other scanning the lane to the left.
[01:28:12.892 --> 01:28:13.933]  It goes on.
[01:28:14.033 --> 01:28:24.422]  Each camera sends a consistent stream of infrared and full-color images back to a processor in the trunk, which searches them against current warrant lists, amber alerts, and other records that are updated daily.
[01:28:24.822 --> 01:28:25.343]  Yeah, and
[01:28:26.247 --> 01:28:37.311]  In the Texas legislature four years ago, they tried to pass a law that if you criticize the police, that your DPS intelligence report would go into that database as well.
[01:28:37.351 --> 01:28:38.651]  But you've talked bad about them.
[01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:42.673]  We're on the march.
[01:28:42.693 --> 01:28:44.774]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:44.794 --> 01:28:48.355]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:13.854 --> 01:29:14.415]  I don't think so.

[01:32:03.556 --> 01:32:10.078]  We're here live and restreamed on the web at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:32:11.821 --> 01:32:14.522]  Well, my guest really needs no introduction.
[01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:16.903]  She's a more modern feminist, you could say.
[01:32:16.923 --> 01:32:28.827]  I agree with reports she's put out and analysis she's done about how destructive pornography is for both men and women, and her analysis fits with the scientific reports I've seen, which of course she covered, where
[01:32:29.804 --> 01:32:37.906]  This is what we have her on about today, but I'm saying she's very accomplished about how it doesn't turn men into these raving rapists like people thought it would 50 years ago.
[01:32:37.966 --> 01:32:43.247]  It actually turns them into men who don't interface with the women in their lives and who live in a fantasy land.
[01:32:43.307 --> 01:32:47.268]  It's very destructive for men, not just women, but that's some of the stuff she's written about.
[01:32:47.308 --> 01:32:57.831]  She's written multiple best-selling books, as I'm sure many of you know, and now she has valiantly come out and put out a new book, The End of America.
[01:32:59.327 --> 01:33:07.031]  And she also has written an essay called Fascist America in 10 Easy Steps.
[01:33:07.171 --> 01:33:14.454]  And we have links to Amazon.com where you can get her book and a lot more up on Infowars.com.
[01:33:14.494 --> 01:33:15.895]  Naomi Wolf, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:33:16.435 --> 01:33:18.015]  Thank you so much, Alex, for having me.
[01:33:19.316 --> 01:33:27.940]  When did you start to wake up to the police state that's really accelerated its expansion under the Bush administration in the last seven years?
[01:33:28.849 --> 01:33:57.073]  Yeah, well it was definitely not something I wanted to think about, but I have a friend who's the daughter of Holocaust survivors, and she kept insisting, when we talked about news events, that they did this in Germany, they did this in Germany, and I was sure that this was, you know, very extreme, irrational talk, but she finally forced me to sit down and start reading, and of course I discovered that she wasn't talking about National Socialist outcomes,
[01:33:57.881 --> 01:33:58.902]  You know, 38, 39, 40.
[01:33:59.142 --> 01:34:05.568]  She was talking about 1930, 31, 32, when Germany was a parliamentary democracy.
[01:34:05.588 --> 01:34:06.488]  Yes, a fragile one.
[01:34:06.568 --> 01:34:07.529]  The Weimar Republic.
[01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.710]  Exactly.
[01:34:08.850 --> 01:34:18.778]  But a small group of people began, very systematically, to use the law and dismantle the Constitution and put pressure on citizens to subvert the law.
[01:34:19.018 --> 01:34:21.080]  And that opened the door for everything to follow.
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:23.282]  And then when I started reading this, I saw that not only
[01:34:23.726 --> 01:34:38.833]  Were tactics and strategies being reproduced exactly right now by the Bush administration, but that actual soundbites and language and images and scenarios and sort of film moments are being reproduced.
[01:34:38.913 --> 01:34:51.598]  And then to summarize quickly, I looked at other times and places where a would-be dictator, whether on the left or the right, wanted to close down a democracy or crush a pro-democracy movement.
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:35:07.649]  And I looked at Italy in the 20s, I mentioned Germany in the 30s, Russia in the 30s, East Germany in the 50s, Czechoslovakia in the 60s, China's crackdown on the democracy movement in the 80s, Pinochet's coup in Chile in 1973, and what I saw, Alex, was that there is a blueprint!
[01:35:07.769 --> 01:35:16.614]  I mean, that everybody who wants to close down a democracy does the exact ten things, the ten classic steps, and that unfortunately,
[01:35:17.014 --> 01:35:21.319]  I'm sorry to say we're seeing each of these 10 steps being put in place in the United States today.
[01:35:21.539 --> 01:35:34.654]  And you pointed out, and I've interviewed actual special forces colonels, commanders from Vietnam and other places where this has been carried out, and people who are involved in death squads in Latin America, that our own government, not just the School of Americas for Latin America,
[01:35:35.394 --> 01:35:35.715]  Thank you.
[01:35:54.159 --> 01:35:57.961]  Yeah, it's very, very distressing, especially if you're a patriot.
[01:35:58.161 --> 01:36:09.446]  And, you know, we can live in this bubble, as I did until I was, you know, 43 and started researching this, where you really think, you know, we are a force for good in the world, and we should be, and often we are.
[01:36:09.506 --> 01:36:11.767]  But what you've just said is horrifically true.
[01:36:11.807 --> 01:36:16.029]  I'm sorry to say that the great dictators, you know, Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler, developed this
[01:36:16.611 --> 01:36:28.438]  A practice that is so effective, and then what happened was petty dictators in the second half of the 20th century and up until the present learn it, study it, transmit it, and unfortunately you're 100% right.
[01:36:28.478 --> 01:36:42.025]  The School for the Americas, under our auspices, teaches would-be dictators, especially in Latin American countries, how to set up their own death squads, suppress dissent in their own countries, crack down, round up journalists in their own countries.
[01:36:42.305 --> 01:36:43.186]  No, no, no, going back!
[01:37:03.801 --> 01:37:08.126]  happening right now at home that democracy activists all over the world can recognize.
[01:37:08.146 --> 01:37:13.072]  And they're going, oh my god, no, you know, don't let the executive have more power to declare martial law.
[01:37:13.172 --> 01:37:18.939]  Don't let the executive have more power to round up his political opponents and put them in solitary confinement for three years.
[01:37:20.131 --> 01:37:49.254]  Now, going back to the roots of this with Hitler, and he was of course expanding on other systems of control, going back to the Romans, he adopted a lot of the, and I've read Heinz Hobel's Word of the Dead said, a lot of the Jesuits' systems for controlling countries, and so Hitler was building on a lot of sciences that had been developed before he came along, but I'm sure you know this, and I haven't finished your book yet, and I'm wondering if it's in there, that Prescott Bush was actually the head Nazi agent in the U.S., the McCormick-Dickstein committees exposed this,
[01:37:49.774 --> 01:37:57.400]  The guy that was about to be the Marine Corps Commandant, Brigadier General Smedley Butler, they tried to hire him to overthrow the government and set up a fascist dictatorship.
[01:37:57.821 --> 01:38:07.809]  So to see Bush even calling it homeland security, it was fatherland security there, setting up a homeland security, which is the Gestapo slash SS, I mean they're really going down the line.
[01:38:07.849 --> 01:38:15.335]  And when you learn, and I'm asking did you know this, that the Bush's actually got their first seed money from Fritz Thiessen, the man who bankrolled Hitler.
[01:38:16.906 --> 01:38:42.162]  Well, I have to say, as you're speaking, you know, I'm very rarely at a loss for words, Alex, but I'm so kind of overwhelmed with emotion from what you just said, because you're the first mainstream talker to say this truth, which is, you know, historically 100% accurate and profoundly important for people to understand.
[01:38:43.043 --> 01:38:44.744]  There was an attempted coup.
[01:38:44.804 --> 01:38:45.184]  Are you there?
[01:38:46.406 --> 01:38:47.266]  Yes, I'm here, Naomi.
[01:38:47.366 --> 01:38:47.686]  Okay.
[01:38:47.946 --> 01:39:13.894]  There was, as you just said very bravely to thousands of listeners, there was a scheme in the 30s, and Prescott Bush was one of the leaders of this scheme, industrialist, who admired fascism and who thought it was a good idea to have a coup in the United States along the lines of the coup that they saw taking place so profitably for corporations in Italy and in Germany.
[01:39:14.835 --> 01:39:28.112]  A hundred percent right that Smedley Butler, and actually I have a good friend who's reporting this out and has access to the original document, so he's telling me about Smedley Butler even as you're speaking, so it's like this, you know, truth is just like coming out all over the place.
[01:39:28.433 --> 01:39:31.557]  Smedley Butler had gone along with violent regime change
[01:39:32.279 --> 01:39:32.620]  I don't think so.
[01:39:50.363 --> 01:39:51.824]  I think we're good to go.
[01:40:10.527 --> 01:40:20.116]  were about to be brought to trial and sent to prison, there was a moment at which they were going to look into turning the spotlight on their American partners.
[01:40:20.396 --> 01:40:37.331]  And that's why when I look at the laws that the Bush White House has drafted, like the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which are so consciously designed to protect Bush and his co-conspirators from being indicted for war crimes, just as the Nuremberg conspirators were indicted for war crimes,
[01:40:37.792 --> 01:40:37.892]  Yes.
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:41:07.738]  A corporate interest with a fascist state that violently represses people, and that's why when I saw, you know, the recycling of so much Nazi language, Nazi tactics, Nazi strategies, Nazi imagery in the Bush White House, and then finally, belatedly, people brought to me this history of the Prescott Bush attempt to coup and Smedley Butler's revelations, it just gave me absolute chills.
[01:41:07.778 --> 01:41:09.439]  It gives me chills to hear you say it out loud.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:12.802]  Is this the first time you've spoken about it?
[01:41:14.383 --> 01:41:14.583]  I have
[01:41:15.794 --> 01:41:26.326]  I've sort of skirted the issue as I've been waiting to get enough research that is sound to have a public conversation about it.
[01:41:27.421 --> 01:41:31.263]  You have very bravely sort of dragged the subject out into a public conversation.
[01:41:31.323 --> 01:41:34.424]  I'm now confident enough of the data to confirm exactly what you're saying.
[01:41:34.444 --> 01:41:47.089]  Well, I mean, just so you know, I've been covering this ever since I got on air 13 years ago, and I've had a lot of historians on who really first codified this and put this together, but just
[01:41:48.084 --> 01:41:53.070]  Just so you know, if you go to Google Video, no need to buy the DVD from InfoWars.com.
[01:41:53.310 --> 01:41:54.452]  That would be nice.
[01:41:54.492 --> 01:41:55.573]  I'll send you one for listeners.
[01:41:55.613 --> 01:41:57.976]  It's nice to have the high quality digital DVD.
[01:41:58.436 --> 01:42:05.064]  If you go to Google and type Marshall Law in and click Video Naomi, I made a three hour film about this.
[01:42:05.104 --> 01:42:06.366]  The last hour is about it.
[01:42:07.226 --> 01:42:10.948]  Yeah, and so no need to watch the first two hours, it's about other things.
[01:42:11.248 --> 01:42:19.612]  But you can fast forward to the last hour, and we have, but since we brought this out, the London Guardian's reported, the BBC has reported,
[01:42:21.119 --> 01:42:26.061]  And BBC Radio and TV, so it's now... You're the guy who brought it out that the BBC picked it up from?
[01:42:26.101 --> 01:42:26.842]  That's amazing!
[01:42:26.882 --> 01:42:29.543]  Well, no, no, let me give credit where credit's due.
[01:42:30.603 --> 01:42:48.091]  Webster Tarpley, I already read this and talked about it, but Tarpley, about 12 years ago, did the main research, and then Mr. Buchanan, who I interviewed for the film with John Buchanan, he actually went to verify, and we went with him, to the National Archives.
[01:42:48.801 --> 01:42:49.622]  Oh my God!
[01:42:50.343 --> 01:43:01.332]  And since then we've gotten the actual clips of newsreel 18mm footage from the McCormick-Dickstein committee.
[01:43:01.352 --> 01:43:01.392]  No!
[01:43:01.912 --> 01:43:02.753]  You're kidding!
[01:43:03.213 --> 01:43:05.395]  Oh my God, I've got to see this material.
[01:43:05.715 --> 01:43:07.057]  It's dangerous.
[01:43:07.497 --> 01:43:08.278]  We've got to bring this out.
[01:43:08.318 --> 01:43:16.905]  I've got a friend who is standing by to make a viral film about this to get the word out to Americans because it's one thing to put the pieces together
[01:43:17.478 --> 01:43:31.425]  Theoretically, as I've done in my book, but when you realize that there is a family history, and again, you can't point fingers at a grandson or a great-grandson and say, you know, the pain of the ancestors on the grandson, but it just... But now he's doing it!
[01:43:31.445 --> 01:43:33.606]  It's kind of like saying... Now he's doing it!
[01:43:33.646 --> 01:43:34.406]  That's right!
[01:43:34.506 --> 01:43:45.112]  And it adds a dimensionality of plausibility to something that is, until you have this kind of personal history confirmation, is circumstantial evidence.
[01:43:45.312 --> 01:43:45.832]  Oh my gosh.
[01:43:46.363 --> 01:43:58.726]  Now, I want to, for your research, London Guardian, and then you can expand out from there to BBC, and it was also picked up by three U.S.
[01:43:58.766 --> 01:44:04.127]  newspapers, but they're local dailies, so it's all been vetted out.
[01:44:06.528 --> 01:44:14.770]  Prescott Bush was the main bag man on the board of directors of Fritz Thiessen's Union Carbide and Brown Brother Harriman.
[01:44:15.511 --> 01:44:17.851]  And then after the war, he was the bag man.
[01:44:17.871 --> 01:44:28.014]  And then it gets into Texas history and even family that I talked to who didn't know what they were seeing in Midland after World War II, but was telling me about this when I was a little kid.
[01:44:28.294 --> 01:44:31.995]  And now all this comes out about how there were all these Nazis everywhere.
[01:44:32.095 --> 01:44:35.116]  And it just, it just... You know, Alex, you're kidding me.
[01:44:35.456 --> 01:44:38.499]  Can we talk afterwards and follow up more about this?
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:39.140]  Absolutely.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.863]  I get off at about 3 Eastern.
[01:44:41.943 --> 01:44:43.505]  I don't know what time zone you're in.
[01:44:43.865 --> 01:44:49.351]  This is really important because, truly, what is so disturbing about the research that I found
[01:44:50.035 --> 01:44:50.695]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:44:50.755 --> 01:44:51.235]  So the first...
[01:45:13.143 --> 01:45:16.004]  I'm sorry, I'm just like, still reeling from what you're saying.
[01:45:16.024 --> 01:45:17.164]  Well, I understand, yeah.
[01:45:17.284 --> 01:45:17.725]  It's big.
[01:45:17.805 --> 01:45:20.466]  I mean, also, I'm not putting these pieces together.
[01:45:20.486 --> 01:45:37.271]  I want to be super clear about this, but I just got off an interview where, for the first time, I also said in public, you know, that citizens should be able to ask any questions they want about 9-11, and that it's not a good sign in a democracy when there are some questions that are off-limits.
[01:45:37.711 --> 01:45:41.913]  And I made it super clear that I'm not drawing any kind of conclusions, but that
[01:45:42.478 --> 01:45:48.700]  Um, you know, in a strong democracy, if citizens call for more investigation of a major crime, there's more investigation.
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:54.402]  Well, did you know that Glenn Beck and Bill O'Reilly have said that Ron Paul supporters are working for Al Qaeda?
[01:45:54.662 --> 01:45:58.004]  And Glenn Beck called for the military to be used against citizens last week?
[01:45:58.784 --> 01:45:59.524]  Oh my God.
[01:45:59.844 --> 01:46:00.104]  No, I did not.
[01:46:00.124 --> 01:46:01.245]  You can actually watch the video.
[01:46:01.265 --> 01:46:01.805]  Yeah, it's on...
[01:46:03.007 --> 01:46:03.407]  Why?
[01:46:03.447 --> 01:46:05.789]  Now Ron Paul supports it because they're for the Constitution?
[01:46:07.270 --> 01:46:08.972]  They're calling us domestic enemies.
[01:46:09.753 --> 01:46:14.096]  I had the Congress follow on last week about it, and we can even play the clips, but we're running out of time.
[01:46:14.817 --> 01:46:16.298]  But yes, they're now saying this.
[01:46:17.648 --> 01:46:20.109]  That's really scary, and they called out the military against them?
[01:46:20.369 --> 01:46:41.794]  Well, they said, we need to consider using the military, and then if you read, yes, against citizens, and then if you read, saying we're a domestic threat, and then if you read the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, it says, it funds martial law for domestic insurrection by the citizenry, and then in PDD 51, Bush says that he's above continuity of government, not Congress.
[01:46:42.334 --> 01:46:43.034]  Yes, that's right.
[01:46:43.780 --> 01:46:52.671]  Well, that is super scary because I know that they're training FBI agents right now to identify people who are critical of the administration as terrorists, which is something right out of the Stalinist era.
[01:46:53.180 --> 01:46:59.882]  Playbook, and in fact Norman Podhortz's new book identifies people like me and you, obviously, as quote-unquote domestic insurgents.
[01:47:00.342 --> 01:47:09.084]  And, you know, in a fascist shift, what I call a fascist shift, that's step eight and nine, which is to start identifying critics of the regime, or critics of the cadre in power.
[01:47:09.104 --> 01:47:10.984]  But here's the good news, Naomi.
[01:47:11.064 --> 01:47:11.544]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:11.664 --> 01:47:12.605]  Here's the good news.
[01:47:13.065 --> 01:47:14.585]  Hitler did it, it was popular.
[01:47:14.625 --> 01:47:17.226]  They're doing it and totally blowing their cover.
[01:47:17.466 --> 01:47:18.546]  That, I think, is the good news.
[01:47:19.404 --> 01:47:36.610]  That is good news, but until there's a revolution, like starting yesterday, of American patriots across the political spectrum to investigate, identify these crimes, prosecute, and put these people in jail, because impeachment, the historical record shows, is not safe enough for people who are this kind of violent.
[01:47:36.630 --> 01:47:36.850]  I agree.
[01:47:36.890 --> 01:47:38.110]  No, no, this is life and death.
[01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:41.691]  Invoke the terrifying internal or external enemy.
[01:47:41.731 --> 01:47:43.272]  And 9-11, let's go through them.
[01:47:44.592 --> 01:47:50.778]  All would-be dictators, left or right, invoke a terrifying internal and external enemy, often a real one that they will hype and manipulate.
[01:47:51.098 --> 01:48:01.066]  The second thing they always do is create a secret prison system that is outside the rule of law, by secret I mean unaccountable, where torture takes place and they often create military commissions.
[01:48:01.387 --> 01:48:09.894]  There's always a blurring of the line where they start by torturing people seen as at the margins of society and then inevitably move into directing state abuse against
[01:48:10.359 --> 01:48:10.740]  I don't know.
[01:48:24.688 --> 01:48:32.112]  And they're now trying to introduce that idea as a White House talking point we got that anti-war libertarians, liberals are aiding terrorists and should be banned.
[01:48:45.606 --> 01:48:45.987]  Lovely.
[01:48:46.107 --> 01:48:47.268]  I mean, this is just predictable.
[01:48:47.308 --> 01:48:48.470]  The blueprint is predictable.
[01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:56.180]  You could tell six months ago that this was ahead, and what's interesting to me, also historically predictable, is as people start to wake up,
[01:48:56.744 --> 01:49:00.227]  The regime is starting to ramp down, because it is a race against time.
[01:49:00.247 --> 01:49:01.028]  Like, who's going to win?
[01:49:01.288 --> 01:49:07.974]  Are we going to wake up in time and put them in prison, or are they going to get us, you know, and push us past the point of no return, which is very quick.
[01:49:08.274 --> 01:49:10.836]  Boy, you are certainly on the same page as I am.
[01:49:10.856 --> 01:49:11.557]  Oh my goodness.
[01:49:11.957 --> 01:49:12.298]  Yeah.
[01:49:12.778 --> 01:49:13.959]  Alright, well let's hope we win.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:19.264]  The third thing they always do is create a paramilitary force that is not answerable to the citizens.
[01:49:19.504 --> 01:49:20.085]  Blackwater.
[01:49:20.105 --> 01:49:22.607]  Blackwater, exactly, and they are operating
[01:49:23.207 --> 01:49:37.881]  In the United States right now, there are hand-selected torturers and murderers from regimes like Chile, Pinochet's guys, El Salvador, Nigeria, where they torture their own citizens, and they're opening training grounds in Illinois.
[01:49:38.141 --> 01:49:40.103]  Naomi, we'll stay there.
[01:49:40.123 --> 01:49:41.424]  We're going to come right back.
[01:49:41.444 --> 01:49:43.166]  We're going to keep her five minutes to the next hour.
[01:49:43.186 --> 01:49:48.110]  Then we have a guest coming on with the secret history of education and the big foundations.
[01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:48.671]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:51.627 --> 01:49:53.028]  It is a big idea.
[01:49:53.048 --> 01:49:55.150]  A New World Order.
[01:49:55.851 --> 01:50:00.115]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[01:50:00.775 --> 01:50:03.538]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:50:03.578 --> 01:50:05.840]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:08.842]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:50:09.563 --> 01:50:16.909]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:50:19.884 --> 01:50:24.867]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:50:25.348 --> 01:50:28.830]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:50:29.210 --> 01:50:31.732]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[01:50:31.792 --> 01:50:32.933]  Most people have no idea.
[01:50:32.953 --> 01:50:33.693]  They're not after money.
[01:50:33.733 --> 01:50:34.814]  They have all the money they need.
[01:50:35.014 --> 01:50:35.775]  They're after power.
[01:50:35.995 --> 01:50:37.015]  That's what I have to use it for.
[01:50:37.156 --> 01:50:45.341]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:50:45.501 --> 01:50:48.443]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:50:48.663 --> 01:50:49.724]  You have been warned.
[01:50:50.824 --> 01:50:56.046]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:56.186 --> 01:51:04.289]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:04.529 --> 01:51:11.592]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:11.732 --> 01:51:12.433]  We're good to go!
[01:51:40.515 --> 01:51:57.987]  Hi, I'm Lynette Brooks, founder of MediCleanse, the original colon cleanse combining the healing power of flaxseed with the detoxification of bentonite clay.
[01:51:58.307 --> 01:52:04.331]  In a perfect world, we would eat natural healthy foods, but the foods we eat today are not the foods nature intended for us.
[01:52:04.772 --> 01:52:06.393]  Fast food is toxic food.
[01:52:06.793 --> 01:52:10.434]  I've been producing MediCleans for over 20 years, and customers from across the U.S.
[01:52:10.474 --> 01:52:18.797]  say that MediCleans helps your body detoxify from fast foods as well as other environmental poisons, such as heavy metals and pesticides in the intestinal tract.
[01:52:19.137 --> 01:52:21.678]  For centuries, flax has been known as nature's superfood.
[01:52:22.158 --> 01:52:29.160]  Even the FDA says flaxseed works to prevent cancer and helps with menopause, weight loss, irritable bowel syndrome, and constipation.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:33.684]  A one-month supply of MediCleanse is available online at MediCleanse.com.
[01:52:33.784 --> 01:52:39.631]  That's M-E-T-A-C-L-E-A-N-S-E dot com for only $22.95 plus shipping and handling.

[01:52:40.772 --> 01:52:40.952]  That's 800-317-9547.
[01:52:41.032 --> 01:52:42.794]  Radiant health has never been easier.
[01:52:55.695 --> 01:52:57.056]  Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:52:57.076 --> 01:52:58.596]  Don't forget my new film, Endgame.
[01:52:58.616 --> 01:53:01.257]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement is out on DVD.
[01:53:01.897 --> 01:53:05.638]  It's gone as high as, what, 18 on the Amazon Video Charts.
[01:53:05.938 --> 01:53:08.659]  Number one documentary for a week straight.
[01:53:08.879 --> 01:53:13.281]  And Loose Change Final Cut, which I'm the executive producer of,
[01:53:14.159 --> 01:53:15.539]  Totally new film, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:15.559 --> 01:53:16.520]  Just been out for two weeks.
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:19.661]  Available on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[01:53:19.721 --> 01:53:20.441]  Not on Amazon.
[01:53:20.921 --> 01:53:21.661]  One place to get it.
[01:53:22.002 --> 01:53:26.503]  PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:53:28.123 --> 01:53:32.085]  Well, I mean, she's an amazing lady and just very well versed in so many subjects.
[01:53:32.105 --> 01:53:34.425]  We're going to have her for five minutes into the next hour.
[01:53:34.445 --> 01:53:40.047]  It's clear I'm going to have to get her back up for a full hour if she'll grace us with that much time in the near future.
[01:53:40.067 --> 01:53:42.368]  Naomi, continuing with the steps.
[01:53:43.297 --> 01:53:43.617]  Sure.
[01:53:44.277 --> 01:53:47.359]  So paramilitary forced outside the rule of law Blackwater.
[01:53:47.399 --> 01:54:02.484]  They can show up tomorrow outside our doors to crack down on civil society with, as you mentioned, the Defense Authorization Act of 2007, which gives the President the power to declare a public emergency, federalize the National Guard over the objections of governors.
[01:54:02.644 --> 01:54:04.685]  And it says for insurrection.
[01:54:04.765 --> 01:54:06.286]  It says for the American people.
[01:54:07.066 --> 01:54:07.206]  Yep.
[01:54:08.132 --> 01:54:10.235]  Yeah, he can do that tomorrow because he says so.
[01:54:10.796 --> 01:54:17.667]  The fourth thing you need to close down an open society is to direct a surveillance apparatus at ordinary citizens.
[01:54:18.061 --> 01:54:30.930]  And by the way, there's a huge profit incentive, because in the wake of the Cold War, the third of the economy that was making Cold War weapons, like Boeing and Raytheon, needed to, you know, they were looking at declining market share, unless they could find a new enemy.
[01:54:30.990 --> 01:54:31.490]  That's right.
[01:54:31.510 --> 01:54:34.692]  First they had the Soviets, now they have the Arabs, now it's going to be us.
[01:54:35.012 --> 01:54:43.618]  Rand and others have said this, and then it integrates it, just like many of your new student packages that the students get.
[01:54:44.879 --> 01:54:47.781]  Scholarships are for this whole apparatus.
[01:54:48.441 --> 01:54:58.967]  Exactly, and they've got, so now there's billions of profits to be made if we hype a global enemy, if we turn the quote-unquote war on terror into something much bigger than it really is.
[01:54:59.409 --> 01:55:09.716]  And if we turn the enemy into us, because then they're creating the surveillance and security technologies now, they have lobbyists who sit down with Homeland Security and write the laws and the policies.
[01:55:09.796 --> 01:55:18.102]  So, you know, that's why when our organization tried, the American Freedom Campaign, tried to get the presidential candidates to stand up for the Constitution,
[01:55:18.672 --> 01:55:26.094]  The people who are not frontrunners on the left did so right away, but the frontrunners hesitated, and only Ron Paul has pledged it on the right.
[01:55:26.174 --> 01:55:26.714]  Why is that?
[01:55:26.954 --> 01:55:41.098]  Because it is now expensive to stand up for the rights of American citizens, if you're a frontrunner, because there are billions to be made for major donors who are the telecommunications and the surveillance and security technologies industries.
[01:55:41.158 --> 01:55:46.319]  And by the way, this only accelerates once you go into this paradigm of the predatory economy, it only gets bigger.
[01:55:47.299 --> 01:55:48.600]  Yeah, that's really scary.
[01:55:48.620 --> 01:56:03.307]  I mean, what we saw the model in Italy and Germany, someone just pointed out in their right, that now there are technologies that can amplify control and terror of civilians massively or that can be used to liberate civilians.
[01:56:03.547 --> 01:56:10.050]  Have you heard they're now putting in cameras all over, first in England, that shout orders at you and they have police cars that scan everyone's plates?
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:11.340]  Oh my lord.
[01:56:11.400 --> 01:56:12.801]  I knew about the scanning of the plates.
[01:56:12.861 --> 01:56:14.161]  I did know about the shouting orders.
[01:56:14.181 --> 01:56:15.102]  That's very disturbing.
[01:56:15.202 --> 01:56:15.482]  Yes.
[01:56:15.622 --> 01:56:19.143]  Number five, because I know you want me to get through these quickly if I can.
[01:56:19.163 --> 01:56:19.483]  Go ahead.
[01:56:19.503 --> 01:56:21.184]  Infiltrate citizens' groups.
[01:56:22.104 --> 01:56:27.866]  Oh, by the way, the surveillance, the TSA watch list and the no-fly list started out 45,000 U.S.
[01:56:27.886 --> 01:56:28.267]  citizens.
[01:56:28.447 --> 01:56:29.107]  I'm one of them.
[01:56:29.587 --> 01:56:34.109]  Many critics of the administration are on the watch list, but it's gone up to 775,000 American citizens.
[01:56:34.129 --> 01:56:35.389]  20,000 names added every month.
[01:56:40.453 --> 01:56:47.257]  And these are people who are environmental activists, anti-war activists, decorated war heroes who are critical of the Iraq War.
[01:56:47.297 --> 01:56:48.137]  Unbelievable!
[01:56:48.157 --> 01:56:48.858]  Unbelievable!
[01:56:48.898 --> 01:56:59.664]  The issue with this, Alex, is that people come up to me in tears after I speak about this because they wrote a letter to their local newspaper critical of Bush, their kids get put on a watch list.
[01:57:00.663 --> 01:57:04.544]  Now again, folks, if we give in, and this is admitted, we always knew they had lists.
[01:57:05.085 --> 01:57:06.065]  Now they're public.
[01:57:06.125 --> 01:57:07.325]  This is the intimidation.
[01:57:07.405 --> 01:57:09.866]  If we give in, they win.
[01:57:10.206 --> 01:57:16.329]  The only problem is they put so many people on it now, they're letting you fly most of the time, so they put too many on it.
[01:57:16.929 --> 01:57:17.749]  Stay there, Naomi Wolf.
[01:57:17.909 --> 01:57:18.789]  Oh, I wish we had you longer.
[01:57:18.849 --> 01:57:21.090]  Five more minutes after this 60-second break.
[01:57:21.330 --> 01:57:22.731]  We'll get into the other four points.
[01:57:23.291 --> 01:57:25.152]  Her new book is The End of America.
[01:57:25.452 --> 01:57:26.472]  Folks, this is it.
[01:57:26.532 --> 01:57:27.472]  They're making their move.
[01:57:27.552 --> 01:57:28.273]  It's not a joke.
[01:57:28.313 --> 01:57:28.913]  It's not a game.
[01:57:32.921 --> 01:57:35.828]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:57:36.168 --> 01:57:38.373]  Visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:57:47.434 --> 01:57:48.075]  Big Brother.
[01:57:48.735 --> 01:57:49.816]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:50.497 --> 01:57:51.617]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:52.258 --> 01:57:53.099]  You want answers?
[01:57:53.839 --> 01:57:54.740]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:55.400 --> 01:57:59.364]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:59.584 --> 01:58:03.687]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.290 --> 01:58:16.412]  Well, we're clearly going to get her back up for a full hour in the next few weeks.
[01:58:18.213 --> 01:58:19.534]  She is hot on the trail.
[01:58:19.754 --> 01:58:21.475]  She's learned a lot of stuff I didn't know.
[01:58:21.635 --> 01:58:22.896]  I've got a lot of stuff she didn't know.
[01:58:23.196 --> 01:58:25.437]  This is so big, no one person can know it all.
[01:58:25.457 --> 01:58:27.899]  She's a great person and put out a great book.
[01:58:27.939 --> 01:58:29.320]  You can get it at Amazon.com.
[01:58:29.340 --> 01:58:30.020]  Bookstores everywhere.
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:30.900]  The End of America.
[01:58:32.281 --> 01:58:38.505]  And Naomi, I'm going to send you a lot of these documents and news articles and video clips for yourself today so you can
[01:58:39.611 --> 01:58:39.891]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:39.931 --> 01:58:42.953]  Well, first of all, this is just something I want to say about democracy.
[01:58:42.973 --> 01:58:44.794]  In a living democracy, this is exactly what should be happening.
[01:58:57.026 --> 01:59:06.353]  Bring to one another the information they need to put all the pieces together and don't just trust the elites or trust the regime in power to spoon feed them the information.
[01:59:06.913 --> 01:59:09.735]  Okay, so then infiltrate and harass citizens groups.
[01:59:09.775 --> 01:59:12.838]  The ACLU has many lawsuits noting that people are doing that right now.
[01:59:13.718 --> 01:59:23.806]  You know, every time I speak or you speak, they're likely to be state infiltrators, sort of dressed like audience members, basically taping everything you're saying and ready to get you in trouble if they can.
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:26.760]  The seventh step is to target key individuals.
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:46.744]  Now, this is when you see people like Dan Rather going down because of White House pressure on his employer when he criticizes Bush, when you see Bill Marley lose his job, when you see Valerie Plame get outed, smearing, punitive retributions against people like Jessica Rakoff, a senior lawyer at the Justice Department who said, don't torture John Walker Lynde.
[01:59:47.104 --> 01:59:49.404]  She found that she was referred to the Bar Association.
[01:59:49.424 --> 01:59:51.625]  You're seeing people in Alabama put in prison.
[01:59:51.645 --> 01:59:54.245]  They ratchet up the targeting of key individuals.
[01:59:54.685 --> 01:59:56.906]  Then you get restricting the press.
[01:59:57.066 --> 02:00:01.507]  You see things like Greg Palast, the author, being investigated by Homeland Security.
[02:00:01.547 --> 02:00:03.107]  Oh, they put out an arrest warrant!
[02:00:03.127 --> 02:00:05.128]  They put out an arrest warrant until ABC got on it.
[02:00:06.048 --> 02:00:10.950]  They were trying to arrest... Oh yeah, whenever he went and filmed the camps down in Louisiana.
[02:00:11.030 --> 02:00:12.230]  Oh yeah, that was in the news.
[02:00:12.510 --> 02:00:16.951]  Homeland Security said he had exposed key infrastructure until the press got on it and they dropped it.
[02:00:17.651 --> 02:00:17.931]  Right.
[02:00:18.312 --> 02:00:23.153]  Well, that's super scary because, you know, at this point, you know, one or two or three
[02:00:23.789 --> 02:00:34.637]  There can be an outcry, but when the state starts to issue arrests for journalists, and you hear of 30 or 40 or 50, that's one of those tipping points where it's very difficult to push back.
[02:00:34.978 --> 02:00:39.021]  What I'm trying to stress is that democracy doesn't close down overnight.
[02:00:39.141 --> 02:00:41.222]  It closes down in a series of these tipping points.
[02:00:41.663 --> 02:00:49.869]  So for me personally, when I read, and this is step number 8, recast criticism as espionage and dissent as treason,
[02:00:50.336 --> 02:00:50.637]  I think?
[02:01:03.563 --> 02:01:05.144]  Prosecute him under the Espionage Act.
[02:01:05.484 --> 02:01:08.065]  Well, the penalty for treason is execution.
[02:01:08.426 --> 02:01:21.592]  And I was reading Goebbels when I read this and I got, again, chills because the publisher of Investia in the thirties was charged with treason by Stalin in the third Moscow show trial and was executed for treason.
[02:01:21.652 --> 02:01:23.753]  And the last two, the last two, we've got one minute.
[02:01:23.833 --> 02:01:24.513]  Okay, okay.
[02:01:24.774 --> 02:01:30.797]  The last two are that you, okay, we can't espionage, restrict the press.
[02:01:32.304 --> 02:01:35.473]  You subvert the rule of law and you make it easier to declare martial law.
[02:01:35.493 --> 02:01:37.338]  So that's where you get things like signing statements.
[02:01:37.645 --> 02:01:40.247]  You know, the White House basically saying, I don't care that you're Congress.
[02:01:40.547 --> 02:01:42.289]  I don't care there are two other branches of government.
[02:01:42.909 --> 02:01:47.733]  And you get things like the Defense Authorization Act, which we've discussed, that make it easier to declare martial law.
[02:01:47.773 --> 02:01:50.556]  You try to purge the civil service, as Goebbels did in 1933.
[02:01:50.616 --> 02:01:56.400]  And Naomi, in closing, and if you can hold over, that's fine.
[02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:58.242]  If you can't, I know you probably got to go.
[02:01:58.602 --> 02:02:02.585]  The problem is, is that we're seeing the Democrats go along with this, too.
[02:02:02.926 --> 02:02:05.808]  And so this system's in place, even if Bush leaves office.
[02:02:05.848 --> 02:02:06.749]  How do you respond to that?
[02:02:07.654 --> 02:02:10.857]  Well, it's terrifying and this is what we need to do.
[02:02:10.917 --> 02:02:14.139]  We can't leave it to the Democrats and we can't leave it to Republicans in power.
[02:02:14.159 --> 02:02:14.800]  It's up to us.
[02:02:15.841 --> 02:02:21.325]  History shows it takes a mass uprising of citizens across the political spectrum to rise up.
[02:02:21.605 --> 02:02:25.989]  You go to AmericanFreedomCampaign.com on the right, on the left, American Freedom Agenda.
[02:02:26.522 --> 02:02:27.122]  Naomi, stay there.
[02:02:27.142 --> 02:02:27.462]  Stay there.
[02:02:27.562 --> 02:02:28.063]  We got a break.
[02:02:28.123 --> 02:02:28.303]  Hold on.
[02:02:28.343 --> 02:02:28.823]  It is a big idea.
[02:02:28.843 --> 02:02:29.463]  A new world order.
[02:02:29.483 --> 02:02:31.744]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:02:31.764 --> 02:02:32.664]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:02:55.541 --> 02:02:57.784]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:02:58.325 --> 02:03:00.788]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:03:01.509 --> 02:03:08.858]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:03:11.863 --> 02:03:16.846]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:03:17.327 --> 02:03:20.809]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:23.691]  Bill Burgess makes great progress for the world government.
[02:03:23.751 --> 02:03:24.892]  Most people have no idea.
[02:03:24.912 --> 02:03:25.632]  They're not after money.
[02:03:25.672 --> 02:03:26.753]  They have all the money they need.
[02:03:26.973 --> 02:03:27.694]  They're after power.
[02:03:27.954 --> 02:03:28.794]  That's what I have to do, sir.

[02:04:42.535 --> 02:04:43.416]  Storable food!
[02:04:43.636 --> 02:04:44.496]  Storable food!

[02:05:08.833 --> 02:05:10.774]  The powder will feed the body vital minerals.
[02:05:10.994 --> 02:05:11.494]  We're good to go.
[02:05:38.106 --> 02:05:41.688]  And remember, let your food be your medicine, and your medicine be your food.
[02:05:42.849 --> 02:05:47.892]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:48.252 --> 02:05:50.513]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:11.864 --> 02:06:13.725]  Well, we just had Naomi Wolf on.
[02:06:14.026 --> 02:06:17.708]  She says she's going to go supernova with all of our Bush Nazi info.
[02:06:19.969 --> 02:06:29.235]  But I remember hearing John Taylor Gatto years ago on the radio, and then last week I heard him again, and I just thought, why not get John Taylor Gatto on the show with us?
[02:06:30.636 --> 02:06:39.362]  And because I was listening to him, and I have guests on that basically have discovered the same things I've discovered, but even more.
[02:06:40.057 --> 02:06:47.062]  Because there's so much going on that not one individual of us can be experts, complete experts, on every facet.
[02:06:47.762 --> 02:06:51.845]  I mean, I've interviewed Charlotte Isserby, who was number two at the Department of Education under Reagan.
[02:06:51.885 --> 02:06:53.706]  Her dad was Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove.
[02:06:54.066 --> 02:06:55.407]  She was in the Foreign Service.
[02:06:55.948 --> 02:07:01.291]  They let her into the upper echelon and said, we're here to train people how to not be able to think and control them.
[02:07:02.112 --> 02:07:05.534]  And she'd published a book the size of a phone book full of all the documents, how they're doing it.
[02:07:06.033 --> 02:07:09.434]  And I've interviewed 30, 40, 50 other experts in education.
[02:07:09.814 --> 02:07:11.294]  This is a fact.
[02:07:11.694 --> 02:07:12.954]  This is how they're operating.
[02:07:13.414 --> 02:07:14.454]  This is what they're doing.
[02:07:15.615 --> 02:07:22.796]  But my point is, John Taylor Gatto, when I was listening to him, he was bringing up all these things I knew, but then adding things I hadn't discovered.
[02:07:22.816 --> 02:07:25.016]  And I spot-checked a few things he said, and they checked out.
[02:07:26.216 --> 02:07:29.677]  And that's an example of how deep all of this is.
[02:07:29.697 --> 02:07:35.298]  I mean, he's just done an amazing, amazing job with the secret history of education.
[02:07:36.298 --> 02:07:40.179]  In this country, where it came from, how it developed, and it's the same thing.
[02:07:40.219 --> 02:07:48.903]  And I'm not into credit, just like you heard me tell Naomi Wolf earlier, but people out there in internet land make somewhat of an issue over this.
[02:07:48.943 --> 02:07:55.625]  Well, Alex, you got your information about how the elite want to set up world government to exterminate 80% of us from such and such.
[02:07:56.252 --> 02:08:05.498]  No, I got it from the Globalist Stone documents, and I've been talking about it for 13 years, but certainly there were those before me that did get all this, and I wanted to make the point on air, that doesn't matter.
[02:08:05.638 --> 02:08:06.759]  It's about the info.
[02:08:07.119 --> 02:08:15.685]  That's why I tell listeners and other talk show hosts, other people that are obsessed with this, to just take my info and take my name off of it and say, you did it, if that's what's important to you.
[02:08:17.586 --> 02:08:23.210]  I'm here to give credit, and this is just kind of a little side issue, but I don't care.
[02:08:24.446 --> 02:08:27.107]  I want to give credit where credit's due, but for me it doesn't matter.
[02:08:27.447 --> 02:08:28.967]  It's about spreading the info.
[02:08:28.987 --> 02:08:37.909]  We need to spend more time working on spreading the info instead of getting into, you know, who was the first to discover it.
[02:08:38.169 --> 02:08:39.069]  That doesn't matter.
[02:08:40.329 --> 02:08:42.389]  I mean, I am the father of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:08:42.469 --> 02:08:44.670]  I'm the person that talked about it two months before it happened.
[02:08:44.690 --> 02:08:45.910]  I'm the person that warned everybody.
[02:08:45.950 --> 02:08:48.230]  I'm the guy that made films about government-sponsored terror.
[02:08:48.811 --> 02:08:49.411]  I did that.
[02:08:50.211 --> 02:08:51.091]  Heavy is the crown.
[02:08:51.818 --> 02:08:55.743]  I mean, you know, the watch list, the takedown orders, all this stuff.
[02:08:56.164 --> 02:08:57.285]  I don't frankly like it.
[02:08:58.066 --> 02:09:02.912]  I want to get all of you moving and exposing it so we can save this country, just like Naomi Wolf was just saying.
[02:09:03.829 --> 02:09:04.650]  This is life and death.
[02:09:04.690 --> 02:09:05.430]  That's the point I'm making.
[02:09:05.450 --> 02:09:06.311]  This isn't a game.
[02:09:06.331 --> 02:09:07.571]  This isn't a joke.
[02:09:08.012 --> 02:09:09.693]  This isn't tiddlywinks we're playing.
[02:09:10.073 --> 02:09:24.382]  We need to get focused as a movement, as the American people, because the COINTELPRO operators try to get us all fighting and arguing over who's got all the answers, or who said it first, or who's right or who's wrong, or which supposed group runs it all.
[02:09:24.622 --> 02:09:26.183]  The point is, we know there's a global government.
[02:09:26.223 --> 02:09:27.404]  We know tyrants are running it.
[02:09:27.644 --> 02:09:29.085]  We know they're setting up a police state.
[02:09:29.345 --> 02:09:30.446]  We gotta shut that down.
[02:09:32.165 --> 02:09:35.249]  Now, you can go to InfoWars.com and go to his website.
[02:09:35.289 --> 02:09:41.816]  It's John Taylor Gatto.
[02:09:42.236 --> 02:09:43.197]  John Taylor Gatto.
[02:09:43.258 --> 02:09:44.699]  Gatto's G-A-T-T-O.
[02:09:44.759 --> 02:09:46.301]  JohnTaylorGatto.com.
[02:09:47.162 --> 02:09:48.904]  And he's just an amazing
[02:09:49.907 --> 02:09:57.361]  Individuals made documentary films, written books, done so much more and we're going to have to get him back up again sometime because 48 minutes is not enough time.
[02:09:57.842 --> 02:10:00.367]  And I appreciate him coming on with us today.
[02:10:00.387 --> 02:10:02.391]  Sir, I'm really honored to have you on.
[02:10:03.453 --> 02:10:04.314]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:10:04.434 --> 02:10:10.558]  It's a pleasure to be with you in Austin, which has become one of my favorite towns in the world.
[02:10:10.578 --> 02:10:15.202]  I have a lot of friends there, and I promise not to mention any of their names.
[02:10:15.742 --> 02:10:16.363]  It doesn't matter.
[02:10:16.663 --> 02:10:28.352]  Listen, tell us a little bit about yourself, how you woke up to this, your life, and then just get right into the history, how they took over education, why they did it, their own words, their own documents, the sources.
[02:10:29.136 --> 02:10:34.759]  Sure, well I grew up in Western Pennsylvania during the Second World War.
[02:10:34.819 --> 02:10:50.647]  It was a town not too far from Pittsburgh and it was full of coal miners and steel workers and there was a whole lot of value placed on simple truth and thinking for yourself.
[02:10:50.747 --> 02:10:57.131]  We all went to school but nobody, I mean nobody, considered that school was going to be very important.
[02:10:58.143 --> 02:11:16.257]  You know, as I passed through two Ivy League colleges, I bought the whole program that somehow or other the people who acquire diplomas, and especially from famous schools, are set to rule the world.
[02:11:16.397 --> 02:11:26.304]  So I was an advertising copywriter, and in advertising there's a lot of turnover, so often you're in between jobs.
[02:11:28.132 --> 02:11:36.397]  In between jobs, my roommate had a school teacher's license, and he said, you gotta be crazy to do that.
[02:11:36.417 --> 02:11:46.542]  He did it for one day, threw his license in the drawer, and went off to be a waiter at the Waldorf Astorium, was soon making a couple thousand dollars a week.
[02:11:46.982 --> 02:11:49.263]  This is 30 years ago, 40 years ago.
[02:11:49.364 --> 02:11:55.667]  So, in between ad jobs, I saw that license, and I said, I'll teach for a couple of days.
[02:11:55.807 --> 02:11:57.268]  Anybody can do this.
[02:11:58.012 --> 02:11:59.973]  Called in as my roommate.
[02:11:59.993 --> 02:12:04.536]  He didn't care and I started to substitute teach.
[02:12:05.076 --> 02:12:21.566]  And Alex, I ran into the strangest resistance at different schools, not on the part of students, but on the part of the administration to allow the teaching to be efficient.
[02:12:21.586 --> 02:12:24.908]  Let me just give you one example of that and you'll see.
[02:12:25.569 --> 02:12:33.752]  Like everyone in Texas, and I was in the Army in Texas a long time ago, I speak a few hundred words of Spanish.
[02:12:33.772 --> 02:12:37.353]  So they gave me a Spanish class to substitute in.
[02:12:38.054 --> 02:12:40.315]  I asked the kids if they knew how to tell time.
[02:12:40.375 --> 02:12:41.535]  They all said no.
[02:12:41.595 --> 02:12:43.316]  And I said, hey, it's so easy.
[02:12:44.216 --> 02:12:47.137]  In 15 minutes, you all know how to tell time in Spanish.
[02:12:47.177 --> 02:12:49.518]  That's basically about all I could do.
[02:12:50.238 --> 02:12:54.880]  So I go through telling time, and everybody can tell time at the end of the hour.
[02:12:55.629 --> 02:13:09.752]  By the third time I did this, because the sub has, you know, the principal came in, poured me into the hall, screamed at me that I had destroyed the entire curriculum for the month of June.
[02:13:09.772 --> 02:13:17.274]  She would never be able to explain it to the teacher who was out sick, but I would never be hired again at that school.
[02:13:17.774 --> 02:13:23.675]  I really was bewildered that someone would think that Telling Time in Spanish was the whole
[02:13:25.327 --> 02:13:28.369]  So, this happened in a different way at another school.
[02:13:28.389 --> 02:13:29.410]  I won't go through the details.
[02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:31.851]  And so you started searching to find out the roots of this.
[02:13:31.911 --> 02:13:32.812]  Let's get into the history.
[02:13:33.112 --> 02:13:34.833]  Yeah.
[02:13:34.933 --> 02:13:40.096]  But I knew that this person wasn't an evil person.
[02:13:40.116 --> 02:13:44.458]  She just knew, you know, what side her bread was being buttered on.
[02:13:44.478 --> 02:13:45.699]  It was compartmentalization.
[02:13:46.824 --> 02:13:58.432]  Yeah, so as I taught through the years, I told my wife, I'm going to stay in this business just to see how far I can push these kids who are supposed to be stupid.
[02:13:59.272 --> 02:14:05.156]  And as soon as I found the limits, you know, I'll go back to advertising and make us a fortune.
[02:14:05.917 --> 02:14:10.920]  But after 30 years, I never found how far I could push them.
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:15.423]  The truth is, I went to Cornell and Columbia University and have degrees.
[02:14:16.249 --> 02:14:23.477]  And I began to teach on the level of graduate Ivy League college and these 13-year-old Harlem kids.
[02:14:23.537 --> 02:14:34.308]  I mean, there was a little bit of problem with the idiom, you know, and I'm much older than them, but I found that once they caught on that there was actually going to be something real going on in the class,
[02:14:34.929 --> 02:14:37.169]  They didn't have too much trouble keeping up.
[02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:41.370]  So I really was bewildered at this point now.
[02:14:41.610 --> 02:14:49.872]  Because then I started to get into tremendous trouble with the school district because these 13-year-old Harlem kids were winning.
[02:14:50.412 --> 02:14:57.893]  If I mean, if I tell you every award New York City had to give and they weren't supposed to be winning those awards.
[02:14:58.713 --> 02:15:02.514]  So I came under heavy scrutiny and I resigned on the
[02:15:03.186 --> 02:15:11.490]  Op-Ed page of the Wall Street Journal saying I wasn't willing, I didn't think any improvement was really possible in institutional schooling.
[02:15:11.530 --> 02:15:13.531]  I wasn't willing to hurt kids any longer.
[02:15:13.591 --> 02:15:31.839]  That was 15 years ago, and for the last 15 years, I mean 7 days a week, around the clock, I've been digging up where this institution came from, why it took the shape it took, and how it manages to continue growing larger
[02:15:32.381 --> 02:15:37.222]  And more expensive, in the face of almost universal criticism.
[02:15:37.242 --> 02:15:42.823]  Give us the brief synopsis, analysis, the basic architecture, where it came from, and then get into detail.
[02:15:43.363 --> 02:15:54.886]  Well, obviously, all through human history, some people have wanted, you know, more than their share, and they've wanted to keep other people in their place.
[02:15:54.946 --> 02:15:57.067]  That's human nature.
[02:15:57.147 --> 02:15:58.387]  It's not a conspiracy.
[02:15:58.427 --> 02:15:58.887]  It's a way
[02:15:59.562 --> 02:16:13.013]  A lot of people are, but somewhere at the beginning of the 19th century, and somewhere was a little state in northern Germany called Prussia, which once was world famous.
[02:16:13.033 --> 02:16:24.823]  I mean, Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolutionary War was a Prussian, and Prussians have appeared
[02:16:25.583 --> 02:16:37.666]  To draw the border between Canada and the United States and the Northwest, there's a town around Philadelphia called King of Prussia that really showed the honor in which we held Prussia.
[02:16:37.726 --> 02:16:53.409]  Well, at the beginning of the 19th century, Prussia decided that to have efficient management, it needed to remove the ability of ordinary people to think.
[02:16:54.116 --> 02:16:54.236]  Yes.
[02:17:14.864 --> 02:17:16.265]  And this is all in mainline textbooks.
[02:17:16.445 --> 02:17:17.947]  This is not debatable.
[02:17:18.067 --> 02:17:18.988]  This is all facts.
[02:17:19.128 --> 02:17:20.529]  Stay there.
[02:17:20.549 --> 02:17:22.430]  We're going to go over it with our guest, John Taylor Gatto.
[02:17:22.450 --> 02:17:23.271]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:17:23.291 --> 02:17:24.472]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[02:17:45.126 --> 02:17:46.167]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:17:46.568 --> 02:17:52.053]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:17:52.634 --> 02:17:53.134]  That's right.
[02:17:53.434 --> 02:17:55.737]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:17:56.297 --> 02:18:03.204]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:18:03.763 --> 02:18:11.476]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:18:11.917 --> 02:18:16.724]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:18:17.393 --> 02:18:22.396]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:23.197 --> 02:18:27.319]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:18:27.700 --> 02:18:27.980]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:29.921]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:18:29.981 --> 02:18:30.281]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:30.582 --> 02:18:30.842]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:45.163 --> 02:18:49.666]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:50.006 --> 02:18:54.088]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:54.388 --> 02:18:54.929]  We listened.
[02:18:55.249 --> 02:19:00.231]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:00.492 --> 02:19:00.972]  We listened.
[02:19:01.352 --> 02:19:04.394]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:04.834 --> 02:19:05.354]  We listened.
[02:19:05.815 --> 02:19:09.897]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:19:10.277 --> 02:19:10.757]  We listened.
[02:19:11.098 --> 02:19:16.340]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:19:16.761 --> 02:19:17.021]  Again,
[02:19:17.581 --> 02:19:18.122]  We listened.
[02:19:18.462 --> 02:19:20.063]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:19:20.244 --> 02:19:25.848]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:19:26.269 --> 02:19:28.891]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water purifier.
[02:19:29.091 --> 02:19:29.291]  Only $279.
[02:19:29.331 --> 02:19:29.832]  Call New Millennium.
[02:19:29.852 --> 02:19:29.952]  888-803-4438.
[02:19:29.992 --> 02:19:30.232]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:19:30.292 --> 02:19:31.633]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:19:31.653 --> 02:19:32.394]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:43.360 --> 02:19:45.722]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:46.222 --> 02:19:53.008]  Did you know that an FBI agent assigned to the White House when Bill Clinton took office wrote a book entitled Unlimited Access?
[02:19:53.729 --> 02:20:01.115]  He told of Clinton's staff coming into the White House its first day with red buttons on their shirt with a picture of the first communist dictator, V.I.
[02:20:01.175 --> 02:20:01.796]  Lenin, on them.
[02:20:02.676 --> 02:20:07.358]  Is it any wonder the United States government moved further to the left during the Clinton administration?
[02:20:07.978 --> 02:20:11.960]  Even Hillary tried to pass a socialistic program for health care.
[02:20:12.580 --> 02:20:20.083]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.

[02:20:42.313 --> 02:20:42.773]  Hi, Ken.
[02:20:42.833 --> 02:20:43.594]  It's Judy again.
[02:20:43.614 --> 02:20:48.156]  I just wanted to call you back and let you know how thankful Mike and I are for your working with us.
[02:20:48.296 --> 02:20:51.438]  You know the Sun Oven we ordered from you on KenSolar.com?
[02:20:51.678 --> 02:20:53.539]  It cooks all of our food and then some.
[02:20:53.819 --> 02:20:55.900]  Plus, we just sold the old gas barbecue.
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:21:02.183]  Also, the solar-powered generator reduced our electric bill just like you said it would, and it's powering my whole studio right now.
[02:21:02.383 --> 02:21:07.686]  We don't have to worry about our food going bad or surviving the outages anymore, either of which is huge.
[02:21:07.946 --> 02:21:10.807]  Well, Ken, I'll cut this one short for now, and thanks again.
[02:21:10.927 --> 02:21:11.848]  Go KenSolar!
[02:21:13.149 --> 02:21:14.670]  Get the best of both worlds.

[02:21:49.280 --> 02:21:58.254]  JohnTaylorGatto.com documentary filmmaker, author, educator, ad man
[02:22:00.800 --> 02:22:01.861]  John, continuing.
[02:22:02.921 --> 02:22:04.282]  Now again, this is mainline history.
[02:22:04.302 --> 02:22:05.603]  We study education with the public.
[02:22:05.623 --> 02:22:07.184]  Again, it hasn't been educated, so they don't know.
[02:22:07.204 --> 02:22:10.386]  They haven't been taught the joy of learning, how exciting it is by design.
[02:22:10.446 --> 02:22:18.471]  It's taught to be by rote, to regurgitate the kindergarten system, to actually make soldiers that would march into bayonet lines.
[02:22:18.871 --> 02:22:23.735]  And that was expanded out to industry, so they took that military-style training and brought it into the industry.
[02:22:24.055 --> 02:22:29.018]  And now they're getting it finally honed, as you know, down to specific career-based
[02:22:29.478 --> 02:22:34.219]  Okay, we're in Prussia now, and the year is 1819, and for the first time in human history, a successful universal system of forced schooling is in place.
[02:22:34.239 --> 02:22:37.160]  Yeah, the teachers' college you'll find a lot of earlier
[02:22:56.306 --> 02:22:59.006]  Attempts, including in New England, to do this.
[02:22:59.387 --> 02:23:04.167]  Not one of them ever worked, because there was too much common sense around.
[02:23:04.547 --> 02:23:07.928]  But Prussia wasn't reluctant to use bayonets.
[02:23:08.008 --> 02:23:13.089]  So for the first time in human history, we have this thing up and running by 1819.
[02:23:14.069 --> 02:23:17.610]  Ten years later, it's running like clockwork.
[02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:25.511]  Prussia, which has no natural resources, a small population, is the fourth richest country on Earth.
[02:23:26.227 --> 02:23:30.951]  And it's population marches into battle without argument.
[02:23:31.511 --> 02:23:41.500]  So everybody who was involved in trying to get the same system in the United States made the trip to Prussia
[02:23:42.373 --> 02:23:43.994]  And studied the system.
[02:23:44.094 --> 02:23:46.296]  And it's only one county today of Germany.
[02:23:46.336 --> 02:23:47.417]  It's a very small area.
[02:23:47.717 --> 02:23:48.738]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:23:48.818 --> 02:23:57.024]  It's right up against the North Sea, and it still doesn't have any money, but it produced the three largest wars so far in human history.
[02:23:57.664 --> 02:24:06.110]  So it's pretty effective when people have their independent mind removed, when they can't critically think.
[02:24:06.550 --> 02:24:11.834]  They're much more efficient to be ordered around and used as, here's a term I know you heard,
[02:24:12.253 --> 02:24:14.574]  Here in Austin, human resources.
[02:24:15.194 --> 02:24:22.637]  Well, people aren't human resources until you remove their free will and their ideas.
[02:24:22.717 --> 02:24:24.217]  And the joke's right out in the open.
[02:24:24.237 --> 02:24:25.578]  They're calling us resources.
[02:24:25.798 --> 02:24:28.239]  Oh yeah, they have a department in government.
[02:24:28.679 --> 02:24:30.980]  Well, Prussia is now studied.
[02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:45.001]  By every major country on earth, as far away as Japan, as I said, everyone involved in schooling in the United States comes back from Prussia.
[02:24:45.021 --> 02:24:50.505]  For folks that don't know, that's the kindergarten system, and that's our whole form of education.
[02:24:50.545 --> 02:24:51.366]  Oh yes, yes.
[02:24:51.466 --> 02:24:59.052]  Well, at first it wasn't, and then they decided that they weren't getting the minds early enough.
[02:24:59.668 --> 02:25:06.876]  And so they built the kindergarten system, which means a garden where you grow children like vegetables.
[02:25:07.056 --> 02:25:10.059]  I'm amazed that that's eluded people.
[02:25:10.079 --> 02:25:12.241]  And it's more effective.
[02:25:12.281 --> 02:25:14.504]  And now in places like New York City,
[02:25:15.021 --> 02:25:18.744]  Even kindergarten is considered not early enough.
[02:25:18.884 --> 02:25:21.947]  Too much independence survives.
[02:25:22.347 --> 02:25:27.932]  They're getting kids at age three now into pre-kindergarten here.
[02:25:27.952 --> 02:25:31.194]  And now they're saying, oh, parents, we know you're working hard.
[02:25:31.254 --> 02:25:34.237]  We have after-school programs till eight at night, so they have them all the time.
[02:25:34.577 --> 02:25:45.943]  The CIA of course funded the modern feminist movement, they admit it, it's now declassified, so the mother couldn't be there even in the afternoon to take care of them, so you get double taxpayers, so the parents are completely removed.
[02:25:46.144 --> 02:25:50.866]  Then the leadership model males, these are federal documents that speak up, you drug them.
[02:25:51.967 --> 02:25:57.650]  The family is, without thinking about it, it's the biggest obstacle in the path
[02:25:58.342 --> 02:25:58.682]  I think so.
[02:26:15.307 --> 02:26:18.289]  Predict which way love is going to take you.
[02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:28.938]  The family itself has to be disintegrated, and the payoff, the bribe for extending schooling is, well look, we'll put your kids in the hands of
[02:26:29.985 --> 02:26:30.566]  I think so.
[02:26:51.914 --> 02:26:57.602]  This was written into legislation that the state owned the children.
[02:26:57.622 --> 02:27:00.526]  That's not my interpretation.
[02:27:00.907 --> 02:27:02.289]  Those are the laws.
[02:27:04.048 --> 02:27:16.917]  Through the 19th century, the United States attempts were made to write that into legislation, and there are records, Alex, quite a few, of courts reaching that determination.
[02:27:16.937 --> 02:27:17.837]  Let's talk about that.
[02:27:18.058 --> 02:27:22.541]  Let's give some specifics in Prussia and here in the U.S., how it ties into eugenics.
[02:27:22.561 --> 02:27:28.745]  Some of the first social orders were set up in England, and then in Germany to carry out these operations, racial hygiene.
[02:27:28.985 --> 02:27:30.526]  Hitler, of course, sitting on the children.
[02:27:30.686 --> 02:27:31.367]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.785 --> 02:27:36.794]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:37.716 --> 02:27:40.404]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:43.542 --> 02:27:46.883]  Attention, this is an urgent GCN Financial Bulletin.
[02:27:47.183 --> 02:27:52.185]  Have you ever wanted to make a lot of extra cash in a way that requires very little money to get started?
[02:27:52.585 --> 02:27:57.746]  If so, and you have a high-speed internet connection, this may well be the most important message you will ever hear.
[02:27:57.966 --> 02:27:58.547]  Here's why.
[02:27:58.767 --> 02:28:06.749]  You can now get a free DVD that reveals how to make more money than any sane person can possibly spend, and do it while working part-time at home.
[02:28:06.929 --> 02:28:07.310]  I think so.
[02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:26.150]  We're good.
[02:28:43.575 --> 02:28:45.436]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:28:45.576 --> 02:28:50.759]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:28:50.919 --> 02:28:52.259]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:28:52.539 --> 02:29:00.703]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:29:00.923 --> 02:29:06.646]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:29:06.826 --> 02:29:08.608]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:29:08.668 --> 02:29:10.830]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:29:10.850 --> 02:29:15.215]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:29:15.395 --> 02:29:17.538]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:29:17.618 --> 02:29:25.466]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:29:25.486 --> 02:29:25.766]  We're good.
[02:29:43.030 --> 02:29:43.670]  It's a fact.
[02:29:43.890 --> 02:29:51.373]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:29:51.493 --> 02:30:00.356]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:30:00.636 --> 02:30:11.160]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:17.502]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:30:17.702 --> 02:30:22.744]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:30:22.904 --> 02:30:27.406]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[02:30:27.566 --> 02:30:29.367]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[02:30:29.407 --> 02:30:29.587]  That's 877-943-8600.
[02:30:29.607 --> 02:30:29.967]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[02:30:30.007 --> 02:30:31.587]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[02:30:39.530 --> 02:31:07.505]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' on But that train keeps a-rollin'
[02:31:08.563 --> 02:31:10.982]  Alone down the San Antone.
[02:31:18.794 --> 02:31:25.638]  NoSickHolidays.com, NoSickHolidays.com, that's their website for the holidays, for the immune surge.
[02:31:26.659 --> 02:31:36.826]  It is a product filled with elderberry and all these other berries that have been well documented in scientific studies to be powerful antivirals and to boost the overall immune system.
[02:31:36.846 --> 02:31:40.829]  And during the holiday season there's all the stress, the shopping, the banking, the meal prep,
[02:31:41.369 --> 02:31:48.733]  And everybody's indoors, and everybody, I don't have to tell you that people get the flu, they get sick, all this stuff spreads during the holiday season.
[02:31:49.613 --> 02:31:55.876]  And it's good, plus it's full of antioxidants, to go ahead and put your family on Immune Surge, especially your children.
[02:31:56.277 --> 02:32:00.359]  NoSickHolidays.com, NoSickHolidays.com, or give them a call at 866-402-6680.
[02:32:00.379 --> 02:32:01.799]  Immune Surge, ladies and gentlemen, at 866.
[02:32:07.796 --> 02:32:08.796]  And of course, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:32:34.466 --> 02:32:35.367]  Tis the season!
[02:32:35.547 --> 02:32:36.768]  Why battle the crowds?
[02:32:36.869 --> 02:32:38.310]  Why go to the horrible malls?
[02:32:38.450 --> 02:32:40.192]  Why stomp around to give gifts?
[02:32:41.213 --> 02:32:44.816]  We've told all our family, don't give us presents this holiday season, this Christmas.
[02:32:44.897 --> 02:32:47.059]  We don't believe in going into debt and doing all this stuff.
[02:32:47.579 --> 02:32:48.520]  But still, people are going to do it.
[02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:49.561]  We're still giving some gifts.
[02:32:49.601 --> 02:32:50.722]  We always say we're not, and we do.
[02:32:50.742 --> 02:32:53.966]  And of course, the children really want the gifts, and it's always fun.
[02:32:55.007 --> 02:32:57.229]  But, documentary films!
[02:32:57.967 --> 02:32:59.288]  I've made 17 of them.
[02:32:59.829 --> 02:33:02.731]  There's two versions of Terror Storm, so really 16 I have, you could say.
[02:33:03.572 --> 02:33:16.783]  But, End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement, the New World Order Master Plan to set up a police state, dumb the population down, and carry out orderly hyper-eugenics and the one-child policies of sterilizations, exterminations.
[02:33:16.863 --> 02:33:19.245]  It's all documented in End Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[02:33:19.525 --> 02:33:23.949]  It also documents who the globalists are, the North American Union, the EU, their own statements.
[02:33:24.629 --> 02:33:26.290]  It's really two or three films in one.
[02:33:26.310 --> 02:33:32.412]  I was talking to one of my Hollywood producer friends last night, Tommy Pallotta, who made Scanner Darkly, and a lot of other big films.
[02:33:32.833 --> 02:33:34.473]  And he was saying, yeah, it's your best work yet.
[02:33:34.493 --> 02:33:36.094]  But he goes, Alex, it's two films again.
[02:33:36.134 --> 02:33:37.254]  It's two hours, 20 minutes.
[02:33:37.615 --> 02:33:38.495]  It really is two films.
[02:33:39.168 --> 02:33:39.808]  Yes, we are.
[02:34:02.458 --> 02:34:03.618]  We're good to go.
[02:34:32.020 --> 02:34:33.541]  We ship it all out UPS.
[02:34:33.661 --> 02:34:35.102]  Unless you ask, we'll do postal.
[02:34:35.602 --> 02:34:39.645]  But all orders up until the 16th are guaranteed to get to you before Christmas.
[02:34:40.565 --> 02:34:43.407]  It takes, what, a maximum of four days for UPS inside the U.S.
[02:34:43.447 --> 02:34:44.428]  Most places two or three.
[02:34:45.308 --> 02:34:48.750]  The mail, it should get to you if you get it in by the 16th.
[02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:51.152]  But mail's weird, even if it's a priority.
[02:34:51.972 --> 02:34:55.935]  But in nine days it should get to you in time, probably before Christmas.
[02:34:56.255 --> 02:34:59.077]  But if you order UPS by the 16th, you've still got plenty of time.
[02:34:59.437 --> 02:35:06.421]  Either way right now, by mail, we'll get your letter in time at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:35:07.722 --> 02:35:11.984]  Or again, InfoWars.com to order via the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[02:35:12.345 --> 02:35:15.807]  Or watch Endgame right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:35:15.947 --> 02:35:19.789]  And Endgame 1.5, an hour and 10 minutes, the first part uploaded.
[02:35:20.609 --> 02:35:38.244]  And later this evening, you will be able to see the second installment, another 40 minutes, mainly in Istanbul, dealing with the whole European Union and EU, North American Union being merged with the EU, and behind-the-scenes stuff with Jim Tucker in Istanbul for this year's Goldbergs.
[02:35:38.324 --> 02:35:44.689]  Endgame 1.5, the first two parts up there, the third part, or the second installment for the second day going up today.
[02:35:45.389 --> 02:35:47.371]  Going back to our guest,
[02:35:48.976 --> 02:35:51.557]  Who I really appreciate coming on, John Taylor Gatto.
[02:35:51.697 --> 02:35:52.757]  You've got the floor, sir.
[02:35:52.777 --> 02:35:57.038]  Anytime you want to plug your film, your book, any of it, The Secret History of Education.
[02:35:57.098 --> 02:35:59.819]  It's not secret if you go look, everything you're saying is documented.
[02:36:00.880 --> 02:36:01.600]  You've got the floor.
[02:36:01.660 --> 02:36:11.503]  Go through how it was set up, what happened, what we face today and hopefully solutions to educate the public to get out of it, to extricate ourselves out of it.
[02:36:12.743 --> 02:36:15.204]  Let me start by telling your audience that
[02:36:15.777 --> 02:36:23.815]  If you go to my website, my big book, Underground History of American Education, which you can buy in bookstores for $35 is up on my website.
[02:36:26.229 --> 02:36:27.349]  Absolutely free.
[02:36:27.389 --> 02:36:31.670]  It took 10 years around the clock to write.
[02:36:31.850 --> 02:36:33.051]  It's 330,000 words.
[02:36:33.191 --> 02:36:39.332]  I forgot to mention that, again, a true sign, just like I put my films out for free too, you put your book out for free.
[02:36:39.372 --> 02:36:40.112]  God bless you.
[02:36:40.513 --> 02:36:50.275]  So take a deep breath, but you'll find all of this information I'm giving you now documented, and many, many times more.
[02:36:51.168 --> 02:37:15.007]  So what we are is back at the beginning of the 19th century, and I'll run through this real quick, and this little military state of Prussia, for the first time in human history, forces all the young of its ordinary population to go to school, and the country almost immediately becomes
[02:37:15.859 --> 02:37:26.028]  The companies become more prosperous, the army becomes more successful because the leaders, the managers, think for everybody.
[02:37:26.469 --> 02:37:29.972]  So Prussia is now studied all over the world.
[02:37:30.032 --> 02:37:32.314]  They send delegations from Japan.
[02:37:32.952 --> 02:37:40.356]  Delegations from Russia and many, many delegations from the United States go to Prussia.
[02:37:40.416 --> 02:37:48.140]  And by the way, it was so successful that the Gestapo was founded out of the Prussian State Police and the SS was founded out of them.
[02:37:48.481 --> 02:37:49.741]  Absolutely!
[02:37:50.001 --> 02:37:55.945]  See, if you don't have employees who argue with you or say, no, I won't do that,
[02:37:56.678 --> 02:37:58.579]  You're bound to be more efficient.
[02:37:58.879 --> 02:38:09.807]  Now, it is a kind of short-term efficiency, but... Because very soon everything degenerates and falls apart, and then you have no brains to pull from in the next generation.
[02:38:09.987 --> 02:38:12.008]  Exactly, and that's what's happening to us.
[02:38:12.128 --> 02:38:15.350]  My dad's a pretty high-level executive in healthcare.
[02:38:15.370 --> 02:38:20.452]  I'd say he's one of the top thousand brains in healthcare in the country.
[02:38:20.952 --> 02:38:23.754]  He gets sent to these $5,000 to $10,000 seminars.
[02:38:24.854 --> 02:38:27.015]  One day he called me from the Four Seasons here in Austin.
[02:38:28.496 --> 02:38:34.842]  I forget the guy's name, he's a real famous guy, and he said, the New World Order has destroyed everyone's brains with the Prussian model.
[02:38:34.882 --> 02:38:37.645]  My dad called me from out in the hall going, it's incredible, it's like six.
[02:38:37.965 --> 02:38:52.118]  And he said, he said, the guy says that our models destroyed everyone, so now we don't have anyone to pull from except the homeschoolers, but we've got to keep it secret for management, because we've got to keep this other system in place, but they admitted that it's, they've overdone it.
[02:38:52.198 --> 02:38:52.579]  But go ahead.
[02:38:52.979 --> 02:38:58.624]  Well, let me give your listeners a piece of mathematical proof of what you just said.
[02:38:59.645 --> 02:39:10.534]  In 1950, the United States had 90% of all the patents for invention issued in the planet Earth.
[02:39:10.994 --> 02:39:15.258]  Now we're down in the low 30s and dropping fast.
[02:39:16.013 --> 02:39:26.544]  Because once you destroy this imagination, which was specifically recommended by some names I'm going to give you so you can verify this independently, but
[02:39:27.236 --> 02:39:40.545]  But all of the big thinkers who led to the schooling we know said, first you have to destroy the imagination of ordinary people, or they'll think up ways to escape this, or get around this.
[02:39:40.945 --> 02:39:50.612]  But once the imagination was gone, all that stream of invention... It's the engine of innovation, of creativity, and of rebellion.
[02:39:50.872 --> 02:39:51.173]  Yes!
[02:39:51.933 --> 02:39:54.555]  Yes, I mean, and it was certainly a source of
[02:39:55.265 --> 02:39:56.446]  Of incredible wealth.
[02:39:57.006 --> 02:40:01.829]  I'm invited to speak about half a dozen times so far by the Chinese government.
[02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:04.992]  And I've been in all different parts of China.
[02:40:05.292 --> 02:40:18.721]  And the funny thing is, is the three American businesses which clearly dominate China, that's really amusing in a way, are all built around imagination.
[02:40:19.822 --> 02:40:37.829]  I'll tell you, every Chinese I saw was playing American computer games while they were sitting in a McDonald's eating, I don't mean this too critically, but eating pieces of meat that I'll tell you in human history nobody would eat except slaves.
[02:40:38.269 --> 02:40:46.292]  But anyway, all the movies, all the traveling acts at the big hotels, they're all American because the imagination is
[02:40:47.205 --> 02:40:47.665]  Go ahead.
[02:41:04.722 --> 02:41:05.543]  Regularly.
[02:41:05.803 --> 02:41:06.624]  Here's an example.
[02:41:06.744 --> 02:41:11.208]  Until about 1915, going back to 1800, the U.S.
[02:41:11.268 --> 02:41:15.472]  had over half the patents, 4% of the population had half the world's wealth.
[02:41:15.872 --> 02:41:18.255]  Because of feudalism, there was no imagination.
[02:41:18.295 --> 02:41:22.679]  They just institutionalized this system and that's why we dominated the world.
[02:41:22.959 --> 02:41:29.565]  Now the globalists have seized us and used us as an engine to dominate, but now they've depleted and destroyed their brain trust.
[02:41:29.945 --> 02:41:30.266]  Yes.
[02:41:30.826 --> 02:41:33.527]  Yes, well let me get back though to Prussia.
[02:41:33.547 --> 02:41:47.312]  So Prussia is studied all over the world by ambitious nations including the United States and the lessons how to do this to your population are brought back
[02:41:47.836 --> 02:42:03.887]  The trouble in the United States was, as Abraham Lincoln said in 1859 to the Wisconsin Agricultural Association, virtually everyone in the United States, 75% of the population, had an independent livelihood.
[02:42:04.207 --> 02:42:09.271]  They were small farmers, they were entrepreneurs, they were dressmakers, they were traveling entertainers.
[02:42:10.027 --> 02:42:18.290]  And they didn't buckle under because they weren't tied to some bureaucratic ladder of jobs.
[02:42:18.970 --> 02:42:39.377]  So it took a long time, and what it took was several crushing inflations, financial panics, and several big wars to pull this off under the cover of these wars and financial panics.
[02:42:40.038 --> 02:42:52.907]  Institutional schooling was set up to deliver the same kind of mindless or semi-mindless citizenry that Prussia had enjoyed.
[02:42:53.508 --> 02:42:57.330]  And now we see the average American, one-fifth, can't find the U.S.
[02:42:57.390 --> 02:42:58.571]  on a map.
[02:42:58.651 --> 02:43:02.034]  Seventy-plus percent of high school graduates don't even know what a continent is.
[02:43:02.134 --> 02:43:03.755]  Or where the Pacific Ocean is.
[02:43:03.795 --> 02:43:04.496]  Yeah, right.
[02:43:05.496 --> 02:43:08.059]  It's way beyond what the newspapers cover.
[02:43:08.099 --> 02:43:09.401]  That's what Orwell talked about, though.
[02:43:09.421 --> 02:43:12.865]  He had discovered this, how they were destroying language, reducing it by design.
[02:43:13.305 --> 02:43:21.154]  It's like people listening to us right now either have escaped this or a new listener who's been under this control can't even understand us right now.
[02:43:21.554 --> 02:43:24.558]  Well, I must add to your
[02:43:25.126 --> 02:43:31.968]  Orwell illusion, that Orwell was in the outer fringes of this thing when it was happening.
[02:43:32.008 --> 02:43:37.329]  So he didn't discover it, he actually listened to the people planning this.
[02:43:37.389 --> 02:43:45.871]  And when he wrote 1984, which all the American papers said had to be about the Soviet Union, he was talking about London and England.
[02:43:45.891 --> 02:43:47.511]  Oh yeah, he said that, yeah.
[02:43:47.571 --> 02:43:50.392]  Yeah, but that's conveniently...
[02:43:52.721 --> 02:44:06.727]  He wrote letters where he said that, because he'd been a secret policeman in India, then he'd fought against the fascists in Spain, then he'd been a propagandist for BBC during the war, and he finally figured out they were controlling it all.
[02:44:07.127 --> 02:44:12.630]  Well, it was his BBC contacts who were rather proud of what they were doing.
[02:44:13.266 --> 02:44:28.975]  Really, the whole idea, I mean we call part of that group now the Fabian Socialists, but the idea was that biologically, you and I and about 95% of the population are permanently inferior
[02:44:30.035 --> 02:44:36.056]  I want to source that for you so that anyone who says this is wild talk can check it for themselves.
[02:44:36.436 --> 02:44:42.998]  It was Charles Darwin who said that in 1871 in the book called Descent of Man.
[02:44:43.378 --> 02:44:47.739]  He said only a few of the human race are evolving.
[02:44:47.919 --> 02:44:54.920]  Everybody else is a dead end and if you can't... And then that expanded into his protégé, Sir Francis Galton, the father of eugenics.
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:58.921]  Oh well, Galton was more than his protégé, it was his first cousin!
[02:44:59.790 --> 02:45:02.631]  It was his first cousin who it was called.
[02:45:02.651 --> 02:45:07.514]  Now I want to be clear, you independently have done all the same research I've done, discovered the same thing.
[02:45:07.914 --> 02:45:10.935]  So has Alan Watts, so have many others.
[02:45:11.275 --> 02:45:13.636]  The point is, people keep thinking we're getting this from each other.
[02:45:13.716 --> 02:45:15.857]  I've never heard you until a few years ago and heard you once.
[02:45:15.877 --> 02:45:18.999]  I mean, the point is, is that we're all discovering the same thing.
[02:45:19.239 --> 02:45:22.540]  And listeners, if you go research this, you're going to find the same thing.
[02:45:23.901 --> 02:45:26.342]  With the internet, it's fairly easy to read.
[02:45:26.882 --> 02:45:29.784]  You don't have to go to an interpreter of this data.
[02:45:30.145 --> 02:45:31.966]  You can go directly to the data.
[02:45:31.986 --> 02:45:32.446]  To them?
[02:45:32.807 --> 02:45:37.130]  You can pick at random any book that Galton ever wrote.
[02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:39.031]  That's Darwin's first cousin.
[02:45:39.431 --> 02:45:43.334]  And the Herald stands up on your head and he's advising.
[02:45:44.155 --> 02:45:45.716]  I don't think many people know this.
[02:45:45.756 --> 02:45:48.077]  And then his protégé, of course, was H.G.
[02:45:48.097 --> 02:45:51.520]  Wells, whose protégé was then Julian Huxley.
[02:45:51.540 --> 02:45:52.140]  But go ahead.
[02:45:55.842 --> 02:46:00.325]  The Darwin family wasn't just a wealthy family.
[02:46:00.345 --> 02:46:04.828]  They were among the supreme fortunes on planet Earth.
[02:46:04.909 --> 02:46:10.593]  So rather than thinking of Charles Darwin as a scholar speaking to other scholars,
[02:46:11.147 --> 02:46:37.812]  You're talking about a man who was in the inner circle around the British throne, who had fantastic wealth, Galton also, and spoke to, you know, dukes and earls and heads of industry, so that... And plus, their idea of the elite being supermen and us being dogs, that was already the elite's ideas for thousands of years, so they tailored a science to fit into that elitist approach.
[02:46:39.232 --> 02:46:41.273]  The idea certainly has been around.
[02:46:41.313 --> 02:46:44.393]  You can find it clearly in Plato's... But it was scientifically codified, yes.
[02:46:44.853 --> 02:46:47.754]  Yeah, so it starts... I'll say it starts.
[02:46:48.274 --> 02:46:55.756]  It starts in easily accessible documents with Plato's Republic and his Utopia of the Law.
[02:46:56.176 --> 02:46:56.956]  2,400 years, yes.
[02:46:57.216 --> 02:47:01.557]  And he'll say, people are frozen into these categories.
[02:47:01.677 --> 02:47:06.358]  The whole idea that they can get out of these categories is just nuts.
[02:47:06.978 --> 02:47:15.503]  So, but from Plato it goes to a very, very important theological work of the 15th century.
[02:47:15.523 --> 02:47:28.211]  It goes to John Calvin, and Calvin says there's so many of these inferior people damned by God before they're born, that's predestination, that we can't lock them up or police them.
[02:47:28.251 --> 02:47:33.634]  We're going to have to teach them how to police themselves, and we'll do that
[02:47:34.034 --> 02:47:36.455]  by establishing universal schooling.
[02:47:36.495 --> 02:47:54.140]  So after Calvin says what Plato said philosophically, Calvin said theologically, just a short time later, about a hundred and fifty years later, the big gun in this, and I'm going to give your readers a book.
[02:47:55.741 --> 02:47:58.882]  I'm talking about a Dutch philosopher named
[02:47:59.654 --> 02:48:09.738]  Spinoza, S-P-I-N-O-Z-A, who's carried in American colleges as one of the most liberal philosophers who ever lived.
[02:48:10.118 --> 02:48:16.780]  What you have to read is the same book that Jefferson and the early American founders read.
[02:48:17.387 --> 02:48:22.451]  It has a Latin name, but give me a chance to get it out, because you can get it in the library.
[02:48:22.531 --> 02:48:31.297]  It's called Tractate, Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, and in that, after, I guess you've got a break coming up.
[02:48:31.337 --> 02:48:37.021]  Final segment, and listen, we're going to have to get you up for two hours, maybe tomorrow, the next day, sir.
[02:48:37.061 --> 02:48:38.802]  This is, again, people need to hear this.
[02:48:39.183 --> 02:48:40.143]  Final segment coming up.
[02:48:40.183 --> 02:48:42.805]  I want you to do a convinced, into the future view.
[02:48:43.606 --> 02:48:44.927]  It is a big idea.
[02:48:46.073 --> 02:48:47.114]  A New World Order!
[02:48:47.834 --> 02:48:51.877]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[02:48:51.977 --> 02:48:54.919]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:48:55.059 --> 02:48:57.821]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[02:48:58.341 --> 02:49:00.803]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:49:01.524 --> 02:49:08.869]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:49:11.866 --> 02:49:16.870]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:49:17.330 --> 02:49:20.833]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:49:21.193 --> 02:49:23.695]  Bill Burgess is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:49:23.755 --> 02:49:24.716]  Most people have no idea.
[02:49:24.736 --> 02:49:25.636]  They're not after money.
[02:49:25.656 --> 02:49:26.777]  They have all the money they need.
[02:49:26.997 --> 02:49:27.718]  They're after power.
[02:49:27.978 --> 02:49:28.799]  That's what they're after.

[02:50:42.426 --> 02:50:45.928]  This is George Whitehorse Berry with the Genesis Communications Network.
[02:50:46.328 --> 02:50:48.890]  Most scientific advances are merely incremental.
[02:50:49.030 --> 02:50:59.576]  However, once in a while there comes an invention which is so revolutionary, such a quantum leap forward, that it is the product of what scientists call non-linear thinking.
[02:50:59.916 --> 02:51:02.678]  Such an invention is dragon skin body armor.
[02:51:02.938 --> 02:51:12.583]  In a Discovery Channel program, Dragonskin was so superior to older types of body armor that it survived rounds which shredded the body armor now issued to our troops.
[02:51:13.103 --> 02:51:18.726]  Why then have the Bush Regime's military bureaucrats refused to adopt Dragonskin for our troops?
[02:51:19.146 --> 02:51:21.767]  Be sure to tune in to Crash Are You Ready?
[02:51:22.187 --> 02:51:29.251]  Friday, November 30th for a very special interview with Marie Neal, the genius inventor of Dragonskin body armor.
[02:51:29.691 --> 02:51:35.879]  Visit our website at www.hearitonline.com for links to the Dragon Skin Body Armor website.
[02:51:35.979 --> 02:51:37.861]  That's www.hearitonline.com.
[02:51:54.293 --> 02:51:57.434]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:51:57.974 --> 02:52:00.195]  Run on for a long time.
[02:52:00.295 --> 02:52:03.016]  Run on for a long time.
[02:52:03.737 --> 02:52:06.198]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:52:06.718 --> 02:52:09.099]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[02:52:16.809 --> 02:52:18.330]  Everybody knows.
[02:52:18.370 --> 02:52:19.450]  You hear it all the time.
[02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:21.491]  Yeah, they dumb us down on purpose.
[02:52:21.931 --> 02:52:23.411]  And teachers go, don't blame us.
[02:52:23.832 --> 02:52:24.612]  We're not blaming you.
[02:52:24.652 --> 02:52:26.132]  You're kept on a very short leash.
[02:52:26.913 --> 02:52:32.515]  The textbooks are, and I have the federal documents on this, I know our guest does, designed to not teach them.
[02:52:32.555 --> 02:52:33.315]  Designed
[02:52:34.131 --> 02:52:40.115]  So that only the most intelligent will make it through, and it's even meant to stunt them.
[02:52:40.175 --> 02:52:42.117]  See, they claim eugenics is positive and negative.
[02:52:42.637 --> 02:52:45.999]  Breeding elites to be more elite, and culling the dummies.
[02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:51.343]  But in truth, when you actually read the eugenicists, they go, no, our plan is to dumb down the intelligent.
[02:52:51.663 --> 02:53:00.449]  Our plan is to block any middle class that gives rise, that could ever raise a challenge to our hegemon.
[02:53:01.016 --> 02:53:04.399]  Go to his website, get the free book.
[02:53:04.999 --> 02:53:10.063]  He spent decades or 15 years writing this and here it is for you for free.
[02:53:10.103 --> 02:53:10.864]  Buy it, buy it.
[02:53:10.924 --> 02:53:11.604]  Give it as a gift.
[02:53:12.305 --> 02:53:14.226]  The guy isn't doing this for money but he deserves it.
[02:53:14.666 --> 02:53:15.207]  Buy the book.
[02:53:16.005 --> 02:53:24.412]  But send out a mass email about how you can read it, and you tell people, if you care about your children, you'll learn how you were dumbed down, and our parents were dumbed down, and their parents were dumbed down.
[02:53:24.652 --> 02:53:32.098]  We only got about four minutes left, sir, and the transmission's over, but I'm gonna have a producer call you right now at the end of the show and set you up for two hours tomorrow or the next day.
[02:53:32.138 --> 02:53:33.519]  I'm very impressed with your research.
[02:53:34.420 --> 02:53:36.702]  JohnTaylorGatto.com is the website.
[02:53:37.022 --> 02:53:38.964]  John, kind of give us a
[02:53:39.975 --> 02:53:48.902]  Preview of what's coming up, kind of a condensed view in three minutes of where it's going, where it went in the future up until present, and then we'll get into that next time you're on with us.
[02:53:54.231 --> 02:53:56.454]  If I say great minds, you know what I mean.
[02:53:56.514 --> 02:54:04.523]  Through human history, said from different perspectives that most people were trash or garbage or even dangerous.
[02:54:04.603 --> 02:54:11.632]  What happened was that the American economy, which once had been an economy of independent livelihood,
[02:54:12.153 --> 02:54:12.453]  We're good.
[02:54:32.270 --> 02:54:50.874]  Generally, what the rest of them did, because they all worked together, through their foundations, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie imported the Prussian system into the United States, bribed in a gentlemanly fashion, bribed the right people to give it its stride.
[02:54:50.894 --> 02:54:57.655]  There were a few setbacks, but it always moved forward, and generation by generation,
[02:54:58.484 --> 02:55:02.585]  The population became what it was supposed to be.
[02:55:03.085 --> 02:55:17.669]  We crammed, without religious imagination or cause, without independence or an inner life, looking for, if not a handout, looking to be patted on the head and said, good job.
[02:55:17.689 --> 02:55:27.652]  They had to convert the independent American population into one that would fit into a corporate ladder.
[02:55:28.671 --> 02:55:30.259]  At that point... We're out of time.
[02:55:30.279 --> 02:55:31.545]  We're out of time, sir.
[02:55:31.565 --> 02:55:32.711]  Can you come back on tomorrow?
[02:55:33.895 --> 02:55:36.297]  I don't think tomorrow I can.
[02:55:36.357 --> 02:55:38.199]  I would like to, but I have to.
[02:55:38.279 --> 02:55:42.763]  I have a farm about 200 miles from here, and I have to get up there.
[02:55:42.783 --> 02:55:44.344]  I'll tell you what, we'll set you up for next week.
