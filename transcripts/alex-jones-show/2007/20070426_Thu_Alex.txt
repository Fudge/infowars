[00:00:09.816 --> 00:00:13.539]  888-8-HEART-6.
[00:00:13.919 --> 00:00:17.361]  You know your special car needs, deserves, and craves a new engine.
[00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:23.646]  Heartland Engine Builders, from mile to wild, from pace to race, we make dreams affordable.
[00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:31.989]  This is the GCN Radio Network, home to hard-hitting talk radio.
[00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:39.494]  Big Brother.
[00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:41.175]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.017]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:44.498]  You want answers?
[00:00:45.258 --> 00:00:46.179]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.562]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:51.003 --> 00:00:55.066]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.603]  We have big 9-11 developments for you today.
[00:01:01.724 --> 00:01:09.329]  Also news on the war, the police state, the economy, weather modification, chemtrails.
[00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:11.951]  It's all coming up today.
[00:01:27.379 --> 00:01:41.765]  It feels like a Tuesday because I just got back yesterday, but today is Thursday, the 26th day, and we're very honored to have you with us in this 26th of April 2007 edition.
[00:01:41.805 --> 00:01:46.207]  We will be live for the next two hours and 59 minutes.
[00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:51.650]  Well, I've now been authorized to talk fully about Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.231]  I have now been authorized
[00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.952]  To tell you basically everything I know.
[00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:04.396]  And we will do that coming up in the next 6 or 7 minutes.
[00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.677]  When I get back from break, we will get into that.
[00:02:07.738 --> 00:02:09.098]  What really happened behind the scenes.
[00:02:09.118 --> 00:02:12.120]  We gave you a lot of it yesterday, but even more today.
[00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:15.982]  Paul Watson will be writing an article in the next hour on this.
[00:02:16.063 --> 00:02:17.183]  This is breaking news.
[00:02:17.663 --> 00:02:21.406]  I was just given authorization 10 minutes ago.
[00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:23.327]  10 minutes before showtime.
[00:02:24.841 --> 00:02:27.143]  Always frantic right before we go on air.
[00:02:27.884 --> 00:02:29.025]  And so that is coming up.
[00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:35.190]  Also, we've got new North American Union clips from Lou Dobbs with Pastor, the guy pushing all this, testifying before Congress.
[00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.431]  I didn't know about that.
[00:02:36.471 --> 00:02:37.752]  It's horrible video.
[00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:40.094]  Just admitting the North American Union.
[00:02:40.394 --> 00:02:42.136]  And then he comes back on the show and denies it.
[00:02:43.137 --> 00:02:44.518]  I mean, you talk about brainwashing.
[00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:50.629]  John Stewart with a comical piece I want to analyze, because it's not funny about Bush and his lying.
[00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:58.256]  Keith Olbermann really calls Giuliani out on his terrorism, because when they use terror to get their way and get their agenda, they are now terrorists.
[00:02:58.677 --> 00:02:59.898]  Keith Olbermann tells it like it is.
[00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.901]  We'll play the Rosie Trump clip back and forth.
[00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:06.925]  And again, I don't get into Anna Nicole Smith and Imus and all those diversions.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.201]  I'm getting into this because this is an attack on free speech.
[00:03:10.542 --> 00:03:14.904]  I guess I did cover some items because it was, but the point is we're not talking about things like O.J.
[00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:17.685]  Simpson or the lacrosse team or all of that.
[00:03:18.826 --> 00:03:23.909]  Though it is an interesting phenomenon how women will just make stuff up if you scorn them or are rude to them.
[00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.171]  They just think it's their right to just lie and say you raped them or say you threatened them.
[00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:32.013]  That's why they always get shocked when they end up going to jail over lying.
[00:03:33.638 --> 00:03:50.809]  I probably should have talked about the lacrosse situation, but the point is we stay focused on the really big issues of the value of the dollar, the national sovereignty, the second amendment, the illegal alien invasion, government-sponsored terror, foreign wars, genetic engineering, the things that are really hurting all of us.
[00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:58.754]  I don't care what color you are, or if you put your pants on one leg at a time, or if you have a valet doing it.
[00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:13.566]  The point here is, this show is about serious issues, and this is serious, and they're lying about Rosie, and saying this is a big victory for the censors and the blacklist, when in reality, she took an incredible stand, an honorable stand of courage.
[00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:15.046]  I disagree with a lot of things she does.
[00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:16.447]  I do.
[00:04:17.188 --> 00:04:19.008]  And Rosie O'Donnell knows my politics.
[00:04:19.048 --> 00:04:20.409]  She knows John Connor's politics.
[00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:22.430]  She's talked about it on the show with John Connor.
[00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.471]  She's praised him.
[00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:28.413]  He's an anti-abortion, anti-lesbian conservative.
[00:04:29.131 --> 00:04:30.532]  And they have talked about it.
[00:04:30.732 --> 00:04:31.673]  Ebersole knows that.
[00:04:31.974 --> 00:04:32.754]  O'Donnell knows that.
[00:04:32.974 --> 00:04:33.795]  They still like him.
[00:04:34.536 --> 00:04:35.617]  Well, I like them, too.
[00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:40.040]  Because they at least believe in what they're doing and they're trying to be good people.
[00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:41.842]  My God, look at Christ.
[00:04:41.862 --> 00:04:43.944]  He hung around with prostitutes and tax collectors.
[00:04:44.504 --> 00:04:45.845]  At least we know where they stand.
[00:04:46.225 --> 00:04:48.668]  Not these fake Christians, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:48.688 --> 00:04:49.949]  Most of them are devil worshippers.
[00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.970]  And I mean that when I say it.
[00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.274]  I mean, a lot of these big-time Christians are the most hardcore sadists you can imagine.
[00:04:58.243 --> 00:04:59.084]  And I've had enough of it.
[00:04:59.104 --> 00:05:02.168]  They make Christians like myself, who try to be a Christian, look bad.
[00:05:02.188 --> 00:05:04.350]  Alright, I'm already digressing.
[00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:05.412]  I'm already getting into Rosie.
[00:05:10.338 --> 00:05:12.761]  Got a They Live clip coming up to intro this next segment.
[00:05:12.781 --> 00:05:13.521]  Stay with us for that.
[00:05:14.282 --> 00:05:15.904]  Just wait till I give you the news.
[00:05:15.944 --> 00:05:16.505]  Just wait.
[00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:17.126]  I am
[00:05:18.243 --> 00:05:20.066]  Locked and loaded, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:20.126 --> 00:05:21.387]  Loaded for bear, as they say.
[00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:22.409]  I'm a B-52.
[00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.732]  Absolutely can barely take off.
[00:05:24.772 --> 00:05:26.173]  I've got so many info bombs.
[00:05:26.634 --> 00:05:28.316]  I'm gonna drop on the new old order's head.
[00:05:28.336 --> 00:05:29.538]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:30.219]  InfoWars.com.
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:43.065]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:05:43.465 --> 00:05:51.012]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:58.857]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:10.666]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:14.529]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:16.911]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:21.054]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:06:34.381 --> 00:06:35.122]  Terrorism!
[00:06:35.302 --> 00:06:36.022]  Terrorism!
[00:06:36.142 --> 00:06:42.206]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attacks, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:42.467 --> 00:06:44.068]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:44.308 --> 00:06:46.789]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:47.170 --> 00:07:01.739]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:02.100]  government.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.021]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:07:04.441 --> 00:07:10.366]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:07:10.486 --> 00:07:14.990]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.575]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:07:20.735 --> 00:07:21.956]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:07:22.036 --> 00:07:22.556]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:07:22.616 --> 00:07:24.678]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:35.413 --> 00:07:40.835]  This is Jack Blood with the Genesis Radio Network, and I have an urgent message for our listeners.
[00:07:41.275 --> 00:07:45.997]  The mass media keeps telling us that we are the richest, most powerful economy in the world.
[00:07:46.397 --> 00:07:49.038]  If this is true, why can't we pay our bills?
[00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.940]  Why is the United States the world's largest debtor nation?
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.042]  The truth is that we are in the worst debt bubble in our nation's history.
[00:07:58.462 --> 00:08:01.644]  When the bubble bursts, will you be able to feed your family?
[00:08:02.264 --> 00:08:05.085]  When the inevitable crash occurs, will you be ready?
[00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:08.021]  Call Whitehurst International at 1-888-892-6238.
[00:08:08.061 --> 00:08:10.162]  That's 1-888-892-6238 for the following two free reports.
[00:08:10.182 --> 00:08:10.523]  U.S.
[00:08:10.583 --> 00:08:12.224]  Debt Bubble Red Alert and Real Estate Crash.
[00:08:12.244 --> 00:08:12.624]  Call 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:13.745]  That's 1-888-8XANADU.
[00:08:13.765 --> 00:08:14.626]  Ask for George.
[00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.540]  Our impulses are being redirected.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:45.123]  We are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness that resembles sleep.
[00:08:47.884 --> 00:08:50.486]  The poor and the underclass are growing.
[00:08:51.026 --> 00:08:54.267]  Racial justice and human rights are non-existent.
[00:08:54.968 --> 00:09:00.451]  They have created a repressive society and we are their unwitting accomplices.
[00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:06.513]  They are dismantling the sleeping middle class.
[00:09:07.033 --> 00:09:09.955]  More and more people are becoming poor.
[00:09:09.995 --> 00:09:14.177]  Their intention to rule rests with the annihilation of consciousness.
[00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:17.637]  We have been lulled into a trance.
[00:09:17.717 --> 00:09:21.600]  They have made us indifferent to ourselves, to others.
[00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:24.623]  We are focused only on our own gain.
[00:09:25.703 --> 00:09:30.367]  Please understand, they are safe as long as they are not discovered.
[00:09:30.667 --> 00:09:33.029]  That is their primary method of survival.
[00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:37.152]  Keep us asleep, keep us selfish, keep us sedated.
[00:09:38.754 --> 00:09:39.854]  We are their castle.
[00:09:40.395 --> 00:09:42.316]  We are being bred for slavery.
[00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:55.369]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:09:55.869 --> 00:09:58.310]  Run on for a long time.
[00:09:58.811 --> 00:10:00.951]  Run on for a long time.
[00:10:01.652 --> 00:10:04.153]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:07.054]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:10:09.276 --> 00:10:23.906]  Go tell that long-tongued liar Go and tell that midnight rider Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter Tell him that God's gonna cut him down Tell him that God's gonna cut him down
[00:10:29.109 --> 00:10:54.495]  Well, my goodness gracious, let me tell you the news My head's been wet with the midnight dew I've been down on bended knee Talking to the man from Cali He spoke to me in a voice so sweet I thought I heard the shuffle of angels sweet He called my name and my heart stood still When he said, John, go do my will Don't tell that long-tongued liar
[00:10:55.235 --> 00:10:57.536]  Go and tell that midnight rider.
[00:10:58.137 --> 00:11:01.238]  Tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter.
[00:11:01.558 --> 00:11:03.699]  Tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[00:11:03.779 --> 00:11:07.221]  Tell them that God's gonna cut them down.
[00:11:09.282 --> 00:11:11.924]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:11:12.524 --> 00:11:14.845]  Run on for a long time.
[00:11:15.465 --> 00:11:17.606]  Run on for a long time.
[00:11:18.347 --> 00:11:20.808]  Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
[00:11:21.308 --> 00:11:23.850]  Sooner or later, God'll cut you down.
[00:11:25.906 --> 00:11:34.529]  Well, he may throw you a rock, hide your hand, workin' in the dark against your fellow man, but he's sure as God made black and white.
[00:11:34.829 --> 00:11:37.450]  What's done in the dark will be brought to the light.
[00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:40.371]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:42.513]  That says it all!
[00:11:57.333 --> 00:12:06.122]  Go and tell that midnight rider, tell the rambler, the gambler, the backbiter, tell them that God's gonna cut you down.
[00:12:06.542 --> 00:12:09.185]  Tell them that God's gonna cut you down.
[00:12:09.485 --> 00:12:12.328]  Tell them that God's gonna cut you down.
[00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:20.016]  Absolutely, it does say it all, Johnny Cash from the grave, live on the radio.
[00:12:22.153 --> 00:12:25.938]  You know, I am really debating some other things I've learned.
[00:12:25.958 --> 00:12:28.441]  It just gets more bizarre by the minute.
[00:12:29.482 --> 00:12:38.393]  When I was out in Hollywood just Monday and Tuesday, I learned even more about who's awake to 9-11.
[00:12:38.433 --> 00:12:39.655]  It totally blew me away.
[00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:50.122]  But, you know what, I wasn't told not to talk about it, but I think it goes without saying that I don't talk about things, so I guess it meant that I wasn't meant to talk about it.
[00:12:50.602 --> 00:12:51.503]  So I won't get into that.
[00:12:51.523 --> 00:12:57.167]  You know, having to keep secrets is not fun from an audience, especially when you learn about the prominent people that know about 9-11.
[00:12:57.267 --> 00:13:10.376]  Let's just say there's a popular police state TV show that we badmouth a lot, and I'm going to leave it there.
[00:13:10.536 --> 00:13:11.657]  I'm not going to say anything else.
[00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:14.888]  It just never ends, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:16.648 --> 00:13:22.670]  And I don't know how people can rationalize being involved with something like that and then go, oh, well, I know all about it.
[00:13:23.270 --> 00:13:28.351]  But that's probably why you saw a shift in the show about a year ago to where the government's planning nukes and things like that.
[00:13:28.832 --> 00:13:32.893]  I guess they, well... You know what?
[00:13:32.933 --> 00:13:34.033]  I'm going to shut my mouth.
[00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:35.173]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:13:35.814 --> 00:13:36.814]  I'm going to stop right there.
[00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.412]  I told you that everybody in Hollywood knows about this.
[00:13:46.373 --> 00:13:55.077]  Literally everyone I ever talked to, and I asked them, well who else knows, and they go A, B, C, D, E, F, G, down to Z. And they need to go public, they need to speak out.
[00:13:55.317 --> 00:14:03.381]  You know, I didn't intend for Rick Linklater to be on here, to be on this show six months ago, and just out of the blue start talking about 9-11 being an inside job.
[00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:10.804]  I mean, Rick's known for a couple years, he's seen Martial Law, he's seen Terror Storm, he liked them, he got hundreds of them from me and given them out to people.
[00:14:11.676 --> 00:14:14.658]  And he just starts talking about how it's an inside job, and his friends all know.
[00:14:14.718 --> 00:14:18.500]  And by the way, he gave one to Bruce Willis when he was here doing Fast Food Nation with him.
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:23.483]  And Bruce Willis, you know, sent him an email saying, yeah, now I've woken up to the truth.
[00:14:24.084 --> 00:14:26.605]  But then don't expect Bruce Willis to ever go public.
[00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:37.312]  He got a bunch of heat, and then through the author of some book that supposedly went into a Bruce Willis army movie, he said, I've talked to Bruce, and Bruce says no comment.
[00:14:38.012 --> 00:14:39.473]  And that, you know, that's not what he meant.
[00:14:39.853 --> 00:14:45.057]  You know, admitting that he did say it, but backing off, kind of like, you will deny me three times.
[00:14:47.398 --> 00:14:49.480]  Who was it that denied Christ three times?
[00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.822]  And before the cock crows, you'll deny me three times.
[00:14:52.842 --> 00:14:54.303]  And then when he thought he was going to get killed, he did.
[00:14:55.964 --> 00:14:56.985]  No, it wasn't Judas.
[00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:58.406]  He's with the 30 pieces of silver.
[00:14:59.086 --> 00:15:00.888]  Believe me, if I wasn't on air, I'd know the name.
[00:15:00.948 --> 00:15:02.189]  It's ridiculously easy.
[00:15:02.689 --> 00:15:04.430]  Then I'll get a bunch of people going, you don't remember that?
[00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:05.511]  Yeah, sometimes I can't remember
[00:15:06.218 --> 00:15:07.599]  What year my son was born.
[00:15:07.639 --> 00:15:09.360]  You know, sometimes your memory doesn't work.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:11.041]  Sometimes it works on everything.
[00:15:11.081 --> 00:15:11.702]  It's weird.
[00:15:11.722 --> 00:15:14.724]  I have like a semi-photographic memory.
[00:15:15.144 --> 00:15:16.425]  Sometimes I remember everything.
[00:15:17.346 --> 00:15:18.186]  Or on certain things.
[00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:19.687]  I remember something from 10 years ago perfectly.
[00:15:19.707 --> 00:15:23.330]  And then other times my brain wasn't in the proper mode when I'm trying to remember it.
[00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:23.970]  I don't remember.
[00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.451]  It's because it's not photographic.
[00:15:26.912 --> 00:15:29.594]  But I'm already digressing here.
[00:15:29.634 --> 00:15:32.656]  The point is they'll deny 9-11 truth when they get out in the public.
[00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:38.616]  And, uh, I had no intention of getting Linklater to go public on 9-11 on the show.
[00:15:38.996 --> 00:15:44.239]  I had no intention of him to spill the beans on, uh, Bruce Willis.
[00:15:44.479 --> 00:15:45.820]  He told me that a few months before.
[00:15:48.861 --> 00:15:52.824]  But, uh, it's just amazing.
[00:15:54.204 --> 00:15:54.705]  It's amazing.
[00:15:54.725 --> 00:15:58.947]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff, too, that we report here on this show, and it just kind of gets glazed over.
[00:15:59.893 --> 00:16:11.301]  And every week or so we have some engineer, some fighter pilot, or commercial pilot, or both, or another physicist, or another first responder, or another widow on.
[00:16:11.902 --> 00:16:14.644]  But when they come on, the media predominantly ignores it.
[00:16:17.065 --> 00:16:21.869]  It hardly gets attention when one of Bush's chief economists goes public on this show over a year ago.
[00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:25.892]  It gets attention
[00:16:27.825 --> 00:16:33.407]  When a Rosie O'Donnell goes public, it gets attention.
[00:16:33.447 --> 00:16:37.729]  When a Charlie Sheen goes public, it gets attention.
[00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:42.591]  A lot of attention when prominent people speak out.
[00:16:44.772 --> 00:16:45.872]  And that's why it's important.
[00:16:47.433 --> 00:16:51.474]  And it's also they have to be commended because they have amazing courage.
[00:16:52.214 --> 00:16:53.015]  They're not stupid.
[00:16:53.035 --> 00:16:53.935]  They're not stupid.
[00:16:54.395 --> 00:16:55.155]  They're not stupid.
[00:16:57.145 --> 00:16:59.266]  They know they're going to be put through a wringer.
[00:16:59.546 --> 00:17:00.686]  And they're going to get death threats.
[00:17:01.346 --> 00:17:05.367]  And these are already very private people who don't particularly want to be controversial.
[00:17:05.687 --> 00:17:08.008]  But they have a conscience and they want to speak out.
[00:17:08.448 --> 00:17:10.269]  They're just like everybody else who's speaking out.
[00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.749]  It's just they're prominent.
[00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:12.729]  They're stars.
[00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:15.930]  They're media phenomenons.
[00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:21.332]  And so they're doing it literally because they care.
[00:17:21.852 --> 00:17:26.193]  And they're putting their heads in the tiger's jaws for us.
[00:17:30.504 --> 00:17:33.146]  So I'll tell you about Rosie O'Donnell and the new developments right now.
[00:17:35.068 --> 00:17:42.554]  Now, I got a lot of this from Christina Ebersole, but it wasn't even said, hey, don't tell anybody.
[00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:47.818]  It was just, this is kind of off the record, but I guess you could say some of it, just basically don't say where you got it.
[00:17:48.378 --> 00:17:49.619]  Christine goes on vacation with her.
[00:17:49.659 --> 00:17:53.182]  We're just on vacation with her and other friends in Miami a few weeks ago.
[00:17:53.602 --> 00:17:55.764]  Christina, obviously, I mean, we could see what was going on.
[00:17:56.573 --> 00:18:02.075]  Three or four months ago, they've got James Brolin on, hundreds of movies, dozens of TV shows.
[00:18:02.635 --> 00:18:06.177]  He's on there, and he goes, hey, I went and visited this 9-11 truth site.
[00:18:07.097 --> 00:18:07.978]  What is it?
[00:18:07.998 --> 00:18:08.998]  9-11-we-know-dot-com?
[00:18:09.058 --> 00:18:09.698]  I think that's it.
[00:18:10.879 --> 00:18:13.740]  And he just said, that's all I want to say, just check it out.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.941]  And there's this knowing look from Barbara Walters, knowing look, smile from Rosie.
[00:18:18.542 --> 00:18:21.683]  Rosie uses the excuse of going, yeah, that John Connor,
[00:18:22.754 --> 00:18:23.494]  He gets up there.
[00:18:23.534 --> 00:18:24.615]  He's a non-conformist.
[00:18:24.635 --> 00:18:26.315]  He goes, 9-11's an inside job.
[00:18:26.336 --> 00:18:27.736]  9-11's an inside job.
[00:18:28.216 --> 00:18:29.117]  That's her way.
[00:18:29.137 --> 00:18:30.177]  She was testing the waters.
[00:18:30.457 --> 00:18:32.538]  Then she starts blogging, putting it out on her blog.
[00:18:33.058 --> 00:18:34.719]  And we get a report from People Magazine.
[00:18:35.039 --> 00:18:36.640]  Barbara Walters says, stop blogging.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.961]  She doesn't want Rosie speaking outside of what... That's an admission of the censorship.
[00:18:41.382 --> 00:18:43.863]  You don't have to believe me or believe Rosie or believe Ebersol.
[00:18:45.203 --> 00:18:46.904]  So let me just get into this and give you all the basics.
[00:18:46.924 --> 00:18:47.744]  I don't even know where to start.
[00:18:50.988 --> 00:18:56.073]  I learned from Ebersole, I learned from Rodriguez, and now I can tell you the prominent 9-11 truth.
[00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:59.075]  There's photos of him and her apartment in New York.
[00:19:00.937 --> 00:19:03.339]  Photos, you know, with Rodriguez and her.
[00:19:03.419 --> 00:19:12.547]  Her with Rodriguez's key, and he had the key, went up the stairwells to let the firemen, he directed them, because they're not continuous stairwells, they're staggered.
[00:19:12.568 --> 00:19:14.689]  One of the big heroes of 9-11.
[00:19:17.837 --> 00:19:22.018]  And he was talking to her for months, me having meetings with her repeatedly.
[00:19:22.038 --> 00:19:34.800]  So I was being told the same things, and then I got some emails from Rosie that will read some emails with her comments about 9-11 that Rodriguez and others, you know, quietly share with me.
[00:19:34.820 --> 00:19:38.261]  I don't think I will even release exactly the details of those here on air.
[00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:44.322]  Some of it's pretty, I mean, some of the stuff would be top headlines, I assure you, if anybody saw these emails.
[00:19:45.123 --> 00:19:47.745]  Pretty classic Rosie type statements.
[00:19:48.325 --> 00:19:53.049]  I'll just say about Tom DeLay and people like that.
[00:19:55.711 --> 00:19:58.853]  But, you know, now we can talk about it.
[00:19:58.933 --> 00:20:00.134]  And why can we talk about it?
[00:20:00.454 --> 00:20:03.176]  She tried to talk about William Rodriguez today on the live show.
[00:20:03.216 --> 00:20:03.796]  It's Thursday.
[00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:09.560]  And we'll tell you what happened when she tried to talk today.
[00:20:11.121 --> 00:20:14.524]  And that's why we can now talk about the Rodriguez situation.
[00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:17.335]  And he's been authorized to speak out.
[00:20:18.015 --> 00:20:18.856]  I talked to Rodriguez.
[00:20:18.876 --> 00:20:20.517]  He said, no, you just talk about it.
[00:20:20.657 --> 00:20:21.417]  I'm not going to come on.
[00:20:21.898 --> 00:20:24.459]  He'll probably come on later this week, maybe Friday, maybe tomorrow.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.982]  Probably get Vito Valente on as well, one of the first responders.
[00:20:29.222 --> 00:20:30.223]  He'll be on the show tomorrow.
[00:20:31.444 --> 00:20:32.104]  On The View tomorrow.

[00:21:41.613 --> 00:21:46.436]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[00:21:46.637 --> 00:21:49.378]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[00:21:49.439 --> 00:21:50.519]  dollar can be devalued.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:56.483]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[00:21:57.404 --> 00:22:04.669]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.

[00:23:38.238 --> 00:23:47.148]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:54.817]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?

[00:24:47.814 --> 00:25:03.767]  Into this house we're born Into this world we're thrown Like a dog without a bone An actor out on loan Writers on the storm
[00:25:06.381 --> 00:25:07.722]  Ah, well said!
[00:25:35.035 --> 00:25:40.837]  If you give this man a ride... Well, my sweet, we're gonna die.
[00:25:43.418 --> 00:25:45.839]  His brain is squirming like a toad.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.780]  That's that killer on the road!
[00:25:49.521 --> 00:25:51.282]  Take a long holiday, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:51.322 --> 00:25:52.282]  Get back to basics.
[00:25:53.102 --> 00:25:54.243]  Let your children play.
[00:25:54.943 --> 00:25:55.543]  Love each other.
[00:25:55.563 --> 00:25:58.685]  Stop being such greedy, backstabbing backbiters.
[00:25:59.865 --> 00:26:01.726]  So many times what you see in others is really...
[00:26:02.961 --> 00:26:05.582]  Really a reflection of yourself, so we should all look inwardly.
[00:26:08.483 --> 00:26:11.005]  Alright, here we go.
[00:26:11.025 --> 00:26:16.867]  Alright, Rosie O'Donnell, let me just boil it down in a nutshell.
[00:26:16.887 --> 00:26:18.328]  A. The media is lying.
[00:26:19.068 --> 00:26:22.550]  Fox News, John Gibson, all of them are saying she's fired.
[00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:25.231]  Donald Trump, who is a complete joke.
[00:26:25.491 --> 00:26:27.012]  The guy is a total performer.
[00:26:29.313 --> 00:26:32.294]  Everybody knows that he has been leveraged forever.
[00:26:33.997 --> 00:26:41.381]  And it's connected to some very seedy groups that are involved with casinos and gambling and things like that and the hotels.
[00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:43.922]  I mean, I don't think you need to put two and two together to figure this out.
[00:26:46.323 --> 00:26:48.444]  But fine, you know, it's America, Donald Trump, whatever.
[00:26:49.345 --> 00:26:53.467]  He's out saying she got fired and then calling her a fat pig and doing his normal thing.
[00:26:56.048 --> 00:26:57.489]  And they're all celebrating and lying.
[00:26:57.789 --> 00:27:00.190]  And she's classy in this respect.
[00:27:00.771 --> 00:27:03.352]  She's not even countering, going, hey, I quit.
[00:27:04.545 --> 00:27:07.947]  Though, if you actually read what ABC said, and you actually look at what happened, that's what she did.
[00:27:08.888 --> 00:27:09.949]  They wanted her for three years.
[00:27:09.989 --> 00:27:11.890]  They wanted to roughly double her money a year.
[00:27:12.791 --> 00:27:17.374]  She's already being offered other TV shows, because she's what really gave that show a kick in the pants.
[00:27:18.155 --> 00:27:20.376]  And Rosie is left.
[00:27:21.497 --> 00:27:26.901]  Now, I was told three weeks ago, almost three weeks ago, that she was going to probably leave The View.
[00:27:27.261 --> 00:27:29.963]  In fact, I was told, don't tell anybody she's leaving The View.
[00:27:30.323 --> 00:27:32.385]  I was told, probably going to leave The View by one person.
[00:27:33.123 --> 00:27:35.545]  And then I was told, I'm going to leave the view by another.
[00:27:35.585 --> 00:27:41.048]  I'm not going to say names, but you notice we reported to you a couple weeks ago she was going to have first responders on.
[00:27:41.388 --> 00:27:41.708]  Boom!
[00:27:41.928 --> 00:27:44.390]  She did the taping yesterday and it's tomorrow.
[00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:48.332]  I mean, some people even sent us emails questioning what we're saying here.
[00:27:49.393 --> 00:27:55.377]  Well, we're going to give you photos of her with William Rodriguez's key when she met with William Rodriguez months ago.
[00:27:55.397 --> 00:27:59.079]  I thought I'd get Willie on the phone and get the exact date of that.
[00:27:59.099 --> 00:28:00.500]  I think it was about five weeks ago.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:01.540]  I don't know.
[00:28:01.581 --> 00:28:02.141]  Time flies.
[00:28:03.778 --> 00:28:13.267]  But yes, ladies and gentlemen, we're in contact with Ebersole, we're in contact with Rosie, we're in contact with William Rodriguez, who's met with her multiple times and talked to her many times over the telephone.
[00:28:14.508 --> 00:28:16.489]  And she tried, and now I can talk about it!
[00:28:17.911 --> 00:28:20.533]  She tried to get William Rodriguez on as a guest.
[00:28:20.593 --> 00:28:22.775]  She's been told by the Neocon she's not allowed to do that.
[00:28:24.356 --> 00:28:28.460]  Because they checked into William Rodriguez, the producer of the show, who she's openly criticized.
[00:28:30.407 --> 00:28:34.308]  It turns out that she's not allowed to have William on because they found out he's a 9-11 intruder.
[00:28:35.628 --> 00:28:42.129]  I don't know how she wrangled it to be able to get first responders on, but these aren't first responders who come out and say it's an inside job.
[00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:43.529]  They say they have suspicions.
[00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.050]  Let's just say they were quiet about their views.
[00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:49.911]  They're more than on the fence.
[00:28:49.931 --> 00:28:51.071]  They're coming over to our side.
[00:28:53.411 --> 00:28:56.572]  William, by the way, was instrumental in giving the contacts
[00:28:57.176 --> 00:29:02.278]  For Valente and the other lady that's going on, it's a man and woman, to Rosie.
[00:29:02.459 --> 00:29:04.339]  So he was behind the scenes setting that up as well.
[00:29:07.481 --> 00:29:11.523]  Now the censorship started immediately within the first two weeks she was on the show.
[00:29:11.543 --> 00:29:16.325]  And I was told this by William, I was told this by Ebersole, and got this in email.
[00:29:16.345 --> 00:29:19.126]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:29:19.266 --> 00:29:22.168]  In the first two weeks she tried to mention the number of U.S.
[00:29:22.208 --> 00:29:22.448]  dead.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.141]  And she was told, you will not talk about dead U.S.
[00:29:26.161 --> 00:29:27.102]  soldiers on this show.
[00:29:27.502 --> 00:29:29.303]  Now, man, that is censorship!
[00:29:30.104 --> 00:29:40.009]  See, they don't want you to see the coffins, they don't want the photographs, the parents have to get the coffins separately, the flag-draped sarcophagi, and bring the media out.
[00:29:40.250 --> 00:29:44.512]  They don't like you to see that, them coming into Maine.
[00:29:48.955 --> 00:29:50.235]  They don't like you seeing that.
[00:29:52.136 --> 00:29:53.057]  They're very upset about it.
[00:29:54.381 --> 00:30:05.610]  And so they were censoring her out of the gates and letting the nitwit, the fake conservative, Hasselbeck say whatever she wanted and call the Iraqis animals.
[00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:06.831]  That really made Rosie mad.
[00:30:07.172 --> 00:30:09.533]  She wanted to leave within just a few weeks of being there.
[00:30:10.214 --> 00:30:12.396]  And it's been a constant censorship.
[00:30:12.436 --> 00:30:14.017]  She could only get stuff out on the live show.
[00:30:14.237 --> 00:30:15.478]  We'll tell you about all the censorship.
[00:30:15.739 --> 00:30:17.460]  We'll tell you how she met with William Rodriguez.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.222]  We'll tell you the rest of it when we get back, then get into all the other news.
[00:30:20.623 --> 00:30:21.043]  Stay with me.
[00:30:24.924 --> 00:30:25.825]  We're on the march.
[00:30:26.325 --> 00:30:27.926]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:30:27.946 --> 00:30:31.649]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:35.211 --> 00:30:36.212]  How are you feeling today?
[00:30:36.432 --> 00:30:43.137]  Well, I ask because if you have health challenges, then reading our free e-booklet about the most amazing discovery of our time is crucial.
[00:30:43.397 --> 00:30:47.860]  The booklet is about an amazing fruit from Southeast Asia they call mangosteen.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:53.824]  It's a centuries-old medicinal fruit whose time has come, and it has amassed 40 years of published research.
[00:30:54.124 --> 00:30:59.207]  We have information and testimonials from all over the world about the health potential of this amazing fruit.
[00:30:59.447 --> 00:31:05.971]  The powerful botanical has contributed to the well-being of millions of people the world over with health concerns just like yours.
[00:31:06.291 --> 00:31:09.453]  You can have this 22-page e-booklet absolutely free.

[00:31:16.498 --> 00:31:24.286]  Find out why mangosteen is known as the queen of all fruits and why it's fast becoming the best-selling wellness product ever brought to the market.
[00:31:24.626 --> 00:31:26.128]  Your health is in your hands.
[00:31:26.408 --> 00:31:27.589]  Do something about it today.
[00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:28.150]  Call 800-658-0597.
[00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:28.590]  Again, that's 800-658-0597.
[00:31:35.718 --> 00:31:44.350]  David J. Smith, did you know that a plan was laid down in the 1870s to conquer the world for world government that has not been deviated from since its inception?
[00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:50.117]  These conspirators said that they must have many revolutionary wars and three world wars.
[00:31:50.838 --> 00:31:56.822]  Have we witnessed these wars of liberation since the 1920s and then World War I and World War II?
[00:31:57.523 --> 00:32:05.969]  The Illuminati, who are worshippers of Lucifer, are now preparing for the final conflict, the Third World War, to produce their One World Government.
[00:32:06.704 --> 00:32:14.349]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming about by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:16.570]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:16.590 --> 00:32:16.910]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:18.071]  Call now to request your subscription.
[00:32:18.151 --> 00:32:20.973]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:32:34.768 --> 00:32:35.589]  Attention gardeners!
[00:32:35.649 --> 00:32:38.012]  This is an urgent GCN self-reliance update.
[00:32:38.253 --> 00:32:42.598]  GCN has just discovered a new bioactive superfood for garden plants, flowers, and herbs.
[00:32:42.798 --> 00:32:50.668]  It's called Proto-Gro and it's so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil and light conditions.
[00:32:50.988 --> 00:32:53.810]  Now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for self-reliance.
[00:32:54.090 --> 00:33:01.636]  Proto-Gro's unique blend of sea nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set, creating maximum plant growth in minimum time.
[00:33:01.736 --> 00:33:07.319]  Proto-Gro works by providing geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for nutritional uptake in plants.
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:13.123]  Proto-Gro's full spectrum plant fertility means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times the nutritional value.
[00:33:13.384 --> 00:33:16.646]  And if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs or wheatgrass, you can.
[00:33:16.926 --> 00:33:20.287]  If you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with non-hybrids, it's now easy.
[00:33:20.528 --> 00:33:25.550]  GCN listeners who want to grow Dervsheep superfoods should visit the Proto-Gro website at growlikecrazy.com.
[00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.451]  That's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365.
[00:33:28.511 --> 00:33:28.751]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:33:37.882 --> 00:33:38.362]  Don't worry.
[00:33:38.842 --> 00:33:40.363]  This show is documented.
[00:33:40.863 --> 00:33:43.704]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:44.065 --> 00:33:47.546]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:48.006 --> 00:33:52.068]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:33:52.628 --> 00:33:54.529]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:55.609 --> 00:34:02.995]  Alright, welcome back to the Ring of Fire, ladies and gentlemen, as we fight the New World Disorder.
[00:34:03.055 --> 00:34:08.299]  I'm going to take your calls in the second and third hour.
[00:34:08.399 --> 00:34:10.841]  Wide open phones today.
[00:34:23.297 --> 00:34:29.581]  We could have unlimited guests here on this show, but we only choose to have guests that really matter or that are extremely important.
[00:34:29.921 --> 00:34:35.425]  I am going to have a guest on in the next few days about the move to go ahead and try to pass Codex Alimentarius.
[00:34:36.225 --> 00:34:40.048]  Again, to start restricting vitamins and minerals and different supplements.
[00:34:41.529 --> 00:34:45.111]  All part of international regulatory agreements that have already been signed.
[00:34:45.131 --> 00:34:51.395]  That's why they fight tooth and nail like a mad dragon to get this through.
[00:34:54.267 --> 00:34:56.288]  Also, I'm going to get Pastor Ted Pike on.
[00:34:58.009 --> 00:35:03.551]  My producer is out because, again, her family member, her uncle, has been on death's doorstep.
[00:35:03.571 --> 00:35:04.451]  He is in and out.
[00:35:04.471 --> 00:35:05.552]  He could die any moment.
[00:35:06.492 --> 00:35:16.316]  But, again, we actually had guests today and canceled them because I really found myself going into a phase of not having as many guests on.
[00:35:16.816 --> 00:35:22.819]  And I do this from time to time, only really important news and information and not petty distractions or
[00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:27.772]  Cronyism here on this show.
[00:35:30.533 --> 00:35:30.853]  Okay.
[00:35:32.974 --> 00:35:35.895]  Getting back to Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:35:39.316 --> 00:35:50.179]  The reason we're talking about this is A. She has a lot of courage and she supercharged, yet again, the exploding 9-11 truth movement that is the foundation, the key to bringing down the New World Order.
[00:35:51.963 --> 00:36:09.272]  Because if we can convince the general public that most terrorism is an inside job, and that giving up liberty will not give them security, it will give them tyranny, then the 9-11 attacks, the war is built on them, the domestic police state, the surveillance state, it's all built on that.
[00:36:10.572 --> 00:36:12.753]  I mean, Alberto Gonzales gets in trouble for crimes?
[00:36:12.873 --> 00:36:17.276]  Hey, 9-11, if you go after me, the terrorist will get you.
[00:36:17.576 --> 00:36:19.817]  If you don't re-elect us, the terrorist will nuke Chicago.
[00:36:20.681 --> 00:36:22.922]  If you don't elect me, Al Qaeda will hit you.
[00:36:22.982 --> 00:36:23.962]  I mean, they're the terrorists.
[00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:27.183]  Out in the open, they're saying, do what we say or bad things are going to happen.
[00:36:27.223 --> 00:36:27.863]  They're the terrorists.
[00:36:27.903 --> 00:36:28.403]  Bottom line.
[00:36:29.103 --> 00:36:29.963]  They even act like it.
[00:36:29.983 --> 00:36:32.244]  It's not even just the evidence that they did it.
[00:36:32.324 --> 00:36:33.304]  They also act like it.
[00:36:33.524 --> 00:36:37.025]  They have the motive, and they act just like someone who had the motive, who was behind it, would.
[00:36:37.265 --> 00:36:38.785]  Do what I say or bad stuff's going to happen.
[00:36:40.306 --> 00:36:41.826]  So we've got to destroy the 9-11 myth.
[00:36:41.846 --> 00:36:42.806]  She's got a lot of courage.
[00:36:42.826 --> 00:36:43.687]  She's a tough broad.
[00:36:43.707 --> 00:36:46.727]  I was talking to Charlie Sheen.
[00:36:46.807 --> 00:36:48.228]  He said, yeah, she's a tough broad.
[00:36:48.268 --> 00:36:49.288]  I appreciate what she's doing.
[00:36:50.816 --> 00:36:51.336]  That's a quote.
[00:36:53.498 --> 00:36:54.399]  Let me get the exact quote.
[00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:56.700]  Yeah, I like her.
[00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.181]  She's got a lot of courage.
[00:36:58.682 --> 00:37:00.043]  She's a tough broad.
[00:37:04.066 --> 00:37:17.616]  But, um... Going back to... Again, there's so much... I should really write notes up on something like this before I go on air with it, because for months I've been keeping my mouth shut.
[00:37:18.379 --> 00:37:26.566]  And when I get up here about all this, I mean, I've covered some of it, but just to recap, it's important, though, because they're trying to set a precedent to have a chilling effect.
[00:37:26.666 --> 00:37:29.889]  And, oh, look, they're saying, look, Don Imus got fired.
[00:37:30.049 --> 00:37:31.290]  Oh, Rosie got fired.
[00:37:31.850 --> 00:37:32.811]  Oh, my gosh!
[00:37:33.552 --> 00:37:36.234]  And it's kind of like a new purge to create fear.
[00:37:36.254 --> 00:37:38.776]  And I'm already seeing fear in other radio talk show hosts, I know.
[00:37:39.356 --> 00:37:44.060]  Not just on this network that people have told me about their fears that are totally unfounded.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.521]  There's no censorship or control here.
[00:37:45.581 --> 00:37:46.002]  I know that.
[00:37:46.062 --> 00:37:47.283]  Never experienced it, not once.
[00:37:48.895 --> 00:37:55.019]  But people in other talk radio stations and networks that I just talk with, and I hear talk shows talking about it on air, how they're scared now.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:59.142]  And watching what they say and thinking about what they're about to say.
[00:37:59.803 --> 00:38:01.284]  That kills the spontaneity.
[00:38:01.324 --> 00:38:02.925]  That kills the truth.
[00:38:03.065 --> 00:38:07.328]  And speaking from the heart, speaking from the gut, and wearing the facts on your sleeve.
[00:38:07.788 --> 00:38:08.869]  I don't calculate here.
[00:38:08.889 --> 00:38:10.210]  This is the real deal.
[00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:10.851]  So people listen.
[00:38:11.051 --> 00:38:12.612]  You can instinctively pick up on it.
[00:38:12.872 --> 00:38:13.833]  It's the body language.
[00:38:15.272 --> 00:38:18.513]  It's the way someone says something is more important than even what they're saying.
[00:38:19.793 --> 00:38:21.774]  I don't have to pre-script or think about what I'm going to say.
[00:38:21.794 --> 00:38:22.694]  It just flows.
[00:38:24.375 --> 00:38:27.495]  Because... I'm just speaking my mind.
[00:38:28.176 --> 00:38:30.156]  Well, see, they want to stop you from doing that.
[00:38:30.616 --> 00:38:32.977]  They want to stop people from... Don't talk about politics.
[00:38:32.997 --> 00:38:33.717]  Don't talk about religion.
[00:38:34.117 --> 00:38:35.338]  Don't bring up stuff with your neighbors.
[00:38:35.798 --> 00:38:40.599]  Just talk about your favorite wristwatch, your favorite football team, your favorite basketball team and just...
[00:38:41.368 --> 00:38:43.649]  Just everybody keep your heads down and shut up!
[00:38:43.729 --> 00:38:45.329]  That's not what America's all about!
[00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:49.471]  It's fundamentally American what Don Imus did.
[00:38:50.451 --> 00:38:51.571]  I don't like Don Imus.
[00:38:51.611 --> 00:38:59.394]  I've always found him just to radiate unpleasantness and dirtiness, disgustingness.
[00:38:59.654 --> 00:39:00.815]  I've never liked Don Imus.
[00:39:00.875 --> 00:39:02.635]  I'd see him on TV and go, just something about him.
[00:39:02.955 --> 00:39:04.296]  He was repulsive to me.
[00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:06.596]  I don't like what he said about those black women.
[00:39:07.177 --> 00:39:09.738]  But I know he just meant it trying to be gangster himself.
[00:39:10.178 --> 00:39:10.998]  He was trying to be hip.
[00:39:12.893 --> 00:39:16.595]  But it was fundamentally American to shoot your mouth off and just talk off the cuff.
[00:39:17.836 --> 00:39:22.199]  And I do agree with what Rosie O'Donnell has been saying.
[00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:27.822]  And what she has said is fundamentally American.
[00:39:28.162 --> 00:39:29.623]  Not because I agree with it, though.
[00:39:30.043 --> 00:39:31.864]  But because she's saying what she thinks.
[00:39:32.264 --> 00:39:33.145]  She's speaking her mind.
[00:39:34.989 --> 00:39:41.972]  It's fundamentally, I don't want to just monopolize it, just Americans have had this history, or that Americans are the only ones that stand up and speak out.
[00:39:42.372 --> 00:39:46.273]  You know, there's a lot of that across world history, but it's certainly more of it here than any other place.
[00:39:47.434 --> 00:39:57.858]  I guess the second place you might see it is the Roman Republic, to a certain limited degree, with gentry landowners, but that was still a limited voting system.
[00:39:58.718 --> 00:40:04.220]  And then, of course, England, which really is the engine of the ideas that really culminated for what we have here.
[00:40:05.661 --> 00:40:11.063]  Almost 48%, 47% of the parliament.
[00:40:11.083 --> 00:40:19.765]  I could pull that vote up again, but I was reading about that a few months ago again in a book I was reading about Captain Kidd, who wasn't really a pirate by the way, award-winning book I was reading.
[00:40:21.425 --> 00:40:27.087]  But it was just about the... No, it was another book I was, that's not right.
[00:40:27.127 --> 00:40:29.728]  Captain Kidd was in, got hung in I think 1706 or something.
[00:40:31.579 --> 00:40:44.642]  No, no, that was another book I was reading about George Washington a year ago, and I was reading the votes in Parliament for the freedom and secession and what happened here in the United States.
[00:40:45.902 --> 00:40:47.923]  Okay, see, I'm digressing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:48.003 --> 00:40:48.843]  I apologize.
[00:40:49.303 --> 00:40:51.123]  I know Paul Watson and Steve Watson are listening.
[00:40:51.143 --> 00:40:54.844]  They're wanting all the meat and potatoes about Rosie to write an article.
[00:40:58.205 --> 00:40:58.385]  But
[00:41:00.479 --> 00:41:28.631]  So that's why this is important, because it's fundamentally American and you've got these these cretins, these actual, and I'm here to tell you, and we have the proof, I went and actually pulled old news articles about this, so I wouldn't just say this, I would actually have them in front of me this morning, that Fox News is run by Viet Dinh of the Justice Department, that they do get government product placement at higher levels, and I call that propaganda placement, it's the government paying for
[00:41:29.517 --> 00:41:32.198]  Commercials and ideas and buying reporters.
[00:41:32.878 --> 00:41:38.020]  Roger Ailes, who created Rush Limbaugh, is admittedly advising Hillary and has monthly meetings.
[00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:44.062]  Murdoch has been having, for at least four years, weekly, multiple hour-long dinners with Hillary.
[00:41:44.863 --> 00:41:46.763]  That's why Limbaugh is saying she's going to win.
[00:41:47.444 --> 00:41:50.605]  She might even be better than other Democrats, he's been saying, at least she's for the war.
[00:41:51.565 --> 00:41:53.586]  That's why Fox News gives her more attention.
[00:41:54.146 --> 00:41:56.527]  Fox News is positioning Hillary Clinton.
[00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.771]  And they're going to suddenly be liberal.
[00:41:59.091 --> 00:41:59.951]  Just watch.
[00:42:00.332 --> 00:42:02.913]  They'll still be warmongering, but just liberal in name.
[00:42:03.253 --> 00:42:16.280]  And most Democrats will suddenly be for it, just like when Clinton used DU and bombed Belgrade into the Stone Age, and bombed four other major cities, and strafed huge crowds of refugees in Serbia, outside Pristina.
[00:42:17.981 --> 00:42:21.183]  Total butchery, total mass murder, and
[00:42:24.941 --> 00:42:26.022]  It doesn't matter to the Democrats.
[00:42:26.082 --> 00:42:33.685]  I mean, we're going to be in a reign of terror, of gun control, of anti-terror police, and suddenly, the Democrats are going to love it.
[00:42:33.725 --> 00:42:37.086]  We are in for... And it wouldn't matter if it was Republicans either.
[00:42:37.106 --> 00:42:38.207]  It'd be the same... You understand?
[00:42:38.247 --> 00:42:40.488]  It's two legs on the same creature.
[00:42:40.688 --> 00:42:50.252]  I know you know this, but explain it to your dumb uncle, or your dumb neighbor, or the dumb cop that lives down the street, who's got his car festooned with, support the troops, keep them in Iraq.
[00:42:50.552 --> 00:42:52.073]  Nobody, the troops want to come home.
[00:42:52.573 --> 00:42:54.214]  Support them, bring them back, you idiot.
[00:42:55.194 --> 00:43:02.358]  Foreign corporations have seized the United States for at least 50 years, and now they're waging war on the remnants of the middle class.
[00:43:02.378 --> 00:43:03.739]  Do you understand that, Peabrain?
[00:43:03.759 --> 00:43:05.760]  Do you understand we're the best friends you've got?
[00:43:06.541 --> 00:43:13.005]  All you bureaucrats and government servants, and all you toadies that are on these different neocon websites, you make me sick.
[00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:14.766]  You're little children.
[00:43:17.768 --> 00:43:22.931]  I mean, you're absolutely... You're absolutely off the charts.
[00:43:26.644 --> 00:43:28.025]  And I don't know what to say to you anymore.
[00:43:28.045 --> 00:43:28.746]  All right, let me get back to that.
[00:43:28.786 --> 00:43:31.509]  That's why I'm taking calls this hour, because I'm just taking my time discussing this.
[00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:33.711]  They're lying!
[00:43:34.211 --> 00:43:37.354]  Here is Fox News, YABC, Axe, Rosie O'Donnell.
[00:43:37.955 --> 00:43:39.716]  And they go on to say she was fired.
[00:43:40.417 --> 00:43:41.298]  It's a total lie.
[00:43:41.698 --> 00:43:42.299]  They don't care.
[00:43:42.539 --> 00:43:43.580]  This is the Pentagon.
[00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.633]  When you see Fox News, folks, that is actually the Pentagon.
[00:43:49.673 --> 00:43:54.898]  I don't mean that for a play on words or I'm being a little extreme.
[00:43:55.278 --> 00:43:56.259]  Go do your research.
[00:43:56.699 --> 00:43:57.880]  It's run by the government.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.021]  So is CNN, by the way.
[00:43:59.301 --> 00:44:00.622]  They're even on government satellites.
[00:44:00.642 --> 00:44:02.384]  It came out in what?
[00:44:02.804 --> 00:44:10.030]  2000 in the Washington Post that over 140 members of black ops, army, psychological warfare are there full-time?
[00:44:11.169 --> 00:44:15.355]  140.
[00:44:11.449 --> 00:44:15.355]  Remember when Gore Vidal went on CNN and he said, wow, things have changed.
[00:44:15.835 --> 00:44:21.544]  There isn't some colonel in a suit telling us what we can talk about in this taped interview.
[00:44:22.435 --> 00:44:38.408]  Do you understand, ladies and gentlemen, there are black-op officers, 55-year-old men, with 165 IQs, walking around in $3,000 suits at CNN and Fox, who've got high-security, you know, Delta-level clearances.
[00:44:38.428 --> 00:44:43.752]  Do you understand, that isn't Republican, that isn't liberal, that's military-industrial complex.
[00:44:43.912 --> 00:44:46.754]  The Pentagon runs the cameras that are in your town of 500 people.
[00:44:47.921 --> 00:44:49.143]  We're totally controlled.
[00:44:49.324 --> 00:44:51.688]  They're putting bio-weapons in the vaccines.
[00:44:51.948 --> 00:44:52.349]  Okay?
[00:44:52.809 --> 00:44:53.431]  Do you understand?
[00:44:53.451 --> 00:44:57.758]  They haven't killed me because they know it will water the Tree of Liberty.
[00:44:57.998 --> 00:45:00.042]  They know what Thomas Jefferson said is true.
[00:45:01.047 --> 00:45:07.709]  Now, when I get big enough, folks, I've studied history, if we're able to have the effect, I know they will probably kill me.
[00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.751]  I am literally walking into the jaws of death.
[00:45:10.791 --> 00:45:12.131]  But that's not any big deal.
[00:45:12.151 --> 00:45:14.012]  That's what men are supposed to do.
[00:45:14.192 --> 00:45:20.774]  I am waging war against enemies of the United States, against the Republic, that I have sworn to protect on the air.
[00:45:21.194 --> 00:45:22.875]  And I take that oath very seriously.
[00:45:24.301 --> 00:45:29.824]  I am doing this for my great-grandchildren, ladies and gentlemen, who won't exist unless we beat these people.
[00:45:30.185 --> 00:45:33.767]  We're talking about one-child policies very soon after the nuke attack.
[00:45:34.087 --> 00:45:35.908]  They can radically re-engineer society.
[00:45:36.128 --> 00:45:37.009]  We're being prepared.
[00:45:37.129 --> 00:45:42.772]  All this stuff you see is just the table setting for a massive feast on the carcass of America and the world.
[00:45:44.813 --> 00:45:45.174]  Okay?
[00:45:46.274 --> 00:45:47.215]  That's where this stands.
[00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:47.995]  Do you understand?
[00:45:48.296 --> 00:45:53.919]  Black-op military officers running CNN and Fox, ladies and gentlemen, is not freedom.
[00:45:55.041 --> 00:45:56.501]  Is not a good thing.
[00:45:57.101 --> 00:45:57.982]  That is scary.
[00:45:59.582 --> 00:46:01.382]  Alright, so Rosie O'Donnell slips in there.
[00:46:01.402 --> 00:46:05.023]  They think she'll put out an overall fake left agenda.
[00:46:05.403 --> 00:46:07.063]  She starts shooting her mouth off immediately.
[00:46:07.083 --> 00:46:09.064]  They tell her she can't talk about the dead soldiers.
[00:46:09.564 --> 00:46:18.005]  While the other twit on the show is Hasselbeck is calling the Iraqis animals.
[00:46:19.765 --> 00:46:20.806]  This is what Rosie said.
[00:46:20.866 --> 00:46:22.146]  I didn't see these programs.
[00:46:22.166 --> 00:46:22.986]  This is what she's saying.
[00:46:23.559 --> 00:46:25.260]  Hasselbeck's calling them animals.
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.940]  I can't bring up the number of dead U.S.
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.160]  troops.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:27.860]  They told me not to.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.461]  That started within the first two weeks.
[00:46:30.401 --> 00:46:30.681]  Okay?
[00:46:31.781 --> 00:46:32.962]  And then it was just continual.
[00:46:33.022 --> 00:46:35.042]  And then they would edit her.
[00:46:35.663 --> 00:46:40.024]  They would edit Rosie on the three tape shows.
[00:46:40.184 --> 00:46:44.245]  Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
[00:46:44.345 --> 00:46:46.706]  Tuesdays and Thursdays were live
[00:46:47.819 --> 00:46:57.522]  Seventy-five percent of the time, I was asking one of the people involved in the show, and they said, well, it's not, you know, it's usually live, but if there's some big event, we have those in case there's live stuff, like the shootings.
[00:46:58.182 --> 00:46:59.162]  And we can go live any day.
[00:46:59.623 --> 00:47:00.463]  Everybody's on call.
[00:47:01.943 --> 00:47:04.264]  So, she would try to slip stuff out on there.
[00:47:04.284 --> 00:47:07.845]  It was always on a Tuesday or a Thursday where she'd say 9-11's an inside job, or she'd say things.
[00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:13.327]  Today, by the way, didn't they install some type of ten-second delay?
[00:47:14.487 --> 00:47:17.468]  Even on the live program, and started blurping and blipping and cutting.
[00:47:18.064 --> 00:47:19.265]  That just happened last month.
[00:47:20.206 --> 00:47:20.987]  That was it for her.
[00:47:21.848 --> 00:47:23.269]  They said, hey, we're doubling your money.
[00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:24.931]  We want to give you a three-year contract.
[00:47:24.971 --> 00:47:25.631]  She said, no.
[00:47:26.552 --> 00:47:27.333]  I'm leaving.
[00:47:28.974 --> 00:47:30.856]  She said, I'm leaving.
[00:47:31.457 --> 00:47:39.044]  And by the way, it's not just our opinion or what Rosie said to us or what we learned from William Rodriguez or Christina Ebersole, a great lady.
[00:47:41.295 --> 00:47:44.639]  Here is one from September 4th, 2006.
[00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:47.943]  Barber doesn't want Rosie to blog People Magazine.
[00:47:48.964 --> 00:47:49.605]  See, right there.
[00:47:50.085 --> 00:47:52.969]  They didn't want her saying anything political outside the show.
[00:47:53.649 --> 00:47:54.911]  Outside of her show!
[00:47:56.893 --> 00:47:57.634]  They didn't want her.
[00:47:57.694 --> 00:47:58.535]  That's a big deal.
[00:47:59.036 --> 00:48:01.899]  They were telling her, shut up, outside of her show.
[00:48:03.762 --> 00:48:08.024]  No, so Rosie turns down double the money, a three-year contract.
[00:48:08.044 --> 00:48:11.466]  We're talking about tens of millions of dollars.
[00:48:15.087 --> 00:48:24.231]  And she walks away, and instead of the media going, look at that courage, look at her stand on her principles and being a hero for free speech of pure Americana.
[00:48:25.032 --> 00:48:27.072]  I mean, it literally makes my heart beat faster.
[00:48:27.793 --> 00:48:28.593]  Total respect.
[00:48:29.774 --> 00:48:32.955]  That's the spirit that will save this country.
[00:48:33.624 --> 00:48:37.846]  Despite all her other problems, and the fact that I disagree with her on about fifty percent of the stuff she's for.
[00:48:38.806 --> 00:48:41.628]  I'm with her on the war, 9-11, a lot of other issues she's wrong on some others.
[00:48:41.808 --> 00:48:42.988]  But by the way, she's coming along.
[00:48:43.028 --> 00:48:45.630]  She's into watching anti-New World Order movies every day.
[00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:47.210]  This is what she's into now.
[00:48:48.051 --> 00:48:53.153]  By the way, I can tell you, Rosie, again, the one that finally sent her over the edge, and I was told this by two sources, was Terror Storm.
[00:48:53.773 --> 00:48:55.774]  I'm not, you know, I'm not saying it because it's my film.
[00:48:55.995 --> 00:48:57.055]  Obviously, I want my film to be seen.
[00:48:57.095 --> 00:48:58.076]  It's for free on Google.
[00:48:58.596 --> 00:49:01.037]  But the point is, that sent her over the edge last September.
[00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.522]  That's what she talks about, Gulf of Tonkin, Mozadek.
[00:49:05.722 --> 00:49:10.566]  She's taken whole quotes out of Terror Storm and put it on her blog about false flag terror.
[00:49:10.886 --> 00:49:11.867]  She's used our voiceover.
[00:49:11.907 --> 00:49:12.948]  She's used what we've said.
[00:49:13.468 --> 00:49:14.028]  We knew that.
[00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:15.630]  We couldn't tell you about it.
[00:49:18.312 --> 00:49:18.932]  It's exciting.
[00:49:22.835 --> 00:49:28.079]  You know, we have to be prepared to actually win and take this country back, but everybody's convinced we're all going to lose because your preacher told you.
[00:49:28.279 --> 00:49:29.660]  Well, I don't care even if we're going to lose.
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.001]  I'm not going to go down without fighting.
[00:49:31.222 --> 00:49:32.803]  I'm not going to die in the ditch licking boots.
[00:49:35.402 --> 00:49:39.824]  But history shows if you're highly motivated and take action and you're in the right, you pretty much can't be beat.
[00:49:41.905 --> 00:49:44.006]  Let's say they took all our guns tomorrow, which they can't do.
[00:49:44.306 --> 00:49:48.728]  All I need is a butter knife I can sharpen in 20 minutes to go take all the guns I want.
[00:49:49.288 --> 00:49:51.289]  Because I've got the will to protect my family.
[00:49:53.249 --> 00:49:54.630]  You know what I can do with that butter knife?
[00:49:55.396 --> 00:49:57.117]  What you can do when you're protecting your family?
[00:49:57.317 --> 00:49:59.798]  Your body doesn't even turn on and give you power.
[00:50:00.138 --> 00:50:04.260]  All these wannabe tough guy men who think they're tough and got all the symbols of toughness.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.901]  The real power comes when you start defending people.
[00:50:07.141 --> 00:50:12.523]  The real power comes when you tap in to that primordial strength of defending your tribe.
[00:50:13.424 --> 00:50:17.305]  And that's why the good guys always kick the butts of the bad guys.
[00:50:18.546 --> 00:50:18.946]  That's why
[00:50:20.811 --> 00:50:23.516]  The New World Order tries to convince when it's doing evil things.
[00:50:23.576 --> 00:50:25.861]  It tries to hire and con and fool good guys.
[00:50:25.881 --> 00:50:28.225]  But good guys always start waking up real quick.
[00:50:31.491 --> 00:50:32.994]  So Rosie was told to shut up.
[00:50:34.637 --> 00:50:37.278]  And what does Hot Air and all the big neocon sites say?
[00:50:37.298 --> 00:50:38.238]  They all trumpet.
[00:50:38.259 --> 00:50:41.220]  Just type in Rosie Fired, Rosie Sacked, Rosie Canned into Google.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:44.801]  You'll get hundreds of articles as they celebrate and toast champagne.
[00:50:45.161 --> 00:50:46.282]  Oh, we got censorship!
[00:50:46.302 --> 00:50:46.942]  She's fired!
[00:50:47.042 --> 00:50:47.782]  Not even true!
[00:50:48.042 --> 00:50:49.303]  She walked away and said, you know what?
[00:50:49.443 --> 00:50:50.683]  You're not going to censor me anymore.
[00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:52.024]  I made your show a big hit.
[00:50:52.124 --> 00:50:52.624]  I'm leaving.
[00:50:53.525 --> 00:50:54.965]  Putting her money where her mouth is.
[00:50:55.605 --> 00:50:56.466]  Having courage.
[00:50:57.186 --> 00:50:58.367]  Saying no to corruption.
[00:50:58.487 --> 00:50:59.987]  Saying no to millions of dollars.
[00:51:00.748 --> 00:51:01.888]  Walking away from it.
[00:51:03.121 --> 00:51:03.901]  And what does she get?
[00:51:04.161 --> 00:51:05.962]  They even take what she did away from her.
[00:51:06.382 --> 00:51:08.162]  They take it and they twist it and they lie.
[00:51:08.362 --> 00:51:09.022]  The Pentagon.
[00:51:09.202 --> 00:51:10.183]  The Pentagon does.
[00:51:11.883 --> 00:51:16.264]  A Pentagon that the head of the Naval War College admits doesn't even work for America.
[00:51:16.604 --> 00:51:19.084]  It works for Wall Street and foreign banks.
[00:51:19.705 --> 00:51:22.325]  The Pentagon is here to destroy America.
[00:51:22.665 --> 00:51:23.585]  They are the enemy.
[00:51:23.825 --> 00:51:25.106]  They are the enemy combatants.
[00:51:25.546 --> 00:51:26.626]  I mean that when I say it.
[00:51:26.886 --> 00:51:28.707]  They are literally the enemy.
[00:51:29.747 --> 00:51:30.847]  This is not our government.
[00:51:38.077 --> 00:51:38.577]  It's here!
[00:51:38.777 --> 00:51:43.538]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:51:43.918 --> 00:51:51.541]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:52.256 --> 00:51:59.321]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:59.722 --> 00:52:11.130]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.973]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:52:15.413 --> 00:52:17.335]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:52:17.675 --> 00:52:21.518]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:36.391 --> 00:52:37.431]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:52:37.751 --> 00:52:40.533]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:52:40.813 --> 00:52:44.974]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:52:45.395 --> 00:52:46.215]  So what do you do?
[00:52:46.535 --> 00:52:51.097]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:52:51.597 --> 00:52:53.718]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:52:54.198 --> 00:53:08.901]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:53:08.941 --> 00:53:16.063]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:53:16.363 --> 00:53:19.524]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:53:34.662 --> 00:53:36.363]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:53:36.603 --> 00:53:40.306]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[00:53:40.626 --> 00:53:42.828]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[00:53:43.348 --> 00:53:49.552]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[00:53:49.713 --> 00:53:54.576]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door, because you left it unlocked.
[00:53:54.816 --> 00:54:03.841]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[00:54:04.162 --> 00:54:10.165]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[00:54:13.607 --> 00:54:16.710]  There's no software to load, and it's so easy to install.

[00:54:33.724 --> 00:54:38.909]  I don't need no education
[00:54:47.404 --> 00:55:08.333]  Yeah, they wrap themselves in the troops while they knowingly let them breathe the DU and give them experimental shots and keep them in their five tours.
[00:55:08.673 --> 00:55:09.594]  Never before been done.
[00:55:09.614 --> 00:55:12.755]  They always tell you how they love America while they're busy killing it.
[00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.870]  North American Union News coming up.
[00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:16.671]  So much other news on weather modification.
[00:55:16.991 --> 00:55:18.091]  It's all in the mainstream now.
[00:55:19.852 --> 00:55:23.813]  Your calls, I will be taking in the next hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:55:24.293 --> 00:55:26.333]  By the way, we do have William Rodriguez's video.
[00:55:26.373 --> 00:55:28.414]  William Rodriguez, What Really Happened on 9-11.
[00:55:28.814 --> 00:55:33.875]  Great DVD available for $14.95 at Infowars.com.
[00:55:33.935 --> 00:55:36.376]  Available at Infowars.com right now.
[00:55:38.024 --> 00:55:40.625]  And we're going to be getting that man back on the show here very, very soon.
[00:55:40.665 --> 00:55:42.105]  If he'll come on, I know he's very, very busy.
[00:55:42.145 --> 00:55:48.908]  But please get his film, because that does go to support him and his wife as they try to travel around the country for free, trying to get the word out.
[00:55:48.948 --> 00:55:55.390]  We appreciate him, by the way, giving us the exclusive, letting us know the behind-the-scenes stuff that also matched with our reports.
[00:55:55.970 --> 00:55:58.011]  We were getting from Christina Ebersole, a great lady.
[00:56:00.047 --> 00:56:04.970]  And again, bottom line, Rosie O'Donnell was not fired.
[00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:07.972]  Anytime you hear that, it is a giant, stinking lie.
[00:56:08.953 --> 00:56:12.855]  Now, one site that told the truth was the Neocon site to fire Rosie.
[00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:15.881]  No, no, we've been defeated.
[00:56:15.981 --> 00:56:22.286]  She actually left and now it looks like she's going to be getting a major TV show of her own and it wouldn't be the first time.
[00:56:23.607 --> 00:56:26.910]  She's still going to be a guest host and be able to say whatever she wants.
[00:56:27.570 --> 00:56:30.553]  ABC is saying how great she is and basically begging her to stay.
[00:56:31.553 --> 00:56:34.814]  The half owner, Barbara Walters, was begging her to stay on air.
[00:56:35.194 --> 00:56:36.875]  She wasn't fired, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:36.895 --> 00:56:37.755]  We've got to get that clip.
[00:56:38.095 --> 00:56:38.815]  We have it.
[00:56:38.835 --> 00:56:41.796]  We've got to put it on the story that Paul Watson is putting together.
[00:56:41.956 --> 00:56:44.457]  You've got the owner of the show saying, we don't want you to go.
[00:56:44.617 --> 00:56:48.498]  ABC owns half, Walters owns the other half.
[00:56:48.538 --> 00:56:51.859]  We've got the owner saying, we don't want you to go, and we're upset about it.
[00:56:51.959 --> 00:56:53.699]  Of course, because we're making a lot of money off of her.
[00:56:57.378 --> 00:57:00.440]  And then Fox News and all these other liars say she was fired!
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.621]  And Donald Trump says, we've got the clips!
[00:57:03.922 --> 00:57:04.942]  We'll play them in the next hour.
[00:57:06.783 --> 00:57:09.404]  What else have I not told the public that I can talk about?
[00:57:10.545 --> 00:57:15.168]  Well, it's just really that Rosie was censored the whole time.
[00:57:15.668 --> 00:57:17.789]  They were editing her when it was tape shows.
[00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:18.749]  They edited everything out.
[00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:25.093]  She'd say about 9-11 or dead troops or lying about the numbers of real troops that were dead.
[00:57:26.107 --> 00:57:31.288]  Or would she try to report how they don't count it a casualty if the person dies on a helicopter being flown out of Iraq?
[00:57:31.988 --> 00:57:36.049]  They wouldn't let her talk about how they make them pay for their own meals?
[00:57:36.089 --> 00:57:37.609]  Wouldn't let her talk about DU?
[00:57:37.989 --> 00:57:38.329]  Nothing!
[00:57:38.989 --> 00:57:39.329]  Nothing!
[00:57:39.409 --> 00:57:41.190]  She couldn't talk about the war.
[00:57:41.930 --> 00:57:42.590]  Well, of course not!
[00:57:42.610 --> 00:57:44.970]  The big defense contractor is basically on that channel.
[00:57:46.550 --> 00:57:47.711]  You think they want this to stop?
[00:57:48.011 --> 00:57:49.691]  By the way, you keep thinking they want to win the war.
[00:57:50.131 --> 00:57:51.331]  The government is winning the war.
[00:57:51.791 --> 00:57:53.872]  Okay, do you understand that the war is a success?
[00:57:54.312 --> 00:57:55.312]  I want to make that clear.
[00:57:56.098 --> 00:57:58.060]  But it isn't a success in the way you thought it was.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:13.534]  The longer, the more people die, the more platforms they sell, and the more no-bid contracts... You know, I was talking to Corey Rowe, one of the guys in loose change, one of the men that does that, a few days ago when I was with him.
[00:58:14.334 --> 00:58:16.456]  And, you know, I knew about it.
[00:58:16.476 --> 00:58:20.120]  And I said, you know, I remember reading in the Associated Press that you have to pay for your meals.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:21.481]  You basically ended up with nothing.
[00:58:22.188 --> 00:58:24.270]  And these are hardcore frontline combat troops.
[00:58:24.830 --> 00:58:25.971]  In Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:58:26.011 --> 00:58:26.892]  He was in both places.
[00:58:27.312 --> 00:58:28.373]  He was in big firefights.
[00:58:28.433 --> 00:58:29.294]  Killed a lot of people.
[00:58:29.314 --> 00:58:31.155]  He doesn't like to talk about it, but I've got him telling stories.
[00:58:31.936 --> 00:58:37.060]  And they've just, you know, he said that he talked about the Iraqis, that there'd be like a hundred of them in front of him, all shooting at him.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.142]  And they didn't know how to shoot, and they just mow them all down.
[00:58:39.962 --> 00:58:41.383]  But, uh, just amazing stories.
[00:58:41.443 --> 00:58:45.146]  But, I said, let me guess, he was driving out of there to pay for their food.
[00:58:45.667 --> 00:58:46.087]  All of it.
[00:58:47.168 --> 00:58:49.490]  And I said, also, is it true you had to pay like a hundred dollars?
[00:58:50.428 --> 00:58:55.752]  Uh, because they made you do dress inspections, but then you had to pay to have halibut and laundrette, and it was like super expensive.
[00:58:55.793 --> 00:58:57.394]  He goes, oh yeah, we had to pay for water.
[00:58:59.195 --> 00:59:00.837]  They've never done this to our troops, folks.
[00:59:00.877 --> 00:59:01.977]  They're raping them.
[00:59:02.558 --> 00:59:06.601]  They use them like toilet paper, and then tell them how much they care about them.
[00:59:08.102 --> 00:59:09.463]  This isn't our military.
[00:59:09.824 --> 00:59:11.265]  This isn't our government.

[00:59:29.121 --> 00:59:29.641]  are located?

[01:01:08.005 --> 01:01:08.986]  Here we are.
[01:01:09.006 --> 01:01:13.147]  I'm gonna get in a bunch of world news, local news, things happening here in the United States.
[01:01:14.053 --> 01:01:18.817]  Coming up, we're also going to have open phones, as I mentioned, at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:19.237 --> 01:01:22.900]  Finishing up with Rosie O'Donnell and the behind-the-scenes information I can now give you.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:28.604]  But finishing up with Corey Rowe, who was, right after 9-11, wanted to fight Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:29.465 --> 01:01:30.245]  Joined the Army.
[01:01:31.106 --> 01:01:32.567]  You know, a high school jock.
[01:01:33.428 --> 01:01:34.408]  Friends with Dylan Avery.
[01:01:34.989 --> 01:01:36.490]  He goes over to Afghanistan.
[01:01:36.510 --> 01:01:37.771]  He goes over to Iraq.
[01:01:37.811 --> 01:01:38.912]  He's there a couple years.
[01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:45.594]  And he was describing how they had to pay for their food, they still had to get in dress uniforms every few weeks, living out of their tanks, by the way.
[01:01:46.034 --> 01:01:48.416]  They didn't have cold weather gear, and it gets cold in Northern Iraq.
[01:01:48.696 --> 01:01:49.937]  They'd be freezing in their tanks.
[01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:55.201]  They'd have to, like, go and pay Halliburton to clean their uniforms to do dress inspections.
[01:01:55.301 --> 01:01:56.602]  They didn't do that in the past.
[01:01:58.083 --> 01:01:59.604]  And they, you know, breathing DU.
[01:01:59.864 --> 01:02:03.507]  By the way, Cory was talking about how he coughs his lungs up every day and, you know, vomits.
[01:02:03.527 --> 01:02:05.068]  I don't know if I'm supposed to talk about that.
[01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:06.189]  And he thinks it's DU.
[01:02:07.606 --> 01:02:09.807]  And, uh, all these other things that are happening.
[01:02:10.207 --> 01:02:11.768]  They give them all these experimental shots.
[01:02:11.828 --> 01:02:12.908]  These are people I know.
[01:02:12.928 --> 01:02:15.469]  By the way, that's the kind of people that are behind loose change.
[01:02:17.650 --> 01:02:21.011]  And... None of the troops are for it.
[01:02:21.031 --> 01:02:23.212]  I mean, there's like a handful, and they put them all up in the news.
[01:02:23.232 --> 01:02:24.052]  They all hate it.
[01:02:24.352 --> 01:02:25.333]  They know it's a fraud.
[01:02:25.353 --> 01:02:26.253]  They know it's a lie.
[01:02:26.273 --> 01:02:27.313]  They know it's a scam.
[01:02:27.854 --> 01:02:30.074]  The number is well over 12,000 dead U.S.
[01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:30.355]  troops.
[01:02:30.395 --> 01:02:31.235]  That's official numbers.
[01:02:31.255 --> 01:02:36.677]  But see, they don't count you as a combat casualty if you die in Rammstein or in London.
[01:02:38.802 --> 01:02:45.187]  Or if you die in the United States, you know, two weeks later, or an hour after you fly out of Iraq.
[01:02:46.869 --> 01:02:48.350]  That was 12,000 a few months ago.
[01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:49.391]  I don't know what it is now.
[01:02:49.451 --> 01:02:51.172]  It's not 3,000, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:51.252 --> 01:02:54.194]  It's over 12,000 dead.
[01:02:57.217 --> 01:03:02.141]  And of course, John Hopkins did their own study and found, yeah, the first three years, over 600,000 dead.
[01:03:02.201 --> 01:03:03.342]  They found 601, and the British said 654,000.
[01:03:08.462 --> 01:03:14.004]  Now with preliminary numbers coming in, it's well over a million dead.
[01:03:15.144 --> 01:03:17.265]  Really good job, New World Order.
[01:03:17.305 --> 01:03:18.145]  By the way, it was a good job.
[01:03:18.225 --> 01:03:20.006]  They did exactly what the Pentagon said.
[01:03:20.386 --> 01:03:32.930]  Break the country up, sectarian violence, bring it from First World to Third World, use it as a staging ground to invade and project power into Iran and Syria, turn off the oil supply to then create artificial scarcity and jack up prices.
[01:03:34.751 --> 01:03:35.431]  Total genius!
[01:03:36.337 --> 01:03:41.564]  You see, but the average person believes they're doing it for good reasons in this democracy and all this baloney.
[01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:45.308]  They don't understand how hardcore evil, these people are wreckers.
[01:03:45.429 --> 01:03:52.958]  And I've given this speech before, but I'd read about this a few places, but I got about six, seven years ago into naval history.
[01:03:53.118 --> 01:03:55.201]  I mean, I've been reading about Macedonian and
[01:03:56.471 --> 01:04:05.918]  The Greek Navy and I've been reading about the Silesians and the Romans and I got up to British because you know obviously I'm going to read about British naval history because it's in English and isn't a translation.
[01:04:06.439 --> 01:04:13.184]  I probably read 15, 20, it's kind of embarrassing, I probably read 30 or 40 the more I think about it, books on British naval history.
[01:04:14.204 --> 01:04:15.265]  You talk about action-packed.
[01:04:15.305 --> 01:04:19.428]  I mean, you know, each book might be a year of engagements and exact notes that were taken.
[01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:20.349]  It's mainly diaries.
[01:04:21.298 --> 01:04:28.363]  And descriptions of all the things, and you get to see through their eyes what the South Pacific looked like in 1720.
[01:04:28.663 --> 01:04:31.125]  It's just amazing.
[01:04:31.985 --> 01:04:32.806]  Why did I get off into that?
[01:04:32.906 --> 01:04:33.686]  Oh yeah, wreckers!
[01:04:34.447 --> 01:04:47.696]  All over the coast of France and Italy and England, there were little villages, little fishing towns that would cater to the merchants and to the pirates, which were basically the same thing, and the Navy.
[01:04:48.937 --> 01:04:50.658]  They put out fake lighthouses, though.
[01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:59.692]  Of course, the locals knew that it was fake to make people wreck there on these shoals so they could go out and rob their ships.
[01:05:00.453 --> 01:05:09.957]  And so they could go out and then basically, whatever gold the people escaped off the ship with and they survived, they'd have to pay for that just to get passage back to France or vice versa.
[01:05:10.238 --> 01:05:12.139]  They were called wreckers, wrecker towns.
[01:05:12.599 --> 01:05:14.039]  That's where the term wrecker comes from.
[01:05:15.792 --> 01:05:18.055]  Some of the most wealthy people in England made their money as wreckers.
[01:05:18.876 --> 01:05:21.038]  We literally have wreckers running things.
[01:05:21.619 --> 01:05:22.300]  That's all they do.
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:23.361]  They get us into a wreck.
[01:05:23.902 --> 01:05:25.944]  They make everything they can as bad as they can.
[01:05:26.024 --> 01:05:27.345]  New Orleans, 9-11, Iraq.
[01:05:32.737 --> 01:05:33.777]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.878]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:05:37.158 --> 01:05:41.300]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:42.560]  So what do you do?
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.442]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:47.942 --> 01:05:50.064]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:50.564 --> 01:06:05.255]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:12.360]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:17.106]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:06:17.567 --> 01:06:19.650]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.

[01:06:33.846 --> 01:06:39.268]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:06:39.649 --> 01:06:47.292]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:55.055]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:06:55.455 --> 01:07:06.862]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:07:07.182 --> 01:07:10.705]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:07:11.145 --> 01:07:13.066]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:07:13.406 --> 01:07:17.249]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:07:30.663 --> 01:07:34.947]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:07:35.187 --> 01:07:40.052]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:41.613]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:07:41.793 --> 01:07:45.156]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?

[01:08:31.737 --> 01:08:48.688]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:48.788 --> 01:08:51.770]  Richard, Rishi, Sue, Trent, Chris and others.
[01:08:52.842 --> 01:08:53.883]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:08:56.685 --> 01:08:58.546]  I said I'd play these clips, so let's just play them.
[01:08:58.866 --> 01:09:07.231]  Here's Rosie O'Donnell talking about why she's leaving The View, and being gracious to them that, you know, they just couldn't agree on a contract.
[01:09:07.271 --> 01:09:12.435]  But ABC and Art News articles admits that she didn't agree to three years and, you know, double the money, basically.
[01:09:12.455 --> 01:09:18.178]  And here's the owner of the show, owns half the show, Barbara Walters, saying, we're sad you're leaving.
[01:09:18.899 --> 01:09:22.161]  Yeah, they're sad millions of dollars is leaving is what they're sad about, tens of millions.
[01:09:23.167 --> 01:09:25.771]  And then Rosie quit.
[01:09:25.891 --> 01:09:27.233]  We know that she was planning to quit.
[01:09:27.713 --> 01:09:28.775]  I knew this three weeks ago.
[01:09:30.056 --> 01:09:36.925]  She wasn't going to renew her contract because she didn't want to be censored anymore and basically harassed by the producer and edited.
[01:09:37.845 --> 01:09:43.348]  I've decided that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC, so next year I'm not going to be on The View.
[01:10:03.346 --> 01:10:05.287]  I will be coming back and guest hosting.
[01:10:05.407 --> 01:10:07.128]  I'm just not gonna do the everyday thing.
[01:10:07.368 --> 01:10:10.230]  Cause we couldn't, you know, they wanted me three years, I wanted one year.
[01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:15.013]  And then they were like, okay, well what if we do the... I was like... And it just didn't work.
[01:10:15.433 --> 01:10:19.395]  Well, you keep saying don't be sad and we should all be upbeat and I am sad, okay?
[01:10:19.555 --> 01:10:20.456]  I'm sorry.
[01:10:20.516 --> 01:10:23.137]  Because I induced you to come here.
[01:10:23.157 --> 01:10:25.078]  I knew you were only coming for one year.
[01:10:25.438 --> 01:10:27.419]  I hoped that it would be more than one year.
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:30.401]  We have had to say the least, an interesting year.
[01:10:30.461 --> 01:10:31.762]  We certainly have!
[01:10:33.709 --> 01:10:34.871]  Okay, you heard Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:10:35.412 --> 01:10:36.774]  I made the decision to leave.
[01:10:36.854 --> 01:10:39.719]  Right there at the start, she says, I made the decision on the contract.
[01:10:39.999 --> 01:10:41.782]  I, I, I. She quit.
[01:10:41.822 --> 01:10:42.283]  Play it again.
[01:10:45.976 --> 01:10:51.278]  I've decided that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC, so next year I'm not going to be on The View.
[01:10:51.318 --> 01:10:53.259]  However... Okay, stop it.
[01:10:53.299 --> 01:10:54.899]  Play that one more time because the first got cut off.
[01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:56.060]  She says, I have decided.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:57.260]  I have decided.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:57.701]  Listen to it.
[01:10:58.261 --> 01:11:02.862]  I've decided that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC, so next year... Play it again.
[01:11:03.123 --> 01:11:14.607]  Because I want Fox News and the Pentagon, and I know you know the truth, but I want the Pentagon to know we know what Fox and CNN are, we know the Pentagon has been bought out and works for foreign corporations, and we understand you're here to destroy America.
[01:11:15.027 --> 01:11:15.828]  And destroy free speech.
[01:11:15.848 --> 01:11:16.608]  But you failed.
[01:11:16.828 --> 01:11:19.070]  We're going to get the word out on you and discredit you further.
[01:11:19.410 --> 01:11:23.152]  Here, again, as Rosie's saying, I have decided we couldn't work out the contract.
[01:11:23.853 --> 01:11:27.875]  I've decided that we couldn't come to terms with my deal with ABC.
[01:11:27.895 --> 01:11:40.483]  So next year I'm not going to... Now, let's play... Let's play the person who yells and screams and does profane things and does pro-wrestling.
[01:11:41.524 --> 01:11:42.104]  Donald Trump.
[01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:51.756]  And he brings up some comedian skit that Rosie did where, you know, she said something that's really sophomoric and is on daytime television.
[01:11:51.776 --> 01:11:56.319]  I'm not defending it, I'm not, you know, semi-vulgar like this, but this is Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:11:56.359 --> 01:12:04.585]  She is a loose cannon, that's why she's got courage, that's why she shot her mouth off, that's why she just turned down a bunch of money and a three-year contract with the number one TV show in morning television.
[01:12:05.405 --> 01:12:06.406]  That's why Rosie did it.
[01:12:07.307 --> 01:12:08.568]  Because she is a loose cannon.
[01:12:09.188 --> 01:12:12.110]  This is Donald Trump, as usual, lying about everything.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:19.092]  His reaction is you think he'd go off on another tantrum, but he was actually very respectful about this whole thing.
[01:12:19.132 --> 01:12:19.733]  Here's his reaction.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.161]  I've been predicting this for a long time.
[01:12:23.261 --> 01:12:25.561]  Rosie is a very self-destructive person.
[01:12:25.622 --> 01:12:27.002]  Rosie's basically a loser.
[01:12:27.642 --> 01:12:31.424]  I believe ABC wanted her out, and they wanted her out badly and fast.
[01:12:31.904 --> 01:12:40.527]  She made statements the other day at the Waldorf Astoria that were absolutely outrageous, where she grabbed her crotch and said things that were just terrible.
[01:12:40.967 --> 01:12:41.987]  I mean, she's a slob.
[01:12:42.107 --> 01:12:42.968]  Everybody knows it.
[01:12:43.028 --> 01:12:43.948]  And they wanted her out.
[01:12:44.248 --> 01:12:47.189]  And the one that wanted her out the most was Barbara Walters.
[01:12:53.153 --> 01:12:55.915]  So that's Jimmy Kimmel, and there you go.
[01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:56.735]  They wanted her out.
[01:12:56.795 --> 01:12:57.496]  She's fired.
[01:12:58.116 --> 01:13:02.700]  Fox News headline, Why ABC axed Rosie O'Donnell.
[01:13:05.242 --> 01:13:08.484]  Total, complete, lie.
[01:13:10.025 --> 01:13:11.646]  Because they can't have any more heroes.
[01:13:11.726 --> 01:13:14.368]  They can't have anybody who's got the will to turn down a bunch of money.
[01:13:14.589 --> 01:13:16.410]  They can't have people who won't be censored.
[01:13:17.037 --> 01:13:21.698]  So they've got to lie and say, yeah, she got fired for what she said.
[01:13:21.718 --> 01:13:22.818]  Ha ha, we win.
[01:13:23.258 --> 01:13:24.579]  No, you lost.
[01:13:24.699 --> 01:13:26.739]  You lost that battle too, New World Order.
[01:13:27.479 --> 01:13:32.960]  But you think you can just announce that all your cattle and all your sheeple will believe your Pentagon baloney.
[01:13:35.141 --> 01:13:36.061]  That doesn't work anymore.
[01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.942]  By the way, numbers just came out.
[01:13:40.982 --> 01:13:43.703]  In the last 10 years, newspaper circulation is down 67%.
[01:13:46.929 --> 01:13:48.790]  That's right, they like to always give you the number yearly.
[01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:52.492]  Like, we're down another 5%, we're down another 10%, we're down another 4%.
[01:13:53.212 --> 01:13:59.615]  Now it's down on a monthly basis, and the new numbers came out, it plunged even further than they thought, and there's total abject panic.
[01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:04.277]  It isn't just that people are using their iPods, you know, getting text messages of the news.
[01:14:04.577 --> 01:14:06.098]  It isn't just the Internet that's doing this.
[01:14:06.178 --> 01:14:07.378]  Okay, let me give you a news flash.
[01:14:08.639 --> 01:14:15.682]  When people have been polled, and people have been questioned, I mean, there was news 15 years ago, the American statesman here in Austin,
[01:14:16.804 --> 01:14:18.084]  Had plunging readership.
[01:14:18.164 --> 01:14:19.085]  It had already begun.
[01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:24.886]  Everybody I knew was saying, because we're tired of your lies.
[01:14:24.906 --> 01:14:25.886]  We're tired of your spin.
[01:14:25.926 --> 01:14:27.346]  We're tired of your propaganda.
[01:14:27.826 --> 01:14:31.847]  We're tired of your liberal propaganda, was the term at the time, but people have gotten more sophisticated now.
[01:14:31.927 --> 01:14:33.568]  It's establishment propaganda.
[01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:38.169]  And they had to put billboards up all over town for years saying, we're not your same old statesmen.
[01:14:38.569 --> 01:14:43.810]  And they tried for a while, trying to be pro-gun a little bit, and trying to be
[01:14:44.677 --> 01:14:45.758]  But they just couldn't do it.
[01:14:45.778 --> 01:14:46.998]  They couldn't help themselves.
[01:14:47.038 --> 01:14:49.640]  And so now, you know, that newspaper is a complete joke.
[01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:53.162]  I mean, literally, folks, we've put ads before in the Statesman.
[01:14:53.482 --> 01:14:56.584]  I mean, $400 ads for a little bitty thing in there.
[01:14:57.124 --> 01:14:58.445]  But, you know, a paragraph or two.
[01:14:59.205 --> 01:15:00.466]  And for one day.
[01:15:00.486 --> 01:15:05.249]  And we get one phone call by someone who can't even speak English, wanting a job.
[01:15:05.589 --> 01:15:10.031]  You put an ad on Craigslist for free, you get 300, 400 responses.
[01:15:11.352 --> 01:15:12.593]  They're beating down your door.
[01:15:13.374 --> 01:15:14.575]  You're a joke.
[01:15:15.035 --> 01:15:16.596]  You're a dinosaur.
[01:15:16.916 --> 01:15:18.477]  You're a legend in your own mind.
[01:15:19.258 --> 01:15:22.940]  PrisonPlanet.com is rated over 45,000 places higher.
[01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:26.697]  than Bill O'Reilly's website.
[01:15:27.177 --> 01:15:31.619]  My website is now tens of thousands of places ahead of Rush Limbaugh.
[01:15:31.939 --> 01:15:33.400]  I told you I was neck-and-neck last year.
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:35.181]  He's now ten... We ought to do a story on that.
[01:15:35.561 --> 01:15:41.284]  Tens of thousands of places behind, but still the general public that isn't tuned into reality doesn't even know who I am.
[01:15:41.544 --> 01:15:42.344]  Frankly, I don't even care.
[01:15:42.365 --> 01:15:47.167]  I almost hate telling people how big we've gotten, because then all sorts of weird ninnying and jealousy begins.
[01:15:47.807 --> 01:15:51.069]  Yes, it's like I'm a fighter aircraft deep behind enemy lines with
[01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:56.651]  All sorts of SAM missiles, literally hundreds of them, shooting at me.
[01:15:56.691 --> 01:15:57.712]  Yes, it's really wonderful.
[01:16:00.033 --> 01:16:00.673]  Again, I hate it.
[01:16:00.793 --> 01:16:03.554]  I want to be successful to fight the enemy, but I know it puts me in more danger.
[01:16:03.754 --> 01:16:04.654]  But I just go, you know what?
[01:16:04.674 --> 01:16:05.275]  I'm going to do it.
[01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:06.575]  Literally.
[01:16:07.495 --> 01:16:10.236]  I can't stand... Maybe ten years ago, I liked being known.
[01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.377]  Believe me, I hate it now.
[01:16:11.937 --> 01:16:13.078]  But I've got to get bigger.
[01:16:13.118 --> 01:16:14.238]  I've got to have a bigger effect.
[01:16:14.278 --> 01:16:15.358]  It's all about personality.
[01:16:15.378 --> 01:16:16.379]  It's all about information.
[01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:22.141]  And in a weird way, now I've got to stay really big, or they certainly will kill me or set me up.
[01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:25.089]  It's all these factors go into it.
[01:16:25.830 --> 01:16:26.850]  And then I just have to deal.
[01:16:26.911 --> 01:16:33.276]  It's like Alec Baldwin yesterday, who I know, by the way, well, hell, let's just say, Alec knows what's going on in the country.
[01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:38.581]  And he's always getting demonized, he's always getting attacked, he's always getting misquoted and lied about.
[01:16:38.601 --> 01:16:44.926]  And, you know, he goes, yeah, my teenage daughter was being rude to me and I called her a selfish little pig.
[01:16:46.047 --> 01:16:47.248]  Folks, I mean, don't lie to me.
[01:16:47.348 --> 01:16:48.249]  Oh, how dare him!
[01:16:48.289 --> 01:16:48.790]  How mean!
[01:16:50.273 --> 01:16:53.494]  You know, they call keeping track of your kids, or disciplining them, abuse.
[01:16:53.994 --> 01:17:01.236]  But then the government wants to have dogs sicced on them, and machine guns pointed at them, and cameras in the bathroom, but you're not supposed to watch what your children's doing.
[01:17:01.876 --> 01:17:05.777]  And you're not supposed to tell your child, when they're being a teenager, hey, stop acting like a pig.
[01:17:05.797 --> 01:17:11.739]  I think I remember my mother, when I was being like 14, and real rude to her.
[01:17:11.759 --> 01:17:13.139]  I think I remember her calling me a pig.
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.300]  You stop acting like a little pig.
[01:17:17.359 --> 01:17:19.240]  Oh my God, oh, he's so bad.
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:22.321]  I saw an AP article where he was quoted going, Big deal!
[01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:23.842]  I was mad at him not answering the phone.
[01:17:23.882 --> 01:17:26.623]  I told her, quit being a selfish little self-centered pig.
[01:17:26.643 --> 01:17:31.966]  Because by the way, his wife of course keeps her away from him and it just is frustrating.
[01:17:32.226 --> 01:17:34.347]  And then the teenagers play that off against their parents.
[01:17:35.467 --> 01:17:36.548]  You know how this stuff works.
[01:17:37.688 --> 01:17:38.989]  Why did I get off on Alec Baldwin?
[01:17:43.711 --> 01:17:46.032]  Well, my point is, I don't remember what I was going to say about him.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.981]  It's just that it was good to see him go, so what?
[01:17:49.682 --> 01:17:51.483]  Yeah, I called her a selfish little pig.
[01:17:54.064 --> 01:17:54.945]  But you're not supposed to do that.
[01:17:54.965 --> 01:17:58.647]  You're supposed to just hand them over to the state so the SWAT team can slam their head into the concrete.
[01:17:58.667 --> 01:18:02.929]  It's all about not training your children so they're a bunch of animals so they get caught in the system.
[01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:09.733]  And then you do anything to discipline your children and they take them from you so they can be five times more likely to be abused.
[01:18:10.033 --> 01:18:11.834]  Justice Department's own numbers and their system.
[01:18:15.478 --> 01:18:16.379]  You know, I said I'd go to your calls.
[01:18:16.399 --> 01:18:17.840]  I might just go for three hours.
[01:18:20.682 --> 01:18:21.463]  I'll go to your calls.
[01:18:21.503 --> 01:18:22.103]  I want to hear from you.
[01:18:22.143 --> 01:18:24.085]  I just... I've got so much I want to talk about.
[01:18:24.105 --> 01:18:26.387]  We're going to come back and go to calls for the rest of the hour.
[01:18:26.467 --> 01:18:27.287]  Forty minutes of calls.
[01:18:27.347 --> 01:18:30.870]  And then I'm going to continue into the third hour with nothing but news, I think.
[01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:31.711]  Or maybe some calls.
[01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:32.111]  I don't know.
[01:18:33.812 --> 01:18:34.613]  I've got it all here.
[01:18:35.173 --> 01:18:38.816]  I've got Pentagon wants to end controversial spying program in America.
[01:18:39.437 --> 01:18:43.000]  And then I want to just point you to where they announce they're lying to you domestically.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:44.541]  That is a total lie.
[01:18:45.525 --> 01:18:47.607]  The phone companies are the NSA.
[01:18:47.647 --> 01:18:49.008]  Whole floors in every facility.
[01:18:49.248 --> 01:18:50.490]  How many years did I tell you that?
[01:18:50.530 --> 01:18:57.255]  Then it came out with one office for the whole state of California and San Francisco AT&T.
[01:18:57.676 --> 01:18:59.617]  Where the whole floor was a spook base.
[01:19:01.078 --> 01:19:02.059]  Now it's been all over the news.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:05.382]  If I tell you something, we've got it backed up.
[01:19:07.144 --> 01:19:08.104]  So they're lying.
[01:19:08.164 --> 01:19:10.727]  Pentagon wants to end controversial spying program.
[01:19:11.807 --> 01:19:12.468]  Here's another one.
[01:19:12.708 --> 01:19:12.848]  U.S.
[01:19:12.888 --> 01:19:13.349]  officials
[01:19:14.116 --> 01:19:16.978]  Exclude car bombs and touting dropping Iraq violence.
[01:19:17.718 --> 01:19:19.159]  This is McClatchy Newspapers.
[01:19:19.219 --> 01:19:20.860]  You cannot make this type of lying up.
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:22.121]  I mean, these people are sick.
[01:19:24.022 --> 01:19:29.405]  And if you believe this, you believe the Tooth Fairy is real and brings you $10 when your tooth falls out.
[01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:34.547]  Reuters, Bin Laden overseeing Iraq-Afghanistan ops and the Taliban.
[01:19:35.188 --> 01:19:35.888]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:19:36.148 --> 01:19:42.612]  And the last guy they tortured at Gitmo for four years, he really did kill Kennedy.
[01:19:43.955 --> 01:19:45.196]  He actually is the tooth fairy.
[01:19:45.336 --> 01:19:52.418]  He actually flaps into your window at night and puts it under your bed.
[01:19:52.438 --> 01:19:55.439]  So we're going to go over that.
[01:19:55.459 --> 01:19:58.960]  We're going to play Keith Olbermann on Giuliani's terror of fear mongering.
[01:20:01.001 --> 01:20:02.341]  This is the Wall Street Journal.
[01:20:02.361 --> 01:20:05.463]  I know I'm a kook when I have the father of weather weapons on and it's not true.
[01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:10.084]  Could global warming be halted by controlling the weather?
[01:20:11.685 --> 01:20:12.445]  And then China.
[01:20:13.231 --> 01:20:14.773]  To force rain ahead of Olympics.
[01:20:16.474 --> 01:20:20.238]  Industry caught in carbon smoke screen with the global carbon tax.
[01:20:20.518 --> 01:20:21.539]  We told you that was a fraud.
[01:20:21.559 --> 01:20:22.880]  This is Financial Times of London.
[01:20:23.481 --> 01:20:27.064]  There's going to be a town in China run by women where the men are beaten.
[01:20:27.084 --> 01:20:28.085]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:33.266 --> 01:20:37.768]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:38.128 --> 01:20:42.210]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:43.050]  We listened.
[01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:48.352]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:48.612 --> 01:20:49.112]  We listened.
[01:20:49.492 --> 01:20:52.514]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:52.954 --> 01:20:53.494]  We listened.
[01:20:53.954 --> 01:20:55.975]  You asked us to include an emergency light for
[01:20:59.218 --> 01:21:04.463]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:21:04.863 --> 01:21:06.244]  Again, we listened.
[01:21:06.585 --> 01:21:13.912]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:21:14.372 --> 01:21:17.013]  Get the Berkey Light at the American Water Purifier.
[01:21:17.213 --> 01:21:17.413]  Only $279.
[01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:18.613]  Call New Millennium 888-03-4438.
[01:21:18.633 --> 01:21:18.933]  That's 888-03-4438.

[01:21:22.694 --> 01:21:24.974]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[01:21:37.432 --> 01:21:42.255]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[01:21:42.456 --> 01:21:45.197]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[01:21:45.258 --> 01:21:46.358]  dollar can be devalued.
[01:21:47.699 --> 01:21:52.302]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[01:21:53.223 --> 01:22:00.488]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[01:22:01.489 --> 01:22:04.551]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[01:22:06.698 --> 01:22:10.142]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.

[01:22:22.474 --> 01:22:22.775]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:22.795 --> 01:22:23.035]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:30.894 --> 01:22:32.655]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:22:32.755 --> 01:22:34.016]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:22:34.256 --> 01:22:37.078]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:37.438 --> 01:22:40.200]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[01:22:40.741 --> 01:22:47.485]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:23:30.948 --> 01:23:33.509]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:23:34.090 --> 01:23:39.172]  Did you know that the United Nations has never settled disputes, but always makes them worse?
[01:23:40.033 --> 01:23:43.975]  Our own ambassador to the United Nations in 1982 admitted such.
[01:23:44.575 --> 01:23:52.920]  Did you know that the United Nations ignores communist atrocities, but always targets non-communist nations and their leaders for overthrow?
[01:23:53.982 --> 01:24:04.433]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:24:24.409 --> 01:24:24.969]  Call now.
[01:24:25.169 --> 01:24:28.092]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:24:37.128 --> 01:24:39.710]  Every morning at the mine you could see him arrive.
[01:24:39.730 --> 01:24:42.072]  He stood six foot six and weighed 245.
[01:24:42.152 --> 01:24:45.154]  Kind of broad at the shoulder and narrow at the hip.
[01:24:45.215 --> 01:24:48.937]  And everybody knew he didn't give no lift to the Big John.
[01:24:50.559 --> 01:24:51.680]  Big John!
[01:24:53.341 --> 01:24:55.643]  Big John!
[01:24:56.163 --> 01:24:58.565]  Big Bad John!
[01:24:59.045 --> 01:25:00.086]  Big John!
[01:25:02.213 --> 01:25:07.575]  Nobody seemed to know where John called home, he just drifted into town and stayed all alone.
[01:25:07.595 --> 01:25:13.997]  Didn't say much, kinda quiet and shy, but he spoke it all, he just said hi to Big John.
[01:25:16.118 --> 01:25:27.823]  Somebody said he came from New Orleans, where he got in a fight over a Cajun queen and a crashing blow from a huge right hand sent a Louisiana fella to the promised land, Big John.
[01:25:29.671 --> 01:25:40.275]  Big John, Big John, Big Bad John, Big John.
[01:25:41.295 --> 01:25:47.097]  Then came the day at the bottom of the mine when the timber cracked and men started crying.
[01:25:47.177 --> 01:25:49.578]  Miners were praying and hearts beat fast.
[01:25:49.658 --> 01:25:52.859]  Everybody thought that they'd breathed their last except John.
[01:25:55.046 --> 01:26:06.711]  Through the dust and the smoke of this man-made hell Walked a giant of a man that the miners knew well Grabbed a sagging timber, gave out with a groan And like a giant old tree just stood there along Big John
[01:26:08.562 --> 01:26:09.623]  Big John!
[01:26:11.365 --> 01:26:12.426]  Big John!
[01:26:14.128 --> 01:26:16.530]  Big Bad John!
[01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:19.373]  Big John!
[01:26:20.334 --> 01:26:31.685]  With all his strength he gave a mighty shove Then a miner yelled out, there's a light up above And twenty men scrambled from a would-be grave Now there's only one left down there to save Big John!
[01:26:34.002 --> 01:26:56.917]  With jacks and timbers they started back down Then came that rumble way down on the ground And the smoke and gas fell straight out of that mine Everybody knew it was the end of the line for Big John Big John Big John Big Bad John Big John
[01:26:59.022 --> 01:27:01.563]  Now, they never reopened that worthless pit.
[01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:04.643]  They just placed a marble stand in front of it.
[01:27:04.703 --> 01:27:12.705]  These few words written on that stand... At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man.
[01:27:13.826 --> 01:27:17.847]  Big John.
[01:27:18.627 --> 01:27:24.768]  Big bad John.
[01:27:25.049 --> 01:27:26.649]  Alright, I played the whole song.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:30.742]  People have been asking me, why do I play North to Alaska and that song and a few others.
[01:27:30.782 --> 01:27:33.384]  Because when I was a little kid, my dad bought me this little record player.
[01:27:33.404 --> 01:27:35.446]  I don't know, they were the little records.
[01:27:35.466 --> 01:27:36.466]  I forget what you called those.
[01:27:36.787 --> 01:27:42.551]  And I guess it went with a bunch of old records he had from when he was a kid or something.
[01:27:42.571 --> 01:27:43.972]  And it was stuff like that.
[01:27:44.012 --> 01:27:45.533]  In 1814, took a little trip.
[01:27:45.553 --> 01:27:47.234]  Along with Colonel Jackson.
[01:27:47.935 --> 01:27:49.776]  My God, I played that song a few months ago.
[01:27:49.856 --> 01:27:52.818]  And locals thought it was secret codes or something.
[01:27:52.838 --> 01:27:55.280]  I mean, that's why I get so sick of doing what I do.
[01:27:57.228 --> 01:27:58.649]  It's just so crazy, man.
[01:27:58.669 --> 01:28:03.371]  That's why I was talking about Alec Baldwin.
[01:28:03.391 --> 01:28:06.292]  He was like, I want to get out of acting.
[01:28:07.193 --> 01:28:09.754]  I just don't want to interface with the stupid public anymore.
[01:28:09.794 --> 01:28:12.015]  I don't even want to be involved with all this anymore.
[01:28:12.475 --> 01:28:13.836]  He was telling the Associated Press that.
[01:28:14.296 --> 01:28:19.639]  And I know he means it, because you really do get sick of it.
[01:28:19.939 --> 01:28:21.700]  Because people think that
[01:28:22.941 --> 01:28:23.941]  And I guess this is the trap.
[01:28:24.022 --> 01:28:29.964]  I guess you do want people to know who you are, and you do want to be a big shot until you are, and then you find out it's not fun.
[01:28:30.544 --> 01:28:31.645]  Now, that's normal people.
[01:28:32.805 --> 01:28:43.690]  There are a lot of people who, like Bush and his controllers and all these... I mean, there's never enough power.
[01:28:45.231 --> 01:28:51.854]  I guarantee you, if Hitler would have taken over the world, he would have started trying to build spaceships and go conquer Mars in case there were any green little men there.
[01:28:52.896 --> 01:29:01.943]  But really, what they do when Stalin had total power over Russia, he tried to take over surrounding countries, and when he had total domination of his own country, he started having massive purges and killing people, because he can.
[01:29:02.484 --> 01:29:03.805]  It is what it is, as they say.
[01:29:05.386 --> 01:29:06.787]  And I just never get those people.
[01:29:07.068 --> 01:29:15.374]  My dad told me, when I was decades ago, I remember him saying, well, you know, to get really powerful, son, you've got to make a lot of compromises and do a lot of really bad things.
[01:29:15.394 --> 01:29:19.738]  That's why most successful people just get to a certain level of success, because you get fat and happy.
[01:29:20.638 --> 01:29:26.463]  Then you're not willing to go scrabble and fight and scrap for, you know, just so competitive.
[01:29:26.483 --> 01:29:29.025]  It's like a hyper-sickness of competitiveness.
[01:29:29.885 --> 01:29:31.867]  These people are pure machines, man.
[01:29:31.927 --> 01:29:32.648]  They don't care.
[01:29:32.668 --> 01:29:36.331]  They don't care how many, you know, there's oil there, kill that whole village.
[01:29:37.311 --> 01:29:38.793]  Just kill a thousand of them.
[01:29:38.833 --> 01:29:41.094]  Send in troops, line them up and blow their heads off.
[01:29:41.855 --> 01:29:43.316]  These guys sleep good at night.
[01:29:43.376 --> 01:29:44.437]  They just, they love it.
[01:29:45.378 --> 01:29:48.040]  And you think they care about you, America.
[01:29:48.743 --> 01:29:51.804]  You think they give one red cent for all of us put together?
[01:29:52.724 --> 01:29:54.385]  Alright, I promise when we get back we'll go to your calls.
[01:29:55.745 --> 01:30:05.769]  I am, uh... I am, uh... I just want to beat the New World Order.
[01:30:05.789 --> 01:30:07.950]  I just want to live in some semblance of security.
[01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:10.511]  I just don't want total criminals running things.
[01:30:11.271 --> 01:30:14.532]  I mean, hell, I... This isn't boss hog corruption.
[01:30:14.572 --> 01:30:16.433]  This is hardcore evil.
[01:30:16.993 --> 01:30:17.573]  We'll be right back.
[01:30:21.548 --> 01:30:24.537]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:30:24.557 --> 01:30:28.188]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:31.403 --> 01:30:38.167]  Craig Walcott, chartered financial consultant and host of the Dead Doctors Don't Lie radio program and million-dollar earner in the network marketing field since 1989.
[01:30:38.547 --> 01:30:40.648]  I certainly know what it takes to succeed.
[01:30:40.908 --> 01:30:46.331]  I also know without proper tools, your chance for significant income in the network marketing field can quickly fade.
[01:30:46.551 --> 01:30:52.474]  The sad truth is that 99% of the people who enter network marketing will never spend the time nor money to develop the skills they need.
[01:30:52.734 --> 01:30:55.156]  That's where MLM Incorporated steps in.
[01:30:55.356 --> 01:31:02.180]  No matter what network marketing venture you're involved in, MLM Incorporated can provide you the successful tools you need to truly succeed.
[01:31:02.480 --> 01:31:12.066]  A subscription to MLM Incorporated will provide you access to the three-hour industrial revolution of network marketing seminar where you will learn to perform at a level you never thought possible.
[01:31:12.246 --> 01:31:15.628]  Radio, TV, Internet, direct mail will all be at your fingertips.
[01:31:15.788 --> 01:31:16.268]  We're good to go.
[01:31:32.105 --> 01:31:35.868]  Do you need more than just the constant news of impending tyranny?
[01:31:36.249 --> 01:31:43.515]  Yes, this is Elizabeth Porter, back with The Divided Kingdom, the hour that analyzes spiritual and cultural issues, too.
[01:31:43.535 --> 01:31:54.985]  Lou Blanchard and I are delighted, thanks in large part to past listeners' lobbying efforts, now to be on the great Genesis Communications Network Monday through Friday at 6 p.m.
[01:31:55.045 --> 01:31:55.265]  Central.
[01:31:58.008 --> 01:32:01.471]  This is the network often imitated, but never duplicated.
[01:32:01.791 --> 01:32:07.697]  Lou and I made the conscious decision to move to GCN because of its classy lineup and leadership.
[01:32:08.177 --> 01:32:12.922]  We invite you to hear our program, one we pray will strengthen and bless you.
[01:32:13.322 --> 01:32:18.107]  Indeed, trouble is part of the story, but the fellowship of faith surpasses it.
[01:32:18.547 --> 01:32:19.848]  Tune in at 6 p.m.
[01:32:19.928 --> 01:32:20.289]  Central.
[01:32:20.909 --> 01:32:29.151]  Also, be sure to visit our Tuesday guest host, Dr. Carl Sanders' website, TrumpetMen.org.
[01:32:31.132 --> 01:32:34.732]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:32:34.972 --> 01:32:35.833]  Look no further!
[01:32:36.133 --> 01:32:38.693]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:32:39.133 --> 01:32:47.636]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:32:47.796 --> 01:32:49.476]  You can order everything you need on the web
[01:32:49.796 --> 01:32:50.377]  We're good to go.
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:19.881]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[01:33:19.901 --> 01:33:21.281]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[01:33:21.301 --> 01:33:23.362]  Even your emotions have an echo in so much space.
[01:33:52.659 --> 01:34:03.901]  Yeah, I was out of touch But it wasn't because I didn't know enough I just knew too much Does that make me crazy?
[01:34:04.061 --> 01:34:06.041]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:34:06.502 --> 01:34:08.682]  Does that make me crazy?
[01:34:32.989 --> 01:34:34.131]  Well, drink wine!
[01:34:55.616 --> 01:34:57.977]  Well, I think you're crazy!
[01:34:58.097 --> 01:35:02.519]  I think you're crazy!
[01:35:02.699 --> 01:35:07.382]  I think you're crazy!
[01:35:07.402 --> 01:35:17.226]  Just like me!
[01:35:17.326 --> 01:35:20.968]  My hero has a heart to the lies I only
[01:35:24.464 --> 01:35:29.489]  And all I remember is thinking I want to be like them
[01:35:44.901 --> 01:35:45.141]  Oh, yeah.
[01:35:45.161 --> 01:35:45.221]  Mmm.
[01:35:45.241 --> 01:35:45.741]  I can feel it.
[01:36:16.551 --> 01:36:18.152]  Welcome back, alright, to your calls.
[01:36:18.212 --> 01:36:22.915]  I'll just say this, though, that my heroes have always lived life out on a limb.
[01:36:23.356 --> 01:36:26.798]  And I remember thinking, I'm gonna be like them.
[01:36:26.818 --> 01:36:31.581]  And that's what it all comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:36:32.161 --> 01:36:36.804]  That, uh... Alright, let's just go to your calls here.
[01:36:37.885 --> 01:36:39.726]  Where is that stupid call list here?
[01:36:41.568 --> 01:36:42.528]  Stacks of articles.
[01:36:43.169 --> 01:36:45.090]  Richard in Texas, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:36:45.888 --> 01:36:46.508]  Hello, Alex.
[01:36:46.668 --> 01:36:54.751]  I just wanted to comment on what you were saying a minute ago about the increasing use of power by these megalomaniacs.
[01:36:55.191 --> 01:37:08.896]  It also seems to me that there's a sort of a fear thing at work there in which these guys have got to figure if they don't continue to expand their control, their power, and raise the level of fear that they'll actually go backwards and risk being exposed.
[01:37:09.296 --> 01:37:10.877]  And of course the opposite is happening.
[01:37:10.897 --> 01:37:11.957]  The opposite is happening.
[01:37:11.998 --> 01:37:20.062]  It's actually making everybody get mad, which then makes them accelerated, and they're going towards a collision like two locomotives going 100 miles an hour apiece.
[01:37:20.682 --> 01:37:21.362]  Yep.
[01:37:21.482 --> 01:37:23.123]  Two quick things I wanted to mention.
[01:37:23.163 --> 01:37:30.427]  Last night there was an excellent thing on Countdown, Keith Olbermann's show, where he just absolutely ripped Giuliani on his 9-11 hero stuff.
[01:37:33.492 --> 01:37:40.714]  Also, a rip in the President, effectively, as being elevated to heroes for such failures, you know, of preventing the attack.
[01:37:41.614 --> 01:37:42.995]  And that was pretty interesting.
[01:37:43.035 --> 01:37:57.999]  I'm also curious, after Bill Moyers' show last night, where he laid out all of the, you know, manipulation of media and the lies leading up to the Iraq War, I know Bill Moyers is somewhat compromised, obviously, by his involvement with
[01:37:58.639 --> 01:38:00.120]  Sure, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[01:38:00.180 --> 01:38:03.662]  I guarantee you that both the individuals you mentioned are all about 9-11.
[01:38:03.722 --> 01:38:05.383]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:38:26.555 --> 01:38:28.903]  Also, I was out in LA, got in late Sunday night.
[01:38:29.345 --> 01:38:32.416]  Or not late Sunday night, Sunday afternoon, but late Sunday night I was watching...
[01:38:35.617 --> 01:38:36.838]  Some new PBS special.
[01:38:36.998 --> 01:38:37.758]  I forget the name.
[01:38:37.838 --> 01:38:42.079]  It's like a big series on surveillance in the police state.
[01:38:42.099 --> 01:38:43.339]  And I thought this would be a whitewash.
[01:38:43.799 --> 01:38:47.420]  They were admitting the whole floors of all the phone companies that were surveilling everything.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:49.481]  They were admitting that everything's being listened to.
[01:38:49.541 --> 01:38:50.541]  It's a total grid.
[01:38:51.041 --> 01:38:59.603]  They were admitting, and then the next part in the series is supposedly going to be about media propaganda.
[01:38:59.623 --> 01:39:01.243]  So yeah, you must be talking about the same thing.
[01:39:05.365 --> 01:39:06.126]  So, yes.
[01:39:06.926 --> 01:39:08.147]  Look, this is how it works.
[01:39:09.388 --> 01:39:20.136]  You've got maybe 2% of people in high-level media that are actual Defense Department, CIA, or a lot of times actual contractors from Lockheed Martin or General Electric who are there.
[01:39:20.156 --> 01:39:22.338]  I mean, they're above government agents.
[01:39:22.378 --> 01:39:24.039]  They're actual corporate controllers.
[01:39:24.059 --> 01:39:25.180]  They're all CFR members.
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.582]  And again, even most CFR members aren't in the inner circle, even though it's going on.
[01:39:29.723 --> 01:39:31.585]  That's got several concentric layers to it.
[01:39:33.346 --> 01:39:34.487]  And they have an agenda.
[01:39:35.957 --> 01:39:42.322]  And everything's about what's good for the agenda and the interlocking interest of this global elite.
[01:39:44.043 --> 01:40:00.394]  But, yeah, I mean, most people, powerful people in government, in media, in banking, a lot of them who aren't in the absolute A-list league, but who you would think of as, you know, absolute ultra-rich, people worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:40:01.275 --> 01:40:02.336]  Are totally freaked out.
[01:40:02.376 --> 01:40:03.897]  They're buying islands out of the country.
[01:40:04.458 --> 01:40:05.358]  They hate what's happening.
[01:40:05.378 --> 01:40:09.021]  They're quietly giving money to groups they think are fighting the New World Order.
[01:40:09.041 --> 01:40:16.387]  I mean, it's not everybody in the elite that likes this, okay?
[01:40:17.547 --> 01:40:22.831]  But it's only the most wicked, most powerful that are in the seats of power, and they're driving the agenda.
[01:40:23.712 --> 01:40:26.474]  And then all these other people who know what's going on have been afraid to speak up.
[01:40:26.874 --> 01:40:28.856]  That's why it's important for us to hit the barbed wire.
[01:40:29.244 --> 01:40:32.827]  That's why when Charlie Sheen hit it first, at his level, it was a big deal.
[01:40:32.847 --> 01:40:46.397]  I mean, he hit the barbed wire, and then Ebersole and so many others, Rosie O'Donnell, there's been a bunch of others, James Brolin, they climbed up over his back.
[01:40:47.197 --> 01:40:48.579]  And now more people are doing that.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:55.864]  And you've got to respect trailblazing, and I mean, I respect trailblazing when it's evil trailblazing.
[01:40:55.924 --> 01:40:58.486]  I don't like it, I don't agree with it, but I respect it.
[01:40:59.375 --> 01:41:14.783]  Well, I absolutely love and respect and just give all the adulation I can and all the support I can to people that trailblaze for good at great personal sacrifice and demonization in the media.
[01:41:15.743 --> 01:41:22.347]  I mean, I was talking to David Lynch, and I was like, you agreed to come on here, Mr. Lynch, to talk about 9-11 a few months ago.
[01:41:22.747 --> 01:41:28.350]  We told you up front what the interview was, and he said, yeah, but
[01:41:28.914 --> 01:41:31.756]  You know, basically, I'm afraid of what... I shouldn't say basically.
[01:41:31.776 --> 01:41:32.836]  He said, listen, I'm afraid.
[01:41:33.217 --> 01:41:34.478]  Look what they did to Charlie Sheen.
[01:41:35.058 --> 01:41:36.339]  They put him through a wringer.
[01:41:36.399 --> 01:41:38.220]  You know, they smeared him, was the exact words.
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:45.384]  And just, you know, what... He kind of just fell back into the mantra of, we've just got to change ourselves individually.
[01:41:45.785 --> 01:41:51.128]  Yeah, but we've also got to change ourselves individually, but also then put that into action in the world around us.
[01:41:51.528 --> 01:41:54.490]  Faith Without Works, my brother, is absolutely dead.
[01:41:56.855 --> 01:41:59.516]  And I'm not getting into a Catholic-Protestant argument here.
[01:41:59.556 --> 01:42:00.497]  I'm non-denominational.
[01:42:00.517 --> 01:42:02.998]  The point is they always make it some type of factionalized.
[01:42:03.938 --> 01:42:10.282]  The point is, is that yes, you get the faith first to do the right thing, but then you don't have the faith if you're not doing the works.
[01:42:10.702 --> 01:42:12.122]  The works do come after the faith.
[01:42:12.182 --> 01:42:13.223]  It is saved by grace.
[01:42:13.643 --> 01:42:16.064]  But then if you're not doing the works, man, you're not saved.
[01:42:16.484 --> 01:42:17.305]  Do you understand that?
[01:42:17.825 --> 01:42:21.407]  You're not a duck if you're not quacking and got little feet and paddle around in the pond.
[01:42:22.127 --> 01:42:22.467]  Okay?
[01:42:22.908 --> 01:42:23.608]  You got a little beak.
[01:42:24.562 --> 01:42:25.343]  You know, quack quack.
[01:42:25.923 --> 01:42:26.824]  You claim you're a duck.
[01:42:26.844 --> 01:42:27.524]  You're not a duck.
[01:42:29.145 --> 01:42:30.506]  I mean, I can't control myself.
[01:42:30.566 --> 01:42:31.386]  I want to fight evil.
[01:42:32.227 --> 01:42:33.928]  There's no ifs, ands, or buts about this.
[01:42:33.988 --> 01:42:38.791]  And I don't understand how the rest of you aren't completely focused like laser beams on this.
[01:42:38.811 --> 01:42:41.693]  You know, here's an example.
[01:42:41.713 --> 01:42:46.736]  The loose change crew calls up six, seven, eight months ago and says, we want to use your footage.
[01:42:46.776 --> 01:42:47.817]  I go, use anything you want.
[01:42:47.857 --> 01:42:48.437]  It's all free.
[01:42:48.698 --> 01:42:49.578]  They go, you don't want money?
[01:42:49.618 --> 01:42:50.459]  Everybody else has for money.
[01:42:50.479 --> 01:42:51.279]  I go, no, just use it.
[01:42:53.601 --> 01:42:53.901]  You see?
[01:42:54.733 --> 01:42:58.016]  But then you try to get some nickel-and-dime locals to let you put something out.
[01:42:58.056 --> 01:43:02.961]  They'll freak out and blame you for everything in the book, and then you want some type of fame or something.
[01:43:03.622 --> 01:43:06.445]  I mean, this is the way people operate.
[01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:08.727]  You see, this is how you reap what you sow.
[01:43:09.828 --> 01:43:12.531]  You see, I literally didn't care and said, use whatever you want.
[01:43:12.711 --> 01:43:13.512]  Use whatever you want.
[01:43:13.992 --> 01:43:14.653]  Please use it.
[01:43:15.245 --> 01:43:16.065]  In your final cut.
[01:43:16.326 --> 01:43:18.627]  And then later they come back to me and want me to be a consultant.
[01:43:18.907 --> 01:43:21.388]  And they come back to me and want me to work with them and be involved.
[01:43:21.428 --> 01:43:22.348]  And they're my friends.
[01:43:22.608 --> 01:43:23.369]  And they're real people.
[01:43:23.389 --> 01:43:25.149]  They're not a bunch of backstabbing scum.
[01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:27.410]  Neither is Luke Radowsky and people like that.
[01:43:27.851 --> 01:43:29.531]  You see, because they're doing it for the right reasons.
[01:43:31.772 --> 01:43:36.535]  All they do is fly around for free around the country until they're broke and giving out hundreds of thousands of free DVDs.
[01:43:36.575 --> 01:43:38.055]  Believe me, I know behind the scenes.
[01:43:38.095 --> 01:43:40.016]  And we're doing some stuff together I'm not going to tell you about until later.
[01:43:42.157 --> 01:43:44.098]  See, that's how that works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:43:45.436 --> 01:43:46.657]  You reap what you sow.
[01:43:46.677 --> 01:43:47.837]  Do you understand that?
[01:43:47.857 --> 01:43:49.238]  I'm putting it all in God's hands.
[01:43:49.538 --> 01:43:50.738]  It's all in God's hands.
[01:43:51.498 --> 01:43:57.621]  We could turn the New World Order over tomorrow if you'd stop being a bunch of self-serving, self-centered scum.
[01:43:59.302 --> 01:44:03.163]  And you're damn right, excuse my French, excuse me, but I'm just being myself these days.
[01:44:03.543 --> 01:44:06.144]  You're absolutely right, I don't like people like that.
[01:44:06.184 --> 01:44:09.266]  You're absolutely right, I'll get on the telephone and tell you you're a bunch of idiots.
[01:44:10.046 --> 01:44:12.767]  Because I'm seriously on the front lines here.
[01:44:13.741 --> 01:44:19.003]  I literally, you know, very rarely, but sometimes I get so much anxiety over this stuff, I go throw up.
[01:44:22.564 --> 01:44:23.424]  This is real!
[01:44:23.765 --> 01:44:24.765]  This isn't a game!
[01:44:25.405 --> 01:44:26.806]  I'm the one that started this!
[01:44:27.126 --> 01:44:30.467]  And I don't ask for anything, but maybe a little bit of respect.
[01:44:30.647 --> 01:44:31.647]  Just a little bit!
[01:44:33.488 --> 01:44:33.948]  But you know what?
[01:44:33.968 --> 01:44:34.668]  I don't expect that.
[01:44:34.788 --> 01:44:36.049]  I'm doing what I'm doing for my family.
[01:44:36.209 --> 01:44:37.829]  So I don't care about all the scum out there.
[01:44:38.290 --> 01:44:39.370]  Just get out of my way!
[01:44:42.591 --> 01:44:43.752]  Just get out of my way!
[01:44:49.118 --> 01:44:49.659]  All of it!
[01:44:53.863 --> 01:44:54.944]  Alright, I said I'd go to calls.
[01:44:55.204 --> 01:44:58.528]  Reesey in Louisiana, you're on the air.
[01:44:58.548 --> 01:45:00.930]  Alex, uh, you have my utmost respect, sir.
[01:45:01.071 --> 01:45:03.213]  Now, uh, how's my friend Ed Brown doing?
[01:45:03.963 --> 01:45:05.664]  Oh my God, that's in my stack.
[01:45:05.704 --> 01:45:06.725]  See, I said I've got the stack.
[01:45:07.105 --> 01:45:13.009]  They have sinnaged him and his wife, and we could have another Waco, and I've meant to tell my producer, we are going to try to get Ed Brown on the show.
[01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:16.072]  Very nice.
[01:45:16.152 --> 01:45:17.853]  Can I send him something?
[01:45:17.873 --> 01:45:22.356]  Because what he is doing is evoking the spirit that America should have against what you're trying to do.
[01:45:22.376 --> 01:45:23.357]  Let me try to find the article.
[01:45:23.397 --> 01:45:24.477]  Keep talking, I'll look for it.
[01:45:24.497 --> 01:45:27.820]  Keep going.
[01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:32.223]  I admire him because he has the courage that most people should have.
[01:45:33.001 --> 01:45:37.582]  He's an ordinary citizen, and yet he's captured the attention of the nation, hopefully by now.
[01:45:38.663 --> 01:45:41.884]  And I just think that it says a lot for this character.
[01:45:42.504 --> 01:45:43.884]  And I want that to be known to the people.
[01:45:44.144 --> 01:45:44.564]  No, it does.
[01:45:44.604 --> 01:45:50.986]  We've had him on the show before, and I've concluded any unpleasantness with the network that he's involved with, so I can have him on the show.
[01:45:51.626 --> 01:45:52.727]  And I'm gonna... Where is it?
[01:45:52.747 --> 01:45:53.867]  I had it here in my stack.
[01:45:55.047 --> 01:45:55.807]  This is the problem.
[01:45:55.888 --> 01:45:56.548]  I mean, I've just got...
[01:45:59.053 --> 01:46:00.654]  I'll reprint it if I have to.
[01:46:01.174 --> 01:46:01.695]  Absolutely.
[01:46:01.775 --> 01:46:04.236]  Ed Brown up in New Hampshire.
[01:46:05.037 --> 01:46:07.278]  And they're claiming he didn't pay taxes.
[01:46:07.599 --> 01:46:08.579]  And they came and set him up.
[01:46:08.639 --> 01:46:10.020]  It's a whole horrible sort of story.
[01:46:10.441 --> 01:46:12.602]  And now they've sentenced him and his wife in absentia.
[01:46:12.622 --> 01:46:13.983]  And they're going to come after him.
[01:46:15.584 --> 01:46:23.129]  Well, I've seen the footage and he's obviously a patriot by every standard of what our founding fathers would want it to be.
[01:46:24.069 --> 01:46:27.732]  And I think Americans need to start realizing that fact very, very soon.
[01:46:28.598 --> 01:46:30.178]  Because it's coming down to that point.
[01:46:31.959 --> 01:46:32.619]  Absolutely.
[01:46:32.879 --> 01:46:33.819]  Absolutely, my brother.
[01:46:33.859 --> 01:46:34.559]  Good to hear from you.
[01:46:34.579 --> 01:46:35.839]  And thank you for reminding me of that.
[01:46:35.859 --> 01:46:39.620]  That's the type of stuff I literally have like 50-something articles and they're all that important.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:40.580]  And one of them is Ed Brown.
[01:46:41.421 --> 01:46:44.761]  And we're going to watch that as it develops and we're going to get him on very soon and get him some support.
[01:46:47.282 --> 01:46:49.322]  Whereas the enemy comes like a thief in the night, don't they?
[01:46:50.022 --> 01:46:51.743]  Because he counterfeits everything God does.
[01:46:52.643 --> 01:46:53.503]  Who knows when they'll hit him.
[01:46:55.163 --> 01:46:56.604]  Let's talk to Sue in PA.
[01:46:56.644 --> 01:46:57.224]  You're on the air.
[01:46:57.264 --> 01:46:57.604]  Go ahead.
[01:46:58.812 --> 01:47:02.654]  Yeah, hey Alex, it's great to finally speak to you.
[01:47:03.054 --> 01:47:14.078]  I'm a paleo-conservative, I guess like you mentioned that you were, and I got a traditional kind of background, and I definitely know what the system does to people, because 20 years ago I was part of the rescue movement.
[01:47:14.578 --> 01:47:23.162]  And you know, what the system will do to you if you stand up for truth, it's... Well, they'll charge you as a mafia gangster for standing... I was charged with Rico, too, yeah.
[01:47:24.906 --> 01:47:29.312]  What I want to say about 9-11 is I've been with you for about three years on this.
[01:47:29.372 --> 01:47:30.414]  I've known all about it.
[01:47:31.375 --> 01:47:41.469]  I hate to admit I haven't had the courage to come out until lately because everybody I associate with, all my friends, it's kind of like traditional minded people.
[01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:46.384]  Just won't open up to... I don't know.
[01:47:46.444 --> 01:47:49.065]  It's like they're being co-opted by Fox News or something.
[01:47:49.105 --> 01:47:54.347]  I really can't put my finger on it, but... Oh no, they've been co-opted.
[01:47:54.747 --> 01:47:58.149]  Why don't you get the articles about Fox News being behind Hillary for them?
[01:47:58.729 --> 01:48:00.290]  Well, you know what?
[01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:05.832]  It's really hard to... It's like there has to be some kind of epiphany that they need to have.
[01:48:06.532 --> 01:48:07.853]  It took a lot for me to like...
[01:48:11.804 --> 01:48:17.267]  I mean, I find those things because, you know, in a lot of ways I'm really the antithesis of what she's about.
[01:48:17.367 --> 01:48:21.210]  Me too, me too, but if they take her free speech away, they're going to take ours.
[01:48:21.670 --> 01:48:29.395]  Absolutely, but so I went, I signed up for the website, and the next time I turned on the view, she's about gun control, so I'm kind of like,
[01:48:29.955 --> 01:48:31.017]  Screwed up?
[01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:33.159]  I'm not convincing... Here's the deal.
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:39.508]  I've said she's silly and ignorant on a lot of issues, but she's changing, she's coming over on a lot of issues.
[01:48:39.528 --> 01:48:42.031]  She's plugging John Connor, who's, you know, anti-abortion.
[01:48:43.012 --> 01:48:45.476]  And she knows what our views are, and she still supports us.
[01:48:46.124 --> 01:48:48.707]  And so, yeah, right after the shooting, Rosie's saying, see, I'm right.
[01:48:49.027 --> 01:48:50.469]  See, she doesn't understand everything.
[01:48:50.509 --> 01:48:52.110]  She's not going to be perfect.
[01:48:52.150 --> 01:48:54.453]  I disagree with her on a lot of things, and I understand that.
[01:48:54.493 --> 01:48:57.135]  But you were saying you supported her free speech right.
[01:48:57.516 --> 01:49:07.246]  Absolutely, and I do, but I can't... I'm not changing hearts and minds with Rosie, with the people that I've kind of been associated with, and my family and stuff.
[01:49:07.906 --> 01:49:09.747]  Well, no, that's why the media kind of likes her.
[01:49:09.767 --> 01:49:11.227]  They think it'll continue balkanizing.
[01:49:11.247 --> 01:49:13.548]  That's why they ignore all the conservatives that have gone public.
[01:49:13.848 --> 01:49:16.249]  But as long as it gets people talking, that's the key.
[01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:17.570]  Right, right.
[01:49:17.730 --> 01:49:21.711]  Well, that's really the only comment I had to make, and, you know, I think, you know, you're awesome.
[01:49:22.131 --> 01:49:22.572]  Well, thank you.
[01:49:22.592 --> 01:49:23.352]  You're awesome, too.
[01:49:23.932 --> 01:49:28.034]  Yeah, I mean, don't think a government that's authorized the abortion of 50 million children won't kill 3,000.
[01:49:28.554 --> 01:49:33.696]  And, again, some idiot had a website going, Alex Jones lies.
[01:49:33.856 --> 01:49:36.677]  One show he said 47 million, another show he said 50 million.
[01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.770]  I don't know.
[01:49:38.790 --> 01:49:40.671]  Like five years ago it was 47 million.
[01:49:40.751 --> 01:49:41.332]  I don't know what it is.
[01:49:41.352 --> 01:49:42.793]  I'm just guessing it's been 50 million.
[01:49:43.973 --> 01:49:45.635]  That's the kind of lies you'll catch me in.
[01:49:45.655 --> 01:49:46.435]  I'm guesstimating.
[01:49:46.535 --> 01:49:47.016]  I don't know.
[01:49:47.676 --> 01:49:49.177]  I mean, 10 million kids have been killed.
[01:49:49.197 --> 01:49:51.158]  We know it's over 45 million.
[01:49:52.399 --> 01:49:53.800]  See, people nitpick me on that.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:56.302]  I would guess it's well over 50 million now.
[01:49:57.543 --> 01:50:00.265]  But regardless, I mean, Stalin killed 50 and he killed 60.
[01:50:01.846 --> 01:50:02.966]  Mao killed 45 or 60.
[01:50:03.327 --> 01:50:04.327]  The Chinese government says 60.
[01:50:04.607 --> 01:50:06.769]  They say what he did was good, by the way.
[01:50:08.178 --> 01:50:13.222]  That's official Chinese government books put out on the subject.
[01:50:13.282 --> 01:50:16.445]  I mean, you know, I get all these emails going, you're making it up.
[01:50:16.485 --> 01:50:17.706]  There's no North American Union.
[01:50:17.726 --> 01:50:18.286]  You're making it up.
[01:50:18.326 --> 01:50:22.229]  There's no... I mean, I don't know how people out there are living in denial.
[01:50:22.590 --> 01:50:23.771]  How can you deny it?
[01:50:25.492 --> 01:50:27.714]  Oh, we got Lou Dobbs and the North American Union coming up.
[01:50:27.754 --> 01:50:29.115]  We got Jon Stewart coming up.
[01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:37.273]  With that Keith Olbermann clip coming up, we've done the Rosie and the They Live clip, but I will play at least part of those three clips in the next hour.
[01:50:37.653 --> 01:50:42.175]  When we get back, though, I'm going to talk to Trent and Chris and others, and continue with your phone calls.
[01:50:43.976 --> 01:50:45.097]  I do have the Ed Brown News.
[01:50:45.157 --> 01:50:46.498]  It's up on prisonplanet.com.
[01:50:46.538 --> 01:50:47.038]  I know that.
[01:50:48.079 --> 01:50:52.621]  Look, folks, I'm getting so busy on this show now, so focused on what's happening, I'm not even plugging my videos that much anymore.
[01:50:52.921 --> 01:50:54.282]  And that's how we fund this whole thing.
[01:50:55.378 --> 01:50:56.559]  Uh, I'll take 30 seconds here.
[01:50:56.579 --> 01:50:58.801]  I got a website, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:58.841 --> 01:51:01.823]  It's got a secure online video and bookstore shopping cart.
[01:51:02.143 --> 01:51:04.865]  It's got all my films and dozens and dozens of other films and books.
[01:51:05.526 --> 01:51:07.527]  And it's great stuff, really, to inform you.
[01:51:07.607 --> 01:51:09.749]  And you can make copies of my films, get them out to people.
[01:51:10.109 --> 01:51:12.191]  And that's how you support us so we can operate here.
[01:51:13.051 --> 01:51:15.073]  And, uh, you're not going to find anybody more committed.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.643]  You're not going to find anybody with their hair more on fire.
[01:51:18.364 --> 01:51:20.006]  And it's us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:51:20.547 --> 01:51:22.169]  And we'd like you to support us in the fight.
[01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:23.732]  Infowars.com.
[01:51:24.172 --> 01:51:24.673]  You missed it.
[01:51:24.693 --> 01:51:27.016]  I'll give you the toll-free number when we get back and go back to your call.
[01:51:27.036 --> 01:51:27.397]  Stay with us.
[01:51:34.605 --> 01:51:40.029]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:51:40.429 --> 01:51:47.975]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:51:48.757 --> 01:51:55.798]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:51:56.198 --> 01:52:07.620]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:52:07.940 --> 01:52:11.461]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:52:11.901 --> 01:52:13.821]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:52:14.161 --> 01:52:17.942]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[01:52:18.602 --> 01:52:25.612]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:52:31.204 --> 01:52:34.226]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:52:34.527 --> 01:52:39.450]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:52:39.731 --> 01:52:44.074]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:52:44.374 --> 01:52:53.281]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:52:53.501 --> 01:52:57.104]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:52:57.384 --> 01:53:02.427]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:53:02.727 --> 01:53:09.450]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:53:09.931 --> 01:53:10.471]  What about you?
[01:53:11.227 --> 01:53:16.590]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:53:31.167 --> 01:53:32.888]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:53:33.108 --> 01:53:36.811]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[01:53:37.131 --> 01:53:39.353]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions.
[01:53:39.873 --> 01:53:46.078]  Credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more all in the hands of a total stranger.
[01:53:46.238 --> 01:53:53.163]  What's worse is you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked every time you walk away from your computer.
[01:53:53.363 --> 01:54:00.348]  Leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[01:54:00.668 --> 01:54:06.692]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:57.701]  Welcome back.
[01:55:01.584 --> 01:55:03.765]  Vito Valentia will be joining us.
[01:55:03.785 --> 01:55:05.747]  It's for about 10-15 minutes.
[01:55:05.767 --> 01:55:07.168]  He's one of the first responders.
[01:55:07.908 --> 01:55:11.051]  He's gonna be on with Rosie tomorrow, unless that gets censored and edited, too.
[01:55:11.869 --> 01:55:15.033]  And then we'll continue with your calls and I will play all those clips and get to this news.
[01:55:17.275 --> 01:55:27.706]  If you do want to support us so we can fund our operation and have an effect, and you're authorized to make copies of all my films, you're authorized to make copies of most of the films we carry too.
[01:55:27.726 --> 01:55:29.308]  I know they've authorized people to make copies.
[01:55:29.328 --> 01:55:31.450]  9-11 Mysteries, I know that...
[01:55:32.455 --> 01:55:34.436]  Aaron Russo has authorized people to make copies.
[01:55:34.616 --> 01:55:37.738]  I know that Dylan Avery has authorized copies of Loose Change 2nd Edition.
[01:55:38.139 --> 01:55:40.160]  Those are all available at InfoWars.com.
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:48.125]  These are originals made by the authors, by the filmmakers, by the people that wrote the books, the things we carry.
[01:55:48.145 --> 01:55:52.988]  So you also are supporting them when you buy it from us and supporting us at the same time.
[01:55:53.028 --> 01:55:55.509]  So be sure to visit InfoWars.com.
[01:55:55.930 --> 01:55:56.790]  The toll-free number is 888-253-3139.
[01:56:01.903 --> 01:56:02.063]  888-253-3139.
[01:56:02.083 --> 01:56:04.326]  And you can also write to me.
[01:56:04.406 --> 01:56:09.291]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[01:56:09.332 --> 01:56:10.793]  And don't ever forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:24.332 --> 01:56:29.496]  Alright, again, Vito Valenti joining us coming up at the 8 after.
[01:56:29.656 --> 01:56:35.159]  We'll go ahead and go to some of your calls from then on, from this point on until we get to that point.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:38.582]  Trent in Texas, you're on the air, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[01:56:39.502 --> 01:56:40.983]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:56:41.144 --> 01:56:42.464]  Thanks for calling, what's on your mind?
[01:56:42.985 --> 01:56:47.488]  I just wanted to take the time to expose someone named Dennis Kucinich.
[01:56:48.474 --> 01:57:03.161]  This individual is drafting legislation to impeach Dick Cheney, which is definitely a good thing in my opinion, but hidden deep within the bowels of his profile is the fact that he's also drafting legislation to completely ban handguns in the United States.
[01:57:03.221 --> 01:57:11.145]  Yeah, we actually, Paul Watson last week did a big article about Kucinich, I believe the headline is Kucinich, traitor to ban guns.
[01:57:12.117 --> 01:57:17.641]  And Kucinich is right on weather control, right on 9-11, right on the war.
[01:57:17.721 --> 01:57:20.483]  But no, he is an absolute, complete communist.
[01:57:20.984 --> 01:57:21.964]  And that's the thing.
[01:57:22.665 --> 01:57:26.468]  They're just as bad as Bush and the Trotskyite New World Order people.
[01:57:26.748 --> 01:57:29.410]  He wants a total handgun ban.
[01:57:30.150 --> 01:57:31.371]  And that is treason.
[01:57:31.391 --> 01:57:37.715]  I mean, anybody... Listen, if I was president, I would call for him to be investigated and arrested.
[01:57:38.196 --> 01:57:38.916]  And I'll tell you why.
[01:57:39.156 --> 01:57:40.397]  It's not free speech, folks.
[01:57:40.657 --> 01:57:46.461]  You start calling for abolishing... I believe Bush would be arrested for his attacks on the Fourth Amendment, and the First Amendment, and all of it.
[01:57:46.762 --> 01:57:49.163]  And I'm telling you, that's what you... Because here's the deal.
[01:57:49.383 --> 01:57:50.264]  He's in government.
[01:57:50.604 --> 01:57:52.206]  A citizen could call for gun bans.
[01:57:52.546 --> 01:58:02.895]  That piece of filth, and I'm not attacking Kucinich right now on air, Kucinich is a congressman who's sworn of, he now represents the people, and that's high treason.
[01:58:02.915 --> 01:58:03.335]  Go ahead.
[01:58:04.796 --> 01:58:10.221]  Well, he just says how he's protecting the Constitution, but I mean, he really is just lying, because he's trying to tear it apart.
[01:58:12.140 --> 01:58:14.921]  I think he should be arrested and tried on treason charges.
[01:58:15.221 --> 01:58:17.681]  It's just amazing what angles they're hitting us from.
[01:58:18.061 --> 01:58:20.602]  It's hard because the average people, I don't know if they're doing their investigation.
[01:58:20.622 --> 01:58:21.422]  Hey look, it's simple.
[01:58:21.562 --> 01:58:22.142]  It's simple.
[01:58:22.182 --> 01:58:30.363]  You come right out and say abolish one of the ten amendments and you are a high-level federal official, you get indicted for treason.
[01:58:30.563 --> 01:58:31.264]  It's real simple.
[01:58:31.984 --> 01:58:39.345]  Believe me folks, if somebody in government in say 1805 called for gun bans, they would be arrested.
[01:58:40.985 --> 01:58:41.485]  Exactly.
[01:58:41.505 --> 01:58:42.166]  Period!
[01:58:42.586 --> 01:58:45.768]  I don't know what happened to real Americans, and that's really my only comment.
[01:58:45.848 --> 01:58:47.169]  So watch out for Dennis Kucinich.
[01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.730]  That guy's evil.
[01:58:48.030 --> 01:58:49.371]  Oh, watch out for all of them.
[01:58:49.451 --> 01:58:51.592]  Hillary, that whole crowd of scum.
[01:58:52.313 --> 01:58:56.836]  Let me just tell all the fake liberals out there and the fake conservatives, I hate all of you, okay?
[01:58:57.436 --> 01:58:57.977]  I hate you.
[01:58:58.497 --> 01:58:59.898]  Because you're ignorant fools.
[01:59:01.079 --> 01:59:01.479]  Okay?
[01:59:01.599 --> 01:59:03.260]  You all work for the same people.
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:07.103]  Either become patriots and come in for the big win, or get out of my way.
[01:59:11.357 --> 01:59:17.161]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.

[02:00:34.026 --> 02:00:35.106]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:35.807 --> 02:00:36.907]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:37.567 --> 02:00:38.367]  You want answers?
[02:00:39.148 --> 02:00:40.068]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:40.688 --> 02:00:44.429]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:44.890 --> 02:00:48.971]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:50.373 --> 02:00:51.294]  We're good.
[02:01:08.394 --> 02:01:12.515]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number three.
[02:01:12.655 --> 02:01:14.136]  Did Trent ever finish?
[02:01:14.176 --> 02:01:15.876]  He brought up a point after the rambling.
[02:01:16.216 --> 02:01:17.377]  Is Trent still there or is he gone?
[02:01:17.617 --> 02:01:18.277]  He's gone, okay.
[02:01:18.477 --> 02:01:19.037]  Thank you, Trent.
[02:01:19.357 --> 02:01:21.118]  Chris, where are you calling us from today?
[02:01:25.599 --> 02:01:27.179]  Sounds like an exciting place, Chris.
[02:01:27.939 --> 02:01:29.340]  Who's up next after Chris?
[02:01:30.760 --> 02:01:32.241]  Stewart, New York, you're on the air.
[02:01:32.301 --> 02:01:32.641]  Welcome.
[02:01:33.281 --> 02:01:33.801]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:34.061 --> 02:01:36.862]  Getting back to Rosie and her gun issue.
[02:01:37.938 --> 02:01:47.243]  Is it possible that when you talk to her, you can make her realize that the same people who pulled off 9-11 are the same people who are looking to take away the guns?
[02:01:47.323 --> 02:01:49.544]  It's a very close nexus.
[02:01:49.924 --> 02:01:55.087]  In doing that, do you think that would alienate her from those people who are supporting her?
[02:01:55.956 --> 02:02:14.340]  Well, look, Rosie isn't perfect, but I've analyzed what she's doing, I've talked to people that know her well, I've had a few communications, and the bottom line is, Rosie O'Donnell is learning the truth, she's waking up, she's never called for a total gun ban, just all this registration bull, and so I don't say she's a traitor because she's ignorant.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:20.121]  Kucinich is because he knows exactly what he's doing, and he called for a total gun ban.
[02:02:20.721 --> 02:02:23.463]  I certainly hope she makes the jump to the pro-gun issue.
[02:02:36.045 --> 02:02:41.549]  She may never, because of the incredible peer pressure and past fights, but she could.
[02:02:41.569 --> 02:02:46.133]  I mean, look, Hanoi Jane came out and said she was a born-again Christian.
[02:02:46.153 --> 02:02:46.533]  Remember that?
[02:02:47.073 --> 02:02:47.714]  Oh, very well.
[02:02:47.734 --> 02:02:50.736]  And then, of course, the neocons still scorned her.
[02:02:52.097 --> 02:02:54.879]  They don't like people repenting or saying they were wrong.
[02:02:55.319 --> 02:02:56.000]  They don't like that.
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:56.620]  They know.
[02:02:58.282 --> 02:03:04.046]  The logical choice for her would be to come over to the pro-gun side, only because
[02:03:04.648 --> 02:03:08.811]  Who are you going to turn to if the new world order is doing what they're doing?
[02:03:09.011 --> 02:03:11.733]  Well, see, all the liberals I know aren't mainline liberals anymore.
[02:03:11.753 --> 02:03:12.453]  They figured that out.
[02:03:12.473 --> 02:03:13.454]  They're out buying guns.
[02:03:13.794 --> 02:03:14.875]  They're at the shooting range.
[02:03:15.995 --> 02:03:17.376]  And they say, I understand now.
[02:03:17.436 --> 02:03:18.577]  This is about security.
[02:03:19.017 --> 02:03:19.598]  I understand.
[02:03:19.618 --> 02:03:21.319]  We're going into a fascist dictatorship.
[02:03:21.659 --> 02:03:23.740]  Now I understand what you always talk about.
[02:03:24.901 --> 02:03:26.882]  Believe me, man, there's a major change happening.
[02:03:27.282 --> 02:03:29.304]  The main problem is these fake conservatives.
[02:03:29.564 --> 02:03:31.165]  They're almost impossible to reach.
[02:03:32.813 --> 02:03:37.456]  Well, I certainly hope that when you do get her on your show, you can put a bug in her ear regarding that.
[02:03:37.996 --> 02:03:38.376]  We'll see.
[02:03:38.416 --> 02:03:39.917]  It's really hard to get her on programs.
[02:03:39.957 --> 02:03:44.240]  I found out she doesn't do a lot of interviews, so... Thank you for everything you do, Alex.
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:45.021]  Thank you.
[02:03:45.341 --> 02:03:45.681]  Thank you.
[02:03:45.741 --> 02:03:46.722]  I really appreciate you.
[02:03:46.742 --> 02:03:52.165]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:03:52.205 --> 02:03:54.006]  Who's after the last caller?
[02:03:55.667 --> 02:03:56.948]  Kenny, in case she... Go ahead, Kenny.
[02:04:00.831 --> 02:04:04.373]  I don't know what's going on, but we'll take your call, Kenny, if you're ready.
[02:04:05.113 --> 02:04:05.453]  You know what?
[02:04:05.533 --> 02:04:06.474]  It's too close to break.
[02:04:06.714 --> 02:04:28.184]  When it rains, it pours, and the callers are all off playing hopscotch or tiddlywinks, so we will just go to our guest after this quick break, Vito Valente, one of the first responders, and we will be going over that with him when he joins us coming up in the next segment.
[02:04:28.224 --> 02:04:29.004]  Honored to have him.
[02:04:29.975 --> 02:04:31.976]  And he's going to be on The View tomorrow.
[02:04:31.996 --> 02:04:33.936]  It was going to be last week, but the shooting happened.
[02:04:34.276 --> 02:04:35.117]  So they got canceled.
[02:04:35.137 --> 02:04:35.797]  So they taped it.
[02:04:36.437 --> 02:04:37.938]  They taped it Wednesday.
[02:04:38.438 --> 02:04:39.598]  They were live today.
[02:04:40.658 --> 02:04:45.960]  And... Oh, that was the point that has to be added to the Paul Watson article.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:47.941]  I kept knowing there was something I was forgetting.
[02:04:47.961 --> 02:04:48.981]  It was the key to the whole deal.
[02:04:49.955 --> 02:04:51.035]  I gotta call Paul Watson.
[02:04:51.075 --> 02:04:54.356]  I know he just wrote an article about Rosie and put the key in it about William Rodriguez.
[02:04:54.917 --> 02:05:02.719]  It's that she tried to talk about William Rodriguez today when it was live and all of them jumped on her and wouldn't let her say his name.
[02:05:03.539 --> 02:05:08.221]  Literally talked over and there may have been some on-the-fly editing as they delay it by 10 seconds.
[02:05:08.281 --> 02:05:09.061]  Now that was the key.
[02:05:09.501 --> 02:05:11.782]  She tried to talk about Rodriguez and we can now talk about that.
[02:05:12.402 --> 02:05:16.163]  About how she's been wanting to have him on the show and was blocked by the sniveling neocon.
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:18.280]  So there was the big development there.
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:21.341]  We're going to talk to Vito Valente on the other side.
[02:05:21.361 --> 02:05:25.743]  Stay with me.
[02:05:25.883 --> 02:05:31.985]  It's here.
[02:05:32.165 --> 02:05:36.946]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:05:37.307 --> 02:05:44.849]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:45.635 --> 02:05:52.699]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:53.099 --> 02:06:04.505]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:06:04.845 --> 02:06:08.387]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:06:08.808 --> 02:06:10.749]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:14.911]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:07:00.537 --> 02:07:04.019]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:07:28.195 --> 02:07:34.678]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:07:34.919 --> 02:07:38.941]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:07:39.201 --> 02:07:41.362]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:07:41.702 --> 02:07:48.726]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:07:49.066 --> 02:07:51.647]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:07:51.927 --> 02:07:55.389]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:07:55.689 --> 02:08:03.591]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:08:03.951 --> 02:08:05.471]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:08:05.731 --> 02:08:20.035]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[02:08:20.835 --> 02:08:26.219]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:08:32.944 --> 02:08:33.625]  Big Brother.
[02:08:34.245 --> 02:08:35.326]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:36.027 --> 02:08:37.128]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:37.768 --> 02:08:38.589]  You want answers?
[02:08:39.369 --> 02:08:40.430]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:40.910 --> 02:08:44.573]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:45.094 --> 02:08:49.177]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:55.726 --> 02:08:59.527]  We are now about eight and a half minutes into this third hour.
[02:08:59.547 --> 02:09:06.829]  I want to get him and other first responders and survivors on for a full hour sometime and have two or three of these great Americans on with us.
[02:09:07.829 --> 02:09:09.229]  But we've just got him for this segment.
[02:09:09.249 --> 02:09:09.909]  Very, very busy.
[02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:13.650]  And he's Vito Valente.
[02:09:13.670 --> 02:09:16.131]  I hope I was mispronouncing his Valente.
[02:09:16.767 --> 02:09:21.669]  And I've got a CBS News article here, 9-11 first responders were dead men walking years after attacks.
[02:09:21.689 --> 02:09:22.729]  Many face reality.
[02:09:23.110 --> 02:09:24.030]  Death may be near.
[02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:26.091]  He has to be on a breathing machine.
[02:09:26.351 --> 02:09:30.693]  I've interviewed in New York, in person, these guys, where I've seen them coughing up blood, folks.
[02:09:30.733 --> 02:09:32.193]  I mean, blood pouring out of them.
[02:09:32.213 --> 02:09:38.936]  I don't mean to get into details here, but where they're coughing and you see the handkerchief literally covered with gobs of blood.
[02:09:40.184 --> 02:09:41.705]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[02:09:42.145 --> 02:09:46.226]  When they can't hardly walk upstairs, they've got breathing machines, oxygen machines.
[02:09:46.246 --> 02:09:47.667]  They're literally coughing their lungs up.
[02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:49.207]  And I'm talking to Corey Rove.
[02:09:49.227 --> 02:09:50.788]  I don't even know how I'm supposed to talk about this.
[02:09:51.008 --> 02:09:52.188]  He made loose change.
[02:09:52.628 --> 02:09:54.489]  He's coughing up blood almost every day.
[02:09:55.349 --> 02:09:57.110]  And to you folks, he knows what it is.
[02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:03.212]  This is the stinking people that run this country.
[02:10:04.372 --> 02:10:05.673]  They are absolute scum.
[02:10:06.696 --> 02:10:11.900]  And we need to financially help Vito Valente and all of these people.
[02:10:13.501 --> 02:10:17.364]  It says, CBS2 spoke to many who now say they are dead men walking.
[02:10:17.404 --> 02:10:22.548]  First responders charged towards ground zero on the morning of 9-11, united in their mission.
[02:10:22.608 --> 02:10:24.369]  I saw the second plane hit, both towers come down.
[02:10:24.630 --> 02:10:27.712]  Vito Valente said, I went from day to day, day to night.
[02:10:28.334 --> 02:10:32.077]  Tell us in a nutshell what you did, how you responded, and what's happened to you.
[02:10:32.117 --> 02:10:32.877]  I was down there at 9-11.
[02:10:32.897 --> 02:10:33.778]  I was at 125 Barclays.
[02:10:58.622 --> 02:10:59.662]  And I was in my office.
[02:11:00.643 --> 02:11:05.484]  Um, I was a grievance rep for the Board of Education, Local 372, District Council 37.
[02:11:06.484 --> 02:11:09.205]  And basically, I was down there that morning.
[02:11:09.285 --> 02:11:11.326]  I seen the second plane hit.
[02:11:12.046 --> 02:11:13.707]  Um, both towers came down.
[02:11:14.527 --> 02:11:16.467]  Um, I got hit with that toxic cloud.
[02:11:17.508 --> 02:11:19.428]  Um, I did search and rescue.
[02:11:19.448 --> 02:11:20.669]  I, you know, I volunteered.
[02:11:20.689 --> 02:11:22.289]  I did search and rescue.
[02:11:22.309 --> 02:11:27.031]  Um, did the Bucket Bigger Brigade, uh, help with medical equipment.
[02:11:27.451 --> 02:11:28.091]  You know, uh,
[02:11:29.842 --> 02:11:42.431]  The whole thing, I've seen, you know, all these bodies, the bodies falling, body parts, I removed body parts, picked up body parts, did everything.
[02:11:44.292 --> 02:11:58.302]  I was down there for two days, inhaled all those toxic fumes, and now, later on, I'm diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, what Officer Cesar Borger died of.
[02:11:59.261 --> 02:12:00.883]  I need a double lung transplant.
[02:12:01.604 --> 02:12:04.889]  I'm suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.
[02:12:05.210 --> 02:12:06.552]  I have lesions on my leg.
[02:12:07.259 --> 02:12:11.462]  GERD, restricted airway, I'm not able to sleep at night.
[02:12:11.602 --> 02:12:26.653]  Now see, as soon as these problems came up six months after, it turns out of course they knew and covered it up, they should have immediately given first dibs, thousands of people die a week, lungs a lot of time get thrown in the trash, and you guys could have all gotten new lungs and it could have been paid for.
[02:12:27.033 --> 02:12:27.914]  That's right, yeah.
[02:12:27.994 --> 02:12:35.079]  I mean, when we were down there, we didn't have no, no state didn't give us no respirators, they didn't give us nothing at all.
[02:12:35.618 --> 02:12:39.961]  I mean, all I had was an orange vest, and they gave us a little mesh vest.
[02:12:39.981 --> 02:12:41.862]  That's all they gave us.
[02:12:43.023 --> 02:12:47.146]  And, you know, I mean, now I'm really suffering.
[02:12:47.506 --> 02:12:49.627]  You know, I haven't been able to sleep.
[02:12:49.707 --> 02:12:50.608]  I'm on oxygen.
[02:12:51.008 --> 02:12:54.591]  I take like 23, 24 pills a day, every day.
[02:12:54.611 --> 02:12:59.494]  I haven't been able to lay down in a bed, laying down for almost four years now.
[02:12:59.734 --> 02:13:02.616]  I sleep in a chair in the living room, sleeping up.
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:04.561]  Um, cause I can't lay down.
[02:13:04.941 --> 02:13:06.482]  I have lesions on my leg.
[02:13:07.042 --> 02:13:09.063]  Um, my leg is completely swollen.
[02:13:09.343 --> 02:13:10.784]  My heart's enlarged now.
[02:13:11.664 --> 02:13:13.965]  Um, and I'm not even on a transplant list yet.
[02:13:14.966 --> 02:13:20.288]  Um, also, you know, I'm the, I'm the secretary for the Feel Good Foundation.
[02:13:20.368 --> 02:13:25.711]  It's a foundation that helps, we help and assist 9-11 responders that are sick.
[02:13:25.791 --> 02:13:27.932]  And you know, while I'm battling my illness,
[02:13:28.499 --> 02:13:31.061]  I'm out, you know, I'm concentrating.
[02:13:31.201 --> 02:13:32.742]  It's no more about me now.
[02:13:33.022 --> 02:13:33.602]  I want to help.
[02:13:33.943 --> 02:13:36.684]  And of course, that's named after John Feel, another first responder.
[02:13:36.704 --> 02:13:37.445]  John Feel, yes.
[02:13:37.485 --> 02:13:38.686]  John Feel is the president.
[02:13:38.766 --> 02:13:40.847]  I'm the secretary of the foundation.
[02:13:40.927 --> 02:13:52.455]  And, you know, John, when everybody else wasn't there for me, this foundation, the Feel Good Foundation, they were the only ones that were there for me.
[02:13:52.995 --> 02:13:54.456]  And they came to my house.
[02:13:54.656 --> 02:13:56.157]  I wrote to everybody for help.
[02:13:56.778 --> 02:13:59.661]  And my own job, Local 372, abandoned me.
[02:13:59.921 --> 02:14:02.923]  They haven't called me, even till this day, my job.
[02:14:03.904 --> 02:14:08.888]  We represented the Board of Education, the City of New York, school aides, cafeteria workers.
[02:14:09.349 --> 02:14:10.049]  They didn't bother.
[02:14:10.089 --> 02:14:12.792]  The only ones that really helped me was my colleagues.
[02:14:13.332 --> 02:14:15.514]  All the president and all the vice president.
[02:14:15.534 --> 02:14:17.496]  And I worked with the vice president down there.
[02:14:17.836 --> 02:14:19.297]  We did it together, Ground Zero.
[02:14:19.558 --> 02:14:22.000]  And they didn't even bother even standing by me.
[02:14:22.896 --> 02:14:23.116]  I don't
[02:14:43.822 --> 02:14:46.403]  We know, the government is not doing nothing.
[02:14:46.423 --> 02:14:53.848]  There's a lot of firemen, there's a lot of police officers that are coming down with cancer, different cancers, that they're not getting the treatment.
[02:14:56.150 --> 02:15:00.553]  Sure, I mean they know that this was happening, they knew this was happening.
[02:15:00.873 --> 02:15:05.116]  Why do you think that the government ordered Christina Todd Whitman to cover up how deadly that dust was?
[02:15:05.676 --> 02:15:07.037]  I don't, I really don't know.
[02:15:07.337 --> 02:15:09.919]  I really don't know, but all I can tell you is
[02:15:10.399 --> 02:15:11.000]  I think so.
[02:15:30.106 --> 02:15:32.947]  The government is spending too much money on nonsense things.
[02:15:33.047 --> 02:15:36.808]  I mean, the President is spending so much money on this war.
[02:15:37.288 --> 02:15:39.749]  I mean, they should be concentrating on us.
[02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:41.529]  Worry about what's in our own pockets.
[02:15:41.569 --> 02:15:43.930]  Well, I will add one more point.
[02:15:44.030 --> 02:15:49.171]  I did tell Rosie, and this was three or four weeks ago through Ebersole when they were on vacation together in Miami.
[02:15:49.571 --> 02:15:53.532]  I said, tell her tonight when you meet with her, tell her, have first responders on.
[02:15:53.912 --> 02:15:56.793]  Expose that, because you know Rosie was being attacked for her other statements.
[02:15:57.173 --> 02:15:57.673]  Yeah.
[02:15:57.874 --> 02:16:00.796]  And see if they can attack you for defending the first responders.
[02:16:01.276 --> 02:16:01.677]  Exactly.
[02:16:01.717 --> 02:16:02.678]  Well, that's what she did.
[02:16:02.998 --> 02:16:10.164]  And I tell you, when I was on The View yesterday, and I was telling my story, and I was also on with Bonnie Giffreid.
[02:16:10.504 --> 02:16:12.405]  She was an EMS worker.
[02:16:12.425 --> 02:16:13.166]  She was there with me.
[02:16:13.746 --> 02:16:20.412]  And also in the audience was Alex Sanchez and Dr. Jacqueline Moline from Mount Sinai.
[02:16:20.892 --> 02:16:26.697]  When I was telling my story to her, she came out and Rosie says, and I also hear something was wrong with your leg.
[02:16:27.082 --> 02:16:35.225]  So when I picked up my leg and I showed her how swollen, I mean, the whole audience just was, they gasped because my leg was so swollen.
[02:16:35.665 --> 02:16:36.946]  And Rosie says, my God.
[02:16:37.006 --> 02:16:38.326]  And she actually started crying.
[02:16:38.586 --> 02:16:41.087]  I mean, she, she started, tears started coming out.
[02:16:41.127 --> 02:16:46.229]  She just hugged me and she told the audience, she says, you see, this is what the government is doing.
[02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:48.490]  They're not doing nothing for these responders.
[02:16:48.890 --> 02:16:49.871]  They were here for us.
[02:16:50.171 --> 02:16:51.851]  Now we have to be here for them.
[02:16:51.871 --> 02:16:53.572]  You know, we're like,
[02:16:54.113 --> 02:16:58.095]  The Vietnam veterans, we're like the forgotten people, and enough is enough.
[02:16:58.295 --> 02:17:00.976]  How many more lives have to be lost?
[02:17:01.096 --> 02:17:02.737]  What is it like for you, sir?
[02:17:03.237 --> 02:17:05.178]  Let me ask you this.
[02:17:05.479 --> 02:17:17.965]  What is it like for you, Vito, to see the President and the Democrats as well, Giuliani, all of them, wrap themselves in the American flag and use your names every day to call themselves heroes?
[02:17:18.365 --> 02:17:19.045]  It's a disgrace.
[02:17:19.405 --> 02:17:20.086]  It's a disgrace.
[02:17:21.266 --> 02:17:22.547]  It's a disgrace how
[02:17:23.107 --> 02:17:27.331]  This government is treating us and how the president, the president hasn't done nothing.
[02:17:28.092 --> 02:17:29.353]  I mean, hasn't done nothing for us.
[02:17:29.613 --> 02:17:30.774]  What has Giuliani done?
[02:17:30.975 --> 02:17:32.776]  Giuliani has not done nothing.
[02:17:33.117 --> 02:17:42.606]  And he's calling, he's using his name and his run for the president, you know, he's using 9-11 as, oh yeah, I was the mayor and I was down there.
[02:17:42.826 --> 02:17:43.927]  What is he doing for us?
[02:17:44.648 --> 02:17:45.909]  He hasn't done nothing for us.
[02:17:46.761 --> 02:17:48.063]  I mean the president.
[02:17:48.283 --> 02:17:49.424]  The president shows up.
[02:17:49.664 --> 02:17:51.206]  What's the president done?
[02:17:51.506 --> 02:17:55.070]  We've written so many letters to have the president meet with all of us.
[02:17:55.371 --> 02:17:56.472]  He still hasn't met with us.
[02:17:57.473 --> 02:17:58.134]  He's done.
[02:17:58.194 --> 02:17:59.555]  He's already used your name.
[02:17:59.595 --> 02:18:00.636]  He's already got your name.
[02:18:00.656 --> 02:18:00.777]  Yeah.
[02:18:01.217 --> 02:18:05.562]  I mean, you know, he's, I mean myself, using myself as an example.
[02:18:06.604 --> 02:18:09.606]  My condition is pulmonary fibrosis.
[02:18:09.866 --> 02:18:14.449]  The life expectancy is no more than five, maybe five and a half years.
[02:18:14.669 --> 02:18:18.131]  And that was from my doctor coming on national TV and saying this.
[02:18:18.631 --> 02:18:22.814]  Well, they've already had all these big top institutes and top hospitals.
[02:18:23.154 --> 02:18:28.137]  Three years ago, do the scans in your lungs are full of glass and concrete and asbestos.
[02:18:28.457 --> 02:18:35.761]  Oh, I tell you, when that cloud hit me, you know, we had crushed concrete, glass, body parts, jet fuel, asbestos.
[02:18:36.341 --> 02:18:36.942]  Let's do it!
[02:18:52.839 --> 02:18:53.440]  It couldn't have been.
[02:18:53.580 --> 02:18:56.162]  That toxic cloud didn't just hang over Ground Zero.
[02:18:56.402 --> 02:18:57.042]  It traveled.
[02:18:57.242 --> 02:18:57.843]  Well, we know.
[02:18:57.883 --> 02:19:01.986]  It even blew across the river to the... Exactly.
[02:19:02.086 --> 02:19:04.688]  It went to Jersey, Brooklyn, Queens.
[02:19:04.748 --> 02:19:08.731]  I mean, it's... You know, and a lot of people are suffering.
[02:19:08.931 --> 02:19:10.613]  You know, I get calls every day.
[02:19:11.033 --> 02:19:15.176]  You know, I get... I got a call from a responder out in Florida.
[02:19:15.957 --> 02:19:17.578]  He was the property manager.
[02:19:18.118 --> 02:19:20.440]  He was the property manager for World Trade Centers.
[02:19:20.902 --> 02:19:21.603]  I don't know.
[02:19:31.943 --> 02:19:33.805]  Um, to register with Mount Sinai.
[02:19:34.125 --> 02:19:35.686]  Um, I even put him up at my house.
[02:19:35.946 --> 02:19:37.067]  How's Mike McCormick doing?
[02:19:37.087 --> 02:19:37.988]  I know he's really sick.
[02:19:38.388 --> 02:19:39.289]  Mike is doing good.
[02:19:39.369 --> 02:19:41.091]  Mike is, you know, he's hanging in there.
[02:19:41.691 --> 02:19:44.854]  Um, you know, I mean, we're all, we're all a team.
[02:19:44.874 --> 02:19:46.055]  You know, we're all hanging in there.
[02:19:46.235 --> 02:19:47.636]  We're trying to do the best we can.
[02:19:47.656 --> 02:19:52.620]  Um, John, with his... Now, of course, you know about all the police harassment.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:55.903]  And he was a big hero, found the American flag, was up there with Bush.
[02:19:55.983 --> 02:19:58.685]  As soon as he spoke out, boy, the cops started coming after him.
[02:19:59.657 --> 02:20:00.398]  Well, you know what?
[02:20:00.418 --> 02:20:01.659]  Because they don't want to hear the truth.
[02:20:02.259 --> 02:20:02.559]  You know?
[02:20:02.800 --> 02:20:05.242]  I mean, to me, he's a hero.
[02:20:05.302 --> 02:20:07.463]  He's the one that found the American flag.
[02:20:07.644 --> 02:20:12.267]  But see, they like their bosses who poison them and then don't help them.
[02:20:12.768 --> 02:20:15.530]  I mean, that's like a dog you beat in the head and it still loves you.
[02:20:15.890 --> 02:20:18.673]  It's like a dog you beat every day for no reason and it still loves you.
[02:20:18.693 --> 02:20:20.054]  I mean, that is pathetic.
[02:20:20.114 --> 02:20:20.454]  Stay there.
[02:20:20.514 --> 02:20:21.235]  One more segment, sir.
[02:20:21.255 --> 02:20:24.978]  I want to talk about how people can support you and help other first responders, Vito.

[02:21:29.139 --> 02:21:31.080]  Hi, John Huebner from Midas Resources.
[02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.981]  Are you tired of watching your hard-earned assets dwindle away?
[02:21:34.301 --> 02:21:42.604]  As government spending is out of hand and the Federal Reserve is creating in excess of $20 billion a week, are you tired of stockbrokers gambling away your hard-earned money?
[02:21:42.904 --> 02:21:45.725]  Is this market a setup for a crash greater than 1987?
[02:21:46.565 --> 02:21:49.766]  Too many of today's policies resemble those that led to the collapse of 1929.
[02:21:51.086 --> 02:21:52.667]  How much are you willing to lose?
[02:21:53.087 --> 02:21:53.988]  Take action now!
[02:21:54.148 --> 02:21:58.610]  Call me at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:21:58.950 --> 02:22:02.732]  I believe that we are facing a financial catastrophe of biblical proportion.
[02:22:02.933 --> 02:22:06.134]  Over recent decades, numerous economic systems have failed.
[02:22:06.254 --> 02:22:12.698]  Current Federal Reserve policy and uncontrolled government spending have set the stage for the United States to be the next target.
[02:22:12.998 --> 02:22:18.003]  Secure your assets today by calling 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:22:18.964 --> 02:22:21.067]  Do this while paper can still buy gold.
[02:22:21.287 --> 02:22:22.989]  Call me, John Huebner, at 1-800-686-2237, extension 129.
[02:22:30.379 --> 02:22:34.500]  Did you ever wonder how an opera singer that hits a high note is able to shatter a wine glass?
[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:36.480]  Well, the glass has a natural resonance.
[02:22:36.741 --> 02:22:43.042]  If the resonant frequency force making the glass vibrate is big enough, the size of the vibration will become so large that the glass shatters.
[02:22:43.322 --> 02:22:49.444]  Using a similar principle, Royal Raymond Rife discovered that diseased organisms can be destroyed using different resonant frequencies.
[02:22:49.704 --> 02:22:51.544]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument
[02:22:51.684 --> 02:22:52.244]  I think so.
[02:23:14.312 --> 02:23:15.353]  Eliminate the cause.

[02:23:18.094 --> 02:23:18.154]  1-866-885-6625.
[02:23:28.848 --> 02:23:31.309]  Automakers in the oil industry are in a fuel fight.
[02:23:31.709 --> 02:23:34.691]  Automakers claim gasoline quality doesn't measure up.
[02:23:34.991 --> 02:23:37.052]  Is your vehicle performing like it should?
[02:23:37.372 --> 02:23:41.654]  Now, there's SFR Green, performance technologies for a clean planet.
[02:23:42.014 --> 02:23:48.297]  SFR Green's Protecta reduces emissions and improves fuel economy, meeting automakers' new standards.
[02:23:48.317 --> 02:23:49.378]  So do something green.

[02:24:02.049 --> 02:24:03.950]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[02:24:04.670 --> 02:24:07.851]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[02:24:08.492 --> 02:24:14.974]  It is liquid, it is private, it owes no one, it cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[02:24:15.754 --> 02:24:17.955]  Find your answer at Midas Resources.
[02:24:18.335 --> 02:24:18.655]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:18.695 --> 02:24:19.155]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:52.191 --> 02:24:55.834]  They certainly have.
[02:24:55.854 --> 02:24:57.495]  Strange days have found us.
[02:24:59.116 --> 02:25:00.196]  They've tracked us down.
[02:25:02.498 --> 02:25:04.379]  We're talking to Vito Valente.
[02:25:05.322 --> 02:25:06.283]  And he is a survivor.
[02:25:06.323 --> 02:25:08.205]  William Rodriguez helped me get in touch with him.
[02:25:08.765 --> 02:25:14.810]  Willie's website has a link directly to donate directly to Vito Valente.
[02:25:14.850 --> 02:25:19.854]  If you go up to William911.com, there's a link at the bottom of the page to donate to help Vito.
[02:25:20.575 --> 02:25:26.880]  And Vito, are there any other ways that people can support you or help you and the folks that you're helping?
[02:25:27.721 --> 02:25:28.882]  Yes.
[02:25:29.182 --> 02:25:30.043]  Like I said, if you

[02:26:42.534 --> 02:26:48.937]  Well, I remember about three days into 9-11, and I thought about this, and I remember exactly who said it.
[02:26:48.997 --> 02:26:57.581]  Mark Quarantine was on this network at the time, and Mark said, listen, that dust is highly toxic, full of all this asbestos and chemicals.
[02:26:58.422 --> 02:26:59.462]  Don't send money.
[02:26:59.522 --> 02:27:00.543]  Don't send food.
[02:27:01.283 --> 02:27:02.944]  That's going to be stacked up to the rafters.
[02:27:03.104 --> 02:27:04.885]  Send breathing apparatus.
[02:27:05.425 --> 02:27:25.483]  And I got on air, and I, you know, had the biggest show on the network then, still do, so we sent, I don't know, just a mass load to some of the local churches that were smart enough, so within a week we had stuff going for the first responders, and for days they were just like, oh, the air is safe, breathe it, it's fun, but I mean, even people on this network knew it was deadly.
[02:27:26.366 --> 02:27:26.906]  Exactly.
[02:27:27.007 --> 02:27:32.930]  I mean, I mean, you know, you had to be there.
[02:27:33.191 --> 02:27:33.551]  You know what?
[02:27:33.571 --> 02:27:40.695]  The news and what everybody said on TV and in papers is nothing like you can't compare to what you what I've seen.
[02:27:40.856 --> 02:27:44.258]  Now, by the way, Giuliani was down there within hours and he was wearing a mask.
[02:27:44.458 --> 02:27:45.639]  Oh, yeah, he was wearing a mask.
[02:27:45.699 --> 02:27:46.159]  Exactly.
[02:27:46.599 --> 02:27:49.021]  And, you know, and they didn't give us nothing.
[02:27:49.677 --> 02:27:59.399]  And, you know, and his own guy, one of his own people, Washington, the guy, I believe his name is John Washington, he came down, he's sick now.
[02:27:59.999 --> 02:28:05.080]  Well, the EPA literally came down, though, within a day in space suits.
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:06.501]  Oh, yeah!
[02:28:06.601 --> 02:28:08.101]  I mean, they were in full body suits.
[02:28:08.121 --> 02:28:08.721]  Did you see those?
[02:28:08.761 --> 02:28:09.581]  I've seen photos.
[02:28:09.601 --> 02:28:13.162]  Yeah, I mean, they came down, I mean, the whole scene, they were, I mean,
[02:28:14.051 --> 02:28:19.375]  All the government officials that were there, they all had respirators and they had these big, big tanks.
[02:28:19.395 --> 02:28:19.935]  What about us?
[02:28:20.555 --> 02:28:21.336]  They didn't give us nothing.
[02:28:21.356 --> 02:28:23.377]  But meanwhile, they're telling you everything's fine.
[02:28:23.638 --> 02:28:24.938]  But everything, yeah, exactly.
[02:28:24.978 --> 02:28:27.300]  And open up schools 200 yards away, everything's fine.
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:31.723]  Well, the Stuyvesant High School that was right there, instead of evacuating the children,
[02:28:32.043 --> 02:28:35.865]  They told everybody, come on back into the school, the principal said.
[02:28:36.825 --> 02:28:39.226]  While they're wearing spacesuits, again that just proves it.
[02:28:39.706 --> 02:28:40.206]  Exactly.
[02:28:40.326 --> 02:28:43.368]  Now, any other tidbits of what we're going to see tomorrow?
[02:28:43.428 --> 02:28:44.188]  Any fireworks?
[02:28:44.568 --> 02:28:46.889]  Unless they edited it out.
[02:28:46.909 --> 02:28:52.011]  Well, like I said, on the show, you know, you're going to see myself and Bonnie Giffrey.
[02:28:52.031 --> 02:28:53.212]  She's an EMS worker.
[02:28:53.512 --> 02:28:55.092]  She was there on stage with us.
[02:28:55.132 --> 02:28:58.094]  It was me and her with Joy and Rosie.
[02:28:58.474 --> 02:29:01.015]  And in the audience, we had another responder.
[02:29:02.509 --> 02:29:06.475]  Alex Sanchez and Dr. Malone.
[02:29:06.555 --> 02:29:13.024]  What about the question of the government letting 9-11 happen, or government involvement, or how Building 7 fell down?
[02:29:13.044 --> 02:29:15.668]  Did you guys have any questions when that happened, how 7 fell?
[02:29:15.828 --> 02:29:16.990]  No, no we didn't.
[02:29:17.589 --> 02:29:17.769]  No.
[02:29:18.189 --> 02:29:19.669]  Do you now have any questions?
[02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:21.270]  No, no, nothing.
[02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:24.730]  I have nothing, no, nothing really to say on that.
[02:29:25.211 --> 02:29:27.511]  I know, but I'm sure you've heard people have questions.
[02:29:28.011 --> 02:29:37.613]  Yeah, I mean, everybody has their opinion, and you know, everybody has their different opinions, and to me, my main goal right now is to help the 9-11 responders.
[02:29:37.813 --> 02:29:42.334]  What do you think about, I mean, do you support Rosie's free speech when she was questioning the official story?
[02:29:43.315 --> 02:29:48.178]  Um, I can't really comment on that because I didn't really hear Rosie say that.
[02:29:48.559 --> 02:29:51.240]  I mean, all I can say is that the government hasn't
[02:29:58.525 --> 02:30:01.567]  Is not doing enough for us, the 9-11 responders.
[02:30:01.667 --> 02:30:02.168]  I understand.
[02:30:02.208 --> 02:30:03.089]  Vito Valente.
[02:30:03.549 --> 02:30:04.429]  Vito, we're out of time.
[02:30:04.470 --> 02:30:06.151]  I want to thank you for coming on with us, my friend.
[02:30:06.171 --> 02:30:06.991]  Thank you so much.
[02:30:07.432 --> 02:30:07.692]  You bet.
[02:30:07.712 --> 02:30:08.172]  God bless you.
[02:30:08.192 --> 02:30:08.973]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:30:08.993 --> 02:30:10.614]  God bless you guys and thank you so much.
[02:30:11.154 --> 02:30:12.816]  I mean, all you guys that are helping us.
[02:30:13.076 --> 02:30:14.837]  Well, we try to help everybody.
[02:30:14.857 --> 02:30:15.397]  That's what we do.
[02:30:15.417 --> 02:30:16.178]  God bless you, sir.
[02:30:18.760 --> 02:30:19.681]  We're on the march.
[02:30:20.141 --> 02:30:21.762]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:30:22.683 --> 02:30:25.385]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:28.817 --> 02:30:33.320]  Summer is once again just around the corner, and as usual, so are higher gas prices.
[02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:36.962]  This year, stop taking it on the chin and start fighting back.
[02:30:37.402 --> 02:30:45.127]  Ethos FR, a product tested and found worthy by NBC and Fox News, can save you up to 19% on fuel and reduce emissions by up to 30%.
[02:30:46.408 --> 02:30:52.992]  Unlike other products and gadgets you've seen advertised, Ethos FR attacks the source of the problem, unburned fuel.
[02:30:53.433 --> 02:30:57.155]  You see, exhaust is essentially unburned fuel that's expelled from your tailpipe.
[02:30:57.615 --> 02:31:02.439]  That equates to toxins being released into the environment and dollars being released from your wallet.
[02:31:02.859 --> 02:31:09.444]  But with Ethos FR, fuel burns more completely, helping your engine to deliver better mileage and helping you to save money.
[02:31:10.085 --> 02:31:11.686]  And it's so easy to use!
[02:31:12.146 --> 02:31:18.071]  Simply pour a couple of ounces into your tank at every fill-up and you're on your way to saving money and the environment.
[02:31:18.491 --> 02:31:24.875]  So, do yourself and the environment a favor and visit ctsavegas.com to get your bottle today.

[02:32:15.845 --> 02:32:20.787]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming and the end of the world?
[02:32:21.108 --> 02:32:22.988]  You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[02:32:23.189 --> 02:32:26.230]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:32:26.410 --> 02:32:29.552]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:32:29.852 --> 02:32:31.593]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:32:32.353 --> 02:32:35.734]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:32:35.934 --> 02:32:39.395]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:32:39.655 --> 02:32:42.916]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:32:42.936 --> 02:32:48.398]  The basic tenant of yeast in the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we see.
[02:32:48.438 --> 02:32:55.540]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like Cardivite, and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill, now going for regular jobs,
[02:32:55.660 --> 02:32:58.062]  A few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:32:58.203 --> 02:32:59.464]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:32:59.524 --> 02:33:05.450]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:33:05.490 --> 02:33:09.974]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:33:09.994 --> 02:33:11.336]  It'll work on other problems as well.
[02:33:11.536 --> 02:33:15.300]  For more information, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit our website at www.alex.com.

[02:33:23.105 --> 02:33:23.605]  1-877-928-8822.
[02:33:23.625 --> 02:33:47.374]  Let's go ahead, since we were just talking about Rudolph Giuliani, and play part of this eight-minute Keith Uberman piece to analyze it, break it down, while we play these clips.
[02:33:48.750 --> 02:33:52.533]  The full thing is up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:33:53.394 --> 02:33:57.757]  But right now, here is Keith Olbermann talking about Giuliani milking the 9-11 fear.
[02:33:58.678 --> 02:34:00.780]  Milking, basically engaging in terrorism.
[02:34:00.860 --> 02:34:02.962]  You know, vote for me or the terrorists will get you.
[02:34:05.124 --> 02:34:12.671]  Yeah, bottom line, they failed us, the defenses stood down like never before, they did a horrible job on 9-11, how are they heroes?
[02:34:13.372 --> 02:34:16.415]  Oberman at least goes that far, which I've been pointing out since day one.
[02:34:16.455 --> 02:34:18.337]  Not only did they fail us, they ran the whole thing.
[02:34:19.037 --> 02:34:19.698]  Here's Keith Oberman.
[02:34:20.296 --> 02:34:24.618]  A special comment about Rudolph Giuliani's remarks at a Lincoln Day dinner in New Hampshire last night.
[02:34:24.879 --> 02:34:38.366]  Since some indeterminable hour between the final dousing of the pyre at the World Trade Center and the breaking of what Senator Obama has aptly termed 9-11 fever, it has been profoundly and disturbingly evident that we are at the center of one of history's great ironies.
[02:34:39.046 --> 02:34:49.012]  Only in this America of the early 21st century could it be true that the man who was president during the worst attack on our nation, and the man who was the mayor of the city in which that attack principally unfolded,
[02:34:49.532 --> 02:34:57.757]  Would not only be absolved of any and all blame for the unreadiness of their own governments, but moreover, would thereafter be branded heroes of those attacks.
[02:34:58.498 --> 02:35:08.784]  And now that mayor, whose most profound municipal act in the wake of that nightmare was to suggest the postponement of the election to choose his own successor, has gone even a step beyond these M.C.
[02:35:08.904 --> 02:35:10.085]  Escher constructions of history.
[02:35:10.959 --> 02:35:21.503]  If any Republican is elected president, and I think obviously I would be best at this, we will remain on offense and we will anticipate what the terrorists will do and try to stop them before they do it.
[02:35:22.263 --> 02:35:26.605]  Insisting that the election of any Democrat would mean the country was back on defense.
[02:35:27.045 --> 02:35:33.187]  Mr. Giuliani continued last night, but the question is how long will it take and how many casualties will we have?
[02:35:33.727 --> 02:35:37.989]  If we were on defense, we will have more losses and it will go on longer.
[02:35:38.951 --> 02:35:44.054]  He said this with no sense of irony, no sense of any personal shortcomings, no sense whatsoever.
[02:35:44.954 --> 02:36:01.563]  And if you somehow missed what he was really saying, somehow did not hear the none-too-subtle subtext of vote Democratic and die, Mr. Giuliani then stripped away any barrier of courtesy, telling Roger Simon of Politico.com, quote, America will be safer with a Republican president.
[02:36:03.067 --> 02:36:19.321]  At least that Republican president, on which we have not been safer, has, even at his worst, maintained some microscopic distance between himself and a campaign platform that blithely threatened the American people with casualties if they, next year, elect a Democratic president.
[02:36:19.781 --> 02:36:25.446]  Or, inferring from Mr. Giuliani's flights of grandeur in New Hampshire last night, even if they elect a different Republican.
[02:36:26.426 --> 02:36:27.507]  How dare you, sir!
[02:36:28.008 --> 02:36:29.849]  How many casualties will we have?
[02:36:30.270 --> 02:36:31.871]  This is the language of Bin Laden!
[02:36:32.589 --> 02:36:51.321]  Yours, Mr. Giuliani, is the same chilling nonchalance of the madman, of the proselytizer, who has moved from even some crude framework of politics and society into a virtual Roman Colosseum of carnage and a conceit over your own ability and worthiness to decide who therein lives and who dies.
[02:36:52.101 --> 02:37:13.813]  Rather than a reasoned discussion, rather than a political campaign advocating your own causes and extolling your own qualifications, you have bypassed all the intermediate steps and moved directly to trying to terrorize the electorate into viewing a vote for a Democrat not as a reasonable alternative and an inalienable right, but as an act of suicide.
[02:37:14.972 --> 02:37:22.576]  This is not the mere politicizing of the war in Iraq, nor the vague mumbled epithets about democratic softness from a delusional vice president.
[02:37:23.116 --> 02:37:33.482]  This is casualties on a partisan basis of the naked assertion that Mr. Giuliani's party knows all and will save those who have voted for it and to hell with everybody else.
[02:37:34.443 --> 02:37:40.386]  And that he, with no foreign policy experience whatsoever, is somehow the messiah of the moment.
[02:37:41.554 --> 02:37:50.897]  Even to grant that that formula, whether posed by Republican or Democrat, is somehow not the most base, the most indefensible, the most un-American electioneering in our history.
[02:37:51.437 --> 02:37:56.899]  Even if it is somehow acceptable to assign casualties to one party and safety to the other.
[02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:07.363]  Even if we have become so profane in our thinking that it is part of our political vocabulary to view counter-terror as one party's property and the other's liability.
[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:12.441]  On what imaginary track record does Mr. Giuliani base his boast?
[02:38:13.381 --> 02:38:17.182]  Which party held the presidency on September 11, 2001, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:17.642 --> 02:38:20.802]  Which party held the mayoralty of New York on that date, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:21.142 --> 02:38:28.484]  Which party assured New Yorkers that the air was safe and the remains of the dead recovered and not being used to fill potholes, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:29.004 --> 02:38:33.324]  Which party wanted what the terrorists wanted, the postponement of our elections?
[02:38:33.764 --> 02:38:36.945]  And to whose personal advantage would that have redounded, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:37.569 --> 02:38:48.185]  Which mayor of New York was elected eight months after the first attack on the World Trade Center, yet did not emphasize counter-terror in that same city for the next eight years, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:48.917 --> 02:38:53.842]  Which party had proposed to turn over the Department of Homeland Security to Bernard Carrick, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:54.083 --> 02:38:58.848]  Who wanted to ignore and hide Carrick's organized crime allegations, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:38:59.348 --> 02:39:04.594]  Who personally argued to the White House that Carrick need not be vetted, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:05.155 --> 02:39:10.801]  Which party rode roughshod over Americans' rights while braying that it was actually protecting them, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:11.445 --> 02:39:18.687]  Which party took this country into the most utterly backwards, utterly counterproductive, utterly ruinous war in our history, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:19.207 --> 02:39:28.949]  Which party has been in office as more Americans were killed in the pointless fields of Iraq than were killed in the consuming nightmare of 9-11, Mr. Giuliani?
[02:39:29.609 --> 02:39:32.370]  Drop this argument, sir, you will lose it!
[02:39:34.443 --> 02:39:38.651]  The Democrats do not understand the full nature and scope of the terrorist war against us.
[02:39:39.131 --> 02:39:42.658]  Mr. Giuliani continued to the Rockingham County Lincoln Day dinner last night.
[02:39:43.437 --> 02:39:48.281]  Never ever again will this country be on defense waiting for terrorists to attack us.
[02:39:48.621 --> 02:39:51.643]  If I have any... We don't have time to play the last three minutes of it.
[02:39:51.683 --> 02:39:53.024]  Go to prisonplanet.com.
[02:39:53.044 --> 02:39:54.285]  You can watch it right now if you want.
[02:39:54.766 --> 02:39:55.867]  It gets even better, frankly.
[02:39:57.308 --> 02:40:01.791]  Sorry, Keith Elberman, you're just... I'm sorry, most people don't know what an M.C.
[02:40:02.291 --> 02:40:05.134]  Escher history is, but people might have seen the art.
[02:40:05.154 --> 02:40:10.738]  It's all three- and four-dimensional bizarre architectural structures that are like mirrors.
[02:40:11.622 --> 02:40:13.063]  One of my favorite artists growing up.
[02:40:13.123 --> 02:40:14.083]  I mean, it's a popular artist.
[02:40:14.103 --> 02:40:14.864]  Some of you may know him.
[02:40:15.244 --> 02:40:16.044]  Most people don't.
[02:40:16.445 --> 02:40:19.326]  Most people don't know how many continents there are or where Iraq is.
[02:40:19.606 --> 02:40:25.929]  Not my listeners, the general public, but I don't think your MSNBC audience got that Mr. Oberman there.
[02:40:26.830 --> 02:40:27.650]  Here's the problem, though.
[02:40:28.111 --> 02:40:29.491]  See, Democrats are going to save us.
[02:40:29.511 --> 02:40:30.832]  It's always the Democrats, the Democrats.
[02:40:32.227 --> 02:40:40.513]  When I start hearing him attack Hillary and Chuckie Schumer and Lieberman and all these warmongers, then I'll really fall down at the feet of Oberman.
[02:40:40.553 --> 02:40:41.634]  But obviously a genius.
[02:40:41.654 --> 02:40:42.995]  He's also great at calling baseball.
[02:40:43.896 --> 02:40:47.598]  Back when I had time to watch such things.
[02:40:47.618 --> 02:40:49.099]  That was like 12 years ago.
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:52.161]  But he's even better on sports.
[02:40:52.602 --> 02:40:53.682]  I mean, I'm sorry, Oberman.
[02:40:55.744 --> 02:40:57.945]  I'm sorry, but it's dangerous.
[02:40:57.985 --> 02:41:00.147]  See, it makes you think the solution is the Democrats.
[02:41:01.215 --> 02:41:02.256]  Everything he said is true.
[02:41:02.276 --> 02:41:05.179]  Now here it is in a laughing way from Jon Stewart.
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:08.602]  And don't forget to cut the little profanity comment at the end out.
[02:41:08.622 --> 02:41:13.366]  But here's Jon Stewart last night laying out in one of these debates with Bush against Bush.
[02:41:13.386 --> 02:41:13.767]  Here it is.
[02:41:14.788 --> 02:41:15.909]  So the battle lines are drawn.
[02:41:15.929 --> 02:41:18.671]  The Democrats are demanding a hard deadline for bringing our troops home.
[02:41:19.052 --> 02:41:20.533]  But have yet to move the President.
[02:41:21.053 --> 02:41:24.857]  And clearly their leadership might not be up to the task of convincing this President.
[02:41:25.512 --> 02:41:30.335]  But perhaps tonight, we have a gentleman who can face off with President Bush in a spirited debate.
[02:41:30.355 --> 02:41:34.237]  So first, we'd like to welcome to the program the President of the United States, George W. Bush.
[02:41:34.337 --> 02:41:34.517]  Sir?
[02:41:34.557 --> 02:41:36.358]  Thanks for the warm welcome, it's good to be here.
[02:41:36.378 --> 02:41:51.146]  Uh, sir, uh, nobody actually clapped, but, but... And to debate, uh, President Bush, a much more popular figure, first term, President George W. Bush.
[02:41:51.566 --> 02:41:54.348]  Good evening, I'm pleased to take your questions tonight.
[02:41:55.006 --> 02:41:55.606]  Wonderful news.
[02:41:55.706 --> 02:41:59.447]  Now, uh, Mr. Current President, let's start with you.
[02:41:59.667 --> 02:42:03.869]  More and more, people are saying you don't have the answers in Iraq.
[02:42:03.909 --> 02:42:06.269]  For four years, you've talked about progress that we're making.
[02:42:06.309 --> 02:42:07.250]  You continue to say that.
[02:42:07.290 --> 02:42:09.250]  When the Iraqis stand up, we will stand down.
[02:42:09.650 --> 02:42:11.611]  When are the troops coming home?
[02:42:12.631 --> 02:42:16.732]  Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work.
[02:42:17.693 --> 02:42:18.933]  First-term Bush, your response.
[02:42:19.373 --> 02:42:21.734]  This business about, you know, more time.
[02:42:23.357 --> 02:42:24.418]  How much time do we need?
[02:42:24.738 --> 02:42:26.099]  We have to be patient here.
[02:42:27.780 --> 02:42:31.342]  Actually, maybe President Bush has a point.
[02:42:32.303 --> 02:42:33.683]  Maybe we do need patience.
[02:42:33.723 --> 02:42:41.788]  First term Bush, you were asked to have patience, to give the inspections of diplomacy, time to work in Iraq before war.
[02:42:43.049 --> 02:42:43.950]  How did you respond?
[02:42:44.450 --> 02:42:48.793]  Saddam Hussein and his sons must leave Iraq within 48 hours.
[02:42:48.813 --> 02:42:48.873]  Wow.
[02:42:52.156 --> 02:42:52.656]  Deadlines.
[02:42:52.696 --> 02:42:53.177]  Tough talk.
[02:42:53.377 --> 02:42:54.517]  Mr. Second-Term President?
[02:42:55.197 --> 02:42:57.018]  It doesn't make any sense to have a timetable.
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:15.446]  So you don't think... You really... Second-Term Bush, you don't think a hard and fast deadline... We just need to give them some breathing space so they can gain their confidence and have the capabilities necessary to protect them.
[02:43:15.466 --> 02:43:18.588]  Surely we have learned how this man deceives and delays.
[02:43:19.948 --> 02:43:20.048]  He's...
[02:43:21.678 --> 02:43:23.118]  He's given people the runaround.
[02:43:23.378 --> 02:43:26.119]  Now, now, sir, I don't know if that's fair.
[02:43:26.599 --> 02:43:30.560]  I don't know if that's fair, sir.
[02:43:30.620 --> 02:43:33.980]  First-term Bush, why are you such a fan of these deadlines?
[02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:36.481]  The commitments we make must have meaning.
[02:43:36.521 --> 02:43:43.242]  When we say serious consequences for the sake of peace, there must be serious consequences.
[02:43:43.782 --> 02:43:47.243]  Alright, look, we're not getting anywhere here.
[02:43:47.283 --> 02:43:48.103]  Let's back up.
[02:43:48.383 --> 02:43:49.663]  First-term President Bush
[02:43:50.507 --> 02:43:52.748]  Why did we invade Iraq in the first place?
[02:43:53.149 --> 02:43:59.653]  The terrorist threat to America and the world will be diminished the moment that Saddam Hussein is disarmed.
[02:44:00.193 --> 02:44:03.355]  I see, so you wanted to protect America from the terrorist threat.
[02:44:03.875 --> 02:44:06.197]  Current President Bush, why can't we leave Iraq?
[02:44:06.837 --> 02:44:11.160]  Our enemies would have a safe haven from which to plan and launch attacks on the American people.
[02:44:14.853 --> 02:44:15.774]  So let me see if I have this straight.
[02:44:15.834 --> 02:44:20.318]  Basically, first term President Bush, you invaded to remove the threat of Saddam Hussein.
[02:44:20.778 --> 02:44:26.243]  And you, current President Bush, are there to battle the threat created by the lack of Saddam Hussein.
[02:44:26.303 --> 02:44:27.664]  Hmm.
[02:44:27.764 --> 02:44:29.405]  Okay.
[02:44:29.446 --> 02:44:34.650]  That's interesting.
[02:44:36.411 --> 02:44:39.474]  Basically, second term President Bush has to undo the damage.
[02:44:41.192 --> 02:44:42.893]  Created by first-term President Bush.
[02:44:42.913 --> 02:44:48.296]  First-term President Bush, any thoughts as you watch your future self prosecute this second part of the war?
[02:44:48.876 --> 02:44:54.759]  This looks like a rerun of a bad movie, and I'm not interested in watching it.
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:04.003]  And then he goes in to talk about how Al-Qaeda doesn't know the beauty and the fun of Hanukkah, and then he makes a joke about that.
[02:45:04.023 --> 02:45:09.106]  You can see the rest of it uncensored, I guess, up on PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[02:45:10.325 --> 02:45:11.547]  But, here's the problem.
[02:45:11.847 --> 02:45:12.688]  This is not funny.
[02:45:14.210 --> 02:45:16.192]  We have the U.S.
[02:45:16.352 --> 02:45:20.678]  and British studies, 600 plus thousand Iraqis.
[02:45:21.539 --> 02:45:22.740]  Now, that's the first three years.
[02:45:22.780 --> 02:45:26.925]  We're over four years and a month now, and the studies are starting to come in preliminary.
[02:45:26.945 --> 02:45:28.307]  It looks like it's over a mil now.
[02:45:29.733 --> 02:45:30.693]  Okay, that's not funny.
[02:45:31.054 --> 02:45:41.617]  But see, this is a comedy show, so the only place you can have serious information to point out lies and distortions and double-think and double-speak is on a comedy, or then on Keith Oberman, where it's all the Democrats are going to save us.
[02:45:45.359 --> 02:45:46.919]  That's the problem with all of this.
[02:45:47.099 --> 02:45:47.339]  No.
[02:45:47.699 --> 02:45:48.740]  Hillary is going to come in.
[02:45:48.760 --> 02:45:50.120]  She is a huge warmonger.
[02:45:51.361 --> 02:45:54.962]  So is the entire Democratic Party, except for just a couple Senators and House members.
[02:45:55.754 --> 02:46:00.636]  And those were saying they want to ban all the guns and you know basically have socialism and red stars everywhere.
[02:46:01.716 --> 02:46:02.197]  Literally!
[02:46:04.537 --> 02:46:10.080]  Which either they're either on the inside track or they're bleeding heart fools who don't know the banks finance the whole thing to consolidate power.
[02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:16.022]  We better have a crash course and grow up here or things are going to get progressively worse.
[02:46:16.042 --> 02:46:21.464]  Now I played those clips today because I was listening to talk radio this morning monitoring enemy transmissions of the fake neocons.
[02:46:22.202 --> 02:46:25.884]  And then I heard Bortz later driving over to the office, and it was all the same talking point.
[02:46:26.444 --> 02:46:29.265]  The front line in the battle against Al-Qaeda is Iraq.
[02:46:29.585 --> 02:46:31.626]  We've got to fight them there or they'll fight us over here.
[02:46:32.207 --> 02:46:37.329]  Excuse me, and excuse me, Saddam was anti-Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:38.049 --> 02:46:47.854]  But you see, Bortz kept saying that Al-Qaeda, you should have heard all of it, it was just such bull, folks.
[02:46:50.146 --> 02:46:54.009]  There was no Al-Qaeda in Iraq, and Bush said there was, and now that's admitted to be a lie.
[02:46:54.530 --> 02:47:00.575]  And anyone fighting back, anyone resisting of any of the factions, they then say is Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:01.375 --> 02:47:05.219]  I mean, basically, if the cops pull you over and you don't have an inspection sticker, it's going to be Al-Qaeda soon.
[02:47:05.699 --> 02:47:07.480]  You slip on a banana peel, it's Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:08.181 --> 02:47:09.062]  You got a stomachache?
[02:47:09.142 --> 02:47:10.523]  I must have eaten some bad Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:11.493 --> 02:47:13.355]  I'm not even trying to be joking about this.
[02:47:13.435 --> 02:47:15.098]  It's like the overhanging everything.
[02:47:15.438 --> 02:47:19.805]  Meanwhile, tiny four-way stops in the middle of the countryside have cameras.
[02:47:20.025 --> 02:47:21.347]  Tiny towns have cameras.
[02:47:22.464 --> 02:47:28.487]  And I was on Man Cow this morning, I don't agree with him on many things, syndicated show, but he did say, well, I guess I agree with you on the police state.
[02:47:28.527 --> 02:47:48.278]  He goes, you know, I drive through a really big industrial area, I see illegal aliens everywhere working at this big scrap factory, but there's cameras they put up now, and they make $100,000 a week off of it at the red light camera, you can't turn left on, excuse me, right on red, and like you could in the past, and I know they're making millions of dollars off of this.
[02:47:49.375 --> 02:47:53.237]  And, but then the illegal aliens, they won't stop and they're allowed to have bank accounts without ID cards.
[02:47:53.597 --> 02:47:55.778]  Exactly, because we're the schmoes that'll pay it.
[02:47:56.178 --> 02:47:58.059]  We're the dumb, dumb Americans.
[02:47:58.339 --> 02:48:00.080]  We really have to admit we're dumb.
[02:48:00.621 --> 02:48:05.283]  I mean, I've been ripped off and scammed before and I don't get mad at the people that even did it, I get mad at myself.
[02:48:05.803 --> 02:48:09.005]  Because then it won't happen again, or at least I'll have a better chance of it not happening again.
[02:48:09.985 --> 02:48:12.827]  But not here, no man, we just sit here and we take it.
[02:48:13.847 --> 02:48:15.468]  21 state police, last week I went to the beach.
[02:48:16.346 --> 02:48:17.626]  Twenty-one state police.
[02:48:18.146 --> 02:48:24.348]  Folks, I've gone five miles over the speed limit two times, and the state police have instantly pulled me over.
[02:48:25.108 --> 02:48:25.808]  Instantly!
[02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:33.230]  I mean, I got a ticket driving down there, and I'm going a few miles over the speed limit, and I'm like, you give him for just a few miles over, and he's like, yep, things have changed.
[02:48:33.650 --> 02:48:38.952]  You know, these yellow teeth, I was just looking at him, totally, he literally stunk through the window.
[02:48:39.932 --> 02:48:43.793]  And, I mean, I'm sorry, you stink, and this whole thing you're doing stinks.
[02:48:44.494 --> 02:48:47.278]  Well, there's illegal aliens all around me driving 90 miles an hour passes.
[02:48:47.298 --> 02:48:48.099]  I actually witnessed that.
[02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:50.602]  Another state police pulled me over.
[02:48:50.662 --> 02:48:54.387]  They want to start talking about grabbing our kids and looking at our safety seats and asking.
[02:48:54.407 --> 02:48:56.249]  And I just said, look, I'm a talk show host.
[02:48:56.309 --> 02:48:57.050]  I'm going to go after you.
[02:48:57.090 --> 02:48:57.551]  Leave me alone.
[02:48:57.591 --> 02:48:58.071]  Stop now.
[02:48:58.752 --> 02:49:01.015]  When they wanted to search the car and they kind of got the message and left.
[02:49:01.761 --> 02:49:03.302]  Plus, I turned up Coast to Coast AM.
[02:49:03.322 --> 02:49:04.142]  It was a rebroadcast.
[02:49:04.162 --> 02:49:06.484]  It was like 10 o'clock at night from me on the night before.
[02:49:06.964 --> 02:49:07.704]  And I go, you hear that?
[02:49:07.745 --> 02:49:08.125]  That's me.
[02:49:08.185 --> 02:49:08.905]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:49:08.925 --> 02:49:10.906]  I mean, that's the only time I use stuff like that.
[02:49:11.106 --> 02:49:12.167]  My finger's chopped off.
[02:49:12.347 --> 02:49:14.008]  The illegal aliens are all going in front of me.
[02:49:14.308 --> 02:49:18.851]  I start yelling, attach my finger, or I'm about to be harassed.
[02:49:18.931 --> 02:49:22.513]  I will say, look, you can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[02:49:22.553 --> 02:49:23.374]  I've told cops that.
[02:49:24.254 --> 02:49:27.556]  I said, I assure you, I'm going to legally hammer you.
[02:49:27.876 --> 02:49:29.237]  And I'm not a litigious person.
[02:49:30.629 --> 02:49:32.870]  Somebody started stalking my sister ten years ago.
[02:49:33.310 --> 02:49:34.110]  I sued them in one.
[02:49:34.530 --> 02:49:35.450]  Somebody stalked me.
[02:49:35.570 --> 02:49:36.310]  I sued them in one.
[02:49:36.510 --> 02:49:37.891]  They tried to shut down AXS TV.
[02:49:37.971 --> 02:49:38.731]  I sued them in one.
[02:49:38.771 --> 02:49:41.431]  In the process, the director went to prison, folks.
[02:49:41.891 --> 02:49:42.952]  He was caught stealing money.
[02:49:44.272 --> 02:49:45.352]  People slander me locally.
[02:49:45.432 --> 02:49:46.092]  I go into court.
[02:49:46.132 --> 02:49:47.373]  They want to settle and stop.
[02:49:47.693 --> 02:49:48.373]  Everything's fine.
[02:49:49.493 --> 02:49:56.855]  Some other locals want to snoop around into stuff and make up lies and want to claim and call people that I work for.
[02:49:57.135 --> 02:49:57.895]  Man, that's fine.
[02:49:58.556 --> 02:49:59.917]  That's how you get sued.
[02:49:59.977 --> 02:50:01.317]  And I mean, I don't understand it.
[02:50:01.357 --> 02:50:04.338]  It's not like I have a history of not doing what I say I'll do.
[02:50:05.059 --> 02:50:05.859]  I wasn't gonna do it.
[02:50:05.959 --> 02:50:06.459]  That's it.
[02:50:06.579 --> 02:50:07.280]  It's being filed.
[02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:11.561]  Uh, you know, this... I just can't take it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50:12.742 --> 02:50:14.503]  I've already digressed and gotten off into myself.
[02:50:19.244 --> 02:50:25.047]  I, um... I'm just mad.
[02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:31.102]  Because I do everything I do out of a pure heart and I just see the whole society degenerating.
[02:50:33.863 --> 02:50:37.584]  Do you think I like spending $10,000, $15,000 to sue somebody?
[02:50:38.904 --> 02:50:41.545]  Do you think I'm even glad the director of AXS TV went to prison?
[02:50:43.046 --> 02:50:44.826]  Do you think I like that?
[02:50:44.846 --> 02:50:45.787]  I want to make films.
[02:50:45.827 --> 02:50:46.727]  I want to have an effect.
[02:50:46.807 --> 02:50:47.727]  I want to do good.
[02:50:48.108 --> 02:50:50.848]  I want to have enough time to go help people at a soup kitchen.
[02:50:51.089 --> 02:50:51.969]  I like it!
[02:50:53.529 --> 02:50:55.050]  That's who I am, you scum!
[02:50:57.819 --> 02:50:58.639]  But I can't do that.
[02:50:58.939 --> 02:51:00.440]  I've got to defend myself.
[02:51:02.701 --> 02:51:04.462]  I want to go in the park and have a picnic.
[02:51:04.862 --> 02:51:05.362]  But I can't.
[02:51:07.023 --> 02:51:10.064]  I've got to sit here and watch this country completely unravel around me.
[02:51:12.425 --> 02:51:12.845]  Alright!
[02:51:16.667 --> 02:51:20.308]  Let me, uh... I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[02:51:20.348 --> 02:51:22.429]  I can try to jam you in or I can cover all this news.
[02:51:23.630 --> 02:51:24.550]  Oh God, we'll be back.
[02:51:31.465 --> 02:51:36.892]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:51:37.293 --> 02:51:44.943]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:51:45.618 --> 02:51:52.682]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:51:53.082 --> 02:52:04.488]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:52:04.808 --> 02:52:08.310]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:52:08.771 --> 02:52:10.692]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:52:11.032 --> 02:52:14.874]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:53:28.300 --> 02:53:30.001]  Hello friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:53:30.242 --> 02:53:33.944]  I want you to imagine waking up one morning to find out you've been burglarized.
[02:53:34.265 --> 02:53:43.191]  An intruder has taken your personal possessions, credit card numbers, social security cards, banking information, and more, all in the hands of a total stranger.
[02:53:43.351 --> 02:53:48.255]  What's worse is, you realize he got it through your front door because you left it unlocked.
[02:53:48.455 --> 02:53:57.402]  Every time you walk away from your computer, leaving your internet connection on, you are virtually inviting hackers, criminals, and Big Brother to access your personal information.
[02:53:57.802 --> 02:54:03.804]  Put a stop to this right now with the Net7 Network Security Switch from Net7 Technologies.

[02:54:31.733 --> 02:54:32.254]  I think so.
[02:54:56.513 --> 02:54:58.416]  I've sworn to stay the course.
[02:54:58.456 --> 02:55:01.961]  To ram the New World Order of Med Ships.
[02:55:14.211 --> 02:55:17.252]  And I am doing it.
[02:55:18.353 --> 02:55:22.114]  And I ask you to join me in this fight against the New World Order.
[02:55:22.975 --> 02:55:24.635]  And to never surrender!
[02:55:25.556 --> 02:55:27.237]  Never give one inch!
[02:55:27.277 --> 02:55:32.239]  Give them the cold steel of the Infowar!
[02:55:36.178 --> 02:55:36.699]  Alright.
[02:55:37.679 --> 02:55:38.580]  We're not going to go to calls today.
[02:55:38.600 --> 02:55:39.541]  I've got to cover all this.
[02:55:39.641 --> 02:55:41.363]  I don't even... I can't get to the Lou Dobbs either.
[02:55:41.823 --> 02:55:44.706]  Big clips up on PrisonPlanet.com of Lou Dobbs.
[02:55:46.446 --> 02:55:56.170]  With Pastor, the head CFR member, who wrote up the plan for North America that Bush signed into law two years ago as we're integrated, saying, oh, we're going to get rid of all the borders and have a continental security zone.
[02:55:56.530 --> 02:56:03.532]  Exactly what the UN Chief McKenzie, head of UN Peacekeeping, said the Wednesday after, a week plus after 9-11.
[02:56:03.652 --> 02:56:05.213]  What I keep telling you about.
[02:56:05.513 --> 02:56:06.893]  Continental security zone.
[02:56:07.114 --> 02:56:10.955]  We've got to have the North American Union for your security, or Al-Qaeda will get you.
[02:56:11.897 --> 02:56:12.317]  You know what?
[02:56:12.357 --> 02:56:13.037]  Play that clip.
[02:56:13.077 --> 02:56:13.918]  It's in the first minute.
[02:56:14.538 --> 02:56:15.298]  Just start playing.
[02:56:15.578 --> 02:56:17.699]  There's more of it later, but start playing the dobs.
[02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:24.322]  Border security is arguably the critical issue in this country's fight against radical Islamist terrorism.
[02:56:24.961 --> 02:56:32.609]  But our borders remain porous, so porous that 3 million illegal aliens entered this country last year, nearly all of them from Mexico.
[02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:46.243]  Now, incredibly, a panel sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations wants the United States to focus not on the defense of our own borders, but rather create what effectively would be a common border that includes Mexico and Canada.
[02:56:46.643 --> 02:56:48.125]  Christine Romans has the report.
[02:56:49.605 --> 02:56:59.109]  On Capitol Hill, testimony calling for Americans to start thinking like citizens of North America and treat the U.S., Mexico, and Canada like one big country.
[02:56:59.409 --> 02:57:08.093]  The best way to secure the United States today is not at our two borders with Mexico and Canada, but at the borders of North America as a whole.
[02:57:08.593 --> 02:57:10.794]  That's the view in a report called Building a North America.
[02:57:11.651 --> 02:57:12.651]  It just goes on and on.
[02:57:13.091 --> 02:57:14.632]  But no, there's no North American Union.
[02:57:16.732 --> 02:57:18.973]  I've got all these neocon sites saying I'm a big liar.
[02:57:19.353 --> 02:57:20.653]  I mean, I just can't believe it.
[02:57:21.833 --> 02:57:25.394]  Watch, they're going to say gun control is conservative and O'Reilly's calling for it.
[02:57:25.714 --> 02:57:27.535]  And I tell you, I told you it happened.
[02:57:27.595 --> 02:57:29.515]  Now we're evil because we don't want to hand our guns in.
[02:57:29.995 --> 02:57:36.637]  Folks, they can tell them putting red hammer and sickles on their armband is conservative, and these so-called conservatives will do it, okay?
[02:57:36.657 --> 02:57:38.037]  Do you understand how bad they are?
[02:57:39.722 --> 02:57:40.884]  Absolute trash.
[02:57:40.944 --> 02:57:42.426]  And here's all the other news we didn't get to.
[02:57:43.808 --> 02:57:46.332]  Fellow Ranger ordered a concealed truth about Tillman's death.
[02:57:46.392 --> 02:57:48.014]  I just thought I'd mention that, Associated Press.
[02:57:48.034 --> 02:57:54.564]  Another one about Jessica Linchman public saying in a testimony it was all lies and propaganda and she was told a lie.
[02:57:55.339 --> 02:57:58.981]  And then that integrates in with Pentagon wants to end controversial spying program.
[02:57:59.541 --> 02:58:01.902]  It's been in place forever, for 50 years.
[02:58:02.042 --> 02:58:02.942]  It's not going away.
[02:58:03.142 --> 02:58:04.263]  That's Pentagon lies, okay?
[02:58:04.283 --> 02:58:05.883]  We just want you to know they're pure liars.
[02:58:06.143 --> 02:58:10.085]  And by the way, all the evidence shows they killed Pat Tillman on purpose because he was about to come out against the war.
[02:58:11.646 --> 02:58:12.347]  U.S.
[02:58:12.407 --> 02:58:19.990]  officials exclude car bombs in a touting drop in Iraq violence, so they cut out all the truck bombs and don't count that until you deaths have gone down.
[02:58:20.910 --> 02:58:21.791]  Total lies!
[02:58:22.251 --> 02:58:23.391]  McClatchy newspapers.
[02:58:23.751 --> 02:58:27.333]  Bin Laden overseeing Iraq-Afghanistan ops and the Taliban.
[02:58:27.693 --> 02:58:29.354]  I mean, this guy basically runs everything.
[02:58:31.209 --> 02:58:32.150]  We're out of time here.
[02:58:32.510 --> 02:58:37.613]  This is the Wall Street Journal about how the government could control the weather and stop global warming.
[02:58:37.653 --> 02:58:39.214]  Folks, they've been doing it since the 60s.
[02:58:39.514 --> 02:58:40.995]  We've had the father of weather weapons on.
[02:58:41.035 --> 02:58:43.737]  Big article on Prison Planet and Infowars coming up later today.
[02:58:44.237 --> 02:58:46.899]  China to force rain ahead of Olympics, that's Associated Press.
[02:58:47.579 --> 02:58:50.361]  Industry caught with the global tax for carbon as a fraud.
[02:58:51.062 --> 02:58:53.883]  Nothing to do with stopping global warming, folks, even if you believe it's man-made.
[02:58:54.184 --> 02:58:54.784]  It does nothing.
[02:58:55.504 --> 02:58:56.205]  Compute that.
[02:58:57.274 --> 02:59:04.576]  And please get the Rosie O'Donnell scoop, major breaking, all the behind the scenes, how she was censored, why she left, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:59:04.757 --> 02:59:05.657]  God bless you all!
[02:59:05.737 --> 02:59:06.717]  Gotta go file a lawsuit!
[02:59:08.018 --> 02:59:12.899]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[02:59:18.701 --> 02:59:21.862]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:59:21.902 --> 02:59:25.943]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:59:26.063 --> 02:59:28.624]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:59:28.704 --> 02:59:31.024]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:59:31.205 --> 02:59:39.647]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:59:39.727 --> 02:59:41.027]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:59:41.167 --> 02:59:47.169]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:59:47.349 --> 02:59:49.957]  This allows the proprietary media formulation.
