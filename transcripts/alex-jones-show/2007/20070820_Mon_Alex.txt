[00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:06.526]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.186 --> 00:00:08.227]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.108]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:11.549]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.210]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.871 --> 00:00:17.654]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.157]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.582]  Our traitorous president is right outside of Ottawa.
[00:00:33.215 --> 00:00:40.918]  Monticello up there, violating everyone's freedom and liberties with the troops out there, blocking anyone from getting into the internal sector.
[00:00:40.938 --> 00:00:55.963]  The 18-mile control perimeter, Dr. Jerome Corsi is going to be attempting to go through the picket line in one hour from now, live on this broadcast from his rental car.
[00:00:57.142 --> 00:01:03.925]  He has multiple press passes, best-selling author, writes for a publication that has at least 12 million readers per month, World Net Daily.
[00:01:04.265 --> 00:01:12.428]  They have refused him even a pass to get within the city itself in Montebello.
[00:01:15.089 --> 00:01:15.870]  Unprecedented.
[00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:26.254]  And even if you get press passes, there is just two little press conferences that you're allowed to attend where they come out of the secret meetings and then shovel propaganda on you.
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.782]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:48.635]  Then in the third hour, James Arie, who is the lawyer for the victim's families, who are calling for a new investigation and saying there could be a cover-up in what really happened on the London bombings two years ago in July.
[00:01:49.916 --> 00:01:57.962]  So that is coming up, and I want to give you a chance to respond to the high treason of President Bush
[00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:09.476]  of the Prime Minister of Canada and the Mexican President up there engaging in their attempt to set up the North American Union at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:09.596 --> 00:02:25.045]  Dean has, after narrowly missing Jamaica, has now turned with more of a southerly course into the Yucatan Peninsula.
[00:02:26.394 --> 00:02:32.044]  And is now reportedly going to be going into the mainland of Mexico.
[00:02:33.246 --> 00:02:34.928]  They're off of its eastern coastline.
[00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:39.776]  Not good for the Mexicans, but very good for Texans and Louisianans.
[00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:47.937]  We've had a little bit too much fun with hurricanes the last few years, so that is certainly good news for us here in the States.
[00:02:48.097 --> 00:02:56.404]  And the area of Mexico it's scheduled to slam into in the next day is also not very populated compared to Houston, New Orleans.
[00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.891]  But I'm already getting off into being a weatherman.
[00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:06.576]  The point is also, crude oil prices dropped substantively, so did natural gas today.
[00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:19.325]  On news that it wasn't going to be barreling through the middle of the Gulf, wrecking the extraction centers that then pump it to Houston for refining both the natural gas and of course the crude oil off the seafloor.
[00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:23.969]  So that is certainly some good news there.
[00:03:24.642 --> 00:03:32.207]  And I'll be honest with you, I'm scheduled to take the children down to the beach for a couple days this weekend, and of course a hurricane appeared out of nowhere to ruin that.
[00:03:32.627 --> 00:03:33.268]  Murphy's Law.
[00:03:33.848 --> 00:03:35.709]  But now it looks like that is not the case.
[00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.530]  So that certainly is some good news.
[00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.691]  We have finished Endgame.
[00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:52.980]  I left here at about 11 o'clock last night, and they were having trouble printing it, because when you make something in HD, it just creates all sorts of new problems.
[00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:57.033]  Without, you know, having any audio drops or any video drops.
[00:03:57.113 --> 00:03:58.634]  Any little tiny bumps.
[00:04:00.075 --> 00:04:02.417]  And I just pulled up ten minutes before show time.
[00:04:02.457 --> 00:04:03.398]  I got ready at my house.
[00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:08.162]  And there was Aaron Dykes printing copies.
[00:04:08.202 --> 00:04:10.624]  They finally got a good copy printed just a few minutes ago.
[00:04:11.104 --> 00:04:15.208]  Starting another direct dump onto the DVC Pro deck.
[00:04:19.191 --> 00:04:21.793]  Because the first DVD we're putting out is not going to be high definition.
[00:04:22.612 --> 00:04:24.032]  Most people don't have that, so we're printing it.
[00:04:24.312 --> 00:04:27.193]  DVC Pro to be put on DVD, and HD.
[00:04:29.514 --> 00:04:33.695]  I guess HD is the, uh... Oh, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:33.735 --> 00:04:36.075]  The point is, this sucker is done.
[00:04:36.876 --> 00:04:40.937]  Now I gotta build a website for it, do the cover, do a write-up on it.
[00:04:40.957 --> 00:04:43.837]  I always make the film and don't promote it.
[00:04:44.137 --> 00:04:44.858]  That's the problem.
[00:04:45.258 --> 00:04:46.638]  I'm gonna try to follow through on this one.
[00:04:47.138 --> 00:04:48.158]  Too much work on it, and...
[00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:54.191]  But these are good men, Aaron Dyches and Rob Jacobson.
[00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:57.879]  They really deserve incredible credit on endgame.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.184]  Over and above the call of duty.
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:11.727]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:23.215]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:29.260]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.143]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:05:36.363 --> 00:05:43.186]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:05:43.466 --> 00:05:45.227]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:05:45.487 --> 00:05:47.688]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements Kit.
[00:05:47.728 --> 00:05:48.029]  We're good.
[00:06:04.588 --> 00:06:10.074]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:06:10.435 --> 00:06:18.063]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:06:18.757 --> 00:06:25.818]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:06:26.218 --> 00:06:37.640]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:41.881]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.821]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:06:44.181 --> 00:06:48.022]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:06:48.622 --> 00:07:00.569]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:01.329 --> 00:07:08.814]  I'm Dr. Arthur Perry and I'm a plastic surgeon and I see a lot of people who come to my office for facelifts and collagen injections.
[00:07:08.974 --> 00:07:11.475]  But I want to tell you today about a product that I developed.
[00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:16.478]  It's called Night Skin and it helps your skin look younger without needles, without acid peels,
[00:07:16.758 --> 00:07:17.158]  We're good to go!
[00:07:47.038 --> 00:07:49.178]  To order Nightskin wrist-free, call 1-800-894-3462.
[00:07:49.198 --> 00:07:50.759]  Learn how to get a free bottle by responding to this ad.
[00:07:50.799 --> 00:07:51.019]  Call 1-800-894-3462.
[00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:51.319]  That's 1-800-894-3462.
[00:07:51.359 --> 00:07:54.480]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:55.720]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.425 --> 00:08:24.853]  Connie Fogel, Canadian Action Party, there, on the ground, in Canada.
[00:08:26.875 --> 00:08:29.178]  We'll be popping in later in the second hour.
[00:08:29.198 --> 00:08:33.302]  So will Dr. Jerome Corsi, there in the police state, Cordon.
[00:08:33.882 --> 00:08:38.307]  He will be joining us from the ground, either in Ottawa.
[00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:53.079]  But if he's able to make it across the bridge there and get into the French area, the French sector in Montebello, Quebec, then we will be able to get a report up close.
[00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:57.663]  But the police state is so egregious that we're not sure if he'll make it through.
[00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:02.446]  It has been confirmed that they are randomly stopping people, searching them.
[00:09:02.866 --> 00:09:07.049]  There are police, there are military, there are all mounted police, there are helicopters.
[00:09:08.091 --> 00:09:18.379]  It is just a huge spectacle as the leaders meet in secret, but last year we were able to get through FOIA request and then a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch to force the issue.
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:22.282]  The documents, and I know I parrot this continually, but it's a big deal.
[00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:34.752]  We got the smoking gun documents, hundreds and hundreds of pages, I read them all, it's in Endgame, it's in the late great USA, and they say, secret stealth approach to North American integration.
[00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:39.918]  North American integration of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
[00:09:40.558 --> 00:09:42.099]  That is the North American Union.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:49.103]  And then Pasteur in the CFR writes up a plan that was adopted towards a North American community.
[00:09:49.624 --> 00:09:53.006]  Just like they first called the EU, the European Community.
[00:09:54.547 --> 00:09:59.510]  You see, first it was an economic trade deal, then a community, then European Union.
[00:10:00.313 --> 00:10:26.148]  And you'd think they were around just since 2000, when the world was told, okay, we're a union, but just this year they had the 50th anniversary to celebrate 1957 and the Treaty of Rome, signed in secret, which just two years ago got released, and the architect of it's memoirs are now out, and they talk about how they kept it secret from the people, and how they set it up.
[00:10:27.407 --> 00:10:30.409]  But everything now is accelerated.
[00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:45.900]  Now the European Union really started in 49 with the Treaty of London headed up by Sir Winston Churchill, but it didn't get codified in secret to be a true union until 57 with the Treaty of Rome.
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:49.382]  But still, I actually read the Treaty of Rome.
[00:10:49.402 --> 00:10:51.123]  It's hundreds of pages long.
[00:10:51.143 --> 00:10:51.704]  Why don't you go read it?
[00:10:52.144 --> 00:10:53.345]  I'm challenging you to.
[00:10:54.325 --> 00:10:56.407]  And then go read the memoirs of those that put it together.
[00:10:58.473 --> 00:11:01.657]  And then the media has the nerve to say it doesn't exist.
[00:11:01.697 --> 00:11:03.278]  In fact, I will go over this today.
[00:11:03.298 --> 00:11:06.081]  I didn't have time on the two-hour show.
[00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:08.003]  Yesterday I do on Sundays from 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:11:08.043 --> 00:11:08.404]  Central.
[00:11:10.967 --> 00:11:12.328]  Big article by this R.G.
[00:11:12.408 --> 00:11:19.456]  Ratcliffe, front page of the Houston Chronicle, the big paper here in Texas, front page of their website.
[00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.934]  And he opened it up saying, Black Helicopters, Illuminati, and the North American Union.
[00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:27.096]  It was just a big joke.
[00:11:27.236 --> 00:11:28.997]  Oh, we believe it exists.
[00:11:29.037 --> 00:11:29.678]  We're crazy.
[00:11:31.179 --> 00:11:38.325]  But, he does at least admit the Bilderberg Group is real and that Perry went to it and it was secret.
[00:11:38.785 --> 00:11:40.707]  But he says, oh, that's really no big deal.
[00:11:42.407 --> 00:11:52.116]  Well, I challenge people to remember Rush Limbaugh, the New York Times, all of them, saying five years ago, ten years ago, fifteen years ago, Bilderberg doesn't exist.
[00:11:52.196 --> 00:11:54.438]  It's a code word for racism.
[00:11:54.959 --> 00:12:04.388]  They have government training manuals and ADL manuals and Southern Barbary Law Center manuals that say, if you hear the word Bilderberg, it's code for white supremacy.
[00:12:05.191 --> 00:12:07.173]  And then you're like, no, no, Bilderberg runs the planet!
[00:12:07.193 --> 00:12:07.853]  Please, I'm warning you!
[00:12:08.053 --> 00:12:08.794]  Oh my gosh!
[00:12:09.154 --> 00:12:09.995]  Oh my gosh!
[00:12:10.375 --> 00:12:15.739]  We've even got videos of cops pulling people over and they find literature about it and they go, look, they've got it!
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.283]  It says here, posse comitatus, that's that code for racism!
[00:12:22.004 --> 00:12:27.128]  And then now we can play newscast and, the government's now gotten rid of posse comitatus and will use the military against the people!
[00:12:27.789 --> 00:12:29.050]  No, it was a law!
[00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.551]  It's Latin!
[00:12:34.159 --> 00:12:36.402]  Dealing with the posse.
[00:12:36.842 --> 00:12:39.465]  Restrictions on federal posses.
[00:12:42.007 --> 00:12:43.989]  A posse is a group.
[00:12:45.811 --> 00:12:46.532]  It's a militia.
[00:12:47.213 --> 00:12:48.014]  You go to its root.
[00:12:49.575 --> 00:12:50.777]  I'm no student of Latin.
[00:12:50.797 --> 00:12:51.798]  Let me double-check that.
[00:12:51.818 --> 00:12:52.539]  I'm going from memory.
[00:12:52.939 --> 00:12:55.662]  But the point is, we know what a posse is.
[00:13:02.657 --> 00:13:03.678]  Here's just some of the news.
[00:13:03.718 --> 00:13:05.058]  This is AP today.
[00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.600]  Bush seeks to boost Canada-Mexico ties.
[00:13:09.341 --> 00:13:11.122]  Well, I fought with NAFTA back in 94.
[00:13:11.182 --> 00:13:12.503]  We did free trade, open borders.
[00:13:13.824 --> 00:13:15.044]  We've seen the jobs disappear.
[00:13:15.104 --> 00:13:16.725]  Great sucking sound, as we were told.
[00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:20.507]  Well, what's the new tie?
[00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:22.308]  Well, it's military regulations.
[00:13:22.669 --> 00:13:23.749]  It's taxing.
[00:13:23.809 --> 00:13:25.010]  It's legalism.
[00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:28.072]  I mean, I've got news here where they just finally opened the roads up to the trucks.
[00:13:28.092 --> 00:13:30.173]  They've already been here for years, but now it's like unlimited.
[00:13:31.534 --> 00:13:33.695]  Bush seeks to boost Canada-Mexico ties.
[00:13:33.735 --> 00:13:43.341]  President Bush, tending to relationships with two border nations, will try to give a boost money to his partnerships with the like-minded leaders of Canada and Mexico.
[00:13:43.361 --> 00:13:55.468]  You know, they tried to get NAFTA through as a treaty, but you had to have two-thirds, so they just said, well, we'll have a new kind of treaty that we call a partnership, the NAFTA Agreement Partnership.
[00:13:57.229 --> 00:13:59.550]  And it's got the power of a treaty, but it's not a treaty.
[00:14:01.067 --> 00:14:02.707]  See, it's all color of law now.
[00:14:03.648 --> 00:14:11.209]  Oh, we say we're going to take you to jail with no due process.
[00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:14.090]  We say we're going to take your children if they don't take vaccines.
[00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:16.470]  There's no law, but we got guns!
[00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:18.690]  We say.
[00:14:20.671 --> 00:14:22.851]  Rob, here at the office, got no ticket.
[00:14:25.032 --> 00:14:26.552]  And, uh, but they took down his info.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.962]  And he just got a... Because he argued with a cop.
[00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:37.964]  He just got a points ticket, but it's not a ticket.
[00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:42.407]  No judge, no jury, no court, no recourse.
[00:14:42.867 --> 00:14:45.549]  It says $250 for not having insurance.
[00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:48.590]  I don't know, it's out there in the office.
[00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:51.332]  It says no insurance or... Oh, yeah.
[00:14:51.672 --> 00:14:54.994]  No insurance or driving with a suspended license.
[00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:56.615]  It's a form letter.
[00:14:56.975 --> 00:14:58.776]  It says you either did this or you either did that.
[00:14:59.454 --> 00:15:01.115]  There's no number, there's no nothing.
[00:15:01.175 --> 00:15:03.995]  It's pay up or we turn your driver's license off.
[00:15:04.956 --> 00:15:11.438]  And in the future, you're not going to live without that because you're going to be swiping that federal ID, that's what it is, standardized, to buy and sell.
[00:15:11.518 --> 00:15:11.798]  Why?
[00:15:11.818 --> 00:15:14.459]  Because Neal Bortz is telling you you need a national sales tax.
[00:15:16.119 --> 00:15:17.239]  But it's going to be graduated.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:23.441]  For people that make less than $15,000 a year, you're not going to pay any tax on that.
[00:15:24.962 --> 00:15:25.602]  Heaven help us.
[00:15:26.627 --> 00:15:28.088]  Heaven help us.
[00:15:28.108 --> 00:15:29.409]  But I'm already digressing.
[00:15:29.469 --> 00:15:32.990]  It's just complete color of law, complete lawlessness now.
[00:15:33.831 --> 00:15:36.072]  The dam has broken, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:39.134 --> 00:15:42.555]  I have two articles a day of them CPS-ing children that didn't take vaccines.
[00:15:42.696 --> 00:15:43.116]  No law.
[00:15:45.637 --> 00:15:47.438]  I had a call yesterday on the radio about it.
[00:15:48.919 --> 00:15:51.080]  It's just, it's just hell has been released.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.521]  Bush seeks to boost Canada-Mexico ties.
[00:15:58.141 --> 00:16:07.244]  Bush's two-day summit with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Bilderberg member I would add, and Mexican President Felipe Calderon is the third of its kind during his presidency.
[00:16:07.364 --> 00:16:16.647]  Each has been meant to bolster an evolving compact dubbed the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America.
[00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:18.808]  Oh, a compact!
[00:16:20.048 --> 00:16:22.069]  Like the Magna Carta, or the
[00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.980]  Louisiana Purchase was a compact.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.341]  See, that's a compact!
[00:16:26.641 --> 00:16:27.481]  It means something.
[00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:30.042]  But when you resist it, they say it doesn't exist.
[00:16:30.443 --> 00:16:34.505]  And that is a military tactic, because even if you know they're lying, it still takes you back.
[00:16:34.565 --> 00:16:38.206]  It's like, it's like you catch somebody robbing your house, and they just smile at you.
[00:16:38.427 --> 00:16:39.727]  You start pushing them, saying, hey, stop.
[00:16:39.787 --> 00:16:40.408]  I'll call the police.
[00:16:40.428 --> 00:16:41.508]  They're like, hello, friend.
[00:16:41.708 --> 00:16:42.148]  Hello, friend.
[00:16:42.168 --> 00:16:43.209]  They start trying to kiss you.
[00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:46.211]  It would throw you off.
[00:16:46.371 --> 00:16:49.772]  Or they started, like, acting like a clown, going, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:49.792 --> 00:16:51.073]  You know, getting in their car and driving off.
[00:16:51.273 --> 00:16:52.974]  You'd probably just stand back and go, you're weird.
[00:16:53.621 --> 00:16:57.523]  We have all their documents, all their admissions, they're doing it, and they just go, doesn't exist!
[00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:01.425]  And then they announce it exists, and then you go, I don't want it, and you go, doesn't exist!
[00:17:02.026 --> 00:17:02.886]  Just like amnesty.
[00:17:03.867 --> 00:17:05.668]  I know a lot of conservatives are still fooled.
[00:17:06.008 --> 00:17:09.390]  I hear them on talk radio going, well, it was kind of an amnesty.
[00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.010]  Kind of an amnesty!
[00:17:11.211 --> 00:17:13.492]  Go read the bill, you lazy people!
[00:17:14.592 --> 00:17:18.555]  It was five-year no-income tax pardon.
[00:17:19.175 --> 00:17:21.116]  It was aggravated MS-13.
[00:17:21.256 --> 00:17:22.857]  It's even said
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.543]  Aggravated felons are instantly legalized.
[00:17:30.166 --> 00:17:32.268]  I mean, you can't make this type stuff up.
[00:17:32.408 --> 00:17:35.491]  It was 50 times worse than amnesty.
[00:17:36.952 --> 00:17:43.318]  You can't even get conservatives or the general public to admit it's amnesty, because they cannot believe the lie.
[00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:47.182]  I get calls, emails every day, well is it really amnesty?
[00:17:47.262 --> 00:17:48.483]  Are you making that up?
[00:17:49.315 --> 00:17:52.976]  I just read the subsections of the bill about 50 times here on air.
[00:17:53.216 --> 00:17:54.337]  I just read the bill.
[00:17:55.117 --> 00:17:57.878]  Senator Sessions put it out, leaked it when he wasn't supposed to.
[00:17:58.198 --> 00:17:59.018]  Let me give you a tip.
[00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:08.621]  When they tell you a bill is secret and to just trust them, you better cover your hind end because they're going to try something.
[00:18:10.482 --> 00:18:11.582]  Look, I'm already digressing.
[00:18:11.942 --> 00:18:13.723]  I just can't handle it anymore.
[00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.304]  It's to the point of where they're mailing people
[00:18:17.563 --> 00:18:19.727]  Demands for money when there's no ticket.
[00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:24.575]  It's getting to the point where they're grabbing children everywhere when there's no law.
[00:18:26.098 --> 00:18:27.280]  It's getting to the point where
[00:18:28.368 --> 00:18:36.233]  I hear these radio ads all over the place going, you are getting tough with checkpoints to stop your drinking and to look for drugs and guns.
[00:18:36.633 --> 00:18:41.836]  We're cracking down on you and huge billboards of cops staring at you like it's Big Brother.
[00:18:42.256 --> 00:18:47.499]  And then I got mayors on video going, well I don't, we don't arrest illegals for DWIs.
[00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:53.543]  I got AP where they don't have to have any ID for bank loans.
[00:18:55.473 --> 00:19:00.314]  And the cops all admit it's true, and they just tell us, well, doesn't matter, I've been told to enforce on you.
[00:19:01.994 --> 00:19:04.755]  I mean, again, it's completely lawless.
[00:19:05.395 --> 00:19:06.215]  And I'm sick of it!
[00:19:09.075 --> 00:19:09.896]  I'm already digressing.
[00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:11.956]  When we get back, I'm going to cover what's happening up in Canada.
[00:19:15.436 --> 00:19:19.177]  Congress tells Bush, back off of SPP agenda.
[00:19:19.457 --> 00:19:24.078]  Lawmakers' letter warns stealth effort to harmonize could undermine security.
[00:19:26.629 --> 00:19:41.898]  22 members of the House of Representatives, 21 Republicans and a Democrat are urging President Bush to back off his North American integration efforts when he attends the third summit meeting on the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America right now in Montebello, Quebec.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:50.904]  They make it clear that continuing any such agenda to this point would be disregarding growing apprehension in Congress about the plans.
[00:19:51.704 --> 00:19:53.145]  Bush's answer doesn't exist.
[00:19:53.829 --> 00:19:56.971]  We're going to come back, cover this article and a lot more, and take your calls.
[00:19:57.292 --> 00:19:57.792]  Stay with me.
[00:20:01.895 --> 00:20:07.119]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:20:07.259 --> 00:20:15.365]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:20:15.605 --> 00:20:22.650]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:24.110]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:30.071]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:20:30.271 --> 00:20:35.352]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:20:35.472 --> 00:20:44.354]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:20:44.614 --> 00:20:47.895]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[00:20:53.036 --> 00:21:06.938]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:21:07.338 --> 00:21:12.759]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:21:13.219 --> 00:21:14.299]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:21:14.339 --> 00:21:18.380]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:32.373]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:21:32.393 --> 00:21:38.198]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:21:38.458 --> 00:21:44.344]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:21:45.085 --> 00:21:46.887]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.949 --> 00:21:51.114]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[00:21:51.554 --> 00:21:52.155]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:52.195 --> 00:21:54.358]  Exercise your legal rights to trade metals privately.
[00:21:54.378 --> 00:21:54.439]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:03.172 --> 00:22:05.694]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:06.374 --> 00:22:16.001]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[00:22:17.022 --> 00:22:26.529]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:33.084]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[00:22:33.864 --> 00:22:41.592]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:44.215 --> 00:22:44.555]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:52.125 --> 00:22:52.746]  516-8736.
[00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:57.270]  Call now.
[00:22:57.430 --> 00:23:01.094]  Operators are standing by to take your order for a free subscription.
[00:23:03.775 --> 00:23:05.836]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:23:06.456 --> 00:23:15.378]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:23:15.818 --> 00:23:23.020]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:23:23.749 --> 00:23:29.235]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.
[00:23:29.735 --> 00:23:40.566]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy skin cancer and breast tumors of any size without adverse side effects at our physician's office.
[00:23:41.307 --> 00:23:43.329]  Laser technology at its best.

[00:23:46.712 --> 00:23:47.033]  Call 702-953-0267.
[00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:19.138]  Twenty-two members of the U.S.
[00:24:19.178 --> 00:24:30.144]  House of Representatives, Republicans and Democrats, are urging President Bush to back off his North American integration efforts when he attends the third
[00:24:31.392 --> 00:24:32.072]  We're good to go.
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:57.185]  And he is going to be driving over back through the security cordon when he joins us in about 37 minutes from now.
[00:24:57.605 --> 00:24:59.767]  Connie Fogle will also be joining us.
[00:24:59.807 --> 00:25:01.908]  She's trying to get through the security cordon.
[00:25:02.729 --> 00:25:08.332]  Art Hammond will be also popping in.
[00:25:08.673 --> 00:25:15.097]  He's recommended by Dr. Corsi as well to give us a report on what's going on up there.
[00:25:15.117 --> 00:25:18.139]  We're going to come back in the next segment and take your calls on this.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.701]  Is being committed, but it's being committed everywhere.
[00:25:22.721 --> 00:25:24.282]  I mean, they've gotten rid of Posse Comitatus.
[00:25:25.462 --> 00:25:26.843]  Now, it doesn't mean it's really gone.
[00:25:27.203 --> 00:25:33.306]  They can claim that they're dictators in God, and they can have the Attorney General write memos saying that, but that isn't the case.
[00:25:33.626 --> 00:25:35.046]  They can claim the Fourth Amendment's gone.
[00:25:36.447 --> 00:25:38.728]  They can claim the Pentagon can spy on the American people.
[00:25:39.688 --> 00:25:42.410]  They can claim that they can steal $4 trillion from the Pentagon.
[00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:45.551]  They can claim that they can attack sovereign innocent nations.
[00:25:46.368 --> 00:25:50.951]  They can claim that they can arrest you for your speech or ban free speech, but that isn't the case.
[00:25:51.111 --> 00:25:55.274]  We're going to stand up and confront them and stand in the way, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:55.334 --> 00:25:56.354]  We are doing that.
[00:25:56.975 --> 00:26:02.398]  And their approval ratings and their poll numbers continue to fall like a falling star to earth.
[00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:04.580]  They are on fire.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.881]  They are falling apart.
[00:26:06.241 --> 00:26:12.985]  And they arrogantly, filled with hubris and false bravado, continue to move forward against us.
[00:26:13.265 --> 00:26:14.046]  And I say, good!
[00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:16.731]  Show everybody exactly who and what you are.
[00:26:19.253 --> 00:26:28.838]  They made it clear, that is Congress did, that continuing any such agenda at this point would be disregarding growing apprehension in Congress about the plans.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:40.967]  As you travel to Montebello, Canada later this month for a summit with your Canadian and Mexican counterparts, we want you to be aware of serious and growing concerns in the U.S.
[00:26:41.027 --> 00:26:46.911]  Congress about the so-called Security and Prosperity Partnership you launched with these nations in 2005.
[00:26:48.232 --> 00:26:53.336]  Ordering the bureaucracies, I would add, outside of Congressional oversight or control.
[00:26:54.297 --> 00:26:54.817]  Executive.
[00:26:55.197 --> 00:26:55.537]  Fiat.
[00:26:56.138 --> 00:26:57.699]  To merge their operations.
[00:26:57.839 --> 00:26:58.460]  That's what's happening.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.241]  To standardize their operations.
[00:27:00.913 --> 00:27:02.194]  Well, that little criminal, James Woolsey,
[00:27:22.142 --> 00:27:31.425]  Who runs the think tank calling for Bush to be made dictator and for them to arrest everyone that disagrees with him and to attack and, quote, nuke the Arabs for genocide.
[00:27:31.445 --> 00:27:35.887]  I mean, he was basically running the meeting for NORTHCOM last year!
[00:27:36.427 --> 00:27:38.008]  We got these sub-minutes!
[00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:51.458]  For instance, the letters said, measures that would make it easier to move goods and people across the borders could have the effect of further weakening the country's ability to secure its frontiers and preventing legal immigration.
[00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:55.081]  Yeah, the Congress, the people, don't want Mexican trucks.
[00:27:57.123 --> 00:27:59.284]  Through NAFTA and the executive, they just do it.
[00:28:00.285 --> 00:28:03.027]  We don't want to use our tax money to build the Mexican roads and ports.
[00:28:03.087 --> 00:28:04.528]  They just do it through NAFTA and GAAP.
[00:28:05.209 --> 00:28:06.210]  They just do all this.
[00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:17.155]  The letter also cited documents obtained by Judicial Watch and the Freedom of Information Act request that suggest such secretiveness seems not to be accidental.
[00:28:19.316 --> 00:28:27.119]  World Net Daily was among the first news organizations to obtain and publish the agenda and the list of attendees for a secret North American Union forum.
[00:28:27.139 --> 00:28:28.659]  Yeah, no one even knew this was happening.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:29.800]  The press wasn't even told.
[00:28:31.121 --> 00:28:38.746]  Held at the Fairmount Banff Springs Hotel in Banff, Alberta, Canada, from September 12th to the 14th, 2006.
[00:28:39.347 --> 00:28:45.651]  The meeting was closed to the press, and the documents obtained were marked, internal documents, not for public release.
[00:28:46.852 --> 00:28:53.637]  And those are just the baseline minutes that say secretive, you know, we gotta get a carbon tax, we gotta, I mean, these people aren't playing games.
[00:28:55.606 --> 00:29:01.716]  Judicial Watch also used a Freedom of Information Act request to obtain a set of notes from the Pentagon attendees at the secret Banff meeting.
[00:29:02.617 --> 00:29:09.068]  One particular disturbing comment was noted in the official conference records of the speeches given as recorded in the
[00:29:10.464 --> 00:29:15.227]  To what degree does the concept North America help or hinder solving problems between three countries?
[00:29:15.247 --> 00:29:16.728]  And it gets into that.
[00:29:16.768 --> 00:29:19.390]  We're going to come back, get to your calls, get more into this.
[00:29:40.726 --> 00:29:46.252]  We've got economic news, news on the hurricane, news on the Iran front, and a lot more.
[00:29:46.332 --> 00:29:50.477]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWarners.net are just two of the websites.
[00:29:51.798 --> 00:29:52.819]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.822]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.723 --> 00:29:58.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.182 --> 00:30:05.784]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:30:06.024 --> 00:30:06.905]  Look no further!
[00:30:07.185 --> 00:30:09.747]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:30:10.187 --> 00:30:18.592]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:30:18.592 --> 00:30:19.052]  I think so.
[00:30:36.357 --> 00:30:36.697]  I don't know.
[00:31:02.324 --> 00:31:04.806]  Do you know that you can go solar for under 1200 bucks now?
[00:31:05.326 --> 00:31:06.467]  Hi, this is Ken Solar.
[00:31:06.647 --> 00:31:10.830]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:16.294]  The solar power generators that I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.
[00:31:16.814 --> 00:31:23.239]  Your refrigerator, your freezer, lights, fans, electric blankets, TV, radio, clocks, phones, computers, and a lot more.
[00:31:23.974 --> 00:31:26.676]  No gas, no fumes, and they're totally silent.
[00:31:26.836 --> 00:31:36.804]  Each solar power generator comes complete with everything you'll need, including the solar panel, a 3,000 watt peak inverter, a step-by-step quick setup sheet, and battery backup.
[00:31:37.084 --> 00:31:40.787]  I reached that point in my life where I just didn't want to have to rely on everyone else anymore.
[00:31:40.847 --> 00:31:47.332]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.
[00:31:47.513 --> 00:31:48.553]  Are you ready to go solar?
[00:31:48.754 --> 00:31:49.714]  Give me a call now at 239-677-3073.
[00:31:53.617 --> 00:31:57.660]  Or order them on the website at a 10% discount on KenSolar.com.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.262]  That's KenSolar.com.
[00:32:01.703 --> 00:32:03.684]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[00:32:03.944 --> 00:32:07.006]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[00:32:07.287 --> 00:32:12.130]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.212]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[00:32:15.452 --> 00:32:20.175]  This technology is backed by hundreds of thousands of dollars of testing that the oil companies have run.
[00:32:20.456 --> 00:32:22.377]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[00:32:22.857 --> 00:32:32.744]  SFR, the leader in fuel products, has obtained this technology and we are so convinced you'll notice the savings that we will give you, the loyal GCN listener, a bottle for free!
[00:32:33.124 --> 00:32:37.847]  SFR is not an injector cleaner or typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[00:32:38.127 --> 00:32:41.690]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:44.091]  Just pay a minimal shipping and handling charge.
[00:32:44.412 --> 00:32:46.573]  If you're not completely delighted with the savings,
[00:32:46.753 --> 00:32:48.554]  We'll leave and refund the shipping charge.
[00:32:48.874 --> 00:32:52.016]  Share the oil company's secret and get SFR now!
[00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:53.136]  What are you waiting for?
[00:32:53.336 --> 00:32:54.017]  Call 1-888-USE-SFR1.
[00:32:54.237 --> 00:32:54.637]  That's 1-888-873-7971 today!
[00:33:24.082 --> 00:33:47.384]  On the middle of the road Trying to find me I'm standing in the middle of life With my pants behind me I got a smile For everyone I meet As long as you don't try Dragging my bag Dropping a bomb on my street
[00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:50.370]  That's right.
[00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:53.112]  Just don't mess with my babies.
[00:33:53.152 --> 00:33:54.853]  Don't drop a bomb on my street.
[00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:57.994]  And I'll be real nice to you.
[00:33:59.415 --> 00:34:03.697]  But the government is the greatest threat to our children.
[00:34:04.197 --> 00:34:05.338]  They kidnap the most of them.
[00:34:05.398 --> 00:34:08.620]  They statistically are the most dangerous to our children.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:10.641]  They did attack us on 9-11.
[00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:12.882]  They've staged many other events on us.
[00:34:12.962 --> 00:34:14.523]  They have dropped a bomb on our street.
[00:34:15.363 --> 00:34:16.404]  And they are our enemies.
[00:34:17.644 --> 00:34:18.805]  We didn't draw first blood.
[00:34:19.477 --> 00:34:22.599]  They've got to be dealt with, they've got to be responded to, they've got to be exposed.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:29.884]  You have these degenerate criminals meeting up there, but their protests begin ahead of Montebello Summit.
[00:34:30.204 --> 00:34:44.513]  Hundreds of activists rallied on Parliament Hill, there in Ottawa, the capital of Canada, just a few miles away from the summit, to protest the secretive nature of the upcoming summit in Montebello, Quebec, involving North America's three political leaders.
[00:34:45.354 --> 00:34:48.216]  And this just came out today.
[00:34:48.968 --> 00:34:55.551]  However, their agenda extended beyond those talks to issues as diverse as climate change and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:34:55.791 --> 00:35:05.776]  Yeah, they come out with little public speeches for a few minutes each day for the press that's even allowed inside the 18-mile security cordon.
[00:35:07.357 --> 00:35:13.019]  Another report here, and these are mainstream reports that you can read up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:18.122]  We've got continual coverage there on all of these areas of the site.
[00:35:18.763 --> 00:35:36.259]  Partnership viewed as threat to sovereignty, a coalition of Canadian, American, and Mexican energy workers, unions, and nine lobbying groups yesterday denounced the Security and Prosperity Partnership discussed by leaders of the three countries in Montebello as a threat to each nation's energy sovereignty.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.580]  And then it goes through!
[00:35:37.981 --> 00:35:43.406]  See, the hoax hasn't worked first saying SPP didn't exist, then we caught them having a secret meeting.
[00:35:43.466 --> 00:35:44.567]  Remember, first it didn't exist.
[00:35:45.645 --> 00:35:58.997]  Then, okay, it exists, but, and they had a public meeting earlier this year, but just for the public, most of it was secret, and even Rice said we're integrating the three areas, we're all in one region, in the public press conference, she couldn't shut her mouth.
[00:35:59.457 --> 00:36:02.640]  Then we got more documents on them, and we know what it is!
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:09.446]  They can't get the Parliament or the Congresses to pass the end of our countries, so they just say, okay, executive fiat!
[00:36:10.026 --> 00:36:10.907]  It's real simple!
[00:36:11.937 --> 00:36:12.518]  Real simple!
[00:36:12.978 --> 00:36:19.144]  And then the people say, hey, we don't like that, Congress says they don't like it, and the President just says it doesn't exist!
[00:36:21.066 --> 00:36:36.321]  But I'll assure you, the highways they're building, and Perry going to the Bilderberg Group, and the Mexican troops doing cross-training, and the Canadians, and the state police from Texas running checkpoints for the last year off and on all over Canada in major newspapers, that's real, folks!
[00:36:38.991 --> 00:36:42.514]  Alright, let's just go to some of your phone calls right now.
[00:36:42.534 --> 00:36:45.196]  Oh yeah, I programmed that before I do that.
[00:36:45.216 --> 00:36:46.857]  I haven't really plugged this properly.
[00:36:47.938 --> 00:36:50.720]  If you want to see Endgame, there's one way to see it.
[00:36:52.141 --> 00:36:52.981]  And that's in the theater.
[00:36:54.162 --> 00:36:59.726]  And it's going to be shown five times.
[00:37:00.106 --> 00:37:02.568]  And five times only until it comes out on DVD.
[00:37:03.609 --> 00:37:05.270]  And that is in mid-October.
[00:37:06.738 --> 00:37:07.358]  It's done now.
[00:37:07.378 --> 00:37:10.019]  We've got to finish the website, the cover, the rest of it, get it off.
[00:37:10.659 --> 00:37:14.721]  But we are going to be showing it the 4th, 5th, and 6th in Austin.
[00:37:15.161 --> 00:37:16.821]  Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:37:17.181 --> 00:37:18.762]  It only holds 230 people.
[00:37:19.402 --> 00:37:20.682]  They've got food and drinks.
[00:37:20.702 --> 00:37:23.803]  I mean, it's full service luxury theater, folks.
[00:37:24.364 --> 00:37:25.144]  That's the only way to describe it.
[00:37:25.164 --> 00:37:25.924]  They don't call it that.
[00:37:25.944 --> 00:37:29.805]  It's down to earth and friendly folks, but it's Texas luxury.
[00:37:29.825 --> 00:37:34.147]  I mean, they've got steaks, hamburgers, everything.
[00:37:34.227 --> 00:37:34.987]  It's ridiculous.
[00:37:35.948 --> 00:37:40.010]  I mean, once you've gone and been to a theater like this, the other ones, they're worthless.
[00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.371]  But, side issue!
[00:37:44.232 --> 00:37:49.035]  It's going to be a single showing the 4th, 5th, and 6th at 7 o'clock.
[00:37:50.315 --> 00:37:53.197]  And then, I come back from New York on the 17th.
[00:37:53.637 --> 00:37:56.478]  It's going to be shown one more time at the Alamo, and that is it.
[00:37:57.219 --> 00:37:58.359]  And then, they've been asking for it.
[00:37:58.379 --> 00:38:01.321]  There might be a run in October for like a week at their theaters.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:03.821]  I mean, I could put this in theaters around the country.
[00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:09.443]  Just all the legwork involved, if it isn't through a major film distributor, is just next to impossible.
[00:38:09.463 --> 00:38:15.345]  I mean, I could four-wall it in hundreds of theaters around the country, but then I'd have to have people there to do it, or it would be a disaster.
[00:38:15.365 --> 00:38:21.128]  You've got to individually run them, individually be there, individually somehow promote it.
[00:38:21.188 --> 00:38:22.908]  If it doesn't work, you're bankrupt.
[00:38:23.269 --> 00:38:23.989]  So we're not doing that.
[00:38:24.029 --> 00:38:28.331]  It's going to be shown a few places around the country, New York and Austin, and that's it.
[00:38:28.371 --> 00:38:29.291]  It's going to come out on DVD.
[00:38:31.178 --> 00:38:37.985]  So, if you want to see it in Austin, you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:38:38.065 --> 00:38:50.938]  At the top of PrisonPlanet.com, there is a banner, endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, and you can buy tickets for the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 17th.
[00:38:52.913 --> 00:38:56.317]  And they always sell out, and people always get upset and say, I wish I'd have got tickets.
[00:38:56.797 --> 00:39:01.402]  Get your tickets now online, or if you live in Austin, drive by South Lamar, buy them at the door now.
[00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:05.186]  Bring your friends and family.
[00:39:05.226 --> 00:39:07.569]  This film is dwarfs anything I've ever made.
[00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:10.992]  I mean, and Terror Storm was better than anything I'd ever made.
[00:39:11.032 --> 00:39:12.374]  We just exponentially get better here.
[00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.412]  I keep saying 14 months.
[00:39:15.512 --> 00:39:17.433]  I've been saying that for the last two months.
[00:39:17.453 --> 00:39:19.593]  16 months in the making.
[00:39:19.613 --> 00:39:20.734]  16 months in the making.
[00:39:20.894 --> 00:39:23.935]  I mean, I'll probably never even make my money back on this.
[00:39:23.955 --> 00:39:26.755]  This is a love affair thing.
[00:39:28.376 --> 00:39:32.097]  And so, it's powerful.
[00:39:33.097 --> 00:39:36.778]  So, I hope that you will come to it.
[00:39:37.198 --> 00:39:38.919]  They're also showing it on the 9th.
[00:39:39.739 --> 00:39:40.999]  I don't have all the details on that.
[00:39:41.039 --> 00:39:43.000]  It's at WeAreChanged.org in New York City.
[00:39:43.530 --> 00:39:44.851]  So you can also come see it there.
[00:39:46.312 --> 00:39:48.453]  Now there's one more little caveat, and I will go to your calls.
[00:39:48.513 --> 00:39:49.274]  Bill just hung up.
[00:39:49.334 --> 00:39:51.395]  Bill from Tennessee, call back in if you're able to.
[00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:52.295]  I'll go to you first.
[00:39:52.796 --> 00:39:55.257]  I don't like somebody holding for 30 minutes and not getting on.
[00:39:55.277 --> 00:39:55.417]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:39:55.437 --> 00:39:58.119]  We'll get to everybody here in a minute.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.082]  There's a double feature on the 4th.
[00:40:03.182 --> 00:40:03.823]  What is that, a Monday?
[00:40:04.583 --> 00:40:06.644]  There is a double feature at the Alamo.
[00:40:07.105 --> 00:40:09.506]  I'm going to show the second edition of Terror Storm.
[00:40:10.767 --> 00:40:11.407]  One last time.
[00:40:11.747 --> 00:40:12.488]  Showed it three times.
[00:40:13.556 --> 00:40:14.337]  No, I showed it one time.
[00:40:14.837 --> 00:40:16.018]  That's all I've shown at NOS at one time.
[00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:17.139]  This will be the last time.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.521]  Should be the last time.
[00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:22.885]  And so you're going to first see Endgame and then the new Terror Storm.
[00:40:24.126 --> 00:40:25.167]  Five hours total.
[00:40:25.667 --> 00:40:26.668]  Quite a double feature.
[00:40:27.569 --> 00:40:29.891]  But I'll be there speaking on all of them.
[00:40:29.911 --> 00:40:30.972]  Okay, I'm done talking about that.
[00:40:32.494 --> 00:40:35.256]  Bill in Tennessee is gone, so we'll go to Michael in Alabama.
[00:40:35.296 --> 00:40:36.137]  Thanks for holding, Michael.
[00:40:36.157 --> 00:40:37.498]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:40:37.758 --> 00:40:38.299]  Good, go ahead.
[00:40:38.905 --> 00:40:39.125]  Great.
[00:40:39.285 --> 00:40:41.226]  I have some good news, and I need to vent for a second.
[00:40:41.947 --> 00:40:46.510]  I went to the Alabama Straw Poll, and Ron Paul won with 81% of the vote.
[00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:47.931]  It was a huge Ron Paul rally.
[00:40:48.431 --> 00:40:48.711]  That's right.
[00:40:48.731 --> 00:40:50.452]  We've got an article coming out later today.
[00:40:50.772 --> 00:40:55.775]  He won in New Hampshire, he won in Alabama, he won in Illinois, and the media is not covering it.
[00:40:56.296 --> 00:40:57.136]  I can't stand it.
[00:40:57.236 --> 00:41:00.839]  Every time that I listen to Mark... Listen, that guy I called in the other day about Mark Levin, that's serious.
[00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.060]  This guy is trying to stonewall
[00:41:04.054 --> 00:41:04.614]  Ron Paul.
[00:41:04.694 --> 00:41:09.056]  He's trying to encourage people to call him and tell him he can't win and we need to plug him up.
[00:41:09.096 --> 00:41:11.476]  Well, this is some nobody talk show host.
[00:41:12.157 --> 00:41:13.737]  He's syndicated by ABC, isn't he?
[00:41:14.717 --> 00:41:15.158]  I'm not sure.
[00:41:15.178 --> 00:41:15.858]  I listen to him.
[00:41:15.898 --> 00:41:18.278]  He's on after Hannity on the AIM station I listen to.
[00:41:18.298 --> 00:41:20.299]  Yeah, I mean, so what?
[00:41:20.339 --> 00:41:23.060]  Look, all he's doing is destroying his show.
[00:41:23.692 --> 00:41:32.697]  But, I mean, that's why, look, Limbaugh's ratings are plunging, Borch's ratings are plunging, and I heard Borch attacking Bush, though, for 30 minutes this morning, so he's finally getting lies.
[00:41:33.638 --> 00:41:37.300]  Hannity is plunging, they're all, I mean, and I'm not just saying that.
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:47.466]  I mean, listen, whereas Prison Planet has gotten bigger, Limbaugh, Limbaugh a year ago was rated number 4,000 on the web, okay?
[00:41:47.486 --> 00:41:48.347]  A World Net Daily's like 1,000.
[00:41:49.367 --> 00:41:50.588]  Guess what Limbaugh is now?
[00:41:53.472 --> 00:41:55.793]  Forty-something thousand on Alexa last time I checked.
[00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:57.734]  Guess what Sean Hannity is?
[00:41:58.654 --> 00:41:59.235]  Same thing.
[00:41:59.695 --> 00:41:59.895]  Really?
[00:42:00.135 --> 00:42:00.816]  Oh, no.
[00:42:00.896 --> 00:42:01.916]  What, did he tell you that?
[00:42:02.977 --> 00:42:04.638]  The guy's a congenital liar!
[00:42:05.649 --> 00:42:09.590]  That's an America-hating, piece of filth, fake conservative.
[00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:10.710]  I can't stand him.
[00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:15.091]  He's a sniveling, good boy, fake act.
[00:42:15.431 --> 00:42:16.852]  Acts like he likes his listeners.
[00:42:16.892 --> 00:42:18.072]  You're a great American.
[00:42:18.312 --> 00:42:19.752]  That guy wants one thing.
[00:42:20.072 --> 00:42:22.053]  He's a goose-stepping fascist.
[00:42:22.133 --> 00:42:23.073]  He's leading us to the end.
[00:42:23.113 --> 00:42:24.093]  He's a punk.
[00:42:24.193 --> 00:42:25.314]  He's not even a fascist.
[00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:26.074]  He's just a punk.
[00:42:26.574 --> 00:42:27.594]  I can't believe he believes me.
[00:42:27.614 --> 00:42:28.434]  That terrifies me.
[00:42:28.694 --> 00:42:30.855]  Go ahead and tell the listeners what the traitor Levin is doing.
[00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:42.860]  He's putting on his website and on his radio, he's been putting out alerts to people to call up the Ron Paul headquarters, give them the number for the headquarters and say, tell this guy he's not going to win.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:52.307]  And we need to screw him up, we need to get on his... I personally disagree with you, Michael, and I appreciate your call.
[00:42:53.248 --> 00:42:55.149]  He's doing this because they're grounding.
[00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.811]  And he knows Ron Paul has a massive...
[00:42:59.588 --> 00:43:14.711]  Following on the internet and in the real world, brick and mortar, and he knows it's the hottest thing, number one internet search term, and he's trying to get all of you stirred up like a bunch of bumblebees to go give him a bunch of attention and talk trash about him all over the web.
[00:43:16.292 --> 00:43:20.672]  If you do that, and I'm getting a lot of calls and emails about Mark Levin, he wins.
[00:43:20.872 --> 00:43:21.773]  He gets talked about.
[00:43:21.793 --> 00:43:23.253]  The failure that he is.
[00:43:24.838 --> 00:43:25.438]  He wins.
[00:43:25.538 --> 00:43:28.939]  Now, if you ignore him, he will destroy himself.
[00:43:29.379 --> 00:43:30.439]  I mean, he's not stupid.
[00:43:30.479 --> 00:43:34.620]  He knows it's going to hurt him with his base of conservative listeners that he's still got left.
[00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:37.980]  That Ron Paul's winning the culture war.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.381]  The conservatives are finding out how they've been betrayed.
[00:43:40.741 --> 00:43:46.762]  So, if it's contained to only his show, he'll blow out 20-30% of his audience that he had left.
[00:43:48.042 --> 00:43:53.503]  But, if he tricks you into talking about him, everybody will tune in and he'll get a buzz on the web.
[00:43:54.564 --> 00:43:57.385]  So, please, please, some wash up.
[00:43:58.025 --> 00:43:58.605]  Nobody.
[00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:00.745]  Who cares?
[00:44:02.326 --> 00:44:05.646]  Look, let me tell you a secret of why I have a lot of listeners.
[00:44:06.247 --> 00:44:07.427]  It's not just a dynamic show.
[00:44:07.467 --> 00:44:11.108]  It's not just that I tell it like it is, and I'm not even really that good of a talk show host, but it's real.
[00:44:11.488 --> 00:44:17.329]  And I've got a good grasp of history on a lot of issues, and people have checked into that, and so, you know, it's also somewhat informative, and we have a lot of great guests on.
[00:44:18.044 --> 00:44:20.926]  And we have news websites and films that go with it, so it's multifaceted.
[00:44:20.946 --> 00:44:22.367]  There's a lot of synergy there.
[00:44:22.827 --> 00:44:27.150]  But more than that, over the years, I was attacked by every Patriot host.
[00:44:27.911 --> 00:44:33.374]  They instinctively were jealous, envious, as I was rising, and they would attack me.
[00:44:34.055 --> 00:44:35.616]  They'd never really been radio trained.
[00:44:35.636 --> 00:44:37.117]  They'd never studied in the industry.
[00:44:37.157 --> 00:44:38.438]  They didn't know how media worked.
[00:44:38.718 --> 00:44:39.218]  I had.
[00:44:40.739 --> 00:44:46.203]  And I knew, from old-timers, from just local radio wars, when the other talk show host attacks you,
[00:44:46.753 --> 00:44:49.515]  It's because you've got higher ratings and he wants you to talk about him.
[00:44:49.875 --> 00:44:52.678]  Hosts who are bigger than the other never attack the other one.
[00:44:53.838 --> 00:45:01.564]  So I was taught by the old radio guys, I mean people who were doing... One old guy lived around here who I first worked with and he left the station when I first got started.
[00:45:03.065 --> 00:45:06.348]  Sharkman had been nationwide, you know, rock and roll DJ.
[00:45:06.368 --> 00:45:08.669]  I mean he interviewed everybody in the studio.
[00:45:08.730 --> 00:45:10.431]  Led Zeppelin, Metallica, The Who.
[00:45:11.289 --> 00:45:13.710]  And he said, listen, when they're all attacking you, that's good.
[00:45:14.031 --> 00:45:15.251]  You don't respond to them.
[00:45:15.351 --> 00:45:18.953]  Let them give their audience to you.
[00:45:21.715 --> 00:45:24.836]  And then you don't respond, and it's a one-way deal.
[00:45:24.856 --> 00:45:27.378]  I mean, that's a one-on-one thing.
[00:45:28.158 --> 00:45:34.101]  So when all these big talk show hosts, first in the Patriot movement, everyone else lied about me, attacked me, that's what's so funny.
[00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:35.842]  I even tell them on air.
[00:45:36.182 --> 00:45:39.524]  But they're so primitive and dumb, they still can't figure it out.
[00:45:41.568 --> 00:45:48.031]  They still can't figure out that, like, I love the website saying I'm a Scientologist at 55 years old.
[00:45:48.191 --> 00:45:48.592]  I'm not.
[00:45:49.552 --> 00:45:50.753]  Don't know any Scientologists.
[00:45:50.773 --> 00:45:52.133]  Never been to a Scientologist meeting.
[00:45:53.334 --> 00:45:57.596]  When they get up and say I'm a top Catholic assassin, I just laugh.
[00:45:57.656 --> 00:45:58.196]  It's not true.
[00:45:58.236 --> 00:45:59.117]  I'm not a Catholic.
[00:45:59.777 --> 00:46:01.058]  My whole family's Protestant.
[00:46:01.218 --> 00:46:01.838]  It's funny.
[00:46:02.979 --> 00:46:04.800]  When they say I'm a Mossad agent.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.881]  I got the ADL attacking me, folks.
[00:46:07.341 --> 00:46:08.502]  I'm not a Mossad agent.
[00:46:08.862 --> 00:46:10.002]  No connection to Mossad.
[00:46:13.661 --> 00:46:14.742]  Again, it's funny.
[00:46:15.702 --> 00:46:17.924]  Now, I'll mention the specific attacks.
[00:46:18.404 --> 00:46:19.585]  I mean, I'll mention what people are saying.
[00:46:19.625 --> 00:46:31.032]  I won't say their name or who they are, what they're doing, because all they do is go out there and literally advertise InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:46:33.174 --> 00:46:37.777]  And when I talk about it, it enrages them more, and they do it more!
[00:46:38.718 --> 00:46:44.180]  Oh, they're so stupid!
[00:46:45.261 --> 00:46:45.821]  Oh, man.
[00:46:48.022 --> 00:46:48.522]  So, listen.
[00:46:49.482 --> 00:46:51.803]  I see Neil Borch is on the same level as I am.
[00:46:52.663 --> 00:46:53.063]  Okay?
[00:46:53.103 --> 00:46:54.464]  And he sees me as bigger.
[00:46:55.644 --> 00:46:57.205]  That's why he attacks me every day.
[00:46:58.325 --> 00:46:59.646]  And it's because Neil's a smart guy.
[00:46:59.686 --> 00:47:02.427]  He knows how to look at web ratings and radio ratings and things like that.
[00:47:03.227 --> 00:47:05.988]  And I'm well known in the industry and he's been in talk radio for 25, 30 years.
[00:47:06.088 --> 00:47:06.448]  I think it's 30.
[00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:12.242]  And so, now, at that level, I'll go ahead and engage with him.
[00:47:12.902 --> 00:47:18.824]  It's like when the Houston Chronicle attacks me, or the New York Times attacks me, or tonight, you're going to see a two-hour special.
[00:47:20.165 --> 00:47:26.606]  Lord knows it's going to be, it's Hearst Publishing, horrible, vicious hit piece on the History Channel.
[00:47:26.746 --> 00:47:29.887]  And we're going to, I guess I'm going to stay up late here tonight.
[00:47:29.907 --> 00:47:31.168]  The rest of my crew is too exhausted.
[00:47:31.188 --> 00:47:31.828]  I'm not going to let them.
[00:47:32.428 --> 00:47:38.250]  We're going to try to tape it, get excerpts up by late tonight to analyze it, and then reports up in the morning from Paul Watson.
[00:47:39.193 --> 00:47:39.934]  And Steve Watson.
[00:47:41.336 --> 00:47:44.620]  But I will respond to that because, see, that's bigger than us.
[00:47:45.421 --> 00:47:47.163]  We only fight Goliaths, folks.
[00:47:47.203 --> 00:47:48.464]  We don't fight little people.
[00:47:50.927 --> 00:47:57.475]  And if I spent all day just responding and dealing with these COINTELPRO ops, most of them aren't, though.
[00:47:57.495 --> 00:47:58.657]  Most of them are just schizophrenic.
[00:48:00.169 --> 00:48:02.010]  Or a lot of them are on these little holier-than-thou.
[00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:03.231]  You can watch clips of them on the web.
[00:48:03.251 --> 00:48:04.532]  People that say I'm this or say I'm that.
[00:48:04.552 --> 00:48:07.853]  They always have glassy eyes and they're feeling real good.
[00:48:08.074 --> 00:48:09.254]  They're on little power trips.
[00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:16.538]  I just thank God my ancestors were made of stone and iron, folks.
[00:48:17.059 --> 00:48:18.880]  Because I am a modern fat weakling.
[00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:24.183]  But just the shadow that I am of my ancestors, I'm a shadow of what they were.
[00:48:24.203 --> 00:48:26.464]  And we're talking Andrew Jackson type people.
[00:48:27.273 --> 00:48:31.737]  I am just a shadow of them, but my shadow is so much stronger than most people.
[00:48:33.878 --> 00:48:37.802]  A lot of people out there are shadows too, but they're just shadows of shadows.
[00:48:38.342 --> 00:48:41.224]  I'm a shadow of real people that came before me.
[00:48:41.284 --> 00:48:42.185]  It's in my blood.
[00:48:42.245 --> 00:48:43.206]  It's in my guts.
[00:48:46.569 --> 00:48:47.710]  I love being attacked.
[00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.011]  I love the enemy shooting arrows at me.
[00:48:50.031 --> 00:48:51.072]  It means I'm doing my job.
[00:48:54.522 --> 00:48:55.183]  I'm going to digress.
[00:48:55.203 --> 00:48:55.983]  I want to go to your call.
[00:48:56.003 --> 00:48:59.806]  See, I don't want to talk about... Look, I'm not mad at you, Mike, and I understand you're mad.
[00:48:59.906 --> 00:49:02.748]  Don't let this Levin guy pull your chain.
[00:49:03.028 --> 00:49:06.571]  For heaven's sakes, do not talk about him.
[00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:07.792]  Do not respond to him.
[00:49:08.092 --> 00:49:09.132]  He is a nothing.
[00:49:10.433 --> 00:49:11.394]  He is nobody.
[00:49:12.635 --> 00:49:17.378]  What you do is you call into the shows and you pick fights with them about Ron Paul.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:20.921]  But you limit it to that.
[00:49:21.534 --> 00:49:29.336]  And you call into other shows and pick fights with them about PrisonPlanet.com and then you make them talk about us and not the other way around.
[00:49:29.416 --> 00:49:29.656]  Okay?
[00:49:30.156 --> 00:49:30.737]  It's one way.
[00:49:30.977 --> 00:49:32.157]  They give us everything.
[00:49:32.457 --> 00:49:33.377]  We give them nothing.
[00:49:33.657 --> 00:49:33.978]  Okay?
[00:49:35.138 --> 00:49:35.938]  That's how that works.
[00:49:36.258 --> 00:49:37.399]  They give us everything.
[00:49:37.719 --> 00:49:38.499]  We give them nothing.
[00:49:38.519 --> 00:49:39.659]  That's what Shark Man taught me.
[00:49:40.439 --> 00:49:41.580]  They give us everything.
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:42.680]  We give them nothing.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.120]  That's how this works, folks.
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:45.841]  That's how you win against the enemy.
[00:49:47.782 --> 00:49:49.444]  Believe me, they're tearing their hair out right now.
[00:49:49.544 --> 00:49:53.387]  Fox News, all of them, Limbaugh, they can't sell their bull anymore.
[00:49:53.647 --> 00:49:57.610]  They are on fire, literally spinning downwards into a crash.
[00:49:57.951 --> 00:49:59.952]  There's no, nothing can save them.
[00:50:00.593 --> 00:50:02.374]  Not new terror attacks, nothing.
[00:50:03.075 --> 00:50:03.375]  Okay?
[00:50:03.395 --> 00:50:03.996]  They blew it.
[00:50:04.316 --> 00:50:05.017]  They're shot!
[00:50:05.597 --> 00:50:06.318]  They're done!
[00:50:08.604 --> 00:50:11.586]  And they're just now starting to figure it out.
[00:50:11.666 --> 00:50:16.349]  So, when an animal, you know, let me, let's say you're hunting mountain lions and you shoot a mountain lion.
[00:50:16.649 --> 00:50:18.250]  Not that I've done this, I've just read accounts of it.
[00:50:18.570 --> 00:50:21.111]  When you shoot it and you're not sure it's dead, you don't run up on it.
[00:50:21.352 --> 00:50:23.613]  You let it go, be comfortable, and bleed to death.
[00:50:24.593 --> 00:50:28.136]  And just so, when they're flailing and scratching and grabbing, stand back.
[00:50:29.476 --> 00:50:32.458]  Let them go bleed out over the hill for 30 minutes an hour.
[00:50:32.798 --> 00:50:34.399]  Pull the sandwich out of your coat and eat it.
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:37.261]  Pull your pipe out and smoke a bowl of tobacco.
[00:50:39.088 --> 00:50:44.835]  God, I'm having lustful visions of what I'd like to be doing.
[00:50:44.855 --> 00:50:47.879]  Alright, we're going to be right back.
[00:50:49.061 --> 00:50:56.490]  The Simple Pleasures, a bologna and cheese sandwich in a deer stand in a bowl of tobacco.
[00:50:57.051 --> 00:50:57.712]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.402]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[00:51:08.762 --> 00:51:10.663]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[00:51:11.063 --> 00:51:18.727]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:51:19.407 --> 00:51:26.450]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:51:26.851 --> 00:51:29.792]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran.

[00:54:14.027 --> 00:54:17.268]  Tim in Montana, you're on the air.
[00:54:17.328 --> 00:54:17.689]  Welcome.
[00:54:18.609 --> 00:54:21.991]  Alex, thanks for taking the call and all you've done for the resistance.
[00:54:22.011 --> 00:54:22.731]  How are you doing today?
[00:54:23.071 --> 00:54:24.132]  Good, my friend.
[00:54:24.372 --> 00:54:25.472]  Thank you.
[00:54:25.492 --> 00:54:29.594]  Dave, you've had Bob Dacey and Mr. Corsi on.
[00:54:30.094 --> 00:54:41.500]  The one thing that kind of enlightened me, which I've got into, is this new transportation... Well, I shouldn't say new, but I noticed the Transportation Finance P3 conference coming up down in the
[00:54:42.555 --> 00:54:44.997]  At the Buttes of Marriott Resort in Tempe, Arizona.
[00:54:45.457 --> 00:54:47.258]  This October 18th and 19th.
[00:54:47.298 --> 00:54:48.439]  Have you heard much about this?
[00:54:48.499 --> 00:54:49.099]  Yes, I have.
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.182]  They had basically a sister conference.
[00:54:52.202 --> 00:54:54.563]  There's a lot of these here in Austin a few weeks ago.
[00:54:54.583 --> 00:54:57.285]  And that's the one that Bob and Kelly went to.
[00:54:57.825 --> 00:55:00.747]  And there they were saying, we got to keep this secret from the public.
[00:55:00.847 --> 00:55:03.829]  I mean, you go to the meetings and they're saying that.
[00:55:04.630 --> 00:55:09.113]  The one thing that I noticed was real interesting is at 1.30 to 2.30 p.m.
[00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:12.015]  I see that Stephen Parch with Babcock and Brown
[00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:15.734]  And that's not a new name in the household.
[00:55:16.335 --> 00:55:23.423]  I see that factors such as energy, the economy and resistance to taxation undercut traditional revenue sources.
[00:55:24.311 --> 00:55:28.034]  Policymakers are intensifying their interest in non-traditional funding options.
[00:55:28.434 --> 00:55:28.894]  That's right.
[00:55:28.954 --> 00:55:41.622]  I mean, if you read the policy reports from the SPP, from the CFR, from the different working groups, they're going to put transponders in all the inspection stickers, continent-wide, and taxes to drive down every major road.
[00:55:41.942 --> 00:55:47.126]  That's been in probably, no exaggeration, 300 mainstream articles I've seen in the last decade.
[00:55:47.666 --> 00:55:49.887]  Industry documents, I mean, that's what they're doing.
[00:55:49.927 --> 00:55:52.049]  And I heard KLBJ Radio
[00:55:52.529 --> 00:56:04.761]  Saturday night, with the state on there, on the news section saying, oh don't worry, all the new toll roads, you won't see toll road boxes, we're not going to make you stop, you're going to have a little chip that taxes you.
[00:56:05.301 --> 00:56:09.225]  Well of course, it was in the last two legislatures, in the bills!
[00:56:09.725 --> 00:56:15.491]  I mean, it's happening and you try to tell the general public and they just, they just, well they're starting to wake up.
[00:56:15.851 --> 00:56:24.458]  Well, and you see Schwarzenegger up there with Campbell doing the hydrogen highway up in Canada without even any federal government policy makers interacting.
[00:56:24.518 --> 00:56:30.842]  And now he's got Bloomberg signing on and then he says, oh, I want a trackership tax in New York.
[00:56:31.603 --> 00:56:33.084]  See, they're making their move, man.
[00:56:33.524 --> 00:56:38.028]  You know, the last thing, too, last month I see in the Canadian press
[00:56:38.706 --> 00:56:45.434]  As you were mentioning, the agreement will help set part of the agenda for the summit in Montebello next month between the leaders of the three countries.
[00:56:45.894 --> 00:56:48.838]  The partnership was billed as the first ever trilateral.
[00:56:49.599 --> 00:56:51.341]  But one thing that I noticed in here, Alex,
[00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:53.011]  Let's see here.
[00:56:53.031 --> 00:57:06.040]  It says here, the government will introduce measures next year to convince Canadians to unplug their microwaves and television sets in an effort that could generate enough saved energy to power 400,000 homes.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:09.663]  And then what they're going to do with that savings is just raise prices.
[00:57:09.703 --> 00:57:10.423]  But let me explain.
[00:57:10.984 --> 00:57:14.787]  That's called ritualization or habitualization.
[00:57:14.807 --> 00:57:18.049]  And they've written books about this.
[00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:19.970]  Recycling's fine.
[00:57:20.251 --> 00:57:20.591]  It's good.
[00:57:21.272 --> 00:57:36.400]  The problem is that they only do it to habitualize you so that something you do every day will then create perceived value in your head to sell you on a new culture and then all the new taxes and the bad things that they want to do.
[00:57:36.821 --> 00:57:38.602]  They also want to set the precedent.
[00:57:39.342 --> 00:57:46.506]  They want to set the precedent to make you have a certain type of toilet or make you have a certain type of light bulb or make you get inspections or
[00:57:47.452 --> 00:57:50.994]  Put taxes on you if you have more than one child.
[00:57:51.055 --> 00:57:55.317]  See, it leads, and they're now announcing that, to all of these new things.
[00:57:55.798 --> 00:57:57.819]  That's the problem with this.
[00:57:57.879 --> 00:58:07.786]  So, when they try to have you unplug your cell phone or unplug your microwave or do all of this, they're getting you to habitualize them directing you.
[00:58:08.306 --> 00:58:10.667]  Absolutely, Alex, and so many people are going to buy into it.
[00:58:10.787 --> 00:58:12.867]  You know, you see it straight across the board.
[00:58:12.907 --> 00:58:16.788]  We don't have but a small fragment out there that's going to go ahead and put up a fight about this.
[00:58:17.108 --> 00:58:27.591]  Say, one thing, if I might ask you, on this P3, obviously, people, prosperity, and the planet, is there any other websites or anywhere that, you know, I've tried to get some of the information about this P3.
[00:58:28.251 --> 00:58:29.691]  Can you give me a little more background?
[00:58:30.891 --> 00:58:33.572]  Well, I was just talking about the Security and Prosperity Partnership.
[00:58:34.615 --> 00:58:36.638]  But specifically, stay there briefly.
[00:58:36.939 --> 00:58:39.061]  Let me talk to you in the break and find out specifically what you want.
[00:58:41.545 --> 00:58:46.451]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.121 --> 00:59:02.323]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.963 --> 00:59:03.783]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.544 --> 00:59:05.424]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.444 --> 00:59:09.886]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.286 --> 00:59:14.407]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.587 --> 00:59:25.912]  Alright, coming up in about five minutes, we're going to have Dr. Jerome Corsi joining us from the third annual Security and Prosperity Partnership treason event.
[00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:28.270]  Hello Alex, how are you doing today?
[00:59:28.290 --> 00:59:30.451]  Yes, I'm the most positive person ever called into the show, I believe.
[00:59:30.471 --> 00:59:32.952]  I just sent copies of Jerome Corsi's book off last week
[00:59:56.311 --> 01:00:10.237]  To all my state and federal representatives, including the county sheriff, my township supervisor, and my state representatives, the senator and the state representative, have called me back and read the book, and they're asking, what can we do?
[01:00:10.397 --> 01:00:11.198]  What do we do?
[01:00:11.338 --> 01:00:16.900]  And I just told them, just keep educating more and more people, because if we resist, there's nothing that they can do.
[01:00:17.701 --> 01:00:18.661]  Absolutely nothing.
[01:00:19.061 --> 01:00:20.342]  So it is working.
[01:00:21.342 --> 01:00:23.223]  Jerome Corzi is a genius.
[01:00:23.683 --> 01:00:25.164]  It's a very good book, and
[01:00:26.272 --> 01:00:30.836]  I'm just so glad that I'm able to do something like this.
[01:00:30.856 --> 01:00:31.796]  It was your idea.
[01:00:31.896 --> 01:00:35.179]  I took it and ran with it, and it works great.
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.661]  So you're having a good effect with people in your area?
[01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:39.982]  Yes, I am.
[01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:42.004]  Yes, very much so.
[01:00:42.544 --> 01:00:45.607]  And people in the township are waking up to it.
[01:00:45.647 --> 01:00:47.288]  I put it in the township library.
[01:00:47.308 --> 01:00:48.429]  I donated it to them.
[01:00:48.996 --> 01:00:50.057]  They would have a copy.
[01:00:50.097 --> 01:00:52.879]  I put it in the newspaper saying that, hey, this book is there.
[01:00:53.259 --> 01:00:53.859]  Go read it.
[01:00:54.019 --> 01:00:55.420]  It's been checked out a few times.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.621]  I've been chucking into it.
[01:00:57.321 --> 01:01:01.904]  And see, that sounds like something small, but no, that's huge.
[01:01:02.605 --> 01:01:05.126]  And that's why I say everybody should go to mfoldwars.com.
[01:01:05.146 --> 01:01:07.308]  We have it at the cheapest price you're going to find.
[01:01:07.588 --> 01:01:13.152]  And buy three or four copies of it to give to friends and families and neighbors so they can actually have the documents.
[01:01:13.212 --> 01:01:18.475]  But listen, as great as late great USA is, wait until you see Endgame.
[01:01:19.222 --> 01:01:21.163]  Endgame, I mean, we go to Canada.
[01:01:21.203 --> 01:01:24.444]  We're here in Texas with the SPP and the NAFTA highways.
[01:01:24.564 --> 01:01:37.569]  I mean, it is, of the 2 hours and 20 minutes, and that's how long Endgame is, I'd say about an hour of it is about the North American Union and the SPP and the NAFTA highways and the Texas Corridor.
[01:01:38.089 --> 01:01:41.290]  And wait till you've got this visual tool for people.
[01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:43.791]  I cannot wait to release this film.
[01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:45.812]  It is going to just blow people away.
[01:01:47.802 --> 01:01:48.543]  Good to hear from you.
[01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:49.844]  I really appreciate your call.
[01:01:50.985 --> 01:01:53.827]  Let's go ahead and talk to Cliff.
[01:01:54.588 --> 01:01:56.189]  And Cliff, where are you calling us from?
[01:01:56.570 --> 01:01:59.232]  I'm calling you from Idaho, and thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:01:59.252 --> 01:02:00.393]  This is really important.
[01:02:00.973 --> 01:02:10.502]  About nine months ago, I informed Mel and Mark Richards of 1260 AM in Idaho Falls about the SPP, and they called me a conspiracy nut.
[01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:15.126]  So I finally got mad, just like you do sometimes, and I told them
[01:02:15.973 --> 01:02:20.275]  The program, Probing America, they couldn't probe their butt with both hands to find research.
[01:02:20.995 --> 01:02:29.859]  So I guess it done some good because they got a hold of Representative Joanne Woods in Rigby, and she's in the state legislature.
[01:02:30.879 --> 01:02:37.502]  And she came on their program after she'd done some research, and they're putting in a paper in the legislature up here.
[01:02:38.041 --> 01:02:40.562]  Not to abide by the SPP or anything like that.
[01:02:40.582 --> 01:02:44.664]  Well, now they've introduced and passed legislation trying to block highway funds federally.
[01:02:44.744 --> 01:02:46.625]  And see, these are probably good guys.
[01:02:47.286 --> 01:02:54.269]  And to them, to have the President lie and have Limbaugh lie, they hear that and they go, it just can't, they can't be lying.
[01:02:54.349 --> 01:02:57.491]  It's such a bald-faced lie that it takes them back.
[01:02:57.571 --> 01:02:59.692]  But now, because you challenged them,
[01:03:00.212 --> 01:03:07.075]  And because they did finally look into it, now, it's one thing when the government's trying this, it's another thing when they're lying to get it done.
[01:03:07.175 --> 01:03:13.759]  See, that's what people finally figure it out, and now you're going to have those guys on your side, so, so see... Oh, they are.
[01:03:14.219 --> 01:03:26.905]  Because I talked to them this morning, and I took a recording of your program yesterday, when Corsi was on, of him, when he came on, and you know he couldn't get his permit, you know, for the World Detonator, and now I know that he has got it.
[01:03:27.355 --> 01:03:34.301]  But I'm going to tape the one today, too, because I've got access, you know, to you and Austin and everything, you know, on the computer.
[01:03:34.321 --> 01:03:34.941]  You're awesome.
[01:03:34.962 --> 01:03:35.502]  You're awesome.
[01:03:35.542 --> 01:03:36.663]  You keep it up, my friend.
[01:03:36.703 --> 01:03:37.464]  God bless you.
[01:03:38.024 --> 01:03:39.525]  This is how we're going to win, see?
[01:03:40.146 --> 01:03:42.968]  All of you out there spreading the information.
[01:03:43.249 --> 01:03:44.530]  We're going to beat these people.
[01:03:44.590 --> 01:03:47.152]  You just first have to realize that it's possible.
[01:03:54.013 --> 01:03:54.774]  Terrorism!
[01:03:54.934 --> 01:03:55.694]  Terrorism!
[01:03:55.774 --> 01:04:01.839]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:03.701]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.423]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:04:06.803 --> 01:04:21.375]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:04:21.415 --> 01:04:21.735]  government.
[01:04:21.915 --> 01:04:23.697]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:04:24.077 --> 01:04:29.999]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:04:56.531 --> 01:05:02.016]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:05:02.376 --> 01:05:10.023]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:05:10.723 --> 01:05:17.766]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:05:18.166 --> 01:05:29.591]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:33.833]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:05:33.873 --> 01:05:35.814]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:05:36.134 --> 01:05:39.976]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:05:53.243 --> 01:05:53.663]  Attention!
[01:05:53.803 --> 01:05:55.764]  This is an urgent GCN News Bulletin!
[01:05:55.964 --> 01:06:00.206]  Honeybees are now mysteriously vanishing at an astonishing pace across the entire country.
[01:06:00.386 --> 01:06:03.308]  Why is this urgent message about honeybees so desperately important?
[01:06:03.528 --> 01:06:04.488]  The answer is easy.
[01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:10.111]  You see, honeybees produce a unique compound, fed only to the queen, that makes her live six times longer than other bees
[01:06:10.131 --> 01:06:10.471]  I think so.
[01:06:36.218 --> 01:06:38.398]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.317 --> 01:07:08.040]  Alright, Connie Fogle of the Canadian Action Party joining us in 25 minutes.
[01:07:10.582 --> 01:07:18.248]  Dr. Jerome Corsi, best-selling author of The Late Great USA, available at InfoWars.com bookstore and video store.
[01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:22.010]  Such an important book, and I wouldn't just get one copy, I'd get several.
[01:07:22.030 --> 01:07:25.593]  This information is absolutely vital to the future of this republic.
[01:07:26.093 --> 01:07:28.495]  He is in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.
[01:07:29.406 --> 01:07:37.018]  Right across the water there, there is the French area, where you really get into French proper.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:44.029]  He is now there, ladies and gentlemen, about to go back into Montebello.
[01:07:44.961 --> 01:07:49.742]  And he wrote a great article for World Endowment this week and Congress tells Bush back off SPP agenda.
[01:07:50.082 --> 01:07:54.603]  So to give us a report on the big press conference they had, the demonstrations they're witnessing.
[01:07:55.083 --> 01:07:56.523]  He just talked to him during the break.
[01:07:56.543 --> 01:08:00.424]  He described it as militarized city roadblocks.
[01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:08.606]  Here's Dr. Jerome Corsi from the third annual Security and Prosperity Partnership, the North American Union integration body.
[01:08:08.646 --> 01:08:09.126]  Welcome, sir.
[01:08:09.646 --> 01:08:10.026]  Hi, Alex.
[01:08:10.046 --> 01:08:10.926]  Great to be with you.
[01:08:11.266 --> 01:08:14.347]  And, you know, it's pretty remarkable because yesterday and Sunday
[01:08:15.023 --> 01:08:21.487]  When I mentioned that I was not going to be able to get press credentials, which is what I thought yesterday, then we had a press conference here.
[01:08:22.127 --> 01:08:24.289]  I covered the press conference for WorldNetDaily.
[01:08:24.369 --> 01:08:30.953]  Howard Phillips of the coalition to block the North American Union chaired the press conference.
[01:08:31.553 --> 01:08:37.217]  And when I got finished with it, just before noon, I called it over again and said, what was going on?
[01:08:37.237 --> 01:08:39.238]  And they said, well, your press credentials have been approved.
[01:08:39.658 --> 01:08:40.639]  Come on over and pick them up.
[01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:50.411]  So, as far as I can tell, the only thing that happened was your listeners must have gotten on the horn, and somehow the word got out, but my credentials did get approved.
[01:08:51.411 --> 01:08:53.752]  And the protests started yesterday.
[01:08:53.772 --> 01:09:00.194]  There were protests here in Ottawa, in front of the Parliament Building, and there's police all over the place.
[01:09:01.074 --> 01:09:08.156]  I'm told the roads to Montebello are roadblocked, and I'm going to have to have credentials to get through the roadblocks.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:11.562]  And I'll be taking my camera and photographing those.
[01:09:12.462 --> 01:09:15.084]  But I intend to get my credentials this afternoon.
[01:09:15.704 --> 01:09:19.066]  I've got to get some more radio done by five o'clock.
[01:09:19.727 --> 01:09:29.193]  I'm going to drive up to Montebello and see what's required to get in tomorrow to cover the final press conference that the three leaders will have at the end of their meeting.
[01:09:29.273 --> 01:09:30.914]  Are you going to be on coast-to-coast tonight?
[01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:34.956]  I'll have to get in touch with George Norrie.
[01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:37.798]  I've been so busy, it has been just
[01:09:38.943 --> 01:09:39.423]  No, me too.
[01:09:39.443 --> 01:09:41.785]  They just contacted me and I even missed the call Friday.
[01:09:42.045 --> 01:09:44.907]  But I've got a sneaking suspicion they're going to want you on.
[01:09:45.368 --> 01:09:46.949]  I know they'll want you on in the first hour.
[01:09:47.489 --> 01:09:50.312]  That's the case because I want to hear what's happened myself tonight by the end of the day.
[01:09:50.652 --> 01:09:54.175]  I'll contact with George Norrie and see if we can't set that up.
[01:09:54.395 --> 01:09:54.955]  Yeah, that's good.
[01:09:55.676 --> 01:10:04.179]  Now, bottom line here, this is unprecedented to have an 18-mile security cordon with checkpoints, and to have that now be confirmed.
[01:10:04.199 --> 01:10:05.640]  You said you talked to others that have seen it.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:11.822]  You're going to be going through later this afternoon to confirm that, and of course joining us tomorrow with another report, but I'm going to be on the phone with you this afternoon.
[01:10:12.202 --> 01:10:14.884]  I mean, I need to know immediately to put an article.
[01:10:15.084 --> 01:10:20.526]  This is unprecedented, that not only is it treasonous, but that they would have checkpoints on top of it.
[01:10:20.826 --> 01:10:22.126]  There's checkpoints on the road.
[01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:24.767]  We're going to have to go through checkpoints to get up to Montebello.
[01:10:25.247 --> 01:10:29.948]  Then I've been watching the local news coverage in Ottawa because they've had cameras up there all day.
[01:10:29.968 --> 01:10:35.269]  And it looks like there's Royal Acadian Mounted Police, police all over Montebello.
[01:10:35.289 --> 01:10:40.990]  They're going to land George Bush in on the golf course and they have to bring him in a golf cart.
[01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:44.170]  And you can imagine the security that they've got up there.
[01:10:44.210 --> 01:10:46.491]  It's like, it's a militarized zone.
[01:10:46.531 --> 01:10:47.271]  This might as well be
[01:10:47.816 --> 01:10:51.157]  Probably be easier to bring George Bush into the middle of Baghdad.
[01:10:51.317 --> 01:10:54.698]  Might as well be East Berlin in 1945.
[01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.378]  Exactly.
[01:10:56.858 --> 01:11:02.920]  I'm sure when I get out there I'm going to see not only Royal Canadian Mounted Police, I'm going to be looking for signs of U.S.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:03.600]  military.
[01:11:04.600 --> 01:11:07.701]  Seeing all the various signs I can see.
[01:11:07.721 --> 01:11:12.802]  I noticed when I came into Ottawa yesterday there was a huge C-130 parked at the airport.
[01:11:13.403 --> 01:11:14.703]  I wondered what that was about.
[01:11:15.382 --> 01:11:21.127]  And of course, there was no one to ask, and if he did ask, he'd probably be arrested immediately for wanting to know.
[01:11:22.007 --> 01:11:27.112]  But I consider being in Ottawa right now, Alex, as being in a militarized zone.
[01:11:27.572 --> 01:11:33.237]  You're dealing with a city that's pretty much under pretty heavy lockdown the closer you get to Montebello.
[01:11:33.817 --> 01:11:36.159]  And without credentials, I don't think anybody's getting in there.
[01:11:39.358 --> 01:11:46.183]  I'm here looking at PrisonPlanet.com, and I'm looking at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and on some other sites even more.
[01:11:46.623 --> 01:12:08.059]  I've seen at least ten mainstream articles, and even more TV reports, and they're all negative, even mainstream news, saying it's destroying our sovereignty, nine major unions are against it, all these teachers groups are against it, the Teamsters are against it, they're liars, we have their documents, it is the North American Union,
[01:12:09.139 --> 01:12:13.481]  I was looking at this right before you came on, and I went and said, in plain view, a huge story here.
[01:12:13.742 --> 01:12:16.603]  The dam has broken, at least in Canadian press, Dr. Courtsey.
[01:12:16.843 --> 01:12:21.545]  They are now calling it what it is, and it looks to me like the hoax has been blown wide open.
[01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:26.007]  I mean, they're reporting that it's a tyranny-pushing system.
[01:12:26.568 --> 01:12:35.832]  I think finally, Alex, with all the pressure, and of course your show's been on it, one of the very first to even mention it, even before I was on the story, you were on the story,
[01:12:36.939 --> 01:12:45.786]  And now there's just enough momentum that the pressure from even the mainstream media... We had a press conference here.
[01:12:46.306 --> 01:12:47.887]  The room was filled with cameras.
[01:12:47.947 --> 01:12:51.690]  We had the equivalent of the Canadian Associated Press here.
[01:12:52.651 --> 01:12:56.313]  There was extensive coverage, I think, coming out of this press conference.
[01:12:57.334 --> 01:13:03.619]  And, you know, the Canadians are now upset that... Connie Fogle was at the press conference.
[01:13:03.639 --> 01:13:05.480]  She's the head of the Canadian Action Party.
[01:13:06.027 --> 01:13:06.987]  And Connie Fogel said it.
[01:13:07.608 --> 01:13:09.928]  Most Canadians are upset about transparency.
[01:13:09.948 --> 01:13:14.930]  You know, Canadians have a standard, as we do in the United States, that public meetings ought to be open.
[01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:20.232]  But she said it's more than that, and that now the concerns are down to sovereignty.
[01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:28.055]  And of course, her party has, you know, been pushing the whole issue, that the secrecy is for a reason.
[01:13:28.735 --> 01:13:30.636]  And I think, Alex, what's finally catching on
[01:13:31.241 --> 01:13:44.346]  Is the question I ask is the beginning question in my book, The Late Great USA, and I'm saying, why, six years into a war on terror, does George Bush not have our borders with Mexico and Canada secured?
[01:13:44.366 --> 01:13:51.529]  You know, there are terrorists who come across that border, Hezbollah terrorists that were set up shop in Dearborn, Michigan, or in federal prison.
[01:13:52.129 --> 01:13:54.630]  George Bush knows terrorists that come across the border.
[01:13:54.650 --> 01:13:59.012]  I'm saying that immigration, this illegal immigration, is really just the symptom
[01:13:59.699 --> 01:14:13.290]  The cause is the Security and Prosperity Partnership and the elite agenda and the multinational corporate agenda to get Mexico and Canada merged with the United States to plug it into a world trade as a module.
[01:14:14.030 --> 01:14:15.472]  And it's a world trade agenda!
[01:14:16.352 --> 01:14:26.080]  And the middle class of America, I think now especially, headed into a recession, realizing that millions of jobs have been outsourced to slave labor in China,
[01:14:26.946 --> 01:14:29.829]  Uh, the exploitation of the Mexican workers that is going on.
[01:14:30.450 --> 01:14:37.017]  If you allow the Bolivian National Corporation to use slavery, in part we fought a civil war over states' rights.
[01:14:37.177 --> 01:14:40.100]  Yeah, slave goods is not free trade goods.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:41.322]  Not free trade goods.
[01:14:41.342 --> 01:14:44.365]  When I was at Harvard, I took a lot of international economics.
[01:14:45.115 --> 01:14:54.261]  And the premise of international trade was not that the competitive advantage of a nation justifying it to participate in world trade was like China.
[01:14:54.621 --> 01:14:56.222]  They subsidize their currency.
[01:14:56.602 --> 01:14:59.063]  They use slaves or near slaves for the production of goods.
[01:14:59.464 --> 01:15:02.425]  They allow their manufacturing companies to destroy the environment.
[01:15:02.866 --> 01:15:04.827]  That would have been considered unfair trade.
[01:15:05.487 --> 01:15:13.292]  And all the free trade provisions that would have protected a nation, you know, such as anti-slavery clauses,
[01:15:13.923 --> 01:15:16.445]  anti-currency support clauses.
[01:15:16.465 --> 01:15:20.707]  The Bush and Clinton administrations have taken out of these so-called free trade agreements.
[01:15:20.727 --> 01:15:41.560]  There's no environmental standards, no workers' comp, and then the very same crews pushing internationalism and pushing this neo-mercantilism are the ones then trying to stack even more regulations on us here, and then they openly snicker in their policy reports and say that it's not about, you know, helping workers, it's about driving the jobs into consolidated hands
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:49.407]  Mainly in China, as you said, for neo-mercantilism to literally wage economic war to destroy the free market.
[01:15:49.747 --> 01:15:55.552]  Well, it's a form of, you know, it's like 14th century Venetian mercantilism writ large.
[01:15:56.353 --> 01:15:59.796]  And, you know, unfortunately it's the same formula that the fascists used.
[01:15:59.876 --> 01:16:07.362]  In other words, the state was there to protect the growth of these mega-multinational corporations that were going to protect everybody.
[01:16:08.123 --> 01:16:08.944]  And it didn't work.
[01:16:09.605 --> 01:16:14.626]  In Venetian mercantilism, it doesn't work, didn't work in fascism, and it's not going to work today.
[01:16:15.486 --> 01:16:28.009]  Finally, you've got economists like this Alan Blinder over here at Princeton University, and he was one of the big pushers of this with the Clinton administration on the whole NAFTA agenda and free trade.
[01:16:28.129 --> 01:16:38.431]  Finally, Blinder gave a statement in the Wall Street Journal, picked it up a few months ago, I quoted it in my book, where he said, we're going to lose 40 million jobs in the next few decades.
[01:16:38.851 --> 01:16:39.271]  40 million!
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:43.242]  That's more manufacturing jobs than we have in the United States today.
[01:16:43.262 --> 01:16:52.346]  Well, I had Dr. Paul Greg Roberts, father of economics, head of the Treasury on, and he broke down the numbers, the Fed's own numbers that just came out.
[01:16:52.727 --> 01:16:57.429]  There has been not one new high-tech job to replace old ones.
[01:16:57.729 --> 01:17:01.751]  That is not one new one in growth in the last seven years.
[01:17:02.152 --> 01:17:07.955]  Well, people have to ask themselves, you know, the currency has been systematically devalued.
[01:17:08.815 --> 01:17:12.379]  Down about 25% from when the euro was created in 2002.
[01:17:12.859 --> 01:17:14.281]  That's not by accident.
[01:17:14.942 --> 01:17:17.244]  A dollar crisis which is brewing right now.
[01:17:18.205 --> 01:17:31.899]  The Fed, when it increased the discount rate last Friday to save a crash by more artificial liquidity being pumped into the system, very few people noticed it, but the dollar took a nosedive.
[01:17:32.577 --> 01:17:37.258]  Well, the more liquidity, the more rate easing the Fed does, the dollar is going to tank.
[01:17:37.478 --> 01:17:38.078]  Well, that's it.
[01:17:38.138 --> 01:17:43.199]  I mean, just one reason is that people aren't going to buy dollars if the interest rate is lower on it.
[01:17:43.279 --> 01:17:43.859]  Precisely.
[01:17:43.879 --> 01:17:48.080]  They can get better interest rates on the Euro.
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.001]  The European Central Bank has raised rates.
[01:17:50.581 --> 01:17:52.001]  People have got to ask themselves that.
[01:17:52.021 --> 01:17:52.861]  Right now, what are they getting?
[01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:53.001]  Like 8%?
[01:17:53.081 --> 01:17:55.782]  And you're getting like 3%, 4% on the dollar?
[01:17:55.902 --> 01:18:01.043]  There's a huge disparity right now between the rates you can get in Europe and you can get here, especially with us.
[01:18:01.607 --> 01:18:02.328]  We're good to go.
[01:18:17.628 --> 01:18:30.157]  When they say, look, you know, I'm working two jobs, my wife is working a job, we still can't buy what we bought five years ago or ten years ago, and we have no prospect of putting the kids through college if we can keep our house or our job.
[01:18:30.257 --> 01:18:36.362]  And meanwhile, they're meeting in Montebello, Canada, trying to push even more of the same medicine that's got us so sick.
[01:18:36.402 --> 01:18:37.423]  Dr. Corsi, stay there.
[01:18:37.483 --> 01:18:38.664]  Five more minutes on the other side.
[01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:43.948]  I want you to just tell us what happened at the press conference, what the mood is like, and
[01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:48.030]  Tell us when you're going to be going back through the checkpoints.
[01:18:48.430 --> 01:18:51.813]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, and Connie Fogel will be joining us.
[01:18:55.737 --> 01:19:07.007]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water of any kind, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments, such as local or national emergencies.
[01:19:07.228 --> 01:19:10.711]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria,
[01:19:10.971 --> 01:19:15.193]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:19:15.473 --> 01:19:19.395]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:19:19.635 --> 01:19:26.158]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:19:26.378 --> 01:19:31.881]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:19:32.101 --> 01:19:36.683]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[01:19:36.923 --> 01:19:39.026]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:19:39.086 --> 01:19:41.069]  Get the Berkey Light Purifier for only $279.
[01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:41.670]  Call New Millennium 888-803-4438.
[01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:41.990]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:43.752]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:19:43.772 --> 01:19:44.714]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:54.761]  Ted Anderson for Midas.
[01:19:54.881 --> 01:19:55.262]  August 20th, 2007.
[01:19:55.362 --> 01:19:55.682]  Gold 664.90.
[01:19:55.842 --> 01:19:57.604]  Ounce gold coins can be purchased for $6.76.
[01:19:57.644 --> 01:19:57.604]  $6.16.
[01:19:57.664 --> 01:19:57.984]  $3.33.
[01:19:57.684 --> 01:19:57.984]  $6.65 for half.
[01:19:58.004 --> 01:19:57.984]  $1.66.
[01:19:58.024 --> 01:19:58.505]  $8.83 per quarter.
[01:19:58.525 --> 01:19:58.785]  That's $6.76.
[01:19:58.885 --> 01:19:58.785]  $6.16.
[01:19:58.945 --> 01:19:58.785]  $3.33.
[01:19:58.965 --> 01:19:59.085]  $6.65.
[01:19:59.025 --> 01:19:59.085]  And $1.66. $8.83.
[01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:12.392]  Hedge funds caught in the malaise of mortgage bankruptcies.
[01:20:12.412 --> 01:20:14.173]  The bond market continues to slump.
[01:20:14.353 --> 01:20:14.653]  J.P.
[01:20:14.693 --> 01:20:17.594]  Morgan gets caught in a $10 billion bad deal for Chrysler.
[01:20:17.634 --> 01:20:19.816]  Housing sales fell 6.6%.
[01:20:19.876 --> 01:20:24.638]  Mortgage giant Countrywide showed mortgage payment woes spreading to the middle and upper class.
[01:20:24.718 --> 01:20:27.060]  Investors cast doubt on investment banks.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:31.502]  Credit protection insurance for mortgage lenders are skyrocketing due to the increased risk.
[01:20:31.582 --> 01:20:31.983]  The U.S.
[01:20:32.023 --> 01:20:36.305]  dollar is free-falling against foreign currencies and countries that previously financed the U.S.
[01:20:36.385 --> 01:20:38.126]  are now seeking safer alternatives.
[01:20:38.446 --> 01:20:40.147]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.598 --> 01:21:04.260]  Did you know that one goal of international communism was to get our young people's mind off religion by getting on to sex?
[01:21:05.121 --> 01:21:14.904]  By destroying the morals of the younger generation, America would eventually become ripe for revolution without understanding why communism wanted to make young people soft and easily controlled.
[01:21:16.002 --> 01:21:21.107]  Have we witnessed this transformation of our young people away from God and the Bible to immorality?
[01:21:21.767 --> 01:21:29.634]  We'd like to help you understand how these things are coming to pass by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:30.455 --> 01:21:31.976]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:37.581 --> 01:21:44.789]  That's 1-800-516-8736 to request your subscription.
[01:21:45.450 --> 01:21:46.070]  Call now.
[01:21:46.210 --> 01:21:48.973]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:53.338 --> 01:21:54.519]  Each night when you sleep,
[01:21:54.932 --> 01:21:59.313]  Your body uses the time to restore itself so that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[01:21:59.834 --> 01:22:02.234]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?
[01:22:02.694 --> 01:22:10.417]  Now there's NightSkin, a serum that goes on while you sleep to reduce age spots, reduce the appearance of wrinkles, and moisturize the skin.
[01:22:10.957 --> 01:22:17.519]  NightSkin was made by Dr. Arthur Perry, a board-certified cosmetic surgeon, as an alternative to some invasive surgeries.
[01:22:17.999 --> 01:22:23.220]  It has real ingredients that have been shown to reduce the signs of aging and fight natural sun damage.
[01:22:23.881 --> 01:22:25.481]  All while you get a good night's sleep.
[01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:31.183]  Try NightSkin today and see what it's like to wake up feeling renewed both inside and out.
[01:22:31.543 --> 01:22:33.823]  Try NightSkin risk-free by calling 1-800-894-3418.
[01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:39.205]  NightSkin is guaranteed to renew your skin overnight.
[01:22:39.465 --> 01:22:41.685]  Turning back the clock has never been this easy.
[01:22:42.046 --> 01:22:44.006]  Try NightSkin risk-free today.
[01:22:44.406 --> 01:22:44.766]  Call 1-800-894-3418.
[01:22:47.407 --> 01:22:47.747]  That's 1-800-894-3418.
[01:22:47.767 --> 01:22:48.767]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[01:22:48.807 --> 01:22:49.308]  This is the end,
[01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:27.702]  The globalists openly state that they engineer each stage of globalization until an engineered crisis that they design then brings it to a head, then they offer the next stage of globalization as the answer to the last policy that they publicize as a failure.
[01:23:28.263 --> 01:23:29.704]  It's really not a failure.
[01:23:30.632 --> 01:23:31.673]  Like Iraq's not a failure.
[01:23:31.713 --> 01:23:35.335]  They plan to be there permanently, to have sectarian war, to break it in three parts.
[01:23:35.655 --> 01:23:37.196]  They just told the public something else.
[01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:38.877]  It's the same thing with this.
[01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:40.597]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:23:41.018 --> 01:23:43.219]  Order out of chaos.
[01:23:43.779 --> 01:23:52.084]  They debase the dollar, blow out the economy, then the answer is the Amaro, which will first be just pegging the three currencies together, then moving to a standardized currency.
[01:23:52.324 --> 01:23:53.504]  The Trilateralists wrote that in 1973.
[01:23:55.299 --> 01:24:02.343]  Dr. Corsi joins us from right outside the conference, the SPP conference, where treason is being committed.
[01:24:04.063 --> 01:24:12.468]  Congress now is in the process of passing or trying to pass bills, blocking federal funds for super highways.
[01:24:13.388 --> 01:24:15.889]  People are waking up and resisting everywhere.
[01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:19.571]  I mean, is this the beginning of the end for these people, Dr. Corsi?
[01:24:20.051 --> 01:24:21.272]  I think, Alex, that it is.
[01:24:23.957 --> 01:24:36.420]  Once the light of day is shown on the Security and Prosperity Partnership, I don't think the elitists, or the multinational corporations, or George W. Bush will be able to find a dark corner in which to hide.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:44.741]  Because the American people will solidly reject this agenda, and we've exposed it thanks to talk radio, thanks to the Internet.
[01:24:45.361 --> 01:24:48.762]  Your show didn't exist in Europe in 1957.
[01:24:49.002 --> 01:24:53.503]  There was no way for people to share this information and get this knowledge out.
[01:24:54.409 --> 01:25:11.256]  When Duncan Hunter submitted that resolution to the Transportation Bill, and it got passed so overwhelmingly in the House that no money could be used by the Department of Transportation to participate in SPP working groups, that was a real death knell to SPP.
[01:25:11.376 --> 01:25:16.378]  I was about to say, it wasn't a shot across the bow, it was a shot with a howitzer directly into the bridge.
[01:25:16.558 --> 01:25:20.460]  Yeah, this put a huge hole below the waterline in the boat.
[01:25:21.267 --> 01:25:35.708]  And then you've got these 22 congressmen who have signed this letter to George Bush saying, don't go up there to Ottawa, to Montebello, Quebec, and sign any more secret agreements until you come back here to Canada, to the United States.
[01:25:36.437 --> 01:25:38.598]  Check with the United States Congress on oversight.
[01:25:39.278 --> 01:25:48.221]  See, that's why we see Robert Pastor, the tool of the globalists, the frontman minion, just like Woodrow Wilson, same type, claiming he wrote all this up.
[01:25:48.241 --> 01:25:49.742]  We've got stuff 50 years old saying it.
[01:25:50.242 --> 01:25:57.224]  That's why he's now claiming another terror attack, as you have said, is going to be the catalyst, because now they're going to claim it's to fight terror.
[01:25:57.244 --> 01:26:01.686]  I mean, that's like saying pouring gasoline on yourself and lighting it is to fight fire.
[01:26:01.706 --> 01:26:03.086]  I mean, he's got a lot of nerve.
[01:26:03.426 --> 01:26:05.067]  Well, and also, you know, Pastor
[01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:07.648]  First of all, Pastor is not just an academic.
[01:26:08.048 --> 01:26:13.991]  When he was on the National Security Council, under Jimmy Carter, he engineered the Panama Canal going to Panama.
[01:26:14.451 --> 01:26:22.234]  If we get a next Democratic administration coming in, you know, as President in the next election, 2008, Robert Pastor could be front and center.
[01:26:22.274 --> 01:26:25.275]  That's right, he is a trilateralist, a high-level minion.
[01:26:25.455 --> 01:26:31.298]  He was advising John Kerry, and he was probably going to be on the National Security Council again under a Kerry administration.
[01:26:32.158 --> 01:26:33.639]  He would pursue
[01:26:34.304 --> 01:26:42.068]  This building of a North American community and the creation of the Amero, and all those other ideas about North American community institutions.
[01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:52.114]  And then what's going on is, he did say a next 9-11 crisis, but you know, Alex, we've got a crisis brewing right now with the stock market and the dollar.
[01:26:52.534 --> 01:26:54.135]  This is a huge crisis.
[01:26:54.175 --> 01:26:55.656]  This is not a small problem.
[01:26:56.156 --> 01:27:02.380]  The irresponsible generation of credit, the money supply being pumped
[01:27:02.836 --> 01:27:12.401]  By Alan Greenspan and now by Bernanke, the Federal Reserve had an orgy of people borrowing money that shouldn't have, and they knew that that would have to come to rest.
[01:27:12.801 --> 01:27:19.345]  When that comes to roost right now, which it's doing, it's going to be three to ten trillion dollars.
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:21.721]  Just lost in the financial system.
[01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:30.844]  And by the way, I've seen them brag that the globalists were creating this credit bubble to try to sab globalization and cover up what it was really doing until it was too late.
[01:27:31.064 --> 01:27:34.805]  But they haven't gotten their architecture in place yet before it collapses.
[01:27:35.025 --> 01:27:39.546]  So when it collapses, they're not going to be at the next launch pad level to move forward with the next phase.
[01:27:39.806 --> 01:27:44.308]  And we've got to be careful because what will happen is that if the dollar collapses, you can bet
[01:27:44.748 --> 01:27:54.494]  The arguments are going to come forward saying we need to have a regional market, a regional currency, in order to compete with Europe and to be on a level footing.
[01:27:54.875 --> 01:27:59.978]  That's why this crash has occurred, because you didn't give us enough global... And by the way, that's what Pasteur said.
[01:28:00.018 --> 01:28:03.780]  He said terrorist or economics, we're going to push it in those two veins.
[01:28:04.061 --> 01:28:04.941]  You're absolutely right.
[01:28:05.281 --> 01:28:08.383]  I'm going to stay in contact with you, sir, throughout the afternoon, get some lunch.
[01:28:08.924 --> 01:28:12.326]  What time are you going to try to go into the martial law perimeter?
[01:28:12.727 --> 01:28:18.747]  I'm gonna go right now and pick up my credentials and at five o'clock I'm driving out of Ottawa headed up to Montebello.
[01:28:19.904 --> 01:28:21.525]  Five o'clock this evening, Eastern Time.
[01:28:21.845 --> 01:28:24.666]  Okay, I'm gonna call you around that time if it's okay.
[01:28:24.766 --> 01:28:25.547]  Sounds great, Alex.
[01:28:25.907 --> 01:28:27.407]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:28:27.447 --> 01:28:31.809]  People can get your book at InfoWars.com, read your columns at WorldNetDaily.com.
[01:28:31.829 --> 01:28:32.410]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:28:32.590 --> 01:28:35.011]  Thank you, and an honor and pleasure to be with you.
[01:28:35.051 --> 01:28:36.551]  I really appreciate the support.
[01:28:36.591 --> 01:28:36.992]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:28:37.092 --> 01:28:38.032]  Thank you for reporting for us.
[01:28:38.052 --> 01:28:42.374]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Connie Fogel and Howard Phillips.
[01:28:43.975 --> 01:28:44.875]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:46.876]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.889 --> 01:28:50.559]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.244 --> 01:28:58.528]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:28:58.768 --> 01:29:03.612]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:03.873 --> 01:29:05.234]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:05.394 --> 01:29:08.757]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calbin Pure Soaps?
[01:29:08.997 --> 01:29:14.162]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.

[01:29:31.697 --> 01:29:33.298]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:29:33.578 --> 01:29:34.719]  And I save big time.

[01:29:54.392 --> 01:29:56.152]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:29:56.252 --> 01:29:57.513]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:29:57.753 --> 01:30:00.594]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:30:00.934 --> 01:30:03.695]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:30:04.235 --> 01:30:10.957]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:30:53.763 --> 01:30:56.123]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[01:30:56.664 --> 01:30:58.144]  After a pedicure they look great.
[01:30:58.484 --> 01:31:02.305]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[01:31:02.765 --> 01:31:04.945]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[01:31:05.385 --> 01:31:08.706]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[01:31:09.106 --> 01:31:11.566]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[01:31:12.086 --> 01:31:13.107]  What's that name again?
[01:31:13.527 --> 01:31:14.687]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[01:31:15.087 --> 01:31:16.227]  It's CalX.
[01:31:16.667 --> 01:31:18.488]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[01:31:18.848 --> 01:31:20.688]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[01:31:21.491 --> 01:31:30.094]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[01:31:30.534 --> 01:31:36.237]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing Cal-X ointment.
[01:31:36.637 --> 01:31:47.761]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Bilo, Card Drug, H-E-B grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[01:31:48.419 --> 01:31:49.520]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[01:31:49.861 --> 01:31:50.522]  I'll be right back.
[01:31:50.662 --> 01:31:52.384]  I'm getting some callus for my heels.
[01:31:53.986 --> 01:31:57.810]  No matter how hard you try, you can't stop us now.
[01:32:01.675 --> 01:32:03.057]  No matter how hard you...
[01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:31.733]  Welcome back.
[01:32:31.773 --> 01:32:35.055]  Connie Fuggles with us for the next 10 minutes.
[01:32:35.115 --> 01:32:37.577]  Then we got Howard Phillips.
[01:32:37.637 --> 01:32:38.278]  He's also there.
[01:32:38.338 --> 01:32:43.942]  Heading up a fight against the Security and Prosperity Partnership, the North American Union.
[01:33:01.849 --> 01:33:03.130]  Connie is in her car.
[01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:05.031]  They're in Ottawa right now.
[01:33:06.212 --> 01:33:12.135]  Connie, what do you think of all the demonstrations, all the bad press in Canada, finally, that the SPP is getting?
[01:33:13.823 --> 01:33:16.645]  I don't know what the press is doing here with it.
[01:33:17.845 --> 01:33:22.287]  If there's some good press and they're finally getting some press, that's good.
[01:33:23.508 --> 01:33:36.973]  But I can just tell you that the little bit of media I dealt with today already from Canada as a result of a press conference I was on with a group of people from the United States, the Canadian media is so disappointing.
[01:33:37.034 --> 01:33:38.634]  They're clueless.
[01:33:38.654 --> 01:33:39.475]  They ask you questions.
[01:33:39.495 --> 01:33:40.255]  They're so stupid.
[01:33:40.811 --> 01:33:42.033]  I mean, it's an embarrassment.
[01:33:42.074 --> 01:33:43.797]  It's awful.
[01:33:43.877 --> 01:33:48.445]  I'm totally embarrassed that the media in Canada is so uninformed.
[01:33:48.946 --> 01:33:52.854]  And when they do ask me questions, what they want to do is sensationalize
[01:33:54.463 --> 01:34:05.732]  The fact that I'm at this press conference and they're trying to make a thing of all these diverse people coming together and it's like a sensational something because we've got to be diametrically opposed.
[01:34:05.752 --> 01:34:07.693]  How can you manage to be these bedfellows together?
[01:34:08.194 --> 01:34:12.437]  Instead of focusing on the issues, they're trying to be... Exactly.
[01:34:12.637 --> 01:34:14.499]  Look, they always try to drive wedges.
[01:34:14.559 --> 01:34:16.761]  In the Patriot community, that's what they do.
[01:34:16.801 --> 01:34:19.102]  They'll say, this person's with this group or they're with that group.
[01:34:20.123 --> 01:34:23.885]  That's exactly what they were doing to me today, and I mean, I had to say, well, just what do you mean we talk about?
[01:34:24.306 --> 01:34:27.588]  You know, we're dealing in fundamental principles, issues that are universal here.
[01:34:27.608 --> 01:34:28.468]  We're talking about freedom.
[01:34:28.488 --> 01:34:41.836]  The issue is, we got a secret meeting going on, and we got the four-year documents last year, how it is in the North American Union, and the Congress of the United States has written a letter telling Bush they don't like him being up there, don't sign secret agreements.
[01:34:42.216 --> 01:34:43.017]  That's the issue.
[01:34:43.517 --> 01:34:47.500]  Yeah, that's the issue, and the people... You know what I do?
[01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:52.024]  I just don't respond to media when they bring up points that are distractions.
[01:34:52.324 --> 01:34:55.026]  Just out of my mouth comes the issue I want to talk about.
[01:34:55.807 --> 01:35:04.334]  Well, that's what I try to do, too, to divert it, but I feel so frustrated by the fact that the media is so god-awful.
[01:35:05.763 --> 01:35:16.356]  Well, I gotta tell you, it looks like you didn't have a very good time with that huge press conference that Dr. Courtney just told us about, but he seemed to be upbeat, but I certainly understand your frustration.
[01:35:16.636 --> 01:35:20.942]  These are my questions that they came to me with after the meeting.
[01:35:21.983 --> 01:35:25.107]  The questions that were asked during the press conference and the answers that were given were superb.
[01:35:25.547 --> 01:35:26.968]  It was a superb press conference.
[01:35:26.988 --> 01:35:29.510]  The presentations were absolutely wonderful.
[01:35:30.131 --> 01:35:35.435]  All the issues that all of us who are in the know have been talking about were totally covered extremely well.
[01:35:35.835 --> 01:35:37.016]  Just extremely well.
[01:35:37.076 --> 01:35:41.380]  It was just a universal concurrence amongst us.
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:43.722]  I felt really, really proud and happy.
[01:35:44.222 --> 01:35:49.384]  To be included and so grateful and satisfied with the contribution that was being made.
[01:35:49.704 --> 01:35:58.147]  And the questions, even some of the questions, even to the press conference were, tried to be a bit divisive, but the chairman handled it really, really well and he did an excellent job.
[01:35:58.427 --> 01:36:08.711]  It was the questions from the mainstream media, Canadian media, that came to me after the fact, where they were trying to do this, like what you described, you know, differences amongst the patriot movement.
[01:36:10.516 --> 01:36:19.799]  Yeah, but rather than focus on what the establishment's always going to do, I am pleased to see a bunch of mainstream news articles here that maybe you haven't seen, Connie, because you've been busy.
[01:36:19.819 --> 01:36:20.579]  Oh, I haven't.
[01:36:20.679 --> 01:36:23.500]  You know, saying, partnership viewed as a threat to sovereignty.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.280]  Good.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.701]  Protests begin ahead of Montebello Summit.
[01:36:27.281 --> 01:36:37.044]  And then when you read deeper into these articles, it's making statements and really admitting that it is circumventing the governance and the people and our secret.
[01:36:37.584 --> 01:36:37.784]  Good.
[01:36:38.244 --> 01:36:57.588]  Well, you know, I think the fact of this press conference, that was an absolutely excellent initiative, and the material, good press packages were put together and got out to all the media, so they had a lot of information to examine, and would have helped them in the reporting that they're doing today.
[01:36:57.608 --> 01:36:59.669]  I have absolutely no question in my mind about that.
[01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:06.190]  The quality of this press conference that was put together was just superb, and so the media cannot complain that they haven't been provided with
[01:37:07.009 --> 01:37:09.471]  Documentation that's excellent.
[01:37:09.832 --> 01:37:10.632]  So I'm great.
[01:37:10.692 --> 01:37:11.073]  That's good.
[01:37:11.093 --> 01:37:11.393]  I'm good.
[01:37:11.433 --> 01:37:11.853]  I'm glad.
[01:37:11.894 --> 01:37:12.254]  Fine.
[01:37:12.314 --> 01:37:12.574]  Fine.
[01:37:12.634 --> 01:37:14.736]  How many years is it?
[01:37:14.756 --> 01:37:14.736]  2005.
[01:37:15.056 --> 01:37:17.939]  It's two and a half years since we've known about this stuff.
[01:37:17.959 --> 01:37:21.462]  And our media up here has been so absolutely stupidly silent.
[01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:23.264]  Well, here's the incredible part.
[01:37:23.544 --> 01:37:29.910]  Just like with our amnesty bill, for four months they said it's a secret bill, but just trust us, it is an amnesty.
[01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:36.432]  And then we got the bill, and I thought it would be the previous Kennedy bill, which was bad enough and was amnesty.
[01:37:36.512 --> 01:37:38.172]  It was even worse!
[01:37:39.052 --> 01:37:40.493]  It was more than amnesty.
[01:37:40.513 --> 01:37:47.274]  It was pardons for aggravated felons, instant citizenship for 12 years, Social Security cards, welfare, first visit.
[01:37:47.394 --> 01:37:51.175]  I mean, it was allowing corporations to pay to bring illegals here.
[01:37:51.195 --> 01:37:52.156]  But the point is,
[01:37:54.082 --> 01:37:55.523]  With that, they said it's secret.
[01:37:55.903 --> 01:37:57.525]  Now, it's the same thing with this.
[01:37:57.605 --> 01:38:06.191]  They signed an agreement in March of 2005, up at Crawford Ranch, outside Waco, here in Texas, just north of me.
[01:38:06.711 --> 01:38:08.713]  Then they have meetings last year in secret.
[01:38:08.813 --> 01:38:11.495]  Totally secret meetings that weren't even announced that were happening.
[01:38:12.836 --> 01:38:16.859]  And then now they have a meeting where the press isn't allowed in, and what happens is secret.
[01:38:17.219 --> 01:38:28.403]  And it's the executive branches doing it with the bureaucracies, and we've got legislative members of Parliament and Congress writing letters saying they want to know what's happening, and the executives are saying no.
[01:38:28.723 --> 01:38:30.344]  I mean, that's treason right there!
[01:38:30.364 --> 01:38:31.484]  Oh, exactly.
[01:38:31.864 --> 01:38:39.907]  And I mean, I have to compliment that there's some good leadership coming out of the state, and I'm so grateful for that, because that's going to be our salvation.
[01:38:39.927 --> 01:38:45.389]  And it's forcing, I think, it's going to force the people in Canada finally to get off their butts.
[01:38:45.829 --> 01:38:57.434]  And to do something like that, they're just so, they're so limp-wristed, lily-livered people that are elected people, aside from the ones that are complicit and are participating in the
[01:38:58.067 --> 01:38:59.068]  In the treason.
[01:38:59.468 --> 01:39:10.840]  Those others, all the rest of them that are the, you know, the underlings, they've all been running and hiding and pretending, you know, just, it's so incredible what's happened.
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:22.431]  So, what you're doing and what I'm doing and what the group today was doing and having this meeting and the whole Patriot movement in the States, it's a good movement, is giving excellent leadership and is giving hope
[01:39:22.851 --> 01:39:35.500]  I had young people come up, two young people, a certain type of media, alternative media came up to me after the press conference and they were saying, you know, well it's all so bad and there's all so much stuff that's already happened and is there any hope?
[01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.902]  Do you think we can really do anything about it?
[01:39:39.523 --> 01:39:54.703]  And you know, so I have concrete examples I can give them to the fact that things are happening in the states where there's a good resistance movement developing that has some good possibilities and that's the leadership that's going to flow into Canada and help us in here to be able to mobilize our people.
[01:39:56.224 --> 01:40:05.466]  Connie Fogel, there was a big article in Saturday's Houston Chronicle that opened the article saying Illuminati, black helicopters, Trans-Texas Corridor.
[01:40:06.046 --> 01:40:09.126]  So immediately it was, ha ha ha, these people are a bunch of nuts.
[01:40:09.666 --> 01:40:14.027]  Dr. Kornstein, myself, both were interviewed by this guy, this Ratcliffe guy.
[01:40:14.407 --> 01:40:23.909]  We gave him and emailed him the TxDOT documents and the federal documents calling it a North American superhighway, NAFTA highway,
[01:40:24.409 --> 01:40:30.633]  And then still in the article it was, well, we say this imaginary thing exists while they push it and build it.
[01:40:31.394 --> 01:40:40.640]  I mean, it's just the incredible level of denial when you try to give the press documents and they still... I mean, I sent him SPP documents.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:47.945]  I sent him, you know, articles that had links to the documents from last year where they say it's a North American integration, keep it secret.
[01:40:48.645 --> 01:40:51.667]  I mean, I know you've given those documents to the press.
[01:40:52.108 --> 01:40:52.448]  Right, right.
[01:40:52.828 --> 01:40:54.089]  How do they respond in Canada?
[01:40:55.050 --> 01:41:08.844]  They just, just as heroes do, I mean, they turn accusations that I'm nuts, that I don't know what I'm talking about, that it's just a conspiracy theory, or they just, worse yet, they just ignore it.
[01:41:08.904 --> 01:41:10.206]  That's the big thing, they ignore it.
[01:41:10.226 --> 01:41:16.773]  But it's like Mahatma Gandhi said, you know, first they ignore, then they laugh at you, and then they fight you, and then you win.
[01:41:17.449 --> 01:41:27.717]  And we just have to remember that, that they're starting to... they're at the level of ridicule, I guess, which means they're beginning to realize we're having some headway.
[01:41:28.077 --> 01:41:42.007]  But it's a pretty devastating expression of the level that our democracies have sunk when the media has totally abandoned
[01:41:42.541 --> 01:41:43.181]  It's duty.
[01:41:43.201 --> 01:41:47.804]  The mainstream media has abandoned its duty, but you know, we know about that too.
[01:41:48.324 --> 01:41:55.388]  That's why they're losing their viewership, their listenership, their readership, because they've been fully discredited.
[01:41:55.568 --> 01:41:59.351]  We'll check back in with you tomorrow as all of this develops.
[01:41:59.391 --> 01:42:00.191]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:00.511 --> 01:42:03.173]  Connie Fogel, head of the Canadian Action Party.
[01:42:03.193 --> 01:42:05.194]  We have a Lynch tour up on InfoWars.com.
[01:42:05.234 --> 01:42:06.435]  Thank you for spending time with us.
[01:42:06.655 --> 01:42:08.356]  Well, thank you for including me.
[01:42:08.416 --> 01:42:08.856]  Bye-bye then.
[01:42:09.196 --> 01:42:09.597]  You bet.
[01:42:09.617 --> 01:42:13.040]  We'll be checking in with you tonight and tomorrow as this develops.
[01:42:13.060 --> 01:42:17.144]  We just talked to Dr. Corsi, who's up there, Connie Krogel, now Howard Phillips.
[01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:24.232]  You know him as the head of Conservative USA and as one of the few true conservatives left in the Republican Party.
[01:42:24.252 --> 01:42:26.154]  The rest of them are Rockefeller globalists.
[01:42:26.714 --> 01:42:27.315]  Uh, up there.
[01:42:27.795 --> 01:42:31.858]  They're there to pacify conservatives and ensure our destruction, uh, into this new world order.
[01:42:32.078 --> 01:42:33.979]  HowardPhillips.com is also one of the websites.
[01:42:34.199 --> 01:42:50.490]  He heads up the big coalition, one of the big coalitions that's formed to fight the North American Union and the SPP, and he's been instrumental in helping get Congress past that law to try to block highway funds for NAFTA superhighways that, then again, they tell us don't exist as they, uh, try to build them.
[01:42:50.711 --> 01:42:55.634]  He's up there right now, and, uh, Howard Phillips, have you been able to get press passes in yet?
[01:42:56.722 --> 01:42:59.163]  I have not sought a press pass because I'm an activist.
[01:42:59.503 --> 01:43:01.183]  By the way, Alex, one correction.
[01:43:01.243 --> 01:43:08.625]  I left the Republican Party in 1974 and helped start what is now the Constitution Party.
[01:43:08.785 --> 01:43:16.808]  No, no, I know that, but my point is that you've been a Republican and you're one of the few Republicans, I mean, you wouldn't even say there's any connotation to Republicanism.
[01:43:17.348 --> 01:43:19.228]  Well, I have nothing to do with them.
[01:43:19.268 --> 01:43:24.550]  I left them because of my profound disagreements with their policies, not just now, but even then.
[01:43:25.171 --> 01:43:27.712]  When they expanded Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
[01:43:28.192 --> 01:43:31.052]  Absolutely, with good old Tricky Dicky there.
[01:43:32.032 --> 01:43:33.213]  Now, you're out there.
[01:43:33.273 --> 01:43:34.033]  What are you witnessing?
[01:43:34.053 --> 01:43:34.653]  What are you seeing?
[01:43:35.613 --> 01:43:39.134]  Well, we had a very successful news conference this morning.
[01:43:40.074 --> 01:43:42.614]  Amazingly well covered by the Canadian media.
[01:43:43.235 --> 01:43:45.055]  I understand Fox News in the U.S.
[01:43:45.115 --> 01:43:46.455]  is going to be picking up some of it.
[01:43:47.095 --> 01:43:50.736]  And of course, Connie Fogel and Jerry Corsi made a major contribution.
[01:43:51.554 --> 01:44:07.228]  As did Bob Park, who's a former border control agent, who is with veterans against the New World Order, and Tom DeWeese of the American Policy Center, John McManus of the John Birch Society, went extremely well.
[01:44:08.949 --> 01:44:16.636]  I'm now in my room, and I was just watching the arrival of Bush on Air Force One, and they were transferring him to a helicopter.
[01:44:17.642 --> 01:44:19.743]  When one of his Marines collapsed.
[01:44:19.824 --> 01:44:21.425]  I hope the Marine is doing well.
[01:44:21.885 --> 01:44:30.291]  But basically what we're seeing is that the veil is being lifted over these private conversations.
[01:44:30.351 --> 01:44:36.395]  They just had a commentator on one of the television stations who said, well, we all have private meetings.
[01:44:36.435 --> 01:44:39.957]  We don't want people to burst in on our private meetings.
[01:44:39.977 --> 01:44:46.862]  The difference, of course, Alex, is that these private meetings are being held by people who are supposed to be accountable
[01:44:47.403 --> 01:44:51.304]  To the citizens of the nations which we were elected to lead.
[01:44:51.324 --> 01:44:51.964]  That's right.
[01:44:52.124 --> 01:45:00.966]  They are setting policy at an executive level without the Parliament or the Congresses of the other two nations being involved.
[01:45:01.026 --> 01:45:03.586]  And last time I checked, that was called treason.
[01:45:03.646 --> 01:45:14.329]  We got the SPP documents via FOIA requests and suits from Judicial Watch last year, and they talk about keeping it secret and evolution and integration by stealth.
[01:45:14.489 --> 01:45:15.809]  Is this not treason?
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.641]  Well, under the constitutional definition of treason, it is not.
[01:45:21.322 --> 01:45:27.644]  Because under the Constitution, you have to be giving aid and comfort to our enemies.
[01:45:27.684 --> 01:45:29.465]  But the globalists are enemies of America.
[01:45:29.585 --> 01:45:30.725]  And you have to be at war together.
[01:45:31.065 --> 01:45:32.526]  So technically, it's not treason.
[01:45:32.566 --> 01:45:37.608]  But certainly, it undermines America's status as an independent constitutional republic.
[01:45:38.188 --> 01:45:45.511]  And it's something which has to be opposed, something which could very well qualify
[01:45:46.538 --> 01:45:49.440]  As an impeachable offense, although not necessarily treason.
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:54.042]  Well, I have to say, they claim we're in a war on terror with these shadowy enemies that can never be defeated.
[01:45:54.382 --> 01:45:56.283]  The perfect enemy, the perfect bogeyman.
[01:45:57.163 --> 01:46:08.128]  And then at the same time, they've built two miles of border fence, and they're giving the illegals amnesty by fiat, and they're meeting in secret to further get rid of our borders.
[01:46:08.488 --> 01:46:09.369]  I think it's treason.
[01:46:10.509 --> 01:46:12.991]  Well, it's certainly something of which I disapprove.
[01:46:13.031 --> 01:46:13.851]  And they talk about
[01:46:14.528 --> 01:46:18.210]  Harmonizing the policies of the three countries.
[01:46:18.691 --> 01:46:20.012]  Harmonizing is their word.
[01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:28.657]  There are 20 working groups that are involved with bureaucrats from the three countries.
[01:46:29.057 --> 01:46:38.903]  This is all being done under a supposed grant of executive authority under some unspecified legislation, but there is no congressional mandate for this.
[01:46:38.983 --> 01:46:42.406]  Indeed, on two occasions they've lost in Congress.
[01:46:42.686 --> 01:46:42.806]  One,
[01:46:43.587 --> 01:46:48.969]  They lost when the McCain-Kennedy-Bush bill was defeated.
[01:46:48.989 --> 01:46:54.430]  They had inserted language embracing SPP in the final hours of that debate.
[01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:57.871]  When that went down, the authorization for SPP went down.
[01:46:57.951 --> 01:47:10.355]  And then, my friend Congressman Duncan Hunter of California, a Republican, together with Congressman Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, a Democrat, introduced legislation in the form of an amendment
[01:47:10.885 --> 01:47:24.334]  Which passed overwhelmingly by a margin of 300-something to 60-something on July 24, barring the use of Transportation Department funds to advance the NAFTA superhighway or any other element.
[01:47:24.614 --> 01:47:30.618]  Meanwhile, Howard Phillips, what do you, founder of the Constitution Party, what do you think
[01:47:31.935 --> 01:47:36.298]  Of this tactic of stonewalling and lying, just like with the amnesty bill saying it wasn't amnesty.
[01:47:36.618 --> 01:47:43.262]  I think that's really backfired on them, and I wonder about their tacticians coming up with a spin machine of just outright lies.
[01:47:44.162 --> 01:47:49.906]  A, do you think they'll keep lying, and B, do you think this has been a big disaster?
[01:47:50.706 --> 01:48:00.372]  Well, unfortunately President Bush has lost whatever reputation for probity he once had, and when he speaks,
[01:48:01.581 --> 01:48:04.942]  His words are taken with a very big grain of salt.
[01:48:05.622 --> 01:48:09.483]  I do believe that we're achieving a significant breakthrough this week.
[01:48:09.563 --> 01:48:17.405]  I think that people are, for the first time, becoming aware of what is going on with the SPP, the NAU.
[01:48:17.425 --> 01:48:18.905]  There have been a number of events.
[01:48:19.485 --> 01:48:27.047]  The Hudson Institute had an event a week ago today in which Robert Pastore spoke, along with several other
[01:48:28.224 --> 01:48:48.616]  Supporters of the SPP and NAU, but there was one man there, John Fonte of Hudson, who brilliantly rebutted everything that Pastor had to say and pointed out from Pastor's own quotes, his support for a North American community, the part that he played in having a mock North American Parliament, etc.
[01:48:49.117 --> 01:48:50.838]  That was broadcast on C-SPAN.
[01:48:50.878 --> 01:48:52.178]  It was a four-hour event.
[01:48:52.999 --> 01:48:56.401]  We had superb media coverage at our news conference.
[01:48:57.339 --> 01:49:05.965]  Uh, today, when you and I finish our interview, I'm going over to the Fox television studio here in Ottawa, and they're indicating they're going to do something on TV.
[01:49:05.985 --> 01:49:10.849]  Howard Phillips, why did you, and we're about to break, I want to come back and talk to you for four more minutes on the other side.
[01:49:11.932 --> 01:49:15.294]  Why do you think that they thought that they could just lie?
[01:49:15.374 --> 01:49:18.815]  Was this the 30-40 year old model of not having talk radio or the internet?
[01:49:19.035 --> 01:49:22.577]  Where they thought they could just claim they weren't doing something and then do it by stealth?
[01:49:22.637 --> 01:49:24.578]  Because it just seems so foolish.
[01:49:25.058 --> 01:49:28.720]  Well, you know Alex, they have miscalculated incredibly.
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:37.804]  On the immigration bill, they thought they could get away with shoving an amnesty bill, a sham-desty bill, down the throats of the American people.
[01:49:37.844 --> 01:49:40.085]  But thanks to you and others on talk radio,
[01:49:40.754 --> 01:49:44.381]  The American people woke up and they suffered a humiliating defeat.
[01:49:44.662 --> 01:49:45.063]  Stay there!
[01:49:45.223 --> 01:49:50.634]  HowardPhillips.com ConservativeUSA.org He's there in Ottawa right now.
[01:49:57.216 --> 01:50:00.402]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:50:00.742 --> 01:50:02.685]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:50:03.046 --> 01:50:10.699]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:11.371 --> 01:50:18.413]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:18.834 --> 01:50:30.257]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:34.479]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:34.519 --> 01:50:36.459]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:40.641]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:55.100 --> 01:51:04.187]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[01:51:04.407 --> 01:51:15.655]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw, stagnant pond water, into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[01:51:15.975 --> 01:51:21.459]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:51:21.479 --> 01:51:21.699]  I think?
[01:51:40.183 --> 01:52:02.478]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[01:52:02.758 --> 01:52:08.942]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[01:52:09.222 --> 01:52:16.909]  The fact is, the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[01:52:17.189 --> 01:52:27.418]  So why not give your liver the help it needs with LIV52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula, prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors in over 76 countries.

[01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:57.529]  Welcome back.
[01:52:58.489 --> 01:52:59.809]  Howard Phillips is our guest.
[01:52:59.829 --> 01:53:03.670]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to have public phones.
[01:53:03.850 --> 01:53:05.130]  We'll also have a guest popping in.
[01:53:06.204 --> 01:53:10.066]  Who is the barrister, the lawyer, for families that are suing the government.
[01:53:11.787 --> 01:53:14.428]  In England, victims of 7-7 saying there's a cover-up.
[01:53:16.969 --> 01:53:34.217]  Howard Phillips, to get the SPP documents from Canada last year at the last meeting in Banff, and to have the corporate chieftains, global corporations, multinationals, there literally calling the shots, and talking about carbon taxes and the rest of it,
[01:53:35.285 --> 01:53:36.486]  And then to have denial.
[01:53:37.706 --> 01:53:39.607]  Where do you see this playing out?
[01:53:40.527 --> 01:53:46.690]  I mean, looking into your crystal ball, decades and decades, you know, tracking all this in Washington.
[01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:49.451]  I mean, you talk about it failing, stalling, slowing down.
[01:53:50.031 --> 01:53:52.072]  How do you see globalization playing out now?
[01:53:52.132 --> 01:53:54.953]  Because they even admit they're facing roadblocks everywhere.
[01:53:55.833 --> 01:53:58.134]  Well, the good news is people are beginning to wake up.
[01:53:58.174 --> 01:54:01.936]  The bad news is that there have been many steps to globalization.
[01:54:03.075 --> 01:54:15.284]  The World Trade Organization, NAFTA, the World Bank, the IMF, the UN, the International, or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, etc., etc.
[01:54:16.285 --> 01:54:20.528]  They've already made considerable progress in building their New World Order.
[01:54:21.289 --> 01:54:28.674]  And the problem is that we're in a position of stopping new adventures on their part.
[01:54:29.232 --> 01:54:33.295]  But we're not yet in a position where we're strong enough to reverse the old ones.
[01:54:33.836 --> 01:54:45.346]  And what we need to do is bring a government to power which wants to truly restore America's constitutional republic, as spelled out in the Constitution.
[01:54:46.066 --> 01:54:55.894]  And only when we have a president who is willing to cut off all foreign aid, all money to the UN, to pull back the UN Law of the Sea Treaty, etc., etc., only then
[01:54:58.431 --> 01:55:01.092]  Do we have a shot at winning this battle?
[01:55:01.132 --> 01:55:04.274]  We can slow it down now, and we're going to slow it down.
[01:55:04.294 --> 01:55:07.615]  We have a good chance to block the ratification of the Law of the Sea Treaty.
[01:55:08.095 --> 01:55:13.238]  We have a good chance to prevent them from building the North American Union.
[01:55:13.358 --> 01:55:17.519]  So the good news is, before we weren't even fighting them, the people were asleep.
[01:55:17.599 --> 01:55:20.081]  At least now, we see our numbers exploding.
[01:55:20.121 --> 01:55:24.002]  The sleeping giant is rousing itself.
[01:55:24.022 --> 01:55:25.563]  In 1993, when they were pushing NAFTA,
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:31.141]  I fought hard against it, but our people were asleep at the switch.
[01:55:31.561 --> 01:55:44.787]  And the problem is, the enemy has the front page of the newspaper, they have the lead story in the evening news, and we just have a system of tom-toms, and it takes a long time for our tale to be told to the people on our side.
[01:55:44.827 --> 01:55:46.988]  It takes a long time to get our message out.
[01:55:47.468 --> 01:55:52.530]  Thanks to talk radio, cable TV, we're in a little bit better position now.
[01:55:52.610 --> 01:55:53.730]  Direct mail is a big help.
[01:55:55.362 --> 01:55:58.146]  We're not yet strong enough to beat them, but we're making progress.
[01:56:08.856 --> 01:56:17.541]  Henry Kissinger, I was just watching him a few weeks ago on Charlie Rose, bragged, he said, well, this New World Order may fail, but we will come back with a new New World Order.
[01:56:17.581 --> 01:56:19.282]  There are many paths to it.
[01:56:19.682 --> 01:56:20.702]  And so really, that's it.
[01:56:20.742 --> 01:56:26.886]  They're just going to keep pushing and pushing and pushing, and that's why they've been so successful, is because they're dauntless.
[01:56:27.246 --> 01:56:28.927]  We've got to be dauntless on our side.
[01:56:28.967 --> 01:56:35.970]  Yeah, well, they've got the media, they've got the money, and we're fighting a non-violent guerrilla war against them.
[01:56:37.409 --> 01:56:43.411]  George Washington, in some respects, fought a guerrilla war against the British, and he ultimately prevailed by persevering.
[01:56:43.931 --> 01:56:49.253]  And Alex, you're doing a great job of waking up your audience and encouraging them to persevere.
[01:56:49.613 --> 01:56:55.175]  And by God's grace, we may at some point be able to win back our republic.
[01:56:55.315 --> 01:56:59.877]  Howard, I'd like to be able to get you to pop back in tomorrow with another report for us from Ottawa.
[01:56:59.917 --> 01:57:02.398]  Thank you so much for spending time with us, sir.
[01:57:02.678 --> 01:57:05.159]  Alex, I'm grateful for the invitation.
[01:57:05.646 --> 01:57:06.587]  I know all about you.
[01:57:06.607 --> 01:57:07.827]  I have heard so much about you.
[01:57:08.207 --> 01:57:10.468]  And this is my first opportunity to join you on the air.
[01:57:10.508 --> 01:57:11.049]  God bless you.
[01:57:11.169 --> 01:57:11.669]  God bless you.
[01:57:11.709 --> 01:57:13.690]  Maybe sometime we can have you up for a full hour when you get back.
[01:57:13.730 --> 01:57:14.030]  Take care.
[01:57:14.050 --> 01:57:14.390]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:14.410 --> 01:57:14.670]  God bless you.
[01:57:14.690 --> 01:57:20.353]  All right, we're going to come back and just, I guess, go ahead and get the next guest on.
[01:57:21.013 --> 01:57:22.934]  And we'll get into London bombing for about 20 minutes.
[01:57:22.994 --> 01:57:26.876]  I'm going to shift gears back into your calls and some economic news as well.
[01:57:27.916 --> 01:57:29.137]  The traders are meeting right now.
[01:57:34.292 --> 01:57:38.606]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNLive.com or call 877-300-7000.
[01:57:50.166 --> 01:57:50.826]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.487 --> 01:57:52.547]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.248 --> 01:57:54.389]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.009 --> 01:57:55.849]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.590 --> 01:57:58.111]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.151 --> 01:58:01.993]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.333 --> 01:58:06.435]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.988 --> 01:58:19.670]  We are now into our number three already.
[01:58:19.730 --> 01:58:22.411]  It has just exploded past us.
[01:58:23.851 --> 01:58:29.013]  We talked to Dr. Corsi, Connie Fogel, and of course Howard Phillips, all from Ottawa.
[01:58:31.034 --> 01:58:37.237]  Phillips and Fogel don't have press passes so they can't get into the armored city.
[01:58:37.257 --> 01:58:40.838]  18 mile security perimeter.
[01:58:42.879 --> 01:58:50.022]  As high treason is engaged in, as more secret agreements are sure to be signed, as they've done at each event.
[01:58:50.062 --> 01:58:52.783]  Now, the SPP agreement itself is secret.
[01:58:52.803 --> 01:58:54.503]  Can you imagine the precedent all over that?
[01:58:55.363 --> 01:59:05.107]  But we've gotten the working group memos on it, and we've gotten their minutes at the meetings, and it's all carbon tax, toll roads, handing over infrastructure, North American Union.
[01:59:06.718 --> 01:59:07.738]  Merging the militaries.
[01:59:07.938 --> 01:59:09.499]  We have the documents.
[01:59:10.079 --> 01:59:11.639]  But just like the amnesty bill.
[01:59:11.679 --> 01:59:12.620]  I keep hammering this.
[01:59:13.240 --> 01:59:15.640]  Can you believe they had an amnesty bill that was secret?
[01:59:17.981 --> 01:59:21.442]  Think of the just incredible arrogance of that.
[01:59:21.482 --> 01:59:23.923]  Well it's the same thing here.
[01:59:24.723 --> 01:59:31.865]  It's the exact same thing happening but now Congress has passed a law saying no highway funds.
[01:59:32.731 --> 01:59:40.955]  For any of the NAFTA superhighways, well they just changed the names and that's why they're calling them Trans-Texas Corridors, Oklahoma Corridors.
[01:59:42.996 --> 01:59:47.498]  Oklahoma going up into Kansas and they call it a corridor.
[01:59:48.779 --> 01:59:54.982]  So they're playing all sorts of games right now and the good news is writer for the New American Bob Dacey went
[01:59:55.589 --> 02:00:18.546]  to one of the TxDOT meetings here in Austin and it was on the agenda oh my gosh they're awake they're upset we've got a camouflage and they know we want to put toll roads toll booths on existing roads and then sure enough they announced don't worry it's just a transponder you won't have to stop and TxDOT releases documents and says a hundred and sixty eight dollars
[02:00:21.090 --> 02:00:26.115]  To drive from Dallas to Austin and back, or Austin-Dallas and back.
[02:00:26.135 --> 02:00:27.316]  160 plus dollars.
[02:00:28.277 --> 02:00:30.279]  Wait till the people get the news of this.
[02:00:30.999 --> 02:00:32.641]  Just wait till they find out.
[02:00:33.442 --> 02:00:43.992]  And it's all to fund building North American Union infrastructure, which is in 75 and 50 year leases to foreign companies.
[02:00:45.638 --> 02:00:57.466]  When we get back, we'll be taking some of your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231 on this issue, on the dollar going down again when they lowered interest rates a paltry half a percent.
[02:00:59.808 --> 02:01:01.329]  They're going to get us one way or the other.
[02:01:01.409 --> 02:01:05.411]  Where do you see this going in the future?
[02:01:05.511 --> 02:01:07.493]  Bernanke is now being criticized.
[02:01:08.594 --> 02:01:13.437]  We are also going to get into this denial
[02:01:15.010 --> 02:01:21.196]  By the Nation Magazine and now the Houston Chronicle that there is a North American Union or an SPP forming.
[02:01:21.997 --> 02:01:29.703]  Even though we gave them all the documents and the sources and the links to check it out for yourself, they just weren't interested in that.
[02:01:29.884 --> 02:01:40.113]  It's, hey, there's these stupid hillbilly hayseeds that believe basically in Rip Van Winkle.
[02:01:41.255 --> 02:01:48.479]  Now, when we get back, first thing I'm going to do is read over some questions from the PrisonPlanet.com message board forum.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:59.026]  And if you click on that and you go to the top page, the top link on the forum, forum.prisonplanet.com, it says live questions for Alex Jones.
[02:01:59.046 --> 02:02:00.847]  And there's a thousand and seven of them.
[02:02:00.867 --> 02:02:03.208]  I think I've covered thirty or forty of them in the last week.
[02:02:03.488 --> 02:02:04.229]  I can only take some of them.
[02:02:04.249 --> 02:02:05.830]  But the good part is you ask questions there.
[02:02:06.330 --> 02:02:09.692]  Other people on the forum tend to be answering them even better than I could.
[02:02:10.353 --> 02:02:13.015]  In many cases, in finding links and photos and documents.
[02:02:14.457 --> 02:02:17.159]  So I'm really glad that the forum has taken off there.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:26.547]  But there's all sorts of questions on here and I'm going to take quite a few of them on the other side.
[02:02:28.269 --> 02:02:34.695]  PrisonPlanet.com, Infowars.com, Infowars.net, JonesReport.com are the main websites.
[02:02:34.715 --> 02:02:37.317]  There's also ArnoldExposed.com, ExposingSchwarzenegger,
[02:02:40.811 --> 02:02:48.574]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:02:48.894 --> 02:02:51.676]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:02:51.956 --> 02:02:56.097]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:02:56.518 --> 02:02:57.358]  So what do you do?
[02:02:57.678 --> 02:03:02.240]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:04.862]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:03:05.343 --> 02:03:20.056]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:03:20.096 --> 02:03:27.143]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:03:27.503 --> 02:03:31.886]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:03:32.346 --> 02:03:34.128]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[02:03:34.148 --> 02:03:34.348]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:03:34.408 --> 02:03:35.889]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:03:48.664 --> 02:03:51.886]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:03:52.226 --> 02:03:54.168]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:03:54.528 --> 02:04:02.173]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:04:02.856 --> 02:04:09.899]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:04:10.299 --> 02:04:21.704]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:04:22.044 --> 02:04:25.986]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:04:26.006 --> 02:04:27.967]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:04:28.267 --> 02:04:32.109]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:40.153]  Get your copy today at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:04:45.800 --> 02:04:47.640]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:04:47.780 --> 02:04:52.942]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[02:04:53.122 --> 02:04:54.462]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:04:54.742 --> 02:05:02.904]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:05:03.124 --> 02:05:08.845]  Hear how Heart and Body Extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:05:09.025 --> 02:05:10.806]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[02:05:10.866 --> 02:05:13.028]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[02:05:13.068 --> 02:05:17.430]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[02:05:17.590 --> 02:05:19.752]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[02:05:19.812 --> 02:05:26.456]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardio back.
[02:05:29.088 --> 02:05:34.472]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:34.572 --> 02:05:36.094]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:54.313 --> 02:05:59.175]  Alright, we were going to have the guest on, who's the lawyer, it was in the BBC on Friday.
[02:05:59.875 --> 02:06:04.896]  They're suing the government over cover-ups and what really happened.
[02:06:04.916 --> 02:06:10.298]  On 7-7 represents a whole bunch of families and victims, survivors.
[02:06:10.898 --> 02:06:16.260]  We'll be getting him on, he had a family issue of some sort, so we'll be getting him on in the next few days.
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:19.021]  But that in a way is good, because we already had three guests on.
[02:06:20.220 --> 02:06:23.001]  I want to go to your phone calls and get into some of the other news.
[02:06:23.401 --> 02:06:29.102]  From the PrisonPlanet.com forum, here's a question.
[02:06:29.242 --> 02:06:37.223]  Endgame on PrisonPlanet.tv, when will Endgame be posted on PrisonPlanet.tv?
[02:06:37.783 --> 02:06:46.085]  Well, all of my films are posted at least a week before on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:47.569 --> 02:06:57.776]  And I have just signed a deal, because I know this is going to be really popular, and everyone shares their passcodes, to have Content Distribution Network deliver it to you.
[02:06:58.276 --> 02:07:08.263]  We've got two servers right now on presentplanet.tv, and that just... It's been okay most of the time, really fast downloads, but sometimes, like at 8 o'clock at night, when something new comes out, it gets a little slow.
[02:07:08.283 --> 02:07:10.565]  So we're going to be going to Content Distribution.
[02:07:12.661 --> 02:07:14.682]  You know, at least on part of the downloads.
[02:07:14.962 --> 02:07:16.663]  And so, we're setting that up next month.
[02:07:16.703 --> 02:07:18.344]  We've already figured out who we're going with.
[02:07:19.405 --> 02:07:24.347]  And so, yes, it'll be delivered to you via Content Distribution Network for download and streaming.
[02:07:26.388 --> 02:07:28.169]  It'll be in Flash and several other formats.
[02:07:29.249 --> 02:07:30.510]  Windows and QuickTime.
[02:07:31.891 --> 02:07:33.752]  And it's going to be in super high quality for you.
[02:07:34.312 --> 02:07:37.474]  There'll be a lower quality for those that dial up and wish.
[02:07:40.195 --> 02:07:41.456]  And I would say it'll be up by the 15th
[02:07:42.757 --> 02:07:43.417]  Of October.
[02:07:46.139 --> 02:07:48.940]  But it'll definitely be up within seven days.
[02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:54.163]  It'll definitely be up by I'd say the 20th, 22nd of October for sure.
[02:07:54.183 --> 02:07:56.944]  I want to give myself some time there.
[02:07:57.124 --> 02:08:03.988]  And the DVDs then will not start shipping out until like October 25th or so.
[02:08:05.529 --> 02:08:07.170]  Then they hit stores October 30th.
[02:08:10.268 --> 02:08:14.070]  The DVD's come out once a month on a Tuesday, and that Tuesday's gonna be like the 30th.
[02:08:14.250 --> 02:08:20.853]  It'll be in stores then, but we'll have it here a couple weeks before that, but won't ship it till that last week.
[02:08:21.393 --> 02:08:22.834]  And you'll be getting it by the end of the week.
[02:08:25.015 --> 02:08:30.958]  I mean, it's being mailed off today to be mastered onto a DVD and then produced, mass produced.
[02:08:31.398 --> 02:08:33.119]  So there's your answer there on Endgame.
[02:08:36.122 --> 02:08:37.283]  There's another question here.
[02:08:37.303 --> 02:08:40.966]  I'm getting a lot of these about North American Union Amero coins.
[02:08:41.686 --> 02:08:46.850]  There's a certain website that I think is disinfo on purpose.
[02:08:49.132 --> 02:08:52.174]  Because they're always, every few weeks, putting out some new hoax.
[02:08:53.015 --> 02:08:56.297]  And then they always tag it to nationalism.
[02:08:56.638 --> 02:08:58.799]  And then it makes nationalists and other people look bad.
[02:09:01.341 --> 02:09:03.403]  But we did spend about an hour
[02:09:04.739 --> 02:09:12.301]  Last week, tracking it down, these coins showed a woman sitting on top of a box with a fascist symbol.
[02:09:12.341 --> 02:09:13.921]  She's got a little bit of a torch in her hand.
[02:09:15.221 --> 02:09:17.842]  We found the site that's putting them out.
[02:09:17.882 --> 02:09:24.783]  It's a little private company, and it's a parody on fascism, like the Eagles holding Nazi thunderbolts.
[02:09:28.444 --> 02:09:30.985]  The woman's got the globe in her hand and one of the other coins.
[02:09:31.085 --> 02:09:31.885]  It is a parody.
[02:09:33.672 --> 02:09:38.116]  And I meant to get an article out on this on JonesReport.com, but Aaron has just been too busy with the film.
[02:09:39.036 --> 02:09:40.718]  We've got, like, really two writers here.
[02:09:41.638 --> 02:09:44.561]  Slickhazen doesn't do much writing except big simple words, but he has in the past.
[02:09:44.961 --> 02:09:49.124]  So we've got really Aaron Dykes and then me, and then there's Paul Watson and Steve Watson.
[02:09:49.725 --> 02:09:51.566]  But I've got the site.
[02:09:51.586 --> 02:09:57.191]  I don't have it here in front of me, but it's a site that sells them, silver coins and copper coins, and it's making fun of the New World Order.
[02:09:57.491 --> 02:09:58.472]  It's a way to get the word out.
[02:09:59.239 --> 02:10:05.302]  And, of course, the people that first put the story out knew that, but decided to be deceptive and claim these are new government coins.
[02:10:06.262 --> 02:10:07.923]  Very, very suspect.
[02:10:08.163 --> 02:10:15.927]  Very, very suspicious how that's being done.
[02:10:16.447 --> 02:10:17.088]  Here's another one.
[02:10:18.228 --> 02:10:23.931]  How is Ron Paul, the Constitution's champion, and then under it it says,
[02:10:25.734 --> 02:10:26.615]  Here's a good example.
[02:10:26.655 --> 02:10:31.919]  Legislation to de-legislate in 2007-2008 by reducing H.R.
[02:10:32.539 --> 02:10:35.961]  1096 to restore the Second Amendment rights to Americans.
[02:10:36.682 --> 02:10:37.222]  And it's H.R.
[02:10:37.443 --> 02:10:39.484]  1096 and that would restore the Constitution.
[02:10:42.166 --> 02:10:43.107]  So that's a good little point.
[02:10:43.127 --> 02:10:46.669]  I tell you, we're getting so much news and tips out of this forum.
[02:10:48.811 --> 02:10:53.794]  You know, when people post news articles and documents and bills and we go check it out and vet it and it's about 95% accurate on here.
[02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:59.593]  An example of it not being accurate is AmeriCoins, but the post isn't inaccurate itself.
[02:10:59.613 --> 02:11:01.555]  We're just asking, is this real?
[02:11:04.377 --> 02:11:09.842]  The FCC to grant licenses for new, full-power, non-commercial FM radio stations.
[02:11:09.862 --> 02:11:11.883]  I've been hearing about this forever.
[02:11:15.566 --> 02:11:19.830]  But I know several times the FCC has claimed they're going to issue
[02:11:21.494 --> 02:11:25.795]  You know, non-commercial FM licenses are below 100 watts, and they really don't issue those.
[02:11:26.536 --> 02:11:28.876]  It's more like a game they play.
[02:11:31.077 --> 02:11:31.997]  Let's just click on this one.
[02:11:32.017 --> 02:11:33.098]  I have no idea what it's going to say.
[02:11:33.118 --> 02:11:34.378]  Concerning Mushroom Clouds.
[02:11:35.958 --> 02:11:39.800]  We all know there are vast numbers of nukes in the New World Order's arsenal.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:46.802]  Most of them were built during the Cold War, and we all know that the same had control of both sides in the so-called conflict.
[02:11:46.822 --> 02:11:48.582]  Certainly the elite, with a small E,
[02:11:51.221 --> 02:11:59.283]  Wouldn't put so much time and effort and spend so much money and resources on building thousands of these things because they plan to use them on themselves.
[02:11:59.863 --> 02:12:03.343]  What other reason could there be for such a massive buildup of such devastating weapons?
[02:12:03.923 --> 02:12:04.704]  To destroy the Earth?
[02:12:06.824 --> 02:12:11.045]  Although I have no physical proof, I think they did it for that exact reason.
[02:12:11.065 --> 02:12:13.625]  To use as a last resort a method for self-destruction.
[02:12:14.105 --> 02:12:16.246]  Yeah, it's a doomsday shroud, Dr. Strangelover.
[02:12:16.706 --> 02:12:17.886]  How I learned to love the bomb.
[02:12:18.836 --> 02:12:24.621]  They are perfectly aware of the mass awakening that is taking place, and they know their reign upon Earth is coming to an end.
[02:12:25.742 --> 02:12:30.847]  And he goes on to say, you know, could they be suicidal nihilists being planning to do that?
[02:12:30.887 --> 02:12:32.408]  And elitists have actually said that.
[02:12:33.309 --> 02:12:35.110]  Like Croker and others, top futurists.
[02:12:39.854 --> 02:12:41.356]  PNAC documents talk about it.
[02:12:41.736 --> 02:12:45.039]  Other top levelists talk about using neutron bombs.
[02:12:47.967 --> 02:12:58.617]  Ministry of Defense assessment put out two months ago, which was classified, but they decided to release it, which they put out every 10 years.
[02:12:58.637 --> 02:13:00.178]  This is what they believe is going to happen.
[02:13:00.458 --> 02:13:06.744]  They said they believe there's going to be a horrible world government, mass riots and death everywhere, and bio-weapons and flash mobs.
[02:13:07.765 --> 02:13:11.768]  And they talk about using neutron bombs for population control in there.
[02:13:12.529 --> 02:13:15.031]  Dropping neutron bombs on us and using them.
[02:13:18.231 --> 02:13:23.013]  And then, of course, Dick Cheney talks about legitimizing the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[02:13:28.095 --> 02:13:29.235]  We actually had that in Endgame.
[02:13:30.476 --> 02:13:31.496]  So it's pretty amazing stuff.
[02:13:31.536 --> 02:13:33.297]  I mean, I could go all day long.
[02:13:34.458 --> 02:13:36.738]  I regret I never talked to Colonel Fletcher Prouty.
[02:13:37.499 --> 02:13:39.880]  I never got a chance to speak to him before he died.
[02:13:42.021 --> 02:13:42.841]  Should have done that.
[02:13:45.194 --> 02:13:45.774]  Here's another one.
[02:13:45.834 --> 02:13:50.836]  Where are the FEMA documents regarding the clergy and martial law?
[02:13:52.557 --> 02:13:59.800]  Because in the first article Paul wrote last week, he was so busy doing it, he put a link to the story on InfoWars that had some of them posted, but not all of them.
[02:14:01.224 --> 02:14:07.905]  Now what happened was, I was sent hundreds of pages of these, but then I was told, well don't post them all, because we're worried they'll be able to track him back.
[02:14:07.925 --> 02:14:10.766]  So then I had to be authorized to post only some of the pages.
[02:14:10.926 --> 02:14:13.126]  Pastor Butch later got authorization to post them all.
[02:14:13.506 --> 02:14:16.687]  That's on PastorButch.com, so we should put a link to those.
[02:14:16.747 --> 02:14:18.327]  But then confusion set in.
[02:14:20.028 --> 02:14:25.549]  Well, Alex says that they plan for gun confiscation, enforced inoculation, and relocation.
[02:14:27.995 --> 02:14:42.683]  Quarantine and things like that and emergencies are listed in some of the documents, but it was the preacher on air how they were telling them to get ready for gun confiscation and get ready to submit and go preach this.
[02:14:43.023 --> 02:14:44.244]  And see, now that's come out.
[02:14:45.865 --> 02:14:47.806]  And so the two get confused here.
[02:14:47.826 --> 02:14:54.630]  It's kind of like a caller called up and said, well you said it was an executive order to stop vaccines from having mercury taken out of them.
[02:14:55.220 --> 02:14:56.640]  And I don't believe I said that, by the way.
[02:14:56.660 --> 02:14:57.841]  That was a caller saying that.
[02:14:57.901 --> 02:14:58.801]  But does it matter?
[02:14:58.821 --> 02:15:00.721]  He threatened a veto.
[02:15:00.761 --> 02:15:01.462]  That's what it was.
[02:15:02.122 --> 02:15:03.362]  And then he blocked it.
[02:15:04.502 --> 02:15:06.803]  And that was admitted, and that's the bill number.
[02:15:08.903 --> 02:15:12.484]  You know, there's the opposite out there of believing anything.
[02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:13.645]  And a lot of people do that.
[02:15:13.665 --> 02:15:14.825]  You know, it's all rumors.
[02:15:14.965 --> 02:15:19.626]  I heard there's FEMA camps, instead of finding out where they're actually at, like we've done in films.
[02:15:21.967 --> 02:15:22.747]  But the opposite is,
[02:15:23.797 --> 02:15:27.800]  No matter what you show somebody or what you give them, they go, I just can't believe anything now.
[02:15:29.241 --> 02:15:36.467]  And a lot of that came out of different talk show hosts, different patriot leaders who wanted to discredit everyone but themselves because it was about egomania.
[02:15:37.507 --> 02:15:39.929]  They never had guests on their show, it was all about them.
[02:15:40.890 --> 02:15:42.611]  We've seen a lot of these people come and go.
[02:15:43.031 --> 02:15:47.695]  And then, don't trust everyone, only me, only me, I'm your man, I'm your man.
[02:15:49.312 --> 02:15:50.312]  It's really just sad.
[02:15:50.672 --> 02:15:53.593]  No, I'm here going, you are your own man and woman.
[02:15:53.653 --> 02:15:55.813]  You need to check out stuff for yourself and be leaders.
[02:15:56.013 --> 02:16:00.114]  And pick an issue, and none of you are going to be perfect, but we know the country's in a lot of trouble.
[02:16:02.975 --> 02:16:05.996]  We know that tyranny is upon us.
[02:16:06.516 --> 02:16:10.236]  Alright, we're going to break, and I'm going to come back and go to Ron, Carl, Mike, David.
[02:16:11.757 --> 02:16:12.977]  Who's caller number five there?
[02:16:15.978 --> 02:16:17.278]  Cheryl and others.
[02:16:18.146 --> 02:16:45.594]  that are patiently holding but uh... here's another one here's another uh... questions really good it says how will we stay organized when they shut down the internet well the answer is have all of my documentary films have a library of all the other patriot films that are there
[02:16:46.978 --> 02:16:53.440]  And buy a couple hundred CDs that you can burn them to, or DVDs, and have that even as a backup in the info war.
[02:16:53.480 --> 02:16:54.720]  But don't wait for that to happen.
[02:16:55.620 --> 02:16:59.781]  Start... Everything we do is multi-faceted.
[02:17:00.001 --> 02:17:01.642]  It's like four legs of a stool.
[02:17:01.742 --> 02:17:02.922]  We don't just have one leg.
[02:17:03.482 --> 02:17:04.943]  We don't just have three legs, or two legs.
[02:17:04.963 --> 02:17:07.643]  We try to have four legs, or five legs, or six legs.
[02:17:08.323 --> 02:17:11.724]  Or sit on top of a solid stool, you know, where it's carved out of wood or stone.
[02:17:11.784 --> 02:17:14.385]  I mean, we're... You know, it's solidly connected to the ground.
[02:17:15.712 --> 02:17:28.103]  And, you know, you've got books, you've got print-offs of key documents like Northwoods, you've got DVDs, you use the internet now in meet-up groups and message boards to meet people locally in your area.
[02:17:28.504 --> 02:17:34.689]  You create cadres, you try to get access to TV shows, you try to get a Saturday or Sunday local radio show.
[02:17:35.090 --> 02:17:36.751]  Buy the time if you have to, it's cheap.
[02:17:37.212 --> 02:17:39.153]  Just all of you get your own little groups going.
[02:17:40.014 --> 02:17:42.036]  And a lot of them will grow into big things real fast.
[02:17:47.381 --> 02:17:51.864]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.225 --> 02:17:56.308]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.608 --> 02:17:57.148]  We listened.
[02:17:57.468 --> 02:18:02.452]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.712 --> 02:18:03.213]  We listened.
[02:18:03.593 --> 02:18:06.615]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:07.055 --> 02:18:07.576]  We listened.
[02:18:08.036 --> 02:18:12.099]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:18:12.479 --> 02:18:12.960]  We listened.
[02:18:13.320 --> 02:18:18.564]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:18:18.964 --> 02:18:20.325]  Again, we listened.
[02:18:20.685 --> 02:18:22.267]  Introducing the Berkey Light.

[02:21:54.354 --> 02:21:56.516]  We've been telling you they were going to pop the real estate bubble.
[02:21:57.036 --> 02:21:58.657]  We got it directly from the Bilderberg Group.
[02:21:59.614 --> 02:22:00.995]  Which the media said didn't exist.
[02:22:01.495 --> 02:22:02.055]  What was it?
[02:22:02.895 --> 02:22:02.055]  2000?
[02:22:04.216 --> 02:22:10.979]  They had a New York Times article saying I was delusional and I believed in an imaginary group called the Bilderberg Group.
[02:22:11.719 --> 02:22:13.320]  I just read that with amazement, man.
[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:15.221]  It was already in the BBC even then.
[02:22:16.321 --> 02:22:18.782]  It was like they thought people just wouldn't read the newspaper.
[02:22:21.244 --> 02:22:26.626]  And now it's in major newspapers like the Houston Chronicle and the Dallas Morning News.
[02:22:30.601 --> 02:22:33.403]  It just makes my mind spin.
[02:22:34.844 --> 02:22:35.805]  And they deny everything.
[02:22:35.865 --> 02:22:37.807]  And it's not working anymore, you pack of criminals.
[02:22:39.068 --> 02:22:40.449]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:22:40.629 --> 02:22:41.329]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.990]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:43.091 --> 02:22:43.631]  Hello, Alex.
[02:22:44.031 --> 02:22:44.392]  Hey, buddy.
[02:22:45.092 --> 02:22:47.954]  I'm going to get to my main point, but I'm just going to digress for a minute.
[02:22:47.994 --> 02:22:50.576]  You might consider having a guest on who wrote a book.
[02:22:51.217 --> 02:22:52.297]  She's the former U.S.
[02:22:52.317 --> 02:22:54.119]  Under Secretary of Housing.
[02:22:56.249 --> 02:22:59.170]  And she wrote a book called The Economic Tapeworm.
[02:22:59.230 --> 02:23:02.050]  Her name is Catherine Austin Fitts, I believe.
[02:23:03.211 --> 02:23:04.811]  Magnificent guest.
[02:23:04.931 --> 02:23:09.012]  I think she'll crystallize everything and make it very clear for people if they don't understand.
[02:23:10.833 --> 02:23:12.773]  And hopefully you may have her as a guest on your show.
[02:23:12.893 --> 02:23:13.693]  I would have had her on.
[02:23:13.713 --> 02:23:14.714]  She's a really nice lady.
[02:23:14.754 --> 02:23:15.574]  I'm familiar with her work.
[02:23:16.114 --> 02:23:20.455]  She just is a fellow traveler with Rupert, so it kind of scares me off.
[02:23:20.675 --> 02:23:24.416]  I've been bit so many times, that's why I don't really associate with many people now.
[02:23:25.137 --> 02:23:28.139]  I see, but she does have some interesting things to say, I'll tell you that.
[02:23:29.480 --> 02:23:50.852]  Moving along from that, as you may or may not know, a federal judge in New York City, in Brooklyn, New York, last week, about Tuesday, rendered a decision, and this is in reference to a case that many of you listeners may be familiar with, last year, the Bloomberg administration, which is, I should say, Mayor Bloomberg of New York City,
[02:23:51.890 --> 02:24:14.291]  uh... sent basically goons into states in the american south and midwest and did a hit job a sting job of some sort uh... and there's much suspect in question about what he did small gun shops no i know and and and chicago itself the city uh... and the mayor is now doing the same thing i mean i mean these are these crime cities
[02:24:14.966 --> 02:24:19.048]  Well, I mean, we'll probably start getting taxes from Mayor Bloomberg in Texas.
[02:24:19.108 --> 02:24:20.188]  Let me go on about it.
[02:24:20.308 --> 02:24:42.877]  The federal judge last Tuesday ruled, here in New York, Judge Jack Weinstein, who by the way, anyone who knows about the history of this man, knows that basically cases where, let's say it's anti-gun versus pro-gun, let's simplify it for people, are usually shifted to him because he has a very prejudiced opinion
[02:24:43.513 --> 02:25:13.040]  against gun dealers or manufacturers so he almost almost categorically uh... rules against the second amendment and the cases are literally chopped to him uh... ruled last tuesday that the mayor of new york I want you listeners to keep this in mind the mayor of new york city can impose his local ordinances on people in other states okay
[02:25:13.777 --> 02:25:17.041]  Now, the question leads me to a second thought.
[02:25:17.582 --> 02:25:18.824]  And the second thought is this.
[02:25:19.505 --> 02:25:24.371]  We are talking about something of massive ramifications and consequences.
[02:25:24.963 --> 02:25:30.205]  When a federal judge makes case laws ruling that a local lord... Well, I'll tell you what, Ron.
[02:25:30.225 --> 02:25:32.086]  You've called for years, always with good tips.
[02:25:32.126 --> 02:25:34.386]  This is huge on the Tenth Amendment.
[02:25:35.167 --> 02:25:37.307]  This is huge on every issue.
[02:25:37.327 --> 02:25:47.331]  And it shows how they want to use rulings and lawsuits and things from New York and Chicago as fire bases to launch attacks
[02:25:48.294 --> 02:25:49.295]  on the rest of the country.
[02:25:49.315 --> 02:25:56.879]  And then once they have the argument of, well, if guns come into New York, then we can use the national laws and local laws everywhere.
[02:25:56.919 --> 02:25:57.719]  This is huge.
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:05.764]  You really should write it up in an email, send it to us, and then we would post it on Jones Report or Prison Planet and tens of thousands
[02:26:06.835 --> 02:26:11.999]  We've got hundreds of thousands, some cases millions, depending on what happens with the article.
[02:26:12.059 --> 02:26:12.920]  You never can tell.
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:15.142]  We'll see it and mobilize against it.
[02:26:15.522 --> 02:26:17.484]  I mean, listen, I need the case number, how it happened.
[02:26:17.504 --> 02:26:25.210]  I knew he was declaring that power, and I've seen that in the news, but to have a federal judge... Well, listen, let me tell you what's happening in Texas.
[02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:27.732]  First, it was a New York deal.
[02:26:27.752 --> 02:26:30.274]  They duplicated here, again, showing how that happens.
[02:26:30.294 --> 02:26:32.676]  California and New York gets duplicated everywhere.
[02:26:33.176 --> 02:26:34.397]  They said if you get a ticket,
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:36.540]  It could be one ticket, it could be three tickets.
[02:26:36.601 --> 02:26:37.881]  It's random, they said.
[02:26:38.141 --> 02:26:39.321]  The computer will decide.
[02:26:40.202 --> 02:26:49.625]  You will get not just the ticket that you fight in court, but just for getting the ticket, even if you beat it, you're going to get points.
[02:26:50.645 --> 02:26:51.365]  And it could be from $250,000 to $3,000.
[02:26:51.625 --> 02:26:53.986]  And I read this on air last year.
[02:26:54.486 --> 02:26:57.347]  And the reason I knew was I got pulled over and was given a little letter about this.
[02:26:57.747 --> 02:26:58.767]  And I was given a ticket.
[02:26:59.267 --> 02:27:01.008]  Rob Jacobson was not given a ticket.
[02:27:02.088 --> 02:27:02.869]  He just got a $250 bill.
[02:27:04.716 --> 02:27:08.078]  That says you may have not had a license, you may have not had insurance.
[02:27:09.279 --> 02:27:10.319]  But we want $250.
[02:27:10.359 --> 02:27:12.240]  No judge, no jury.
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:14.121]  We're going to turn your driver's license off.
[02:27:14.441 --> 02:27:16.723]  I mean, folks, you're a retired police officer.
[02:27:16.743 --> 02:27:19.884]  I'm going to let you come back briefly, because I want to get to all these other calls we're on.
[02:27:19.904 --> 02:27:24.687]  But just speaking to that, I mean, folks, that is just no due process, no nothing.
[02:27:25.107 --> 02:27:28.549]  It's just, it's happening everywhere.
[02:27:29.149 --> 02:27:34.072]  And then we'll get to Carl and Mike and Cheryl and Tim.
[02:27:35.834 --> 02:27:36.775]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.795 --> 02:27:38.836]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.736 --> 02:27:42.537]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:49.100]  Pinch me, Bill.
[02:27:49.381 --> 02:27:50.301]  I can't believe it.
[02:27:50.761 --> 02:27:53.563]  A few months ago, I couldn't even afford gas for my car.
[02:27:53.923 --> 02:27:56.444]  And here we are with season tickets on the 50-yard line.
[02:27:57.557 --> 02:27:58.637]  I know what you mean, John.
[02:27:58.657 --> 02:28:02.798]  I remember the day you saw my new car and asked me if I robbed Bill Gates.
[02:28:03.379 --> 02:28:07.180]  Our lives sure have changed since we discovered DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:08.820]  I was struggling to make ends meet.
[02:28:09.300 --> 02:28:14.142]  Now I've got a new car and a college fund for Lisa when she graduates from high school next year.
[02:28:14.502 --> 02:28:19.443]  And I owe it all to you because you told me about DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[02:28:19.543 --> 02:28:22.524]  Hey John, we all win when the money problems disappear.
[02:28:22.864 --> 02:28:27.507]  I want to tell everybody, because the more people we have on the success team, the better it works.
[02:28:27.887 --> 02:28:29.548]  It's hard for the little guy these days.
[02:28:29.828 --> 02:28:32.470]  We pool our resources to level the playing field.
[02:28:32.610 --> 02:28:38.813]  So the more people that go to www.DidYouRobBillGates.com, the more cash for everybody.
[02:28:39.093 --> 02:28:39.914]  What a concept!
[02:28:46.451 --> 02:28:49.552]  Hi, this is Brother Michael Diamond from Most Holy Family Monastery.

[02:29:42.004 --> 02:29:44.146]  Mostholyfamilymonastery.com
[02:29:45.563 --> 02:29:49.647]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[02:29:49.907 --> 02:29:54.972]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[02:29:55.293 --> 02:29:59.937]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[02:30:00.278 --> 02:30:02.240]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[02:30:02.540 --> 02:30:08.406]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:30:08.766 --> 02:30:09.527]  And it works.
[02:30:09.967 --> 02:30:11.427]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[02:30:11.807 --> 02:30:12.808]  Now it's your turn.
[02:30:13.068 --> 02:30:15.428]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[02:30:15.588 --> 02:30:19.849]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[02:30:20.169 --> 02:30:23.270]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[02:30:23.630 --> 02:30:25.850]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:28.371]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:30:28.431 --> 02:30:28.651]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:30:28.671 --> 02:30:30.551]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[02:30:37.873 --> 02:30:38.534]  Guaranteed.
[02:30:38.774 --> 02:30:39.014]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[02:30:39.034 --> 02:30:39.295]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[02:30:56.042 --> 02:31:01.003]  Alright, I'm going to try to finish up with Ron because this is what happens.
[02:31:01.223 --> 02:31:03.943]  Callers call in with key information.
[02:31:24.125 --> 02:31:25.706]  And then we don't ever get to the other cars.
[02:31:28.148 --> 02:31:39.877]  Before we do that, E-Food's correct, ladies and gentlemen, with all of the crises and problems and mudslides and fires and hurricanes and economic problems and talk of martial law.
[02:31:39.957 --> 02:31:41.899]  I mean, I believe in this, what I tell you here.
[02:31:43.337 --> 02:31:45.360]  And I believe you should call and get storable food.
[02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:47.062]  They got a two-month supply for one person.
[02:31:47.402 --> 02:31:48.924]  They got a two-month supply for two people.
[02:31:48.964 --> 02:31:54.530]  They got basic poultry amounts that are high quality and will get you through short emergencies.
[02:31:55.972 --> 02:31:57.353]  Everyone should have a two-month supply.
[02:31:58.735 --> 02:32:00.597]  I have a year's supply for each member of my family.
[02:32:03.314 --> 02:32:05.896]  You'd be surprised at how inexpensive it is and the quality.
[02:32:05.916 --> 02:32:06.316]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:06.336 --> 02:32:12.161]  We went out and got the very best, the longest continual company, the best quality.
[02:32:12.181 --> 02:32:14.703]  1-800-409-5633 or efoodsdirect.com, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:32:14.723 --> 02:32:16.665]  There's a banner on prisonplanet.com.
[02:32:22.685 --> 02:32:25.006]  And I've been so busy today, I haven't even really plugged my films.
[02:32:25.066 --> 02:32:26.326]  I've made 15 of them.
[02:32:26.747 --> 02:32:29.848]  Now I've put out the new edition of Terrorist Storm, available at InfoWars.com.
[02:32:30.248 --> 02:32:38.491]  That is a big part of the fight against the New World Order, and your purchase of the books and videos that we carry, and the films I've made, and the books I've written, up on InfoWars.com.
[02:32:38.811 --> 02:32:40.052]  Make what we do here possible.
[02:32:40.072 --> 02:32:41.632]  I want to thank all of you out there for your support.
[02:32:42.072 --> 02:32:43.013]  Alright, 30 seconds, we're on.
[02:32:43.093 --> 02:32:43.753]  Finish up your point.
[02:32:44.344 --> 02:32:45.725]  Okay, my point is this.
[02:32:45.825 --> 02:32:53.188]  Now that absurd and preposterous ruling is rendered, you have a federal judge giving a blessing to New York City to impose its authority on other states.
[02:32:53.828 --> 02:33:13.017]  However, how come none of the relevant organizations have weighed in on this case, come to the assistance of these small gun dealers, even if they have no particular love for these small gun dealers, the recognition of the larger ramifications of case law in this case has been established, which will have a detrimental effect
[02:33:14.748 --> 02:33:23.052]  Well, I mean, even when they were in New Orleans and surrounding areas taking guns in two states, it took about two weeks for people to even be able to admit it was happening to themselves.
[02:33:24.232 --> 02:33:26.193]  And I know that Bloomberg was trying that.
[02:33:26.253 --> 02:33:29.455]  Your news telling me he succeeded is, this is unprecedented.
[02:33:29.495 --> 02:33:31.236]  This means New York rules the entire country.
[02:33:32.176 --> 02:33:39.321]  There's a similar process that just started in New York over the last year and a half, where when people go to court, if they plead guilty on a summons,
[02:33:56.133 --> 02:34:01.802]  Uh, they think that expedites it, you pay your, your, your summons, so let's say, I don't know, speeding or something like that.
[02:34:02.563 --> 02:34:11.637]  Uh, they don't realize now that there are hidden administrative fees, and at the point in time in which they go before a judge and plead guilty, the judge does not inform them.
[02:34:12.455 --> 02:34:14.936]  Of these administrative fees that will be charged.
[02:34:15.076 --> 02:34:16.837]  Yeah, that's bad, but you're not listening.
[02:34:17.317 --> 02:34:27.702]  And points are bad because on top of your conviction or whatever and you have to pay for the fine, now there's another one they just put arbitrarily outside the courts on your driver's license renewal.
[02:34:28.142 --> 02:34:36.746]  Now they are sending out letters when you don't even get a ticket saying conviction, surcharge, notice.
[02:34:37.086 --> 02:34:38.227]  He has been convicted of nothing.
[02:34:39.208 --> 02:34:48.679]  You're saying that people are being accused of things that haven't even occurred?
[02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:49.160]  Yes.
[02:34:49.661 --> 02:34:55.487]  I'm saying, well if that's happening, then you're talking about, if that's the case, that's out now.
[02:34:55.588 --> 02:34:55.888]  Crime.
[02:34:57.439 --> 02:35:05.745]  Now, rogue criminality, if you're talking to people... Well, and they take people's children and warehouse them without beds, because they didn't take shots, and then, you know, rape them.
[02:35:05.805 --> 02:35:06.726]  I mean, that's in our news.
[02:35:06.766 --> 02:35:07.546]  This is even worse.
[02:35:07.566 --> 02:35:08.607]  That's in our news here.
[02:35:08.667 --> 02:35:10.569]  They just... We just live in living hell.
[02:35:10.609 --> 02:35:16.433]  We're just criminals running around, foaming at the mouth... People getting notices when they've had no contact, committed no offense, nothing.
[02:35:16.897 --> 02:35:19.378]  It's just like getting billed for something that you never bought.
[02:35:19.618 --> 02:35:20.579]  It's total mafia.
[02:35:20.639 --> 02:35:25.741]  I mean, it's just foaming at the mouth, insanity, men with machine guns drunkenly stomping around.
[02:35:25.761 --> 02:35:28.963]  And I just hope the cops out there listening love this system.
[02:35:29.723 --> 02:35:31.704]  I mean, they're going to take your pension funds.
[02:35:32.745 --> 02:35:34.906]  Alex, with the other issue I was discussing.
[02:35:35.461 --> 02:35:37.442]  Where are the organizations like the NRA?
[02:35:37.542 --> 02:35:39.824]  Why aren't they helping these people with the money they have?
[02:35:39.844 --> 02:35:40.684]  Ron, it's simple.
[02:35:41.165 --> 02:35:41.525]  It's simple.
[02:35:41.565 --> 02:35:43.046]  The NRA's control, we know that.
[02:35:43.106 --> 02:35:44.567]  Gun owners is too busy and too small.
[02:35:44.887 --> 02:35:46.949]  I want you to... Will you write it up and send it to me?
[02:35:47.989 --> 02:35:48.189]  Yes.
[02:35:48.590 --> 02:35:49.630]  Yes, I'll talk to... Okay.
[02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:50.051]  Okay.
[02:35:50.091 --> 02:35:50.691]  I gotta go.
[02:35:50.751 --> 02:35:51.211]  I gotta go.
[02:35:51.271 --> 02:35:51.732]  I gotta go.
[02:35:51.912 --> 02:35:52.212]  Okay?
[02:35:52.432 --> 02:35:53.393]  And I appreciate your call.
[02:35:53.873 --> 02:35:56.775]  Carl, in Montreal, Canada, you're on the air.
[02:35:56.795 --> 02:35:57.115]  Go ahead.
[02:35:58.836 --> 02:35:59.036]  Hello?
[02:35:59.277 --> 02:35:59.517]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:59.537 --> 02:35:59.817]  Go ahead.
[02:36:00.307 --> 02:36:00.807]  Yeah, I know.
[02:36:00.827 --> 02:36:03.949]  I've been up here and I'm keeping track of all these news articles.
[02:36:04.030 --> 02:36:06.191]  I mean, it's just a shame about the media up here.
[02:36:07.272 --> 02:36:07.632]  I don't know.
[02:36:07.672 --> 02:36:11.154]  I think some of the media coverage of SPP is pretty positive.
[02:36:11.194 --> 02:36:12.335]  But, I mean, what are you saying?
[02:36:13.356 --> 02:36:16.998]  Well, I see the article here about the partnership viewed as a threat to sovereignty.
[02:36:17.078 --> 02:36:20.941]  Then, yesterday's paper, they were trying to deny that there was a North American Union.
[02:36:21.536 --> 02:36:25.099]  They were criticizing the Canadian Action Party and the Minutemen.
[02:36:25.119 --> 02:36:30.222]  Yeah, last year, before it all happened, they claimed Bilderberg didn't exist in the national paper.
[02:36:30.402 --> 02:36:32.283]  Boy, did they get embarrassed when it blew up everywhere.
[02:36:32.504 --> 02:36:41.730]  There was an article the other day about how the security here at Montebello is stronger, more security than at the Bilderberg conference in Canada 20 years ago.
[02:36:41.870 --> 02:36:42.931]  Please send that to me.
[02:36:43.553 --> 02:36:47.636]  Yeah, and I had that, and they even had to shut down the local bar in Montebello.
[02:36:47.676 --> 02:36:51.159]  They said the owner of the bar said it's never been shut down in 50 years.
[02:36:51.499 --> 02:36:55.242]  No, no, no one's allowed in the town to stay in the hotels, anywhere.
[02:36:55.543 --> 02:36:57.364]  They're just, they're just, it's martial law.
[02:36:57.524 --> 02:37:03.469]  We're shutting down the town, we're shutting down the roads, 18 miles, we rule, we have machine guns!
[02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:12.695]  There's an article in the paper the other day also about if you're a Muslim, the intelligence security comes knocking at your door and asks you questions about... And again, they're pumping the Muslims in.
[02:37:12.715 --> 02:37:13.456]  I appreciate your call.
[02:37:13.796 --> 02:37:15.777]  Email it all to Aaron at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:16.938 --> 02:37:19.180]  Ryan at InfoWars.com.
[02:37:19.200 --> 02:37:20.881]  We're going to have total coverage on this.
[02:37:21.221 --> 02:37:21.541]  Help us.
[02:37:21.561 --> 02:37:22.462]  There's so many articles.
[02:37:22.502 --> 02:37:23.163]  Get them all to us.
[02:37:23.503 --> 02:37:25.824]  I really appreciate you, Carl, calling in with that info.
[02:37:25.844 --> 02:37:26.965]  You're there in Canada.
[02:37:26.985 --> 02:37:28.006]  Write us up a report.
[02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:31.051]  You know, post it in the message board.
[02:37:31.071 --> 02:37:32.211]  We'll be sure to get it that way.
[02:37:32.411 --> 02:37:34.012]  Knock us upside the head with the info.
[02:37:34.032 --> 02:37:36.793]  We're a bunch of overworked crazies here.
[02:37:36.813 --> 02:37:37.453]  We need your help.
[02:37:37.473 --> 02:37:39.154]  Alright, real fast.
[02:37:39.234 --> 02:37:40.014]  Mike in New York.
[02:37:40.515 --> 02:37:41.515]  Mike in New York, go ahead.
[02:37:42.275 --> 02:37:42.535]  Alex.
[02:37:42.996 --> 02:37:43.216]  Yes.
[02:37:43.896 --> 02:37:48.078]  I got a question, but first I want to apologize for calling in last week about the whole John Lear thing.
[02:37:49.558 --> 02:37:50.079]  It's okay, sir.
[02:37:50.099 --> 02:37:51.299]  You can call in about whatever you want.
[02:37:51.319 --> 02:37:55.901]  No, I know, but you know... You're allowed to believe in aliens and stuff.
[02:37:55.961 --> 02:37:57.001]  I mean, it might be true.
[02:37:57.021 --> 02:37:58.322]  I just don't cover it.
[02:37:58.996 --> 02:37:59.616]  Right, right, right.
[02:37:59.736 --> 02:38:03.258]  Okay, what can you tell me about Project Eyes Open?
[02:38:05.039 --> 02:38:12.363]  Well, there are several projects called Eyes Open, but you heard we had the former FBI agent on last week.
[02:38:13.483 --> 02:38:15.284]  No, no, that was Jack McClain this week.
[02:38:15.424 --> 02:38:17.085]  No, no, no, it was Jack McClain last week.
[02:38:17.565 --> 02:38:18.946]  The days all run together here, folks.
[02:38:19.286 --> 02:38:20.187]  Remember, this is Monday.
[02:38:20.907 --> 02:38:22.328]  Talking about a mind control program.
[02:38:23.348 --> 02:38:24.829]  Right, and that's currently going on right now?
[02:38:25.976 --> 02:38:32.599]  We know they got hundreds of known mind control programs that have gone on, and from everything we know, it just increases, it doesn't go away.
[02:38:33.620 --> 02:38:35.120]  Like the whole Born Supremacy thing?
[02:38:36.321 --> 02:38:37.621]  That stuff is real, yeah.
[02:38:38.142 --> 02:38:47.206]  Real quick, I live in Staten Island, New York, and they have these trucks that they're putting out through the city, and they're advertising masks for subway catastrophes.
[02:38:49.574 --> 02:38:51.935]  And they're putting these trucks all over the city over here.
[02:38:52.315 --> 02:38:53.996]  Yeah, and I appreciate your call.
[02:38:54.076 --> 02:38:55.136]  It's all psych warfare.
[02:38:55.196 --> 02:38:55.756]  Take a photo.
[02:38:55.776 --> 02:38:56.336]  Send it to us.
[02:38:56.737 --> 02:38:57.417]  Please.
[02:38:57.437 --> 02:38:58.477]  You're all reporters, folks.
[02:39:01.698 --> 02:39:02.719]  It creates fear.
[02:39:02.859 --> 02:39:03.579]  Oh, they're going to get us.
[02:39:03.659 --> 02:39:04.739]  Oh, there's a terror drill.
[02:39:05.039 --> 02:39:07.460]  And that creates fear as if, oh, the terror is real.
[02:39:07.901 --> 02:39:11.022]  I mean, this is just a mind-control state with a pack of criminals running it.
[02:39:14.111 --> 02:39:16.353]  Sherry, where are you calling from?
[02:39:16.813 --> 02:39:18.054]  For Cheryl, where are you calling from?
[02:39:18.535 --> 02:39:20.056]  I'm calling from Kansas City.
[02:39:20.196 --> 02:39:20.436]  Welcome.
[02:39:20.536 --> 02:39:21.397]  Actually, Cherylin.
[02:39:21.797 --> 02:39:23.098]  Okay, Cherylin, there you go.
[02:39:24.319 --> 02:39:27.222]  First of all, I'll just let you know I'm a fairly new listener.
[02:39:27.302 --> 02:39:30.384]  I just got tuned in to you from my friend Linda Powell.
[02:39:32.486 --> 02:39:36.969]  Even though I have known for 40 plus years that corruption in America is really bad,
[02:39:38.692 --> 02:39:40.113]  I'm learning new things like today.
[02:39:41.014 --> 02:39:44.156]  I've been flabbergasted about what I've just been listening to the last hour.
[02:39:44.176 --> 02:39:46.758]  I didn't know that was going on either.
[02:39:46.838 --> 02:39:50.421]  But anyway, I have a couple positive things that I would like to mention.
[02:39:50.821 --> 02:39:59.128]  And because I'm a new listener, you may have discussed this stuff on your show, but I'm not sure, so I'm going to put it out there.
[02:39:59.828 --> 02:40:04.992]  Anyway, I've recently found out about a company called the Liberty Dollar.
[02:40:05.733 --> 02:40:06.474]  LibertyDollar.org.
[02:40:07.535 --> 02:40:10.921]  It's a, it's a currency already in use.
[02:40:11.282 --> 02:40:13.766]  There's at least 100,000 plus people using it.
[02:40:14.327 --> 02:40:15.970]  And it's backed by silver and gold.
[02:40:16.611 --> 02:40:17.152]  Have you heard of it?
[02:40:19.031 --> 02:40:19.591]  Say that again?
[02:40:19.611 --> 02:40:23.232]  Okay, this new currency that's out there called the Liberty Dollar.
[02:40:23.492 --> 02:40:24.833]  They even have Ron Paul dollars.
[02:40:25.133 --> 02:40:25.973]  No, no, no, no.
[02:40:26.393 --> 02:40:26.993]  I know who they are.
[02:40:27.434 --> 02:40:30.455]  I had some feedback, Maren.
[02:40:30.475 --> 02:40:32.395]  I kind of missed what you said, so I'm just asking you to repeat it.
[02:40:32.755 --> 02:40:38.937]  Sometimes, there in Minnesota, I'm in Austin, Texas, and two or three times a day it cuts out or I get audio feedback, so that's just what happened.
[02:40:39.197 --> 02:40:40.458]  Yes, of course I'm aware of it.
[02:40:40.478 --> 02:40:41.398]  It's a great company.
[02:40:42.578 --> 02:40:59.026]  I think we're even going to be a sponsor of the show or at least the website because basically it's gold, it's silver, it's coins and they're very collectible and they're selling them near melt and so just as a collector's item
[02:41:00.947 --> 02:41:09.349]  I've been so busy I haven't even had time to buy any gold lately, but I do intend just to get those as a collector's item themselves.
[02:41:09.389 --> 02:41:11.090]  They are very handsome.
[02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:12.270]  What was the other point?
[02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:20.913]  Yes, and the other thing I have is another person that's got a website out there for Ron Paul, and it's called PaulForRonPaul.com.
[02:41:22.448 --> 02:41:26.670]  And he's got an especially neat website.
[02:41:26.910 --> 02:41:30.751]  He's got several links on there that all us Ron Paul supporters need to read.
[02:41:31.392 --> 02:41:34.733]  And the last one in particular is called He Can Win.
[02:41:34.753 --> 02:41:35.813]  Absolutely.
[02:41:35.873 --> 02:41:37.174]  And he gives the reasons why.
[02:41:37.194 --> 02:41:38.074]  Absolutely.
[02:41:38.114 --> 02:41:38.955]  Listen, I've got to jump.
[02:41:38.975 --> 02:41:39.595]  I've got to jump.
[02:41:39.875 --> 02:41:40.615]  Good to hear from you.
[02:41:40.655 --> 02:41:42.196]  Call me back in the next few days.
[02:41:42.216 --> 02:41:42.916]  We'll talk more.
[02:41:43.376 --> 02:41:50.059]  I just hate having to cut these great callers off because we have a special guest we're about to talk to and then we'll maybe cram one or two more calls in for Tim and others that are holding.
[02:41:53.780 --> 02:42:00.946]  On the subject of Ron Paul winning, Ron Paul is the only candidate that can beat Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama.
[02:42:01.206 --> 02:42:01.426]  Okay?
[02:42:01.447 --> 02:42:02.868]  I want to make this clear to everybody.
[02:42:03.628 --> 02:42:07.852]  The Republicans are running dead horse candidates because they intend to pass the baton to Hillary.
[02:42:08.332 --> 02:42:12.996]  They have these staged fights between Fox and Hillary or between Roe and Hillary.
[02:42:13.036 --> 02:42:14.217]  That's all staged.
[02:42:14.597 --> 02:42:15.558]  That is not real.
[02:42:15.859 --> 02:42:17.960]  The globalists are behind Hillary.
[02:42:18.641 --> 02:42:21.083]  The New World Order is behind Hillary.
[02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:23.699]  John Edwards is a Bilderberg group member.
[02:42:23.739 --> 02:42:24.320]  So is Hillary.
[02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:27.022]  He's waiting in the wings in case she has a problem.
[02:42:28.062 --> 02:42:30.624]  But Ron Paul won all the straw polls yesterday.
[02:42:30.644 --> 02:42:33.326]  Alabama, New Hampshire, Illinois.
[02:42:33.946 --> 02:42:35.087]  He is the man.
[02:42:35.988 --> 02:42:38.109]  And he's on his trajectory right now.
[02:42:38.149 --> 02:42:38.950]  We continue to support him.
[02:42:38.970 --> 02:42:39.930]  We get the word out he's going to win.
[02:42:40.350 --> 02:42:40.631]  Okay.
[02:42:41.171 --> 02:42:46.074]  That said, all that straw poll news is up on Infowars.net and prisonpanda.com right now.
[02:42:46.094 --> 02:42:49.136]  I've had him holding in the wings, so I wanted to get to your calls.
[02:42:49.937 --> 02:42:51.598]  I'm going to hold him over to the final segment.
[02:42:52.892 --> 02:43:00.257]  I called Ted Friday and I said, gold is down, I want to buy two or three little pieces, what do you got?
[02:43:01.217 --> 02:43:05.200]  And he said, I got British Sovereigns and he's got them at the price that went down.
[02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:19.228]  Now folks, what happened is the markets went into crisis so all these bigwigs that hold gold and silver and other metals as their true hedges had to dump those because a lot of them got called on the carpet during speculation.
[02:43:20.228 --> 02:43:21.109]  This was a respite.
[02:43:21.815 --> 02:43:24.737]  Now, I know, every time gold goes down, I get dead on.
[02:43:25.398 --> 02:43:26.038]  Every few months.
[02:43:26.098 --> 02:43:27.039]  And people don't listen then.
[02:43:27.079 --> 02:43:28.200]  They don't buy when I buy.
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:31.822]  You, for some reason, like to buy when it's hot and $20 more an ounce.
[02:43:33.123 --> 02:43:34.004]  It is going to go up.
[02:43:34.064 --> 02:43:35.485]  The dollar is going down.
[02:43:35.525 --> 02:43:36.866]  They're artificially suppressing gold.
[02:43:36.906 --> 02:43:38.367]  Plus, people are cashing it in right now.
[02:43:38.948 --> 02:43:40.649]  You should buy it when it's low.
[02:43:41.369 --> 02:43:43.371]  I told you to buy it when it was $310 an ounce.
[02:43:43.391 --> 02:43:44.272]  It's now $670-something.
[02:43:44.952 --> 02:43:49.736]  But the point is that now is the time before it goes well over $700.
[02:43:51.036 --> 02:43:54.737]  Okay, and if the economy goes totally belly-up, you're talking 2,000 or 3,000 an ounce.
[02:43:55.177 --> 02:43:56.577]  And I believe that.
[02:43:56.938 --> 02:43:58.938]  When I say something, I believe it.
[02:43:59.578 --> 02:44:01.239]  And that's what all the experts are saying.
[02:44:01.259 --> 02:44:02.319]  This is a no-brainer.
[02:44:03.179 --> 02:44:04.960]  I don't know why people buy things.
[02:44:05.000 --> 02:44:08.741]  It's like people like to buy a new car when it first comes out, and they're on order, and it's $50,000.
[02:44:09.321 --> 02:44:12.482]  And then a year later, the same car, brand new, is $25,000.
[02:44:12.782 --> 02:44:13.882]  I mean, I don't understand that.
[02:44:15.152 --> 02:44:20.217]  I would buy gold while it is low, and it is lower right now.
[02:44:20.717 --> 02:44:23.140]  And I don't have a lot of money either, but I'm buying three or four coins.
[02:44:23.520 --> 02:44:26.023]  And the best you can get for the price is British sovereigns.
[02:44:26.801 --> 02:44:28.362]  Man, that's the King Daddies over there.
[02:44:28.623 --> 02:44:29.924]  That's the New World Order Chieftains.
[02:44:30.544 --> 02:44:33.327]  And it's got the Evil Queen of England on it, but that doesn't matter.
[02:44:33.647 --> 02:44:41.354]  The point is that you get it very close to melt, with collector value, with British sterling power behind it.
[02:44:41.374 --> 02:44:46.698]  I mean, this is the numero uno currency on the planet at a very low price.
[02:44:46.958 --> 02:44:49.581]  Ted has put together an insanely good deal.
[02:44:49.901 --> 02:44:50.962]  This is what I'm buying.
[02:44:50.982 --> 02:44:52.163]  I'm buying some of these myself.
[02:44:52.874 --> 02:44:54.695]  I told you, Ted, keep me at least three or four of those.
[02:44:54.976 --> 02:44:55.876]  Tell folks about what you got.
[02:45:23.014 --> 02:45:24.435]  By the way, I just did this math in my head.
[02:45:24.535 --> 02:45:26.876]  That is four quarter ounce British sterling coins
[02:45:49.895 --> 02:45:50.456]  I don't know.
[02:46:03.025 --> 02:46:10.749]  British Sovereign at near melt with smaller coins, because smaller coins always cost more towards an ounce.
[02:46:10.809 --> 02:46:11.669]  Explain that, Ted.
[02:46:11.689 --> 02:46:12.470]  This is a great deal.
[02:46:12.490 --> 02:46:16.211]  Well, it's a fabulous deal, and it's one of those things that are a sleeper right now.
[02:46:16.251 --> 02:46:19.513]  British Sovereigns have had larger premiums over their melt value.
[02:46:19.553 --> 02:46:23.555]  Right now, I can get into the things, and I can get into the things practically at melt.
[02:46:23.595 --> 02:46:25.295]  It's a good way to get involved.
[02:46:25.476 --> 02:46:27.296]  It supports this particular show.
[02:46:27.356 --> 02:46:28.457]  It supports the Genesis.
[02:46:28.977 --> 02:46:32.782]  Genesis Network, everything positive comes out of this.
[02:46:33.082 --> 02:46:36.427]  There is no reason in the world right now why you should be sitting on U.S.
[02:46:36.447 --> 02:46:36.927]  currency.
[02:46:37.268 --> 02:46:42.214]  Not when you know what you know about this world and the way that a government is handling our affairs.
[02:46:42.234 --> 02:46:44.657]  I mean, we have a hope and a prayer with Ron Paul.
[02:46:45.297 --> 02:46:51.518]  And I hope that the press starts picking it up and talking about these things with a strong voice.
[02:46:51.538 --> 02:46:53.979]  In fact, you came down to Austin for his big event a few months ago.
[02:46:53.999 --> 02:46:54.839]  It was good seeing you, Ted.
[02:46:55.059 --> 02:46:56.919]  Oh yeah, well we wanted to raise money for him.
[02:46:56.959 --> 02:47:03.921]  I think we had about 900 people show up and we raised him about $100,000 and it was his first fundraiser and we launched him.
[02:47:04.101 --> 02:47:06.241]  It showed him that we're here to support him.
[02:47:06.521 --> 02:47:09.882]  Well look, bottom line folks, cash in on some of those Federal Reserve notes.
[02:47:10.472 --> 02:47:15.958]  Yeah, I've got a nice little stash and I'd like to get it in the hands of the people that are listening to this show and they can get a hold of them at 1-800
[02:47:27.614 --> 02:47:28.355]  686-2237.
[02:47:28.375 --> 02:47:29.876]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:47:32.517 --> 02:47:35.319]  Just ask for the Alex Jones Special on the British Sovereigns.
[02:47:35.679 --> 02:47:38.861]  You'll get them for $174 apiece, and it is a good buy.
[02:47:38.881 --> 02:47:39.902]  There's no question about it.
[02:47:40.282 --> 02:47:41.743]  You should be getting out of U.S.
[02:47:41.763 --> 02:47:42.244]  currency.
[02:47:42.724 --> 02:47:43.164]  Why not?
[02:47:43.204 --> 02:47:44.005]  The foreigners are.
[02:47:44.045 --> 02:47:49.248]  They've been lending us their wealth and taking our currency in exchange.
[02:47:49.268 --> 02:47:52.690]  I mean, right now, if China starts dumping the U.S.
[02:47:52.750 --> 02:47:55.312]  Treasuries into the marketplace, our housing market is gone.
[02:47:55.891 --> 02:47:58.213]  The interest rates are going to have to go up.
[02:47:58.914 --> 02:48:01.957]  The federal government here is going to have a hard time selling its current bonds.
[02:48:02.017 --> 02:48:09.024]  Well, I mean, the economy was about to tank, and everybody demanded it, and so they cut the interest rate, and that caused the dollar to tank even more.
[02:48:09.124 --> 02:48:11.426]  Well, of course, because foreigners don't want to buy U.S.
[02:48:11.466 --> 02:48:13.368]  dollars if they can't get a good interest return.
[02:48:13.408 --> 02:48:17.312]  If they're losing money based upon the inflation going up, they're not going to do it.
[02:48:17.692 --> 02:48:22.856]  Ted, give the listeners the number.
[02:48:22.876 --> 02:48:23.516]  It's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:23.556 --> 02:48:24.737]  Just look at the dollar.
[02:48:24.777 --> 02:48:25.298]  Google it.
[02:48:25.338 --> 02:48:26.098]  See what's going on.
[02:48:26.178 --> 02:48:27.499]  It's falling like a stone.
[02:48:27.519 --> 02:48:28.800]  Now is the time to go.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:29.301]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:29.321 --> 02:48:29.381]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:29.401 --> 02:48:32.223]  We'll be right back with Ted Anderson in the final segment.
[02:48:32.463 --> 02:48:32.783]  Stay with me.
[02:48:49.079 --> 02:48:54.543]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:48:54.923 --> 02:49:02.548]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:49:03.246 --> 02:49:10.289]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:49:10.709 --> 02:49:22.134]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iraq, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.434 --> 02:49:25.935]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:49:26.395 --> 02:49:28.316]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:49:28.656 --> 02:49:32.518]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:49:48.781 --> 02:49:51.541]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:49:51.821 --> 02:49:55.982]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:49:56.402 --> 02:49:57.242]  So what do you do?
[02:49:57.542 --> 02:50:02.103]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:50:02.603 --> 02:50:04.725]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:50:05.225 --> 02:50:19.915]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:50:19.955 --> 02:50:27.080]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:50:45.427 --> 02:50:50.370]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[02:50:50.690 --> 02:50:52.571]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[02:50:52.771 --> 02:50:55.813]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[02:50:55.993 --> 02:50:59.134]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[02:50:59.435 --> 02:51:01.316]  We are living in this time of Earth's history.
[02:51:01.576 --> 02:51:05.258]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[02:51:05.558 --> 02:51:08.219]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[02:51:08.840 --> 02:51:11.501]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy.
[02:51:11.661 --> 02:51:11.921]  I think so.
[02:51:30.134 --> 02:51:33.117]  Tyrants and Wars, The New World Order, and much more!
[02:51:33.417 --> 02:51:35.840]  As always, these materials are shipped to you at no charge.
[02:51:36.040 --> 02:51:36.540]  Please call 1-888-211-1715.
[02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:37.081]  That's 1-888-211-1715.
[02:51:37.101 --> 02:51:37.661]  And ask for Packet B.
[02:51:59.247 --> 02:52:00.068]  It's simple, folks.
[02:52:00.088 --> 02:52:06.733]  Smaller coins are always more valuable than bigger coins.
[02:52:25.674 --> 02:52:30.559]  And then, when it's a coin put out by a government, it's worth even more than other coins.
[02:52:31.339 --> 02:52:36.624]  And when it's British and it's gold, you're getting these at near melt.
[02:52:37.705 --> 02:52:43.451]  I mean, I was looking just last week at Krugerrands per ounce that are about the same price as this.
[02:52:43.471 --> 02:52:49.777]  You're getting four little coins that make an ounce at about the same price you get a Krugerrand, which is generally the cheapest gold out there.
[02:52:51.193 --> 02:52:54.680]  That's an oxymoron, an association with the word gold, the word cheap.
[02:52:55.502 --> 02:52:58.548]  But I really think you should call and do this deal.
[02:52:58.568 --> 02:52:59.771]  Ted, I know, is doing it.
[02:53:00.949 --> 02:53:01.410]  We're good to go!
[02:53:26.062 --> 02:53:27.244]  People ask, you know, what do you do with them?
[02:53:27.264 --> 02:53:31.949]  Well, I mean, you can bury them under the old apple tree out on the farm, or you can put them in a safety deposit box.
[02:53:31.989 --> 02:53:33.030]  I'd say break them up a bit.
[02:53:33.711 --> 02:53:34.692]  And it's just good to have them.
[02:53:35.453 --> 02:53:38.937]  And, I mean, if you can get gold chains around your neck at near melt, that's a good deal.
[02:53:38.977 --> 02:53:40.478]  But most of those have huge markups.
[02:53:40.498 --> 02:53:42.100]  See, that's the thing about coins.
[02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:43.442]  You get to know the value.
[02:53:43.862 --> 02:53:45.724]  And I'm telling you, it is a good deal.
[02:53:45.744 --> 02:53:46.865]  I don't know what else I can say.
[02:53:47.808 --> 02:53:51.611]  Ted, I believe in people having firearms, storable food, water filters, and precious metals.
[02:53:52.251 --> 02:53:53.632]  And look at what's happened to the dollar.
[02:53:53.792 --> 02:54:00.617]  I mean, I wish people, I wish I would have put more of the meager savings I've got in gold years ago.
[02:54:01.558 --> 02:54:03.620]  It's just I've been too busy to mess with such things.
[02:54:03.640 --> 02:54:07.923]  I mean, I tried to go into the bank, but they just threw a little bit of cash out, and they acted like I was some kind of space alien.
[02:54:08.463 --> 02:54:11.386]  So I've just decided to get almost all of my little savings out of the banks now.
[02:54:11.406 --> 02:54:15.350]  I mean, even the bit I had hedged in the banks, I guess, isn't safe.
[02:54:15.370 --> 02:54:18.553]  I mean, they had runs on Countrywide and other banks last week.
[02:54:18.593 --> 02:54:19.954]  I didn't even cover that today, Ted.
[02:54:20.294 --> 02:54:23.797]  Yeah, Countrywide had a big long line of people trying to draw their money out of there.
[02:54:23.878 --> 02:54:26.160]  Of course, the mortgage market is what's driving that.
[02:54:26.220 --> 02:54:27.761]  It's just going through the toilet.
[02:54:28.081 --> 02:54:31.044]  So many foreclosures, it's just risky to be in that market.
[02:54:31.084 --> 02:54:32.926]  I don't blame people for wanting to get away from it.
[02:54:33.539 --> 02:54:35.605]  But I mean it's still even risky even to have U.S.
[02:54:35.646 --> 02:54:40.400]  government securities because the darn things are losing value when foreigners are selling them.
[02:54:41.538 --> 02:54:44.319]  It's driving the market down in the bonds.
[02:54:44.440 --> 02:54:45.420]  It's killing the stock market.
[02:54:45.440 --> 02:54:45.840]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:54:45.860 --> 02:54:50.302]  They're going to try to blame subprime mortgages and adjustable rate mortgages.
[02:54:50.622 --> 02:54:53.063]  And we told you, that's going to be the red herring, folks.
[02:54:53.404 --> 02:54:54.944]  That's just the trigger they claim.
[02:54:55.204 --> 02:55:00.547]  Bilderberg, two years ago, 14 months ago, they said they were going to do this on purpose.
[02:55:00.827 --> 02:55:03.328]  They had their media come out and attack it and demonize it.
[02:55:03.648 --> 02:55:06.129]  They are trying to cause a gradual slam.
[02:55:06.449 --> 02:55:09.951]  The only reason they're coming in now and bailing the market out is they want a gradual fall.
[02:55:10.857 --> 02:55:12.037]  Yeah, that's exactly right.
[02:55:12.077 --> 02:55:15.158]  I mean, the United States dollar is not going to be the world currency.
[02:55:15.278 --> 02:55:17.939]  It's earmarked to be taken right off the slate.
[02:55:18.299 --> 02:55:20.539]  We're obviously looking at an Amaro coming up.
[02:55:20.619 --> 02:55:22.540]  I mean, come on, look at what Corsi's been saying.
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:24.260]  Shane Globalist, Shane Deal.
[02:55:24.520 --> 02:55:25.320]  Give him the number, Ted.
[02:55:25.540 --> 02:55:28.861]  Well, it's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:55:28.881 --> 02:55:30.321]  And Alex is exactly right.
[02:55:30.401 --> 02:55:32.142]  Smaller coins carry a premium.
[02:55:32.162 --> 02:55:33.182]  You can get them without it.
[02:55:33.662 --> 02:55:35.023]  And right now is a good time to do it.
[02:55:35.123 --> 02:55:40.447]  Now, a lot of people listen to this at night when they get home to the refeed at InfoWars.com.
[02:55:40.968 --> 02:55:45.831]  A lot of people, they won't have time to call it work today.
[02:55:46.131 --> 02:55:47.472]  How late are the brokers going to be there today?
[02:55:47.532 --> 02:55:48.213]  Oh, they'll be here.
[02:55:48.253 --> 02:55:50.154]  They'll be here until about 11 o'clock tonight.
[02:55:50.174 --> 02:55:51.035]  They'll be here in the morning.
[02:55:51.075 --> 02:55:51.796]  Just call in again.
[02:55:51.836 --> 02:55:53.417]  Let us know that you're interested in the special.
[02:55:53.677 --> 02:55:56.979]  Yeah, the Alex Jones special to secure the locked in right from today.
[02:55:56.999 --> 02:55:57.479]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:55:57.599 --> 02:56:04.684]  Ted Anderson, thank you for your sponsorship, your support, and offering deals like this.
[02:56:04.724 --> 02:56:09.847]  And I want to talk to you when the show ends in just one moment, because I want to secure myself four of those coins.
[02:56:10.327 --> 02:56:13.089]  Alright, God bless you all, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:19.773]  More reports from Ottawa and the whole Monticello meeting that's going on tomorrow.
[02:56:20.194 --> 02:56:21.074]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.094 --> 02:56:22.175]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[02:56:25.771 --> 02:56:30.877]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
