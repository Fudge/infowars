[00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:06.209]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.970]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.771]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:11.252]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.533]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.573 --> 00:00:17.234]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.836]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:39.730]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.934]  It's Thursday, the third day of February 2005.
[00:00:44.935 --> 00:00:47.337]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:52.161]  No guests today because I want to take time and take a lot of your calls.
[00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:53.723]  I always enjoy hearing from you.
[00:00:54.043 --> 00:01:00.689]  Whatever issue or news item or topic you want to discuss, any comments or questions, it's all welcome.
[00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.769]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:05.874 --> 00:01:06.995]  We don't screen your calls.
[00:01:07.035 --> 00:01:11.920]  We don't censor like the big establishment talk radio shows like a lot of them do.
[00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.302]  We simply want to know where you're calling from.
[00:01:15.362 --> 00:01:16.863]  And what your first name is.
[00:01:16.923 --> 00:01:21.904]  You can tell us your first name is Mickey and your last name is Mouse if you'd like.
[00:01:22.224 --> 00:01:23.325]  No, we don't want your last name.
[00:01:23.365 --> 00:01:26.806]  Just your first name so folks know who you are when you're talking.
[00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:30.567]  On the air and the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:30.587 --> 00:01:32.928]  The President, El Presidente, came out with his
[00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:52.314]  State of the Union, just on the heels of the police state coronation, I meant inauguration, and El Presidente has a plan for social security!
[00:01:53.314 --> 00:02:00.297]  And I want to know what you think of his plan, or find out if you're aware of what the plan is, and get your take on it.
[00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:07.740]  Also, he talked about some other things, like the faith-based initiative that Hillary Clinton, two weeks ago, said that
[00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.535]  said that she supported it.
[00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:24.006]  She said that she supported it because, well, it's going to federalize the churches in America and they admit, if you're a Christian church, you will have to hire a Satanist.
[00:02:24.907 --> 00:02:28.048]  Or vice versa, if you're a Satanist, you'll have to hire a Christian.
[00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:43.235]  Of course, it'll all be selectively enforced, and it will bring the religious organizations under government control, carrying out government activities, and their journey to total state-run institutions will be complete.
[00:02:44.556 --> 00:02:46.817]  And Bush says that it is bankrupt.
[00:02:46.857 --> 00:02:48.938]  Well, thank you for telling us something we already knew.
[00:02:49.318 --> 00:02:51.979]  Thanks to the government looting it, raiding it,
[00:02:52.563 --> 00:03:01.051]  It was always meant to be a supplement, but it could have been a moderate pension if the government hadn't rated every red cent as it came in.
[00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:07.037]  And don't worry, this so-called privatized system, they're going to be rating that as well.
[00:03:08.578 --> 00:03:12.742]  And of course, they've stolen any real value you've ever had in it through inflation.
[00:03:12.762 --> 00:03:15.605]  You already have the monster
[00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.626]  of inflation.
[00:03:18.786 --> 00:03:22.607]  The problem is, the green-eyed monster, I would add, steals your money.
[00:03:22.967 --> 00:03:29.509]  But the average person doesn't even know that we have inflation because the news tells us it doesn't exist.
[00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.529]  You're a conspiracy theorist if you talk about it.
[00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:39.110]  And again, I use the analogy, the example of a car 10-15 years ago, a Mustang, brand new, cost $15,000.
[00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.491]  The thing's like $30-something thousand dollars today.
[00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:49.167]  A house that was $100,000 10-15 years ago is $300-something thousand dollars on average.
[00:03:49.808 --> 00:03:51.910]  There's all kinds of inflation.
[00:03:52.991 --> 00:03:56.434]  Cup of coffee, 10-15 years ago was $0.25, $0.35.
[00:03:57.715 --> 00:04:08.545]  Dollar, now if you're at the gas station, you know, buying a cup, $1.50 for one of those small ones, I'm sorry, talls, or double speak, at Starbucks.
[00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:10.942]  Very, very serious.
[00:04:11.522 --> 00:04:13.663]  I want to go over some other areas of his speech.
[00:04:13.803 --> 00:04:17.305]  Any areas you'd like to discuss, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:22.727]  Also, CIA faces pressure to divulge ties to ex-Nazis.
[00:04:23.108 --> 00:04:25.209]  We talked about this out of UPI on Monday.
[00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:29.811]  Now it's in Reuters, and more of the full extent is starting to come out.
[00:04:30.471 --> 00:04:36.094]  And also, we will get into New Republic writer,
[00:04:37.094 --> 00:04:39.997]  Calls for anti-Bush left-wingers to be killed.
[00:04:41.918 --> 00:04:47.223]  Now, Tony, likely, at the Washington Times says, execute Cy Hirsch.
[00:04:48.044 --> 00:04:50.446]  But now I see more and more of them.
[00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:53.809]  They're speaking openly of what they like to do to anyone that disagrees with them.
[00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.729]  Kill them.
[00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.131]  Put them in forced labor camps.
[00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:57.011]  Kill.
[00:04:57.372 --> 00:04:57.852]  Kill.
[00:04:58.232 --> 00:04:58.633]  Kill.
[00:04:58.733 --> 00:04:59.574]  It's freedom.
[00:05:01.118 --> 00:05:02.659]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.901]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.041 --> 00:05:09.944]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.984 --> 00:05:14.206]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:18.349]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.370]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.812]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:23.832 --> 00:05:24.933]  The medical bills!
[00:05:26.594 --> 00:05:28.556]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.696 --> 00:05:31.738]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.821]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.262 --> 00:05:41.387]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:45.710]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.491]  Order your video today.
[00:05:47.891 --> 00:05:48.872]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:10.222]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:10.462 --> 00:06:21.710]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.534]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:27.534 --> 00:06:27.774]  No problem.
[00:06:27.994 --> 00:06:34.620]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:41.687]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:41.967 --> 00:06:43.728]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:46.051]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:49.932]  He's the T-Rex of Political Talk.
[00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:51.453]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:24.682 --> 00:08:30.166]  Alright folks, welcome to the second segment, 8 minutes, 25 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:30.186 --> 00:08:40.173]  We'll be talking about the State of the Union, where Lord Bush, leader of the democracy, Viscount of the police state,
[00:08:40.816 --> 00:08:49.980]  He got up there and told us about how he's going to take over the charges of the face-based initiatives, how they're going to take over Social Security, and just many other things.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.260]  And we have loaded phone lines.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.982]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:54.022 --> 00:09:05.867]  And if you just joined us for the first time, know I'm not a Democrat because I'm on air criticizing Lord Bush.
[00:09:07.067 --> 00:09:09.188]  I'm on the radio criticizing
[00:09:09.873 --> 00:09:23.592]  Bush, because he's not a conservative, because he's a traitor to this country, because he's a puppet of the New World Order, because he's ballooning the size of government and systematically dismantling and crushing the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:09:24.955 --> 00:09:35.724]  No matter how many times he says freedom, freedom, liberty, liberty, liberty, fighting tyranny, fighting tyranny, fighting outposts of tyranny, no matter how many times he says that, the facts are still the facts.
[00:09:36.145 --> 00:09:42.650]  I'll also talk about the Feds raising interest rates again, and get into an interesting story about this
[00:09:44.247 --> 00:09:45.728]  New Jersey jet crash.
[00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:46.748]  All survive.
[00:09:46.788 --> 00:09:47.889]  At least 14 are injured.
[00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:52.271]  In a crash of a corporate jet bound for Chicago.
[00:09:52.371 --> 00:09:53.372]  Fails to lift off.
[00:09:53.772 --> 00:09:55.153]  Crashes into a warehouse.
[00:09:56.714 --> 00:09:59.475]  And there's the plane sticking out of the building.
[00:09:59.935 --> 00:10:00.936]  What an interesting picture.
[00:10:00.956 --> 00:10:04.918]  Of course, this plane didn't disappear, but the Pentagon plane did.
[00:10:04.958 --> 00:10:08.720]  It just disappeared, literally, with just a few pieces of wreckage.
[00:10:10.701 --> 00:10:11.962]  Magic aircraft there.
[00:10:13.399 --> 00:10:42.806]  But continuing with the news, last week, Tony Blakely, editor of the editorial page of the Washington Times, former minion of Chief Congressional Neocon, and good CFR member, and Trilateral Commission minion, Newt Gingrich, well, Tony Blakely, he came out and said, we read his article on air, he said, Cy Hirsch keeps writing these articles,
[00:10:43.706 --> 00:10:45.067]  that are hurting the war effort.
[00:10:45.087 --> 00:10:47.769]  He keeps writing these stories for the New Yorker magazine.
[00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:54.833]  We need to have prosecutors seize him up and try him for treason and the penalty is death.
[00:10:56.515 --> 00:10:57.395]  Execute him.
[00:10:57.435 --> 00:10:59.116]  He's engaged in the First Amendment.
[00:10:59.677 --> 00:11:04.960]  But in that case, you know, he could argue that it was spying somehow for writing these stories.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.044]  And then on the heels of that, they had the big survey of 112,000
[00:11:13.237 --> 00:11:21.622]  High school students and 51% said the government should run the newspapers, that there should be no free speech or First Amendment.
[00:11:24.243 --> 00:11:28.646]  And 36% were even more vehement about there being no free speech.
[00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:33.108]  51% said they wanted government pre-authorization and control of everything.
[00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:37.531]  So, the Tony Blakeys are starting to take over here.
[00:11:38.524 --> 00:11:45.991]  Well, now there's been a report by New Republic writer calling for anti-Bush left-wingers to be killed.
[00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:54.840]  And then he describes going to a meeting and hearing them chant, money for jobs and education, not for war and occupation.
[00:11:55.589 --> 00:12:00.610]  And he goes on to say, I wish Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Teutonic leader, would crush them.
[00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:03.971]  I wish we could machine gun them and kill them now.
[00:12:04.671 --> 00:12:14.834]  And he just froths like it was written during some type of mad berserk rage.
[00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:16.814]  It's just incredible.
[00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:19.051]  But none of this is by accident.
[00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:28.099]  When Michael Weiner, you know him as Savage, says anybody that disagrees with the government, put them in a forced labor camp, he said that in the 60's when he was a top beatnik.
[00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:30.302]  A top leader of the 60's.
[00:12:30.902 --> 00:12:32.344]  He's always done his job.
[00:12:33.244 --> 00:12:33.605]  Okay?
[00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:34.826]  As any greaseball would.
[00:12:36.004 --> 00:12:40.185]  When any of these people do this, folks, this is to sell you on the idea.
[00:12:40.606 --> 00:12:48.908]  Meanwhile, all the FEMA and Homeland Security training is for gun owners and conservatives and homeschooling families and real, real Christians.
[00:12:49.608 --> 00:12:55.290]  That's what all the real training manuals and video we have of their training, that's what all of this is really for.
[00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:00.272]  Meanwhile, you hear it's for the Arabs and the liberals, and you go, oh well, they're traitors, let's get them.
[00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:02.612]  Well, here's the problem with that.
[00:13:02.672 --> 00:13:04.433]  You violate their rights, you're going to get
[00:13:05.057 --> 00:13:06.699]  Your rights violated.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.802]  And they really are trying to promote torture.
[00:13:10.862 --> 00:13:13.064]  They're really trying to promote secret arrests.
[00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.526]  They're really trying to promote all this.
[00:13:15.406 --> 00:13:18.249]  And this is all done by design.
[00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:23.294]  And so they're writing articles about, I wish Arnold would just seize them all.
[00:13:23.654 --> 00:13:24.815]  I wish he was my leader.
[00:13:24.875 --> 00:13:27.357]  I wish we could line them up and machine gun them.
[00:13:27.698 --> 00:13:31.281]  They're giving you an inside view into what they really want to do.
[00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:51.797]  And why they want Arnold as their archetypal figurehead on the front of their ship, on the front of their juggernaut, as their maxim, as their fulcrum, as their pinnate, their flag, their cry.
[00:13:52.177 --> 00:13:59.099]  They want that Germanic death cult vision stamped on all they do.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.360]  That's why they want him so bad.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.402]  And if you can't see it, you're blind, but he gets into hell.
[00:14:04.903 --> 00:14:07.926]  They just can't wait till Schwarzenegger crushes us.
[00:14:08.586 --> 00:14:09.387]  Crushes us!
[00:14:09.847 --> 00:14:12.810]  Can't wait till we're lined up and machine-gunned.
[00:14:13.471 --> 00:14:16.614]  Oh, we can't wait to line you up and machine-gun you!
[00:14:18.937 --> 00:14:25.783]  So every week, one week it's Ann Coulter, next week it's Michelle Malkin, next week it's Tony Blakely, every day it's Michael Wiener.
[00:14:26.724 --> 00:14:34.491]  And Sean Hannity says every child needs a microchip, oh it's so great I'm going to buy a stock in it, and we should arrest all militia members and put them in prison.
[00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:36.753]  Heard him say that many times, seen him on Fox say it.
[00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:39.455]  And the conservatives just go, YESSS!
[00:14:39.555 --> 00:14:40.356]  BLOW THEM IN!
[00:14:40.436 --> 00:14:41.256]  CAMPS!
[00:14:41.737 --> 00:14:42.497]  CAMPS!
[00:14:43.078 --> 00:14:45.900]  And Limbaugh gets up and says, Oh, torturing people to death.
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.441]  You know, it's just blowing off steam.
[00:14:48.062 --> 00:14:49.323]  Just having a little fun.
[00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:55.627]  Are you starting to figure out how out of control this is?
[00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.360]  So I'll go with that article.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.041]  Plus, drivers may have to give fingerprints.
[00:15:01.601 --> 00:15:03.162]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:15:03.622 --> 00:15:09.905]  Oh, in Oregon, they're going to standardize under the new federal law, and you'll have to thumb scan when you get your driver's license.
[00:15:09.945 --> 00:15:11.586]  See, the last few states are putting it in.
[00:15:12.386 --> 00:15:13.027]  Here's another one.
[00:15:13.567 --> 00:15:15.008]  This is out of KUTV.
[00:15:15.868 --> 00:15:18.529]  Utah troopers learn to draw blood from suspects.
[00:15:18.589 --> 00:15:25.653]  And this already happened in Oregon and Nevada, Arizona, and parts of Texas.
[00:15:26.941 --> 00:15:32.185]  As well as Colorado, you get pulled over and they have a little needle and buy a flashlight.
[00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:33.846]  Light in many cases.
[00:15:33.886 --> 00:15:37.829]  They jam the needle in and take your fluids there on the side of the road.
[00:15:38.050 --> 00:15:40.151]  Because we don't just do breathalyzers now.
[00:15:40.892 --> 00:15:42.953]  Now we take blood.
[00:15:43.714 --> 00:15:51.139]  Some Utah highway troopers are becoming medically certified to draw blood from motorists they suspect of driving while intoxicated.
[00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:51.219]  See?
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.881]  That's the new system.
[00:15:52.901 --> 00:15:56.063]  And of course it's only a step away from you're upset.
[00:15:56.849 --> 00:16:02.110]  And they'll just sit there and fire a little dart into you, and make you fall to your knees giggling with pleasure.
[00:16:02.411 --> 00:16:04.031]  That's right, now it's okay.
[00:16:04.391 --> 00:16:05.992]  Come with me to the FEMA Center.
[00:16:06.832 --> 00:16:10.333]  There'll be more drugs there, and soon you'll feel better.
[00:16:11.733 --> 00:16:13.313]  I'm not kidding, that's the federal plan.
[00:16:13.934 --> 00:16:26.017]  Blood tests are necessary because portable breath tests only detect alcohol, not drugs other than possible intoxicants, said Sergeant Lee Perry with the Weber County Office of the Highway Patrol.
[00:16:26.938 --> 00:16:31.402]  And if you do not give your blood immediately, they will forcibly take it.
[00:16:31.422 --> 00:16:35.846]  In fact, a man died last year in Arizona.
[00:16:36.627 --> 00:16:42.632]  They beat him to death when they pulled out a needle on the side of the road and said, we're taking your blood.
[00:16:43.413 --> 00:16:46.816]  And he said, no, you're not sticking a needle in me.
[00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:51.810]  And they beat him to death!
[00:16:52.571 --> 00:16:55.373]  Well, maybe he should go to a work camp if he survived.
[00:16:55.833 --> 00:16:58.256]  Why resist when the police aids Al-Qaeda?
[00:16:58.656 --> 00:17:02.699]  Anything that doesn't go along with the state's goals aids Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.862]  And if you aid Al-Qaeda, then you die.
[00:17:06.723 --> 00:17:08.745]  That's what I've been hearing from the talk show host.
[00:17:09.165 --> 00:17:11.007]  If you protest, it aids Al-Qaeda.
[00:17:11.467 --> 00:17:12.648]  You must die.
[00:17:13.169 --> 00:17:15.671]  Now it's not forced labor camp for life, it's die.
[00:17:16.317 --> 00:17:17.318]  You must die.
[00:17:18.779 --> 00:17:35.916]  So, uh, just in a few years, I know it'll come to a town near you, you get pulled over, driving home from work, you know, I work a lot of nights really late, I'm driving home one o'clock in the morning, cops are everywhere and I've been blessed not to have been pulled over, but I can imagine the future getting pulled over and they just pull out the needle and, I'm gonna put this in your vein now, boy.
[00:17:36.877 --> 00:17:38.118]  Don't give me a problem.
[00:17:38.198 --> 00:17:39.960]  It's time for me to enter your body.
[00:17:40.868 --> 00:17:42.508]  It's time for us to start the reel.
[00:17:42.768 --> 00:17:48.590]  Imagine a movie about World War II where Nazis were at bus stops with needles.
[00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:56.832]  Or at train stops, or stopping families on the road and going, we've got to check and see if you've been drinking or using drugs.
[00:17:57.132 --> 00:18:01.373]  Imagine a science fiction movie where the cops pull you over and pull out needles.
[00:18:01.853 --> 00:18:05.914]  But see, now it's just, oh, it'll stop the evil drug people.
[00:18:08.007 --> 00:18:12.489]  Your bosses bring the drugs in, people use them, and then you start doing this with needles.
[00:18:12.969 --> 00:18:14.630]  And then another one, Zenet News.
[00:18:15.531 --> 00:18:17.992]  Supermarket, let your fingers do the paying.
[00:18:18.052 --> 00:18:20.013]  It's going to be everywhere soon, they say.
[00:18:20.733 --> 00:18:24.195]  Gates, Buffett, and China run from the dollar.
[00:18:24.235 --> 00:18:26.876]  They begin dumping the dollar wholesale.
[00:18:29.217 --> 00:18:30.898]  But don't worry, none of that matters.
[00:18:30.938 --> 00:18:33.099]  American Idol tops network coverage.
[00:18:34.167 --> 00:18:45.256]  For State of Union, more people watched American Idol than they watched Lord Bush, but I mean, I think American Idol's more real than Bush's speech, so maybe that actually makes sense in a way.
[00:18:45.676 --> 00:18:50.400]  Oh, the Georgian premier died of carbon monoxide poisoning at his home.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.601]  Sure, we believe it.
[00:18:52.742 --> 00:18:53.082]  Mm-hmm.
[00:18:53.842 --> 00:18:55.404]  Foul play has been ruled out.
[00:18:56.284 --> 00:18:59.347]  Oh, okay, well, if they say so, then I guess so.
[00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:01.392]  Documents U.S.
[00:19:01.972 --> 00:19:03.973]  condoned Iraq oil smuggling.
[00:19:04.413 --> 00:19:06.975]  Well, as I said, of course, coffee animals stealing oil.
[00:19:07.495 --> 00:19:08.716]  And of course, our government was.
[00:19:09.256 --> 00:19:12.818]  And both sides point their fingers at each other when they're both working for the same people.
[00:19:13.678 --> 00:19:14.479]  There is so much news.
[00:19:14.499 --> 00:19:24.124]  We're going to come back just directly and go to your calls, John, Jason, John, Mike, Evan, and everybody else.
[00:19:24.184 --> 00:19:26.305]  We're going to take a ton of your calls today.
[00:19:26.325 --> 00:19:28.346]  Going to give each caller about a minute or so.
[00:19:29.924 --> 00:19:37.608]  And of course the websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com, and don't forget Infowars.net!
[00:19:37.648 --> 00:19:42.991]  Got a great webmaster over there doing a fabulous job as well, Infowars.net.
[00:19:43.011 --> 00:19:45.313]  A lot of different news on each site.
[00:19:46.013 --> 00:19:54.878]  Some of the same news of course on every site as well, but there's more webmasters, more websites, more information, more tools in the Infowars.
[00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:57.980]  Stay with us, we'll be right back on the other side.
[00:20:02.515 --> 00:20:09.818]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:20:10.178 --> 00:20:14.859]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:18.941]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[00:20:19.181 --> 00:20:22.122]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:38.119]  Super Silver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:20:38.459 --> 00:20:44.746]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:20:45.146 --> 00:20:48.408]  Call International Health for your free audio information package at 1-800-974-1879.

[00:21:01.169 --> 00:21:07.395]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.856 --> 00:21:15.623]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:23.831]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:24.131 --> 00:21:28.892]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:29.232 --> 00:21:33.913]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.453 --> 00:21:38.294]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.794 --> 00:21:39.794]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.874 --> 00:21:43.955]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:00.595 --> 00:22:03.477]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:22:03.837 --> 00:22:06.699]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:22:06.939 --> 00:22:13.143]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:22:13.503 --> 00:22:20.828]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:22:21.008 --> 00:22:25.071]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[00:22:56.281 --> 00:23:03.003]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.663 --> 00:23:10.305]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:23:11.485 --> 00:23:13.786]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:23:14.586 --> 00:23:20.648]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crime.
[00:23:21.704 --> 00:23:29.829]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:23:30.829 --> 00:23:38.694]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:41.116 --> 00:23:41.436]  That's 1-800-5736.
[00:23:49.172 --> 00:23:50.232]  516-8736.
[00:23:50.392 --> 00:23:54.454]  Call now.
[00:23:54.594 --> 00:23:57.415]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:07.719 --> 00:24:10.481]  Alright folks, coming up.
[00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:13.722]  Lawmaker Ukraine sold Iran and China nukes.
[00:24:15.675 --> 00:24:16.455]  Very interesting.
[00:24:16.495 --> 00:24:21.717]  Also, CIA faces pressure to divulge its ties to ex-Nazis inside of Reuters today.
[00:24:22.297 --> 00:24:23.737]  That and a lot more is coming up right now.
[00:24:23.757 --> 00:24:26.418]  Let's plunge into your phone calls.
[00:24:27.138 --> 00:24:29.078]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:24:29.138 --> 00:24:29.698]  Go ahead.
[00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:30.859]  Hello, Alex.
[00:24:31.199 --> 00:24:31.519]  Hello.
[00:24:32.519 --> 00:24:35.280]  I just got through reading a book by James A. Weschler.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.561]  He's a former communist, and it was published in 1953.
[00:24:38.921 --> 00:24:43.722]  And he said that one of the slogans that the communists and socialists had in the 1930s was the New Freedom.
[00:24:44.488 --> 00:24:47.530]  Which I guess is the new freedom we're seeing today that President Bush is talking about.
[00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:53.113]  Yeah, look, go listen to a show I did five years ago, and I joke and go, oh, our new freedom!
[00:24:53.494 --> 00:24:54.494]  It's a new freedom!
[00:24:54.915 --> 00:24:56.676]  Orwell talks about new freedom.
[00:24:56.956 --> 00:25:00.478]  That's why, I mean, I didn't invent the term new freedom, I just popularized it.
[00:25:00.838 --> 00:25:03.860]  Little did I know, Bush was setting up a commission called New Freedom.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:08.263]  Look, Bush called himself a communitarian in his own literature.
[00:25:08.583 --> 00:25:12.886]  Stuff mailed to my home, because I'd given money to Republicans years ago, so I stole the mailing list.
[00:25:13.593 --> 00:25:15.654]  And I'm a communitarian.
[00:25:15.695 --> 00:25:19.497]  Well, you go to a new dictionary, it just says one that promotes communities.
[00:25:19.817 --> 00:25:24.300]  You go to one that's ten years old or older, it says one that promotes communist forms of government.
[00:25:24.921 --> 00:25:28.263]  It's a big joke to them to just throw all this in our face.
[00:25:29.644 --> 00:25:36.629]  I had the father of supply-side economics and Reaganomics on two days ago, and he was saying,
[00:25:37.563 --> 00:25:45.847]  That, yes, the Communist Fourth International founded the neocons, and he was saying, yes, they're creating a world government, and yes, it's all happening.
[00:25:46.287 --> 00:25:55.831]  Another thing he said in there, that the communists that left the party went ahead to embrace extreme conservatism, neo-fascism he called it.
[00:25:55.931 --> 00:26:00.013]  That's it, and look, that's what Mr. Winensky talked about yesterday.
[00:26:00.033 --> 00:26:04.595]  That's right, and that's what I think that the people that Bush has got around him, the neo-conservatives,
[00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:06.916]  Look, look, look, look, look.
[00:26:07.317 --> 00:26:13.121]  Michael Savage was one of the most vicious, slimy beatniks of the 60's.
[00:26:13.181 --> 00:26:14.302]  He was a leader.
[00:26:15.283 --> 00:26:15.703]  Okay?
[00:26:16.624 --> 00:26:18.045]  And then now, look what he's doing today.
[00:26:18.105 --> 00:26:19.707]  Put people in camps, do all this.
[00:26:19.907 --> 00:26:21.248]  He talks like a weatherman.
[00:26:22.009 --> 00:26:26.212]  But he adds a few little conservative things to it that make you think it's okay.
[00:26:26.792 --> 00:26:28.053]  They're very slick, sir.
[00:26:28.634 --> 00:26:30.335]  They're very sophisticated.
[00:26:30.676 --> 00:26:33.318]  How do you think that they were going to win and take over conservatives?
[00:26:34.096 --> 00:26:34.737]  That's what he had to do.
[00:26:34.997 --> 00:26:42.083]  Another thing, Alex, I read in New Reader's Digest, they say that Chicago is completely wired for surveillance.
[00:26:42.464 --> 00:26:45.547]  They said there's nowhere in that town you can go where they can't keep an eye on you.
[00:26:45.587 --> 00:26:47.809]  Yeah, and it's smart cameras there.
[00:26:47.849 --> 00:26:49.410]  It's the face scanning and the rest of it.
[00:26:49.751 --> 00:26:50.631]  So is Austin.
[00:26:51.072 --> 00:26:52.233]  So are most states.
[00:26:52.253 --> 00:26:54.995]  30 states now have license plate scanning cameras.
[00:26:55.736 --> 00:26:58.779]  They put the system in, then they start taxing you with it.
[00:26:59.409 --> 00:27:02.151]  Oh yeah, for folks that don't mind being watched, they're going to tax you with it.
[00:27:02.471 --> 00:27:03.992]  And I mean big time, thanks for the call.
[00:27:04.352 --> 00:27:09.174]  The whole wave of the future in taxation is cashless.
[00:27:09.735 --> 00:27:14.878]  And it's all face scans, license plate scans, RFID scans, and satellite tracker box scans.
[00:27:16.158 --> 00:27:17.059]  So, enjoy yourselves.
[00:27:17.779 --> 00:27:19.060]  Jason in Arizona.
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.441]  Jason, go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:27:20.721 --> 00:27:27.625]  Hi Alex, I didn't get a chance to watch the whole State of the Union, but what I did see last night at the beginning, he's talking about
[00:27:29.082 --> 00:27:35.485]  I guess claims about frivolous lawsuit claims, and he said something along the lines of frivolous asbestos claims.
[00:27:36.025 --> 00:27:43.288]  Kind of like saying that, you know, the charges that people make about it being poisonous and what it does is just false.
[00:27:43.388 --> 00:27:44.988]  And I couldn't believe he said that.
[00:27:45.088 --> 00:27:49.930]  Well, they admit that the towers were built out of asbestos, that it was the main insulation.
[00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.731]  It's admitted that asbestos is deadly.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.281]  And yeah, all over the country they built these buildings with it.
[00:27:56.821 --> 00:28:03.883]  And there are people who go and complain when they've worked in a building for a month and the asbestos is sealed up and it's negligible.
[00:28:03.923 --> 00:28:04.883]  It's still not good for you.
[00:28:05.723 --> 00:28:06.703]  But there is a problem.
[00:28:06.743 --> 00:28:08.123]  Look, look, look.
[00:28:08.384 --> 00:28:09.404]  I was talking to my grandmother.
[00:28:09.424 --> 00:28:12.244]  When she was growing up, they didn't know what allergies were.
[00:28:13.285 --> 00:28:14.925]  They didn't know what allergies were.
[00:28:15.899 --> 00:28:20.522]  Okay, I know people who are 75 years old who've never had allergies who've gotten them in the last five years.
[00:28:21.022 --> 00:28:24.184]  I never had allergies living in the country outside Dallas.
[00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:26.886]  I moved to Austin, you know, they claim it's all the pollen.
[00:28:27.146 --> 00:28:28.227]  No, it's other stuff.
[00:28:28.247 --> 00:28:29.508]  It all compounds together.
[00:28:29.728 --> 00:28:31.849]  There is so much particulate in the air.
[00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:35.672]  And look, they admit those buildings were built out of it.
[00:28:35.932 --> 00:28:40.295]  The new scientists did CAT scans of the firefighters' lungs.
[00:28:40.575 --> 00:28:41.916]  They're full of asbestos.
[00:28:41.936 --> 00:28:42.876]  They're dead and dying.
[00:28:44.938 --> 00:28:46.199]  14 of the dogs have died.
[00:28:46.219 --> 00:28:49.041]  The search dogs, almost.
[00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:50.242]  It's insane!
[00:28:50.282 --> 00:28:51.002]  Go ahead.
[00:28:51.082 --> 00:28:58.147]  And I was going to ask you, I didn't get a chance to listen to the rest of it and I had a question about the Social Security.
[00:28:58.187 --> 00:29:09.075]  Now I talked to a friend who has a site similar to yours, just publishing the truth out there, and she said there's nothing wrong with Social Security, that Bush is actually lying about it.
[00:29:10.252 --> 00:29:11.293]  Well, what's your take on that?
[00:29:11.313 --> 00:29:25.587]  Well, I've interviewed a lot of economists and a lot of congressmen and women, and there is something wrong with Social Security, but it's like, it's like, you know, the government cut our hand off, and they go, oh, there's a problem here, let's cut your legs off now.
[00:29:27.089 --> 00:29:29.311]  So, Social Security is fixable,
[00:29:30.225 --> 00:29:31.385]  But they're not going to fix it.
[00:29:31.405 --> 00:29:32.425]  They're going to bust it open.
[00:29:32.445 --> 00:29:34.586]  Yeah, it's not going to be there for me when I get that age.
[00:29:35.086 --> 00:29:36.986]  There's going to be absolutely nothing for you.
[00:29:37.366 --> 00:29:39.127]  Well, let me try to break this down after the break.
[00:29:39.187 --> 00:29:40.347]  Really good questions, Jason.
[00:29:40.647 --> 00:29:42.647]  We'll come back and I'll talk about Social Security.
[00:29:42.667 --> 00:29:45.848]  Then we'll get to John and Mike and Evan and others.
[00:29:46.348 --> 00:29:46.748]  Stay with us.
[00:29:46.768 --> 00:29:48.228]  We'll be back with more of your calls, more news.

[00:32:09.051 --> 00:32:13.292]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:32:13.512 --> 00:32:20.554]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.934 --> 00:32:27.036]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.176 --> 00:32:28.396]  There are no side effects.

[00:32:49.941 --> 00:32:50.161]  Call today.
[00:33:06.079 --> 00:33:18.041]  Alright, I'll try to be brief in my opinion of Social Security, then we'll go to all your calls.
[00:33:19.982 --> 00:33:26.383]  Number one, the government has no business paying out a pension to the general public.
[00:33:26.423 --> 00:33:30.784]  Now, if you've worked for the government for your life, or you've been disabled in combat,
[00:33:31.754 --> 00:33:33.515]  I believe that you should be paid a pension.
[00:33:33.955 --> 00:33:36.256]  And the government can set up its own pension funds and do that.
[00:33:36.636 --> 00:33:39.037]  Congress has its own pension fund.
[00:33:39.717 --> 00:33:41.457]  The President has his own pension fund.
[00:33:41.778 --> 00:33:43.758]  They've done that separately for themselves.
[00:33:44.498 --> 00:33:48.820]  And then you can take part of your paycheck and pay into that and that can be part of the benefits.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.460]  They can supplement it.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:51.981]  And then they can invest it.
[00:33:53.001 --> 00:33:57.843]  And there, of course, should be the same rules on governing that pension fund that we've had on private pension funds.
[00:33:59.458 --> 00:34:06.561]  Now that we're, you know, into the social security system, you should know that they set it up from the very beginning as a way to get people to buy into government control.
[00:34:07.402 --> 00:34:13.264]  It's about institutionalizing the population, getting you on the reservation or the plantation.
[00:34:13.925 --> 00:34:23.469]  And after a generation, the Native Americans that lived on these reservations, you know, got very dependent, went from being very upright, independent people to be very dependent,
[00:34:24.119 --> 00:34:34.823]  And they would go to the Indian Affairs office and get their goods and they were cheated and manipulated and controlled and most of the money that was supposed to go to them was stolen.
[00:34:36.019 --> 00:34:49.122]  And so it would have just been better for him to, you know, to go somewhere privately and, you know, go into business or, you know, squat out in the bush wherever and, you know, try to eke out a living there than live on the reservation.
[00:34:49.602 --> 00:34:52.003]  It's the same thing with black people in this country.
[00:34:52.503 --> 00:34:59.165]  They have their own thriving, vibrant businesses, very upright, very low level of illegitimacy and births.
[00:35:00.009 --> 00:35:05.473]  And the government comes by with the Great Society and the rest of it, and, oh, we're going to give you some help.
[00:35:05.953 --> 00:35:10.056]  You can't have a man in the house if you want this money, knowing that would break up the society.
[00:35:10.076 --> 00:35:13.899]  It's the same thing they had, you know, 200 years ago with slaves.
[00:35:14.259 --> 00:35:19.823]  The men were kept in one area and weren't allowed to be educated, and the women were kept in another area and brought into the house.
[00:35:20.575 --> 00:35:23.076]  And it's the same thing today with the media and the culture.
[00:35:23.116 --> 00:35:27.778]  They always have the black woman in charge and the black man following her orders.
[00:35:27.978 --> 00:35:30.819]  Well, it's the same thing for every other color of people now.
[00:35:31.099 --> 00:35:32.520]  That's what modern feminism is.
[00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:38.963]  It's teaching us, the men, how to live out in the barn and the women, they get to come into the house of government control.
[00:35:40.143 --> 00:35:41.364]  Hitler said it best.
[00:35:41.544 --> 00:35:44.445]  And the globalists have followed his cue.
[00:35:44.765 --> 00:35:49.467]  First you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[00:35:51.232 --> 00:35:54.014]  That's right, old Volkeinreich, I'm sure.
[00:35:54.134 --> 00:35:55.355]  First you get the women.
[00:35:55.655 --> 00:35:57.496]  Then you got the children.
[00:35:57.957 --> 00:35:59.238]  Then follow the men.
[00:36:00.699 --> 00:36:02.820]  And so it's all about dependency.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:13.007]  I mean, folks, I have handbooks written by the Romans 2,000 years ago, republished by sugar cane plantation owners in 1820.
[00:36:15.299 --> 00:36:17.319]  How to control your slaves.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:25.621]  And you take it, and you look at a welfare state today, and these government wards, and the way they operate.
[00:36:25.701 --> 00:36:28.082]  You just need to read that book for yourself.
[00:36:28.482 --> 00:36:30.562]  I've read large excerpts of it on air before.
[00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:36.584]  This is very, very serious people, and they know what they're doing.
[00:36:36.644 --> 00:36:41.985]  So, I've told the story of how you domesticate wild hogs, or how you capture them.
[00:36:42.734 --> 00:36:58.302]  You know, over the last couple hundred years, thousands of pigs have gotten loose and after a few generations out in the woods, they grow tusks to root up the things they eat, the grubs and roots and things that they eat, the tumors that they eat.
[00:37:00.383 --> 00:37:06.787]  And they grow long hair and they run around and they bust into your fields and can just decimate a field overnight.
[00:37:06.807 --> 00:37:08.528]  And they're horrible creatures!
[00:37:09.449 --> 00:37:11.290]  They're out of control in many areas of the country.
[00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:13.271]  And there's no season on them.
[00:37:13.311 --> 00:37:14.452]  You can shoot them anytime you want.
[00:37:15.092 --> 00:37:19.294]  But, again, you go up and sit in a deer stand and wait for a bunch of pigs to come by.
[00:37:19.334 --> 00:37:20.295]  You hope they come by.
[00:37:20.775 --> 00:37:21.915]  And 20 of them run out.
[00:37:21.996 --> 00:37:27.298]  And even if you've got a good rifle, semi-automatic, you can only shoot 5 or 6 of them by the time they get back in the woods.
[00:37:27.338 --> 00:37:28.239]  I've done it personally.
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.301]  Well, again, because they destroy fields.
[00:37:32.321 --> 00:37:38.344]  Then we all load them up on the back of a flatbed dually and take them to the local poor folks who like to butcher them and eat them.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.203]  I personally really wouldn't touch them, generally, because they're covered with ticks and everything else you can imagine.
[00:37:43.223 --> 00:37:44.244]  But people like them.
[00:37:45.044 --> 00:37:46.285]  Now, okay, there you go.
[00:37:46.305 --> 00:37:47.946]  See, I can't tell a story simply.
[00:37:47.986 --> 00:37:52.089]  I start imaging this stuff in my mind as we're trying to tell you, you know, the whole story.
[00:37:52.129 --> 00:38:04.277]  But the point is, what a lot of people do is you build a little pin, a pretty good sized pin with those little interlocking fence sections, and you put an electronic door on it, an automatic door with a timer.
[00:38:05.198 --> 00:38:08.400]  But before you do that, you put a timed corn feeder
[00:38:09.557 --> 00:38:10.138]  Out front.
[00:38:10.718 --> 00:38:13.600]  And it might take a month of you running that thing on a timer.
[00:38:14.281 --> 00:38:15.582]  The pigs start showing up.
[00:38:15.602 --> 00:38:17.543]  The wild hogs start showing up every morning.
[00:38:18.264 --> 00:38:18.944]  They'll be waiting.
[00:38:18.964 --> 00:38:20.265]  They're smarter than dogs.
[00:38:20.766 --> 00:38:22.547]  They'll be waiting to eat the corn.
[00:38:22.587 --> 00:38:24.248]  And then you slowly move it back.
[00:38:24.629 --> 00:38:26.310]  Then you move it into the pen.
[00:38:27.381 --> 00:38:32.484]  And then the pigs, first the little piglets and then some of the younger sows.
[00:38:33.045 --> 00:38:35.406]  First you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[00:38:35.747 --> 00:38:39.269]  The sows go in there first, and the piglets follow them.
[00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:48.135]  And they start eating, and then after a few days, the boars, the older hogs, they start going in.
[00:38:48.155 --> 00:38:49.896]  And as soon as they go in, everybody goes in.
[00:38:50.637 --> 00:38:55.480]  And then you just do it where five minutes after the feeder goes off, the gate swings shut.
[00:38:56.044 --> 00:38:57.124]  It's got a timer on it.
[00:38:57.524 --> 00:39:02.165]  And man, when you show up, and you've got to be there right after it closes, because they'll freak out and start digging under.
[00:39:02.185 --> 00:39:08.887]  And you've got to show up and basically either run them into a big trailer, but they're vicious.
[00:39:08.947 --> 00:39:10.807]  I mean, they'll kill dogs, they'll attack you.
[00:39:10.827 --> 00:39:14.768]  Usually you just walk up and machine gun them, basically.
[00:39:15.348 --> 00:39:17.809]  And then, you know, take them off to folks to be butchered.
[00:39:20.453 --> 00:39:24.135]  And by machine gun you need, you know, one person with a semi-automatic rifle.
[00:39:24.415 --> 00:39:26.416]  You don't want two people with semi-automatic rifles.
[00:39:27.297 --> 00:39:28.958]  And so this is what, because that could be dangerous.
[00:39:29.979 --> 00:39:33.902]  That's how you hunt hogs, too, on horseback with dogs, is one person's got a gun.
[00:39:34.202 --> 00:39:36.503]  You can't have ten people on horses with all of them with guns.
[00:39:36.563 --> 00:39:37.064]  It's dangerous.
[00:39:37.364 --> 00:39:39.145]  I've done that before, so it's a lot of fun.
[00:39:39.305 --> 00:39:40.286]  It's a real way to hunt.
[00:39:41.206 --> 00:39:42.627]  I've been on hunts where this is happening.
[00:39:42.667 --> 00:39:46.650]  I've never done it myself, but you ride up on the hogs, and the dogs have got them.
[00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:52.534]  You usually pit bulls, and you jump off the horse and run up with a big old carbide spear and stab the hog.
[00:39:52.554 --> 00:39:54.535]  I mean, if you really want to hunt, that's the way to do it.
[00:39:56.116 --> 00:40:02.258]  Alright, now you see I've got loaded phone lines here, and I'm trying to talk about Social Security, but now I'm off in hog hunting.
[00:40:02.378 --> 00:40:06.179]  So, let me just stop right there for now.
[00:40:06.459 --> 00:40:09.680]  The point is, this is what Social Security was.
[00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:21.725]  They trained you to get in the pen, they trained you to give them your own money, and let the government, oh trust me, I'll take care of you, and then now they've shut the pen door,
[00:40:22.651 --> 00:40:27.915]  And they know you're squealing and freaking out, and so they tell you, hey, that's alright, we're going to privatize it.
[00:40:28.356 --> 00:40:32.939]  We're going to take part of your money, part of it, and put it in private corporations.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:44.488]  Well, the problem is they've changed the rules where they can take that from you, or inflation can steal that from you, or with the pension funds they're saying now that you don't own those, any corporation can take your pension fund with no liability.
[00:40:44.728 --> 00:40:46.190]  They changed that rule two years ago.
[00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:49.052]  And so they've set all this up.
[00:40:50.006 --> 00:41:04.196]  Whereas, you know, the best thing to do is to simply tell the American people that Social Security for people, you know, over the age of 40 no longer exists.
[00:41:04.596 --> 00:41:05.597]  You're not going to get the money.
[00:41:05.617 --> 00:41:07.518]  I mean, this is being honest, by the way.
[00:41:08.219 --> 00:41:09.340]  Pull out of the scam now.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:17.986]  We're going to pay the people off who've already signed on to this, and then it's up to you to take your money and invest it and do with it what you're going to do.
[00:41:19.088 --> 00:41:20.629]  You go, well, a lot of folks aren't going to do that.
[00:41:21.130 --> 00:41:22.611]  Well, you're not going to get it anyways.
[00:41:23.351 --> 00:41:24.432]  I mean, they're not good folks.
[00:41:24.812 --> 00:41:26.394]  20, 30 years from now, you're not getting anything.
[00:41:27.194 --> 00:41:30.336]  So the best thing you can do is just invest it yourself.
[00:41:30.737 --> 00:41:31.297]  And you know what?
[00:41:31.377 --> 00:41:39.944]  If you don't invest it and you have a problem when you get older, then that's for the local social welfare net, which you're supposed to have a social welfare net.
[00:41:39.984 --> 00:41:41.205]  It's just not supposed to be federal.
[00:41:42.265 --> 00:41:44.687]  And we're so addicted to this corn
[00:41:46.317 --> 00:41:49.520]  That they give us that we just can't see the forest for the trees.
[00:41:50.581 --> 00:41:54.765]  And, again, I'm not a socialist, so I don't believe in all this.
[00:41:55.666 --> 00:42:05.074]  But Bush has doubled the growth rate, actually more than doubled the growth rate of the Department of Education, of the Justice Department, 80 plus percent increase in abortion funding.
[00:42:05.595 --> 00:42:06.936]  I mean, everything is increasing.
[00:42:07.737 --> 00:42:11.921]  And they looted Social Security a long time ago,
[00:42:13.539 --> 00:42:16.062]  Total security has been bankrupt for a long time.
[00:42:16.702 --> 00:42:19.085]  All there are are receipts in the trust fund.
[00:42:19.425 --> 00:42:20.987]  The money doesn't go in bank accounts.
[00:42:21.676 --> 00:42:30.700]  The dollar is plunging, our industrial base is gone, and no amount of Schwarzenegger or Bush going, don't be economic gully men!
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.341]  Our economy is doing just great!
[00:42:33.782 --> 00:42:37.623]  Look, they said 20 years ago we would fail, and look how good we're doing!
[00:42:37.964 --> 00:42:45.887]  Yes, record corporate, and private, and public debt, and just society and family breaking down, and giant prisons everywhere.
[00:42:46.107 --> 00:42:47.388]  Look, I'm not trying to be negative.
[00:42:47.768 --> 00:42:53.251]  But I'm tired of them, continuing with the pig analogy, with putting perfume on a pig.
[00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:56.993]  And the globalism is destroying this country.
[00:42:58.333 --> 00:42:59.494]  It's destroying this country.
[00:43:00.054 --> 00:43:12.781]  And by the time you figure that out, there's going to be a total police state in place, and you're going to be swiping your card to buy and sell, and there's not going to be much you can do, because the neocons are all over TV and radio saying, kill anyone that disagrees with the government.
[00:43:13.141 --> 00:43:15.902]  They're now saying kill, not just imprison, but kill.
[00:43:16.302 --> 00:43:17.343]  If you disagree with the government,
[00:43:17.887 --> 00:43:19.588]  We want to line you up and machine gun you.
[00:43:19.628 --> 00:43:21.249]  They're openly... See, they'd like to do this.
[00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:24.091]  They'd like to... Folks, this is what they do.
[00:43:24.431 --> 00:43:25.252]  This isn't a joke.
[00:43:26.272 --> 00:43:26.672]  Okay?
[00:43:26.973 --> 00:43:28.113]  They see you as animals.
[00:43:28.173 --> 00:43:29.154]  They see you as cattle.
[00:43:30.115 --> 00:43:32.816]  They see us like I see those wild hogs.
[00:43:33.577 --> 00:43:33.877]  Okay?
[00:43:33.897 --> 00:43:37.219]  I mean, literally, just coldly, this is what they do.
[00:43:37.259 --> 00:43:37.999]  They breed us.
[00:43:38.039 --> 00:43:38.900]  They control us.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:40.581]  This is who they are.
[00:43:40.621 --> 00:43:44.083]  This is what... Let's just rifle through your calls as quickly as possible.
[00:43:45.184 --> 00:43:46.024]  John in New York.
[00:43:46.064 --> 00:43:46.345]  Go ahead.
[00:43:46.365 --> 00:43:46.825]  You're on the air.
[00:43:47.686 --> 00:43:48.807]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:43:48.867 --> 00:43:54.028]  I'd like to make three points about the Economist guest that you had on the other day.
[00:43:55.509 --> 00:43:56.629]  Yes, Mr. Wineski.
[00:43:56.829 --> 00:43:58.770]  Yes, but first I'd like to ask you a question.
[00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:06.913]  A friend of mine told me that the speech that Bush won gave where he
[00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:32.685]  formally introduced the new world order and you have uh... you uh... it was on september eleventh nineteen ninety in my film road to tyranny i say ninety one that's a typo one of four that's in the film and that is going to be fixed in the new edition of road to tyranny that i'm releasing after martial law comes out but it was september eleventh nineteen ninety when he first introduced the new world order and uh...
[00:44:34.306 --> 00:44:40.709]  Yes, and the World Trade Center construction started on September 11th, and so did the Pentagon.
[00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:49.353]  It's amazing, you know, we talk about numerology for this crowd, and it's amazing that, you know, how strongly they're into it.
[00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:51.014]  But I just wanted to bring that up.
[00:44:52.115 --> 00:44:59.098]  The three points about the economist you had on, first of all, he gave himself away when he talked about
[00:44:59.711 --> 00:45:02.952]  Macroeconomics, that means nothing but the bottom line.
[00:45:03.012 --> 00:45:11.514]  He was the one telling Eastman Kodak to bulldoze their buildings and build new factories in China, which is what they did.
[00:45:11.794 --> 00:45:15.475]  I don't agree with Mr. Winensky's economic program.
[00:45:15.995 --> 00:45:17.856]  I mean, I agree with him.
[00:45:17.876 --> 00:45:18.716]  Let me just say this.
[00:45:19.056 --> 00:45:22.937]  The point is that Karl Rove calls him for advice.
[00:45:23.457 --> 00:45:24.099]  Well, I know that.
[00:45:24.179 --> 00:45:26.423]  I wasn't inferring that you were.
[00:45:26.503 --> 00:45:26.944]  No, no, no.
[00:45:26.964 --> 00:45:28.287]  I'm just explaining why I had him on.
[00:45:28.908 --> 00:45:35.841]  I had him on because he was openly saying it's world government, it is a conspiracy, it is a new world order.
[00:45:36.984 --> 00:45:48.757]  My second point is that he said he agreed with Bush's policies, which means he's a complete and open free trader, and he would support the new freed area of the Americas.
[00:45:48.777 --> 00:45:52.922]  Well, to be clear, he said he supports Bush more than he supported Kerry.
[00:45:53.542 --> 00:45:58.905]  Even though he voted for Kerry because he was against the war, which he admitted was dumb because Kerry was for the war.
[00:45:58.925 --> 00:46:01.586]  You know, he's a guy trying to grow a conscience.
[00:46:02.006 --> 00:46:05.008]  He mentioned the Economic Hitman Confessions book.
[00:46:05.388 --> 00:46:08.190]  So he's trying to go public about the New World Order.
[00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:11.111]  And, I mean, I think he's being genuine overall.
[00:46:11.511 --> 00:46:16.854]  Well, okay, the last point I want to make is that he's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:46:16.914 --> 00:46:17.354]  I know that.
[00:46:17.755 --> 00:46:18.095]  I know that.
[00:46:18.935 --> 00:46:22.317]  And for anybody who is interested, if you call the CFR,
[00:46:23.149 --> 00:46:29.153]  In New York City, they publish an annual every single year that has a complete membership list.
[00:46:29.714 --> 00:46:33.516]  And if you call their number and ask for an annual, they will send you one for free.
[00:46:33.836 --> 00:46:34.217]  Yeah, I know.
[00:46:34.257 --> 00:46:37.499]  Here locally, Bob Dacey orders that every year from them.
[00:46:38.374 --> 00:46:40.635]  And Limbaugh says the group doesn't exist.
[00:46:41.295 --> 00:46:42.096]  Yeah, I'm right.
[00:46:42.496 --> 00:46:42.996]  I've heard him.
[00:46:43.016 --> 00:46:47.198]  It doesn't exist, and if you talk about it, you're secretly a Klan member.
[00:46:47.638 --> 00:47:00.424]  Whenever I hear somebody on C-SPAN or something, and they say something that makes me very suspicious as to what their real agenda is, I just go to my current book and look in the membership list, and yep, they're a member.
[00:47:01.044 --> 00:47:01.505]  No, I know.
[00:47:01.545 --> 00:47:02.385]  I appreciate the call.
[00:47:02.405 --> 00:47:06.267]  A couple years ago, I had a CFR member on.
[00:47:06.983 --> 00:47:12.069]  Who openly talked about government involvement in 9-11 and Bin Laden being protected and all that.
[00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:15.473]  And he got on air and talked about it all and admitted it.
[00:47:15.493 --> 00:47:18.656]  I mean, CFR is a broader base.
[00:47:18.716 --> 00:47:21.459]  It's 2,300 people and most of them are very, very bad.
[00:47:22.601 --> 00:47:24.403]  But some of them have been going public.
[00:47:24.803 --> 00:47:26.945]  And you could say, well, is that part of a dialectic?
[00:47:27.666 --> 00:47:28.107]  It may be.
[00:47:29.416 --> 00:47:32.518]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Maryland.
[00:47:32.558 --> 00:47:33.278]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:47:33.499 --> 00:47:36.020]  Hey, it's a pleasure to be on your program this morning.
[00:47:36.261 --> 00:47:37.201]  Pleasure to talk to you!
[00:47:37.602 --> 00:47:38.162]  Okay, thank you.
[00:47:39.123 --> 00:47:48.390]  I want to talk about the Social Security, maybe after, first off, but if you ask me, Bush's Social Security Scheme is a pig and a poke.
[00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:50.591]  I'll say it for a second, okay.
[00:47:50.751 --> 00:47:52.072]  Alright, alright.
[00:47:52.352 --> 00:47:56.996]  But no, listen, I mean, talk about Tony Blinkley and the person from the New Republic.
[00:47:57.748 --> 00:48:05.335]  Talking about executing people who disagree with the President, is this mindless rhetoric or is this their wildest fantasy come true?
[00:48:05.355 --> 00:48:15.904]  I mean, are these people serious that they would really be a part of executing people that disagree with the President?
[00:48:16.504 --> 00:48:17.585]  They're not joking.
[00:48:17.765 --> 00:48:22.229]  They're coming out of the woodwork, frothing, saying, kill, kill, kill.
[00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:25.172]  I've got, you know, Washington Times editorials, I've got
[00:48:26.037 --> 00:48:28.959]  New Republic Editorials, they're posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:48:29.299 --> 00:48:30.940]  Don't believe me, they're saying it.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:38.304]  Yeah, I believe you, and one thing I know about your show, no matter how outrageous the stuff is that you talk about, I mean, it's true.
[00:48:38.685 --> 00:48:41.006]  But I don't want you to believe me, I want you to go read it for yourself.
[00:48:41.166 --> 00:48:41.446]  Sure.
[00:48:41.947 --> 00:48:47.150]  Well, I mean, the whole Sosa Scurdy thing is, I mean, I don't trust either party.
[00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.811]  It's like, who do you want to be devoured by?
[00:48:50.231 --> 00:48:51.232]  Wolves or jackals?
[00:48:51.973 --> 00:48:54.414]  And it's like, the only reason, now I'm not a
[00:48:54.778 --> 00:48:55.999]  I got three and a half years of college.
[00:48:56.019 --> 00:48:57.059]  I'm a working class bloke.
[00:48:57.139 --> 00:49:05.664]  I don't have all the information readily at my fingertips of what's behind the scenes with Social Security.
[00:49:06.064 --> 00:49:12.348]  But to me, it just seems like the Democrats want to use Social Security as their own little petty cash.
[00:49:13.314 --> 00:49:14.935]  Yes, I think he's going to pull it off.
[00:49:35.413 --> 00:49:36.133]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:36.894 --> 00:49:37.574]  I appreciate it.
[00:49:37.974 --> 00:49:39.955]  Let's talk to Evan in Connecticut.
[00:49:40.015 --> 00:49:40.675]  Go ahead, Evan.
[00:49:41.175 --> 00:49:43.996]  Yeah, I'd like to explain about how Social Security works.
[00:49:44.476 --> 00:49:47.718]  I mean, a lot of these people have been saying, you know, the money's going to be there.
[00:49:48.298 --> 00:49:54.720]  Well, what happens is, the people pay the Social Security taxes that go into the Social Security Trust Fund.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:58.121]  And then the rest of the government comes along and says, hey, can I borrow that money?
[00:49:58.782 --> 00:50:02.083]  And then they lend the money out and the government leaves a little IOU.
[00:50:02.907 --> 00:50:05.568]  Yeah, I mean, all there are are receipts in there.
[00:50:05.828 --> 00:50:10.250]  Yeah, the Democrats say, well look, there's all these IOUs, we've got plenty of money to fund it, you know?
[00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:24.936]  But in reality, that's not... So the money will be there, but what happens when they're paying more in is they're going to have to either collect more taxes from us through the income tax or other taxes, or they're going to have to print more money, which causes inflation, which makes the benefits worse.
[00:50:24.976 --> 00:50:28.497]  What they do is they get you tied into a Ponzi scheme where you don't want to pull out.
[00:50:28.965 --> 00:50:29.145]  Yep.
[00:50:29.305 --> 00:50:36.251]  And then what happens when they privatize it is they're going to take all this money and they're going to say, well, you can put this in either stocks or bonds.
[00:50:36.671 --> 00:50:44.077]  You know, you can, you can give us the money either way and we're not going to give you anything after a while because inflation is going to take all of it anyway.
[00:50:45.218 --> 00:50:46.999]  Well, I couldn't say anything about it or anything else.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:49.321]  Uh, well, yeah, I did want to talk about it.
[00:50:49.341 --> 00:50:49.721]  Stay there.
[00:50:50.302 --> 00:50:51.162]  I'll give you some more time.
[00:50:51.202 --> 00:50:54.045]  Don't want to shortchange you up there in Connecticut.
[00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:56.827]  I'll come back and take more calls.
[00:50:57.547 --> 00:50:58.048]  Stay with us.

[00:53:50.048 --> 00:53:56.009]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:02.951 --> 00:54:11.693]  Alright, Evan, finish up what you were going to say, sir.
[00:54:11.913 --> 00:54:15.674]  Well, I wanted to say, the way that they take over the pension fund is
[00:54:16.573 --> 00:54:18.975]  And you've seen this with American Airlines already happen.
[00:54:18.995 --> 00:54:28.703]  When a company goes bankrupt, the government has an agency that takes the pension funds into receivership, and they pay out the benefits to the beneficiaries and stuff.
[00:54:29.183 --> 00:54:32.926]  That agency is paid for by your tax dollars.
[00:54:33.587 --> 00:54:37.088]  So, you know, all these companies just go bankrupt or whatever.
[00:54:37.148 --> 00:54:38.488]  And then we have all these pensioners.
[00:54:38.828 --> 00:54:49.290]  And by the way, what these companies do is years before they purposefully implode themselves, they take the real assets and put it into other dummy corporations and keep the scam going.
[00:54:49.730 --> 00:54:53.191]  Then the government takes it into receivership and starts paying out the pension funds.
[00:54:53.771 --> 00:54:58.252]  And then again, the Ponzi scheme, the bubble gets bigger and bigger, and it's nearing a popping point.
[00:54:58.512 --> 00:54:58.712]  Yep.
[00:54:58.772 --> 00:55:03.313]  And then to pay all this money, they have to print more money, which causes inflation.
[00:55:04.154 --> 00:55:07.776]  Net, what happens is you get the money, but it's not worth anything.
[00:55:07.816 --> 00:55:10.158]  You can't buy a bag of groceries for what you get in a month.
[00:55:10.198 --> 00:55:10.778]  Well, that's right.
[00:55:10.798 --> 00:55:12.980]  People keep saying the dollar's been devalued by 29%.
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:25.307]  Well, that's not the case, because the euro was trading at 89 cents to the dollar three years ago, and so it's gone to, you know, 129 or whatever, so you've got to add that other 11% onto there as well.
[00:55:27.988 --> 00:55:35.894]  But we had a huge devaluing of the currency, and it's a way to rob the people, and they've got the nerve to tell us there's no inflation!
[00:55:36.254 --> 00:55:37.815]  Yep, and they say 3.5% is low inflation.
[00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:47.834]  Whereas if you think about it, that means your income has to double every 20 years just to keep up with the rate of inflation.
[00:55:47.934 --> 00:55:55.698]  Well yeah, I mean 3%, 3.3% the average of the last few years compounded is big, but again, that's an index they use only on a few indicators.
[00:55:56.058 --> 00:56:01.601]  You look at real inflation, I mean look at fuel prices up 89 cents in the last year and a half.
[00:56:02.262 --> 00:56:04.263]  You look at just everything's going up in price.
[00:56:04.403 --> 00:56:06.424]  Well what happens is they manipulate the numbers
[00:56:07.014 --> 00:56:15.620]  For inflation, the two very interesting things, and your listeners can look this up, one is called Hadonic Pricing, the other one is called Geometric Pricing.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:16.341]  Exactly!
[00:56:16.861 --> 00:56:28.049]  And basically, Hadonic Pricing is saying, you know, a computer that's made now is 20 times more powerful than a computer, you know, five years ago, so the computer is actually worth 20 times more.
[00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:33.313]  So you sell a computer for $1,000 and they count it for inflation as you're selling a $20,000 computer.
[00:56:33.934 --> 00:56:35.415]  And then Geometric Pricing is
[00:56:35.816 --> 00:56:38.537]  They say if the price of something goes up, you're going to buy less.
[00:56:38.817 --> 00:56:40.457]  They'll say the price of eggs doubles.
[00:56:40.477 --> 00:56:45.178]  They're going to say, well, you know, they're only going to buy half as many eggs, so there's no inflation.
[00:56:46.618 --> 00:56:49.819]  Well, I mean, here's a transparent scam that's easy to understand.
[00:56:51.139 --> 00:56:52.679]  They say that unemployment's down.
[00:56:53.619 --> 00:56:57.680]  The feds don't count people who go off the unemployment rolls and just don't have jobs.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:56:59.961]  It's just not counted.
[00:57:00.541 --> 00:57:01.321]  No, they count.
[00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:04.841]  They've caught them counting somebody who has two, three jobs.
[00:57:05.101 --> 00:57:06.361]  They count each job.
[00:57:06.681 --> 00:57:12.423]  You know, let's say that there are, you know, 300 million jobs out there.
[00:57:12.743 --> 00:57:15.824]  Well, that's because a lot of people are working two, three jobs.
[00:57:15.964 --> 00:57:21.386]  So they count that as multiple individuals having jobs, when it's really one person having multiple jobs.
[00:57:21.426 --> 00:57:21.966]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:21.986 --> 00:57:26.108]  I mean, there's a bunch of different scams they run, and they're so transparent.
[00:57:26.728 --> 00:57:30.469]  I mean, a five-year-old could figure this out, but yuppies can't seem to understand it.
[00:57:31.336 --> 00:57:38.835]  They'll just have to find out for themselves before we end this hour and come back and take more calls and cover a bunch of other news in the second and third hour that's straight ahead.
[00:57:40.051 --> 00:57:42.012]  Just real fast here at the end of this hour.

[00:58:57.750 --> 00:58:58.330]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.036 --> 00:59:00.117]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.817 --> 00:59:01.898]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.558 --> 00:59:03.419]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.139 --> 00:59:05.020]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:09.363]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.903 --> 00:59:13.986]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.071 --> 00:59:37.618]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, now into our number two on this third day of February 2005, Thursday edition.
[00:59:37.698 --> 00:59:38.638]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:38.658 --> 00:59:46.104]  We're going to take a ton of your calls in this hour and get into the New Republic writer calls for Andy Bush left-wingers to be killed.
[00:59:46.585 --> 00:59:49.467]  This is on the heels of Tony Blakely saying similar things.
[00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.421]  It's very dangerous.
[00:59:51.962 --> 00:59:54.664]  Plus CIA trying to cover up their Nazi protection.
[00:59:55.445 --> 00:59:58.347]  Nazi agents brought into this country to set up our modern government.
[00:59:58.948 --> 01:00:00.229]  And much more coming up.
[01:00:00.269 --> 01:00:03.492]  We'll talk about Social Security and Lord Bush's speech last night.
[01:00:03.752 --> 01:00:05.894]  We also got into the faith-based initiative.
[01:00:05.914 --> 01:00:06.974]  Folks, do you know what that is?
[01:00:07.375 --> 01:00:08.616]  Federalizing the churches.
[01:00:08.656 --> 01:00:09.877]  Hillary's a big fan of it.
[01:00:10.778 --> 01:00:11.859]  She's a good conservative.
[01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.662]  Being a communist is basically being a conservative today.
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.600]  So I guess I'm not a very good conservative.
[01:00:19.201 --> 01:00:23.021]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.042]  Richard in New Mexico.
[01:00:25.082 --> 01:00:25.722]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:00:26.202 --> 01:00:27.022]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:28.743 --> 01:00:33.404]  He was talking about the voluntary Social Security private savings accounts.
[01:00:34.504 --> 01:00:38.605]  But wasn't the federal income tax initially voluntary?
[01:00:40.205 --> 01:00:40.945]  It certainly was.
[01:00:41.405 --> 01:00:42.245]  And the 16th Amendment
[01:00:46.463 --> 01:00:54.369]  Also was similarly involved in all of this, and this is what they're doing to us, and the age of taxation has just begun.
[01:00:54.389 --> 01:01:06.738]  They're just, they're twisting the linguistics, so, but, you know, I haven't heard anybody say anything about this, uh, making corporations not liable for, um, was it neglect?
[01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:10.741]  Well, two years ago,
[01:01:12.512 --> 01:01:17.976]  Bush came out with this initiative and then had the federal rules changed.
[01:01:17.996 --> 01:01:20.557]  I believe they call them cash balance accounts.
[01:01:20.897 --> 01:01:30.864]  And what they're saying is that corporations, they changed the rules where corporations own the pension fund and they pay you your pension at their pleasure.
[01:01:31.664 --> 01:01:37.428]  And so they changed the rules, cash balance accounts, so they could take your pension fund.
[01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:44.394]  And since then we've seen systematic looting begin, but they're just preparing for the full blow.
[01:01:44.414 --> 01:01:45.214]  Yeah.
[01:01:46.355 --> 01:01:54.899]  But I had a really vivid dream last night that gas had overnight jumped to $4.44 a gallon.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.120]  Extremely vivid dream.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:02.483]  And many of the stations were dismantled for what it's worth.
[01:02:03.243 --> 01:02:03.523]  Really?
[01:02:03.543 --> 01:02:04.804]  You had a dream where that happened?
[01:02:04.824 --> 01:02:06.245]  Well, I hope that dream doesn't come true.
[01:02:07.512 --> 01:02:08.533]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:02:08.573 --> 01:02:09.253]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:09.273 --> 01:02:13.476]  Yeah, they've been paying $5, $6, $7, $8, depending where you are in Europe.
[01:02:14.917 --> 01:02:20.261]  I mean, obviously converted under their currencies, but the equivalent of that for 10, 15 years.
[01:02:21.561 --> 01:02:23.743]  And now they're going to scam us here.
[01:02:23.783 --> 01:02:28.606]  We've got plenty of oil, but they're not going to let the people know that, I guess.
[01:02:29.567 --> 01:02:31.768]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:02:33.529 --> 01:02:35.351]  Let's talk to
[01:02:36.588 --> 01:02:39.129]  Leslie in Virginia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:02:39.149 --> 01:02:44.091]  Hi Alex, I just want to make a few brief comments on Social Security.
[01:02:44.671 --> 01:02:55.136]  It wasn't until 1965 that the Johnson Administration, during the Vietnam War, that Congress allowed Social Security funds to fund the general debt.
[01:02:56.016 --> 01:03:06.020]  And it wasn't until the late 1990s that it led to the so-called Republican Revolution demanding that they stop this obscene confiscation of funding the general debt with these funds.
[01:03:06.902 --> 01:03:13.806]  Well, this only, the general debt, was, uh, this practice only stopped for two years in the late 1990s.
[01:03:14.147 --> 01:03:15.788]  And then we go back to it again in 2000.
[01:03:16.868 --> 01:03:34.359]  Now, during Bush's inaugural speech, he was demanding that we have accountability in regards to the financial records, and I just strongly suggest that Congress just get their hands out of Social Security, for starters, because they have been using these funds to get re-elected term after term,
[01:03:34.992 --> 01:03:36.413]  Promoting their pet project.
[01:03:37.073 --> 01:03:41.135]  Now, Bush 134 and... Tell you what, you're making great points, Leslie.
[01:03:41.155 --> 01:03:41.676]  Just stay there.
[01:03:41.716 --> 01:03:43.877]  I'll come back to you and Don, Dave, and others.
[01:03:43.957 --> 01:03:44.958]  Call for your number to join us.
[01:03:44.978 --> 01:03:45.178]  800-259-9231.
[01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:46.138]  Website's prisonplanet.tv.

[01:03:54.019 --> 01:04:01.409]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.669 --> 01:04:06.415]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.655 --> 01:04:12.303]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.523 --> 01:04:17.066]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:24.432]  Attached was society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.452 --> 01:04:25.252]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:04:25.272 --> 01:04:28.955]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.155 --> 01:04:31.657]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[01:04:31.897 --> 01:04:38.282]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:04:38.302 --> 01:04:38.862]  We're good to go.
[01:04:53.163 --> 01:04:54.784]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:54.904 --> 01:04:59.007]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.147 --> 01:05:02.029]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.109 --> 01:05:08.834]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:09.014 --> 01:05:12.016]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.216 --> 01:05:14.618]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:14.738 --> 01:05:22.644]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:05:22.944 --> 01:05:23.964]  We're good to go.
[01:05:52.489 --> 01:05:56.692]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:05:57.452 --> 01:06:05.718]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:06:06.318 --> 01:06:08.039]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:14.744]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:06:15.364 --> 01:06:16.945]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:06:17.466 --> 01:06:19.607]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:06:20.197 --> 01:06:22.218]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:06:22.778 --> 01:06:23.878]  And it's so easy.
[01:06:24.599 --> 01:06:26.619]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:28.100]  When you want.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.240]  Where you want.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:35.082]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the verbal advantage they need for success.
[01:06:35.902 --> 01:06:38.743]  To learn more about verbal advantage, call now.
[01:06:38.763 --> 01:06:39.544]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:06:39.564 --> 01:06:40.004]  That's 419-WORD.
[01:06:40.024 --> 01:06:40.164]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:06:57.732 --> 01:06:58.392]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.032 --> 01:07:00.113]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.813 --> 01:07:01.934]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.554 --> 01:07:03.434]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.135 --> 01:07:05.035]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.715 --> 01:07:09.377]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.877 --> 01:07:14.039]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:19.062 --> 01:07:21.803]  When you speak well, you command respect.
[01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.064]  You move ahead faster.
[01:07:23.924 --> 01:07:25.505]  Try verbal advantage now.
[01:07:28.015 --> 01:07:34.377]  That ad was playing back during the break, and I was imitating it, and the fellow running the show said, Oh, I like that voice.
[01:07:34.397 --> 01:07:35.758]  I want to do the radio show in that voice.
[01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:41.860]  So, in the interest of humor, I'm now going to do the rest of the broadcast today in that voice.
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:51.603]  Just like Bush puts on a fake Texas accent, I will put it on a fake Atlantic accent, which is Bush's true accent, and I will talk like that.
[01:07:52.688 --> 01:07:55.929]  So now let us go back to Leslie in Virginia.
[01:07:56.469 --> 01:08:08.272]  Leslie, please complete what you were saying so eloquently about the Social Security Trust Fund and how the hellmail raiding of it began in 1965 by Lyndon Baines Johnson.
[01:08:08.932 --> 01:08:15.074]  Oh yes, we continued this practice for 40 years and Newt led the so-called Republican
[01:08:15.996 --> 01:08:16.716]  Revolution.
[01:08:17.237 --> 01:08:22.639]  And the platform was to get the Social Security to stop funding the general debt.
[01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:28.322]  But Congress, we only did this for approximately two years in the late 90s.
[01:08:29.302 --> 01:08:32.764]  I believe it was 98 and 99 where they stopped this obscene practice.
[01:08:33.244 --> 01:08:35.465]  And however, in 2000 we went back to it.
[01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:44.909]  But what is so interesting is that now President Bush gave his inaugural speech demanding accountability in regards to financial records
[01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:46.793]  Uh, it's very simple.
[01:08:46.953 --> 01:08:57.477]  It's just that, uh, we need to hold Congress accountable to get their hands out of Social Security, uh, because it's been funding their little pet projects to get re-elected term after term.
[01:08:58.178 --> 01:09:01.479]  And, uh, if you want reform, let's just start with the basics.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:07.602]  No, I hear you and I appreciate the call, but look, it's out of the frying pan into the oven.
[01:09:08.883 --> 01:09:11.744]  Because, you know, I don't trust these private companies either.
[01:09:11.784 --> 01:09:23.808]  They need to just stop the practice, stop Social Security, be honest about the fact, you know, pay out people above a certain age, and then, but again, they don't want to do that.
[01:09:23.848 --> 01:09:30.870]  They want you dependent on the government, and the government telling you, you will give us your money, and you will invest it where we say.
[01:09:32.050 --> 01:09:33.631]  All of this brings strings attached.
[01:09:33.671 --> 01:09:38.352]  It's like Bush comes out with faith-based initiative, and a lot of so-called conservatives go, great!
[01:09:38.965 --> 01:09:41.386]  It's time to get churches involved in our communities.
[01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:48.148]  Folks, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:09:48.648 --> 01:09:50.689]  The Bill of Rights starts with those words.
[01:09:51.649 --> 01:09:58.931]  Why do you think Chuckie Schumer and Hillary Clinton and Dick Gephardt are running around pushing the faith-based initiative now?
[01:09:59.251 --> 01:10:02.772]  I told you last year when they were saying they were against it, that was just rhetoric.
[01:10:03.152 --> 01:10:03.913]  They're for it.
[01:10:04.573 --> 01:10:08.634]  This is going to federalize the churches with upwards of nine million dollars a year to start.
[01:10:09.594 --> 01:10:12.039]  And Bush talked about that in his speech last night.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.204]  This will bring federal control into the churches.
[01:10:15.266 --> 01:10:20.858]  And if you take one dime of federal money, which, you know, your denomination takes it.
[01:10:21.514 --> 01:10:26.077]  And you are an official part of that denomination, then you'll be under those guidelines.
[01:10:26.117 --> 01:10:32.220]  And you'll have to hire people at your church that are from different religions, that have different tenets.
[01:10:32.360 --> 01:10:36.802]  And so this is now getting into private associations, private groups.
[01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:45.187]  And they're going to have the churches, quote, involved in all the social welfare net, you know, as basically bureaucrats.
[01:10:46.293 --> 01:10:51.675]  Uh, as CPS workers, uh, at every level of the social worker net.
[01:10:52.595 --> 01:10:53.875]  Following those guidelines.
[01:10:53.995 --> 01:10:54.535]  It's the same thing.
[01:10:54.555 --> 01:10:56.796]  People go, well, Alex, aren't you for school vouchers?
[01:10:57.456 --> 01:10:57.796]  No!
[01:10:58.536 --> 01:11:00.997]  I'm not for what the government's pushing.
[01:11:01.857 --> 01:11:07.479]  What the Republican Party's pushing is federal control over the private schools and home schools.
[01:11:08.354 --> 01:11:17.859]  And, uh, you know, saying, oh, well, you don't have to pay your taxes, or you pay us and we send you a voucher back, but now you're under our regulatory control.
[01:11:18.119 --> 01:11:19.800]  No, just if somebody's child...
[01:11:20.932 --> 01:11:28.535]  isn't in the public schools, and they want to send them somewhere else, they should not have to pay that percentage of the property tax that goes to the schools.
[01:11:29.195 --> 01:11:31.216]  And they go, but that'll hurt our public schools!
[01:11:31.716 --> 01:11:33.617]  The public schools are bloated.
[01:11:33.637 --> 01:11:34.737]  They have plenty of funding.
[01:11:34.977 --> 01:11:37.138]  They're designed to dumb the children down.
[01:11:37.438 --> 01:11:38.738]  Get your children out of them!
[01:11:39.459 --> 01:11:43.760]  Again, they get us tied into these government programs, and nothing good comes out of it.
[01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:45.801]  Oh, it's just incredible.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:49.481]  It's about getting us dependent.
[01:11:49.981 --> 01:11:50.441]  Oh, wait a minute.
[01:11:50.461 --> 01:11:52.302]  I got out of my Atlantic accent.
[01:11:53.522 --> 01:11:56.764]  See, I need to move to Kennebunkport, Maine and act like one of them.
[01:11:57.624 --> 01:12:00.085]  See, just like Bush came to Texas and acts like one of us.
[01:12:00.105 --> 01:12:03.206]  So let me get back into the real Bush dialect.
[01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:09.168]  Alright, let's now go ahead and speak to Don in Pennsylvania.
[01:12:09.228 --> 01:12:10.928]  Don, good to have you on with us today.
[01:12:10.948 --> 01:12:12.249]  Hi, Alex.
[01:12:12.509 --> 01:12:13.849]  That's a bad accent.
[01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.890]  That's too bad.
[01:12:16.449 --> 01:12:17.490]  I'm just curious.
[01:12:17.970 --> 01:12:20.391]  I got a thing here from Social Security on how to sign up.
[01:12:21.011 --> 01:12:25.253]  If you ever read one of their forms, which you can go to our local Social Security office.
[01:12:25.853 --> 01:12:27.394]  And remember, I didn't do this.
[01:12:27.854 --> 01:12:34.317]  If you read in there, they do not, and I repeat, do not accept a birth certificate as proof of who you are.
[01:12:34.337 --> 01:12:36.938]  They accept anything else but that.
[01:12:37.498 --> 01:12:41.080]  Now, the other thing is, as the other woman was saying,
[01:12:41.601 --> 01:12:44.583]  Social Security is now part of the national debt.
[01:12:44.704 --> 01:12:53.110]  So whenever we actually go bankrupt as a company, or as a country, you turn right around and you lose everything.
[01:12:53.551 --> 01:13:08.503]  And I personally haven't paid into the system for about ten darn years, and I ain't gonna brag, but I'm very not well off, but I could sustain quite a heck of a blow and still be happy.
[01:13:09.368 --> 01:13:10.709]  Well, they've done the math.
[01:13:10.789 --> 01:13:23.857]  If somebody took, say, 5% of their monthly income, put it into an account yielding 5% in a conservative fund, over 30 years, you're going to have, just with an average income, millions of dollars.
[01:13:24.537 --> 01:13:26.939]  Instead, with Social Security, you get a pittance.
[01:13:27.739 --> 01:13:37.385]  Well, the Social Security, I called them up here, and they said, well, I'm ineligible to receive it, so I don't want it.
[01:13:37.725 --> 01:13:38.626]  But our problem is,
[01:13:39.028 --> 01:13:42.090]  Now you go to an employer that says, well, you have to have it.
[01:13:42.550 --> 01:13:43.211]  No, you don't.
[01:13:43.231 --> 01:13:48.754]  Imagine if the founding fathers saw a country where the government pays people a check.
[01:13:50.295 --> 01:13:51.396]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:13:51.856 --> 01:14:05.585]  Well, you know, the thing is, no one has ever heard, and I don't know if I could ever find a ruling, and maybe you could help me here, or maybe not, but there was a ruling on a guy who sued Wendy's, got a half a million dollars because he didn't have a number.
[01:14:06.958 --> 01:14:12.704]  I know that it happened about four years ago, but I'll be darned if I can find her, or is that Thursday, if you will.
[01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:13.024]  What?
[01:14:13.104 --> 01:14:16.208]  I mean, you're saying that because they didn't give him a social security number?
[01:14:17.389 --> 01:14:18.730]  Or because they took withholding?
[01:14:19.251 --> 01:14:23.415]  You went up to Wendy's and Wendy's said, well, because you don't have a social security number.
[01:14:23.928 --> 01:14:26.370]  That is still legal and we're going to fire you.
[01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:27.251]  Oh, exactly!
[01:14:27.291 --> 01:14:31.514]  No, it's the 1986 Privacy Act, which is not enforced.
[01:14:31.935 --> 01:14:34.477]  It's illegal for them to demand that, but everybody does it.
[01:14:34.497 --> 01:14:35.077]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:35.097 --> 01:14:35.617]  Alright.
[01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:49.769]  In fact, from 86 until the late 90s, all Social Security cards said not to be used as a personal identification number, only for the administration of your Social Security account.
[01:14:50.635 --> 01:14:52.576]  That's paraphrasing, but pull it out of your wallet.
[01:14:52.596 --> 01:14:53.056]  It'll say that.
[01:14:53.437 --> 01:14:54.637]  It doesn't say that anymore.
[01:14:55.478 --> 01:15:02.901]  Of course, they promised everybody before that when they gave us Social Security, oh, this will never be used as a personal ID number.
[01:15:03.702 --> 01:15:07.004]  Let's go ahead now and take another call here.
[01:15:07.204 --> 01:15:09.225]  Dave in Illinois.
[01:15:09.285 --> 01:15:10.065]  Dave, you're on the air.
[01:15:10.105 --> 01:15:10.485]  Go ahead.
[01:15:10.505 --> 01:15:12.787]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:13.127 --> 01:15:15.348]  I guess I'm going to get a little bit off the subject here.
[01:15:15.408 --> 01:15:17.209]  Hey, whatever subject you want to talk about.
[01:15:17.765 --> 01:15:20.989]  Well, the good old FDA, you know, their rigid standards.
[01:15:21.310 --> 01:15:25.195]  They just approved the good old vagus nerve stimulator for depression.
[01:15:26.236 --> 01:15:27.818]  So we can all be happy now.
[01:15:28.379 --> 01:15:32.425]  Oh, they just approved the microchip system into your brain through your nerves?
[01:15:33.007 --> 01:15:36.168]  Yeah, and it hooks up to your neck and goes right to your brain.
[01:15:36.188 --> 01:15:37.089]  Well, that's freedom.
[01:15:37.309 --> 01:15:42.291]  And again, the government has already ordered hundreds of thousands of people and children on drugs.
[01:15:42.911 --> 01:15:44.472]  And under New Freedom, they're going to do it even more.
[01:15:44.512 --> 01:15:47.994]  And so I guess they'll order a vagus nerve stimulator into your brain.
[01:15:48.454 --> 01:15:50.375]  And I've got the articles all over the country.
[01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:54.797]  State troopers are now jamming needles into people on the side of the road to check for drugs.
[01:15:55.737 --> 01:15:56.978]  It is going to be fun.
[01:15:57.038 --> 01:15:59.999]  Another Texas company going crazy.
[01:16:01.233 --> 01:16:06.697]  Yeah, they're improving all sorts of goodies, and hey, we ordered you to take the chip.
[01:16:06.797 --> 01:16:07.798]  What's wrong with that?
[01:16:08.478 --> 01:16:10.040]  Yep, good old implant.
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.260]  Well, that's all I got.
[01:16:11.301 --> 01:16:11.921]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:12.762]  Thank you.
[01:16:12.842 --> 01:16:14.743]  Sounds like freedom to me.
[01:16:15.924 --> 01:16:18.105]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roy in Michigan.
[01:16:18.165 --> 01:16:19.066]  Roy, go ahead, sir.
[01:16:19.847 --> 01:16:25.110]  Yeah, the other day, the Joyce Riley Show, she was saying that
[01:16:26.431 --> 01:16:50.601]  that there was a directive that came from the Homeland Security from Tommy Thompson before he left office that put us into a state of emergency and that using that state of emergency he is ordering the inoculation of Amtrak vaccination to those between the ages of 18 and 65.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:59.590]  No, I've tried my heck to try to verify that, and I thought maybe something of that magnitude you may have heard.
[01:17:00.749 --> 01:17:06.632]  No, I hadn't heard that, but a lot of times, different federal agencies declare emergencies continually.
[01:17:07.112 --> 01:17:24.141]  Every year, I even saw once live on C-SPAN, a message from the President, and then they go, we are declaring another emergency for the next year, and that way they can claim they can get around the Constitution, because they're all a bunch of lawyers, and they're sticklers for what they do, and I know one of the model states called the Emergency Powers Act,
[01:17:25.112 --> 01:17:35.902]  Uh, passed federally because they couldn't get the states, all the states to pass it, so they put it in page 76 of the Homeland Security Bill two and a half years ago when it passed and that new department got funding.
[01:17:36.883 --> 01:17:42.008]  Now to have Michael Chertoff heading it up, uh, that, that forced inoculation has been passed.
[01:17:42.588 --> 01:17:44.990]  Again, it doesn't mean it's lawful or legal or you have to follow it.
[01:17:46.115 --> 01:17:48.878]  You know, if the government passed a law, we'd all have to slit our throats.
[01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:51.140]  You know, it's a bogus law, folks.
[01:17:52.061 --> 01:17:54.123]  But that is certainly there.
[01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:59.628]  And the executive orders, you know, for some reason they keep re-issuing executive orders every few years.
[01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:06.414]  They had executive orders about taking all your property, taking your kids, putting you in FEMA camps, using you for slave labor in the 60s.
[01:18:06.855 --> 01:18:09.157]  And they re-issue them in the 70s, and the 80s, and the 90s, and in the 2000s.
[01:18:10.959 --> 01:18:14.462]  So they just keep re-issuing the same stuff over and over again.
[01:18:14.502 --> 01:18:16.183]  So, yeah, I'm familiar with stuff like that.
[01:18:16.703 --> 01:18:19.525]  I don't know about some new issuance of it, but I don't doubt it.
[01:18:19.966 --> 01:18:30.333]  I don't, but if it is true that there's one way that you could change Biden to be a fascist, and that is letting him go, he's threatened with his own fascism.
[01:18:30.493 --> 01:18:34.977]  But this whole thing is all being brought about by the religious people.
[01:18:34.997 --> 01:18:39.160]  If you have that caught on, it's the religious republic, the Democrats,
[01:18:39.872 --> 01:18:40.132]  Stay there!
[01:18:53.294 --> 01:18:59.177]  Hey, I'll tell ya, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[01:18:59.237 --> 01:19:00.937]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigor.
[01:19:01.178 --> 01:19:03.058]  Hey, last weekend, I helped my neighbor move.
[01:19:03.339 --> 01:19:05.099]  It took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:09.161]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[01:19:09.221 --> 01:19:12.503]  And then after that, I went ahead and did my 20 minutes of cardio.
[01:19:12.623 --> 01:19:12.683]  Wow!
[01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:17.621]  My wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[01:19:17.921 --> 01:19:18.501]  Well, that's great.
[01:19:18.561 --> 01:19:21.362]  And just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in Collagenate.
[01:19:21.422 --> 01:19:21.642]  Right.
[01:19:21.662 --> 01:19:23.483]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants.
[01:19:23.663 --> 01:19:26.544]  It's more that because you've lost weight, you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[01:19:26.764 --> 01:19:27.164]  Absolutely.
[01:19:27.204 --> 01:19:28.044]  I'm sleeping better.
[01:19:28.325 --> 01:19:29.525]  I feel better during the day.
[01:19:29.545 --> 01:19:31.226]  I don't get as tired in the afternoons.
[01:19:31.386 --> 01:19:32.626]  And I'm able to do a lot more.
[01:19:32.766 --> 01:19:33.807]  Collagenate is safe.
[01:19:33.967 --> 01:19:34.607]  It's natural.
[01:19:34.707 --> 01:19:35.227]  It's healthy.
[01:19:35.347 --> 01:19:37.448]  And it's helped me to lose over 40 pounds now.
[01:19:37.608 --> 01:19:39.590]  Call and order Vim and Vigorous Collagenate 1-800-6222-FEN.

[01:20:04.042 --> 01:20:04.902]  November 2003 to November 2004.

[01:20:05.583 --> 01:20:05.983]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:06.003 --> 01:20:08.964]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:20:08.984 --> 01:20:11.225]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:22.873 --> 01:20:25.215]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:20:25.235 --> 01:20:28.498]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:29.118 --> 01:20:32.161]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:21:05.337 --> 01:21:09.439]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:21:09.879 --> 01:21:18.563]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.

[01:23:02.503 --> 01:23:12.741]  Well, more and more so-called Republican leaders are saying they want to kill, machine gun, execute, enslave, put in forced labor camps anyone that disagrees with the government.
[01:23:14.801 --> 01:23:20.084]  I mean, every week now, another neocon leader comes out and says, these people are trying to warp our minds.
[01:23:20.124 --> 01:23:20.704]  That's coming up.
[01:23:20.724 --> 01:23:21.404]  A bunch of other news.
[01:23:21.685 --> 01:23:26.447]  Continuing with your calls, I want to go quickly to these calls, because I want to get everybody in, give everybody a chance to talk.
[01:23:26.527 --> 01:23:34.211]  Just real fast, Roy, in a nutshell, what you're saying about these, quote, religious groups helping bring all this along.
[01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:40.794]  Well, it's obvious that it's religious Republicans, Democrats, Pentecostals, and if you name it, religious.
[01:23:40.934 --> 01:23:42.275]  But this is what Christ said.
[01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:46.306]  He said, you have to commit that if you do these two, you have done them all.
[01:23:46.926 --> 01:23:49.567]  That is to love God above all, and to love your neighbor.
[01:23:50.088 --> 01:23:51.709]  That's everyone, including your enemy.
[01:23:51.949 --> 01:23:54.670]  Love your enemy more than those that love you.
[01:23:55.310 --> 01:24:00.813]  And then we have to do what those religious guys could never do, and that's stand before God uncondemned.
[01:24:01.434 --> 01:24:05.116]  Because every time we condemn ourselves or anyone else, we're calling Christ a liar.
[01:24:05.136 --> 01:24:07.437]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:24:07.517 --> 01:24:08.697]  I appreciate it, Roy.
[01:24:11.437 --> 01:24:14.718]  I mean, I wouldn't say the religious are the problem in America.
[01:24:14.738 --> 01:24:23.962]  I would say the problem is people being ill-informed and, you know, not having any idea what America's all about and being dumbed down.
[01:24:25.082 --> 01:24:31.404]  And certainly a lot of these so-called Christians out there aren't Christians at all and, you know, think George Bush is this great Christian.
[01:24:31.424 --> 01:24:35.386]  I mean, it's mainly a bunch of gullible people who just want to think everything's okay.
[01:24:36.753 --> 01:24:45.517]  And man, America's number one, and we're in the right, and we haven't done anything wrong, and it's like a phony, a phony patriotism.
[01:24:45.557 --> 01:24:55.301]  I mean, Schwarzenegger in his State of the Union speech, or in his convention speech, State of the Union speech is coming up for him, I'm sure, you know, said, I wrap myself in the American flag.
[01:24:55.361 --> 01:24:57.682]  I physically wrap it around me in these images.
[01:24:57.722 --> 01:24:58.763]  It just lies!
[01:24:59.843 --> 01:25:05.446]  I mean, it's just sappy, you know, lowest common denominator propaganda.
[01:25:06.241 --> 01:25:07.101]  And that's what they do.
[01:25:07.121 --> 01:25:13.443]  I mean, they got top psychologists, top experts, writing these speeches, and people just sit there going, boy, that was a good line.
[01:25:13.463 --> 01:25:15.484]  Man, these people are great speakers.
[01:25:17.165 --> 01:25:18.325]  It's all crafted.
[01:25:18.365 --> 01:25:20.846]  You've got corrupt, out-of-control people running things.
[01:25:21.286 --> 01:25:23.467]  We're losing our freedoms, and we better wake up to it.
[01:25:23.507 --> 01:25:24.667]  I mean, that's what's really happening.
[01:25:25.737 --> 01:25:28.679]  But no, the establishment says everything's fine, go back to sleep.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:30.421]  Well, we can't do that.
[01:25:30.801 --> 01:25:31.702]  John in Tennessee.
[01:25:31.782 --> 01:25:32.522]  John, go ahead.
[01:25:33.083 --> 01:25:33.483]  Hello, Alex.
[01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:34.123]  How are you doing?
[01:25:34.444 --> 01:25:34.924]  Happy New Year.
[01:25:34.944 --> 01:25:37.106]  It's the first time I called in since the New Year.
[01:25:38.807 --> 01:25:43.130]  The last thing I'd like to talk about, but I know the time is short, so I'll just hit on one thing really quick.
[01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:47.593]  Have you heard of this group called the Mujahideen Al-Khaliq?
[01:25:48.014 --> 01:25:49.855]  It's Colin Powell,
[01:25:53.427 --> 01:26:00.711]  gave a verification of the quote-unquote verification of their intelligence about Iran and we have our special forces are working with them right now in Iran.
[01:26:00.731 --> 01:26:02.092]  Have you heard of that group?
[01:26:02.112 --> 01:26:12.097]  Well, yeah, there's paid-off groups that work for the State Department, the Pentagon, and the CIA telling them whatever intelligence they want on weapons of mass destruction in Iran.
[01:26:12.117 --> 01:26:12.418]  Right.
[01:26:12.818 --> 01:26:13.698]  I looked up this group.
[01:26:14.219 --> 01:26:17.080]  I found something at the Council of Foreign Relations website.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.641]  This group was formed in the 1970s.
[01:26:19.662 --> 01:26:22.163]  They're a Marxist-Islamic group.
[01:26:23.697 --> 01:26:27.165]  They have been implicated in the 1970s for killing U.S.
[01:26:27.205 --> 01:26:28.728]  military personnel and civilians.
[01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:30.873]  Yeah, I'm familiar with the group.
[01:26:30.913 --> 01:26:31.855]  I'm glad you raised this.
[01:26:34.013 --> 01:26:38.114]  They'll go hire any group of criminals to then just say whatever they want on paper.
[01:26:38.694 --> 01:26:43.376]  Oh, Niger's giving uranium to Saddam, you know, aluminum tubes.
[01:26:43.676 --> 01:26:46.056]  Why, we know right where the weapons of mass destruction are.
[01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:47.297]  They're right here in Tikrit.
[01:26:47.657 --> 01:26:49.477]  It's just more lies for old.
[01:26:49.597 --> 01:26:52.658]  Yeah, this is supposed to be a war on terrorism, not a war with terrorists.
[01:26:52.958 --> 01:26:54.158]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:26:54.379 --> 01:27:00.680]  And something else... Well, I mean, sir, the Republicans' own Senate report in 1999 admits Al-Qaeda was used to attack the Serbs.
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:01.480]  Yeah.
[01:27:01.741 --> 01:27:03.061]  I mean, they work for the globalists.
[01:27:03.795 --> 01:27:04.075]  Right.
[01:27:04.115 --> 01:27:11.638]  And something else in the same paper was saying that President Bush actually signed a treaty with this organization.
[01:27:11.738 --> 01:27:16.180]  It's the first time any president has signed a treaty with a terrorist organization.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.341]  Yeah, he recognizes them.
[01:27:17.381 --> 01:27:18.001]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:18.061 --> 01:27:18.761]  Really good points.
[01:27:18.802 --> 01:27:19.862]  Glad you called.
[01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:26.165]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next?
[01:27:27.165 --> 01:27:28.206]  Suzette in Texas.
[01:27:28.246 --> 01:27:29.046]  Go ahead, Suzette.
[01:27:29.582 --> 01:27:31.523]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:27:31.784 --> 01:27:38.968]  Back to the Social Security, I wanted to tell you about a pamphlet I read from LaRouche, Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:27:39.329 --> 01:27:39.829]  LaRouche.
[01:27:40.069 --> 01:27:40.830]  LaRouche, okay.
[01:27:40.890 --> 01:27:42.371]  I'm not real familiar with him.
[01:27:43.157 --> 01:27:44.498]  But it was very interesting.
[01:27:44.518 --> 01:27:52.201]  He says that George Shultz is trying to model this after Pinochet's pension plan in Chile.
[01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:52.961]  Oh, they admit.
[01:27:52.981 --> 01:27:54.201]  Yeah, it's the Chilean plan.
[01:27:54.502 --> 01:27:57.923]  Yeah, and basically our employers will not be paying anything.
[01:27:58.023 --> 01:27:59.524]  We'll be paying all of it.
[01:27:59.564 --> 01:28:01.084]  It will still be mandatory.
[01:28:01.784 --> 01:28:06.186]  And there'll be like four different companies that we can invest with.
[01:28:06.246 --> 01:28:09.007]  And they're big people like Citibank and... No, no.
[01:28:09.027 --> 01:28:10.288]  See, this is what's happening.
[01:28:10.308 --> 01:28:10.648]  Criminal.
[01:28:11.627 --> 01:28:17.351]  The global corporations of the top 100 economies, 44 of them are corporations.
[01:28:18.051 --> 01:28:22.594]  And they're bigger than governments, so now they're just taking over what the government does, but it's not free market.
[01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:25.035]  It's an oligopoly or a quasi-monopoly.
[01:28:25.256 --> 01:28:26.416]  Right, but they're selling it.
[01:28:26.456 --> 01:28:27.937]  Stay there, you're absolutely on target.
[01:28:28.618 --> 01:28:31.319]  You're absolutely just over the target.
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:33.821]  Nail on the head, all of that.
[01:28:34.761 --> 01:28:36.663]  And yeah, Pinochet, he's a nice person.
[01:28:38.016 --> 01:28:40.980]  They've been telling us for a decade how great his economic plan is.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:41.581]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.663 --> 01:28:44.565]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.045 --> 01:28:46.667]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.568 --> 01:28:50.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.256 --> 01:29:00.541]  Hi, this is Tasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pep back in your step.
[01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:05.725]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[01:29:05.945 --> 01:29:19.215]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:22.698]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:25.319]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.
[01:29:25.499 --> 01:29:29.340]  It's safe, non-evasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:32.621]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and Little League alike.
[01:29:32.842 --> 01:29:36.343]  The LifeWave patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[01:29:36.623 --> 01:29:40.704]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition, or just trying to beat the clock.
[01:29:41.004 --> 01:29:43.225]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[01:29:43.425 --> 01:29:46.766]  Go to www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[01:29:47.027 --> 01:29:50.508]  Again, that's www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[01:29:53.317 --> 01:29:56.338]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:56.658 --> 01:30:01.581]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.841 --> 01:30:06.202]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.483 --> 01:30:15.406]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.606 --> 01:30:19.228]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.508 --> 01:30:24.558]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.859 --> 01:30:31.552]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.054 --> 01:30:32.695]  What about you?
[01:30:33.355 --> 01:30:38.720]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:53.679 --> 01:30:56.841]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[01:30:57.042 --> 01:30:59.743]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[01:30:59.924 --> 01:31:01.325]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[01:31:01.485 --> 01:31:11.412]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning the compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[01:31:11.632 --> 01:31:13.353]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[01:31:13.633 --> 01:31:17.496]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[01:31:17.736 --> 01:31:22.159]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:31:22.359 --> 01:31:26.202]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[01:31:26.442 --> 01:31:32.627]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:31:32.827 --> 01:31:34.388]  No more mess, no more odors,
[01:31:34.708 --> 01:31:35.649]  No more hard work.
[01:31:35.789 --> 01:31:39.130]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:43.093]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on a compost twin.
[01:31:43.213 --> 01:31:44.433]  Call toll free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:31:44.593 --> 01:31:45.014]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:32:01.358 --> 01:32:04.140]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central during the day.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:06.602]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:32:06.922 --> 01:32:08.203]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:32:08.783 --> 01:32:11.485]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:32:11.865 --> 01:32:21.492]  Suzette in Texas was talking about how it's the Pinochet model being modeled and pushed by George Shultz, top globalist.
[01:32:21.572 --> 01:32:22.973]  I call him Super Gopher.
[01:32:23.013 --> 01:32:25.955]  He works directly for the elite families.
[01:32:27.253 --> 01:32:30.255]  He's always behind, well he's behind getting George Bush into office.
[01:32:30.295 --> 01:32:31.275]  He's behind Arnold.
[01:32:31.295 --> 01:32:36.478]  He literally lives there at the Capitol most of the time.
[01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:39.000]  Literally staying at the Capitol in Sacramento.
[01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:41.661]  Sneaking around, pushing all this.
[01:32:42.202 --> 01:32:44.083]  And so yeah, what they do is they let the government loot it.
[01:32:44.103 --> 01:32:45.684]  Now they're going to let the corporations loot it.
[01:32:47.205 --> 01:32:49.426]  And this is not a choice at all.
[01:32:50.266 --> 01:32:54.769]  And I think they're going to give us like three different choices of different forms of investment.
[01:32:55.470 --> 01:33:06.361]  And then have licensed holding companies that that has to go through that then license which mutual fund is allowed to be purchased by you.
[01:33:06.821 --> 01:33:12.747]  So you'll be given kind of a menu of it, which then gets the government into control of investing to a greater degree.
[01:33:16.465 --> 01:33:17.265]  You were bringing this up.
[01:33:17.285 --> 01:33:18.146]  You had some more comments?
[01:33:18.806 --> 01:33:19.706]  Oh, not really.
[01:33:19.766 --> 01:33:22.967]  I just wanted everybody to know that it's not really going to be private.
[01:33:23.167 --> 01:33:24.388]  You're not going to have any control.
[01:33:24.468 --> 01:33:26.629]  You know, really the solution is just to get rid of it.
[01:33:27.269 --> 01:33:31.791]  Except for, you know, then we have all these people that have paid into it for years and do deserve something.
[01:33:32.591 --> 01:33:34.391]  But anyway, that's all I wanted to say.
[01:33:34.411 --> 01:33:34.592]  Thank you.
[01:33:34.812 --> 01:33:35.712]  Good to hear from you.
[01:33:36.212 --> 01:33:41.254]  I mean, look, they can right now just cut Social Security off at a certain age.
[01:33:41.674 --> 01:33:44.115]  They're already raising the age of it when you get it.
[01:33:45.374 --> 01:33:51.379]  And they admit it's going to be bankrupt, but if they stop it now and just tell people to keep their own money.
[01:33:51.399 --> 01:33:52.800]  But that's not going to happen, folks.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:53.961]  Don't worry.
[01:33:54.742 --> 01:33:57.924]  You can all feel good and think you're conservative and go along with the plan.
[01:33:58.545 --> 01:34:02.188]  And then a few decades down the road, you'll remember that you were ripped off.
[01:34:03.409 --> 01:34:06.592]  It's just going from bad to worse is what's happening.
[01:34:07.313 --> 01:34:09.074]  I mean, what do you expect with these crooks?
[01:34:09.154 --> 01:34:11.436]  Of course they were going to raid the Social Security Trust Fund.
[01:34:11.716 --> 01:34:12.417]  And they've done it.
[01:34:13.571 --> 01:34:15.132]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[01:34:15.172 --> 01:34:15.893]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:34:16.213 --> 01:34:16.894]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:34:17.174 --> 01:34:17.494]  Hello.
[01:34:17.674 --> 01:34:25.900]  Sorry to be on such a Tavistock kick lately, but tonight I'm going to attend a lecture by a man named Neil Gershenfeld.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.560]  Have you heard of him?
[01:34:27.721 --> 01:34:28.181]  Vaguely.
[01:34:28.821 --> 01:34:31.743]  He's the director of MIT's Center for Bits and Atoms.
[01:34:32.184 --> 01:34:33.805]  And guess what the name of his thing is?
[01:34:34.345 --> 01:34:35.606]  Fabricating the Future.
[01:34:35.686 --> 01:34:39.048]  Talking about combining the digital world with the physical world.
[01:34:40.689 --> 01:34:43.031]  And MIT is totally connected.
[01:34:43.570 --> 01:35:02.596]  Well, yeah, and they developed the face scanning cameras, the license plate scanning systems, the whole control grid, and the meshing of society into this cashless society system, and they're also involved in perfecting propaganda.
[01:35:02.857 --> 01:35:03.577]  I was aware of that.
[01:35:03.637 --> 01:35:04.837]  Yeah, MIT, something else.
[01:35:05.257 --> 01:35:07.118]  MIT invented the RFID chip.
[01:35:07.538 --> 01:35:16.642]  It's going to be interesting to see, you know, all the cryptic little clues that might be in his speech as I'm going tonight.
[01:35:16.662 --> 01:35:17.322]  I look forward to it.
[01:35:17.342 --> 01:35:27.406]  And yesterday you were talking, too, about something where that Roosevelt, didn't that, where they turned over the sovereignty to England for court purposes?
[01:35:28.746 --> 01:35:30.447]  Must have been listening to a different show.
[01:35:30.907 --> 01:35:32.268]  Oh, no, no, that was you with Dr. Cuddy.
[01:35:32.848 --> 01:35:33.708]  And you mentioned that, like, in 1947
[01:35:35.854 --> 01:35:40.997]  We were talking about when all the Tavistock... Oh, I'm sorry, we don't have... But yeah, but the MIT... Thank you for the call.
[01:35:42.678 --> 01:35:54.965]  What we were talking about was how England, the Tavistock Institute, did mesh with and advise different federal departments on psychology and propaganda.
[01:35:54.985 --> 01:35:58.147]  I just misunderstood what you were saying.
[01:35:58.807 --> 01:36:02.369]  Let's go ahead and talk to Randy in Florida.
[01:36:02.429 --> 01:36:03.190]  Randy, go ahead.
[01:36:04.284 --> 01:36:12.068]  Well, I guess, you know, after hearing the speech last night, I mean, happy days are here again, and I'm not talking about the TV reunion show tonight, you know.
[01:36:12.108 --> 01:36:20.952]  I mean, everything was just like rosy in America, you know, and all the die-hard Republicans ate it up through their rose-colored glasses, I'm sure.
[01:36:20.972 --> 01:36:23.814]  You know, and we're glowing and gushing over every word.
[01:36:26.815 --> 01:36:27.976]  That's what happened, yeah.
[01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:30.357]  Yeah, it just turned my stomach.
[01:36:32.098 --> 01:36:33.018]  Alright, anything else?
[01:36:34.352 --> 01:36:52.546]  You know, I mean, you know, the colonial slogan in the revolution was, resistance to tyranny is obedience to God, you know, and it's not just awareness of what they're doing, it's resistance to it, you know, and a lot of people are aware of what's going on and awake about it, but they're not resisting it.
[01:36:52.746 --> 01:37:03.475]  As the Founding Fathers showed us by example, you know, we're going along with a lot of things that we shouldn't, you know, and that's where we separate ourselves from them, you know,
[01:37:04.335 --> 01:37:08.357]  We sit there and pay lip service to them, but we don't follow their example, you know?
[01:37:08.838 --> 01:37:12.860]  We should just stop going along with and obeying a lot of this stuff.
[01:37:12.900 --> 01:37:15.502]  Let's stop sending in our income tax, you know?
[01:37:16.002 --> 01:37:18.924]  They didn't pay all those taxes that the British Crown put on them.
[01:37:19.824 --> 01:37:20.264]  I hear you.
[01:37:20.285 --> 01:37:21.345]  I appreciate the call.
[01:37:21.405 --> 01:37:21.925]  Take care.
[01:37:21.945 --> 01:37:23.526]  I'm going to take one more call.
[01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:25.348]  I'm going to get into news for the balance of the hour.
[01:37:25.368 --> 01:37:27.669]  Then I'll come back in the next hour, continue with your phone calls.
[01:37:28.069 --> 01:37:32.712]  We'll talk to Keith here in a second, but that's an interesting point that he raises.
[01:37:33.983 --> 01:37:42.931]  I mean, I've used the example of if the government passed a law that we all have to report to crematoriums, we have a right and a duty to resist it.
[01:37:43.611 --> 01:37:54.602]  If the government passes a law that we have to throw our children off cliffs, you know, once a year like the Aztecs did, I mean, we don't have to follow it.
[01:37:56.523 --> 01:37:57.104]  If the government
[01:37:57.938 --> 01:38:04.563]  You know, my overused example comes back and the Supreme Court says black people aren't human beings, as they've said before, and we don't have to follow that.
[01:38:04.624 --> 01:38:05.484]  It's just not true.
[01:38:06.885 --> 01:38:16.273]  And so the Supreme Court can say there's no Fourth Amendment, no probable cause needed to set up checkpoints with drug dogs, or no Fourth Amendment needed for them to take your blood on the side of the road.
[01:38:17.214 --> 01:38:18.275]  We have to resist that.
[01:38:18.315 --> 01:38:19.816]  That's totally unconstitutional.
[01:38:19.856 --> 01:38:20.396]  It's a fraud.
[01:38:20.857 --> 01:38:22.318]  The question is, how do we resist it?
[01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.849]  Do we educate?
[01:38:23.869 --> 01:38:25.409]  Do we get state laws passed?
[01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:29.550]  Do we sue public officials, officials, authorities?
[01:38:31.671 --> 01:38:32.771]  How do we handle this?
[01:38:33.211 --> 01:38:39.532]  I mean, we've slid so far into tyranny that it's hard for people to even recognize it when it's looking them in the eyes.
[01:38:41.253 --> 01:38:41.953]  So, you're right.
[01:38:41.993 --> 01:38:42.893]  I mean, we're in deep trouble.
[01:38:43.433 --> 01:38:47.654]  And we've gotten into this mode of just submitting to whatever, you know, new thing comes down the road.
[01:38:49.074 --> 01:38:51.475]  As they implement the new Freedom Initiative in ten states,
[01:38:52.291 --> 01:38:53.101]  That's going to go into all 50.
[01:38:55.011 --> 01:38:58.974]  Forced psychological testing of every child in America, even of your homeschool or public school?
[01:38:59.014 --> 01:39:19.549]  I mean, are you really going to just let them take your children and let a psychologist paid for with federal money, with a handbook written by Eli Lilly, then assess that your child's mentally ill and then prescribe the drugs on the spot and threaten to take them if you don't put them on drugs and their own documents that brag that it's all about money and that they're going to put half the kids on?
[01:39:19.589 --> 01:39:22.191]  I mean, half of you out there, if they're able to implement this,
[01:39:22.631 --> 01:39:24.012]  Are you going to have your children on drugs?
[01:39:24.032 --> 01:39:25.593]  Are you just going to go quietly into the night?
[01:39:25.613 --> 01:39:28.515]  I mean, imagine reading a history book.
[01:39:29.736 --> 01:39:32.618]  Hitler made half the Germans take drugs.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:36.181]  You'd go, man, that was tyranny!
[01:39:36.481 --> 01:39:44.547]  But here in America, it's just, well, you know, I mean... And see, Bush is good, and Bill Clinton, all of them are good at getting up there and making you feel like you're part of something.
[01:39:44.567 --> 01:39:50.651]  And, oh, you know, you're part of the system, and everything's great, and we're with you, and we're all one big happy family.
[01:39:51.531 --> 01:40:01.196]  It's just sick psychology, but a lot of weak-minded people want to believe that everything's okay, want to just think they're part of the system, reflected glory, and want to deny all this.
[01:40:01.556 --> 01:40:03.197]  And so, okay, just keep denying it.
[01:40:04.257 --> 01:40:06.978]  Keep denying that national ID cards are now being put into place.
[01:40:07.299 --> 01:40:09.800]  Keep denying that all this is happening.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:13.362]  I mean, it's just so sad to watch this happen.
[01:40:13.462 --> 01:40:14.562]  Keith in Louisiana.
[01:40:14.582 --> 01:40:15.202]  Keith, go ahead.
[01:40:15.663 --> 01:40:15.883]  Yeah.
[01:40:16.223 --> 01:40:17.023]  How are you doing today, Alex?
[01:40:17.123 --> 01:40:17.604]  Pretty good, sir.
[01:40:19.542 --> 01:40:28.250]  This isn't what y'all been talking about, but about three weeks ago, y'all were talking about movies and how they represent certain things in regards to what's happening now.
[01:40:28.831 --> 01:40:32.935]  Yeah, they throw a lot of what they're going to do to us in our face through films.
[01:40:33.355 --> 01:40:34.616]  Three of them I'd like to mention to you.
[01:40:34.696 --> 01:40:35.977]  One of them's a really old movie.
[01:40:36.037 --> 01:40:37.699]  It's probably a little over 60 years old.
[01:40:37.719 --> 01:40:39.941]  It's a Humphrey Bogart movie named The Black Legion.
[01:40:41.182 --> 01:40:44.365]  And it deals with the subject matter of immigrants taking American jobs.
[01:40:45.421 --> 01:40:49.022]  Of course, Humphrey was made out to be the bad guy because he was American and got displaced.
[01:40:50.422 --> 01:40:52.043]  It's an interesting movie for y'all to check out.
[01:40:53.623 --> 01:40:55.804]  Another one is a rather innocuous movie.
[01:40:55.824 --> 01:40:57.284]  Remember Mars Attacks back in 96?
[01:40:57.344 --> 01:40:58.664]  Yeah, it's a good movie.
[01:40:59.605 --> 01:41:03.166]  It had some things in it that ought to be taken note of.
[01:41:03.186 --> 01:41:05.586]  Of course, it's an Alien Agenda type movie.
[01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:11.928]  Number two, when Jack Nicholson claims the President is killed by the little alien leader.
[01:41:12.995 --> 01:41:15.477]  The flag is a pyramid with an all-seeing eye.
[01:41:15.617 --> 01:41:19.380]  You did notice that I didn't hear every show during that time period when you talked about that.
[01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:20.481]  I was wondering if anyone mentioned it.
[01:41:20.821 --> 01:41:31.028]  But did anyone bring up the fact that after the aliens were defeated and the President's daughter was reuniting the country, they had a Mariachi band playing the Star-Spangled Banner?
[01:41:31.629 --> 01:41:31.909]  Yes.
[01:41:32.389 --> 01:41:33.510]  That was pretty odd, too.
[01:41:34.011 --> 01:41:39.615]  But there's a recent movie that I really want to mention that brings out something that people ought to really take heart in.
[01:41:40.776 --> 01:41:41.416]  Cold Mountain.
[01:41:42.981 --> 01:41:45.022]  A movie based on during the time of the Civil War.
[01:41:45.042 --> 01:41:45.983]  Yeah, I haven't seen it.
[01:41:46.443 --> 01:41:48.825]  You need to check it out because... No, I bought it.
[01:41:48.865 --> 01:41:51.466]  I was in a grocery store and did an impulse buy.
[01:41:51.506 --> 01:41:52.587]  I haven't had time to watch it.
[01:41:53.007 --> 01:41:58.090]  Well, of course, the women were left behind by the Confederate soldiers when they went to fight the war.
[01:41:58.110 --> 01:42:01.032]  But, you know, they left in place the thing called the Home Guard.
[01:42:01.052 --> 01:42:02.653]  You know, the older men that couldn't go fight.
[01:42:03.914 --> 01:42:11.999]  And it shows the tyranny of the Home Guard, which is very reminiscent of the home security deal that's going on right now.
[01:42:12.532 --> 01:42:17.755]  And people ought to see, you know, the tyranny that the people lived under, under that system.
[01:42:17.895 --> 01:42:28.360]  Hey, buddy, in Teague, Texas and outside Fairfield, Texas, we've got tombstones at family cemeteries, you know, killed by Northern soldiers during Reconstruction.
[01:42:28.380 --> 01:42:31.022]  I mean, they'd come in, burn the hotel down, rape everybody.
[01:42:31.742 --> 01:42:32.843]  I mean, it was hell on earth.
[01:42:32.903 --> 01:42:33.583]  Thanks for the call.
[01:42:33.603 --> 01:42:34.043]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:34.684 --> 01:42:35.424]  I appreciate it.
[01:42:35.524 --> 01:42:40.907]  Yeah, it's... And then guerrilla forces were formed and they were driven out.
[01:42:41.730 --> 01:42:44.112]  We even drove out two different governors.
[01:42:45.312 --> 01:42:47.674]  Right here in Waterloo, you know it as Austin, Texas.
[01:42:48.574 --> 01:42:55.278]  Alright, let me... It was Austin by then, I just like to use the old name, Waterloo.
[01:42:56.219 --> 01:42:58.940]  Let me try to go back here now.
[01:43:00.221 --> 01:43:04.604]  Since you bring up movies, you know the type of movies I'm talking about, I know quite a few Hollywood people.
[01:43:05.839 --> 01:43:06.779]  And they're not all bad.
[01:43:06.939 --> 01:43:08.680]  Jerry Bruckheimer is actually a government agent.
[01:43:08.720 --> 01:43:09.821]  But a lot of them aren't bad.
[01:43:10.321 --> 01:43:13.102]  And actually, you see this stuff in movies, they're trying to warn you.
[01:43:15.283 --> 01:43:15.863]  I've talked to them.
[01:43:17.143 --> 01:43:23.566]  And that's why you'll see movies like the Long Kiss Goodnight, where the government's going to blow up the World Trade Center for martial law and to get funding.
[01:43:24.210 --> 01:43:30.553]  Or that's what, now they believe that the CIA planted on Chris Carter and others that lone gunman episode.
[01:43:30.593 --> 01:43:32.274]  I've interviewed the star of the show here on the air.
[01:43:32.854 --> 01:43:33.835]  That's what the writers told them.
[01:43:33.855 --> 01:43:38.997]  We think the CIA may have, they said, planted that story of a hijacked jet being flown into the Pentagon.
[01:43:39.478 --> 01:43:41.479]  I mean, in the World Trade Center for Martial Law.
[01:43:42.699 --> 01:43:49.222]  And they said, we don't know if they planted it to try to warn people or if they planted it to condition.
[01:43:49.283 --> 01:43:52.144]  But, you know, they said it was planted.
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.662]  And that's all Dean Haglund would say.
[01:43:55.682 --> 01:43:57.904]  That interview is at PrisonPlanet.tv, by the way.
[01:43:57.924 --> 01:44:01.326]  The audio and the video of that interview, both on the radio and for TV.
[01:44:02.828 --> 01:44:05.710]  But there's just countless films like that.
[01:44:07.191 --> 01:44:09.973]  And so, I mean, this is really what they're doing.
[01:44:10.574 --> 01:44:14.156]  Oh, it's that Robert Duvall movie, Handmaiden's Daughter.
[01:44:15.177 --> 01:44:16.018]  Handmaiden's Tale.
[01:44:17.563 --> 01:44:18.884]  You ought to rent that and watch it.
[01:44:19.004 --> 01:44:23.326]  And the news is an all-seeing eye spinning, you know, as the bug or the icon.
[01:44:24.607 --> 01:44:26.028]  And they wear black uniforms.
[01:44:27.149 --> 01:44:29.510]  And they're, quote, Christian conservatives, but they're really not.
[01:44:29.530 --> 01:44:31.051]  They're basically like devil worshippers.
[01:44:32.171 --> 01:44:38.055]  And they're all, you know, doing drugs, and got all these mistresses, and then they're on TV going, we're moral, we're moral.
[01:44:38.715 --> 01:44:42.077]  And, you know, it's really throwing it in your face, because that's basically what we're getting now.
[01:44:43.478 --> 01:44:45.059]  So there's a lot of those films.
[01:44:46.114 --> 01:44:52.424]  Okay, let me cover some news, and then we'll get into the next hour and take your calls again at 1-800-25599-231.
[01:44:52.464 --> 01:44:54.387]  Lawmaker Ukraine sold Iran-China nukes.
[01:45:01.374 --> 01:45:02.354]  Kiev, Ukraine.
[01:45:02.374 --> 01:45:11.776]  A senior lawmaker on Wednesday called for Ukraine's Prosecutor General to investigate alleged sales of nuclear-capable cruise missiles to Iran and China in violation of international non-proliferation treaties.
[01:45:12.116 --> 01:45:20.978]  The appeal by General Hori Omelchenko follows allegations he made in a letter to the new president, Viktor Yachchenko.
[01:45:21.798 --> 01:45:31.020]  He is a parliamentary member, allied with Prime Minister-designate Yuli Tuminsko, and is a reserve colonel in Ukraine's intelligence service.
[01:45:31.963 --> 01:45:33.343]  I'll get more into this in the next hour.
[01:45:35.004 --> 01:45:40.985]  Also, I guess I'll cover this after the break.
[01:45:41.126 --> 01:45:46.287]  New Republic rider calls for anti-Bush left-wingers to be killed, lined up and shot.
[01:45:46.967 --> 01:45:47.727]  They're not joking.
[01:45:47.747 --> 01:45:49.048]  This is all being done on purpose.
[01:45:49.988 --> 01:45:54.169]  And then drivers may have to give fingerprints in the final states that are now putting this in.
[01:45:54.629 --> 01:45:59.090]  Utah troopers learn to draw blood from suspects on the side of the road, supermarket.
[01:45:59.591 --> 01:46:01.051]  Let your fingers do the paying.
[01:46:02.006 --> 01:46:09.050]  I want to go over all this, but first, this article right here on a World Net Daily.
[01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:13.553]  Gates, Buffett, China run from dollar.
[01:46:13.593 --> 01:46:15.715]  So Gates and Buffett and China are running from the dollar.
[01:46:16.115 --> 01:46:18.977]  Expert sees development as sharp warning to Americans.
[01:46:19.817 --> 01:46:24.520]  Decisions by the world's two wealthiest men to bet on a further weakening of the U.S.
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:30.944]  dollar, coupled with China's lack of confidence that America's currency should grab the attention of every working person, says Craig Smith.
[01:46:31.707 --> 01:46:32.548]  Well, so what?
[01:46:33.469 --> 01:46:41.137]  I mean, Bush says a weak dollar is good, and China's our buddy, and trade deals with China's been milk and honey, folks, so I'm sure everything will be fine.
[01:46:41.598 --> 01:46:43.020]  He said everything was fine last night, didn't he?
[01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:49.547]  Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is following the example of Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett, who made a pretext gain.
[01:46:50.891 --> 01:46:55.476]  Free tax gain of $412 million in the fourth quarter of 2004 by buying foreign currencies.
[01:46:55.496 --> 01:46:58.699]  Of course, I told you to do that three years ago, but now don't listen to me.
[01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:00.180]  It's not hard to do this.
[01:47:00.701 --> 01:47:02.903]  They just tell you one thing and do another.
[01:47:02.923 --> 01:47:05.085]  I remember investing in Ron.
[01:47:05.125 --> 01:47:05.606]  It's great.
[01:47:05.626 --> 01:47:07.328]  You know, CNN and Fox.
[01:47:07.428 --> 01:47:08.729]  I was just going, man, get out of there.
[01:47:08.769 --> 01:47:09.169]  Get out.
[01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:10.271]  Shut up!
[01:47:11.340 --> 01:47:12.341]  I'm doing quite well.
[01:47:13.402 --> 01:47:14.443]  Citing widening U.S.
[01:47:14.503 --> 01:47:21.769]  trade and budget deficits in the federal debt of 7.62 trillion, yeah, 2.4 missing from the Pentagon now, 2.4 trillion.
[01:47:22.209 --> 01:47:28.555]  Gates said in a TV interview at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week that he expects the dollar to extend its three-year decline.
[01:47:28.855 --> 01:47:33.399]  Well, yeah, they called four years ago in Davos, three and a half years ago, to plunge the dollar.
[01:47:33.419 --> 01:47:38.363]  I mean, I watched them on C-SPAN say they're going to tank it to build the euro,
[01:47:39.242 --> 01:47:41.444]  And, uh, again, people don't want to listen, okay?
[01:47:41.464 --> 01:47:42.165]  Don't listen to me!
[01:47:42.185 --> 01:47:51.352]  I mean, they say world government, they say they're going to take your rights, they say they're going to do it, but meanwhile their minions here keep you all in line, telling you everything's okay.
[01:47:51.392 --> 01:47:53.975]  So we'll, we'll get more into this, uh, as well.
[01:47:56.276 --> 01:48:00.420]  After the break, though, I want to get into this call to kill anybody that disagrees with the government.
[01:48:01.368 --> 01:48:08.450]  Before I do that, just briefly here, please take advantage of the specials I'm still offering on my films and books and materials we carry.

[01:49:35.598 --> 01:49:36.819]  A neighbor gave me a copy.
[01:49:36.979 --> 01:49:39.320]  You have had such an incredible effect.
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:40.380]  God bless you.

[01:49:58.065 --> 01:50:02.507]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.647 --> 01:50:07.030]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:08.391]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.222 --> 01:50:09.923]  Hammered.
[01:50:10.204 --> 01:50:14.429]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.489 --> 01:50:21.419]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.

[01:51:06.173 --> 01:51:10.858]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[01:51:18.445 --> 01:51:30.216]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:52:59.797 --> 01:53:00.738]  I can't back down.
[01:53:01.764 --> 01:53:12.408]  When you put all the crimes of the New World Order end to end, let's say each one was about an inch long, it'd probably go around the planet several times.
[01:53:13.568 --> 01:53:19.950]  I mean, so many crimes, so many evil things, so many unbelievable things that are admitted, that aren't debatable.
[01:53:20.850 --> 01:53:22.331]  But still, we trust this government.
[01:53:25.072 --> 01:53:31.074]  And earlier I was trying to get into the analogy of you had a neighbor who you'd caught
[01:53:32.452 --> 01:53:36.554]  Stealing from you, lying to you hundreds of times, would you still be friends with them?
[01:53:36.574 --> 01:53:38.135]  Would you still let them in your house?
[01:53:38.175 --> 01:53:41.977]  Would you give them the keys to your home when you went out of town to house-sit?
[01:53:44.679 --> 01:53:45.959]  Well, it's like that with this government.
[01:53:45.979 --> 01:53:51.002]  I mean, it's because they've got slick packaging and know how to say the right thing to make us feel like they're our friends.
[01:53:51.422 --> 01:53:52.423]  Look at the evidence!
[01:53:53.604 --> 01:53:56.145]  I guess you just don't want to believe you've been taken for a ride.
[01:53:56.825 --> 01:53:58.446]  Oh, okay, then just don't believe it.
[01:53:58.486 --> 01:53:59.527]  Just don't believe me either.
[01:54:01.095 --> 01:54:18.005]  But there is this really scary trend, and this is on PrisonPlanet.com, by the Michael Wieners, and the Tony Blakeleys, and the Ham Cultures, and even the Deputy Attorney General of California, a Democrat, you know, oh, we may arrest protesters because protesting the war, AIDS terrorists.
[01:54:18.826 --> 01:54:19.546]  I'll never forget that.
[01:54:19.606 --> 01:54:26.991]  Two years ago, on the eve of the Gulf War, the New Gulf War, Mr. Calhoun, the Deputy Attorney General of California, said that.
[01:54:28.031 --> 01:54:29.032]  They're all in it together!
[01:54:31.389 --> 01:54:35.993]  And, you know, the left loved under Bill Clinton going out and breaking abortion protesters' arms.
[01:54:36.033 --> 01:54:36.734]  I got video of that.
[01:54:36.754 --> 01:54:38.395]  I'm going to be airing that next week on TV.
[01:54:39.376 --> 01:54:40.077]  You know, they loved it.
[01:54:40.117 --> 01:54:41.258]  And the left just loved it.
[01:54:41.298 --> 01:54:42.339]  Oh, yeah, take their rights.
[01:54:42.399 --> 01:54:43.219]  Now you're losing your rights.
[01:54:43.239 --> 01:54:43.780]  You don't like it.
[01:54:44.981 --> 01:54:58.813]  But now the New Republic, you know, big magazine, big publication, just comes out page after page describing how they want to kill, how they want to kill the Peace Act.
[01:55:00.143 --> 01:55:06.006]  And they mention how he went to a socialist meeting and watched them, and how he wants to kill them.
[01:55:06.486 --> 01:55:07.987]  You know, I don't agree with the socialists.
[01:55:08.047 --> 01:55:09.588]  I mean, they've got a false solution.
[01:55:09.608 --> 01:55:10.928]  This is the false left-right paradigm.
[01:55:11.189 --> 01:55:17.432]  The globalists fund the socialist groups, and they all call for the war being wrong, and say all these reasonable things, and good people then go and join them.
[01:55:18.172 --> 01:55:20.253]  And the globalists control that part of the paradigm as well.
[01:55:21.033 --> 01:55:27.977]  It's the socialist's job to consolidate the people's wealth into government coffers, so it can then be transferred to the criminal corporations that are not free market.
[01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:38.053]  New Republic writer calls for anti-Bush left-wingers to be killed and uh... it gets into the quotes.
[01:55:38.153 --> 01:55:40.073]  They're just mind-boggling.
[01:55:41.294 --> 01:55:43.814]  You can link through and actually read the article.
[01:55:44.795 --> 01:55:48.556]  The words libelous in the New Republic have a proud history of walking arm-in-arm.
[01:55:48.976 --> 01:55:58.679]  Now in the esteemed tradition of former TNR writer who peddled fiction as fact, Stephen Glass of New Republic has stooped to a new low.
[01:55:59.733 --> 01:56:09.361]  Publishing a piece that calls for violence, torture, and even death for leading leftists who dare oppose the Bush's war on terror and the slaughter in Iraq.
[01:56:10.462 --> 01:56:24.955]  Author Tom Frank, clearly from the Glass School of Journalism, the New Republic, has made famous describing sitting in on an anti-war panel sponsored by the International Socialist Organization, the Washington Peace Center, the D.C.
[01:56:25.035 --> 01:56:26.396]  Anti-War Network, and other groups.
[01:56:27.131 --> 01:56:44.745]  After having heard the hundred-plus attendees cheer statements like, money for jobs, education, not for war and occupation, Frank became so riled up, he unloaded a deranged harangue about the suffering he would like to rain upon the people during the organizing of the war.
[01:56:45.346 --> 01:56:46.487]  After Stan Goff
[01:56:47.670 --> 01:56:56.515]  And former Delta Forces soldier and current organizer for Military Family speak out, express sentiments like, we ain't never resolved nothing through an election.
[01:56:57.016 --> 01:56:59.097]  Frank's jag began, clearly.
[01:57:01.764 --> 01:57:08.630]  To do himself, Frank started to fantasize about a Teutonics frong man who could shut Goff up.
[01:57:09.130 --> 01:57:09.891]  And then he goes on.
[01:57:10.211 --> 01:57:17.417]  Frank writes, what I need was a Republican like Arnold Schwarzenegger who would walk up to Goff and punch him in the face.
[01:57:18.278 --> 01:57:23.222]  So it starts there, and then he starts saying, line him up, machine gun him, it's time to kill him.
[01:57:24.643 --> 01:57:26.825]  And again, Tony Blakely, one of the
[01:57:28.054 --> 01:57:33.218]  The Washington Times called for killing, he said seize him and execute him, and gave U.S.
[01:57:33.238 --> 01:57:35.720]  code for it in the Washington Times.
[01:57:35.820 --> 01:57:38.121]  I mean, this is being said everywhere.
[01:57:38.161 --> 01:57:40.022]  I've had people come up and tell me I should be killed.
[01:57:40.583 --> 01:57:41.283]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:50.029 --> 01:57:50.690]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.330 --> 01:57:52.351]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.095 --> 01:57:58.460]  So, on the heels of Tony Blakely and Michelle Malkin and Michael Wiener and
[01:58:18.559 --> 01:58:21.761]  The Hannity's of the world saying arrest people who disagree with the government.
[01:58:22.222 --> 01:58:26.044]  On the heels of all this talk, Tony Blakley saying execute Cy Hirsch.
[01:58:26.465 --> 01:58:29.287]  Seriously, saying arrest him, execute him.
[01:58:30.127 --> 01:58:40.635]  We now have Tom Frank, with the New Republic, fantasizing about Arnold crushing people, lining people who are against the war up, machine gunning them, killing them.
[01:58:41.996 --> 01:58:43.216]  It is so scary.
[01:58:43.637 --> 01:58:45.258]  And that's coming up, and then we'll get into
[01:58:46.711 --> 01:58:51.375]  A new report out of Reuters, CIA faces pressure to divulge ties to ex-Nazis.
[01:58:52.055 --> 01:58:56.039]  A lot of casual society control grid news coming up as well.
[01:58:56.059 --> 01:59:00.182]  But right now, I'm going to take about 15-20 calls in this third hour.
[01:59:00.202 --> 01:59:01.803]  So have your question and comment ready.
[01:59:02.243 --> 01:59:04.525]  And as soon as you hear one caller hang up, you can go to the next.
[01:59:05.126 --> 01:59:07.768]  It'll be your chance to get involved on air by dialing 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:07.788 --> 01:59:09.409]  Let's talk to Ryan in Ohio.
[01:59:09.429 --> 01:59:09.829]  Ryan, welcome.
[01:59:15.427 --> 01:59:15.607]  Yeah.
[01:59:15.627 --> 01:59:16.667]  Can you hear me there?
[01:59:17.087 --> 01:59:18.148]  Loud and clear, sir!
[01:59:18.168 --> 01:59:24.709]  Yeah, I want to know your opinion on this new Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2005, H.R.
[01:59:24.729 --> 01:59:24.709]  259.
[01:59:25.250 --> 01:59:28.250]  Does it end free speech, pretty much?
[01:59:28.650 --> 01:59:29.471]  What is your point?
[01:59:30.031 --> 01:59:31.911]  It expands on it.
[01:59:32.851 --> 01:59:37.113]  I mean, in Philadelphia, we have 11 Christians charged with 47 years in prison.
[01:59:39.654 --> 01:59:41.015]  For admittedly, it's all on video.
[01:59:41.035 --> 01:59:45.178]  The police shot video, they shot video, for praying in a designated protest zone.
[01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:53.784]  Because they said, well, it could have been hurtful what they were saying to the outfest or gay fest or whatever it was called.
[01:59:54.584 --> 01:59:59.247]  And so now if your speech might make somebody angry at you, you get 47 years in prison.
[01:59:59.507 --> 02:00:00.468]  So it's already here.
[02:00:01.849 --> 02:00:02.650]  Alright, Dwight, that's it.
[02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:03.270]  I appreciate it.
[02:00:04.449 --> 02:00:05.449]  I appreciate your call.
[02:00:05.549 --> 02:00:17.814]  Oh yeah, and the judges, the appointees that Bush is putting in office, they're all universally anti-gun, pro-abortion, pro-New World Order.
[02:00:19.415 --> 02:00:23.438]  Abortion funding's up 80 plus percent, but don't tell the so-called Christians that.
[02:00:23.839 --> 02:00:26.941]  They're in this rapture thinking Bush may actually be Jesus.
[02:00:27.241 --> 02:00:28.222]  And folks, I'm not joking.
[02:00:28.943 --> 02:00:35.168]  They're saying he's like this prophet, he is the man of God, he may be, you know, Jesus.
[02:00:35.188 --> 02:00:39.591]  I mean, it's actually, I've been hearing it being said, he may be the Messiah, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:39.931 --> 02:00:42.333]  George Bush, the Skull and Bones fame.
[02:00:42.854 --> 02:00:45.536]  When he's not worshipping in a Shinto shrine, he's praying to Allah, but
[02:00:46.084 --> 02:00:47.184]  He may be the Mahdi.
[02:00:47.364 --> 02:00:48.324]  He may be the Prophet.
[02:00:48.845 --> 02:00:50.085]  He may be more.
[02:00:51.205 --> 02:00:53.105]  Let's talk to David in California.
[02:00:53.165 --> 02:00:54.026]  David, you're on the air.
[02:00:54.046 --> 02:00:55.246]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[02:00:55.426 --> 02:00:55.726]  Good.
[02:00:56.126 --> 02:01:06.848]  Hey, I wanted to kind of expand a little bit on one of your last callers that was talking about movies and the things that they put in movies.
[02:01:06.948 --> 02:01:08.749]  You, of course, have seen The Wizard of Oz.
[02:01:09.829 --> 02:01:10.049]  Yes.
[02:01:11.271 --> 02:01:17.797]  And do you know anything or have you gleaned anything from that movie?
[02:01:18.558 --> 02:01:19.779]  Follow the Elephant Road!
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:23.903]  Well, there's a lot of symbolism in that movie.
[02:01:24.363 --> 02:01:26.025]  Yeah, it's all about the Federal Reserve.
[02:01:26.065 --> 02:01:27.646]  It's all about Follow the Elephant Road.
[02:01:27.686 --> 02:01:33.211]  I mean, I could talk for hours about the admitted symbolism in that story.
[02:01:34.804 --> 02:01:36.165]  Yeah, for example, the Wizard of Oz, what is Oz?
[02:01:36.205 --> 02:01:37.086]  It's the symbol for ounces.
[02:01:50.021 --> 02:01:51.102]  What are ounces measured in?
[02:01:51.162 --> 02:01:51.562]  Gold.
[02:01:52.082 --> 02:01:53.383]  So on and so forth.
[02:01:53.403 --> 02:01:57.324]  The Yellow Brick Road leads to the Emerald City and the man behind the curtain.
[02:01:57.664 --> 02:02:03.907]  The straw man is the legal fiction individual, the paper corporation.
[02:02:03.927 --> 02:02:04.807]  He has no brain.
[02:02:05.788 --> 02:02:08.169]  What is the certificate that he got from the Wizard of Oz?
[02:02:08.249 --> 02:02:09.469]  It's his birth certificate.
[02:02:10.690 --> 02:02:13.691]  What does the 10 stand for?
[02:02:13.731 --> 02:02:15.892]  It stands for Taxpayer Identification Number.
[02:02:16.488 --> 02:02:20.930]  For any of your listeners that aren't familiar with that, just do a quick Google search.
[02:02:21.771 --> 02:02:27.114]  Type in Wizard of Oz, Federal Reserve, and a gazillion different examples.
[02:02:27.174 --> 02:02:27.614]  You know what?
[02:02:27.634 --> 02:02:28.714]  I got a better idea.
[02:02:28.734 --> 02:02:31.936]  David, just don't mind the man behind the curtain.
[02:02:32.997 --> 02:02:34.317]  Do what he says, okay?
[02:02:34.978 --> 02:02:35.718]  Not me, buddy.
[02:02:36.278 --> 02:02:39.160]  Well, you may be without God event.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:40.901]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.921 --> 02:02:41.501]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.487 --> 02:02:47.028]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.188 --> 02:02:50.271]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.411 --> 02:02:54.313]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.353 --> 02:02:58.577]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.937 --> 02:03:02.719]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:04.601]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.881 --> 02:03:08.144]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.184 --> 02:03:12.907]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.068 --> 02:03:16.110]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.290 --> 02:03:19.132]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.633 --> 02:03:25.758]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.278 --> 02:03:30.083]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.483 --> 02:03:31.845]  Order your video today.
[02:03:32.265 --> 02:03:33.246]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.266 --> 02:03:35.549]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.609 --> 02:03:36.850]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:03:44.759 --> 02:03:46.340]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:46.740 --> 02:03:52.484]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:52.724 --> 02:03:57.868]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:58.208 --> 02:04:07.474]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[02:04:44.784 --> 02:04:48.466]  You've heard about Paws from Bio-Ox International and its Bubble Up technology.
[02:04:48.766 --> 02:04:53.048]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up technology?

[02:05:45.163 --> 02:05:50.204]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.584 --> 02:05:52.924]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:55.725 --> 02:06:00.746]  Yeah, the last caller was bringing up movies.
[02:06:02.126 --> 02:06:06.547]  Propaganda in movies, brainwashing in movies, messages in movies.
[02:06:07.027 --> 02:06:11.228]  And you know, you talk to a lot of the directors or writers after the film's made, they'll admit that it was a message.
[02:06:12.199 --> 02:06:15.482]  In fact, they just put out a box set for The Running Man.
[02:06:15.502 --> 02:06:20.405]  I don't know, you know, 20 year anniversary or something like that.
[02:06:21.266 --> 02:06:24.728]  And they've got the writer and the director going, it's horrible!
[02:06:24.768 --> 02:06:26.270]  Look how it's real life with Arnold!
[02:06:26.330 --> 02:06:27.050]  It's terrible!
[02:06:27.491 --> 02:06:29.632]  You know, it really is turning into The Running Man!
[02:06:29.652 --> 02:06:32.634]  And you know, that's on the box set, on the extra DVD.
[02:06:32.654 --> 02:06:36.177]  And they're admitting that we tried to warn people on this film about what was coming.
[02:06:36.577 --> 02:06:38.759]  Then you watch that film and you go, man, they knew what was happening.
[02:06:38.799 --> 02:06:39.600]  They knew what was coming.
[02:06:39.620 --> 02:06:41.321]  And then you, later,
[02:06:42.023 --> 02:06:45.886]  Go listen to the director and the writer and they're like, oh yeah, this is what's happening.
[02:06:47.147 --> 02:06:49.349]  And we can't stand Schwarzenegger.
[02:06:50.570 --> 02:06:55.253]  There's a lot of Hollywood trying to warn you or Hollywood trying to brainwash you.
[02:06:55.553 --> 02:06:56.834]  There's definitely an agenda there.
[02:06:57.955 --> 02:07:01.358]  I mean, what artist doesn't have an agenda and doesn't try to have messages in their art?
[02:07:01.998 --> 02:07:04.220]  Unless they, you know, paint pastoral scenes.
[02:07:05.281 --> 02:07:08.183]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:07:08.783 --> 02:07:09.564]  Alexander!
[02:07:10.820 --> 02:07:13.402]  Alexander calling us from Massachusetts.
[02:07:13.422 --> 02:07:14.243]  Go ahead, Alexander.
[02:07:14.263 --> 02:07:14.904]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:14.964 --> 02:07:15.544]  Mr. Jones.
[02:07:16.025 --> 02:07:16.505]  How you doing?
[02:07:16.805 --> 02:07:17.526]  I'm excellent.
[02:07:17.566 --> 02:07:18.026]  How about you?
[02:07:18.807 --> 02:07:19.548]  I'm doing okay.
[02:07:19.568 --> 02:07:19.888]  Alright.
[02:07:20.048 --> 02:07:20.869]  I have to thank God.
[02:07:20.889 --> 02:07:23.671]  I'm fighting back not doing an imitation of the Lollipop Guild.
[02:07:23.691 --> 02:07:24.872]  Oh, yeah.
[02:07:24.912 --> 02:07:26.334]  Since we were talking about Wizard of Oz.
[02:07:26.494 --> 02:07:26.874]  Go ahead.
[02:07:27.194 --> 02:07:28.215]  That was a pretty good movie.
[02:07:28.275 --> 02:07:29.176]  I've seen some better ones.
[02:07:29.196 --> 02:07:30.217]  Me, too.
[02:07:31.158 --> 02:07:31.478]  Me, too.
[02:07:31.859 --> 02:07:35.702]  And the new Tom Cruise one about War of the Worlds, I'm sure, will get everyone's attention.
[02:07:36.605 --> 02:07:39.388]  Um, but anyway... That's a Steven Spielberg flick.
[02:07:39.648 --> 02:07:42.330]  Yeah, and he puts all sorts of truth into his films, huh?
[02:07:43.451 --> 02:07:45.533]  But, um... Lots of conditioning, yeah.
[02:07:46.354 --> 02:07:47.395]  Yeah, well, alright.
[02:07:47.495 --> 02:07:52.159]  Well, I'm a little excited because I've never gotten on here before, but, um... Well, don't be excited.
[02:07:52.199 --> 02:07:53.060]  It's no big deal.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:54.702]  It's like falling off a log.
[02:07:54.722 --> 02:07:55.843]  Alright, alright.
[02:07:56.043 --> 02:07:56.763]  Well, alright.
[02:07:57.224 --> 02:08:01.087]  I'm on the log and about to fall off, so... You just fell in.
[02:08:01.107 --> 02:08:02.949]  Alright, well...
[02:08:03.604 --> 02:08:08.867]  I'm a spiritual healer, and I know you're all pissed off about them saying that people should do that in schools and stuff.
[02:08:09.107 --> 02:08:10.548]  Do me a favor, watch your language.
[02:08:10.929 --> 02:08:11.849]  Oh, oh, alright, sir.
[02:08:12.169 --> 02:08:13.650]  Yeah, we have a lot of children listening.
[02:08:13.970 --> 02:08:14.351]  My mistake.
[02:08:14.811 --> 02:08:17.673]  No, it's alright, but I mean, you're talking about you're a spiritual healer.
[02:08:17.953 --> 02:08:24.457]  Yeah, well, I do Reiki and Shambhala, and they're actually getting really, really big, and they're all up in India and Japan.
[02:08:24.537 --> 02:08:29.920]  I get started in Japan, and part of it is being sort of a seer and a visionary,
[02:08:30.581 --> 02:08:34.743]  And like, they've got all these kids coming up and they're all really, really powerful psychics.
[02:08:35.103 --> 02:08:36.544]  They call them the Indigo Children.
[02:08:36.764 --> 02:08:38.204]  Well look, let me just tell you something.
[02:08:38.604 --> 02:08:38.805]  Yeah.
[02:08:39.545 --> 02:08:40.305]  I'm a Christian.
[02:08:40.525 --> 02:08:40.705]  Yes.
[02:08:41.326 --> 02:08:43.687]  I believe in Jesus Christ.
[02:08:43.707 --> 02:08:51.450]  So do I. I believe that it's dangerous to start getting involved in all that stuff.
[02:08:52.535 --> 02:08:56.318]  And it leads people over to the dark side.
[02:08:56.338 --> 02:09:00.040]  And I have no doubt that some people are psychic.
[02:09:00.641 --> 02:09:04.063]  I have no doubt that there's a lot of stuff out there.
[02:09:04.083 --> 02:09:06.024]  I think it's very dangerous.
[02:09:06.645 --> 02:09:11.688]  And also there's a lot of kooks who claim that they have all these healing powers and stuff.
[02:09:12.569 --> 02:09:17.092]  And the Bible also says that devils can go and try to heal people.
[02:09:18.072 --> 02:09:18.993]  And fooling people.
[02:09:21.568 --> 02:09:26.852]  There's a lot of weird stuff out there, sir, and I just don't get into it, because I only talk about stuff I can prove.
[02:09:27.253 --> 02:09:28.233]  Right, right.
[02:09:28.313 --> 02:09:29.895]  But there is metaphysics, you know?
[02:09:30.055 --> 02:09:33.477]  Like, life goes beyond just our physical reality, obviously.
[02:09:33.557 --> 02:09:35.739]  And some people choose to explore those realities.
[02:09:35.879 --> 02:09:38.601]  Obviously, Jesus was pretty enlightened, you know?
[02:09:38.741 --> 02:09:40.443]  Oh, he was an enlightened teacher.
[02:09:40.603 --> 02:09:41.063]  Exactly.
[02:09:41.243 --> 02:09:45.086]  And he even said that we could be better than him.
[02:09:45.146 --> 02:09:47.528]  We could do stronger work than he could.
[02:09:48.246 --> 02:09:48.746]  He said that.
[02:09:48.927 --> 02:09:50.168]  What verse is that?
[02:09:50.568 --> 02:09:52.890]  I'm not a Bible buff, so I couldn't really tell you.
[02:09:52.910 --> 02:09:54.131]  I just know it's been said.
[02:09:54.611 --> 02:09:55.552]  It's been said?
[02:09:55.933 --> 02:09:56.853]  Yeah.
[02:09:57.894 --> 02:09:59.996]  Probably was said by Beelzebub.
[02:10:00.877 --> 02:10:01.057]  Who?
[02:10:01.818 --> 02:10:02.478]  Beelzebub.
[02:10:02.978 --> 02:10:03.719]  Yeah, Beelzebub?
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.080]  Beelzebub.
[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:07.702]  Not Beelzebop, Beelzebub.
[02:10:09.024 --> 02:10:09.884]  You know who he is?
[02:10:09.964 --> 02:10:10.305]  I don't.
[02:10:10.805 --> 02:10:11.726]  Not very friendly.
[02:10:12.066 --> 02:10:13.888]  Oh, that sucks.
[02:10:14.188 --> 02:10:15.329]  Well, I'm pretty friendly.
[02:10:16.022 --> 02:10:22.427]  And I try to do the best I can, and people haven't really told me I'm evil for doing what I'm doing, like getting rid of their headaches and stuff.
[02:10:23.307 --> 02:10:24.848]  Well, I mean, have you ever heard of placebo?
[02:10:25.629 --> 02:10:28.771]  Yeah, but, um, hey, if it works, come on.
[02:10:29.795 --> 02:10:32.758]  Well, yeah, but let me just explain something to you.
[02:10:32.978 --> 02:10:33.058]  Sure.
[02:10:33.078 --> 02:10:34.339]  I'm sure you're a smart guy.
[02:10:34.559 --> 02:10:35.260]  I'm pretty smart.
[02:10:35.300 --> 02:10:41.466]  You know, most of the old medicine they would give people would be a placebo, you know, a chalk pill or a sugar pill.
[02:10:42.467 --> 02:10:43.408]  And it worked.
[02:10:43.448 --> 02:10:45.890]  In fact, they found placebo works better than Prozac.
[02:10:46.070 --> 02:10:47.211]  Right.
[02:10:47.291 --> 02:10:51.775]  In real studies, big studies, all the studies, a sugar pill is better than Prozac.
[02:10:51.955 --> 02:10:53.577]  I know, yeah, because people convince themselves.
[02:10:53.597 --> 02:10:53.937]  That's right.
[02:10:54.037 --> 02:10:54.938]  It's mind over matter.
[02:10:56.243 --> 02:10:57.365]  That's part of what I do.
[02:10:57.385 --> 02:10:59.788]  It's because I transform matter.
[02:11:01.370 --> 02:11:01.891]  With my mind.
[02:11:02.772 --> 02:11:03.413]  With my spirit.
[02:11:04.515 --> 02:11:07.359]  Well, what you do is you convince the person
[02:11:08.774 --> 02:11:10.875]  Uh, to, who, who, who?
[02:11:11.195 --> 02:11:13.236]  To let go of whatever is harming them.
[02:11:13.597 --> 02:11:15.357]  Yeah, but that's, that's, that's not you.
[02:11:16.058 --> 02:11:16.578]  I know, I know.
[02:11:16.598 --> 02:11:24.121]  And also, I bet if they got a, you know what, I bet if they just cut their finger off, you can try to go convince them and do the placebo thing, it isn't going to help them very much.
[02:11:24.141 --> 02:11:28.243]  If they've got a little headache, or they're a hypochondriac, it might help them, you know.
[02:11:28.283 --> 02:11:33.346]  People have gotten over very serious illnesses just through practicing this.
[02:11:33.446 --> 02:11:34.106]  Alright, well.
[02:11:34.451 --> 02:11:40.654]  But yeah, part of the whole Chinese history was the mystics versus the materialistics, basically.
[02:11:40.814 --> 02:11:41.935]  Well, I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:11:42.075 --> 02:11:45.176]  I don't think... Look at the fruits, and thanks for the call.
[02:11:45.396 --> 02:11:46.417]  I appreciate it, Alex.
[02:11:47.157 --> 02:11:48.258]  Look at India.
[02:11:49.878 --> 02:11:58.002]  Now, if any place is closer to hell on earth, and I haven't been there, but I have a family that's been there, a lot of friends, talked to a lot of Indians, it's India.
[02:11:58.022 --> 02:11:59.723]  A billion people.
[02:12:00.740 --> 02:12:02.721]  Squalor, dead bodies all over the place.
[02:12:02.741 --> 02:12:04.402]  They just come pick up the dead homeless people.
[02:12:04.782 --> 02:12:06.163]  Piles of manure everywhere.
[02:12:08.905 --> 02:12:11.206]  Rivers full of human affluent.
[02:12:12.306 --> 02:12:13.887]  And detritus.
[02:12:14.988 --> 02:12:16.849]  Just unbelievable.
[02:12:17.669 --> 02:12:18.410]  Look at the fruits.
[02:12:19.731 --> 02:12:21.452]  And an attitude of, oh, you're going to die, so what?
[02:12:21.472 --> 02:12:24.393]  You'll just be back as a carpenter ant.
[02:12:24.493 --> 02:12:25.634]  I mean, so what?
[02:12:27.123 --> 02:12:31.025]  Yeah, the future doesn't matter because we're all going to be back anyways.
[02:12:31.105 --> 02:12:34.788]  And don't worry, that's what Western culture is turning into.
[02:12:36.869 --> 02:12:38.630]  I just don't buy it, sir.
[02:12:38.910 --> 02:12:39.570]  I'm sorry.
[02:12:39.590 --> 02:12:44.153]  Now, one argument against all that is Japanese culture.
[02:12:44.193 --> 02:12:50.257]  It's pretty upright and pretty focused and pretty well put together.
[02:12:50.837 --> 02:12:53.859]  Pretty good fruits, except in some areas.
[02:12:54.708 --> 02:13:03.333]  They've got their own share of problems, and they're not a Christian society, though it's now one of the bigger minority religions in Japan.
[02:13:08.175 --> 02:13:11.997]  You look at almost every country that hasn't been Christian, it's got big problems.
[02:13:12.437 --> 02:13:19.981]  And then people can point at countries that aren't Christian or were Christian, or become Christian and have a bunch of bloodshed.
[02:13:20.442 --> 02:13:23.103]  That's evil people using the banner of Christianity.
[02:13:24.351 --> 02:13:33.056]  But, I'm sorry, magic machine devices that heal all your illnesses if you'll just buy it, or magic creams that heal everything.
[02:13:34.136 --> 02:13:42.901]  Just because the government lies, and just because the doctors do a lot of bad things, and a lot of their treatments are a fraud, then doesn't mean everything that alternative people do is good either.
[02:13:44.622 --> 02:13:50.645]  You have to be quite discriminatory towards everything.
[02:13:51.947 --> 02:13:53.207]  Discerning is a better word.
[02:13:53.227 --> 02:13:55.028]  You've got to, you know, examine.
[02:13:55.048 --> 02:14:03.949]  You know, just like at the grocery store, just because they tell you fresh avocados, you know, as a sales pitch, you better go ahead and squeeze them.
[02:14:04.069 --> 02:14:04.890]  Better smell them.
[02:14:07.150 --> 02:14:07.750]  Oh, whatever.
[02:14:07.850 --> 02:14:14.951]  People just... A lot of this magical thinking, you know, this magical thinking goes hand-in-hand with decline of society.
[02:14:15.652 --> 02:14:17.672]  What I talk about is how at career days,
[02:14:19.950 --> 02:14:29.993]  At public schools, they tell the young girls, you should be topless dancers, they make lots of money, and they tell everybody else, oh, one of the best jobs for you is a psychic palm reader or psychic healer.
[02:14:31.433 --> 02:14:35.214]  See, the industry is shifting in to stuff like that.
[02:14:36.455 --> 02:14:38.155]  And I just don't spend my time on it.
[02:14:38.175 --> 02:14:39.916]  I got a bunch of serious news to cover here.
[02:14:41.036 --> 02:14:45.497]  You know, there's other broadcasts that focus a lot on that, and that's their prerogative, and I'm sure it's entertaining.
[02:14:46.658 --> 02:14:47.278]  I don't do it.
[02:14:48.143 --> 02:14:51.186]  I mean, I'm about real stuff that people already can't deal with.
[02:14:51.566 --> 02:14:53.909]  The government puts cancer viruses in most of the vaccines.
[02:14:54.349 --> 02:15:03.258]  The government, uh, kidnaps children and women and takes them and sells them in Saudi Arabia and Israel and other areas in huge slave brothels.
[02:15:04.619 --> 02:15:08.183]  Uh, the government is run by complete murdering psychopaths.
[02:15:08.763 --> 02:15:09.404]  And I can prove it.
[02:15:09.824 --> 02:15:10.385]  Scientifically.
[02:15:10.665 --> 02:15:11.686]  Up one side and down the other.
[02:15:13.050 --> 02:15:15.951]  I said I want to take a bunch of calls, and we kind of stalled out on that last call.
[02:15:16.011 --> 02:15:16.731]  I apologize.
[02:15:17.171 --> 02:15:18.072]  Rob in Wyoming.
[02:15:18.112 --> 02:15:18.832]  Rob, go ahead.
[02:15:18.852 --> 02:15:19.592]  Hey Alex.
[02:15:20.112 --> 02:15:27.275]  Yeah, the Pharisees accused Jesus of using the power of the devil to heal people, and Jesus answered them quite neatly.
[02:15:28.075 --> 02:15:31.436]  He said, how can Beelzebub make war against Beelzebub?
[02:15:31.476 --> 02:15:32.637]  That doesn't make any sense.
[02:15:32.677 --> 02:15:33.477]  It's a contradiction.
[02:15:34.085 --> 02:15:42.714]  Actually, I'm not the Bible master, but there are also quotes about people using God's name to do good works when really they're evil.
[02:15:43.114 --> 02:15:48.659]  Well, if they're good works, if the outcome is good according to Jesus, then it cannot be from the devil.
[02:15:49.680 --> 02:15:53.124]  Anyway, I called to talk about entertainment.
[02:15:53.604 --> 02:15:58.509]  The old Star Trek was not in favor of world government like its successors.
[02:15:59.349 --> 02:16:01.090]  And there's three examples if I can get to them.
[02:16:01.110 --> 02:16:07.135]  Oh yeah, the new Star Trek is the UN symbol, and world government, and yeah, it really is propaganda, you're right.
[02:16:07.155 --> 02:16:11.017]  The old one wasn't, and the new one is all about shoot-em-up.
[02:16:11.037 --> 02:16:13.779]  The old one had philosophy and thought in it, too.
[02:16:14.540 --> 02:16:18.623]  And a perfect example is when Khan was revived from suspended animation.
[02:16:19.578 --> 02:16:23.320]  He was an Arnold Schwarzenegger type new man, a new leader.
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:24.701]  A super beast man, yeah.
[02:16:24.881 --> 02:16:29.403]  Right, and when they were talking, and Spock is supposed to be the ultimate rational character, right?
[02:16:30.504 --> 02:16:34.926]  Kahn says, you know, around the year 2000, man needed direction.
[02:16:35.486 --> 02:16:38.828]  And Spock says, well, there was the war to end tyranny.
[02:16:38.908 --> 02:16:40.749]  Many considered that a noble effort.
[02:16:41.350 --> 02:16:43.471]  And Kahn goes, tyranny, sir?
[02:16:44.091 --> 02:16:45.992]  We sought to unify the world.
[02:16:46.607 --> 02:16:46.727]  Hey!
[02:16:46.847 --> 02:16:50.169]  You know, I know a lot of people own that whole series.
[02:16:50.189 --> 02:16:51.970]  Will you mail me that?
[02:17:02.357 --> 02:17:02.897]  I don't have it.
[02:17:02.937 --> 02:17:04.238]  I'll try to get a hold of it for you.
[02:17:04.258 --> 02:17:05.098]  There's another one of those.
[02:17:05.118 --> 02:17:06.559]  You know, I almost bought my dad.
[02:17:06.579 --> 02:17:07.779]  He's an old Star Trek fan.
[02:17:07.799 --> 02:17:08.660]  He doesn't like the new ones.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:09.100]  I don't either.
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:13.342]  But I almost, for Christmas, bought my dad the whole series.
[02:17:13.362 --> 02:17:13.682]  It was like $200.
[02:17:13.722 --> 02:17:16.703]  I'm not going to spend that type of money on entertainment.
[02:17:17.183 --> 02:17:24.526]  There's another one where the Klingons, who were like the Nazis back then, they were the bad guys, burst in, take over this planet of calm and gentle folks.
[02:17:25.127 --> 02:17:30.969]  And the head Klingon says, you will find a list, a rather lengthy list, of rules and regulations.
[02:17:31.952 --> 02:17:35.619]  Violation of the smallest of them will be punishable by death.
[02:17:36.040 --> 02:17:36.882]  He was the bad guy.
[02:17:37.002 --> 02:17:38.805]  Well, that's how it is in Iraq now.
[02:17:39.086 --> 02:17:39.827]  Don't have your I.D.
[02:17:39.847 --> 02:17:40.168]  papers?
[02:17:40.188 --> 02:17:41.190]  They kill you on sight.
[02:17:41.290 --> 02:17:42.032]  NBC News.
[02:17:42.473 --> 02:17:43.114]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.916 --> 02:17:48.278]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:17:48.518 --> 02:17:52.361]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:17:52.681 --> 02:17:53.502]  Read the labels.
[02:17:53.922 --> 02:17:58.045]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:58.285 --> 02:18:02.468]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:18:02.848 --> 02:18:07.712]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:18:08.092 --> 02:18:11.674]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:18:11.874 --> 02:18:17.217]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:18:17.477 --> 02:18:20.218]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:18:20.519 --> 02:18:21.419]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:18:53.815 --> 02:18:55.757]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:18:56.237 --> 02:18:57.158]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:57.198 --> 02:18:58.699]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:18:58.739 --> 02:18:59.159]  A 5% increase.
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:02.122]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:19:02.162 --> 02:19:05.384]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:19:15.074 --> 02:19:17.416]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[02:19:17.436 --> 02:19:20.718]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:21.319 --> 02:19:24.361]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:19:48.670 --> 02:19:56.056]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:19:57.157 --> 02:20:06.845]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:20:07.746 --> 02:20:14.331]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[02:20:15.299 --> 02:20:24.141]  We would like to send you a one-year, absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.

[02:20:45.331 --> 02:20:53.936]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:20:54.156 --> 02:21:05.442]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:21:05.662 --> 02:21:08.284]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:08.644 --> 02:21:15.106]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:21:15.266 --> 02:21:17.147]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:21:17.327 --> 02:21:23.349]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:21:23.609 --> 02:21:29.271]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:21:29.591 --> 02:21:33.756]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:21:33.776 --> 02:21:34.396]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:21:34.416 --> 02:21:36.358]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:21:53.214 --> 02:21:54.335]  Alright, I'm going to cover some news.
[02:21:54.375 --> 02:21:57.616]  We'll come back in the next segment and talk to all the patient followers that are holding.
[02:21:58.016 --> 02:22:03.759]  Call the free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:08.582]  So, the headline, New Republic writer calls for anti-Bush left-wingers to be killed.
[02:22:09.442 --> 02:22:15.265]  And he's at this anti-war meeting where they're saying chants like, money for jobs and education, not for war and occupation.
[02:22:15.985 --> 02:22:21.068]  And then Tom Frank of the New Republic continues by writing, Frank writes, what I need
[02:22:22.114 --> 02:22:27.318]  Needed was a Republican like Arnold Schwarzenegger who would walk up to them and punch them in the face.
[02:22:27.998 --> 02:22:33.082]  As the panel continued, every cheer and standing ovation seemed to set Frank deeper down the path of psychosis.
[02:22:33.682 --> 02:22:46.912]  After International Socialist Review editorial board member Sherry Wolf asserted that Iraqis had a right to rebel against occupation, Frank upped the ante in his efforts to intimidate anyone considering entry into the anti-war movement.
[02:22:46.952 --> 02:22:47.292]  He wrote,
[02:22:48.129 --> 02:22:50.210]  These weren't harmless lefties.
[02:22:50.711 --> 02:22:54.433]  I didn't want Nancy Pelosi talking sense to them.
[02:22:54.553 --> 02:23:04.440]  I wanted John Ashcroft to come busting through the wall with a submachine gun to round up everyone for an immediate trip to Gitmo with Charles Grainer on hand for interrogation.
[02:23:05.481 --> 02:23:15.688]  Later, when Wolf quoted Booker Price winning author Roy's defense of the right to resist, Frank was set into such a state of panic
[02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:29.304]  He once again dreamed of the mighty hand of the state repression, writing, maybe sometimes you just want to be on the side of whoever is more likely to take a bunker buster to them.
[02:23:30.465 --> 02:23:36.547]  And then he just goes on and on talking about how he wants to kill them.
[02:23:38.052 --> 02:23:44.615]  And Tony Blakely, the editor of the Washington Times editorial page, a few weeks ago came out, we read the article, and he gave the U.S.
[02:23:44.635 --> 02:23:56.601]  Code for Treason and said, Sy Hersh, Pulitzer Prize winning writer, with the New Yorker Magazine, why he keeps reporting on how we've already got troops in Iran, let's arrest him and execute him.
[02:23:57.461 --> 02:24:03.064]  And Michael Wiener and others, you know, they come out and they say, put people in camps who disagree with the government.
[02:24:04.227 --> 02:24:06.068]  This is how the socialists operate.
[02:24:06.768 --> 02:24:17.614]  When Bill Clinton was in office, the socialists were all calling for arresting pro-life demonstrators and abusing people's rights, and they're arresting Christians who go pray at, you know, outfests or whatever.
[02:24:17.714 --> 02:24:21.936]  Oh, because it might have been hurtful what you were saying, and they face 47 years in prison.
[02:24:22.316 --> 02:24:28.219]  All this is happening, and at Bush's coronation or inauguration, no crosses allowed and no anti-war signs allowed.
[02:24:28.239 --> 02:24:31.461]  You know, they take the freedom of the right wing, they take the freedom of the left wing,
[02:24:31.981 --> 02:24:33.502]  Bottom line, we're losing our freedoms.
[02:24:33.683 --> 02:24:44.611]  And this trend of neocons like Ann Coulter saying, you know, our troops' problems are they're not killing enough civilians.
[02:24:44.671 --> 02:24:46.813]  Let's nuke people for fun.
[02:24:47.473 --> 02:24:51.116]  And now I've got a Marine Corps General today saying shooting people is fun.
[02:24:51.136 --> 02:24:53.098]  You know, all of this is fun.
[02:24:53.118 --> 02:24:55.600]  I mean, this is a really sick view.
[02:24:56.981 --> 02:24:59.863]  And folks, if we don't have the right to speak and
[02:25:00.874 --> 02:25:02.154]  Demonstrate and be involved.
[02:25:02.454 --> 02:25:03.495]  We have no rights.
[02:25:04.275 --> 02:25:10.476]  And so the left is squealing bloody murder right now because all these neocons are talking about killing them or arresting them.
[02:25:10.776 --> 02:25:12.337]  Well, you guys shouldn't be surprised.
[02:25:12.357 --> 02:25:15.278]  You helped set up this mentality in America.
[02:25:15.318 --> 02:25:19.439]  You're pushing for all the hate crimes legislation and hate speech and the rest of it.
[02:25:19.859 --> 02:25:22.539]  So it's time for you to stop helping push this along.
[02:25:23.239 --> 02:25:25.980]  And see, that's where there's no difference between the left and right in this country.
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:29.021]  There's a difference in rhetoric, but not in actions.
[02:25:30.911 --> 02:25:40.257]  There's nothing more un-American than all this talk of killing people that disagree with the government, and putting them in forced labor camps, and, you know, the case for internment camps.
[02:25:40.517 --> 02:25:48.422]  Meanwhile, the border's wide open, and real groups like Mecha and La Raza, that Gonzales is a member of, openly want to break up the U.S.
[02:25:48.482 --> 02:25:53.226]  and return it to Mexico, and Mexico's writing up manuals of how to invade the U.S.
[02:25:53.286 --> 02:25:54.606]  and how to take it over.
[02:25:54.666 --> 02:25:55.507]  I mean, it's sick!
[02:25:56.468 --> 02:25:58.349]  The real threats are being ignored!
[02:25:59.578 --> 02:26:02.659]  While they talk about arresting people for the most petty of things.
[02:26:02.959 --> 02:26:07.101]  They're trying to introduce this to our psychology on purpose.
[02:26:08.301 --> 02:26:12.823]  And it is thoroughly despicable and dangerous.
[02:26:13.641 --> 02:26:21.425]  And so I ask you out there, my fellow Americans, are you going to sacrifice our freedoms on the altar of globalism?
[02:26:21.525 --> 02:26:33.012]  Are you going to destroy our constitutional republic just because your neocon leaders get up on television and the radio and the newspapers and tell everybody how great it is?
[02:26:33.832 --> 02:26:35.974]  When we get back, I'm going to dig it out of the stack here.
[02:26:36.014 --> 02:26:40.096]  I've got the quote somewhere by that Marine Corps General about shooting people is fun,
[02:26:41.168 --> 02:26:43.789]  But before we break, I wanted to cover a few other articles.
[02:26:44.890 --> 02:26:51.072]  This is out of the Gazette Times Associated Press article, Drivers May Have to Give Fingerprints.
[02:26:51.873 --> 02:27:03.257]  And it says, Republican Senators proposed legislation Wednesday that they said would make it more difficult to falsify driver's licenses by requiring electronic fingerprint and facial feature imaging on the driver's license and ID cards.
[02:27:04.038 --> 02:27:06.719]  And again, Oregon is one of the final states to do this.
[02:27:07.415 --> 02:27:08.756]  Forty-plus have already done it.
[02:27:09.176 --> 02:27:17.800]  Under the new federal law passed, all states will have it, and your driver's license is hooked into a federal database, and has federal identifiers, and is really a national ID card.
[02:27:18.741 --> 02:27:29.046]  And that meshes with Utah troopers learn how to draw blood from suspects on the roadside, supermarkets let your fingers do the paying, and much more after this quick break.

[02:27:45.642 --> 02:27:49.864]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[02:27:50.624 --> 02:27:58.889]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:27:59.469 --> 02:28:01.210]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[02:28:01.911 --> 02:28:02.511]  Why you listen,

[02:28:08.509 --> 02:28:10.070]  No more fumbling for the right word.

[02:28:13.351 --> 02:28:15.372]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:28:15.953 --> 02:28:17.033]  And it's so easy.
[02:28:17.734 --> 02:28:19.735]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:28:20.595 --> 02:28:21.215]  When you want.
[02:28:21.756 --> 02:28:22.396]  Where you want.

[02:28:32.394 --> 02:28:32.474]  1-800-419-W.

[02:29:17.838 --> 02:29:21.341]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:29:47.282 --> 02:29:52.747]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.187 --> 02:29:57.732]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:57.852 --> 02:30:04.698]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.058 --> 02:30:11.184]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.324 --> 02:30:12.545]  There are no side effects.

[02:30:34.103 --> 02:30:34.303]  Call today.
[02:31:05.479 --> 02:31:11.902]  All right, Brian and Bart and Brad and Lloyd and Jeremy, everybody, your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[02:31:11.942 --> 02:31:13.243]  I want to go over some news first.
[02:31:13.283 --> 02:31:17.945]  But first off, from my book, 9-11, Dissent and the Tyranny, I wanted to read a few quotes to you.
[02:31:19.425 --> 02:31:28.809]  Out of these troubled times, a new world order can emerge under a United Nations that performs as envisioned by its founders, President George Bush, September 11, 1990, State of the Union Address.
[02:31:31.210 --> 02:31:31.470]  H.G.
[02:31:31.530 --> 02:31:44.913]  Wells, in his book, The New World Order, in 1939, wrote, When the struggle seems to be drifting defiantly towards a world social democracy, there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system.
[02:31:45.413 --> 02:31:49.053]  Countless people will hate the New World Order and will die protesting against it.
[02:31:49.593 --> 02:31:58.355]  When we attempt to evaluate its promise, we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents, many of them quite gallant and graceful-looking people.
[02:31:59.730 --> 02:32:00.611]  They have to die.
[02:32:01.672 --> 02:32:02.593]  You expect me to talk?
[02:32:03.294 --> 02:32:05.316]  No, Mr. Jones, we expect you to die.
[02:32:05.336 --> 02:32:11.842]  We are not going to achieve a New World Order without paying for it in blood, as well as in words and money.
[02:32:12.223 --> 02:32:16.287]  Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., CFR Publish Foreign Affairs, July-August Issue, 95.
[02:32:18.075 --> 02:32:20.399]  Today, America would be outraged if U.N.
[02:32:20.419 --> 02:32:22.702]  troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[02:32:22.823 --> 02:32:24.425]  Tomorrow, they will be grateful.
[02:32:24.465 --> 02:32:30.375]  This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated.
[02:32:30.945 --> 02:32:32.566]  that threatened our very existence.
[02:32:32.666 --> 02:32:37.127]  It is then that all people of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil.
[02:32:37.547 --> 02:32:39.528]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
[02:32:39.848 --> 02:32:48.010]  When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being, granted to them by their world government.
[02:32:49.191 --> 02:32:51.771]  Dr. Henry Kissinger, Bilderberg Conference, Amiens, France, 1991.
[02:32:53.312 --> 02:32:57.013]  If this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:32:57.580 --> 02:32:59.761]  George W. Bush, December 18, 2000, CNN.
[02:33:00.702 --> 02:33:01.803]  I got the video clip of that.
[02:33:02.503 --> 02:33:06.966]  In short, the House of World Order will have to be built from the bottom up rather than the top down.
[02:33:07.006 --> 02:33:12.010]  It will look like the great booming, buzzing confusion, to use William James' famous description of reality.
[02:33:12.510 --> 02:33:19.455]  But an end drawn around a national sovereignty eroding it piece by piece will accomplish much more than the old-fashioned frontal assault.
[02:33:20.015 --> 02:33:22.396]  Richard N. Gardner in Foreign Affairs, April 74.
[02:33:24.773 --> 02:33:28.675]  No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer.
[02:33:29.195 --> 02:33:33.557]  No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation.
[02:33:33.898 --> 02:33:37.379]  David Spangler, Director of Planetary Initiative, United Nations document.
[02:33:38.660 --> 02:33:44.783]  A total world population of 250 to 300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels would be ideal.
[02:33:44.843 --> 02:33:47.084]  Ted Turner and Autobond Magazine.
[02:33:48.917 --> 02:33:55.839]  In the event that I am reincarnated, I would like to return as a deadly virus in order to contribute something to solve overpopulation.
[02:33:56.219 --> 02:33:59.961]  Prince Philip, reported by the Deutsch Press in August of 1988.
[02:34:01.301 --> 02:34:08.083]  Another quote from his own book of I Were an Animal, His Royal Highness, published by Robin Clark Ltd.
[02:34:08.543 --> 02:34:12.665]  I must confess that I am tempted to ask for reincarnation as a particular deadly virus.
[02:34:13.165 --> 02:34:17.166]  Another quote of the Duke of Edinburgh in the preface to Down to Earth.
[02:34:18.118 --> 02:34:27.685]  I don't claim to have any special interest in natural history, but as a boy I was aware of the annual fluctuations, the number of game animals, and the need to adjust the cull to the size of the surplus population.
[02:34:28.486 --> 02:34:32.129]  David Rockefeller, we are on the verge of a global transformation.
[02:34:32.629 --> 02:34:37.373]  All we need is the right major crisis, and the nations will accept the New World Order.
[02:34:38.514 --> 02:34:44.018]  It is the sacred principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter to which the American people henceforth pledge their allegiance.
[02:34:45.009 --> 02:34:45.730]  Speak for yourself.
[02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:51.274]  President George Herbert Walker Bush addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, February 1st, 1992.
[02:34:52.495 --> 02:35:01.682]  But this present window of opportunity during which a truly peaceful and interdependent world order might be built will not be open for long.
[02:35:01.762 --> 02:35:09.168]  Already there are powerful forces at work that threaten to destroy all our hopes and efforts to erect an enduring structure of global interdependence.
[02:35:09.508 --> 02:35:13.131]  David Rockefeller speaking at the Business Conference for the United Nations, September 14th, 1994.
[02:35:15.675 --> 02:35:18.396]  In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete.
[02:35:18.836 --> 02:35:21.137]  All states will recognize a single global authority.
[02:35:21.477 --> 02:35:29.780]  National sovereignty wasn't such a great idea after all, scrubbed Talbot, President Clinton's Deputy Secretary of State, as quoted in Time Magazine July 20th, 92.
[02:35:31.061 --> 02:35:40.684]  We shall have world government whether or not you like it, by conquest or consent, statement by Council on Foreign Relations member James Warmburg to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17th, 1950.
[02:35:43.223 --> 02:35:48.625]  Our task of creating a socialist America can only succeed when those who would resist us have been totally disarmed.
[02:35:48.946 --> 02:35:55.729]  Sarah Brady, Chairman of Handgun Control Incorporated, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, the National Educator, January 94, page 3.
[02:35:55.909 --> 02:36:05.673]  Well, we got organized as a country and wrote a fairly radical constitution with a radical Bill of Rights, giving a radical amount of individual freedom to Americans.
[02:36:06.886 --> 02:36:09.168]  And so a lot of people say there's too much personal freedom.
[02:36:09.588 --> 02:36:12.130]  When personal freedom is being abused, you have to move to limit it.
[02:36:12.591 --> 02:36:22.338]  And that's what we did in this announcement I made last weekend on the public housing projects about how we're going to have weapon sweeps and more things like that to try to make people safe in their communities.
[02:36:22.719 --> 02:36:26.162]  President Bill Clinton, March 22, 1994, MTV's Enough is Enough.
[02:36:26.582 --> 02:36:30.465]  This is USA Today, March 11, 1993, page 2A USA Today.
[02:36:30.925 --> 02:36:35.169]  We can't be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans.
[02:36:37.458 --> 02:36:41.639]  Here's a good quote by Representative Henry B. Gonzales, August 29th, 1994.
[02:36:41.719 --> 02:36:47.580]  I actually have this quote in one of my videos, American Story by Design, the actual video of him saying it.
[02:36:48.100 --> 02:37:00.903]  The truth of the matter is, you do have those standby provisions and the statutory emergency plans are there, whereby you could, in the name of stopping terrorism, apprehend, invoke the military and arrest Americans and hold them in detention camps.
[02:37:03.766 --> 02:37:04.567]  It goes on and on.
[02:37:04.607 --> 02:37:06.908]  I got Mikhail Gorbachev calling for a New World Order.
[02:37:07.389 --> 02:37:20.238]  I got Professor Carol Quigley, Julian Huxley, Senate Reports, Fabian Socialist Bernard Shaw, Adolf Hitler, and other slimeballs calling for this Joseph Goebbels.
[02:37:23.271 --> 02:37:27.014]  Let's go ahead and get into some more news, then I'll go to your calls.
[02:37:27.434 --> 02:37:30.456]  Here's that article out of NBC News, San Diego.
[02:37:30.897 --> 02:37:31.557]  Top U.S.
[02:37:31.577 --> 02:37:33.599]  Marine General, it's fun to shoot people.
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:41.584]  At a panel discussion in San Diego Tuesday, a top Marine General tells an audience that, among other things, it's fun to shoot some people.
[02:37:42.285 --> 02:37:47.668]  The comment, made by Lieutenant General James Mattis, came in reference to fighting insurgents in Iraq.
[02:37:47.688 --> 02:37:50.110]  He went on to say, actually, it's a lot of fun to fight.
[02:37:50.430 --> 02:37:50.971]  You know, it's
[02:37:52.046 --> 02:37:53.307]  A hell of a hoot.
[02:37:54.568 --> 02:37:55.788]  I like brawling.
[02:37:57.970 --> 02:38:03.873]  And, uh, you go into Afghanistan, you got guys who slapped women around for five years because they didn't wear a veil.
[02:38:04.454 --> 02:38:11.158]  Matt has continued, you know, these guys, like, they ain't got no manhood left anyway, so it's a hell of a lot of fun to shoot them.
[02:38:13.019 --> 02:38:13.859]  About 200 people gathered
[02:38:15.532 --> 02:38:25.097]  For the discussion held at the San Diego Convention Center, while many military members laughed at the comments, a military expert interviewed by NBC News called the comments flippant.
[02:38:25.778 --> 02:38:30.300]  Yeah, I mean, look, you don't... Sure, the Marines are trained killers, devil dogs, what they do.
[02:38:31.141 --> 02:38:33.002]  And, you know, I mean, for some people it's fun.
[02:38:33.022 --> 02:38:34.282]  I mean, it's like hunting or something.
[02:38:34.302 --> 02:38:44.368]  You get into it, I guess, and... The problem is you're not supposed to do that, because then you go across the line, you start liking it, it's like a dog that likes a taste of blood,
[02:38:45.279 --> 02:38:47.160]  And they're gonna come back here and be cops, folks.
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:49.601]  And, uh, they've killed a lot of innocent people.
[02:38:49.641 --> 02:38:56.704]  I mean, there's been video shot and there's articles where there were reporters and a woman's walking down the street and for fun and irate, they just blow her head off.
[02:38:56.744 --> 02:38:58.145]  I mean, these are human beings, folks.
[02:38:59.546 --> 02:39:05.168]  And, uh, you know, they can talk about, uh, well, these guys abuse women, so let's kill them all.
[02:39:05.628 --> 02:39:12.692]  That was like Gruckheimer in the Ithaca Journal, where he came back and said, yeah, we went into whole villages and killed men, women, and children.
[02:39:12.732 --> 02:39:13.592]  We just killed everybody.
[02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:17.812]  And then Fox News, I have it on video, came on and said, well, the Pentagon's clarifying.
[02:39:17.852 --> 02:39:19.693]  Yes, in some areas, they're ordered to kill everyone.
[02:39:20.233 --> 02:39:21.253]  Yeah, they think there's insurgents.
[02:39:21.293 --> 02:39:22.894]  Like, oh, well, that's for clarification.
[02:39:22.914 --> 02:39:29.938]  It's like Pat Robertson, you know, comes out and says, well, forced abortion's what they gotta do in China, and then his clarification is, well, they got too many people.
[02:39:30.358 --> 02:39:31.498]  Oh, well, thanks for clarifying it.
[02:39:31.598 --> 02:39:33.439]  You know, I'm not making these statements.
[02:39:33.799 --> 02:39:34.220]  They are.
[02:39:34.240 --> 02:39:37.181]  It's just these amazing statements.
[02:39:38.448 --> 02:39:43.469]  And, uh, you know, we didn't have generals in the past that sat around making jokes about killing people.
[02:39:43.789 --> 02:39:45.410]  Oh, it's so much fun to kill people.
[02:39:45.430 --> 02:39:50.891]  I mean, I've talked to a lot of World War II vets and Korean War vets and Vietnam vets who've killed a lot of people.
[02:39:51.791 --> 02:39:53.892]  And they never got happy about it.
[02:39:55.032 --> 02:39:57.172]  They were always kinda like they got nauseated.
[02:39:57.192 --> 02:40:01.613]  Uh, you know, I mean, even if you're gonna go out and kill people, it's not something you're supposed to enjoy.
[02:40:02.814 --> 02:40:04.894]  Uh, but, uh, I mean, the Nazis enjoyed it.
[02:40:06.992 --> 02:40:20.757]  But what's even worse is these armchair quarterbacks who've never been in a bad fistfight, you know, never, like I've said, never been in a car wreck, never had a bull run them over, never done anything scary, they're just so soft.
[02:40:22.358 --> 02:40:24.158]  And they'll just sit back and go, kill them, kill them all.
[02:40:24.178 --> 02:40:24.919]  It's like Ann Coulter.
[02:40:24.999 --> 02:40:27.400]  Our problem with our troops is they're not killing enough civilians.
[02:40:27.980 --> 02:40:33.682]  I mean, it was like weird, flippant, just ultra-decadent, disconnected statements.
[02:40:35.450 --> 02:40:38.691]  Number one, that's not going to win their hearts and minds, just running around killing people.
[02:40:39.131 --> 02:40:42.652]  You know, the Nazis would have won in Russia, but they were so abusive.
[02:40:42.672 --> 02:40:48.034]  You know, the crowds met them as... and hailed them as saviors, because, you know, the Soviets were bad news.
[02:40:48.834 --> 02:40:53.636]  And pretty soon, though, they all turned against the Nazis, because they found out, man, these people are... these people are brutal!
[02:40:55.096 --> 02:41:00.698]  You know, they like... march people out in the street and beat their brains in with crowbars for fun.
[02:41:00.718 --> 02:41:02.599]  I mean, this is... might as well fight them!
[02:41:05.655 --> 02:41:07.837]  But again, they just want this attitude.
[02:41:07.997 --> 02:41:09.618]  And we've become very decadent, folks.
[02:41:09.638 --> 02:41:10.599]  Look at the violence on TV.
[02:41:10.619 --> 02:41:11.879]  Just look at the culture in general.
[02:41:13.761 --> 02:41:14.561]  It's so scary.
[02:41:14.862 --> 02:41:15.582]  Very, very scary.
[02:41:15.602 --> 02:41:19.485]  And the attitude is, let's do this to Americans that disagree with the war.
[02:41:20.105 --> 02:41:21.646]  Well, you've just killed America, then.
[02:41:21.686 --> 02:41:24.588]  Because America is about dissent.
[02:41:24.728 --> 02:41:25.289]  It is about
[02:41:26.042 --> 02:41:27.083]  Uh, having your own views.
[02:41:27.363 --> 02:41:29.405]  People will say, oh, leave America if you don't like it.
[02:41:29.705 --> 02:41:32.307]  No, no, you need to leave America if you think I should leave America.
[02:41:32.727 --> 02:41:34.909]  America is about having your own views.
[02:41:35.189 --> 02:41:36.870]  Having your own freedom to say what you want.
[02:41:37.731 --> 02:41:43.756]  Uh, let's talk to, uh, I'm told Brian in Oregon disagrees with me, so he's at the back of the line, but he goes to the front of the line.
[02:41:44.196 --> 02:41:45.477]  Uh, quickly, Brian, go ahead.
[02:41:46.693 --> 02:41:47.775]  Yes, I'll be very quick.
[02:41:48.035 --> 02:41:51.982]  I agree with almost everything you present, but John 14, 12, it says,
[02:42:00.812 --> 02:42:06.576]  And greater works than these shall he do, because I go unto my Father.
[02:42:06.696 --> 02:42:19.425]  All I asked the guy, because earlier you told the guy answering the phones, we don't screen calls, but you told him this, that according to him, and I don't think Scott makes stuff up, you told him that I had said the verse didn't exist.
[02:42:19.945 --> 02:42:22.047]  I believe I said, I'm not aware of that.
[02:42:22.725 --> 02:42:32.672]  Oh no, I just said, um, I disagree with some of your sentiments and some of your tone towards this and some peculiarities that would be difficult to go into.
[02:42:33.172 --> 02:42:36.094]  But, um, I just wanted to bring up that the verse does exist.
[02:42:36.115 --> 02:42:42.299]  You said it, the actual bub in sort of a sarcastic tone said it, and it was actually about Jesus.
[02:42:42.419 --> 02:42:44.200]  It's a very powerful verse to me.
[02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:47.763]  I wasn't talking about the verse being the LZ bub, I was saying...
[02:42:48.483 --> 02:42:56.125]  That people saying, oh, Christ was just a great teacher, and oh, and you know, all this stuff about... Oh, yeah.
[02:42:56.205 --> 02:42:56.825]  I agree completely.
[02:42:56.885 --> 02:42:57.825]  I just wanted to clear that up.
[02:42:58.225 --> 02:42:59.405]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:43:00.346 --> 02:43:03.486]  And look, this is why I don't quote the Bible.
[02:43:03.526 --> 02:43:05.487]  This is why this is not a religious broadcast.
[02:43:05.567 --> 02:43:10.368]  I make no excuse about, or no secret of the fact, you know, that I'm a Christian.
[02:43:10.908 --> 02:43:11.968]  And I'm not going to hide that.
[02:43:13.768 --> 02:43:14.029]  Okay?
[02:43:14.049 --> 02:43:14.829]  Like a lot of people do.
[02:43:14.869 --> 02:43:15.849]  Because if you don't confess
[02:43:16.833 --> 02:43:20.014]  Uh, you know, your belief in front of the public, well, he won't do that to the Father.
[02:43:20.794 --> 02:43:26.836]  But this is a news broadcast, an analysis broadcast, and I leave the preaching to the preachers.
[02:43:27.756 --> 02:43:34.158]  And there's a thousand different denominations and subgroups, and that's all it is, is fight with each other and argue, verses, and that's fine.
[02:43:34.818 --> 02:43:39.199]  But for this broadcast, you know, I don't, it's like, I don't talk about UFOs.
[02:43:39.939 --> 02:43:43.200]  It's fine for other people to talk about UFOs, it's just not the format.
[02:43:43.800 --> 02:43:45.821]  You know, I, but again,
[02:43:46.539 --> 02:43:48.180]  The format isn't just what I talk about.
[02:43:48.781 --> 02:43:50.622]  You can always introduce what you want to the show.
[02:43:51.402 --> 02:43:51.642]  Okay?
[02:43:51.662 --> 02:43:52.463]  Because it's free speech.
[02:43:52.643 --> 02:43:53.244]  You just call in.
[02:43:53.264 --> 02:43:54.524]  We say, where are you calling from?
[02:43:54.544 --> 02:43:55.245]  What's your first name?
[02:43:55.665 --> 02:43:56.946]  Occasionally we say, how are you listening?
[02:43:57.286 --> 02:44:00.008]  We should re-implement that, though, so we can plug the great stations we're on.
[02:44:00.028 --> 02:44:01.669]  I've been doing that the last few years.
[02:44:01.689 --> 02:44:03.891]  I need to start asking folks how they're listening, too.
[02:44:05.350 --> 02:44:06.811]  Alright, let's keep going to the calls here.
[02:44:06.831 --> 02:44:08.293]  Let's talk to Bart in Texas.
[02:44:08.373 --> 02:44:08.994]  Bart, go ahead.
[02:44:09.014 --> 02:44:09.534]  You're on the air.
[02:44:09.554 --> 02:44:10.635]  Hey Alex.
[02:44:11.316 --> 02:44:20.764]  Well, you know, I think a good point is, you know, the New World Order and Luciferianism in general is fueled by delusion and illusion.
[02:44:21.205 --> 02:44:21.585]  That's it.
[02:44:21.605 --> 02:44:23.387]  That's why I don't like magical thinking.
[02:44:24.147 --> 02:44:24.787]  Well, exactly.
[02:44:24.807 --> 02:44:32.450]  You know, I mean, I think that there's definitely an argument for having active spiritualism with your Christianity, but I think that's for each person.
[02:44:32.811 --> 02:44:37.112]  The problem is, is so many people get sucked into the God complex of having the power.
[02:44:37.172 --> 02:44:45.856]  You know, and you can kind of even hear it in that kid's voice, that, you know, it's obvious that he's trying to do good, but he's also getting off on the idea of expressing that power.
[02:44:46.576 --> 02:44:49.558]  But, uh, that's not really what I wanted to talk about.
[02:44:49.578 --> 02:44:50.338]  You know, there's a general
[02:44:51.047 --> 02:45:04.297]  Talking about what he was saying about enjoying killing people and all these really un-American ideas that are wrapped in Americanism and patriotism is the core of the reprogramming that's going on in our society.
[02:45:04.937 --> 02:45:06.318]  It's taking two opposites.
[02:45:06.478 --> 02:45:07.899]  I mean, it's the total synthesis.
[02:45:07.979 --> 02:45:11.082]  Oh yeah, this three-star general just didn't say that for fun.
[02:45:11.502 --> 02:45:15.305]  They're not on the news saying, let's kill anybody that disagrees with the government in America.
[02:45:15.525 --> 02:45:16.786]  Let's line them up and shoot them.
[02:45:18.151 --> 02:45:22.033]  I mean, they're not saying this for, you know, just accidentally.
[02:45:22.954 --> 02:45:27.076]  That's why pragmatism is the real poison in the milk for our country.
[02:45:27.116 --> 02:45:30.418]  It's how we've been led down, it's how we've been led to hell.
[02:45:30.818 --> 02:45:32.699]  It's the road of good intentions.
[02:45:32.739 --> 02:45:37.481]  You know, people have ceased to look at the end outcome and the real meat and potatoes.
[02:45:37.501 --> 02:45:37.962]  Well, that's right.
[02:45:37.982 --> 02:45:43.084]  When you change your moral compass, well, because them Arabs are animals, so let's just be worse than them.
[02:45:43.385 --> 02:45:46.066]  Well, when you do that, folks, you just became what you're fighting.
[02:45:47.051 --> 02:45:48.752]  And one last thing before I go, Alex.
[02:45:49.393 --> 02:45:50.794]  I've been trying for a while.
[02:45:51.254 --> 02:45:53.056]  I'm dying to get an interview with you, man.
[02:45:53.096 --> 02:45:55.878]  I've been emailing your people for a while now.
[02:45:55.918 --> 02:45:58.119]  You know, I'm going to be at this Indy media conference.
[02:45:58.179 --> 02:45:59.120]  Listen, listen, listen.
[02:45:59.280 --> 02:46:02.182]  Everything's on hold until I finish Martial Law.
[02:46:02.463 --> 02:46:07.807]  I'm working 18 hours a day and then until I finish the Arnold commercials and then give out the prizes for other people.
[02:46:08.107 --> 02:46:14.352]  I'm doing those two things and I'm turning down radio interviews, you know, on stuff like
[02:46:15.862 --> 02:46:17.783]  I've turned down probably 10 radio interviews this week.
[02:46:18.404 --> 02:46:22.486]  I've turned down... I feel you brother, I'm entering that Arnold Exposed contest.
[02:46:22.526 --> 02:46:24.567]  I'm going to have my video out to you next week.
[02:46:24.587 --> 02:46:27.269]  That's why we extended it because a lot of folks just procrastinated.
[02:46:27.289 --> 02:46:28.230]  Alright, I've got to let you go.
[02:46:28.270 --> 02:46:28.790]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:29.170 --> 02:46:31.011]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:31.051 --> 02:46:31.852]  Who's up next here?
[02:46:33.393 --> 02:46:34.673]  Brad in Illinois, go ahead.
[02:46:34.793 --> 02:46:38.876]  Hey, I just wanted to get this on your show, Alex, for all the people in Illinois that listen to your show.
[02:46:39.508 --> 02:46:42.700]  Wednesday I had a letter in the newspaper in the Chicago Sun-Times.
[02:46:42.760 --> 02:46:45.831]  I talked about Social Security reform and I made the comment that
[02:46:46.420 --> 02:46:59.088]  President Bush could reform Social Security with an executive order if he would eliminate all of these private government pensions such as policemen, firemen, municipal workers, senators, congressmen, and just put them all into Social Security.
[02:46:59.569 --> 02:47:03.371]  Isn't that funny how the government gives itself its own pension?
[02:47:03.692 --> 02:47:09.315]  Right, and of course, lo and behold, the very next morning I get a phone call from a gentleman who's a retired Chicago cop.
[02:47:09.856 --> 02:47:16.080]  Of course, he used Star 63 to block his name and relocate out after I used my name in the newspaper.
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:22.926]  He calls me up to tell me that he puts 9.5% of his money into his pension.
[02:47:23.126 --> 02:47:27.570]  I showed him how he doesn't really have any money except it's the taxpayer's money.
[02:47:27.931 --> 02:47:31.134]  He's putting 9.5% of the taxpayer's money into his pension.
[02:47:33.877 --> 02:47:36.619]  Uh, double that, 9.5% when he retires.
[02:47:37.139 --> 02:47:40.361]  I pointed out that he was 55 years of age and he's retired.
[02:47:40.401 --> 02:47:47.886]  He's getting $3,700 a month when a Social Security recipient has to work the $6,700 currently to get $1,250 a month.
[02:47:47.926 --> 02:47:55.551]  And he told me, he said, well, policemen and firemen are better than someone just sitting on a roof nailing nails into a roof.
[02:47:56.404 --> 02:48:00.688]  I've had cops tell me, I've gone, hey, I pay your salary, and he goes, no, I pay my own salary.
[02:48:00.708 --> 02:48:01.268]  Yeah, right.
[02:48:01.349 --> 02:48:02.870]  And I said, is that so?
[02:48:02.890 --> 02:48:04.511]  I said, do you live in a house?
[02:48:04.571 --> 02:48:04.972]  He goes, yeah.
[02:48:04.992 --> 02:48:06.313]  I said, did you build a house yourself?
[02:48:07.034 --> 02:48:07.554]  He said, no.
[02:48:07.574 --> 02:48:10.275]  I said, well it's quite obvious that this is a pile of nails.
[02:48:10.295 --> 02:48:11.415]  This is what the war is going to be.
[02:48:11.455 --> 02:48:15.397]  It's going to be between the government people who are taken care of and the rest of us who aren't.
[02:48:15.657 --> 02:48:16.217]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:48:16.277 --> 02:48:16.797]  I agree with you.
[02:48:16.837 --> 02:48:26.480]  So then I told him, I said, you know something, I said, why don't you put what you just told me in a letter and send it to Chicago Sun-Times so you people are better off than everybody else.
[02:48:26.900 --> 02:48:29.721]  And put your name on the bottom before he hung the phone up.
[02:48:30.041 --> 02:48:31.121]  But you know, it's really amazing.
[02:48:31.161 --> 02:48:33.702]  I just wanted to get to everybody in Illinois that was listening to that.
[02:48:34.787 --> 02:48:36.548]  So he got so mad he called you.
[02:48:36.928 --> 02:48:38.308]  Oh yeah, he was upset.
[02:48:38.328 --> 02:48:38.888]  Well, good!
[02:48:38.988 --> 02:48:39.989]  I mean, I'm glad he's upset.
[02:48:40.029 --> 02:48:41.089]  I'm glad he's taking action.
[02:48:41.809 --> 02:48:43.610]  And then look, I'm not saying we should take their pensions.
[02:48:43.710 --> 02:48:44.470]  We'll be back.
[02:48:45.890 --> 02:48:50.232]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.392 --> 02:48:54.833]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.973 --> 02:48:59.354]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.394 --> 02:49:00.735]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:02.480]  Panama.
[02:49:02.540 --> 02:49:06.762]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.802 --> 02:49:13.744]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.864 --> 02:49:15.924]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.124 --> 02:49:26.607]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.867 --> 02:49:28.848]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,

[02:51:50.387 --> 02:51:52.309]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.769 --> 02:51:55.591]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:56.452 --> 02:51:59.555]  Corruption through the lies and disinformation.
[02:52:00.295 --> 02:52:03.978]  The CIA faces pressure to divulge ties to ex-Nazi links.
[02:52:04.419 --> 02:52:05.740]  This out of Reuters, a U.S.
[02:52:05.780 --> 02:52:16.609]  Senator demanded on Wednesday that the CIA director release thousands of pages of documents detailing the agency's ties with former Nazis who aided in Cold War espionage against the Soviet Union official said.
[02:52:17.398 --> 02:52:18.619]  And folks, they ran everything.
[02:52:18.659 --> 02:52:23.884]  Government drug dealing, government torture training programs, the rocket programs, everything.
[02:52:24.204 --> 02:52:26.666]  Nazi-run buildings named after Nazis.
[02:52:27.087 --> 02:52:28.088]  It's a public secret.
[02:52:28.528 --> 02:52:41.840]  Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio, Republican co-author of the 98 Bill, ordering the disclosures of the government records on Nazi war criminals, wants CI Director Porter Goss, good luck, to say publicly why his agency will not agree to divulge the records.
[02:52:42.220 --> 02:52:43.781]  Because it'll show they work with the Bushes.
[02:52:45.018 --> 02:52:48.059]  One reason they're not going to release it, folks.
[02:52:48.539 --> 02:52:55.382]  Including Joseph Mingala, who was for torture, by the way, which you now promote as good, some of you out there.
[02:52:56.803 --> 02:52:57.343]  Just amazing.
[02:52:57.363 --> 02:53:00.264]  A man shot with a stun gun nine times dies.
[02:53:01.264 --> 02:53:03.705]  A county inmate died after being shot nine times.
[02:53:03.745 --> 02:53:12.909]  He banged on the plexiglass, demanding food, and so they walked in, tasered him nine times, and he died.
[02:53:14.091 --> 02:53:15.372]  So, uh, well, death penalty.
[02:53:16.032 --> 02:53:19.974]  They're judge, jury, and executioners, and they're putting in national ID cards in England.
[02:53:20.394 --> 02:53:25.456]  Putin hails military ties between Russia and China, but the Pentagon tells us China's our friend.
[02:53:25.776 --> 02:53:28.557]  Let's just go after Iran, because they've done absolutely nothing.
[02:53:29.218 --> 02:53:32.759]  And, uh, that's basically about it for now, folks.
[02:53:33.640 --> 02:53:37.221]  Uh, before I talk to Lloyd in Minnesota, last caller I have time to go to.
[02:53:37.261 --> 02:53:39.262]  Sorry, I know the lines are loaded here.

[02:53:48.732 --> 02:53:49.433]  They're powerful.
[02:53:50.354 --> 02:53:51.054]  They're frightening.
[02:53:51.534 --> 02:53:54.657]  They're videos you need to have, you need to make copies of and give to people.

[02:54:23.462 --> 02:54:24.723]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[02:54:50.657 --> 02:54:57.341]  A few weeks ago you were talking about Stanley Hilton's case being thrown out of court and that you were going to have him on.
[02:54:57.541 --> 02:55:00.902]  Yeah, he had to cancel that the day he was coming on because of court.
[02:55:01.083 --> 02:55:02.103]  Court date got changed.
[02:55:02.143 --> 02:55:03.544]  We're going to have him up soon.
[02:55:03.564 --> 02:55:03.824]  Okay.
[02:55:03.984 --> 02:55:07.306]  Well, I was wondering about that because I'd like to get the details on that.
[02:55:07.366 --> 02:55:13.109]  Well, he's Bob Dole's former Chief of Staff, Sid Bush, for involvement in 9-11 and they threw it out of court.
[02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:14.690]  Okay.
[02:55:14.730 --> 02:55:16.771]  You've got him scheduled to come back on though, eh?
[02:55:17.634 --> 02:55:18.935]  Yeah, he's just so busy.
[02:55:19.235 --> 02:55:19.795]  Okay.
[02:55:21.036 --> 02:55:27.359]  Another thing you had a few weeks ago, you were talking about the Oklahoma City bombing case?
[02:55:27.699 --> 02:55:27.999]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:28.799 --> 02:55:32.341]  And have you read the book, Secrets Worth Dying For?
[02:55:32.861 --> 02:55:33.482]  No, I haven't.
[02:55:33.882 --> 02:55:39.645]  Okay, well that's written by two cellmates of Timothy McVeigh.
[02:55:40.445 --> 02:55:44.567]  They were with him for 23 months and supposedly this is the
[02:55:48.991 --> 02:55:57.301]  Well, that meshes with the facts.
[02:55:57.321 --> 02:55:58.742]  Have you seen my film Road to Tyranny?
[02:56:00.484 --> 02:56:00.945]  Well, yes.
[02:56:01.405 --> 02:56:02.647]  Well, 40 minutes of it.
[02:56:02.767 --> 02:56:05.850]  I mean, is the police and others admitting it was a government op?
[02:56:06.111 --> 02:56:06.311]  Right.
[02:56:06.711 --> 02:56:07.652]  I mean, it's proven.
[02:56:07.973 --> 02:56:08.173]  Yeah.
[02:56:09.013 --> 02:56:10.594]  Well, this is quite a book.
[02:56:10.914 --> 02:56:14.276]  I thought I'd photocopy some of it and send it to you.
[02:56:14.716 --> 02:56:15.376]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:56:15.436 --> 02:56:18.157]  I'd like to get the author on as a guest, or the publisher.
[02:56:18.197 --> 02:56:19.818]  Yeah, well, these guys are in prison.
[02:56:19.858 --> 02:56:21.459]  I don't even know if they're alive anymore.
[02:56:21.499 --> 02:56:23.419]  They were both on death row at the time.
[02:56:24.220 --> 02:56:24.760]  Amazing.
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:26.561]  Alright, thank you, sir.
[02:56:27.461 --> 02:56:29.462]  Flat out of time, back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:29.482 --> 02:56:31.023]  Central, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:31.663 --> 02:56:32.583]  God bless you all.
[02:56:32.603 --> 02:56:34.484]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
