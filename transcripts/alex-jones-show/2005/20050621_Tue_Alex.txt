[00:00:06.418 --> 00:00:07.079]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.739 --> 00:00:08.800]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:10.682]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.242 --> 00:00:12.103]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.844 --> 00:00:13.725]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.385 --> 00:00:18.329]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:22.652]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.728]  Another information warfare pact broadcast for you in defense of this constitutional republic, the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights.
[00:00:48.269 --> 00:01:00.400]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, defending the Second Amendment, fighting against abortion, fighting to secure our borders, fighting against the United Nations and the private banks and the Republican Party that controls it.
[00:01:01.232 --> 00:01:03.654]  Fighting against genetically modified foods.
[00:01:04.155 --> 00:01:06.737]  Fighting against out-of-control psychiatry.
[00:01:07.463 --> 00:01:37.083]  That itself is controlled by big pharma pushing drugs that cause massive increases in suicide, fighting against the deadly dangerous vaccines, exposing the face scanning cameras and the biometric control grid going in, resisting the taxation grid, the national and state toll roads, fighting the militarization of police, fighting the New World Order, fighting phony neocons, fighting phony liberals, fighting the New World Order!
[00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:45.309]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:52.174]  Putting my blood, my sweat, my tears, my treasure, everything on the line.
[00:01:52.194 --> 00:01:56.998]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central back from 9 to midnight.
[00:01:58.019 --> 00:02:01.882]  I am the hardest working man in radio and I'm honored to be your host.
[00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:10.639]  All right, my friends, the websites for joining us for the first time are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.net.
[00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.620]  Check them out today, they're all jam-packed.
[00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:31.170]  Joining us for his bi-weekly visit, he normally joins us every two weeks, Paul Joseph Watson, an excellent political analyst, got his head screwed on straight as an arrow, will be joining us for the second and third hours today for a massive news blitz and your phone calls.
[00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:36.882]  In the meantime, forget credit cards or checks, pay with your fingerprint!
[00:02:37.622 --> 00:02:41.943]  This out of KSDK television out of Missouri.
[00:02:42.743 --> 00:02:46.184]  Ah, the thumb scanners going into buy and sell at the mini-marts.
[00:02:46.984 --> 00:02:50.344]  Mexican drug commandos expand operations into six U.S.
[00:02:50.364 --> 00:02:50.805]  states.
[00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:54.385]  I knew they were in five states, but now they're in six states.
[00:02:54.605 --> 00:02:55.185]  Oh boy!
[00:02:55.626 --> 00:02:57.266]  And they work for the CIA!
[00:02:59.341 --> 00:03:00.262]  Trust in U.S.
[00:03:00.302 --> 00:03:04.805]  Representatives down to 17 percent, Bush down to 27 percent.
[00:03:05.725 --> 00:03:07.166]  Be afraid, be very afraid.
[00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.888]  They may have to punch us and tell us terrorists did it.
[00:03:10.228 --> 00:03:14.992]  So we'll crawl under their arms, under their black wings, so they can take good care of us.
[00:03:16.112 --> 00:03:17.453]  A general is now saying the U.S.
[00:03:17.513 --> 00:03:21.096]  is likely to begin withdrawal of forces in Iraq by next year.
[00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:41.715]  And if you believe that I got a bridge I want to sell here some oceanfront property in Arizona and from my front porch you can see the sea I got some oceanfront property in Arizona and if you'll buy that I'll throw the golden gate
[00:03:41.735 --> 00:03:45.396]  Okay, I'm fired up, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:45.716 --> 00:03:49.198]  I think the burnout point was last week, doing all those interviews, my own radio show.
[00:04:07.404 --> 00:04:14.247]  Showing my film, giving a speech, uh, you know, shaking hands for a couple hours, and then doing a marathon interview.
[00:04:15.207 --> 00:04:16.928]  On coast to coast, I was exhausted.
[00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:18.648]  So I've been sleeping a lot.
[00:04:18.668 --> 00:04:21.889]  I've been getting like eight, nine hours sleep a night the last three or four nights.
[00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.910]  And man, I just feel good!
[00:04:25.071 --> 00:04:27.471]  I feel fired up, so look out!
[00:04:28.532 --> 00:04:32.793]  Look out, you're gonna hear me butchering more George Strait songs!
[00:04:33.454 --> 00:04:34.214]  Alright, folks.
[00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.255]  Oh boy.
[00:04:36.335 --> 00:04:37.956]  Is the worst yet to come in Iraq?
[00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:44.218]  Senior Bush official says insurgents likely to step up attacks as terrorists try to derail constitutional elections.
[00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:46.158]  Shaibo burial provokes new fight.
[00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.900]  Data on I-95 customers stops sought with checkpoints.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.981]  Police plead to keep more suspects' DNA.
[00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:57.522]  FBI trolls libraries for terrorist readers.
[00:04:58.862 --> 00:05:00.003]  There's so much coming up.
[00:05:00.023 --> 00:05:00.423]  Stay with us.
[00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:05.990]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.810]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:08.171 --> 00:05:12.832]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:13.172 --> 00:05:17.614]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:18.034 --> 00:05:22.195]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:22.435 --> 00:05:25.256]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:25.356 --> 00:05:30.017]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:30.218 --> 00:05:34.619]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.859 --> 00:05:42.101]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.762]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:05.695]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:06.035 --> 00:06:14.865]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:15.185 --> 00:06:19.871]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:27.053]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:27.433 --> 00:06:39.237]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:39.697 --> 00:06:44.160]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:07:01.696 --> 00:07:05.058]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:05.318 --> 00:07:05.638]  Why?
[00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:08.599]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:07.174]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.834 --> 00:08:08.914]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:10.715]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.375 --> 00:08:12.195]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.935 --> 00:08:14.456]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.516 --> 00:08:18.157]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:22.818]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.998 --> 00:08:32.121]  English neocons call me a liberal.
[00:08:34.089 --> 00:08:39.170]  Dumb, down, misdirected liberals call me an extreme right winger.
[00:08:42.173 --> 00:08:43.654]  People need labels.
[00:08:43.754 --> 00:08:44.935]  They need a handle.
[00:08:45.015 --> 00:08:48.037]  Well, let me just boil it down for you if you're joining us for the first time.
[00:08:48.437 --> 00:08:49.258]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:08:49.418 --> 00:08:50.098]  I love liberty.
[00:08:50.258 --> 00:08:50.959]  I love freedom.
[00:08:51.379 --> 00:08:53.641]  I believe you should control your own destiny.
[00:08:54.141 --> 00:08:56.503]  I believe this country should control its own destiny.
[00:08:56.803 --> 00:08:58.524]  I believe we should control our borders.
[00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:00.525]  I'm against murdering children.
[00:09:00.545 --> 00:09:01.546]  I'm against abortion.
[00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:03.367]  I'm against a national draft.
[00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:09.311]  I'm against genetically engineered foods that are completely deadly, not just for the human body, but for the environment.
[00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:15.510]  I am against the United Nations created by the large central banks that destroy our sovereignty.
[00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.574]  I am against this criminal war against Iraq based on a fraud.
[00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:28.579]  I am concerned about government-sponsored terrorism as a pretext to drive the population into slavery.
[00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.561]  I love the Bill of Rights.
[00:09:31.101 --> 00:09:33.503]  I love the Declaration of Independence.
[00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:35.244]  I revel in its beauty.
[00:09:37.444 --> 00:09:43.990]  I understand we've been given false political terms, like a computer given false data, or a virus.
[00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:49.915]  And we're here to debug the mainframe of the group political spectrum.
[00:09:50.595 --> 00:09:51.696]  The group consciousness.
[00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.399]  I know human history.
[00:09:54.499 --> 00:09:55.119]  I've studied it.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:03.046]  I understand that power corrupts or tends to corrupt, and absolute power always corrupts absolutely, as Lord Acton said.
[00:10:04.286 --> 00:10:05.427]  All right, your calls are coming up.
[00:10:05.447 --> 00:10:09.049]  Paul Watson's joining us in the next hour for News Analysis Blitz.
[00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.373]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:16.354 --> 00:10:19.015]  Coming up, thumb scanners going in everywhere to buy and sell.
[00:10:19.536 --> 00:10:24.859]  Mexican drug commandos slaughtering even more people, spreading into six states, working for the CIA.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.640]  Trust in U.S.
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.842]  representatives down to 17%, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:31.083]  That's an all-time record.
[00:10:32.839 --> 00:10:35.981]  The top generals saying that they're going to start the pullout next year.
[00:10:36.081 --> 00:10:36.902]  I don't believe that.
[00:10:38.182 --> 00:10:40.044]  And is the worst yet to come.
[00:10:40.124 --> 00:10:44.286]  Internal analysis by the CIA says things are really deteriorating quickly.
[00:10:44.586 --> 00:10:46.888]  The latest developments with the Terry Schiavo case.
[00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:53.012]  Just a plethora of other news across the political spectrum.
[00:10:53.052 --> 00:10:59.416]  But I spent five minutes on this yesterday and I should have spent about 30 minutes on it.
[00:10:59.436 --> 00:11:01.137]  So we're going to spend some time on it now.
[00:11:02.714 --> 00:11:06.456]  And then we're going to go to your calls and get into all the other news I've mentioned and a lot more we haven't mentioned.
[00:11:07.597 --> 00:11:19.223]  First off, George Bush has given us a $2.6 trillion dollar budget with $600 billion off-budget, that is $3.2 trillion grand budget for 2006.
[00:11:21.344 --> 00:11:22.964]  They passed the 06 budget in 05.
[00:11:24.925 --> 00:11:27.807]  We have a $2.3 trillion dollar budget this year.
[00:11:28.723 --> 00:11:32.785]  Bill Clinton's biggest budget, counting on-budget and off-budget, was $1.8 trillion.
[00:11:34.086 --> 00:11:37.068]  And the lion's share of that is not extra military expenditures.
[00:11:38.148 --> 00:11:40.589]  No, it is expanding the BATF.
[00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:42.771]  That's right, to buffer your guns.
[00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:49.554]  It is expanding UNESCO, United Nations Control of our Regulatory Systems, and education, you name it.
[00:11:50.755 --> 00:11:53.296]  It is expanding the Department of Education.
[00:11:53.516 --> 00:11:58.299]  Just every federal agency you can imagine massively being bloated and increased in size.
[00:11:59.022 --> 00:12:04.464]  And out-Clinton-ing every Clinton policy you can imagine, because it isn't a Clinton policy, it's a globalist policy.
[00:12:05.184 --> 00:12:19.630]  Bill Clinton, of course, at Hillary's meeting with Rupert Murdoch, forming an alliance, New York Observer, Clinton is a surrogate member of the family, and Barbara Bush calls him their son, so... Please, folks, there is no difference, it's totally staged.
[00:12:21.411 --> 00:12:27.053]  So all of that said, Rush Limbaugh's job is to point out the absurdity of the left,
[00:12:28.559 --> 00:12:53.324]  His job is to launch false attacks on the left, they're not substantive, thinking people then check out the attacks, find out most of them are not true, or are twisted, and then think, oh, leftism or corporate socialism to consolidate funds for the corporate cronies must be good, driving people into the false solution of the left.
[00:12:54.048 --> 00:13:00.770]  Who predominantly vote for the wars and the forced psychological testing and the vaccines and the open borders and all the things.
[00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:04.851]  Limbaugh's job is to cover up Bush's real record.
[00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:14.253]  Because Limbaugh is on an hour after my show ends, a lot of days I'll listen to Jack Blood or I'll listen to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:13:15.834 --> 00:13:16.894]  I kind of trade off.
[00:13:18.034 --> 00:13:21.555]  But I tend to more often listen to Limbaugh because I have to hear what enemy transmissions are up to.
[00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.771]  And it's truly nauseous.
[00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:27.771]  Truly nauseous.
[00:13:30.032 --> 00:13:31.592]  I mean, this is what Limbaugh will do.
[00:13:32.052 --> 00:13:37.133]  And a lot of times on the weekend I listen, because the local station re-airs him on Saturday and Sundays for three hours each day.
[00:13:37.153 --> 00:13:44.555]  And I'll be in the yard, or cleaning the garage out, or driving to the grocery store, walking around the grocery store with a Walkman on, listening to it.
[00:13:45.055 --> 00:13:47.476]  Becoming angry, but it actually gives me energy to fight them.
[00:13:48.436 --> 00:13:49.516]  And this is an average lie.
[00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:54.754]  Now, his new outrage dwarfs all previous outrages, but we'll get into it.
[00:13:55.454 --> 00:13:56.155]  Here's an example.
[00:13:56.495 --> 00:13:59.978]  Why, George Washington Carver, he genetically engineered food.
[00:13:59.998 --> 00:14:05.442]  He genetically engineered crops, and look at everything we each genetically engineer.
[00:14:05.782 --> 00:14:09.405]  Why, the stuff they're doing now is completely wholesome and good, and it's all liberal lies!
[00:14:09.845 --> 00:14:13.288]  Why, remember the stuff they sprayed on apples, claiming that was bad?
[00:14:13.308 --> 00:14:14.569]  Well, it turned out that was good!
[00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:16.851]  Nothing to do with genetic engineering.
[00:14:18.816 --> 00:14:24.961]  When what George Washington Carver did was cross-pollinization, something that naturally happens, he would just accelerate it.
[00:14:26.082 --> 00:14:35.510]  Taking two or three species of peanut and crossing them and finding and testing and finding out which one took limited water and which one tasted better and had a bigger peanut fruit.
[00:14:36.911 --> 00:14:40.574]  Bigger peanut nut, more meat in the nut.
[00:14:41.394 --> 00:14:44.577]  That's not genetic engineering in the classical sense.
[00:14:46.971 --> 00:14:54.418]  Breeding dogs is not... No, no, you're not changing the base species, you're just manipulating the current genetic structure.
[00:14:55.259 --> 00:15:11.893]  What's going on today is taking a whole gene or group of genes and removing that gene and adding a salmon gene, or a cockroach gene, or a grasshopper gene, or adding a human gene to pork, or adding spider genes to goats, changing whole organs.
[00:15:13.436 --> 00:15:24.048]  And then it gives rise to all sorts of mutations and problems and new proteins, and when you eat that, your body does not know how to absorb it, and it just doesn't give you bad nutrition, it actually hurts you!
[00:15:24.989 --> 00:15:31.717]  And we've had top scientists on who worked for the big companies, who were pro-genetic engineering, fathers of it, literally!
[00:15:32.697 --> 00:15:33.878]  They'll tell you how deadly it is.
[00:15:34.198 --> 00:15:35.939]  Monsanto's own internal reports.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:44.466]  But no, when Limbaugh's done with it, it's just crossing a potato, or it's crossing a peanut.
[00:15:45.947 --> 00:15:47.908]  That is not what we're talking about, folks.
[00:15:48.489 --> 00:15:49.410]  So here's the example.
[00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:59.257]  Classical breeding, and that's all it is, hybrid breeding, is crossing two peanuts, or crossing a German Shepherd with a Dalmatian.
[00:16:00.766 --> 00:16:01.126]  Okay?
[00:16:01.667 --> 00:16:04.748]  Or, what is a Boston Terrier?
[00:16:04.828 --> 00:16:07.790]  It's a mix of several bulldogs and a terrier.
[00:16:09.451 --> 00:16:11.052]  That is still the same species.
[00:16:11.552 --> 00:16:14.174]  That's like mixing a white man with a black woman.
[00:16:14.254 --> 00:16:15.334]  It's still a human being.
[00:16:15.855 --> 00:16:23.099]  But if you mix a white man with a goat, which they can do genetically now, that is something completely different!
[00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:26.441]  It's transgenetic, trans-species!
[00:16:28.829 --> 00:16:36.174]  So Limbaugh confuses a black man having sex with a white woman and having a baby with a goat being part spider.
[00:16:36.414 --> 00:16:37.274]  That's what he does.
[00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:39.896]  And it is completely different.
[00:16:39.936 --> 00:16:45.760]  A goat and a spider is different than a Native American with an African woman.
[00:16:47.701 --> 00:16:53.845]  An Asian, that's what a Native American is, an Asian with an African or a Negroid.
[00:16:56.207 --> 00:16:58.749]  Or a Anglo with a Negroid.
[00:16:59.109 --> 00:17:00.591]  And again, people are so dumbed down.
[00:17:00.631 --> 00:17:02.772]  That term, that scientific term.
[00:17:03.153 --> 00:17:05.275]  You're arrested in England if you say the word homosexual.
[00:17:05.335 --> 00:17:06.375]  Seriously, BBC.
[00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:07.877]  Because people think that word's bad.
[00:17:07.917 --> 00:17:11.460]  No, these are scientific words in textbooks.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.962]  But with this dumbed down population, they know
[00:17:14.722 --> 00:17:23.104]  The average person can't find Iraq on a map, can't tell you the state capital, say, of Ohio, or even their own state in many cases.
[00:17:23.685 --> 00:17:28.906]  Most high school seniors can't tell you over half who the vice president is.
[00:17:29.846 --> 00:17:33.447]  So, I mean, you know, they just hear that, oh, the genetic engineering is no big deal.
[00:17:36.228 --> 00:17:39.749]  So taking a, say, a caucasoid,
[00:17:41.568 --> 00:17:49.312]  And mixing it with a pig, that is different than taking an Asian and mixing that Asian with a black.
[00:17:50.933 --> 00:17:52.134]  Totally different!
[00:17:53.935 --> 00:17:56.537]  Okay, now I've just spent five, six minutes on this one subject.
[00:17:57.857 --> 00:18:07.763]  That's the type of deception that we have out of Limbaugh, who will not tell you about Bush being for open borders, who will not tell you about Bush being for gun control, who will not talk about gigantic budgets.
[00:18:10.177 --> 00:18:14.399]  He just will not do it, and he fools all these good conservative people.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.500]  And so we have the latest outrage.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.123]  But before we get into Limbaugh selling Gitmo gear and how... First, let's play this clip from a year ago.
[00:18:23.163 --> 00:18:27.765]  There's other clips I've heard and that never got to my producer that are far worse than this, searching around online.
[00:18:27.805 --> 00:18:28.326]  You can find them.
[00:18:28.826 --> 00:18:36.509]  But here he is talking about the stuff going on at Abu Ghraib where people have been beaten to death and raped and tortured.
[00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.750]  Army's own report.
[00:18:39.252 --> 00:18:40.733]  Here, this is what he had to say about that.
[00:18:40.773 --> 00:18:41.374]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:18:42.755 --> 00:18:44.356]  Psychologically wrong with that.
[00:18:44.796 --> 00:18:45.897]  It's not the act so much.
[00:18:45.917 --> 00:18:51.941]  It was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked... Exactly!
[00:18:52.602 --> 00:18:54.283]  Exactly my point!
[00:18:54.603 --> 00:19:05.451]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives over it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we're going to really hammer them because they had a good time.
[00:19:07.273 --> 00:19:07.513]  You know,
[00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:10.650]  These people are being fired at every day.
[00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:12.151]  I'm talking about the people having a good time.
[00:19:12.471 --> 00:19:14.951]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[00:19:16.012 --> 00:19:17.952]  You ever heard of needing to blow some steam off?
[00:19:19.872 --> 00:19:25.974]  Yeah, when our troops get captured and tortured to death, I mean, are you going to say the Iraqis are blowing off some steam, having a good time?
[00:19:26.894 --> 00:19:32.675]  So... So we've written an article about this, but mainly focusing on the new outrage
[00:19:34.002 --> 00:19:36.423]  Rush Limbaugh plumbs new depths of perversion.
[00:19:36.903 --> 00:19:39.264]  That's right, perversion just isn't sexual, folks.
[00:19:39.304 --> 00:19:41.685]  Perversion is genetic engineering.
[00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:43.445]  Perversion is torture.
[00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:45.986]  Those are the highest forms of perversion.
[00:19:47.446 --> 00:19:50.848]  And, uh, so we're going to play this ad he runs for these t-shirts.
[00:19:52.648 --> 00:19:56.790]  Which is just depraved beyond belief.
[00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:58.090]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.063 --> 00:20:08.265]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:20:08.725 --> 00:20:16.507]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:20:16.847 --> 00:20:24.689]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:20:25.009 --> 00:20:29.772]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:20:30.112 --> 00:20:34.815]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:20:35.316 --> 00:20:39.178]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:20:39.678 --> 00:20:40.699]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:20:40.759 --> 00:20:44.842]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:20:45.282 --> 00:20:49.665]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.687]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:20:53.147 --> 00:20:54.810]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:55.170]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:02.114 --> 00:21:11.201]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:21:11.442 --> 00:21:22.671]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:23.011 --> 00:21:27.835]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:21:28.055 --> 00:21:28.755]  Are no problem.
[00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:35.599]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:35.839 --> 00:21:42.643]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:42.923 --> 00:21:44.684]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[00:21:44.964 --> 00:21:47.025]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[00:21:47.225 --> 00:21:48.946]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[00:21:49.106 --> 00:21:49.806]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[00:21:53.408 --> 00:21:59.310]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:07.373]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:22:08.634 --> 00:22:12.715]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:20.458]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:30.122]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[00:22:30.762 --> 00:22:35.843]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:36.363 --> 00:22:36.843]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:36.863 --> 00:22:37.164]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:45.449 --> 00:22:47.631]  516-8736.
[00:22:48.692 --> 00:22:49.672]  Just call today.
[00:22:49.772 --> 00:22:52.795]  Our operators are standing by to take your subscription.
[00:22:52.855 --> 00:22:54.196]  It's absolutely free.
[00:23:01.326 --> 00:23:08.231]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:23:08.752 --> 00:23:14.176]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X nail gel.
[00:23:14.576 --> 00:23:24.584]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:23:24.724 --> 00:23:27.085]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:23:27.445 --> 00:23:30.526]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:23:30.626 --> 00:23:32.147]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:23:32.267 --> 00:23:39.750]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:41.731]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:23:42.091 --> 00:23:53.776]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[00:23:55.217 --> 00:24:18.031]  You know, I don't make it my business to bash Bill O'Reilly or to bash Peter Jennings.
[00:24:18.631 --> 00:24:21.373]  We know they're establishment pimps.
[00:24:21.673 --> 00:24:23.674]  I focus on the news, the information, but
[00:24:24.286 --> 00:24:31.589]  When people like Rush Limbaugh, who's got 20 million listeners, instead of 2 million like O'Reilly, I mean, he's the biggest thing in this country, folks.
[00:24:31.629 --> 00:24:37.331]  He's the only old media left, other than people like George Norrie, with the second biggest audience in the country.
[00:24:37.351 --> 00:24:38.411]  You know, 14 million an hour.
[00:24:39.111 --> 00:24:40.092]  And George is a great guy.
[00:24:40.112 --> 00:24:41.412]  He lets the truth come out.
[00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:43.053]  He lets real discussions happen.
[00:24:43.773 --> 00:24:45.654]  Limbaugh is completely different.
[00:24:45.714 --> 00:24:51.856]  And Limbaugh has to be dealt with, he and Savage, with, I don't know, 6 million listeners an hour, have to be dealt with
[00:24:52.754 --> 00:24:56.516]  Because, you know, I mean, Savage put everybody who disagrees with the government in a camp.
[00:24:56.636 --> 00:24:57.256]  You've all heard it.
[00:24:57.796 --> 00:24:58.897]  Every time I tune in, I hear it.
[00:24:58.917 --> 00:24:59.577]  I mean, I'm not kidding.
[00:25:00.498 --> 00:25:02.219]  I might tune in once a month and I hear it.
[00:25:02.479 --> 00:25:05.460]  He must just constantly repeat the same thing over and over again.
[00:25:06.561 --> 00:25:09.902]  Because when this idea gets introduced, folks, we're all in danger.
[00:25:10.463 --> 00:25:12.143]  Don't think for a second it's for Muslims.
[00:25:12.183 --> 00:25:15.345]  I've got the FBI training manuals, video of them, all of it.
[00:25:15.925 --> 00:25:18.326]  It's in Road to Jeremy, where they're admitting it's for the American people.
[00:25:18.606 --> 00:25:19.467]  It's for Christians.
[00:25:20.345 --> 00:25:24.068]  And they're selling poor Christians on this for the Muslims, and it's for everybody.
[00:25:25.589 --> 00:25:34.875]  And so Sunday, we're in there cooking lunch, sitting in the kitchen with my wife, we've got local KLBJ on, and I'm listening to Limbaugh, and he's talking about how great camps are.
[00:25:35.996 --> 00:25:46.723]  And he's talking about how wonderful it is, and how Gitmo's a wonderful place, and how they're basically all guilty, and how they all deserve it, and buy my t-shirt, you know, about how it's a great vacation spot.
[00:25:49.688 --> 00:26:08.161]  I mean, here I am having the Army's own reports, and how its families picked up at checkpoints, and the number one CIA man over Afghanistan in the Afghan war admits, yeah, the real Taliban would just go grab goat herders out of the hills, and would arrest them, and we'd pay them $25,000, $3,000, $25,000 a piece for innocent people.
[00:26:15.023 --> 00:26:16.424]  That's who's at Camp X-Ray.
[00:26:16.684 --> 00:26:23.167]  I mean, it's literally just a theater to train us that torture's good, to train the military that torture's good.
[00:26:23.387 --> 00:26:29.550]  They're now even expanding it with hundreds of more beds, and to make the world think they're doing something.
[00:26:30.631 --> 00:26:35.493]  I mean, I have links in this article Paul Watson put together that are linked to all the admissions.
[00:26:37.534 --> 00:26:40.176]  So, it's so scary.
[00:26:41.136 --> 00:26:44.518]  And then, I'm sitting here listening to him saying how great it is.
[00:26:46.115 --> 00:26:51.178]  So go ahead and play this ad, and I guess we're going to make Limbaugh some money here, you ought to thank us.
[00:26:51.218 --> 00:26:56.401]  Now we've got a right to expose this type of garbage, so we're going to analyze this ad.
[00:26:56.441 --> 00:26:59.023]  Go ahead and roll this disgusting propaganda.
[00:26:59.543 --> 00:27:03.225]  It's the jewel of the Caribbean, but it's not for everybody.
[00:27:03.265 --> 00:27:04.706]  Hitmo the Muslim Resort.
[00:27:04.866 --> 00:27:08.168]  It's a luxury resort just for terrorist wannabes.
[00:27:08.208 --> 00:27:09.469]  Come down and visit for some R&R.
[00:27:10.229 --> 00:27:11.732]  For some rest and relaxation.
[00:27:11.972 --> 00:27:13.775]  It's paradise on earth.
[00:27:13.815 --> 00:27:18.282]  Diet, Qurans, prayer, rugs, anywhere else can Muslims go in the world to find everything they need.
[00:27:18.362 --> 00:27:21.647]  Truly a deluxe vacation spot for true believers everywhere.
[00:27:21.747 --> 00:27:22.769]  There's no better place.
[00:27:23.465 --> 00:27:24.346]  Then Gitmo.
[00:27:24.506 --> 00:27:26.387]  Club Gitmo, the Muslim resort.
[00:27:26.527 --> 00:27:27.248]  Club Gitmo.
[00:27:27.288 --> 00:27:29.249]  There is nothing in the world quite like it.
[00:27:29.289 --> 00:27:32.631]  It's a one-of-a-kind resort on the west coast of Cuba, overlooking the bay.
[00:27:33.072 --> 00:27:41.798]  Every visitor, every check-in at no charge gets a new Koran, a new prayer rug, Muslim chefs, Muslim dietary laws, five prayer sessions a day.
[00:27:41.898 --> 00:27:42.658]  Club Gitmo.
[00:27:42.738 --> 00:27:44.059]  Reserve your spot today.
[00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.561]  Club Gitmo has been endorsed by Amnesty International.
[00:27:46.601 --> 00:27:52.505]  It's a tropical paradise down there where Muslim extremists and terrorist wannabes can get together for rest and relaxation.
[00:27:52.585 --> 00:27:54.770]  Remember, Muslim extremists everywhere!
[00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:58.418]  At Club Gitmo, we have a spot reserved for you!
[00:27:58.438 --> 00:28:02.728]  Now, and the excuse here will be, well...
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.742]  You know, this is a parody, and we're illustrating absurdity by being absurd.
[00:28:07.782 --> 00:28:11.883]  No, he time and time again says it's wonderful, says it's great, says it's all lies.
[00:28:12.504 --> 00:28:15.985]  Now his new thing is, if we're attacked again, it's all the evil liberals' fault.
[00:28:16.325 --> 00:28:17.626]  You're going to make us be attacked.
[00:28:17.686 --> 00:28:20.287]  No, Bush has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:28:20.867 --> 00:28:22.428]  Bush is funding the terrorist groups.
[00:28:22.748 --> 00:28:32.792]  But I told you, when the globalists carry out another terror attack, it's going to be everybody's fault who was against the Patriot Act, everybody that didn't capitulate, and go along with the national draft, and go along with invading all these countries.
[00:28:35.183 --> 00:28:37.545]  And this is in the P-2-O-G documents from the Pentagon.
[00:28:37.585 --> 00:28:39.186]  This is meant to enrage Muslims.
[00:28:39.226 --> 00:28:41.308]  Notice they keep saying, Muslim paradise.
[00:28:41.768 --> 00:28:43.150]  Muslim, Muslim, Muslim.
[00:28:44.811 --> 00:28:51.456]  You know, most of those countries over there in the Middle East are controlled by our government, have puppet dictators in over them, and the people are under their control.
[00:28:52.437 --> 00:28:55.500]  But again, this demonization... A little Freudian slip, though.
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.161]  Terrorist wannabes.
[00:28:57.181 --> 00:28:58.722]  You know, there's no real terrorists there.
[00:28:59.443 --> 00:29:01.905]  Real terrorists are CIA and get flown out to safety.
[00:29:02.651 --> 00:29:07.734]  So we have this detailed article at PrisonPlanet.com and on InfoWars.com.
[00:29:07.774 --> 00:29:09.675]  I even added some comments to it yesterday.
[00:29:11.396 --> 00:29:14.077]  And we've got the facts of what's going on here.
[00:29:14.097 --> 00:29:15.618]  You know, I'm sick of Rush Limbaugh.
[00:29:15.638 --> 00:29:23.202]  I've heard him so many times over the years say that anybody using drugs, illegal drugs, should be put in jail.
[00:29:23.943 --> 00:29:25.343]  And how great the drug laws are.
[00:29:25.363 --> 00:29:26.404]  You know, zero tolerance.
[00:29:28.185 --> 00:29:32.087]  You know, 40 years in prison for a 16-year-old the first time they're caught with cocaine.
[00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:41.570]  And here he is taking hillbilly heroin, 100 pills a day, something that will kill a horse, and oh boy, let's protect his rights!
[00:29:42.791 --> 00:29:48.353]  Put that socialist windbag in prison!
[00:29:49.374 --> 00:29:50.054]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:52.456 --> 00:29:55.457]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.377 --> 00:29:59.079]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:42.335 --> 00:30:43.275]  There is an alternative.

[00:31:03.879 --> 00:31:14.584]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.964 --> 00:31:19.486]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.546 --> 00:31:30.891]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.471 --> 00:31:38.341]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.742 --> 00:31:40.865]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:46.333]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:31:53.580 --> 00:31:57.184]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:57.424 --> 00:31:58.165]  That's toll free.
[00:31:58.185 --> 00:31:58.225]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.009 --> 00:32:03.690]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:05.892]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:32:06.092 --> 00:32:06.772]  Prepare yourself.
[00:32:06.952 --> 00:32:10.675]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:32:10.795 --> 00:32:16.538]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book, The Bible Says, for free.
[00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:17.979]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:32:18.139 --> 00:32:20.741]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:32:20.901 --> 00:32:22.462]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.

[00:32:25.604 --> 00:32:26.345]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:32:31.628 --> 00:32:35.209]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[00:32:35.409 --> 00:32:39.310]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.971]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[00:32:43.351 --> 00:32:50.933]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[00:32:51.213 --> 00:32:54.493]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[00:32:54.914 --> 00:32:58.554]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[00:32:58.814 --> 00:33:00.635]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[00:33:08.188 --> 00:33:09.889]  The polls are coming up here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:11.971]  On this Tuesday, the 21st day of June, 2005, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:11.991 --> 00:33:17.835]  But instead of diatribing and babbling off the top of my head about Limbaugh, let me just go over this article that Paul Watson and I wrote together.
[00:33:32.774 --> 00:33:44.882]  Rush Limbaugh plumbs new depth of perversion, releases Gitmo t-shirt line, oxy-cotton quaffing, bush worshipping, torture apologist Rush Limbaugh has plumbed a new low in both sickness and inaccuracy.
[00:33:45.463 --> 00:33:52.027]  Limbaugh has been hawking a new line of caps, t-shirts, and mugs that depict the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba as a holiday home.
[00:33:53.388 --> 00:33:54.769]  The t-shirt above reads,
[00:33:55.956 --> 00:34:02.099]  Your tropical retreat from the stress of Jihad and other reads, I got my free Quran and prayer rug at Gitmo.
[00:34:02.139 --> 00:34:04.560]  Remember, these are people who are guilty until proven innocent.
[00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.521]  He's just saying they're guilty.
[00:34:06.121 --> 00:34:10.363]  And another, my mullah went to Club Gitmo and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.
[00:34:11.083 --> 00:34:15.525]  Again, the CIA officer told the Associated Press, high level, that yeah, it's true.
[00:34:16.966 --> 00:34:21.208]  Mainly the Taliban, who they were ordered to leave alone, would just round up villagers and come sell them
[00:34:21.897 --> 00:34:24.139]  They get $3,000 for a 12-year-old.
[00:34:24.159 --> 00:34:27.361]  For somebody who might have really been a fighter, they get $25,000.
[00:34:27.922 --> 00:34:36.408]  And these are hill people who they would invite down with a roasted goat or cow.
[00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:37.929]  They would invite them down.
[00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:41.692]  They'd come down out of the hills and they'd just arrest them and put them on these C-130s.
[00:34:41.812 --> 00:34:45.435]  I mean, these people can't even find America on a map.
[00:34:45.535 --> 00:34:46.156]  I'm sorry.
[00:34:46.876 --> 00:34:47.497]  I'm digressing.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:50.701]  It's just so evil, folks.
[00:34:50.781 --> 00:34:51.322]  So evil.
[00:34:51.682 --> 00:34:55.204]  The t-shirt above reads, your tropical retreat from the stress of Jihad.
[00:34:55.264 --> 00:34:58.526]  Another reads, I got my free Quran and prayer rug at Gitmo.
[00:34:58.546 --> 00:35:01.868]  Another reads, my moolah went to Club Gitmo.
[00:35:01.928 --> 00:35:03.469]  All I got was this lousy t-shirt.
[00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:16.677]  Limbaugh has been promoting the products on his radio show in an attempt to bolster the Bush administration's recent assertions that Camp X-Ray really is a nice place to stay in the face of its critics calling for the camp's closure.
[00:35:17.429 --> 00:35:24.692]  Recall this is the same Limbaugh who last year said that Abu Ghraib prison guards were, quote, just having a good time or blowing off some steam.
[00:35:26.152 --> 00:35:32.775]  The official army report into Abu Ghraib lists the activities that Limbaugh defines as harmless fun.
[00:35:32.795 --> 00:35:41.758]  They include breaking chemical lights and pouring phosphoric liquid on detainees, that's acid, sodomizing a detainee with a chemical light.
[00:35:41.778 --> 00:35:43.179]  Again, we can't read all of this.
[00:35:44.747 --> 00:35:56.753]  Positioning a naked detainee on an MRE box with a sandbag on his head, and attaching wires to his fingers, toes, and genitalia to stimulate, uh, electronic torture.
[00:35:57.394 --> 00:35:58.414]  Raping children.
[00:35:59.135 --> 00:36:00.335]  These were all linked to the report.
[00:36:01.016 --> 00:36:03.697]  A male MP guard raping a female detainee.
[00:36:04.137 --> 00:36:07.259]  Beating detainees to death, and evidence shows harvesting their organs.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.961]  Oh, body snatcher stuff.
[00:36:11.824 --> 00:36:14.306]  All of the above are great ways to relax, according to Rush Limbaugh.
[00:36:14.366 --> 00:36:17.389]  Raping children, beating people to death is harmless fraternity fun.
[00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:28.738]  We know that every investigation, government disclosure, prisoner testimony, and whistleblower testimony, that exactly the same and even worse procedures are taking place at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:36:29.639 --> 00:36:33.562]  The Abu Ghraib torture policy was the same one being used previously at Gitmo.
[00:36:33.902 --> 00:36:39.607]  The policy was called Copper Green, and it was masterminded by Donald Rumsfeld from Vietnam Torture Manuals.
[00:36:41.061 --> 00:36:43.524]  Does it sound like a summer holiday camp to you?
[00:36:44.746 --> 00:36:50.973]  Numerous different detainees have, upon release, confirmed that torture is taking place and that people are routinely beaten to death.
[00:36:51.514 --> 00:36:54.137]  Oh, but of course, those dirty terrorists would say that.
[00:36:54.498 --> 00:36:55.479]  They hate America.
[00:36:55.539 --> 00:36:58.503]  They trained to lie, says Rumsfeld, by Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:59.341 --> 00:37:01.041]  The truth is that, as an L.A.
[00:37:01.061 --> 00:37:05.922]  Times reported two and a half years ago, no leaders of Al-Qaeda were identified as being at Guantanamo.
[00:37:06.262 --> 00:37:07.022]  That's because the U.S.
[00:37:07.062 --> 00:37:14.844]  government ordered all the poor cavemen who were shoved onto the front lines of the Taliban to be arrested while they were safely evacuated.
[00:37:14.864 --> 00:37:22.945]  8,000 Al-Qaeda and Taliban cream by accident, of course, out of Kunduz in Afghanistan to Pakistan.
[00:37:25.045 --> 00:37:27.866]  It's, and it continues, it's the same in Iraq,
[00:37:28.866 --> 00:37:31.007]  I've got an AP article in the photo.
[00:37:31.027 --> 00:37:34.568]  These men were arrested for selling alcohol illegally on the street.
[00:37:51.061 --> 00:37:59.964]  The Guantanamo prisoners were described by the London Guardian as Pakistani and Afghan farmers, shoemakers and taxi drivers who were forced to fight for the Taliban.
[00:38:00.425 --> 00:38:04.826]  Most of these people are Stone Age cave dwellers who don't even know where the USA is on a map.
[00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:13.089]  Jamal al-Harith related how he suffered a brutal attack by US military police because he refused to have a mystery injection.
[00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:20.232]  During the beating, the officers barked in automated unison, comply, comply, comply, do not resist, do not resist.
[00:38:21.002 --> 00:38:25.945]  Other detainees have gone public and said that they were being raped by menstruating prostitutes.
[00:38:27.246 --> 00:38:29.868]  And that's what the Army's own report admits to that.
[00:38:29.888 --> 00:38:38.234]  To get them to talk, they found that it really freaks them out to have heavy metal music playing while women rape them.
[00:38:38.814 --> 00:38:39.955]  Very satanic, folks.
[00:38:40.135 --> 00:38:41.536]  It's all sexual pervertedness.
[00:38:41.596 --> 00:38:42.737]  Satanists are always into this.
[00:38:44.258 --> 00:38:46.219]  And that's the authors of these training manuals.
[00:38:47.159 --> 00:38:51.301]  Suicide attempts are common after it was admitted by the Pentagon that there were five in three weeks.
[00:38:51.801 --> 00:38:52.862]  It's also been a bunch of deaths.
[00:38:52.902 --> 00:38:56.224]  The news media mysteriously shut up and stopped talking about it.
[00:38:56.964 --> 00:39:00.005]  Again, according to Limbaugh, this is no different than a trip to Disneyland.
[00:39:00.446 --> 00:39:07.169]  Being forcibly injected, tortured, raped, and then beaten to death amounts to that quintessential American summer family getaway.
[00:39:08.542 --> 00:39:13.327]  Brigadier General Rick Baucus, former head of the military police at Guantanamo Bay, was fired.
[00:39:13.967 --> 00:39:19.072]  Again, if you read the AP article we linked to, it says he refused and offered his resignation.
[00:39:19.112 --> 00:39:20.013]  They said, you're fired.
[00:39:20.073 --> 00:39:20.914]  So he really resigned.
[00:39:21.555 --> 00:39:28.421]  When he refused to torture the Gitmo detainees, he was lambasted as being too nice because he refused to get the cattle brought out.
[00:39:30.463 --> 00:39:30.984]  That's admitted.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:42.366]  By our esteemed Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, said in his own memos that the Geneva Conventions were obsolete and that, in effect, Bush was above national or international law.
[00:39:43.286 --> 00:39:48.529]  Torture is a new American virtue and the acceptability of its use is clearly spelled out in these memos.
[00:39:48.909 --> 00:39:51.150]  There's no debate as to whether torture is being used.
[00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:58.134]  Yeah, he says we can torture people to death, but if they don't die on purpose, if we don't kill them on purpose, it's not even torture.
[00:39:59.535 --> 00:40:01.397]  He says tabling them is nice.
[00:40:01.457 --> 00:40:02.758]  You ever seen Conspiracy Theory?
[00:40:04.199 --> 00:40:06.240]  Which, uh, they did a lot of research for that movie.
[00:40:06.761 --> 00:40:14.126]  On the CIA, on Copper Green, where they dump Mel Gibson into the pool, on the table, till he starts to drown.
[00:40:15.207 --> 00:40:17.769]  That's what they do, except it's urine and feces.
[00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:19.851]  Oh, that's in Copper Green.
[00:40:20.591 --> 00:40:25.355]  The troops urinate and defecate for several weeks into a giant pit,
[00:40:26.118 --> 00:40:28.899]  And then you're lowered into it up to your shoulders, head first.
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.221]  Now I'm sorry if you don't want to hear this, okay?
[00:40:31.401 --> 00:40:33.202]  There's a lot of this stuff we can't read here.
[00:40:34.222 --> 00:40:38.004]  But this is what Alberto Gonzalez, our Attorney General, says is good.
[00:40:40.365 --> 00:40:42.386]  And it's also quite popular in the police departments.
[00:40:42.426 --> 00:40:45.848]  We have footage of the yogurt shop murders, which they've now proven the men were innocent.
[00:40:45.888 --> 00:40:46.568]  They charged with it.
[00:40:46.828 --> 00:40:48.009]  The DNA, they were innocent.
[00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:52.931]  The cops put guns to their heads and they show it on the news like it's good.
[00:40:52.991 --> 00:40:54.052]  Well, this is just what we do.
[00:40:55.698 --> 00:40:59.360]  They put a bag over your head until you start to suffocate, until you answer questions.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:01.501]  Folks, this could happen to any of us.
[00:41:01.921 --> 00:41:06.163]  They hired people out of federal jails and state prisons to run Abu Ghraib.
[00:41:06.183 --> 00:41:07.063]  Do you understand that?
[00:41:10.705 --> 00:41:15.828]  The detainees are being treated like royalty according to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter.
[00:41:16.228 --> 00:41:23.011]  Last week he staged a photo op where he presented a plate of food to the cameras and used it as an example of how luxurious the conditions were.
[00:41:24.341 --> 00:41:33.507]  The delicious irony of the 2002 hunger strike in which hundreds of detainees, two-thirds of the entire camp, went without food to protest their detention without charge would probably be lost on Hunter.
[00:41:34.688 --> 00:41:48.437]  Limbaugh wraps himself in the flag, actually on his website he's actually wrapped, he has the flag, you've got to see this, to represent the moral fabric of America while promoting t-shirts that make Guantanamo Bay out to be a dream vacation.
[00:41:48.957 --> 00:41:51.319]  Listen to this sickening audio ad we just played earlier.
[00:41:51.952 --> 00:42:01.175]  For the shirts being played on Limbaugh's radio show, the announcer describes Gitmo as a paradise on earth, while Limbaugh rattles on about how Muslims have everything they need.
[00:42:02.076 --> 00:42:08.398]  He even carries daily weather forecasts on his website comparing the temperatures of Gitmo to Baghdad.
[00:42:10.928 --> 00:42:26.663]  And in conclusion, he claims the troops have it harder because of the higher temperatures, bypassing, of course, that they're mostly in air-conditioned green zone, while the terrorist shoemakers and taxi drivers are left out in their plush, deluxe, comfy rat cage pads.
[00:42:26.683 --> 00:42:28.705]  Can you imagine being in Gitmo?
[00:42:29.955 --> 00:42:32.257]  Where they have year-round mosquitos.
[00:42:32.438 --> 00:42:34.300]  For those that don't live in the South of the U.S.
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:35.140]  you don't know what it's like.
[00:42:35.521 --> 00:42:37.303]  We'll get mosquitos even worse.
[00:42:37.723 --> 00:42:38.864]  I've talked to folks that have been there.
[00:42:39.245 --> 00:42:41.727]  Year-round just flotillas of mosquitos.
[00:42:42.348 --> 00:42:52.258]  These men in open cages like Vietnam vets would be held by the Viet Cong and by the VC regulars for years in these open cages.
[00:42:52.378 --> 00:42:53.359]  It is a nightmare.
[00:42:54.290 --> 00:42:56.872]  The reports are, even, there's two camps at Gitmo.
[00:42:56.892 --> 00:43:04.358]  There's the camp where the Red Cross has been allowed in once, and then an internal CIA camp within that's indoors where the real torture goes on.
[00:43:04.398 --> 00:43:20.050]  But imagine outdoors, being there for two and a half, almost three years, with mosquitoes 24 hours a day, just feasting, and feasting, and feasting, and feasting, and feasting, just hour after hour, week after week, bites all over their entire bodies.
[00:43:22.644 --> 00:43:27.328]  The aid workers that have seen them just described them as just a mat of welts and bleeding sores.
[00:43:28.569 --> 00:43:29.570]  No, it's freedom.
[00:43:30.110 --> 00:43:30.891]  Hey, our troops!
[00:43:31.291 --> 00:43:36.056]  Why didn't Limbaugh sell t-shirts about how great the North Vietnamese were with our troops in Vietnam?
[00:43:36.276 --> 00:43:38.558]  How great being in a tropical cage is?
[00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:47.106]  I can't even leave my dogs outside for more than 30 minutes a day right now because there's so many mosquitoes here in Central Texas.
[00:43:48.977 --> 00:43:51.119]  If I don't, they're just bites all over them.
[00:43:51.299 --> 00:43:55.462]  I can't go outside for more than 10 minutes to water my garden because of the stupid mosquitoes.
[00:43:57.864 --> 00:43:59.245]  Again, these are the lies, folks.
[00:43:59.285 --> 00:44:03.188]  They know exactly what they're doing with these cages right on the ground.
[00:44:05.049 --> 00:44:06.390]  And when they release them, they describe it.
[00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:08.332]  The mosquitoes, the snakes, the rats.
[00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.252]  This is the same Rush Limbaugh who advocated locking up every... Let me continue.
[00:44:14.592 --> 00:44:27.058]  He claims that troops have it harder because of the higher temperature, bypassing, of course, that they're mostly in the air-conditioned green zone, while the terrorists, shoemakers and tacky drivers, are left out in their plush and deluxe comfy rat cage pads.
[00:44:28.459 --> 00:44:37.804]  This is the same Rush Limbaugh who advocated locking up everyone, including children that use drugs, while at the same time cramming a hundred OxyContins a day down his disgusting throat.
[00:44:39.016 --> 00:44:50.851]  This is the same Rush Limbaugh who lauds the Patriot Act discussing those who provided examples of it being used against American citizens and at the same breath complains when it's used against Limbaugh himself.
[00:44:50.891 --> 00:44:55.096]  We have a link to where the Patriot Act was used on him to investigate money withdrawals.
[00:44:56.571 --> 00:45:01.253]  As this article picks up, hits all across the web, we see Limbaugh.
[00:45:01.494 --> 00:45:03.875]  People see if Limbaugh has the brass to respond to it.
[00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:09.517]  This is made all the more unlikely by the fact that if Limbaugh ever debated me, I would destroy him.
[00:45:10.178 --> 00:45:19.762]  The truth will always triumph over torture-loving, bush, open-bordered, gun-control-worshipping, oxy-cotton-chomping, neo-con-man like Rush Limbaugh.
[00:45:20.563 --> 00:45:22.044]  Alright, sorry I babbled through that.
[00:45:25.214 --> 00:45:26.435]  That's the truth, folks.
[00:45:26.655 --> 00:45:28.456]  Your government controls Al Qaeda.
[00:45:28.496 --> 00:45:30.658]  Your criminal government flew them out to safety.
[00:45:31.898 --> 00:45:33.980]  Your government flew them out of this country to safety.
[00:45:34.620 --> 00:45:37.722]  Your government's taking all your freedoms and ordering the Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:45:38.543 --> 00:45:47.208]  Your Border Patrol is under attack right now by Los Zectas who are being trained by the CIA at Fort Benning, Georgia and at bases in South Texas.
[00:45:48.529 --> 00:45:50.430]  It's even coming out in the mainstream news now.
[00:45:50.690 --> 00:45:52.011]  I've got articles today on this.
[00:45:52.071 --> 00:45:54.553]  It's even coming out mainstream!
[00:45:58.135 --> 00:45:59.475]  I don't want to hear it anymore!
[00:45:59.595 --> 00:46:01.376]  Stop running defense for Bush!
[00:46:01.456 --> 00:46:02.956]  Stop covering up Limbaugh!
[00:46:02.996 --> 00:46:06.737]  He's a gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting globalist!
[00:46:08.717 --> 00:46:13.098]  And stop sitting there making America look bad, and our troops look bad, and this country look bad!
[00:46:13.118 --> 00:46:26.981]  How do you think it looks in the world when people learn that they're making jokes about Gitmo, and jokes about Abu Ghraib, and the hundred-plus other camps around the world, 32 in Iraq alone!
[00:46:28.684 --> 00:46:32.887]  Our government trained Uzbekistan for the machine gun crowds of people.
[00:46:35.609 --> 00:46:42.674]  Folks, you think you're safe when you've got an Attorney General that says dunk people till they pass out in feces?
[00:46:43.895 --> 00:46:44.856]  You think you're safe?
[00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:46.737]  You think you're safe?
[00:46:46.777 --> 00:46:48.078]  You think any of us are safe?
[00:46:48.538 --> 00:46:50.820]  You think this is going to be restricted just to Muslims?
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:53.902]  If it was just going to be restricted to them, I'd be against it.
[00:46:56.286 --> 00:46:58.527]  What's going to happen to our troops when they get captured?
[00:46:59.407 --> 00:47:00.428]  What are we going to say then?
[00:47:00.448 --> 00:47:04.410]  This is the most shameful garbage I've ever seen.
[00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:05.590]  Ron in New York.
[00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:06.371]  Ron, you're on the air.
[00:47:06.391 --> 00:47:06.751]  Go ahead.
[00:47:06.771 --> 00:47:07.671]  Hi, Alex.
[00:47:07.691 --> 00:47:15.895]  If anyone wants to see what a good example of boarding looks like, they could see that portrayal in a movie called Jacob the Liar with Robin Williams and they'll understand how painful that is.
[00:47:16.135 --> 00:47:17.976]  Well, did you see Conspiracy Theory?
[00:47:18.016 --> 00:47:20.517]  They board Mel Gibson.
[00:47:21.667 --> 00:47:23.648]  I'll tell you what, try out Jacob the Liar.
[00:47:23.668 --> 00:47:28.351]  You'll see what it does, the way it puts the body into trauma when they bring you up just before you finally suffocate to death.
[00:47:28.871 --> 00:47:30.112]  You get a real good idea what it is.
[00:47:30.812 --> 00:47:34.575]  But talking about, you spoke about harvesting body parts.
[00:47:35.135 --> 00:47:45.821]  The AMA is holding its convention, the American Medical Association, and they now recommend that they be allowed to harvest the body parts of people without their consent.
[00:47:46.579 --> 00:47:48.880]  It'll be called the Doctrine of Presumed Consent.
[00:47:49.361 --> 00:48:00.207]  No, I know, and they want, and I've heard talk shows promoting, taking prisoners' organs, not just when the death penalty, but when you die in prison, then there'll be a whole new market there.
[00:48:00.707 --> 00:48:05.750]  Well, in this case, we're not even talking about convicted criminals, we're talking about ordinary people who die.
[00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.492]  Third, local hospitals in Austin were caught stealing eyeballs.
[00:48:08.852 --> 00:48:15.814]  Now, that flies, of course, in the face of 6,000 years of Western human civilization, our traditional and religious beliefs.
[00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:18.195]  All the Abrahamic religions tend to be against that.
[00:48:18.215 --> 00:48:20.875]  Well, before you get into that, Ron, I want your comment on torture.
[00:48:20.895 --> 00:48:22.356]  I just spent 45 minutes on it.
[00:48:22.876 --> 00:48:24.036]  Well, okay.
[00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:25.197]  As long as I can continue on.
[00:48:25.217 --> 00:48:26.777]  My other point, torture degrades.
[00:48:27.077 --> 00:48:30.138]  It degrades the torturer as well as the tortured, because what it does
[00:48:30.903 --> 00:48:45.526]  It takes a country like the United States, which has historically been able to posture itself as above doing those sort of things, and it now puts us in a category where we're in no position to criticize the Soviet Union or a totalitarian state in the world.
[00:48:45.586 --> 00:48:46.346]  Bingo!
[00:48:46.486 --> 00:48:54.768]  And now, all over the world, fascist, communist regimes, all these regimes, are ratcheting up the torture and going, hey, you're doing it!
[00:48:55.208 --> 00:48:58.269]  And we can't criticize them because we're guilty of the same thing.
[00:48:58.949 --> 00:49:11.539]  Now, this is another thing, too, about torture I'm getting sick and tired of, this censorious tactic that's been used, where they'll say, well, we're not as bad as Hitler because Hitler killed them.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:18.645]  If you're going to stand there and split hairs between causing a person an extreme amount of pain to the edge of death, if not death itself, okay?
[00:49:20.246 --> 00:49:25.150]  ...torture or mistreatment to the point of death, then the society has lost its collective mind.
[00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:27.792]  Well, it's like the cop who lost his job in Miami.
[00:49:27.852 --> 00:49:32.576]  The guy wouldn't give a urine sample, he was chained down, so he starts tasering him.
[00:49:32.916 --> 00:49:39.222]  The cops just hear this, and the dramas and sitcoms all promote it, and there's no real terrorists to fight, so they start torturing us!
[00:49:39.582 --> 00:49:41.203]  You know what the greatest promotion of it is?
[00:49:41.483 --> 00:49:45.747]  It's true, it's on the sitcoms, and it's got people like Grush Limbaugh advocating it.
[00:49:46.334 --> 00:49:53.240]  But a society that's lost its soul, like America has lost its soul because its people do not speak out with any significant voice.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.201]  We're bloodthirsty.
[00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:56.202]  We've killed 54 million babies.
[00:49:56.222 --> 00:49:57.523]  Were they with Al-Qaeda?
[00:49:57.543 --> 00:49:58.584]  Were they with Al-Qaeda too?
[00:49:59.045 --> 00:50:02.988]  It's a crawling, slithering society that finds entertainment
[00:50:03.568 --> 00:50:07.270]  In brutal contests, strongman contests, and everything else.
[00:50:07.330 --> 00:50:09.052]  We've become a Romanesque society.
[00:50:09.432 --> 00:50:10.172]  That's what's happened.
[00:50:10.252 --> 00:50:17.837]  We are no different than almost... No, listen, I was in a restaurant with Ted Anderson eating dinner in Minnesota when I went up there a month ago to visit.
[00:50:18.657 --> 00:50:20.078]  And there is strongman.
[00:50:20.098 --> 00:50:23.500]  This is a normal, nice restaurant, you know, with a bar in the middle.
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:29.544]  I'm sitting there eating a pork chop, and there's strongman with people punching each other in the throats and blood spraying.
[00:50:30.559 --> 00:50:33.742]  You know, whatever that ultimate man is, ultimate fighting.
[00:50:34.022 --> 00:50:35.363]  I mean, it's just mainstream now.
[00:50:35.963 --> 00:50:38.165]  Right, because this is how they want to dumb you down.
[00:50:38.205 --> 00:50:42.729]  They're doing to this country what the patricians did to the plebeians in Rome two thousand years ago.
[00:50:42.769 --> 00:50:44.970]  Hey, we're one inch away from the running man.
[00:50:45.271 --> 00:50:46.051]  That's all there is to it.
[00:50:46.071 --> 00:50:50.495]  Alright, Ron, I'm going to let you make your point about, uh, whatever it was you were talking about.
[00:50:51.736 --> 00:50:53.097]  Oh, what was your other point?
[00:50:53.457 --> 00:50:55.238]  About the AMA and harvesting organs.
[00:50:55.278 --> 00:50:56.879]  Well, I mean, everybody's with Al Qaeda.
[00:50:56.899 --> 00:50:58.140]  We should have to give our organs up.
[00:50:58.901 --> 00:50:59.982]  We'll be right back, Al Qaeda.
[00:51:03.081 --> 00:51:06.023]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.684 --> 00:51:07.965]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:08.185 --> 00:51:13.909]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:14.189 --> 00:51:19.453]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.753 --> 00:51:23.896]  Brace yourselves, as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:24.056 --> 00:51:27.839]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:28.099 --> 00:51:32.682]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.802 --> 00:51:39.066]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:39.126 --> 00:51:41.008]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:41.428 --> 00:51:43.530]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:51:43.610 --> 00:51:46.191]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:46.331 --> 00:51:50.014]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:50.735 --> 00:51:55.138]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:51:55.258 --> 00:51:57.239]  You see, Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:51:57.479 --> 00:51:59.020]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.282]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:02.188 --> 00:52:06.072]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:06.292 --> 00:52:11.737]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:12.017 --> 00:52:22.387]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:22.547 --> 00:52:26.891]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria and cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:27.071 --> 00:52:27.872]  We're good to go.
[00:52:42.008 --> 00:52:42.388]  I think so.
[00:53:01.835 --> 00:53:07.238]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment, ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[00:53:07.379 --> 00:53:15.684]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals, and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[00:53:15.904 --> 00:53:17.525]  More than likely, this includes you.
[00:53:17.685 --> 00:53:20.787]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.

[00:54:04.658 --> 00:54:10.702]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:11.302 --> 00:54:14.284]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.246 --> 00:54:20.748]  This is how it happens, being basted, marinated, and evil.
[00:54:21.608 --> 00:54:24.370]  Being slow cooked.
[00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:28.232]  30 years of fake professional wrestling, bashing chairs, piledriving people.
[00:54:29.013 --> 00:54:30.134]  And then now they have real
[00:54:31.608 --> 00:54:34.551]  Ultimate fighting contest.
[00:54:34.571 --> 00:54:35.612]  They're breaking noses.
[00:54:35.932 --> 00:54:37.434]  People are dying sometimes.
[00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:38.995]  I mean, that's real, folks.
[00:54:39.015 --> 00:54:41.577]  If you really start punching somebody, people go to the hospital.
[00:54:42.378 --> 00:54:47.823]  And there I am, in this restaurant, off about ten yards away.
[00:54:48.163 --> 00:54:49.164]  There's a bar area.
[00:54:49.184 --> 00:54:50.205]  They've got TVs on.
[00:54:50.245 --> 00:54:51.026]  I'm sitting there eating.
[00:54:51.426 --> 00:54:54.529]  And I'm looking, and I've seen it before.
[00:54:54.569 --> 00:54:56.931]  Now it's just on mainstream TV, not even pay-per-view.
[00:54:58.761 --> 00:55:01.962]  And this is how we're all being conditioned, folks.
[00:55:02.882 --> 00:55:04.082]  All being conditioned.
[00:55:04.382 --> 00:55:05.403]  And none of us are safe.
[00:55:05.843 --> 00:55:11.404]  You know, societies have morals because we're a predatory, very aggressive species.
[00:55:11.704 --> 00:55:12.864]  That's why we have police.
[00:55:12.904 --> 00:55:14.044]  That's why we have laws.
[00:55:14.585 --> 00:55:14.945]  Okay?
[00:55:15.625 --> 00:55:25.247]  Because if we don't, we descend into barbarian, literal human sacrifice and pure evil.
[00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:27.092]  That's human history.
[00:55:27.512 --> 00:55:28.954]  And we're now descending into it.
[00:55:28.974 --> 00:55:29.735]  I hope you know that.
[00:55:30.396 --> 00:55:32.139]  And the controllers know exactly what they're doing.
[00:55:32.179 --> 00:55:33.941]  Ron, finish up your point about our organs.
[00:55:34.222 --> 00:55:37.467]  My point is, when you start harvesting organs from human beings...
[00:55:38.743 --> 00:55:39.984]  Okay, in that manner.
[00:55:40.244 --> 00:55:45.328]  What you're doing is devaluating the human being down to nothing more than a consumer product.
[00:55:45.688 --> 00:55:46.349]  It's material.
[00:55:46.529 --> 00:55:47.349]  What do they call it?
[00:55:47.369 --> 00:55:50.031]  A business where there are 15 employees, they call it human resources.
[00:55:50.271 --> 00:55:50.732]  That's right.
[00:55:50.852 --> 00:55:52.053]  And that's what they turn you into.
[00:55:52.073 --> 00:56:01.760]  And it's all part of the gradual effort, okay, to dehumanize you and get you acclimated to your own dehuman and devaluization as a spiritual human being created by God.
[00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:07.784]  And on top of that, we all know these transports or transplants cost a lot of money.
[00:56:08.584 --> 00:56:13.326]  Who derives a financial benefit from an organ that they take out of you against your own will?
[00:56:13.366 --> 00:56:15.887]  That's, I mean, if that's not your property, what is?
[00:56:15.907 --> 00:56:16.827]  I know!
[00:56:17.327 --> 00:56:19.008]  I mean, they get at least $150,000 for a liver.
[00:56:23.095 --> 00:56:26.159]  They get $50,000 to $100,000 for a kidney.
[00:56:26.479 --> 00:56:27.080]  And you're right.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:27.821]  I've heard them.
[00:56:28.261 --> 00:56:31.946]  And might it not encourage doctors to help give people a push over the edge?
[00:56:32.146 --> 00:56:38.233]  My dad, my dad told me when I went to get my driver's license when I was 16, he said, don't sign the organ donor card.
[00:56:38.634 --> 00:56:40.576]  Some hospitals will kill you to get them.
[00:56:40.856 --> 00:56:42.018]  And I rolled my eyes.
[00:56:42.558 --> 00:56:53.284]  And then there I was eating dinner with my grandparents, watching TV when I was like 22, and they had a 60 minutes piece where they showed hospitals, one of them in Illinois, killing people for organs.
[00:56:53.324 --> 00:56:53.964]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:56.105 --> 00:56:56.626]  That's right.
[00:56:57.086 --> 00:57:00.448]  They caught on Austin Hospital, and it's happened all over the country, stealing corneas.
[00:57:02.509 --> 00:57:04.470]  But again, you're with Al-Qaeda if you're against it.
[00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.751]  You must be with Al-Qaeda if you don't let them have your organs.
[00:57:07.111 --> 00:57:08.032]  Everything's Al-Qaeda.
[00:57:08.112 --> 00:57:08.992]  Everything's terrorism.
[00:57:09.252 --> 00:57:09.773]  We're bad.
[00:57:09.813 --> 00:57:10.173]  We're bad.
[00:57:10.845 --> 00:57:12.306]  The good news is people are waking up.
[00:57:12.346 --> 00:57:13.606]  Folks aren't going along with this.
[00:57:15.107 --> 00:57:29.994]  Before we end this hour and come back with Paul Watson and Larry and Mike and John and many others, I'll be showing my new film, Marshall Law, 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, Thursday night, but it sold out last week, to the smaller theater this time at Alamo Draft House South, the 130-seater.
[00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:34.576]  One last showing next week in the 200-and-something seat theater.
[00:57:35.276 --> 00:57:36.517]  One last showing.
[00:57:36.557 --> 00:57:37.477]  This is the last
[00:57:38.444 --> 00:57:42.087]  I mean, at the end of the summer I might have another showing, but this is the last for months.
[00:57:42.888 --> 00:57:49.013]  This is the last at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar, coming up next Monday.
[00:57:49.974 --> 00:57:50.334]  Okay?
[00:57:50.875 --> 00:57:53.657]  Coming up next Monday.
[00:57:54.598 --> 00:57:55.799]  Or in about six days.
[00:57:56.079 --> 00:57:58.301]  Next Monday is the last showing.
[00:57:58.341 --> 00:58:05.568]  Go to InfoWars.com, link through, get your tickets there at the Alamo Draft House, or drive by at the door and get them early because it will probably sell out again.
[00:58:06.883 --> 00:58:11.105]  If you want hard copies of Martial Law and find out what all the hubbub's about, it's my best film.

[00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:46.940]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.460]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.969 --> 00:59:03.050]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.731 --> 00:59:04.551]  You want answers?
[00:59:05.312 --> 00:59:07.234]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:07.254 --> 00:59:10.737]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:11.057 --> 00:59:15.181]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.242 --> 00:59:23.288]  Alright, now into hour number two of this 21st day of June 2005, this Tuesday edition.
[00:59:23.988 --> 00:59:29.333]  Paul Joseph Watson, who joins us every couple of weeks, is on with us for the next two consecutive hours.
[00:59:30.689 --> 00:59:34.292]  I want to bring up a new development with Silverstein and the World Trade Center 7 building.
[00:59:50.533 --> 00:59:57.940]  And talk about Downing Street Memo and this classic bait-and-switch maneuver which the establishment media have pulled again.
[00:59:58.341 --> 01:00:02.264]  Is Silverstein, as I've heard, I've seen the article, is he now responding?
[01:00:03.305 --> 01:00:04.246]  He has responded.
[01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:05.667]  That's the story.
[01:00:05.908 --> 01:00:06.728]  We can go over it.
[01:00:06.748 --> 01:00:08.910]  Alright, let's do that after the break.
[01:00:08.951 --> 01:00:12.454]  Let's go to Larry in... Larry, where are you calling us from?
[01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:15.344]  Lori!
[01:00:15.684 --> 01:00:16.204]  Yeah, hi!
[01:00:16.504 --> 01:00:18.805]  Where are you calling from?
[01:00:19.045 --> 01:00:19.865]  San Diego.
[01:00:20.285 --> 01:00:21.426]  Sorry Lori.
[01:00:22.346 --> 01:00:23.126]  What are you sorry about?
[01:00:23.146 --> 01:00:24.306]  For calling you Larry.
[01:00:24.326 --> 01:00:25.647]  Oh, that's okay.
[01:00:25.707 --> 01:00:26.167]  Go ahead.
[01:00:26.787 --> 01:00:29.508]  Listen, first of all I want to say you're an American hero.
[01:00:29.528 --> 01:00:31.368]  Thank you.
[01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:33.449]  You are truly an American hero.
[01:00:34.329 --> 01:00:38.350]  Alex, I used to be a first call driver here in San Diego.
[01:00:38.370 --> 01:00:43.611]  I don't know if you know what that is, but what I did was pick up all the dead bodies in town
[01:00:44.628 --> 01:00:47.730]  All the traffic accidents and suicides and that kind of thing?
[01:00:47.830 --> 01:00:48.171]  Yes.
[01:00:48.891 --> 01:01:12.508]  And back in 2000, I think it was 2002, early 2002, it could have been late 2001, there was a crematorium in Marietta, that's real close to Riverside, California, that the guy who owned the place got busted for selling body parts illegally.
[01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.073]  Did you know about that?
[01:01:15.313 --> 01:01:19.436]  I don't remember that particular case, but every few months we see an article along those lines.
[01:01:19.496 --> 01:01:22.678]  I mean, have you heard about this type of hospitals caught selling organs?
[01:01:23.158 --> 01:01:37.408]  Well, apparently if you sign the papers to let them take your ligaments or one thing or another, but not anything else, they take what they want.
[01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:40.513]  Hey, I know this.
[01:01:40.593 --> 01:01:44.394]  Hospitals have been caught taking organs when the person said, I don't want my organs taken.
[01:01:44.434 --> 01:01:44.674]  Right.
[01:01:44.774 --> 01:01:53.896]  Well, this place, I think it was called Pacifica Crematorium, they got caught taking all kinds of organs.
[01:01:53.936 --> 01:02:00.118]  They found legs and heads and arms and organs and whatever scattered around the place.
[01:02:02.049 --> 01:02:03.370]  The guy got busted.
[01:02:03.490 --> 01:02:08.412]  Those must have been in use for university studies because they're only good for organ transplantation.
[01:02:08.612 --> 01:02:08.893]  Right.
[01:02:08.913 --> 01:02:09.953]  They're taken within minutes.
[01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:27.562]  Well before I stopped working I had called the news stations because I thought it was important that people knew because a lot of the mortuaries were sending the bodies up there to have them cremated and I thought that you know people needed to know and the news
[01:02:28.098 --> 01:02:28.679]  We're good to go.
[01:02:43.709 --> 01:02:47.691]  It was not only PA cases, but it was private cases also.
[01:02:47.911 --> 01:02:49.592]  And really, who cares?
[01:02:49.652 --> 01:02:56.455]  Regardless, the caller earlier was bringing up reports I have seen where the big medical associations are now wanting to take your organs regardless.
[01:02:57.255 --> 01:02:57.955]  There's no choice.
[01:02:57.995 --> 01:02:59.956]  Well, thank you for the call, Lori.
[01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:00.576]  Good to hear from you.
[01:03:00.596 --> 01:03:01.797]  Paul, comments to what she was saying?
[01:03:02.771 --> 01:03:05.012]  Well, yeah, it's the same case in this country.
[01:03:05.993 --> 01:03:15.197]  They use emotional blackmail to make people carry around these donor cards, which say, you know, in the event of your death, would you like to help someone else?
[01:03:16.018 --> 01:03:23.682]  Have you seen the Monty Python, meaning a light skit, where they go, would you like to give your organs, as soon as she signs the card, they kill her?
[01:03:23.942 --> 01:03:26.023]  Well, it's not far off the truth.
[01:03:26.043 --> 01:03:28.024]  I mean, we've got a socialized health system.
[01:03:28.284 --> 01:03:29.064]  The good old NHS.
[01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:33.101]  Remember how sweet they are to her and then she signs it and they go, alright!
[01:03:34.323 --> 01:03:34.963]  Have you seen that?
[01:03:35.504 --> 01:03:36.986]  No, Paul, I mean it's pretty funny.
[01:03:37.006 --> 01:03:38.147]  It's pretty scary.
[01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:39.048]  Alright, well stay there, Paul.
[01:03:39.308 --> 01:03:42.452]  We'll come back and get into Larry Silverstein and some of the news and we'll go to Mike and John and others.
[01:03:43.153 --> 01:03:44.515]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[01:03:44.535 --> 01:03:45.216]  You don't want to miss it.
[01:03:45.256 --> 01:03:48.640]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net and PrisonPlanet.tv!
[01:03:55.467 --> 01:03:58.348]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.588 --> 01:04:00.168]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.509 --> 01:04:05.190]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:09.952]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:10.372 --> 01:04:14.553]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.773 --> 01:04:17.614]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.694 --> 01:04:22.375]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:22.575 --> 01:04:26.976]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:27.216 --> 01:04:34.437]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.677 --> 01:04:37.118]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:37.278 --> 01:04:39.018]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:54.258 --> 01:04:57.759]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[01:04:58.019 --> 01:05:01.520]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.541]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:05.781 --> 01:05:11.942]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:12.342 --> 01:05:20.244]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.

[01:06:00.152 --> 01:06:00.972]  Read the labels.
[01:06:01.413 --> 01:06:05.516]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.756 --> 01:06:09.940]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[01:06:42.921 --> 01:06:44.142]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:44.162 --> 01:06:45.463]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.657 --> 01:07:29.466]  Coming up later today, in three or four hours, Paul Watson, who's put out a report on Lord Limbaugh, promoting torture, who's put out a report this week, of course, on how they're trying to discredit the Downing Street Memo, and who's now going to be putting out a report on a Silverstein response.
[01:07:30.206 --> 01:07:33.188]  Larry Silverstein, of course, the owner, years before of Building 7,
[01:07:34.358 --> 01:07:41.161]  And then a few months before 9-11, he bought the entire complex and took out a $3.2 billion insurance policy.
[01:07:41.661 --> 01:07:45.383]  He's now collected $7 billion, calling it two separate events.
[01:07:46.643 --> 01:07:47.324]  Just amazing.
[01:07:48.124 --> 01:07:49.585]  And he even wants more money than that.
[01:07:49.685 --> 01:07:51.325]  And I've called his office many times.
[01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:52.306]  The press has called it.
[01:07:52.866 --> 01:07:59.069]  Jimmy Walters, the heir of the Walters home building, spent over $2 million in ads in New York alone.
[01:08:00.283 --> 01:08:04.047]  Asking Larry Silverstein about Building 7, going, well you said this, would you like to respond?
[01:08:04.067 --> 01:08:05.909]  You know, showing the building collapsing.
[01:08:08.031 --> 01:08:17.220]  And I've done several national talk shows, not just my own, hundreds of times, mentioning and playing clips, but been on Coast to Coast AM, talked about it, been on New York talk shows, talked about it.
[01:08:19.262 --> 01:08:24.447]  But we're told now, through our sources, that, and we're getting all the names of these people,
[01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:36.150]  But Simon Aranowitz, who's a colleague of Paul's over in England, talked directly to the reporter, who did talk to Silverstein, but decided not to include this, so you're hearing it here first.
[01:08:37.871 --> 01:08:43.076]  Of course, David Shaler, the MI5 agent, was talking about it yesterday, because he has the same source, Aranowitz.
[01:08:43.636 --> 01:08:47.660]  Paul, give us the scoop now, and then we'll see the report this afternoon as you
[01:08:48.627 --> 01:08:52.749]  Double and triple source it, but I want you to call that New York office too as soon as possible.
[01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:54.490]  But give us the latest development.
[01:08:54.951 --> 01:08:58.353]  Again, Silverstein folks is the one that said, we gave the order to pull Building 7.
[01:08:59.113 --> 01:09:07.138]  Now regardless of him saying pull it, and that being the demolition term, we have people in the same documentary saying pull it means demolition from the New York demolition crews.
[01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:10.800]  Regardless of all of that, we know the building was demolished.
[01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:15.463]  Nothing hit it, it caught fire, small fires, perfectly imploded, central column blown first.
[01:09:15.863 --> 01:09:17.864]  But Paul, tell us about this new development.
[01:09:18.872 --> 01:09:19.893]  Well, that's basically it.
[01:09:19.913 --> 01:09:28.903]  I mean, you had the former MI5 agent, David Chaylor, who agreed across the board that the evidence shows clear government involvement in 9-11.
[01:09:29.103 --> 01:09:35.670]  He also talked about, you know, the Israelis blowing up their own embassy, which I had wrote about in order out of chaos.
[01:09:36.751 --> 01:09:39.094]  And he mentioned the fact that Silverstein did in fact
[01:09:39.841 --> 01:09:51.473]  Respond to the questions surrounding his comments on PBS, which piqued my interest to looking into what the actual source of it was because Schaler wasn't too sure of the source of where he got that.
[01:09:53.115 --> 01:09:59.461]  And yeah, we can confirm that it was actually a New York Post writer who was kind of writing a whitewash article about 9-11.
[01:10:01.078 --> 01:10:09.159]  Who asked Silverstein about the Pull-It issue and those comments were made to her that he had meant something different when he said Pull-It.
[01:10:09.699 --> 01:10:18.281]  But in all her, you know, establishment journalistic wisdom, she didn't think the comments merited a mention in her article, so it was never published.
[01:10:19.181 --> 01:10:22.422]  And, um, that comes from someone who's already spoke to her.
[01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:24.962]  Anna Ranowitz has given us a lot of good info in the past.
[01:10:25.582 --> 01:10:27.343]  You're saying he specifically talked to her?
[01:10:28.463 --> 01:10:29.883]  That's what the journalist says, yeah.
[01:10:30.714 --> 01:10:36.358]  So, I mean, the question is, if Silverstein didn't mean to demolish the building, then what did he mean?
[01:10:36.798 --> 01:10:40.480]  You know, it's obvious that the kid's being caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
[01:10:40.661 --> 01:10:42.081]  He's trying to make up excuses.
[01:10:43.082 --> 01:10:50.667]  We've played the clip probably hundreds of times now, where the demolition team is talking about demolishing the buildings after 9-11.
[01:10:50.767 --> 01:10:53.469]  They use the term, pull it, as demolition.
[01:10:54.478 --> 01:11:03.229]  Um, we know for a fact that although the building had been evacuated, there was still Secret Service personnel in the building who died when it collapsed.
[01:11:03.469 --> 01:11:05.091]  So they weren't told to evacuate.
[01:11:05.111 --> 01:11:10.597]  And then, of course, the biggest reason of all, the building collapsed exactly like a controlled demolition.
[01:11:10.677 --> 01:11:11.939]  It wasn't even hit by a plane.
[01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:35.672]  So, the fact that Silverstein hasn't made the effort to make this justification, this excuse in the wider media, and was only, you know, willing to comment on it when Push tells us that he's not comfortable in being questioned on it, in the face of what now must be hundreds of people calling his office asking about it, and it's all over the internet.
[01:11:36.032 --> 01:11:38.613]  I mean, it's tabloid... Well, he coast-to-coasters on WABC.
[01:11:40.532 --> 01:11:44.354]  Ted, I've been on there twice now going, Mr. Silverstein, please answer the question.
[01:11:44.374 --> 01:11:47.755]  I mean, before we went with that article, remember when we first discovered this?
[01:11:47.775 --> 01:11:52.016]  It was on a small patriot website and didn't get any traction.
[01:11:52.057 --> 01:11:53.497]  We posted it and it got picked up.
[01:11:54.177 --> 01:11:57.359]  So that shows how listeners and activists out there helped dig this up.
[01:11:57.879 --> 01:12:00.880]  And, you know, notice this stuff hidden in plain view because it aired on national TV.
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:04.121]  But it took like a year after it aired for us to even notice it.
[01:12:05.602 --> 01:12:07.142]  I said, hold off on writing anything.
[01:12:07.162 --> 01:12:08.583]  I gotta call Silverstein's office.
[01:12:09.286 --> 01:12:11.307]  So for two days, I called over and over again.
[01:12:12.668 --> 01:12:13.509]  And just no comment.
[01:12:13.989 --> 01:12:14.529]  No comment.
[01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.630]  No comment.
[01:12:16.451 --> 01:12:18.912]  And you know, I don't... I want to get this reporter on.
[01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:23.295]  We'll be disclosing their name here in the next day, but... Her name.
[01:12:23.875 --> 01:12:28.938]  But I find it very suspicious that the reporter would ask the question, but then it wouldn't be included.
[01:12:29.499 --> 01:12:32.801]  I got a sneaking suspicion that's an editorial decision that was made.
[01:12:33.579 --> 01:12:36.060]  Well, New York Post is a Murdoch paper.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.881]  I'm sure there is tight editorial control on a comment, you know, of that magnitude.
[01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:46.782]  So it's perfectly reasonable that it would have been intentionally removed from the album.
[01:12:46.802 --> 01:12:50.243]  So to be clear, you talked to Oranoitz and you're emailing with him right now, you're getting all the data.
[01:12:50.623 --> 01:12:52.363]  He said, he talked to her and she said this.
[01:12:53.363 --> 01:12:55.984]  That's what he told me earlier today, yeah.
[01:12:56.624 --> 01:12:57.904]  And we'll get the name later on.
[01:12:57.924 --> 01:12:59.564]  Well, his info's always checked out.
[01:12:59.584 --> 01:13:01.745]  He's doing a lot of good journalistic work, so...
[01:13:02.446 --> 01:13:05.967]  He's the guy that got Shiler to go public here on the show.
[01:13:07.107 --> 01:13:09.367]  Alright, well we'll follow this as it is.
[01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:10.808]  I'd love to get Silverstein on.
[01:13:11.588 --> 01:13:13.088]  We'd like to hear his side of things.
[01:13:13.788 --> 01:13:18.409]  Well, I mean, it's interesting because they're all acting like cornered animals.
[01:13:18.949 --> 01:13:21.370]  It's going to be interesting, you know, what moves they make next.
[01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:26.031]  Because they've shifted explanations on why the towers collapsed three different times.
[01:13:26.727 --> 01:13:31.069]  So I'm just waiting for the day when they hold their hands up and say, you're right.
[01:13:31.309 --> 01:13:33.870]  You know, the buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[01:13:34.330 --> 01:13:36.631]  I've been looking for them and I've been saying this for a couple of years.
[01:13:36.671 --> 01:13:38.491]  They're going to finally claim Al-Qaeda did it?
[01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:39.272]  Exactly.
[01:13:39.372 --> 01:13:45.514]  We heard this with Peter Lance, the former Nightline executive and lawyer who I was arguing with Thursday night.
[01:13:45.534 --> 01:13:49.176]  And he said, well, we knew a top Al-Qaeda guy had been in the building.
[01:13:49.456 --> 01:13:52.857]  You know, like somebody with a satchel can... I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:13:53.832 --> 01:13:56.893]  Well, they'll drag out some tortured Muslim to admit to it all.
[01:13:57.773 --> 01:14:01.014]  And, you know, if they get that desperate, it's all over for them.
[01:14:01.654 --> 01:14:10.237]  You talked about yesterday the level of planning and detail it takes to wire one building, never mind three or four, and have them collapse in such a symmetrical fashion.
[01:14:11.077 --> 01:14:14.658]  But if they go that far, then it's pure stupidity on their part.
[01:14:15.338 --> 01:14:16.338]  Yeah, they're in a catch-22.
[01:14:16.358 --> 01:14:21.820]  They either can't respond, and then we keep destroying them, or they respond and we destroy them.
[01:14:22.478 --> 01:14:26.520]  Well, they're under such a relentless assault from all sides on 9-11.
[01:14:26.901 --> 01:14:30.103]  In general, they might start making bigger and bigger mistakes.
[01:14:30.603 --> 01:14:31.644]  So it could happen.
[01:14:31.744 --> 01:14:38.248]  You know, do you think Silverstein was just told it's national security and maybe wasn't conscious or wasn't involved?
[01:14:38.288 --> 01:14:46.893]  Maybe that, I mean, because that type of slip-up where he just calmly goes, well, we made the decision to pull it so it didn't, you know, hurt anything else and we made the decision and gave the order and watched it come down.
[01:14:47.413 --> 01:14:56.321]  I mean, you know, that type of just cavalier statement, that interview was done just months after and then, you know, aired about a year after 9-11, maybe he isn't bad.
[01:14:56.341 --> 01:14:58.442]  I mean, maybe they told him that.
[01:14:58.482 --> 01:15:01.044]  I mean, we know they told AP reporters, get back, we're going to pull it.
[01:15:01.505 --> 01:15:02.005]  Maybe.
[01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:10.632]  You made a point in martial law that the only buildings that collapsed were ones owned by him and then we had the, what was it, $7 billion insurance payout after.
[01:15:11.073 --> 01:15:15.897]  So, follow the money and it's highly implausible that
[01:15:17.505 --> 01:15:18.886]  He wouldn't have knowledge of that.
[01:15:18.926 --> 01:15:33.432]  I mean, Giuliani was in Building 7 before he evacuated it, right before the towers collapsed, the South Tower, and he was told, he told ABC's Peter Jennings, we were told the tower was about to collapse and we got out of the building.
[01:15:33.472 --> 01:15:35.052]  He was in Building 7 at the time.
[01:15:36.253 --> 01:15:46.677]  And we have that clip on OnPrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com and the WTC, just type Alex Jones WTC7 into a search engine and you'll get links to it.
[01:15:47.578 --> 01:15:49.739]  We've got to make that more of a prominent link, Paul.
[01:15:51.659 --> 01:15:57.121]  Well, and then there's the, you know, you've got all the chaos going on in Ground Zero.
[01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:06.804]  The justification that they would pull a building, demolish a building, to try and calm the chaos doesn't make sense.
[01:16:06.864 --> 01:16:08.344]  That's a total contradiction.
[01:16:09.679 --> 01:16:17.564]  So, I mean, it needs to be explored more in more depth, but the fact that he's still reticent to make a public response speaks volumes.
[01:16:18.605 --> 01:16:23.768]  Well, I think that for people who haven't been to New York and haven't seen it, they've now rebuilt Building 7.
[01:16:25.249 --> 01:16:32.013]  But, literally, this 47-story building is like 20-something feet and then 40-something feet.
[01:16:33.594 --> 01:16:34.135]  I measured it.
[01:16:34.195 --> 01:16:38.758]  It's like 20 feet from this other 15-story building that wasn't even damaged.
[01:16:38.858 --> 01:16:39.078]  I mean,
[01:16:39.867 --> 01:16:42.310]  There are these huge buildings right up next to it.
[01:16:42.490 --> 01:16:44.692]  It falls and they don't even get hurt, Paul!
[01:16:45.633 --> 01:16:46.594]  It's ridiculous!
[01:16:48.316 --> 01:16:49.817]  But Tower 1 and 2 fall.
[01:16:50.298 --> 01:16:52.640]  Some of the smoke hits Building 7.
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.022]  It's not even in the official debris field, folks.
[01:16:55.803 --> 01:16:57.345]  And then fires start in it.
[01:16:57.845 --> 01:16:59.387]  And then it magically collapses.
[01:16:59.427 --> 01:17:00.828]  I mean, how obvious does this get?
[01:17:00.848 --> 01:17:02.730]  You've got to be there to see it, though.
[01:17:04.216 --> 01:17:05.937]  Well, you talked about it yesterday.
[01:17:05.957 --> 01:17:08.158]  We've been on the controlled demolition website.
[01:17:08.339 --> 01:17:12.801]  They've got dozens and dozens of videos of controlled demolitions of buildings.
[01:17:13.502 --> 01:17:17.984]  Exactly the same as World Trade Center towers and Building 7.
[01:17:18.405 --> 01:17:20.346]  Exactly the same type of implosion.
[01:17:21.427 --> 01:17:23.688]  But, I mean, they might come out and say Al-Qaeda did it.
[01:17:25.402 --> 01:17:27.042]  How they're going to justify that, we don't know.
[01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:40.066]  We do know that there were numerous power downs in the World Trade Center before the attack, where certain floors were evacuated and government officials, personnel went in there to fix the problems.
[01:17:40.086 --> 01:17:45.647]  Well yeah, there were like three-day weekends where it was totally closed with men with guns guarding it.
[01:17:46.108 --> 01:17:46.988]  No big deal though, Paul.
[01:17:47.708 --> 01:17:48.768]  They were just in there helping.
[01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:55.030]  And it's true that they removed the bomb dogs before the attack as well.
[01:17:56.164 --> 01:17:58.285]  So I mean that obviously points to who did it.
[01:17:58.785 --> 01:18:00.306]  But they may claim Al-Qaeda did it.
[01:18:00.646 --> 01:18:06.389]  And then somebody's on the radio from Building 7 telling everybody to stay at their post in Tower 1 and 2.
[01:18:07.169 --> 01:18:08.130]  Everything's fine.
[01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:10.431]  There's smoke coming out of the... Everything's fine.
[01:18:10.451 --> 01:18:11.271]  Stay at your post.
[01:18:12.071 --> 01:18:13.692]  But you know they told us 19 hijackers...
[01:18:16.113 --> 01:18:21.418]  Six or seven of which are still alive and said they were still alive two days after the attack carried out the attack.
[01:18:21.458 --> 01:18:24.000]  So if they can tell us that and get away with it, then who knows?
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:33.148]  I mean, Mohammed Atta's father has been out in the media once immediately after 9-11 and once again last year saying that his son's still alive.
[01:18:33.168 --> 01:18:34.749]  He talks to him on the phone regularly.
[01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:37.552]  Well, Paul, I'll tell you what happened.
[01:18:37.612 --> 01:18:42.056]  Al-Qaeda was in control of Building 7 and they told the people to stay at their desks.
[01:18:44.167 --> 01:18:46.434]  And that earthquake that happened in California last week?
[01:18:47.116 --> 01:18:48.098]  That was Al-Qaeda too.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.562]  And if I stub my toe?
[01:18:50.244 --> 01:18:50.726]  Al-Qaeda.
[01:18:51.187 --> 01:18:51.729]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.684 --> 01:18:58.586]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:58.786 --> 01:19:11.073]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:11.493 --> 01:19:11.893]  The U.S.
[01:19:11.933 --> 01:19:17.536]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:17.936 --> 01:19:20.137]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:21.998 --> 01:19:23.059]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:23.099 --> 01:19:25.940]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:32.083]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:32.503 --> 01:19:35.865]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:42.268]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[01:19:42.828 --> 01:19:46.850]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[01:19:46.970 --> 01:19:47.150]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:47.170 --> 01:19:47.390]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.426 --> 01:19:56.047]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:56.187 --> 01:20:00.328]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:03.309]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:03.389 --> 01:20:10.091]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:13.292]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:13.492 --> 01:20:15.872]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:16.013 --> 01:20:23.895]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:20:24.275 --> 01:20:35.484]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:20:35.664 --> 01:20:43.591]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:20:57.742 --> 01:21:03.365]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:21:03.385 --> 01:21:04.165]  Supreme Court.
[01:21:04.925 --> 01:21:09.227]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an I-Nothing decision of the U.S.
[01:21:09.267 --> 01:21:12.889]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:21:13.869 --> 01:21:19.092]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[01:21:59.305 --> 01:22:07.593]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals, and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[01:22:07.833 --> 01:22:09.435]  More than likely, this includes you.
[01:22:09.615 --> 01:22:12.718]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need for Mother Earth minerals.

[01:22:59.172 --> 01:23:01.073]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:01.533 --> 01:23:04.274]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:23:06.391 --> 01:23:09.232]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:23:11.953 --> 01:23:17.396]  I want to go to Mike and Jim and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:22.558]  And then we'll get back into just a whole bunch of other news items with Paul Watson.
[01:23:23.598 --> 01:23:25.619]  Let's talk to Jason first in Iowa.
[01:23:25.679 --> 01:23:26.619]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:27.140]  Go ahead.
[01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:28.600]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:29.301]  Hi.
[01:23:29.601 --> 01:23:30.901]  Yeah, a couple things I wanted to talk about.
[01:23:30.921 --> 01:23:34.343]  The, uh, about the desolate bag.
[01:23:35.598 --> 01:23:43.844]  Funny, I was listening to him yesterday, and he just spouts on about this stuff.
[01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:46.086]  You're on a cordless phone, aren't you?
[01:23:46.206 --> 01:23:46.426]  Yeah.
[01:23:47.046 --> 01:23:47.627]  Yeah, I don't know why.
[01:23:47.907 --> 01:23:50.389]  Cordless phones are just horrible.
[01:23:50.429 --> 01:23:51.489]  I can barely understand you.
[01:23:51.810 --> 01:23:52.310]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:53.891]  Try to talk right into your receiver, sir.
[01:23:54.051 --> 01:23:54.592]  Okay, sorry.
[01:23:54.812 --> 01:23:55.532]  Oh, I can hear you now.
[01:23:55.733 --> 01:23:56.593]  Okay, sorry.
[01:23:56.633 --> 01:23:59.435]  Just talk right into that little... Go ahead.
[01:24:00.116 --> 01:24:01.657]  The fix for that, I think, would be
[01:24:02.301 --> 01:24:07.003]  Sending him to Guantanamo Bay Bean's house for his little drug thing.
[01:24:07.683 --> 01:24:08.403]  Just send him there.
[01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.624]  That'll fix that problem.
[01:24:09.684 --> 01:24:14.486]  I was thinking he ought to broadcast from a cage with all the mosquitoes from a swamp somewhere.
[01:24:14.506 --> 01:24:14.966]  There you go.
[01:24:15.146 --> 01:24:15.766]  For a week.
[01:24:15.866 --> 01:24:18.207]  He probably thinks it's so great.
[01:24:18.427 --> 01:24:20.908]  Another thing I'd like to talk about or ask you about.
[01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:22.409]  Bohemian Grove.
[01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:23.749]  That should be happening right now.
[01:24:23.769 --> 01:24:24.330]  Should it not be?
[01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:26.971]  July 15th to July 30th.
[01:24:26.991 --> 01:24:27.431]  July.
[01:24:27.451 --> 01:24:27.871]  That's right.
[01:24:27.951 --> 01:24:28.231]  Okay.
[01:24:28.851 --> 01:24:30.292]  So we've got another month or so, right?
[01:24:31.084 --> 01:24:36.187]  Yes, our Christian conservative leaders will be worshipping Satan in about 25 days.
[01:24:36.307 --> 01:24:41.270]  Yes, are you going to, I mean, will there be any notice of when it's taking place?
[01:24:41.330 --> 01:24:44.071]  I'm glad you reminded me of this.
[01:24:44.772 --> 01:24:50.335]  There may be some developments this year with the grove.
[01:24:50.735 --> 01:24:52.236]  That's all I can say.
[01:24:53.737 --> 01:24:55.878]  But we will be covering it.
[01:24:56.218 --> 01:24:58.139]  Okay, I got a song I might put up on your site.
[01:24:58.199 --> 01:24:59.620]  It's using some of your stuff on that.
[01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:04.384]  I'll put up on, I've seen a little area you can go to.
[01:25:04.524 --> 01:25:05.504]  Yeah, email Paul.
[01:25:06.545 --> 01:25:07.365]  Oh, email Paul?
[01:25:07.605 --> 01:25:09.585]  Yeah, it says email Webmaster at Prison Planet.
[01:25:09.785 --> 01:25:10.046]  Okay.
[01:25:10.646 --> 01:25:11.506]  Alright, thank you.
[01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:13.366]  Thank you, Jason.
[01:25:13.386 --> 01:25:13.867]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:14.247 --> 01:25:16.167]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air with Paul Watson.
[01:25:16.187 --> 01:25:16.727]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:25:17.287 --> 01:25:19.408]  Yes, Alex and Paul.
[01:25:20.235 --> 01:25:20.916]  Excellent show.
[01:25:21.156 --> 01:25:23.118]  I have a couple of follow-up questions.
[01:25:23.338 --> 01:25:29.804]  Last week you had interviewed Ted Pike and Jack McLam about this Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, HR 2662.
[01:25:30.205 --> 01:25:32.607]  Yeah, the thought crime law.
[01:25:33.107 --> 01:25:33.848]  Yes, exactly.
[01:25:34.128 --> 01:25:42.677]  Now, a year or so ago they had one that was in the Senate, it was S-966, and that had been revealed that a lot of that was written by the ADL.
[01:25:42.817 --> 01:25:44.098]  Oh, it's admitted, yeah.
[01:25:44.696 --> 01:25:47.218]  Yes, was HR 2662.
[01:25:47.338 --> 01:25:51.360]  Yeah, the same group that wants the Ten Commandments taken out of everything.
[01:25:51.821 --> 01:25:53.342]  Why do we put up with this?
[01:25:54.342 --> 01:25:55.223]  Because we're lemming.
[01:25:56.324 --> 01:26:03.729]  A couple other things you had touched on, there was something that you had mentioned about registering people that belong to hate groups, like sex offenders.
[01:26:04.529 --> 01:26:09.973]  Yeah, that was the ADL, that was in LA Weekly, the ADL, the Sheriff of LA County,
[01:26:10.768 --> 01:26:23.379]  Who's about as dirty as they come, openly saying, and you are even anti-open border, uh, we need to go ahead and arrest you, bring you into custody, interrogate you, and number you, and put you in a public database, without being convicted.
[01:26:23.399 --> 01:26:24.500]  And that's in the legislature.
[01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.300]  Paul, comment on it.
[01:26:26.421 --> 01:26:30.285]  Yeah, I believe that was Lee Bocca, um, down there in L.A.
[01:26:31.345 --> 01:26:33.367]  Um, yeah, everything's a hate crime.
[01:26:33.707 --> 01:26:38.912]  I mean, Limbaugh now says that a Downing Street memo talking about it might be a hate crime because
[01:26:39.503 --> 01:26:47.308]  Ray McGovern, in the hearing they had last Thursday, mentioned the fact that one of the reasons behind the war in Iraq was to protect the interests of Israel.
[01:26:47.568 --> 01:26:52.270]  So, criticizing the state of Israel is a hate crime, anti-Semitic.
[01:26:53.091 --> 01:26:56.833]  But half the Israelis are against the policies of Sharon.
[01:26:56.853 --> 01:26:58.074]  I guess they're anti-Semitic too?
[01:26:58.654 --> 01:27:04.057]  Well yeah, we have the photos of the Orthodox Jews who go out and protest in New York on regular occasions.
[01:27:04.957 --> 01:27:05.958]  Thousands of them.
[01:27:06.078 --> 01:27:07.439]  Never gets covered in the media.
[01:27:08.624 --> 01:27:11.166]  Well, you know, they're probably Al Qaeda too.
[01:27:11.646 --> 01:27:12.306]  Yeah, that's for sure.
[01:27:13.087 --> 01:27:15.008]  You mentioned something here also.
[01:27:15.448 --> 01:27:21.472]  Was there something about the ADL that suggested a jail time if you criticize Israel?
[01:27:22.852 --> 01:27:25.494]  Yeah, that would be in this new hate crime bill.
[01:27:26.204 --> 01:27:29.827]  Oh, that's in... Yeah, or if you don't want... Well, this already happened in Massachusetts.
[01:27:29.887 --> 01:27:38.933]  If you don't want your three-year-old, because it's going to be in preschool now, being taught Heather has two mommies, you will be arrested and serve years in prison.
[01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:42.155]  Okay, and all these things are all... Sir, I'm not joking, by the way.
[01:27:42.175 --> 01:27:42.635]  That's true.
[01:27:43.156 --> 01:27:44.777]  No, I fully believe you.
[01:27:44.797 --> 01:27:46.578]  These things are all linked on your website.
[01:27:47.208 --> 01:27:48.949]  Yeah, we posted them last week, yeah.
[01:27:49.169 --> 01:27:50.529]  That got international attention.
[01:27:50.549 --> 01:27:51.489]  No, they were facing 47 years.
[01:27:51.589 --> 01:27:53.330]  It was the White House advising them to the U.S.
[01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.530]  Attorney.
[01:28:06.886 --> 01:28:09.529]  Very Christian, conservative White House, and all they've done is pray.
[01:28:09.589 --> 01:28:12.212]  Luckily they've videoed all of it at an outfest.
[01:28:12.292 --> 01:28:16.918]  And again, folks, regardless of where you are on this issue, the point is, is they have a right to do that.
[01:28:17.658 --> 01:28:20.021]  And they were facing 47 years as terrorists.
[01:28:21.783 --> 01:28:21.943]  Huh.
[01:28:22.384 --> 01:28:23.205]  You didn't hear about that?
[01:28:23.765 --> 01:28:24.386]  No, I did not.
[01:28:24.406 --> 01:28:26.048]  That got international attention, yeah.
[01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.949]  Okay.
[01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:27.670]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:28.300 --> 01:28:30.341]  Yeah, Paul, we have those articles posted too, don't we?
[01:28:30.982 --> 01:28:37.245]  Yeah, repentamerica.com is the organization that's behind that, so everything's on there as well.
[01:28:37.425 --> 01:28:38.906]  Yeah, 47 years.
[01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.948]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:47.932]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.832 --> 01:28:51.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:58.251 --> 01:29:05.355]  Remember that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:29:05.735 --> 01:29:07.076]  It suppresses your immune system!
[01:29:07.276 --> 01:29:08.016]  Now check this out.
[01:29:08.237 --> 01:29:11.819]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:29:12.079 --> 01:29:14.340]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:17.242]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:29:17.602 --> 01:29:18.322]  Your health suffers.
[01:29:18.502 --> 01:29:19.183]  It's that simple.
[01:29:19.443 --> 01:29:21.404]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[01:29:21.684 --> 01:29:23.686]  With the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[01:29:23.846 --> 01:29:31.972]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you could fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[01:29:54.648 --> 01:29:56.249]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:56.389 --> 01:30:00.430]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:30:00.630 --> 01:30:03.511]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:03.591 --> 01:30:10.334]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:10.494 --> 01:30:13.495]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:13.695 --> 01:30:16.096]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:16.216 --> 01:30:20.938]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:21.118 --> 01:30:35.710]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:30:35.850 --> 01:30:42.376]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Murky Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-4-9-1.

[01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.341]  You've heard it over and over again.
[01:30:57.561 --> 01:31:00.021]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[01:31:00.381 --> 01:31:04.023]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[01:31:04.343 --> 01:31:09.184]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[01:31:09.524 --> 01:31:10.204]  Don't wait for when.
[01:31:10.464 --> 01:31:11.565]  It's important to act now.
[01:31:11.865 --> 01:31:15.546]  And Ready Reserve Foods has everything you need as your survival supply headquarters.
[01:31:15.786 --> 01:31:20.587]  Call 877-817-9829 and start preparing today for you and your family.
[01:31:20.847 --> 01:31:28.269]  Ready Reserve Foods has a one-year meal program that can feed an entire family of four for 365 days for as little as 59 cents per meal.
[01:31:28.429 --> 01:31:30.750]  Joyce cooked up a meal for the office and it tasted delicious.
[01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:33.190]  Ready Reserve Foods has everything for survival.
[01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:38.211]  From kits to shortwave radios, storage containers to non-hybrid garden seeds, and so much more.
[01:31:38.371 --> 01:31:40.272]  Literally everything you need for survival.
[01:31:40.632 --> 01:31:41.313]  Don't wait for when.
[01:31:41.633 --> 01:31:42.074]  Act now.
[01:31:42.354 --> 01:31:43.455]  Call for your free catalog.
[01:31:43.515 --> 01:31:43.975]  Toll free.
[01:31:43.995 --> 01:31:44.075]  877-817-9829.
[01:31:44.135 --> 01:31:44.416]  That's 877-817-9829.
[01:31:44.436 --> 01:31:46.458]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[01:32:01.861 --> 01:32:04.303]  Last Friday I did a good job of taking calls.
[01:32:04.323 --> 01:32:07.106]  We took about 50 calls in three hours.
[01:32:07.386 --> 01:32:08.547]  And still covered a lot of news.
[01:32:08.587 --> 01:32:12.291]  I'm not going to take that many, but I'll take about 20 more before the broadcast ends.
[01:32:12.331 --> 01:32:15.874]  So we'll keep the callers down to about a minute, minute and a half, and let Paul comment on it.
[01:32:15.894 --> 01:32:16.775]  We've got some other news.
[01:32:16.795 --> 01:32:24.803]  I'm going to take five more calls here in a second, and then we're going to get back into news for the rest of the hour, and come back and take about 15 calls in the third hour.
[01:32:25.829 --> 01:32:29.451]  But coming up this Thursday, Marshall Law sold out last week.
[01:32:30.012 --> 01:32:30.712]  I didn't know this.
[01:32:30.732 --> 01:32:33.694]  They had given me the small theater because they had so many new releases coming out.
[01:32:35.194 --> 01:32:36.735]  Only the 130 seat theater.
[01:32:37.716 --> 01:32:38.997]  So it sold out really quick.
[01:32:39.017 --> 01:32:40.537]  So one more showing and then that's it.
[01:32:41.018 --> 01:32:44.520]  Next Monday, 8 o'clock, Alamo Draft House.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.000]  Beautiful theater, South Lamar.
[01:32:46.601 --> 01:32:48.642]  Great food, you know, everything.
[01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.180]  Ice cream, you name it, though I'm not eating that.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:51.801]  I'm on a diet.
[01:32:52.861 --> 01:32:55.061]  And it's just a lot of fun.
[01:32:55.081 --> 01:32:58.942]  It'll be the last time I show martial law for a long period of time.
[01:32:59.823 --> 01:33:08.045]  And so go to InfoWars.com, link through to the Alamo Draft House website, DraftHouse.com, and go right through and get your tickets there online.
[01:33:08.105 --> 01:33:13.246]  Or if you live in Austin, or you have friends or family that do, and you're planning to come into town, just drive by South Lamar.
[01:33:13.286 --> 01:33:14.886]  They'll sell you the tickets right now at the door.
[01:33:14.926 --> 01:33:17.647]  Put them in your wallet or purse and have them for next Monday.
[01:33:18.782 --> 01:33:19.982]  And the tickets are going quick.
[01:33:20.182 --> 01:33:25.484]  Next Monday, last chance to see Martial Law coming up at the Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:33:26.264 --> 01:33:27.244]  What is Martial Law?
[01:33:27.724 --> 01:33:31.705]  Well, out of the ashes of the September 11 tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:33:32.125 --> 01:33:33.386]  The Constitution has been shredded.
[01:33:33.426 --> 01:33:34.746]  America is now a police state.
[01:33:35.126 --> 01:33:39.747]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:33:40.148 --> 01:33:45.829]  Learn the terrifying secret that holds the future of the world in its grasp from the front lines of the police state, the darkest sanctum,
[01:33:46.681 --> 01:33:55.283]  Of the secret society that controls it, Marshall Law reveals the master plan of a group hell-bent on capturing America today and tomorrow the world.
[01:33:55.683 --> 01:33:57.923]  The New World Order has set in motion the Fourth Reich.
[01:33:58.343 --> 01:34:02.864]  Marshall Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:34:03.204 --> 01:34:11.046]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into their own prison planet.
[01:34:12.532 --> 01:34:15.434]  Discover the Document of Truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:34:15.555 --> 01:34:18.017]  Three hours, literally a mini-series.
[01:34:19.438 --> 01:34:21.639]  Three hours long with the extras.
[01:34:21.679 --> 01:34:27.004]  Two and a half hours in the main section of the film itself that we'll be showing next week.
[01:34:28.345 --> 01:34:30.487]  Please get the film.
[01:34:31.127 --> 01:34:32.809]  Please make copies.
[01:34:33.029 --> 01:34:34.530]  It's having a huge effect.
[01:34:35.214 --> 01:34:37.217]  I put my life on the line to tell the truth.
[01:34:37.277 --> 01:34:41.123]  It is the most hardcore video when it comes to political truth you'll ever see.
[01:34:41.163 --> 01:34:48.694]  And we've got the reviews pouring in from activists, filmmakers, talk show hosts, without us even requesting a review saying that.
[01:34:49.922 --> 01:34:55.606]  It is my best work yet and it's available through InfoWars.com via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart.
[01:34:55.966 --> 01:34:57.947]  Go to our book and video store on the website.
[01:34:57.987 --> 01:34:59.628]  Look at all the different films and books we carry.
[01:35:00.048 --> 01:35:02.630]  All the discounts as much as 75% off.
[01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:06.132]  And some of these discounts we're offering on books and videos in different packages.
[01:35:06.892 --> 01:35:09.394]  Or call toll free and they can answer all your questions.
[01:35:09.414 --> 01:35:09.494]  1-888-253-3139-8888.
[01:35:19.579 --> 01:35:23.982]  3139, or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, my weekly TV reports.
[01:35:24.503 --> 01:35:27.185]  My TV show is pretty good, it's won Best of Austin, the Reader's Bowl.
[01:35:27.785 --> 01:35:42.595]  All of my films, a bunch of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, our best audio interviews, all there, $0.15 a day, $5.95 a month, which is $0.19 if you get a monthly subscription, $0.15 a day with a yearly subscription, basically three months free.
[01:35:43.877 --> 01:36:01.221]  We're now in our 15th month of having PrisonPlanet.TV, so it just gets bigger and better and a bunch of new features coming up in the next month that, believe me, just go ahead and get in on PrisonPlanet.TV and that makes it possible so I can pay my three webmasters, pay for my four servers.
[01:36:02.321 --> 01:36:07.322]  Literally, it's very expensive, folks, and we like Paul and others to be able to
[01:36:08.416 --> 01:36:14.620]  Well, Paul has actually made enough money now where he doesn't live in a gangland government housing.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:20.824]  He wasn't himself living in government housing, but he was living in the area with it and the burning cars outside his house at night.
[01:36:21.205 --> 01:36:26.508]  Paul was actually able, because I gave him a raise, thanks to you supporting us, to move out.
[01:36:26.888 --> 01:36:28.269]  Well, Paul, I hate to bring this up.
[01:36:28.289 --> 01:36:28.870]  Are you mad at me?
[01:36:29.130 --> 01:36:31.832]  I'm just trying to give folks an idea of why it's important to support us.
[01:36:31.892 --> 01:36:32.112]  Paul?
[01:36:33.442 --> 01:36:35.164]  No, I mean, that's exactly the case.
[01:36:35.584 --> 01:36:37.886]  It wasn't exactly the lap of luxury.
[01:36:37.906 --> 01:36:43.571]  I mean, I was happy to do it, obviously, because I mean, as you say, it doesn't even seem like work to me.
[01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:45.232]  It's just what I'd be doing anyway.
[01:36:45.873 --> 01:36:55.301]  So I'm grateful for it, and I'm grateful to the PrisonPlanet.TV members, you know, for them to keep throwing coal in the fire so we can continue and expand.
[01:36:56.482 --> 01:36:59.965]  Well, absolutely, but I mean, I got tired of hearing you talk about the burning cars.
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:04.933]  We've got areas like that here too, brother.
[01:37:06.064 --> 01:37:16.010]  But seriously, you know, despite the fact that the economy is in the dumps, as you know, our audience roughly doubles every year, the last four years in a row.
[01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:20.492]  Frankly, sales have not been as good as they were just a year ago, because the economy is in trouble.
[01:37:20.933 --> 01:37:28.737]  But that didn't stop me from giving all of my employees, I've got four employees, a raise a month ago, or two months ago, because the dollar has been devalued.
[01:37:29.197 --> 01:37:32.239]  That was another thing, Paul, the devaluation of the dollar, 40%,
[01:37:34.245 --> 01:37:37.208]  And you being paid in dollars, that wasn't very fun, was it?
[01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:42.793]  Oh no, because a dollar to the pound used to be about 70 pence.
[01:37:42.953 --> 01:37:48.498]  Now it's about 50 pence, 55 pence, so that's a big difference.
[01:37:48.679 --> 01:37:51.521]  So, yeah, I mean, it's something we have to deal with.
[01:37:51.581 --> 01:37:56.606]  Well, we're talking about the dollar rebounding, which I hope it does, but it's rebounded, what, from being down 43% now it's down 41% since 1998?
[01:38:01.418 --> 01:38:06.400]  To me, it's just a matter of pence as to what it is now to what it was a year ago, two years ago.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:08.922]  So, there's no way it's rebounded at all.
[01:38:10.642 --> 01:38:11.683]  Well, they tell us it has.
[01:38:11.703 --> 01:38:13.023]  I mean, it makes me very angry.
[01:38:13.063 --> 01:38:19.726]  The little bit of money I got in the bank for my children's college education, if they choose to go to college, is literally going to be worth nothing.
[01:38:19.846 --> 01:38:21.347]  I mean, it's just poultry.
[01:38:21.967 --> 01:38:25.528]  But again, folks, that's why it's so important we put out the best info.
[01:38:25.829 --> 01:38:26.689]  We work the hardest.
[01:38:27.370 --> 01:38:32.442]  I mean, Paul, a lot of nights, what, you get up about 10 in the morning usually and you work until about 2 or 3 at night.
[01:38:33.567 --> 01:38:34.867]  That's usually the case, yeah.
[01:38:35.067 --> 01:38:36.128]  Burning the midnight oil.
[01:38:36.388 --> 01:38:43.189]  I remember three years ago when I first hired you because I noticed you had great precision in cutting through propaganda and forecasting.
[01:38:43.749 --> 01:38:45.770]  I mean, it's not that you're a clone.
[01:38:46.190 --> 01:38:49.811]  What the New World Order does is they hire people that agree with them, that have their own vision.
[01:38:50.311 --> 01:38:52.572]  It's just a similar vision, that see things the way they see them.
[01:38:52.992 --> 01:38:55.212]  Well, it's not even a thing of control.
[01:38:55.572 --> 01:38:56.473]  Well, the same thing with Paul.
[01:38:56.513 --> 01:38:58.293]  I thought, man, this guy knows what he's talking about.
[01:38:59.479 --> 01:39:00.580]  I want to hire Paul Watson.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.761]  When I hired Paul, he was literally living on beans.
[01:39:04.662 --> 01:39:06.263]  So seriously, folks, you're really helping us.
[01:39:06.903 --> 01:39:11.165]  And if we do get more support, I'll get a bigger office so I can get maybe another employee.
[01:39:11.505 --> 01:39:13.386]  Right now, we're back to back in my tiny
[01:39:14.258 --> 01:39:14.578]  Not even.
[01:39:14.598 --> 01:39:17.839]  It's like 800 square foot office.
[01:39:18.259 --> 01:39:19.319]  We will get a bigger office.
[01:39:19.339 --> 01:39:24.241]  We will get a storefront on South Lamar instead of a mailbox on South Lamar.
[01:39:24.741 --> 01:39:28.582]  There is so much we'll do, but our overhead is gorgantuan.
[01:39:28.602 --> 01:39:30.503]  A $10,000 a month short way bill.
[01:39:32.443 --> 01:39:34.244]  Because we do that as a world service.
[01:39:34.665 --> 01:39:36.145]  We don't make any money off of it, frankly.
[01:39:36.686 --> 01:39:44.430]  It's mainly an international audience, but we do it because of the letters we get from Malaysia and Africa and Germany and Russia and Japan.
[01:39:45.371 --> 01:39:48.392]  We do it because of the letters we get from Antarctica.
[01:39:48.652 --> 01:39:49.913]  Paul, where do you get e-mails from?
[01:39:49.933 --> 01:39:52.915]  I get e-mails from all over the world.
[01:39:52.935 --> 01:39:58.378]  Sweden, all the European countries, even China occasionally if they ever get through.
[01:39:59.485 --> 01:40:04.868]  You know, in the light of Microsoft removing the words freedom from their products in China.
[01:40:05.288 --> 01:40:12.052]  So, it's amazing that it is an outreach and it's very successful that we can reach out to the whole world with this.
[01:40:12.993 --> 01:40:16.275]  Absolutely, and again folks, we need your support.
[01:40:16.795 --> 01:40:20.917]  Almost all the capital that comes in goes into the fight.
[01:40:21.137 --> 01:40:27.661]  I mean, a very small portion ever, you know, stays with Alex Jones so I can buy a new pair of shoes or whatever.
[01:40:28.405 --> 01:40:29.205]  We are here.
[01:40:29.225 --> 01:40:35.047]  I mean, you hear me on your local radio stations on at two in the morning as a guest, and then you hear me the next day on my own show.
[01:40:35.767 --> 01:40:38.468]  Paul is the same way, so we deserve your support and we need it.
[01:40:39.048 --> 01:40:40.488]  So, triple, and how do you support us?
[01:40:40.508 --> 01:40:42.069]  Just get to videos.
[01:40:42.089 --> 01:40:47.830]  1-888-253-3139 or infowars.com or prisonplanet.tv.
[01:40:48.090 --> 01:40:51.171]  Paul, I want to get these calls out of the way, but what's some of the other news you want to get into?
[01:40:53.132 --> 01:40:54.153]  Downing Street Memo.
[01:40:54.993 --> 01:40:56.814]  The neocons have responded.
[01:40:57.234 --> 01:40:59.675]  Wait till you hear Rush Limbaugh's comments on it.
[01:41:00.115 --> 01:41:04.157]  And how the establishment media have taken the opportunity to spin it.
[01:41:04.857 --> 01:41:07.038]  Now that these hoax allegations have arisen.
[01:41:07.959 --> 01:41:09.459]  And you were ahead of that yesterday.
[01:41:09.479 --> 01:41:11.220]  Now they're just not getting their talking points.
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:13.081]  They're ramping up on it, yeah.
[01:41:13.121 --> 01:41:17.983]  Rush Limbaugh mentioned it for the first time on his show late yesterday.
[01:41:18.883 --> 01:41:20.764]  So they're really jumping on the bandwagon now.
[01:41:21.894 --> 01:41:23.755]  All right, we'll talk about those tactics quickly.
[01:41:23.795 --> 01:41:24.716]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:41:25.176 --> 01:41:28.718]  Tim in Florida, then Anton, David, and many others.
[01:41:28.758 --> 01:41:29.899]  Go ahead, you're on the air, Tim.
[01:41:30.439 --> 01:41:30.839]  Hi, Alex.
[01:41:30.859 --> 01:41:33.041]  It's nice to have you and Paul on the line.
[01:41:33.421 --> 01:41:33.761]  Thank you.
[01:41:33.861 --> 01:41:48.170]  I know that you talk about, you know, when nobody calls in and disagrees with you on other radio shows and everything, and then I noticed that you were talking about, you know, your kids going to college and all that kind of stuff, but what I really want to know is, you know,
[01:41:48.962 --> 01:41:55.567]  I've heard you say a bunch of times that within the next 10 years that everyone, that 80% of us are going to be dead.
[01:41:56.047 --> 01:42:01.951]  So, how can you plan for the future if you think that the future is completely, you know, just, there is no future?
[01:42:02.011 --> 01:42:09.056]  Well, I think you're actually taking a little, you're actually warping or spinning more than just a bit with what you just said.
[01:42:09.496 --> 01:42:09.696]  No.
[01:42:09.836 --> 01:42:11.778]  I have said... I'm really not.
[01:42:11.798 --> 01:42:12.158]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:12.198 --> 01:42:13.219]  I don't want to cut you off.
[01:42:13.479 --> 01:42:13.999]  No, go ahead.
[01:42:14.700 --> 01:42:15.140]  I've heard it.
[01:42:17.037 --> 01:42:18.117]  I mean, I love y'all.
[01:42:18.337 --> 01:42:19.057]  I'm a big fan.
[01:42:19.078 --> 01:42:25.959]  I'm just saying that you have to bring some positivity to some people's lives.
[01:42:26.019 --> 01:42:28.280]  I know that we're in some serious times.
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:39.882]  But, you know, I think a lot of people that are on the fringe, and there's a lot of people that listen to you that are just pretty close to over the edge, that, you know, if they listen to your show every day, they might just go way over the edge.
[01:42:39.922 --> 01:42:40.403]  You know what I mean?
[01:42:40.423 --> 01:42:40.663]  Okay.
[01:42:40.763 --> 01:42:43.163]  Well, let me just respond to what you said, please.
[01:42:43.583 --> 01:42:44.123]  Uh-huh.
[01:42:44.143 --> 01:42:44.764]  Tim, look.
[01:42:48.536 --> 01:42:53.398]  I mean, how do I... Number one, I have not said any percent of us are all going to be dead in ten years.
[01:42:53.979 --> 01:43:14.869]  What I have said is that within ten years the control grid will fully be in place and that if we don't expose who's behind the terror, and if we don't fight the National ID cards, and if we don't fight and defeat the EU and the free trade area of the Americas, that then they'll have the straitjacket in place to start carrying out massive biological attacks
[01:43:15.229 --> 01:43:16.210]  That's exactly right.
[01:43:16.230 --> 01:43:19.132]  Prince Philip, people like that have said we want an 80% population reduction.
[01:43:42.463 --> 01:43:43.244]  Certainly.
[01:43:43.604 --> 01:43:44.344]  I'm confident.
[01:43:44.424 --> 01:43:49.448]  I believe we've been given that stay of execution because of the backlash against this movement.
[01:43:50.829 --> 01:43:54.111]  But, as you said, if we do take our eye off the ball, that's what they want.
[01:43:54.151 --> 01:43:55.252]  That's what they'll run through.
[01:43:55.272 --> 01:43:56.272]  Yeah, you know something?
[01:43:56.753 --> 01:43:57.613]  This is important, Tim.
[01:43:57.633 --> 01:43:59.695]  I get these calls and emails all the time.
[01:43:59.735 --> 01:44:02.036]  Well, Alex, you must be the most paranoid person on earth.
[01:44:02.576 --> 01:44:04.578]  A paranoid person hides out in their house.
[01:44:05.203 --> 01:44:16.279]  A paranoid person isn't out at public events, isn't sneaking into elite encampments, isn't going into the Republican National Convention, isn't being arrested by police at protest.
[01:44:17.603 --> 01:44:18.344]  I am upbeat.
[01:44:18.504 --> 01:44:19.565]  I'm saying we're winning.
[01:44:19.585 --> 01:44:23.910]  I mean, you just said I'm not being upbeat, but then I say everybody I talk to is waking up and we're winning.
[01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:25.692]  We're having an effect, sir.
[01:44:25.732 --> 01:44:26.573]  We're in the fight.
[01:44:26.813 --> 01:44:29.636]  But we've got to admit to ourselves just how bad this is.
[01:44:30.356 --> 01:44:31.998]  I didn't say they're going to kill 80% of us.
[01:44:32.419 --> 01:44:35.562]  I said that's their plan, and they will do it if we let them.
[01:44:35.882 --> 01:44:36.822]  No, I mean, I've heard it.
[01:44:36.882 --> 01:44:43.905]  I've heard the cage is dropping, there's plans to eliminate 80% of us in the next 10 years, in the next decade.
[01:44:44.245 --> 01:44:49.047]  What I'm saying is, think about like 1993, because I've been in this about as long as you.
[01:44:49.608 --> 01:44:51.848]  Think about the 90s, coming up to 2000.
[01:44:51.928 --> 01:44:58.891]  I remember in the 90s, they're going to put transponders in your cars, they're going to put thumb scanners in, they're going to get rid of the borders, they're going to have millions of illegal aliens.
[01:44:58.931 --> 01:44:59.912]  It's all happened, brother!
[01:45:00.252 --> 01:45:03.253]  No, I mean, but then there's people like Anthony Hilder that say,
[01:45:03.769 --> 01:45:09.390]  Listen, by the year 2000, we're all going to be slaves, and then you got people that are kind of crazy that move out in the woods.
[01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:10.091]  You know what I mean?
[01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:14.252]  Sir, sir, sir, I can't be responsible for what Anthony Hilder said.
[01:45:14.332 --> 01:45:15.992]  Anthony Hilder, and thanks for the call, Jim.
[01:45:16.192 --> 01:45:17.232]  I've got to be fair to the other callers.
[01:45:17.732 --> 01:45:25.914]  Back in the 1960s, mid and late 1960s, this guy was putting out records called the Illuminati.
[01:45:26.354 --> 01:45:28.435]  This guy literally wrote the book
[01:45:29.396 --> 01:45:30.497]  On the New World Order.
[01:45:30.658 --> 01:45:37.844]  I may not agree with some of the... He was reading their documents where they said 30 years ago, by 2000 we've got to have the three unions.
[01:45:37.864 --> 01:45:38.745]  This is all published.
[01:45:39.205 --> 01:45:41.608]  By 2000 we want to have our population reductions.
[01:45:41.928 --> 01:45:43.449]  Kissinger said that in 1973.
[01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:48.634]  We have his documents saying sterilize happier women for the third world countries.
[01:45:49.054 --> 01:45:50.916]  They're five years behind.
[01:45:51.277 --> 01:45:54.239]  And the more they get behind... We talk about this every day, sir.
[01:45:54.660 --> 01:45:54.880]  Paul?
[01:45:56.113 --> 01:45:59.334]  It's the barometer of our success that they are behind.
[01:45:59.514 --> 01:46:01.174]  I mean, it's a game of brinksmanship.
[01:46:01.595 --> 01:46:06.676]  People get downbeat about how it's such a leviathan and we can't have any effect, any influence.
[01:46:07.096 --> 01:46:08.457]  We are having an influence.
[01:46:08.577 --> 01:46:16.779]  We're pushing them back day by day, which is why we've had such a rash of these whistleblowers coming out and backing us up and saying the same thing.
[01:46:17.319 --> 01:46:21.762]  You know Paul, I think the gist of what the caller was saying is this is too scary, you're turning people off.
[01:46:38.054 --> 01:46:39.395]  Uh, you know, you're going too far.
[01:46:39.856 --> 01:46:43.818]  Folks, I was on the air ten years ago telling you they're putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[01:46:44.159 --> 01:46:46.140]  Telling you the mercury's brain-damaging the children.
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:51.123]  Now it's all over the news, Congress is saying it, and now you're an evil liberal if you say it.
[01:46:51.584 --> 01:46:54.426]  Well, no, the Bill Clintons of the world are pushing it.
[01:46:54.746 --> 01:46:57.508]  You know, I talked about how they openly were selling AIDS blood.
[01:46:58.108 --> 01:46:59.249]  Tens of thousands died.
[01:46:59.309 --> 01:47:01.090]  I mean, I'm sorry they're so ruthless!
[01:47:01.170 --> 01:47:01.811]  I'm sorry!
[01:47:02.131 --> 01:47:04.233]  Listen, I'm gonna be honest.
[01:47:04.513 --> 01:47:06.074]  People want to know what's in my heart and guts.
[01:47:07.245 --> 01:47:12.790]  I normally have this intense courage, this intense, just blind devotion to fighting the New World Order.
[01:47:13.490 --> 01:47:25.240]  I don't think about myself, but every once in a while, I'll wake up in a cold sweat, you know, when I wasn't consciously guarding against fear, and just get up, sweating, and go, my gosh, I'm actually fighting pure tyranny.
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:29.503]  These people are psychotic killers, and I get a chill, and then God just comforts me.
[01:47:29.763 --> 01:47:31.565]  Literally, as the Bible says, His comforter comes.
[01:47:31.945 --> 01:47:32.766]  But folks, I mean,
[01:47:33.286 --> 01:47:33.866]  You know what?
[01:47:34.447 --> 01:47:37.348]  It isn't going to go away if you just rationalize and make excuses.
[01:47:37.869 --> 01:47:38.129]  Okay?
[01:47:38.169 --> 01:47:42.231]  I mean, this weekend, I was awake and the fear hit me.
[01:47:42.611 --> 01:47:44.512]  And it was just, it was powerful.
[01:47:45.112 --> 01:47:47.153]  And I just said, man, this is incredible.
[01:47:47.213 --> 01:47:48.334]  But, you know what?
[01:47:48.394 --> 01:47:50.255]  We've just got to get over it, folks.
[01:47:50.375 --> 01:47:51.015]  I'm sorry.
[01:47:51.256 --> 01:47:53.457]  Look, we know what we're talking about, Paul.
[01:47:54.437 --> 01:47:56.178]  This is the old cancer analogy.
[01:47:56.198 --> 01:47:59.220]  If your doctor knows you have cancer, would you want him to tell you?
[01:47:59.480 --> 01:48:01.361]  Or would you just want to live in blind ignorance?
[01:48:02.461 --> 01:48:02.841]  That's right.
[01:48:02.861 --> 01:48:04.323]  We've got cancer as a society.
[01:48:04.383 --> 01:48:05.423]  Our souls have cancer.
[01:48:06.404 --> 01:48:10.167]  And, uh, I mean, Paul, do you ever get seized by fear?
[01:48:10.187 --> 01:48:12.349]  Yeah, all the time.
[01:48:12.389 --> 01:48:15.992]  I mean, it happened yesterday when you were talking to David Ray Griffin.
[01:48:16.473 --> 01:48:20.035]  Just the overwhelming evidence of 9-11 being an inside job.
[01:48:20.556 --> 01:48:25.460]  Sometimes those rationalizations do try and, you know, creep in and it is fear to think, well,
[01:48:26.187 --> 01:48:38.356]  Maybe they weren't behind it and then you're face-to-face with the evidence and it's clear they were and you have to confront it and your own subconscious sometimes tells you not to because of that self-defense mechanism but it's there in your face and you've got to face it.
[01:48:40.877 --> 01:48:45.741]  Yeah, I uh... You know, I'm more afraid of them getting what they want.
[01:48:46.942 --> 01:48:48.823]  You know, and we've been so conditioned, Paul.
[01:48:49.703 --> 01:48:53.526]  I mean, look, everything we said ten years ago that was going to happen, happened.
[01:48:54.107 --> 01:48:54.687]  I'm on record.
[01:48:56.065 --> 01:48:59.709]  And, I mean, now they're doing it all in front of us and people are still trying to deny?
[01:48:59.729 --> 01:49:01.991]  Oh, man.
[01:49:02.291 --> 01:49:03.192]  That's what I'm afraid of.
[01:49:03.812 --> 01:49:07.676]  I just... Folks, it's not even really fear.
[01:49:07.716 --> 01:49:08.717]  It's like nausea.
[01:49:09.358 --> 01:49:14.582]  It's like... It's like being around a bunch of rotten meat or rotten garbage.
[01:49:14.602 --> 01:49:15.663]  You just want to get out of there.
[01:49:17.165 --> 01:49:19.407]  I don't want to admit this is true, but folks, it is.
[01:49:21.761 --> 01:49:34.425]  Well, I mean, when I first heard Alex Jones, the very first radio show I heard was Alex Jones talking about how they were going to use terrorism to enact their plans, a police state and a global empire.
[01:49:34.885 --> 01:49:36.826]  That was June, July 2001.
[01:49:36.866 --> 01:49:39.107]  We all know what happened two months later.
[01:49:39.587 --> 01:49:45.389]  So that told me that Alex Jones was fairly accurate in what he was saying and the warnings he was putting out.
[01:49:47.404 --> 01:49:48.884]  You know, I'm not worried about myself.
[01:49:48.964 --> 01:49:49.945]  It's just the little ones.
[01:49:50.385 --> 01:49:52.565]  We owe it to the little ones to defend them.
[01:49:52.585 --> 01:50:02.868]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:03.128 --> 01:50:07.869]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:08.089 --> 01:50:13.731]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.971 --> 01:50:18.513]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:18.734 --> 01:50:25.877]  The casual society control grid, impenetrable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.897 --> 01:50:26.698]  soil, the U.S.A.
[01:50:26.718 --> 01:50:30.400]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.101]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:33.341 --> 01:50:40.045]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:40.285 --> 01:50:45.552]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:45.572 --> 01:50:45.992]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:54.565 --> 01:50:59.790]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:59.930 --> 01:51:08.039]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:08.279 --> 01:51:15.346]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:16.287 --> 01:51:22.772]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.952 --> 01:51:28.056]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:28.156 --> 01:51:37.044]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:37.304 --> 01:51:40.606]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:25.115 --> 01:52:28.219]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[01:52:28.399 --> 01:52:28.919]  I think so.
[01:52:54.806 --> 01:53:00.489]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.151 --> 01:53:16.378]  Paul, we need, I said this months ago and I know you've been busy, but we need to create a population control reduction area and get the Kissinger documents, get the Prince Philip documents.
[01:53:17.238 --> 01:53:19.480]  I mean, go to the library, don't just have the quotes.
[01:53:19.500 --> 01:53:23.622]  We need to get If I Was an Animal and get his 89 book and scan the pages in.
[01:53:24.693 --> 01:53:28.715]  That's why when I get a bigger office, I'll be able to have interns and volunteers and folks who want to do stuff like that.
[01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:31.896]  Or you can just do it and fax it to us, email it to us, the scans.
[01:53:33.657 --> 01:53:40.880]  And get all these different vaccine foundations' own quotes about eugenics and really show that history to people that don't get it.
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:44.121]  I mean, we posted all those articles, but they're all over the sites.
[01:53:46.282 --> 01:53:49.503]  I mean, the globalists are in control because they are the social architects.
[01:53:49.523 --> 01:53:50.864]  They're in the controlling society.
[01:53:52.012 --> 01:53:53.414]  And, I mean, this is what they talk about.
[01:53:53.434 --> 01:53:54.175]  This is what they do.
[01:53:54.215 --> 01:53:56.076]  This is what eugenics and bioethics is.
[01:53:57.938 --> 01:54:07.368]  And, um, you know, the sick thing is every time we have a victory and we're holding them back, people then go, oh, well, you know, look, the EU's having trouble now.
[01:54:07.388 --> 01:54:08.669]  Look at these guys.
[01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:09.690]  Yeah, let's fight it.
[01:54:10.151 --> 01:54:12.894]  We've educated people, dude, and they're still trying to ram it through.
[01:54:15.038 --> 01:54:17.419]  I mean, you know, oh, the National ID card didn't exist?
[01:54:17.439 --> 01:54:18.299]  Well, now they passed it.
[01:54:18.339 --> 01:54:19.159]  We lost that one.
[01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:20.860]  Now we're fighting at the state level.
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:22.420]  Look, we don't give up, folks.
[01:54:23.581 --> 01:54:26.502]  We're like, to use an analogy, we're like a bunch of piranhas.
[01:54:26.762 --> 01:54:29.943]  The New World Order is a big fat hog that just walked into our water.
[01:54:30.503 --> 01:54:33.284]  And we can stand around and go, I can't eat that whole hog, it's too big.
[01:54:33.304 --> 01:54:36.045]  But all of us together, we can end this hog's day.
[01:54:37.966 --> 01:54:39.066]  Piranha attack!
[01:54:39.798 --> 01:54:44.999]  Just stop worrying about the consequences, or what's going to happen, or are you going to win, or is it too big?
[01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:49.761]  Anybody will tell you in military strategy for the ground pounders, don't worry about that.
[01:54:49.781 --> 01:54:50.241]  Just hit them.
[01:54:50.841 --> 01:54:53.502]  If you've got the initiative and the moral authority, you're not going to lose.
[01:54:54.902 --> 01:54:56.662]  You can be outnumbered ten to one, folks.
[01:54:56.702 --> 01:55:00.723]  If you've got the initiative and the moral authority, you cannot be defeated!
[01:55:02.404 --> 01:55:02.784]  Alright.
[01:55:03.553 --> 01:55:04.973]  They don't have the moral authority!
[01:55:04.993 --> 01:55:17.157]  They're a bunch of inbred, greedy people, they're a bunch of scared people, they're a bunch of control freaks, and they got a bunch of brainwashed, hyped-up minions serving them, and all they gotta do is wake those minions up!
[01:55:17.877 --> 01:55:20.057]  They abuse their minions even more than they abuse us!
[01:55:21.878 --> 01:55:25.639]  Their minions are being deprogrammed so fast they can't even make them quick enough!
[01:55:31.011 --> 01:55:32.373]  I'm walking point here, folks.
[01:55:32.393 --> 01:55:35.195]  The least you can do is stop sucking your thumbs and get involved in the fight.
[01:55:36.096 --> 01:55:38.759]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Anton in Texas.
[01:55:38.819 --> 01:55:39.580]  Anton, you're on the air.
[01:55:39.620 --> 01:55:39.980]  Go ahead.
[01:55:40.681 --> 01:55:41.382]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:55:41.742 --> 01:55:42.042]  Fine.
[01:55:42.763 --> 01:55:43.043]  Great.
[01:55:43.344 --> 01:55:52.653]  Man, the last caller was looking for an upside to our battle on the New World Order, and I think the fact that it was ten years ago that Anthony Hilder said that
[01:55:53.106 --> 01:55:55.728]  You know, we would all be slaves, and we fought that off.
[01:55:55.948 --> 01:55:57.610]  I think that is an upside to look at.
[01:55:57.870 --> 01:55:59.571]  Well, we have lost a lot of our freedoms.
[01:55:59.591 --> 01:56:04.575]  You know, they're trying to kick us all the way down the hole, and we're like on a ledge 50 feet down, hanging on.
[01:56:05.596 --> 01:56:08.278]  Exactly, and we just need to charter and faster.
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:15.905]  The one question I had was about Mohawk, and a lot of the people listening now won't know exactly what we're talking about.
[01:56:15.925 --> 01:56:17.266]  The Frost Building downtown
[01:56:18.041 --> 01:56:19.481]  Really resembles an owl.
[01:56:19.762 --> 01:56:23.783]  And I wanted to know if you knew any... It has two gigantic owl eyes.
[01:56:24.983 --> 01:56:27.224]  And you can see it from everywhere in town.
[01:56:27.304 --> 01:56:29.485]  It's like Big Brother, you know, staring right at you.
[01:56:30.165 --> 01:56:34.646]  And I was wondering if you knew if any of the architects were, you know, Bohemian Grovers or anything like that.
[01:56:35.426 --> 01:56:39.248]  I know the architect was asked at the grand opening if it was supposed to be an owl.
[01:56:39.268 --> 01:56:40.668]  And he said, yeah, it looks like one, doesn't it?
[01:56:42.597 --> 01:56:43.537]  But I mean, let me just finish.
[01:56:43.878 --> 01:56:45.918]  All the biggest buildings are always bank buildings.
[01:56:45.958 --> 01:56:47.419]  We've had major professors on.
[01:56:47.439 --> 01:56:53.881]  It's been all over the AP, all over Canadian papers that they build big buildings as religious monuments.
[01:56:53.961 --> 01:56:54.702]  It's masonic.
[01:56:55.022 --> 01:56:56.322]  Paul Watson, tell them about it.
[01:56:57.443 --> 01:57:00.724]  Well yeah, that was heavily featured in that show you did for Sky One.
[01:57:01.528 --> 01:57:07.751]  Um, conspiracies, where that footage is there, where you go downtown and show them the building.
[01:57:08.531 --> 01:57:11.093]  And as you mentioned, it's totems of power.
[01:57:11.673 --> 01:57:19.837]  They like to have a physical example of their power in a kind of nebulous world, so they like to have a symbol, something that it's done for.
[01:57:19.917 --> 01:57:23.258]  Yeah, I mean, an analogy in popular culture is the Chronicles of Riddick.
[01:57:24.079 --> 01:57:29.001]  You know, where they drop their big, uh, you know, their big figurehead on the planets they've conquered.
[01:57:29.850 --> 01:57:31.293]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:31.313 --> 01:57:31.794]  Stay with us.
[01:57:34.439 --> 01:57:39.348]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:51.103 --> 01:57:51.743]  Big Brother.
[01:57:52.403 --> 01:57:53.464]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:54.164 --> 01:57:55.344]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.925 --> 01:57:56.765]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.505 --> 01:57:59.026]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:59.086 --> 01:58:02.727]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:03.248 --> 01:58:07.389]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.752 --> 01:58:18.694]  Just as the kings of old would build monuments,
[01:58:20.265 --> 01:58:21.246]  Symbols of power.
[01:58:21.586 --> 01:58:23.087]  Pyramids for their empires.
[01:58:23.167 --> 01:58:23.728]  Acropolis.
[01:58:24.508 --> 01:58:29.813]  The globalists of today build modern buildings openly as temples to their power.
[01:58:29.833 --> 01:58:32.975]  And that's even again in the Associated Press a month and a half ago.
[01:58:32.995 --> 01:58:34.897]  They're really throwing it in our face now.
[01:58:34.917 --> 01:58:35.978]  A caller just brought that up.
[01:58:36.358 --> 01:58:37.179]  End of the third hour.
[01:58:37.279 --> 01:58:39.240]  A ton of news coming up in this hour and your calls.
[01:58:39.521 --> 01:58:41.282]  Let's get some more of these calls out of the way.
[01:58:41.382 --> 01:58:42.763]  David in Delaware, you're on the air.
[01:58:42.783 --> 01:58:43.183]  Go ahead.
[01:58:43.484 --> 01:58:44.585]  Alex, how are you, sir?
[01:58:44.765 --> 01:58:44.965]  Good.
[01:58:45.416 --> 01:58:46.897]  Hey, Alex, I have three points.
[01:58:47.057 --> 01:58:50.458]  One of them is, start with, did you get the pictures that I sent to you?
[01:58:50.798 --> 01:58:57.161]  They received it at your office, the 13th, in reference to the seatbelt checkpoints here in Delaware.
[01:58:57.241 --> 01:58:57.761]  Yes, I did.
[01:58:57.801 --> 01:58:58.182]  Thank you.
[01:58:58.342 --> 01:58:58.762]  Thank you.
[01:58:59.402 --> 01:59:03.064]  Okay, the other issue... Which is a federal initiative to federalize the roads.
[01:59:03.084 --> 01:59:04.344]  It has nothing to do with seatbelts.
[01:59:04.765 --> 01:59:05.225]  That's right.
[01:59:05.345 --> 01:59:05.745]  Exactly.
[01:59:06.745 --> 01:59:14.769]  Another thing is, if we put God at first, if we are determined to do what's right in life,
[01:59:15.478 --> 01:59:17.640]  We can defeat anybody.
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.423]  Back in 84, I was with the American Party headquarters.
[01:59:21.463 --> 01:59:23.004]  We were raided in Delaware.
[01:59:23.644 --> 01:59:29.809]  Allen Stang played a recording that what happened in Delaware was not in Moscow, but it was in Delaware.
[01:59:29.829 --> 01:59:30.690]  The raid.
[01:59:31.490 --> 01:59:33.692]  And also, I have a library.
[01:59:34.332 --> 01:59:37.195]  Right now, I'm getting ready to go for my fourth library.
[01:59:37.775 --> 01:59:38.916]  I have your videos.
[01:59:40.162 --> 01:59:44.764]  Text bars and a power hour that will be in all three or four libraries.
[01:59:44.884 --> 01:59:48.705]  And if everybody did what you are doing right now, it would wake up tens of thousands more.
[01:59:49.085 --> 01:59:50.085]  It's so important.
[01:59:50.245 --> 01:59:50.846]  Paul Watson?
[01:59:52.206 --> 02:00:06.811]  Well, on the checkpoints issue, there's an article out today, which is on prisonplanet.com, where the main civil liberties union is complaining about checkpoints in Portland, in a place called Old Town.
[02:00:08.743 --> 02:00:16.908]  The Border Patrol argued that the law gives them the right to set up checkpoints anytime within 100 miles of the border.
[02:00:18.429 --> 02:00:24.833]  And the Civil Limits Union are complaining that they're stopping regular Americans violating the Fourth Amendment.
[02:00:25.373 --> 02:00:37.701]  The fact is that using the border as a justification falls flat on its face when the Border Patrol were ordered not to arrest illegals during the Minutemen Vigil Patrol.
[02:00:38.504 --> 02:00:47.326]  So they will use those kind of laws to say we're just protecting the border, when in fact they go 100 miles into the state and stop regular Americans.
[02:00:47.366 --> 02:00:52.507]  Well, I'm about 150 miles or more from the border where I sit.
[02:00:52.887 --> 02:00:56.508]  We have Border Patrol driving around here, pulling over black people.
[02:00:57.488 --> 02:01:02.410]  I mean, I know folks, white people, Hispanics, you name it.
[02:01:02.710 --> 02:01:07.971]  But again, they give them jobs that burn up all their energy and their time, instead of being on the border.
[02:01:09.421 --> 02:01:11.822]  Or I'll tell them where to find the illegal aliens, raid Walmart.
[02:01:14.203 --> 02:01:15.044]  Anything else, caller?
[02:01:15.524 --> 02:01:16.705]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:01:17.045 --> 02:01:23.268]  You mentioned when I spoke to you before, are those pictures going to be put on the website like you said they were?
[02:01:23.288 --> 02:01:24.048]  Yeah, we'll try to.
[02:01:24.088 --> 02:01:26.129]  We're literally overwhelmed, but we're trying, sir.
[02:01:26.429 --> 02:01:28.250]  Yes, sir, that was in Harrington, Delaware.
[02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:29.251]  Alright, thank you.
[02:01:29.331 --> 02:01:31.352]  I appreciate the call and what you're doing.
[02:01:32.172 --> 02:01:33.012]  Up next here is
[02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:36.311]  Jamie in Kentucky.
[02:01:36.331 --> 02:01:36.951]  Go ahead, Jamie.
[02:01:37.331 --> 02:01:38.712]  Oh, Mr. Alex.
[02:01:39.092 --> 02:01:39.472]  Hi!
[02:01:39.873 --> 02:01:40.653]  How you doing, Paul?
[02:01:42.174 --> 02:01:42.814]  Paul's doing good.
[02:01:42.834 --> 02:01:43.395]  What's on your mind?
[02:01:43.955 --> 02:01:56.742]  Oh, I was at the library yesterday, and I read off some... I was on Infowars.com, and it says right here, Leading Egyptian Government Daily Al-Kabar.
[02:01:58.223 --> 02:01:59.564]  Al-Kazari is
[02:02:00.541 --> 02:02:01.822]  An American agent?
[02:02:02.123 --> 02:02:05.947]  Yeah, which we've always known, but we're going to talk about that after the break, yeah.
[02:02:06.447 --> 02:02:18.820]  Yeah, and another thing, I was on there yesterday and it had this little thing, if you're part of the government, and if you want real money, click on this, and I tried to click on it and it didn't do nothing.
[02:02:19.901 --> 02:02:22.544]  Well that might just be something in the browser at the library.
[02:02:22.564 --> 02:02:23.805]  At the library?
[02:02:24.925 --> 02:02:25.445]  Okay, thank you.
[02:02:25.645 --> 02:02:26.286]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:26.366 --> 02:02:27.886]  Glad you're visiting on the websites.
[02:02:28.046 --> 02:02:29.687]  We'll be right back after this quick break.
[02:02:29.707 --> 02:02:35.810]  Take a few more calls, then get into the news, then back into your calls with our guest, riding shotgun with us every two weeks, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:02:35.850 --> 02:02:36.570]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:02:36.590 --> 02:02:42.772]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:43.053 --> 02:02:43.873]  Check them out today.
[02:02:47.515 --> 02:02:50.376]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.616 --> 02:02:52.197]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:52.537 --> 02:02:57.219]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:57.559 --> 02:03:02.001]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:02.421 --> 02:03:06.623]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.

[02:03:47.978 --> 02:03:49.019]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:49.339 --> 02:03:52.122]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?

[02:03:58.128 --> 02:04:02.733]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:03.193 --> 02:04:05.335]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:04:48.879 --> 02:04:52.722]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:53.022 --> 02:04:53.843]  Read the labels.
[02:04:54.283 --> 02:04:58.406]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:58.627 --> 02:05:02.810]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:03.190 --> 02:05:08.074]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[02:05:36.191 --> 02:05:37.051]  Mainstream Media.
[02:05:53.831 --> 02:05:58.796]  I know that for a lot of you, your defense mechanisms kick in.
[02:06:13.917 --> 02:06:22.700]  You don't want to believe what we're facing as a society, as a species, but really, if you know human history, it's a repeat of everything we've seen over and over again.
[02:06:23.180 --> 02:06:24.540]  Tyranny is the norm.
[02:06:24.981 --> 02:06:33.203]  Liberty and human dignity and freedom is the incredibly rare jewel, the finest and most precious of commodities.
[02:06:34.924 --> 02:06:39.105]  And we are entering a very decadent, dangerous, corrupt society.
[02:06:39.485 --> 02:06:42.346]  You know, with decadence comes corruption and comes enslavement.
[02:06:45.373 --> 02:06:49.094]  Only an upright moral society will stand up against evil.
[02:06:49.675 --> 02:06:50.555]  History has shown that.
[02:06:51.295 --> 02:06:55.717]  We are a very soft, decadent, deluded society, and it's time to say no to it.
[02:06:56.038 --> 02:06:58.419]  We're going to take one more call to get in the news with Paul Watson.
[02:06:58.779 --> 02:06:59.819]  Cheryl in Ohio.
[02:06:59.839 --> 02:07:00.820]  You're on the air, Cheryl.
[02:07:01.260 --> 02:07:02.300]  Yes.
[02:07:02.421 --> 02:07:08.203]  You had mentioned in the beginning of your program about farming out body parts and bodies?
[02:07:08.884 --> 02:07:09.104]  Yes.
[02:07:10.359 --> 02:07:13.240]  Cleveland Science Center, they have a gig going on.
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:14.381]  It's called Body Works.
[02:07:14.461 --> 02:07:15.181]  Have you heard of it?
[02:07:15.581 --> 02:07:15.821]  No.
[02:07:15.841 --> 02:07:19.362]  Okay, it's a doctor who comes from Europe.
[02:07:20.303 --> 02:07:22.824]  And you can donate your body after you die.
[02:07:23.564 --> 02:07:29.306]  And so on display, they have human bodies all the way down to the muscle.
[02:07:29.346 --> 02:07:30.546]  The insides are gone.
[02:07:33.007 --> 02:07:34.228]  And you get the rest of the picture.
[02:07:34.248 --> 02:07:37.229]  Well, I mean, that's medical research and
[02:07:38.438 --> 02:07:41.600]  My grandfather gave his body to science.
[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:43.761]  His mother gave her body to science.
[02:07:44.262 --> 02:07:46.003]  My great-grandmother gave her body to science.
[02:07:46.023 --> 02:07:48.644]  That's a very admirable thing they did.
[02:07:48.704 --> 02:07:53.347]  The problem is the bodies are not treated with respect, in many cases, as they're supposed to.
[02:07:53.367 --> 02:07:54.027]  These are not.
[02:07:54.328 --> 02:07:55.808]  These are not.
[02:07:55.828 --> 02:08:07.075]  And anybody who, if this tours in Texas, I would challenge you to go and see it and see how diabolical
[02:08:08.206 --> 02:08:08.886]  It really is.
[02:08:10.347 --> 02:08:12.448]  Well, yeah, I don't think they should be selling tickets to it.
[02:08:12.468 --> 02:08:21.191]  That should only be people who've taken a Hippocratic Oath, which they don't even give anymore, and sworn to respect the bodies, and it'll get your respect real quick.
[02:08:21.231 --> 02:08:33.255]  I've talked to a lot of doctors, and they open one of those cases up in formaldehyde and let you know how transitory life is, and you start, you know, articulating a dead body, but that's already been dissected.
[02:08:33.495 --> 02:08:36.916]  Check out the Cleveland Science Center.
[02:08:38.913 --> 02:08:40.414]  And see what's going on there.
[02:08:40.434 --> 02:08:43.876]  I forget this doctor's name, but he looks pretty diabolical in and of himself.
[02:08:43.896 --> 02:08:51.641]  Well, Cheryl, what we brought up was the American Medical Association and others pushing to take our organs without asking.
[02:08:51.661 --> 02:08:52.581]  And that's a big problem.
[02:08:52.601 --> 02:08:53.402]  It's our property.
[02:08:53.422 --> 02:08:54.622]  Don't be a donor.
[02:08:54.943 --> 02:08:56.203]  Don't sign the donor.
[02:08:56.263 --> 02:08:58.245]  They're talking about just taking it.
[02:08:58.325 --> 02:08:58.665]  Period.
[02:08:59.105 --> 02:09:02.127]  Well, when you die, then, you know, I look at it like this.
[02:09:02.667 --> 02:09:05.489]  They can do something to our bodies, but they can't take our souls.
[02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:06.069]  That's right.
[02:09:06.089 --> 02:09:06.670]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:07.751 --> 02:09:09.052]  Well, they can take our souls.
[02:09:09.092 --> 02:09:10.873]  They traffic in the souls of men if we let them.
[02:09:12.494 --> 02:09:20.239]  Watching shows like 24 and rooting for Keither Sutherland as he tortures people to death.
[02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:22.701]  You're simulating marrying a serial killer.
[02:09:23.061 --> 02:09:24.362]  Oh, but it's for good reasons.
[02:09:24.582 --> 02:09:28.825]  You're bathing yourself in the deepest, darkest perversions.
[02:09:29.385 --> 02:09:34.808]  Listening to Rush Limbaugh and rooting and cheering the torture, again, takes your soul.
[02:09:34.869 --> 02:09:35.429]  Paul Watson?
[02:09:36.799 --> 02:09:43.941]  Well, it's interesting with the 24 thing, because I think they received a lot of criticism and kind of changed the plot line.
[02:09:43.961 --> 02:09:45.841]  Oh, I know, they even got mainstream criticism.
[02:09:45.881 --> 02:09:46.101]  Go ahead.
[02:09:46.121 --> 02:09:52.443]  Because the one I watched a few weeks ago, they needed to get information out of the Chinese guy.
[02:09:52.463 --> 02:09:53.563]  They didn't torture him.
[02:09:53.623 --> 02:09:56.164]  He asked them to give him medical assistance.
[02:09:56.224 --> 02:09:59.264]  So they were giving him something and he would spill the beans.
[02:09:59.364 --> 02:10:01.785]  So I think they've changed it to some extent.
[02:10:02.678 --> 02:10:06.099]  Um, the thing she was talking about was basically a freak show.
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:09.021]  It received major attention in Britain two years ago.
[02:10:09.601 --> 02:10:11.782]  Um, the guy got the nickname Dr. Death.
[02:10:12.162 --> 02:10:15.983]  Oh, you're talking about that guy from, uh, one of the Nordic companies, Germany?
[02:10:16.323 --> 02:10:16.964]  Germany, yeah.
[02:10:17.004 --> 02:10:18.684]  Yeah, he's parade... Oh, that's disgusting.
[02:10:18.704 --> 02:10:19.264]  She's right.
[02:10:19.625 --> 02:10:22.326]  They got dead horses, dead cows, vivisected humans.
[02:10:22.606 --> 02:10:28.788]  Oh no, that's totally disrespectful, totally degenerate, and it really, it is obscene and should be illegal.
[02:10:30.369 --> 02:10:30.889]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:31.784 --> 02:10:33.426]  Yeah, they were selling tickets for it.
[02:10:33.466 --> 02:10:36.629]  They had prime time shows on Channel 4 in Britain.
[02:10:36.669 --> 02:10:41.494]  Yeah, by the way, those people gave their bodies believing it was for science, and that swine bag got them.
[02:10:41.755 --> 02:10:42.715]  And that's fraud.
[02:10:44.597 --> 02:10:49.783]  Imagine going to one of these things and seeing your dead grandmother, who thought she was helping people.
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:56.466]  Yeah, there were calls to arrest the guy at one point, but he got away with it and made a lot of money in the process.
[02:10:56.566 --> 02:10:58.288]  That's right, and then he had a big showing in London.
[02:10:58.768 --> 02:10:58.949]  Yeah.
[02:10:59.049 --> 02:11:03.253]  I thought it was some US medical center doing it as a teaching guide.
[02:11:05.195 --> 02:11:06.597]  Okay, I didn't know it was that same guy.
[02:11:08.379 --> 02:11:10.401]  Oh God, if you folks have seen the photos of this.
[02:11:11.002 --> 02:11:12.784]  Well, you know, I was doing searches on Arnold.
[02:11:14.458 --> 02:11:19.083]  And, uh, you know, just for the film, and I only put one shot of this in the film, but him at a distance.
[02:11:19.103 --> 02:11:21.025]  I didn't want to actually show a close-up.
[02:11:21.485 --> 02:11:28.853]  And Arnold was visiting in Germany, one of his favorite Austrian artists, and the guy's thing is dead babies with Nazis standing around it.
[02:11:29.354 --> 02:11:34.139]  Uh, these are artists, but it's real dead bodies of children, and very satanic.
[02:11:34.199 --> 02:11:36.341]  I mean, it's palpably evil, Paul.
[02:11:37.811 --> 02:11:38.491]  It always is.
[02:11:39.092 --> 02:11:43.394]  The Channel 4 show where the artists are eating babies and fetuses.
[02:11:44.275 --> 02:11:45.896]  That was certainly very savory.
[02:11:46.576 --> 02:11:47.537]  Yeah, I actually have that.
[02:11:48.277 --> 02:11:53.761]  I didn't put much of it in... I just put a news article about it in Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:11:54.141 --> 02:11:56.062]  I didn't put the actual baby gobbling in there.
[02:11:57.383 --> 02:11:58.824]  Certainly, that was Schwarzenegger.
[02:11:59.864 --> 02:12:04.467]  I've seen pictures of him, which we probably couldn't even put on the website, that graphic.
[02:12:07.606 --> 02:12:10.567]  Yep, Christian conservative, as usual.
[02:12:12.148 --> 02:12:14.329]  Don't talk about Arnold, you're an evil liberal, Paul, okay?
[02:12:15.609 --> 02:12:16.690]  Alright, we'll talk to Cheryl.
[02:12:16.710 --> 02:12:19.891]  We'll take some calls later in about 15-20 minutes.
[02:12:19.911 --> 02:12:20.532]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:12:20.552 --> 02:12:24.433]  Any issue you want to talk about, 800-259-9231.
[02:12:25.954 --> 02:12:30.076]  Paul, we talked about Lord Limbaugh and torture, the latest plumbing of the depths.
[02:12:30.776 --> 02:12:32.597]  You wanted to get into the latest Downing Street stuff.
[02:12:32.637 --> 02:12:33.097]  Go ahead and hit it.
[02:12:34.148 --> 02:12:40.291]  Yeah, Limbaugh has on his website a transcript posted of his comments regarding the Downing Street memo yesterday.
[02:12:41.112 --> 02:12:48.416]  And of course, he refused to even talk about it until these questions about one of the documents being a potential hoax surfaced.
[02:12:49.356 --> 02:12:59.582]  Now, to make it clear, although the headlines are full of words... By the way, we're on record predicting this would happen, because they're ignoring all the other real documents and focusing on Downing Street.
[02:12:59.882 --> 02:13:00.862]  Red flags, baby!
[02:13:01.623 --> 02:13:02.203]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:13:04.677 --> 02:13:10.361]  I had the lightbulb go off in my head when I watched a video about the Diana murder last Thursday.
[02:13:11.021 --> 02:13:23.428]  And they were talking about, as Shayla did yesterday, how the CIA and MI5 produced fake documents and tried to sell them to Mohammed Al-Fayed, saying that the CIA and MI5 were involved in the Diana murder.
[02:13:23.788 --> 02:13:27.650]  Classic strawman bait and switch.
[02:13:28.050 --> 02:13:29.331]  With the Downing Street memo,
[02:13:30.157 --> 02:13:36.221]  The headlines are full of words like, um, possible hoax, forgery, when the details are actually somewhat different.
[02:13:36.822 --> 02:13:48.589]  The British government has already admitted that the memo is real, but the journalist who broke the story photocopied one of the original documents because the original was government property, so he had to hand it back.
[02:13:49.190 --> 02:13:52.212]  So because this is a photocopy... So now a photocopy is fake?
[02:13:53.172 --> 02:13:58.456]  Yeah, and I saw one website that makes the point that the Bible has been hand-copied over and over again.
[02:13:58.496 --> 02:13:59.797]  Does that mean the Bible is a hoax?
[02:14:01.109 --> 02:14:05.632]  But again, it's just some little minor thing to perseverate on and distract people.
[02:14:06.593 --> 02:14:15.678]  Yeah, because the media totally ignored the story, especially the neocon media, until this photocopy issue came out, and then they all ravenously jumped on it.
[02:14:15.718 --> 02:14:17.339]  Have we found who floated it first?
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:21.241]  Yeah, because they knew they could spin it.
[02:14:21.261 --> 02:14:24.843]  No, no, but what publication floated it that it was a photocopy first?
[02:14:25.964 --> 02:14:27.505]  It was a right-wing blog.
[02:14:29.435 --> 02:14:34.118]  Which is actually an ultra-crony capital socialist bootlicker.
[02:14:36.040 --> 02:14:53.231]  So, at that point the media jumped on it, because they knew they could spin it, enough, you know, for the average person out there who never looks beneath the surface to think it was all a hoax, despite the fact that, as you said, it's just one of many different memos that have been... Yeah, Tim Downing Street admits it's real, they all admit these documents are real.
[02:14:53.251 --> 02:14:57.314]  I mean, it's meetings with Condi Rice and others.
[02:14:58.152 --> 02:15:01.275]  Yes, direct communications to Blair as well from his advisors.
[02:15:01.816 --> 02:15:11.987]  So Rush Limbaugh's Truth Detector article says that Rush didn't talk about the Downing Street Memo because, quote, it didn't interest him.
[02:15:12.387 --> 02:15:15.210]  But of course now he's spinning it full throttle.
[02:15:15.828 --> 02:15:29.674]  And he says that the name Michael Smith, who was the British journalist who wrote the original London Times article, brought back some distant, foggy memory of a Michael Smith being involved in the Rathergate CBS fake document story.
[02:15:30.074 --> 02:15:33.435]  Because, of course, Michael Smith is a very unusual name.
[02:15:34.476 --> 02:15:36.236]  And it would stick out like a sore thumb.
[02:15:36.937 --> 02:15:39.858]  And Limbaugh admits he hasn't even looked into it.
[02:15:39.878 --> 02:15:43.339]  He just remembers Michael Smith being linked with the CBS thing.
[02:15:43.379 --> 02:15:44.800]  No, he knows exactly what he's doing.
[02:15:45.794 --> 02:15:57.837]  And he goes on to say, quote, the original memos don't say anything, they don't prove anything, other than the Brits were concerned about the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq themselves, which of course is a total lie.
[02:15:58.297 --> 02:16:02.818]  We've got the memos, they say, there's nothing there, but it'll be illegal if we don't manufacture this.
[02:16:03.298 --> 02:16:11.740]  Yeah, the memos are direct communications to Blair from his advisors, saying the intelligence was being fixed around the case for war, and that they'd already decided on going to war.
[02:16:12.486 --> 02:16:16.830]  And others, like Condoleezza Rice saying the same thing, were released.
[02:16:17.351 --> 02:16:27.981]  So we have this double-think of A, the memos are old news, we knew all along that they wanted to go to war, and B, that the memos aren't news at all and don't mean anything.
[02:16:28.322 --> 02:16:34.388]  Now even at a third level, triple-think, where Limbaugh says it's all a paranoid left-wing conspiracy.
[02:16:35.191 --> 02:16:36.932]  Now, you know, forget the memos.
[02:16:36.952 --> 02:16:50.519]  We've got Bush's own biographer, Nicky Herskowitz, before they replaced him with someone who would willingly portray Bush in this adulatory light, saying Bush wanted to be a war president and invade in 1999.
[02:16:50.659 --> 02:16:58.043]  And the quote is, quote, one of the keys to being seen as a great leader is to be seen as commander-in-chief.
[02:16:58.323 --> 02:17:01.245]  But notice, the media isn't going to ever focus on that.
[02:17:02.139 --> 02:17:07.505]  Exactly, when in this quote Bush says, if I have a chance to invade, if I have that much capital, I'm not going to waste it.
[02:17:23.013 --> 02:17:36.999]  Um, and we've been talking about the PNAC documents for years, and Limbaugh ends by, as I said earlier, equating those blowing the whistle on this memo, uh, to anti-Semites, because of the Ray McGovern quote that Israel was one of the reasons for going to war in Iraq.
[02:17:38.319 --> 02:17:39.860]  But their own documents say that!
[02:17:41.381 --> 02:17:42.661]  Multiple times over, yeah.
[02:17:42.821 --> 02:17:44.242]  Well that's quadruple thanks then!
[02:17:44.882 --> 02:17:45.502]  I'll be right back.
[02:17:48.143 --> 02:17:50.484]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.

[02:18:01.034 --> 02:18:02.715]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:18:02.735 --> 02:18:05.137]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:18:05.157 --> 02:18:06.478]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[02:18:06.498 --> 02:18:07.359]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:18:22.592 --> 02:18:25.614]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:52.912]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:19:53.647 --> 02:20:09.812]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[02:20:10.752 --> 02:20:15.954]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.

[02:21:09.966 --> 02:21:10.427]  I don't know.
[02:21:28.865 --> 02:21:29.765]  We're good to go.
[02:21:57.865 --> 02:21:59.687]  Paul, what's some of the other items you want to cover?
[02:21:59.727 --> 02:22:02.170]  I've got a few here I want to get to.
[02:22:02.490 --> 02:22:04.192]  Um, nothing really in particular.
[02:22:04.212 --> 02:22:06.514]  I did want to mention the Owls Arca, we think.
[02:22:06.534 --> 02:22:08.436]  Richard Cole had mentioned earlier.
[02:22:08.476 --> 02:22:09.557]  Talk a little bit about that.
[02:22:09.838 --> 02:22:12.420]  Yeah, we also have Porter Goss, who we know is in on 9-11.
[02:22:12.540 --> 02:22:15.203]  We cover that in the films on the website.
[02:22:15.283 --> 02:22:17.065]  Now saying he knows where Bin Laden is.
[02:22:17.886 --> 02:22:18.907]  Why don't you comment on that?
[02:22:20.223 --> 02:22:21.343]  Well, yeah.
[02:22:22.024 --> 02:22:28.165]  Every week, basically, we have different officials coming out and saying they either know where he is or that he's dead.
[02:22:28.925 --> 02:22:34.407]  President Musharraf of Pakistan has been saying that he's been dead for about three years.
[02:22:35.147 --> 02:22:37.508]  And then we have... And that's the intel we've got from the White House.
[02:22:37.548 --> 02:22:38.648]  Part of a deal with the family.
[02:22:38.668 --> 02:22:39.448]  They handed him over.
[02:22:39.488 --> 02:22:40.108]  He's on IJE.
[02:22:40.449 --> 02:22:42.509]  In case they ever want to roll him out, he died of kidney failure.
[02:22:43.729 --> 02:22:45.110]  Maybe even before 9-11, but go ahead.
[02:22:46.189 --> 02:22:54.096]  So occasionally, um, the government needs people to reinforce the myth of this shadowy figure that's still waiting out there to get us.
[02:22:54.796 --> 02:23:03.043]  And we've had the articles time and time again where they were this close to getting Bin Laden and time and time again miraculously he escaped.
[02:23:04.207 --> 02:23:13.501]  So it only makes sense that they'd bring the boogeyman back to the public's attention at occasional intervals and with things like these videotapes.
[02:23:13.861 --> 02:23:16.185]  The interesting thing about the videotapes is that
[02:23:16.852 --> 02:23:20.713]  They've probably produced more of them than those that have been shown.
[02:23:21.134 --> 02:23:27.836]  Because Al Jazeera said that they had hours and hours of Bin Laden videotapes which were received.
[02:23:27.956 --> 02:23:32.138]  But also the US government got caught releasing videos that they admitted were old videos.
[02:23:32.318 --> 02:23:35.519]  Others looked at videos the government released that turned out to be a fat guy in the dark.
[02:23:35.639 --> 02:23:36.959]  Voice prints didn't even match.
[02:23:37.359 --> 02:23:38.240]  So we have all of that.
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:44.202]  And then now with Al Juhari, he's been killed four times, captured five times, injured dozens of times.
[02:23:45.243 --> 02:23:47.505]  Now the Egyptians are going uh-uh.
[02:23:47.545 --> 02:23:49.267]  One of their biggest papers is saying uh-uh.
[02:23:49.607 --> 02:23:51.409]  This boy works for the Central Intelligence.
[02:23:52.711 --> 02:23:55.454]  And the big Iranian papers say the same thing.
[02:23:56.261 --> 02:23:59.262]  Very good reasons for doing so.
[02:23:59.682 --> 02:24:03.523]  One explanation is that what his group and the U.S.
[02:24:04.244 --> 02:24:18.988]  government have in common is that they want to prevent an Iraqi Shia base from assuming power, which is why all the prominent Iraqi Shia leaders were assassinated shortly after Bush declared mission accomplished.
[02:24:19.008 --> 02:24:20.429]  And it's always blind on Al-Qaeda?
[02:24:21.441 --> 02:24:27.408]  Yeah, so you've got that, and then you've got the basic explanation that they want to keep the chaos ongoing.
[02:24:27.748 --> 02:24:29.891]  We have Al Qaeda trying to kill Qaddafi for the U.S.
[02:24:29.931 --> 02:24:30.311]  government in 96, 97.
[02:24:31.713 --> 02:24:33.575]  We have them attacking the Serbs two years later.
[02:24:33.595 --> 02:24:36.478]  They're just always doing their job for their bosses.
[02:24:37.170 --> 02:24:38.051]  Yeah, and it gives the U.S.
[02:24:38.991 --> 02:24:40.252]  the reason to stay in there.
[02:24:40.672 --> 02:24:48.836]  Scott Ritzer came out yesterday and said that these same groups linked to al-Zarqa, we were carrying out bombings in Iran to try and destabilize that government so the U.S.
[02:24:48.876 --> 02:24:50.057]  could then go in and invade.
[02:24:50.237 --> 02:24:51.578]  Yeah, that's what the Iranians are saying.
[02:24:51.598 --> 02:24:54.400]  Boy, they just always... I mean, and people don't even look at the motives.
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:55.560]  We have the U.S.
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:25:05.986]  government admitting they kicked Mossadegh out in 1953, a pro-America guy that wore a suit and tie, who had kicked the Russians out, and they went and staged bombings and blamed it on him.
[02:25:06.778 --> 02:25:07.919]  They never stop, Paul!
[02:25:09.461 --> 02:25:16.427]  Well, something they did stop doing is these beheading videos which we've seen very little of in the past few months.
[02:25:16.986 --> 02:25:19.428]  Probably, because they got caught staging half of them.
[02:25:19.848 --> 02:25:32.357]  I mean, you had a guy in San Francisco who created a low-budget beheading video, staged it, sent it out to the media, they picked up on it straight away, reported it as a real story with no investigation.
[02:25:32.617 --> 02:25:33.838]  We have anti-U.S.
[02:25:33.958 --> 02:25:41.544]  aid workers married to Iraqis living there 15 years, it said blonde-haired men came and grabbed her, then they blow her head off and Al-Qaeda did it.
[02:25:42.509 --> 02:25:55.961]  Exactly, and a lot of the people that get kidnapped, as I mentioned last time I was on the show, like those Japanese journalists who were investigating DU, are investigating very sensitive issues in Iraq, like the journalists who keep getting killed.
[02:25:56.502 --> 02:26:06.091]  Mario Dahner, the Palestinian journalist working for Reuters, uncovered, according to his brother, mass graves of US troops.
[02:26:06.651 --> 02:26:12.298]  He was gunned down right outside Abu Ghraib, I believe.
[02:26:13.359 --> 02:26:16.682]  Our government covered up 5,000 dead U.S.
[02:26:16.722 --> 02:26:20.467]  troops from the first four years of the undeclared war in Vietnam.
[02:26:20.727 --> 02:26:21.788]  That's now admitted, folks.
[02:26:21.848 --> 02:26:24.231]  We know they're covering up massive deaths this time, too.
[02:26:25.672 --> 02:26:28.354]  Well, they won't let us see the coffin photographs either.
[02:26:28.774 --> 02:26:38.881]  And then we get whistleblowers coming out and saying that they are taking the bodies to secure military locations in places like Cyprus, away from the public glare.
[02:26:38.981 --> 02:26:43.304]  So, the intention's there, the motive's there, and that's what they're doing.
[02:26:43.324 --> 02:26:49.028]  Tell folks specifically what the Egyptians, who by the way are our allies, are saying right now about Mr. Zawahiri.
[02:26:50.149 --> 02:26:52.590]  They're saying the same thing that the Iranians are saying, that
[02:26:54.204 --> 02:26:54.504]  The U.S.
[02:26:54.564 --> 02:26:59.486]  are aiding him in his bombings and assassinations to prevent a Shia power base.
[02:27:01.687 --> 02:27:03.247]  But that's a motive and evidence.
[02:27:03.287 --> 02:27:04.327]  We shouldn't follow that.
[02:27:04.407 --> 02:27:09.109]  We should just emotionally talk about Iraq like we're experts and we can't even find it on a map, Paul.
[02:27:10.489 --> 02:27:10.930]  Exactly.
[02:27:10.950 --> 02:27:12.770]  There's an Al-Zawki archive.
[02:27:12.830 --> 02:27:17.832]  If you get a look on data pages down the left-hand side of PrisonPlanet.com where all this evidence is.
[02:27:19.045 --> 02:27:19.785]  It's ridiculous.
[02:27:19.805 --> 02:27:21.086]  I mean, how dumb do they think we are?
[02:27:21.526 --> 02:27:22.866]  I want to get into the thumb scanners.
[02:27:22.886 --> 02:27:24.666]  They're going into buy and sell now everywhere.
[02:27:25.687 --> 02:27:29.868]  And we also have some other little articles here about the Mexican drug commandos who work for the U.S.
[02:27:29.888 --> 02:27:32.608]  government out killing innocent feds and others.
[02:27:32.628 --> 02:27:34.049]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:34.069 --> 02:27:34.489]  Stay with us.
[02:27:37.049 --> 02:27:37.970]  We're on the march.
[02:27:38.430 --> 02:27:40.090]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.110 --> 02:27:43.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.602 --> 02:27:48.303]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be in force.
[02:27:48.483 --> 02:27:50.505]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.

[02:31:21.006 --> 02:31:26.829]  All this criminal government is doing, and it has nothing to do with George Bush, he's a puppet, is dismantling this nation.
[02:31:27.129 --> 02:31:34.053]  Meanwhile, you're arguing about the evil liberals versus the wonderful Republicans, or the evil Republicans versus the wonderful liberals.
[02:31:35.313 --> 02:31:38.895]  Meanwhile, Bill Clinton's a surrogate member of the family and Barbara's son.
[02:31:40.359 --> 02:31:41.700]  And the policies are identical.

[02:32:18.343 --> 02:32:20.505]  And Debbie, it's good to have you on with us.
[02:32:21.045 --> 02:32:21.965]  Hi there, Alex.
[02:32:22.065 --> 02:32:23.166]  I'm glad to be on.
[02:32:23.226 --> 02:32:24.127]  How are you today?
[02:32:24.687 --> 02:32:25.087]  I'm good.
[02:32:25.107 --> 02:32:31.771]  You know, I was on Rents.com this morning, getting ready for my show, and I saw a direct link to the FDA's own website on water.
[02:32:32.566 --> 02:32:32.966]  Uh-huh.
[02:32:33.166 --> 02:32:41.990]  And I meant to tell my webmaster to link to it and put a link over to BigMurky.com because it's just amazing.
[02:32:42.491 --> 02:32:47.553]  I spent like 20 minutes and actually got behind this morning looking at what they allow in the water.
[02:32:48.053 --> 02:32:51.555]  The level of pesticides, the level of herbicides, the level of bacteria.
[02:32:52.175 --> 02:32:53.156]  I want to scare people.
[02:32:53.236 --> 02:32:53.596]  It's true.
[02:32:53.656 --> 02:32:55.837]  I want people to buy these high-quality filters.
[02:32:56.417 --> 02:32:58.218]  I want people to stop drinking this poison.
[02:32:58.318 --> 02:32:59.959]  I know I wouldn't drink it or give it to my family.
[02:33:00.746 --> 02:33:17.335]  Oh, I know, and Berkey Water is about the best water you can really get, and it's very, very affordable, Alex, and that's one reason that I like working for the company is because I really feel like we're providing a product that people can afford and that they can rely on and trust in, you know?
[02:33:22.316 --> 02:33:22.856]  Absolutely.
[02:33:22.896 --> 02:33:25.378]  Give folks the website where they can go and check out the filters.
[02:33:25.838 --> 02:33:26.238]  Okay.
[02:33:26.659 --> 02:33:35.644]  It's www.berkeywater.com and it's spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R dot com.
[02:33:35.724 --> 02:33:39.746]  Or they can link through oninfowars.com or get it right off our shopping cart.
[02:33:40.346 --> 02:33:43.508]  You've got little water bottles that just make the water safe.
[02:33:43.548 --> 02:33:47.089]  You've got big filters that cut everything out, even the fluoride.
[02:33:47.629 --> 02:33:51.631]  You've got preparedness videos, preparedness CDs.
[02:33:52.411 --> 02:33:55.453]  You've got potassium iodide in case there's a radiological event.
[02:33:55.733 --> 02:33:57.293]  It's just an insurance policy.
[02:33:57.614 --> 02:34:00.935]  The stuff they're giving to the firemen and military and police that they don't give you.
[02:34:01.335 --> 02:34:07.678]  You've got so much really neat stuff made right here in America on your website and if folks call you.
[02:34:08.268 --> 02:34:14.111]  That's right and we also have the new products available now that we are just starting to introduce to the public.
[02:34:14.451 --> 02:34:21.714]  We have the new stainless steel units in several different sizes and they do come with the Black Berkey purification elements now.
[02:34:22.095 --> 02:34:27.957]  So be sure to click on to the new product and they can call in to me at toll free 1-888-803-4438.
[02:34:32.094 --> 02:34:41.197]  And if I'm not there, especially in the next few days, just leave a message and leave your number two times so I can be sure to call you back.
[02:34:41.637 --> 02:34:45.799]  And if you want to let me know how late it's okay to call, then I'll call in the evening.
[02:34:45.919 --> 02:34:49.000]  Also, we've been getting lots of response to our new product.
[02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.281]  Are you going to be out of town?
[02:34:52.272 --> 02:34:55.396]  Actually, I'm going to be in and out for the next two days.
[02:34:55.496 --> 02:35:07.809]  My ex-mother-in-law and ex-sister-in-law are visiting me, and I'm going to take them to Oklahoma to visit, but I'm only going to be gone like a few hours here and there, so Judy will be there also taking messages.
[02:35:07.889 --> 02:35:09.551]  So you've got folks there at the office?
[02:35:09.731 --> 02:35:10.532]  Absolutely.
[02:35:10.812 --> 02:35:11.272]  Absolutely.
[02:35:11.292 --> 02:35:14.316]  We have people there to take their calls, and of course,
[02:35:14.876 --> 02:35:22.122]  We just love to be able to talk with everyone and hear and make sure that their water needs are taken care of, you know, to the best.
[02:35:22.622 --> 02:35:28.086]  So, basically, you've got these beautiful stainless steel bodies with the improved black Berkey elements.
[02:35:28.406 --> 02:35:30.928]  We do, and they come in several different sizes now.
[02:35:31.148 --> 02:35:36.873]  Are you still offering that crazy deal where you have the 3-gallon stainless steel with the white elements?
[02:35:37.473 --> 02:35:38.774]  Yes, we are, and it's $225.
[02:35:39.155 --> 02:35:48.142]  Folks, for those that don't know, a 2 gallon unit at the camping supply store of a knockoff Indian brand that's a piece of junk is $300.
[02:35:49.944 --> 02:35:51.585]  Okay, 220 what?
[02:35:53.067 --> 02:35:57.551]  $225 for the 3 gallon, 2 imperial filter system.
[02:35:57.611 --> 02:35:59.012]  It's a really great deal.
[02:35:59.252 --> 02:36:01.674]  Yeah, I bought an imperial 5 years ago.
[02:36:01.714 --> 02:36:02.615]  I've got 2 other units.
[02:36:02.995 --> 02:36:04.897]  I've bought now, what, 6 or 7 different units?
[02:36:05.908 --> 02:36:10.609]  And so, you guys just do a great job and it's a gift I like to give to friends and family.
[02:36:10.969 --> 02:36:13.450]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[02:36:13.470 --> 02:36:15.431]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:36:15.451 --> 02:36:19.512]  888-803-4438.
[02:36:21.092 --> 02:36:23.273]  And you also make our shortwave outreach possible.
[02:36:23.293 --> 02:36:25.334]  They're our one big sponsor for that.
[02:36:25.354 --> 02:36:26.274]  888-803-4438.
[02:36:26.434 --> 02:36:30.555]  Debbie, Godspeed and drive safe when you're going to Oklahoma.
[02:36:30.915 --> 02:36:32.376]  Thank you very much.
[02:36:32.676 --> 02:36:33.376]  Take care.
[02:36:33.396 --> 02:36:33.736]  Bye, Debbie.
[02:36:34.790 --> 02:36:40.731]  Okay, Berkeywater.com or Infowars.com or simply call toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:36:41.632 --> 02:36:43.772]  Paul, I meant to call you this morning.
[02:36:43.792 --> 02:36:46.833]  I need to call my Infowars webmaster, Ryan Slickhizen, too.
[02:36:48.033 --> 02:36:52.434]  On rents, about five big blocks down, he's got just a blink to the FDA.
[02:36:53.535 --> 02:36:54.595]  Food and Drug Administration.
[02:36:54.675 --> 02:36:56.555]  I spent like 20 minutes on that this morning.
[02:36:56.595 --> 02:36:57.736]  I did get behind because of it.
[02:36:58.296 --> 02:37:02.497]  I mean, I knew there was bad stuff in the water, but this is what they admit is quote, acceptable.
[02:37:02.517 --> 02:37:03.477]  They don't call it safe.
[02:37:04.901 --> 02:37:05.982]  But acceptable levels.
[02:37:06.523 --> 02:37:08.686]  Hundreds of things in the water supply.
[02:37:08.926 --> 02:37:11.169]  So Paul, do me a favor and link to that too.
[02:37:11.589 --> 02:37:13.952]  And put a little banner or link up to the Berkeys for me.
[02:37:14.833 --> 02:37:15.434]  Okay, will do.
[02:37:16.253 --> 02:37:17.574]  How's your water over in England?
[02:37:17.594 --> 02:37:18.995]  Is it as luscious as ours?
[02:37:19.875 --> 02:37:27.280]  Well you remember the story about there was a brand of bottled water which was owned by the Coca-Cola company.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:31.182]  Turned out it was jam-packed with cancerous carcinogens.
[02:37:31.703 --> 02:37:37.566]  The point is they were getting that water from local estuaries and not even treating it at all.
[02:37:37.666 --> 02:37:39.988]  So that was going into the tap water as well.
[02:37:40.008 --> 02:37:42.329]  So it gives you an example of
[02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:44.151]  I mean, I've fell down on that.
[02:37:44.231 --> 02:37:48.615]  I need to know if they're shipped to the UK, because I haven't... I used to have a small water filter.
[02:37:48.655 --> 02:37:49.395]  I haven't got any now.
[02:37:50.276 --> 02:37:52.818]  So it's something I need to... Well, they also carry the British Berkey.
[02:37:53.679 --> 02:37:55.180]  You can buy it right there from the source.
[02:37:56.481 --> 02:37:57.362]  And again, to be clear...
[02:37:59.398 --> 02:38:03.120]  New Millennium Concepts and the American Berkey, they started out over a decade ago.
[02:38:03.160 --> 02:38:06.321]  They're the big national de-distributor for British Barkfeld.
[02:38:06.341 --> 02:38:07.942]  They still carry those with the white elements.
[02:38:08.302 --> 02:38:12.124]  The Queen commissioned it a hundred and something years ago and it's just been upgraded over and over again.
[02:38:12.464 --> 02:38:16.926]  It's what all the, you know, the Red Cross and others use when they're in Africa.
[02:38:17.246 --> 02:38:18.246]  That's a great system.
[02:38:18.286 --> 02:38:19.647]  You know, it really cuts it out.
[02:38:20.565 --> 02:38:22.666]  It's a lot better than the Indian or Chinese knock-offs.
[02:38:22.686 --> 02:38:24.906]  You can still buy those from New Millennium.
[02:38:25.166 --> 02:38:30.667]  But then they, after like five years of research, they have university studies they'll send you, made a black Berkey.
[02:38:31.487 --> 02:38:33.208]  And that's a big, fat black element.
[02:38:33.228 --> 02:38:35.348]  It weighs like twice as much more than the white elements.
[02:38:36.088 --> 02:38:38.549]  And it's just amazing, Paul, and yeah.
[02:38:39.969 --> 02:38:48.091]  Well, again, every week I see articles about how they're trying to introduce thorium fluoride into the water in areas of England as well.
[02:38:49.028 --> 02:38:51.349]  Which is, I mean, you can't get away from it.
[02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:56.472]  The fluoride-free toothpaste has to be specially imported.
[02:38:56.512 --> 02:38:58.033]  They don't even sell it in England.
[02:38:58.073 --> 02:39:03.296]  You have to pay about four times the amount for it, which shows you how much they're trying to force this on us.
[02:39:03.676 --> 02:39:04.757]  Hey, that's an idea, Paul.
[02:39:04.777 --> 02:39:09.319]  You want to get with some investors and come out with a British-made toothpaste.
[02:39:11.818 --> 02:39:13.499]  I've got quite a lot of other things to do.
[02:39:13.539 --> 02:39:15.239]  No, I know, but I mean, these are ideas.
[02:39:15.859 --> 02:39:17.640]  Well, no, that's a good thing to give people that.
[02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:19.801]  I buy that Tom's of Maine, non-fluoride.
[02:39:19.981 --> 02:39:25.223]  Yeah, I mean, that's what I get, but it costs me about, you know, the equivalent of $10 for a liter.
[02:39:25.263 --> 02:39:26.023]  But here's the deal.
[02:39:26.543 --> 02:39:38.167]  With 70-plus percent of America's trying to buy organic now, suddenly all over even the mainstream grocery stores, organic, organic, organic, just by demanding it, we're taking things back.
[02:39:39.022 --> 02:39:41.064]  Well, I mean, that is one good thing about England.
[02:39:41.084 --> 02:39:46.790]  You can get organic food everywhere and you can get a lot of grass-fed meat, cattle.
[02:39:47.171 --> 02:39:49.213]  So, in that sense, it's fair.
[02:39:49.233 --> 02:39:49.693]  Think of that!
[02:39:49.733 --> 02:39:51.395]  That kind of sounds al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:39:51.856 --> 02:39:53.317]  Grass-fed cows!
[02:39:54.539 --> 02:39:55.399]  Who would have ever thought?
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:39:59.424]  I mean, you've got a special get-that, you know, instead of rotten meat-fed cows.
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:00.740]  Exactly.
[02:40:00.761 --> 02:40:02.081]  They have to put it on the label.
[02:40:02.442 --> 02:40:05.503]  Well, it's a good selling point now because so many people want it.
[02:40:05.644 --> 02:40:07.405]  But is it connected to Al-Qaeda?
[02:40:07.445 --> 02:40:09.726]  These rumours about not feeding cows rotten meat?
[02:40:10.627 --> 02:40:11.207]  It could be.
[02:40:11.267 --> 02:40:16.250]  I mean, was the mad cow outbreak in 2001 just a big conspiracy theory?
[02:40:16.270 --> 02:40:18.051]  And was Al-Qaeda behind it?
[02:40:18.852 --> 02:40:19.192]  Well, no.
[02:40:19.252 --> 02:40:20.713]  The British government was behind it.
[02:40:21.193 --> 02:40:22.894]  Well, they wouldn't lie to us, Paul!
[02:40:23.695 --> 02:40:24.775]  Government lie?
[02:40:24.795 --> 02:40:25.376]  Man, you're...
[02:40:26.801 --> 02:40:28.142]  Are you Bin Laden?
[02:40:28.262 --> 02:40:29.202]  Maybe you're Bin Laden.
[02:40:30.944 --> 02:40:32.044]  Alright, I'll quit being stupid.
[02:40:33.745 --> 02:40:38.088]  KSDKTV News Channel out of Arnold, Missouri.
[02:40:39.288 --> 02:40:40.809]  Forget credit cards or checks.
[02:40:40.869 --> 02:40:42.010]  Pay with your fingerprint.
[02:40:42.030 --> 02:40:43.771]  They're the first in Missouri to have it.
[02:40:43.791 --> 02:40:44.411]  That's not true.
[02:40:44.872 --> 02:40:48.594]  A convenience store in Arnold has a new way for customers to pay by scanning their fingerprints.
[02:40:48.934 --> 02:40:52.536]  With this new system, customers won't need to carry a check, debit card, or even cash.
[02:40:53.837 --> 02:40:55.418]  All they need is their finger and a code.
[02:40:56.851 --> 02:41:11.401]  Philip 66 Express Mart of Richardson in Arnold chose Biopay to get their consumers and customers in and out of the door fast to enroll customers need a driver's license, a blank check, and a 10 digit code.
[02:41:11.962 --> 02:41:16.965]  Again, they'll also then enroll what you're buying in a database, which could be your phone number.
[02:41:17.634 --> 02:41:20.936]  Customer, uh, Mary Hemings said, I think it's a great idea!
[02:41:20.956 --> 02:41:30.260]  I... It's simple, easy, you just walk in, don't need to mess with your checkbooks, just put your finger on this, make your purchase, and it comes out of my checkbook!
[02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:34.342]  Retailers also like it because they have to pay a lot less for transaction fees.
[02:41:34.822 --> 02:41:35.562]  See how they're doing that?
[02:41:35.943 --> 02:41:38.824]  Express Smart Assistant Manager Kevin Warnick.
[02:41:39.044 --> 02:41:43.826]  See, they're going to jack, because of identity fraud, which they caused, the companies, by selling data packages.
[02:41:43.846 --> 02:41:46.227]  That's where most of this happens, is them selling your data.
[02:41:46.827 --> 02:41:55.611]  Now, you might pay 5-6% if you don't thumb scan, but if you do thumb scan, it may be free ball incentives!
[02:41:56.191 --> 02:41:57.292]  It's so convenient.
[02:41:58.932 --> 02:41:59.953]  The problem with it is,
[02:42:00.737 --> 02:42:08.943]  The system is going to eventually ape the trusted traveler CAPT2 security grading for flying on airlines.
[02:42:08.963 --> 02:42:09.703]  Well, they've said that.
[02:42:10.164 --> 02:42:10.724]  They've said that.
[02:42:11.084 --> 02:42:18.589]  Yeah, whereby you're graded at a certain color level according to your threat, which of course means you're an obedient citizen.
[02:42:18.629 --> 02:42:22.152]  By the way, I saw a 45-year-old man yesterday be ID'd for a lighter.
[02:42:23.261 --> 02:42:25.222]  He wasn't even buying cigarettes at Tiger Mark.
[02:42:25.542 --> 02:42:26.502]  He was buying a lighter.
[02:42:26.522 --> 02:42:28.282]  And the lady said, uh, ID please.
[02:42:28.302 --> 02:42:28.923]  He said, excuse me?
[02:42:28.983 --> 02:42:30.843]  She goes, oh, we ask for that now for all matches.
[02:42:31.523 --> 02:42:34.024]  See, and I've talked to employees at Diamond Shamrock.
[02:42:34.284 --> 02:42:37.205]  They say they've been told soon everything will be carded.
[02:42:37.805 --> 02:42:38.425]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:39.806 --> 02:42:49.488]  Um, and then, you know, MasterCard get caught, what was it, 40 million people's data hacked and we're supposed to trust these companies.
[02:42:50.549 --> 02:42:52.149]  And I mean, the problem with it is that
[02:42:52.896 --> 02:42:57.997]  Not only will you be, um, ordered, not if, it's not if, but when.
[02:42:58.397 --> 02:43:00.778]  Sorry, not when, but if you're allowed to buy.
[02:43:00.838 --> 02:43:06.879]  If you've got a security grading which is red, the government, um, doesn't approve of... Paul, I've seen their plans.
[02:43:06.939 --> 02:43:16.581]  How many years ago did I describe the Christian family goes in to buy food, and the, and the, you know, the clerk's behind armored glass and he hits a button because the face scan shows they're a security threat.
[02:43:17.725 --> 02:43:23.834]  Exactly, and it also... Look folks, they're going to have a terrorist group that blows stuff up who's against microchipping.
[02:43:24.175 --> 02:43:29.222]  You watch, I guarantee within 10 to 15 years this will be happening and we don't stop them.
[02:43:30.764 --> 02:43:31.265]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:32.029 --> 02:43:39.796]  And with the databases that they will expand on this, it will lead to more invasive advertising, that kind of stuff.
[02:43:39.836 --> 02:43:42.939]  Now they've got it down to the level of neuro-advertising.
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:49.565]  Well, it's like when they swipe the guy's card to get the lighter, you know, the middle-aged man.
[02:43:50.046 --> 02:43:54.650]  They swiped his card to do it, and see, they just got his data without paying for it.
[02:43:57.586 --> 02:44:01.969]  I mean, almost every store I go to, phone number, zip code please, I go, I'm buying a pair of goggles for swimming.
[02:44:02.509 --> 02:44:03.770]  They're $6.95 here.
[02:44:04.270 --> 02:44:05.331]  Well, sir, we need that.
[02:44:05.731 --> 02:44:06.311]  No, you don't.
[02:44:06.331 --> 02:44:07.672]  You've got to pay me for that data.
[02:44:07.812 --> 02:44:08.372]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:44:09.473 --> 02:44:12.695]  Well, it came in on the back of this chip and pin thing.
[02:44:12.715 --> 02:44:22.641]  It's all directed around self-service, where you put your pin code into the machine while you're buying something, so it eliminates the need for them to have checkout employees.
[02:44:23.268 --> 02:44:32.119]  So it came on the back of that and it's only expanding and eventually, as you said, it will be the implantable microchip where all this data is centrally housed.
[02:44:36.167 --> 02:44:50.574]  Well, Paul, the good news is, you know, I've been boycotting HEB for years, but their foods are so much better and their prices are so much better than the Kroger's subsidiary, Randall's, where they interrogate you trying to tell you to take their spy card.
[02:44:50.594 --> 02:44:57.457]  So I said, OK, I'll just go to Slave B. Because Slave B is closer and, you know, Slave B's got better stuff.
[02:44:58.166 --> 02:45:07.587]  And so I'm in Slave Bean, and I'm in there like 1 o'clock, not 1 o'clock, about midnight buying food for a Father's Day brunch with my parents and others, my wife's parents coming over, Sunday.
[02:45:09.053 --> 02:45:11.015]  And literally, everybody must have done the same thing.
[02:45:11.075 --> 02:45:12.976]  The place is crawling at midnight.
[02:45:13.116 --> 02:45:14.877]  Just totally jam-packed.
[02:45:15.417 --> 02:45:17.979]  And I'm going up to the counter with my eggs and stuff like that.
[02:45:19.059 --> 02:45:22.521]  And literally, it's just giant lines with two checkout lanes going.
[02:45:22.942 --> 02:45:24.863]  And they're trying to tell people, use the self-checkout.
[02:45:24.963 --> 02:45:25.243]  No!
[02:45:25.443 --> 02:45:25.703]  No!
[02:45:26.043 --> 02:45:27.344]  And I'm like, man, I need a camera.
[02:45:27.504 --> 02:45:29.325]  There was a revolt going on right there!
[02:45:29.846 --> 02:45:30.106]  No!
[02:45:30.226 --> 02:45:30.466]  No!
[02:45:30.586 --> 02:45:30.866]  No!
[02:45:31.487 --> 02:45:33.828]  And we want to deal with a human in exchange.
[02:45:33.868 --> 02:45:35.469]  And we know those machines are horrible.
[02:45:37.213 --> 02:45:41.334]  Yeah, same kind of sentiment in Britain, I've heard from many people.
[02:45:42.835 --> 02:45:48.716]  The technology is at an earlier stage in this country, but people are opposed to it across the board.
[02:45:49.256 --> 02:45:56.258]  And then places like Tesco bring out RFID scanners that know when you pick the product up off the shelf.
[02:45:56.378 --> 02:45:59.779]  But Andy Rooney says we all need a chip so we know who's safe.
[02:45:59.859 --> 02:46:04.400]  I mean, are all these people I saw at HEB refusing to use a self-checkout?
[02:46:04.841 --> 02:46:06.281]  They're going to let Al-Qaeda get us!
[02:46:07.319 --> 02:46:08.321]  It's their fault, Paul!
[02:46:25.600 --> 02:46:31.722]  Wal-Mart insisted on having the RFID in and obviously these aren't subsidiary supermarkets.
[02:46:31.882 --> 02:46:33.323]  I will not go to Wal-Mart.
[02:46:33.343 --> 02:46:35.663]  I go in there about twice a year and always get confronted.
[02:46:36.104 --> 02:46:38.925]  It's like I'm a Baptist caught buying a liter of whiskey.
[02:46:39.645 --> 02:46:41.365]  And I come walking, and, what are you doing here?
[02:46:41.425 --> 02:46:42.366]  You say you don't come here.
[02:46:42.386 --> 02:46:45.647]  And I'm like, well, it's, you know, one in the morning and I forgot to buy videotapes.
[02:46:45.687 --> 02:46:48.928]  I'm going on a, you know, shooting mission tomorrow, shoot some video.
[02:46:49.508 --> 02:46:51.029]  But I will not go in there.
[02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:52.469]  I just will not do it.
[02:46:53.149 --> 02:46:54.670]  And everybody else needs to stop it.
[02:46:57.242 --> 02:46:58.144]  I'm serious, Paul.
[02:46:59.006 --> 02:46:59.948]  Let's take a call here.
[02:47:00.670 --> 02:47:01.532]  Uh, who's up next here?
[02:47:02.737 --> 02:47:03.337]  Kim in Texas.
[02:47:03.377 --> 02:47:03.958]  Go ahead, Kim.
[02:47:04.698 --> 02:47:05.218]  Hey, you guys.
[02:47:05.278 --> 02:47:06.599]  I just wanted y'all to let me know.
[02:47:06.619 --> 02:47:13.862]  You just made me realize I must be with Al-Qaeda since I just bought that side of grass-fed beef about two weeks ago.
[02:47:14.923 --> 02:47:15.383]  Oh, no.
[02:47:15.563 --> 02:47:16.724]  Oh, no.
[02:47:16.864 --> 02:47:18.085]  Cows don't eat grass.
[02:47:18.125 --> 02:47:19.245]  The media said so.
[02:47:20.146 --> 02:47:21.906]  You are with Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:21.946 --> 02:47:22.667]  You're mentally ill.
[02:47:22.687 --> 02:47:23.967]  You need a new freedom checkup.
[02:47:24.288 --> 02:47:25.228]  I better watch out.
[02:47:25.248 --> 02:47:26.969]  Think of how extreme we've gotten.
[02:47:27.009 --> 02:47:28.149]  We're for cows eating grass.
[02:47:28.230 --> 02:47:29.270]  We're on the edge now.
[02:47:31.511 --> 02:47:41.093]  But actually, what I was calling was, Alex, I just wanted to tell you how glad I am, actually, that you expose all this ugly and evil stuff on a daily basis.
[02:47:41.273 --> 02:47:48.315]  Because, you know, I'd much rather know what I'm fighting against than to get, you know, hit in the back of the head by something I don't see coming.
[02:47:48.995 --> 02:47:56.337]  So, you know, all those, you know, I don't know how any parent out there can fear for anything but the future of their children.
[02:47:56.557 --> 02:47:57.797]  And that's just what it's all about.
[02:47:58.542 --> 02:48:00.403]  Well, I think you shouldn't believe me, Kim.
[02:48:00.483 --> 02:48:05.987]  I think you should... I think beef-fed, rotten beef-fed cows are good, and just feed your children that.
[02:48:06.007 --> 02:48:08.589]  I mean, look, don't be an extremist like we are.
[02:48:08.629 --> 02:48:09.329]  Be trusting.
[02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:11.130]  Yeah, I know.
[02:48:11.170 --> 02:48:15.453]  My mom's actually called me a hippie lately, and if you knew me, you would know how funny that was.
[02:48:16.054 --> 02:48:16.434]  Oh, no.
[02:48:16.654 --> 02:48:16.914]  See?
[02:48:17.374 --> 02:48:19.196]  And a hippie's a step away from Al-Qaeda.
[02:48:19.636 --> 02:48:20.436]  I'm telling ya.
[02:48:20.537 --> 02:48:21.937]  Well, look, I mean, Mercury's good.
[02:48:21.977 --> 02:48:24.019]  I mean, I'm sure your mother's heard the newscast.
[02:48:24.039 --> 02:48:25.800]  Does she think Mercury's nutritious and the vaccines?
[02:48:26.440 --> 02:48:27.241]  She probably does.
[02:48:27.970 --> 02:48:28.591]  Anything else, Carol?
[02:48:28.611 --> 02:48:29.212]  I wouldn't doubt it.
[02:48:29.532 --> 02:48:34.519]  Now, I just want everybody to keep planting those seeds, because the tighter they squeeze, the more people will listen to you.
[02:48:34.559 --> 02:48:35.179]  That's right.
[02:48:35.500 --> 02:48:37.022]  Are folks listening to you now?
[02:48:37.362 --> 02:48:41.708]  They're listening to me now, except for the guy with the love ya W sign in his front yard.
[02:48:41.768 --> 02:48:42.529]  He won't listen to me.
[02:48:42.549 --> 02:48:43.430]  I want to hear about him.
[02:48:43.450 --> 02:48:43.810]  Stay there.
[02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:44.271]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.798 --> 02:48:48.299]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:48.499 --> 02:48:51.581]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.721 --> 02:48:55.624]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.664 --> 02:48:59.887]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:49:00.247 --> 02:49:04.030]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:04.170 --> 02:49:05.971]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:06.571 --> 02:49:09.452]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:09.672 --> 02:49:14.214]  Medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:14.374 --> 02:49:17.415]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:17.595 --> 02:49:20.436]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.936 --> 02:49:27.058]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:27.598 --> 02:49:31.380]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:52:00.438 --> 02:52:03.479]  Mexican drug commandos expand ops in six U.S.
[02:52:03.499 --> 02:52:03.860]  states.
[02:52:04.380 --> 02:52:07.941]  Feds say violent elite paramilitary units establish narcotics routes north of the border.
[02:52:08.322 --> 02:52:09.322]  Yeah, they were trained by the U.S.
[02:52:09.342 --> 02:52:09.602]  government.
[02:52:09.622 --> 02:52:10.462]  They're still being trained.
[02:52:10.843 --> 02:52:25.529]  The ultra-violent U.S.-trained elite Mexican paramilitary commandos, known as Zetas, responsible for hundreds of murders along the border, this year have expanded their enforcement efforts on behalf of drug cartels, U.S.-controlled, by setting up trafficking routes in six U.S.
[02:52:25.549 --> 02:52:25.869]  states.
[02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:27.571]  And our government controls it.
[02:52:27.591 --> 02:52:28.692]  We have all the evidence.
[02:52:29.452 --> 02:52:30.654]  But people just can't get it.
[02:52:31.114 --> 02:52:38.341]  Hey, Kim, when you're talking to your dumbed-down neighbor, was Bush conservative for open borders, gun control, abortion funding, signing on to UNESCO?
[02:52:38.641 --> 02:52:40.123]  That's how you deprogram him.
[02:52:40.163 --> 02:52:44.087]  He thinks he's real trendy and rebellious because he's going with Bush.
[02:52:44.547 --> 02:52:46.029]  He thinks the choice is the Democrats.
[02:52:46.049 --> 02:52:47.030]  Have you explained that to him?
[02:52:48.298 --> 02:52:49.519]  I can't get that far with him.
[02:52:49.539 --> 02:52:50.960]  I mean, but I could keep trying.
[02:52:51.020 --> 02:52:57.805]  Well, he's got the sign in his yard, and it's L-U-V-Y-A.
[02:52:58.145 --> 02:53:00.226]  Love ya, and then D-U-B-Y-A.
[02:53:00.246 --> 02:53:02.488]  Well, I bet Bush might like him, too.
[02:53:02.528 --> 02:53:03.909]  Better watch it, Bush and Gannon.
[02:53:06.454 --> 02:53:08.175]  The guy may not know how much Bush loves him.
[02:53:08.195 --> 02:53:10.797]  Yeah, I mean, he won't even wave at me anymore.
[02:53:10.817 --> 02:53:14.299]  He doesn't like me anymore, so... Well, I mean, Al-Qaeda!
[02:53:14.919 --> 02:53:15.259]  I know!
[02:53:15.299 --> 02:53:17.360]  I got that grass-fed beef, I'm telling ya!
[02:53:17.380 --> 02:53:19.281]  Imagine feeding grass to cows.
[02:53:19.321 --> 02:53:19.942]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:19.962 --> 02:53:21.363]  These people are radical folks.
[02:53:21.443 --> 02:53:22.083]  Really dangerous.
[02:53:22.743 --> 02:53:24.244]  Feeding grass to cows.
[02:53:24.304 --> 02:53:25.485]  Paul, that's pretty radical, isn't it?
[02:53:26.545 --> 02:53:27.706]  That's pretty Al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:53:28.407 --> 02:53:29.067]  Al-Qaeda-ish.
[02:53:29.687 --> 02:53:31.648]  Let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Michigan.
[02:53:31.668 --> 02:53:32.329]  Go ahead, Scott.
[02:53:32.689 --> 02:53:33.529]  Alright, thank you, Alex.
[02:53:33.569 --> 02:53:36.091]  And I just want to thank you very much for letting a player under me.
[02:53:36.750 --> 02:53:40.133]  Is it okay if I do this right now and promote a website?

[02:53:43.436 --> 02:53:43.636]  Why?
[02:53:43.656 --> 02:53:44.437]  Okay.

[02:54:02.073 --> 02:54:03.074]  What else is on your mind?
[02:54:03.686 --> 02:54:07.167]  Well, I'm just, you know, that's basically my website, you know.
[02:54:07.287 --> 02:54:10.549]  It's basically aimed for teens, you know.
[02:54:10.569 --> 02:54:10.969]  I do know.
[02:54:11.049 --> 02:54:12.389]  Hey, listen, thank you for the call.
[02:54:12.429 --> 02:54:13.230]  I appreciate that.
[02:54:13.310 --> 02:54:15.811]  Nathan, Nathaniel in Texas, last caller.
[02:54:15.851 --> 02:54:16.291]  Go ahead.
[02:54:17.311 --> 02:54:18.231]  Can you hear me, Mr. Jones?
[02:54:18.372 --> 02:54:19.052]  Yes, I can.
[02:54:19.312 --> 02:54:22.833]  Hey, I'm the guy that volunteered my services and I'm recovering from surgery.
[02:54:23.013 --> 02:54:24.554]  Maybe you remember me from the draft house.
[02:54:24.934 --> 02:54:26.535]  Oh, you showed up at the movie theater, yeah.
[02:54:26.595 --> 02:54:27.135]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:27.195 --> 02:54:29.036]  I stood up to applaud you.
[02:54:29.116 --> 02:54:29.936]  It was fantastic.
[02:54:30.669 --> 02:54:31.872]  Well, we're going to have the final showing.
[02:54:42.965 --> 02:54:52.528]  I made a bet with him that I'd shut up for two and a half hours if he'd watch the video, and I nearly broke my hand on a coffee table to convince him, but he watched it.
[02:54:52.648 --> 02:54:54.289]  What did your dad think after he saw it?
[02:54:54.429 --> 02:54:57.230]  Well, some people have skulls made out of adamantium.
[02:54:57.270 --> 02:55:00.011]  That's what Wolverine's claws are made out of from the X-Guy.
[02:55:01.912 --> 02:55:02.953]  So he wouldn't wake up?
[02:55:02.973 --> 02:55:05.194]  Well, let's get a comment from Paul.
[02:55:20.916 --> 02:55:23.457]  Well, I mean, the dumbbells don't worry me so much.
[02:55:23.517 --> 02:55:27.058]  It's the more enlightened people who try to rationalize it that worry me.
[02:55:27.078 --> 02:55:40.121]  I mean, I had a conversation with somebody about, you know, the drug trade in Colombia, and his rationalization was that, yeah, that's going on, but if the government wasn't involved in the drug trade, the economy would collapse.
[02:55:40.721 --> 02:55:42.861]  But we've still got to put people's kids in prison!
[02:55:43.481 --> 02:55:47.282]  Yeah, which is like saying a drug addict who got off heroin would feel ill for a while.
[02:55:47.302 --> 02:55:49.783]  I mean, we've got to go cold turkey on it.
[02:55:51.079 --> 02:55:54.442]  Thanks Nathaniel, thank you so much for coming on.
[02:55:54.462 --> 02:55:55.764]  We're out of time Paul, great show.
[02:55:56.024 --> 02:56:00.088]  People should go to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, all the videos, all the materials.
[02:56:00.589 --> 02:56:05.574]  And I'll be last showing a martial law next Monday at the Draft House, 8 o'clock, South Lamar.
[02:56:05.915 --> 02:56:07.076]  Paul, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:56:07.436 --> 02:56:07.897]  Thanks Alex.
[02:56:08.496 --> 02:56:11.557]  Hey, tickets are going fast for that final showing next Monday.
[02:56:11.917 --> 02:56:13.417]  Final showing next Monday.
[02:56:13.777 --> 02:56:14.298]  Say it again.
[02:56:14.578 --> 02:56:16.038]  Final showing next Monday.
[02:56:16.578 --> 02:56:18.058]  Get out there and stand up for freedom.
[02:56:18.118 --> 02:56:20.139]  Stand up against the New World Order.
[02:56:20.199 --> 02:56:21.059]  Defend liberty.
[02:56:21.579 --> 02:56:22.680]  God bless you all.
