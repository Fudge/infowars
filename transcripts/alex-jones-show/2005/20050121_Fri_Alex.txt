[00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:06.094]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:07.835]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:09.637]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:11.138]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:13.379]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.081]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:21.744]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:29.429]  Alright, massive broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:30.310]  The 21st day of
[00:00:32.688 --> 00:00:38.912]  January 2005, George W. Bush was coronated Supreme Emperor yesterday.
[00:00:38.932 --> 00:00:48.798]  I have just a ton of observations that I want to bring you about this ultra-socialist, ultra-communist president.
[00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:52.079]  Now again, I don't believe in socialism and communism.
[00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.681]  They're false political pretexts to confuse people.
[00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.122]  So is fascism.
[00:00:56.942 --> 00:01:01.165]  But if you want to go according to the popular understanding
[00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:04.942]  In the false paradigm of what it is to be a liberal.
[00:01:05.923 --> 00:01:10.065]  This guy out-liberals Bill Clinton by light years.
[00:01:11.346 --> 00:01:14.648]  But don't tell the mindless conservative followers that.
[00:01:15.748 --> 00:01:17.209]  No, never tell them that.
[00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.951]  Huge broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:22.772 --> 00:01:31.117]  Coming up later in the show, I'm going to do a little bit of rebroadcasting because I just got word that an old family friend that lives here in Austin, who I've known since I was a little kid,
[00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:32.609]  We're good to go.
[00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:03.706]  Need to, but we'll... It doesn't matter, because these interviews that I did, and the information I covered was really important, and I was already wanting to re-air some of these interviews, so that's coming up a little bit later.
[00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:04.586]  U.S.
[00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:07.668]  keeps locations of Iraq voting booths secret.
[00:02:08.108 --> 00:02:08.969]  ABC News.
[00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:14.652]  Now, first they said that we're not going to let you know who the candidates are running against the government candidates.
[00:02:15.265 --> 00:02:23.591]  Because no one's running against them, and so they can't tell us on the news there's an election without candidates, so they go, oh, it's secret, we're going to tell you after the election.
[00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:31.576]  Now, the voting booths are going to be secret until the day of the election, and then they say they may remain secret.
[00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:32.236]  Aha!
[00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:32.897]  Yes!
[00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:37.460]  This is so Orwellian, I don't even have words to describe it.
[00:02:39.401 --> 00:02:42.263]  So, we'll cover that article.
[00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:47.647]  Also, support for Iraq war hits new lows.
[00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:49.629]  This out of United Press International.
[00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:52.232]  And another article out of the L.A.
[00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:52.753]  Times.
[00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:58.500]  The FBI is now saying no credible evidence of Boston dirty bomb plot exists.
[00:03:00.262 --> 00:03:04.085]  And we put the comment here that it's the same modus operandi every time.
[00:03:04.105 --> 00:03:11.291]  Hype up the fake terror threat before a major event to make everyone paranoid and make the police more likely to be abusive.
[00:03:11.631 --> 00:03:14.754]  And then quietly admit there was no evidence for it in the first place.
[00:03:15.154 --> 00:03:18.377]  Then we have a link to the giant fake terror alert archive.
[00:03:18.397 --> 00:03:26.103]  Then under that we have the Associated Press article, FBI says no credible evidence, Boston dirty bomb plot exists.
[00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:29.672]  A great article out of the Daily Trojan.
[00:03:29.693 --> 00:03:31.233]  2005 is reminiscent of Orwell's 1984.
[00:03:31.453 --> 00:03:35.115]  That's what I was thinking last night watching the coronation.
[00:03:35.556 --> 00:03:36.276]  War is peace.
[00:03:36.336 --> 00:03:37.237]  Freedom is slavery.
[00:03:37.577 --> 00:03:39.258]  Ignorance is strength.
[00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:41.579]  And 2005 is 21 years too late.
[00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:50.864]  Most students read George Orwell's mind-blowing 84 sometime during high school, but many neglect the implications of similar events that are actually unfolding.
[00:03:51.665 --> 00:03:55.667]  I want to read part of Chuck Baldwin's Review of the President's Inaugural Address.
[00:03:56.964 --> 00:03:59.265]  He talked about the New World Order in the address.
[00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:10.548]  I was watching him when he walked down to the party last night, flashing the Diablo, or the sign of the devil, you know, that you see at the heavy metal concerts over and over again.
[00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:13.429]  And people said, oh, it's UT.
[00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.629]  He likes UT.
[00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:18.831]  So we have the Italian president flashing it.
[00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:20.331]  We have Tommy Franks flashing it.
[00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:22.572]  We have a whole Bill Clinton flashing it.
[00:04:22.932 --> 00:04:25.173]  They're all fans of UT.
[00:04:27.742 --> 00:04:36.005]  Of course, in the encyclopedia, they show the hand signal as the sign of the devil invoking the power of Lucifer or cursing someone.
[00:04:36.545 --> 00:04:37.986]  But again, that's not what this is.
[00:04:38.026 --> 00:04:39.527]  They all like UT.
[00:04:40.387 --> 00:04:42.488]  You know, we've got Francois Mitterrand doing it.
[00:04:43.288 --> 00:04:45.369]  We've got all these world leaders doing it.
[00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.590]  And they like UT, folks.
[00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.171]  It is not the sign of the devil.
[00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:52.411]  Skull and bones!
[00:04:53.432 --> 00:04:55.573]  They openly worship Lucifer there because they like UT.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.501]  It's about the University of Texas.
[00:04:58.521 --> 00:04:59.042]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:08.148]  If you're looking for a new way to clean the air in your home or office, forget about expensive HEPA filters or air ionizers.
[00:05:08.288 --> 00:05:13.332]  You need the all-new Ozone Light, and it's as simple as changing your light bulbs.
[00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:14.513]  Here's how it works.
[00:05:14.773 --> 00:05:18.316]  The Ozone Light's patented titanium dioxide coating
[00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:25.058]  Destroys odors, smoke and bacteria like no other air filtration system you've ever seen!
[00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:28.820]  HEPA filters and air ionizers simply trap the contaminated air.
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:37.663]  The ozone light fits in most standard light sockets and radiates light like a standard light bulb destroying all airborne bacteria and odors.
[00:05:37.843 --> 00:05:42.545]  If you have pets, if you have allergies, if you have a smoker in the family, even cigar
[00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:43.085]  I think so.
[00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:04.247]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:07.968]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.068 --> 00:06:12.009]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:18.391]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:18.792 --> 00:06:26.714]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.114 --> 00:06:27.655]  We're good to go.
[00:06:42.231 --> 00:06:46.016]  $90 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91, or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:52.363]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:52.423 --> 00:06:53.725]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:06:59.494 --> 00:07:01.015]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:01.196 --> 00:07:04.278]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:04.418 --> 00:07:08.322]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:08.362 --> 00:07:12.606]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:16.709]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:18.671]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:22.154]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:26.898]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.078 --> 00:07:30.141]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:33.163]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:33.664 --> 00:07:39.769]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:44.091]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:07:44.492 --> 00:07:45.872]  Order your video today.
[00:07:46.273 --> 00:07:48.854]  Call toll-free at 888-253-3139.
[00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:54.398]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:58.500]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:06.725]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.726 --> 00:08:23.667]  Thank you for joining us on this January 21st 2005 Friday edition.
[00:08:24.788 --> 00:08:26.488]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:26.628 --> 00:08:28.128]  Okay, I'm gonna start right here.
[00:08:28.968 --> 00:08:31.029]  I'm gonna start with the Diablo behavior.
[00:08:32.749 --> 00:08:37.050]  Number one, I got up early yesterday, started watching television, started taping it.
[00:08:38.792 --> 00:08:41.616]  And notice that there were no protesters on the parade route.
[00:08:42.698 --> 00:08:44.861]  By the time we got on air at 11 a.m.
[00:08:44.921 --> 00:08:47.704]  Central, we had protesters actually calling into the show.
[00:08:47.765 --> 00:08:49.507]  Later it was covered by C-SPAN.
[00:08:49.887 --> 00:08:50.909]  Nobody else showed it.
[00:08:52.049 --> 00:08:56.433]  Upwards of hour and a half to three hour waits to get in.
[00:08:56.453 --> 00:09:01.578]  I mean, the first person standing in line was held back for over an hour and a half.
[00:09:01.998 --> 00:09:13.288]  That way, when El Presidente drove up to be sworn in at 12 noon, no one had even been allowed through so that they could be protesting as he drove in.
[00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:17.612]  That's why all you saw was police and military lining the route.
[00:09:19.289 --> 00:09:39.138]  Then, by the evening, when he drove to the beginning of the festivities for the parties, for the parades to drive past him as he sat there and reviewed the military convoys and marching bands go past him, the people had been allowed through, selectively.
[00:09:39.198 --> 00:09:39.918]  Some were barred.
[00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:48.782]  And, again, they were only allowed into the second room, not into the final area right around the review stance.
[00:09:50.095 --> 00:10:00.777]  And if people got anywhere near these 20 foot in some areas, 8 foot in other areas fences, if they got within 10 feet of it, they were pepper sprayed!
[00:10:01.978 --> 00:10:02.918]  There's video of this!
[00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:03.998]  There's photos of this!
[00:10:04.518 --> 00:10:05.398]  This is the freedom!
[00:10:05.478 --> 00:10:07.379]  It's like Tiananmen Square or something.
[00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.939]  You get up by the parade route, and they spray you!
[00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:12.820]  In other areas, they did allow protesters.
[00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:16.155]  Dig it right up against the fences with their signs.
[00:10:16.655 --> 00:10:20.718]  But then I was sitting there watching Fox and CNN and ABC and MSNBC.
[00:10:21.119 --> 00:10:26.563]  And for 30 minutes of coverage, they might show 20 seconds of protesters at a distance.
[00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:34.890]  And then I noticed as Bush drove in his armored limousine to the parade route, to his reviewing box,
[00:10:36.249 --> 00:10:43.095]  Where Arnold Schwarzenegger and others were waiting for him, I noticed that every time I'd hear booing, the audio would fade out.
[00:10:43.215 --> 00:10:44.597]  And I didn't even have tape of this.
[00:10:44.697 --> 00:10:46.919]  I was taping on three different televisions.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:51.363]  And then I would flip to the next channel thinking, well, maybe that's a malfunction.
[00:10:51.723 --> 00:10:54.766]  It'd be a different camera shot with the audio faded down.
[00:10:55.698 --> 00:10:58.601]  Or I would notice I'd hear booing and you'd hear the announcer.
[00:10:59.041 --> 00:11:00.943]  And they had loudspeakers all over D.C.
[00:11:00.963 --> 00:11:04.126]  with this guy's voice going, Oh yes, here comes the President!
[00:11:04.346 --> 00:11:05.547]  Look at the beautiful parade!
[00:11:05.587 --> 00:11:07.409]  This is the freedom of America!
[00:11:07.709 --> 00:11:09.370]  And what George Bush stands for!
[00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:11.032]  What an incredible man!
[00:11:11.052 --> 00:11:13.694]  And I was like, are they actually saying this?
[00:11:16.296 --> 00:11:20.420]  Just this deafening voice, blacking out everything else that we were hearing.
[00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:34.137]  And then as soon as they got to an area, because again, they had most of the areas, and this was in the news before the inauguration, in the weeks before, they would give one bleacher to anti-Bush protesters.
[00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:35.438]  One bleacher.
[00:11:36.099 --> 00:11:39.321]  With hundreds of other bleachers for Bush supporters.
[00:11:40.761 --> 00:11:42.943]  And on top of it, you had to pay
[00:11:44.071 --> 00:11:50.913]  Between $75 and $150, depending on which bleachers it was, to be able to even get in the bleachers.
[00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:54.594]  That's why about a third of the bleachers were actually empty.
[00:11:56.694 --> 00:12:04.356]  But then again, you just had one bleacher that was for people that were anti-Bush there on the final parade route up Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:12:05.737 --> 00:12:10.338]  And then they told them, obviously, no crosses allowed, no anti-war signs allowed.
[00:12:11.354 --> 00:12:12.834]  And then this was selectively enforced.
[00:12:13.315 --> 00:12:14.955]  They did confiscate some crosses.
[00:12:14.975 --> 00:12:15.815]  This is now in the news.
[00:12:16.015 --> 00:12:18.116]  They did confiscate some anti-war signs.
[00:12:18.276 --> 00:12:19.436]  But others they let through.
[00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:21.517]  So it was all selectively enforced.
[00:12:22.677 --> 00:12:29.700]  Just a massive, massive brainwashing expo training us how to be good little slaves.
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.000]  And it went on and on and on.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.001]  Then I could talk for hours about a 17 minute speech.
[00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:37.462]  I've got the text of it and the audio of it right here.
[00:12:38.346 --> 00:12:42.728]  He gave a mention of a New World Order.
[00:12:42.788 --> 00:12:46.489]  He constantly talked about fighting tyranny and spreading democracy.
[00:12:48.129 --> 00:12:50.290]  You talk about Orwellian, it was double think.
[00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.771]  It was the complete opposite of what really happened.
[00:12:54.631 --> 00:12:56.672]  So I made a lot of different observations.
[00:12:56.792 --> 00:12:59.093]  I know you made those observations as well.
[00:12:59.293 --> 00:13:05.135]  And we're going to take calls in this hour, but because I want to give everybody a chance, I'm going to give each person 60 seconds.
[00:13:06.892 --> 00:13:10.253]  And if you've got a question, I will then comment on it for 30 seconds and that's it.
[00:13:10.733 --> 00:13:18.056]  So we will spend only 90 seconds per call because I want to give everybody else a chance to get involved on air.
[00:13:18.116 --> 00:13:19.756]  I've got my atomic clock in front of me.
[00:13:20.056 --> 00:13:21.317]  I'm going to hold myself to it.
[00:13:21.337 --> 00:13:22.317]  That's the real test.
[00:13:22.877 --> 00:13:23.538]  I'm the big mouth.
[00:13:24.058 --> 00:13:25.098]  And I'm going to hold you to it.
[00:13:25.118 --> 00:13:25.258]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:25.278 --> 00:13:25.418]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:13:25.458 --> 00:13:26.679]  Let me speed through some of the news.
[00:13:35.473 --> 00:13:39.955]  Illuminati devil hand signals prevalent throughout inauguration.
[00:13:40.855 --> 00:13:48.577]  We have noticed in the past the mainstream media would just carry these photos without attempting to whitewash what they were seeing.
[00:13:49.438 --> 00:13:55.220]  Bush and his entire family flashed so many of these hand signals today that they had to mention it.
[00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.401]  Yeah, I was watching him as he walked on the parade route.
[00:13:59.061 --> 00:14:00.161]  I have video of this.
[00:14:00.782 --> 00:14:04.723]  No fewer than ten times he flashed the Diablo.
[00:14:06.351 --> 00:14:09.092]  And there's three different Diablos in Black Magic.
[00:14:09.372 --> 00:14:12.792]  And we have the encyclopedia image of this listed.
[00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:13.392]  Okay?
[00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:15.253]  There are Diablo curses.
[00:14:15.733 --> 00:14:18.033]  There are Diablo power signs.
[00:14:18.713 --> 00:14:22.054]  And there are Diablo sacrificial signs.
[00:14:23.694 --> 00:14:26.035]  And we have them doing all three.
[00:14:27.495 --> 00:14:28.895]  It's the sign of the devil.
[00:14:29.796 --> 00:14:30.896]  Now, you're thinking, well, UT.
[00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.612]  You know, Bush and his wife didn't go to UT.
[00:14:34.672 --> 00:14:36.173]  His dad didn't go to UT.
[00:14:36.213 --> 00:14:37.854]  His mother didn't go to the University of Texas.
[00:14:38.135 --> 00:14:40.056]  But this is the UT Longhorn site.
[00:14:40.416 --> 00:14:43.519]  Okay, well, under this we have Bill Clinton.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.642]  We have the President of Italy.
[00:14:49.143 --> 00:14:51.265]  We have movie stars doing it.
[00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:54.647]  We have Elizabeth Taylor.
[00:14:54.667 --> 00:14:56.649]  We have Metallica.
[00:14:57.369 --> 00:14:58.730]  We have Tommy Franks.
[00:14:59.431 --> 00:15:00.792]  We have Prince William.
[00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:03.670]  And this is just some of them.
[00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:08.952]  In fact, for an upcoming film, I did probably about five hours of web searching a few months ago.
[00:15:09.853 --> 00:15:13.434]  And I needed to email these to Paul, because I called him last night and told him to put this article together.
[00:15:13.454 --> 00:15:17.136]  I appreciate him doing it, but I didn't do what I said I'd do in emailing the rest of them.
[00:15:17.156 --> 00:15:19.637]  But we've got, I don't know, about 10 or 15 of these posted.
[00:15:19.977 --> 00:15:23.959]  And I guess that Tommy Franks didn't go to UT, but he's doing it.
[00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:26.500]  As Bush gives a speech behind him, he does it behind him.
[00:15:27.221 --> 00:15:29.542]  And I guess Metallica's doing it, because they like UT.
[00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:31.663]  We've got Dan Quayle doing it.
[00:15:32.894 --> 00:15:35.895]  He, I guess, is a big fan of University of Texas.
[00:15:38.016 --> 00:15:41.398]  There are just a lot of people that like the University of Texas.
[00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:46.260]  Somewhere, I've got a picture of Hitler doing it, too.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.780]  He was a big fan.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.661]  You know Adolf Hitler went to the University of Texas.
[00:15:51.121 --> 00:15:55.063]  We have Maria Shriver doing it, who didn't go to the University of Texas, but she likes it, too.
[00:15:59.485 --> 00:16:02.186]  And so if you go to a Slayer concert, and they're doing it,
[00:16:04.209 --> 00:16:09.834]  You know, while they sing about the devil, just understand, it's really about UT.
[00:16:11.695 --> 00:16:22.164]  And of course, Skull and Bones, there's a Skull and Bones, the Order of the Death, sat on their door, and the Nazis also wore that on their hat, but that, too, being part of the Order of Death means you like UT.
[00:16:22.844 --> 00:16:25.647]  And when the BBC got the audio of them going, Ah, Satan!
[00:16:25.707 --> 00:16:26.647]  Devil equals death!
[00:16:26.908 --> 00:16:27.848]  Death equals death!
[00:16:27.868 --> 00:16:28.409]  Bleh!
[00:16:28.709 --> 00:16:33.153]  Or when I went to Bohemian Grove and they were worshipping Moloch, that, too, is UT.
[00:16:34.255 --> 00:16:42.202]  And when they bust in male prostitutes, headline New York Post, to serve the elite at Bohemian Grove, that, too, is University of Texas.
[00:16:44.544 --> 00:16:48.347]  And it's just all UT people.
[00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:55.293]  So again, the Italian president is a fan of UT.
[00:16:55.514 --> 00:16:57.155]  I've seen a picture of Ariel Ceron doing it.
[00:16:57.515 --> 00:16:59.157]  He, too, is a fan of UT.
[00:17:00.459 --> 00:17:04.480]  Anytime you see someone do this, it's because they're a fan of U.T.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:05.580]  Jiang Zemin!
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.021]  I've seen a photo of him doing it.
[00:17:07.281 --> 00:17:11.602]  It's because he's a fan, the former Chinese president, he's a fan of U.T.
[00:17:13.442 --> 00:17:13.802]  Alright?
[00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:24.605]  And so when police go to murder scenes and scenes of dead animals and see this symbol painted on the wall in blood, it's because they're a fan of U.T.
[00:17:24.645 --> 00:17:25.225]  Longhorns.
[00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:29.206]  It is not because they're calling down the power of the devil.
[00:17:29.935 --> 00:17:30.896]  Do you understand?
[00:17:31.216 --> 00:17:31.537]  Good.
[00:17:32.197 --> 00:17:35.941]  I'm glad the conspiracy theories have been pushed aside.
[00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:49.413]  And, you know, I was there at Bohemian Grove in 2000 and videotaped the satanic ritual, but they were worshipping Moloch, the most evil demon of the Old Testament, that children were sacrificed to, because they're fans of UT.
[00:17:50.939 --> 00:17:52.821]  All right, I've spent enough time on the University of Texas.
[00:17:52.841 --> 00:18:01.027]  You can read this article and look at them all, acknowledging the University of Texas and what big fans they are of UT at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:01.728 --> 00:18:07.973]  And I'm going to chastise Paul Watson for writing this headline, Illuminati devil hand signals prevalent throughout the inauguration.
[00:18:08.693 --> 00:18:12.556]  No, sir, they're fans of UT.
[00:18:13.597 --> 00:18:15.379]  All right, thank you.
[00:18:15.499 --> 00:18:19.122]  Bush makes veiled New World Order references in speech, CNN.
[00:18:20.211 --> 00:18:20.671]  Reporting.
[00:18:20.731 --> 00:18:23.432]  But again, it's not the New World Order when he talks about that.
[00:18:23.733 --> 00:18:24.913]  He's talking about U.T.
[00:18:26.874 --> 00:18:29.255]  The all-seeing eye of Lucifer.
[00:18:29.635 --> 00:18:30.935]  A raising above the pyramid.
[00:18:31.056 --> 00:18:32.656]  That is really about U.T.
[00:18:33.837 --> 00:18:38.779]  We have confidence because freedom is the prevalent hope of mankind.
[00:18:39.179 --> 00:18:40.599]  The hunger in the dark places.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:44.021]  The longing of the soul when our founding fathers declared
[00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:59.893]  A new Order of the Ages, when soldiers die and wave upon wave for a union based on liberty, when citizens march in peaceful outrage under the banner of freedom now, they were acting as an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.
[00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:05.114]  Ah yes, Order of the Ages, or New World Order that is on the dollar bill.
[00:19:05.754 --> 00:19:11.756]  The Latin motto, Norvos Ordo Seclorum, although the Founding Fathers didn't say that, they added that to the dollar bill in 1913.
[00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:21.652]  Novos Ordo Seclorum was suggested by Charles Thompson when he put together the final design for the reverse side of the Great Seal in 1782.
[00:19:22.092 --> 00:19:31.358]  On the base of the pyramid, the numerical letters MDCCLXXVI and underneath the following motto, Novos Ordo Seclorum.
[00:19:35.621 --> 00:19:36.502]  Then we get into
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:41.561]  Where it originates from, a Greek poem.
[00:19:41.621 --> 00:19:47.942]  You can go find out the actual history of it if you'd like, or you can just believe the lies and say it's about UT.
[00:19:48.863 --> 00:19:51.443]  It's all about UT, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:53.584 --> 00:19:57.425]  There's so much more news here, folks, so please stay with us.
[00:20:01.385 --> 00:20:03.906]  Hey gang, it's time for a fresh, healthy start.

[00:20:58.641 --> 00:20:59.382]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:20:59.722 --> 00:21:03.025]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:21:03.325 --> 00:21:07.909]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:21:07.929 --> 00:21:10.591]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:21:10.811 --> 00:21:12.353]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:21:12.733 --> 00:21:17.797]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:21:18.117 --> 00:21:19.339]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[00:21:19.399 --> 00:21:22.101]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:21:22.481 --> 00:21:29.205]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[00:22:01.081 --> 00:22:02.702]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:22:02.822 --> 00:22:06.884]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:07.064 --> 00:22:09.966]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:10.026 --> 00:22:16.749]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:16.929 --> 00:22:19.931]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:20.131 --> 00:22:22.532]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:22.652 --> 00:22:30.556]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:22:30.856 --> 00:22:42.119]  Maltazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:22:42.299 --> 00:22:50.041]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:50.061 --> 00:22:50.502]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:50.562 --> 00:22:52.222]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:11.245]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:23:12.326 --> 00:23:22.013]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:23:22.913 --> 00:23:29.498]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.
[00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:39.314]  We would like to send you a one-year, absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine that gives you the background of what is happening in America.
[00:23:39.894 --> 00:23:41.395]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.415 --> 00:23:41.735]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:41.915]  Call now.
[00:23:41.935 --> 00:23:47.498]  Our operators are standing by for an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:24:08.411 --> 00:24:12.014]  Coming up, I'm going to do a blow-by-blow analysis of Lord Bush's speech.
[00:24:12.054 --> 00:24:15.958]  I'm also going to read Chuck Baldwin's analysis of it, which is excellent.
[00:24:17.699 --> 00:24:19.441]  And there's just so much more coming up.
[00:24:21.451 --> 00:24:23.993]  Right now, let's accelerate through your wonderful calls.
[00:24:24.093 --> 00:24:25.554]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:24:25.594 --> 00:24:26.175]  Welcome, sir.
[00:24:26.675 --> 00:24:27.316]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:24:27.656 --> 00:24:27.976]  Hello.
[00:24:28.617 --> 00:24:32.560]  You were talking about the Novo Order of Socorro and putting it on in 1913.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.763]  Now, that's the same year that they passed the Federal Reserve Act.
[00:24:36.023 --> 00:24:37.404]  And the income tax.
[00:24:37.424 --> 00:24:38.405]  And the income tax, yeah.
[00:24:38.425 --> 00:24:48.353]  So, you can see where all of this... And the same year they gave us the 16th Amendment and took our senators from the states who were appointed by the elected legislatures and made them federal.
[00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.811]  Well, those dates are very interesting.
[00:24:50.831 --> 00:24:52.532]  There you have 19 and 13 again.
[00:24:52.612 --> 00:24:55.874]  Two sacred numbers to our friends the Freemasons, correct?
[00:24:56.314 --> 00:24:57.695]  But they like UT, sir.
[00:24:58.135 --> 00:24:58.576]  Oh, that's right.
[00:24:58.596 --> 00:24:59.756]  That's why they do all this.
[00:24:59.977 --> 00:25:01.918]  They're all great UT fans.
[00:25:02.118 --> 00:25:02.998]  Yeah, that's why.
[00:25:03.319 --> 00:25:08.001]  Now, wasn't Roosevelt involved with getting that on the dollar bill as well?
[00:25:08.782 --> 00:25:09.202]  In the 40s?
[00:25:09.222 --> 00:25:13.505]  No, it went on the dollar bill right after 1913.
[00:25:13.545 --> 00:25:14.045]  Right after 1913.
[00:25:14.425 --> 00:25:16.046]  Okay, thank you for correcting me on that.
[00:25:16.066 --> 00:25:17.047]  I was misinformed.
[00:25:18.077 --> 00:25:19.759]  Well, there were different types of money back then.
[00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:21.661]  They had silver certificates, all the different types.
[00:25:21.681 --> 00:25:23.042]  But it was on some of the money.
[00:25:23.342 --> 00:25:23.542]  Right.
[00:25:23.883 --> 00:25:26.585]  And the money today is nothing but a big lie, right?
[00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:27.145]  A Federal Reserve?
[00:25:27.185 --> 00:25:37.594]  We have an all-seeing-eye pyramid, a symbol of the secret societies on the back of the dollar bill, and our leaders are all doing the sign of the devil because they like you too, sir.
[00:25:37.855 --> 00:25:38.976]  But we live in a free country, right?
[00:25:39.376 --> 00:25:39.696]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:41.545 --> 00:25:42.305]  It's unbelievable.
[00:25:42.726 --> 00:25:44.246]  Oh, my other question escaped me on that.
[00:25:44.546 --> 00:25:56.352]  Oh, getting back to all of this, I mean, the basic root of most of the corruption in this country can all be traced back to there, where the Constitution was usurped, and they took control of the money, which, like a Federal Reserve note, is what?
[00:25:56.372 --> 00:25:58.012]  It's a unit of monetary debt, right?
[00:25:58.032 --> 00:26:01.754]  Because a country that's supposedly bankrupt cannot print their own money.
[00:26:02.114 --> 00:26:04.275]  Yeah, it's issued by a private corporation.
[00:26:04.615 --> 00:26:05.135]  I didn't know.
[00:26:05.175 --> 00:26:09.557]  Once again, I'd encourage all people to do all the research they can on that, and find out.
[00:26:09.637 --> 00:26:10.738]  I know Oaks
[00:26:11.388 --> 00:26:21.861]  It's hard for you to realize that your life and your country has been a lie, but the sooner you get the courage and the gray matter to fess up to that, that's when we're going to turn this whole thing around.
[00:26:22.141 --> 00:26:22.802]  I hear you, Tim.
[00:26:22.822 --> 00:26:23.603]  Thanks for the call.
[00:26:23.723 --> 00:26:24.764]  Tom in Arizona.
[00:26:24.784 --> 00:26:25.565]  Tom, go ahead.
[00:26:25.585 --> 00:26:28.409]  Hello?
[00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:29.490]  Yeah, okay.
[00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:30.491]  Ron in Arizona.
[00:26:30.531 --> 00:26:30.872]  Go ahead.
[00:26:32.583 --> 00:26:33.524]  Okay, we'll let him go then.
[00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:35.265]  Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[00:26:35.325 --> 00:26:36.125]  Emmett, you're on the air.
[00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:36.646]  Go ahead.
[00:26:36.926 --> 00:26:37.627]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:37.747 --> 00:26:38.007]  Yes.
[00:26:38.287 --> 00:26:44.171]  They should print a $3 bill with the bust of George Bush on the fascia of the bill.
[00:26:45.592 --> 00:26:50.455]  Did you happen to see the program by Peter Jennings on the ABC Network last night?
[00:26:50.796 --> 00:26:51.636]  No, I didn't see it.
[00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:52.857]  Limit of Control?
[00:26:53.898 --> 00:27:00.102]  It all verified everything you've been saying about they're listening in on our conversations, they're watching us.
[00:27:00.862 --> 00:27:05.825]  Oh, I got emails about that and they say something like, this is the way it is and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:27:05.885 --> 00:27:08.306]  Yes, and it's all for our safety against terror.
[00:27:08.406 --> 00:27:13.129]  Everything will be tracked and traced, every face scanned, every phone call listened to, but it's freedom!
[00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:15.250]  Yes, uh-huh, it's freedom.
[00:27:16.391 --> 00:27:17.211]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:27:17.431 --> 00:27:18.772]  What else did they do on the show?
[00:27:20.493 --> 00:27:25.636]  That's basically, they were showing where they're gonna watch with cameras.
[00:27:29.717 --> 00:27:32.079]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[00:27:32.159 --> 00:27:34.300]  Gavin in Rhode Island, you're on the air, welcome.
[00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:37.843]  Hey Alex, yeah, we're in big trouble as you know.
[00:27:38.163 --> 00:27:53.293]  I got AOL unfortunately, that good little globalist company, and yesterday on the main page they had a big article, Bush's new global vision, and then today on AOL they have a big home page article, is Iran next?
[00:27:54.261 --> 00:27:58.344]  And of course, what's the symbol as you're reading this on the AOL News?
[00:27:58.664 --> 00:28:00.705]  What's the symbol looking at you off the page?
[00:28:00.945 --> 00:28:03.967]  The pyramid with the all-seeing eye swirling in at you.
[00:28:04.187 --> 00:28:05.928]  But it's because they like UT.
[00:28:06.629 --> 00:28:07.930]  Oh yeah, they all love UT.
[00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:11.292]  Yeah, when they do the little devil sign at you, it's because they like UT.
[00:28:13.153 --> 00:28:16.995]  Yeah, it must be a good little globalist college there.
[00:28:18.638 --> 00:28:19.539]  But, um, I don't know.
[00:28:19.599 --> 00:28:23.983]  I mean, as far as people not seeing this, I mean, how can people not see what's going on?
[00:28:24.023 --> 00:28:29.167]  We talk about Nazi Germany was bad, and they had wars of aggression, concentration camps, and torture.
[00:28:29.747 --> 00:28:32.490]  And, uh, well, what is our government doing?
[00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:38.234]  I mean, well, fortunately, I mean, around here in Rhode Island, a lot of people are waking up.
[00:28:38.695 --> 00:28:39.896]  I mean, big time, so.
[00:28:40.583 --> 00:28:42.584]  Their New World Order system is coming down.
[00:28:42.604 --> 00:28:46.187]  Well, yeah, what, six months ago your governor tried to declare martial law.
[00:28:46.227 --> 00:28:50.650]  It was in the local newspapers, the Providence Journal and on the TV station.
[00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.331]  And the people got really angry and they had to withdraw it.
[00:28:53.872 --> 00:28:54.152]  Oh, yeah.
[00:28:54.172 --> 00:28:56.093]  But he openly tried to declare martial law.
[00:28:56.253 --> 00:28:56.654]  Period.
[00:28:56.674 --> 00:28:57.614]  Just said you're slaves.
[00:28:57.954 --> 00:28:58.415]  He did.
[00:28:58.815 --> 00:29:00.316]  But he got shot down big time.
[00:29:01.817 --> 00:29:03.358]  Tell me, what's wrong with martial law?
[00:29:03.398 --> 00:29:04.899]  It just means you like UT, sir.
[00:29:05.379 --> 00:29:05.780]  Oh, I know.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:07.461]  Martial law at UT is all good.
[00:29:10.898 --> 00:29:12.098]  That's about all I got, Alex.
[00:29:12.618 --> 00:29:14.539]  What did you think of the inauguration yesterday?
[00:29:15.899 --> 00:29:24.041]  Well, it's hard to stomach it, but I did notice that about Bush saying the new order of the ages.
[00:29:25.061 --> 00:29:27.042]  Yeah, which means new world order.
[00:29:27.882 --> 00:29:31.643]  It's like they say, we're not for global government, we're for global governance.
[00:29:32.501 --> 00:29:33.881]  Governance means government.
[00:29:34.061 --> 00:29:37.522]  Yeah, there's a difference there, I think, somehow.
[00:29:37.762 --> 00:29:40.883]  It's like, I'm not going to punch you, I'm going to throttle you!
[00:29:41.423 --> 00:29:46.165]  Alright, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, as they play their semantic games.
[00:29:46.905 --> 00:29:47.885]  We play ours.
[00:29:48.045 --> 00:29:48.585]  We'll be back.
[00:29:51.846 --> 00:29:52.786]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.227 --> 00:29:54.867]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.887 --> 00:29:58.448]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:48.361 --> 00:31:48.502]  1-800-419-WORD.
[00:32:01.698 --> 00:32:03.139]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.259 --> 00:32:05.661]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:06.021 --> 00:32:06.882]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:07.262 --> 00:32:08.483]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:08.803 --> 00:32:11.225]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:11.645 --> 00:32:15.027]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:15.468 --> 00:32:16.308]  Why else would the U.S.
[00:32:16.328 --> 00:32:19.290]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:20.811]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:21.272 --> 00:32:25.735]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:26.175 --> 00:32:30.158]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:30.678 --> 00:32:36.562]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:32:36.842 --> 00:32:42.926]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:32:43.447 --> 00:32:44.047]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:44.067 --> 00:32:49.691]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:50.131 --> 00:32:52.753]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:32:52.773 --> 00:32:53.333]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:33:11.328 --> 00:33:17.970]  All right, Gary and Robert, Mark and Vicki, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:22.491]  And we're going to spend about 90 seconds with each caller, because I've got a ton of other news I want to get to.
[00:33:22.931 --> 00:33:38.116]  Your chance to respond to what's happening with the ridiculous inauguration yesterday, and just all the different facets of talking about the New World Order, flashing the sign of the devil, fading down the audio of protesters' chants.
[00:33:39.324 --> 00:33:42.645]  Just all of the tyranny, and then the ridiculous speech!
[00:33:43.125 --> 00:33:44.865]  Just total lies!
[00:33:45.625 --> 00:33:48.066]  The arrogance of it, so transparent!
[00:33:48.966 --> 00:34:01.068]  And then now we've got Bush coming out with a faith-based initiative, Hillary saying she supports it, to federalize the churches, Alberto Gonzalez says he wants the assault weapons ban and more gun control, the NRA and so-called conservatives are silent?
[00:34:02.948 --> 00:34:07.069]  I'm glad there's some real conservatives out there, some real truth-seekers and freedom-lovers,
[00:34:07.904 --> 00:34:12.468]  I'm glad we're still here, because if this is what conservatism is, I'm a communist.
[00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:15.930]  You know, I'm against communists, so I'm a communist.
[00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:19.813]  I don't call myself a communitarian like George Bush does.
[00:34:21.395 --> 00:34:23.937]  But your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:24.897 --> 00:34:30.822]  First off, I just want to say, hey folks, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show on AM 1230 WJOB and AM 1420 WIMS.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:39.941]  I just love having these two new affiliates, both of which go into Chicago.
[00:34:40.021 --> 00:34:42.062]  One of them covers the entire city.
[00:34:42.082 --> 00:34:42.943]  They're in Indiana.
[00:34:44.563 --> 00:34:44.883]  Again.
[00:34:44.903 --> 00:34:51.266]  Hey folks, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show on AM 1230 WJOB and AM 1420 WIMS.
[00:34:52.226 --> 00:34:53.807]  That's how busy I am.
[00:34:53.827 --> 00:34:55.807]  I have to cut promos live on the air these days.
[00:34:56.448 --> 00:34:58.328]  Just having fun.
[00:34:58.749 --> 00:35:01.009]  Great to have those new affiliates with us.
[00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:02.310]  Alright guys, there.
[00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:04.851]  Now you have a little clip you can get and email to them.
[00:35:07.526 --> 00:35:08.947]  For like a week they've been going, cut these!
[00:35:09.007 --> 00:35:09.528]  Cut these!
[00:35:09.848 --> 00:35:10.669]  I'm like, I want to!
[00:35:10.729 --> 00:35:11.229]  I want to!
[00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:12.951]  I've just got so much going on.
[00:35:12.971 --> 00:35:14.512]  I'm trying to finish this new film.
[00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:20.317]  And I was going to come in this morning and cut these longer promos for these stations and some others.
[00:35:20.377 --> 00:35:21.418]  And then I get a call.
[00:35:22.138 --> 00:35:23.299]  Good family friend.
[00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:24.540]  Friend of the family.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:25.361]  Friend of my parents.
[00:35:25.881 --> 00:35:27.843]  Who I've known since I was about ten years old.
[00:35:28.323 --> 00:35:31.126]  Been on a score of vacations with.
[00:35:32.307 --> 00:35:34.669]  Died last
[00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:37.095]  Well, not last night, this morning.
[00:35:37.135 --> 00:35:38.075]  Early this morning.
[00:35:40.016 --> 00:35:44.339]  My dad got word he was dying, got up out of bed and was down there at 3 in the morning.
[00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:50.723]  I would have been there if I'd have gotten a call, but I got the call this morning and I've been trying to deal with that.
[00:35:50.743 --> 00:35:52.704]  You know, it's strange when friends die, though.
[00:35:53.164 --> 00:35:58.047]  When I was a child, when grandparents or great-grandparents died, you'd cry right away.
[00:35:58.067 --> 00:36:03.110]  But now I learn of friends and family dying, it's like it takes a while to soak in.
[00:36:04.372 --> 00:36:07.655]  And then what I'll do is I'll just wake up in the middle of the night crying, thinking about him.
[00:36:08.636 --> 00:36:14.080]  I haven't had a chance to do that yet, but my grandmother I love so much died over a year ago now.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:19.185]  When she first died, I was sad, but it just took time to soak in.
[00:36:19.245 --> 00:36:23.949]  It's a deeper type of grief, but I was real good friends with Dwight Wilson.
[00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:32.436]  And, you know, again, barbecues with him, and gone to the beach with him, and gone to the mountains with him,
[00:36:33.722 --> 00:36:36.063]  I've gone fishing with him so many times.
[00:36:38.023 --> 00:36:46.546]  He just... Well, he had an automobile accident many decades ago and the blood transfusion gave him hepatitis.
[00:36:47.866 --> 00:36:48.907]  It just ate his liver.
[00:36:50.487 --> 00:36:52.528]  And he's been in and out of the hospital.
[00:36:52.568 --> 00:37:00.050]  He just suddenly got sick and went into the hospital and went into a coma yesterday and died.
[00:37:01.815 --> 00:37:08.399]  But, you know, that makes me think that life is so short and it's all going to be over in the twinkling of an eye, folks.
[00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:13.262]  We might as well stand up for what's right and stand up for our children and their children's children's future.
[00:37:13.583 --> 00:37:14.623]  That's really what it's all about.
[00:37:14.663 --> 00:37:18.346]  These globalists are so evil, so wicked, they could care less about life.
[00:37:18.906 --> 00:37:23.829]  They try to hold on to life for themselves at the expense of everybody else and they're going to be defeated.
[00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.732]  Alright, let me just plug my videos and we'll go straight to your calls.
[00:37:31.744 --> 00:37:35.406]  9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny Special Emergency Release.
[00:37:36.267 --> 00:37:38.228]  I made this film about a month after 9-11.
[00:37:38.508 --> 00:37:42.471]  Because I had to get something out as quickly as possible.
[00:37:44.592 --> 00:37:49.235]  And I said that I was only going to offer it until the official 9-11 The Road to Tyranny came out.
[00:37:50.196 --> 00:37:50.776]  Which was in early 2002.
[00:37:53.590 --> 00:38:02.896]  Which is still heralded by many as the preeminent 9-11 film, because it gives you the big picture, the history of government-sponsored terror, and then what their master plan is.
[00:38:03.176 --> 00:38:15.645]  That's why it convinces so many people and wakes folks up when other 9-11 films don't, because they just focus on one or two 9-11 issues and not the big, not just the big picture of 9-11, but the big picture of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:38:16.985 --> 00:38:22.309]  But I said I wasn't going to offer this anymore once it came out on VHS, you know, for sale.
[00:38:24.247 --> 00:38:25.228]  And I'm a man of my word.
[00:38:25.248 --> 00:38:29.790]  A lot of people got mad and thought in some ways it was a better film than the official 9-11 Road Tyranny.
[00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:33.952]  So I thought, you know, I got a few copies of this laying around.
[00:38:34.452 --> 00:38:35.292]  I'm not going to sell those.
[00:38:35.332 --> 00:38:36.073]  I got about a box of 50.
[00:38:36.293 --> 00:38:38.854]  They just sit there on the shelf because I'm a man of my word.
[00:38:40.495 --> 00:38:42.896]  But I did put it on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:43.276 --> 00:38:44.417]  No sense in not having it there.
[00:38:45.157 --> 00:38:50.980]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you can go watch the emergency release.
[00:38:52.176 --> 00:38:53.316]  Which is all about 9-11.
[00:38:53.557 --> 00:38:56.217]  It is two hours about 9-11.
[00:38:57.538 --> 00:39:03.800]  Whereas 9-11 The Rotetarian, the big official one, is 9-11's 35 minutes of the 170-minute film.
[00:39:05.341 --> 00:39:06.521]  Which is what makes it so effective.
[00:39:06.561 --> 00:39:07.761]  Again, a big picture.
[00:39:07.881 --> 00:39:08.962]  Covers everything, basically.
[00:39:08.982 --> 00:39:12.343]  The whole cat and caboodle in the kitchen sink.
[00:39:13.517 --> 00:39:14.517]  And the bathroom sink.
[00:39:14.638 --> 00:39:16.958]  But this baby is a really good video.
[00:39:17.399 --> 00:39:19.899]  We've got it at high bandwidth and low bandwidth there for you.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:23.041]  If you're a PrisonPlanet.tv member.
[00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:24.981]  $0.15 a day if you sign up for a year.
[00:39:25.001 --> 00:39:28.403]  $0.19 a day if you sign up for a month.
[00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:29.683]  What, $5.95 a month?
[00:39:30.824 --> 00:39:32.324]  And we've got all 11 of my films.
[00:39:32.364 --> 00:39:33.464]  Now 12 films up there.
[00:39:34.605 --> 00:39:37.126]  And we've got dozens of other films we've been authorized to post.
[00:39:37.246 --> 00:39:38.566]  My book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:39:38.886 --> 00:39:40.007]  A bunch of other e-books.
[00:39:40.842 --> 00:39:45.766]  My weekly TV reports, other special reports, special interviews I've done.
[00:39:45.987 --> 00:39:52.412]  We're now posting old, classic TV shows I did five years ago.
[00:39:54.274 --> 00:39:57.056]  Really riveting stuff, never before seen outside Austin.
[00:39:58.538 --> 00:40:01.220]  Most of the really good audio interviews I do on the radio show.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:02.561]  It's an insane deal.
[00:40:03.662 --> 00:40:06.905]  For the cost of three cups of coffee, you get the entire week.
[00:40:08.526 --> 00:40:09.907]  And it helps us pay for the bandwidth.
[00:40:09.927 --> 00:40:10.587]  It makes it possible.
[00:40:10.607 --> 00:40:13.089]  Because I just couldn't continue without charging for something.
[00:40:13.709 --> 00:40:14.730]  Victims of our own success.
[00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:18.592]  You start getting 10 million individual visitors a month to the four websites.
[00:40:19.473 --> 00:40:21.714]  And, you know, I've got five servers now.
[00:40:21.734 --> 00:40:28.918]  I may have to add more so people don't get slowed down connections.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:47.599]  And then, in closing, if you want hard copies of any of my films, other than the emergency release, that's only for the members of the PrisonPlanet.tv, but any of my 11 films or any of the other films, go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart, read about the titles, watch clips of the films, get them, make copies of them.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:48.641]  Yes, I want you to make copies.
[00:40:48.881 --> 00:40:49.462]  I beg you to.
[00:40:49.722 --> 00:40:51.284]  Get them out to people, put them on AXS TV.
[00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:53.391]  Or call toll-free to order.
[00:40:53.411 --> 00:40:55.834]  You can ask about the different titles and specials.
[00:40:55.854 --> 00:40:57.615]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:40:59.117 --> 00:41:02.360]  And your purchase also makes this broadcast possible.
[00:41:02.861 --> 00:41:13.071]  I got three full-time webmasters now, two full-time employees, a part-time employee, and we are spending now every bit of capital that comes in.
[00:41:13.897 --> 00:41:15.938]  In fact, I never talk about this with my bank accounts.
[00:41:15.958 --> 00:41:19.059]  We're actually a little bit of reserves we've got are actually going down right now.
[00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:27.102]  I need folks to get the videos secondarily to also support what we're doing.
[00:41:27.502 --> 00:41:28.103]  So, 888-253-3139.
[00:41:29.043 --> 00:41:30.303]  And I'm working hard for you.
[00:41:30.323 --> 00:41:32.804]  18 hours a day over the last few weeks.
[00:41:33.325 --> 00:41:36.806]  But the last few days I actually just started going home and going to bed at midnight.
[00:41:37.866 --> 00:41:40.167]  I finally ran out of juice.
[00:41:41.168 --> 00:41:41.908]  Ran out of energy.
[00:41:42.893 --> 00:41:44.775]  Alright, let's go to the calls quickly.
[00:41:45.676 --> 00:41:46.517]  Who's up next here?
[00:41:46.557 --> 00:41:48.158]  I guess Gary in Ohio.
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.801]  Gary in Ohio, you're on the air.
[00:41:50.821 --> 00:41:51.482]  Thanks for holding.
[00:41:52.162 --> 00:41:53.223]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[00:41:53.744 --> 00:41:54.485]  Good morning.
[00:41:55.005 --> 00:41:56.887]  They couldn't watch too much of the coronation.
[00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:58.529]  I was getting sick to my stomach.
[00:42:00.316 --> 00:42:01.177]  It was quite an act.
[00:42:01.197 --> 00:42:11.103]  Listen, I told the video editor I was editing with last night, I said, I could make a film about that day of news, the propaganda, the doublespeak, the lies.
[00:42:11.243 --> 00:42:14.865]  I could make a film just surrounding and dissecting the lies.
[00:42:15.085 --> 00:42:16.986]  I mean, I tuned in and it was, look at her dress.
[00:42:17.066 --> 00:42:17.766]  Oh, she's so beautiful.
[00:42:18.007 --> 00:42:18.947]  Oh, he's such a leader.
[00:42:19.147 --> 00:42:20.348]  He's so serene.
[00:42:20.548 --> 00:42:21.689]  He's like royalty.
[00:42:21.909 --> 00:42:22.549]  Flip the channel.
[00:42:22.689 --> 00:42:23.630]  He's like royalty.
[00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:24.630]  He's so serene.
[00:42:24.811 --> 00:42:26.251]  They were reading off scripts.
[00:42:26.351 --> 00:42:28.833]  I have no doubt those reporters are all paid off
[00:42:29.233 --> 00:42:30.554]  Just like Armstrong Williams.
[00:42:30.574 --> 00:42:30.974]  Go ahead.
[00:42:31.534 --> 00:42:36.257]  Yeah, and it's funny how they're all saying the same thing, but... Listen, I'm not kidding!
[00:42:36.437 --> 00:42:45.241]  I've got it where I've got two TVs going, and I'm flipping with the channel changers through the news, and it's... they were finishing each other's sentences as I flipped channels.
[00:42:45.641 --> 00:42:46.222]  It's amazing.
[00:42:46.342 --> 00:42:47.903]  I'm not joking, people!
[00:42:49.543 --> 00:42:51.204]  We're supposed to yell and scream about this.
[00:42:51.244 --> 00:42:52.405]  This is insane!
[00:42:52.425 --> 00:42:53.786]  Go ahead, I'll shut up.
[00:42:55.406 --> 00:42:56.187]  Mr. Pervitin, sorry.
[00:42:57.472 --> 00:42:58.592]  Get your permission, Si.
[00:42:58.812 --> 00:43:01.633]  Yes, sir, I'm sorry.
[00:43:01.793 --> 00:43:03.194]  Got a dog out of control there?
[00:43:03.634 --> 00:43:04.754]  Yeah, you could say that.
[00:43:05.134 --> 00:43:18.818]  What I wanted to add a comment on is a comment that the Commissar Bush made comparing the teaching of the Koran to the Sermon on the Mount, and I just wanted to get your comment on that, sir.
[00:43:20.359 --> 00:43:24.180]  The Bible says Moloch is the most evil sub-demon under Lucifer you can worship?
[00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:28.315]  If your government worships Moloch, you will be cursed.
[00:43:28.756 --> 00:43:31.457]  But, according to people, Moloch is now Christian.
[00:43:31.998 --> 00:43:34.259]  Everybody flashing the sign of the devil is Christian.
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:42.925]  Worshipping the Koran, worshipping Shinto shrines, bussing in male prostitutes to service them, mainstream news, that is now conservative.
[00:43:44.025 --> 00:43:47.207]  It's amazing how conservative has changed so radically.
[00:43:47.227 --> 00:43:48.528]  Thank you for your time, Alex.
[00:43:48.568 --> 00:43:49.289]  Have a great day.
[00:43:49.329 --> 00:43:51.110]  My condolences on the passing of your friend.
[00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:52.551]  Well, thank you.
[00:43:52.671 --> 00:43:53.572]  I appreciate that.
[00:43:54.904 --> 00:43:56.106]  He's gone home to the Lord.
[00:43:56.746 --> 00:43:58.408]  Let's talk to Robert in Florida.
[00:43:58.468 --> 00:43:59.349]  Robert, you're on the air.
[00:43:59.369 --> 00:43:59.810]  Go ahead.
[00:44:00.210 --> 00:44:00.751]  Hey, Alex.
[00:44:00.791 --> 00:44:01.492]  How are you today?
[00:44:01.852 --> 00:44:02.312]  I'm good.
[00:44:02.353 --> 00:44:07.678]  Just, you know... I know you don't have much time, so I'll be brief here.
[00:44:07.718 --> 00:44:09.721]  This is Robert Revere here in Tampa, Florida.
[00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:11.983]  I've just got two quick comments for you.
[00:44:12.444 --> 00:44:16.108]  All laws now are in place, Alex, to finally implement martial law.
[00:44:16.698 --> 00:44:20.682]  And we have both Patriot Acts and this whole scare with the suitcase nuke.
[00:44:20.962 --> 00:44:23.465]  I agree with to get the police riled up for the inauguration.
[00:44:23.485 --> 00:44:24.826]  Well, it's always the same MO.
[00:44:24.866 --> 00:44:25.927]  It turns out it's not true.
[00:44:26.288 --> 00:44:30.852]  But, you know, something's going to happen so that they can finally implement these draconian laws that they passed.
[00:44:31.013 --> 00:44:31.954]  It's as simple as that.
[00:44:32.654 --> 00:44:33.836]  Now they've got everything set.
[00:44:33.876 --> 00:44:35.017]  They've got everything in place.
[00:44:35.137 --> 00:44:38.941]  Bush has got everybody into his new administration that he needs to be there.
[00:44:39.501 --> 00:44:54.253]  Also, my second comment, I saw the sergeant at arms yesterday, this is on C-SPAN, bringing the mace to convene the house just before the inauguration, and it just blew my mind, such a fascist ritual for democracy like we're supposed to have here.
[00:44:54.573 --> 00:44:57.275]  Well, for those that don't know, again, symbols mean things.
[00:44:57.395 --> 00:45:01.258]  They have Nazi symbols after 1947, they put them in the chamber.
[00:45:03.863 --> 00:45:10.007]  In the House Chambers, you have the bundle of sticks with the gold twine with axe heads on the top.
[00:45:10.167 --> 00:45:11.508]  That is the Nazi symbol.
[00:45:11.808 --> 00:45:13.529]  We have photos of Hitler with that behind him.
[00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:15.950]  The mace with the eagle and the spike on the top.
[00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.811]  All of it.
[00:45:16.851 --> 00:45:19.012]  But again, it's not because they like Hitler.
[00:45:19.332 --> 00:45:20.553]  It's because they like you, too.
[00:45:20.813 --> 00:45:21.273]  I agree.
[00:45:21.614 --> 00:45:22.674]  Hey, pleasure speaking with you.
[00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:23.254]  Good luck to you.
[00:45:23.515 --> 00:45:24.955]  Yeah, nice talking to you, sir.
[00:45:25.276 --> 00:45:26.476]  You know, this is part of freedom.
[00:45:26.676 --> 00:45:26.897]  Okay?
[00:45:27.777 --> 00:45:28.598]  Mark in Rhode Island.
[00:45:28.618 --> 00:45:29.058]  Welcome, sir.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:30.621]  How are you, Alex?
[00:45:30.641 --> 00:45:30.941]  Good!
[00:45:31.241 --> 00:45:32.142]  Good to talk to you.
[00:45:32.262 --> 00:45:35.664]  Listen, I don't have much feedback about the inauguration.
[00:45:35.684 --> 00:45:41.909]  I didn't watch probably much of it at all, but I do want to say something about the Mark of the Devil.
[00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:49.315]  I know you're good friends with Tex Myers, and I do go on his website occasionally and check out the information he has.
[00:45:50.336 --> 00:45:55.440]  He was offering a video or a book a couple of months ago where he had on
[00:45:56.397 --> 00:45:58.739]  Which is a four prominent, uh, televangelist.
[00:45:58.979 --> 00:46:00.120]  They're all very well known.
[00:46:01.041 --> 00:46:01.681]  All doing it?
[00:46:02.382 --> 00:46:03.163]  Yeah, all doing it.
[00:46:03.243 --> 00:46:04.644]  I mean, what is going on, Alex?
[00:46:04.684 --> 00:46:05.965]  I mean, these are well-known men.
[00:46:06.045 --> 00:46:07.326]  Well, they like you, sir.
[00:46:07.366 --> 00:46:08.307]  They like you, too.
[00:46:09.448 --> 00:46:10.689]  Oh, man!
[00:46:11.249 --> 00:46:18.295]  Well, I think, I think... Texas also got video of the preachers having people roll around like snakes and howl like demons and, oh, the Lord is entering them!
[00:46:19.216 --> 00:46:21.078]  Yeah, that, that, that, that, that's a little far out.
[00:46:21.098 --> 00:46:22.459]  I believe in being filled with the Spirit.
[00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:23.710]  That's a little over the top.
[00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.610]  One more thing, Alex.
[00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:28.051]  Well, sir, I mean, maybe these preachers, maybe the sign of the devil is Christian.
[00:46:28.071 --> 00:46:30.172]  I, you know, I don't know.
[00:46:30.212 --> 00:46:32.112]  The Bible does say... Maybe they like UT.
[00:46:33.013 --> 00:46:34.633]  That's what Reuters and AP are saying.
[00:46:36.174 --> 00:46:38.714]  Alex, who is, uh, who is a guy named Alex Constantine?
[00:46:38.734 --> 00:46:39.494]  Do you know much about him?
[00:46:40.875 --> 00:46:44.236]  Uh, yeah, I never interviewed him, but, uh, expert on the New World Order.
[00:46:44.756 --> 00:46:45.016]  Okay.
[00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:47.467]  Well, thanks for your time, Alex.
[00:46:47.587 --> 00:46:47.907]  God bless.
[00:46:48.148 --> 00:46:48.788]  Thank you for the call.
[00:46:48.828 --> 00:47:06.094]  And again, for those who just joined us, Bush all day, his family flashing the Diablo, and so we've got Dan Quayle doing it, we've got Bill Clinton doing it, we've got Italian President doing it, we've got all these leaders, Tommy Frank's doing it, and I guess they just all like UT, folks.
[00:47:07.174 --> 00:47:10.895]  They just, because that's what the news says, oh, they like UT Longhorns.
[00:47:11.935 --> 00:47:13.236]  Man, everybody's a fan.
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:15.681]  Vicki in Arizona, go ahead.
[00:47:16.141 --> 00:47:17.982]  Hi, I'm taking your advice.
[00:47:18.062 --> 00:47:27.368]  I went to the website and I went to propol.com to find out about the town, cities, and states who are rejecting the Patriot Bill.
[00:47:27.928 --> 00:47:33.031]  And I found a very huge number and it's growing, growing, growing.
[00:47:33.852 --> 00:47:41.516]  And not only towns and cities that are rejecting it, but also states and they're trying to enlist people to make
[00:47:42.037 --> 00:47:43.558]  Each state completes it.
[00:47:43.638 --> 00:47:44.739]  Everyone's rejecting it.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.864]  The problem is after the globalists blow something else up, they'll go, you caused this to happen!
[00:47:50.484 --> 00:47:52.186]  You didn't give all your rights up!
[00:47:52.406 --> 00:47:54.928]  Yeah, but how can they ignore that?
[00:47:54.968 --> 00:47:58.451]  Because this is under the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.
[00:47:58.491 --> 00:47:59.352]  They cannot do that.
[00:47:59.372 --> 00:48:01.233]  The state's right.
[00:48:01.273 --> 00:48:02.955]  We have a right to reject that.
[00:48:03.815 --> 00:48:08.279]  Well, we do according to the Constitution, but FEMA teaches the Constitution is a terrorist document.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.321]  I have video of them saying it.
[00:48:11.314 --> 00:48:13.414]  So we're not making any headway on this then?
[00:48:14.435 --> 00:48:15.795]  We're making massive headway!
[00:48:17.375 --> 00:48:27.738]  Uh, yeah, I'd like for people to get involved in on this because these websites that I came across and uh... it's in the uh... Bill of Rights Defense Committee.
[00:48:27.998 --> 00:48:28.278]  Yes.
[00:48:28.678 --> 00:48:38.420]  And uh... you can go to Google, and I Google them, google.com or dogpile.com and there's a list of states, so websites,
[00:48:39.304 --> 00:48:40.565]  I agree with you, Vicky.
[00:48:40.606 --> 00:48:41.587]  Good to hear from you.
[00:48:41.627 --> 00:48:43.008]  Let me just say this.
[00:48:43.028 --> 00:48:43.869]  A very prominent so-called 9-11 leader
[00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.391]  Has told everybody to give up.
[00:49:02.571 --> 00:49:03.532]  You can't do anything.
[00:49:03.572 --> 00:49:03.993]  Lay down.
[00:49:04.553 --> 00:49:09.778]  Folks, even if we were assured of being defeated, we have a moral obligation to stand up against evil.
[00:49:09.798 --> 00:49:11.099]  Let me tell you something.
[00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:14.062]  If we weren't exposing 9-11, we would have already had more terror attacks.
[00:49:14.462 --> 00:49:15.103]  We're winning.
[00:49:15.343 --> 00:49:16.784]  Everybody I talk to is waking up.
[00:49:16.964 --> 00:49:19.767]  I've done over 1,800 interviews on other talk shows.
[00:49:20.348 --> 00:49:22.189]  One out of 30-plus callers disagrees.
[00:49:22.590 --> 00:49:23.510]  Everybody's waking up.
[00:49:23.931 --> 00:49:24.571]  We're winning.
[00:49:25.392 --> 00:49:27.294]  And it's very
[00:49:28.561 --> 00:49:34.142]  It's saddening to see, you know, proud people going, going, oh, oh, no, nothing you can do, just, you know, go along with it.
[00:49:34.582 --> 00:49:39.483]  If we wouldn't have been doing this, if we wouldn't have been fighting, if you wouldn't have been taking action, things would be much worse.
[00:49:41.184 --> 00:49:43.744]  I mean, you can lay down to this, it doesn't make it go away.
[00:49:44.645 --> 00:49:55.867]  And it's very suspect to have people running around going, lay down, there's nothing you can do, you know, just forget about the 9-11 truth movement, you're not going to be able to, you know, get any justice.
[00:49:56.835 --> 00:50:01.819]  If we don't expose who's behind the terror, it doesn't mean people have to go to jail, because that probably isn't going to happen.
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.044]  If we don't expose who's behind it, they're going to keep carrying out terror and saying, give up liberty for security.
[00:50:07.064 --> 00:50:08.385]  When you give up liberty, you get security.
[00:50:08.625 --> 00:50:09.906]  No you don't, you get tyranny.
[00:50:11.507 --> 00:50:12.608]  And so we're winning.
[00:50:13.269 --> 00:50:20.014]  And now here as we're starting to win on many fronts, and winning the round, doesn't mean we've won the boxing match,
[00:50:22.589 --> 00:50:26.530]  Unbelievable, folks, to have people running around saying, oh, we're not going to win.
[00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.870]  There's nothing we can do.
[00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:34.511]  I mean, it's very demoralizing and sickening.
[00:50:35.811 --> 00:50:39.412]  So, I am not going to give up.
[00:50:39.852 --> 00:50:40.852]  And I don't want you to give up.
[00:50:40.932 --> 00:50:47.934]  We have a responsibility to warn people, to get involved, to become more informed, and to never surrender to evil.
[00:50:48.914 --> 00:50:49.634]  You give in to this,
[00:50:50.515 --> 00:50:52.977]  They're going to rape us up one side and down the other.
[00:50:54.418 --> 00:50:55.039]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:55.639 --> 00:51:00.703]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:51:01.184 --> 00:51:05.547]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.707 --> 00:51:10.171]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.291 --> 00:51:14.675]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.715 --> 00:51:16.076]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.856 --> 00:51:18.218]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.550 --> 00:51:41.994]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan-American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.174 --> 00:51:47.597]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:03.823 --> 00:52:08.745]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:52:09.005 --> 00:52:13.366]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:52:13.646 --> 00:52:22.569]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:52:22.769 --> 00:52:26.390]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:52:26.690 --> 00:52:31.719]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:38.772]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:52:39.253 --> 00:52:39.793]  What about you?
[00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:45.432]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[00:54:05.164 --> 00:54:06.685]  This show is documented.
[00:54:07.205 --> 00:54:09.906]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:10.367 --> 00:54:13.928]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:54:14.308 --> 00:54:19.070]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:24.252]  It burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[00:54:24.272 --> 00:54:27.954]  Yeah, the truth hurts, but it's better to know the truth than to not know it and live in total denial.
[00:54:28.074 --> 00:54:30.235]  Mike in San Francisco, California.
[00:54:30.295 --> 00:54:30.915]  Welcome, Mike.
[00:54:31.556 --> 00:54:37.960]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on and thanks for the unrelenting fight against the NWO.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:56.350]  I'm not going to give up either and I'm also a micro-broadcaster out here in South San Francisco and I didn't realize that when I was a teenager I was actually an unwitting UT fan when I would go to Ozzy Osbourne and Metallica and Iron Maiden type concerts.
[00:54:57.011 --> 00:54:59.072]  I didn't realize I was such a sports fan.
[00:54:59.764 --> 00:55:03.846]  Yeah, again, they're doing the sign of the devil, and Bush and his daddy and all of them do it.
[00:55:04.306 --> 00:55:09.548]  They didn't go to UT, but then we have all these other world leaders doing it, and then the news just says they like UT.
[00:55:09.568 --> 00:55:11.689]  Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:55:11.749 --> 00:55:17.352]  I think it's just total damage control because the photos are just out there all over the place.
[00:55:17.412 --> 00:55:18.853]  Well, why couldn't they control themselves?
[00:55:18.873 --> 00:55:21.194]  I mean, they were doing it on purpose, just constantly.
[00:55:21.914 --> 00:55:23.935]  Oh, they're just sticking it in our face.
[00:55:24.035 --> 00:55:25.436]  It's so disgusting.
[00:55:25.456 --> 00:55:27.376]  I mean, nobody can look at Bush.
[00:55:27.837 --> 00:55:28.397]  Come on.
[00:55:29.102 --> 00:55:31.263]  Well, that's freedom, sir, when you can't look at the leader.
[00:55:31.603 --> 00:55:37.184]  Yeah, really, I thought it was amazing to hear Darth Vader swear in Lord Bush last night.
[00:55:39.145 --> 00:55:44.326]  The way that Scalia was doing it, it was just like some bad Star Wars movie.
[00:55:44.426 --> 00:55:45.427]  I couldn't even believe it.
[00:55:46.087 --> 00:55:49.848]  Now, it was Chief Justice Rehnquist that swore him in.
[00:55:49.868 --> 00:55:50.788]  You talking about introducing him?
[00:55:50.808 --> 00:55:53.429]  Oh, yes, I'm sorry I got the name wrong, but yeah, exactly.
[00:55:53.649 --> 00:55:55.970]  I was hearing the audio track and
[00:55:57.014 --> 00:56:01.417]  You know, I know he's had some surgery, but that shrink tube, it made him sound like Darth Vader.
[00:56:01.438 --> 00:56:02.418]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.323]  Well, I hope that Rehnquist is proud of his voting record, because he's not long for this world.
[00:56:08.343 --> 00:56:10.004]  Yeah.
[00:56:10.144 --> 00:56:12.126]  Well, we don't need his maker soon.
[00:56:12.526 --> 00:56:13.607]  Well, we want to pray for him.
[00:56:13.627 --> 00:56:18.711]  You know, there's been a lot of people that at the end have come clean.
[00:56:18.931 --> 00:56:25.196]  We've interviewed daughters of Skull & Bones members, and boy, you ought to hear about the confessions.
[00:56:25.536 --> 00:56:26.137]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:26.858 --> 00:56:28.038]  Charles in Louisiana.
[00:56:28.079 --> 00:56:29.019]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:33.120]  Charles, you're on the air, bubba.
[00:56:34.401 --> 00:56:35.161]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[00:56:35.401 --> 00:56:35.821]  Good, sir.
[00:56:35.861 --> 00:56:36.482]  What's on your mind?
[00:56:36.502 --> 00:56:43.024]  Did you see on the inauguration where Miss Bush and Mr. Bush danced with the armed service?
[00:56:43.204 --> 00:56:44.665]  You know, they did a little dance.
[00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:48.006]  I guess to honor our military.
[00:56:50.805 --> 00:56:51.746]  Give me the particulars.
[00:56:52.006 --> 00:57:06.517]  Well, they come out in a little platform and they had a lady out there and Mr. Busch danced with her just for a few seconds and then the wife grabbed the guy and he took our service man and she made a little dance.
[00:57:06.937 --> 00:57:08.699]  I guess it was the Iron Isle Military.
[00:57:10.177 --> 00:57:13.080]  It is him for a few seconds, you know, not even 30 seconds.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:16.483]  Well, the Emperor let everybody know there were troops everywhere.
[00:57:16.523 --> 00:57:24.451]  The troops were engaged in law enforcement and Governor Ridge said this is an example of the integration of what the rest of the country is going to be like.
[00:57:24.652 --> 00:57:25.052]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:25.432 --> 00:57:26.533]  They made a little dance with him.
[00:57:26.573 --> 00:57:32.900]  They grabbed one of our partners and they danced for about 30 seconds with him, you know, to let everybody know how much they love our military.
[00:57:34.355 --> 00:57:36.578]  Uh, yeah, they love our military alright.
[00:57:36.818 --> 00:57:38.560]  Yeah, well let me ask you this, Mr. Jones.
[00:57:38.881 --> 00:57:41.564]  For a while you were talking about the military's guns were jamming.
[00:57:41.584 --> 00:57:42.886]  Did they ever get that problem fixed?
[00:57:44.079 --> 00:57:45.540]  No, it's pieces of junk.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.781]  Everything's falling apart.
[00:57:46.801 --> 00:57:53.726]  Yeah, well, we're getting ready to go to war with Iran, so I guess we're going to keep them boys there another year, two years, I guess.
[00:57:54.387 --> 00:57:58.349]  They told the National Guard, we've kept you two years, we're going to keep you in combat for four years.
[00:57:58.730 --> 00:58:01.051]  Well, I'll tell you, I'm back making tapes.
[00:58:01.091 --> 00:58:04.314]  I got my equipment back, and I'm still making more tapes than ever before.
[00:58:04.634 --> 00:58:05.955]  And I hope the rest of these people
[00:58:06.315 --> 00:58:12.578]  We'll just take the time to wake three or four other people, get the tapes and support the show, and let's get this thing on with.
[00:58:12.598 --> 00:58:13.398]  This is our year.
[00:58:13.438 --> 00:58:17.000]  We could do it this year if everybody just get up and do something.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.540]  We could really win this year.
[00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:19.181]  I really believe that.
[00:58:19.201 --> 00:58:20.221]  Well, we don't have a choice.
[00:58:20.521 --> 00:58:27.204]  And, you know, we think sometimes we're losing, but the minute we release our pressure on them, it's going to get a hundred times worse overnight.
[00:58:27.444 --> 00:58:29.885]  Well, people are waking up, and I thank you for what you're doing.
[00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:34.988]  I mean, you did a terrific job, and I'm with you every minute of the day, Mr. Jones.
[00:58:35.028 --> 00:58:35.528]  I really am.
[00:58:36.008 --> 00:58:37.229]  Well, God bless you, Charles.
[00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:40.031]  John and Rodney and others, you're up next.
[00:58:40.051 --> 00:58:46.115]  When we get back, the second hour, I'm going to take some time out to cover some other news as well and talk about some more of the inauguration.
[00:58:46.656 --> 00:58:47.096]  Stay with us.
[00:58:47.116 --> 00:58:47.797]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:57.384 --> 00:58:58.064]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.684 --> 00:58:59.805]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.466 --> 00:59:01.587]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.207 --> 00:59:03.068]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.788 --> 00:59:04.569]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.342 --> 00:59:09.266]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.526 --> 00:59:13.710]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.552 --> 00:59:20.877]  The great objective of ending tyranny is the concerted work of generations.
[00:59:21.598 --> 00:59:24.961]  The difficulty of the task is no excuse for avoiding it.
[00:59:24.981 --> 00:59:27.123]  America's influence is not unlimited.
[00:59:27.856 --> 00:59:36.178]  But fortunately, for the oppressed, America's influence is considerable, and we will use it confidently in freedom's cause.
[00:59:37.959 --> 00:59:43.460]  And he talks about fighting tyranny, and liberty, and creating liberty.
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:45.740]  America is falling under tyranny.
[00:59:46.181 --> 00:59:47.841]  The world is falling under tyranny.
[00:59:48.681 --> 00:59:56.063]  When our government went in and took over Iraq, they were taking over Saddam Hussein, who they put into power, who they told to invade Iran and Kuwait.
[00:59:57.113 --> 00:59:58.494]  But we're supposed to forget about that!
[00:59:59.314 --> 01:00:03.757]  And all this talk of freedom, all this talk of liberty, it is a complete fraud.
[01:00:03.777 --> 01:00:08.319]  I want to read some more of the quotes of Lord Bush.
[01:00:08.339 --> 01:00:11.601]  He says, We are led by events and common sense to one conclusion.
[01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:17.244]  The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.
[01:00:17.664 --> 01:00:25.949]  The best hope of peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world, i.e., global empire, global invasions, strike forces slaughtering everyone.
[01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:33.048]  So I want to analyze what I saw yesterday, what I witnessed, and some more of the speech coming up.
[01:00:33.408 --> 01:00:34.869]  Right now, let's take more calls.
[01:00:35.489 --> 01:00:37.090]  Let's talk to John in Oklahoma.
[01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.051]  John, go ahead.
[01:00:38.351 --> 01:00:38.791]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:39.091 --> 01:00:43.774]  I just want to remind the public out there that this is not a democracy, it's a constitutional republic.
[01:00:44.074 --> 01:00:44.655]  Big difference.
[01:00:44.695 --> 01:00:52.439]  In a democracy, if 51% say we're going to make black people slaves or we're going to make you pay 80% taxes, it happens.
[01:00:52.479 --> 01:00:55.781]  In a republic, everybody's got rights and the government's restricted.
[01:00:56.121 --> 01:00:57.023]  That's exactly right.
[01:00:57.364 --> 01:00:59.348]  And, uh, you were right about that scripted.
[01:00:59.408 --> 01:01:02.053]  It was kind of like the thing when it started on the old bullhorn.
[01:01:04.357 --> 01:01:05.480]  He didn't know what to say.
[01:01:06.435 --> 01:01:10.899]  They would just have lost the bullhorn, sir, but they couldn't go by the script any longer.
[01:01:10.979 --> 01:01:13.341]  Yeah, at first the media goes, what is that bullhorn?
[01:01:13.381 --> 01:01:13.922]  What is that?
[01:01:13.982 --> 01:01:16.264]  There were huge speakers all over D.C.
[01:01:16.684 --> 01:01:19.366]  and every time you'd hear a crowd go, you're a liar!
[01:01:19.547 --> 01:01:25.712]  You'd hear that audio faded down and suddenly this bullhorn would come on and go, oh, great leader!
[01:01:25.732 --> 01:01:26.633]  It was actually saying that!
[01:01:26.893 --> 01:01:28.074]  He's incredible!
[01:01:28.414 --> 01:01:32.438]  He's just blaring so loud everybody was like shrinking from it!
[01:01:33.138 --> 01:01:33.799]  Sounds like freedom!
[01:01:34.159 --> 01:01:37.040]  Yeah, they didn't know how to do real reporting, you see.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.101]  Because that was real reporting there, and they didn't know what was going on.
[01:01:40.201 --> 01:01:41.221]  It was funny.
[01:01:41.341 --> 01:01:43.242]  And then I would flip from channel to channel.
[01:01:43.262 --> 01:01:45.222]  They'd be saying, look at her, she's so incredible.
[01:01:45.622 --> 01:01:48.663]  Oh, it's Winter White.
[01:01:49.003 --> 01:01:49.884]  Oh, she's so beautiful.
[01:01:49.924 --> 01:01:50.424]  Flip the channel.
[01:01:50.664 --> 01:01:51.564]  Oh, she's so beautiful.
[01:01:51.744 --> 01:01:52.384]  It's Winter White.
[01:01:52.404 --> 01:01:53.225]  She's so incredible.
[01:01:53.425 --> 01:01:54.445]  She's such grace.
[01:01:54.705 --> 01:01:56.466]  She's going to be stepping forward in the next administration.
[01:01:56.486 --> 01:01:56.926]  Flip the channel.
[01:01:57.206 --> 01:01:58.866]  Oh, she'll be stepping forward in the next administration.
[01:01:59.246 --> 01:01:59.827]  Flip the channel.
[01:01:59.927 --> 01:02:00.927]  Oh, look at his serenader.
[01:02:01.227 --> 01:02:02.189]  He is such a leader.
[01:02:02.229 --> 01:02:02.850]  He's really grown.
[01:02:02.890 --> 01:02:03.391]  Flip the channel.
[01:02:03.631 --> 01:02:04.352]  Oh, he's such a leader.
[01:02:04.372 --> 01:02:05.073]  Oh, he's really grown.
[01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:08.078]  I mean, literally, it was a script on every channel!
[01:02:08.659 --> 01:02:11.042]  Well, I thought I had Alex.
[01:02:11.142 --> 01:02:15.449]  I just heard the democracy word again, and every time I do, I get angry and I just had to say something.
[01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:19.184]  Our Founding Fathers said democracy is deadly dangerous.
[01:02:19.544 --> 01:02:23.046]  That's the first thing they're going to institute to sell people to get this tear gas.
[01:02:23.066 --> 01:02:24.967]  We've got electronic voting machines.
[01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.848]  We won't even really be a democracy.
[01:02:26.888 --> 01:02:29.390]  They'll go, well you voted for toll roads on every road.
[01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:31.972]  Well you voted for face scanning cameras in your cars.
[01:02:32.272 --> 01:02:34.093]  Well you voted for a national draft.
[01:02:34.633 --> 01:02:36.014]  It's part of the takeover.
[01:02:36.034 --> 01:02:37.215]  That's what they have to do first.
[01:02:37.355 --> 01:02:39.856]  Get people to surrender their constitutional republic.
[01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:41.858]  That's all I had.
[01:02:41.898 --> 01:02:45.400]  What do you think of all the sign of the devil flashing?
[01:02:46.078 --> 01:02:51.422]  Well, you know, they talk about worshipping the God, stuff like that.
[01:02:51.442 --> 01:02:53.003]  That's what they have to do, you know.
[01:02:53.123 --> 01:02:55.766]  So, anyway, there's only one that I know of.
[01:02:57.287 --> 01:02:59.709]  Public, public acknowledgement.
[01:02:59.969 --> 01:03:00.929]  That's exactly right.
[01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:01.810]  El Diablo.
[01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:02.391]  Yeah.
[01:03:03.952 --> 01:03:05.953]  Alright, well, thank you for the call.
[01:03:05.973 --> 01:03:07.635]  Let's go ahead and make another call.
[01:03:07.655 --> 01:03:10.777]  Let's talk to Rodney and Tejas.
[01:03:10.817 --> 01:03:11.277]  Go ahead.
[01:03:11.478 --> 01:03:12.318]  Hey, hey, hey.
[01:03:12.378 --> 01:03:12.999]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:03:14.119 --> 01:03:15.420]  Uh, let me get straight to it.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:31.613]  Now, uh, you remember shortly after 9-11, our president, uh, when it was, uh, disclosed by the media that, uh, uh, the American public had been frightened so that they weren't riding airplanes, that basically our whole lifestyle had changed because people were afraid.
[01:03:31.653 --> 01:03:33.535]  So the president gets on the TV and
[01:03:34.715 --> 01:03:36.056]  Don't change anything.
[01:03:36.076 --> 01:03:38.638]  Keep living your life where you were before tonight.
[01:03:38.658 --> 01:03:39.559]  That's double speak.
[01:03:39.639 --> 01:03:42.181]  His menus create the fear that he comes as the comforter.
[01:03:42.641 --> 01:03:43.582]  I'll take care of you.
[01:03:43.842 --> 01:03:44.222]  Stay there.
[01:03:44.242 --> 01:03:45.003]  We'll talk about it.
[01:03:46.063 --> 01:03:48.065]  You take good care of us.
[01:03:48.565 --> 01:03:50.226]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.266 --> 01:03:50.867]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:03:52.944 --> 01:03:59.791]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.092 --> 01:04:01.473]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.673 --> 01:04:03.896]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.016 --> 01:04:06.138]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.398 --> 01:04:11.323]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.664 --> 01:04:15.688]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:15.948 --> 01:04:17.710]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:28.442]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.602 --> 01:04:30.465]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:30.845 --> 01:04:34.509]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Info Wars.
[01:04:34.649 --> 01:04:36.070]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.

[01:04:52.552 --> 01:04:58.781]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health, and let me tell you, I've found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[01:04:59.221 --> 01:04:59.542]  I use it.
[01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.885]  In fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[01:05:01.965 --> 01:05:03.768]  It's called the Sacro Wedgie.
[01:05:04.108 --> 01:05:08.114]  And it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[01:05:08.494 --> 01:05:13.736]  And what it is, it's a wedge device, just a small one, that you put underneath your sacrum.
[01:05:14.056 --> 01:05:15.277]  And then you get down on it.
[01:05:15.337 --> 01:05:17.298]  You put your weight down on it, on the floor.
[01:05:17.758 --> 01:05:19.559]  And you let gravity do the work.
[01:05:19.979 --> 01:05:24.001]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away, chiropractors go away.
[01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:25.161]  You don't need them anymore.
[01:05:25.481 --> 01:05:26.602]  You gotta give it a try.
[01:05:26.962 --> 01:05:29.103]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.
[01:05:29.663 --> 01:05:31.524]  Sacrowegi.com.

[01:05:53.539 --> 01:05:54.580]  The War on Terrorism.

[01:05:57.964 --> 01:06:02.109]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:06:02.549 --> 01:06:03.370]  So what do you do?
[01:06:03.691 --> 01:06:08.256]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:06:08.736 --> 01:06:10.858]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:06:58.837 --> 01:06:59.917]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.598 --> 01:07:01.718]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.358 --> 01:07:03.198]  You want answers?
[01:07:03.938 --> 01:07:04.899]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.499 --> 01:07:09.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.821]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:23.004]  All right, my friends.
[01:07:23.624 --> 01:07:24.564]  Your calls are
[01:07:25.465 --> 01:07:39.153]  Coming up here in just a few minutes, but I wanted to go over Chuck Baldwin's excellent analysis of Lord Bush's speech yesterday, because it just illustrates total hypocrisy.
[01:07:39.173 --> 01:07:48.018]  And then I could talk for hours just about the media coverage, the manipulation, the deception, all the bizarre Diablo hand-signed flashing going on.
[01:07:49.019 --> 01:07:52.041]  And on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com we posted
[01:07:52.791 --> 01:07:55.914]  It's all these examples of other world leaders doing this hand sign.
[01:07:56.514 --> 01:07:57.935]  Are they UT fans too?
[01:08:00.617 --> 01:08:09.244]  But here's a clip of Bush doing a veiled New World Order quote and then claiming the Founding Fathers were for this when that's just not true.
[01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:09.944]  Here it is.
[01:08:10.985 --> 01:08:12.346]  The longing of the soul.
[01:08:14.388 --> 01:08:16.870]  When our founders declared a new order of the ages,
[01:08:18.297 --> 01:08:22.840]  When soldiers died in wave upon wave for a union based on liberty.
[01:08:25.061 --> 01:08:29.083]  When citizens marched in peaceful outrage under the banner of freedom now.
[01:08:30.844 --> 01:08:35.026]  They were acting on an ancient hope that is meant to be fulfilled.
[01:08:37.127 --> 01:08:46.933]  History has an ebb and flow of justice, but history also has a visible direction set by liberty and the author of liberty.
[01:08:51.118 --> 01:08:55.020]  Alright, so there's all these invoking of God.
[01:08:55.981 --> 01:09:00.143]  He even talked about the Koran in his little diatribe.
[01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:06.006]  It's amazing propaganda, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:09:06.026 --> 01:09:09.588]  I mean, Bill Clinton constantly talked about God.
[01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:14.471]  And are we then going to believe that?
[01:09:14.511 --> 01:09:18.593]  Are we then going to buy into what he has to say?
[01:09:19.954 --> 01:09:20.494]  Are we really?
[01:09:21.314 --> 01:09:21.934]  This is stupid.
[01:09:23.515 --> 01:09:26.716]  Why are we putting up with this propaganda?
[01:09:26.756 --> 01:09:27.816]  We shouldn't do it.
[01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:29.736]  Who's up first here?
[01:09:29.816 --> 01:09:30.857]  I guess Rodney in Texas.
[01:09:31.257 --> 01:09:32.517]  Rodney, finish up what you were saying.
[01:09:32.797 --> 01:09:38.539]  Yes, by the way, I wanted to tell you that a caller called in to C-SPAN this morning with Brian Lamb.
[01:09:39.319 --> 01:09:45.561]  Strongly suggested that he have Alex Jones on C-SPAN with Brian Lamb.
[01:09:45.621 --> 01:09:49.362]  And Brian Lamb looked like he had been hit by a karate chop when the guy asked
[01:09:50.894 --> 01:09:52.497]  He didn't know how to reply to that.
[01:09:53.118 --> 01:09:53.879]  What did he say?
[01:09:54.900 --> 01:09:58.526]  There was a five second pause by Brian Lamb.
[01:09:59.252 --> 01:10:04.975]  And when the caller realized he wasn't going to respond to his request, he just went ahead on and continued.
[01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:07.996]  Did he drop an InfoWars.com on him?
[01:10:08.277 --> 01:10:09.377]  No, he didn't do that.
[01:10:09.437 --> 01:10:18.101]  I mean, I think the caller was looking at the screen just like I was, and he could see Brian Lamb was just, like I said, he looked like... Well, these guys are scared to death of me.
[01:10:18.121 --> 01:10:18.742]  I don't know why.
[01:10:18.762 --> 01:10:27.366]  He spent an hour and a half attacking me with some New World Order Secret Society expert, and I just don't understand it anymore.
[01:10:28.434 --> 01:10:33.097]  I don't know why they spend all day attacking me, and I don't know why they won't have me on C-SPAN.
[01:10:33.337 --> 01:10:34.918]  I think you're doing something right, Alec.
[01:10:35.339 --> 01:10:38.801]  I still engaged in a sneak attack on them at the RNC when I got on C-SPAN.
[01:10:38.861 --> 01:10:39.921]  Did you ever see that?
[01:10:39.941 --> 01:10:40.102]  Oh yeah.
[01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:40.962]  It was pretty good.
[01:10:41.002 --> 01:10:42.343]  But I want to also say this.
[01:10:52.426 --> 01:11:01.351]  In his speech, he used the word, and I'm quoting what Brian Lamb was reading out of Wall Street Journal this morning, the word, freedom, 27 times.
[01:11:04.867 --> 01:11:09.450]  Didn't he just sign off on something called an initiative with the word freedom in front of it?
[01:11:09.850 --> 01:11:16.294]  Yeah, the new freedom initiative, forced psychological testing of every school child in America, and then up to women, age 18, and forced drugging.
[01:11:16.555 --> 01:11:21.438]  Now isn't that just another example of his devil speak and hypocrisy?
[01:11:21.818 --> 01:11:24.079]  Rodney, I'm going to be honest with you and I appreciate the call.
[01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:29.543]  I could make a whole film about what I saw in the morning and in the evening yesterday.
[01:11:29.563 --> 01:11:30.884]  I did watch some TV yesterday.
[01:11:32.173 --> 01:11:35.476]  They were fading down the protesters' chants where you couldn't hear them openly.
[01:11:35.496 --> 01:11:36.857]  They would just fade it down on the news.
[01:11:36.877 --> 01:11:38.698]  I'd have flipped to the next channel, same thing.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.882]  Bush and his entourage were all flashing the yablo.
[01:11:45.704 --> 01:11:47.685]  You know, the sign of the devil, constantly.
[01:11:48.246 --> 01:11:54.331]  Nothing to do with UT boys and girls, or I guess all these other world leaders we have photos of doing it too.
[01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.953]  His speech was total 1984.
[01:11:56.993 --> 01:12:00.656]  I could take each sentence and spend an hour on it showing how it's all lies.
[01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:10.512]  The troops, ordering the cops around, running it, violation of posse comitatus, all of it.
[01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:13.455]  But let me try to do this some justice right now.
[01:12:13.476 --> 01:12:15.759]  This is Chuck Baldwin, a real conservative.
[01:12:16.439 --> 01:12:20.545]  He was the vice presidential candidate with Michael Perutka for the Constitution Party.
[01:12:21.155 --> 01:12:23.116]  A review of the President's inaugural address.
[01:12:23.156 --> 01:12:27.859]  Yesterday, President George W. Bush took the oath of office and delivered his second inaugural address.
[01:12:28.339 --> 01:12:33.262]  As political speeches go, this was a rather brief, only assuming four typewritten pages.
[01:12:33.362 --> 01:12:33.722]  However,
[01:12:35.501 --> 01:12:38.923]  Following our exceptions, along with my abbreviated comments.
[01:12:39.343 --> 01:12:45.085]  Quote, I am determined to fulfill the oath that I have sworn and you have witnessed, President Bush, yesterday.
[01:12:45.566 --> 01:13:01.913]  Unfortunately, President Bush either has no intention of fulfilling his oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, or he has no inclination as to what the Constitution says, because virtually everything he has done since being elected in 2000 has been egregiously unconstitutional.
[01:13:02.831 --> 01:13:23.041]  From expanding unconstitutional federal funding and oversight for public education and intensifying unconstitutional federal police encroachments upon our freedoms and liberties via the Department of Homeland Security and Patriot Acts, to unilaterally and unconstitutionally ordering the invasion and occupation of Iraq, President Bush has demonstrated a callous disregard for the Constitution.
[01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:30.145]  But now proclaim that he is determined to fulfill his oath that I have sworn, close quote, is meaningless rhetoric.
[01:13:31.781 --> 01:13:33.004]  I call it bald-faced lies.
[01:13:34.467 --> 01:13:41.561]  The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world, President Bush in the inaugural address yesterday.
[01:13:43.061 --> 01:13:47.424]  This statement formed a redundant theme throughout the President's speech.
[01:13:47.464 --> 01:13:57.512]  For example, Bush also said the ultimate goal of ending tyranny around the world and one day this untamed fire of freedom will reach the darkest corners of our world.
[01:13:57.932 --> 01:14:05.017]  Still other similar statements included the global appeal for liberty and a moving world towards liberty, etc.
[01:14:05.097 --> 01:14:05.177]  etc.
[01:14:06.318 --> 01:14:08.540]  The tenor and tone of the President's speech are very clear.
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:13.663]  George W. Bush intends to use America's armed forces for imperialistic and expansionist purposes.
[01:14:14.023 --> 01:14:22.949]  Therefore, I believe it is all but certain that Bush will order our troops to invade and occupy Iran, Syria, perhaps even plans to attack North Korea.
[01:14:23.429 --> 01:14:32.255]  It is yet to be seen how long Bush's military aggression will be tolerated by the American people after all the costs in terms of American lives and tax dollars are, so far, incalculable.
[01:14:32.916 --> 01:14:37.304]  One thing is certain, we have not yet begun to see the tip of the proverbial iceberg.
[01:14:37.865 --> 01:14:43.295]  Quote, the United States will not ignore your oppression or excuse your oppressors.
[01:14:44.469 --> 01:14:46.911]  Of course the United States has ignored oppression for decades.
[01:14:47.371 --> 01:14:50.273]  Two of the most egregious examples are China and the Sudan.
[01:14:50.714 --> 01:14:55.777]  The Communist Chinese government is one of the most prolific murder machines in world history.
[01:14:56.258 --> 01:14:57.318]  It's the most murderous.
[01:14:57.599 --> 01:15:03.503]  The toll of oppression and death inflicted upon the Chinese people by the killing machine is impossible to calculate.
[01:15:04.221 --> 01:15:10.165]  Yet the United States has invested billions of trade dollars in the monster with absolute disregard for the suffering souls of China.
[01:15:10.486 --> 01:15:22.734]  President Bush has continued the one-child policy of his predecessors and has freely imported Chinese slave labor products to the point that the American manufacturing base has all but disappeared and our trade deficits continue to break all-time records.
[01:15:24.636 --> 01:15:27.758]  Oh, I couldn't say it any better, Mr. Baldwin.
[01:15:29.159 --> 01:15:30.320]  Likewise, Chinese
[01:15:31.278 --> 01:15:34.541]  Lover, Chinese Communist lover, Bush.
[01:15:35.462 --> 01:15:36.062]  I added that.
[01:15:36.142 --> 01:15:40.446]  Likewise, President Bush has turned a blind eye to the suffering people of the Sudan.
[01:15:40.826 --> 01:15:47.832]  The Chinese-sponsored government has murdered more than two million people during the past two decades with utter impunity.
[01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:52.275]  The oppression and brutality inflicted upon the Sudanese peoples staggers the imagination.
[01:15:52.395 --> 01:15:53.316]  Men are crucified.
[01:15:53.376 --> 01:15:54.978]  Women are raped into submission.
[01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:56.579]  Children are tortured and sold into slavery.
[01:15:56.859 --> 01:15:58.981]  Yet the White House seems totally oblivious to their plight.
[01:16:00.467 --> 01:16:03.788]  The unwanted have worth, President Bush said yesterday.
[01:16:03.808 --> 01:16:10.631]  I would like to believe that President Bush would include unborn babies in this statement, but his actions on the subject prove otherwise.
[01:16:11.171 --> 01:16:18.034]  More than 4 million unborn babies have been mercilessly slaughtered in the wombs of their mothers since George W. Bush took office in 1901.
[01:16:18.434 --> 01:16:22.676]  Abortion on demand is still practice undaunted in the United States.
[01:16:22.876 --> 01:16:24.957]  Rhetoric to the contrary notwithstanding.
[01:16:25.672 --> 01:16:30.497]  Regarding abortion, President Bush and his fellow Republicans in Congress have proven to be paper tigers.
[01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:37.264]  They talk pro-life during the election campaign season, but they have no intention of actually saving the lives of the unborn.
[01:16:37.804 --> 01:16:47.514]  Even the partial birth abortion bill, which Congress passed and President Bush signed, is nothing but an elaborate ruse to make Christians and pro-lifers feel good about voting Republican.
[01:16:48.780 --> 01:16:50.541]  There is nothing of substance to it.
[01:16:51.101 --> 01:17:04.510]  If anything, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Bill serves to cement abortion on demand into the legal fabric of America by signaling out only one abortion procedure, the least one used, no less.
[01:17:04.610 --> 01:17:07.011]  It accounts for less than 1% of all abortions.
[01:17:07.331 --> 01:17:11.774]  All remaining abortion procedures are thereby certified to be tolerated and legal.
[01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:14.996]  Beyond that, President Bush has increased funding
[01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:19.762]  for both domestic and overseas abortion providers to record numbers.
[01:17:20.302 --> 01:17:26.626]  He has consistently refused to make the life issue pertinent to the selection of federal judges.
[01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:35.472]  In fact, reports I have read indicate that no less than two-thirds of the judiciary appointments to date are either neutral or lean to pro-abortion.
[01:17:35.893 --> 01:17:37.314]  Yes, Specter and all these people.
[01:17:37.694 --> 01:17:40.596]  That is hardly the track record of a true pro-life leader.
[01:17:41.332 --> 01:17:50.802]  Add the fact that both Congress and the President have the authority to end abortion on demand any time they would choose to do so, and one easily sees through Bush's pro-life facade.
[01:17:53.124 --> 01:17:56.207]  And it goes on and on, my friends.
[01:17:58.129 --> 01:18:00.272]  But again, that is only the tip of the iceberg.
[01:18:00.352 --> 01:18:03.375]  It's impossible to chronicle the lies.
[01:18:04.611 --> 01:18:07.616]  Then there's the lavish worship of the so-called liberal media.
[01:18:07.656 --> 01:18:08.637]  I mean, every channel.
[01:18:08.978 --> 01:18:19.134]  I would flip channel to channel and they were finishing each other's sentences, obviously reading off a script that would make Armstrong Williams blush.
[01:18:20.208 --> 01:18:36.180]  I mean, they were literally, I have it on video, as I would flip channels real time, they were finishing each other's sentences, and I thought, it's gotta be a coincidence, and I kept flipping, and they kept finishing each other's sentences, channel by channel, CNN, Fox, CNN to MSNBC, CNN, and just over and over again.
[01:18:38.201 --> 01:18:45.867]  Literally finishing each other's sentences, repeating each other's sentences, reading off scripts, ladies and gentlemen, calling him royal.
[01:18:46.576 --> 01:18:51.099]  Calling him wonderful, calling him serene, calling him... It was disgusting!
[01:18:53.221 --> 01:18:54.802]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:55.183 --> 01:19:00.927]  You know that murky water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:19:01.187 --> 01:19:06.331]  The murky light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:19:06.651 --> 01:19:09.013]  The self-sterilizing black murky elements remove
[01:19:09.053 --> 01:19:09.533]  We're good to go!
[01:19:30.894 --> 01:19:35.136]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America by the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:20:01.303 --> 01:20:05.366]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:20:06.087 --> 01:20:13.152]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain and Western Europe.
[01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:22.800]  You need to know as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:28.544]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:55.191 --> 01:21:59.774]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:22:00.115 --> 01:22:02.456]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:22:02.676 --> 01:22:04.217]  Achieve financial independence.

[01:22:54.165 --> 01:22:59.329]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:22:59.989 --> 01:23:02.310]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:07.029 --> 01:23:10.754]  Alright, support for the Iraq War hits new low.
[01:23:12.937 --> 01:23:20.067]  Only 39% of Americans think the war is bad, but another major opinion poll
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:26.683]  Shows that only 42% would support invading Iran.
[01:23:26.783 --> 01:23:31.526]  How do you have a poll where more people are against the Iraq War than would be against going into Iran?
[01:23:31.546 --> 01:23:34.608]  It shows most Americans get the two names confused.
[01:23:35.009 --> 01:23:35.969]  And polls have shown that.
[01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:37.831]  That's scary, people.
[01:23:39.011 --> 01:23:40.532]  And, well, they might get nukes.
[01:23:40.612 --> 01:23:42.454]  Why, Bush says they might have them.
[01:23:42.474 --> 01:23:44.455]  And then John Kerry's for invading.
[01:23:44.475 --> 01:23:45.195]  So is Hillary.
[01:23:45.756 --> 01:23:46.696]  Oh, well, it must be good.
[01:23:46.736 --> 01:23:48.257]  She's for taking over the churches, too.
[01:23:48.598 --> 01:23:49.838]  With a face-to-face initiative.
[01:23:49.878 --> 01:23:50.619]  She loves Bush.
[01:23:51.633 --> 01:23:53.194]  I'm against Bush and Hillary Clinton.
[01:23:53.955 --> 01:23:55.796]  It's just getting crazier and crazier.
[01:23:56.096 --> 01:23:57.937]  But don't worry, the globalists blow something up.
[01:23:58.037 --> 01:23:59.698]  We'll all be for invading Iran.
[01:24:00.879 --> 01:24:02.800]  It's just mind-boggling.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:03.901]  Let's go to the calls quickly.
[01:24:04.101 --> 01:24:06.102]  Fred in New Mexico, go ahead.
[01:24:06.122 --> 01:24:08.343]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:10.325]  I wanted to ask you a question.
[01:24:10.505 --> 01:24:16.368]  Do laser beams damage all these TV cameras we see on our stoplights all around the country?
[01:24:17.109 --> 01:24:19.350]  A high-powered one, not the toy ones.
[01:24:19.730 --> 01:24:20.511]  Not the toy ones, huh?
[01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:22.109]  Okay, that's all I got.
[01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.470]  Thank you.
[01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:23.690]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:29.612]  I guess if you, you know, aimed a medium power when it went long enough, close enough, it might burn something out.
[01:24:30.372 --> 01:24:35.234]  The answer is, not going and getting rid of individual cameras, it's getting rid of the whole system.
[01:24:35.594 --> 01:24:36.494]  Showing it's a fraud.
[01:24:36.514 --> 01:24:39.235]  Say, how about you take all the cameras off our streets and put them on the border?
[01:24:39.455 --> 01:24:40.756]  Oh no, can't do that, can't do that.
[01:24:41.725 --> 01:24:43.527]  Let's talk to Skip in California.
[01:24:43.567 --> 01:24:44.308]  Skip, go ahead.
[01:24:44.848 --> 01:24:45.709]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:46.509 --> 01:24:53.956]  I know you get tired of hearing it, but just thanks for being such an inspiration and such a fine example for everybody what we should be doing.
[01:24:55.117 --> 01:25:04.245]  What I wanted to talk to you about was this propaganda that they're putting out, the fake stories that they pay to have out there.
[01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:08.609]  I was listening to NPR in the car the other day, and well, I think it was yesterday,
[01:25:09.284 --> 01:25:16.346]  And they had this little story on about, it was like an infomercial for old guys to join up, and it was all the emotional hook.
[01:25:16.366 --> 01:25:21.107]  They got caught in another infomercial that wasn't really news, it was an ad for two different beer companies.
[01:25:21.847 --> 01:25:23.867]  But that's product placement, that's nothing.
[01:25:24.208 --> 01:25:30.269]  Propaganda placement, and I know this for a fact, thousands of prominent media are paid by the government.
[01:25:30.569 --> 01:25:34.652]  Well, this is an example of... I know that this was not a straight story.
[01:25:34.672 --> 01:25:36.513]  They acted like it was a story.
[01:25:36.713 --> 01:25:38.795]  They did everything but play the Army theme song.
[01:25:39.055 --> 01:25:41.977]  They had all the stuff in there for getting old guys to join up.
[01:25:42.517 --> 01:25:43.758]  And it's on their site now.
[01:25:43.798 --> 01:25:46.520]  You can go listen to it if you want, or I could send you a copy of it.
[01:25:46.540 --> 01:25:47.761]  Well, I mean, I want people to listen.
[01:25:48.061 --> 01:25:54.845]  Is this freedom to have most of our mainstream media, and it's most of them, being paid checks by the federal government?
[01:25:55.005 --> 01:25:55.266]  Right.
[01:25:55.426 --> 01:25:58.127]  And this was a disgustingly... Again, this is a big, dirty secret, folks.
[01:25:58.608 --> 01:26:00.169]  This is how controlled it is.
[01:26:01.229 --> 01:26:04.230]  Yeah, I just quit watching TV altogether.
[01:26:04.530 --> 01:26:06.231]  And that's, I think, the best sign we have.
[01:26:06.251 --> 01:26:12.474]  One of the best signs is that people are trying to give away these dish antenna systems and stuff because everybody's abandoning that stuff.
[01:26:12.634 --> 01:26:18.797]  Well, every time I tune in, it re-energizes me, though, just to watch how insane it is.
[01:26:18.877 --> 01:26:20.578]  Thanks for the call, brother.
[01:26:21.158 --> 01:26:21.418]  Go ahead.
[01:26:22.295 --> 01:26:23.095]  You were going to say something else?
[01:26:23.175 --> 01:26:32.899]  Yeah, a friend of mine was able to give a copy of your, six of your videos, hand-delivered to Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, and he said he'd watch it, so that's another good thing.
[01:26:33.459 --> 01:26:34.119]  Well, good job.
[01:26:34.139 --> 01:26:35.199]  You keep it up, my friend.
[01:26:36.180 --> 01:26:36.760]  God bless you.
[01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:38.440]  Let's talk to Larry in Alabama.
[01:26:38.460 --> 01:26:39.221]  Larry, go ahead.
[01:26:39.241 --> 01:26:42.322]  Yeah, Alex, I didn't know if you had covered this.
[01:26:42.382 --> 01:26:48.964]  I haven't been able to listen to the program, but yesterday on CNN, before the parade but after the luncheon,
[01:26:49.588 --> 01:26:53.710]  They were reviewing the troops on the steppe of the capital, I reckon.
[01:26:54.570 --> 01:26:59.653]  And they compared the swearing in of Bush to the coronation.
[01:27:00.733 --> 01:27:03.374]  I got it on video just while I was watching.
[01:27:04.115 --> 01:27:07.516]  Over and over again, they called him royalty, a royal leader.
[01:27:07.857 --> 01:27:08.657]  They were serious.
[01:27:08.877 --> 01:27:11.718]  Well, this person said... He's so handsome, he's royal!
[01:27:12.019 --> 01:27:15.460]  This person said that they compared this.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.881]  This was about one man.
[01:27:17.589 --> 01:27:21.870]  And it was compared to the King and Queen of England and a coronation.
[01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:23.350]  Did you get that on video?
[01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.990]  Yes, I did.
[01:27:24.231 --> 01:27:25.171]  Please mail it to me.
[01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:28.311]  I should know your address.
[01:27:28.411 --> 01:27:30.712]  I hear it enough that I better check it and make sure.
[01:27:30.732 --> 01:27:31.872]  3001 South Lamar, Austin, Texas. 787.
[01:27:40.307 --> 01:27:41.607]  Go ahead, 787.
[01:27:42.627 --> 01:27:41.607]  787.
[01:27:42.808 --> 01:27:41.607]  787?
[01:27:43.228 --> 01:27:43.928]  04.
[01:27:43.248 --> 01:27:43.928]  04, okay.
[01:27:43.948 --> 01:27:43.928]  78704.
[01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:48.549]  Yeah, everybody send me that type of stuff and clearly mark what it is on the tape.
[01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:50.789]  Yeah, I won't make a copy of it.
[01:27:50.809 --> 01:27:51.629]  I'll send you the tape.
[01:27:51.689 --> 01:27:54.130]  I'm sorry, but I did record it, FLP.
[01:27:54.250 --> 01:27:54.750]  That's alright.
[01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:58.231]  But I'll send the whole tape and who knows, well, it's got the whole thing.
[01:27:58.331 --> 01:27:59.831]  Yeah, just cue it up to that and give me that.
[01:28:00.031 --> 01:28:00.351]  Okay.
[01:28:01.031 --> 01:28:01.691]  I'll put a note on it.
[01:28:02.251 --> 01:28:03.772]  But what do you think about all this?
[01:28:04.632 --> 01:28:05.332]  It's ridiculous.
[01:28:06.252 --> 01:28:09.414]  I mean... What do you think about all the Diablo flashing?
[01:28:09.454 --> 01:28:13.936]  Again, we have detailed reports on all of this at PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:28:13.976 --> 01:28:17.317]  Folks, go... I mean, there's no way to cover it all on air, but just go read all of it.
[01:28:17.337 --> 01:28:20.079]  But what do you think about him and all these other world leaders doing this?
[01:28:20.679 --> 01:28:23.861]  Well, I think it's a sign that they're following Satan as their god.
[01:28:25.601 --> 01:28:28.023]  But AP claims it's the University of Texas.
[01:28:28.983 --> 01:28:32.065]  Why do we have Dan Quayle and George Bush Sr.
[01:28:32.105 --> 01:28:34.746]  and the Queen of England and Maria Shriver and...
[01:28:36.013 --> 01:28:37.255]  Elizabeth Taylor doing it.
[01:28:38.917 --> 01:28:39.978]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:28:40.239 --> 01:28:41.220]  Big interview's coming up.
[01:28:43.583 --> 01:28:44.504]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.965 --> 01:28:46.587]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:50.171]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.170 --> 01:28:55.631]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:55.851 --> 01:29:03.197]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:03.497 --> 01:29:07.920]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:18.028]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:29:18.789 --> 01:29:22.452]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:29:22.772 --> 01:29:25.275]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:29:25.575 --> 01:29:31.501]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:33.383]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:33.563 --> 01:29:34.464]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:34.544 --> 01:29:37.527]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:29:37.707 --> 01:29:38.588]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:29:41.090 --> 01:29:44.214]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:29:44.294 --> 01:29:48.359]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:29:48.499 --> 01:29:49.401]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:54.042 --> 01:29:57.045]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:57.386 --> 01:30:06.215]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:06.535 --> 01:30:11.200]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:18.387]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:18.787 --> 01:30:30.599]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:30:31.039 --> 01:30:35.503]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:30:35.683 --> 01:30:38.005]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:38.025 --> 01:30:40.007]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:40.027 --> 01:30:41.208]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:41.288 --> 01:30:42.749]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:42.769 --> 01:30:43.770]  Now get available in Iowa.
[01:30:55.353 --> 01:31:00.818]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.259 --> 01:31:05.483]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.723 --> 01:31:12.770]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:19.256]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.396 --> 01:31:20.617]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.937 --> 01:31:23.901]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:24.042 --> 01:31:26.064]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:26.385 --> 01:31:33.615]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:33.915 --> 01:31:37.360]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:40.865]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:31:40.886 --> 01:31:40.966]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:40.986 --> 01:31:41.106]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.226 --> 01:31:42.067]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.128 --> 01:31:42.388]  Call today.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:30.697]  Alright, coming up in the next hour, we're going to air large portions of King George's speech, plus, well, his perjury, or his violation of oath of office when he gets up there with one of the Supreme Court justices and tells the world he's going to uphold the Constitution, protect and defend it.
[01:32:31.158 --> 01:32:32.219]  We're going to play Cheney's
[01:32:33.323 --> 01:32:36.264]  swearing in as well and take your calls.
[01:32:38.064 --> 01:32:49.787]  But remember last week I read Ergonomics Today where the mid-car makers are going to put these infrared cameras in the cars that scan your iris and they pick up microscopic movements.
[01:32:49.807 --> 01:32:53.468]  Listen to the Houston Chronicle a few years ago and it will decide if you're tired.
[01:32:53.968 --> 01:32:55.948]  You'll have to retina scan before your car starts.
[01:32:56.528 --> 01:32:59.589]  It will decide if you're tired or if you're on drugs.
[01:33:00.429 --> 01:33:07.914]  And then the Ergonomics Day reported also that a bunch of big car manufacturers are going to start putting it in new vehicles as early as next year.
[01:33:08.014 --> 01:33:15.158]  There's moves to perhaps make it the law that's being discussed by the Department of Transportation and the Safety Board.
[01:33:16.081 --> 01:33:18.802]  That these systems will pick up distracted drivers.
[01:33:18.882 --> 01:33:22.504]  If you look away too long, it will warn you three times.
[01:33:22.584 --> 01:33:33.768]  And the next time, it will dial through a cell phone, just like your OnStar, to the emergency management centers that have been built in every region of every state of the nation.
[01:33:33.828 --> 01:33:38.870]  Even in rural areas, four or five counties get together with federal funds and build the command base.
[01:33:40.294 --> 01:33:43.975]  And they will dial in and you will be ticketed on the spot.
[01:33:45.035 --> 01:33:51.477]  It even said in some of the articles that arguing with yelling at your wife, the AI system picks up on that.
[01:33:51.837 --> 01:33:53.998]  But there's an even more advanced system.
[01:33:55.098 --> 01:34:01.160]  And this came out just a couple days ago in the Scotsman.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:03.981]  And this is posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:05.626 --> 01:34:26.000]  And it says, Machines which respond to their owner's emotions may seem like science fiction fantasy, but while living androids portrayed in the blockbuster film, I, Robot, may never be built, they're almost about to be built, folks, one firm has developed an emotion sensor which can help cars of the future make better drivers out of us.
[01:34:26.941 --> 01:34:28.222]  And it does voice print
[01:34:28.969 --> 01:34:32.671]  And it says it can tackle potential road rage, drowsiness.
[01:34:33.311 --> 01:34:36.552]  It monitors the driver's speech for signs of certain types of behavior.
[01:34:37.032 --> 01:34:46.216]  Actually, NASA has put some of these in similar systems developed by NASA, not by the great scientists we're about to talk to, in five of the airports.
[01:34:47.236 --> 01:34:50.838]  So, joining us is Dr. Christian Jones.
[01:34:51.710 --> 01:34:55.592]  And, uh, Dr. Jones, good to have you on with us, sir, from the United Kingdom.
[01:34:56.212 --> 01:34:57.553]  That's right, yeah, nice to talk to you.
[01:34:57.593 --> 01:34:59.814]  It's, uh, it's gone dark here at the moment.
[01:35:00.234 --> 01:35:02.335]  It's, uh, half five in the evening.
[01:35:03.416 --> 01:35:06.317]  Well, it's a sincere pleasure, uh, having you on with us.
[01:35:06.918 --> 01:35:17.803]  Uh, why don't, uh, you tell us, because your bio is so encyclopedic and prolific, it's prodigious, uh, why don't you tell us about yourself in a nutshell?
[01:35:18.737 --> 01:35:23.939]  Yeah, well, this all comes from my background in speech technologies and animation.
[01:35:24.899 --> 01:35:30.120]  My first work was in creating lip synchronisation for the animation industry.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:39.903]  So, the idea that you could actually record Tom Hanks' voice and automatically Woody in Toy Story would have the same lip movement.
[01:35:40.483 --> 01:35:47.205]  And this was the idea that it would help animators and help the film industry to create these CG movies that you see at the moment.
[01:35:47.805 --> 01:35:49.946]  Well, they have biometrics that detect your walk.
[01:36:10.630 --> 01:36:17.397]  That detect facial movements here that are now being tested in some airports, and it looks like you're upset.
[01:36:17.457 --> 01:36:19.018]  That may be a reason for questioning.
[01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:20.500]  I'm sure you've seen those articles.
[01:36:21.121 --> 01:36:21.741]  That's right, yeah.
[01:36:21.961 --> 01:36:30.970]  It is interesting how all this starts in sort of the animation sector, because obviously the biometrics and the walk patterns all come out of motion capture, which is used in the films.
[01:36:31.170 --> 01:36:32.171]  Did you see Forrest Gump?
[01:36:34.890 --> 01:36:35.370]  I did, yeah.
[01:36:35.871 --> 01:36:38.792]  You know when he walks up and is given the award by JFK?
[01:36:39.613 --> 01:36:44.275]  I know, yeah, the composite video, like aligning new footage with old footage.
[01:36:44.695 --> 01:36:51.039]  Yes, and then now we see Steve McQueen, 20-plus years in the grave, but he's back pitching Mustangs.
[01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:56.202]  Exactly, yeah, so it's interesting how you can do a lot with computer graphics.
[01:36:56.342 --> 01:36:58.083]  Doctor, did you see The Running Man?
[01:36:59.844 --> 01:37:01.164]  I think I have, yeah.
[01:37:01.244 --> 01:37:04.166]  Yeah, where the government creates fake newscasts?
[01:37:04.856 --> 01:37:06.296]  That's right, yeah.
[01:37:06.316 --> 01:37:10.177]  Couldn't this, I mean, couldn't this, this technology's old now, couldn't this be dangerous?
[01:37:10.197 --> 01:37:25.981]  Because I knew they had the software out there where if they can just get you talking, they can then take you and then create a fake of you and then instantly have whatever words they want fed in to a computer program that then moves your lips in exactly the way you would talk and you can put words in people's mouths.
[01:37:27.487 --> 01:37:42.115]  You've seen people do this for entertainment purposes, where we have some satire over here which has taken George Bush and edited his conferences in such a way where he's doing various songs and he's singing to Tony Blair.
[01:37:42.655 --> 01:37:45.057]  So, yeah, it can be abused.
[01:37:46.077 --> 01:37:55.343]  And what we've done, we started with this lip synchronisation, which is interesting in itself, but then developed this, essentially, emotion detection system.
[01:37:56.084 --> 01:38:06.751]  And so, like I said, we were going to use this in the animation sector, but then suddenly the ability to detect whether somebody's happy or angry or aggressive or surprised,
[01:38:07.271 --> 01:38:09.992]  ...have many more applications than just simply animation.
[01:38:10.873 --> 01:38:33.302]  And I'm sure we can all guess these, like if you're calling into a call centre, and you know, you're aggressive and you're angry, then it'd be great if you could monitor these calls, and so that, you know, you'd be able to get some information saying that, say, Ford have a great customer call centre because they can say that 70% of their callers are happier at the end of the call after talking to their agents.
[01:38:33.822 --> 01:38:39.365]  And you can get real figures like this because our technology will listen to all these calls.
[01:38:39.926 --> 01:38:50.772]  Are you aware of the Houston firm years ago that when the employees get to work they have to retina scan and it picks up microscopic movements and decides if they're tired or on drugs?
[01:38:51.939 --> 01:38:53.920]  Yeah, I mean, it's exactly the same sort of thing.
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:39:00.343]  The way that we've looked at this in the call center sector is that people are making calls and trying to sell you insurance.
[01:39:01.003 --> 01:39:04.945]  And the call centers want these agents, these people, to be motivated.
[01:39:04.985 --> 01:39:07.025]  They want them to be alert and attentive.
[01:39:07.486 --> 01:39:10.487]  And essentially our technology can listen to them as they're talking to you.
[01:39:11.307 --> 01:39:17.430]  It's certainly whether they're actually, you know, it's after lunch on a Friday and in fact they don't seem as motivated.
[01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:20.511]  And then ask Sir Jane if they have engaged in a thought crime.
[01:39:21.231 --> 01:39:23.213]  Exactly, yes.
[01:39:23.273 --> 01:39:26.195]  Some sort of liquid lunches might have slowed them down a bit.
[01:39:27.516 --> 01:39:29.198]  So it has many, many applications.
[01:39:29.658 --> 01:39:32.400]  Another one we've been looking at is the games sector.
[01:39:32.901 --> 01:39:38.645]  Because it'd be great if games of the future, computer games of the future, could actually be emotionally engaging.
[01:39:39.146 --> 01:39:42.829]  It's like the games now are all very visual and very graphic and very violent.
[01:39:43.930 --> 01:39:47.172]  And it's like the film industry is going for the shock tactic.
[01:39:47.592 --> 01:39:49.354]  And the graphics are superb and very realistic.
[01:39:49.634 --> 01:39:50.095]  That's right.
[01:40:07.632 --> 01:40:24.802]  I do, I've actually just got a, it's a, it might have that over there as well, this little game where you hold on to the four sort of joysticks and the light flashes in the middle and when the light turns green you have to press a button and the person last to press the button gets an electric shock.
[01:40:26.023 --> 01:40:31.990]  And that's a really sort of simplistic game, but again has this idea that, you know, you get pain if you don't play right.
[01:40:32.611 --> 01:40:36.596]  But essentially, I mean, it'd be great if you could make these games emotionally appealing.
[01:40:37.036 --> 01:40:44.826]  One idea, and engaging, one idea is that, you know, say you're playing your computer game and you're getting frustrated because you've been playing for the same, you know, playing for an hour on the same level.
[01:40:45.569 --> 01:40:55.515]  The game could actually detect that you're getting frustrated and angry with it, and suddenly some sort of help would appear, like there might be an extra power-up, or some tool, which will actually help you get to the next level.
[01:40:55.915 --> 01:40:58.857]  Or maybe you're bored, you've been playing the game for a while, nothing's happening.
[01:40:58.897 --> 01:41:03.660]  Well, imagine, sir, imagine the military application, because the first video games were developed
[01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:09.187]  To condition soldiers to shoot at people up close to get past that compulsion not to do it.
[01:41:09.628 --> 01:41:15.015]  And I'm sure the military will want to add these pain delivery units to the devices.
[01:41:15.055 --> 01:41:17.579]  That way it will bring people to the next level.
[01:41:18.351 --> 01:41:18.571]  It is.
[01:41:18.651 --> 01:41:21.232]  It's all about believability and realism.
[01:41:22.132 --> 01:41:24.513]  You want to feel immersed in whatever you're doing.
[01:41:24.893 --> 01:41:25.573]  And that's what I mean.
[01:41:25.593 --> 01:41:36.456]  This technology will obviously immerse you even further because whatever you're interacting with will know what state of mind you're in, know whether you're feeling upbeat or happy or know whether you're a really aggressive person.
[01:41:36.836 --> 01:41:41.157]  And therefore, the technology can try and adapt in some way for its purpose.
[01:41:41.657 --> 01:41:47.359]  And one of those things that we've been talking about is how you could actually help people driving by knowing what route they're in.
[01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:56.951]  Ah yes, and again we're talking to Christian Jones, doctor, professor, CEO of Effective Media Ltd.
[01:41:57.451 --> 01:41:59.872]  And the website is EffectiveMedia.com?
[01:42:01.012 --> 01:42:01.432]  That's right, yep.
[01:42:02.652 --> 01:42:09.234]  Sir, I want to get into the cars, because I don't think people in America and in England understand that
[01:42:10.097 --> 01:42:20.681]  The National Traffic Safety Board, and I've had members of the board on, I don't think they realize that every square mile of every major public road in the U.S.
[01:42:21.141 --> 01:42:25.183]  will have cameras scanning the license plates, scanning faces,
[01:42:25.683 --> 01:42:37.612]  I don't think they realize that MSNBC reported four years ago, three and a half years ago, excuse me, that they're going to put infrared cameras in all the cars so the children don't get locked in and burn up and die.
[01:42:37.652 --> 01:42:39.373]  That's the public reason.
[01:42:39.673 --> 01:42:41.254]  Now it's to stop road rage.
[01:42:41.334 --> 01:42:44.877]  Now it's going to be to stop distracted or tired driving.
[01:42:45.297 --> 01:42:49.140]  But again, that goes off of head movement and eye movement.
[01:42:50.121 --> 01:42:55.029]  But your system goes to another level analyzing the speech.
[01:42:55.089 --> 01:42:56.051]  Were you aware that the U.S.
[01:42:56.091 --> 01:43:01.961]  government is talking about linking these by cell phone uplink to police departments?
[01:43:03.122 --> 01:43:22.328]  I mean, it is all trying to... You can put it in a negative light with all these sort of intrusive cameras and the police force trying to intrude into our lives and into our driving habits, but from a positive point of view, it's all designed to try and improve driving performance and try to improve your safety.
[01:43:22.748 --> 01:43:30.451]  So, the fact that, you know, the cars listening to you or monitoring you in some way is all, hopefully, trying to assist you so that
[01:43:30.991 --> 01:43:32.253]  You're not going to have an accident.
[01:43:32.413 --> 01:43:35.518]  And if you do have an accident, you're going to be able to get away from the car.
[01:43:36.886 --> 01:43:50.893]  The way that we've been working on this is that our motion recognition technology actually has a sort of voice print analysis on it, so that as you're talking to your car, it will actually detect what mood you're in.
[01:43:51.113 --> 01:44:00.978]  Now you may say, well, currently I don't talk to my car, but in the future, and not so distant future, with the insight of things like... Toyota has announced they may be installing this!
[01:44:02.659 --> 01:44:10.784]  Well, if you think you've got GPS, you've got navigation, you've got sat-nav in your car, you can voice dial people as you're driving along.
[01:44:11.124 --> 01:44:18.089]  It makes much more sense to be able to drive and talk to your car than it does trying to press buttons, which will obviously distract you.
[01:44:18.449 --> 01:44:23.693]  A number of accidents people have had... And then again, it's been described though, arguing with your wife?
[01:44:25.678 --> 01:44:27.118]  Driving too distracted?
[01:44:27.138 --> 01:44:35.923]  The government is saying that after it warns you three times that the police department is going to be watching and you may get pulled over!
[01:44:36.818 --> 01:44:37.198]  Exactly.
[01:44:37.218 --> 01:44:46.944]  I mean, what we would like to do, rather than the heavy-handed approach, which really that sounds like when you put it in that way, is that... Just go ahead and get the system in.
[01:44:46.984 --> 01:44:48.065]  The fun can come later.
[01:44:48.685 --> 01:44:51.187]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:44:51.387 --> 01:44:54.289]  The technology actually is meant to be assisted.
[01:44:54.329 --> 01:45:00.453]  So as you're talking to your car about... You may be saying things like, look, I'm quite hungry.
[01:45:00.653 --> 01:45:02.294]  Is there anywhere that I can get a quick snack?
[01:45:02.734 --> 01:45:04.715]  And the car will actually know where it is, obviously.
[01:45:04.735 --> 01:45:05.215]  Yes, Dave.
[01:45:05.256 --> 01:45:07.036]  There is a place where you can get it.
[01:45:07.337 --> 01:45:10.578]  Dave, I've been quite confused lately, Dave, about the mission.
[01:45:11.179 --> 01:45:15.201]  The way we were all kept in hyperstasis before the mission, Dave.
[01:45:15.981 --> 01:45:17.602]  Dave, are you feeling alright?
[01:45:18.183 --> 01:45:23.406]  Dave, I think you need to go outside the ship and fix the EM-12 CQX unit, Dave.
[01:45:23.426 --> 01:45:24.686]  Open the pod bay doors, Al!
[01:45:27.773 --> 01:45:33.999]  But what about the problem here of the government having control of all of our cars?
[01:45:34.919 --> 01:45:37.562]  You know they're coming out with mechanized remote-controlled tanks.
[01:45:37.922 --> 01:45:41.045]  The whole Air Force in the next decade is going to go over to drone control.
[01:45:41.846 --> 01:45:46.330]  Isn't this a recipe for a few techno-tyrants to control the whole planet?
[01:45:47.303 --> 01:45:48.965]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[01:45:49.005 --> 01:45:49.545]  I'm afraid, Dave.
[01:46:06.261 --> 01:46:27.115]  What the intention is here is to simply, you know, the car will talk to you and engage you in conversation and try to, you know, improve your mood, try to help you and if it can do that subtly and talk to you... But also there's a lot of mental illness out there, it can be pre-programmed and this is being discussed to pick up that you're mentally ill and report it back.
[01:46:28.656 --> 01:46:35.458]  It's very amusing when you can throw all these anecdotal ideas.
[01:46:36.279 --> 01:46:37.239]  Sir, they're not ideas.
[01:46:37.279 --> 01:46:39.140]  These are being discussed by the bureaucrats.
[01:46:39.900 --> 01:46:40.320]  Exactly.
[01:46:40.340 --> 01:46:43.761]  Would you like me to... Doctor, Doctor, I'm sure you're a good guy, very talented.
[01:46:44.462 --> 01:46:46.542]  You sound like a genius.
[01:46:46.862 --> 01:46:48.403]  But I'm trying to explain something to you.
[01:46:48.763 --> 01:46:54.245]  Do you understand that the bad application will always be used by the military-industrial complex?
[01:46:55.386 --> 01:47:01.049]  I think it's also how we actually incorporate this and how much access we give to various people.
[01:47:01.509 --> 01:47:09.754]  I mean, we have rights to allow people certain access to information, certain data protection acts and certain sorts of services.
[01:47:09.775 --> 01:47:10.055]  Really?
[01:47:11.616 --> 01:47:14.620]  Well, we can, at every stage of any development, you build these in.
[01:47:15.381 --> 01:47:23.651]  And I know of studies where there's actually sort of a black box that you can put in your car which will track your driving behavior.
[01:47:24.852 --> 01:47:26.354]  All new cars sold in the U.S.
[01:47:26.454 --> 01:47:27.135]  already have the box.
[01:47:27.635 --> 01:47:28.295]  Exactly, yes.
[01:47:28.355 --> 01:47:33.477]  So, if you're a good driver, if you've got a good, you know, profile of how you drive, then your insurance can come down.
[01:47:34.077 --> 01:47:43.519]  And if you drive normally quite well, then what is the point in having this, what is the negative point of having this put into your car, and actually seeing your premium come down?
[01:47:43.579 --> 01:47:51.381]  So, what was wrong, what was wrong as the clocks striked 13 on the cold morning, as Winston walked to the Ministry of Truth?
[01:47:52.159 --> 01:47:58.141]  I mean, what was wrong with their being... Did you know here in the US, hundreds of schools have put cameras in the bathrooms?
[01:47:59.662 --> 01:48:01.782]  It's... There is some very bizarre things.
[01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:10.005]  In Edinburgh here, I can tell you that... I don't know if it's the same for you, but... You can't... You can't go to your nativity play and film your child.
[01:48:10.956 --> 01:48:11.637]  At that event.
[01:48:11.657 --> 01:48:16.284]  You can't film the sports day when you're running along trying to beat all the other fathers.
[01:48:16.304 --> 01:48:20.049]  For fear that this may be used by the wrong people.
[01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:24.795]  But the government can surveil everybody else.
[01:48:26.157 --> 01:48:27.800]  And it is that big brother approach.
[01:48:29.464 --> 01:48:34.426]  And there is so... We have to be careful at every stage to make sure that... Doctor, of course.
[01:48:34.446 --> 01:48:35.326]  I mean, Doctor Jones, look.
[01:48:35.446 --> 01:48:40.047]  Your application is like a gun, or a knife, or a computer.
[01:48:40.187 --> 01:48:42.788]  It's an inanimate object, not bad in and of itself.
[01:48:43.168 --> 01:48:45.229]  But I'm just... And I know you know this stuff.
[01:48:45.249 --> 01:48:46.829]  You're not ignorant.
[01:48:47.049 --> 01:48:51.851]  The government's racing ahead for total big brother applications that dwarf 1984.
[01:48:54.178 --> 01:49:03.250]  I mean, even iRobot, written in the past, particularly in the future, is very close to reality.
[01:49:03.290 --> 01:49:09.179]  If we start talking about robotics, and including this technology as part of that robotic system,
[01:49:10.598 --> 01:49:14.762]  Each of those androids is portrayed as a useful item, which will help our daily activity.
[01:49:15.062 --> 01:49:20.286]  But then, in the long hands of some tyrant, they become the world domination, as you're predicting.
[01:49:20.807 --> 01:49:22.008]  And it is that control.
[01:49:22.068 --> 01:49:27.072]  It's control of the technology, so that the technology doesn't control you, but you actually have control over it.
[01:49:27.132 --> 01:49:29.414]  And it then becomes a helpful thing, rather than a hindrance.
[01:49:29.454 --> 01:49:36.100]  Yeah, but built into this, built into this technology, is a pyramidal structure where it is going to be controlled by the government.
[01:49:37.970 --> 01:49:38.972]  Tell you what, tell you what.
[01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.114]  Doctors, stay there.

[01:49:41.976 --> 01:49:44.540]  I want to give you some more examples of this.
[01:49:45.181 --> 01:49:45.522]  Okay?
[01:49:45.862 --> 01:49:46.463]  Let me get back.
[01:49:46.564 --> 01:49:50.590]  And I want to talk more about the applications of effectivemedia.com.
[01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:51.291]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.866 --> 01:49:56.789]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.469 --> 01:49:58.771]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:50:14.842 --> 01:50:18.623]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:18.883 --> 01:50:23.524]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:23.624 --> 01:50:26.365]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:26.685 --> 01:50:29.866]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[01:50:29.906 --> 01:50:31.746]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:53:04.535 --> 01:53:08.937]  In 2001, October 1st, they passed a law 6 years before they said industry.
[01:53:09.437 --> 01:53:12.979]  Every cell phone sold must be satellite triangulated.
[01:53:13.039 --> 01:53:14.740]  That is, there's no satellite tracker in it.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:19.843]  There is a radio homing device that triangulates from the cell towers down to 15 feet.
[01:53:20.003 --> 01:53:22.924]  Really down to 3 feet, but the minimum law is 15 feet.
[01:53:26.661 --> 01:53:37.404]  They can also dial in and listen to you over the phone, and we've caught them with OnStar using NSA computers just randomly listening to people over the audio sensors on it.
[01:53:38.344 --> 01:53:45.886]  Almost all the major cable boxes sold in the last five years have a microphone in them, though there's no application for the microphone.
[01:53:46.653 --> 01:53:47.675]  I've talked to the technicians.
[01:53:47.735 --> 01:53:48.978]  I've seen the diagrams.
[01:53:49.479 --> 01:53:52.024]  They admit that they can listen to you over it.
[01:53:52.846 --> 01:53:56.352]  When Janet Jackson showed her breasts at the last Super Bowl a year ago,
[01:53:57.685 --> 01:54:01.987]  Tebow came out and bragged, oh, we know there was a record rewind and replay on that.
[01:54:02.007 --> 01:54:03.047]  People said, well, how do you know that?
[01:54:03.388 --> 01:54:04.448]  Because it's two-way.
[01:54:04.768 --> 01:54:07.829]  We're building psychological data algorithms on you.
[01:54:08.370 --> 01:54:14.972]  And so, this, you get mad and you scream at somebody on the road and, you know, go, I'd like to kill you!
[01:54:14.992 --> 01:54:17.353]  You know, just through your window.
[01:54:18.354 --> 01:54:20.715]  And, oh, nice men show up at your house.
[01:54:21.642 --> 01:54:23.083]  And, uh, they've got the recording.
[01:54:23.143 --> 01:54:25.984]  It's flagged, recorded, and, uh, data shifted up to them.
[01:54:26.004 --> 01:54:27.344]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[01:54:27.364 --> 01:54:28.305]  This is the official plan.
[01:54:28.645 --> 01:54:37.169]  So, uh, Dr. Jones, uh, I'm sure you're not a bad person pushing this voice print system, but I'm telling you what the government's gonna do with it.
[01:54:37.209 --> 01:54:37.849]  What do you say to that?
[01:54:39.323 --> 01:54:43.148]  It's scary when you put it in that way.
[01:54:43.689 --> 01:54:49.015]  All our designs have been trying to help people to drive more safely.
[01:54:49.035 --> 01:54:55.784]  When you think about how these technologies have been used in the past, it's like your shopping habits.
[01:54:56.444 --> 01:55:02.590]  You go and buy your food and suddenly they know exactly what you buy week by week.
[01:55:03.331 --> 01:55:05.893]  And then you get coupons for that in the mailbox.
[01:55:05.993 --> 01:55:06.574]  Exactly.
[01:55:06.634 --> 01:55:11.838]  If you've got coupons so you get food cheaper, that's not a bad thing.
[01:55:11.979 --> 01:55:17.604]  They actually learn what you'll absolutely buy regardless of price and actually jack up prices.
[01:55:18.855 --> 01:55:25.279]  I mean, if they can provide what people actually want and want to buy, then that's a good way.
[01:55:25.599 --> 01:55:27.020]  Doctor, this is your problem.
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:28.201]  This is your problem.
[01:55:28.221 --> 01:55:33.164]  You think you're a nice guy, so you think the rest of the world is nice, and I'm telling you it's not.
[01:55:34.126 --> 01:55:42.148]  I mean, the number of technologies in the past, historically, which have been abused and at the detriment of society is great.
[01:55:42.568 --> 01:55:50.469]  And the number of technologies which are coming out of the marketplace, which are, always start, like you said, with the mobile phone example of being able to triangulate.
[01:55:50.749 --> 01:55:54.730]  And people can put a spin on this and say, it's great, we can track our kids, we know where they are.
[01:55:55.150 --> 01:55:58.631]  If there's some sort of kidnapping, then we can always track where they've been taken to.
[01:55:59.131 --> 01:56:04.355]  And then other people can say, well isn't that, you know, it's terrible because your boss can track where you are.
[01:56:04.375 --> 01:56:08.798]  You know, you've gone out for your lunch break and somebody could track that behavior.
[01:56:09.038 --> 01:56:13.501]  Or they could try and predict that you were going to the wrong society, meeting the wrong kinds of people.
[01:56:13.901 --> 01:56:15.302]  And people can keep progressing.
[01:56:15.643 --> 01:56:16.163]  Exactly!
[01:56:16.203 --> 01:56:19.045]  Let's say we had a perfect government right now, we can trust them.
[01:56:19.245 --> 01:56:19.846]  Which we can't.
[01:56:20.106 --> 01:56:25.489]  But imagine these mechanisms of control in the hands of dictators.
[01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:27.411]  Imagine Hitler with these systems.
[01:56:28.975 --> 01:56:43.719]  In terms of, well, there's so many technologies out there that their global communication is so minute now, the world is so small, that information can be passed about so readily that the supporters of this are saying, well, we need to keep track of this information.
[01:56:43.759 --> 01:56:47.260]  And it's also very easy to put false data in on people.
[01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:50.121]  In terms of their records.
[01:56:50.726 --> 01:56:59.392]  Yes, and it's also, if one half of one percent is corrupt, which is a conservative number, we're talking about tens of millions of people getting into problems that's already happened.
[01:56:59.872 --> 01:57:02.514]  Listen, Dr. Jones, great talking to you.
[01:57:02.894 --> 01:57:04.175]  Effectivemedia.com.
[01:57:04.295 --> 01:57:16.583]  I hope that you'll think about what we've said as you develop these things, and I hope you'll be a supporter of liberty and only sell your applications to worthwhile things that are good for humanity.
[01:57:17.604 --> 01:57:19.185]  Well, we've knocked off policy in life.
[01:57:21.013 --> 01:57:23.975]  Well, I'm sure it is, my friend, but I hope we've given you something to think about.
[01:57:24.295 --> 01:57:26.916]  Thank you for spending time with us, and, uh, cheers!
[01:57:27.617 --> 01:57:29.117]  Alright, good luck, and, uh, take care.
[01:57:29.297 --> 01:57:30.218]  Take care, my friend.
[01:57:31.058 --> 01:57:33.039]  Alright, we just talked to Lord Jones.
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:34.400]  Nice fellow.
[01:57:35.241 --> 01:57:36.541]  And, uh, we'll be right back.
[01:57:37.001 --> 01:57:40.223]  Talking about the inauguration of his lordship.
[01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:54.792]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:55.472 --> 01:57:56.313]  You want answers?
[01:57:57.053 --> 01:57:57.974]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.594 --> 01:58:02.317]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.777 --> 01:58:06.960]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:14.344]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, already into our number two.
[01:58:14.384 --> 01:58:16.666]  We've been talking about torture, Governor Ridge,
[01:58:17.492 --> 01:58:22.057]  Our great leader of Homeland Freedom is telling us torture is good.
[01:58:22.077 --> 01:58:32.548]  The monster that was just convicted of torture, Reiner, has come out and said, well, I was ordered to torture, which is admitted.
[01:58:32.568 --> 01:58:33.589]  The documents are public.
[01:58:34.444 --> 01:58:39.145]  Uh, so we're discussing not just that, but the propaganda surrounding how we're being sold torture.
[01:58:39.685 --> 01:58:56.390]  And while Alberto Gonzales, our new Attorney General, says torture's good, and Ridge says torture's good, but then, oh, but we didn't order torture even though the memos are public and the documents are public, and it was Operation Copper Green, the different training they were being given, and being ordered by the CIA to torture people, including small children, in front of their parents.
[01:58:57.714 --> 01:58:59.596]  Pretty sick stuff, so I want to get back into this.
[01:59:00.376 --> 01:59:00.917]  Plus, U.S.
[01:59:00.957 --> 01:59:02.478]  officers want more troops in Iraq.
[01:59:02.498 --> 01:59:04.160]  Selective service being set back up.
[01:59:05.421 --> 01:59:10.826]  And we're talking about the Great Coronation coming up here in a couple days, two days.
[01:59:11.466 --> 01:59:13.568]  Stanley Hilton's 9-1-1 suit dismissed.
[01:59:13.628 --> 01:59:14.389]  Appeal pending.
[01:59:15.210 --> 01:59:19.033]  Was Robert Kennedy killed by a real Manchurian candidate-style assassin?
[01:59:19.333 --> 01:59:20.995]  That's the London Independent!
[01:59:21.690 --> 01:59:22.951]  Another one out of the Boston Globe.
[01:59:23.011 --> 01:59:26.834]  Martin Luther King's family still convinced the assassination was a conspiracy.
[01:59:27.014 --> 01:59:29.936]  XKGB and Stasi chiefs to work under Chertoff.
[01:59:30.056 --> 01:59:30.897]  New news on that.
[01:59:31.277 --> 01:59:33.219]  Every bus unveils its super-jumbo.
[01:59:33.299 --> 01:59:36.581]  European leaders hail the lead over the US.
[01:59:37.061 --> 01:59:39.443]  UK lawyer quits after terror law.
[01:59:40.003 --> 01:59:42.585]  Minnesota town hits 54 below zero.
[01:59:42.665 --> 01:59:43.666]  You think your town's cold?
[01:59:45.493 --> 01:59:47.196]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:59:47.617 --> 01:59:49.320]  Steve in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[01:59:49.380 --> 01:59:49.821]  Go ahead.
[01:59:49.841 --> 01:59:51.464]  Yeah, I just had a real quick question.
[01:59:51.844 --> 01:59:54.609]  I watched the trailer for your new Rise of the Police State.
[01:59:56.158 --> 01:59:57.958]  I was... Talk about torture.
[01:59:57.998 --> 02:00:02.679]  That guy looked like you had asked him if he had ever been in a ritual, and he looked like he wanted to rip your head off.
[02:00:02.719 --> 02:00:03.239]  Who was that?
[02:00:03.259 --> 02:00:04.280]  Was he a security guy?
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:07.520]  That was the Chief White House Advisor to four U.S.
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:08.961]  Presidents, David Gergen.
[02:00:09.001 --> 02:00:10.301]  I just said, what about the ritual?
[02:00:10.741 --> 02:00:11.921]  And he didn't deny it, did he?
[02:00:12.041 --> 02:00:13.782]  No, he didn't.
[02:00:13.802 --> 02:00:15.022]  He... I was shocked.
[02:00:15.482 --> 02:00:16.882]  That's going to be a great... Can't wait to get it.
[02:00:16.922 --> 02:00:17.562]  Thanks for your time.
[02:00:18.083 --> 02:00:18.883]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:00:18.903 --> 02:00:20.783]  I appreciate the call.
[02:00:20.803 --> 02:00:25.204]  Yeah, you can watch the trailer for Martial Law, 9-1-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[02:00:26.348 --> 02:00:30.530]  On InfoWars.com and PersonalPlanet.com, it's there on the main pages.
[02:00:31.450 --> 02:00:35.151]  Or just type Marshall Law Alex Jones Video Trailer into a search engine.
[02:00:35.952 --> 02:00:38.733]  And yeah, I'm trying to put everything into this film.
[02:00:38.753 --> 02:00:43.014]  You know, because if the globalists kill me, I want to leave something behind.
[02:00:43.034 --> 02:00:47.636]  You know, I want my... I'm trying to empty the contents of my little brain into something.
[02:00:47.656 --> 02:00:54.118]  You know, because that's what matters, is what we do, what we stand up for, and who we help.
[02:00:55.083 --> 02:00:58.645]  And I've just got a feel on it to make this a really good film.
[02:01:00.786 --> 02:01:02.547]  And I'm trying hard.
[02:01:02.567 --> 02:01:04.147]  We'll see.
[02:01:04.728 --> 02:01:06.829]  Alright, let's take another call here.
[02:01:07.269 --> 02:01:09.490]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ross in Ohio.
[02:01:09.590 --> 02:01:10.330]  Ross, welcome!
[02:01:10.931 --> 02:01:13.312]  Oh yes, I have a two-part question.
[02:01:15.293 --> 02:01:20.295]  The first is there is an arsenal about eight miles from where I live, the Ravenna Arsenal.
[02:01:21.326 --> 02:01:30.231]  And I just noticed while I was driving by there a couple weeks ago, they're, uh, building, uh, two new railroads back in through there.
[02:01:30.812 --> 02:01:37.176]  And, uh, this seems very, you know, reminiscent of something very... Well, how big is the facility?
[02:01:37.676 --> 02:01:37.856]  Huh?
[02:01:38.517 --> 02:01:40.398]  How big is this facility?
[02:01:40.418 --> 02:01:40.858]  175,000 acres.
[02:01:44.235 --> 02:01:47.698]  Well, they may be wanting to store equipment there, but they've got 18 wheelers to do that.
[02:01:47.758 --> 02:01:53.482]  And all over the country, they admit FEMA camps have been built, and they take old bases and expand them.
[02:01:54.563 --> 02:01:57.065]  But there's enough real, live, admitted prisons.
[02:01:57.085 --> 02:02:00.968]  I mean, we've gone from 1.3 mil in prison a few years ago to 7 mil now.
[02:02:01.028 --> 02:02:02.990]  They say there'll soon be 30 million of us in prison.
[02:02:03.190 --> 02:02:04.751]  They're criminalizing everything.
[02:02:06.132 --> 02:02:08.354]  I look at all the real, live camps that are in plain view.
[02:02:09.295 --> 02:02:11.076]  Yeah, but I've also...
[02:02:12.483 --> 02:02:16.125]  Staked out like a place across the street from back in the woods a little bit.
[02:02:16.505 --> 02:02:28.452]  Now I have binoculars and I'll see like army militarized vehicles driving with like flatbeds with different parts of that buildings and stuff and boxes of stuff.
[02:02:29.153 --> 02:02:30.714]  Which I don't know what are in the boxes yet.
[02:02:31.154 --> 02:02:35.537]  Well, I'm sure you could probably do a search on the city website to find out.
[02:02:35.958 --> 02:02:37.299]  It's probably innocuous.
[02:02:37.519 --> 02:02:44.403]  I've gone up and asked them what was going on and they refused to give me any information whatsoever.
[02:02:45.184 --> 02:02:49.587]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.747 --> 02:02:54.170]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.190 --> 02:02:55.571]  There is a chance
[02:02:56.071 --> 02:02:58.694]  To use this disaster with a new world order.
[02:02:58.774 --> 02:03:00.095]  A new world order?
[02:03:00.796 --> 02:03:01.597]  Can emerge.
[02:03:01.857 --> 02:03:06.081]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.141 --> 02:03:13.088]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.208 --> 02:03:15.210]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.430 --> 02:03:26.036]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.196 --> 02:03:31.558]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:03:54.652 --> 02:03:57.153]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:57.534 --> 02:04:12.103]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:12.143 --> 02:04:12.464]  government.

[02:05:31.114 --> 02:05:31.574]  That's 419-WORD.
[02:05:31.594 --> 02:05:31.734]  1-800-419-WORD.
[02:05:46.556 --> 02:05:52.581]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.202 --> 02:05:56.264]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.566 --> 02:06:02.350]  Alright, in the last hour, I went over Governor Ridge saying, hey, torture is a good thing.
[02:06:03.991 --> 02:06:05.032]  If it keeps us safe.
[02:06:06.253 --> 02:06:14.140]  At the same time, while they're doing this, all these different army soldiers and officers that are being convicted of torture, or of abuse,
[02:06:15.407 --> 02:06:18.289]  They try to spin it psychologically into a lesser thing.
[02:06:19.009 --> 02:06:22.232]  Raping people and killing them is not abuse.
[02:06:22.392 --> 02:06:23.292]  It's torture.
[02:06:23.352 --> 02:06:28.636]  It's sadistic, serial killer, American psycho type activity.
[02:06:28.656 --> 02:06:33.339]  And they're trying to, again, sell us that, well, it's to stop Al-Qaeda.
[02:06:33.839 --> 02:06:34.660]  Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[02:06:34.680 --> 02:06:39.803]  But at the same time, we have our leaders, Alberto Gonzales and Ridge and the rest of them, saying it's a good thing.
[02:06:39.983 --> 02:06:40.844]  It shouldn't be illegal.
[02:06:42.293 --> 02:06:46.495]  And then we have the government's own documents where they ordered these troops to torture these people.
[02:06:48.196 --> 02:06:54.019]  Now, the Brigadier General of Camp X-Ray two years ago, Rick Baucus, quit and said, I've been ordered to torture people.
[02:06:54.079 --> 02:06:54.739]  I'm not doing it!
[02:06:56.140 --> 02:06:57.721]  And so that never made the national news.
[02:06:57.781 --> 02:06:59.002]  I mean, it was on the news wires.
[02:06:59.122 --> 02:07:02.844]  Reuters, AP, and one Rhode Island TV station picked it up.
[02:07:03.844 --> 02:07:05.405]  The General wouldn't come on for an interview.
[02:07:05.425 --> 02:07:06.446]  He was told to shut up.
[02:07:06.586 --> 02:07:07.186]  I was told that.
[02:07:08.732 --> 02:07:10.393]  But Rick Baucus refused to go along.
[02:07:10.653 --> 02:07:19.998]  They can't even have a trial at Camp X-Ray because they've had like, what, five prosecutors and defense lawyers quit saying, these aren't real trials.
[02:07:20.338 --> 02:07:25.201]  So they can't even have a kangaroo court because good people are in our military and are going no way.
[02:07:25.701 --> 02:07:35.807]  Now these Chico federal jail guards that they hired and put into the military and commissioned as officers and sent over there, oh yeah, they've been having lots of practice on fresh meat.
[02:07:36.405 --> 02:07:38.526]  And this is how the psychology of torture starts.
[02:07:38.967 --> 02:07:42.889]  Well, these are criminals in our prison, so why shouldn't we just torture them?
[02:07:43.169 --> 02:07:45.171]  Or hang them in their jail cells?
[02:07:45.451 --> 02:07:48.313]  Or do biological and chemical testing on them?
[02:07:49.133 --> 02:07:49.894]  Type in, uh...
[02:07:50.817 --> 02:07:54.920]  Secret government program testing in Huntsville, Texas.
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:56.161]  You'll get Houston Chronicle.
[02:07:56.201 --> 02:07:56.601]  You name it.
[02:07:56.621 --> 02:07:58.322]  I've been covering this for six, seven years.
[02:07:58.623 --> 02:08:00.364]  The local town got sick from it.
[02:08:00.424 --> 02:08:01.685]  Jail guards got sick from it.
[02:08:01.925 --> 02:08:03.446]  And when you got sick, nobody helped you.
[02:08:03.686 --> 02:08:06.268]  Because you thought, well, these are criminals anyways.
[02:08:06.848 --> 02:08:09.951]  Why not kiss and bow weapons on them?
[02:08:11.051 --> 02:08:11.992]  You see how that works?
[02:08:12.012 --> 02:08:13.513]  I mean, that's been going on in our prisons.
[02:08:14.414 --> 02:08:16.915]  So now we're all, oh my gosh, they're torturing Iraqis.
[02:08:16.935 --> 02:08:17.576]  And it is bad.
[02:08:18.294 --> 02:08:21.297]  But then the sickos out there go, well, they're not human!
[02:08:21.517 --> 02:08:22.958]  Well, they're sub-human!
[02:08:22.998 --> 02:08:25.521]  Well, that's the same thing that goes on in our prisons.
[02:08:25.741 --> 02:08:34.128]  Well, they're a bunch of murderers in prison, getting fat, lifting weights, and watching cable TV, and they got hot tubs!
[02:08:34.869 --> 02:08:36.110]  Make them work harder!
[02:08:37.591 --> 02:08:42.416]  Uh, maybe Club Fed, where Martha Stewart is, uh, is nice.
[02:08:43.499 --> 02:08:48.641]  But they don't have jacuzzis or cable TV, unless you're a special federal case.
[02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:49.681]  No, no, no.
[02:08:49.761 --> 02:09:00.304]  The prisons are asbestos-filled, they're the older prisons, with tuberculosis in the walls, chemical, biological testing going on in many of them.
[02:09:00.664 --> 02:09:02.925]  You work for 18 to 25 cents an hour.
[02:09:03.365 --> 02:09:06.526]  If you want the most basic foods that are edible and not rotten baloney,
[02:09:07.651 --> 02:09:10.252]  And you go work, and then people go, good, Mike can work, yeah.
[02:09:10.672 --> 02:09:15.493]  Can you compete against 7 million people, 5 million of which work in the prison industries?
[02:09:15.833 --> 02:09:21.094]  Can you compete against a 5 million person workforce that gets on average 20 cents an hour?
[02:09:21.974 --> 02:09:23.234]  Oh, you never thought of that, did you?
[02:09:23.274 --> 02:09:28.975]  See, you've got to think of things in the multifaceted, multivariate, how they're interconnected, how they operate.
[02:09:30.115 --> 02:09:31.115]  That's what you've got to do.
[02:09:31.956 --> 02:09:33.836]  I mean, we ought to be scared to death of a government.
[02:09:35.094 --> 02:09:38.536]  That is openly promoting torture and every form of larcenous evil.
[02:09:41.037 --> 02:09:45.939]  And by afraid of it, I mean we should be concerned about it, and when I'm afraid, I fight.
[02:09:46.179 --> 02:09:47.480]  I don't engage in flight.
[02:09:50.141 --> 02:09:54.023]  And I certainly choose my battles, but I engage in the info war, and I want to be clear on this.
[02:09:56.364 --> 02:09:59.806]  A lot of patriots, a lot of whistleblowers have been killed.
[02:10:01.164 --> 02:10:01.524]  I don't know.
[02:10:16.289 --> 02:10:17.629]  I just love the beauty of life.
[02:10:17.729 --> 02:10:18.710]  I love the stars.
[02:10:18.770 --> 02:10:19.610]  I love the trees.
[02:10:19.730 --> 02:10:21.570]  I love my family.
[02:10:21.730 --> 02:10:23.071]  I just love decency.
[02:10:23.391 --> 02:10:26.852]  I love and I appreciate basic things like a good meal.
[02:10:27.792 --> 02:10:29.752]  Life to me is an incredible adventure.
[02:10:29.892 --> 02:10:37.694]  Every moment is just filled with amazing thoughts and ideas and just all these memories.
[02:10:38.494 --> 02:10:45.156]  And it's sad to know that when I die, all of that, at least on this plane of existence, will be lost forever.
[02:10:46.216 --> 02:10:51.099]  There'll be no more interfacing with humanity, no more on this plane of existence.
[02:10:52.119 --> 02:10:59.042]  And I'm very frustrated that I don't have the skills to articulate my worldview and the things that I understand and see.
[02:11:02.084 --> 02:11:07.266]  And I don't think... I mean, I know I'll be alive as long as God wants me to be alive.
[02:11:07.706 --> 02:11:14.790]  I've talked to a lot of soldiers who've been in combat, and they'll tell you that... It's like Colonel Craig Roberts says, his old...
[02:11:16.297 --> 02:11:20.860]  Or was it Baptist Grandpa when he was going to Vietnam as a sniper?
[02:11:20.880 --> 02:11:29.506]  He said, son, you don't worry because there's a lot of them Vietnamese boys that are only wanting to kill you and a lot of people dying around you.
[02:11:29.726 --> 02:11:30.526]  Paraphrasing this.
[02:11:31.887 --> 02:11:34.849]  But it's whatever God wants.
[02:11:34.869 --> 02:11:36.290]  If you're going to die, you're going to die.
[02:11:37.253 --> 02:11:39.034]  And, uh, you know, that's just the way it is.
[02:11:39.234 --> 02:11:40.415]  And really, that is the way it is.
[02:11:41.136 --> 02:11:56.466]  If we love life so much that we always go to the path of weakness, the path of compromise, the path of stagnation, if we love life so much that we cower in fear to bullies and despots and thugs and their secret police,
[02:11:57.794 --> 02:12:08.577]  If we love life so much that we're even afraid of what our neighbors think, and then subconsciously, psychologically, because this is most of the cowardice, twist our minds and make excuses for it, and deny it's going on.
[02:12:08.617 --> 02:12:10.198]  Most people just deny it's even going on.
[02:12:10.678 --> 02:12:11.758]  But deep down you know it's true.
[02:12:11.798 --> 02:12:14.379]  That's why you've got that sick feeling right now listening to this.
[02:12:16.399 --> 02:12:24.982]  And so, people want to hold on, they're so self-centered, so greedy, that
[02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:27.740]  That they are bringing death!
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:35.662]  And when all of you act like cattle, when all of you act like sheep, when all of you act like gazelles on the African plain, the lions come!
[02:12:36.622 --> 02:12:37.482]  And they devour!
[02:12:37.562 --> 02:12:39.382]  The wolves come, and they devour!
[02:12:40.863 --> 02:12:43.383]  Well, I'm not a sheep, and I'm not a wolf!
[02:12:44.923 --> 02:12:45.764]  I'm a sheepdog!
[02:12:47.524 --> 02:12:52.085]  And I don't like wolves, and I sardonically am angry at the sheep.
[02:12:52.165 --> 02:12:53.585]  I wish they'd become sheepdogs.
[02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:58.751]  And you know what, if a pack of wolves corner me one day and rip my guts out.
[02:13:00.172 --> 02:13:02.673]  You know, if they line me up and say, you knew you had this coming.
[02:13:03.573 --> 02:13:05.554]  And they strap me down and torture me.
[02:13:07.035 --> 02:13:09.056]  It doesn't matter, because let me tell you something.
[02:13:09.937 --> 02:13:10.737]  Let me tell you something.
[02:13:12.438 --> 02:13:16.620]  You look at your children, and you know the world you're giving them, and what you're putting them into.
[02:13:18.001 --> 02:13:20.082]  And if you won't do everything possible
[02:13:21.201 --> 02:13:32.506]  And if there is even fear in you, and you even have to think about doing something to stop this new world order, something is wrong with you fundamentally.
[02:13:33.587 --> 02:13:36.848]  The globalists put cancer viruses and vaccines on purpose.
[02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:38.109]  They've been caught a thousand times.
[02:13:39.089 --> 02:13:40.350]  They created the AIDS virus.
[02:13:40.610 --> 02:13:42.711]  Nobel laureates, it's public, it's admitted.
[02:13:42.911 --> 02:13:47.213]  The patents, the army funding, the naval funding for it, it's all admitted.
[02:13:47.233 --> 02:13:48.133]  Congressional testimony.
[02:13:49.274 --> 02:13:49.914]  These people,
[02:13:50.791 --> 02:13:59.136]  took GI's wives and gave them uranium pills when they were pregnant to kill their babies and to track what it would do to them.
[02:13:59.776 --> 02:14:07.920]  And if you can't stand up against this pack of psychopaths who take our troops and stand them out in the field and fly over and nerve gas them just to see what it would do to our own troops.
[02:14:08.621 --> 02:14:12.323]  If you can't stand up against these people, do you know how bad things are going to get?
[02:14:13.317 --> 02:14:23.522]  If you buy their lies and listen to their propaganda and feel good and take the easy path and make excuses to yourself, do you know the hell you're delivering this country into?
[02:14:24.963 --> 02:14:31.466]  This nation has been captured by high-tech, genius criminals.
[02:14:33.540 --> 02:14:52.446]  Organized crime societies that took over the Western world hundreds of years ago but couldn't manifest their full designs because the public wasn't wicked enough, the general population wasn't psychotic enough, so they made a conscious decision through the Carnegie Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, and others.
[02:14:52.666 --> 02:14:58.488]  They wrote the reports to destroy our moral fabric, to twist us so we would be tools of empire.
[02:14:58.688 --> 02:15:00.389]  And they've now captured this country
[02:15:01.155 --> 02:15:08.197]  And they are using it as an engine, as a power system, as a battering ram.
[02:15:08.737 --> 02:15:10.438]  They are forging us into a tool.
[02:15:10.498 --> 02:15:11.498]  That's what Terry's about.
[02:15:12.618 --> 02:15:16.059]  And your pension funds and your health and your safety don't matter.
[02:15:16.439 --> 02:15:25.522]  It's all the goal to dumb you down, to turn you into mindless idiots, to project you outwards as their military arm to take over the world.
[02:15:26.362 --> 02:15:28.043]  I've watched the Pentagon on C-SPAN.
[02:15:28.103 --> 02:15:28.483]  Admit it!
[02:15:29.286 --> 02:15:31.687]  Call it world government, say that's what it's about!
[02:15:33.207 --> 02:15:55.752]  And the people serving this, the people going along with this, are doing it deep down, 90% of them, at the higher levels, because deep down they're afraid of this, they got into it for power and control, as they got higher up in it, they found out just how evil it is, just how serious it is, and most of them, out of fear, energetically execute the
[02:15:56.750 --> 02:16:02.014]  Building plans, the blueprints of this monstrosity that is nearing completion.
[02:16:02.935 --> 02:16:04.296]  It is a wrecking ball.
[02:16:04.837 --> 02:16:06.338]  I can see the phases of it.
[02:16:06.738 --> 02:16:08.540]  It's laid out like a blueprint in front of me.
[02:16:10.237 --> 02:16:21.160]  Once they've taken over the third world, once they've got the world ID cards in, once they've got the whole planet with cameras on it, then they're going to start releasing the plagues, then they're going to start exterminating masses of people.
[02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:24.721]  Their official plan, 80 plus percent of us to be exterminated.
[02:16:24.941 --> 02:16:26.421]  And look, I know this sounds insane.
[02:16:26.641 --> 02:16:27.162]  It's true.
[02:16:28.942 --> 02:16:31.323]  Again, a lot of you have been listening for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 years.
[02:16:31.363 --> 02:16:32.763]  You know, everything I've told you has come true.
[02:16:33.103 --> 02:16:35.504]  Folks, you don't want to be in the next phase of this in the next 20 years.
[02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.430]  You think?
[02:16:37.551 --> 02:16:38.412]  I know, 20 years away.
[02:16:38.552 --> 02:16:47.143]  I mean, before that, to get us even more clamped down and straight-jacketed by the New World Order, nukes going off, bios being released, all of it.
[02:16:47.444 --> 02:16:53.452]  As they get us into this, and we give up more freedom, as they promise to keep us safe, then the next thing just gets bigger.
[02:16:54.824 --> 02:16:59.028]  And so many people in this system make the psychological excuse to deny what I'm saying.
[02:16:59.248 --> 02:17:00.829]  Well let me tell you something.
[02:17:01.290 --> 02:17:03.452]  You can set your watch and warrant on it.
[02:17:03.712 --> 02:17:04.693]  You can bank on it.
[02:17:05.153 --> 02:17:06.534]  You can guarantee it.
[02:17:06.995 --> 02:17:14.321]  This stuff is going to happen unless there is a mass revelation of understanding and resistance to it.
[02:17:17.224 --> 02:17:19.566]  And so facing this threat to the species
[02:17:20.704 --> 02:17:30.349]  I have the instinctive drive, if I have to throw myself into the gears of it, and be crushed by it, to stand in front of that tank like Tiananmen Square, so be it!
[02:17:32.851 --> 02:17:35.512]  There is not even a thought in my mind.
[02:17:35.972 --> 02:17:36.793]  I am committed.
[02:17:37.693 --> 02:17:38.414]  I am driven.
[02:17:39.574 --> 02:17:42.596]  I am possessed by the desire to defend life!
[02:17:46.272 --> 02:17:47.793]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:17:47.853 --> 02:17:50.235]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:17:50.595 --> 02:17:51.476]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:17:51.836 --> 02:17:53.057]  Oil War III has started.
[02:17:53.378 --> 02:17:55.819]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:59.622]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:00.063 --> 02:18:00.883]  Why else would the U.S.
[02:18:00.903 --> 02:18:03.886]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:18:04.126 --> 02:18:05.407]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:18:05.847 --> 02:18:10.330]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:18:10.751 --> 02:18:14.734]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:18:15.254 --> 02:18:21.156]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[02:18:21.416 --> 02:18:27.498]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[02:18:28.019 --> 02:18:28.359]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[02:18:28.619 --> 02:18:34.261]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[02:18:34.701 --> 02:18:37.322]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.

[02:18:45.470 --> 02:18:46.971]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[02:18:47.411 --> 02:18:51.733]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:18:52.133 --> 02:18:52.993]  It still is!
[02:18:53.613 --> 02:18:57.115]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:18:57.435 --> 02:18:59.236]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:18:59.796 --> 02:19:01.837]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:19:02.412 --> 02:19:04.433]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:19:04.813 --> 02:19:12.477]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:19:12.857 --> 02:19:16.639]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[02:19:17.319 --> 02:19:22.281]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing and precious metals kit.

[02:19:40.892 --> 02:19:48.113]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.873 --> 02:19:54.495]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:19:54.535 --> 02:19:55.275]  Supreme Court.
[02:19:56.047 --> 02:20:00.350]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[02:20:00.391 --> 02:20:03.993]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:20:04.994 --> 02:20:10.278]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[02:20:11.059 --> 02:20:19.346]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:20.907 --> 02:20:22.648]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800,
[02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.429]  516-8736.
[02:20:24.449 --> 02:20:25.129]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:25.169 --> 02:20:25.890]  Call now.
[02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:32.953]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:46.147 --> 02:20:50.670]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:20:51.010 --> 02:20:55.092]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:20:55.392 --> 02:20:55.933]  We listened.
[02:20:56.253 --> 02:21:01.236]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:21:01.516 --> 02:21:01.996]  We listened.
[02:21:02.377 --> 02:21:05.418]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:21:05.839 --> 02:21:06.379]  We listened.
[02:21:06.839 --> 02:21:09.721]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[02:21:09.821 --> 02:21:10.001]  I think?
[02:21:36.195 --> 02:21:37.236]  They railed against the crown.
[02:21:37.276 --> 02:21:38.096]  Another red tag man.
[02:21:38.116 --> 02:21:39.237]  Declaring independence.
[02:22:10.556 --> 02:22:17.742]  And the lives they leave far ahead of their time.
[02:22:18.402 --> 02:22:22.145]  All right, folks.
[02:22:40.817 --> 02:22:41.858]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:22:43.099 --> 02:22:45.940]  Without the renegades, Lord knows where we'd be.
[02:22:46.561 --> 02:22:49.423]  When it comes to heroes, the renegades are mine.
[02:22:51.364 --> 02:22:55.066]  Folks, powerful, strong men have always wanted to dominate.
[02:22:56.407 --> 02:23:02.411]  And if our ancestors, regardless of what color we are, didn't stand up, we wouldn't even have the freedoms we have now.
[02:23:02.952 --> 02:23:08.035]  Tyranny will go to the limit until it is met with force.
[02:23:08.655 --> 02:23:09.436]  Bullies will.
[02:23:11.676 --> 02:23:13.217]  We're talking about a lot more than bullish.
[02:23:13.817 --> 02:23:17.239]  Globalists couldn't live with themselves if they had a conscience, but it's more than that.
[02:23:17.459 --> 02:23:19.741]  They're not just sociopaths.
[02:23:19.781 --> 02:23:20.501]  They're sadists.
[02:23:20.901 --> 02:23:22.823]  They enjoy their work.
[02:23:23.663 --> 02:23:27.665]  They enjoy tearing the human spirit to pieces.
[02:23:27.705 --> 02:23:31.107]  They love to devour, because their father is the devil.
[02:23:31.608 --> 02:23:35.050]  And they're either possessed by the world and by its owner,
[02:23:35.911 --> 02:23:43.895]  Or you're possessed by God, you're filled by God's vision of what God wants, and you're either living for the devil, or you're living for God!
[02:23:44.475 --> 02:23:45.035]  It's simple!
[02:23:46.436 --> 02:23:52.138]  Now I'm sick of hearing you get on the radio, you sick filth, and talk about how the torture's good.
[02:23:53.159 --> 02:23:56.140]  You ought to be made to go over there to Iraq, and you should be made.
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:00.662]  You know, when you go to hell, you're probably going to have to watch them torture those Iraqi children forever.
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:08.605]  You're going to have to sit there as it's replayed to you in hell, and there's any justice forever as they torture those children to death!
[02:24:08.645 --> 02:24:09.425]  You filth!
[02:24:11.086 --> 02:24:13.408]  You demon-possessed trash!
[02:24:15.369 --> 02:24:17.631]  I've been in preacher mode lately, folks.
[02:24:19.052 --> 02:24:22.194]  I've actually been working, trying to finish this film like 18, 19 hours a day.
[02:24:22.214 --> 02:24:24.015]  I actually have more energy.
[02:24:24.175 --> 02:24:24.816]  It's weird.
[02:24:24.856 --> 02:24:26.357]  I'm sure I'll be exhausted afterwards.
[02:24:26.397 --> 02:24:27.818]  I've kind of hit a second wind here.
[02:24:29.238 --> 02:24:31.659]  And I talked about how I'm drinking coffee.
[02:24:31.699 --> 02:24:32.179]  Not a lot of it.
[02:24:32.199 --> 02:24:33.699]  Maybe one cup in the morning, one cup at night.
[02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:35.600]  But I was being honest about it.
[02:24:35.660 --> 02:24:37.581]  I guess that is a speed.
[02:24:37.601 --> 02:24:38.681]  I need to get off coffee.
[02:24:39.021 --> 02:24:39.461]  It's bad.
[02:24:43.182 --> 02:24:44.043]  Folks, we gotta wake up.
[02:24:44.063 --> 02:24:45.043]  We gotta fight this thing.
[02:24:45.743 --> 02:24:47.464]  Let's go ahead and take a call here.
[02:24:48.724 --> 02:24:49.804]  Barney in Maryland.
[02:24:49.844 --> 02:24:50.605]  Go ahead, Barney.
[02:24:51.105 --> 02:24:51.965]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:24:52.005 --> 02:24:52.625]  Two things.
[02:24:53.826 --> 02:24:58.087]  First, the Iraqi War was an illegal war
[02:24:59.765 --> 02:25:01.806]  And, uh, it was based on lies.
[02:25:02.767 --> 02:25:11.632]  And on the torture issue, everybody that was involved up the chain of command should be turned over to the Iraqis for punishment.
[02:25:12.512 --> 02:25:20.237]  Everybody that should have known about it on the chain of command and didn't should be replaced.
[02:25:21.197 --> 02:25:24.699]  And on the second... Well, look, it's admitted that the White House ordered all of this.
[02:25:25.180 --> 02:25:25.860]  It's admitted.
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:29.262]  I mean, it's public, but the media just keeps ignoring that.
[02:25:30.075 --> 02:25:30.656]  It's sick.
[02:25:30.676 --> 02:25:33.899]  What do you think about these people that call the Iraqis subhuman?
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:36.923]  Well, they're just out of this world.
[02:25:36.963 --> 02:25:38.604]  They ain't gonna get problems.
[02:25:40.266 --> 02:25:46.073]  But on the second issue, I would like to know what department or agencies or
[02:25:47.267 --> 02:25:52.695]  Uh, responsible for collecting the camera and other surveillance equipment on us.
[02:25:53.056 --> 02:25:54.017]  Here's how it works.
[02:25:54.217 --> 02:26:01.268]  The feds pay about 70% on average and then we have to supplement locally to put quote the traffic cameras in the last 10 years.
[02:26:02.319 --> 02:26:10.985]  Then they built, in the last six years, emergency command centers, even like you'll have four or five rural counties, even if it's rural, they'll have a FEMA command base.
[02:26:11.265 --> 02:26:27.415]  The cameras nexus through there, then are fiber-optic cabled or satellited into the federal government, into the NSA, into the National Traffic Safety groups, into the National Transportation Organizations, and so they all have
[02:26:28.636 --> 02:26:28.716]  Yep.
[02:26:56.002 --> 02:26:57.963]  Okay, well, buddy, you better pace yourself.
[02:26:57.983 --> 02:26:59.784]  We've got a long fight ahead of us.
[02:27:01.305 --> 02:27:02.285]  I know we do, Barney.
[02:27:02.765 --> 02:27:09.949]  I just, uh... I've been in this for 45 years, and you just have to take it as it comes.
[02:27:10.609 --> 02:27:11.490]  Ride the punches.
[02:27:12.110 --> 02:27:14.131]  When did you wake up to the new world order, Barney?
[02:27:14.551 --> 02:27:15.692]  About 1960.
[02:27:17.053 --> 02:27:18.213]  I've been fighting it ever since.
[02:27:18.273 --> 02:27:25.097]  We had good leaders, we had good workers, but we didn't have the means of communication we have today, and, uh...
[02:27:27.257 --> 02:27:30.758]  People weren't hurting, so it took all this time to get things going.
[02:27:31.099 --> 02:27:31.859]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:36.521]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.001 --> 02:27:38.602]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.522 --> 02:27:42.203]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.839 --> 02:27:52.222]  Hi everybody, I'm Tom Valentine of True Health, and let me tell you, I've found something that really can be true health for all of you.
[02:27:52.502 --> 02:27:52.823]  I use it.
[02:27:52.843 --> 02:27:55.184]  In fact, everybody in my family now uses it.
[02:27:55.224 --> 02:28:01.387]  It's called the Sacro Wedge, and it is a device that was invented by a football coach to help his athletes.
[02:28:01.787 --> 02:28:12.853]  And what it is, it's a wedge device, just a small one, that you put underneath your sacrum, and then you get down on it, you put your weight down on it, on the floor, and you let gravity do the work.
[02:28:13.254 --> 02:28:18.457]  I mean, you talk about back pains going away, chiropractors go away, you don't need them anymore.
[02:28:18.777 --> 02:28:19.877]  You gotta give it a try.
[02:28:20.238 --> 02:28:22.399]  So I suggest you take a look at the website.
[02:28:22.959 --> 02:28:24.801]  Sacrowegi.com.
[02:28:25.161 --> 02:28:28.123]  You can call toll-free 1-800-737-9295 and get all the information you need.
[02:28:28.143 --> 02:28:29.845]  1-800-737-9295 or go to the website sacrowegi.com.
[02:28:46.884 --> 02:28:58.162]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:28:58.382 --> 02:29:01.868]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:29:02.128 --> 02:29:06.351]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:06.611 --> 02:29:10.554]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:29:10.774 --> 02:29:17.319]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:29:17.539 --> 02:29:23.023]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:23.263 --> 02:29:27.846]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[02:29:28.086 --> 02:29:30.187]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:29:30.387 --> 02:29:35.650]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.950 --> 02:29:37.871]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:29:42.373 --> 02:29:43.654]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:46.920 --> 02:29:52.405]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:52.825 --> 02:29:57.068]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:57.289 --> 02:30:04.334]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:04.715 --> 02:30:10.820]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:12.181]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:12.521 --> 02:30:15.462]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:15.622 --> 02:30:16.503]  Eliminate the cost.
[02:30:16.583 --> 02:30:17.643]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:17.943 --> 02:30:25.186]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:25.486 --> 02:30:28.867]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:30:32.792 --> 02:30:33.733]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:33.753 --> 02:30:33.953]  Call today.
[02:30:48.695 --> 02:30:49.035]  Don't worry.
[02:30:49.595 --> 02:30:51.156]  This show is documented.
[02:30:51.636 --> 02:30:54.458]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.818 --> 02:31:00.060]  Yeah, it sounds horrible, the stuff we're talking about, but don't worry.
[02:31:00.120 --> 02:31:02.841]  Evil always implodes on itself.
[02:31:02.941 --> 02:31:05.102]  You had ten globalists left in a room.
[02:31:05.122 --> 02:31:08.564]  The only people on Earth, they would all start turning on each other.
[02:31:09.764 --> 02:31:10.465]  That's their nature.
[02:31:10.485 --> 02:31:11.745]  That's what they do.
[02:31:11.805 --> 02:31:13.366]  They're predators.
[02:31:13.446 --> 02:31:14.306]  They're more than predators.
[02:31:14.606 --> 02:31:17.928]  They're destructive, hateful creatures.
[02:31:20.396 --> 02:31:24.781]  We're taking your calls, talking about torture, and just decadence, period.
[02:31:24.801 --> 02:31:41.200]  How we're being sold evil, wholesale, pell-mell, here in America, and being forged into a dark, battering ram to take over every free nation, every sovereign nation, every rogue nation, regardless of who runs them, good, bad, the ugly.
[02:31:42.475 --> 02:31:44.959]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:31:45.000 --> 02:31:45.621]  Tim, welcome.
[02:31:45.961 --> 02:31:46.302]  Related.
[02:31:46.362 --> 02:31:47.324]  Happy New Year, Alex.
[02:31:47.524 --> 02:31:47.905]  Yes, sir.
[02:31:47.925 --> 02:31:48.205]  Welcome.
[02:31:48.466 --> 02:31:51.811]  Just like you, I'm surrounded by fascists and fools.
[02:31:51.832 --> 02:31:54.837]  I've given them the name step birds when you put
[02:31:55.692 --> 02:31:59.034]  So much information in front of people and like you say, they still want to deny it.
[02:31:59.074 --> 02:32:03.136]  They know deep down that they don't want to admit what's really going on.
[02:32:03.176 --> 02:32:04.597]  I wanted to pick up on something you said before.
[02:32:04.897 --> 02:32:06.918]  You said that you didn't have the skills.
[02:32:06.978 --> 02:32:08.159]  Alex, you do have the skills.
[02:32:08.199 --> 02:32:10.680]  You are a leader in this fight.
[02:32:10.700 --> 02:32:15.803]  You just don't have the opportunities that people get that are in tight with the mainstream media people.
[02:32:16.383 --> 02:32:17.164]  I don't even mean that.
[02:32:18.573 --> 02:32:23.774]  The time, the energy to effectively, truly articulate what we're facing.
[02:32:23.894 --> 02:32:31.356]  I don't think people realize how truly anti-Christ, is the only way to describe it, this global system is.
[02:32:31.416 --> 02:32:38.357]  And then even the so-called Christians, their churches have been compromised and they're there fooling them, not giving them the big picture.
[02:32:38.677 --> 02:32:41.478]  They are telling them that evil leaders are of God.
[02:32:42.198 --> 02:32:43.758]  It's just, it's sick!
[02:32:44.138 --> 02:32:46.839]  That's where my definition of Stepford steps in.
[02:32:47.738 --> 02:32:52.082]  Speaking of that, over the Christmas holidays, there was an interview with Ann Coulter.
[02:32:52.102 --> 02:32:52.803]  Did you catch that?
[02:32:53.243 --> 02:32:55.626]  In the quote where she said, I think it would be fun to nuke North Korea?
[02:32:55.646 --> 02:32:56.767]  Yeah, I think it would be fun to nuke people.
[02:32:56.827 --> 02:32:59.769]  I think we need to kill more civilians in Iraq.
[02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:00.770]  Unbelievable.
[02:33:00.790 --> 02:33:02.352]  Yeah, that was a big New York paper.
[02:33:02.432 --> 02:33:03.533]  I actually read it on there.
[02:33:03.553 --> 02:33:04.153]  Which one was that?
[02:33:04.393 --> 02:33:04.794]  I forget.
[02:33:04.834 --> 02:33:06.495]  It was one of the New York publications.
[02:33:06.575 --> 02:33:07.196]  I'll find out tomorrow.
[02:33:07.216 --> 02:33:08.237]  I think it was New York Daily News.
[02:33:08.297 --> 02:33:09.498]  I'll call you back tomorrow.
[02:33:09.558 --> 02:33:11.220]  It's posted on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:11.260 --> 02:33:12.661]  Yeah, it was just crazy.
[02:33:13.001 --> 02:33:15.682]  I mean, folks, she actually said we need to kill more civilians, that's the answer.
[02:33:15.922 --> 02:33:16.822]  She goes, our troops!
[02:33:17.222 --> 02:33:18.402]  Our troops just need to kill them!
[02:33:18.562 --> 02:33:19.583]  Just kill more civilians!
[02:33:19.603 --> 02:33:20.123]  Just kill them!
[02:33:20.323 --> 02:33:23.583]  I mean, I mean, this idiot who probably doesn't even know how to load a firearm!
[02:33:23.663 --> 02:33:26.484]  It's just, I mean, it's like Marie Antoinette let them eat cake!
[02:33:26.524 --> 02:33:27.504]  Just, just kill them!
[02:33:27.684 --> 02:33:29.225]  Just kill more of the civilians!
[02:33:29.265 --> 02:33:30.585]  That's what, that's what teaches them!
[02:33:30.625 --> 02:33:32.225]  Just, just smash them!
[02:33:32.265 --> 02:33:32.946]  Hell yeah!
[02:33:33.126 --> 02:33:34.726]  I mean, it's so decadent!
[02:33:35.186 --> 02:33:35.706]  It'd be fun.
[02:33:35.726 --> 02:33:38.567]  She sounds like she's been hanging around with Albright too long.
[02:33:38.707 --> 02:33:42.008]  It'd be so fun to just start nuking!
[02:33:42.408 --> 02:33:44.149]  Question about the inauguration this week.
[02:33:45.569 --> 02:33:47.390]  Yes, just the inauguration.
[02:33:47.650 --> 02:33:48.510]  The oath.
[02:33:49.050 --> 02:33:55.212]  Now, the Senator does not say, I promise to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.
[02:33:55.812 --> 02:33:57.633]  Yes, they violate the oath big time.
[02:33:58.956 --> 02:34:04.739]  You're right, the Patriot Act, the Homeland Security, that does nothing but eviscerate our Constitution, it reduces all civil liberties.
[02:34:04.879 --> 02:34:13.964]  And actually makes it easier in the new intelligence bill they just passed, the 9-11 overhaul, actually had amnesty in it, to accept all the fake ID cards of foreigners.
[02:34:14.905 --> 02:34:27.852]  And they're all impeachable offenses, and once again, people look the other way, which then they get branded by me a stepper, because if you're that brainwashed that you can't take all of this information and see what is really going on,
[02:34:28.462 --> 02:34:29.562]  Then you're completely brainwashed.
[02:34:31.082 --> 02:34:33.763]  Well, again, it's comfortable and easy to just deny it.
[02:34:33.963 --> 02:34:34.863]  Out of sight, out of mind.
[02:34:34.883 --> 02:34:37.224]  But that's not how the real world works.
[02:34:37.244 --> 02:34:37.784]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:39.524 --> 02:34:40.924]  And again, let me try to boil this down.
[02:34:41.204 --> 02:34:42.385]  Just as simply as I can.
[02:34:43.605 --> 02:34:44.405]  Here's an example.
[02:34:45.705 --> 02:34:47.926]  Democrats talk about how Bush is evil.
[02:34:48.926 --> 02:34:50.126]  Oh, he's for the Patriot Act.
[02:34:50.246 --> 02:34:51.166]  Oh, he's for the National I.D.
[02:34:51.286 --> 02:34:51.526]  Card.
[02:34:51.826 --> 02:34:52.766]  Oh, he's for torture.
[02:34:54.027 --> 02:34:55.787]  Well, you're prominent Democratic leaders.
[02:34:56.693 --> 02:34:57.974]  They helped write up a lot of this.
[02:34:58.014 --> 02:34:59.476]  They helped write up the Patriot Act.
[02:34:59.736 --> 02:35:04.561]  They helped push that more Democrats are voting with Bush than Republicans.
[02:35:04.581 --> 02:35:05.182]  Did you know that?
[02:35:06.123 --> 02:35:08.245]  On all these key votes, I've read the votes on there.
[02:35:10.107 --> 02:35:11.509]  They're actually the ones.
[02:35:11.569 --> 02:35:13.951]  It's a handful of good, real conservatives.
[02:35:15.473 --> 02:35:18.156]  Like Ron Paul and Coon and others.
[02:35:19.013 --> 02:35:19.833]  That are doing this.
[02:35:20.474 --> 02:35:21.214]  That are standing up.
[02:35:21.614 --> 02:35:23.315]  The Democrats helped write it.
[02:35:23.415 --> 02:35:26.057]  Bill Clinton helped set up the foundations for all this.
[02:35:26.277 --> 02:35:29.399]  Bill Clinton's out saying how great it is with George Bush and his daddy.
[02:35:31.500 --> 02:35:32.360]  It's like conservatives.
[02:35:32.420 --> 02:35:33.341]  I heard one this morning.
[02:35:33.521 --> 02:35:38.844]  A neocon on radio going, let me tell you, these Democrats want to drug all our kids.
[02:35:38.924 --> 02:35:39.704]  It's just horrible.
[02:35:40.525 --> 02:35:42.946]  They want to drug all our kids with Ritalin and Prozac.
[02:35:43.386 --> 02:35:46.828]  It's George Bush about to make it law that you have to do it.
[02:35:48.334 --> 02:35:49.114]  Not about to make a law.
[02:35:49.134 --> 02:35:49.874]  They just passed it.
[02:35:49.934 --> 02:35:51.195]  Forced psychological testing.
[02:35:52.115 --> 02:35:53.755]  They said they're going to put half the kids on drugs.
[02:35:53.795 --> 02:35:55.716]  I mean, that's the British Medical Journal, the AP.
[02:35:55.736 --> 02:35:56.656]  You can read the articles.
[02:35:56.716 --> 02:35:57.556]  It's the bill.
[02:35:58.637 --> 02:36:00.437]  I've had Ron Paul, Congressman, on about it.
[02:36:00.997 --> 02:36:02.057]  Other Congressmen on about it.
[02:36:03.078 --> 02:36:04.098]  Tom Tancredo on.
[02:36:04.118 --> 02:36:07.299]  I mean, it's real, folks.
[02:36:07.439 --> 02:36:09.899]  I could have called into that show and got a little George Bushes for it.
[02:36:10.140 --> 02:36:11.580]  Alright, you liar!
[02:36:12.180 --> 02:36:14.821]  Here he is, you commie.
[02:36:15.181 --> 02:36:15.781]  Again, so...
[02:36:16.676 --> 02:36:18.437]  People are all being given a false choice.
[02:36:18.477 --> 02:36:19.597]  Oh, the Democrats will protect me.
[02:36:19.637 --> 02:36:20.757]  Oh, the Republicans will protect me.
[02:36:20.897 --> 02:36:27.459]  Wouldn't they all go on vacation together and give each other awards and sit on the same boards together and go to the Bohemian Grove together?
[02:36:27.479 --> 02:36:33.621]  And go select their male prostitute they wish to, you know, spend the night with?
[02:36:33.641 --> 02:36:35.862]  And they even put it in the newspaper.
[02:36:35.902 --> 02:36:37.982]  Yeah, we're getting serviced by the porn stars.
[02:36:38.263 --> 02:36:38.923]  The gay porn stars.
[02:36:38.943 --> 02:36:39.283]  You know what?
[02:36:39.303 --> 02:36:39.723]  We're Christian.
[02:36:40.518 --> 02:36:43.100]  Then the preachers get up on the radio and rebuke me.
[02:36:43.681 --> 02:36:46.103]  Alex Jones is an evil devil.
[02:36:46.143 --> 02:36:47.864]  He told lies about President Bush.
[02:36:48.185 --> 02:36:50.767]  Claims he goes to a place called Bohemian Grove.
[02:36:51.428 --> 02:36:51.768]  What?
[02:36:51.808 --> 02:36:52.609]  I mean, submit it!
[02:36:52.629 --> 02:36:57.573]  I mean, it's just... Or, what about Stonewall Mounds?
[02:36:57.633 --> 02:36:58.594]  Well, that was when he was...
[02:36:59.364 --> 02:37:01.965]  Young man, it ain't just no big deal.
[02:37:02.145 --> 02:37:06.726]  Oh yeah, the order of death where you ask Satan to enter your body, Lucifer to enter your body.
[02:37:07.086 --> 02:37:08.186]  They believe Lucifer's God.
[02:37:08.526 --> 02:37:09.466]  And this is admitted!
[02:37:11.126 --> 02:37:13.007]  You wonder why stuff's getting so crazy?
[02:37:15.207 --> 02:37:17.808]  Alright, let's go to Len in Oklahoma.
[02:37:17.828 --> 02:37:18.448]  Len, go ahead.
[02:37:18.688 --> 02:37:19.248]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:37:19.328 --> 02:37:20.508]  It's good to talk to you again.
[02:37:20.528 --> 02:37:21.389]  Good to talk to you.
[02:37:21.629 --> 02:37:22.569]  Just a quick comment.
[02:37:22.609 --> 02:37:24.929]  Tonight, we're on Paula's Own on CNN.
[02:37:24.949 --> 02:37:27.890]  They're going to have a segment called Citizen Spy.
[02:37:29.602 --> 02:37:30.343]  I kid you not.
[02:37:31.644 --> 02:37:33.265]  And of course they'll say, is it good?
[02:37:33.585 --> 02:37:35.186]  Maybe it is good, maybe it's not.
[02:37:35.227 --> 02:37:37.348]  Just kind of soft-sell, put and sell it to us.
[02:37:37.628 --> 02:37:44.274]  Yeah, well the promo they ran featured a stay-at-home mom who has her computer hooked up, I guess, to the internet.
[02:37:44.314 --> 02:37:52.500]  And they showed a screenshot of the video monitor, you know, and it was segmented with different video feeds.
[02:37:53.421 --> 02:37:56.523]  And she basically stays at home and buys.
[02:37:57.184 --> 02:37:58.044]  Let me stop you.
[02:37:58.144 --> 02:37:58.725]  Let me stop you.
[02:37:59.699 --> 02:38:03.040]  Did you not hear me over a year ago screaming y'all about this?
[02:38:03.280 --> 02:38:04.000]  Absolutely.
[02:38:04.900 --> 02:38:09.001]  Now I knew about the federal program and the plan, but then it was in the New York Times.
[02:38:10.281 --> 02:38:25.624]  And by law, when we're all drafted, upwards to age 49, or when they blow the economy out, then you'll get a supplemental check, you're gonna get a government check, on a national ID card, you'll have to quote work upwards of 20 hours a week, sitting at a computer,
[02:38:26.557 --> 02:38:28.679]  Watching video feeds, but never from your city.
[02:38:28.720 --> 02:38:29.921]  It's always another city.
[02:38:30.802 --> 02:38:40.812]  And you watch the feed, now as a Big Brother spy, and the government says, in case you're not watching, they are going to insert false feeds.
[02:38:41.667 --> 02:38:50.212]  Computer-generated, showing a terrorist, go up to the power plant fence, showing someone spanking their child.
[02:38:50.252 --> 02:38:52.573]  This is actually in the news, because that's terrorism.
[02:38:53.414 --> 02:38:53.854]  I'm not kidding!
[02:38:54.014 --> 02:38:54.494]  I'm not kidding!
[02:38:54.574 --> 02:38:55.215]  I'm not kidding, folks!
[02:38:55.255 --> 02:38:56.035]  Listen to me carefully!
[02:38:56.575 --> 02:39:01.618]  They're going to superimpose video in test to make sure you're always watching.
[02:39:01.658 --> 02:39:03.699]  So this does about ten different things, but here's a few of them.
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:09.803]  Number one, it creates the psychological perception of those watching that
[02:39:10.714 --> 02:39:14.217]  They've done a big Pavlovian test on this at major psychology departments.
[02:39:14.237 --> 02:39:15.338]  We've even found documents on it.
[02:39:16.819 --> 02:39:24.046]  This creates the perception, like all the fake terror drills, that terrorism is a real widespread threat because you're watching the simulated terrorism.
[02:39:24.366 --> 02:39:31.713]  It also makes it fun like a game so that you don't get bored of it, but it also then
[02:39:37.053 --> 02:39:49.566]  But it just does so many things, and it also conditions us to accept the government inserting fake things in real things for our own good, getting us ready for more and more fake newscasts and all this generated.
[02:39:50.246 --> 02:39:55.672]  So understand, imagine, you're going to have to sit there and watch a screen, and then it's going to be tied into a live police feed
[02:39:57.094 --> 02:40:01.538]  They gave the example of you're in Baltimore and you'll be watching somebody in Chicago or you're in Houston.
[02:40:01.818 --> 02:40:04.260]  You'll be watching somebody in San Diego.
[02:40:05.061 --> 02:40:09.604]  That way you don't see one of your own family members, something bad happening to them or something, and then not go along with it.
[02:40:09.825 --> 02:40:12.046]  And then you're there reporting all crime and everything.
[02:40:12.467 --> 02:40:15.609]  And so you're telling me, I've got to take this, but I'm going to be on TV tonight.
[02:40:15.649 --> 02:40:17.671]  What time is Paula's on on?
[02:40:18.031 --> 02:40:20.033]  It's on at 7 o'clock Central.
[02:40:21.084 --> 02:40:27.028]  Okay, I'll probably type it myself, but if I don't, will somebody type this SP and mail it to me?
[02:40:27.068 --> 02:40:30.970]  So tell me in detail, just from a little blurb from the ad, what did they say?
[02:40:32.471 --> 02:40:33.271]  Describe it for us.
[02:40:33.472 --> 02:40:37.294]  Well, it was just a brief promo during the course of the program itself.
[02:40:37.394 --> 02:40:44.218]  It was probably 15, maybe 15 seconds or so in duration, but basically it's called Citizen Spy.
[02:40:44.238 --> 02:40:50.602]  They're going to talk about it tonight during the program, and they're going to feature a stay-at-home mom who has a computer, and they showed
[02:40:51.385 --> 02:41:04.130]  The computer monitor, and it was segmented, you know, with different video feeds from different locations, and it really didn't go into any detail, but apparently, I guess they're going to cover that, cover that in detail tonight.
[02:41:04.230 --> 02:41:04.790]  Is it good?
[02:41:04.850 --> 02:41:07.631]  Well, after 9-11, maybe so!
[02:41:08.091 --> 02:41:17.974]  Well, one of the, I'm sorry, I was just going to say, one of the things that they talked about rather extensively on last night's program was the lack of, you know, security at the
[02:41:20.194 --> 02:41:29.080]  You know, with the railways across the country, and they had Joseph Biden, and he was... And now we've got to have the TSA type searchers there, on the bridges, on the highways.
[02:41:29.120 --> 02:41:32.883]  Yeah, but I saw Rich two and a half years ago say, everywhere is going to be like the airport.
[02:41:32.903 --> 02:41:33.203]  Go ahead.
[02:41:33.403 --> 02:41:34.044]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:41:34.064 --> 02:41:38.087]  And they were talking about maybe, you know, needing to put cameras in and that kind of thing.
[02:41:38.107 --> 02:41:40.148]  They're going to search you when you go in the shopping mall.
[02:41:40.709 --> 02:41:41.509]  Right, exactly.
[02:41:41.549 --> 02:41:45.192]  But anyway, they're going to give... I guess they're going to give this quite a...
[02:41:46.007 --> 02:41:49.191]  What a bit of coverage during the course of the one hour program tonight.
[02:41:49.231 --> 02:41:54.719]  They haven't hired former Stasi Chiefs and KGB Chiefs, this is admitted.
[02:41:54.999 --> 02:41:58.644]  They haven't hired these people to bring them in to consult for nothing.
[02:41:58.904 --> 02:42:03.771]  I've seen old, it was the weirdest thing, they have a university channel here in Austin.
[02:42:04.711 --> 02:42:06.272]  Channel 18 or 22, I forget.
[02:42:06.292 --> 02:42:07.312]  They have a couple channels.
[02:42:07.532 --> 02:42:13.395]  They were airing old, but with dubbed in English, old East German TV shows.
[02:42:13.555 --> 02:42:16.316]  It was all propaganda about, she's a caring mother.
[02:42:16.536 --> 02:42:17.957]  That's why she spies on her neighbor.
[02:42:18.357 --> 02:42:25.780]  You know, you may not think that it's aiding the evil Westerners and engaging in terrorism to hoard food coupons, but it is.
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:28.941]  Overall, it weakens the state and hurts her children.
[02:42:29.261 --> 02:42:30.482]  That's why she reports them.
[02:42:31.002 --> 02:42:34.183]  And oh, look at the great bounty of it!
[02:42:34.683 --> 02:42:36.964]  And so this is basically what our news is now!
[02:42:37.244 --> 02:42:43.965]  And well, you know Alex, that's the exact verbiage they used for the, you know, during the promo that they ran during the program last night.
[02:42:44.145 --> 02:42:45.366]  Oh, she's supporting her children.
[02:42:45.486 --> 02:42:47.846]  Yeah, well, Citizen Spy is what they called it.
[02:42:48.267 --> 02:42:49.307]  I just have one last thing.
[02:42:49.347 --> 02:42:52.048]  What is the latest on ArnoldExposed.com?
[02:42:52.068 --> 02:42:53.088]  What's the latest with that?
[02:42:54.028 --> 02:42:56.129]  Well, I'll tell you, I've bid off more than I can chew.
[02:42:56.149 --> 02:42:57.170]  We're going to run the ads.
[02:42:57.450 --> 02:42:58.311]  I've made some stuff.
[02:42:58.731 --> 02:43:00.252]  We've extended out the contest.
[02:43:00.272 --> 02:43:01.353]  We've only gotten a few entries.
[02:43:01.693 --> 02:43:02.494]  Millions of visitors.
[02:43:02.554 --> 02:43:03.834]  Only a few entries.
[02:43:03.854 --> 02:43:05.175]  $2,000 prize for the best ad.
[02:43:05.856 --> 02:43:08.397]  And I'm busy trying to finish this film in the next few weeks.
[02:43:08.838 --> 02:43:09.678]  Martial Law.
[02:43:10.079 --> 02:43:11.059]  And it's going to happen.
[02:43:11.139 --> 02:43:12.160]  And we update the site.
[02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:12.880]  And we're going to do it.
[02:43:13.281 --> 02:43:13.501]  Great.
[02:43:13.701 --> 02:43:13.881]  All right.
[02:43:13.901 --> 02:43:14.742]  Well, thank you much, Alex.
[02:43:15.062 --> 02:43:15.342]  All right.
[02:43:15.382 --> 02:43:16.523]  I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:43:16.583 --> 02:43:17.043]  I really do.
[02:43:17.063 --> 02:43:20.265]  Yeah, it's just so sick, folks.
[02:43:20.305 --> 02:43:21.006]  Torture's good.
[02:43:21.026 --> 02:43:22.066]  We're going to spy on you.
[02:43:22.146 --> 02:43:22.727]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:43:23.636 --> 02:43:25.097]  Marijuana aids terrorists.
[02:43:25.117 --> 02:43:27.057]  We're going to arrest you as a terrorist.
[02:43:27.798 --> 02:43:31.359]  We're going to put your kids on drugs that actually Swiss cheese their brains.
[02:43:32.279 --> 02:43:34.140]  But don't smoke what George Washington did.
[02:43:34.160 --> 02:43:35.960]  Again, I don't like marijuana.
[02:43:35.980 --> 02:43:38.361]  I don't think it's good, but it's good for a few medical things.
[02:43:38.661 --> 02:43:47.524]  The point is, don't swat in people's houses looking for marijuana while you're pushing 15% of the kids already on the drugs that are 100 times worse.
[02:43:48.205 --> 02:43:48.765]  More than that,
[02:43:49.568 --> 02:43:50.889]  Hey Alex, I'm a new listener.
[02:43:50.909 --> 02:43:54.792]  Recently awoke out of the Matrix about a year and a half ago.
[02:43:54.872 --> 02:44:04.880]  I was a gospel singer and itinerating preacher for 25 years and moved to Nashville about 5 years ago and got into the media.
[02:44:18.555 --> 02:44:42.943]  And I just wanted to ask if you could put on the front of your webpage maybe a link to a page dedicated to giving us specifics, information on how to hold a town meeting, your resolution to fight the Patriot Act, specifics on your rules about copying and distributing videos, specifics on action that we can take.
[02:44:45.416 --> 02:44:53.219]  Well, basically, everybody just needs to start informing others and daily focusing and thinking about just how serious all this is.
[02:44:54.180 --> 02:44:57.721]  And people, I mean, it's not hard to set up town hall meetings.
[02:44:57.741 --> 02:44:58.962]  People should be able to figure that out.
[02:45:00.202 --> 02:45:06.084]  I came up with the idea to throw Patriot X out at the city and state and county level and put it out.
[02:45:06.145 --> 02:45:08.405]  People picked it up and expanded on it and ran with it.
[02:45:08.906 --> 02:45:11.827]  Last time I checked, there's over 400 cities and four states have done it.
[02:45:13.331 --> 02:45:14.692]  I mean, I can't think of it all.
[02:45:16.332 --> 02:45:17.813]  I tell you what, I mean, you got any ideas?
[02:45:17.833 --> 02:45:22.255]  I mean, I'd love to build a page about activism and solutions.
[02:45:22.315 --> 02:45:23.596]  It's just that I can only do so much.
[02:45:24.696 --> 02:45:25.696]  I hear ya.
[02:45:26.077 --> 02:45:27.257]  I couldn't find your resolution.
[02:45:27.297 --> 02:45:31.999]  Maybe your webmaster could put a link or something a little clearer on that resolution, because I'll just print it off.
[02:45:32.019 --> 02:45:37.542]  Well, just type in, um, Restoring the Constitution Resolution Alex Jones into a search engine.
[02:45:38.442 --> 02:45:38.682]  Okay.
[02:45:39.563 --> 02:45:40.263]  Anything else, sir?
[02:45:41.098 --> 02:45:45.742]  Well, I'm a preacher and I've been kicked out of many churches for preaching the truth.
[02:45:46.283 --> 02:45:51.488]  And I think that the problem with the Christians is they're looking to hirelings and false shepherds.
[02:45:51.588 --> 02:45:54.550]  The handlers are running the denominations behind the scenes.
[02:45:54.610 --> 02:45:55.691]  They're just hierarchies.
[02:45:56.072 --> 02:45:57.873]  That's not what Jesus and the apostles taught.
[02:45:57.913 --> 02:45:59.315]  They taught servant leadership.
[02:45:59.695 --> 02:46:02.117]  The apostles and the ministers had their own businesses.
[02:46:02.157 --> 02:46:02.898]  They were independent.
[02:46:03.368 --> 02:46:06.870]  It wasn't this big money-making, multi-level ministry scheme we have now.
[02:46:06.910 --> 02:46:17.577]  The people have got to start thinking for themselves, going to the crosswalk.com, looking up the scriptures in the Greek, like Romans 13, seeing what it really says, and start fighting for our country.
[02:46:17.597 --> 02:46:21.059]  Because the prophets didn't say the New World Order had to take over America.
[02:46:21.099 --> 02:46:21.980]  They said the world.
[02:46:22.340 --> 02:46:23.781]  And the world was the system.
[02:46:24.101 --> 02:46:30.025]  And the world was referring to Europe, China, Asia, and the cradle of civilization.
[02:46:30.065 --> 02:46:31.406]  They didn't even know about America then.
[02:46:32.086 --> 02:46:34.368]  God's given us this country as a place of refuge.
[02:46:34.408 --> 02:46:35.329]  We need to fight for it.
[02:46:35.609 --> 02:46:36.409]  We need to believe in it.
[02:46:36.429 --> 02:46:39.592]  Why do you think the New World Order is concentrating most of its firepower here?
[02:46:40.412 --> 02:46:43.515]  Oh yeah, we're the last ones that still have guns, and God is blessing us.
[02:46:43.575 --> 02:46:47.077]  But we've got to repent of this abortion and all our sins.
[02:46:47.218 --> 02:46:49.419]  If we'll repent of our sins, He'll heal our land.
[02:46:49.459 --> 02:46:51.201]  But He's calling the Christians to repent.
[02:46:51.501 --> 02:46:52.461]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:46:53.442 --> 02:46:56.725]  No, I mean, Christ spoke out against the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
[02:46:57.828 --> 02:47:02.930]  Up there parading around, telling the Jews how good Rome was, go along with Rome.
[02:47:02.950 --> 02:47:06.212]  You know, going after the zealots.
[02:47:08.233 --> 02:47:08.493]  Sick.
[02:47:08.513 --> 02:47:09.974]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[02:47:10.774 --> 02:47:12.715]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[02:47:14.596 --> 02:47:16.096]  Cheryl in Ohio, go ahead.
[02:47:16.917 --> 02:47:26.381]  Hi sir, I was wondering if you had heard anything on your local news in regarding some classified
[02:47:27.017 --> 02:47:55.380]  documents that now have become unclassified in regard to back during Vietnam, Gulf War I, Gulf War II, that they had chemicals that they could use on our men and women in war that they would be able to spray, that our men and women would be able to chase one another of the same sex.
[02:47:56.295 --> 02:47:57.596]  Yeah, that's come out.
[02:47:57.656 --> 02:47:59.278]  I mean, they've been developing this for a while.
[02:48:00.479 --> 02:48:06.624]  It's a super aphrodisiac meant to be sprayed on troops for the same sex.
[02:48:06.704 --> 02:48:09.307]  And that broke into the news again about a week ago.
[02:48:10.262 --> 02:48:10.502]  Yes.
[02:48:10.802 --> 02:48:13.484]  Yeah, and I posted it on InfoWars.com.
[02:48:14.224 --> 02:48:15.224]  It is on your site?
[02:48:15.484 --> 02:48:17.125]  Yeah, it's somewhere last week in there.
[02:48:17.465 --> 02:48:24.249]  Okay, because, you know, if that's not a form of torture in of itself, then I don't know what is.
[02:48:24.269 --> 02:48:26.910]  Well, notice how much of this torture is sexual, see?
[02:48:27.290 --> 02:48:27.410]  Yes.
[02:48:27.430 --> 02:48:28.851]  It levels for a bunch of perverts.
[02:48:28.931 --> 02:48:29.191]  Yes.
[02:48:30.151 --> 02:48:35.634]  And so, basically, who knows what they're, could they be spraying that in the chemtrails?
[02:48:37.000 --> 02:48:38.721]  They're doing all kinds of stuff, my dear.
[02:48:38.741 --> 02:48:39.281]  Good points.
[02:48:39.301 --> 02:48:40.542]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:40.562 --> 02:48:41.002]  We'll be back.
[02:48:45.405 --> 02:48:47.226]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.446 --> 02:48:50.528]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.668 --> 02:48:54.551]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.611 --> 02:48:58.853]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.193 --> 02:49:02.956]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.096 --> 02:49:04.897]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.437 --> 02:49:08.380]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:13.145]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.305 --> 02:49:16.348]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.528 --> 02:49:19.391]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.891 --> 02:49:26.017]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.537 --> 02:49:30.319]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:30.719 --> 02:49:32.100]  Order your video today.
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:33.501]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:49:33.541 --> 02:49:35.822]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[02:49:44.947 --> 02:49:51.192]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:49:51.312 --> 02:49:57.476]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[02:49:57.757 --> 02:50:06.143]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.443 --> 02:50:08.986]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter.
[02:50:09.126 --> 02:50:13.490]  And during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:50:13.771 --> 02:50:18.616]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:50:18.816 --> 02:50:24.241]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:50:24.582 --> 02:50:27.605]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight or nightlight.
[02:50:27.965 --> 02:50:35.896]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:35.976 --> 02:50:36.537]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:46.041 --> 02:50:46.662]  We're good to go.
[02:51:01.343 --> 02:51:02.003]  We're good to go!
[02:51:23.954 --> 02:51:26.035]  Simply log on to HerbalHealer.com.
[02:51:26.215 --> 02:51:30.656]  Check out our online member testimonials and our hundreds of exceptional products.
[02:51:30.876 --> 02:51:33.957]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:34.117 --> 02:51:40.078]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:49.641]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:51:52.841 --> 02:51:54.803]  There's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:54.883 --> 02:51:59.586]  Alright, third hour coming up.
[02:52:00.367 --> 02:52:03.229]  Tons of news.
[02:52:03.369 --> 02:52:10.595]  Your call is continuing at 800-259-9231.
[02:52:21.095 --> 02:52:33.441]  Before I go back into the news here, a little bit of news at the end of this hour, I just really call on all of you, every man and woman, black, white, old, young, to join me in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:52:34.082 --> 02:52:36.763]  To inform yourself about the true nature of the Globalist.
[02:52:37.624 --> 02:52:40.425]  And yes, to get my films, and to make copies of them!
[02:52:41.265 --> 02:52:46.108]  I authorize you, I beg you, I beseech you, on my knees, please take action!
[02:52:47.000 --> 02:52:52.864]  Get the films, jam them in the VCR, jam them in the DVD burner, and begin making copies!
[02:52:53.905 --> 02:52:55.246]  Give them to opinion makers.
[02:52:55.826 --> 02:52:56.807]  Give them to people.
[02:52:57.287 --> 02:52:58.028]  Educate others.
[02:52:58.108 --> 02:53:03.412]  I've made eleven powerful videos that are very informative and all documented.
[02:53:05.133 --> 02:53:14.940]  If you want to know what's really going on in the world, you want to have facts, you want to have a tool that has been very effective at waking others up, the videos will do it.
[02:53:16.147 --> 02:53:20.450]  For those that will watch the videos with an open mind, we're getting a 90% conversion rate.
[02:53:20.890 --> 02:53:23.091]  That is, they're waking up and agreeing with the information.
[02:53:23.291 --> 02:53:26.733]  And the next step is getting more informed from them and then taking action.
[02:53:27.654 --> 02:53:33.137]  The globalists have got to get us to at least be buffaloed by them or be confused by them so they can carry out their agenda.
[02:53:33.417 --> 02:53:35.218]  We have to shine a light on that!
[02:53:37.260 --> 02:53:39.821]  My videos are all over two hours long.
[02:53:39.841 --> 02:53:43.323]  Except for the newest one, American Dictators, a little under two hours long.
[02:53:43.423 --> 02:53:44.484]  Five minutes under two hours.
[02:53:45.490 --> 02:54:02.906]  On the DVD in about 95 minutes on the VHS, American Dictators exposes the false left-right paradigm of the election and shows the frauds that get sent to Skull and Bones and Bush and Kerry being cousins and all the other so-called things that they do that aren't very Christian or conservative.
[02:54:05.070 --> 02:54:06.192]  You need to have this video.
[02:54:06.933 --> 02:54:09.977]  If you buy one copy for $19.95, each additional copy is $5.95.
[02:54:10.398 --> 02:54:15.064]  I'm still offering this slash-rate special, same with Road Journey.
[02:54:15.084 --> 02:54:15.405]  $24.95 on DVD.
[02:54:15.425 --> 02:54:16.086]  Almost 3 hours, 170 minutes.
[02:54:16.126 --> 02:54:17.548]  Just 10 minutes short of...
[02:54:22.288 --> 02:54:24.249]  3 hours, each additional copy $5.95.
[02:54:24.289 --> 02:54:27.591]  So why not buy 5, 10, 20 copies?
[02:54:27.911 --> 02:54:32.053]  Give them as gifts, or sell them for $20 at your bookstore, or your restaurant.
[02:54:32.193 --> 02:54:33.953]  I don't care, just get it out to people!
[02:54:34.314 --> 02:54:34.894]  Please!
[02:54:35.874 --> 02:54:37.015]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:42.364 --> 02:54:44.146]  Triple 8, 253-3139.
[02:54:44.806 --> 02:54:51.972]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:54:54.915 --> 02:55:00.420]  Or you can, again, simply go to InfoWars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[02:55:01.829 --> 02:55:02.990]  That's all I'm going to say on the subject.
[02:55:03.030 --> 02:55:03.831]  I hope you take action.
[02:55:03.851 --> 02:55:06.032]  Another big solution is any talk show host locally.
[02:55:06.533 --> 02:55:07.914]  Tell them the truth about the New World Order.
[02:55:08.014 --> 02:55:08.554]  Promote them.
[02:55:08.594 --> 02:55:09.335]  Tell people about them.
[02:55:09.715 --> 02:55:10.516]  I broadcast.
[02:55:10.696 --> 02:55:13.939]  Tell people about it whether you listen on AM, FM, shortwave, internet, satellite.
[02:55:15.320 --> 02:55:16.441]  Spread the word.
[02:55:17.361 --> 02:55:19.363]  Expose Bush for not being a conservative.
[02:55:21.525 --> 02:55:23.927]  And get in people's faces that are promoting torture.
[02:55:23.947 --> 02:55:29.111]  These are sick, sick people on their way to becoming just bankrupt minds.
[02:55:30.134 --> 02:55:30.455]  U.S.
[02:55:30.535 --> 02:55:32.217]  officers want more troops in Iraq.
[02:55:32.397 --> 02:55:36.421]  UPI, despite the Pentagon's assessment, there are sufficient U.S.
[02:55:36.441 --> 02:55:37.483]  troops in Iraq.
[02:55:37.623 --> 02:55:39.385]  Officers there routinely request more.
[02:55:39.845 --> 02:55:41.207]  Washington Times reported Monday.
[02:55:41.307 --> 02:55:44.291]  Well, if they just say you don't need more, it's so.
[02:55:44.531 --> 02:55:45.392]  Learn to double-think.
[02:55:45.999 --> 02:55:49.722]  A retired general who asked not to be named because he does business with the Pentagon.
[02:55:50.142 --> 02:55:56.827]  In the newspaper, the open, often requested figure is six to eight more brigades or even more than 50,000 more troops.
[02:55:57.347 --> 02:55:59.168]  They are not bemoaning, not griping.
[02:55:59.208 --> 02:56:00.209]  It's just the way they feel.
[02:56:00.569 --> 02:56:01.910]  They need the source in it.
[02:56:03.031 --> 02:56:06.454]  General John Abizid, the U.S.
[02:56:06.494 --> 02:56:10.456]  commander in the region, was not requested a sizable increase in strength.
[02:56:11.097 --> 02:56:13.238]  The Bush administration has settled on troop U.S.
[02:56:13.278 --> 02:56:13.919]  forces of 150,000 troops in Iraq.
[02:56:16.178 --> 02:56:18.420]  For the January 30th elections, an increase of 12,000.
[02:56:19.601 --> 02:56:21.362]  There are no elections.
[02:56:21.823 --> 02:56:24.345]  No one's running against the installed candidates.
[02:56:25.145 --> 02:56:25.806]  That's admitted!
[02:56:26.767 --> 02:56:28.228]  But they keep calling it an election!
[02:56:29.629 --> 02:56:32.772]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with the third hour.
